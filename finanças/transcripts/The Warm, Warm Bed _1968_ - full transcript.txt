(soft music) (clock chimes) (soft music) - Good morning, dear. - What's the rush? Aren't you going to make love to me? - It's so late now, I haven't even got time to shave. - Oh, come on. - Look it, I'm going to be late for my-- - Damn briefings. - Well you know, we could have done it last night. - How could we do it last night? Herbie and Barbara were here until the early morning. And then I had lunch anyway. Why did you ask them over? - I didn't ask them over. They were here when I got home. - Well. Another three days of frustration. - You know, it's funny how all this frustration will go away in the bed. If you're so damn hard up, why don't you go down to the airport and meet me once in awhile? Instead of me having to go all over town looking for you. You know, Margie, I don't think you're so oversexed. You'll wear me down so that when I do go away, you won't have to worry about it. That's it, isn't it? - How could you dare say a thing like that? - Marge, you know what the truth is. Look, I've got a good job at the airlines. I bring home plenty of money each week. But when I've got to fly, I've got to fly. And it doesn't help my frame of mind any when I go away, to listen to these jealous and hysterical outbursts. - I'm hysterical? I'm jealous? It's always my fault. Well it seems to me that you have something to do with it. You're always away from home. So how do you expect a wife to act? - I expect my wife to act like other airline wives. They appreciate what their husbands do for them, and don't give them a hard time in between. - Most of the airline wives are too dumb to know the difference. - All right, forget the airline wives. How about our next door neighbors? Barbara, for instance. She doesn't complain at Herb when he goes away on a business trip. - Barbara? Why do you always compare me to her? Well, if you think she's so wonderful, then why don't you go live with her? You'd like that, wouldn't you? You didn't think I saw you last night in the kitchen, pinching her ass. If that's what you want, you can have it. - Now, you know I don't want that. You know, I'm glad you brought that up though. It's funny how every time I go around the corner, I run into Herb and he seems to have quite a guilty look on his face. He couldn't be doing a little pinching of his own, could he? No answer for that? Well, I got to get going. - Why are you leaving the car keys there? - I don't need them. - You don't need them? Well, how are you going to get to work? - One of my crew lives near here. They're going to pick me up. - Lives near here? Well, who's that? - Miss Shape. Shirley Shape, my senior stewardess. But I don't want you getting any wrong ideas. - I don't have any wrong ideas. I have the right idea. Senior stewardess indeed. Senior whore in the harem is more like it. No wonder you're so damn tired all the time, with that airborne cat house of yours. Well, go ahead and meet her. And have a good time in Chicago while I keep house. - Come on now, will you Marge? You know it's nothing like that. Here. Take this down and put it in the bank for me, will you? (soft music) - Hello, Peter? This is Margie. - [Peter] Margie. I've been waiting a couple of days to hear from you. - He didn't have a flight until this morning. - [Peter] Weather doesn't look too good today. Is he flying? - Yes, he already left for the airport. - [Peter] Well, I don't know. I heard on the radio that the weather was getting worse. - Honey, baby. Now, don't be silly. Once he gets to the airport, they'll hold him on readiness until the weather clears. They always do. - [Peter] All right, I'll come over because I have something important to talk to you about, anyway. - What is it, Peter? - [Peter] Never mind, I'll tell you when I get there. - Oh, well hurry over now. Little Margie can hardly wait until you get here. (soft music) (cheerful music) (loud crash) (cheerful music) (rattling) - Say, what is this? Barbara, you open this door right now. (rattling) Barbara, I'm warning you. Quit playing those silly games and let me in. Or I'll break the door down. (knocking) Come on, honey. Look at me. I'm all drenched. (plays piano) Barbara, Barbara. Bunny, honey. Look, you got me all soaking wet. I'm liable to catch a death of cold out here. (sneezes) You see that? - Well good, I hope it turns into pneumonia. What are you doing, sneaking around like a thief? What are you looking for, anyway? - I wasn't sneaking around, honey. I was just checking to see if we need a new paint job. - A new paint job. You creepy liar. We just had the house painted three months ago and you know it. You thought I was doing something wrong, didn't you? - No, I wouldn't do anything like that. I trust you. Now let me in and I'll explain it to you. Okay? Barbara. - Herbie Brown, before you explain anything, I just want to say one thing. I know you've been suspicious of me for a long time. - What made you think anything like that? I know you've been faithful to me. You love me too much. Don't you? - Don't be absurd. Who do you think you are, Casanova of the 20th century? - Barbara, where are you going? - Leaving. - You don't mean for good, do you? - That's an excellent idea. If I'd had half a brain, I'd have done that a year ago. (sneezes) (soft music) (loud bang) - Who is it? - [Peter] Peter. - I'm up here. - [Peter] Where? - In the bedroom. - Okay, I'll be right up. - I'm so glad you're here, darling. I didn't think Sam would ever get a flight. - I was anxious to see you, too. I've got something to ask you. - Not now. Just kiss me. Now. Get into bed. - Margie, it's very important. I can't concentrate until my mind is clear. - It couldn't be that important. Just take off your things. I've been waiting so long to be with you. - It's very important. I've got to talk to you. - All right, but, while you're getting undressed. - As you know, I just bought a new Jaguar. And the first payment's due. - So? - So, I need 200 dollars. Can't afford to spoil my credit. - 200 dollars? Peter, I'm not made of money. I'd be willing to help you. But a sum like that, Sam would question it. - Look, you said you'd help me out. You know, waiting around for you to call, it's impossible to hold down a full time job. Or maybe I'd better go. - Peter, don't do that. I'll help you. - Thanks, sweetie. You'll like it. It's bright red. You know, some weekend when Sam's away on a flight, we'll take a drive down to the cape. You'll enjoy that, just the two of us. - That'll be nice. Peter, I don't know what you do to me. But when you're standing there like that, I'd give you anything. - How about filling out a check for me, right now? - Oh Peter, don't be so commercial. - Just thought you might forget. - I won't forget. Now, come on. (clock chimes) (soft music) (doorbell rings) - Who is it? - It's Sam. - Oh my god, my husband. Come on, you have to hurry. - I'm up here in the bedroom. I'm up here, dear. Here. Hurry up and stay in there, and be quiet. - What about my check? - Forget it. - Oh, there you are, madam. - Who are you and what do you want? - Why, I'm Sam. The Whirlpool bath massage salesman. You did say come up. I know it's normal, but people in this business. And if you'll give me just five minutes of your time, I'm sure that we can make you one of our millions of satisfied customers. - I'm not interested in your Whirlpool whatever it is. Now get out of here. I said I'm not interested. Now get out of here, you're annoying me. - Lady, I can't let you do this to yourself. Madam, do you know that Ponce de Leon crossed this big ocean, crossed over all kinds of territory, all kinds of land, he slammed through big lakes, through swamps, through rivers, and he walked and he walked and he walked. He walked all the way down to Florida to look for the fountain of youth. But he goofed, he goofed. You see this machine? This is the fountain of youth. Do you know that? And I'll tell you something else. George Washington, the father of our country, he suffered from rheumatism, this guy. He had bad rheumatism, this guy. He ate and he ate and he ate. Do you know, he used to lay down in the stream, and let the cold water rush over him to kill the pain? Really. But he goofed, he goofed. If he had this machine, he wouldn't have to suffer. No sir, he wouldn't have to suffer. I'm telling you. Just for example, do you know that I sold 10 of these to airline pilots that have bad backs? - All right. My husband is also an airline pilot. I'll take it. How much is it? - Only 295 dollars plus tax. - All right, I'll take it. - Without a demonstration? - I don't want a demonstration. - But it goes with the product. - I'm not interested. To whom do I make it? - Whirlpool Inc. - How much is it with tax? - 309 dollars and 75 cents. I think you should have another demonstration. - Do you want the check or don't you? - Yes, ma'am. Here's my card in case you need me. - Come, I'll show you out. - Why don't you let me put it up here until you need it? - No, no. I don't want it in the closet. - Why not? It's a perfect place, it's right near the bathroom. Did you see that? - Oh, yes well, all of my closets have springs. It's much neater. - I've never seen anything like it. - I've changed my mind. I would like to see that demonstration. So if you'll go right in here, please. - Fine, fine, okay. - As soon as we're out of the bathroom, get the hell out of here. - [Sam] Did you say something? - Oh no, I didn't say anything. - This is really fascinating. You see, you see this here? You take your little feetsies in the bathtub, with your little feetsies, and you just turn this like this, like a paddle, see? Look, see? (chuckles) Isn't it nice? I love to sell these things, really. Do you mind? Thank you. Beautiful machine. Oh, it's so gorgeous, I love these machines. There we go. Alrighty. (hums) That's all there is to it. - [Marge] Well, I don't know. You'll have to set it up for me. I'm not very mechanical. (running water) - Well there it is, ma'am. All hooked up for you. - I suppose you're going to stand there while I take off my things and try out this machine. - Oh no, ma'am. That's against company policy. - Well, then you know the way out. - Oh, yes ma'am. Thanks for the sale, bye. If you have any problems, just call me. You have my card. (soft music) (phone rings) - Hello, who is it? - [Sam] It's Sam. - Sam? - [Sam] Yes, that flight was finally cancelled. I'll be home about one o'clock. - Oh, I won't be home then. I have to go downtown for a beauty appointment. I'll be back around five or six. You can get something out of the refrigerator. - [Sam] What the hell is that noise in the background? - Oh, it's a gadget I bought for your sore back. - [Sam] Sore back? - Yes, you're always complaining about a sore back after those flights. - [Sam] Oh yeah. How does it work? - I wouldn't know. I don't have a sore back. - [Sam] Well, would you tell the boys that I can play the championship game with them? - Another bowling night. All right. - [Sam] Thanks a lot. - Thank you. (clock chimes) (cheerful music) - [Shirley] Why the long face, Sam? Are you disappointed because the flight got cancelled? Sam, come on and cheer up. You're not mad at me for anything, are you? - [Sam] Of course not, honey. I'm not mad at you. It's my wife. - [Shirley] You two fighting again, huh? What's it about this time? - [Sam] Nothing in particular. She's so damn sarcastic lately. Well, you know how she gets. - [Shirley] Oh, let's not discuss it anymore. Where are we going? - [Sam] Well, I spotted a motel the other day near the beach. I thought we'd, we'll stop by and see what it's like. (soft music) - Hi, Mrs. Forrester. - Hi, John. - You having a problem? - Mmhmm. - You need some assistance? - I can take care of it myself, thank you. - Just let me help you. - Hey you, are you in this parking lot or what? What do I do with this car? - Yes, sir. - Pretty swinging parking lot you're running here. - Huh? Oh. The lady just had an accident with her pantyhose and I was helping her. - What do I do with this? Do I need a ticket? - No, you don't need tickets here. I just watch the cars for the merchants here. - Do a good job. It's worth 50 cents when I get back. - Okay, thank you sir. - Hey. - Yes, sir? - Need any help? - No, I think I can handle it. Besides, the lady's a friend of mine. - Mind if I watch? - We got to get this fixed. - Well, it's not my fault. - Give me that thing there. I think I have it. - Well, nevermind that. Just take the rubber thing and stick it in there. (laughs) There, that did it. Thank you, John. - My pleasure, Mrs. Forrester. - Hi, old timer. You the manager here? - Yeah, what can I do for you? - You got any vacant rooms? - Yeah, I've got plenty of vacancies. - Well, fine. - Hey. Isn't that an airline pilot's uniform you're wearing? - Yes it is, why? - Well, I always understood that an air pilot and his stewardess weren't allowed to be married. - Well, that's true. - So? - Well you see, our flight was cancelled and we've got, oh, about three or four hours to kill. And we thought maybe we might just relax and freshen up a bit. - Well, you better go into the office and register anyway. I'll show the young lady to the room. - Well, thank you very much. (soft music) (knocking) - Sam? - Yes. - Did everything go all right? - Just fine. Say, this place is all right. - But it still doesn't make me feel any better about this whole thing. - Oh come on, Shirley. You don't act like this when we're away on a trip in Chicago or some other place. - I know, Sam. But we've never had to lie before. To have to tell stories to people, just so that we can make love. It's not right. - That old guy couldn't care less anyway. - Oh, Sam. Sam? - Yes? - Did you remember to lock the door? - Oh, forget about the door. Only one around here is that old simpleton and he's forgotten the meaning about what we're going to do. - So, old simpleton, eh? I still know the meaning well enough of what's going on in here to kick you both out of here. - You've got a hell of a lot of nerve, busting in here like this. And how did you know I called you an old fool unless you were listening outside this door? - That's none of your business. This is my establishment, and I'm going to keep it. - Well could you at least extend the courtesy to allow the young lady and I to get dressed and wait outside? - Hell no, I'm going to stay right here and watch you until you're both out of here. - Why you lecherous old bat, you. - All right, Mrs. Hampton. I'll have you for next week. Fine. Bye. Now, where were we? Oh yes. That's more like it. - Pierre, somebody's coming. - Hi, Pierre. - Hi, Mrs. Forrester. - Cathy, how are you? We meet again. - Hi, Marge. That's a beautiful suit you've got on. When did you get it? - Oh, I don't know. It's something Sam brought back from Paris. Pierre, I know I'm a bit early, but I thought perhaps that you'd be free. - That's quite all right. Have a seat, I'll be with you in a minute. - You'd never believe what happened at the parking lot. - [Cathy] What happened? - Well, it's too long to go into details. But really, there are some very kooky characters in this neighborhood. - You know what I heard about Mrs. Cranston's daughter? - You mean, Candy? - Yes. Anyway, I heard that she got caught having an affair with one of her schoolteachers. Now, I think that's just terrible. I mean, what is this younger generation coming to? All they think about is sex. - Candy Cranston. You know how her parents are. They give her all the freedom she wants. - My daughter is only three years old, but if she ever pulled a trick like that, I would throw her out of the house permanently. I'm just trying to see that she doesn't get spoiled. Actually, I'm sure she'll grow up to be just like her mother. - Yes, Mrs. David. I'm sure she will be just as charming as you are. - Oh lovely, Pierre. Just absolutely lovely. Thank you so much, and I'll see you again in about two weeks, right? - Right. - Marge, I'll call you next week. - Okay, Cathy. - So long. - Bye. Now, what kind of a treatment would you like? - I don't know. I'm not sure. - She's gone to the beauty parlor and she won't be back until five or six o'clock. - It isn't that. I just feel funny with you two. Can't we go someplace else? - We're too known around here. Come on, stop being silly. Shirley, let me tell you about my wife. I'm not the kind of a guy that complains but, for the past four or five years, the motions and everything like that, but there's no spark. And with you, well, that's different. Now come on, get your clothes off. - What am I going to do with you? You're so oversexed. Sam, all these extracurricular affairs and all that, but when are you going to start taking me seriously? - Shirley, I do take you seriously. - I don't mean that. I'm not some tramp that just runs around the streets, sleeping with everybody. When are you going to leave your wife and marry me? - Shirley, you know the story. I just can't walk out on 10 years of marriage life. It has to be a mutual agreement. And besides, her parents are very religious. - Well then, I'm running around with a married man, doing all kinds of wild things. You have to consider my feelings, too. - I am thinking of you. But it just takes time. Why waste the few hours we have together going over the same old thing? - You know we can't talk when we're on a flight. And every time we're alone, all you want to do is make love. We've got to talk about this. - I promise you, on the next flight, we'll go out to dinner and discuss the whole thing. Now, what do you say we relax and have a little fun? (soft music) - Wait, you're messing my uniform. (soft music) (clock chimes) - Oh, it's that damn clock. - I thought it was the doorbell. - Come here. (soft music) - Thank you, Pierre. That's fine. By the way, you'd better tell your mother to keep her laundry where it belongs. - Yes, Mrs. Forrester. (doorbell rings) - Who is it? - [Barbara] It's Barbara, where's Marge? - She's at the beauty parlor. She won't be back until five. - [Barbara] Oh. I thought you had a flight today, Sam. - I did, but it was cancelled. - [Barbara] Oh, that's too bad. Can I come up? - Just a minute, Barbara. - Who is that? - It's my next door neighbor. Now I've got to get rid of her, or she's going to get suspicious. Come on. Come on. - [Barbara] Sam, is it all right if I come up? Are you decent? - Just a minute, Barbara. - I can hide in the closet. - No, listen, listen. Go in the bathroom. Get dressed. As soon as I get rid of her, then you can sneak out. Come on up, Barbara. Hi, Barbara. - Hi, Sam. What's that strange perfume I smell? That isn't Marge's. - Oh, it's a new perfume I gave her. - Sure has a funny smell. - One of the crew brought it back from Egypt. - I don't like it very much. - It's just a small bottle anyway. - We had fun the other night, didn't we? - We certainly did. - We've been neighbors for years, but I never thought you really liked me before. - Barbara, what gives you that idea? What makes you think that I wouldn't like you? - You're around those beautiful stewardesses all day long. And I'm not very busty, am I? - Well, I think you're quite cute. I've been waiting a long time to do this, without any interruption. - I know, every time we start something, either Herbie or Marge interrupt. - Well, we've got three or four hours. Come on, take your pants off. - [Marge] Sam, I'm home. - It's Marge. - It's Marge. Quick, in the closet. Hi, Marge. - What are you doing? - I'm getting a bowling bag. - So early? - Yes, I thought I'd go down and warm up a little for the championship game. Why are you home so soon? - I got an earlier appointment. - Oh, you look very nice. - Thanks. Aren't you going to change your shirt? - Oh yeah, that's what I was doing when you came in. - I suppose you're not coming home for supper tonight. - What did you say? - I said, I guess you won't be home tonight. - No, I'll eat at the bowling alley. (mutters incoherently) - What? - Nothing, dear. I was just getting a shirt, is all. I guess I'd better get going. I'll see you later. (soft music) - [Herbie] Is anybody home? - Yes, is that you, Herbie? - [Herbie] Yeah, I'm looking for Barbara. - Oh, I haven't seen her. Why don't you fix yourself a drink? I'll be right downstairs. (soft music) Oh, you startled me. - I didn't mean to intrude in a lady's boudoir. - That's all right. I was just trying to make myself more comfortable. Where's your drink? - I don't want a drink. This is my bowling night. - Yes. Sam just left to go and practice. - Oh, that's where he went? I just saw his car pull away. I wonder where Barbara is. - I don't know, I haven't seen her. She probably went shopping. - No, I just saw her car in the driveway. - Then she's with one of the neighbors. How come you're not working? - Well, I had a client nearby, and I thought I'd take the rest of the day off. Hey Marge, baby. Did you mean what you said last night? - Well. You know we were both drinking. - Not that much. - Look, Herb. At a party, this is fine. But, well, here and alone, we might be caught. - I guess you've noticed your husband and my wife. - Yes. What about Barbara and Sam? Do you know something I don't know? - I don't know anything definite, do you? - To tell you the truth, no. But I'm mighty suspicious of them. Every time I turn around, I see him with his arms around her. - I've noticed the same thing. You know what? They probably have made it a lot of times together already. - I think you're right. The best way to fight a forest fire is to start another forest fire. Right, Herbie? You did come over here to do something seriously, didn't you? - I've had eyes for you for a long time. Barbara's all right. She's just like a kid. - Well. What are we waiting for? You're not afraid, are you, Herbie? - Nah. - This'll show them. Sneaking around, cheating on us. - It sure does. It's hard to believe that they've been doing it all this time, and we haven't done anything about it. Wow, you got a lot more than she's got, too. - And I know how to use it, Herbie. (car engine stalls) - Is something the matter? - I don't know. My car stopped, and now I can't get it started again. - Well, I'll have a look at your car for you. - Would you, please? - Sure, glad to. Say, aren't you the same girl that picked up Sam this morning? - Yeah, but how did you know? - I live just a couple of houses away. And when I left this morning going to work, I saw the two of you getting in the same car. - Oh yeah, Sam and I work for the same airline. - Oh, I see. Well, I'll have a look at your car. - Please. - Okay, try it. (car engine stalls) Hold it. Okay, try it again. (car engine stalls) Hold it. Boy, you've got a problem. - Why, what's wrong? - Fuel pump's broken. - Oh no. Will you be able to fix it for me? - No, we can't fix it. We're going to have to have a new one put in. - Oh, well what am I going to do? I'm stranded here. - That's all right, I'll give you a lift. - Gee, I really appreciate that. You sure you don't mind? - I don't mind a bit. - Well, what are we going to do about my car? - We'll leave it here. Now, I've got a place up the road. We'll go there, make a telephone call, and drink at the same time, while the car's being fixed. - Sounds like a good idea. - Okay, you get in the car and I'll close yours up. - Okay. (quiet rumbling) - Who is it? - [Sam] It's Sam. - Sam who? - [Sam] Sam who? Your husband. - What do we do? - You've got to hide. - You creep! - Barbara! - I heard you in the bed with Marge. - What are you doing in the closet? - That's beside the point. - Now, you just wait a minute. That is the point. Just look at you. Nude, here and-- - But I heard what you said. You have bigger ones than she does. - Never mind what I said. What are you doing here? - Yes, Barbara, what are you doing here? - What the hell is this? Are you trying to make it with my wife, Herb? - Well, you made it with mine. - I did not. We were interrupted, weren't we? - Interrupted? By whom? - By you. - Me? I've got something to tell you. You interrupted Herb and me. - This is getting too complicated. Now, let's sit down and talk it over calmly. Look. For years, we've been kidding each other about switching wives or throwing our keys in the middle of the table, and living a modern way. Well, now it's out in the open. And I think Marge and I are both modern adults. How about you, Herbie? - Well, I think so. I am, are you? - Yes, but I heard what this creep said about me. - I didn't say anything that bad, honey. What do you suggest? - Well, neither one of us got what we wanted. Let's switch. How about it, Marge? Okay with you? - Sure, okay with me. - You and I are going to make it just fine. Aren't we, Herbie? Come on, Herbie. - I can't. - What do you mean, you can't? For years, you've been telling me you were a swinger. - I can't do it here. - What do you suggest? We go to another room? - Yeah, come on. - Herbie, don't get so excited. (soft music) - You're much better than Barbara. - I'm glad I found you out there. A damsel in distress with a broken down car. - What would I have done if you hadn't come along when you did? - Oh, I don't know. I imagine someone would have found you, but I'm glad I did. - So am I. (moaning) - Marge. - Yes, Herbie? - My glasses are getting steamed up. - Let me take them for you. (moaning) (clock chimes)
