Nike, a goddess of Greek mythology When originally discovered the arms and head were missing Later, the right arm was found but the head remains lost The unreconstructed statue is on display at the Louvre Museum Portrait of the Wind Murase Photo Studio How do I look? Strange? Very beautiful. You're at marriageable age now, aren't you? What do you say, Tamio? Too young, but fine feathers make fine birds. Don't be so rude. You're so beautiful, he's shy. I still remember you as a little girl. Now you're at university. Soon you'll be a granny. Watch out. You'll soon be an old fart. Don't be cheeky. Are you ready? Okay, change position. Like this? Look at the camera. Ready to shoot. Now. Won't you get some photos? Me? No, thanks. He may be sarcastic, but he's a good photographer. I don't like taking photos. Watch my hand. Are you ready? Now. How did the job interview go? Terrible. How about you? No luck, either. Is that right? No one wants art school graduates. Maybe not. But let's keep trying, anyway. How many interviews to go? Just one. And what happens if they reject you, too? I'll join the long-term unemployed. Look. That's Shinmachi over that way. I don't remember much. It's all changed since we grew up there. But one thing's for sure. That's the town I was born in. "Fine feathers make fine birds. " Don't you dare say that to Mari. Why not? Girls are easily hurt. Is she that thin-skinned? Silly! She's your kid sister. Let me see. Tamio. Tamio. Someone to see you. Great photo. Did you take it? Yes, three years ago. When I was in Palestine. Such beautiful eyes. A lot like your eyes. What? You think so? Her father was a suicide bomber. He died the day before I took it. She looks so strong and powerful. Yes, but there's also the sadness of losing a loved one. But she didn't cry at all. People don't always cry when they're sad. So what can I do for you? I have something to ask you. What do you do with your negatives? We file them away. Even the old ones? They're a photographer's treasure. Are you after some? Yes, from about 20 years ago. Taken here? We dispose of them after 10 years with no orders for prints. I see. Sure. Thanks. But hang on. My father kept the ones he particularly liked. Want to look through them? Sure. They're filed by surname. Suzuki... Suzuki... This one? That's not it. That's a great clock. Grandpa got it when he opened the studio. Not working? It'd cost more to fix it than to buy a new one. But I can't just throw it away. This one? That's not it. When I was a boy, it still worked. It has such a beautiful chime. Here's another. How about this? Is this it? Who's the girl? That's me. You lived around here? When I was 5 my parents divorced and moved away. - Here. - Thanks. Thank you. He always wanted to be the Japanese Capa. Don't start. But his dad died on his feet of a heart attack. So he got stuck with the studio. That was bad luck. That's enough. Before that, he flew all over the world. But now he's stuck in a local photo studio. I think it's great. What is? Working at an old photo studio. Everyone's got digital cameras now. Photo studios are being replaced by apartments. They're out of fashion. But studios are a record of the local people's precious moments. I think that's wonderful. They're just like time capsules, aren't they? All the happiness of the local people. Did you ever play here when you were little? You don't remember? What's wrong? No, it's nothing. Hey, give me a ride. On the bicycle? Sure. Hey. Take your hands off. Make like wings. Close your eyes. What? Close your eyes. That hurt. Are you okay? Hey? I was worried. - Are you sure? - It hurt. Naturally. That was dangerous. I got a real shock. Thank you for the photo. Come again any time. Take care. See you. Listen. What? Anything between you and Tamio? What do you mean? I thought maybe you were in love with him. What? With Tamio? You must be joking. So you don't love him? He's just an old friend. A friend of my brother and a good customer, that's all. Nothing more. Really? Sure. Are you sure? I'm positive. You're so full of beans. Beer. And green peppers. Grilled green peppers, please. You were like a man reborn today. How's that? You behaved differently. No, I didn't. You big liar. I bet you have a sore shoulder tomorrow. I'll be fine. Beer, please. For me, too. What a doll! Does she live near here? She's Mari's classmate. From art school? Got a boyfriend? Someone you love? What's that? Don't be so rude. Leave them alone. Don't get too ambitious. Know your place. He's right. But she's really beautiful. I hope he's alright. I guess so, he could walk by himself. But he lost so much blood. I was too scared to move. That's natural. As a photographer, I've seen far worse than that. Blood doesn't scare me any more. When you see so much death around you, it's as if your heart is like a bomb. Laws and morals lose all their meaning. Death no longer scares you. It becomes the only way to keep your dignity as a human. It's like being dead, even when you're alive. Will you go back to Palestine? Not any more. I thought you would. You keep that picture of the girl on your wall. I won't go back. Why not? Just being there made me way too callous. I'd take pictures of people dying before my eyes. I'm too scared of losing all emotion. I'm burned out as a news cameraman. I can't get the shots. But photographs express someone s joy or grief to others, don't they? And I really sensed her grief from your photograph. Because you took that picture, I was able to share that little girl's grief. You're just being nice. No, I mean it. I wonder what Nike looked like. That's the point. What was her face like and what was she looking at. I like not knowing. You're forced to use your imagination. Doesn't that make it truly wonderful? Once I tried to draw her face in one of my classes. No matter how hard I tried, I didn't like any of them. I have no happy memories of my family. Father used to beat Mother when he was drunk. Once he lost control, there was no stopping him. Mom was always battered and bruised. One of my relatives told me. But, when I first met you, I couldn't get you out of my mind. Now I know why. It's because we're the same kind of person. Private Party When's the baby due? What are you on about? They're having a baby. You did it, handsome. When's it due? Next January. Less than 9 months? When it comes to love, he's a fast mover. Let's get drunk. Congratulations to the happy couple May they live long Until they're both old and gray Good morning. I was dreaming. What about? There was this little girl. A tiny little girl. She was looking at the sea. She spread her arms as the sea breeze blew on her. Where was it? No idea. But it was very beautiful. Maybe it was our little girl? I guess it was. Then let's have a baby girl. Let's take her photo every day. Good idea. Let's do that. No need to memorize everything at once. Thank you. Look, right now your first priority is the baby. I know. I'm being very careful. Three months is the most dangerous time. You must be very careful. Especially with your first. Aren't you due at the hospital? Hospital? Right. I'd better hurry. Now you take care. Mom. Did you think I was your Mom? No need to worry. We'll find her. Hello? Is this child's mother about? Are you there? I'm sorry. Thank you so much. Say thank you. Thank you. That was very kind of you. Delivery for you. Yes? The neighbors all envy me. How come? I'm lucky to have such a dear daughter-in-law. Is that right? If only your father were still alive. He'd love to see his first grandchild. This is your wife's watch? According to the autopsy, she was strangled to death. What did he have to say? Apparently, he'd never set eyes on her before. Then why did he have to kill her? I'm afraid that will take some time to resolve. You mean through a trial? Yes, but a closed trial. What do you mean? All criminals under the age of 20, are tried in a closed, juvenile court. What? The entire proceedings are carried out in secrecy. Match them up and run them through here. Turn off the light. This red button next to it, turn it on. Then switch this on. And it comes out here. Can you tell us something about the victim? Any comments about Ayako? Anything at all. Please. You have to eat, or you'll get ill. It's the best I can do, but try it. Thank you. I never knew Ayako was taking pictures. May I? I wonder what that was? Closed Why are the victim's relatives excluded from the process? With an adult, the courts are designed to punish. But with juveniles, the aim is to rehabilitate. And he is to be tried in juvenile court. I'm not interested in his rehabilitation. Why is he so protected? We're the victims, not him! Of course. But it's different for juveniles. Who cares about who or what he is? We want to know why he did it. I have to know. You can get to see the transcript. This is ridiculous. Did you plan to kill her? No, not at all. I never wanted to kill her. Then why did you choke her to death? She resisted, I wanted to stop her screaming. Before I realized it, I was choking her. What did you think when she stopped moving? I never imagined she was dead. I'll change the question. Your mother abandoned you when you were ten? Yes, she ran off leaving Father and me behind. How did you feel then? I was disappointed and very angry. Why did she have to leave me? How do you feel about the victim and her family? I feel sorry for them. What will you do after you return to society? I'll work at my father's business and work towards something. That's all I have. Did you know the victim was pregnant? No, I didn't. - Did you know she was pregnant? - No, I didn't. A pack of lies. What the fuck? Cut it out. He's sorry. Thank you. - See you. - Come again. I cut up all her father's photos when I got divorced. So Ayako didn't know what he looked like. But now I regret not leaving any pictures of him. A hopeless man, but her father, after all. She should've known what he looked like. She did. She found the negative for this photo at my studio. She asked me to print another copy. I thought she wanted a childhood shot of herself. But that wasn't the case. So she did see him? I just can't do it. Remember the three of us used to skip stones? You were both so good at it. Tamio, why don't you re-open the studio? I can help out, like before. Ayako would be sad to see you like this. She'd be much happier if you were yourself again. Cherish her memories, then you won't be lonely. I envy her. You still love her deeply, even when she's gone. Let me try. Wow, that's great. I'll try again. Alright, get ready. Be perfectly still. Look here. A big smile. Fix her Kimono. Smile. Turn to the right, please. The right? That's too far. Like this? Hey, look over here! Good boy. Excuse me, you're Murase, aren't you? Mr. Tamio Murase? I'm Ihara, a magazine reporter. It's about your wife's case. This is the criminal who killed her. They called him Boy A, his name is Tatsuya Yamagishi. He lived in the next town. His father owns Yamagishi Motors. Expensive, imported cars. Even though he murdered her, he still doesn't acknowledge it. According to the police report, his first words were "When can I go home?" He was a dropout, but he will matriculate. He'll take college entrance exams next year. He's a murderer who will not admit to his crime. He'll be released very soon. An adult would get the death penalty. I can't allow that. I intend to write about him. I need you to tell me how you feel about your murdered wife and your unborn child. How dare you. Leave me alone. Get lost. I'm compiling a story about this boy, Yamagishi. I want an interview, if possible. Go get lost. Leave me alone. Stop it. That's enough. If you change your mind, call me here. Not bad at all, for you. Have some, Aunty. Please. My husband loved these pickles. - Did he? - He did. Not too green? No, I like them crunchy. He also preferred them like this. I wish he could share Mari's pickles with us. Listen, Tamio. Forget about Ayako. Find someone and be happy. I can't do that. It's been a year now. Only a year. No qualms. After all, a man needs a woman. How dare you say that? Ayako was stolen from me. How can I ever forget? If there is someone else, tell me. Of course there's no one. I talked to her, then we agreed to ask you first. That's ridiculous. Tamio has no special feelings for me. If he agreed, would you marry him? Answer me. You would, right? You can't stay single forever. I'm her brother, I know it's strange, but she would make a good wife. It's rare for him to get this drunk. He reckons that you'd make a good wife for me. He's a great guy, but... He's a big mouthed drunk. He reckons I'm insensitive not to notice you've loved me since we were kids. I had to laugh. He's so stupid. Exactly, he's stupid, and you're insensitive. If I can make it skip 3 times, take me out on our next day off. I blew it... Let's go out anyway. What is it? Nothing. I won't have the baby. How come? Because... Wait a minute. Do I mean nothing to you? I'll never be happy with any man. It's not just your decision. It concerns us both. Explain yourself. Come back. All families soon break up. - That's not true. - You don't understand. You were brought up in a happy family. I have no confidence. I never even knew my father. Lots of people don't, but they still lead happy lives. How can I be happy? I've never known happiness. You said it was better not knowing. Just wait. You said I have to find what's important. We can work this out. We'll be together. That's what I want. What do you want now? My investigation found out he had a deprived childhood. Abandoned by his mother. A brutal, violent father. Perhaps he saw your wife as a mother image. So he kills her? Give me a break. Of course not. Leave me alone. I don't need this. He's been released, you know. He served his time, so they let him go. He killed your wife and child. Don't you think it's too soon? He hasn't once expressed any regret for doing it. I'm concerned he might do it again. I've heard enough. Get lost. Just leave now. I'll be back. Don't bother. May I help you? Take a look around. I'll come back later. What's that for? Nothing. You're not planning anything foolish? Answer me. I just can't let it go. Her killer got out, he's living the good life. I can't forgive him. He deserves to die, or worse. Even if that happened, nothing would change. An eye for an eye, that's the only way. So you plan to take revenge? Her soul can't rest until I do. But that's exactly what he did. Kill him and his family will suffer like you have. He stole her future. But you have no right to take his. Don't be so stupid. You just don't understand, do you? No, you don't understand. Do you know what Ayako would say? Of course I do. Perfectly well. No, you don't! You don't know her feelings, nor mine. Be more constructive. Forget about revenge. Promise me you will. Please. Okay. I promise. You mean it? Looking for a car? I'll leave it to you. What's the mileage? I'll check it out. Just over 30,000km. Where's your toilet? That door there. It's an old model, but low mileage. It's a good buy. Want a test drive? No, maybe next time. Ayako's Landscapes Ayako's Wind Every single shot has an element of wind. She always shot the wind. My hometown, by the sea. A tiny little town. I had her in the hospital there. It was cold and stormy night. There was a big fire that night. I heard the sirens all night long. At the long, stormy night she was born. The town is known for the wind. She knew the place? Yes, we used to go back there once a year. Then my father went bankrupt, he just disappeared. I haven't been back for over 20 years. I wonder what she thought of me. I've struggled alone to make a living. I was sometimes cold to her. She never said anything. Once, when I broke up with a man, she pushed herself up against me while I was crying. She started crying with me. I was so glad that she did. She had a very kind heart. But the poor girl... ...she was so lonely. I was surprised when she said she was getting married. She was afraid of men. I never thought she'd marry. Thank you, Tamio. Her time was short, but she had you. That made her very happy. Forget about her murder. You have Mari now... ...concentrate on her. I'm sure that's what Ayako would want. She was like that. I remember her well. We called her Aya-chan. Her mother was beautiful, and she was very pretty, too. She was always out back, looking at the sea. I warned her it was dangerous. But she'd just laugh and stay there until it got dark. We found it here. Ayako's wind. Yes, I'm free, why? Just come tomorrow night. All the local guys will be there, It rarely happens. Yeah, sure. Mari, you come, too. Me, too? Yes, be sure to come. Okay. You think it'll work? I'm sure it will be fine. Don't worry. He's good at such things. It will all work out. After all, they do love each other. Really? But don't let on to Tamio and Mari. I won t. We take photos for the real estate agency. Do we have to? Sure, we need to find new avenues of business. There's no money in it. If we do a good job, it'll be steady work. It's not as if we're busy. Let's do it. Watch out! Here. Thanks. A fine looking gentleman. Yes, he passed away last year. Really? He wanted that for his funeral. He did it for his family, before he died. Did your father take it? He used to say the photographer was in every picture. What does it mean? His feelings reflect on every picture he takes. Like a mirror, he said. Not in body, but in spirit, he meant? Sit over there. Why? I'll take your photo. What's the occasion? Our wedding photo. With this hair? I like it that way. But... You look great. It'll make a great picture. Here we go. Can I take a look inside? Sure. Does the navigation system work? It just needs the key. Just give me a minute. There you are. Hey. What is it now? It's not working. No problem. Is this the place? Starring Tadanobu Asano Music Akiko Yano Conceived & Directed by Taro Hyugaji English Subtitles by Stuart J Walton (Sprout)
