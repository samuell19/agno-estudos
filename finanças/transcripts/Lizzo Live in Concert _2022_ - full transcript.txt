- Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... These are songs about love whether it's self-love, love for your family love for your friends or love for a significant other. I really believe that love for oneself and for others is what this world needs to be a better place. If you can just take the time to give a little love to yourself every single day treat yourself with respect treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated and then treat somebody else with that same level of respect? That expands. We're so grateful to have y'all part of this family. We are winners! - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... - Lizzo... Did you miss me? Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?

Everybody make some noise one more time for SZA! Now put your hands together... and make some noise for Cardi B Missy Elliott, and the Big Grrrls! My name is Lizzo. I love you, bitch. I love you. You are beautiful. You can do anything. Be kind to one another. But most importantly, be kind to yourself! Good night! Me coming to the show tonight and seeing, like what, 17,000 people here for someone that looks like me and they're here to praise her and love her? That is insane. The relationship between Lizzo and her fans is like the warmest hug I have ever experienced. Lizzo fights for us, like, always. She fights for us to be seen, she fights for us to be heard and she fights for us to feel loved. She came to me at a really, really dark time in my life. I needed her. I needed her. It feels like a big pep talk. Love yourself. Love the body that you're in. Love the body that we were given and just celebrate yourself. In case nobody told you today You're special You're still here? Thanks, babes. I guess you're waiting for this. Bye, bitch! Translator: IYUNO
