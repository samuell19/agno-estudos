That window from the third floor does not have lights on at night. It means that the room is unused. Watch reflection. You see her? Not quite, not exactly. We came for help. Do you have a light?

Let's see who gets first. Dam with money. You're skinny anyway. Are you ready? Yes. You should reach. Not a window, it's a goddamn mirror. We do not have to go around. Main guards are there.

A Dutchman who will have to take it with you. But we must find him first. After you, old man. It's better this way. But to sit with your back straight.

Gentlemen! End and pull out a knife. Put it back and inside is ... no, not out It should be a vial. Of course I used to ... I think the assistant's fault. Dinti.O paste squeeze and after a while becomes gray. The same color as the German uniforms. A tin of beans. An open and have ... damn. A false bottom, is a piece of silk inside. Perfect for hiding. Silk is a model very nice. It is actually a detailed map by Bavaria to the Swiss border. This man is a genius. You're an asshole. Lighten up old! You've demonstrated point of view. Not really, the other capat..vezi there beans. Just as written on the label The most practical and useful of evedare. And finally, from the British Museum ... a grand plan Colditz Castle.

Sometimes you do not remember what it looks like. Neobisnuit.Asa not happen, it should not be ashamed. But I feel so guilty. You have nothing to feel guilty. This is war and you have a life of your own. And if not I could be dead. You have to pay me for it. Oh no, oh yes. What? A dance with me. I have to think about it. A dance with me even if you have to crawl up there. I should go, it's late. You're somehow turn into a pumpkin. Lizy, asteapta.Te lead you back. No, I'll handle it. Let me get my purse. Approaching again. We should go to the shelter. It's very beautiful! How can you say that! People die there. You want me to win? I do not want us to win. I was nothing before all this started. We should go to the shelter. You all right? We must get out of here. What are you doing? Nick! We are in the midst of war Lizy. Come on! I may feel heart Lizy, that's how life is struggling inside you. Everything is blown. And suddenly it was all over. We're just us now. We can do whatever we want. We can be what we want. We have what we want. I want you! Not! Lizy! Tell us confirm his identity number. What's the commotion? Someone escaped from Colditz. Who? I do not know. Sherpshire royal infantry. Captain Edward Sawyer. Contact regiment and learn as much as you can about it. Who runs our shelter in Marseille? Mrs. M.Spune I will be a guest. Danziger is an American agent that I wanted to use it. If we can get him put it on the Baltic Sea in a boat to Sweden and take it from there. What do you think? Sounds good. Be happier man, this is the best news we have for several weeks now. I want you two to finish the job and ready to date. I think this is yours. It's just junk. Lizy. Lizy, look at me. Actually, I'm kinda busy. Not true. Last night was crazy. You could have killed us both. Was awesome. It was a mistake. There was no mistake, just know this thing. I made a promise. I love Jack. You can not wait forever. He might not return. You said something terrible. I'll be back. Look ... Lizy. Do not touch me please. I think you should leave. I want to go. I do not want to come back here. Lizy please! Lieutenant McGrade want to leave. Lizy please! Get out! Mary! Hi, how are you? Would you do me a favor?

So we can to hide in it the night before. Let's see out the window! Does it mind? We apologise. Shut up, man, we're busy here! And we are. See, turn left and then right tower. Did not you tired of this childish obsessions about escape? If you want to rot here that's your job. What you said? Return to your communist bullshit! Goddamn you! Come here! Look Mulon, it seems you do not want to understand is that we rot here. Escaped French, Dutch and Polish. Everyone laughs at us. Why can not you see that? Le Blanc, look at him. What he wants? I think pants world. Oh yes. Barnes. Here. Raise your hand! Or I'm flying out of here! What a gentleman! Hello. How are you? I heard a new escape plan on the guards. Correct. I fear that my people were planning the same escape. What a shame. It's just one thing we can do. Dam with money! I can not believe. I can not believe. I always luck. Data-goes or part! Another failed attempt. The more failed attempts the less chance for us to escape. Here I come again. Jill, get away from the window. I think we should go to the shelter. There will be leaving soon. Anyway, what's the point? Look, I know what happened to Jack's horrible but I have to move on. You have to go on. Otherwise even they win. So everyone tells me. You did it with Jack? You did it? Not. But have you kissed. You did anyone ever? Not. So you did any of the other? Which? You know. Lieutenant Nicholas McGrade. No, I did. But have you kissed. What is this. Not interested in you. I'll take that as a positive response. I think you should do with it. Think you've been keeping you very long for that special person. And suddenly bang. You inbolnavesti or die. And you do not grab it before. Never. ,, I call this tragic situation. '' I think this does not apply to you? That was close. Go to the shelter? It's a bit late now. But the lights were off. However, if it hits you and hits you over. Excuse me. Thank God you're all right. I learned that you were hit. Your face does not look too great. But it's not changed anything. I no longer feel my head, sir. It'll be all right girl. It was nice of you for coming. A boy to tell him to move his ass back here immediately. You know Jack? Yes. I wanted to come and see you. But I was not sure if you do not. Do not know what happened. From what I heard, he was shot while trying to escape. Is everything okay? I do not know anymore. I am sorry. He was a brave man and good. I would have never wanted to happen that. Know. I am sorry. Lizy ... I do not think I can live ... I know, I know. You know where to find me. Thank you. We can see as friends. Good.

These must be safe routes to France. We have several options available. Better work here, same thing. Not. This job is for you. Do you think you're doing? Yes, sir. Good. However, I fear that will not stick around for long. How so? Ti found as a replacement. Captain Sawyer, I suppose. Welcome to MI9. Good back? Oddish. They told me you're an artist. I was.

What bothered us the best was that I did not get to see you in a disguise of yours. It was a capadopera. Especially mustache that I had. I was sorry to hear what happened to Jack Rawles. Jack? Yes, I heard he was shot while trying to escape. You did not know? It was shot? I have not seen anything official but rumors. Yes, I'm sorry. It was Tom Willis him? Come on, Sawyer must know something. Is everything okay? Yes. Got a minute? Of course. Excuse me gentlemen. Rawles? Yes, it says he was shot while trying to escape. Of course, the man from Colditz. Benny was friends with him and wants to know if you have more details. To my knowledge, no. But you know his beloved Lizy? Yes a little. I thought maybe he heard something. From relatives or ... Do not mix her in this business! Of course. It's been through a lot. Jack's death broke his heart. I just tried to keep her away from all this. Make me look. I understand. Probably best to leave it as is. Dear Jack, if you're alive and reading this letter then I think you did a great injustice. For more than a year in London everyone here thought you were killed While trying to escape from Colditz. Recent events led me to do some investigation. According to your regiment you're dead. But then I went to the Swiss consulate where they kept files on prisoners of war. And they told me they did not know anything about your death. It could be a typo, but then I began to wonder who would benefit from your death. Which brings me to the most difficult part of this letter. Oh Jackie, I think I know of who is scisoarea it. That's not her handwriting. I did not written anything for months. Here comes Jack zombie. I need to talk to you. Only one minutes. Now! I gotta get out of here! You can not come and give me orders! Read this! Read it! I am sorry. What plans have you done? I'm afraid things have changed little during your deception. Really? Your request will be argued before the committee. What? All plans must be approved and scheduled in order. No time for that crap, Willis! It's my life here. You have to wait your turn. I can not! You wait your turn like everyone else, Lieutenant Rawles. Wait! Willis! I understand. Just tell me one thing. Who's next? Tell me please. I am. Mary, my daughter. I am sorry. My father. He grandee? Brigadier general. A war began last bottom. And stood up. Confusing story. That fathers. I am lucky in that regard. Mine was the seller. I remember everything. School games. Even when I was in scouts. I remember we put on me and my brother to raise the tent blindfolded. That was the best chance. The best! When I get out of here ... Tom Willis. Ian Norbeck. I'll help you contact them in English. And is a good man, volunteered to come here. You have the necessary documents? Yes. German Cata you know? At all. You need help in Liebtzieg. When you get to go to church Liebtzieg St. Augustine. You meet with an escort. I'll be talking to you on the train German. And take you to the shelter of Orso. How will you escape tomorrow? On the northeast corner. It's a small window. Down, go along the wall on the terrace and then through the woods. Success! Thank you. Willis. Something is up. Coming from the east wall. Jesus will Rawles! Run Jack! Faster! Run! Move! You succeed. You knew! Motherfucker! He stole my plan of escape. Motherfuckers! It was my last chance. Move out! Scumbag! Bagami-as. It's great news guys. You heard? They say it is someone from Colditz. You know who he is. Lieutenant Jack Rawles. Good news. Congratulations. You know where he is now? Currently we do not know. But we think is going to Leibtzeig where he expects Poles. Do you want me to do this? In fact I would like to me to handle this problem sir. I was also in Colditz and you know Jack Rawles. He helped me to get out of there. I owe. McGrade of any objections? No sir. Then let go to work. Willis? No, Jack Rawles.Willis not escaped. Change of plans. Come! I'm not safe here. Not! Stay away from the window. I'll be back soon. Met liaison. The place is full of Germans. They have to keep him there for a while. Sawyer! We have to talk. Is that so? E cam melodramatic, nu-i asa? Tell me what you know about Jack Rawles. You tell me McGrade. Do not get smart with me, motherfucker! Well, I tell you. I think you fell in love with his girlfriend. I do not know how or where, but I think he was loyal to. I think maybe you become desperate, I do not know. Maybe you panicked. I think I have faked his death so that you may have on it. Do you think so? Someone thought safe. You do not believe? What will you do? Nothing. This story is about me only. Once Rawles will return will be between you and him. I did what had to be done. What do you want to say? How come you did the right thing? You told him. However learn sooner or later. Who knows? Who you said. Nobody. It's between you and him. It is too late McGrade. What do you think, man. You hoped never to return again. Or you thought comes back, he sees his girlfriend and says, quite correctly buddy, you've faked death is not so well, but all is fair in love and war '. He was obsessed with this girl. I made her draw from his memory. He knew every inch of his face. How have hair that had her lips as if it smelled as he described. Shut up! Sawyer! Sawyer! It's not me. Come friend! Do you have a train to catch. Prisoners will be moved. Decision has been taken by the command. From now on Colditz Castle will host the only British and American prisoners. Prisoners will be moved to Stanislau Dutch and the French in Liebeq. This will happen as soon as possible. This is all. I told you I'd get you out of here. They remained tools, documents and a tunnel that have worked for over a year. What do you owe? Besides money? House wife, eldest daughter. The French should not bet. Are you feeling alright? It's just the flu. I get over. Meisner? Jesus, why did it take so ... It will be executed in a week. He left it. Not yet! I think we will fall to a different understanding.

But I do not know where to start. Jack! No no. I have to say a few things. We ... We were both young when they started all this. I still can not say I'm a grown man. Yes you are. Let's sit down a little. We both had to do some things. There were no rules. Now we must try to live again. What we had two was a dream. Know. I know all about dreams. My dream was a picture of you. And not for you. That's you now. And after everything that happened ... I still love you. I thought I will not see you again. Know. I understand. Umpteenth love I have in me I can give someone. I do not care how long it takes. Better go. Of course. However, I think I'd like to bring me flowers. What about tomorrow?
