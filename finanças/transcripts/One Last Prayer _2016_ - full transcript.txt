Get out, you are leaving tonight, get out. You gonna put me out of my own home. Stop it, Therron, stop it. Can I open one, daddy? Of course, Liv, it's your birthday, go for it. Hey, who is Ms. Willis? Isn't that your teacher, Liv? Ms. Tina. Oh, that's right, her last name is Willis. She got me the art set I wanted. This is the one I was talking about, see? Yeah. Nice, babe. Olivia, we can draw a poster for our dog walking company. Can I help? I'm a really good drawer. Okay. Where is this balloon delivery? Lex, did they call? Who? Party Palace, they should've been here. Oh, cute. They're here, they're here. Happy birthday, Olivia. Faith. Auntie Pat. Hey, birthday girl. Pat, hi. Hey. Ah, Patricia. Hey, David. How's my favorite teacher? Ah, jeez, don't remind me about work, this is a celebration not a therapy session. Get her going about Cleveland Public Schools, you won't hear the end of it. Good to see you, Will. Good to see you, too, bro. Children's Bedtime Prayers? My mom picked it out. She got it for me when I used to have bad dreams. There's a prayer for different situations, when you're afraid, when you're lonely, when you're sad. This is so nice, have you read all of them? Not all of them, some I read over and over again. Sometimes my mom reads them to. David, you look bad, are you okay? Alexis, are you taking care of your man? I know how to take care of my man, okay? Then what's the deal with these saggy bags? Look, I just haven't been getting a whole bunch of sleep, that's all. Yeah, it's been weeks. Insomnia, that's no good, can't keep on like that. Ah, tell me about it. Is it a boy or a girl? It's so pretty. It looks like a boy. What do you think, Hannah? Yep, it looks like a boy to me. What's his name? I'm gonna call him Henry. Henry? No, not Henry, Gabriel. Gabriel's a good name. Come on, let's go look at my dolls. Man, I don't believe this. What's up? I'm waiting on this delivery, balloons for the party. You should've used Party Palace, my good friend Frank is the owner. It was Party Palace. Oh, man, well, call him up, ask for Frank, mention my name, he'll take care of you. This is ridiculous. Conner? Excuse me. Long time. Yeah, yeah. Great to hear from you. All right. The balloon delivery is here. Hope they're giving us a refund. Just take the balloons, David, it's about Liv today, happy thoughts. What happened to the morning delivery? We had like 20 parties this morning. Well, I had one party and I ordered express delivery. So, do you want the balloons or not? I wanted the balloons six hours ago. The party's almost over. I'm sorry, sir, I've had a real tough morning, please don't make it worse, I just need a signature. What, what the... It's okay, David. We will be calling your manager. Fine, call him. Don't worry, bro, you'll get your money back. Yo, yo, what are you looking at, dude, that's my wife. Man, it's a little disrespectful... Hey, hey, hey. Yo, get 'em out of here, man. Call the number on the back for customer service. Yo, you need some help, I said get out. You're crazy, man, I'm calling the cops. He's gonna ruin this party. The party is not ruined, the kids are still having fun. Let me help you with that. He has been waking up in the middle of the night, he gets irritable all the time, I don't know what's wrong with him. I can tell he is not himself. He's definitely gonna ruin this party. Keep it together, Lex. Wanna talk about it? No. Okay. I'll call Frank myself. I'll text him now. But why did he just have to go off on somebody today, why? Listen, we can deal with this later. You know what time it is? Time for cake? Time for cake. Time for cake, girls, all right, come here, we're gonna cut the cake, come on. Come on. Call the boys in. David, Will, get in here, we're gonna sing Happy Birthday. Okay. You like it, baby? It's beautiful, mommy. Good. All right, let's sing &k Happy birthday to you &k Happy birthday to you &k Happy birthday, dear Olivia &k Happy birthday to you All right, sweetie, make a wish. Happy wishes. David, Liv, David. Call 911. Call 911. It's okay. It's okay. What is taking them so long? Well, you know how this goes, babe. It's been almost 30 minutes. I know. So, based on the CT scan, it looks as though we have a serious situation here. There's a growth in her brain tissue and that explains why she's been blacking out. Growth, you mean tumor? Like another tumor growing on her brain now? Yes. Brain cancer is that treatable, I mean is it curable? We're very concerned and need to do a biopsy as soon as possible. So, what you're telling us is that the treatments didn't work last time? No, they were successful. The cancer we treated before is in remission. But? Well, it's come back in a completely different area. So, what do we do now? She's not eating and she's been losing weight, what do we do? And she's been complaining about headaches lately. And she's been telling me she's been seeing spots. Those are not good signs. We'll give you a prescription that should help with the headaches. We have to go through this all over again, David. We feel that we can successfully treat this. So, what do you want us to do? Let's schedule the biopsy. Wait. What alternatives do we have? I don't know if I wanna put her through that treatment again. Let's do the biopsy and then we'll know what we're dealing with. This is a nightmare. We can't put her through this, not again, David, tell her. Let's just let the doctors do what they do, all right. We'll do whatever it takes to save our daughter. I understand your concerns, Alexis. I can refer you to a doctor who specializes in treating rare cancers. It's experimental, but there have been some amazing results. No promises, though. You may feel more comfortable going in that direction, but it would not be my first choice. I'll have Renee bring the information. Okay, thank you. We still wanna schedule the biopsy. In the meantime, try to keep her in a routine as much as possible. I'm so sorry you have to go through all this, she's such a sweet girl. I'm scared, David. You think I'm not? I do not want her to go through chemo again. It crushed her the first time. I mean, do you remember how long it took for her to recover from that? The side effects were horrible. Yeah, but it worked. I mean, we're not just gonna sit here and do nothing. I did not say do nothing. I wanna look into the alternative medicine. I can't even listen to this right now. Look, Liv, needs serious medical attention. You're just not thinking clearly. Listen, I am not trying to argue with you. I'm just telling you how I feel. Look, whatever I have to do for Liv, I'm gonna do it. Oh, you're gonna do it, huh? You're gonna do it all by yourself? You're not the one who's been with her when she's been throwing up in the middle of the night or when she falls over in the bathtub. Look, do you really have to make this about you and me? It is so hard to talk to you right now. Look, I'm stressed out just like you are. How many times I gotta tell 'em to put these toys away? Hey, watch it. You watch it and stop going through my trash. Trash. Stay out of my yard. &k Everybody's watching &k And I know they're waiting &k The pressure's hard for me to take &k I work too hard for me to break &k Sometimes I get fed up &k And I wanna give up &k But I keep on walking in the light &k 'Cause I know that everything will be all right &k Some days we don't know &k And those who come to the dark side &k But if we keep pressing on &k We know we gonna see the light &k Some day we don't know &k How we gonna make it through the hard times, &k But if we keep pressing on &k Everything will be all right &k What if I stumble &k What if I fall &k Would you come and comfort me Are you still not sleeping? What can I do for you, Tyler? What's the word on the Reed situation? We're just waiting for a contract to be faxed over. Good, that's a big one, don't blow it. Excuse me. David, this is major, we need this. Have I ever blown a deal? I mean, in all my years here, have you ever known me to mess up a deal or lose a client? Hey, take it easy. You know, I always thought my dad made a mistake hiring you, but lately, I've been seeing your performance and I'm starting to see the light. You were a diamond in the rough and this deal is gonna save our company, so I just wanna make sure that nothing's gonna go wrong. I know how to do my job, Tyler, that's why your father hired me. Just remember to log your delivery electronically. I know how to schedule. I didn't say you didn't know how, but last month, you entered the info wrong and if I wouldn't have found it, we could have lost a lot of money. You know what, you changed the info and didn't give us the new skews, that could've cost us the company. Listen, we can do this all day, but I'm busy, just make sure to have your skews this time. Hey, Lex. Hi, hey. Good to see you. Good to see you. I love this place. What d'you order? My usual, white mocha. So, how are things? Things are falling apart. I don't know if I can keep fighting with David about everything. I mean, lately, we can't agree on anything. I know this is hard on all of you, you have to keep that in perspective. David, handles it differently than you, but I know it's hurting him just the same. It's like deja vu. Cappuccino. I can't even imagine what you're going through, but I want you to know I'm here for you. She doesn't deserve this. My coworker's daughter went through this last year and they found this great program called Angel Wings. I got you an application, just take a look at it. You know it's hard enough to deal with Olivia's diagnosis, let alone navigating around David's attitude lately. I mean, I am so sick of it. I'm fed up, I can't do this, Pat. God is your strength, he's your shield, you have to trust in him. I mean, I'm getting no emotional support, so what am I supposed to do? You know what you have to do, Lex. Walk away? No. Well, then what? Because I really don't know. This is a season. It's going to pass. You'll see. You gotta keep it together, Lex. Don't you have someplace else to be? Yeah. Will you please pray with me before I go? Yeah. You should try to lay down and get some sleep. I can't sleep. Did the doctor call today? Yeah, I made an appointment for next Tuesday. You gonna take off work? Of course. You gonna come with us? Yeah, I'll be there. She is getting weaker, David. I know. I mean, it is coming all back to me like it was yesterday, with the hospital visits and the medicine. I hate the thought of Olivia having to go through this all over again. I know, she's been through so much already. You know, I called about the alternative medicine. It sounds incredible, David, I mean, the doctor was right, they have had some amazing results and I know it's really expensive, but I think that we... I just don't know about this, okay, I think we need to just let the doctors do what they do. Just look it over at least. It could save Liv from so many side effects. You've been talking about all these natural remedies and herbal medicines and everything, okay, now is just not the time to experiment, okay? We need to let the doctors do their job. Oh, man. Ow, shoot. Let me see. What are you gonna do about you not sleeping, David? Did Will call you yet? Yeah, he called. And? Well, he told me about some group or something, he called it a life group or something. I'm just not interested. Yeah, I mentioned that to you earlier. Pat invited me to hers and I thought it was nice. Babe, I'm just not interested in sitting around with a whole bunch of dudes I don't know. You know Will. Well, I'll call Will up and invite him to watch the game on Saturday. I just think it would help you talk to Will. Okay, I'm worried about you. I'll be fine. All right, then I'm worried about us then. I mean, you have to see what this is doing to us. Baby, it's just not the time. Well, when is a good time? I mean, you're not sleeping, you're irritable all the time and it's getting worse. You start drinking again and we're not even connecting. You know, what do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? I mean, I'm doing everything I can. I'm even going to your church. I want you to talk to someone about your anger. Now, you want me to see a psychiatrist, here we go with that. You hold your feelings in all the time and you let it build and build and you just explode. That happened once. No, it happens all the time. David, whatever it is you are going through, I'm here for you. You want me to go to a life group? Fine. I'll give Will a call back. I just want you to give it a chance, for me. For you. For us. For us. All right, now watch me do this. Corner pocket. - Oh! - Oh, man. Yeah, I could do this all night. Yeah, man. &k Girl, you're so cool &k So cool, yeah &k Girl, you're so cool. David Medford. Hoping you'd show up. Hey, you shoot pool? Little something. What's up, fellas? Hey, Brian. How you doing? Man, I'm good, man, David. Hey, Brian. Man, come here, man. You don't give regular handshakes around here, man? No, that's how we do it. Nah, man, it's good for you, man, good for your soul. Oh, yeah, okay. Hey, you memorize it yet? The verse? Not yet man, you? Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry, your anger can never make things right in God's sight. Look at you, man. Man, that's all right, bro, good job, man. Yeah, man, took me a week. Imma have it next time we get together. - All right. - Lemme get on this table. All right. Oh, man. Come on, Will, your shot, man. David, Fred Marks, what's up, man? Aw, no hug? No hug, bro. All right, welcome, David. All right, man. &k 'Cause she's got a vibe about her that's so fine &k And there is no doubt &k That we are two of a kind Want a drink? Sure. Hey, what can I get you guys tonight? Can I get a coke? Something dark and neat. Doesn't even matter what. Okay, be right back. Great bunch of guys. Y'all always meet like this? Sometimes we bowl, sometimes we hit the driving range, we mix it up. I was imagining something way different. Like what? Couple grumpy old dudes sitting at a table, man, with a big ol' bible with That was funny. I can't blame you, shoo, been to a couple of those groups before. No, we're pretty relaxed here, just a bunch of knuckleheads doing life together. What happened to your hand? Oh, man, just a little cut. Stitches? Yeah, a few, man, it ain't nothing. Hey, man. I know it's tough for you and Alexis with Olivia being sick. But I want you to know that I'm praying for you all. We're still trying to process it, man. It's just crazy, you know? Right. I mean, my daughter going through something like this, I would do anything to take her place, you know? 'Course I do. Bro, I'm so sorry that she going through this. Let me know if there's anything we could do to help. Thanks. No, I'm serious, anything we could do to help. Oh, man, yeah. Hey, how long y'all been meeting like this? How often do you meet with the guys? This is our third year. My main goal with the group is to let guys be guys. You know, no judgment. We study the bible, we do our best to live by it. I went to church a lot when I was a kid, we didn't have nothing like this, though. The biggest benefit of the group is accountability. Is that right? Yeah. We keep each other on track. Gut checks. Everybody's down with that? Yeah, that is your choice to grow or stay the same. Hey, Liv, breakfast is ready. Did you feed Gabriel last night? Yes, I did, come and eat. He looks starved, how much did you give him? Just come in here and eat your breakfast. What are we having? Oatmeal. Yuck. Come on, baby, you gotta eat your food. I hate oatmeal. What, since when, you love oatmeal, what are you talking about? It doesn't taste like anything. Hm, well, let's add some strawberries to it. Good morning, my beauties. Hey. Hey, daddy, I'm feeling better today. Oh, Liv, that's good, I'm glad to hear that. Hey, babe. - Hey. Hey, daddy, will you tell Liv that she needs to eat her oatmeal? She'll listen to you. Liv, eat your oatmeal. I don't like oatmeal. Well, what do you want? Pancakes. Well, let's get some pancakes. Pancakes it is, all right. Yes. - Hey, babe. - Yeah? We gotta pick up Liv's new prescription today, should help with her appetite. That's good. Babe, she's gotta start eating. I know. But she always ate like a little bird, my little Tweety Bird. Yeah, well, now she's eating even less. Let's get her what she wants, whatever she asks for. I just wanna see my baby doing cartwheels again. Do you wanna see the picture I drew for mommy? Yeah, of course, I do. You okay? I can get it for you. No, thanks, it's fine, I got it. Okay. Oh, that's very nice, Liv, look at that, that is really good. I see your mom there and... That's me and Gabriel. Okay. Well, yeah, no, I see that, I see that. I'm still working on yours. Okay, cool. What happened to your hand? Got into a fight with a toaster. Hey! Well, I gotta go, love ya. Hey! All right, Mr. Reed. Come on, let's make this money. Reed Construction, may I help you? Mr. Reed, please. May I ask who's calling? This is David Medford, Easy Electronics. One moment, please. Sure. David, my man. Mr. Reed, thanks for taking my call. Look, I'm headed out of town. I'm actually taking the wife up to Kelly's Island this week, but I figured I outta get back to you before I hit the road. Well, great, I'll get right to it. Well, it looks like we have all the items you inquired about, the Color Pro 3370, three of the Print Pro 5000s, and five of the Print Pro 2500s. Those 2500s are the smaller ones, right? That's right, they print up to 25 ISO in black, built in wireless and ethernet, 600 by 600dpi resolution. It's top of the line. Let's go with four of the Print Pro 5000s. Four, great, we can do that. That sounds great, so everything is available now, though, right? Of course, I can have it delivered as soon as next week, all we need is a purchase order or a check by phone. Excellent, excellent. David, you are a great salesman, I need a leader like you on my team. What would it take? Oh, I've been with the company for quite a while now, they treat me pretty well. Treating you pretty well. You gotta have thoughts of expanding your horizons, I mean, your company's a small fish in a big pond, but look, anyway, don't let me poison your mind, just fax or email over the final quote. I'll do it this afternoon and have a great trip. Thanks, we'll talk soon. All right, talk to you. Yes. Thank you, God. Did you close? Resending the quotes right now, he just ordered another 5000. Another Print Pro 5000, that's a huge commission, don't blow it. What can I do to help? I'll rewrite the agreement and I'll send it over with the quote, I'm good. Let me know when you close. Knock, knock. Conner. What's up, man? How you been, dude? Aw, man, good, good. Man, this is a nice office you got here, man. What are you doing down here, man? Doing some business in the area, I thought I would stop by and see what's up. You still in the same business? You know me? I got a little bar opening up in Cleveland, I have something-something going on Columbus with partners. You still with Chantelle? Chantelle, haven't seen her in five years, man. She took the kid and moved to Phoenix. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, man. I see you're still married. Yes, yeah, man, 10 years. 10 years, wow, dude, Mr. Family Man, Mr. Executive, salesman of the year, David D. Medford. You know, your grandma would be proud. Yeah, man, well, she raised us the best she could. Remember that time you stole that car and we hid it in her garage? Do I, man, that was the worst decision of my life, man. She kept asking me whose car was it, I was like, "That's my uncle's." You kept giving her those fake names. If she actually called the cops on us, you know we would've been in juvie for the rest of our juvie lives. Absolutely, man, I got whooped the worst that day of my life. That was probably the worst beating I ever had. Man, that was a long time ago. Good times. You happy with this? Yeah, man, you know, it's legit and I'm stable. But are you really happy with the money you're making right now? Yeah, man, we're doing well. That's cool, I see you, family man. I see you're going to church, too. What are you, following me? Dude, Alexis got all of your business on Facebook, talking about anniversaries, weddings, birthdays. Oh, speaking of birthdays, I saw Olivia got really big. She's huge now, she's like a big girl, how is she? They diagnosed her with brain cancer. I am so sorry, man, that's awful. Yeah, it's tough. Hold on a second. Hey, Lex. Hey, you got a minute? Yeah, what's wrong? So, Pat mentioned a nonprofit that offers grants for medical treatments for children. What's the name of the company? Well, the company's called Angel Wings and we would still have to apply for it, but it would cover the cost of the treatment that I want for Liv. I thought we were going with the doctor's plan on this, babe. You never heard me say that. Okay, let's talk about it when I get home. All right, love you. All right, I love you. Look, man, if it's a money problem, I can help you out, man. Oh, man, no, we're good. Just some things we gotta work through. Dude, if you need anything, like medical bills or anything, I got you. It's not a problem. No, I just signed the biggest contract of my career, dude, so I think we're gonna actually be okay, we're gonna be good. I mean, dude, you don't look good. I can help you guys out, it's literally no problem. It's just money. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right, but we're good. All right, anyway, man, it was nice seeing you, all right. Yeah, man, great seeing you, bro. - All right. - All right. All right. All right. What's the word on that deal, David? We're good, but what's going on? Oh, we're tightening up ship, we're scaling back on a lot of things. In fact, I need all of my salespeople to run reports this morning. This morning, I can have it to you by this afternoon, I'm a little swamped this morning. Well, I suggest you do what you have to do to get it to me this morning. You trying to fire me, Tyler? Can you just do what I asked? Well, how's the scaling back gonna affect the product line? I mean, I can't have my customers ordering things we don't carry. I won't beat around the bush, the company's in trouble. Our numbers have been really low for the past seven months and this is gonna come as no surprise to you, we're downsizing. Downsizing? Relax, you get to keep your job, but the rating staff is gonna have to agree to a 20% decrease in pay. 20%, how do you expect me to live off that? It's just until we get through the slump. We should be back on track within six months to a year. At least you get to keep your job. Well, what about this deal I got on the table? Yeah, when are you gonna close that, David? Tyler, I need this commission. I can't afford to lose 20%, I don't believe this. Listen, David, times are tight, everybody has to cut back and step up. Are you following me, David? Yeah. Yeah, we gotta cut back and step up. Now, if you wanna walk out that door, if that feels better for you, then go ahead, otherwise fall in. David Medford, Easy Electronics. David, it's Darren Reed from Reed Construction. Mr. Reed. Hey, look, is this a good time? Yes, it is, did you get the quote? What can I do for you? Yeah, look, we're gonna go in another direction. You want me to revise the original proposal? Nah, I mean like go with another company. Mr. Reed, is there something I can help you... David, you were a good salesman, look, you're a great salesman, good luck to you, okay? Mr. Reed. All right. The memory verse. James 1:19 through 20, anybody wanna say it? Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry, your anger can never make things right in God's sight. Great. The key to next level breakthrough is memory verse and the application. Well, Imma have mine next week. You're good. Anybody else wanna say anything before we finish up? Yeah, Will, you remember how I was telling you guys about my foreman at work who was feeling really depressed? Just the other day, I asked him if I could pray for him and he asked why I was going to church and I said, "It ain't about church." I said, "It's about accepting God's love, "turning from your sin, and following Jesus." So, we went back and forth a bit, but I think I made an impression. Amen, bro. Thanks. Thanks, amen. I got a confession. I lost my temper the other day with my wife again. I called her a B, man. Oh! She said I was a sorry excuse for a man and that I was weak. I lost it. Well, did you go back and make it right? I've been on the couch in the basement for the last two days. Sorry to hear that, bro. And she was wrong, I mean, the stuff she said was real disrespectful. Why I always gotta be the one to apologize? Yeah, yeah. It's rough. Let me talk to you some. Ephesians 5:25. Husbands love your wife just as Christ love the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy. I know the verse, Will. It's just hard, man. I gotta think about my kids. If I'm being truly honest, that's the reason I'm in it. I don't know what I'd do if I lost my kids. All right, guys, let's go over this memory verse over in Galatians 1. Everything's okay, bro? Yeah, man, I just needed a minute. I bought that at a auction in New York. I wasn't really into fine arts. Pat love angels, angel this, angel that. How was angels? Pat thinks that there are angels watching over us. I heard it so much that whenever I see a picture or figurine or anything, I get it for her. Does it help? Yeah, man, it helps. David. I know you've been going through a lot, but I want you to know that I've been praying for you. Pat and I been lifting you and the family up every night. I feel like I'm losing it, man. Hang in there, bro. Your family needs you especially now. Have you been praying? Man, praying is the hardest thing I could do right now. It's too hard for me, man. It's always the hardest thing, but it's the best option we have. Do you really believe angels are watching us, Will? Yeah, I do. Let me pray for you. Father God. Merciful and kind. I stand here as a man who life you changed with great power, I ask that you do the same for David. Show yourself to him. Do a miracle in his life, lord, heal his daughter. Heal Olivia, you can do it. I pray that you will give David and me the power through your spirit to control our anger and lead our families with authority and humility. We ask all these things in Jesus name, amen. I really felt that, Will. Yeah, man. Let me ask you something. Sure. Do you ever feel like God's not listening? He's always listening. Be strong, bro. Will you stay and watch the game with us? Yeah, I'll stay, man. Conner? David, my man. Hey, man, I saw you called. Yeah, man, you good, what's up, how's Olivia? She's a fighter, man, she's tough. Man, I know where she got that from. Well, look, if I can do anything, just let me know, okay? Well, Alexis was thinking we should try an alternative medicine and I was against it at first, but it looks like my insurance may be changing. Look, if you need cash, I got you, man. I'm not really sure what I'm asking, man. Check it, I love Olivia like she's my own flesh and blood. Just tell me what you need. Listen, man, you gotta leave that J-O-B and get with me, man, and make some real dollars, you don't have to worry about money. I'm serious, David, you still got rep on the street, I can set you back up, man. No, bro, I'm not interested. Not interested, I saw your office, I know what you're driving. Look, that's just not me anymore, all right. Oh, yeah, think about it, for your family. Hey, I gotta run. Yeah. 100. Hey. Hey. How was it? It was good. We had a good time. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm glad to hear that. Pat and Monica came over earlier. I forgot to pick up Liv's prescription, can you? Yeah, yeah. You all right? Baby, they cut my hours. What, what's going on? The numbers are down. They let a lot of people go and the rest of us have to take a pay cut. I mean, the company's in trouble. I don't even know how long I'll be employed. This is the worst timing ever. Tell me about it. You know, Pat organized a collection from the other ladies in our group and they gave us almost $300. Collection, baby, what you tell 'em? I mean, you know how I feel about having our business out there on the street? Patricia was just looking out for us. What, does Patricia think I can't take care of my family? I mean, is that what you think? David, listen to yourself. You can't be serious right now. No, I'm serious. I printed out an application for Angel Wings today, let's fill it out. Listen, baby, this is our wake up call, we should be praying. This is all happening at the same time, God. Did you hear what I said, David? Maybe God's trying to get your attention. Baby, I've been praying. I don't know what else you want me to do. If God really cares about us, I mean, if he cares about Liv, we just need some money. Money doesn't solve everything. It doesn't. Maybe it don't, but it'll solve something. Baby, I'm trying. I'm sorry, all right. Mommy, I'm cold. Okay, baby, let me tuck you in. Now, how's that, baby? It's fine. Daddy. Yeah? Would you ever put me in a nursing home? Liv, you're too young for a nursing home, why would you even ask me that? Faith said that when her grandmother got cancer, they had to put her in a nursing home. Oh, no, Liv, you don't have to worry about that. I'm not worried, do you wanna know why? Tell me. Auntie Pat wrote in my book. What book? My book of children's prayers. She gave it to me on my birthday. What did she write? Look in the inside cover. Okay. It says. If you say, "The Lord is my refuge," and make the most high your dwelling, no harm will ever take you and no disaster will come near your tent for he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. Psalm 91, 9, and 10. Love, Auntie Pat. I love the prayers in here. Yeah, you do? Yeah, they're really short like this one right here. A prayer for wisdom. Can I read this one? Oh, Liv, we gotta get to bed, but okay. A prayer for wisdom. Grant us wisdom in time of doubt to do the things we know we ought. Shine the light upon your way and help us walk from day to day. Renew our minds, so that we're clear to know if it's truly your voice we hear. That's good. I told you they were short. I'll read this one next. Liv, okay. Angels all around, when darkness falls on dreary night and the wind beats against my window, I rest assured that even then there are angels all around. When the fear of loneliness lingers and my heart begins to ache, I can rest assured that even then there are angels all around. It's love, your love that comforts me and nothing else compares. You are my shelter and I know you've placed the angels all around. See, it's just like the one Auntie Pat wrote in my book. I love this one, I believe it. You believe there are angels watching over us? Yes. Well, I think you're right, sweetie. Now, let's let the angels watch you sleep. Wait, I didn't read my favorite. Liv, it's way past your bedtime. One last prayer, daddy. Liv, you gotta get some rest. Please, daddy, one last prayer. All right, one last prayer. Yes, can you read this one? All right, a prayer for God's will. The grand design was set in place before the world began. Careful thought was given to every part, it was a perfect play. Though, pain and tears perfect my faith and brokenness to heal, yet confident in you, my lord, that you'll do your perfect will. That one's my favorite, that and the one about the angels. Yeah, that last one was nice, I like it. Daddy, does it hurt when you die? Not always, baby. How old do you think I'll be when I die? How does 150 sound? Daddy! Whoa, baby, you okay, baby? That's it, you gotta get some rest now. You gotta get some rest. I love you. Love you, too, daddy. Night. Goodnight, Liv. I gotta make something happen. We gotta finish filling out this application for Angel's Wings. You gotta sign in two places. I got a favor I could call in. Favor, from who? Fine, I'll fill it out and you just gotta sign, okay? Yeah, I said I'll handle it. And don't forget to pick up Liv's prescription while you're out. Well, tell her to call my lawyer because I'm not giving her a penny more. I don't care. After everything I've given her, she wants to do this. Yeah, you tell her to get the best lawyer she can afford, it won't be on my dime. Yeah, goodbye. She's a real beauty, ain't she? 60th birthday present to myself. Yeah, she's nice. Get in, check out the leather. That's okay. I'm not going to kidnap you, I promise, get in. You were checking it out. Get in. 306 horsepower, zero to 60 in 5.8 seconds. 19 inch wheels on this beauty. She's my pride and joy. Yeah, she's real nice, what year? Brand new, just got her, birthday present to myself. Well, happy birthday, man, happy belated birthday. You give great gifts. Peter. What was that? My name's Peter Popovich and thanks for the birthday wish. Don't mention it. Do you think I'm wrong? I'm just trying to protect what I built. I'm sorry, what? You know, what I was saying on the phone, you heard me, right? You know, my wife and soon to be ex, she always knows how to push my buttons. I just lose it, you know? I mean, you can't disrespect a man and then expect him to just roll over and take it? If you wanna divorce me, fine, but don't think you'll get another dime out of my money. It's a tough position to be in. Finally, somebody finally got it, thank you. I never should've married her. My sister told me, she's too young, she just wants your money, but that didn't matter to me. She's gorgeous and I was always a sucker for a pretty face. Should've listen. Yeah, she's a real piece of work, that one. Everybody could tell she was always trying to change me. Into what? Change you, into what? Whatever she wanted, that's what. Eat this, eat that, wear this, don't wear that. She even tried to pick out my friends for me. You know, I'm a grown man. David. I'm a grown man, David, I'm twice her age, you don't try to change a grown man. Hey, you're not having a heart attack, are you? David, how do you keep from losing it? What do you do, punch a brick wall or something? Is that why you're wearing a bandage? Funny you should ask. I've been going to this support group recently. Like AA or something. Me and my wife, we started going to this church and these groups. Like AA? Kind of. It's been helping me sort some things out and see some things in a different light. So, you found God? Actually, it's more like he found me. I'm still learning everything, but I'm thankful. Good for you, David. Hey, listen, it's been great talking to ya. Hey, David. Thanks for listening. Hey. Would you mind if I... Like can I pray for you? I'm not religious, but I wouldn't take offense to the gesture. Sure, what the hell? Father God. I know you're in the business of changing lives, you changed mine. I was angry and you gave me patience. I was prideful and you showed me my sin and my need for Jesus and I know you can do the same for my friend here and I pray that you would in Jesus name. Amen. Thanks. Thanks, David. There should be more nice guys like you in the world. All right, let us know if you guys need anything else and we'll pick up the pizza on our way back. Okay, you have some cash on you? Yeah, I'm good. I have a good woman, bro. You do, too. Yeah, she puts up with me. Still not getting much sleep? Not really. Have you seen a doctor about it? You know, they want me to do some sleep study, man, but I just haven't had time to schedule it. Well, you need to look into it, man, you're not looking good. I've been feeling better, though, since I went to that group meeting. I guess hearing the other guys talk about their lives, it made me feel like I wasn't the only with problems, it really helped. Yeah, that's why we do it, it helps all of us. Hey, how'd you become the leader? I don't know if Pat told you. I did eight years on a 25 year bid. Five years into my sentence, a chaplain came to the prison, just kept talking to me. He would ask me questions about my life, just listen, you know? After a while, he started telling me about this plan that God had for my life. I wouldn't try to hear any of it. Every time he would leave, he would ask me do I want him to pray for me. After about 50 times, I said yeah. And that moment changed my life. What were you in for, man? Attempted murder. Armed robbery. I was a lost cause. After eight, the court had mercy on me, got a favor honestly. Yeah, I was probably about seven or eight, probably about to turn eight. It was cold in the house. I always remember how cold the wood floor always was. My mother. She had just come home from work and as usual she was tired. She had just gotten paid. She was gonna use the money to buy me and my sister some school shoes. Man, she was so tired. She came home and fell asleep on the living room couch still in her work clothes. And my father came home drunk. Nothing new. He would get so wasted and then cuss everybody out in the house and he would beat us. He didn't even need a reason. This particular day, he came home drunk and started going through my mother's purse. He knew it was payday and he just wanted to use her money to go buy his drink. My mother woke up and let him have it. She started yelling and cussing, I'd never seen her like that. Me and my sister were doing homework in our room. I heard my mother yelling. I couldn't make out what she was saying. I don't know why, but I went and hid in her closet. That's when I heard her footsteps coming closer. My mother came in first. She was mad at him, throwing his stuff in the trash bag. I want you gone tonight. My father came in behind her, yelling and screaming, "This is my house." He grabbed her. What are you doing with my purse? Stop it, Therron, stop it. My mother was yelling for him to stop. All I could see was her feet. It was like they were dancing. My mother yelled to me and my sister. Stop it, David, call the police. Oh, man, all of the sudden, it was like an earthquake in our house, man. I saw my mother hit the floor. A black pistol fell out in front of the closet door. My mother's eyes were open and her lips were moving, I just couldn't make out what she was saying. I heard my dad yelling back at her. I just reached for the gun, it was closer than I thought. Don't you ever touch my mother or Sadie again. I don't know where or even if I hit him, but all I know is he fell back and he ran right out the house. We never saw him again. To this day, I don't know if that man is dead or alive. Wow. That's heavy. My mother never heard from him. She never said nothing, man, but I know she blamed me. I don't know why, as crazy as he was, she couldn't leave him. She still living? No, man, no, no, that's why we went to live with my grandmother and I actually had street cred after that, man. All the kids was saying, "Here's the kid crazy enough to kill his own dad." Who would ever thought we had that kinda history? God can change anybody. Yeah. Well, moving forward. Go ahead and start her up. You're good to go. Good job, my friend. Where'd you learn how to fix cars? We've been taking cars apart and putting 'em back together since we was kids, man, I know everything there is to know about cars. Well, everything for a reason. Well, I don't know if there's much reason to it, we just bad kids. How much do I owe you? Oh, man, it's all good. You've been out here for an hour and a half. No, man, really, don't worry about it. I mean, you've been helping me sort through my head. Well, iron sharpen iron. What's that? Well, basically, we look out for each other, make each other stronger. Iron sharpens iron, okay. Talk to me. Conner, hey, man, you got a sec? Always, what's up? I may need to take you up on that offer. My man, how much you need? Like five. 5,000. Look, it would just be a loan, all right, I'll owe you. Dude, don't worry about it, I got 10 for you, okay? It's no big deal, we're good, bro. How soon do you need it? Well, I was thinking sometime soon like this week. I got you. You know what, meet me at my girl's place tonight? Tonight, okay. Now, look, it's just a loan. I'll give it right back to you, I'm just in transition with my job. Dude, don't worry about it, get this address down. Hey, man, thanks, dude. You're a lifesaver, man. You know, a lot of people say that. See you soon, dude. Hey, baby. Hey, hey, I'm gonna be a little late tonight. Okay, I scheduled an appointment for a nurse to see Olivia at home, I'd like for you to be here to meet her. What time? 7:30. I don't know, I don't know if I can, I'll try, how's Olivia? She ate a little bit this afternoon. Just sleeping now. Okay, you give her the medicine? Yeah. It was really hard for her to get comfortable. She's probably sleeping now. Listen, babe, things are gonna turn around, okay Yeah, I hope so. All right, I love you. God. I'm desperate right now. You know I need this. Is this you? Just tell me if this is you. House rules. Ain't no need for that, bro. Well, well. Allison. Long time no see. Yeah, is Conner here. Of course, he's here. Well, you look good, haven't changed much. Except for that ring. Hi, Dane, chill out, man. What's up, David, how you doing, man, thanks for coming. Oh, I see you met my people here. Well, you know Allison, right? Anyway, this guy right here, me and him used to see some fire, man. I miss hanging out with you, man. You know, we could do work. If you come back, you'd be like royalty around here. No, I'm not interested, man. Allison, can you get this man his package, so he can be on his way? Family drama, they need 'em now. She's so slow, man. Want a drink? No. Well, more for me. Hey, Dane, so check this out, me and David over here go so far back, we were like 12, 13 years old, our teacher, right, Mr. Robinson was it? Yeah, Mr. Robinson taught us how to box and he thought he was my muscle, okay? We made some real money, though. Here you go, David. Hey, this stuff ain't cheap. What are these keys for? Oh, you and Dane are gonna go on a little adventure, I think. Oh, man, I knew I shouldn't have come here. Dude, it's not like that, man. You're out of your mind, man. It's a favor for favor, it's not a big deal, man. No, no, no, take this, take the keys, take your money, and find another errand boy. I told you, it's not like that, we're family. Come on, come on, David. You know it's funny how much has changed and how much is still the same, man, I came here thinking you would help me, now I see you're in no position to help me or anybody else. Oh, it's like that? That's right, I feel sorry for you, man. You come to my house, asking me for money, and you feel sorry for me. Apologize. Apologize to me for insulting me in front of my friends in my own house, then take the package, take the keys, and do what I tell you to do. That's it, we're still the same. I used to be like you, I'm so glad I'm not no more. I don't miss one minute of it. I know you miss that money, though? And I know your pretty wife and your pretty daughter are gonna miss that. Put the gun down, chill out, Dane. Chill out, put the gun down. It's all right, we just playin', we just playin', all right. Allison, towel. Towel. Conner, you stay away from me and you stay away from my family. Come on, David. David, we're family, right? Try me. Family. I was joking. I was joking, man. We're through? Okay, God. You got my attention, you got it. I don't know where else to turn. I don't have an answer for that. I don't know where to turn. Get away from my car, man, is that my bag? Is that my bag on you, yo? Give me bag. What are you doing? Give me my bag, man. Why you chasing me? That's not yo bag. Give me my bag, homie. That's not yo bag. Hey, give me my bag. That's not yo bag. What's this? Yeah. That's my bag. It's your daughter, right? What? I've seen you and your wife carrying your daughter in and out of the house. Is she sick? Yeah, man. Yeah, man. She got cancer? My wife had cancer, too, God rest her soul. I've been praying for your daughter and I'm gonna keep on praying. It ain't nothing. I ain't nobody. I'm gonna take my bag and go on about my way. David, what are you doing? Why'd you run off like that? Baby, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Baby, Conner, I went down there, I went downtown... Oh, the nurse is here. Mr. Medford. Hey, good to meet you. My wife will show you in, I gotta get cleaned up. Okay, hi, I'm Lynn Popovich. Hey, Alexis. Please, come in. Okay. Thank you. You have a beautiful home. Thank you. Please forgive me for dropping by unannounced, I have a flight to catch and I promised I would come here first. I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else, so you're not the nurse? No. No. No, your husband met my husband Peter a few days ago. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was? Lynn, Lynn Popovich. My husband and I, we were set to be divorced next week and long story short, your husband spoke to my husband and whatever he said changed him and it saved our marriage. Anyway, he made me promise to deliver this to your husband and I was really hoping to give it to him personally, but I can see that he was busy. Could you at least tell him that Peter and I said thank you? Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going. Peter and I, we're actually renewing our vows in Italy this weekend. I know. He's really extravagant. Thank you so much for your time. Of course, thank you. David! Yeah? Can you come open this letter? What letter? Here. Read it out loud. Dear David, I don't know where to begin, so I'll start at the end. My wife and I are back together. One clandestine evening while grocery shopping, I bumped into a man on a journey, little did he know that my plan was to kill myself to spite my wife. I procrastinated long enough to run into you, a complete stranger willing to listen to an old man ramble. We prayed for... Something happen. On my way home, something urged me to pull the car over and kneel in the grass. I repeated the words that you prayed for me, that God would change my life. I didn't know it at the time, but when I got up, I wasn't the same, God gave me a new heart. I had been afraid of not having control of my life and guess what, I'm not afraid anymore. I don't know why you listened to me that day and I wanted to call and thank you. I found your info on the paperwork that you must've dropped in my car. I'm on the board of several organizations. Angel Wings is one of them. If you send your application in, I'll push it through immediately. You'll find a thank you note attached. Trust me, what you did for me, I can never repay you. Sincerely, Peter Popovich. Is this real? Is this a check for $50,000? Wait a minute. Baby. Who does this? Oh my god. A check for $50,000. Who does this, who does this? God does. He answered, baby. When darkness falls on dreary night and the wind beats against my window, I rest assured that even then there are angels all around. When the fear of loneliness lingers and my heart begins to ache, I can rest assured that even then there are angels all around. It's love, your love that comforts me and nothing else compares. You are my shelter and I know you've placed the angels all around.
