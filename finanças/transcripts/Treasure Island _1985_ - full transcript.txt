No, it's not true. Morevover, it's impossible, ridiculous and stupid. Tell your friend that Mr Stevenson knows nothing about navigational practices. This book is riddled with errors and inaccuracies. You really want to know where the island is according to the book? Not far from Scotland. - Scotland? According to the info I could gather it's impossible to put a map up. What did he say? - He says there's more than one treasure. Really? Where? Let's search this treasure first. I find your theory fascinating but I simply don't believe it. That's all. I must confess that I don't like this trip at all. First, I hate to have a crew I don't know thrust upon me. Second, I don't like to have a boat thrust upon me either. Third, I don't like this boat at all. Fourth, I don't like the fact that cabins are all locked up and I don't have the keys to them. Fifth, I find it inexplicable that most of the crew doesn't speak French. Sixth, I find it unacceptable that most sailors have seasickness before we set sail. Seventh, I would like an explanation why an additional 30 tons of material were loaded at the last minute. Eight, I hate badly made packaging. And yours are sloppy. Some crates fell, by the way. Please, let me finish! Ninth, why all these weapons? Yes, I told "weapons". With a bazooka? You see nothing but I can see everything. Think over it. As for me, I made a decision: I'm resigning. I want my pay tripled or I stop right here right now. So, agreed? Well, sirs, I'm delighted. From now on, I want 50% more golden coins for my actions during the day et 100% more during the night. OK? I'm waiting here for an answer. Captain, we want a word with you. - A French, at last. Where're you from? We'll wait for you outside. We want a word with you. I hate Parisians (a notorious impatient tribe)! And I hate captains! I have to strike a deal with them. Be ready for tonight. So I heard you're staging a mutiny. I suppose it's not why you made me come. Oh, I see. Everyone's in the know. And what did the newspapers say? You know, I heard a lot of things from the other side too. So I think we can speak frankly. Like you I think that these gentlemen are not very clear. They hide things from me. I learned only yesterday that the island is not the one originally specified. Let's not even mention the money problem. They owe me two months' pay. The only thing I ask from you is to act within the law. Tomorrow at lunch I will speak to them but I won't prevent you from letting your men in and place them in strategic places. No, I'm not crying because of the onions. These three guys outside are our only support on this ship. Silver successfully bribed almost everyone. I heard he's a rather exceptional man. But, you see, I am wary of oily levantines. Crazy but not stupid. Quick! Quick! On this point, I'm not a typical product. I almost never read. I don't have time. Since I got married I think only about my debts. No, I don't know this book. About important things: I have to introduce myself first. I don't understand you at all! Now you owe me an explanation! My dear collegue, I had good reasons. This man has organized a mutiny in the 20th century! And he killed three sailors. So I demand that he be brought back to the first port and be handed over to the competent authorities. Before I forget: Congratulations, captain. You're a very brave man. Okay, okay. Upon arrival at the first port I promise you I'll buy a copy of... how do you say again? I think I got it. Benito Sereno, that's it? It seems to be a very good novel. Very interesting. And wages paid. I'm not interested. Good! Good! What you are doing? We're all in a hurry. It is essential that you tell us the truth. Otherwise, we will be forced to take extreme measures. Alright? Where is your camp? Again! I think the same. Interesting. Show me. If I may interrupt you, dear colleague, these are not general questions. On the contrary, they're questions of a specified order. No negotiations! So why do you want to negotiate? Okay, then. If you have something to say, the sooner, the better. Please, spare us your courtesies. Besides, I find it very cavalier of you to come here after all what happened. I believe neither in Scripture nor in destiny. All I see is a band of robbers who quarrel with a band of crazies. What can I do for you? What for? How can I believe you? What do you want in return? Sorry, I can't do that. Nor can I give you Timo. He's stupid but he's moving. And he owes me money anyway. Alright, I give you the Mexican. The girl and the Mexican. Alright! I give you the girl, Timo, the Mexican and the doctor. Sorry, I can't do that. I might've accepted a few years ago but now that I'm married with two children, I can't. I simply can't.
