[music playing] NARRATOR: [VOICEOVER]This is a personal story, the story of my life. I kindly ask you to keep it between you and me. [music playing] That is my grandfather. And this-- this is my firstvivid sexual experience. I didn't understand back then why-- why my classmates chased after me. Then growing up happened very fast. But I am sad. My words are going to be filledwith water, but I will not cry. My love for you is as strong asthe ancient walls of this city. NARRATOR: Nora is a poet. I know she is trying to tell me she is leaving, but poetry doesn't count. She kept telling me she feltme inside her all the time. I don't know how. We never did. Poetry-- I hate poetry. Nora was my first love. Today the doctor at the hospital told me a grant should be received from the United Nations to dothe operation on your legs. I don't get excited anymorewhen you talk about my legs and the operation. You talked about my legs and theUnited Nations for a long time now, so I figure I don't have to worry. If the United Nationscannot make peace on earth, surely they will not be able to fix my legs. NARRATOR: Let me tell you aboutmy father and his sad glory. It was a nice summer day. The occasion was pouring cementto make a roof to our home. I guess, even in those days,people needed rooftops. For my father, it was a glorious achievement. The custom specifically requiredthe neighbors and family to help pour the cement. The owner of the house, my father, had to treat everybody to a meal, an expression of gratitude. Ah, this is my mother carrying me around. Suddenly, bad luck struck. Look back. You see what I mean. That night, my mother gave birth to me. The same night, doctors toldmy father I had some kind of trouble in my legs. Since that night, my father felt guilty and was convinced that Godgot even with him through me. That is the true, sad glory of my father. Are you talking to yourself again? I can't keep a secret. Nora is leaving the country. I must leave too. Everybody's leaving. NARRATOR: A few years passed since Nora left. The intifada started, andlots of stones and bullets exchanged hands. Then the Gulf War began and ended. Many people died. Then peace came, and more people died. I survived through it all. Maybe fate thought I left already. The only way for youto get out of this misery is to go to heaven. I am guided by truth. It's the country of milk and honey where all people are equal. Canada is a country full of love and compassion. [music playing] The rich? Get richer-- The poor? Get poorer-- I have to be discreet, you understand. What if everybody knows? I understand. What if? [snapping] OK, come on. Let's go. Come on, come on. Let's go. [with heavy accent] A shipleaving Haifa Harbor-- A what? A ship-- a ship-- Ah, a ship. A ship leaving HaifaHarbor, loaded with tea-- tenth of the month-- do you understand? A ship sail directly to Boston-- from there, you hitch a ride to Canada. I must leave. You know. You understand. My life is going nowhere. But this is Jerusalem. JACOB: I am going to the new promised land. Be assured. JACOB'S FATHER: If it'struly the new promised land, you will be able to fix your legs. JACOB: Father, in a landwhere all people are equal, no one will notice my walk. Come on, come on. Up there-- up there-- Are you serious? Yeah, it will be fine. Everything OK. Bon voyage. Bye-- quiet now. OK, get out. The journey's over. [horn honking] Where to? Toronto-- Well, come on in. It was fixed. What else? If you want a lover, I'm yours-- no questions asked. I believe you. Why don't you do something about it? I don't want a lover. I want to be in love. Now you're too spiritual, Selma. It is the '90s. It is a new world order in the making. And look at you. You're frozen in the past. SELMA: I'll bring you more coffee. [music playing] Veranda lights-- that's the good one. Who is the guy youdropped at the intersection? He's a friendly, strange man. He is illegal, I guess. Why do you guess? The way he walks and acts-- [music playing] Don't worry. We just want to talk. Where are you from? The Old Holy Land-- Salam! Salam. Welcome. And, uh-- where are you heading to? Toronto-- Great, you are in Toronto. Welcome to Toronto. You need a place to stay? Welcome-- come in. It is not like back home but, as you can see, we made it as close as possible, still keeping some Canadianflavor here and there, wherever we can. I'm sure that our guest is tired. No-- no, not at all. You will have enough time to enjoy and see how good life is in Canada. Follow me. We will see you tomorrow. If you need anything, we willbe downstairs entertaining. Thank you. [door bell] It is quick, in and out. You must understand-- in and out, no hesitation, no what if or maybe-- in and out. [stairs creaking] Ah, this is Jacob, our new family member. I came down for some food. Sure. Who is he? Who is he? He said he is our guest. Why does he walk like that? He just does. Maybe he's an undercover cop. Maybe-- NARRATOR: Relax, it will be all right. Every beginning is not easy. When I was born, I was told I came out crying even though my mother was next to me. [dog barking] [snoring] [men laughing] Because you dance, huh? No? I didn't think so. [singing] [SINGING] Keep singing forever. How many times I asked you to go easy with the perfume you use? It's not perfume. It's aftershave lotion. [groan] Ah, Taxi-- Oh, Jacob, did you have a good one? Was it a good day? It is a wonderful life. I love the way people move. You can see black, yellow,and white side by side. It feels right. I guess I missed so much bynot being born in this country. Well, you seem to see more than we do. To see is something. To look is something else. So you don't look, you see? No, I look more than I see. Uh, Jacob-- sit down. Tell us about yourself. About myself? About my technique in seeing and looking? Yes, that. No-- not about that, please. That is quite clear to us. We want to get to know you. There is not much to sayabout my first many years. I was robbed blind. A gun was aimed at me all along. My parents were kind and poor-- kind enough to make 12 brothers and sisters, poor enough to feed us all. I walked funny, and peoplelaughed at me, especially when I was not looking. I was romantically involved. Fate forced me to let her go. I was unable to find work. It was impossible to be on my own. I lived with my parents and lived off them. I learned from nature and avoided poetry. Poetry? Poetry is too cruel to enjoy, especially when you live that enjoyment on a daily basis. Continuous turmoil in ourlives made a yo-yo of my hope. The people of the Holy Land made it unholy. Time was passing by. Through a connection, Ifound out that this country is the new promised land. I did my best to get here-- first time I eversucceed in doing my best. And here I am. So you are illegal in the country. Trust me. It doesn't bother me a bit. We will help you. Consider yourself among brothers. Yeah, you are among brothers. Wait in the car. We won't be long. [snaps fingers] [music playing] [beeping] [whistle] [whistle] [engine starting] [whistle] Stop! When I say stop, stop. [dogs barking] Go back. We have to rescue Jacob. Let's leave and save our skin. Big deal-- he's a misfit, anyways. You are turning into a thief without morals. Go back. [engine starting] Don't worry. You will be OK. This is our favorite place. We belong to this place. In a way, you are right. So what can I get you gents? Oh, Selma, meet Jacob, our savior and friend. Where are you from, Jacob? The Holy Land-- Wow, that's cool. So what can I get you? Let's start with three ice cold vodkas, double, straight up. After the vodka, we will improvise. I have been in love withSelma for a long time now. But I can't bring my lips totell her what my heart desires. What do you think about that? If what is in the heart did not reach silently to Selma's heart, there is no need for his lips to get involved. What? We drink this in one slug. To our newly found friend, cheers. Cheers. [gagging] [screeching] [sigh] [laughing] SHARIF: Bravo. That was cruel. Jacob, drink this. It will let everything come out. [vomiting] No, it's not fair toaccuse Jacob of anything. Selma and you are not meant to be. I was 12 years old, playingmarbles with my friends. I was a good shooter and never lost. A dear friend of mine turnedon me and called me Al-Afqa-- the freak. But there is no way in hellthat she could fall for him. You are changing sides. Two hours ago, you were ready to dump him. I was a coward. What a shame. Love humiliates pride. After that incident, I grewup without having friends. I like your walk. I think you can go a long distance with it in this country. Was she beautiful? She was the only reason for me to sleep. That's sweet. [SINGING] --long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go. Goodbye-- Oh! Oh! Oh-- [chuckling] They left me alone. I do not know how to get back to their house. They probably got drunk and forgot about you. Relax, I'll take you to their house. My win to-- to what pleasure I owe this visit. My handsome sheik-- This sounds like a condom commercial. I loved it. Wait. Jacob, please, walk beside me. There is no rush. Your house will be there whether we get there now or half an hour later. I think you have the cutest walk. Jacob, I was laughing with you, not at you. You have a gift. You can do many things with it. Really? [music playing] [SINGING] Lord-- sexy angel who's standing in front of my eyes, awoman take me by surprise. Yes, he moves so light. Don't hurry. Stay all night. We should make it so, sexy angel. Oh what a revelation! Oh what a celebration! What a revelation-- we all rise. Angels fly. Come with me Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Angel-- Let the music entice. Home, sweet home-- I hope I did not cause you too much trouble. A little-- NARRATOR: [VOICEOVER] Iwanted to know more about her, to look at her eyes, and tospend more time with her. The feeling I had when she kissed me-- but no, I had to be myself, a fool. Oh father, mother, brothers,and sisters, if you knew how much I miss you-- [snapping] Jacob, wake up. Jacob, you have to come with me. Have a shower and get dressed nicely. It's important. Let's go! Jacob, this is the only way-- the only way for you to stay in this country. I'm going to marry you to a friend's daughter. She is nice-- a little ugly, butvery self-conscious about it. So please be kind, hm? Jacob-- Jacob, it will be OK. Listen, listen-- personallyI am against the marriage. I do not believe in it, nordo I consider it healthy. But in your case, to become legal, you need to go through it. Understand? [knocking] [non-english speech] Welcome, Sharif. Welcome, welcome. Ah, this-- this is the lucky Jacob. My name is Jack. I am the father of Mona. Come this way. His Canadian name is Jack. It sounds good on him-- Jack Diaz. [laughing] Don't worry. It will be OK. Jacob, would you like a cigar, a cigarette? No, I do not smoke. That is good. Smoking is a bad habit and very expensive. I like this boy, Sharif. He is a good boy. You did a good job, my friend. Ah, this-- this is my beautiful daughter Mona. And that is the mother. So, Jacob, what do you do? Nothing-- Do not make jokes. We do not know each otherwell enough for jokes. What do you do? Nothing-- He means, now nothing. The guy just arrived in this country. Ah, so now I understand. So, what did you do in the old country, Jacob? Too much bloodshed-- I could not do much. I hate politics. Do not talk politics in this house. What do you do? I do nothing. What are you talking about?She does plenty. You do plenty. I do nothing. I'm not allowed to have friends. I sit around all day and watch soaps. Well, if you got married to Jacob, you will have lots to do. In the old days, that was correct. And it is still correct todayin this family, in this house. May I have an apple? Of course, have two apples. This is a good boy. He will make you a good husband, Mona. He is a handsome boy, a smart boy. Why do you walk like that? It is a birth defect. Why did you not tell me this? What? That he walks like a wounded camel-- Jack-- it's not going to work. Right, Jacob? Don't worry. This is not a good sample of married life. I feel liberated again. Mind you, for a time, I was dreaming of Nora. What if Nora and I were getting married? Sweet thought-- Sorry, I can't help you there. Suddenly a strange notioncame over my daydreaming. Instead of seeing Nora, I was seeing-- Who? [engine starting] [tires squealing] It's my night off, so I thought I'd take you out to see the city. It is kind of you to think of me at all. I know you thought of me, too. How did you know? I just know. My father always accusedme of thinking loud. Not this time around,you didn't think too loud. It was just-- What? Something like-- it was mystical. My parents divorced when I was six. They left me with my grandfather. I didn't have much of a childhood. I spent most of my time reading-- Socrates, Voltaire, Nietzsche, Rousseau. But I fell in love with thesadness of Kahlil Gibran. I'm going to share a secret with you. My grandfather got me the job at Paradise. It's a very unique bar. On Sunday nights, when it closed, it caters to a very specific clientele-- good dead people and goodpeople who are about to die. They meet there once a week to talk about life, before and after. Is this possible? It sounds like a biblical fairy tale. The back doors become a front entrance. You will not believe this. Priests, like bouncers, guard the doors. They needed a temple lady-- in our language, a bar person. A dead friend of my grandfatherrecommended me highly. The fact that I was atrue fan of Kahlil Gibran was a solid asset. I would like to go with you. I don't know if I can. Remember I talked to you about your special gift? My defect walk-- Yes, your defective walk. If you listen to me, you canmake money, earn a living. What do you suggest, sell my legs? I suggest you do a street act. I don't understand. Just trust me. - Jacob, we need your help!- Sure. Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way. Ja-- Jacob, come on. This is serious. Let's go. There you go. Get in the car. Come on! It's time you showed up, guys. He had a date. Not bad for a newcomer. Yeah. Jacob, listen to me. All what we want you to do iswalk in front of the building. If cops show up, you must tryto confuse them like last time, eh? Yeah-- Stavros will walk tothe front of the building. He'll show you a bell buzzer. In case cops show up, just ring the buzzer and disappear into the alleyway. Understand? Are you doing anything illegal? Look at it this way, my friend. You are illegal, and we aredoing something illegal. In algebra, that makes it positive. OK, it's a five minutes operation. Let's do it. Stavros, show him. [snap] Torch-- [music playing] This is Raj, driver number 666. Call the police. I am about to make my first citizen's arrest. Stay down there, you rat. WOMAN OVER RADIO: 78.5,code 6, 105 North Avenue-- Get me some cash. Make it a few grands. I'm going to get dressed. Your honor, this man iscertainly no threat to Canada. I assure you he will be accordedrefugee status in due process. And I intend to make him follow that process. Counselor, the problem I havewith your client is deep rooted and causes me frustrationwith his likes. This country is not for anyoneand everyone who decides to throw themselves on us. This country is for Canadians. Do you understand? I see your point of view. I think I do. But sir, as a Canadian to a Canadian, please show your compassion. Sharif told me what happened. He promised it will never happen again. I want you to come downstairs. They've gone out. We have the whole place to ourselves. I want to show yousomething very important. This guy walks like me. I said this guy walks like me. What is happening to this ugly world? Is nothing sacred anymore? Relax, Jacob. This is a movie. I thought, in your country, no one imitates a sick man's walk or abnormality. Sweet Jacob, he made this film in 1928, many years before you were born. In comedy, he's considered an original. And in real life I am considered a fake. He's an original. He's a phenomenon, truly accomplished artist. God gave you an asset you should use. I want you to watch this film. There is a segment we'lllearn and practice together. And then we take the act to the street. I'm worried I'm becoming a bit twisted. [music playing] [SINGING] There's somethingfamiliar about that walk, like a movie where nobody needed to talk. It tells a lot about the man. Everybody understands. He can dance with joy. He can shake the air. He can dance even if there's nobody there, but it's better when they are. 'Cause it's making him a star. And now that I've got your attention, there's something I would like you to do. Ladies and gentlemen, I give toyou, without further ado, Jacob and the pig. [squeal] Jacob and the Pig-- Jacob and the pig-- Jacob and the pig-- Jacob and the pig-- Now they're in showbiz this is going to be big. What shall we come them? Jacob and the pig-- Oh yeah-- I like it. George, this is fascinating. [SINGING] It's kind of catchy. Jacob and the pig-- [SINGING] Jacob and the pig-- Jacob and the pig-- Jacob and the pig-- Excuse me, darling, are you Selma? That's me. Well, dear, I really wouldlike to talk to you privately-- at your convenience, that is. Well, um-- I wouldn't mind doing it right now. Darling, yesterday I saw your act and thought it was quite interesting. You really did? Yes, I did. Thank you. Well you see, dear,tomorrow I have this function at the Honorable Justice Sinclair's residence, and I thought of including youract as a cute little surprise. Someone suggested a stripper, but I thought that a crude idea. Would you please accept my invitation? I'll pay you $1,000 for the performance. $1,000? Here is the address and a down payment. Ciao! How are you, darling? Never better. Mr. Stevens, how are you doing? Great, my dear. If I could light my cigar, I'll feel better. [music playing] Being with you is so different. You always have thisinnocent look on your face. At first I thought no way, not at your age. Children are supposed to have innocence, not men. But you do. No, I am not innocent. In my heart, I made anoath never to replace Nora. With you, I feel I have betrayed my oath. Yesterday, I rose at night andin darkness called your name. I adore you. [applause] [squealing] The next act has been receiving wide recognition and adulation. He has been called the real Canadian Chaplin. Please welcome Jacob and the pig. [applause] [laughter] MAN: I'll see your bet. [phone ringing] Plus five-- Oh, come on-- Now here we are. [inaudible] Two for me. - Two for you? Two for you? Two for you? [laughing] Hello? Hello! Guys, quiet-- an overseas call. Hello! No, no, Jacob is not here. He's out for the evening. You are his brother? Ah, number six-- what? [cheering] [applause] I'm Polkoff-- Polkoff, Inc-- are you his manager? Partly-- I'd like to put him ina commercial immediately. They pay great. Jacob, congratulations. Thank you. Please call tomorrow. What does this mean? The American dream-- fame and fortune. We have to talk. Sit down. Cops? Immigration police? Selma, I must do this. Please-- the men were kind enough to stay to support you in any possible way, though we know it's hardand there is not much to do, especially when you are far awayfrom home in a foreign land. My dear friend, I received acall from your brother number six. He wanted you to know thatyour father passed away. [crying] That was yesterday, and there will be tomorrow. In God's secrecy, there is a sort of virtue. We want to make a call to Jerusalem. My staff card-- it's urgent. Can't you make the call from your house? It's urgent! Jerusalem-- in what country? The Holy Land-- The only Jerusalem I'vegot is the one in Israel. Fine, that one will do. - I thought so. - Go inside. Dial 13. Good, it's our lucky number. It is not a lucky number. It is, and I refuse to argue with you. Anyway, after three minutes cut the call. If that's the case, pay first. You have the card. Charge it. [snap] Number-- [dialing] [phone ringing] My card, please-- thank you. [non-english speech] Is he all right? Oh yes, he is-- he's emotionally overboard. Otherwise, I guess, he is fine. May I? Thank you. Hello. Hi. You're here to see-- Mr. Polkoff-- And you are? Selma and Jacob-- Oh yeah, he's expecting you. Go right in. SELMA: Hello. Oh sit down, Please. Jacob, you don't have to stay in character. You can relax amongst us. That's his natural walk. Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry. He is an original. That should add a lot to our campaign. Danny, my assistant-- a man of great inspiration. Thank you, Puff, for your generous intro. OK, this is my proposal. You are going to be rich. And famous-- Yeah. You think so? To your success-- cheers. So, you're going to be rich and famous. Why did you choose your line of work? This-- this is life in North America. You're always chasing and never catching. It all boils down to money. Yeah. Yeah. If you have it, you can havewomen, food, justice, freedom. And if you are smart, even healthy-- I decided conscientiously toshy away from mainstream Canada. My aim is to make money and enjoy life. How I make money is my private religion. I sleep during the day, and I live at night. Whether I am in Canada or Jerusalem, nights are the same all over. But now we cannot use Jacob at all. He's become a recognized face. Rich and famous-- Yes. Have you seen Selma? Sure-- when you are alone, you look for her. [inaudible] No, I haven't seen her. She deserves me, not you. Idiot-- Selma left me, because shesaw my soul as lost in the fight for modesty and truth. How fast and easy I lost myself. I'll drink this bitterdrink, a kind of revenge. It is Sunday today, isn't it? Last time I counted,it was Wednesday, Friday. Sunday-- it is Sunday. Selma works tonight, doesn't she? It is a special night at Paradise. I used to follow her when Iwas trying to romance her. I was never able to get in. All week I can get in, still never on Sundays. How come? Weird, strong bouncers-- they don't scare me, strange people. Where are you going? I must move on. You are welcome to stay. But soon, Stavros andmyself are heading south. How far south? Not exactly south-- back home. I just want to check it out, you know, see how things are these days. I'm going back home, the tripelephants make when the lords begin to whisper their names. The Paradise Cafe, please-- [opera music] [heavy wind] [music playing] How did you get in? Actually, they were surprised to see me out. I'm very sorry. My behavior was not correct. Forgive me. I'm glad you're here. Tonight we serve only wine. Have a glass. [inaudible] Any famous dead people here tonight? Basically therequirement is good people. If you happen to be famous, it's OK too. Do you know who they are? No. SELMA: This is Jean-PaulSartre and Simone de Beauvoir. It's funny. Even in heaven, philosophershang out together. If you're lucky, it's Kahlil Gibran's night. He always shows up whenLeonard has a performance. Any alive people here tonight? You see this lady? Miriam-- she's a homeless crusader. Well, she has cancer and soon she'll, uh-- oh, there's Mr. Wilde. He donated all his fortune forthe sick children hospital. Supposedly he's going to be murdered soon, strangely enough by his11-year-old adopted child. Any alive or dead politicians? Politicians and a allowed in. This is Khalil Gibran, the prophet. He's very approachable. This is history. [music playing] [SINGING] Dance me to yourbeauty with a burning violin. Dance me through the [inaudible]'til I'm gathered safely in. Dance me to the end of love. Oh let me see your beautywhen the witnesses are gone. Let me feel your moving like they do in Babylon. Show me slowly what I only know the limits of. Oh, dance me to the end of love. Dance me to the end of love. Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin. Dance me through the [inaudible]'til I'm gathered safely in. Touch me with your naked hand. Touch me with your glove. Dance me to the end of love. Dance me to the end of love. [applause] Good evening, sir. I'd like to introduce you to my friend Jacob. He's from Jerusalem. Please join me. Jerusalem brings back warm thoughts. And candidly, as you probablyknow from my writings, Selma brings back strong and beautiful memories. I wish I can sit longer, butI've got to go back to work. Thank you, my dear. You have to earn money. I understand. Love is the only freedom in the world, because it so elevates the spirit that the laws of humanityand the phenomena of nature do not alter its course. This is beautiful and true. You are a troubled man. Very much so-- You do not belong to anybody? I cannot tell you much. But because of my fondness of Selma, I shall ignore the factthat you do not like poets. Thanks. Those who praise you andthose who blame you are equal. The strong and the weak aremade of the same elements. Your origin is their origin. Their conscience is like your conscience. The only difference is thesecret you carry with you which nobody knows but you. Since I am a poet and a philosopher, I can sense through your eyes that your secret has some sort of virtue. I might just change my opinion on poets. You make sure you do that. May I ask you a personal question? Go ahead. Actually, Selma wanted to know-- who is the real Selma inyour book "The Broken Wings"? Does it really matter? [laughing] [music playing] Jacob, what's wrong? I feel alone. I miss my father. I wish I saw him before he died. Oh honey, you're not alone. I have never been with a woman before. Wow, I'm your first. That's a milestone. NARRATOR: [VOICEOVER] Thiswoman has become my lover, friend, mother, and religion. Don't worry. It doesn't hurt. NARRATOR: I wonder-- was she the real reason I had to come all that distance? Was I born intentionally,with so many disadvantages, to seek a way out and find Selma? All these tombstones look the same. Maybe this one-- Father-- dear father, thistime I am thinking loud. I know you always blamedyourself for I was cast aside. Please blame yourself no more. Being different-- some call it talent-- brought me fame and fortune. At a time when I was about to find myself, I lost myself to thetemptation of immortality. Through the soul of a beautiful person, I am a free man. I know that, somewhere upthere, you worry about me. Well, I tell you, don't worry. I am OK. It is not like the one I grew in and around. Don't worry. I will do the most with my stay. Father, poets are not so bad after all. [music playing]
