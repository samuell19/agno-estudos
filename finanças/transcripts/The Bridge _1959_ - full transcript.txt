THE BRIDGE If they start bombing here - It won't come to that. It'll be over soon, Mrs. Bernhard. Let's hope so. They called my boy in for a physical. Sigi? They can't draft him now. Really? I'll bring your laundry back in five days. The shirts need a lot of work. - There's no hurry. - All right. Good-bye, Mrs. Bernhard. That was a bomb! The whole house shook. - Where did it hit? - Over by the river. - You weren't in the shelter? - With my horse? - Let me help you. - Thanks. I can manage. I know. You always manage by yourself. And all those foreign workers on your farm - aren't you scared? Sometimes, but I can't show my boy I'm afraid. Good morning. I'll bring your laundry by later. - I'll be home. Mrs. Borchert, Albert told me your boy volunteered. - Yes. And you let him? The Borcherts have always been officers. Thanks for the help. Don't mention it. Good-bye. - It was a big one. - Where did it come down? I heard it myself. Let's not lose our nerve. Just look at him! Is our local chapter leader leaving town? Ah, Mr. Rentor... think you're clever, huh? We make short work of those who undermine confidence in the Party. Remember that. Emma, hurry UP! I can't leave everything in a muddle. - You have the certificates? - I forgot them! What next! Mr. Forst, next time you cut down my trees, ask me first. No, ma'am. lt's all about the final victory. Don't forget that! - What was that about? - Mind your own business. - The certificates. - Finally! Get in. We have to go by the school. There's no time! You're lucky to get out. I have to say good-bye to our boy. The train leaves in 30 minutes. l'll explain to Walter. Let's go! Walter, pass it! Play by yourself, then. Hurry along, now. What are you two doing? Did you hear it come down? I hope one falls on this place someday. Right before math class. Let's send Churchill our schedule. Back to class, boys, or do you need a special invitation? Take it easy. Sometimes you get lucky. Only English left, and no field drills today. Franziska... you coming to the bridge later, where the bomb hit? Yes, after I go home first. - Mutz, know what I've got? - No. - You sure? - I swear. - Guess. - Just tell me. - Look. - Where'd you get that? In the air-raid shelter. - What you got there? - A mouse. I’m gonna let it go in class. - I bet you won't. Just wait and see. Very funny. You're such a jerk. The latest reports say Oberbach has been evacuated. Then they've moved south past us. - They passed us by. - They ought to call us up. Our babies - our hope for the future. - Lay off. - Shut up. The Americans have formed a wedge. But we could cut them off here. - I'd throw in a tank division. - You'd break up the line of battle. Would the general staff care to begin English class? Well, Mutz? I just had to move the front line. It's fun playing war, huh? You want to be an officer too? - He wants to drive trains. Really? I used to. Why not? We'll soon need more railroad engineers than soldiers. What do you mean by that, sir? When peace is declared, of course. Or do you have something against peace, Borchert? Of course not, sir. Let's continue with translation. Hager, begin. "If you don't like me -” Love me. "If you don't love me, let them - Let them find me. If I die through their hate... it would be better than if you didn't love me... for a whole lifetime.” Thank you for your efforts, Hager. And Franziska too, of course. Now let's hear how our Romantic poets translated this. Scholten, you enjoy this kind of thing. "I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, and but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.” “By whose direction found'st thou out this place?” “By love, that first did prompt me to inquire. He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot. Yet, wert thou as far as that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I would adventure for such merchandise.” “Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face. Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form. Fain, fain deny what I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'ay,' and I will take thy word. Yet if thou swear'st...” Forst, close the window. “...thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries, they say, Jove laughs.” Bernhard, close the window. Go on. Make room there. You can see I have a heavy bag! Give me a hand! What thoughtless behavior! All right, take care. What's the holdup? What are we waiting for? Stop crying. Be glad you're getting out. Walter! Take care of yourself, son! Good-bye! Nice work! What are you doing here? Why aren't you in school? I didn't even get to say good-bye. Just be glad your mother will be safe. - You wanted her out of the way. - How dare you! - Well, didn't you? - Mind your own business. Hi there. Sigi, you're here! You had me worried. Why? We were in the shelter. We missed our English class. English! What good is English to you now? Come on. Let's go eat. These things may start happening every day. I wish you could stay home. - What would I do here? What's for dinner? - Cabbage. - Again? - lt's all I have. - I want to go see the bridge. - Later. Come eat first. Sigi, come along! What are you doing? Wait. I have to feed Alberich first. How's it going? - Sigi, I wrote to Aunt Walli. - So? I asked if you could stay there a few weeks. You mean run away? What would the others say? - “Run away”? You're not a soldier. Wotan ate all his food again. You'd eat your fill at Aunt Walli's too. - What about you? - I could use your ration stamps. We can't get anything extra. L've bartered everything, and you need new soles. You can have Wotan, but you're not getting rid of me. - Hello, Karl. - Thank you, Miss Barbara. We closed for lunch already. This door always sticks! Allow me. That wasn't very smart. What's this? Give me that! What's this about, Karl? It's nothing. Nothing, really. I should hope not. Please forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. Go on, now. Your father's waiting to eat. - Hi, Dad. - Hello, son. Hungry? - I’m off again in a minute. - Where to? - I want to see the bomb crater. - Let's eat first. If there's a crater, it'll still be there after lunch. Thanks. Hold up your bowl. More? - No, thanks. - Good? - Great. What's Barbara doing downstairs? - She's still busy. - We're lucky to have her. - Very lucky. I'll go check on her. - Wash and set? - Yes, but I work till 6:00. - After that, then. - Good afternoon. Frau Weber can't come in until 6:00. My boss says you can't leave early for a haircut at the front either. Does he really? I wonder how he knows. He's exempted from service. Come after 6:00, then. Or do you have plans, Miss Barbara? - No, sir. - I'll see you then. Good-bye. Barbara, where did you - Miss Barbara, where are the soap coupons? In the cash box. Done already? When will you be home? We're going to work on the boat. See you. Work on the boat! Nice to have no worries. More likely he's going out with some girl. - I doubt that. - When I was 16 - But that was you! - Where did you get the cigarettes? - From Walter Forst. The local chapter leader's own supply. Want one? Not from him, thanks. What sort of boy is Walter? He's a great guy... but he's a sad case too. Why? He doesn't believe in anything anymore. And what do you believe in? Everything Dad told me. Dad always said to sit up straight and keep the reins tight and your fists vertical. But we had proper carriage horses then. That's not Chubby's fault, is it? Thank heavens you're back, ma'am. I was so worried. - No reason to worry. Vladimir, come here. Any mail for me? I didn't see any. Why isn't my draft notice here yet? They're waiting till you grow up. Meanwhile, give me a hand. I'll go see Major Saldern this afternoon. Children going to war! Tell her to stop her griping. You know she means well. Here's our soap ration. If you can call it soap. They're chopping down trees again. - I know. - They need wood for tank barriers. - Our wood? There's nothing I can do. I hope they'll at least leave us the pines. One or two trees won't matter now. If Dad were alive, he'd - You're right. I’m sorry. - Never mind. Unhitch the horse? - Sure. Come on, do a little work there! Do something! Come on, Chubby. Did I send enough wood for your boat? Yes, thanks. Enough for two! Enough of that noise, Albert. lt's unbearable. I’m almost done. - You can read with that noise? - I don't mind. Good news from home? Air raids all the time. Mother hardly leaves the shelter. She's very glad I'm here. So am I. Who else has two strong men around the house now? In fact, weren't you going to fix the blackout blinds? I will. Then do it. - Still no letter from Dad? - No. It's been 23 days. Mom, it doesn't mean anything. We'll get a stack of letters all at once. When there's an offensive, they hold the mail so no secrets leak out. You think? You see? It was nothing after all. - Just the wooden shack. - The bomb landed in the water. - Just the shock wave knocked it over. - Big deal! Stupid kids! You should be glad it was nothing. The old sourpuss is full of it. - Where did Sigi go? - I don't know. What? - Why's he up in our fort? - Everything all right? No special damages or losses! I’m going home. Us too. Right, Franziska? Fine with me. We'll be seeing you. Shall we go for a walk? If you have time. Oh, I have time. Do you? - Just a little. - Come on! What was wrong in English today? You knew the material yesterday. I knew it today too, but I can't recite that sentimental rubbish. “And but thou love me, let them find me here -” It does sound funny when you say it. I have to go to gym class. What time is it? Twenty-five past. Where's your watch? We bartered it for butter when Mother was sick. Here. A present. - You can't give me your watch! - Why not? You're crazy. Then l'll lend it to you. Why? So you'll have something of mine. - You'll tell me if you need it? - Of course. It has a luminous dial. Very practical in a blackout. Help me with this. - Ready? - Let's go. Wait a second. - What's wrong? - I'm riding on the rim. - Mom never puts air in the tires. - Give me your pump. - She got her pump stolen too. - Hold the bike. Listen, Hans... during the air raids - What about them? - Were you afraid? - l'll say! - You were chicken? - Of course. And you admit it, just like that? Why not? That's great. You done? - Yes. Let's see if Forst found some glue. Look, it's our midget. Glue and wood - our boat can float! - Was it hard to get? - No. Why? For someone to give you glue these days - No one gave it to me. It was just sitting around. “Wheels must roll for victory!” You're so mean! - Some hero you are! - I was testing his courage. - Picking on the weakest guy! - Hey, look! Someone hid something down here. - What's he got? - A fish trap. Must have been the Easter Bunny! - He doesn't bring booze. - How do you know it's booze? “Authentic German eggnog - 42%.” - Top-shelf eggnog! - So it was the Easter Bunny! You gonna just steal it? Whoever hid it here felt guilty. We'll be doing them a favor. Let's divide it up. How many bottles? One, two, three, four... Let's hide it in the pipe and come back after dark. - Sigi, crawl in. - Why always me? You're the smallest. - Just hurry up. - I am. Why should the others get any? We found it. - I found it! - Then you get two bottles. “Common good before self-interest,” Mr. Local Chapter Leader. - Tell that to your dad. - Watch it! Hurry up or we'll be late. - What about me? - Stay there, squirt. Come on. Faster! - We got booze for you. - I don't want booze! Pick it up. Where were you, Karl? - Is something wrong? - No. Then let's get to work. - Did you boys find some glue? - Right here, sir. - Must have been hard to get. - Sure was. Borchert... tell your mother the lumberyard sent the last boards, and that I send my thanks - Where's Borchert? Horber, get the wood. - He said to get the wood. Give me the screwdriver. - They're all sluts. - What did you say? - Women are all sluts. - You're crazy. Franziska too! Try saying that again! - Think we'll finish in three weeks? - The Americans may be here by then. Hitler Youth defended the Oberwald station for two days. - And after that? - What? Just asking. What happened after that? Guys, look! My draft notice! We report tomorrow! - What? I went in person. Yours are probably waiting at home. - When do we report? - 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. And I already did the math homework! I hope we'll all be together. Private Walter requests permission to pass! - Will another class finish our boat? - Our boat? We'll finish it when we get back. As a battleship! The tools, sir. I'll straighten up here. Let's all go home now. Albert, hop on. - You have to tell your parents. - I'll write. I'll try calling. Come on. lt's late. We have to hurry. Did you put everything away? Good-bye, then. What are you doing there? Get up here, and make it snappy. Give me that bottle. Liquor, right? - I don't know. You got more of this stuff? - Not me. And the others? Where did you boys steal this from? We found it! Come along. Misappropriating found goods: three years in prison. But I'm going in the army tomorrow. What? My draft notice is at home. It's true. Do I have to come to the station? No, we'll go see your mother first, so she can dry you off. What happened? I just Slipped, Did my draft notice come? - Yes. - Where is it? He can't be a soldier. He's just a child. - I'm not a child! Just look at you! You're soaking wet! Get out of those wet things, or tomorrow you'll be in bed with a cold. Impossible! I report tomorrow morning. Mr. Wollschläger... there must be some mistake! You must know that. They're drafting everyone these days. Then I'm sending you away. Sit down. I’m sending you to Aunt Walli's. You can hide there. - I'm not a deserter! Mr. Wollschläger... what should I do? Ma'am, I don't think there's anything you can do. As for the liquor, l'll overlook it this time. Where did you get that? You can barter it, and Wotan too. Thank you. The boys stashed it by the river. That's punishable by law. Then put Sigi in jail until it's all over. Or else l'll - - Mother! This is madness! I can't comment on that. I'm on duty. You have to understand. - Mother? - Yes? You still have that little suitcase? May I borrow it? Then you'll go to Aunt Walli's? It would look silly to take a cardboard box to the barracks. Yes, that would look silly. - Son, you're finally home. - What about it? Some mail came for you. Your draft notice. Karl, it shouldn't be that bad at this point. You'll have months of basic training, and by then - You two will be rid of me. - What's that? - I saw you - Get out! What do you want? I never want to see you here again! Get out! I never want to see you again! Have you gone mad? Barbara, leave us alone for a minute. What's going on? You're happy I'm leaving! You two can be alone! I don't know why you're behaving this way. After all, when two adults like Barbara and I - You're fond of Barbara too. Wouldn't it be nice if she stayed here for good? Stop packing for a minute! That can wait till tomorrow. Very well. We can talk when you come to your senses. I'd like to know what got into him. - He's just a child. - Exactly. I thought he'd have more sense by now. And they send these kids to war! They belong in kindergarten, not in barracks! That's right - kindergarten! Don't forget to have the tractor checked. Don't worry, Jürgen. I'll take care of everything. Ma 'am! The foreign workers have run off! - What? What do we do now? We should inform the police - No. I don't want those people here on Jürgen's last night. But the laws are so strict. When the Lettmanns failed to report the two who ran away - I know. l'll take care of it. Tomorrow morning. Trude, would you leave us now? How will you manage without them? - They'll send others. - But these just learned the routine. Who knows who they'll send now? - What can I do? - It's all gotten a bit strange. - You can say that again. And just when I have to leave! Jürgen, you know me. I can look out for myself when I have to. That's Dad's pistol! That's right. They sent it back to me. Mom, may I have it? Take it with you. Thanks, Mom. You have no idea how happy you've made me. Dad taught me to shoot with this. Officer cadets are allowed to carry a weapon. - When are you getting up? - Aren't we having breakfast together? Of course. I'll leave word to wake us at 5:30. Good night, Mom. Good night, son. You're amazing. You never lose your composure. Don't pack too much. It has to fit in a knapsack. Here's your sweater. - Put it there. Why the knife? - I’m bringing it. - This isn't cowboys and Indians! Our unit leader said you don't shoot at night. You use knives. Nonsense. He's read too much trash. Hans, you still have to write home. Here are some socks. - They'll issue us socks. You'll need some to change into. "In the heat of battle, the warriors changed into fresh socks.” My mom has a funny idea of war! I don't even want to think about it. Look at this! You have to wear them until they're past mending? I believe those are mine. l'll mend them. - Do you mend them at home? - No. Mom, I need soap. There's a piece of curd soap in the kitchen cupboard. You can share it. - Thank you. Great! Curd soap! If I'd known, I'd have swiped it long ago. Mrs. Mutz. Yes, Hans? Thank you for letting me stay here. But Hans... then I must thank you too for being here. Why? Having you here has been so good for Albert and - You're so grown up already. If my mother heard that! There's no soap in the cupboard. Look in the bottom cabinet. Please, dear Hans, look out for him. I will. You never called me “dear Hans” before. I promise l'll look out for him. Take good care of yourself too, you hear? Funny to think of you all alone in class tomorrow. I don't find it funny at all. Post office No. 2. No, the mail car's coupled to the 12:17 passenger train now. Yes, it was changed. Paul, more problems with the 12:17. You're out so late. What will your parents say? They'll make a fuss. - Then shouldn't you go? - I don't care. Really? Will it be much longer? If there's an air raid in Berlin, we won't get through. Couldn't you find out? All right, l'll try. Let me have 314. Otto? What's the situation in the air? Thanks. The only raids right now are over Hannover-Braunschweig. We might be lucky. What time is it now? Look. lt's easy to tell with the luminous dial. Franziska? I want to ask you something. What? But don't be mad at me. Promise? You can ask me anything, Klaus. It's our last evening together. Can I have my watch back? The luminous dial will be important on night patrol. Post office No. 2 here. Is this Bremen? - Can I talk now? - Yes. Hello? Mother, are you there? What's that? No, I'm terrific! I’m being drafted tomorrow! - What do you want? - Did you get lost? My draft notice. Not at this hour. Can't you wait till tomorrow morning? He's afraid he'll miss the free beer when we win the war. Quiet! Turn it up. The bomber over Hannover- Braunschweig has turned east. An attack on Berlin is expected. That's what I like to hear. You're too early. We do things on schedule around here. I can't go home. Let him stay, Paul. All right. Go lie down. Here's a blanket. Thank you. Your father says to turn off the Negro music. It's bothering him. - Why? What's he doing? - Packing. Tell him to turn off that music! And bring my dark blue suit. There's still room. Where's my - Going on vacation? Walter, I have to - I got a call from the district leadership. Where are my cigars? Nothing's ever in its place around here. I have to attend an urgent briefing. In your dark blue suit? It's none of your business. Give me that. - I’m going in the army tomorrow. - I know. While our chapter leader cuts out! “For the Fuhrer, the People, and the Fatherland!” Are you taking Miss Mählmann? - What? From the finance office. - Shut up! - The whole town knows it! You sent Mother away so you could run off with that bitch! - Have you been drinking? - Yes, your booze! Special rations for Party leaders on the home front! You should be ashamed. When we meet again after the war - You'll never see me again, trust me! Just you wait. They'll give you hell tomorrow. They'll kick your sorry ass. It's time you learned some discipline! Snotty brat! They'll make a man of you! A man like you? Did you sleep with my old man too? Did you? Your father was much nicer than you. - First squad! - Attention! On your feet! Forward! Think you can make soldiers out of these squirts? No. Take cover! Tails down if you don't want to get hit! Head down! Don't throw your rifle in the mud! You might want to shoot with it! Entire squad, retreat! Take cover! No need to drill “retreat.” They do that on their own. What's the point of all this? - Ask them upstairs. That was so much fun, let's do it again! Down! L've just about had it. Up and forward! Down! Retreat! Go! Attention! Forgive me. War involves a lot of red tape. Please have a seat. - Thank you. See that we're not disturbed. What brings you here? The boys from my last class are in your company. Yes, I know. Mr. Fröhlich, I- I come to you as a colleague. You're a teacher too. L've been a soldier for five years now. You were exempted? - Yes. My heart. What do you teach? English, history, German. I assume you've come to talk about your boys. Yes. I wanted to ask you - I can't see these boys sacrificed so pointlessly this late in the war. L've spoken with your boys. They're idealists. They believe they're fighting for an ideal. They want to save the fatherland. They believe in what you've taught them. Hölderlin! “The battle is ours! Live on high, 0 Fatherland. Count not the dead! Not one too many is fallen!” But all these ideals - freedom, fatherland, heroic death - have been hijacked by frauds! They're not true anymore! I learned a few days ago that my son died in battle. What's not true anymore? Forgive me. I don't think I can go on teaching with a clear conscience after the war. Mr. Fröhlich... I really came... to ask you to do something for my boys. Like what? Perhaps you could keep them out of battle. Don't talk nonsense! I can't listen to this! I have my orders, and I must obey. Captain. Is it clean now? - There's still dirt in the muzzle. - I don't see anything. Worn out, squirt? I feel sick. I can't take any more. Give me your rifle. We'll do it for you. We'd be in biology class now. I'd feel just as sick there. The bayonet too? It's a weapon, isn't it? Or you think it's a toothpick? Why isn't it sharp? - So it makes a bigger hole. - What? If it were sharp as a knife, it'd go straight in and out. Whoever gets this in the belly is finished. - In the belly? - Where else? You have to step on him to pull it out. - How do you know? - I read it. - Not like flirting with girls, is it? - Shut your trap! Attention! Third Squad cleaning weapons, sir. No jumping to attention when cleaning weapons. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Carry on. You're all quite good at this already. We learned in cadet training, sir. Speak only when addressed. Yes, Sergeant. - So you want to be an officer? - Yes. Your rifle. Hold the damned thing still. Higher. They didn't teach you everything at your cadet whatchamacallit. Do it again. - Yes, sir. Come on. You must think oil is the one thing we still have plenty of. You're wasting national resources. What are you doing there, buddy? Private Bernhard cleaning weapons, sir. You're obviously not swiping apples. What's that thing for? You stick it in a man's belly, and then step on him to pull it out. “Shake before using” read the bottle of poison Uncle Hugo slit his throat with. Carry on. Alert! March out in combat uniform! Alert! March out in combat uniform! Move it! Alert! March out in combat uniform! They don't even let us sleep! You're not home in bed. I can't fasten this buckle. Attention! - How's it going in here? - All ready, sir. Then get out there! Get that belt straight. You got everything? Don't forget your brain bucket, kid. - My what, sir? Your helmet! Chop-chop! Go on! Move it, men! Someone forgot his popgun. Unbelievable. Move it! Come on! Situation: shitty. Zimmermann, a cigar. We build a new front line here. It has to hold up until tomorrow. You may smoke, gentlemen. The Americans reached this line this afternoon. Beehive calling. My orders are to move every man to the front who can carry a gun. Only the sick and wounded stay behind. Zimmermann. “Captain Fröhlich will lead the battalion on the march. Staff will follow in marching order, medical unit and supplies in the rear. Headquarters as of tomorrow morning: Kannstett. Eyes right! Fourth Company complete! Battalion, attention! Battalion reporting, Lieutenant Colonel! Eyes”. Right! Grenadier Battalion 463 in heavy marching order. - Thanks. At ease. - Eyes straight ahead! At ease! Soldiers! The Americans attacked yesterday on a broad front. As of now our battalion is part of the 336th Division. We march tonight. In this hour of truth I expect the experienced soldiers of my battalion to do their duty, as always. Be prepared to engage the enemy by early tomorrow morning. Every square foot of land we defend is part of the heart of our homeland, and whoever defends to the end even one square foot of German soil defends Germany. We know that the situation is damned serious, but we are soldiers, and whether we live or die, history will judge whether we did our duty. The younger soldiers facing combat for the first time must know that our battalion only goes forward and never back. Our battalion only knows “Battle, victory, or death.” I trust that our fatherland can count on you in this fateful hour. As on all our missions, our rallying cry is “Forward for the Fuhrer, the People, and the Fatherland!” Dismiss them. Zimmermann, a cigar. Company dismissed! Pick up your ammunition and supplies. The latest report, sir. Make sure there's enough brandy. lt's going to be a bloodbath. Where's my car? Go get it! What is it? I have seven recruits in my company, sir. So? Sixteen years old on average, and untrained. - When did they join? - This morning. They'll run at the first shot, and the rest will follow. Just what we need! Sergeant Zeissler! Zeissler! Where were you? We have to go. There's a little bridge outside town, sir. The Americans have a bridgehead further north. That bridge is to be blown up anyway. But it should be guarded. The boys could do that. Fine! Put them there! Yes, sir. They give me a piece of shit that always jams! - Sergeant Heilmann! - Coming! Forst, take command of your squad. Go down and get supplies. - Sergeant Heilmann! - Coming! Hurry UP! - We're last-minute cannon fodder. - At the first shot, I'm off. - Let me through. - Follow me, everyone! No combat, no unnecessary shooting. Understood? Yes, sir. How long have you been a soldier? - Seven years, sir. - And what have you learned? - To keep a low profile. - That's what I want now. The bridge is unimportant. It will be blown up. No pointless casualties, understood? Yes. Thank you. A little order here! Hold it. One can only. - What? - Put those two cans back! - I beg your pardon? Everything's rationed... until the mass graves. You can keep your rotten carcass meat! Pick those up! You can talk! Your fat ass is safe here! This is mutiny! Mark my words: l'll stick this out to the end just to bash your face in! I'll report you! I'll have you court-martialed! - Why, you - Zick! Stop holding things up. Stop this nonsense, soldier. Go on now. I didn't know this was a kindergarten. Grab your gear and get outside. Move it! Close it so none of my babies fall out. - Sergeant Heilmann! - Yes, sir! Third Squad, off the truck! Once the Third Squad is off, drive on. - Are we at the front already? - Don't be an idiot. But... that's our bridge! - What are we doing here? - Be glad, you idiots! Would you rather be where the shit's really boiling? What's the damn point? We could have stayed home! The Volkssturm militia has gone home. Good. You can do as you see fit. Keep your boys busy. And go make sure the demolition squad gets here in time. The bridge must be blown up at the right moment. - Yes, sir. - I'm counting on you. Yes, sir. - Dragging all this stuff around! - lt's no fun at all. Stop complaining and bring that gear. You think something could happen here, sir? Anything can happen anywhere these days. Just a bit further to drag that stuff. Then we'll settle in and get comfortable. They dropped us off a hell of a way back! Like at the movies, the best seats are in back. Set that gear down. Set the bazookas over there, carefully. First machine gun: Horber and Hager. On the right. Second MG, set up on the left. We know this bridge, sir. We know where the field of fire is. - You played trappers and Indians here? - Yes. That's our lookout up there. May I position myself there, sir? Sure. Climb up and keep careful watch. Yes, sir. Set up, I said. Get those machine guns ready. I better move to the front, sir. Nonsense. You're staying here. And put that thing down. Go help the others dig. What should I do, sir? Go stand guard on the bridge. Understood? And don't abandon your post. Standing guard is the most important job of all. Go on. What are you doing? I need ammunition up in the tree. Lucky there's no cannon. You'd drag it up there too. - Isn't that enough now? - You kidding? They're gonna blast us good. - They can't see us in this fog. - And when it clears? Third Squad, form a half circle! Listen up. You'd probably like hot coffee when it gets light. Yes, sir. I'll go and see to it. In the meantime the one in charge is... Scholten! Understood? - Yes, Sergeant. Oh, right. Take my rifle. - Yes, sir. And carry on as I told you. Coffee boy! He's a great officer. What would you know? He even left his rifle. - Excuse me, you got a light? - Yes. - Care for a smoke? - Sure. Get back. Halt. What did he want? - Why? - Tell us. - Nothing. Go on. Let's go! - What are you doing here? - Me? Yes, you. Your marching orders. - I don't have them. - What unit? Sergeant Heilmann, Third Company, Grenadier Battalion 463. What are you doing here? Show me your papers. Here. We're securing the bridge by the river. That bridge doesn't need securing. lt's to be blown up. Admit it: You're trying to desert. - What are you talking about? Come along to headquarters. We'll give you something to do. My squad is at the bridge. I can't leave them. Follow me! They're just kids! They've been soldiers for one day. I was ordered to look out for them. - By wandering around? - I’m looking for the demolition squad! - A likely story. Damned fool! Don't be so stubborn! Come to the bridge and see for yourself! Send kids to war and then abandon them! Are you out of your - Put that stupid thing away! Halt! Freeze! What was that? Sounded like gunfire. You see anything up there? No, nothing. Then come down. War should be illegal in this weather. - What's happened to Heilmann? - He'll be back. - I’m going to have a look. - You stay here. Yes, sir! - I hope he doesn't crap out on us. - He wouldn't! He wouldn't be the first to crap out. Your imagination's running away with you. Did you hear that? It was just a fish. - That makes ten rounds. - We'll never use all that. Listen. Artillery. But it's still far off. Everything ready over there? - Yes. Come on. Walter, can I have your flashlight? Afraid of the dark? Can't we eat something? Yes. Then let's eat. Cut some bread. Heilmann promised us coffee. - He's crapped out on us. - Nonsense. Can't you talk about something else? Sigi, why didn't you send him to your house? Your mother makes great coffee. I can't tell the sergeant what to do. Don't you have your own? Stop grumbling. You can have some of mine later. If my mother knew we were sitting here - This wurst is great. Here, for Sigi. - Can I eat on guard? - You're a growing boy! - Aren't you hungry, Karl? - No, I don't want any. - Food's not bad, huh? - Just a bit damp round here. No schnapps? Here comes the sergeant. You nuts? He goes off one way and comes back the other? What are you boys doing here? Having breakfast. Liverwurst? You planning to start a shootout here? We have our orders. This bridge is strategically important. - Go home, boys. - What? - Are you crazy? - This is idiocy. This whole place will be blown to bits. L've been through it, before I was evacuated. Go home! You're inciting us to desert! Weak nerves, huh? We're at war! We must secure this bridge! You have no idea what you're doing! You trying to be heroes? Get out of here. Don't be stupid. Beat it! You boys don't know what you're doing. Look at him run! Faster than the wind. Look at him run! These old guys are all cowards. I barely had my gun halfway out and off he went! Let's set up some tin cans. Great idea! Maybe he was right. You don't know what he's been through. Wait for orders to shoot! Ah, pipe down! We'll throw stones instead. Out of the line of fire! Listen! Trucks! Quick! Barricade the road! What's going on? What are you doing? What's that doing there? What the hell's going on? What moron blocked the road? Our own troops block our way now! Are you crazy? Clear the road! Get moving! - Yes, sir. We've gotta move on! All hell's breaking loose! - What's going on? - Don't ask stupid questions. Hop back on! Move it! Drive on! - Let's put the barricade back up. - Not yet. He said more were coming. I think we should just carry on. I’m going back to my post. What's wrong, Helmer? It's dead, Lieutenant. We'll have to walk. Goddamn it! Get your stuff out. We'll get a lift. Quick! We have to get out of here! Look! He has a - Watch out! Damned swine! Rifles out! Next one who doesn't stop gets it! What are you waiting for? Leave that old heap. Throw it in the water. Leave that stuff! We don't need it now! We have to get out of here! Out of the way! Amateur! He let it stall! Drive! You want to die here? You're on my foot! Watch it! - Why aren't we moving? - I don't know either. Why'd you stop on a bridge, you morons? Hurry UP! Pipe down. lt's your fault it stalled. It's getting light. We've got to go! Look at the little guy. Sonny, have some chocolate before they put you in a box yourself. Let's go! What did he mean, “before they put you in a box”? He was talking about a box of chocolates. Just be glad you got some chocolate. - He had an Iron Cross! - Was he deserting? He sure was in a hurry. Those bastards just run off! They should all be shot! Is there anyone left between us and the Americans? - Want to go home, huh? - Of course not. - Everyone else has. Maybe it's best. - What? - To go home. - Are you crazy? What are you saying? We're soldiers. We have orders to secure the bridge. We won't change anything by holding this little bridge. Whoever defends one square foot of German soil defends Germany! So who wants to throw in his weapons and go home? You? Why look at me? - You two? - No. I’m staying. - You? - Think I'd leave you alone? - You? - I'm not a coward. And you? Are you a coward? I’m staying. There we are, then. Everyone to their posts. I'll go up front with my bazookas. Watch out! Low-flying aircraft! That's miles away. They're only dangerous when they come right at you. Look! Flat as a pancake! Gonna lie there till final victory? Did you wet your pants? What would Mommy say if she saw you down there? Watch out! lt's coming back! Get down! Let's go for a walk, buddy. Come on, get up. Come here! Goddamn them! Those bastards! They got our Sigi! Come here, goddamn it! What's the matter? Those bastards. What should we do now? We have to tell his mother. Why Sigi? I'll show them! Give me a hand. What's that? Tank alert. Come on. Barricade the road. Damn it! lt's the tank spearhead. Go back! We'll let the tanks through and then blow up the bridge. Into the basement! Walter hit a tank! Fire! More ammo! The damn thing's stuck. Hurry! Walter's crazy! Cover him! Are you crazy? Get down! Those fools will get us all killed! If the idiots had let the Americans through, we'd have blown up the bridge by now. God, what's going on? Nothing. Just a few fireworks. My son's a soldier too. He was drafted yesterday. You think he's at the front already? Yesterday? He can't even salute yet. What would he do at the front? Get down! They've really got us in their sights. Did you shit your pants? I wish it were over! Are you only tough in front of the girls? I want out of here! I want to go home! Pull yourself together! Jürgen Are you crazy? Get out of here! There are Americans up there, and women and children in the basement. Leave or l'll yell! Are you crazy? Don't shoot! - Another one! Watch out! - Shoot him! What's he shouting? Kindergarten? l'll show you! Karl, shoot! Kill him! Kill him! Shoot! Kill him! Shoot him! Karl, I didn't mean to hit you. It was just because of Franziska. Hit me back, Karl! I didn't mean to hit you, really! Help! Cover me! He's going nuts. Help! Get down! - I killed him, Hans. - You've lost your mind! I killed him. I didn't mean to. Come, Karl. Klaus! I killed him! I killed him! Leave me alone! They're gone. - Albert! - lt's not so bad. Take your jacket off. l'll bandage you up. I'll help you. - They've gone for reinforcements. - You think so? Come on. We gotta get out of here. Walter! Come on. Detonators and explosives. Put the boxes down. We'll need a big charge. The cement's thick. - What are you doing here? - We're blowing this thing up. You put on quite a circus here. How many bit the dust? Now you expect medals, right? Run home now so your mommies can toast their heroes! That's not true! Bunch of boneheads! Be quiet! Shut up! It's not true! Get out of here! Take it easy, son. Put that thing down. Don't do anything stupid. We have our orders. Now move it! Get off this bridge - I had to do it. Swine! Murderers! Get out of here! Right now! Beat it! Hans! Hans, what's wrong? Come on. Let's go home, buddy. Come on. Please. THIS HAPPENED ON APRIL 27TH, 1945. IT WAS SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT IT WASN'T MENTIONED' IN ANY MILITARY COMMUNIQUE.
