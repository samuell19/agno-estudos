And we arrive at what's called the night zone. Downstairs, the reception. Upstairs, the intimate part. It's divided well. See the mosaics. Those old-style porcelain sinks... Even a bidet. Rare for France. The guest room... Small, but comfortable enough for a friend. ACTRESSES A nice balcony. Look! It seems alive, like an elephant! Don't shout. I've got an earache. Where does she want the piano? What? Not this floor! They're mistaken. - Did she decide where? - Yes, she's happy. You're on the wrong floor. Go downstairs. - You're making my ears buzz! - But they don't hear anything! Watch out! Look at that! Where are they going? The first floor! - First floor! - Take it down! Stop! I said stop! He asked for her phone number. He called her once. He was a bit ugly. I would have loved to marry a prince... It's no picnic. Apparently it's work. But I still would have liked it. I light candles. Going inside a church sometimes doesn't hurt. Just a hello to the Virgin Mary... Praying never hurt anyone. I don't need a church to pray. "Ask and you shall receive." So I ask. You should try it. Elevator, please! For him... What's his name again? Jean. But it's over. What did he say? In autumn in the mountains. But he didn't have the strength to climb a mountain. - What mountain? - Me. I'm the mountain. - Trickling out? - Go figure! Perfect for the living room. Nice and welcoming. Excuse me, just squeezing through! - Don't regret Dominique. - I just miss him. You shouldn't. I'll get your coat. - You left him. - We left each other. Tell me why. You had what you wanted and now you're crying. - You complain and cry. - Where are the taxis? And Arthur? There was also Julien, my favorite. You would have been happy with him. Yes, your life would have been different. You could still... - He's married with two children. - So what? Twins. Well, never mind. Go to him, sleep with him. We find out by sleeping with them. Madam's pure. She wants pure love. Where are you going? What's going on? Our Natalya Petrovna, finally! I'm late. You're forgiven. Consider this your home. We're pleased you're here. Let me present... Your husband, Arkady Sergeyitch Islayev. Your trusted friend and eventual lover, Mihail Alexandrovitch Rakitin. And your adopted daughter, Verotchka. The young student, your son's new tutor... handsome Alexey Nikolayevitch Beliayev. Maybe we should start by reading the adaptation. "You seem sad today." "Listen... "I want to tell you the truth. "Perhaps I shall wound you, "but I know you will be more hurt if I keep things from you. "This young student, "this Beliayev... made quite an impression on me." "I knew it!" - "Since when?" - "Yesterday." Marcelline... That's the music for the play. It's also the inner music of Natalya Petrovna. New Orleans jazz. As if the characters were... I didn't introduce you to my assistant Nathalie. Come here. The marvellous Nathalie. Marcelline. What are you doing here? I was curious. - Why are you here? - I wondered if you'd recognize me. We were in acting class together. A long time ago. With Marc and the others. - How funny. - Always up for the same roles. Camille, Nina, Elvire, Hermione... "Where am I? What am I doing? What else do I have to do?" Yeah, that's it. "Without a plan I run in the palace..." So how are you? "I know not whether I love or hate." I am... Somewhat invisible, but... - You don't act anymore? - I do! I just was! But I have to eat... I have a husband and children. Of course. How funny! It's been a while. Hello. I wanted to say hello. I was told you were here and that you'd be in place. May I sit down? Thank you. Here I have the right to be sad, weak, cruel, stupid, full of desire, full of shame! I'll make a princess of you. Because I love you. Because you're generous, dangerous... surprising. Because you give your whole life. You sacrifice your life, I can tell. Excuse me. Sorry, my taxi's waiting. Your carriage, Madam! Holy Virgin... Holy Virgin... Allow me to experience love. To give myself to him. And when I die, I'll look back and see meaningful days, a meaningful life. Holy Virgin... Give me a husband. And I would renounce... I would renounce fame and fortune. So what's the story? A woman falls in love with her son's tutor. What else? He's young. She's much older than him. She can't understand what's happening. She feels like a quenched rose. I see. When he's around, she feels like a little girl... Intimidated... She tries not to show him. But she's dying to let him know and to know how he feels. - So you like him a lot? - Yes. When did your periods stop? - Can I get dressed? - Yes, sorry. Do you have insomnia? Hot flushes? No, I'm often cold. I take baths. - That's good. - Really? Am I alright? Is everything OK? I checked your dosage. I'm going to prescribe some hormone therapy. Thank you. Female hormones. Your male hormones are increasing. Am I going to grow a beard? You need to hurry up. Pardon me? There's nothing to understand. The passing of time and Nature. I just want to make you aware. Weigh yourself before coming back in. Are you alright, Miss? Fine... I'm weighing myself. - Are you alright? - Fine, thank you. Let's walk around the set. And open a door. This isn't connected to any scene or anything. It's silly, but... I don't know which hand to use to open it. Are you right-handed or left-handed, Marcelline? Right-handed, I think. Truthfully, I don't know. Yes? Maybe I should accept not knowing. Not knowing what? Where does the door lead to? - To a corridor. - Which leads to? Natalya's room. Where she can finally be... Alone. And? I don't know. Dream! Dream... All alone. So open it. Relax! Look at me. I said relax. This is acting, not torture. I hurt my foot! Why not a saloon? It goes with the music. All I wanted to see was Natalya Petrovna open a door with her hand. Any news from the others? No. From whom? I don't know... Melanie. She quit acting. - Really, why? - It made her too fragile. She was put in a psychiatric hospital. She was on a lot of tranquilizers. She went back to her parents. She couldn't live alone. Like a little girl. Now she works in a church library. Serge quit, too. He became a chauffeur. - That was a long time ago. - It sure was. I haven't heard about the others. Except for Marc and Vincent, who I see on posters. Like you. And George! He had a serious depression. Lost all his teeth and now wears dentures! He's still with Marguerite. He lives in Montreuil. A nice house with a garden, children... - I still see Julien's mother. - Where do you live? - Ile Saint-Louis, and you? - Saint-Denis. Holy Mary, mother of God... I wished badly the other day. I'm sorry. I beg you... Fill me up. Give me a child. I know now. I understand. Holy Mary, full of grace, I'm alone and I'm out of time. Help me. And I renounce fame and fortune. Eric Michaud... He plays Beliayev. We went to the same conservatory. We already acted together. We know each other well. We did "Romeo and Juliet". In English. One day on stage, something happened. I really blacked out. I saw stars, I looked up... I leaned on a chair. I thought I was on a real balcony. I even felt cold at one moment. I really was waiting for someone with all my heart. And at the end of the monologue, I cried unexpectedly. I cried! So well that everyone loved me. Thanks to my tears. Even Eric. He found me so beautiful that he followed me and kissed me. - Since then, I can't. - Can't what? Cry... Cry on command. Do you cry real tears? Yes... We can try. You have three minutes to cry. One, two, three, go! I feel sad, but I can't let it out. Dry! "Monte Cristo sits up, gasping..." "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" I don't get it. I thought that Natalya was there on her divan... Her place. And that her hands were like scissors. Those scissors that she uses to cut roses from her garden. You cut in the air... everywhere. While reciting your text. I don't like cutting. Try it, try it. "Monte Cristo sits up, gasping..." "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" That's good. Very good. I don't like gardening. I can't relate! I assure you... Natalya... cuts, cuts, cuts! That's the scene. Yeah, but I'm not yet Natalya. Then who are you? I don't know... No one. Then be her! Let's move on. Try it! "Monte Cristo sits up, gasping..." "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" "Not at all!" "Why are we reading it then?" "Why? "This is why... "Because the other day a lady said to me: "You haven't read Monte Cristo? "Oh, you must read it. It's charming. "I didn't answer her at the time, "but now I can say that I've been reading it and I find nothing at all charming in it." "Well... if you have made up your mind..." "How lazy you are!" "I'm ready..." "While you've been away, we've engaged a new tutor." - "A Frenchman?" - "No. A Russian." "Is the Russian old?" "No... "young. "I like him. "He's thin, svelte, with joy in his eyes." What would I want? Arkady... You know, Arkady, there are moments in the life of a woman, even the happiest... Miss! - It's Wednesday. - Pardon me? It's Wednesday. Children only. Sorry. More. After my daughter was born... Since he died, since he can't speak up, I don't have the heart to betray him. - What's "tromper" in English? - To betray, I think. You're here? I didn't see you. Should we improvise? If you want to. Sorry... Whenever you want. You can be less formal. Do I seem so old? You told me a while ago that you couldn't sleep one night. That you didn't sleep at all. Why not? Were you worried? What were you thinking about? About life. About today, about tomorrow. Full of promise. You thought of yourself, no one else? That's how I'd like to stay... In your eyes, all my life. "Me? Madam?" "Look, if you want to walk..." "Why no, Madam. I've been outdoors all morning." "Well then. "In that case, sit down. Sit there! "We have not had a proper talk, Alexey Nikolayevitch. "We have not made friends yet. I want to get to know you." "That's very kind of you, Madam." "You are afraid of me, "I see. "But you won't be afraid of me when you know me. How old are you?" "Twenty-one, Madam." I must stop you right there. She's sometimes mad, sometimes mean or in heat. Yes, in heat sexually, but never sad. You were melancholic. - You were hunched over. - I tripped... Totally hunched over. The tutor's presence flustered me. I don't want flustered! I want the walk! Look for the walk and everything else will come! From the start, I've told you one thing: Stomach in. One two, one two! Go! Marc, Jean-Paul, the aristocrats, everyone! Juliette, too! Look for the walk and the rest will come! Go on! One two, one two! Go on, Marcelline! The big actress! What are you waiting for? To feel? I don't want feelings! I want bodies, not psychology! We'll do this all afternoon! "Chest out, stomach in!" I stood like a soldier. One two, one two... Denis! I can't come tomorrow. Yes, I know. You told me. No problem. But you can call me, if you want. For notes or anything... Alright. Thanks. Really, you can call me. Even late. Call me, if you want to. Your voice would be a heavenly gift to my ears. No one really notices me... I'm the husband. Islayev, the cuckold. I take care of the horses. I love my wife. Isn't that funny? I love her flaws... Her virtues, of course... but also her flaws. Perfect. It's the perfect silhouette for Act II. But I can't. Trust me. Why don't you trust me? I can't wear green. - It's not really green. - It's completely green! That's what's beautiful. Take it as a challenge. Overcome it. It's my body which refuses, not my mind. - I want you to. - But my body doesn't. Well, I do. Maybe I could dye it. I could try to dye it. Good idea. Just dye the dress. A little more blue or less green. I'd like that. But it would still be a green dress. It will always be a green dress. Originally, it's a green dress. And green brings bad luck on stage. - You signed a contract. - I do what I want. I'm crazy. I'll hire a lawyer. I'll say I'm crazy. Let me go. I made a mistake taking this role. That woman is too different from me. She's a fighter. Your direction makes no sense. You're all talk and no talent. Everything is so ridiculous. Find someone else. Let me go. No, don't leave. - Let me out. - You're staying. - I want out! - You're staying! You're staying! I want to live! You're stopping me from being alive! I don't want to. Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? I'll help you! What are you doing here? Just trying out my sofa. What are you doing here? How are you? OK, fine. You won't start crying? No, I won't. It's too sweet. And too bitter. I understand only half of your mumbling. Articulate! Look at me. You died without saying goodbye. Don't you realize? When I was little... Breakfast used to be so happy. Wipe your nose, dear. You're snivelling. I used to sit on your left at the dinner table. I ate what you ate. Before sleeping, I scratched my back like you. How's your love life? I didn't hear you. You take up too much space. It's a big sofa. I can't manage to get married. "On sleep, a phantom in the myrtle shade, "While you beside the fire, a grandame grey, My love, your pride, Remember and regret." To answer your first question: Why Turgenev? Because Turgenev needs me. Just kidding! Your second question: Why Marcelline Birovsky? Again, because... Her. That's all. That's all and nothing. It's indescribable, unspeakable. See the play tonight to understand. She's a walking sack of emotions. Don't close the door. I'm here. "Monte Cristo sits up, gasping..." "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" "Not at all!" "Why are we reading it then?" You came! You shouldn't have. It's silly! Sit on my little sofa. Do you want some vodka? You were stiff. What a pity! Like you were in a straightjacket. Like you never acted before, like you're elsewhere. That wasn't you! And your laugh? - Did you swallow it? - That's enough. Enough. You think and said the same thing. I'm a little deaf, you know. I have this ringing in my ears all the time. It never stops. Like sirens. I didn't hear anything. Beautiful costumes! Nice green dress, except for the color. The director. My mother and my aunt. His assistant. Isn't she marvellous? Marvellous! I should go. See you later. Excuse me... Excuse me, I'd like to speak to you about a scene. The garden scene in Act II. I'm taking a shower. I can't manage to laugh. You changed something. I don't know. You washed. Your feet don't stink anymore. Thanks. Now I can't manage to laugh. Even my mother... Your mother? I wanted to ask if you could find a way to make your feet stink again. I don't know... Maybe you could put on your old socks. Then Natalya Petrovna could be free, happy, joyous. I don't know! Bravo! Really, bravo. You're very beautiful. More beautiful on stage than in real life. I mean more beautiful in real life than on stage. Drop the shy act. You just look stupid. He's my husband. My little husband turns stupid because he's so impressed by you. Raymond. Marcelline. Raymond... the stupid. I like songs. I love music. I love singing. Then sing! I love a captain's daughter Who raises her hand to the sun Those aren't the words I can't remember anything I don't know why Love holds us together In dreams Julien... Julien... My love. Watch out. It's high. Don't worry. You were always afraid for me, but see? I'm Tarzan, I'm Zorro, I'm King Kong! Darling... Show me your breasts. Go on! It's been so long. And your ass. Show me your ass. Maybe someone else is here. Want some vodka? My darling! You know... When your mother called that Friday and said: "Julien is dead," I said no, so that it wouldn't be true. I put flowers for you at the cemetery. I know. You really could've stayed, been more careful. I could have. What were you thinking? Choosing to leave like that! Miss... - Do you know Murray Rose? - Pardon me? Do you know Murray Rose? Know why? He had music in his head. Glenn Miller's "In the Mood." He listened to it before meets. When he swam, it was in his head. Marcelline! The incomprehensions, the doubts, I'm happy. "Take off that hat. It bothers me." I'd like to talk to you. But inside I have a mad hope. I'm ready to wait. I love your face. I'm ready to change my life for one kiss from you. - You're crazy. - Say so and I'll shut up. - You have a husband, children. - I'll leave them. - I'll think about it. - What did you say? "A Frenchman?" "No, a Russian." "Is this Russian old?" "No... "young. We only have him for the summer." Arthur! You weren't in your dressing room. You came tonight? I was saying goodbye to my divan. Can I sit? Wait, I'll ask it. An old friend. No problem! It was good. No, it's not good. Remember Platonov? Yes, Sophia Egorovna, I remember. Then you went to dress, you left your dressing room your Platonov hat... You, in your polka-dot dress... I wanted you. Are you staying? Will you turn off the lights? The stagehand. Sorry, I can't see you. Garden side, OK. "No, I'm not afraid. I don't dream of being afraid." I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid anymore. I didn't know... I didn't know how soft your lips were. And yours, my love. All those years. Arthur... give me a child. I'm not afraid anymore. Marguerite didn't come? The twins have chickenpox. - Are they OK otherwise? - Very well. Our electricity was cut off. We're in darkness. Have I grown old? You look great. "Really? "Take a seat. "Here, please. "We have not had a proper talk, Alexey Nikolayevitch. "We have not Mrs Vibier... Excuse me... I haven't had my period, despite the hormones. Not yet? - Do you have a father? - My father died. No, a man for the child. "I love you." "Yes, me. "I love you. "I loved you "the day you arrived. But I realized it only yesterday." Is it too late to order? Sorry? - I thought you were speaking to me. - I said nothing. Excuse me... Excuse me, can I order something to eat? No one answers me tonight. Everyone's deaf. I'm like a fish in a bowl. Excuse me! He doesn't see me. People work. You're not the centre of the world. What? Excuse me... If you'd look around, you'd see that... - See what? - That it's you who can't see. I'll say this nicely: You've changed with age. Changed? With Jean-Luc, for example... The stagehand. What did I do to Jean-Luc? Nothing. That's just it. You don't see the life he has. - What life does he have? - A tough one. He lost his children. One child... My, my... He had a child who died. Then they had another one. And he died, too. They realized that the mother killed them. She had Stockholm syndrome. Munchausen syndrome. Yes, Munchausen. Really funny! You don't even see him. I'm really sorry. Bring me a mop! He's tired. We're all tired. Don't leave! Thanks. She's right. We're all very tired. I'm waiting for a taxi. I'm off. Bye. What? My taxi... I could drop you off. Yeah, I'd like that. The bus would be more fun. We could take the last bus. It's 3 after midnight. Bus 160 is there. Let's go! Was I dreaming? Did you and I... Did we kiss once? No, you weren't dreaming. Marvellous. Plus, every night on stage... it's also marvellous. Are there feelings? Or am I dreaming? No, you're not dreaming. There are feelings. Then we agree. Excuse me for asking more... Those feelings... Where are they leading? No, it's... a scene, a play... It's theatre. I kiss you, I love you. My salvation... You're my love in a play, not in life. - My forearms ache. - Stop complaining! It's working when it hurts. Go on! One, two! To the rhythm! Faster! I can't do it. I have arthritis. I'm old. Why make me practice sports? I know how to swim. You'll make me fall. - Let me go. - We'll fall out the boat! Idiot! Get old if you want to. I want beautiful arms, so I'll row. I'll row. I'll row. "This string isn't strong enough." "Now it's all clear. "Those children love each other. "Well. So much the better. "What am I...? "My God, I don't know myself. "So I'm there? "Am I jealous of Vera? "Am I... "in love with him? "Pardon. "I feel... "Overwhelmed. Overwhelmed." "It's the first time... "It's so strange to me. "I'm in love now "for the first time. "He must leave "and Rakitin as well. "I have to come to my senses. I took a step "off the path and see what I've come to." Natalia Petrovna! I want to tell you something about me. I want to help you. I see that you need help. I'm going to tell you what my tragedy is, my torment. What are you doing? Jean-Luc. Well, nothing. It's dangerous here. Plus, everyone has left. You think they're stupid. Everyone seems stupid to you now. No, you don't understand me. Plus, even if they were stupid, what would it matter? A sad soul is most fatiguing. It's true, you have something of Natalya Petrovna. Something, I don't know... You want us to meet? Your Natalya and my Natalya can meet? Hello. My name is Natalya Petrovna. I'm here to buy gloves. And you? How funny! I was going to say my name is Natalya Petrovna and I'm here to buy gloves. Gloves? You too? What a lack of imagination! What colour? White. It's summer and I'm in love. Why are you looking at me like that? - Me, too. - What? I'm in love, too. I won't ask with whom. Could it be... Yes, it could. "I have only known other kinds of women. "Excuse me, Natalya Petrovna, I can't speak to women. Excuse me, Natalya Petrovna, I can't speak to women..." "You didn't want me to take away unpleasant memories of you." Dammit! "You didn't want me to take away unpleasant memories of you. "Well, me neither. "And I don't want you to think of me as... "I don't know how to say it. Excuse me, I can't speak to women." "They're looking for you everywhere." "It's you. "Who is looking for me? Alexey Nikolayevitch. Don't forget that..." "Arkady is looking for you." - Excuse me. - We're closing! Who are you? The priest. Won't you give me a child? I have no husband, no time. I'm very maternal. I'll be very caring. Like a gift. I thought giving was part of Christian life. Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via? The light quivering modestly in the morning. Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via? When are you coming back? When are you coming back? I won't. I don't want to be married. Get out and don't come back! I need to fly. You'll see me happy. You'll be happy, too. You deserve more than an unhappy woman. Denis Reynart. You have breasts, a pussy. A marvellous pussy. Rakitin! You're sad. You're heartbroken. Jean-Luc! Is anyone here? You're a nice little boy. A nice little boy. And I'm a nice mother. I lick you. I lick your ear. You like that? But I smell poop! Careful... Don't hurt yourself. Don't hurt yourself, my darling. What do I see here? Silly me! What's your name? That's pretty. Yes, yes, yes! I love you very much. I love you very, very, very much. I hold you in my arms. Maybe you're a little hungry. Here, here, here... Look... What are you doing? What are you doing? - This is my dressing room. - That's my daughter. She was crying. I held her. I'll take her. I won't allow you. I'll never let you touch her. She was screaming. You left her alone. Babies cry. You're crazy. You're sick! I came just in time. You were licking her ear. - What? - You gave her your breast. Crazy! "Natalya Petrovna, I don't know what to tell you. At the time of leaving you, my heart's overwhelmed." Did I wake you? It's 4 am. It's night. I wasn't asleep. I can't sleep anymore. Me neither. - Too happy. - Sorry? I'm in love. I wanted to learn English for my world trip. Yes, I know. I've been taking English lessons. I know, at Berlitz. At Berlitz. But I ended up with a professor. Of English. He's Irish. 30 years old. He's my "tutor." During conversation practice, I told him all about my life. He even kissed me. But you can't speak English. There's a bothersome noise in my room. I can hear it. Maybe I could sleep with you? What is it? Nothing. Where are we? Who are you? I'm Marcelline and I'm sleeping with you. What time is it? You scared me. I'll turn on the light. Want a sleeping pill? If you can't sleep, then I can't either. I am sleeping. Want to take something? I'm sleeping with my eyes open. Fine. Forty years and nothing. - I'm sleeping, I told you. - No wonder men don't stay. They don't exist. There's only you in the world! Like a child. You haven't grown up. That's why you can't have children. You clearly won't have them. You're a child. An old child! And stupid, too! A stupid old little girl! Me, who has always hated stupidity and loved intelligence. Turn off the lights. I don't understand. I always hated softness, stupidity. Alright, I'll take a sleeping pill. You'll sleep soundly now. And my night is over. Quick, a sleeping pill for Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle is distressed. Her public is waiting. Her public loves her. Mademoiselle is an artist. She creates art. Shut up! Some water! Shut up, I said! Shut up or I'll kill you. I'll kill you tonight. I'll really kill you! And we'll need a spotlight. Thanks. I'm going to sing a song. For our Natalya Petrovna's birthday. This is for you, Marcelline. Alexey Nikolayevitch! Alexey Nikolayevitch, where are you? Alexey Nikolayevitch! I lost you! There you are! I see you! Stop! Wait for me! Alexey! Because the other day... Wait! Are my voice, my gestures faithful to you? I assure you, your dress and hat are very nice. Thank you. And my heartbeats? What heartbeats? No, not really. I think something is missing in your portrayal. It's your heartbeats. They're not quick enough. You're not in love, so it's normal. On the contrary, I'm very much in love. Have you seen the boy who just walked by? A marvellous young man. Somber, insolent... He eludes me. Yet I see something in his eyes. I should go. Thank you again. I'll hold you, I'll tie you down. I'm stronger than you think. Stronger than you, as strong as a man. I am a man! I was looking for someone. Nice evening, nice party. You're running. You walk too fast. You're brutal, Alexey Nikolayevitch, but I love it. I love your eyes. That little beauty mark on your right cheek. Maybe I love you. You don't speak to me. You don't see me. You're here. I was looking for you. You again? Can't you see I'm busy? - I want to speak with you. - What is it? What is it? To speak with you? I just wanted to apologize for the other night For leaving like that, like a thief. It was stupid. Is that all? No, all sorts of things. But I can't forgive you. Even if I wanted to. Why not? I have so many things to tell you. "Because I love you, Madam. There, because I love you." "Alyocha! "What did you just tell me? You love me?" Excuse me... Are you part of the troupe? I'm the actor who plays llayev, the husband of Natalya Petrovna. I can't hear you. Who? Nathalie! Eric! Your hair! Don't be so formal! You want to kiss me? Will you untie me? Untie me, free me... Yes, I'll free you. My love, my love... will give you wings. My wrist really hurts. It's not funny. - I want to touch you here! - You're tickling me. - Stop it. - And there! Stop it. I'm not a puppet. I'm a human being. I'm not a fantasy. I'm a human being. Untie me. There you are. What are you doing? I looked everywhere for you. I was worried. I was told you had left, but I found your bag. You forgot your bag downstairs. Am I disturbing you two? Are you doing some kind of scene? Theatre isn't my thing. I'm Nathalie's husband. I work in real estate. Eric... Sorry. I drank too much. I was just lying down. Parties always depress me. Do you like the spring? I adore it. It's apparently the season with the most suicides. Could you commit suicide? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. When you don't have children, you can commit suicide. That's what's good. That's why I'll never have children. That way I can commit suicide one day. Doing something after the play? I don't care. I don't feel like doing anything. Me neither. What time is it? Almost midnight. Sure there's still a bus? At 3 past midnight. Bus 160. Before the bus arrives, don't you want to kiss me? - A real kiss. - I'm not in love with you. OK. And tonight, I'm really not in the mood. I noticed. I had a little boy. He was mine and my mother's. I had a child with her. I wondered how we did it. I guess maybe we rubbed together... our two liquids came into contact and hers entered my belly and that made me pregnant. That's what I thought. I'm a gynecologist. My husband is a psychologist. His office is over there. Sorry, I'd prefer to speak with you. I've had other dreams. Three dreams three days ago. And then... On the same night... That same night... Another dream the night before. Can I tell you about that dream? "Monte Cristo sits up, gasping..." "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" Marcelline! What are you doing? Come here! Where are you going? It started. It started. Come back here! She's crazy! Where are you going? Come back here! "Are you interested, Natalya Petrovna?" She's leaving. She's leaving, she's fleeing... Good evening. You could be more careful! - They didn't see me. - Because it's dark. No, because I don't exist. Don't say that. I say what I want. I decide what to say. Your work is to say it. By the way, what are you doing here? Isn't it time? We must return to the theatre! Where's your hat? Take mine. It's perfect. Go on! They're looking for you. I can't anymore, Natalya Petrovna. Where are you going? Where are you going? "We have not had a proper talk, Alexey Nikolayevitch. I want to get to know you." "That's very kind of you." "You are afraid of me, I see. You won't be afraid of me when you know me." Wait for me! Where are you going? Stop! Adaptation: Richard Lormand Subtitling: C.M.C. - Paris
