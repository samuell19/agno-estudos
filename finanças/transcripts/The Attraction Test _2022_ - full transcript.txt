Morning, Doctor Carver! Hey Doctor Carver! Ethan, hi. Did you hear our big news? No. We're engaged. You and Clair? Oh, wow! Congratulations. Well, it's all thanks to you, Doctor Carver. If we hadn't participated in your study, I probably would have never discovered Clair was the one. I'm so happy for you. When's the big day? We haven't set a date yet, but when we do, we hope you can make it. I would be honored. I'm sorry, I have to run. I have media training, but you and Claire are the stars. You're the first couple in the study to get engaged. Oh! Anyway, congratulations again and let me know when you pick a date. Will do. - Ok, bye. - Bye. Ok Brooke, it's all very simple. So, I will just pretend to be a TV reporter and ask you some questions. Does that sound ok, Brooke? Great. Fire away, Vince. Alright. So, Dr. Carver, your new study is called The Dating Test. How does it work? Simply put, the dating test helps you find your ideal person. The one. Couples go on a series of dates wearing these watch-like devices that record your heart rate, dopamine levels, pulse ox and several other indicators. It's called the attraction tracker. But how do you know that they're your ideal match? Like, the one. Your level of attraction to another person is measured on a scale of 0 to 100. Meet someone who scores 95 and above, you've met the one. But is that all that love is? Just a series of chemical reactions on a score sheet? Yes. These physical signals are far more reliable than things like emotions. What about feelings? Feelings are like relatives at Christmas. They come and go. But isn't that how people have found love for, well, forever? Which explains why more than half of marriages end in divorce. How sad. Oh, sorry. Where was I? So, Doctor Carver, has this new study been tested? How do you know that it works? So far it's only been tested on students, but, just this morning a student of mine told me he is engaged to the person he took the study with. They both scored above 95. Wow! So, Doctor Carver, you've developed quite the reputation for your studies on love. Is the dating test your crowning achievement? Oh, no. This is just the beginning. There is so little research on the science of love. So much to learn. Well, thank you Doctor Carver. Is there anything you'd like to add? - No. - You sure? Oh, and here at Pemberton University, we conduct research with heart. Terrific, Brooke. How did it feel? Great. But, I'll have to check the tape. Can't trust feelings, right? Now I know what you're thinking. Where's the romance? Measuring neurotransmitters isn't exactly the stuff of Jane Austen. Is that what you're really looking for? Drama, heartache, corsets. Why rely on some abstract, gut feeling about someone when you can have quantifiable results that tell you if that person is the one for you. The dating test takes the guessing work out of.. - Rebecca, hi. - Hi, Brooke. Practicing for tonight? Yes, but it's fine. Come in. - How's the speech coming? - Great, I think. I'll just be giving a preview of the study. Well, you don't want to be giving away too much. Want to save it for the big study's release in two weeks. Vince is billing it as a teaser. Ah, perfect. He told me that the practice interview this morning went well. Mm-hm. Never thought one of my professors would get more TV time than the university's president. Rebecca, I am not... Oh, Brooke, I'm not complaining. Your research has put this school on the map. We plan on taking full advantage of our newfound notoriety. Have you heard the new branding slogan? Research with heart. Kind of humanizes it, don't you think? Mm-hm. I mean, it's not just about the data, right? - Uh. - Oh, Brooke. We are gonna ride your coattails. We intend to increase enrollment, funding, maybe even bump up our ranking. Oh, I don't know if my study can do all that. Brooke, don't be modest, my star professor. Or should I say Dean? Dean? Had a meeting with the Board. We think you'd be a perfect new Dean of Psychology. But, let's revisit it after the launch. Yes. Of course. And good luck tonight, I'll see you at the theater. Thanks, Rebecca. Oh, and no pressure, right? She's expecting a boost in donations, enrollment, ranking. All from your study? I know. Hm. Doctor Frankenstein, you've created a monster. But wait, there's more. She's thinking of naming me department Dean. Huh. That'd be kind of weird, having you as my boss. Wait, will you give me tenure? Stop. I'm happy where I am. Come on, psychology Dean? More coin, prestige, swanky receptions with that smelly cheese. And less time for research, my first love. Speaking of first love, how's it been since your last love? You mean Logan? I thought it was Landon. Landon was before Logan. Which makes your next boyfriend Lucas? Which makes my next boyfriend no one. I'm done. With guys whose names start with I? With guys period. With dating, swiping right. Oh, don't be a drama queen. Carly, I am not having my heart stomped on again. But you're the expert on love. Yes, with the science of love, why the heart races, the pupils dilate. The palms sweat. I thought that was a panic attack? It's why I developed the love test. I want people looking for love to find it. Ok, but what if you meet a guy who scores like a 98 on the attraction tracker? George Clooney's looks with Einstein's smarts? Unlikely. Anyway, I don't need men to get my dopamine fix. I have chocolate for that. Oh, no. Thanks. I hope to get my dopamine boost tonight. I have a date. And... You're doing the test with him? Not the whole thing, just some questions to see if he, you know, measures up. Good luck. But, if the chocolate offer still stands? You know, for later. In case my date's a dopamine dud. Hey, Molly. Are you in pain today? How's that leg doing, huh? Still a little tender, huh? Aw. How's Molly doing, Doctor Bennett? Good. Yeah, she'll be ready for walks soon. When will she be ready for adoption? Oh, I'd say a week, maybe two. Oh, look at that face. She'll be adopted in no time. And to think when I started we only had five dogs. Oh, I'm sorry, Max. Six dogs. Max, you don't count, you're not up for adoption. You mind taking her back to the kennels, make sure she's comfortable? Sure, Doctor Bennett, yeah, anything else? - Yeah, your advice. - My advice? Yeah, I'm going to a talk at the university with Taylor later and uh, things have been a little rocky lately. Flowers. Every woman loves flowers. Old school. I like that. Maybe sunflowers? Bright, cheerful. They bring good luck. In that case, maybe I'll get a couple dozen. Good girl. Ugh! Oh yeah. Perfect. Beautiful. Thanks. Way to a woman's heart. And her brain. Sorry? Oh, it's just, when a person receives flowers, it's actually their brain that produces the pleasurable feelings. Hm. That takes the romance out of it. Oh, romantic feelings don't really... Sorry, don't mean to get all science channel on you. Kind of a buzz kill. My favorite customer. How're you doing? Happy as a sunflower on a sunny day. - Speaking of which? - Oh, your flowers. Oh, this nice young man is holding them for you. Oh, uh, actually. There you go, Brooke, all paid for. Oh, thank you, Liz. Mm-hm. You got the final bouquet. I saved the best for last. Ah, you are the best! They're so beautiful. That they are. Well, see you next month, Brooke. Bye. Yeah. Bye. Ah, hey, oh, excuse me. Hey, um, those are my flowers. Oh, I'm sorry, but they're actually mine. You saw me, I was holding them. I know, but they're still mine. Do they have your name on them or something? Actually, I do a standing order. Ah. Oh. Uh, what about lavender? Makes a great aromatherapy. Very calming. Hm. You don't say. Cures insomnia. Oh, I sleep like a baby. - Hair loss? - I'm good. Stress? Getting worse by the moment. Look, I'm sorry, I just... What if we go halfsies? Halfsies? Split em 50-50. Um, if not lavender, then what about... You don't understand. I need all the luck I can get. You're right, I don't understand. Anyway, good luck. 60-40? 70-30? Final offer. Flower thief, we meet again. Ryan. Hi. Taylor, hey. Are Sophie and Kyle here? Not yet. What's this? Lavender. It promotes healing. It may just promote sleepiness. Hey, you want to see something really beautiful? Oh, it also cures hair loss. My new clothing line's out. This is the collection I was talking about, where elegant, modern and comfort blend into one. Huh. Nice. Nice? Ryan, these are $1500 outfits. People actually pay that? Yes. People with money. Something you had when you worked with Kyle. Taylor, let's, let's... Hey! Sorry we're late. Nice flowers. Don't get me started. I am so excited for this. Me too. Me three. Yeah me, who, who is this woman again? I told you Ryan, it's a professor who does all these studies on love. She developed this wearable biosensor and it monitors your body's attraction to another person. What? It gives you like an attraction score. I think she calls it a... Attraction tracker. After three dates, you know if you met your perfect match. Isn't that incredible? Incredible and totally ridiculous. Well, apparently her study's being published in a psychology journal. More likely "Ladies Home Journal". Is everything a joke to you Ryan? No, it's just, it's not how it works. Love is a feeling. It's like a giant fireball hitting you. - A fireball? - Yeah. - Like love at first sight? - Exactly. It just, you know, doesn't happen on the first date, forget about it. - Ready to go in? - Yeah, I'm right behind you. - Forget about it. - After you. Flowers? This is all your fault. This is all your fault! Ready? Ready as I'll ever be. FYI, we're recording this. We'll use clips for the study's release. Great. Good luck... Dean Carver. Dean Carver. It does kind of have a ring to it. And so the big question everyone wants to know, can the dating test really help you find the one. Can these physical indicators really tell you if someone is your one true love? All in less than a week? And the answer is... yes. It works. Eight out of ten people who scored 95 or above were identified as their partner's ideal match. So, now I have a question for you. What are you waiting for? Why wait for the mythical arrow to strike when you can do something to find the love of your life. Two weeks from today I will be back on this stage to announce the official release. I'd be happy to take a few questions. Yes, you. Oh. It's the man from the flower shop. How're my sunflowers doing? My sunflowers are alive and well, thank you. Do you have a question? Yeah, I was wondering if you've taken this dating test yourself? Researchers don't usually participate in their own studies. So the answer is no? Ryan, stop. Well, yes. I mean no, I never participated in the study. Well, with all due respect, Doctor, you're telling others to try something you're not willing to try yourself. - Ryan. Sit down. - What? People can decide for themselves. Vince, tell her to move onto somebody else. Brooke, Rebecca wants you to take another question. Another question. Hey. Taylor. Taylor, wait! That was so embarrassing. You're never interested in anything that I care about. Ever since you left your practice with Kyle, all you care about is your dog rescue center. I care about you. Face it, Ryan, it's... it's not working out. Taylor, come on. What, Taylor? Please! What... Thank you. Sorry about that, Brooke. I didn't like where it was going. I can handle that guy. I know. I just wanted it over. We can edit the video. Fantastic presentation. Congratulations. Thank you. Maybe we'll skip the Q & A next time. Do you have a question? Yeah, I was wondering if you have taken the dating test yourself? Researchers don't usually participate in their own studies. So the answer is no? Well, yes, I mean no. I never participated in the study. With all due respect- - Don't worry, we're deleting all that from the video. That bad? We just can't afford any hiccups right now. There's too much riding on the study's release. Sorry to interrupt, but we have an issue. Researchers don't usually participate in their own studies. So the answer is no? Well, yes. I mean no, I never participated in the study. Hm, well... Vince, we all saw that. Yeah, and so have 529,006 other people. I'm afraid someone recorded it on their phone. Oh no. It's getting a thousand hits a minute. Almost half a million likes. They're referring to Brooke as Doctor Cupid. The study's credibility. Brooke's reputation. The school's reputation. The new branding campaign. Fundraising. Enrollment. Our ranking. This is a disaster. It is. Unless, uh... Yes, of course, I'll take the study. That's it. I'll find a single professor on campus, we'll finish in a week and still have a week to prepare for the launch. But what about if you find, you know? What, find my perfect match? Vince, have you seen the eligible bachelors on this campus? Alright. They're not all bad. Problem solved. Perfect! Eventually we'll bump out this back wall and make room for more kennels. I gotta hand it to you, buddy, this place looks amazing. Yeah, thanks. Oh, check this out. What's this? This is a plan for the space next door. Wow! You've thought about everything. A little artificial grass, room for the dogs to run around. I love it. I guess this means you're definitely not coming back to the practice No chance. Another stake through Taylor's heart. Tell me about it. You heard from her? Nope. No, no, she's pretty upset. She says that I'm not interested in things that interest her. Like the dating test. That's one. You're not gonna believe this. Some PR guy from that university called me, he said he wants me to take the dating test with that professor. No kidding. What did you say? I said no, of course, I mean he hadn't even run it by the professor yet. Well, what if she agreed to do it? I would still say no. Although he did offer me a stipend. Really? How much? A lot. I think you should do it. It's like a week. It's, that's a week I'll never get back. But maybe you'd get Taylor back. Well, how-what are you talking about? Look, Taylor wants you to take this test thing seriously, right? - Yeah. - Ok, so, stay with me here. You take the dating test with the professor to convince Taylor that you're taking it seriously, and then I get a cut of your stipend. Huh. I mean, it would pay for a lot of artificial grass. That too. - Alright, let's do it. - Yes. - How do we tell Taylor? - Ah. Oh, you can bet, if I tell Sophie... Oh yeah, she's gonna tell Taylor. Exactly. What about a plan B? For what? How to tell Taylor? No, what if the dating test works and you fall madly in love with her? Ah, I would have felt something on the first time that we met. No giant fireball? Not even a flicker. Then we've got nothing to worry about. Ok. Let me see if I understand correctly. You want me to date you for a week? That's right, Doctor Matthews. We'll finish in a week. Ok. Oh, great, great, any chance you can start tomorrow? I need to check with my wife. You need to ask your wife. Yeah. Um, never mind. I thought... Hey honey, there's a professor on the phone. Okay, bye. Good news. The search is over. Vince has found you the perfect man to take the test with. He's a doctor. Really? 'Cause I think I've asked almost every professor on campus. Hello again. Uh, Brooke, meet Doctor Ryan Bennett. You're joking. Doctor Bennett has... Ryan, please. Uh, Ryan has graciously agreed to take the test with you. You're not joking. Brooke, we think this is exactly what's needed to get ahead of the viral video. - But him? - Yes, me. The guy from the flower shop. Oh, sorry, I thought you were the guy who was asking snarky questions. Snarky? Would you prefer rude? I prefer informed. Are you even a real doctor? Look who's asking snarky questions now. I prefer informed. If the dating test can get these two to fall in love, it can get anyone to fall in love. So, are you gonna ask me my astrological sign? Oh, he's cute. Who, that guy or the dog? Oh, come on, Brooke. A cute guy who runs Jolly Rovers Rescue? He can't be all bad. No? I can grin and bear it for a week. And your first date's this evening? "Date." Wow, who's that? He didn't say he had a girlfriend. Probably who the flowers are for. Doesn't matter. It's all for show. Brooke, you saw him in the flower shop just before your speech. It's fate. More like a fluke. Anyway, a week from now I can say I did the test and move on. Unless he turns out to be your perfect match. That guy? More like the dog. Ok. Born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. University of Chicago, Columbia. PhD in social psychology. Pioneering in studies on the science of love. More like pseudoscience. Hm. Wish my college professors looked like that. What do we have in here? Ok, it's ready. Neurological studies of interpersonal closeness. My dissertation. Oh, romantic. So, I did a spreadsheet to... Wait, wait, wait. We have spreadsheets? Yes, to plot out the times, places and objectives of our dates this week. Our dates have objectives? Yes, didn't you read the background info I sent you? Uh, yep. Yeah, I skimmed. Which is why I brought you this. Wow. Well, I hope this is a take home test. It includes the complete study, a list of questions, types of dates and appendices. You'll need this. Oh, Doctor Carver, you shouldn't have. I didn't get you anything. The biosensor monitors your heart rate, pulse ox, and a bunch of other things. Hm. And who monitors the monitor? Me. I'll record the scores after each date. Wow, if I knew you were keeping score I would have shaved. We go on three different types of dates to compare our compatibility in different settings. Hm. What? It's in your folder. I'm sure. After tonight's introductory date, we go on a stress-inducing date followed by a romantic date. We'll finish in a week. Do you want to go first? Uh, for what? The list of questions. It's in your folder. Hm. Well I... You know what, I thought we'd just get to know each other a little bit before we... You were born and raised in New Hampshire, youngest of three. Father a teacher, mother a nurse. Undergrad Yukon, Cornell veterinary school. Ten months ago you opened Jolly Rovers Rescue and based on your social media posts, you have a very attractive girlfriend. - Impressive. - Thanks. Not so sure about the girlfriend right now. You were born in Muncie, Indiana. Younger brother in Texas, mother and father both college professors. University of Chicago undergraduate, PhD at Columbia with a focus on social psychology. Known for your pioneering studies on the science of love. - Touché. - Hm. Now, the list of questions. Where's your folder? - On here. - Well, of course it is. Ah. Ok. - Ah, hmm. - Thank you. Alright. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common. - Uh, we're both human. - I think that's cheating. Ok. Uh, we both live in the same city. One. - We're both doctors. - Two. We both... Let's see. We both... We both are stumped on the third thing that we have in common. Good enough. Ok. Name something you consider to be a positive trait in your partner. - Next. - Next. Mm. Oh, I got one here. When did you last sing to yourself? Never. You never sing to yourself? Never. So what, you've never done karaoke? Once, which also answers question 16. Share an embarrassing moment in your life. Hm. Well, I sing to myself from time to time, around the house. Had to be you, it had to be you, huh? Yeah. Why don't you sing to yourself? That's why. Ho, ho, ho, ok. For the jugular on the first date. Ok, why don't we just do this or that questions. Sure. Cat or dog? That's a gimme. TV or book? Book. - Cake or pie? - Cake. I'm on a roll here. Ok. Passenger or driver? Passenger. You get to see more things. Driver you're more in control. Winter or summer? Winter. Summer. Baseball or football? Football. I don't do sports. Lions or bears? Lions. Bears, by six points. Oh, you really don't do sports. Oh, excuse me. Oh, no. I have an emergency. Uh, a dog has an obstructed airway. Oh, you have to go? Afraid so. Well, I understand. Maybe we can reschedule? Maybe not. You can come with me. To the dog rescue? Dog adoption center. Yeah, this is a quick procedure and then we can pick up afterwards. Okay. Hate to see you revise your spreadsheets. How long has he been breathing like this? Since he came in. Okay. Alright, buddy. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, it's obstructing his airway. It's really far in though. Should I sedate him for an extraction? No, I don't think there's time. Um, I have an idea, it's not conventional but it works. Ok. Uh, Brooke, you might want to back up a little bit. Oh, ok. Ok, buddy. Yeah. You ready? Three, two, one. There you go, buddy. Good job. Ok. Good job. Oh boy. So, why a vet? Why not a people doctor? Other than cheaper malpractice premiums? I don't know. It's just, always loved animals. A vet that runs a dog adoption business. Right. Before that I was in a private practice with a business partner. Why'd you give it up? Well, I still practice veterinary care, but running a dog adoption center had always been a life-long dream. Nice. Being a scientist was always my life-long dream. What do you know? What? That's the third thing we have in common. Both in our dream jobs. Hm. - It's my stop. - Mm-hm. - So, about tomorrow's date. - Hm? Choose an activity that induces high levels of stress. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I know mine. I know mine. I'll text you. I'll text you back. - So, one down... - Two to go. Was that the weirdest date ever? Absolutely. Who plans their dates with spreadsheets? - I meant the choking dog. - Yeah, that too. - Well. Goodnight, Doctor Carver. - Goodnight, Doctor Bennett. So? How was your date? It went fine. Until a dog spit rawhide at me. What? In the restaurant? No, I went with him on an emergency call. He gave the Heimlich to a dog choking on one of those rawhide things. It was pretty funny actually. I don't know, Brooke. Sounds to me like you did more than grin and bear it. Oh, stop, Carly. Warrior two. What was his score? Actually, I think I need to recalibrate the... Brooke. Wow. Impressive for a first date. Sometimes multi-variant data can... And your score? 89. You two are approaching ideal match territory. It's probably just an anomaly. Not for someone who has "in data we trust" tattooed on her... Stop. How was your date? Ugh, disaster. Never made it past the second question. What? Name the last book you read? He said "War and Peace". I mean, no one actually reads "War and Peace". He might have. Have you read it? I started it. Exactly. He was just trying to impress me. Ok, well you should actually do all of the questions. I'm taking the speed dating route. Only asking three questions. Name a cheesy song you love, who would be your ideal dinner guest and what's the most beautiful view you've ever seen. And that's your plan to finding the perfect match? Yes. I want a guy who reads poetry and loves sappy love songs. Who wants to have dinner with Plato. Not J Lo. - What about Vince? - What about Vince? You don't notice the way he looks at you with that shy boyish smile? Brooke, he looks at everyone with that shy, boyish smile. Mm-hm. If you say so. So, what's your big date tonight? The stress-inducing date. Downward dog. That's your downward dog? No, this is my tired dog. I can't do this. - You haven't bowled yet. - I know, but... - Brooke. It's just a game. - Oh, no. This game is evil. Its sole purpose is to torment, ridicule and degrade. Leaving people without a scrap of dignity. Bowling? Everyone watching you while you're making a fool of yourself. I mean, that's the fun of it. Do I look like I'm having fun? Uh, ok. Um, I won't look. Very chivalrous of you. Ok, don't look. I'm not. I'm not looking. I won't. That didn't sound great. It looked even worse. - Can I look now? - No. Let me go again. That sounded better. You really are a terrible liar. Just go. Hey, that wasn't easy. I should get bonus points or something. I mean, it's not surprising when you are bowling with these. It's really not that hard. Can I just show you one thing? - Sure. - Ok. Alright. Now, you want to swing your arm back, keep your wrist straight and as you swing forward, release the ball. But remember, keep your wrist straight. - Ok. - Alright. - I think I have it. - Ok. Great. Ok, wrist straight. Yes! See, it's all in the wrist. Yeah, thanks. Your turn. Alright. - Yeah!! - Oh! It's all in the wrist. Thank you. Well, I survived. Well, more than survived, you bowled a perfectly respectable 63. So, what if someone scored a 63 on your attraction tracker? Only a 63? Probably not a keeper, but that's why we go on three dates. I take the average. Hm. curious, what was my score after the first date? I only reveal the scores at the end. No exceptions? You were above 63. Oh yes. I'm perfectly respectable. So, what is it with you and bowling? - Childhood trauma. - Left a scar? On me and almost on several eight-year-old boys. Wow. There's a story there. My brother's eighth birthday, I was 10. We had a bowling party. I was warming up, you know, getting the old arm limber and holding onto my ball and swinging my ball back and forth and back and forth and... it slipped. This can't end well. Ball flew out of my hand, took out the birthday boy and three of his friends and the party clown. That clown probably had it coming. No one got hurt but the ball didn't stop rolling until it smashed into the snack bar. I can still see the look on that little boy's face as he saw it coming towards him. His loaded nachos went everywhere. - That's traumatic. - Expensive too. I mean, insurance only covers so much. Right. So, what makes your half of tonight's dates so stressful? Well, you'll see. Did we get through all those questions? Uh, there's still a few more. Oh, here's a good one. Describe a perfect day you've had. Uh. I know mine. Go for it. Well, it's mostly perfect because it started off so imperfectly. When I was a little girl, I was at my cousin's wedding and I lost Screech. Screech? My stuffed snowy owl. I was devastated. Inconsolable. Well, I was the flower girl and I was supposed to carry white lilies. Nice. But, when I got to the church, the bride handed me this huge bouquet of sunflowers. I hear you're fond of those. She said they would brighten even the darkest day. And they did. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. More beautiful than a snowy owl? Definitely. But not as cuddly. Still, it cheered me up and even today whenever I need a pick me up... You buy sunflowers standing order. They're just happy flowers. Sounds pretty perfect. So, what about you? That's gonna have to wait because it is time for my stress-inducing date. More stressful than bowling? Yes. And for you, definitely more painful. - I warned you. - You're not that bad. You're a worse liar than me. Oh, sorry, sorry. We should-this was a bad idea. It's no worse than bowling. And that ended ok. True, except bowling was only stressful for one of us. Well, this isn't stressful for me. Painful maybe. I feel like I'm back in high school. You went to your high school dances? A few. What, you didn't? A few. Oh. Let me guess, you were the shy girl at the back of the gym? Yeah. Big thick glasses, before you got your contacts. Yep. Hoping that that weird, annoying kid in science class didn't ask you to dance? Ken Friss. That kid was a wizard with a petri dish. He has an annoying name. I bet you were the guy all the girls wanted to dance with. Uh, no. No, I was more like your buddy Ken. Just trying to work up the courage to ask that shy girl with big thick glasses to dance. I'm always going for the strong silent type. Woah! Sorry. I think we should just stop. Come on, you two. I could drive a truck through there. Get closer. - Oh! - Isn't that better? And a little bit less swaying. You look like drunk sailors. Remember, it's one, two, three and back. One, two, three. Try. One, two, three. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Ok, what if I try leading, if that wouldn't wound your ego? - No, better than wounding you. - Ok. - Should we take it from the top? - Mm-hm. Oooh. Hey! I'm dancing without maiming anybody. So, other than proving that you're as bad at bowling as I am at dancing, what was the purpose of tonight? Relationships aren't all wine and roses. People need to see how they react to each other during times of stress. The biosensor tells you that? It measures norepinephrine, the stress hormone. Hm. Can love really be explained so scientifically? I mean, there's no room for mystery and magic? Only in fairy tales. Well not for me. I'm a love at first sight kind of guy. You don't think you can grow to love someone? Not if you don't feel that lightning bolt the first time you meet. I mean, it is such an amazing feeling. It's like your heart's about to burst. It's very romantic. And, messy. - Ryan there's- - But then- - Sorry. You go. I want to be clear with you. I'm only doing the test with you to say I did the test. No, I figured. Yeah, I saw your video on social media, Doctor Cupid. Truthfully, I'm done with dating. I mean, actual dating. My history with men is a joke and I'm always the punchline. Hm. I'm not having my heart broken again. I thought you didn't believe in broken hearts? I don't. But it sounds better than a precipitous drop in oxytocin levels. Well, I guess you should know that I'm only doing this to win back my girlfriend. How will this help you win her back? Well, Taylor and I came and saw your talk that night and after she wanted to take the test and I kind of made fun of her. I like her already. Well, I guess I'm trying to do this to show her that I'm taking it seriously. Taking her seriously, you know, impress her. So, let's impress her. Let's show her you wooing the socks off of me and only the socks. How? The university wants me to do a video tomorrow night and talk about how I'm doing the study with you. You know, strange bed fellows and all that. Ok. They think it will diffuse the viral video. Hmm. So, why don't you be in the video too? We just have to make sure Taylor's there. Yeah, I can probably arrange that. And I'll act all, you know, charmed by your witty repartee. Well, maybe you could do like a hair flick thing. Oh, you mean like this? Oh, very convincing. Great. I'll text you the details. Great. And then tomorrow's our last date? The romantic date with gifts. Then we're done. Perfect. Oh, can you do that hair flick thing one more time? Save it for tomorrow. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean "spark"? When we were dancing. You mean like a bzzt spark, or like a boom, love at first sight kind of thing? Definitely not a kaboom. Was more like a flicker, you know? It was like a warm tingle. Ok, that sounds serious. It's actually just nothing like I expected, you know? She's more flexible and self-deprecating. She's funny. Hold on, time out. Are you talking about spreadsheet woman? Yes. She's got a whole other side. A fun side, you know? I mean, you should have seen her bowling. She was great. She was funny. She's just fun. What? The look on your face, like a lovesick puppy. Yeah, well she also said that she's only doing it so that she can say that she did it. You know, it's a PR thing for her. Well that's fair. You're only doing it to impress Taylor. I told her that. Really? What did she say? She said that she wants to help me woo Taylor. Seriously? How? Ok, I need you to bring Taylor to the theater at Pemberton, 7:30PM. Tonight? What for? I'm gonna do a video with Brooke, ok? Huh. The university thinks it's gonna take some air out of this viral video and I think it's gonna show Taylor I'm taking her seriously. Ah! I get it. Now, but don't tell Taylor that I'm in the video. Surprising her? Ok. What do you want me to say? Anything. Just make sure she's there at 7:30PM, ok? Got it. Thank you. Hey, Soph, listen. I need a favor. I understand we have a special guest tonight? Yes, I invited Ryan. Pure genius, Brooke. And we'll link tonight's video with the one that went viral. People will see you're taking the test with him and... Crisis averted. We'll do our best. And I'm sorry you're just seeing this now, Brooke. I had to revise it when I heard about Ryan. A script? Vince, I can't memorize this in time. Oh, no worries. It'll be on prompters. We just want to play it safe. No more surprises. Well, break a leg. Oh, sorry, Vince. Oh, Carly. Hi. So, I'll be in the back. You are going to crush this. Thanks Carly. Looks like you two are falling in love. Oh, um, the scores are surprising but it's still the average that counts. You remind me of myself when I was your age. A rising scientist thinking I could save the world with data. When it came to dating, I had a checklist. Wanted to meet the perfect man. Eventually, I met someone who checked off all the boxes. Did you marry him? Yes, and I was miserable. He had everything I thought I wanted but nothing I truly needed. Affection. Acceptance. Forgiveness. And a heck of a lot of fun. Oh, I'm sorry, Rebecca. I always thought you were happily married. Oh, happily remarried. Oh, I ditched the checklist. Followed my heart. Good luck tonight. Kyle, why are we here again? I told you, Doctor Carver invited you to the recording of her new video. But why me? Well, she... It's Doctor Carver's way of apologizing for how Ryan acted the other night. Exactly. I don't even know the woman. Well, she knows that you... She found you on Ryan's social media. Exactly. And as a woman she knows what it's like to be with a guy who thinks he knows absolutely everything. Exactly. Come on, we're gonna be late. - Hey there. - Hey. She's here, Taylor. Great. I've been practicing. Perfect. About the script. I didn't know... Yeah, Vince gave it to me. I thought we'd just wing it, you know? Let our natural charm flow. They don't want any surprises. The surprise is how lame this is. Come on, what happened to our witty repartee? He means well, I know though. We should go. Your tracker. Thank you. So, yes. It's official. I am doing the test. And while I've never participated in one of my own studies before, I have to say it's been, well, interesting. But what's really been interesting is who I'm doing the test with. You may recognize my study participant. Veterinarian from Jolly Rovers Rescue, Doctor Ryan Bennett. Hello, Doctor Carver. Hello Doctor Bennett. Yes, it has been interesting "dating" you. Yes, indeed. You were a real thorn in my side that night. And now every night I'm at your side. I wrote that. You certainly are. We just have to survive one more date, to... So, what's been your favorite date so far? Oh, um... Hm? How about the time when we went bowling? Uh... Yeah. She's the only person I know who can turn bowling into a contact sport. Good one. Oh, what about our dancing date? Last time I wear open-toe heels with him. And don't ever agree to help him treat a choking dog. I told you to stand back. He pushed on that dog's stomach, and whoosh, this slobbery thing shoots right past my face and nearly hits me. Well, that's a small price to pay for saving a life. Oh, easy for him to say. He wasn't covered in dog drool. Oh, well. We did have our romantic moments. Oh, really? Where was I? Out on the dance floor when... I remember seeing stars in your eyes. From you stepping on me. They're going off script. Ad-libbing. I know. Isn't it great? Ok, well, I admit that I felt something. Yeah, I always used to laugh at my friends who would tell me about this feeling, this warm glow they got when they slowly get to know somebody, but... It's true. It's the best feeling. It's like this heavy blanket on a cold morning. It's warm and safe and you just don't want to be anywhere else. Just feels right and easy and a little scary. But not as scary as her bowling. Or as painful as his dancing. Mm. Brooke... Now, I'll admit, some of that was actually quite funny and at times even touching, but I thought we agreed to stick to the script? And I admire someone who takes chances. Oh, well, um, well, it was pretty funny, choking dog. I'm sorry, Rebecca. I just got caught up and... No need for apologies. Good on you for taking a risk. It's a quality I'll be looking for in the next psychology dean. And I know this wasn't part of the plan, but you two make a really great couple. Oh. Mm-mm. I just... Hey. Sophie said that you did this for me? I did. Surprised? Only that you wanted me to watch you flirt with a pretty professor. Flirt? No. No, no. That... that was, that was an act. Could have fooled me. I was doing this to, you know, show you that I'm taking it seriously. You know, impress you. You want to impress me? Go back to your private practice with Kyle. Taylor. Ryan. I really think it's about time that you give up this whole dog adoption thing. This dog adoption thing is my life's dream. Can't it be more, you know, a hobby? Have we always been this far apart in what we want in life? Yeah. You just couldn't see it. That fireball you felt when we met, it took time for the smoke to clear. Goodbye, Ryan. Hey, was she surprised? Uh, yes. So, the plan worked? Yes, you were, you were really great. You were very, very convincing. Well, I mean, you too. I mean, the look on your face when you went on about our moment on the dance floor was Oscar worthy. Yeah. - What? - Nothing. Well, good night then. And again, great acting job. Thank you. You too. Oh, you forgot about the... Oh! Right. Well, I'll save it. In case you guys break up again. Smart. Well, good night. Good night. It's true. It's, it's the best feeling. It's like this heavy blanket on a cold morning. It's warm and safe and you just don't want to be anywhere else. This feels, feels right, and easy. Get it together, Brooke. Eye on the prize, girl. You're only doing this for damage control. Not to find your... I can't even convince myself. How's that? You in pain, girl? She's been walking fine. I think she's good to go. Can I put her on the adoption list? Yep, she's ready. Oh, you hear that, Molly? You're gonna have a new home. Yeah. Probably sooner than later. I'm gonna miss you, Molly. Jen, you mind closing up tonight? Sure, Doctor Bennett. Going out with Taylor? Nope. We broke up, actually. For good this time. I'm sorry. Thanks, but she was never on board with this whole dog adoption thing. I see. What does Doctor Carver think? Brooke? Yeah, yeah. She's on board with it. It's actually one of the things we had in common. Both in our dream jobs. I don't mean to pry, Doctor Bennett, but seeing you and Doctor Carver in that new video... The one from last night? That's up? Mm-hm. You two are so cute together. Maybe things will work out with her? Doubtful. This is our last date, tonight. But thank you. Mm-hm. So, this is it. Our romantic date. Oh, I can tell. Candlelight, white table cloth, overpriced wine. Hey, all this romance doesn't come cheap. Not for you at all. Not true. I do believe that people feel something that they call romance. And you call? A rush of feel good neurochemicals that flood the brain, producing a wave of euphoria. Hm. You know what? I think I'll just stick with good old-fashioned romance. Suit yourself. Did you bring the gift? You? You first. As long as you're dancing nothing can hurt you. Aw. Just what I wanted. Dance lessons. For the man who has everything. Including two left feet. You're not, you know, offended? Not at all. No, thank you. I'll think about you every time I step on my partner's toes. Ok. Your turn. Oh, it's very light. It's definitely not a book. No, I saw your office. You have more books than a school library. Well, it's not jewelry. That's far too romantic. Hate to see you hit by a rogue wave of neurochemicals. Ah, well... I'll... Just open it. Ok. Ok. Screech! Hope it's ok. It's perfect. It's just like the one I had when I was growing up. And just as cuddly. Thank you. You're very welcome. Um. So, our last date. It is. Is there a formal way to end the study? You know, say goodbye. It's been fun, keep in touch. You know, catch you on the flip side. I don't think anybody says that anymore. - I say that. - Ok. Hey, what if uh... What? What if I wanted to have, I don't know, one more date? To show Taylor that this is something you're really invested in? Uh. I'd do another date. Me too. I mean, we could go on one of the bonus dates. Bonus dates? It's in your folder. Appendix B. There's an artsy date, an exercise date, a new-experiences date. Yeah. What's that? It's something neither of us has done before. So, one more date. One more date. It had to be you It had to be you I wandered around and finally found somebody who... You're singing. Oh, sorry, was I interrupting you? No, no. It's great. Ok. You are really happy lately. Happier than I've seen you in a very long time. Carly, I know where you're going with this and it has nothing to do with Ryan. - Really? - Mm-Hm. Hmm. Wow. You're up to six. So much for one more date. Now the study has more variables to ascertain. Oh, Brooke. Would you listen to yourself? Human emotions do not compute. I am equipped with a data-driven heart. Boop-boop. Boop-boop. Are you finished? Boop. It's obvious. You've fallen for him. What? No. He is your screen saver. Agh-agh, no. We saw an old photo booth at the bowling alley. Huh. Cute stuffed toy. We had a gift giving date. Flowers? I bought those. Still, two out of three. Better than my average lately. Your dates? What, the three-question thing isn't working out for you? Ugh. Train wreck. Every guy. Oh, I'm sorry. Like I ask one guy, name a cheesy song. He goes "I don't know any songs about cheese." Think that's bad? Two guys said that their ideal dinner guest would be Kim Kardashian. Oh, gosh. Should have just skipped the third question. What's the most beautiful view you've ever seen. Wait, don't tell me. Kim Kardashian. So, no poetry and sappy love songs. The last guy scored negative seven. I'm so sorry, Carly. Whatever. But you two clearly have something going on. Your scores are in the 90's. The study's goal is 95. But how did he score where it counts? Here. The study doesn't have a protocol. Oh, and the robot is back. Oh, ok. You're right. Ryan is great and funny and charming and kind of sweet. I knew it. Who's trying to get back with his girlfriend. By going on more dates with you? To show her he's invested. Look, ok, I have seen you with Logan, with Landon, with Lucas... There was no Lucas! And now I've seen you with Ryan and I've never seen you so happy. I mean, you are singing. Ok, but the thing is Carly, I was happy with Logan and Landon and pretty much every guy I've ever dated but I can't expose my heart again and watch it crumble into a sad pile of rubble. Ok. I'll let it go. For now. Look, we have one more date, this Saturday night and then I will thank him for doing the dating test and say bye and never see him again. Except on your screen saver. Oh, right. I'll delete that. Ready for a new experience? Ok. Are you sure about this? Yes. Neither of us have baked before. This is gonna be fun. Hm. You said the same thing about bowling. So, what are we making? You like chocolate? Of course. In fact, studies show that nine out of 10 women like chocolate. The tenth is lying. Oh, buh-dum-ching. Ok, so. Chocolate what? Mousse? Oh la la. You do set the bar high. Cake? Hm. That requires layers. Lower. Brownies? Lower. If we go any lower we'll be licking batter off our fingers. Well that does sound weirdly appealing, but no. How do triple threat chocolate fudge cookies sound? Threatening. What's in 'em? Dark chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, chocolate covered walnuts with a chocolate drizzle. That would actually be a quadruple threat. Wow, only you would count. So, where's the recipe? No recipe. It's gonna be an adventure. It'll be inedible. We need a recipe. Ok, come on. Let's cook from here. Romantic but not practical. We need a recipe. Brooke, where is your adventurous spirit? Ok then. Let the fun begin. Ok. That's the spirit. Ok. Moment of truth? Please. Ladies first. You're either very chivalrous or very cowardly. Let's try them at the same time. Ok. That's not bad. Not bad at all, considering we didn't use a recipe. Well, you see? Is this your "I told you so" moment? No, this just shows that you can use this instead of this. I'd rather use this. I'm just saying that, you know, not everything needs to be measured and quantified. Definitely an "I told you so" moment. Bottom line, these are great. Hmm. Perfect. Uh, speaking of which, you never answered question 11. Describe a perfect day you've had. Ah, well, lately that would be every day. How so? Rather than tell you, why don't I show you? Ah what, now? Yeah. Yeah. Right now. Ok. Can I bring the cookies? - Sure. - Ok. As long as you're willing to share. My perfect day would start here. At work? Well, it's not work to me. Do I get the full tour this time? Sure. Gonna leave the cookies here though. Oh. Ok. Let's go. And over here, these are all of our dogs. I could adopt them all. Well, that can be arranged. Oh! Here's a cutie! Hello. Molly, this is Brooke. Hi Molly. Oh, she says hi. Oh, what a smart dog. She says "adopt me." Aww. I wish. But if I ever do... - Uh-oh. - Hello! Someone's jealous. Oh! Hi. This is Max, my dog. Hello Max! Oh, you're beautiful too. What do you think, should we take them for a walk? That's a yes. Yes. So, how did I score on the test? Thursday night I am giving a speech to release the study and I'll reveal the scores. Hm. How did I do? Oh, you've been replaced. Good choice. - Oh, oh. - Hey, Molly. Come here. Molly come here. Well, that works. Well, admit it, you're in love. Ryan, I... With Molly. I mean, she is definitely in love with you. Oh, and how do you know that? Doctor Bennett? Well, the way she looks at you. I mean, checking on you. With those eyes. She's up for adoption, just saying. I'll keep that in mind. So, what about people, Doctor Carver, how do you tell when they're in love? Well, you know, the usual. Just dilated pupils, racing heart, sweaty palms. I should get these guys inside. Come on, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go. So, that was my perfect day. Thank you for sharing it with me. My pleasure. So, I was reading Appendix B and it says that this was our last bonus date. Yes, it is. Oh, no. Um... What? Oh no, it's a... it's a big day tomorrow. I just, I'm polishing the script and rehearsing all day. I can help you rehearse if you want. Yeah. Thanks, thanks. But it's... I should go. Right. Um. It's been great. It's been really great. Thank you for everything. Give Molly a big hug for me. Yeah. I will. So, I guess this is goodnight. And goodbye. Yeah. Um, oh. This is your device. Thank you, Doctor Bennett. Catch you on the flip side. I love it. Great job. It's a really nice speech, Brooke. This is gonna be a huge boon to the university. The visibility we'll get from this. I invited local media to cover. Now, it's important, Brooke, that you don't reveal the attraction tracker score until tomorrow night. And, please don't tell anyone the real reason you did the test. What do we say to people when they see they didn't fall in love? Well that can actually lend some credibility to the study. There simply wasn't much attraction between Brooke and Ryan. We can't say that. I mean, look at the scores. Well, then maybe there simply wasn't enough attraction. That sound good to you, Brooke? Yes, of course. I mean, if study participants don't reach 95 then it's time to move on. Ok. Tell me. Kyle, I, I, I told you. I signed an 18-page contract agreeing not to say anything until the study is released. Come on, you don't need a score to tell you how you feel. Is Brooke the one? Kyle. Come on. Is she the one? Hmm? Yes. Yes. I knew it! I knew it. The way you talked about her, it was never like this with Taylor. Don't say anything, ok. Not even to Sophie. Ok. What about Brooke? How does she feel? I'm not sure. Not that it matters. Of course, it matters. It's kind of how love works. Well not when one of us has vowed never to fall in love again. Brooke, right? No, me. Yes. Brooke. She said she's done with dating. Well, that's what Sophie said and three months later we were engaged. She's just tired of dealing with heartbreak. Maybe this time she won't have to. Yeah, maybe, but... she likes numbers, you know? Not feelings. She wants love plotted out like data points on a graph. You know what I think? I think you should tell her how you feel. I don't know. She may be a scientist, but she still has feelings. So, at this point I'm going to reveal the score. So, I'll cross to the stage, and behind me will be a graphics showing... Ryan? I was told that I might find you here. Lou, can we take a quick break? Great, thanks. Hey, what's up? I know you're busy. I won't be long. Oh, it's ok. What's wrong? I've never seen your serious face before. This? Yeah, I know. I only bring it out for funerals and breakup speeches. Which is this? Neither. Although I did break up with Taylor. Oh. I'm sorry. When? Uh, like last week. Last week? Yes. I should have told you. We went on all those bonus dates. I know. I know, and I didn't go on them to impress Taylor. I went on them to-because... Well, I think I'm in love with you. What? And, so, I'm here you know, to see if maybe you feel the same way. Um. What happened to love at first sight? I was wrong. When we danced, I felt this flicker and that flame, it just seems to grow brighter. Every time that I see you. Um. Ryan, my big speech is tomorrow and... I know. I mean, there's a lot riding on this. Donations, enrollment, ranking. The president wants to make me Dean. I just thought... Yes, there was some attraction as reflected in our scores. Scores. Stop it. Stop with the scores. Come on. What are, what are your feelings? Feelings. I, I shut those down a while ago. Brooke. I felt something from you. I'm sorry. I, I never should have let it slip out. Slip out, Brooke. What are you... Ryan, I can't do this. Please just try to understand. I, I've had my heart broken so many times. As if I lost part of it, somewhere along the line. I'm sorry. And after the three required dates, we decided to try some bonus dates. We visited an art museum, rode a tandem bike. I even learned to bake cookies without using a recipe. A sweet adventure. All the while waiting to see if cupid's arrow would strike. Ugh. Enough about cupid. All the while waiting to see if a spark would ignite a flame within our hearts. Nope, sounds like heartburn. Blah, blah, blah. And now, for the big reveal. The question everyone wants to know. Did I fall in love, find the one? There you are. Oh. My favorite flower. Good. 'Cause there's a long trail of them leading to your office. They must be from Ryan. Huh. What a funny, charming, kind of sweet guy. Think he still wants to get back with his girlfriend? "Dear Brooke, I want you to know how much" "I enjoyed my time with you." "I will truly miss you." "Your smile, your adventurous baking." "Your crazy bowling skills." "I know you've had your heart broken one too many times "but I hope you don't give up on finding love. "You have a warm, beautiful heart "that deserves to be shared by some lucky guy. "Anyway, please accept this parting gift" "to help make your day a little more perfect." "Your devoted study partner, Ryan." You coming? What's going on? Ah, not going. Isn't Brooke giving the dating test results in like 20 minutes? Yeah, but it doesn't matter. The results, they don't mean anything. I mean, I tried. I tried to get through to her but she just, she doesn't feel the same way. There she is, looking every bit the star. Thanks Rebecca. You look great, Brooke. Thanks, Vince. Uh, Vince, can you give us a second please? Oh, of course. Yeah. Brooke, I don't know if you've had time to think about the Dean of Psychology position? - I have, yes. - Oh, good. I mean, I can't say this publicly, but you'd be at the top of my list. Thank you, Rebecca, but I won't be applying. What? Why not? Being Dean wouldn't leave enough time for my research. It's why I became a scientist. That's where my heart is. Oh, I see. Well, I can't say I'm not disappointed. But, I respect your decision. A woman who follows her heart and I trust you're applying that in your love life as well. It's show time. Oh, and for tonight, maybe it's best to... Stick to the script. Got it. Yeah. And you'd think after the bowling and the dancing we'd call it quits, but no. After the three required dates, we decided to try some bonus dates. We visited an art museum, rode a tandem bike... I even learned to bake cookies without using a recipe. A sweet adventure. All the while, waiting for a spark to ignite a flame within our hearts. And, it did. In mine, at least. Her name is Molly and she is the most adorable rescue dog ever. So now for the big reveal. Excuse me, I had a question. Uh yes, there'll be time for questions at the end. I was just wondering if you fell in love. You know, found the one? Yes. Yes, I did. I did fall in love, but I was afraid to tell the man that I fell in love with. It's the story of my life, really. Turns out, there's more to learn from my research. Love is infinite, mysterious and goes much deeper than data. You see, I had given up on love. Afraid my heart would take another beating. But, to be in love, even just for a short time is worth the heartbreak. - That's so sweet. - Cue the romantic music, right? - A good cheesy love song. - Cheesier the better. Um, random question, but who'd be your ideal dinner guest? Frost. Dickinson. Nope, Whitman. I like poetry. Two out of three. And, um, what's the most beautiful view you've ever seen? The one I'm looking at. Sorry to interrupt, folks. But, in case you didn't know, our new marketing slogan is Research with Heart. Which is exactly what Doctor Carver showed tonight. Heart. So, I have decided to postpone our study's release. Sounds like some revisions are in order. That ok with you? Remember Brooke, follow your heart. Thanks for the flowers. The way to a woman's heart. Well, like I said, just trying to make your day a little more perfect. Well, there is one thing that could make it more perfect. Yes! That's my boy!
