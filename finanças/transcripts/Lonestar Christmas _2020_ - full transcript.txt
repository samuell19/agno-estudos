Mom! We wrapped our teacher's presents. - Ah. - And you need to judge which one is best. - We don't have time. It's the last day of school before Christmas break, you don't want to be late. - But the loser has to make both of our beds. - For a week. - Oh wow, that's pretty serious. Okay, well we have five minutes before we have to leave so let's do this. Please place your presents upon the table. Very nice. It's going to be very tough. Carter, your use of adhesives is prolific. - What's prolific? - Don't worry, it's really good. - [Carter] All right, I win! - And Peyton, the way you seemingly use Christmas flare as a metaphor for the accesses of the holidays. It's insightful. - Oh yeah. I'm insightful. - But who wins? - It's too difficult to decide, I call it a tie. - [Peyton] You always call a tie. - Don't forget this, it's for your show and tell. - What's up with Nanna's hair? - [Erin] It was the style back then. - It wasn't very stylish. - Yeah, it's pretty silly. People liked big hair in the 90's. - Do we have one of these albums? - Hm, all y'all's pictures are online. I can print some out, but later. We gotta go 'cause I have an appointment with Tessa. [phone ringing] - Why do you never answer the phone when Grandee calls? - Okay, come on, we gotta go. Let's go. Grab your jackets, quick, quick, quick. [upbeat country music] - When am I ever gonna need to stack quarters? - Just pretend you're a bounty pirate, stacking your gold. - I'd like to make these useless fingers walk the plank. - Even when you aren't successful, you're and dexterity equals? - Blessed independence. - Oh, hold on. I don't want to forget, since this is our last appointment - Aw, you shouldn't have to get me a present. - I got all my patients a gift, but yours is special 'cause don't tell anyone you're my favorite. - You can't help yourself. I've got a magnetic personality. - That's true. Open it. - Is this just another exercise? - No, but good idea. Oh my, did you do this? - You like it? - I love it. - Good, I'm glad. - What are you and your girls doing for Christmas this year? - We'll just spend Christmas at my mom's. - Is your father in the picture? - My parents haven't been together since I was nine, so I don't see my dad very much. He's a good guy and I love him, it's just. - Does he live far from Austin? - A couple of hours. - Why don't you see him more often? - Do you want to try stacking the quarters with these fingers now? - Sometimes the holidays can be a lot of pressure. - Good job. Great. - [Nana] I never would have guessed Phil's Christmas present was a tropical holiday vacation. - He knows how much you hate the cold. - Do you think I will look good in this one? - Hm, you look good in everything mom. - Oh, I just want it to be perfect. - Oh Erin, I think Phil is going to propose. - Really? - Yeah! - Aw. - You know, I never thought I wanted to be married again after your dad, but Phil has melted my heart. - Mom, I'm so happy for you. - [Nana] Thank you. You know, maybe it's time that you started thinking about love again too. - Well, I've got work and the girls, I'm thinking about going back to school. Where exactly do I fit in the romance? - It's been three years now honey. - And we're doing great, so why upset the apple cart? - You are a wonderful mama to those girls. There's nothing wrong with having somebody to lean on. - I don't need anybody to lean on. - Honey, are you sure you're okay with this? - Of course I am. Mom, you deserve all the good and wonderful times. - So do you. I love you. - I love you too. I better go get the girls. I promised them we'd make brownies after work. Have fun packing. - I am going on vacation. - [Carter] It's officially Christmas break. - You know it's officially a Christmas break when we start decorating the tree. - Okay, wait until they cool down. Now your daddy taught me how to make those brownies. - 'Cause you can couldn't cook. - She still doesn't know how to cook. - That is right. We made a deal when we got married that I would make our lunches because I'm a very talented sandwich stacker and daddy would make dinner, but he taught me to make the Christmas brownies because he always used to say, everyone should have one holiday recipe they know by heart. - I miss daddy more at Christmas. - Me too, sweetie. But he's watching us from heaven, right? - Yeah, that's how he knows you burned the first batch. - Mom, the star's broken. - Oh, it's not broken, it's just been loved. I think I have some tape in the junk drawer upstairs. [phone ringing] - Oh, it's Grandee. Hi Grandee. - Peyton, hey. What do you know what's good? - We're decorating our Christmas tree. - Hi Grandee. - Hi there, Teddy bear. Where's your mama at? - Oh, she's upstairs. - She sure isn't easy to get ahold of these days. - She's really busy. - Yeah, you know, me too. We've got a whole mess of new goats out here on the ranch. - Really? - Can you send us pictures? - Farrah and I were hoping that maybe you'd come out Christmas for a visit and you could see it for yourself. - [Carter] Yes! - Hi dad. - Can we go to Grandee's for Christmas? - To see the baby goats. - [Dad] We'd love to see you. Farrah's got the house all done up for Christmas. You'll have to be careful, you come out here she doesn't decorate you too. - Oh, I don't know. - Please. - Please mom. - [Grandee] We've never had a Christmas with the girls. - Please mom. - Please. - Well, I, I did take the whole week off since the girls are out of school. - [Grandee] Well then come and spend it with us. I mean, Farrah would just about die of happiness having a crowd to cook for. - Please mom. - I love goats so much. - Okay. We'll come dad. - Yes! - We'll get the rooms ready. - Sure. - I can't wait to see you. - We'll talk to you later. - Bye Grandee. - Bye Grandee. - Well, I guess we're going to Grandee's. - Yay! - Yes!

Hi, sorry about this. - Same thing happened to me one time, except there was a queen size mattress on the interstate. - [Erin] Oh wow, looks like we could both use a knot tying class. - Hey! Where are you ladies headed? - Sorry, who were you? - Mateo. Need some help? - Thanks Mateo, but I, I think I can handle this. - Well, I mean we can't really go anywhere until we're all picked up, so I'll just help you. - Farrah is expecting us for dinner soon and we're going to be late. - Are you Gary's daughter? - Yeah. You know my dad? - Yeah. Him and Farrah come down to my restaurant pretty regular. He'd been bragging about his grandkids coming to visit him for Christmas. - Hi, I'm Erin. - Erin. Well hey why don't I um, why don't I load up the truck with the presents and I just follow you over? - Oh, thank you but I'm really okay. I think I can handle this. - All right, okay.

That would be great. - Oh, Merry Christmas, that's heavy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is that man a cowboy? - Why did you let him take our presents? - He's just helping us take then to Grandee's. - Then he's the handsome cowboy and we're the damsels in distress. - We are not damsels in distress.

Best tamales in town. - Oh, you're the tamale king? - Yeah, I, I didn't know they were going to call me that in the article. - They ranked your top tamale in Texas. - Well um, hey you should come on down to the restaurant. We'll give you the VIP treatment. Here, this has the address on it. - Thanks. Okay. - Okay. - [Mateo] Okay. - Let me give you a hand with the rest of those presents. - All the presents were safe and sound in the house, but you know what? I should probably head back to work. Dina's up to her eyeballs in masa so you folks have a good night and uh, it was really nice meeting you. - Well, thank you again. - Yeah. - Good seeing you. - Can I help you unload? - I've got it. [subtle country music] - Where's those squirmy grandkids of mine? - Well, they were driving us crazy begging to see the goats. so Farrah took them out to find pine cones for her projects. - You know, I've been trying to pull that tree stump out of there for a couple of weeks now. - But you decided to do it now? - Well Curtis lent me his back hoe for the day. - You promised them that they get to feed the baby goats. - And they will. - Please don't disappoint them, okay? - I will take them. I'm going to go wash up. [subtle piano music] - [Peyton] It's everywhere. Mom doesn't let us have glitter in the house. - Oh, don't worry. She and I made a deal that it's okay if all the glitter stays at my house. - [Carter] But how do the baby goats know who they are if they don't have names? - Well, I guess they just know. - But how? - Well, I never really thought about it. - They have to have names 'cause what if they get lost and we have to call them home? - Hm, well you'll just have to name them I guess. - This one is Coco. - And who's that? - [Carter] And she's Marshmallow 'cause she's all white. I think this one's Licorice. - Are they all named after food? - Of course. - All right. How'd you ladies like to help me wash up the dinner dishes for my loving bride? - Okay Grandee. - Okay, let's start, come here you. - Okay, y'all wash and I'll dry.

Hi, oh she's so sweet. - Yeah, they tend to get a bit ornery sometimes. But Farrah loves having them little critters around till they start eating your begonias. - What's this one's name? - Oh, that one is either Marshmallow or Whip Cream. - Is that goat for put the baby down and back away? - Oh, that's old Luna Belle. You guys best be careful around her. She has a tendency to nibble at your back side if you rub her the wrong way. - Well, I prefer to keep my backside in one piece. - Aw, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? - Hiding behind my aversion to pain. - That was just goat kisses. - Well, I'm going to go for my walk. Girls, listen to Grandee, okay? - Okay. - Hey girls, what do we got? [laughter] [upbeat country music] - Hey. - Oh, hey you. I was just picking up some pecans for my Christmas fruitcake. - Ah. - Your daddy is so happy that you and the girls are here. - I'm glad. - He'd love to see them more often, he talks about those girls all the time. - Things just get so crazy. - But you made it home for Christmas. - Well, the girls wouldn't let me say no. I didn't mean it like that. It just gets complicated with me and my dad sometimes. - Your daddy hasn't always been the most available, missing out on spending time with you has been his biggest regret. - Well, he's really good with the girls. - Sometimes being a grandparent is easier than being a parent. All the perks, none of the pressure. - I guess that's true. - Well, I better get these back up to the house, those fruit cakes won't bake themselves. - Okay. ♪ Deck the halls with bells of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la la ♪ - Okay, goofy girls.

Come on, I gotta go. - We want Grandee to read us a story. - Please Grandee? - Grandee's busy. - I don't mind. - They're wild tonight. - I'll take it as a challenge. - Okay. - Yes. - All right, let's do it.

I just remembered, I forgot to feed the dog. - When did you get a dog? - Just a teeny tiny dog. I may not have mentioned it. - What? - Yeah. You know, anyways I'm sure that you've got this all under control. So you don't mind if I just pop out and take care of that? - You don't even like dogs. - I really do now.

Maybe you could take her to the post office and get her out of our hair for a few minutes. - What's Erin gonna do at the post office? Ow.

You were here half the night prepping the mail orders. I will do the husks, just deal with the take out. - Thanks, you are best. Can you, can you hold down the fort later this afternoon? I have a thing. - A thing? You don't have things, you practically live here. What thing? - It's just a thing. - Oh, you have a thing with Ms. Saltshaker. - Okay, first of all, you know her name is Erin. Second of all, Farrah invited me. Third of all, we're having fruitcake. - Fruitcake, sounds serious. - Look, if you can't do it, I'll just tell them. - Oh, no, no, no. I can do it. - Thank you. - I will just be expecting more details very soon. - Got your order, sir. - Hi.

This looks like a good one. - I haven't done this in ages. - Well the difference is you used to shimmy up the tree. - Yeah, well I think my tree shimmying days are over. - I told Farrah I'd give her 500 feet of fake mistletoe and spring it around the whole house if she wanted. She said nope, had to be the real thing. You got this? - Yeah. - Pretty good with this ladder. Might have to get you to prune my peach trees. - Well, I've been handling all the yard work at the house now. - Yeah, it can't be easy raising those two girls by yourself. - We're doing okay. - Well Farrah and I, we'd like to pitch in if you let us. - Just enjoy being a fun grandpa. - Well, I want to be there for you too. - Bombs away.

I swear these children insist eating three meals a day. - Thanks for having me over, Farrah. - Do you want to sit? - Yeah, don't mind if I do. - May I offer you a piece of fruit cake? - I would love a piece of fruit cake. - If you don't like the raisins, you can just pick them out. - Gotcha. - [Peyton] Would you like some nut mug with your egg nog? - Don't you mean nutmeg? - Isn't it nut mug? 'Cause you just sprinkle it in your mug? - That does make more sense, doesn't it? Yes, yes, I would love some nut mug. Thank you. - Did you make this? It tastes just like grandma's. - Why thank you, darling. I sure did. - You and Grandee have the same stars on the top of your trees. - That's nice that you keep the tradition. - Ah, the Christmas tree just looks all wrong without it. - What's the tradition? - Well, when my mama and daddy got married, they didn't have any money to by store bought decorations on their first Christmas and mama, she cut a star out of a cereal box. She wrapped in tin foil. They kept that star for years. - We've had ours forever, right mama? - I made ours when your daddy and I got married. - And even when it wore out, instead of buying a new fancy tree topper, mama just made another tinfoil star and that's how the tradition was born. - I like having a tradition. Someday, I'm going to have a tinfoil star. - Me too. - Do you have any family traditions? - Yup, yup I do because my mom was Filipino and my dad's family was from Mexico, Mama wanted us to celebrate both of our family's cultures. Every Christmas we would celebrate with fairlitos. - What's fairlitos? - Well they're paper bags, it's a Filipino and Mexican tradition. You get to cut these pretty designs in them and then put a candle inside and then place them all along the walkway leading up to your house. For us, it was just a way to celebrate both of our cultures. - Can we make fairlitos? - [Farrah] I think I have some lunch bags in the pantry. - Well, get ready to see the master crafter and her proteges in action. [upbeat country music] [upbeat country music] [upbeat country music] - It's beautiful. - Isn't it? Sorry to duck out. I've got to head back to work, give Dina a break, but tonight was a lot of fun. - Yeah, the kids love this. Looks like we have a new family tradition. - I'm glad I got to share it. I haven't made fairlitos in years. I'm always too busy to even decorate. - I understand that kind of craziness. When you have kids, there's no taking Christmas off. - I bet. - Our first Christmas after Jake died, I was still kind of a mess. - I heard about your husband, I'm sorry Erin. - Thank you. Yeah, it was hard but I knew I needed to get it together for those girls and there's something about hanging lights and writing letters to Santa Claus that doesn't let you stay too sad. - That's true. - And I've learned to be pretty independent. - You like things that way? - Yeah, mostly but sometimes I think it would be nice to share it all with someone. I shouldn't keep you, I know you have to go to work. - Yeah. Will I see you again though? - Yeah. - See you soon. [subtle country music] [phone ringing] - Good morning Tessa, is everything okay? - [Tessa] Oh yes, I just called the brag on myself. - [Erin] What'd you do? - I stacked 50 coins today. - Good job. - [Tessa] I also called to check on you. - What for? - Well, I was just thinking about what you said about your daddy and I think you should call him for Christmas. - Well, believe it or not I'm staying here at dad's with the girls. - Well, how's it going? - It's good, it's a little weird. He's really trying, but it's hard for me. - I know. Sometimes you can be standing right next to someone and they still feel a million miles apart. If you could just push your heart open even a tiny crack, the light will start creeping in. - Yeah, I'm pushing, I promise. - Well if I can stack 50 coins, you can do it. - Merry Christmas Tessa. - Merry Christmas sweetheart. - Hey, what are you doing? - We're making snowmen pancakes. - With bacon scarves. - Cool. Do you want my help? - Nope. Just sit down and put your feet up. - Yeah, take a load off. - Can I have some more? I only grabbed two. - Morning darling. - I wanted to run something by you, dad. - What you thinking? - Well, I've been considering going back to school to get my PhD in occupational therapy. - What about your job? - I'd still be working, but it will let me specialize, maybe move into management, or I could even start teaching at some point, but it's a lot of time and so expensive. - Oh, you need money for school? - I wouldn't ask you for money - Farrah and I could pitch in. - Dad, I have the money saved for school. I just wanted to see what you thought. - Oh. - [Peyton] Breakfast is served. - Come on you two. These pancakes aren't going to eat themselves. [subtle music] Come on in here. - Now, you can put syrup but first you have to make it snow. - Dig in everybody. - Grandee, do you want some snow? - I do. You bet I do. [upbeat country music] [upbeat country music] - You're a little early for the lunch rush. - Oh, sorry. I can come back. - I'm just kidding, I'm Dina. - Hi, I'm Erin. - Well, nice to meet you. Mateo's in the kitchen. - I don't want to get in his way. - I don't think you have to worry about that at all. - Okay. Oh, thanks for running things yesterday so Mateo could come over. - Are you kidding? Thank you for having him think about something other than tamales for like an hour or two. Go save him from himself. - Okay, nice to meet you. - You too. - Dina, can you pass me a poblano? - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - Where did you learn to cook like that? - My grandma, she babysat me all the time. She said that if I was going to take up space in her kitchen that I needed to work. She started me off stirring the beans with his big old wooden spoon. I loved it. - I'm imagining you in a tiny little chef hat. - I never stopped cooking after that, Dina and I opened up a taco truck right after high school. We hustled and we hustled and we saved up enough to open up the storefront. The rest is history. - Wow, she's really nice. - Yeah. She's great, isn't she? - Yeah, honestly. Between the kids and work, I feel like I spend most of my time with little girls and folks who could be my grandparents. So it's nice to actually have a conversation with someone who might've graduated high school in the same decade as me. Oh, your bad shoulder? - Yeah, it only hits me once in a while. But when it does, it's a, it's a whopper. - Oh, here. Lay your hand flat on this. - Like that? - Yeah. - Are you gonna be cleaning? - Don't be a sassy patient, now slowly allow your arm to move forward bending at the waist. - Oh, oh, all right. I feel that. - Yeah, it's a good stretch for your rotator cuff, helps with range of motion. Do that everyday for a few minutes and it should help. - I think you fixed me. You fixed me. Thanks. - Yeah. You're gonna burn your peppers. - What? - Oh shoot. [laughter] - I should probably head out, but I actually came to ask you if you would like to come track reindeer with us today. - Track reindeer, you're gonna need to explain that to me. - It's this thing my dad's been doing since I was little. He goes out and makes reindeer tracks and throws glitter around and puts a tape recorder in the woods of jingle bells, stuff like that. Of course we never find any, but the looking part's fun. - I have work. - Yeah, right. Of course. - But I can, I can ask Dina to handle things for me again and we hire a couple of helpers this time of year. - Are you sure she wouldn't mind? - Yeah, she'd probably be happy to get rid of me. - Okay, well then I guess I'll see you in a little bit. - I'll be there. - Okay, okay. [upbeat country music] - Do you think we will see one? - I hope so, but I don't know. - I hope they're hungry. - Reindeer are always hungry. They need lots of calories to fly. - Did you ever find any reindeer? - I never saw any, but I heard their jingle bells. Oh, I forgot my scarf. Can you watch for when Mateo gets here? - Why do you think reindeer like reindeer food so much? - I don't know, maybe 'cause it's sparkly. - I missed seeing you today. - I was in and out. - Erin, listen about this morning. - Dad, it's fine. - No, it's not. It's not fine. You were upset. - I wasn't upset. I just wanted some advice. - Oh, okay. - Well, you went back to school and you worked full time. But I was little then, so I just wanted to know how you did it. - Well, you were with your mom a lot. - Right, so you don't think I can do it? - Well, I think you can do it. I think you can handle school. It'll be hard, but you've always accomplished everything that you set your mind to. - Mateo's here, let's go catch a reindeer. - Okay then. - [Mateo] Stick these in your pockets. Reindeer really like carrots. - Thank you. - Hi, I see you brought some reindeer feed. - Did my research. - Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. We best get going. Farrah's' going to stay here and keep an eye on the reindeer scanner for me. - Reindeer scanner? - Now the first thing you've got to know about tracking reindeer, is they love the scent of cookies. Go on, take one, go on. Mom? Rub that in real good, rub it in your hands. Get it in there really good. Oh yeah, reindeer can't resist that. - It's tradition. - Well, I ain't arguing with tradition, so. Let's go tracking. - All right, y'all ready to track some reindeer? - Yeah. - Let's go! [subtle country music] You hear that? - Jingle bells. - I can hear them too. - [Carter] I heard something. They might be in that bush. - Yeah. - Sprinkle a little reindeer feed and then we can hide behind the trees and see if any reindeer come out. - Yeah, but do it quietly. - So will you spend Christmas with your family? - No, Mom and dad are both gone. - I'm sorry. - It's all right, they gave me their house so kind of feels like they're still around. And my brother is all the way out in El Paso, so usually I spent Christmas over at Dina's house. - Oh really? - Yeah, she's got a huge family of 10 brothers and sisters. - Oh wow. 10. I'm not used to big Christmases. It's usually just me and my mom and the girls. - Do you ever consider expanding that list? - [Carter] Mateo! You have to come hide or the reindeer won't come. - Yeah, come over here! - Be right there. [subtle country music] [laughter] - Oh here, let me help you. - Thanks. - Okay, go wash your hands for dinner. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll have it next time. - [Carter] You better. - Sorry we didn't see any reindeer. - Maybe next year. - Is that an official commitment? - Now it is, yes. - Oh, I have something for you. - What's this? - I made you something. It's brownies, it's the only thing I know how to cook that doesn't come in a box. - Wow, well I consider myself honored. Oh my God, these smell amazing. - Don't ruin your dinner, also please don't try them in front of me in case you don't like them and that way I won't die of embarrassment. - Thank you. You still have some cookie crumb. - Oh my gosh. - All right, I got it, or I smashed it. - Thanks. [phone chimes] - Let me just. - Duty calls? - Yeah, tis the season. See you soon? - Yeah. Keep dancing. - Ha ha. [upbeat country music] [upbeat country music] - So how was the day with the girls? - It was good, we just picked up some firewood for the bonfire tonight. - Yeah, it's going to be a nice night. - You should call Mateo and ask him to come. - He's taken so much time off already. - Oh, come on. Something tells me he won't mind taking a little more. Have you seen the way he looks at you? - No. - I have known that boy for years and he's never come over for fruitcake and you know how good my fruit cake is. - That's a good point. Maybe I'll just drive up there and invite him in person. - Now you're talking. - Do you mind watching the girls? - Not a bit, there's plenty we can do. - Thanks. Wish me luck. - Good luck. - And your fruitcake is really good. I don't even like fruitcake. - Hm, I've really out done myself. [upbeat country music] - How can I help you ma'am? - Yeah, I'm looking for some burnt peppers, you got any of those? - Only for my special person list. - We're having a bonfire tonight, Farrah invited you. - I wish you were the one who was inviting me. - Well then I am officially asking you to attend our family holiday bonfire. - And I'm officially accepting. - I also realized I still haven't tried your tamales. - Right, we can remedy that right away. Meet me at our booth. - Hey. - Hey girl, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Awesome, thank you. Oh, I did try your brownies. It was a challenge to get even a little piece out of your Mateo's hand, but he did let me try them and they were delicious. - Thank you. - Nice to see you. - You too. - They were super delicious and they're also all gone. - What? I just gave them to you last night. - [Mateo] What can I say? I have a sweet tooth. Now, if you don't like this, we can not be friends. - Okay. We can definitely still be friends. What is this? - Chicken [speaking Spanish] tamale. It's my specialty, my mom's chicken and [speaking Spanish] recipe and my grandma's tamale. - It's so good. - You know, I bet your mom would be really proud of you still keeping both your traditions alive. - Yeah, well I hope to pass them on someday. - Dina doesn't mind me distracting you - Dina says that I don't take enough breaks. She thinks that I don't leave myself enough mental space to be creative and she's been pretty philosophical since starting yoga. - Well, you do work a lot. - That's what it takes to build the business. - Don't you have any hobbies or places you wanna see? - Yeah. Once in a while I like to go fishing and whatever we catch, we put it on the menu. - There's gotta be something you like that isn't work related. - I like you. - I like you too. - I also like two step. How about you? - Like every self respecting Texas girl. [upbeat country music] [phone ringing] - [Mom] You're lucky you caught me. Phil and I have been in the pool all day. - Any news? - Well, he proposed last night on the beach under the stars, it was like a movie. - Oh mom, I'm so happy for you. - So I guess we will be planning a spring wedding. Will you be my maid of honor? - Oh mom, of course I will. - I am so excited. Well we've been talking about me this whole time. What about you? - Well, don't get too excited but I think I may have met someone. - A man? - No, a unicorn. Yes, a man. He owns a restaurant in town and he's really nice. He's come over a few times and he's great with the girls. - Aw, good for you honey. Now I want details. - Well, that's all the details I have for now. - Fine. So how are things going with your dad? - Okay. - Well that doesn't sound very convincing. - Can I ask you a question, mom? - Yeah, anything. - Do you ever still get mad at dad? - Honey, I haven't spoken with your dad in years. - Well, I don't mean like a fight, I mean about the past. - Well, if I were to let myself think about it I might feel hurt but being mad about the past is such a waste of precious time. Now, if you're feeling guilty about spending Christmas with your dad, don't. - It's not that. - Oh honey, Phil is waving for me. I gotta go. - [Erin] I love you mom. - Oh, I love you sweetheart. Merry Christmas. [subtle music] [subtle music] - Your daddy calls this his love tree. - I didn't know he did this. - Oh yeah. He says he carves the names of all the people he loves on this tree because even if he can't be with them to watch them grow up or grow old, he can watch this tree grow big and strong and know that everything will be okay. - So sweet. - He couldn't love you or those girls more, or be more proud of you. Well, I better get back up to the house. I promised the girls we'd bedazzle some - Okay. - Smells like it's going to snow. - We never get snow here. What does snow smell like? - I can't describe it, but this nose is never wrong. [subtle music] - I'm up. - I didn't mean to wake you. - I can't sleep anyway. Thinking about Erin. - Just give her some time. - I just, I feel like everything I say is the wrong thing. She barely even looks at me. - Well, unfortunately there's not an expiration date on a broken heart. You're just going to have to be patient until Erin's ready. - I just, it just feels like I'm hanging myself out there like a punching bag. - Then let her punch it out. Erin's babies adore you and you have to do everything you can to stay in their and Erin's life. - What would I do without you? - Starve and never match your socks. [subtle country music] - Oh, can I have another one? - You already had five. - Two were s'mores and two were for my stomach. - Aren't they all for your stomach? - My stomach likes to mix things up. - Fair enough. - Hand one of those to your fella. - Dad, seriously? Here you go. - Thanks. - I'm telling you, sea salt, dark chocolate, perfect s'mores. - Well far be it for me to argue with the chef. - You know Erin, this is the best Christmas that I've had in a long time. - Me too.

Kinda, kinda felt like I was a part of the family. - Good. - So uh, am I gonna see you tomorrow at the Christmas Eve service? - Good. - Mom, how many lizards are leaping? - Um, 10. - I told you it was 10, Carter. - I'd better go referee. I have a feeling this could turn to a controversy. - Goodnight, see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow. [subtle music] [knocking] Girls, you can't come in, I'm doing secret stuff. - It's me. - Okay, come in quick. Do you like a challenge? - Erin, I've been wanting to talk to you about something. I'm sorry I wasn't around much, but I thought I was doing the right thing for you and your mom by being a good provider. I know the damage is done and well, maybe it's too late. - It's just hard for me, especially to watch you with the girls because when I was their age, you were always working and then when you and mom split up, I saw you even less. - Yeah, I missed a lot when you were little. - But it's not just when I was little, dad. You missed my high school graduation. - Well, I had to go to that conference and I told you that, you said you understood. - I just said that because I didn't know how to talk to you. It felt like you were a stranger. - A stranger? Erin, all I want is a chance to start again. - I know, but I've got a cut so deep, I don't think it's ever going to heal. - Do you want to heal, Erin? - What? - Do you want to heal it? - I can't do this. I thought I could handle spending Christmas here but, I can't. - [Gary] Erin, Erin, Erin doll. - This should be colored, maybe pink. - There's a little change of plans, girls. - What? - Well, mommy needs to go home so we're going to have to leave Grandee's house. - But it's Christmas Eve, we can't go. - And Farrah got us special outfits for the service tonight and she said the pastor said we could carry the baby Jesus to the manger. - [Carter] And I told Santa we would be here and he won't know where to take our presents. - Erin. - Okay, we can stay. But we need to leave first thing tomorrow morning, okay? - Okay, thank you. - Farrah, do you mind watching the girls? I'm just going to go for a drive. - Of course. - Thanks. - Erin. Erin, don't. - Gary, just give her some space. - Your mom is just going to go out and do some last minute Christmas shopping while we get these cinnamon rolls all ready. [subtle country music] - Go ahead. - Everything okay? Let's um, let's head over to the booth. - I'm so sorry, I know you're really busy. I just wanted to let you know that we're leaving tomorrow morning right after the girls wake up. - I thought you were staying through Christmas. You all right? - It's my dad, he and I don't communicate very well. I came out here this Christmas to see if I could fix that. - And it can't be fixed? - When I was little, my dad worked all the time, like all the time and I see him now with my girls and instead of appreciating the granddad he's become, it's like, I, like I'm jealous that he wasn't that kind of dad for me. - Look, I'm not trying to defend your dad, but I can at least tell you what it's like. I've sacrificed a lot in my life for this restaurant and that's the reason why I don't have a wife or a family. - Oh, yeah I understand. Yeah. - Here. - No, I'm really glad that you told me now rather than later. - Wait, wait, hold on a second. - Look, I don't want to be a distraction from your work. - That's not what I meant at all. - But it's what you said. - Hey Erin, hey wait up. - I got to go Dina, but it was so nice meeting you. - Look, sometimes that strong silent type thing that Mateo does comes across like he doesn't care, but he does. - He's still inside, isn't he? I mean, I'm leaving. - Give him a chance. - If there's one thing that I learned when I lost my husband, it's how it's foolish to waste a second of your time.
