Hey, Look! Catch. Are you nuts? Milishuka! Did you hear that? She's hungry. How do you know that? Louie, hold this. It's your turn today. Let me. You coward... Don't eat us. Keep us safe. We'll take care of you. Do you know how late it is? Where have you been? Where have you been? I should help my father pack. OK. Dad, are we at war? – Take care of your mom, OK? – Of course. Don't fool around. I'm counting on you. All possibilities are on the table, including a renewed ground assault and simultaneous air strikes. We are aware of the huge responsibility we took upon ourselves. We are putting to use all our military and political experience. We set our path and we walk along it... ..and with everything that is going on around you, Roi. Try to keep safe over there, at the border. Thank you. We are going on a short break. We'll be right back... The IDF is heading to an extensive action, following this event. What does it mean regarding the conclusions of the IDF inquiries? At this time, the IDF operates like an army preparing for war. This time, it won't restrain itself. I believe we are about to see a strong Israeli action following what had happened... Honey! Are you alright? I'll call your mom, one second. Run! Jacky is coming! He'll kill you! Catch them! What do you want from him? Get in the car, you idiot! Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. You're dead. What are you going to do? I don't give a shit. I'll stay at the camp until my father comes back from the war. Hey Chemi! – Look, I've replaced the spring. – Not now. Are you coming with us? Chemi, look, I've fixed it. You think this is fixed? It's totally crooked! Where are my cigarettes? She wouldn't sell them to me. – No! Give it back! – What's this? Give it back! Stop it! Give it back! I want to save it for later. Give it back! Stop it. Stop it. Sit down. Look. Good morning my beauty. Enjoy. Are you serious? You want me to bring you cookies? Or maybe a girl to suck your dick? What are you doing, are you crazy? What's wrong with you? You think people can't see the smoke? There's nobody here! We are not at summer camp, so no campfires, got it? – Next thing you'll tell me we can't smoke here. – No. It's not the same. Next time you pull something like that you'll be walking home. Got it? Motherfucker. Fucking asshole. Fuck! I can't believe it. Don't worry, I have three whole packs in my bag. Now I remember why I brought you along. Tell me, did you eat the halva last night? Oh, the officer's beautiful secretary... – With her hair down to her nipple... – Omer, Omer! It's OK that you sing, but do it quietly. Got it? You really should have been an officer... – Captain Yaron. – Shut up already. Are you insane? Do you want to burn the place down? You are such a tight ass. You make me sick. Give me the toilet paper. Here you go. Yaron! Need me to wipe your ass? Let's go. I've got a lot of stuff there. Where is Louie? I saw him. He went into the camp. Maybe the soldiers caught him. He shouldn't have gone without us. Louie! What have you got there? Did you steal their cigarettes? Is it real? Where did you find it? – Inside the camp. – It's a 9mm Glock. Do you think it's loaded? – I'll show you. – Don't touch it! Push the button on the right side. My father has the same gun. – Give it back! – It's loaded. – Give it back! – Then give me the gun. – It's mine. – Then you're not getting it. Don't touch! I'm first, then you. Jacky... You're dead! Wanna try? War!!! Nice jugs! Can I? You want to take a look? This gun is broken. It's not working. Let me show you. Give it to me! They saw us! Where is it? Where is the gun? Leave her alone. What do we have here? Did you steal the gun? This is our camp. So everything here is yours? Chemi, look out! What a cute kid... A real sweetheart. Hand him over. What are you talking about?! Let me enjoy a little. Let him go, Omer! Son of a bitch! Did you steal the gun? Give me the gun. You think this is a game? You think this is a game? Damn kid. Did you see that? Come here! Omer let him go, he's just a kid. What are we going to do with them? Kids, do you want me to take you to the police? Do you? Then I want you out of here for good. Got it? You got it, kid?! And don't tell anyone you saw us here. We're on a secret mission. One word out of you, we'll tell the police what you did. Let's go. Why did you give them my gun? Now Jacky will kill me for sure. Chemi? – Do you want to come to my place? – Not today. – Are you sure? – Yes I'm sure. OK. Bye. Hi, Mom. Where have you been? At Chemi's house. Go have dinner. But first take a shower. Did Dad call? No. Last night, I suggested we should no longer limit the IDF operation. We should go forward to the highest level, loosen most of the restrictions, and hit them even harder. We hit many targets, we destroyed infrastructure, we hit militants, and we will continue to the next phase – the ground operation. We have many ground forces, accompanied by massive support of the Air Force, the Navy, and a wide–scale support from the Intelligence Corps. We are operating against infrastructures and terrorists. Naturally, I can't reveal the details of this operation. Eventually, they achieved a certain deterrence, a short period of quiet, I would say, a period of time which gets shorter and shorter. We have to understand. The reality is that they are not getting weaker. Contrary to prior expectations, they are not getting weaker. They are only deterred to a certain extent. Let's hear what the prime minister said following the cabinet meeting today. So far, the operation is progressing as planned... Omer, sit down. We're almost home. Stop messing around. – Who's messing around? – You are. Are you OK? I didn't speak with her yet. If you need a place to crash, you can stay at my place. We'll find you a place. Thank you. My pleasure. We've got a doghouse, the dog wouldn't mind cuddling with you for a few days. The truth is, I'm not sure she'll have me back after all this mess. And what about me? For once I thought someone in my family would finish what he started. My mother will be so disappointed. But you can't say we didn't try. We tried. If we didn't have this fucking lieutenant, I wouldn't have had any problem. Fuck it all. We'll be free now. I don't care. No... I can't believe this is happening to me. I know him since we were 5 years old. If he says that he'll come in 2 days, he will. Do you really think I can stay here with you for another two days? – I'm telling you, he'll come for us. – OK. Turn off your mobile and get up. Omer, what are you doing? – Nothing. – I told you to come. Let go of me. Son of a bitch. What did you say? – Son of a bitch. – Shut the fuck up. I'll kill you. – Impotent. – Shut your mouth. We caught him. At Hachashmonaim Park. Shut up. You're spitting on me? What did you do to him? Let his brother take care of him. The thing I hate most in the army is this disgusting food. Do you remember Maymon? How he tried to be a chef? He really put his heart into it. He made us scrambled eggs with herbs every morning. He brought green onions. It was a good time for me, back then. I used to ask them to put me on kitchen duties all the time. Just give me kitchen duties. The officers didn't mind. They couldn't stand my whining anyway. And then Maymon, this idiot, made this damn shakshuka. The whole base was sick with diarrhea. They closed down the kitchen and sent me back to the field. No more kitchen duties and no more Maymon's cooking. Four months of these stinking rations. I wanted to die. Omer, Omer. Don't eat it all. Leave me some. What do you want, it was half empty. What are you talking about? I saw you open a new one. It's just a little one. There must be another one. No, there isn't another one. Throw me the rest of the corn. Are you serious, what's wrong with you? We're stuck here because of your friend, and now you're eating all the food. What do you want from me? I'm starving! What's wrong? Tell me something, are you stupid? What? Did you finish an entire field ration by yourself? – No way. – Don't lie to me! You fucking... Don't ever touch me again, you hear me? Do you hear me? Motherfucker! You make me sick... Do you have an extra shirt? Hey! What are you doing? Kid, stop! Come here! Stop! Stop, you son of a bitch! Haven't we told you not to fuck with us? It's you? You did this, you motherfucker! Yaron! Enough with the ball already, you're driving me crazy. Dvir, did you tell him about it? What are you talking about? Stop being such a wuss, so you went on a date, no big deal. For such an ugly boy it's a big deal. As if you've ever been with a girl, Jacky... I've been with a lot of girls. You mean with that bitch, Sharon Rosenfeld? No... With your mother! Motherfucker! I'll kill you, you're dead! Mom, look how nice Tali is drawing. That's great, girls. Keep it up. Get us some ice cream. Where is he? – What are you doing? – Drinking. What is that awful smell? Shut the fuck up! You didn't see him? Where is he hiding? He's not here. I've seen you hanging with him and his friends. Can I help you, Jacob? Do you have chocolate ice cream? Do you want me to call your mother? If you see him, tell him he's dead. What's this about? I don't know. He just came in here. Why are you hanging around with his stupid brother, anyway? I'm not. Yesterday I came to visit you and you weren't at home. I wasn't home. So where were you? I went with my mom to lay flowers on my father's grave. Sweetie, your father was a real hero. "Victory to the IDF" Louie. Hello. Is Tali here? No. She's with her friends. Thanks. Chemi! Come here! – I'm really sorry. – You're crazy! What are you doing? Hey, Chemi. You alright? Yes, I'm good. You have to see what I've made. Don't point it at my eyes! Check it out. Come on, it's off. With the laser it's much better now. Are you a child? It's just a toy. We need the gun. That's the only way to get rid of them. They'll catch you again. They won't. I've got a plan. Are you coming? – I thought we'll go shoot with it. – And then what? Come on, let's go. Do you have any meat? I couldn't go back to sleep. I feel exhausted. Mom, I'm going out for a little while. Wait a second. Were to? To the mall. The mall? Yes. OK. There's 50 shekels on the table, take it. – Thanks, Mom. – Don't get back late. Yes... – What's that? – You stink. I didn't have anything else. His girlfriend is beautiful. Looks good on me? Yes. "I miss you. My love. Liat." What are you doing? We've agreed that we wouldn't call anyone, you idiot. You almost broke it, you asshole! Fuck this. I've had enough of your tantrums. Omer, you're like a little boy. You do realize that without me they would've caught you already, right? Whatever you say... That's right. That's what we've agreed to, Omer, that what I say is what we do, or you don't come with me. After we're out of here I don't want to see you ever again. It's no wonder you were expelled from the officers' academy. You're fucking insane! What did you say? You son of a bitch! You think you're a man, hitting me when I'm down? Just wait, I'll get better and then you're dead! – Hush... – Don't hush me! Fuck! – So what? So I farted, so what? So kill me. – It's not your stench. Shut up! What is it? – What the hell is it? – Stay here and guard our gear. – What? – Can you please stop arguing with me? What is it, Yaron? What are you doing here? Get the hell out of here. Go back! OK, I get what you're doing. Come out, I just want to talk to you. Drop it. You're going to shoot me now? Go ahead, pull the trigger. Let me go. Let me go. Do it gently, Yaron. Why did you have to steal that fucking gun from Dadon? Did you forget there's a war going on? It's for self–protection. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Yes, really... I've had enough, Yaron. I want to go home. Don't you remember that it's because of your fucking friend that we're stuck here? This fucking kid. OK, relax, hold this here and shut up. Fine? Where is the gun? Blondie, where is the gun? I told you, he threw it down the well. It stinks! Kid. Come here. Hey kid! Come here for a second. I need you to do something for me. I need you to bring back what you threw in there. You want to go back home, don't you? Then get the gun. You know because you shot this idiot, I can turn you over to the police, right? But you want to go home. – Then get up already and get the gun! – Let me go! Get up! Let me go! Come! Come here! – Go down! – Stop it! Go down! Down! Down! Kid! Kid! Kid! – You killed him, you asshole. – Shut up already! Let's get out of this place already. Let's leave. Yaron... Kid! Hello Chemi, what's up? How's the wife, the kids? Look at your face. Nobody taught you how to eat properly? Tell me... Where is my brother hiding? My mother is worried sick about him, you see? Where is he? Just tell me where he is and we're done. I don't know. Just look at how they are all staring at you. With Pity. You know why? Because you're trash. Where is he? I'll fuck you up. I've warned you. I'll kill you and your mother! Where is he? He's at the old abandoned military base. Are you sure? Yes. Alright. You believe him? Yes. I have trust in people. Alright, thank you. We'll be in touch later, OK? Hey Chemi, what are you doing here? You son of a bitch! You were hiding here the whole time. Are you crazy?! Leave me alone! Stop it already, let go of me! Tali, come here! What's going on? Tali! What was that all about? Kid! Blondie! Blondie! My love. I know... I know. I love you. Wait a second... I have to go. I love you too. You used my cell phone? Your friend said he'll pick us up at 12. What time is it? It's almost 10. We're going? We're going? Kid! Kid! Something happened to him. I'm telling you. Blondie! Maybe he's dead? Shut up, Omer, please shut up. You've killed him, you moron. Kid! Let's leave this place already! I need a doctor. Omer, if you want, just leave. Kid! I'm leaving. Blondie! Blondie! Kid... What happened to your arm? This? It's nothing. Are you in pain? You're bleeding. Yes. It's very painful. Take a look. Why did you come here? – Leave her alone. – I didn't touch her. I just want to open the water valve, but my arm hurts. I'm really thirsty, kid, can you please help me? Look at him. He's a wreck. Where is Yonatan? Who do you mean? The little guy? Kid, please help me open the water valve, I must drink. I asked you where he is. He's over there. Let him go, now! Of course. Just help me open the water valve. I'm dying of thirst, I have to drink. First you let him go. OK. We'll let him go. Relax... What the hell? Ok. Be careful with that. OK. Be careful with that. The kids are here. They want their friend back. Well? I'm not going anywhere without the gun. What do you want, to spend the rest of your life in prison? Let's get the hell out of here. Where to? Anyone want some Halva? Where is Yonatan? What do you mean? We let him go long ago. He must be home by now. Who do you think we are? What do you think we did to him? I know exactly what you are. You do? You ran away from the war. You cowards! Kid, you don't really think you're scaring me with your worthless little crossbow. You don't want to cry again like a little girl, do you? What are you going to do? Shoot us? Deserter... I'm warning you! If you don't leave, we'll call the police. I see. Omer! Say goodbye to the kids. Milishuka! What was that? Milishuka answered me. Did you hear that? It's Yonatan! Yonatan? Yonatan, are you okay? Come... Are you okay? Did you see her? – I did. – And she didn't eat you? What did you do down there? It's incredible! She gave this to me. She said she's hungry. Very hungry. Keep quiet! – I'm in pain! – Just keep quiet. Yaron, that's it. – Let's leave. – I'm not going. – I'm serious! – I'm also serious. Blondie... Did you have fun down there? We can finally leave this shithole! Finally! You're a shitty kid! Omer, try to keep up. Yaron... Yaron... What is it now? I must drink. I'm dying here. We're not stopping now. We'll be late. Come! I can't take it anymore. You've got to help me, man. Motherfuckers! What? There's no water. I told you we shouldn't have stopped. Let's go. What do you mean there's no water? Son of a bitch! It's all your fault. My fault? You should have taken me to the doctor's yesterday. So we would have sat in jail for a week, so what?! That's it. I've had it with you, Omer. I'm out of here. You can rot here for all I care. – He won't take you if I'm not there! – Fuck it! We're late anyway. Captain Yaron, huh? You're leaving a wounded soldier behind? You call yourself a soldier, you worthless piece of shit! Omer, it was a mistake taking you with me. Now I understand those officers that you claim were trying to screw you over. No, no one is trying to screw you over. You're just a piece of shit and don't let anybody tell you otherwise. You hear me? Got it? Go fuck yourself! With pleasure. Yaron, you can't leave me here, you asshole! Yaron! Yaron! Yaron, don't be an asshole! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Mom... Leave me alone! What do you want from me? You want to die today, kid? Motherfuckers... Look after us. Don't eat us. We'll take care of you. Look out!
