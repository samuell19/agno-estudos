Toei Company Ltd Presents Here's twenty million yen. They were both our accountants at our headquarters. They got us in trouble, making the police suspicious. Rio Grandol embezzled our gold Buddha from Thailand. He is about to fly to Australia. But first, we want Ryo Gentoku. He's been grilled at the police headquarters since the arrest. We don't want him to talk. Tsurugi, we desperately need your help. Do it however you like. He's with External Affairs, interrogation room number eight. Double the fee, or I'm not in. OK, it's a deal. There he is! Hey! Who are you? Embassy. Hey! Come out! You must be somebody. What's your speciality, karate? Interrogation room number eight. Ryo Gentoku! There's no use being obstinate. Seibukan School, eh? Shit! Hey! Hey! His vocal cords are... Irrevocably damaged. Get the doctor. Hurry! Hurry! OK. This one. Finished? One more to go. Rio Grandol. When will you get him? I'll finish my job as soon as possible. But more hurry less speed, you know. The important thing is to get the gold Buddha back. About this case... You took it upon yourself at the Seibukan request. So I know how you feel, but... We aren't free individuals. We belong to the force. I know, but... It was all my fault, sir. He got our witness right before my eyes! Let me work at it full time, please. No, Yamagami. Alright, then... I know I'm being selfish, but this is my resignation. Speaking. You located Rio Grandol? OK, get ready immediately. Will the flight for Melbourne take off on time? Are you sure? Wait! Drop the gun! Who are you? This statuette is famous in Thailand. Pure gold, huh? What's it worth, I wonder? Stupid! It's as good a national treasure. So it's priceless. Thank god Rio Grandol didn't take it away. We need it to fund our martial arts center. How did the police find out? I allowed the two men to handle too much money. But I sense an informer. It was probably Masaoka from the Seibukan School. Masaoka? Among his pupils is... Sergeant Yamagami. The Seibukan men are dangerous. Ready! Steady... go! I can't do it, father. Your soul is not ready. Make your mind a total blank. You are still preoccupied. - Try again. - Yes, sir! I'll try again. Don't tell me they fired you. To repair my error. And after some argument they laid me off. I consider it permission to go ahead in my own way. Just like you. Look. Otaguro eliminated the two men we'd marked. I think it proves the importance of his scheme. The Asian martial arts center, that is. He's already raised more than five billion yen from Asian countries. That much? And I think he has a 'big brother' supporting him. What do you mean? I mean the mafia is behind him. The police have been working on FBI information. But no evidence so far. If that's really the case, it's awful for our nation. Kono! Kono! Send word to all our Asian chapters. To investigate the way Otaguro raises money. If there's anything dodgy, have withesses come to Japan, immediately. Yes, sir. By the way, I want to know more about Tsurugi. Tsurugi? Where does he come in? No ordinary man could've done what was done to the two men. Damaging the vocal cords with fingers. The way he acted with his hands shackled. It reminded me of Takuma Tsurugi. If it's him, you have a dangerous enemy, Yamagami. He is a genius. I fought him once. I met his late father while we were in China, through karate. Mr. Yamagami, give me a lesson. Hello, Kazuko. You must be making progress. Your eyes are shining. Alright, I'll give you a work out. That's it, Kazuko. - Please! - OK! You really are good. Otaguro. I've come as a fellow karate man to give you advice... Or rather a break, a chance to think it over. I'm shocked to hear those words from you, Masaoka. I also believe in Bushido. How would I do such a thing? I wish you weren't. But the police investigations... Wait. Look at that. Construction will start very soon. I'm absolutely on the level. If this can't convince you, nothing can. Otaguro. I had a good reason to say what I just said to you. Really? If you refuse to reconsider, we'll have to meet again. I've been expecting you. No wonder he's the number one in the Arabic countries. This is the plan. What I want to know is the actual dates of construction. For various reasons, I can't give the dates yet. How about the cost? Who authorized you to ask such things? Do you have a warrant? If not, forget it. Our guest is leaving. Do something! Stop it. Stop! Stop... You've given me an idea of what you are up to. Who needs music for training? I love this song. It always takes me back to Okinawa. I have no parents back home. Just their graves. Still, it's my home. Cut those Okinawa things out! Such harsh words... But I won't say anything back to you. If you hadn't picked me up when I was starving, where would I be? I owe you a lot. Ouch! Tsurugi. Kitajima Station. South entrance. Go now. Kitajima Station. South entrance. Understand? Hear that? It said now. To Mr. Tsurugi Who's this from??? How do you know me? What was he like? Kill Kendo Masaoka. Takuma! Are you afraid of Masaoka? Say what you like. I just can't. You've got to. Ridiculous. You can't control me just because you pay me. You ought to know where you stand. It's no use threatening me. You know that I'm not part of your team anyway. Well? His role is over. He knows too much. He knows too much. Knows too much. Tell me why. Why turn him down? I'm also a human being. Masaoka is the only man who understands me. For that they'll kill you. Then you're wasting your life. This cold gets me. What made you come here, anyway? We still have time. Let's go back to Tokyo. Takuma! Are you hurt? You are! Takuma! Takuma! You've got quite a physique. An athlete? Ping pong? Badminton? Anyway, I do karate a bit. I've got to Fourth Dan. Fourth Dan. Did you hear me? It's a great thing, karate. It has oriental mystique. Defense can be offense. The master told me, there's nothing to be afraid of except starvation. So I ate too much, and I keep gaining weight. My chop can reverse the heart, like this! It's so powerful it turns the heart upside down. Hey, take a look at this. This is "matsuba kuzushi". My throat hurts a little in here, though. And would you believe? I can break a rock. How embarrassing. Heat does harm to karate chops. You'd better remember that. We karate fighters call it a burn. Do you? Don't worry. I can still do some damage. For instance... I've got to Fourth Dan! This is the head of the Rangoon chapter. One night he disappeared. A week later he was found dead in the harbor. I remember him. A devoted man. It turned out that he was eliminated by the mafia. We found this in his desk. A one hundred thousand dollar donation was demanded. By Otaguro. A threatening letter. In New Delhi, three men were forced to make contributions. One of them had to give up his jewels. Now we have enough evidence to question Otaguro thoroughly. Takuma, wait! Not the mafia again. I wanted peace tonight. Did the mafia send you as well? No, Takuma, don't go! It's dangerous. Takuma! Takuma! Takuma! You can't go! Shikenbaru... Yes, it's me, Shikenbaru. Stab us! Together! I thought you were dead. Not until I kill you, Tsurugi. I'll live to see that day. This is the age of advanced medical developments. Even a heart can be transplanted. If you have the will to live and enough money, they can give you artificial vocal cords. Certainly the mafia sent me to get you. But remember, even if they hadn't, I'd do it myself. Because I survived so that I could kill you. Come, Tsurugi. Some place where nobody will get in. Takuma! Takuma... Takuma! This is an insult. You called me here only to incriminate me. It shows how much you want me out of the martial arts world! Good day! Wait. We have concrete evidence. - Kono! - Yes! Meet Mr. Ken Mao from Rangoon. And Mr. Gorasing, New Delhi chapter. You've been demanding donations under the pretext of building the Asian martial arts center. You blackmail wealthy people. You even rob those who are short of cash, taking their expensive statuettes or jewels. Those who are reluctant are got rid of by assassins. We even have the threatening letters you wrote to them. Not only that. According to Yamagami's report you have no intention of building the center at all. False site. False plans. The billions of yen you raised were sent to the states. Nol That's not true. Your school is the Japanese front for the mafia. Isn't it? You collected as much as you could in Asian countries and contributed to their vaults. But not any more. I could report it to the police. But I haven't. As a fellow martial arts master, I'm giving you a chance to decide what to do. We're in trouble. Yes, I know. Otaguro, to the mafia, your mistake is unforgivable. Now I'm going to be in direct charge here. We don't need you anymore. - Imura. - Yes. Let's have a toast. Cheers! Please start. What is it? Yamagami! Yamagami! Yamagami... Takuma... You're alive, Takuma! Takuma! Takuma! Takuma, come on! Wake up! Takuma! Takuma! Soldier! Soldiers, please! Listen to me! Shut up! Daddy isn't a spy. Let him go. Please. Brat! You are the son of a traitor. Get lost. Daddy! Daddy... Takuma. Don't trust anybody. Be your own man. You are the only one you can turn to. Train yourself, body and mind. Don't let anybody get the better of you. Takuma. Do you recognize me? Takuma... you've been almost dead for three days. Have some. You've been with me for three days? Oh, it's nothing. You've got to get out of Tokyo. And you? Don't worry about me. They never spare a traitor, the mafia. So you knew about me. That voice on the tape. You couldn't fix that up yourself. I'm sorry. As a matter of fact, I have been watching you for the mafia. What I said about Okinawa was true, though. I have no mother or father, that's the truth, too. But... What I never said was that they'd made me cultivate you. Do whatever you want with me. What I want to do is... To get Otaguro for Masaoka. Otaguro's been killed. So has Yamagami. - What? - They hurt master Masaoka. His school is finished. Are you sure? You are a genius. The damned mafia! Let me go! Stop! Go! Boke... Bokel. Tsurugi... Tsurugi... Run... Run away, quick! What a rotten shame. Where are they? Tsurugi. I knew you'd come. She finally talked about you surviving. And here you are. So you're the boss. I'm not big enough to be called a boss. I'm Don Costello, head of the far east headquarters. Don Costello? She paid for it. I'll tell you something. We intended to... Control the whole Asian karate world. But you and Masaoka tried to stop us. I'm sorry. You have to die. You asked for it. Wait. Let me kill him. That particular man. I'll kill him. This time. OK. Tsurugi. Are you ready? Alright. Tsurugi, come on. Kill him! Get him!
