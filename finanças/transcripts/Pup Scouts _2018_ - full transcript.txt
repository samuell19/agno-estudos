Piper, Boobear, it's time for the annual Pup Scouts of the World contest, where teams compete for the chance to win the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and all the bones you can eat for a year. Your job is to chase, fetch and report all there is to know about dogs, puppies, and everything in between. You will travel all over the world, across time, space and beyond. You must keep your nose to the wind, your ears perked, and your paws to the wheel at all times. We depend on you to do the best job possible. Are you ready for your first assignment? Tail wiggling. Ears flappin'. Pup Scouts are ready for the chase, General Hot Dog. This is sure to be a challenging mission, little ones. Succulent wishbones! I love challenging missions. Slappin' tails, me too! I'm sending you two on a mission to learn about the evolution of dogs! The evolution of dogs? - How cool! - Can't wait! It's up to you to learn all about it, and report back to me with what you've discovered. Sweet barbecue sauce! This is going to be an incredible adventure! What can you tell us about evolution, General Hot Dog? Evolution is the process that allows an organism to develop and diversify from earlier life forms. You see, us dogs have not always looked like we do today. We have evolved over time. Wow! I can't wait to find out more! The evolution of dogs sounds so interesting! As you know, Boobear and Piper, to win the annual Pup Scouts of the World, you must find out and learn tons of amazing facts about dogs. We will. Awesome! You must also know there is a question that all the brightest canine minds all over the world have not been able to answer about the evolution of dogs. We need you two Pup Scouts to help us answer the "what the woof" question about the evolution of dogs. "What the woof" question? How cool. What is the question? What is the most ancient breed of dogs in existence today? That's a great question, General Hot Dog. Yes, General Hot Dog, we'll sniff out the answer in the wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see. I will assign you the best Pup Scout helper in the world: Scuzzy Bot. He's a robotic encyclopedia of canine knowledge. He will assist you on your mission. Scuzzy Bot! We love Scuzzy Bot! Be sure to ask a lot of questions, Pup Scouts. You have a prestigious Smartest Pooch award to win... and all the bones you can eat for a year! Have an amazing adventure, you two. All right! Pup Scouts... Hurray! Pup Scouts! Ready to get started on your next adventure? Super ready. Is a Frisbee ready to fly? Remember, Pup Scouts, any and all questions you have, I'm here to answer them. Where do we begin? Six million years ago, the Earth's climate was getting gradually colder. This is what eventually led to the glaciations of the Pliocene and the Pleistocene. This was also known as the Ice Age. Sweet pork chops! That's amazing! I'll be a kitty cat. I didn't know that. Now, look down there. That's the southern part of North America, today's southwestern United States and Mexico, six million years ago. There is where small woodland foxes started getting a lot larger and faster. By the late Miocene, about five million years ago, the first ancestors of coyotes, wolves, and domestic dogs had emerged. All members of this family, which also includes modern-day jackals, hyenas and foxes, are known as canids. Incredible! Hit my puppy brain with more incredible facts, Scuzzy Bot. From America, a group of canids made their way into Europe and Asia. The first canids were small- to medium-sized meat eaters, but they were not the top predators wolves are today. But all that was about to change with the emergence of a large creature the size of a wolf around three to four million years ago. Totally rip-tastic! Now, Boobear and Piper, the mighty wolf as we know them today didn't appear until much later... 800 thousand years ago, in modern-day Alaska. The time period is known as the Middle Pleistocene. Amazing! Did dogs evolve from wolves? Great question, Boobear. The answer is yes. And no. You see, Pup Scouts, although dogs are of the same species as modern wolves, they did not evolve from the wolves you see today. It is believed that dogs have evolved from a wolf species which is now extinct. Whoa! Cool factoid. How did they know that? One way to learn about evolution is to use DNA. What is DNA, Scuzzy Bot? DNA is short for... deoxyribonucleic acid. I know. It's a mouthful, isn't it? DNA is a thin molecule in the shape of a winding curved ladder made up of nucleotides. Animal bodies are made of cells, and DNA is a complicated and pretty cool mechanism that tells cells what to do. In other words, the cells of your body take orders from DNA, just like young dogs take orders from the alpha dog of the pack. Without the directions of the alpha dog, younger dogs wouldn't know how to behave. That's the same relationship cells and DNA have. When did the first dogs appear, Scuzzy Bot? Excellent question, Boobear. Dogs have separated from their wolf ancestors over 30,000 years ago. The earliest known fossil of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago and was found in what is today's Belgium. So dogs and modern-day wolves don't have anything in common, Scuzzy Bot. Very good observation, Boobear. Seems as if it would be so, but it is not. There has been, throughout time, mixing of dogs with modern-day wolves. So even if dogs don't descend from modern-day wolves, they have mixed with them in the very recent past. All this makes it very difficult for scientists to pinpoint the exact origin of dogs. Can they tell us when dogs become man's best friend? They can approximate when that happened by using archeological evidence. Whoa! Archeological evidence? What is that? Archeology is the study of the past based not on written evidence, such as books or ancient writing, but on physical evidence. Most of the archeological evidence comes from digging in the ground for ancient bones or artifacts. Digging? I'm an ace at digging, especially for delicious bones! Follow me, Pup Scouts. Let's head to the site where the first domesticated dog was discovered. Whoo-hoo! Yay-hay-hay-hay! Here we are, Pup Scouts. Below us is Germany. It was here that the skeleton of a domesticated dog was found. Its DNA identifies it as Canis lupus familiarus, which is the fancy name for... dog! The remains date to around 13,000 to 14,000 years ago, and he was one of the earliest examples of man's best friend. How do we know? We know because his skeleton was found in the same burial site as a man and a woman, so he was a domesticated, and possibly well-loved family dog. Where else were ancient dogs found, Scuzzy Bot? Let's see. Uh, remains of Canis lupus familiarus were found in Iraq, China, Siberia and Denmark. Were they all domesticated dogs? It's hard to tell with all of them, although when dogs are found in human burial grounds, it's a good indication that their lives and that of humans have become very close. There are examples in the Baikal region in modern-day Russia of dogs' ceremonial burials. Archeologists have found dogs buried lying on their right side and facing towards the east, just like humans. Some dogs were even buried with artifacts, like stone and bone carvings. Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit. That's incredible! Did all those ancient dogs look the same? That's a great question, Piper! The answer is, probably not. There is evidence that multiple breeds of primitive dogs existed. Many earlier forms of domesticated dogs went extinct and were replaced by other primitive dogs. All these dogs had different coat lengths and color, and even their faces and muzzles were different. Sweet barbecue bones! I had no idea. What about breeds? When did people begin to create all the dog breeds we see today? Excellent question, Piper. I see you're paying close attention. The process of breeding dogs to look like some of the breeds we see today has been a long one, probably dating back thousands of years since prehistoric times. Why did people breed dogs to look so different from each other? Normally, dogs are bred to make sure certain traits that people like about them are produced, like size, color, temperament and shape. For example, livestock guardian dogs were bred more than 2,000 years ago to protect flocks or herds of domesticated animals, like sheep. Whoa! Beagle brain blast! - That's incredible! - I have a question. What's the most ancient dog breed, Scuzzy Bot? It's believe the most ancient dog breed in existence today is the New Guinea Highland Wild Dog. They were believed to have gone extinct, but a pack of healthy and happy New Guinea highland wild dogs have been discovered recently in the highest island mountain peak in the world: the summit of Mount Carstensz in New Guinea. Hey, Piper, I think we just found the answer to General Hot Dog's "what the woof" question. You're right, Boobear. The most ancient dog breed in existence today is the New Guinea highland wild dog. Congratulations on finding the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question, Pup Scouts. General Hot Dog will be proud of you. No bones about it. Fantastic work, Pup Scouts. Your mission was a great success. You're well on your way to winning the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and all the bones you can eat for a year! Tail-waggin' awesome! Say, were you able to find the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question? Yes, General Hot Dog. We sure did. The most ancient dog breed in existence today is the New Guinea highland wild dog. They were believed to have gone extinct, but a pack of New Guinea highland wild dogs have been recently discovered. That's great! Ha! Good job, Pup Scouts! What's our next mission, General Hot Dog? Your next mission is going to be your most awesome yet. We want you to learn about... puppies! Puppies? Wow! Cool! I'll be a bacon strip! Can't wait to get started. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Greetings, Pup Scouts. Hey, General Hot Dog. Hey, General Hot Dog. Piper, Boobear, it's time for the annual Pup Scouts of the World contest, where teams compete for the chance to win the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and all the bones you can eat for a year. Your job is to chase, fetch and report all there is to know about dogs, puppies, and everything in between. You will travel all over the world, across time, space and beyond. You must keep your nose to the wind, your ears perked, and your paws to the wheel at all times. We depend on you to do the best job possible. Are you ready for your first assignment? Tail wiggling.

I'm sending you two on a mission to learn all about puppies! Puppies! How cool! Can't wait! It's up to you to learn all about it and report back to me with what you've discovered. That's cooler than a cooled T-bone. This is going to be an incredible adventure! What can you tell us about puppies, General Hot Dog? Well, Piper, a puppy is a juvenile dog. At birth, puppies can weigh anywhere from less than a pound up to about 23 pounds for larger breeds. Dogs give birth to multiple offspring, and puppies are born in groups of anywhere from three to eight. They call these groups of newborns "litters." Puppies also don't waste time, and they grow up fast. Other changes can also occur as they grow, like changes in fur color. Wow! I can't wait to find out more! Puppies sound so interesting. As you know, Boobear and Piper, to win the annual Pup Scouts of the World, you must find out and learn tons of amazing facts about dogs. Yes, General Hot Dog. We will. Awesome! Ha! You must also know there is a question that all the brightest canine minds all over the world have not been able to answer about puppies. We need you two Pup Scouts to help us answer the "what the woof" question about puppies. "What the woof" question? How cool! What is the question? I'm glad you asked, Piper. This time, the "what the woof" question is, "What was the largest litter of puppies ever born?" That's a great question, General Hot Dog. We'll sniff out the answer in the wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see. I will assign you the best Pup Scout helper in the world: Scuzzy Bot. He's a robotic encyclopedia of canine knowledge. He will assist you on your mission. Scuzzy Bot! We love Scuzzy Bot! Be sure to ask a lot of questions, Pup Scouts. You have a prestigious Smartest Pooch award to win, and all the bones you can eat for a year! Have an amazing adventure, you two. All right! Pup Scouts... Hurray! Pup Scouts, ready to get started on your next adventure? - Super ready! - Ha, ha! Is a Frisbee ready to fly? Remember, Pup Scouts, any and all questions you have, - I'm here to answer them. - Where do we begin? Let's begin with all the ways in which puppies are born all over the world, shall we? Down there is the United States of America. Let's go check out some puppies who live there. Some puppies get lucky and are born into good homes with families who are interested in breeding their animals. This is one of the best ways to introduce a little puppy into the world... surrounded by loving people and a support system for the big learning curve that comes with being born. Puppies grow fast and can achieve full-grown height and weight in just a few weeks, depending upon their breed. Sweet pork chops! That's amazing! I'll be a kitty cat. I didn't know that. Chances are good that most puppies will be taken care of, as one in three American households currently have a dog or puppy. Cool! Hit my pup brain with more totally cool facts, Scuzzy Bot. Dogs gestate in the womb at a much shorter rate than human babies, and mommy dogs carry their puppies for only about 60 days, or two months, before they're born. Totally woof-tastic. I know, right? And people who own dogs treat those animals like members of the family, which they are. Seventy percent of dog owners sign their pet's name on holiday cards for friends and loved ones. Amazing! Do puppies also go to school, just like a human family's can? Great question, Boobear. While puppies don't go to school for reading, writing or arithmetic, like human children, they sometimes go do go to behavior training and housebreaking classes. So, yes, they kind of do go to school. Whoa! Cool factoid. So what is the best way for a good family to find a puppy that's right for them? There's more than one way to do that, Piper. In fact, there's a wide variety of ways, depending on the family, the puppy, and the situation. Wow! Can you tell us some of these ways, Scuzzy Bot? I sure can. Unfortunately for puppies, the world currently has a real homeless-animal problem, and homeless animals outnumber homeless people five to one. That's a bad ratio. But luckily, more people are animal lovers than not, so many homeless puppies find their way off the streets and into good and loving homes. Whoa, Scuzzy Bot. They're very lucky. I'm so happy these poor little guys get a chance to meet their forever person, who will love them. Totally. How else can someone meet the puppy of their dreams, Scuzzy Bot? Excellent question, Boobear. A person can also find their perfect puppy through a variety of reputable breeders, like the ones who are endorsed by groups like the American Kennel Club or the Westminster Kennel Dog Club. Wow! There are big organizations that care that much about little puppies? That's amazing, Scuzzy Bot! Very good observation, Boobear. There are actually many organizations that focus on helping puppies and animals of all kinds. Really? Who are they? The Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International are just two who do a lot of good. Then there's People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Friends of Animals, and Petfinder. The A.S.P.C.A. is another one. It stands for "The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals." Whoa! What types of stuff do they do? They're a longtime leader in rescue, adoption and welfare for puppies and other animals who sometimes don't have people who want to take care of them. I don't know who wouldn't want to take care of a cute, cuddly little puppy. Who wouldn't want to do that? Good question, Boobear. The unfortunate truth is, some people don't have the time, skills, or interest in raising a puppy. Puppies are a lot of work, in case you don't know. And luckily for them, there are a lot more people and organizations that do care and want to help. And I've got a surprise for you guys. We're about to drop in on some wonderful groups who do great jobs training puppies to grow up big and strong and good, and live long lives with their people. - Whoo-hoo! - Yay! Here we are, Pup Scouts... puppy class 101. This is just one place where puppies learn the basics... basic training, if you will... of behavior and communication. Look at all the toys and the treats! Where are we? Welcome to a dog-training center, Piper. Wow! What do they do here? Well, some places offer grooming, training, boarding, daycare and adoption services for recent puppy parents. That sounds like they cover it all. Pretty much, Piper. Some of these places offer puppy and adult dog training classes at affordable prices. They are run by a staff of experts for interested pet owners. After just a few classes, any wild and wooly puppy can transform into a well-behaved and good-mannered member of the family. Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit. That's incredible! Exactly what kinds of things do puppies learn in puppy schooling, Scuzzy Bot? That's a great question, Piper. Puppies learn everything they need to join a human owner or family's home, but also the basics of how to behave and be good dogs all by themselves. As we know, some of the biggest issues with puppies occur when they're left alone. Hyperactivity, boredom, confusion and fear can lead to all kinds of behavioral problems, especially if the puppy has access to delicate things or breakables. Sweet barbecue bones! I had no idea. Sounds like schooling can come in handy in more ways than one. How long do puppy classes usually last? Excellent question, Piper. I see you're paying close attention. It depends on the puppy, but experts recommend keeping puppy training sessions short... no more than 15 minutes, or even shorter, if the puppy has a short attention span. If training runs too long, energetic puppies stand a good chance of getting distracted or bored, and that's when most mistakes happen. How long do people train puppies before the training takes effect and becomes their new behavior, Scuzzy Bot? It usually takes four to six months to train, but sometimes takes as long as a year, Boobear. Whoa! Beagle brain blast! That's incredible! I have a question! If puppies are born in litters of multiple numbers, that could make for a whole class full of rowdy puppies. What's the biggest litter of puppies ever born, Scuzzy Bot? The biggest litter of puppies ever born is 24, to a Neapolitan mastiff named Tia on November 29, 2004, in the United Kingdom. And Tia's full name is Abellatino Arabella. Hey, Piper, I think we just found the answer to General Hot Dog's "what the woof" question. You're right, Boobear. The largest litter of puppies ever born is 24. Congratulations on finding the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question, Pup Scouts General Hot Dog will be proud of you, no bones about it. Fantastic work, Pup Scouts. Your mission was a great success. You're well on your way to winning the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and all the bones you can eat for a year! Tail-waggin' awesome! Say, were you able to find the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question? Yes, General Hot Dog. We sure did. The largest litter of puppies ever born is 24, to Tia, a Neapolitan mastiff in the U.K. They were born on November 29, 2004, and Tia's full name is Abellatino Arabella. That's great! Good job, Pup Scouts. Your next mission is going to be your most awesome yet. We want you to learn about how dogs help man. How dogs help man? Wow! Cool! I'll be a bacon strip! Can't wait to get started. Ears flappin'! Tail wiggling. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Greetings, Pup Scouts. Hey, General Hot Dog. Hey, General Hot Dog.

It's up to you learn all about it and report back to me with what you've discovered. Sweet barbecue sauce! This is going to be an incredible adventure! What can you tell us about how dogs help man, General Hot Dog? Dogs are the first domesticated species in history, and they've been purposely bred over the centuries for various desirable traits. Physical traits, behavioral traits and sensory traits all endear dogs to humans and strengthen the bonds between them, historically making the dog valued, revered and loved. Wow! I can't wait to find out more. How dogs help man... sounds so interesting. As you know, Boobear and Piper, to win the annual Pup Scouts of the World, you must find out and learn tons of amazing facts about dogs. - Yes, General Hot Dog! - We will! Awesome! You must also know there is a question that all the brightest canine minds all over the world have not been able to answer about how dogs help man. We need you two Pup Scouts to help us answer the "what the woof" question about how dogs help man. "What the woof" question." How cool. What is the question? Well, for some time, dogs have been used to aid man in medical areas. One of the most prominent and helpful of these have been dogs that are specifically trained to help the blind to see. Today's "what the woof" question is this: "Who was history's very first Seeing Eye dog?" That's a great question, General Hot Dog. We'll sniff out the answer in the wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see. I will assign you the best Pup Scout helper in the world: Scuzzy Bot. He's a robotic encyclopedia of canine knowledge. He will assist you on your mission. Scuzzy Bot! We love Scuzzy Bot! Be sure to ask a lot of questions, Pup Scouts. You have a prestigious Smartest Pooch award to win... and all the bones you can eat for a year! Have an amazing adventure, you two. All right! Pup Scouts... Hurray! Pup Scouts! Ready to get started on your next adventure? Super ready. Is a Frisbee ready to fly? Remember, Pup Scouts, any and all questions you have, I'm here to answer them. - Where do we begin? - I'm glad you asked. Let's begin with some of the most feel-good stories we can find where dogs haven't only helped humans, they've saved lives. It's no secret that dog and man form a bond as strong... and at times greater... than people do with each other. Humans can sometimes be complicated creatures, but dogs, not so much. With dogs, you always know where you stand. The dog is a natural companion animal, and if a dog likes you, you'll be inseparable. Likewise, if a dog doesn't like you, you'll know that too. Dogs wear their hearts on their s... um... sleeves, and in times of distress, it's not uncommon for dogs to risk their lives for their human families. Incredible. My little puppy mind is officially blown. I'll be a burger patty. I didn't know that! Oh, it's true, Boobear. It's all true. In emergencies, natural disasters, or just instances of plain, old trouble, dogs have come up big for the people in their lives. Let's take a look at some downright heroic dogs and the amazing things they've done to help man in times of need or distress. Incredible. Hit me with more super facts, Scuzzy Bot. Life can be unpredictable and sometimes dangerous when things happen beyond our control. Natural disasters like fire, floods and earthquakes can't be controlled, only dealt with as best people can. And sometimes they need a little extra help dealing with problems that arise. This is where dogs have come up big over the years, alerting man to danger and even saving the lives of their loved ones. Totally incredible! Dogs have woken sleeping people up to alert them to trouble, and in some really bad cases, they've led man to safety. Without their dogs, these people might have died. Amazing! How do dogs possess the quality to lead people of of, say, a burning building? Great question, Boobear. There are a few different answers. Dogs have better eyesight than humans do, with large pupils and a better ability to process light, or the lack thereof. If it's dark, or if smoke from a fire makes it hard to see, a wide-eyed dog can come in real handy. Whoa. Cool factoid. What other super senses do dogs have? I'm glad you asked, Piper. Along with their exceptional eyesight, dogs can also hear much better than humans. With super sensitive ears, dogs can register sounds way before man's audio spectrum, and they have mobile ears that are able to pinpoint the exact source of any sound by using an array of muscles that lift, lower, tilt and pivot their ears. And dogs are also able to pick up sounds at four times the distance that a human can. Sounds like dogs practically have super powers. What other special senses do dogs possess, Scuzzy Bot? A supercharged sense of smell also helps dogs to do all kinds of cool things, Boobear. Smell receptors dominate a dog's brain, much like visual receptors dominate man's brain. Dogs have approximately 40 times more smell sensitivity than humans do, allowing them to detect a scent's direction and track its source. But how does strength of smell allow a dog to track down the source of that smell? Excellent question, Boobear. A dog's wet nose allows it to detect the air breeze that contains a particular scent. Does that explain why so many lost dogs are able to find their ways home, Scuzzy Bot? Very good observation, Boobear. That's exactly why. If a dog gets out of its yard and wanders its neighborhood, it can still use the scent of home to find its way back, provided the dog hasn't roamed so far that it loses that scent. That's never fun, and usually requires a good Samaritan to find and return the dog to its owner. What about tracking people, Scuzzy Bot? Do dogs ever do that? They sure do. Dogs track all kinds of people, and things too. In the law-enforcement world, dogs are often used to track down escaped prisoners and return them to jail to finish their sentences. Whoa! Do dogs ever track good people too? They do indeed, Piper. They've tracked missing children, helped guide lost hikers out of the woods, and even gotten medical help for injured people. Dogs track everything, all the time, for all kinds of reasons. It's a skill they don't really turn off. Like a basic instinct. - Or a super power. - Absolutely. - Whoo-hoo! - Yay! Here we are, Pup Scouts. Take a look around. This is where dogs help man the most. Looks like any other city on any other day to me. That's because it is, Piper. Most dogs share their lives with man, so when trouble arises or help is needed, who's usually the first on the scene? Dogs! Makes sense, Scuzzy Bot. But-But how many emergencies do average people face in a day? Uh, it depends on what we consider emergencies, Boobear. Some people just need a little help finding their lost car keys. Enter, one sensitive-snouted canine. That's crazy. No wonder they call dogs "man's best friend." Indeed, Piper. Guard dogs have also come in handy for humans, protecting homes and businesses from break-ins and theft. Then, on the other hand, someone might need help escaping a dangerous flood. A heroic dog can certainly come in handy there too, and has. Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit. That's incredible! Fires, floods, and lost car keys. That covers a lot of the ways someone can be helped. Just how did dogs and humans develop such a strong bond anyway? That's a great question, Piper. The domestic relationship between dog and man has been traced back about 13,000 years. Based on archeological findings, including dog bones buried near, and sometimes with, human remains, it's been concluded that the relationship between dogs and man has been developing almost from the very beginning. Sweet barbecue bones! I had no idea. Do you think a dog's instinct to be a part of a pack figures into their close relationship with humans? Do they actually see man as a member of their pack? Excellent question, Piper. I see you're paying close attention. It's true that dogs instinctively want to bond with a pack. The inborn desire to bond could be a reason why they express such unconditional loyalty and affection for humans. Wow! Do dogs think man is like them? Just another weird-looking dog? Interesting question, Boobear. Dogs know the difference between themselves and man, but research suggests that the closer the relationship, like a single owner with a dog who gets all their attention, for instance, the more likely it is that the dog views itself as equal to man. Whoa! Beagle brain blast! - That's incredible! - I have a question. We heard that dogs are often used in medical rehabilitation, like helping the blind to see. Do you know, who was the very first Seeing Eye dog, Scuzzy Bot? As a matter of fact, I do, Boobear. The world's first Seeing Eye guide dog was a female German shepherd named Kiss, but renamed Buddy after training to assist her new owner, a man named Morris Frank. Buddy helped Mr. Frank to get around in the world again, with activities like crossing busy streets, using staircases, and opening doors... things that had been previously un-doable by a blind man. Hey, Piper, I think we just found the answer to General Hot Dog's "what the woof" question. You're right, Boobear. The world's first Seeing Eye guide dog was Buddy, belonging to Mr. Morris Frank. Congratulations on finding the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question, Pup Scouts. General Hot Dog will be proud of you. No bones about it. Fantastic work, Pup Scouts. Your mission was a great success. You're well on your way to winning the prestigious Smartest Pooch award... and all the bones you can eat for a year! Tail-waggin' awesome! Say, were you able to find out the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question? Yes, General Hot Dog. We sure did. The world's first Seeing Eye guide dog was named Buddy. And Buddy helped a blind man named Morris Frank. That's great! Good job, Pup Scouts! What's our next mission, General Hot Dog? Your next mission is going to be the most awesome yet. We want you to learn about different dog breeds. Dog breeds? Wow! Cool! I'll be a bacon strip. Can't wait to get started. Ears flappin'. Tail wiggling. Pup Scouts are ready for the chase, General Hot Dog. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Greetings, Pup Scouts. Hey, General Hot Dog.

It's up to you to learn all about it, and report back to me with what you've discovered. Sweet barbecue sauce! This is going to be an incredible adventure! What can you tell us about dog breeds, General Hot Dog? Now, that's a broad question, Piper. There are many different dog breeds in the world, all distinguishable by types and their unique traits and characteristics. There are way too many to list off the top of my head, actually. Wow! I can't wait to find out more. Lots and lots of different dog breeds. Sounds so interesting. As you know, Boobear and Piper, to win the annual Pup Scouts of the World, you must find out and learn tons of amazing facts about dogs. - Yes, General Hot Dog. - We will. Awesome!

By "mixed-breed," I mean a dog born from mating two different purebred dogs to make a new breed containing characteristics of both the mother and the father dog! That's a great question, General Hot Dog. We'll sniff out the answer in the wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see. I will assign you the best Pup Scout helper in the world: Scuzzy Bot. He's a robotic encyclopedia of canine knowledge. He will assist you on your mission. Scuzzy Bot! We love Scuzzy Bot! Be sure to ask a lot of questions, Pup Scouts. You have a prestigious Smartest Pooch award to win, and all the bones you can eat for a year! Have an amazing adventure, you two. All right! Pup Scouts... Hurray! Pup Scouts, ready to get started on your next adventure? - Super ready! - Ha, ha! Is a Frisbee ready to fly? Remember, Pup Scouts, any and all questions you have, - I'm here to answer them. - Where do we begin? Where else? Let's begin at the most fun place to see different dog breeds on parade and one of the big three major competitive dog shows in the United States, the National Dog Show! I'll be a hot dog without mustard. I didn't know that. Starting way back in 1879, it was originally known as the Kennel Club of Philadelphia Dog Show. the Kennel Club of Philadelphia was one of the founding clubs of the American Kennel Club, who we previously learned about, if you recall. In 2002, NBC began airing the annual the Kennel Club of Philadelphia Dog Show every Thanksgiving Day, and they renamed it the National Dog Show. Sweet pork chops! That's amazing! I'll be a kitty cat. I didn't know that. Oh, well, there you go, Boobear. The show has been put on every year since its inception in 1879, with the exception of a break during America's Great Depression from 1928 through 1932. And the show traditionally features a dazzling array of dog breeds... more dog breeds than I can even remember. You name the breed, and it's probably appeared here throughout the years. Incredible! Hit my puppy brain with more incredible facts, Scuzzy Bot. The National Dog Show has hosted some of the most fun and funniest dog breeds ever displayed to the public. Every breed's traits, strengths, endearing qualities and quirks are on full display at this show. And with an impressive network TV audience of over 20 million viewers, the dog breeds that compete at the National Dog Show get a lot of attention. - Totally woof-tastic. - It sure is, Piper. And just some of the dogs that have won the competition in recent years reads like a who's who of barking superstars. Breeds like the American foxhound, the bloodhound, Skye terrier, the greyhound, the wire fox terrier, the Irish setter, Scottish setter, the pointer, Australian shepherd and toy poodles have all claimed the dog show's highest prize: Best in Show. Amazing! Have any mixed dog breeds ever won Best in Show at the National Dog Show? Great question, Boobear. But no. Mixed-breed or crossbreed dogs are specifically banned from competing in the National Dog Show, which showcases only the best 100% purebred dogs it can find. You don't say? That sounds great for purebred dogs, but not so much for crossbreeds, who surely are just as beautiful, impressive, talented and lovable, right, Scuzzy Bot? Right, Piper. And funny you mention it, because dog lovers the world over recognized exactly that, which is why there are now mixed-breed dog show competitions, showcasing the best mutts from around the world. Whoa! Tell us about some of these dog shows. And who are the dogs who've won them, Scuzzy Bot? Absolutely, Boobear. The mixed-breed dog clubs of America have made great strides in including some amazing crossbred dogs in high-level competitions. Some prominent groups, events, and championship games that now focus on mixed-breed dogs are the United Kennel Club, Classic Canine Games, the Mixed-Breed Clubs of America, and the North American Flyball Association. Whoa, Scuzzy Bot, that factoid is cooler than a popsicle after a run. So, do the major dog clubs now recognize these previously ignored mixed breeds, Scuzzy Bot? Great question, Boobear. And the answer is, yes. Since 2010, the American Kennel Club has included clearly mixed breeds in its competitions, delighting dog lovers the world over. That's awesome! After all, a dog's skill, beauty and intelligence shouldn't be confined only to pure breeding, right Scuzzy Bot? Very good point, Boobear. That's right. In fact, some very notable and popular dog breeds have appeared as a result of crossbreeding, and many of these dogs are actually healthier than the strictly purebred ones. Yowza! Can you tell us about some of them? I can do better than that, Piper. Why don't we take a look? - Whoa! Can we? - Sure, we can. Here we go! Uh, it kinda feels like we're heading into Frankenstein's laboratory. Nothing to worry about, Boobear. Designer dogs, as some people call them, are every bit as loyal and lovable as pure breeds. Come on. Let's check 'em out and see. - Whoo-hoo! - Yay! Here we are, Pup Scouts: designer dog paradise. A crossbreeding wonderland. Holy burger balls. What's that one over there? Ah, that's the Frankenstein terrier, Piper. The what? I'm only kidding, Boobear. These dogs are some of the cutest, most unique mutts you'll find anywhere. - Let's meet them, shall we? - As long as they don't bite. They don't bite, right? No, they don't bite, Piper. Take this little guy, for instance. This one's lovingly referred to as a dorgi. That's a Dalmatian and a corgi, for your information. And we have here a pitsky... pit bull and husky. And while we're here, we mustn't ignore the chusky... chow chow and husky. And look over there at that one. That's a Labsky... Labrador retriever and husky. Wow! I'll be a chew toy. That's amazing! It looks like huskies are popular in crossbreeding. Are any other dog breeds mixed often? That's a great question, Piper! Truth is, the combinations are endless. There we have the absolutely adorable Chug... Chihuahua and pug... and the cuddle-icious Dalmuchsund... Dalmatian and dachshund, Then there's the Yorkiepoo, the corman shepherd, and on and on. Amazing bouncing balls! I had no idea! Is it safe to cross breed any dog, Scuzzy Bot, or are there health risks involved? Excellent question, Piper. I see you're paying close attention. Studies have actually found a few more genetic defects in purebreds than in mixed breeds. But overall, there seems to be no recurring trends in the genetic health or illness of a dog based on crossbreeding alone. So by all accounts, it is not dangerous to mix dog breeds. Leftover-licious, that's great! By contrast, some pure breeds experience negative health trends that are quite unpleasant and sometimes even life-threatening. Great Danes' hearts sometimes struggle to support their giant bodies. King Charles spaniels are sometimes born with heads too small for their brains, and a reported 60% of golden retrievers contract cancer. So while purebreds remain as popular as ever at dog shows, there can be risks in maintaining those perfect breed standards. Whoa, I'm just blown away. I didn't realize that. I have a question. What was the first-ever mixed-breed dog, Scuzzy Bot? Good question. And I have a two-part answer for you, Boobear. The very first mutt, or mixed-breed dog, is actually impossible to know. From the beginning, dogs have crossbred and been intentionally crossbred to create stronger breeds more suited to particular tasks with specific desired traits. Even purebred dogs are the result of early crossbreeding, and only designated pure by modern sanctioning bodies, like the American Kennel Club, who applied what they called a breed standard to the animal. By those modern standards, I can tell you who the first mixed-breed dog show champion was. Her name was Katie Lee, a former shelter dog who, in April 2010, became the first-ever mutt to win an AKC title. Hey, Piper, I think we just found the answer to General Hot Dog's "what the woof" question. You're right, Boobear. There's no way to know the first mixed-breed dog, but Katie Lee was the first one to win a championship under modern rules. Congratulations on finding the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question, Pup Scouts. General Hot Dog will be proud of you, no bones about it. Fantastic work, Pup Scouts. Your mission was a great success. You're well on your way to winning the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and... all the bones you can eat for a year! Ball-bouncin' awesome! Were you able to find the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question? Yes, General Hot Dog. We sure did. There's no way to know who was the first mixed-breed dog. But a former shelter dog named Katie Lee was the very first American Kennel Club-certified mixed-breed champion. That's great! Good job, Pup Scouts. What's our next mission, General Hot Dog? Your next mission is going to be your most awesome yet. We want you to learn about Chinese chow chows and pugs! Chinese chow chows and pugs? - Super awesome! -Cool. Can't wait to get started. Tail wiggling. Ears flappin'. Pup Scouts are ready for the chase, General Hot Dog. - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo! - Greetings, Pup Scouts. - Hey, General Hot Dog. - Hey, General Hot Dog. - Piper, Boobear, it's time for the annual Pup Scouts of the World contest, where teams compete for the chance to win the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and all the bones you can eat for a year. Your job is to chase, fetch and report all there is to know about dogs, puppies, and everything in between. You will travel all over the world, across time, space and beyond. You must keep your nose to the wind, your ears perked, and your paws to the wheel at all times. We depend on you to do the best job possible. Are you ready for your first assignment? Tail wiggling. Ears flappin'. Pup Scouts are ready for the chase, General Hot Dog. This is sure to be a challenging mission, little ones. Succulent wishbones! I love challenging missions. Slappin' tails, me too! I'm sending you two on a mission to learn about chow chows and pugs! - Chow chows and pugs? How cool! - Can't wait! It's up to you to learn all about it and report back to me with what you've discovered. Sweet barbecue sauce! This is going to be an incredible adventure! What can you tell us about chow chows and pugs, General Hot Dog? The chow chow is a dog breed from northern China. In China, it's referred to as songshi quan, which means "puffy lion dog." The pug is also from China, and it was brought to Europe way back in the 16th century, where it achieved great popularity through the royal families, particularly the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria. Wow! I can't wait to find out more. Chow chows and pugs? Sounds so interesting. As you know, Boobear and Piper, to win the annual Pup Scouts of the World, you must find out and learn tons of amazing facts about dogs. - Yes, General Hot Dog. - We will. Awesome! You must also know that there is a question that all the brightest canine minds all over the world have not been able to answer about chow chows and pugs! We need you two Pup Scouts to help us answer the "what the woof" question about dog breeds! "What the woof" question? How cool. What is the question? The "what the woof" question is this: "Can you name one physical trait that is found in both chow chows and pugs?" That's a great question, General Hot Dog. We'll sniff out the answer in the wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see. I will assign you the best Pup Scout helper in the world: Scuzzy Bot. He's a robotic encyclopedia of canine knowledge. He will assist you on your mission. Scuzzy Bot! We love Scuzzy Bot! Be sure to ask a lot of questions, Pup Scouts. You have a prestigious Smartest Pooch award to win, and all the bones you can eat for a year! Have an amazing adventure, you two. All right! Pup Scouts... Hurray! Pup Scouts! Ready to get started on your next adventure? Super ready. Is a Frisbee ready to fly? Remember, Pup Scouts, any and all questions you have, I'm here to answer them. - Where do we begin? - We're going on a journey, Pup Scouts. Today, we'll begin where both of these great dog breeds began: China. Here we are, Pup Scouts... the homeland of both chow chows and pugs... the country of China. With a huge population of over one billion people, it's big and busy. Chow chows and pugs go back a long way, as both of them are considered ancient dog breeds. Sweet pork chops! That's amazing! I'll be a hot dog without mustard. I didn't know that. Oh, there's a lot to know about chow chows and pugs, Boobear. - So let's get to learning. - Incredible! Hit my puppy brain with more info, Scuzzy Bot. Let's find out more. Both of these dogs have such interesting and varied histories, yet in some ways, they're not as different as they look. Both chow chows and pugs were big favorites of the early monarchies and royal families. Amazing! Why did kings and queens like them so much, Scuzzy Bot? Great question, Boobear. As we know, every dog is a loyal friend to someone in their life. But chow chows are known for their loyalty above most else... so much so, that they were used as palace guards in ancient China, Mongolia and Tibet. Wow. Cool bit of chow info. Can you tell us what cool stuff pugs have done? I sure can. Whereas chow chows have a reputation for being fierce to strangers, pugs have a reputation for being gentle, sociable, and intuitive to their owners' moods. Early Chinese emperors valued their pugs so greatly that the dogs had their own palace guards. Jumpin' jerky treats! So, chow chows worked as guards, and pugs had guards. Did a chow chow ever guard a pug, Scuzzy Bot? I'm not sure, Boobear, but it's certainly possible. Although the pug was also employed as a guard dog throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, after one famous pug named Pompeii saved the life of Europe's Prince of Orange in 1572 by warning him of approaching assassins. Chow chows and pugs sure sound loyal, and smart too! Do they do well in training? Excellent question, Boobear. Chow chows are actually known for being resistant to training and kind of stubborn unless they're taught well from a very young age. As they get older, they're known to become attached and overly protective of one family member, unless they receive dedicated and regular socialization. Interesting. And what about pugs, Scuzzy Bot? They seem too cute and cuddly to be antisocial. Very good observation, Boobear. Pugs actually have a reputation for being lazy and can spend a lot of time napping if they don't have the proper stimulation. A big family with lots of action and attention suits them well. Unlike chow chows, they're great with children and the perfect size to play without anyone getting accidentally hurt. That's awesome. Pugs sound pretty low-maintenance. In some ways they are, Piper, but in some other ways, they require a lot of maintenance. You see, pugs have some unique physical traits that make them prone to health problems that other dogs don't have to worry about. Whoa. Like what, Scuzzy Bot? Well, on account of their short, mashed snouts, pugs are subject to breathing problems, allergies, and something called "reverse sneezing." Reverse sneezing? You mean, they sneeze into their own mouths? No, Boobear. Reverse sneezing is characterized by loud gasping and snorting that makes it look like a dog's choking. These episodes usually aren't harmful, but other genetic pug issues could lead to blocked airways that make the dog pass out or overheat. With a little regular care and maintenance, these conditions can be overcome, allowing the pug to lead a normal lifespan of about 11 years, though the oldest known pug lived to be 20. Look at those chow chows. Let's check 'em out. Here we are, Pup Scouts... a genuine Chinese chow chow kennel, complete with oodles of the cute little buggers, and big buggers! They do it all here, from breeding to training to competitive showing to finding these dogs their forever homes. Wow. I can see a lot of the traits you mentioned, Scuzzy Bot. Chow chows really are loyal, playful and ferocious, all at once. That they are, and then some, Piper, all rolled up in a cute, super-fuzzy ball of impressive canine. Hopping hot hamburger patties, look at that one! What's that chow doing over there? It looks like he's ready to go play, Boobear. Chow chows sure can be funny when they want to be. Oh, don't let their stoic guard-dog traits fool you, Piper. Chows can be downright goofy. Take a look at that crazy one. Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit. That's incredible! Are there pug kennels too, where pugs can be bred, raised, trained and adopted? That's a great question, Piper! Yes, there sure are pug kennels. As a matter of fact, turn around. There happens to be one right over there. Sweet bones of delight! You're right! Mighty marrow bone chews! Pugs are so darn cute and cuddly. I almost can't stand it! Say, why are some pugs beige while others are black? Are those the only two colors a pug comes in? Excellent question, Piper! I see you're paying close attention. Those two colors, known as black and fawn, are generally the most common pug coat colors, and also the only two colors recognized by the the American Kennel Club, although pug coats can and do span a spectrum of colors, including shades of silver and gold. Cool! So do chow chows also come in more colors than the black and golden brown we often see? Absolutely, Boobear. Chows generally appear in five different coat colors: black, cinnamon, red, blue and cream. They're usually just as fluffy, though, no matter what color they are. Whoa! Total brain blast. That's incredible! I have a question. Besides hailing from China and being loyal to their families, do chow chows and pugs have any specific traits in common, Scuzzy Bot? Hmm. You bet they do, Boobear. Both chow chows and pugs share the common trait of a blue, black or spotted tongue. Thirty percent of purebred dogs share this distinctive trait, and the chow chow and pug are within that percentage. Hey, Piper, I think we just found the answer to General Hot Dog's "what the woof" question. You're right, Boobear. Chow chows and pugs both both share the tendency for blue, black or spotted tongues. Congratulations on finding the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question, Pup Scouts. General Hot Dog will be proud of you. No bones about it. Fantastic work, Pup Scouts. Your mission was a great success. You're well on your way to winning the prestigious Smartest Pooch award and... all the bones you can eat for a year! Tail-waggin' awesome! Were you able to find the answer to this mission's "what the woof" question? Yes, General Hot Dog, we did. Chow chows and pugs both share the tendency for blue, black or spotted tongues. Thirty percent of pure breeds have this characteristic, including the chow chows and the pugs. That's great! Good job, Pup Scouts! What's our next mission, General Hot Dog? Your next mission is going to be your most awesome yet. We want you to learn about French bulldogs and poodles! French bulldogs and poodles? Wow, cool! I'll be a squeaky toy. Can't wait to get started. - Tail wiggling. - Ears flappin'. Pup Scouts are ready for the chase, General Hot Dog. Subtitles by explosiveskull
