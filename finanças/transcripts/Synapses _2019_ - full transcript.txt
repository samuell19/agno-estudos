Grandpa says... In his memories... the breezes are fragrant... there are reflections in the water... and the trees sway in the wind He says Life is just like an album of images if the memories weren't there... maybe his life could change a bit for the better Have it while it's hot Hey - Come on! - I'll be right there Ah Chuan! Dinner time! - Fine - Come on! You took Grandpa to the market So you should be the one to look after him Don't let him wander off by himself like that What if you couldn't find him? Would you get me a new Grandpa? I didn't mean to So what happened? I told him to wait in the market And he just wandered off I had to go find Mr Turkey I had to get an egg from him - What egg? - A turkey egg Why did you need that? For my homework! Those eggs you gave me from the fridge... They won't hatch Those eggs are dead The chicks died ages ago Whatever egg you get, it won't hatch Where do chickens come from then? They're hatched from eggs, aren't they? Smart-ass! Caught in the act! Feng, you got here at last! You heartless people Sit here! How can you start gambling without me? Boss... I'll put ten bucks on you... Since you're on a winning streak Don't worry, it'll look great Now the upper lip... Keep your face still Are you a monkey? Come on... Keep your face still Your grandma took many days off for you recently, everything alright? It's our busiest time She says I need to practice more It's okay Ah-Chuan, I know you are a good boy But you should still finish your homework You see, all your classmate hatched their eggs Last time Gran gave me an egg from the fridge - An egg from the fridge? - It's impossible to be hatched Toss it! Right up! You didn't notice the ceiling? My Grandma... Feet! Is a very kind person Toes! She works very hard Since I was three Grandma... has been taking me... and my uncle on stage... to act in Taiwanese operas She always says that... spending thirty minutes on stage... is like racing through... thirty years of real life I don't get what she and Grandpa say I really don't understand But... Gran says... In a few days, my mother... will come out of prison It makes me think... Maybe... my dad will soon show up too Anyone here? I'm back Dad! I'm home Who are you looking for? Dad! It's me Xiao Meng Ma, Sis is back Coming... Sis Why put the fire there? You got it wrong! Watch out, dear Where have the neighbors gone? It's the urban renewal. I want to move out too Don't come in yet! Yuchang, here Stay where you are! What's wrong? You set the fire on the wrong threshold! How should I know which door? We have all these doors... What are you talking about? The front door! - Ma, what's wrong? - Nothing... Out of the way! Careful! Step over the fire Burn away the bad luck! Step over the fire, burn away the bad luck Bring us health and happiness! Yeah, we need it! - What? - Go on... It's Xiao Meng! Your daughter! - She's back! - Sis... Everything okay here? Sure, it's fine Ah Chuan Ah Chuan It's your ma Ah Chuan You wanna sit by her? We can swap seats - How about it? - Ah Chuan! Stop drawing! Eat your dinner! Come on Eat up! - Okay - What's the matter? Okay He's grown up a lot That's right. In six years... It's what you'd expect Yes You've put on weight too Haven't you? Weren't you quite thin before? You stuffed yourself in jail? Hardly You should eat more Ah Chuan, pick up Grandpa's chopsticks He dropped them Grandpa peed! Dear... Let's go to the bedroom and get changed Come, get up Let's get changed Where's the roof? Blown away in the typhoon Sleep here for tonight Tomorrow... I'll get the room ready When I done cleaning your dad's room You can sleep there Dad... doesn't sleep in his own room? Whatever you like Get some rest Ah Chuan Your ma's upstairs - You want to talk to her? - No No Ah Chuan... Why not go upstairs? C'mon, I'll go with you Don't want to Why not? Take this It's from your dad Buy some new clothes And get rid of the ones you're wearing The things you had in prison... Bad luck Make sure you throw them away Don't go on wearing what you wore in prison It's bad luck How's dad doing? I'm taking him to the hospital Mr Turkey! Mr Turkey! Mr Turkey! Ah Chuan, all right there? Mr Turkey... In our house... there's now one more person My ma's back now - She's out of jail - Oh It's a holiday homework project We're supposed to hatch an egg What kind of egg? - A chicken egg? - One that will hatch, so... - Any kind of egg will do? - Yup Can you give me one? You want... one of my turkey eggs? I don't think any of this lot will do - Why not? - How about one from the next lot? These are too old You couldn't make one of them hatch You'd be wasting your efforts No point Sorry... Sorry to disappoint you The file says you've spent time in Hong Kong and Canada What were you doing there? I spent awhile in Canada And then... I was in Hong Kong and Mainland China with my father All told, two or three years Mostly I was studying dance Since your release... have you met your husband? Or... Forgive me... The file isn't clear on this point Is he your boyfriend? He's not my husband We're not formally married But we have a child Fine What about friends? Been in touch with any friends? Only with... some of the people I met in prison I have a small suggestion It may be helpful to you Based on my experience... working on previous cases... It's a good idea to refresh your social circle Those bad friends... The ones who got you intro trouble in the first place... Better to avoid them, don't contact them Don't forget you're under probation for six more years if there's the least problem... not to mention anything more serious... Something like drink-driving, you'll go straight back into custody Anyhow... Keep up your self-respect Your boy is still young, he'll need plenty of looking-after Just... try to be good Make sure your six years in prison weren't wasted That's my sincere advice Take it slow Ma'am, I'll try to explain it to you We've given your husband... a thorough examination The results suggest the onset of Alzheimer's We're prescribing a course of Aricept for him That will slow down the progress of the disease But it won't cure the disease So his capacity to look after himself... may decline slightly as time goes on Beyond that, there might be changes in his personality His temperament could become unstable There's also the possibility... that he will experience difficulty... in recognizing those around him Even with the medicine... his condition won't improve? It will definitely help It's our standard prescription for this disease But the way it works... is to slow down the progress of the disease It's not a cure for the disease itself That means that eventually... he'll forget things from the past too? Yes, that's possible It's not unusual... that patients become more obviously forgetful I see Your girl is back? That's right Your little Ah Chuan... must be happy? To have his mother back? Why would he? When she was sent to prison he was just an infant Ah Chuan was only two or three He doesn't remember anything She may be his mother, but I'm the one who brought him up As I see it, now she's back... Well, she's the mother That's all there is to it You want me to meet Ah Chuan? - Yes - Of course I want to It's so long since I last saw you I almost forget how you look So you haven't had sex for six years? You must be gagging for it, no? Come, give me a kiss Alright Sit down Go Okay, you'd better go Go Leave! Are you sick? - That's right, I'm sick - Just leave Falling for you made me sick You made me sick I myself think I'm pretty sick Why... Do you love me? You think that's funny? I did love you Now I don't remember You think it's funny? Darling... It's really that funny? Fucking hell! It doesn't matter Just leave I also think I'm a fucking failure Why don't you love me, even a little bit? Why did I have Ah Chuan? - Why did you get me pregnant? - Just leave! Why did you get me pregnant? I want to know! Are you off your head? Yes I fucking am! I don't remember Don't have regrets Leave the past behind What does matter, then? What matters? What do you actually care about? - I've lost one pen - Which one? It's light blue, seen it? Can you even tell what color it is? And you go accusing people of taking it! Have you got it or not? Of course not! Why would I take your pen? It's here If you keep scattering pens everywhere... you'll fill the room with them! It's because you're almost never here Get on with your homework Why don't you sleep with your ma? I don't even know her, why should I? What do you mean you don't know her? - She's your ma! - I told you, I don't know her! She's still your ma Then you should sleep with Gran! I'm a man! A grown man! Your birthday is coming up soon You know what? An old friend is coming to see you Who? Someone you know well You'll know when they arrive Everyone's moved out Uncle Guan left My old commander left We're the only ones still here Right... And they're telling us to go too But you like it here, never mind Your beloved wife will stay here with you Back when your mother was still with us... she was always telling you... to take me out To take me away... on trips Oh, and... to take me to see shows Dance performances, all kinds of things You've always been great Your mother used to say... Wow, what a fine man you are As leader of the Armed Forces Entertainments Division... you did so much to boost morale You really did! Your hands are so beautiful This one's done, come on... Give me the other one I remember that time when Ah Chuan first goes to school He was being teased You consoled him Told him that being colorblind doesn't matter I think you were right There are times when seeing too clearly... is not such a good thing You're a calm and steady person But you have an adventurous streak too, you know You love the roar of the crowd Horsewhip... Arms out! Hold out the whip and take a step Same side as your arm Horsewhip... That's it Move your hands too There are tadpoles How do you say that in Taiwanese? Don't know - "Tadpoles" - "Tadpoles" Tad poles - Brother Dao - Brother Dao You little fucker, I told you to stop pulling these stunts What do you think you're doing? What do you mean? The way I see it, the land's here I put up my poster and call it mine You think it's yours? You bet, can't you see? Want land? Call Ah Wen. Satisfaction guaranteed! Putting up a piece of paper makes it yours? Sure, it's dead simple Can't someone else do the exact same thing? If anyone tries, I'll tear it down You know whose land this is? Whose? It's Dragontail's... from the Coast Gang Dragontail's? That's cool I like a nice challenge! Stop fooling around You can't even handle your women Let alone your work! You know your ma still has a legal customs brokerage? You do know that? What line of business are you in now? Hooking people up and live streaming - Plus this turf business - All legal? Borderline legal Yeah, all talk and no beef That's why he pisses people off And now this turf nonsense I don't want to go on relying on you lot You don't want to rely on us? Who else can you rely on? - Myself! - By causing your own trouble? No way! You should stop fretting So you make a mess and we have to clean up after you? No need to clean anything up, I'll take care of any cleaning-up myself My women can help with that Same old, same old Sure, and now my ex and my new girlfriend are both here Get real! You are full already? Your face is bright red I gave you the money to buy new clothes But I see you spent it all... getting drunk, right? It's strange! Aren't you just out of jail? But you have all these friends you have to see And you can't help getting drunk with them! Why did you start dinner without me? You weren't here Who knew when you'd be back? Enough of that Just get her some rice She could have dad's bowl Just do it Can't you set a good example in front of the kid? Grandma And what about Grandpa? Grandpa Excellent You heard she called you 'Grandpa'? I'm jealous Uncle Zhang, nice to see you Meishen, are you married yet? Not yet, the dog keeps me happy for now I don't want to marry early - What is it with young people today? - What can I say? Having a pet is better than raising their own kids? Just ask Wenlin, she feels the same way - That's right! - That's what girls are like these days But look at her kids, they're so adorable! Don't you want more of them? See... You must say: Grandma, I have a gift for you - Can you do that? - A gift for you That's so nice! Thank you! Say something, dear It's so long since we last saw Brother Zhang You still recognize him? They used to live next door And now they've come back to see us How is Brother Zhang's health? Getting a bit worse Right, so he's like this now Still, living in a place like this these days... it seems quite inconvenient And I've heard that... the power supply isn't very stable Anyhow, we moved out some years ago And things are much better where we are now Yes, I'm sure it's better where you are now But he doesn't want to move Maybe you should reconsider it Yes, you might have second thoughts Uncle Zhang... it's not all that comfortable here Moving out of here would make things a bit better What the hell? This is my home! I'm not moving! Of course... Protect the home, defend the country If we don't protect out home, how can we defend our country? Don't worry... - This turkey egg is for you - It's a turkey egg? Yes You can study it for your summer homework And write your report - Take care to hatch it properly! - But... Didn't you say... it will take much longer? Yes, quite a bit longer But my turkey didn't lay this egg It's not from your turkey? It's from my turkeys friend You have friends, I have friends And the turkey has friends too So please take it for what it is Don't be upset, it's all right Now I can get on with the project Yeah But... - But what? - Weren't you supposed to use... a chicken egg? And this is a turkey egg, will it be okay? It's fine. After all, they're both eggs Good point! - And at least it's not a duck egg - That's right! Eggs from turkeys and chickens are much the same, aren't they? Pretty much That's how you keep it alive? It won't hatch for some time I always thought... a turkey egg would be bigger But actually it's not Just a bit bigger than a chicken egg What about when you're asleep? You bring it to bed? No, it'll stay here As it is? What if it doesn't hatch? You'll fail the project I'm not like you Sure, whatever I heard your ma say... you'll be meeting your dad soon Better not let Gran know Yeah, I know Like it? IPad Everyone has them now Don't want it Why not? Come on! It's your dad's gift It's okay, he doesn't have to like it Come on! Ah Chuan... Don't want it Just let him be Ah Chuan... Pick what you want to eat All the food here is fresh The ones in yellow are out of season They don't have them now - They don't have it? - That's right But it doesn't seem like yellow to me More like green This section is red And the ones at the bottom? - Ah Chuan, what color is this? - You tell me This is yellow You can't tell? Red, green and yellow... - You can't see the difference? - I always get them mixed up You can't tell the difference between colors? Fucking hell! You didn't know the kid is colorblind? How was I supposed to know in jail? He was only three when I went in What the fuck do you know? She only just got out, how was she supposed to know? It's okay, Ah Chuan I'm having lunch with my son at the chicken restaurant It's Luo again? That damn snitch Okay Fix a time for it, I'll wait for him Ah Chuan... What's that you're looking at? Who gave you that? Didn't I tell you... not to take things from people you don't know? You did, but it wasn't me who took it I don't want it Why not? It's from your father I shouldn't take things from strangers That's what Gran says It's not from a stranger It's from your father I don't know him, he's pretty much a stranger Why did you take Ah Chuan to meet Ah Wen? While you were in jail... he never came to see Ah Chuan Never gave the boy a thought Why do you even see him? Ah Wen... He hid drugs in your bag Put them in Ah Chuan's milk-powder can So you got sent down for twelve years And served six of them Why do you still see those scummy people? You just put yourself at risk again What's the point of spending time... with those low-life types? Ma... What's wrong with me? Why am I so messed-up? Tell me! I was inside for six whole years How many times did you come to visit me? Ah Chuan is your grandson But I'm not your daughter? Really? Have you ever cared about me? Well, have you? Look at father To be frank, it all seems laughable to me You're always telling him lies And look what he's turned into! What was the point? Did it make you happy? Are you happy? You dropped your knickers and got pregnant So you're happy! Am I happy? Now you talk to me like this... Does that make you happy? How can you talk to me like this... Daughter... Your homework isn't done yet, go and finish it Go on Teacher... My girl has always been stubborn, since she was small I'll make sure she does her homework Don't be angry Daughter... Let's take a photo with your teacher Come on Teacher, shall we take a photo together? Sit there... that's good, right there Come on, daughter... Come here Have a photo with your teacher A bit closer Looks good This way A little closer I'll count to three Ready? One, two, three Dragontail, this is how it is... Ah Wen can tell you himself, see what you think I've done my bit by calling this meeting How you resolve the conflict is up to you If Ah Wen behaves like this... and Dragontail doesn't accept it, it is our problem Brother Dao... what is there to discuss? What is there to say? Right What is there to discuss? For example... what do you think about the land? I've already flagged it as my turf I'm very sorry... today we're... He marched in and claimed my land! - Dragontail, I know... - I can't just ignore what he did! Let's try to stay calm I know you've come here today... in the hope that we can all be friends From here on in, all of us... including Brother Dao, should be friends I ain't here to be friends with you Today, Brother Dao... I came here just because I respect him What does this jerk have to say to me? He's just out for himself Why would he deserve a share? His claim has no merit Brother Dao, I'm going to take one step back Since I've come to this meeting... don't ever say I'm bullying this piece of shit I could send him two crates of tomatoes as a gift, okay? You know how to eat tomatoes? Ah Wen, listen when someone talks to you! We're here to solve a problem... and you're on about tomatoes? You have nothing better to contribute? Okay... The reason we're here is to talk this through Your uncle is working to find a solution... and you're just fooling around? Dragontail, it seems there's no way to resolve this? Brother Dao, you can see his attitude So there's no more to say Brother Dao I wouldn't be here if you hadn't asked me Apparently I've wasted my time My dear, come downstairs Your friend will be here soon I brought you a gift You once said that your favorite dish... is meat hotpot with pickled cabbage Right, meat and pickled cabbage My ma says she knows you like this hotpot She's treasured it for years It's pure copper Whenever you use it... it'll remind you of me It's a fine thing, looks good Ah Chuan... What do you think? One more dish is coming I'm back! - Xiao Meng is back - Why is she so noisy? So much fuss about getting home! What's wrong with her? Ah Chuan...

We don't need the hotpot right now - So I'll... - I'll move it out of the way - That's better - I suppose so If it's not in the way All of you, eat up Disgusting... The way she treats dad has changed so much They weren't that close before Still, you are a family I've always thought of your ma as a kind person We're all kind people That's right Ah Chuan is the best Always looking out for his grandpa You used to argue with Gran all the time I had to be your go-between Back then you looked out for me Now I look out for you Ah Chuan is great Have a chicken thigh I couldn't find any photo of you back in our army days Never mind, it's all in the past Brother Xiong... I came back this time to take care of my ma She's not well She needs me This was Uncle Guan's place They've all moved out I'm always wondering... Does she need me? Or am I the one who needs her? This was my commander's place We once ate here Brother Xiong... Happy birthday! Don't cry It's too long since I watched you perform When you go there tomorrow...

Back then My ma and your dad were often together on stage Lots of people saw them as an ideal couple Back then, my ma was... very beautiful Really very beautiful Lots of men were chasing her But she only had eyes for your dad When he saw me perform on stage, though... he came backstage... to tell me he liked me After that, we were together And I became his aide-de-camp Helped him, took care of him But finally he chose family life and all of you My ma left the opera troupe I felt very down So she arranged for me to get away to perform in Beijing Find the music for "The Battle of Mt.

I have a question for you What is it? I need to ask you... Answer me honestly, no lies! When you were away last night... Who did you sleep with? Mama And Grandpa? Who did he sleep with? Grandpa... He slept with Uncle Cheng'en With Uncle Cheng'en? Fine! Fine! What's wrong? Wait for me, Gran Why? Why? I slaved away for thirty years... for nothing! Isn't he just an old veteran? Earning next to nothing? I made sure all the men of the house... got chicken thigh to eat I'm stuck alone at home... making do with an egg! But never mind! I didn't care! I was willing to put up with it! The kids would come home and ask... why I had nothing but an egg to eat I told them it didn't matter My husband was the one who mattered Their father was the one who mattered Zhang Junxiong, you have no conscience! Absolutely no conscience! You think you're so great if your mother hadn't begged me... to give you a son... why would I have tormented myself like that? And your daughter is just like you! She doesn't care about me Doesn't even look at me! Won't sleep with his wife, but does sleep with a man! He's the only one he cares about Like father, like daughter... they both ran off with other men What's the point of it all? I've wasted thirty years of my life! For what? Ah Feng, what happened to you? What's wrong? What happened to you? Is there something wrong with me? Did someone say something? Everyone is staring at you, don't you see? No, they're all quiet, no-one is saying anything What have I done? Nothing! See for yourself They all know me, they know I'm the Colonel's wife Stop tugging at me! I can't bear to see you like this - Okay? - What do you mean by saying that? I'm perfectly fine I sacrificed my own happiness willingly I put up with it all I married him, I gave birth to the son Women always carry the burden, men don't Just stop it, will you? You'll break the trolley Then I'll buy a new one Just go home I'm here to buy groceries, why tell me to go home? Don't look at me like that What are you staring at? You think I'm crazy? I'm not crazy These people all know me, I'm not crazy Don't be ridiculous Why would I be crazy? If you're not crazy, then tell me... I work myself to death, like a beast of burden... I take care of the old and the young... I do so well looking after them all... that nobody cares a jot for me! What was it all for? They toss me aside, abandon me! What's so great about sleeping with a man? I don't get it Am I so repulsive? Even if I'm repulsive, he lasted thirty years with me Don't keep saying that Is it embarrassing? , stop behaving like that You're acting as if I'm a madwoman Ah Chuan... I'm going home to cook Quick, you go home first I'll bring your grandma I'll get her home She's not herself today Ah Feng! Where are you going? Baby chicken... Come on out! You're actually a baby turkey... But that's close enough to a chicken Get a move on! I'm home What's wrong? Ah Chuan... What's the matter with your Gran? Gran's gone mad What happened? Here you are I can take pictures with this? I have another question There were lots of tadpoles here before So why are there so few now? Growing up means leaving home When its legs are grown, it can leave by itself It turns into a frog and hops away Oh, right... This is how it opens Grandpa... There's no film in it! You don't need any How do you mean? This is useless How can it take pictures without film? What you see through the viewfinder... will stay in your mind You'll remember it Then I might as well just look I'll remember that way too You like tomatoes? You like 'em? I'm telling you All my life, my favorite thing has been... tomatoes So you gotta like them too You know why? Because you're my son Aside from tomatoes, what else do you like? - Lots of things - Lots of things? Such as? I dunno... there are too many Is it your car? Of course it is! Who else's? You like cars? Yeah? Things haven't gone so well for me lately But I have a dream I'll build a big tomato farm Make a fortune! Then I'll buy a great car And take you on trips around the world! That's your old man's dream I can't go. I've still got holiday homework I have to hatch my egg Hatch your egg? That's your homework? Yes, it might die, and not hatch That's so cool! I'm great at hatching eggs I hatched so many chickens when I was a kid Don't worry Just keep the temperature steady, then it'll be fine But my egg is a turkey, not just a chicken They're more or less the same No big difference Must be, right? It'll be fine, just the same as a chicken Satisfaction guaranteed? Who's this "Ah Wen"? It's that guy? That little... Should I call Rat to let him know about it? Sure Haven't we already got this sorted? Why's he still doing it? Okay It's the same Ah Wen? Let me tell you... that issue about turf The trouble you caused... If you want to claim some turf for yourself... ask around about it first And check with us Fill it up! Great! - Are you retarded? - What's this asshole doing here? Did you say "asshole"? - Who's an asshole? - Cool it, we're on the same side Why are you picking a fight with him? He's a fucking asshole Doesn't deserve a place at the table I asked, who are you calling "asshole"? I put up a few signs... He goes to his boss... And then he goes to Brother Dao to rat on me Doesn't that make him an asshole? Stop this bullshit, both of you! - Let's talk this through - Say it again and see what happens!

You want to be boss? I'll see about that! Fuck! She has to eat even if she doesn't want to How else can she survive? She just won't come downstairs Come down to eat You gotta eat I have a question That day... When you took a picture of me with my dad... It doesn't exist, right? What the hell is wrong with you? Do you even know what you're doing? Do you have any idea how long I've been looking for you? I really don't know what you're thinking You had it all A family, a house, children... Then you threw it all away and vanished! It's because I had it all... that I longed for freedom Didn't we see that Truffaut movie together? 'The 400 Blows'? That's the kind of freedom I want Freedom? What right do you have to talk about freedom? How old are you? How can you be so irresponsible? Shouldn't you put your family first? Freedom my ass! I see what it is You watched too many movies, wrecked your brain! Just look at you, you look so ridiculous Going around with that chicken Behaving like a beggar Don't care where you go, where you sleep You don't want 'face', but I do Do you ever think about me and the children? You know how tough it's been for us? All the gossip? Have you ever thought about that? Have you gone mad? If you keep shouting like that... people may think you're the one who's mad Each of us has their own life Can't we just respect each other? You're still young and pretty Why bother being with someone as lousy as me? For the sake of your own future, I think... we should settle for respecting each other So go on your way Where are you going? Won't you come home with me? Let's go home together I've been looking for you for so long Don't go, come back with me Come home with me Listen to me! If you go now... don't bother ever coming back I'll tell your son he has no father! And I'll have no husband! You go, and don't ever come back! Mr Turkey... Don't ever come back! Mr Turkey... Wait for me - Okay - On board? I'll help you You want all this stuff spread in the sunlight? You got lots of things here There's even a book about selling tofu Are you going to sell tofu? Back there, that lady... Is she related to you? All that cursing you, in such a loud voice Ah Chuan, you see that wooden horse? It wasn't always there It was floating in the sea before, just drifting Then I guess... Someone brought it ashore But no-one asked questions and no-one cares Does it really matter where it came from? Where? Liar, it's not hatching! It did move a bit - I didn't see - Excuse me... - Anybody home? - It's not moving at all! Ah Chuan! Yuchang! Come downstairs! Isn't this where you live? Quick! Your dad wants to run off Watch out He won't come inside My dear... Come home... where have you been? The officer has brought you back This is not my home! - This is your home - Not my home!

Don't hit yourself! That same letter again? Time to read it again? Fine, read it slowly From your mother My son Junxiong... When this letter reaches you... I will be at rest with your father Throughout my life... I have always strived to be prepared As they say... Life is unpredictable Now that my life is drawing to a close... I cannot be sure how much longer I will last I might not even be able to speak Or able to move a finger In that case, I wouldn't be able... to pass on my last thoughts You are my son I've pondered this many times... and now I'm writing this testament for you Your mother loves you You were always an obedient child I know you love to dance But I worry that it wouldn't earn you a living You did as your mother wanted... and I was most grateful Your wife Wang Feng... Wang Feng is Gran's name? Yes She's a good-hearted country girl I know that you don't like her But you met my wishes by marrying her I know she will give you lifelong care She's a fine woman I hope you can be a couple like me and your father A loving couple, admired by all I have little to bequeath to you Your wife is a frugal woman, a careful housekeeper She has sacrificed herself for this family Always treat her well Give both children a good education So that when they grow to adulthood... they will be useful to society Then their grandparents in the afterlife... can joyfully accept your offerings And be satisfied in the next world That's the most important thing I wanted to tell you My hope is that my son has a comfortable path in life Your mother, Huiting It really is! The shell cracked! - Are you sure you didn't crack it? - I didn't - I didn't even touch it - It cracked by itself? Is it going to hatch? I think so Really? And when it does...
