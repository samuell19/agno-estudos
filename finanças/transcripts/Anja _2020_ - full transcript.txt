What is it, Andre? Three months with that face. You are distracted, messed up… You passed fifty dirty bottles yesterday. What should I do with you? - What does it mean? - You know what I mean, come on. You want to fire me? I need the money. I need people who don't mess up. Italo got a promotion. What does Italo have to do with it? Italo closes five contracts a month. Here are six hundred… I'll see you tomorrow for the rest. Not in the afternoon, we have that important delivery. Anyway, you speak to Monica, okay? Come on. Put yourself together. There'll be some work for you with the new property. REGISTERED MAIL: DEAR ANDREA GOLUBEV AS OWNER OF YOUR APARTMENT SUBJECT: RENT PAYMENT REMINDER Don't worry… So this guy stands on a wreckage up and down a river. He meets a woman and takes her on the boat. Then there's another man who loads cats and rusty shit. He drinks whiskey all day long and fucks all the whores he meets. Obviously, she starts busting his balls. She complains about her life, the cats smell bad… She also flirts with the other guy, so at the end he sends her to hell. So what does she do? She leaves him! Can you get that bitch? She leaves him like an asshole, he almost loses his job. Who knows what fucking job she was doing, anyway… Holy shit what a movie! It's not insomnia killing us, Andre. It's the night TV! Anyway, I'm sorry for what happened. I'm serious. It's not like we've ever been great friends or so… I need that money. I'm three months back on rent. Come on, you make me feel guilty now. And then I really have a question for you. Where the fuck do you waste your money? You never go out, you don't have a girl… You never do shit! Okay, look… I can help you for one or two months, but let me give you some advice. Leave this place! You live like shit here, I can read it on your face. Tomorrow you come to the factory, you take everything you deserve and leave. Change city, change country, change planet… do whatever you want but leave! Newspapers are already full of bad stories, if you know what I mean. You must decompress a bit… I knew you were here, you son of a bitch! - What do you want from me again? - You even ask? Be quiet, there are people here! So I'll leave your son out there, ok? - Out of the door. Like a dog. - You crazy, where is Sami? Do you have the money? It's a week you owe me the month's pay. There's the food, there's that fucking pool… Go! You do something at least once in your lifetime! You can't bust my balls anymore, got it? I have my life, damn it! I don't give a shit about you and your problems. You come and pick him up tomorrow at the factory. That's fine! But remember the money 'cause I have my life to live. See what happens? - When you marry an asshole? - Go away! That bitch was born to ruin my life, I'm telling you… I didn't even want a child myself. I'm the one to leave one of these days. Fuck! Listen, I'm going swing by the Cosmos. Let's go out and fuck some pussy, come on! - I have other plans tonight. - Yeah… I bet… Do as you like, okay? Oh, Andre? Think about it because you can't go on like this. Oh, good evening, Andre. What we have here this time? 90 Degrees Women. Each time more sophisticated, right? It's none of my business but I speak as a friend. You should try something different. You've been rummaging through the shop for months. You've seen them all by now, haven't you? You only skip faggots' movies. Take a step forward. Like the story of the caterpillar turning into a butterfly. I'm fine with this, thanks. It was my duty to tell you.

It's an exclusive of mine. Want to try it? MEETING ANJA, VOLUME #11 YOUR REAL LOVE GIRL Will you trick us again? Victor will deal with you. CLOSED You want to fire me? You see what happens when you marry an asshole? Go away! SEXY SHOP I'm so sorry, I didn't see you. I don't know what to say, I'm sorry… Let me help you. It's a mess? - It doesn't matter. - I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Can I? It's always like this. I need to be more careful. - It's my fault… I hit you… - Are you kidding? Look… There's a laundry right down the street, I use it all the time. Listen I have to go… really… Wait! Please… I'm not like those girls taking advantage. Please… Okay? It's just five minutes. I arrived here three months ago. I heard about a friend living here, so I took the few things I had and left home. I traveled alone. I always do things alone. You're not from here, are you? No. Where are you from then? I grew up in the north. I am an immigrant too. I was born in Belgorod. My mother was from there. Belgorod? I'm from there too. No, I'm sorry I don't speak Russian. I'm from Belgorod too. There's a big Russian community here, you know? You know Father Ruslan? No. I don't know many people here. And what do you do in life? Water bottling… I was fired yesterday. - I am sorry… I didn't mean to… - Don't worry. And you? Room maid in a hotel. Nothing special. It's ready. Here you go. Almost new. Anyway, my name is Anja. Andre. Now I really have to go, Andre. - It was a pleasure meeting you. - Wait. Listen maybe we can meet again. When? Well, I don't know. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow at the port. At six. Okay? My sister went to college for a couple of years. But I'm a bit like you, I learned from the street. I've been working since I was sixteen. But you should see my sister. She is beautiful. She got married and has two children. She has everything. My parents sent her to beauty contests before they broke up. Why did your parents break up? My father left and my mother never managed to keep a job, let alone a man. I don't even remember my parents. The authorities brought me to Italy when I was a child. They tried to entrust me to someone but I didn't like those people. I've never been one of those people with a normal life. Normality… It's like a bad flu! It is underestimated but it can be lethal. Yeah, go tell them! And you have no friends? A girlfriend? Someone waiting for you? No. No one in particular. That's why you dated me? Men always think I have something special. But I actually have nothing special. I want to put myself together. Maybe move to some tropical place. How about you? What is that you really want? How did it happen? Nothing important. At work. I can help you if you are in some trouble. I know how things can go bad. - It's just something I need to fix, okay? - Wait! Sorry, I didn't mean it. If someone is hurting you… If you need protection, we can call the police. Niet, no police, please. I followed you. On purpose. I… I saw you… I saw you at a corner. I feel so stupid. Do you think I didn't realize it? Stupid. I knew that right away, you know? That you are a good guy. A buoy over my shoulders, and the sea under my feet. I am the only dancer dancing on the waves. We're all on the edge of an abyss, Andre. Our pain is so trivial. You're not like the others. You won't leave me like they did? No. I promise. I'm taking you away from here. Come with me then. How are you doing, my beauty? I know Lùkina since she was a child. Very small. She hasn't changed a bit. I'm grateful God put her on my way again. On the other hand, only God brings together what life separates, isn't that so? Lùkina has always been a quiet, honest girl. But even a calm sea can be very dangerous. Do you want to confess? I'm not a believer. Your eyes, they seem tired. God is always at your side. Let's go. It won't take long, okay? I'll be right back. Anja… Anja… I'm begging you, help me! They want to kill me! - I don't understand. I don't und… - Do you have a car? Please… help… - They found her. - Who? Anja? - Run! - Do you know Anja? Bastard! I'm sure he knows nothing. He has a face of a typical asshole. Go. Calm down! Can't even walk straight, that asshole! We'll see whether Anton likes you. It's hard to please him. Welcome, bitch! - Anton… - So? I know nothing! Don't lie to me, Lena. Don't lie. It's all Lùkina's fault! Right… of course! I know you didn't do anything wrong. I'll disappear forever, Anton. Believe me. My hotel was a home for you, and you let that bitch blow up everything! I could do nothing. Don't lie to me! They've seen you two together. What did she tell you? She… She was trying to leave. I just took the disks to the store as usual. Who's that man, eh? I don't know. - I don't know. - I don't know. You bitch! Viktor found her! Anton! Viktor is here! Shit! Shit! Take her upstairs! Wait here! We still have to finish. Everyday we can decide to make things right. Everyday we can even be born again. This is an offer that we can make you. If you tell us where you hid my disk! Come! They're escaping! Get them, now! They couldn't have gotten far! Look for them outside! And we'll cut off the corridor. Close the staircase! Where are you going? Come with me. There they are! Stop! They are here! - Who the fuck are those people? - Viktor's men… - Who the fuck is Viktor? - Listen, there's no time for this now… There were keys inside Lùkina's bag. - What? - Keys? Hotel keys! Look… I have some money there. Please help me to get it. I can pay you but let's get out of here. Where did they take Anja? - I don't know but she's not in danger. - Where did they take her? She's not in danger, she's important for them. I call the police. Wait you can't call the police! Wait! Would you stop, please? You don't know those people, they kill us if they find us. You still don't understand, do you? You can't call the police. Viktor will immediately know our position. His people are infiltrated everywhere, you know? Listen… I know they are looking for a disk. We have the hotel keys. Maybe they are taking her there. I tell you how to sneak into the hotel, but you take the money for me. You owe me. You'd be dead without me by now. Who is this Viktor? Viktor Bulegov. No one really knows him. Not even his men have ever seen his face. They say he was commander in Chechnya. A beast. He started his business there. Now he controls everything. Weapons, drugs… Everything. This is his new property. Anton runs prostitution for him. Lùkina was shooting videos here, I was just a waiter. What did she do? Why did they take her? They believe she recorded a video of Viktor. She burned it on a disc. She can recognize him, you understand? Give me the keys! Give me the keys! This is the back door key. The security camera doesn't work there. A control room. You go up to the second floor. There is a corridor and then a small room. That's the laundry. Money is under the shelf. Take it! I'll wait for you down the street. Lena? Lena Vasilievna? Lùkina told me to find a video. Who are you? Andrej? This is Ruslan, what are you doing there? Where is Anja? Listen… Lùkina told me to look for a disk. Disk number 11. Lena Vasylieva delivered it to the Pink Room store. You have to find the disk, we have to see it. I know something. Come at the back of church, there is a small warehouse. - Hello? - Hurry up! - Hello? - The door is open. Get him! Hurry! Damn bastard! Come on! God! Come on! Get that bastard! Get that bastard! Get him! Get him! Come on, move! Moron. Where are you? Where did he go? - There he is! - Go, go! I'll get you and kill you! I'll kill you! Move! They found me, I had to run. - Did you get the money? - Not now, not now! Listen to me… I heard Anton talking with a man. He… I think they know where the disk is. He was talking about a factory. Someone is going there. Are you listening to me? It's over! Lùkina will be fine. To them she's business. But we are not. They kill us if they find us. Look… There are trucks at the port, they cross the border every day. I know people there, we can pay them and go. We have to leave the car. When they find the disk they'll come for us. They won't find it. What do you mean? I have the disk. What? You have the disk? I took it at Pink Room. What do you want to do then? - Do you know Father Ruslan? - No! Well, yes. I heard his name. Lùkina used to talk about him. I entered room 121. He called on the phone. - He was looking for you. - For me? He knows something. I'm going to meet him. And you trust him? I found pictures in room 121. - Anja has a son? - I don't want to know. Enough with this bullshit! - You better tell me the truth! - The truth? The truth is that Lukina wouldn't be in this mess, if she was a good mother. - Where is he now? - Who? - Her son. - I don't know, I don't care. - You disgust me! - Listen… The only thing that matters is that you don't trust them. Lukina is not what you think, she… She's just a liar! Get out! Out! What do you think you can do with her? You think a priest can help you against Viktor? I made a promise. I am going to find Anja. If it's the last thing I do. All right. Then give me my money and do whatever you want. I'm going to be at the port at dawn. Hope to meet you there. Viktor's men were not looking for me, they wanted Lùkina. That's why she asked me to protect her. She found a way to leave. Lùkina had money, she gave it to a woman, Lena Vasylieva. She told me about a video. A disk she accidentally took to the store. Lena was the only one to know it was there, that's why Lùkina gave me her phone number. Lùkina managed to film Viktor. She told me he met an important man, his right-hand in the city. They bought a factory, Crystal. They wanted to use it as a diversion. She was terrified they would segregate her. Then they saw her. It's a miracle they didn't kill her. You saw it too, didn't you? That man with the green hat is Viktor's right-hand. I know where to find him. You have to follow him. Do nothing else. The disk you have is our last hope. When you find Viktor, call this number. Ask for me. What did they do to her family? Andrej, I know you are not a believer, but I know you carry some faith in you. Find her. Get her out of there. What was that? Who's there? Go! Go! - Andre, are you crazy? - Where's Anja? - What the fuck are you doing man? - Where's Anja? - What the fuck did you do to her son? - What the hell are you talking about? - Where did you take her? - Who is Anja? If it's for that promotion thing… Okay, I told Dario to… Take me to Viktor! I should shoot you right here, and let your child understand what a shitty man you are. Now you take me to Viktor! Or I swear I'm going to put a bullet in your head, you bastard! Calm down. Calm down. I have to make a phone call. I left my phone in the car. I'll take you wherever you want, just calm down. Go! Go! Samuele is in the car. Try not to screw up. You're out of your mind, you fucking Russian! Out of your fucking mind! - Where's Anja? - Anja? I fucked her back and front. That cunt! - Take me to Viktor. - I'm taking you to Viktor, come. Come, fucking Russian! They should've left you in Russia, instead of pissing us off in our country! You don't know what kind of fucking mess you're in, shitface! You don't even know who the fuck is Viktor! And you're lucky Samuele is in the car. Otherwise it would've ended up really bad tonight! Now I call the police and they'll take care of you. Lucas! Lucas, where the fuck are you? Son of a bitch! - You bastard, I will kill you! - Lucas! I'll kill you, you understand? Where's Anja? Where's Anja? INCOMING CALL HIDDEN NUMBER Where are you? Did you find the disk? I got the disk! You bastard son of a bitch, where's Anja? - Andrej… - Anja! - Andrej, help me please. - Anja! - Anja, it's me! - Do as they say, please. I'll come for you! You bastards! Let her go! I'll wait for you at six, at the port beach. At the port at six! At the port at six! Don't worry. Now… now I take you home, okay? Now I take you home. Don't worry. Samuele! Lucas! Lucas! - What the fuck is going on? - He's going to the port. He took Samuele. Call my wife. Call my wife! Hello? Who's speaking? I need to talk to Father Ruslan! To Father Ruslan! Father Ruslan is not here. Who is it? You have to tell him I'm going to the port beach! That Viktor is going to be there! - I did everything he told me! - He is not here. He is not here. Who is it? I need to talk to Father Ruslan! Hello? I'm Andrej. Andrej Golubev. I did everything he told me, fuck! Andrej. Andrej Golubev. Who's speaking? Andrej, I'm Magdalena. Magdalena Vasylieva. Remember? Magdalena Vasylieva… The director. How are you? Who's number is this? Magdalena, Magdalena Vasylieva… Orphanage 121. Remember? Orphanage 121. I'm Magdalena Vasylieva… The director. Remember? Viktor is here! Why did you let him go? Italo has no faults. He still has a chance to save his son. No, Andrej. No one has possibilities anymore. Not Lena, not Anja. Nor you. Let her go! You tried to save him, Magdalena. But it was only a matter of time. Now there's nothing you can do for him. You never had faith, Andrej. Do you really want to start now? We live an entire life hiding secrets. So go. Come on. Go and see them all. I know you very well, Andrej. I know you because we've always been together. Those afternoons when you were just playing, and you ran, you ran without stopping. Or when you woke up at night and spied on me. And you told it to everyone and they said that a whore cared for you, and that a child was not to live with a person like me. You still didn't know how much hatred was falling on you. And when those men came to collect debts, made for you, to give you a future, and you were crying and crying… You felt it was your fault, spoiled child. You were the cause of all those problems. I knew that sooner or later freedom would come. All that weight would melt in an instant. And when she came to get you, you understood that everything would've been different. That day your fate was revealed forever. I did it for you, Andrej. Forgive me. I made you the man you are now. You come from me, you owe me everything. You've never been what I wanted. Now you'll pay for everything you've done. Throw her in the sea! Don't! Now we are finally equal. Take off the mask, Viktor! You lost another chance, Andrej. You've never been good at anything else. You know where to find Lùkina. You always knew. Run, Andrej. Run. Maybe you can still save yourself. Run. Don't worry, madam, I'll protect you. Follow me. Don't move! Don't move or I'll shoot! A buoy over my shoulders and the sea under my feet. I am the only dancer dancing on the waves. We are all on the edge of an abyss, Andre. Our pain is so trivial.
