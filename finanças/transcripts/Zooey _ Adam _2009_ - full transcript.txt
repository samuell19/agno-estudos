I'm staying in. I'm not going anywhere. Thank you. That will be $50, please. Let's do it second. - You know what I read? - What? That the egg chooses the sex. No, it's the sperm. No, that's not what I read. That's what I always thought, but apparently the egg waits and as all the sperm's around it, and it chooses the sperm. Okay. It lets one sperm enter. Somehow the egg knows which sperm needs to be its sperm. I read that. You have pretty smart eggs. Yeah, my eggs are pretty smart. Huh, I wonder if my parents listened to music when I was conceived, what it would have been. It was probably Joan Baez. Well, either way, the kid is, you know. The kid conceived to this album will be a... You know, an individual weirdo. Which is fine. Solitary soul. - Who's not afraid... - Loyal. Who's not afraid to fuck up and frequently does so. - But still is well loved. - By hippies. Could I ever imagine your parents doing it to music? Probably Anne Murray. So? How did that one rate? It's hard because the environmental factors. You know, it was hot. - It was hot, so hot. - A little too hot. But that wasn't our fault. - You want to know, I know. - Yeah, I'd like to know. It's off the charts, because, you know, we're not doing it for pleasure, purely for pleasure. What are you talking about? I mean, there's pleasure involved. I don't think, you know, when you submit my overall ratings to the powers that be, I don't want these included on it. Definitely over 5, right? How come I can tell you, but you can't tell me? No, I'm not gonna tell you. Why do you always have to do this? I think, in situations like this, we should concentrate on quantity, not quality. So do you enjoy quantity? This was the first one of the day. That's as far as I'll go. How did that guy...? We passed that guy before, and he multiplied and turned into three people. This meteor, what's it look like? A piece of burning rock. No, but now, like, do they have it somewhere? Well, it's at the bottom of the lake. Seven. Seven months. It was right after I opened the store. What? It means that I can graduate early, and so then I could start working. And maybe we can move. Because I know that it's getting frustrating living right downtown like that. It sounds great. Where do I sign? It means I'd be gone again for... - All right. - On and off for about a six-month period. You'd be the resident hot girl in the tent, eh? Thanks for listening to me. I ramble on. What were you saying? Nothing. Go on. Go on. There's a really good spot over here. I don't want to fall off a cliff. Wouldn't it be awesome? It would be so awesome. - If we fell off a cliff? - Yeah, hm. Imagine conceiving the baby in freefall. Mm, mm-hm, mm-hm, never to be born. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. I just get scared that maybe, you know, what if I've I've never had a sperm count or gotten anyone pregnant before. - You know? - Yeah. I feel like. I don't want to talk about that anymore. You need me just like I need you, right? I do need you. Do you really? I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't think so. Thank you. It's true. Ah, busted! What are you guys doing up so late? Hey, sweetie, how you doing? Be cool, buddy. What? Yeah, we're fucking cool. Where did you guys come from? - What's the problem? - No problem, guys. - No problem. - We were just getting licked. My buddy Chad, he had a rough night. - Well, that's too bad. - Rough fucking day. Fucking bitch dumped me. - You know how it goes. - Yeah. Yeah, but you guys know how to party, right? We want to show him a good time. Where's the fucking hot dogs? We're not partying tonight. Not partying? It's 3:00 a.m.! Why aren't you partying? - No. - What are you doing up? We came a little off the beaten path, Have to party, you know? Well, we came off the beaten path too, right? I want to see what's in the tent. Guys. Hey, hey, don't go in there. Don't go in there. Yeah, what's in the tent? You guys should just move on, please. - Move on? - Yeah, guys. That's kind of rude, don't you think? Where's the fucking welcome here? Excuse me? What, you got a problem? I don't have a problem. Why you want us to move on then if you don't have a problem? Why don't we just sit down and have a nice friendly drink together? We're trying to have a nice time too. Not very nice of you to send us on our way, huh? - Looks, guys... - What the fuck makes you so good, huh? I don't have a problem with you. I hope you guys are having a really fun night. Does it seem like he's got a problem? - What do you think, Chad? - I hope you guys... You think he's got a problem? I think he's just a rich fucking kid who has his piece of fucking ass, and we got shit. Is that what it is? He thinks he's better than us. You think you're better than us? - Is that what it is? - I don't think anything. Chad, you know why you're here, man. I think that's what you think. - Is that what you think? - That's it. No, guys. Guys, I think you really got to go right now, okay? - Let's just go. - You want to go? I'll tell you where we want to go. We want to go for a little date with your girlfriend is where we want to go. Hey, get your fucking hands off me! Get your fucking hands off me, you son of a! Fuck you! Hey, hey, get off her! Fuck, fucking get off her! - Give it to her, Chad. - Get off her! - Show her who's the boss. - Son of a bitch! - Hold her! - Get off her! - Fuck you! - You got her? Fuck you! Get the fuck off her right now! - Fuck that bitch right! - Fuck you! - Get the fuck off! - Get off her! Fuck you! Go ahead, scream. - No one's gonna hear you! - How is that, Chad? How does that feel, huh? She feels good. No, fuck you! Get off me! How's that, how's that? Yeah? Get off her, please, please. Hurry the fuck up, Chad. Fucking faggot, finish it off. Get off her! That's why you came, Chad. And how do you spell Zooey? As Zed, Z-O-O... Mm-hm. - E-Y. - And your last name, Zooey? Havelang, H-A-V-E-L-A-N-G. We're married. Okay, you guys are married? Yeah. And how long have you been married? Half a year. Yeah, almost a year. Now I'm gonna be asking some questions that may not be very comfortable for you, but to the best of your abilities, you need to answer them truthfully, all right? Yeah, one guy held me and the other two... Just kind of... You know, we fought, and the altercation. And then they... Okay, to what extent? Was there penetration? Yes. Okay, so his penis actually entered inside you? - Yeah. - All right. Do you remember at all whether he was wearing a condom or not? Definitely not. Where are you when this rape is occurring? I was right there. How far are you? About 10 feet. Do you have a visual of what's happening? Do you have to look ahead? Have to look at the sides? Or are you just hearing some things? I first he, I was... Um, at first, I was able to look. I was trying to get away from the guy, and he held onto me. And I was able to see not very much. And then he pulled me back, and threw me on the ground by the tent. And I could just hear. Were you being held down while this was happening? Mm-hm. If you are wishing to proceed with criminal charges, which I think is the case here... Ahem, uh... Yeah. Yeah. Um, I just haven't really had a chance to really, um... If they have no history of doing this before, how would you proceed? A lot of times, people tend to talk about what they've done. Criminals like to brag. And we want to act immediately on it, and like my partner said, alert the necessary people and the public. And hopefully get them. Shouldn't camp out in the middle of nowhere all by themselves. It's important to know, though, it wasn't you guys' fault, you know? Not at all. - Hey. - Hey, Zooey. How's it going? Okay. How about you? Fine. Sorting through all these papers. Got a lot of work? Yeah, yeah, Thanks so much for having us. - It was really great. - No, I need to go home. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm so tired, yeah. Well, where did you guys park? Oh, we're just in the parkade. Yeah, thank you. Do you want me to walk with you? No, we're good, thank you very much. See you soon? Okay. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. We have to walk all the way up there. I don't know why that one would be open and this one isn't. Just want I want to do right now. Have fun tonight? Yeah, you? I just, I don't really feel like cleaning and doing dishes and stuff like that these days, and you're always gone. It seems so easy for you to go. I'm sorry, I'll stay. I'll stay home, I'll call in. Just call in sick. It's like I can't even look at you. I can't even look at you. You just look so pathetic, just that, like: "Please, please, be better, please be better." You just want me to, like... What do you expect me to do? What do you want me to do? Not have been such an asshole and decided to go up to the middle of nowhere and fucking set up in the bush and take off our clothes. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, what? - Look at me. - I just want to go home. Look at me, Zooey? No, I don't want to look at you. Zooey? I'm a week late on my period, and I didn't take the fucking pill in the hospital. You didn't take it? No, I didn't fucking take it, so chew on that for a second. Why didn't you take it? Zooey, why didn't you take it? Because I didn't want to lose our baby. Oh, my God, what if I'm pregnant? I can't even function. I don't know what to do with myself. Adam, what if I'm pregnant? What if I'm pregnant? Surprise. We can find out if it's mine. What if it's not? What would you want to do? You're so diplomatic. Isn't it your choice? Isn't it supposed to be your choice? Am I being diplomatic, or am I being kind and considerate? Yeah, I guess you're being kind and considerate. They did say it's up to me whether or not I wanted to press charges, so maybe if I decide. I mean... What do you mean, like, it's up to you? It's, seriously? So you have to decide? - Wow. - If I want to... - Yeah. - Exactly. Yeah, I have to decide. I'm the one who has to go on trial and, yeah, see them in court and testify against them and... Would you like me to come with you? If you need me, like, for anything, we can definitely be there for you, you know? Thank you so much. Hey, sweetie. - Aw! - Thank you for the kiss. Aw. Thank you. Aw. Sharon? Okay, hi. So nobody's called you about any of the blood tests yet, eh? Okay, that's probably because they're normal. Because we see so many patients a day, we can only call, really, for abnormal tests. Your baseline serology for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were negative. Then I took a pregnancy test a couple of days ago. Okay. Now, in terms of your past obstetrical history, have you ever been pregnant prior to this latest episode? Yeah, yeah, I, um, I had a unwanted pregnancy when I was 18, which I terminated, yeah. Okay, and other than that, any other previous pregnancies? - No. - No. Just wondering about paternity and the possibility of... - Finding out who's... - Yeah. And even if that's something that would be? My understanding, and my apologies, because, of course, I'm not a geneticist myself, is that they would be doing a chorionic villus sampling, but that wouldn't necessarily be an option right now. It would be later on in the pregnancy that you would be that test to determine the genetics of the baby. How much later would that be? You know, I would probably have to go and page a gynecologist to discuss it with them or just call genetics on call. But it would seem me to be around 12 weeks. .5 to 1% incidence of miscarriage. So that would be a risk that you would be taking with the test. If they did the test and you went on to miscarry, if would be impossible to know for certain whether that miscarriage was something that was inevitable or whether it was related to the test. It's so sad to. I know. Okay, and this is the container. This is the sterile one. Okay. It seems suspect that you would want to hide it from me. Why? I wasn't hiding it from you. I just wanted to get it done, and get it off to the lab. What do you mean, "unnecessary"? It's, like, the simplest... Well, it's not gonna answer any of the questions for us. - It might. - No. If it's zero, if I don't have any sperm working, then we know it's not mine. It's a simple way of narrowing it down. I'm sorry if I haven't been very easy to talk to. It's okay. Neither have I. So you really want to do this, eh? Yeah. How are you gonna do it? The old fashioned way. Do you need some help? Maybe. Okay. Was that bad? What's wrong? It's not your fault. Yes, it is. I'm sorry. No, no, it's not your fault. - It's my fault. - I'm really sorry. You just have to, if you could, I just need you to be a little bit more aggressive maybe. It's just not working. Sorry, I just, maybe we... Maybe we can try later. Let's try again now, come here. Just... You're not attracted to me anymore? Of course I am, of course I am. Then why isn't it working? I don't know. Don't take the test. Why not? Why not? What's wrong? I want to have the baby. And I don't want to take any tests. I I don't want to have his baby. Why do you have to think of it as his baby? It's my baby. I know. It's our baby. I believe that. It's a baby. This is something we can do to make all of it ours. What if it's not ours? If it's not mine, it's not mine. It's ours if we decide it's ours. - We could get pregnant again. - Yes, a horrible thing... We could get pregnant again. I'm 30 years old. I know, I know, but 30 is not the end. And I'm not prepared to let go. What if we take the test and you find out it's definitely his? I still want it. How could you? I want a baby. It doesn't matter whose baby it is? It's my baby. What if you look at him? I don't remember what he looks like, so don't even go there. - Maybe he'll remind you. - No. You'll see my face. I might see, I don't know what I'll see. Why are you obsessing over him? - Because... - Forget that! That's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about! No, we're not. We're talking about a baby, a baby that is growing inside me right now. I know. That is alive and that didn't do anything wrong, and that we could raise, Adam. I cannot... What can you not do? Tell me what you cannot do, and I'll tell you what I cannot do. I can't look at a baby's face that looks like him, because I remember what he looks like, okay? I remember what he looks like, and I'll never forget. And I don't want to do that. I don't understand how you can want to. How could you possibly look... How could you possibly look at this as if it doesn't matter? As if it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. No. Don't, don't, don't. - Zooey. - A baby. I want to know, okay? I want to know. Okay, then you know, and then what? And then we go from there. Then we decide. - Then we... - Just say it. What, you want me to say, "Have an abortion"? Mm-hm, that's what you would want me to do? It's an option. What are the other options? I cannot believe that you are talking this way. How can you, how can you possibly want this? It's the, it's... We can't do anything about that. We can do something about this. - Yes, we can, exactly. - Yes! And the thing to do isn't forget that this happened! What if it grows up and it turns out to be his baby, and it turns out like him? Then what? Then how could you possibly live with yourself? - We are going to raise it. - You couldn't. You couldn't live with yourself. Then you would, then you would regret it for the rest of your life, - and so would I. - No, I wouldn't regret it. Yes, you would. No, you know what I would regret? Having an abortion because my husband forced me to do it! I'm not... Because my husband was chicken and scared. I would not force you! How could? I don't understand why you wouldn't want to. You've done it before! I'm... No, you can't just pull that shit. You can't... Just because I bring up something that I haven't experienced, doesn't mean we can't talk about it, okay? Like reasonable people. You always do this. You're not being reasonable. You always do this. Maybe not, but neither are you. You're walking away just because, oh, suddenly, I'm a man, I can't possibly understand this, - and fuck you. - That's not what I said. That's what you're doing. Because I'm not gonna know the answer. But you do know that it's a possibility. What I do know is that right now, I want to have a baby. I'm pregnant, therefore, I am going to have this baby. And I love you, and I want you to have it with me! You can't expect me... No, I can't expect you. I'm asking you. The thing that happened to us. I'm asking you to let go of it, and I'm asking you to believe that this baby is yours like I have. And it's been very hard for me to believe. I know that. And I'm asking you to help me through this pregnancy and this birth and to be with me for the rest of my life. Okay. Okay. Simple as that. See, it's why I love you. There's also part of you, and tell me if I'm getting this wrong, that's hanging on to the, "Oh, but, you know", "what if we did the test and got the answer we want?" I'm not, it's not like it's something I'm not willing to let go of. It just keeps on bothering me. Adam, when you say it's something that's bothering you, it's kind of like it's doing it against your will, like there's this nagging doubt, and it just keeps coming into your mind, even though you don't want it to. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, I would say that's true. Yeah. "Hey, there's this thought that pops into my mind" "and I don't want it to." "It bothers me." "I see Zooey not being bothered by it," "and I wish I could be not bothered by it." - Yeah. - Um... And I think that's something that you can do more, and be less bothered by. And I think that's something that the two of you can, the two of you can help you with that. And it seems to me that spending some time helping you be a little more in charge for how much that, thoughts come into your mind, and helping those thoughts be... Because it sounds like those thoughts are a bit in charge. - Yeah. - All of us need help with that sometimes. Sounds like she's willing. How do you feel? He had a very gentle voice. I felt like I was gonna break him if I raised my voice, so I didn't. It was good, though. Yeah, it was better than I thought it would be. Hi, do you have any questions? Maple? Yeah, this is eastern hard-rock maple. I do all my work in eastern hard rock. You make it yourself? Yeah, everything you see here. And that's with the maple. If we went down to oak... No, no, maple. Okay, yeah, that would be 48. Could you come down a bit on that for a large order? How large? 60. 60? Yeah, I could, I could... It takes about three weeks to do something like this. = Okay. Two years I think I could probably get it done in less than that. Less than that? Well, let's not bite off more than we can chew here. Well, it's an estimate, you know? Okay. But I think I can safely say two years would be fine. Um... What's wrong? It's okay. Adam, can you come here? Huh? My water broke. I don't know. I think it's a little further on. - It's near the... - I don't now, I was just... Okay, um... No, further on. Further on. I know, I know, I know. I'm just thinking that there's a section. Does it say at the beginning? It's right here. Okay, so you're supposed to squat. Get some toilet paper. Squat. Like, you got to squat. Full squat, full squat. Okay, but you have to hold me. Support me, I can't do it myself. Okay, I'm doing it, I'm doing it. Okay. Now what? Now is it dripping? - Yes. - Okay, okay. - What does that mean? - That means your water broke. Okay, okay, you can stand up. Okay, what color is it? - What color is it? - What color? What are the different colors it can be? What does it say? Is that green? Green? What color is that? Well, what are the different colors that it says it an be? Well, it can be clear, or it can be, like, yellow. If it's brown or green, that's not good. Well, I don't think it's brown. It's definitely not brown. Well, there's yellow. Well, I mean, pee color? Pee is yellow. I know it's... That's yellow, that's just yellow. That's okay? What happens if it's brown or green? That's good, that's fine. If it's brown or green, it's really bad. Well, thank God. Adam, I need you to help me out, please. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Please? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay, we've got to get you dressed now. - Yeah. - Then we got to go. You haven't had any contractions? No. Okay, they're right here. Thank you. What was I just thinking? - Here, here's a hanky. - Thank you. Why do I need a hanky? I don't know. Okay. Are you okay? Oh, my God, okay. I'm so fucking thirsty. Come on, we got to go, Zooey. My clothes are right here. You should put them on. Did you check in your "yesterday" pants? Usually leave them in your back pocket. These are yesterday's pants. They're right here. Yeah, turn it off. Is the back door locked? You should check that. Um, good. Shh, it's gonna to be fine. Oh, Adam, let me do it. Oh-oh, oh-oh, someone's awake. - Shh, I know, I know. - Oh, sweetheart. He knows you're trying to give it to him. He doesn't want it. He doesn't want it. What's the matter? Look, go to bed, go to bed. One person can do this job, okay? Well, you're not doing the right thing. What am I doing wrong? I, you're not doing anything in particular wrong. - I just... - Shh. I just, oh God. Shh. Why won't he just stop crying? - No, he's not. - Yes, he is, look. - Adam, he's... - He's on his side. Okay, okay, would you just stop, please? - Adam... - I know what his side is. I know what his side is. You just please...? All the more reason for him to get to know his daddy. Come on, come on. Adam, just give me my baby. "My baby"? Come on. You know what I mean. You know what I mean. Shh. Shh. Shh. Hey, Jeff, it's Adam. Well, the deal is, um. I can't get... And then pay the rest when the guy pays me Oh, come on. Yeah, if these are gonna be, like, on display to, like, a whole bunch of potential clients, this will be huge. This will totally change everything. Yeah, well, um... Yeah, what is that? Well, do you think, like, would he be able to tell the difference? Yeah. You're positive? Mm-hm. Okay, if I could get you to sign here. If you'll follow me, I'll escort you back out of the secure area. It's okay, it's okay. It was an accident, Carl. Carl, it was just an accident, Carl. Shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Mommy doesn't need to fold laundry. - Mommy needs to fold. - Mommy doesn't need... Mommy needs to be a good mommy, and good mommies organize things around the house. - Mommy is a good mommy. - Good daddies help. Daddy is helping. You're not helping, actually. Yes, I am. People get babysitters. Everybody does, for a reason: Because they need to spend time together. Even if we had a babysitter, I wouldn't want to have sex. It's not just about sex. Really? He's one year old, he needs our full attention. Yeah, but he's sleeping. He doesn't need folded laundry. But there's stuff that I need to do. He doesn't care if his laundry's folded or not. Adam, don't do that. Why not? Parenthood, you do not give up who you are to be a parent, okay? I'm not giving up who I am. What are you? I am becoming fully who I am. Yeah, you're spending two weeks out of the month up north... - Oh, for fuck's sakes. - And that's fine. That's fine, that's who you are. Don't bring that up. You know I don't want to do that, and I have to because it's a good job. - And the rest of the time... - We have this new house. You're devoted Carl. Okay, what about sex? - What? - I'm still breastfeeding. He's one year old. You're gonna be breastfeeding for another year. Tons of stress. Some people breastfeed until their kids are six. I just don't feel like it. I need more. Adam, what do you mean by that? I need, I need more. Um, yes, is this Adam? Adam, this is Kent Suss calling from ABC Daycare. I'm calling about your son, Carl. He's fine, yes. He's sitting with me here in the office. How is he? Holy shit, you scared me. I'm sorry. My God, what are you doing here? Did they call the cell? Well, they called me at work, yeah. Oh, my God. He's fine. Just like he was trying to be so nice as he told me that my son injured another child. He has a little Band-Aid on, he's bleeding and everything. - You saw the kid? - Yeah. I guess the two of them were playing, and somehow Carl got a hold of a sharpened pencil. What is that doing around children? Feel pretty good about yourself, eh, Carl? Caw-wol. Somehow we are not giving him something that he needs. We're not teaching him something. Maybe. Because it can't be his fault. It's not his fault. Oh, God. Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay, we're done. We're done. See, that wasn't so hard. Well, that sounds great. Yeah, um, so how are we gonna work with the payment? Is there any chance I can get an advance this week? I, I... Oh, yeah? Yeah, Carl was brought down to the office again. Fighting with another kid and yelling at the teacher so... Today you come and you're laughing and you're joking and you're in a good mood, and I only ever see you like that when he's not around. And that breaks my heart. Can we not do this? I know. I don't want to do it either. This is all we do. This is all we do anymore. Are you still with Susan? Uh, no, that, uh... That didn't end very well, but... - Really? - Yeah. - Sorry to hear that. - Well, that's okay. I was, I think it was better for everybody. I think. I just think her heart was elsewhere, and so I called her on that and... It's hard to do. I guess so, but sometimes things just get to a point where, you know, you say to yourself, "Why am I doing this?" "Why am I putting myself through this?" "Why am I looking at myself in the mirror every night" "when I go to bed and looking at myself and going." "What are you doing here?" "You're miserable." Yeah. - No, I did not screw you. - Really? I was not able to get that quantity of eastern hard rock, so I had to go with another kind of maple that is just as good. And when did you find this out? Well, some time ago. I didn't think it was worth bothering about. So you didn't decide it was worth telling me? No, Brian, because it is just as good. I mean, you saw the tables yourself. Bullshit, stop talking. Stop talking now and listen. This is the way things work. I'll give you 'till Monday to get me the sixty tables I asked for and I signed for. Well, y-you know I can't do that, Brian, I need... - Brian, this is... - You agreed to. I know I should have talked to you, but this is three years of work. And I, I really... Um, I, I can't, I can't afford to just... You screwed me on this. You made an ass out of me. You're blowing this way out of proportion. You're blow... God, okay, I'm sorry, Brian. You will never work in this town. Your reputation is shit, all right? Your reputation is shit. Brian, can I'm sorry, can you hold one second, please? - Just one second, I'm sorry. - Are you serious? Just one second. You're... Hello? Tree House. Um, yes, is this Adam? Yes. Adam, this is Kent Suss calling from ABC Daycare. I'm calling about your son, Carl. What did he do? Carl, I want to talk to you! Listen to me! Carl, how many times have we told you this? - Never! - Hey, stop it! No, just listen! - No! - Carl, stop it! No! Do not push. Carl! - No! - How many times...? Hi, Carl. What's going on? What is going on, Adam? Hello. What's wrong, Carl? Come here. [Carl grunting) Hey Carl, do you want... What the fuck? Sorry. What happened? He was really bad at school, and I tried to talk to him about it, and he just wouldn't listen. He's a child, you were shaking him. - I wasn't shaking him hard. - Yes, you were. You were shaking him. You weren't shaking him very hard? You're not supposed to shake him at all. It's, like, I I just lost control for a second, and... It's not the first time. I know. He ran away from me! He ran away and hid. Why would he hide from me? I don't know. What's goes on when I'm not here? - Nothing. - Do you scare him? No, I don't. I feel like I don't even know who the hell you are anymore. Zooey, that's ridiculous. Why do you get angry with him? - What has he done? - I don't know. What has he done to make you so angry at him? He just does things. He does bad things, and then he won't pay attention to anything else. It's not like I haven't tried other things. So it's his problem? He's got something that's wrong with him? I didn't say that. And I didn't mean that. Where are you going? How did you get that? It came to our door. How did you get that? It came to our fucking door. And they just gave it to you? I signed for it. Why did you do this? I don't have to answer that. You don't have to answer that? Yes, you do. You don't get to do this. We had a deal. We had a deal! Fuck, Zooey, Zooey, give it to me. - No. - Give it to me right now. No, we had a deal, fuck you. - Give it to me, Zooey. - Is he your son? Yes, he's my son. Why did you need this if you really believe that? How. I wanted to know, Zooey. - I hate you right now. - Why is that so hard to understand? No, Zooey, no, no! No, Zooey. No, drop it. - Zooey, no, don't do it. - We had a deal, fuck you. Drop it, Zooey. Zooey? You don't believe he's yours! Zooey, drop it. Zooey! Don't you see he's yours when you look at him? He's yours! Zooey, just let go of it. How could you do this? I hate you! Let go of it, Zooey! Zooey, let go of it right now! How can you expect me not to, eh? Because I thought I knew you, and we had a deal. How can you look at him and not think he's yours? Zooey, Zooey? I want you to go. I want you to go. You want me to tell him? Tell him what? Three of us can sit down together. That's it? No, that's not it. It's obviously not it. But it's what's happening now. You can't be serious! I am serious. I'm really serious. That's ridiculous, it doesn't even... Stop telling me I'm ridiculous! Stop telling me what I say is ridiculous. - God damn it. - I'm so. I'm really sorry that there was another fight today, okay? But it's not gonna happen anymore, because Mom and Daddy have been talking, and Daddy's gonna move out, okay? He's gonna go live somewhere else for a while. All right? So there won't be anymore, sweetheart? Shh, give me a hug. Carl? Carl, where are you going? We talked about you walking away from me when I'm talking to you. Sweetheart, stop. Carl, look at me. And I'm afraid the results that were mailed to me were lost. Yeah. It's WPG6368, Adam Morris. What do you mean? What's an information hold? An information hold is when can call us, and they can have the information withheld. But I was told that with... If it wasn't a legal test, if it was just for information, then I didn't need permission of all parties. So did, did my wife call you and request... Hi, you've reached Zooey and Carl. Please leave a message for us. Thanks very much. You... You can't keep me from talking to Carl. You know that, don't you? I just want to be able to talk to you both. And I really don't think it's... Well, just give me a call. What did she do with them? I mean, does she still have them and... She destroyed them. She destroyed them, okay. So you're not gonna get those results unless that company can reproduce them for you. - Okay? - Yeah. She says she didn't read them. Didn't read them, okay. I think to spend $400 an hour on a lawyer to try and get the results of a, you know, test that cost less than $200 just doesn't really make sense. I am concerned that you could sort of make things worse. You know, sometimes we think we want to know something, and then we find out, and, you know, you wish that you never... - You know... - I took this test because I wanted to know. You don't think that I haven't been thinking about this for four years? Five years almost. Well, I'm sure that that, you know, that has presented some difficulties for you, but I think that you should really consider... What do you mean, it's presented difficulties for me? Well, you know, clearly, you're upset. You know, I apologize if you think that I'm speaking out of turn, but it really is part of my duty as counsel. I really, strongly suggest that seek counseling for yourself and counseling for you and your wife, and... Who the hell are you to tell me that I should be taking counseling? Well, you've come to me to seek advice. I've come here for legal advice, which you're not giving me. You're telling me you're just gonna charge me however much money, and that you can't do anything for me. And then you're telling me that I should go see counseling? Well, thank you very much. I've been to counseling. I've been to a lot of counseling. And it hasn't helped me any more than you have, okay? You know what? - I would appreciate it if... - Hold on, the first thing... Hold on, let me finish. I say that not out of just a sense of professional duty, but I can see it. I can say objectively... What can you see? Tell me what you can see. Legal help is not what you really need at this point. What you really need is a qualified family therapist. Yeah, thanks very much. Oh, off we go to work today! Yeah! Three people dead, one person taken to hospital. Zooey and Carl. Please leave a message for us. Thanks very much. Hey, Zooey. Stripper Jamboree, I don't even know what that means. One after another. It's like 10 of them. Hey, you want to roll it forward? Didn't get out of there 'till 1:00. Hang on. You got it? Okay. Hey. This is a heavy son of a bitch. Hey, hey, hey, guys, put it down, put it down. What, what's up, man? Put it down. - Put it down. - What's the problem? Put it down. Oh, not this way! Tip it up, tip it up. Tip it up, God damn it, Jesus! Hey, man, you don't need to swear at us, all right? - Just... - Yeah, well, this is a $2000, chest of drawers, and you just put it down on its handles. Yeah, and you can't afford it, so I'm gonna move it out, all right? Don't talk to me that way. Just do your fucking job, okay? Yeah, I am doing my fucking job, all right? Yeah, well, you're not doing it too fucking well, are you? What do you think you're better than me, man? Put it down. Put it down. We don't need to fucking take this shit. What the fuck did you say to me? I said, do you think you're better than me? - Fuck you, fuck you! - Hey, what the fuck, man? Fucking... Want me to smash your fucking drawers right here? Fuck you! I'll fucking kill you! Yeah, you're gonna fucking kill me? Man, settle down. Why does this keep happening to me? I No! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck fuck! We're on it, we're on it. Crash! Tell you how long it's going gonna take Nice. - Mainframe crashed again. - I'm reconnecting the original terminal. Don't answer that. Taking the main jobs offline. Not answering anything. Rerouting the... Rerouting the access protocol path to the original drive. - Disable these. - Codes we spend three fucking days synchronizing. Not answering any of those. Designing a new network master. Not even dreaming of answering any phones and... I don't feel good about you being alone with. I've been thinking a lot about Carl, and I just. I'm sorry, if I'm screwing this up. I really want to come over for, thank you, yes, I would love to come over for supper, and that's what I meant to call about. Why don't you call me? You've got my number. Just give me a call, and we can figure out when, when I can come over. I'm free anytime. Um, okay, bye. Let's try that. I don't use it much for anything anymore. I got rid of the shop. Yeah? 'Cause um, well, it didn't go so well. That's a bummer. Yeah, so, you know, that's why I was hoping I could, you know, sell stuff online. Uh, and I got a few others down here. Reciprocating saw, compound miter saw. Nice. Jigsaw, sabre saw, scroll saw. Ban saw, chainsaw. Chainsaw is what I use usually, yeah. - Yeah. - But she won't mind? No, no, she shouldn't, no. Yeah, this looks really great. Just make sure you wear gloves, 'cause there's a nasty squirrel that lives in here too. Who are you? I'm Andrew. You must be Adam. Yeah, hi, Carl. You're the Andrew from up north? Yes, that would be me. I see. Well, nice to meet you finally. Nice to meet you. Nice one. How you doing? You left. Yeah, I did. So you're not coming back, go. - Does Andrew live here now? - Yep, he does. Is that true? You live here now? From time to time, yeah. Man, you did that one low! You did that one late. Hey, it's a party out here! Yeah. How you doing? I'm sorry, I was gonna tell you at dinner tomorrow. Tell me what? He's that kind of friend. Yeah. Right. You're not upset? No. I mean, it's a surprise, but, you know, he seems like a nice guy. - It's understandable. - Okay. Maybe I should go. Are you serious? - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. Yes, young Skywalker. You've taken off my cloak. He can't laugh if he's crushed by a meteor. Tonight? Tonight it mustn't have been a real meteor. I have to be there in minutes. [Carl laughing) - Can you call him? - No, he's going to... I'm supposed to meet him at some park and talk to him in his car for 20 minutes. I have no way of getting a hold of the guy. What's wrong? I have a meeting tonight with that guy from that quarterly to ask him, what are you doing right now? Taking care of Carl. Can you hang on for like, 45 minutes? Andrew, what? After all the stuff you told me about what was going on with Adam and Carl... It's 45 minutes. It's minutes, they've been doing fine. That's because we're here. What's gonna happen when we go? It's fine, okay? Are you absolutely sure? Okay, have fun, good luck. I'm just gonna drive her. I'm gonna be back really soon. - Go! - You guys just play, okay? - Thanks, buddy. - Go. - Zooey, let's go. - It's okay, I'll clean up. - We'll clean up. - No, no, no, just leave it. Just leave it, just leave it, just leave it. No, we'll clean up. Ah! Carl just volunteered to clean up! And so that might help, um, stop his parole? What? I thought he was supposed to be in there for seven years. That was the maximum. This is the information as it was listed on his request for a parole hearing, so... Well, why would he want to move here? I mean, that's where... You know, that's where the victims of his crime live. Why wouldn't he just go back home? When, when when, when's he gonna go free? Likely the parole hearing will be sometime tomorrow. He could be out as early as tomorrow. And so what can I do? How can I, how can I, how can I get a, um, an order? Oh, um... What the fuck? "What the fuck"? Yeah. Well, look who it is. What are you talking about, man? What the fuck's your problem? Oh, what, you don't remember me? No, I don't remember you. What the fuck, you're some tough guy? How could you fucking forget? What the fuck is wrong with you, man? You fucking go away for three years, and then you're gonna come back. And now what are you gonna fucking do? You're fucking nuts, man. What do you think I'm gonna fucking do now, huh? You think I'm just gonna fucking let you walk all over me, you motherfucker? You think you can fucking do that to me? What the fuck are you talking about? You think you can fucking do that to my wife? Hey, you son a bitch! - How do you think... - You son of a bitch! Who the fuck do you think I am? You know who you fucking are. Back off. Back off! How about fucking up my life? How about fucking up my marriage? - Why did you come here? - Hey, hey! Why did you come here, to find me? I was just walking down the street. What, do you want to finish the job? - You want to do it again, huh? - What are you talking about? You're fucking nuts! Well, I found you, Carl, huh? What do you fucking think of that? I'm not Carl. I don't know who the fuck you're looking for. - What? - No, I'm not Carl! Fucking right. I can do that meteor thing. What time we have to be there? - 15 minutes. - All right. Yeah, I'm just gonna go get the car. Mm, thank you. See you later? Where is it? It's right underneath the sink. Daddy will help you find it later. Where is it? Mom? Later, we'll find it later, okay? Carl, when Dad says it's bedtime, you go to bed, okay? Dad! Okay, there he is, see ya. - Bye. - Bye. Hey. What was that for? Let me go! I'll be respectful! Let go, I won't do anything. I promise. - Yeah? - Yep. Okay. There she was! That way or that way! But it's more than just weird, Zooey. It's like there's, there's this undercurrent of darkness. I don't really think it's really for you to say. I'm sorry, I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything, but... Uh, really, I don't understand why you're being so hard. I mean, you don't really know him very well, so it's kind of hard for you to say. I don't know how you can't see this. I mean, let's take tonight. Tonight, Adam, was more out there than I've ever seen him. I mean, he was... You make him sound like he's crazy. Do you want to cut the dinner short and... Adam? Adam? Adam? What the fuck? This the kind of shit I was talking about. Carl's not in his bed either. - What the fuck? - Is there a note somewhere? Adam Morris or Carl Morris has arrived in emergency anytime over the past... No? You checked all of them in the city? Okay, thank you. Okay, well, that's good. Hi, Adam, it's me, um... If they're not there, is there somewhere else that they might have gone? His parents'? Your parents'? I know, did he like to go somewhere with Carl? Did they have a place? Did they have a hangout joint? But I don't know why he wouldn't leave a message on my phone to tell me. And why would Adam not be here? What's the meteor game? What meteor game? Earlier tonight, Carl and Adam were talking about the "meteor game," and Adam asked Carl if he wanted to see a real meteor. Before we left, you heard him saying that? Is that something they do? No. Zooey? Do you know where they are? Oh, my God. Zooey, what? Oh, fuck, I'm such an idiot. What is going on? Will you come with me tonight? Yeah, anywhere, where... We need to drive out to West Hawk. - West Hawk Lake? - Yes, right now. Getting close. The comet's here. Come on, keep going. - Keep going. - It's right up there. - Yeah? - Yeah? Can we go to the end of the trail and see the meteor? That's exactly where we're going. Yeah, we're gonna get there pretty soon. Okay, that's his car. Yeah, this is it. This is it. - You sure? - Yes. Just leave the lights on, 'cause Carl might see them. - Carl? - Okay, okay, Adam? Now we get to play the game, Carl. Yay! Where's the meteor? Hey, come here, it's just over there. But first. First, the first part of this game... Is I get to tie up your hands. - And my legs! - That's right. Okay, so you wrap that around your legs. Here, wrap this around your hands. Let's wrap this around your hands. Oh, wrap me around like Houdini. Here, here, here. First, first, wrap my hands, and then wrap my legs, and then wrap my mouth so I can't talk. That's a good idea. Just tie my hands. I am. Only tie my hands. Got it? Carl? Adam? Carl? - Are we getting close? - This is it, this is it. It was right around here. No, just get me up right now! Get me up right now, get me, seriously, get me up! - Come here. - Uh oh! We're almost done, we're almost done. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Did you hear that? Yeah. Untie me! - Carl! - Straight ahead! - Straight ahead. - Carl! Let go, let go, let go, let go! Come on, I'm just gonna tie your legs. Let go, let go! We're just gonna tie your legs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please, Carl, just hold still. No, no, no, no! - Just hold... - No, no, no, no! Carl? Carl? Adam, what the hell? What the fuck is going on here? Mom, let go. Let go. Let go. - Let go. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Let go, let go, let go! What the fuck?! Let go, let go, let go! Let go, let go. Shh, are you okay? I'm okay! Let go, let go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Zooey, I'm so sorry. I couldn't stop them! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What? I couldn't stop them. That's our son. I couldn't, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I couldn't stop them. I couldn't stop them, Zooey. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, it's my fault! I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I couldn't stop them! I ruined everything, I ruined it all!
