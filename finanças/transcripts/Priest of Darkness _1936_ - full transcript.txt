Synch, heavy check: Dan When a toad watches himself in the surrounded mirrors, he might be surprised and could become sweat gradually. Then, we collect it to the pan that had prepared, and mixed it with 108 kinds of herbs and a leaf of bamboo, and boiled over a slow fire. This is how to make this oil. Hello, sir. Thank you for coming. Is it selling? Children, children away! Away! How about it? Sir, thank you for coming. - Sells well? - No. As it's cold, only a few comes. Well, work hard anyway. Thank you. Well, I will draw out this long one. Sir, it's so cold tonight, I've got few customers. - Please, forgive me. - Idiot! If the master knew it! However, there are too many stores. No one knows if one or two is missing. The master always checks as he's stingy. Don't be so fussy. In any case, you could not earn any coins from it. No. No! Hello O-nami-san. Good evening. How about it? Is it selling today? As it's cold, I suppose it doesn't. Yes, it is. No, never mind. Never mind. You don't have to pay. As there are too many stores. No one knows if one or two is missing. However, I bothered you every time. No, it's nothing. Anyway, I could not earn any coins from it. Mr. Kaneko? Hello, Mr. Kitamura. Well, we've met at an unexpected place. It's good you look fine. Are you in service at Edo? - I've been here since last month. - Really? I'll go around until it becomes so late. Then good-night, O-nami. Mr. Kaneko! Between us, don't treat me so coldly! We've not met for so long, aren't we? Let's go talk somewhere while drinking! - Sorry, I'm little busy today. - Mr. Kaneko! Don't feel sorry for yourself even if you became masterless. We've not met for so long. How were you? We often rumoured on you, the way you lived. I live anyway. Don't be worry. Goodbye. Sister! Hiro-chan, where have you been in such late hours? Sister! Please, don't call me Hiro-chan. Why? What's wrong with "Hiro-chan"? I'm no more a child. So? Hirotaro, it's too late now. You'd better come home. Well, he looks strange! He wasn't such a man before. When a man becomes a masterless, he changes, I guess. Sister, I won't be back tonight, too! - Hiro-chan, where are you going? - Well, Madame, how much? Thank you. My small knife has gone! What's the matter with you? Well, I lost my small knife. It's a trouble. My small knife has gone. Again, you won. I can't match with you. You play chess as if you were a professional! I've lost three times in succession. I won't lost next. Well, mister, it's not interesting to bid 10-20 coins. Please, bid more. I have prepared 50 ryos. I accept any price not more than 10 ryos. Well, mister. Please, bid. - Well, I'll bid one ryo. - One ryo! Well, please bid. If you win, it will be five ryos back to you. You'd better stop it. Hiro-ko! Shut down. If you complain, go away now. Mister, please, do a bid. You've done a regrettable thing. Well, I've got one ryo. Then, please bid two ryos in avenge. Don't do it. Don't you understand? Master, please, don't care about those young guys, instead bid two ryos, don't you? No, I'll bid ten ryos. Ten? Yes, instead, if I win, I'll get 50 ryos. Exactly. If you bid ten ryos and you win, I'll back 50 ryos to you. Well, will you bid ten ryo? Folks, you see it, aren't you? It's a will of Edo habitants. In one night, 1000 ryos! This is the will that one doesn't keep the earnings overnight. You all! You ought to take a lesson from him. Well, I ask you again. If I win, this ten ryos will be back to me as 50 ryos? Yes. OK, boy. Go on. Well, I was deceived by that man. I have no words when deceivers are deceived. I'm sorry. The 50 ryos I borrowed from you and my saving 2 ryos Idiot! Go backyard and pour water in the well over yourself. Stop clowning. Thank you, Sir. It seems one is missing, isn't it? Sir, tonight, there were 43 stores weren't they? 42. I'm sure, 42. No mistakes. What's the matter, Miss? Well, there's a man upstairs, isn't it? I'll call him. What's his name? Well, is Hiro-chan there? - Who is Hiro-chan? - His name is Hirotaro. I've never heard of him. He should come here every day. OK, I will ask it. Wait. Who is it? - Me. - So it's you. Hello. Well... If he is, tell him to come home soon as his sister comes here. Is he your brother? So. What's the matter? - Is it open, upstairs? - Also today, all over night. - Is a man named Hiro-chan there? - Who's Hiro-chan? He's the brother of this girl. She comes to bring him back. Well. Go upstairs and ask it by yourself. Never mind. I will go and ask it. Is a Hiro-chan here? His sister's come here. - Who is Hiro-chan? - Today Hiro-chan is not here. Well, I will tell her so. Tonight, he's not here yet. Isn't he at Torako's place? Torako's. The notions shop. You don't know it? Are there any other places like this around here? Yes, of course. I'll tell you. Ken-san, who's that man? You don't know him? It's the husband of madame downstairs. - Then, you mean... - That man is Kochiyama Soshun. Saito's employee's house. And the back at that notions shop. Those are the gambling places around here I can recall. Thank you for your kindness. - Do you know the way? - Yes, I know it well. Cute girl. Are you already going back? Master, I'm sorry for the fuss last time. Isn't it you who taught me something kindly? I've heard of your name since long ago. However as I don't know your face... I was ashamed. You are not ashamed. I'd like to thank you. - You are joking! - Well, come in. What's your name? I'm sorry to forget it. I'm Hirotaro, no... Naojiro. Nice to meet you. Nao-san, let's have a drink. Don't do it. It's wrong let drink a young man with such a large cup. No problem for one cup. - No, don't you? - It's alright. - Mr. Nao, you're a drinker! - Yes, I can drink one or two shos. That's good. Amazing. You don't seem to be so. O-shizu, no more left. Bring us a good one. - I'm afraid I have it. - If you don't have it, awake the liquor shop owner and fetch it. But I haven't paid him for two months. You are unreliable. Keep always 10 or 20 barrels of it. That's your business, eh? Luxurious. O-shizu, is there something you want to buy? Don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd buy anything. Well, I've been longing for another jacket. OK, I'll buy it. Anything else? The cupboard in the backroom is indeed a borrowed one from a dealer. Borrowed? What a stingy! Buy it. We are short of hands. - I'd like to employ a girl. - OK, I'll buy it, buy it. - Madame. - What? I'm sorry to have said it. Ken-san, you've lost again, aren't you? Yes, I've lost completely. Then, I'd like to ask for a loan of one or so. OK. I will buy it. Keep it. Really? How kind! I'm sorry, Master. Madame, thank you. Darling, the belt you bought me last year. Belt? I'll buy it! Tonight, I'll buy anything. Nao-san, let's go to Yoshiwara to buy a courtesan. Wouldn't it be cool? I guess so. O-shizu, go and say to bring us two cabs. - You'd better not to buy a cab. - What? It's not necessary to buy it. You can ride on it, understand? Well. Nao-san, drink. It's poisonous to let him drink so much. I'll drink it, alright? Stop it. But, for such a child... Child? Ma'am, he's a great drinker! - Is he so strong? - Yes, how strong he is. Nao-san, it's tiresome. Let's drink with it. Serve him. Oh, is it all right? He can drink one or two shos, contrary to his appearances. It's true. A good drinker! Master. Nao-san, a guy like you should have some regular girls. I don't believe it. No, it's Nao-san. He should have it. - I have no regular girl. - Nao-san, don't hide it. It's true, I have no acquaintances. Is it first time you come to such a place? Nao-san, where are you going? Master, I'm not drunk yet. Are you Hiro-chan, aren't you? You are Hiro-chan. O-mitchan. Yes, I'm Omitsu. You have grown up. I hardly recognized you. He's really amazing. - Is O-nami-san well? - My sister? She is as always. Nao-san, despite you've said you have no regular girls, she's somewhat branded. - She's not! - No, we are friends from childhood. By the way, I've heard the master take a courtesan out. It costs plenty of money to take a courtesan out. Well, about 500 ryos. What? I can't imagine that stingy fellow have decided to pay such a price. Hello. Ushi. I think that the day I said to you to fix this break was yesterday morning. No, it wasn't yesterday. - What? - It was the day before yesterday. Idiot! Why haven't you done it? You have no glues? Yes, we've no glues, it's tiresome to go and buy it. I'll go and buy glues. Master? So. Is O-nami-san there? Mr. Kitamura. What's the matter? Sorry for last night. I visit here as I have something to talk with the girl. - Then, what's the talk? - Well, I have a trouble. Is there something about O-nami-san? Where is she? Nothing. She has just left to seek his brother. Mr. Kitamura, what's the business? As a matter of fact, it's a big deal. I think you know this sword of mine. Well, it is well made. Is it made from bamboo? No, far from it. It is a treasure of Kitamura's. It's a Muramasa, that was given from the previous lord. However, I've the small knife stolen last night. It's true. The small knife's missing. Who stole it? The guy's the brother of the girl of this house. Hiro-ko? He must have done it. No, the problem is if this matter will happen to be heard by my lord, I have to do harakiri. Will you cut your belly? It's a trouble. - Then, I'm in troubles. - You are! By the way, Mr. Kitamura, how old are you? Age? I'll be 53 this year. 53? One says life is 50 years. So a man who lives till 53, would be good enough. You! This is the next one. Then, here's a small knife which ornamented with gold and silver. As it's a holding of samurai, it's different from those of farmers or merchants. If times had not changed, these things are usually not for sale in such a market. In such a time like now, this small knife have to be sold. Check it by yourself. Look it carefully. You! It would be worth three ryos at least! It looks not so good. Well then, for the small knife that you've just checked, what price do you bid? Bid for it? How much? - One ryo. - Well! One ryo, one ryo. Well! Two ryos... Two ryos and two. Well! Two ryos and two... Three ryos! Five ryos, five ryos. Seven ryos! Seven ryos and two! 10 ryos. 11 ryos. It's late. Where did he go to buy glues? Hiro-ko. Brother, morning. - Hiro-ko, wait! - I'm in a hurry. It's the matter that you spoiled my business last day. We'll talk it later. Wait. You must be an accomplice with that monk. I don't know. Say. - Who on the earth is that monk? - I don't know! Say, who's that monk? Well, you have a bad brother, aren't you? I have no words for the samurai. That's why I'm in trouble. I guess so. If your brother happens to come here tonight, I will be sending him back. I ask you of it. Hirotaro? Yes, sorry for disturbing you. When my brother comes, I'll fetch him. - Kenta, please. - Understand. The man of last night. Don't you really know a guy named Hiro-chan? I don't know such a guy. The girl said that every night he comes here. I think you must know him. - I suppose Nao-san knows him. - What's the talking? Well, that guy whom the girl is searching named Hirotaro. Amazing. Why you so care for that guy? That girl is pitiful. Brother, I'm back. Nao-san is back. Nao-san, where have you been? I'd like to ask you. Do you know a guy named Hiro-chan or Hirotaro? Do you know him? Not well. As I'm not well acquainted with him. Can you find where he is? I can't imagine. What's the matter with him? Well, his sister came here anxiously. What's the matter with him? Excuse me, I'd like to ask you! The young guy that has just come here... You come from the chess house! Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I didn't know here's your house. Play one game. O-shizu, bring me a chessboard. You can't be kidding. I'm in a hurry, - I'd like to refuse it. - Wait. I suppose you should know a guy named Hiro-chan. What? Named Hirotaro. You know him? - Master, don't be kidding me. - Kidding what? By no means I don't know a guy named Hirotaro. Hiro-ko? What are you doing? Brother, I'm not Hiro-ko. My name is Naojiro. Keep it in mind. It won't become your benefit, if you hide him. - However, we can't find him. - That's not answering my question. I cannot report such an excuse to my load. So, I have to bring an action against the judge of Minamimachi to arrest the brother of this girl. Kitamura-san, I think you'd better not to rush. I hope he will be back tonight or so. We'll wait a few days and if he won't appear, then I suggest you to bring an action, or to do harakiri. All right. I'll wait a few days as it is Mr. Kaneko's word. You can wait? Kitamura-san, you are as expected. Thank you. I'm sure you'll find your small knife. If the small knife won't be retuned to me in three days, I will bring an action against the judge, Mr. Kaneko. Who is the current judge of Minamimachi? I guess Mr Kato is. Do you know him? I've met him few times. What's his first name? - Kiyomasa, I think. - That's right. Kiyomasa Kat... Anyway, if the small knife doesn't appear in three days, officers will come to invest you. You have to prepare. Goodbye, Mr. Kaneko. If this matter becomes known to the public, his life will be dangerous. He hardly bring it to the judge. Master, what's wrong? Ushi! I remember. I came here to buy glues. O-nami-san, take me some glues. Master, and the samurai who was here? No, nothing. O-nami-san, what's happened? Who on earth would pay ten ryos for such trivial small knife? It'd be a waste of money. You were wrong because you bid. Bid? The first price I bid was one ryo. Such ones worth one ryo! No one but fools can pay 10 ryos. Before I bought it at 10 ryos, you had said 7 ryos and 2. It's because you said 7 ryos before. As you said 5 ryos, I said 7. What did you say before that? You should have said three ryos! When I tried to buy it at 2 ryos, you should have been silent and quiet. It's your fault as you said 2 ryos and 2. What? Firstly, this is what I did. What? Hey, you both! Why you've got a quarrel? Yes, indeed, that's the small knife I had bought... - The small knife? - Yes! I'm searching for a small knife, too. You also, Excellency? Then, how about this one. Today I bought it from a friend for 20 ryos. What? 20 ryos? It's a great dig-out. For you, the Excellency, I don't mind, I could sell it for 20 ryos. No, what I'm looking for is not such a cheap... Any problems? I see. Do you like it? This is a great one even though it is a fake. It looks as if it were genuine. Where did you get it? Well, that... To tell you the truth, it's very important for a friend of mine as he regarded it as his family treasure. Although it is a fake, it is well made. I could find it as a fake, other ones could not. Yes, you have very good eyes, Excellency. - How much do you say? - 20 ryos, sir. All right. I will buy it for 30. - 30 ryos? - Exactly. I will buy it at 30 ryos. However, you must not tell anyone that this is a fake. Yes, I promise. Give me ten ryos! No, no problem. You don't need to pay! In any way, I could not earn any coins from it. Ushi, don't tell it to my boss. Thank you. O-nami, goodbye. O-nami-san, who's that samurai who came today? Nothing. I hear he said he'd bring something to the judge. I guess Hiro-ko must have done something again. He is a troublemaker. Ushi-san, I'd like to ask you a favour. What is it? Hiro-chan doesn't come home recently. Really? Today I met Hiro-ko in the daytime. I guess, since he hasn't returned home, he could be at that monk's place. Monk? Hiro-ko has recently become an accomplice with that dubious monk. O-nami-san, that's him. What? He has accompanied with that monk. Ah, you opened a store in such a place. Then I'd like to have a cup of sweet liquor. Chessman, won't you open your store tonight? Master, please, don't be kidding me. O-nami, I payed it here. Master, goodbye. It doesn't look easy, as alone. Hiro-chan was a very good boy in his childhood. Well, so, hasn't he returned yet? It's a trouble. Why can't he live honestly? When he returns, you'd better scold him. I guess his friend might be bad. Exactly, I've heard your brother comes every night to my upstairs; it's a bad thing. As it sounds unreasonable if I said this, but there's no place that honest men come. I beg you, could you please bring Hiro-chan back to me? He's good natured and shy. He doesn't seem to become your colleague. You're right. He's your brother. He must be far from the kind of us. Bring back Hiro-chan to me? I beg you, he is my only brother. You're odd. You talk as if I kept your brother at mine. Master! Don't count such a child. What? Ushi, is this? Hey, it's you who chiselled 50 ryos out of this man. So what? You have a nerve. Come with us. Miss, I'm worried about you, however, I and this samurai have to talk about something. We will talk you later. Hey you, where are we going? No, O-nami, don't come. I'll back soon. OK. Here we begin. Hey, keep it. Don't worry. Your leg looks to be short. Idiot! It's my other leg that's just long! I think it's immature to fight against a man with bad legs. Instead, I've good arms. Don't worry. Here I come. Master, you don't have to do so! Don't worry. Don't come here, it's dangerous. Step aside, it's dangerous. Here I come! O-nami-san, what's wrong? You cut your hand. It's bad. - We'll stop fighting. - Anyone has salve? Ushi, bring some salve. Fetch a toad oil. Master, it's nonsense! Idiot! Why don't you sell salves? Anyway, go and buy it. Quick to go. You've become good friends, aren't you? Well, Ushi and the other Morita-ya clans are not in good reputation, so we don't care to rob their money. You're employed at Morita-ya? Yes, as I have to do nothing else. So, your ability could, My ability? Do you know my ability? I was little surprised when I saw you draw the long one out smoothly. I agree. I'm also surprised. Since I bought this sword two months ago, it was the first time I draw it out. I'm very surprised this sword could be drawn out. Amazing bodyguard. O-nami-san, one more cup. Miss, tell me what you were talking about before. Am I doing something to your brother? Ushi-san told me. In these days, Hiro-chan is always with you. The guy with me is named Nao... Nao looks surely strange. I've never noticed that Master Kochiyama likes sweet liquor. Does my husband drink sweet liquor? You see. You look you know everything, but indeed you know nothing. It's always the same thing. What do you say? I mean sweet liquor is just sweet. Madam, don't be so upset. Ken-san, you shouldn't make fool of me. I think I'm very kind with you. You should talk it more frankly. As your attitude prevent me from talking, well, you remember that girl who was seeking a guy named Hiro? That's the girl of sweet liquor shop. Don't tell this to the master, please. It's the secret of secrets. Nao, the master's favourite, is... really the brother of that girl, and his name is Hirotaro. Don't worry. If you ask Master Kochiyama, he hardly refuses. Wait a minute. Ken-san, good evening. Is Master here? - He's absent. - Ma'am! Madam, I'll come again. Excuse me, take me in tonight, please? - I'm sorry for disturbing you. - I'd like to refuse. - What? - I refuse. Is Hirotaro your real name, isn't it? Madam, sorry. Madam, but since I came here depending on you, please, keep me here only for tonight. I'm sorry. It's not supposed to be happening. Don't mind. It's rather better because I could give it up. If Master Kochiyama was there! Since I can't get away with this, what should we do, O-mitchan? Hiro-chan, I'm ready for it. What? Ready? O-mitchan, are you willing to die? Yes. If I live long, I have no hope anyway. Well, I will die, too. Hiro-chan, what do you say? Well, don't mind. If I live long, I will be useless. O-mitchan, let's die together, shall we? No, you are not. I would have no words for O-nami, if I kill you. Don't mind my sister. I'm home. Ittsan, please, don't hesitate. Come in. It's not a cosy place, please, bear for it. Let's have a drink. O-fumi-chan, bring us something. This is a man who I've just known at that night pub. - Sit down, please. - Thank you. Hasn't Nao come back yet? I'd like to talk with him. To Nao-san, naturally you would. You, come here and greet him. You're strange. Wait for a moment. Quick, go and greet. Quick. Nao-san is really Hirotaro, isn't he? How do you know it? That's none of your business. I have never noticed that you liked sweet liquor. What's the matter with sweet liquor? Don't play innocent. I don't mind if you like sweet liquor. I suppose someone told you bad rumours. I'm discontented. Nao's sister, the girl who came here the last day. Such a child! What do you say! You've been talking with such a thought! Sorry Ittsan, we'd better go. Madam seems to be in bad temper. I am also... What do you say, Ittsan? I'm sorry for you, but we'll go drinking to some other place. Where are you going? Quiet! I, Kochiyama, serves nobody but the shogun. You're the one who came the other day. Come in. I'm sorry I disturb you every time. No problem, what's the matter? Well, is Mr. Kochiyama there? You need to talk with my husband, aren't you? I always appreciate you. I was asked to come here for my brother Hirotaro, this morning. We call him Nao-san. Younger ones in these days are really shameless. Last night he came, but... Did Hiro-chan come? He came with a young girl asking me to stay. Unfortunately, my husband is absent. - Then, where has Hiro-chan gone to? - I don't know at all. My husband hasn't returned since yesterday. Is Mr. Kochiyama absent? I guess he's at your place. Ken-san, the modern girls look as if they can't even kill an insect, we couldn't ignore them. It's true. A girl who looks at first like a child, leads a man by the nose. Women are monstrous. And she even comes to me for making fun of us. I'm scared. You are silent as you are good natured. As I'm a woman though, I feel not so good for that. Madame, you're an expert. What? If you are too intimate to that girl, you'll be scolded by my husband, too. I see. Toji-san, you are too snappy today. Snappy? Since this morning, I'm rather shrinking, because I saw a 'good' omen. What's happened? It's more than just happened. A corpse of a courtesan. A corpse of a courtesan? A corpse of a courtesan. Well then, for a corpse of a courtesan. I'm sorry for saying it before you, old folk, she was amazingly beautiful. When I took her in my arms, I trembled myself. It's a double suicide. For the rest part of the double suicide! Hiro-chan, when you came back? Where have you been? I was desperately seeking for you. Hiro-chan, please, think of me a little. What's the trouble? You are wet. Boss, here it is. O-nami-san. Is she absent? Boss, what should we do? Ushimatsu? O-nami-san, is Hiroko home? - No. - I guess he surely is! No. Has Hirotaro done something wrong? It's not a trifle. Hiro-ko did an audacious thing. Hiro has returned home, hasn't he? If you lie, there'll be troubles. No, my brother hasn't retuned home for days. What Hirotaro did? He's escaped with a girl named Mitsutose I had taken. If I leave Hiro enough alone, my face will be lost. O-nami, you can also make a living under the favour of my Boss. Forget that and returning evil for good. Hiro, when found, would lose his hand or a leg. Sort of a slap on the wrist. Ushi, stop it. Nothing will change, if you threaten the girl. Miss, is it true that Hiro hasn't returned? Yes, Mister. When my brother come back, I'll let him apologize with you. You think the term as "apologize" or "forgiveness", but it will cost 300 ryos for Mitsutose. 300 ryos? Can you prepare them? You say nothing, aren't you? I guess she could prepare them. Well, you are right. O-nami-san, 300 ryos is a big sum. You'd better to consult with yourself. If you can't prepare it, come at my Boss' place. He's so merciful. Goodbye. Miss, give me a balloon. That one, Miss. Hi-Bo, a balloon will be yours. Here, Hi-bo. Sister, what's the matter? Are you angry? What have you done! Sister. We have no way to settle this bad business. Again bad news? My desire has never been fulfilled in these days. Infinitely bad. He hasn't returned yet... Where is he wandering? I knew you were worried about him. He might be lying about, as it snows. Kenta-san, stop it. Who knows the other's feeling? So I suppose I'm not bad. - Kenta-san. - What, Fumi-chan? Someone is coming to you. Who? Man or woman? A woman. Madame, what's the business? Madame, you'd be amazed, if you knew who is here? I see. You have eaten too much. Yes, I have. I've also drunk much. It's longer than daemon's loincloth. I'm really amazed that we've never served more than that to you, since we started our store. It's inexpensive. 12 ryos and 2. Exactly. Thank you very much. However I have no money. Make it a charge on me. Are you kidding? No, I'm serious. That would annoy me rather. Then, come to my house together. Ittsan, go quick. Ittsan. Let's have a drink somewhere else. - I agree. - You're surely joking, mister. Don't worry. You come and drink together somewhere. No, wait. Since I never pay, even if I drink so much, it's the same thing where I drink. However, I'm worried about my job, if I was away from Morita-ya so long. Then, I will go back now. Let's drink some time. Goodbye. As my wife is in bad temper, I am not responsible if she pays or not. What? Mister. I will go. Madam, thank you very much for the money I borrowed last time. You are enjoying a boom, Ken-san. Don't treat me so cheap. Sometime wind blows from north, sometime from south. - You sold that girl, haven't you? - I'll leave it to your imagination. Ah, I must bring money to Hiro. It's just as I thought. Madame, don't tell it to the Master. Needless to say it. Well, Madame, I'll come again. Madame, the Master is back. Welcome home, Master. Madame has been so anxious. Welcome home. I've been so worried. Is anyone here with you? It's just a horse who followed me. Horse? What does it means? A horse to collect a bill. Pay him. Sorry for troubling you, I'm sorry. Sorry for asking you. I'm sorry, you've come to such a place. Thank you. It's 12 ryos and 2. And this is a tip for you. Thank you very much. Goodbye. It seems my wife's temper has greatly changed. It may sounds like an arbitrary request, however, I'll be in trouble - if you have no care for that. - Well, I will care for it. In my house, we feed many people, however, no one eats idle bread. Well, idle bread. Well, is that so? I'd like to ask you to go on a message. When it'll be done, you have to return here as soon as possible. - I can wait for two or three days. - I see. And what's the message? - I'd ask you to go to O-nami's place. - It's about O-nami! It's a pleasure to go to O-nami's place. The message is: "I came from Morita-ya. I'd like to have the 300 ryos you promised yesterday". What? Master, I'd ask you again, what you have said now? I asked you to fetch 300 ryos. You're looking me in odd way. All you have to do is to fetch money. Boss, I'd like to ask you a little question about the 300 ryos. How one could assemble 300 ryos? Since O-nami-san sells sweet liquors at 3 or 5 coins, it's impossible she has that much. Even if it's your order, it'd be totally vain for me to go fetch it. - Don't you remember me? - Who are you? Return the small knife! My life might depends on that. Boy, return it! You're still saying such trivial things. I might become angry, but I will not. Please, give it back to me. I will thank you. Please. It's funny to keep such trivial one so long. Mr. Kitamura! - Mr. Kaneko. - What's the trouble? Big beyond all sense! He's an 'enfant terrible'. It's a guilty that one can't know the value of it. This small knife is a gift from my load. Even so, it's highly possible he could want it back. Well, every lord is like a child. When he's in good temper, he's pleased to give something; if he's in bad temper, he'll request to return what I gave. Exactly. Then, when will you do harakiri? No, Mr. Kaneko. You are a friend of mine. Please, persuade the boy. Hiro-ko. I'm not that kind of persuader, however I think stealing isn't a good deed. To rob the small knife is bad thing. - So, give him it back. - I haven't got such a thing. - What you have done of it? - I have sold it on bid market. Oh, you've sold it. Then there's nothing I can do. Kitamura-san, it's time to... Well! It'll be a secret among us that... I found a substitute for it. Substitute? It's of course a fake. However, only an expert can find it out. Well, you've found a useful one. Yeah, but it's not more than the genuine one. But I could avoid harakiri with it. Goodbye. The Boss at Morita-ya ordered me to get 300 ryos. Haven't you heard something from your sister? Is that so? That's all finished. Finished? Why will you give 300 ryos to Morita-ya? You should have some reason. Why are you quiet? What's happened to O-nami? Where is your sister? Hiro-ko! Look straight at my face. Are you so rotten that you can't say it clearly? I'm sorry, Master. Last night, my sister sold herself because of me. Sold herself? Where did she go? Don't know the detail. I've heard she went to somewhere around Inari-Yokocho. It's the neighbourhood of Kochiyama's place. - Is it safe? - What's are you talking about? I'm talking about Mr. Kaneko. These days, he's a little strange. He begins to think of love. If such guys go wrong, he'll be beyond our control. He left here before noon. Now it's about sunset. Well, even though he's a limp, he's little too late. That's as I expected. He seemed to be strange when he left us. He might be escaped with money. Are you surely going to Koga? Yes, of course. In such mountains, we have to be alone. You don't need to confirm. Having escaped around Shimofusa, I, Kochiyama, will run out of luck. Are you there? Oh, you're here. Ittsan, what's the matter? Good timing. Ittsan, how could you avoid losing your job? I could avoid losing my job, however... What's wrong? O-nami san has gone. What happened to her? - She has sold herself, I hear. - Sell herself? Why? Later. Before that, go to the place where she sold herself, is just nearby. It's Inari-Yokocho. Do you have some places in mind? Around Inari-Yokocho? Wait. Who's a guy who would do such businesses around here? Ittsan, I see. Kenta, at the house opposite. He's as if a servant of hoons. Let's go together. O-nami-san. Come in, O-nami-san. What's wrong, O-nami? Anyway, we'll go upstairs to talk about details. Then, go upstairs. Don't hesitate. O-shizu, today I forbid you to let anyone go upstairs. Your sister is good natured, isn't she? Well, here's 100 ryos. Take it. 100 ryos? In this paper, it's written 300 ryos. It's only on the paper. But... You are not sensible. Since you don't know the world, you say such things. It'll be all settled, if you receive it with your thanks. I'm not so foolish. I refuse it. Anyway, we'll talk about it later. Write your name here. I ask it. Here's Hiro. Hiro, you can't escape from me with any effort. How dare you to kill Mitsutose? I have not regrets about the dead girl. As I talked it to O-nami, I'll request you 300 ryos, in a lump sum. Hey, Kenta. I'll ask you to pass 300 ryos to the boss. What are you saying? It's enough to be 100 ryos. Here's Kenta. Why are you here? Yes, boss of the Morita-ya. Kenta. You've showed me a receipt for 300 ryos. Don't fool me so much. Hey, boss at Morita-ya, look at this. Has O-nami sold herself? Who told her to do so? She did it because you annoyed my sister. Anyway, you could receive the amount of 300 ryos from this guy. - Hiro. Wait a moment! - Kenta. Don't kid with me. It's not surprising. I couldn't bear it, if you did as you like. Then, where is O-nami? Well, she's still at my house. She worths 500 or 600, if we take her to Yoshiwara. You, go and fetch O-nami to my house. Yes, I will go. Come on, Kenta. You are terribly coward. It needs just 300 ryos to save her from selling herself OK. I will manage to prepare those 300 ryos. Don't worry. To prepare that sum, I will cooperate with you. Do you have any idea? For now, I have no special idea. Well, indeed, I have a plan to get 300 or 500. You have? Yes, it's not so surprising. listen to me... Kenta. Where is O-nami-san? O-nami has gone. Hey, have you seen someone coming to my house? It's a young girl. Don't you see her? Let me alone. Where you send her to? Where you hide the girl? It's not a joke. She has escaped. She can't escape. Please, release me. You must be acting. It's true. I'll ask her of to another. O-fumi-chan, don't you know? Has anyone come from my house? Madame, didn't you see a girl named O-nami? She's not at my house. - I don't know. What's the problem? - She must have been escaped! You look flustered! It's nothing. What's the business you come here? No, well, I'll come later. Where you hide the girl? I feel really stuck. There she is. Gee, you! Don't try to escape. Well, I will prepare for that. I ask you. Wait. O-shizu, how much do you have here? How much? It's enough for 10 ryos. But, we'll need money for travelling. I know it. By tomorrow, I will have the money. Use it for your preparation. Ittsan, are you ready? In any case, it's a matter of life and death. I think I could be a human by doing so. So far I've eaten idle bread only, but, in this case, I am not. The man who can die gladly for another person can be called a man. O-shizu, we'll be leaving tomorrow night. You also have to prepare. - Anything wrong? - Not at all. I can stay in Edo only today and tomorrow. Then, for farewell, I'll go shaving. It might not been possible for me to come home until tomorrow. I'll leave the girl upstairs to you. You see, tomorrow, I'll go travelling with you alone. Has O-nami escaped? Yes, as no one knows where she is, Kenta looks so confused. Idiot! Stop it! You talked as if it concerns only others. Don't you think of me, who's just hearing? If she has escaped, it'll be a total loss for me. Yes, it's true. Boss, I will go searching. Naturally. Take O-nami back within tomorrow morning. You all. Go with Ushi and split up to search for her. You all, help me. Oh, you are Hiro. I don't tolerate you do such things. Where is my sister? Please, get her back to me. Get O-nami back to you? I'd rather ask to you where she is. Even you don't know where she is. Please, don't say such wild guess. Give my sister back to me. You're annoying me! Ushi, anyone there? What are you doing? I'd like to complain. At first, I can't save my face. Fumi-chan, go ahead. I will follow you soon. I'm going now. Madam, listen to me, from Sagami-ya at Shinagawa I will receive 300 ryos for a good 'jewel' with the promise to send it tonight. However, in this situation, I dare to say before you, where on the earth could I stand? As if I set a fox free in the field, I can't find even her shadow, I'm in tears though. Good evening. Roku-san, I'm sorry. Tonight we are closed. It's regrettable. Then I go upstairs. No, you can't. No one is allowed to go upstairs. It's an order from the master. Is that true? Well, It looks too strict. Madam, are there any special things upstairs? Madam, in upstairs room, it happens to be... Since I'll be out for a while for bathing, please stay here. Since my man said so, it's forbidden to let someone go upstairs. All right? You are not allowed to go upstairs. Sir Dokai, thank you so much for coming as a messenger from the Royal Highness. Please, let me know what's the business to my Lord Izumo. The message from the Royal Highness is nothing but... all of a sudden, I'd like to see the small knife of Lord Izumo. What? It is the small knife, the small knife. Exactly. No, what I'm humbly asking to see isn't such a small knife. It's your family treasure, the small knife made by Goto Yujo. Once, former lord of your family received it from shogun family. I must see that small knife at all costs. Frankly to say, the other day, the Royal Highness, in Ueno, bought a small knife at some place. It's also a masterpiece of Goto Yujo. It happened to be seen by the shogun himself, and he said that it looked like the small knife I gave to Lord Izumo in the former days. However, that small knife is the masterpiece, which should be one and only. Then you're saying there are two one-and-only small knives. It seems mysterious. I dare to say it, but I suppose the small knife which the Royal Highness bought in Ueno is a fake. You are right, if the small knife does exists in this family. What do you say? You say that I, Lord Izumo, have lost the small knife? Or are you about to say that you have lost it? No. Since it's a very special knife, I received it from the shogun himself. It's hardly possible that I might lost it. However, it's hardly possible that the one and only small knife would appear in two. Do you know that we have the knife that was given to my deceased father from the shogun family? Yes, we have it. It's a masterpiece of Goto Yujo. - I know it. - Where is it? Bring it to me. Well, I'm sure the former Lord sent it to Daizen Kitamura. Call Daizen here. You haven't told to anyone this small knife is a fake, haven't you? No, I haven't. Don't tell to anyone. This is what my deceased father received from the shogun family, the masterpiece of Goto Yujo. The one and only small knife. Can you confirm it, Sir? - I'm sure it looks alike to it. - What? Lord Izumo, I don't know other people, however it's not so easy to deceive Dokai. What do you say? This small knife isn't a Goto Yujo's work. What's the evidence that makes you say so? This small knife is well made. Almost as alike as the genuine one. However, a fake's a fake. Lord Izumo, look at this point carefully. This point is the problem. If it were genuine... Sir, please! Wait a moment. Who is speaking? I'm Daizen Kitamura, chief retainer of this family. What is your business, Daizen? I beg to differ. That small knife is surely the one that was given to the former Lord from the shogun family. It cannot be a fake one. What do you say? Exactly. It isn't a fake one. Daizen knows it. Daizen, then this small knife... Idiot! Why didn't you say it earlier? Lord Izumo, if the shogun knew that you lose that small knife, you wouldn't be forgiven. I'll report to Royal Highness in Ueno as soon as I return. No. I had thought so, but, Daizen Kitamura interrupted me. Please, send the best regards to the Royal Highness in Ueno. Lord Izumo, this small knife is surely the one you received from the shogun himself. It's really the one-and-only masterpiece of Goto Yujo. It's an admirable one. I'll tell so to the Royal Highness in Ueno. Thank you very much. Daizen, for that, I would like to have golden tea. Yes. Sorry, sorry. I'd like to speak. It's a serious affair. What's happened? Well, the guest who came before is a fake. - What do you say? - That's a fake. You rude! It's not a fake. It's really the one of Goto Yujo. Rude one, go away! - But it is that... - Go away! The small knife is really a piece of Goto Yujo. Yes, it is needless to say. No, it's a fake. That small knife... That man who came: that is a fake! That monk is a fake. Yes, that monk is a fake, an imposter. What, the monk is an imposter? What haven't you said it earlier? I have to report it to my Lord. You both, you both, which one is the fake? Tell it again clearly. The monk or the small knife? It is the monk. O-nami-san. We've prepared the money. What's the trouble? - The girl is not here. - Is not? O-shizu, we can't find the girl upstairs, what happened to her? Nao-san came and take her with him. Nao took her? It's not another person, it's Nao-san. So I think it should be alright. Where have they been? I have just dropped by his home in my return, it seems no one is there. I'd like to give the money sooner. And then, have you made money for taking that girl? I've got money, however, I'm now in danger. Officers visited here, just before. They've come so fast. Good evening. Please, open the door. Who are you? I'm a member of Morita-ya clan. Please, open this door. Good evening. Good evening. Is Hiro here? That's it. We're also searching for Hirotaro. - So, Hiro's not here? - What happened to him? Didn't you know it? He killed the Boss. - What? Morita-ya? - Master, I beg you! If Hiro happens to come here and you hide him, it'll be not good for you. I beg you. Men, let's go. I'll stay here to watch, you all, search the other places. - Did Nao say where he would have gone? - No, he said nothing. Itchan, did you hear it? Hiro! Master. Didn't you see my sister? Is my sister at your place? What? I have killed Morita-ya. So tell my sister that there are no worries. Thank you for your kindness. So long. Wait. I thought you had taken O-nami! What? I'm searching for her! Searching? O-shizu, you've done something? I don't know. - Where did you hide her? - I don't know. I'm not aware of. She went away while I was absent. Woman, don't you understand my feelings? Where did you hide O-nami? Tell me! Why have you fallen in love with such a child? What? O-shizu, open it! Who are you? I don't want you. Hiro should be here. Get away. No, I won't let you enter my house. Stubborn! Hiro, if you are a man, get out! Alright, I'm coming! I won't forgive you, if you hurt her even if at her finger. Let me go, Master! Idiot! You don't understand how I feel. If you die, what will happen to O-nami? Master Kochiyama, if you don't let Hiro out, sorry, she will lose her life. OK, I'll go out now. Please, don't stop me. I'm not a nobody. Don't stop me. If I let her killed now, I'll be no longer a man. Waht a laugh! You're still green, you've never been a man! You're the dishonour of ours. Go home and sip the sweet liquor at the fair. Open it, quick! Master Kochiyama, if you don't hurry, her life could be in danger. Don't care. Escape with Hiro! What will you do with her? Are you satisfied with that? Anyway, this is my job. Ittsan, this is not the matter. She's my wife. Kochiyama's wife. I will take it upon myself. Don't worry. Ittsan, escape, quick! I'll ask you to take care of him. Don't care. Let me take O-shizu with me, and escape from the back door. If you don't hurry, he'll be in danger. Well, go and escape! All right, I'll take Hirotaro on me. OK, I will open now. You've done it! Brace yourself. - Brace yourself, O-shizu. - O-nami-san... Where have you sent O-nami? O-nami-san is taken to Sagami-ya at Shinagawa. Kenta took her. To Sagamiya at Shinagawa? Hiro, escape quickly. I'll be waiting for Kochiyama, escape quickly. Send my best regards to O-nami. Escape quickly, quick! Kochiyama. - I've found where O-nami is. - Well, that's good. I'll take here. You, quick! It's about my time to retire. If a man missed an opportunity, his rest of life would be much shameful. I understand. - Escape quickly. - OK. I'll escape. Escape, quick. Quick! Master. Keep them in check here. Nao, go to Sagamiya at Shinagawa. Take it and go to O-nami-san's place! Go! Master! Go quick. Nao, quick!
