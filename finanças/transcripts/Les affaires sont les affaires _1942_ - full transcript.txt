BUSINESS IS BUSINESS Adapted from Octave Mirbeau's masterpiece Octave Mirbeau's masterpiece was presented for the first time at La Com?die Fran?aise on the 20th of April, 1903. Here's the precious handwritten manuscript of 'Business is Business' with its early title 'Vauperdu'. This manuscript belongs to Sacha Guity. It is thanks to his kindness that we can see Mirabeau on screen. He was kind enough to extract from his film 'Ceux de Chez Nous' this moving image, the only one existing of the famous author of 'Calvaire'. This shot was taken 25 years ago, a few weeks before the death of Octave Mirabeau. COCK'S CROW Sorry, senator, Mr. Isidore Lechat is in a meeting. Yes, sir? Mr. Lechat will see you tomorrow at 10am. You knew my situation, it was desperate. In exchange for the help I requested from you, you asked me to entrust to you all that remained of the shares in my bank. I brought them to you. - Even the ones that didn't belong to you. So what? As soon as it was known I was behind you, the storm has turned away. But, Lechat, since the opening of the stock market this morning, you've been selling my titles, you've dumped my shares on the market. So what? - It's a crime. No, it's my right. Come in! What is that? I bring you the corrected text. - I want to see that. Calm down and have a seat, I'll be with you in a moment. "It is certain that after the ordeals so painful, so unjust, that this little country has so valiantly overcome, "it can count on the active sympathy of all French people..." How much did we get for this? - 30. 30,000? And for this pitiful sum you give them some "active French sympathy" on the front page of my newspaper? Their Legation does not have very large credits. It's a very small country, isn't it? A small country that borrows big like all small countries. I thought that with famine threatening them... - It's not threatening you. You sure you haven't you perceived more than 30,000? Oh, boss, me? You know very well that... Oh, it's okay! "It is certain that after the ordeals so painful, "so unjust that this small country so valiantly overcome..." Well, that's already worth 25,000. "...it can count on the active sympathy..." "Sympathy", that's worth 25,000 more. "...active..." "active", "active", it's worth 75,000. "...of all French people", it's worth 100,000. That's settled, good evening. You know that you're ruining me. - I'm covering myself, that's all. You'll see, Lechat. If you don't stop this, there'll be panic. The prices will collapse. Ring them up. That's the way. Hello, call Miss please. Of course, at her apartment. Hello? Is that you, Maria? Is Miss there? Put her on. I'm begging you, Lechat, I'm on the chopping block. I have children, I have a wife. So do I, old bean. Actually I have several. - You'll drive me to suicide. What do I care? Business is business. Hello? Is that you, dear? Good morning. Sir! Sir! Hello? Yes, President sir? For dinner? Mr. Isidore Lechat definitely won't be able to. At this time of year, he returns every evening to Ch?teau de Vauperdu. Three sparrows, a titmouse and a robin, that makes three francs. Thanks, sir. Did Mr. Lechat get it into his head to destroy all the birds? You hear that, Lavigne? Mr. Lechat protects agriculture. Next spring, he will pay 5F for any nest with the eggs in it. If it's his idea, that's fine, but to destroy them all he would have to be the good Lord himself! What do you bring me, my good man? Ah, it's you, P?re Grain. Yes, steward, it's about my term. I know I'm two months late concerning the rent, but it's the first time and times are so hard... Oh, if my poor boy hadn't died last year... I know, I'll talk to Mr. Lechat. I'll ask for a delay. Thank you, steward. It?s not for lack of trying hard. I know. Germaine, why don't you talk to me? I've nothing to tell you. You've read enough. - I wasn't reading. You were day-dreaming? - No, I wasn't day-dreaming. Then what are you doing? - I'm bored. Listen to me, this will distract you. What time is it? 6pm, mummy. 6pm, already? What's this? A dispatch. Hand it over. It's from Nice, it's your brother. What are you hanging about for? Be off with you. "Coming for dinner tomorrow at Vauperdu. Xavier." He doesn't exactly overflow with emotion. Your father's late. What time is it? I just told you, mummy, 6pm. Oh yes. How time passes. With his mania of inviting anyone and everyone he's met... I wonder who he'll bring from Paris this time? The thing is... I have 2 chickens. If he doesn't bring anyone, what'll I do with my 2 chickens? We may be rich but I hate to waste. There's the poor. - The poor? I've never seen an area with so many poor. A rich man is always surrounded by poor folks. If they worked more, they'd be less poor. Worked at what? We've taken everything from them, their little field, their little garden, their little house, agglomerated into what father calls "his estate". That's enough. I don't want to argue with you. What were you saying? Nothing. Mr. Garraud. My husband hasn't arrived yet. - I thought I heard the car. You were wrong. I'm sorry, madam. Who has put all this nonsense into your head? Mr. Garraud, I presume. He has nothing to do with it. You're always together. The daughter of a man with an historic estate and an employee of her father, virtually a servant. A servant? He has a chemistry diploma. A chemist you say? I can't believe we built him an expensive laboratory. Chemist! When he came here, he didn't even have a shirt. Whatever. He was just out of ?cole Centrale. Out of Maison Centrale [prison] more like. Oh, dear mummy, you weren't so mean before. Go and fetch the wine. I told you I wouldn't go to the cellar anymore. You've a dozen servants. Yes, servants who rob me. Last Sunday yet, three bottles were missing from the middle pile. How do they do it? I have the key. How could it be otherwise in a house where one only hears about "tricking someone" ? Relax, they'll never steal as many bottles of wine as others have gained millions. Germaine. - I said "gained". Do you mean your father? Well, let's talk about it for once. I've had enough of my daughter's wicked ideas. Your father is vain, extravagant, deceitful, yes. He often reneges on his word, he loves deceiving people but only in business. He's still an honest man, do you hear? And even if he weren't, you have no right to judge him. - Who then? Know that he owes his fortune to no one, he gained it through hard work. Yes, he went bankrupt twice. But didn't he obtained a conciliation procedure from Justice? If he was in prison, wasn't he subsequently acquitted? But look at where he is now, proprietor of a great newspaper. He who barely knew how to write. Think about it. If he was a rogue, he wouldn't be friends with the minister. Of 2 ministers. - "Of 2 mi...? You're mocking me. Are you going to the cellar, yes or no? Mummy... - All right, I'll do it. It's unbelievable. How well dressed you are, my good Jules. Do you go to a wedding today? A wedding... If only, Miss Germaine... I was going to the ch?teau to say my farewells, because we're leaving. But don't you like it around here anymore? It's not that. Sir and I had words, we gave each other 8 days' notice. Oh, it can't be. We used to natter so often. Ms Germaine can be sure I always did my best for her. The small clematis garden... - It was so pretty. And the Japanese irises at the edge of the great pond. Another of Miss' ideas. And you thought I was gonna let you leave all this? As long as Ms Germaine has been happy, I can leave with a less heavy heart. I'll speak with my father tonight. Then Miss needs to know everything. With all respect, Miss knows my wife is expecting a baby. Indeed, so what? Sir doesn't want a child here. This morning he told me: "Upon reflection, "no children here. They spoil the lawns and mess up the driveways." But where will you go? Who knows? To find work at this time of year, with my wife the way she is, I'll have to go back to construction. Do you have some savings, at least? I have my arms. In that case, good Jules, all I can do is pity you and wish you all the best. If I dared, miss, I'd tell you... Tell me. Miss, you too, you're not happy here. Me? I'm very happy, on the contrary. Someone with a heart like yours can't be happy here. My friend, I'm warning you right now, don't you dare take an interest in the cigars. Here they are counted and twice rather than once. What a dump! That's an opinion... that I share. So you continue to twiddle your thumbs while I have to go get the wine in a dinner dress. Oh, these servants, what a mob! Give them a year in a place and they think they own it. I hope your father will bring all this little circle to their senses. Like that poor gardener... "Like that poor gardener"! You only have pity for the lazybones and the thieves. Not for everyone. How many diners for tonight? You have been here for three months and you're asking me that again? With sir's mania for bringing people back without warning... In case of emergency, I thought about a can of foie gras. It's ready right away. Are you mad? Why not some truffles too while you're at it? By the way, Mr. Garraud, it seems you're plotting with my husband giving him all sorts of strange ideas. As if he didn't have enough of his own... You very well know that is not true. You immediately assume I'm lying. Who else could it be? Isidore talks about nothing else than revolutionising agriculture. No more wheat, no more oats, no more beets. They're pass? it seems. What a crazy idea! I've warned him of the danger of these new ideas. Which will cost us tens, hundreds of thousands of francs. - I fear so. Well, thanks. What a lovely year you are preparing for us. Remember, madam, that last 14th July, when Mr. Lechat wanted to paint the trees in the avenue, some red, the rest in the tricolour. In the tricolour, indeed. You are not allowed a minute's respite when you're married to such a man. Outside of his business, he only has stupid things. But I thought you had a certain influence over him... I have none, Madame. Mr. Garraud is too poor. He has too many scruples. Your father. Hopefully he hasn't brought back fifteen guests. What time is it? Oh yes, I know. 45km, including getting out of Paris, in 33 minutes. Not bad, eh? What a handsome estate. 7000 hectares. All this is mine. There must be lots of game. - Lots. But apart from the partridges and pheasants there are no more birds. That's a shame. A shame? Those vandals eat everything. But I'm crafty. I'm having them all killed. 5 sous for a sparrow, 10 for a warbler, 2 francs a nightingale. We're killing the lot, soon none will be left. Hello, Moreau. Hello, friends. Take this and go and drink to my health. Thanks, Mr Lechat! Old man Lechat, he's a sociable type. Right, good, he's being cheered by the farm workers. Who has he brought back this time? You seem well appreciated. - They love me round here. It costs me enough, I'm too kind. See the ch?teau. It was built by Louis XIII. All the aristocrats paraded here dressed in silk and velvet. What good did that do? Who does it belong to today? To a proletarian. The people's revenge! Yes. Yes. Ah, here are the ladies. A pastoral scene. A real Watteau. Hello my little missus! Let me introduce you to my friends. Mr. Phinck. M. Phinck et Mr... Mr. Gru... Herbert Gruggh. I couldn't remember his name. - Gentlemen. True pals. They own a hydro-electric plant of 10000 horsepower. 20000. You hear that? 20000 horsepower. Oh, you chaps! My daughter, Ms Germaine Lechat, a good match. Hard headed but with a big heart, like her father. And an intellectual too. Oh no, please. - And modest with it. Final edition, Cock's Crow, special edition. There's that idiot, Dauphin, who's blown his head off, on the third page. The banker you were doing business with? A petty crook without ambition. Don't feel pity for lame ducks. Take this to the office. And make everyone read it! To own a newspaper, what a thrill! It must be enjoyable to run. It's not for the enjoyment, it's a lever. Suicide of banker Gabriel Dauphin From who? - From Xavier. Oh! Bravo! Let me introduce you to Xavier Isidore Lechat of Vauperdu, my son. A strapping fellow, and modern. He's launching the dynasty of Lechats of Vauperdu. You'll meet him tomorrow. The gentlemen are staying the night? Just for one night, not taking up residence. Do you know about my son? - No. That's strange, he's well known. Racing stables, yachts, hunting parties, the prettiest women in Paris... He gives us plenty of headaches, but he's his father's folly. Isidore gives him everything, and the lad takes advantage. He's having fun, the little rascal. It's his age. Shall we go in and show their rooms to your guests? Yes, come on, let's go in. Sorry I'm late, sir. You've turned up finally. Where were you when I arrived? - I was marking the oaks for the sale at La Fraudi?re. I want you at your post when I arrive, understood? This is the last time. Is it to be chic that you keep your hat on your head? Is it okay in your world if you talks to your boss with your hat on your head? That's better. May I present to you the Viscount de la Fontenelle, my steward. He had some misfortunes. Women, horses, baccarat and here is the result. Sir! - Don't be upset, old "Chouan". Put your hat back on your head. And your coronet with it if you haven't sold it. Come on, to my office! Excuse me, but it's time for my daily report. I can't miss it. See you shortly. So, what's today's news? Hippolyte Gouin, the Villeneuve farmer, is asking for two months' delay. Not one day, call the bailiff tomorrow. If I may say so, he's a good man down on his luck. What else? I couldn't settle things with the gardener. He doesn't accept that you're withholding his 8 days. Really? A fool who can't even grow peas, who thinks he can have children on my estate without consulting me, doesn't accept it? This is one for the Justice of the Peace. Next. Go quicker. The painter says it was you yourself... Does he have it in writing from me? No! He can get lost. Let him know that what I say is worthless. What I write is all that counts. Next? I delivered the feed as you instructed. And the alfalfa? - We've sown it skillfully with the maid. No poachers today? - No, sir. I heard that mother Motteau was surprised gathering dead wood. File a report. - You can't mean that, sir. It's traditional, to allow the collection of dead wood. The poor have the right... - The poor have no rights! Dead wood is just an excuse to set some snares and wreck my coppice. I'm a democrat, but I'm nobody's mug! The poor! Don't they get bread distributed every Saturday? Doesn't my wife strain her eyes knitting for their kids? The nerve of these people! The Marquis de Porcellet called earlier. Really? The Marquis deigned to come himself? It means he's broke. - He wants to see you. He insisted upon it. Phone him immediately, say I'll be receiving him tomorrow at 2pm. And you will have his file ready. This is going to be fun. Good evening, viscount, you can go. I forgot, I had a look at the cow. Ah, you should have started there! How's she doing? The vet says she can't be saved. Oh, that's terrible. Oh, that's terrible, that is. A cow worth 18000F. Your vet is a fool, he hasn't a clue. I'll go look for myself. I'm good with cows. It's a burden, this great lump of a place. What a chore with all the servants who only think of stealing from me! This came to us too late in life. Yet, madam, to have earned all this through work, by merit alone, it's extraordinary on the contrary. Yes, but it's better to be born into it. I always feel like I am on a trip, lodging at the hotel in a foreign country. It's like all these big portraits. I can't get used to their looks. They seem to say: "Who's that fat woman who's not from around here and whom we don't know?" Your happiness is making you unfair. My happiness... A small house, a small garden, that's all I needed. You'll have to forgive me, but there isn't much for dinner. My husband doesn't alert me when he's bringing people home. Can you believe it? They aren't "people", they're friends. We still need to have enough to feed them. They are not here to eat but to do business. May I go, sir? Ah, may I introduce my engineer, my personal engineer, Garraud with whom I'm conducting experiments on... Garraud? - Sorry, sir? What are they called, these experiments? Plant biology. - "Plant biology", excellent. And the fertilisers? - Nothing new. Well, crack on, I've announced our discovery to the whole world, the minister, the agricultural society, everyone. And I'm going to start a huge campaign in the Cock's Crow: "Isidore Lechat, journalist and farmer". It's a manifesto, that's what it is. Ah, say, I've had a look at the sick cow. Nothing a good bottle of rum won't cure. Don't you agree, Garraud? Mr Lechat's methods are highly idiosyncratic. - And very original. Rum for a cow? You want to kill her? Come on, you don't know anything about cattle. My father was a share cropper and my uncle a bonesetter. They even knew better than Garraud. Without wanting to upset you, my friend. Dinner is served, madam. You can go home now. - Thank you. We'll entertain you in the small dining room. The large one needs at least 30 guests and it lacks intimacy. Don't pay too much attention to anything my wife says. She's a good woman, but a little inexperienced. Everything's royal here. Like the kings of France, I keep carps as big as whales. It takes 8 hours to make a complete tour of the estate. I'll show you tomorrow. Isidore, you're preventing the gentlemen from eating. Am I stopping you from eating? - Not at all, Madam. Luckily I warned you. You'll see it all: my 160 dairy cows, my 230 Nivernais cattle, my sheepfolds, my drainage systems, my nurseries, the whole lot. My friend, you're boring our guests. I'm boring you? - No, Madam. Excuse her. Come on, missus. In brief, my estate extends over two departments, eight county towns and twenty-four communes. Please excuse me. I'd like to retire, mummy. What's the matter? I don't feel well. - You're not eating? No, thank you. - Off you go. Sorry to hear it, miss. Sorry, miss. Again... Germaine has another of her spells. Ah, these intellectuals. It's all that reading, nothing else. Miss never stops reading. She even reads poetry. Do you realize? Lamartine, Hugo, whatever, Musset, you know what all that is... A load of horseshit! Do you read? The stock market and railway indicators. What about you, Gru... Gru... - Gruggh. Herbert Gruggh. I keep forgetting your name. Do you read? The occasional short story. Yes. Well, I never read. I never read. Yet, I am Isidore Lechat, squire and rich with 100 million. I own a newspaper where I shape public opinion, literary, political, philosophical... Pass me the Bordeaux. Gustave, the office boy, told me all about it. Dauphin begged Lechat who was ruining him on the stock market. You know the old man. He let him cry, scream, beg, grovel...for nothing. He went home and killed himself. - One must be devoid of pity to do that. What revolts me... At night, at the table, he recounts his successes: how he bamboozled this one, how he tricked that one. He's wicked. Here there's not a piece of land from which he hasn't evicted the former occupant. And he calls himself friend of the people.... Thief. Thief. Not a spot, not a tuft of grass where you place your foot that hasn't been stolen. Money, your money, your foul money every time. Get out. Get out of here. Thief. Thief. Thief. Thief, thief, thief. What are you doing here at this time of night? You wonder what prompted my visit. It's simple: I simply can't bear it anymore. There are limits to what one can bear. Tonight, I suddenly had the feeling of a heavy weight upon my soul, of being suffocated. You've been crying. Maybe. Oh, it was so cold coming here. But now it's over, I'm close to you. Germaine, darling. What if someone had followed you? - So what? I'm suffocating in this house where every day, every hour counts as an injustice, a misfortune. What do I care if they find me here since I want to be yours, Lucien? You would accept? - To become your wife? Yes, Lucien, I've decided. This way I too will have my share of happiness. I'm going to marry you, Germaine. But above all, you must get me out of here quickly. Let's run away without waiting. You won't regret it? I don't have any money... Oh no, not that word. Not that word between us, it hurts me, it hurts me so much. Take me away, Lucien. Take me away. You don't answer? You're so rich, they'll accuse me of... I would never accept to take a single franc of my father's fortune. Be reassured, Lucien. All I'm bringing to you is my love. So... - So nothing can keep us apart any longer. It's weird, this morning I'm feeling out of sorts, like I don't have any self-belief. I assure you this man is a fool. If he was such a fool, he wouldn't have all this money. Remember all those yarns he was spinning to us last night. This series of sublime scams. A lucky man and a nutjob. We will get what we want from him. Sometimes one must be careful of this kind of fools... His eyes are ghastly. You never change. No guts. And you, no eye. Didn't you look closely at him? He's vain, an upstart. - A man capable of bettering us. I'd like to see that. Hold on. You're saying they're only partners in this business? Phinck is the engineer, are you sure? The other is the financier... lacking finances. Okay. Okay, thanks. Goodbye. Mr de la Fontenelle. - Miss. Will you do me a favor? - Gladly. Has Jules the gardener already left Vauperdu? Yesterday evening, Miss, but he'll be back soon. Will you give him this bit of money, but don't tell him who it's from? He won't be fooled, Miss. Mr de la Fontenelle, yesterday evening there was a painful scene, a scene... Miss. I beg your pardon for my father's conduct. Excuse me. We're taking turns. I don't deserve your kindness, Miss, I lived a bad life. I had become... or rather I was about to become... when I met your father. Without him or rather without you, what would I have become here? You can't know. You're unhappy. That's all I need to know about you. 10am, time to go to mass. You come with us? I went at 7am. When nobody's there? Yet, you know that your father does not want us to miss high mass at this time. Why doesn't he go himself? He's anti-clerical this year. However, he thinks it useful that we go, to be seen. We must give him satisfaction. Oh, that's delightful. It's a political ruse. - Well, I won't be part of it. Really, Germaine, what's the matter with you? If something's up, tell me. I am your mother. But mummy... Have you been denied anything? I've two children: a son who's never here and a daughter whose mind is constantly elsewhere and of which I know nothing. What's the point of being rich, I'm asking you. It's not my fault. So you'll let me go alone? - Yes. In that case I'll have the carriage ready. All alone in that big car, it makes me quite uncomfortable. It may sound silly but... what do you want, I feel ashamed. I need a companion or some packets. A lot of packets. Anyway... I hope those two gentlemen will be leaving this evening. You don't find them somewhat fishy? All the people my father brings here look the same. - Like businessmen. If I was Isidore, I'd be suspicious. They might say the same thing. - Germaine! Let's go over it one more time... Leave it to me. It's not you who invented this trick after all. All the same, we'll have to let him feel he's still winning something. As little as possible. On the question of salaries, be inflexible. Yes. Don't dwell on the location of the waterfall in the militarized zone. And especially on the resulting installation difficulties. Of course. And you don't reveal the name nor address. Save that for when he can't back out. And above all, don't talk all the time. It's unbearable when you talk, you confuse the clearest things! This is exactly what is needed! - Not all the time. You think I'm an idiot? - Shush. Mr. Lechat asks the gentlemen to come in. The official painter of Presidents of the Republic. It isn't bad, huh? Oh, hold on. Ah yes, yes. Check this out! A gem. - Yes. Not bad. And here's the bureau of Napoleon. - The third? The first! 400000F at the sale of the Duc de Laudy. A gem. - Admirable. Have a seat. Some port? Gladly. - Here. Thanks. - Thanks. Taste this. Oh, prodigious. - Admirable. 1840. It's something else, eh? Well, now, let's hear it. Ah, you're the speaker. Go ahead, and no fancy stuff. You know enough about developments in European industry to know that the future belongs to electricity. Spare me the generalities, this isn't an inauguration ceremony. Get to the point. In two words: It is about giving France the largest generating plant in Europe. No less! I dare say that the deal we're offering you has a double advantage. Firstly, it's patriotic. Like all business. Secondly, it's an admirable offer. Ah, that remains to be seen. Since I'm addressing a well-informed man, I don't need to list everything that electricity can be used for. No, pass on that. However, you might ask me... I'm asking nothing. Get to the point! Where's it located, this plant of 20000 horsepower? This incomparable plant is located in the mountains, 26kms from an industrial town, whose contract with the gas company expires in 3 years. A new municipality, intelligent, on the side of progress, who want nothing more than to sign up with you. A few back-handers, the usual. 3 spas, 12 large hotels and... this is where lies the exceptional nature of this deal: the surrounding land is very rich in bauxite. Ah. You can see the importance of the deal: the bauxite, the heat and the power. It's incalculable. That's good, we are not calculating yet. And you own this plant? Well... of course. You are the true owners? Yes, yes. - I was going to tell you... You aren't the owner? Yes in a manner of speaking, we are promised a sale. By whom? - The owner of the plant. Then you'll be the owners? Lads, you're too kind, both of you, and I'm probably an old fool, but your proposal doesn't interest me. Why not? I never start a new venture which I know nothing about. We don't want to hide anything from you but you don't let me explain. You keep interrupting us all the time. I'm asking you who the owner is, I need to know the name of the owner! What's his name? He's called Joseph, Joseph Bruneau. Well, it took long enough. Bruneau... Yes, he raised about 6 million. An estimate was made and work commenced, but of the 10kms of tunnels to be dug, barely 3 were finished when the 6 million ran out. We were slightly out with our estimate. You don't say... And then? Bruneau realized then that he was at our discretion. So we signed a new contract which commits us to take over the enterprise and to compensate him as far as is possible, on the condition that he raises a little fresh capital for us. I see... Poor Bruneau. So, where's this plant? Where is it? In Saint-Carex. Near Grenoble. - Near Grenoble. Saint-Carex? You know, I've heard of Saint-Carex. It's in the military zone. - A minor detail of no importance. Really? Well, you're the only one who thinks that. There's the authorisations to obtain, the months or years of delay, the time lost and the money wasted, you call all that a detail? We don't proceed blindly, we have some influence in high places. And other capital somewhere else, no doubt, therefore you don't need me, proceed by yourselves. I prefer it that way. A small port, 1840. Drink to the health of poor Bruneau. It's the same bottle, although you seem to find it less appealing. Right, cards on the table, I'm not Bruneau! With all your reticence, I can't picture the deal clearly, but I will look into it, it seems promising. I'll give you my conditions. Take them or leave them. What's your estimate for the initial works, labour, construction, machines? 4... 20 millions. 4 or 20? - 80. - 80? Well! We'll see about that. I'm in charge of raising the capital, but only after proper examination. That goes without saying. I'm in charge of negotiations with the ministry. As for Bruneau, I don't know him and I want nothing to do with him. But that poor man... You ripped him off the first time, you don't need me the second time. About your estimate, I'm warning you, if it's excessive, it will be deducted from your shares. Those shares are divided equally between us three? Us three? You and you makes 1, me makes 1, 1 and 1, that makes 2. Where's the 3rd? And I intend to be sole leader of the business. Since I'm the one bringing the money, I get all the commissions on the markets with the entrepreneurs. There will be no commission. That would mean I scammed myself and that would astonish me. We haven't discussed our salaries. You don't want one. Come on, we are not employees. I have my patent all the same. Patent? What patent? Well, my patent. - I see... I'm not holding you here. There's a train at 6.30. We can't accept your conditions, you're robbing us blind. You're slitting our throats. Then let's leave it at that. We're discussing business, we can't agree, it happens every day. However this doesn't prevent feelings. The most annoyed will be Bruneau, poor man. He interests me after all. I'm going to pay him a visit. What do you say? An interview with Bruneau in Cock's Crow. That could be quite... moving. Plus I'll also need to pay a visit to the War Ministry. What do you think? We need to think about it. Well then, that changes everything, lads, that changes everything. The roses are for the dining room. Hello. - Hello. Your room's ready, Xavier. - Ah, thanks. I can't dally. - You're just passing through? You don't expect me to stay here forever. By the way, how is the old man doing? Is he in good form? He's the same as always. I took the chance to stop by because I'm participating this afternoon in the annual hunting party at Chante?ay's. I had an invite. - Really? Doesn't it ring a bell? It includes the top names in France. So is ours. Celebrated people in different capacities. Poor Xavier. Okay... let's revisit certain numbers. Yes, we'll do certain calculations. You have until 6pm. If you agree, you can write up a contract, but strictly on the basis that I have given you. All we want to find is an agreement... A common ground. - That's it, obviously. Father. Hello. Xavier has arrived. - Where is he? He has a hunting appointment in the area, he's waiting for you at the stables. Parents don't matter, but horses... Come on, let's go. You'll meet him later. He's something else, my boy. Don't forget, eh? 6pm. See you later. Which horse can I take, Legris? Le Glorieux? Sunfish? Why not Cary? It depends. Will you be following like a tourist or will you be jumping? I won't be lagging behind. What's that? It wasn't here when I left. Old man Lechat's stables. - That scoundrel has it all. His son seems a decent sort. Yes. He has easy money and is a polo lancer. 12 ponies all to himself. No less! Oh, there he is. Hey, Lechat! Hello! - Oh, hi! Well, come on over! Come on! You are selecting your horse for later? - Yes. Xavier Lechat, Melchior de Porcellet. Good to see you, Mr. Explorer. Hello you. Hello, daddy. - No kiss for your old man? We've heard lots about you, Mr de Porcellet Count Alain de Chante?ay. - A pleasure. Just like that, you went off exploring. It's admirable. I only followed the course of the Amazon for eleven months. A simple excursion. Indeed. Remind the marquis I'm expecting him at 2pm. Of course, sir. You know, my dear, this won't be a hunt. It is above all a pretext to get the horses and dogs some fresh air. Well Legris, no stable births? Births? Come on, they're not sheep to my knowledge. Good old Legris! Everything is square with you. Shall we be seeing the stallion? Le Grand Duc? Yes, but not close up, he's a bit frisky this morning. Say, you know I've bought Le Grand Duc? Under the noses of the Americans. Nice gesture. - Nice deal you mean. He's worth 40000F in breeding. Daddy dear, we need a serious talk. Ah, I don't like the sound of this. See you later! I sense this is going to cost me dear. Some little woman? Heck no. I'm sick of affairs of the heart. Good boy. So, how much? Well, not cheap. How much? 300000. Well, my boy, your stories are short but not amusing. In your case, one business deal tomorrow and it's forgotten. You're something else. 300000! And this can't be fixed? Debt of honour. - Oh, to the devil with honour. Where there's money, there's no honour, there's a deal and it must be dealt with. Not in my world. "In my world." The things you say... Ah, my dear boy. Come on. Won't you mind leaving your mother maybe forever? My mother? She thinks she loves me, but her heart has been hardened by habit. Her conscience has disappeared in this opulence which she doesn't know how to cope with, besides. Perhaps you expected a bit too much of her? I just wanted her to smile occasionally, to show some feeling, some kindness. She could have justified this house, mitigated the harm he's caused. Instead, she defends him, serves him and helps him if necessary. What else could she do? What I blame her for is not not loving me. It's that I couldn't love her as I would have liked to love my mother. But I'm sure you do love her. As for my father, with his mania for marrying me off, for him I've become an object of speculation, better yet: a purchase premium. Don't be unjust. What about your brother? Xavier? With him, it's very simple. As soon as he was old enough to understand, he hasn't hesitated. He follows tradition, he spends money willy-nilly without a second thought. It's a splendid and terrifying example of the law of restitution. Naturally, he's their favourite. Is your chequebook in its usual place? Yes, however you shouldn't get used to these little bail-outs, because Daddy Lechat's piggy bank isn't bottomless. Here. Ah. I'll do it this time, but you must win it back for me. If I can. You can, very much. Are you still friends with young De Bragard? The general's son? Henry? Yes, he's a good chap. They do not have money. - So what? He's still a good chap. I need his support in a deal worth at least 30 million. Oh, say, steady on. A general isn't like a deputy. Yes, but it will have to work the same way. You have Porcellet. He's the general's first cousin. Son of a bitch, that's right, I don't know how to approach Porcellet but I'll think about what you've said. It's very interesting. Does the general's son have influence over his father? Like all sons over their fathers. Stop making fun of me now that you've got what you want. Seriously now... could you bring him to me for lunch? That's a bit tricky. - Why? You're a bit... of a hot potato. - What? Oh, dad, I think you're amazing. I'll speak to him, I'll try to get him onboard. Don't try. Get him onboard. - How much will you give me? Hey! You can double your investment on this deal, or else business is no longer business. That's not bad! And it makes sense. The party is going to cut through the forest of Compi?gne, I'm invited to join. - Bravo. The marquis de Porcellet. He's punctual this marquis. Punctuality is the politeness of the ruined. You're funny. - I'm off. Ah, Marquis, it's been a long time. It's strange, we're neighbours, on good terms, we only see each other every 18 months. The thousand preoccupations of life. - Yes. I saw your son this morning. Has he told you? - No. I've been delighted to see a famous explorer. He's looking so well. Nothing like travel to build character in the young. The bush of Central America is often less dangerous than Parisian boudoirs. Very fair. And it's cheaper for daddy. My dear Mr Lechat, I'm very pleased to see you. In addition to the enjoyment this visit gives me... Gives us. I'd like to raise an urgent matter with you. The settlement for the liquidation of Gasselin's assets. He's the wood merchant. I know. - There's been no progress. The solicitor wrote to me that I can expect nothing. Nothing. - That's your opinion too? Nothing. - This is a big loss to me. I have some major deadlines coming up, and I'm rather embarrassed. Therefore I've come to ask if you'll loan me another 300000F. We'll see about that. - You'd be rescuing me, dear Mr. Lechat. Just this morning I glanced at your file. You have 4 bonds of 300000F, another of 500000, making 1700000, the 8% interest unpaid for 2 years... Yes 2 years, no less! Yes. This makes 1972000F. Is this correct? - Perfectly correct. Yes, well... I'm sorry but this time it's impossible. - What, you refuse? I'm sorry, believe me. I've brought you guarantees. Another mortgage, your land is up to the eyeballs in them. Not at all! Your estate is poorly managed. Your farms don't hold up and you have ransacked your woods. If I get a million and a half from it, I'd be surprised. What do you mean by that exactly? I have other guarantees, my honour. Yes, I know what it's worth, but in business... I have a part in my aunt's inheritance, she's 83.. Oh, inheritances! And you are an indirect descendant, the Tax Bureau will clean you out. That's fine. All I can do then is apologise for this misstep... Oh no, please, we can't part like this. I like you, Marquis, and I have much sympathy for you, I enjoy your company, and I'd like to find a solution to get you out of this disastrous situation. "Disastrous" is an exaggeration. My situation isn't great, but it isn't desperate. Oh yes, Marquis, it is. Oh yes, it is. Ah... Isn't this beautiful, Porcellet, eh? What's going on? - We have lost our way. We're heading for the plain, watch out for the ditch. I want to tell you something, a long time ago I had a fantasy of bringing together the Vauperdu and Porcellet lands. Ah, what an admirable estate that would make, Marquis. And I can realise this dream. Tomorrow, if I wanted. However I've much sympathy for you, and I'm wondering if before such a drastic solution we can't find some grounds for conciliation, like the good folk we are. Let's grab a drink inside. You're anxious. Oh no, but you don't know life's realities. I've confronted them many times. The idea of going through that again where I almost succumbed alone. There are two of us fighting now. I'll be cheerful again when we get out of here. I am the cheerful sort, me. So what do you propose? An admirable union, Marquis. The trouble is, you're a man of great principles, you remain attached to prejudices that are no longer valid today. That's a shame. Chivalrous but not practical. Remaining impractical in a society that is too much so, it's the raison d'?tre of nobility and its glory moreover. Oh no, it'll be the death of it. - Then so be it, sir. With us, honour comes before gain. Don't think that means I'm against progress. So what is this union? Well, it's this, it's a deal. I'm no diplomat, I'll cut to the chase. You have a ruined son, I have a rich daughter, let's marry them. What did you say? - Let's marry them. And since I know how this works, I'll give you full acquittance of the 2 million you owe me. You'll retain all your property titles. As you see, when it comes down to it, that scoundrel Lechat knows how to act like a gentleman. It's impossible. You can't mean it. But I do mean it. And I mean as well to give my daughter an annuity of 500000F. I say an annuity because the capital is better if it stays under my control, it'll work better with me. You're treating people like cattle. - No, it's a business deal. You want to buy me. Here you go again with the big words. You'll regret it when you are forced to leave your estate with lawyers at your heels! I've been ruined twice, it's no joke. You're buying me. - Oh no. Business is a matter of exchange. We exchange money, land, electoral mandates, what one has against what one doesn't. Nothing could be more honorable. But my son has no intention of getting married. Ah. Sometimes life's difficulties modify one's intentions. Ah, Marquis, if you will let me guide you, the two of us could do some fantastic business together. Say, that Hotel de Porcellet, rue de Varenne, that your brother deserted, it belongs to you now, doesn't it? I could buy it back, and then add it to my daughter's wedding gifts. Not bad for the coat of arms that. Note that in the trade we make, you're giving as much as me. And if you really think about it, your contribution is greater than mine. If someone is bought off in this deal it's not you, it's me. For example... You enjoy a certain reputation with General de Bragard. He's your first cousin. He's about to be appointed Director of Military engineering at the Ministry. Nothing escapes you. It's my job. Well, just now, I need him for an amazing deal... In which I can give you a stake. There won't be huge returns, but it's for the national defense. And I'm a patriot. Call me what you like, but I'm a patriot. And there's something else. - There's more? Yes, in this constituency you have a certain electoral influence. You could use it to assist my candidature. Not openly, oh no. I'd tell you what to do. But think it over. It's not just my name you want to buy, it's also my personal credit. Is there more besides? You sadden me, Marquis. You sadden me. If you make impossible this agreement that I desire, I will be consoled, believe me, with nothing less than the beautiful land of Porcellet. My dream. The thing is, you're running against the Duke de Maugis whose ideas, that I share, are diametrically opposed to yours : revolutionary and anticlerical. Once elected, programmes are soon forgotten. And too bad if the land dies, huh? This kind of compromise is not in use in our world. But nobility is dead, Mr Marquis. If I'm as dead as you say, why do you want me? Because I like you. Let me tell you that I'm proud, as part of this aristocracy, never to have submitted to this abominable demagogy that replaces with a cult of money the cult of honour, of the nation, of faith, of compassion. - Go ahead, indulge yourself! You want to be the masters, and you are for the moment. But as master you have only one idea: to ape us. You buy our hotels, our land, you need our manias, our vices, our old glorious names, even our old furniture, but what can't be bought is knowing what to do with it. When you appeared, I had only, one thought: to crush you. But, I don't know why, you moved me. Most people don't realise, I have a heart. Therefore I have tried to... You know, my daughter is very pretty. And she conducts herself like a little princess. I never questioned her qualities. Then don't make me go back to my original thought. It's impossible. - Come on. I'm having a good day, take the opportunity. It's very difficult. You would not be the first to agree to such alliances. No, of course... The decisions I am asking you to take are not so reprehensible. Of course not. Regarding the elections, it will seem normal to everyone that you wish the success of your daughter-in-law's father. In any case, I've not yet consulted my son yet. You think I've consulted my daughter? The children will obey their parents. I immediately thought when I saw your little son the explorer earlier: "he won't adjust so easily to the difficulty of earning a living now." Don't worry, I won't ask you to introduce them to each other today. Well, I'll see, I'll consider your offer. Oh no. I want all this settled when you walk out of here. In addition to everything else, it's understood that I'm giving you your 300000F. And I'll deal with your other creditors. So, Marquis, I can bring in my wife and my daughter? Do it, sir. You're not taking the evening dresses? No. Just those two little dresses? Miss won't be away for long? The jewelry? - Ah no. Yes, hand me my small box, would you? My chain and my medallion. Miss isn't going... for good? Why do you ask me this? - Because... Not a word to anyone, eh? What about me, Miss? Oh, nanny. Come in! Sir wants you in his office. Tell him I'll be right down. Come in, my child. Sit down. The Marquis de Porcellet has something to say to us. It's up to you, Marquis. Madame, I have the honour of asking you on behalf of my son Melchior, Count de Porcellet, for the hand of Ms Germaine Lechat, your daughter. But I... - Well, well... what's wrong with you? They're asking for her hand, don't you realise? Yes, yes, but my head's reeling. The joy of a mother, Marquis. Well, pull yourself together, for God's sake. And you, answer... It's a great honour. I don't know to what I owe it, but I refuse. You refuse, Miss? You haven't understood, he's asking you to marry his son. I refuse, sir. I regret that my father didn't consult with me first, it could have saved us this painful and humiliating scene. Don't listen to her. My daughter hasn't understood, it's the shock, the joy, the pride... but she accepts. - I refuse. You find the house of Porcellet unworthy of you? The daughter of Lechat cannot find anyone unworthy. No, sir, I refuse because I am not free. You're not free? No. - Why's this? I have a lover. You... What did you say? What did you say? She's joking, she doesn't know what she's saying. My daughter has a lover! That's a good one! I am engaged, promised to a man I love. We have given ourselves to each other, freely. This surprises you, sir? Say something instead of making a face! Make her shut up, will you? My God, this had to happen. They're mad. It's all a misunderstanding, Marquis, I'll sort my family out. See you tomorrow. It seems we've nothing more to say to each other. What? - Goodbye, sir. You don't want to deal with me anymore? It's over between us? Please behave yourself. Ah, it's like that? You think the matter is settled between us? The stamped papers will be sent in due place tomorrow! As you wish! - Scoundrel! Here I come! And don't look at me like that! Please, no fireworks, I'm leaving. But don't think you're chasing me away, I'm leaving of my own accord. What's just happened has only brought my decision a day closer. Those books, those filthy books. This is what they've done to my daughter! But who raised and nourished you? These luxuries I've given you, your dresses! They burn the skin. - Oh stop it. Leave her, she's a complete fool! She's the one who is insulting us now! I've done nothing to be reproached for. The lover I told about only served as a pretext for my distress. So you lied in front the Marquis? Yes. And I've blown a good deal! Don't take it that way, I've cracked tougher nuts than you. There's nothing you can do to me. Leave her! - Out of my way! Who is it? Where did you dig him up? Answer! Answer, will you?! I'll make you talk! Lucien! Lucien? Lucien! Oh no! Lucien! What's the matter? - Get ready. He's after me. Your father? - I've told him everything. You little bastard! Be careful, sir. I won't put up with any violence. Are you going to give me a lecture too? Don't make me laugh! I'm warning you. You don't have my money yet. Nobody wants your money. It's a classic move, embroil the heiress, go as far as you can, then fix it with the family. And finally let's all kiss and roll in Lechat's millions. But you've been kidding yourself. Germaine renounces her inheritance. But what are you thinking?! She won't get a single franc! I'm counting on it. Even when you come home begging and starving, soon enough, you won't get anything! I'd welcome starvation! It'd be something from you I could finally accept. Fool! And this is my daughter. And him, the only man I loved besides my son! I must have been nuts! Come on, reconsider this. - It's all considered. Oh yes? Enough talk! Is it money you want? What's your price! You'll be the first to blackmail me. It will serve you as a reference! How much? - You don't understand, sir. You can't understand. Imbecile! What the hell, I don't care about you two! You can go to the devil! A fool and a madwoman! Nice couple! Go and die of hunger anywhere you want! Get off my land right now! Don't let me find you here this evening! A nice fall, by the looks of it. - An accident rather. Let's see. It can't be. You're not deserting me, Germaine? It's too late, mummy. - What's too late, what do you mean? Let me talk to him. Not today, in a few days. Soon, anyway. Tomorrow. Talk to him about what? I'll make him reconsider. He'll agree to your marriage with Mr Garraud. Don't talk to me about him. Okay, I won't talk about him, but what about me, your mother? You'll stay with me, won't you? I have to go. What will become of me, alone in this great house? You know, at my age... Germaine! - Mummy! Mummy! We never loved you as we should have, but you never said anything either. We were strangers to each other. However I love you all the same. If we'd lived in a small house, none of this would've happened. It's this ch?teau, this luxury, all this money! But you can't go, you're not going to leave me? You're all I have. - Come with us, mum. Oh, I've spent my life with him, we were poor together, I can't abandon him. Stay with me. Don't ask me the impossible. It's too late, mum. Too late. Don't leave me. - Get off me, mum. Germaine! Germaine! Germaine! Don't go, Germaine, don't go. I will love you. I will love you. - Mum, let me go. Germaine! - Let me go. Will you write to me? - Yes, mum. Promise me you'll write! Hello, is that Grassin's offices? Ah, it's you, Grassin. This is Lechat. I'll have my chauffeur bring you the file on Porcellet. Start proceedings at once. No, no compromise, go for the jugular. Yes. That's all. Good evening. She's gone. - To the devil! That's all you can say! Do something, send a car, go yourself! Bring her! Bring her back! - Oh, stop your hysterics! Well, I've had enough as well! This is all your fault. Don't mind me. If you want to join them, be my guest! You'd deserve it! Come on, the whole world against me, bring it on! Make my day! But I'll have the last laugh here! Sir! - What is it? Come quickly. Well, well, well... this could change everything. This is very bad. That's not how I see it. - Do you have some stamped paper? Yes. Come on. Sir! What is it? - A misfortune, a terrible misfortune. Don't tell me. But I won't tell you about it, it's not your concern. Your child. - My girl. It's not about her. - She's gone. That's it. But... - What? Have you gone mad too? You don't understand, Mr. Xavier, your son... Well? - An accident. An accident? What are you talking about? Oh, it's awful, sir. Mr Xavier... is dead. What? What? What... What did you say? Idiot, imbecile. Why don't you repeat what you just said? Let go of me. Earlier, while hunting, Mr. Xavier, while jumping a hedgerow, fell so badly that... That...? Courage, sir. Courage. My boy... My little boy. My little boy... Where is he? - He'll be here in a moment. And Madame? - I haven't dared tell her. Alright. I'm suffocating. Don't, sir. I must go to him. I must go to my boy. What a terrible misfortune! We extend our condolences to you. Oh, my good friends! Yes, your associates. We would like to give you some consolation. Alas, in the face of such misfortune, there is none. Only time... and even then... I've lost everything, lost everything in one day. Such a handsome young man. Earlier, he was just here, so happy. You loved him greatly. You didn't deserve this. Courage, don't fall apart. Oh, now... Excuse us if... if we interrupt your mourning for a moment... We well know... how painful business is at times like this, but... the private agreement that you asked us to write... Do you remember? No, not today, leave me in peace. We must insist... - No. No. We're leaving, we're catching the train at 6.30. Ah, you're leaving. Thieves! You have exploited my weakness, you wanted to speculate on my pain, you swine! Swine! Did we miss something out? Come here. Sit down. Write! There! "Mr Isidore Lechat means to..." Get on with it. Madam, gather your courage, perhaps some small hope... ...expressly reserves the right to the financial and commercial management of said business." "of said business." "And this without Mr. Gruggh and Mr. Phinck who abandon all rights in this respect..." "all rights in this respect..." "to be able to intervene or oppose in any way..." Monsieur. I'm coming. "...in any subsequent operations that will be deemed expedient by Mr. Isidore Lechat alone." Sign now. Initial it here. You'll have my signature, tomorrow. My little boy. THE END
