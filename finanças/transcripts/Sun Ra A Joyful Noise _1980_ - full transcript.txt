- Planet Earth can't even be sufficient without the rain, it doesn't produce rain you know. Sunshine, it doesn't produce the sun. The wind, it doesn't produce the wind. All Planet Earth produces is the dead bodies of humanity. That's it's only creation. Everything else comes from outer space. From unknown regions. Humanity's life depends upon the unknown. Knowledge... Is laughable when attributed to a human being.

Names of splendor, names of shame. I have many names, some call me Mister Ra, others call me mystery, you can call me Mister Mystery. ("Mister Ra/Mystery" by Sun Ra) The chaos on this planet is due to the music that musicians are playin', that they are forced to play by some who just think of money, and don't realize that music is a spiritual language, and it represents the people of Earth. When musicians are compelled to play anything, it goes straight to the throne of the creator of the Universe, and that is how he sees you, according to your music, because see, music is a universal language, and what you call musicians that play, it's what goes to the creator as your personal ambassador, and your personal nemesis. (avant-garde jazz) With all the churches you've got, and all the schools you've got, all the governments you've got, you're supposed to have a better plan than this. Worldly man has failed, spiritually, educationally, governmentally, he's failed. Worldly, he should be a good sport and say I give up, I need help, what I am right here is a bridge for them to get help, when they could listen to see what am I talking about. They'd get a surprise, because I'm talking about equations that are in their books. Books from way back in ancient Egypt, in Greece, and Rome, and their philosophers have been talking, a touch of everything I'm talkin'.

In my music, I speak of unknown things. And possible things, ancient things, potential things. No two songs tell the same story. They say that history repeats itself, but history is only his story. We haven't heard my story yet. My story is different from his story. My story is not part of history. Because history repeats itself, but my story is in this, that never repeats itself. Why should it? A sunset does not repeat itself, neither does the sunrise. Nature never repeats itself, why should I repeat myself ("Space Loneliness Blues" by Sun Ra) Somehow ancient Egypt is thought of as a kingdom of bondage. It would be better to say, the kingdom of discipline. The kingdom of precision, the kingdom of culture, beauty, art, would be better to say that, because this is the proof of it. The stones speak, the stones are speaking through vibrations of beauty, vibrations of discipline, vibrations of precision, yes the stones speak to the people of planet Earth. If teenagers are lost, it is because they have been feared upon the word freedom not discipline. - Well some writers, a nice group that, I live a few doors away from Sun Ra, is a nice group, players who are performing Sun Ra are nice men, because I see them everyday, and Sun Ra's music is good music. - And one of them owns a store, and they be at you like, the space, and things like that, and they're alright people. (store chatter) - Yeah the story was started because I feel somethin' needed to be done in the neighborhood for the ones who'll listen, the young ones who'll listen, and I believe in discipline, and I believe children should be taught discipline from a young age. When they get older, there won't be no problems. I've been over here about a year and a half, the Pharaoh's Den, and another reason the store was started, I wanted to do somethin' in the name of ancient pharaohs, and very few people do things in the name of the ancient pharaohs. Well now you see right over there, I've got a sign, space is the place, so I try to teach the children about space, outer space, precision and discipline, and like on our side of my science, they feel afraid of the nations of the world for seven years so I might be here seven years maybe. - [Sun Ra] They said that the language of ancient Egypt is no longer spoken, but nature never loses anything. It is still spoken. I'm sitting in front of the White House, lookin' over across the street, but I don't see the black house, that's where it ought to be, because you can't have a white house, if you don't have a black house. In fact, you can't have anything unless you have a comparison, you can't have a good government unless you have an evil government. You can't have righteousness unless you've got the wicked with you, you can't have anything without its parallel and its opposite. This is something that the people of Earth aren't aware of, you can't have a Justice department that goes out lookin' for only criminals, and never go out lookin' for people who are doing good. You can't have justice if you penalize people for doing wrong, and don't do anything to help them when they tryin' to do right. - [Voiceover] Sun Ra, could you tell us why you're here tonight? - Well, I'd just like to play a requiem for Trevor Johnson, a former member of the band who left the planet about the previous year. - [Voiceover] Does this have any special meaning for you? - The requiem? Well it'd be the first time one would root for a poor, unfortunate man. (applause) ("Requiem for Trevor Johnson" by Sun Ra) Those of the reality have lost their way. Now they must listen to what myth has to say. Those of the reality, have been bruised and beaten by the truths, those of the reality have been slaves of a bad truth. So there's nothin' left now but the myth. The myth is neither bad nor good. It's potentials are unlimited. Somewhere else on the other side of nowhere, there's another place in space, beyond what you know as time. Where the gods of mythology dwell. Gods that are not real to you. Gods who have created the illusion that they do not exist to the people of planet Earth. These gods dwell in their mythocracy. Opposed to your theocracy, and your democracy, and your monacracy. They dwell in their mythocracy, a magic world that makes things to be, these gods can even offer you immortality. ("'Round Midnight" by Thelonious Monk/Cootie Williams) We hold this myth to be potential. They hold their truths to be self-evident, but our myth is not self-evident, because it is a mystery. I'm not part of history, I'm more a part of the mystery, which is my story. (saxophone solo) - [Voiceover] Why is one of the most highly respected saxophone players in the country, stayed so many years with Sun Ra. - Well he was the first one to really introduce me into how forms of music, you know, pair, for what you might would say, what Bird, and Monk, and the fellows were doin'. I didn't think anybody was ahead of them, until I met Sun Ra, you know, and I played with him, on and off, for about six months, and I could read real well, and I just come out the Army playin' solo clarinets, so reading was no problem. Any music that he showed me, I could read it pretty well, but I didn't really understand it. I couldn't hear it for about six months. Then one night, I heard it. We were playin' this number Saturn, I had been playin' it for six months every time we worked, but then I really heard the intervals this one night, and I said, my gosh, this man is more stretched out than Monk. It's unbelievable that anybody could write any meaner intervals than Monk or Mingus you know, but he does, his intervals, his knowledge of intervals and harmony, very highly advanced you know, so when I saw that, I said well, I think I'll make this the stop, you know. ("Ankh" by Sun Ra) - About ten years ago, the New York Times stated that I had bypassed the space age, and I have, but the space age can be a bridge to the omniverse age, and that's what I'm talkin' about to members of the band, hopin' that they will make it, because it's judgment day for them as well as for everybody else, as to whether they can be accepted by somethin' that's totally pure and eternal, and it's not based on righteousness, and it's not based on evil, as I said, they're teaching that God wants all the righteous people, and they're teachin' that the Devil wants all un-righteous ones, but they can't get in my band that way. They might get in God's heaven by bein' righteous, and get in the Devil's kingdom by bein' un-righteous. That won't help them with me. - There's about six or seven of us. There's Marshall Allen, Eloe Omoe, Jacson, Danny Thompson, Sun Ra, and myself, and guests that come through you know, there's always a place downstairs for somebody, but basically speaking, it's between six to seven of us living here at all times you know. - [Voiceover] What is our plan man? - Organizers, and everything works out unbelievable. Chaos, but if this works out, it comes right on in together. It's hard to even put down in words, on paper, or on film. - [Voiceover] You couldn't say how that works out, it just works out, it just works you know. You can get somebody from Timbuktu man, and you know if, or Sunny's got that ability that leaders have of being able to pick the person that's going to fit, and they fit you know, whether it's for one gig, ten gigs, or for the rest of time you know? - [Voiceover] It might be at four in the morning, it might be at six in the morning, it might be from six in the morning to 12 at night, and you know, it might be anytime you know, you just have to be ready, if you're out somewhere, you better come on back in and you know get to rehearsal. - [Voiceover] Does that hurt the social life? - Social life? No, in music you know you've got folks go out there in music right, now that's their social life right? Well I'm getting my social life here. We have music all night, you know. - Sometimes it's tough you know, but the sincerity of wanting to be a part of the music, you don't really mind that you know, at times you have to give up a lot of pleasures you want to get into, like maybe goin' out to enjoy yourself you can't do it, because you gotta stay here and rehearse, but once you get into the music, you forget all about the other thing that happened, because the music have you so into it, that the rest of it don't even matter. (avant-garde jazz) - E flat. (avant-garde jazz) Leave out the end. Leave out the end. You better leave out the end. Okay, one, two, one, two. One, two, three, four. (avant-garde jazz) One, two, three, play. (avant-garde jazz) - Well I was going, you know, I'm gonna live where Sun Ra lives, if he's a leader, and you're followin' the leader, you live where the leader lives. You know it's the easiest thing to me anyway now. - I basically choose musicians who believe in orchestration, discipline, and precision. Not too many musicians have demonstrated that. (avant-garde jazz) - I named this drum, or rather, Sun Ra did, name this drum an ancient infinity lightning wood drum, it got lightning wood from the fact that it was taken from a tree that was struck by lightning directly in back of me, which is, you can see the remains of it, the stump right opposite the fence on the other side of the fence, and the tree was standing directly opposite the house, 5626 Morton Street. Now when lightning struck the tree, and they came to cut down the remains of the tree, and take it off, I saw a large piece of the wood, a large piece of the tree, and decided to, or I had been told I needed a drum anyway. He told me one day, in the next day, lightning struck the tree across the street from the house, and that started the drum, so I spent a summer hollowing it out, and figuring out how to put a head on it, and doing a base relief carving on the face of it, on the body of it, which is a verse out of the book of the reawakening, which is an Egyptian book commonly known as the book of the dead. I had played drums on and off, but you know just hand drums, kunga drums, but I didn't really know anything about drumming, except what I had picked up from other people. Sun Ra of course showed me a whole 'nother idea about drumming. ("Ancient Egyptian Infinity Lightning Drum" by Sun Ra) - It's better to deal with the people who have intuition now. You see they don't know what they're doing. The ones who do know what they're doing, haven't proven anything. ("Rock-Si-Chord Solo" by Sun Ra) The police knocked on the door, and one of them said that they had some complaints from the neighbors, and it's because of noise or something like that, because the music, that's what he said, and I told him I wasn't playin' no music, I was playin' a joyful noise, and that's what the bible says. It says make a joyful noise to the Lord. ("Organ Solo" by Sun Ra) I myself am rising up above what they call liberty, and what they call equality, and whatever man thinks is the greatest thing, I have to rise above that, because I have to judge a tree by the fruit. I don't like what I see, I don't want to be a part of it. I'm not looking for liberty, I'm not looking for equality, I am movin' forward with my music, universal language, expressin' things of value, and if that some people want to listen, they're welcome. I'm just like the birds, they sing. Those who like it, can listen, and those who don't, don't have to. - You know it's follow the leader. There's not too many people that do that anymore except children, there you know, in games. I think everybody remembers the games that they played as children, follow the leaders, you know. The one that made the best leader was the one that did the most outlandish thing, or the thing that was not normal, or the thing that wasn't common, or the thing that was the most, like a pilgrim like thing you know, they went to new frontiers, or they did something that no one else thought to do. ♪ You people of planet Earth ♪ ♪ You people of planet Earth ♪ ♪ You on the spaceship Earth ♪ ♪ You on the spaceship Earth ♪ ♪ Destination unknown ♪ ♪ Destination unknown ♪ ("Spaceship Earth (Destination Unknown)" by Sun Ra) - That's what leadership is about. If you've got a natural leader, and that's what Sun Ra is to me, a natural leader, then whatever he says I don't really think about it, I just react, and you know, do what I'm told to do. That way I've done an incredible amount of things that I don't know about you know. Like building the drum, I don't know anything about drums for real, I mean you know, on a conscious level of saying I'm a drum builder. - Leaders are not included in the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution, this is a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. Left leaders out, of course when you make a declaration of government, that's what it becomes. So this government is one side, it's a government of the people, for the people, and by the people, and it has no place for leaders. That's why I don't consider myself as part of it, because it hadn't anything for me. Anytime you set up a government just for the people, and leave leaders out, it's most certain is the worst type of discrimination. You still got a man head of the Ku Klux Klan, sayin' that the black people haven't contributed as much to western civilization as the horse. So actually since I don't consider myself as one of the humans, I'm a spiritual being myself, I'm sure I can contribute more than the horse. To any kind of person, because they're all here today and gone tomorrow anyway, and you might say that no man is contributing anything to anything. He doesn't stay here very long you know, and then he's headed out somewhere else where he has no power. I feel that the men on this planet would be honest with themselves, they would see that they have no power whatsoever. To get involved in a type of situation of a time zone, or a generation of country, any sort of thing that would make a man think that he is, you might say God, the kind that has absolute authority is foolin' oneself. I know mine myself, would never want to be God, or even like God, because God got all these human beings on this planet, and I most certainly wouldn't want to be responsible for them, or even have the disgrace that I've made them. (avant-garde jazz) I tried to bypass this planet, because the people here are not really spiritual, and I'm a spiritual being, so I've tried very hard to bypass it. I think I'm going to fail, because I think some people on this planet are going to wake up to realize that it's the unknown that they need to know, in order to survive.

A catalyst changes everything, but it remains unchanged. I've been called that, the Baroness Rothschild says that I'm a catalyst, so if you get one person on the planet that you are something, you've got something to work with, so it's two of us say that I'm a catalyst. I am lookin' for people to make judgment day a reality, and to realize that neither God or anybody else is going to judge humanity, they have to do the judging as to what is proper for them to survive. Now they can judge whether I'm really tellin' a lie, or whether I'm tellin' the truth. If I'm tellin' a lie, they have to judge whether the lie is both profitable to them, then the truth that they know. So therefore I'm paving the way for humanity to recognize the myth, and become part of my mythocracy, instead of that theocracies and that democracies, and any other 'ocracies they got. They can become part of the magic myth, the magic touch of the mythocracy, because everything that is unknown is part of the myth, and I'm sure that the myth can do more for humanity than anything they ever dreamed is possible. ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ ♪ We travel the spaceways ♪ - They say that history repeats itself.
