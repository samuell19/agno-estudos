Are you all ready? -Ready! Let's go. Be careful, okay? Sure, don't worry. You should leave the offering here. Bondan! Bondan! Finally, we can have a holiday. What are you planning to do? I'm going to give my brain a hiatus. It's about to explode! Doni! Andi! Maybe I'm planning to do my work. -Doni! Andi! Doni! Andi! Wait for me! -Here, let me give you a hand. What's wrong with you two? I was carrying those all by myself! Sorry, Din. What took you so long? Hey, watch the hair, man! Are you bringing all of your stuff with you? We are going back to our home town. I need to bring a lot of stuff. Right, Andi? -Of course. Good boy! You siblings are always fighting with each other. Hey, there better not be scratch on my little sister. Relax, of course not. Dinda, can you hold this? Just put it over there. -Right. Hold on a second. -Here, just put in front. Ready? -Let's go! Alright, first in queue. Right, just put it there. Okay. -Back up a little. Now, turn around. That's good enough. It will be done on Friday, okay? Alright, third in queue. Come in. Can you please check my bike? I think there's something... ...wrong with the throttle. -Okay, let me check it first. Hello, Doni? Where are you now? I'm already drinking coffee with the rest. You guys are already drinking coffee? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Well, my cell phone battery was dead. All right, just meet us here at our usual place. Okay, I'm on my way right now. I just need to close my shop. Here, I brought you a cheese cake. Why don't you try some? What kind of a cake? No. Just try it. -No! I don't want to. Here, open your mouth. -No, don't force me! This won't make you fat, honey. Just have some. What is this? -Come on, just try it. How romantic! Can I have some too? Where have you been? What took you so long? You seem very cheerful. -Sorry, I'm late. Hey, do you guys want to hear something? This was what happened. I met a very beautiful girl. Since when do you have the guts to talk to a girl? Girls aren't attracted to nerds like you. Hey, that's not true. Right, Riko? So, you guys don't believe me? In fact, it was the girl who talked to me first. If you don't believe me, just smell her perfume. Here. It smells like a corpse. Maybe you were talking to a ghost! No way! This is the smell of a famous perfume. By the way, why don't you tell us from the beginning? You called and told me to come here. Then after I closed my shop..... You're Riko, right? -How do you know my name? You're the owner of this tailor shop, aren't you? Yes, that's me. Sinta. What's wrong? Why is your hand very cold, like..... Maybe because I stayed too long in an air conditioned room. Right, no wonder it's so cold. -You can make a night gown? Yes, of course I can. -When is it going to be ready? Maybe about ten days, because I have a lot of..... Can you finish it sooner? How about seven days, a week? I need to wear it this weekend. Can you help me? You can do it, right? Please. Okay, no problem. If you can't do it, I'll just look for another tailor. Wait! I can finish it in three days. What do you say? Three days. I promise, okay? Okay. Can you do the measuring right now? Okay. Then you should take it off. Take it off? What do you mean? I mean, take off your blazer so I can look at your body. Okay, now please turn around. All right, that will do. So, when are you going to measure me? I don't need to measure you. I've memorized all the curves. I'm impressed. All right then, I will finish it in three days. By the way, Sinta. Where do you live? Not around here. She told me, she doesn't live around here. You should've forced her to tell you where she lives. Otherwise, you should've asked for her number. Well, I didn't have time... ...because you called again, right? And then..... Excuse me, hold on a second. Hey, what's the matter with you? -Sorry, man. We are all waiting for you here! Be a little more patient. I was just closing my shop. All right, hurry up! -Okay, wait for me. Ma'am? Excuse me. The pretty girl who was talking to me,... ...did you see where she went? -No, I didn't. The only pretty girl around here tonight is me. Give me some money. Quickly. Here you go. -Thank you. I am absolutely sure that girl must be a ghost... ...who is wandering around in our neighbourhood lately. Yes, he has a point, Riko. They say that the ghost usually abducts and murders men. After that, she only leaves a pool of their blood. That's nonsense. You think I was playing... ...Ouija Board or something? That's it, I'm out of here. Where are you going, Riko? -I'm going to see Sinta. Come on, you just got here. Riko! Riko! You're not allowed to get close to Dinda! Ouch! Andi, don't do that to Riko! Take that, you! -Push the bike! Are you okay? -Yes, I am. I believe, when you love someone... ...you only need to give your heart... ...without expecting anything more than... ...whatever we have given. Sorry if I startled you. -It's okay. Maybe I was just really listening to my music. I think there's something wrong with you. You should see a shrink. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just very lucky to be able to meet such... ...a beautiful woman like you. I'm also lucky to be able to meet a very nice man like you. Sinta. I think I want to see you more often, but how can I do that? What do you mean? -Can I have your number? Cell phone number? -Yes, cell phone. I never use a cell phone. You don't have one in this era? -As a matter of fact, I don't. Then, if I want to see you we need to use telepathy? Just imagine that you want to see me. I will surely come for you. -All right. I think it's getting dark here. -It's okay. I like the darkness. Are you blind or something? Oh my God! -Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? -You're so reckless, Boim. What's the matter with you? You almost hit Doni! -Sorry. When I push the breaks, the bike became faster. Maybe you pushed the throttle instead. Oh my God. Hold on a second. What are you guys doing... ...at this hour? -Just hanging out line teenagers. We're not like you, a forty-year-old-virgin. I'm warning you guys to be careful. Lately there is a ghost wandering in our neighbourhood. You don't need to try and scare us with that crap. I'm not trying to scare anyone. This is true. The ghost will come after a man who is walking alone. After the ghost murders the target, she will also... ...take the body and only leave behind a pool of blood. Leaving behind a pool of blood? -Yes. What are you talking about? -Suit yourself. If you guys don't believe me, I should leave. Wait, Boim! You should just continue your story and sit right here. Don't go anywhere, okay? Just continue your story. Doni, just shut your mouth. Actually, there are a couple of things that we can do... ...when the ghost attacks us. Like what? -First,... ...do not go out or leave your houses. If you really need to go out of the house,... ...don't leave alone like a lion but leave in packs like wolves. Then the third thing, if you came across the ghost... ...then she will call out your name. Hi, Don or hi, Andi! What are you suppose to do? Immediately take off your shoes or your sandals... ...and then you kiss it, put it on your cheeks and..... Run! -Don't run. Just keep walking. -Okay. When you keep walking, she will call you out once... ...again but in a more passionate way. Then what are you going to do? Just keep on walking? -Yes,... ...but then she will call you out for the third time. Then just keep walking. -That's not possible. Nobody can resist when she calls you out... ...for the third time. You won't be able to get away from her. By the time you turn around, you will be dead. I'm sure there's a way to deal with it. Of course there is. There's a fourth way. The most important thing is... ...if you want to be free from the clutches of that ghost..... Hello? -Hello! Yes, honey? -Where are you? Sorry, honey. I'll be right there. Hurry up and come home! -Yes. Come home now! -Yes, honey. If you don't, you're sleeping outside! I'm on my way right now. I'll go there by drone. Boim, wait a minute! You haven't told us... ...the fourth way. -The fourth? Later! I need to go and see my wife now. Andi, you're taking Dinda home, right? Of course I am. Are you going somewhere? You guys go on ahead. I'm going to sleep at... ...Sandi's place. -What? Come on, don't do that. Didn't you hear what Boim told us? What's the matter with you? Hey, everything that Boim told us are all just superstitions. I don't believe any of it! I'll be going now. Take care of my little sister. Of course. -Doni! Be careful. You piece of junk! This is ridiculous. Doni. Doni. Doni. Immediately take off your shoes or your sandals..... Doni. Doni. Doni. Just keep walking. Doni. Doni. By the time you turn around,... ...you will be dead. Are you day dreaming? Andi, who are you with? -I am here alone. I'll bet you're thinking about that girl, aren't you? No, I'm not. But she was just here a moment ago, measuring her dress. Really? -Yes. By the way, you rarely come here in the afternoon. What's the matter? -Nothing. I just want to ask you, have you seen Doni? Dinda told me he didn't come home last night. Didn't you go out together last night? Yes, but we part ways afterwards. He left by himself. He told us, he was going to Sandi's place, his girlfriend. Then you should've asked her. Why are you asking me? I've already called her. She told me, Doni never... ...showed up at her house and they didn't arrange to meet up. Where did he go? I'm worried if Boim's story turns out to be true. What did he tell you? -He told us... ...that recently in our neighbourhood... ...there is a ghost wandering around every night and she... ...likes to go after men who is walking alone. Really? -That's why Dinda and I... ...are worried. -Have you tried calling him? Yes, I have! I called and texted but his phone is not active. So, where were you last night? I went out with Sinta to the lake. What? Are you crazy? That place is haunted, you know? Well, she wanted to go there. Then, where did you go afterwards? Well, I went home. She suddenly left and I don't where she went. How come? She just vanished all of a sudden. I've looked for her everywhere, but she's gone. You didn't call her? -She doesn't have a cell phone. That's weird. Not having a cell phone in this era? By the way what time did she leave? If I'm not mistaken, around 12 midnight. What? Doni also left around 12. Perhaps..... Riko! Riko! Sorry, I didn't hear you. What are you listening to? You seem to enjoy it. Usually, I listen to jazz or blues... ...but now, I'm listening to a romantic love song. What is it? I just really admire you. Why is that? Whether you wear sun glasses or not... ...you still look very beautiful. Sinta. If I want to take you out to dinner tonight,... ...are you going to say yes? -I'm on a diet right now. What if I take you to my favourite place? Do you want to? -Sure. Then..... Then where did Doni go? I'm really worried about him, Andi. After listening to Boim's story I'm afraid that... ...something might happened to Doni. Yes, I'm also worried about Riko. Why worried about Riko? -He always goes out alone. Isn't he always with..... What's that girl's name again? With that girl called Sinta? -That's the point. I suspect that perhaps this girl is a ghost. Come on, stop this nonsense! -I'm telling you, Dinda! According to Riko, she always appeared out of thin air. Then, when she leaves, she just disappeared. Really? By the way, there's one more thing. This girl... ...when she wants to meet him, she always picks a dark and... ...quiet place. How did you find this place? I'm also wondering... ...why do you like places like this? It's because this place is dark and nobody comes here. That's a nice jacket. Where did you get it? -I designed and made it myself. It's good enough to keep me warm. When is my dress going to be ready? Actually, I want to tell you something. What is it? I think I have to measure your body one more time. Didn't you say that you have memorized... ...all the curves of my body? -Well, yes but I'm also confused. When I'm around you I suddenly forgot everything. I'm sorry. -It's okay. You can measure me right now. -Yes, but I didn't bring... ...my measuring tape. But you are capable of doing it without any measuring tape. Isn't that your talent? -Well, yes but... ...am I allowed to touch your body? You can do anything you want. -Are you serious? I'll start from your legs, okay? Close your eyes. Sinta! Sinta! Look, there he is! Sorry if I'm late. Oh my God, Riko! Where have you been? We were worried and thought you went missing too like Doni. You have to be careful, Riko. Because I'm very certain... ...that your little girlfriend is definitely a ghost. Otherwise, she is the child of a ghost. What's wrong? Why do you look so tense? Besides, where were you anyway? You didn't answer my calls. I went out with Sinta to the forest in the suburbs. Are you crazy? I don't even know anymore. It seems that without realizing it, I keep following... ...her every wish. Then, when I was in the middle... ...of the forest, it was really terrifying. Especially, when I lost her tracks. What do you mean, lost her tracks? She suddenly disappeared just like that. Can you imagine that? That girl is a wandering spirit, Riko. According to Boim's story, you should've avoided her. Boim! What's the matter with you? Now it's spilled all over me. -What? What's the matter with you, Boim? -You should've blocked the glass. You're such a weirdo. I have an important information. Extremely important. An information about your brother. Are you serious? -Yes, I am. What is it? -So.... ...I happen to see Doni's bike. It was on a side road near a warehouse. Are you serious? Do you know where it is? -No, I don't,... ...but if Dinda is the one who's asking, I know the place. Come on, Boim! Do you know or not? -I know. Do you know where it is? -No, I don't. So, do you know or not? -I know. Then let's hurry up and go there! He knows the place. -Hurry up! What are you doing? Why are you stopping, Boim? Which road do we take? -Why are you asking me? We go right, straight or up the hill? You said that you know the way. Do you really know the way? -Yes, I do,... ...but it's very dark here, just like my future. This bike has a headlight. Just go already! What are you afraid of? Are you sure? -Yes! Look. Isn't that Doni's bike? One, two, three. You need to slide the door, Boim! Don't push it. -Just stand here and do nothing! Come on. One, two, three. The door won't budge. I think it's locked. Then how can we get inside? -Is the door stuck? The door is locked, Boim. Let's just try to find another way. Let's go. -Is there a back door? Listen, we should all just go home right now. Go home? -We need to find Doni! Yes, but this place is very creepy. There are a lot of ghosts here. Let's just leave him here. -Just stay here by yourself! Riko! Andi! Are you guys really leaving me behind? Dinda, honey. Where are you guys? I told you guys, there's something here. I'm very certain. There's an evil presence here. Hello? That's enough! Stop fooling around! Boim is the one who's always fooling around. I wasn't fooling around. They're the ones who startled me. What's the matter with you? Why are you such a wuss? Okay, that's enough. Let's keep searching for Doni. Hey, we should go home. We can't go home. -What's the matter with you? I've already searched that place. There's nothing there. Let's look over there. -Sure. Stop fooling around, Boim! Come on, let's go! Is that blood, Riko? This is blood. It's blood indeed. Come on. Let's follow the blood trail. It's going there. That can't be strawberries, right? Hey, this is serious! Andi, I need a flash light. The trail leads over there, right? Doni! Doni! Doni! We used to... ...share every laughter together and also play together. We always do everything together. And now... ...all of that has turned into dust and blown away by memories. Memories that can never be repeated again. Now... ...I can only pray for you. I hope you are happy up there... ...along with the angels in heaven... ...who are keeping you warm as they embrace you with... ...their wings. Giving you their love and care. The same love and care that I gave to you. I'm very certain that girl is the child of a ghost. Not an Anaconda... ...because she always takes you to a dark and quiet place. Has she ever taken you to a crowded place... ...in broad daylight, like on a Car Free Day event? But I have met her once in broad daylight. Perhaps so, but I'll bet she's wearing dark sunglasses... ...because ghosts will never dare to stare at the sun. Did you see her feet touch the ground? There's one more thing that you must know. Ghosts will never land their feet on the ground... ...because they don't wear shoes. When you were with her, did you happen to pay... ...attention to her feet? I didn't really pay attention to it. I was too focused on her pretty face. Don't let her catch you off guard just because... ...she has a pretty face. That's just editing work. I'm warning you not to meet up with her during the night. Especially, if you're alone. Understand? Come on, Riko. I am a paranormal, you know? Riko, where are you going? I have to go. I need to deliver her dress. What's wrong? Did I startled you? Please! Please don't kill me! Please! Please, don't kill me! Riko? Hey! Who is going to kill you? What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. It's nothing. Riko, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. Is that my dress and is it ready? -Yes, your dress is ready now. Just take a look at it. Is there something wrong? -No, there isn't. How about if we go out tonight? Go out? I want to take you to another favourite place of mine. I think I'll just stay here. I feel more comfortable here. This place is beautiful. -All right. Sinta. Do you believe in ghosts? Actually... ...I have one more question that I want to ask you. Are you... ...related to any ghosts? Sinta, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I didn't mean anything. Please excuse me for a second. Can you see the girl over there? A girl? I've been sitting here all day, but I haven't seen any girl. Sinta! Sinta! Sinta. Sinta! Sinta! Andi. Andi. Immediately take off your shoes or your sandals. Andi. Don't run. Andi. Andi. Andi. Andi. Andi. Hey, stop day dreaming. Dinda. Who are you with? Where is Andi? Actually, I came here to look for him. Isn't he here? Why are you looking for him here? Well, I've tried contacting him all day, but still... ...no word from him. I'm worried about him. That's so sweet! You're really worried about him. It's not like that. He called me last night. Then, when I picked up my phone... ...there was an old woman's voice. Like a woman with hoarseness. I thought it was the wrong number. Since I was sleepy,... ...I hung up the phone. -And then? Then, I called him back, but still no word from him. What should I do? Just relax. Maybe he's still sleeping. No, Riko. Last night he went home alone. I asked him to sleep over, but he refused. Sleep over? Yes. What I meant by that is... ...that he can sleep in Doni's room because it's empty. I'm being serious! Well... ...what should we do now? Let's see. This is Andi's glasses, Riko. I told you. Every men shouldn't leave the house alone. But now? It's proven, right? But why is that ghost after men? My spiritual teacher once told me that the ghost... ...is seeking revenge, because she was viciously... ...murdered by two men. But why is the ghost after Doni and Andi? It doesn't make any sense. According to my clairvoyance... ...Doni and Andi are both men. You don't need to be clairvoyant to see that. But I still wonder... ...who exactly was that woman who has been murdered? My spiritual teacher once told me that... ...the woman was actually very beautiful. She became a conquest between two best friends... ...who were competing to propose her. However... ...she decided to marry another man and lived a happy life... ...together with her son. Meanwhile, the two best friends who were competing for her... ...held a big grudge against her. And then... ...they both killed that woman? Yes, but I don't know what happened next because... ...my teacher only told me that much. But there's still one thing that I'm curious about. Where does the ghost keep Doni's and Andi's body? All right then. Let's just ask your... ...spiritual teacher, Boim. So, what you both heard from Boim is true. Even though, those two men were married... ...and had their own families... ...but still... ...they held a grudge deep inside their hearts. They held a grudge against that woman... ...and finally... ...they viciously and savagely murdered that woman! Honey, please take our baby. Honey, wait! Honey! Help! Fire! Yan, what's going on? Ki, Hesti's house is on fire! On fire? -That's right. All right then, I'm off to tell the other residents. Come on, let's hurry! -Fire! Fire! Then? What happened to her husband and her child? The husband or the father of that child... ...eventually died, he passed away... ...with a burnt injury on his back. He was burnt. On his back, Ki? -Yes, on his back. About that child, they said the baby survived... ...but I don't know where the child is now. Then if that's the case... ...what happened to my brother Doni and Andi? And if it's true that they were murdered... ...then where are their bodies? Well... ...I haven't got the answer to that yet.... ...but you can find the answer to that question. You must go to the old fort. Yes. In the old fort, there are many wandering spirits. Excuse me, Ki Barja. Is there a way to deal with that ghost? Well, there is. By using this dagger... ...you can defeat that ghost. Can we kill a ghost, Ki? Of course not. At least you can make her go away. Banish her. Only if you can find... ...her braided hair... ...and cut it off with this dagger. Hold on. Do ghosts have braided hairs? -Yes, they do. Among her lush black hair, you must find... ...a thin hair that has been braided,... ...and then cut it with this dagger. If you wish to go there, bring this dagger. Here. Take it. -I will take this, Ki. Ki, where exactly is this old fort? Ask Boim. He knows where it is. Boim! Do you really know where it is? I only know how to love you. Come on, Boim. Be serious! This is no time for jokes. Honestly, I don't remember it too well. Then you should try to remember it and then takes us there. What's the matter with you? Stop touching me! I'm scared! Then what should I touch? Just touch your head! Boim, do we turn left or right? Do we turn left or right? Why are you asking me? Boim, stop fooling around! Do we turn left or right? We go straight. Can you be serious for just one second? Come on, I'm serious! Left or right? According to the image of the sky, we must turn right. Are you serious? -Yes, I am. It's your fault if we get lost. We might end up on a graveyard. Slow down. Just shut up and trust me on this. Slow down! Slow down! -Riko! Useless motorcycle! -Boim, are you okay? Am I okay? You're the one that made us crash! Well, sorry about that. Thank God I still have two hands, two legs and one head. Don't just pray for yourself. You should pray for all us too. This is all your fault! -Well, I'm sorry. Oh my God! -It was an accident. Come on, let's go! Stop whining! -Hurry up, Boim! Don't touch me! I want Dinda to help me up. Suit yourself. -I can't do it alone! Help me, Riko! Stop acting like a baby! Just get up on your own! I'm not strong enough. Even your hands are really heavy. Come on, let's go! Let's go. Come on, it's getting late! -I feel pain all over my body! Useless motorcycle! Does the bike still work? I have an idea. Let's just walk our way there. This is all because Riko was riding that bike very recklessly. If we didn't crash, we wouldn't have to walk... ...like this! My legs are killing me and my clothes are all dirty! Stop it, Boim! Why do keep blaming me? That's a fact! If you rode that bike carefully, we should've arrived by now. Not walking like this. -Boim! What's wrong with you? Why do keep whining about that? I'm sorry, Dinda. You should take a look at the road. If I have chills running down my spine... ...that means we're near. Look. There it is. Over there. Come on, let's get to the front door. Is this the place? -Yes. Come on, stay close. -Let's go, Riko. I'm also scared, you know? Why does this place gives me the creeps? Well, this is how it is. It's really dark inside. We can't go in there. This is a ghost house. If you want a bright house,... ...go to Rumah Uya. Hold on. Boim, you often smoke, right? Do you carry a lighter? I don't carry it but I have one in my pocket. Oh my God. -That's the same thing. Come on, give it to me. Hurry! -Light it up. It works! -Nice. Let's try to go inside. -Are you serious? Of course. We've come this far. We can't back out now. Alright then, come on. -Hello? Stop pulling my arm! Stop pulling my arm! Boim! Stop pulling my arm! That bird was very scary! It almost hit my head. That was just a small bird. Why did you have to pull my arm? No way, that bird was small! That was a demon bird! My bird is the one that's small. Boim, stop joking around all the time please. Do you think it's clear now? We should just go home. Stop saying that! We've already came this far. Riko! Don't go inside, Riko. According to my clairvoyance... ...that bird is still flying around inside. I think it's gone, Boim. Let's just go inside. Are you sure? -Yes, Dinda. Come on. -Alright, let's go inside. Let's go. Boim, hurry up and go inside! All right, just stay out here by yourself. Riko, don't rush. Riko! -Run! Miss Sinta? How are you? -I'm fine. Hold on. Where should we go now? This is a dead end. Are we lost inside the fort? Boim, where are we anyway? Let's look around. Where should we go now? It's definitely a dead end. If this is the case, that means we're trapped here. Dinda! Riko, help me! Dinda! Dinda! -Riko! Boim! Dinda! -What should we do? Dinda! Riko! Boim! Please help me! What should we do, Boim? Dinda! Doni? Andi? Doni! Andi! Doni! Doni! Andi! Doni? Andi? Riko! Riko! Boim! Riko! Boim! What should we do? Where is the dagger from Ki Barja? I'll use it to open the door. Here it is. Get ready. One, two, three! Dinda! Dinda? Dinda, are you okay? Boim, help me out here! Dinda, snap out of it! Dinda! I overheard you talking to those kids this evening. Which reminded me, one of my friends... ...was killed in this area and her body was never found. That's why you are investigating this case very seriously. That's right. -I just told them as it is. I told them based on... ...what I see in my clairvoyance. What do you see? -Well... ...about the ghost who is terrorizing this neighbourhood. She will keep haunting us until she finds the offspring... ...of those two murderers. Are Riko and his friends related to those two murderers? I don't know. I'm not sure... ...because I haven't looked through my clairvoyance,... ...but what is certain, according to the news around us. Both of those murderers have three children,... ...but I don't know if their children are boys. Then... ...how do we stop that ghost from taking vengeance? Only the son of that wandering ghost can stop her. If he truly exists, he would be a teenager by now. A young man. Only he can stop her. How can we find that young man, Ki? No one knows of his whereabouts, including me. I haven't found him yet. But there's one thing. That child has a birth mark. Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Are you cold? Calm down, my baby. Don't cry. My precious. His birth mark is very visible. Only by that birth mark can we identify that child. All right, Ki. Thank you for the information. Right now, they are on their way to the old fort. Perhaps you can help them. I hope so too. Boim, help me! Riko, here's the dagger! Riko! Riko! Riko, take off your shirt! Just take off your shirt! Riko! Are you okay? You? -I came here just in time. Good thing you're still alive. By the way, that was the voice of your biological mother. Who are you exactly? This is my ID tag. It's a long story. I'll explain later. Now we need to get out of here. Come on. Riko. I express my condolences to the death of your friends. Hopefully they will rest in peace up there. Amen. Thank you. Sinta. I'm happy to meet you and able to get to know you. Please visit me often, okay? -Of course.
