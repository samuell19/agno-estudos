Hey, guys, is this too much? Oh, no. Nothing's too much for Christmas. Mmm, I feel exactly the same way, Hem. Oh, Lord, I'm, hopeless. Heh. No, you're not hopeless. Ah, do you-- Do you mind... - ...if I just help a little bit? - Oh, please. - Just a little bit. Okay. - Please. Alright. Ahem. So, what you do is you, you put it deep down inside the tree like that... - Uh-huh. - ...and then you loop it - Kinda like a bow. - Oh. It's gonna almost look like a present when you're done with it. Oh, wow. That's beautiful. Hmm. You're wasting your talent working here. You should be doing interior decorating professionally. Oh, I only do this in my spare time, you know that. Plus, I love Shady Grove. As a board member, I'm thrilled that my director of programming is so concerned. But as your friend, I really hate to see you waste your talent. Look, if a large-scale, full time interior design job became available, would you be interested? What, you mean with you? Well, the Sinclair Family Foundation. My son Nick was really impressed with the job you did on my colonial and he wants to talk to you about doing the family estate. What do you say? Come on, it's a-- Take a meeting. Come on... I'll sleep on it. Okay. Have your people call my people. Ooh! God! Oh, God! Are you--? I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. Are you okay? No, no harm, no foul, no broken candy canes. Well, that's good. Oh, everything is closed around here. Do you know why? It's a business day. Not in Richmond. This is a Christmas tree ceremony. The annual tradition of shutting down the entire town just to plug in a tree. It's a little more than that. You should stay. It's actually pretty magical. You know, I-I can't. Uh, while Richmond might shut down, Hong Kong never sleeps. Besides, I don't believe in magic. Nice running into you, yeah. Bye. Hey, dad. Hey, honey. Hey, bub! Who was that? Oh. Uh, just somebody in need of a little Christmas cheer. Well, you never know, it could've been the Grinch! Is it time yet? Almost, almost. But look, look past. Angels! ♪ Holy night Well, there he goes. Meet you at the tree, Max! Heh, what? I've been your dad for over three decades, and I know that "I got a secret" twinkle in your eye like the back of my hand. What happened? Well, Caroline asked me to decorate the Sinclair estate. That's over in Windsor Hill. Yep. Pretty fancy. Mm-hmm. Job like that could get you written up in a design magazine and you could restart your career. I know. I know, dad, you should see this place. Bones to die for, original architecture, marble floors. But I have a career. You know, I mean, I have a career that affords me time to go home and eat dinner with my son and go to all the school activities. I mean, why would I want to give that up? Do you want me to talk you into this or out of this? I don't know. But I do know that I want to be there for all the important moments in Max's life. Like you and Mom were there for me. You know, that meant a lot to me. And who says you can't do both? But-- No, but nothin'. Take the meeting. Look, Max has a young, very cool grandpa who loves spending time with him. And I'll make sure you don't miss any of the important things, even I have to drag you away from those fancy designs of yours. Anybody ever tell you you're the best dad in the world? I think I got a coffee mug or two that reminds me. ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ Can I see it now? Almost. Three, two, one! Christmas is here! All right, Ham, this little guy is all I could find. Hey, you guys are playin' without me! What's this I hear about a job interview? Hmm. Caroline told you guys? Yeah. Well, you know what, guys, I have not done a job that scale in a long time, so I'm probably not even going to get the offer. I wouldn't worry about it. Don't you go there, Abbey Fuller. Go home and do your homework. Walk in there with confidence. Show 'em your passion. Hey, they'd be lucky to get you. Lucky. Hmm. Mike, what a coincidence! You asked me to meet you here at 2:30. I did? Hmm. You know I forget things. Abbey, uh, this is my grandson, Mike. He still visits me every week, even though he's a big time doctor now. And he loves kids. Well, it's, it's a job requirement. - I work at the children's hospital... - Oh. ...where, uh, fortunately, Granddad, we don't have to put up with this type of scheming and manipulation. Ha. Well, I don't know about that. I have been manipulated by my fair share of scheming children. You should let him take you to coffee. She's off at five. Well, unfortunately, my evening is spoken for by a five-year-old that is just dying for me to get home and help him with a gingerbread house. But, um, it was very nice to meet you. You as well. Here's your tree, Hem. Smooth. Do you think this is goon enough to win the gingerbread contest at Grandpa's cafe? As long as you do your best and have fun, you're the winner where it counts, right there. I know, but the real winner gets a chocolate reindeer. Hey, bub, you know I have that interview tomorrow, right? Yeah? Well, if I get it, you might have to spend a little bit more time at your grandpa's house after school. You okay with that? Uh-huh. I like Grandpa's house. I know you do. But listen to me, If there's ever anything that's really important to you, I'll be there, okay? What about the Christmas pageant? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Nick, don't forget you have an interview in a few minutes. I know, Mom. That's why Kate is here. She has impeccable taste. I know nothing of couches and art. But whoever we hire is going to be working for the family foundation, not Sinclair Enterprises. I know. And I promise you, you and I will make the final decisions, okay? But I would like to have Kate's opinion. I'll get that. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I-I'm Abbey Fuller, the designer. Oh. Well, of course. Nick Sinclair. Hi. Nice to meet you. Abbey! I'm so glad you're here. Nick, why don't we meet you in the ballroom in about five minutes? I'm gonna take Abbey on a little tour of the house. Sure. Come on in. Oh, wow. Carol, I could fit my entire apartment in here. Oh... Ah, thank you. The Sinclair estate belonged to Nick's paternal grandparents. Nick use to love to come here when he was a kid-- he called it, "The Palace." Oh, it's something. Heh. So you can see why we're desperate for your help. And does Nick live here now? Oh, he spent the last decade working in New York, but the business is expanding to the Southeast, so he came home. And now... the pièce de résistance, the ballroom. Thank you. You just be yourself. He's gonna love you as much as I do, thank you. Abbey, this is Senior Vice President of Sinclair Industries South, Kate Newhall. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Hi. I'm excited to discuss how we can bring this house up to its full potential. I can take it from here, mother. Oh. Well, I'll just be in the kitchen then. Please sit. Thanks. So why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself. Um, ahem. Well, I have a BFA in interior design, and, uh... after school, I worked for Tucker & Barber. I grew up with Kit Tucker. Oh. I assume she'll give you a reference? Yeah, she will. Uh, uh... heh, if she remembers me. It's just been a while. I actually took a small hiatus from design when I had my son, yeah. In fact, your mom's how-- um, Caroline's house was my first job back, really. Well, I did do the Haskin's house, uh, about a month ago. It was a small redecorating job. But other than that, my references are... ...a bit dated, but they're solid. As I'm sure you've heard, Sinclair is expanding. And until our offices are finished downtown, we're taking our meetings here. Which is why the first floor is our top priority. Right. And I have taken the liberty, and I've done some mock ups of some potential designs that I think would work well with the history of the home. And I was actually hoping that maybe we could do some seasonal decorating too, if-if we had time. Um, add a little Christmas cheer, heh... What is it with this town and Christmas? It's infectious. Trust me, it's gonna get to you too. You'll need to coordinate with the event planner for the children's hospital fundraiser that we're having here in the ballroom. All the work on the first floor has to be done before the party. Not a problem. And when is the event? It's on the 24th? Christmas Eve? - That's four weeks away. - I'm aware. How big is your team? Well, right now, it's just me, but I do have an excellent assistant on stand by. Well, the first floor needs cosmetic work. Do you have a go-to contractor? - I like David Berry... - In landscaping? Oh, I think the yard guys are pretty good. I mean, they... ...just went out of business last year, so we won't be using them. Um, I will find you someone that will live up to your expectations. No problem. Thank you so much for coming in. If we have any follow up questions, we'll reach out. Uh, okay. Um... Great. I never really had a shot at this, did I? I didn't say that. Your mom wanted to hire me, you didn't, so you thought you'd give me this pity interview, but you were never actually really gonna hire me, were you? I'm sorry... I took a lot of time to prepare for this meeting, time away from my kid. You really want to know what gets me about this whole thing, is that your grandfather, who started this company, he was a mail clerk, working paycheck to paycheck, and now 60 years later, Sinclair Enterprises is this multi-billion dollar company all because of one thing: because a banker took a chance an some scrappy entrepreneur who had a vision, but no actual expertise. And I would've done a really good job for you guys. But you just didn't give me a shot. So have a good day. Ms. Fuller? Abbey, wait! What? You're hired. Uh, I'm what? You're hired. Look, Kate has her doubts. But that's why she's my SVP. I trust her to be tough. I'm sorry, can you just go back to the part where I yelled at you and stormed out and then you hired me? Look, you have a vision and I admire that. And I like your spunk. Thank you. I believe you'll get the job done... even if it takes a Christmas miracle. Well, how'd it go? Got the job. Oh! Well this calls for a victory cookie. You want a snowman or a Christmas tree? Well, I will have the tree. I always feel guilty about biting the head off a snowman. What're you doing, bub? We're making ornaments for the pageant. Yeah, they asked for help, and Max volunteered his family. We love making Christmas decorations, right, Mommy? Uh, this might be a job for just you and me this year, kiddo. No, don't be silly. I will always find time. This is exactly the kind of thing that I promised myself I wouldn't miss. What's the big deal? I mean, how many of these do we gotta do? Two hundred. - What? - Two hundred. Give me a paintbrush. Customers are comin' soon. Rise and shine. Heh. Ready for your first day of school? Mmm, yeah, I'm all packed up. I've got my mock ups, paints, swatches, and basically, I'm Mary Poppins with a measuring tape. Heh. I am so proud of you, Abs. How did I ever raise such a great kid? Solid parenting with a healthy dose of luck. Alright, I got to brush my hair, cull my teeth, change my clothes. Oh! Oh! Um... Yeah. I've got a mansion to decorate. And I get to get Max to school. Oh. Oh. Ha! Thanks, sorry. Thank you. If that's your idea of professional attire, we're in trouble. Oh, well, you know what they say, "Dress for the job you want." Heh. Today the job I want is movin' furniture. The East Wing is our most public space-- meeting spaces, offices and an executive suite. Oh, look at these built-ins. Oh, I love these. Yeah, we get some vintage books, make it look like a... Victorian gentleman's study. Or... we could do something modern. You know, uh, both could work, I think. Just let me know whatever you decide. You're welcome to use any of the furniture you find in the estate. Oh, uh, do I get a separate holiday budget? Or do you want me to include the decorations in with my estimate? Decorations? Well, I just assumed since you were hosting the gala on Christmas Eve, that you would want to make the rest of the place look a little bit more festive in case guests wander. I don't see any harm in going the extra mile. I'll come up with the budget and let the event planner know. This is our office. Nick and I are going to be working here temporarily. - Try not to disturb us. - Of course not. Uh, do you know when I'll be able to set a meeting with Mr. Sinclair to go over designs I have? Nick's working around the clock to launch Sinclair South. If you have any questions, just come ask me. Okay. Well, I understand he's really busy, but, I mean, my job is gonna be almost impossible if I can't talk to him. You said you could handle it. Make it work. Alright, Nick, I'll be back in an hour. Abbey, come in. Ah, sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering if I could schedule some time to sit down with you. I've got three and a half minutes until my next call. Right, okay. I'm all yours. Well, heh, it would just really help me to know some of your likes and dislikes. Well, I like clean lines. Nothing too fussy. No knick-knacks. And here I would've pegged you a knick-knack aficionado. That was a joke. Um... Okay, uh, like anything else? Like your favorite color? I like my furniture sturdy. And none of those old fashion chairs that make me feel like I'm going to break them just by sitting down. Right, so you have preferences. Preferences, and 30 seconds. Look, the more you give me to work with, the better off I'll be able to make this house reflect who you are. Abbey, my mother believes in you and she is a tough critic, so... just do what you do best. You'll be fine. Right. Okay. Thank you. Boo... Mommy! Hey! Muah. I missed you this morning. What are you doin'? We're painting the big set pieces. Oh! Abbey? Hey. What are you doing here? Helping out with my niece. - And who do we have here? - Oh! This is-this is my son, Max. Max, say hello to Dr. Mike. I just went to the doctor and I got a candy cane. You'd better have one. Oh, man. You know... um, what in the... heck? - Let me... - ABBEY - What? - What?! Clean those ears! - What do you say? - Thank you. You're welcome, bud. That was good. That was good. Um... I know my granddad can be kind of-- - Persistent? - I was gonna say overbearing and obvious. So, if you ever wanted to, I don't know, grab dinner, - I eat. - I'll keep that in mind. - Okay. - All right. - All right, we'll see you. - Bye. Well, hello there, Santa. Well, this is a nice surprise. Well, I had my lunch break, so I figured I'd sneak out. In that case... How did it go today? Oh... Well, I've barely seen my client, and it seems I keep getting in the way of his highly efficient SVP, Kate Newhall. What's Nick Sinclair like? He's... imperious. Uh, he's hard to get a hold of. I mean, he acts like I'm just a big nuisance just because I'm trying to do my job. And, dad, I'm telling you, I'm trying to like him because he's Caroline's son, - I really am. - You don't have to like him to get the job done. I know that. I know that there are difficult clients that come with the job. I get that, but, you know, here's the thing, I was really excited about this job. You know, I see so much potential in that place, but I don't know what it is, it's just like, ever since I met Nick... I can't get a feel of what that place should be. I can't imagine trying to turn that giant, cold mansion into a place you'd want to spend Christmas in. Where on earth did you find this? Oh, I asked your mom for an old box of family ornaments. I was nine when I made this. Yeah? I was so proud of myself, too. In my head, I thought I was the next Picasso. Mm, I can't believe you knew who Picasso was. The only artist I knew was Lisa Frank. I was determined to hang my masterpiece from the top of the tree, but I was too little. So my dad just lifted me up like I weighed nothing, and I just hung it right beneath the star. You know, you're different when you talk about your family. - You're softer. - Softer?! Babies and puppy dogs are soft. I am-- You are incredibly busy and very important. Exactly. Right. Right. Well, listen, Mr. Important, if you want my best, you're gonna have to work with me a little bit. You know what I want? I want to not have to think about any of this. I know, but I just need you when it comes to the bigger purchases, you know? Like, I don't wanna buy a blue couch if you don't like blue. Well, I am ambivalent about blue. See? We can do this as painless as possible. I can email you some links for your approval, or, if you get tired of sitting in front of your computer screen all day, we could go shopping on one of your days off. I don't take days off. You don't? Excuse me. Oops. I gotta take this. Sorry. Okay, perfect timing. Abbey still has a few questions. Uh... what is this? Oh, well, I actually think that's a reindeer, but you'd have to ask Nick. When clients arrive for the gala, they need to see somebody formidable. - Important. - Right, okay. So, you would like something a little bit more sleeker. Yeah, I could do that. No problem. Abbey, I want this relationship to work just as badly as you do, but there's a big learning curve. And you said it yourself, you've been out of the game a long time. So, there's no shame in admitting you're in a little over your head. If you wanna step down now, I'll make sure Nick gives you a glowing referral. Um... No, that-that won't be necessary. - Hey, dad. - Hey, kiddo. Just checking in. You gonna make it home in time for dinner? Uh... No, dad. I'll just-- I'll grab something on the way home. It's okay. Mm-hmm. Late night, huh? How's it going up there? Uh, well... Is there a word that means "terrible" but worse? 'Cause that's how this afternoon went. Oh, now, it can't be as bad as all that. Yeah, well, you'd be surprised, dad. I mean, my boss literally just said I was in over my head and, uh... that I should step down. - Nick said that? - No, not-not Nick. Kate. But... ...it doesn't matter. I'm just trying to do the best I can but I don't know how to give him what he wants if he won't give me the time to tell me what he likes. I'm at a complete loss over here, and Kate has made it incredibly clear that I just... I keep making all the wrong choices. I don't know. Maybe bringing in Desiree will help? - Love you. - Love you too. - See you soon. - All right. Bye. Thank you so much. Oh, Des, so glad you're here. Once the movers are done will you check on the painters? - Mm-hmm. Copy that. - Okay. Oh, hey, Nick. Um, I would like for you to meet Desiree. Desiree actually worked for me, what, - you were my intern, like, a million years ago. - Yes. - She'll be my right hand. - Oh, wonderful. Nice to meet you. Glad to have you. - Glad to be here. - Excuse me. - Wha...? - Uh... Uh... So, I spoke to Caroline this morning, and we've decided to put all the furniture in storage, if you're okay with that. I am not attached to any of it. If my mother wants to get rid of it... - get rid of it. - Okay. Or... we could donate it to charity. Make someone's Christmas a little brighter. - That's an excellent idea. - Oh. - I'll reach out to Purple Hearts. - Okay, great. Then, I'm gonna take off on a shopping trip for furniture. Keeping it simple, nothing too fussy. Great, I'll drive. Where are we going? What? Chester Market. Right, Abbey? Yeah. Chester Market. I thought you don't take days off? Well, I'm making a very rare exception today. Because my 2:00 canceled, and, apparently, my interior designer can't make any decisions without my input. So... you've got three hours. Three hours? You act like that's a challenge. I'm a mom. You should be surprised what I can get done in three hours. Come on. Thank you. Whoo. Oh, yeah. Oh. Okay... So... Oh, right here. First stop. Hi. Can we have two, please? - Oh, I'm okay. - No. I am not moving any further until you've had this hot cocoa. - Well, I've had hot cocoa before. - Mm-nmm. You haven't had thishot cocoa. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. I promise you, it's terrific. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm? I told you. I knew you'd love it. Oh, I just love when your stand pops up because it means that Christmas is finally here. Finally? I bet you're one of those people that start playing music before Halloween. Yeah, of course. Come on. Leave our coats so it's easier to shop. Oh! Ohh... Love this. I used to have a nutcracker just like this one. My mom gave it to me. She used to love Christmas. Kinda made a big deal about it. That explains so much. Okay. So, feel free to wander, okay, because there are lots of fantastic things in here. Ooh, I'm not sure "fantastic" is a word I would use. Okay, look. I'm gonna give you a little hint. When antiquing, you need to just reach way down deep inside and pull out what I like to call your romantic spirit, okay? Helps you look at things a little... differently. Like that. It's, uh, missing pieces. Well, if you look at it like that it is. But... if you use your romantic spirit, you will see that this is not just a cup. This cup has been at someone's family Christmas dinner for years and years. Think about all the meals that that family shared. And all of the memories that this one little cup can hold. Uh, I don't think Kate will like to serve dinner on a set of mis-matched china for the gala. Have you always been so Grinch-y, or are you just trying to antagonize me? You and all the Whos in Whoville. What? What's wrong? Did... did you just tell a joke? Yeah, I think that was an actual joke. Oh, Serious Nick Sinclair, he just made a joke! It's a Christmas miracle. Ho-ho-ho! Okay, come on. Furniture's over here. I found it. I love it. No. - I like this one. - I like it, too. - You like it? - I do. And you know what? - Hmm? - It's on sale. This is good. We're making progress. So, we know that you like Scandinavian, you do not like Tuscan, and you feel pretty neutral about the arts and crafts period. I think the key is to use it sparingly. Because there's a fine line between charmingly vintage and 60's vacay in Palm Springs, which is... Which, of course, we could do if you wanted to go full mid-century modern. I... trust your instincts. Thank you. Oh. Ooh. - What? What'd you spot? - Nothing, nothing. It's just, uh, something for another project. - Uh-uh. I know that look. - What look? That's the look I get right before I close a major deal. What-what did you see? Oh. Well, I-- This table. It would make the perfect base for the gingerbread house display for the gala. There's a gingerbread house display? In my fantasy version of the gala there is. Uh... You don't like it? No, no, I love it. I think it's great. You could host Christmas dinners at this table for years to come. I mean, for me, picking out the pieces that fit into your life, it's... It's a real privilege for me and I want you to know I-I take it seriously. - Let's get it. - What? Really? Yeah. I mean, I can't promise that I'll host Christmas dinners for years to come, but I... I could see myself having dinner there and that's... good enough for me. Hey, you're under the mistletoe. : Let's go. Listen, I would love for you to help us plan our Children's Hospital gala. What? Really? Yeah. Well, you clearly love the work. You already have ideas for a gingerbread house display. And, uh, your unbridled passion for Christmas is a perk. As tempting as that may be, I mean, it's gonna be a struggle with what I already have on my plate. I'll double your budget to work with the event planner we've already hired, Walter. He's British, total snob, and you will love him. Well... I mean, the week of the gala, I would have to have at least one more pair of hands. I'll give you two. You're used to people saying "yes" to you, aren't you? Only when I really, really want them to. Okay, uh... Well, then... yes, I will do it. - Good. - ♪ Joy to the world ♪ The Lord is come - I love carolers. - Me too. My dad rented a cottage in Nantucket one year when I was a kid, and he announced to the whole family that we would be celebrating all 12 days of Christmas. - Yeah? - Yeah, and he went all out. He got a real pear tree and everything. Well, I mean, the partridge was fake. - That sounds amazing. - It was. And for 11 pipers piping, he took us to see the Victorian carolers. Even got me a top hat, just like that guy. It was... a long time ago. - Yeah. - Yeah. I just wanted to say-- You first. I just was gonna say thank you. Not just for dropping me off, but for giving me three hours of your undivided attention. Well, I had fun. Mom, I'm hungry and Grandpa won't let me eat. - What? - Uh, no. I said you couldn't have a sugar drop cookie till you finished your dinner. Oh, there's the truth. - Bub, you know the deal. - Hi. I'm Abbey's dad. You must be Nick Sinclair. Nice to meet you, sir. Oh, Phil, please. I'm Max. Max. Nice to meet you. Max, this is Mr. Sinclair. - You're really tall. - This is true. Here. Is that better? Oh. Well... Sorry, he gets shy around, um... tall people, I guess. I get it. I'm usually shy around tall, new people, too. Oh-ho! We got two jokes in one day. Well, I guess I should be going. - Philip, nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. - Max, nice to meet you, too. - Bye. Wonderful. - Good night. - Good night. Where have you been? You missed three calls from Kirk Shipley. My 2:00 canceled. So I went furniture shopping with Abbey. Nick, we're launching in three weeks. You can't just go running off like that. It was only a couple of hours, Kate. Besides, I recruited Abbey to help us with the gala, so it was productive. We should've hired a real firm, not some woman who's obsessed with Christmas that your mother took a liking to. I have Reimann and Champion on standby. - I'm gonna see if they can take over from here. - Kate? I happen to like the Christmas trees. It's a nice touch. Ow! Max... - Hi. - Ms. Abbey Fuller? Yeah. Sign, please. Miss Caroline, you gotta come look at my house! Okay. Hey! - Hi! - Thanks for the invite. See that? Oh, it smells like my childhood in here. Hold on... Did you make that out of gingerbread? - Uh-huh. - Well, that's my Abbey. She never could resist decorating a house. Yeah, it's a bit of a compulsion. Oh, look. They made it. Um... Uh, excuse me, just one minute. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Abbey. Hi. Uh... This is Walter Fabian. He is our event coordinator for the gala. - Nice to meet you. - I know it's the weekend, but since we're all here now, and my weekdays are full enough as it is, Walter and I were hoping to steal you away for a moment - to discuss the gala plans. - Oh, uh... Um... sure. Yeah, yes. Absolutely. Just right this way. Is that figgy pudding? Of course, it's Christmas Eve. Brined turkey, roast goose, and a glazed ham. Because Kate insists that Americans consider "pork" holiday fare. - Well, Kate would be right. - Hmm. - That's perfect. - Well, I do rather have good taste, don't I? You do. Okay, this is what I'm thinking: we keep the table simple. It's all about the food. Gold platters, sprig of holly or two, no linens. We could do those sugar-glazed cranberries in little crystal bowls. Give us that winter sparkle. We are going to be great friends, you and I. Yes. Yes, we are. - Um... - Um, Abbey, my dear, thank you for your time and talent. I'll get started on these ideas right away, and we can pick up it on Monday. - Thanks again, Walter. - Mm-hmm. Thank you. Come on. Oh, wow! - Ohh... that's amazing! - Thanks, Mom. - I think we know where he gets it. - Oh, Abbey. - I got a patient here in dire need of your attention. - No! Okay. Ooh... Hey, how you doing? Mike Acosta. Abbey's friend and sometimes gingerbread cookie maimer. Pleasure to meet you. All right, all right. So... here you go. It was touch-and-go there for a little while, but I think he's gonna live. You are a miracle worker. - ABBEY - Amazing. Well, uh... I'm gonna head out. - I'll see you Monday. - O-okay. Bye. Remarkable. It's amazing. I'm gonna actually put it on my mantle. How was your weekend, Kate? It was good. Did you have a productive weekend? Yeah... Yeah. I met with Abbey... and Walter. To discuss the gala details. Hmm. Have you ever made a gingerbread house, Kate? No. Why? No reason. Hi. Jesus, what in the-- are you okay? What are you doing up here? - No. I'm--I... - Oh, goodness. Thank you. I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh, your mom told me there was more Christmas decorations up here so I made the horrible mistake of standing on that chair to try to reach a very promisingly labeled box called "December essentials" which apparently was code for office supplies. Guessing my grandparents moved most of that stuff to the boathouse. - I'll check that later. - Okay. - You're sure you're okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Oh, thank you for the nutcracker. - Oh. - It's really nice. - It was nothing. - No, it wasn't nothing. It was kind and considerate. Hey, I've got a few minutes. I could take you to the boathouse if you like. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, the sky, big storm's coming in. Yeah, it's freezing. I hope it snows. Yeah. You're gonna get your wish. Oh. Come on. Right here. Snow days are only fun if you're a kid, and they call any school off. If you're an adult, that means canceled flights and driveways that need to be shoveled. No. No. No. I disagree. I think snow is fun no matter how inconvenient it is. Of course you would say that. Well, it's the truth. You know, the Christmas before my mom passed, there was this massive snowstorm, it was so amazing, me and my whole family we went outside in the yard and we were building snowmen and we had a snowball fight, it was so much fun. And well that happened to be the last Christmas that we had with her but, you know what made that Christmas so special? It was the snow. Yeah, it was like magic. And, you know, it has not snowed on Christmas Eve since, and I ask it to every year and it doesn't. - Well, for your sake, I hope it snows. - Hmm. For the gala's sake, I hope it doesn't. Here we go. - All right. - Oh, that's cute. This is... What? What is this, is this your dad's? No. Unfortunately my father never did Christmas again after Nantucket. He just got too busy working. This would be my mother. I could totally see her in that. Great Santa's helper. Oh, yeah, you have no idea. Every Christmas Eve she went all out. I mean, she left carrots for the reindeer, cookies for Santa. In the morning they'd be gone and there'd be these soot footprints leading from the fireplace to the tree. Oh, you know. Yeah, it's Kate. I need to take this. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, I've got a few boxes to go through. Yeah. Okay. I should be going. I'm sorry. No, that's fine, thank you. You--are you gonna be okay down here? Yeah, totally. Totally. All right. You know, you're gonna get cold. - Take my jacket. - No. No. No. I'm fine, I'm not even cold. No. No. I don't believe you Here, please take it. Yeah. Thank you. ♪ For the first Noel♪ ♪ The angel did say♪ ♪ Was to certain poor shepherds ♪ I'm pretty good with the scissors. I did say so myself. Show off. So how's work going? Good. Your worry wrinkles is giving you away. Oh, there might have been a moment. What kind of moment? It's like a lingering eye-contact-y kind of moment. Nick and I are looking for Christmas ornaments and the next we're hiding away from the snowstorm in his boathouse enjoying each other's company. Well, that sounds nice. No. It's confusing. I mean, on Monday, he's a distant workaholic and then on Tuesday, he's nice, and thoughtful, and warm, I mean, I don't know which version of Nick I'm decorating for. Well, I'd wager there are two sides of the same person. Of course. He's just being a people person. On the other hand, it's what was it? Lingering eye-contact-y kind of moment, but they're always worth exploring and I would never advise you to get involved with someone you work for but... Well, I mean, technically I don't work for Nick, you know, I work for the foundation. But that's not the point. The point is he's not even my type. Well, your mom would say it's important to find someone who makes you laugh, and who can take care of you, and who will let you take care of them. Yeah. Well, mom had it easy because she found you early on. Abs, you have so much left in your heart to share. Maybe it's time you get back out there. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right, dad. I'll be right back. Dr. Mike? Sorry. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. Listen, do you still eat? I do, yes. Thursday night? Yeah. It's a date, yes. - Okay. - Yeah. - All right. Good. - Okay. - I'll see you then. - I will-- - I will see you then, yes. - Okay. Looking forward to it. Okay, let's see, well, these windows aren't standard so they'll need custom panels. I'll go give them a head's up, let them know we need a rush order. Okay. Thanks. Oh, can you bring me those vintage books? I wanna start dressing the shelves in here. Sure, just tell me where they are. Sorry, I thought you were Des. Yeah, it looks good in here. You made a lot of progress. It still needs a lot of work, but I feel like I'm breathing life back into it. Are you sure? Okay. Okay. I'll let them know, thanks. - What? - Bad news. The painters are coming from Norfolk where the snow's already started coming down and they're not gonna make it today. Are you serious? Okay, well, we've got to get the garland hung up in the ballroom. That's not gonna work. If that's not done by tomorrow afternoon, Walter will be behind. - Ell then I guess we're hanging garlands tonight. - I'm so sorry, thank you. I know crisis management when I see it. Good luck. - Bye. - Thank you. Okay. Listen, Max's Christmas pageant dress rehearsal is tonight and I promised him I would be there. - I have to be there. - Oh, we'll get this done in time. - I'll go get the ladder. - Okay. Thanks, Des. This place is gonna look like a winter wonderland if it sticks around long enough for Christmas. You know what, though, I think that maybe you should get on the road. I don't want you to get stuck here. What? I can't just abandon you here. There's still so much to do. Oh, yeah, you're fine, you know, you go home safely, all right? Of course. Thanks, boss. Hey. All right in here? Hey. Yeah, well, you know, I hate to admit it but I think you were right about the snow bringing more headaches now that we're adults. What's wrong? Max has this Christmas pageant rehearsal tonight and, what, in about an hour and a half and, well, - clearly I'm not gonna make it. - Why don't you go home? I have a schedule and a job to do so I'm gonna do it. Yeah. What are you doing? I'm helping. What? I've never seen you out of a suit jacket. And the final touch, the mistletoe. Got it. It actually feels good having contributed to my own home. Right? Yeah. Thank you so much for helping me. It was not a problem. I'm gonna make it. - Ah. I'm gonna make it. - Yeah. Before you do, you've got a pine needle in your hair. - What? - Yeah. Here. There you go. Oh, thank you. - I should... - Yeah. Get going, yeah, make sure my help wasn't all for naught. Yeah. Thank you again. Yeah. Oh, no. Do you have a snow scraper, shovel, maybe a magic sleigh? I have a car, four-wheel drive in the garage. Come on, I'll give you a lift. Coming to my rescue yet again. Thank you. Places in five minutes. Mom, you made it. Hey, bub, you look perfect. Hey, Max. You remember Mr. Sinclair? He got me here just in time for your rehearsal. Is that for me? Thank you. I--I'm gonna takeoff. What? No. You don't wanna stay for the rehearsal? No, I really should get going, you know, - before Kate puts out an APB on me. - Okay. - Enjoy the show. - All right, bye. Just get to be into... Okay. Christmas lights, I wanna light the entire pathway, if possible. What color preference? Definitely white. - Keep it classy. - Okay, wonderful. Just like your hair today. Uh-hmm. - Abbey has a date tonight. - Oh. And you're wearing that? What's wrong with what I'm wearing? Absolutely nothing. I'm sure it's very comfortable. Well, thank goodness, I was prepared for tonight - and brought backups. - Backups? I know it's been awhile since your last date. Oh. Gorgeous. You don't think it's too much for a first date? Uh, where are you going? - Aurora Borealis. - You're perfect. Have you seen Abbey? I wanted to compliment her on her deck chairs. You just missed her. She was running late for her date. - Date? - It's when two people who are mutually interested sit down over a plate of food. Yes, I know what a date is. That doctor of hers is taking her to Aurora Borealis. Never heard of it. Oh, it's a seasonal pop-up eatery that raises money for the food bank in Christmas. Yes. Well, I'll have to - check that out sometime. - Uh-hmm. - It's beautiful in here. - Yeah, it is. - Hmm. - I used to volunteer with decorating. Yeah. Before I had Max. Nice. Thank you. Oh, I love the violins. Yeah. Hmm. We look forward to getting that email. Thank you, Aaron. Bye. McManus wants to move forward with the merger. Ah! I knew they would. Great job, Kate. Hey, you know what we should do? We should go celebrate over dinner. There's a new restaurant that I just heard all about. - Uh... - Okay. Get your coat. - Let's go. - Okay, okay. Come on, we've earned a break. Thank you. I've always wanted to try this place, but December is just such a busy month. Oh, I'm not surprised. You never take a night off. Yeah. Table for two. Oh, is that Abbey? Is it? Oh, let's go say hi. Oh, thank you. Abbey. Hi. Hi. Hello. I thought you guys were working. We are. It's a working dinner. Oh. Oh, uh, sorry. Mike, you remember Nick Sinclair. - I do. - Mike is a doctor at the Children's Hospital, and this is Kate Newhall, his SVP. - How do you do? - Hi. They're actually hosting the Children's Hospital Gala - at the Sinclair Estate this year. - That's right, yes. Well, we appreciate your support, it makes a big difference. Are you--are you guys waiting for a table? You're more than welcome to join us. - Oh, no. - No, I'll... - I don't think it's necessary. You know what, I think it... We'd love to. - Great. Yeah, grab a chair. - Two chairs, please. Thank you. Dr. Mike. I would love to hear all about where the gala money is going. Yes, of course. Always happy to chat up our big donors. That is why I'll never hire another nurse named "Patience." Occupational hazards. Because it's a good thing Desiree's name isn't "Holly." - Or "Winter?" - Or "Carol." Speaking of Christmas, you should come to the gala. After all, you are heading up one of the trials we're funding. Yeah, I'd love that. I've been dying to see Abbey's latest project. You should see how she transformed the community room at Shady Grove. Oh, I'm sure it's remarkable. Yeah, Abbey is an artist. Well, I'm sure it takes talent. You know, Abbey isn't just picking curtains. She's reading people, learning who they are so she can transform their house into a home. It's a real gift. Thank you. Well, that's nice. I, uh, I happen to think Abbey's pretty special too. How come you have to work on a Saturday? I know working on a Saturday is no fun, is it? And look how big this house is. I've only got 10 days to decorate it. All right, so, this table is here and now we can finally start decorating this room. I got a small tree for the corner, lights for the windows. I'll find them, I think they're in the guest suite. - Okay, awesome. - Thanks. I promise you and I You wanna see what I drew? I absolutely would love to see it. Oh, my God! What is this? - Is this my house? - Yup! And it's got a lot of Christmas trees for Santa. - Max? - And I added a hockey rink so we could skate. That's a great idea. Oh. Okay. Show and tell is over. - I am so sorry. - No, that's okay. We don't mind, do we, Kate? - Hi. - Ms. Caroline! Ooh, there's my favorite friend that I knew would be here today. Abbey, I'm absconding with your son. Oh, no, I-- you don't have to do that. Come on, it's my pleasure. I'm sorry to interrupt, Nick, but can we go? The first band is here. A band? Walter insisted that we have live music. I suggested a DJ but then he looked at me like I just personally fired the little drummer boy. Uh, Kate, I know my timing is bad, but the hospital just called and they need some time-sensitive information about the gala and I'm just not very good with those kind of details. Oh, I'm happy to take care of it. Nick, as long as you're okay evaluating the music? Oh, well, Nick can't possibly hire the band all by himself. Why don't you jump in there, Abbey? Oh, well, I mean, Max... Don't you worry about Max. Max and I have a very special, very secret Christmas mission plan, don't we? All right. Here we go. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way♪ Thank you. We'll be in touch. Well, that was, uh... Excruciating? That was great. If we hire them, I'll get sued for ruining the Christmas gala. Uh, do you guys have any requests? What's your favorite Christmas song? Uh, oh, well, that's easy. Um, can you play, "I'll be home for Christmas?" Good one. Hmm. Oh, I love this one. This is actually my mom's favorite song. Every time it would come on, my dad would just grab her up in his arms, dance with her, it was a bit like this. But it was romantic. Oh, you wanna dance? Okay. So, what's your favorite Christmas song? I'd have to go with "The 12 Days of Christmas." Aww. Because of the carolers of Nantucket? ♪ Christmas Eve...♪ Good memory. Well, how could I forget? I mean, it's the first time I mentioned Christmas and you didn't get all Grinchie on me. Oh, I wasn't that bad. You were so intimidating when I went in for that interview. If I remember correctly, it was you... that yelled at me. Oh, yeah, sorry. - Yeah. - Hmm, sorry about that. But you still hired me. Are you sure you made the right call? No. You might be right, this might be a terrible mistake, call the whole thing off. Not a chance. You're stuck with me. Oh. Great. Oh, I have to go finish the den. Thanks, guys. Bye. You're hired. Oh, my keys. Mr. Sinclair, wanna come see Santa with us? Whoa, you're going all the way to the North Pole? All the way to Market Square. I can't believe you guys are gonna go see Santa without me. You're kidding, right? We have a call with Bob McManus - at 6:00. - Yeah, hey, bub, Mr. Sinclair is busy. He's got to work, all right? I haven't seen Santa in years and he and I have a lot of catching up to do. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna join you. Alright. I'll meet you out at the car. Alright. Okay. What am I supposed to tell the McManus'? The call is just a formality. The deal is as good as done. You know that, Kate. You can handle it solo. This is your opportunity to shine. And I'll just follow up later and iron out all the minutiae. It'll be fine. And what does Abbey Fuller want for Christmas? Well, I would, uh.. ...like for Max to be happy and safe. I would love for this.. ...gala to go off without a hitch. I would like a crystal ball to tell me whether this whole decorating thing is something I should be doing or.. ...I'm just wasting my time. And while I'm wishing for really impossible things, I would like for it to snow on Christmas Eve. Like the, uh, last Christmas you spent with you mom. Yeah. How about you? What does a man that has everything, what does he want for Christmas? Just my two front teeth. And a hippopotamus. No, I'm serious. Really! What do you.. What do you want for Christmas? - So sorry. - No, it's fine. Hi, Kate. What? You're kidding me. Okay, yeah. I-I can be there in.. ...18 minutes. Just buy me some time. Yeah. Okay. Bye. What's wrong? The McManus'. They're calling an emergency meeting. So I have to go. No, that-that's okay. You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - Bye. - Yeah. The McManus' have been chasing me for months and now they're just gonna walk away. I might be the SVP, but.. ...I'm not a Sinclair. They didn't like being passed off. I wasn't passing them off! I was just.. You're right. I should've been on that call. Hey. We still have a horse in this race. We'll turn it around together. It won't happen again. I promise. Hi. I just.. I left some of my fabric swatches here, so.. Thought I'd just come in and see how you are. I'm fine. Thanks. - Ah, Nick-- - Not now. Okay? Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry. Abbey.. ...I'm sorry. I'm not upset with you. I'm upset with me. A deal I'd been working on for.. ...seven months is.. ...crumbling in my hands because I've allowed myself to get distracted. If this merger falls apart, I'll be forced to do lay-offs a week before Christmas. I can't allow myself to be selfish. Not if people's livelihoods on the line. So, I'm.. I'm sorry. I just can't allow.. ...anymore distractions. Okay, I get it. Um, I'm almost done with all the decorating, so I'll just.. ...make sure I stay out of your way. Okay. You're an angel, Jess. Thanks. Okay. You know how Bob McManus is a huge Caps fan? Well, I pulled some strings and got him box seats to the next home game in exchange that he will come to the gala so that you can show him that you're.. ...more than just your father's name. And that you actually care about this merger. And I know, I know it's midnight.. There is cause for celebration. Why don't you look happy? Do you have joy in your life, Kate? Sure. Every time I close on a high-stakes corporate merger. You sound like my dad. I'll take that as a compliment. The gazebo's still waiting on Christmas lights, right? Yes. Groundskeepers promise they'd be up by the end of the day. - Okay. Good. - And I finished staging the bathrooms.. When you smell the chestnut soaps I ordered, you're gonna give me a fat Christmas bonus. You know, I wonder when those two will realise they're perfect for each other. They're both complete workaholics with no sense of humor. Nicks... has a sense of humor. Um, but you're right, they're perfect together. Uh, okay, so we should get started on the study. - Okay. - Yeah. You have to listen to what I have to say! Okay. This is bigger than we could have ever even dreamed. With Carter stepping down, we can acquire PHP as early as next spring. Maybe even February. Hmm. You really do love this stuff, don't you? Of course. Don't you? Yeah, of course. My great great Grandpa? Came to America in 1896. He was English and they invented mistletoe, which you use during Christmas time for kissing. Which is gross. Good job. Good job. Hem! Hey. I missed you. My grandson tells me that you're doing a really great job at the Sinclair place. And we're all real proud.. ...of our Abbey girl. Aww. Thanks, Hem. Alright, come on, gramps. Let's, uh, let Abbey and Philip have a little family time. And we'll see you tomorrow for the gala. - Yeah. - Alright. - Abbey. - Bye, Hem. Worry wrinkle. What's up? Nothing. It's just.. I mean.. ...Mike's perfect. You know? He-he he's got the perfect career. He's got the perfect family. - He likes kids. - Yeah. We get along. But.. But.. But.. ...where's the spark? Hmm. Maybe you left that spark.. ...up at the Sinclair Estate. No. Nick made it very clear that he doesn't have time for sparks. That our relationship is strictly professional, so.. Anyway, after the gala tomorrow.. ...we won't have a relationship at all. The Christmas gala's tomorrow. I'm aware. Thanks. And it's Abbey's last day. Something bothering you, mother? I just don't get it, Nick. You and she were getting along so well, and then all of a sudden.. Pfft. Nothing. Our friendship was taking up time I didn't have to give. I need to keep my priorities straight. Well, maybe your priorities are all wrong. You know, you always pretend as though your father wanted you to follow in his footsteps. And what do you want? I want for you to be happy. I want for you to think about yourself for a change. Think about what makes you happy. I need to get going. I have to do the final walk-through. I can't believe it's the same room. It all looks so great. Thank you. I wanted to restore it to it's original glory. You know, when.. ...when you were a kid.. ...when you used to call it the palace. Yeah, bring it back to being a home. Not just a house. Kind of like.. ...I believe your grandfather would have wanted it. Oh, wow. I mean, you really thought of everything. Mmm. Well, I tried. There is still one more room. This way. And, finally... we have your office. Oh, wow! Impressive! Hm. Is that what I think it is? Uh... You remembered. Incredible. What-- Where did you find all of this stuff? Well, I actually asked your mom if she remembered the name of the carolers from your Christmas on Nantucket. And... she had all of that stuff. So... Do you like it? I love it. Thank you. We should go, Nick. We have drinks with the Phelps in 20. This looks great, Abbey. - Thank you. - Good work. It's wonderful. I'm happy. ♪ O Christmas Tree!

Everyone's dying to know who the Sinclair's decorator is. - You're a hit. - Are you serious? Yes! - I'll go get us some champagne. - Okay! Really? Really, really? Really. You did it, Abbey. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. We did it. And you know what I've been thinking? I think it's time I turned this... decorating job back into a career, and I'm... I need some help. Would you come and work for me, full time? I've been waiting for you to ask! I really hate to toot my own horn, but I was absolutely right... you're a genius. Oh, Caroline, how will I ever thank you for letting me do this? There's nothing to thank me for, you did it all. Hm, you know what, I guess, I... I just need to trust my gut. It's been so long since I've seen my son look that happy. And I don't think it's the Christmas spirit that's giving him that glow. I think you're reading this all wrong. - Am I? - Yes. Yes. I am hopefully getting ready to be swamped with work, and he's... he's got his own business. I mean, it's just... it's not... It's illogical. - Well, love rarely is, you know. - I am not.. Whoa, I know that look, mother. What are you gloating about? I was just complimenting Abbey on her beautiful work, and.. ...I was hoping this event might... clear up some things once and for all. Like, you need to listen to me. Well, you were right, mother. As always. I'll leave you two alone to say fabulous things about me behind my back. Oh, well... She was right. You did a beautiful job. And.. - You look beautiful too. - You look beautiful too. I mean, what.. No, you look handsome. You.. Thank you. Thank you. Would you like to-- Sinclair! There you are. I've been thinking about our branding strategy. Do you have a moment? See you later. Hm... Sure, sure. This is great. What if we were.. Bob, thanks for giving us the chance. I have a feeling this is the beginning of a great partnership. I'm looking forward to the merger. But right now, I'm looking forward to trying some of that figgy pudding. - Yeah. - Excuse me. Ooh, we did it! Great work, boss. Hey, you okay? You seem like you've been on another planet all night. Sorry, I'm just distracted. It's okay. I understand. Tonight was a big night for both of us. We've both had a lot on our minds. Oh... Oh, hey, there, little man. Your house is cool. But it still needs a hockey rink. That's true. But I like it so much better now that your mom made it so nice. My mom is nice. She is, isn't she? They're at the Christmas village! ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright Well... don't look, but he's watching. What? I think it's time to admit.. ...I never really had a chance. Um.. Mike, I'm... I'm sorry. I.. No, no. It's... it's.. It's okay. Honestly, I get it. But, I do believe it's time to make him jealous. I do have my pride, you know. Follow me. Band is keeping the dance floor quite busy, and the atmosphere, thanks to Abbey's decor, is festive. I can't wait to do the final tallies and see how much money we've raised for the children's hospital. Uh. Kate, you are so marvelously competent. Mm. I hope Nick feels the same way. I have a proposal for him tonight that might just change his life. Proposal? I've never been a woman to wait around for something I wanted. - Oh, Abbey? - Hi. I'm so glad to run into you. I.. I'm first to admit I was wrong. You have done a wonderful job with this place. Oh. Well, thank you, Kate. Do you happen to know where Nick is? Uh... Yeah. He.. I think he went to his office. Perfect. Excuse me. If she doesn't hire me to plan the wedding, I'll be furious. - I'm sorry? - Kate's proposing to Nick tonight. - Are you sure? - She's not a woman who waits around for the things she wants. Her words. - We have some things to toast to. -Yes, we do. A lot of that has to do with your hard work, Kate. I wanted to talk to you about our partnership. Okay. I love the work. Do you? Yeah. Of course I do. It's my father's legacy. You're working to live up to something but do you love the journey? Do you enjoy chasing new deals and new clients? Or is there something else? Someone else that you'd rather be chasing? What are you getting at? I have a proposal for you. Make me CFO. Cut back on your hours at the office, and let me do some of the heavy lifting. We can do so much more than just live up to your father's legacy, I want to build upon it. And... you.. You want a different life. A life with Abbey. - Is it that obvious? - Well, at first I was a little frustrated by it because she kept pulling you from our work but then I felt empowered to make decisions on my own. Once more.. I have worked really hard for this company, I deserve a promotion. Done. Really? That was a lot easier than I anticipated. Yeah, well, it was easy because you're right. My father taught me that real leadership meant hiring smart people that we trust. And I couldn't ask for a better partner in this. Just wait, Nick. I'm gonna take us international by next Christmas. I... I have so many ideas. Thanks, Kate. Yeah. - Mike. - Hey, Kate. Couldn't help overhearing. Sounds like you have a lot to celebrate. - Would you like to dance? - As a matter of fact, I would. Mr. Fuller? Have you seen Abbey? - She's gone. - What? Where can I find her? She took Max home. - Okay. - Uh.. A little fatherly advice.. You're gonna need a grand gesture. Is Santa here yet? Hm. Almost, bub. Did you hear that? Hear what? Mr. Sinclair! What? Where's Kate? Probably, celebrating her promotion, I imagine. What is this? This is... a grand gesture. I tried to hire a snow machine, but you'd be surprised how difficult it is to get one to come out on a Christmas Eve. Why are you here? I'm here, Abbey, because... I can't imagine spending Christmas without you. I don't know what to say. Nick, uh... you've helped me to understand what I want out of life and I am really grateful for that. I wanna be a great mom. And I, I wanna be a great designer.. ...but I also want to be a great partner... ...to somebody who is gonna be there for me and Max. I am that someone. And I realize that, uh... I had this all wrong. And that there is so much more to life than just being lost in work. You asked me what I wanted for Christmas. It's you. I wanna be with you, Abbey. Look. I got everything I asked for for Christmas this year.
