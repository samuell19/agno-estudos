Oh, man. Hey, tiger. Hey, hey. Rise and shine. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Good. -Your mom up yet? -No. Don't you guys love each other anymore? Kenny, come here. I love your mom more than anything in the whole world, next to you. Why aren't you coming with us to Aunt Sue's? Well, kiddo, every once in a while, grownups have to spend a little time apart. That doesn't mean they don't love each other. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise you. Here. Dad, I can't get it to work. Hold on a second, kiddo. I'll get it, Kenny. There. Thanks, Mom. Hey, where are you going? Your eggs are gonna get cold. I need to get my shoes. Make sure you're all packed. I made you guys some breakfast. Thanks. You're not eating? No, no, I'm really late for work. So I guess this is it, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Look, why don't you come by the office before you go out of town so I can say goodbye to Kenny? Good morning. Barton and Richards. May I help you? One moment, please. Good morning. Barton and Richards. Would you please hold? Thank you. -Shelly. -Hi. Better hurry. Mr. Barton was through here a few minutes ago, looking for you. Great. Hi. - Hey, big Jim. - Hey. Nice weekend? Well, I'm still breathing. Oh, man, what are we gonna do with you? I don't know. Shoot me. Put me out of my misery. Well, you keep coming in late, and the boss is gonna take care of that. Oh, man, what a lousy market. Yeah, well, maybe we'll get some better news on interest rates. Have you heard? What? Little Saddam got his promotion. Robbins? That slimy parasite? I understand it, though. I mean, he's had the best numbers in the last three quarters. Of course, they keep forgetting that you set the record. Yeah, well, that was last year, Matthew. Around here, that's ancient history. So are you ready for tonight? Tonight? Your blind date, remember? Oh. Look, I'm gonna pass on that. Jim, you need to get laid. I'm still wearing it. Has something changed since yesterday? No, we're still getting separated for the summer. She still wants you to see other people? Yep. Well, then do it. All right, all right. I'll do it. Great. But don't expect anything, okay? Okay. 7:00, okay? Oh, and, Jim... I mean, just in case. It's rough out there, buddy. Can't take any chances. Shit. Leaving so soon? Be right back. I just promised my kid I'd get him a going-away present. Thanks for coming in, Jim. Oh, by the way, congratulations on your promotion. We have turned our backs to God's world, people. We grovel in the stinking, rotten mire of doubt and fear and vanity and self-pity. Look around you, brothers. You, brother, look around you. Paradise. It's spread upon... Well, you know me. Something not too obvious. Oh, that is lovely. It's so beautiful! Wanna try it on? I'd love to try it on. Need some help? Um, no, thanks. I'm just looking around. Think I'll just look around a little bit more. -Okay. -Yeah. Just call me if you need me. Uh, sure. Shoot. Oh, that looks great. I love it. It's so classy. - Very hot. - Hmm. I'm gonna put some clothes on. See anything you like? Um, not really. Ellie, where the hell have you been? I'm sorry, Oliver. I've been looking everywhere for you. I know, but... Look, we've covered this before. It has to stop. I just wanted to buy something that I thought you'd like. What did you get? It's very nice. I was worried. I was afraid there was gonna be trouble again. Oliver, darling, I... I want to show you something else. What? It's my surprise. Well, I hope it's not too much of a surprise. Mr. Barton and Mr. Robbins would like to see you. Thanks, Shelly. "Mr. Robbins," my ass. Afternoon. What's left of it. Sit down, Jim. That's all right, I'll stand. Michael has some concerns that he wants to bring out into the open. He suggested that we three get together and discuss them. Bottom line is, we've been carrying you for almost a year. This company survives on sales, and you're not making any. It's time for you to start producing. You know, I've made a lot of money for this company, and I have done it without raping my clients. That's it. You're on probation. If I don't see results in 30 days, you're gone. Your hands are shaking, Michael. What, are you drinking too much coffee these days? What are you talking about? Michael, let me talk to Jim for a moment. Jim, I'm sorry. He's rough around the edges, but he's brilliant, almost as brilliant as you used to be. He's a cutthroat asshole, Hal. But I need him, and I need you to produce. I can only imagine what you've been going through lately. Yeah, been kind of a weird time for me. I won't stay down long, though. That's all I wanted to hear. Isn't this the absolute greatest? Absolutely. - Thanks. - You got it. Does she have a body or what? Yes, Matthew. She has a body. Yeah! - Hello? - Hello. Who is this? Uh, we sort of met yesterday at the... 82nd Airborne. Right. Oh, thank God. I can't talk now. Um, can you meet me? Are you in trouble? Please. Okay. Where? Santa Monica Pier. I can be there in half an hour. Hi. Hello. Jim Stevens. Ellie. Are you okay? Out here, I'm safe. Safe? What do you mean? That guy at the mall, is he trying to... Would you mind if we walked a bit? Sure. So, um, tell me about yourself. Well, what would you like to know? Who you are. I don't know anything about you. Well, there's not much to tell, really. I sell bonds at Barton and Richards. And what else? I mean, are you married? All the nice guys are married. Yeah. Well, yes and no, actually. Um... I'm going through a separation. What happened? That's a good question. I don't really know. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. Hey, somebody hooked a big one, huh? So, uh, do you always write notes to total strangers? No, I find this rather embarrassing, actually. I'm in deep, dire shit, and I've got no one to turn to. The man I was with, Oliver, he's very dangerous. Our relationship is over, but... He'll do anything, and I actually mean anything, to make sure I don't leave him. Well, what can I do to help? Maybe you should go to the police. What, and tell them that he might do something? I've obviously made a mistake. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Hey! Wait a minute. Jim Stevens. I'm sorry I left that way the other day. I'm glad you called. Are you all right? Um, could we possibly meet? I quite understand if you can't, but... Well, just tell me where. My mother is sick, and Oliver runs a private psychiatric clinic. That's when I first met him, when I brought her to him. He was considered a pioneer. He's quite brilliant. He's also charming and witty and really rather sweet, or rather was, until I moved in with him. Look, why don't you move your mother into a county hospital? It's free, and that way, he can't control you. Because he's threatened me, Jim, hideous things, and I'm terrified. He's crazy. I'm actually frightened of being seen out here. Um... I know someone who works here. Would you mind if we went inside? It's all right by me. Laurel? -Hi, Ellie. -Hello. Uh, this is Jim. -Hello. -Hi. Could we go back? Yes, of course. Thanks. It's this way. We won't be disturbed here. Let me take your coat for you. Tell me something. Why me? Because you look so strong, but you seem so sad. I've been waiting for you for a long time. Mmm. Um... Look, I don't know if I can do this. Um... I'm still married, and I still have... Shh. Jim, I understand. Trust me. Let me show you something. Trust me. It's okay. She can't see you. It's a one-way mirror. She's beautiful, isn't she? You're beautiful. You're so beautiful. I'll take that. Hello? Oliver? It's me. You called. What's the problem? Well, it seems my account is down almost a quarter million dollars. I know. I know. You're down right now. We'll be back up in no time. Save the sales pitch. You made certain guarantees that I expect you to live up to. What are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about. We must have had some kind of miscommunication here. Then perhaps your memory needs refreshing. Either my account starts performing, or the SEC will be crawling all over you. End of discussion. Good night. Have there been any calls for me today? Uh, no. Why? Were you expecting somebody? No, no one in particular. Perhaps the man from the mall? That was a childish thing to do, passing a note to a complete stranger. What do you want from me, Oliver? What I've always wanted, to protect you, care for you. -To protect me? -Uh-huh. You're just controlling me just like everybody else. I'm not trying to control you, Ellie. You watch my every move. You won't let me talk to anyone. You won't even let me answer the phone. That was for your own good. You know that, don't you? Don't you? All right, then. I'm going to take a bath. Fix me a drink. -Take. Take. -Yes! There it is. There it is. -Yes, we're rolling. We're rolling. -Yes! We've got a major market rally. Gotta be a rate cut. It is. The Fed just cut the discount rate! Get on the phone, and get your clients into this market now! Holy shit! -Hello. -Can I help you? Um, yes, I'm looking for Jim Stevens. He just left. He went to get a vasectomy. Well, thank you for sharing. That's okay. He'll be back soon. It doesn't take long. I've seen some great ones in my time, but I swear to you, you've got the greatest walk I've ever seen in my life. I've never seen a walk like that. Really? Oh, hello, stranger. Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm very well, thank you. And your good self? I'm fine. Mind taking a hungry girl to lunch? I'd love to. I see you met my boss. Market's moving. He gets an override on everything we do, so he gets a little nervous when we go to lunch. Well, don't worry. I won't keep him too long. Nice meeting you. I've been thinking a lot about you. Me, too. You might've tried using the phone. Yeah, well, your line is always busy. What's this? Oh, Oliver followed me to the pier and we had a fight. He hit you? I knocked myself. That's all. I bruise very easily. No, he hit you, didn't he? That fucking bastard! Look, Jim, it's really not that bad. Listen, Ellie, you got to get away from this guy. You can't let him control you. I don't want you getting involved, okay? Ellie, listen to me. Just be with me. Ellie... Just be with me. People all over the place. Mmm-hmm. Well, give them a cheap thrill. It's their lucky day. I think you're attractive. Men like you ought to be shot. Oh, my God! Yes, he's back. Jim Stevens is back. Good to be alive, Matthew. Good to be alive. Jim? You wanted to see me? We had a discount-rate cut yesterday. The market moved significantly, and you went to lunch and never came back. -Yeah, well, I was very hungry. -Yeah. You missed a major market opportunity, and you cost this firm money! I ought to fire you on the spot. Yeah, well, you can't 'cause I'm on probation, remember? Is that all you've got to say? Yeah. Fuck you. Jim Stevens. Jim? It's me. What's going on? Oliver had someone follow me yesterday. He slapped me. Are you all right? What did he do? Did he hurt you? No. No. No, no, no. But he said he won't let me see Mummy anymore. All right, listen, I want you to get your things together and get out of there right now. I'm so scared, Jim. Okay. Take down this address, 434 Seaview. It's in Pacific Palisades. It's my house. There's a key under the mat. He made me tell him where you work. I'm sorry, but he's on his way over to you now! What? Okay, don't worry. I'll take care of Oliver. You just get out of there right now. Jim, please be careful. I will. Bye. Reception. Anne, there's an Oliver Moran coming to see me. Would you show him to the conference room, please? Yes, Mr. Stevens. Thank you. We've never been formally introduced. I'm Oliver Moran. Jim Stevens. The note taker. The note receiver. You know, I've been sitting here trying to figure out why she chose you. I mean, it's rather melodramatic, passing a note to a complete stranger. I don't know what was in the note, but I do know you should forget that you ever met this girl. Well, now, I can't imagine why you'd want me to do that. Look, I'm a busy man, and I assume you are, too, but Ellie's a very sick girl who needs my help. She's sick? You're using her mother to control her. That's pathetic. So that's what she told you. And you believed her? But, of course, why wouldn't you? You're a perfect victim for her. Look, uh, do I have to pay for this analysis, or is this like a free house call? On that note, let me give you some free advice that might help you. One, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into, and two, Stevens, you're completely out of your league. And you are wasting your time. You may get hurt. Now, you listen to me. You touch a hair on that girl's head, and you'll wish you'd never met me. If you continue to see her, you will get hurt. You can count on that. Anytime. I'm impressed. So what did he say? He said a lot of things. What kind of things? He's obviously crazy. He's a very persuasive person. Mmm-hmm. I'm sure he is, but he didn't persuade me. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. Ready. Dinner's ready? Good. It's going to get very cold. I like my pasta cold. No, Jim, don't do that. No, it's... Let me see. Let me see. She's beautiful. This your little boy? Yeah. What's his name? It's Kenny. He's adorable. Jim, um, I don't know if this is such a good idea. I mean, this is your home, and it must feel really... Just hold me. Okay. You're incredible. Hey, what's for breakfast? Dinner. Dinner? Um, Jim. Ellie. I think that I should move into a hotel. What's the matter? You don't like the accommodations here? The accommodation's great. Room service is promising. Only promising? I don't want to outstay my welcome. Yeah, well, why don't you let me be the judge of that, okay? So let's see who kept calling last night. Ellie? Ellie? Are you there? Pick up the phone. Ellie, you should come home tonight. I can help you. Surprise, surprise. Ellie, it's been two days. If you think this behavior is of value, I think we should discuss it. Stevens, you should've listened to me. If anything happens to her, I will hold you personally accountable. You can count on it. I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. You're staying right here, okay? Okay. I gotta get ready for work. You just don't care. - Hello. - Hey, there, Shell. -Hey, big Jim. -Hey. Are you bringing the goddess to the cabin? You betcha. Oh, man, I don't think my heart can take it. Well, I'll have the paramedics standing by for you. See you later. -Adios. -Bye. You missed me, asshole! Go fuck yourself! Are you all right, Mr. Stevens? Look out! Are you okay? What the hell was that all about? Okay, Oliver. Okay. Restraining order? You've got to be kidding me! The guy tried to run me down with his car. Isn't that assault with a deadly weapon or something? The problem is, you didn't actually see the guy. You got no license number, right? There's a lot of Mercedes in this town. I told you the guy came to my office. He threatened me. He wants his lady back. Why doesn't she want to go back with him? Because he's a violent son of a bitch. That's why. I understand, but I can't do a hell of a lot more right now. Well, what does the guy have to do? Run me down and drag me down Sepulveda Boulevard? I know how you feel. It's just the way it is. It's the system. You know, if the police aren't gonna do anything, I'm gonna call him myself. Jim, I don't think we should see each other for a while. What? What are you talking about? It's not a game, Jim. This man is capable of anything. Hey, hey, hey. Don't you worry. I can take care of things, all right? I am worried about Mummy. He's not gonna hurt your mother. Ellie, it's me that he's after. Hi. Welcome. Hello, Matthew. Nice to see you. -Nice to see you. Let me take this. -Thank you. -Hi, I'm Suzie. Nice to meet you. -Ellie. -Hi, Jim. -Hi, Suzie, how are you? Good. Oh! Hey, you really sank some dough into this place, Matthew. Hey, man, one life and it's over. You know what I mean? It's so pretty. Well, come see your room. Oh, it's absolutely charming. Yeah, it's great. Why don't we let them get comfortable? Yeah, sure. Hey, listen, don't forget, you guys. Two hours, barbeque. Two hours. Two hours. -Two hours. -Oh, dear. Oh, dear. What are we going to do with ourselves? -Mmm. -Mmm. The mind boggles. Oh, it does indeed. My pleasure. You know what I mean? Oh, well, I'm glad to be told. It's perfect. We need some more buns, I think. I'm telling you, man, those psychiatrists, I mean, you know, most of them are wacko. They're always the worst guys. Yeah, well, this guy's pushed about as far as he's gonna go. That's for sure. Why don't you let me check him out for you, okay? Why not? They keep records on these guys. Yeah, all right. Jim, let me tell you, Ellie is great. I mean, one-in-a-fucking-million great. She's all right, isn't she? She is. - Come on, let's join the men. - All right. I hope you're talking about us. Hmm? -Hello. -Hello. I guess your ears were burning, huh? Well, I'd expect nothing less. -Would you like some ketchup? -My hands are all wet. -Want some salad? -I'd love some. Thank you. What are you thinking? I'm not thinking. I'm appreciating. Come here. And what are you appreciating? -Hmm... -Hmm... Life. I love you. Well, I love you, too. Oh, yeah. La-la-la-la... Hey! How's the water down there? It's great. Great. I'm coming in. Put your suit on. It's only Matthew. Exactly. Come on. Jim! He's your friend. I don't care who it is. What's the big deal? I don't want other men gawking over you. You don't think men notice the way you look? Holy crap! I've got you. I've got you. Hopeless. Absolutely hopeless. See, you have no strategy. You have to think before you move. No, no, no. We are going to bed. -Oh, good night. -Good night. Thank you for a lovely day. Well, I'm glad you had a good time. - Yeah. - It was so enjoyable. Yeah, it's great here. It really is. -We'll see you guys in the morning? -Yeah. Good night. - Not too early, I hope. - Not too early. - Good night. - Good night. All right, let's see what you can do now. I might have lost the battle, but I haven't lost the war. Oh, I can't believe you said that. My move. Okay. My move. Mmm-mmm. Your move. All right. One, two... Uh-uh. My move. -Mmm. -Your move. One, two... And because I won the last game... What? My move. Oh, you're good at this game. I'm great at games. My move. Thanks a lot, man. We really had a great time. Well, listen, you guys are welcome anytime. So why don't you step in my office for a second? What's going on? -I want you to have this. -Oh, no, man, I couldn't... No, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It's not registered. Come on. Do it for me. -All right. -All right. -Thanks. -Okay. All right. No, I don't think it's time to get in yet. The rate cut led to a temporary spike. I don't think the market's bottomed out yet. Right. Well, I'll give you a call when I think it's time. Sure. No problem. What, you got a fucking crystal ball? Did I really just hear that conversation? Apparently, half of it. You just passed up a commission. I just did the right thing. You ought to try it some time. It'd be a new experience for you. Ellie? Ellie? 15255 Seaview. Over. Look, I gotta get some results here. I got someone shooting at me in my own front yard. - My girlfriend's missing. I don't know where she... -Jim. Jim. My God! What's happened? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just... When I came in, you weren't here, and... Darling, what's happened? Right away. Mr. Stevens, I sent somebody to question Dr. Moran. Did you just say, "question" him? Look, I know it's frustrating, but you're just gonna have... What do you think put the holes in that tree out there? Termites? Wait. Don't get smart with me. Now, you get a witness to ID him, and I'll arrest him. Oh, this is unbelievable. What are we supposed to do anyway? Off the record? Defend yourself as best you can. I'll be in touch. I can't believe this! Incredible. Who are you calling? Oliver. Let me talk to him. Hello, this is Dr. Moran. Moran, Jim Stevens here. You're a really lousy shot. What are you talking about? Now, you listen to me, motherfucker. You wanna play rough with me... Excuse me, what are you ranting about? Don't play games with me. This has gone too far! If you calm down, possibly I can help you. Fuck you! All right, for the next few days, I don't want you going out of here without me. I don't want you answering the door. I don't want you answering the phone. Do you understand? Where'd you get this? I have my ways. Robbins lost the good doctor $250,000. How? Excessive trading. Except if you look at the books now, he lost it on four trades. So Robbins churned him, and now he's covering it up. Probably because he was threatened with an SEC action. What about the doctor? He's got bucks like she said, but, Jim, some things just don't wash. Talk to me. There's no clinic. What? He had one, but then he lost his license. -Are you sure? -I'm positive. He works out of his home in Bel Air, some sort of research on some new therapy. Mr. Stevens, Mr. Robbins would like to see you in his office right away. What? Uh, close the door. Barton's on another one of his many vacations. Frankly, I don't think he'd have the guts to do what I'm about to do. What, another lecture on sleaze selling? I don't want you to sell. I want you out of here. All right, could we cut to the punchline? I got a lot of work to do. Not anymore. You're gone. I convinced Barton to fire you. I won. Fuck the probation, and fuck you. Is that it? That's it for you. This makes me very happy. I want you to know that. Well, Michael, I'm happy that you're happy. Tough guy to the end. You're such a pathetic asshole. How a girl like Ellie could let someone like you touch her is beyond me. Now, get out of here before I kick your ass. You can't fire me, asshole, because I know too much about you. You don't know shit. Oh, yeah? What about the Moran account? The one you churned and covered up. You don't want Barton and the SEC to find out about that, then you better stay out of my face. You understand me? Good. We've got our first deal, Robbins, and I'm beginning to like it around here. I think I'll stick around for a while. Have a nice day. Have a nice lunch, Mr. Stevens. Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me! What the fuck are you doing sneaking up on me like that? I'm sorry, darling. I just was looking... What are you doing here, anyway? Well, excuse me for living, Jim. I found this. I thought it might be of some use. It's some sort of trade agreement between Oliver and Robbins. It's a promissory note. Where'd you get this? Found it on Oliver's desk. When I saw Robbins' name was on it, I thought... What were you doing at Oliver's? I was visiting my mother. Oh, really? How is your mother, Ellie? Well, considering I've seen so little of her recently, she's doing fine. Tell me something. Where is your mother? What the fuck are you talking about? She's at the clinic, of course! There is no clinic. Of course there's a clinic! Oliver lost his license a year ago. Yes, so? He works out of the house. So, what, you just give your mother over to a discredited shrink, is that it? Are you cross-examining me, Jim? You lied to me, Ellie. You haven't given me a straight answer to one question I have asked you. I don't have to listen to this garbage! Where's your mother, Ellie? Where's your mother? Will you calm down, and perhaps we can talk? Will you let go of me? We'll settle this right now. I'm gonna go upstairs and call your boyfriend. -Wait! Calm down. Let go of me! -I have a couple of questions for him! Come on! You can't control me, Jim! Yeah, who's controlling who? Get in! Is this the way you treat your wife, you bastard? Leave my wife out of this. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Jim? You okay? I'm just a little stressed out. That's all. So go home. I'll cover for you. Yeah. Shit! Oh, Jim! Jim, I swear... I'm sorry I answered the phone, but Oliver called me... He said if I don't get back to him, he said I'll never see my mummy again! Calm down. Ellie, calm down now, okay? Tell me what's the matter. He said he'd kill her. All right, listen to me. Ellie, listen to me. I want you to go in the house and lock the door, and don't come out for anything. You understand? Okay? -Okay. What are you going to do? -Go on. I'm going to go to Moran's, and I'm going to get your mother. -Now, go inside now! -Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No, listen, wait. Wait. Wait. You need a key. He keeps one... Over the front door, there's a ledge. He keeps a key there. All right. Now, be careful. I love you so much. I love you, too. Go back in. Lock the door, okay? All right. -Go on. -All right. Oh! He has a gun. He has a gun. Um... In... His office drawer, the right-hand drawer, he keeps the gun there. Please be careful, Jim, 'cause he really knows how to use it. I'll be back. Go inside. Go on. Planning on killing me, Mr. Stevens? I assure you, that won't be necessary. Where's Ellie's mother? There's no need to point that thing at me. I'm unarmed. You're a very impulsive man, but if you bear with me a few moments, I'm sure you'll be satisfied that you have nothing to fear from me. Where is she? Ah. Follow me. How much do you really know about Ellie, hmm? For example, did you know that she lost her virginity when she was 14 to her father? What? Ellie has the beginning stages of paranoid schizophrenia. It's a very nasty disease. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. She needs my help, not yours. What a crock of shit! Look, I didn't come here to talk about Ellie. I came here to get her mother, so get her. Ellie's mother died when Ellie was nine years old. Oh, fuck you! You know, you're really trying my patience. Does smoking really bother you that much, Stevens? I thought you were... Lucky for both of us that you're not a very good shot. But I do seem to be losing quite a bit of blood here. In the downstairs bathroom, on the left cabinet, there's a first-aid kit. Could you, please? Oh, and if you'd be so kind. Please. Mmm. Thank you. The left-hand side. Wonderful. Now, what does one drink for an occasion like this? Bourbon or Scotch? Definitely bourbon, a man's drink. Now... Oh, do you... What are you doing? Put the gun down. I mean, I just wounded him. He was okay. I went into the bathroom to get a first-aid kit. Someone else came in and put three bullets in him. What the fuck is going on here? And you don't know where Ellie is? She was supposed to wait for me here. She wasn't supposed to leave the house. Man, I can't believe this is fucking happening. Hello? Hello? I saw you. I saw what you did. Who is this? Who was it? It was him. Who? The guy in the house. The guy who shot Moran. You might like to know, I have your gun. Is it him? Oh, Jesus. Is it him again? He's framing me. Mr. Stevens, I was wondering if I could talk to you about Dr. Oliver Moran. Can we come in? Yeah, sure. What about Dr. Moran? He was murdered. Why do you want to talk to me about that? Yeah, well, you recently filed a complaint against Dr. Moran. Unfortunately, that makes you a suspect. Yeah, uh... You got anything you wanna tell us? No. I mean, I don't know anything about it. Where's your girlfriend? Maybe she can tell us something. She had to go visit some friends. I don't know when she's gonna be back. Go ahead. No, that's okay. I have an answering machine in the kitchen, and it'll pick up. Might be important. Hello? I forgot to mention. I have something else that belongs to you. Yes? I have your girlfriend. Are you with me? I think so, yes. I think we should meet and talk. Come alone, or she dies. Are you still with me? Yes. Yes, I see. Meet me at the old warehouse on Kingsley and Sunset at midnight. Great. That would be good. Thank you. Good news? Yeah. Yeah. Listen, have your girlfriend contact me in the morning. And if you remember anything, I can be reached at this number anytime. Party's over, asshole. Good night, sweetheart. Drop it. Drop the gun. Drop it now. Hello, partner. Robbins? Put your hands behind your head before I blow it off. You fucked with the wrong guy. Where's Ellie? She's in my bed, waiting for me. Fuck you. What have you done with her? You don't get it, do you, asshole? I think I get it. But why kill Moran? Don't play that innocent shit with me. You know, I've never shot anyone before. Put the gun down, Michael. Fuck you, scumbag. Ellie told me what you were gonna do. Ellie didn't tell you shit. She told me you and Oliver were gonna go to Barton and the SEC, take my job. What? Shit! Ellie told me everything. Did you really think a girl like her would stay with a loser like you? Do you know what I'm gonna do after I kill you? I'm gonna go home and take a shower. Then I'm gonna fuck your girl. How do you like that? You followed me to Moran's, didn't you? Ellie never told you shit! She told me that you were gonna tell Barton about me. Bullshit! You're lying! Now, where is she? She's waiting at my home for me. Oh, come on. You don't believe me? Go there. She's there. Oh, you... You asshole. Ellie? Ellie? Ellie? Jim! Oh, are you all right, darling? I'm fine. Tell me something, Ellie. Uh... Why are you here? Jim, I know what this must look like, but would you let me explain? Sure. Go ahead. Michael told me he had your gun, and that he was going to the police. He gave me a very simple ultimatum. Either I come here, or he'd turn you in. That's quite an outfit. What you don't seem to understand is, Jim, I'd do anything to protect you. Why didn't you tell me, Ellie? Because I knew you'd do something stupid like go to the police. Jim, they won't believe you. They'll just throw you in jail. Michael followed you to Oliver's. He saw what you did, Jim. Robbins told me that you told him I was gonna go there. You set me up, Ellie. It seems I underestimated you. Oliver was telling the truth. It was you in the car. You shot at me. Oliver had to die. You weren't man enough to do it, so I took care of it myself. You're insane. That's what Oliver said, and look what happened to him. Put the gun down, Ellie. Give me one good reason why, Jim. You don't wanna kill me. You think you're so special? You're no different from the others. Every time a man fucks me, he wants to control me. I never wanted to control you. Oh, no? "I don't want you answering the phone. I don't want you answering the door. I don't want other men looking at you." You men, you're all the same. You're just pathetic animals that have to have and have and have, be it your wife or your wife's sister or her best friend or even your own daughter. I'm not your father, Ellie. You really believe you're above all this, don't you? But you're just the same as my father, and no one is ever gonna hurt me like that again. Put the gun down, Ellie. I did love fucking you, though. Give me the gun. Ellie, let go. It's over. You know, I wanted so much to trust you. It's over, Ellie. It's all over. I don't think so, Jim. Hmm. Did that hurt, baby? But I did love fucking you. Freeze! No! Let her go! It's over. Let her go. Cuff her. Hey, man, shit happens. Get the wire. Watch his arm. We've got somebody outside to take a look at that for you. You did good. Save me. Save me.
