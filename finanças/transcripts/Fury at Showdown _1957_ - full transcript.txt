(ominous music) - Looking for someone, son? - I've come to fetch my brother. - Yeah. - All right Mitchell, your year's up. - [Mitchell] It didn't seen like more than ten. - You're lucky it wasn't the rope. - It looks like the citizens out there still have ideas. They don't like gunfighters, especially drifters and strangers. We'll take care of them for now. The next time you have to come through this town, don't. All right, give him his gun. Don't put it on till you've got out of town. Wait here. What do you men want? - You know what we want. - You'll have to call it. - Sure, we'll call it, Brock Mitchell. - All right, now you'll listen to me. - Oh, we listen to you what! You'll have your own way when he gunned Frank Wilson, - Wilson was always trouble, he asked for it. - Frank Wilson was one of our boys. - Wilson, forced Mitchell to draw. I know his reputation wanted to prove he was faster than Mitchell. Wilson lost. - Yeah, Wilson lost, because we let you take Mitchell when you promised they'd get justice. - But you've crossed us. Well, we've waited now we'll see who gets justice. - Mitchell's done his years. Under the circumstances that was justice. Now he leaves town, safe. Anybody has any other ideas they come up against me first. - Hi Brock. Brought you the colt. Remember him? - He's grown some. - Move. - Bye sheriff. Sometime I'd like you to be my guest. - Remember, if you ever come through this town here again, I might not be here, but they will. (suspenseful music) - The railroad will be laying new tracks starting next month. Nobody but us and ours ranch, and Riley's out there to supply beef for a couple of thousand workers. - How'd you keep all this going after pop died? - Well, I always figured, I hoped one day you'd be back. Had to have someplace for you to come back to. So Mr. Van Steeden at the bank gave me a loan of 5,000 on our place, and now with the railroad contract, it'll be easy to pay off the bank and plenty leftover. - You're a very great, Trace. - The best. Come on, let's hustle. Norris and Riley are meeting us in town. Phelps, the railroad agent is coming in on the afternoon stage with the contracts. One thing. - Yeah. Chad Deezy is in town. - I thought he had his loggers in Fisco. He came back after you and his brother had the showdown. Now that around that he just wait patiently for you to come back. Please, keep hope, Brock, don't let him push you. - I am to hang onto my skinny chance. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (horses neighing) - Mitchell, I wanna talk you. (suspenseful music) I got word from the sheriff in Buckhorn you were heading this way. Also from every Sheriff's on every town you had pass through from there to here. - It's nice of them to look out for me. - All men look out for each other. I bet time are out of bounds to you, Mitchell. I'm telling you right now I don't like your being here and Showdown Creek. - I don't like you not liking me being here. This is my home. - Got no cause to run you out of town at least not now, but you take one step out of line, I'm gonna make you move. I am to keep this a law abiding town. I'm not gonna let you repeat what you did two years ago, - Sim Deasy drew on me. - Have you made him draw? Maybe there was another reason. - It had nothing to do with your daughter. - Come on. - I said my say. - Yeah, that's how it was, Trace. Everybody believes I gun Sim Deasy, because he was seeing Ginny, even Ginny. That's why I left. - This aint going to be easy, but hold on, just hold on. - Don't worry. I'll hold on. - Glad to see you back home, Brock. - Thank you, Mr. Norris. Glad to be here. Guess Tracy filled you in on the beef deal with the railroad. - I think I'd let you men give him the details. - Stage will be in half an hour we better get right to it. - Now here's the way it cuts, new track road runs nearest power places. Nobody else can handle supply, there will be plenty in the contract for all of us. - The road will want plenty of beef for the men, grading, digging, and laying the track. - And Norris and me will put in the supply joint deal while they're building the 60 miles south of town. - And you and Tracy run the supply for 30 miles north of town. It cuts to 130 each for the 90 mile stretch. - And where there's no cutthroat deals, we don't drive the price up or down, and we'll all get a fair shake of the business. Deal? - What do you say, Brock? - I say I couldn't have made a better deal myself. - Ah, I figured we could settle it friendly, like we used to with your dad. - All right, we're all agreed. Nothing to do now, but sit here and wait for the stage to bring Mr. Phelps. - Is that the railroad agent? - Yeah. We see him together, deal with him together. There'll be no long woven. - No one is gonna try to cut anyone else out. - Never hurts though to have all things understood. Roy, drinks for the boys. - No thanks, Tracy and I have an errand. We'll be back on the stage gets in. - We'll be here. - They didn't mean anything. - Nobody means anything. - You know how they are, old timers, trusting the good book and not much else. Still play poker with two decks and three guns on the table. Anything they said wasn't meant personal. - No, it wasn't meant personal for you. (door shuts) - Welcome home, Brock. - Very glad to see you. - Thank you. - He looks pretty good, doesn't he, Mr. Van Steeden. - Brock, always look good to me. Sit down. Have a cigar, new shipment. - No, thank you, sir. - Half the people I know tell me tobacco is good for the nerves. The other half telling me it's bad. Weight on both side. I guess I know what's worrying you, boys, worrying me a little too. - Trace told me about the loan. It was very kind of you, sir. - Kindness had nothing to do with it. I'm a banker using depositors' money. Your land was good security. Your note comes due in three days. I put it the directors for an extension in case you needed it. The answer was no. I think you'd be able to meet it. - We'll know in about an hour. - Railroad deal? - The agents coming in on the afternoon stage. - Think you'll be able to close the contract? - Well, I hope so, we're pooling with Norris and Riley on the deal. - Smart business. - They're certain we'll have the deal roped and tied. - Even if you're able to reach the agreement with the agent tonight, the contract will have to go to Washington for final signature. Now that'll take time more than you've got to spare. - Well, can you get the bank directors to hold off till the contract is signed? - I'm getting strong opposition to this note, uncommonly strong. Tell you what? Try to get a letter or some sort of written assurance on the deal from the agent. Bring it to me, and I'll personally assume the responsibility to give you the extension. - If anything happens, you will be left holding the bag. You were running that risk? - That's what we're really here for, Brock. We passed by this way only once. We get the chance to run the risk for a different way of future life for a boy we like, we should be grateful to be given that chance to help. Anyway, you've had your fling, I think you'll handle your responsibilities like a man. - Thanks for your confidence. - There is one thing you always should know. Someone's pressing to buy up your note for cash. - Who? - Chad Deasy. He also happens to be on the board of directors, that's the opposition to the extension. Now, you know what you're up against. - Mm-hmm. And you? - I don't like it. I don't like it because I know what's pressing Deasy and it isn't a legitimate business. - You'd like nothing better than to get the whip hand over me. - There's nothing I'd like less than to give it to him. - Even by sticking your own neck out to prevent it? - Like I said, we pass by this way only once. Good luck. - I dunno, Trace. I have a feeling this isn't gonna work. - What are you talking about? - Chad Deasy, he isn't gonna let it rest. He's gonna push to a showdown. One way or another, Deasy is gonna push me to a showdown. - Listen, there's nothing he can do unless you let him. He's no gun, so he isn't gonna force you to draw. There's nothing he can do about our note once the railroad agent gets here, just sit tight. Another couple of hours, we'll be heading back to the ranch. Sit tight. - I heard you were in town, Mitchell. In fact, I heard you were heading this way two days ago, and so I got me an imported bodyguard from the COllins. Meet Miley Sutton. This is Brock Mitchell, and he's got the reputation of being the fastest gun in the territory. He'd rather gunfight than eat, so that's what you may have to come up against. He likes to specialize in killing Deasys. He's already gotten my brother Sim, so watch him. That's what I'm paying you for. - Deasy. - Watch him like you'd watch a Sidewinder. He's just as quick and just as tricky. - I killed Sim in a fair fight. After he'd killed a drunken 20 year old kid he bullied into drawing on him. I've never heard you cry about that kid. - I wasn't his brother. The only thing that matters to me is that Sim was my brother. - Your brother dropped that kid then turned his gun on me for no reason. - No, you yelled, he turned and you shot. You wanted him to turn on you, because of Ginny Clay. - Brock? - The next time he makes a move like that gun him, you hear? You're my body guard, and you've got a right to gun him down like a dog. - Don't ever get between me and a gun again. - I had to. That's Deasy's play from now on to get you to draw against his hired gun. I had to save your skinny chance for you. (peaceful piano music) - You had me thinking brothers. Yeah, it looks like I got the best of the deal. - Hello Brock. - Ginny. - I heard you were back. - Yes. - Oh, this is Mr. Tom Williams. Tracy and Brock Mitchell. - Brock Mitchel? - How do you do you do? - How do you do, sir? - Well. - Well? - You're looking very well, Brock. - Thank you. You look wonderful. - Thank you. - How have you been? - Oh fine Brock, just fine. - That's good. Do you spend- - Do you spend- (suspenseful music) Well, bye Brock. Nice seeing you again. - Goodbye Ginny. (suspenseful music) - I was just thinking maybe after we get settled, there is no reason why you shouldn't you and Ginny. - The way her father feels about me, I don't know. (dogs barking) I don't know. - Here she comes. This is it! (jolly suspenseful music) (horses galloping) (dogs barking) - Mr. Phelps. - What? - Are you Mr. Phelps, from Washington? - No. - Alabam. - Hi Tracy, - You carry a passenger name of Phelps coming on from Washington, making connections with your coach at Gunstock. - Phelps, Washington? - A railroad man. - Oh yeah, that's the fellow. - Did you see him? - Yep. Gunstock. - He was supposed to ride in with you. - That's right. - Where is he? - Like I said Gunstock. - And did you speak to him? - Yep. - Why did he say? - Staying on at Gunstock. - Is that all? - Nope, he said had some business to attend to there. - He sent a message? - To who? - Them, Trace. - No message, except he had to stay over for business. - Yeah, well, nothing we can do about it. We just have to wait for him. - You think there's any doubt about them coming through. - No, I don't think so. More than likely he'll be here by tomorrow stage. Well, might as well get ourselves a couple of rooms at the hotel. - You figured to stay over in town for tonight. - Too hard to ride back at the ranch, and back to town again tomorrow. - Well, maybe Brock and I will go back to our place. - Might be better for you and Brock to stay on in town where we can see you. It might be a good idea to talk some more about the deal after dinner. - Yeah, we'll stay here, where you can see me. - Fair enough. - I think we've gotta stroll down the hotel and register. - There isn't anything else we can do? Let's check in. (jolly piano music) Whiskey. - Yeah. - I repeat it's the end of any town when it lets killers roam it's streets, and peaceful citizens have to hire bodyguards to protect themselves. No, man is safe. Well, women and children. If we permit gunfighters to come and go as they please. - Let's go. - Finish your drink. - How about some Chinese food across the street? - No, we'll have our drinks and dinner here, right here. - [Chad] I don't know what that sheriff was thinking of. If he's afraid of gunfighters, can't handle the situation let him say so. Plenty of men in this town are ready to protect their own. - Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell, good evening? - Yeah, good evening. - I just, well, I want you to know that I- - What's on your mind? - Ms. Ginny Clay, sir. She doesn't mean anything. I mean, I don't mean anything to her, sir. - What? - Well, I just happened to be out there. I promised her father I'd see that she got home all right, sir, and I want you to know that I didn't mean to cut in on you. - What are you trying to say? - I promise I'll never see her again, and I want to apologize to you, sir. - No, that you don't have to, it doesn't mean anything to me. - I'm sorry, I never- - I not gonna hurt you. - You are, you are. - Don't ever talk to me like that again. Don't ever come begging to me, you hear me? - Please sir, I'll never see her again I promise. - Mad dog killer. (people chattering) (suspenseful music) - No lights. I'm afraid, Tracy. - Afraid of what? - Myself. I'm afraid of what's happening to me. I'm thinking wrong. - Brock. I'm listening. - I'm beginning to think everyone hates me, plotting against me, and they think I have no friend but my gun. - There's me and Van Steeden. I think there's Ginny too. - Yeah. You remember that summer when you, Ginny, and I were playing at the Creek? Well, maybe hip high and you ran away, and got lost in the foot hills. - Two days and nights, and you didn't sleep till I was found. - Yeah. You tried to tell me then what it was like, being out there alone in the nights. You tried to tell me what that dark alone feeling. and the lost feeling was like. I thought I knew what you were saying, but I didn't, I didn't know it all. I know now I can't find a road, Trace. I wanna come back to people. I wanna open up my arms up to them. I want them to take my hand when I hold it out, not look for the gun in it. I want people to look at me again with that warm feeling that I belong. Yeah, that I belong. (somber piano music) I do belong. (piano music) - I'll run over and tell Van Steeden Mr. Phelps would be in town today. Meet you at the Queen. - Okay. - Mr. Mitchell, why did you do it? - Ma'am? - Driving my boy out of town, beating him, and threatening him. - Your boy? - Only a boy. Only 20 years old. Told him you'd gun him down if he didn't leave town. You warned him not to see that girl again. - No. No, it isn't true. - How could you do such a thing? - Ginny? Please listen to me. - Let me pass. - I swear it isn't true. - I thought it was all just talk until I heard Mrs. Williams version. - No, it didn't happen like that. - You threatened him. - That's a lie. - Everybody there heard it. - I was only trying to help. - You come as a client or as a gun? But you finally found me without a bodyguard. You know, I never carry a gun, so it should be easy for you. - You know you don't need a bodyguard. We both know why you're doing this. - Doing what? - You're playing a tight game, close to the vest. But you might've make one raise too much and be cold. You know a man can only be pushed and baited so far. - Call me, that's what I'm counting on. - He's in the business last night with a kid at the Mountain Queen, now I'm down in the street with his mother. - You know I don't think it's all just happened out with the blue. - And that's where you are fishing out in the blue. You're spinning, you're reeling. You're dizzy, Mitchell. You're losing your grip and you know it, that's the difference between us. I know how to wait it out, you don't. - Yeah, and that's the risk you're running. - Let me lay it out for you. You killed my brother, before I'm through with you, you'd wish it was the other way around. I'm going to make you a mop for every trigger, happy punk. I'm gonna push you off the land, out of town, into the saddle, onto the trail with nothing but your roll and gun. There won't be a town of a thousand miles where the sheriff won't be waiting for,. Won't be at town and a thousand miles where you'll be able to rest your head. - I've learned to take the shots as they come. - Saddle bum, just rolling and rolling till you reach that spot where the faster shot is waiting for you, and you catch that final bullet between the eyes. That's the way it's going to be and nothing can stop me. Only one thing worries me that you go quietly into some dark corner right now, and put a bullet in your head to save yourself all that grief and misery. That's the one thing I can't stop you from doing. - I know Deasy, you figure you've got a legitimate burn against me. All right, but by trying to drive me off the ranch you're hurting an innocent kid, my brother. There was another innocent kid who was hurt. He happened to be my brother, but I'll make a deal with you, I'll leave Tracy be, even see that he gets a year's extension on his bank note. All you got to do is to sign this, and get out of town. Very simple as to clear and clean admission that you killed Sim, deliberately, 'cause you were jealous. After you'd warned him to stay away from Ginny Clay. - Hold it. Raise them. Raise. What do we do with them, Mr. Deasy? - It looks like we got everything in our hands now, doesn't it? Notorious gunfighter, half the town saw him come up to the office of the man who's brother he gunned. He put the gun to me, but just in time my bodyguard. Yeah, he's a lawyer. My professional opinion, I'd say that was self-defense, clean and clear. Wouldn't you, Sutton? - Anything you say, Mr. Deasy. - Yes, I think that would hold it up in any court. Of course I had other plans for Mitchell, but this sure is one way of a little bit temptation. What do you say, Sutton? - Well, no telling how long did it drag on otherwise? And I got a job waiting for me in Durango. All right, fella, pick it up. - Making you look good for the law, huh? - No hard feelings. Just another job to me. But pick it up or I'll club you blind. (Gun fires) (punch thuds) - Hold it. (window crushes) Now, there're a dozen witnesses down there that will swear that they saw my gun fly out the window after one shot, and they'll find that bullet in the wall. Shoot now and they'll know you did it when I was in armed. - Maybe another time, Mitchell. Another place. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid you're right. - You're all right, you didn't? - No, nothing happened. - I was just coming out of the bank when I heard the shot then your gun came sailing out. What happened? - Anybody hurt up there? - No. - Come to my office. All right, what happened? - [Brock] Oh, Sutton Drew, and I knocked the gun out of his hand. The shot went wild. - Then what? - Then I threw my gun out the window. That's the way it happened. - You have trouble, Mitchell. Ever since you came back nothing but trouble. - Yeah, but I'm not asking for. - Just seems to grow around you like wheat. Well, last night, you had threatened young Tom Williams, scared him out of town. A whole bar room full of people saw you do it. We both know the reason why. - You put me in a tough spot, and I'm trying hard to think only as it's sheriff. I think of what's good for this town. I got a lot of reasons I'm trying to keep out of my mind. Yeah. We know what those reasons are. That's why I'm bending over backwards trying to be fair. But just one more thing, Mitchell, just one more thing. (suspenseful music) - Anything else? (suspenseful music) - Brock's trying. He's trying real hard to settle down. He needs help. (suspenseful music) (jolly music) (dogs barking) (suspenseful music) He didn't show? - No. - Alabama, you see Mr. Phelps in Gunstock? - Nope. - Did he say anything? - Nope. Probably just held over on railroad business there. He'll be here tomorrow for sure. - We haven't much time, Trace. - We just wait it out. - Maybe one of us ought to ride over to Gunstock. - That's a good idea. It's a hard ride, but Brock can make it there and back by nightfall. - Well, I don't know. - Why not? Let's find out how we stand with Mr. Phelps. - Might not look too good to push him like that. - That's right. You think we're all so anxious likely to drive our price down, right Norris? - That's the way I figured. - Look, our notes due at the bank tomorrow night. - Then let's wait till tomorrow night. - We have to know where we stand. It makes sense to me to ride out a Gunstock and find out. You don't trust me. - It isn't a question of trust. We're in this together and agreed there'd be no lone wolfing. - Anybody could ride who wants you. - No, you don't go to Seatumbs and Gunstock. - I don't see how I can be stopped. - You'll go and Norris and me pull out of the deal with you. Your ranch can handle the contract alone. And we train Norris and me, we might be able to make the stretch for service in the road, so make up your mind. - Let Trace go. - No, this kind of deal wouldn't look right to send a kid like Tracy. - You better keep your brother in line, Tracy. We like you, but he's trouble. Just keep him in line. - Brock? - Don't worry, Trace. I'll stay. I won't cause you any more trouble. (ambient music) (horse neighs) Hey, it doesn't seem too long ago that you, Trace, and I used to- - Yes, seems like only yesterday. A lot of water's trend down this Creek fit. - [Brock] Where did it all go gone? - Gone, I thought. - [Brock] Yeah, a lot has happened to both of us. - I'd rather not talk about it, Brock. - Maybe talking about it will help us find where it all went. - [Ginny] Will it? - It was good between us once, very good. - Brock? - Yes, Ginny. - A river can't run the other way, ever. - Maybe that's what I'm trying to do with my life, run he river backwards. But ever since I've trouble with Sim Deasy, the river just seemed to pick me up, and roll me away. No, time to swim, fight, or even breathe. You know, it doesn't seem possible that a feeling between two people could stopped cold than the time it takes a bullet to leave a gun. - Do you think it's been easy for me? - [Brock] Then why all this? - You know why. - No, Ginny, all I know is that without ever see me again, you believe what you were told that I killed a man deliberately. - [Ginny] Well, you forced me to believe it, you went away. - Look, I had never killed a man before. And that night when you wouldn't see me, you could've stopped me, Ginny. All you had to say was, "I stand with Brock," but no, you turned the other way, - Please Brock. I... - Ginny. All right, it's done. I don't wanna hurt you or myself trying to roll the river back. Just one thing, I was forced to shoot Sim Deasy, and I never threatened Tom Williams. Do you believe me? (suspenseful music) (horse gallops) - Anytime that hot shot once wants to slow down with me, he knows where he can find me. I'd even give him the draw. Well, there's the big man now. And what do you know? Look, man, no guns. A gunless gunfighter like gunless gutless wonder. - Brock, we better go. - No. - Pretty tricky, you know. Now where do you think he hides his guns? Under his hat? Maybe he's got some sort of new weapons, huh? Hey you! I mean you, gunless. You got some kind of new weapon, huh? Name it. I'll meet you with anything you call, even feather pillows at 10 paces. Well, it's better pillars, you're gonna have to give me a break. Let me throw mine, first. No wonder of the age. The gunless gutless wonder. Scares women and children out of town. Oh now, I hurt his feelings. I ain't been fair. All right, gutless, reach for it. Reach. (Sutton blows) (people chattering) (gun fires) (punch thuds) (punches thudding) (bottle shattering) - [Man] Come on! - Brock! (punch thuds) - [Man] Just get up now! - Brock, stop it! (horse neighs) Brock, stop it! Stop! You... all of you. You did this to him, pushing him. Baiting him. Sniffing at him like an animal. Making an animal of them. All he wanted was to... all he wanted was to... - [Brock] Is he dead? - No. - I wanted him dead. It's no good, Trace, a killer, an animal. I'm like an animal. - No, you're not. They're right. So many people they must be right. - No, don't let them be right. - I couldn't stop. I wanted to sink my teeth into his throat. Clay is right, I am trouble. It grows around me like weeds, every one I touch. I shouldn't have come back. I'm leaving. (somber piano music) - All right, you leave again. but not without me. You think I tried to keep the ranch going for myself, I don't want it without you. I don't want any part of that loneliness anymore. You hit the trail, I hit it with you. You live in the saddle, the saddle boom I live it with you. You can't run away from it anymore, Brock. I'm tired of holding the fort by myself. (suspenseful music) - Fix my face. I can't look like this when Phelps gets to town. Hey, easy! (sheep bleating) - Howdy? - Morning. - You come the price I'm cuttings. - No. - No? I don't know where them clothes are supposed to come from. You sure you aint a fellow named McCots? - No, I'm look- - No, funny. We've been waiting for this fella to, are you sure you aint a fella named McCots. - Listen, I'm sure I'm not a fella named McCots, and I didn't come for the cutting. I'm looking for Mrs. Williams, is she around? - Yeah, she's up by the barn. - Thanks. - I sure don't know what we're gonna do with them cuttings. (sheep bleating) (dogs barking) - Morning. - Your face, how? - I guess it's all part of what happened between us yesterday. - I don't understand. - People accusing me of running people out of town. Mrs. Williams, you know I didn't threaten your boy. Now if he left town there was another reason. - I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell. I'm very busy just now and. - Mrs. Williams, I must talk to you. I don't think you realize how important this is to me. - I've got nothing to talk to you about, nothing. I didn't ask you to come here, and I want you to go. Please, just go away. - I think I understand how you feel. Sometimes they're forced to do things one way or another, that we're ashamed of later. It isn't easy to speak the truth once the lie starts, one lie leads to another until we get in deeper and deeper, and well it looks like there's no other way, but to go on with it, no matter who it hurts, that's what's happening to you. - I've got problems enough on my own. Gotta get on with my work. Got a living to make. - And I have a life to make. (Mrs. Williams sobs) I'm sorry, I better be going. - Oh, forgive me. Please, forgive me. - It was Deasy, wasn't it? - Yeah, he came to town and said he tear up the notes if we would, (sobs) we would. - I don't blame you Mrs. Williams. I know what Chad Deasy can do. - I begged Tom not to do it, but he wouldn't listen. Said we were in deep trouble about those notes, and he meant well. - Mrs Williams, thank you. It took a lot of curries to tell me this. I only wish I could help you. There is one thing I can do though, keep this quiet. I don't care much what people think now, except one person. I'd like you to tell her the truth. - Just tell me what you want me to do. - Thank you. I'll be back. (horse galloping) (dog barks) (Brock knocks) (door opens) Hello, Ginny. - Your face? - Yeah. Ginny, I know how you feel about me. - Please Brock, there's no use talking about it. - I don't intend to. But there's one thing that's very important to me. - What is it Brock? - Ride with me, it won't take long. after that I promise I won't trouble you anymore. - Wait for me. (suspenseful music) - And Chad Deasy, he said he'd tear up the note if Tom would leave town. I hate to admit it, but I finally agreed, and promised Mr. Deasy I'd make a scene on the street to embarrass Mr. Mitchell. You never threatened Tom, I know that. I just wish I hadn't let myself to. Please forgive me. - Thank you Mrs. Williams. (peaceful guitar music) Well, that's about it. I just want you to know. (suspenseful music) - What'd you run off to while I was asleep? You've been gone almost all day. - I had to find out something. It's all right now. - I see the stage got in early. Phelps didn't show. huh? - Let's go see Van Steeden now, maybe he can come up with an idea. - All right. - The stages in. - I heard. - Mo railroad agent. - I also heard. - Is that all you have to say? - You come to my office, I didn't come to yours. - Oh, there's no reason for us to play cute with each other. Mitchell can pick up his note, and his chances of getting the money are very, very slim. - That's the bank's business. - And the depositors of which I happen to be one of the largest and a director. - Well, you should have bought my offer, Mitchell. At least you've done for your kid brother. Very well, headstrong, Always too late for the headstrong. - Mitchell's note is mot due until sundown. Tell them there's nothing to talk about. How then you'll have to, excuse me. These gentlemen are waiting to see me. - It doesn't take much in these parts to be called a gentlemen, even if you're a bankrupt. Oh, well I guess I can wait till tonight. I'm a patient, man. If I have to, I can even wait till there's a new banker. I'll see you after business hours, tonight. - It's like my trouble wits are beginning to trip you up too. - I can handle myself. - That'd be a good thing , Brock, for the community if someone can finally handle Deasy. No, no, no, don't be getting any ideas. - No worries, sir, I'm past that. - I shouldn't have said that, but that, well boys, it doesn't look too good. You just saw for yourselves what I'm up against. If you can't get some assurance on that railroad contract by sundown, we're late. Now one of you better hustle up the Gunstock and see Phelps. - You know how Norris and Riley feel about that. If they pull out on us, well, we haven't got any chance at all. - None, unless somebody gets a note from Phelps, and now I think Tracy and I see things even clearer than you what this thing means. It isn't just saving the land. It isn't just foreclosing on a piece of property. It's foreclosing on a man's life. - It isn't easy to join the human race again. Once you've been drummed out, we'll try. - You rode out of town this morning. - I didn't ride to Gunstock if that's what you mean. - No, now let's not fly off the handle. We're all under a strain. Riley didn't mean nothing. - You only made that nothing pretty plain. - Sit down and talk this out. No profit for anyone yapping at each other. - All right, let's put it on the line. You men don't trust me, but you know and respect, trace. - That's for sure. - Well, this beef deal means more to Trace than it does to me. - To us. - Our bank note's due tonight. If one of us doesn't get to Phillips before that then Tracy's lost his ranch, and he's gambling everything on this deal. - And Brock's gambling more than a hunk of property. You both know that. - Go on, we're listening. - You men can sit and wait out, but we can't. Let Trace ride the Gunstock. He can make it there and back by then. He can see Phelps and get a note from him, and we'll catch you in for a piece of our share. - Okay, Trace, - Whatever you say, Brock. - Agreed? - Where will you be while Tracy's up to Gunstock? - Where you can both see me every minute. - Agreed, and share Stan pack. - Agreed. - We better get priding. - Where are you going? - To help Trace saddle up. - He's a big boy. - You just stay with us, Brock till Tracy gets back to town, that way you won't get lonely. - Order yourself some food. He went off without breakfast this morning. - I don't know what you mean. (tense music) (horse galloping) - Mr. Phelps? - Yes. What can I do for you? - I'd like to talk to you, sir? - (laughs) Sure, sit down here. - Thank you, sir. - Something to drink? - No, thank you, sir. I'm Tracey Mitchell, Mr. Phelps. - Mitchell? - From showdown Creek. - Well, I haven't seen in the past, Mr. Mitchell, I'd expected you to be well, a little older. - Well, the boss of our ranch is my brother, Brock. He's older and very dependable. - Yes, I'm sure. Well, son, I'm glad you got here sooner, Norris and Riley with you? - Sooner? - Well, I didn't expect you until the last day of the week. I didn't mind waiting though since I had business here in Gunstock. That it was very thoughtful of you men to save me the trip to Showdown Creek. - But we've been waiting for you, sir. - Waiting for me? - In Showdown Creek. - For how long? - Three days now, sir. - But that's when I got the letter three days ago, said you were coming up here to save me the trip to Showdown Creek. - What is that, sir? - Got a letter from the attorney representing you as syndicate. Here. A Mr. Chad Deasy. (suspenseful music) (horse galloping) (gun fires) (horse neighs) - Well. - Mm, getting late. - Maybe the kids staying over in Gunstock for the night. - No. - Any word from Tracy. - No. - Getting late. - I know. - I just saw Deasy. Squatting like a vulture. Just waiting. (horse galloping) Any ideas, Brock? - No, he knows the notes due tonight. He should have been here long ago. - Here's my check for the Mitchell note. Time's not up yet. I'm a patient man, but you're beginning to try me. There's not one chance for Mitchell and you know it. - What makes you so sure? - I'll be in my office at six. Just make certain that you show up there right on time. - I'm really worried, Brock. - Yes, so am I. (door closes) (horse neighs) - Brock! (Tracy thuds) - I saw Phelps. - Don't talk, Trace. Get the doctor. Then I hid the letter Phelps gave me under some rock. - Tracy, please don't talk. - I got to tell you now, Sutton bushwhacked me. He left me for dead. I made it back to the rocks got letters. Letters that... Deasy wrote Phelps told him to wait. Other letter Phelps gave me assurance of deal to give to Van Steed. - Trace, hold on. Trace, you leave me alone. You hear me? Don't cover him! Leave us alone. - I wouldn't go in now. - Chad Deasy had your brother killed. I killed Deasy's brother and Tracy. - No, Brock. - The bullet that went through Deasy's body, my blood, it never stopped until it found Trace and killed him. - My father is the law. But the law is and always justice, Brock. You didn't murder Sim Deasy. I know that now, but Tracy was murdered. Tracy never harmed anyone. He never even carried a gun. They murdered him, Brock, and if you don't settle this yourself, you desert your own brother. You can let Trace's life go for nothing, and I couldn't love a man who would. - I can't touch a gun again. - Pay me off. - Did you get the letter? - No letter, but the job is done. - What do you mean? - The job's done, finished. Now pay me off. - the letter. - No, one's gonna find out anything until tomorrow. - Find out what? - Tracy Mitchell is dead. I had to gun him. - You killed him? - Yeah. Now pay me off. - You killed him. - My pay! - Brock Mitchell's brother. - Yeah, I killed Brock Mitchell's brother. - Brock Mitchell, you killed his brother. - Now you want the credit? All right, you say you killed him. I won't argue with you. - You don't understand Mitchell. He'll come after me. - Just be polite to him. - He'll kill me. You can't leave me. You gotta protect me. He'll come after you too, he'll kill you too. - I'll be long gone by the time he finds out. - You are my bodyguard, you've got to protect me. - Let go! - You can't leave me here alone. Let go of me. (punch thuds) (door opens) - All right Sutton, we're not slow, keep your hands up. Hold it. No, gun play. Go down to Parkman building, we want to take him alive. - But. - Wait a minute. - Hey Kim, Herbert, cover him. Hey, Herbert? Get back. (tense suspenseful music) (gun fires) (tense music) (guns firing) Hold your fire! - What's the matter? You run out of bullets? Okay, this is the way it's gonna be. I'm getting on my horse, the girls getting on with me. We're leaving this town, and nobody's gonna stop us. (suspenseful music) all right, little one. (suspenseful music) (belt thuds) - [Man] Hold it! - Sutton, let the girl go. Sutton, I'm asking you as a father, let my girl go! (door closes) - Well, the gunless gutless Wonder. (tense music) - Wait! You're my bodyguard, I paid you, you can't leave me. I'll ruin you. - Get off. (guns firing) - My bodyguard, I'll ruin you. I'll ruin all of you. Sutton bomb that's what I'll make out of you. (slap thuds) (guns firing) (horse neighs) (suspenseful music) Don't shoot. - There's nothing more that gun can do to you, or for you. (suspenseful music) (horse gallops) (ominous music) (upbeat music)
