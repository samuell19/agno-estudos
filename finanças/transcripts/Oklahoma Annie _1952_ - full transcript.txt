# Oh a little old train # Was speeding through the mountain # # All the passengers was in bed # # Holler to the fireman # Just look on the track A-head # # I fear there will be a great disaster # # We will all be killed and how # How? # They're out there strolling down # # The railroad track # Is a great big old red cow Well, what'll I do? # Oh you'd better blow the whistle # Then what? # You'd better ring the bell # Clear the air, say a prayer # Blow the whistle, blow the whistle # # Ring the bell # There was no train wreck on the fatal evening # # No, no # The train got stopped somehow # # That train got stopped # The trusty brakeman with his lantern. # # drow away the cow Go ahead, I'll stay here and keep watch. # Say the air, say a prayer # Blow the whistle, blow the whistle # # Ring the bell. How do you like it? Oh fine, I'll take it. If I pay a deposit on it will you hold it till Christmas? You bet ya I will, Bobby. With the tax, that'll be $86.66. Okay, here's the six cents. Hi, neighbor. Howdy. What can I do for ya? Give me a box of 45 shells and about three feet of dynamite fuse. Yes, sir. How much for this gun belt and holster? Oh, that ain't for sale. That belonged to my grandma. If I sold that, she'd haunt me. She sure got the face for it. Is that so? My grandma was the greatest woman sheriff this country ever had. Ain't you never heard of Oklahoma Annie? A woman sheriff? That's a laugh. Did she ride side saddle? Listen, mister, my grandma could do anything a man sheriff could do, only better. The bad men in these parts were so scared of her they either come reformed or hung theyselves by way of cooperating. That'll be $3.00, please. Judy? Howdy, Miss Fling, what can I do for ya? I wanna buy a flatiron. - Another one? What happened to the old one? - The handle fell off. You know, they don't stand up. Nice balance. Like to try it? Yeah, I think I better. Sure I don't want ya buying nothing you can't use. Is your husband's insurance paid up? I better check that first, thanks, Judy. There, looks worried already. Okay, let her flicker! Bullseye! I'll take it. Just put it on my bill. How do we stand on my account, Judy? You're practically a cash customer. That $2 you gave me last month pays you up to the first of the year. This year? No, ma'am, last year. How do you ever keep your books straight, Judy? I put my paid bills in one pile under P and my unpaid bills in another pile under U. I call it my PU system. Oh, I almost forgot, I want an alarm clock, one that'll wake my husband up. Here's a nice heavy one. This one will either wake him up or put him to sleep. Heavens to Betsy, I'm supposed to be at the bank in Eureka to see about renewing my loan! Well, the bank will be closed before you ever get there! Oh, Mr. Potter always stays few minutes after closing time, he'll let me in. Shut the door when you go out, will ya? - Yeah. - Thanks! Closing time, Sam. Bye, Mr. Jensen. My regards to your husband, Mrs. Jones. I put the ledger on your desk, Mr. Potter. Thank you, Sam. See you in the morning. The bank's closed. The bank's closed! What do you want? What is this, a stick up? Curt Walker! You got a good memory. Alright, let's have it. I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I don't think so. But the money's already in the safe! And it has a time lock on it, no one can open it before nine o'clock tomorrow morning! That's what you think. Look you busy, Skip! I don't want you running around loose. This won't do you any good. Hurry it up, Skip. Better get undercover while she blows. Mr. Potter. What's that? Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter! That's something to rouse the whole town. Mr. Potter? Mr. Potter? Mr. Pot... Help, help! Help! Help! Sheriff, help! Help! Sheriff! - What's wrong, Judy? Judy, what's wrong? Well, hello, supervisor, somebody's blowing up the safe. I gotta get the sheriff! Hold on a minute here, hold on. How do you know they're blowing the safe? Because. There she goes! Sheriff! - Judy, wait! - Sheriff! Wait a minute, wait. What is it? The sheriff isn't in. Well, where...? Look, they'll get away. Stop that, do you wanna kill somebody? That's what I was aiming to do. What's going on here? Somebody just robbed the bank. Come on, we can still catch 'em. Well, hold it here, hold it. Let's see what happened first. Alright, sheriff. Mr. Potter! Hey, give me a lift. Here, bring him right over here. We'll have you untied in just a second. There ya are. - Did they get away? - I'm afraid so. - Get a good look at them? - You bet I did. One of them was Curt Walker. - Curt Walker? - Are you sure? Curt Walker? Come now, I don't imagine he'd come back to these parts. Well, it was him alright, and I ought to know. It was right here in this bank that he killed old Sheriff Hardy. Maybe we can still catch him, let's go. Just a minute, Miss Canova, we've got a sheriff here. He'll go after Walker. You mean you had a sheriff. From now on, Mr. Supervisor, it's all yours. I'm through. Well, you picked a fine time to resign. I think it's a pretty good time. I ain't got any hankering to be the bravest man in the cemetery. Here's your badge. Well if you're all so scared to death, I'll go after him. No, you don't. Now Miss Judy, you know you owe me money and I can't take any chances on you getting killed. Hi, Blinky. Hey, Paydirt. - Hi, Judy. - Hey, Judy. Say what's out here on the sign? You ain't figured you're going out of business, are ya? No, at least wise I hope not. You sure had us scared there for a minute. The bank getting robbed kinda tightened up money, so I can't renew my loan. Gotta raise some cash to pay it off. Come on, Luther, you want a little snort of water? Come on, wet your whistle over here. Sure you don't need nothing else, Miss Fling? No, I think that'll be all. Well, that's 22.60. Well, everything's half price, that's $11.30. Just put it on the bill. Miss Flint, this is a cash raising sale. And as soon as I raise some cash, Judy, I'll give it to you. I can't see, where's the door? Wait, I'll help ya. Over to the left. That's it, turn a little bit. There you are. Thanks. Forgot to tell her about that step. What can I do for ya, Miss Fudge? I want 100 three cent stamps, Judy. Yeah. Just a minute, you paying cash for this? Of course. Ain't no profit in stamps but at least I'll get my money for them. 100 threes, that's $3. You advertised everything at half price, didn't you? Here's a dollar and a half. Miss Fudge! Too late. Well, go ahead and ask her, ask her. It's your turn, I asked her last time. You did no such another! I asked her the last time and I can prove it. Ask me what? Didn't I ask you the last time if you would run stake us. Well, I'll be diddly dad burned. Darn your hide anyhow, there you go getting me to ask her again. You ain't get no paid out yet. Oh Judy, we're getting mighty close to it. I got a feeling in my bones it won't be more than a week or so. We're gonna hit it so doggone rich. Alright boys, what do you need? Well now, let me see, we just need a couple of little things. Got everything you need? I don't believe there's any trinket we're gonna need. Is there Blinky? No, siree, with a stake like this, we've got to hit it rich. Go ahead, Blinky. Go ahead now, take it easy now, Blinky, take it easy now. She's liable to bob down. I think she's kinda holding together alright. She'll be okay, if you don't get a puncture. Oh, he won't punch her. Oh, by the way, you boys going through Eureka, you can save me a trip. Why sure, Judy, what can we do for you? Gotta get this money to the bank before it closes. Tell Mr. Potter it's only $300 but it's all I got. I'll bring the other 300 just as soon as I can get it. Alright, Judy, we'll tell him for ya. And see another thing, you know after we strike it rich, you won't have to worry about anything. No siree. Well, bye, Judy! Goodbye, Judy! Come on, Luther. Bye, Judy! Whatcha stopping here for? We got four miles yet to get to Eureka. Yeah, but Blinky, I'm hotter than a fired off pistol, boy. Say, a good cold drink would go right now, wouldn't it? Maybe it would. But if we're gonna get to Eureka before the bank closes, we gotta keep going. Yeah, but we could go an awful lot faster if we had a good drink to cool off. Maybe you're right. Hey, let's flip a coin. Go ahead, flip 'er. Heads, we go for a drink. - It's heads. - It sure is! Come on, we'll go for that drink. # Oh, where have you been, Billy Boy, Billy Boy? # # Oh, where have you been, Tom and Dilly? # # I've been to seek a wife # She's the joy of my life # She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother # # Did she bid you come in, Billy Boy, Billy Boy? # # Did she bid you come in, charming Billy? # # Yes, she told me to come in # There's a dimple in her chin # She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother # # Can you make a cherry pie, Billy Boy, Billy Boy? # # Can she make a cherry pie, charming Billy? # # She can make a cherry pie # Hooks the captain with her eye # # She's so young young and cannot leave her mother. # She's pretty good, ain't she? Hey... What'll it be? Sarsaparilla. - What's that again? - Sarsaparilla. And make it good and cold, would you do that for us? A sarsaparilla? - Yeah. - That's right. Don't think you can fool me you old buzzards, I'll turn you inside out! Just a minute, he's not fooling ya. That's a new drink, sarsaparilla fizz. Ain't you ever heard of it? No, we ain't never heard of it. Well, all good bartenders in the city are serving it. - Ain't they, Blinky? - That's the word. Don't tell me. And what's it got in it? Well, it's got a little bit of this and it's got just a smidgen of that, then some more of this. It's a mighty fine drink. Of course if you can't go on make it for us, why, we'll settle for something else. Sounds very interesting. So I'm gonna let you mix it. Well, that'll just be dandy. Of course we could settle for something else. No, I wanna see this drink. Come back here. Ow, my finger. Go on, mix it! Just what I was gonna do. I'm gonna fix one out of here now. Some of this here. See, put that right in there. And then let's see. Just a smidgen of this. Just a smidgen. That looks pretty to me. There she is, have some of that. Oh, there's that, right here. This is the bottle, ain't that pretty? So coolin' too. You see you don't put very much of this in, just a dribble, just a smidgen. But then we... But this, this is the thing right here. This is the thing that really makes the drink. I want you to watch this, you see, now you might wanna watch this. Well... Women and children first. And there you are. Drink it. What, you think I'm crazy? I've got a lot of unfinished business. Drink it! Wait a minute, wait a minute. This stuff has to age for an hour or two. While it's aging, we'll take a couple of beers. You don't get a thing till you drink it. You got any words to send home? I ain't got no home. You won't need any after you drink this. Ain't that good. Before you drop dead, I want $2.00. $2.00, yeah. And you better have the $2.00. Hey, just a minute, do you mean to insinuate that we are impoverished? Why, the idea. Bartenders will be bartenders and that's all they'll ever be. $20. Why, I'll have to get change for this. Who's there? It's Lou. It's alright. There's a couple of pigeons out here and they're loaded. Be right back. Game time, place your bets. Alright, what'd you say? Pick a lucky number. Get your money down, men. Still time to place a bet. Alright, all bets down. And winner, number six, blank. Clear out, boys! I'm buying! - Free drinks. - Free drinks! - Free drinks, bartender. Free drinks for everybody! Come on, boys, the bar's open! What'll you have, boys? I just took him for 500 bucks right over there! You mean you won $500? That's right, never been here before in my life. They always let you win the first time, it's the club rule. Give them whatever they want, bartender! What'd you do about that? Free drinks, bartender. Hey, sure would be nice if you could double Judy's money then she could pay the bank the full 600. Yeah, but so you suppose they do let you win the first time? I've heard gambling houses do sometimes. Of course they make it up when you come back to them. Yeah, but you see, we could fool 'em. We wouldn't come back. You see what I mean. Pick yourselves a luck number, boys, we're gonna spin the little ivory ball. Alrighty, here's what I'll do, I'll have $20 on number nine. Number nine. $20 on number nine it is. And the spin. You little rascal, go ahead, drop in there. - Oh, yeah! - It did drop in there! And the winner number 13, black. I could've sworn it was number nine. Alright, boys, place your bets. The more you bet, the less you lose when you win, what do you say? I'd be diddly, dad burned, if I didn't think it was number nine. Let's double up and then we can maybe break even. Here, right here. - Here's $40 on number five. - Number five. $40 on number fivt. Canova Trading Post, Judy speaking. This is Mr. Potter, Judy. You promised to have that money over here. Mr. Potter, you should've had it before now. I sent Blinky and Paydirt up with it. Well, they didn't get here. They didn't? I bet I could guess what happened to them. Okay, Mr. Potter, I'll take care of it right away, bye. And the winner, number 28, black. Oh, look, it's empty. Ain't it dark in there. Alright, boys, if you're broke, move on. Well, not just a minute. We ain't exactly broke, we got collateral. Come on, Blinky. Well! Alright, men, place your bets, still time to get your money down. Is that red or black, odd or even? Place your bets, men. Still time to get your money down. - Well? - I was asking Haskell about some of that money we got out of the bank. - I need some of it. - What about it? Listen, that money's as hot as water here. It's gonna take a little time to unload it, but you can't do it around here, you know. What about this new sheriff? He's getting in this afternoon, I'm going over to Eureka to meet him. I can't understand you hiring a stranger for that job. - That wasn't my idea. Judge Byrnes appointed him. - Think he'll be okay? - He'd better be okay. Don't worry, don't worry. I'll get Tullett in as deputy. Is this all we got? All but the burro. Tell you what we'll do, we shoot the works on 26. 26. All bets down. It's 26. And the winner, double O. Now just a minute. What's going on under this table here? Excuse me, lady. Just as I thought, you're a bunch of crooks! That's what you are! Did you see what they done, lady? So that's what you do with my money! You knew this place was crooked! Now wait a minute. You wait a minute, you big crook. The money these boys is playing with is mine, and if you don't give it back... Alright, get out of here, the three of ya! Come on. We ain't leaving here till you give us our money back. You're darn tootin', we're not. You bet we ain't. Just a minute, lady. We don't want any trouble. Let go of me, you big baboon! Captain! You can't do that! Let me go, I want my money back! Good luck. And you knew I had to get that money to the bank, so what do you do? You go to a gambling house, a crooked gambling house. Not only that, you knew it was crooked, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Go ahead and say it, Judy. Whatever it is, it's too good for us. We're just a couple of low down rats. We're smaller than rats, we're mice. Well, that crooked outfit thinks I'm gonna hold still while they take my money, they're crazy. What do you figured on doing, Judy? I ain't figuring I'm gonna do it. Hello, Ellie May, get me the sheriff's office. Well, sheriff, you just let me know if there's anything you want to fix this place up a little. Thanks, Supervisor. I think I'll make out alright. I'll get straightened around as soon as I get the rest of my equipment unloaded. If there's anything you need, you just say the word. I sure will. Sheriff's office. Hello, Sheriff? This is Judy Canova, I've got a complaint to make about a crooked gambling house over in Coffin Creek. Coffin Creek, what about it? Just this about it. This McCready fella that runs the place cheated two fellas out of $300 of my money and I want you to get it back. Well, not so fast. What evidence have you got that they were cheated? - Evidence? I saw 'em do it. Oh, is that so? Well, you're the sheriff, ain't ya, you're supposed to do something about it. Oh, I can't, huh? Well, we'll see about that. That's a lot of new fangled equipment you got there. Yes, I believe in modern methods. Can't use old fashioned ideas to catch modern criminals. You know, Sheriff, there are a few things maybe I'd better explain to you. There are several prominent citizens in this county that we may have to do a little favor for - from time to time. - Yeah? Yeah, you know, a sort of give and take. We do a little favor for them, they do a favor for us. Why, I'd be glad to do a favor for anyone anytime. If it's within the law. And that's why I called this special meeting of the women's volunteers. Something's gotta be done about the crooks who run this county and it looks like it's up to us to do it. I tell ya, this county ain't a fitting place for decent folks to live no more. With the bank robbing and murdering and such like going on. And that place over in Coffin Creek cheating the folks out of their hard earned money. - Judy's right! That gambling house is a disgrace of the community. It's taking the bread and butter out of the mouths of everyone of us here. We all know our men folks go there and lose their money. I know that mine does! Practically every cent he gets his hands on goes to those thieving varmints. And your husband too, Mrs. Fudge. Just a moment, Mrs. Fling, you take care of your husband, I'll take care of mine. And my husband's every bit as good as yours. Girls, girls, don't argue. There's a meeting going on. Very important. Now, to make matters worse, the political bosses have got themselves another crooked sheriff. One that'll do anything they tell him to do. And I say we oughta toss him out of office before he gets a chance to get started. - Now just a minute, girls. I make a motion that we appoint Judy as a committee of one to call on that crooked new sheriff and demand his resignation right now. I second the motion. Second the motion, all in favor? - Aye! - Motion carried. Aye. Now, Judy, it's all up to you. Any decision you make, remember, we're right behind you. Thank you, girls. And you can all rest assured that that sheriff will hear from the women's volunteers first thing in the morning. You girls like to buy anything? Is that new sheriff around? He's inside. What's this? Sheriff's car. Sheriff's car? You mean he's gonna ride this instead of a horse? I reckon so. Too bad they'd didn't get the old goat a wheelchair. He'll need one after I curl his hair. If he's got any hair. Where'd you say he was? He's in there! I wanna see the sheriff! He's very busy right now. I can hardly hear it. Heh. Some sheriff. Hard of hearing, too huh? Hey, Sheriff, I hate to interrupt your bedtime st... Well, how do ya do? Do you wanna see me? Sheriff, this is Judy Canova. Very glad to know ya, ma'am. What was on your mind? I don't know, whatever it was, it ain't there no more. The sheriff's a very busy man, Judy. - I'm not too busy. What is it, Miss Canova? Well, I'll tell ya, I'm right about this gambling business. He's as crooked as a dog's hind leg. It was my money and he took it plum away from 'em. And well, you just gotta something about it. Now, wait a minute. What is it you're trying to tell me? She's trying to say that she thinks the gambling over at Coffin Creek's crooked, but I'm afraid she's a little excited. Then they do have gambling over there. Well, occasionally the boys have a friendly little game, somebody loses a few nickels. A few nickels nothing, they took $300 of my money. I'm very glad you told us. We'll look into it, excuse me. Well, you're wasting your time, Sheriff. I know that place, there's nothing wrong there. Nevertheless, I feel that any citizen's complaint should be investigated. Say, maybe you should come along with us. With you? Oh, boy. Miss Canova, I think this way will be a little quicker. You won't need your horse, we'll go in my car. Well then, I'll send Penny home. Git. Go home, Pen! Hey, come back here! I ain't finished yet! It ain't gonna be legal without the sign. - Hello. Operator? Get me the Coffin Creek Cafe. So you mean to tell me when you go after a crook, you use this thing instead of a horse? This thing will do anything a horse will do. It won't run on oats. Hey, what's that contraption? Two way radio. Two way what now? Radio. No matter where I am, I can speak into this and get an answer back. You mean like an echo, huh? Well, no. Good afternoon. Welcome to Coffin Creek. How do you do? Nice weather we're having, don't you think? # Oh, where have you been # Billy Boy, Billy Boy? # Oh, where have you been, charming Billy? # # I have been to seek a wife # She's the joy of my life # She's a young thing # And cannot leave her mother # Can she make a cherry pie # Billy Boy, Billy boy? Welcome to the Coffin Creek Social Club. Would you mind? What can I do for you folks? We have some delicious Sarsaparilla today. I'd like to see Mr. McCready, please. Oh, yes, sir. # She's a young thing # And cannot leave her mother. Alright, men, feed the kitty. Judy, I can't see anything wrong with this place. It wasn't like this before. There's something fishy here. Hello, folks, my name's McCready, what can I do for you? Dan Fraser, the new sheriff. Well, I'm glad to know you, Sheriff. - You know Miss Canova here. - I've never had the pleasure. You got that bad of memory, have ya? I was here yesterday. That's funny, I don't seem to recall. Is this an official visit, Sheriff, or a social call? It's an official visit. Go ahead, Sheriff, tell him why we're here. I've had a complaint about gambling here, Mr. McCready, crooked gambling. - Gambling? Well, that's ridiculous, look around for yourself, Sheriff. I tell ya, I was here yesterday. Well, there must be some mistake. I suppose you didn't take two friends of mine, Blinky and Paydirt for 300 yesterday. Now, I ask you, does this look like a place where gambling would be going on? I've got to admit, it doesn't. It was right here, they had gambling tables. Somebody must have tipped him off we were coming. Heavens to Betsy, now who would top me off? I ain't saying but I got a pretty good idea. I tell ya I was standing right here. - What's going on? - It stinks. Oh, Mr. Sheriff, look, look, look! It's that bandit! It's Curt Walker. Take it easy, that's just one of the cowboys. Mind if I see for myself? Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Sheriff. Oh, we killed the motor. Darn near killed the passengers too. One nice thing about a horse, his legs don't spin. Looks like we're gonna have to stay here until somebody finds us. It's alright with me, I reckon. You move over here, I'll get out and push. Now, when I tell you okay, you step on the gas, okay? Okay. Alright, okay. Here we go. It's no use. There's some boards over there. Maybe if you put them under the wheels... Yeah. If those boards don't work, there's a couple gunny sacks, try them. Okay. What'd you say? I said okay. Well, alright. Oh, did you fall down? Miss Canova, let's try it again, shall we? Well, sure. Okay. You know, Sheriff, if you'd have had a deputy in your office, we could've called him on your car radio. Well, I'm gonna get a deputy, just as soon as I find the right man. Does it have to be a man? I've never heard of a woman deputy, did you? Well, my old grandma was a pretty good sheriff and folks around here say that I take after her. Now, with you and me working together... I'm afraid I'd have to think that one over, Judy. You mean you might make me your deputy? Sure, you'd go out and capture Curt Walker and bring him in and you get the job. Hot diggily, I'll do it. I wild see. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, how about my badge? Oh, you'll get that after you capture Curt Walker. Good night. Good night. Good night. Did I say good night? # I'm in the dither # A strange sort of dither # I feel like I'm flying apart # There is a feeling, a new sort of feeling # # That's buzzing around in my heart # # I've lost my hunger # But I feel much younger # I'm high as a robin above # Due to this confusion # There's just one conclusion # I guess that I'm falling in love # # Never, never, never had such a feeling before # # Never, never, never guessed what romance had in store # # Never, never, never thought I'd keep longing for more # # Never, never, never been in love before # # I've got a notion # This thrilling emotion # Won't ever leave you quite the same # # You're in a dither # Your arms say come hither # And you know just who is to blame # # Never, never, never had such a feeling before # # Never, never, never guessed what romance had in store # # Never, never, never thought I'd keep longing for more # # Never, never, never been in love before. # - Hey, Judy. - Judy. Yeah? Hey Judy, we just heard Curt Walker was seen in the neighborhood. - He was? - Yes, sir. And you better lock up tight too, in case he decides to pay you a visit. I'd like to see him try to get in here. Well, we just thought we'd warn ya. Don't worry, if that Curt Walker tries to get in this door, he'll have to crawl through a rat hole, the rat. Well, you be careful now, Judy. Yeah, you do that, Judy. - I will, don't worry, boys. - Goodbye, Judy. - Bye. - Bye. Thanks anyway. You're as welcome as a flower in May. I thought I closed that window. Excuse me. How did you get in here? Through a rat hole. Well, what can I do for you? I'm having a sale on poffy cots, coffee pots. This is a nice three quart size, solid enamel, solid steel. - Nah. - I'll tell you what, I just got a new shipment of corsets in. I got one that'll look fine on you. You know they're awful good for the figure. You got a figure, ain't ya? Sure, I figure. Even I got one. - You wanna bet? - No. Give me some .45 shells. - Some .45 shells? - Yeah. I'm gonna go take a little peak. Here's some .38s, would they do? This gun uses .45s. Oh, and you're all out, huh? Yeah, I'm all out. That's why I want some. Guess if you're all out, then you really need some. You haven't got any? Not even one? Not even one. That's all I wanna know. Hey! What're you doing? Let go, let go! Whoo-hoo! Sounded like shooting. It sure did. It sounded like it come from Judy's place, come on! Come on, she could be killed before we get back there. Come on! Luther! Come on. Come on. One, two, three! Now, put your little patty cakes up there, you ornery varmint, you. This store is sure a mess. But I reckon it was worth it. It sure was, Judy. And you did a mighty good job, too. Listen, tell the sheriff I'll be down first thing in the morning to see him. It's gonna take me all night to get this place cleaned up. Alright, I'll tell him, Judy. Come on, get out of your fur. Get on up there! Go on now, come on, get going, you. Take good care of him, boys. Don't you worry none, Judy. He'll be as safe as a baby in his ma's arms. He sure will, go on, you get out of here! - Good night. - Good night, Judy! Get on now! - Hello, Sheriff. - Mr. Haskell. I'd like you to meet Jim Tullett. - Glad to know you, Jim. - How do ya do? You'll be needing a deputy, so I'd bring Jim here around to see ya. I can't think of anybody I'd recommend more highly for the job. Jim's reliable and he knows his country like the palm of his hand. Sounds like he's pretty well qualified. You can take my word for it that he is. Now, if you're satisfied. Well, I'll tell you what you do, you come around tomorrow morning, and we'll talk about it. Hey, Sheriff, they caught Curt Walker! They're bringing him in now. How'd you get him, fellas? It wasn't easy. There he was, standing up behind the boulder, a gun ablaze out of both hands. Two more guns on his hips, but we snuck up on him and overpowered him. Pretty tough guy. - They got Curt Walker there. - That's him, alright! Oh, hi, Sheriff, here's your man right here. Good work, boys, where'd you get him? What happened? Well, it took quite a bit of doing. Yes, sir, this wasn't easy. Except for us of course. There he was, standing up behind that big boulder. A gun in each hand ablazing away at us. And I snuck up on him. Well, you did no such another. I snuck up on him. We both snuck up on him. Me from the right and Paydirt here from the left. And there he was, bullets whizzing around our head. And spattering all around us. But did we let that stop us? Oh, no siree. Well, however you did it, it was a good night's work. Yeah, yeah nice work, boys. The town owes you a debt of gratitude. How did you say that happened again? - What'd you say? - How'd it happen? Well, Paydirt, tell them. Well, there he was, that ornery critter, standing aback to that big boulder. A gun ablazing in his hand. Two guns! That's what I said, two guns ablazing in his hands. I says to myself, says "I, Paydirt, yonder is the critter that is a menace to humanity." We both said it to ourselves. "You are taking your life in your own hands," I said to myself. We both says to ourselves. But there is a figure, a critter that we have got to fetch him alive. - Listen, men! We're raising a celebration down at the old cafe, what about it? Let's show them how we treat heroes, huh? Come on. There he was, standing aback of that boulder. Guns ablazing! Neighbors and fellow townsfolk. This is indeed a great day for our fair community. A day that will long be remembered by all of us. As mayor of Eureka, I have been asked to officiate in, to officiate in... to officiate at this occasion to honor two of our well known and beloved citizens whose valiant deed you all well know. - What's going on? - Haven't you heard? Blink and Paydirt caught Walker last night. They what? ...far beyond repayment with meager words of praise. Far beyond any service we could hope to render for our fair community. And so with selfless disregard to life or safety, these two men have brought about the apprehension of a lawless creature. One who has long prayed upon the society of honest men. And so, it is with gratitude in our hearts that we gather here... We didn't mean to do what we've done, honest. That's right, Judy. You see, the townsfolk had the idea that we, we captured Curt Walker. What idea? Well, we didn't wanna tell them any different. That's right, Judy. What's going on here? - Blinky. - Tell him, Paydirt! Well, there he was, standing up behind that big boulder, guns ablazing... I mean... Aw, shucks. We didn't capture him, Sheriff, Judy did. - Judy! - Yeah. Yeah, Judy captured him... And so it is with deep pride on this great and glorious occasion that I introduce these two men. Our honored guests. Just a moment, just a moment, gentlemen, come back up here, come back up here. Your modesty is admirable, but you're not getting away with it that easily. Come right here. Well, Judy, all I can say is it was a good job. And I owe you a boat of thanks. Reckon you owe me a badge too. Badge? Why Judy, I was only kidding, you didn't think that I meant that... Well, gosh, Sheriff, I only know what you told me. You said that if I caught that fella, that you'd make me a deputy sheriff and I caught him fair and square. But Judy, this isn't any job for a girl. Why, it's tough and dangerous. Well, either you're a man of your word or you ain't. If you ain't, let's just forget the whole thing. Well, now, wait a minute, Judy, I know I promised you, but you think you could handle the job? I know I can. Well, all right, it's yours. Oh, thanks, Mr. Dan, I'll make you the God derndest deputy sheriff you ever had. Just remember, you got to handle this job just the way a man would handle it. Yes, sir. And so it is a privilege and pleasure on behalf of your friends and neighbors to present to you this small token of our esteem. Bring them in, bring them in, that's it. Here you are. Ain't these the prettiest things you ever set eyes on? Hey, we better get out of here. - Thanks. - Thank you all. Thank you very much. I'm gonna call mine Luther. What about Curt? First, we got to get you in as deputy. Then we'll take care of Curt. Come on. I swear to uphold the constitution of the United States, the laws of this state, to perform to the best of my ability the office of deputy sheriff. What's going on here? Just swearing in my new deputy. What is this, some kind of a joke? No, it ain't no joke, see the badge? Look here, young fella, you're taking a lot on yourself. I'm a supervisor here and I expect cooperation. Why, the citizens of this county will get my cooperation, Mr. Supervisor. And the cooperation of anyone attached to this office. Now, I'm here to do a job, and if I know the law, the sheriff of this county has the privilege of selecting his own deputies. Now, that's the law, isn't it? - Now, wait a minute, Sheriff. You promised last night... I didn't promise any such... No, offense, Dan, you're absolutely right about the laws. It's just that I thought Jim here was the right man for the job, that's all. I'm sorry but, I have a previous commitment. Well, sure, Dan, you're the kind of a man we need around here. Come on, Jim. Good luck, Deputy. Gosh, Mr. Dan, you sure made him eat crow, didn't ya? I don't know about that, but as long as I'm sheriff, nobody's gonna tell me how to run this office. Oh, howdy, Miss Fling, Miss Fudge. We're here to see the sheriff. He ain't in right now, but I'm his deputy. Anything I can do for ya? His deputy? Yeah, just sworn in this morning. Well, this has gone further than I thought. - I'll say it has. It seems everybody in town has been taken in with those crooked politicians. Why don't you old hags give yourselves up? Well! Perhaps we better put the situation before Judge Byrnes. I understand he's arriving today. Yes, and the sheriff's gone over to Cornwell to pick him up. And you'll hear from our women's volunteers later. Come Carrie. Goodbye. Yes, it looks like we finally got the right man in sheriff's office, Dan. Capturing Curt Walker certainly put your office off to a fine start. Well, thanks, Judge, but actually it was my deputy that did the capturing. But your office accomplished it. That deputy must be an alert, courageous young fella. Calling Sheriff Fraser, calling Sheriff Fraser. Who's that? My deputy. A girl? Sheriff Fraser speaking. Don't tell me something's happened to our prisoner. Ah, no, Sheriff, he's okay. You don't have to worry about him. - Then what is it? - I was gonna surprise you by fixing up your office but can't decide about the curtains. What color do you like, beige or green? Is that all you bothered me about? Well, not quite all, you see, the beige has red poppies in it and the green has white magnolias. Which do you like the best? Such Tommy rot. You mean to tell me she's the one who captured Curt Walker? Must have been an accident. I think it ought to be purple with everlasting flowers on it. Everlasting. You should live so long. There's a gun fight down the street. Three guys are trying to kill each other. Calling Sheriff Fraser, calling Sheriff Fraser. For heaven's sake, Dan, please come in. Stop! Stop, in the name of the law. The keys are in the desk. Gee, Sheriff, terrible, ain't it? - Yeah, who started it? - I did. - You did? - You did? Yeah, not on purpose, mind you. You see, there was a gun fight going on down the street and I tried to get you on the radio, and I couldn't, well, what was I gonna do? Well, all I know is, you should never have left your prisoner. Excuse me, Sheriff. Three guys were trying to kill each other and in stopping the fight I accidentally set fire to the fireworks, - that's all. - That's all? Not only an interior decorator, you're a pyromaniac as well. This is no time to bring in politics, Your Honor. He's gone! - Of all the dumb... - Dan, listen! Come back here, you stupid idiot. I might be stupid, but I ain't no idiot. You is no deputy sheriff, either. Round up all the men you can, Curt Walker's escaped and we're going after him. In view of what's happened here, I'm afraid we're gonna have to make some changes. It's about time. Will you get rid of the new sheriff? The sheriff has nothing to do with this, Your Honor. It was his responsibility. It weren't not. It was my fault. Gee, I don't mind getting fired, but haven't even given Dan a chance. - Oh, be quiet, Judy. - Alright, he'll get a chance. You take care of the office, Judy, I'm going after Walker. Wait a minute, Dan. I'm sorry to have to say this, but because of what's happened... I'm fired, is that it? Nothing personal, do you understand? Because there's a possible chance that you and your posse might get Curt Walker, we're going to give you the opportunity. But if he's not back in that cell in 24 hours, we're going to demand your badge. Very well, Judge. Come on, Lottie, at least we've started at house cleaning. # Have you ever been lonely? # Have you ever been blue? # Have you ever loved someone # Just as I love you? # Can't you see I'm sorry # For each mistake I've made? # Can't you see I've changed, dear? # # Can't you see I've paid? # Be a little forgiving # Take me back in your heart # How can I go on living # Now that we're apart? # If you knew what I've been through # # You would know why I ask you # Have you ever been lonely? # Have you ever been blue? I got a flat tire. Anybody around here that can fix it? Nobody here but me, and I'm closed up for the night. That's just dandy. I suppose I'd be presuming too much to expect to find a telephone around here. I don't know how big a presume you got, but there's a telephone inside that I never had no trouble in finding. Thanks. Just leave your nickel on the blotter. Hello? Get me the Coffin Creek Cafe at Coffin Creek. Hello, Mr. McCready, this is La Belle La Tour. Is Curt Walker there? No, he isn't here yet, I expect him pretty soon. Okay. I had a little tire trouble on the way over. Tell him I'll see him there later. Hey, I think we can change that tire. You just unlock the spare and I'll go get some tools. Okay. Hello, get me the sheriff's office. I guess you boys better turn in. - Why, Sheriff! Any luck? No luck, Haskell. I think I know where your man is, Sheriff. I was riding through the hills about 12 miles west of town. You know, just the other side of Big Bear Rock. I saw a camp fire, there were two men, I got up as close as I dared, looked to me like Walker and his partner, so I came back here for help. Well, get the boys and round up all the available men and meet at Big Bear Rock, and I'll join you as soon as I get a fresh horse. Be with you in a minute. Hello? Hello, Dan. Yes, this is the sheriff. This is Judy. You got to get over to Coffin Creek. Curt Walker is... Look Judy, you've caused me enough trouble already. Now, you better stick to running that store and let me handle this end. Oh, but Dan, if you'll only listen to me. I tell ya, I know what I'm talking about. Sorry, Judy, I'm in a hurry. Hello? Hello? I couldn't find no tools but I called the garage. Man will be right over to fix the tire. Now, you tell me, I've already got the spare off. Oh, gee, that's too bad. Well, he's coming right over. You make yourself at home. I got a few things to tend to, I'll be right back. Lucky thing for me, you running into those two men over at Big Bear Rock, you sure they didn't see you? I'm positive. Dan, Dan, you just gotta believe me! Curt Walker's at Coffin Creek! Wait a minute, how can Curt Walker be at Coffin Creek when he was seen tonight about 20 miles from here in the opposite direction. But I tell ya, some woman phoned from my store. She's meeting Curt Walker at the Coffin Creek Cafe. What woman called in? I don't know, she had a flat. Gee, I never told a lie in all my life, honest engine. I'll just take a fast run over there in the car. Attaboy, Sheriff. You mean you're gonna waste time to investigate a crazy... I am not crazy. Well, if he's not there, I can still get back in time to join the posse. Well, I'll ride over with ya. Me too. No Judy, you better stay here and hold down the fort. Shucks. Well, Sheriff, now that we're alone, I guess we can talk man to man. Shoot. I've had you spotted for a pretty smart young fella. The kind who'd like to go places. Naturally I want to do my job as best I can, if that's what you mean. What I'm talking about is a lot bigger than your job. - Yeah. - I guess you've noticed that I have considerable influence around here. I can be a big help to you, if you'd, well, if you play ball the way I see it. I don't think I quite get what you mean. I think you do. Well, if you're leading up to what I think you're leading up to, you're taking kind of a long chance, aren't ya, Haskell? Propositioning a man you hardly know. I'm not taking any chance. If anything I'm saying here was to be repeated, I wouldn't even know what you're talking about. Around here, my word's better than yours. I see what you mean. What's your proposition? Well, in the first place, I have certain connections. They may be a little outside the law, but they pay on pretty well, if your department looks the other way. - I see. And this gambling set up over at Coffin Creek is one of those connections? Now you're getting smart. Well, assuming that we could work out a deal, I would play ball with you, just where would I come in? That's something we'll have to talk over with McCready and Curt Walker. - Is Curt Walker in there now? - That's right. Well, let's go in and talk them. Dan, don't listen to him, don't go in there! Hold it. You thought you'd pull a fast one and leave that microphone open. Alright. Let's go in and meet the boys. Dan? Hello, Dan? Hello? Help, help! Hey, somebody, I need help! Help! Come in, come in. Get your horse and ride for Eureka as fast as you can. Judy Canova's in the sheriff's office. Get her, don't let her talk to anybody, just get her, and get rid of the sheriff's car out front. He'll never make it, Haskell. Judy will have time to talk to someone. Talk to who? Everybody in town's out on sheriff's posse. Your posse. Help, help! Help, somebody! Help! What's all the shouting for? I'm trying to raise somebody. Hey? I'm trying to raise somebody. There ain't an abled bodied man left in town, they all rolled out an hour ago. Maybe there's some able bodied women. They seemed to be pretty able that time when the men folks had left, they had to put out the fire over at the church. Fire? Hey, thanks. What'd you say? - What's the matter? What's the bell for? Men are all out of town tonight! It's a job for the women's volunteers. Be right down. Where's the fire, Judy? Where is it? - You'll find out! Come on, girls. Hurry, everybody! You ain't tell us where the fire is. You'll find out. If you got us out of bed on a false alarm! Don't worry. Say, we're headed straight for Coffin Creek! That's right, the Coffin Creek Cafe. She said it's the cafe! - Then I say let it burn! - But it ain't on fire. If it ain't on fire, why are we going there? To save the sheriff, to capture Curt Walker and put an end to that Coffin Creek Cafe! Come on, Miss Fling, let's clean that place out. We all got axes ain't we? What did she say, Miss Fling? Shall we turn back? She said plenty! Keep going, Mrs. Fudge, to the Coffin Creek Cafe! Charge! I sure hate to do this to you, Sheriff. We got a lot of axes to grind with this place, girls, so don't forget them. Come on! Alright, girls. You're on your own! # What can the matter be... Ladies, just a minute, please! Please, what's going on here? Whoa! Alright, girls, battle stations! Charge! # Dear, dear, dear, dear # What can the matter be? # What could the matter be? # Dear, dear, dear, dear # What can the matter be? Are you ready? Bombs away! - Where's Dan? Where have they got the sheriff? - I don't know, Miss Canova. Honest, I don't. Oh, no? Ah, so that's where he is. Dan? Dan, you in there? Judy, watch out, it's Curt Walker. Shut up, Fraser. Judy, I was ever so glad to see you in my whole life. If my hands weren't tied I'd give you a big hug. I'll have you untied in a jiffy. You better go after him! - Let go! - Let go! Cut it out, will ya? Get your hands off! Stop it! Ow! Let go of me, let go! Ow. Oh, ouch! Let me out of here, get away from me! Let me out of here! - Hello? He ain't in. Ow! Ooh! Oh! Cut it out, will ya? Hi, Sheriff. Wanna play? Come on. Neighbors and fellow townsfolk. Well, it looks like the election was pretty near unanimous. And as your friend and still mayor... I would like to announce the new county supervisor. You're all familiar with his accomplishments as sheriff. So he needs no further introduction. My old friend, Dan Fraser. Thanks, neighbors. What was accomplished by the sheriff's department was due mainly to the efforts of the deputy sheriff. And I'm proud to present her to you now. As the new sheriff of Kirk County, Judy Canova. That's our Judy, that's our Judy! Hey, Judy, speech. Give 'em a speech, go ahead. Gosh, I ain't never made no speech before, but I do want to thank you for this here badge and tell you that I'm gonna do the best I can for you folks what give it to me and... # I'm so excited, so doggone excited # # I don't know just what to say # # 'Cept to tell ya how perfectly swell you # # Have all made me feel here today # Come on, folks, everybody join in! # Never, never, never had such a feeling before # # Never, never, never guessed what romance had in store # # Never, never, never thought I'd be longing for more # # Never, never, never been in love before #
