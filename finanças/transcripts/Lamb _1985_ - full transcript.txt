[music playing] I can't see Brother Benedict as my spiritual leader on this Earth. I just resent everything he stands for. PRIEST: Ah, you see pride again. The worst sin of all. Well, that's the way I feel. PRIEST: Look, only by bending your will to others and above all God will you find your true self. I've tried. PRIEST: Not enough. Your lack of belief is sheer pride. God knows I've tried. PRIEST: You see, you believe. There is a core that resists giving up your will. You must continue to pray, even though you don't believe. Loss of faith can be temporary. We've all gone through it. Right. If there's nothing else, God give your pardon and peace, and I absolve you from sins in the name of the Father and of the Son of the Holy Ghost. [theme music] [interspersed voices] Haleron, how many times have I told you, you measure it twice and cut once Get a new piece. [inaudible] [inaudible] It's only me, boys. [knock on door] Come in. Brother Sebastian, this is Mrs. Kane. And this is her son, Owen, whose company we're about to have the pleasure of. Not yet shaven and already a scoundrel, but he'll not be that when we send him back to you, Mrs. Kane. How long will it take? As long as it's necessary. Kill and cure is my method. There may be pain in the curing process, Mrs. Kane, but I'm sure we'll have your backing. Indeed, you have, Brother Benedict. It was my last hope after the others. Two of them. Both in jail. I let him get away with murder. And this all the thanks I get for it. If I'd been like some mothers I know, I don't know how often he's run away, five or six, so I'm tired of it. But I just can't cope with it anymore. I've tried everything else. BROTHER BENEDICT: You see what you've done, boy? I hope you're proud of yourself. Brother Sebastian, will you show Master Kane to his quarters? Watch him. He has a tendency to lift anything which is not nailed down. Too bloody right. This is you, Kane. Personals in here. Put these on. I'll be outside. And the boy's father? He's in England. Since? Two, maybe three years. How did he treat the boy? Well, he'd give him a smack sometimes for wetting the bed. Smack? Yeah, with the shaving strap. And is there anybody else now? No. I meant, to keep the boy in check? No, there's nobody. You're train. Dublin's a long walk if you miss it. Thanks very much, Brother, for all you're doing. I can't tell you what a weight it is off my mind. It's what we're for. [knock on door] BROTHER BENEDICT: Come in. What a despicable piece a goods. The boy? The mother. Ah, I should warn you the boy takes fits. How is your father? Oh, fine. Fine, thanks. It's hard to tell from letters. He always puts a brave face on things. Hey, Mol. Michael. Michael. Who's the man. How are you? As you can see him fighting fit. Good. Good. You're looking well yourself, Michael. Thanks, Molly. Well, I'm off. Some of us have to work. Sorry, Dad. Molly? Hm? How is things? Oh, he's doing good. [inaudible]. Bye, now. Goodbye. Thanks, Molly. Great. Tea. and angel cake. The elephant never forgets. Ah. Just a bit. Oh, sorry. Was that my fault? Yes. Mind my ears. I hate water in my ears. All right. Eak. Sit up. OK. Up to bed. Come on. Stiff elbows. One, two, three. You remember that? You were way up to my knees in the stream lift your cross stiff elbows, like Saint Christopher. Damned if I could do it now. Sit up. Now sit. You sit back. You're as bad as your woman with the orders. Does none of the power come back? Not much. Ask me, till I go. Who's talking of going? Just how I feel it, Michael. Don't be daft. It's just that there's no one to take over the farm. What? Ah, never mind. There wasn't a happier man in Ireland the day you joined the brothers. It's just that it will have to go with me. The face is more important than everything else put together. [crowd sounds] Come on! That's it! Come on. Fast. Where did you get these scars? - Me Da. What for? Come on, boys. Come on. Come on, Kane. How many months are you going to trail on this one, eh? Keep your nose clean for three months. Yeah? And write to your uncle. See if he'll give you a start when you do get out. Send in the next, will you? OK, Kane. You were saying the last day without your mother. Tell me that story again. I want to get it right. Which? The pillow. She was pissed, that's all. Her and this man got pissed noise in bed. And she came and put a pillow over your face, yeah? I told you I was having a fit. And she said? No, sir. If it wasn't for you, you bollix. Didn't she say that? I don't know whether to believe you or not. I don't give a fuck. Here it goes. But try and cut the onion. All right? It's not going to come up out of the ground on its own accord. Now, I can get rid of this one for start. Come on. Pick those there. O'Donnell. Kane, did I see you give him cigarettes? Who, sir? Come on. You know it's against the rules. Come on. - No, sir. - You too. Come on. Don't let me catch you with this again, I don't. Go on. Hurry up. No mates. Eh, these things are bad for the lungs. How many do you smoke? Even one is too many. Fuck me. [sniffing sounds] This place smells like a piss house. Kane the stain. Ah! Leave him alone, O'Donnell. Are you OK? Fuck off. All right, Patrick. That will do. The weeds are starting up. OK? Brother, is this a weed? No, that was a leek. If you're in trouble, boys, put up your hands. Don't sit there like prunes. [knock on door] Brother Benedict wants Kane, sir. Kane. You carry to 1. 3 minus 6. Look at his wrists, Brother. Get on with your work. Kane, the problems are on page 45. How many did he give you? Six. A full half dozen. What was it for? Did you? Well, what made him think it was you? He said it was me initials. What was? O-K. Owen Kane. Holy Jesus. Hello, Brother Sebastian. I was expecting you. Brother Benedict, I must protest in the strongest possible terms about the thrashing you have just given young Owen Kane. I'll thank you to calm yourself. He did not sign his name to any slogan. OK, it's a slogan in itself. They simply add it to the end of things. Credit me with a little intelligence. You know and I know that we will never find the real culprit, as long as somebody gets hammered. The O-K just a little lying of me own. Benny dies, OK. Now, the boys know Benny has risen. K-O. Anybody who says he loves children doesn't understand them. It's time he learned that discipline is love disguised. And the stick shows we care, you know? When you do use it, you must use it to hurt. Which class you may choose you're in. [knock on door] Yes. Brother. Oh, God. Is there anyone there? What for did you take yourself? Get in. Benedict will kill me. At least give it time. Where were you heading to anyway? Home. But you were always running away from your own home. Why? Why? [knock on door] Come on. Ah, Brother Sebastian, come in. Make yourself comfortable. Forgive my appearance, but I've decided once and for all to catalog me books. A man with one language is like a man with one eye. How did the funeral go? Oh. Is anyone left at home? No. No. No. My mother died a few years ago. I know. I know. Your father was a good man. Yes, he was the best man I ever knew. Sad. Sad. Forgive me asking. Did he die intestate? I'm sorry? Intestate. I'm surrounded by the education is so narrow. Did he die without leaving a will, I mean? Everything goes to me. Ah, good. These are hard times, Brother. I sometimes think we should have the boys neutered to save on laundry bills. Pardon? The sheets, man. You know. Is it a big farm? After the debts, there'll be very little. Ah, it all helps. Brothers are sorely in need of it. Brothers? Oh, remember your vow of poverty, eh? I'm thinking of leaving. Freedom is an infliction. Who or what Brother Sebastian, is tempting you to leave? A vow of poverty? No. What then? My lack of faith, everything. Everything. This place, what it stands for. A place that can treat a 10-year-old boy as a criminal. Oh, we have our favors to our young Owen Kane, is it? You know what that can lead to? No, I don't know what that can lead to. Do you believe at all in the church? A boy who is old enough to go to communion is old enough to break the law. What if they don't realize what they're doing? Diminished responsibility can only be claimed by idiots and nuns. On the contrary, Brother. What we run here is a finishing school for the idle poor. We teach them a little of God and a lot of fear. Oh, we finished them, all right. That's what I think. You trouble, Brother Sebastian, is that you can't think. Brother Benedict, I am very capable of thought. Ah, your overwrought, Brother. Like it or not, I am your spiritual father. Join me in me walk every day next week, and we'll discuss your difficulties. How about that? If you decide to remove, you know, I can make it difficult for you. The church in Ireland, Brother, has many fingers as there are pearl. Some day, Brother, I'm going to fucking do you. Oh. Come on. Tarawly said was all you were good for is minding their clothes. That's if there's no money in their pockets. You don't trust me. And you don't trust me either. To God knows what would happen to you if he went into the water in your condition. Kelly, that'll do. They said prayers for you in the chapel when you were away. Ones for me? Well, for your Da. Is he OK, your Da? Yes, he was. He was. We were very good friends. Friends? You were glad that we do it? I was. Have you ever thought of running away again? Nah. That was that car. What would it mean taking you away? Even me? I have to arrange it first. What do you say? The Brother Sebastian or Michael Lamb today? I think Michael Lamb may be best for business. Right. Sit there. Right-eo, Michael. What can I do for you? If you can tell me how much? Oh, not exactly. There's still some debts. I say it wouldn't be a kick the ass off 2,000 quid. If you'll pardon my French, Brother. When? A couple of months. Just the way the law grinds, Brother. Why the urgency? Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies, eh? I get the picture. Look, I know more than you think. I can let you have something in advance. How much? This much? It'll cost you, mate. Let me have your signature right there. Oh, sorry. Just between you and me I'm doing you a favor. Had a call from your superior the other day, Brother Benedict. What? Yeah, I thought that might interest you. Don't worry. I said I'd rather talk to you before doing any business. Thanks. Thank you. You did the right thing. Sorry about this. They can hone you with age like old celibates. You wanted to discuss something. Yes, but we've got plenty of time for that, once we get over this phase of yours. Would I'd-- thanks. What I'd like to know is how your father's death comes into this. I've just been reading Tacitus again. He says of his father-in-law Felix opportunitarte mortis. Is the case with you? It means looking in the time of his death. Did your father die just as your doubts came, or had you been waiting for him to go? I don't know. I suggest you think about it. Above all, spend some time on your knees in prayer. I'll see you tomorrow. Brother. Good night. What time is it? Easy. Where are we going, Brother? Less of the Brother. Me name is Michael, all right? How do you do, wouldn't you, Brother? When I was your age, my father held my hand. Wait here, Owen. Hello. Hello. Um, I'd like a wedding ring, please, not too dear. Ladies or gents? I've lost mine, and I don't want the wife to know. Oh. Anything there take your fancy? See anything like it? Like what? Like the one you lost? Oh, that's it there. Right. Let me see your size. Is that comfortable? A little bit sharper on the edges. That's fine. Till death us do part. For richer, for poorer. It's great. [knock on window] I shouldn't bother with the box in case your wife finds it, you know? Oh, yes. How much is that, please? 30 pounds, please. You're not from Dublin? No. Just here for the day? M-hm.

A place if you want it. Not too fatty. [static] MAN (ON RADIO): Detectives investigating the kidnapping of the 10-year-old boy from Galloway are now extending their inquiries following the case. In a statement issued today by Brother Benedict, the head of the special school, the concern was expressed about the misappropriation of funds, which had been designated for use by the order. It is expected that additional charges will be brought. Police stations in Britain have been alerted following the report that a man and a small boy fitting the descriptions were seen in [inaudible] boarding the fairy to Molly Head. This is Bernadette King, the boy's mother, confirmed to police from her Dublin home that her son is epileptic and may be in need of medical supervision. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): You were saying the [inaudible] about your mother. Tell me that story again. OWEN (VOICEOVER): Where is she? MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): The pillow. [inaudible] knows me bed. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): If it wasn't for you, you bollocks. [makes gunshot sounds] You done me wrong, kid. You did me. You did. [yells] - OK. OK. OK. Now, run about. It's a day for doing some work. School work. Oh, come on, Mick. You have to start sometime. Now, sit down there and read. Pierre is here. Jane is here Pat likes the water. Pat likes fun. Come into the water. Come, come, come, come. OK, smarty pants. All right. Here's something a bit more difficult. Start there. The first word's Daedalus. Daedalus contrived to escape. But he could not leave the island by sea. Island. So he set to work to make wings for himself and his young son, Icarus. Icarus. That's right. He roost feathers. He what? Roost. Show me. Wrote. It means to work on, fashion. He next equipped his son in the same manner and taught him to fly. Icarus, my son, he said, if you fly too low, the damp will flog your wings. And if too high, the heat will melt them. Keep near me and you will be safe. As he said these words, the face of the father was wet with tears and his hands trembled. He kissed the boy not knowing it was for the last time. The boy began to soar upwards as if to reach heaven. And nearness of the blazing sun softened the wax, which held the feathers together. Vainly he fluttered with his arms as his mouth uttered cries to his father and was submerged in the blue waters of the sea. I feel funny. Did you take your epilim? Lie down flat then. Do you want me to read to you? Nah. It's crap. You say that about everything. You're smart enough. You just never went to school long enough to learn your teacher's name. - Miss Malquikium. Ah, ha, ha. Is there nothing you are interested in? Arsenal. Would you like to go and see them play on Saturday? Maybe they're give you a trial. Nah. I'm too young. [crowd cheering] Hey, not here. Hey, what you doing? He's having a fit. [inaudible]. Get him in the park. [crowd cheering] [inaudible]. Jesus. Jesus. [inaudible] I'm his father. I'm his father. I'm the boy's father. It's OK. It's OK. You've had an attack. How do you feel? Owen, listen. We're going to have to leave. Otherwise, they might start us in a lot of questions. Do you think you can walk? Back to the match? Owen, don't be stupid. Here. Nice and easy. Easy. [inaudible] Are you OK? Come on. [yelling] Hey, my sons been ill in there. I'm trying to get out. [inaudible] you, sir. Follow me. Yes, sir? Could I have some of these, please? You'll need a prescription, sir. Well, my doctor's in Ireland. We're over her on holidays. I'm afraid, sir, we can't give these without prescription. How can I get one? I can give you a list of GPs. One of them can check with your old doctor. Thanks, no. But there's no worries at stake, not yet anyway. Excuse me. How could I find a book on epilepsy, please? Just over there, sir, under neurology. Thanks. This is Michael Lamb. Michael. - Do you remember me? - Of course. I have some money left. Oh, I doubt that. Yeah. But you said there was about $2,000. Now, wait a minute, Michael. Is the boy with you? Yes. Is he all right? Of course. Just hold a minute, Michael. You still there? Yep. OK. If there is any money, where can I send it. Can I trust you? Michael, of course you can. Is the [inaudible] in England? Well, you can get me at the-- I don't know I can trust you. Look, you know me well enough by now, Michael. How am I going to get this money to you? Are you in London then, Michael? How are you? How do you feel? Starving. Come on. Lean forward. Sit back. That's it. OK? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yes? Hello, reception. Could I have tea and sandwiches for two, please? Room 10. WOMAN (ON PHONE): What sort of sandwiches? Chicken? Chicken, please. Yeah. WOMAN (ON PHONE): OK, love. Thank you. Well, when you were sleeping it off, I went out to a bookshop to try and find out something about it. There's no real cure. But you know what it said? It said that a typical symptom was a thing called a fugue. Now, that means you can travel for days, weeks, without knowing what you're doing. Hey, that makes us out to be a couple of fuguers. Hey, watch your language, fuguer. Was I bad? As bad as I've seen you. At least you didn't wet yourself. Do you remember anything about it? Nah. The only bit is just before it starts. It's weird. Like what? You know when you're writing on a blackboard and your nail scrapes? Oh, yes. No. It's noise. I'm not with you. Everything's right, the right color, the right smell. It's great. If sounds a bit daft. It's hard to explain. Yeah, so it seems. But I think I see what you're getting at. I'd light to be like that all the time. What? A permanent fit? Even now? Nah, not now. Right. I'm your fairy godmother. Three wishes, what would they be? A million quid. No, no, no, real things, things you'd like. To be able to fly. I said real. In a plane. OK. To be able to swim, to score for Arsenal, and play the guitar. Hey, that's four. Well, then my wish would be to have four. Oh, sneaky. How's the little man now? Oh, he's much better. Thanks. This lad needs fattening. He's a rickle of bones. Is Mrs. O'Leary at home? No. Mrs. O'Leary is dead. Oh, I'm sorry about that. God rest her. Did you get mass then? Oh, yes. Yes, we did. Was it Father Flynn Setish? I can't remember. No. Bald as an egg. You can't miss him. That's him. That's him. Father Flynn always says that a young boy after a good confession in the state of grace is one of the most beautiful things in this world or the next. Can you get right you're [inaudible]? Mm-hm. I like to keep up with what's happening at home. Trouble in the North is terrible. Awful. And now this kidnapping business? Have you heard about that? I think I heard it mentioned the other day, actually. A man about your age and a young boy. It's terrible what some people get up to. How long did you say you'd be staying. A couple more days. Listen ma'am. Thanks for the teas. Don't mention it. Good night. Sleep tight, darling. Good night. She knows. Nah. I'm not moving hotels again. I'm not. She hasn't a clue, honest to God. You're on your own? What do you mean? Are you with anybody? I have a boy with me. Every cripple has his own way of walking. He's my son. We're very broad-minded here, you know. Needs a bit of tidying up. There's some kitchen in there. Oh, it's you. Oh, it's my [inaudible]. He shares with me. Shit, man. Now, hold your horses. I want you to meet-- oh, I've forgotten your name. Michael. Michael. Michael. He's moving in here. No shit. No. He's moving in with his little boy. He's so touchy. With a spot of imagination, this could be a palace. Where are you? You big bastard. You big bastard. What's the matter? What's the matter? I thought you'd run away. [inaudible] - Hey, listen. Easy. Easy. Owen, please. Please. Easy, easy. Listen, we're mates. I'd never run away from you. I'd never run away from you. People that love each other must trust each other. OK? I've got good news. We've got a place to stay for good. The money will last longer. Just like home. Crap. MAN: Bloody pain in the ass. This is better than a hotel any day. We're here. So I noticed. This is Owen. Well, how do you do? I rather think I had a little too much to drink last night. I'm going to have to get a job. You can't be put in England, can you? It's OK. There's other things. Haddock might be useful in more ways than one, you know? He's a bit of a crook, knows his way around regulations. Maybe he can fix us up with papers or something, a new name. What good would that do? It would make us normal. If you're going to adopt somebody, you need papers. And then we could get you to a doctor for a prescription and maybe into a school somewhere. I don't know. It's what the real world's about, Owen. [yelling] MAN: Why don't you pack your bags and get out? MAN: Do you want to know? Do you really want to know? But don't you worry your head about it. Go to sleep. Grandma Me used to make spoons. Yeah. You're all bones. That's what she used to say. [radio playing] Dunditos for your breakfast. That's for your lunch. And write me an essay about the home. No. And don't light the fire just in case. I won't forget me tablets. And don't forget your tablets. Bloody hell. Cheese again. Every fucking day, cheese. Complain. What's the point? She already make me love meself. Where are you from? The North. Are you one of us. I'm not one of them. MAN: Oh, you decided to come back. Where have you been? Sometimes you can be very trite. [inaudible] so loud. [telephone ringing] Hey, Owen. How's the working man? How did you get on today? He got on fine. And we got on very well, didn't we Owen? Yeah. Yes, well, how about seeing ya. Haddock, I must speak to you sometime. Oh, what about, ol' cocky? I'm not sure yet. Well, come back when you are sure. Otherwise, wasting my time. Carry on. So how did you pass the day. Smoke and eating. I was bored. Did you do the homework I sent you? Your man told me not to bother. He did, did he? He said it was a crap idea. I give the orders around here. Do it tomorrow. I don't think this is going to work out, leaving you for so long. Anything could happen to you. [inaudible] here all day. That's what I'm afraid of. He's a laugh. [music playing] MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): And she came and put the pillow over your face, yeah? OWEN (VOICEOVER): She was pissed. That's all. I told her [inaudible] in her face. [gasps] [music playing] Hey, old lady. Kid? [music playing on radio] Here comes a breadwinner. What are you doing? What are you doing? Smoking. Smoking what? Oh, my god. If I catch you interfering with that child again, so help me god. Jesus, man. You sound like my mother. Well, Jesus. I don't believe it. Owen and I had quite a nice talk, brother. Listen, smoking fags is one thing. But Jesus, Owen. Drugs? Did he touch you? [grunts] Did he do anything to you? [grunts] Owen, Owen, how much did you tell him? How much did you tell him? MAN (ON RADIO): A 32-year-old religious brother is still being sought by police in the Galloway kidnapping case. Detectives flew to London yesterday following confirmation that a woman in a Bay's Water motel reported that the missing pair stayed there for a number of days last week. Amid growing fears for the safety of the boy and the head of the special schools spoke out yesterday. MAN (ON RADIO): I'm deeply concerned about this boy, not just for his physical well-being. The man who abducted him-- by the way, his father died recently-- is under stress and is capable of anything. OWEN (VOICEOVER): I'd like to be like this all the time. MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Having a fit. OWEN (VOICEOVER): Everything's right. It's weird. It's great. Hey. Hey, that's me. We're going to have to leave, Owen. Got loose. Where's the last place they think of looking for us? Japan? No, you idiot. Home, now that they're looking for us here. But not to home. Owen. OK. OK. Our own kin. To Ireland. [busy airport sounds] Keep your eye on that. I'll be back in a second. Don't worry. [airport announcement] Look, Mick. Europe. Jesus. Fuck me. This is disastrous. You pray. [inaudible] anymore. FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Pardon, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of Captain Karen and his crew, we welcome you on our Air Lingus flight to Dublin.

Good Lord, go have another one of these just in case. Oh, shit. No togs. - Doesn't matter. We'll go in our drawers. Come on. [laughter] Come on. Run this way. [yelling] [gasping] Well, we haven't missed much. What the hell was everyone talking about? [laughing] Oh, bastard. Come here. Owny. Please, help me. Jesus, if you're up there, help me. Make it die.
