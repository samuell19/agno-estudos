- Hey Carl, it's Haleye. Yeah, how are you? I'm good. So I have a little bit of an issue with your. Yes, Carl, I get the joke, but look, you've already accidentally tweeted a few times from the company's account. So far, our followers have seen your Tinder pictures and admittedly, very cute video of your cat. And now a very lazy joke about getting crabs from a diner. - We're viral, Haleye. - Listen, Carl, this is a startup and our social media presence matters. Yes, of course we are letting you go. - Hey, Eric needs to see you. Got it, okay. - I'm sorry. Yes, that's right Carl, this will give you more time to focus on your standup. No Carl, I will not go to your improv show, but I wish you the best. Steve. - Yes. - I need you to hold my calls while I go upstairs. - Is this about the crab tweet? - Ivy league education, years of corporate climbing, now I'm having a meeting about the crab tweet. This is my life. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Hey Haleye. - Hey. - You can go on in. - Thank you. - Oh, Haleye. - Yeah. - I have some inside information about Carl's crab tweet. - Oh? And what is it? - Carl did get crabs, that's true, everyone knows that. - Okay. - But he did not get them from Bay City Diner. That was just a joke. It's called a play on words. He was trying to be funny. - Well, thank you for clearing that up, Lauren. - You're welcome. - Yeah, yeah, I'm looking to invest in those NFTs, did you get in on that yet? Yeah, nah, it's like the whole thing. Oh, yo, yo, hey, I gotta go real quick. Can I call you back? Yeah, yeah, totally, totally, it all sounds good. Just take care then all right. All right, later, later days, huh? Oh, what's up, Haleye? - Oh. Look, Eric, I just wanna assure you that Carl has been let go. We've deleted the tweet and we have a team in place fielding complaints. - Oh, okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Whoa, whoa, whoa, who's Carl? - Carl's the social media guy who sent out the offensive tweet yesterday. - Offensive? Really us like, oh wait, wait, wait, wait, the tweet about having crabs. No, no, no, that was hilarious. Oh, that was not? - No. - Ah, bummer. I thought you came up with that one, Hales. No worries. That's not why I called you up here anyway. Have a seat. - Oh, okay. - So, okay, as I know, you know, we have several grocery chains that wanna buy the company. - Yes, how can I help? - That's my girl. Not my girl, I didn't mean it like that you're. You get it, it's fun, you know what I mean right? - Yeah, no, I do. - Okay, good. - Yeah, I do. - Anyway, I'm taking a few of the guys on a retreat to Arizona and I need a baller presentation to show them. - Oh okay. - You have shares in the company, so the better the presentation, the bigger your check will be. - I'm on it. I got this, Eric. - I know you do. That's why I called you in here. High five. - Five. - Say you take that energy with you, huh? - Yep, got it. - You got this hailstorm. - Okay. Have fun in Arizona. - Thanks. - Sorry, Charlie, not right now. - Still no answer? - Ah, she's busy, she'll call back. - Does she know how important this is? I think we should run the numbers again. Maybe reach out to Cedar Creek Bank. - Well, I have an appointment at Cedar Creek next week. - No, we need Haleye. No, she's gonna help us figure this out. - I'll keep trying, don't worry. - Hopefully she answers the phone one these days. - Meemaw, I know you probably don't want to hear this, but maybe it is a good time to consider selling. I mean, there's already an offer on the table and you can use the money for retirement. - You don't retire from something you love. This ranch has been in our family for generations. We made it through the depression in the '80s, we're gonna make it through this. - But I wouldn't put too much stock in Haleye. - Haleye's gonna help us figure this out. - Ugh. Haleye's so selfish. That's all it is. 'Cause she's got her big fancy city job and she doesn't call, she doesn't visit. She can care less about this place or how stressed it makes Charles. You know, I've worked here for almost three years and I've never even met her. And I'm talking to a horse. - Name? - It should be under Haleye. - Two? - Yes. - Is the rest of your party here? - No, I am a bit early. It's an online date, it's my first one in a while. - Oh. - Is that sad? - Kind of. I'll show you to your table. - Thank you. Oh, oh, we're a little far from the door, what if I have to make an escape? - Hilarious. Why don't you just sit at the bar until your party gets here. - Okay, thank you. Can I have a glass of white? - Yeah. - Charles, I'm on my first date in like over a year, I cannot talk right now. Thank you. I'll call you later. - Thank you. Oh my goodness, hi. - Hi. - You must be Haleye. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - Oh wow, your energy is just so great. - Oh. - Are you a Leo? - Pisces, but thank you. - Pisces, yes, I see it now. Oh, my energy reading has been so off this week. Don't you just hate that? It's like, how are you even supposed to function? Oh, the solstice has been crazy. - Yes, yes it has been. So Masonry, that is a really unique name. - Thank you. Yeah, I gave it to myself in a naming ceremony in Chile. - A naming ceremony? - Yeah. So I was there, you know, setting my intention for the new year and I kept feeling all this like weird burden. So my metaphysical advisor, Amy, was like, "You cannot thrive in this world "under the narcissistic shroud of your parental given name." So I go to this butterfly meditation yurt and release it and accepted my new name. - That sounds unbelievable. - It was. - So how did you choose Masonry? - Oh, I didn't choose it, the universe did. I just received it. - Oh, of course. So what do you do? - I exist. - No. I mean at like for work for a job. - I'm a student. - Oh that's cool, where? - Here. - Like the restaurant? - The world of course. - Of course. Does that pay well. - Money is a construct, but if I had to use it to understand the value of my worth, yes it does. I have over two million followers on Snap Back and I make about 200K a year on that. - I'm sorry, what? - Yeah, you should totally follow me, if you don't already. So Haleye, what do you do? - Oh, well I'm the vice president of operations at Mega Energy Drink. - But what do you do? - I manage corporate relationships, branding, marketing. - Right, but what do you do? - I like hiking. - Haleye, may I share my truth with you? - Yeah, sure. - I'm very much connecting with you on a human level, but not on a spiritual level and not at all on a physical level. With your permission of course, I would very much like to leave this interaction. Would you release me so that we can both continue on our journeys but like separately? - Yeah, of course. - Thank you. I am so grateful for what I'm learning from you. Good journey. - Good journey. - Exactly. Oh, and don't forget to follow me on Snap Back. I'm doing a chakra bracelet giveaway tomorrow. - One more. Charles, honestly. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't hang up. Listen, this is important. - Oh my God is everyone okay, is me Meemaw okay? You're supposed to text 911 if. - She's fine. Well kind of. Look, I mean, she really wants you home and we really need to talk about the ranch. - The ranch, what about it? - It's in trouble and things are getting really bad. - How is that possible, isn't superwoman Kate there to save everyone? - Listen, I don't really wanna talk about details on the phone, but can you please come home? Okay, just for a little bit. It's just to see if maybe you can help. - Look, I don't know, Charles, I have this big project and I. - Haleye, listen to me, Meemaw refunded us a few years ago to cover Papa's hospital expenses and yeah, it's caught up with this. Yeah, I've been trying to work it out with the bank, but so far, no luck. - Okay, well this is really bad timing. I have this huge presentation and I just. - Haleye, we have wifi here okay. I'm begging you. You haven't been back for a while and look, if we can't figure something out, we're gonna have to sell. - Well, okay yeah, I see, the guilt trip. - Well, okay. But you always did love Christmas at the ranch, right? - This'll be a massive, massive inconvenience for me. - So you're coming? - I'll have to work remotely of course. - You're coming. Yes, thank you. - Yes, I'll come. You're welcome. - Biggest place with the least amount of people. How am I ever gonna meet someone new here? Even if I did, what would I say? I mean, I only talk to horses and now myself apparently. Oh Kate, oh, this is sad. Listen, I don't wanna get all Mariah Carey on you or whatever, but all I want for Christmas this year is someone to share it with. And that's just between us. Okay. I just asked Santa Claus for a girlfriend. Yeah, I'm officially losing it. - Lauren. - Oh, hi Haleye. - Hey, I need to see Eric. - He isn't here, he's already in Arizona getting ready for the meetings. - Already, that was fast. Okay, so I have to go home for a family thing, but I will have my cell phone, I'll be checking email and I will be working remotely. - Cool. - And you will let Eric know? - Totally. - Okay well thank you, Lauren. Have a good weekend. - No, you did not. - Going somewhere? - Yeah, some hunters said there's a post broken down by the creek, so I'm gonna take a look, pick up some supplies on my way back. - All right, well, you can't do all that in one night. - I know that, I'll set up camp be back early in the morning. - Oh no, you can't stay outside overnight. - Sure I can, I do it all the time. Camping in the cold's one of my favorite things to do. - Well, I know, but I was a bad storm coming. - You really don't know how to read the weather, do you? It's coming in a few days. Look, I've got my cell phone and my fancy signal booster. - Yeah, look, could you, would you just please go to Fox Springs, check into the lodge. - Would that get you off my case? - Yes, if you check into the lodge. - All right fine, I'll check into the lodge. - Thank you. - Just trying to save some money. - Oh no, I don't believe this. - What's that vulture doing here? - Howdy. Heard you got a fence post down by the creek. Think that's pretty generous for me to still wanna buy the place, even if it is falling apart. - You slimy little. Get off my ranch. - What can I do for you, Bert? - Just thought I'd by and see if you need any help with the fence post, just be neighborly. - Well, Kate, here's just packing up to go down and fix it. So we're all good. - Her? She's going down to fix the fence all by herself? My frank won't be on the table forever, Charles, it's either me or the bank. And frankly, I'm a lot more generous. You need to make a decision soon. - We can't do anything until my sister gets here. It's a family decision. - Good. Maybe she can talk some sense into you. - We all done? - Yeah, we're good. Come on Junior, we still got work to do. Oh and Kate, when you get through at the Hayride, won't you come on over at our place and help us with ours. Merry Christmas. - All right, I'm heading out. - Text me when you get there. - Yeah. Hey, don't forget to move the cattle to the next pasture. - Yeah. - Before it gets dark. - Thank God Haleye is coming. Can't wait to see their faces when we tear up those contracts. - Yeah. - Okay yeah, no, I just got here so about to check in. Okay, yeah bye. - Need some help, hun? - No, thank you, I just need a room. The name is Haleye Hollis. - Oh my God, Haleye, Charlie's sister? - Yep, that's me. - Well, I'll be, it's me, Lucy Brenson. Well, Whyman now, I got married. Charlie and I went together for a while in high school. - Oh my God, Lucy. Yeah well. Oh my God, how are you? - I'm great. Three kids, that whole thing. Moved up here to Fox Springs about 10 years ago now. What can I say, I'm a city girl at heart. - Yeah that's great, this certainly is a city technically. - Now what have you been up to? I heard you went to Dart. - Dartmouth. Yeah, well now I live in San Francisco and I work in a tech company. - Oh wow, oh, that must be wonderful. I've always wanted to go to California. I love L.A. Oh, you must not be used to all this weather that we're having here. - No, I'm not. - No Palm trees and movie stars here. Although I did a few commercials for the mattress outlet, non-union. - Well, I think I'm just gonna head up and get some rest. - Oh sure. - Thank you, yeah. - I put you in the good room right next to the ice machine. - Oh, thank you. - You're very welcome. Well, enjoy your stay with us. - Thank you. - And Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - See ya. - Bye. Hey, yep, I just got here. Yep, okay. Yes, Charles, I'm just getting to my room now. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Good luck with the bank meeting. Okay, bye. - Hey Kate, I thought I might be seeing you here. Heard about that broken fence post down by the creek. I saved a spot in the barn from Molly. - I appreciate that. How's Walter and the kids? - Oh, they're good. Driving me to my absolute wits end, but good. You want your usual room? - That'd be great. - All right, here's your key. And the HBO's working tonight. - Great, thanks Luc. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Let's see what the scene is like in the big city. - Oh, Lucy, scandalous. No wonder you and Walter keep inviting me over for drinks. Very progressive, but no. Hello Joan. - Oh, hello Cowgirl. Not married, no kids. Less than a mile away. Cute dog. - Automatic swipe, right. - Yes, the hot cowgirl. - Whoa. That's never happened before. - That was quick. - Okay, you can do this. Hi. I like your dog. - Oh, hot cowgirl. I bet she can start a fire from nothing. Thanks. And what am I, chopped liver? - No, you're cute too. Sorry, I'm bad at this. - Everyone's bad at this. It's awkward. We seem to be relatively close. Maybe this would be better in person? Would you wanna grab a drink? Oh my God. - Oh he's bold. Do I wanna grab a drink? Of course I do. Joan's hot and I just talk to animals or myself, I guess really just to myself. Okay. Yes, I'd love to. The Wet Whistle is close. Do you wanna meet there? - Sounds lovely. 30 minutes? - Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing? Yes. - Oh. Oh my God. - Oh my God. - I have to get ready. - I have to get ready. I didn't bring anything with me. - Oh, make up, make up, make up. - What do I have, what do I have? I have ChapStick. Jesus, Kate ChapStick. Matches. Great. - Joan. - Hi, Cowgirl. - Hi. I'll have a beer please. - I'm not usually this bold asking someone to meet so soon. - Yeah, I'm not usually this bold in saying yes to meeting someone so soon. But I'm glad you did. I work with animals so I can go days without seeing another person. - Oh, that's cool, what do you do? - I work at a zoo. What do you do? - Oh, just boring business stuff, PowerPoints and social media. I didn't know there was zoo in Fox Springs. - Oh, there's not. I'm just traveling through, to see a horse for the zoo. I'm only here for a little bit. - I'm only here for a couple days too, so I guess it was good timing. - Yes, yeah. What are you in town for? - Just dumb family stuff I'd rather not talk about. - I understand dumb family stuff. - Oh. To dumb families. - To dumb families. - So Cowgirl, what's your real name? - Katherine. - Katherine. That's a pretty name for a pretty lady. Now, why did I do that? That was bad, wasn't it? - Yeah it kind of was. Oh, it was kinda cute. - Okay. - Just like you. That wasn't any better. - Oh, I'm so sorry, I have to take care of this. Oh crap. - I'm guessing everything's not okay. - No, it's it's an emergency. - Oh no. - I have to deal with this former social media director, who's gone rogue and is just posting. - Social media, that's an emergency? - Oh in my line of work it is. - Interesting line of work. - Look, I really, I want this and I want you, - But, it's a social media emergency. - It's a little bigger than that. See, we have this buyers meeting and if they say that we have a bad social media footprint. I'm not making this sound any better, am I? - Nope. I hope you fix it. - I am so sorry. - It's fine. It's nice to meet you Joan. - It's nice to meet you too. - The zoo, ah, Kate. - Haleye. Haleye Hollis? - Hi, can I help you? - I'm the Uber. - The Uber? - Your brother sent me. - Oh, sorry, yeah. I was up all night dealing with an emergency. - Oh gosh, I'm sorry, is everybody okay? - Oh yeah, it was a social media emergency. - Oh, that's a thing. - Oh, in my line of. Nevermind. You know, Walter? Okay, Walter, just gimme a minute and I'll meet you down there. - Yeah, yeah, no problem. - Thanks Walter. - I'll be in the truck. - Okay, sounds good. Thank you. - Yeah. - Okay. - Hey girl. - Hi Meemaw. - Look at you, sight for sore eyes. My Christmas present. - Aw, Meemaw, you're wearing your special earrings. - Yeah, Papa gave these to me. - Well, I've always loved them on you. - Hey Meemaw. - Haleye's here. - The prodigal child half returned. - Don't start. - Okay, I'm gonna go finish making lunch. - Come here. Good to have you back. - Thanks. - Let's get you settled in and grab some lunch, right. - All right, that sounds good. Oh, how'd the bank meeting go? - We'll talk about that later. - Okay. - Where you going? - I'm gonna go get settled and definitely shower. - Yeah, but you're staying in the house now. - Oh, no, thank you, I'll stay in the cottage. - I set up your old room. - You know, I don't like staying there. - All that therapy and you still can't stay in your old room? - Can, I just, I love the cottage, so I'll stay there, it's cozy. - Kate lives there. - Of course, the perfect ranch hand. She was never in place? - Well, no, she's been a big help around here. So no, she stays here. - Yeah, I know, you've only mentioned how great she is in every conversation we've had. - Yeah, well that's why it's so great to have you here. Come on. - Okay, I'm coming. - Come on dork. - I'm coming. - There she is. - Hi Meemaw. - Hey. - Bacon at lunch? - Yeah. Bacon's good at any meal, you know that. - Meemaw. How's your room? - It's good. - So the Cooper's goats got out. They chew through the fence and Charles had to go grab 'em. He's been gone a while. - A goat, okay, Meemaw, he is not good at this. - Well, you were always a better rancher than he was. Remember that time you, I think you were 10, and you found that calf with her head stuck through the fence. - Well it took me like an hour, right? - Yeah. - Maybe over. To calm her down enough to get her head back through. - Yeah. - Well, I'm here and I'm ready to help. - I'm so glad. Charles has been really stressed this last year. He thinks I don't notice, but I see it. Hey. There's our goat herder. - Oh man. Those things are faster than you'd think they'd be. - Oh, don't let it get your goat. You know, like go get your goat? - Oh yeah, I see what you did there. Okay. - Still got it. - Still got it. Thank you. Bacon, nice. I'm telling you, Kate's gonna have to mend that fence. I fixed it temporarily, but it's just not gonna hold. - Well, come on, everybody eat up. Haleye's ready to get started on things. - Okay. Let's get to it. This is where all the revenues come from. And these are all the expenses I've had to cut. - Wait, well, Christmas Hay Ride is down 60% from last year? Well that's what's killing you. You were growing each year from the Pumpkin Patch and the Hayride, and then this year. Well what's your marketing strategy? - I don't know, Kate could tell you more about that. - Kate? She's why there's lost revenue. - No, she's the reason revenues grown each year, except for this year. - Okay well, this is the only year that matters and it looks like she's a huge strain on the ranch. - No, no, no, no, no, no, she's not. - Right, you can start by cutting her and rent the cottage as an Airbnb. She's a huge expense. And if the Christmas Hayride is. - 60% down. - Hot cowgirl. - Yeah, the Berts are running their own Christmas Hayride to put us out of business, and it's working. - Kate, this is Haleye. - Joan? - Haleye. - Yes, it's Haleye, Haleye Joan Hollis. - Oh, you're Haleye. Haleye is your name? - And you're Katherine and you don't work at a zoo. - My friends call me Kate. There are animals here and people look at 'em. So should I call you Haleye Joan or is it just Haleye by itself? - Just Haleye. - You two know each other? - No. - No. - Okay, well good, Kate, you're just in time, 'cause Haleye and I were just starting to go over the ranch business. - Dumb family stuff? Yes, I heard, I'm an expensive line item. - Ah, well. - No, I only meant that. - Look, we've already had to cut a lot of people. Running the Hayride, moving the cattle to different pastures, animal emergencies in general upkeep with just two people is tough. - Yeah. - I was just looking at the numbers and the marketing. - Oh, I'm sure we can solve this with a little social media help. I mean, it's just some family stuff. - What are you saying that for? - Nothing. - Kate. Kate. What's that about? - Oh, what about? - Haleye didn't mean to suggest that we fire you. - Yes she did. - Okay, well that's obviously not gonna happen. You know, she's just stressed, like we all are. But I really need her to remember why she loves the ranch. I need her to come back more often. Meemaw really misses her. - I don't know why. - Well, could you please just try to get along, it's just for a few days. - Fine. But she needs to stay outta my way. There's a lot of work to do and I don't have time to babysit. - Okay, I'll make sure she stays outta your way. Just yeah, be nice. - I am nice. - Aha, yeah, no, yeah, not a problem. Okay, I just wanna give it one more look over Eric. - Great, we totally have interest, so let's move the numbers up by 20%. If this happens, you can retire early Hals. - Okay, well that is great news. I'll make those adjustments. I just have to redo all the slides. But I will get the presentation over to tomorrow. - Has to be tomorrow. - Eric, it will be. Oh Meemaw, you scared me. - I'm sorry. I just love seeing you sitting in that chair. How's it going? - Well, I'm trying to figure it out. But with the move to intense grazing, it's just so much more time. - Oh yeah. Kate and Charles have to, they have to move fencing every two days and we had to let Adam go, so it's just them. - And the Christmas Hayride revenue is down because of the Berts. - Yes, they started their own Hayride in town. And so folks just don't wanna drive as far as us anymore. - Bert Jr. is a total creep. And someone's made an offer to buy this place? - The Berts. But they're a couple of weasels, I'm not selling to 'em. - Okay, Meemaw, look, I get that but they've made a really solid offer. You could take this money and retire, buy place in Fox Springs, stop working so hard. - That sounds terrible. Honey, I love this place. And I love working with Kate and Charles. - But this is a really good deal. It's hard to pass up. - If I just not signed that loan. - You had to, to take care of Papa. - I know. I wanna give this ranch to you and Charles. Not everything's about money Haleye. - No, of course, I know that. - This is where your parents met, it's where they got married, it's where I met Papa. He came one year for the Christmas Hayride and he was standing on a bail of hay, and he looked so handsome. - You fell into his arms. - This is more than a business for us. - I'm not gonna give up. I will keep trying. - That's my girl. You know, you should go talk to Kate. She knows this place inside and out and she loves it. - She's not very fond of me. - Well you can win her over. Now the Hayride's starting in a few minutes, you should go. - I haven't rode the Hayride in forever. - Exactly. And she's done some really fun things with it. - Yeah, I bet she has. - Go. Come on. - Hi y'all, welcome to the Hollis Hills Christmas Hayride. There's some hot chocolate in the barn, if you wanna grab a cup, and we'll get headed out shortly. - Hot cocoa's a nice touch. - That's nothing. Of course the Berts stole our idea for their new Hayride. - Well, we can agree, they're snakes. - Yes they are. You going on the ride? Want a help up? - I can get on a buckboard by myself. - Okay. - Whoa. - The trailer shifted. - Yeah, they do that sometimes. - I'm gonna get some hot chocolate myself, so. - Okay. Careful. - I got it, thank you. - Merry Christmas. - That was fun. - Yeah. - The red nose looks good on you. - Oh. Thank you. - You really stepped things up. It used to be just a few colored lights on the trees and singing Christmas carols. But that was the next level. - Thank you. Yeah, it's been fun. Last year we did the Grinch theme. - Oh. Well you did a really great job for the final year. - Final year? - Well yeah, maybe. I mean I'm trying to say positive for Meemaw on Charles, but. - So that's it, you're just gonna give up. - Apparently I'm the only practical one here. Look, I have to make sure that my grandma has enough to retire and selling will make that happen. - And what about Charles? - Charles will be fine. He used to work in tech before he came here. So he can get a job anywhere. - But he loves the ranch. We should have done the Grinch theme again this year, we could have just used you. I gotta put this stuff away. - Presentation done. And send. Voila. - This right here is hot cocoa made from your Papa's world famous recipe. It is Kate's favorite, and I'd like you to take it to the cottage and extend an olive branch. - She hates me. - She doesn't know you. - She called me the Grinch. - It was just her worry talking. We all want the same thing. - To save the ranch. - Oh honey, it's more than that. It's what this place means to all of us. - Are you worried about losing the ranch? - Not really, no. - What if I don't figure it out? - You don't have to worry like this, honey. We just need to do what we can see to do, one step at a time. - I hope to have that one day. - You will. Now stop stalling. - I'm not stalling. - You're stalling. Take this out. - Well, where's my cup? - Come on. - All right. Just for you. - Okay, bye, bye. - Bye. - I come in peace with hot cocoa. - Are you nuts? It's freezing outside. And you came over here dressed like that? - Yeah. In retrospect it was a bad idea. - Oh my goodness, I can't believe you walked over here in this weather. - I brought hot cocoa. - Oh, well maybe I'll have to pour it all over you to warm you up, here. - Thank you. Meemaw said it's your favorite. - Oh, you city girls. I'll get us some cups. - What are you cooking? It smells amazing. - Oh deer stew. It's your Papa's recipe. - Meemaw gave you his recipe? - She did. Here, have some of your olive branch. - That's good. - So hold on, you walked over here in this weather, dressed like that, just to bring me hot chocolate. - Meemaw asked me to. She said you might be able to give me some insight on how to save this place. - That's hopeful of her. I don't think I can. I've looked at those numbers and that bank loan should be illegal. - I know. They need to sell, right? - I mean, I don't see any way around it. But I didn't go to Harvard or anything. - Dartmouth, but you don't need an Ivy League education to see how much trouble this place is in. - Well, Dartmouth, maybe if you got to know the ranch again, you'd come up with some great idea. - I went on the Hayride. - There's more to the ranch than just the Christmas Hayride. Look, you never know where inspirational come from. Besides I'm sure you could use a break from the city. - I like the city. - You know I'm right. - What is happening? - Power's out. - I can see that, why? - Snowstorm. - Do you have a generator? - A small one, enough to get the lights back on. It's fine. - Oh, I have no cell service. - Yeah, the tower's probably down, it's pretty typical. - Okay, so we're just stranded here with no power, no heat and no cell service. - It's fine, okay. It'll be fine. We'll call the house. See told you. Ranch Babe to Big Momma. - Ranch Babe? - This is Big Momma, go ahead Ranch Babe. - Just wanted to let y'all know that the power's out, but we're safe and sound. - All right, good. You got everything you need. - 10-4, generator kicked in, so we'll just wait the storm out. - 10-4 Ranch Babe. Call if you need something, over and out. - Problem solved. - Wow. - I did not pick my handle. - Sure you didn't. Now that smells just like I remember. - Wanna taste? - Thank you. - Want a cup? - Okay. Thank you. - Yes. - So, Ranch Babe. Let's try this whole getting to know you thing again. - Okay, fine. What would you like to know, Joan? - Well, since you don't work at a zoo, just tell me about yourself. - Oh, you wanna know about my dumb family stuff? - You know all about mine. - I'm originally from Kentucky, Lexington. My parents bread and raised horses. - Isn't there a lot of money in that? - Yes, and a lot of entitled rich kids trotting around one champion horses that they never have to brush or saddle. - Like the little helmets and riding pants and whips. - Yep, the whole deal. Private schools, pageants, lavish parties, disguised as charity fundraisers. - Kate, the rich princess. That does not seem like you. - It's not. I tried to be the perfect daughter for a while. - And what happened? - I love the horses and the work, but not the pretentious people. My parents wanted a junior league beauty queen and I just wanted to be a cowgirl and date the other princesses. - Ah. - Their money, their rules. I couldn't do it. Anyway, so I left. - So you haven't talked to your family at all? - No, but I haven't really tried. I mean, we got into a huge fight before I left. We're all too stubborn to pick up the phone. - You're too stubborn, you? Sorry, that's really tough. - Yeah, what about you? What was the teenage Haleye like? - Well, I spent a lot of years being a sullen teenager. - Really? I've seen some pictures of you and your parents enjoying the ranch. - I did. But that was a long time ago. Well, I'm gonna head back to the house, but thank you, thank you for the stew and for warming me up. - You shouldn't leave. The storm, you should just crash here tonight. - Oh no, well look, I walked here, I can walk back. It's easy, don't worry. - All right. - Goodnight. I'm gonna need pajamas. How's it going over there? - Fine yeah just super comfortable. - Well, you sure are moving around a lot. - It's fine, just trying to get situated that's all. - Okay, well I'm not gonna be able to sleep if you're gonna be tossing and turning all night. - Well, I just, look, I've never really slept with people here, so it's fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Okay well, now I feel bad that I took your bed. Just get up here, this is silly. - Well, I feel bad that you feel bad. - Well then come on, if you're not gonna do it for your own comfort, can you just do it so we can both get to sleep? - Fine. Well, I don't know, maybe if we sleep back to back. Can you just scooch in? - No. - I don't sleep next to the wall. - Well, me too. - Sorry. - Okay. - Excuse me. Can you just share the blanket. - Gosh, just trying to get comfortable, okay. - Okay, now you're, can you not dig your arm in my back? - All right sorry. I didn't mean to, just not used to sleeping to the wall. - You good? - No. - Now I am. I think we're in. - It's toasty. - Yeah, it's kinda nice, right? - Yeah, it is kinda nice. - I mean we're warm and we're not freezing and I'm not sleeping on the floor, so. - Yeah, no, that part, that part's nice. - Yeah, there's that. - Goodnight Kate. - Goodnight Haleye. - You two alive in there? - Oh. Yeah, we're fine. Just a second. Ah, ow. Hi. - Good morning. - Morning. - Never seen you asleep this late before. - Yeah, I guess it must have been really out. - Well, glad to see you two found a way to keep warm. Well I brought you some fresh coffee and fresh peach scones. - Coffee, please thank you. - So what is it that you plan on getting into today? - Actually, well, I was thinking that maybe I could tag along with Kate today and get to know the ranch. - You're gonna ride out with Kate? - Oh yeah, you never know where inspiration can come from. - Huh. You okay with that? - Huh? Oh yeah, I'll take care of her. - Okay. Stay warm out there today. It's cold today. - Yeah. - Have a good day. - All right, you too. I bet you didn't bring any riding clothes, did you? - Nope. I bet you can start a fire from nothing. - What? - Oh, I just like, I used to know this girl who said she wanted a husband who could build a fire from nothing. - Well, you can't build a fire from nothing. - No, I mean like you could just find stuff and make a fire. I don't know, I guess it made her feel like she could be with someone who could take care of her in dire circumstances. - Yeah, well that's dumb. I mean, I can start a fire from nothing, but I would never put in a position where I would have to. Here, you can use my riding gear. Coffee. - Thank you. - Now Bucky, this is Haleye, she's gonna ride you today. So you be nice. - You're giving me horse named Bucky? - Yeah. She doesn't know what it means. - But she understood what you just said to her. - Probably not. Okay. - Okay, look, I'm not a total amateur. - Oh, okay, I'm sorry, by all means. - Well, I haven't been to Pilates in over a week, what do you expect? - Yeah, that's totally it. You know, there's no shame in using the stool, Haleye. There's nobody here to impress. - Okay, well I'm not trying to impress you. - Good, 'cause you're definitely not. - Okay, fine, I'll use the stool. Thank you. It's just the clothes, they're limiting my range of motion. - Totally. You good? - Yes, thank you. - All right then here we go. - All right Bucky. - My favorite tree, we call her the Grand Oak. - It's my favorite tree too. - I wanna show you something. - What is it? - It's a surprise. - A surprise out here, is it a Starbucks? - I found it a few years ago, let's see. Ah here, there it is. - Meemaw and Papa's initials, wow. - And check this one out. - My mom and dad. I have to go. - Haleye wait. - Hey. - There's no saving it. We have to sell. Like I've been through this a million times and, it's just, it is crazy and it's reckless to try to save this place. - This is our home, Haleye. - That's the problem. That's the problem. You keep putting all this sentimental value on a business. You can't see what it's so obviously clear to anybody with a calculator. - This is our family home. And once they died, this was your home too. - And this was never my home. You love this place, I get that. But I don't belong here. - You know that you do. look, you loved this place once, right, and I think that you belong here just as much as. - I don't know where I belong. Maybe I don't belong anywhere. - No, you know, that's not true. You know you belong here with us. Okay, hey, we're your family. - I don't know what to say. How old were you? - Oh, here. I'm not sure. - No, I mean, when they, the car accident. - They died three weeks before my 13th birthday. - I bet high school was tough. - It was. And I thought that leaving this place would fix everything. - Did it? - No, that took thousands of dollars of therapy. - Oh well you're totally fine then. - Yeah. - I don't think you really hate it here. - Tell that to my brother. - I think you love it, but it reminds you of your parents and that's painful. And you don't come around because it reminds you of them. - You don't know me, Kate. That girl had her parents. - Hey. Look, I know there's a lot of pain for you here. That's understandable. But there's joy too. - That's a great speech, Kate. Maybe you should take your own advice. - We're not talking about me. - Well, let's talk about you. Because you can stand there and you can judge my life and my choices, but you're too stubborn to call your own family. - Listen, that's different. - Yes, yes it is 'cause you still have family to call and they may not be perfect, but they're still alive and you can just try to talk to them. I can't, I can never tell them how much I love them or if my dating life sucks or if I'm even in love. They're gone. Steve, hey, I need a flight out, right now. - That's impossible, Haleye. It's not like a major airport. Best I can do with tomorrow afternoon. - Okay just, fine, whatever. Just can you just get me outta here as soon as possible? - You okay? - Yeah, just dumb family stuff. Can you just send me the details when you have them please? Thank you. - Family meeting. - Okay. - So honey, Charles told me what you said last night. And I know you tried so hard. So we're gonna take your advice and sell to Bert. - I'm sorry Meemaw, I'm sorry. - No, it's not your fault, not your fault. - Wait, where's Kate? - Kate? - Well, I mean, yeah, isn't she a part of this too? - Yeah, she left early this morning for town. - Oh. - You know, I was thinking, that maybe I could come back for Christmas, last one at the ranch. - That would be so nice. I'm so glad you came. I still believe in you Haleye. - Okay. - Okay, yeah. - Sorry, I couldn't figure anything out. - I'm really glad you came home. - Well, I miss Meemaw and you. - Well, yeah, then you should come home more often. - I will. But just because I realized that maybe I do have a little cowgirl in me. - Yeah. - More than I thought. - I bet. - So what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I don't think my goat herding career is off to a great start, so we'll see. - Yeah, we can agree on that. - But after we get things settled here, then I'll decide. We lost a whole lot, but we still have a whole lot. - Love you dork. - I love you dork. - Hey. Heard anything from Eric? - No, no, he's been in meetings since I got back. - That's a good sign, right? - Maybe. Speak of the devil. Eric wants me upstairs immediately. - Ah, moment of truth. You got this. - Knock on wood, knock on wood. - Knock on wood, manifest. - Bye. - Bye. - Come on in. Look at it Hals, whole stuffy universe. Hals, we sold. - Wait, wait, wait, no we, you're not joking, right, we did? - We did. And this is for you. - Oh my God. - I know right. But you earned it. We all totally earned it, you know. Your presentation really sealed the deal. - This is amazing. - Right on, consensual hugging. - Thank you. - Yeah. I mean the retreat was a dud, so you really saved us. - The retreat was a dud? I thought that was a great idea. - Right, me too. When we got there, it was all like brunches and parties, champagne, just constant pampering. - And that was bad? - Yeah, I wanted to rough it. Sleep under the stars, rope cows, like ride horses, tough guy stuff you know. Like just rugged man bonding. Like, "Brokeback Mountain" you know." - Eric, have you actually seen "Brokeback Mountain?" - Just the first half. But it looked really cool, just some macho guys out in the wilderness becoming best friends. - Yeah. - Oh, oh, there was one part that was actually really cool. They brought in this energy healer and she did this like Chilean butterfly naming party or something. - Oh you mean like an a naming ceremony? - Yeah. - Wait, Masonry? - Masonry, yeah, yeah, you heard of her? She's amazing. That was the first time I felt truly connected, just out there by the fire with the sounds of nature, you know. No screens, no distractions, just nothing. - Yeah, I do know. I actually know exactly what you mean. So did the universe give you a name? - Totally. - Oh. - And it was? - Eric. I know, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, that was, I really felt my own power that night. - Oh yeah, right of course. - Yeah. - Anyway, Masonry, she's like a genius. She's got like three million Snap Back followers. Oh, oh dude, dude, if you stay, you should bring her on to do some social media stuff. - Stay? - Yeah, with that check, you don't have to work here anymore, if you don't want to, you can do whatever you want. - Yeah, yeah, I guess. Wait, oh my God, oh my God. Eric, you're right, you're right. Genius. - Well, everything we discussed is in here. - Lawyers made all the changes yesterday. All you gotta do is get your Meemaw to sign her name. Then I take it to my lawyers this afternoon, before they close today. - Where's Kate? - We still have Christmas Hayrides. - Not for long. - You can't take away our Christmas spirit. No, we're gonna continue doing these Hayrides for the joy of the season until, until we have to leave. All right, Bert, let's go have her sign 'em. - Thank you, Charlie. I'll give you all to the end of the year to vacate, my Christmas gift to you. - You're a real Santa Claus. - Here she comes. - I don't know who that is with her. - Whoa, that's what I wanted to see. - What do you think you're doing? - We're not selling. - Haleye, the environment. - Oh, I'm sorry Masonry, I was going for like, you know a thing. - But Haleye really, what are you doing? And who is that? - That is our new energy healer and social media director. - Your whata? - Oh, I'm sorry, Bert, this doesn't concern you since you don't own this place. And as of this moment, you're officially trespassing. - Tell that to the bank, honey. - Oh, well I just did. See, I went there first and I settled all of our debt and I went to the lawyer's office. They should be contacting you shortly. Meemaw, would you do the honors? - Yeah. - Bert and mini Bert get off my ranch. - This isn't over. - Oh yes it is, honey. - Bye. Did you really pay the bank back? - Yep, we're debt free. - How'd you get the money? - Remember that huge presentation I was working on? - Yeah. - Well it paid off. - Wow, you didn't have to do that. - No, I know I didn't have to, I wanted to. I love this place and I belong here. - Yes you do. - It's so good to have you back here. Really, who is that? - Right. - Okay, let's be honest, you are not great at this whole ranching thing. But you are great at, you know, operations, numbers. And if we just have enough of a ranch experience, we can make this place really profitable. And I have an idea for that. - You're right, Haleye, it's perfect. The energy surrounding this place is like a feminine power goddess. I can feel it everywhere. - There have been some really powerful women who've come through here. - Really, who is this? - I'm Masonry. Wow, you are so authentic. - Thank you. Listen, why don't you come with me and we'll go make a peach pie to celebrate. - Oh my God. Peaches are my lunar cycle fruit. - Oh, even better, come on. - Haleye, really? - Yep, yep. It was a blind date. - Okay, so what is this big idea? - Hollis Hills Outdoor Ranch Experience. Give overworked city slickers like me a break from the smog in their screens. They can come here, they can ride horses, play cowboy and reconnect with nature. - Ah, that is a really good idea. - I know. - Well does that mean you're gonna come back then? - Well, I can't let you do all the ranching. - Oh good. Woo. Come here. It's gonna be so good to have you back. And Kate's gonna love having you here too. - Wait, Kate, where is she? - She's getting the Hayrides ready. - I have an idea. - Oh, okay. What do I do with Masonry? - Whoa, your energy is like, wow. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Bye. Yes. Yes. You came back. - Just swoop in at the very last second to save the day. - What do you mean? - The ranch, we're debt free. - Really? - Yeah. - I took your advice and I called my parents. - Oh yeah, how did it go? - It went really well. You were right. I haven't stopped thinking about you. - Me too. Me thinking about you, not me thinking about myself. 'Cause if I thought of myself, I would be really weird. - Haleye. - Yeah. - This the part where you stop talking and kiss me. - I love this part.
