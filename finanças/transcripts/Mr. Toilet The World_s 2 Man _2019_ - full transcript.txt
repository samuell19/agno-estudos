Do you like my costume? Yes, we do. The back part is for flushing. 100, 200 rupees a month. No. This is very smelly. Boys do there. Girls do there. It's a very big problem. When girls go out for defecation, many men look at them with an evil intent. Can I try? Jack is a dreamer. Just based on my contact with him, his interests and this particular issue, I think he's quite a quirky person. I support his movement but to me, frankly, the task for Jack is too big. Let's take the case of India for example. It's a huge country. One billion people with a very different culture, different bureaucracy. Is this the most important issue for them? The answer is no. - How much is that shit pillow? - Ten dollars. The color is the same as your shirt. My advice would be look beyond the toilet. Maybe start with Singapore. And find out where can he make a difference. Why do you want to make a giraffe on public property? Our school facility is ranked first in our county. From every angle our school looks pretty good. Except for the toilet. There are 12 people in one dorm, so about a few hundred people live here total. Over 400 people share six toilets. - So dirty. - Look. Look. Look. - So many of them. - Yes. How did you feel when you cleaned the toilet for the first time? Terrifying. It made me vomit. The black stuff is worm eggs. What does your dream toilet look like? It should be clean. More convenient. So will you try to convince your parents to build a new toilet? No. Why? We don't need to waste lots of money on just a toilet. Do your families have cell phones? Yes. You didn't have cell phones before, right? Where does the money come from? The times have changed. You need to have a cell phone to keep up. People's minds are very strange. If you feel that you must have it, then you can have it. When you're unhappy and you go to the toilet, you'll be happy when you come out, right? Every day you should go hug your toilets on Valentine's Day. The relationship between us and toilets is so close. There is nothing else that has such a close relationship with you. Why don't we want to talk about the toilet? Because the topic of toilet is embarrassing. It doesn't sound like a nice thing, right? Poop... So this has been ignored for a very long time. In 2019, it will be the 150th birthday anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation closest to his heart. People were surprised that it was a job for a prime minister. But for me, cleaning is a very important job. He was troublesome for many civil servants. They found him very troublesome that you know, they said this stupid idea of his he was pushing and pushing and we had no time for him. How did you convince the Singapore government to see me? The ball and the poo-poo blend together and get to the vertical dryers. The hot air get from the solar panels and the high temperatures will yield fertilizers. It's very simple. Making people smile. Changing your lifestyle. Smile with me. Laugh with me. Make the world happy. There's no need to expose yourself more. Have the privacy that you wished for. In the day or night, Sulabh gives me light. I invented a toilet in 1970. And because of that today , India can think of stopping defecation in the open. Thank you, thank you. You will also get one day. Jack is a very good man, doing a good job. And he's humorous, so when he speaks, he speaks about sanitation in an interesting manner. But toilet cannot be a sexy thing. To which toilet do you say it's a sexy toilet? The question is how much the total cost? How much the total cost? I'm just asking question. What is the total cost of a toilet? How much does it cost? Six thousand dollars. - Six thousand? - Dollars. Wow, that's a lot. In India, the poor, they have half a dollar income per day. And if you ask them to have a toilet of six thousand dollars, and so difficult to operate, so many gadgets, it's impossible. We feel uncomfortable when men go there. So we have to wait for them to go away. When men are nearby, we have to go 30 minutes farther. We ladies are suffering a lot. We can't go to the toilet in public, mainly during our periods. They asked us to pay 5,000 rupees ($70 dollars) to construct a toilet. My daughter died of jaundice and we got into debt. So we said we cannot construct it and they left us. They said, "You build it and we'll pay you later." But we can't afford it. We won't be able to get a loan, we are workers. All of us would build toilets if someone finances us. If you get toilets built, we will worship you, the ladies as well. We would put up a billboard with your picture. You came to meet us first. If you build toilets for us we'd worship you. Those people, they might come and go. But you are here. See, like that. No, no. It would be in the village center. Many of us are facing great difficulty. The sooner the toilets are built, the better. We would take your pictures and celebrate. In Andhra Pradesh the biggest problem is that government has very limited funds. They are expecting a lot from us but our capacity to deliver without funds was quite limited. We need resources because India is such a huge landscape with so much variety and difference in culture. Kumbh Mela is the world's biggest fair. Every 12 years, they come from every corner of the Earth for their faith. The Kumbh Mela can create history because this is the first Mela with a message. Clean revolution. 600 million people in India need toilets. So this is a great opportunity to bring a change. Look at my costume. It is a toilet. It's a very good thing that everybody has done here at the Shipra River during Kumbh Mela today. All of you have taken a pledge. We believe that everybody should stick to it, that we will not pollute our river and nobody will defecate in the open. We will fulfill all these dreams. Please share your support by clapping. How do we get him to let Jack talk? Cause Jack's been trying to talk. Here is not the place. To empower the country, to sanitize the rivers Laugh! And now, our other very revered guest here today, Dr. Jack Sim. Indian society is so rigid culturally that had I made only jokes then what would happen? Nothing. A Brahmin in India, in society his position is very high. The son of a Brahmin will be a Brahmin. But an Untouchable, in this society their positions are lowest among the low. They have been cleaning toilets for 5,000 years. There is no chance of escape. I used to pick up shit here. In the rainy season, it was more problematic. We used to carry a bucket full of shit on our heads. And when it rained, it would drip all over us. Nobody can think of their emotions, their humiliations. Gandhi said, "I want clean India first and independence later on." So I cleaned toilets myself, just to feel the pain of Untouchables. It's totally impossible to describe. My whole body was full of "night soil". They asked me, "What are you doing?" "A Brahmin cleaning toilets?" My father-in-law was very, very angry with me. He said to me, "I don't want to see your face". I said, "Look, sanitation ranks number one in my life. Even my wife and children are second and third." The problem is that you are building a toilet just for a target. But culture takes time to change. From 5,000 years, we've been telling Indians not to defecate near their own habitation. And now you say, "You must have a toilet inside the house." Either you build toilets yourself or it will take a hundred years more. How many toilets do you need? At least a million. Jack thinks so big that sometimes we laugh at it. If you don't stop him, he's just like a train. He'll just go on and on. One day he's at some festival and then he's ended up with some Bollywood star. How do you then say, "Jack, I don't need more ideas. I just need you to do the project". What is that? India is the most important project WTO has done. The media has covered us, the newspaper, the television. So we need results. Not just hot air. But he said for rural, it's Mr. Kishu. I don't remember. I have given you the list of chosen people. That's good, but I don't remember. It will take another one week or so, so that the in-charge arrangements will be made. Jack Sim has come all the way from Singapore. Jack, if you have any issue, just speak to me. I will direct a consulate person to be in touch with you. Before we proceed further, we should have clarity. We will show it to the chief minister, take the approval, and we will proceed with fastness. I was appointed co-convener. I'm supposed to understand the strategic overview to advise to you what is the different gaps. - Jack, we will talk one day. - But I have no information. That is not correct. Okay. Jack Sim is in the beginning of the beginning. God said bless him to be a successful person. But you cannot compare the WTO and Sulabh at this stage. After 30 years or 40 years it can be compared. Who will win. How many of you are without toilets? I am planning, it might not be successful, but I am trying to approach many millionaires and billionaires to choose one district in India, and make a district free from open defecation. Every house will have a toilet. I assure you. It is not a promise by others, a promise by me. Donald Trump is the president of America. You can say the entire world. America is the strongest country. So I thought why not put his name and that will attract people throughout the world. Awareness has been created that sanitation is the biggest priority. And this has gone around the world. Now we want positive story. But for foreigners, it is difficult to understand. "So what is this story you have brought from India?" That blame will come on me. But I feel happy because if you want to think about others then you cannot go ahead. You think about yourself. You are doing right thing? Go ahead. In India, the problem is he got carried away. He wanted to do too much. And we wasted too much time, too much resources. And in fact I reach a point where I say I think we are quite tired of your ideas. Hello. - Do you remember me? - Yeah, I do. - You don't remember? - Yes, I do remember. - Do you all remember me? - Of course! Let's have a look at the toilets. Feces was burnt here before, right? It used to be here. - It is pretty, isn't it? - Yes, that is right. There was one time that we were at the gym and the toilet was under construction. There were so many students. We were not allowed to enter, so we snuck in to see the new restroom. Many students snuck in. They took a peek and ran away. They were all shocked. They said "Wow, this is so fancy". When my parents came to my school, they saw the new restroom. When they came back home, they kept talking about it for two days. Thank you for all the support you have given us. We will study hard and not let you down. Thank you. I wish you a lifetime of happiness. Thank you for the new bathroom. Thank you. If we build good toilets in this school, other schools will envy our accomplishments. What's more if China does well, other countries will follow. Yes. Sometimes we think that we are normal people who are incapable of great things. But the truth is that we are capable of influencing thousands through word of mouth, one person at a time. - These are... - Superheroes. Superheroes. Will you come back or not? We can stay in touch. Okay. Then in the future, we can be friends forever. - Right. - Good idea. When I die in twenty years, you won't be able to find me anymore. That won't happen You'll always be remembered in our hearts. Did you write that to Faith? For me and Jack, the purpose is the same: to make India free from open defecation. Certainly he will have to face some problems. But he can do it. He can get help from the people. He may be defeated. He may be insulted, humiliated sometimes. But if he accepts all these things, then nothing can defeat him.
