THAT IS TRUE. >> LIVE OFF WHAT WE FIND? >> YEAH, THINGS AROUND. YOU KNOW, BITS OF ROAD KILL AND STUFF. >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IS THAT IN ANCIENT -- WELL, IN ROMAN BRITAIN, THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS AN ENORMOUS AND MAGNIFICENT EMPIRE. IT WAS MIGHTY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. BUT LIKE ALL THINGS, IT CAME TO AN END. AND AS IT STARTED TO COME TO AN END IN BRITAIN, AS ITS POWER STARTED TO DWINDLE, OPPORTUNISTS SAW -- >> SPEAK UP A BIT MATE. SPEAK UP A LITTLE. >> RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO TURN THE RADIO DOWN. >> JUST FOR THE FILM, GUS. YOU'VE GOT TO SPEAK UP FOR THIS YouTube VIDEO. JUST TO PROVE IT WAS A REAL PUB.

I'VE GOT THIS ONE, WHICH IS AN IMPROVED VERSION. IT'S THE LASER. >> WHAT'S IT CALLED? >> IT'S CALLED A LASER. >> LASER? >> YEAH. >> TURN IT ROUND, THERE, TOWARDS ME. >> IT'S ONE OF THE NEWEST ONES. IT'S KIND OF, LIKE, BASED ON THE ORIGINAL CORTES, WHICH IS A VERY, VERY SOLID METAL DETECTOR. YOU GET THE SAME DEPTH AND SENSITIVITY. AND ALSO, IT'S A PICK UP AND GO. SO, LITERALLY, YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND GET GOING. IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR THE BEGINNER, BUT IT'S ALSO APPRECIATED BY THOSE OF US WHO ARE A LITTLE MORE SEASONED. WE'RE LOOKING FOR... >> I'M NOT SEASONED. >> WELL, NO. THAT THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT THIS ONE. YOU'VE GOT THIS ONE HERE. SO, EFFECTIVELY, THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE USING TODAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO KEEP THE COIL DOWN AGAINST THE GROUND AT ALL TIMES, MOVING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS LIKE THIS... >> OKAY. >> ...IN A CIRCLE AS YOU GO FORWARD. NOW -- >> THAT'LL PROBABLY DO, MATE. JUST A GENERAL INTRODUCTION WILL DO, TO BE HONEST. >> YEAH BUT... >> THAT'S BEEN CIRCLING US FOR AGES.

UNDER THE GOB? >> I DIDN'T KISS YOU. ANYWAY, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. >> YOU WEREN'T EVEN THAT DRUNK, AS I REMEMBER. >> YEAH, I WAS. I CLEARLY WAS DRUNK, ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE KISSED YOU. I DIDN'T KISS YOU. ANYWAY, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. DIDN'T HAPPEN. DIDN'T HAPPEN! >> YOU WEREN'T THAT DRUNK. >> LA, LA, LA, LA, LA! IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. STOP INSULTING MY BOYFRIEND. >> NOT INSULTING HIM. >> YEAH, YOU ARE. >> IT'S A COMPLIMENT. >> YOU'RE JUST CALLING HIM OUT. WHY CALL HIM OUT? >> WHY IS IT NOT A COMPLIMENT TO CALL HIM SOLDIER BOY? >> 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY. >> I WONDER WHAT HE'S -- I WONDER IF HE MIGHT KNEEL ON A LAND MINE OR SOMETHING. COULD BE DANGEROUS KNEELING ON A LAND MINE. >> JAKE, THAT IS NOT FUNNY. >> WAIT, SAL. >> SO, THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED. DID YOU GET THE OTHER ONE WITH THE -- >> YEAH. >> WELL, WHOSE LAND IS IT? IS IT THAT BLOODY MR. WHITE? >> NO, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. LIKE, WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHOSE LAND IT IS. AND I'VE TRIED EVERY METHOD THERE IS. >> WELL, YEAH, WE HAVE. >> WELL, IF YOU DO AN INTERNET SEARCH ON THE RENDLESHAM FOREST INCIDENT, 1980, THERE'S SHIT LOADS OF STUFF ABOUT IT. IT'S A WORLD-FAMOUS EVENT. >> YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF IT, BUT... >> THEY SAID PEOPLE WERE FREAKING OUT. ANIMALS WERE GOING NUTS, RIGHT? AND SCREAMING SOUNDS THEY COULDN'T ACCOUNT FOR. BUT NOW YOU'RE TALKING BUNK. 'CAUSE THERE'S FILES, MATE. IT'S DE-CLASSIFIED FILES, RIGHT, FROM -- >> YEAH, BUT WHERE'S THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE? FROM THE ACTUAL -- >> WELL, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE, THE MILITARY PEOPLE. >> YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SAY "THIS IS FROM THAT INCIDENT," HAVE THAT GOT ANY FOOTAGE? HAVE THEY GOT ANY -- >> YEAH, THEY -- THERE'S AUDIO RECORDINGS. THEY'VE GOT AUDIO RECORDINGS. >> YEAH. THAT'S ALL MESSING ABOUT, ISN'T IT? >> GO ON, THEN. THERE'S AUDIO RECORDINGS OF MILITARY GUYS OR WHATEVER GOING UP TO THE CRAFT. I MEAN, YOU CAN EITHER DENY THIS STUFF, MATE, OR YOU CAN DO A BIT OF RESEARCH, LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. >> WELL, YEAH, BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE. >> SAL, STOP FILMING ME. >> THERE'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF IT, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE DAY. IT'S OPEN TO GREAT SUSPICION WITH REGARDS TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY A HOAXER. I MEAN, THIS ISN'T -- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UFOs AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HOAXERS DO. THEY LOVE THAT STUFF, BECAUSE IT CREATES A REALLY BIG PUZZLE. >> NO OFFENSE, MATE, BUT YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY, MATE, YOU AIN'T GONNA BELIEVE IT UNTIL YOU'VE GOT ABDUCTED AND THEY GOT AN ANAL PROBE UP YOUR ASS. >> HE NEVER BELIEVES ANYTHING. >> MR. WHITE? >> I DON'T USUALLY BOTHER WITH IT, THOUGH. >> WELL, WE NEED TO TRY. MR. WHITE? >> PROBABLY UPSTAIRS ADJUSTING HIS WIFE'S BLOODY UNDERWEAR. >> LOOK, HE KNOWS WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE. I TOLD HIM WE'RE GOING TO TURN UP. >> IT'S BETTER TO ASK FORGIVENESS THAN PERMISSION. THAT'S WHAT I SAY. >> YOU'RE GOING TO GET US INTO TROUBLE. >> DID WARN YOU, SAL, IT COULD GO DOWN TO THE WOODS TODAY. >> LOOK. >> WHAT'S THAT? QUICK LOOK AT THAT. SLOW DOWN. >> JESUS. >> THAT'S NOT A SIGHT YOU SEE EVERY DAY. WHAT IS THAT? >> HORSEY. >> I'M HERE TO DIG UP SACKS OF GOLD. I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOME DEAD HORSES STOP ME. >> 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE MAN. >> CAN'T JUST BLOODY GO ON PRIVATE LAND AND START... >> ARE YOU SCARED? >> ...PICKING STUFF UP, MAN. HUH? >> ARE YOU SCARED? >> NOBODY'S SCARED. BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING, YOU GOT TO, YOU KNOW... >> YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE SCARED, WE CAN ALWAYS DROP YOU OFF AT A PUB. >> ALL RIGHT. WELL, LISTEN... >> HERE WE ARE IN RENDLESHAM FOREST. JUST WAITING FOR IT TO GET DARK, DO A BIT OF NIGHTHAWKING. >> WELL, TECHNICALLY, IT IS AT NIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, AS THE WORD SUGGESTS. BUT IT'S DOING METAL DETECTING ON LAND YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO BE ON. WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TONIGHT. I MEAN WE HAVE TRIED, BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT PERMISSION SO TECHNICALLY WE ARE NIGHTHAWKING, WHICH ISN'T ENTIRELY LEGAL. SO THE PLAN IS TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS DARK, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE'S AROUND. AND IN THE MEANTIME I'M GOING TO HAVE A KIP, AS IT'S BEEN A LONG DRIVE AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN EVEN LONGER NIGHT. BUT A GOOD ONE. >> WHERE ARE YOU GOING? >> HELLO? WHOA! >> GOT A MESSAGE FOR JAKE.
