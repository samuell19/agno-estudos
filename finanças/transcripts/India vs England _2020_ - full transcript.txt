I couldn’t bear to see her parents’ suffering. Teenagers are on the wrong path in this country. Is it only happening here? It’s like this in India too. Teenagers are the same everywhere. Where is Nisha? Not like she tells me before she goes. It’s been two days. You’re always busy with the activities of the Kannada Association. You’re always preaching about Indian culture but don’t have time to guide your own daughter. That’s not fair, you know. If I had been busy with a job like you, imagine what would have happened? You have no respect for housewives. I am the reason our kids can even speak some Kannada. Mahalakshmi’s kids don’t even know that much. Nisha isn’t picking my calls. Who knows where she is. I’ll teach her a lesson today. Raghu! Raghu, please control. Nisha! Any questions? “Where did you go? What were you doing?” Something like that? Okay, I’ll only tell you. The other night, we all did graffiti art in the tunnel. It was fun. Liberated expression of the liberated mind. The whole night? With those guys? There were girls too. The police chased us. But we escaped. Nisha, the path you’re on isn’t right. You should always remember we are part of Indian culture. Then why did you leave India? How can you enforce what you don't follow? Nisha, enough! It’s been three days since you left home. Anna is gone for months, why don’t you ask him? Because he’s a boy. You first need to stop hanging out with those British guys! But you are fine with him dating British girls, right? You’re making a big mistake, Nisha. I love my mistakes. And I want to learn from my own mistakes.

I’m Kanishka, a passionate Indian and Kannadiga. I am a nomad. I travel the world. I explore cultures and talk about the language, food and lifestyle of the people. To follow my work, subscribe to my YouTube channel, Kanishka on Wheels. We've all tried Vidyarthi Bhavan's dosa in Bengaluru. We’ve heard of V V Puram Food Street. Now I’m in a similar Food Street in a Welsh neighbourhood. A special thing that’s catching my attention is the Welsh Italian Pizza. Sounds like a great combo, doesn’t it? Nathan and Steve, the chefs of the delicious Italian Welsh pizza. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Today we’re auctioning a rare and precious diamond. It originated in India and it belonged to Trinethra temple. The diamond is not just an ordinary piece of stone, but a priceless jewel with brilliant cut and clarity, which has a rich heritage and history. The priest of the temple gifted the diamond to a high-ranking British officer. Today, whoever wins the diamond in the auction, will take back a piece of history with them. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the biggest, rarest, most precious, 110 carat, divine diamond ever, the Great Blue Diamond. Right, the bidding will start today at £10 million. We’ll increase the bids in increments of half a million. So, looking for a bid now for £10.5 million, anywhere? £10.5 million? £15 million! £15 million! Thank you very much indeed! Now £15 million. So we’re £15 million going once, £15 million going twice, final call on £15 million, thrice! Gone! Sold for £15 million to Mr. Felix Dickens. Thank you very much, sir. Well done. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m so excited about winning this auction today. As most of you know, I am an avid collector of rare antiquities. I find great joy in adding this brilliant diamond to part of my collection. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hello, Felix! How are you? I’m good, I’m good. Congratulations! Thank you. See you later. The country I’m visiting next is known for its cultural values and yes, it’s close to my heart. Hey! Hey! Stop! Aren’t you going to apologise? What? Hey, hey, hey. What are you staring at? Now’s not the time, come on Aren’t you going to apologise? -Come on. Let’s go, let’s go. I’m sorry, okay. I have to go. Go, go, go! Bloody morons. Harry, you need to give us more money. That item is worth £15 million. That’s more than anything we’ve done for you before. I don’t keep anybody’s dues. I will pay with interest. That is my principle. No! No! I have zero tolerance for errors. Understand? Let’s go. Go, go! Hello, Felix. Congratulations. I see you’re all over the news. Oh, thanks Doc! I tell you what, this is the first gem in my Indian collection. Don’t worry Felix, I’m sure you’ll have more antiques from India in your collection soon. By the way, how is your health? I hope you’re not neglecting it in the middle of all your busy activities. I tell you what, I feel a hundred times younger. No high blood pressure, no sugar. Well, that’s good to hear, Felix. But, don’t forget to take the medications I’ve prescribed for you. Raghu! Breakfast is ready. Come soon. I’ll see you sometime next week, Doc. Yes, Felix. Yeah, have a nice day. Alright, guys. I have some news for you. Next week, I’m going to India. Don’t forget to pray to our family deity, Hulikere Amma. Mom, it’s a professional visit. My fans have been expecting me to vlog about my own country. I barely have time to travel the whole country. I don’t think I’ll have time for it. What are you doing about funding? Is any organisation here supporting you financially? People here are already accusing us of coming here and stealing their jobs. They look down upon immigrants like us. Do you really think they’ll fund me? There’s also the Brexit fever going around. With everyone talking about it, god knows what will happen in the future. Don’t worry. I’ll help you. When I said I wanted to visit Spain, forget funds, you didn’t even give me permission. I hate this discrimination. Look, he runs a vlog channel and has earned fans worldwide. You also achieve something, then we’ll see. Have a great time in India. Sure. Thank you. Nisha! So, what arrangements have you made for your travel in India? I’ve consulted someone online. I don’t know much about him yet. Medini. Medini, Medini! Where are you? Medini, where’s my coffee? Anjali, I’m here! Look! Wow! This is ruby. -Amazing! It’s a very expensive stone. Hi, Grandpa. Where had you been? To the tunnel. How many times have I told you not to go there? Why did you go there? To look for these stones. You asked me to go look for them. Did I tell you? Yeah. I totally forgot. From now on, even if I tell you, don’t go near that tunnel. There are leopards there. The real danger is from the leopards in the city, not the forest, Grandpa. You always have something to say. Mythili, even if she calls you, don’t go to the tunnel. My name is not Mythili. It’s Anjali. Oh, I’m so sorry. Your name also ends with ‘li’ right, so it’s okay. How is your uncle doing? It’s been six months since he passed away. I’m sorry. Okay, I’ll leave now. Bye. -Okay. Bye. Li, Li, the pick-axe, tray? My hands are full. Bye. -Bye. Bye bye! And tell everyone in your house that I send my regards! - Okay. Grandpa, let's go. Hmm, ruby. Topaz. This is amethyst. Tiger’s eye. And this is diopside, I guess? Very good. Yes! But, I didn’t find even a small piece of diamond. There aren’t many left for you to find. You might rarely find it in riverbeds or deep under sedimentary rocks. But learn one thing. If you want to find anything really valuable, you have to dig very deep. But nowadays, no one has the patience to take the effort and dig deep. That’s why there is a big black market for duplicates. How can you tell whether it is original or duplicate? This is a duplicate diamond. Pass me the paper. If you keep this against the letters, you can still read them clearly. Right? Had it been a genuine diamond, you wouldn’t be able to read the letters. Light would be refracted. You can also tell just by looking. But you need experience for that. I am very happy today. Isn’t it showing on my face? Let me see. Why so happy? The American government has returned ₹700 million worth of stolen Indian artefacts back to us. And our company, Treasures of India, is the reason behind it. Wow! Congrats, Grandpa. That’s why your name is Bhagiratha, King of Kosala! King Bhagiratha brought river Ganga to earth. And our Bhagiratha is bringing back all the stolen Indian artefacts. So proud of you, Grandpa! So proud of you! But now I’m sad. Isn’t it showing on my face? Is it so? Yes yes, you look sad. But why? Because, the one who smuggled these ancient artefacts was an Indian. A ready Indian! What are we doing here? This wasn’t part of the plan. You always have a surprise for us. What is it today? I have changed the plan. Air route is risky. We have to go through sea route. I've made arrangements. My men will collect it at final destination. Good morning. Hmm. Is this the residence of Mr. Bhageeraath? It’s not Bhageeraath. It’s Bhagiratha. And yes, this is the house. Oh. Nice house. So tiring. It’s a long drive. Would you mind if I ask you for a cup of coffee? Get up. Get to work. You want coffee right away? What? The whole house is loosely wired, just like you. Power trips happen often. Look, I’m Kanishka and I’m from- I don’t care whether you are Kanishka or Ashoka. First you have to work. Now, come fix the bulb in the bathroom. What? Wait. What is this? Who do you think I am? - Just come. Have I come to the wrong place? Not at all. You have come to the right place, but at the wrong time. You are Kanishka right? Yes. I’m Bhagiratha. This is Medini, my granddaughter. Please sit down. -Hi. Didn’t you mention that the electrician will be coming? That’s next week. He was supposed to come next month, but he has come early. No, no. I’ve come at the right time. Check the emails if you want. You are losing your memory, Grandpa. I insulted him unknowingly. I’m sorry. I’m also sorry. I thought this is the month of June. But this is July right? Venkta! Yes, sir. Take his luggage from the car and keep it in the guest room upstairs. Okay. You can go upstairs and freshen yourself. We will meet later and talk in detail. -Sure. Could I get a cup of coffee at least now? You haven’t offered him coffee yet? You were the one who told me not to give even water. Did I tell you to not give water? -What? Um, that was for the electrician. Not for him. Shambo Shankara. Greetings to Harishchandra Adugimani. How is your service to the nation going on? I’m not devoted to the nation. I’m devoted to money. Bhatkal is safer than Bombay. From there, the shipment should reach Abu Dhabi. The shipment from Shanghai should reach Muscat. Shambo, don’t call it 'shipment'. Call it 'baby'. Haven’t I sent all the babies to the right place at the right time? Be patient. I have zero tolerance for any errors. Understand? Be careful. Good morning, Grandpa! Good morning. Did you have coffee? Yeah, I did. Good morning. Good morning. Nice lab. With lot of alien equipment. Is that your website? Sure. Oh, Prajavani. You know what? Even in England, my father subscribes to this paper. Oh! Are you comfortable with the amenities here? -Hmm. First class! Some mosquitoes and lizards by the windows. There’s no electricity at night. There’s occasional smoke. And, there’s a weird smell. A little dust. That’s it. Otherwise, it’s great. Fantastic. Yes, that’s the spirit. You must learn to enjoy the scent of the earth and the dust. You must learn to love the creatures such as mosquitoes, insects, lizards, and snakes. Only then, you’ll like India. Medini, tell Guide Gafoor to come. He’s gone to UP, remember? With the French team. Oh, then call Chengappa. He hasn't come back from his honeymoon yet. Okay, leave it. I’ll call Hanumanthu- -Excuse me. I don’t have much time. Please don’t waste my time. So what do we do now? You take him to the tunnel. Didn't you say there’re leopards there? Let him see the leopards. If the leopard sees him, it’ll run away. What did you say? Nothing. I think the grandfather-granddaughter duo is like silver and gold. No silver. Only gold. I am the gold. And she is my diamond. It’s because of the British rule that India has progressed as much today. Have you come all the way from England to claim this? You won’t receive warm hospitality anymore, get lost. That’s not a right attitude. Come on, let’s debate. Come on. The British eradicated bonded slavery. Yet they enslaved the whole nation. They introduced the railways. Only so that they could transport cotton, steel and gold from India. If they hadn’t introduced electricity, you would still be grinding millets. Churning millets strengthens your muscles. These machines have ruined our country. The British integrated small kingdoms with geographical surveys and brought the idea of one nation. They never wanted to unite Indians. Divide and rule was their policy. The culture of cricket, fashion, and architecture were all introduced by British. Even science was introduced by them. The science and technology that India had was enough to distribute to the whole world. We are proud of our holy book, Bhagavad Gita, right? Bhagavad Gita is being read across the globe because of Charles Wilkins, who translated it to English. That’s the greatness of the Bhagavad Gita. Not his translation. Even Indian Civil Services was their contribution. Poor people are suffering from useless laws and files piled on the tables of bureaucrats. You aren't understanding me, you aren't even trying. You’re stupid. Hey, you are stupid. You! You- you- you are stupid. Let's meet my professor. He’ll decide this. I heard your arguments. I also heard your arguments. What do you think is right? It’s difficult to say what's right or wrong about 200 years of history. You missed one point. One of the benefits of British rule in India was that the society was divided into upper and lower castes and the lower caste was denied education. The British made way for people of all castes and genders to study together. So, you’re on his side? Not at all. Every argument is partially true. We try and win the argument with lies and exaggeration. You also missed a point. What is it? The introduction of English threatened Kannada and many other local languages. So the truth is on my side. Definitely not. The truth is neither on the left nor on the right. It’s always somewhere in the middle. We just have to find it. The British rule in India caused both good and bad. How do we find out what is right? A solution? Why don't you both get married? Ah? What? -What? Nonsense. -Hey, what mad man did you bring me to? Marry him? Me? No, thank you. The end of all fighting is love. The end of love is marriage. The end of marriage is more fighting. I am very angry. Can't you tell from my face? Yeah, I can tell. I have to go to Germany. Germany? Yes. But why? I have to go to Germany and slap him and take the next flight back. Who? Who else? That Hanumanthu. Despite being named after the unmarried god, Hanuman, he eloped with the German tourist Julie while showing her Jhansi. Not only that, he used her money to go to Germany, married her and is now settled there! Useless! Are you crazy? What about me? My time is running out! Don’t worry. Medini will accompany you. What? No. Never. I cannot spend a single bloody day with this All India Radio. Forget a day? I will not spend even a moment with this BBC. I’m not going anywhere with this argumentative woman. Kanishk! Argument is very important. Society needs arguments. India is full of arguments. In these arguments, the country finds its solace, peace and development. The programmes on TV news channels during the night are the proof of it. How about you both continue your arguments in the journey? Grandpa, you go with him if you want to. Please leave me alone. Fine then, I’ll- -Hey hey, that’s okay. I’ll somehow manage with her. You don’t need to come. I don’t know if he’s good or not, but he seems like he is. But keep your eyes open. There are volunteers everywhere. I’ve arranged everything. I’ve planned the routes for you. It’s not like you are going for the first time. Have the flights been booked? Flights? If you want to see the real India, you have to travel by bus, rail, boat and animal carts. You will get to see our country’s colours, languages, flavours, diversity and essence if you travel by road! How can you call yourself a vlogger if you don’t explore these. Both of you pack and get ready. Grandpa! Hello! I am Mahesh. Bhatkal Coastal Security Police. This is very important, confidential information. The blue diamond will reach Bhatkal at 1pm on a small boat. Blue diamond? Small boat? Okay, okay! I am understanding. Mr. Mahesh, I asked you to hold my phone for a moment but you're chatting here. On top of that, you're speaking in English. Give it. If he didn’t know Kannada, what can I do? Whose call was it? I don’t know, sir. What were they saying? Uh, they said something about a blue diamond and a small boat. It’s a call from England. How unfortunate that this call came when the phone was with you. Damn, it’s not connecting. When will the boat arrive? That’s the part I didn’t get. And I’m supposed to catch these smuggling gangs with people like you. I think Gosumbe is behind this. Shambo Shankara. Once I inform boss about this, my work is done. Pick up the phone. Put it on speaker. Shambo Shankara. Hello, boss! Boss, good morning, boss. It’s bad morning here. Was the baby’s delivery normal or caesarean? Boss, everything went smooth. No problem, boss. Normal delivery, boss. Oh, the baby is so cute, boss. Blue eyes, boss! Lucky, boss. Lucky! If you are okay, I’ll bring the baby to you for your blessings. Blessings need an auspicious day. And we need Shambo Shankara's blessings. Where is that Shambo Shankara? When will he come? Hey, he’s God. Why will he come? We have to go to him. Oh no, I didn’t know, boss. Hey! -Yes. Be careful with the baby. Make sure you watch it all the time. Okay, boss. Take good care of the baby. Don’t worry, boss. Not even a single hair should be affected. Nothing will happen, boss. Let this inauspicious time pass. I’ll call you myself. You can bring the baby then. -Okay, boss. No problem, no tension, boss. Until then, I’ll take very good care of it. Shambo Shankara. Who was that? He spoke about a baby, what was that? Sir, I help take care of orphaned children. When a baby is born, they come and get my blessings. You please continue. Hey! Hey! Hey! -Hey! Stop! Stop! Why are you trying to escape? I’m coming from the boat, sir. Is it so? You are coming from the boat? No, sir, I don’t know anything. -Oh, really? Where is the smuggler? Where is the smuggler? -I really don’t know, sir. You don’t know anything? Where is the smuggler? -He went that way, sir. Which way? He said he would head towards Bengaluru, sir. Hello, control room. Gosumbe has escaped. Place roadblocks. Why did you stop the car? Boss- -What happened? It’s a checkpost. Everyone get down. Sir, my wife is in labour. She’s in pain. We have to go to the hospital immediately. Please, sir. Damn. What terrible situation did you bring us to? Where are we going, that you’re so tensed? Ah! To your wife’s home! Hey, wasn’t there any other road? Is this the only one? Boss, shall I run them over? Ah! You’ll run them over? Shut up and sit quietly. We’ve seen many tricks like this. Get down. We’ve been instructed to check every vehicle. Get down. Excuse me. May I know what’s happening here? You think we’ll let you go if you speak English? We have to check every vehicle. Get down, lady. Look at this atrocity. My wife is suffering from labour pain, and they are forcing her to get down. The rules are the same for everyone. Rules are made to help the public, not to inconvenience them. Well, does that mean we shouldn’t do our duty? Did we ask her to get pregnant? Ridiculous. Listen, let this car go. You can check our cars thoroughly, okay? What will you do if the smuggled item goes with this car? I’ll record a video and post it on social media and television. Do whatever you want. Nobody cares about the media. We follow our instructions. Where is your officer? Where is your officer? Don’t you have any sense of humanity? Would you have done the same if your sister was in this situation? -What is going on? We’re checking every vehicle, sir. Okay, carry on. -Sir. Okay, sir. What’s the commotion all about? The lady suffering from labour pain is being delayed for no reason. Will you let this car go or not? Using a fake pregnancy to smuggle things is an old trick. Haven't we seen numerous such cases in our service, sir. Hey, not every case is the same. If anything happens to this woman, I will not spare you. You’re Bhagiratha’s granddaughter, right? Yes, sir. -How come you’re here? This great fellow is from England. I’m taking him on a tour of India, but by then- We’re dealing with all this in your own hometown. Wonder what it’ll be like in Mumbai, Amritsar and other places. Great experience! Listen, her grandfather is a respectable man. Let these two cars go. Okay, sir. You can leave. -Thank you, sir. Move, move. Get down. Come. Hello police officers! Let's go. -How can you let those cars go and stop me? Does it seem like we are smugglers? Hey, hey, remove the barricades. Ah! Some people, you feel like letting go. Others, you want to have a go at. Hello, don’t be sarcastic about my height and colour. I may look like a comedian, but in real life, I’m a hero! Hero! Hey, let us go. Ah! I’ve think I've seen you somewhere. Which station do you belong to? Hey! You think you've seen me somewhere? Hey, Gosumbe! Oh, he thinks I’m Gosumbe. No, Gosumbe is my elder brother. Oh! So you are? I’m Mosumbe. Oh. So, is he a date? No, he’s a raisin. Do you need to know all that? Just let us go. Hey! -Ah! Tell me where you've hid the diamond. Hey, go check the car! Wait for it. Who do you think I am? -Which official are you? In five minutes, we’ll know who you really are. -Hey, don’t lay hand on me. You won’t know what will happen to you, what town you’ll get transferred to. I’ll show you who I am. Give me 10 minutes. Hey, take the phone out. So many ministers- -What happened? Sir, I didn’t find anything in the car. Leave me. You’re insulting an official by stopping us like this. The police are not accountable these days. Nonsense. -Sir, sir, sir. Don’t just send him away. -Why? Ah. -Sir, I think we should peel this mosambi fruit and check. Aha! -You’re right. Strip search him. Shhh. Side please. You want me to take off my clothes, right? You haven’t seen me without clothes, have you? Shall I remove my shirt? Shall I remove my pant? -Hey! What shall I remove? -Don’t put your hand there! Look all you want. -I can’t bear it. You go now. Where will you go? I’ll catch you one day. I’ll keep an eye on you. I’ll show you the influence I have! I'll show you. You’ll be transferred within the next couple of days! Hey, stop. Stop, stop. Hey, stop, stop. Stop. Damn, I missed them. I want to see places where there's significant British contribution. Take me there. You keep saying that Britain has contributed a lot to India. This is one of them. Vidhurashwatha. Jallianwala Bagh of Karnataka. It was April 25, 1938. The police fired indiscriminately at a group of villagers who had congregated to organise a peaceful protest. There were dead bodies everywhere. Along with a farmer named Gowramma, 32 innocent people were killed. That day, Vidhurashwatha was soaked in blood. I feel nauseous. People are running helter-skelter. Someone is shrieking. I can hear someone crying for help. I can see blood stains everywhere. The smell of death is still strong here. I wonder how terrifying that night must have been. Excuse me. Do you guys even know how sacred this place is? What? Do you all know about this place? And its significance? One should come here and sit quietly and perhaps shed a tear. But instead, you’re playing music and playing cards. Damn. But that’s our choice. An innocent female farmer named Gowramma gave her life here. And this was 80 years back. Do you know why? And for whom? How do we know? For all of you. For the freedom of this land. You come to a place like this and- Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Sorry, sir. We won’t repeat it again. Not just here, whenever you go to sacred places like this, don’t do such things. Leave. ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ ♪ Mother India ♪ ♪ Victory to you, ♪ ♪ the minds of people. ♪ ♪ Victory to you, ♪ ♪ our Constitution. ♪ ♪ Have you seen India? ♪ ♪ and Mandya in India? ♪ ♪ The most beautiful in the world ♪ ♪ Unity in diversity ♪ ♪ Hundreds of languages ♪ ♪ but a common desire ♪ ♪ Hundreds of colours ♪ ♪ but we are one, brother ♪ ♪ It's not 'my country', 'your country', or 'their country'. ♪ ♪ It’s our country ♪ ♪ It’s our country ♪ ♪ It’s our country ♪ ♪ Victory to you, ♪ ♪ the minds of people. ♪ ♪ Victory to you, ♪ ♪ our Constitution. ♪ ♪ Do you know the history of the brave queen of Kittur? ♪ ♪ Why did you forget Raayanna, who ascended the gallows? ♪ ♪ Brave Queen Jhansi Lakshmibai defeated the wicked and sacrificed her life in the bloodbath ♪ ♪ How much violence and looting have you survived, Mother India? ♪ ♪ How did you bear the pain of such deep wounds? ♪ ♪ How did you bear the pain? ♪ In the textbooks we study in the UK, all this information is missing.

Didn't the current Canadian government recently apologise for that? Why shouldn’t the British do the same? Fine. Come. Let's go. Shambo Shankara. Was the delivery normal or caesarean? I heard it was normal and that the baby is healthy. Heard? Haven't you seen the baby yet? How can you be so irresponsible? Shambo, Bhatkal is 475km from Bengaluru. A joker named Gosumbe is singing lullabies and bringing the baby here. Have you lost your mind? How can you entrust a joker with a baby worth millions of rupees? Shambo, he’s not just a joker. He’s a good doctor too. He’s helped deliver many such babies. I'll not be able to sleep until I hear that the baby is safe with you. Do you know the tagline of our company or not? I know, Shambo. Zero tolerance for errors. Shambo Shankara. Stop! Where? What? Where to? Yeah, what? -Hey! Where did you come from? I’m from the UK. UK! From Uttarakhand? No, it’s United Kingdom. Ah, United Kingdom. Gone case. Give me the bag. I’ve been instructed to check it, give me the bag. For what? I’m a tourist. I don't care whether you’re a tourist or a terrorist. I have instructions to check the bag.

It’s me, your boss speaking. Is my blue baby safe? Boss, boss, boss, boss. The baby is safe. Since it’s a baby, it’s just playing around. I looked away for a moment, and it is missing. But I won’t let it go. I’ll find it, boss. It's missing? Hey Gosumbe. I’ll ensure your thithi (funeral). Do you know what thithi means? Thithi! I know, boss. What a film, boss! The way it talks about social concerns, the dialogues of ‘Gaddappa’ and ‘Century Gowda’. Wow! Super film, boss! Hey, you idiot Gosumbe. -Why, boss?

Anything special? Oh, she ran away. At least you tell me, Anjali. She has asked me to blush and run away just like she did. Ask her if you want. What is this? What’s happening here? Actually, I was thinking of taking a precious diamond of yours to England. Medini and I, we are in love. I’m thinking of taking her to England. I’ll take very good care of her. But I need your permission. You may take good care of her but Medini is not just a lifeless diamond to me. She is my whole life. I can’t imagine how I’ll live without her. You make me cry, Grandpa. Can’t you tell from my face? Of course I can, my sweet child. I feel like crying too. I won’t go anywhere, Grandpa. I’ll stay here with you forever. Life doesn’t work that way. You can’t stay with someone forever. When the time comes, people have to go their own ways. Let her come with me and meet my parents. If everything works out, we’ll take it forward. It’s true that we love each other, but we won’t proceed without our elders’ blessings. Good. You are a modern man with traditional values. What about her visa? Ticket? It’s all done. Everything is online these days. Yes. We’re not far from having online marriages. When her parents passed away in an accident, she was 10 years old, I’ve raised her with a lot of love. She’s a little short tempered and impulsive. You may also have some shortcomings, but your love should be strong enough to overcome such flaws. Take your time. Understand each other well. It gets cold there. Don’t forget to take the sweaters your grandmother knit for you. Take good care of her. God bless you both. Hi, Kanu! How are you? I’m good, mom. Mom, I have good news. I’m bringing a rare diamond for you from India. Don’t fool me. Haven’t the British taken away all the precious diamonds from India already? Mom, this is a live diamond. Look. Namasthe! I’m Medini. Medini! Medini means ‘earth’. You are indeed a diamond. Thank you. Even my grandfather says the same. Mom, you know how you always wanted me to marry a girl from India? Well, this is her. What do you think? You mean marriage? Oh my god, wait. I’ll call your father. Raghu, come here. He’s made our job easy. Your son has found a girl. A Kannada girl. Oh, is this why you went to India? This is a matter of marriage, be careful. Don’t commit a mistake like me and regret it forever. Stop it. Always fooling around- -Ask him to share her details. When you get time, email her birth chart. Forget the birth chart. I’m bringing her with me. You can ask her anything you want. Okay. Bye for now! Bye. -Bye! India is such a lovely nation. I'm in love with the people here. People are so nice here, right? Kanishka! What’s going on? Hey, where are you from? Who is she? Where are you going? What is happening here? Don’t you understand Kannada? You want a Kannada girl, but not the language? I know enough Kannada to teach you lessons. But there isn’t time for that now. You must have mistook us for someone else. Leave her and the bag, and walk away Go on, leave. Leave! Hey, leave me! Leave me! You got it? -Boss! Give it! -It's the diamond, boss! Well done! It was a waste paying those idiots. I'm proud of you! Is this the bag? -Yes, boss. Diamond bag. Didn't I tell you to fetch a blue and green bag. -This is blue bag, boss. I can’t believe you got this one instead. You fool, idiot! You don’t do anything properly! Get lost! I’ll kill you! Just get out of my sight! Go! Help, help, help! Kanishka! It's easy to understand India, but not Indians. Thank you. Next. -Let's go. Good morning. Where do you come from? What is the purpose of your visit? Talk! How long would you be staying in the UK? She’s with me and she’ll be here- - Let me, let me ask her. Where do you come from? What is the purpose of your visit? How long would you be staying in the UK? Wow! You ask so many questions. Did we ask you such questions when you came to India 200 years ago? You hoisted your flag wherever you set foot and looted our country. Did we stop and ask you questions like this? You came to trade, divided our people and plundered our wealth. Where was your visa then? What language are you speaking? -Just be quiet. Pure Kannada. You asked me where I’ll be staying, right? At the Buckingham Palace. You asked me why I came, right? To calculate the worth of gold, diamonds, and other valuables you stole from us. When will you be going back to your country? How can he ask me when I’m going back when I just got here? Did we treat them like this when they came to our country? Would you please stop? English! English, please. Sorry, she doesn’t speak English. She’s talking in her native language. What is she saying? She’s saying that England is a beautiful country and, she wants to see Buckingham Palace and River Thames. I’ll make sure that she'll see the best part of England. Place your thumb here. Okay, look at the camera. Have a great time. Thank you. Namasthe. Hey, wait I’m coming. Next. Hello, hello, welcome. -Hi! Hello Dad. Hi Mom! Hi. Good to see you. -Mom! This is Medini. Happy to meet you. -Hi. Namasthe. -Namasthe. Welcome. How was the journey? It was good. I’m going to be married into this country soon. Instead of welcoming me in a traditional way, that idiot was asking me all sorts of questions. If he had understood your words, forget welcoming, he would have kicked us both into jail. You want to insult them in their own country? But what about what they did? They came in the name of trade and ruled us. As long as there are people to rule, rulers will exist. If we had unity then, why would they have ruled us? Anyway, at least we both are unified now. Whatever it is, you’re my BBC. BBC? What do you mean? British born cunning fellow!

London India. Natives here are a minority while migrants are in majority. become a headache for the natives. Aren’t you a migrant too? Citing my example? It is very difficult to save the UK from the migrants. Didn’t they go to every corner of the world and enslave them? Let them realise the pain. To save London from migrants, they have to find themselves a 'British Gandhi' soon. No way. It’s impossible to find another Gandhi. Gandhi can only be born in India. My dear All India Radio, the British were the ones who gave democracy to the world. And, women were first allowed to vote here, that too hundreds of years ago. Hello, forget hundreds, do you know what Adi Kavi Pampa said thousands of years ago? 'Mankind is one.' Have you heard of Akkamahadevi? She spoke of women’s liberation in the 12th century. And speaking of democracy, the first person to introduce democracy to the world was Basavanna. And that is why his statue is erected on the bank of river Thames. That’s what you’re good at. Taking all the good things in the world and claiming it as your own. Come, let’s pay our respects to Basavanna. So, how does life here compare to there? Ours is a big country, but we lead a modest life. This is a small country, but people live large. Very good observation. You think just like I do. We would like to introduce you to our community. Is that okay with you? I’d have to seek my grandfather’s consent. His consent is very important to me. That’s absolutely fine. Did you hear that? Nisha, I’m talking to you. She said she needs her grandfather’s consent to decide. And then there's you. But I don’t have my grandfather. Nisha. Raghu, guest list is ready. This isn’t a guest list. It’s a voter’s list. These are the people who voted for me. They’re members of our Kannada Sangha. I think it’s enough to invite about ten families. But not Mahalakshmi. Actually, invite her first. Let her see our daughter-in-law and feel jealous. It’s a good opportunity to shut her up. And what about Venkatraju, Arun- Cut them off first. They’ll just go to the kitchen and finish all the biryani. Nasty fellows. In this list, I’ll call some people. You call the Kannada Sangha members. And an SMS is enough for the rest. I called to invite you to join us for a celebration. This Sunday, we are planning to share our joy. That’s wonderful. Trouble is, Doc I’m on my way to the US on the weekend to have vacation with the family. Oh! I will make it up to you. How about popping over to mine tomorrow evening for a few drinks with the family? I’m game. I should be done by 7pm. Yeah, that’d be brilliant. Alright. -See you then. I got the news! Don't worry. We’ll be there. Why should I not worry? You must come. As you know, I don’t invite everyone. Only the most important people. Thank you. Don’t take this the wrong way, I’m only telling you because we’re close, teach Nisha some decency. Why, what happened? She’s taken indecent photos with white boys and posted it on Instagram and Facebook. Can’t look at them. And you’re always talking about Indian culture. I’ll speak to her about this. You please don’t talk to anyone else about this. So Sunday, you must come. Yes, we’ll be there. Please. Look at the long queue to view India’s Kohinoor diamond. It’s only because the Kohinoor is here that it is safe and so many people are able to see it. Tell me one thing honestly. Which museum in India is maintained this well? Of course, it is to be appreciated. They have indeed safe-guarded a stolen diamond well. Who knows the truth? Many things could be falsely documented in history. You and I can’t fix that now. Why not? If I get a chance, I’ll steal the diamond and take it back to India. If you really love me, propose to me with the original Kohinoor diamond. Propose you with the original Kohinoor diamond? Seriously? I’d rather propose to Nicole Kidman with it. Why would I give it to you? Go. Fine, give it to her. Hey. No, thank you. Oh! Orange juice? I don’t mind. Medini, he collects rare diamonds, jewellery and Indian antiques. Felix, you know, she is also a great connoisseur of Indian antiques. Oh, really? You’ll be very surprised with what you'll see in my gallery. Rupert, Yes, sir. show these lovely people my collection while I speak to Raghu. Very well, sir. Would you like to follow me? And these are the zeolites. They represent wealthy materials, that form and colour you get in this range of minerals. Over here we have the representations of over 400 different mineral types. Only about 10% of those are available around the world though. And here we have some examples of fluorite and topaz. Great Blue Diamond? Found in a sacred Indian temple in the 17th century, it is believed to represent- -one of its kind. Hey, One of its kind? -what happened? Calm down, you’re not supposed to be loud here. -Okay. Okay. The Great Blue Diamond. You can get this in our village fair. It’s a blatant lie. -What? Didn’t I show you some diamonds on the streets of Surat? Just like those, this is a duplicate. Actually. Excuse me, did you say duplicate? This is not a fake. This diamond is worth £15 million. £15 million for this? Give me ₹3,000. I’ll get you an exact replica done from Nasir. It seems to be a fake. -Will you shut up? You create a scene wherever you go. You always have to say something. What is she saying? -What? Hey, nothing, she’s just kidding. In fact, she’s appreciating the collection here. Hey, when did I appreciate the collection? Hello! -Thank you. Thank you very much. Let’s go. Did she just say it was a fake? Or was she just kidding? I’m sorry, I have to say this to you. I say this to you as your doctor, not your friend. You’re drinking too much. You’re drinking during the daytime, it’s not good for you. I understand your concerns. Yeah, you have to do something about it, Felix. I will, I will. I will. Hey, did you like my surprise? I didn’t find anything great there. Oh, it was actually, like, brillaint. You’ve got an excellent collection. Medini, you should not speak so bluntly in front of them. Aren't we their guests? Could I have a word, please sir? Not now, later, later. Sir, it really is quite important. Look, I’ve got important guests here with me. Don’t you know, this is my family doctor. Look, go away. Don’t just be bothering us now. Very well, sir. So, anyway, you were saying? About your collection. Your house is lovely. So rich and beautiful. Hey, I’m talking to you for so long, why are you so silent? I’m waiting for your appreciation list to finish. That will never end. Your brother is a real hero. He cares about me so much. Once in India, when someone tried to trouble me, he 'thadakda'. 'Thadakda' means? It means he beat them up. He picked a fight for me. Like real 'dishoom dishoom'. Very good. He didn’t do anything for his sister ever. But he fought for his lover. Do you know, he’s so romantic. Even the way he proposed to me was so romantic. Yes, that he does well. He has a lot of experience doing it. What? Yes, dating, proposing, and romancing that’s his profession. Naturally, he does it well. What do you mean? Look at these pics. These are all his ex-girlfriends. Jenny, Alexandra, Charlotte, and Chloe, they were living together. Your serial number is 7 or 8. Do your parents know about this? Yes, they know it all. Then why did they make me a victim? Why didn’t they tell me anything? Very simple. You date white girls. But when it comes to marriage, traditional Indian girls. They needed you to exhibit in front of their community here. That’s it. My wife Rekha’s Bharathanatyam program is coming up. You all must come? -Good one. You all must come? -Good one. Please, have a drink. -Okay. Sure. -Welcome. Hi. Hello. Hi. -Hi. Hello. I came just now. -Hi. Amarindar, -Hi. Hello. Hi. I need to have a word with you later. -Cheers to you. No problem. I’ll be around. -Hi. Congratulations Raghu! -How come all of you came before me? Hey, thank you. But, you should congratulate Kanishka, not me. -Hi. Nice to see you all. Hi. Hello. He insisted that he’d marry an Indian girl. -Please. Thank you. No thanks. He went to India- -and he interviewed 20 girls before selecting her. Is it? Hi. This justifies your position as the President of our Kannada Sangha. Thank you. Finally, you managed to get a Kannada girl as daughter-in-law. You’re really lucky, to have such a good son. That too in this day and age in England. Forget England. It’s difficult to find an ideal girl for marriage even in India. It’s hard to adjust to life here after growing up in India. Yet you’ve found her. Yeah. Talking about the entire North Indian community, -Thank you. not just Punjabi, -Thanks UP, and -Congratulations. Thank you. Bihar, even the Gujarati community, if you all could support us- -Of course. That can be done. Sure. So, I depend on you for support. Absolutely, doctor. -Hi. Cheers! - Congrats. Thank you. Medini was born into a patriotic family. -Cheers! Her grandfather is a gemologist. There are too many elders here. Should we go somewhere else? No, I want to show them that I’m in no way inferior. Let’s stay here. So tell us, how did you woo the girl? We used to always fight. I guess the fighting led to love. Hey, tell me seriously. Who proposed whom? That’s a mystery. Even we don’t know. I’m not sure. Maybe, it must have been her. He won’t tell us. Guess he’s shy. Instead of him, why don’t we just ask the girl? What are her educational qualifications? What is she planning to do in the future? Will she be based here or in India? Look at him. He’s all shy. How long will you keep her a suspense? Introduce her to us. She’ll be here any moment, she’s getting dressed. She’s just a little shy. Don’t worry. London’s cold weather will drive away all the shyness. Janu, -Yes, go and get her. It’s getting late. -Okay. Medini. Medini. Medini. Medini. I keep telling you to not eat starchy food. No, but you always manage to stay fit. You try dieting. -Me and dieting? Who told you? No way. -Eat everything. I eat everything. -I eat everything too. What? Look, Kanu, what is all this? Why did this happen? I don’t know. I’m clueless. How could she go to India without telling anyone? I’m sorry. There’s been some communication gap. Didn’t I tell you? People who grew up in India can’t adjust to this lifestyle. I feel bad. This shouldn’t have happened to you. That too being the community leader? Did she really go to India, or somewhere else? I think it’s better to inform the police. What are you doing here? I’m fine, Mom. Just looking at the rainbow. She too appeared and disappeared just like a rainbow. Don’t get too sentimental. You’ve travelled the world. I’m sure she had a strong reason to leave without informing us. I believe the reason is only known to you both. I really don’t know the reason, Dad. Could I have done something wrong? I don’t think so. Look, rainbows don’t disappear forever. Listen to me. Go to India. Find her. Talk to her. Okay? Yes. Just go. Come on. Come. Come on.- - Get up. Rupert, have you got a minute? Yes, sir. Look, you’re not still sulking, are you? No, sir. Look I’m sorry about the other day. I had a few too many to drink. What was it you wanted to talk to me about? That’s not so important now, sir. Look, it had to be important for you to mention it. I’ll be the judge whether it is or not? Well, do you remember when the doctor visited the other day? There was that girl with him. Yes. When I gave them a tour of the gem gallery, I was listening to their conversation. I’m sure I overheard her say that the Great Blue Diamond is a fake. What? You think we ought to get it checked out, sir? Just to be sure? Ugh. Call the Belgian. René? Yes, if you think that’s a good idea? We need it checked out thoroughly. I paid a damn fortune for that thing. Right you are, sir. I’m on it. Hello, René? Felix, I’ve conducted a few tests using a gemological stereomicroscope and the refractometer. There are visible gas bubbles. Moreover, none of the 4C characteristics are present. This diamond appears to be synthetic, probably moissanite. But you had verified it before the auction. Yes, I did. It was original. Weighing 110 carats. It had excellent, brilliant VVS1 clarity. I’m sorry, something must have happened afterwards. Oh no It’s a fake. Thank you. Rupert, You’re right. That diamond is a fake. That girl, she’s up to mischief. Call the police, we need to find her. Right away, sir. Felix? Thank god you picked up the phone. You’re sounding anxious, Felix. What’s the matter? Everything okay? Is Medini there? Medini? She’s not here, Felix. She left. Where? She left for India. What? I’m sorry. I’m in the middle of something. Can I talk to you later? Wait, no, no, Raghu, Raghu! Hello sir, you called the police? Yes, I certainly did. How can I help? We need a diamond investigation immediately. Okay. It’s been stolen and we need to get that. It’s a £15 million worth diamond. How much, sorry? £15 million! - Oh, £15 million! From this house. Mr. Dickens is absolutely livid. What are the circumstances around here? Has there been a break in or-? Well it looks like it’s been substituted for another duplicate. That sort of value, I’m afraid I’m going to have to get CID involved. So I’m sure they’ll give you a ring later today. Yes, please do. Same number you contacted us on today? Yes. Yeah, okay. Thanks for the information. Thank you. Safe journey home. - Alright, bye. Well, we checked the gallery where they held the auction and they’ve got the proof to show that the diamond was original when they handed it over to you. So something might have happened post that. We’ll contact the Indian embassy and check her antecedents. We’ll do a thorough investigation into this. We’ll need the last two weeks of your CCTV footage of your private gallery. Yes, of course. Raghu, your jacket. Dad? You’re up early. Nisha, what happened? Sorry, Mom. I’ve hurt you both a lot. Sorry, Dad. Perhaps, this is the first time the word ‘sorry’ is coming out of your mouth, right? I need to tell you something. I’m the one who messed with Medini. I’m the reason she left to India. What? Why did you do that? I was jealous of him. You always gave him more preference and I felt neglected. Nisha! Your brother would worry about you so much. The times you came home late, he would go looking for you. Did you never understand his love? I’m understanding it now. The house feels empty without both of them. You both are so depressed. What do we do now? Sit down. You have to call both of them and explain this. You made this mistake. You have to fix it. Yes, Dad. I’ve learnt from my mistakes. And I don’t love my mistakes anymore. Hello? Medini? Nisha? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sorry, Nisha. I’m not interested in speaking to anyone. Please. Please don’t hang up. I’m ashamed of my words and behaviour. My brother is a really good guy. He has fans but he doesn’t have any girlfriends. He didn’t have a live-in relationship with anyone. I just got possessive because I thought you were stealing my brother from me. I thought I lost my importance because of you. Nisha- I’m understanding your value now. Please don’t leave my brother. Please, please Medini, please. Nisha, Did you think I left your brother because of an immature girl’s words? I have other reasons for that. Your brother’s love is pure. You should apologise to him first. Take care. I valued your words and left their home without informing them. They would have been so humiliated. Moreover, they took very good care of me. They had invited all their friends to introduce me to them. How right is it to hurt people who trust us for some unforeseen reasons? What should we do if we’re betrayed by someone we trust? Only time will answer such questions. And I’m waiting for that time. Don’t ask me anything until then. Until that time comes, won’t I be suffering from the guilt of hurting the one who loves me? Oh! Don’t I love you? Always remember one thing, Medini. There’s always a strong reason behind everything your grandfather does. Until then, be patient. Ugh, can’t believe I lost it. Hey, start the car, start the car! Come on, let’s go! He’s going there! Isn’t the summer very hot this time? This is a coastal town. It’s always hot. I guess you are new to this place. Excuse me, I’ve served along this coast for the past 10 years. I’ve done innumerable routes from Karwar to Kasargod along the coast. Constable Kariappa! Search thoroughly. How far is Bhatkal from here? You should know, right? You said you’ve done innumerable routes- I know, I know. I just asked. Smuggling has been on the rise in Bhatkal. Smugglers feel Bhatkal is safer than Mumbai. Why are you talking about smugglers here? I am a patriot. Don’t beat around the bush. Oh wow. You may be a patriot, but your granddaughter has got herself into trouble. Interpol, External Ministry, CBI everyone is involved. Is this you? Yes. Let me just get to the point. You paid a visit to a private museum in London. Am I right? Yes, of course. And you claimed a valuable diamond is a fake? Am I right? It was fake. Hmm. Then you must know where the original is. If you claimed that the diamond was fake, you should know where the original is, right? What? How should I know? How can you tell a diamond is a fake just by looking at it? Sir, let- -Excuse me, Mr. John. I am a professional gemologist. This is my lab. I have trained many students. She is one of them. For instance, this is a fake diamond. How can you tell is when you see these gas bubbles. Whether it is she, my students, or I, we can tell with the naked eye that it’s a fake diamond. Instead of interrogating the person who took her to the museum, why are you questioning her? It is she who claimed that the diamond was a fake. Not him. Felix here lodged a complaint against you and only you. And the very next day, you left the UK. Now that sounds very suspicious, don’t you think? Nothing suspicious, Mr. John. It’s I who asked her to come immediately. For personal reasons. Sir, I found this bag under the bed. Should we check this? Mr. Kariyappa, you’re good for nothing. Does anyone hide a valuable diamond in a tattered bag like this? Leave. Stupid. Is this bag yours? It’s Kanishka’s bag. He left it behind because it’s torn. Sir, is it wrong to call a fake a fake? Listen, I didn’t even touch the diamond. I just looked at it. Sir- -Mr. John, she has a valid point. Hmm. Well, she does appear to be innocent. But we are left with a few unanswered questions. One question is, where is the original diamond? Sir, I- -Diamond? Inspector, the British looted invaluable diamonds from India including the Kohinoor. And now, people who have defaulted ₹90 billion, ₹220 billion from our banks, have found refuge in their country. Now, when they’ve come in search of a small diamond, why would you bring him to our doorstep? But- -Sorry, what did he say? Nothing, he offered us lunch, but I declined it. Sir, shall I take that bag? My child can use it for school. Don’t act cheap wherever you go. Just leave. Thank you for your cooperation. I may be back again. You’re welcome. Because of him, the police came to our house. I’m afraid who’ll come next. I’m coming. Oh, why? To thrash someone. To beat them to a pulp. Very good, very good. Who are you beating up? Who else? You! Why hasn’t the baby reached where it is supposed to? Shambo, things went out of hand when the police got on our backs. I know who the diamond is with and where it is. Please give us some more time, Shambo. Looks like you are trying to dupe me. I take all the risk here to steal it and you lose it and dare give me excuses. The Abu Dhabi sheikh is after me for delaying it. I suggest you come here. It’s my responsibility to hand over the baby to you personally. I give you my word. But, please don’t repeat our tagline. Medini! Leave him. Have I not told you to stay away from wicked people? Come inside. Grandpa, Kanishka is a good man. I sent you to England with him believing that. But he’s a fraudster. He poses like he’s innocent but he’s a member of a mafia gang. That’s the reason I asked you to come back immediately. As if her embarrassing my family in England wasn’t enough, you’re insulting me too? Is speaking impulsively your family trait? Do you even have the morality to speak about our family? Your family went abroad in search of a living. And our family brings back India’s artefacts that are smuggled by people like you. Do you even know what patriotism means? Is patriotism limited only to your family? Look, NRIs are just as patriotic as local citizens. By the way, you’ve been labelling me a smuggler ever since I arrived. What have I even smuggled? Oh, do you need proof? Is this your backpack? Yes. It was torn, so I left it here. You didn’t leave it here. You hid it under the bed. Do you know the history of the blue diamond in this bag? This is not just any diamond. It was once the third eye of Lord Shiva’s idol. Tell me the truth. Where did you get this? Where did you plan to ship it? That bag is mine. But I’m not aware of what’s in it and who put it there. I put it there. I’m the one who put it there. Give me the bag. Boss, this is the same bag. The same eyes. The same colour. Where are you hiding? Baby, my baby. Come to me, your father is here. We don’t need this bag anymore, keep it. Oh my! Ever since you were born, you have travelled Bombay, Delhi, Amritsar and London. Look how adorable the baby looks, boss. What a creation! Give it to me. Hey! Leave. Shambo, don’t touch the baby. Tell me how much you want for taking care of the baby. Just because you took care of the baby doesn’t mean you can claim it’s yours, right? Who are you guys? Why have you come here? Don’t confuse everyone with your words. There is no confusion. Don’t you pretend. You’re all the same. Diamond smugglers. Anti-nationals. Excuse me, who are you calling anti-nationals? Partner, who is this old man? He’s speaking so rudely. At the checkpost, to safeguard the diamond from the police, I put the diamond in your bag. And I took it back the same way. How is that wrong? Not like we killed someone. How can you term us anti-nationals for that? Partner, if you want your cut, ask our boss. He’ll give it. But, we don't tolerate all this nonsense. Partner, the house looks perfect. The police won’t have any suspicion. It’s a good place to safeguard our goods. Convince the old man, we can strike a monthly deal. We can use this house permanently. Don’t you dare! -Perfect, boss. It’s riskier to safeguard the goods than to transport it. I too believe this house is perfect to safeguard our goods. We even have a beautiful nurse to take care of our baby. You idiot. -Hey! I’ll make sure you’ll be put behind bars. Take your hand off. Chill. When it’s dark, we ourselves are in the bar. Why will you put us behind the bar? Boss, leave it. We can meet these 'Bangada', 'Maththi', and 'Gold Fish' later. Let's go. Shambo, you dare not speak of the blue diamond to anyone. We have zero tolerance for errors. Thank you for taking care of the baby. Goodbye, ma’am. It’s fine, I’ll deal with it later. Finally, you succeeded in delivering the blue diamond to where you intended. Earlier the police came, and now these people came to our home. You ruined the sanctity of this home. Medini, I have to leave now. Otherwise, I’ll never be able to get the blue diamond back. This is the only opportunity I have to prove my innocence. Listen, Kanishka. They look very dangerous. Kanishka! Medini! Leave him alone! Come back in. Grandpa, he’s innocent. Please stop him. Please. Let him go. -Grandpa.. Did you not listen to what they said? -Give him a chance- They’re all the same. Boss, we’ve gotten bored of smuggling for so many years. So, if you settle our accounts, we will settle down in life. That’s why I’m taking you. Shouldn’t I introduce you to Harishchandra Adugimani? Introduce us? To Harishchandra? To Adugimani? Why does he wants to see us? -Us? He is particular about meeting the ones who delayed the delivery of the baby. Boss, there’s no mistake of ours in this. You know that we did it to protect the baby. You can do one thing. You charge any penalty applicable, cut GST, TDS, and whatever else, and settle the remaining amount, boss. Hey! Tell him. -Boss, my mother lost a kidney. My mother has lost both of her kidneys. Oh, then her being alive is a waste. -Ah! Who? Those who have lost both. Boss, don’t fool around. You’re a sly dog. Shambo, smuggling and sentiment don’t match. Didn’t I tell you? Sentiment won’t work with boss. And not to speak about family problems? Shambo, ask me how much you want directly. We'll settle it and you can leave. Ah! -Ah! Really, boss? -Really? Bro, let's ask ₹500,000 each. ₹500,000, ₹500,000! Not just ₹500,000, you fool. Let’s ask for ₹5 million. Give us just ₹5 million, boss. -Just ₹5 million. Enough, boss. Just ₹5 million? Take ₹10 million each. -We won't ask for more. Ah! -Ah! ₹10 million each? -₹10 million each? Shambo Shankara. -Hara Hara Mahadev. Sorry, Gosumbe. Shambo Shankara. I've brought your baby, safe and secure. Very good. I knew it. Shambo Shankara. Hello? Hello, help me, please! Hello! Hello! I’m sorry. I am not left with any means to prove that I’m not a smuggler or a member of the mafia. I tried my best. The blue diamond sank in the sea. I misunderstood you. Medini convinced me that you are innocent. Don’t worry. The diamond that sank was a duplicate. What? The original blue diamond- A king, who was a devotee of Lord Shiva, had gifted the blue diamond to the Trinetra temple of Shirali. The diamond caught the attention of a British officer. The officer threatened to violate the modesty of the priest's daughter unless the diamond was given. He forced the priest to attest that it was a gift. It was not a gift, it was theft. The priest commited suicide out of guilt. Under mysterious circumstances, the temple was burnt down. Hi friends, this is Kanishka. This is the most important vlog of my life. This proof reveals the plight of the priest on that dreadful day. I urge you people to share this vlog to as many people as possible and also sign the online petition at the link below. Let’s raise and unite ourselves to correct the wrongs of the past. Are you fighting this because you are an Indian too? I’m fighting this because I know this is right. Why do we need to worry about the past now? The Great Blue Diamond belonged to India and it should continue to belong to India. Why should we support you in your fight? It’s not my fight. It’s our fight. Finally, India won the custody of the diamond in the International Court of Justice. My sincerest apologies to all Indians, but I'm returning the diamond back to India where it truly belongs. At least now, some mistakes from history need to be corrected. Beyond cricket, India and England need to fight different kinds of matches. India vs England! We need to win these matches. And we surely will. Let the victory be ours! Jai Hind!
