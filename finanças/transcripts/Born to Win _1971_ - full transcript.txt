They say I'm a charmer. I charm my hustles. Well, that comes after dealing with women, you know. After hairdressing. I love to dress hair. I kind of think of myself as an artist. I treat people the way most people don't treat 'em and they give me a lot of respect. No matter if I have my hand in their pocket, you know. But being I know what to do, you know, being hip enough to know, I do it. It's love and peace. Love and peace. You just gotta keep sending it out, love and peace. Love that love and peace. I'm not J for nothing, you know. (gentle music) Excuse me, ma'am? Where's the safe? What? We're here for the safe. Does Harry know about this? Yeah, Harry phoned us this morning and said we pick up the safe. Says it's behind the cash register. I don't know anything about picking up a safe. Look, I made a special trip up here with the schvartze. Harry didn't tell me anything about it. Harry didn't tell you anything about it? No. Okay, come on. Harry didn't tell her anything about it. Well, if Harry didn't tell you anything about it, then you explain it to Harry, okay? Hey, wait a minute, mister. Wait, wait, wait, come back. Harry doesn't always tell me everything. I only work here part-time, a couple of nights a week because my husband just had an operation. [J] I'm sorry to hear that. It was terrible, he had a growth in his rear end. Oh, that can be very painful. You're telling me, lays around the house all day long complaining. Get me this, get me that. Get me this, get me that. Have you tried an enema? Mister, the last thing in the world that my husband needs right now is an enema. I didn't meant your husband, have you tried an enema? Me? - Have I tried an enema? - Yeah. Are you kidding? (woman giggles) Have I tried an enema? (J giggles) You gotta be crazy, have I tried an enema? (both giggle) Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, sweetheart. - Hey, but what about Harry? - Yeah. What about Harry? What shall I tell him? Tell him to take an enema. (woman giggles) (men chattering) Hey, Harry. What is it? Harry, the guys were just here and they picked up the safe. What? Stop that man, help! Stop that man, police! Police! (wheels clacking) (metal thudding) (tires screeches) (horns honking) (train wheels clacking) (wheels screeching) (door whooshes) (hand thuds) J! J! (wheels clacking) (upbeat music) Hi. (siren blaring) Hi. Can I have a lift? Where are you going? Home. Where's home? It's not very far. Get in. You really have a lot of keys. (Parm clears throat) My goodness, this your car? Yeah. A lot of plastic. Yeah. I asked for leather all over here and they gave me vinyl. Right. But it's better to have a car than not to have a car. That's true. Would you? Would you like a key? (Parm giggles) I'll bet this is your car. - Right. - Right. Do you want the key that starts the car or do you - prefer the challenge. - No, I prefer the challenge. (Parm giggles) I prefer the challenge of trying to find the keys out of this. Can I try it? (J coughs) Did you try this one yet? Yes, that's the first one I tried. Actually, that's the key to my locker at the gym. - This key here. - Your locker at the gym? Yes, I bet you don't know what this key is. That's Frank's locker at the gym. No, no, actually, it's Bruce's locker. (Parm giggles) This is Frank's. (Parm giggles) Where we sure are hitting it off. (Parm giggles) (gentle music) (car engine revving) (Parm giggles) (keys jingle) Nervous? Me, nervous? Are you nervous? - [Parm] I am. - (door clicks) (door creaks) Whoo! You rich? [Parm] Why? Does it matter? All right, this is a stick-up. (Parm giggles) No, no, no. No, no, no. I want your diamonds and your minks and your credit cards and your whatnot. (Parm giggles) Take everything. [J] Everything? (cat meows) Come here, Kitty. Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, kitty. (cat meows) (Parm giggles) This is my cat, Nathan. How are you, Nathan? (cat meows) (Parm giggles) He doesn't like you. (Parm giggles) He's very talkative. (Parm giggles) That's okay, I like you. - Do you? - Mm-hmm. What has four legs and chases cats? I don't know. Mrs. Katz and her lawyer. Oh, that's very sad. You're a married man. What? (Parm giggles) What? You're a married man. No, not really. Not really, no. Why? What happened? She was sneak cheating. I came home one day, there was this guy in the closet on his knees with a cigar in his mouth. (J scoffs) He said, "This ain't what you think." I said, "I don't care what it is, pal, just don't do nothing in front of the kids." [Parm] You have kids. Oh, yeah. [Parm] How many? Oh, nine, 10. 10 or 11. About two. Where are they now? I don't know. (Parm sighs) You're a loner? Oh, no. I got a lot of friends. (lips smack) [Parm] I really like you. [J] What? [Parm] I said, I really like you. Yeah, yeah. I'm a charmer. [Parm] I think you're nifty. Nifty? [Parm] I mean, nice, I can tell you're nice. [J] I'm a natural. That's cute. Thank you. You look like Little Miss Muffet. Why? My breasts are too small? Too small for what? (J whistles) (Parm giggles) What are you doing? I really don't know. (Parm giggles) You're wearing your socks to bed. Yeah. That's a very bad sign. It means you're going to leave quick. Oh, yeah. You always wear your sweater to bed? Yeah, well, I think my breasts are too small. What? Kiss it. Kiss it? I love to have my arms kissed. (gentle music) What's so great about that? (gentle music) "Born to win." Are you born to win? You better believe it. What's that? That's where I get my vitamin shots. Vitamin, vitamin B52. It's good for my memory. You got a nice body on you. [Parm] You don't think my breasts are too small? [J] Yeah. They're bigger than mine. (Parm giggles) Parm. (car engine revving) Geek, my man. The name is Vivian, dope fiend. How're ya doing, JJ? You know, I'd like to take care of you. A friend of mine should be coming by. I have a job for you. No, man, I can't. This is easy. All you have to do is take a package from person A to person B. What do you want from me? Want? You're the one who wants. Man, you got everything. You got your chicks, you got your limousine. Give me a few bags on credit. Oh, JJ. Man, you've got my wife hustling for you. You want her with some spade? You know there's nothing lower than a junkie chick, JJ. Come on. Come on. Come on, now. She'll be very happy to see you. We'll do some work and then I'll fix you up. (suspenseful music) (doorbell dings) (door clicks) - Hi, JJ, how are you? - Hi, Marlene. - How are you? - How are you? Good. What can I do? I got something for Stanley. Ooh, un petit moment, mon cheri. You're looking good. [Marlene] Thank you, you too. Stanley, it's JJ. Hi, JJ. How are you, Stanley? I got something for you. You got something for me? A little taste? You'll get yours from the Geek. You know, the Geek, Stanley. Hey, listen. About Marlene's hair. I was looking at it. She's got kind of a, well, she's got kind of a Bronx look, you know, Stanley. I was thinking I could give her a more of a Manhattan look, you know. Like a cap cut, you know. What? A cap cut, you know, like Sassoon. Vidal Sassoon. It's very in, Stanley. Bye, JJ, see you around. (door clicks) (gentle music) (car door clicks) (upbeat music) Geek? Geek, buddy. Geek. Geek? Don't forget me. My geek. - Geek, we had a deal. - Oh, J. - [J] You promised. - Where have you been? You know where I've been. Was it difficult? No, kick cold turkey, lay around in jail 18 months, nothing. I'm sorry. How are the kids? They're with my mother in California. Geek, you got something for me? Vivian's the name, JJ. Right. Then let's hear it. Vivian. (gentle music) (crowd chattering) (man sings indistinctly) [Man] You haven't been around for a while, J. I took a bust. Yeah, I heard about that. Some junkie chick ratted on you. Yeah. Well, it's them junkie chicks, J. What can I say? Okay. (gentle music) Why did you let me catch that fall? You were supposed to watch over me. I dream about you almost every night. Even in jail. Can I come back to you? No, J. Why did you mess me up like this? Why? Why? [J] Geek. You owe me some money. You got yours in dope. Four lousy bags. I never thought you'd turn on a friend. Who's a friend? I'm an acquaintance. Geek. (men chattering) You're messing with some bad people, man. All right, so there's a fortune in dope up there, you know, but to deliver the dope one day and take the cat off the next, man, you gotta be insane. Billy, I've gotta hit big and clear out. That guy Stanley, what's his thing, man? What is he into? Businessman, regardless. He's strictly a profiteer. He don't even use. (doorbell dings) Are you sure the dude's out? [J] Shh! Qui est lá? [J] Mr. Charm. JJ. (Marlene giggles) [J] You guessed it. - Hiya. - [J] Hi. - Stanley isn't home. - [J] I know. (Marlene giggles) You wanna come in? [J] It's up to you. Okay, come in. This is my friend. He's black, you don't mind black folks, do you? No. Does he have a name? Do you have a name? Just call me the bogeyman. Just sit over there. Sit, sit, sit. So, Stanley's out on the island? - Mm-hm, business. - Business. He's all business, that Stanley. - Mm-hmm. - (Marlene scoffs) I wanna pick up that package that I dropped off yesterday. You what? The package. I want it back. (Marlene giggles) You got your money, JJ. Somebody else got the money, I got kadoches. Yeah, well, that's your business. I have nothing to do with that. Marlene, this is a take-off. (Marlene giggles) You gotta be kidding. No, I'm not kidding. This is a take-off. Come on, Marlene, give me the goodies, come on. Oh, listen, - I don't know where the. - Now, look, lady, if you don't own up to that package, I'm gonna take all your furs and jewels and shove 'em down your throat. That's about the size of it, Marlene. Hey, listen, you're not gonna hurt me, are you? No, no, I'm not a violent person. I'm all peace and love. Oh, JJ, Stanley's gonna kill me. Stanley always had a lousy attitude. Come on. (bell clangs) Would you give me a taste? I didn't know you indulged. Stanley doesn't even know. No, man. I think some other time is better, Marlene. Boy... C'est la vie, Marlene. - Let's go, JJ! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cops. All right, freeze! Police. Oh, look, baby. We got guns, baby. (footsteps tapping) Split up! Get him! (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) [Eddie] Hold it! (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music) (door clicks) (washing machine engine whirring) Did you get your rocks off? Not yet. I'm gonna get 'em off now. [Danny] Eddie? [Eddie] I'm in here, Danny, I got one. I lost the other one, but I got the package here. Come on, spread 'em. I got a freako with an attitude. Uh-huh. I know him, it's JJ. - How ya doin', J? - Move it. Come on. Not too good, man. I got him up on a stick-up, what was it? '67, '68. I had him cold. He talked and he walked, didn't you, babe? That's the name of the game. Talk and walk. Yeah, you should have done five years minimum at least on that, J. I had nothing to do with that. These guys came up from Florida. I told you, I introduced them to a party and this party beats "em. So in retaliation they made up this story that J and a friend of his got these ice picks, and stuck 'em up and took $800 outta their backpack, which is ridiculous. Anyway, there's some smack here. Hi, lady. Well, lady, we're making an arrest. You might stepping outside if you want. I don't care what you're doing, the things people are doing in this house, you wouldn't believe. You guys are embarrassing me. All right, I've had enough of your lip, J. We'll I take a little walk in the hallway. Where are we going? Hey, lady! Lady, it's police brutality, lady! - [Eddie] Come on. - They're gonna beat me up! We're gonna put you on ice for a long time, J. Danny? Danny? Give me a break, will ya? I'm trying to wipe jones completely out of me. (J sobbing) Come on, come on, get up. I'm slipping up in my jail time. Three months here and five months there. I just pulled a year and a half up at Danbury. I'm only out three months, Danny. God, I'm tired, man. I'm just physically tired. Don't chain me up. Please, don't chain me up, Danny. Hey, look. Hey, J, look. J, look, you're gonna have to take a big fall, baby, you know. You wanna play, you gotta pay, baby, you know that. When you pitch, J, you gotta catch. - Please, please. - Now, come on. (J sobbing) (gentle music) Cool, nice and cool, that's it. [Eddie] How about the Geek? Come on, J, you know the Geek, don't you? Yeah, I know him. But where does he hang out? Open End, 77th and 1st. We're gonna get the Geek, J, and you're gonna get him for us. Do you understand? All right. From now on, you're gonna keep on walking and talking, baby. (J groaning) Ow. Hi, sweetheart. What kind of freak idea was that? Taking poor Stanley off. I never did that. You're really, really in trouble with him, JJ. Oh, what did he say? Well, he wants to pass you a hot shot. Strychnine, battery acid. Take your choice. What can I say? Stanley wants to ice you. Screw him where he breeds. So I've been racking my brain. What can I do for JJ? Give him a nice score, 500, 1,000. You'd do that for me? But first you have to do a little job for me. Geek, if I could break out of this town, man, I'd kiss your feet. Not here, J. Just do the job. Right, right. Drive out to Kennedy Airport tomorrow morning. 9AM, flight from Paris. Wear a red tie. What's it worth? 20 years. I know that, man. I mean my price. 800. And a few bags. (J chuckles) I'm not addicted, I'm habituated. You know? Tomorrow, when I get the money from the guy, we're gonna get out of here. We're gonna take a trip and I'm gonna get clean. Like that. "Cause, you know, it's the environment that Kills you. You know, it's these greasy junkies that I gotta hang out with, you know and whatnot. You can't trust any of them. I trust you. You could ask me anything. How many men you gone to bed with? 60? Who's that? Me over there? Who's the little guy on the end? (Parm giggles) I didn't see you for two days. Did you like him? I loved him. Oh, J! I was just kidding about all those men, J! Don't you know that's you? Just a natural born freak collector, aren't you? You're tiptoeing around junk now because you think it's so hip. Now, pretty soon, you'll wanna be dipping and dabbing, and then you'll end up with a habit, and take your tail out in the street and you'll be selling it for junk. J, don't want all those things to happen. I want us to be like regular people. I'm sorry. I'm a little moochy. Do you have to do this? Sometimes I feel I just wanna turn my head around, you know. You know, I'm a very boring guy when I'm straight. (gentle music) Kitty. Oh, yes. Yes. (car engine revving) Where are you going? Wait for me. Where are you going? I have to take care of that job, I told you. - I'm coming. - No, you can't come. - Oh, yes, I can. - No, you can't. Listen. I'm only gonna be gone a couple of hours. I'll be back with a lot of money and then we can do anything we want. I don't believe you. Don't you trust me? No, let's go. Wait a second. If they catch you, it's gonna be 20 years. You're gonna be in jail for 20 years. If you don't let me go with you, I'm gonna scream all over the city. No, you're not. Ahh. (Parm screaming) (plane engine revving) (gentle music) (car engine revving) (plane engine revving) (gentle music continues) He's completely dead, that guy. Listen, you know that for $342, we can get a round-trip ticket to Bermuda? [J] For two? Yup, we can go right away. Look, I gotta deliver the package, pick up my pay and then we're off. Okay. (gentle music) (car engine revving) I'm looking for Ray. Third floor, number 47. (car engine revving) Spooky. (knuckles rapping) What is that, Mafia? No Mafia. Business people. Square, respectable business people, let's go. (car engine revving) (tires screeching) God, they're cutting us off. Move it! (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) Baby, get outta here! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music continues) (both grunt) [Stanley] Where's my goods? I don't. I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya. A friend of mine's got 'em. [Stanley] Where is he? He's around town, upside down. (J grunts) I need a phone. Take me to a phone. [Stanley] Tell him you've got a buyer, we'll pick him up. (J breathes heavily) Okay. Is Billy Dynamite there? He's not there. That's the best I could do. Take your clothes off. What? Take your clothes off. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. When I get my package, maybe you get your clothes. Everything. Put him in the room in back. Hey, listen. You know, he's a junkie. He may not be back for days. Well, I guess you got a streak of bad luck, J. (J grunts) Hello. And look at this. Yes! Is that your mother? Oh, yes! (J growling) Yes, call the police, yes! Come in, Stanley. You got a light? Get off the bed. Oh. [Man] What's he doing in there?

(bell clanging) Hey, buddy, what do you get for this? (door thuds) (car whooshes) (horn honks) (Parm giggling) I'm sorry. It's just that I was so scared. I thought they'd killed you. I was set up. The Geek set me up. I don't understand it. I keep getting beat. I keep getting beat, I'm sick of it! I'm sick of it. We can go away somewhere. We can get in the car and go anywhere. Right away.
