When will he finally stop begging to join us? You? When did you stop sleeping with your parents? I won't be long. I was so happy with you! I loved you so much! Me too. But it can't be helped. Anne-Marie, I never asked you... You're so discrete, Nobody! I lived with a very nice man for two years, but in the end I realised I was better off on my own. I have a friend who is gay. I have a lot of fun with him, He was the one who insisted me to take my medication again. I do feel calm now - but it's like I've run out of energy. What about your money? What you send is enough for me. I also give English lessons. You? How's it going? - You mean English? - Yes. Well, nothing to brag about. "I am in my boat. What do I need?" "I am in my bath" Do you remember when we went to New York with Jean-Pierre? You went out with him, and I decided to take a bath. And there were no towels. Then called the maid and you asked her: "I am in my boat. What do I need?" What fun we had then! Yes. It was fun. See you tomorrow. See you at the hospital. There are plenty of fakes around. You have to know who to buy from, And you, you're a serious merchant? If you can prove that you bought a fake, I'll give you your money back. It's terribly interesting. But I don't understand art, Well, you just find a good merchant. I will advise you. Thank you. Do you need a lot of money to get started? No, not necessarily, Here, come to my gallery. When you come, you'll see for yourself. I have the right literature. Everyone starts with books. - But I'm not much of a reader. - You'll be looking at pictures. Would you give me your number? Well, all right. Do you even know what time it is?! Where have you been? And with whom? With Michael Yoon. - Who? - Who else is he? Michael Yoon! Don't you know the comedian Michael Yoon?! You've not seen "The 11 Commandments"? He's my new client... He came into our shop, we got to talking... I gave him some advice. Then he invited me to his play, then looked at his collection. So-so collection. Well, there you go. And so the time flew by, And then I drove home. So, what's the big deal? Why didn't you call? I was worried, - Oh listen, do you believe this nonsense? - You don't believe me? Ok. He lies without blushing! Look at him! So I'm lying, am I? Hello, Michael? Did I wake you up? This is Alain, the owner of the African gallery. Excuse me... My wife adores you. She and I agreed that I would spend with you all evening. Can I give her the phone? All right. Well, ask him, ask him. Hello! Are you really Michael Yoon? Yes, only it's not Michael, it's Michael. Did you really spend spent the evening with my husband? Yes, madam. Your husband is a great dancing. He's great. Thank you, monsieur. Good night. - Well? What did he tell you? - Well? Are you going to sleep with us? Ah, Judith, finally! Yes, I'm very happy too. Yes, of course, me too. I'm so looking forward to seeing you. When would be a good time for you? Where are you? I'll be right there. Sabina, look after Segan. Why did it take you so long to call? I had to think about it. I knew: If I called, there was no going back! For me too. So that's it - no return. Where shall we go? As you like. - Shall we go shopping? - Great. - Only now it's raining... - Well, yes, it's drizzling a little. Good. What a nice bracelet. Excuse me! We would like to see the bracelet. - Certainly - It's yours. - Don't. - It would be my pleasure, - No, really, don't. The ring! I love it. I will definitely buy it. Yeah, we're going to have to do to make some serious repairs. Just repaint the walls. Lights, heating installed recently. There is an alarm. What do you trade in? Exotic jewellery, coral. Artist's work... Skirts, scarves... Great. No problem. - Items of African art. - A what-what? If it suits you, we we can make a contract. - Great, I'll meet you tonight. - I'll see you in our office then. Well, that's not bad, is it? What do you think? Satisfied? Yes, but we will see each other less often. Oh, well... Better seldom than well. By the way, you said something in there about African art... Do you want to compete with me? No, it's not. It's just that a buddy of mine makes copies. Although they do look just like the real thing. Is that so? You'll be selling originals, and I'll deal in copies, I adore you. Hello! Let's take temperature and blood pressure, So, Julien, how are we feeling today? Better? Not bad, thank you. Honey, I'm going out for a bit. - How's that? - It's just awful, - How is he? - He's a little better, - Does he know? - Not yet. Look, there's Isabel with my son. - I have to go back. - Of course, go to them. No, no. I want us to have lunch with you. Can you do it? Yes, but... Don't leave them here. No, I want to have lunch with you. - Wait, I won't be long. - Take your time, I'll be right back. Noble Wanderer, would you like a portrait with a sphinx as a memento? Why not? It would brighten up my shack. Let's go. There he is. Turn around, straighten your your shoulders and don't move. Look: there he flopped. "Bravo, Bravo" - Julien is tired. - I'll be off. I have a client waiting for me. - Are you tired of me? - No, not tired at all. I guess I'll have to have to have lunch with him, Please don't leave them alone. Have lunch together. - See you tomorrow, my dear, kisses. - Yes, me too. It must be from up there, a beautiful view! No, Obelix, we can't go there. Where to go? I don't know. Straight up. You don't have an address? No. Oh, oh, do not smoke in the car. Go to the park. My eldest son was in a car accident. He won't be able to walk. Plus, he's a pianist, but he has his right arm is paralyzed. I also have a 15 year old son by my second wife, whom I adore. I love her, but now I'm in love with someone else. Should I leave my wife and sons for her? I'm lost... Hello. Ah, I speak with you! I'm sorry for just now. I got sick. Do you want to have dinner together? Ah yes, all right. Do you know L'ami Louie's restaurant? On Rue Verbois. OK? Great, see you then. Kisses. I should have stumbled across them! Are you uncomfortable? It doesn't really matter. It's just that I wanted to hold your hand. There's still time, - Who's he having lunch with? - Probably with a customer. It looks like a romantic couple. I don't know, I'm not familiar with her, A light flirtation boosts tone. How did you explain to your husband about going out tonight? Nothing. He has moved into a hotel. We can't sleep together, fighting all the time. I told him the first day the truth. I told him I was in love, Life is a strange thing, isn't it? Until a few days ago. I thought I was in love with him, You promised me you'd fire Farida, and she still works for you! I'm going to fire her. I gave her some time, to find another job. Well, why are you being so jealous, baby girl? I'm not jealous at all. I just love you. I love you too, baby girl. I love you, too. А! Michael, it's very good to see you. Meet my wife. She's a fan of yours. What a jerk! He woke me up at 3 in the morning! On my mobile phone! Shall we? Where to? Wherever you want! Hello, we would like to We'd like to rent a room. Sorry, all the rooms are occupied. Wait! We have to disable the alarm. I'm so happy to be with you like this! He's waiting for us. Hello. Hello. Can you raise your hand? Wel done. A little higher on the wrist. Very good, I will tell you what you're going to have to do. There are 3 operations possible. The first is for you to be able to straighten your arm. The second is to clench your fist, the third to unclench it. We'll take healthy muscle and transplant it in the place of the paralysed. And then I can move my arm? Partial. You will be able to hold a glass, a fork, call on the phone. Everything else depends on your efforts. You can count on me, Doctor. How much longer is he going to be here? Depends on him. Possibly a couple of months. And then? I'll take him back to our place. He will be better off at my place in winter. Daddy, look, I can move. That's great, my dear. Here, eat. Thank you. Yeah, that's it. Now this way, more, more, stop. That's it. Wow, it's been three months of work, Your artist friend is doing great. - Where's that from? - Senegal. It's very beautiful. We haven't been out in a while, honey. It used to be risky. But things are different now. - What's changed"? - Well, you'll see... For example, come with me to dinner with clients. You're going to have to tell her anyway. Of course, but we've already managed to clear all suspicion about you. Gradually things will settle down. It's been so long since we made love. A few oral exercise after all. Have you thought about me? Well, let's do it tomorrow night, I have a surprise for you. Really? Which one? - You'll see tomorrow. - No, baby, tell me now. - Take a guess. - I can't guess! I bought new underwear. This is not good. Let's go away. She's never here in the aftrnoon. She arrives at dinner time. Cedric is at school and in the evening he has a music lesson. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'll show you the Prouvé table I told you about. Come in. Look, it's Sharot's desk. It's a miracle. Have a seat. Look, it's like a real sculpture. Danielle, I don't feel well. I'm going to go now. Don't worry: she's gone to fetch her son. Look, this is the desk I wanted to show you. Prouvé made it especially for the hostel in Antoni. Look! Look at those legs. It's amazing Can you see what the base is like? Feel it. Ah, Isabella! It's you. Meet Judith, she's writing a book about Prouvé. This is my wife Isabelle and my son Cedric. Let's go. - I have to go. - Why? What's the matter? - I'll call you tonight. - Yes, yes, call me. Who is this girl? This is the first time I've seen her. I told you she was writing a book about Prouvé. Segan directed her to me. And did you bring her here straight away? That's it. I fired her. She was furious, but I told her that things were not going well, Has she found another job yet? I don't know, it's not my problem anymore. Mum, I'm late. I'm coming! I'll make Daddy a juice and then we'll go. Bye, daughter! See you tonight. With Farida gone, Nicole can take her place. By the way, don't expect me for dinner. Who are you having dinner with? With a couple from America. Solid clients. Then take Nicole with you. Let her learn. No way, no way. She's been bothering me all day long... ...and then this evening too! Don't be nervous, my love. I'll go with you myself. All right, I'm going to get dressed, The Nigerian sculpture has already been sold. Well, all right. - Hi. - Hi. How is Farida doing? I don't know. What is it? No, just asking. It seems that she has returned home to Senegal. What's the matter? What is it? Maybe he wasn't the one who rented the shop for her. Check his chequebook - you'll see. But if this is true, then... How many times have I said: get yourself a lover! I know, but I love Alain. So what?! How many happy wives are there in the world who have lovers?! But I can't do that. Our father cheated on Mum all his life, But they still lived happily ever after! All right, then. Deal with it. Live like her. But just to be safe, check his checkbook. Don't forget your underwear! Darling! Get out! And for the lady? Orange juice. You wanted to see me? Yes. Well, I'm here. Judith, I love you. I can feel how unhappy I am. I thought you were happy with me. - Yes, of course I am. - I can see that you're not. Thank you. I think Isabelle has it all figured out. So do I. I don't want to hurt anyone... - Maybe we'd better... - I understand. Judith, I love you. Give me a kiss, I beg you, Leave me alone! Go to your wife! - Don't drink any more, - I'm not drunk. You wanted to tell me something, I can no longer remember what. Well, between your work and your friends, I hardly ever see you. You leave early in the morning, you come back late at night, You know I can't I can't live without a job. We stopped making love. Do you miss it so much? We've been together for so long. In the evenings you disappear with your friends. - Join us. - The theatre bores me. What else do you have against me? Nothing. I'm just unhappy, that's all, This is serious. Remember when I said I might meet someone? Have you met her? Not yet... Maybe... When you meet her, let me know. Consider yourself warned. Are you saying that... What? So that means... I think I must have fallen in love. That young girl who came here? Yes. How long have you known her? A little over three months. But I still love you. Still?! Don't touch me! Can't you love two women at the same time? Not with me! Live as you like. And if in six months... What if I promise that I won't I wouldn't see her? I don't believe you. It's just words. I know you. - But I swear! - You don't have to swear! SLUT. - Are you still making love to him? - In the last 2-3 months, many times. - Which one of you makes the first move? - Always him. You start on your own. Don't lag behind with him. In the morning and in the evening. A woman always has more ways to attract. What if he doesn't want to? Give him a blow job. No man has yet to give up a blow job. If a man has enough sex at home, he won't go out on the side. Men love the depraved, you can trust me on that. Better yet, make him jealous, He cheated on you, you cheat on him. It has nothing to do with love. Do you think it's so important to be faithful? Let me introduce you to someone. With whom? You'll see. He's very nice. You'll spend the evening with him, I'll have everything ready by seven. For 150 guests. Yeah, out of 300 people invited. half of them aren't coming. Are you going for coffee? Thank you, I've had I've already had two drinks. No, no, we'll stay at least until at least until ten o'clock. I've made a list of people to call. Have you seen it? Okay. SLUT Slut. Did you see what it says on your car? Again?! - Give me a rag. - I've had it! Calm, calm down. I love you, my baby, I love you Closer. Pull up to the table. Slow down. Watch your balance. Carry the lower part of the torso. Watch your feet. - Are you all right? Is it hard for you? - No, of course not. I can't drive on grass myself. My mother went to Switzerland. She asked the designer to redo the bathroom just for me. - Will you and Daddy come and visit me? - Of course we will. Look, Dad! I'll go. No, stay with us. I have to go. I have a meeting. Stay! Leaving? Stay, please. No, I have to go. Judith, look at me. I told Isabelle everything. She knows I love you. I don't want you to get hurt because of me. I don't care. I am tired of hiding in corners. Of making love in hiding. I have the right to live normally, Yes, you're right. Yes. I made up my mind on the first day. - How are you? - I'm fine. Daddy, what about Judith? What about her? - Do you talk to each other? Then what is the problem? It's nothing. I'm just a coward. I should have packed my bags and gone to her place. So do it. It's not that easy. Yes, Julien, I'm listening. You can't go away. I can't go on, I'm tired. Well, at least give it time. I mean, you're meant to be for each other, I'm sure. Come back now, please. Come back. I'm passing you over to daddy. You said all the right things. But I can't live without you. Come back, my love. I'm waiting for you. PRIMITIVE ART GALLERY - Do you have a gallery? - Yes. - Where? - On the corner of Bozar Street. You know, I'm an artist. I create Fang wooden sculptures. The only difference from the real thing is the price. What a cheek! He invited her too! Leaving already? No, I went out to get some air. It's so hot inside. - Has Daniel arrived yet? - I don't know. He will come for sure. Isabelle, hello, darling. How are you? Good. Meet my husband. - It's a pleasure. - Is Danielle here yet? Not yet. But he will come for sure. It's five to nine. He has to be here before nine. - You're not going to leave me, are you? - No, of course not. This is a statue from Easter Island. It's a very rare item, I bought it at an auction. Must be worth a fortune, Given its background... Yeah, I've seen a lot of that junk out there, But the prices are steep. How much are you asking? There he is! What am I going to tell Alain? That you're having dinner with your mum. He'll be glad of his freedom. Xavier, this is my sister Fanny. - I told you about her. - It's good to see you. Let's go to the buffet. We'll talk better there. The end of the 19th century. Truly rare specimen. It's from his collection. Just look at it, Look at the impassive expression on his face. Really amazing. Well? I'll see you tonight? It's not going to happen today. But tomorrow afternoon we are going to Zurich with Hubert. You take me with you? Of course. I already have your ticket. You could have dinner together. Are you free tonight? Dinner? Yes, I'm free. Do you like steak and blood? I don't eat meat at all. Oh, well, then you'll order the fish. Aren't you going to undress? - Right now? - sure. Or do you like doing it with your clothes on? No! You know, for me, the most important thing in life is love. He was 18, handsome and clean as a baby, But strong as a man. Ouch! No, you're hurting me, You're hurting me! Let me go! You're so fat. Are you going to leave me just like that? Well, will you at least give me a blow job? Let's go, Joko. We're leaving. I love you. I love you. And I love you, darling. What's the matter with you? I cheated on you. Cheated! Well, it's no big deal, With whom? What do you mean it's "no big deal"? If it's just a physical hobby, there's nothing wrong with it. Well, tell us what it was like... Bastard! Bastard! - Was this your first time? - It was. Well, after 18 years of fidelity, that's to be expected! You disgust me. Well, give me a kiss. Don't touch me. - Well, why do you take your stockings off? - Because! What do you mean by "because"? I didn't do it. I didn't cheat on you. There! Are you happy? No, I'm not happy. So did you cheat on me or not? - Almost. - Almost? At the last moment, I couldn't. Why couldn't you? Because I love you, OK? Yes. But what's that got to do with it? You bastard! You're nothing! My mother told me everything! And in vain, Cedric. - Listen to me... - No, you listen to me! Let go! Don't you ever meet with that woman again! You're just a child, Cedric. Don't get involved in adult things. I am no longer a child! Think of how many of your friends live in broken homes! I don't care! Not me! You should know that I still love your mum. If you love her, don't leave us. I haven't gone anywhere yet. Mum hurried off. No, she was to tell me. Mum was right. I'm so sick of everything! I'm sick of this life! Don't say that. Life is beautiful. You'll understand when you grow up. Maybe you'll get married yourself, have kids yourself, and then suddenly you fall in love with another woman. I don't want children. Cedric, give me a kiss. No. Come here, give me a kiss. If you promise you won't go back to that woman, I'll kiss you. Again?! Every single day. I can't go on like this! - Come on, let's rent a parking space. - I don't want your parking space. - Then don't leave the car here. - Is that all you have to say?! But baby... Open up, baby. My baby. Open for me, please. Don't be silly, baby, open up. You disgust me, You're a coward. I don't want to see you again. But I love you. I don't believe you anymore. It's your choice: You're with me or you're with her. Either a divorce or we break up, I can't get a divorce, baby. I wouldn't be able to see my daughter. Then stay with your wife and daughter. But I can't live without you. I can't. Let me introduce you. I'm sure you'll get on well with her, Are you making fun of me? Something tells me... - What's the matter with you? - I don't feel well. - What is it? - An anti-depressant. A doctor prescribed it for me. Yes, baby? I can't talk, I'm with a client. I'll call you back. I'll talk to her. I don't believe you. I like the way you smell. They say it's the smell. I like the way you smell too. I like all of you. Do you like my breasts? You have lovely breasts. Very pretty breasts. I don't like big sizes. And you also have a nice ass. Yes, it's true. My ass is beautiful. I haven't told you yet... Isabel told Cedric everything. Let's not see each other again. You know that's impossible. I'm sure that, in time. he'll understand me. It is not for him to decide how to live my life. Sooner or later the children realise that. I shouldn't have told you... No, you have to tell me everything. When Cedric meets you, he'll understand me. And when is that? To the table! Everything is ready. I'm not hungry. Well, for once in my life. I come home for lunch... Come on, it'll calm you down. What are you taking? Here, give it to me. Are you taking Tranxen now? I haven't been feeling well lately. The doctor has prescribed me... What's wrong with you? Tell me about it. I can't live like this any more, - Is this about us? - I can't live a double life. I cheat you, her... Darling, you need to make up your mind. A choice has to be made. That's easy to say! You women are stronger than us. You can make up your minds. I can't. Well, what do you want to do? I want you to get to know each other. I'm sure you will get on very well. What?! Yes, a menage a trois agreement, I know families that work well like that. How could you suggest that to me? That's disgusting! Oh, come on. I mean, you and I have been together for 18 years... I wish you'd have had the courage and ask for a divorce. But I don't want a divorce. I do. I'm going to the hospital. The doctor found me a place in a good clinic. Is it that bad for you? I'm depressed. I don't want you you and Emily to see me like this. It's up to you. Do you want me to go with you? Yes, please. Why don't you eat something? I don't feel like it. I have to think about it. Think carefully. No, Aisha, you can't smoke in here. Give me a cigarette. - I won't. I smoke it. - There's a smoking room over there. Go over there. I want to finish the game. I'm smoking. Don't stop me from smoking! Aisha, don't break the rules. I warned you yesterday. Let's go. I don't care, I want to smoke. You have a smoke in the smoking room. Give me that cigarette! I don't want to smoke in there! - What's his name, then? - Alain Hello, Pierre! How are you? My name is Alain. Oh, I'm sorry. What's happening to you? Doctor, my life is a nightmare. I love my wife. I also love another woman. The wife wants a divorce, I don't. The other one says 'divorce'. I'm just at a loss. I feel so guilty in front of them. Well, it's a classic case. A conflict of desires and possibilities. It's always depressing. Three Xanax tablets and start a course of treatment with Effexor. You'll feel better soon, don't worry. Keep your chin up. Have courage. - See you soon, Pierre. - Alain. Our friend, Van Morisson, in his songs, acts as a realist, even a bit of a pessimist. I mean, it's pretty much my case. Alain, tell me... Is this your first time in this hospital? - Yes I can't say that about myself. Unfortunately, that's not the case I have been treated here for 25 years... - A visitor is here to see you. Did she say her name? Madame Sissé. Tell her I'm not accepting anyone. Not even for five minutes? Sorry, that's not possible. I've decided that I won't be with Farida again. - Are you sure? - I'm certain Not with her, not with the others. I won't even look! Put Marilyn Monroe into my arms. But she's already dead, darling! Well, it's just a... a figure of speech, You need a faithful husband. I'm done with sex for me, - Even with me? What if I wear stockings and a belt? Let's see. Dad. Where is Mum? I don't know, daughter. In the kitchen. She's not there. Well, maybe she's gone to to look for croissants. All right, Emily! Close the door! I want to rest. Go on, go on. - Play the backing track! - What did you say? Turn on the tape! There's a spacious living room, the dining room, and there are three bedrooms. All with windows to the terrace. Would you like to take a look? Ok. See how roomy this lift is? Julien will be comfortable. Julien's bedroom. And this one is for Cedric. That's where he'll put his desk... And this one is for us. - Do you like it? - I do. What's up? I need to talk to you. Nothing serious? ... it is I promised you I would never to fall in love, but... I couldn't resist. I cracked up. She's so beautiful. And what an ass! Do you want to see her ass? I thank you, but I'd rather not look at it, No, you just have to to see that ass. It's very important for that you see her ass. Let's go. Come here. You've see. It's a miracle. Just see her ass! Look at that! Look, you see? Look, look... How the curves arise! Look, look at that ass. Look at that ass! Look, Joko! My dear! Would you like it narrower? - It's a metre forty. - It's here. - This one's 6'4"? - Yeah. The advantage is at least we will be closer to each other! Bye. Bastard!!! Where are you?! Why? Why are you prying into my life? Why? You still have a mother! I am a living person! What difference does it make to you? What difference does it make? Millions of children in the world... millions of similar families getting divorced. Why me? Why do you attack me? Why? But why? Why? Eh? Tell me why. Tell me... OK, go... Leave me alone. Is everything all right? Yes [Judith (Charlotte Gainsboroug) singing...] Have they forgotten their promises? Ont-ils oublié leurs promesses? [Judith (Charlotte Gainsboroug) singing...] At the slightest laugh, at the slightest gesture Au moindre rire, au moindre geste Great loves no longer have an address Les grands amours n'ont plus d'adresse When one goes and the other stays Quand l'un s'en va et l'autre reste Is it only a youthful sin? N'est-il péché que de jeunesse? Has it happened that nothing leaves? N'est-il passé que rien ne laisse? Great loves are in distress Les grands amours sont en détresse When one leaves and the other stays Lorsque l'un part et l'autre reste Stay at your house Reste chez toi Grow old without me Vieillis sans moi Don't call me anymore Ne m'appelle plus Erase me Efface-moi Tear up my letters Déchire mes lettres And stay there Et reste là Tomorrow maybe Demain peut-être You will come back Tu reviendras Gesture of love and tenderness Geste d'amour et de tendresse Like two intoxicated birds Tels deux oiseaux en mal d'ivresse Great loves no longer have an address Les grands amours n'ont plus d'adresse When one goes and the other stays Quand l'un s'en va et l'autre reste Are they upset when they hurt you? Sont-ils chagrins dès qu'ils vous blessent? In the aftermath of clumsiness Au lendemain de maladresse Great loves are in distress Les grands amours sont en détresse When one leaves and the other stays Lorsque l'un part, et l'autre reste Of sad farewells De tristes adieux So many illusions Que d'illusions If it's a game Si c'est un jeu It will be no Ce sera non Give me back my letters Rends-moi mes lettres And stay there Et reste là Tomorrow maybe Demain peut-être You will understand Tu comprendras Of sad farewells De tristes adieux So many illusions Que d'illusions If it's a game Si c'est un jeu It will be no Ce sera non Give me back my letters Rends-moi mes lettres And stay there Et reste là Tomorrow maybe Demain peut-être You will understand Tu comprendras They won't forget their promises Ils n'oublieront pas leurs promesses They will write to the same addresses Ils s'écriront aux mêmes adresses Great loves recognize each other Les grands amours se reconnaissent When one leaves and the other stays... Lorsque l'un part et l'autre reste... [Subtitles re-translated, re-synced & corrected by JJ] [English and French Song lyrics added by JJ]
