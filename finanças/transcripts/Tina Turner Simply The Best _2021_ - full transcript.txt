[gentle music] - It's 20 years later, I think, probably a little bit more and a lot has happened since the stage life and my life changed. I had sicknesses and I moved from America to Switzerland. And retirement set in and things changed. [gentle music] - [Narrator] The queen of rock and roll herself. The indomitable, Tina Turner. [audience cheering] - Who are you here to see today? - [Crowd] Tina. - That's right. - [Narrator] Her incredible life and career is like a roller coaster ride of indescribable highs and unimaginable lows. She has overcome hardship with an infectious love for life and a perspective on existence that transcends her music. - Some people called me afoolish woman. I think it took a smart woman to live with a man and to live in that situation. [gentle upbeat music] Every now and then there was some fun. Why I felt so comfortable leaving America was because everyone treated me not as a black person, they treated me just as a star. - [Narrator] With over 100 million records, Turner is one of the best selling record artists of all time. She has received 12 Grammy awards which include eight Competitive Awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She was the first black artist and first female to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. - I think if I'd had as many records as The Stones, I could justify it, but two albums and having this, almost like saying, well, this because of the book it's because I've worked at it a lot. You can put 10,000 becauses on it because you don't really know why. [gentle upbeat music] People still see me as Tina, I will always be Tina to them because that they only see me on stage. - Behind the scenes, Tina was very much, she didn't want the shame of it of people knowing what was going on. [gentle upbeat music] - I'm happier than I ever thought that life would become for me. So that means that most of my hardships came while I was young, growing up in the last days when normally people suffer from old age and sickness, my happiness came, I am, I'm really thoroughly happy. [gentle upbeat music] - [Narrator] From "Proud Mary" to "What's Love Got To Do With It." Tina Turner is simply the best. - So aside of being really tired of talking about myself, I'm really proud of what my future, as a star became. I feel proud that I hold that in my hand. [gentle music] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. It's very good. I go to the doctor now once a month for them to just check, to make sure everything is going. I take medicine once a day that I have to for the rest of the life. And I did fall a couple of days ago and broke something, so I was in the wheelchair and on the crutches. But now I'm going through my sick period. And I think that will take me right into the 90s, or whatever, I'll be around for a while. [gentle music] - [Narrator] Tina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Brownsville, Tennessee, the youngest daughter of Zelma Priscilla and Floyd Richard Bullock. The family lived in the nearby rural, unincorporated community of Nutbush, Tennessee, where her father worked as an overseer of the sharecroppers at Poindexter Farm on Highway 180. She later recalled picking cotton with her family at an early age. Tina had two older sisters, Evelyn Juanita Currie and Ruby Alline Bullock. As young children, the three sisters were separated when their parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee to work at a defense facility during World War II. She went to stay with her strict, religious paternal grandparents, Alex and Roxanna Bullock who were Deacon and Deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church. After the war, the sisters reunited with their parents and moved with them to Knoxville. Two years later, the family returned to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove community, where Bullock attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade. As a young girl, Tina, sang in the church choir at Nutbush's Spring Hill Baptist Church. When she was 11, her mother Zelma ran off without warning, seeking freedom from her abusive relationship with Floyd by relocating to St. Louis in 1950. Two years after her mother left the family, her father married another woman and moved to Detroit in 1952. Tina and her sisters were sent to live with their maternal grandmother Georgeanna Currie in Brownsville, Tennessee. She stated in her autobiography, "I, Tina" that she felt her mother had not loved her and that she wasn't wanted. And that her mother had planned to leave her father when pregnant with her. "She was a very young woman "who didn't want another kid." Turner wrote. [gentle music] A self-professed tomboy, she joined both the cheerleading squad and the female basketball team at Carver High School in Brownsville and socialized every chance she got. When she was 16, her grandmother died. So she went to live with her mother in St. Louis. She graduated from Sumner High School in 1958. After her graduation, she worked as a nurse's aid at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. [gentle music] Turner began her career in 1958, appearing under the name Little Ann. And it wasn't until 1960 that she started performing as Tina Turner. [upbeat music] Tina and her sister began to frequent nightclubs in St. Louis and East St. Louis. She first saw Ike Turner perform with his band, the Kings of Rhythm at The Manhattan Club in East St. Louis. She was so impressed by his talent, recalling that she almost went into a trance watching him play. [gentle upbeat music] She asked Ike to let her sing in his band, despite the fact that few women had ever sung with him. He said, he'd call her but never did. One night in 1957, she got hold of the microphone from Kings of Rhythm drummer, Eugene Washington, during an intermission and she sang the BB King blues ballad, "You Know I Love You." Upon hearing her sing, Ike asked her if she knew more songs, she sang the rest of the night and became a featured vocalist with his band. [gentle upbeat music] During this period, he taught her the finer points of vocal control and performance. [gentle upbeat music] Tina's first recording was in 1958 under the name Little Ann on the single, "Boxtop." She is credited as a vocalist on the record alongside Ike and fellow Kings of Rhythm singer Carlson Oliver. After the release of "A Fool In Love" Ike created the Ike & Tina Turner Revue which included the Kings of Rhythm and a girl group called the Ikettes as backing vocalists and dancers. Ike put the entire Revue, through a rigorous touring schedule across the United States, performing 90 days straight in venues around the country. During the days of the Chitlin Circuit the Ike & Tina Turner Revue built a reputation as one of the most hottest, most durable and potentially most explosive of all R&B ensembles. With its show rivaling that of the James Brown Revue in terms of musical spectacle. [upbeat music] [audience cheering] [upbeat music] In 1960, Ike wrote, "A Fool In Love" for singer Art Lassiter. Tina was succinct background with Lassiter's backing vocalists the Artettes. Lassiter failed to show up for the recording session at Technisonic Studios. Since I could already paid for the studio time, Tina suggested to sing lead. He decided to use her to record a demo with the intention of erasing her vocals and adding Lassiter's at a later date. Local St. Louis disc jockey, Dave Dixon convinced Ike to send the tape to Juggy Murray, president of R&B label Sue Records. Upon hearing the song Murray was impressed with Bullock's vocals, later stating that Tina sounded like screaming dirt, it was a funky sound. Murray bought the track and paid Ike a $25,000 advance for the recording and publishing rights. Murray also convinced to make Tina the star of the show. However, family and friends still called her Ann. - People still see me as Tina, I will always be Tina to them because they only see me on stage. They're not in my home and in my private life. I don't travel a lot, I stay at home, so they can go by how I live my life here to know that, "No, oh no, she's not that way or this way." So they would know that that part of Tina is only for stage. - [Narrator] Turner likened her early relationship with Ike Turner to that of a brother and sister from another lifetime. They were platonic friends from the time they met in 1957 until 1960. Their affair began while Ike was with his live-in girlfriend, Lorraine Taylor. They became intimate when she went to sleep with him, after another musician threatened to go to her room. After recording "A Fool In Love" Turner told Ike that she didn't wanna continue their relationship. He responded by striking her in the head with a wooden shoe stretcher. Turner recalled that this incident was the first time he instilled fear in her. - Every now and then it was some fun. Sometimes it was, but I don't remember what it was, but I remember there were days that was lighter and nicer but mostly he was just a really, always angry with me, he treated me like I was a prisoner and he was the guard. - [Narrator] After the birth of their son, Ronnie, in October, 1960, they moved to Los Angeles in 1962 and married in Tijuana. In 1963, Ike purchased a house in the View Park area. They brought their son, Ronnie, Turner's son, Craig and Ike's two sons with Lorraine, from St. Louis, to live with them. Later, she revealed in "I, Tina" that Ike was abusive and promiscuous throughout their marriage, which led her to a suicide attempt in 1968 by overdosing on Valium pills. [gentle music] - When it looked like I possibly couldn't get out because I was really afraid, I planned, okay, then I'll just die because I'm really tired of everything, you know. And no hit records, being blamed for Ike not being able to come up with hit records because I wasn't singing properly. And then the one night when it really just got a bit too much where crying didn't even help, I took them all, almost like in two swallows and I didn't regret any of it. And actually when I opened my eyes, I went, excuse the expression, I'm still here. [laughing] I really had planned to leave here. [gentle upbeat music] And then I just started feeling a bit better. I said, well, that's not time yet then. So that was that experience. [gentle upbeat music] - [Narrator] She said, "It was my relationship with Ike "that made me most unhappy. "At first, I had really been in love with him. "Look what he'd done for me. "But he was totally unpredictable." Ike was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his old age. [gentle music] Due to their profitable performances, they were able to perform in front of desegregated audiences in Southern clubs and hotels. Impressed by the duos performance on The Big T.N.T Show, Phil Specter was eager to produce Turner. Working out a deal with Ike and Tina Turner's manager, Bob Krasnow, who was also head of Loma, Specter off $20,000 for creative control over the sessions to produce and have them released from their contract with Loma. They signed to Spector's Philles label in April, 1966 after Turner had already recorded with him. Their first single on his label "River Deep-Mountain High" was released in 1966. [upbeat music] ♪ And I love you honey ♪ Like a robin loves to sing ♪ I love you baby ♪ Like a school boy loves his pie ♪ ♪ I love you honey ♪ Rivers deep, mountain high ♪ Oh baby ♪ Oh baby ♪ I said baby oh ♪ Oh ♪ Yeah I love you ♪ My oh my [upbeat music] - [Narrator] The impact of the record gave I can Tina Turner an opening spot on The Rolling Stones' UK Tour in the fall of 1966. - When we was on stage, you feel it pretty strongly, because people giving you this energy. And you don't really understand, you just feel it, you don't understand really what they're trying to say, what they want, what they need from you, what they need from life, but you just feel that they need something and they're giving it to you. - [Narrator] In November, 1967, Tina became the first female and black artist to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine. The duo signed with Blue Thumb Records in 1968, releasing the album "Outta Season" in 1969. The album produced their charted cover of Otis Redding's "I've Been Loving You Too Long." Later that year, they released, "The Hunter." The title track, Albert King's, "The Hunter" earned Turner a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. [upbeat music] The success of the albums led to The Revue headlining in Las Vegas where their shows were attended by a variety of celebrities including David Bowie, Sly Stone, Janice Joplin, Cher, James Brown, Ray Charles, Elton John and Elvis Presley. [upbeat music] - Some people called me a foolish woman. I think it took a smart woman to live with a man and to live in that situation. That's the credit I give myself. But most of all, I think I was trying to say to Ike Turner, I'm your friend, I am your friend, I'm not gonna leave you, I'll stand by you. Until I found that it was being used against me. It was used to hold me there as a guilt kind of thing. - [Narrator] Their time in Las Vegas was also the beginning of a dark turn in their relationship. Ike had always been controlling and dominant. However things were about to become even worse. As the story goes, one night in Vegas, Ike was partying after one of his shows when he was offered cocaine by none other than Elvis himself. Notorious for his hard party lifestyle, Elvis had a reputation in the industry but this would be Ike's first introduction to the hard drug and he became hooked. [gentle music] Ike & Tina Turner Revue hit the mainstream with "Proud Mary" on the Ed Sullivan Show on January 11th, 1970. Their energy was unstoppable. But behind the scenes, things were falling apart. ♪ Left a good job in the city ♪ Working for the man every night and day ♪ ♪ And I never lost one minute of sleeping ♪ ♪ I was worrying 'bout the way the things might've been ♪ ♪ Big wheel keep on turning ♪ Proud Mary keep on burning ♪ Rolling, rolling ♪ Rolling down the river ♪ Rolling, rolling ♪ Rolling down the river ♪ Yeah ♪ Ooh - [Narrator] By the mid 1970s, Ike was heavily addicted to cocaine which hindered his relationship with Turner. In 1976, they headlined at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and signed a television deal with CBS TV. Ike made plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year deal with Cream Records for $150,000 per year. The deal was to be signed on July 5th. On July 1st the Turners flew from Los Angeles to Dallas, where The Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. They got into a physical altercation in route to the hotel. Shortly after arriving at the hotel, Turner fled from Mike and later hit at a friend's house. - I didn't know, that the only way out is through the door but that didn't come at the time. I just thought totally helpless. And when I was really, really, really fed up, that's when I just took a chance and said come what may, and left. I was just really tired of my life and the situation I was in with Ike. [gentle music] - [Narrator] Her dramatic escape was immortalized in the controversial film about her life, "What's Love Got To Do With It" starring Angela Bassett. This was the end of their music and their Marriage. - [Angela Bassett] I need to speak with your manager. - Yes, ma'am right away. George. - I'm Tina Turner, my husband and I just had a fight. I'm supposed to open at The Academy tonight. I have 36 cents and a mobile car. But if you would give me a room, I swear, I will pay you back. - No, no, no, that won't be necessary. Ms. Turner, I'd be honored, really. We'll take care of you. - Thank you. - [Narrator] She filed for divorce on July 27th and it was finalized on March 29th, 1978. [gentle music] In 1876 and 1977, Turner earned income by appearing on TV shows such as, "The Hollywood Squares." "Donny and Marie." "The Sonny and Cher Show." And, "The Brady Bunch Hour." As lawsuits were mounting for canceled Ike and Tina Turner gigs, Turner resumed touring to pay off her debts with finances given to her by United Artists' executive Mike Stewart. [upbeat music] ♪ I got music in me ♪ I got music in me ♪ I got music in me ♪ Yeah ♪ I feel funky ♪ Feel good ♪ I wanna jam yeah in the name of ♪ ♪ I wanna fly like a bird with wings ♪ ♪ Hold on to your hat ♪ Sing, sing, sing [gentle music] - [Narrator] In 1977 Turner re-emerged with a sexier image and costumes created by Bob Mackey. She headlined in a series of cabaret shows at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, and then took her act to smaller venues in the United States. [gentle music] In 1978, Turner released her third solo album, "Rough" on United Artists, with distribution in North America and Europe on EMI. [gentle music] That album, along with this 1979, follow-up, "Love Explosion" which included a brief diversion to disco music, failed to chart. So United Artists Records and Turner parted ways. Without the premise of a hit record, she continued performing. [gentle music] Until 1983 Turner was considered a nostalgia act, performing mostly at hotel ballrooms and clubs in the United States. She was finally given a second chance and signed with Capitol Records in 1983. In November, 1983, she released her cover of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" which was produced by BEF. The record became a hit, reaching several European charts, including number six in the UK. Following the single surprise success, Capitol Records green-lighted a studio album. Turner had two weeks to record her "Private Dancer" album which was released in May, 1984. It became an outstanding commercial success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200. And number two in the United Kingdom. "Private Dancer" was certified five times platinum in the United States and sold 100 million copies worldwide, becoming her most successful album. Also in May, 1984 Capitol issued the album's second single, "What's Love Got To Do With It." Although undoubtedly her most successful single, Tina never wanted to sing the song and admitted many times she didn't enjoy it. [gentle upbeat music] ♪ You must try to ignore that it means more than that ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it ♪ ♪ What's love but a second-hand emotion ♪ ♪ What's love got to do, got to do with it ♪ ♪ Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken ♪ - [Narrator] On September 1st, 1984, Tina achieved her first and only number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with, "What's Love Got To Do With It." The followup singles "Better Be Good To Me" and "Private Dancer" were both US Top 10 hits. Turner culminated her comeback when she won three Grammys at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Award for Record Of The Year for, "What's Love Got To Do With It." - It's that big. I think if I'd had as many records as The Stones, I could justify it. But to two albums and having this almost like saying, wow, this is because of the book it's because I've worked on. You can put 10,000 becauses on it, because you don't really know why. [gentle upbeat music] - [Narrator] Not satisfied with being one of the biggest stars in the history of music, Tina has also tried her hand at acting. She appeared in the 1975 rock musical, "Tommy" as well as the action movies "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" in 1985 and "Last Action Hero" in 1993. In 1991, Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Ike was incarcerated and Tina did not attend. Turner stated through her publicist that she was taking a leave of absence following her tour. And she felt emotionally unequipped to return to the US and respond to the night of celebration, in the manner she would want. Phil Spector accepted the award on their behalf. - Why I felt so comfortable leaving America was because everyone treated me not as a black person, they treated me just as a star. Difference, it's different than when I was there. My attitude about being there is, I had lived there the first 50 years of my life and now I'm moving to another country. Part of that was because of my relationship with Erwin. Part of that was I was always treated a little bit different in those other countries than in America, because in America, a black singer, R&B singer is always a black singer, R&B singer. I'm happier than I ever thought that life would become for me. So that means that most of my hardships came while I was young and growing up. And then the last days when normally people suffer from old age and sicknesses, my happiness came. I am, I'm really, thoroughly happy. [gentle upbeat music] I don't think he really meant for me to sing it. I don't think he really meant that anything could come from that. I don't even really think he cared to write a song for "Bond" with what he gave me. I wish I still have some of that stuff, but yeah, I knew then that I had talent to sing anything put before me. ♪ Goldeneye I found his weakness ♪ ♪ Goldeneye he'll do what I please ♪ ♪ Goldeneye no time for sweetness ♪ ♪ But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees ♪ I chill now, I mean it was, it was another feeling to sing to that. ♪ When I was You know, really to sing into that. ♪ Da, dam, da, dam I saw exactly what Phil was producing. He didn't make a proper demo, someone just threw the music together and he had just written a song. And when Roger, my manager, said, "Tina, this is a song, this is a." He told me it was a big break, so he said, "It's a little bit rough." And I thought, how do I put this together? He wasn't showing me what the melody was. And so I, yeah, I would have to say I created, as close to what I thought the melody was of that. So when I went to actually audition with Phil, he said, "No, no, no, no, just the melody." And he would, with the piano. and then I thought, oh, well, that's easy. You know I can say anything if you tell me how to sing it, give me the melody. [crowd cheering] - Who are you here to see today? - [Crowd] Tina. - That's right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are gonna honor Tina Turner today with star number 1,831 in Hollywood's famous Walk Of Fame. Today we honor Tina Turner for her many, many outstanding achievements in recording.

Congratulations on your day. And thank you very much for being part of our family. [gentle upbeat music] - [Narrator] In December, 2005, Turner was recognized by the Kennedy Center Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. And was elected to join an elite group of entertainers. In December, 2007, Ike Turner passed away. Tina didn't attend the funeral and issued a brief statement through her spokesperson. "Tina hasn't had any contact with Ike in more than 30 years. "No further comment will be made." In 1986 Turner met German music executive Erwin Bach, who was sent by her European record label EMI to greet Turner at Dusseldorf Airport. Bach is over 16 years her junior. He was born on January 24th, 1956 in Cologne, Germany. Initially friends, they began dating later that year. In July, 2013, after a 27 year romantic relationship, they married in a civil ceremony on the banks of Lake Zurich in Kusnacht, Switzerland. [gentle music] - It's 20 years later, I think, probably a little bit more. And a lot has happened since the stage life. And my life changed, I had sicknesses and I moved from America to Switzerland. And retirement set in and things changed. No, actually I had retired, I haven't actually tried to sing since, but I'm sure I can. ♪ Oh yes [gentle upbeat music] - [Narrator] Turner revealed in her 2018 memoir, "My Love Story" that she had suffered life-threatening illnesses. In 2013, three weeks after her wedding to Erwin Bach, she suffered a stroke and had to learn to walk again. - So mild stroke from the back of the head. And then they took me down to the room, I didn't believe it, I said, ah, stroke, ah, ah, like that. They left the room, blop, hit the floor. [gentle music] After we finally got rid of the stroke, then a swindles started, this dizziness. So they found out what that was in the inner ear. We corrected that. And then after that was the kidney thing, they found that, no, that was this one next to the colon. - [Narrator] In 2016, she was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Turner opted for homeopathic remedies to treat her high blood pressure that resulted in damage to her kidneys and eventual kidney failure. Her chances of receiving a kidney were low. And she was urged to start dialysis. She considered assisted suicide and signed up to be a member of Exit. But Bach offered to donate a kidney for her transplant. Turner had kidney transplant surgery on April 7th, 2017. - The Swiss people are like the English, they have manners. [laughing] So I said, well, so what happens? He said, "If you don't maintain, "if you don't do what we recommend, you will probably die." [gentle music] "Only one of your kidneys are functioning." Actually, what happened was, I stopped medication for kidney because I was tired of the medicine and I wanted to see what I felt like my old self, because it has the blood pressure medicine, it restricts you a little bit. And they said to Erwin, "You can live with one kidney." So Erwin thought, no Irvin said to the doctors, "Can I give her one of mine?" Something similar to this, I wasn't there. And then he found out that he doesn't need two kidneys. So then he came to me and said, "Tina, you don't have to make this decision now, "I can give you one of my kidneys." And I said, oh Erwin, you're young, I'm already older, it's okay, just get used to me not being here. And I did feel like I was older, I was already in my 70s, so why should I take the kidneys from a young man and let him finish his life? That's what I felt like. And he said, "No, no, no, my life is fine how it is, "I'll give you one of my kidneys." [gentle music] In Buddhism you accept the life and the death. Yeah, I was ready. I was set, I just thought that it's my time. Anyway, death is not a problem for me, I don't really mind leaving. I know a lot of people don't think that way but I'm happy that I do because it's something that is inevitable so. - [Narrator] Turner announced in December, 2016 that she had been working on "Tina" a musical based on her life story in collaboration with Felita Lloyd and Stage Entertainment. The show opened in London in April, 2018 with Adrian Warren in the lead role. - Everyone is a Tina Turner fan. - And if you're not, we don't believe you. - You're a liar, you're not telling the truth, yeah.
