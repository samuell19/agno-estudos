Ready? Take it from down low, so it looks bigger. - You screwed it up, Reynaldo. - Huh? It's all blurry. Fuck, they've probably already beaten us. I'm worn out, Rey. My back and my bunions hurt, too, but we can't leave without something more than that. Why would your bunions hurt when all we've done is take a damn joyride? It's my fucking gout that won't leave me in peace. Your gout, your back, your prostate. You're a goddamn mess. - Let me help, hand me the rifle. - No, don't. Move over. I'm fine. Don Rey. Wait. Stop. He's at about fifty meters. Eight points? No, like six. I've got him. Did you get him? Let's go. What now? I'm gonna take a leak. Fuck. Rosita, hand me my sunscreen. Thanks. Don Rey. Don Rey, shoot. Rosita, hand me my sunscreen. - Here you go, Rey. - Thanks. Don Rey. Don Rey, shoot! NORTHERN SKIES OVER EMPTY SPACE That's it. One, two... Come on, smile. That's it. We've come to the high point of this celebration, right? Whooo! Of one of the best hunters in Nuevo León, and in Texas, too. And in México and in the whole goddamn world! Speech, Don Reynaldo! What a pleasure. What can I tell you? I'm very grateful... that you're all here. Accompanying me... The Garza Ramírez family. The Garza Garza family. The Garza Martínez family. And everyone who's here at my ranch, where you are always welcome. What? The most precious thing Dad left me. We grew up here. I grew up here from when I was little. Together with my brother Arnulfo who's somewhere around here. Where are you? There's Arnulfo. And we watched our kids grow up here, too. And... Well... In the coming days, we're celebrating the anniversary of the founding of this ranch. Now, twenty years after Dad's passing. He taught me about life on the ranch. He taught me to hunt. And above all, he taught me that family comes first, right? Before everything else. "Except those Garza Ramírez, they're all sissies," he'd say. Cheers! Cheers to everyone! Thank you for coming. Come on, Tello. Tell me the truth. Did you shoot it when I went to take a piss? That's crazy. It was two hundred meters away. He got it. Right, Rey hit it right in the shoulder. That's what they say. When he can't even hit the toilet bowl. Look at that. What's up, Rey? - I hadn't seen you. - I was right behind you. It's great you came, you've really grown. You think? It's the boots. You grew sideways, too... No, I've lost weight, I was a real porker. The heir has arrived. How are you, Uncle? - Wait. - OK. - What's up, Dad? - How are you, son? You missed the award ceremony. I had to put out some fires at work. You're the king of excuses. There you go... Son. What's up, uncle? Congratulations on that hog. That's great. Good. Second place. Next time you gotta bring the kids so they can do the Easter egg hunt. You're bringing your family out for Easter? Yeah, you should come over. After what happened to the Ramos, I come out alone. I don't want my daughters or Lorena to come. I think you're really exaggerating. - You fucker. - Oh, fuck you! What happened? Nothing, he's pissed off because I won the award. Come try the pork. Tell them about the phone call. Some of those thieves called my father-in-law, the ones who call people's cell phones from jail. So those guys called me, the ones who want to extort you. They say, "If you don't give us this much money by tomorrow", we're going to come cut your balls off." And what did you say? I told them, "You better bring a goddamn huge machete." The old guy cuts them down to size! - Cheers! - Cheers, sir. Are you having a good time, Father-in-law? I'm doing great. Hey, what was I going to tell you...? Lalita told me you're really having trouble with the thing about the water. If you want, I can talk to the people at the Department to get them to give us a hand. Thanks, Raulito. It's no problem. You know the only thing I want is what's best for the ranch. And for my wife's family, which is my family. Hey, son. Do you want to inherit my ranch? I mean, yeah, if we're being honest. But I mean no offense. It's just, I've noticed that Elías doesn't seem that interested. And Lily's so out there, you know? What do you mean, "Out there"? Well, I mean, she's so open-minded. What the hell does that mean? I'm just saying this because Laura told me, you know she was with that cholo, and now she's with this boat guy. What do you mean, a boat guy? I mean, he's a surfer, I think. I don't really know. I don't want to give out the wrong idea. Well if you don't know, don't talk. They're fighting. Although the rosebush Doesn't bloom anymore And the love of my life Will never return The kids ask me About their mother When they see their father about to die from crying I'd like to tell you I miss you And scream for you to come back, But nothing's changed here Don't worry about me. Everything's just like When you were here. Come on, man! Truly, everything is still the same. The pictures on the wall are right where you hung them. Your sandals are in their place and your robe is right where you left it. The only thing that's changed is the mirror. Now every time I look it reflects a figure with deep shadows under my eyes and wrinkles that begin to threaten my face. This face you caressed so many times. I'd like to tell you I miss you And scream for you to come back, but nothing's changed here Don't worry about me Everything's just like When you were here Oh, shit! Get your grip right. It's right. That's why it kicks back. I'm left handed, that's how I do it. Gonzalitos! Hey! Dad! Gonzalitos, come! Look at that, you had some real beginner's luck! Where is the damn Gonzalitos? That lazy dog stayed down below. Why that language? Why damn? - Let me see... - I'm fine. OK... What happened? What's Uncle Arnulfo burning over there? Who knows? I didn't even know he was around. I'll go see him later. We've got to take down the blind. How much corn is left? Just these two. Braulio, write that down. We need more. Tell my daughter Lily how much you need, she'll give you the money. Take Tello's truck. Rosa, saddle up Lorenzo. Hey, boss... Have you thought about what we talked about? Yeah, but right now, I can't raise anybody's salary, Tello. Let's talk next hunting season. Hey, Lily said all you guys got was a goose. It's not enough for everybody. Rey... Reynaldo. What? I'm talking to you. I'm looking for the key, have you seen it? I'm sure I had it right here. All you got was a goose? "All we got..." "All we got," she says... Will it feed everybody? What, the goose? No way, I already gave it to Wences. So? What are we going to eat? They always get here all excited about eating a goose, but they don't even like it. Well, that's what you said. If they want goose so bad, they should have gotten up early. Oh right, to hunt? You won't even loan them your rifles. They should get their own. You know Raulito's just a freeloader. You're such an ass. Rey, you're not even a good shot anymore. And in a rage you'd break the egg full of sand on my head. Good morning, Dad. Hi there, princess. This thing broke. The princess's egg broke. Hey, honey, have you seen my keys? They're in the entryway, Dad. But the ones for the storage shed aren't here. Shut up. - Dad. - Good morning, Father-in-law. It's afternoon now. Good morning. How was the hunting? Fine, fine. Help me cut out these papers. No way, honey, you know I'm all thumbs. Well, see, this one over here is making all her eggs satanic. You just love making things hell, right? Don't fill them up with your marijuana. Wouldn't you love that, don't deny it. Hey, do you know what time your brother will be here? He didn't say. No, Dad. - Rey. - What? Did you take your colchicine? Yep. Is he ready? Yes, sir. Should I go with you? No, what for? Hey, don't you have a copy of the key to the storage shed? No? Are you going out? Yep. "Yep, yep, yep." Oh, come on, I'm just going to Arnulfo's. What? Is he here with Lorena and the sourpusses? How should I know. Come on, Sofía. I'm in a hurry. In a hurry for what? The kids are about to get up. I won't be gone long. Fine, bring me some avocados. Avocados? Where from? From town. That's way out of my way. Vicky, wait for the other kids to get up. I told Tello to do cabrito. Where are you going, Dad? Over to Uncle Arnulfo's. Want to take her with you? Hold on tight. That's it. Granddad, it's really hot out here. Look, honey. A hog. You're leaving over a few fucking cows? Oh, screw you. What? "A few fucking cows," he says. Listen to him. This is exactly how it started with the Ramos. And then... remember. Why would what happened to the Ramos happen to you? Look at that. My cows are perfectly fine. I'm not risking everything for this goddamn triangle of dirt. Are you leaving the Sako? No. What about the Winchester? What about it? What do you mean? You have it, don't you? Go on, deny it. Why would I have it? Every five years, it's the same song with you. I traded you the mare for the Winchester. No. That rifle is mine, Reynaldo. You're the one who changes the story every five years. And now you lost it. Seems to me like these cows were sick. You were probably too cheap to give them their shots. The Ramos were up to no good. That's not true, Reynaldo. And you know it's not. Honey. Are you coming by later or what? I'm going to Monterrey to have lunch with Lorena and the girls. But it's the anniversary of the ranch, damn it. I have to finish packing. Do whatever you want. Let's go, honey. Let's get you on the horse. Granddad, I don't like avocado. What do you mean you don't like avocado? - Take care, boss. - Thanks. Avocado is really good. Let's go. Your grandmother wants guacamole. Wait for me, Adrián. Wait for me, Adrián! He killed the little goat. Why are you crying? I'm going to have nightmares. Oh, shut up. Be a man, son. Don't cry. It's them or us. Isis, help me set the table, goddamn slacker. But Mama! How was it, honey? Did you ride the horse, princess? - Take it. - For the guacamole, right? What happened to the boy? - Don't make a scene, please. - No. - Hi, Dad. - Look, kids! - Hi, son. - Your uncle Elías is here. He brought a clown! How cute. Adorable. You screwed it up, Elías. We agreed we'd bring the Easter Bunny and you'd bring the bouncy castle. I brought the bouncy castle too, idiot. What did you think? Are you going to help us or are you afraid to ruin your manicure? I'm busy making the presentation for the ranch, OK? Hey, have you shown mom your new tattoo? When did you get a tattoo, you little wretch? It's tiny, Mom. Like four months ago or so. So you want to be a cow? You already have that thing in your nose. And now you're branded. It's tiny, look. - It's awful. - It's... If your father sees that he'll have a heart attack. It's really nice. I'm going to tell him tonight. Whenever Dad gets to the ranch, he starts talking like Granddad, super rude. Nobody but Rosa can stand him. Tell me if he keeps talking to you like that. Crazy old man. It's fine, that's how I talk to him too. That's how we get along. Well, you really better improve your manners. Because no matter what you're coming with us to Monterrey. There you'll have him all over you, all day long. You're taking Rosa to town? Yeah. Licha left, I told you that, right? Licha? Wasn't it Carmen? No, Licha. Licha from San Luis Potosí. Don't you remember, the one that was all like... who organized everything like... - Yeah. - That one. You run them all off, Mom. Oh, don't exaggerate. Do you have a boyfriend, Rosa? With that face she'll wind up getting married on you in Monterrey. I can't imagine Rosa putting up with Dad at the house. Especially with how he's been lately, and he's worse with Elías. You should see him. He's really awful. Mom, Lily and I met Elías's friend. No, no. - It's OK, it's fine. - No. - What is it? - Just clean. What's wrong, Mama? What's going on? Nothing, nothing. What's wrong? Let me... It's this menopause, honey. I forget it's happening. You're going through menopause, but at least you're not sweating like a pig, look. - Smell it. - Stop! Hey, where should I put the bouncy castle? Where should I set it up? I think you should set up over there. Over here there's too much sun. And where can I plug everything in, the cables and all? - What do you need? - I mean, everything. I just need you to tell me where and I'll set up so the party can start. Tello. Tello! Bring the clown some extension cords. Go on. Thanks, man. Where are the kids? They're with Claudia. I told you to bring them. I haven't seen them since your birthday. Those kids will forget who I am. I know, Dad. But she wouldn't let me. How's the negotiation going? It's going. Seems like we're going to sign papers soon. Eugenio said you never called him. I wound up getting advice from a friend I didn't want to bother him. What did they advise you? Not to get custody or what? What about you? Have you got a girlfriend? No. How about her? Is she moving in with the other guy? Yeah, I think they're getting married. What does he do? I think he's a lawyer. Right, he's never gonna let you have custody of the kids. Hey. I can't find your grandfather's rifle. Have you seen it? No. Tello! Throw lime on it! Rosa! Your turn. Your turn. Your turn... Your turn. Dad... planted this tree... when I was still a little tyke... around Vicky's age. Go on, son, tell us the history of the ranch. OK. Here goes. Grandfather Reynaldo had arrived from Spain... No, no, no. It was your great grandfather Arnulfo who came from Spain. Grandfather Reynaldo was born here in Monterrey. - Let me finish. - Tell things the right way. If you're going to tell it, tell it right. Grandfather Reynaldo had inherited some land in Arteaga. - What is it? - Nothing. And there in Arteaga, he met grandmother Cordelia. She was a teacher at this school. Why are you saying that? What's the point? Rey, let him finish. I mean, just tell the part about the cougar. Fine, you tell it, Dad. Or you guys, you goddamn idiots. If you'll allow me, Dad, I'll... Go on, Rosa, tell these fools the history of the ranch, let's see if they learn it. I don't know it. You too! But I've told it a hundred times. So Grandfather was looking for land around here and one day, he came across a cougar. He took out his Winchester and killed it. And he decided to build the house right there, the whole ranch. - Like it's that easy! - Isn't that it? - That's the story, Dad. - Yeah, just that easy. The end. Dad was looking... for land. Someone told him that around here there was a spring. So he wanted to see it. Ever since I was little, he took me everywhere. So, I went with him. I remember it crystal clear. We were really tired and sunburned. Suddenly, we saw some branches moving. We thought it was a rabbit, and then we realized it was a cougar. Since Dad wasn't a hunter, he was just a peasant then he thought it might attack us. Somehow he pushed me away with one hand and he raised the Winchester with the other, and... Boom! He fired at it. The animal panicked, it took off running, It was wounded so it left a trail. Dad told me, "Come on!" Let's follow it." So we went. Around here, it was full of huizache and prickly pear. We got to a point where we couldn't pass through. Dad said, "Wait here." And he went in, almost crawling on the ground, following the cougar's trail. Since the animal was hurt, it couldn't sense him. Then it pounced, it lunged at him like it wanted to give him a hug. Really. And as God helped him, he raised his rifle again and boom! He fired another shot. I'm sure it was right there, defending himself, that he developed a taste for the shakes that come on when you take an animal's life. These events were so significant that my dad decided to spend everything he had right here on this land. And right here, where he buried the cougar, he planted this orange tree. My dear father made death into life. Hi! Is the Bunny here yet? No, the road from Pozos is really rough. It's pretty confusing. Hey, Dad, what was I going to say? You know, I have this friend who's an agricultural engineer. - Did Lalita tell you? - No. The guy's a big shot, he graduated from TEC. He's fantastic with citrus and sorghums. - Dad! - Yeah. I want to show you my presentation. - Then show me. - I don't want to see it. - Tell me when. - After the meal. It's not enough, because it's really far out here. You should have been prepared for that, otherwise, I'll hire some other clown for the next time. I do a professional show. A good party... - The pork isn't ready. - For the evening? The girl! What happened? What did you do? - Elías! - Come with me, honey. What happened to the bouncy castle, man? I don't know, I don't know. The little girl must have done something. What could a little girl do to it? "The realm of the dead is naked before God." Destruction lies uncovered. He spreads out the northern skies over empty space. He suspends the earth over nothing. He wraps up the waters in his clouds, "yet the clouds do not burst under their weight." Job 26:6-8. That's all, son. Now your blessing, honey. Thank you, Lord, for my family, my friends and the Avengers. The Avengers... In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Hey, what happened to the fucking castle? Why did it deflate? There you go cursing again! I think the electricity went out. Did you tell Tello to go check the transformer? I haven't told anyone to do anything. Tello, go check the transformer. I'll go! Rosa. Rosa! She doesn't listen to anyone! - Hey, leave her alone. - Fine, it's time to eat. It's already four in the afternoon. "It's four in the afternoon." It's a moment for reflection. What use is it for a man to control "the whole world, if he loses himself?" "Radio Recuerdo." And some tortillas... Thanks, man. What about them? Who's that, Rey? It's really hot out here, huh? We better go inside. No, we're great out here. No, come on in. Bring the kids! Elías. Come here, Elías. Get inside, son. Elías! Go inside. Go on! Who would think that one Day you would abandon me Who would think that one Day I would cry for you... Cry, cry, cry Cry, cry, cry, cry How are you? Don Reynaldo, right? What's up. Ricardo Guzmán. You know, in town everything is closed, so we wanted to see if you'd share a taco with us. Hey, Tello. Pack up some kidney for these guys. No, not kidney. Give us some shoulder, man. Who the hell are you guys? We're just here watching over the area. Haven't you seen how dangerous it's gotten? I'm sure they've told you. Can't we eat here? No, my friend. This is a family occasion. What if I call you Dad? No, just joking, nothing but respect, man. Speaking of respect... Aren't you going to want to hire security? We're going around, keeping watch over other ranches. We'll come back to see if you change your mind, right? Look, friend. You better not come back here. I already answered. Alright then, got it. Hey dog, did you give us tortillas? We're off, don't want this to get cold. Alright, my friend. Enjoy the food. See you soon! They're leaving. What was all that, Dad? Don't worry, honey. Sit down, go on. - Rey! - Come here. Who were they? - What did they say? - Nothing. Just sit. - Come on, tell me. - Calm down, it's nothing. I think we should eat and then leave, right? Let's get out of here. No way... Everybody sit down, calm down. They were just some freeloader friends who wanted some tacos, that's it. So you know them? Yep. Sit down, Elías. Don't lie, Rey. Let's get out of here. The kids are tired. I said no. It's early, let's eat. - Sit down, Raúl. - Sit down, honey. Go on. Vicky, want to sit here? Come here with your granddad. Want some guacamole? Help yourselves, help yourselves. Oh, jeez! Those jerks took the shoulder! We have to warm up the tortillas, again. Where's Rosa? Calm down, it's over. There's nothing wrong. Calm down. There's a hunter in the woods, and after he shoots a hog he realizes he doesn't have any bullets left. So the hunter says: "Without bullets, how can I get back home?" To his cabin. There he goes, scared out of his mind, hoping no animal comes after him. After he walks a little ways, out comes a cougar. The hunter wasn't a believer, but he said: "I'll pray to God, it's my only hope." He looks to the sky and prays: "Lord, don't let this cougar eat me get it out of my path." There's no more gasoline? No, we're out. Why didn't you tell me? There's more in the storage shed. Tomorrow I will fix the fuses. And the cougar leaves without doing anything to him. Hey... what the fuck is going on with Braulio? Is he in with a bad crowd? Make a bonfire. So the hunter keeps on his way. And suddenly, a huge bear appears. A ferocious bear. So the hunter prays to God again, and speaks and says: "Lord, have mercy, please don't let this bear eat me." And so, the bear kneels. This huge bear! This has to be a joke. The bear kneels. - What do you think it does? - What? It starts to pray. The bear takes out his rosary. It starts to pray. So... the hunter congratulates God. - No, wait. - Look into my eyes. What happened to the cow? It died. What was wrong with it? What does the boss know about you that has him all suspicious? Me? Nothing. What would he know? He's all bitter, he doesn't trust this idiot's stupid face. I mean... So, he tells the Lord, he says: "Thank you, God, for being so good to me." But then, suddenly, he hears the bear, who says as he kneels: "Thank you, God, for blessing this food we are about to eat." Did you get it? The bear's going to eat him. He's having him for dinner. - What's wrong? - I don't know. What's wrong? What's wrong, son? What's wrong, son? What's wrong? Tell me. Is someone out there? Tello! Tello! Rosa! Rosa! Bring shovels! Help! Where's Elías? Throw dirt on it! No, Dad, don't! You have to throw dirt on it! You have to pay them, Reynaldo. It's not that simple, Mom. They ask you once, then again and again. And it's the fucking never-ending story. We have to do this right. Gregorio has a buddy at the Marines. Gregorio? I mean, I thought he could help. You're going to have to pay, Don Reynaldo. There's no other choice. Thanks, Rosa. But this is a family issue. Maybe it's best to think about selling the ranch. Rey, let's go. At least, to the police. My uncle has a... Here, the thing is bringing in the water. We'd have to lay the pipes and then sell. No, no, no. I'm not at all... sold on putting in those pipes. Can you come here? They don't want to go to sleep and I'm all frustrated. Hold on, Lalita. We're figuring out what we're going to do. Raúl. Can you please come here? I'll be back. Hang in there, family. It's going to be alright. You'll see. Thanks, son. How much do they want? It's probably not a lot. So? We're leaving. But I'm not going to pay them a cent. That's it. Everybody find their place. Let's go. Let's go, Vicky. Be careful, Lalita. - I love you, Daddy. - Thank you for coming. We're here, whatever you need. You just let me know. Bye, Granddad! I love you! Elías! Take your mother with you, and Lily and Rosa, too. - And you? - Fine. I'm not going anywhere without you. Jeez... Plus, we don't fit in that tiny fucking car. I'll go in my SUV, you go in yours and we'll all follow each other. I'll catch up with you this afternoon. Go. Tello! It's a fine hour to get started. Where's Rosa? Tell her to come, they're leaving. I'll leave with you, later. We're leaving, but we're not going to make it easy on them. For sure. Want me to check about the Marines? Fine. I love you, Dad. Tello! Isn't this your home? Yep. "Yep, yep, yep." Is yep all you know how to say? Look. We're going to reinforce all the wire fencing. And we're going to dig a trench along the Camino Real road. I think that was where those fuckers got in. Here, at the house, we're going to board up all the doors and all the windows. OK, Don Rey. - Hey, sir. - Yep. You're going to board up our house too, right? Yep. I don't have anywhere to go. You're going to take Rosa, right? Yep. She's pregnant. Why didn't you guys go with Elías? I don't know. It's going to get ugly if your dad doesn't pay. Remember when you used to call him Dad too? I was really little, I was just messing around. There's water here. You can tell just like that? Just like that. You don't have to put in those pipes you want to install. What's the point of all that now, right? It's going to get ugly and who knows what else. It's been ugly for a while now. But it's going to get worse, for sure. You complete me, You're my half orange I love you without Saying a word If this isn't a dream You're my other half I love you without saying A word If this isn't a dream... - Cut it out. - You're my other half You and Tello are a thing, right? And you and the sailor, too? Oh, screw you! He's not a sailor. He's a surfer. I want to move in with him, but I haven't told my parents. Why the fuck do you have to tell them, you're old now. What about skating? What? Y'all have no idea what it's like to live here, you know? You pretend like you do but... You come here, you dress up all country, you waste your bullets... Then you get in your trucks and go home blasting the air conditioning, right? Let's go see how those lazy bums are doing with the ditches. They say digging is really good for pregnant women, right Tello? Where the fuck is Braulio? He'll be here soon. Rosa, go change the herd's water, go on. Won't be my fault. Liliana, if I tell you to stay will that make you leave? Take your mother to Monterrey, you're just in the way here. Tello! Tello! Stop! Come on! Get in the truck, quick! What's wrong? Stay in the kitchen. Rey! Nothing. Get in the kitchen! Don't shoot, Don Reynaldo! Tello, grab the shotgun and go out back. I'm ready, Dad. Don't shoot, Liliana. I'm a better shot than you, Dad. Fix your grip. I told you I'm left handed, fuck off. Steady, honey, steady. Oh my god. Oh my god. - What the fuck? - What the hell? Hi. I'm the Easter Bunny. I came for the party they hired me for, but I got lost, sorry. Honey, the party was yesterday! Isn't today the 15th? Yesterday was the 15th. Oh, my bad. Sorry. I got really lost. So much stress for nothing. It's OK? Early tomorrow, you're taking your mother. I'm staying one more day. What for? There's still a lot of work to do here, honey. You stay calm. Y'all almost shot the Easter Bunny. You really think I would have shot her, - once I realized who it was? - Well, Lily. Lily almost shot the Easter Bunny. The ranch is just mesquite trees and dust. That's it. I hate to see how you treat Elías. He loves you so much. I love him, too. Why don't you show him? This land was here, before your dad supposedly shot the cougar and planted that orange tree. Don't say supposedly, Sofía. It was already here, Rey. And it will be here afterwards. - Excuse me. - Sorry, pardon me. Good morning. It's afternoon. Did the Bunny leave? She said she was late for another event. Your coffee. How's it going? It's coming along. Tello. Tell Braulio he can tell his friends that I'm going to pay them. I've decided. They live around here, in Lucio Blanco. We all know each other here, but they're not my friends. Are they armed? I mean, like everybody else here. They're guys who grow the wrong way, boss. Listen, Braulio. I've given you a job since you were really little. I swear they're not my friends. "I swear." You send them word that I'm going to pay. There's water in Lomitas. For real. Rosa found it with her stick. No, that can't be. It's true. We just have to put in a windmill. We'll talk about it later, honey. OK. Take good care of yourself, for me. Yep. Tello, leave that there and drive with them to the highway. Rosa, hurry, you're leaving too. Rosa isn't leaving. Fine. Then, you're going to follow my orders like the rest of these guys. What's wrong? The menopause. - I'll see you soon. - Yep. - Go on now. - Yep. Come for your shoulder, asshole. Rosa! Tonight you're on guard duty. Help me! Calling Boots. Calling Boots. Orange Tree, here from the peak, do you copy? Go for Boots. Guzmán. No names, comrade. OK. He's ready. He's going to pay. Alright. We'll come around to pay a visit. OK, then. This is done. Take some, son. Take some. Want some, Tello? No, thanks. Better for us, right, Braulio? We'll get more. No, I'm OK, boss. I was really hungry, but I don't like it either, the meat is really chewy. I thought this was your thing. Thank you. Which one of these guys told you? I'm not going to have it. You don't have to say that, Rosa. It was you who told him, right? You fucking tattle-tale, Tello. Then tell him all of it. I had to tell someone. How many months along are you? I guess... About two? No way. Tell him, Tello. The thing is, it's not Tello's. There were a bunch of guys who broke into the ranch. Who knows which one was the father. Fucking Tello. You never told me. Hold out your hand. What? Just hold out your hand. Where was this little son of a bitch? Where are you going? There it is. What's wrong? Did you know about this, too? Get up, asshole. Get up, motherfucker. Don Rey, leave him alone. Come here. Grab him, Wences. Why, boss? Tello, go on! What's wrong? Be a man. Leave him alone, Don Rey, calm down. Let's go. Hey, Don Rey! Take it easy! Be still! - You've got it all wrong, boss. - Shut up! Let him go. Tello, tell him to let him go. Let him go, Don Reynaldo. For fuck's sake... What if I don't? Traitors. Tello, let them in. The boss is coming, I think he went to get the money. Alright. What's wrong, Rosa. Why so serious, what's up? Smile a little, sweetheart. Fine then. Let me know how you want me to send you your share. If you want cash, a wire transfer, PayPal or I'll pay you in booze, babe, whatever you want. The boss is going to pay you. Keep what you owe us, but leave us alone. Félix! Félix! Don Rey. Rosita. Hand me my sunscreen! Rosita! - Hand me my sunscreen! - Don Rey. Did you get him? Don Rey. Shoot it, Don Rey. Don Rey. Did you get him? Rosita? All you had to do was pay a few pesos. That was the deal. Now the others are coming. And there's no excuse good enough for them. Who are the others? The really bad guys. Let's go. Let's go to Monterrey. Grab your stuff and we'll go right now. They're already watching the roads. There's no way to get out. Look, I'm going to give you money, so you can go somewhere else when all this is over. Except for you, asshole. You're leaving without one cent. You know what, I'm going to shut you in the little house. I don't trust you. What do we do with Guzmán? - Who? - The bad guy. The dead guy. Well... We have to bury him, we're not animals, right? No. That's for his family to do. Enough, man. We'll just pile some rocks on him. That's enough. I was the one who took the Winchester. I set the orange tree on fire. Quit punishing Braulio. It was me who made the deal with them. Did you tell anyone? About the deer. No. Do you swear? I swear it to you. That's fine, I don't really care. To me, you shot it. My brother thinks it was Tello. Yeah, right! It's yours. The Winchester, my gift to you. Oh, that goddamn Wenceslao. Want me to shoot his tire? No. Let him go. Rosa, are you awake? Yep. If we take the Camino Real we'll get to the Galindo ranch, they could help us out. Let's go, you and me. The old man has a death wish. What about Braulio? That Braulio is like the pigs. He's full of tricks. Don't look back, you'll get dizzy. Hey. Take my truck and get out of here. - But... - No questions. Now! Screw you, motherfucker! Hello? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Easter Bunny. The famous Bunny. Yeah, you left it here. It's just that it's really strange that the call came through, there's no reception. Sure, don't worry about it. I'll bring it to you, when I go to Monterrey. We'll figure out how to meet up. Yeah. Hey. Can I ask you for a favor? Look up my son Elías and tell him that I love him very much. Yeah, just that. OK, take care. Like when you were there Yes It is true that There is no heat Not even in the house And the smell Of your body without equal Already The fountain has dried up The canary already died But there is nothing new here Nope Do not worry about me Here everything remains the same Like when you were here It is true that the rosebush No longer bears flowers Nor the love of my life Never have to come back The children ask me About their mother When they see that their father Is already dead... Let me in! What are you doing here, girl? Get down, honey. The window! Are you alright? Do you have more ammo? I think I've got one shot left. See? You should have gone to Monterrey. Yeah, you're right. Yep. You're a really good shooter, kiddo. Yeah, you're right. THE END I saw you arrive I approached your life And you let you love And now you're leaving I gave you my love You made me happy, You did me a favor And now you leave me With the pain Who would think that one Day you would abandon me Who? Who? Who would think that one Day I would cry for you... Cry, cry Cry Cry I gave you my love You made me happy, You did me a favor And now you leave me With the pain You let yourself be loved And I thank you Instead of scolding Even if today I'm flooded with tears Who would think that one Day you would abandon me Who? Who? Who would think that one Day I would cry for you... Cry, cry Cry Cry Cry Cry Cry
