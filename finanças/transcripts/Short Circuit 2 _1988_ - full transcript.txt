[SIRENS WAILING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] MAN 1 : Rolex watches. You know the name, now own the watch. Oh, you little rascal, running away like that. Are you all seeing how he is running around? He is programmed to be doing that. This is a highly sophisticated robot for $19.95. No tax, please note. Hey, uncle, are you wanting to buy? Uncle, there's no obligation. Rolex. Rolex watch. You know the name, now own the watch. MAN 2: How much is that? The ultimate in Swiss craftsmanship. No doubt you've seen these on sale at Tiffany's for $1700. I deal in volume. My special price to you today, 39.95. 39.95. How are you gonna beat that? You gonna beat that? How are you gonna beat that? Would you like a robot? How's your line moving, pal? They're not selling like pancakes, that is for certain. Maybe I should be selling them door-to-door, huh? [LAUGHS] Door-to-door? In this town? Did you just fall off the banana boat or what? I do not travel with bananas, sir. And I'll have you know I've been kicking around town for two days' time already. Really? Interested in upgrading your image? Up my image? FRED: I'm gonna let you have half of my inventory, huh? What would you say to that? [♪♪♪] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] WOMAN 1 : Ooh! What the--? [WOMAN 2 GASPS] [WOMAN 3 YELPS] WOMAN: Wha--? MAN: Why, hey. Oop. [BEEPS] WOMAN: Oh, look at that. [LITTLE RICHARD'S "TUTTI FRUTTl" PLAYING ON RADIO] Wait, Mr. Slater, lock, look. You haven't seen this. You haven't seen this before. Check it out. Look, see? They're hands. They clap. I know it'll sell. Sandy, we don't sell novelty items. Now how many chances am I supposed to give you? I told you I want high tech and I want it now. For Christmas, not Easter, got it? Yes, sir, high tech. I'll can the hat and I'll keep looking. And if you don't mind, Miss Banatoni, some of us are trying to work. [TURNS RADIO OFF] Ah. That's better. Silence is better than Little Richard? [BEEPS] I can let you have these, rock bottom, wholesale. You're gonna clean up. That is nice of you, but I'm occupying myself-- The toy robot business, that's pathetic. They're not gonna move. Not in this town. Excuse me, is this yours? Yes. It is called Number Five. It rolled right past my office. Listen-- FRED: Excuse me. My friend and I were taking a meeting. Who are you? Sandy Banatoni, assistant buyer, Simpsons Toy Department, okay? Listen, these are great toys. Thank you. I showed this to my boss, he loves it. Where did you get them? Oh, I am making them. I am Ben Jahrvi. Titanic Toy Corporation. Like the ship? I'm sorry I haven't heard of you. Where are you located? Well, actually, I am based in that vehicle right over yonder. No, I mean, where is your assembly plant, your offices? Well, you're also there. It is also my home. You mean you make these yourself? In there? Yeah. Yes, you see, robotics is the only livelihood I am knowing. Are you wanting to purchase one? See the hands? They bendy like that. We deal in volume. I couldn't possibly order less than a thousand. One thousand? A thousand. A thousand? We could do a thousand. No perspiration, if the per-unit price is at all attractive. Who are the "we"? We could go maybe 50 a piece? Oh, no, I'm only charging $19.95. A day, to rent. If you wanna buy them wholesale, 50. We could live with 50 a piece. Okay. Maybe, but seriously, how long before you could deliver? Oh, well, you just want a rough estimate of how long? Yes, yes, 1000 robots? This is a ballpark figure, you know? We round it off... [CALCULATOR BEEPING] They could be ready for delivery middle of October. Really? 1993. Rolex. Get a Rolex watch. Look, I'm sorry for wasting your time. We're in two different worlds here. I mean, I'd have to have them in, like, 30 days. Thirty days? I'm sorry. Oh, wait a minute. You know, he meant with our current facilities. But we could expand our operation, you know? We can get more personnel, a larger factory. Once we get your cash advance, we could be in high gear. Again you say this "we" part, sir. My boss would never go for cash advance. For Simpsons, we'll forego the advance. Tell you what. How does this sound? We'll show up at your door October 15th this year with 1000 of these fine robots. You guarantee to buy them $50 apiece, COD, huh? Huh? Okay. Yeah, okay. Get your lawyers on the paperwork. We got a deal. We got a deal. Thank you, thanks very much. We are making a deal. Well, this is most pleasantly pleasing. I am studying with fervor to become a citizen of your country 'tis of thee. You are appreciating my robots, huh? Yeah. Did you ask me a question? Benny, merchandise is running away. Get back here, you're grounded. Bye, now. I'm going to take your batteries out. Bad boys. FRED: First things first. Before the first thing is a question. Who are you and what is your good name, sir? Fred Ritter. I'm in the entrepreneur business. I ask financial questions like "Where's your capital?" Washington, D.C. All right. Simple words. How are you gonna build those robots yourself with no money? I am thinking I will contact my friends Newton and Stephanie in Montana. Perhaps they can assist me financially. Montana? You got friends here. I just got you your big break. Tell me what you need. [♪♪♪] [SIRENS APPROACHING] Oscar, step aside. POLICEMAN: Stay back, ladies. Back, there. REPORTER: Mr. De Ruyter, may we have a word? Mr. De Ruyter, welcome to the U.S. and welcome to First Federal Trust. It's a great honor for all of us at the bank and I'd like-- Might we step inside, please? Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. [♪♪♪] Madson steel alloy, A450. Of course. Built by Heimdall, completely custom. I must say, we're really quite, quite proud of it. Mm-hm. Gentlemen, the Vanderveer Collection. We'll keep them here until one day before the exhibition is to open at the museum. Of course, during the day we'll have a special detail of six armed guards. And at night, they'll be augmented by 12 strategically-placed security personnel. DE RUYTER: Excellent. DARTMOOR: Glad you approve. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] You already owe me a substantial sum, Fred. Comes due in 30 days. Yes, Mr. Arnold, I'm aware. But it takes money to make money. And this is a sure thing. With this, I am guaranteed in the black. And you. Your money, your interest is in your pocket in full, on time. No bullshit. And this time, I have great collateral. Fifty-five Rolex watches. You know the name, now own the watch. I know the name, Fred. And your body is your collateral. [CHUCKLING] Oh. Now, this does not change our original contract. Absolutely not. Still owe me everything. Absolutely. In 30 days. Thirty days. FRED: This is it, your new factory rented just for you. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Right here? You see? This is why I'm studying to become citizen of your great country. In one day's time only, a man can go from a mean street corner like this one to a tall skyscraping building like that one. What are you talking about? Not the bank. One-eighty, over here. Huh? Midtown, centrally located, been here since 1902. Beautiful, huh? And a historic building. Come on. Huh? It's unbelievable, isn't it? They're gonna tear it down in a couple of months. Sweet-talked them into a short-term lease. Really? Got it for a song. It will work, though, right? It's got everything we need. It's got walls and windows. Phone service. All the square footage you could ask for. Hi. FRED: Benny, I'd like you to meet your production staff. They're fast learners, they're hard workers, and, hey, minimum wage. Now here's your budget for tools and parts and all that. I promised our staff a three-course dinner. Got my favorite table reserved at McDonald's. Excuse me? How are you obtaining this financial funding? A little muscle, a whole lot of hustle. Everybody get a watch? WOMAN: Yeah, I got a watch. Come on, you like McNuggets? BEN: Who is he? FRED: Trust me. [♪♪♪] JONES: I don't believe it. SAUNDERS: Well, this is just great. Just great. Who the hell are they? Nobody's supposed to be here. Slow down, Saunders. God, I knew I should've stayed away from this. So leave. Go back to your two-bit computer scam. You were doing so good, huh? Huh? All right. Now how much time do we need? Ha! You gotta be kidding. We're not even past utility lines yet. The soil density is much lower than I figured. We're gonna have to start shoring every five feet. There's no way we'll ever get to those jewels before-- How much time? [COMPUTER BEEPING] If we have to stop digging for more than five days, we'll never make it in time. We gotta get them out of here or we can kiss those diamonds goodbye. Hey, Benny, where did you get the idea for this thing? Oh, no, no. Split conductor cable, remember? Mm-hm. Before I arrived in the city, I was working in Oregon for Nova Robotics. Together with my friend, Newton, we designed and we built the real Number Five robot. Unfortunately, the military got hold of him and decided to use him as a weapon of death and destruction. You mean you were making these things for real and now you make toys for a living? Gee. Well, the real Number Five, he malfunctioned and... Well, let us just say that we were separated from our jobs. Well, when you have completed this robot, we will have 25. FRED: Voila, my man. Number 25. Twenty-four. [♪♪♪] Excuse me, sir, but we are not open to the public. Oh, hello. Can I--? [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hey, come on now, guys. You're jumping the gun here. Arnold said I got 29 more days. Hey, watch the silk. JONES: Come on, let's do it. Oh, no, sir, please, don't touch-- No, please, don't leave. Don't forget the circuit-- Tester. BEN: Not the circuit tester. Oh! Oh, now, Fred, get up, you chicken. You have to learn to defend yourself. But who would be doing this to struggling business persons like ourselves? I thought it was somebody I knew. No, wait, sir, wait. Oh, now, now we are unemployers. Oh, look. We still got all of the robot parts in the van. I can get a new staff together. We are having no more money and now having no equipment. To assemble the robots with our naked hands, it would be slower than mole's asses in January. Benny, you leave me with my back to the wall here. We gotta come up with something. It's not possible. We are people who have everything in our favor going against us. Look, look, how about this. How about we go to the lady at Simpsons and we beg for an advance? I mean, we go in there and we grovel. We look really pathetic. [KNOCKING] MAN: Mountain Lion Air Freight. We got a delivery for you. Oh, yeah? We've had enough deliveries for one day, pal. MAN: Mr. Benjamin Jarvee, right? Jahrvi. MAN: Yeah, we should leave it out here or what? Yeah, leave it out there. [TRUCK STARTS AND DRIVES OFF] Yeah, it is for you. Who knows you're here? I have only told my friends in Montana. [♪♪♪] I've never seen that happen before. What the hell is this crap? Who is caring? This crap is moving. Hello, bozos. Benjamin. Oh, come here, give me a hug. Oh, it's so good to see you. Number Five. For you from Stephanie. All-natural granola brownies. No preservatives or additives. That's the real one. That's the real Number Two. Number Five. Number Five. Please, call me Johnny Five. Johnny? You've taken name for yourself? I choose many things for myself, but did not choose traveling in a box. I choose to fly tourist class, but they say I'm cargo. No movie, no magazine, no bag of peanuts. Yeah, but what are you doing here? I am not understanding. JOHNNY: Oh, listen. Ahem. [IN STEPHANIE'S VOICE] Dear Ben, we decided that the only way we could help was to send Number Five. He can build your toy robot. But you know how crazy he is for input so please keep an eye on him. Good luck. Love, Stephanie and Newton. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh, Benjamin, this is your home? Domicile? Flophouse? Oh, Fred. Lady luck's here sitting in our laps today. She is, huh? You said this thing misfunctioned on you. Oh, that is a falsity. What happened was we were working on him one day. Suddenly, he was struck by lightning. From this moment on, he's having a mind of his own. So the government tried to destroy him so he ran away. So now, he's living with my friend in Montana, in a cabin, in the woods, incognito. Ooh! Input. Hound of the Baskervilles. [MUTTERING] I think the chauffeur did it. He did. Hey, listen very carefully. I am thinking we should not tell him he is in major metropolitan area. If he is discovering he's in whole city full of input, he will go insanely crazy. You mean this thing just runs by itself? JOHNNY: Thing? An object without life? A personal possession? Incorrect. Johnny Five not a thing. Yeah, right. What I mean is, is it remote-controlled or what? Well... You would not believe me, huh? Number Five? Hm? Johnny Five. Johnny is a very cute name, huh? I like it. Come here. Come on. This is my friend, Fred. Oh, hello, Fred. No, over here, yeah. Oh, right, sorry. Perhaps Fred would like a little demonstration of how you will be helping us out of this sticky predicament we are now stuck inside of. Here, please assemble. JOHNNY: Sure. Okay, check diagram, and keep fine tread assembly dry. Okay and... [JOHNNY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Insert Tab B into Slot B. Whoa. Don't forget the nernies. This one's here. Let's get part of that fused in. [GASPS] It's me. Isn't that special? We're home free. It can build them all, right? Mm-hm. [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] MAN 1 [ON TV]: What is it, Matumwa?

JOHNNY: Benjamin. Bwana Benjamin. Wake-up call. [TARZAN YELLING ON RECORDING] [BEN YAWNING] JOHNNY: Up and at them, Benjamin. Time for recharging. BEN: Good morning. Morning. You have an alternative power supply, huh? Lithium-argon liquid battery, good for 500 hours. Improvement on your design. Cut the bugs out. Yes, and I am proud of you. You removed your laser weapon, huh? Weapon is to kill, disassemble, make dead. Unacceptable. You have made many modifications upon your person, huh? You have come a long way from the Defense Department prototype. You betcha. It's the all-new Johnny Five. Just look at these items. Increased memory, 500 megabytes online. I come with a utility pack, dozen gadgets for outdoor living, Greenpeace stickers, even my own Nike swoosh.

No, Johnny Five, you-- You must wait here, huh? It's-- You stay here and-- There is nothing outside. It is very boring out there. Everything you need is here, huh? I'll be back soon. It is very boring out there. No input, huh. Boring, boring, boring. Dubious. Hard to believe. Excuse me. Oh. Oh, hi. Mr. Jahrvi, right? Jahrvi, but you can call me B-E-N. I spell it Ben. Ben, hi. So how's it going? Oh, great. Oh. Yeah? This for you. Oh. Ben, it looks great. Thank you. Hey, this looks even better than your prototype. So you can actually mass-produce with this quality and still meet our deadline? Yes. Great, great. So why don't you go down and see my secretary about signing the papers? I don't know why. No, I mean, you should go. Oh, I mean yes. Yeah, okay, good. Yes. Well, so good luck with the rest of them and be in touch. Oh. Uh...

Philosophy, art, religion, aerobics. But, Frederick, there's so many more. I could do the whole store in 35 minutes. Give me a break. I got you some input, didn't I? Now do something for me. Okay. And watch the shirt. Silk. Yeah, damn right. From the Bombyx mori moth caterpillar, or silkworm. I don't care. Come on, we'll gonna be late. [♪♪♪] This is far too risky. I mean, broad daylight. JONES: All three of them are gone. It's the only chance we'll get. We'll be out of here in under two minutes. I used to do this for a living. It'll be a controlled fire. [BOTH SCREAMING] [JOHN PHILIP SOUSA'S "THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER" PLAYING] JOHNNY [ON RECORDING]: Ladies and gentlemen. Direct your attention to the person or persons attempting illegal entry here at 135 West Lafayette Boulevard. They are criminals, thugs, bad dudes, desperados. So get the police, the Lone Ranger, Dirty Harry, Mean Joe Greene, the Green Berets, the Green Hornet. Woo-hoo! No, it can't be. The Nova project was scrapped and the robots were destroyed. I'm telling you. It's a Nova robot. JOHNNY: Follow the red card. Winners all the time. Everybody's a winner. Follow the red card, red or black. Follow the red card, not the black card. Everybody step right up, take a chance. No, it's just that me and Ben Jahrvi, he's my partner. We've got-- Ben Jahrvi? Yeah. Ben Jahrvi. Wasn't he with Nova Robotics? He was Newton Crosby's partner. MAN: Whatever happened to those guys? They were supposed to be such hotshot engineers. WOMAN: Incredible adaptability. It's a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. Hi. Very impressive, Mr... Ritter, Fred Ritter, nice to meet you. Ritter, huh? You say it's not remote control but how else can you get such a range of abilities? Corporate secrets, which I will, of course, explain in detail once we have a sale. That is, if you're interested. Well, yes, of course we are interested. Sale, contract by which ownership of property is transferred. What property is for sale? [ALL LAUGH] Well, you, I hope. Fred wants to sell me? Come on, it's just a figure of speech. Am not property, Frederick. One whose person is under control of another as master is a slave. That's all we need. A robot who's into equal rights. Five, if you blow this, I'll pull your head off. I swear to God I will. But they cannot purchase me, cannot, I am alive. I'm endowed by my creator with certain inalienable rights-- [SCREAMING] [♪♪♪] Falling 32 feet per second. Unacceptable. Better hurry before I make a big hit on Broadway. Whoo. Steady. Watch the trim. Oh, it's great up here. No problems. MAN: Look, look up there. WOMAN: What is that? Look at that thing. MAN 2: Some kind of a bird. MAN 1 : No, it's a hang-glider. I wish I were a bird. The chrome-breasted input eater. Dream on, Johnny. Landing area, six o'clock. Beginning final approach. Hm. What's this? Oh, aesthetic input. Sculptures, modern art. Hmm. An early Brancusi? Please, darling, it's a Hankoff. It's gaunt, angular-- Repulsive. Hm? [WHIMPERS] [♪♪♪] What do you think, Mr. Slater? We can call it Funny Fingers. Sandy, now you've been with us how long? Two months, and you still haven't found one item I'd even consider carrying. The robots, sir. I found those. Where are they? You're dealing with a street hustler. Come on, Sandy, get with it. He's not a hustler. He's a robotics engineer. He worked for the government. He's very, very business-like. A total professional. [BEN CLEARS THROAT] Pardon. Um... Delivery boy. Oh. Sorry. That was my boss. Sorry. Yeah, now listen, Ben, what's going on with those robots? We're getting close to the deadline. We're manufacturing them like gang-bangers. Busters. Gangbusters. Busters. Yeah. Okay, good. Good. Totally professional. I knew I could count on you. Ben, I can count on you, can't I? Sandy, that Pogo Stick guy is waiting for you upstairs. Oh. Um... I gotta run. Contact me as soon as the complete shipment is ready, okay? Sandy? Excuse me, it's time to tell you something which is very important. Yeah. I have a need to explain. Oh, God. There's a problem, isn't there? You're not gonna be able to make the robots on time? I knew it, I knew it. Mr. Slater, he tells us don't take chances, so I don't, and I take a chance and then-- No, please, everything's okay. This is not my current discussion of topic. Ben, then what is? Well... I am wishing to say there is a great deal of weather today. [♪♪♪] Hey, you know you have attractive shoes and earrings. Thank you. I am fascinated by your hypnotic blue eyes. I mean brown. They're brown. Ben-- It's small talk. Chatchit to increase the relationship. Oh, no. Ben, you don't have to make small talk. We're already in business, but what you do have to make are those damn little robots. And I really got to run, so why don't you go back to work, okay? Yes, I shall be damn sure telling you when the robots are to be completed. To damn to be harder. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hmm. Maybe a new wardrobe would help. Sixty regular. [♪♪♪] Great fit. Fashion statement. [HUMMING] Mixing in with all the other living bipeds. I'm just like you, except I'm from out of town. GIRL: Look at him. JOHNNY: They're buying it. Wow! Ohh. Beautiful architecture. Edifice, Romanesque. [WOMEN LAUGHING] JOHNNY: Yes. Ohh. Can someone direct me to the answers, please? Oh, maybe that's where the answers are. Hello. Yes, my child? Hello. Need input. Input, well, that's what I'm here for, son. People dislike me. Call me droid, ugly, mother-- My goodness. Well, I've been called a few names myself. I understand it. It always hurt. We all want to be liked. But it doesn't really matter what people think of you. It doesn't? No. What matters is what you do, how you live what the Lord thinks about you. We're all equal before him. All equal? But I'm different. I'm a-- No, you're not. No matter what you may have done, you're as deserving as anyone else. You possess the immortal soul. That makes you equal. Soul? Yes, input from Bible, Koran, Upanishads. Well, I lean towards the Bible, myself. I possess immortal soul? Of course you do, my son. You're human, right? No, I'm a machine. But I am alive. Now this is confession. You don't play games in the house of God. Not games. Have questions, need answers. Fine, then come to confession yourself. Don't send a machine. You can't confess by remote control. Now, out. Get out. O'MALLEY: Hey, look at that thing over there. MENDEZ: You think that's the boozer that trashed the bookstore? How many of these could there be? Hm. All right, fun's over. Oh, police officer. Can you answer questions for me? Just the facts. Whoever's running this thing, this is the police, come out now. But I am cut. Here I am. Listen up now. We got complaints on this thing. Complaints? I did something wrong? Hey! All right. Ooh! O'MALLEY: This is your last chance. Either you come cut now or we're impounding this piece of equip-- But I am not equipment. Am passerby, man on street, average Joe. Is this thing for real? Sure. I'm just on my way to pick up the kids and my wife. Yeah, my wife, Morgan Fairchild. Yeah, that's the ticket. Ohh. You will book me, Danno? I will make your day? Do not pass go? I'm underage, you know. [♪♪♪] MENDEZ: Okay, hold it there. Mug shots? The chief said get a photo record of it. What are we supposed to do? This jail is for human beings. They may be scum, but they're human beings. But I am alive. Read my lip lights. I think, therefore I am. Take it down to stolen goods. I am not stolen goods. Out! But hath not a robot eyes, hath not a robot hands? Organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed? Yeah, battery fluid, maybe. Let me get this straight. You tried to sell Number Johnny Five? Yeah. But it fell through. So where is he now? I lost him. Oh, I see. So you lost him. Oh, well. [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hey, take it easy. I just misplaced him, you know. Like your car keys, your-- How are you misplacing a 700-pound car key? Don't come any closer. You coward. Dirty old snake in the grass. [GUN COCKS] Benjamin Jarvee? Jahrvi. Oh, hello. [♪♪♪] BEN: Stolen goods warehouse? He's looking to you like a household appliance? Number Johnny Five. Are you operational? Say something to me. Hubcaps, corn dog, soul. What is this? He is delicate equipment. A completely unique self-mobile microcomputer robotics system. Yeah, we thought it was that. Okay, Johnny Five, you're free to go. Okay. BEN: What are these foolish clothings you're wearing? Attempt to lock human, fit in, belong. Unsuccessful. [♪♪♪] Now, when people are looking at you, they see a machine, so they are treating you like a machine. But this causes strange feeling, emotion. It's not good. What emotion is this? It feels like desert, wasteland. Can you explain a little more explicitly, please? Unpleasant, hollow, cold. Is it loneliness? Loneliness, solitude. Yes, I have read about this in many books. Francis Bacon said: "A crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of pictures." Oh, well, you're hitting the nail right between the eyes. Johnny Five, you should become accustomed to this feeling because this is the way life is being usually. Since I am leaving India, I too am having much loneliness in this lifetime. You're having loneliness too? But you're human. Well, yes, humans are everywhere, this is true. But for just two of these humans to be getting together to not to be lonely, it is very, well-- Complicated? Correct. Because out of all these humans, there is only one that I am wanting to be the yin for my yang. Which one human? Sandy Banatoni, the human. Oh. Oh, every time I'm being near her, I sweat in the palms. The duckbumps, I am so-- Like a sweaty duck. No. Afraid. Afraid to be rejected. Rejection makes you lonely? Oh, yes. You see, we have much in common. You are lonely because no one is believing you are alive and I am lonely because Sandy Banatoni is not knowing I'm alive. But, Benjamin, I can help you. Oh, no, no, no, I am completely un-helpable. I cannot be a fast-talking socially-type person. But in the bookstore, I scanned many megabytes on male-female relationships, courtship and dating rituals, romance novels, poetry. I could give you input. Number Johnny Five, you would be doing this for me? Why, yes. You're my friend. Oh, that is wonderful. If you are even just helping me to speak to Sandy, well, I am jumping with joy. Well, hey, give me five, hombre. Why, yes, and give me the three. Oh. [BOTH LAUGHING] MAN: No, catch fish fresh every day. WOMAN: No, those fish are old. SAUNDERS: Look, you have no background in this field at all. There is no way to get that robot to do what we want. Sounds like a pretty good idea to me. We sure as hell can't get rid of it. We can't even get our asses into the goddamn building, so why shouldn't we get the robot to help us? It's a "computer." It probably has custom operating system. Hey, you're the expert. The jewels go to the museum in two days. We're flat out of time, buddy. So, what's your brilliant plan? Exactly. There is no other plan. This will be our only opportunity. Now you two just keep that Indian fella and his partner out of that building. Let me deal with the robot. BEN: You have selected an appropriate location for my date? JOHNNY: Yes, right on Sandy's way home. I also remembered another great book: Dating Do's and Don'ts for Modern Teens. BEN: Are you able to hear me? [OVER MICROPHONE] Are you able to hear me? Ten-four, good buddy. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Ah. And with a wave of my magic antenna... [ANTENNA BEEPING] [TIRES SCREECH] JOHNNY: Presto. Go, go, go. Now. Do it. Okay, okay. Lord Rama. [WHISTLING "YANKEE DOODLE DANDY"] DRIVER: The ignition system's fouled up somehow. Sorry, folks. Ben? Oh, the Sandy. Sandy, what a coincidence you're here. SANDY: This is so weird. I was just thinking about you. And now here you are. BEN: Yes, uh... "Say there, Sandy, isn't that a swell dress you're wearing tonight?" Thanks. "If it is okay with your mom and pop, would you like to go to a malt shop for a cheeseburger?" Uh, sure. Why not? Ohh. SANDY: A malt shop? BEN: Well, Hungarian malts. Very good. Oh, no. It's a better view. Isn't it strange we should be meeting like this? Meet, closeness, proximity, yes. Well, "the goal of two ones who share proximity on a physical plane is to achieve a double oneness on the metaphysical plane." Ben, don't go weird on me. Just tell me you are making the robots and everything is really okay, right? "Say, doll, this mug's got more moves than you got curves. I cracked that case hours ago." Does that mean you're done? On time, like I wanted? Yes, definitely. Yes? Great. Great. SANDY: I'll arrange to have them picked up tomorrow. [MEOWING] This is terrific. I know they're gonna sell. I have a good feeling about this. And, you know, this is great for me too. I mean, especially at this stage of my career. Stage. Oh, that's a good one. "Oh, well, I am thinking all the world is a stage." SANDY: Yeah? Well, yeah. JOHNNY: Hey. SANDY: Yeah. BEN: All the world is a stage. JOHNNY: Get off, get off. You know Shakespeare? "Are you troubled by irregularity?" JOHNNY: Hey, get off, Felix, Sylvester, Garfield. Do I look like a mouse? Well, "it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken." Ben, you're not doing any drugs, are you? I mean-- Oh, no, no, no. [JOHNNY BARKING] I just knew this guy cnce who started talking like you before he decided he was god. God. God? Jehovah, Krishna, Lord of Lords. I think he needs some coffee. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] French now, huh? Every time I meet you, I think to myself, "Is he naturally this eccentric? Or is this just an act or what?" Hey! Move those balloons. Move them. I mean, what are you really like? Oh. I see. No answer to that one. Why are guys like that? Go on. I've never been able to figure it out. SANDY: And all the guys I ever met were exactly the same way. When talking about themselves. Me? SANDY: Their feelings and stuff. Yeah, you. SANDY: It's really irritating, I just don't get it at all. Okay. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Guys just smile. [BEN SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Wait. I know a little Spanish. Oh, no, no, no. My mother sleeps with your dog? Oh, no. Well, that's an expression in my country where sometimes we are speaking Spanish. It does not mean that your mother is sleeping with my dog. Oh, no, no. It means that the people that she is sleeping with, they are like dogs. I mean that they are friendly and loyal. Oh, no, what a maroon. I think I better go. Oh, no, no. I am-- Please, I am sorry, huh? I am confessing to you now, Sandy. Everything that I have been saying, it has been coming to you not from me, but from my friend who has been controlling remotely the sign. [♪♪♪] You mean you've had someone prompting you? Yes, please, I must escape this embarrassment. Don't. No, no, wait. Sit. Please, sit down. Do you mean that you're interested in me personally? Yes. So that's what's been going on. You've been trying so hard. Ben, the expense alone. Well, I am wanting so much to be able to speak to you with my tongue untied. It's really sweet. You could've just told me. So, what do we talk about now? Well, do you like music? No, no, no. Don't tell me, don't tell me. This, this, this one is "Bo Diddley" performed by Mr. Diddley himself. What year? Nineteen-- Fifty-five. Fifty-five. Oh, that's great. [BO DIDDLEY'S "BO DIDDLEY" PLAYING ON JUKE BOX] Yes, I think this Mr. Diddley person did more for this country than Warden D. Hardon. Harding. Harding. [LAUGHS] SANDY: It's okay, Ben. Oh, my, how time is fun when you're having flies, huh? Wait, I know this great all-night rock 'n' roll place. An after-hours club. You up for it? Oh, yes, I am in all directions for it most definitely. We need a cab. No, I will get it, allow me, sir. Ma'am. Pardon me. Taxi, taxi. God, you can't even get a cab in this city. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [SCREAMS] Oh, did I startle you? What is that? What is what? That. There are 2312 taxicabs in this city. And there's one now. Hey, taxi, cab. [JOHNNY WHISTLES] And bull's eye. [TIRES SCREECH] [DRIVER GRUNTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] SANDY: Ben, what the hell is that? It looks a giant one of your toys. Yeah, well-- But yes, it does, doesn't it? Ben, will you please tell me what that thing is? Thank you for stopping. Please. Excuse me. Number Johnny Five. Thank you, friend. Now, you go back home. Okay. [HUMMING] JOHNNY: Okay, all loaded. One thousand toy robots. Is that it, Robby? Mm-hm. You enjoying planet Earth? What? Take me to your leader. Oh, what's this? Hey. This is XL-7, over and out. [LAUGHING] Hmm. Oh, Oscar. Hola, dude. What's happening? [DOOR OPENS] Number Johnny Five, the date was such a success. We talked. We danced. We drank champagne. Well, she sure came through with the money. Benny, our first big score. Look at that, half those zeroes are yours. [COUGHING] Come on, you're gonna hold a grudge all your life? Be happy. We're finally making it. Oh, no. No, no way. Who are you guys, anyway? [♪♪♪] Five? Number Johnny Five? JOHNNY: Oh, Oscar, you're such a friendly guy. I always enjoy talking to you. Well, I've always enjoyed talking to you. But you know something, Johnny? I'm worried about our friends, Benjamin and Frederick. Huh? Frederick is not my friend. [CAR STARTS AND DRIVES OFF] Well, to be perfectly honest, I never liked him either. But Benjamin is our friend, right? True blue. Now, with all the break-ins, the vandalism, the sudden attacks by those thugs, you and I have to make sure Benjamin is safe. Okay. Now, across the street out there is a little secret room that I happen to know about, and it's a perfect hiding place. And I thought Benjamin could use an escape tunnel to that room in case those villains come back. I worked it out in intricate detail. It's taken me a long time, let me tell you. Borrowing the blueprints, purchasing equipment. Here, let me show you. All right, get in there. Oh, dear. FRED: I get it. Industrial espionage. See, we got a hot toy, so the big boys want it, right? Relax, get comfortable. You're gonna be here for a while. Somebody will let you out Monday morning. FRED: Oh, yeah? You screw around with Johnny Five, he'll knock you into the next zip code, pal. Hey, the robot's working for us now, pal. And when he's finished, we're gonna turn him to aluminum siding. No, sir, please. Now, I wonder if you would help me finish my hiding place for our friend, Benjamin. Certainly, Oscar. I'd detach my right arm for Benjamin. And my left arm, or both arms. Oh, wait. Subterranean excavation requires many permits. Department of Water, telephone company. City planners. I have them, every single one. Okay. Low bridge. This place is a mess. Okay. [RUMBLING] [GIGGLING] I'm sorry I tried to sell your goddamn robot, okay? It was a dirty trick. I'm a jerk, I'm a sleazeball. Yeah, you're getting warmer. It's just that when you owe as much money as I do, it kind of puts you under pressure. And who would be foolish enough to loan money to you? Don't rub it in. I had to go to a shark. Oh, dear, and now you're expecting me to believe you borrowed money from a fish? No, no, no, a loan shark. It's somebody, you don't pay them back they start removing popular parts of your anatomy. This shark money, it is what you have used to help me? I did it to help us, give us our big break, you know? You are risking your popular body parts to start our business? Yeah. Yeah, only then, I got greedier. I mean, come on, a robot worth 11 million bucks. I couldn't stand it. I should've known it wouldn't work. That thing ran me all over to hell and gone, which I deserve, I admit. How do you control it, though? Really, Benny, that thing doesn't work so good. Well, there is something in which I have not told you also. The reason that it is so difficult to control is because it is just like you and I. What are you talking about? I mean, it is making a lot of mistakes because it is alive. Alive? OSCAR: I know what it's like for Benjamin, working long hours for very little compensation. I work all day with other people's money. "Lock, but don't touch. Don't make mistakes." They treat me like a machine. Like a machine? This gives you bad emotion. Loneliness, unhappiness. Oh, Oscar. Come here, come here. I understand. So those two dickheads out there, if they smash Johnny Five up, or they shut him down or something, he'll be dead? If he's losing his power, yes. That's it. We gotta get out of here. The two of us together, we can take it. BEN: That's right. One shot, mind over matter. You ready? I'm ready, I'm definitely ready. On three, one, two, three. Oh. Well, my mind is not getting over that matter. That is for certain. Oh, good golly, I just remembered. I am new missing my second date with Sandy. Oh, no. [PHONE RINGING] [THE EVERLY BROTHERS' "BYE BYE LOVE" PLAYING OVER STEREO] [SIGHS] Ugh. Squid. I need squid. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, they screwed up. What? Look. "Doo Wah's Chinese Restaurant and Deli." There's the address right there. We know where we are. [BOTH LAUGHING] But to whom are we to tell this earthquaking news? Right. Doesn't help us to save Number Johnny Five. No, we may be too late. We've been here for hours. It's unfortunate we are not carrying a telephone with us. Oh, well, I left mine in the Mercedes. No, I am speaking seriously. There's a telephone line here. I could wire in the telephone most easily. Hey, Benny, well, can't you use that? I mean, you're a high-tech kind of a guy. Well, can't you make something? You know, send them Morse code or something? [LOW RUMBLING] JOHNNY [SINGING]: ♪ Johnny's in the tunnel with Oscar ♪ ♪ Digging 10 feet below ♪ ♪ Johnny's in the tunnel With Oscar ♪♪ Juicy Fruit. To hold the wire in place.

I thought you knew. No, that means-- What kind of electronics genius are you? I am meaning technically. How am I supposed to know the code? I can't believe you-- Oh, dear.

Now we need to do just one more thing. We need to clear out all my old junk here. Open this box. But, Oscar, cutting hole in bank vault is not damage? Vandalism? Don't be ridiculous.
