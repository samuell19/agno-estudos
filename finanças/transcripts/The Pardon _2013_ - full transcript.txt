TONI (VOICEOVER): Louisiana's always been known for its good old boy background politics. I just never thought I'd get tangled up in it. Those press buzzard's gotten more attention than a two-headed dog. I started out in Shreveport, Louisiana, living in a row of houses that all looked the same. It was across the street from the rail road, because Daddy worked for the Kansas City Southern Railways. After momma died, daddy and my new step momma began to take it out on me. So I left. I was only 12. Aunt Emma took me in for a spell 'til Charlotte's became my new home. I knew the one thing I had going for me was my looks. I came in through the back door as Annie B. McQuiston. But when I left in '39, it was through the front door as Toni Jo Henry. [lively chatter] Miss Charlotte ran the place, better known as Charlotte's, the finest brothel in Shreveport. Miss Charlotte charmed lawyers and the police in her back pocket by offering her services for free. I never did learn to play that piano, but I sure loved the sound of it. I dreamt for hours of a better life, a different life. - I heard you lost another fight cowboy. - Yeah? - Mm. - Well, you should see the other guy. - Mm. - Besides, it's worth it if the loser's purse gets me here. TONI (VOICEOVER): Every little girl dreams of her knight in shining armor. And I was no different. - I just don't want to mess up that pretty face of yours. - Ladies, it's criminal. But I have got to get some sleep. Goodnight. - Goodnight cowboy. Maybe I'll come cheer for you on Saturday afternoon. You think Miss Charlotte will give us the time off? - No. - Don't you never mind him, Toni Jo. - You sure know how to make a man feel like a man. - Mr. Dupre is waiting for you. Just keep him happy. - I just need to freshen up. - Yeah, sure. [gasp] - Ah! Ah! [grunt] Ah! - Oh! - Ah! Ah! - Oh. - So how long have you been fighting? - Since I was born. Six older brothers, you get plenty of sparring partners. - That's a premium right hook you got. - One of the many tricks I learned from the old man. Great role model. - Yeah. I had one of those too. Well, I better get back. Miss Charlotte will be looking for me. - I'd like to see you again. - Well, you know where Miss Charlotte's is. - I meant away from there. - Like where? What do you want? - Just some dinner together. Seems like you're looking for someone a little more polished. - Well, who ain't? But this point, I'd settle or just a good looking cowboy dude. - Lookie here, lookie here. Hey now, I'm a paying customer. - Put that down Toni Jo! Put it down. I'll fix you up Mr. Johnston. Ain't no hog tie. - Well, all right. [inaudible]? Come over here. [giggling] -(WHISPERING) Why don't we go on upstairs? [laughing] [music playing] [cheering] - You did good up there. COWBOY: Tonight at least. Usually, I end up with a face full of hamburger. [laughing] - Where's Toni Jo? - Oh, she's upstairs. And she's alone cowboy. You sure have been taken up all Toni Jo's time lately. - And I pay for it, don't I? What are you doing? - Nothing. Don't! Don't! I need that. - You're a lying drug addict. - Please! Please! - What's it going to be? Me or this dope monkey on your bed? - But I need it. I need it! - You choose. - You don't understand! I need it! Ah! I can't! No! No! Give it to me. Give it. Give it to me! Ah! - Last chance. You choose. [crying] You don't have to do it on your own. [crying] - Get away from me! Get away from me! No! - I want momma! - Your momma's dead. She can't help you now, lazy brat. Oh, where are you going? Huh? "Sorry! -(MOCKINGLY) I'm sorry. That's about the first damn thing you said right. Clean up this Pigs-TY! No! No! Come back here! Don't let me [inaudible]! Come back! Come back here! Come back! 'Nd.! I'm not going back in there again! - Don't go acting all innocent with me. You're going to service these men. Come on! Come on! -(CRYING) I don't have to listen to you! - Do like the good book says, honor thy father and mother. And I'm your momma now little miss big mouth, so you listen to me. Now get! - You're doing great. You're through the worst of it. - Oh, I'm just so sorry your momma went and died on you. - I'll be real good. I'll clean the house real good, and I'll fix my own dinner. - Is Bertha treating you right darling? - Those men smell [inaudible] Emma. Please don't make me go back home! - Oh, it's all right child. You just say your prayers. You'll see. It's going to be OK. Just sleep now. (WHISPERING) Shh. - Sleep baby. Just sleep. Slow down honey. You're going to make yourself sick. - Ain't nothing in the world that's going to stop me from eating right now. [laughing] Except maybe that. - Let's do something really crazy. - Like what? - Let's get hitched. - What? COWBOY: I want to do right by you, Mrs. Henry. - Toni Jo Henry. It has a nice ring to it. Wait 'til the girl's here. They're going to be so jealous. - And you're never going to set foot in Miss Charlotte's again. You hear me? - Cowboy, don't be so silly. There could never be anyone but you. - All right. Bring it in. I don't have to tell you boys how important this here fight is. The winners gets to go to Beaumont for a whole series of fights with the big boys. Now, I want a clean, fair fight. Got it? All right. Get in your corners. Let's do it. [bell] - Oh, sorry. Sorry. I can't believe we're going to Texas! - I'm not so sure that's a good thing. - Well, you don't have a hair on your ass if you don't go. [laughs] - Eh, thing is I got in a little trouble in Texas. - What's all the trouble? COWBOY: No big deal really. It happened so long ago, probably nobody even remembers it. Besides, we need the money. TONI: Let's just hope no one remembers it, dumb ass. - I guess the honeymoon's over. - Well, I don't recall ever having one. You OK? - Well then, Texas will be our honeymoon. I'll make sure it's worth the Wait. - Well, ain't you a sight for sore eyes. - When'd they let you out? - Which time? Ain't you going to introduce me? - This is my Wife, Toni Jo. Toni Jo, this is Arkie. - What kind of a name is Arkie? - I never thought I'd see you ever settle down with just one gal. - Well, it just goes to show you, I guess. - Now listen, friend, I'll keep your bride company tomorrow while you fight, give her a shoulder to cry on when you lose. Eh-- never could take a joke. [laughing] - It seems to me I got your ass out of more than a few scrapes. - Sure you did. Claude ever tell you about that time-- - Shut up Arkie. - Yeah. Too bad about Buck. - Let's go [inaudible]. See you around Arkie. - All's I'm saying is Bonnie and Clyde should have been treated that way. Got a light? - The Bonnie and Clyde? Ah-- you knew them? - The very ones, little lady. You never told her about the Barrows? - We've come here to check out the competition, not shoot the breeze. - No, I've got something I've got to do anyway. I'll see you around cowboy. By the way, no hard feelings about screwing me over on that last job, huh? [laughing] [bell] - Oh, oh. - Oh, oh, oh. Uh. [grunting] - Oh! - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it! [cheering] - There's my girl. Come here baby. Let's get out of here. - Cowboy Henry? - Hey! Hey! Get your hands off of him! He won that fight fair and square! -It's all right baby. We'll work this out, and I'll be back before you know it. - Sure. We'll work it all out. - B-- but, but you can't take him. It's our honeymoon. - You kill a policeman in Texas, you either swing or die in prison. - Will the defendant please rise. Since you've been found guilty of manslaughter, you're hereby sentenced to 50 years hard labor at the Hudsville State Penitentiary. [gasp] Bailiff, remove the prisoner. - Don't worry baby, I'm going to get you an appeal. - I won't let you down, I promise. - Just don't do anything stupid. - I love you cowboy! COWBOY: I love you too Toni Jo! That was a right fine cheese grit. - Thank you. - Bye bye. - You gonna eat them taters? Hard to know when you'll eat next. - Can we just talk about the plan? - Mm. How much money do you have? They didn't pay him for his last fight, bastards. ARKIE: That don't seem fair. -$50. - That's not bad. TONI: What about you? - I ain't got a pot to piss in right now, but that's getting ready to change. - Great. Did you and cowboy really run with Bonnie and Clyde? - Well, now, I was the one who introduced cowboy to Buck Barrow when We was all in Huntsville. When we got out, pulled a couple bank jobs to get Buck some money so he'd catch up with his brother Clyde. - How many banks? - I don't remember. Hm. Come here. You know, me and you could rob a bank. There's a bank, this little town, Harrell, Arkansas nearabouts where I grew up. - How do we get to Harrell, Arkansas? - We'll get us a car. - Get a car? - Actually, you'll get us a car. But leave it up to me. I'll be in charge of the gun. You can be the getaway driver, just like Bonnie did for Clyde. - I don't know nothing about guns and never learned how to drive. - I'll learn you. It ain't that hard. I think I know somebody who can help with the guns. This'll just take a second. Oh, we got us plenty of guns. Damn bastard only gave us bullets for one gun. Hey! - Well, it seems to me we only need one. - Yeah. Still need a car. Let's Walk the highway. Come on. You be nice to this guy. I'll hide in the bushes. I'll be right there. TONI: OK. JP: You shouldn't be out here all alone young lady. Dangerous. Where you headed? - Actually, my brother and I are on our way to Arkansas. Where you headed? - Well, I was delivering this new car to a friend of mine who lives over in Jennings, Louisiana. I generally don't like to travel on the lord's clay, but-- - Well, that's part way. What do you say? [sighs] - Well, I suppose I could take you all as far as Jennings. Hop on in. - Thank you! --[inaudible] right, right nice of you mister. Don't forget your bags sis. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. TONI: You got everything? Yeah. ARKIE: All right. TONI: Yeah? ARKIE: Yeah. Let's go. JP: It's a beautiful day, isn't it? TONI: Sure is. ARKIE: Sure is. No rain. - So what's your name? - My name's Joseph P. Galloway. Friends call me JP. - Well, it's nice to meet you JP. My name is-- - My name is Clyde. -It's nice to meet you Clyde. [coughs] - So what's your line JP? - I own a car dealership back in Houston. - Ain't you the lucky one? - No ma'am. That lord has shown his smiling face on me and my family. - That's real nice. - Yes ma'am. We're blessed. No ma'am. I don't think you'll find much way out here. It's a-- - Perfect. Just take it easy. Pull over to the side of the road. - Mister, I don't want any trouble, OK? - Well, maybe too late for that JP. Just pull on over JP. JP: Yes sir. ARKIE: Get out. Come on, let's go. Empty out your pockets right up there. Come on! Go. Come on. Let's go. - You can have the money. Just take it. OK? Take it. - This is what you've got? - Yes. I don't travel with much money. - Shut up. Take that watch off too. Hey sis? Open the turtle back. Maybe there's money in there. - What? - The-- the trunk. - Just open it! Come on. - Well, how am I supposed to know that Arkie? I already told you, I don't drive! - M-mister, I won't say anything, I promise! I promise, I won't say anything! Really. - That's swell. All right. Come on. Just please don't kill me. - Come on! Come on POPS! - Please just don't kill me! - Get in there! Get! Get! Double time! Ah! - Sorry JP. JP: Ah! - What'd you go and do that for? - He didn't step it up in the first place, he wouldn't have gotten his hands smashed. Come on, let's go! Come on! Let's go! - Hey, pipe down back there. [sighs] OK. We can't take him to Arkansas. He's making too much noise back here. Find a spot alongside the road. - I don't remember kidnapping being part of the plan. - Things change sweetie pie. You have to learn to use your noggin. What's eating you? Cool off, will you? JP (IN TRUNK): Oh. - Nice car, huh? Bet you wish you could drive it. JP (IN TRUNK): Oh. - Listen. - Don't touch me. - Listen. You through in with me. We're partners. At least 'til the bank job. So you ought to make the best of it. You want to free cowboy, don't you? JP (IN TRUNK): Oh. - Driving doesn't look all that hard. Maybe I could be the getaway driver. - That's your ticket. JP (IN TRUNK): [moaning] Ah! - Now, come on. Get out of there. Come on! - Oh. [grunting] - How's your hands JP? - Lulu's going to be worried sick. - Be OK. All right. Take your clothes off. - Wha-- what'd you say? What'd he say? - You heard me. Now. Come on! - Ah. It'll slow him down. I don't want him running for help soon as we drive off. [grunting] - You two know you could end up in a penitentiary for this, don't you? - Listen mister, you'd better shut up and do what he says. - Come on! Let's go! [inaudible], take the gun. Keep it trained on him. - Son, think about what you're doing. Don't kill me. ARKIE: Get up. I, I said get up. Toni Jo, come on. TONI: What are you doing? JP: I'm praying for myself and for your eternal soul. TONI: I don't need your stinking prayers. ARKIE: Toni Jo, give me the gun. [gun shot] - Have you read this? - Where'd they find the body? - Over in [inaudible] rice farm behind a haystack. - Poor guy's totally nude. Did Clemet file a report? - Not his final report. There's more. There was a leak to the newspaper that the guy was brutally tortured with a pair of pliers before he was slain, sexually mutilated. - Jeez. Did she confess? - She clammed up at the inquest. One look at the jury and the spectator, she refused to answer any of Clement's questions. - But she was indicted? She give up her accomplice? - She refers to him as the little yellow rat. We're arranging for her to go to Beaumont to visit with her husband, Cowboy Henry. - So she's receiving special treatment? - In exchange for the name. Her husband's serving time at Huntsville for manslaughter, killing a former policeman. - Nice couple. I don't like this whole business of them getting together. - That's the only Way she would cooperate. - Let's keep this whole mess under wraps. - Have you appointed counsel for her yet? - Yep. Those two young tax attorneys. [laughing] - I messed up real good this time. (WHISPERING) I really messed up. - Give up Arkie. It's your only chance. Our only chance. - They want me to look at some books. - Give them what they want sugar. - What's Arkie's real name? - I don't know. He just went by so many names, we always called him Arkie. - I love you cowboy. -(WHISPERING) I love you too. [crying] - Calloway was a close friend of mine. I want the death penalty. - I understand and agree. - I've arranged for Calloway's widow and daughter to be here for the trial. - Make sure you prep him well before Wednesday. I want the jury's sympathy. - Oh, they're as anxious to see these two swing as we are. - Miss Henry? Your lawyers are here to see you. - That no good yellow rat. Figures. Arkie put all the blame on me. - Miss Henry, [inaudible] about a court to defend you. May we have a moment of your time? - My name is Clement Moss. This is-- - Norman Ander-- - Norman Anderson. - Norman Anderson. May we call you Annie? - I don't go by that sissy name in your report. -[inaudible]. -It's Toni Jo. - Let me get y'all a couple of chairs. - Thank you. -[inaudible]. - Well, don't worry. I don't bite. I just use pliers. Let's make something real clear from the get go. These newspapers are full of crap. There was no torture. - Y'all just holler when uh, your business is done here. - Yes sir. Will do. - So what number am I? - S-- excuse me? - Well, how many murder cases have y'all tried? - Well, actually, this is our very first one. - First one. CLEMENT: We filed a motion with the judge to be withdrawn from the case. We're tax attorneys. -(WHISPERING) Tax attorneys? - He denied our motion. It couldn't have come for a worse time for us. I mean-- - He's finishing up this year's tax returns. NORMAN: --both our returns. - Well, I wasn't actually planning on filing a tax return this year, so I guess I won't be needing your services. - We can understand your concern and hesitation about us, but we want to assure you, we will do everything possible to get you a fair trial. NORMAN: Yes. - Fair trial? Sure. Well, so let's have it. What have y'all come up with for my defense? - Oh. Um, sorry, just-- uh, OK. Um, first We have to pick the right jury. And then we have to-- - Yeah, right. Read the papers. They have me swinging before the trial even begins. - Norman and I brought that to the attention of the court. We asked the judge to change the location of the venue of the trial, because of all the-- - Because of the press. - But it was denied. - Well, it looks like I'm screwed every which way. [laughs] - Not entirely. Our motion to have your case severed from [inaudible] Was granted. S--severed means your trials will be separated. That's a good thing. - That's very good. -It's good. - We-- we need uh, information about your past. - Yes, we want to establish a, your background. - I don't need people feeling all sorry for me. - Well, actually, you do. It's part of your defense. - I ain't airing out my dirty laundry for them holy rollers. - Some of those holy rollers might have sympathy for you because of your history and actually be against the death penalty. - A fat chance. - That's her. - Miss Galloway, would you make a statement concerning Mrs. Henry's trial which opens here tomorrow? - Naturally, everyone must know how I feel about the matter. REPORTER: Ma'am? Ma'am? - Mr. Copeland, Mr. Copeland. Can I get a statement from your Mr. Copeland? - We, referring to Mrs. Galloway and her daughter, will insist upon the death penalty for both the man and the woman. And I cannot see or understand how a jury could assess anything other than the death penalty. You could quote me on that. REPORTER: Give a quote here sir? Ma'am? [whispered chatter] - Understand Pete, you make a call. I'm just, what I'm saying is you have to-- - Order in my courtroom. Proceed with jury selection. - Ah, Mr. Albert Stokes. Mr Stokes, I'd like to ask you that if you were satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, could you vote for the death penalty? - Yes sir, I could. PROSECUTOR: The state accepts this juror. - Um, Mr. Stokes? [clears throat] Uh, Mr. Stokes, if you're accepted as a defendant in this case, uh, uh, as a juror in this case, and if, if the jury should determine that the defendant was guilty of murder, would you be able to give uh, consideration-- Your honor, would you kindly direct my learned colleague to speak up? The people of the great state of Louisiana would like to hear what he has to say. - Mr. Anderson, speak up. - Yes sir-- (LOUDER) Yes sir, your honor. Wo-- would you be able to give consideration to a verdict other than capital punishment. That is to say, life imprisonment? - Yes sir. - Would the opinion that you have formed uh, accounts or discussions, you may have had about the case with, you know, with you know, the mailman, the milkman, the vegetable man, or, or, you know, the boys at the hardware store, or church people say, or you know, whoever the-- whoever really would have a conversation about the case with you with that case, the discussions about it, uh, easily affect your views? Does the opinion that you form easily effect your views? - It would. [coughs] - Thank you. - Look, your honor, the defense asks that this juror be excused. - I see no reason why Mr Stokes cannot serve as a juror. He is accepted. Next? - Your honor, I object. - Overruled. - Pay him no attention. - Oh, never mind. - The state is satisfied with the jury. - Oh, your honor? The defense is not satis-- - Your honor, I object. - On what grounds? --[inaudible], I'd like to introduce the Texas enterprise and late Charles American press. But your honor, in these news-- thank you. In these newspapers, Mr. Copeland and Miss Galloway have made remarks indicating that they will settle for nothing less than a hanging verdict. (WHISPERING) And if they are allowed to sit directly in front of the jury, it is with the sole purpose of arousing sympathy. I therefore request they be moved to outside the rail. - Overruled. They're fine where they are. Take a seat Mr. Anderson. Mr. Paterson, are you ready to begin? - I am your honor. I would like to court to recognize and admit before this court assistant prosecutor, JP Copeland, a Houston attorney, retained by the widow and daughter of the murdered Galloway. - Objection, your honor, on the grounds that this Texas lawyer's not qualified before the Louisiana bar, nor is he an elector of the parish and state, and therefore, cannot serve as a special prosecutor in state court in Louisiana. JUDGE: Overruled. - Your honor, the defense-- --[inaudible], I said I've already ruled on your objection, and it's overruled. File a bill of exception. Mr. Copeland will be allowed to serve as a special prosecutor during this trial. Bailiff? Swear him in. - Your boys, they didn't do such a bad job, considering your case is moving right along quick. - Quick to the gallows. - Now, you don't know that. - I know plenty. - Is the state ready to call its first witness? - My name is Fred Arnold, and I'm a professional photographer. - Did you take this picture and develop it to the present state that it's in now? - Yes sir. This is the photograph that I took. - The state now offers in evidence this photograph, identified as exhibit A. - Ob-- objection to the reception of the photograph in evidence, reason that it is unnecessary to introduce in that its only effect would be to inflame and prejudice the minds of the jurors. That if the state wishes to establish death, the testimony of the coroner should suffice. - Overruled. The jury can see the photograph. - No further question. - My name is Dr. E. L. Clement. I've been the [inaudible] Parish corner for the past 25 years. - Did you examine the body and determine the cause of death? - Yes. Mr. Joseph Galloway died instantly from a gunshot wound to the head fired by a 32 caliber pistol. - Were there any other wounds or injuries? - I object, uh, as to relevance. Any other wounds to the body did not cause death. - Overruled. Dr. Clement's an expert. I'll allow the question. - There was a severe laceration of the hand, clean to the bone. [gasps] - Order in the courtroom. - How did the defendant appear at the inquest? - She was totally unresponsive. She offered no testimony, like she didn't even care. - Objection. Your honor, speculative. I mean, how could he possibly know how she felt? - Sustained. The jury will disregard the last statement by this witness. - Thank you. That's all Dr. Clement. - Does the defense have any questions? - Dr. Clement? Other than a cut to Mr. Calloway's hand, was there any other evidence suggesting torture? - No sir. [gasps] - Quiet. This is my courtroom, and I'll have quiet. - Thank you sir. No further questions. - Dr. Clement, you may step down. Call your next witness. - Sheriff Reid, When was the first time you encountered the defendant? - We took custody of her own Saturday, February the 17th from Captain George McQuiston. - And what happened next? - Well, at that point, Trooper Fremont Lebleiu and myself escorted her on a search for the body. At first, I thought she was blowing smoke up at us, but uh, she said she'd take us to the body. So we went looking. - You sure there's a body out here? - I told you, we left his body in one of these here fields. You think you'd be a little more interested. - Well, why don't you tell me why on God's green earth you'd come out here to shoot a man and leave him in here to rot? - We needed his car. - Who's we? - I'm no stool pigeon. Even if he is a little yellow rat. - That's all fine and good Miss Henry, but there's been no report of a missing persons. And you can run a good dog where there ain't no rabbits who'll run him out. Now, I have about run out. We're going to hitch this wagon back to the house. [gasp] - This is it! That's it! Right there! -(MUTTERING) This woman is nuttier than squirrel droppings. -(WHISPERING) Told you. - Lebleiu, we're going to need the coroner out here, pronto. Turn around, Miss Henry. You're under the arrest for murder. - Is this the gun you received from Trooper Lebleiu, allegedly used by Mrs. Henry? - That is the gun. - And was the bullet retrieved from the deceased, Mr. Galloway, fired from this gun? Ballistics report verified that that was the gun used to kill JP Galloway. - Your honor, we entered this as exhibit B, and we have no further questions. JUDGE: The defense may cross examine this witness. - Sheriff Reid, did you escort Mrs. Henry to the Beaumont Penitentiary? - Yes, I did. CLEMENT: For what purpose? - Well, We wanted to find out who her accomplice was. That was the only way she was going to cooperate with us. - And isn't it true that on the return trip to Lake Charles, Miss Henry made a statement to you regarding the death of JP Galloway? - On the way back from Beaumont, she said that she did not fire the shot. - No further questions. - Redirect, your honor. - Sheriff Reid, was this the first time that Mrs. Henry had declared her innocence? - That was the very first she'd said on that. - No further questions your honor. - Call your next witness. - The state calls George McQuiston to the stand. - George McQuiston, will you please take the stand? - Sheriff Reid? - Yes sir. -Issue a bench warrant for the arrest of George McQuiston. SHERIFF REID: Will do your honor. JUDGE: Quiet. Call your next witness. PROSECUTOR: State your name please for the court. - Mrs. Emma Holt. PROSECUTOR: And what is your relationship to the accused? - I'm Annie B's-- uh, Toni Jo's aunt. I've always been known to her as Auntie Beatrice. PROSECUTOR: Thank you Mrs. Holt, but just answer the question. And when was the last time you saw your niece before she showed up unexpectedly at your home? - I hadn't seen my niece for four years until the night she came to my house. I could see that she was very nervous. And I could tell something was wrong. I just wished George was there. PROSECUTOR: Please Mrs. Holt, tell the court who George is. - George McQuiston is my brother, and he's captain of the state police. We're all very proud of him. He's nothing like Annie's pa, the way he'd-- PROSECUTOR: Please Mrs. Holt. Just answer the question. - I'm sorry. But you have to understand, Annie B. Had to leave home when she was only 1 2 years old. I taught the baby how to sew. I was like her momma. PROSECUTOR: Your honor, I'd like to request a recess but reserve the right to further question this witness at a future time. - Granted. Witness must step down. Court will recess and resume tomorrow morning at 9 AM. - Got to get a better [inaudible]. Files are all over the place. - Did you and do you have a close relationship-- - I'd like to recall Mrs. Emma Holt to the stand. - You were telling us yesterday that you had not heard from Mrs. Henry in four years? - Yes sir. - And what happened when she did contact you? - Well, it was the middle of the night. - Tell me dear, what's wrong? - I've gone and done something terrible Aunt Emma. - Lord have mercy child. What has that no good husband of yours gone and done? Is it cowboy you call him? - You don't understand. - I shot a man in the heart. [gasps] [sobbing] - Oh. Oh child, no. [crying] I'll give your Uncle George a call. He'll know what to do. Shh. - And she told you, I shot a man? - Yes. But I'm not sure if that's what she meant to say. She was in a state of shock. - Mrs. Holt, is this the gun that Tony Jo Henry showed you? - It could be. I don't know guns that much. - Is this the gun you gave to the police officers? - Objection. The witness said she wasn't sure. - Overruled. The weapon's already been established as the gun the police confiscated from the old home. - You then called your brother, George McQuiston? - Yes. PROSECUTOR: And what did you tell him? - I told him to come as soon as he could, that Annie B. was in trouble. PROSECUTOR: And your brother came? - He came with two policemen to get Annie B. - Mrs. Holt, do you know where your brother is? - No sir. - No further questions. JUDGE: Does the defense have any questions? - Yes, your honor. [clears throat] Mrs. Holt-- did you and do you have a close relationship with your niece? - Yes. I raised her a spell. - And what was her childhood like? - Objection. I fail to see the relevance of this case your honor. - Your honor, We will show you the relevance by demonstrating the conditions of Miss Henry's childhood. - Allowed, overruled. - How old was Annie B.-- also known as Toni Jo Henry-- when she came to live with you? AUNT EMMA: She was almost 12. CLEMENT: And where was this 11-year-old girl's momma? - Her momma passed on to the good Lord when she was 10. TB ate her up. My brother and his pa, he made her get a job at the macaroni factory in Treeport. - So she was forced to leave school. And how long was she at the macaroni factory? -'Til right before she came to stay with me. The factory fired her when they found out about her momma dying at the TB and all. - Mrs. Holt-- was Tony Jo's father kind to her? - No. He let that no good whiskey turn him into a mean man. He didn't used to be so mean. - Mrs. Holt-- did Toni Jo's father, your brother, ever hit her? - Poor little thing. She always had bruises on her body. - Objection. Cause for speculation, your honor. Children do fall down and they get bruises. JUDGE: Sustained. - Mrs. Holt, you testified earlier that you told Toni Jo that you would help her if she told you what happened. Is that correct? - Yes. I wanted to help you baby. - Please address your comments to the court Mrs. Holt. - Did Toni Jo confess to you after you told her you'd help her? - I think so. She just looked so hopeless. So lost. - Mrs. Holt, you stated earlier that your niece, Toni Jo Henry, told you she shot a man in the heart. Is that correct? - Yes. - You're sure she said, in the heart? Not the head? - Yes sir. - That's all then. Thank you for your testimony. JUDGE: You may step down Miss Holt. - Prosecution rests your honor. - The defense may call its first witness. BAILIFF: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? - I do. BAILIFF: Please be seated. - Who's your husband? - Claude D. Henry. - You and your husband devoted? - Yes sir. CLEMENT: He been in any trouble? - Yes sir. - And what was his trouble? TONI: Murder. - Was he charged with killing someone? TONI: Yes sir. CLEMENT: Was he convicted of this crime? TONI: Yes sir. - Where'd you meet Mr. Galloway? - About one or 1/2 mile this side of Orange, Texas. - Did you and Finnon Burkes both have guns? - Yes sir. - Were both the guns loaded? - No sir, only one. - Well, who had that gun? - Finnon Burkes. - So Burkes had the only loaded gun? - Yes sir. - Come on. Tell the jury what happened. - After We got in the car, Arkie pulled out his gun and told him to stop the car. - Go on. - Well, Arkie said that he'd better get in the turtle back. And he slammed that hood down so hard. Well, it cut up that fellow's hand real bad. CLEMENT: Who drove? - Arkie. I never learned how to drive. - So Burkes drove the car? TONI: Yes sir. - Go on. - Well, Arkie drove for awhile and stopped by the side of a dirt road on account of all the noise that Callaway was making. He uh, made him get out of the turtle back and take his clothes off. There was some conversation. I, I don't remember what it was about. I picked up the clothes, and Mr. Galloway went behind the haystack and kneeled down. He said, don't you know you're going to go to the penitentiary for this? And I told him, he'd better think where he would go. And I started back towards the car. [gun shot] [gasp] -(WHISPERING) What'd you do? - I shot him in the heart. - Through the heart? - Yeah. Sounded like a punctured tire. - What happened after you left the rice field? - First, we stopped down the road and burned his clothes. And then Arkie drove us to a little town in Arkansas where we was going to rob a bank. CLEMENT: Did you? - No. CLEMENT: You didn't rob a bank? - There was no bank. I thought you said that there was a bank in this here town that we could hold up. - There used to be. How was I supposed to know it dried up? - Well, now what are we going to do? - Find another one. - Well, it better be soon! We hardly have any money left. ARKIE: Yeah? Well, get me something to drink with that money. - Not not Arkie. We've got to keep our wits about us. ARKIE: Ha. After a day like today, Toni, [inaudible]. - Well, you got his watch. Why don't you use that? ARKIE: Don't give me no lip. You'd better not make me look for it sweetheart. Oh. Well, I used the money to buy a bus to ticket back to Shreveport. And I Walked to Aunt Emma's from there. - Would your Aunt Emma testify about your childhood? Could you describe what it was like growing up in your home? - Objection, irrelevance. The facts of Mrs. Henry's past have been presented to this court. And nothing new can come from this testimony other than to elicit sympathy from the jury. - Your honor, we believe the firsthand account bears listening to, because the defendant was a child of misfortune and a victim of circumstances. - I can see no additional relevant information coming from this line of questioning. Objection sustained. - Your honor-- - Don't try my patience Mr. Moss. The objection is sustained. Now, move on. - No further questions. - You changed your story about who shot the man after you saw your husband. - Yes. - Mrs. Henry, you say you're devoted to your husband, because he cured you of a drug habit. - Yes. - Then you're no longer an addict? - No. - Well, that's wonderful Mrs. Henry. Congratulations. That's all your honor. - You may step down Mrs. Henry. Does the defense have any more questions? - No your honor. The defense rests. - The court is recessed into 9 AM tomorrow morning, when We will begin closing arguments. - This glass of water represents the lives of two women. Their lives were as clean as this water. This ink is the slayer's bullet which brought gloom and heartbreak to the very souls in this widow and her daughter. You have a responsibility to the state of Louisiana to protect it from people like Mrs. Henry. Do the right thing. Death is the only verdict and just punishment. GENTLEMAN: Hang her. COURTROOM OBSERVER: Yes. JUDGE: That's enough. I'll have the next person arrested. - It is our belief based on the evidence presented that our client should not be found guilty as charged, which in this case, means sentencing her to death. The direct testimony of who shot Mr. Galloway establishes it was not Mrs. Henry who pulled the trigger, but Finnon Burkes. It was Burkes who secured the murder weapon, and it was Burkes who drove the stolen car. There is no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Henry actually shot JP Calloway-- only circumstantial evidence. Gentlemen at the jury, you cannot sentence a woman to hang by the neck until dead based on circumstantial evidence. Now, in a few minutes, the judge will issue you possible verdicts in this case. We respectfully, respectfully ask that you return a verdict other than guilty as charged and spare the life of Toni Jo Henry. Well, that's it. - Gentlemen of the jury, we've given you the necessary elements to prove the crime of murder. Further, gentlemen, if you find that from the evidence provided in this case that this defendant conspired with another or others to commit a felony, and that during the course of that conspiracy, one of the conspirators, not the defendant, actually pulled the trigger that shot JP Galloway, then the defendant is just as guilty under the law as though she had pulled the trigger herself. Court will be in recess while the jury deliberates. JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise? Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have your honor. We find the defendant guilty as charged. [gasps] JUDGE: Quiet in the courtroom. Bailiff, please reman Mrs. Henry back to her cell. TONI: She was the only witness, some-- someone who unsuccessfully sought to have her tell something of her past life as an abused young girl and as a prostitute and a drug addict as influencing factors in the crime of which she stood accused. Seems real fair, don't it? - But you boys are asking for an appeal. And that's good. - She actually ask for me? She asked to speak to a priest? - Well, not in so many words. - What words did she use? I don't force myself or my face on anyone. - But that's why you're the perfect person to talk with her father. Father Richard. I don't know what to say to her. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen to this. Mr Copland's participation in the trial cannot be said to be favorable to the prosecution as he stated before the trial in the public press that he was employed by the deceased family to demand only a capital verdict. - And a high court senior shouldn't have been allowed to testify about your childhood. - Yeah. And they didn't like the fact that your so-called confessions weren't free and voluntary. It helped your uncle wasn't to be found. - Moss told me that the authorities are trying to get him to turn himself in. That can help me. - Yeah. Well, maybe at the next trial. But we'll be ready for him. - Wait. -(WHISPERING) Thank you so much for coming [inaudible]. - Toni Jo, this is the priest I've been telling you about. This is Father Richard. - Well, it's nice to meet you Father Richard. I never really talked to a priest before. - Well then, I hope I don't disappoint you. - I'd offer you a place to sit, but uh, we'd kind of full here. - No, we've got to be on our way, so take ours. - Nice to meet you Father Richard. I'm Clement Moss. - Clement. This is my partner, Norman Anderson. - Norman. - Well, I didn't intend to scare you fellas off. - Oh, don't worry Father. They don't scare that easy. - I gotta get home. Really looking forward to finally having a home cooked meal. - Have a nice visit. - Have a nice visit. - Bring me back some leftovers. Food stinks around here. [laughs] Well, I guess you're waiting to hear my sob story. I never really been that big on confession. - Truthfully, neither have I. - You ain't a typical priest, are you? - Typical has never been a goal of mine. - Good. Because I don't really go for them firing brimstone preachers. - Thank you. To quench the fire? I would just like to be your friend. - But I'm a criminal. - Some people thought Jesus was a criminal too. - Right. Just don't try any of that converting stuff on me. I had enough religion to last me a lifetime, no matter how short it may be. - How can you befriend a woman like that? She murdered a man in cold blood. - Well, you must know more than the courts then. Because they're in the process of trying to figure that out. - What I do know is that cold hearted woman needs to pay for what she's done. - You are not describing the woman I have come to know these past few months. - You expect me to swallow that? - No. If I can arrange it, would you like the opportunity to speak with that cold hearted woman face to face? - You bet. - Wait here. - I've never met a person accused of murder. So while I've covered the trial of Annie Beatrice Henry, since the beginning, I was reluctant to actually meet her face to face. Yellow bellied is more like it. You know, I smiled at that fellow twice. I'd say a lot of talent's gone to waste. - He couldn't believe your cell was unlocked. He was shaking in his boots. - Toni Jo, as she refers to herself, has been in jail for six months. She's currently awaiting her second trial. I found her to be very pleasant, unlike her image thus far. She maintains her innocence and firing the bullet, but she does take responsibility for her part in the crime. Mrs. Henry claims she's not unlike any other woman in love with her husband, and that's what drove her to make some bad decisions. - Toni Jo joked about her need for a sewing machine to make some new clothes when I commented on her appearance and how much coverage it's getting. It's difficult for this reluctant reporter to believe that this woman deserves to die. Punishment, yes. Death, no. Coral, I've got an idea. Does that old sewing machine downstairs still work? - Oh, no, no, no. Over there. Be careful with that. - Holy smoke. It's a good thing we had that other cell to put all this stuff in, huh? [gasps] -(WHISPERING) [inaudible]. [laughs] -It's about time them press buzzards started turning around public opinion. - One Gibbs. Let's not get carried away. - How are they just one? - She says it's for-- she said it's for you to buy material to sew some new clothes. I'd like to write you. And in my next letter, I will include funds for your legal expenses. How much does that make? - Well, all told, I ain't exactly sure. But this Week, it's at least $40. - No skimming Gibbs. [MUSIC BILLIE HOLIDAY, "SOLITUDE"] [gasp] - You're not wearing that in court. - Oh boy. - Wait 'til my papa gets a load of this. Or better yet, Wait 'til Mr. Copeland lays his eyes on me. I need a full length mirror in here. - Copeland can't try this case again, but the district attorney, Patterson, remains the same. Oh, and no new judge. We'll face Hood again. - You boys are just full of good news. - Mm, mm, mm. Any which way you shoot yourself in the foot, you wear that thing. - Yeah. And you wear that thing in court, the press will have a field day. - Oh, let them. What's the difference? - Be smart Toni Jo. - Because Patterson's smart. - Yeah. [inaudible] want the right to have Finnon Burkes as a witness. - And Judge Hood is not allowed to our objections to Burkes's testimony. - Well, like I said, what's the difference? - Get a load of this. It's from Burkes. Basically, he's offered to take full blame for the murder if Toni Jo will help him escape from jail. - Let me see that. This is perfect. This is just what we need. [sighs] -It's about time I caught a brake. - God is good. - We have a month to prepare for any objections to his admission. - No sir, not this month. - Better uh, better get over to the church. - Yeah. - Looks like we're going to war. - I'm a get home. I'll take this with me. - I'll call the judge and see how this affects our court date. - See you later Toni Jo. - See you Toni Jo. TONI (VOICEOVER): Dear love, my lawyers think my trial will take place the first part of next year, what with the war and all. I just wish you could come see me. My place looks real good. Father Richard's been here a lot. He's starting to make sense to me. But don't Worry. I'm not ready to become a nun yet, ha, ha. Wish me luck on the next trial. I love you, Toni Jo. - Prosecution may call its next witness. - State your name and occupation for the record. - My name is George McQuiston, and I'm currently on leave from Louisiana State Police, where I hold the rank of captain. - Mr. McQuiston, has anybody told you not come to this courtroom? - No sir. - Has anybody tried to prevent you from coming to this courtroom? - No sir. - Then I hereby find you in contempt of court. And immediately following your testimony, you will be arrested and remanded to the custody of Sheriff Reid. Is that understood? - Yes your honor. - Mr. McQuiston, you did not testify at Mrs. Henry's first trial. Is that correct? - That is correct. - Would you like to tell us why? - Well, Annie B. Is my niece, and um, she's had a pretty hard life. -Isn't it your duty as a representative of the state police to testify to the truth of a criminal matter, even if the person is a relative? - Yes sir. It's Why I turned myself in. - You heard your sister, Mrs. Holt, testify in this trial that she called you about the defendant, Mrs. Henry. - Yes sir. PROSECUTOR: Could you tell the court what happens when you arrived at her house? - Well, Emma was, she was upset. And um, I told her to sit tight and that I'd be there directly. Annie B., I want you to tell me exactly what happened. -It's like I didn't know what I was doing, like I was crazed. - Listen, I want to help you out. And I'm going to, but you're going to have to tell me the truth. - We needed his car. We was going to rob a bank for the money. - You then handed her over to Sheriff Reid? MR. MCQUISTON: Yes sir. - No further questions. - Mr. McQuiston, I'm interested in exactly what you promised your niece in return for her-- PROSECUTOR: Objection. - Sustained. - Your honor, I believe George McQuiston has already testified that he'd help her. - The objection is sustained Mr. Moss. Sit down. - O K. Why'd Miss Henry tell you she shot Mr. Galloway? MR. MCQUISTON: Because she wanted his car. - No, that's not what I mean. I mean, Why do you think she was so willing to discuss this with you? - I couldn't say. - Wasn't it because you and your sister promised her you'd help her? - Objection. Your honor-- - Sustained. There'll be no further questions regarding what may or may not have been promised to the defendant. Does that mean you have no further questions for the Witness? - Well, obviously, if every time I try to ask a question you forbid it-- - Watch it Mr. Anderson, or I'll hold you in contempt of court, and you'll find yourself spending the night in jail. - No further questions your honor. - Next witness. - The state calls Horace Finnon Burkes to the stand. [chatter] JUDGE: I will have order in this courtroom, or I will clear the courtroom. - Stand up please. Raise your right hand. Put the other on the bible. Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? ARKIE: I do. BAILIFF: Have a seat. PROSECUTOR: State your name for the record. ARKIE: Horace Finnon Burkes. - You also go by the name Arkie? - Yeah. My friends call me Arkie. I don't mean Yorkie. [laughter] - Mr. Burkes, you've already been sentenced to die for the murder of Joseph P. Galloway. Is that correct? - Yes sir. - So you have nothing to gain by your testimony here today? - Objection your honor. - Overruled. You may answer the question. - No sir. Nothing to gain. - Tell us what happened when you got picked up by Mr. Galloway. - Well, We did hitchhike. We were given a ride by Mr. Galloway. Toni Jo had the only gun with bullets. She wanted to put him in the turtle back to keep him quiet. - That's-- that's a lie! - Counsel, if you can't keep your client quiet, I will. Continue, Mr. Burkes. - I did slam his hand in the turtleback, but it was an accident. - Go on. - After we were driving for a while, Toni Jo wanted me to pull off the road because of his hollerin' on account of his cut hand. PROSECUTOR: You pulled off the road? - Yep. And she wanted him to strip. - Son of a bitch is lying. - I will not have any further antics from the defendant. Is that clear? - Yes your honor. PROSECUTOR: Continue. - After he undressed, we walked him behind these rice stacks. Toni Jo told me to take his clothes back to the car. [gun shot] - Toni Jo, what'd you do? - Just shut up Arkie. It's none of your damn business. Get back to the car. - Did you kill him Toni Jo? - Pick up the clothes. Come on! Pick up the clothes! Let's go! - You killed him Toni Jo! Why? TONI: Shut up Arkie! PROSECUTOR: Where did you drive to? - I told her we should go to Arkansas to rob a bank. - What happened? - Bank was gone. [laughing] She was sore. [crowd laughing] - I knew there was no bank there. I just wanted to get as close to my home as I could. - So what did you do next? - I told her we'd find a place to hide out for a bit and then go on to another town. TONI: I thought we said there was a bank we could rob in this town. ARKIE: There used to be. How was I to know it was dried up? - Well, now what are we going to do? - We'll find another one. - Well, thanks to you, we don't hardly have any money left. - Yeah. L-- I'm going to get me something to drink with that money. - Not now Arkie. We've got to think. - I think we need bullets for the guns. I should go out and get some. - That's the first good idea you've had in a long time. - Where's that fella's money? - Here. Trade that for bullets. Arkie. Don't double cross me. PROSECUTOR: So you were afraid for your life? - I was afraid she'd do me like she did that Mr. Galloway. - No further questions your honor. - The defense may question the witness. - Well, I could certainly see how such a big man will be intimidated by such an imposing accomplice. - Objection. - I apologize. I apologize, I apologize, I apologize. I withdraw the comment. - Watch the sarcasm Mr. Anderson. - Yes your honor. Arkie, after you were convicted and sentenced to death for killing Mr. Galloway, weren't you hoping for another trial? - Yes. But it was denied. - Arkie, did you recently send Miss Henry a letter? PROSECUTOR: Objection. - Your honor, this letter was sent to Miss Henry by Mr. Burkes, and I feel it is relevant to this case. - Let me see the letter Mr. Anderson. I'll allow it. Objection overruled. - Thank you. Arkie, did you recently send Miss Henry a letter promising her that you would shoulder the entire blame for the killing if she would help you with a possible jailbreak? - I just wanted to see what she'd say. CLEMENT: Just to be clear, is that a yes? - Yes. -Isn't it true Arkie that you did in fact fire a fatal shot to Mr. Galloway? - No sir. CLEMENT: You know how to fire a gun? - Yeah sir. I was in the army. - Oh, you were in the army? They teach you how to fire a weapon? - Yes sir. - Wasn't it the business of the United States army to teach all their good soldiers to fire their weapons accurately? - They Try- - Is that a yes? - Yes. - So after you were instructed in how to fire your weapon with deadly accuracy, isn't it true you deserted the army of the United States? - Yes. But I was going to turn myself in. - Yeah, I'm sure. It was a yes, wasn't it? - Yes. - Weren't you convicted and served time in Huntsville, Texas for armed robbery Arkie? - Yes sir. - Thank you. No further questions your honor. - Uh, your honor, I'd like to redirect a question to the witness. - Go ahead Mr. Patterson. - What was your purpose in writing to Mrs. Henry? - I knew she'd lie about who fired the gun. I figured she'd have a better chance getting off, being a good looking woman and all. Then she could help me escape. - Another well thought out plan. Thank you Mr. Burkes. No more questions. Your honor, the prosecution rests. - The jury's back. We need y'all back in the courtroom. -[inaudible] an hour. - Is it good or bad? - What's with the bag? The archdiocese send you with a poisonous snake for my cell? - The orders are orders you know. - It needs to be quicker. - You ready? OK. [gasp] - Oh my god! What a sweet little boy you are! - Well then, you'd better look again. [gasp] - Oh. Well, then I'll, I'll call you Jezebel in honor of you and your religion. But I'll go by Bell. - Mhm. - Aw. - Oh. -It's been a long time since someone's done something so nice for me. - And I'm glad I could. - You restored my faith. - Well, I have been waiting a while to hear those words. - In mankind Father, not god. - Don't you know? That is how God loves you, through people like me. - So that's how he's shown his love for me for the first 20 years of my life? Through all the wonderful people who have guided, and nurtured, and loved me? - Nothing goes unnoticed, and that includes you, and the injustices in your life. He's just waiting for you to reach out to him. He'll do the rest. Remember when I brought that reporter fellow here, and you nearly cussed out a man of the cloth? - Don't you just hate "I told you" so's? [laughs] - No. You received I don't know, more than $120. So far. - Well, that's not very specific for an accountant. Besides, not all of them letters have been sugar. - Some people know the Lord's compassion, and some don't. - What are you working on Toni Jo? - My execution dress. - They're talking about an electric chair. - I'm having a hard time facing her. - May I read you something? - No more bad news, please. - This is a bit of good news. The teachers of the law brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, if any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her. Again, he stooped down and wrote on the ground that this, those who heard, began to go away. Jesus straightened up and asked her, woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? No one sir, she said. Than neither do I condemn you, declared Jesus. Go now and leave your life of sin. - What was he writing on the ground? - No one really knows. - The holy roller's killed some, right? - Mercy is hard to come by. Jesus was wrongfully charged and wrongfully put to death. And still, he is willing to die for our offenses. Only he can give you what you need. - Stop right there cowboy. - The bastards owe us a phone call. I'm working on another plan baby. - So this is the good part. It'll be a long time before you see those pearly gates. They can't do this to you. Anyways, you'll always be my pearl in the rough. [laughs] I think he means diamond in the rough. - Well, either way, he got the rough part of it. We'll see what I can do about that phone call. -(WHISPERS) Thank you. - O K. Well, what questions do you have for me this week? - O K. Well, the last thing I have is the vast mysteries of the universe should only confirm our belief and the certainty of its creator. - I thought we'd moved on from that. - Don't want to talk about Darwin, eh father? - Absolutely. God gave you a mind to question, and that is how you obtain true faith. - So you think I need to get dunked? - We don't dunk. We sprinkle. And yes. - O K. Well, let's do it quick then before I change my mind. -It's not like taking castor oil Toni Jo. It's, it's an opportunity for a new life. - I do believe father. I need to believe. Help me. - Do you think they'll let you out here for about an hour tomorrow? [music playing - hymn] - No more trial misgate. No more robbing banks, and no more hurting people baby. TONI (ON PHONE): (WHISPERING) Please be good. - I can't listen to this. You know I can't stand to hear you cry. But I sure as hell can't accept not seeing you again. - It was my last request to talk to you, so please tell me what I need to hear. - O K. TONI (ON PHONE): I was selfish. I always felt so alone. [inaudible] did to you cowboy. And I always hoped that there was a god running the show. And I just wished maybe I could, just maybe I could still just one more act with you. Just one little act. Put your faith in god. Live a law-abiding life. - I'll be good sweetheart. - And you never, whatever you do, you never walk out that back door again. You behave like a man and make your momma and me proud. And you always walk out that front door. You hear me love? (WHISPERING) Well, I've got to go now. I love you forever. - I love you too Toni Jo. [sobbing] - Father? Would you step out for a minute? - Why? Why-- why's he got to leave? -It's only for a couple of minutes Toni Jo. He can come back. TONI: (SCREAMING) No! [inaudible] [crying] That was not right! It was supposed to be hanging! - Father, I need you back in there. They're going to cut off all her hair for the cap mask. TONI: Get away from me! -(WHISPERING) on god. TONI: Father Richard! [crying] - I want my other father. It's all I have left, and they want to take it. It's all I have left. - Oh god. Toni Jo. Annie B. Look at me. You are more than your hair. You are more than your looks. And you are braver than anyone in this room. You have been such a bright and colorful spot in my life. And because you're a bright and colorful person, you're unique, and you have worth. And no one can take that from you. You can do this. You can do this, because I won't leave your side, not even for one minute before you leave this world for the glory that awaits you. - Then can I have my hair back? -(WHISPERING) Of course. What would an angel be without her glorious hair? [sniffling] - He stays. - No problem. FATHER RICHARD: You just close your eyes and listen to my words, words of truth. Humble yourselves therefore, under God's mighty hand so that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. What benefit did you reap at that time when you were slaves to sin for the things that you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death. But thanks be to God, you have been set free from sin, and have become slaves to God. The benefit you reap leads to holiness. And the result is eternal life. Bless the Lord with all my soul. Bless his holy [inaudible]. Bless the lord with all my soul. Forget not all he has given. Bless [inaudible] and all that is within. Bless the lord, [inaudible], who redeem in thy love and [inaudible]. And the saying that is written will come true. Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, o death, is your victory? Where, o death, is your [inaudible]? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not Want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I Walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou annointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. - Father? I know what Jesus was writing in the sand. He was writing my name, Annie Beatrice McQuiston or Toni Jo Henry. I guess it took him so long for all the bad things I'd done in my life. And I had too many names. -(WHISPERING) That's right Toni Jo. And it says pardoned next to all of them. - You sure Jesus will take the rap for me? Guaranteed - Any last words? [electrocution sounds]
