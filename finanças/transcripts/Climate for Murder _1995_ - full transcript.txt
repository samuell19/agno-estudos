(Multicom Jingle) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] It's four a.m. in downtown Montreal. 23 year old Joe Rose gets on the night bus after working late at a bar. He's on his way home. (dramatic music) As the bus leaves downtown, four teenagers taunt Rose because he has pink hair. One pulls off his hat. Rose starts to get off the bus but the driver tells him to stay on, saying it's safer. The teens continue harassing Rose. (dramatic music) At the end of the line, Rose tries to get off but the teens surround him. They punch and kick him. The 16 year old stabs him in the back, puncturing his heart with a six inch knife. Joe Rose bleeds to death on the bus floor. (dramatic music) The slaying of a gay man on a public bus stuns Montreal. It's a sign of things to come. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) 57 year old hospital worker, Harry Dolan, is found stabbed to death in his Montreal apartment. The body is discovered by his skinhead neighbor, Annai Nelson. (speaking in foreign language) Harry Dolan died from stab wounds to the neck and chest. (speaking in foreign language) Police suspect Nelson and bring him in for questioning but his fingerprints don't match those at the scene of the crime. - I don't want take my fingerprint. Police told me, I wring his neck. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] Harry Dolan's murder remains unsolved. Joe Rose is the first victim and Harry Dolan the latest in a string of 17 gay killings that shock Montreal. Most of the murders revolve around a half mile stretch that's known as the Gay Village, home to an estimated 20,000 gays and lesbians. It's a diverse area where bars, restaurants and shops thrive. But it has a dark side. It's one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, a no man's land of street kids and prostitutes. (dramatic music) The village is an oasis of freedom for gays but also an easy target for those who hate them. Police blame the string of murders on a series of violent robberies. Some murders involve cocaine. Others, male prostitutes. Some say a serial killer is stalking gay men. Still, others implicate neo-Nazi skinheads. As 10 of the 17 murders remain unsolved, fear escalates within the gay community. - In Montreal you really have this basic area where it's closed in and this is called the Gay Village and this is where some white powers come here at three o'clock in the morning with baseball bats and a car and just get out of the car, beat the shit out of one and then they just take off. - I usually carry a whistle. - There were 10 or 12 of them getting out of van with baseball bats and hitting, you know? They had a lot of fun. - I met some policemen around back at 410 and they told me, "tell your people "not to go there by night, it's dangerous." I answered him "tell your guys to go there more often "because it's dangerous." - I personally found the murders so shocking and so surprising because this city seems so completely tolerant that it's very amazing to hear of these 14 or 15 gay men killed. (mumbles) was also deeply shocking and unnerving. It's such a tolerant place, Montreal, that I find those murders particularly out of place. (sirens blaring) - [Narrator] The same day Joe Rose is murdered, 28 year old Richad Galan is found in the Gay Village, his throat slashed. Unsolved. 26 year old Laotian doctor, Edward Yong Sua Mok, bound and stabbed to death in his downtown high rise apartment. Unsolved. 46 year old sales rep, Gaetan Ethier. Beaten and stabbed to death in his St. Andre flat. Superintendent Michele Pasquier finds the body. (speaking in foreign language) Unsolved. 59 year old retired school teacher, Robert Assaly, stabbed to death in his Nuns Island apartment. Unsolved. 44 year old businessman, Normand Gareau, beaten to death with a blunt object in his Sherbrooke Street apartment. Unsolved. 30 year old unemployed Garfield Walker, stabbed in the back in his rundown flat on Henri Julien Street. Neighbor Charles Upton believes there is a reason why murders like Walker's remain unsolved. - Because he was a transvestite, there's no way to trust trying to solve the murder. - [Narrator] In Montreal, the growing number of unsolved murders only fuel suspicions. - Homophobic person. - Homophobia. - Homophobia. - Homophobia. - Homophobics. (speaking in foreign language) - Fascism. - I don't know. - I don't think you need to have one person as a serial killer. I think what you create is a climate. - Then these particular crimes may be unrelated in terms of the perpetrators, but the phenomenon is the same. - Homophobia. - I think it's an issue of hit motivated violence. - It's also maybe has something to do with poverty. He's frustrated with his own situation and his own life and he has to take it out on someone. - Young people that are sick. - Punk looking like extra right-wing neo-Nazi looking skinheads, yeah, skinheads. - The chances of a thorough investigation over the murder of a gay man is pretty unlikely. - It's a strange psycho case. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] Gay activists are convinced the serial killer is stalking gay men. - 13 in three years. Where's the public outcry? If this was 13 little teenage girls, head would be rolling. - [Narrator] Police investigate. - Everybody came and everybody was saying that there was a serial killer. There is no serial killer. - The one comment I will make about the Montreal case is that the cases I looked at, I found no connection. - [Narrator] Eventually police convince gay leaders by showing them case files. - You're saying now there's not a serial killer from what we have seen this morning, but there certainly is a series of murders and a phenomenon that has developed. - [Narrator] And that phenomenon is still out there. - I can say that when you have killed once or twice and I say that the probability that he will kill again. - [Narrator] If there is no serial killer, the alternative is worse; there are several killers. But who are the suspects? There are an estimated 250 skinheads in Montreal and five ultra right-wing skinhead gangs. Skinheads don't just hit on racial minorities, they also target gays. - Yeah, I was found right over there in that corner. I had tried to stand up at one point and I'd fallen down and hit my head on the corner of that beam there and through it all I ended up with a scar right from behind my ear all the way down the base of my neck. - [Man] They tried to slit your throat. - Yeah, their intention was to kill me. - (mumbles) In my mouth and on the bone-- - [Man] The bones in your face. - My eyes too and this eye, I can't see, just a little bit. - [Narrator] This skinhead was arrested in the summer of 1991 after a mob of 20 skins attacked the Gay Village in broad daylight. SHARP is an anti-racist skinhead group that monitors neo-Nazi activity on the street. There's plenty of it. - He was just waiting for me with a 12 inch blade and he just jumped me and cut my (mumbles) right open and cut it right down to the bone. - SHARP is Skin Heads Against Racial Prejudice, and anti-racist. We don't believe in that. Our biggest problems is that we're called Nazis every day of our life. Nine out of 10 skins in one show are racist. We know that racist skins bash homosexuals all the time. We know that they bash blacks and Pakistanis. You name it. - They go in the parks and they set one guy up as like a target guy and make him go and hit on a guy and bring him into the woods where there's like 10-15 boneheads waiting for him and when they get him into the woods, they beat the crap out of him. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Angrignon Park in Southwest Montreal. A skinhead lures 51 year old office worker, Yves Lalonde, into the woods for sex. Five more skinheads are waiting. They smash Lalonde with sticks, fracturing his skull, bursting his liver. They steal $92.00. Police catch up to the youths within days when one brags about beating a fag and makes plans to do it again. The leader is sentenced to three years, at the time the maximum under the Young Offenders Act. One of the arrested youths carries a card from an international neo-Nazi group, known to single out gays. 18 months later, someone has painted Nazi graffiti next to the spot where Yves Lalonde was killed. (dramatic music) The rise of Nazi gangs is not isolated. During the time of the murders, Montreal has also witnessed a general rise in youth violence. The number of teens charged for violent crimes has risen 20%. The numbers for assault, 60%. In this attack, six youths gang up. And skins aren't the only ones who beat up gays. The youths who killed Joe Rose weren't skinheads. One adult, Patrick Moyese, was sentenced to seven years for manslaughter. Police say more and more gangs are going after gays. - The years of '91, '92, '93, there were a little bit more gays assaulted, probably beaten and there were probably some violent gang that I'm able to say now that really beat or went after the gay because they did not like them and they kill them. - [Narrator] And police suspect violent youth gangs could be responsible for some of the other murders. (dramatic music) Parc Maisonneuve. 33 year old accountant, Marc Belleriv, is found lying in his own blood under a tree beside his bicycle. (dramatic music) His attacker stabbed him over 40 times and slashed his throat. Around the same time, at least three other men are attacked in the park, a known meeting place for gay men. (dramatic music) Jarry Park, 48 year old student, Pierre Yvon Croft, found near his bicycle, stabbed over 15 times. (dramatic music) Savagery of the Belleriv and Croft murders convince many that Montreal has a serious hate crime problem. (upbeat music) - Fear. - Fear. - It's alien to them. - Fear of the unknown. - I have no idea. - It all comes down to being afraid of something that's different. - My mother thought it was a disease. - I don't know why people are homophobic or whatever. - They do it because they are stupid. - Not that you're abnormal to be gay, but it's just that it's not the way it should be. - Intolerance and ignorance and not being aware and not being sensitive. - Discrimination is taught. - If a straight man is uncomfortable with himself, inside himself, well a gay person is going to bother him a lot. - If they come to me and oh you're nice, oh yeah bam! That's it. - Your ignorance causes you to have prejudices that are based on a lack of knowledge. - Because the AIDS factor. - We live in a culture that values masculinity and for men to think about the possibility of being attracted to a man is really scary. (speaking in foreign language) - You look at movies, like Silence of the Lambs, that was like a psycho killer fag. - I would encourage people to come out of the homosexual lifestyle and they can do that by finding God, by having a relationship with Him. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] For Pascal McDonald and his high school friends, gay bashing was practically a social event. (speaking in foreign language) They even brought along their girlfriends. Media reports say they bashed as many as 60 gay men until the night they killed someone. (speaking in foreign language) McDonald says they went out that night to party together. (speaking in foreign language) He and his friends stopped at the rest stop on the way to Joliette because they knew there were people there, that they were gay. So they stopped to watch them. (dramatic music) 37 year old teacher Daniel Lacombe stops at a rest stop bathroom. It's a known gay pick up spot, but Lacombe is not gay although the youths think he is. He refuses their advances. On the way back to his car, Patrick Paquette punches hm four times in the head. Lacombe collapses and Paquette jumps on his chest. The youths lift $15 and flee. (speaking in foreign language) Pascal McDonald serves just three months. Patrick Paquette gets four years and just the suspicion of being gay got Daniel Lacombe killed. Some say the killers of Joe Rose and Daniel Lacombe were just doing what was once sanctioned by the Canadian government. - In Canada, the penalty for sexual activity between two people of the same sex until 1855, was death. In fact the first execution in Canada was a man who was put to death for having sex with a man. Until 1955, there were severe terms of imprisonment with the lash if you were convicted of being involved in homosexual activity. And until 1969, it was illegal, and so we're in a context where within our culture it's not very far away that homosexuality was punished severely. - [Narrator] And others say the past still lives in Canadian censorship laws. - Canada is an anally retentive nation. - Descriptions and depictions of anal penetration are obscene in Canada and are not allowed in the country. What sexual acts are prohibited by Canadian customs. 1. Anal penetration. 2. Excessive ejaculation on a person's face defined as on the eyes, ears or nose however, the chin and forehead are federally protected. C. Group ejaculation. The state is saying that a male penetrating another male by definition is obscene. The message that's being sent to the public at large is that the predominant mode, or one predominant mode of gay sexual behavior is unacceptable, is obscene, is repulsive. Nothing to do with the anus is considered to be healthy sex. - [Narrator] The irony is that gay culture has become so popular, it's being celebrated in Montreal's heterosexual world. One of Montreal's hottest nightclub events, Squeeze, mixes gays and straights. The subculture has never been more vibrant or visible. Sadly, many believe gay visibility and growing mainstream acceptance also creates a backlash. - When mainstream press picks up on this, of course, it's yet another equation with equating the gay lifestyle with death, which we've already had ad nauseum because of AIDS. When people think of gay men now, so often they think of death, whether by AIDS or by this sort of very violent homophobic gay bashing. These people have been predicting for a time that there would be violent backlash against gays because of AIDS and since Joe was actually himself, somebody who had AIDS when he was murdered, I felt this was what we were witnessing was the beginning of a huge backlash against gay men and I was very upset by it. - [Narrator] If AIDS explains the backlash against gays, how do we explain violence against lesbians? - Most of my friends that got bashed, like lesbians, they've been followed walking out of a lesbian night or a lesbian bar. They just followed them and then wait til they find a little dark corner and beat the shit out of them. The states, the church, this coup, the family, push. Push very hard to maintain and reduce this ideology that heterosexuality is the basis of society. And I think that's why they just hate us. - As a movement pushes itself forward, you're always going to get a backlash. You're always going to get a sector of society that doesn't want you around. I think as long as we're not recognized by church and state as (speaking in foreign language), as equal to every other citizen in this country, as long as we don't have those equal rights, it'll feed upon people's prejudices against us. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The Anglican Church of St. James the Apostle. It's where 54 year old Warren Eling serves until November 10th, 1993. That night, he is found bound, naked and strangled. Montreal is rocked by the murder. The Reverend meets his killer on a street corner in the village. - The drama or the scene, the first encounter started here then we all know what happened after that. - [Narrator] Warren Eling's wallet, computer, and sound system are stolen. Danny McIlwaine is arrested December 10th, 1993, after he drinks antifreeze in a suicide attempt. McIlwaine tells the court he killed Eling accidentally, strangling him in an S&M ritual. The jury doesn't buy it. McIlwaine gets life in prison for first degree murder. But others pegged some of the responsibility for Eling's death on the church. - Warren was a friend and a priest. Warren and I had been in the same seminary 30 years ago in Toronto. Two years ago, a little over two years ago, we had a parish vacancy here in Montreal and I was very happy to have his name nominated and ultimately invited him here as priest of that parish. - [Narrator] In Toronto, Anglican priest Jim Ferry was fired for having a gay lover, creating a climate of fear for other gay priests. - Warren didn't leave Toronto just because of what happened to me. He was one of several factors. And I think homophobia figured largely in the whole thing. Warren was a very competent priest but he was obviously single and to many people, fairly obviously gay, although he was very causative. I think the church bears a great deal of responsibility for the death of Warren Eling. It's the church's duplicitous standards saying we love gays but we won't allow you to be in a loving relationship. That would not allow Father Eling to form a long term committed relationship. He had one for several years, he had to give it up. And I really have to ask the church, the bishops, just how things might have been different if instead Warren had been allowed to have a loving, committed relationship? - Committed lifelong relationships between same sex partners has not been part of the picture up to now that any intimacy between same sex partners would be seen as something outside marriage and outside what the church says is the ideal. - They say on the one hand no sex outside of marriage and then they turn around and say we won't bless your unions. Now there's a real contradiction there. - It's a terrible anomaly. It's a terrible anomaly at the moment and the day may well come when, and certainly is coming in the society as a whole, the day may well come even within the life of the church where committed, life long relationships between same sex partners are honored and accepted and even blessed. (thunder clapping) - [Narrator] Quebec is steeped in Catholic tradition. A church which says homosexuals are sinners. In 1993, Pope John Paul described homosexuality as an intrinsically evil act. The year before, the Vatican called discrimination against lesbians and gays, sometimes justifiable. 70 year old Catholic priest, Rolland Gagne, strangled to death in his downtown apartment. Police arrest two men, one of them just 17. The case is now before the courts. The Catholic church in Montreal remains silent about the priest's death. It's not the only institution that shows homosexuals' lack of understanding. (crowd yelling) Montreal gays gather outside Station 25 to protest police action during a brutal raid the night before at a party, the Sex Garage. (crowd yelling) Gays say police discrimination has prevented cops from solving the murders. (crowd yelling) Relations between the community and the police are marked by a history of tension dating back to the Sex Garage incident. (upbeat music) (crowd yelling) - The message that that sent out was not only that the police were too brutal like most people watching it would assume the police were overreacting, but for any homophobes who are violent, watching those broadcasts was clearly a sanction of a government institution sanctioning homophobic violence. (speaking in foreign language) (siren blaring) - In spite of all the prejudice, we're not welcome because the gay community like any other minor community has prejudice towards the police. Now we're keeping statistics about crimes that concern gay but there again we have problems because there's not many, and when, let's say-- - [Reporter] Not many reported. - Not many reported. That's very important to recite. Not many reported and when they are reported, if it's not obvious for us and if the victim does not say that he's gay, he cannot be concerned as a gay crime. And there's no way we can ask the person, that's because of Quebec law, are you gay? - [Narrator] The gay killings, the plague of gay bashing, the sense that the police in the province don't care enough to solve the murders. All this leads Quebec's human rights commission to hold historic public hearings on gay and lesbian rights. June 1st, 1994, the commission recommends police work with the gay and lesbian communities to solve crime. - The promise is still there, we can't solve a crime after one concentration or one week of public hearings. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] In its report, the Quebec Human Rights Commission points to Ottawa as a model for community policing. - First thing we're starting to use is the video. - Gay and lesbian activists say Ottawa police are on the leading edge and perhaps North America when it comes to dealing with gay bashing and hate crime. - [Narrator] Two years after a man is killed, in 1989, Ottawa police create an anti-hate crime squad, the Bias Crime Unit. - Well the individual was a waiter at the Château Laurier Hotel and he lived over in Hull and he walked home on a nightly basis and what he did was he cut through this park in the evening, again was frequented by gay men, to take the Interprovincial Bridge home and that night, as he was going through the park, there was a group of teenagers up there that were deciding that they were going to roll gay people. And he basically was perceived to be gay so he was targeted and he was surrounded and robbed, eventually dragged to the bridge and hung upside down which is about a 10 story drop, if anybody's ever seen that bridge, it's a metal bridge and it ends up down at the rocks in the Ottawa River. And again, it was very lighthearted and joking about it. The last thing they commented on before they dropped him was nice set of shoes you have there. They let him go and he fell to his death. - Up until this unit came about, I had no confidence telling anyone that they should call the police and report a bashing or report an issue of harassment. Now we at least have a focus where I can say to someone, call the Bias Crime Unit. I truly think that this unit, and the bias crime spin on things will truly be community policing in the year 2000 and years to come. Anybody is looking at placing (mumbles) has to realize that you cannot police people who don't want to be policed. - It's the creed that allows you to police. We're not staking out cans and stuff like that looking to catch people in sexual positions. I mean, my God. - [Narrator] Montreal gay activists demand cops move toward a similar style of policing. (dramatic music) Instead, Montreal Police raid K.O.X., the city's largest gay nightclub and arrest over 160 people. - Were effectively being performed openly sexual acts of masturbation, oral sex, things of that nature. - [Narrator] The following day, those caught up in the K.O.X. raid hold a press conference to denounce the arrests. - For Christ's sake, that means for me that I cannot go anymore in any gay bar because I could be arrested to be in a bounty house. - The raid situates itself in a series of events that have been going on for the last year and a half of trying to improve relations between the police department and the gay and lesbian community. And this kind of event unfortunately sets us back. - [Narrator] Many feel police should have talked with club owners instead of arresting over 160 people. - What I look at is society, the general population's reaction to this. If there's a raid on a heterosexual bar where sex is happening, then those people there are blamed and it's their illegal act, if it's illegal. Whereas last night at K.O.X., there were, in society's mind, the entire gay community was there and the entire gay community was having sex. - [Narrator] Gay activists say Montreal needs an organization police can consult to prevent situations like the K.O.X. affair and that organization needs money. - One of the ways is to get funding from the Minister of Public Security to be able to put together some kind of professional resources to be able to start answering these problems. - But who are we gonna give the public money to? Are they reliable? That's the problem. Credibility is built with years and that's their problem for the moment. - We started our best interests to be an adverse points between the police department and the communities, especially when we have 15 dead bodies. - [Narrator] By the end of '93, the death toll would reach 17. The highest number of recorded gay murders in Canada. - [Man] Probably because it's one of the most liberated cities in the world. - I mean, shit happens. - I think it's important to say that for most gay, lesbian and bisexual people, Montreal seems to be a very good place to live, a very open city, probably the most open city in North America. But I also believe that with increased visibility the community and the increased self-affirmation of the community, there's probably a reaction against that. - I've never had a problem in Montreal but I think it also is my stature. I look intimidating. - We have a population that in my view and others would contest this I suppose, is not as cosmopolitan in its history as people might tend to believe. - The fact that there is an identifiable village makes it easier to correlate someone's sexual orientation to that of a murder. - I don't think we should single out Montreal. I think it ends up a victim of that kind of violence everywhere for a long period of time. - Times are hard whether the solutions are economic or political, you have to find victims so we have many Jews to bash in Montreal but we have these nice gay people in the same district, so, I'm being cynical but... (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Police and gay activists have conducted intensive investigations. But the one thing they haven't done is publicly examined the link between the murders and Montreal's street cocaine trade. (dramatic music) Montreal anti-poverty groups say there are as many as 5,000 street kids in the city. (dramatic music) Many turn to hard street drugs and then to prostitution to support their addictions. During the same time period as the Montreal killings, gay murder epidemics have also struck New York and Washington, cities with visible gay communities. Cities that are also plagued by poverty, prostitution, cocaine. It's an explosive mix. This is the corner of Champlain and Sainte Catherine. The dark side of the Gay Village. A kind of no-mans land on the border between the up and coming Gay Village and Montreal's poor, Southeast end. Champlain and Sainte Catherine is a center for male prostitution in Montreal. It's also a major new hotspot for cocaine. The needle exchange recently opened one block away. It's filled with prostitutes who buy cocaine in the area and sell sex to finance their habit. Surprisingly, many of the male prostitutes on the strip aren't gay. This prostitute is a self described heterosexual. He says he hates the sex but hustles to support his cocaine habit. It's a typical story on the strip. It's the story behind many of the gay murders. Warren Eling met his murderer two blocks from here. - On the corner of Sainte Catherine and Plessis. - [Narrator] Danny McIlwaine was straight. A married man, a cocaine addict who says he hustles to support his habit. Brian Booth's murder was similar. He was killed in a downtown hotel room but his killers picked him up at Club David. A known hustler bar one block from Champlain and Sainte Catherine. Police have since closed it down. Police evidence suggest Gaetan Ethie met his murderer at a bar called Le Top, also at the corners of Sainte Catherine and Champlain. Yet another murder victim, Michael Hogue was killed in his home in early 1993 by a heterosexual prostitute who hustled in exchange for cocaine. And murder victim Nomo Gavo was himself a cocaine dealer according to police. This man says he worked for him. (speaking in foreign language) - Perhaps a turn, don't know, a turn or (mumbles) really (mumbles) the crime. That mean that the guy who killed the other guy, killed him because he was gay. But most of the crimes were just criminals. For money or for the kick. - I would say setting up 40 year old people or getting picked up by 40 year old people average and being driven home. Sometimes they have the knife on them, sometimes they don't. And sometimes they go into this sexual act and when the person is in the position he does not see him, they stab or they punch and they kill. - [Narrator] Is the solution to these in most of the 10 unsolved murders, found in the drugs and prostitution that revolve around the corner of Champlain and Sainte Catherine? That connection explains a lot about the murders. All the murders were accessibly violent. - Cocaine, heroin. I'm not an expert but I can tell you anything that we have that involves drugs, heroin or cocaine, it's violent, it's very violent. There's no mercy. - [Narrator] Most victims were over 40, the strip is full of older men seeing sex, often closeted, easy prey for would-be killers. - We were even told by the gay community when we met them last Monday, that once you're over 32, 33 in the gay community, you're past tense. So if you're looking 35, you're not gonna pick up anymore with the young boys. You gotta go with the prostitutes. - That's not true, not at all. There's a lot of de-association in the clubs where any guy can go and find somebody you will like to love. The problem is they're afraid to be recognized, it will go by night, it will go in dark place in little street and in park. - [Narrator] The amount stolen in all cases were small. - All crimes committed are by people on this habit. Within minutes of following their crime, they're at the shooting gallery doing it. Which means that they're spontaneous. - [Narrator] Prostitutes themselves admitted the killer or killers could be in their midst. - He might be picking them up down here but he's not a regular person from here. He just comes down when he feels like picking someone up for his next victim. - He comes around here, he knows the area, he knows, he must have some kind of experience. - I don't want to put all the pressure on the victim, but some of those guys are criminal and they should be put in jail and stay there. If I was a police man, I would do undercover on the Sainte Catherine Street, let's see, Champlain, it's hard to tell, making friends with the prostitutes and that's the best way. When you know them, then you know, their habit, you know who are drug addicts, who can kill. - [Narrator] Montreal has developed a reputation of a dangerous place for homosexuals but gays have no reason to distrust each other because homosexuality is not the killer. Homosexuals are the victims. Still, 10 of the 17 murders remain unsolved. Who is to blame? There's no evidence of a serial killer. There is a series of killings with similar ingredients. Against a backdrop of growing Montreal poverty, a highly profitable cocaine trade thrives and the fringes of the Gay Village, some addicts are prostitutes who may steal and even kill to keep ahead of their habits. Society discourages open relationships between gays. This pushes some gay men into clandestine sex, sometimes found on dangerous streets at a deadly price. Laws and public attitudes marginalize gays. This makes them a convenient target for youth gangs, neo-Nazi skinheads and others who get a kick out of bashing gays and also muffles public outrage. Montreal police solve 80% of all homicides but have only solved 40% of the gay murders. Do police know or care enough about gay men? These are the factors that have created a climate for murder in Montreal and several killers have taken advantage of it. They have singled out gay men because they believe they have a better chance at getting away with murder. And so far, most of them have. (gentle music) - I'm gonna be 26 and have a baby son. And if I have a boy well he's gonna carry his name. With pride. (gentle music) - Why are people gay? Why are people heterosexual? - Why are people gay? That's a good question. - I don't know, do you know? - They're born that way? - They're born that way. - They're just born that way. - I don't think they're born gay. - Better gay than grumpy. - It's a profoundly religious question. - 'Cause baby without us, you ain't got nothing. - 'Cause it's fabulous. - Is it something that a young man learns from an overbearing mother? - I don't believe it's caused by being a mother overprotective or a father this. - As far as general medicine's concerned, they believe it's genetic. - Nature and nurture. - I guess it's nature. - If it is you and it's part of you, so be it. - It's something you're born with. It's not something we choose. - [Man] I'm sorry? - [Woman] Why? - That I don't know. - But certainly being gay is part of the normal, diversity of human existence.
