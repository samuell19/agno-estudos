Do I know you from somewhere? Because you look very familiar to me. Mmm, I don't think so. What's your name? Marty. Sonny. Marty, Sonny. Sonny, this is Marty. Hi. Go ahead. Yeah, Marty was at Shortly. She was a couple years behind us. Yeah, I went to Shortly, too. But I don't think we actually met. But then we wouldn't have, You being a big rod and all. Isn't that what they called you golden boys? Oh, well, you know, that was high school. And college, too. Depauw, wasn't it? Football star, big man on campus, B.M.O.C. So, you went, uh... You went back east to college? Uh-huh. And I'm going to go back and live there. Really? Uh, when? Oh, when I serve my time here. Well, daddy would let me go now. But mother thinks if I stay here, I'll meet a nice Jewish boy at the country club, get married, and grow up to bejust like her. So, I'm taking courses at Harrod and painting. If I can hack it for a year, I get my freedom. Ayear from now, I'll be gone. Where are you going? Well, New York, of course. Sure. - Sure. - Yeah, I mean, you know. Is there any place else? No, absolutely not. No, I meant what part of New York? You know, I actually, uh... Well, I may be heading there myself, as a matter of fact, to do some studying on the G.I. Bill. Oh. What would you study? Well, you know... philosophy maybe. Philos... Philosophy. Or, uh... Well, or... art. Art, yeah. You know, I figure art. Probably something, you know, something to do with, you know, art. Art. Well, I've got to run. Oh, thanks for the coffee. Did she leave? Marty. Hold on a second. Hold on there for a second. Listen, I was, uh... Well, I was thinking maybe, you know, we could get together sometime, you know. 'Cause, uh... Because I... I want to talk to you about some stuff. You know, I was thinking we could get together... and talk about some, uh... some... stuff. Like what? Well, uh... OK, would you at least give me your phone number? It's in the book. You all right? Did you twist your ankle? No, my ankle's fine. I just got such a goddamn hard-on, I can barely walk. Yeah, she's... I don't even know what she is. She's something else. She just thinks I'm a dumb jock. Oh, no, really? You think? Why don't you tell her about zen and that stuff? You know, take her to see some art. I don't know shit about art, OK? Oh, really, really, you do. You know, you look like you do. You know how to stand and... What happened to us? I thought we came down here to improve our minds, right? We were going to see some real art. Wasn't that the idea? I guess even art leads to pussy. I guess. Come on, man, let's go. Sonny, I want you to meet... a wonderful man. Happy to meet you, son. I'm Luke Matthews. Mr. Matthews wrote a book. Well, I'm going to leave you two alone... for a little while. I've got to run. "Matthews is a pseudonym... for a hardened convict... who found god on a prison rock pile." Mr. Matthews, I believe there's been a misunderstanding. What's that? That is my mother. Your mother understands that you were troubled, and she wishes to help you. My mother does not understand... that I'm sick of hearing about God. I don't believe in God. And frankly, I don't even like the guy. Well, you can't dislike something... or somebody that doesn't exist, can you? Mr. Matthews, I think I just need to... I need to figure some things out for myself. Yes, but at your age, you need to be watchful. We can come under the influence of magnetic people, and not realize they may walk in evil ways... and take others with them on the downward path. Are you talking about Gunner Casselman? Is that who you're talking about? Because... Is that right? Because if you're talking about Gunner Casselman, he happens to be a good friend of mine. He's great. He's a good friend. And I believe I'm at an age now, sir, where I can begin to pick my own friends. And frankly, if I want to hang out with Lucky Lucciano, I will, sir. The ways of evil may seem glamorous at first, until you view them from inside prison bars as I have. Mr. Matthews, I'm really glad that you're out on bail... parole. You did your time or whatever. But I think I need to lead my own damn life. You're at a turning point, son. Then I'll make the goddamn turn myself. - Yeah, so I'm trying to snow her, right? With a bunch of intellectual shit. Right, right. And she keeps shooting me down, you know? And every once in a while, she's yawning, OK? Ha ha ha ha! And she's really pissing me off. Finally she makes this crack... about how boring people are in the Midwest. I just flipped my lid right there. I couldn't take it anymore. I just said exactly what I thought, not giving a shit if she liked it or not. Absolutely. What'd you say? What'd you say? I just looked right at her and I said, "Hey, look, bitch, maybe I didn't go to school back east, OK? And I'm no egghead. And maybe I am just a dumb jock. But I know a few things... you don't know. Like I know how to fuck you. And I know you want it too." Yeah, so what... What did she say? She was jelly. Jelly. Oh, goddamn it! Is this in the Jewish style? What? Well, I'm not really familiar... with this style of painting. So, I naturally assumed... that since you're taking lessons... from that little Jewish girl... You know what, Mother? You don't have to keep saying Jewish all the time. You can just call her Marty. That's her name. Does it bother you that she's Jewish? No, Mother. It bothers you. Are you accusing Nina of prejudice? I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I should probably... I'll just... You know, I never made a peep... when you took out those little Jewesses... in high school. I'm as broad-minded as the next person. But this is a different story now. Why is that? Because you are a man now. You are at an age... when any girl might be a potential wife. And you know that! Don't you play dumb with me! I'm not. You're not going to marry her? No, I'm not playing dumb. You are going to marry her? That's what you're saying? You are telling me... that you intend to marry a Jewish girl? What if I am? Don't you know what it means... to marry a Jewish girl? Don't you know what they have to do before the wedding? No, what? The father, the night before the wedding, he does it with his own daughter. It's part of the Jew religion. They... they... they make them do that. Mother, where did you hear that? How did you come by that little nugget? It's common knowledge! Oh, God! The thing to do is just concentrate on your art, right? Forget all the bullshit. Yeah. Fucking "A." Just concentrate on your art. Oh, Sonny. You're terrific. You really do know about art. Oh, you're the art, baby. Did you forget the camp pine tree pledge? A pine tree man never ever betrays another camper. "And it came to pass... when Onan went in unto his brother's wife, and had spilled his seed upon the ground." Genesis 38, verses 4 through 10. "And the Lord slew Onan... when he spilled his seed." My poor boy, now you must be strong. Stay strong. Oh, Lord, would you look down upon this... this fine young man... in his time of trouble... and help him, help him to learn the way? The true way. Mr. Matthews? Yes, son? I was just wondering... why the hell you're in my room. Your mother has offered me... the hospitality of your home. And I'm just here... to do whatever it is you need. OK, son? Well, good night. Good night. What are you doing? I'm just throwing away... some old kids games. Oh, Sonny. This might be something you ought to save... for your own kids. I don't have any kids, Mother.

Well, they send you this test in the mail, right? And in one part of it... you're supposed to draw a picture of yourself. So, I drew a picture of me, you know, casual, drink in one hand, other hand in the pocket. The psychiatrist who graded the test said... it showed a tendency toward alcoholism and masturbation.
