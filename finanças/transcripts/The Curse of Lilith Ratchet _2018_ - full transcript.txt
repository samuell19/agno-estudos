I'm sorry that we're showing up so unannounced. Let's cut to the point. I've got something I think you're gonna wanna see. Come on in. DYLAN: Here we go. Help yourself. No, thanks. DYLAN: All right. Lauren and I are huge fans. We listen to every show. LAUREN: Mm-hm. That's awesome, that's great, I really appreciate it, you guys. Thank you, it means a lot. I mean, I'm totally flattered. Uh, do you guys have something you wanted to show me, or? Oh, yeah, um, we actually found this at an estate sale today. It was some rich old doctor. Guess he collected stuff like that. We thought you might be interested. You found a shrunken head at an estate sale. Crazy, right? Read the poem. (HAUNTING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Lilith Ratchet took a hatchet and granted her lover a head in a basket. Just play the game and call her name, and one by one, you'll feel her pain. It's like a nursery rhyme or somethin'. Man, did you read this? No offense, dude, but this sort of thing is not my forte, so just along for the ride. Hm. What are you doing? I'm gonna see if there's anything more to this Lilith Ratchet. Well, maybe there's something to this after all. It says, in the late 19th century on the east coast of Maine, Henry and Lilith Ratchet had one son. According to legend, the boy was killed in a horse and buggy accident when he was six years old, and Lilith was ultimately held responsible. Henry's affections towards her grew cold, and it wasn't long before all hope was lost when he began courting the town baker. Lilith's heart turned black, and she took to the dark arts in hopes of one day finding her true love. With the help of two local occultists, Lilith set out to make things right. To carry out her indecent intentions, Lilith had to decollate someone who had broken her heart and destroy the life of someone who had betrayed her. Her spell would be completed once her current state of existence ended, allowing Lilith to be reborn into the life of eternal, twisted bliss she recklessly desired. Fueled by vengeance, Lilith presented her husband with the head of his torrid lover and then took his life as well. Though she thought the nightmare was over, for Lilith, it had just begun. In the end, the pair of evil occultists had lied to her once they discovered Henry's mistress, the town baker, was actually their own estranged sister. Out of revenge and necessity, they took Lilith to the shoreline and killed her with a rusty hatchet. They shrunk down her head and transformed her soul into that of a wicked demon. To ensure her eternal suffering and damnation, they attached a fiendish curse to it, and the curse can only be initiated when you recite a certain incantation. Do you mean the poem? Exactly. Now, how much did you say you paid for her? Like, $10. Hm, 'cause I'd really love to add her to my collection. Oh, uh. Um, we actually aren't in the market of selling her. Yeah, we were just curious whether it was real or not. Why would you tell him that? LAUREN: I didn't think he'd wanna buy it. Don't sell it to him. Why, it was $10? HUNTER: $200. - Seriously? - Seriously. You got deal. All right, well that sounds like a great way to burn through 200 bucks, man. I'm gonna kill you. All right, man, you have fun with that little head, girls, can we get goin'? ALICE: We'll be listening. (EERIE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) I'm so curious about you. (BIRDS CHIRP) Definitely, yeah. Yeah, I can have Bree send some pictures right over for you. Okay. - Hey. - Hi. Aunt Jane, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Okay, bye. (PHONE BEEPS) What's going on? Give me a second. Some fans brought this over for me today. And lucky for me, I was able to convince them to let me have it for. (LID CLICKS) 200 bucks. And you think it's real? That's what we're gonna find out. Wow, look at you, wheelin' and dealin' on shrunken heads. You know, if this thing's actually legit, it's gonna be worth way more than 200 bucks. Exactly. And check this out. Came with this poem. Apparently, there's a game you play with it. What kind of game do you play with a shrunken head? It's kinda like hot potato meets musical chairs. Yeah, you recite this poem and pass the head around in a circle, and whomever has the head in their hand when the poem ends is out. And you wanna play it on the show? That's what I'm thinkin', yeah. I'm just not sure how to incorporate her yet, though. (SIGHS) I don't know. Bree, do you have any ideas? Bree? (FINGERS SNAP) Come on, I need you with me. What? (FINGERS SNAP) This has gotta stop. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. Look, I just get so anxious, I mean, it's not every day that someone shows up on your doorstep with something like this. I guess not. She has a really cool back story, too. We are so gonna capitalize on this. The viewers are gonna eat it up. What's this? Halloween party this weekend. Word on the street is it's gonna be quite the event. Oh really? - Hello! - Hey guys. - Hey. - All right, what's good? So, my favorites are the vegan blood orange and jazzberry. What's better? Vegan blood orange. All right, I'm trusting you. And what do you want, Nate? Those sound gross, I'll take chocolate. Mm, so original. That's what I know. I cannot believe you still work here. I mean, it's only until I graduate, and then I get a big girl job. Yeah, I guess. So, the real question is, is it on the house, or do we have to pay? Just don't tell my manager. - You're the best. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. Have fun. So, did you listen to Hunter's podcast? Yes, yes I did. Isn't that story so creepy? Yeah, but, I don't really mess around with that type of stuff. Why, are you scared? No, I just don't mess around with that stuff. Why? Oh come on, tell me. Freshman year, I was dating this waitress who was going through some grieving issues because she lost her boyfriend in a traffic accident. That's awful. It was about six months until we started seeing each other. Anyways, one night we were hanging out at her mom's house, and I dozed off, and when I woke up, I couldn't move. I tried to yell for help, but nothing would come out but like a faint whisper. Lauren, I swear, there was like a thousand pounds on my back. And I remember lookin' up at her and thinkin', are you gonna help me, or are you just gonna let me die? So I mustered up all my strength, and I pushed myself up off the ground. And when I asked her why she didn't help, she said there was like some kind of dark energy, or a demon on my back, and she was just too afraid to move. Stop Nate, you're giving me chills. Sorry, it's just. I just wanna make a point that after my experience, you know, I believe there's more after death. Yeah, I agree. That was a good choice. Yeah, you guys like it? Yeah, it was good, it was good. Cool, so will is see you tonight? Yes, you are going to look so good in those pants. (ALICE LAUGHS) I'll see you later. - Okay, see you guys. - You wanna go? Yeah, see ya. (MIDTEMPO INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (HAUNTING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (CRICKETS CHIRP) What's wrong? Sorry, it's just that story you told me. I seriously don't know what I would do if something like that ever happened to me, Nate. I hope it never does, Lauren. (SIGHS) I'd be so scared, I'd probably just let it kill me. Nah, you'd fight it off. Yeah, maybe. (SIGHS) Nate, can I tell you something? Yeah. And promise not to think I'm some crazy person. I just told you a story about how I was attacked by some demon. I highly doubt there's anything you could tell me that would make me think you're crazy. (SIGHS) It's just, did you know sometimes I have dreams about my dead relatives? And they even speak to me. What do they say? That's just it, like, I can see them, and I can kinda make out what they're saying but it's almost like they're trying to warn me or something. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be that Debbie Downer. It's okay. Look, I gotta go. Thanks for listening. - Bye. - Bye. (DOOR THUDS) (CRICKETS CHIRP) (DOOR KNOCKS) Coming. Mom? (MOM LAUGHS) Hi. - Muah. - What a nice surprise. Come on in. MOM: Nice to see you. Nice to see you, too. I just had dinner with Aunt Judy and I picked up you some doughnuts. Thank you. I see that money your father and I have been giving you is put to good use. Oh yeah. Do you want some coffee? No, I think I'm gonna do a drink. Okay, okay. Here, Mama. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. It's so good to see you. It's so good to see you. I tuned into last week's show. - Yeah. - And, truth be told, Hunter, I found it rather dull. - Dull, Mom? - Mm. You found it dull? As a matter of fact, I did. You know, ever since you put that assistant into the mix, your show has, well, it seems to have lost something. Are you serious? Mm. I am. She's nothing but a distraction to you and to your audience. Oh Mom, I don't agree with you. I mean, Bree brings so much to the show. She's an asset. Mm, you would say that. I still can't digest the fact you called my show dull. Well then do something about it. Liven it up a little. Enough with the same old same old zombie, big head... - It's melon heads, Mom. - Whatever. Why don't you indulge more into ghosts and demons. Remember, your Aunt Jane was a medium. I know she was a medium, Mom. Look, tonight's show has both spirits and the afterlife, and it's gonna be awesome. Good, I'll be tunin' in. Mm. I have to go. Please don't bore me with this one. Mom! You know, I'm proud of you, Hunt. Even if I think the show is, well, dull and boring. With that said, I know your judgment gets clouded when you little head think for your big one. Mom, I don't like you talking about that stuff. I know. Ms. Perry. Lookin' good, nice hat. - Hey. - Hi. - I love you. - I love you, too. (DOOR CLICKS) Hey babe, can you get in touch with with Lola? I need to make sure she can still tape the show for us this weekend. (PHONE CLICKS) Hey, are you listening? Yeah, sorry, I was just texting her. Okay. - Hunter. - Yeah? The last time you used her, all you did was complain about how expensive she was. I mean, I can just tape it for you on my phone. Uh, Bree, not this on this one. I mean, we really need to look like we have our stuff together, and showing up with a legitimate camera person is just gonna be a lot more impressive. And let's face it, Bree, it's all about smoke and mirrors. (LAUGHS) Got it? (PHONE BUZZES) She just texted us back, she's in. HUNTER: Perfect. And listen, about this weekend, I really think we need to go bigger with this game. I mean, these kids are gonna be passing around a shrunken head playing musical chairs. And if nothing big happens, we're just gonna look like idiots. Hm, I'm listenin'. Bree, what are you thinkin'? Well, I was thinking that we could get the ghost of Ratchet to actually show up. You know, just stage it, freak 'em out a little bit. Get it all on camera, people think it's real, and then, ratings go through the roof. Hm. Where we gonna find a ghost at? Well, Lola and I already think we have your girl. Yeah? Bree, I like it, I love it. I love you. Book it. ♪ Change from blue right into gray ♪ ♪ With no warning ♪ Whoa warning My man. ♪ And as that color fades You got a minute to talk? Yeah, sure Hunter, what's up? What's the deal this party?

Just doin' my job, spreadin' the word. So this is your party. Yeah, I mean, I'm hosting it, so I guess so. You know, I've got a business proposition for you.

Wow, that's pretty impressive. Hunter Perry, Beyond the Veil. - Ow! - I love the show, dude. Thank you, tune in this weekend. FAN: All right. Wow. (CHUCKLES) So what are you asking, you want like a cut of my percentage or something? No, I don't wanna dime, just a venue. Look, give me 30 minutes tops, in and out. I don't know man, I have to ask... I'd just give in if I was you, he's relentless. What the hell, all right, sure. I'll talk to Echo and set somethin' up. You're awesome, thank you.

Come on in, honey. (DOOR CREAKS) Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, creeps of all ages, you are listening to Beyond the Veil with the one and only Hunter Perry. Thank you so much, Bree, I appreciate that. You guys have tuned in for a great, great show tonight. We're gonna be delving into the Midwest's most renowned urban legends, starting with the melon heads of Kirtland, Ohio. BREE: That sounds fascinating. The Moth Man of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and the mysterious tale of Lilith Ratchet. Now, that's the one that I'm most excited about. Ladies and gentlemen, don't go anywhere, 'cause we'll be right back. Lilith Ratchet, wasn't that the name of your head? (LAUREN SCOFFS) Turn it up. All right, we are back on Beyond the Veil, where we are just starting to get into this mysterious tale of Miss Lilith Ratchet. Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the story, it goes like this. Lilith Ratchet took a hatchet and gave her lover a head in a basket. Play the game and call her name, and one by one, you'll feel her pain. Now, that sounds like a really messed up nursery rhyme to me. That it does. Lilith Ratchet must've been a dark and tortured soul. (HAUNTING MUSIC) She harbored something truly sinister, fueled by years of anger and scorn. Betrayal at the hands of her emotionally abusive husband, and in the end, I wouldn't be surprised if she took some sort of great pleasure in gruesomely decapitating both he and his lover. Wow, he's really putting a new twist on it. HUNTER: You can argue that she had a good reason. Yeah. I get that. A crime of passion. But at the end of the day, for someone to commit a crime that heinous, that vile, well, that individual had to be under the influence of something darker than just hate. Lilith, my friends, was overtaken by something truly evil. Yes friends, in my hand, I have the head of one Lilith Ratchet. And to all of our listeners out there, let me just say that this head is really terrifying. BREE: That she is. How much do you think that head was actually worth? HUNTER: Out there, if the legend is true, I, Hunter Perry, host of Beyond the Veil. You don't think he screwed me over, do you? Know I'm putting myself in grave danger. I'm aware of this, but this is my commitment to you. And that's what I'm willing to do. Hunter, let's take some callers. I'm really interested to see what they have to say about this shrunken head. HUNTER: Let's do it. Ready. All right, Beyond the Veil, you're on the air. CALLER: Hey Hunter Perry, go back to teachin' gym class, you motherfuck... Oh, it looks like we've lost 'em, next caller please. Well, looks like we're off to a great start. Let's head over to caller number two. Beyond the Veil. CALLER: She's real. - (HAUNTING ELECTRONIC MUSIC) - Um, excuse me? Who's this? CALLER: Lilith Ratchet is real. If you play her game, you're going to die. Wow, we're strikin' gold tonight people, this is awesome. So caller, um, exactly how are you so sure about this. CALLER: Because I've played her game, and I've lost so many friends because of it. You will too, if you don't listen to me. You know, with all these callers telling us not to play the game, it's just making me want to play the game even more. And I know exactly where we're gonna play it. And where is that, Hunter? Fright-Fest, mm, this weekend. Big party comin' up. You got it. We're gonna take a short break, and we will be back.

Lauren, I thought that was like a bonding moment between us, a good moment. You don't think that story about you speaking with your dead relatives was just a little weird? I know. I had no business telling you that. I don't even know you. No, I didn't mean it like that. I just, I need time to clear my head. Yeah, yeah, I get it. No worries, I'll give you all the time you need.

I, I tried calling you earlier from the hospital, honey, but I just thought it'd be better if I stopped by. The hospital? Why were you at the hospital? Are you okay? Is Lauren okay, is? Mrs. Miller. Where's Lauren? Honey, this afternoon. (SOBS) This afternoon, I found her dead, oh my god. She cut her wrists in the bathtub. Oh god. Oh god, I was too late. I tried to save her. - (SOBS) No, no, no. - But I couldn't honey. I'm so sorry. ALICE: No, Lauren wouldn't do that! (sobs) She just wouldn't. (CRICKETS CHIRP) MAN: There's nothing I can do. So I took some great shots for you at the party, if I do say so myself. That reminds me, I gotta give Lola a call, see if she finished that video up. (UPTEMPO ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) REPORTER: Turning our attention to some shocking news, alcohol may have played a role in what sheriff's deputies are calling a gruesome discovery. Hunter. Hold on one sec. - Hunter, look. - We want to warn you the details in the story may be upsetting to some viewers. A young man was found in the middle of the street overnight and deputies say he was apparently killed by a hit-and-run driver. Adding that because of the condition of the body that it's possible that he may have been run over more than once. Possibly several times. While details are slim at this point. - I can't believe that. - First responders did note a strong odor of alcohol. You don't think they're gonna blame us, do you? REPORTER: Suggests that alcohol may have played a role. What? REPORTER: The victim will be the subject of an autopsy. - No. - And toxicology screen. Hunter, that has nothing to do with us, - why would they blame us? - The final decision. The sheriff's office is asking for anyone with that information to step forward. I mean, I just can't help but feel somewhow responsible for this. REPORTER: Callers may remain anonymous. - (UPTEMPO ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - Okay, look. Hunter. That is in no way anyone's fault. Okay, Nate was just a victim of circumstance. The wrong place and the wrong time. Look at me. Okay? You're right. Bree, I honestly have no idea what I would do without you. You're the best assistant I could ever ask for. Hunter. (SIGHS) Look, I understand that you're going through a lot. You know, your work, your mom, your life, and I'm trying the best that I can to help you, but you are making me feel like you only love me because I'm your assistant, and not your girlfriend. You can't even kiss me without talking about work. HUNTER: Is that what you want, Bree? (laughs) Is that what you want? No, that's not what I want. Do you want more kisses, like this? - No. - And this? And this? (LAUGHS) I need you to take it seriously. And this? I can give you more kisses. Yow know what I mean. Of course I do, and I'm sorry. Bree, I don't love you because you're my assistant. I love you because you're smart, and you're funny, and you're beautiful. And you're everything I could ever ask for. And so much more. I'm in this for the long haul, Bree. I love you. HUNTER: I love you. No more this. (FINGERS SNAP) No more of that. Promise? I promise. Thanks for helping me close up. I appreciate it. Yeah, for sure, man. Obviously Mary's not gonna be in to help you, so. I'm not gonna stick you with it. Yeah, sad. You know how it happened? I mean, we're gettin' a lot of conflicting stories, but right now, all signs point to a hit and run. That's terrible. He was a good guy. DYLAN: Yeah, he was. And I know how close you guys were, so. I'm sorry. Thanks, man. Hey listen, if I hear from Mary, I'll let you know when things are gonna open up again, but till then, consider it an open-ended vacation. Pretty depressing vacation. All right, well if you need anything, let me know. Thanks, bro. Be good, okay? EMPLOYEE: You too. (OMINOUS ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Alice? Hey, how long have you been out here? Hey. I tried to call you. Baby, I'm sorry my phone's been turned off. I was over at the diner, I was helping clean up, 'cause Mary can't do it, you know? Couldn't say no. Hey, what's wrong? Alice, what's wrong? Lauren's dead. What? How? Uh, they, they found her in her bathtub, and um, she slit her wrists. And they're saying that it was a suicide. Dylan, Lauren wouldn't do that. Oh, I know. I know. Do you think it was that game? The game? No, I don't. Alice. This sucks, and I am so sorry, but sometimes bad things happen to good people, and that's how life goes. I'm sorry. I can, I can see that I'm not getting anywhere with you, so I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna talk to Hunter. DYLAN: Talk to Hunter, are you serious? Alice! (CRICKETS CHIRP) Alice, are you okay? What's the matter? Lauren's dead. Alice, I'm so sorry. They're saying that she killed herself. It's not true, it's not true. Nate's dead too, and they're just saying it was an accident but it wasn't. It was that game. Oh, no no no, it wasn't the game, Alice. Yes it was. I felt something. Alice, what did you feel? I don't know, when I was holding that head, everything got cold. What? You have to believe me. No, no, no, I need you to calm down, I need you to calm down, listen. I have someone who can help us. Someone we can talk to. Do you trust me, Alice? - Yeah. - Okay. I know this might not align with some of your personal beliefs, but I want you to give my Aunt Jane a chance. I trust her. (EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (HUNTER KNOCKS) Everyone, please have a seat. I see one here for you. What's that smell? Homemade incense. It's my own mixture of lemongrass and sage. Lemongrass to help sharpen awareness, and sage is known to keep dark spirits at bay. So Hunter was telling us that you were the one that actually introduced him to the spiritual world and helped to inspire his show. That's amazing. Well, I'm certainly happy to take the responsibility of leading Hunter into the New Age. (DYLAN LAUGHS) The New Age. Laugh all you want, but you're welcome to wait outside. Uh, no, I'm cool. Can you tell us if there's anything evil attached to what's inside? (OMINOUS ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What's the matter? Nothing, must familiarizing myself. What are you doing? Cleansing the energy, smudging for protection. I'm not sure what Hunter has told you about the situation. Hunter doesn't need to tell me anything. I already know. Your friends are here with us. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Both of them. I smell Lauren's perfume. I think it's time we begin. Hunter, you know how this goes. I do. I need a moment to concentrate. (AUNT JANE SIGHS) (HAUNTING ELECTRONIC TONES) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (AUNT JANE GASPS) (AUNT JANE WHIMPERS) - Whoa, are you okay? - Hunter, what's happening? Aunt Jane, answer. (AUNT JANE GASPS) Sorry if I startled you. I'm fine, really. You don't look fine. It's just that your friends are trying to speak to me, and it's so difficult to understand what they're saying. Were you talking to Lauren? I was. Tell us about the head. Tell us if the head had anything to do with what happened. I need a moment of silence. I see headlights. A car swerving to get out of the way. Your friend, had he been drinking? I smell alcohol on his breath. Stop. I don't wanna hear about that. AUNT JANE: It was an accident, Dylan. Un, no shit. You're supposed to tell me things I don't know. ALICE: What about Lauren? Water. I can hear the faucet dripping. I feel the sharp sting of a razor blade against her flesh. I can feel her pain. There's so much sadness. Your friend had many demons, Alice. No, no that's not true. I'm speaking the truth. I'm sorry if it's not what you wanna hear. Alice, maybe you didn't know Lauren as well as you think you did. (PHONE RINGS) They're gone. The connection's lost. Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I thought it was on silent. And it's my sister, of course. Hunter, we're gonna have to cut this short. I'm sorry. No, I think we're done here. Great, awesome, um, Alice, can we go? Oh Alice, sorry I didn't tell you what you wanted to hear, but you should know Lauren did love you very much. You'll be seeing her soon, I promise. Dylan. Dylan, wait! She was lying to us. Alice, I really can't do this right now, okay? She was holding back, Dylan, I know she was, I could feel it. The fact that she's a fraud. You're falling for parlor tricks. Our friends have been dead for two days, two days, and you're getting caught up in all this fantasy nonsense. Frankly, Alice, it's insulting. So what are you saying? I really can't stay here, okay? My best friend just died, I deserve time to process that. I love you, but I don't wanna say something I'm gonna regret. I'm sorry, I'm gonna go, and I will talk to you soon. Dylan! Dylan, wait! (ALICE SIGHS) (CRICKETS CHIRP) - (OMINOUS MUSIC) - Dylan. Who, me? Yeah, you live right down the street, I've seen you before. Uh, yeah, sorry, I, um. I just didn't recognize you. Don't apologize. Rough day? You have no idea. Listen, I, um, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, I just really don't have time for small talk, I gotta get home. I'm sorry about your friend. What did you say? Your friend, you know, the one who had the accident? How horrible. (CROW CAWS) I'm sorry, did I upset you? Looks like you've seen a ghost. How did you know? WOMAN: It's all over the news. No, how did you know he's my friend? I've seen you two before. You know, I apologize, but I gotta get home. Have a good day. WOMAN: It was nice of you to visit his mom. I'm sure she appreciates it. What did you just say? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Jamie. I'll be ready in like two minutes. Two minutes means two minutes, I mean it. No putzing around. Since when did you become Sergeant Andrews? (SCOFFS) You know, this whole sister chauffeur thing is getting pretty old. I'm sorry I can't get my license. I have anxiety, do you want me to kill myself? Not unless I end up killing you first. Now hurry up. What is that? (MOUSE CLICKS) What? (PHONE RINGS) HUNTER: Hunter Perry. Hunter, do you have a minute? Yeah, of course, what's up? I was going through some of the footage from the other night, and I think I caught something on camera. Wait what, what do you mean, something? I don't know, I thought I saw something the other night, but I wasn't quite sure until I was able to pull up the footage. Wait, what are you talking about, what did you see? - It's a woman. - A woman? Oh, so your friend showed up. LOLA: What, my friend? Yeah, your friend that we paid to dress up as Lilith and scare the audience. Hunter, my friend bailed last minute. I thought she told you that. Wait what? Here, I'll just send you a screenshot of the image. Hey baby, it's me. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I was just calling to check in on you, and to make sure that Alice is okay. I mean, she seemed pretty upset after we left Aunt Jane's house. But uh, I'm about to take Jamie to work, so I'll give you a call a little bit later after I drop her off. Okay, I love you, bye. Jamie? Holy shit, Lola, I need you to send me a copy of that video now. This is important, do you understand? Oh, um, okay. HUNTER: Look, I gotta go right now, just get me that video as soon as you can. (KEYS JINGLE) (ENGINE RUMBLES) (PHONE RINGS) Perfect timing. What's going on? My car won't start. HUNTER: What do you mean, what's it doing? I don't know, it just keeps making noises. It's like something just fell off of it. I don't know if it was my muffler or what, but. Hold on one second. (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What the hell? No no, nothing, nevermind. I just feel like I've been seeing stuff ever since we left Aunt Jane's. Hold on one second, let me try this again. (ENGINE RUMBLES) Okay, good, we're good. HUNTER: Did it start? Yeah, it turned on. - Good. - Yeah. Listen, Lola sent me the pic and... - What? - It's a woman. Hunter, I can't hear you. (HUNTER MUMBLES) Hunter. Hey hey, hold on, Jamie's beeping in. What? Where's my black bra? BREE: I'm wearing it. (SIGHS) I'm gonna kill you. Hello? HUNTER: Hey, Bree, can you hear? Hunter, I cannot hear you. Listen, do not go into the car. I'm on my way, I will pick you up, just go back in the house. - You're breaking up. - Bree.

College senior, Bree Walker. Walker was found deceased in her vehicle, still in her garage. Officials are investigating the death as an apparent suicide, and friends are shocked, recalling her love of life and her bright future. Walker was 22. Family and friends can't pay their last.

Look man, this is not the time. I'd rethink that, Hunter. I'm sure you have a few questions regarding the game by this point. HUNTER: How do you know about the game? From your radio show, of course. I'm a big fan. Three people are dead, do not joke with me right now, man. Only three? It sounds like she's taking her time with this one. She must like you. I know who you are, I remember you. You called in the show the other day. Are you behind all of this? You seem to know a lot about what's going on. MAN: Because I played the game. - What? - Didn't you win? - Why? - Just answer the question. Yeah I won, why? Because that gives you time. Let me ask you this. How many people have died since you played? HUNTER: Three. The clock is ticking, my friend. Three to go. That is, unless you don't take matters into your own hands. You can stop the bleeding. I'm not listening to your bullshit anymore, seriously. You want the truth? You already know it. Lilith Ratchet is not just a ghost. She's a demon, a poltergeist. She's not restricted to the spiritual realm. She can hurt you, and she intends to. Yes, so all of that's really, really obvious now, man, but what do you want me to do, just sit here and wait for her to come find me? You have choices. Two, to be specific. The first is exactly that, you die. That tends to be the outcome. That's not happening. What's the other choice? Think of the game, Hunter. The players are dying in a specific order. But what would happen if you were to disrupt that? You need to think of what she wants. Think of the poem, Hunter. She wants others to feel her pain. So, you need to give her what she wants. I think you already know what that is. No man, you're insane. MAN: Don't shoot the messenger. I'm speaking from experience. No, you're crazy. I'm signing off. You'll see. It's all about self-preservation, Hunter. Remember that, good luck. (CRICKETS CHIRP) Dylan? (SWITCH CLICKS) (KEYS JINGLE) Dylan? (DOOR CREAKS) Dylan? Dylan?

Hunter, I can't find Dylan. - What's wrong? - Can we see the owner, would that be okay? Yeah yeah, come on inside. Hey boss? You need to speak to these two. Echo, is Dylan here? No, I haven't seen him since the party. Hunter, I went to his apartment, and his door was open, and he wasn't there. I don't know what to do. Just calm down. What's going on with Dylan? Listen, it's a really long story. We conjured something the night of that party. Something evil, now three of our friends are dead, and now we think Dylan's next. I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's true. No, I don't want that! I'm being serious, we're being stalked by the ghost of Lilith Ratchet! (OBJECTS RUSTLE) What the hell what that?
