He comes from an elementary school in Walthamstow His father's is a tobacconist The headmaster asked us to take him Because of this Fleming report What ever is that? Oh well the Board of Education set up a committee on public schools To find out if we are as black like some people like too paint us Oh and are we? Well,it's come to the conclusion that more boys like Read should come to schools like Saint Bury -That's right Mr Lorraine -Yes Thank you So the Headmaster's persuaded the governors to give the boy a scholarship -It's an experiment -What do you think of the idea,Daddy -Will it work? -Ah the Head's a very shrewd man I don't think he believes it for one moment He just doesn't want to be labelled as a die-hard reactionary -What's in these? -Fish paste I mean to say it,how are you going to mix a boy whose fathers is a general with a boy whose parents keep a grocer's shop in Pimlico -Hey Lorraine - Well boys are very malleable creatures They usually fill in provided they've given a chance -Don't you think? -Oh yes, Daddy,you must give him a chance Oh naturally I'll give him every chance,that's fair And I haven't told anyone where he comes from not even village -Ham is for you -Thank you -Oh Pete come and sit here -Yes,Bernie At times it was hundred times mined fortresses And in the daylight I say,did you see how Audrey looked like? -She is a smash -Yes,she is in the reins,isn't she?

That's not what they make you do it -Oh -No they just want you to bend down -so they an kick you up the arse -Read Don't use that word,Read,I don't like it -Understand? -Yes sir Now listen to me and put your shoulders back,man Like this Now whether you like our customs or not they're going to be part of your life here for the next three or four years We have a great tradition to keep up And I will not tolerate rudeness or slackness in any shape or form -Is that clear? -Yes,Sir Right Now get out and get on with it -Leave to go please ,Sir? -Yes,yes,get out What can I do?

Yes,I'll up at the crack of dawn I hope you like it here You sound doubtful,are you? No,not really,I love this place myself Then I was born here I do think there are in some ways you have lot to get used to In what way? Well,you've been out in the world and know what goes on there Saint Bury is a little community on its own cut off from everything Don't you think that in the future Schools will have to teach life as well as history I don't think the average master here knows very much about life -Do you see what I mean? -Well,I'm beginning to Read What the devil you doing,Read? I won't stopping here let go away Just a minute Stop your idiot,the door is locked anyway -I'm not stopping -I'll tell you the doors are closed,shut up or you wake up the entire school Lorraine,I think I go back to the house -Won't tell any others will you? -Of course,I won't -Good night Lorraine -Good night I think we'd better have a talk about this,haven't we? Come here Come on Maybe better sit down I'd rather stand All right,as you like You're getting a bit fed up aren't you? Only go home I want to go home Why? I think I would sit down if I were you That's right Have you got a handkerchief? -No -Here Have this one Here you are And give it back When it is washed Do your father stock a tobacco called Hallam mixture? I don't think so Well,I must go sometimes with you When did he play soccer for the army? I don't know but he did I don't doubt it if you say so This is the first time you've been away from home,isn't it? Yes,Sir What would you do if I send you home now? Never come back Yes I rather gathered that When you heard you would come here,did you want to come? -Yes,Sir -Why? Because I thought I'd stand a better chance to learn about things The education here is pretty good,you know If you can stick the other side of it There are things Saint Bury can give you and I don't just mean snob advantages are not reliable What sort of things? Knowledge for one thing you'll have time to fill your mind here,Read This place hasn't got bad record,you know It's turned out scientists, poets,soldiers,statesmen You might add to that record You see,Read you and I both new boys here -So we've got a bond in common -You're a master I know but I'm a new master I expect there was a time when your father hated the army But he didn't chuck it,did he? No And you can't run away from life like this just because you don't like it,you know There are a lot of snobs here Well they're not they're just being brought up in a different environment,that's all It's quite likely they think you are a snob -Me -Oh don't you sometimes brag about your father playing soccer for the army Yes,that's different Read You know it's my duty to tell Mr Hartley about this don't you? Yes,Sir Well instead I,I'm going to forget about it But only on one condition That you stand up to the things you don't like here It's a new word to Read but I think it's got something to offer you Will you stick it? Yes,Sir Good Now the porter does not lock up until ten You'd better go back the way you came And remember not a word to anyone Yes,Sir -Thanks -Bye Why do we always have to write home on Sundays Never have anything to say But if you write to tell you,if you stink,Tracey They know that already If I was you,Fitch,I'll address your remarks to your pal,Read Oh,shut up you two I'm trying to write a letter You lousy I'm sure mother can afford to buy you new clothes mine can't Read You horrid little boy go and report yourself to Mr Hartley at once How is young Jack doing?

Everybody does it at first I'd like to see another boy cane me That's to teach him discipline But they are not all going to be Sergeant Majors,are they? Wouldn't do you know how to do a bit of house work,Percy You mean to say you can't even whistle at girls? I expect they think that's common Just a different system that's all It's a snob system that's what it is Well it turned out some pretty famous people Oh what's sort of people Jack? Generals, prime ministers all sorts Yes,that's quite right,isn't it it dad? Oh my right ladies and gentlemen the Honourable Jack Read MP LDD What's LDD?

They don't like me and I don't like them So they don't fight there Well,I told you Jack come away tomorrow It was your mother who was so keen on this idea,I was against it from the start -I'll write to Mr Hartley tomorrow -Don't do that I'll stick it out Saint Bury,Saint Bury Oh,Read don't throw this at me will you? Promise That's right John Mead is the head of the house this term He's not too bad I wonder what the new boys are like Slimy lot,aren't they? Yes pretty ruinous Tell me what did you do in the hols? Nothing much I'll say I got a shot up,so did Read Oh,Lord I'll have Hartley this term,that'll be sweat And I Lorraine,thanks heaven -What it is Johnson? -Oh yes You chaps should find your coup's caps -I just signed them -Congratus Congratus,Read Thanks very much,Johnson Well done both of you Yes,it is good, but it's not good enough Now look Read try and imagine this little wooden ship No bigger than a modern fishing boat Sailing out of Plymouth Harbor early one morning For three years nothing's heard of her she is probably given up for lost Then one day her sails are sighted from Plymouth Hove She's home from new lands and charted seas loaded to the gunwales with treasure and most exciting news of all a Golden hind under Drake's command has sailed right around the world Surely you can write about that can't you? Yes,sure I can No idea Read No idea at all I told you a hundred times to keep your hands together on the handles Go and sweep that up,Tracey You are still a fag till the end of this term -I said sweep it up -Sweep it up yourself Thank you for that,Tracey What's going on here Who started it? I did,Sir Why? All right,I just started it I see Well,this is another place and another way to fight Do you want to go on with it Tracey? Yes,Sir All right Both be in the gym at 6 o'clock tonight Are there any to pick ball on Read,any takers? Break it,break away I think you both had about enough,haven't you? Yes,Sir Oh,well if you have,I have anyway so shake hands,go on But a study in this house Lorraine is a privilege I realize that but personally I think Read's owned it After all,it is usual for someone of his seniority No,no a boy with that background is always an uncertainty and I won't take chances Have you seen his background? What do you mean? Well you accept other boys backgrounds without seeing them Why can't you accept Read's? Because with my experience one knows these things instinctively You know ,Lorraine, you're always trying to alter things Oh why not? If they're out of date Are you suggesting that Saint Bury is out of date? Very well Extraordinary chap And we of this school after over five years of war Humbly thank God that he has seen fit to grant us victory and we pray to Him that we may for many years to come continue our work here at Saint Bury in peace We will now sing the first and last verses of the hymn o valiant house -Good bye come down here again won't you? -I'll do that -Welcome home,Lynne -Thank you,Mr Stevens You've been away far too long Tell me,Mrs Hartley,how is Lloyd He's in school but I'm very worried about him Mummy is trying to make him see a doctor You know daddy he's very stubborn I'm sure he ought to You're trying to persuade him,won't you Mrs Hartley? I'll do my best Request from the headmaster a command Thank you,Lynne, I must flush off now I've got a meeting with the school governors We are going to discuss the perform of the new war memorial -Good bye,Mrs Hartley -Good bye Lynne-Good bye You've heard the governor's views,Stringer And you haven't said a word How about it? Well, Sir James, I would like to see a plaque placed in the chapel commemorating the names of those boys who died Now that should cost very little With the remain of the money I would like to do two things One establish scholarships and free places for the sons of Old boys who fell in the war and to pay for other boys of the right type whose parents couldn't afford our fees -You mean like that boy,Read -Exactly Sir James and secondly to help to send such boys from here when necessary to the Universities I've been talking to Hartley,Sir James He feels strongly that this money should be spent on a new school hall I agree with him,we need one badly Well I am bound to say that I am most strongly against making the dead an excuse for enriching the school Oh,come,come Stringer,surely a memorial must be something tangible, something you can see This scholarship scheme won't work,Stringer Apart from that we must keep up the tone of the old place I'd say you chaps are getting a bit too reactionary in your old age,aren't you? Look you say here the monarchical system in Germany during the 14th and 15th centuries can be compared with that of England during the same period -Yes,Sir -That's absolute nonsense Look go down at Becker's and get a book called Europe and the Middle Ages by Geoff Black Yes,Sir -And you can put it down at me if you like -Thank you,Sir now take this gross distortion of the truth -and hop it -Yes,Sir BTW Mr Stevens tells me your French is very much better this term I read French last holiday, there's a continental paper shop near us Well that's not reading French Oh yes it is,Sir,you can read La vie parisienne,you can read anything I hope you're learn more languages here than that Let me see this is your third year,isn't it? Yes You thought what you're going to do when you leave Well,Sir, I,I'd like to teach Oh,why? Well,Sir Well,you know Sir I think it's worth doing Good of course you'd have to have a degree,you know Yes,Sir Do you think so,that there's any chance of my getting a scholarship to Cambridge Do you want my candid opinion? Yes,Sir Boy you've got a quick and very intelligent mind You grasped the bounce of the subjects very rapidly But you're weak on developing it Now,there is no use my saying you got a scholarship brain Because quite frankly, I, I don't think you have Does that disappoint you? Yes,it does rather Of course you could go up to Cambridge in the ordinary way Yes but what would it cost? Dependent on your college but from 250£ to 300£ a year Dad could never afford that,Sir -Well,we'll have to cease our break -Yes,Sir Anyway come along now and don't forget about that book Righto,Sir -Yes? Have you a book called Europe in the Middle Ages Have we dad? Is that the one by GF Black? Yes that's it In the stockroom I think It would be Would you mind holding the ladder for me? Thank you Didn't I see you in Barton Woods on Sunday? Oh did you? Sitting under a tree reading It's a quiet place to work I often go there So do I -This is it,isn't it? -Yes,that's all right Would you put it down to Mr Lorraine,Cloisters,please Okie-dokie Thanks Perhaps I'll see next time when you are in Barton Woods Maybe -Good bye -Good bye Tell me,Head,did you put my point of view? Well I,I didn't have to Hartley The bishop put it for you very clearly What have people of this type ever done to justify education That's surely depends on how we educate them Well,if I may say so Head I don't propose to have any more boys like Read in my house And the Ministry of Education can go to the devil But surely,daddy,this scholarship idea is such a good one It means that Mr Stringer can pick out the boys with a good brain -Exactly -I think of a memorial should give some visible sign to the next generations So that they'll remember But daddy Did the boys of your house remember the dead of the last war? The living forget the dead very quickly If we knew what they wanted us to do Don't you think it would be to try and help the living? Yes,Hartley,I do feel that's absolutely true I wish goodness you'd never ask me to take this boy,Head I've never really trusted him and I don't suppose I ever shall I asked you to take him partly for a very good reason Because you and Mrs Hartley have made this house the finest in the schools I thought in this atmosphere, young Read would have the best chance And I get to be convinced that the experiment has failed Failed? But surely,Head, without the cooperation without the House Masters it must fail I accepted this boy because you asked me to but Carter,Robottom,Linklater all house masters of some experience are dead against the idea Always have been and always will It must fail Good shot Lorraine Feeling like that are you? Just a bit that's game isn't it? Frustrated? I've had three years of it you know At Saint Bury's that's not long It's long enough to make up my mind as well I'm going to stay or not Is it daddy? Well no,not exactly as a man I like him a lot but as (?) to mind here Lynne,which I simply can't stand Your father rather espouse it Yeah I do hope you don't mind saying all this -If you leave what will you do? -I don't know yet But you can't fight against a stone wall then Let's go back to the house and have a drink All right Hello What to do to this Lorraine, Alex Stevens has just told me that he saw Read in Barton woods with a girl A girl? That's the boy you try to make a prefect Well,Lorraine,your judgement You can call that sort of ???? with the house He comes from a slum and got a mind like a slum Lynne,come and help with the laundry,will you dear? Well,not a very serious offence is it? Going out with a girl? After all,it's only natural isn't it? God knows how they are cooped up here for nearly nine months in a year and they never speak to one Boys aren't made of wood you know I know more about boys than you do,Lorraine I doubt if you know more about Read Have you heard his side of the case? I sent for it but do you think I don't know? A boy like that could always revert to type,always Is that quite fair Now look here,Lorraine, ever since that boy came here You've taken his side against me -You do.. -Yes you have It's been unspoken criticism, I know it's been there Hartley,you've never given that boy a chance You've done him out of hand ever since he came here because you were unable to understand him -How dare you talk like that -I'm sorry it's got to be said You don't like Read whenever he's done anything good instead praising him you patronized him Now,that's going to be your future attitude to boys like Read and whether you like it or not they are coming here Then I don't feel I want to work with you All right then I'll get another house tutor At least I thought you were loyal I am,I'm loyal to the things I believe in and this plan will never succeed while men like you are trying in every possible way to wreck it And Saint Bury,I regret to say is full of men like you, men who will not try and see what's happening around them Please,accept this is my resignation You'll have to give that to the Head and its usual with a term's notice Very well,I'll leave at the end of next term Come in You wanted me,Sir Yes,follow me Close the door Now,Read, Mr. Stephens tells me that he saw you in Barton woods with a girl -Is that true? -Yes,Sir -Who was this girl -Miss Beckett,Sir,from the bookshop You picked her up? Well,no Sir,not exactly, she sort of picked me up You realize that going out with the girls is against the rules Well,Sir, I was just doing some prep for Mr Lorraine,some reading,Sir She came along Everyone in the school knows her so -We call her.. -Well,what do you call her? And what do you call her? Well, actually,Sir,we call her plum tart How interesting -Did you speak to her first? -Well,no,Sir,actually she spoke to me What happened? So we just went for a walk You knew you were breaking the rules Well,Sir,I never thought about that You never thought about it Then I shall make you think about it Shall I report you to the headmaster or will you take a beating instead? I'll take a beating,Sir Right Bend over And I wanted to know if you think you can manage it Well,how much would it cost? That's what it boils down to Mr Lorraine Well, three years a little under a thousand pounds I'd say Oh dear that's a lot of money,you know Yes,still a lot of money But if he's going to be a schoolmaster he's got to have a degree and that means going to university Of course we should like the boy to have his chance Now he's got so far I guess I could raise a couple of hundred on the business And there's your army pension too,dad Yes, how good that is No I don't honestly say we can Mr Lorraine When wound he have to go? Oh,not till the end of the next year at the earliest But we ought to enter his name one of the colleges as soon as possible Well you enter his name,Mr Lorraine -Hear half a minute ago.. -No,you enter his name We are finding the money somehow Well,think it over Good bye and thank you very much for my tea Shall we be seeing you down the school on the Commemoration day? No,I don't think so thank you We wouldn't want Jack to feel,well,you know Thanks all the same Good bye Mr Read Good bye,Mr Lorraine,and thanks for all you done for the boys Really the first chance time I've had to thank you Not at all,I think he's worth it -Don't forget your Hallam mixture -Oh,thank you very much Now look here mother, how do you think we're gonna find a thousand pounds Daddy's he's got to go, we've got every year to rise it Yes but thousand pounds that's a devil of a lot of money,you know Made it clear,dad before I married you I was earning a living and I can do it again easy It's only for a couple of years If Mr Lorraine says he's worth it Well,it's up to us You know I had this room till I was 17,Lorraine They used to be bars on this window to keep me from falling out I wonder if I should ever say to my son This is the nursery here my son Your mother thought the thoughts of youth which year by year and one by one a touch of life was turned to truth That made a nice miserable new bode doesn't it? Daddy would slay me BTW did I tell you I was going away Going away? -Why no? Where to? -To London I'm going to get a job I can't go on kicking my heels around here Well, I'm sorry you are getting a job in London I had one too To offer you myself Lorraine I'm afraid now it's not a very good one I might like it I wanted you to marry me I will marry you Lorraine Do you want to know why? Why? Yes,please Because I love you terribly I've loved you my darling for nearly three years Lorraine is in? Oh,yes I see you are Well I only wanted you to run up the Sandford's for medicine for Webb mind you he is coughing rather badly I can do it if you are too busy Mrs Hartley Lynne has just said she'll marry me Oh you had Oh I'm delighted I thought you were just Oh,well,no Oh my dear,I am so,so glad -May I kiss you too Lorraine? -Oh,yes rather Mummy,what's daddy going to say? Oh dear yes Or you mean you don't think I am sort of son-in-law he'd choose,ah? Well,it's going to be a rather shock to him He's supposed to be taking things quietly the doctor examined him this morning and his heart's not too good -Mummy it's nothing serious? -Oh,dear,no,no Stepwise got to know sometimes,hasn't he? I think I'll go and tell him now Oh mummy what about Webb minor's medicine? Let him cough his head off, this is important -Darling -Yes? Have you had a lot of experience with women? -Raw heaps -Who? I was known as the licentious Lorraine and that I'll remain Oh darling Read For what we have received may the Lord make us truly thankful Amen Well,Read,there's nobody we can hope to (?),aren't you? Yes,Sir BTW whether I get that letter out said your dozens of subject appeal to,ah? I'm sorry Sir Well what's the held up? Well,Sir I don't really seem to have had very much time,Sir Oh rubbish it's a week overdue now Well,Sir I,I don't think as much point with going on with extra history,Sir What on earth do you mean? I'm going to leave Leave? To where? Leave Saint Bury But why? Because I got to,Sir Now look here,Read,you and I had known each other quite a long time let's have it Go on,out with it Well,Sir I've just found out that my mother's going out to work again to pay for my education Are you sure about this? My cousin wrote me from home,he found out I can't let do it,Sir, I've got to leave Now hold on a minute I,I don't think she is doing it to keep you here -I rather sense this is my fault -Your fault,Sir? Well,I went to see your people,Read to find out whether they can afford to send you up to Cambridge I told them what it would cost and they tell me to go ahead and enter you It seems your mother's a very determined woman,Read She is,Sir Well if you throw your hand in now you'll be letting her down terribly So don't do anything stupid and above all Don't let her know you found out It'll only hurt her Now, we we've got to find some other way out What's on your mind Lorraine? It's young Read,Lynne, I've got to get him to Cambridge somehow It all comes back to daddy doesn't it? When I think of that Memorial Fund being squandered on some pipping new building it makes me absolutely sick He's not just being pigheaded, darling,he believes he's right He loves Saint Bury He is Saint Bury He's been his work for over 30 years You mustn't blame him for being a bit foggy about what's go on outside I don't blame him money I wish I could make him see if he agreed to this scholarship scheme the rest would follow him you know that Yes I know,but we can't change him,Lorraine The lights are going to come in from outside Yes,I'm afraid you're right Only we shan't be here to see it Wait a minute though -Look when's the commem day? -July the 16th Why? You said light from the outside,didn't you? Well,I think I know how to let some in You have heard from the headmaster of our record this year in scholarships to the universities He has told you also that once again we have beaten Cranbria at football Further he has informed you that during the past year we have had four cases of measles three of chickenpox and that one boy fell down a disused well and broke his ankle but but I have no doubt that the piece of news I am now going to give him will come as a considerable surprise from my position on this rostrum,Sir, I demand that next week these hard-working undernourished and long-suffering boys be given an extra half holiday Are you sure they'll turn up? Well I hope so I told that it is very important Look,darling, I must go now, Mummy will be getting fussed about the tea All right,good bye -Hello,Lorraine -Good afternoon Head Well,what do you think of the parents this year? I think they're improving don't you? Yes,have you heard the doctor's verdict on Hartley? Yes I have I'm very sorry He's got to give up the house at the end of term I know it's his bad luck Look here Lorraine I want you to withdraw your resignation And take up the Hartley's house when he leaves I'm afraid I can't do that Head For goodness sake,Lorraine,why not? Look,Head, Hartley's has given 20 years of his life to Cloisters And he's forced to chuck it now just because he's a sick man He,he's parting with something he's created and loved Do you think he wants to hand over to someone with the views he disagrees so violently No I'm afraid my respect for him is too great Well thank you for telling me but I'm still very sorry Oh well hit BTW the governor's meeting after the dance tonight to take a final decision on our War Memorial Proposal Yes I know ,oh excuse me head will you I think I see a light on the horizon Light on? Mind if I nobble another one,Mrs Hartley? -No do,Lynne please another cup of tea -Yes,of course I do I'm sorry about Gerald first time to get mumps I hope it doesn't spread Oh,so do I No thank you I don't want any more,thank you We must be going,don't take me over the article,Mr Hartley,he's paid the picture -I'm sure it's terrible -It's a nude God gracious at your age Right mother,it's a man I should hope so Oh,Mrs Hartley I don't think you've met Mr and Mrs Read,have you I'm so glad you could come down to see us -How do you do -How do you do -Do you have some tea won't you? -Thank you Madam -Goodbye Mrs Hartley -Good bye Lady Tracey Ronald do stop annoying your fingers I don't think you know my husband do you? Good bye Mrs Hartley -Goodbye -Thanks for looking after Gerald -Pleased to meet you Mr. Hartley -How do you do -Heard a lot about you,Sir -Oh how do you do -You sit down -Thank you very much I think I'll go and chase up young Jack -What time did you arrive? -Well we got in about two We had a bite at the dinner at the local you know But you should have come here That's what I said only father's independent Have you ,have you seen over the school? Well we had a glance on our way out from the cricket field Lovely place you've got here Oh lovely buildings so old aren't they? -16th century -Why I never -Dad? -Thank you-Thank you You haven't been down here before have you? -No,first time -We just shut up the shop I see Mum -Hello,Jack -Dad How are you,son? -Looked surprised(?), did you -No -Have tea? -Yes,thank you,Mrs Hartley Well I suggest that as soon as your parents had theirs you take your mother for a look around the house you'd like like to see where Jack lives,wouldn't you? -Oh I would yes -And I expect You'd like to have a talk with daddy,Mr Read Supposing you take Mr. Read around the school,daddy Oh thank you Why yes, certainly of course I'll be quite frank with you Mr Hartley When I first heard that Jack could come here I wasn't too happy about it I wasn't worrying whether our Jack would suit your school I was wandering whether your school would suit our Jack Oh,I see You see I always looked on this is a sort of experiment which might or might not come off I'm sure we agree on that point But now I'm feeling very different about it Oh,in what way? Well,this sort of school doesn't only go in for book learning You teach them things here Mr Hartley that they don't learn in other places What sort of things? Well,team spirit for one thing and self confidence and how to get on with the other fellows And good manners too I hope Yes,that's one thing I always used to say about Hitler He never had any manners To be truthful Mr Read your boy has been a problem to me I can understand that, Sir you're not used to that sort of boy That's what I meant by getting on with the other fellows If Jack can get on with you I reckon he can get on with anybody Thank you Been under a man like you Mr Hartley that's given our Jack the finest start he could possibly have I only wish I'd had an opportunity like it when I was his age I think you owe your thanks to Mr Lorraine,not me But Mr Lorraine is not the house master In the long run at a school like this it's the house masters that count I know that well enough like the sergeant majors in the army the colonel used to say to me there are a rough lot make them into men,Sergeant major,make them into men and I did Yes I can believe you did I don't know if you're aware of it Mr Hartley But your house has come to mean a great deal to our Jack Very good of you to tell me In all the time you've been here I don't suppose you ever have had what you'd call a real failure have you? Well,I don't quite know what to say I know well enough Well,they catch the train,alright? Yes,dear,I tried to persuade them to stay but they couldn't Good chap,old Read You know he tells me he wants the boy to be a schoolmaster I think that's rather a compliment to you,dear I see I have become old haven't I? Nonsense,Lloyd you've hardly changed since we first met Yes,in a way that's rather what I meant Excuse me,Sir,may I have this dance Mrs Hartley I should like to,Jack -The Douglas still at it,Hartley? -Yes I knew Give the boy a chance,Lloyd dear Yes daddy,you must give him a chance Amen,you never give a man by chance 20 boys being sons of poor townsmen of Saint Bury to be maintained out of the foundation of the school of native genius as far as maybe and apt to learn the rest to pay in custom with other schools and grammar We have now been discussing the same point for exactly one hour and 42 minutes We really must make up our minds I don't know if you chaps are too old but I want to have a crack at the dancing I still ask Sir James what is the point of trying to educate these boys amid surroundings to which they are quite unaccustomed in the long run what good will it do May I answer that question,Sir James? I don't know why the Dickens you're here ,Hartley But come in,come in Please forgive my bursting in like this It's probably the last time I shall meet you all together You see,I feel that the school is in grave danger of making a mistake for which I should be largely responsible and I want before it's too late to try to prevent it I don't want to interrupt the proceedings for longer that I can help but as so many of you here have contributed so generously to the War Memorial Fund Sir James Caulfield has asked me to announce the governor's decision There will be a plaque placed in the chapel commemorating the names of all Saint Buryin's who fell The balance will be spent in finding scholarships and to aid some boys to go on from here to the university,thank you very much This is just a small gift from Cloister so we'd like you to accept Every boy has contributed freely and without any undue persuasion but I'm afraid I'm not much of a hand at making speeches,Sir Anyway you'll see by the inscription how we feel about your leaving To Lloyd Hartley MA from the boys of his house in affection and gratitude for he's a jolly good fellow Three hips for Mrs Hartley,hip,hip,hurrah One more for luck hip,hip,hurrah Well Lynne,dear,that's our last house supper Lorraine help yourself to whisky and soda Thanks Well,they did cheer him tonight,didn't they? It was grand And how they cheered Mummy Yes and what for? -May I tell you? -Yes,please do Well,then I will They choose you,my dear,to them you've been a mother and a friend in your own way you fought their battles for them though you've never been disloyal to Lloyd sometimes they felt that you were on their side That's why they cheered you tonight In their hearts they'll go on cheering you all their lives Is this true? Every word of it I'm glad you told her that -Where's Lloyd -In the study Do you think he'd like a drink? I think he deserves one Come in I thought you'd might like a nightcap Oh thank you,I'd love it You know I never expected that cigarette box I wonder who would get this house So do I What about Alex Stevens? No,no too slack,too fond of fishing Why did you refuse it,Lorraine? I told you I wanted to change I suppose your refusal has nothing to do with me With you? How do you mean? Well,we've had our arguments in the past I thought -No,no,no -Oh It isn't easy a handing over this house I'd like my successor to carry it on Well in the way I'd like it carried on Naturally I see that It's no that I objected to change it's just that I can't change myself That's the penalty of growing older I suppose I just got vain and pompous,I think my way is the best A poor pretty sound in the past Maybe but I've gone past with them Well,tomorrow I start packing up and hand the future over to someone else I wonder who? It rests with Head Does it? I believe it rests with me I believe you refused this job because you didn't want to hurt me Well,what if I did You wouldn't like me here,Lloyd,would you? Not in your shoes Listen to me Lorraine I've been doing some hard thinking lately You're the man to do the kind of job that's coming The kind of job I know I can't do I'm asking you now before it's too late to take on this house next term No,a new man an outsider, that's much the best Not from my point of view because I want the things that are good in this house to remain and in your hands they would Well I'd love to ?? anything you know that -But -Then will you Well,if you really mean that Lloyd I will Thank you Lorraine,thank you very much Daddy,mommy's gone up to bed Ah,Lynne,I've got some news for you Lorraine has just agreed to take on the house What? Oh darling And if you're half as good house masters wife with your mother was You won't do so badly What is all that noise? Come in May I speak to you,please,Sir Yes what is it You're wanted in the top room,Sir I'll stop that row "We want Mr Hartley" What made you change your mind,darling? Your father,you know, I really think he wants me Oh good Now look, when we get our own furniture I think we'd better have the desk Oh,well there I suppose Oh Lorraine this is going to be wonderful Tell me do you think mother will give advice? Yes and then she is a very exceptional woman Will you take it? No unless I'm a very exceptional daughter Oh,there you are ,Sir Thompson said you wanted to see me before I went to bed,Sir Come in,Read,I've got some news for you I thought you might like to know that Mr Hartley is recommended that you go on to Cambridge after you leave here Gosh,Sir And can you keep your mouth shut? Try to,Sir Well,I'm taking on this house from next term Gosh I am glad,Sir Right,go along to bed,remember not a word to anyone Yes,Sir,good night Sir, good night Mrs Lorraine No,Jack not yet -Well, next time anyway,good night -Good night Gosh,Sir Nothing,Sir Jolly good show,Sir -Good night -Good night,Read Oh daddy go up to mother at once They wanted a rag so they got a rag But I downed six of them before they got me Oh,daddy,really I like to hide,now I go to bed Good night,you two Don't alter my study rolly until tomorrow,tonight it's still mine And Lorraine Don't keep Lynne down here too long All right,daddy,we're just coming Will ours be a jolly good show,darling?
