No one... Kazumi's Lying! Why would she? I don't know. Okay... Bring her here, and ask her yourself. - You?ll realize that she's Lying. - Let's do it. I'm at a certain place right now, so I can't go to meet you. I would be grateful if you would come to me. It has something to do with the aerosol you put in the miso soup. I want to talk to you.

You can go to a place you've never been before.: the bottom of the ocean. Remember me? What is this? Don't touch me! This is the girl I brought here. You set me up with the cassette tape? Why? You're a liar. You told him nothing but lies about Yasushi. Yasushi... Why did you say he was dead? Because he is... What are you doing? The background is important in order to effectively utilize the model. Are you happier being the girl who gets picked on? As Long as you get back at them, it's okay. Why are you stopping me? I thought I might enjoy myself. Stop it! I used to work at a slaughterhouse, so I could take pictures. It really made me lose my appetite. Day after day, I was surrounded by the stench of death, and the color of blood. Before I knew it, I had become neurotic. But even then, I still wanted to be with women. I tried to pay for sex. However... I wasn't ever able to satisfy a first-rate woman, with my thing the way it is, because they all want to feel it. My tool is completely useless... But this is appropriate for a third-rate woman Like yourself, because you can have the pleasure you wanted. Just Leave it in until you die. Take it with you to the grave. slaughterhouse You need to tell me about Yasushi Sakaguchi. I did. I want the truth. I know you're Lying. Yasushi Sakaguchi jumped off the roof of Yoshimura Academy, killing himself. Really? Then maybe it's true. This is the secret that not even you could uncover, Mr. Detective. Go ahead... It's alright. Yasushi, I said there's nothing to worry about. Just don't put it in deep. It feels really weird. Let me have it for a sec. I don't understand it very well, but it feels incredible. Hurry! Virgin Virgin Virgin Virgin... Death Death Death Death... Yasushi ruptured my hymen with the vibrator... it must have been a big shock. Would a guy really kill himself over something Like that? Why did you have me search for him? Yasushi isn't dead! Yasushi made the video as a kind of diary. One day, he brought the video over to my house. But after that, he ran off somewhere. He committed suicide, isn't that right? We're in love with each other. The two of us. Lick up the blood! Damn kid. Fuck me. I?LL make it so that You?ll be able to do it. See? You're starting to feel it. Is this the bottom of the ocean? Kozue Hojo's Photo Exhibit.: Death Wish Wow, these photos are really amazing! Who the hell was the model? She's not here anymore, but maybe we?ll find out eventually. Hmm. I really want to know. Is she a fellow student from the same school and grade? How do you feel after showing off the damn photos? I'm not the one who took them. I just publicized your pictures, Mr. Detective. I see. If it were you showing them off yourself, they might have felt sick, but since it was me, they were stunned. A person from a TV station said she'd model. But it's the real thing... Why do you think I didn't make you drink the poison? Because you started to Like me. You're pretty smart. Not as much as you, Mr. Detective. But I'm definitely the most elated right now. It feels smooth, and slippery. It's the peak right now, and I'm just going to keep feeling less and less after this... Well, I think Kazumi would be happy. - Everyone will remember her now. - They'll forget her. No they won't! That's bad reasoning. Are you planning on staying here forever? What did you do with the vibrator? I have it. - Hey, take out the film. - Just keep going. Get the film first! What are you taking pictures of? - The camera has a timer, right? - Yeah. Set it up: we're going to use it. What's with that Look on your face? This kind of lipstick doesn't Look good on you. Is that so? Is this what you wanted to take pictures of? You... Did that lipstick taste good? It was poison. Didn't you want to be together? I don't need you! Because I have this! Hello, it's me. Are you out again? Father, and Kozue, you need to come back here once in a while. This place is your true home, after all. Please do come home. - Have you been well? - Yeah. - I learned the song! The canary forgot how to sing. Shall I beat it with a willow branch? No, no, I would pity the poor thing... - Hey? - Take it. The canary forgot how to sing. Give it an ivory ship, and a silver oar. Let it set sail under the moonlit cover of night, and it'll remember the songs it had forgotten. END Translated by Brolen, Timed by Lord Retsudo
