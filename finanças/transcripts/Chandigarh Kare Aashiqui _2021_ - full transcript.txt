Manu! You goddamned piece of shit! The entire building's shaking! Sorry, Auntie. I'm done now. That was the last one. Even my warning was the last one! Watch it! Why bother sweating it out! Nothing is going to come out of it anyway. Don't say that, man. I'm training my ass off. -I'm going to kill it this time. -Yeah, whatever. You've been saying that for the last two years. Sandy has opened two more gyms… and we're still stuck at one. What are you staring at? Help me! You're such a jinx, Jomo! Always such a pessimist! Wait and watch. Our gym's going to dazzle soon. -"Manu Munjal: G.O.A.T 2019!" -Lift it. Then, all Sandy's clients will be lining up over here. Guys, that Zumba teacher is on her way. We need to make space for her. So, do me a favor and help me out here. Screw Zumba. My clients shouldn't get disturbed. What clients? Bro, we need more business to keep this gym running. Besides, it'll be great to have some pretty girls in here, right? Let some eye candy in, let the good vibes flow. I need to run. Where to, bro? -You skipped your planks! -I'll do them tomorrow. What the hell, Manu! Poor guy's family sucks the life out of him. Catch me if you can! Babbu! You'll hurt yourself! Sit quietly! I'm on a keto diet. Spare me, for God's sake. It's your brother-in-law's birthday. Stop fussing and eat. They're stuffed with paneer and packed with protein. Very healthy bhaturas! These sacks of flour have 470 calories each. Will you do burpees on my behalf? Will you lift some responsibility for a change? You do remember that we run a business, right… where your father slogs his ass all day! Papa… I'm a certified fitness provider. Please look up JustDial. We're listed among the Top 10 gyms in Chandigarh. You mean in Sector 35, right? Yeah, so what? Sector 35 is pretty huge. Really? Tell me, don't your customers pay you? You haven't given me a penny 'til date! I'll return your money. Once I win the G.O.A.T national level competition, sponsors are going to line up. I'll pay every rupee back. Don't you worry. It's you who needs to worry, son. I'm giving you an ultimatum. Either run the family business or return my money. It's high time you settled down. I need a break too. What do you need a break for? To visit the Vaishno Devi temple? I know who's been roasting your kebabs! You're impossible! Must you twist everything into a Hindu-Muslim issue? Stick to the topic! Hello, Papa. How are you, Manu? The poor motherless boy has been toiling day and night! He's trying to stand on his own feet! Can't you be supportive? And what about me? Who is supporting me? I'm a widower too, after all. So am I. My needs are different from yours, Papa. Hey, shut up! Bad manners! Don't discuss such obscenities in front of the children! Listen, son. Goat, Cat, Dog, or Lion, be whatever you want to be… but be quick! Earn lots of money, and throw it in your father's face. Bhatura? Manu Munjal is on stage now. He looks really determined today. Yes! Oh, no! Manu Munjal has lost again! So near, yet so far! This year's G.O.A.T champion is Sandy yet again! Hey, fatty. Did you speak to Nikita? Nikita who? That girl from Bharat Matrimony. I had shown you her profile. Oh, that one. -Why didn't you call her? -I didn't have time. Oh, really? You've turned 30, and you still didn't have time?! Nope. -Give me your password. -Why? I want to check if you deleted her number. Don't you dare snoop into my phone! Stop trying to get me married! I'll find myself a girl. I want to make it big first. Enough is enough! You're already big as a bull! How much bigger do you want to get? Look, Manu. You wasted three years on Mr. Sharma's daughter. She strutted off to Canada leaving you high and dry. When are you going to get on with your life? -Move on, man! -Fatty. There's no other problem, right? You're interested in girls, right? I've had it! Where is my amino supplement, man? Listen up, aminohead! Staring at these musclemen all day has messed up your wiring! Put up photos of some hot actresses. -Like, Kiara Advani, Disha Patani! -Not interested! -Now, get out. Come on. -Why? -We're saying this out of concern. -And I'm saying, get out of my room! -Manu, just listen to me. -Do you want me to kick you out? -You'll kick out your sisters?! -Get out! -What the hell! -You guys are impossible! We'll be back! O pretty lass! O pretty lass! O pretty lass! O pretty lass! You son of a witch! Curse you and your family! You're all going to rot in hell! I'm calling the cops! Sorry about that. Actually, it's the auntie from downstairs. She's old. When the weights fall, she also falls. And then, she just gives us some tough love. I'm Maanvi. Maanvi Brar. I'm supposed to take Zumba classes here. Licensed Zumba instructor. Jumba teacher? Zumba. Welcome. Hi, Maanvi. Sorry. We got a bit late. -This is Riz, and this is Jomo. -Hi. Maanvi.

Manu, you will come inside? -Why are you suddenly talking in English? -Screw that. We need to lock T-shirt designs for the coach's birthday party. Don't worry, bro. Let Chandigarh groove to the Zumba beat. Five, six, seven, eight! Up and down! Stretch! Right! Left! Right! Left! In every city, they're asking, "Who's that girl?" You knock me out with every hip swirl What the heck, bro! In every city, they're asking, "Who's that girl?"

You'll have guys lining up for you. Don't worry, bub. Come on. Let's go for it. Cheers to moving on! Hi, Papa! How are you? I'm great. Zumba classes have begun in full swing. I got my training certificate as well. Finally. Oh, good. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. But sweetheart, do you have to do this job? I mean… is there a money crunch? Papa, please. It's not about money. I need to get out of the house, right? I can't be in my shell for the rest of my life. Fine. Do what makes you happy. By the way… we're coming to Chandigarh next month. Deepa's getting married. That's great news! And you're telling me now?! I could have gone shopping and all. Sorry, am I… am I even invited? Of course, you are! In fact, your uncle said that he'll send you a card. Ma doesn't want me to come, right? No, in fact, she asked me to call and tell you. She's right here. Hey, listen. Let's meet soon. We have tons to catch up on. Alright? You'd better be free, okay? Yeah, Papa. -Okay? -I love you. Love you. Way to go, man! -Hey, Sandy! -Well done! You didn't have to do this. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, COACH Coach. Come on, Sandy. You don't need my blessings. God's always been kind to you. Where's our other warrior prince? Come here. Open your mouth. -Wow, Manu! -Congrats, man!

Practice harder! Anyway, you ought to be the runner-up this time as well! It's okay, man. Ignore him. -Sandy! -Sandy! -Sandy! -Sandy! Manu! I cut my vein! -Are you okay? -No-- What happened? -Riz! Jomo! Is anyone there? -There's nobody. Come, sit! Take it easy! Careful. Our cleaner also ran away. Water, please. -The blood's going into my nose. -Give it to me. Relax. -It's not a fracture, right? -No. Sure? -Your nose might turn crooked-- -No! Don't say that. I can't have a crooked nose. It's a minor injury. Just keep your head back, and no weights for a week. I have a competition to win, ma'am. Thank you, doctor. -Shall we? -Yeah. Come. -Careful. -How can I rest? The competition's coming up. Shall we talk about that later? I'll drop you off at home first. No, I'll manage. Don't worry. You've shown enough courage for the day. I'm free all day now anyway. I missed my Zumba class. -One second. Wait here, alright? -You missed your class for me?! -Auto! -Sorry. Are you okay? Accident? No. It's nothing. Hey, handsome! How's it going? -I'm good. -What happened to your nose, sweetie? I injured myself. Oh. Looks like Lady Luck's smiling on you. Show the pretty lady how generous you are. Loosen up your purse. Come on! Such a lovely pair! May your love bloom forever! Hey, hero! You can stop here. Thank you. -See you tomorrow. -Okay. -Bye, take care. -Bye. Manu! -Are you okay? -Yes, almost. Come, I'll walk you home. Careful. Manu! What happened to you? -It's nothing. Continue your prayers. -Hey! Naveen! Naveen! -Coming, Papa! -Hey-- At least, tell me, how was the pudding? -I'll call you later. -Naveen! Did someone die, or what? Leave everything and come here. It's urgent. You injured yourself again?! Lifting weights at the gym every day like a mule! I keep telling him-- Hello, miss. Hello. Hey, won't you introduce us? Yeah. This is Maanvi. She teaches Zumba at our gym. That's my papa. -Namaste, sir. -Namaste. And there, behind you, is my good old grandpa. Hello. God bless you! Nice. Dear… are you from Chandigarh? -No. -I mean, are your parents based here? No, they stay in Ambala. Papa was a brigadier in the army. He's retired now. Oh! You're a soldier's daughter?! Long live India! Long live our soldiers! O motherland, I salute thee! Papa, control yourself. So, you guys met at the gym! Manu didn't tell us anything. Enough, Papa. Is this an interrogation? Don't interrupt your elders. -Grandpa! What's the emergency? -Manu! Oh, God! Fatty! What happened? Did you hurt yourself with a dumbbell? These are my sisters. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello! -Hi. -Have we met before? -No, I just joined the gym-- Don't you have to go? Yeah. -I'll drop you-- -No, you please rest! -The auto's waiting outside. -Are you sure? -You take care, get rest. -See you tomorrow. Please have something before you go, at least! -Naveen! -Some other time. Yeah. Please wait. Bye, Manu! -But-- -Bye! -She'll find her way. -Okay, I guess. Wow, fatty! What a relief, seriously! She was so pretty! No wonder you didn't talk to Nikita! When were you going to tell us? Tell you what? She's a friend. We're just good friends, okay? Right, just "good friends!" Drop the act already! Don't jump the gun. If anything happens, I'll tell you on my own. Hey! Why are you being so shy? You used to pee in my lap as a kid. Remember? Enough now, or I'll do it again. FOR TODAY YOU ARE WELCOME, FATTY. WHEN? What's the problem with meeting him? Give the guy a chance. Everyone's not the same. He's just called you for lunch. -How's it going? -Good. -Please sit. -Yes. Yeah, here. -Manu Munjal's on stage now. -Your order, ma'am? He looks really determined today. You're so good! You were almost there! …has lost again! I mean… that's very impressive. I had almost won. That Sandy came in last minute and psyched me out. He's always been a scoundrel. Why don't you try out Zumba for a few days? Jumba? Me? I'm a bodybuilder, not a peacock. My reputation in the market will go for a toss. It's not dancing, it's Zumba. Your flexibility will increase. It'll help you with your squats. Just a suggestion. I've got a great physiotherapist. I always go all out with my squats anyway. Thank you. -Enjoy your meal, sir. -Sure, will do. Oh, sorry. I start intermittent fasting after 7:00 p.m. I've got to have 150 grams of protein before that. Yeah, please go ahead. Don't notice me. I've got to win the G.O.A.T competition this year. If I don't, hell will break loose. At home, at the gym. -I-- -Why take so much pressure? Well… you have no clue what my family's like! Why? They seemed pretty cute to me. They just look cute. They're a bunch of thugs. Seriously! I mean, they do love me a lot. I accept that. But they poke their nose into everything. What's your scene, by the way? Well… I'm the only child. Papa means everything to me. He's my rock. My mom… we don't get along much. Why? Well… she can't accept who I am. I don't believe you. You're such a sorted girl. I know, right? Thanks. But she doesn't think so. How is that possible? Tell me. Come on. Never mind. -You don't have to if it's awkward. -Good evening. I don't talk to anyone about my mother either. Why? It hurts. -I was 13 when she died. -Oh, no. I'm so sorry, I didn't-- I had not eaten for two days. I had slipped into depression. Then I got an eating disorder and turned into a balloon. At school, in the streets, everyone would bully me. That's when I decided that… I'd become a bodybuilder. I joined the gym right then. When I lift the barbell… and those veins pop out, it gives me a high like no other. It's like a divine experience. Hey, easy! I still think you should take my advice. Do some Zumba until the competition. You'll thank me later. Are you always so wound up? Tight clothes, tight dreams. Let your muscles breathe a little. They'll thank you. So, tell me, what music do you like? Punjabi! Five, six, seven, eight! Roll and roll! Very nice! Back straight. Come, I'll show you. Round… Nice. Okay, guys! One, two, three, four! Roll! Roll your shoulders! Hi! Hi! -Can we join you? -Yeah, of course! You're a Zumba queen! You're such a good teacher! -Thank you. -Knock on wood. May God protect you from the evil eye! -We'll come daily now. -Okay. -Cool! -I'll see you soon then. -Okay, take care. God bless you. -Bye. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Where is Manu? What were they saying? God bless, knock on wood… stuff like that. -Why? -No, it's nothing. -What's up? -Nothing. Say. -Now they'll shout from the rooftops. -Shout what? They think something is cooking between us. So, tell them there's nothing. What's the problem? The problem is that they're like the CBI agents. Once they're at it, they'll sniff the truth-- How's this one? Hey! Maanvi! Where are you lost? If you didn't want to come here, you could've told me. It's not like that. It's very hot. Your girl's going to go crazy. Why are you overthinking it? I don't know, really. What if it ends up the same way? If you say that again, I'll murder you. It's just a Holi party, not a proposal! Relax. So, should I go? Sir! Can I get a knife? Okay, fine. I won't say it again. Excuse me, can we get two of these, please? Bras before bros, am I right? Come on! Come on, tiger! Kill it! That's it! Now, keep it down! Very good, man! Well done! Awesome, bro! -More sets, come on! -Hi, Manvinder. Send me the address. I'll be there. -When is Holi? -When is Holi? Hey, lover Hear the birds sing And the anklet-bells ring What should I do, my love? How should I fight Against this cruel world? What should I do, my love? Girls gotta chug-hug-chug-chug!

It's such a distraction What is this attraction? It's such a distraction My heart goes Slowly slowly, pitter-patter Trails in vain, sighs so close Whisk my breath away before you go Your sweet nothings draw me in 'Til I can't hold back anymore Yeah, I'm losing control Your sweet scent draws me close 'Til it engulfs me wholly Yeah, I'm losing control What is this attraction?

What is this attraction? What is this attraction? Where are you? Good morning. Morning. You're something else, man! A class apart. Eat up before it's time for your fasting. I think I'm in love. Madly in love. Will you marry me? What happened? This isn't just a fling for me. I'm serious. I'm also serious. Then? You think I won't fit in with your classy folks? I'll spruce up my English, and my Zumba too. With a capital Z. It's not that, Manu. I-- There is something else. What else? I'll adopt the three kids from your previous marriage. No problem. What else? Manu. I'm… I'm a trans girl. What? What's that? -I wasn't always like this. -Then what were you like? I was born a boy… but I was always a girl inside. I lived a lie for 20 years. I hated myself. I fought many battles. I even left my home. Then, six years ago, I finally got my surgery and became on the outside who I always was on the inside. Inside, outside, surgery… what's all this? What are you talking about? As a kid, my name wasn't Maanvi. It was Manu… Manu Brar. That's not possible. You can't show me some random photo and-- I don't believe you. That day, on Holi, I wanted to tell you. I tried, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. I did. You're a dude, Maanvi?! That was just my body. -Then who's this? -This is when I was him. This is what I used to look like. Him-her, he-she… my brain's about to explode! You've cheated me! I had sex with a man?! I had sex with a man! Oh, God! Kill me now! Forgive me, God. So much sex. -I'm not a boy. -So much! I want to throw up! I'm not a man. Can't you hear what I'm saying? Shut up! Spare me the fancy English! If I let myself go, I'll destroy you! Out. Get out of here! -Get out! -This is my house. Your house, right. I'll… -Manu, please. -I had sex with a man. At least, hear me out. -Had I lost it? -Manu. -I had sex with a man. -Manu. Actually, wait. Not a man. You're not even a man. Manu. You won't get away with this. I'm going to ruin your life. You have no idea what I'm capable of. Trans girl… what does it mean? Is she into trance music? No, man. She was a guy before. Then she got surgery, and… -Surgery? As in? -That kind of surgery. Holy shit! Our Maanvi? Her name isn't Maanvi. It's Manu. Manu Brar. Damn, bro. So, you literally screwed yourself?! -How did you not realize it? -Did either of you jackasses realize it? Weren't you staring at her every day? Don't get mad, bro. He means to say… you drove the car, but you didn't even check under the hood?! How could you not realize it despite having sex? Sex. The sex was great, man. Normal. Better than normal. -From where did you do it? -What the-- You moron! Are you nuts? I did it the way everyone does! You both are going to die virgins! Normal?! Normal! I don't know what to do now. What do you mean? We'll go teach him a lesson! What does he think of himself? Is there no law and order in this country? Bloody eunuch! Manu… she's here. Go, tell her. This Ram Aur Shyam act won't cut it here! Not Ram Aur Shyam, bro. It's Seeta Aur Geeta. No, dude. It's like Seeta and Shyam. Manu, can we talk for five minutes, please? Say whatever you want to in front of my friends. I won't talk to you alone. If we could just sit and talk… at least, let me explain myself properly. Good morning, Miss Maanvi. We've practiced the steps that you taught us yesterday. So, should we show it to you? Holy hell! She looks exactly like a girl! No one can tell that she's a eunuch. Will you stop using that word? Her name's Maanvi! Maanvi! Alright? A boy can't become a girl just by changing his name. If I change my name from Jomo to Jamila, will I become a girl? I'll turn you into Jamila! Should I? -Manu, let go of him! -You'd better stop it! -Have you lost it? -Watch your tongue! Let go of him! Let go! What the heck, bro! I'll beat you to a pulp! Now say eunuch again! -Eunuch. -You asshole! -Her name's Maanvi! -Let go of him! Sis, why is Manu fighting? I won't spare you! Manu! -Bloody lowlife, I will-- -Stop it! Why are you fighting like cats and dogs? Why do you care? Go, dance. Make merry. Leave me alone. Hey! What's going on? Why were you fighting? It's nothing, sister. We were just doing MMA practice. Bro got a bit too carried away. You've got to take it easy, bro! One could get hurt. Please continue with your class. Zumba and all. Maanvi! She's calling you. Outside. Do you want to quit the competition? Then you can eat all day like a pig. -Get me another glass of lassi. -Yes. With extra cream on top. -Cancel it. -Shut up. I'm really sorry, man. Forgive me, please. Please don't be mad at me. Then what should I do? Jump off a cliff? Look, bro. What's done is done. It's all good. Whatever your preference is, we'll support you. To each his own! What? What do you mean? Look, bro. You can try out this homo option if you want. There's this amazing app called Grindr. You'll find many hot guys on it. No one's going to bother you. Times have changed. You're free to do it however and with whomever you want. I should've told him earlier. I thought he'll understand. I don't know why. Hello! Hold on! Should you go around wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm a trans girl"? He's the one who came running after you. But that's what always happens. I like someone. Someone likes me. And then again… Stop going on a pointless guilt trip. Don't worry about all these things. What guilt trip? She's happily chomping on a pizza. You have a competition coming up in 15 days. Do you want to say something? Can we talk elsewhere? There are families around here. Why? Are you scared they'll find out? That you'll be publicly humiliated? Hey, stud! Take it easy, okay? I'm not talking to you, bro. -I'll thrash you so hard-- -Akshi, it's okay. I got this. Shall we? -Are you sure? -Yeah. What are you doing? You're hurting me! And what about you hurting me? -Forget hurt, you screwed me over! -Please mind your language. How about you mind your actions! What did I ever do to you? Did I ever touch you, hurt you even a little bit? Then why? Why did you lie to me? You're a bloody cheater! You wanted sex, right? Why me? You could've gone and screwed anyone else! I am not a gigolo! What do you mean I could've screwed anyone? Get to the point. Oh, really? Do you have the guts to hear it? I've been hearing shit from people ever since I was a kid. You're not the first man to do it. I'm not a man, I'm a frigging jackass! I've been having sex with a man. Will you please stop saying that? -Don't shout! -Why shouldn't I? You shoot your mouth off like a jackass, and I should keep quiet?! Well, if I'm a jackass, I'll talk like one, alright? What do you want from me? I want you to leave this city. Stay out of Chandigarh's borders, got it? Take your ugly, manly face and get lost! What? Did that hurt? If it feels so awful to hear, imagine how it feels to have touched you. You goddamned-- Don't you dare touch me, I'll rip you to shreds! Weren't you in love with this manly face? I was a class apart, right? You were besotted! Yeah, I had lost my marbles! I'm back to my senses now! I don't want to get caught up in this trans-homo crap! I want a normal-- Hey, listen to me! I want everything normal. Normal sex, a normal life-- I'm a normal guy, alright? Normal! It all boils down to sex for you ultimately, right? -Is that all you care about? -Of course not! But you just wanted sex, didn't you? -That's why you lied-- -I didn't lie about anything. I just didn't tell you about my past. What should I do now? Hang myself? How many times should I say sorry? Should I fall at your feet? What's the use? My life's ruined now. You uncouth prick! What have you lost? How's your life ruined? Okay, even if I wanted sex… didn't you enjoy it too? And if you want normal sex with a normal girl, then go ahead! Why are you here? Don't try this stunt with me again, okay? If you want to act tough, then so can I! You have no idea whom you're messing with. One scratch on your nose, and you were howling like a baby. Imagine what I have cut off and what my body has endured. Think of the pain I must have gone through. So, now, nothing scares me anymore. Show me what you've got. Bring it on. Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right! Left and stretch! Do stretch! Enough of this drag show! Throw her out right now! Manu… we were just going over our accounts. The profits this quarter are killer, bro. Anyway, she has a three-month contract, right? Let her stay a while longer. What are you saying, bro? Is it business over friendship now? Try to understand. It's your own gym. We've got so many clients after a long time. And they're all extremely happy with Maanvi. Jomo's right, Manu. Keep personal and professional matters separate. Don't you want to make it big like Sandy? Sandy can screw himself! To hell with him and his gym chain! I don't want to be like him. Be reasonable, Manu. If we throw Maanvi out, people will raise a ruckus. And your sisters… they'll be at our throats. What will you do then? Look, man. They all look so happy. Have some patience. He is getting it. Yes! -Here you go! Piping hot kulchas! -Give it to me. -Here, Grandpa. -Pass me the butter. -Butter, please. -There you go. Oh, butter. -Yes, please give it to me. -Here. Manu, have some. How's Maanvi, son? Why? Do you also have something to say? Not at all, son. In fact, I'm really happy. Love has knocked on your door for the first time. Now just wait and see how it transforms your life. What's with this sudden poetic talk? Just get to the point! Look, Manu. Once you get married, it'll pave the way for my love story as well. Unbelievable, man! Everyone's busy making their own damned movie! No one cares about me. Who's stopping you from chasing your dreams? Marry Maanvi. You could also move in with her. Your father's a progressive man now. Ever since Tasneem has entered my life, I've changed-- Papa, don't fire your gun off my shoulder. It's been 17 years since your mother died. How long must I stay alone-- -What kind of a father are you? -A practical one! I've turned 55 selling toilet seats. I won't get another chance. Help your father out! Then you will be happy, your sisters will be happy, your grandpa will be satisfied, and I'll be free. I want one more! You'll ruin your teeth. -Go. -Thank you! Give me two more. Once you and Maanvi get engaged, only then will we be at peace. Whatever you're thinking is not going to happen! What won't happen? Forget about Maanvi. She's not my type. What do you mean? You go to the gym together, chat on WhatsApp all night. We know everything! You don't get it. We aren't compatible. She's a very different kind of girl. We belong to different worlds. Look, Manu. When two hearts unite, every gap can be bridged. How should I make you understand? -Are you having problems in the bedroom? -As in? As in, why are you so frustrated? You were fighting with Jomo at the gym too. Whatever the issue is, say it openly! Now we're not only your sisters but also your mother. -Speak up! Is it a bedroom problem? -I don't know! I'll give you a doctor's number. He'll turn you from a donkey to a racehorse in a month. Let's go, my horse! Manu, don't give up so easily. You won't find a better girl than Maanvi. What about Nikita, the girl from Bharat Matrimony? Why shop at a dollar store when you can wear couture! If you must dream, dream of Gucci and Armani. She's beautiful and well-spoken. You look great together. -Go, talk to her! -Yes! We want to meet her parents. -Sis, can I get a hankie? -Do you have a hankie? What you'll get is a tight slap! Silly man-child! Maanvi! Hey, listen to me! Maanvi. Look, don't create a scene here. It's a residential area. I'm in no position to create a scene. I'm royally screwed. My family's gone nuts. They want to meet your parents. They're saying-- Can you please tell them that there's nothing between us? -Why don't you tell them yourself? -No one listens to me! I'm like a junior artist in my own film. My family's hell-bent on getting us married. Just reject me once, and this mess will be over. And on what basis should I reject you? Say whatever you like. It doesn't matter. You can say that I'm down-market, a wastrel, a loser… a total failure! That I scam people by selling fake protein supplements. Tell them that you have higher standards, that you're out of my league. But I didn't reject you. You're the one who rejected me. Why are you screwing me up, man? Just say no and get over with it. Your family, your problem. You tell them. Tell them what? That I dated a eunu-- Sorry. I mean, please forgive me. Sorry. Go, tell them the truth. Tell them that I'm a trans girl and I took advantage of you. Your problem will be solved. No one will bother you. -Come on, that's crazy. -Why? You hated that I lied, right? Then go and tell them the truth. In fact, I'll do it. Let's end this story. -Wait-- -Don't! Don't touch me. What's going on? What happened, ma'am? Is this man bothering you? -No… -No, sir. It's the opposite. Actually, I've wronged him. I was born a boy. I got the surgery done and became a girl. -What? -I took advantage of him. Now he's horrified and traumatized. And completely humiliated. It's a case of cheating and attempted rape, sir. Have you lost it, ma'am? She's a bit crazy. Don't take her seriously. It's our internal matter, we'll sort it out. Did I ask for your opinion? Look, sir. It's just a silly lovers' tiff. Don't waste your time on us. Go, catch some real crooks. Hey, hulk! Don't preach to the Pope! Back off! Ma'am, you seem to be from a good family. Whatever your issues are, please resolve them at home. -Yeah. -Don't create a scene outside! Yes, sir. And listen, tough guy! You'd better drop her off at home now! -Got it? -Yes, sir. Come on, now get going! Are you out of your mind? This isn't your hometown. Don't mess around with the cops here. You could end up in jail all night. So? Why are you bothered? I was telling the truth, right? What should I do with you! Oh, God! Fine. You don't need to do anything. Just spare me. Do you know what the problem is? You can't stomach the truth, and I can't end the charade. Go away, Manu. Leave me alone. I'm all alone As my tears flow endlessly Your love has cut me open Our chords are now all broken I'm all alone As my tears flow endlessly Your love has cut me open Our chords are now all broken Ever since you left me My life's bereft of beauty Away from you, even if I survive What good is this life Without you beside me? I am meant to be who I am, and I am a girl. I was born in the wrong body. Millions of people, like myself, are fighting on a daily basis, not for your tolerance, but for your acceptance. I was severely bullied and nobody really understood me. I thought that I'm going to end up alone. I'm not going to live this life, I'm not going to hide myself, I want to be a beautiful girl! I was born a boy… but I was always a girl inside. Your love was measured, part for part Your love was measured, part for part If only you had treasured my heart My face won't hide behind a veil -My soul has lived to tell its tale -You're not even a man! Get this manly face of yours out of here! You've cheated me! Manu. I'm going to ruin your life. I'm all alone As my tears flow endlessly Your love has cut me open Our chords are now all broken My face won't hide behind a veil My soul has lived to tell its tale You'll never know You wouldn't care Even if it breaks me I'll still be there I'm all alone As my tears flow endlessly Your love has cut me open Hi, my baby! How are you? Good. What did you tell Ma? That I'm going to the club to meet some friends. -And she believed you?! -Who cares? Am I not allowed to meet my own daughter? We live in a democracy, after all. Take this. It's for you. I've got you some patisa as well. Your favorite. Thank you. I'll open it later. Come, see the house first. Yeah, sure. Nice! You've done it up beautifully. Calls for a celebration! Isn't it a bit too early for a drink? Who cares? Tonight, father and son will bond over drinks. Daughter. You're my son and daughter, both. What happened? Why do you look so sad? You can tell me. I'm your papa. Why don't you stop going to the gym for a few days? It might help both of you. Why must I always have to leave? I left my school, my home, my city, and now, I have to leave the gym. I don't want to run away anymore. I am what I am, and… I'm not ashamed of it. Why should you be ashamed of it? In fact, you should be proud of yourself. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of my daughter. Only one thing worries me. You're fighting these battles all by yourself… while I'm far off in Ambala, unable to be there for you. You're always with me, Papa. That's how I find the strength to fight my battles. Enough fighting now. I just want to see you happy now. You will. Very soon. Love you. Love you too. Hey, sweetie! Don't be stingy! May you get a beautiful wife! Come on, now hand me a crisp note! Hey, muscleman! What's up? -Listen-- -Why are you following me? Will you have coffee with me? Look, hero! Take a hike! Scoot! Can we please just talk once? Stop annoying me! Get lost! I just want to talk to you, sister! That's it! It's a matter of life and death. Please? Let's go. So, this is a love triangle… Manu, Maanvi, and Manu. Look, buddy. You like her, right? She cares for you, she looks after you. She shares your joys and sorrows. And you're happy when you're with her, right? You have fun too. Right? What else do you want? Maanvi seems to be from a nice family. And she's lucky to have got her operation done at the right time. Then what's stopping you? You think it's weird to fall in love with a trans girl! You know what Shakespeare said, right? "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." I'm a BA in English. Here's my two cents in Hindi. Take it or leave it. Labels can take a hike. Gay, bi, uni, trans… what difference does it make? Love is love! To hell with the world! I'll tell you what… I know one doctor. You just go and meet her. The heck did I just see! Meet, pick up the phone! He was on a coffee date with a eunuch! A eunuch! I nearly died of shock! Oh, God! I'm hot on her trail, sis. I'll keep you posted. But where's Manu now? Riz-Jomo picked him up. God knows where they're taking him. My goodness! Meet! That's it! Stop the auto! Yeah, I'm keeping watch. Meet, they're going into a mental hospital! Sis, Maanvi has also entered some clinic. What's going on, Meet? Why is everyone going to see doctors? Find out! I'm on it, sis. Hello, Mr. Munjal. How can I help you? -Maanvi, right? -Yes. How have you been? Sushma, take her to Dr. Kaur. -Thank you. -Thank you. You both are normal adults and sexually compatible as well. But ma'am, she was a boy, and I've seen those pictures. Our minds determine our gender, Mr. Munjal… not our bodies. Maanvi may have been born in a male body, but in her heart, mind, and soul, she was always a woman. God made a mistake, and Maanvi corrected it. Simple! Mission canceled, Meet! I repeat, mission canceled! Fatty's in danger! Just meet me at the gym! But what happened? Just meet me at the gym, goddammit! My head is spinning! God, help us! If you're interested, I can give you literature about transgenders. But to be honest, Mr. Munjal… what you need now isn't research material but courage. The same courage that Maanvi displayed when she took such a brave step. Manu. What's going on with you? What's going on? You didn't think twice before flushing our family's reputation down the toilet! If not me, you could've at least thought about your grandfather. I don't want to miss out on anything before I breathe my last. You can see what you want on social media. Tell us. Didn't you already know everything? What? You knew all about Maanvi, didn't you? Speak up! Answer Papa. Did you really not know? So, you knew. And you still went around shamelessly romancing with that… that thing?! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Are you really comparing me with him? If our country wasn't divided by religion, I would've-- Stick to the topic, Papa. How is this Manu's fault? That witch must have seduced him with black magic. No wonder my right eye has been twitching ever since I saw her! But never mind. We've sorted it all out now. Manu! What are you here for? Actually… the coach's been calling Manu. Why is your phone switched off? You're not going anywhere. Sit quietly at home. We've organized a prayer meet for you. Manu. Manu! Manu! Manu, listen to me! Will you say something? What happened? Bro, the shit hit the fan. Maanvi… Come, we'll start with the class. No one will move! What did you think? You'll speak fancy English, put lipstick and makeup, wear fashionable clothes, and we'll welcome you into our family? Did you think that a eunuch can become the Munjals' daughter-in-law? Adam in the sheets and madam on the streets?! Right? Students, let's-- We'll start the class. What class? What students? Guys… what's going on? Will you say something? What can they say? They own this gym, not the whole colony! This is a place for families and decent folks! Got it? Miss Maanvi, please don't go. Frankly, Maanvi, we don't care about any of this. You should just cushion your baby brother in a blanket. Have you never seen a girl before? All this happened and you just kept mum?! Man, the situation got too one-sided. -What could we have done? -What do you mean? -You should've thrown them out! -They're your sisters, dude. Did you think that a eunuch can become the Munjals' daughter-in-law? Man, this video's gone viral. Adam in the sheets and madam on the streets?! Everyone's sharing it, man. Sandy even commented on it. Screw this. Don't read it. Read it, Riz. I want to hear it. "Exposed at the gym! Never judge a chick by her cover, Munjal." He's also tagged Maanvi. He's written, "One and a half men!" -Stop the car! -What? I said, stop the car! -Bro, let's go and work out. -Screw working out! Stop the car! Manu, where-- Where are you going, bro? Manu! The competition's tomorrow, man! Where are you going, bro? Stop calling me! Who? Ajit who? Yeah, tell me. Yeah, I'm home. What's the matter? What?! When? And you're telling me now?! Which hospital is he in? -Navjot. -Yes? -That's our Manu, right? -What happened? How's Papa? The operation's underway. Hello. -Hi, Ajit. -Hi. What did the doctors say? It was a massive heart attack. They had to operate urgently. How did this happen all of a sudden? Everyone was together, dancing and celebrating. Uncle drank a bit too much. He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest and collapsed. We immediately admitted him to this hospital. He's been in for two hours. We just have to wait. If Ajit wasn't around today… God knows what would have happened! Manu… you were such a handsome boy. -What happened to you suddenly? -My name is Maanvi. Manu's dead. Didn't Mom tell you? Yeah, don't worry. I've packed everything. If anything's left, I'll come by again. Yeah, okay. I'm on my way. -Okay, bye. -Maanvi! Please let me speak to Maanvi once. I'll do whatever you say then. Where is she? -Get lost before I thrash you! -Hey! Please, bro. Just help me this one time. I'll be indebted to you for life. Please? Here, dear. Coffee. Hi, Auntie. Manu, you used to have big biceps, didn't you? What happened to them? I had them removed and put them somewhere else. Somewhere else? Where? Did you think that a eunuch can become the Munjals' daughter-in-law? Adam in the sheets and madam on the streets?! Maanvi. -How's Uncle? -He's still in the OT. He insisted on tagging along, kept pleading like a puppy. Maanvi… -What the hell is he doing here? -At least, hear him out. I don't want to! I've heard enough! -We'll sort it out later-- -I don't want to! Hello, sir. I'm Manu. Maanvi's friend. Hello. Hello, Grandma. God bless you, son. How's Grandpa? He passed away in 1992, son. I'm just living with his memories now. She's not with us. She's another patient. So, are you an old friend of hers? Of Maanvi's? Yes, sir. Is Maanvi's father okay? He'll be fine. The entire family's here to look after him. Only near and dear ones are allowed here. Thank you. Who is this hulk? Is he a goon? Or your boyfriend? And that sidekick… is that a boy or a girl? These are your friends?! Why are they here? It's a free country. People can go wherever they want. Maybe they care about me. It's possible for someone to actually care about me, right? Stop playing the victim. It's thanks to you that your father is in this condition. What do you mean? He drinks so much out of worry for you. Wow. How conveniently you've shifted the blame on me! You should be in politics. That is the truth… whether you accept it or not. Now please leave. And take these freaks with you. I'm not going anywhere until Papa's out of the OT. How much more will you embarrass us, Manu? What's this flag of honor that I must uphold? Until when will you play this card? You're too ashamed to even call me by my name. My name is Maanvi. Maanvi, Ma. I'm your daughter. -Not that you were born as one. -I was always your daughter. I didn't decide to be a girl on a whim overnight. How many times do I need to explain, how many doctors do I need to take you to? I've always seen you as the ultimate woman since I was a child. I always looked up to you. I was starving for your affection. Would it hurt so much if only once… you accepted me as your daughter? Whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm your child, am I not? Now stop shedding tears and creating a scene. Your father's already in the OT. I don't want any more stress. Hey… it's okay. Don't worry. Are you a bodyguard, son? No, I'm a sportsman. -I see! -I run my own gym in Sector 35. Your physique led me to think that you're a bodyguard. They're quite in demand these days, right? Even bodyguards are becoming celebrities now. Mrs. Brar. The operation was successful. He's still not out of danger. Therefore, we've put him under observation. Can we meet him? No. Not yet. By the way, who's Maanvi? He keeps taking her name. -Please call her if she's not around. -She's right here. That's Maanvi, doctor. Brigadier Brar's daughter. -Okay. -Come forward. -Hello. -Hi. You can go see him inside… but from a distance. And no talking please, okay? He needs complete and absolute rest. Okay? -Thank you, doc. -You're welcome. There's only one attendant allowed with the patient at night. So, the rest of you, please… I'll stay here with Uncle. -You all can go home. -I'll stay. No, it's alright. I can. Ajit… I'm his only child. I'll stay. Call us if there's any problem. Don't try and be a hero on your own. She's not alone. I'm here with her. But why? Are you Shah Rukh Khan? No, sir. I'm her bodyguard. -Let's go. -Come on. Hey. Do you want me to stay? No, you go. I'll message you. -Sure? -Yeah. Should I take him away? I really don't care. Okay, fine. Just take care, okay? You'd better behave. Maanvi! Maanvi, please listen to me. Just two minutes! I just came here to say sorry. -Whatever my sisters did-- -Was unforgivable. What else? You're right. It was unforgivable. But I swear on my mother's soul… I didn't tell them anything. I know. You don't have the courage. Go, focus on your competition. It's tomorrow, right? Then why are you here? Go, train. Be a man. Be the G.O.A.T. How can I claim to be the G.O.A.T when I couldn't even protect your honor? I can protect my own honor. You wanted me out of your life, right? I'm gone now. Let's go our own ways. -Don't say that, Maanvi-- -Leave me alone. Thank you. What do you want? Why are you here? Where should I go? What should I do? My head's been spinning ever since you told me. It's not my fault. I'm from a government school. I had never even heard the word "trans" before. It just hit me like a brick! It's not a small deal for a guy like me, Maanvi. It takes time to sink in. But now, I understand that there's nothing to be understood here. All that matters… is that I really like you, Maanvi. Very, very much. I used to be a boy. Have you forgotten that? That boy doesn't exist for me! I don't even know him, I've never met him! The person you are today… is the one I truly like. You're bloody amazing the way you are. In fact, you're the real G.O.A.T. You're a rock star! I really miss you. Everything feels pointless without you. Whether it's keto or training. I feel low all the time. Even my biceps have shrunk. Look. These are just empty words. You won't be able to hold my hand and face the world. No chance I'll let go of you now. Just one chance… that's all I'm asking for. People will taunt you. Your life may never be normal again. Normal! What's normal? Tell me! You think my life's normal? I'm over 32, and I'm still not married. I had one long-term girlfriend who ran off with the neighbor's son! My father's having a secret affair. I have two batshit, crazy sisters. I have pimples on my chest, thanks to all those protein supplements! Normal? Normal is just a matter of perspective. Normal can go screw itself! Sorry, I got carried away. All I want to say is that… I really like being with you. That's what I feel. Do you feel it too? Yes… or no? Manu! What have you come to say now? That if I don't leave Maanvi, you'll disown me? I don't care. Try something new. You disgrace! For the sake of your mother's soul… get inside the car right now! That's my boy! Come on! Better late than never! We'll find you an original girl. We don't want a Chinese knockoff. Damn right! Come, let's go home! -Manu! -Manu! Manu, stop! Manu! -Oh, my God! -Hey! Manu, stop! Go home and watch your daily soaps! -Dad! -Read your gossip magazines! Gorge on crackers and pickles! Let loose and make merry! But for God's sake, leave me alone! What are you-- This whole family is bloody cursed! What the hell is your problem? Weren't you all floored by Maanvi before? Like, she was covered in gold dust! Beautiful, classy, well-spoken, and all that. And now, suddenly, she's rotten? You'll ruin your life, Manu! It's my life, I'll figure it out! What do you mean? Do your family and its blessings count for nothing? You want to talk about family? Grandma had a mustache. She was family too, right? Did you stop loving her? Go, Papa. Go, live your life. You're 55 already. You won't get another chance. Love is love, goddammit! Go, bring our new mom home. New mom?! No one's stopped you. You're just stopping yourself. Papa, don't even think about it! We're already a laughing stock. Our home will turn into a circus! Papa… what are you thinking about? Do me a favor. Catch a rickshaw. -What? -What? -Get off! -Fine! Come on, Meet! Come on, Meet. Papa's also lost it. Now, it's all in our hands. -Let's go. -But what should we do? We'll talk to Grandpa, what else! She is going to create a rift in our family, I'm telling you! Maanvi. I've got to go. I have to be with Papa. Life's no good without you beside me Your absence leaves a void inside me Come to me this instance I can't bear this distance I bow at your feet With folded hands I lie in your wake I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm a changed man, you'll see I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm a changed man, you'll see Your heart is clear as water So pristine and pure Yet, I never looked within Couldn't understand your soul I was hypnotized By your kohl-stained eyes But I never looked inside Never looked into your soul Should've known from the start That I can't bear to be apart I bow at your feet With folded hands I lie in your wake I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm a changed man, you'll see GREATEST OF ALL TIME 2019-2020 Ladies and gentlemen!
