I think I made a mistake. Of course you did! No, it's just that my fiancée has the same dress, just like yours. - Yeah, you bet. Right. - Believe me! - I'm serious. It's the same dress. - Look, leave now or you'll get slapped. Well, she's not really my fiancée, but... Oh, Fede! Uh... See? What did I tell you? Look. You won't believe what just happened. - As you can see... - I saw it. - Oh! - Go fuck yourself, Dante! I told you if you didn't leave, you'd get slapped, didn't I? Yeah. You should go after her. You think so? Look, I'm... sorry, okay? I'm sorry about this thing that happened. I don't... Can I buy you a drink to mend it? It's an open bar. Oh, I'll buy you two then. [chuckling] Uh, Dante.

It took me two hours to make it! [Alice humming] Alice, come on. I'm gonna be late. There's no way I'm not making pancakes for your birthday. - Oh. - It's tradition. Yeah, I get it, but it's... it's... I'm really late for work. [humming "Happy Birthday"] There you go. It's ready. Wait a second! It's really hot! You have to count at least to ten. One, two, three... [faster] Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! - No, no, no! - Um... Eleven, 12, 13, 14... - [Alice] When will you be back? - I don't know. - I have to bring this box to my dad. - But why today? Um... Well, I'll go on my lunch break, okay? Bye. [sentimental music plays] [tires squeal] [horn honks] [tires squeal] [tires squeal] [tires screech] [parking brake clicks] [grunts] SACKS INSURANCE - Hi. Good morning! - Hey. Dante, people from Armadio are coming. - The contract's ready, right? - Yeah, sure. [woman] I'll send the reports. - Was it today? - I sent you an e-mail. - Ah, Dante... - Huh? Happy birthday. Thank you. [keyboard clacking] LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHILE YOU ARE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS [doorbell rings] [horn blows] - Waka waka. - I told you not to bring anything. As my grandpa used to say, "The least you can do is show up at parties with the alcohol you think you're gonna be drinking." [phone rings] Sh, sh, sh, sh! It's him! Oh! We're finally gonna drink! Yay! - Are you on your way? - Uh, I still have to stop at my dad's. [Alice] You said you'd go at lunch. [Dante] I know, but I forgot I had a meeting today. I'll be quick. I'll bring him the box and... [Dante] Excuse me. There you go. All your stuff. - I found it during the move. - Thank you. Look. - How wonderful. - Dad. Listen, I'm gonna... This sailing ship, look how beautiful it is. Put it over there. Done. Ooh! Look! Here's my hat. Amazing. Ooh! You've been pestering me about this hat for two months. And you even said I stole it from you. - Come on. - Who? I wasn't talking about this particular hat. I had lots of hats, because I've lived at sea a lot of years. Tell me, do you understand? I'd throw you in the sea in a flash. Be smarter. Uh, does it seem normal to you that I pay her to treat me like this? - [Dante] Oh, you pay her? - Fine. [Dante] Since when you do that? - Someone came to stay here. It was a lady. - [Dante] Um... Her name is Rosa. A really nice lady. So elegant. Widow, of course. Passionate about art. So much that she was willing to talk to me about artists and painters for two hours. She mentioned names that I didn't even know. - But I like how beautiful she talks. - [Dante] Hmm. She has this voice, uh, so, uh, delicate, ethereal. She also has a nice ass, and at 63, that's almost impossible. - You're right. But I wanted to... - Help me hang it. Come on. [sighs] - And I have to tell you, I would love to... - Here we go. Well, maybe... The hat is in the wall. Bye, Dad. If you find yourself passing by that... [door opens] - [phone rings] - Yes? [man] Hi, it's the carpenter. I wanted to tell you the door is ready. Oh, amazing. Well, maybe you can bring it to me tomorrow. [man] No, sorry, that won't work. - Fine, two days from now. - [man] We can't deliver until April. Now? If we waited for him to come, we would've stayed with the hanging sheet for the next six months. I'll be there in 30 minutes. - [Alice] He'll be here in half an hour. - [cork pops] Come on. Don't worry. This one will be empty in ten minutes. One more round! [siren blares] [horns honking] No, no, no, no. There's no problem. No... I'm here. He's bottled up in traffic. [cork pops] I may be wrong, but you said bottle... I said bottled up. Didn't you hear? Yes, sweetie, but the root of the word is the same, you know? Phonetically speaking. Did I mention I'm a professor of Latin and Greek? [calm music plays] Hey, Alice. I'm... [indistinct chatter] - [man] There he is! - [guests] Surprise! [laughing] [man] Hey! Happy birthday, my love. - Thank you. - [chuckles] - Nice. What's that? Your new keychain? - Huh? Because keys go there. It's a joke. - [Dante] You're drunk? - Yeah. - [horn blows] - [chuckles] [grunts] Look, I know you're in the middle of something, but do you have to do this right now? What if any of our guests needs the bathroom? - Here. - What? - Listen. - What the... - [man] I brought you a rum from Barbados. - [sighs] - [urinating] - [man] Extra maturation. Remarkable product. And besides, I can tell you that with a certain degree of knowledge, because I drank half a bottle. - You didn't wash your hands. - Happy birthday. But the real gift is this one. Ta-da. Congrats. [Dante chuckles] What is it? A ticket for the roller coaster. Remember when we were kids, we were always under the roller coaster and never had the courage to ride it? I thought my little friend is now 40 years old. He's a man. It's time he does some crazy shit. We'll do it together. Saturday's the best day. No, I'm busy on Saturday. I got a million things to do, man. - Then when? - Look, I don't know. Days are passing by and I... I don't understand. I don't even notice. Hmm. What are we gonna do? Permanent position. - I've been telling you this my whole life. - [chuckles] You work half the time, you have a lot more time on your hands, you know? If I work a little more, when I'll be around 50, I'll be able to buy more time, you know? Oh, brother, you're so naive. - Happy birthday. - Thanks, my friends. - We know how much you like plants. - Yeah. I love it. It's beautiful. What about that book you told me about? I have to turn in the final illustrations this week. That's great. I'm so excited for you. This is your present. My gift? Mmm. You can tell me if you don't like it, okay? Yeah, of course. Ooh, it's beautiful. [chuckles] [Alice] That's you right there. And this is you. It's the same dress, right? [man] One more round, guys. Come on. Ready? - [Dante] Thanks, I love it. - [man 2] What's this stamp? My dad used that. He always let me play with it when he took me to his office. And she's been signing her drawings with it since she was a baby girl. You really like it? Mmm... It's beautiful. Naughty boy. Yeah, weirdo. Thank you.

Okay, it'll go there. [Alice] Anyway, there's another surprise. What surpr... If you're not too tired... And who is this woman? Arwen, from The Lord of the Rings. [Dante] Mmm. What is it? A role-playing game? I'm a half-elf now. This is more than role-playing. I was torn between Arwen of Rivendell and Frodo of the Shire. [Dante] Hmm. [Alice] But then I thought I didn't want to put all those hairs on my feet. Mmm. And what's more exciting than a nice hairy halfling foot, hmm? [both chuckling] Well, with all due respect, has anyone told you that you're a really nice piece of half-elf? Hey, show some respect. I'm still a lady of a certain age. Really? Almost 2,700 years. Imagine. You look so amazing. [ticking slows down] [ticking speeds up] [alarm rings] [grunts] [Alice groaning] Alice? [Alice] Yes, I'm in here. What happened? I'm just a little bit nauseous. - Oh. - [Alice groans] Well, I didn't know you drank that much last night. [Alice sighs] It's not funny. [Alice gagging] [mysterious music plays] What the... Alice, what time did you get up to clean everything up? [Alice] Huh? [mysterious music continues] When did they bring this in, last night? [Alice] What, Dante? What do you mean what? Um, the table. What table? What table? This... Hey. [Alice] I don't know if I feel like coming tonight. Why? What's tonight? Didn't you say you wanted to go out to dinner for your birthday? Happy birthday, my love. For my birthday? But how many celebrations are we... [chuckles] All right, then, fine. Now who are you dressed as? What are you talking about? [laughs] Come on. Alice, I'm telling you. You're getting a little carried away with this disguise stuff, huh? [chuckles] How silly. What? Did you put a pillow under here? [gasps] Uh... - [Alice] What is it? Are you all right? - Yeah. No... Well, you're... You are... How do you feel? Fine, sweetie. Now that I have puked my guts out, I'm so much better, you know? It's just that you... You're bloated. I've never seen you like that. I'm a whale, all right? Say no more. Maybe something isn't sitting well? Huh? You said you threw up. Maybe it's an allergic reaction. You know, I read it somewhere. Now I don't remember where. But I read that this swollen belly is the allergic reaction when you're carrying a child. Wait, what? Oh, you can feel it. - [Dante] What is it? What are you? - Here, here. It moved. Ah! It's weird, but it's beautiful. By the way, today we enter the 21st week. What... What does the 21st week mean? Yeah, I know. It's not very clear, because they say, "The 21st week." But why do they complicate things, right? Just say, "Five months." Easy, five months. - But 21 weeks? Hmm. It's weird, right? - Wait a minute, please. This doesn't make any sense. Last night, we celebrated my birthday in the backyard. There... There were a lot of people outside with party horns... ♪ Happy birth... ♪ And you gave me my gift. It was a nice gift. It was drawing you made. That was last year. What do you mean, last year? Are you serious now or are you kidding? OCTOBER 2011 Why does it say 2011? [mysterious music continues] I think it's a panic attack. I need to sit down a bit. [Alice] No, now you're giving me a panic attack. [Dante] No, no, no, no, no. Just... Just calm down, okay? Now I'm sitting down and calming down. [both exhaling] Okay. Okay. - Now you go and get some rest. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to rest a bit. - Just take a bath and relax. - Yeah, yeah, a bath and relax. - Meanwhile, I'll make pancakes. - Okay, yeah. - Today you should stay home. - Yeah, yeah. Call your boss. Tell him you're not going. Yeah, yeah. No. No, yeah, well maybe I'll say I'll go after lunch. Yeah. - Okay, fine, go after lunch. - Yeah. I'm gonna take that shower. [dog barking] [mysterious music continues] [ticking] Oh God! - Sorry. Did I hurt your belly? - [Alice] No. No, don't worry. Uh... What is it? [chuckling] [chuckles] I can't believe it. [sighs] I had the craziest dream. About what? I dreamt you were pregnant. [laughing] No way. Imagine that! [laughs] I can't see myself pregnant again. - Too fast for me. - Huh? - What do you mean again? - [baby crying] Uh... [toy clatters] [baby crying] [Alice] Oh, my love, don't cry. Come here, sweetheart. Come wish Daddy a happy birthday. Oh. Happy birthday, Papa. What a beautiful baby boy. Girl, you mean, huh? Baby girl. Yes, of course, b... baby girl. - Well, I mean, she seems like, mmm... - Sweetie. ...if she were real. Oh, yes, she's real. Very real. Help me here. - Here. Hold her for a minute? - No. - I have to go warm the milk. What? - Um... - I didn't wash my hands... - That's how you make antibodies. - Please hold her. - Uh... [Alice] And by the way, I think we should get a dog. I hear it's great for the immune system of the children. [Dante] Oh God. [Alice] And they also help the kids develop the emotional intelligence. I don't quite understand what that means, but... I have a son... - You mean, daughter. - Yeah, a daughter. You're right. - [Alice chuckles] Who would've thought? - I certainly wouldn't. - Who would've thought, huh? - Um... Come with Mama, honey. And what's her... her name? [baby babbles] What do you mean by that? What do we call her? By her name. Oh. Yeah, right. Um... [clears throat] Let's... Let's play a game. Let's count to three and... and mention some names and find out which way she turns. Why is that? Well, just because it sounds like fun. Don't you think? Now... [together] One, two, three! - Galadriel! - What the hell did you say? Don't say bad words. She'll repeat them. - But what kind of name is Galadriel? - [crying] What do you mean what kind of name is it? It's the elf from The Lord of the Rings. Galadriel. Yes, my love. She's the bride of Celeborn. She's the queen of Eregion and Lórien. At school they'll make fun of her. - Again with that? - Yes. You were so convinced, and now you're changing your mind? You said it was a special, beautiful, and international name. - Don't pretend you don't remember now. - Uh... ["Der Hölle Rache" from The Magic Flute by Mozart playing] [door opens] Okay, sir. According to the lab results, uh, everything looks normal. You're healthy as a horse. No, that's impossible. I don't remember anything. I can't recognize my daughter. Okay, listen. My dad had an early onset of Alzheimer's. - Is it possible that there's a connection? - Alzheimer's has no genetic origin. Okay. Have you told your wife about everything that's... No, we're not married yet. - Well, now I'm not sure. - [doctor] Hmm. Ah, here. No. We're not married yet. Anyway, I didn't say anything because the last thing I want is to worry her. As I told you, there's nothing to worry about. How can I not have something to worry about? I just turned 40, okay? Then I went to sleep, and I woke up, and a year had passed, Doc. I went back to sleep, and another year had passed. I went through the same thing, son. After 40, it is what it is. Time goes by, and one doesn't notice. It's physiological. Physiological, Doc? I missed precious years of my life already. - Have you been working too much? - [sighs] - Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. - Then it's just stress. You should slow down. Enjoy your wife, your daughter more. - [operatic music continues] - [baby crying] Dante! [baby crying] - What? - Go to her. Uh, go where? It's not gonna kill you if you take care of your daughter once. Why? Do I never do it? Dante, please. I have a deadline tomorrow. I'm going. Fine, I'll do it. How hard can it be? Uh... [baby continues crying] [sighs] [crying] [orchestral music plays] Whoo! Whoo! Ooh, Galadriel? I mean... Do you want some milk? Do you want some milk? You weigh around, what? Like ten pounds? How long you can keep on crying? [crying] No, no, no, no, no, no. Please, no! If you stop, I swear at 14, I'll buy you a motorcycle. Come on. You need to stop at some point. How about a car? How about a car for babies, huh? Would you like a car? [orchestral music swells] [quiet lullaby plays] No. No. [door closes] Dante, you can't sleep, okay? Dante, you are not... [yawning] ...tired. No. No. Don't sleep, man. Don't sleep, man. Wake, wake, wake. [ticking] What is that? No... Ah! Ah! [suspenseful music plays] What is this? - Do you mean the... - Yeah. I've been telling you for three months. What? OCTOBER 2013 Here. It's ready. Um... happy birthday. Uh, thank you. Yes. It looks... - You have to count to ten. - Yeah. Alice... I think something's wrong with me. Oh, uh... no... Yeah, well, just one... There are a lot of things that are wrong now, but... - Do you wanna talk about them right now? - No, no. - Oh. - Look, I'm sorry. - I have something to... - Are you working today too? Um... Jeez! You said, at least on your birthday, we could try to be together. But I'll be back after lunch. Fine. At least give Galadriel a kiss. Who? - Your daughter. - Uh, my daugh... Sure. Gala... You said it too fast. I didn't... Of course. [sighs] [Dante] Look how much you've grown! - You can walk! - Mama. Mama. - Huh? - Mama. Alice, hey! She's walking! The ba... Uh, the baby is walking! Look at her! Ah! Look! Yeah! She's been walking for three months. - What? For three months? - [Galadriel] Papa. "Papa"! - [chuckles] - Huh? Did you hear? She said, "Papa." Huh? Her first word, she said, "Papa." No, don't even try. Her first word is "mommy." I even sent you a video. - Why a video? Where was I at that time? - [Galadriel laughs] Anyway, we can say it's her second word, huh? "Papa." - The eighth word. - What do you mean? I'm not even in the top five? Mommy, potty, yes, no, woof, Nana, ball, papa. "Potty" was right before "papa"? Well, she certainly sees the potty more than she sees you. Sorry, but since when do I smoke? Don't know. Look, thanks for coming today. - It's okay. The school is busy. - Hmm? My students are sort of dumb, but sometimes they do something right. Here. Thank you. What's this for? Oh, well, it's 10:30, but I thought that... Really? - Oh well, just leave it there. - Yeah, I'll leave it there. It's something. Oh well, thanks. Look, Valerio, I don't know how to tell you this. It's alcohol-free. - What? - It's alcohol-free? No, no! No! No, no. - Uh, just drink it, please. - Oh... Listen. I think that I have traveled through time. Huh. Which age did you end up in? This one. Yeah. Here, right now. So you traveled through time and ended up here in the present? Yes. Well, it's obvious to me that you have no idea how time travel is supposed to work. [Dante] I mean, I... I come from the past, okay? For me, it's as if the last three years just... went by. You know? I'm not saying it as, uh, figurative speech. I mean went by within a day. - Did you see a doctor? - Yeah, I did, actually. - Really? - Last year. - Come again? - I mean, yesterday. Ah, fine. What did he say? He said that I'm just stressed, that I have to slow down. The other day, I saw a documentary of a bunch of American experiments. - You know I love documentaries. - [Dante] Mmm. They took two very accurate clocks, man, and synchronized them on the same time. They left one in Washington, and they put one on a plane that flew around the globe. So what? Interestingly enough, when the plane came back, they compared them. And they realized that the one that was left on the ground, which was... Huh? - Which was... - Oh, in Washington. Yeah. ...was ahead of the one that had traveled. What does that mean? The clock showed that the same amount of time on the plane passed faster. The faster you move through space, the faster you're going to move through time, I think. - I don't know. I was wasted. - What does... [Valerio] Anyway, that was not the point. The feeling you have of time flying by is because you never stop. You never take a day off. You're always in a hurry. - Even what's going on with Alice... - Wait, what? What's going on with Alice? Hmm? What's going on with Alice? I asked you. What's going on? You told me that things weren't going well. You wanted to get counseling. Get... Get counseling from who? Mmm. I don't know. A professional, I guess. Dante, you complain so much about your father, I don't think you wanna be like him. And that job, please quit. Right now. Stop saying you'll do it... in a month, a year. Today. Now. Come on. Take it. - I don't smoke. - Then don't smoke. The problem is not what I do today. The problem is what I do the other 364 days of the year. Right. What do you mean? [sighs] But... if I quit my job today... Mm-hmm. - Mmm! No! No, no, no, no. - Today. - Yes. Thank you. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's the classic mistake. - I love you, but don't do it! - Thanks. [Valerio] You're welcome. Whatever. Bye. [ticking] [mysterious music plays] FILIPPO PINTUCCI DIRECTOR Dante, what are you wearing? Come in. [ticking] [Dante] Excuse me. What... What happened to the director? [laughing] DANTE AGNOSIO DIRECTOR [Dante] Excuse me, Francesca. Can you come for a minute? I want to talk to you. - Sure. - [Dante] Thank you. [clears throat] So I ended up getting the title of director. - Yeah, right. - Oh. Um... Since when? Yeah, you know, like... Eight months. - Eight months? - Yes. - Are you okay? - Huh? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Francesca, listen. Since you know me pretty well... You do know me pretty well? Mm-hmm. Yeah, you might say that. Uh... uh... Tell me, how did I become the director? [chuckles] Well, we all knew when Pintucci retired, you seemed like the obvious choice. You always worked hard for this company. But I was about to quit my job. Listen, last year I was thinking of quitting. But why? Because I wanted to change everything. Life, the pace, everything. And you would've been a fool. The director's salary is... I'd say interesting. Not to mention the benefits. - [Dante] The benefits? - Of course. Free insurance policy, life insurance with survival benefits, death benefits, health insurance for the family. Of course. For the whole family. I'm sure that's why I did it, clearly. Hmm. Happy birthday. - Oh, thank you. - Hmm. Gaetano chose it. It's from him too. Gaetano. Of course. Of course. Gaetano. Thank you. You... You shouldn't have, anyway. Don't mention it. You did so much for me. You gave me plenty of time off to go and enjoy my honeymoon. Oh, you got married? Oh, congratulations! To who? - To Gaetano. - To Gaetano. Of course. Uh... How great. Gaetano. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Uh... I'll open it later. Thank you, Francesca. You can go. Okay. Oh, uh, we all got you a cake. I'm telling you because you don't like surprises, and... Just pretend not to know about it, okay? Okay.

Can you send me the address again? For the GPS. Alice, are you being serious? What are we doing in couples therapy? We've discussed this, Dante. We need counseling. Or we could flush it down the toilet. What? No! You're right. Of course not. [man] All right. Let's take it from our last session. We were talking about the communication block you're experiencing and the attempt you now are making in order to try a new way to dramatize the emotions you're feeling. [Dante] Well said. Today, we will use a technique known as "Couple Sculpture." That's beautiful. I love it. [chuckles] - [man] Dante. - Huh? At this moment, you're gonna need to try to represent what you are experiencing in your relationship with Alice. You can ask her to move in the couple zone where you see her and then represent, in this space here, all your personal boundaries. You mean like some sort of game? Yeah, some sort of game? [Dante] I don't think there are any problems. Our relationship is amazing, so I don't know. - Do I play with the ugly doll or... - That's your daughter. Oh, our pretty... That's a cute doll. Oh, we'll play the game. Uh... [sighs] That's easy. [clears throat] Can you... Right. Uh... There you go. - The baby. - Oh, the... Yes, I did... The baby stands between us. Like this. Yeah, that... She fell, but, uh, it wasn't on purpose. I'm so sorry. Go on, Alice. [Dante] Oh. - Um... - Thank you. Take a step back. Huh? [Alice] Move. Another one. More. - There's a desk. - Get under it. [Dante] Huh? Under? You mean... [grunts] Um, it's... it's low. I don't fit. It's not like... Okay, but there's a limit, you know? Sorry. It really seems to me it's an exaggeration, obviously. Dante, just tell us, what did you mean with your spatial representation? What did I mean? Uh... I don't see the problem because I love my family. What family, when you're never with Galadriel? Who? - Galadriel, our daughter. - Oh, our daughter. Of course. I know. - [man] Look, a few sessions ago... - [Dante] Yeah. ...I recorded you say, "Sometimes I don't come home because I need to spend some time alone." - Alone? - [man] Yes. I actually said that? Yeah, he'd rather go to work than stay home. He's bored at our house. That's not true. I've always said I've never been bored with you, since day one. No, that's not true. That's not true. You said I'm bipolar, which is a weird way of telling someone she's not boring. When did I ever say... I even offer to do things together, you know, like, yoga. - Yoga? - [Alice sighs] Yoga is amazing. Well, now yoga maybe isn't, um... He's always complaining about the child's management. - No, I'm not... - Saying I'm still acting like I'm 15. - Did I say that? When did I say that? - You don't even like my drawings now. No, that can't be true! That's just not... - You used to be proud of me. - But I still am. - [Alice] You cared. - Listen, Alice. Don't... Now you don't ask me anything. We don't talk about anything anymore. It'd be weird if we could actually talk. You're never there. - But why? - You're always at work! If I work my ass off in the office, it's so you can do your cute sketches. [somber music plays] [man] That's enough for today. I'll see you both next week. Look, Alice, those things I told you, I don't know where they came from. - I really like your drawings. - No, no, Dante, don't worry. It's okay. We come here to tell each other things we never said. Aren't you coming with me? I'm busy. I'll see you later. [car beeps] [somber music plays] [toy squeaks] [bottle opens] [gulping] [somber music swells] - [Alice] Dante. - Alice, where are you? [Alice] Uh, I'm home. No, you're not in the house. I'm here. You're not. [Alice] The other house. The other hou... What other house? [Dante] Alice, will you come, please? [Alice] We can't take a break to reflect by sleeping in the same bed. You said it yourself. What break to... No, come on. We don't need any break to reflect about us. Fine. Tell me where you are. I wanna see you. [Alice] I have to take Galadriel to dance class. - I'll come by later, okay? - Promise you'll do it! [Alice] Of course. Don't worry. Bye. See you. [phone rings] Yeah? What?

Happy birthday. Oh. Yeah, sorry. I burned it a little. - I'm a mess in the kitchen. - No, don't... You... Um... Mmm. But I know how to make it up to you. Look, I have to... I was thinking about something. - What is it? - [Dante] Uh... Weren't you married to... that guy, uh, Gaetano? Yeah, but I broke up with Gaetano a year ago. - Oh. - [Francesca] Well, time goes by fast. Listen, Francesca. I, um... uh... I have something to tell you. [Francesca] Mm-hmm. And I don't really know how... how to tell it to you. I mean, the reason you're here... You... I don't... don't... don't... don't... No... Uh, no... It's just... No. I mean, it's obvious that... that... But... You know? I... I think it was a moment or... Yeah, I said it. You... You know what they call it, a one-night thing. Dante, we've been hooking up for six months. Six months? - But how... - [doorbell rings] Uh, that must be Alice. So what? Well, I... Francesca, listen, can you come for a second? I... I... I... have to ask you for a favor since I have to talk to Alice about something very important. - So if you could just go to... - Okay. - What? - ...the bathroom. - The bathroom? - Yeah. Uh... So you can take off this bathrobe. - Five minutes. I swear. I swear. - Dante. I'll settle. I swear. It's really important. I'll settle this thing and... If you can just, uh, go there... Don't flush. [door closes] [Alice] Am I intruding? No, no, no way. No, no. Um... Oh! Do you wanna come in? - Yes. Come in. - Yeah. I... - Oh, happy birthday. - Thank you. Um, so, Dante... You said you wanted to talk about something. When you said it, it seemed urgent. No, it's nothing serious. Well, if you wanted talk about... I miss you a lot, Dante. Oh. I know this break is the best choice for both of us, but... It's just something good happened. What? A gallery owner wants to display my stuff. - That's absolutely wonderful. - Yeah. It isn't for sure sure yet, but... I feel so proud. It just didn't seem so great, because I couldn't share it with you. My first instinct would've been to call you, but then I thought it wasn't the right thing to do. But then you called me, and... I love you. I think I love you too. [sentimental music plays] What are those? What? Those. [Dante] Huh? Uh... Well, those, uh, are a gift for you. Without a box? Um, I wasn't sure about the size, so my idea was... To try them on? Dante, is there a slut hidden somewhere in the house? Alice, what are you saying? Isn't there a woman in this house right now? No, there's no woman in the house right... [toilet flushes] - The bathroom is part of the house. - Oh, uh... Look... No, wait a minute. Alice... I'm sorry I called you a slut, okay? - [Francesca] No problem. I get it. - Um... No, no, really, forgive me. [Francesca] Don't worry. It's not your fault. - Listen... - By the way, those shoes are amazing. [Francesca] Thank you! I even got them on sale. Can I say something, please? Alice... Alice, seriously, I... I can explain. Just wait. You don't have to explain anything. Look, obviously, your idea of a break was different from mine. Alice, I want to be with you. How should I tell you? May I tell you one thing? You definitely gained some weight. I've never been treated like this in my life. Look, Francesca, this thing, whatever it is, it can't go on. I'm sorry. This thing, as you call it, it ends here. Don't worry about it. Promise me. I'm begging you. - You're completely nuts, Dante. - No, I'm not. Just listen to me. If I were to call you and ask you to, I don't know, to meet me for something, like a dinner, or even to ask you to stay over, you have to say no, okay? I'll never set foot in this house again.

A year and a half of a relationship with a non-affective schizophrenic like yourself. You've never been my first choice either, you know? - I loved him. - [Dante] Who? - Gaetano!

[Dante] Are you still seeing Alice? Yeah, I run into her sometimes. - She's still the same. - Yeah, I know. I'm the one who became an asshole. Nah, you didn't become an asshole. You just changed, like everyone else. - When did this happen? - It doesn't happen overnight. It happens very slowly so you don't notice. It's called life. Hey. Do you know what my wish was the day I turned 40? Yes. - No. - To have more time. [Valerio] Hmm. And I was so sure I could get it. Instead, it's the only thing I don't have. [Valerio] Hmm. - [liquid pours] - It's sad, isn't it? Yeah, a lot. - You know what's sad sad, but really sad? - What? I'm 45 years old. I can't hold a relationship for more than three months. I don't have kids, I think... I teach class in high school that kids think is pretty pointless, and they're probably right. And this was perfect for me to forget the miserable, failed life I'm living up to now. It gave me the illusion that everything was fine and now it doesn't work anymore. Actually, it gives me gastritis. And my back hurts. Did I tell you that my back hurts? It's been two months. You didn't fail, Valerio. You're just wasted. I hope so. Another round. Anyway, we never used the present I gave you at your 40th. Which one? What do you mean which one? Whoo! - The roller coaster. - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - I know. You're right. Sorry. [Valerio] Mmm. I was very hurt for that. But I forgive you. [Dante] It's empty. [knocking] You cut your hair! When? Three months ago. You're just noticing now? Uh... If you came to see the girl, she's asleep. No, I came 'cause I wanted to talk to you. Oh. Okay. Tell me. - I don't want it to end like this. - No way. I can't believe you. Every birthday, I hear that story. Look, Dante. It's useless to insist. We weren't meant to be together. You were right. Then you moved on. You're with another woman. - It's over with Francesca, I swear. - And I want to move on with my life. Wait, move on? What do you mean by that? Are you seeing someone else? No... I mean, not yet, but I... Uh, I've been looking for someone, you know? Uh, you're looking for... Alice, you can't break up with me. No. Actually, we parted ways a long time ago. What we had was so unique and special. - You and I were one. You can't deny it. - Maybe that was the real problem. For years, I had this feeling that I was nothing without you. That's why I felt so bad when you weren't around. - But now it's all clear to me. - [Dante] What is? That I'm more than enough. Are you actually telling me you no longer need me? I'm telling you that maybe I was wrong to need anyone. Bye, Dante. Happy birthday. Alice! I love you! I... [gasps] "Love" is a bit excessive. - But I like you. Watch out. - [Dante] Ugh. Excuse me. Who are you? Alice! Careful! There's a stranger inside your house. - [Alice] What's happening? - Can you please leave? - Did you get wet? - Sorry. Who is this person, this... this sort of guru? - [chuckles] - You know how Dante is. He likes to joke. [chuckles] When are you gonna get in shape, huh? When will you have a personal trainer again? - Who's that? - Personal trainer who speaks 4 languages. What does that have to do with this? Who doesn't? - You, for example. - Oh, fu... What? Fine, anyway, who cares how many languages he speaks? - Can you please leave? - [chuckles] Galadriel, your funny father has arrived! - Shall I make something to eat? - Thank you. He even cooks. [man] Happy birthday. Alice, does... does this guy live here? Listen, do you mind if you take Filippa with you? Huh? No, I already have my own problems with one little girl, and you add her friend. Come on. - [Alice] Filippa! - Alice, I'm begging you. Wha... Sorry, but in what kind of world is there a dog called Filippa and a girl called Galadriel? [dog whimpers] Is... Hello, Dad. You... But... How much have you grown? I haven't, Dad. I mean, you used to be... like this, and now you're... you're tall. Like, you're basically... Dad, take me to the park. Uh, yeah. Yes, let's go to the park. Do you wanna play here in the castle? Okay. [grunts] How old are you now? - You're five already? - [Galadriel] And how old are you, Dad? Uh... I lost count. Why? Are you an old man? Yes, honey, I'm an old man. [Galadriel] And am I old too? No, honey. Well, I wanna be old like you. What are you saying? Listen, um... - Galadriel. - Galadriel. Yes, I know. Are you... Uh, when did you get Filippa? It's Omar's. Mom said you didn't wanna have dogs. No, it's not that I don't want dogs. It's just that dogs get dirty and... and then destroy the house. I also wanted to talk to you about Omar. Honey, you don't have to give strangers all your trust. You know that? Omar's not a stranger. You know, he's Mom's boyfriend. Uh, yeah, that's the point. I'm supposed to be Mom's boyfriend, not Omar. But you're my dad. Um... Do you think Omar is funny? Yeah, except for when he tries to make me laugh, but he just can't. And am I funny? Yeah, especially when you say mashed potatoes are ghost poop. [chuckles] Do I really say that stuff? It's actually a bit funny. But then you get mad when I don't eat it because it's really gross. And what do you like to eat? - [Galadriel] Ice cream. - Ice cream. Oh. Chocolate or what? No, Dad, I'm allergic to chocolate. Don't you remember? Ye... Yeah, sure. Of course you are. [sighs] Honey, tell me. What is it that I could do better? What can I do to make you happy? More time, please. You would like... to spend more time with me? [Galadriel] No, it's just that when we're together, you're always on the computer, on the phone. I just want to spend some time with you. What would you like to do? Nothing. Be together, you and me. [sighs] - [Galadriel] Daddy? - Hmm? - Can I come down? I need to pee. - Yeah, sure, come on. Let me tell you a secret. I haven't peed in seven years. - That's impossible! - Sh. It is possible. I'm telling you. Seven years. Bye, my love. - Dad's coming back. - When? [sighs] Pretty soon. Hmm? Listen, Dante, I wanted to talk to you about something. [Dante] What is it? Alice and I have been seeing each other for a while. Things are working out, and so we thought we'd move in together. - No. - Are you still joking or... No, I'm not joking. You can't move in together. Ever. Well, I'm not asking your permission. I'm just letting you know. Listen, Omar. She and I have been really happy together. And even though things aren't great right now, everything's gonna be back to normal, got it? You should really come train with me one day. Yeah, well, I don't have time to exercise with you. You have a very limited idea of my work. Balance does not start in the body but in the mind. You don't know how many people come to me, like you, consumed by all your projects, taken by what you have to do tomorrow, in a week, in a month. And in the meantime, life gets out of hand. - And you know what starts next, Dante? - What? Remorse. Do you know the words of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama? What does His Holiness say? [speaking foreign language] [chuckles] - Are you fucking with me? - No. - The fourth language you speak is Chinese? - That's Tibetan. - Whatever. - I learned it through meditation. And what does that proverb mean in English? It's not a proverb. They're the words of the enlightened. He says, "There are two days a year when nothing can be done." "One is named yesterday, and the other is named tomorrow." That's a proverb, by the way. [dog barks] Hey. Hey. [ticking] [barks] [mysterious music plays] [phone rings] - Valerio? - [Valerio] Hey. I'm at the park. I've been waiting for half an hour. Are you coming? - Uh, yeah, sure. - [Valerio] Oh. - I'm coming. - [Valerio] Right. [Valerio] Oh. Ta-da! Happy birthday. Thank you. So Alice has, um, a new partner. No. It's still Omar. [Dante] Oh, you know him? Yeah. I mean, I know him on Instagram. On what? - Instagram. - What is it? - Don't you know what Instagram is? - No. Are you at the park? You take a picture. Instagram. Do you have a kitten? You take a picture. Instagram. You get a bidet. Take a picture. - Instagram. Uh-huh. - [Valerio] Instagram. Exactly. Hmm. - Basically, you're taking pictures? - Yeah. - [Dante] That's it? - Yeah, that's all there is to it. Anyway, he's not the right person for Alice. - [Valerio] Isn't he? - He's not. She needs someone like... [Valerio] Like? Like me. - Like you? - Mm-hmm. What are you saying? Are you crazy? Until the other day, you told me how cool Omar is, how much you like Omar, how glad you are she's with someone like Omar. Are you being serious? [Valerio] Uh, yeah. [Dante] Huh. By the way, she did a really good exhibition. - Omar? The man paints? - No way. Alice. - Alice? - Yeah. She finally did it. Well, then, I wanna go see it. We went to see it, Dante. Did you forget about it? Oh. Huh. [Valerio] Ah. Don't tell me you're already drunk. - You took just a sip. Huh? - No. You, on the other hand, uh, you quit? What? - Drinking. - Ah! Yes. Of course. - Are you all right? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, really? - Mm-hmm. - You lost so much weight. - Mmm. Seventeen pounds. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. My God, how did you do it? Tsh. I got cancer. That's the trick. [chuckling] - You're... You're a real asshole. - [Valerio] What the fuck, Dante? How are you feeling? - Hey, how are you? - How am I? You know how I am. I'm drinking juice. And... I only have five sessions left. Then next week, I'll get a medical check and see how it's going. What do you mean, how it's going? - It's going well, Valerio, right? - Yes, fine. - It's going pretty well? - Yes, it's going well. Yes. Aw. Don't worry. Don't worry. At most... At most, I die. Hmm. Right. [somber music plays] [Dante] Look, do you remember that roller coaster thing? [chuckles] Yeah. We should go. - When? - When? Right now. - This is the moment. - [chuckles] You're crazy. Come on, Valerio. Let's go! What are you saying? I feel like I'm gonna throw up sitting down. Imagine if they put me upside down. Hey, and what... what are you doing now? Let's hang out. No, I'm busy. Sorry. Come on. Just... a little more. I told you I'm busy. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey. - Huh? Promise me. What, Dante? I'll see you tomorrow. Promise me. Sure.

Will you be on time? I'll be on time no matter what. - Good morning, everyone. - [man 1] Dante, what happened? - [man 2] The meeting started an hour ago. - I know. I called you at least ten times. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. I'm really fine. Are you sure? You look a little distraught. Oh, no, that's because I passed out on a roller coaster half an hour ago. - I think that's why. - What do you mean, a roller coaster? Maybe we should postpone the meeting. What do you say? Maybe we can reschedule for tomorrow. - Is that fine? - No. No? What do you mean? It means I have more important things to do tomorrow than coming here. Francesca, how many vacation days do I have? Ninety-six. Why? Ninety-six days. Very well. - I'll take them all. - What do you mean, all? All of them, and I mean right now, obviously. Dante, what are you saying? We have a contract with Sanix next week. We worked on it for two months. Whatever happens next week, man, we'll think about it next week. Actually, you'll think about it, because I'll be on vacation. Oh, Francesca. I have to apologize to you. I'm sorry if I've been a jerk to you, if I caused you any suffering. I must've been an absolute lunatic. I hope one day you can move on and forgive.

[Alice] All right, sweetheart. Good night. See you tomorrow. Bye. Look, if you want to, you can sleep here with Galadriel. Uh, but I'm sure she'll definitely wanna sleep with you. Hmm. Well, there's always the couch. As I recall, you loved sleeping on the couch all the time. You never finished a movie. Remember? Come on. Text Omar. I'm sure he's not jealous of me. Well, he's a bit jealous, yeah. - The guru? - Hmm. - Of me? - Hmm. - [Dante] Did you have fun with Dad today? - [Galadriel] Yes. [Dante] And the puppy is really cute, right? - [Galadriel] Yes. - [Dante] So what do we call it? - [Galadriel] Boh. - [Dante] Boh? I love it. Boh's a nice name for a dog. [Galadriel] Hmm. - [Dante] Ready for a story? - [Galadriel] Yes, it's in my school bag. [Dante] Okay. Um, this one, Mom wrote it? THINGS THAT PASS It's my favorite book, because Mom said she drew it for me when I was just a baby. Oh. [Dante] "In life, there are many things that pass, change... or just leave." "Sleep ends... just like tears dry over time." "The leaves fall... and so do baby teeth." "Everything passes, sooner or later... elapses... or transforms." "There's only one thing that doesn't go away... and will never go away." EVER "Ever." What about you, Papa? You're not leaving, right? I'm never leaving you. [sentimental music plays] [sighs] [Alice] Go on. Mix it while I pour it in. Come on. Mix it, mix it, mix it. Ooh, it's about time! Good morning, sleepyhead. What? Uh, what are you doing here? We tidied everything up, but we wanted to make you pancakes before we left. Well, your birthday was yesterday, but for once, we can bend the rules. Am I right? Dad, yesterday was the coolest day of my whole life. [Alice chuckles] Yes. Now go take off your pajamas, and then we'll leave. But... So today is... is tomorrow. OCTOBER 27, 2019 SATURDAY [Alice] Are you okay? Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine. I'm... I'm really fine. Look, Alice, I... I wanted to tell you... Right now I don't even know how to tell you. I mean... Um... I... These last few years, I don't really know what I've done. You just did what you wanted to do, Dante. That's all. Um... Mmm, let's put it this way. These years that have passed won't come back, and I know it. And there's nothing more to do. But I think I have understood what I want to do from this day on. It's not enough one day a year to prove that you're different. And I mean, different from who? - It's you. It's always been you. - But people can change, am I right? No? You say that today. And tomorrow? Tomorrow I want to be with you. And the day after tomorrow. - Because you took a day off? - No. See? Precisely. I took 96 days off. - Wait, when? - Today... Yesterday. Uh... What is it? Aren't you glad? It's just that... I know you. You'll get bored doing nothing. You'll get a job while you're on vacation from the other job. No, I assure you I won't do that. People never change, Dante. There's still time. It's ready. Ah! No, no, no, no. Wait a sec. You won't enjoy them if you do that. Listen to your papa. He's an expert at this. Dad's right. You have to count to ten, or you'll burn yourself. One. Two. Three. Four. [together] Five. [Galadriel] Six. [together] Seven. [all] Eight. Nine. [Dante and Galadriel] Ten.
