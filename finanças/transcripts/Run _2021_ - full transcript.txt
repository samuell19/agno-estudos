Mommy, can I play a game? Jerome, take your ass outside and play. - Where... - Take your ass outside! Hey, little man. Hey. Your mama home? Yeah. You being a good boy? Yeah. Let me give you something. How about if I give you $5? My mama said don't take money from strangers. Oh, well, your mom told you right. But I am not a stranger, so here you go. Okay? I got on the helicopter. I jumped up because... This is none of your business. Get out. No, I don't need a... Ronald, get out of my house! You don't know what I've been through. I'm tired. Get out! Ronald, get out of my house now! - Give me the gun. - No, get out! - Get out! - Give me the gun! I like your place. Got you a nice bathroom, nice little kitchen, it's cool. Yeah, it's all right. Shootin' shit. You mind getting your ass off my bed though? Thank you, Sky. So... I hear you got a promotion. When was you gonna tell me? I literally just found out today. Hmm. Well, congratulations. Are you gonna take it? I don't know yet. Should I? Well, I can't decide that for you. Only you can. You right. You absolutely right. Let me ask you a question. What's up? Why are you staying in this little apartment when you could be staying in the house your mom left you? You still looking for her killer, aren't you? No, I'm not. I don't know. But when I decide to move into the house, I'll make sure to hit your ass up to actually help me move. No? [ON RADIO] - All right, I'm out of here. Look, did you get everything out of my car? Yeah, got everything. I'mma see you tonight? Donuts on you? - I got it. - All right. I'll walk you to the door. That would be nice. Officer. Officer Sky. Oh, gentleman today. You pissed me off. No, but I don't understand. Why do you just keep showing up over here? You know why. I told you, we are done! So, just... Just move. You all right? Yeah. I'm Jerome. Yeah, I remember you from earlier. I'm Rayven. That was your boyfriend you was in the hallway arguing with? Ex. How long you been living here? Five years. How about you? Not long. Couple of weeks. Two, three. Oh, so you still fresh? Uh, you can say that. You're a cop, I see. Wrong choice of living, don't you think? Nah, I like it. Kind of remind me of New York. Mmm, nah, I wouldn't know. I've never been to New York. Mmm. You gotta... You gotta go one day. Mmm. Maybe. All right, Mr. Officer. - You have a good night. - All right, you too. - Thank you. - All right. Donte, no! No, you ain't going no god damn... You're not going no god damn where! - Where the fuck you was at, huh? - What does it matter to you? I've been calling your god damn phone, that's why it matter. My phone was dead. Look at you, dressed like a goddamn whore! Like a what? - Are you fucking crazy? - What you think, you think I'm playing with you, huh? - Are you crazy? - You think I'm fucking playing? - Are you crazy? - Like a whore. You bring your ass on ahead, come on! Hey, man, back up. You all right? I'm all right. - You sure? - Yes. Yo, why don't you mind your business, yo? So you like putting your hands on a woman, man? Yo, I don't know what you're talking about. You know what I'm talking about? What the fuck you gonna do about it, huh? Think you're a cop, you think I'm scared of you? Huh? Pig! So that's your little box cutter? Yeah, I will cut your throat, boy! Uh-huh. Hmm? Is that really necessary, Officer? Back up. Listen, nigga. Stop fighting women, all right? I told you about this shit last week. I will not see you in this fucking block no more. You hear me? - I said, do you hear me? - I hear you. I hear you, man. - Huh, you sure? - I hear you. You better start learning how to call the cops or you're gonna be the next woman on the news. I don't need your help. You don't need my help? No. Okay. You two have a good night. Have it your way. I am so sorry, baby. I'm sorry. What you out here doing? - Hey. - Sup? Just meditating. It's a form of healing for me. - Healing? - Mmm-hmm. What you healing? Life, you know? The ups, the downs, and the pain. I hear that. Sound like a little poem. Life is poetry. I'll let you get back to your meditation, all right? - All right, see you later. - See you later. Oi, amigo! What you say? Rayven. If you like her, I'll make a deal with you. I'll give her to you. All you gotta do is... just pay me. Pay you? Or... You let me taste your friend. Sky. I'll take real good care of her. What you think, I'm scared of you, son, 'cause you some money-making pimp that like to hit women? Yeah, I know about you, man. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, mother fuck a. I became a cop because of people like you. If you ever, and I mean ever, mention anybody name you may think I know again, I'll put a bullet so far up your fucking mouth, you won't know what hit you. Oh, so that's a threat? No, Mother fuck a. That's a promise. And I mean what I say. I won't think two shits of it. Try me. Try me. Rayven! Open the door. Robert, can you please just leave me alone? We've been done. So you not listening to me? Hey, Jerome. What's up, Rayven? Nothing. I'm all right, I couldn't sleep. You up for a walk? Let me, um, change my clothes, all right? You look nice tonight. You got a little date night or something? You can say that. Oh, wait. So, like, the ex-boo? Somebody I grew up with. What's going on? What's going through your mind? Well... I really shouldn't be telling you this 'cause I don't know you like that, but I don't know. You seem cool. Kinda feel like I can trust you. Trust me? Don't I feel special. You should, because I'm a special girl. Anyway... Jerome, I'm a stripper. Come on, stop playin'. No, I'm serious. - I've been dancing for some years now. - Wanna sit down? I've been dancing for some years now, and I'm trying to get out of it. So what's stopping you? Bills. And sad to say, Robert. Met him when I first started working at the strip club a few years ago. He was a good guy and he helped me out a lot. But then he started changing. I didn't have a place to live and he let me stay with him. But he would literally just take all my money. He just became really abusive and was, like, threatening me all the time. I was dumb and I didn't really wanna believe that that's what he was doing, but he was. I just don't know what to do. So what you want me to do? I don't know, you're a cop, right? Can't you arrest his ass or something? It don't work like that. You say he a powerful guy, right? Plus, I'm just a street cop. Yeah, and? Okay, that means he gotta have somebody on payroll. But I can keep an ear open for you. All right? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Is... dancing all you do? What, you trying to ask me if I'm a ho? I'm not. I have slept with a few guys, here and there, but that's it. If I'm being honest... my mother was a prostitute. And all I know is she died from it. I'm sorry to hear that. Wait. What do you mean, from all you know? I grew up in a foster home. That's why I never really knew what happened to my mother. That's the reason why I became a cop. To protect women of the streets like yourself. But I got you. You gonna be good, all right? Come on, let me treat you to some coffee. Coffee? That's that bougie shit. I'm gonna need a real drink. - What you want, some Henny? - Yeah. - Want some Patron? - For sure. Oh, look who it is. Hey, what's up? - What's going on, Rayven? - You okay? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. - How you feeling? - I feel good. I actually thought about you earlier. - Oh, yeah? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I really wanted to thank you for our long talk last night. - I really, really, really needed that. - Hmm. So much so that... I decided to stop dancing. - Wait, what? - Yeah. I'm gonna enroll myself in school. That's what's up. Where'd that come from? I don't know, I just think it's time for a change. So I called my boss and I was like, "Look, I'm done." And, so, tonight is actually my last night dancing. And I was... kind of hoping that you could come. Well, first of all, congratulations. I'm proud of you taking different steps. That's a good thing. Thank you. I mean, I really owe it all to you. Nah, you don't owe me, man. So I'mma see you tonight? Oh, man. I don't wanna make you any promises, but I can see what I can do, all right? All right, I understand. I know you're a busy man. Got a job and all that. But I do hope to see you tonight. - Cool? - Cool. All right, well, I'm gonna hurry up and get out of here 'cause I got a lot of stuff to do. What you got there, little girl? I got stuff to do, it's my last night. - Mmm-hmm. - You gonna miss it. Hopefully not. But you, my friend, are gonna be safe in these streets. - All right, I'll see you later on. - See you later. - Have a good night. - You too. Damn. All right, later. - Hey! - Hey, girl! - Miss This-my-last-night-here. - I know! Mmm-hmm. - I'm gonna miss you all, girl. - Miss you. - I'mma miss you all, too. - We're gonna miss the fuck out of you, girl. - I'm just right down the street, seriously. - All right. - Are we acting all bougie queen? - I won't! - All right, I'mma call you all later. - All right, girl. Hey, yo, Rayven! Oh, girl! - You better go get your money! - No, it is not like that. He is just a friend. Yeah, that's what we all say. - Hey. - What's up? What are you doing here? You know, I'll miss your grand finale. Least I could do was come to give you a ride, right? - Aw, thank you. - How was your night? It was good. It was really good. Okay. Got a lot of money? Money in the bag. - I got you something. - Really? - Yeah, hold on. - Okay. Aw, thank you. So sweet of you. Yeah, I don't know. It's the thought that counts, right? It's a little sign. Thank you. Very sweet. I really appreciate that. No doubt. Shall we? Sure. Wait. - I wanna take you somewhere. - Take me where? It's a surprise. - A surprise? - Mmm-hmm. - Are you down? - I'm down. - All right. - Come one. No, wait, actually, let me drive. You ain't even got no license. I don't need a license. You a cop, remember? - You better not scratch my car, all right? - I got you. You better not, I'm telling you. That bag gonna be mine. You like? It's beautiful. Yeah. I come here whenever I wanna just escape the world. You're really spiritual, huh? Yeah, a little. I get it from my mother. She used to read these spiritual books to me before bed. Taught me so much about the moon. So tell me about this moon. Well... That's a full moon, which represents our inner world. Our hidden emotions. Our desires. Our shadow self. Our fears, our worries, and our dreams. It offers us the ability to escape, and learn from the past, and creatively unlock and express our essence. Wow. I didn't know the moon had so much of a purpose. It gets deeper. I'm glad you're willing to learn it, friend. You mentioned your mother. Where is she? She died when I was six. My aunt raised me. That sounds similar to my story. - What about your father? - Mmm. He's around, you know? I talk to him every now and then whenever he wants to be loving. But... He's not the typical type of father that you like to show off, you know? - Yeah. - But we don't get to pick our parents. Word. Why do you say that? Just the stuff he doing. I don't agree with it. That's probably why I'm fucked up now and have daddy issues. Your hands are so filthy. You should take better care of them. I'll try. You ready to go? I'm getting a little chilly. Not yet. I'm kind of enjoying the moment. Get up. Thank you. What? Nothing. Tonight definitely turned out perfect. Yes, I do agree. Oh, and here's your jacket back. Thank you. Thank you for being a gentleman. What? What's wrong? - Nothing. - What, you got a girl or something? No, it's not that. It's just, I don't wanna move too fast. I got a habit of messing things up. Well, look, things can only be messed up if the feelings aren't mutual. Don't over think it. See you tomorrow, okay? - Well, good night. - Good night, Jerome. Did you have a good night? What are you doing in here? I can't see my lady? I'm not your lady. Who said you're not? Can you just leave, please? Oh, I'll leave... after you give me the money you owe me. What money? My fucking money, bitch! I don't owe you any money. You think you don't owe me? You think you can just quit whenever you want? I built you, your life, your career. Everything about you... I built. I built my own damn life. And I don't owe you. And I'm not afraid of you either. So if you wanna beat my ass, so be it. But I will no longer run from you. Fine. Have it your way. But I'll be back. And I want my money, Rayven. I want my fucking money! Lonely night? Look, man. I don't know who you think you are... I'm gonna tell you one time and one time only, stay away from Rayven. Stay away from Rayven, man. I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're making a big mistake. No. Don't bring your ass back over here again, man. It's my last time telling you. Or you're gonna have a bigger problem to handle. Hey, get off of me! Get off of me! Who is it? Who is it? Jerome! You gotta help me. All right, what's up? You all right? They're trying to kill me. Who is trying to kill you? Two guys. They just tried to put me in a car. You all right? You all right? Can you help me, please? What are you talking about? I got you. Where they at? They're in the front, I left them. I locked them out, but I don't... All right. Just relax, all right? I got you. I'll be right back. Just lock the door, okay? - Lock the door. - Okay. Rayven, open the door, it's me. Rayven. Come on, we gotta get outta here. Where are we going? Away. Away where? Look, you said you want to be safe, right? I do. But I'd still like to know where we're going. Look. You asked for my help, so I'm helping you. Let's go upstairs and get your stuff and get away for a couple of days. Is that cool? - Yeah. - All right. You ever shot a gun before? I've been to the gun range when I was younger, but that's it. Good. You're gonna need all the experience. Let's go. Let's get outta here. Thank you. Whose house is this? It's mine. Yours? Yes, it's mine. My mother left it to me. Can you put your bags down and don't touch nothing? You don't have to be so nasty about it. Please. Is that better? Look, if you're gonna be an ass about it, I can just leave. Because I'm really not feeling your attitude. I'm sorry, all right? Just tired and... I just wanna lay down. So can you please have a seat? I'm gonna go put my stuff down, all right? Is this your mother? Yes, this is my mother. And I thought I asked you not to touch nothing. I actually took that picture. That was my first baseball game. My mom was crazy. She used to be the only black person in the stand screaming my name. "Go, Jerome! Go, Jerome!" It's crazy, man. You all right? Yeah. My family actually doesn't live too far from here. So I was kind of hoping that maybe we could stop by, if you don't mind. Yeah, let's do that. Wanna get something to eat first? - Mmm-hmm. - All right. - Um, where's your restroom? - Right there. All right. - Hey, aunty! - Hey, Rayven. What you doing here? Oh... We were just in the area. - Okay. - Come to just stop by. This is my friend, Jerome. - Hi, Jerome. - How you doing? Come on in. Y'all come on in. So are you guys hungry? I just cooked. No, we just ate. Thank you. So what brought you by? Well, we were just in the area, and I wanted to see my favorite aunty. Aw, that's so sweet. I'm glad you did. Where are you from, Jerome? I'm from the area. I haven't been around in a while. I was in a foster home when I was younger. Okay. Well, welcome home. You're welcome to come by here any time you want. I appreciate it. - Okay? - Thank you. Now you know your daddy's in town, right? Mmm-mmm. I had no clue. I haven't talked to him. Well, maybe it's just your luck. - Ronald. - What? Come on in here. There's someone that wants to say hi to you. Oh, man. - Hey, Daddy. - Baby. Mmm! Look at you. Wow. - And who may this might be? - This her friend Jerome. - Jerome. How are doing, Jerome? - Fine, thanks. Jerome here is from the South Side, too. What part of the South Side? The 70s. The 70s? Well, it's nice meeting you. Well, you know what's funny, is that Ronald used to be in the 70s, too. Maybe he knew your mama. Oh, girl. You think I know everybody. That's it. You do. But I'll let you catch up with your aunty. Where are you going? I got some running around to do before I get out of town tomorrow. Back out of town? But you just got here. Yeah, I know. But I promise, I'll make sure I get around to see you tomorrow, and we can catch up. You guys staying on the 70s, right? Yeah. 1152. 1152. Okay, I'll be around there tomorrow. Girl, you're looking good. You're looking just like your mama. Damn! I love you. I love you, baby. I love you too, Daddy. - Okay. - All right, see you tomorrow. All right. Where's he's going? I have no idea. He's been running around since he got here. All over the place. Mmm. You got it smelling good in here. What you cooking? A little something something. You hungry? Yes. Thank you. You all right? You seem a little off since yesterday. I'm fine. Your energy is down. What is this, your little spiritual shit? What's that mean? - Nothing. - No, say what's on your mind. Stop running from everything. - What are you talking about? I ain't running from nothing. - You are! Every time I try to talk to you, it's like you close off. What do you want me to say? - The truth. - The truth about what? - What's bothering you? - Nothing is bothering me. Can I have a moment to myself without you trying to get in my head with this spiritual bullshit? Get in your head? Spiritual bullshit? Every time I try to talk to you, it's like you... zone out. Please. It's like you're purposely trying not to open up to me. Look. You've gotta learn to face whatever it is you're dealing with. Look at me. It's okay. You need love around you. You're right. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Expecting somebody? It's my dad. Oh, shit. How do I look? Like you just getting out of a fight. - All right, I'm just gonna... All good? It's good? - Yeah. Coming! All right. - Hey, Daddy. - Hey, baby girl. How are you doing? - Good, how are you? - I'm good, I'm good. So you can go ahead and have a seat. I gotta go do something real quick. I'm gonna get Jerome. Oh, okay. Jerome, my daddy's here. How you doing, Jerome? I'm all right, man. Well, how did you and my daughter meet? We bumped into each other downtown. Do you like her? We're just friends, man. And what kind of work you do? I'm a cop. You like being a cop? When I first started, man, let me tell you, when I started being a cop, I was searching for something. That's always the case when you... when you're searching for something. Well, tell my baby girl I love her. I'm gonna hit the road. - Sit down now. - Excuse me. I said sit your ass down. You think I don't know who you are? You're the man who killed my mother, man. And you got the nerve to walk up in my house like you don't know what you did. I don't know what you're talking about. Man, you know exactly what I'm talking about! I remember you. Your face, your voice, them hands. I think you got it all wrong. - Your mother wasn't... - My mother wasn't what? A prostitute? Tell me something I don't know. Like, why shouldn't I take your life, man? Your mother was my best friend. I did not kill your mother. She was suffering. Suffering from what? Depression. Drugs. She called me and asked me to come over to help her 'cause she was ready to kill herself. I loved your mother. I would do anything for your mother. Jerome. - I just wanted to save your mother. - Bullshit. - Jerome. - Bullshit! - Your mother is... - I think you need to leave my house. - Jerome. - I think you need to leave my house! Where you going? I'mma step out for a little bit. Okay. I just wanna thank you for being the most amazing person I have ever met. I owe you. Nah, you good. You don't owe me nothing. Hey, do you have an extra set of keys? I'mma go by my place to pick up some more things. Uh-uh. What? You having second thoughts? Nah. Keys is in the drawer by the refrigerator. Okay. Jerome, you good? I'm all right. All right. Can I get a kiss or something? I want some more. - I'll see you later, all right? - All right. Be safe. That's number five! Yeah! - Right there. - That's what I'm talking about, thank you. - Yolanda, I'm so hungry. - Me, too. What is that, chicken taco? No, got that a sad a. What? - A sad a... - With the cheese? - No. I don't eat cheese. - Me neither. - How are you feeling now? - Good. - I'm really having a good time tonight. - Are you? - Yeah. - Well, that's the plan. - This was the best date you've ever took me on. - Yeah? Yeah. Hmm. Ah, man. This is my boss hitting me up now. What does he want? Don't even matter. It's about you. So what made you wanna watch that gruelly-ass movie? I mean, the previews looked good. I don't remember you being into that type of stuff before. Mmm, I had to find myself. - You know? - Yeah. Stop for a little change. You came a long way. I'm proud of you. We both did. I'm proud of you, too. Your mother would have been proud of you, you know that? - Yeah, she would have. - Yeah. - I appreciate you. - I appreciate you, too. You know what? When we was younger, you used to always get me to try to hop on that damn train. - Yeah. - I ain't scared no more. Let's do it. - We're going on the train? - We're going on the train. Right now. - Right now? - Right now! - Right now! - Okay, let's go. So you couldn't be a man and tell me yourself? Tell you what, Rayven? You know what I'm talking about. That you're back with your ex. Look, I'm not back with her. So what is it, then? - It's nothing. - Why would you play with my heart and my feelings after everything that I told you I've been through? Look, I'm not playing with your feelings, and I'm damn sure not playing with your heart. I just seen the girl to tell her - I don't wanna see her no more. - Shut up! - You're lying. - I'm not lying. You are a fucking liar, Jerome. I can't believe I thought about fucking with your weak ass. I hate you. Rayven, don't say that. Look... I know you mad and all, but... Don't put your fucking hands on me, all right? Or what? Hmm? You gonna hit me? No. I Think it's best that you leave. - Yolanda, wake up. - Mmm. What's wrong? You remember when we was young... you used to ask me why I never called you pretty? I always thought you was the most beautiful woman I ever knew. I was just fighting with my own insecurities. My mother used to be the only one who really complimented me. You've always been there for me. And I appreciate you. A lot. Look, I think we need to just move forward. And you find somebody else who deserves you. I love you so much, I swear. You don't love me. You call me over here at 3:00 in the morning... to have sex with me. You don't want me. You never wanted me... I should... No, I called you over here to talk. You wanted to have sex. Jerome. That shit could have waited. But you know what? You're right. I do deserve better. Thanks. You'll never be hearing from me again. Robert, please move. What did I say to you? Now I've been real nice. And I let you have a little fun. But playtime is over. So pack your shit and we're getting the fuck outta here. Too late, amigo. That's your little friend. I need something warm. And then she would've been like... Fucking trunk rattlers. Got a little babysitting action. Hey, Roberto! - The fuck? - That's what you wanted? Oh, you son of a bitch! Where she at, man? I ain't telling you shit, puerco! I'mma ask you again, where she at? - You know, you got a lot of fucking... - Hey, don't you... Get your fucking hands off me, homie! You've got a lot of fucking balls coming down here. You know where the fuck you're at? I ain't worried about that. Where she at, man? I ain't telling you shit! Fucking puerco. You got a hour to bring her to me. Or your ass is mine, man. Oh, fucking scary. - One hour. - Fuck you! That's what your mama said. Fuck you too! Bunch of bacon wraps. Fuck all you motherfuckers. I think that's the house right there. That's his car. Look. You got 15 minutes or I'm coming in. Look, I'm good, all right? You've helped me enough. I don't need your help, all right? You crazy if you think I'm leaving you. I already got you into this. But I'm not trying to get you involved into this shit, man. I'm already involved. You have 15 minutes. I got this, all right? Go home. Papi. I know... I know I haven't always been there for you. But I promise... I promise you, I'm gonna make everything different. You're gonna go to a good... You're gonna go to a good school. Mmm. I don't want you to have to end up like your daddy. Love you. What took you so long? This bitch has been screaming all day. I want her out of my house, Roberto. Mira, calm ate. Okay? Don't tell me to calm down. What did I say? Drop the gun. Oh, my God. What the hell? Fuck! Fuck you doing in my house? Drop the gun, man. - Fuck you! - Where's she at? I'm about to leave her in a body bag and put it right in front of your door real soon. I'm gonna give you to the count of three. One... Two... Three, motherfucker. You fucked up, homes. Shouldn't came up in my house like this. It's okay, mijo. It's okay, papi. Don't worry. It's okay. It's Jerome, huh? Oh, I've got something for your ass. Come out and play. Come out and play a little, hmm? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna bury both of you motherfuckers together. That way you can have your little fairytale. "And lived happily ever after." Uh... I see you. Oh, fuck! You're all right over there? Fuck you! You hurt? Huh? Fuck you! Fuck me. Stupid ass. I'll piss on your fucking grave. Is this how you want your son to grow up, Robert? So that's what you want to do? You want to go after my family? - Nah. - Fucking coward. I don't wanna go after your family. I wanna go after you. I'd say where she was at if I were you. Where is she? She's in hell. Go ahead! Do it! So do something good for your life. Fuck you! Fuck you. Jerome! Don't shoot. Roberto! Roberto! Oh, my God. Baby, baby, baby. What did he do to you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! You fucking murderer! Let's get out of here. Yeah. No, it's all good. It really is. No. Uh... They're glad to see that. Yes. Yeah. Oh. My daughter is coming. Okay, I'll talk to you later. All right. - Hey. - Hey. How you doing? I'm glad you were able to make it. - Hot chocolate. - Thank you. - You remember? - Daddy always remember. What? One thing I can say for sure. You are my daughter. Is that your way of telling me you had doubts before? No. It's my way of saying I'm sorry. All these years I've been taking you for granted. Putting my responsibilities up on someone else. For that... I'm sorry. Why though? Why would you just leave me as if you didn't care, knowing that I had nobody to run to after mom died? I don't have all the answers, but what I can say is, I was running too. Trying to figure out who I am, where I want to be at. Sometimes as a parent, you don't make all the right decisions. That's just an excuse, Daddy. Well, that's my truth. Well, it's not good enough. Daddy, do you know... what I had to do for money? I had to dance and sleep with men... thinking that they would give me the kind of love that I should have gotten from you. Well, you did what you had to do, right? What? What kind of father says that to their daughter? The kind of father that is still healing, Rayven. I'm not perfect. I've done some messed-up things in my life. But I didn't sit around and pout about it. One thing about being a man, a man can never stop being a man, and I'm man enough to step up and say, I'm sorry. I admit my wrong. Life is not gonna always be easy, Rayven. We have to put forth better effort to be a better person and good results will show from that. This is me asking you for your forgiveness and to help me become a better father for you. Did you kill her? Your mother? No. No. Jerome's mom. Rayven, I have never killed another soul. Jerome's mother was my close friend... and still is. What do you mean and she still is? She's not dead. What's up? I just want to thank you for not giving up on me. Thank you. You taught me a lot, to be honest. Not to be afraid, to embrace it. Why don't we get away? You know, like, maybe go to New York since I've never been. You're really stuck on this New York shit. I am. Let's go. - I'm down for it. - Okay. Cool. - You wanna leave tomorrow? - All right. Baby, I've been texting my dad. We talk. Mainly because I needed closure for myself. That's good. I asked him to meet me here. Baby, I think you two should talk. - Talk about what, baby? - Your mom. Baby, to heal, you have to be able to face those who scarred you. And even though he scarred me, he has some unknown answers that he could probably help you with. That man can't help me with shit. Baby, I forgave him. Can you just try it for me? Please? Please. Hey, Daddy. I'm gonna let you two talk, okay? Baby, I'll be in the car. I'm sorry, Jerome. Us parents don't always get it right. Some do. Some don't. Shit. If I'm going to be honest, it has taken me some 30 years and I'm still learning how to be a father. But one thing I do know about your mother, she is a fighter. Come on, man. Stop talking about my mother, man. A fighter just like you. I'm working on having a better relationship with Rayven and hope that includes you too. My baby girl, she loves you. And love is hard to come by. Take it from me. What's this, man? It's the address where your mother is. Come on, man, you come over here to talk about my mother, yo? My mother's dead. All right? Your mother's not dead. Go see her. You got everything? Yeah. What the hell you got in these bags? We're going to New York, right? Remind me to change my shoes - before I get out the car. - All right. Jerome, I love you. Girl, get in the car. - Jerome, I love you. - I love you, too. Which house is it? It's this one right here. You sure you don't want me to go in with you? I'm sure. Okay. I'll be right here when you get back. All right. Who at my door? Oh, my God. - Jerome, hey, baby. - Don't touch me! Well, you wanna come in? No, I don't wanna come inside. Now, Jerome, you listen here. You need to lower your voice. No, you listen to me. How could you just leave me like that? All these years I'm out here searching for somebody who killed you, and you're alive. Did you even think about searching for me? I'm sorry. I wasn't there. But I thought of you, though. You... You thought of me? Why? Can you answer that? Why? I wasn't well, Jerome. I couldn't take care of you. I couldn't take care of myself. I wasn't good for myself, for you, and nobody else. You gotta understand. I couldn't do it. You don't know what I've been going through. You don't know how I feel. That is not a good enough answer for me. Thank you, though. - Thank you for nothing. - Jerome... Jerome, now you get back here right now. I said get back here, Jerome! Jerome!
