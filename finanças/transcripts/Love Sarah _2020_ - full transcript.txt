Hi, this is Sarah. Sorry, I can't take your call right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hello, Sarah, it's Isabella calling. Yeah, I'm outside our bakery, waiting for you. So hurry up and get here, okay, 'cause I'm freezing my bloody arse off. OK, everyone. Positions, please! Hi, this is Sarah. Sarah, congratulations. Today's the day, right? Uh, you got the keys? It's gonna be the best bakery ever. "My dearest Sarah, I'm sorry we haven't spoken for so long. I've been dreadfully stubborn and for that I'm not proud." 1, 2, down, nice. Hip up, shoulder bump. Down, 1, 2. Down, lift, up, and right, left, right, up, and cut, and step strong. Mimi Curachi? Yes. There's nothing I can do. But one of us is dead. But it's a joint lease, you know that. You both signed the contract. But she was the chef. I'm not a chef. I mean, it's kind of like opening up a zoo and saying, "Come on in, but guess what, there's no animals." Well, can't you find a new one? Uh, someone as good as Sarah. Oh, she was famous. She trained with Ottolenghi! I don't know how it works. Huh! I'll tell you how it works. You sit there all cheerily, smiling, "Look how big my balls are," and then my best friend is killed. My investors pull out, because their star chef is dead, I'm losing all my savings while the place sits empty, and now... now that it's all gone tits up, you're sitting there and you're telling me, "There's nothing I can do." Look, really, genuinely, I am sorry for your loss. You signed the agreement together and I will do my best... my absolute best to try and re-let the place, but you know yourself it... it was empty for a long time and uh... I wish there was something more I could say. Okay, everyone, positions please. Nice and calm. Breathing on 5, 6, go 7. And you just say 1 and 2. Down 3. Open back full, nice. 5 and 6. Round. Clarissa? And 1, 2, and 3. 4. And 3, and 4. Clarissa? I'm sorry. - Hey, what's... - I'm sorry. What's going on? Hey. Playing first message left today at 4:16 p.m. Mimi? Hi, it's Olga here. Um, I hope you're okay. I... I just wondered if maybe you fancied poker on Tuesday. Y... we... we'd all love to see you. Um, anyway, let me know. Take care, bye. Didn't hear from you all day. I was worried about you. Clarissa, are you gonna talk to me at some point? Sometimes I wonder whether I'm a boyfriend or a bedroom. I know you're havin' a hard time. This isn't just about you, it's about us. We're not happy anymore. Are you breakin' up with me? Oh my God, you are breaking up with me. I'm sorry. I have nowhere to go. Hi, Clarie. Just checking in. Yeah, I just... I wanted to let you know I've finally have some interest in the bakery. Nothing is confirmed yet, but there is this guy who wants to... Huh, open up a pop-up wine bar. Oh God, I know this is not what Sarah would have wanted. I mean it's not what I want either. Supposed to be a bakery, our bakery. Sarah hated wine. She drank beer, anyway. But, I don't know I... I probably should agree to it. Everything's fine. It doesn't look fine to me. Honestly, I promise. You know this girl? Yeah. Yeah, she's my... she's my niece. You don't know if she's your niece. Well, she's my best friend's daughter. And where's your friend? She died. Thank you. Get up, Larie. Come on. Hi, can I help you, madam? Uh, no, it's fine. - Mimi! - Olga, hi. How are you, stranger? Well, you know, same old, you know. Listen, uh, it's yoga at 4:00. Do you fancy it? It'd be great to see you. Well, no, I... I don't think so. It's been so long and I'm completely out of shape. Rubbish, look at you. 4:00, okay? And then we'll go for coffee after, like old times. I'll see you at 4:00. Okay. So you wanna tell me what's going on? Has something happened with Alex? I thought you guys were living together. It wasn't workin' out. I suppose you could stay at mine. There's no space. There's a sofa. I mean, I know it's not ideal. Honestly, it is totally fine. Well, it's obviously not, is it? What the hell are you gonna do? There is somebody I could still try. There she is again. Magical Mimi Curachi. Celebrating 12 years on the trapeze today. With this surprise show, she is proving to her fans once again... What an incomparable star she is. Sure you're gonna be okay? Mmhmm. - Will you come in? - No. I haven't seen Mimi in a long time. Milk? Do you have any soy milk? That's fine. I'm sorry, I haven't visited. I did intend to, but, um... ...I just think living in London, time goes by and the things that you meant to do like the coffees, and the visits, and everything, you just... you look at your diary and suddenly it's October and... Yeah. Are you going to tell me the reason for this visit, Clarissa or are we going to have to battle our way through this small talk? Can't um, a granddaughter visit a grandma? Yes, a granddaughter can. Pity she hasn't. Oh God, that is very hot. How much do you want? What? How much? Do you really think this is about money? Look, I haven't seen you for God knows how long. You come in here unannounced. Of course it's about money. I need a place to stay. Oh well, that's different. So heavy. - Thank you. - Cheers. Thanks for your help. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. Ow! - Careful, that... - Oh, sorry. Ow, Jesus! Why is that right in the doorway? I wasn't expecting you to have... Really quite cramped around here. Yes, I didn't expect you to have quite so... So much. Okay, this is it. Uh... It's fine. Okay. - Careful. - Oh, sorry! Ow, Jes... Oh, for heaven... Turn down that fuckin' music! Did you sleep well? Yeah, thanks. Um, I'm going for a run. There's a key on the side. - Sorry. - It's alright. I'm outside our bakery, waiting for you. There's nothing I can do. It's not what Sarah wanted. But one of us is dead. ...these stock auctions, the quarter 4, 2018, there is a clear parallel in the figures from quarter 1 to quarter f... 4 of 2018. And what we need to do is capitalize on that growth and... Hello, I'm so sorry. Isabella, could I just talk to you for a minute? I'm really sorry, I won't take her from the meeting for very long on this... on this one. Excuse me, sorry. Excuse me. Thanks. Do you know how hard it was to get this job back? Yes, I know, but... I had to beg. I'm 39 years old. Do you know how that feels? - Don't do it. - What? The wine bar. Let's open the bakery. What are you talking about? You and me, think about it. Yeah, 'cause it's that simple. But yeah, of course, it is. Okay, so... ...this is where we're at financially. - Is that pounds? - Yeah, but that's nothing. I mean, there's costs, set up, insurance, materials. The only way of making any money on this place is by actually selling food. Without a baker... Somebody as good as Sarah, we're nowhere. - Larie. - Yes. - You getting this? - Um, yeah, uh, sort of. I need to know that you understand the full scale of the thing, you know? Mmhmm. Oh my God, this isn't gonna work. This is not gonna work. I can get the money. Please just tell me where we're going. You're gonna find out soon and trust me. - You're going to enjoy it. - I won't. - Oh my God. - I won't. Okay. I didn't want to come out anyway. Should we leave it? Hello, everybody, welcome to Flying Fantastic. My name is Jen, I'll be your instructor today. For those of you I haven't met uh, this is an intermediate-level class, so I'm assuming you all have a little bit of prior know-how. Yes. Great, let's get started. This is ridiculous. This was your life. A long time ago. - I'm past it. - Sshh! Rubbish, you're in the prime of your life. Hardly. So long as you've got your incontinence pads on. Very strong. That's... that's really nice. Okay, so bring the hand... Yes, I know what I'm doing, actually. Thank you. Yeah, that's it. So if you just sit to the side and this will... lay back. - That's it. - No! - Good, so... - No! - Re... - She's got the wrong arm up! - And her bum's sticking out. - Okay, just reach... - Wait. - Excuse me, sorry... Yes, but... look, tuck your bum in, change arms. There. You see? Like that. Just like that. I can't believe you, Mimi. Hmm, what? The look on their faces. Oh dear, I hope I wasn't too rude. Yeah, you definitely were. Oh, my thighs. I'm not gonna be able to walk for a week! Well, you look like you haven't forgotten a thing. Maybe you should look at getting back into it. Thank you. Maybe I will. When I looked across at you, you are going back to your company, aren't you? We're gonna open the bakery, me and Isabella. We need some financial help. Yes, I wondered. - What? - What a shame. I thought you and I had some... Ugh! Take her to a trapeze class, butter her up, - I'm not stupid, Clarissa. - What? Mum's gone now and the... oh, there were just so many wasted years between you two. And the least you could do is come and have a look. - Uh. - Good morning. Hey. Mimi. Isabella. You look well. This? You want money for this? Okay, so it does look a bit rough at the moment, but you can definitely see its potential. What? As a crack den? Okay, ladies, picture this, right? A big table, and a bar, and then big industrial coffee machine, and "Oh, what's that smell?" Cat's piss. No, it's not cat's piss. Croissants, fresh from the oven. Yes, but what do you two girls really know about opening a bakery? I'm sorry, did you just call us "girls"? This is what she does. It's what she always does. What about your circus, okay? You started that from scratch. If anyone knows how to steer a ship, it's you. I'm not falling for that. Look, are you in or out? Okay, ladies, if we are going to do this, we are going to have to get along, okay? Mum would have wanted us to open this bakery, so that is what we're going to do. Together. Hello. Isabella? Mimi. Well, you're gonna let me in or what? Oh. I should have called. It... it's just that I was... I was so nearby, I thought... You know... Clarissa is just like her mother. And Sarah was just like hers. What? You mean stubborn? I know I let you and Sarah down before. But she wouldn't have wanted this, would she? Me? That's all she ever wanted. I'm gonna clear this, because uh, I just want to have the floor here. You can put that in the back... - Everything... yeah... - Yeah. Let the dog see the rabbit as they say. - Yeah, exactly. - I'm good. - To the back. More of a mess. - I know. I want to get the floor clear. No, it does need paint. - Can we just clear this? - Yes. - Right out of the way. - To the back. You're... So I was the head chef over at St. Mary's School for Girls. You know, nothing fancy. Jam roly-polys, that sort of thing. Not that the girls really cared much. They just vommed it all up in the toilets. Yeah. Just put it up in position, 'cause I can't tell. So long as I'm home by 6:00. I cannot break my curfew. My starting salary is 45,000 with 35 days' leave. Obviously, not including public holidays. And I don't work nights or weekends. I'm here about the baking job. - Is it still available? - Get out, Matthew. Warm welcome. The position's been filled. Really? You sure? Thank you. Leave the way you came. Look. I'm serious. Is someone going to explain? You must be Clarissa. Hi. This is Matthew Gregory. We trained together. I was a friend of your mum's. Oh, uh, you're a chef. I am, Michelin-starred. You're not Michelin-starred, your restaurant is, and you weren't her friend, just a pretentious womanizer. Well, I'm not one to boast, it's actually two-Michelin starred. - Aren't you at Trois Amis? - Yeah. Why would you wanna leave? Well, you know, I fancy a challenge. Then climb Kilimanjaro maybe, I don't know, take up crochet. Alright, look, I'm after... A bit more creative control. Alright, so you wanna come here, why? The stuff that you make, it's not really in our range. I can make anything! Listen, he and Sarah had proper history. I really don't think this is a good idea. Oh, don't be daft. You can't turn down a chef with a Michelin star. Two Michelin stars. We want this to be a success, don't we? Let's go for the best. Presenting Ispahan. Bless you. It's a rose macaron filled with rose petal and lychee crémière and fresh raspberries. Hmm. I wanna try it. The batter's undermixed. Sorry? Not by much, but it could do with a few more folds. Okay, yeah, do you... do you need me to be here for that? Somebody will be here. Okay. Orange wellhorn, a chocolate mousse sitting on a crunchy chocolate samblé, finished with a mirrored chocolate glaze and crunchy chocolate pearls. Is there a simpler way of saying that? Mousse on a biscuit. Mousse on a biscuit. Mmm. Hmm. Tastes really good. When can you start? Excuse me, can you just pull over here? Hey. What are you up to? I think we need a drink, don't you? Thank you. Thank you. - I don't do shots anymore. - Neither do I. Come on. Let's celebrate like the old days. 3, 2, 1. Mmm. Clarissa? Do you want some supper? I'm all good. Bake with me. You're right, I'm not Sarah. Your passion for this project, that's what we need. Put that in the kitchen. - Except I'm not a baker. - Yes, you are. - We trained together. - Yeah, years ago. - So? - So... I'm not as good as her, alright? - I never was. - Rubbish. You were her best friend. You were practically sisters. If anyone can put her spirit into this, it's you. Ugh. Sarah was special, okay? She... she was talented, she was the baker, I just run things. I... You can do it. I need to pee. So that's the light bulb. Mmhmm, thank you. Black coffee still? - Of course. - Okay. Thank you. There was a time in about 1985 and I'd just come back from Peru, and you and Sarah are desperate to try the coffee I brought back. And you didn't sleep for two days. Do you remember? Yeah, I do you remember that. You always wished you were sisters, didn't you? Mmhmm. Absolutely inseparable. I was very proud of you. Both of you. Mimi. I've really missed you. What do you think? Mimi? Hmm. Sarah. Love Sarah. Make way! Golden coffee bean eclairs. Not bad, bakery boy. Thank you. Um, excuse me. - Who's left this here? - Not me. Matthew, please don't leave it... - Mimi. - In the window. - It wasn't me. - It looks awful. - I just wanted... - Somebody did. - Put that in the kitchen. - I'm not doing it. So the contactless, you just can't use that. When they're using cash... I know, but I don't understand how the machine works. - You just need to... - Just write it all down. - Write it all down. - Write it all down. Oh. - Whoa! - Sorry, Matthew! - Oh my God. - Oh my God. Uh, do we need these? Probably. You see this goes there. Oh, I like them actually. So I'm having these. Here we go. Wow, crowds! They'll come. They'll come. Oh dear. Hi, welcome to Love Sarah's. Hi! - Have you just opened? - Mmhmm. Yeah, it's our first day. 50% off of everything. - Hello. - Nice! What would you like now? Pastéis de nata. What's he saying? Oh, he's just wants a cake that we have back home. - Where is it? - Lisbon. Hmm, I'll tell you what. Hmm, would you have one of these maybe? Purple? Yeah, perfect. Would you like a coffee? Oh yes, please, a latté. I'll get you a plate. Two people and it's lunchtime. Relax, it's our first day. No one knows about us yet. Exactly. Oh, hello, yes. I was wondering if I could speak to your food editor, please? Hi, could I speak to a... uh, Naomi Parker, please? Yes, it's Isabella. I'm calling from Love Sarah. Oh, she's left, okay. We're a new bakery, Golborne Road. Do you know where she's gone? Hello? Hello? Again. No, I'll just write it down. - Oh! - Good morning. It's our friendly neighbourhood watch. I see you spying. Here. It's our soft opening. On the house. There are four other bakers within five minutes' walk. What makes you so special? Why don't you try one and tell me? I'm Mimi, by the way. Felix Rosenbaum. You the proprietor? - We all are. - Mmhmm. Well, you wanna be careful around here. You know, intruders, burglars. As fate would have it, I've just finalized my latest invention, the most advanced infrared security system of the 21st century. How fascinating. So good luck. Thanks for dropping by. Simon. To what do I owe this pleasure? I'm just popping out. Hey, we're still open. We're dead anyway. Give him a break. Yeah, Isabella, give me a break. Can you, um... Thanks. He's only messing. - Yeah, right. - Come on. It's fine, he's hilarious. Jesus. - What, are you jealous? - Oh, please. Alright, well, you don't need to be. You know, 'cause it's not like I'm gonna sleep with my dad anyway. What? Matthew is not your father, okay? He's not. Okay, well, then who else would it be? That I can't tell you. Why? Because she always said she never knew his name. Oh, come on, that's bullshit. Clarissa, he's not, okay? He can't be. I'm sorry, were you there at the conception? Sarah never lied, did she? To anybody. Certainly not to me! I mean, if... ugh, if he was then... then I would know. Well, then why is he here? I don't know. I am flattered. I am, honestly. Okay. Y... look, I can't. Not yet. I'm... just... Give me a couple more weeks. Alright, thanks. Yeah, bye. Morning. You're late. Relax, it's the weekend. We've got work to do. Have you got me a bonnet as well? You're hilarious. Where's Clarissa? Why? No reason, I'm just wondering where Clarissa is. This one is you. - Thank you, cheers. - It's okay. - Hello. - Hey, Matthew! Mmm. Do you remember the first time you met mum? Of course, I do. It was our first lesson in Paris. What was she like back then? - Scary. - Hmm. Intimidating. Beautiful. So what actually happened with you guys? I messed up. I was, you know, young, irresponsible. Did you love her? Oh, pomegranates. Did you? Everyone loves everyone when they're 19. Yeah. Oh, raspberries. So why did you come to our bakery? It's a difficult question. I don't know, I suppose unfinished business. Mmhmm. When I heard about what happened to your mum. I felt terrible, like I should have... I should have got in touch. Made amends. Hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Ow! What was that? Sor... it's nothing, you had a... You just... you had a thing on you. - A thing. - Ow. That was weird. What? Okay. So £83, 55p. Which makes... £658. Oh Lord, is that it? It was only our first week. But it doesn't even pay our rent! It takes time, Mimi, doesn't it? Oh, we should be jammed in our first week. People are always excited about a new place opening, but we're empty. It was just our first week, everything's fine. Everything is not fine, Clarissa. Mimi Curachi? Yes, that's me. Enjoy. Hmm. Thank you. Who's buying you flowers? Mind your own business. Hello. I brought you a little something. We had rather too many leftovers and it seems a shame to waste them. - So... - Well, alright. - Would you like? - Lovely, yes. Yes, well, please, come in. Come in. Yeah. Uh, oh. - Um, where would you like them? - Oh yes. Um, right. Uh, right, yeah. That's... that's... yeah. Here, g... give me your coat. Oh, thank you. Thank you. What a nice apartment! - No, it's a flat. - Oh. Not Americans. - It's a flat. - Hmm. - Within a house. - Oh. Of course, it uh, used to be a whole house once upon a time, but that's what we do these days. We chop, chop, chop, chop. We'll be living in a cupboard in 30 years. We won't be around in 30 years. Lucky us. Hmm. Thank you very much for the flowers, by the way. Oh, uh, thank you for the uh... - Eclairs. - Confectionery. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. So you really are an inventor. Well, I keep trying. - Voilà! - Oh! Yeah, when you're inventing, you're looking for something that people don't know that they want. Oh my goodness! This was Sarah's favourite book. I used to read it to her when we were on tour. - Phileas Fogg. - Hmm. Yes. Inveterate rival of mine, yes. Great inventor, intrepid traveller. Mind you, these days we don't need to travel to discover the world. The world has come to us. Oh, sorry. - Sorry. - Sorry. Hello, I have a delivery here for Mimi. Thank you. Can you sign here, please? Thank you. Uh, ooh, actually um, why don't you try a slice of this? W... what... what is it? This is a strawberry fraisier. Frais-fraisier? Yeah, it's like this creamy strawberry... Jelly mix. Yeah, sort of thing, if you're into that. Oh, okay. Can't have this. Th... thank... thank you. Yeah. Um. Um, hello, excuse me. Just a second. Um, take that out for a minute. Where are you from? Express Bikes, why? No, no, don't tell the... What country? Oh, Latvia. - Latvia? - Hmm. And what do you have at home for a treat? I... I... I do not understand. If you went to a bakery, what would you buy? - All sorts. - No, that's what I mean. What exactly would you buy? Don't yell at me, lady. No, I'm just asking you what was your favourite. I don't know, I suppose kringle. What's that? It's... it's like this sweet bread thing. Oh, it's so good. And can you get them in London? I don't know, I... I don't think so. But would you if you could? Of course. Good. Okay, you can go now. - Where's Matthew? - He's in the kitchen. Matthew! Look, let's look around us. London is the most multicultural city on Earth. - Isn't it? - Yeah. It's like a sort of cosmopolitan collective, but nobody's actually from here, are they? I mean, if I think about it, uh, Boris, my butcher is Hungarian, my yoga teacher is Russian, and Nicoletta, who runs the flower shop, she's from Italy. What do you think these people would really like? Something to remind them of home. Right. Like that young boy who came in minute ago. He doesn't know strawberry frasier or... - Fraisier. - Fraisier, whatever it is. He doesn't know that. He only knows a kringle. And if he wants a kringle, then let's make him one. I mean, he can't be the only Latvian in London. This city is home to so many people from all over the place. If the government stops tryin' to kick 'em out. So what are you saying? We make our bakery a home away from home. I mean, Sarah loved to travel, didn't she? Discovering new food, when she was studying abroad. So why didn't we bake foods that no one else bakes? Something for our customers to remind them of home. What do you think? It'll be fine. I just... we just need to research it, I think. Okay. - Okay. - Oh, look. Oh, it looks great. - Isabella. - Yeah. In the kitchen. - What? - Now. What was that? So you're gonna join me or what? And then sukker, kanel, smør, like dash, dash, dash. Thick. You fold it over into thin stripe and then we twin the... Thin stripe? Like um, twist, you know? Twisty. This is the roll, right? Use both hands and just like that. Harder. Okay, we use... just a good hand, right? And then hand around, twice. Then you pop it through. - Kanelsnegl. - Great. Yeah, it's so easy. How many do you want? Um, 30. - That'd be good? - Perfect. Wondering if I would... Ow! Oh God. Oh yeah. It's his new invention. Yeah. Oh, Felix. Hmm. - Uh... - Oh, sorry. I beg your pardon. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. I'm not sure that needs too much icing. Mmm. - What do you think? - No. - What's that called? - Panforte. - Panfortes. - Mmm. - Panforte. - Panforte. - Oh, it's so good. - Can I try this one? Yeah, that's Australian, it's a lamington. Loads of Aussies here. Hmm. I think we need a proper taste test with some locals. Yeah, but who? Actually, I know who. Mimi. Hello, Olga. You got room for one more? So this one is... Tanzanian. - Tanzanian? - Yeah. Mmm, delicious. Are there many Tanzanians in London? - 17,000. - Hmm. 4,000 Venezuelans, 16,000 Russians, 5,000 Norwegians. And a partridge in a pear tree. And Hondurans? Oh, Louisa, I'll have to check. But I will, though. Mimi. Mimi, I love it! Mimi, what are you doing? I thought this was a good idea for our Instagram account. No, no, no, no, Instagram is for me. I was settin' that. Look, black forest gateau. Delicious. - That's actually very good. - Do you like? Hmm. Mmm! Can I help you? Mmm. Yes, um, can I have a large cappuccino and um, pain au chocolat to go, please. Of course. £4.75 please. Where are you from? - Tokyo. - Ah! Um, matcha mille crepe cake. Yes! How do you know? - Do you make them? - We can. Well, if you make it I'll buy it. Deal. Can you do me one by tomorrow morning? Why not? The Japanese clearly have too much time on their hands. What should we do? I don't know. Start again. I guess. I've got a better idea. And it's not... you were just confident. You both were. You were made for each other. It's not about confidence, it's about balls. You got to grow a pair of balls. - Sarah had balls? - Yeah, massive balls! - Huge! - You kidding? That's what you got to do in life. - Pretend you've got big balls. - Right. I mean, people like me, we're just pretending. And then we busk through life, performing, when really underneath it all, we're just... We're just like everybody else you know, frightened, scared, insecure. Only we walk the walk. That's what you've got to do. Just walk? Swagger. Better than everybody else. Well, that's easier said than done. Oh, you're a good Baker, Isabella. You're talented, you're creative, you just... You got to get out of those sensible shoes. Thanks. Get 'em off. What? Show me your Louboutins. - I don't have Louboutins. - Yeah, you do. Come on, get up. - What are you doing? - Oh. Repeat after me. I'm the best goddamn baker in the whole world. - No! - Better than... - My God. - Everybody else. - Stop, Matthew. - Come on, say it! Okay, fine. - I'm a good baker, okay? - A good baker? Well, you're wearing brogues right now, like flip-flops! I asked for Louboutins. I'm the best baker in the world. Louder! I'm the best goddamn baker in the whole fucking world! Are you happy? Second best. You know... You're probably never gonna believe me. And it... It makes... makes me sound like a bit of an arse, but when we were uh... When we were in school, in Paris... And I got together with Sarah. Mmhmm. That night I came over... It wasn't her that I was looking for. You're right, you're an arse. We have to work in the morning. At 4:00 a.m. Japanese bloody matcha cake. Do you want this? Oh, thank you. You shouldn't really be smoking. Oh yeah? Why is that? Because you're a dancer. Not really anymore. When are you gonna go back to class? Um. I don't know, I wasn't planning on it. Don't leave it too late. Mmhmm. Don't waste your talent, Clarissa. - Yeah. - Hmm? Well, it's just hard right now, isn't it? - Why? - 'Cause we've got the bakery. The bakery? But it's all set up now. You did that for your mum and it's great. I just really miss her. I know. So do I. I wish you would tell me what happened with you guys. Alright. Your mum came to me to ask me to give her some money to set up the bakery with Isabella and I turned her down. And she accused me of never being there for her. Actually, she was right. - Hmm. - I wasn't. We'd stopped talking to each other. That was the saddest thing. Don't let us ever be like that. - Yeah, no... - Promise? Yeah, promise. You still hate me? Yes, I do. Oh shit. We should get up. Yeah. We should. Isabella! Isabella! The key's in that... What's going on? Let me in. I'm so sorry. I... aren't you supposed to be at Gastrell's? Look, I can explain. I can't hear you. Come on, open up. Oh, bake with me, Isabella! Be our passion. Why? So you can just go off somewhere better? - No, it's not like that. - Isn't it? No, I wanted you to bake with me, because you're a good baker. Right, well, this good baker's got work to do, okay? - Isabella. - Just... Fuck off! Is that... look, we got sesame. Yes, it does. Oh. Oh! Matcha mille crepe cake. Well done! - That is perfect. - Thank you. Can we talk? They sent me the contract to try and entice me. So you have thought about it? Briefly. - Do you want to go? - No. I thought you were looking for a challenge. - I am! - Bollocks! Matthew, you're here because you think Clarissa's your daughter. - No. - Oh, come on! Alright, I mean, maybe in the beginning... For a bit, but... Things have changed. You know what? Just... just go, alright? And don't come back. Is this because we slept together? Because Sarah wouldn't have liked... No. N... No, it's because from the minute you got here, I said... I said you were bad news and look how it's turned out. You need me here. You said it yourself... I can bake all by myself. Is everythin' okay? I'll see you around. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh, my knees. Aha. Eureka. Thank you. Can you please stop being so stubborn? Just let Matthew come back, he's part of our team. If you've got nothing useful to say, then get out of my kitchen. Mimi, she's distracting me! Well, I agree with Clarissa. Anyway, 35 top-thin knödel. - Good luck. - Oh. I was speaking with Matthew last night... And he misses us. Honestly, he just... he misses you. Yeah, I'm not interested. Really? No. CLARISSA Okay, then. - Come with me! - What? - Here we go, this way. - Wait, this... This way. Excuse me. Hi, I'm so sorry to disturb you. - Hi. - Uh, are you single? - Larie. - Uh, yeah. Great. No, he was checking you out earlier. Do you wanna go on a date with her tonight? She baked you that croissant that you're eating. So imagine her baking that for you every morning with bacon, and eggs, and sex. - Uh, if she wants to uh... - She does. You should come pick her up tonight at 7:15. - Uh, sure, yeah. - Okay, great. - I got to talk to you. - No, you don't. Clarissa, I've got... Sorry, she has a funny way of doing things. - Hi. - It's nice to meet you, - I'm Isabella. - I'm Pascal. - Oh, Pascal. - Nice to meet you. - You're French. - Yes, yes. I have to get back. You liked the croissant? Yeah, it's amazing croissant. That's good. Um. So do you often get set up like this? Never. Really? That girl should set up a dating agency. - She'd make a fortune. - Oh yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Hmm. What? S... somewhere to be? No, sorry... well... Yes. Actually, I'm sorry, it's just we had this really big tricky order come in for tomorrow and now all I can think about is whipping, and creaming, and tossing, and... oh God! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it like that. It's alright, we can do this another time... - Mm-mm. - If you want. No, no, this is good for me. I... I need to relax. It's gonna be fine, right? Well, work is work, you know? - Just... - Right. Well, isn't this cozy? Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I'm Pascal, by the way. Pascal? Hmm. He's very French, isn't he? You tense? See the way she's sitting? She does that when she's tense. You're not making her tense, are you, Pascal? - I just... - Matthew, come on. A date shouldn't be tense. A date should be exciting. Although, it has to be said she's a very tense person. Matthew, come on. But she completely gets away with it, because she's... She's great and... ...you'd be lucky to have her, Pascal, tense or untense. Alright, look, I've made mistakes. Okay, fine. I'm a... I'm a terrible person and if Clarissa is my daughter, then it'll be really difficult. But I... I just want you to know that I'm... I'm in this for the long haul, I'm not going anywhere. Whether you like it or not, alright? Enjoy your date. I like mille-feuille the best. Would you make a mille-feuille? I was gonna send it off. Yeah. Find out, but um... Well, once I got to know you... It just didn't seem right. So what do you wanna do? Do you wanna find out? Yeah. I think so. Um, yeah, I've only done 5p so far, so... - You've done what? - 5p so... Come in. Oh, hello again. Hi. Um, I know this is huge, but you could maybe do me two of those matcha cake by tomorrow 9:00 a.m. Two? Oh, we have these big Tuesday meetings and it's my turn to cater, and I was telling all my colleagues how good you are. Consider it done. You're my lifesaver. Oh, you can't just spring that on me. You made one last time. Yeah, one. But now, this is two. On top of everything else. Well, you're just gonna have to call Matthew. No. Well, one thing is for sure, you better make them good. Time Out. - Mmhmm. - Mmhmm. Oh! Oh! Ooh! Sorry. Thank you very much. Hello. Um, I'm here to drop these off for Yuuna Tanaka. I'll tell her they're here. Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I can take them up myself. They'll be okay here. Okay, sure. Um, please don't... These you go. Careful with them. Thank you. I don't know I can't see them. Why not? I don't know which office they're in, Mimi. Oh. Oh, hang on. But what can you actually see, Clarissa? Hold on. What's happening? Well, I can see people chatting, but no cakes. Oh. Excuse me. Can I help you? Hello. Is this man with you? Shh! No, I have no idea. So, um... ...you gonna see that guy again? I'm gonna keep my options open. Matthew. Well... This is me. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for walking me home. Well, it's good for the legs. It stops them from seizing up. Good night, Felix. Good night, Mimi. Actually, would you like to come in for a coffee? So long as it's decaf. Otherwise, I might be up all night. Lucky me. Did you ever watch Jeremy Kyle? No. They did these live DNA tests. Can you imagine? Must be fun for them, I suppose. I don't think it's fun for anyone. More fun than STDs. That must be the worst, right? Weeping vag... Oh my God. Sorry. I'm a bit nervous. Listen. If I'm not your father... - Whoa. - No, no. - If I'm not... - No, Matthew, please. I can still be there for you. You really don't have to say that. I want to. Um, be there. I'm scared of the dark, I'm terrible with money, and I smoke far too much weed. Why would you want me? Matthew, Clarissa, so sorry to have kept you waiting. I'm afraid the results aren't quite what I think you might be hoping for. The test results are negative. We do have a counsellor available if that might be of help. Do people get excited when you tell them it's a "yes"? Hello, Mimi Curachi speaking. Hi, Mrs. Curachi. Um... What? This is, uh, Yuuna Tanaka's assistant here. Do you have a moment to speak? I don't know what you're talking about. Tuff Turf, Robert Downey, Jr. - Oh my God. - They're gonna run a feature! - Who? - Time Out! - What? - They're gonna run a feature - on us! - Oh my God! Oh my God, that's amazing. Matthew, have you got any brandy? - Yes. - Quick. Oh my God. - After all this! - Adored them! - Well, that's all... - Well done, you. That's amazing. Whoa. So you're happy with that? Why don't you put yours the other side. And um... - Actually, um... - Yes. Clarissa, can we... Okay, how we looking? You're gonna sit. Here, there, now sit here. - Okay, get them together. - Are you ready? Okay, come on. - Okay, final checks. - Yeah. Good. You've gotta be in the front row. - Sorry. - Come on together, please. Yeah, that's good. - Okay. - Ready. - Smile. - Okay. - Okay, great. - Here we are. - Front page. - Well done. Well done, we've done it. - Thank you. - Smile. Hmm. One more time. Sarah would love this, wouldn't she? She really would. - She would. - I know she would. - Smiling. - Thank you. Last one. "My dearest Sarah, I'm sorry we haven't spoken for so long. I've been dreadfully stubborn and for that I'm not proud. Of course, I'll support you in whatever you need. Perhaps, we could meet up soon and discuss your brilliant bakery. I'd like that. It's time we spoke again. All my love, Mum." Is anyone else hungry? Starving. - Oh my God! - Mimi. Oh, um. You want them, you want them? Hi... Hi, sorry, two more ticks. Just... sorry, sorry, two more seconds. - Need a hand? - Yes. Um, can I please have... One cappuccino and two flat whites? One cappuccino and two flat whites. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. Yes, madam, what can I get you?
