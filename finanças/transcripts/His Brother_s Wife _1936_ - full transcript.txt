Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Is he asleep or is he dead? Nein, nein, the little pig only makes monkey business. He plays possum. I wish I could find it as funny as you do. Don't forget this. Something like 9.000 of our workmen have died have died in the jungle... ... in the last couple of years from this spotted fever. We can't support a place like this with our mines closed down. Mr. Winters, among those 9.000 was Dr. Heinz, my predecessor. He accomplished nothing. But he did die, didn't he? Do these ticks cause the disease or don't they? When will you know? Mr. Winters, I'm a scientist, I am not a fortune teller. I asked you a practical question. And I'll try to give you a practical answer. Well, Chris, if you look like a scientist, then I'm a goldfish. Hello, Pop. You ought to be home getting your beauty sleep. Hey, Chris, where is your band? Oh, I'm kissing New York goodbye on both cheeks. Who'd make up my Edith's tonic? You know, Pop, it's a funny thing, but right in the midst of gaieties, song, and dance, I happen to remember Edith. - Nobody matters to me but Edith. - That's very good, Chris... - Come on, stick out your tongue, Edith. - Chris, Mr. Winters wants to talk to us. Will you fellows tell me something I can tell to our board of directors? They're frankly reluctant about sending you on this experiment. - Yes, I... - Now, now, now, don't coax them, professor. - Chris! - In plain English... What's the Rockmore Mines going to get for its money? And it costs plenty to send a scientific expedition down there. Did you hear that, Edith? Think of all the money you're costing these nice men. Will somebody keep this drunk quiet! Eh, eh, eh, eh! Pop says everytime you get mad you go back a million years. The glands dry up the spiritual joints, that's what makes evolution so slow. Of course I could develop a thesis if I weren't so thirsty. Just how drunk are you? This is just how drunk I am... ...and it may be my last chance to tell you the truth. But if you ask for it, you're going to get it. - Chris, my boy, what's the use? - The thing that makes me sick is... ...you haven't got a smell of a notion. Why, this fellow here, this great man, ...is heading for a spot so many have never come back from. You think you're hiring him to do it. You think you can pull the gods... ...down from the hills and put a harness on them and say giddyup! - Why you... - Now listen, you listen to me... ...or I'll make you listen. When this world was made, for every pain in the neck that was stirred into it... ...there was a cure somewhere. That's why Dr. Heinz died, you thought you paid him for it. You think you're paying Pop here for it. He's going down to your rotten fungus swamps... ...because he's fool enough to believe that he's got to be a buddy's father's business. And there aren't dollars enough in the world to send him across the street. Okay. I guess I asked for it. - I know I got it. - Now why didn't you stay mad? I had a lot more to say. But if you are going to remain here in charge of this laboratory, don't try it again. He goes too, besides with me. What the devil are you saying? Then the noble words were for yourself. Oh, so you're going to be tough to get along with again, huh? Listen, if he's a sublime a goof as I painted him, he needs somebody to look after him. Well, I've got Edith all fixed, I've got a thirst to fix, I would want to do that too... So, good night, noble experiment. Mr. Winters, we, who are about to die, salute you. Claybourne is in to us for five grand. Nine, and it's red. How do you expect to keep your customers? - Take another shot at him. - He's scared to death. - Here's a hundred. - One? Somebody worked hard for your money. Five hundred, twenty on 8. Hey, you got lots of chips there, I can see them. - Oh. - Eight on black. One seventy-five for Miss Wilson. One pearl-handled pistol and some curtains, please. Either that or kill somebody. - All down, here comes the winner. - Another five on 8. Eight on black. Tough luck, Mr. Claybourne. Now I know why they call you Fish-Eye. You're in five grand. Alright, I'll give you a little check. Number eight repeats. You see, if you hadn't stopped me, I'd be even. - That's all, cash me in. - Two hundred dollars. If you'll come into my office, Miss Wilson, I'll cash them in. Oh, no, I'll take it right here. That is, unless you don't want to be seen crying in public. There's a little matter I'd like to talk to you about. It'll only take a moment. Excuse me, I think he wants to give me half interest in the place. Allow me. - Thank you. - This way, please. - Cute little place you got here. - You like it? Bet this furniture cost a couple of hard bricks. How that must hurt. Thanks, Fish-Eye. - It's a pleasure to see you win. - Sorry I hadn't more chance to please you. Remember there's plenty more where that comes from. Yeah? Well, that goes for back bills and some new rags. Miss Wilson, you come here quite a bit, don't you? What do you do for a living? I'm a fugitive from Major Beaux Howard. No, on the level? - Don't you know? - No. Well, I'm a mannequin. Buyers have to be entertained... ...and it's a swell way to do it if you want to eat regularly. Well, you're entitled to get more out of it than just dinner and a couple of drinks. Now, there are several girls who always make a point... ...of bringing their friends here. - Oh, steering for suckers, huh? - That's the idea. I kick back ten percent for them. I'd be glad to cut you in. So you think I'd bring guys in here to have you fleece them to get a cut. Isn't it bad enough they have to pay through the nose for phony food and liquor? Now wait a minute. Lay off, will you? That's the crummiest proposition I ever heard. Alright, lady. But keep your mouth shut. I'd hate to see anything happen to them pretty teeth of yours. - I got enough left to buy you a drink. - I came over to buy you one. - I'm the winner. - Alright, I'll have a gin ricky. - What'll you have? - Thanks, a large glass of water. Lovely spring weather we're having, isn't it? Hm-hmm. Who are you? Why? Well, as a kid I was always taught to say... thank you, miss so-and-so, or mister so-and-so. Oh, alright. My name's Rita Wilson. - Want to make something out of it? - I certainly do. Oh, Rita. Did you forget that we were supposed to check in at Harry's party? I've been looking all over the place for you. Oh, that's too bad, Bill. But this is a distant relative of mine. Oh, is that so? Well, I didn't notice anything like that at the roulette table. That's just it. We haven't spoken to each other for years. His, er... his branch of the family doesn't approve of me. Sir... we're going to dance while I give her some messages from Duluth - I thought you came from Des Moines. - Oh, I do, I do... But the Claybourne branch of the Wilson family comes from Duluth. You know, your aunt Mary is the mother of twins, and er... one of them looks like you and they're scared to death. Oh, no! I heard them call you Claybourne. Yeah, Fish-Eye's calling me a lot of things right now. Related to Dr. Claybourne? Well, there are two doctor Claybournes, my father and my brother. I'm related to both of them. - Your father has my appendix. - Well, some people have all the luck. Hey, not so tight, not so tight. What about all the neighbors? Neighbors? No, no, no, we're all alone here. There hasn't been anyone but you all evening. If you say everything all at once, what do you do tomorrow and the day after? Who said my luck was bad? Bigger than Duluth, isn't it, cousin? Hm, brighter than Des Moines. Yeah, it's kind of tough to say goodbye to all of this. Oh, you can't. You can't shake off New York. It'll follow you around the world like a dog. Or a woman. - Hmm... burnt child, huh? - Yeah, my fingers are ashes. Now don't tell me I'm getting warm again. Oh, no, no. You're safe with me, Mort. I'm just a neon sign. But you didn't tell me where you were going. Jungle. Got a date with a bug. What's that? With a what? Well, it's like this. Down there, a thousand or a million miles or something, there's a little bug. A killer. Oh, I see, public insect number one. No, on the level. I'm leaving around the first of June. - Scientific expedition. - Oh, forget it, you're not a scientist. They have whiskers down to here. That's why they disguised me as a playboy, full of germs. Oh... Kind of had me fooled too for a minute. Uh... you know you're a very attractive girl, Miss Wilson? Oh, alright, I confess. Somebody would have told you sooner or later anyway. Look, is this party that we're not exactly at awfully important to you? I mean, couldn't we play hooky and sort of... Well, er... Are you going to be risking your life in that jungle? Oh, absolutely! I'll be dying like flies. Then it's my patriotic duty. Let's go. No, no... it won't do. I don't like your profile. Or your full face either. You know, I always get serious about noses like yours. It takes two to get serious, cousin. Well... I wish you had a wooden leg or something. You know, I'd hoped to leave this continent with a clear mind. Oh, I don't go for sentimental hangovers myself, big boy. I've got a career too. Ten or eleven million people stewing at our feet, another hundred in there, and only two of us know it's a big joke. Whoa! Okay? Thanks, there you are. Cover the waterfront. - Are you tired, Rita? - Never better. What do you say if I come in and cook some breakfast? More breakfast? We had it at Giuseppe's, the Dutch Mill, the Kitty Kat and Paulina's. Well, come on, let's sit down and watch the rest of the world go by. You know, Rita, you're a lot of fun. You take a circus, you mix it with Monte Carlo, you sprinkle it with Coney Island... ...and you season it with the moonlight of Venice and it spells R-I-T-A. Months from now when you've forgotten my name... ...I'll write that to you on a postcard. Ten days yet. Ten more days of glorious insomnia. We could collect a lot of hats in ten days. By the way, doesn't that little trick of yours ever land you in the hoosegow? No, I just can't seem to resist collecting hats. That isn't the only thing you collect, is it, Chris? I crown you Queen of the Night. Well, I guess I'd better be going. - What's your hurry? - Work at nine o'clock. What do they do to you if you don't show up? What do you do with a gun? - I scramble eggs like nobody's business. - With a gun? No, with a stove, you idiot. Alright, you go home and practice and phone me tonight at seven Now look, you've got to have lunch somewhere. How about with me? One o'clock at Howard. Of course you know I could sort of sit around on these steps... ...until a quarter to nine and see that you got to the store alright. Good night, you loon. Hey, wait a minute, haven't you forgotten something? - Haven't you forgotten something? - Huh? - Oh, yeah, yeah, I did. - It's much better that way, isn't it? Good night, Chris. Fooling around with an ice cream man, huh? I'll show you! Let me down, my heart's in my mouth! It isn't big enough, your heart, I mean. Ouch! Ouch! What's the matter? Oh, my poor girl. Did no one tell you? May went the way of all flesh two days ago. Just about the end of our sentence, isn't it? - Almost time to... - Yes. We're down to hours now, five, six, seven... Good Lord, my boat leaves in less than twenty-four. Did you ever know ten days to go so quickly? Sure, once when I had the measles. - I'm flattered. Did you have a light case? - Hm-hmm. I have a light case of everything. Low susceptibility and... quick recovery. I see, no bad after effects, huh? In a couple of days I'll be just a memory. What will you remember, Rita? Oh, I'll remember a lovely, crazy interlude, all tied up with bus rides and laughs, lots of fool talk and... ...sometimes no talk at all. I'll remember hitches in milk wagons, throwing stones in the Hudson River, changing hats with the multitude and... You. You will leave me a couple of hats, won't you, for my... ...memory book? I'll remember all that. And a lot more too. A beautiful gay smile and... ...some bright, shiny tears. That's a lie. I forbid you to remember that. Hey, where do you think you're going? Do you know it's five hours since we had dinner? I'm starved. I'm going to clean up a bit. That's what I like about you, so soft, so sentimental. Here it is, my last night and all you can think about is your stomach. Well, it's been pretty nice, hasn't it, kid? What? Oh, yes, lovely, not a bit of rain. Us, I mean, stupid, not the weather. You know, I really think I'm going to miss you. - No. - Yes. Now I know I will. You know, I can't bear to think about tomorrow. No such thing as tomorrow, don't you remember? Oh, yes, yes, no sentimental hangovers. Careers come first. And only... only two people knew it was a joke. What's the matter, darling? I don't know. I... I just can't snap my fingers anymore. Easy, you're not losing your sense of humor, are you? Who me? No, I can hardly wait until tomorrow. A whole new batch of buyers. You don't need to rub it in. Oh, what difference can it make to you fighting your old bugs in the jungle? No difference at all, not the slightest, minutest, most infinitesimal difference. I guess I'll get my hat. Yeah, it's a good idea. Oh, darling. We never expected it ending like this, did we, dear? There won't be any kind of ending now. - I never dreamed... - Neither did I. When did you first... Oh, way back in the milk wagon hitch, I guess. Oh, darling, if we go on laughing, and playing, and kidding... with each other another minute, I... If you'd sail tomorrow, I... If I'd sail tomorrow? - Well, you're not... - How can I possibly give it up? Oh, that's right. I forgot this was all a joke. Come on, let's, uh... pick up those feed bags. - Now, Rita, listen. - Oh, listen to what? You can laugh if you want to afterwards, Chris, but... But just once... just once in a lifetime two people meet... who completely and hopelessly belong to each other... Sometimes they don't admit it until it's too late or they... ...they don't fight hard enough to stay together. Oh... I guess it's pretty funny. Me expecting to be taken seriously by a Claybourne. Delusions of grandeur, old girl. Humph. Why, you couldn't have made tourists third on their old Mayflower. Now look here. In the first place, the Claybournes didn't come over on the Mayflower, they came over two boats earlier. In the second place, if I don't go on that expedition tomorrow, I'm washed up. No career and a yellow label. - And in the second place... - Third! Alright, third, fourth and nineteenth place. Compared to a mere woman, do you know what my career amounts to? Do you? Not that! Oh, darling. You... you mean I... - I've beaten the bugs? - You've wiped them out. Miss Wilson, I love you. Professor Claybourne, I adore you. Come on. - Where are we going? - Home. To break the news. Taxi. Yes, sir. Let me take them, Mike, I've been waiting for them. - Say, what's the... - Orders from the big shot. Here you are, sir. - 85th St. 34 East. - Right. Hey, I don't want to stop here. The boss wants to see you. I haven't got a date with Fish-Eye. Why did you bring me here? Orders, sir. Why, I'm a son of a gun. Now I want to see Fish-Eye. Come on. Howdy, how are you? Do you think I'll stand for being pulled in like this? Hold your horses, kid. Or you'll blow my head off, huh? A couple of weeks ago you said something about a check. - My check for five grand? - That's all I want. You got all the dough I had. It was your idea to keep on extending credit. Well, I'm overboard. It'll take me some time to get it. - You got no kick. - Alright, you'll get it, every nickel. Yeah? You're leaving this neck of the woods for the jungle. Sailing tomorrow afternoon. And no insurance company would bet a nickel you'd ever come back. Something's changed my mind about going. - Oh, quit stalling. - You think I'm lying, huh? Quit it, will you, I got a business to run. Ah, you're a funny kind of rat, Fish-Eye. Now get busy for the jack to make that good. Yeah, sure, when I come back. Mr. Claybourne, gentlemen. I won't bother you with names. What goes on here, Fish-Eye? Well, these gentlemen saw me cash a check for five grand. That's ten years if anything's wrong with it. Ten years, no fooling. Why, you dirty... Boy, I treat my guests right. Takes a pal to cash a check like that. - How long do I get? - The bank closes at 3 p.m. tomorrow. You won't get away with this, Fish-Eye. Three o'clock or ten years. And that's that. And that's that. What's the matter? A check. If I don't dig up five thousand dollars by tomorrow, I spend ten years turning boulders into little pebbles. Come on, let's get out of here. Just don't worry. Tom will help us. Will he? Must be some brother. All wool and a yard wide. Never makes a mistake. You know what kind I mean? - Oh, yes. They scare me to death. - Chris... Chris! - Yeah? - Hold my hand. - What's the matter? - What are you scared about? - I don't know. Well, this is the family stabbing grounds. Gee, it's so quiet you can hear it. Some of the family? Yeah, that's an early Claybourne over there. - Your mother? - Uh-huh. - She's grand. - It's the only memory I have of her. She died when I was very young. Uh, that was a great old guy over there. He sailed a whaler out of New Bedford. Tough old bird, he had a wooden leg and a glass eye. Which is the glass eye, the one on the right? Yeah, how did you know? Oh, I don't know, it has a kinder expression than the real one. - She's lovely. - Well, now... You just sit down here. I'm going to leave you for a few minutes. Too bad I didn't bring my knitting. Golly, this place just reaks of 1936. - No wonder you go places. - You're going to be alright now? Oh, sure... They're in bed, huh? Yes, well, Tom always turns in early... ...and so does Dad when he gets a chance. I'll be seeing you. Don't you think you ought to wait until morning to tell them? I mean, about me. Oh, I won't disturb Dad, but you gotta meet Tom tonight. Oh... go ahead, Chris. Oh, Chris! - Yes? Hm... nothing. I keep babbling because I'm afraid to let you out of my sight. Go ahead, make the world face a democracy. I'll think about you when I go over the top. Is that you, Dad? Hospital wants you. No, it's me, I'll be right up. You remember me, don't you? I'm your brother. - Where's Dad? - Out on an emergency. I might have known there was a woman in back of this. Haven't seen hide nor hair of you for ten days. - Who is she? - Oh, she's great. Look, did you ever meet a girl who... ...makes you feel as if the moon had just shot over the mountain tops? Who is she this time? - You wouldn't know her. - How long have you? Oh, about two weeks. Ten days to be exact. - Where did you meet her? - Crystal Club. Some girl you picked up in a gambling house? - Cut that out, Tom. - What does she do for a living? Models clothes. Nice figure, huh? How would you like it if I talked that way about Mary? Now listen, kid. Mary and I have been knocking around together since we were in highschool. She expects very little. I don't even have a chance to see much of her, but I know she's there. Always in the background, something I'm working for. Not very romantic, perhaps, but... it's the kind of anchorage that doesn't pull loose with the first heavy gust of wind. Well, don't get the wrong slant about Rita. Come on downstairs and meet her, huh? - You brought her to this house? - Yeah. That shows you how much I think of her. We're getting married tomorrow. Nice going. You're going to ask this girl to throw over the high spots... ...and spend her honeymoon in a fever-infested jungle. Swell break for her. I'm not going, Tom - You're not what? - I'm not going! Now easy, kid. Nobody blames you for going haywire over a girl for a few days. You've got a tough assignment ahead of you. But when you talk of quitting, throwing away the chance to make a career for yourself. You're going on that boat tomorrow if I have to nail you to the mast. That scoundrel wouldn't let you leave town, huh? Right. If you stay, he'll pull you in anyway. - Thought I might go to Dad. - No, you don't! You know he's snowed under. Yeah, I know, I know... Ah, what right had you to gamble for that kind of dough? Oh, I don't know what I feel, it's like something you dig up under a rock. Ah, well, maybe I can dig it up for you, kid. Oh, I told Rita you'd help us. She doesn't enter into this. If I raise the money, it's on the one condition that you leave tomorrow. Nothing doing. But if she's the right kind of girl, she'll want you to go. You don't think we're in love, do you? Of course not. A couple of weeks whirling, dust in your eyes. If it is the real thing, she'll wait. - For two years... - I don't care if it's two hundred. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to us to play the game according to rules. Now let's go down and talk to this lady. If she is a lady, it'll be okay. Now wait a minute. Don't try to stampede me into this thing, will you? Alright, stay and marry her. Dad won't let you go to jail. Let him squeeze another mortgage on the hospital, give up your job, play around and have fun. The old man will pay the piper. Oh, I wish you weren't always so darn right. Come on, let's talk to the lady. My brother Tom. Good evening, or... good morning. How do you do, Miss... I'm afraid he's a little remissive about names. Maybe he's forgotten mine. It's Wilson, Rita Wilson. At the moment. Er, I'm sorry we kept you waiting so long, Rita. Oh, that's alright. I'm afraid I owe you an apology about my getup. Oh, it is a little late, but it suits you. Um, Tom's going to try to help out. You said he would. I guess I'm a bit of a shock to you, huh? Oh, no, not at all. Cigarette, dear? No, thanks. Um... Wouldn't we all feel a lot more chummy if you both sat down? Listen to me. Anybody would think I lived here. I suppose, Miss Wilson, Chris has told you about our financial status, and... ...the opportunity he has to advance himself professionally. Of course, why? Well, you see, Rita, What's the matter with the lights in here? It's a little depressing, isn't it? Hmm... And getting a little cold, isn't it? How about some coffee, Rita? No... I guess I can take it on an empty stomach. You're going tomorrow, aren't you? Yes. Well, that's all I was waiting for, I... - ...had to know. - Not so fast, Rita. - We want you to understand the situation. - I think I do. It wasn't easy for me to make this decision. No, brother Tom helped you, didn't he? I tried. It's a very important step in his life. - What about my life? - He has definite obligations. Is your brother lending you the money for Fish-Eye? Is that the hammer over your head? Let me answer that. I may not be able to raise the money. In which case, Chris's career will be completely shot. But if I do, it will be on the one condition that he leaves tomorrow. - Was all this rehearsed upstairs? - Don't talk like that, Rita. Tom's only trying to help me over a tough spot. Meaning me? - Now, listen, darling, when I come back... - When you come back. That makes brother Tom laugh, doesn't it, when you come back. In a couple of days you'll be saying, too bad she fell on my neck. Too bad she had no dignity. Too bad she did a lot of things. Rita, I know how you feel, but I do wish... ...you wouldn't jump to a lot of ridiculous conclusions. Ridiculous is right. I'd be crazy to waste any more time on this fake setup. Now, listen. I want to talk to you alone. - Let me take you home. - You're not taking me anyplace. You're to good a talker and I'm too big a sap. You win, brother. You've saved the family honor. You know as well as I do... ...that the stray cat he brought home has been heaved back over the fence. Wait a minute. You know perfectly well she's right. I know perfectly well you're making a mess of things. Rita! Rita! Hey, Rita, wait a minute! You can't go away like this. Hi, Chris. Who's the lassie? I'm sorry I wasn't home for dinner tonight, Dad. Oh, that's alright. It's been a long time since a young lady left this house so... so fast. And so early. Or so late. Hello, Tom. Now I know it's respectable. The hospital was trying to reach you about an hour ago. I know. I talked to them. You know, it makes me a little bit sad to see these trunks. But mighty proud. I was reading about you in this paper. - Very exciting. - He doesn't think so. Ten years from now he'll know what it means. An assignment with Fahrenheim. A chance to make your mark. - I'll go to bat this time. - That's the spirit. Just remember that when I pass on... ...there won't be a loose nickel for you to frolic with. You're brilliant and an awful idiot. But I love you. Right back at you, sir. It's mighty tiresome learning to be of service, isn't it? But once it gets under your skin, Chris, then you've really got something to live for. - Well, see you in the morning. Good night. - Good night. We're pretty proud of our lad, aren't we, Tom? Oh, I wouldn't go quite that far. Hey, hey, snap out of it. The girl isn't worth a second thought, Chris, take it from me. Listen, Tom, I can't take it from you. I can't take it from anybody. You've done plenty for me tonight. I'd like to say I'm grateful, but... ...somehow I wish I'd told you to go straight to the devil. Good night. Sit down. I figured you'd come back sooner or later. - Is that proposition still hot? - Sizzling. - Well, I'll need an advance. - Sure. - Will a century help out? - No, but five grand will. - You sure got a sense of humor. - Oh, I don't need it in cash. You got a sucker's check with the name Claybourne name scrawled across it. What are you going to do with it? Put him behind the bars if he don't come across. - I'll take it and lower the commission. - Now, listen. I know you're a smart girl alright, or I wouldn't be talking business with you. But don't try and get too smart. If I were smart, I wouldn't be buying a bum check, would I? Why, I'll bring guys in this joint that you'll shake loose of more than that. I'm not arguing about that. But that check is a kind of a personal matter with me. Kind of personal with you too, I guess, eh, baby? You figure it out. I'm tired. - Is it a little go? - Always willing to take a little gamble. Sure you are. When the cards are stacked right. Here it is, baby. But you don't get it until you've worked it off. Okay. I'll start punching the clock tomorrow night. Oh, by the way. There'll be a man around to see you in the morning. A bird that leans way backwards with a holier than thou attitude. That's the brother, you can't miss him. He's got little wings sprouting out of his shoulder blade. He'll try and make a deal with you. Just tell him it's paid. No names mentioned, no post-mortems. - Just don't let him pay, get me? - Yes, I get you, plenty. Hey, Rita. What surprises me is why a swell-looking girl like you always falls for a piker. You said it. But I'm the kind of a gal who... Well... who makes them feel as if the moon had just shot over the mountain tops. Good evening, sir. This way, please. The boss will be tied up for a while, doctor. - He says to make yourself comfortable. - Thanks. Good evening, Dr. Claybourne. - Remember me? - Yes, I remember you, of course. - Don't get up, I work here. - Oh, I beg your pardon, I... - I was rather surprised. - Wouldn't you like something to drink? No, thank you. - Mind if I sit down? - Please do! I have. Have you heard from Chris? - Yes. Have you? - Of course not. We said bon voyage and adi?s at the house that night. - Oh, it's better that way. - Much better. How did you know Chris and I were kidding ourselves? You did know. You were just as sure then as you are now. It's only horse sense, isn't it? Doesn't it make you squirm sometimes to see people make such awful fools of themselves? Why discuss it? Well, I'm glad you know I didn't mean Chris any harm. But it was New York, and spring, and... That always does something to me. Do you know you're an entirely different girl tonight? Not a trace of a neurotic. Chris was very fortunate to be able to spend the last few days... ...with you before he went into the wilderness. Thank you. I think he was even more fortunate to have you help him out of that financial jam. You know, a rather strange thing happened about that. Tell me about it. When I came here the next morning, the proprietor told me that Chris's debt had been settled. With no other explanation. I was rather mystified, but... very pleased because I had only been able to raise $2.500... ...and I was going to have to ask him to accept my note for the rest. He, uh... he didn't give you the check, did he? No, he didn't. That's why I'm here tonight. I phoned several times, it worries me. Oh, well, I don't want you to worry, Dr. Claybourne, but... that check will never be used against Chris. Promise not to misunderstand if I explain something? Yes, I think so. Well, you see, I like Chris. Oh, nothing serious, but he was fun. Maybe I thought I was in love with him... Anyhow, that doesn't matter. You made me realize how his career depended upon that expedition. I... I had a little money my grandmother left me and... I came around here that night and settled with Fish-Eye. Was that a very underhanded thing to do, Dr. Claybourne? Underhanded? Why, it was most generous. Of course, you'll be repaid just as soon as I can... Oh, I don't need it. There's no hurry. - Here's to Chris? - No. No, here's to you. I'm afraid I owe you a very humble apology. No, you don't. You owe me a dance. It'll be a pleasure. It must take a lot of idlers to support a fool's paradise like this. Life is just a straight road the way you see it, isn't it? - Why not? - Oh, I don't know. I had a crazy idea it was like a river. It goes winding around, trees hanging over it, a quiet little pool... And then sometimes it goes like the devil. Listen to me telling you. Couldn't you skip the hospital for one night? Oh, I'm afraid not. Please stay. It's grand to be with a man who doesn't know what you look like. Or care if you're young or old. You know, doctor, a girl likes to think she has a mind. You have a lot of character. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I dance atrociously. - Even Mary complained. - Mary? Yes, my fianc?e. But I don't get a chance to dance much nowadays. I'd never notice. You know, Rita, I'm not sure that I don't know what you look like. Thank you for the compliment. And don't worry, I know you don't mean it. My dear father always used to say to me, it's much better to be good friends with one strong man... ...than to go stumbling around with a lot of galoots. There's the mail! Hooray! Whoopie! The mail! Oh, boy! Come on, come on, get in there! Open up! I gotta have one this time, Charlie. Come on, snap into it, hurry up. Any more for me? Come on... I know I got two more in there. Come on, get down to it. Hurry it up, will you? Heat... stink... failure. Last week, and the week before, and before, and before! Mein liebe, failure is the only road to success. Well, you can fail just as well where you can put on a clean shirt... ...and go out and get a drink, can't you? Blizzards are still raging throughout the Middle West. Overnight, six inches of snow fell in New York. Blizzards in New York and 130 degrees here, aren't we lucky. Yeah, Pop, You gotta take yourself mighty seriously... to stay buried alive in a place like this for a fantastic theory... ...that some bug, some particular kind of tick, is holding back the millenium. Ya, but we are getting closer, immer closer mit every failure. We stumble in the dark, it makes you feel your way... That's what we are doing. Process of elimination. Okay, Pop. Process of elemination. There were seven of us when we came down here, now there are five. Your process is sure fine. Chris, you aren't getting scared, are you? Hey, I didn't say it, don't look at me. Chris, what have you in mind to do? I came a long way for this tick fantasy. And I never believed it. I never said I did. Wait a minute, Chris! We've made a hundred tries on a hundred natives... ...and eighty percent of them are dead. The guinea pigs live, the natives die. What a bunch of scientists we are. She says her husband died with fever. The child is sick, will we please save her. Get out of the way. Here we go, little girl. Paregoric. Er, sofrer el estomaco. No fever, no fever. Muito obrigado, muito obrigado. Pretty swell, isn't it? Yeah, we cured a baby with a belly ache. That's great work. Science is marvelous, but I'm sick of it! There's a boat going north. There's a boat going north and I've just got time to make it. Who is she, Chris? You know you can't fool me so easy. There's no use lying to you, is there, Pop? Alright, I won't. I'm packing. And if anybody here will call it quitting, say it after I've gone, because I won't take it! Every time that mails comes in you guys have something to look forward to. But I haven't! There's somebody that I've got to have a look at. Even if it's only a short squint. That's why I'm taking that boat. And when I come back, if you're still alive, I'll tell you again that I think you're crazy as a loon. Well, so long, pals! Cheer up! We're not failures. No, the miracle of the baby with the colic... will keep the natives shouting hosannahs till I see you again. What is it, Miss Spencer? Oh, they're preparing the patient for number 7, doctor. Alright, let me know as soon as you're ready. Yes, sir. Well? It isn't easy for me to say it. The board of directors asked for my resignation. I couldn't defend you. Why should you? Oh, why didn't you let me chuck it all weeks ago? Because you're mentally sick and I can't make a diagnosis without your help. We don't have to go into all that again, do we? Tom, it isn't like you. It isn't like any of the Claybournes to quit. - Look what Chris is doing out there. - Yes, look what Chris is doing. But don't you think you owe yourself something? Ours isn't an easy trade. It takes a lot of sweat and blood to write Md. after your name. Well, some people like responsibility. I begged you to go away somewhere for a few months. A team of mules couldn't drag me out of New York. - After a rest, you could come back here... - No, wait a minute. What would have happened to old Brooks if Dr. Peters... ...hadn't come in the operating room just when he did? - Now listen... - I' have lost my patient, wouldn't I? I bungled it. My mind wasn't on my job. Well, it still isn't. What's the answer? It's the breaking of your engagement to Mary that's at the back of all this. Merry Christmas! Hiya, Dad, you old rascal! I'm glad to see you! How are you, anyway? Hello, Tom, turn around here. Let me look at you. What's the matter with you? You're all red... You... Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's the matter with you guys here? Say, if ever I saw two fellow who needed a cheery word, you look it. Now wait a minute. If these sour looks are for me, you're all wrong. I'm on a definite leave of absence from Dr. Fahrenheim. You know, I thought it would be a grand idea... Well, if the Claybournes forgot about humanity for a week or so and, er... said... said hello, hi-ho, cheerio, and Merry Christmas. Well, I'm glad to see you, Chris. Well... what's the matter with you? What's wrong with Tom over here? Maybe he'll tell you. But whatever the trouble is, he hasn't given me his confidence, or Mary Alright, there's another woman, does that satisfy you? - You're in love with her? - Yes, sir. Do you think she's worth all this? - No. - Tom... Decent women don't wreck us. Do you want to tell us who she is? She's my wife. Dr. Claybourne Senior, wanted in operating room number 7. Talk to him, Chris. He needs us. Dr. Claybourne Senior, wanted in operating room number 7. It may interest you to know... ...that they're not using the word junior around this hospital anymore. Come on, old man. What's all this about? About something that doesn't concern you any longer. Hey, what the devil are you talking about? You say that you're married and it isn't to Mary. Who is she? She makes you think the moon had suddenly shot up over the mountain tops. What are you talking about? You don't remember ever saying that, hm? I said that the moon had... - You don't mean... - Right, boy. Rita? - You're married to Rita? - Yeah. But it wasn't the moon. It was more like thunder and lightning. Why did that girl marry you? Why did she do it? - To get even with the Claybourne tribe. - But you? I fell in love with her, I'm still in love with her head over heels. Now she's my business. You keep out of this. Where is she? Timbuktu, so far as I'm concerned. And wants no part of me since the night we ratted out a minister in Greenwich. She laughed all the way home in the taxi. I'll never forget that laugh. Nor the way she looked at me when I tried to put my arms around her. Then she kept looking at me. When we hit Central Park, she stopped the taxi. Goodbye, she said, I'm getting out of here. No other explanation? Oh, yes, it seems she was a little tight when she married me, I... I was cold sober. Then... haven't been since. - Divorce her! - Divorce, she's in my blood. The only satisfaction I have is she is my wife. I warn you, Chris, you keep out of this. You can't do me any good. Look, old man, what chance do you think you have with a girl like that? I know Rita! Well... I know her now, at any rate. Well, here's one thing you don't know. Five thousand dollars to Fish-Eye, remember that? She paid it. Her money kept you out of jail. She paid my debt? Why did she do that? Why? She was in love with you. Where do you think a girl like Rita gets that kind of money? Did you ever try to figure that out? No. Well, she did! That kind of money kept the Claybournes out of hock. So she thought she could buy me, huh? And her money served another purpose, didn't it? It won your confidence. Oh, look, Tom, a thing like this can drag you way under. You're too loyal, too decent... ...to even realize the kind of gutter you're walking in. It doesn't mean anything to her. She's just laughing at us. Yeah... maybe there's a way to stop that laugh. Well! - How are all the little bugs? - Fine. Only it seems that they're not all in the jungle. Could it be that you have a pretty dangerous one in your head, Rita? Why did you marry Tom? Strange world, isn't it? No, no... it's the people in it. Who would have thought Mrs. Claybourne... ...would spend Christmas Eve with her brother-in-law? Proving that there is a Santa Claus. The night I changed my name to Claybourne... ...I wrote you the longest letter I've ever written in my life. - I didn't get it. - Oh, no, I tore it up. Oh, what a shame that such a literary masterpiece should be lost to the world. Oh, but it wasn't. I sent it to the museum marked, uh... "Contribution From a Female Architect." Meaning what? A designing woman. That's supposed to be funny, Chris. Why don't you laugh? You used to talk straight, Rita. Why did you marry Tom? Oh, because he was trying to save you from me... ...and I thought he might as well make a good job of it. Nobody can save me from you. What did you want to gain? Come on, let's have it straight. Because I saw red in a chance to get even. It was all so easy. I didn't even care about that girl. I wanted to hurt. Hurt anything within striking distance. He took you away from me and... Well, two can play that game. Too lowdown to understand, Chris. If you hadn't played it so low, we'd have wound up together. Rough going, maybe, but sure as you live. Well, er... there's one other little matter that I should thank you for. It's quite a new sensation for me using a woman's money to pay my gambling debts. Pretty risky, wasn't it, Rita? Bad insurance. At the moment, my worldly possessions amount to exactly $711 Oh, quit it, Chris, will you? And, uh... it's going to take me quite a while... ...to pay you back the balance in nickels and dimes Yes, $711. Seven hundred and... Seven eleven Say, I got a hunch. - I feel lucky. - Oh, don't, Chris! You haven't a chance, I know. Now, come on, I want to see if I can't protect your investment. It's good for eight hundred. Alright, here we go. If you don't like six and five, make it a two and five. There you are. Number 7, the gentleman wins! Same dice if you don't mind. A C on one and a C on the other. One's for Chris, the other's for Claybourne. Alright, let's shoot for a thousand. Keep going, Chris, it seems like it's your night to howl. Hear what the lady says? Let's go, here we go! - Eleven! - You won again! Here we go, rolling on... - You're working for me, aren't you? - Sure I am. - Then get that mug over to the wheel. - He won't play roulette. Likes dice better? See he plays with these. - Oh, have a heart, Fish-Eye. - You heard what I said. - Don't make me cross that guy. - Pick up them dice. Nothing doing. You figure I should pay a dividend just because you're mushy about a guy, hm? You'd rather see him behind bars than give him the cross, hm? Remember you haven't finished working off that check yet. - I can still slap down on him. - You wouldn't do that. Wouldn't I? Get me O'Hara. - No, no! - Hold the phone a minute. Now pick up them dice. I'm watching those babies, they're pals of mine. Square on all corners. Right. Remember now, you're straight from Santa Claus. Straight from Santa Claus, we want the six and the fives. - Six and the fives. - Keep it going, Chris. Roll them while they're hot. Uh-huh, straight from Santa Claus, a six and a five. How are you, Fish-Eye? Shooting for five hundred, there we go. Eight. Eight's the point... that's very easy. We sure gotta learn it the hard way. We've done it before, we'll do it again. Okay, two little honeys, two little pieces of dynamite. Let me roll them for you once. Oh, no, no, I'm in a streek. Eight's the point. You can do an eight, I just saw you do it, whisper to me. Yes, the baby's going to do an eight right back, there we go. - What have we got? - Eight it is, right back. Please let me roll them, just once. No, no, no, I'm sorry to refuse a lady, but uh... Uh... how much ahead did you say I am here? - Oh, a little over five thousand. - A little over five thousand, eh? Alright, alright, go ahead and roll them. I got a cramp in the arm anyway. You'll all enjoin before I'm finished with this roll. Put it on the line, we'll shoot for the five thousand. - The lady's shooting five thousand. - Uh... just a moment, please. The lady on my left is shooting, er... a dollar twenty-five, thirty-five... a dollar and seventy-five cents. And here they go. Twelve's a loser. - How much is it there? - Fifty-three hundred. I'll pay off. Well, every sucker has one good hour coming to him, hasn't he, Fish-Eye? Uh-huh. What do you say if we three pals have a drink, huh? Come on, now, and I don't want no for an answer. Did, uh... she tell you she changed her name to Claybourne? No. - No? - No. She didn't tell you she married my brother? Why, no. - No? - No. Oh, I see, just a couple of gabby people, huh? Purely business hook up. Well, there's your money, Rita. And thanks very much. What's the matter, Fish-Eye, something wrong with that drink? No, it's okay. - Another martini, please. - Para usted? One and a two, craps again. Wasn't it lucky that I stopped rolling them when I did? - Let me see them dice. - No, no, wait a minute. I want to keep these as souvenirs. - Come out a minute, boss. - Okay. See you later. Is it that old gag about not if I see you first? Having a good time, Rita? Less than a minute. Doesn't seem like Christmas, does it? It's alright with me. Ah, there's something about this I can't take. - A moment like this in this joint. - Can I go too? - Go where? - Any place you like. - Chris. - Hm? Aren't you going to kiss me? You're my brother's wife, Rita. I wouldn't even hold your hand while that condition exists. But you want to, don't you? No, no, I came up here to see what kind of a hat you were wearing. I'm ashamed of what I did to Tom and that girl, really ashamed. - What are we going to do, Chris? - Ride around Central Park for a while. We can't do that for the rest of our lives. How long would it take me to get a divorce? A lifetime in this state. He won't give you any evidence, Rita. You could make him give me a divorce. Why should he? Leaving things as they are is a swell way to get even. When you do a lowdown trick it comes right back at you, doesn't it? You're just finding that out, huh? No time and plenty of distance is your only remedy. Say, do you want to take a gamble? - Sure, if you roll the dice. - It's got to be played strictly to rules. You name them. Alright, there's a fruit boat leaving at six a.m., can you make it? That's part of the rules. Are you hungry, Astrid? Here. - Breakfast, milord. - Okay. - Good morning, se?or. - Good morning. - Hear how Charlie is? - Still unconscious. Pete's with him. You didn't go near that bunk room, did you? Oh, just for a little while. I tried to help out a bit. - I told you not to. - Oh, Chris, I'm not scared of spotted fever. You told me yourself a hundred times it doesn't spread by contact. Yeah, stay away from there. What a city, huh? Yeah. Looks like something that fell off from the back end of a truck. I trust the se?or will enjoy the breakfast I have prepared for him. I heard you slamming around the laboratory most of the night. Drink your coffee. That boat's due in today or tomorrow. I've been listening for the whistle. Go ahead and eat. You don't eat enough, you don't sleep enough, you smoke too much and you work too hard. You're not having very much fun, are you? Are you? All I know is I'm in the same place you are. I don't care very much how I got here as long as I'm here. Listen, can't we get along without all that till we're out in the clear? Okay. Why isn't every man a scientist? Do you know there's more romance in a laboratory... ...among picks and tubes than in all the nighclubs in Manhattan? There isn't anything more exciting than making nature open its secrets. And if... ...if I ever have a son, that's what he'll do too. Sit down, it's only a freighter. I saw it coming through the reef this morning. You're driving yourself nuts. Eat your breakfast! Oh, coffee's all I need, then I got to get back to the laboratory. You know, I've had a crazy notion for the last week or so... ...that Tom hated me so much he might not bother about a divorce. Well, isn't there any kind of a divorce you can get around here? Hm-hmm, they kill each other down here when they don't like them. You see what happens? Listen Chris, if there's no news when the boat does come... Then what? Let Pop sleep it out. He was up most of the night with Charlie. He hasn't moved since you left. Guess he's going out, alright. - Good morning, Pop. - Good morning, Rita. - Did you have a good sleep? - Not a blink. One mosquito got down underneath my net and I fight it all night. And it won. - Do Chris go to work? - Yes. I'm so tired mit starvation. You worked all night on poor Charlie, didn't you? I'd kiss you if you weren't so hungry. I'm sorry I'm so hungry. Why won't Chris let me help with Charlie? There are lots of things I could do. Nein, nein, Rita. Chris is right. But I thought nursing was a woman's job. Ah, but little Rita, this is different. Always I tell Chris you should not be here. Oh, if you love me, Pop, don't put that idea in his head. Another papaya? Nein, danke. He goes and gets you here. I think you make marriage and honeymoon, but no, you wait. Now, you do love him, you're a good cook... What more he wants? Well, there's still a little question of a paper from New York that'll say I'm free. - I hope it comes soon. - So do I. I have a hunch it'll be on this next boat. Claybourne wants you right away! Charlie's dying. No... no! His pulse is rapid and thready. Hemorrhages in the skin, ecchymosis is present. Charlie. Charlie, come on. Try and tell us. Did you drink water that hadn't been boiled? No... water. Ticks... ticks... Ticks. That hallucination will go to the grave with all of us. Typhus is spread by lice, malaria by mosquitoes, sleeping sickness by the tse-tse fly. But spotted fever by what? Ticks... Ticks... Most merciful God, we who put our trust in Thee, pray that Thou shalt spare this man. He has sacrificed his health for the good of his fellowmen. We ask Thy mercy to restore it back to him, provided this will be for his soul's welfare. That he does, he may praise and magnify Thy holy name. Amen. Hey, Pop! Pop, come here! Pete. - What is it, Chris? - The ticks. Ticks, it's always ticks. But this time I think I've got an idea. Come on! Get one of those jars and a pair of gloves. Wunderbar! Wunderbar! We made him sick, alright. Now can we cure him. These ticks... ticks fetter infected animal blood that are carriers of the fever. They made the guinea pigs sick. The goat which carried them was not sick. The goat must have developed immunity. The goat's blood must be the source of our serum. - How's Charlie? - Hardly breathing. Hurry, Chris, hurry! Harry milked a goat and he died. Charlie milked a goat and he's dying. The solution under our eyes while thousands die. Ticks fed on infected animals' blood... ...while we fool around with ticks from weeds and thistles. Funny, isn't it? Good men, aren't we? Your riddle, you've found the answer. - If we save Charlie that'll be the answer. - Hurry, Chris, hurry! Still he breathes. A flicker of life left. He rise. He breathes deeper. His pulse gets stronger. More blankets. Nein... he doesn't need them anymore. - We failed again. - Nein, nein. You succeed. You were right with the serum. But too far gone he was. The heart wouldn't stand the strain. Oh, stop it, will you? Stop it! Chris, Chris, come on. Come on, Chris. - I'll get some coffee. - Nein, nein. The priest gave us some after we put Charlie to rest on the hillside. Rest. I wonder if anybody could rest in that sun-baked desolation. What can we do with him? - He's in a bad mood. - Oh, he's tired and shocked to pieces. Listen, Chris, Charlie didn't die in vain. You're on the right track, you know that. Oh, cut it out, Rita, it's too warm. Well, the boat's in. I'm going down to the wharf. - I've already been. - Any mail for me, Rita? - The Medical Journals, perhaps? - A whole slew of them. Well, thank you. Maybe this will cheer you up. What is it? It's good news, isn't it? Good? This is a lot better than good. Why, you... You don't sound very cheerful. There's your passage back to New York and all the money I've got. Fish-Eye gave you 10%, well and I'm giving you 100%, and bon voyage. - What does it mean, Chris? - That you're going home. This is your finish so far as the Claybourne tribe's concerned, so get yourself together. That boat's sailing tomorrow and you're going back on her, and good hunting. - No, wait a minute, let me get this. - You got it, all of it. There's just one word. Scram. I thought we were waiting for this, both of us. I thought we were going to be married. You're not very smart, are you, Rita? Marry you? Tom was a particular kind of sap, he never met anything like you before in his life. He needed the lesson that you taught him. Wait a minute, this is unfair. If I can only get it straight. - Say it right. - Say it anyway you like. Oh, will you stop hammering me and listen? - All I can think of is I love you. - Yeah... ...a jungle cat can love something or other. You either have to kill her or get away from her. Oh, I despise myself for what I did to Tom, but... I couldn't think. Hopeless days, endless nights... That's what love can do for you, Chris, the kind of love I have for you. When you came back, the moment I looked at you, well... You saw what happened. You're the only girl in the world that I ever wanted to pay for the whole works. Right now you're not worth the price you're asking, and that's nothing. Oh, go ahead, whip me with all he words you want to. All these months we've been waiting I've sensed your restlessness. But I thought it was because you wanted to break down the barriers and... ...your code wouldn't let you. And I loved and respected you for it. I wouldn't let one minute of the rest of my life depend on you, not a minute! What kind of a deal did you think you were giving me when you brought me down here? I wasn't thinking about you, I was thinking about my brother. And uh... a few other things. Okay. If you figure I had this coming to me, why... there's... nothing more to be said. I only know I love you. I'll love you till I die. But that's no weapon to fight through your blind arrogance. And now let's call it a day. - Chris, I want to tell you what I think... - Oh, forget it, Pop. I'm checking out. All this time she's been so patient. So willing to work. Why you bring you here to make a fool of her? Oh, that's a specialty of hers making fools of people. Oh, hello, doctor. C?mo est?, usted? Good afternoon, gentlemen. Come in, won't you? Please take a seat. I think you have not met Captain Tanetz. - How do you do? - Se?or. I am the aide to his excellency the governor. Doctor Capolo, Doctor Gracioso. How do you do? Se?or doctores, by order of his excellency the governor, your permit to practice in this province or enter the interior is revoked. Revoked, why? Your experiments are a failure, no? Yes, very definitely, until last night, but now we hope to accomplish what we came here for. Yes, gentlemen! Claybourne has a serum found. Yet last night one of your party died. And through his death we think we've stumbled on the right track. Yet you were unable to save him with the serum. We administered too late, but with the guinea pig we... You succeed with animals, eh? With humans, no. We plan to on going to the mines in the interior where the fever's most rampant. Testing out his serum on a case that wasn't so far advanced. - And if the man shoud die? - Oh, he'd die anyway! Se?ores, se?ores, permit me to make it all clear. Some of our people survive this fever even without help. - Your treatments only excites fear. - And symptoms. And symptoms. Well, it's a normal scientific risk, isn't it? A risk his excellency, by my advice, will no longer tolerate. Therefore, se?ores, I warn you, it is unlawful that you practice on any of our citizens. - Outrageous, this. - What is this a lot of filthy politics? If we have found a cure and you bozos are afraid of losing your jobs? - Se?or... - Please, Chris. Gentlemen, it's your people we are trying to help. Ya, we have nothing to gain. S?, se?or doctor, our people. But I warn you. If any of them should die with your treatment, you shall be indicted for murder. Good afternoon, se?ores. Good afternoon, se?ores. Good afternoon, se?ores. Chris, I'm... I'm terribly sorry this happened to you. It's an old story, little Rita. Science has always had to fight superstition and ignorance. Yeah, and from now on I want what my hands can feel and my eyes can see... and the deep dark secrets can stay up in the cosmic spaces. Oh... quitting? You'd better get your things and go up to the hotel, Rita. Listen... If you try out this serum on any citizen of this rathole, they'll jug you, right? Ya. But you could do as you darn well please with me, couldn't you? - I have faith in your serum. - Nein, nein! Oh, you need a human guinea pig and I'm applying for the job. What do you say, Chris? I say it's a nice, grandstand play for your exit. - But I mean it. - I know you do, Rita. And she know's there aren't two men on the face of the earth... ...who'd infect a woman with a deadly disease for a risky experiment. Sounded good, didn't it? Chris, you're more stupid then those men who just went out of here. Oh, I'm a sap, Pop. Have my baggage sent over, will you? If there's... If there's anything I've forgotten, shove it along too. Bye, you old darling. So long, Chris. I'll see you to the hotel. The good, old-fashioned Claybourne chivalry, huh? Tear them to pieces, but tip your hat to them on the way out. You're not taking me anyplace. Thanks for the boat ride and the humiliation. Chris, you are an idiot! Love! It puzzles me more than science. I don't know what to make of you, Chris. There's a great chance for all of us to dramatize ourselves, isn't there? A chance to be heroes and they won't let us. I speak of Rita. For one second of her life she was right. It's when she said this place fell off the back of a truck. Yes, sir, a garbage truck. Let's go into town and get a drink, Pop. Nein, nein, I'm in no mood. Maybe I get drunk when I cure someone. Adi?s, se?or. XXX The boat not leave until after siesta time. Yeah, well I'm going on board and sit in the boiler room. It'll be a nice, cool change after that bedroom you gave me. - Hey, young lady! - Hello, Pete! - What are you all dressed up for? - Back to the States on this boat. Dr. Fahrenheim paid me off before they went upriver. - Up the river? - Yes, the laboratory near the deserted mines. Nothing can make those birds quit. They've got moods like prima-donnas, but they've got what it takes. I guess you have to have to be in that racket. - How about a gin and lime? - No, I'm going aboard. When they left last night, I wanted to go with them. But they said no, too risky. What do you mean risky? They're going to squirt the tick juice into Claybourne. What? Hey, bring back that baggage! And the only way to stop them is to have them arrested and brought back. Do you wish your friends put in jail? Sure, I'd rather have them there than six feet under the ground. It is a serious thing to disobey the order of this administration. Of course it is, that's what I'm driving at. You're the boss. I shall take steps that my orders are not disobeyed. I knew you would. But you've got to do it at once before it's too late. Se?orita, you arrive in the middle of my siesta. But later I will take the matter up with Captain Tanetz. But I've just come from him. You go to Tanetz first before you come to Capolo? Why sure, er... I didn't want to disturb you. - I wash my hands of it. - But listen... Se?orita, I worked hard all the morning. - I want my siesta... Adi?s. - I'll go to the governor. With the election coming on, it will be hard to find him, to know who is the governor. You may even be speaking to him now, se?orita. Ugh! Nein, nein, it is not right. You are young and I am old. It is not fair, what do I know about dice? Aw, what are you mumbling about, Pop? Ah, I should have played pinochle. I play good pinochle. You did alright at dice, you won, didn't you? Yes, but if it had been pinochle, maybe I lose. Ah, stop crabbing, I lost, it's my party. Well, everything's all ready. What are we waiting for? Maybe we haven't got enough serum, Chris. Oh, stop stalling, Pop. Let's have a look. Oh, there's enough there for twenty injections. Chris like a murderer, I feel. Is that all the faith you've got in my serum? You were different back there when I was ready to quit. Yeah, my feet are much colder than yours are, Pop. Come on, give me a little moral support. Ya... but we wait till tomorrow, eh, Chris? We worked hard to make the serum, Tonight we relax, smoke... and talk. Yeah, by then the authorities find out we're up here and yank us back. Wait a minute, Chris. I fix you up something. Okay, Pop. Just as soon as you get drowsy, then I... I inoculate you. And you won't... you won't have so much time to think. Here. Drink this. If I swallow that, I'd go out like a light... ...and wake up in a couple of hours still hale and hearty. I'm ashamed of you, Pop. Oh, did... did I make it a little strong? Yeah, let's forget about that sleeping stuff. I'll do it myself. Give me some alcohol here, will you? Ya... wait a minute, Chris. I want to see if we have everything. Quit stalling, Pop. Here goes. Oh... Oh, I'm so sorry, I... I broke the serum tube, it slipped right out of my hand. You dropped that on purpose. - Why, Chris. - Now, don't why Chris me. Pop, when you try to be clever you're like an elephant toe-dancing. You knew that was the last serum we had and it'll take some time to make more. - It was all the fault of my monocle. - Oh, you darned old humbug. Chris, where you go? I'm going down to the goat corral to get some more blood. There it is. In back of the sugarcane. - Why, Rita! - Where is he? Where is who? The king of Siam, but I'll take Chris Claybourne instead! Where is he? Is he alright? - Of course he's alright. - Oh, cut the stalling, Pop. I know the layout, but I don't go through, see? You don't know how that stuff is gonna work. You know it's crazy. Sure, but if you love crazy people, you have to be crazy too. It's all my fault. I mean, the way he is. But I won't let him do it, you understand? I won't let him do it! Now, Rita, please. You know nothing will stop Chris Claybourne if he starts a thing. - Well, what are his chances? - Good, awful good. - How are you gonna do it? - It's simple. With this virus we inoculate him. And with the serum, please God, we save him. Death in one hand and uncertainty in the other. That's the ticket, isn't it? Ya, but I think he'll be alright, Rita. I'm glad you're here because he'll be very sick. And I will need you. He'll try and throw me out, but you won't let him do it, will you? We'll talk to him. He's in the compound, I go and call him. Chris! Oh, Chris! Now don't worry, don't worry. Chris won't send you back. No, I don't think he can now. What's the hurry, Pop? Well, well, well. No matter how you try to get away from me, I still find you, don't I? Yes, I, er... just dropped in on my way to a bridge party. Oh, I... thought you were more partial to dice. Pop, I... I've got a little case of the jitters, I... ...wonder if you could give me something to sort of quiet me down. Too much sun, I guess. Ya, tired you must be with the long journey. Here, take a couple of swallows of this. Not too much. It'll make you sleep. Sleep, that's okay with me. - Some food maybe you like? - No, this is all I need. We only have one bunk room here. Our hospitality is limited. - Yeah, I get it. Welcome, run off. - What did you expect? - Just what I'm getting. - Well, we've got a lot of work to do, so when you feel better, I'll take you down to your canoe. Wo, wo, wo, not any more, no. - Himmel! - What's the matter, Pop? Rita! You touch this? What did you do with this? Oh, give me the rest of this drink, will you? I've got the jitters, I tell you. Rita... Rita, you'll destroy yourself. My child, that's not right. You are so young with life. Right now I feel a thousand years old. Rita! - Rita! - It was an accident. You deliberately injected that virus into your vein? - I tell you it was an accident! - Oh, why did you let her do it, you fool? - Oh, Chris. - Pop, open up those curtains. - Rita, darling, why did you do it? - Oh, I'll come through alright, Chris... ...if you just keep your arms around me. I don't know if it's the dope Pop gave me or... something I see in your eyes, but... I feel swell. No serum. And I destroyed it. Oh, my throat is beginning to burn. Could the glands have started to act as quickly as that? If we only had the serum. That's our only chance. What are we waiting for? Come on. Why you stop? This is the first chance I've had to stop and think and I'm wondering if... Quick, inject it! - Suppose it was the serum that killed Charlie. - It's a chance you must take. It's easy to take chances with other people's lives. We took one with Charlie and his heart stopped. - Without the serum she might... - Give it to her I say! I can't do it, Pop, I can't! You are a coward! Makes you feel as if the moon had just shot over the mountain top. Seven come eleven, roll them while they're hot. You here me? Coward! - Give me that hypodermic... - Wait a minute, Pop! Stop hammering me and listen. All I know is I love you. I love you. In three months we shall return with the equipment for the new hospital. And now, ladies and gentlemen of the Rothmore Institute, in conclusion, I should like to say that I feel... ...entirely unworthy of the great honor you do me, and if there is credit due, and I'm sure there is, it belongs entirely to my wife. Uh, boy, would you hand the microphone to Mrs. Claybourne? It was a tough fight, Mom, but I won. Hooray! Mrs. Claybourne really doesn't feel that she deserves this beautiful silver tea set. All she asks is that a monument be placed side by side... ...with that of Florence Nightingale. With the simple inscription, "To the girl who knocked the spots off spotted fever.". Hooray! I'm glad you haven't forgotten how to be crazy, Chris. That's the kind of thing you're gonna have to face... ...when you get to New York, darling. - I love New York in May. - Even when it's October? Oh, let's always pretend it's May. Even when we come back with the hospital. And that's something to look forward to, to be useful. You're going to let me be, aren't you, Chris? When we come back, you give the orders, and I'll touch my cap. Say, we never got a captain's cap, did we? Now, Chris, be yourself, but don't be yourself! Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
