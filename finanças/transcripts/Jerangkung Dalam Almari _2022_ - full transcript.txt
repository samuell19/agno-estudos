Midah. Midah, drink this. Midah. Midah. Mom. Midah, let go of Fikri. Adam, have you forgotten what I told you? You can only use your phone on Saturdays and Sundays, right? Sorry, mama. I can play with this Saturday, right? Of course. You're mama's son, right? Promise, okay? -Promise. Can it be settled tonight? That's good, Pak Hassan. Around what time? That sounds great. Sure. Upon Gods will. And peace be upon you too. Now the zombie's dead. One, two, three, four, five,... ...six, seven, eight,... -Stop it, you'll ruin his shirt. ...nine, ten, eleven. Last night you seemed to have your night terrors again. Well, lately I've been missing my home village. Then why not just return? It isn't that far. I think it's a good idea if we take a visit. You know, since we got married,... ...you never introduced me to your brother and sister. You didn't even invite them to our wedding. This is how it is when you've lost your parents. Let's see later. Maybe after I've finished my work. Let's see. Adam, let's go. You're going to be late. Come. Enough with the phone. Give it to me. Come on. Listen to dad, Adam. -One,... ...two. Good boy. Here's his bag. -Come. As usual. One. -Get on dad's back. Okay. -Yes. Have a good day at school. God the Almighty. Forgive me, God. And peace be upon you too. I kind of nodded off just now. So, you've arrived for awhile? I just arrived. That thing has already arrived here. It knows. So we have to rush what we've been intended to do here. It's time. This is your chance,... ...for you to get rid of the disturbance which has always... ...haunted you all this while. I still remember... ...your late father when he left you with me 15 years ago. I've never seen him that scared. He was tremendously scared. Yes. He loved you. He saved you. Does your wife know... ...that you're learning all these things from me? No. -Nevermind. Just remember,... ...not only you who will experience this disturbance. Your wife and son may also experience it. But don't worry. Within time, when she experiences those things,... ...she'll come to terms with it. My wife's and child's love is my strength, Pak Hassan. You're right. If we desire to save other people,... ...we have to save our family first. When the time comes, you'll have to use this. I'll teach you how to use it, hold it and the incantation. What is this, Pak Hassan? Have a look for yourself. 3:03 AM How on earth did you get here? I was downstairs all this while. So, you want to refill this bottle? Then, who's in the room? Who? There's nobody here. Where did you go? I'm afraid, you know? Why did you leave me alone? Hey, I'm here now. I'm right here in front of you, okay? Adam's also there. So, don't be afraid, okay? Please? Please? Okay. It seems that Adam's door is ajar. Let me have a look for awhile. -Okay. Why are you bringing him in? -I just want to sleep with him. I miss him. Come. Wak? Are you okay? Please, Wak. My wife at home is extremely ill, Wak. What do you say if we pay Itah and Ali a visit? Okay. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Is there nobody home? Fikri. Fikri. I'm sorry because I ran a little late. It's all right. This is Shikin, my wife. How are you doing? -Fine. Oh, God. It brings such joy to see all of you. Adam, come over here. Shake hands with Auntie Itah. Shake Auntie Itah's hand. -Hey. Oh, God. So this is my nephew? You're so adorable. Where's Ali? He's inside. Come on, let's go inside. Come on in. It's a little untidy. So you've got lots of work? It's not a lot, it's just tonnes of work. You know, during these hard times. There are a lot of cases. -What kind of cases? Breakup cases. Make yourself at home. It's a little dusty. No problem. We're good. You could break that, Adam! Come over here. Sit down. Ali! Fikri's home. Come out. It's okay. I'll go and fetch him. Peace be upon you. Why are you home in all of a sudden? I miss you guys. Ali, let me introduce to you. Adam, come over here. Greet Uncle Ali. Shikin, this is Ali. -Ali. Dad, look at this. There are zombies. -Yes, there are zombies. So this is what my son is up to. -Adam, what did your teacher say? You can't be obsessed with those phone games, right? Enough, let's take a bath. Come on. -Did you hear what your mama said? Come on. So, Itah will be preparing your favourite dish, right? Itah's cooking is always great. But if you cook, it tastes even better. Yeah, nice try. Let's go take a bath. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone. Remember! Never spill the secret! You want this? -Ali. Ali. Are you okay, Ali? Ali. How are all the dishes? How are all the dishes? When Itah cooks, every meal is delicious. Well then, enjoy. Enjoy your food. Have you eaten? I've had a bite at the prayer hall. Are you deaf? I said I've had a bite at the prayer hall. Whose mobile phone is that on this table? Where are you table manners? It's Adam's. -From such a young age,... ...he's already used to using mobile phones. I think it's normal. Kids. Good, normalize it until they derail from creed. Have a good look at how western influence... ...has brainwashed and controlled our daily lives. Just imagine, children are already tainted with all these. This is polytheism! The deceiver! This is all polytheism! Mobile phones, TVs, computers. They're all the same! I'm sorry. He's always cranky like that. Do you know, Fik? When dad passed away, he always blamed himself. He said he wanted to leave all earthly matters behind. He just wanted to pray. It's almost 15 years he has been like that. Wasn't he an engineering graduate? It's such a waste to give all that up. It's a good thing I'm a public servant. Just let him be. I can be the bread winner. You're the bread winner? Of course, I'm the bread winner. Fik, would you like to visit mom's grave tomorrow? Do you still remember where are mom and dad's grave? Have you forgotten? I was too young at the time, right? Of course I wouldn't remember. -Yes, you're right. Itah. Does anybody stay in that room? Dad was the one using that room after mom passed away. I no longer go into that room. It gives me the creeps. Look, Adam. It's an album. Do you still remember, Fik? You used to love eating fruits there when you were little. That's our late mother's land. There's 10 acres,... ...but there's another five acres, you know? Is that so? -Of course. Mama, mama, mama! Forgive me, God. Adam! You scared me. Mama, there's a zombie in Uncle Ali's room. Again with the zombies? Didn't I tell you? Don't play too much mobile phone games. It's true, mama. There's a zombie. -Enough, Adam! I told you, stop it. But I left my mobile phone in Uncle Ali's room. Good. Let's eat first. After you've finished your lunch, you can go take your mobile phone. It's been half an hour already. Which one is it? Fik, what has happened to me? What do you mean? I can't remember when was the last time... ...I visited mom and dad's grave. I forgot. Yes, I have always mentioned that I usually give lectures... ...in open spaces. -Have a bite, honey. Usually, in Indonesia I give lectures in open spaces... ...because there are more people. -It's more spacious. Sometimes youngsters will come,... -Have some more, here. ...they ride motorcycles, they sit, they look from afar. And then they'll listen. Once, while having a roadside meal,... ...I saw this young man,... ...with his hair, you know, young people. He was wearing a ring, most of them had tattoos. He was staring at me, then...... No, mama. Yes, Ren? -Okay, I've managed to get... ...an appointment for you. When is that? -Tomorrow morning. Just bring your design. Morning? -Yes. Is there any other time? No, he's got a flight in the evening. I guess, that's all right. -Okay. See you tomorrow. -Okay. Honey, when are we going to go back home? Go home? Why can't we stay a little longer? Don't you feel it's kind of to soon? Everybody's working tomorrow, right? Furthermore, Adam has to go to school. Let everyone go to work. Adam can skip school. Itah will surely go to work tomorrow. So, you don't want to leave me alone with Mr. Weirdo, right? It's not nice to say that. I'm scared, you know. What do you have to be scared of? I'm here, okay? I need you here. I still haven't found my mom and dad's grave, you know. So imagine that. I know, Itah has already told me about that. Do you know what happened earlier today? Adam said he saw a zombie in Ali's room? I don't know, try and ask your son yourself. Adam. Come over to dad. I need to ask you something. Adam, did you see a zombie earlier today? Did you tell your mama? How did the zombie's face look like? It's face was like the one in my mobile phone game. Like in your mobile phone game? It's always the zombies from his mobile phone games. Where is your mobile phone, Adam? Tell your dad. What happened to your phone? Where's your phone? -It's with mama. Here. Who did this? Uncle Ali. Uncle Ali? -Yes. Is what Adam said is true? -I'm not sure. He said he left his phone inside Ali's room. And then, when Ali returned it, the phone was already broken. He's really weird. Itah? Help me, Itah. Please help me. -Ali? That thing has returned. Help me, Itah. That thing has returned. Enough already. Don't give excuses. You never believe what I say, right? That's just your excuse, isn't it? Because you're too lazy to work. Lazy bum! Ali. Ali! They're sleeping, okay? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Haunting me again. It came back. It really does exist. It really does exist. It's haunting me. Ali. Do you remember where mom's grave is? I couldn't find her grave. How could you find it? When was the last time you went? When? They day she passed away, right? The how on earth could you find it? Do you have to scold me? I feel bad, you know, because I couldn't take care of Fikri. I was busy, I had to work, I was staying at the hostel. I had no time to take care of him. So what's wrong that when he comes back,... ...we open our arms for him? Can't we do that? There's no difference if he comes back or not. You are just pretending. You treat them nicely when they come home. Before this, it was you who bad-mouthed them. Do you realize what they want? What are their intentions of coming home,... ...especially during these hard times? How could you say that? If Fikri didn't cause trouble and ran away from home,... ...our late dad wouldn't have passed away. He'd still be alive, got it? Since when did Fikri run away from home? There's no difference. All you talk about is Fikri. Remember what I've entrusted you with. Adam, papa is going to work. -Good morning. Yes, I forgot to tell you. I have a last minute meeting. It's really urgent. I'm so sorry. -Can't you have the meeting... ...another day? -No, because... ...Mr. Robert, he's flying off. If not I'm going to lose the deposit,... ...the contract agreement and everything. If I want for him to come back, it will be pending. Fine. -Ya, I've already told you... ...the reception in that area is very bad. Anything, I'll call. Hey, we've gone through this before, right? And the zombies, just don't think about them. They don't exist, okay? Please trust me. Have faith in God. Please. Okay, I'm your wife, right? I'm strong. Isn't that right, dear? -Yes, I'm strong too. Yeah! I'm leaving. -Okay. Adam, are you okay? Here, have a bite. Okay, good boy. Okey, Adam. After you've finished chewing,... ...drink this water, okay? Adam? Adam? Where did he go? Adam? Mama! Open this, mama! Open it! Mama, help open this! -Adam! Open it, Adam! Mama is here -Mama, open it! Mama, open it! Help! Mama, help me! Mama! Open it, Adam! Mama's here! -Mama! Adam! Adam, what are you doing there? Adam! Adam! Why were you heading for the woods, Adam? I just wanted to follow the old lady. Which old lady? There. Come on, Adam. Hold on. Come on. Adam! Adam! -Mama! Adam! Hey, it's me! What's the matter with you? -Adam, come to me. Come to me, Adam! I just saw your mother strangling Adam. My late mother strangling Adam? What do you mean? Earlier, Adam got trapped in the cupboard inside your mother's room. Now your mother was strangling Adam. Itah, did our late mom keep any jinn? Dad never mentioned about any jinn. Ali? -Don't talk nonsense. I'm not talking nonsense. I'm asking. Okay, I want to ask you this. Why did you come back? You never came back before. You never visited us. From Kuala Lumpur to this village... ...is only half an hour. Why did you come back? Tell me..... -I came back to get answers. Myself, my wife and child have experienced disturbances, you know? Shikin, what kind of disturbance did you experience? Sorry, Itah, but I saw Fikri's mom strangling Adam in that room. Did he tell you that? Did he? -No. I've never heard of stories or the news about... ...ghosts strangling people. There's no such thing. Adam. Tell me, where did you start experiencing disturbances? In that room. Please don't go in there, Fikri. Last night I dreamt mom come to that room in her praying veil. Don't. That room is dangerous, Fikri. Please, don't, Fikri. -No, all of this is actually... ...nothing. You..... Fine, go ahead. Look for yourself You won't find anything. I told you, there's nothing. -Kids don't know how to lie, Ali. Don't talk about this polytheism stuff. There's nothing! Ali, what's wrong? Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Satan! Get out! -What's wrong with her? Itah, what's wrong with you? Lift her up. Oh, God, the greatest! Forgive me, God. Do you know what kind of possession this is? Monkey? Snake? Hey, I'm talking to you. You understand, right? You don't have to meddle around. What is the purpose of you coming here? Who are you? This is my sister, get out. Go away from here! Get out! That is to ward off humans. Stupid! -Insolent! Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Who are you? I'm Fikri. Why did you come over here and who sent you? There's an abundance of food over here. When did you arrive here? That is none of your business! Fine. If you won't tell me, I'll force you out. It hurts! It hurts! Don't torture me! -Answer. Wak Ipin is the one who sent me! I'm afraid. I don't want to stay here anymore. Let me out! Let me out! Call my master. Call my master! I promise I won't disturb your family again. I promise. I promise. Promise? -I promise. Promise? -Yes. I'm going to Wak Ipin's house. If not, Itah's body will bleed out. Don't. Don't, Ri. I entrust you to take care of everyone. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Sorry, Wak, for coming late at these hours. You're Sofian's son, aren't you? What do you want? I would like to seek your help. About what? I'll let you know later. I know. I won't tell anyone about that secret. I know. I know! Hey. Where do you think you're going? Adam's fallen asleep. I'm going to take him to his room. Ma! Mama! -Don't! Don't. Mama! Help, mama! Help! Please, don't hurt me. Let go. No, please don't hurt me. Hello, Shikin? -Help me, honey. Ali just went nuts. He grabbed Adam. And then..... Hello? What did you say? Louder, please. I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? -Hello? Hello? Oh, God! God! God, God. It's me, Pak Hassan. I've been following you, Fikri. You don't have to be stunned. I'll be explain later. What are you doing at this abandoned house? Abandoned house? You've been played. I already taught you about these kind of things, didn't I? Have you forgotten? Jinns, demons, satan,... ...they have nothing else to do except... ...mislead humans and you believed entirely what they said, why? Pak Hassan, my wife and child. Hey, wait a minute! You can't go back with these clothes. They have to be cleansed. Let me do it. If there's anything else, change. Stop it! Stop it! Is Itah okay? Can't you see? Let her sleep it off. This is Pak Hassan. I know. Go away! Honey, it's me. Fikri. Dad's back. Love. Ali grabbed Adam just now. Then he locked him up in your mother's room. Calm down. Take care of Adam and yourself for me, understand? Understand? Stupid human. When did you return? You blindly followed what I told you to do. You just don't know with whom you're speaking too. We know. You're the Jinn. Descendant of demons and satan. I don't believe you. Who are you? -I'm Hassan. Who did you go see just in a while ago? You're truly stupid. You're so damned. You intentionally sent me to Wak Ipin's house. What are you up to? Why ask me? Ask this brother of yours. He has many secrets. Why do you say that? I don't know what you're talking about, satan! What secret? Tell me! Did you know what happened at Wak Ipin's house? I almost died! I told you not to go, but you still went. You mule. Serves you right! If you hadn't returned home,... ...none of this would've happened to Itah. You're just troublesome, you know? You're the one who is troublesome! Itah is the one that has to put food on the table. Do you think by praying all day long... ...you'll receive sustenance? You think it'll fall on your lap? If you really loved this family, why did you leave us? There was a problem, so you ran away from this house. Itah was non-stop busy, and you know who had... ...to deal with the ghosts in this house? Who? Fikri never ran away. Your father left him with me to be taken care off. How dare you bud in, old man. Don't make up stories! I'll beat you up! Show some respect! Pak Hassan is like a father to me. I just followed what our late dad wanted. I just followed! Every night I got strangled by mom. You think I could take it? -Then why did you come back? I returned because myself, my wife and my child... ...were haunted by that thing, understand? Or maybe you actually came back to look at the land inheritance? You had financial problems, so you came back home. You want to look at our parents inheritance. You want to take it all for yourself? Hypocrite! You're the hypocrite. You are! You're the hypocrite! Don't, Ali! Can you both have patience? I told you guys, didn't I? Be patient! Don't fight! That's what it feeds on. Damn you, old man! Never interfere with my plans! You know what, Fikri? I just couldn't bear the torture anymore. Since I knew about it, that thing always came and... ...haunted me and warned me not to spill the secret. I want to ask you. Do you still remember Ramdan, Wak Ipin's son? Ramdan. Yes, I remember. During that time dad and I went to see Wak Ipin. He was there. Ramdan told our dad he usually accompanies his dad curing people. But the truth is, he put spells on people. Several years back I got a call. He called me to meet up. He was desperate to see me. But once I met him, he seemed very scared. Wak Ipin had passed down his jinn to Ramdan. The ghost haunted him because he wouldn't accept it. He also witnessed something. He saw with his own eyes his dad worshipping the ghost, Fik. I believe he felt guilty and responsible... ...because his dad did something to our mom. He felt guilty. That's what he told me. It's true. I was 15 at the time. The city hall wanted to confiscate our land. They brought in trucks and everything... ...to force us to leave that day. But my dad brought me along to the city hall office... ...to meet with your mom. Please help me, okay, Hamidah? My wife is badly sick at home. Where else can I go? Your mom said that 14 warnings had been issued,... ...but may dad was stubborn. He still wanted to put up a fight. At the same time, he asked for your mom's help. To help us in any way she can to save our land. But it's not that your mom didn't help at all. I saw your mom go in to discuss with the manager. She tried to plead may dad's case. My hands are tied. I'm not the one calling the shots, Wak Then do you want me to prostrate in front of you? Wak! Forgive me, God. Wak, don't be like this. Wak, get up! Wak! Security! Security! Wak. Wak. Help me out. -Get up, sir. Get up, sir. Don't touch me! You just wait! I begged in front of you, Hamidah. You shamed me in front of them. You! Please, leave. -Get your hands off me! Let's go. After we built a house under the suspension tower,... ...my mom passed away. Why did it come up to this, Mardiah? I failed to take care of you well. What kind of husband am I? I have lost everything,... ...but don't you worry, Mardiah. I'm not going to let this go easily. But what my father did,... ...was unacceptable. That night he worshipped the cupboard. It's true Fikri, Wak Ipin was the one who put a spell on our mom. He was the one who used black magic on her. Actually, on the night you came,... ...was the night he killed mom. I didn't do anything. I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me, Fikri. Suspension tower areas are usually the borders. It's their path. Those who practice the dark arts... ...intentionally find those kind of places to build homes. The path is to facilitate their wrongdoings. Doing voodoo. Then why a cupboard? A cupboard is where we keep our closest belongings. Our clothes. It's the same with jinns, satan and demons. They stick with us like our clothes. Slowly... ...it consumes our soul. Misleading us... ...until we are destroyed. Oh, God. Pak Hassan. Pak Hassan. Help, Pak Hassan. Help, Pak Hassan. I've exposed the secret. I've told everything. I'm afraid that I will pay for it too. Please, Pak Hassan. Help me. Never fear, Ali. Where is the cupboard? Let me take a look. Ali, where is Ramdan now? I don't know. He disappeared a long time ago. He didn't want the jinn, so he ran away. Ali, please don't keep anymore secrets. I really don't know. -Fikri! Fikri, Ali. It doesn't matter whether Ramdan is still alive or not. More importantly, I want to know, where is Wak Ipin now? Don't you know, Pak Hassan? Wak Ipin has already passed away. It's hard, Fikri. This is hard. What's hard, Pak Hassan? -Do you know... ...what we're dealing with, right now? With what? We're dealing with a masterless jinn. We're in a pickle. Fikri. Pak Hassan. Damn you, human! You've interfered with my plans! I'll destroy your family! Fikri, get me a glass of water. Adam? Do you need to use the bathroom? Come over here, Adam. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Itah? Are you okay? Adam? Are you okay? Mama. Look, behind you. Behind you, mama. Ma! Shikin! Shikin, open this door! Shikin! -Mama, where are you going? Shikin! Ali! Do you have the key to this room? Wait here, let me take a look. Shikin. Shikin! Ma! Shikin! Open this door, Shikin. Shikin. Ali, have you found the key or not? God the Greatest. It seems like she's trying to say something. Why don't you try and listen? I want to leave. It wants to leave, Pak Hassan. All right. Why are you letting me suffer, stupid! I have to leave before dawn. I am told that at first light,... ...this body will burn together with me. Forgive me, God. Fikri. Fikri. It usually becomes weak once it's wrapped with this cloth. It will leave itself. But this thing is weird. It's really bizarre. I believe it's intentionally trying to make us suffer. It's challenging us. Pak Hassan, it's already almost dawn. Let her rest for awhile. I have something to discuss with you two. I'm not sure whether you're ready or not... ...to listen to what I have to say, but I must say it. Because we are running out of time, Fikri, Ali. So what are we're going to do now, Pak Hassan? We have to head to Wak Ipin's grave. Why, Pak Hassan? Pray to God to forgive his sins. Forgive me, God. What do you mean, Pak Hassan? I disagree. We can't ask for forgiveness... ...for the person who caused the death of our mom? This isn't fair at all. What..... Ali. -Ali. What is wrong with you? This is Shikin's life that we're concerned about? I'm talking about love and care. About forgiveness, Ali. Both of them are the most potent cures... ...that can overcome any animosity. Those who are easy to forgive others,... ...are valued high in the eyes of God, Ali. Do I really have to go? Can't we do it at home? We just pray at home. God can still hear us. True, but is this where Wak Ipin is buried? Are you sure about this, Pak Hassan? Yes, I'm sure. I just ask you to trust me as well. You're siblings, aren't you? Flesh and blood is a powerful weapon. What's wrong with trying it? This is the last straw, right? Just don't delay. Remember. The union between the two, good and evil,... ...I gave you white and black glutinous rice,... ...and you asked me why. What's it for? Well, the time has come. Bring all those things to Wak Ipin's grave. Hold them in your hand. You remember the incantation, don't you? The discipline of it, right? But, Fikri,... ...there is one thing that you mustn't forget. Never doze off even for a second. If not, you shall lose. Did you hear what Pak Hassan told us, Ali? Yes, I heard. -Do you still remember the grave? I've went there once, but I can't quite remember. We'll find it once we get there. Yes, don't delay. Hurry. We don't want the thing inside that room act out again. Permission to leave, Pak Hassan. What actually happened to dad that night? Dad always accused and blamed me... ...of not taking care of you well, Fikri. That's why we kept arguing. I just couldn't stand to hear all of dad's comments. I just had enough that night. I went to my room and left him. Then I felt so guilty while I was in my room. I planned to say I'm sorry to dad. Then I saw that he wasn't outside of the room. I tried looking for him. Then I saw dad... ...was sitting against the mosque wall, not breathing. The doctor said... ...he had a heart attack but I didn't believe it. He was just wearing his usual sarong, wasn't he? How did you know that? Never doze off even for a second. If not, you shall lose. Forgive me, Fikri. Forgive me, Fikri. I won't just think about myself after this. Forgive me, Fikri. It's all right, Ali. This is all a test. A test. It's not real. Idah,... ...could you bring a piece of prayer veil over here. Sit here for awhile, okay, Adam? Sit over here. Here, Pak Hassan. Can you please put it over here. Put it over Shikin. I'm right here. Hello, Fikri. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too, Pak Hassan. You have to come back, now. -What is it, Pak Hassan? Come back! Come back now! It hasn't left yet, Pak Hassan? With Gods will,... ...the thing that possessed her is almost about to leave. It just wants you to be here too. Fikri. Ali? Help, Ali. Don't force it. Just let it move itself. Oh, God the greatest. It's heavy, Pak Hassan. -Just follow it. It's heavier if you go against it. Just follow it. It has somewhere to go. It definitely wants to take us somewhere. Pak Hassan. Go inside. Don't force or pull it. Let it walk by itself. Fikri, when I give the word to open the cupboard, open it. Open it! Oh, God, the Greatest. Oh, God, the Greatest! Oh, God, the Greatest. Mama! -Honey. Pak Hassan! Hey, honey. Come on, wake up, honey. Hei, look at poor Adam. Shikin. Shikin. Mama. -Shikin. Oh, God. Shikin. Mama! Shikin, I apologize for everything that happened. I'm sorry too. Little Adam. Come here. I apologize, all right? Hold on. I have a present for you. What? Are you serious? Thank you, Uncle Ali. -This is for you. Give Uncle Ali a hug. But remember. When it's time to study or pray,... ...handover the phone to your mom, okay? Did you hear what Uncle Ali told you? Fik, actually mother never strangled you. She was trying to release... ...the chokehold of the ghoul that was behind you, Fik. Mom asked me to tell you so you wouldn't feel confused. But I failed to do so. I failed to convey what mom asked me to tell you. That's why I noticed... ...your life was shrouded with all those questions... ...up until now. I'm sorry, Fik. Itah. You don't have to apologize. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Forgive all our sins for being ignorant... ...as we have been mislead by the ghoul... ...which has been rampant within ourselves... ...until we forgot and never visited... ...our parents graves and never prayed for them. Oh, God, please place them... ...among the faithful. Amen. For Mom &amp; Dad
