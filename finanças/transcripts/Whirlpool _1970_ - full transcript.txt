(♪ Eerie flute playing) Too many whiskeys last night, darling? Or perhaps my cigarettes. You have to get used to them. The second time is always better. No, thanks. There won't be a second time. I'm packing my bags and going back to London. This house is definitely not for me. It makes me uneasy. (Car engine revving) (Sarah) Don't forget to go to the village and do the shopping. I'm afraid I'll be late for my appointment. And see you get everything that's on that list. We haven't enough food to last for the weekend. - How long will you be? - I don't know. It depends on the work, but I'll be in town all day. - Hope all goes well. - Thanks, Theo. - Please, don't let the boiler go out. - Okay. (Camera clicks) Another one. Good morning, Eric. Hello, Sarah. A little more to the right. (Sarah) Sorry I'm late. The traffic was absolutely appalling this morning. - Hold it. - (Camera clicks) - How's Theo? - Fine. - What's he doing now, then? - Oh, he's down at the cottage, doing the usual thing with the camera. - You know what he is. - Kinky as ever, I suppose. - Well, you know, he's very sensitive. - And what are you doing these days? Oh, well, lots of work, a little bit of play. You know, like I usually do. (Eric) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, I'm sorry. Sarah, this is Tulia. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. Tulia's just a beginner. Perhaps Theo would like to take some pictures of her sometime. I'm sure he'd be delighted to. Theo is Sarah's nephew. A nice chap and a great artist. (♪ Flute echoing) It's very nice of you to invite me to your home, Sarah. - I love the country. - Me too. Theo and I live in a lovely spot, right off the beaten track. - Is it very much further? - No, not far, about 20 miles. Eric said Theo is your nephew. Well, not exactly. He's a boy without friends or family. And I gave him a home. Theo is delicate and intelligent. He's a strange boy. Ideal for a person like me who likes to live in solitude. I don't think I could stand anyone else. He wants to become a photographer? He is a photographer, a very good one and most artistic. All my best pictures have been taken by Theo. - It's a lovely house. - Yes, it's a lovely spot. And nobody ever bothers us here. Hello, Theo. I've brought a guest. - Tulia, this is Theo. - Hello. I hope you'll be comfortable in the small guest room. You'll see the house is not really large. Nothing pretentious. We have lovely woods all around. We're completely isolated. No cars or city noises. Come along. We'll just go through here. Please sit down. - The house is like an icebox. - I've just lit the boiler. Which means, I suppose, you let it out. More or less. (♪ Gentle piano music) Theo passes most of his time vagabonding in the woods. I'm afraid I spoil him. Whiskey? - Water? - Yes, please. He's obsessed by photography. He's a bit of a bore at times. - Has anyone phoned? - No. At least, not while I was here. - Did you go to the village? - Yes. I put everything in the fridge. Oh, what beautiful photos. - Did Theo take them? - Yes, some of them. This one's great. (Sarah) That's one of Theo's. Who's this? Ah, that's Rhonda. Rhonda is a young Irish girl who lived with us for a time. - (Tulia) Very beautiful. - Divine, isn't she? - Fabulous. - I personally prefer Aunt Sarah. Much more photogenic. Eric's right. - Theo's a fantastic photographer. - Tulia is just a beginner. I met her at Eric's studio this morning. I thought you could take some good pictures of her for her composite, just like you did, you know, for Rhonda. Tulia's staying with us for the weekend. You wanted a fascinating subject to photograph. Well, I'm offering you this beautiful vision. So make the most of it. (Tulia) Is this your studio? (Theo) Yes. I wouldn't change it for the best studio in London. - (Theo) Good. Good. - (Camera clicks) (Bird hooting) Theo? Theo! (Bird hooting) - What's the matter? - I bumped into someone that was hiding. What do you mean? It was definitely someone hiding there. Are you sure you're not imagining things? No, Theo. I couldn't see who it was, but it was someone spying on us. (♪ Flute playing) Do you hear that? What is it, Theo? It's nothing. Forget it. Pass me your glass. Oops. You'll make me drunk. - And would that really bother you? - No, not really. And so? I just don't think I ought to. You sound as if you have reservations. Do you think I'm trying to corrupt you? You make me feel like the devil himself. Oh, no, please. It's just everything in this house is so strange. It makes me aware of things I wouldn't normally think about. I feel overpowered by you, Sarah. You know, I get the impression that all this has happened before. I feel as if I'm following in someone else's footsteps. - Whose footsteps? - Rhonda's. And for some unknown reason, whenever I think of her, shivers run down my spine. I think you're the kind who is inclined to be susceptible to atmospheres. Perhaps, although my suspicions aren't based on anything definite, but rather on intuition. I sense an evil atmosphere of darkness in which strange, fearful powers predominate, terrifying powers beyond all understanding which can twist and torture you. (Ticking) Brrrr! Ooh. The water in the lab is pure ice. I've got some great shots. We must celebrate this success. No, please, have one of mine. - What brand is it? - They're my special ones. May I have one? Do you like it? Mm-hm. Rhonda and I often used to go for long walks in the woods. The lake terrified her. I never could understand why she was so frightened. - She found it so sinister. - It is. Well, I didn't mean that exactly, but it's a place where reality and fantasy mix. It's the lake. It's like a dark mirror. - Full house. - Oh. I'm fed up with this. There's no excitement. - You win every round. - Well, that's the way it is. Quite frankly, I'm enjoying myself. Well, I'm not. Listen, I have an idea that might cheer up this funeral party. Pass me the cards. Now, it's quite simple, but this time the wager will be rather original. He who has the lowest hand must take off the article of clothing that the person holding the highest hand commands. (Sarah) Well, that's most original. - But it's ridiculous. - I think it's quite a good idea. Let's accept. Perhaps he will be the loser. And then we shall have a very interesting striptease. I'm the loser. And I'm the winner. Don't worry, my dear. I'll be discreet. (Whispers) Aunt Sarah, always ingenious. And now for round two. Well, well, well. It's not me who decides this time. I'm again the loser. Now I'm master of ceremonies. And if I command you to remove your skirt? I wouldn't do it. Oh, but that wouldn't be fair, my dear. One must enter the game with the consequences involved in it. What's more, it might be an interesting experience. I have an idea that beneath that rigid exterior there lurks a spirit yearning for a new sensation. Anyway, I'll let you off lightly this time. Come on, off with your jumper. Right, let's go. Ah! Really, Theo, you are a little pig. No consideration for your poor Aunt Sarah. Poor little me. Well, Tulia, it's our turn. Now, where shall we begin with Aunt Sarah? Go on, then. Command her to remove something. But, no, you're the winner. You have to decide. No, I'd prefer you to. Besides, I think your choice would be much more amusing. But, no, it's your decision. Now, come on, children. Or do I have to decide the order of my stripping? - The dress. - Okay. I'm the winner. So I'm the loser. What is it this time? Explain yourself more clearly, dear boy. What does your gesture imply? A woman's clothes from the waist down are various. Or didn't you know that, my darling? Perhaps you'd like me to take my shoes off. Not the shoes, Aunt Sarah. I'd prefer you to remove what you ordered Tulia to remove. Is that all? Mm-hm. There. - Hey, that's cheating. - It's not. You asked me to remove them and I did, didn't I? - Yes, but... - Ah, but the rules of the game do not state that I have to stand up to take my clothes off. Okay, let's play another round. (Whispers) - What did she say? - Nothing. Don't worry about it. Come on. What's the matter? Did I do something wrong? No. It's me that's wrong. Everything's just fine. It always happens like this. That's not playing fair, Theo. You get me all worked up and for what? It's nothing to do with you. The same thing happened with Rhonda. With Rhonda? What happened with Rhonda? It's nothing. Forget it. Why? What's all the mystery about her? This whole house is like a monument to her. Theo, what did happen to Rhonda? Why did she leave? (Thunderclap) (Gasps) (Gasps) (Manic laughter) (Screams) (Laughter fades) (Phone buzzes) (Secretary) 'Mr. Field? An inspector from Scotland Yard wishes to see you.' Alright, send him in. - Good morning. - Good morning, Inspector. - Please sit down. - Thank you. I'd like to ask you a few questions, Mr. Field, concerning this person, a young Irish girl by the name of Rhonda, Rhonda Clive. Does the name mean anything to you, Mr. Field? (Clears throat) Yes, of course it does, and you know it. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. (Inspector) Fine. That makes things easier. What precisely do you want to know, Inspector? Rhonda Clive has disappeared. I want you to tell me when you last saw her. Nothing's been seen of her in the past few weeks. Knowing your relationship with the person in question, I thought it was best to speak to you personally and privately. Last night, I was waiting for you both to come to my room. - Didn't Tulia want to? - No... It was my fault. I messed things up. I think we're rushing things a bit too much for Tulia. I don't think she's going to be as good as Rhonda. But, with a bit of coaxing, we might get a few kicks out of her. Wait until tonight. I think she's got the idea by now. Just leave her to me. I'll get her warmed up during the day. I promise you an extra special session for tonight, Auntie, dear. - Do you really think so? - Oh, I know so. She'll soon learn that a threesome can be even more exciting. She's a very sexy girl and no fool. Let me take care of things and she'll soon surpass your darling Rhonda. Tell me, Theo, did she come to collect her suitcases? Hmm? Who? Rhonda. Don't you remember? She said she'd come back for them. It's strange she hasn't returned. Were you shocked by last night's goings-on? I know I should've been, but I wasn't. You know, life is like a delicious ripe fruit. You have a limited time in which to eat it. You waste that time, you run the risk of never being able to finish it. And that would be a shame, believe me. One must get the utmost out of life without trying to understand the whys and wherefores of everything. Do you know what I think? I'm taking Rhonda's place. - And not very successfully. - What do you mean? It's true. I'm a woman and I understand other women. You refer to Aunt Sarah? Of course. She's in love with Rhonda. You formed a perfect trio, capable of getting everything out of life you wanted. And I'm the intruder, incapable of fitting in. Sometimes I think Rhonda's nothing but a ghost who haunts this house. What's all this? - I'm a photographer. - I didn't come here to be photographed. Everything here is photographable. At least, that's the way I see it. (Field) Your friend Patterson gave me your address. - Pat? - Yes. - He said I'd find her here. - Find who? Rhonda, the young Irish girl that you invited here to take photos of. I can't understand why Pat should say such a stupid thing. Well, that's what he said, and he seemed pretty sure of himself. That he knows me well, perhaps. But I have many photographer friends who have studios in London. Pat just happens to be one of them. But what's he got to do with it? Your friend Pat said she'd come here to have some composite photos taken, or whatever you people call it. Oh, yes? Well, well. And what else did dear Pat tell you, Mr., uh...? Never mind my name. Just tell me where she is. And you'd better tell me quick, for your own good. I'm not a policeman or the girl's father. I'm a friend of Rhonda's. No one has seen her for some time. She's disappeared. The girl who shares her flat has informed the police and a CID man called at my office the other morning. I suppose you find that amusing. But I don't. I'm a married man and have no wish for my relationship with Rhonda to be made public. Do you understand? A great many people would suffer for it. Now, tell me where she is. If she's not here, perhaps she told you where she was going. The same old story. The sugar daddy and his little friend. Listen, Rhonda spent just two days with me. Two. She then decided to return to London and catch the first plane to Italy where, according to her, she would find eternal sunshine. That's all. - To Italy? - That's what she said. Mind you, it's highly likely at this very moment she's lying in bed with a handsome Irishman. One thing is certain: she was pretty determined to get out of England for a spell. I accompanied her to the bus stop with her two suitcases. - I can't wait to start developing these. - I do hope they're going to be good. (Theo chuckles) It's from Aunt Sarah. She's popped down to the village. - I think I'll go and work in the darkroom. - Oh. Can I come with you? No. No one is allowed in my darkroom. Absolutely no one, not even Aunt Sarah. - Okay. - She won't be long. Help yourself to a drink in the meantime. (Door creaks) (Gasps) Theo? Theo? Tulia? Where are you? - Where's Tulia? - Don't know. I thought she was here. - What's wrong? What's the matter? - We thought you'd got lost. I must've fallen asleep. I'm sorry. Don't worry. No harm done. (Banging) Well? Now what's going on? - What's wrong with Theo? - He's just too sensitive. He can't even bear the sound of banging doors. (♪ Jukebox playing) - Milk for you? - Yes, please. - A bit more? - Yes, please. - Have you got something for me? - Yes, I have. But the price has gone up. Here. For twenty quid. Hey, that's a lot of bread. The cash. Here. The noise in this place is getting on my nerves. Come on, let's go. (♪ Flute playing) Who was that old man outside the pub? The village idiot. Why? Does he frighten you? No. It was the sound of the flute. It's the same sound that we heard in the woods. (Tires screech) Are you quite mad or just trying to kill us? But why on earth have we turned down this lane? Or rather footpath. Do you mind? Are you both raving mad? Theo, tell your gorilla friend to remove his filthy paws and leave me in peace! Ah, come on, Tulia. Don't be unsociable. Tom's a good lad. I do not appreciate the joke! Stop immediately! (Screams) Stop! Oh, please stop! - (Tulia) Stop! - (Tires screech) Bastards! Let go! Let me go! What, you really want me to? (Tom laughs) (Sobs) Hey! Hey, wait for me! Theo, wait! You can't do this to me! Don't leave me here! Oh, please! Please! Theo, please! Please, Theo! Now, now, poor little girl. Were you afraid? Wait and see what fantastic shots I've taken. To hell with your bloody photos! You too, you filthy swine! - Okay, okay. - You can keep your fantastic photos! - Drive me back to London immediately. - Hmm... Hold it. - Well, see you. - Yeah. In time, I think you and I will understand one another equally as well as Rhonda and I did. Theo, Rhonda and I spent many intimate hours in this house together. Intimate hours? Like those of last night, I imagine. Mm-hm. - Did you enjoy it? - Me, yes But I don't know whether Theo did. Oh, he did. Theo is a little Peeping Tom. He enjoys these situations. It's the only thing that makes him get excited. I don't know, though. I got the impression it was my fault. He's a very sensitive boy and I hope I didn't upset him. In the art of lovemaking, Theo is not exactly a Don Juan. It wasn't your fault. You're a really wonderful girl. I'm sure that between the two of us we can make something of it, and then the three of us will really be able to enjoy ourselves. Enjoyment without reservations of any kind. (Sarah) Put that camera down and come here. Oh, damn you! Oh, you are an imbecile. You drive me mad with all that paraphernalia. Don't you want to come and share the fun? You impudent little fool. I said, come here. I think you're absolutely super. I think you're pretty fabulous too. Come on, Theo. (Moaning) (Metal bucket clatters) What's the matter now? Come here. Theo! Where on earth are you going? Don't leave us like that. Idiot! (Bird hooting) Do you know what happens to curious little girls who play with fire? The proverb says that they burn their fingers, Tulia, dear. (Tuts) Naughty little girl, taking advantage of my carelessness to stick your pretty little nose into my affairs. But this time I shall be quite sad. Ah, yes, Tulia. Indeed, very sad. Very much more so than last time. And I was very fond of Rhonda. But with you, well, it's different. But why did you do it, Theo? Why? No, you'd never understand, my love. One must be blessed with a special kind of awareness to relish in suffering. No, no, you'd never understand my explanation. (Flicks knife) I'm sorry I have to do this to you, Tulia, but I have no choice now. Oh! (Gasps) No, no, please! I swear I won't tell anyone. I promise, not a word. Not a word to anyone, ever? Give me a kiss, a real kiss, like you know how to when you want to, like you kissed Aunt Sarah. No, no, much more passionate.
