- So long, good people! - Master, don't leave us like this! In the box! Good riddance! IANCU JIANU, THE OUTLAW - Master, leave our dead alone... - Please, master, have mercy! We'll go, all of us, to build up the dam! Don't take our cemetery! Don't ruin our faith, master! Master, the villagers have risen! They're gathering weapons and coming Call the guards! Follow me!!! And when brother oak, here, will have grown into a noble tree, may its leaves speak to the wind and the wind take all around the earth your reputation of brave man, now and forever! When the first snow comes, I'll dress up my wolf's coat. I say its' better we find shelter somewhere, for the winter... - Captain, release me! I want to leave! - What's up, you've got the shakes? Let me go! One more word out of you and I'll beat you senseless! We have to catch Jianu, no matter what! - When the night comes, death comes. - True. You go to sleep in your bed, at night, and if Jianu Finds you, by morning light you're broke. And he's a nobleman, a Jian... Who'd have thought him to be like that!? To join the rebels of Vladimirescu! I didn't call you here to listen to your moaning! Better you gather up some dough, so we can tighten the crew. Come on! - Get the money in sight, noblemen! - As you wish, great ban. Greetings! You've been living well since we've seen each other last! Chief Ianache, keep your hands to yourself! I wish I'd have dropped you in the baptismal fond, scoundrel, and I wouldn't have seen a nobleman's son becoming a brigand. Well, godfather... if one only knew what's to come... Master, be blessed! Oh, Lord, what a load of gold! Hold this. Come on, don't be shy! Help yourself! You too! Godfather, I bid you Farewell! And you'd better go on with your talk Instead of trying to follow me! I've got some pretty jumpy boys outside! As soon as they see a nobleman's beard, they tend to shoot! God help us! You'd deserve a throat cut, you scumbag, not a release! He's hexed, master! Bullets don't touch him. Like he's the devil's brother! You can become the devil's brother too, as long as you deliver him to me! How could I deliver, master? I've got no horses, no men, no money... I'll give you money. You buy horses, hire men, place soldiers all around Oltenia, if you must, but remember: His head or yours! Have you heard from Iancu? He's in great danger, Stefan! Turn the bag over, maybe you'll find something for silent friend. I'd turn it right now, but it's empty, what can I do?! We're eating dust, for now... Iancu, what if we were to release the men, for the winter? We're not breaking the crew. A winter spent at home will wear a man down. - What about the horses? They'll freeze. - We'll take them to Ionica. Woodruff, woodruff Listen, woodruff, Come under the moon, And gather up soon. You ride at wind's pace And find Iancu's place Bid him farewell And wish him be well As he rides away Apart from harm's way. Keep him strong and brave Make sure he's safe. And bring him to me Close enough to see, That I miss him so. Iancu, my Iancu, Iancu Jianu. - Did you hear it? - I did. - How do you come up with these verses? - You spoiled my incantation. They say if you spoil it, it will turn against you... - What was that? - Don't laugh, in Fidel. Don't you have a God? - What do I need God, if I've got you? Seven mountains I've crossed for you... At least if Old Stefan could have told me... Stop thinking about it! When death comes for you, it'll take you no matter where you are! You laugh, you fool! But I jump out of my sleep at night when I see you hanging by a tree! After that, I can't sleep for hours! - You've had enough? - A king's meal, Ioana. - Let me show you something, then! - I know! You've found me a horse! I've got you a beautiful horse, but this is something else! Come on! What the hell is this? When they're about to breed, I lock up the little ones, and I remove the parents... - You let the offspring die? - No. The legend says that hedgehogs will seek for the "Grass of the beast". This grass will take down the lock and they'll release their offspring. I watch them, and as soon as they take down the lock, I spot the grass and I'll - To wear it... - Not to wear it! You cut your finger and put the grass under the skin. It'll heal quickly! From then on you'll be hexed. Whoever has the power given by the Grass of the Beast... ls kept away from bullets and sword. May I be kept away from anything except your eyes! Iancu, my heart is aching and you feel like playing around! Just like the devil's offspring. Iancu, I hope there will be a time when we'll find our peace, because I've became scared of my own shadow. - Who knows, Ioana? - Day and night I stand in fear. I think about you, poured by rain, burned by the sun, haunted by guards... It's bad, Iancu, girls my age are all settled down. - Awesome whitey, Ioana. - Call him that, Iancu! Be good, old fella! Time for you to rest now! You've had enough. Be safe, Ioana. I'm glad you found Whitey for me! Farewell, Iancu! I'll wait for you! You didn't want to release me, and now I die like a fool! I'm never going to forgive you! Not even in the netherworld! Jianu, give yourself up! Throw away the guns! The other one too! Ride on! Let's catch him alive! Where did you leave him, Whitey? Take me to him, Whitey! - Tincuta... - Enough, be still! - Let me see! I'll bring you some food. - O! Where am I? At the Negomiru monastery. Luta The Gypsy found you. You were delirious for nights and days. Great fever. - Anyone else knows I'm here? - Corcodel. Let's see, are you still burning? Tincuta, will you ever forgive me for the harm I've caused you? I've forgiven you, Iancu. What's done is done. And, please, let's not talk about this anymore! I have to leave. Heaven won't allow me to stay here another night! Yes it will! I'll lock you up! You're not living here 'til you recover! - Corcodel! - Right here! Go quickly to the kitchen and see if you can find some food! Bless me, mother superior! The shepherds have brought 50 cheese barrels from our sheep yard in Sohodol. - What's the order? - What were you saying, Fevronia? Shut up, will you?! Hold here half of it, for our needs. Just let me taste a piece... - Slowly, don't fight! - You do it like this... Take them to the market! Ty to get a good price. Tell mistress Tincuta I'd like to have lunch together. - How long has he been here? - Who? Why are you hiding from me, Tincuta? I was afraid you were going to chase him away, auntie! What, you thought I was going to jump with joy that the madman has remembered you? - He's wounded, auntie! - Who made him start a gang? - I'm not defending him, but... Where is your pride, girl? He's left you at the altar, the laugh of the village. You, daughter of a Calafeteanu... And you want to defend him? What would you have me do, auntie? You know I've tried to Forget him. That's why I'm here. If I were you, I wouldn't fall that low to become Jianu's servant. I tell you this: as soon as he recovers. He should be on his way, and you on yours! Gold, help me overcome this! Help me Find the peace and the serenity From be Fore, and, as a sign of gratitude, I shall light up candles in three churches! I shall also give to the monastery a book of the Gospel, tied with silver hinges. How dare you ride into the Monastery? Forgive us, Mother Superior, but orders are orders. We're looking for the brigand Jianu! The holy ground is no shelter for thieves! Get out, pagan! I shall complain to Master Andronache! Go to king Caragea and complain, just scram! Now! And tell you master to lash you 25 times, before it'd cross your mind again to spy the Monastery grounds! How could I thank you that you've saved him, auntie? Don't thank me! It was my Cristian duty. I would have done the same for the most miserable Gypsy slave. Auntie... Look who's here! Long time no see! Your humble servant, Mother Superior. And good to see you! Be welcome! Still on the road, High Marshall? No way around it, Mother Glafira, as the troubles lead us. You'll stay over night, of course! With your blessing. Some good sleep wouldn't hurt us! For you, there'll always be a warm bed in here, High Marshall! Good to see you, Luta. - You've been travelling far? - To the great ban, with a complaint. - Complaint of yours? - Not mine, some peasants' from my land. I can't convince the great ban of my righteousness, but I'll get there! Or go over his head, to the king's court! Call the servants to take care of horses, and get ready For dinner! - How are things around here? - As you know, Marshall. The sisters work and pray... I'm carrying my age... It would be all good, if Tincuta wouldn't give us headaches. - I thought she was a good kid. - Good kid, but unlucky. Just when I thought she was over her troubles, that little scoundrel of the Jians has found his way over. Iancu, here? - He's here? - Yes. Tell me, does anybody know that I'm supposed to meet master Samurcas here? Marshall, what are you saying?! - He's been here since morning. - Did any one see him coming, because I know I was followed. - Leave it to me, I'll take care of it! He came through the secret entrance, that only I know about. Come, get in! Only by force we shall see justice done here! From the skin of the traitor boyars I shall make laces for my peasants' shoes! - You have to stay friends with them! - With whom? The snakes that have sold the country to the Turks? Never! Have you forgotten the Turks are onto you? I'm ready to join Ipsilante, the Greek, but to succeed we have to start together. I like this, Tudor. Only with the Greeks we can shake this Turkish burden. I'm not against it, but... Sister Iftodia, what saint are we celebrating today? Saint Minodora, mother. And you aren't going to sound the bells in her honor? Will do. What came over you to make you leave here? No house, no food... And that madman Spiru chasing you! Here you're secured and cared for. And the little lady's eyes are shining when she sees you! Can't beat good food and shelter, and a good woman... If I was to decide...! He's here. Be still... Good to find you here, cutie! - Master Tudor! - How are you, lucky bastard? How am I? Like crap! Come on! Corcodele! Corcodel! Run and bring a jug of wine! - You back already? - Coming! Which is which... - They've already built my scaffold! - Whatever Fate awaits me... Here and there, everywhere. What can I do now? There's plenty, but it's not the right time yet. I know what's on you mind, Master, but mere hoping is not going to solve anything. - We have to rise the people, Iancu! We're wasting time, master Tudor! You make one move, they make a hundred. Who's going to miss people like us? Even so, Iancu, at least we've kept our name clean. And what's in it For us, master Tudor? The Turks shall still lead us through their Greek emissaries, our peasants are still poor. We'll die in vain. You may be true, but it's our duty to try, Iancu! A people that isn't Fighting for its justice is not worth living. - You know anything about my men? - What? Where are my men? I don't know. - I beg your forgiveness! - Where are my boys? - I don't know. - Why did they leave you behind? To see if I find out about you and notify Spiru. Whoever shall deliver Iancu Jianu to the authorities, dead or alive, will be rewarded a thousand gold coins. I've heard some police talking. Let Iancu know that Spiru is leading three posses that are supposed to join forces. He wants to nail him at Wolf's Peak. ...deliver Iancu Jianu to the authorities, dead or alive...! Did you find out anything? Mistress Dobrita gave me this jug. She says it's yellow, like the one you like. She hasn't heard anything of my boys? If I could only see through stones, see where my crew is resting now... You'll find them. Who knows if they're not dead and buried by now! They know how to hide, and I know Spiru hasn't had time to search that much. I say it's best if you shall hide at my place For now, until things start to cool down. - Do you think I can wait now? I have to track down my men. You go home Iancu, don't go! Ionica, are you deaf? Do you understand my words? What I have to do is no woman's work! Iancu... run before they catch you! Spiru has destroyed us... Some of us dead, some beaten almost to death... - Have you seen my boys? - I haven't... But I heard he's onto them. For three days now they keep them hanging On Take them down! - Bury them properly! - Be blessed, Iancu! - Take as much as you need! - Thank you! Give the money back, my girl! This money is cursed! - They can only bring us troubles! - What are you saying, uncle? I'm saying what's right, my good boy, that as long as you'll be away, we'll have to deal with the noblemen ourselves! You talk like a coward, uncle! If none of you would run From them, they wouldn't ride you like this! We've tried to fight them at the cemetery, and look what we've got! I say leave us alone and see to your life. You know, old man, you deserve your Fate... for it's been easier to bend than to stand up for yourself! That may well be, but you're not so good at chasing them away either, because you rather make them mad and turn them against us! Give him the money, Ilinca, my girl. What comes easy, goes easy! - Don't go! - Wicked woman! We can't seem to understand each other. Do you understand I need my men? You want me to leave them alone? They'll kill you. It's you they want, can't you see that? It's your head they're after. And on Wolf's Peak only the eagles reach. What did you say?! They are on the Wolf's Peak... You knew all along... If you got to lie to me, then you know we can't live together. Follow Jianu! Ride! Bring more straw! Titi of the Ghituleasa clan, guilty of robbery... dirty escaped convict... ...has found an ally in that cursed Jianu. In order to set an example for the disobedient... is sentenced to death by hanging! - Are you happy with the verdict, thief? - I'm happy, why complain? - For it could have been worse. - What do you mean, worse? Worse, because on that chair there could have sat Jianu, And you highness could have been here, in my place. Get out! "I've been born here in Olt, Here in the Craiovan Clan..." - Good day, master. - What is it, Ionica? I wanted to let you know your mare has given birth. Two foals. Two? That's sign of wealth. Is that all you came to tell me all the way here? It's also the documents of property. We haven't signed them in years. Make sure you stop by the office. - Your highness... - What is it now? - You know... Your highness! - Tell me! - I've brought you a gift. - Beautiful horse! - What do you want from me? - I've got a problem. - Go ahead. - Only your highness can help me. For you are brave and powerful... But I'm shy to ask this. - Tell me, then! - Pardon Iancu Jianu! - He sent you? - No, your highness! And he mustn't find out, because he'll pretend not to know me anymore. Your highness doesn't know him, but he's not a bad man, He's just like the wolf among the dogs. He bites, has no other choice. - I vouch for him. Can he be pardoned? - Do you know what you're asking, girl? Should you forgive him, he'd be a regular guy, a married man, he'd settle down and mind his business. - All right girl, go now! - Will you Forgive him? Go in peace, Ionica, and take care of those foals. Be blessed, your highness, for you are indeed good-hearted! Bring that Jianu scoundrel back! Duti, Duti, you've left too, huh? Will you ever Forgive me For tricking you with that belt, that you thought was encrusted with gold, and it was pure brass. - Better give me some tobacco! - Attention! - Who's' there? - Look, old man! Keep it like this, and you'll have to forget about that ram of yours! You should say thanks if you're left even with the horns. Get closer! Tomorrow at dawn we hit the posse! Burn their camp! No forgiveness! - Iancule, only a few of us are left. - Doesn't matter! - There's others, too? - What others? If it's Duti of Mosanu, I'll give him his money back for that belt. I won't tell him it's brass, though! Damn, this looks like Tite! - Looks doesn't mean anything! - It's not Tite, that's for sure. What, are you stupid? Or blind? - What are you doing here? - What do you mean? I came too. - How'd you Find us? - They told me. - Who's they? - Andronache the ban. - You wouldn't be a spy? - I swear I'm not! The ban called me to his ranch and gave me my pardon. I can't believe it. What, just like that? There'll be more pardoned by the day of Saint Mary. - Tite, if you sold me, I'll kill you! - You kill me, you'll be sorry. - I didn't sell you. - So be it. So let him go, and they'll seize all of us instantly. - You really think you'll be Forgiven? - Didn't you hear him? We've till St. Mary's Day, not a day after... Tite, you're a lying sack of crap! I might have lied some other time, but not now. - What do you think, Codin? - Don't know. I'm thinking. At least if this wasn't just some rumor, so they could catch us. Once they catch us, they know what to do. I'm thinking of my folks. I've left them with all the hard work. - I'd go home! - I would too. I'd marry Rodica. Unless she's already taken... What got into all of you? You want to go? - I think I'm leaving. - Over my dead body. No use getting angry, captain. I said I'm leaving, I'm leaving. - Spiru forgives me and you kill me! - Captain, release me too! - I'm leaving too. - Release me too. - I want to go too. - I think I should go too. - Captain, I miss home. - Don't be too harsh with them, Iancu. You believe that? All of you have the minds of slaves! For as much as a little rest, like you'd ever be allowed to have it, you're all ready to sell your faith! You want to kiss the ban's boots! Go ahead. You're all free! Whoever's still a man better know I'll be waiting for him at the St. Mary's Fair, in Caracal. Iancu, my thoughts have brought you here. Try and get some rest. I see you're worried. You didn't find your men? - I wish I didn't. - The posse got them? - Worse. They want to plead forgiveness from the ban. - He'll forgive them too? - What do you mean, "them too"? He promised me he'll only forgive you... - Who promised you? - Ban Andronache. I gave him my best horse as a gift and he promised to forgive you. So you gave him that idea. What, instead of being happy that you don't have to run any longer... Do you understand, you crazy girl, that you've helped him divide us? What Spiru couldn't do, with all his posses, you've done with your madness? What did I do?! What?! If you were to carry water in your hands, all the way to Novac's valley you still wouldn't make up for the harm you've caused! Sir, didn't you happen to see some little people around? I didn't. What are you doing in these parts? I live close by. My Father's a ranger. - What's your name? - Radita. - What's yours? - Iancu. I want to talk to those little people, tell them not to be upset with me. - Why are they upset? - I beat Matei up. - He's one of them? - No, he's my cat. What did he do? I caught him eating some birds. And mommy told me it's because of him the little people got mad at me And hid in the forest. Jianu! You're surrounded, Iancu! Give yourself up! Are you Iancu Jianu? You're kidding. He's just a story! Radito, be good and go home now, all right? I will look for your little people and tell them to forgive you. And tell them that Matei is a very, very mean cat. I won't! Go now! Speak, Jianu! Hit him! He'll tell us everything, bit by bit! Untie him! - Jianu, I'm ready to forgive you. - Kneel before his highness! Leave him! Me, Caradja Voda. King of Vallachia, I shall have the mercy to pardon Iancu Jianu's doings, and free is he to go anywhere, unbothered by me or my army. I would only like to know what are Vladimirescu's plans against me. Master Tudor? He's so caught up in work, he barely has time for himself. Jianu, I don't have patience for this! I have news that Vladimirescu is setting up a riot. - Is that true? - Small talk, your highness. Nobody can ever shut the people up. - I'll shut you up! Hang him! Forgive me, but there's no other way. Tincuta, remember I only taught you well. I wish I was wrong, but...! So, remember: anytime you're in trouble, my door is always open. I hear that just the other day the wolves got into Vasi's, the ranger's house They only left his clothes. They hunt in packs, up and down the hill. They smell the man from far, and one doesn't Feel them coming. - Put the box on the sleigh and shut up! - I'm shut. Up. But you should think of yourself, my lady. I can still try some witchcraft. - I bet I can... - Luta, I said shut up! - Go to the sleigh! - When the blood is boiling...! - Did you bring axes? - I didn't. - Forks? - No. - Guns, swords? - Why, are we going to war? Listen, when you talk to me, you shut up! And do as I say! It's your damn master that's going to get us all killed! - I'm the only one that can save him. - You're saving him and sink yourself! Whatever's written, auntie! Have mercy, your highness! Mercy for Iancu Jianu! - Your highness... - What? Lady Ralu wishes to speak. Have you been looking for me, my daughter? To bring you mistress Tincuta Calafeteanu, that kneels before you. You're related to my old emissary in Manati. His daughter, your highness! Good and faithful men. If I could help with anything, don't hesitate to tell me. I thank your highness For your good will. - I'm listening. My Fate depends upon your highness. Please help me, and I shall pray for you always. Give me Iancu Jianu, your highness! What's this?! Even in my home people dare to defy me?! - Dad, this is the law of the land... - Law of the land? What law? I'm the law here. - What is it, my lady? - Not good, your highness. The neighborhoods are rioting. People are coming over. You hear them? Boyars of the country, boyars of the country, Hear the Caradia king's law... What do they want? To come here and ask forgiveness for Iancu Jianu. You think I would give in to the masses? Humble myself? I shall call the guards to shoot them! I hear that the daughter of Calafeteanu has claimed him! Again with the law of the land? No other way, your highness! They're singing him praises and songs! It's a riot that's about to grow! Better to end this now, while we can. Have you all gone mad? Is the scaffold ready? - Ready, your highness. - Call the priest! - Repent, son. - I am ready, Father. You're off, Iancu! Please, don't say anything! But if the priest weds us here, you're off the hook! Don't question anything. It's better that way. - I never thought you'd forgive me. - Shut up! Please, God, allow the holy ritual of these two people joining their lives. Be merciful and forgive them their trespasses. God's humble servant, Iancu weds God's humble servant Catinca... In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Be faithful to one another. We promise to be faithful to one another. We promise to be faithful to one another. We promise to always choose the rightful path. And follow our earthly masters. We promise to always choose the rightful path. And follow our earthly masters. We promise to always choose the rightful path. And follow our earthly masters. And watch out so our soul shall never fall into the temptation of the unfaithful! And watch out so our soul shall never fall into the temptation of the unfaithful! Now, son, give her the wedding kiss. - Thank you, master. - Thank you, master. You here?! - Be welcome! - Good to see you! - Long live, master! - What's with you? Winter is here now. Yes, a little early... Sit down! Welcome, master! - What are you all doing here? - We've been cutting wood, master. - Are you finished? - We are. - Cheers! - To your health, master! Cheers! - Say, Ciolpanete, how's your old man? - He's gone, master. All of us will go. Yes, but some go more content than others, for this world hasn't shown them unhappiness. Me, for one, are already broke, and winter hasn't even started. That's because you eat too much! Try cutting the breakfast, skipping the lunch and drinking some water instead of dining! You'll see how this works out! Mistress Tincuta is not going to let us starve... She's a good servant of God. She won't... She hasn't given up on us yet... But, after the taxes, you're left with almost nothing to survive. Shut up, will you?! You're crying like a bunch of women. Don't get upset, master, they speak out of sorrow... Oh, mother, this dress is like candy on you... Beautiful! - Is the meat ready? - Almost. Did they bring anything from the pond? They didn't have time to break the ice. Did our master sleep away tonight too? Don't get funny with me! I won't, but I keep hearing the master takes his horse rather often to the stable up on the hill. Get out of here, nasty woman! Say more of it, I'll have you lashed! Get out! - Who's there? - Me, Mandache. Kiss your hands, mistress. You called for me. Yes. What did you do with the concession of the Feteasca ranch? Kir Margulis says he can't pay for it as he agreed. And you believed him! You know Margulis is a liar! What could I do, I can't fight him there. If master Iancu would agree to bring him here, it would be something else. What else? For a while now, some of our men started running away from the property. - What's gotten into them? - I don't know! - Nobody tells me anything. - Did you try finding them? Yes, I've had men on their tale, but so far, nothing. - Could they be running to other ranches? - Not a chance, mistress. - Other ranchers are losing men too. - All right. You may go! Look who's here! Leave everything aside, and prepare the master's bed! - What do you mean, prepare it? - Do as I say! In vain I've raised you and taught you well... Luta! Our master is here. I was worried sick, all night. I was wondering what happened... You're frozen still, master. - Good morning. - Good morning. Why are you up so early? I followed your habit. I see it's a custom in this house. - You must be hungry. - I'm not. I'm dead tired, though. Go and rest! Iancu... You know what I've been thinking? Let's throw a party. - Have some people over. - What people? Like boyar Izvoranu and godfather Andronache? I shall not hear of them. Yes, but we're living among people and we have to get along. Get along with whom? With this creeps that were hunting me down to kill up until last year? Forgive them, Iancu. People aren't going to get better. Let's not live in the past. I'll never share my table with Caradja's slaves! I was thinking... We should stop living alone like this... Ever since we've moved here, nobody came to greet us. But if you say so... It's a full year today since we've wed. Good lord, please give some charity to a poor man... and I shall say blessing upon this house! - There you go! Tincuta, great meal! I know you father would be truly happy to see you mistress of your own land! - True, godson? - True, godfather. I raise my glass for your health! And I'm glad, godson Iancu, that you came to your senses and joined the real world. In the Scriptures they say the shepherd is made more happy by his lost and retrieved lamb than by all his flock all together! Long live, Iancu! I'm glad now that next time I see you, I won't fear for my life. A boyar is forever a boyar! Iancule, tell me, is it true what the Folk say... that you're hexed so nothing kills you, except For a silver plumb? - Let's go, sing!! - As you wish, mistress! - Who's there? - Good man. Iancu! Iancu... Still strong, uncle Mereanu! I've Found shelter here, next to the daughter of old man Varlan. But I hear you're doing very well! - Any word From the others? - Who knows, Iancu?! After the St. May's fair, at Caracal, they hunted us down like beasts And we've split all around the land. - Were they all there? - All of us. We've waited for you for three days. Listen, let's gather the men up. Be like be Fore. What's passed is passed, Iancu. We can bring those times back. Be together again. Strike hard. A few men can't strike hard. The whole people can! - Shall I open the gates? - All right. By lunch time I have to see Marshall Tudor. He heeds as many horses I could get him. - Is the riot starting? - Not long before that. Uncle Mereanu! Mistress Ionica told me to tell you... - Uncle Iancu! - Trica, you're all grown up... - Farewell, Iancu. And what's in it For us, master Tudor? The Turks shall still lead us, our peasants are still poor. We'll die in vain. You may be true, but it's our duty to try, Iancu! A people that isn't Fighting for its justice is not worth living.
