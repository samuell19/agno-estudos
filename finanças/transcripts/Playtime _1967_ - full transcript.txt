I packed your cigarettes, and your pajamas are on the bottom. Anything to declare? Open your purse. This is ridiculous. I can't believe it. Just a few words for our paper. Mr. President.

No, in there. This way, sir. What about the gentleman who's waiting? Come along, sir. Mr. Giffard just went by. - Excuse me, sir. - I'm very busy. Mr. Giffard, Düsseldorf is on the line.

This is our new electric broom with two headlights. It's a broom. That connects the two headlights. To turn it off... Notice the advantages of the adjustable head. Watch. Here we go. I'll be right with you. I'd like some information on your new door. Just give me one minute. Our motto: "Slam Your Doors in Golden Silence." Please sit down. Yes, this is the latest model. So your doors are totally silent? Absolutely. Let me explain. They're made of completely insulated material. Very interesting. Can I really close this door without making a sound? I'll demonstrate. This thick layer of Sonex guarantees total silence. That's why our motto is "Slam Your Doors in Golden Silence." But this one's wood, isn't it? It looks like it, but it isn't wood at all. Try it. - Even with an umbrella? Not the slightest sound. Here are our prices and various reference numbers. At your service, sir. I'm very pleased with how everything's organized. Good morning, sir. I had a little problem. A man came by with a pipe and a long scarf. He sat at the desk and went through all our papers, you see? As if it were the most natural thing on earth! This way, please. That's him! He's everywhere! Look for our colleague. Allow me to help you. Make yourself at home. Sit down. Do you smoke? Would you like to look through our files again? Don't be shy! Go ahead! I'm the CEO of this organization. We were the first to study silence. That's progress! Ah, a salesman! Excuse me, sir, but my lamp is broken. It's the plug. Could you take a look? We'll wait in the booth. Sir, come this way. Tell me, is this your pipe? This isn't him. Sir, I'm so sorry. I like operetta, and I asked my cousin to join me. Is it working now? What was wrong with it? I'm so happy. Thank you so much. Do I owe you anything? You're very kind. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. The New Moon booth? - May I help you? - New Moon. This way, ma'am. My dear sir, you forgot your coat. Allow me to help you. Please forgive me. Let me count. Someone's calling you. Hey, Hulot! From the army! Attention! We did the Eiffel Tower. Stay together. We're leaving. I'm confirming Mexico for Saturday. Flight 612, 2:30p.m. Sir, we're closing now. Thanks again. I'll be back. It's nothing. For your rugs and carpets, there's just one product... Excuse me, sir, but... Hulot! Don't you recognize me? Schneider, from the army! I'll just be a minute. Wait for me here. What traffic! Like they say, "Time is money." It's the deluxe model. Got it two days ago — cash! The parking meter is my garage. You got any change? I only have big bills. Let me find one franc. Here we go. There. That does it. Come see my place. I bought an apartment in this ultramodern building. Come in for a minute. Have a drink. Come on. Have a little scotch. What happened to you? What happened, my friend? Let me see. I bumped into something. Come have a quick drink. You'll see. Right into the door — bam! I'm taking my vacation in June this year. Hulot, it's been a real pleasure. Bye now. You don't understand. I waited for you. Where? At the Quick Snack. I was there at 6:00. What do you think of the "Last Look"? What are you doing there? Other side. The red button. It's automatic. It's written below in English. "Push." There you go. See? One last scotch? A quickie? You sure? You're always welcome. Bye now.

No, I couldn't possibly. Georges, could you announce that Group E is arriving? This is Group E. Follow this young lady. Last call for Economic Airline's evening tour. Ladies, A to L are going to Montmartre... and M to Z to Montparnasse. Pardon me, but aren't you Mr. Hulot? I looked for you for two hours this morning. Look here. You were in our company's building. Okay, boys, snap to it. Let's get to work. Those things go in the back. You'll get lost in there. Watch out. You're on the transformer. The Royal Garden. One moment. Yes, we're opening tonight. Yes, very exclusive. Table for two? What's the name? Is the sign connected? Does it work? Turn it on! Go on! It'll be very classy. I'll surround the band with spotlights. Those are customers. Gentlemen, get all your tools out of here! You were supposed to be done painting. Get out! - That's enough. - Just doing my job. Charming! Table six. Your shoe. Look after them, will you? Nice work on the decor! Looks great for our foreign guests! You're a specialist, right? Go out and fix that right away. You can't go out there like that. Can you go out there? Here's the superglue and the tile. You can't miss it. Right when you go out. Yes, very good. - Two Turbots à la Royale. - What is that exactly? One of our specialties, madame. It's poached in white wine, then bathed in a cream sauce. It's delicious. Let's have the wine list. Your table, sir. Two? That table is reserved, sir. Start changing reservations now and we're in trouble. Look at the sauce. Then turn it the other way. The other way? There. I see. Why is that? Then use the door. Instead of arguing, you might pack up your tools. Oh, great! - Your coat. - I'll keep it. Come along. Is this table to your liking, or would you prefer — Back in the kitchen. That's enough now. Go on. Table six. Are you crazy? Robert, you have restaurant training? - Yes, sir. Table six, quickly. What are you waiting for? Give them a menu. Look at that! That will do. Bring that here. Go on. Now it has to be seasoned. And now he's putting the sauce on top. We called in a reservation. We reserved this table. What's going on here? I phoned to reserve this table. I won't sit anywhere else. - What is it? - Just a short circuit. Fix it quickly. Keep on with your work. - No one's on the floor. - Someone has to start. Look at those marks. It's the chairs. Do something about it. Fix it. Take it to the kitchen. Move along. There's nothing to see. You see that? Let's have a look. Look at that. I can't see from back here. Am I supposed to be an acrobat? I need to see. I recommend the Turbot à la Royale. I don't much care for fish. Waiter, can't you handle this table? No. From there to there. Hurry up, gentlemen. That's a good one! This is for you, whenever you're ready. You're really gonna love it! My dear, I can't believe my eyes! What are you doing here? So good to see you. We have an excellent table. Come join us. Will this table do? Waiter! How "tourist." Pretty color, isn't it? You see her shoes? - So chic. - It's a flood of tourists. Where's the architect? There he is. - What is it? Look at this! Get waiters who know how to move around the tables. Doorman. Go get me more of this. - That's good stuff. I've taken it. Tea, please. Hulot! The army, remember? Come with me. I couldn't stop earlier in the street. - I haven't paid. - It's on me. I work at the Royal Garden nightclub. You'll be my guest. You're the architect. You can't just leave! Take care of the architect. No? Okay. Ah, you're the orchestra? Please show this gentleman the way. Sorry to bother you, sir... but we expected 50 people, and we've served 120. I don't know what to serve. There's no more sole, no filet mignon, no coq au vin. All I have is cold chicken. - Then serve that. Are you serving dinner? - We have only cold dinners. Waiter, remove the menu. What happened to you? - A Royal chair. - I'll serve for you. Could you take that table of American tourists? Sure, right away. Don't worry. But let's trade. No, that's not for this table. Take this away. Find the right table. I took care of the American women. If you need anything else, just let me know. Is the nightclub in here? Hulot! Come on in. - There's no butter. - Just one moment. You jacket's torn. Waiter. Look at this. Look what happened. Them and their iron chairs. Hulot, find the architect. No, that way. My friend! What's going on? What's going on here? You'll be my guest. It's my pleasure. That guy's in international finance. I was wrong. It's the other guy. No, I want you to take this back. It's cold! If it keeps up like this, we're finished. Architect. Can't you do something? We need air. It's the latest self-regulator. I can't serve this. - It's melted. - Of course. It's an oven in here. It's not my fault if it's not in French. The master... up there. The bar. It's working. What are you waiting for? Go ahead. Get all that out of here. Our great French chef. Find out what's causing it. The check. Come on, get a move on! Our guest of honor. I'm in a hurry. My champagne, and get me that ice. What's that? - Ice. Iced champagne. Don't just stand there. It's the same thing every night. And the party goes on! Music! Music! No, I don't play piano. My friend, what are you doing there? Nothing to do? Can't you see customers are waiting? Wake up. - Well done. - I suppose it's my fault? Hurry up. Can you help me out? My tie fell in the sauce. Mind lending me yours? This is getting to be — I'll give it back. We're all meeting at the Golden Corkscrew. That's very pretty. Really? I was a big singer... I had a big hit that went like this. You're fired. He's the new architect. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Napoleon, the emperor of French cuisine. Where is the rue Piccolo and the Golden Corkscrew? Rue Piccolo... I hope you had a nice evening. This is no time for business. It's on me. It's a party. Understand? Come on, have fun. Meet me for coffee at the drugstore. - I love Paris at this hour! - I do too. Hey, how about getting a little drink? Can't a guy have a little fun? One letter. No, to the right. No, keep going. That's good. Come take a look. - How you doing? - Fine, and you? Yep, it's broken down. Hi, Nenette. This is really too much. Madame, come now. French-style! Have a drink on me. Let's have some coffee. Ah, something's broken. Mr. American, climb up here and do my job if you want. Where's my espresso? Robert, bring your glass over here. Quick! Okay, that's enough. Beat it. Now, how long is this? I'm your impresario. I'll take you to New York. No, no more. A very modern musician. French-style, of course. I'm paying for everyone. Keep the change. Meet my pal Hulot. All fixed now. No need to panic. These are our latest sponges. Excuse me, sir. I'd like — What do you want? Your fancy goods, please? At the back of the store. - What does that mean? - I don't know. Can't they use French? Come on. That one. Could you wrap it? - Very well. - It's a surprise. - I'd like a sample, please. - This one? Yes, it's very pretty. Sir, that's not the exit. This is the exit. Please go around. Sir, could you please give this to the young lady getting on the bus? Carrots, shoes, a nice head of lettuce, leeks, and Camembert. Now see here, son. Hurry. Come on, kids. Get in, quick. Restored and Digitized by...
