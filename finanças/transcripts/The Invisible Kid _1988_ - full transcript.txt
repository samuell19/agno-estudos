But the Valleyville team, led by Donnie Xanders might have a chance at upsetting perennial champ Iron City. And that's all the news there is today in Valleyville, the toilet bowl capital of America, recently cited as the least desirable place to live in the entire United States. And now, some use. Thank you. Jaikovsky. Swan Lake. It's 8:15. Hurry up. We were talking about the basketball team. All anyone talks about is basketball. Is that all the people in Barleyville ever think about? Once again, Dad. Here we go. Isn't there anybody out there who's doing something interesting? What did you do? Please stop trying to be like your father. He never invented anything, and neither with you. You're both just dummies. Mom, you don't mean that. Mean what? Dummies. I didn't say that. Yes, you did. Mom, I said you just said, dummies. Well, I didn't mean it. You're going to be late. Dr. Theodore says that people are always late in this. The bus. I don't take the bus. I'm going to be late. Damn, I'm glad I found you. The stuff I gave you wasn't tetrabolic acid. It was detrinsiotic acid. And if you added trinsiotic to the mixture, it would have exploded. Thanks, Milton. You should give up, Grover. Milton. We're close. I can feel it. Feel white. You don't even know what your dad was trying to invent. If we keep following his notes, we'll find out the missing ingredient. Could be anything, Grover. Anything. And unless you find your dad's original formula, I'm not going to steal any more chemicals for you. Smell funny, man. Grow up, Scott. Angry young man getting plenty. Bullshit, Miss Cindy Moore. No shit. All the way. Geek Crossing. Watch for geek. You're in trouble, scumbag. I should have known. Follow me. Who brought day glow cockroaches to Parents Night? Not me. Oh. Milton McClane said it was your idea. Who filled the football with helium on Homecoming Day? Now, that was funny that you shut up, Carl. Opening kickoff. The ball left the field. Dr. Theodore says I shouldn't have to put up with it. Dr. Theodore? Channel 29 Advice for Life day and night. Excellent program. Oh, last month you quit the basketball team. I don't have time for that kind of thing anymore. Wasn't ain't good anyway. Quitters never win, son. Subject is attempting to assume his father's identity. He's just like his father. Mom, I'm about to complete Dad's work. Have you ever in your eyes or anything? What's going to work? I don't know exactly. He doesn't know. I can't find his completed formula. All I have are is notes. The last step missing, as you know. Didn't tell me what he invented because I wanted to be a surprise. It was revolutionary. Do you know what he was really trying to invent? A new toilet bowl cleaner. Leave that alone. Let me give you some advice, son. Believe me, I hate to be the one to burst your bubble. Your father was no great inventor. And I'm... I'm the one who had to go through his papers trying to find his grade reports. All I found was gibberish, drawer after drawer. Just ask yourself this. If he was such a genius, will he have spent his entire lifetime at Valleyville High teaching chemistry to misguided little sniths like cute? You take that stuff and you bury it and and go clean that room. But you must put poor Mr. Baxter through. Mom, when poor Mr. Baxter fired Dad, that is what causes heart attack. And that is when you started acting this way. Your father stopped teaching his classes. Mom, he was trying to get the invention ready for the science convention. When I started acting what way? You were just like your father called him up in the clouds with the angels and the airplane. Look at that junk. I'm probably going to sit there for the rest of my whole entire life. You're... You should call Dr. Theodore. I don't want to call Dr. Theodore. I know. I told that to Dr. Theodore right on TV and he said you were mixed up. And a million people heard him say it. So don't you try to hide it. Our notes don't drink that. Great invention, Dad. It's Friday. Take it easy. What if it's dangerous? Could be a very important discovery. Didn't hurt. Albert, Grover dead. You never looked better, you old scientist, you... - Grover. - No. Grover. Let me in, man. Look, if you're embarrassed about what happened in school today, it's all right. I mean, you can't hide from the world forever. So stop being the dweeb and let me in. Should wish Cindy Moore live next to me. Sloppy little dweeb. Oh, please, sir, don't eat me. I have a wife and three little pigs. Pickles. Yeah, right. 8 May. Sloppy little tweeb. Grover, what time is this? What? Quick, just tell me time. Eight. Dance is 30 minutes. It's just like Albert. - What? - 30 minutes. Just like Albert. Milton, we have cracked the missing link. Yeah, this stuff makes you disappear. We bust you. We're going to fulfill Dad's dream. We're going to Pittsburgh. National Convention of the association of Scientists. We can present his findings. Dad, a week from now, the whole world's going to know that you were the greatest scientists that ever lived. Can you imagine the possibilities of this stuff? This thousand? Well, if somebody got shot and you could make them invisible, the doctors could see where the bullet is. They're going to make Zits disappear. Your whole face can be a Zit. And you like, Jericho's going to be so red. Wait. There's one thing you got to remember, though. We have to keep this absolutely secret until after the convention. Somebody could steal. Okay by me. I mean, who wants to share anyway? Oh, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm the one who thought of the transonic acid. You've had your fun. Thank you. Okay. Maybe we should experiment with it a little before we make it public. Look for side effects and stuff. Damn right. We can't be too conscious of stuff. Let's get started. It's time for a fight for life with Dr. Theodore. Thank you. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. You know, most of our problems in life are not caused by ourselves. They are caused by others. Let's take our first caller, Advice for Life, you're on the air, Dr. Theodore. This is Deborah. Oh, Deborah, our favorite caller. Deborah, see you. Have we been making progress lately? How? Should we wear a coin? Hello? Hello. Advice for Life, you're still on the air. I just saw my mom. Just like you are me? Deborah, I think you need a therapist. How many of you ladies and gentlemen here believe that Deborah needs a therapist? And now, the exciting conclusion of Eyes of Fire. They vanished. They just disappeared. Damn it, Tony, it's a good movie. It's cold. Are you sure this stuff's going to last 30 minutes? It did last time. Well, if it doesn't, it's going to be plenty hot on the way home. Isn't this sweet? Tony? I said stop it. Cindy, we have been going out for two weeks, you know. How about if I score 20 points? Will you? Yeah, Tony, you always score 20 points. Why don't you just worry about winning? You're on a team, you know. How about if I win the Sharpshooter award? What are you doing? What? Your head. Come on, this is no time for jokes. Who's joking? Next time you want popcorn, make it yourself. Look, only one guy in the state is good enough to win the Sharpshooter Award. Yes, and it will probably be you, Donnie. That's your problem. You're too good. Things come too easily for you. And then when things don't go your way, all you know how to do is clown around. Oh, yeah? Well, since when do you have it so rough? Cheerleader the banker's daughter. Well, I didn't ask to be the person I am. Yeah, sure, he said, Please, God, make me a dorky little nerd with no tits. That's brilliant, Donny. I thought so. You would. We're going to graduate soon, and all you're going to learn is that you can't hide behind your jackstrap forever. Well, who's hiding, Cindy? Cindy, wait. I didn't put that there. I can't explain what happened last night. I can't. You're a jerk. Beat it, Donny. It's a game tonight. You'll see what kind of guy you're calling a jerk? Fine. Donny, you show me what kind of a guy you are tonight. You just leave me alone today, okay, Dribbling. Block. Come on, Blop. Inbound the ball. Blop. Sorry, Blop. Hey, Sanders, how are we going to win tonight if you can't even hold on to the damn ball? I hit the showers. Wait. Cut. Hey, Dunn. You improved. - We'd usually in the tournament. - Sorry, Coach. I'm in the middle of something important right now. What's more important than the tournament? Hey, Blob. You want to play ball with the big boys? Blob. You better watch your step. Up yours, goat breath. Who was that? I guess we showed him. What are you doing? Hey, I'm experimenting, okay? Well, no more experimenting unless we're together. Fine. And do you suggest we experiment on your friend Donnie at tonight's game? Perhaps. Can you believe that we're going out in front of a thousand people naked? I'd rather have a thousand naked people in front of me. Enjoy the opportunity mode because after the science convention we're not going to be able to get away with this kind of thing anymore. I know what you're thinking, Milton. I wouldn't dream of it. Milton, no worse than what we're about to do. But Donny deserves. There he is. Come on. Wait a minute. Baxter, this is God. I'm not very happy with you. We're looking. Guys, where are you? Leave the cheerleaders alone, Milton. Avery, I wasn't anywhere near you, man. Ain't going to be no sharps, dude. Award for you, Bandit. That's hopefully belongs to me, Chuck Faller. I'm loving life. Duck time. Bandit, get over here. What in the hell do you think he was doing? A great net. You made the whole team suffer, Milton. I just hope no one puts two and two together - after the convention. - Convention? Are you sure you want to do that? What do you mean? I've already got bus tickets for Pittsburgh. Oh, my God. It's only been 20 minutes. The game is over. What the hell do you think you were doing out there? Flopping around like some freaking plunder? Not at all, Mr. Baxter. Maybe it's the steroids or something. Get a hold of yourself, son. Something's wrong, Mr. Baxter. Something's real wrong. Maybe it's what we're doing. There's nothing wrong with you kids. You're just a bad actor. Tomorrow night you get to play your best game. Got to win some to get the bets back up. After the game tomorrow, there's a dance. You meet me when the music starts, and I'll tell you what to do. You said I only had to do this once. Once wasn't enough? What can I say? That if we lose one more game, we're out of the tournament. If I say win it, you win it. If I say lose it, you lose it. Now beat it. I can't believe that backs turned on here rigging the tournament. They're shaving points. If got a minute to walk that far, he would have given his forelegs. There you are. Mr. Baxter's been here? - What are you wearing? - The latest rage. What about Baxter? Mr. Baxter has been here. And he said that he wanted to come over personally and tell me what you did at school tonight and that you've been expelled. We won't be able to go to the school dance tomorrow night. Just what I thought. Each time you take the dust, the length of time your invisible decreases by five minutes. Milton, watch. That's it. It won't work on him anymore. He's a rack. If he gets five minutes shorter each time, we only have three times left. I'm going to Pittsburgh. Now, wait a minute, girl. No. I'm not taking any more chances. How do we explain us to running down the hallway? That's called naked. We can explain later, after we've explored some more possibilities. No, no. Forget it. Better tell my mom I'm going. Let's at least sneak into the girl's locker room. It would be a crime not to do that. Damn it, Grover. I've been whacking off in the shower for so long, I get a hard on when it rained. And now I've got the opportunity of a lifetime, and you are going to waste it. Wrong. I'm going to be sure I don't waste it. What is it? Did you take Dad's notes? The blue paper? - No. - Were you in here? I never come in here. Oh, I did come in here to show Mr. Baxter what you put me through. Don't you ever come in here. Ever. The notes are gone. We got the powder. What the hell good is the powder if we can't show him how to make it? There'll be no proof my Dad invented it. I believe I have wasted the powder playing stupid little tricks on Donnie Sanders. And now now, why didn't I tell the world? Ride the jab. Great game, Donny. Good work. Well, they won. You played very well, Donnie. You deserve to win. Meets you after. You change for nothing. Fun. Why not? You like character. Milton, over here. - Baxter. - What about? He knows that I'm trying to complete Dad's work. My dad taught here. Baxter had access to all of his papers, so he knows my Dad was no kook. And last night he was in my room. Baxter stole the notes with my written editions. I'll be able to make this. So we are going to sneak into his office and see if the notes are there. How about we go to the dance first? No, because the alarms will only off before and after the game when there's a lot of people in the building. Let's go. Come on. Stay right beside me. I'm right here. Grover. Hey, look who's here. They must be waiting for Donny. Why don't you stay with them and find out more about this point? Shaving scam young. Damn it. He must have gone ahead to Baxter's office. Let's jam. Look at these creakness waves. Out of my ways, Weebly. I said out of my way. Yeah, yourself. Good. What do they want? Jimmy Hendrix. Customer. Nice. Who's Cindy? Can't talk right now. I got to meet some who's? Cindy? No. Would you guys break up or what? Of course not. Where is she? She's with the other cheerleaders. She's changing. Indigo shower room. What's it to you? I didn't say anything. - Great game tonight. - Yeah. You get to win the next one, too. Listen, Mr. Baxter, I like winning a lot better than losing. If I win the Sharpshooter award, I get a good scholarship. And you do what I tell you, or I'll show the colleges your real grades. You'll spend the next year flipping burgers. You're the one who said I didn't have to study. What is the matter with you? I don't know. Maybe it's a matter of character. Character? Character? Isn't that your concern, Xanders? I am. You meet me after the next game, and I'll give you your final instructions. Now beat it. Looks like your pigeon is thinking of flying. I don't like that. The hell with your invention. I think we better cool it. This thing's big. Mr. Cristo, I've got to have that money, and I've got to act fast. I'm not the only one who knows about this. The son of the guy who invented this. Yeah. Well, if anything goes wrong, I may teach you how to dress notes, right? Possibly known so much before. Good God. He's got Dad's original formula and he stole my copies. There wouldn't be any proof my dad invented it. Oh, no? What have you done this time? I'm loving life. Now, Grover, you and Donny been having a lot of fun at your house. I sure you'll find it all big, wild be too hot. I'm just looking for a different kind of guy. That's not sounds like Cindy's chilling out. Listen, Debbie, when I find a guy that's right for me, I'll be the one to jump on him. You really have nothing to worry about when I find you. Yeah. You'll get out of here now. - Not yet. - Now. What's the big idea of pulling me out of there? Damn, Milton, if you hadn't been so busy screaming and shouting and running away, why could I told you that Baxter does have our notes and my dad's formula? And you were supposed to go in there - and look for the notes. - Me? Why weren't you in there? Because I got stuck with Baxter. I thought you were in there. And now I have to wait till tomorrow night skiing for and go back there again. I don't care. I'd sacrifice 40 formulas for a look at Sydney Moore's hooters. You're out. No more dust. Tap mine half. Yes, I made the dust. What is going on? Grover, you've changed. Yeah, we have changed. Just not in the same way. Maybe you're right. Go over. Maybe we have changed. I'll take it over and I'll call you tomorrow. Sure has changed. If at first you don't succeed lie, cheat and steal. Write, my little sex kitten, here I come. That dog could have sabotaged the mission. There could be spires lurking anywhere. I've got to be careful. Let's get naked, baby. Henry, have you lost your mind? Just forget it, Donnie. Forget it. Well, I'll help you in any way that I can. Help with him. Except that way, strictly as a friend. Yup. What do you mean, you like the mess? What? Okay, Donnie, look, you can't get character by plugging yourself in like a refrigerator. And I'm sure whatever it is can wait until tomorrow. I'll talk to you later. Bye. I better call him back. Do it tomorrow. I guess you're right. I didn't mean for anyone to see me. He's got bush is a filthy perpetrator. He's got the powder. I didn't mean for anybody to see. Ask him. I swear. Police? This is John. I'm Sergeant Malone at the Valleyville Police Department. I'm Sergeant Terrell, ma'am. What's he done? He may be selling hallucinogenic drugs. Move the center of the roof to heads of the head. Now turn around. Where is it? Mrs. Dunn, what do you do with all this equipment? Mrs. Dunn, have you noticed any changes in your son's behavior? Yes. He's a completely different person. And now he says I'm not allowed in his room. It's tough to love the thing that hurts you most. Yes. I'm alone. We got a job to do here. And who's to say I'm not doing it? I may, Captain, your knife because I'm not something too. Dr. Theodore says I should not have to put up with it. Dr. Theodore, channel 29? That's right, Officer. - Advice for Life... - Day or night. Call me Chuck. Deborah. Deborah. You're the Deborah that calls Dr. Theodore the one with the awful son? Yes, I am. I'm Chuck. Chuck the one who can't get a promotion whose partner makes life miserable for him. It's you. Would you like a cup of coffee? Let's get a cup of coffee. Mom, please. Just Cindy. You want something really weird? - Are you... - No. Look, Grover, I know that Milton didn't just walk into my room last night. He just appeared. Yeah, my can I do a genie or something? Was I going to tell anybody that they'd have taken his boat away? Grover. I just think I deserve to know what's going on. - Grover. - Sit down. I'll tell you. Please. Let me tell you something, Deborah. Just let me tell you something. You're a krimpuff. You are a jellyfish. You're a spineless jellyfish. So Baxter's got my dad's formula. Now he's got the notes, too. Top it all off. I've lost the powder. There you have it. I say you throw it out. How long does it last? First time out, sir? Forget it. Why not? Look what happened to Milton. Look what happened to you. I'll give you some if you promise help me with something really important. Sure. Do you promise to keep this a secret? This stuff is amazing. But what do you do about it? Of course. That's why you and Milton were running out of school naked. You know about that? Of course I know about that. It was all over school. What did you do your first time? We can't talk all afternoon. Deborah, the facts are simple. You haven't been listening to me, and now your son is in trouble with the law. All of your problems stem from the damn kid of yours. Every one of your problems. Now, Deborah, I want you to promise me that as soon as we hang up you better get dressed. - Now. - 30 minutes already, Grover. Damn it. Mother. Knock, knock on your mother. Your assertive mother. All right, where is the little slot? You only have 30 seconds. I have all the time in the world. Now, I know you've got her in here somewhere. She's ha you pop tart. Grandpa, what's wrong with you? Here. Oh, hi, Mrs. Dunn. You said you needed my help. This is a Channel 29 news update. The ball data you must have to show. I'm sorry, Deborah. Milton McClain's escaped. When the jailer brought up his food, he was gone. Nothing there but a pile of clothes. It's really odd. Come in. I can't. I've got to stake out McClain's house. I'll never make captain if Terrell finds him first. You'll find him. I want you to keep your son under surveillance. McClain may come back here. What do you say? Okay. Watch for changes in your son's behavior, especially euphoria. That's how you'll know your son is high. Euphoria. Euphoria. So if I don't get the formula and the notes back, Baxter is going to steal the invention. God knows what I'll do with it. It's just so hard to believe. Especially Donny shaking points. I guess that explains why he was acting so weird during that one game. No, that's because it's just something else. No. What? That's what Donny was talking about over the phone last night. He was trying to tell me he wanted my help, and I let him down. Poor Donny. Poor Donny? Come on, let's not argue about it. I'm going to help you, okay? I'll give you some now so in case something happens to one of us, the other one can still get into Baxter's office. Okay? Come up with a new toilet. Oh, I forgot something. Hello? Yes, this is Deborah Dunn. Send Sergeant Malone to my house as soon as possible. No, I don't want to. Rarel. No, Deborah. Done. I don't feel any euphoria. Harsh. I know what all the fuss is about over here. What? You aren't wearing any clothes. I didn't want to waste any time. I don't last that long anymore. Should we do it? Just wait for the buzzer. We take off your clothes now. Why? I still have 25 minutes. No, it might take 25 minutes. Wonder how long it used to last. Sounds like you won. Okay, now, I'm going to go to Baxter's office, and you follow Baxter. - Meet you back here. - Right. Let's see if you're hiding anything in here. You crook. Hey, great game, kid. All the smart money in the state is going to be on us for the championship tomorrow, kid. Now is the time to lose. Creep. Mr. Baxter Avery is on that team. If I were to throw the game, he would win the Sharpshooter Award and all the scouts would see him. I'm not playing along. Hey, I've got everything on that game. You lose it or you lose your nuts again. Don't be afraid. That's right. Don't be afraid. Just pretend for the moment that you don't even exist. Because in this hour, in this session, we are going to talk about self awareness. Coming audio consent for your car at books and all. Learn how to be an assertive person, how to get your way, how to lay blame where it belongs on someone else. What's his problem? Any problems? Oh, damn. Formula Singapore kindness. Sir, it is of the utmost importance that we begin production of your product before world competitors discover secret. Therefore financing must be in place by March 10th. It's tomorrow. Warmest personal regards, R. Wang Furger. Furger? I found Dad's formula. What's he doing here? I forget it. I'm going. No, no, wait a minute. This was too important. Now, are we just going to stand aside and let Baxter ruin his life? Look, Baxter's moving fast. He's getting ready to start mass production on Dad's invention. Well, I'm not even going to Pittsburgh. Nah, I'm telling everybody. Newspapers. Now go over. You can't. Okay, a Baxter still has your notes, right? With the missing ingredients penciled in by you, which makes that just as valuable as the completed formula. Look, I'll tell if you step forward now, he will, too. And who are they going to believe? If you do anything now, you're going to tip them off. He'll tip him off. Oh, yeah, Mr. Righteous. We figured out what you did. Cindy's house the game. Why don't you just put on some clothes? Look, the best way to beat bastard for good is to just play a trap for him. Discredit him. Otherwise, he's free to do whatever he wants with your invention, and he'll string you up for the rest of your life. I hope you're not suggesting I play to win. There's no telling what Baxter do. Baxter is planning on using the money that he makes off this game to start marketing on my dad's invention. If we lose that game, Baxter gets everything. Dad and I get nothing. If I hold off, then we have to win. I'm not sure if we can win. Avery's on that team, and he's good. We'll win. Cindy, you and I will do what Milton and I did to Donny, except to Avery. That way it'll look like we won. The spite of Donny, Baxter is still going to be mad science. He's no match for somebody who's invisible. Because if we win and Baxter is still on the loose, I'm Donna dog Food, Grover. Look, just remember, I'm doing this for Dad, not for him. Grover. You better slow down. Honey, I know that. You're really upset with me tonight. Are you jealous? You're not going to talk to me. What is it? The powder is gone. No. What are we going to do? Make more. Come on. Get started. Now this stuff were simple to make. It would have been discovered a long time ago. Valgo Bayer, 60. Iron City Cougars, 64. Here they come to Cooper after two the games already in the second half. Almost done. So many ingredients are a little different. It doesn't work. Something I figured out. You see those numbers? That's the code. Disappearing powder. We've got it. All right. What? Jump flowers. You better stand back. Ready? Here it comes. What? A toilet pool cleanser does work. - You mean your dad? - Yes. Now Baxter is going to start mass production on the invisible powder. I think he has a toilet bowl cleanser. Can you imagine what's going to happen? There will be people all over the world turning invisible by accident. And then they could be running around gulping every toilet bowl cleanser at the site. There's going to be dead toilet cleanser chunks all over the place. We're not going to have any power to stop them. The great inventor. You didn't even invent the invisible power. I didn't? I wasted all of you. Wasted? I got nothing. You got to hide me. What's he doing here? Sent by the angels. I'll help you, Milton, if you tell me where you put the power you stole. Okay, I'll tell you, Grover. But you got a promise to give me enough to stay invisible until this thing is over. Look, I promise. You got to bring me some right now. All right. It's in the guitar outback. If you don't want the powder so bad, then why didn't he just get it himself? I can't feel it. Whoever. Why did he go to your room? We probably would have came inside because he's awesome. You're under arrest. You too. You can't arrest us with him. Guys, please. Look in the hand. No more Mr knight fasted by Avery Just hope you goodbye, Ben. Out bears. Okay, kids, start easing up. Keep up. That's all I can do to keep up. Just start easing up. I don't want to take any chances. Grover, are you there? Who's our way further? I don't know. Look, the game is almost over. You're not going to be able to stop anybody. Donny is in danger. The whole world is in danger. I'm confused. Yes. You've got to believe us. I do not believe that powder makes anybody invisible. It makes your run around naked and end up in the puzzle house. Look, if you would just come to the game with us, you could see we were telling the truth. You could rest Baxter and get promoted to captain. If I arrested Lester Baxter, I'd be nobody in a big hurry. What is it? Good Lord, please. There's not much time. Hey, that's good enough for me. Hey, I can't go out like this. Take off your clothes to bring them with. You right. The game's about to end. Push the star, please. Avery. Shoot. Watch out. I got to talk to you. I'm not going to explain this. Great places with me. Are you on to something? No more. Did you see that Milton kid? - Maybe we should try to explain. - Explain? You're not even here to explain. That's true. Okay, Cindy, take someone to dust. What about you? He's going to see you. So I got to say, my last ghost for the game. Just take some. I can't. What the hell is that? Watch out! Go right. Go left. I'm headed south. Past the market. Yeah. Millions of dollars sometimes. Why do you want to pet them? I don't know. What's that corner? Okay, now I'm going to take the powder and go straight to the gym with Cindy. Oh, my God. What is it? The car wash. The car wash. Okay, Cindy, you've only got about three minutes left. Now it's up to you. We've got to win. Loan. You and I are going to go to the storage room till you become visible. Then you can make the arrest. - Right. Ready? - Yes. 1 minute left and we're behind. Where'd you been all day, sucker? No, you don't. I'm running out of time. Donna, you may have to win us to start. I don't think I can. I'll be visible in less than a minute. We're going to do anything. It has to be now. Don't worry about him. He's got a copper. Donny, we have to try? Donny set it up. We have an injury timeout with 35 seconds left. And it's Iron City 98, Valleyville 93. They're staying with a Murphy. Cindy, bad news. Hello? Yes. We're gonna need your help. They've got something on the bench and they're taking a look. We don't know how it happens, but I doubt we'll be seeing any more of Xanders today. What's that doing here? Might make me nervous. We got to get out of here. There's a story tell down the hall from the gym and wait in there. Let's go. Mix. Now we'll just climb up the cable at the rear of the backboard. Are you sure I'm going to get back in time for the arrest, but I'll stall back, sir, to after the game's over. Just make sure your balls don't go into the basket. Right. Here it goes. Good luck. Okay. Too much time, Donna. You got to put somebody else goats me. Donny. What are you doing here? Once in the game him. I don't care if you do feel stupid. You'll be safe from that cop. Still keeping on back stuff. And the Bears win the game. Man. Where do you think you're going? We still have to victim it here. You see anybody come out of here? A couple of bears. - Bears? - Yes. Went to the gym. Get back in here. Where'd they go? Thank you. Freeze. Don't anybody move. No, you don't understand. Now take off those stupid masks. Now. Suppose somebody tells me what's going on around here? Point shady, that's what's going on. Baxter is involved, too. You shut up. You're in enough trouble already. Kid is innocent, Terrell. You should listen to him. Who said that? I did. Terrell, you old pugnucker. You are about to make the rest of your life. Where is your uniform? Two R's and two L's. I'd like to say to the youth of Valley Authority figures well, and take example, it looks like he's going to make captive. I've been thinking, who gives the damn least Baxter was caught. Searched everywhere for your dad's notes. Baxter swears he doesn't have them. There's nothing more we can do now. Sorry. Come on, I'll drive you home. Grover, just wanted to say thanks. All of you guys. There is the visible you, what you are perceived to be by others. And then there is the invisible you. What you aspire to be, but can't be because other people are always forever. More messing up your lives. Death Note. It was you. I had to. You're going to go blow everything at your dorky convention. And this time, remember to marry it. I think I need a vacation. I've been thinking. Since I'm not going to make captain, I'm going to have a lot more time for our honeymoon. You like a cup of coffee? Let's get a cup of coffee. When you got home from school, it had miraculously turned into the invisible powder. There's something you're not telling us, Milton. You used all of your six times. Why did you want more powder? Musta miscounted. Okay, after my 6th time, I tried it. Nothing happened. And then I tried it again and it lasted 30 minutes. Cycle starts over. Yeah, but only she got the power. I mean, you don't even know how you did it. But we do have the toilet bowl cleaner. Now there's an idea you can sell. Shall I get started on this? I do agree. What ingredient do you add to a toilet bowl? Cleanser. Change it from a disappearing powder to a powder that makes you disappear. Something organic, I guess. Something that got into the goo after I left her school. We may never find out this was all for nothing. Wasn't all for nothing. You're right. It wasn't all for nothing. We're staying in the pigeons bathroom. It's better go inside. What's with all these pigeons anyway? I don't know. They've always been wow. There aren't any pigeons at my house. And I live right next door. I don't know why they're here. I just wish they're you live behind your day dreams.
