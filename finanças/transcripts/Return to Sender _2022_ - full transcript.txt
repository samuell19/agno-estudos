Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Thank you. We have a new member joining our program this week. I know she just moved into her new place. How are you settling in, Julia? Yeah, hi, I'm Julia. I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Julia. Yeah, I was living with my sister, but I knew I needed to take control of my life and get away. So this place is not Costa Rica, but it's mine. And as long as I come to these, I can have that. So yeah, here I am. Anything else, Julia? Alright, thank you, Julia. Let's see, we have a few announcements before we start. We'll have two 10-minute speakers... Thank you so much. ♪ I know I'm inviting ♪ ♪ So new and exciting ♪ ♪ When you don't know me at all ♪ ♪ When the novelty wears off ♪ ♪ After all is said and done ♪ ♪ Will you still like me? ♪ ♪ When the butterflies are gone ♪ ♪ When the butterflies are gone ♪ ♪ I hope you don't mind it ♪ ♪ There's so much behind it... ♪ The serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I... Yeah, if you could just double check that I didn't actually purchase those? Could you spell your address? 1038, Cypress, C-Y-P-R-E-S-S. Thank you. Can I put you on a brief hold as I find this for you? Sure. Hello, is Julia still there? Yup. Hi, I'm here. I just went through your account. The last charge we have on record is a purchase totaling 140 dollars and 23 cents That includes a wallpaper smoothing tool kit-- I know, these are packages that I received today with your label on them. I don't know if I have an old account that's been hijacked or what, I just wanna know what's going on! I apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused. Mistakes like these can happen at our warehouse sometimes. You're welcome to return the items to us, or if you wanna hold on to them- That's fine, I'll just return them. Sounds great. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Hi there, someone is posting reviews in my name for items I did not order. Hi. Yes, I'm calling because my credit card has been compromised. Can you please transfer me to your security department? Please, continue to hold and we will be with you shortly. Yeah, I need you guys to track a package for me. I'm getting things from an unsolicited sender. The number is 773-3028. Hello? Yes! Hi, I'm here. Is Fran still there? It's Julia, Julia Day, 1038, Cypress Lane. One second. Jesus Christ. Yes, Julia, I'm looking at your account history right now. It appears the reviews mentioned are not under your account. I see here the most recent use of your account was a purchase totalling 140 dollars and 23 cents... Yes, I know that, okay? Another user is posting reviews for products under an account, but with my name, okay? I need you to shut them down. I understand, ma'am. Unfortunately, I can't share any details about other accounts, but I'm looking at your information right now and I can assure you, your account has not been compromised. No, you're not listening to me, alright? I am being frauded, alright, do you understand? You're not. Is there anything else I can-- Julia, thank God. Are you okay? Tat, no, listen... I think someone's targeting me or something, like someone's like... No, no, Julia, it's okay. I just read your text and I looked it up, and what's happening to you is called brushing. Brushing? Yeah, brushing... it's like this scam where some asshole gets paid to send you products so they can write a 'verified' review in your name. They want reviews? So long as there's proof the product shipped to someone, they write verified reviews for money. It's completely a scam. It's really shitty... No, I... I mean, they had all my information, I... I had to change my card. That's what's so weird about it, they don't charge anyone's cards. They just want reviews. And so people end up with a bunch of crap... but that's it. They sent me a corkscrew. What? They sent me a corkscrew! I thought maybe they knew that... I don't know. No... I think it's just a coincidence. Check to see if it was a sponsored product. I think that's what they do. It's just a stupid, random thing, it's not you. Okay. I was worried someone could see me. I'm only an hour and a half away, I can come down this weekend... or something? I mean, if you want, I-- Yeah, I'll be there. You know, it's hard to hear you like this when we're not living together anymore, and I... I can't-- Why don't we talk about it later, okay? We can talk about that later. Well I mean, it's like what mom says, right? Focus on what you can control. So... what are you gonna do tonight? Wallpaper. That sounds good. Then what? Julia, you there? Hello? Julia, are you still there? Are you okay? You know what, actually, I... I need to let you go, okay? Have a good night, I love you. Okay, I love you. Are you-- Our surveillance on this street is pretty touch and go, but I'll let you know if we find any-- Hey, um... Let me know if you change your mind, okay? I don't have to come, but I want you to know I'm here for you, you don't have to do this alone. I'm proud you're taking control. Talk soon. I love you. TAT? TAT!? My God. No, no, no! Okay, okay, okay, okay. God... Hey... God... Let me know if you change your mind, okay? I don't have to come, but I want you to know I'm here for you. you know, you don't have to do this alone. I just... ...I'm proud you're taking control. Talk soon. Let me know if you change your mind, okay?
