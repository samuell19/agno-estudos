I found you, L clan! Kazuma? Sorry. Did you wait long? No. Hana. Yes. I really think it's a terrible thing... to betray the person you love. There's no good reason for someone to do that. What should I say? - I'm truly... - I'm sorry! What? Actually, I went on a blind date... without telling you. He's talking about that? We're supposed to get married, but I did such a thing. I'm really, really sorry. But you have my word that I turned her down properly. I told her I have someone I love. Do you really like her? Yes. Since the first time we met, I fell hard. So, he was talking about me? Hana... Last night around 6pm, where were you? Why do you ask? Could you tell me? I was at home. Look. Dad, Mom. Congratulations on your 35th wedding anniversary. Continue being good to each other, okay? Wedding anniversary? Tomorrow is my parents' wedding anniversary. My grandma and I planned to give them a surprise. Sorry, let me take a look. (Thursday, 18:04) The time of the incident was... Kazu? I'm an idiot. I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry, Hana. I'm sorry. Don't cry. Don't cry! You didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one at fault. Why must I be... Master. Give me another one of this. Sure thing. Welcome. I see you. Can I sit beside you? Please. Such cute eyebrows. Our next target is a very capable female thief. She has been all around the world, seducing men... with pretty words and deliberate wardrobe malfunctions... to get close and then steal their belongings. What a lowly woman. I'm back. Among the prizes is the legendary diamond, Romeo and Juliet... that she stole from an Arabic oil tycoon. It is worth 20 billion. - Twenty billion? - Yes, the price tag is hefty. A long, long time ago, a prince and princess from two feuding families fell in love. The two managed to be together after overcoming obstacles. The diamond given to the princess as a symbol... of everlasting love is none other than this Romeo and Juliet. Just like the original story. Yes, a very touching one. My dear, I want it for our wedding anniversary. You need to calm down. But that's what I want right now. Go and get it for me. - We can't at the moment. - Why? We haven't located the woman yet. Plus, she has two bodyguards who are ruthless. They are enchanted by the woman... and will do anything she asks. That woman has been given a grand name. Master Doronjo. What Master Doronjo? It only made me want to get her more. Hana, let's go and punish this lowly female thief. No, I'm not doing that ever again. I've had enough of lying. I don't want to hurt him again. Why? You heard what we said, right? Are you okay with her being called Master Doronjo? I don't care about Master Doronjo. (Daughter of Lupin: Episode 5) Can't see it. Can't see it. How about this? Almost can't see it. Do you want to see it? Yes. Don't rush. Go shower first. Okay. He's gone. That's all? It's not even a black card. What's with the rich man badge? He's nothing but a furry-browed, penniless man. Ms. Miwa. The guy is... (Police Department, Maki Junichi) A police officer? Dad, Mom. Congratulations on your 35th wedding anniversary. Hana, did something happen? Grandma. Is it about Kazuma? I showed this to Kazu. Luckily we prepared this beforehand. An alibi. I'm recording. Now, ready... Start. Dad, Mom. Congratulations on your 35th wedding anniversary. What's the matter? Is he suspecting you again? No. He believed me straight away after I showed this to him. There's no problem then. Hana? Grandma. "Hana, what a surprise." "My parents' wedding anniversary is also tomorrow." "If you don't mind, what about celebrating together at my house?" What is he talking about? There's no way. Why? That sounds like a good idea. A double wedding anniversary party. - Right, dear? - Sounds great. We haven't formally paid a visit to Sakuraba anyway. This is bad. Within this month, we've received many reports of men... being seduced by a woman and later robbed in hotels. This is a CCTV recording of the woman. - What's wrong? - Nothing. A few of the victims... did not return home nor show up at work. They've gone missing. We need to catch her quickly. Got that? - Yes, sir. - Yes. Hana, look over here Why don't you forget about that marriage conman? He has a lover Yet he meets with another woman He's nothing but a lying wolf No I'm the one who lied. Hana. Awesome! He's amazing! Hana... Just come with me. Believe me, I didn't do it. I know. You can tell me all about it. - Sorry. - Sorry. Don't look at me. Sorry. - So you work at the headquarters. - Yes. I'm from the criminal general affairs section. I see. If it's okay, could you spend some time with me later... to read poetry? Did you just ask me out? Don't look at me. Sorry. My family... is having a wedding anniversary party later today. Here you go. - Thank you. - There. Can you manage? There. Thank you. See you. Kazuma, tighten it more. (Happy Wedding Anniversary August 3, Sakuraba and Mikumo) Yes, that's good. Hana, thank you for preparing that. Not at all. - Come, Grandma. - Yes, thank you. Hana, are you free later? - Why? - I want to take you to a place. Okay. Hana. It's over if they find out that his family is all police officers. Don't worry. Leave it to me. What a coincidence. I never thought our wedding anniversaries are on the same day. - Here, please. - Thank you. Not to mention baseball too. We sure share a lot of similarities, Mr. Sakuraba. Sorry for the last-minute invitation. I mentioned it to Hana since it's a rare chance... to celebrate together. Hey, is the finger food not ready? Is this okay? Thanks. You should sit too, Kaori. Is that your daughter? Nice to meet you. I'm Shintani Kaori. Mosquitoes. - I'll light a mosquito coil. - Okay. What an amazing reflex. She probably got that from my father. Where are you going? Where? This is food for the dog, right? Dog food? It's not. It's not? You're kidding. Are humans supposed to eat this? You don't have to. I see you are still so rude. Who's the one being rude? You're serving dog food on our wedding anniversary? Mom, please stop. Since it's a wedding anniversary, I'd like to hear about how you guys met. Let's start with you, Dad. Tell us. Well, we met while working on the scene. Nothing out of the ordinary. The body is still warm. Time of death is probably 30 minutes prior. The cause of death is a head injury. The murder weapon is likely this. Sorry. Is that so? Your hands touched. It's a little embarrassing to say it. I felt a little zap when it happened. A lightning marriage? That's what happened to us too, right? Yes. We met while at work too. At the time, Etsuko was still a newbie full of energy. Did your hands touch too? Incredible. Even the way you two met is similar. I felt like a lightning went through us too. You guys had a lightning marriage too. Mrs. Mikumo? Yes, I guess we do see eye to eye on some things. I suppose so. Now, let's hear about how Kazuma and Hana... - started dating. - Sounds good. Before that, excuse me while I go to the toilet. Kazuma, please show him the way. It's okay. I know the way. - Sorry? - Sadakichi! Kazuma, this is the first time the Mikumos are visiting, right? I believe so. It's because your house is like my grandma's old house. Sadakichi. Where did you go? It's okay, Grandma. - Calm down. - Sadakichi. She should lie down. Dear, come and help. Grandma, come lie down. - Use the cushion as a pillow. - Yes, use the cushion. Excuse me. Let me help. Okay. Can you dry them for me? Sure. You met Hana at the library? Yes, she was crying when we first met. Looks like Kazuma is weak against a woman's tears. Actually, I was really touched when I saw her in that state. Like a zap went through you? Well... - Kazuma looks happy. - I'm embarrassed to say it. It's the first time seeing him so serious. Will there be another lightning marriage? He said he will marry you no matter what. Even Mom who was so opposed to the relationship was convinced. She now supports you two getting married. He can be kind of rigid and boring. But he's a good person. Please make him happy. Look. Amazing. As soon as I heard about this place, I thought of bringing you here. Thank you. If we're lucky, we can even see Perseus meteor showers in this season. But I don't think we'll see it tonight. Is that the Milky Way? It's that one there. This reminds me... of the Valentine's Day when we first met. Let's say if we get married like this, it'd be a lightning marriage too, right? I guess so. Hana. Right now, I'm the happiest man alive. Thank you. What's this all of a sudden? Meeting you, falling in love with you, and having you by my side. I really cherish the time we spend together like this. It's the Perseus meteor. I'm going to make a wish. I'm back. Where are the rest? They've gone to bed. Kazuma. This is Hana's, right? It is. - I'll return it. - Okay. That was so nice. Finally, it feels more like an anniversary. What are you saying? To me, every day with you is like an anniversary. Gosh, dear. Say that again. Again. Again... Sorry, Etsuko. Can you head home first? Tell me again later. That was a nice change. Celebrating anniversaries together. If you get married, we'll have more chances to interact with one another. I know you're worried. Leave the rest to me. I'll make sure things go smoothly, okay? Hana? There's no way that will happen. Why? Why are we thieves? Why must we do this for a living? Why? I've had enough of lying to him. But if I stay with him, I'll have to continue to lie. I... no longer know what to do. Weird. They're not back yet? (Mom) Hello. What? Hana? No, I'm Sakuraba. Hana left her phone at my house. I see. Hold on, she just got back. Hana, it's Kazuma. -What? - Take the call. Hello? Hana. Thanks for today. Not at all. I should thank you. By the way, you forgot your phone. Sorry. Where are you right now? I just got home. Home? You're at home right now? Yes. I'll go and get the phone. No. It's already late. I'll return it to you tomorrow. Okay. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Wataru. Have you located the woman? Still working on it. But I've found the bar that she frequents. Etsuko. Spend the anniversary with somebody else. What? Why? There's another woman I'd like to be with. Another woman? Who? Does he have another woman? You tricked me? You went to the hotel with me willingly. You seem to have a pretty good background. That surprised me. Your grandfather was the former superintendent general, Maki Esuke. You did a background check on me? Only people with an annual income over 20 million... get to have the rich man badge. That belonged to your grandfather, right? Shut up. Give me back my police ID. I can. Only if you do as I say. What do you want? I want to know all the information the police have... on the L clan so far. L clan? This margarita is from that gentleman over there. What a strange feeling. Somehow, I feel like this isn't our first meeting. Me too. Tangy. I'd like to spend the night with you tonight. Come out. Spend the night? What a creep. - Dear, it's almost ready. - Morning. Don't talk to her right now. I'm worried you might get food poisoning. So I heat it up for you. He hasn't come home from fooling around all night. It might be that. Whatever! Just shut up. Leave it if you won't eat it. So much for every day being an anniversary to you. A whole load of crap! Dad, Mom. Congratulations on your 35th wedding anniversary. Continue being good to each other, okay? I'm Sakuraba from the Third Division. Please put me through to Hashimoto Emili. I'm sorry. I don't have any contacts at the research lab. So I thought you could help me out. Sure. I have a friend from the same year. I asked her to investigate for me. What did she find out? (Investigation Report) (Investigation Report. Target: Mikumo Hana's mobile phone) I'm sorry you had to come here to return it. Here you go. Thanks. I need to get back to work. I'll get going too. Bye. Bye. (Investigation Report) This recording... was supposedly done on the morning of the 2nd. Morning of the 2nd? The date of the recording was changed. Meaning it's a fake video. Don't you remember? You caught him. Did I? - It's Ms. Hana, right? - What? I thought I heard her voice. It's definitely her. - Kazuma, listen. - Yes. That female thief? I was unknowingly tricked. You went to the hotel with her? I now understand how a victim feels after being one myself. The wardrobe malfunction was hard to resist. So what did she steal from you? My wallet. My police ID is in it. That woman contacted me last night. And? She would keep quiet about me being tricked. She'd also return my ID. In exchange, she wants all the information we have on the L clan. What did you say? I'm going to meet her tonight. But it doesn't mean I've agreed to the deal. I'm just luring her out. Sorry, Kazuma, but I need your help. Listen. Can you let me handle it on my own? No. I caused the mess. I can't have my subordinate... Can you? Welcome to Diamond Tours. You are about to visit the wonderland of... Republic of Madan. Take a look at this amazing natural beauty. Hear the sound of waves. In this place, there are still many diamonds to be uncovered. Unearthing diamonds for a beloved... is a man's way to show his love. Now, we shall head outside. Let's go! Welcome to Diamond Tours. You are about to visit the wonderland of... Republic of Madan. Unearthing diamonds for a beloved... is a man's way to show his love. Now, we shall head outside. Let's go! Where's Maki Junichi? He's not coming. I'm his subordinate. What a coward. He let his subordinate clean up his mess. Hand over the police ID. First, give me the information. It's all in here. Are you playing with me? What is this piece of paper? And it's blank. Zero points. Take him away. (Ladybug No. 3, Ten) - I'm back. - Hana. Take a look at this. - What? - This. Kazu? What's going on? I'd like to know too. Dad got tricked by that woman and was captured. He fell for a wardrobe malfunction? Dad, release Ladybug No. 3. It finally flew. It can finally fly after many modifications. I get why Dad is there. But why Kazuma too? I'm not sure, but it's a serious situation. The crazy woman... is going to send all the men she seduced... to the Republic of Madan to dig for diamonds. I won't let that happen. I'm not going to let him dig diamonds for that woman. Hana, let's go. But I don't want to be a thief anymore. Kazuma is going to spend his life digging diamonds too. Are you fine with that? You won't be able to see him again. Hana, make up your mind. There's no time. All right. This is going to be the last time. I will save him. Countless treasures are hidden in this location. Difficulty of invasion is not high. But the risks increase the farther you go. Why? Anti-theft lasers were installed in order to protect the treasures. It will be hard to navigate. So far, none of the thieves who infiltrated... had any success. Is there no other way? None. Wait, what happens if we're hit by the lasers? You'll be burned. I can't do it. My body is too stiff. Me neither, I'm a homebody. Mom can't do it too. She's too old. Hana wouldn't be able too. Who will do it then? I know someone who can get through the lasers. Sorry for the wait, Hana. Thank you, Mr. Enzoji. I expected nothing less from the world-class thief, Enzoji Akiyo. Not just a man who loves to sing. Let's get going. - Grandma. - I'll do it. Done. Hana, let's go. Be careful. Why do you want information on L clan? Because I don't like them. They keep taking things that I had my eyes on. Their existence is getting in the way. Besides, having one female thief is enough. No need for others. Has the next ship arrived? It will arrive at 11pm. Ship? Wishing you a safe journey... to the Republic of Madan. Republic of Madan? All the men who fell for me are working hard there... to uncover diamonds for me. You're not just a thief, are you? Men are such stupid creatures. Give them a little something and they submit obediently. Well? Are you going to spend your life digging diamonds for me? Or perhaps, you would rather tell me what you know about L clan. Make up your mind. I can tell you. First of all, they are not opponents you can handle. Who do you think you're speaking to? I'll be the winner in the end. - Oiwa. - Yes. Take this idiot away. Show him a good time. Master Miwa, we've got a problem. What is it? The men are gone. What happened? Where are they? I don't know. But when I got here... When you got here what? A ladybug was cutting the ropes. Are you stupid? How could a ladybug cut the ropes? - I'm telling you the truth. - Idiot! It's the L clan. Noda, the diamond. Check if the diamond is there. Yes, ma'am. Oiwa, take the idiot away. Yes. Get going. Now stay here quietly. So this is the Romeo and Juliet. - Aren't you the creep? - My, oh my. Isn't this the one and only Golden Mask? This is the valuable Faberge Easter egg. You little scum. Darn you! Darn you! Gosh, men these days are so useless. - Dear. - What's the matter, Etsuko? I should be asking you that. How could you fall for that woman's trap! Wait, it's a misunderstanding. I only wanted to give this to Hana as soon as possible. Me? This... should belong to the couple that have overcome difficulties, a proof of love. Etsuko and I don't need it. Why did you have to do it alone? Because getting through the lasers is too hard. So I decided to get caught on purpose. You're so smart, dear. Dad, did you see Kazu? Yes, Kazuma has been caught too. Him again? He's probably in the other room. We shall head back first. How about Kazuma? He is Hana's treasure. Let her retrieve it. Found you. I found the L clan. You must be the lowly female thief. Lowly? Making men submit to you. Did you think you'd be queen? What's wrong with that? Do not hurt people you love. Another idiot. What love? Do you really think such a thing exists? I'm teaching those stupid men a lesson. There's no love in this world. Only domination. The moment they fall for me marks their demise. Love is not about winning or losing. Yes, it is! Love and relationship all end someday. Who's the loser then? It's the one who was more in love. If so, it's better not to fall in love in the first place. Love and whatever. It's nothing but an illusion. Even if it is just an illusion, I am still going to protect the love I have. Stop trying to be noble! Who are you? It's your tough luck meeting me today. For all the crimes you've committed, learn penitence. Can you let me handle it on my own? Are you planning to catch her together with the L clan? L clan. I don't know why they keep appearing near me. I'm sure they'll show up again if I go. Don't come. I'm sorry I keep testing you. I thought if you were the L clan, you'd definitely come. Whenever I get into trouble, you'd always appear in time... and save me. But the truth is, I wish you wouldn't show up. If you do, that means you and I... Hana. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (To be continued) Because I'm the daughter of thieves. We're bound to break up. I've come to terms with my destiny. - Stop! - I hope you'll pay attention to me. It's okay to kill the L clan if you find them. I'll go by myself. - Hana? - How could this be? (This drama is a work of fiction.)
