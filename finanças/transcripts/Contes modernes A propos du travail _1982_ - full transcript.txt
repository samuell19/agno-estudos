Job advert A coffee please. Thanks. The Chimiefaden company please. -Second floor on the left sir. -Thanks. Excuse me, I'm here about the job. The job? Please take a seat. OK, thanks. Sir? It's your turn. Thanks. -André Joguain? -Yes? Please follow me sir. Sir? It's your turn. -Sit sir. -Thanks. -We made you wait for quite a while. -That's alright. Well, so that's Mr... Pelletier, Mathieu Pelletier. You read about this vacancy in the press? Yes, through the press. How long have been looking for a job? For five months. I was dismissed five months ago. It was an economical dismissal. Do you know what the position is? -Yes Yes, it's a job that seem to completely match with my skills - we can't have every skill anyway. With my knowledge and my experience as well. Well, can you talk about your experience? Yes, I stayed in a big firm for 8 years, that I left for... Well, on one hand after 8 years I thought that maybe this was the time to retrain. And on the other hand, I ended up thinking that I didn't have as much future in this company as I thought. What were you doing there? I was in the head office, in the purchasing department. And after? I worked with another company, the 3001 Company. You stayed there? Not long, a dozen or so months. What happened there? Well, I thought that the experience I had could be used for an interesting commercial experiment. The following events proved me right. And the results I obtained were rather satisfying. As paradoxical as it may seem, they were too satisfying. That is that the company could absorb all the orders that I found. So at first we were pleased when we saw the orders coming. And then, the company couldn't handle them. We left aside some old clients in order to deal mostly with two big clients that I found. Well... The deal collapsed. I think that it was predictable, and the management should have predicted it. But the fact is that the management didn't predict it. The company collapsed and that's why I'm unemployed. And what was your annual salary at this job? 54,000 francs, plus charges. So distinctly lower than what we offer. And why do you look for work in business, what's attracting you? I think I was a good negotiator, and that I mixed easily with the people I was facing, who were sellers. So I wish to make good use of this experience. After 8 years, you realize... you realize what to say and not to say, how to behave and how not to behave. I am even more firm in that idea since I obtained in that company some rather satisfying results. So what type of job are you currently looking for? Still in purchasing. With some freedom of choice, some kind of independence. OK, would it be a problem, on the family side, if you were to move house? No, nothing serious since we've thought about it. I haven't been unemployed for very long compared to some. Plus I'm 47 years old, I have 3 children and I'm aware of my family responsibilities. So, in the event of sacrifices that need to be made, well, I'll make them. For the general interest. What if you find a job and your wife loses hers, because I assume that she works? I think she has the faculty to adapt. And I won't go off on an adventure leaving my family behind. So, if there's a need to move out, I think that after a few months, my wife and kids could come, too. -What was your high school specialty? -Philosophy. And after? A year of law. -Only one year, why? -Well... because my father died in 1955. So we had some financial difficulties. I say that since it didn't obstruct the rest of my career. So, the philosophy specialty, the year in law school, the military service, I chose to forget about all this to go straight to active life in a precise professional branch. So, I'll talk about the job we offer. We're the Chimiefaden Company, and currently, it's like that: There's an important head office in Paris, near the Santé Prison. A factory in Dôle that employ around 400 people, and a factory in Rouens with 750 people. Chimiefaden used to be called Pic Chimiefaden, it is now only Chimiefaden. Pic became one of its subsidiaries. Recently the company had a lot of problems. In France the field is stuck and abroad there's a lot of competition. So we had to restructure. The headquarters will be moved to Rouens where there only was a small office. The main office was at the headquarters. Now the technical management and the general management will be on-site. Only the commercial branch will stay in Paris. When there are some foreign visitors you have to receive them in Paris. This headquarters transfer will force people to change their mindsets. You have to think of profitability and competitiveness. So we need purchasers always alert but who also listen to the technicians. -Yes. -So that's more or less it. Listen, I'll tell you frankly, even while disregarding the salary offer, that this job seems to completely match - I'll tell you frankly, even naively, as I said earlier - my skills and experience. So, this advert, you'll see it again soon, and you'll compete against other applicants. So I'll ask you to write a hand-written cover letter in due form and your detailed curriculum vitae. Good, that will be done. I have all the applicants' letters for the purchaser job. Do I send them to Simone Herlin or do you want to read them first? No, ask for a quick sort first, express option. Simone Herlin, psychologist, graphologist, recruitment advisor. So, this one... a kid, a diploma... stock-controller... for... Too thin. Dryness. Inverted in both ways. Inferiority. So, let's see. Technical diploma... hardware store, tools store, department store... Straight lines hardly held. Not focused enough. This one is probably depressed. Let's go. Another. So, that's good. So, divorced, employed as fitter,... Sinuous writing. Savoir-faire but lacks self confidence. In the middle it goes. Not bad. High school in Marne, technical diploma,... Angular writing. Rigor and firmness. That's good. Oh, he doesn't write his salary ambitions. That's not good. Well... I'll still give him a plus. Not bad. Married, science and technical diploma. Knowledge of German. Good spacial organization. Good, interesting personality. Oh... no. Spelling mistakes. That's a minus. Alright. 47 years old, married, 3 children. Yes. Enough space, knowledge of the spirit.

Yes, but very fast so... in the middle. Accounting, connection. Yes, left margin too wide, let's not exaggerate. Backward-looking, self-effacing. Far from reality. Three. One A. Two minus. Three. Wow, three. Value table. 1+ : very valuable Two minus. 1 : valuable 1A : rather valuable Two. 2+ : better than average 2 : average 2- : below average 3 : bad Two. Subdivisions are possible, for example: 1+/1, 2+/2. One plus and one plus, here. According to Simone Herlin's report, there are two applicants that can be picked. It's Mr. Legrand and Mr Pelletier. Let me see. Yes, she even gave them the same rating, what's that? That's the most favorable rating. The value of the person and their match for the job are satisfactory. Yes. We need a more detailed analysis. Ask for it. Yes, that's good. Simplicity, elegance of the shapes. Yes. Simplified definitions. Well dressed, cultured. So... Swift lines, simple. Uprightness, organized. Method. Tight pressure. Intent. Practical intelligence. The personal profile: The applicant's essential trait is his practical intelligence. This provides a great adaptability at work. Diplomacy is one of his means of action because he has a quite sharp psychological sense. And for Mr. Legrand Capable of methodical analysis of problems, he's probably one of the most clever applicants for this job. Regarding social behavior, for Mr. Pelletier: Receptive toward social issues, he seems to have interesting human qualities reconciling authority, courtesy and skill. For Mr. Legrand: We can be sure of his dedication and of his conscientiousness when his activity satisfies his aspirations. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I don't know, what do you think? What do you think? This science, graphology, psychology is already outdated. And its function, management advice, is completely obsolete. Today, thanks to linguistics and some researcher's work, there are some more modern methods. Phonology for example, by neglecting the content of the sentences to only focus on the expression and symbolism of the phonemes, allows to determine the degree of aggressiveness, of docility, of malleability, and other trait of the unconscious in a given subject. subs by gundenspand
