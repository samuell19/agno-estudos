I want to die with dignity. But when an execution's carried out in my world, there's no military parade, no music, no march past. It's just a hideous death. No guilt. And no remorse. That's the way it's always been. But now that I've got death staring me in the face, why should I accept it? I knew that whoever killed Tony and the lads could still be out there. And with every day that went by, the anger and the frustration got worse... until I felt the paranoia slowly suffocating me. Essex had changed, become darker. The pill-popping, acid house days were long gone. Coke had taken over. Some nights, I could smell the crack seeping out the pores of their skin. Where's the fucking gear? He said he sorted you out a couple of packets already. Yeah. That's right. I've taxed your fellow, now I'm taxing you. Where's the fucking gear? It's gone, Carl. I've sold my last one... - Really? Really? Really? What's this?! - Yes. It ain't in my fucking fanny either. Fuck's sake, Carlton. Lift it up. And that. And what's this, eh? What's this? Fucking prick, Carlton. You're a fucking cunt! Do you hear me? You're a fucking cunt! Come on then. Stab me, you cunt. What's this? What's this? You dirty fucking cunt. You dirty fucking cunt. Get off... Get off of me! Fuck off! Fuck off! What? Come again? - Calm down! Calm down! - Fuck off! - Fuck off. - Calm down. on the head, mate. All right. Calm down. Just calm down. All right. Go home. Yeah? We'll talk about it later, yeah? Just go home. Carl, calm down, yeah? We're gonna have the police all over here. Just go home. All right? Fuckin' wankers. Cunts! Did you get my message? Well, I'm here, ain't I? Why didn't you just answer the phone? I had someone around. I didn't hear it ring. You know you got fucking claret all down your face, don't you? Huh? Turn that off. There's a thing in the glove box. Got enough fucking paper clips in here? Yeah, well, I told you, I had someone 'round. There's some tissues in there or something. - Don't know why you bother? - 'Cause I have to. Well, I know you're polo, mate, but you're gonna catch AIDS if you ain't careful. You don't know where those cunts have been. Is she up? No, I don't think so. Look at them fucking noncy bollockses. Sure that cunt's Old Bill. Fucking wanker. Just like the rest of the fucking wankers around there. All fucking turncoats, the lot of them. How many bags you had tonight? You starting to sound like her. Why? You want a bit? No, I'm up early. I've gotta flop on that cunt George. Now I know where he works, gotta pick up the dough. Better fucking have it as well. He's got it. Been driving around in a fucking Saab 900. And if he fucks you bad, just take it off him. Here, do you wanna lose that? Oh, fucking... You ain't... No, I ain't. Listen. I'm gonna go in, all right, before she starts hanging out the fucking window. I'll see you in the morning. What's this? What you doing? I'm putting the washer on. You're taking the piss. Just go to fucking bed. What's that? What? You deaf and blind, you fat fuck? What's that? It's all over your hands? Look, all right, I'll sort it. Just fuck off to bed. Nosey cunt. Fuck off. I'm sick of this shit. I'm bored of your bollocks. For fuck's sake, Carlton. You're disgusting. ...brutal gangland slaying... Discovered in a Range Rover on a farm in Rettendon in Essex... ...when it's expected that the names of those murdered will be released. The victims were 38-year-old Anthony Tucker, 37-year-old Patrick Tate, and 26-year-old Craig Rolfe. It's believed that all three men had gangland connections. Mom! Dad! Dad, there's someone out there, please! Please come and help us! Please. You're fucking sick! I'm not putting up with this shit anymore. You're fucking sick. Come on, girls. I'm taking the girls. We're going to my mum's and if you come fucking near me, I'm gonna call the Old Bill. Do you hear me? Denny, no! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. All right, mate, fucking hell. So he comes in all guns blazing. Drags her out of bed. Did you see the state of her face? - No. No. - Great big black eye. I mean, she was trying to cover it with makeup, but it looks horrendous. She might as well have just left it. And after that, I'll fucking shit on her head. All right, girls. Bloody hell, he's getting big, isn't he, Ton? I'll shit in your mouth. - Been here long? - No, just got here. Oh, fuck off. It's all right, Dad, you can sit down. You all right, Shawn. Well, you better buy her a new one. - All right. - You ordered? No, not yet. You heard from Mum? Yeah, she phoned me this morning. And what did she have to say? She said you're a fucking mug. Oh, really? That's nice, isn't it? Now, shut up. Listen. Look, you know how this works. Oh, fuck off. Have whatever you want. Does your little one want something? Here, you do children's meals, don't you, fellow? He's already had some, thanks. Otherwise, he'll be shitting everywhere. - Are you having something, Dad? - No. No, I'm not hungry. Listen, I'll just have a Jack Daniels and Coke, please, fellow. Lots of ice. You want a drink? Uh, Diet Coke. All right, so that's two Diet Cokes please, fellow, and he'll have a cup of tea. He's owes us! Fuck off! - When you gonna make me a granddad? - Oh, fuck off. - Problem? - Benny wants to know if you're on the phone? I gotta find a nice bloke first. There's loads of nice blokes in Essex. - What's he want? - Saab 900 don't belong to George, belongs to Benny's missus. She's screwing Benny, wants it back today. That's not my problem. That's Benny now. Hello. Calm down. He wants to speak to you. Hello, Benny. All right, listen, don't shout. No. No. Don't... Benny, don't shout. Listen. Listen, that fucking George has been swerving me for the last two weeks. Look, I don't care if it's your wife's motor or Mother fucking Theresa's. I'm owed money, so I've taken it. Look, w... She wants it back today, you're gonna have to front and go and see George for it. That's not my problem. No, li... Take that. He's giving me a fucking headache. What was we saying? Oh, yeah, why can't you get a bloke? Because the very minute they find out who my dad is, they suddenly lose interest. It's funny that, isn't it? No, he fucking owes us. Look, if the money ain't there tonight, right, George is going in the boot and the motor is going in the Thames. Look, can we just have a few more minutes? I don't know what the cunt's problem is. He comes to us, right, with a bit of a fucking woe that can't be sorted out in court, right. We've done the work. I mean, what does he want, a fucking invoice? People at Staines take fucking liberties. And what's George going round in a fucking Benny White anyway, over a poxy three grand fucking debt? I know he's giving me the right fucking hump. Cunt. - What's the time? - Bang on one. So how did we leave it? - Is Benny coming? - No, he's sending his nephew. Good. I can't stand that fucking turd. No, you're all right, I've had some. - Dave? - I'm all right, mate. I thought you turned, uh... your back on us, Dave? Eh? Got a proper job. What's the matter, eh? What, you missed the act, did you? Eh? No. Just got bills to pay. Haven't we all, fellow. Haven't we all. So, come on then, what's happening? You phone him or what? That's what I'm doing. No one's answering. How much would you give me for this motor, Dave? I can't afford it. Well, let's just say that you could. What? Four grand? Five grand? How about six grand? That sound about right to you? Yeah? - Aye, it sounds about right. - Aye. So if I was to offer you this motor right now for about three grand, a mere three grand, you'd say I was being really generous, wouldn't you? Aye. So why the fuck are these cunts not fucking here? Carl, I don't know what he's playing at. I've called him three fucking times. Bollocks! Fuck him. I'm not fucking having this. Who the fuck do they think they are, the fucking Nortons? I don't think they're gonna show. - Fucking wankers. - I don't think they're gonna show. Was I talking to you, shit cunt, eh? Was I talking to him? Just keep your fucking mouth shut, - you fucking wanker. - That's it. Fuck this. I'm off. Oh, really? Go on then. Thats good! Yeah. No. I don't wanna be spoke to like that. Bollocks. - Go on. Off you go. - Dave. Dave, do you wanna lift? Go on. Off you go. Off you go. Yeah. Yeah. Go on. Yeah, that's right. And you, you fucking wankers. Cunt! Fucking... Fucking cunt. Fucking turd. Carlton. Steve, why aren't you answering the fucking phone? I've been calling you fucking six times. Listen, I wanna try and fucking sort out who's in tonight. - I've already done it. - Eh? What do you mean you've already done it? The rota, I've done it myself, Carl. Management stepped in. There's been way too much agg. They're giving me the door now. They've let you go. I'm sorry, mate. What do you mean? What... What... What... What, you've taken over or something? Yeah. Jesus Christ, hang on a fucking minute. You wouldn't even be on the door if it weren't for me. I fucking helped you out when you was on your fucking knees, you cunt! I'm sorry, mate. I'm just obeying orders, yeah. Open this fucking door. Fucking... - Hello? - Hello, Thelma. Is Denny there? Carlton. She's gone out. Hello, mate, you all right? Yeah, listen, come get me. I can't stay in here. I'm gonna go fucking mad. That fucking George is dead. If he thinks he can just mug us off, we've gotta set an example. - Agreed. - Ring up Mad Jack, tell him to go 'round there, douse the cunt in petrol, and set him alight. Yeah, sweet. Have another scotch. I mean, what's he think I am, some sort of cunt? I've been at it longer than all of these lot put the fuck together. And no one, no one throws me a fucking bone. Cunt. Where's my thing? Have you seen my thing? Oy, sweetheart, come over here. It's all right, I've got it. Listen, take my friend with you. He's doing my fucking head in. Oh... Oh, I thought we lost you, Carlton, but you're... you're coming back now. When you boys fall, it is to me that you come. Cocaine-induced hypothermia. A result, I'm afraid, Carlton, of... excess. Is he gonna be all right? Diazepam, yes, it worked, but... not always. No, not always. Oh, better now. Oh, nice. Geezer you're after has jumped out the toilet window. You be quick, you might catch him. Good to see you, mate. How have you been? All right. I've been waiting for you to come and see me after what happened. It's been a long time. I've been busy. He was a good man, Tony. They all were. But they took liberties. You did well to stay out of it. I hope their families get justice. How is yours? Denny's moved out. Carlton. Do you know how many days a soldier can spend in combat before he starts to crack up? Sixty. If they don't pull them out after that, 98 percent of them are ready for the loony bin. What's happened to you, Carlton? - I'm all right. - You're shaking, fellow. You been living on the front line for too long, son, and in our world, no one pulls you out. Can you throw me some work? You'll have to straighten yourself out. People are swerving you, Carl, because you've become unpredictable. They're saying... you're a liability, son. Here you are. Two bags there. Take it. Spend it on coke if you like. Or sort yourself out and get back in the gym. You stepped off the merry-go-round, son. Time you got back on it. When the underworld throws you a lifeline, you take it. I wasn't prepared to die. And I wasn't about to throw the towel in either. Fucking hell, don't know about Pikies, it's like the ICF popped in for a pint. It's all right, fellow, you can put that down. Reg sent us. Mate, tell these cunts to stop banging. Where's Geoff King? We wanna talk to him. He's in the office. Bit shaken up. So is this the first time this has happened or what? Yeah. He's not had the place long. He's a nice fellow, but he hasn't got a clue. You don't say. That's why he brought me in, you know. Someone who knows the game and that. Follow me, gents. Cunt. Want a drink? Yeah, go on. Hey, darling, can I get a couple of Diet Cokes please? Don't worry about the ice. They just kept kicking me. They're like bloody animals. They told this prat it was an anniversary. Who is they? Two girls came in. They said it was their mum and dad's 50th. Did you get their names? Uh, Tina was one. I don't know the other. What, you didn't get their details? Did he fuck? I didn't know that they were Pikies. It couldn't have been more obvious if they'd tried to sell you lucky fucking heather. They always send the women in first. Well, they seemed all right to me. I didn't know that two hours later, there'd be hundreds of them. Yeah. It was a wedding. The women were all at one end, and the men were all stood at the other. Then the kids starting letting off the fire extinguishers. Yeah. It was a wedding. I've been to a couple. They were pulling their own pints. I tried to speak to them. They just went berserk. Where was your door staff while all this was happening? Being knocked unconscious. Two of them are now in hospital. What did the Old Bill say? They said once they find a place they like, they keep coming back. Yeah, they will. I can't go through this again. I'll see what I can do. Excuse us. What you thinking? I think it's a lot of vag. It's a shithole. It's a big shithole though. I'd knock that through. Turn the whole place into one big club. What do you think of him? He's a mug. He's obviously got a lot of Dorises working for him. It's all right. Fuck them off. Bring in our own lumps. We can sort out this agg and take over the whole lot. He owns the freehold... and we own him. I think we should swerve it. I mean, I fucking hate clubs, and you're gonna get right back on the sniff. I collect debts, I don't run fucking doors, do I? Plus, it's gonna take a load of our fucking time and... what about the work? Jesus, I'm not asking you to give up kidnapping and torturing people. All I'm saying is if we set this up properly, it'll take care of itself. Mate, I'm on my fucking knees here, help me out. Just trying to get my family back. Listen, we could sort out the bits and pieces. We can make fucking bundles here, I'm telling you. Fucking bundles. Nah, that's what Pat and Tony thought. Yeah, but things are different now, aren't they? Are they? I bet there's no food in the house. If it is, it's probably gone off. There's milk in the fridge. And who's doing your washing? Me. Who do you think is bloody doing it? Bet you've taken it down to the laundrette. Listen. I might not be the greatest dad in the world, but I know how to wash my own bloody shorts, girl. - Do you want me to come over? - No! I'm all right. You seen the posters, my new club? No, you haven't got a club. Yes, I have. Tell Denny when you see her, all right, that I'm gonna be kayko again soon. Tell her I'm gonna be dripping with dough, all right. Tell her that. And don't forget it's Jody's birthday next week. When? You're bloody outrageous, Dad. I know when she was born. I just don't know what day it is next week. - It's next Sunday. - All right. Well... I'll get her something nice. Listen. I know it's opening night and everyone's a bit excited, but one of your doormen's out there, waving about what looks like a cattle prod. Yeah, that's Mad Jack. I'll tell him to put it away. Hello, darling. So is your Nan making you a birthday cake? You gonna save me some? No. Of course I have. Are you gonna bring it to Nana's house? Yeah. Well, I'll have to speak to your mum first. Jaime, give me the phone back. I'll tell Mum. Mum! Mum! Mum! What did you say to her? I didn't say nothing to her. Thanks for that. I've gotta try and get her to bed now. So what's happening about tomorrow? I don't know, all right. I've got two kids screaming the house down and I'm at my Mum's. I don't know anything. Fucking cunt! - Hello, mate, you all right? - Mate, you better get down here, the fucking gypos have turned up. We're outnumbered. Go. Go. Go. Go. You Cunt! Move! Fucking cunt! Aah! Mad Jack, get him off me! Die, you cunt! Die, you gypsy cunt! Die, you fucking gypsy cunt! Oy! What the fuck? Now, Tony, shake his fucking hand, you silly cunts. - Jon Jon. - Carlton. Long time no see. What you doing down here? I come down for a wedding. I thought I'd stay here, mate. I wanna apologize for the action of these young men. Okay. They can't hold their beer. - This is my son. My youngest. - Hello, mate. - You all right? - Steve. How you doing? You all right? Good to see you. Listen, guys, do you wanna pop in for a drink? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, that'd be good. - Yeah, nice one. Thank you very much. - Come on. Hey, love, can you take these gentlemen up to the VIP for me please. Cheers, darling. Yeah. No, I'm fine. Are you mad? Listen, that geezer over there is a very good pal of mine, all right. He also happens to be one of the best bare-knuckle fighters in the country. So fucking look after him. See. Ain't so bad after all. Fucking love you, mate. I fucking love you. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. Don't worry, he doesn't bite as hard as me. You wanna see the state of your neck? It looks like you've been mauled. Thanks. I would say I'm sorry, but I'm not. So what's my name? Don't know. Well, that's fucking great, isn't it? - Lorraine? - No. Come on, Woody. I'm gonna bring you down for a pee. Would you like a cup of tea, Carlton? For fuck's sake. You have one new message. First message. Hello, Dad, Nana got me a new birthday dress. Please come to my party. Cheers, Lucy. - So what's she gonna say? - Who? Your wife when you go home? Nothing. So how long have you been together? What's it got to do with you? Last night, you were pilled up asking if you could stay here while you were getting your shit together. And what, I can't ask you a question now? Look, if you think you're the only villain that I've fucked in this bed, you're even more stupid than your wife for putting up with your shit. - Mouthy, ain't you! - I'm not actually. Because if I was, I'd probably be dead by now. Don't worry, I know when to keep my mouth shut. Who's the lump in the photo? What's that got to do with you? Nothing. - Hello, Thelma. - What do you want? Ain't you fucking dead yet? What is it now, Carlton? I just wanna come 'round and wish my daughter happy birthday, if it's all right? Look at the state of you. Yeah, well, we had a bit of agg at the club last night. I'm not interested. You coming in or what? Dad. Yeah. Happy birthday, darling. Aww! All right. All right, don't drop him. What do you say to your dad? Thank you. Yeah. Do I get a kiss? There you go. All right. That'll be pissing everywhere. You know my mum hates dogs. You gonna take your coat off or what? No. No, I've gotta go. I've got a bit of work on. Of course you have. He's my pup. Look, I want you and the kids to come back home. I told you, Carl, I'm not doing it. Yeah, well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about, you know. It's just... What? Look, can't we just go inside? It's hardly a fucking secret. All right. Well, I'm moving out. I don't think it's fair that you and the girls are cooped up 'round here, you know. Where are you going? I'll probably stay with a friend. Right. Right. Well, thanks for stopping by, yeah. Take this. Thanks. Abass, you remember Carlton? He used to be a very close friend of the family's. Before the troubles. No. You're too young. How's the rest of the family? Busy as always. That's good to hear. Are you sure you don't want a drink? No, no, no, no. He's a good boy. Bit like his father. So you still like to gamble? You know win some, lose some. What about lately? Lose some. How much? Two trucks. One has been stripped. Gone. The other one's sitting in a barn somewhere in Kent. Done by the same people. Yeah, it's been happening a lot recently. That's a little bit naughty to hijack a truck that's already been stolen. Well, we live in dark times, my friend. Booze or fags? Vodka. Courtesy of France. What about the driver? He put up a fight, but they stabbed him. We think he's dead. The other guy got away. Lucky. Because that's why we know where the truck is. We need someone to reclaim it. What do you think? I think we should go and get it. I was humping the missus last night and after about six minutes, I shoot my load, roll over, spark up. She starts going all fucking Garrity, "Ain't you gonna finish me off, you selfish bastard?" So I smothered her. - You are joking? - Nah. - Did you have to bring him? - What? Oh, it's all right. She's still alive, the fat bitch. Listen, you shut your fucking mouth and stay away from me. Don't be giving me no fucking orders, sweaty. You ain't in the army now. What the fuck you doing here anyway? I'm here to drive your fucking wagon. I forgot you two fancy each other. Oh, Felix, just ignore him. Listen, I don't like idiots, Carlton. Idiots get you fucking killed. Okay, action man, how about I ram this down your fucking throat? I'll drop you in a fucking heartbeat, cunt. Oh, come on, you two, cut the bollocks. Calm down. Cunt. All right. Let's go. Hey! Get on the fucking floor! Get on the fucking floor now! Get down now! Fucking prick! Where's the fucking keys? Speak English, you fucking cunt? Where's the fucking keys to the truck? Carlton! Fucking jackpot, mate. Go switch the plates over. All right, mate. Nobody fucking move! Get down, you cunts! What the fuck is that? Oh, man, is that the driver? What the fuck we gonna do with this? We'll get him up. He's coming with us. How's that driver getting on? He won't be working for us again, but he'll live. Nice work, Carlton. Thank you. Might have another job if you're interested. - I'm listening. - You're gonna need your passports. Go on. How does Tenerife sound? - Lovely. - Well, we have a club out there, and it makes good money. When people pay their taxes, everyone's happy. When certain individuals choose to ignore that... we have a problem. Well, it's simple. If people wanna serve up, then you gotta pay. So we can take care of that for you. Absolutely. Why not. Listen, excuse me for a minute, gents. Do you know Tenerife? Well, to be honest, it's not really my cup of tea, but Carlton's done some work out there with Tony when Nigel Benn was training for a fight. So, you know, why not. Good. Fucking hell, you on Viagra or something? Keep your mouth shut. What if I don't? I'm gonna ram your knickers down your fucking throat, you bitch. Oh, fuck me, you bastard, fuck me. Oh! Oh, man, look at that. Gorgeous. Women, eh? Boob jobs. Nose jobs. Teeth bleaching. Tummy tucks. Liposuction. Colonic irrigation. Botox. Pierced ears, nipples, belly buttons, anklets. Eyebrows plucked. Bikinis waxed. Arm pits shaved. Lips tattooed. Diets. Exercise. But they won't take it in the fucking arse. 'Cause that hurts. - You're a sick cunt. - Yeah. Is that fucking Tom Cruise? Brixton Belly. How you doing, fella, you all right? - Ah, how's it going? - Good to see you. Stan. Fucking hell, what's happened to you? You're like a fucking lizard. It's hot out here. Pissing it down at home, is it? Yeah. You're not wrong. Shawn, this is Stan. This is Bob. Take a seat, gents. Here, darling, can I get a couple of Long Island Ice Teas for these two, and we'll just get a couple of Cokes, - lots of ice. - You not drinking? Nah, not just yet. Me and Bob go way back, don't we, fellow, eh? - Yeah, man. - Yeah. And this geezer, we used to work the door at the Ministry of Sound, isn't it? That's it. Yeah, them were the days, mate, remember. Remember when fucking Big Lenny tried to come and take the door off us. Fucking hell. I thought I was gonna have to shoot the cunt. I was hardly gonna roll around on the cobbles with an 80-stone monster, you know what I mean? Fuck that. Tell you what, you're gonna love this Demikran's place. - It's right next to the club. - And I've got the fucking greatest on this fucking island, Rocket Fuel. I bet you have. This gear is ridiculous. I love the smell of it. I'm telling you. It makes the girls go mental. This wanker's big sister used to stash cocaine in the used underwear basket, so technically, his drug addiction is her fault. Yeah. You're probably right. Hi, this is Denny. Leave me a message. They're sniffing their heads off in there. You get hold of her? She's not answering her phone. Me and Tony had such a laugh out here. We were side by side. We just knew we had each other's back. We was untouchable. It should have stayed like that. Wasn't your fault, mate. I let people down, Shawn. That's what I do. I walked out on my son. And now I'm doing exactly the same with Denny and the kids. I'm gonna lose them, Shawn. No, you'll sort it, mate. You reckon? Yeah, 'course. I can't end up like Tony. You know I'm always gonna be there for you, don't you? Yeah, I know, mate. Come on. Let's go and see if that mad cunt's had a heart attack. How is things going with Mickey Steele and Jack? They're still waiting their trial, aren't they? Do you think they did it? Doesn't matter what I think. It ain't gonna bring Tony back. What if they didn't do it? Then whoever did is still walking about. That's why I ain't coming back, bruv. The Ends is a shithole. You could get popped by anyone. If the Yardies ain't trying to fucking burst you, the Nortons will. I'm telling you, I'm not going back to Essex until it fucking calms down with bass. Well, you'll be waiting a long time then, won't you? Essex will never calm down. There's too many people at it. Which is fine. As long as you don't take the piss. - It's good to see you, big fellow. - You too, man. Right. Well, we better go and check on the door. Lads, soon as you're ready, come down. We'll look after you. I reckon that's them. Yeah, mate, you're right. Boys. It's cunt o'clock. Let's go. Evening, gents. Who you paying rent to? Who the fuck are you? My name's Carlton Leach. Now answer the question. We pay the club. You see the thing is, the owner of this club is a very good friend of mine. And he begs to differ. Come with me. It's all right, I ain't gonna hurt you. Just wanna talk business. These men belong to us. But they got greedy. From now on, you pay Demikran direct. Do you understand? Oy-oy. - You all right? - What you up to? Not much. Denny said you were in Tenerife. Yeah. Me and Shawn had a bit of work out there. Oh, well, me and the girls are thinking about going. Let me know when you wanna go 'cause my mate's got an apartment out there. - You could stay there for nothing. - Oh, wicked. Thanks, Dad. It's all right. Who's that? It's my new man. Oh, behave. He's about 12, ain't he? Shut up. What's he doing standing over there? Well... he's Millwall, ain't he? You're fucking joking me, ain't you? 'Course he ain't. Nick. What you standing over there for? You can come over, you know. Look, I just wanna say I think you're a legend. Oh, my God. How muggy is that? Right, come on. We're going. Um, Dad, don't forget to speak to Denny 'cause she misses you, all right. Yeah, all right. We don't have that sort of money. We just have a small cash and carry business. Well, they obviously think you do. We don't have a hundred thousand pounds. Sit down, fellow, you're giving me indigestion. Father, please, sit down. These men are gonna help. I'm not so sure about that, fellow. Who are these people? - I don't know. - His name's Matthew Taylor. - Matthew Taylor, who the fuck is that? Do you know? - No. Great, so you want me to look through the Yellow Pages. If we don't give him a 100K by Wednesday... Yeah, he's gonna burn the warehouse down. I've got that bit. Look. They're just a couple of mugs, ain't they, trying it on. Are you sure about that? Well, what do you think? I don't know, this came through you, didn't it? All right. Forty grand. We can't pay that. Then it's gonna cost you ten grand for fucking us about. Can we get some more poppadoms please? So where's the fucking money then, you smelly cunt? It's all there? There is no money. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm looking after these fellows' best interests. And what do you know about that? Me? I do this for a living, son. Really? Because from what I hear, you're finished. You lost it. Game's moved on, old man. You see this. This don't concern you. So why don't you take your little firm and fuck off. If you're not careful, I can see you ending up like your old friend, Tony Tucker. Who the fuck were they? - Did you know them? - No. Yeah, well, they're hardly fucking no one, are they? - Getting sloppy. - Oh, fuck off. You're getting fucking sloppy. What's the matter, you're fucking... You do your fucking homework. Do your fucking homework. Look. Let's get the fuck out of here. Cunt. If you're not careful, I can see you ending up like your old friend, Tony Tucker. You're disgusting. Watch the road, girls. Watch the roads. Hello, girls, you all right? Yeah. Can you give us a lift, Dad? No. I've got to go to work, babe. I can't be bothered to walk. Honey, I'm sorry, I've got work on. Sorry. What you doing here? I just come to see how you are. We're fine. You look fucked. Well, it's been a long night, hasn't it? That's all. Suggest you go to bed then. Come on, girls. Let's go to school. - No, we wanna see Dad. - Now! I haven't seen him in ages. I'm tired. I can't walk. Done well to turn this place 'round. I hardly recognize it. Where's Shawn? Given him the night off? No. He's doing his own thing. You two make a strong team. Yeah. We do all right. People are aware of that. Good. I don't want people thinking I'm finished. I see Denny's moved back in. That's good, isn't it? How did you know that? I seen her and the girls coming out of the house the other morning when I drove past. That's good that they moved back in with you. - I'm not there. - Oh. Sorry. Thought you was. No. Well, maybe you should think about it. You might be leaving yourself open, Carlton. I will. Just been busy, that's all. Try not to take on too much, yeah. Then things won't get so complicated. Reg, has someone been saying something? No. Just don't go too fast, that's all. Slow down a bit. Don't you worry about me. I'm not. Listen. If someone's been shooting their mouth off, it's probably just some coked-up plastic wannabe, all right? I ain't gonna lose no sleep over it. You want a drink? Oh, I'm sick of people groping my arse all bloody night. Get paid, don't you? It's hard work walking around in high heels and having to deal with coked-up perverts all night. Don't know what the fucking problem is. You're drunk. Give me the keys. Let me drive. Come on. I don't wanna fight with you, Carlton. Just give me the fucking keys. She's really beautiful. I don't know why you're fucking her around. Has no one told you, I'm a cunt. At least you're honest about it. What's this cunt doing? What? Why are you going the wrong way? Get down. - Get down. - What? Get down! What's going on? Oh, my God, what's going on? Just bring me home. Just bring me home now. We gotta keep active. I ain't slowing down for no one. That's why we're gonna do him. His name is Kenny Davis. He was sent out to Spain to pick up seventy grand. And he forgot to come back. People have been after this slippery cunt for ages. Well, then it'll make us look good. He's hiding out in Portugal. We're gonna find him. How is it I know this geezer? He's that bald-headed mug who used to work on the door at Kudos. You know the geezer, the one who was always letting in the fucking 16-year-olds. That's right. You were in his fucking house that time to pick up them. The geezer who had a load of teenagers sitting around blowing bubbles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a fucking nonce. Be a pleasure to carve that cunt up. I'm gonna put the kettle on. - Is there any beers left? - No. As long as we're a hundred percent sure he's out there. No. I'm just gonna send us all on a wild fucking goose chase. Of course I'm fucking sure. I know where he is. He's in Villa Morta. Villa Morta? Seventy grand with all those dirty bastards. Be none of it left. Lucy, is there a bin? Yeah, it's over beside the fridge. Will you get me the milk out when you're down there? Would you like a cup? Yeah, go on. So is this guy really a nonce? Who? The guy you're going out to find? I don't know. I don't care. I treat them all the same. I... I just don't know how you do it. I mean, I couldn't hurt anyone. I mean, what if you kill him? - I won't. - How do you know? I just do. Do you remember buying your first record? Yeah it was, um, Donna Summers' I Feel Love. And do you remember when you were on the way home, you were so excited, because you couldn't wait to listen to it? Yeah. And then the minute you get home... you get it out the sleeve, you put it on the deck... and you put the needle down softly. And then you're standing there... and you hold your breath. And you wait for the music to begin. And then it plays. You want Donna Summer to sing forever. That's the way I feel when I have someone over. If I killed them, then it'd spoil it. I don't want any sugar in my tea, by the way. Remind me to pick up a bottle of Chanel for her indoors. You're a fucking mug. Get mine a bar of Toblerone and she's well happy. I mean, I'm not saying she's fat or anything, but I got on top of her the other night, and my fucking ears popped. Hello. Carlton, where are you? Why? There's some geezer parked up outside. He's been there all morning. Eh? Who is he? What car is he driving? It's a silver Golf. Look, I've never seen him before. I don't know what he wants. - Where are you? - I'm at the airport. I don't like this, all right. He's creeping me out. He's staring straight at me. Carlton, I want you to come home now. - Sort this out. - All right. All right. All right. All right, I'll come back, all right. - Now. - Right, just lock the windows... Lock the windows, lock the doors, and I'll come back, all right. For fuck's sake. Are you all right? All right, girls. Carlton, it's him. It's him. Take the girls upstairs. Now. Come on. Girls, go upstairs with your mum. Just go upstairs with your mum. Do as she says. Are you Carlton Leach? Yeah. And who the fuck are you? I'm really sorry if I've caught you at a bad time, but... I think you're my dad. Matt. You better come in. Carlton? Matt, this is my wife, Denny. This is my son. This is Matt? Hello, mate. What's his name? Sam. That's a good name. What's yours? Jaime. - That's a nice name too. - Thank you. - There you go, love. - Thanks. Jody, are you not gonna say hello to Matt? Who are you? He's your Daddy's son. Matt's your brother. Don't have a brother. You do, Babes. Where have you been? I've been on holiday. Was there lots of sunshine? Yeah. You ain't got a tan. Do you like boxing? Yeah. I watched that fight on the telly. It was brutal. But he's a legend, Nigel Benn. I was there that night. Yeah. Me and my mate Tony walked him out. Maybe I saw you. Yeah, well, you can hardly fucking miss me. I was about two and a half stone heavier then. Was you in the ring at the end when it all kicked off? Yeah. Yeah, me and Tony both were. I tell you, it was fucking mental. It was just chaos, mate. Fucking fists flying everywhere. - Who's Tony? - He was my best mate. Yeah, he died last year. Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry to hear that. It's all right. You support West Ham? Yeah. Just a bit. When they let me in. So how about you then? You from Watford? Do you get down Vicarage Road? No. I'm a Spurs fan. Fucking front wheel skid. My son, a fucking dustbin lid. Oh, mate, that's me being punished that is. Give him a break. You'll stay for dinner, won't you, Matt? Sorry about that. Just had to phone work. What do you do exactly? Security, mainly. What do you do for work, Matt? I'm a gym instructor. Oh, yeah? Carlton's into all that. Yeah. Can't get into it myself. I've got too much to do getting these buggers to school in the morning. My wife says the same. You want another beer? I can't, I'm driving. Well, just stay. We've got a thing in the other room, just put it down. Yeah, it'd be lovely. Why don't you stay? Well, if you're sure. Well, you don't wanna go all the way back to fucking Watford tonight, do you? It's miles away. Oh that... Yeah, that-that'd be nice. Thanks. Are you two really sisters? Yeah. Who's the oldest? Guess. What do you reckon, Mad Jack? Couldn't give a flying fuck. Who's the filthiest? - Do you two come together? - Yeah. Oh, I bet you fucking do. Get rid of them. Well, it's been a pleasure dribbling over you girls. Now fuck off. Whoa, whoa, girls, girls, look, I'm sorry. Look, I'll see you in the club later or something, yeah? Carlton's not coming out anymore. He's got some family stuff he needs to take care of. He wants us to flop on that greedy cunt tonight in case he slips off. Found a towel for you. Got a toothbrush. Thanks. Listen, Matt... son... there's a few things you don't know about me right now. And I mean we can talk about it any time, that's no problem. It's just... Go and wait in the car. The kind of work I do... ...it's probably best to separate it from you. Of course. I understand. Thank you. Listen... have... have a good night's sleep, yeah. I'll see you in the morning. Sorry about everything. Don't be. Goodnight. Goodnight, son. Carlton. Come here. Fucking hell. All right, darling. How you doing? - How you going, babe, all right. - Oh, whoa. Easy. Easy. Easy. Mate, all right. Fucking hell. Hey, girls, you want a drink? Two of them for me please. Hey, I want a drink. I'm sorry, mate. Fucking hell. I don't think much of your one. How much is he charging? You call me a gay, you fucking English prick. Hello, baby, you all right? Oh, look at those sweet little puppies. You gonna take them both, you greedy cunt? Don't know, I might do. Where is your mates? Your sisters, where are they? Go and get them? They are fucking sisters. I'll see you in about five. Oy-oy! Let's have a night! Fuck! Morning. Oh, morning, you all right? Did you sleep well? Yeah. Very well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's comfortable, that sofa bed. I've had a sleep on there a few times. You don't have sugar, do you? No, thanks. - Morning, love. - Morning. Morning, you all right? Hello, mate, you all right? When was this? And what about Shawn? Fuck's sake, you got a pen that works? Have you got a fucking pen? Quick. For fuck's sake. Yeah, go on, mate. Yeah. All right. Stay there, I'm coming out. - Carlton? - That toast is burning. Hello, mate. Yeah, get your stuff together, all right. I've got a job for you. Yeah. Right, I'll be 'round in a bit. I can't stay. I've gotta go the airport. - What's happened? - Look, I can't talk now. Right. I'll phone you when I get there. - Do you want a lift? - No. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm sorry, Carlton. - Where is he? - He's in there. The Old Bill have been asking questions. Who did this? I don't know. There was too many of them. They came out of nowhere. I came out, I saw Mad Jack getting attacked, I tried to help him. I hit the floor and covered up and... Shawn, he... he tried to stand and fight. They just kept stabbing him. This is serious, Carlton. Paramedics said he died twice on the way here. - Have you found these cunts? - Carlton, no one's seen them yet, all right. Now, I've spoken to everyone, and I've turned the place upside down. Mate, they've probably slipped off and they're out of the fucking country. Fuck's sake. This is my fault. I should have been here. I fucking did it again. I fucking walked away. I tell you something, Felix, if he dies, I am fucked. - Will you get a fucking grip. - For fuck's sake. Now I know you want retribution. I know you want retribution, but you need to let it go, Carlton, because it will fucking destroy you. When I was in the regiment, I lost guys, Belfast, Ahmar, never saw the perpetrator's face, and I had to deal with that. And you have to deal with it. And you need to focus on Shawn. Focus on Shawn. You need to get a fucking grip, Carlton. At last I found my son. But almost lost another friend to this violence that surrounds me. To survive in this world, you have to be prepared to fight until your lungs fill with blood. I just don't know if I still have that in me. How can I introduce Matt into this? How can I expect my son to bury the father he never knew. I need to walk away while I still can. I can't believe the nutter just checked himself out after five days. Yeah, well, he ain't keen on hospitals. Soon as his lungs started working, he was up and he was out. Well, what's he like now? His back looks like a human knife rack. But he'll be all right. Do you think the police will find them? No. No chance. Can tell you two are brother and sister. Half. All right then, half. Both got his nose. Well, I'd rather that than his mouth. That's charming, isn't it? So, are you two back together now then or what? Carlton! Good evening. So how's the food? I was just saying, isn't it, It's really, really nice. Thanks for inviting us, mate. - I appreciate it. - Well, it's my pleasure. It's good to see you, Denny. Looking as beautiful as ever. - He's a lucky man. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God, Carly. Carly. Carly. She looks like such an independent woman all of a sudden. Well, I wouldn't go that far. She still knows how to hold her hand out, don't you? - Can you spare your husband? - You can have him. There was a reason I invited you here tonight. And it wasn't to buy you dinner. I... You know, us Turks like to keep things amicable when it comes to business. And in my country, we say, "A thousand friends are too few, and one enemy... is too many." So go on then. Who have you upset? Not me, my friend. You. I'm gonna be straight with you, Carlton. You've upset a family. And they've put a contract out on you. Which family? - The Nortons? - Yeah. Why? I tried to vouch for you, Carlton. I'm sorry. So what you gonna do? Set up a meet. Tell them I'll go alone, yeah. Uh-huh. You'd do that for me? 'Course I will. 'Course I will. Okay. Are you all right? Yeah. Fine. From the outside, it can seem like a lawless lifestyle. but a criminal society's no different from any other. There's an infrastructure in place. A hierarchy you have to respect. The Nortons are the governors. If they have a problem with me, I'm fucked. But it's not in my nature to run. The only way to protect my family is to accept what's coming. How the fuck did you get up here? - Stairs. - What, on your own? You're unbelievable. You're supposed to be resting. You're gonna end up breaking your fucking neck. Yeah, well, the DJ is getting on my nerves. Why didn't you answer your phone? Well, come on then, your message sounded urgent, what is it? Nothing. Just thought I'd see if you was all right, that's all. Well, why didn't you ask me that on the phone? Well, pick up the phone next time, maybe I will. You know when you died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital... do you remember it? No. They say that you do. No, don't remember nothing. - Well, maybe that's it, mate. - What's that? Nothing. That's it. That's your lot. Well, you know, if you think there's gonna be any pearly gates for us, it ain't gonna happen, mate. - You made a will? - No. No, I'm not leaving nothing behind. Well, what about Cayna? Well, you know, she's... she's with her mother and her family, so she's well looked after, so don't worry about it. You ever think about knocking it all on the head and just going back out there, you know, to be with her? Yeah, all the time. But she's better off in Thailand. Anyway, who'd look after you? I've been putting some dough away for my kids. Yeah? What's that? That's the number for a safety deposit box. There's not a massive amount in there, but... it'll sort my kids out for a bit when I'm gone. - You all right? - Yeah. Just been doing a bit of thinking, that's all. Will you look after that for me? Yeah, of course, mate. Cheers. - Good morning, girls. - Dad! You look smart, don't you, hey. Yeah. What you doing here? Thought I'd come and say hello. Is that all right? Now you're not gonna drive Mrs. Feather up the wall today, are you? - No. - Good. All right. Well, I'll see you in a bit, yeah? - Be good, darling. - Mm-hmm. And you, trouble. You're here. Good. I'm afraid my brothers won't be joining us this evening, but they do send their regards. You got me instead, the runt of the litter. Please take a seat. Do you like scotch? - Yeah. - So do I. And would you believe it, so does half of Asia too. In fact, the last time I had a little drop of this stuff... I was at the Ritz Carlton in Bangkok, Carlton. Funny that. Cheers. Essex boy, eh? Except you're not, are you? You're East End. See... the problem with the lot of them over that way is they seem to take South End literally. I mean, it doesn't. It carries on. Paris, Geneva, Monaco, Milan. That's why my brothers like you, Carlton, because you understand that. So... when someone comes to us asking for you to be taken care of, my brothers and I find it somewhat... disturbing. Who is it? Well, if you'd taken the time to ask yourself that exact question in the first place, and indeed gone about your work in a more professional way, we wouldn't have this problem. Instead... you blinded someone who belongs to someone who belongs to us. Your complacency has left the family feeling... uncomfortable. I didn't know. - Didn't know... - They... Well, you fucking do now! A fine single malt... is like a complicated woman. Needs to be taken seriously. The kid had no respect. He had no regard for the death of my good pal Tony Tucker. If I saw him again, I'd take his other eye out. That's why we're fond of you, Carlton. But you need to show some control over the anger you have inside. Because violence, my dear, will only take you so far in this world. Contract's been taken out. It can't just be lifted. Something needs to be done. Done for us. You understand? Listen, if you need something taken care of, I can sort it. We already know you're a leader of men, Carlton. But what happens when you look around and there's no ICF... no firm, no army. Just you, alone... with that fear... and self-doubt... that keeps you awake at night. I don't need anyone. Good. Because you're going to Rotterdam tonight, alone. You will deliver something to a very dangerous and volatile individual called Lars Becker, who has been a little bit trigger happy recently for our liking. Be there tomorrow night at 10 p.m. Someone will meet you. Prove you have some control over the demons you have inside and maybe... the little problem you've got will go away. One other thing. It isn't a good idea to be there when he opens it. Or you won't be coming back. I always thought that Tony was tricked into death. But maybe like me, he just didn't have a choice. But I will die with dignity. Where are we going? You'll see. Get out. At last we meet. The ICF general and West Ham's top boy. It's a shame we didn't come face to face on the Terraces. FC Feyenoord welcomes you to Rotterdam, Carlton. Tell me, how is the Yid Army these days? Same as Ajax. Bunch of cunts. I believe you've got something for me. We've walked the same path, you and I, from the dogs to the Terraces and now we found each other at the top table. No, this is it. No more. I'm getting out. I've fulfilled my obligation. Now can you get one of these lads to drop me back at the port? You'll be walking away from a lot of money, Carlton. The Nortons now have businesses in Thailand, Cambodia. They need people like you and me to take control over there. No, my family is more important. It's a young man's game. I'm walking away. Retirement is a fantasy, Carlton. You've chosen this life, and now it's chosen you. When you look into the eyes of these men, you'll see that they've accepted it too. We're all on borrowed time, Carlton. But they enjoy fear because they understand it. Ah. I've lost too many friends. I can't do this. It's over. Take him to the port. Come on. Don't open it! You think you saved my life. But in fact... you saved your own. Welcome to the family, Carlton. You all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah... - Hello, mate, you all right? - Hi, bruv. - You ain't going, are you? - I'm going nowhere mate. See you soon, yeah. Oh! Arsene, you ginger cunt! Pass the fucking ball! Fucking mug! So where's Cambodia then? Near Thailand, you prick. Yeah? All those dirty fucking lady boys, you would know, wouldn't you, you sweaty. Fuck you. Prick. So when we going? We're not. I was just explaining to the boys about our plans. Talking of which, where's your boy today? I didn't know you had a son? Oh sorry. My mistake. He's probably at a Spurs game. When you've got family, it makes you vulnerable. Lars was right. I've chosen this life, now it's chosen me. And the merry-go-round just turns and turns. The only way I'm going to leave this life is when someone comes along and takes it.
