MADNESS Script Viktor Lorents Set designer Kaljo Kiisk Main camera operator Anatoli Zabolotski Design and costumes Halja Klaar Music Lembit Veevo It happened in a small village, where the invaders had already succeeded in executing all Jews, Marxists, gypsies, guerillas. Now it was the turn of those mentally ill. Squad, halt! Right turn! From the shoulder! Stand free! Open the gate! Long live our liberators! Hurray! Hurray! Shut your mouth! Squad, halt! Right turn! Long live our liberators! Hurray! Hurray! Dear friends! Today we will all go for a walk in the woods. The grass is beautiful, there are tall trees. berries and mushrooms, ferns... We'll take a little walk, shall we? And this is the one? - Yes, this is the asylum. This is the one! Today we are admitting nobody. We have a commission today. What commission? Let the gentleman in, once he's come himself! Quiet! Quiet! Without fighting! Does it matter, who goes first? I have seen you somewhere, I surely have. But where? Heinz! Doctor, I'll scream! I'll scream! Then you will be just like all other patients. I'll throw this... From these windows quite a few things have been thrown out. I'll kill at least one of them. - Well, well! Oh, pardon! I do apologise. I knocked twice, but... Are you the chief doctor? I see! You have a beautiful little town here! Did you want to see me? - I'd be very grateful to you... in case I'm not disturbing? Please. - Thank you! I was in a hurry. I feared most to be late. Windisch. Sturmbannf?hrer Windisch. - Yes, yes, please. Lucia! Prepare clothes for him! It's not necessary. In this case you have an absolutely normal person. Sturmbannf?hrer August Windisch. From Gestapo. Special task. Please! Not necessary. Excuse me. Excuse me. Dear doctor, let's start, shall we? - Yes, please. Doctor, tell me, how many patients do you have in the hospital now? 583. 583. It's not awfully lot, but also not too few. Among these 583 patients an English spy is hiding himself. We must catch him alive. Doctor, shouldn't we close the window? It disturbs our talk. - Yes. Doctor, I think it would be best to introduce me as a regular new doctor. As you wish. Maybe you need my office? Oh, no. By no means. You will introduce me as a regular ward doctor. And please do not forget it for a second. Oh! I can't imagine who that could be. I've personally checked the patients' diagnoses. And then there is the medical council. Simply unbelievable! Doctor, I hope I'm not wrong, assuming that in you I have found a very good assistant and a very diligent consultant. Is this an order? Order or not an order, we are both bound to a certain degree by a joint professional secret. Do you agree? - And then? Oh. Then? If I make progress, so do you and vice versa. Let's go! - Let's go. Doctor, if I fail in carrying out the task, it will also affect you. Do you understand? In psychiatry I am a beginner. Until 1933 I generally worked as a teacher. Gentlemen, I'm ripe. Your subject? Physical exercise. I'll go and look at the patients. Hello! - Hello! How do you do! Well! So! I'll start treating you with a completely new method. Maybe there are some among you, who do not need treatment? I have seen you somewhere... for sure. But where? I have seen you somewhere. Quite certain. But where? Doctor, why did they send us a new doctor? Maybe everything will still go all right? I don't know! I don't know anything and I don't want to know. Work must be done as usual. I will go to the wards with the doctor. Very interesting! Quite a few collectors would envy you for this collection. Please choose, and remember that besides an illness, every patient has a character and world outlook, their own thoughts and spirit. Doctor, do you think they shouldn't be destroyed? I don't know how frank can I be with you. - You already told me all. I would like to take this one, a very original solution. It's drawn by a person who is never going to leave this hospital. Tell me, doctor, why do you like treating the completely hopeless? First of all, they are human beings just like us and secondly, we don?t know how we will end up. Humour? So, from 583 patients, these have remained under investigation. If it's not a secret - on what grounds... - Excuse me, I didn't interrupt you. Forgive me. - These three will remain under investigation. How old are you? - 48. How long is your medical practice? - 23. Tell me, during these 23 years, haven't you had to unmask even a single patient? Of course. It has happened and sometimes even... Who is the person No. 1? Doesn't it seem odd to you as chief doctor that a patient is hiding himself in a hospital under a mere number? I don't understand you. - You do. I'm not here to listen to a sane person playing a fool. I'm interested in his name. - He was brought here without papers. Wonderful. Why, don't you find it odd that a person finds shelter in a hospital without papers? How? Did you inform anybody? No. - No? Well... er... Strange. Let's continue - Yuri Krohn? What kind of a man is he? I brought him here. I was on duty at that time. - I know, I read. You brought him from a ghetto? Is he a Jew? No! The ghetto inhabitants told us themselves that a crazy Aryan was among them. Wonderful inhabitants of ghetto! Philanthropists, yes? Tell me, is it thinkable that the English secret service would send its own people to a ghetto? Well, it is thinkable. Yes, then there's the third person. Diagnosis ? traumatic stress. Well, there are all kinds of traumatics. By the way, all three will be here soon. Are they here? - Yes, shall I call them? Yes, please. Send them in. Gentlemen! Please take your seats! I'm here. We may begin... I am listening. Person No. 1, without papers. First name, surname, date of birth. How long have you been connected with the English secret service? A-ha! The last question is the most important... Since 1933... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven - eleven years! More precisely! Already eleven years I spit on the English secret service. Doctor, why doesn't this dude stand up when the leader is talking to him! Who is in command here? Let yourself be informed that you will already be hanged. Why hang me, I've got nothing to do with arson. What are you talking about - setting fire to the Reichstag? I'm talking about an elevator. The Reichstag has nothing to do with it, it was set to fire by communists. Inform them that the elevator was also set to fire by communists. We have a report and the signatures of witnesses confirming that namely you set fire to the elevator. Here! And by the law... - I make the law. They are meant for the people who are a bunch of scum. The nation is not able to understand the laws. It just has to obey them. And anyway a law is a very wide meaning. Give him more of my books to read. And let him learn by heart the collection of my quotations. Every word in there is law! You are absolutely right. - But of course. Very, very true. I know, I'm always right. Even when I'm wrong, I'm always right. My leader, shouldn't you to go to your ward to rest? Don't give me orders! I haven't forgotten that I have an important meeting tonight. With whom? Hunters. It's none of your business. Don't poke your nose In other people?s business! Gentlemen, you are dismissed! So, what's your complaint? The same old. Listen, it's our first meeting. This answer doesn't tell me anything! Tell me, is he also a doctor? - Yes, relax, relax, Yuri. I'm worried that I can't return to the ghetto. Ghetto? You are a pure-blood Aryan, what are ghettos and Jews to you? Tell the doctor, tell him. My house is near there. I saw everything, I took them cabbage, I didn?t have anything else, but then I ran out of cabbage. I went anyway. I read poems to them, they liked it very much. Two women even cried and wanted to kiss my hand. You find that nation likeable? I'm not interested in nationality. The principle is important. - Which principle? The same one. - Which same one? It's very difficult for me to speak with this person. Doctor wants to know how you ended up there. - Yes, exactly. The doctor knows it. I bit his hand then. Yes! Oh! You were a little excited when we met. But why did you come for me? - I must come, when I'm called. But who called you? - People living in the ghetto. I think they wished you well. I can assure you - you were saved from big problems indeed. Even from very big problems. I think this is enough for today. Doctor, do you know, how disgusting it is to walk on the earth, having fair hair and blue eyes. Especially when your forehead, nose and ear form an obtuse angle! Nationality does not interest me - the principle is important. Please, let me go back to the ghetto! Sergeant major Willy Zollenkopf has come on your orders. So, you are the hero of whom everybody is talking about. Why can't I leave? - When you're well. We're still examining you. Maybe you would prefer to talk in your native tongue? Why? One has to respect the people among whom one lives. I personally learned the spoken language in four months. How many times did you go to the enemy's rear? - Three times. For reconnaissance, yes? - What do you think, an excursion? How did the enemy look at letting you walk through its front line and back? And... - Allow me! - And you weren't caught even once? Whether I was caught or not, you can soon ask them yourself. One thing interests me - how did you end up here? What is the matter with you? My nerves are shattered. If you have read this, you should know. Who cares what's written! I want to hear again the story of how you went to the regiment HQs and wanted to shoot all the officers. I couldn?t pull it off. They hit me on the back of my head, right on my old wound. This is not an answer. I'm interested in reasons that made you do it. We had just had our breakfast. - Go on! - It wasn't a good one. I hadn't killed anyone yet. You won't understand. You haven't seen the front line. You wanted to kill your own men. Or weren't they your own? Give me a machinegun! Give it to me quick! I am itching to shoot this bastard! Stand up! I'll drive it right between your eyes! Bang! Bang! Bang! Wait, Willy! Relax, relax. Good chap! Good, good chap! Relax! Stand over there. I'll stand here. Shh... so! So! We'll play it so that government is sails, people are wind, state is a ship and time is a sea! Let's start. Hello, I'm the wind. And I'm the government. That means sails. Stop! Stop! Government must respect the people. Please take it once more, please! - I'm the wind. But I'm the government. I'm not afraid of you! It means something is wrong here. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, tally-ho! Stop! Stop! Something is rotten in our state, tally-ho! I can't perform sails. - More thoughts, more thoughts. Hello-hello! - Ex... excuse me... Why are you changing the lines? Right, it shouldn't be done. - Who has written the lines? We have an editor here, Eduard... I know, I read his file. Before the war he was considered a talented writer. We know those talented ones. Talent is always suspicious. Send that talented person to me. What interests you? Yes, you? Why aren't you in the ward? Answer! Name? Mine? - Yours. Sophie. - Surname? Mine? - Answer! Schneider. Come later to the office of the chief doctor. - Me? Yes, namely you. Sit here, please. Medicine today makes miracles. Wait... do you... think that I can again... start writing? Write, sing, dance - everything you wish, only you have to listen to what the doctors say. But he can also dance, write, sing - all that he wants? Who? Who? Hallucinosis, chronic. Tell me, Eduard. - Yes? Did you drink a lot? In the old days I didn't drink at all, but later... the nature of my work drove me. It's not nice to work in the area of propaganda and... Work? Do you know at all what kind of work it is? To write things you don't believe in yourself? To write day and night, crossing a street, sitting at a desk, in a cafe, restaurant, write while laying in bed by your wife. Even in my sleep I've written many lines. But the brain gets tired. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, and then you start wishing to put on the brakes somehow, stop it, at the beginning a few small ones, later half a bottle, maybe more. Eduard, I imagine that creative work is first of all a pleasure. When in secondary school, I also wrote - short verses, but I didn't drink a drop. We are not talking about the same things. I will leave. - Now, now. When I was appointed as a newspaper editor, I started to feel tired already in the mornings. No, I'll go. You should have rested. Fresh air. Skis. I didn't have skis, doctor, and I have never gone fishing. I felt... you know? Are you trying to tell me that the confiscated newspaper issue was made in a drunken state? No! By no means! On that day, on my way to the office I drank only half a bottle of beer. I mentioned that also to the police when I was arrested. Oh, how humiliating those explanations were! Soldiers coming to teach us to write. - Let's leave the emotions! Sit down! Dear Eduard, we keep digressing from the main theme. Tell me, how could it happen that that notorious article appeared in the newspaper? - I didn't write alone. He helped me. Who? - Shh! He. Who? Come now, be more specific. - The devil... Thought and our era. Again he doesn't let me write. - What? The title: "Thought and Our Era". Thought and our era! Golden words! Why do they make you excited? It was a headline in the newspaper that was confiscated. It was typeset in very large print for the first time ... without a lie. A pity I have not read that article! - Yes, it's a pity. Last night the devil wrote some sentences on my back, shoulders and chest. Look! Oh, there is nothing left! Eduard! It?s because I dried myself with a coarse towel this morning. You should get some rest. Thank you very much. I really am tired. Excuse me, I'll just take away the devil or it'll cause you all sorts of trouble. Oh, look, where the devil has climbed into! Excuse me! Goodbye! Goodbye!
