- It's a great machine, ain't it? - Yeah. - When I cut in a supercharger, I get up to about a 140. - Wow. - Yeah, can't keep it there though. The friction will melt the engine like a marshmallow. - Yeah. - I've never met a woman who's interested in cars as you are. - Oh, I lived with a guy who's a Formula driver, for a while. I mean it didn't work out but he told me a lot about cars. And I loved it, I really loved it. - Uh-huh. - What about your professional image? I mean, what do people say when the doctor's drives up in a hot Corvette? - I don't make house calls. I'm a dentist. - Oh, a dentist? Oh, I thought you were a doctor. - I knew you were gonna think that. I'm an oral surgeon. I make about $25,000 a year more than your average doctor. - Gmm. I'm nothing against dentists. I think they're very important. Look at my teeth. Aren't they great? I owe that all to a dentist. This is really pretty up here. Can I drive this thing? - Something wrong with my driving? - No, nothing, nothing. Ijust feel like driving. I told you, I have a thing for cars. It's in my blood, a passion. - I hope that's not the only thing you have a passion for. - No, no. Well, can I drive? . Okay' - This car is fantastic. Can I open it up? - Hey, there's $12,000 worth of machinery here. - That's why I can take it. With this car, you don't have to be afraid. - Are you kidding? - Trust me! - Okay, just slow down. Let them pass. - Oh, darling. - Darling! - Hey, take a look at-- - Eh, get that all outta here! - Aw, she was mad. - Hey, fetch me a beer! - Morons! - Hey, go on, babe!

And it was a chick too! - Take it easy, man! Take it easy! No fighting! No fighting! - Get up! - The ride that has supercharger in it! Take it easy! - For Christ sake! - I don't mean it! I don't mean it, okay? - Gotta find that fucking cunt. I'm gonna ram that supercharger up her ass. You understand? - Easy! We'll find her, Lep, we'll find her. - Easy, Lep, easy, easy, come on. Easy now, okay? Okay, man, huh? - Hey! doc! How is it going? We were start to wonder whether not you was gonna make it up this weekend. - That's right, we were just talking about it, hey, Ralph? . YGP- - I had a few things to clear up. Listen, Spragg- - Yeah? - Have you got the boat running okay? - Like a charm, knock like a charm. - And I finished painting the boathouse just like you told me. Wait till you see it! - Good, good. I want everything to be just right this weekend. Very special, huh? Huh? - She sure is something, doc. - Boy, she's the best one yet, doc. - You're goddamn right. She's a model. - She's what? - A model. Model, you know, magazines, television commercials. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - You know what they say about models, do ya? - No, what do they say? - They say, if you don't give it to 'em for at least six hours, they feel cheated. ' He!!! hey. hey, doc, you didn't happen to remember-- - Oh. I knew I forgot something. - Oh, no, doc. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, put it right beside the car purposely too. Come on, you boys knew I wouldn't forget you. - Oh, goddamn you, doc. - Sheesh, you really out of school that time, doc. - For god's sake, don't you drink that all tonight, huh? - Oh, just a little nip. - Ralph, put the roof on, fill up the tank and we'll straighten up Monday morning, okay? - Right, sure, we'll come. - There is no rush. We'll be here. All, have a good time. You know. - All right, doc! - Ah, it's gorgeous country. We're almost there now. That place is really isolated. 10 square miles of privacy. - We're very lucky. - Come on, push, geez! - Come on, Runt, goddammit! - Get up, get up! - Hey, there, wait, hey, hey! - Give me a break! - Wait for me! - Gotta get up your ass! - Well, this is it. How do you like it? It's my leak. Not another house on it, complete privacy. - Where is everybody? . Who? - Well, your guests. - Oh, they're wandering at their leisure through the day. Come on, let's get these stuff inside, I'll show you around. - Oh. Oh mY- This is intense. - Thank you. - I really love this old place. Where did you get all these? - Auctions, a lot of it and a lot of it came with the place. Like this piano. The original owners had no idea what it was worth and I got it for about 1/5 of its actual value. Huh. - Do yOu PlaY7 - No, no. This used to be the famous Davis' mansion. - Whose? - The Davis' mansion. Come on, now, everybody's heard of the Davises. They used to own just about every newspaper in this country one time. Old man Davis was a senator. - I never heard of him but he had a very nice house. - Oh, he had money and power, I guess that's what's all about. - That's very important to you, isn't it? - It is to everyone. - Is it? - Money talks. I never had any money till I was 23 years old. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Having it is a hell of a lot better than not having it. - That's a very big fireplace. - Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, it's the original. Had to do some repairs on it, of course but it's pretty much the way it was in our day. It's called a tooter fireplace. See, people used to sit here right by the fire, huh. And this beam came out of an old Georgian bay sloop. Solid, huh. Don't make 'em like that anymore. - Were you married or something? - Not a chance. - Then why such a large place? - I like the biggest and the best of everything. Nothing wrong with that, is there? - No, not if you can afford it and that's the way you want it. - That's the way I want it. - Well, which is my room with all these many? - Let me show you, this way. . Okay' - Ah-ah. - Thank you. Oh mY- My. This room is bigger than my entire apartment. - Well, I'm glad you like it. - Hm. - I had the entire room redecorated. Thinking more modern, you know. Bathroom, right in here if you wanna get freshened up a bit. - Oh, yeah. My, ooh. I feel spoiled already. - Well, you just relax, I got a few things to clear up. You just make yourself at home. - Thank you. Like a hotel. Maybe I had the wrong room. - You want some gas? - No, you see some Corvette runner? - No. - You fooling around? - No. - You shouldn't. Let it go, let's spit. - Thanks for the oil stain, honey. - Ooh, honey! Show your tits, honey, I'll show you the beard. - Just keep your eyes open for the Vette. Oh, shit, Smokey the Bear. - Hey, check the uniform. - Yes, sir. - What do you say, general? - Where do you guys think you're going? - Oh, we're looking for some friends. - Well, you're not gonna find them here. This is a family group camp ground. - Oh. - Didn't you see the sign out of the front gate? - No, I didn't see it. - It said no admittance without a permit. - Permit, oh! You got the permit, Runt? - Here you are, man. - What are you doing? He caught my arm. MY arm! - Run, you fucking prick! - Bombs away! - Bull's eye! - Going this way. This might be an interesting shot over here, huh. Shooting right across the lake. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What's the matter? - It's a bog here. It's all covered over but some of these is 10, 15 feet deep. - You're kidding? - No, I told those two morons to come and fill it in with stones but doesn't look like they done a damn thing. - 53 avenue. Meet Mr. Baker at. - So, you're the people who saw this happened. - Oh, I saw it happened, officer. - What's your name, sir? - Doobie. D-O-O-B-I-E. George Doobie. - Did he say anything about what happened? - Oh, I'll tell what happened. He was talking to these two young fellas. And he reached his arm inside. - And then he put his arm right in the car and the car start moving and his arm got caught. - He's arm didn't get caught. They were holding onto it. - Now, wait a minute, please. One at time. Did you get his license plate number? - Oh no, he's too far away. - He's shortsighted. - Well, can you give me a description? - Dark color. - What make? - Oh, I don't know, it's one of those, you know, cars has all changed around with the big wheels on it. - And it made a lot of noise. - Wait a minute. Come on. There, I fixed it. - L dqn't get it. Why would you wanna know anything about engines? - I told you, someone taught me once and I really was interested. - Ijust never met a woman who could fix a carburetor and drive a car you did. - Well, ljust figured it helps makes life simpler if you know how fix some of these things, right? - Here's to more like you. - Thank you. - Would you pose in a nude? - No, lwould not pose in a nude. - I'm just asking. - It was a strange question. - It's just I'm a great admirer of the female parts. - Oh. - Would like a drink? - Yeah, I'll have a drink. All of these is really yours? - Yeah, as far as you can see. - You must be pulling a lot of teeth to pay for these. - Why? Why is it that people like to make fun of dentists? Can you tell me? You know that dentists have the highest rate of suicide of all the professions, did you know that? - I seem to be saying all the wrong things today. - I forgive you. - Don't you think we oughta be getting back? Some of your guests must be here by now. - Relax, relax, they know their way around. You got a hell of a body, you know that? - Thank you. - All right, when I first saw you dancing at party, I said to myself, that's for me. Now, when I see something I want. - Mm-hm. - I don't give up until I get it. - Harry, we just started. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I mean ljust simply like to get to know you. - Pull off, Lep. Here, stop! Hey! "Ian! - Yeah? - How you doing? Fill her up with super, please. - Oh, sure. - Hey, two will get you five, they fuck goats. - Hey, get the windshield too, huh. - Here, Ralph. - Bet you know everybody around here. - I guess you could say that, just about. - Who owns the Vette? - Well, it ain't me, I can tell you that. - He didn't ask you that. - I don't know! - Who is-- - Stanley, calm down. The reason we ask, friend, is we had a little trouble up the road, this came guy along in a black Corvette and he helped us up and we didn't get a chance to get his name or even thank him. - Oh, he's Doc. Black. - He's Doc. Black, yeah. - He's got a white Cadillac too. That depends upon which woman he brings up on the weekend. - No, shit huh. - Yeah. You know, that man's brought a different girl up here every weekend this summer? - Amazing. - Yeah. - Listen, do you know where we could find him? - Well, yeah, you just go out here and you turn right. You got about two miles, big gates, there you go. - Yeah, I appreciate that. Here you g0, P0P- The fly's open, man. - Now, this is more comfortable, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah, I suppose. No, no, no, thank you. - Now, I wanna give you every opportunity to really get to know me. Now, why don't you give Harry a little kiss, huh? - Now, come on, Harry. You're really behaving like a fool. - For Christ's sake, give me a break, will you? - Why don't you give me a break? By the way, where are all these people that you said were coming up for the weekend. - There's no one else coming up. - What? - There's no one else coming up! - You explicitly told me that all these other people were coming up for the weekend. - Come on, now. Don1. You're a big girl now, you know exactly what's going on. Don't give me that shit. - No, I don't know what's going on. And I think this is very peculiar. First of all, I don't pose in a nude. I don't sleep with men I just met and especially with men I don't like. - What the hell do you want? A health certificate? - No, that's not the point. I don't think this is gonna work. - You don't think this is gonna work, this weekend has every indication of being a complete disaster and you don't think it's gonna work. - I think I better leave. - I think that's the best idea you had yet. - Well, will you just wait until I get my stuff and then drive me to the nearest bus depot? - Sweetheart, there's the road. You just get your things together. I'm sure you'll find a way. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. - Harry, no wonder dentists have the highest suicide rate. ' UP yours. - Harry? - Surprise, girl. You scream and I'll knock your teeth out. - Help! - Don't do that. Good, there. Now, that's better. Oh, aren't you pretty? What's under these? - Diane? Look, I feel stupid. I acted like a jerk.

You cunt, you could've killed me! - What the hell is going on?
