He will get at least 10 years rigorous imprisonment. He got our village road made in 10 days which took 10 years.. ..for the government. He is a big fraud. He gave employment to 10,000 people from our district. Put him in prison to rot forever. He should never be released! The whole of lndia will burn if he is hurt even a little. Name? - Sivaji. Father's Name? - Armukham. Salutations, sir. ls it a murder case? ls it a finance company scam? - No. Did you make some adult film and release it on the internet? - No. Then what crime did you commit? l did good work for the nation.

Hi, Sister. Hi, Brother-in-law. Hi, Brother-in-law. - They are the producers of Sivaji. Parents. Mother and father. Don't you dare strip his dhoti! lf Sivaji's parents are getting so much.. ..then imagine how much Sivaji will get. Mother, bless me. - He's an emperor of styles. Lord, please bless my son. Father. - Bless you, son. Look here. - Hi, Uncle. How are you? Uncle? Am l your uncle? ls it fair on your part? You're my mother's brother. Should l call you paternal uncle? Who are they? These are the latest modern girls in the city. Sister wanted you to get married. So l brought all of them. Select one of them. l'll fix the girl for you. Now aren't you proving to be my uncle? Vibhuti. (Sacred ash)! Why is she smearing herself on me? Hey, Uncle, lndia has developed. Okay, girls. Thanks for coming this far for me. There is a party in the evening, isn't it? See you there. Dear Sivaji, what work do you do abroad? When someone asks, l am clueless. Software system architect, Mother. Say it in Hindi, son. - Software System Architect. Do you understand it now? He's a computer engineer. Cool. ls this lndia? Yes, this is modern lndia. We get everything from Levis Jeans to Rolex watches. Everything has come from there. Sir, we've not eaten for four days. Alms please, sir. Everything has come. But poverty has not gone. May you have a long life. How long are you going to stay this time, son? Forever. Enough of earning money by making software.. ..which make the rich even richer. Now l am going to use that money for the betterment of the needy. Great, Sivaji. Will your net worth be Rs. 250 crores? Yes, around that much.. give or take 10 dollars! Greetings, sir. Welcome, sir. Greetings. Greetings. Sivaji, he is the great Adiseshan. - Greetings. He has many educational institutions hospitals.. ..and industries to his name. His visiting card is as big as a menu card. He is a great business magnate. He runs the government. He is exaggerating. l am just like an attendant. Friends, l was born in a poor farmer family. My parents toiled hard for my studies. l studied abroad with scholarships and have come to this level. l want to do some good for my nation. Our nation is still suffering from poverty. Only proper education can eradicate poverty. To make it happen, .. l am going to start a university named Sivaji University. lt'll provide education from LKG to Ph.D. and.. ..from Arts to Medical sciences, free of cost. l am going to open Sivaji Hospital.. ..and it will provide facilities from E.N.T. to open heart surgery.. ..free of cost, that would match international standards. l request all of you to extend your support.. ..for the success of Sivaji Foundations. l think l will take your leave now. lt's getting late. Thank you for taking out some time and accepting my invitation. Good. Keep it up. Ask me if you need any help. You can meet me whenever you want. Thank you. Hi, Shiv. Come on. Let's dance. Hi, Vibhuti. Let's go man. - No, no, no, no. Don't feel shy. Please wait. Hey, DJ, change the music. Which number do you want me to play, sir? l want to hear a song of our nation. A nice lndian song. Song and dance. Can we? Hello, sir. - Hello. - Please come. Deposit this in the office. Your son can get admission after you pay the balance of Rs.8 lakhs. l have already sold everything. - We have nothing to spare. Please enrol my son. Assume these Rs.18 lakhs to be an investment. Your son will earn more than this when he becomes a doctor. Won't you take Rs.1 crore as dowry? l will somehow earn and repay you. Please, sir. Welcome, Sivaji. Sir is calling. Please come. - You may go. But pay the balance before the 10th of the next month. Come, Uncle. Go, madam. - Welcome. Please sit. Please sit. l've made all the plans ready for you. l suggest you buy 20 acres of land to build complexes.. ..apartments and get into real estate business.. ..or build five star hotels. But we came for help regarding universities, hospitals, etc. Forget all that. l am running a university and a hospital since 20 years. l take from Rs.3 lakhs to Rs.30 lakhs for a college seat. l take Rs.2.5 lakhs for an open heart surgery. lf you start a university and a hospital where you.. ..give service free of cost.. ..what will happen to my business? l always want us to be friends. You can do a real estate business. l've a clout in all government departments. l'll get all the approvals in just a week's time. No, sir. This is my ambition. You can proceed. l've no objection. But my staff is a little violent. They won't pay heed to what l say. They'll harm my opponents. Like you, there was an NRl from London. His name was.. What was his name? They beat him up and drove him off. Wonder where he is. Don't know whether he's alive or dead. Are you threatening me? - No, l am not. l am telling you the fact. Then it's your wish. lt doesn't matter if you don't help. l'll manage. Wish you all the best. l'll pray to God that you succeed in your project. Hello. Whom do you want to meet? - We want to meet the chief secretary. Good project. The government will help you in all respects. Cool! This is Parthasarthy. My personal secretary. He will give you all the details. Where is the girl, Uncle? Still have to find her, Nephew. - What? We'll roam in all the temples. We'll fix up if you like anyone. Uncle, you.. why do l need to experience this now? Because the type of girls you seek have joined call centers. The girls who're not in that list can be found only in weddings.. ..or on Fridays in these temples. Let me see whether you can find one. - Get lost. Mangala. - Where? There. She is superb. Hey, Uncle, go and talk to her. You studied at the Oxford, you should speak. lt's so embarrassing. l feel very shy and uncomfortable ..to speak to a strange woman, you know. lt's you who wants to get married so you should speak to her. Go. Where is she? We've missed her. Forget that girl. Here comes one spacious girl. God, she hit me with her portico. - Quiet! Place an order for foreign liquor with soda. Here, we've brought this. - That is for me to take home. For your project, we've to get approvals from the fire department.. ..the airport authority.. ..the local municipality, the water board.. ..TNEB, pollution control board.. and 16 such departments. There are different council regulations to build.. ..a medical college. We've to apply and satisfy officials at Delhi. We have to obtain signatures from 560 people and sign at 720 places. lt will take a year to get it done, sir. l want your help to get the work done speedily. Another large one. What is your project's budget? - Rs.200 crores. Pay me 2% . That is Rs.4 crores. Give it to me. l will get your work done. Why should l pay you Rs.4 crores? Why do you talk ignorantly? You're required to pay right from higher officials to.. ..the lowest ranked staff. What if l don't? - The work won't be completed. They neither ask explicitly nor do they accept directly. They should be approached and paid through the proper channel. Can you do all that? That's why l am here for all that. One stop shop. One more large. Why should l pay? Why should l pay all of you? l am trying to provide good education and medical facilities.. ..with my hard earned money. Why should l bribe all of you? This approval is not for doing business.. ..but to provide service to the needy. You can. But l am not ready to do service. Without bribing, you can't build even a toilet here. l don't require anyone's help. l am educated. l will follow all the rules. Fill up each and every form. l won't entertain bribes, but get the approval. Grab that bottle. - Don't get emotional, Sivaji. There is no point developing an enmity with these people. Listen to me. l have seen many of his kind. He's a fraud. Uncle. Don't be scared of him. Keep the bottle down. - You're not giving it to me for nothing. These are the consulting fees for wasting my time. What about the liquor you consumed? My service charges. - You cheat. Go. l know you'll come back to me someday. Get lost, bald head. Never. This looks like a violation. ls the valuation FBO or ClF? The valuation is wrong. Your building is not in the institutional category. A zone conversion will have to be done. Because it is outside city limits get an NOC from.. ..the 'Tehsildar'(Official). You can't build more than four floors in this area. Read the Establishment of Medical College Regulations (2000) once. Have you got the RBl clearance to bring funds into lndia? We require a legal opinion for the sale deed. Only the central government is authorized to do this. Check under CRZ. Where is Form 1 part 136? Sivaji, even if you provide all the documents they'll find fault.. ..in something or the other. We have two options. One is to pay all of them. Or to drop the project. Nothing will happen here unless we pay them, Sivaji. Didn't l say that you would come back to me? Have it? - What about that matter? About the girl? She is in suite No.35. Go there. Superb number. - lf we add, it would make 8. lf l give a call, the cops will come for a raid. Take the room keys. Uncle.. they've really made me one, Sivaji. This university construction should get over in 6 months time. lt will definitely be done. Sivaji, good news. - What? The girl whom we saw at the temple, she is Vidyabharti. She has graduated in Sanskrit Literature. - Very good! She didn't get any suitable job that is why she's employed.. ..at the Royal musical store as a sales girl. Her house is close by. You're great, Uncle. Come, let us go right away. lf we go suddenly, she'll drive us out. l've found another way. - What is that? My own way. Who are you? Officers. What officers? Assistant electoral officers from the Election Commission Of lndia. l'll explain it to you. We're here for family planning for all of you. We've come to draft a voters list for voter's identity cards. He is very strict. What are you staring at? Let's go inside. Please come,sir. - Please come in. Who is the head of the family? lt's me. Ramalingam. - Your age? 48. - Female head of the family? -Jyoti. - Age? 42 ? years. There is a girl in your house. Ask her to come. - Girl? Ask your daughter to come. Why should she come? Ask me whatever you want to. l'll give the details. l can't do that. l should see her in person. Else it would be a fake voters list. Ask her to come. - Because sir is very strict. Bharti, dear, those guys look suspicious. Keep them involved with your talks. Sivaji, stop ogling at her. Start. Your sweet name? - Vidyabharti. Age? - 21 . Size? - 6. 6? - Size of my footwear. Mother, what is this? - Can you cook? Can you make spicy gravy? Where are you going? To the toilet. - Get lost. You can also accompany him. No need to hurry. Take your own time. Meanwhile, we'll get her details. We'll get the family details. What happened? -Two burglars have come to our house. lnform the cops. - Don't worry. l'll take care. Father. - Sivaji. Brother-in-law has come. Why have you arrested them? Do you know who he is? A great computer engineer. He has returned from the U.S.A. He is the owner of property worth Rs.250 crores. This is his certificate. This is his passport, credit card and his green card. Do you know what a green card is? lt is like their ration card. Are you alright? - The cell didn't have a fan as well. - Keep quiet! What was the need to impersonate as census officers.. ..and go to their house? We didn't go for that. We went to enquire about her. What is all this, Sivaji? l have developed a liking for her. l wanted to know about her. But he gave this stupid idea. Sivaji likes a girl? This is what we were waiting for. Aren't you her parents? Please come here. - Get up. Please come. Go. Get coffee for everyone. Also ask him to get the auspicious things for the engagement. Get that also. Hello. Everyone is out of the station. Over. We belong to Dharmapuri. We don't bother about caste and don't accept dowry. ls this a police station or a marriage hall? lnspector, most marriages are made in the police station. Don't waste time being tense. Bring a daily calendar and we will fix a date. All the expense is ours and the marriage .. will take place in Tamil culture. Will you feed your milk to the baby after birth? What is all this? l am just asking her. What if she feeds powdered milk? The baby's health is important, isn't it? l fed mother's milk to my child for 5 years. He doesn't look milk-fed, but looks decoction-fed. Mother, why am l dark skinned? Because if you were fair you'd have become dirty. Marriage will be at the next auspicious date. lt will be in Raja Narayana marriage hall. Stop it. Are all of you mad or do we look like mad people? Yes. - What? Your manners are not good. How can we plan the marriage.. ..without knowing anything? lf left to you, you may even arrange for the pregnancy ceremony. Come, let's go. lnspector, we need protection to go home. Leave it. They are too much. There are many brides waiting for you in a queue. - No, Uncle. Life is full of happiness if we marry the one we like.. ..than the one we get. Wow! This is like a slogan written behind trucks. Greetings, sir. - ls the minister there? Adi Seshan sir has come. Welcome. Had you informed, l would've come. Take a seat. - Stop the drama, Anandam. An enemy of mine, Sivaji, came from America to build universities here. What are all of you doing? ls it? l don't know. Don't act. All the departments signed and gave permission. He has even started the construction. Have you taken bribe as well? - No. See, Minister, l've spent a lot on your party and you. Don't get tense. l'll tell my personal assistant.. ..to look after it. lf he has started, we will get it stopped. There are many stages remaining. Leave it. l'll take care of it. He is a two-faced person. We cannot trust him. We have to stop Sivaji. Should l kill him? Yes, do that. Where? There.. Wow, superb. Why have you come here? We came to buy instruments. Can we get a bigger size in this? lt's okay. A drum for me. For you? For me, a girl with a sweet voice. - You started again. Please don't mind. We came to your house to know if you are a family girl.. ..or look like one only when you visit the temple. Sorry. What do you want now? - Your hand. You are asking as if it's a snack. Who are you? l don't know you at all. ls that all? Here you go. Have you got it? - Marry him. Are you kidding? My father told you the other day, didn't he? Are you related as friends or neighbors to us? We are not related to you. How could l marry someone if l am not related to him? You are right. So we must improve relations, right? Cool. Sister, any dispute? lf there is anything, tell me. l'll solve it. Nothing. But we've some dispute. We'll solve it. Brother, come over here. Has someone spit betel leaf in his hair? Brother, you are talking too much. Brother, are you Sivaji? - Yes. You? - Tipu Sultan. l have heard that you are going to build colleges, hospitals.. How does it concern you? - Somebody doesn't like that. Drop this idea and build something else like a computer company.. ..shopping mall, multiplex. Do something like that. Who are you to say that? Are you asking who l am? l fly and hit like Superman. l hang and beat like Spiderman. l roll and bash up like Batman. And l am the bone crusher Doberman. Kannan. Sivaji, are you going to give a punch dialogue? - Why? Nowadays everyone has started giving punch dialogues in lndia. Small children have started doing it. Leave it. - You proceed. Mobile Kannan. 'Kanal'(Fire). - That's it. A train runs on the railway tracks. lf you confront Sivaji, you are a dead body. Children watch Pogo. After 6, it is 7. After him there is no one. How was it? - Now stop. Go and inform them that no one can stop me. l think he doesn't pay heed to us. lt seems we must fix him. Come on, let's start bashing him. Cool.. Come! Mom, please come here. They have come with the family. Why have all of you come? - We came to know all of you. You want to know us? Yes. You said that you will not give a bride to an unknown person. So we came to get acquainted. Come, let's go. Do you think this is funny? - Yes. What? Nonsense. We won't give our girl. There is no need to give a bride. Let us know each other. Marry if you like us, else we'll be friends. Mother, is sugar necessary for them? Let's add salt in it. ls this conch mark? No, vessel mark. - Uncle, do you want something? How about beer? - No, there is only buttermilk. ls it? Go and bring two beers. Sorry, sir. What do you want to drink? - Poison. Poison? Here it is. Have it. Drink soon and go. You are offering only coffee. ls there nothing sweet or spicy to eat? - No. We came with family members for the first time. Offering some sweet and spicy food is our culture isn't it? We don't believe in it. So you want sweet and spicy food? - Yes. - l'll get it. Thank you. - Thank you. Sivaji. They mixed rat killer in the coffee. They are trying to kill me. Call the ambulance. ln our city traffic, the ambulance will get stuck. This is sweet and this is hot. Looks like they will poison us. What have they mixed? - Have it.. Don't eat. - Keep quiet. l'll even have poison if she gives it with her hands. lf we have all this, we will suffer with stools and burns. Don't eat, listen to me. He put it in his mouth. Wash room, please. Thank you. Where are you going? To the toilet. - Proceed. Somebody cast an evil eye on my son. This is not an evil eye, but a chilly eye. Sivaji. What happened? Nothing. - Was a King Kong trailer running inside? - Gargling. Okay, very nice. We successfully finished the first course of knowing each other. Next course is that all of you must come to our house.. ..next Sunday for a treat. No, we won't come. Please come whether you wish to come or not. He will come at 1 1 :00 with a car to pick you up. lf you want to buy fruits, vegetables and flowers.. ..on the way he will arrange for it. You have to come. You must come. See you on Sunday. Bye. - Bye. You have accepted to become the dean for our medical college. l feel proud about that. - lt is my pleasure. We are constructing the anatomy and pathology lab here. Bring that driller here. - Okay, sir. What happened? He stepped on that wire and lost his life. ls there any hope, Doctor? The heart beat and pulse have stopped. Please do something, Doctor. - Let me try. Lift him. Quickly. Quickly. Mother. - Our son is alive. You are great, Doctor. - Thanks. You saved my son like God. - Many thanks. - lt's all right. Don't you know that child labor is a crime? l wish to educate him. But l have no money. l will give you. Send him for studies. Many thanks, sir. Listen, contractor, if you make children work, l'll sack you. Remarkable, Doctor. l had lost all hopes. How did you do that? We call it CPR. We can make a person alive if we apply CPR within a few minutes.. ..if the heart stops functioning suddenly. l see. - Even then if it doesn't function.. ..we can give shock through a defibrillator and activate it. Cool, Doctor. Aren't all of you ready for the treat yet? We mentioned that day itself that we are not coming. Won't come? They have prepared the meal.. ..with grandeur and are awaiting eagerly to have.. ..a treat with all of you without even having.. ..a sip of water since morning. Come on, let's go. - Did we ask them to prepare? We spent Rs.8000 per plate. We cooked turtle too. Why mind eating free of cost? We do not wish to come. - But we do. Will you go from here or shall l call the police? Will you come or shall l call Sivaji? They are not coming. You come here with your family immediately. Don't. - Hold on. Sir, doesn't all this seem a bit too much? Cool. You are a very special guest for us. Welcome. Come, let us get to know each other. Come, Ramu. Come. All types of vegetarian food has been prepared. There is a variety of non-vegetarian food here. Everyone, eat to your heart's content without feeling shy. What are you searching for? You had said that you prepared a turtle dish. A kitten dish is also made. l said that for rhyming. You're not eating properly. Have this food. Come. After marriage, we are going to stay in this room. Yes. All these are for you. These are to wear when you go out. This is to wear at home. These are matching blouses. These ornaments are for you. These are soaps, shampoos, perfumes and cosmetics. These are all healthy food and medicines.. ..for you when you are pregnant. l bought everything for our baby till its third year. This is for a baby boy and this is for a baby girl. l've bought everything for you to make you comfortable. You just have to give your consent once. Stop it. Stop the work. Who is the contractor? Stop all the work. - What is the problem? Violation, sir. The government ordered to bring it down immediately. Are you joking? We got all the clearances and spent crores and finished.. ..more than 1/2 of the construction.. ..and now you are talking nonsense. Sir, in this area, a government residential complex.. ..is going to be constructed. Stop the work and all of you come out. lf the work is stopped then the consequences won't be healthy. Why are you getting angry with me? l am just a government servant. l am doing my duty. Whatever you have to say, go and tell the minister. ls it enough if the officers sign? Why am l here as a minister? You should have first come to me. We erred by not coming to you. Now tell us what we should do? lt is too late. l can't do anything now. We have finished the construction. What can l do if you ask to stop now? l never asked for help from anybody. Help me, please. What is the value of your project? God, the same question. Rs.200 crores. Give 25% from that which is Rs.50 crores for party fund. l'll give you the permission. Rs.50 crores? Why are you shocked? You will earn by using the title of capitation operation. You will earn it within a year, isn't it? l didn't start this project for earning. All of them say that in the beginning. How can we arrange for Rs.50 crores all of a sudden? We have invested all the money in this. l can understand your problem There is pressure from Adiseshan. lt is he who started this violation problem. lf l want to do this without caring for him, l want Rs.50 crores. Do l have to give Rs.50 crores to do a good job? That's why l told you in the beginning itself that l can't. Sir. Sir, please. Come with me for a minute. Frauds. Thieves. Sivaji, no use talking to him. We are stuck and it's impossible to get out. He is wedging us at the right time. We will borrow the money because there is no other way out for us. Come, Sivaji. Give the documents of the house. Sir, the constructed area is 8750 sq.ft. The house alone is not enough for this amount. Take this. This also belongs to him. Agricultural.. ..land, bonds, shares and investments. Sign in front of the cross marks. Don't worry, Sivaji. Think of your dream and sign. Hi, Bharati. Happy 'Diwali' (lndian festival of lights). We have never seen a family like yours. We were afraid seeing your money and extreme love. You won us with your goodness. Give your son's horoscope. Happy 'Diwali'. - Thanks. You have shown who you are, Anandam. Come, have a seat. We can't stop.. ..if all the documents are correct. Then why do l need all of you? The government is not only for you. We have to allow sometimes.. ..when good projects come forth for people Why is he talking very responsibly? lt's the Rs.50 crores that are speaking, sir. Then what about the money that l fed you? You earned much more than you invested. Leave others to earn money as well. Won't you change the order? l can't. The order has been filed. The GO also has been sent. Then l will have to replace you. What if we overthrow your government? lf we give a chance to the opposite party? Your government will not last long, Anandam. Arrange for the no confidence vote in the.. ..legislative assembly immediately. Don't bother about the expense. Hi! Have the horoscopes been matched? When will we fix the marriage? Marriage? Who said? You formed good relations with us and also asked for the horoscope. My parents asked for the horoscope. You came and became friendly with us. lt's okay. Marriage is a different thing. - How much does this cost? lt is not sold here. Wait. Why are you throwing a bomb on me? There are some requirements for marriage. But we don't meet any. Give me that Kancheepuram one. Shall l give you something else? Tell me what doesn't match. No, you'll feel bad. l want to see the manager. - l am the manager. Get out. Even if you don't say, l'll feel bad. l don't care. Tell me. Show me your hand. Can you understand? lt's my hand and that's yours. God! Does it match? - Hey, are you calling him black? lndia will burst with anger. Lord 'Rama'(lndian mythological character) was black. Lord 'Krishna'(lndian mythological character) was black. Lord 'Shiva'(lndian mythological character) was black. Great poet Kalidas was black. That piano is black. Grapes are black. Half of lndia is also black. That's why l wasn't saying anything. You shouldn't talk about two things in lndia. One is a man's color and the other one is a politician's wealth. Apologize in front of everyone. Tell her. Uncle. Cool. See, l know you don't give importance to color. l think there is some other reason. Tell me. lt's nothing. This is the only reason. Break the door.. ..fire the bus and burn her idol. Bharati, what's all this? This customer is upset. Kill this customer. Uncle, keep quiet. What's wrong with her words? Madam, that one. Hello, madam. Just a minute. You are fair complexioned and l am black. ls that the problem? l'll change to a fairer complexion. How can you change yourself and be fair? Let us turn her black by pouring tar. l'll become fair and show her. Oh, my God! - Ghost. What is this? - What is this? All this dirt.. you've become like 'Anil Kapoor'(lndian actor).. ..in 'Nayak'(lndian movie). This is fuller's earth. Natural therapy. l'll be like 'Hrithik Roshan' (lndian actor) after washing it. Are you shocked? What have you done? You look like a negative of some photograph. Are you kidding? Now you're telling me it's not nice.. ..after a long struggle to become fair? Honestly, l liked that black complexion on you. lt doesn't look nice at all. - Saved, Nephew. Go and wash off that white flour. Then why did you say that l am black? Pardon me. l didn't expect that you would take this matter so seriously. Being black is not the reason to ignore you, but my horoscope. According to Vedic horoscope if people from these two stars unite.. ..then the groom will surely meet death and.. ..the wife will become a widow, so said Sukhdev. Groom Sivaji is from Chittiram constellation. Bride Bharti is from Ghanishtha constellation. lt is very dangerous. Amongst other 13 matches a few hindrances can be ignored. But a certain match has to be perfect. Both the horoscopes don't match. ln both the horoscopes there are bad stars in.. ..the 2nd, 7th and 9th houses. There will be a big monetary loss. He might be in danger because of the bride. lf you get them married he may even lose his life What are you saying? Look here. l have a mole on my tongue. Whatever l say comes true. You have come here to do good deeds. l said all that because l do not want you to undergo.. ..any harm by marrying me. ls that it? ls that the problem? Do you know what my astrologer said? lf l marry you, the Rs.200 crores that l have now will.. ..turn into Rs.1000 crores. We asked another astrologer for a second opinion. Do you know what he said? lmagine that they have already got married. He said that both of you would have twins. Now which one do you believe out of these? We can't live peacefully. lf we bother about all that. l like you. And you? Then why should you bother about all this? Life becomes miserable if we know the day of death. Only happiness is important. Will you be happy marrying me? Cool. God bless you. Chennai's resident Ramalingam's daughter.. ..Vidhya Bharati and Dharmapuri's resident Armukham's son.. Sivaji, on the 5th of the next month .. ..will be married with their elders blessings. After the exchange of the ritual plates the engagement.. ..ceremony has been completed. Adhiseshan. Long live. Our brother Adhiseshan! Long live! Welcome. l should have come to meet you to get your blessings. You are the new minister. l should give that respect. You proved that you are the king-maker. Thanks, sir. Show it in actions, not in words. Sir. lf you're Adhiseshan, l am an Alsatian. l'll wag my tail in front of you forever. Listen.. stop it. Stop it. Why are you breaking it? Government projects are coming up here. Like lT parks and future development projects. Your construction is illegal. Break it. What do you think? Every time you give some reason and start demolishing? You had taken Rs.50 crores and said that there would be no problem. What happened now? Sir, this is a new government order. lf you want, l'll come tomorrow morning. ln that much time if you can meet someone else to solve.. ..this problem, then please do so. No. A government project is going to be constructed in that place. Which fool gave you the permission? This is an illegal project. We can't permit it. What wrong have l done? Why are all of you doing this to me? ls this a punishment for me who came here to do good things? We met everybody. We gave enough to officers, ministers and everyone. No. You gave it to those people. To those ministers. We are fresh. We have invested a lot in this. Rate of seats, election expenses, publicity expenses.. ..MLA's rates, costs of politics have increased a lot. Now what do you want us to do? Tell me. What is your project value? How many times will you ask this question? What? - Nothing, sir. Rs.200 crores. Out of that give 25% or Rs.50 crores to growth fund. l'll look after the rest. You beggar. Am l asking for permission to run a brothel or an illicit.. ..liquor business? - Leave me. What are you doing? Don't spoil it, Sivaji. Here, they'll ask money even to build a statue for Gandhi. Uncle, keep quiet. Will you give permission or not? Give respect. Why should l give you respect? How can you talk to me like that? You can't start this university without giving us money. l won't. l won't give a single paise. l'll go to court. l'll go to the magistrate court, appellate court sessions court.. ..high court, supreme court. There must be some justice in this nation. l'll dig it out. Please do try. Sivaji, how are you? How is your university going on? Tell me if you need any help. What kind of a person are you? You are worse than insects. You won't die peacefully. - Whom do you.. That's not right. He is angry. l'll call you later. Loafer. lt's a cast iron case. We have to win. Will they cancel the GO arbitrarily if the government gets changed? lt is wrong. lt will not be valid in any court. As soon as l go to court in the morning.. ..l'll file a written complaint to vacate that stay. Else we'll get a stay order. This is my dream since 25 years. l have put in 20 years of hard work. l had put everything that l earned. l pledged all my property and house. We'll have to save this dream somehow. Don't worry. You had constructed it after getting the approval. l'll take care of it. We'll see about the fees later. Ask him to give some advance? How much, sir? Rs.20 lakhs. Rs.20 lakhs? We have to save a Rs.200 crores project, don't we? There is no money at all in the bank. l crossed the over draft limit as well. You may keep my car as an advance. No, sir. That feels very bad. No, please don't. Was l born with a car? l walked without slippers in my childhood. l used to travel by bus. Win this case, that's all. Take it. Sivaji, you bought this car with passion. Sir, may l drop you home? - No, cool. Hereafter, l'll make a habit to walk. Let's go. ls it true that all the government departments.. ..initially refused a permit.. ..to start Sivaji Foundations? lt is true? ls it true that you bribed Rs.4 crores to the government.. ..officers in various departments? Objection. He was refused because they wanted bribes. Don't intervene. Your argument is over. You gave Rs.4 crores. True or not? lt is true. But.. ls it true that minister Anandam refused the permit? lt is true. That was when you offered him Rs.50 crores as bribe? - Yes. No more questions, your Honour. - To do good things for the country l was cornered. l was helpless. The petitioner himself has confessed that he had bribed.. ..various government departments to.. ..construct Sivaji Foundations illegally. This has been proved by the counsel beyond doubt. So the stay order to stop the construction is correct as per law. This court is permitting the government to.. ..demolish this foundation. The government need not compensate him for this. What is this, Sivaji? What has happened? Had you taken my advice, you would've ran a 5 star hotel.. ..or a real estate business. They've made you a pauper. What are you going to do now? Are you going to lift loads? Or are you going to become a milk man? Are you going to drive an auto rickshaw? l'll get you a conductor's job with my recommendation. Will you do it? But you need experience for that. There is a job which can be done sitting at one place. Would you do it? Our national job. l have all notes of 500. Do you have any change? Give it. Oh, Goddess! His job should prosper. l am very lucky. l'll be the first customer. Start begging, Sivaji. Excuse me, sir. Your debt amount is not equal to the value.. .. of this house, properties and other things. That's why nothing can go out of.. ..this house till the valuation is finished. Sorry. Your Rolex watch is also in our list, sir. Sorry, Father. Sorry, Mother. Go and stay at our native place till l get back to a better position. We are not worried. We were in this situation before you left for America. Come. Come, Sivaji. Right now my situation is not good. We will fix the marriage later. l came to inform you about that. Okay, Son-in-law. We can fix the marriage when your wish. No, Father. This marriage will never take place now. What are you saying, Bharti? l had told you not to further this alliance. You cajoled me into it. We are only engaged and this much has happened. lf we get married then Lord knows what.. lf anything happens to you as per the prediction.. All these are your imaginations. What imagination? Why would a construction, which was about to finish.. ..come to a demolishing stage? What made you poor when you were a millionaire? lt is a coincidence. No. We won't get married in this life. You may go. And don't come here ever again. 'Start begging Sivaji.' 'And don't come here ever again.' Road side food will always be tastier than what.. ..we have in a 5 star hotel. Have it. You better go to America. No, this is my native place. Where will l leave this place and go? l've to do good for the nation. How it is possible, Sivaji? With the help of this Re.1 coin. lf it shows tails, it's a flower path. lf it shows heads, it's a lion path. Fate or co-incidence will decide my path. From now on, l am going to go on the lion's path. Who is it? Sir, tomorrow morning they've arranged a marriage in your house. Marriage? That means a 'raid' in our department's language. lmmediately safeguard your accounts and documents. What nonsense are you speaking? The report is confirmed. Top secret. Don't try to contact any member of the parliament or anyone in Delhi. All your telephone lines are tapped. Sir. Seems the fertilizer has got over at the farm. They need it very urgently. Take it and leave. Why are you standing in the middle? Which way is the car going? - Till Tambaram. We'll get down on the way. How can l pick up an unknown person? We are your owner's friends. The car will be going inside. Get down here itself. Get up. Sir has sent the fertilizer sack. Keep it inside. - Okay. Everyone, come out. Who is it? Adi, are you awaiting the marriage procession? The marriage got over last night itself. Now we have the reception? Don't you understand? At the farm house. Only two people. All your documents have vanished. Who are you? Pride of Maharashtra. You are shocked just hearing the name? What do you want? Tell me. Fertilizer business. l started it with the Re.1 that you gave. l want to do business with you. l am waiting at the tea stall which is opposite the income tax office. You take your own time. But l'll go inside after 10 minutes with this fertilizer sack. Sir, snacks. - Thanks, boss. Sir is calling you. Ask him to come here. Come. Sit down. Bring hot snacks and tea for sir. Talk about business. l saw your books, hard disk and documents. lllegal house, land, properties.. ..money and bonds, dollars and green money in Swiss banks. Altogether you have Rs.200 crores of black money with you, isn't it? So what? - Have it. Have it, friend. Give me half of that.. Not snacks, the money. lf l don't.. All the documents will go inside the income tax office. Look there. Hey, Uncle. You may go. Tell him to stop. Hold on. You'll lose your Rs.200 crores.. ..in the form of seizure penalty and arrest. l'll get 10% which means Rs.20 crores as a reward.. ..for giving information about you. My business will become successful. Which one is better? ls losing everything or half of it? Are you threatening me? Sir. Call the commissioner. Do you think you are funny? That is black money, dear. You can't complaint. You should be quiet. You are a lonely person. l've the government in the palm of my hand. l have your head in my hand. Repeat. Tell him to stop. Hold on. l'll give you 24 hours time. Arrange for Rs.100 crores. l'll tell you later how and where you should bring it. Have tea. How much? - Rs. 20. Adi, pay for it. Deduct it from my Rs.100 crores. Come on! Take this! Just munch this beeda! Run for your life! Wearing a sari! ls it a Sega fight? Sivaji is always right! ls it a Sega fight? Sivaji is always right! Come on! Take this! Just munch this beeda! Run for your life! Wearing a sari! Move ahead. You are alighting just like a conductor. Why do you get upset when you see me? Why did you come here again? You are causing me and yourself pain. Please go. We came to buy a flute. Please play this. Please go. Manager, we came here to buy the flute. And she is telling us.. ..to go to some other shop and buy. What are you doing, Bharati? Behave properly with the customer. Flute. Flute. Look here. l am going to get a big amount within the next 24 hours. We can start the university. lt's not about the money. What if you die? Give me a break. Why are you ruining your life by believing in the horoscope? Give me a break! Why are you torturing yourself by believing the horoscope? You think l'll die if l marry you? l'll die even if l don't marry you. My death is certain. Yes, he is going to commit suicide unable to bear failure in love. When did l say that? - Keep quiet. The expression is changing. We can work it out sentimentally. Don't scare me unnecessarily. Go. This is not a joke. Come tomorrow evening at 5:00 near Vandalore level crossing. He will be standing on the tracks. lf you accept then the marriage will take place. lf not, death rituals. Come. Why did you say that? Who am l to you? - Uncle l just did my duty. Uncle, l think it is a foolish idea. You spoke nonsense. Sivaji, we can't make girls understand sensibly. lf you do something crazy then only will it be successful. Why are you talking like a mad person? - Don't talk much. The train is about to come. Do you remember what l had said? Uncle. What, dear? You are notjoking with me, right? Move. lt's very urgent. Sivaji, the train has started. Uncle, she has gone. Then the suicide is cancelled. Come off the tracks. - Go, man. Why are you are chasing the crow? Uncle, my leg has been caught. ls it caught? Remove the pants and run. Are you suffering from gas? - Stop the train. Why are you pulling the chain? A guy is stuck in the track Oh, no! Chain came in my hand. - Oh, no! Stop the train. Stop the train. Stop. Thank God. l won't let you die. Give the car keys. You started it by giving me Re.1 . First business itself is Rs.100 crores. You are very lucky. Your business has not yet finished. Leave him. l won't leave him till this money reaches safely. Uncle, start the car. Do you take me to be a complete fool? Go and see in the old police station records. l am Adi. l am Adi and l'll tear you apart. Why do you bother? We'll look after him. Money should come to my house. The corpse should go to his. Whom did you oppose? They are the top 10 ruffians of Chennai. They'll tear you apart. You made a mistake coming here alone. Only pigs come in groups. A lion always comes alone. There are 8 sacks of English papers. 6 sacks of Hindi papers. - Okay. There are 4 sacks of 'Stardust'(lndian magazine).. ..'Filmfare'(lndian magazine). Keep it inside yourself and take the money. Will it be safe if we keep so much money here? He was my classmate. We can trust him 100 % . For the time being we will have full safety in his shop. Sivaji, we have got enough money. We can open the Sivaji Foundation by giving this. No. lf he alone has Rs.200 crores black money.. ..imagine how much the whole of Tamilnadu must be having. And how much black money exists all over lndia? What do you mean? Have tea. Do you want any thing else, friend? - No, Ayyappa. - Okay. The total value of lndia's black money is approximately.. ..Rs. 20 lakh crores. lndia is not a poor country. They hide it as black money. Look, how much inequality is there because of that. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer. This black money is the reason for lndia's poverty. We will bring out all the black money which is stashed away. We have to open the Sivaji Foundation not only in Chennai.. ..but in each and every district. We have to provide education and jobs in every village. We have to provide food and infrastructure in every village. How can you alone do what the government has to do? l will. First, we have to find out where and those who have black money. How? Make a list of rich people's auditors, accountants.. ..drivers, servants and arrange for a get-together with them. They will never speak the truth. l'll make them say it. - How? For that, we have to go to the government hospital. How are you? - l can't bear the pain. The one who sent us to kill you didn't come to see us. But you've come. You are very generous. Why do you do such work? - We don't know any other work. Son, come here. Do you study? - l put up posters. Why do you choose the wrong path instead of educating the children? Who calls us to do good things? We don't know anything else. l'll give the same job to you. To do some good. Will you come? l'll give you a good income and a house to stay.. ..and education for the children. What do you say? He is calling. Go, man. You are useless. Go, sir. l'll send him. We'll come, boss. l think there must be a discussion about the lndian economy. Why have you called the drivers for that? Thank you to everyone for accepting my invitation. There is nearly Rs.2 lakh crores black money.. ..hidden only in Tamilnadu. What is black money? ls it black in color? What happened? One should pay 30% as tax to the government.. ..from their earnings. lf they hide the income to escape from tax, it is black money. Only all of you know very well about your owners.. ..and where they hide their black money. Legally it should go to the people's welfare association. So please tell us the details of who has the black money.. ..and where it is hidden. Wonderful! Are you asking us to betray our employers? No! - l'm asking you to save the country - How? l am going to spend that money on the people. Why should we tell all this to you? Are you an income tax officer? Commissioner? Or Chief Minister? l am a PM. Postman. l am an ordinary post man.. ..who gives people's money to people. But this is illegal. To keep black money and help in hiding.. .. it is also illegal. My owner didn't steal and rob. He kept the money which he earned with himself. What's wrong in that? Everybody is thinking like this and not paying tax. That is why the government doesn't have money and has to increase.. ..the costs because of lack of finance. What they hide today is increasing the rates of petrol.. ..electricity bills, clothes.. ..medicines and you guys suffer for it. People like your bosses, who evade tax, are betraying the public. Sir. Now l understand properly. Move away. Ask me whatever details you want. l'll answer them. Keep quiet. We can't be dishonest with our profession. l don't think it is right. Whoever thinks it is right to do so, can give the details here. Those who disagree can wait in the office room for me. Get up, let's go. Come. He talks as if he is the only honest person in lndia. lt is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. We should speak up and he'll bask in the glory. The office room is empty. l don't think it is correct. What about you? Will you give information here or will you wait in the office room? We are discussing about that. Cool. l think it is the right thing to do. l was thinking.. ..that l should co-operate in your good deeds which.. ..favor national interest. That's it. Come on! Take this! Just munch this beeda! Run for your life! Wearing a sari! ls it a Sega fight? Sivaji is always right! ls it a Sega fight? Sivaji is always right! Come on! Take this! Just munch this beeda! Run for your life! Wearing a sari! Hello. - Minister. You have black money worth Rs.156.6030 crores.. ..in the form ofjewels.. .. gold coins, green money in Swiss banks and hard cash kept.. ..with someone named Anupam. From that half is for me and remaining is for you. Otherwise it will totally go to the income tax. What do you say? Who are you? - Boss. Who is it? - Boss. Where next? New York. There are many unofficial complaints. Crores of money have been stolen. lmmediately check if any vehicle comes with a big parcel. NEW YORK Material received. Hand over the money to the concerned party. ldentity is Rs.1000 lndian currency. Sr. No. 5EG714592. Friends, split this money.. ..into small amounts and send it to your friends. Tell all of them to send it across to lndia as a donation.. ..to Sivaji Foundation. All this black money will get converted into white. Don't worry, Sivaji. Now we will take care. Yes. - Thank you. Hi! l am Sivaji, buddy. Cool. Hi, Shiv. You got a mail. Wow! The black money we had sent has come back whiter.. ..than ever like a boomerang. We can spend it on the public. No one can question us. We have changed the black money to white money. Now we have to turn the people white who have kept the black money. What do you mean, Sivaji? Won't everyone become white after we get them arrested? Hello, lncome tax office? - Yes. Connect me to the investigation link. You are not leaving a single gap. l have a copy of documents regarding black money.. ..in which people like Adiseshan and Anandam are involved. lt will be easy for you to raid. Send the documents immediately. - l'll send them. Sir. Sir. Who is that? Someone has come to see you. What? - Pardon me. They are.. We are from the income tax department. With whose permission have you come inside? l will call your minister? Sorry, sir. We are from CBl. What rubbish? You won't go to your house alive. We have the evidence that you have black money worth crores. Who gave you the information? l don't know. l know. Sivaji. He has a lot of money with him. Why did you come here and not catch him? He has a correct account for everything. You have not shown the account for all these. Please sign on this? We have to arrest you for the crime of keeping crores of.. ..black money as American dollars. 'Greetings. Today's headlines.' 'Today, CBl and the lncome tax Department..' '..ran a search in the houses of big industrialists..' '..and politicians at the same time all over Tamilnadu.' 'Crores of black money was recovered from them.' 'lmportant members were arrested today for tax, hawala and..' '..foreign dollar exchange crimes. Further investigations are on.' Adi, how did all this happen? Useless guys. They made you come to this stage. What are you going to do inside? Will you break stones, cut the grass and wash the vessels? Shall l get you a job in the kitchen with.. ..a recommendation from the jailer? But you need experience for that. There is a job which can be done sitting.. ..at one place. Will you do it? That is counting the rods. Shocked, aren't you? You have made a mistake, Sivaji. You will have to pay for it. You have insulted me gravely. lt has to be returned. l am very sensitive. l can't bear it. Definitely. l will give it. lsn't what you have got till now enough? Adi.. To your mother.. l pray. Cool. lt has all started from Delhi. l can do nothing at the state level. May l come in? Who is that? Boss. Hello. Who are all of you? What do you want? Who let you in? - Bribe. Hello. - Sir is in the middle of an important meeting. Don't allow anyone for half an hour. - Okay. Sign it. What is it? - Read it. ls it a resignation letter? The place where Sivaji Foundation building is.. constructed is not any residential or government property. So this government orders them to remove all.. ..the objections and start the Sivaji Complex immediately. Signature. A. Kumar Velu. l won't. Sign it. You are showing a knife to a minister. Are you mad? 10000 staff, police at every 10 feet. Will they leave you? Keep the knife inside otherwise.. - Oh, God! You really stabbed me, didn't you? - Was l jesting? You'll get sensible only if you see blood. Sign it. Sign. Will you sign or do you want another experience? - l am doing it. Doctor, you are called inside. - Go, sir. ls it a time to cheers? l thought he was just threatening. But he really stabbed me, Doctor. He always does what he says. Give these medicines. The wound will be healed within a week. This time it was only a trial. lf you open your mouth outside.. ..next time will be the last time. Take care of him. ls it a Sega fight? Sivaji is always right! Greetings to everybody. We will construct stone houses instead of the.. ..mud houses in your village. We'll give education and food to your children in school. We'll arrange for water to turn barren land into fertile land. You've to do only one thing. You should make this village.. ..beautiful with harvests. lf you do as per my advice, within a year.. ..your village will turn from this into this. Move away. On this land with whose permission.. ..are you planning all this? lt is not necessary to get permission for doing good things. This is a government land. For this, you need our permission like 'Tehsildar'(Official).. ..VAO and municipality. No one comes to help in the work. l know very well that you will come to stop it. Applications are ready. Sign them, collect the charges and go on. We don't agree. Look here! Those who wish for the betterment of the village may sign. lf not, just wait in that office room for me. Why should we wait in the office room? The real matter will get settled only in the office room. Come. Come to get it. Office room invites you lovingly. Come. - Thanks. The playground is here.

The decision has been made. From this district.. ..all the jobless people have come whether they.. ..are illiterate or degree holders. You only have to sign on the appointment letter. SlVAJl lNDUSTRlES SlVAJl CENTRE SlVAJl HOSPlTALS Sivaji Residential Complex l was fed up by the time l could get them all bail All the black money is gone. lf the elections come, no one has money. He might've gone away after constructing one college. He was silent. You made him a superstar unnecessarily. He has opened a college in each and every town. He is laying roads everywhere. There are no water problems. He almost runs a private government in each state.. ..keeping an expert team for each department. Tomorrow he might even become the Chief Minister. Enemies are not created. We are the ones who create him. Velu, kill him. Now all the killers are with him. At least put him in prison. lmpossible. He has maintained accounts honestly.. ..without any loopholes. As per law we can't do anything. Do something. lsn't the power in your hands? The office room is in his hands. Whoever goes inside, he straightens them up. He has full public support since he is doing good for them. Notjust that. He came to my office and didn't even spare me. Everything goes haywire. - Then you can file a complaint against him. Then l won't be able to even move outside. l think we can't do anything. What is his weak point? Married couples should always be prosperous. A small gift from us. Be prosperous. - Be prosperous. Bless us. No one can change destiny. But still once go to the temple of Lord Saturn (lndian God).. ..at Thirunallaru and pray to him to his satisfaction. The effect should lessen. What is this? You are very dull on the first night. l am upset after seeing the astrologer. l am very scared. We should first go to Thirunallaru. You are still thinking about the same thing. Today is an important day. We should celebrate it happily. How should we celebrate it? l like your style and action. Let's do something... Only that much? Every Saturday if you offer sesame seeds and oil to Lord Saturn.. ..all the bad aspects in your horoscope will get nullified. Giving oil bath in the Nala Tittha is very special. Are you Bharati? - Yes. ln your school, the Hindi teacher's name was Seetha Laxmi, wasn't it? Yes, how do you know? She is my aunty. We came to worship the Lord. She saw you and wanted to meet you. Where? Here in the temple's office. lt seems you sing very well. Your husband has also returned from the US. - Yes. Sit down. Don't be afraid. Sit down. Who are all of you? CBl. - CBl? See, we are not arresting you.. ..nor keeping you in custody. We won't do anything. We have 4 or 5 questions. That is all. Do you know about the crimes Mr. Sivaji is committing? He has not done anything wrong. Then from where did he get the money.. ..to build colleges, hospitals, factories etc all over the state? Everything has been earned the honest way. No. lt is all black money. The black money which he threatened and obtained. He deceives the government and spends as he wishes. Do you know that the enforce directorate.. ..economic offence department.. .. and the customs and other departments are all.. ..waiting to capture him? Do you know how many rich people, ministers and terrorists.. ..are waiting to finish him off? The police are also waiting to kill him in an encounter. Only you can save your husband Tell me. How did he change the black money into white? l don't know what you are asking. Don't act innocent. You live with him and don't know anything? Don't be rude. Sir, send her with me. l will deal with her. No. No need for third degree treatment. What mistake has she committed? Look here, madam. This is only an economic offence. lf you tell the truth, he'll be arrested and released.. ..in a few years. Else anyone may kill him any time. You decide what is best for him. My husband is very nice. Nothing will happen to him. Okay, madam. You may go. Sorry for the trouble. lf you get any information, then contact me. Hey, Uncle, l have a date with my wife today. There should not be any disturbance. So l came alone. lf there is any work, manage it yourself. Excuse me, sir. - Thank you. What happened, dear? CBl called and investigated me. Are you doing anything wrong? l am doing good work. Tell me honestly. We should not hide anything from each other. Dear, aren't we one? Listen. Hi, l am Sivaji birdie, cool. l'll hand over everything to the people and surrender.. ..when the black money in the country gets over . Switch off, man. Let's get out of here. Wear the seat belt. Cool. Hey, Bharati. What happened? Nothing will happen to me. Go to sleep. 'lt is dangerous to his life.' 'No one can change destiny.' 'Only you can save your husband.' CBl. You've converted Rs. 40000 crores of black money into white.. ..and deceived the government. We arrest you for money laundering crime under FERA Act. Nonsense. What evidence do you have? Your personal laptop computer. Who said that this is mine? Your wife handed it over to us. 'Tell me, madam.' 'Swear that nothing will happen to him.' 'Nothing will happen to him.' What have you done? Have you gone mad? Does any wife hand over her husband to the police? l already.. - Mother, not a word. No one will say a word to her. She has done all this for my sake. Any girl would do just this in such a situation. Till l return.. ..maybe l won't.. ..but no one should hurt her. Forgive me. This is the best chance. Kill him today in prison itself. Else he will come out somehow. lt's impossible, sir. We can open this computer only if he tells the password. He arranged a self destructive program.. ..that the evidence will get vanished.. ..if someone opens it wrongly. Very clever, l must say. Without opening it, we can't prove that he is a criminal in court. Then make him start it under interrogation by any means. Forget colleges or hospitals or mills do not even spare.. ..the latrines built by him. Kill him immediately after getting the statement. lt's a risk if he dies in prison. We'll get caught. After the investigation gets over, under the pretence of.. ..taking him back to the.. ..prison, take his body in the van and stop it.. ..on Kattupattam highway and go for tea. Send hired goons and get him shot. Make it look like they killed him. Sir, l am the jeep driver in the ACP office. l am amongst those whom you helped. My mother was on her death bed. She was treated in your hospital.. ..free of cost and was saved. Many thanks, sir. Be careful. 'On Kattupattam highway stop the van and go for tea.' 'Send hired goons and get him shot.' 'Make it look like they killed him.' Doctor, you have to do a big favor for me. They made a plan to kill me. l can easily escape from here. But if l take the law in my hands, then Sivaji.. ..Foundations will be ruined. There is only one way to save the good that.. ..l have done for the people. l should die before they get a statement from me. l am going to die believing in you and in God. After that, you've to take care of everything. What you've to do, is create a dead body like mine. Vidyabharati, you must be thinking that what the.. ..astrologer said, has come true. My love for you is much powerful than your horoscope. l'll come to you even after taking another birth. Be strong. Lord l did all this to keep him alive. But this is what has happened. Save him, doctor. Please. Come, let us go. Open it. lt's already open. Are you kidding? Seems it opens only if you say something. Say that. l forgot. What happened? Did he say anything? No, sir. Then what are you staring at him for? Beat him up and break his bones. Then he will speak up. Beat him up. Beat him up. - l can't, sir. - Why? My daughter is studying medicine free of cost in his college. l can't beat him up. You beat him up. Beat him up. Pardon me, sir. My brother is working in his mill. l won't be able to beat him up. Tell everyone to go out. Go. Get out. There are many things which l have to return him. One. Two. Three. Why are you counting? l have to give it all back. Only if l leave you alive. Open that computer. Open it. You.. Take this! Leave it, sir. You are beating him up worse than us. He may die without opening the computer. Let him die. He has become unconscious. Please go, we'll take care. Call the doctor immediately. What happened? He is dead. When? How much time elapsed? Doctor has confirmed itjust now. How? He died because of your beating? One second. l am speaking from 'lndian Express' (lndian newspaper). We got news that Mr. Sivaji has been killed in police custody. ls it true? Who said so? lt's wrong information. Hang up. l am calling from 'NDTV' (lndian television channel). Sivaji.. The news has leaked to the press. Who has done it? l don't understand what to do now. How could it happen so fast? He has done so many good deeds everywhere, that someone or the other helps him. Okay, leave it. Take the body in the van and start from there. There is no change in the plan. Faster. Come, let us all have tea. Brother, will this road go to Tambaram? No. - How do l go then? Switch on the oxygen. Oh God, save him! He is finished. Sivaji is dead. Now how are we going to get this computer opened? Sir, so what if he is dead? We can get it opened by someone who mimics him. Who will speak like him? ln our state.. .. there are plenty of super mimicry artists who can mimic anyone. Sir, this is the last chance. Speak correctly. Watch it now. Hi, l am Sivaji. Cool. 'Hi, Shiv. One word is missing.' Which word? l got that one word. l got it. Come here. Didn't l tell you that the computer would crash? So it has happened. All the evidence in the computer is gone. Now no one can attack Sivaji Foundations legally. Don't worry about evidence. We have the government. We'll close Sivaji Foundations gradually, brick by.. ..brick and destroy it. Their boss is no more.. No, sir. Another boss has come up. What are you saying? Some friend of Sivaji's. Arriving from America. An NRl. Now he's going to run Sivaji Foundations in future. He's taking over tomorrow. You are invited. Who is it? Welcome, boss. l mean the new boss. - Thank you. Boss. - Yes. - He is Mr. Adiseshan. Hi, l am Bachchan. Nice to meet you. - Hello. l like it. What do you like? - Your sore teeth. What, sir? He is Sivaji. Sivaji himself. Sir, be quiet. We killed Sivaji ourselves. You killed him and we burnt him. What are you saying now? Something is fishy. How can the dead become alive? Look at this. He is garlanding his own statue. Respects to all of you. l don't talk much. But believe in actions. lt is my duty to continue the good deeds that.. ..Sivaji has left incomplete. Any problem that anyone faces in any part of the country.. ..should be reported to me. l will take care of it. Also those who're behind Sivaji's death won't be spared. l'll definitely get them punished. Thank you. Sir, will you come with us for a while? We need to investigate about you. What investigation? We suspect that you're Sivaji. What did you say? Sivaji? Good joke. Sivaji was my friend. But he is no more. This is Sivaji's death certificate. You saw it and confirmed it. But, sir? What happened to Sivaji? His enemies killed him. - Yes. The entire country says that Sivaji is dead. But you call him Sivaji? lf not Sivaji, then who are you? l am AB Senior. What's the evidence? This is my passport. This is my green card. This is my credit card. This is my international driving license. Legally, we've evidence that Sivaji is dead.. ..and there's evidence that he is Bachchan. Sivaji is Sivaji and Bachchan is Bachchan. Stop behaving like 'Gabbar Singh' (lndian movie character). 'On Kattupattam highway..' '..stop the van and go for tea.' 'Send hired goons and get him shot. Show it like they killed him.' Who? Who is it? Boss. The baldy boss. Why have you come here? To repay. Don't you understand? You killed Sivaji, didn't you? This MMS is enough to send you to the gallows. With this bald head.. ..you can deceive the people stating yourself as Bachchan. But you can't cheat me. l clearly know that you are Sivaji. l am Sivaji and l am Bachchan. As per your plan, Sivaji is dead. As per my plan, l've returned as Bachchan. You are caught. Shocked, aren't you? What do you want? What will you give? Take whatever you want. l will take everything.. ..but after punishing you. How should l punish you? A legal punishment for killing Sivaji? Or should l avenge you personally? l'll ask the coin which you gave me as alms. Legal punishment, if it is tails. My personal punishment, if it is heads. l think you await a new type of punishment. First, a punishment as per the law. lf l click the button, the entire country will know about your plan. No, Sivaji. lf l press, you'll directly be sent to God. l am coming from there itself. Now it is your turn. The cause of epilepsy is the electricity generated in the brain.. Hey, money? l think we'll get back our capitation fees. Slit him. Rs. 10000 more. Rs. 10000 more. Oh no! Just Rs. 1000 more. You couldn't even take this coin with you. Sivaji continued his good deeds! He brought to light many black marketers! Everyone realised the need to eradicate black money! 500 and 1000 rupee denominations were withdrawn from circulation suddenly. Half of the nation's black money came to light! A law was passed that anything costing more than Rs 1000.. .. should be paid for through Cash Cards Cash Cards were distributed like Ration Cards! Black money vanishes fully in the nation Sivaji confessed to the offense of turning black money into white and faced the legal punishment! lndia became a powerful and wealthy nation! Dreams should become reality! and wealthy nation!
