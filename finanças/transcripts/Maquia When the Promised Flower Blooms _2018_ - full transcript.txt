The warp threads are the flow of time. They are dyed by the sky's color as the seasons change. The woof threads are one's calling. They help one stand firm and sways their heart. The people of lorph continue to weave Hibiol throughout their long lives, for hundreds of years. Maquia! Leilia! What are you doing? Once you start playing around, you won't finish work! Hey, get here too, Maquia! Jump on over! I… I can't do it. You coward! Maquia, you don't need to accompany that tomboy. Krim… You really… don't have to. They, who continue weaving away from any humans, are called the Clan of Partings. What's wrong, Madam Racine? It's nothing. You better do it next time, Maquia! Mom! Welcome home! Don't handle the cloths like that! I'm sorry! You're so drenched. Father, did you get some good flowers? Yes. We can get some bright colors with them. Goodbye, Maquia! Goodbye. Goodbye… The threads… Why are you crying? Because I'm alone. Alone? Even though I am here? Elder, that's not what I… You're such a crybaby. Do you know why we are called the Clan of Partings? We, who live long lives with little change in appearance, are creatures from tales of old for those who are not. Until a couple of hundreds of years ago, you can find such beings everywhere. A clan that has wings like a bird's. Flowers that sing before the break of dawn. Giant fish pull themselves in waterways. But, all of them have parted ways from this world. And that's exactly why we continue to weave Hibiol cloth. You'll never be alone as long as you're here. All the memories that encompass the years past is remembered by the Hibiol. Even those who were unable to say goodbye cry with you inside the Hibiol. They're crying with me? But if ever you leave lorph, and have encounters from the outside world, you must never love anyone. Once you love someone, you'll truly be alone. I'll be alone even if I meet others? That is the destiny that we, the Clan of Partings, was given. Good night. Good night, Maquia. Don't forget today's worth of Hibiol. Yes. It bloomed. Maquia? Renato?! That means Mezarte has… Maquia! Go to the Elder's place! Elder! Elder! Elder… Elder! The Renato are armed! Protect the Hibiol! There! Just like the rumors say. There are only kids here. Hey, aren't you into this kind of thing? Stand back! Chief Izor. Who leads this village? I see. It's the first time I laid eyes on one. You might look like a young girl, but I've heard you're actually a 400 year old monster. Our daily life consists of weaving cloth and days, repeated for many times. We do not have time to interact with people like you. You're not the one to decide that. This is the King's order: You are to come with us to the Mezarte Royal Palace. Don't come near Madam Racine! The women! Capture the women! You may cut down those who resist! This guy got the Red Eye Disease…! Leave him! For now, prioritize lorph! Let me out! Let me ou… Maquia! No… {\i1}NOOOOOOO!{\i0} {\i1}Hey, get here too, Maquia!{\i0} {\i1}Jump on over!{\i0} A… baby? A wine made of tears tastes great because there's a hint of salt. You're Maquia from the Elder's place, was it? I came here to buy Hibiol, but got stuck here. This is a settlement for vagrants, but looks like thieves took them out. And this one's just born. It sure is a hassle being a mother. Tried to protect her baby at the cost of her life. Well, if we let him be, they'll be reunited soon. His Hibiol will end here. A teensy-tiny cut you can't call a cloth will be made. Well, that's better than staying here alone. Is he truly alone? So… powerful… Amazing… Come on, stop that. Are you gonna take him? That's no toy at all… He's not a toy. He's my… Hibiol. Good grief. A loner meets another loner. Feeling cold? You smell weird. Smells like the sun. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms Ouch! Over here! - Wait! Lang! Deol! Why are you slacking around? Come over here! - Wait! I won't wait! - Why you… Goodness, this playful brat. What's wrong, Onora? The boobs… The boobs… The boobs… I don't know where they are! Listen here, a child raising a child is totally impossible, don't you think? Is that your child? We can't tell an lorphian's age based on her looks, right? Is it yours? Lang, Deol. I-I'm fifteen… This child… is not. I don't know his age. What's that baby's name? I don't know. How weird. What a weird girl. What a weird baby! Leilia! Leilia… That's a girl's name. Isn't that baby male? T-then… Reiri… Eri… Ariel. Ariel! Huh?! Huh?! Enough already. She's a child of my relatives. And she weaves cloths. There's an unused weaving machine at the back of the shop. You can use that. Wait there. She's from lorph. I'm no match to you, Darel. I hope… Iorph cloths can fetch a high price. I won't expose the identity of such a precious source of income. Thank you very much. Although, she's bare as bones and an lorphian girl on top of that. That's right. I don't know what'll happen from now on. Whether she's here or not. Here you go, today's share. Thank you as always. Your cheese taste different than the rest after all. Not at all! I'll count on you next week as well! Different on second taste! And on the week after that! Even at my age, raising kids alone is so hectic. Do you understand that? My husband, you see, got killed by a Renato that contracted the Red Eye Disease. I don't know. Again with the "I don't know." I don't know what a mother is like. Because… I… didn't have one. It's like this! He walked! That's great, Ariel! Ariel! Amazing! You're amazing, Ariel! You're becoming more like a mama now! Me… a mama? There ain't a mother this unreliable! Have you already finished cleaning the goat shed? Oh no, it's Mom! Let's go, Deol! Sorry, Mom. I'm sorry. Come on, out with your butts. Ouch! Ouch! Try saying "Mama". A lie! That one's a lie! Mama. Ariel, what did you just say? One more time. Say it again. Another Renato has contracted the Red Eye Disease. It has been euthanized quickly. Its remains have been isolated, cremated, and buried underground. We have a total of five still alive. Ooh, how could this be! Mezarte was able to conquer neighboring countries because of these ancient monsters, the Renato. So if they die off, the balance will crumble eventually. For Mezarte to maintain it's authority, we need an existence beyond human comprehension to replace the Renato. T-that's right. We have acquired it. The blood of the chosen! Izor, how's that woman faring? The lorph girl that will be Prince Hazel's bride. Hey, why is it this way? Your kind has wings, yet why can't you fly away from here? Weakling. You are all dying. You are all dying while your bodies burn from all the pent-up emotions you've left burning in your heart. Lady Leilia, you have been called by the King. Give me a bit more time. Lady Leilia, why are you always here? Because it looks like the Hibiol tower. Is that so? I'm done! Was it worded properly? Yeah. "Onora, get well soon!" From where I was born, we use cloths instead of characters to express our feelings. From where Mama was born? Where was I born? Dita's mother said it. Mama's different from everyone else. The place you were born in has these things talking on their stomachs… wiggly insects. They're heeeeere! Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle! Stomachs talk with farts! Onora! Gently put it on him, okay? Good for you, Onora. Onora's been here ever since Mom and Dad got married. He's around ninety years old in terms of human age. Ariel's mom is weird. She's always sneaking around. She's not weird! Mama is… My mom is… I'm… - {\pos(640,44)}He's using boku, a gender-neutral personal pronoun, commonly used by children. - He's still using "I". He's like a child! How spoiled! {\i1}You're{\i0} the weird one, Ariel! A guy who loves her mother is weird. It isn't! I… I… hate her! I love my mom. Shut up! I hate you, Dita! You okay, Dita? This is pretty good. Here's for this month. Thank you. Oh yeah, could you take a look at this? There was someone who brought in Hibiol. What's wrong? At Mezarte's castle, the prince shall be engaged to the beautiful… Lei… lia… Hey, Maquia! {\i1}You can board the boat Darel uses for materials, from what I've heard from him.{\i0} Look, it's that girl. Seems like there are things that aligned perfectly. But what will you do about Ariel? Taking a child to a long trip is harder than what you can imagine. Plus, factoring in all other circumstances. I can look over Ariel here. Mom! Mom! Ariel! Brother, if you bury him too deep, and if… if Onora came back from the dead… Idiot. If it's shallow, the stray dogs can dig him up. Come on. If you place soil on him, I can't meet him anymore. You can always meet him here. If you place soil on him, I can't play with him anymore. Give him a proper greeting. He lived a peaceful and pain-free life. Everyone will come to face this day. It just so happened that Onora's came faster than us. Maquia! I'll go. Hey, Does everyone die? Yeah. Even Mom? Yeah. Maquia! Wait! I said wait! Ariel will… everyone will… meet… that day… way faster than me! Maquia… I didn't not know that… I understand that, but… But… Who cares about the order! Don't cry! Even you, Lang! Aren't you Ariel's mother? Mothers don't cry! My mother is… I'm sure mothers don't cry! I won't cry. Yeah, don't cry. Don't cry. Yeah, I won't cry. Good night. Good night. Ariel! Did you wait for me? Go and sleep on the bed. You've gotten heavier. But… You still smell like the sun. I won't cry. Because I'm your mother, Ariel. Because we'll always be together. Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… Sorry about earlier… If you're looking for Ariel, he's already gone. You okay with not seeing them off? I wanna see the outside! Wait! Don't do it! Ariel! Geez, didn't you promise that you'll stay here and be a good kid! I-I'm so sorry. Maquia? You're alive, Maquia! You're alive… Krim! Mezarte is after the blood of the long-living people of lorph. The village was attacked… and Leilia was… Mom, who's Leilia? You're letting him call you Mom? Ah, no! Letting him call me Mom is… Ah, I'm not angry. I'm not blaming you. It's just that… The Elder always says… Yeah, I haven't forgotten. Then all is good. Tomorrow morning, there will be a parade to celebrate the Prince's wedding. The Prince's envoy emanating from the Royal Palace will cross the bridge to meet with Leilia's envoy that will come to the villa. At this point, we attack the Renato carrying the Prince, causing a ruckus thinning out the security at the villa… and we'll take back Leilia. I'll also watch the parade. I see… Sorry, do that next time. I… I want to go home! Ariel? You're not like Mom when you're here! Ariel. Wiggly bugs… are here! Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle! There are a lot of things here to celebrate this auspicious day! We have now called into the royal family the blood of the lorph! The Renato and the lorph. Ancient legends that remained in the present have now been both obtained by us! We, who have been chosen by the gods, now have no enemy to fear! And with Prince Hazel and Princess Leilia's engagement, a new legend is born at Mezarte! That's…! An assassin? What happened? Leilia… Leilia… Oops, sorry about that! Leilia! Maquia. Why are you here? Krim is also here. Krim? Yeah, let's go! Everyone's waiting for you! Leilia? I can't go. Why? Because I can't run. Why? You're very agile! That's right! You can even jump the castle's high fence… I can't meet Krim anymore. No way… That's just… Lady Leilia! Go on, Maquia! But, Leilia! Go! It's okay! I can jump, can't I? Don't let them get away! Lady Leilia. After them! Wait. If you lay your hands on her, Lady Leilia. I can jump. Has the baby gotten big? He could've been six if he has lived. What do you think of the outside world? You're an lorphian too. Only half though. Racina… The Elder made it a taboo for lorphians to go outside because they would know what fate they will have afterwards. Even if they didn't wish for it, they'll be given weird looks, abused, and eventually become detested and discarded. That's right. The Clan of Partings is an existence always struck by separation. Hope you have a pretty satisfying life. Krim, your wounds… How about you take off your coat? A baby… how? How does one… become a mother? Am I a mother? The things I didn't know were taught to me by Mido. I got help, so it felt like I'm treating him like a younger brother but, it's a little different. I get really happy whenever Ariel smiles. That's why… If Ariel smiles when he's with me, then I'll stay with him… What a weird story. Ariel will die before us. Ariel will make you alone, Maquia. Don't make her cry! That's not it, Ariel! - Don't make my mom cry! Stop it, Ariel! Can you protect them? The things that you treasure the most? We'll stay here in Mezarte to rescue Leilia. You'll get in the way since you have a child. That's why, Maquia, this is goodbye. {\i1}We'll go back home?{\i0} We won't go to our home. What about everyone? The two of us will be going to a new place. By "new place", you mean Mido and Brother Lang isn't there? I'm sorry. That became a full farewell to them. I'm okay as long as Mom is with me! Yeah. I'm okay as long as you're with me, Ariel. No can do. You had a reason, didn't you? You caused trouble and ran away. Had enough of that already! Ariel! We're so sorry! Hey! Wait up! You brat! I'll be going around a bit more, so wait at the room of this inn, okay? I don't want to. Wait here. I beg you. Thank you very much! Our specialty is alcohol so it'll be a nightly job, but you're okay with that, right? Nightly? Any problem with that? My child is, uhmm… still small, the girl who previously quit was also the same. They really don't think too much at this young of an age. Ah, it's different… Different? What's different? That you're not aware you're a mother? Sorry to tell you, there's no one that'll give a job to someone like that. Welcome back! I'm back. Mom, take a look! I made Hibiol… Don't make me do more work. Why did you take this out on your own? Come on, take a look, Mo… Why won't you listen to what I say? Why… Why did you get in the way earlier? If I can't work, we won't be able to eat! Mom… Why are you making trouble for me? Why… The wiggly bugs are here! Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle… Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle… I bought some dinner. Ariel! I'm… no mother. I don't have the self-awareness that I'm a mother. I'm just imitating one, and Mido was there with me, {\i1}you must never love anyone.{\i0} {\i1}Once you love someone, you'll truly be alone.{\i0} True… lonesomeness. Mom… {\i1}Mom…{\i0} Ariel! Ariel! Where did you go? Ariel! Ariel! Mom. Ariel! You got fooled! You thought that was my shed skin, didn't you? Shed skin… She laughed! Ariel! You idiot. Mom? If only you won't get any bigger than this. I don't wanna! If I don't grow up, I can't protect you! Mom cried again. I won't cry anymore! Because I'm a mother! That's a promise. Yeah! Ariel, you promise that too. Yeah, I promise! I'll protect you, Mom. That's it, nice and steady. Here, it's done! Maquia! Coming! I'll make sure you pay your previous debt. What was that? You trying to impress a girl? I didn't say that! Quit messing with me! This angle can only be made through experience alone. That's why I told you to stop, didn't I? I thought it could've gone well though. Welcome! Maquia, three Cherubies! Okay! Ah, right away! Give me some as well. Okay. The lady's got some nice bums! Is that so? Although, you two sure don't look alike. 呐 Isn't it around a year already since you came here? Where did you came from before? There's a rumor where you two being siblings is a lie and that you're a couple that has eloped. Thanks for waiting! Ah, thank you very much. Welcome! More new ones came in. How many lookouts do they need to be satisfied? Well, iron is the sign of the times. Because Mezarte is making cannons like a frenzy, we all get to eat. Although, this seems a bit off. Are they planning to start a war? No way that dimwit Prince can lead the army. Damn right. It's always like this. Sorry for the noise. You may choose from here. Maquia! Lang? It really is you, Maquia! You didn't change at all! That's natural, though. You changed a lot, Lang! How did you grow like that? Don't treat people like they're wheat. Come on, Ariel! Ariel! It's Lang! Brother Lang! Is that you, Ariel? Was it okay to impose myself here? It's okay. Sorry if it's messy. But I'm glad. Are Mido and Deol doing fine? Yeah. But only towns like Doriel have great views. At the countryside, everything's getting old. Even Deol got out of town… Ah, thanks. Did Deol also try to find a job? If not, he won't live. I'll go out for a bit. What, you're gonna go to a date? No, I got night duty. Be safe out there, Ariel. I'll prepare a light meal for you. Ever since we came here and took in jobs, he's been working very hard. I see. I can't sell Hibiol, right? And, because of me, we can't stay in one place. I see… You're right. I'm sure he already knows you're not blood-related. Yes. Around five years ago. From when he said we should sleep separately. He stopped calling me Mom, "hey" and "wait" are all that I hear from him! Must be in that stage. He's a guy, after all. Say, Lang, do you know what happened to Leilia? Another one dead. Burn it to the bones and ensure that the ashes are buried deep underground. I'm scared. It's okay, Lady Medmel. Say, where's my dear Father? Master Hazel is busy. Where's Mo… Lady Medmel? It's nothing? Hair like the moon's color, a golden ring appears in their eyes, and lorphians are said to have hypothermia, but any of those have not manifested in Lady Medmel. No way! If we cannot bear a son that can inherit the throne, then what's the use of having that monster exist? It's been hard for her to be pregnant after Lady Medmel and it seems that both Master Hazel have grown tired of Lady Leilia. My poor Hazel! Do something about it! At least supply her another woman! As you wish. We'll look for any lorphian survivors and make her a replacement vessel. I don't wanna! Lady Leilia! If I have to wear these decorations, if he doesn't want to sleep with me anymore, I should be sent away already! Lady Leilia has… Leave this to me. Another Renato has died, right? Yes. Ever since I gave birth to Medmel, I have been caged up here. I have not met them ever since. I'm sure… I'm the same as the Renato. Vague existences that live only in legends. Even the clan that can take flight, and the flower that sings at dawn, can't live in this world. Surely you can resist. To search for the path to leave a legend. That's rich coming from you. You killed off a legend. Please allow me to atone. Bullshit! Then let me see Medmel! Why won't you let me see her? Isn't she the child I bore? I've… already forgotten her scent. Even the softness I felt when I hugged her. Why… How much more are you gonna take away from me? Is that how much… you want me to become alone? If you don't want me to meet Medmel, Take me to Maquia! Please… The lorph Maquia, I don't want her to become… alone. You've been really elaborate. It always has been the two of us, isn't it? There hasn't been any visitors at our place before. Hey, can you help me out? You've grown again. What the hell. Maquia, we gotta talk. Could you give me some time after you're done? Sure, but I'm still… I'll take some sips while waiting for you. Maquia, go and deliver those now! Okay. I've been holding back since I thought she was your girl. You're right. There's a lot more good guys out there, right? For her to be taken by this bastard… That person isn't like that. That person? You've gotten gloomy. Come on, have a drink! No, I… You aren't a brat anymore, aren't you? Interesting. Then, you can handle this too. Now, time for you to join the adults. Go, go, go, go! If you're a man, Fire up! Slam it! Fire up! Slam it! Hup ho! Hup ho! Hup ho! Hup ho! Heave ho! Not bad at all! Let's go for another round then! Let's become men! They're looking for me? I can't stay at this town anymore. Do you wanna come with me back to the farm? Eh? But… I'm sure it'll work out. The price of goat's milk has gone up. And you're with Ariel. I can't inconvenience you. Maquia. If Mido and Deol got caught up in this, I'll… I want you… to trouble me. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be your strength. I want you to consider it, Maquia. About your future, and uhmm… about us. I think it's impossible to think about it. Ariel's the only one I've been thinking of. How can I live with Ariel? How could I become more of a mother to him? But I can't seem to find an answer. I can't seem to find an answer even now. Because I'm not smart. I want to continue thinking about Ariel… I understand. But, let me help you find a new place and work. Don't shoulder it alone. Ariel? What are you doing? You reek of booze. I'm hooome. Don't say that now! What's wrong, Ariel? Where's my just-got-home kiss? You've always done that back then. I'm sorry. Hey, can you still get up? We've been thought as lovers that eloped. That you're about to be taken by another man. What are you talking about? Come on, stand up! If you're gonna sleep, do it on the bed… Can you walk? Don't step on that! This is… something you've woven, isn't it? I've grown to hate it. Why are you keeping this? You're always treating me like a kid! It has never changed. This is something precious. Ariel! Listen, Ariel, we have to move again. Where do you wanna go next? I'm fine anywhere. As long as I'm with you. I don't… think of you as my mother. Can you put in a word to make me a soldier at the castle? Please. Maquia will be feel sad about this. She's not my mother anyway. Did you say that? Did you say that to Maquia? I did. Do you know what kind of emotions Maquia felt while raising you? Don't be naive! When she was your age now, Maquia was desparately trying to become a mother to you. And you… Yeah, I don't know! Why is that person… treating me carefully? Ariel. Being always there and desperately doing things for my sake are what I thought is what a mother is like. That's why I called her mom. I wanted to protect her. But I can't protect her with the way that I am now. Far from that, I've hurt her. I've realized that feeling. I can't… protect her by myself! You crying like that was no different from when you were a baby. Are you really okay with this? It's okay. I'll do it myself. Aren't you going out of town? I'll see you off, Ariel. Keep safe out there, Ariel. Take care. I'll be going. I won't… cry. I won't cry. I promised. Ariel, you liar. You promised to protect me… You liar. I hate this. Oh, I thought I'd see a real Renato. We can't help it. There were a lot of them before, but now there's only one at the castle. Marching with a papier-mache Renato can't even raise our morale. Oh yeah, did you know? Baiera got their hands on another lorph. Baiera did? Really? Division Commander, stop burning the lice. Shut up! Division Commander Lang! Yeah, we're looking. Apparently, she's a girl that looks the same as Crown Princess Leilia in terms of age. It isn't sure yet that it's Maquia. Are you worried? That person is strong after all. Maquia will be overjoyed to hear that. She's been worried whether you can protect yourself, hence her desperation. In order to make you think she's a mother you can depend on. You're such a brat. I might… be a brat. But I… am going to be a father. Mezarte, O superficial nation, you've exchanged ancient power with political power. Continuing this blasphemy is such foolishness! You must be asking us for our full support. Maquia. The preparations are finally done. Your hair has grown. For an lorph to grow hair beyond her hips, you must be pregnant. Now, Maquia, let's go meet Leilia. Will there be a war? It'll only be painful at the start. Plus, these past few years, you've endured pain beyond that. You left lorph, and everything you had got taken away. Alone inside a cellar as if you're dying… Say, you've finally realized how we felt. Everyone got separated and for sure the Elder isn't alive anymore. We're sad to have lost everything. Meanwhile, Only you have felt happiness… The people of lorph have all weaved the same cloth. Me, you and Leilia, it's not good that we have three different pasts. Congratulations, Maquia. With this, only your past has disappeared. We'll once again weave a singular future. Dita! Welcome back, Ariel! You got back earlier today. I'm sorry I'm busy during these important times. They said there's still some time left. But I'm still worried. Dinner will be served soon. It's okay. Don't force yourself. I'll do it. It's better if I can move around a bit. Come on, sit down. It's almost time. Kinda strange. I looked for a job, went out of Mezarte, met you again, and now… Say, Ariel, are you really fine with me? What? Is it Baiera? It isn't just Baieran ships. There's York's and Endra's too! Ariel, wait! Protect the child inside you! You're late, Ariel. I'm sorry. We've received word that Baieran soldiers have breached the pass. Split into two… How ironic. Mazarte has utilized ancient powers to show off their own. And in reverse, Nazarte, who has abused such ancient powers must be punished. And has resulted to neighboring nations teaming up to fight. Where's the ministers? They have escaped the palace along with their servants. So they have forsaken me? What in the world! It's the end! Goodbye! Your Majesty, let us hurry. Hey, where's Lady Medmel? What a detestable name! We don't need that thing. Leave her along with her mother! Maquia, let's go! Ariel! Ariel! Leilia. I finally found you. Krim? Why? You were alive? Am I… seeing a ghost? I came to get you. From now on, I'll give even more pain to those who have caused you sadness. Then we'll start over again. Wait. I want to meet her. My daughter. What are you saying? She's an unwanted existence you were forced to birth, isn't she? But, I gave birth to her… You can forget her! Your Hibiol doesn't contain your daughter's name. B-but… Krim and everyone died, I thought. I thought everything's gone. That's why I've always thought about my daughter. I want to meet her. I want to embrace her. I somehow got through just with these feelings. Leilia. My… Medmel. I understand, Leilia. Together, let's end it here. Krim! I won't let anyone else… stain our Hibiol any further. Krim! Lady Leilia! Why is it? Leilia and even Maquia… Why? Why has time moved forward? It's just like that day. Ariel! Division Commander! We've received information that an Iorph boy and girl was at Baeira's boat. Did you meet them? Yes. You're done. Leave it to us. Go to Maqui… I'll fight! Are you that loyal to Mezarte? That's not it, right? You're just looking away from Maquia… I am not! That was true at first. But now, I have Dita. I got comrades. And a baby about to be born! Mezarte has been the place I belonged to ever since I got separated from that person. I want to protect it! Are you okay? You're… Doctor! Don't! Not at this time… But… Ariel's… baby! Fire! Fire! Dita. Keep at it. Almost there! You're about to meet your baby! That's it, you're doing great! Dita, just a bit more. Just a little more! Dita! Don't falter! I'm scared… Dita! I'm scared, I'm scared! Save me… Dita, it's okay… - The baby… Save the baby! I'll save her. She'll be saved! It's almost dawn! Time to infiltrate! Come on, the baby's been waiting to come out! You and Ariel are about to become mother and father! You did well, Dita. Mother. {\i1}Are you gonna take him?{\i0} {\i1}That's no toy at all…{\i0} {\i1}He's not a toy.{\i0} {\i1}He's my… {\i1}Hibiol. I see. I see. Ariel, get back here soon! Mom! I'm back! You've become so cold. Welcome home, Ariel. Welcome home, Ariel. A dream… This isn't a dream. But there's snow… That's not snow. It's ash. Your baby with Dita is already born. Don't overexert yourself. It's alright. They're waiting for you. Those two have been waiting for you. So that's how you got born from your mother then. Your mother hugged you so tightly. Her fingers were hardened. I couldn't get you off easily. And one finger after another… Enough already. I… never became your mother. That's enough already! You taught me all: kindness, strength, desparation, the feeling of loving someone… Thinking of you was the same as thinking about me. When I met you, I thought you'll cry with me, that you're my Hibiol. When I'm with you, all the sad and painful things… they all subside. And yet, I… have from you… You weren't a liar, Ariel. You kept your promise. You have always protected me. When we went apart, and I became alone, I lose sight of myself. But when I remember you, I become myself. If you call me, I don't care if it isn't "Mom". No matter what name it is, that name will surely be mine. The one who has weaved me… was you. Maquia! Lang! Could you take Ariel? To where Dita and their baby is. To where Ariel belongs. Don't go… Please don't go! Mom! It's about time we descend, Lady Medmel. Where are Father and the others? I see. That's okay. If I go down, a totally different life awaits me. But even so, I… Who are you? Lady Leilia… You're… My… dear mother… I am Leilia, an lorphian. Tomboyish and always bouncing back, a strong willed woman, and… free. Leilia, fly! I… can fly! No! My dear mother! Maquia. That's right. You can fly too. Farewell! Forget about me! I will also forget! The days I spent in the castle, about this morning, I won't write in the Hibiol! My dear mother… I will forget in my long, long memories. It will be forgotten. That's right… It will just be like a seam! Say, Yes? My dear mother's a very beautiful person. Lady Medmel. It's a Renato! Lady Leilia… We need no Renato. We need no lorph. A destiny where beings of old are disappearing. If that is so, we let them do what they desire at the end. Don't cry, Leilia. It's okay. You won't ever forget. It hurts. It hurts so much. But I won't ever forget… such a beautiful world. I'm back. You came back… Of course I would. She's so soft, it's scary… We gotta decide on her name. Dita? I'm sorry. When we were kids, "Liking your mother is weird"… was something I said. It isn't weird. Your mother is too beautiful and kind I… I'm sure this child… I love you. I do too… But I have always been jealous of your mother… I, who was raised by my mom, will love you. This kid will surely have her own faithful encounter. Together, let's raise her. Me and you, the two of us. This child that will love someone from now on. The Clan of Partings sees off many departures, sees off things that change, time for them continues without end. And that is why, they'll have encounters, will meet, and will weave. Good day. Could you take me to your grandpa? Grandpa? Lily! That's not good! This is where you've been? You're… My mother passed away three years ago. They were such a loving couple. Ever since Mezarte has fallen, they came back here thanks to Lang's guidance. They had hard times, but I think they lived a happy life. Wait, wait! They've talked a lot about you. Both of them, happily. I'm glad you made it in time. My father is already… I'm back, Ariel. You're amazing, Ariel. You've lived your life to the fullest, didn't you? Ariel. I won't cry. I promised… after all. Welcome… home. I'm back. Have a safe trip, Ariel. I'll be back before dinner. Have these! Thank you. Mom! Mom! Welcome back! Listen! Listen! I'm back! Good morning! You got fooled! You thought that was my shed skin, didn't you? Where was I born? The wiggly bugs are here! She laughed! Mama is different from others, they say. Mom, take a look! Come on! Mom, why? You're not like Mom when you're here! Don't make Mom cry! I'm okay as long as Mom is with me! I'll protect you, Mom! Mom… Mom… Mom… Hey, It's okay. I'll do it myself I'll be going now. It's going to be okay. Wait. I know that. What the hell. No, it's okay. I've grown to hate it. I'm back. I don't think of you as my mother. Aah, I don't know! I wanted to protect her. I couldn't protect her. I can't… protect her by myself! Why is that person… treating me carefully? You taught me. Please don't go! Mom! Ariel, I'm sorry. Mom? I'm sorry. I won't cry anymore! Because I'm a mother! That's a promise. Your mom's gonna break her promise… Mom! I love you, Mom! I love you! Ariel… Ariel… Done already? It won't end. As long as I'm alive, Ariel's Hibiol continues on. Please don't laugh at it! The Elder will surely laugh at your face too! Will surely laugh at you for showing her a parting that doesn't only have pain. Hop in. Let's go. A new parting is for another meeting. Elder, I'm glad that I loved Ariel. I'm glad I loved. ちっぽけな星よ chippoke na hoshi yo Oh little stars, まわり続けて… mawari tsuzukete… keep on revolving あふれそうに輝いて afuresou ni kagayaite overflowing with brightness 流れて行く nagarete yuku you continue to flow 綺麗なままで kirei na mama de as beautiful as you are 歩き出す 愛を連れて arukidasu ai wo tsurete We start to walk, taking in our love 奏でるように kanaderu you ni like playing a melody 信じてる どんな形でも shinjiru donna katachi demo I'll believe, in any shape or form 太陽は昇るから きっと taiyou wa noboru kara kitto the sun will rise for sure ちっぽけな星よ chippoke na hoshi yo Oh little stars, 落ちた涙は ochita namida wa your fallen tears あふれそうな優しさを afuresou na yasashisa wo are showing me 見せてくれる misete kureru your overflowing kindness もう一度 笑って mou ichidou waratte smile once again その胸の中には何があるの？ sono mune no naka ni wa nani ga aru no?
