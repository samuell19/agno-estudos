NETFLIX PRESENTS Octonauts, to your stations. Barnacles! Kwazii! Peso! Explore! - Rescue! - Protect! Octonauts! I’m just a tiny speck on a big round planet, in a big blue ocean. And my dream is to live here, on the Great Barrier Reef. It’s the biggest reef on Earth, so huge you can see it from outer space. The Octonauts and the Great Barrier Reef. Pretty cool, huh? And guess what? This humongous reef was built by little bitty guys like me. No. That’s not me. Over here. That’s me. I’m a coral polyp. My name’s Corey. I’m the new kid on the reef. And, whoa! I may be little but I’ll grow If only there were somewhere safe And quiet I could go Hello! Aren’t you a little bit... Small? - Sure, but... - It’s just that you’re a little bit... Slow? Shy? All of the above I’d say. You’re just a little “bit.” That’s it. A bit. - Yeah but... - No buts, Bit. You’d better open up your eyes You’re not equipped with anything To make up for your size Without a shell or tentacles Or razor sharp teeth You’re gonna be in trouble When there’s danger on the reef Good luck, Little Bit. Hope you learn to bite, Bite? But I don’t have teeth. I’m little, but I’ll grow What does that toothy bully know? I’m a tiny Little Bit in the big blue sea I’d be surprised If anybody even noticed me But I can take it, make it If I never quit I hope A Little Bit can find a way to fit - Beep beep. - Look out. Yeah, I’m coming. I’m coming through here. Watch it, kid. - Sorry. - Get out of my way. Hello. I’m new here and... And you could use some advice? Um, well...

Octonauts. We’re getting close to our landing spot for the Gup-W. Oh hello. Um, are you all right? Yeah. But I’m sort of stuck. Don’t worry. We’re about to land, and then we’ll get you unstuck. Tweak, activate Reef Mode. You got it, Cap. - Incoming! - Ah! Peso, meet me outside. We have a passenger stuck to the windscreen. Here he is. We’ll have you on your way in no time. Thanks. Here you go. Nice and easy. That’s better. Thank you. Do you feel okay? I feel fine. My name’s Corey. Nice to meet you, Corey. I’m Peso. And I’m Captain Barnacles. And this thing that bumped into you is the Gup-W. Whoa. I’ve never seen a Bup-Bubble-you. What’s it do? The Gup-W is a mobile medical base. It will help keep the reef healthy and clean. Whoa. Hey Cap. I’ll have the bubble filters working faster than you can say buncha munchy-crunchy carrots. Thanks, Tweak. The bubble filters will help clean the water so coral like you will stay healthy. Ah, hello Professor. Oh hello. I’m just working on the new algae garden. Whoa. Yes, there’s an algae garden to feed hungry fish. Sweet. And there’s a sick bay for any creature who is hurt or sick. - It comes equipped with a nurse-bot. - Hi. - And a Bandage-bot. - Bandage. Wow. I’ve never seen anything like this. I’m totally new to the reef. I’m just a little coral polyp looking for a place to settle down and start building coral. But I can’t seem to find the right spot. I’m starting to think there just isn’t a place for me on this reef. Of course there is. Who do you think built the Great Barrier Reef? Little coral polyps like you, Corey. I bet we can help you find the right location to settle down. Did somebody say location? You just gotta know where to look. You gotta move it along, get snappy Snappy snap snaps the groove Reef living is about location I get location so I gotta move Location, Location, Location Snappy snap to where you wanna be Location, Location, Location - Snappy snap snap with me - And me Location, Location, Location Location - Location - Location So I’m Clovis. He’s a crab. And I’m Laverne. She’s a sea sponge. I carry her around on my back ’cause she protects me. And thanks to his legs I get to travel around to find food. I’m Lamar. - Damar. - Jamar. - We’re worms. - We go along for the ride. Listen. I know this reef like the back of my claw. So let’s snap to it and find you the perfect location. Location, Location, Location Location - Location - Location Location Snap with me. Can we clap too? Why not? Everybody. Location, Location, Location Snappy snap to where you wanna be Location, Location, Location Snappy snap snap with me You gotta move it along, get snappy Snappy snap snap’s the groove Reef living is about location We get location so we gotta move Location, Location, Location Snappy snap to where you wanna be Location, Location, Location Snappy snap snap with us Snappy clappy on the reef’s a must Snappy snap snap with me Location I gotta say this looks like a nice spot. - It sure does. - Very nice. - Lovely. - Looks good. And it’s right next to the Gup-W. We could be neighbors. What do you think Corey? Nice temperature. Clear water. Oh it’s perfect. Congratulations. You’ve found your spot on the Great Barrier Reef. Glad I ran into you guys. Or, uh, you ran into me. Welcome to the neighborhood, kid. We’ll see you round. - See ya. - Bye. - So long. - Farewell. Bye and thanks. Hey Cap, I could use your help with the bubble filters. They’re not working yet. Of course, Tweak. Um, excuse me Corey. Well, enough floating around. Time to settle down and start building some coral. Here I go, go, go. Watch me grow, grow, grow! Oh well done, Corey. Really? How do I look? You look good. How do you feel? I feel… bigger. And if I keep on growing one day I’ll be big enough to be somebody’s home. Well, you’ve made a good start. Let’s give you a check-up. Start by growing in the sand Grow little by little Stretch till you stand Nice and straight now till you’re tall. Big things are built From things that are small. Your stalk is nice and sturdy. And you already have some zooxanthellae. I have zooxanthellae? Is that good? Yes. Zooxanthellae live inside every healthy coral. They help make food for you so you can grow big and strong. Start by growing in the sand Grow little by little Stretch till you stand Nice and straight now till you’re tall Big things are built From things that are small I’ll check on you later, Corey. But for now, just relax and settle into your new home. Peso? What’s that? What’s... It’s a tentacle attack. And it looks like these tentacles belong to… you. You betcha. I’m a mound coral, and these are my sweeper tentacles. I use ’em to attack anything that threatens to take over my space on the reef. Then please stop. We won’t take over your space on the reef. The Gup-W will only be here for a little while. Mm, fine. I’ll back off. For now. But at the first sign of trouble, my sweeper tentacles come out again. I promise we’ll be good neighbors. We won’t give you any trouble, Mister Mound Coral. Hm. We’ll see about that, you little whippersnapper. I’ve lived here a long time. Long enough to know that there’s always some kind of trouble on the reef. Mark my words, I feel it coming Hear my words, I hear it humming On the current, with the tide Trouble I can’t sweep aside Trouble on the reef Trouble, bubble, grief I warn you there’ll be trouble on the reef Mark my words, oh noisy neighbors Hear me, do yourselves a favor On the current, with the tide Comes trouble you can’t sweep aside More trouble creeps this way Trouble here to stay I warn you there’ll be trouble on the reef Emergency. Hurt sea sponge coming through. I’ve been spiked. - It’s terrible. - It’s horrible. It’s not good. Let me take a look. So what do you think, Doc? I need to perform a spike-ectomy right away. To the Gup-W. Good luck. Tweezers, please. Tweezers. Don’t worry. I promise this will be quick. Ready? I’m ready. She’s ready. I can’t watch. Neither can I. I’m not watching. Steady. The spike is out. Oh, that’s better. Better. - Ointment please, Nursebot. - Ointment. Bandage please, Bandagebot. Bandage. Bandage. - Not me. The patient. - Oops. Un-bandage me, please. Bandage. - That’s more like it, Bandagebot. - You’re welcome. Thanks for taking care of my best friend. You know, I can’t survive without this sea sponge on my back. Aww. And where would I be without you? Nowhere. I don’t have legs. Hey, you got my back, and I got yours. We’re quite a team. How did you get spiked in the first place? Well, I was in a hurry sidestepping over some coral… And then all of a sudden I bumped into something sharp and pointy. But I couldn’t see what it was. Did you worms see anything? - No. - Nada. Well, whatever it was, you’re safe and sound now. Kwazii to Gup-W. How’s it going over there Captain? It’s going well, Kwazii. We’re already helping creatures on the reef. Tunip and I are cooking up a little surprise for everyone when you all get back. Ooh, what is it? I can’t tell you, matey. It’s a surprise. Surprise! Kwazii out. Right, when the crew gets back from the Gup-W, we’re gonna celebrate with a special dinner. Dinner! But there’s one thing I’ve got to do first. Let’s see. Three times to the right. Two times to the left. Once back to the right. And... Ha ha. Many a sneaky scallywag would like to get their paws on what’s inside here. Come on, Tunip. Stop lollylaggin’. All right, mateys. In honor of the Gup-W, we’re gonna make something special. And there’s nothing more special than Pirate pie. Pirate pie? That’s right. Pirate pie. From a secret recipe known only by me grandad, Calico Jack. Like I said, secret. All right, me hearties, are you ready? Then listen close and mind ya fins and flippers. For Pirate pie you chop chop chop Yes, Pirate pie you chop chop chop ’Cause Pirate like to chop chop chop At the bottom of the deep blue Chop chop chop Tunip, got any essence of peg leg? Hm, uh-huh. What about powdered parrot feather? Just needs to be a little more powdery. Ready to do some pounding, mateys? Ready. For Pirate pie you pound pound pound Yes, Pirate pie you pound pound pound ’Cause Pirates like to pound pound pound At the bottom of the deep blue Pound pound pound That’s more like it. Thanks, mateys. And now we mix in an old leather boot. Wait, not like that, Tunip. Pour it into the boot and then mix it all up. Just like me Pirate grandad Calico Jack taught me. For Pirate pie you mix mix mix Yes, Pirate pie you mix mix mix ’Cause Pirates like to mix mix mix At the bottom of the deep blue Mix mix mix Mmmm, savor that swashbuckling aroma. Mix in sea glop, sea gloop Leafy greasy kelp soup Deep-sea algae, floatin’ down the line Salt flakes, snot steaks Mistake, tummy ache Come on in, the pie is fine Aye, that’s the stuff. But before we can put these in the oven, we have to add a secret ingredient that me grandad Calico Jack told me never to reveal. I can’t tell you, matey. It’s a secret. But it’s something that you can find only on a coral reef. You keep stirring and I’ll be back with it soon. Dashi and Shellington to Gup-W. What is it, Dashi? Shellington and I are out on the reef. We just found this patch of sick coral. - That doesn’t look good. - Okay, we have your location. I’ll be there as fast as I can. A perfect time for you to test out the Gup-P. Right, Captain. Sweet ride. This way, Peso. Most of the coral around here looks healthy. Except for this patch. The water is a bit dirty. But nothing that would cause this kind of damage to the coral. Then what else could have made it sick? I’ll tell you what. I saw the whole thing. He’s a Watchman Goby. He’s got the best eyesight on the reef. Good for spotting danger. And he’s a blind shrimp. He digs a place for us to hide. We keep each other safe. And you saw what happened to this coral? Yes, I saw three creatures. Three. They had lots of arms. - Lots. - Their arms were covered in spikes. Spikes. They crawled right up on the coral. Crawled. And when they crawled off again, the coral was pale and sickly. Pale and sickly. Does this look like one of their spikes? Why, yes. Hm, that looks familiar. Did the creatures you saw look like this? Yeah that’s exactly what they looked like. What is that, Shellington? It’s called a... Kwazii! A Kwazii? Hi, Kwazii. How’s the surprise coming? It’s coming along just fine. As a matter of fact, I’m out collecting a secret ingredient for it. I see. And what are you up to? We’re about to take this hurt coral back to the Gup-W. How did it get hurt? The creature who did it was covered in these spikes. Shiver me whiskers. I’ve seen spikes in my time In a fin, in a paw, left behind Serving as a clue What leaves a spike In the sandy sea floor? Now I think I know, do you? Some beast from the legends of old And the tales that describe Monsters strange but true Something creepy and crawly And sneaky and spiked A sea monster from the Briny Blue Yikes. I don’t think it was a sea monster, Kwazii. I think it was a Crown of Thorns Starfish. All right then. Let’s try this again. What leaves a spike In the sandy sea floor? Spiky starfish from the briny blue That still gets a “yikes” from us. What he said. Let’s get this coral back to the sick bay. I’ll go with you. Just in case there’s any more spiky trouble. This coral will get better. But it’ll take some time. And what hurt the coral? We think it was a Crown of Thorns Starfish. They’re covered in spikes just like the one that was stuck in Laverne. So that’s what got me? These Crown of Thorns Starfish sound dangerous, Cap. Well it’s perfectly normal to have a few Crown of Thorns Starfish on the reef. But sometimes when the water on the reef gets dirty, more and more Crown of Thorns Starfish appear. That can be bad for the reef. And when there’s too many of them, it’s called an outbreak. Captain, an outbreak of Crown of Thorns Starfish would destroy this reef. Then we better find out how many of them are out there. And fast. Dashi, Shellington, Tweak, you search this part of the reef. Kwazii and Peso, we’ll search the other. Octonauts, let’s do this. Hello, have you seen this starfish? No. Haven’t seen ’em around here. No. Nuh-uh. No. Huh, so far nobody’s seen any Crown of Thorns Starfish on the reef. Maybe they’re gone now, Captain. A-ha. Three trails. And a tell-tale spike. Shiver me whiskers. Cap’n, Peso, you better come and look at this. Flappity flippers. Have you seen a tasty treat Tasty treat, tasty treat Have you seen a tasty treat We’re wanting something yum Have you seen a tasty treat Tasty treat, tasty treat Have you seen a tasty treat We’re rumbling in the tum Wow, that’s more spiky arms than we can count. What kind of tasty treat are they looking for? Coral. Nom, nom, nom. They want to eat the coral? Oh no. If they all march onto the reef to eat the coral, it’ll be a Crown of Thorns… Outbreak! Time to sound the Octo Alert. Octonauts, to the Gup-W. Octonauts, our mission... What’s going on? Yeah, we deserve to know. Yeah. Octonauts and, um, Reef Creatures. We need to protect the Great Barrier Reef from a Crown of Thorns outbreak. - Outbreak! - Outbreak! Crown of Thorns? The Crown of Thorns Starfish will destroy the coral. That’s me. And if the coral goes… - We all go. - We all go. Yeah. - No coral, no home. - No coral, no home. We corals can’t protect ourselves from an outbreak. Even my sweeper tentacles can’t keep me safe from the Crown of Thorns Starfish. We’re doomed. We’re doomed? But I’m just getting started. Now hold on. The Octonauts will protect you. And if we all work together we can keep this reef safe. - But how? - But how? All we need is a plan, mateys. And Captain Barnacles here is the best at figuring out a plan. So what the plan? The Crown of Thorns Starfish are hungry. So we need to give them something to munch on instead of the coral. Something to munch on? Aye, well, that’s as easy as… - Pirate pie! - Pirate pie! Kwazii, I’m sure your Pirate pie is delicious, but what makes you think the Crown of Thorns Starfish would like to eat it? Because of the secret ingredient, Cap’n. Ah, what’s the secret ingredient? Coral slime. Coral slime? Ssshhh. That’s brilliant. Only coral can make... Ssshhh. Coral slime. Crown of Thorns Starfish like to eat coral so they might like Kwazii’s Pirate pie because the secret ingredient is… Coral slime. It’s not so secret anymore, is it? Tunip, how many Pirate pies do we have ready to bake? He says we have eight. We’ll need about a thousand more of them. And fast. We’re gonna need a lot of coral slime. I’ll make some. I think I just made some. Well, that’s a start. That’s very kind of you both. Cap, if we’re baking a thousand pies, we’re gonna need a bigger oven. And some time to cook. The Crown of Thorns Starfish could be here by nightfall. We have to keep them off the reef until those Pirate pies are ready. I’ll just pick those spiky starfish up and move ’em off. Hold on. The spikes on the Crown of Thorns Starfish are poisonous and sharp. They can poke through thick gloves, and if you get spiked, it’ll make you sick. And believe me, it hurts. Better use these grabbers to pick ’em up, Kwazz. But there are too many of them to pick up, even with grabbers. Agreed. We need another way to protect the reef. If we can’t stop the Crown of Thorns Starfish, then maybe we can slow them down until Tunip and the Vegimals bake the Pirate pies. Hm, perhaps a cloud of octopus ink might slow them down. How about two clouds of ink? Or three? Ha ha, that’s the spirit. Slippery snot’ll slow ’em down. I’m a guard crab. We guard crabs may be small, but we’re not afraid to snap our claws at a Crown of Thorns Starfish. - Yeah! - Yeah! And Cap, we could use the Gup-P and the Nursebots to make lots of bubbly water to hold ’em off. Great idea. All right, Tweak, Dashi, Shellington and Tunip, back to the Octopod. You got it Cap. One thousand Pirate pies coming right up. You’re in charge now, matey. Don’t take your eyes off this. The rest of us will stay and protect the coral. Inkling, your team will take the rocks. Ha, our ink should slow them down. Kwazii, you and the spotted guard crabs will hide in the coral for a surprise attack. We’ll give those spiky scallywags a snappy surprise. Peso, you and the Snot Sea Cucumbers will hold back the Crown of Thorns Starfish with a zone of slippery snot around the coral near the Gup-W. They shall s-not pass. And I’ll move out front with the giant clams and the sea squirts. Octonauts and Reef Creatures, let’s do this. Captain Barnacles to Tweak. We’re in position here. How’s it going there? Well Cap, I turned the engine room into a giant oven. Up in the kitchen, Tunip and the Vegimals are adding coral slime to the Pirate pies faster than you can say buncha munchy crunchy carrots. And down here Shellington and Dashi are cooking ’em by the hundreds. Great. All right everyone. The Great Barrier Reef is depending on us. Can you feel the rising tide? Can you smell the Pirate pie? Looking back we’ll burst with pride To say To say That we gave it everything we’ve got Every drop of ink and snot When we tell of how we fought today Today For the reef, for the sea We are standing side by side To protect, to resist When the hungry swarm arrives By our wits, by our hearts By our teamwork And a thousand pies You and I were just in time With a little coral slime What a way to finally find my place My place Calling Every watchman, guard and scout Show your nerve and stow your doubt For the moment we’re about to face To face For the Reef, for the Sea We are standing side by side To protect, to resist When the hungry swarm arrives By our wits, by our hearts By our teamwork And a thousand pies For the Sea We are standing side by side - And a thousand pies - To protect To resist When the hungry swarm arrives - And a thousand pies - By our wits, by our hearts By our teamwork And a thousand pies A thousand pies And a thousand pies Well, Cap, any sign of the Crown of Thorns Starfish? Not yet. Here we come. The starfish are coming. Hurry, tunnel to the Captain and tell him they’re coming. I’m on it. Step aside. Move away. Shrimp in a hurry. Coming through. Psst, down here. Hello there. The Crown of Thorns Starfish are coming. - Coming! - Thanks for the warning. Attention, everyone. The Crown of Thorns Starfish are on their way. Remember, hold your positions. Don’t squirt, slime, snap or ink until you see the tips of their spikes. Tonight we’ll eat the tasty reef Tasty reef, tasty reef Tonight we’ll eat the reef And we’ll have coral in our tums Giant Clams and Sea Squirts, get ready. Set. Squirt. Bubbles! More bubbles! Bubbles are trouble. Good work. Keep it up. Your bubbles will hold them off. I’ll see if anyone needs some back-up bubbles. Time to eat the tasty reef Tasty reef, tasty reef Time to eat the tasty reef Coral here we come Let’s give them the old cephalopod surprise. Ready. Here we come Set. Ink. Here we come. Ink! Here we come. Oh my. We may need more ink. How about some bubbles? Yes. They’re backing off. Bubbles! Well done, Captain. I’d better check on Kwazii. Here we come. Ready? Aim. Snap! I’ve gotcha. Claws bad. More bubbles. - Oh no, you don’t. - Here we come. Come here. We did it, mateys. You’re the bravest swashbucklers I ever met. Kwazii, behind you. Here we come. Bubbles! Right on time, Captain. Well done, everyone. That was snappy. Coral yum, yum, yum. There’s a lot of them. Don’t worry, Corey. We’ll keep you safe. Ready. - Coral yum, yum, yum. - Set. - Coral yum, yum, yum. - Snot! Activate bubbles. Coral, num, num, num. Peso. - Help. - Num. - Corey. - Nom. Nom nom. Ouch. Please… don’t eat the coral. Peso, you saved me. Are you all right? Oh, I’ve just got a couple of spikes stuck in my flipper but, ow. I’ll be all right. You’re the bravest neighbor I’ve ever had. Somebody tend to those flippers. I’ve got this. I can’t watch. You can’t watch? I can’t watch. Neither can I. We’ll see you when it’s over. Ready, Peso? Ready. Steady. You did it, Clovis. You did it. - He did it. - He did it. I could use some ointment please. Ointment. Be right there. Here you go. Oh that’s better. Now all I need is a... Bandage. Bandage. Peso, what happened to your flipper? I’m all right. But, Captain, look, the Crown of Thorns Starfish. - Here we come. - Oh no. Here we go again. Steady, everyone. We’ll think of something. Did somebody order a thousand freshly baked Pirate pies? Right on time, Tweak. Crown of Thorns Starfish. Please do not destroy the reef. Eat it up. Please eat up these Pirate pies instead. Ha ha, it’s time for coral slime. More. Oh, there’s more where that came from. Pirate pies Nom, nom, nom Good work, Octonauts and Reef Creatures. Great squirting, inking, snapping, and snotting. And snotting. Your home is safe. Yeah? Well, what’s that awful noise? Doesn’t sound safe to me. Phew. I finally finished fixing up the bubble filters. They’re all ready to go. Very good. Let’s turn them on. You got it, Cap. Wow, it’s working. The bubble filters will help clean the water on the reef. And that should stop any more outbreaks of the Crown of Thorns Starfish. Our home really is safe now. I can’t argue with that, but I would like a little more peace and quiet around here. Hi, Peso. Hope your flipper’s feeling better. Good as new. And how about you, Corey? I’m growing as fast as I can. Start by sitting in the sand Grow little by little Stretch up and stand Nice and straight now Strong and tall Big things are built From things that are small Huh, look at you. All grown up. Hey, watch this. Psst, little guy, over here. Whew, thanks for the hiding place. It’s my first day on the reef. Mind if I stay here with you for a while? Make yourself right at home. Huh, I tell ya, it’s nice to find a cozy spot like this on such a big reef. Welcome to the Great Barrier Reef. You’re little, but you’ll grow I’ll grow? Believe me I should know ’Cause I was just a Little Bit In the big blue sea I was surprised When anybody even noticed me But I could take it, make it I never ever quit ’Cause every Little Bit Can find a way to fit - Bubbles and slime - And slippery snot Little Bit, Little Bit - Shields of ink - And the care of a bot Little Bit, Little Bit All of us working together is why Little Bit, Little Bit Saving the day was as easy as pie Little Bit, Little Bit Actually, I’d say saving the day was a “snap.” Hit it.
