Scissors. Stone. Paper. Scissors. Stone. Paper. What I'd like to be is invisible. I'd like to be able to move around without having to explain. It's an imaginary country where I go. It has its own people. Can you do that? I knew you would. Billy, why are we so alike? You know I can read your thoughts. Sure. Victory is ours! Listen to me! You've got to trust me. Trust me. I'm sorry to trouble you. We're lost. We've had an accident. How do you feed these pikeys, by the king of kings and the lord of lords? The past, present and future mistakes. And I can look world in the eye and say, "I can live again. "I can breathe again. I don't have to go through the dirty waters "and drink the blood and all that to get a little bit of respite. Running's always been a big thing in our family, especially running away from the police. It's hard to understand. All I know is that you've got to run. Run without knowing why, through fields and woods. And the winning post's no end, even though barmy crowds might be cheering theirsens daft. That's what the loneliness of the long-distance runner feels like.
