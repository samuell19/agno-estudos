You do that tonight and you've had it. Raise your shoulder to your chin. See that, keep your hands up, you keep dropping them. That's it, lead with the left and cross with the right and keep your guard up. Now don't forget, step to your right and keep well up on your toes. Well I'm away father. I've answered the mail and I've made out the checks for you to sign. All you've got to do is put them in an envelope and post them. I'll be in tomorrow to deal with the income tax returns. All right love. - Good luck tonight, Bill. - Thanks sis. Is he going to win, Pa? - Well aren't you coming? - You bet. Jim Bankley's taking me. Who? Jim, over there. Oh. - Well I'll be seeing you. - Cheerio. Well I'm off Jim, will you pick me up at my place? Well look Betty, I'm sorry I meant to come over and tell you I won't be able to make it tonight. What, you're not coming to the fight? Well I hate to miss it but it's a job. A guy I've been looking for for a couple of months, I finally located him. Well must it be tonight? Yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, Bill will be terribly disappointed. We wanted all the people we could in his corner. Well he doesn't need me. He'll be okay, he's good. He'll knock the tar out of the guy. When will I see you again? Well I don't know Betty, I'll give you a call okay? What kind of job is it, Jim? Well I don't know. Look Betty, when I know I'll call you and tell you, okay? I gotta go now. So long Walker, good luck tonight. We've taken all the men we need, beat it. Trident Sporting Enterprises? Yeah, beat it. - Buddy Row Barrowin? - He's busy, beat it. I'll wait. I said scram. That's what I thought you said. Hal. Out. What's all the noise out there? Break it up, will you? This guy's a friend of mine. Thanks for the friendly reception, Buddy. Oh these guys got muscles in their heads, when you'd get over here kid? A couple of months ago. Good to see you, come on inside. Oh, this is a great surprise. Oh look honey, I'm kinda busy right now. Why don't you go, I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Make yourself comfortable, I'll fix you a drink. Or are you still keeping your body beautiful? Well I work out at a gym once in awhile but I'll take a drink. Good. Now what took you so long finding me? Man you don't advertise, you ain't easy to find. Well it's good to see you, Jimmy. What have you been doing here in England? Looking for you, mostly. You're the guy that didn't want me to go back to Canada in the first place. "Stick around," you said, "The place is wide open." I got sick of working for a living anyway, so here I am. Well yeah but that was a couple years ago kid, things are different now. No rationing, no black markets, no black markets, no rackets. - Well what are you doing? - I'm doing all right. Don't tell me you were working. Don't you worry about me, kid and don't worry about this office either. It's strictly a front, Rico does pretty big business. - Yeah, who's Rico? - Rico Francesi, he's a big boss. Yeah, what's his game? Plenty. You suppose he could use me maybe? Maybe, What are you doing tonight? What, you know a couple of women? Women huh, you never change do you? Well Rico happens to hang out at the dog track most evenings, I thought I'd take you down and let him look you over. Come on, let's go. Hey what about my pants? This guy tore me pants. So you can sew, can't you? Audrey, what would you like to eat? You like spaghetti, yes? Good, Bella? Si, spaghetti. Good, three spaghetti and tell the chef very particularly I want it with meat sauce and garlic but don't bring it out until I tell you, okay? Good, Joe? The results of the fourth race. There's Rico over there now. Buy a drink first, hey mate. Hello. - Two beers and water, please. - Yes sir. Who's he? That's Mick Conrad, he works for Rico, bad boy. My dog's in number six, to win on three legs. There are two on the passing lane but not yet. Phone the bets off the track. Spread the word around number six is no good. Tell the boys to bet on number three, that way we lengthen the odds on number six. Tell them I'll cover anything they lose on number three. Okay, Rico. Hello Buddy, it's the three dog, six is no good. It's the three dog, track six is no good. Who's the gal? That's Audrey, Rico's latest blond. No, the other one. That's his sister Bella. You watch it, you wait here, I'll go talk to him. Hi Rico. Hello Buddy, we are betting on number three. Good, I got a guy here I want you to meet Rico. - Who is he? - He's a friend of mine. We were in the Canadian Army together. He's pretty good with his fists. You know I don't need any more muscle men, Buddy. - This guy's got brains, Rico. - I don't need that either. But look he's an engineer, a telephone engineer. I thought maybe with his- All right Buddy, not now. - Which one is he, Buddy? - The kid in the windbreaker. - I like him, bring him over. - Bella, you know... Bring him over. 29 and 19. Jim Bankley, Rico, Mr. Francesi. - Good evening. - Hi, Mr. Francesi. Buddy tells me you're some kind of engineer. What experience you got? Army Signal Corps and I worked for the Bell Telephone for awhile. He also says you're a fighter. I can look after myself but I don't go looking for trouble. Neither do I, that's good, I like that. Are you looking for a job? Maybe. Can you do what you're told? Well that depends on who tells me. I've spread the word on three, we'll have a nice ride on six. Would you like a tip for this race? - Sure. - Number three. Number three? Do yourself a bit of good, go on. Like you say, Mr. Francesi. I suppose you want to eat again, yes? Again, what do you mean again? It's seven hours since we had anything. Okay we eat now, waiter? Bring the spaghetti. Hello. Hi. - Did you win? - What do you think? You see, he does what he's told. How much did you lose? Five pounds. Okay, I'll cover it for you. Go on, take it. Come into the office tomorrow, I'll give you a job. - Thanks, Mr. Francesi. - Okay. Is that what you want? - Hello? - Betty, Jim. Hello Jim, did you get the job? - Yeah, I got it. - What kind of job is it? Well just working, you know. I'll explain later. Look Betty, I won't be comin' down to the gym for a couple of weeks. You know how it is getting settled into a new job and that. Yes, yes I know how it is, will you give me a ring? Sure, I'll call you Betty. Yeah, bye now. Bye Jim. Look, what's the game? Last week I had me barrow tipped over the main road. What do I pay protection money for? Well you missed a couple of payments. Well I pay you to look after the pitch, what more do you want? You know what we want. - I know what you want. - Well? More regular payments. - Morning, Mr. Francesi. - Morning men. Sam, McLeod in? Yes boss. I want to see him. Come in. Yeah McLeod, it was fixed for Walker to lose the fight last night, what happened? Well I told him to lay down and he said he would. I suppose he changed his mind and decided he'd try and win. He did too, didn't he? Some dumb fighter changes his mind, so I gotta lose a lot of money, I get ulcers. Who is his trainer? His father. Maybe you better go see the old man. Tell him if he wants me to get the boy any more fights, he's gotta do what I say and McLeod, this time no trouble, you understand? Everything nice and quiet and polite, okay? Can I take the new bloke I saw you with last night? What's the matter, you want an escort? You talk good English, go by yourself and McLeod, no more trouble. Hello? Yeah, speaking. Uh-huh, and the new ones? Two seconds off huh, that's pretty good. Okay I'll see you tomorrow, goodbye. Excuse me Mr. Walker, could I have a word with you? - What do you want? - Well it's, it's sort of confidential. All right. Break it up, boys. Come in here. What happened, Mr. Walker? What do you mean what happened? Well I thought your boy and me had a little arrangement. I don't know what you're talking about. Now look, don't get excited. Lots of good boys go down when they're told. - Not my boy. - At the right price. - Get outta here. - Now you're being silly. I'm here on a friendly basis. We don't wanna see your boy get bashed about now, do we? You're not worrying me, tell that to your mob. No mob, I'm here on me own account. I know who sent you, Rico Francesi. Now you've got it all wrong, Mr. Walker. Rico wouldn't let that fly. Outside. Next time he lies down. I'll give you just five seconds. What's all this, trouble? He's trying to frighten us, Bill. He says that... What happened last night? I'll show you. Look out. Stop him. Don't let him get away. What do you think Bella, it's all right yes? Rico, I think it's a little tight in the shoulders. Maybe you're right, you'll fix that for me and look here, I'm getting a bit of a stomach. Too much spaghetti, you make the jackets so it covers it up. Hello? Yeah. - Sleeves, sleeves okay? - Sleeves are fine. - Not too long? - Wait a minute. Hey Rico, trouble. Hello Rico, it's McLeod at the Edison. I've made a mess of this job. Well he threw a punch at me, so I let him have it. You fool McLeod, why can't you do what I tell you? Didn't I say everything nice and quiet and polite? That fool McLeod, he slugged the Walker boy. How bad is he hurt? Buddy, get rid of McLeod, I've had too much trouble from him. I don't want to see him around here no more. Police. You ring me back. Here we go again. Buddy, give me my jacket. Good morning Inspector, what can I do for you? And Buddy, show him out. Sure. This way please. Well? A man named Walker has made a charge against you. He says you sent a man down to intimidate his son. This man hit the boy and killed him. I don't know anything about this. Who is this guy I am supposed to have sent? His name's McLeod. McLeod? Oh McLeod, I've got nothing to do with him. Oh sure I know him but I fired him months ago. I haven't even seen him for I don't know how long. We'll see what he has to say. - You know where he is? - We know where to find him. Do you mind if I have a look around or do you want a search warrant? No, I've got nothing to hide, help yourself. Come in, Mr. Walker. Do you recognize anyone here? Nope. All right come on, let's go. I know him. Hello Mr. Walker, what are you doing here? - Who's he? - I've seen him around my gym. - Who's he? - I'm a police officer. And so? There's been trouble at Mr. Walker's gymnasium. His son was beaten up and killed. Bill's dead? What do you know about a man called McLeod hmm, McLeod? McLeod, I never heard of him. - Where are you from? - Canada. - Got your papers? - Sure. Look, what are you knocking me for? A man has been killed. So what's that got to do with me? Copper, why don't you leave him alone? He's told you he don't know nothing. Sit down. You better get home, Mr. Walker. I'll be in touch with you. Say Mr. Walker, I'm sorry about Bill. - Leave me alone. - Okay. I just want you to know if I could help, I would. You can't help, leave him alone. That's punch-drunk idiot McLeod. I don't know why I didn't get rid of him before. Rackets are one thing but killing is something else. What are you worried about? We had nothing to do with it. You don't understand, that doesn't matter. Collie has been waiting to fix something on me for a long time, even something I'm not responsible for. Now we are just sitting on dynamite. When they pick up McLeod, he shoots off his mouth and... You could have someone shut it for you, couldn't you? - No Bella. - Permanently? No, no more killing. Hello, yes? It's McLeod. Crazy fool, lunatic, do you know what you have done? The boy is dead. They have already been here. No, no McLeod, no more money, not from me. Okay. Okay I'll send it to you, I'll send it with Buddy. Don't give me orders, McLeod. All right I'll send the new boy, where are you now? You're even more crazy than I thought. Go find some people, lose yourself in a crowded street. All right, Barrick Street in half an hour. He wants money. What are you gonna do? Send it to him, what else can I do? I gotta buy some time. My way would've been cheaper. We could've sent Buddy and- I said no. Anyway, McLeod's already thought of that. He wants me to send the new boy with the money. He knows the new boy has never even seen him. Oh, well what about the new boy? He knows the Walkers, doesn't he? Yeah. I've gotta do something about that. Buddy. Yeah? It's McLeod, he's been on the phone. Where is he? He's hiding, he wants money. That's fine, why don't you let me give it to him? No, not about that, anyway he's already thought of that. He wants the new boy to bring it. - Well what do we do? - Send it to him. - No, look... - He knows too much. Did you know this boy you brought in last night was friendly with the Walkers? Well how would I know that? I'm no mind reader. All right but warn the boys, not a word about McLeod. - Anything else? - Yeah, send him in. All right. Jimmy, the boss wants you. - Hmm? - It's Rico. Too bad about that boxer, huh? I knew him you know, I used to spar in his gym a bit. Nice guy, kinda tough on the old man and the girl too. Yes, very sad thing. Say, what'd that cop come up here for? Pay no attention to that. Always when there's trouble they come to me. You, what's your name? - Jim Bankley. - Jim. I want you to go deliver this to a friend of mine. - Okay, where and when? - Barrick Street half an hour. All right, how will I know him? You won't, he'll know you, just walk around. - Yeah but what if- - Nevermind, just go. Okay, Mr. Francesi. Barrick Street. You know where that is? Yeah, I'll find it okay. You comin' this time too, Mick? - Jim. - Hello Betty. I just heard about Bill. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am. - Come in. - I can't stay long, Betty. How'd you hear about it? I just saw your father, he told me. Where is he now? He was with someone from the police force, he went with him. Betty, what was it all about? I just can't believe it's true. Father saw the whole thing, it happened right in front of him. Why would anyone want to kill Bill? Oh I don't know, something to do with him winning the fight. I get it. What are you doing here? Get out. Father, why? He works for the Francesi gang. - Jim, it's not true. - Well Betty I... So that's why you wouldn't tell me about the job. McLeod works for Francesi. Where is he? Look Mr. Walker, you heard him. There's no McLeod working for Francesi and that cop you were up there with, he just has it in for him, that's all. Believe me, he's knocking on the wrong door. You young fool, you don't know the mess you've got into. My boy's been murdered. And I'm sorry, Mr. Walker. If I could help, I would. Betty, I have to go now. You're trying to roll this thing thinking of nothing but yourself, self, self, self. Yeah self, if I don't think of myself, who's gonna, you, anybody? Let me tell you something, Mr. Walker. I didn't know what a square meal was until I went into the Army, then I had to fight for that and boy, that's just about it, you have to fight for everything. Betty I'm sorry, I have to go. You've got something for me? - Who sent me? - Francesi. - Well here. - Took your time with that, didn't ya? Do you mind? Hello. You did that nicely. There wasn't much to do. You do what you're told, I like that. Is this an accident or were you watching me? Like a mother, do you mind? No, I'm in accord with mothers. What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. - Wanna go for a ride? I have a car parked around the corner. - Sure. - Come on. You're not very talkative. Huh? How well did you know the Walkers? Oh I just knew 'em, I've known 'em for a couple of months. Did the boy happen to have a wife? No. No. He only had a sister and a father, that's all. Is the sister a pretty girl? Yes. You don't seem very happy, what's the matter? Oh I'm sorry, I just can't seem to get over the way that kid was killed, that's all. Yes, it was terrible. But look, there's no use being miserable about it because what can you do now? I guess you're right. - You like it? - Nice. - And where do you live? - Not so nice. Nevermind, you're a clever boy, you'll get ahead. One of these days you're gonna have lots of nice things. I intend to. Mr. Francesi? Don't worry, he has his own place. - Not worried just interested. - Would you like a drink? No. You know I like you. If I didn't, you wouldn't be here, believe me. If I didn't like you, I wouldn't have come. We'll have to do something about some new clothes for you. Now there's something else I like. And something about your manners too. Soda? Yeah. Lesson number one, yes please. Yes please and thank you, Miss Francesi. Aren't you gonna ask me about me? Why? I got a lot of good stories, anyway you don't know me. I will, we have lots of time. Are you married? Uhuh, never been, you? - No, not now. - Oh divorced, huh? No, he's dead. - I'm sorry. - I'm not, I'm glad. - Glad, was he that bad? - I hated him. I was married when I was 16 when I was in Sicily. Anyway let's not talk about that, that's all over with now. - Oh, you're from Sicily huh? - Mm hmm, I'm a Sicilian. Heard about them, swipe your teeth and you leave your mouth open. - Have you ever been there? - No. It's a beautiful country, it's warm, it's sunny. I'm going back there someday. What did you come here for in the first place? My brother. It's nice up here, isn't it? Yeah, I like it. That's why I bought this place, because of the view. Isn't the river beautiful? You've seen one river, you've seen 'em all. What's the matter with you, haven't you got any romance? Yeah but a river ain't my idea of it. - What is? - Are you asking? Maybe. Lesson number one. You've got a lot to learn but you're a bright boy. Can you get me a cigarette over there? Ouch. How well do you know this man, Jim Bankley? I've known him now quite a bit, he comes to father's gym. But he's got nothing to do with Bill's death. No, we know that but he may be able to tell us where McLeod is hiding. I don't believe it, if he did, he'd turn him in. Maybe he wouldn't. What do you mean? Jim Bankley joined Francesi's gang the day your brother was killed. Now listen Inspector, Jim may be a bit wild but he'd never shield a murderer. How do you know? Well I know Jim. How much do you know about his background? - Not much. - Exactly. What do you want me to do? I want you to meet him, continue your friendship. Go on out with him, talk to him and see what you can find out. Suppose Jim does know where McLeod is hiding. Why should he tell me? Well that's up to you, will you try? I don't even know where he lives. Well we know that all right but that's not the way. No, I want you to meet him casually. Do you know anywhere he frequents, anywhere he goes? Well there's a little espresso bar in Soho he goes to most mornings. That's just the sort of thing, try and meet him there. Now this is what I propose you do. - What do you got? - One minute 52. It's a cinch. What do you think of his chances at the Ripon next weekend? Never get Within a mile of him, Mr. Francesi. Good, all right take him back to the stables. I'll call you later. You're not gonna run him at Ripon are you? I don't know yet, maybe. But if I do this time, I want a good price. It's gotta be at least 10 to one. How you figure to get those odds with the kinda dough you wanna lay? It can be done. Tell me your friend, what's his name? Jim. What does he really know about telephones? He's a regular little Alexander Graham Bell. Hey Jim. What do you think of my horse, Jim? He looks like a rocket. You should make a lot of money with him, Mr. Francesi. Well I don't know, these days it's pretty difficult to make much money on racing. There are too many crooks, you know? Well you can outsmart the best of 'em. Tell me, can you tap a telephone line? Yeah, sure. Jim, you've got a horse like mine, you know he's gonna win, what you gonna do? Me, I'd bet my shirt on it. But if the horse carries a lot of bets, the odds are shorter, no? Well I don't know that much about horse racing. I see, well I'll explain it to you, it's like this. The book makers and their offices on the tracks, they've got a private telephone line between the two. If somebody bets a lot of money, they phone each other, the odds are shorter. So if the horse wins, you get less money. That's easy enough, I get it. But I don't wanna get less money, I wanna get more. You think you can maybe make me some kind of a gadget to cut in on the telephone wires so the people on the other end wouldn't know about it? Sure. By next Wednesday? Well that isn't much time but I could try. Good, I'll give you more details, come on Buddy. Bella, come and give me a hand again will you? Look can't you finish it tomorrow? I'm tired. No, I've gotta finish it tonight. What do you want me to do? Talk into that, will you? What'll I say? Anything you'd like. Okay. I love you. And again. I love you. No, it's no good. Not enough distortion. You weren't even listening, were you? - What do you mean? - I said I love you. I heard you and I love you too. Say get that iron again, will you? Maybe we can get this fixed up. Hey watch it, you burned my wrist. Did I? You know, I think you did it on purpose. Now hold that again. Hello Betty. Hello there. How are you? Fine, you? You know. - You want a cup of coffee? - Please. Can I have another cup of coffee here, please? You followed me in here, why? No. I just wondered how you were getting on. I'm doing fine. How's your dad? Oh, he's pretty broken up. Bill was his whole life you know. He had a great future planned for him. Yeah. Listen Betty, I am sorry I talked to your dad the way I did. That's all right, I understand. They found this McLeod guy yet? No, they don't seem to be getting anywhere. Don't worry, they will. Are you expecting someone? Yes. How's the job going? Okay. What sort of job is it, Jim? Just a job. What sort of things do you do? Bet on dogs and horses, hang around the racetracks mostly. Jim, this Francesi has a very bad reputation. I'm afraid you'll get into a lot of trouble working for him. I can take care of myself. But you don't know anything about him. Listen Betty, Francesi's a gambler. He bets on horses and he bets on dogs. There's no law against that in this country. - What about his gang? - Well what about 'em? I know every one of them. They're just a bunch of punch-drunk mugs. What about McLeod, wasn't he one of them? Now there's something I've checked on. There has never been any McLeod working for Francesi. Listen Betty, I liked Bill. Do you think I'd cover for his killer? No, no I don't think you would. What about the police? What about 'em, they talk to you about me? No. Okay leave me alone Betty, I know what I'm doing. Excuse me. Bella. Sorry I'm late, darling. That's okay. Did you get the part you wanted? Yeah I got it, I think if I work on it tonight I'll be able to finish it by tomorrow. Good. Miss Walker, sir. Come in Miss Walker and sit down. Thank you. How did you get on? Well I managed to meet Jim, Inspector but I'm afraid there isn't much to tell you. - What did you talk about? - About Bill mostly. Oh look Inspector, I am absolutely certain Jim knows nothing about McLeod. He's tried to find out on his own and nobody knows anything about him. Mm hmm, I see, did you find out anything about himself? This job of his, did you find out what it was? No, he wouldn't talk much about it. Something to do with Greyhound racing I think. Did you find out anything else? No, I didn't. Did you arrange to meet him again? I didn't get a chance to. While we were talking, a girl came in. It looked as though he was expecting her. Dark girl, called her Bella. Oh I see, so that's the way the land lies. - You know her? - Yes, yes. That's Francesi's sister. Oh. Do you want me to try and meet him again? No I don't think so, I think we better drop the whole plan. I don't think we'll get anything more out of him now. Anyway, thank you Miss Walker for trying to help us. Sergeant, show Miss Walker down will you please? If I were you Miss Walker, I'd forget all about Jim Bankley. - Hey Buddy. - Yeah? How many times did I tell you the spaghetti should have meat sauce, not tomato sauce? I'm sorry Rico, I only ordered it, I didn't cook it. Sam, telephone Reba my teller, tell him it's getting cold. I want some of the materials down here soon. And garlic, there's no garlic, you know I like garlic. - You do but nobody else does. - What? Phone ringing. Hello, yeah Rico speaking, who is that? Oh hello, yeah. No no, there is no goal to meet. No, I haven't handled that stuff for years. Okay I'm sorry, goodbye. Sam take this away, it's no good. Already it's 1:45. I told that boy he should be here at 1:30, where is he? Give him a couple of minutes, he'll be here. I don't like people to be late. - You're late, what kept you? - I did. He should have been here at 1:30. It's all right, he's here now. Okay, show us what you got. Bella, I got this morning from home photographs of Aunt Maria's children, so beautiful, I'll show you later. Are you ready? Yeah. Now say the line between the track and the bookie's office runs through here. That's the track, that's the bookie's office, now go ahead. - Hello, Rico? - Yes, Rico speaking. Who is this? It's Buddy. That's good, now can you hear okay? - Sure. - Yes, it's a bit distorted. Good that's what we want, I'll explain why later. Now when we're ready to operate, we tap the main line, connect it here and here, throw this switch, then cut the line. Now the bookie and the track are still connected but only through us, now here's where we come in. Our boys are connected up here. When we're ready to cut in, we throw this switch and one of our boys is connected to the track and the other one's connected to the book. Yeah but won't they recognize our phony voices? No, that's why I put this distortion in. That'll take care of that, they won't recognize you. Well I don't get it. Look, track, bookie's office. We think we are speaking to each other but no, you are speaking to him, you are speaking to me, see? So we can tell the course any odds we like. - Well that's real smart. - You got it. All right Buddy, explain it to them. Say Mr. Francesi, what if your horse doesn't win? Don't worry, I've arranged that. Now look fellas, right here, that's the spot where the blower wires leave the main road, connect up to two independent telegraph posts and go into this field here. Switch on number one. Switch on number one. Okay. Now. Stand by, three more minutes to go. Motorcycle cop. You having some kind of trouble? No, we're just testing the line. - Ah, lovely day. - Oh sure. Fred Tom. Fred Tom? Yes, you're from the Redding job aren't you? Oh no, we came up from London, we're on a special job. Oh. Tom's a friend of mine. Yes, from the Redding job. He promised me a length of copper wire for my wireless aerial, haven't got a bit in the van have you? No no, we only have what we need for this job here. I only want 50 feet. I'm sorry, we don't have it to spare. Okay, it doesn't matter, it sure is a lovely day. Are you American? No, Canadian. Canadian, ah Canada, there's a place. I was out there during the war training, Air Force. Do you know Vancouver? Yes, do you mind excusing me? I have something to do right now. Sure yes, I'm in no hurry, nice to have a chat. We'll never make it. A funny thing happened to me when I was down in Vancouver, I must tell you about it. We were out there one night and a couple girls... It's my lucky day, 30 mile an hour speed limit here. - Okay. - Switch on. - Past Western. - Two and two. - Two and two ends. - Okay. How far is Western now? No, not yet. Put him up there with Big Ed.

Alaska by half a length, and the return price? Thank you. 10 to one. Well like I'm telling you see, it was a real hot day, so I go into this little bar on West 41st Street. I get myself a long, cool beer and I'm watching a ballgame on television and suddenly I get the feeling I'm being stared at. You know what I mean. And right now it's suddenly coming to me. You are the living image of a cousin of mine I haven't seen since I was a kid. His name is Mark Geravero. - It's getting late, huh? - Okay. Sam, will you get Bella's wrap? And Rico, I think we'll go, it's been a long day. Sure. Listen, will you telephone me tomorrow? - Well yes, I will. - All right, fine. - One for the road, Jim? - No thanks. I'll carry it, darling. I'll come to the door with you. - It was a nice party, Rico. - It was my pleasure. This weekend I think we close up the office, we all go away somewhere, yes? Jim, you did a very good job for me. Here's a little present for you. Okay, so I give it to somebody for Christmas huh? But some of this you can always use, yes? Thanks, Rico. - Goodnight Bella. - Goodnight Rico. It's my call, you show yourself out yes? See ya. Hello? Oh yeah. Yeah, thank you very much. Oh sure, I've got the money right here. You pick it up anytime you like. Okay. Goodbye. McLeod. Wait here honey, I'll get the car. Okay. Buddy! - McLeod. - Let's go. - Stop him. - Rico! Stop him. Stay there Bella, I'll get him. Where was he? He got away into the warehouse. We'll find him, come on, follow me. He went over that wall there. Sam, over the wall, get this door open. Hey Rico, why bother about him if he's just a cat burglar, huh? Hey, what's going on here? All right, get him inside, let's go. Rico, we're wasting our time. That guy's migrated by now. He's in here somewhere. Buddy, Jim, you look that way, you two, you come with me. Come on. - Hey there he is up there. - Hey Rico. Head him off, we'll go around the other way. He can't get away now, we got him. Grab him and we'll let him down from here. You shouldn't have hit Bella, McLeod. - McLeod? - Cut him down, Rico. Cut him down. Cut him down? - Get me something. - The ax. Rico, you know what you're doing? It's murder. Hey Buddy, get off. Cut him down. - Don't do that. - I said cut him down. You're crazy. Get out of here. Come on. Let's go Buddy, this way. What if it's not clear? That's a chance we gotta take. It's okay, it's clear this way. We'd better make for Rico's. Not me Buddy, I'm gettin' outta this whole lousy mess. You're crazy kid, Rico will never let you rest. Wouldn't he? Listen if you were smart, you'd do the same thing. No Jimmy, I never steered you wrong. So what's the matter with you, Buddy? Why didn't you stop him from getting killed up there? If you had guts in the Army, where are they and why didn't you use 'em? Yeah I was a hero, so where did that get me? I feel sorry for you, buster. Now look. What are you doing? Jim, what are you doing? There's a question, I'm leaving. You're leaving, why? You don't know? Boy, I'm sorry I ever looked Buddy up. What do you mean Buddy? Who do you think brought you into this gang anyway? I gave you the chance because I thought you were a man I could make something out of. Now stop all this nonsense and quit being a fool. Thanks for the chance Bella but it's not the kind of chance I want, we don't think the same. So you think you can go along for the ride and jump off when you feel like it, huh? Try stopping me. What's the matter with you, Jim? I'll tell you what's the matter. Making a fast buck is one thing but murder is another. Now why wasn't I told about McLeod and the boxer? Because you thought I wouldn't buy it? Well you're right, I won't. That was an accident. We didn't want McLeod to kill that boxer. Accident? What I just saw now was no accident. It was cold blooded murder and I don't like it. Now look Jim, you can get upset about a thing like that. Rico had to do it, McLeod would've finished it. I tell you it was McLeod or us. Rico wouldn't a cut that boy down like that. You made him do it, it was you. I was there, remember? Look, it was just like squashing a fly. I tell you it was him or us. He was a human being Bella and he didn't have a chance. Boy, I've been a 14 karat sap but suddenly I'm getting smart. I'm leaving you, I'm leaving it, I'm leaving everything. Jim, wait a minute. What about me and what about us and what about what we have together? You don't walk out and find that anyplace... There's nothing Bella, nothing. You don't leave me, you don't leave me. Nobody leaves me, I walk out when I'm ready and you don't go until I tell you to. Your mind's warped, Bella. Hell, you guttersnipe. Rico! Quick, kill him. Hello Miss Walker, yes this is Inspector Collie. I'm sorry to trouble you but I wonder if you have any idea where we can find Jim Bankley? No, why do you ask, has something happened? Yes, McLeod has been found killed. We have a good idea that Bankley might be able to help us. Did he have anything to do with it? Yes, I'm afraid he did. Do you think I could come around and have a word with you later on? I'll be here. Why didn't you tell him? Because I believe what you told me. But you must give yourself up, you haven't killed anyone. I wouldn't stand a chance. All Francesi has to do is get a few of his little friends to swear they saw me kill McLeod and I'm finished. Where will you go? I'll try and get back to Canada I guess. Nothing else I can do. What'll you do there? Oh, I can get a job. A legitimate job. I've had my fill of this easy money. Do you need any money? No, I'll be all right. Betty, you have no reason to help me. The best thing I can do is get outta your way. I can only bring you trouble. Will I see you again? I doubt it. But I'd like to call you when I get clear. Francesi knows you're the only one I know in England. He's bound to come here looking for me. I'd like to know that you're all right. Don't worry about me, you look after yourself. That's been my trouble all along, thinking of myself too much. Well, goodbye Betty. You, Betty have you seen this? He's a murderer. Listen father, Jim didn't kill anyone. The Francesi gang are after him now. They killed Bill, they killed McLeod. Yes and he's one of them, he's an accomplice. And so am I, just told Collie he wasn't here. What? Do you realize what this means when Collie finds out? You'll be arrested, charged with hiding a murderer. - I don't care. - Don't worry, Mr. Walker. Collie will never find that out from me. - Jim... - No, let him go Betty. Bella, pack everything you need quickly, we're leaving tonight. Why? What's the matter? I'll tell you later. Hello... I want 753-371, this is 930-552. There's a warrant out for Bankley, somebody recognized him last night. It's only a question of time and we'll be next. This is just the chance Collie has been waiting for. Don't panic, if we get to Bankley before the police do, call the boys. No there's no time for that. We've gotta get out of here, the sooner the better. - Hello? - Hello, Augustino. This is Mr. Francesi speaking, now listen carefully. We are crossing tonight. Take her under the cove and as close in-shore as you can and have a boat ready to pick us up when I signal. Echo, all right. Bella, you've got four hours to get ready. I'll pick you up at two o'clock. - I'm not going. - Come again? I'm not going until I've settled with Jim. Go on, call Sam and Mick. Betty, it's fixed. I can get out okay, I'll leave tonight. Call me back, father's still here. In about five minutes, he's just going. - Who was that, Collie? - No, no one you know. I'm going to the gym, call me if anything happens. That'll be Collie. Promise you won't say anything about Jim. You've seen to that, show him in. Who are you, what do you want? What the hell are you doing here, get out. I'm sorry Walker, we are looking for someone. - Where is he? - Get out of here, all of you. - Stay out of it. - Stop that. - Where is he? - Who? I don't know what you mean. Jim Bankley. I don't know, I haven't seen him. - I'll look around. - You haven't seen him? Leave her alone. Sit down. Cut that out, Buddy. Bella, can't you see she doesn't know anything anyway? We are wasting too much time. She knows all right. Careful Bella, it may be Collie. Or Jim. - Betty? - Hello Jim. Just talking things over, why don't you join us? Your girlfriend wants you. Invite him over, Betty. No, don't Well I didn't know you felt that way about it. That makes things a lot easier, now listen to me. She won't get hurt if you do exactly what I tell you to. Don't try to be clever. If you bring any policemen, we'll kill the girl. I want you over here alone in 20 minutes. All right. Alone huh? Yeah. Okay Bella, I'll be there. Police, give me Scotland Yard will you? Hello, can I speak to an Inspector Collie please? Bankley, Jim Bankley. Look he knows me, just tell him Jim Bankley's on the phone, will you? - It's Bankley. - Bankley, give it. Hello, Collie here. Collie. It's him all right, trace his call. Look Bankley, where are you? Nevermind about that. Look Collie, Francesi and his sister are over at Betty Walker's place. They've got her and the old man and if I don't get over there in 20 minutes, they're gonna kill her. No, that won't work, it's me they want. They said they'd kill her at the first sign of any cop. Look, I noticed you got a lot of your little helpers hanging around but I gotta get through there alone. Yeah, they mean it. Look Collie, are you gonna let me through? Look, it's the only way. All right, Bankley. Yes we'll let you through but we'll pick you up afterwards. Okay. Bankley's just come out of number 10 gate, heading west. How long to go, Buddy? We're wasting our time Rico, he ain't gonna show up. Nobody in their right mind would show up. The only guests we could hope for are the cops. Five more minutes and then we go, Bella. He's here. Buddy, let him in. Hello, we meet again. Why didn't you keep running when you had a chance? Show him in, Buddy. Come on, sucker. Jim you shouldn't have come, I tried to warn you. Thanks, Betty. You've given my brother and me a lot of trouble. You shouldn't have run out on us like that. All right I'm here now, let's go. Leave these people out of it. You can put a bullet through me, I guess I deserve it for getting mixed up with you in the first place. But let's get outta here and leave the Walker's out of it. You're not going anyplace. Not now Bella, not yet. There's two carloads full of cops, one on each end of the street. Okay big brain, what are you gonna do now? Get me the police. - Hey, what's she doing? - Quiet. Let me speak to Inspector Collie, please. Collie, this is Bella Francesi. You've been very busy this morning, haven't you? No, I have a better idea. We're gonna take a little ride in my car and we're taking the Walker girl with us. Look, you'll only make it worse for yourself. Come out into the street now and leave Bankley and the Walkers behind. Maybe you better talk to her father, huh? Come here, talk to Collie. Hello Collie, for God's sake let them through. I have already lost Bill to these murderers. Look Mr. Walker, you're asking me to let your son's murderer escape. Yes yes, I know how you feel but what on earth would happen if- Hello, hello? He's rung off. They're threatening the girl unless we let them through. What do we do, sir? - Is my car outside? - Yes sir. Come on. They're leaving the house now sir, Bankley and the girl. O'Brien's asking for instructions. - Buddy, drive off. - Well what about Mick? Nevermind about Mick, he can take care of himself. Drive on. Do as I say, drive off. They're moving off sir. O'Brien says they're drawing level, what instructions? We'll have to let 'em go. What's he doing, is he moving? - Not yet. - Step on it, Buddy. This is where we see if it works. Keep going, we'll find out soon enough. - He let us through. - I knew they would. Buddy, take the main road to the South Coast. Okay. Alpha Roberts has sighted car on Highway 24. Map preference seven four two 0, heading south. Good, good. Tell him to take the parallel road, reference A seven four two five. Which way do we go? Just keep going, we'll turn later on, I'll tell you. Okay. Don't you know where you're going, Buddy? You, be quiet. Don't you know where the Francesi's are taking you? Keep him quiet. Buddy's an old friend of mine, Bella. I just don't want to see him make any mistakes. - Shut up. - Oh, leave him alone. Let him talk, he can't do us any harm now. That's right Buddy, you're not scared of them, they're on the run. I was on the run myself, all fixed to get out. All fixed to get out of the country. I even had a boat waiting. You got a boat waiting, Buddy? I told you to keep him quiet. Why don't you leave him alone and we can take care of him later? Thanks Buddy. When you're heading for the Coast, shouldn't you know where you're going? Maybe they're just taking you for a ride too. They dropped Mick, didn't they? Left him to the cops, you're next in line. You got a boat waiting, Rico? Just concentrate on your driving. Sure he's got a boat waiting with room for two. Hey Buddy, take a look at Bella. Look at all that ice she's wearing. She's got it all with her, believe me. They've got their bags packed, they're in the back of this car. You got a bag back there with a sailor's suit in it, Buddy? They've made all their arrangement, you made yours? I told you I felt sorry for you but I didn't know you were that big a sucker. Why don't you stop the car Buddy and have a look and see if they are packed to leave? Come on, what do you got to lose? That's enough of that. Buddy, turn into the woods at the next path. Can't you see it, Buddy? Now Rico, and take her with you. Out. Bella, Rico, take Betty with you. She won't bring you any trouble. That's enough, now go on, walk here. Go on. Hold it, Rico. Run, Betty. You've killed him, Bella. It's your fault, it's all your fault. I'm sorry, Betty. I got you into all this. I told you I'd only bring you trouble. Is he all right? Radio for an ambulance. You've already spent a month in custody while in hospital recovering from your wounds and have apparently suffered considerably and in the light of evidence given by Detective Inspector Collie, I'm satisfied that you don't intend to continue your association with criminals. I therefore propose to deal leniently with you. You are sentenced to one month's imprisonment starting from the time of your arrest. You are therefore discharged and I bind you over for a period of two years to keep the peace, Mr. Walker having agreed to go surety for you. Do you understand? Yes sir. Thank you. Next case.
