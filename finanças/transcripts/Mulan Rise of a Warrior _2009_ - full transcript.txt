We can have wine if we win! Come! General Hua! You are a great guy! I want to be your sworn brother! Sorry, General Hua! He's drunk General Hua, I'm not drunk! General Hua! Let's tell her the truth No! Now the army's morale is strong and it all hinges on her! I always hoped... her heart would harden And not be bothered by matters of emotion As long as the Rourans still live, we do not have a home The nation's business is more important than our own You two are so lonely! Chiefs Futu, Shelun and Buluzhen are outside, waiting to bid farewell to Your Highness Your Highness! My tribe lost badly in the Battle of Buhe, We wish to return to the grassland to rest and recover! I gathered everyone this time, not just to loot and plunder! With the Donghu, Dayue and Dawan tribes together we can attack and claim the Central Plains Forever leave the frigid north, and realize the dreams of the Rouran! Now I need everyone to be united. What do you think? The Old Danyu is kind, and has permitted us to depart Yes, Your Highness! Come! Bring the wine! My father is kind. And you have worked very hard! Futu, you have worked hardest I will see you off first Thank you, Your Highness! Who will be next? Father Futu was talking the other tribes into retreating, so I killed him Child! I know you are unhappy, having run around the grasslands for so long, trying to gather all the tribes Father, my life was given to me by you. I will not speak of unhappiness. Morale is too low now, they cannot take another battle We must preserve the Rouran bloodlines When you are Danyu you will understand But I am not content! With our strength, we might not lose That means we also might not win Let us retreat Father, do you remember what you used to say when I was a boy and would ask you why we always loot and plunder? We Rourans don't have iron Why do we need iron? To make weapons Why do we need weapons? So we can loot and plunder! Yes, Father. I think like my sister. I also dream of a day when we can finally stop looting year after year and live the abundant life of the Wei people As long as we take the Wei territory, I will fulfill my responsibility Father, you should agree with me, right? Danyu, it has been polished Gude, stay and serve me! My father's soul has risen to the sky From today on, I, Mendu, am your new Danyu - Danyu! - Danyu! - Danyu! - Danyu! Your mother's family name is Yuguo We must marry in the future, to birth the most purebred Rouran child who shall rule the earth! Mendu of the Rouran has become the new Danyu He has gathered an army of 200,000 and is ready to strike south What do you think, Generals? Commander-in-chief! I have fought with Mendu before He is cruel and violent We cannot go against his 200,000 troops with out meager forces Why don't we retreat, defend the gateways, and wait for them to come to us? What do you think? Commander-in-chief! If we retreat, morale will drop, and if Mendu pursues us at this time, we will suffer great losses I beg you to consider, we must not retreat! I beg for your command to lead the frontlines! General Hua, you are so loyal and courageous What is your strategy? Normally, we confront with the main and win by surprise Normally, we would confront the enemy with the main troop While a secondary troop hides in ambush But this time I want to do the opposite! I lead the confrontation troop. While Commander-in-chief leads the main as a surprise As long as I have a small victory at the start and anger Mendu Thus luring him to chase us with all his might I will pretend to be trapped in a canyon Mendu will think they can butcher us so they will be reckless Commander-in-chief will be in ambush behind them And as soon as the enemy turns around please release smoke, I will turn and lead my troops into the fray so they will be attacked from front and rear! Good! I will give you a troop of 20,000 Commander-in-chief Speed is of the essence, I wish to depart tonight Please place our supplies... at the canyon for our use We will go according to this plan Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! I am General Hua Mulan of the Great Wei Nation Has your Commander-in-chief became a shrinking turtle and sent a peon like you to your death? This is the territory of the Great Wei Nation. Please leave! But I like your territory! Remember, Wei people are sheep we Rouran are wolves! Steady! We have Han, Shi, Xianbei and Jiang men, but no sheep! They have 20,000 men. I'll give you 40,000 men and 4 hours. Destroy them! Yes, sir! Hail! Hail! Standing archers! Shoot! Kill! Lift! Stop!

Sit down General, the medic and all the medications disappeared during the Poison Dragon! Stop! Danyu! Why are we not pursue while we are victorious? Destroy Hua Mulan first, then go after Zang Zhi! Where can he go from here? They're trapped! Danyu, you mean... Killing can be done in an instant I like to watch people in desperation, especially Hua Mulan! General Hua, We have made a thorough search but have found no supplies or water in the canyon Gather and redistribute the available supplies Kill the horses Kill the horses! Keep their blood for future use! Yes, sir! Commander-in-chief's smoke will be our last hope If I die before it comes lead our brothers in defense for me I've watched you over all these years You've done a great job! I dreamed that I've died you all left me there was no one around me I count the stars every night There is not an extra one so you won't die! You're so good to me! General! Cry! Cry to your brothers for help! Get them to help you! Cry! Cry for your General to save you! Cry! General, I beg you to save them! I won't allow you to be sacrificed But General! That's Tiger! Your brother! You are all my brothers! We must wait! Hu Guei, don't fall for their trap! Tiger! Turtle! Tiger! Turtle! A century of human life is like a dream Life and death occur, heroes have no regrets Protect my homeland, show off my nation's pride What joy is there in life, what regrets in death There are enemy winds up north, but home fires down south I miss my wife and children, and my home They are across the mountains, far away... Ashina! Yes, Danyu! A century of human life... If they don't come out, kill them! ...is like a dream Life and death occur, heroes have no regrets Protect my homeland, show off my nation's pride What joy is there in life, what regrets in death Tiger! There are enemy winds up north, but home fires down south I miss my wife and children... ...and my home They are across the mountains, far away... Finally, peace and quiet! We are out of supplies and can no longer hold our position Commander-in-chief is really not coming If we do not get medication you and the brothers won't be able to hang on Even if I die I must die in battle! Will you come with me? Willl Wentai! You are the one person... I will never forget! Heroes, our troops are stationed here originally to meet up with Commander-in-chief and his troops! But... he betrayed us! Today, we will stain the battlefield with our blood Behind us is our homeland If we have to bleed out our last drop of blood, if we have to become bleached bones in this desert, we must defend it to the death! We must let the Rourans know we Wei warriors will never surrender and will never compromise! Soldiers may rebel against me generals may leave me for dead but I, Hua Mulan, will never betray my country! Brothers! After this meal we will kill their Danyu and chop down their flag! Are you afraid to die? No! Are you afraid to die? Kill! Kill! Kill! Black Wind, in our next life, we'll reverse roles and you kill me General, you can't kill Black Wind! Kill me instead! You must not kill Black Wind! General! Black Wing must not be killed, General! General! General! General! General! General! You should rest Get your Danyu to come here and talk!

Leave the medics ands supplies! Let's go! Yes, sir! Danyu orders a retreat! I didn't imagine you would recover so quickly I still have many important things to do General When our brothers have recovered, lead them back home General, where are you going? You must not follow me General! General This is a military command! General! Take care, everyone General General Danyu! What are you doing? Pick it up! Yes, sir How much gold... do you think your father will pay for you? He doesn't like me, so you may be disappointed Even wolves protect their cubs: Never mind humans I've never, and don't plan to, befriend a wolf You are right In your eyes I am a wolf But for us Rourans I am a once-in-a millennium heroic king He who wins his people's hearts wins his nation You think you can take the world with a knife? You may be a victorious conqueror, but if you cannot let your people live a good life even if you are lucky enough to win there will be thousands like me who will fight against you Causing piles of white bones just to satisfy your personal ambition! Are you talking like a drunk, because you cannot hold your alcohol? Thank you! I know what you are thinking Don't worry When I take the Wei territory and become king, I will fulfill your dream of becoming queen I wanted to be a queen of Wei so that generations of Rourans... won't have to suffer the ravages of war It is different from your reason! No matter how much land you take, I will never agree with what you have done Who are you? Don't worry, Princess. I am Wei General Hua Mulan I know of you Are you trying to use me to rescue your Prince? I respect your dream of making peace, between our countries I wish to help you fulfill your dream Fulfill my dream? You overestimate me. I am merely a woman My brother killed our father for the throne, and I dare not speak up! Actually, I am... also a woman Amazing! I enlisted in my father's place, just to fulfill my filial duty I never imagined I would achieve any accomplishments, not to mention that one day... I would become a butcher on the battlefield In these twelve years, my heart has never felt at ease Princess, only when we resolve the cause of this war can we stop the war itself Your own fate as well as that of the whole world... is in your hands Your messengers have come and agreed to all of my terms Your father loves you very much Thank you for telling me this Let everyone know, we'll celebrate for three days! Thank you, Danyu! I've thought it through. You are right. Husband, please have a drink Great! Come! You dare to kill me? I must avenge the Old Danyu! Mulan Rise! Thank you, Your Majesty Hua Mulan is here! Commander-in-chief is a coward. I have dealt with him. I bow before Your Majesty It's General Hua! Salute! We respectfully bring General back to your hometown! Master Where is Father? He waited here for you every day Father I am home! I hereby name Hua Mulan the Commander-in-chief of the Wei nation! I do not wish to become an official I have been at war for twelve years and been unable to take care of my father who has been ill. Please allow me to go home. I am a woman. Please punish me. It is our nation's great fortune to have a woman like you I have long since forgiven you. Thank you, Your Majesty I have an announcement for the whole nation: The marriage between my son Hong and the Rouran Princess! Our two nations will now be friends. The fighting will stop forever and from now on, there will be peace! Adjourned! Thank you, Your Majesty! Hong, your marriage to the Rouran Princess is a national event! Do you understand your responsibility? I do, Sire It's so nice to have a daughter Always filial, understanding and obedient And now, she's a pretty General! Coming! Let's go away together! Doesn't matter where! You once said if you could give your life... to end this war you would do it It's easy for me to give up my life but it's too difficult to give up the woman I love In order that there be no more Tigers That no more families end up with just a bloody dog tag... I understand Forget about me! For twelve years, every day I wake up in the battlefield my first thought is of you Knowing you are there, gives me the courage to open my eyes Forever after, it will still be the same every day Someone once said, go too far from home and you will lose your roots kill too many people and you will forget yourself If you die in battle your life will sink into the ground like rain and vanish without a trace If at that time, you fall in love with someone hope will blossom again from the earth and embrace life with passion! Thank you, Wentai!
