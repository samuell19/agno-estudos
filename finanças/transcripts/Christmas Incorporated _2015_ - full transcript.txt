RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM So as you can see on my resume, I got an internship right out of school... Wait... You aren't currently employed? No. No, my entire division was downsized a few months ago. We're only interested in hiring candidates who are currently employed. Why would I be looking for a job if I already had a job? Well if you have a job and are looking for a job, then you are looking for the right job, not just a job. We only hire first string top performers. First string top performers are never unemployed. So you're telling me despite my qualifications and experience, you won't employ me because I'm unemployed? Exactly. Miss Vance? Riley, it's a pleasure to meet you. Come this way. So as you can see I was awarded an internship right out of school and I turned that opportunity into a full time position as Executive Assistant to the VP Of Visual Merchandising and Brand Development... We have dozens of applicants with an Ivy League education. I'm sure you understand. I understand completely, but I have plenty of experience. Yes, but I need someone with the right experience. Quitters never win, winners never quit. Yeah William Young, Young Incorporated. He burns through assistants. They're holding open interviews today, they need someone ASAP! Thanks for the hot tip! Did you get that big job? Not yet, but I just got a hot tip on a job working for William Young. Who's William Young? Young Incorporated? You've never heard of him? Your father probably has. Alvin pick up the phone, it's Riley! What's the news from the big city? Young Incorporated, go... Great company. Build, buy, and sell American. In all the financial papers for the last few months. William Young is the son of the late Thomas Young and recently inherited control of his fathers' corporate empire. Well I'm on my way to interview to be William Young's assistant right now. That's a fantastic opportunity. I mean, it's a company in transition and where there's problems, there's profits. Your father and I are rooting for you! Get out there and show them what the Vances are made of. Thanks for the pep talk, guys. I miss you both. I'll be home for Christmas before you know it. Okay. Hi... I'll just put that there. Alright. Hi! Hello, I'm Riley Vance, I'm here to interview for the assistant position. Well I can't guarantee you'll be seen before we fill the position but you're welcome to wait. Thank you. I'll take my chances. I wish this Christmas will be extra special. Katharine H! Two minutes and forty five seconds. Spencer T! Georgina K. Almost five minutes. No. Riley V! Riley V. Riley V going once! Riley V going twice! I'm here, I'm here! I'm sorry about that, I was distracted by the speed interviews. People were coming in and out of here so fast you'd think your office had a revolving door. Have a seat. My name is Amanda Sage, I'm Senior Advisor to Mr. Young. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Sage. You have an impressive resume. I do? I mean, I'm glad you think so. Tell me, why did you fix the star topper on our Christmas tree? You saw that? I didn't think anybody noticed. I noticed. Well the Star Topper is the focal point of the tree, and if the focal point is off, then Christmas chaos is sure to ensue. I'm just kidding, but, I, I do love Christmas, and I think it's a magical time, when anything is possible, decorating is a must, because it's part of the magic, attention to detail, striving for perfection and making sure things are done right, those are things that I aspire to every day. Tell me what you see. Well there is a discrepancy between the details page and the summary page, and all of your holdings but one are in the black. I would have thought that financial analysis was outside of your skill set. Well I have a lot of what I call "off the job experience." My father has been, an entrepreneur my whole life, he's taught me most of what I know about the business world. No family business to take over? No... No, I'm hoping to make my own mark on the world. You remind me of my younger self, a young girl about the same age as you are who was once seated across the desk from the founder of this company hoping for an opportunity just like you are. William needs somebody like that not just by his side but on his side and my instincts are telling me you're that person. If William agrees, the job is yours. Let's go get a few minutes with him right now. Riley Vanarden? Ms. Sage, there's something I need to tell you... Tell them they'll have to wait until after the New Year. Make sure this goes out overnight. While under the guidance of Thomas Young, the Young Brand stood for unrivaled quality, excellence, and the indefatigable American can do spirit. The Junior Mr. Young, gross, has a pair of big shoes to fill taking over for his late father. Will he chart his own course, one that stretches beyond the shadow cast by his father's financial empire, or will the company suffer from his inexperience? The only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about. I want to... Have the freedom to be my own man and escape the media's portrayal as "Junior Mr. Young." You surrendered that right at birth, my friend. Can we just talk about the factory. Can we delay the shutdown until the new year? No, closing the factory now is the right decision. It protects our bottom line and just gets it off our books during fiscal quarter. Shutting down the flagship of Young Inc registers not only as a failure but a symbolic failure under my watch, and people, I need a win in my debut. It is a win, it's a win for the shareholders, it's a win for breaking away from traditions. It's a symbolic gesture under your new leadership. Mr. Young? Dover is a town known for its good, hard working people, Have you been to the factory to evaluate it first hand? I haven't been there since I was a young kid. Then, with all due respect, how do you know for certain that it can't be saved? Who are you? Who is she? This is Riley, your new assistant. Isn't that my decision? Exactly, that's why I wanted her to meet you. You're on. Okay, Riley. Say you're me, what's my first move? I would visit the factory. Talk to the work force. Spend time on the factory floor. Let your critics know that you're willing to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work to compensate for whatever perceived inexperience you may have. Closing the factory demonstrates that you're capable of making the tough decisions to run this company. Tough decisions absolutely, but it may not be the right decision. You're not gonna take advice from someone who just walked off the street, are you? No, no of course not. That's why we should get her off the street before somebody else does. You're hired. Amanda, send Riley to Dover immediately and have her set up for my trip. Can you pack your bags and be on Huntley Airstrip in two hours? Yes, I will be there ready to travel. Welcome to the family business, Riley. Thank you. Let's go. You were very impressive in there. Thanks Ms. Sage. I consider us lucky to have you. I'll drop by HR and make things official. Was there something you needed to tell me earlier? It can wait. Have a good trip. Hi, Mom. Merry Christmas! The good news is I got the job. That's fantastic, congratulations. I knew you could do it. She got the job. Couldn't be more proud of you, good job honey! But the bad news is, They think I'm somebody else. I don't understand. They think you're someone else, How could you be anybody other than who you are? Well when they called me in they called "Riley V." Of course I am Riley V but there must have been another Riley V there who stepped out or got tired of waiting because... Well they interviewed me off of her resume, hired me on the spot, but I think they think I'm her. But you're not her, you're you. I know I'm me. Did you explain that to them? I was afraid they would fire me. You need to go in there right now and tell them the truth. They'll look foolish for hiring the wrong person. Well then convince them they hired the right person! Well that's what I'm planning to do, I'm already on the job, they're sending me to Dover, New Hampshire. The town needs the toy factory to stay open in order to survive, and, well, I think I can help, but I can't help if I'm not there. Riley... Mom, I need you to trust me on this, there's much more at stake than my job, I need to see this through and I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but if I am, at least I'm doing it for the right reasons. Hi! Hi there. I'm Riley Vance, I'm Mr. Young's assistant. I'm Piper. It's a pleasure to meet you. Is Mr. Young with you? You're a few days too early. Mr. Young prefers to drive. Shoot. Really? Mayor Keegan hired me to drive him into town. We heard he was arriving today, and wanted to extend the proper welcome. Aw, well you can drive me into town if you want, I'd love to get a feel for the place before I settle in. Why not? Let me get your bags. Thank you. Everyone owes their living, in some way, to Mr. Young and the toy factory. People here are trying to enjoy the Christmas season but everyone's a little bit nervous. If the factory closes and people lose their jobs, well there won't be much cause for celebration. I know all too well what that feels like. My dad lost his job when I was young. But he bounced back. He started his own company. It's like stepping into a Norman Rockwell painting. Small town living at its finest. Everyone knows everyone else's name, and if you come across someone you don't know, the general rule is to just say "Hi" and introduce yourself. They're just setting up for the Winter Carnival now. In my hometown we have a Winter Parade, Santa Claus, his reindeers, carolers, the works. Well we have a Christmas Carolvan. What is a Christmas Carolvan? It's hard to describe to someone without it sounding cheesy, but I promise, you can't help but feel the Christmas spirit once you see it with your own eyes. I can't wait. Thank you. I have more than one job. A real go-getter. Do you think that there's any chance your boss will keep the factory open? Honestly I don't know. I've been his assistant for less than a day, but this is the season of miracles. And based on my first glance of the town, I don't see how he couldn't be overwhelmed with Christmas Spirit once he spends time here. I'm gonna ride instead of fly, a nice long road trip will give me time to wrap my head around what needs to be done. I'll tell Riley. This trip will be good for you. Give you a chance to prove that you're not just Thomas Young's son, you're Mr. Young now. I'm not terribly thrilled about visiting this close to Christmas, and risk of being exposed to an insufferable amount of Christmas cheer. Hundreds of jobs are depending on your decision, not to mention the livelihood of their families, the town. Do yourself a favor, and them, Don't come off like a Scrooge. Blah Humbug! Drive safe. Thank you. Hello... Excuse me... I'm sorry, I'm Martin Keegan, the Town Mayor. Hi, Mr. Mayor, I'm Riley Vance. Well, a pleasure to meet you, Miss Vance. Piper told me you're Mr. Young's assistant, right? Yes! Okay, here is my private cell number, if you call I will personally answer it, at any time of day or night. If I can be of any assistance to you or Mr. Young in any way while you're in town, please don't hesitate to let me know. Where is Mr. Young staying? I've booked him into a suite at the hotel. We can do much better than that. Let me pull some strings. I know some people who would be more than willing to rent out their place, nicest house in town, fit for someone of Mr. Young's stature. I want to do everything I can to make Dover feel just like home for him, you know, while he's here. Thank you! Okay. Pleasure! Okay! Watch your step here. Thanks. No, no, no, no you're going to love the hotel. The staff are going to wait on you hand and foot. Here we go, that's it, that's good. I thought you said they were willing to rent out their house. Willing to take one for the team, or in this case, the town. Everyone okay in there? Good. Can I lend you a hand with that? I think I've got it but thanks for the offer. I'm Rebecca Neston with the Dover Citizen. I'd love to speak to Mr. Young, get his personal opinion on closing the factory. But, he's not closing... Okay, do you have a, card? Well I will talk to Mr. Young about getting you some face time with him. Thank you. What did she want? An interview with my boss. I would steer clear of her. She's a barracuda, more about making news than reporting it. Thanks for the warning. A little Christmas cheer should do the trick. William Young. Mr. Young, it's Riley. I wanted to get your E.T.A. GPS says I'm two hours out. Great. I think you are going to love the house I rented for you. And I'll be here when you arrive to help you get settled in. Great, thank you. Okay he is due any minute. We're ready for him. You don't think that this is just a little bit much? There is nothing I wouldn't do to help this town, hmm? Okay people, now, When Mr. Young arrives, I want you to make him feel as much at home as possible, as if he'd lived here all his life, a welcoming he will never forget. Are you with me? Afternoon. Officer. I pulled you over to give you a warning. Noticed your New York tags. You're driving a little fast. See, we like everyone to be safe when they come through our town. Yes, I completely understand, sir. Good. Just need to see your license and registration for the record. Of course. You know, unfortunately it appears I have misplaced my identification. I'm sorry to hear that. Gonna to have to take you in until you can prove your identity. Excuse me? Yeah, it's the law. I'm sure it is. Listen officer... Sheriff. Sheriff, of course. I'm William Young, The Young Toy Factory. I'm sure you've seen my photo. So you want to do this the easy way, or the hard way? Okay. Yeah, there we go. Just this way. He's not answering. It's like he vanished. We'll give him a few more minutes. Okay people, come on, let's liven up here, huh? We only got one chance to make a good first impression on him. Mayor Keegan. What!? Okay, right. I found Mr. Young. We're need to take a ride. Piper start the car. Everyone you stay put, and we'll be right back, okay? Where are we going? I'll tell you in the car. Just tell me now. He's in jail. Jail!? What? All right, Mr. Young, you are free to go. Enjoy your stay in the town. It's a beautiful place to be during the Christmas Season. Well, thanks for the hospitality fellas. We need to talk. Merry Christmas to you. Thank you very much. This is our ride. Mr. Young, I'm terribly sorry about what happened... Get us outta here. Mr. Young, this is Piper, I hired her to drive us around while we're in town. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Young. New York City, step on it. Seriously? Mr. Young is just being funny. At least I think he is, aren't you? What's with all this? I thought the house could use some Christmas Spirit, make it feel more like home. You don't like it? Like it, no I hate it. What do you have against Christmas? Look, I've fired people for less than this, do you want to get fired? Do you want to fire me? I mean I could understand for doing something wrong but not for doing something nice. Not to mention I just bailed you out of jail. You didn't bail me out of jail, I didn't need to be bailed out I just needed to prove my identity. Okay wait, am I seriously fired? Because if I am, I'm leaving all of these decorations up for you to deal with. No, no, I'm not firing you, look, I'm just exhausted and there's still a lot of work to do, okay? I don't celebrate Christmas. Can you please take them down? Fine. Thank you. Bedroom? Well this isn't gonna be good for business, this isn't going to be good for anybody. Hi... I'm sorry, one second. Good morning, Amanda. You're in town for less than 24 hours and you make the front page of the local paper? I thought all publicity was good publicity. Try telling that to the shareholders. Look, it's the local paper, it's no big deal. If it stayed local, it wouldn't be a big deal. The story was picked up by all the NYC tabloids. Honestly, William, the entire point of the trip was to promote a solid image of leadership. It was a minor incident. Look, I know you didn't do anything wrong other than misplace your license. People are going to see that headline and assume you did. Good bye. Cream? What's that? Cream, for your coffee? Yes, thank you. Just doing my job. So you saw the headline? I did. And how do you think I should respond? By doing the job you came here to do. Right. Okay, well then, let's get to work. You look just like your father William. I met him during the very first day that I worked here. He went out of his way to talk to me when he found out that I was the newest employee. And he gave me a piece of advice that I have never forgotten. He said, "Never present problems without solutions." Now that is great advice, from a great man. Universally considered a great man, unless he was your father. Well this is our factory, we're one big happy family. We want to feel like you're part of that family as long as you're with us and I'm hoping that you and I are gonna be able to work out a solution to keep this whole family together. So I'd like to walk you through the production line, from the start to the finish. That way you get a sense of how a toy is made and let's you meet some of our workers. Alright, why don't we start over here? Obviously, our painting station. Our problem is simple, our costs are up, our sales are down. We just lost a major contract with a brick and mortar chain six months ago. Has there been any progress with other sales channels? Well we've been trying to break in to the online space, but so far, none of the majors are willing to negotiate a rate of commission for us that makes any kind of sense with our price point. Okay. And they're saying that our toys are "too traditional." What about effort towards new products? Well, so far we don't have anything beyond the concept phase. We just don't have the resources to put into the research and development for a new product line. Well what we need to do is take what may appear to be a weakness about our product, and market it as a strength. Any suggestions you have, we are more than happy to take them. I had one of these when I was a kid. Sorry. I'm just, I'm feeling nostalgic, My dad got me one of these for Christmas one year and I loved it so much until the batteries died. I love you. Unfortunately, every toy has it's time... Excuse me I'm gonna have to take this. Did you ever get one of these? It was the gift on Christmas morning that year. What's your name? Cute. Wait, don't move. Get that eyelash. Make a wish. I'm hungry! I've got it! I present to you the Christmas Wishing Bear... That's Jeffrey the bear. Not anymore. It is now a Christmas Wishing Bear! Everybody needs a miracle in their life, a little bit of Christmas magic. So we enable people to give each other a Christmas Wish. We'll re-program the voice chips, so he's not complaining about being hungry or tired anymore, instead he'll offer hope, a wish! A Christmas wish. So does he grant multiple wishes or just one wish? That is open for discussion. I think the solution creates more problems than it solves. I mean how do we get this all done and distributed in the time we have? How does a $10 item turn the entire factory around? And how do we get kids to be interested in this when it's so close to Christmas? But it isn't just for kids. I think adults would love it too. And that gives us a bigger market. Well it's obsolete merchandise, already written down so anything that we make would be pure cash flow. If we were able to sell the entire inventory, let's just say that would do wonders for our bottom line. I could have a merchant website up by the end of the day. And we could reach out and get the entire town involved, you know have them send out emails, tweets, get the word out. We wouldn't have to spend anything on advertising except for our time. Maybe we could look at re-branding some of our other products. What do you say, Mr. Young? Do we have your blessing? I still think it seems like an impossible task. Nothing is impossible at Christmas time. All right. Prove me wrong. Joe! I love it. I'm going to buy fifty of these and give them as gifts to all my constituents. Well that is a great start but I need you to get the entire town on it. Spread the word, email, tweet, shout it from the rooftops, send carrier pigeons, just do everything you can. Think of it as our own grass roots Kickstarter campaign. Consider it done. I'm gonna reach out to my dad, as well. He's got relationships with buyers and sellers all over the world through his online store. So who knows, maybe we'll be able to sell off all the old... ...vintage inventory. With any luck, we'll pull off a Christmas Miracle. I certainly hope so! Give me a few of these. There you go, okay. Thank you! Piper, I have another job for you. I need to get these to anyone willing to spread the word. And please tell them to forward the link to everybody they know. Don't worry. I'll get the word out. Like Santa around the globe on Christmas Eve. Well, thank you! Hi! Unfortunately nothing here has changed at all. All the books are still completely upside down. I wish I could do something, I really do but honestly, they would need a miracle. I guess it's just a matter of timing. I can go through the motions, keep up appearances here, protect the company image. Okay. Yeah, bye bye. Is this seat taken? Oh my, you look like you got the weight of the world on your shoulders. Not the world, just the town. I'm trying to come up with a way to save the toy factory. I find the most complex problems are often solved with the simplest solutions. That's a nice sentiment Santa, but this is no easy task. I said simple, I didn't say easy. You've got your work cut out for you but you're not alone, you've got a whole town behind you they're all hoping and wishing for the same miracle. Believe me, that's a powerful thing. More powerful than you might realize. That's real Christmas magic. If you can help William find his Christmas spirit, he'll genuinely do the right thing. Remember, this is Christmas time, it's a season of miracles. Sorry. Hi! Hi. So the Mayor was wondering if you would be willing to make an announcement to the town about our plan to save the factory. Help get the word out. I'm not quite sure I'm the best candidate for the job, I mean I'm an outsider to these people, right? You'll be great. Who better than Mr. Young himself to spread the word? Evening Mr. Young. Hello. It's good to see you again. Riley, I want to apologize again for what happened the other day. Our Sheriff is a little bit too by the book. We had every intention of giving you a proper welcome but, well, I never intended for it to turn into such a disaster. I'm sure your heart was in the right place, sir. It was. So we'd like to make up for it by making you our guest of honor at the Winter Carnival. Now if you'd be so kind as to follow me, Mr. Young the entire town is so looking forward to meeting you. It would mean the world to us. Mr. Young, come on. Hello everyone! I would rather be facing a firing squad than this much Christmas cheer. Welcome to the one hundred and fourteenth Winter Carnival celebration! Are we feeling good tonight? Alright. Now I'd like to say a few words before we get started. Our town owes a great deal to the Young family. Their factory has kept this town thriving for over fifty years. Here representing them and our guest of honor tonight, William Young himself. Good evening everyone. Are you going to keep the factory open? Yeah! Good question, we have a plan in place, but we will need all of your help to make it happen. How is that going to keep the factory open? A Christmas Wish, a Christmas Wish to Save a Town. It's a fantastic plan. Now if each and every one of you spread the word to five people that you know outside of town, and they in turn spread the word to another five people, well word will spread like wildfire, right? Are we gonna do it? Are we gonna do it? I'm sorry. I thought this would go over better. Well it's not your fault. I feel like it is. Is there anything I can do? No. Just enjoy the carnival. Hello William. Hello Santa, hi. Wait, how do you know my name? There isn't a person in town who doesn't recognize William Young when they see him. Tell that to the Sheriff. Yeah, well maybe one. No offense Santa, but this doesn't exactly seem like a good location to be collecting donations, there's no one around. You're not exactly no one. Out of everyone in the entire town, at the moment, you have the most to give. I'm embarrassed to say that I don't have any cash on me, everything is plastic these days. How terribly true. You can give when you're ready. Okay. Good night Santa. Good night. Morning! I lost track of you last night at the Winter Carnival. How'd you end up? Can an overindulgence in Christmas cheer give you a hangover? In my experience, it should be quite the opposite. Why do you treat Christmas like it's your own personal kryptonite? You know, I think this town is my own personal Kryptonite. If you're committed to keeping the factory up and running like you say you are, you just need to prove that you're invested in the town. And what do you suggest? Since you asked, I have made a list of activities to get you out and about, connect with the town, show that you can fit in, be one of the regular folks. It will go a long way in helping us tailor the public image of you and the company. Comin' at ya! This wasn't on my list. That's exactly why I picked it. We need to get you doing things with visibility. Renting an entire skating rink for a night is more like in-visibilty. Baby steps, okay? Speaking of baby steps... Get out here, let's go. Okay. This is fine. Winter sports were a big part of my family growing up. I played hockey in both high school and college, could have gone pro. Why didn't you? Because I was groomed to take over the family business from the day I was born. There really wasn't another option as far as my dad was concerned. Do you ever regret it, not following your own path? I can't help but wonder "what if" every now and then, yeah. In one way or another, we're all trying to keep the "what if's" of our past from defining us. Hold on, is this your first time on skates? First time since I was five. So I think it's probably best if I just keep a safe distance, not risk losing any teeth. Nonsense. We came here to skate, and you will skate. Plus you're covered under the company dental plan, so it's fine. Thanks for the vote of no confidence. It's okay, come here, I'll have you skating on your own before you even realize it. Ballet lessons. That was my mother's weapon of choice to keep me busy after school. I much preferred hanging out with my dad, helping get his startup off the ground. He's an entrepreneur and he always said, you can do anything you want as long as you work hard enough at it. My dad though, something always seemed to go wrong right before he has the chance to grab the brass ring. Don't look now, but you're skating by yourself. Oh my god. I guess all those ballet lessons finally paid dividends, huh? Or you are just an incredible skating coach. Maybe. Okay, ready for a triple axle? Right. Don't go too fast! Let me see you fly, girl! How do I stop? You never do. You just go flying into the boards. I will have a triple vanilla espresso, dry, extra hot, and for the lady, a, Peppermint mocha, extra peppermint. Really? Am I wrong? No. He's smooth! Thanks, Piper. How did you do that? Just one of my talents, I guess. I don't know, I can read people. I may not have the business savvy that my dad had, but I can read just about anyone. Okay. How about Piper over there? Piper... She's hard working. We all know that. Okay. She's making up for a lack of self confidence. She's in a rut, but she's digging herself out with everything she's got. Maybe because of a break up with a guy. So every time a girl's in a rut it's because of a guy? No. Not you. Me what? You're not in a rut because of a guy. You're just too smart. Funny. I mean it. You know what I need to do before I ever do it. Amanda doesn't even know that and she's known me since I was a baby. So I'm just too smart and that's my problem? No, your problem is that you're not a CFO or a CEO or a VP. You don't have the luxury of being born into one of those positions. People like you usually get fired before you ever make it to middle management. And I was just starting to like you. I know, but if you let me finish, I was going to say that people like you are the ones that succeed. The breakouts. You can't make it in corporate America, so you carve out your own niche, breaking away from the norm and creating something special. Good save. You better mean that. I do mean it. I promise. You are something special, Riley. Here are your drinks. Told you she was a barracuda. Yes. Yes you did. So what's your story? I'm the big city girl who follows the small town boy to his small town and when he dumps her, she stays around. Big city? Chi-town. Chicago. Home of the White Sox, deep dish pizza and Al Capone! Anyways, I fell in love with this place at first sight and I just... Everyone was so welcoming, I couldn't bear to leave. Especially after my first Christmas here. And the boyfriend? He moved back to Chicago. Typical, right? We need to talk. Are you following me now? I have an offer for you, full access to Mr. Young for one no holds barred interview. In exchange for what? In exchange for you backing off of him with the snarky headlines. I need him to get some positive press. If you want to get him some positive press, I suggest you get him to do something positive. You're attacking the one man who can save this town. No, I'm not. I've seen his type before, they talk the talk but they don't walk the walk. You're wrong about William. He is a spoiled rich kid who has earned nothing. He was born into money. He's gonna to put his money where his mouth is. Oh really, can I quote you on that? No. No quote. So even you don't believe that. William doesn't care about this factory or this town. Like me, he knows this tired old town lost its luster a long time ago. Then why are you still here? Well I'm not gonna be for much longer. Your boss is the biggest thing that's ever happened here and he's my ticket to the big time. My first article on him blew up. And because of it, I have several other job prospects that are gonna get me out of here for good. So if you don't mind, have a nice day. Thank you ladies. Hi there! Hi! What are you doing here? I just wanted to make myself a little special meal. You cook? I am not without skills, okay? Alright, let's see. Chicken, Ritz Crackers, cream of mushroom soup, What exactly are you cooking? Little special family recipe. You're gonna mix all of that together? Yes. Is it edible? I'll have you know I intend to make you eat those words. Why don't you join me for dinner? Come on, there's enough for two. At least let me defend my family's honor in the kitchen. Sure, why not? Great. Trust me, it is going to be sinfully scrumptious. We'll see about that. A little dish called Chicken on the Ritz. Something my grandmother made for me as a boy. I get it now! Ritz Crackers, chicken on the Ritz. It's ritzy. "An elegant dish" she used to say. She taught me how to cook before I left for boarding school. You must have been a hit with the ladies, a girl loves a guy who knows how to cook. I may have been, if I didn't go to an all boys boarding school. But all my friends seemed to like it. They would come by every week for Sunday dinner, sometimes some of the teachers too. No way, so popular. I know, it was party time. There's a bottle of white wine in the fridge, would you grab it for us? Yeah. Alright. Okay, alright I had my doubts, but I have to admit, it tastes pretty good. I've been proven wrong. My hat is off to the chef. My grandmother's culinary honor remains in tact. I get the sense you two were pretty close. Yeah, yeah. She was the best person I've ever known. She was smart and caring and she was always delighted to see you. You sort of remind me of her. Just what every girl is dying to hear, that she reminds a guy of his grandmother. Okay, well... To clarify, I meant you remind me of her, More like her... Her character, not that you present a grandmother demeanor in any way shape or form whatsoever, so... Yeah, nice save. Yeah, thanks. So do you have any other hidden talents besides cooking I should know about? Well I guess you'll just have to wait and see. Are you the mystery woman? What? No. Of course not. I was just joking but you lost your cool way too fast, you are the mystery woman! It wasn't a date. He was just making himself dinner and invited me to eat with him. He made dinner for you? No man makes dinner for women without an ulterior motive. It is not like that. Well, like it or not, you went out on a first date with your boss. Okay, can you stop saying that because it's not a date unless you call it a date and it wasn't a date. You really like him. I've lost my mind. I mean you'd have to be crazy to be attracted to a successful good looking man. Hi! We're putting these out to everybody you know. Amanda Sage. Hey, Amanda, listen I'm gonna have to extend my trip by a couple days. I need some more time with the factory decision. You've had a change of heart? The heart is definitely involved. Let me push some things around on your schedule, I'll make it work. Bye. Run this down to Benjamin. I'd like to squeeze a hiring announcement into the company newsletter before distribution. Mr. Young! How would you like to participate in our Secret Santa? I don't know what that is. Well, every employee that wants to participate puts their name in the hat. You pick a name out of the hat, you buy that person a gift but it's a secret, so you become the Secret Santa for whoever's name you pick. It's voluntary. Yeah, yeah I'll do it. Sure. Great! Emily Lamb. Which one is she? Emily! Come over here! This is Mr. Young. Pleasure to meet you Emily. Nice to meet you too, sir. Emily is our youngest employee at 17. She comes here every day after school. I'm trying to save up for college. Fantastic. Hey! Hi Piper. I got your message telling me to meet you here. Is it about the headline, because to clarify despite what the papers claim, I know that it wasn't a date. No, it is not about the headline. Never mind. But since you brought it up, no it most certainly was not a date. It was just good food and good company. Yeah, good food and good company. Yeah, yeah. Well I'm glad we could clear that up. Not that it needed clearing up. No, exactly. So, then, why are we here? Right. I need your help. With some gift shopping. Christmas shopping!? Gift shopping. Here we go. Emily Lamb is the only name on this piece of paper. That's because Emily Lamb is the only person I need to shop for. Who is Emily Lamb? She works at the factory. I pulled her name at the Secret Santa. I'm sorry it's just kinda funny. The guy who doesn't celebrate Christmas is being forced to go Christmas shopping. For the last time, I said gift shopping. Okay. Gift shopping. But about your whole non-believer status? I think you would feel unburdened if you just told me why you don't celebrate Christmas. I doubt it. I'm serious, it'll be like I am sharing half of that burden with you. And how is that exactly? I don't follow. Right now you have 100% of it bottled up, contained inside of you. But by telling me, you will let go of 50% of it and be left with half of the burden you are currently carrying. Do you follow? Are you sure your math is correct? Well, actually with me, it's probably more than 50%, because I have been told I'm very empathetic. I don't think you're pathetic at all. Are you trying to be punny? Okay, but what if you think my non celebratory logic is stupid? I will be sure to tell you. Okay. My mother died before I was old enough to know her. My grandmother became more of a parent in my life and she made Christmas very special. Everything she did, it was the closest thing to magic that I've ever experienced and when she died, that magic faded. What about your dad? He was too busy running his empire. He never really let me be a kid. You know, I spent countless amounts of holidays after my grandmother's death completely alone. I'm sorry. As I get older, Christmas just ends up reminding me how much I miss my grandmother. And it ends up becoming something I try to survive rather than celebrate. But don't you think she'd want you to be happy at Christmas time? Yeah, I know she would be. But I haven't managed to find a way to do that yet, so. Well, you can consider me your own personal Christmas cheerleader. I know I will turn you around on Christmas. Is that a threat? It's a fact. Eventually I will wear you down. This just got interesting. Good morning Mr. Young! I'm sorry... Morning Mr. Mayor. Beautiful morning, isn't it? Indeed it is. Can I have a word with you? Sure. You know what I love most about this town? What's that? It's magic. Magic? Yeah, let me prove it to you. If I lived in any other town in the world I'm unemployable. But in this town, I'm the Mayor. Forgive me, no offense, but that doesn't exactly strike me as a selling point. What I'm saying is, is this is a special town. It's so special that everyone who lives here is special too. That's it's magic. And I'd like to share a little bit of that magic with you by inviting you to ride with us on the Christmas Carolvan. The Christmas Carolvan? It's an old unique tradition. You've never heard about this? Can't say that I have, sir. That's funny, cause your grandmother helped start it. Really? Yeah. You see, at the end of a factory day, a dozen workers decided to jump on the back of a flatbed truck and go Christmas Caroling. And every year since then, the Carolers and the truck have made their appearance, it's been getting bigger and better every year. Your grandmother was one of the original "Christmas Dozen" as we've come to call them. Christmas Dozen? I have it on solid authority from a local historian. She put it all together. In order to cheer up her grandson who was feeling a little down at Christmas time. That's... That's funny, I don't remember that. I'd be very honored if you'd ride with us tonight. Can I bring a friend? Riley? Yes. You two have been spending a lot of time together, hmm? We're not dating or anything, I mean that would be unprofessional. Mr. Young, you don't strike me as someone who plays by anyone else's rules other than your own. That's what I like about you. Thank you, sir. This evening, I'll see you? I'll be there will bells on. Ha-ha! Great! Thank you. Yes! Not such a scrooge after all. Hello? Hi Mom. In order to have a peaceful holiday season, I'm willing to overlook the argument we had the other day. Mom, please I told you I had to do this. I know, but you're my daughter and I'll always worry about you. It's my job. But I know you're an adult and as an adult you're responsible for your own decisions. Thanks Mom. That is very, well, it's very adult of you. You always had your father's sense of humor. Anyway, I'm glad you called, I sent you and dad a link to the factory website and I need you to forward it to everyone you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah we already did. I bought ten to give away as gifts. One to keep for myself and your father even put up on the store site. That's great. Alright Mom, I'm gonna call you later, okay? Right now I need to see a man about a sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. Clever. Hi. Hi! How do you feel about kids? If you mean do I want to have children of my own some day, well I guess that depends on the woman I end up marrying. Okay well thank you for your forthcoming answer but I specifically meant reading to them. I'd like to set up a meet and greet at the local school to have you read The Night Before Christmas to the Kindergarten class. You know my grandmother actually taught me how to read with The Night Before Christmas. Imagine that. So wait... Was that a yes? Because it sounded like a yes to me. That is a yes, I will do it. Great, because we are heading over there right now. How did you know I was gonna say yes? And don't forget your copy of the book! He sprang to his sleigh and to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight... Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hello boys and girls, ladies and gentleman. I heard someone reading my favorite story. Well hello Santa! Hello William, it looks like you got a room full of very good little girls and boys. I am certain that we do. And I'm looking forward to visiting each and every one of your homes on Christmas Eve. Now I have a secret I want you all to know. When the Elves at the North Pole are running behind on their Christmas list, we catch up on toys from the Young Toy Factory. The Elves refer to Dover as Toy Town. The Young Toy Factory is just as important to Santa as it is to the town. Thank you Santa, I will keep that in mind. I've got some candy canes here for my friends. There you go dears. Did you arrange for Santa to make an appearance? No, I thought maybe you did. Hello, Vance Industries. Hi, Vance Industries. The one and only. Great. Is Riley there? No, she's not home right... I mean she's not in the office today. I've stood here before my grandmother must have brought me along during one of my father's trips to the factory. It must have been the year my mother died. You know I gotta admit, I feel more at home here than I ever have in New York city. It reminds me of my home town. Oh, yeah? Where is that? Not far from here, town called Exeter. Did you... Did you leave anybody special behind when you moved to the big city? You mean besides my mom and dad? No. None of the guys I dated were keepers. Maybe I wasn't the keeper. Oh come on, you're totally a keeper. Yet none of my relationships lasted past Thanksgiving. Never had that special someone to share Christmas with. Well Riley I must say that there is one last thing that would help me feel more at home at this place. Okay, what's that? Christmas decorations. I can't believe it, I am not falling for that! It is a trick, like Lucy with the football. I'm serious and I know you kept them, didn't you? I did. I hid them in the garage. Okay. I know what you're doing. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Way to keep your cool. You made me drop an ornament! I just think that you've had enough. You're cut off, give me your keys. You can't cut me off from Christmas ornaments! I know, you're addicted. It looks great! Yeah. When was the last time you had your eyes checked? So what are your Christmas plans? Going home to see the folks. We have a whole schedule every year. Christmas Eve Dinner, the opening of a single present, Midnight mass, all the flourishes. How about you? To be determined. I usually go someplace warm. Pick a random spot on the map in a last minute effort to surprise myself. You go by yourself. Yes and it is rather peaceful. It sounds pretty lonely. Well I may be alone, but I'm never lonely. Not this year. You can't be alone on Christmas, I will not allow it. You can come home with me, there's an extra room over the garage, it's like its own apartment, my mother will love having someone to fuss over. She'll treat you just like you're part of the family. Sorry. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, we can be right there. Okay. What's wrong? Sales have hit a brick wall. We were doing great, the wishes were selling like hotcakes and then suddenly everything flatlined. How close were we? Just a little over halfway. I've been calling everybody, doing everything I possibly can to get the word out there to try to meet our sales goal... Sorry for the late notice. This is Rebecca Neston, she works at the local paper. She wants to publish a story to help us get the word out. This is Mr. Young. She knows a lot of people outside the town. Who's Riley Vanarden? What did you say? I said, who is Riley Vanarden? Because you're Riley Vance. Please don't do this. Not now. You thought that you hired Riley Vanarden, but really you hired Riley Vance and you'll notice that there's a significant difference in the two resume's. One is more Ivy League when the other's more, bush league. What is this about? It was a mistake. What do you mean a mistake? What is this? A simple mix up. The resume's got switched in my interview, I know I should have told you, and I wanted to tell you, but... Riley, I trusted you with details of my personal life I have never trusted anyone else with before. Do you know how difficult that is for me? Yeah, I know. I know you did, but you can still trust me. I can't trust you. I invested in this factory, in this town and more importantly in you. I never lied about who I was. I'm sorry. Could we have Miss Neston escorted off the property please? I have every right to report on this story. I don't allow Grinches in my factory, not ever. It's fine. Mr. Young, I apologize. I was just anxious to get the word out. Regardless of what is true about Miss Riley's experience or her name, she has a good heart. Without her, we would have been sunk, but now at least we got a chance of keeping this factory open so I hope you're gonna not let that slip away. Vance Industries. Yeah. Mr. Young. Hi. Heard what happened. Mind if I sit down? Of course not, yeah. I never get tired of this view. It's hardly The Grand Canyon. To me it is. Because it was from this very bench that I first saw my wife. Never forget it. I was sixteen and she was this vision disappearing into the Grocery Mart with her mother. It was right over there. Grocery store's gone, but she isn't. Well, I'm very glad that your life worked out all Norman Rockwell, but that's not my life. It could be. I've seen the way you look at her. I know that look. I had it right here. I nearly got frostbite waiting for her to come out. But I had to. Why's that? She was like the sun. Her beautiful smile just warmed me right up. And when she finally came out, I went straight up to her, started talking, I didn't know what I was saying, but I just kept talking, and we've been talking ever since. That's a nice story, but I'm having trouble seeing how that relates to me. Riley, she pretended to be somebody that she wasn't. And who would that be? A kind, caring person who wanted to save this town and just maybe Christmas for you? Maybe she's not the one who's pretending. Who do you want to be, Mr. Young? The man you are here or the man you are when you're with her? Take it from me, the bench is cold. Talk to her. So it's true. We hired the wrong girl? You hired the girl that impressed you in that room, no matter what her name or background or resume would suggest. I didn't even have a resume when your father hired me. I just, I wish that she would have come clean, that she would have trusted me enough to tell the truth. It's very difficult for me to let people close. And yet somehow, this one got close. Amanda, I've never had a woman challenge me like this before, you know? I mean you know what it's like when people find out my net worth, they can't see past it. Riley's never seen things that way. She's always seen me for who I am. What's this? Riley Vance's home address. This one's for you Grandma. I'm sorry to ruin Christmas. Honey, you can never ruin Christmas. Christmas is bigger than all of us. No one thing going wrong could ever possibly ruin it. Don't worry. Hey, you had a good ride, you took the hit so the town could thrive. Nothing but good can come from that. No, you were right Mom, I should have come clean from the start. I take no joy in being right. I wish I had been wrong. I would have rather it that I was wrong. The door. Be right back, sweetie. Hi. Merry Christmas! Riley... Mom, Dad, this is William Young. It's a pleasure to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Sir, how you doing? Good, you? Good. Riley, can we talk? Sure. I wanted to tell Amanda about the mix up but before I could I was in the conference room and the you hired me and I really felt like I could save the toy factory, so I was afraid if I told you at that point... Look, it doesn't matter. I understand. I know we're close to Christmas but could you please come back to Dover tomorrow? Let's finish what we started. Last box and we're outta here. Okay. What's going on? We sold off the last of the inventory. That's fantastic! This all happened last night? Yep. And William offered to make the last delivery himself. See you later. You made it! You did this. I decided to do some last minute Christmas shopping. It's a good thing that you did. This town is important to my family. It's important to me. But this was all your idea. I just provided the funds and that part is easy. Just buying time for everyone to have a nice Christmas. We can formulate a long term solution in the New Year but for now we need to keep this factory open. It's iconic, it's the flagship operation of Young Incorporated. We can meet with all the online majors in January and open up those new sales channels but in the meantime, what's most important, is delivering all these toys. So what do you say? Wanna come along for the ride? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Perfect, let's get you to work. Can you help me with this box? You know it's a good thing too because... Because Comet has a cold and we can use all the extra hooves on deck if you know what I mean? You know, my father felt that blood was stronger than performance, choosing to leave me the company over far more qualified individuals. You shouldn't underestimate yourself. Well what I'm saying is, at the end of the day, I want to do everything that I can to earn what my father left me. But I don't want to do it, and I can't do it without you. You're overqualified to be my assistant. What I want to do is set you up with your own consultant firm. We'll provide you the start up funds, but it will be entirely owned and operated by you. It will be your baby. My hope is that you will want to continue the work that you've done for the Toy Factory for several other Young Enterprises that need restructuring. - I'm floored. - So is the car. Okay, thanks. It's gonna be hours until the wreckers can get here. No need. I got this. Try starting it now. Okay. Do you have any other hidden talents besides auto repair that I should be aware of? You'll have to wait and see! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! There you go dear. Thank you Santa, thank you! And one for you too. Madison hasn't looked this happy since before she broke her leg. Well, I'm glad I could help, even if it's just a little. My goodness, I love giving out presents at Christmas time! You like getting presents? Ho-ho-ho-ho! Wonderful! Ho-ho-ho-ho! It's Christmas Eve! It's exciting isn't it? Can you feel it in the air? Like someone somewhere turned all of the Christmas lights all over the world on at the exact same time. Feels like Christmas Eve should. Like magic. We did it, didn't we? You did it. You saved Christmas for an entire town. It was a team effort, I was just the Christmas cheerleader. Maybe we can just chalk it up to a happy accident. There was no accident to speak of. I'm sorry that I betrayed you. Please, you've apologized like a hundred times already. I just don't know how all this happened. Kept digging myself deeper and deeper. Hey, it was for a good cause. I'm not talking about the factory. I'm talking about you. I just wanted to be around you all the time, it felt right. And I thought maybe I might be lucky enough to spend Christmas with you this year. And I wanted to tell you but things got messed up. Thank you, though, for everything you've done for me and for letting me finish what I started. Actually you're not finished. You're coming back to work for me and I will not take no for an answer. Well in that case Mr. Young, I accept the offer. Excellent, so we'll just have to approve your resume and then we'll be in business. Listen, I wanted to thank you for getting Christmas back to me as well. Well, it's tough to shop for the guy who has everything. Well I don't quite have everything, I don't have you. Riley, nobody has ever talked to me the way that you do. Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do. When I'm with you, I don't feel like William Young, I feel like me. I want to be the man that I am when you're around. I want you Riley. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
