FILOSOFI KOPI BRINGS MELAWAI BACK TO LIFE Angga. Yes? Tell Ben to only roast four kilograms today. Yes, sir. Here you go. Flores Tubruk. What's the philosophy? Tubruk coffee is innocent. A plain coffee. But after we get to know it better, it becomes very attractive. Look. You can see that Tubruk coffee doesn't care about appearance. It's also easy to make. We only have to brew it. But wait until you smell the aroma. Cool. Tubruk coffee. Okay. What about cappuccino? Why do you keep asking about cappuccino? Because it's delicious. It's a flirty coffee. The foam's thickness and texture have to be precise. Its look requires high standard. Cappuccino has to look very pretty. Because cappuccino is the perfect coffee for those who love beauty and gentleness. Cappuccino. Yes. You flirt. A cup of espresso. - Double espresso. - Right away. Hello? Yes, sorry. It was... The traffic was terrible. Yes, Indah? Hello? - Jody? - Yes? How was it? I'm tired. It's so tiring. Nobody wants it. Your shop's certificate. I'm so tired from talking so much to so many people. - Nobody wants it. - Nobody? Yesterday, I was with my dad's friend. We talked for hours and hours and he finally took pity on me. He's willing to give us 400 million rupiahs, but with four percent interest per month. That's crazy. Isn't that usury? You don't want it, right? Tell him I want 700 million rupiahs. That's a no go. I already gave him many excuses. Even made up some of them. Any that I could come up with. These days, nobody's interested in mortgages anymore. You're stubborn. I told you to sell it. Why don't you? If you sell it, the problem would be solved. How much can I get from it? - Just a billion. - That's a good price. One billion is great. After paying our debts, there will only be 200 million left. Then what? - Yes. - We can't even reopen Filosofi Kopi. What can I do? Sell pork noodles? I can't even make noodles. Save that 200 million. Use it to go on a vacation. You don't need to have a business or become a trader. Try to work for other people. That's pathetic. My dad's debt is bigger than his shop. Hey, don't talk about your dad like that. Do you know why your dad had so much debt? To raise and take good care of you. Your education cost wasn't cheap. Now, you talk like an ungrateful son. So annoying. Just work for other people. You're a foreign university graduate. Nowadays, a professional can get a job easily. I can work for other people. But what about Ben? I can't do that to him. I knew it. It's always about Ben. Who wants to work with someone like that? ...so you can play with fireworks. - Jody! - Hey, sir. I'm glad to see you. Why don't you seem glad to see me? - Come in. - Sure. Let's chat first. Just open the store later. Please be seated, sir. What time do you open? - What time? - Nine o'clock. - Please be seated. - Why not 24 hours? So that the youngsters can hang out here. You can also sell sausages. - Nowadays, people like sausage, right? - Yes. Isn't it a waste of energy to leave the lights on? But it's hot, the air-conditioning isn't on yet. - How's it going to be? - So what's the solution? You haven't paid for three months. - Yes, sir. It's... - Not even half of it. Nothing at all. What should I do? I also have a boss. - Yes. - What should I say to him? If you don't give me anything, then I can't help you. If I can't help you, then we're doomed. Yes, sir. But I'm stuck. Coffee price is currently very high. I've just told you to sell sausages. What would you like to drink? Espresso? Caffe latte? - Or cappuccino? - Anything. - I'll make you a cup. - Okay. Your store is big. Why don't you use half of it as a convenience store like it used to be? It'll be more profitable. Right, Ben? It's Jody. Jody. Where's Ben? He'll arrive soon. Can you do it? Yes, it's almost done. Why is it taking so long? Here you go. - What's this? - Do you want some sugar? You don't need sugar for an espresso. Do you think I'm stupid? I might look stupid, but I'm not. - What's this? - Espresso. - Are you sure? - Yes, it's double. What the hell is this? Is it not good? It's undrinkable. You're selling this? Who would want to buy it? If you can't make good coffee, sell something else that you can make. - I'll be waiting. - Yes, sir. Next month, okay? You don't even have air-conditioning. If you can't pay the rent, I'll have to bring these papers to the court. We won't meet here anymore, but at the police station. - Okay? - Next month. I promise. I don't need promises. Call me when the money is ready. No need to wait until next month. Okay? And make better coffee. - Okay, Jody? - Yes, sir. Hello, sir. Good morning. Do you want some coffee? You have so much style, but your coffee tastes bad. - Jody. - Yes? What did you make him? He said that it tasted bad. Corn coffee perhaps? Corn? Jody! No wonder he hated it. PHILOSOPHY OF TUBRUK, PHILOSOPHY OF MACCHIATO Cappuccino. What's your order? - The usual? Okay. - Me too. - Same. - Okay. - Handsome, right? - Very. Oh, gosh. - I'll be a regular. - Cappuccino and Americano. - He's mine. - No, mine. - Mine! - Okay. One almond, one cap, one M, one AM. One almond, one cap, one M, one AM? - What is AM? - Americano, Ben. Americano? But we don't have Americano. You know that. Look there. We only have Long Black. - Oh, you're right. Long Black. - Long Black? Carrot, cheese brownies, almond muffin. Name, please. - May I ask for a photo? - Sure. But be quick. It's crowded. - Okay? - Yes. Okay, thanks. Sir, what's the Wi-Fi password? We don't have Wi-Fi. You don't have it? You're kidding, right? Guys, no Wi-Fi. - You're serious? - No Wi-Fi? Cancel the order then. Okay. No Wi-Fi at this age? Okay. Let's go. Sorry, sir. Please cancel my order. - We're moving somewhere else. - Okay. - Jody. - I'm sorry. Where are they going? They canceled because we don't have Wi-Fi. No Wi-Fi? But I already made this. Damn it. I already made this. Those damn teenagers. Nana, take over for me. Ben, I've told you so many times that our income would greatly increase if we have Wi-Fi. Just trust me. Jody, you're out of line. Relax. Do it slowly. One at a time. Besides, I believe that good coffee will always find the people who love it. They're just words of wisdom. Ben, the problem is we need more money than what the coffee lovers can provide. Look. Who is our marketing target? Jakarta consumers. But they're used to drinking coffee while relaxing. Not drinking it during a heavy discussion. Do you know how much more money we would get if we have Wi-Fi? Double. Fine. If you don't want to install Wi-Fi, we should lower the cost of materials. Lower them? How? Currently, our cost of raw materials is too high. Look. The current average is 80,000 to 90,000 per kilogram. Other shops only spend 50,000 to 60,000 for one kilogram. Lower the cost to increase the margin. I disagree. That's it? I disagree. Damn you. Jody, don't be like that. We should never compromise on the quality of our raw materials. The fact is, currently, we're still buying coffee from suppliers. Not from auctions. Their coffees are more expensive. Fine. So what's your solution? Let's see. How are we going to pay three months worth of installment with our 800 million debt? We can't simply give the debt collectors free coffee. Your dad's debt is giving me a headache. This debtor was the person who paid for your education since you were twelve. I'm going home. The shape of your head is exactly like your father's. Including the shape of your jaw. Mr. Hermanto was one of my most loyal customers. He was friendly. And generous. Always gave me tips. Good people die young. Yes. Jody. It's early, but you already look defeated. My head hurts. Look. The financial report of the last two months. That's your fault. I've told you to spend more money for more expensive coffee beans. We'll get more customers because the coffee's good. Are you nuts? Why don't you look at this? How can we buy expensive coffee beans when we're broke? Hold on. I found this. Your toy. Good evening, Mr. Duboix. Hi, Elaine. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I've read your proposal and am very interested in it. Here's the book. Great. Coffee Around the World by Pierre Deschamps from 1999. Right. It's from more than ten years ago. But I'm sure most of its contents is still relevant today. And that's why I'm going to write its revision. All right. Or the updated version. This book will be a collaborative work of me and my late father. Okay. When will I be able to receive the first draft? Hey, help me. That one? - Mr. Norma. - Hey, Mr. Jody. - How are you? - I'm fine. What do you have? We have Lanang, Kintamani, Wamena. We also have Sidikalang. How much for Kintamani? Eighty-five. It's too expensive. Can you give me 70,000 if I buy wholesale? That's impossible. - Hello, sir! - Hi! My barista. - What types of coffee do you have? - Malabar, Ben. You've been looking for it, right? Unroasted, but is of specialty grade. Jody. How much for one kilogram? In an auction, it's usually 30 dollars. But for Filosofi Kopi, only 27 dollars. Too expensive. That's cheap, Mr. Jody. He's right. Why don't we try it first? We got a discount. This is zero defect, specialty coffee. You don't want to taste it? Jody. Why won't you taste it? You're so cheap, like Uncle Scrooge. You're mad! I'm going in first. I have many customers. Work well, my barista. - Oh, gosh. - Uncle Scrooge! - Anything else other than Malabar? - Wait a second. Give it to me. What's this? Aceh Gayo. Organic and processed naturally. When auctioned, the price is about 40 to 50 dollars. But for you... I can part with it for 25 dollars. I have 50kg inside. I'll just take two kilograms. Only two kilograms? Hey, two kilograms. Excuse me. Here's your coffee. - Thank you. - Sure. What kind of coffee is this? Gayo. Organic and processed naturally. Awesome! Isn't it expensive? It's just once in a while, and only two kilograms. And the selling price? We'll place an appreciation jar. So people can pay as they please. Great. That's unusual for you. Ben, let's go back. It's almost one o'clock. You're crazy. You speak as you wish. I'm still eating. Hey. Coffee shops don't close for an hour during lunchtime, Ben. Jody. - In Europe, almost... - "Almost all restaurants, coffee shops, and cafes are closed during lunchtime, Jody." I know, Ben. You've told me so many times. Ben, lunchtime is essential. If we're open during that time, we can sell 20 to 50 cups per day. It can increase our daily income up to two million. What do people seek after lunch? Coffee. Ma'am. - Ice tea. - Okay. Whatever. If you want to close during lunch, we'll just fire our waitress. To decrease the operational cost. You're crazy. - So cruel. - Excuse me. Nana has been working for us since day one. Since we opened. If we fire her, who will clean the tables? Who will wash the dishes? You? I can replace her. Aldi will be the cashier. We can't keep going on like this. We need a sacrifice. Something needs to be sacrificed. Hey. Listen to me when I'm talking to you. But you said that you were in a hurry. How much have we spent on lunch? The electricity bill increased. Gas price is 7,000 now. Next month, it might go up to 8,000 or 9,000. - My gosh. - When will we get profit? You can even discourage Uncle Scrooge, Jody. What about the cost of your rent? If we replace the glasses with paper cups, we won't need to wash them. Less work. You said you wanted to lower the cost. We'll need to buy those paper cups. Paper cups are cheap. They will only add 300 to the selling price. If we fire Nana, we can save - millions per month. - No way! We can't fire Nana. Fine, we'll have to open during lunchtime then. Ben. Hey! Okay, we will open during lunch hours. We can even be open for 24 hours. Like Starbucks. Why name it Filosofi Kopi? Because each type of coffee has its own philosophy. We can find every character and meaning of life in a cup of coffee. As long as there is coffee, people will be able to find themselves here. What's the meaning of coffee to you? To me, coffee is life. Is this Filosofi Kopi? Yes. How can I help you? My boss wants to meet the barista. FILOSOFI KOPI: NOT YOUR AVERAGE COFFEE SHOP Ga. Someone wants to meet Ben. - Call him then. - Are you serious? Yes, hurry up. Please wait a moment. We can't compare the sugar content in a cup of coffee with our bodies' sugar content. Excuse me, Ben. Someone's looking for you. - Just a moment. - Sorry. So are you the one who created all the coffee blends here? Yes. And the one who trained all of the baristas here. I'm here to give you a special challenge. What? A challenge worth 100 million rupiahs. The money will be yours if you win it. What do you mean? I challenge you to make the best house blend coffee in Jakarta. In Indonesia, if necessary. If you're as good as what the paper said. Just a cup of house blend coffee and I'll give you 100 million. And who will judge which coffee is the best? Someone. Ga, please serve him. Listen to me. I'm serious and I'm not crazy. I'll give this coffee to an investor to win a tender that I want. He's a coffee lover who went around the world just to drink coffee. If you accept this challenge and help me win this tender, I'll give you 100 million. What a lunatic. One hundred million, Ben? We can pay four months of installment with that much money. Don't tell me you rejected the offer. I haven't given my answer yet. Can I eat this? Do you know what this is? - What's this? - A card. A golden ticket, Beni. A golden ticket! With this, we don't need to worry about next month's payment. If this is a golden ticket, we won't have to worry about our debts anymore. This is money. Like that. The line's over there. I'll count. One, two. Hit it when I say that, okay? Can you do it? Try it slowly. Okay, over there. Do it again. Sir, your guests have arrived. This is Jody, my partner in Filosofi Kopi. - Hi, Jody. - Nice to meet you, sir. How is it? Is it good news? Yes, Ben told me about your offer. - Yes. - And... We have decided to accept the challenge. That's good news. The two of us have agreed, sir. - But on one condition. - What do you mean? Add one more zero on the check that you'll give. - Wait a minute. - If I win. - Hold on, Sir. - And if you fail? I'll give you a check with the same amount that you promise me. - No, sir. - You see, sir. I'm sure one billion means nothing to you compared to the tender that you're going to win. I must admit. I didn't think that you'd be this brave. But I like ambitious young men. Okay, one billion. Okay. - I'll be waiting for your house blend. - Sure. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. Have you gone insane? Damn it! Hey! I don't understand what's on your mind. Are you sick? Instead of 100 million, we'll get one billion from the challenge. That's it. Simple, right? If we win, we will be able to buy the lot behind the shop. We can build a cool place for a workshop and a barista school. And get coffee from Bangkok. I have a hard time following with what's in your head. Don't you understand our situation? If we lose, where do we get one billion? I'm not accepting this challenge to add more debts, but to pay them. I won't lose, Jody. But on one condition. One condition to the businessman and to me? Buy me the coffee beans that I want. The ones that you've never bought. That's all. How do you know that you won't fail? Because if there's one person who can make the best coffee in Jakarta or Indonesia, that would be me. Suit yourself. Just do whatever you want. We have no other choice anyway. Give me two weeks. Don't disturb me. And the coffee that I want? - Flores Arabica. - Awesome. Give me some. It has to be right. And with good acidity. Perfect. How is it, Ben? You're crazy. When was the last time you took a shower? You're the crazy one. My two weeks isn't due yet. It's fine. Since you're here, I want to share this with you. Look. We have to grind freshly roasted beans with a burr to maintain a consistent result. We've been wrong all this time. We shouldn't use a blade grinder. And to maintain optimal result, we can use a plunger pot or flat drip filter. When brewing with filtered water, the temperature has to be 96 degrees Celcius. No more, no less. It's to maintain the flavor and optimize the extraction. Speak human language, please. Okay, listen to me. I have found the best way to process coffee beans. With the best coffee beans that the market has to offer, I'll be able to make a cup of coffee with unrivaled flavor. I bet it on my ear. Right or left? Hey! You'll be the first to taste this coffee. I bet you will finally know the taste of an unrivaled coffee. On one condition. Another condition? You're annoying. Jody, if we win this one billion, I want Filosofi Kopi to be run according to my way again. I don't want my philosophy cards ruined by writings like "password, buy more coffee." How do you know that? Because I know you very well. You're a chance taker. When you see a chance, you take it. You always think about money. - It's all about money, right? - Okay. Ben, I've never doubted that you would be able to make the best coffee. But please stay focused. The amount of money in our bank account is decreasing. And you know that money is hard to get. Jody. I told you that we won't lose. Trust me. Awesome. Tomorrow come with me to the auction place. I need money to buy two more types of coffee. I'm dead. Or 1.8 billion will fly away. It's your choice. Okay. Remember, our budget's only 35 dollars per kilogram. - Maximum. - Yes. With hints of vanilla and orange. I want this one. It's so delicious. You should try it. Jody, this is very good. It has the flavor of orange. Jody. - What are you looking at? - What? - This one. - Nothing. What? This is delicious. - Clean aftertaste. Try it. - Welcome to Indonesian coffee auction. This is the one that I want. No matter what, I should get it. I must have it. Raise it! Raise it! Quickly! Hurry up! Hurry up, raise it! Jody, I don't care how you do it, but you must have this coffee. You can choose to ignore me, but without this coffee we'll have 1.8 billion debt and you're the one who will pay it. It's your choice. Remember that. Just raise it! It's good coffee. Raise it! Raise it! Quickly! Raise it! Raise it, Jody! Jody. 70 dollars. Treasure. Aldi! What kind of treasure? It's twice as high as our budget. - Come here. - You're killing me. I have a treasure for Filosofi Kopi. Have you ever seen me buying this much coffee? - Okay. - Jody. You should see his stunned face when I bought this treasure. Awesome! Amazing! Crazy! Amazing! One Perfecto. Okay. One single Perfecto. The texture is different. We're out of glass. Perfecto. - Okay. - Table three. One single Perfecto. Perfecto. One macchiato, one Perfecto. Refill of Perfecto. - It's ready. - This is Perfecto. - Our signature coffee. - Yes. Sorry. But how much is the salary of a senior barista here? - Jody! - It's okay if you don't want to answer. It's fine. I'll give it to you. Relax. He asked me about my salary. - Sir, this is the person. - No, this is very good. Just a little bland. It's all right. Thank you. - Thank you. - Yes. Bland? Is he crazy? Doesn't he understand coffee? You stated that Perfecto symbolizes perfection. What kind of perfection that you mean? The best. Perfection is a symbol of the highest score. On a scale of one to ten, Perfecto is definitely a ten. We have Gayo and we have... Whoa, cool. You must be Salembe. U-19, right? I know our national team players. I'm sure the creator of Perfecto can explain it better. Aldi, make him a cup of Ben's Perfecto. For free. - Ben! - Good night. Ben! Come here. Just a second. Ben, this El. El, this is Ben. El is traveling all over Indonesia to research about coffee. And we're talking about Perfecto. Yes. From which media? Not media. I'm writing a book. Yes, if I'm not mistaken, we met at the auction place, right? When it comes to pretty girls... Wait a minute. Just a minute. Hey, come here. Let me make the one for Salembe. Ben, make Perfecto for El. You only care about girls. Hold on, I'm making Salembe's. El is a Q Grader. Internationally certified. He's only a U-19 player. Hurry up. You can't boss me around. I learned that from alien. Hurry up. Sorry, El. Where were we? Perfecto is the symbol of perfection. So you think the score for Perfecto is ten? Yes. Unless there's a score higher than ten. I bet right now, Perfecto is the best coffee in Jakarta. Even in Indonesia. And currently Indonesia is the best coffee bean producer in the world. Are you saying that Perfecto is the best coffee in the world? On what basis? No, I'm not trying to bluff that Perfecto is the best coffee in the world. But for Jakarta, and even Indonesia, Perfecto's the best. Perfecto. Straight from its creator. - Please. - Please. Let's get back to Perfecto. So, you think that Perfecto can be very popular among Indonesian coffee lovers? - Yes, of course. - Wait. Wait. You haven't told me your opinion about Perfecto. I like it. What do you mean "not bad"? Do you mean there's a better coffee than Perfecto? So far, the best coffee is in Ijen. I was there two weeks ago. If I'm not mistaken, the name is... Tiwus coffee. So, you mean that this Tiwus coffee is better than Perfecto. Yes. Can you explain that woman's words? It's clear that she's insane. A runaway from a mental hospital. What kind of sane person compares coffee made from the best beans, prepared with the most sophisticated method with my years of experience and knowledge that I collected with coffee that is brewed by a village farmer? Explain it to me! A Q Grader, Ben. She's a Q Grader who said that Perfecto wasn't good enough for her. A Q Grader from where? That's just what she said. Besides, why do you trust the words of a food blogger? Because she has credibility. Read this. El is an internationally certified Q Grader. Look at the name of the institution. You recognize it? Is it familiar to a person who loves coffee? If it's not good enough for El, it wouldn't be enough for a coffee lover who has traveled around the world. Like that investor. Ben. If we lose, where would we get the money? Okay, so what do you want now? We'll find this Tiwus. No. What do you mean? I'm not coming with you. You have to. You have to prove this and counter El's argument. You have no choice. No way. I won't go with you. Ben, my fate, yours, and the shop's are now in your hands. If you won't come, we're doomed. I might not understand coffee. That's fine. But I completely understand my words. Right now, we've gone too far. And when trouble comes, you're going to run from responsibility. Why don't you just kill me? Damn. Even God is tired of you. I want to kill you. - Also take a picture of that part. - Yes. What did it use to be? A convenience store, sir. - Is the ceiling leaking? - No, that's the design. I see. What about the toilet? No, it's okay. I think we're done. Jody. Sorry, Mr. Gana. - Yes? - This is my partner, Ben. - Oh, hello. - Ben, this is Mr. Gana. He's the one who will help us sell the shop. Yes. This is my name card. Okay, Ben. So, tomorrow we will... - It's Jody. - Oh, Jody. Sorry. Jody, I'll contact you tomorrow. Around lunch hour. - We'll also talk about the placement. - Yes. - Okay, I'm leaving. - Yes, sir. Thank you. And Jody. I'll see you soon. It's Ben. Oh, Ben. Ben, I'll see you soon. What are you doing? I'm going to sell the shop. To pay our 800 million debt, plus the 1 billion that you lost. Hey, I'm not done speaking. What now? You think selling the shop will fix our problem? No one can fix your insanity, Ben. No, Ben. I can't follow your logic. But this is the only solution that I have. You're insane. What about the employees? Are we going to fire them all? You can't make decisions about this shop on your own. Of course I can. Why not? Did you forget whose money that we used to build the shop? The furniture, coffee machines, and beans were bought with whose money? Who bought that motorcycle that you're using every day? Who owns this place? There has to be another way. There is, Ben. You can come with me and El to find Tiwus. Other than that. You've known me for a long time. If there's anyone who knows me well, and all my flaws, that person would be you. You know how I feel about coffee plantation. I know about your trauma. But I can't allow what's already ruined to get even worse. Okay, Ben. You deal with your own problem. Let me deal with this problem my way. How troublesome. Two Maraschino. I'll contact you again later. Na, what happened? Are you all right? We don't want any oil palm here. What the hell? Don't take away our rights! - This is our plantation! - Step aside! This plantation is ours! I don't want oil palm plantations! Shut up! Have mercy! What's wrong? Na? Na, are you all right? Sorry, Mr. Jody. I was panicking. I just got news that my husband got into an accident. He's in the hospital now. I'm sorry. Yo! Yo. I told you not to take the motorcycle. Why didn't you take the bus? You never listen to me. - Doctor. - Yes? How are his injuries? Quite serious. Is there a chance that he'll need surgery? Yes, he might need it. Excuse me. You hear that? We only have enough money to pay next month's rent. Now we also have to pay for your surgery. With what? Where will we get the money? Okay. We'll go find Tiwus. Are you serious? Now what? I'll talk to El. Just relax. Since when have you been writing about coffee? Actually for a long time. But I used to only publish them on my blog. Why are you laughing? Nothing. You sounded like a native even though you've been living in France for so long. I lived in Indonesia until middle school. Besides, I often return to Indonesia to visit my grandma and my friends. I also have a few clients in Jakarta. Any story from your time in France? -When I was in middle school, -Yes. I loved to wear makeup because my mom finally allowed it. - Thanks. - Each day, I wore different cute dresses. And then, one day, my dad brought me to La Boutanche. He didn't tell me that the weather there is very unpredictable. I wore a short sleeveless dress. Suddenly, a cold and strong wind blew. And then it was raining hard. Hey! I ran back to the hotel while shivering, but I got lost since I didn't know the way. I was panicking. So much that I entered a restaurant. Everyone was staring at me because I was drenched and shivering from head to toe. And then? A guy helped me. He lent me his jacket. But instead of thanking him, I cried. He was scared of being accused as a molester. Of course. I only stopped crying when he bought me a croissant and lent me his phone to call my dad. He stayed with me until my dad picked me up. Then we got to know each other and ended up dating. First love? Do you have a boyfriend now? I'm going out. Bullshit. What's that for? Excuse me. Mr. Seno. - How are you? - I'm doing fine, thank God. Do you still remember me? I came here last month for an interview. - Oh, Ms. El? - Yes. - Yes. - I'm here with my two friends. Jody and Ben. They're very curious about Tiwus coffee. So I brought them here. Then, please be seated. Yes, sir. I'll make you some coffee. - Sit down. - Yes. The plantation is so vast. Where's Mr. Seno's plantation? Up there. Come. Here they are. Drink it while it's hot. Go ahead. Go on. - Thank you, sir. - This is for Ms. El. These peanuts are very crunchy. See? I told you so. This is the best coffee that I've ever drunk. Really? You only love it because the view is beautiful here. Or maybe you love it because you're accompanied by two handsome guys. - Mr. Seno. - Yes? I have a coffee shop in Jakarta. I actually don't quite understand about coffee making. However, I believe this is the best coffee that I ever had. What's the secret? Well, none. Tiwus coffee is just an ordinary coffee. I don't believe it. What about the roasting method? The fertilizer? Soil moisture? Land steepness? There has to be a secret. Perhaps, this is it. My wife is a Gayonese who knows coffee very well. And I come from a generation of coffee farmers. So I'm used to working the land. Ma'am. - How are you? - Ms. El. I'm fine. Go ahead. - Thank you. - This is my wife. These kids want to know the secret of Tiwus coffee. But there's none, right? We once considered to use industrial fertilizer, but they're not good for the plants. - Yes. - So we nourish them with traditional methods. It's generally the same with taking care of other living things. Like ourselves. Humans and animals. They also need love. It can't be that simple, sir. All right. Why don't you prove your words to me? I will pay you any amount of money if you're willing to show me the process of making Tiwus coffee from the beginning. From the beans. Because I find your words hard to believe. I need to see it with my own eyes. I have to see your plantation. Do you mean that we have to go to the plantation first then return here to make coffee? It's doable, but it will take time. That's not an issue, sir. We'll go to the plantation then. - Let's go. - Come on. Excuse me. Ben. Ben, come here. Ben, I didn't bring you all the way here just to insult Mr. Seno. I'm not insulting him. I just want to know. Ben, I don't know what's on your mind. But I don't like the way you're treating Mr. Seno. Ben! - Can we leave now? - Let's go. Do you want to come? I've already seen it. I've been friends with him for more than a decade. It's the first time I see him act like this. Ever since he was young, he has always been obsessed with coffee. His dad was a coffee farmer who passed down all his knowledge to Ben. There was an incident that I can't recount to you in detail. But it made Ben the way he is now. Ben, are you all right? I'm fine, sir. You're sweating profusely. - Yes. - Do you need to drink? It's alright, ma'am. Let's just continue on. Come here, Ben. Look. This plant has fewer branches than the others. It's because I cut down the branches every day, so the flowers and coffee beans can have a place to grow. To get enough nutrition. If coffee beans get enough nutrition, they will grow healthily. Ben. Remember. -For coffee plants, -Yes, Dad. the most important thing is to cut its water sprout immediately before they turn into branches. In order to ensure they get good nutrition... Like this one, it needs to be cut. Just like what I told you. Coffee that has high nutrition will be healthy. And when we brew and drink them, the flavor will be amazing. And also this one. I'm home. Welcome home. Ben, I'm going to the mosque. - I'm leaving. - Take care, Mom. Ben, where's your dad? Dad, someone's looking for you. - Mr. Sus. - What's wrong? - It's your wife, sir. - What happened? - Hurry! - What happened to my wife? - In the plantation. - What? - Hurry up. - Ben, guard the house. Hurry, sir. What happened? Sir, what's wrong? Go away! Don't touch her! Mom! Let me go! Mom! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Mom! Let me go! Let me go! Grow healthily and produce many flowers. Dad, here's your coffee. Look here! Don't touch these things! I told you not to touch it! It's mine! Murderer! Ben is the smartest person that I've ever met. But lately, I feel like I don't know him anymore. He reminds me of someone. My late father. The hardest person to understand. He always lived in his own world. In school, when the teacher told us to write about our dad, I didn't know what to write. Then I realized that I never knew my own dad. I thought everything would change when we moved to Bordeaux. New environment, new place, new country. But no. He left home more and more often. Sometimes for days, even weeks, and in the end, I only met him two days a month. Sometimes even less. He promised to attend my 18th birthday. But even after the party ended, he didn't come or even call. When he got home, I was furious at him. He apologized, but I couldn't forgive him. I said that I didn't have a dad. The next day, he left for Peru to continue his research for his second book. He never came back. They found his plane one week later. Sorry for that. It's okay. I can also feel what you're feeling. If I may be honest, Filosofi Kopi is actually part of my effort... to have revenge on my dad. I didn't hate him. But ever since I was a kid, I was never free to decide who I wanted to be. He controlled everything. I had to do what he said. I only found out that he had a huge amount of debt after he died and... Since then, it has been my burden and the shop's. I never understood what he did. My dad once told me that one day I'll understand. Is it done, sir? I'm going to make some coffee for Ben. Come. Here it is. Come, Ben. Here you go, Ben. Ben, remember. Coffee beans need to be roasted the right way. Don't roast them too much. Or they'll lose their flavor. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Mr. Seno. If I may ask, why did you name it Tiwus? Why not, for example, name it Seno coffee? Tiwus was the nickname of our daughter. Does she also live in this village? She died a long time ago. Not long after we moved here. A plague spread through the villages. She just had her birthday. Celebrated it with her school friends. Yes. She cried when we told her that we were moving away. She didn't want to move. If only we followed her wish, she might still be alive right now. But it's all right. It's all in the past. It's useless to regret. No matter what we do, it won't bring her back. Tiwus loved to play in the coffee plantations. And after she was gone, we tried to change the coffee plantation to be like her. If Tiwus was alive and saw how hard the two of you have worked, she would have been very proud. If... Just if... If... Tiwus was still alive... We only want to say one thing. That... we're only imperfect parents. I actually only want to say one thing. We want to apologize. Apologize to Tiwus. How much for this coffee? There's no need to pay. It's for free. Please, sir. Just tell me how much. I told you that I would pay. You don't need to. It has no price. Ben. Excuse me, Mr. Seno. Ben! Ben. I'll bring Tiwus to Jakarta. What for? To serve to the businessman and his investor. I know you hate the fact that we're not using Perfecto. But I need you to see this from a wider perspective. Tiwus is the only thing that can save us now. That means the one billion belongs to Mr. Seno. What do you mean? Tiwus belongs to Mr. Seno, it's not ours. He's the coffee farmer. But you're the one who'll make it. We'll use Tiwus coffee beans and the Perfecto method. Besides, the challenge was given to us, not Mr. Seno. It doesn't matter. If we use Tiwus coffee beans, the one billion will have to go to Mr. Seno. I'm sure there are other ways to pay him. We can give him a share of our money. Or we can bring Mr. Seno to Jakarta. We make him a barista at our shop. - No more problem, right? - You're insane. Hey, I never joke about coffee. Now you want to pretend to be ethical. Give one billion rupiahs to a farmer? You don't even care about our shop's debt. You didn't care when I have to pay the installment each month. Who created this problem of one billion? You're not the only one who has been working hard. Don't you appreciate me? Why do you think I worked hard every night to create a new blend? Who do you think I made Perfecto for? Who am I here for? You know that our shop has many customers. Because of who? Do you know? Listen carefully. Filosofi Kopi wouldn't exist without me. Without my investment and my dad's money. You can be a barista, because of who? Because of me! If my dad didn't take you in and send you to school, you would be a beggar on the street! Ben. What do you want? What do you mean? What do you want by coming to our shop and destroyed all the efforts that Jody and I had built for years? If you didn't come, everything wouldn't have turned into a mess like this. Ben, calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! My patience is running thin. I won't let someone like you destroy Filosofi Kopi. Are you afraid that I won't say Perfecto is the best coffee in Indonesia? Do you know how much time and effort I put in to create Perfecto? Do you know how much money I spent to create it? Do you know how it feels to be looking for the perfect coffee for years? To be the best, do you know? So, because you've put so much time and effort on the shop, you feel that the universe has to follow your will. Hey, watch your mouth... If you feel like you had done your best, then perhaps you should accept the truth that Perfecto isn't perfect. You compare yourself with Mr. Seno. But it's not about knowledge or experience. You make coffee with obsession. Mr. Seno does it with love. That's the difference between you and him. Do you still want to fight here? I'm sure they won't stay silent. Let me open the door for you. No. It's okay. Let me. Yes. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Seno. - Yes. I'll arrange for the shipping of the next purchase. I hope everyone will like it. I'm absolutely sure, sir. Tiwus coffee is the best coffee in Indonesia. It's not just the coffee beans. The blender also plays an important part. Bye, sir. Take care. - Bye, ma'am. - Bye. - Thank you, sir. - Be careful. Bye, ma'am. I'm leaving. Welcome. Let me take you to the meeting room. He has been waiting for some time. The apartment has two towers with a futuristic design. The two of them are connected by a sky bridge on the 25th floor, along with a lounge. If you want to sell something, you need to be enthusiastic. What was that again? So you can imagine the view from the 30th floor. I love the aroma. Are you a coffee lover? Yes. - I love... - Liar! If you're a coffee lover, when you heard that sound... The aroma. Where's the coffee? May I try it? Specially for you from Filosofi Kopi. - Thank you. - Please try it. One billion, Beni! Our debt is cleared! You know what this means? We can use the 200 million that's left to buy the lot behind the shop and do a major renovation to the shop. Hey, Ben. What do you want? Coffee? Tebala? Malabar? Which one? We can even buy all the beans from the auction place if necessary. Elisha? Ben. We even can pay for Nana's husband's surgery! That was my last cup of coffee. What? I will no longer blend coffee. I'm resigning from the shop. - Ben. - I never joke about coffee. I don't understand what's in your head. We can talk about this nicely. Ga, I put the shop in your hands. Why? Hey, take care of this. - Work hard. - Where are you going? - Ben. - Keep learning. Ben, don't be childish. It's not about you and me. It's about me and myself. I'll leave you the key to my house. I'll pay all my debts to you in small amounts. Thank you for everything. Ben. BACK INTO HIS ARMS IN HEAVEN, HERMANTO HENDRAWAN Ben. Ben. Ben! Ben? How much longer? Shut up. This is the right measurement. Take a look at this. Beni Susilo's coffee. You're the best coffee maker in Jakarta. No, in the world! Show it to the camera. Okay, look at this. The aroma is mouth watering. - Bring it here. - Be careful. It's hot. It's hot. Hold it carefully. One, two, three. Step aside! Live in Ben. It's "made by." The one and only. - The one and only. - Hey, don't push me! - Step aside. - Shut up. Step aside! You're obstructing me. Make me some coffee. It's been so long since the last time I had coffee this good. Too long. Only you can make coffee taste this good. I never had the chance to tell you all this. My condolences. Be strong, sir. May she rest in peace. IF YOU DON'T STOP, YOUR SON WILL BE NEXT. - Hello, Mr. Jody. - Hi, Mr. Aris. How are you? It's been a while. Yes, I was busy with my dissertation. My dad and I haven't met for five years. I brought him here to try Ben's coffee. Ben's not here right now. Where is he? - What do you want to order? - Just Tubruk coffee. - Tubruk coffee? - Yes. Malih, please make Tubruk coffee. - And one cappuccino. - Okay. - Tubruk, cappuccino. - How much? Forty-eight thousand. - Cappuccino and Tubruk coffee. - That's all. It's just once in a while. Okay, thanks. Please wait a moment. - Yes. - Let's go, Dad. Hey, Jody. - You were daydreaming! - El! You're drenched. How are you? It's been a while. - Have a seat. - Sure. I came to say goodbye. And to drink Tiwus coffee. - Do you still have any? - We still have a lot. Malih. My name's Malik, sir. Right, I forgot. Malik, a cup of Tiwus coffee. What method do you want? - V60. - Just a minute. So? You're already leaving Indonesia? - Why so soon? - Yes. Thank you for the conversation we had at Mr. Seno's. You're welcome. I'm also glad to be able to tell you about my dad. Because it's impossible to tell it to Ben. Here's your coffee. Thank you. Where's Ben? Ben has left. He said he no longer wanted to make coffee. Are you serious? Yes. Since we returned from Mr. Seno's place, Ben has changed. Back in the days, a day without arguments between us was very rare. What's wrong, El? This is Tiwus coffee? Yes, it is. It tastes different. Very different from the one that we drank at Mr. Seno's. Are you sure this is Tiwus coffee? Yes, but it's made by a new barista. Not Ben or Mr. Seno. You can't only use your head to make coffee. You have to use your heart. There's SDN Niwa. Where is Ben? Hey, Scrooge! - What are you doing here? - Hi, Hairy! Dad, that's Jody. - Oh, yes. - I told you about him. I came here to bring you back to Jakarta. Now I know why we never agreed about the shop. Here, drink this coffee. Thank you, sir. Sorry for bothering you. No, you're not. I'm the one who bothered you. You took care of him for 18 years. Try it. Coffee straight from its creator. Amazing, right? It is amazing. Awesome. Ben. You and I are like the heart and mind. Each of us has our own problem. But one cannot survive without the other. I always try to keep Filosofi Kopi going. But it needs the soul to survive. And... I only have this. Do you mean I don't have it? You're such a jerk. Will you return to Jakarta with me? I like it here. The air is cool and fresh. It's not hot and there is no traffic like in Jakarta. And no Wi-Fi. There it is. Ben. If you really love coffee, don't stop. I'll be all right on my own. We no longer have coffee here. Only vegetables. The important thing is, now you remember that you have a home. SOLD Hey, coffee guy! - Ben! - Hi! What the hell? What's gotten into you? It's time for me to move on and forgive my dad. So I sold the shop. Did you forget that I'm still in here? - How could I? - You forgot me. Hi! Beni. The best coffee has to be shared. You're possessed. - From Tiwus' dad. Stock for one month. - Crazy! Mr. Seno also sent his regards. He still agrees. He said we can't compare coffee with sugarcane juice. No matter how perfectly you make Perfecto, no matter what beans you use, - coffee is coffee. - Coffee is coffee. - It always tastes bitter. - Even if we use Tiwus beans. - Beni! Let's go! - This is crazy. - Let's bring coffee to all over Indonesia. - Okay! Let's go! I have also fulfilled your conditions. I already gave Mr. Seno his share. So? We're going around Indonesia. - Bali! - Bandung! - Yogyakarta! - Surabaya! Everywhere! Let's go! PHILOSOPHY OF PERFECTO "SUCCESS IS A PERFECTION OF LIFE." PHILOSOPHY OF TUBRUK "KNOW IT BETTER, THEN YOU'LL BE AMAZED BY IT'S CHARM OF INNOCENCE." PHILOSOPHY OF CAPPUCCINO "BALANCE AND BEAUTY ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCCESS." PHILOSOPHY OF TIWUS "NOTHING IS PERFECT, BUT LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL AS IT IS." PHILOSOPHY OF MACCHIATO "WALK THROUGH IT ALONE OR TOGETHER, LIFE WOULD BE STILL MEANINGFUL." PHILOSOPHY OF COFFEE Okay, last question. You traveled around Asia to write this book. Is there any unforgettable or interesting experience that you want to share with all of us? I traveled around Asia to find coffee, but I found myself instead. I met many amazing and experienced coffee experts, but the most unforgettable ones were my meeting with simple people who dedicate their lives for the love of coffee. They taught me to make peace with myself. Thank you. May I have your signature right here, Ms. El? Thank you. I'm not only asking your signature on this book. But I also want to ask for permission to get to know its writer better. Sir. Here. Gayo coffee, processed naturally, medium body, bright acidity. Hey, were you listening to me? Why are you taking pictures? - It's prohibited? - Of course. Do you think it's an artifact? It's served with the right temperature. - So you'll get the best flavor. - Just get in. It'll get cold if you wait! - Hey! - Sir, over there. - New arrival. I have Malabar... - Just a second, Jody. - What are you doing? - Taking pictures. - Who told you to take pictures? - Myself. What for? I don't need publication. - Enjoy it. - One espresso! - Yes, sir. - Okay. Malabar, okay. Damn you, it won't sell. Subtitle translation by Shelomi Angeli
