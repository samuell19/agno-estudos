It's time to recognize that we've come to a turning point. We're threatened with an economic calamity of tremendous proportions and the old business as usual treatment can't save us. Together, we must chart a different course. Okay Ron, take us back to 1982. I was unemployed and heard about the billboard contest and I don't know, wasn't working, was looking for work and didn't have any, so. Something to do. How often do you think about the contest? Not very often. It's just part of the past. It was 30 years ago. I don't think it was that big a deal. You know, you were up there, you did what you had to do and when you came down, it should have been over with. Everyone else seems to find it a whole lot more fascinating than we do. For the better part of a year now, Allentown, Pennsylvania has been receiving international publicity. We compare this almost to Orson Welles "War of the Worlds". Some of the magazines say it was bigger than "The War of the Worlds". It was that story that was so unusual. All I can say is I'm not coming down until I got a house. He was up there longer than we were married. What do you do to keep yourself busy? The temperature has dropped to zero in February. Most snow, 24 inches. You must be talking to yourself. These two gentlemen out there on the platform have said that you're exploiting them. Who's exploiting who here? You had all the elements of a great story. It's a perfect story. It was just so different and so unique. It wasn't written by a fiction writer. It really happened. There's no way I can explain it. Once The Wall Street Journal hit, everything changed. You've got three guys that did something crazy to try and just get a little bit ahead of the world. You can tell the story of the United States through that billboard contest. You can't make this stuff up. Who could dream this up? When I look back 30 years at this story, I love it. Eh. This wasn't supposed be this. It wasn't supposed to be this big international global almost year long thing. It was supposed to be a way to get people to know we had changed our format, look at our billboard and give away a modular home for a sponsor. That's what this was supposed to be. But that's not what it was. You got to remember that this is ground zero of the rust belt. Steel's gone, Mack Trucks is threatening to leave. People were looking for work, people were looking for better times, better days. And that was a big part of this. This is kind of like a rust belt fairytale. I regret to say that we're in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression. Our inflation rate was phenomenal. We were in double digit and high double digits inflation. Here is a dollar such as you earned spent or saved in 1960. And here is a quarter, a dime and a penny, 36 cents. That's what this 1960 dollar is worth today. You had high unemployment rate. You also had interest rates 20%. Even if you had a job, if you didn't already have a house, you really weren't gonna be able to get a house. So it was a time when people were really scrambling and trying to hang on to this American dream. What's happened to that American dream of owning a home? I mean the American dream was really shaky at that point. Your standard of living is going down. "Sleigh Ride" Loretta Anderson at 1470 WSAN. Well WSAN was coming off being a country station and becoming a nostalgia station. So we were looking for something that would make the billboard that we could afford stand out. How about a living billboard? At first it seemed like a grand idea for promoting the local radio station. There'd be gigantic pouting lips in orange call letters rocketing into view, WSAN Unforgettable. We did this because we switched formats to Unforgettable and we wanted to contest that would be unforgettable. The station is advertising its switch from country tunes to nostalgia mood music. So the billboard shows a pair of big red lips meant to remind the listener of his first kiss. The contest, reminiscent of a depression era flagpole sit, is the latest promotional brainstorm of Harold G. Fulmer III, the multimillionaire owner of radio station WSAN. Harold Fulmer is an interesting guy. Harold's an interesting guy. HGF, Harold G. Fulmer III, "The McMillionaire." He started working in a McDonald's. Worked his way up manager there. By the time he was 21, he had purchased that McDonald's. He is the sole owner of 14 McDonald's franchises, a hotel, a printing company, Sky King airways, Kutztown Airport, 1,100 rental apartment units and some 250 commercial properties. The 42 year old Fulmer usually sports a 10 gallon hat, a fat cigar and the biggest Western style suit in the Lehigh Valley. At six feet three inches high and 300 pounds wide, he seems to have swallowed all of his McMillions for safe keeping. Hardold Fulmer was a bigger than life type of a guy. Fulmer owns 140 antique and collectible automobiles, including Goldfinger's Rolls-Royce. He was half Horatio Alger and half PT Barnum. He thinks of himself as a promoter, the guy who goes around putting up the signs before the circus comes into town. He doesn't bother to explain that he's also the guy who owns the circus, very much like PT Barnum, who invented the kind of publicity that in the depression produced flagpole sitters and marathon dancers. They let the entire party skip through everything. Yeah, it is trouble. I feel a limp coming on now. A big part of radio is contests and a big part of morning radio is wacky contests, so. Rick brought an idea about the billboard contest and that kind of intrigued Hal and myself and from there we began to build it out. At that time, it was totally unheard of. You had FM radio stations playing music with really nice fidelity and then you had us playing music. So you had to be a little bit different, right? It's time to try something different. And in this contest, well, that was a little different. Day after day, week after week, month after month, they wait. Three men living on a billboard in Allentown. What are they waiting for? Each is waiting for the others to say I've had enough, I'm coming down. The one who stays up there the longest wins an $18,000 mobile home. Love Homes is sponsoring the contest. They're donating the home. It was a stunt to bring attention to the mobile home business. It's a cozy comfort home is what it's called. It's a manufactured home, which means it's placed on a foundation. Last one down gets the modular home. There were meetings like, okay, we're gonna have to have a contract for these contestants. What are the rules of the contest gonna be? How do they shower? How do they eat? How do they do anything, right? The contestants were given a tent, a telephone and 20 square feet to call home. They had a rope and a bucket. They had to get their own meals, that was part of the deal. The competitors can't have booze, dope or TV sets. They can't bother one another and they can't come down. Except for the sponsors and an occasional reporter, no one can go up. We gave them phones primarily, that was the social media outlet at that time. They gave us a sleeping bag, a small portable radio, a phone and the portable shitter and that was pretty much it. Really on a billboard, there's only so much you can put there. Can't put hot tubs or that type of stuff in. I was on the air the evening we announced the contest. So we had a little light, a little yellow light that let us know the request line was being called in and the thing was blowing up, it just never stopped flashing. Like the minute I walked in the door from the army, you know, it was like, I don't think she said anything else, but it was there's this contest going on and you should enter. He entered because his mom entered him. She typed on one eight and a half by 11 piece of paper. I could live in indefinitely on a billboard. We didn't have a limit on how many times you can enter. She did it twice on one sheet and then ran off 500 copies and then cut 'em in half and sent off 1,000. And I thought that was a lot until I heard how many Ron and Mike had entered. My dad had a teletype and we just typed it in once and it just Kept printing it out. I think we were trying to for 4,000. When we added it up, he came up to 4,004 so that's what we sent in. The chance to win it big and everything just didn't exist. You know, today you look around, you got lotteries all over the things, you got all these other reality shows, "The Voice", "Ninja Warriors", I mean there wasn't any of that there. So this was some excitement. Michael wanted to make sure that he got picked so we made a lot of entries. It was one of those gray autumn afternoons when the sky turns the color of machine parts. Mike MacKay and his wife, Linda, were tooling home and their five-year old Ford Granada listening to WSAN. "Just explain in 25 words or less, why you want to enter", said the voice on the radio. "Last one down wins." Shit, MacKay thought, why not? He was made for this kind of stuff. At 31 Mackay figured that the only way he'd ever be able to afford a home was to get it for free. When he got home, he scrawled out his 25 words or less entry. It was only four words. I need a home. Married just a year, the MacKay's worked as house parents caring for three retarded children. When they heard about the contest they wanted to help out. MacKay needed a strategy to ensure that his name would be drawn and the one he hit upon was overkill. He ordered a rubber stamp with I need a home engraved on it and used it 7,000 times until the words became an incantation. One person would cut it and the other person would fold it and then we'd put it in a bag. Three weeks later, MacKay felt more secure, but he still wasn't satisfied. He shuffled over to Love Homes with a fist full of entries. "Oh, you'll need more than that if you expect to win," the man told him. So every day for the next week, MacKay showed up at WSAN with two, sometimes three shopping bags full of entries. Mr. MacKay entered the contest 47,000 times. 47,000, yep that sounds right. "He really feels this is the only way we can get a house," says his wife, Linda. The promoters received 600,000 entries from which the three contestants were chosen. The day of the drawing, we went to the radio station and we were just standing there with the rest of the crowd. When the chief of police of Whitehall Township began snatching the winning entries from the piles at his feet, the first 10 he drew said, "I need a home." He was like, yes, I knew that was gonna happen. I was like, oh no. I think I heard it on the radio in my car and when I stopped, I called him and said, you know, you're in, you're in and he said, I know. My one sister ran into me at the gas station and said, "Hey, you know they announced that you could be in a contest. You got to call them within so many hours." And I said, "Okay, yeah call." Ah, MacKay. Mike was entertaining and he knew he was entertaining and he set out to begin entertaining, which made it all fun because we all understood. You never knew what that guy was gonna do. It's like you pull the string on the back of his neck and you know, which MacKay is gonna come out? It went from the MacKay to MacKai. Mike MacKay was the one that loved it the most. He loved being Billboard Mike. He liked that title. Well, Mike MacKay said I'm a people person. He said, "I wake up in the morning looking for a hand to shake." Yeah my first impression of Mike was that he was kind of a win-back, kind of full of bluster. I'm thinking we both had sort of a similar opinion on Mike. A self-promoter and a bit arrogant. I believe he was a player. When you talk about some of the reality shows that are going on now, "Survivor" or something, you know how they have to be players, that would have been a perfect fit for MacKay. Mike was the ring master. It was come join the circus, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, journalists of all ages, come see Mike MacKay. I think Ron Kistler was determined, you know, just the quiet warrior. I was just up to get the house, not attention. Kistler was a man of few words, but he chose those words very judiciously. And I remember he said to me, he was the man in the middle and he said, "The good thing about that is I get to talk to both guys" and the bad thing about that "is I have to listen to both guys." Kistler is a shy man with a touch of baby fat, limp blonde hair and skittery hazel eyes. He looked like a boy scout. He's such a young guy and he said, but he was starting to grow a beard. And he said, "Yeah, I'm starting to grow a beard. I thought it would be something to do." That's a good picture of you. That's a nice one. There's only like 400 of 'em here. Eventually you're gonna get a good one. Ron Kistler would be the kind of guy if you want somebody to be in a foxhole with you, I would pick Ron Kistler Mr. Kistler says he will stay put for however long it takes. Ron was just so chill, he's gonna stay up there as long as it takes. You know, if I had to put money on who would come down last, it would be Ron, that's who I would have bet on. I'm sure there were bets on people. Mr. Young is 22, single and just out of the army. When he heard of the contest, he postponed his job search. "I was looking for a job that was closely related to what I'd done in the army," he explains, "and this was about as close as anything I could find." I don't know that anybody ever quite got Dalton. Dalton was a laid back kind of guy who was up there for reasons that I really was never quite clear on. I wasn't set up to have a home at that point. I was 22, I just got out of the army. I wasn't ready for that. So I just wanted to be a part of their competition and win it. And his mother said, "The great thing about this is I know where he lives and he's always home." Well, you know, and a real selling point was when she said that if it went on long enough that the Guinness World Record Book would be involved. And I said, "Yeah, that's that's for me." I don't know that he was loving it and I don't know that he was the quiet warrior. I don't know if he was just kind of meandering through the contest. And ironically, he may have been the one who stayed the longest if it ever got to that point, but it didn't. The very first day was like, oh, it was raining, it was kind of like crappy out. I thought wow, I'm gonna do this for like a month? This is a little crazy, you know? I had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be about a 30 day event. You know 30 days and done, but that's not how it happened. They thought I'd be up against like a middle-aged housewife and like a high school kid or something, you know? And I get up there and I mean these guys are competitors. The one guy is like a backpacker or an outdoors man. Ron's like a big time hunter and camps out and stuff. You know what I mean? Like what were the odds of that happening, you know, that we'd be so evenly matched? So it was supposed to be a local radio promotion for a local radio station and the first day, contestant goes up wearing a Philadelphia radio station. So suddenly it's not quite so local anymore. He's doing a promotion for another radio station, right, and he's wearing a MMR tee shirt and we get wind of it. So we hear about this guy, we go, "Let's get him on the air, we'll have him do the weather. He's on a billboard in Allentown. If anybody knows about the weather this guy does." And then I just said, "You know what? We'll just call him again tomorrow." And the bit became check-in with Dalton, but who expected it to go on for as long as it went on? When the spectators left and the three men finally settled down in the chill and nagging rain, the noise of the traffic from the exit ramp off I-22 where they were perched, began to invade their consciousness. Overhead, military and civilian aircraft ferry down the flight path, heading for Allentown Bethlehem Easton Airfield. At 800 feet and descending, a Boeing 737 makes enough noise to cause blurred vision. The billboard lights came on at sunset and stayed on all night. So the yellow domed tents glowed within no matter what the hour and the winds blowing off Blue Mountain into the Lehigh Valley battered against the billboard, keeping the platform in constant motion. It would be, in more than one way, a very long fall. The campers can talk to one another, but they don't much. They say they don't particularly like one another. What kind of communications do you have with the other people up here? Very little. I don't even know if we said hi to each other. I remember visiting from tent to tent and saying, "Well, I just talked to Ron who said this." And Dalton would go, "How's he doing?" I think we talked more today than we did in the first three months for sure. You know, you take three people from totally different backgrounds, completely different interests and you put them together and what do you expect, you know? They were so determined that they weren't gonna let somebody else get their home. There was one mobile home that we were going for. And that was, who knew how long that thing could've lasted. When we started this contest, all three of those guys knew deep down inside that they could stay up there forever if they had to and they were pretty sure the other two guys wouldn't. I figured it's gonna last as long as I stay there. It didn't matter who else was there. How long do you think you'll be here? Oh maybe two years. Maybe this winter, maybe next summer. And I'm willing to spend five years here if need be. I didn't expect him to come down without the house. So however long he needed to. What communication goes on is more in the nature of psychological warfare. I use mental telepathy from time to time to try to get inside these guys head and try to break them down as much as possible. When someone tries to run in place or do jumping jacks, the whole billboard shakes. I'd shake that thing once in a while, just like try to piss these guys off, you know? I think some of the tone was set by Mike because he just knew he was gonna win this. When a visitor comes, Mr. MacKay loudly describes how much he is enjoying the experience. If everybody could have left and I won this thing in a month, wow, a month, $18,000 home, but the price wouldn't be worth it that much, it's just like someone gave it to you then, you know? The harder it is, I think the more I'm gonna enjoy the victory. He had no doubts that he was going to be the last one to come off the billboard. Mister's Young and Kistler complained that Mr. MacKay's CB radio messes up their radio reception. He was in there doing anything he could to psych them out. "Ron will drop out first," he predicts referring to Mr. Kistler, he's lonely. Dalton is my real competition. But Dalton likes to party. When the weather starts getting nice, Dalton may quit. The thought that comes to mind first, if the question is not necessarily what got these guys up there, but what kept them there is social influence. And since I'm a social psychologist, that's not too much of a surprise. There were a lot of people in the local area that had pools going on at the local bars and things. And other people, friends and family, I didn't want to let anybody down. I wanted to win the thing. It was mano a mano kind of thing, you know? These guys just could not let the other guy beat him. There was too much to lose. One of the things I really remember about being up there was claustrophobic. It was awkward. There was a confined space. To be cramped in a little spot and not be able to go anywhere or do anything would've driven me crazy. The tents were hardly a windbreak. It was just, it was awful. You couldn't have been real comfortable. Yeah. And there was this lack of socializing as well. It's not just the conditions, the living conditions up there. You're that far removed from seeing anybody else but these guys on either side of you. One morning I was done brushing my teeth and shaking water out and the toothbrush fell. So it's like, you know, nothing you can do about it. It's laying down there but you can't go pick it up. Can you imagine how deadly boring that must have been to just sit up there all day long? What would you do? What do you do to keep yourself busy? You know, wake up, have something for breakfast, listen to the radio, hang out. So life on the billboard is a test of psychological endurance. Monotony is the killer. Afternoon, Sue would stop by on her way home from work. Talk with her, have something for supper and hang out, watch traffic. Kistler's tent is the most sparsely furnished of the three, among the only non-essential items being a stack of American Rifleman magazines. Tell me about it. I mean how you live? What's your daily life like? Well, I usually get up about 10 in the morning. Sometimes wash up, like I'm on about a four day wash cycle right now, so I wash like every fourth day. You know you caught me on a bad day. Now trying to win a contest by living on a billboard seems a bit off the wall, but with determination, telephones, and today's Thanksgiving dinner, the three seem to be adapting well. I told my wife, I don't know how many Thanksgivings I have to spend away from you, but in the end we'll have a nice Thanksgiving in our new home. Billboard Mike MacKay, Ron Kistler and Dalton Young each got a Cornish hen, stuffing, vegetables, and a bottle of wine from the contest organizers. But this Thanksgiving, there were no hugs or toasts because the trio isn't allowed any visitors except reporters, and they can't even cross the barriers between them. "The nightlife is what I miss," Mr. Young continues, "and the young ladies and freedom and mobility." And just the beyond there without having any relations with their wives or their girlfriends, was a big detriment to them. These three most unusual contestants do agree on one thing. And that is the hardest thing about life at top of billboard is the lack of visitors, especially those of the female persuasion. Yet they're determined to stay here several years if necessary. Craig Stevens, Newswatch 16, Allentown. Did I have some fans, some female fans? I guess I did, you know, but again, it wasn't like we could get intimately acquainted on any level because of that distance. It would be very nice to go home and take a hot bath tonight and you know hold my wife and have a good dinner and all that would go with it. Being held. I think that's the most that I've missed out of this whole thing is not having him around to hold. Mike and Linda were the only ones that were married. They allowed us up twice. You had to be careful with your noises and any kind of movement because it vibrated through the entire billboard. So whatever you were doing on your end, everybody knew you were doing it. So the conjugal visits had to be very quiet. Unforgettable 1470 WSAN our WSAN Love Homes You'll Love to Live With Us Contest and the 81st day and the temperatures fell to five degrees above zero on the billboard last night. Tonight fellas, you got a lot of things to look forward to, freezing rain and/or snow. There weren't a whole lot of people that really even knew about the contest. I mean locals, but it hadn't taken off yet. I'm not sure how radio advertising and that stuff works but you think people in that business should have been able to pick up on it and do something with it. It wasn't that we didn't know what we had and didn't know what to do with it. Oh yeah, we had an idea of what we had. We were told not to do it. The station switched from country to the unforgettable format so it wasn't a good match for that particular format. The genesis was as a country radio station. You could wake them up at two in the morning. "Country Boy Will Survive", Hank Williams Jr., it all comes together, you could do it. But when you're applying the Ames Brothers or the Andrews Sisters, not so much. We also had a general manager, a new general manager, and he hated the promotion. He did not want to promote something that didn't fit the brand. Gordon came in after all the planning of this was done and he kind of wanted to move on to the next stage and Harold wasn't quite ready and we still had this thing to deal with. Harold Fulmer, he looked out over his eyebrows the way he did when he was angry and then he said, "You're the idea man. I want you to get this thing rolling." Okay. WSAN's program director, Gene Werley was like a boy with a pet frog. I went outside pumped. In two more months, he'd go to lengths to explain to reporters that this contest wasn't his idea, but something he inherited. And I'm saying Gordy, I'll have stuff ready. I got a couple of ideas right now, I got this one idea. For now, however, all he wanted to do was watched the pet frog jump. And he turned to me and I believe he took one hand off the wheel and sort of pointed at me using several expletives telling me he didn't want the contest promoted, he wanted it ended. How did I feel about that? I was 22, I did what I was told. So you were gonna buy everybody a home, bring 'em down on Christmas? Correct. Why did that change? Well, it changed because of that lady at The Wall Street Journal. You know, I was kind of a rookie reporter at The Wall Street Journal. I remember Betsy's piece real well and I can still see it sitting on my desk. We usually have a front page story we call the A-Hed, which is for something that's kind of out of the box. Anytime you looked at The Wall Street Journal, you read the important story on the left, you read the two stories in the middle, which told you what was going on in the world, and then you paused to enjoy the A-Hed the great story. It was the best writing in American newspapers on a daily basis ever. You have no idea when you're writing stories, which ones are going to hit a nerve. December 9th, I'm on the air. I did notice the phones were ringing constantly all the lines. I'm not giving anything away. So I'm trying to answer some of the phones and I'm getting people, some of them with broken English or worse, and I have no idea what they're saying, except they're talking about people on a billboard. So by the time we got off the air, some information was gathered that said The Wall Street Journal did a front page article on the billboard. That ignited the fire. But of course that's when the chaos started too. Suddenly, media types were ringing up from Paris and as far East as the Tasman Sea. Here I am some nobody and next thing you know, I'm in newspapers from all over the country, world. Now I'm the little guy in the sense that we talk to Tom to three times a week. Now we have somebody here who is really interested in us and they're from of foreign country. They literally were showing up in our parking lot. It sort of flashed, you know, it was just going along there and nobody knew about it and then all of a sudden, boom, everybody knew about it and we just weren't prepared for that. We were radio guys, not PR guys. I worked overnight. So you'd get a call two o'clock in the morning, whatever, and as soon as you heard the person speak, it might be someone saying, yeah, so I'm calling in regards to your billboard contest and we were wondering if we can speak with some of the participants. And you're like, oh, that's London, that's somebody from BBC. Our phones just light up with everybody wanting to come in and interview these people and do everything. Well that became a huge time suck for us. Or you'd really hear somebody say, "G'day, I'd like to talk to your billboard guy", and you'd be like, oh that's Australia. And everybody wanted access to these people. And then of course, "Hello, is there someone that I can talk to there about the men on the billboard? And you're like, oh, it's France, it's Paris calling. And there was a policy in place, don't give out their phone numbers. And I really broke a big rule. The French newspaper did publish the three numbers. I don't know why they published them. I had no idea they were gonna do that. So all of a sudden we're getting like 100, 150 calls a day from French people and most of them, all they said was we are the French and that was it. YOu didn't get any of those calls from the French right? No, they put my number in wrong. Yeah. And a woman from Allentown was getting all of those calls. Yeah. And then finally the station changed our phone numbers. I can remember the group from Japan came in twice. I believe they were TV. We had some from Germany. Spanish and German and English and Japanese. Everybody was picking up the story. Just about all over the free world. And Canada. The Canadians had the most fun with this ever. I'd call my mom. "Channel whatever was here today and it's gonna be on at this time." And she'd try and do the VCR. She wasn't real good at it. I was just thinking it seems the bigger things happen here, the bigger the camera gets, the local TV looks like a home movie camera compared to that. It's like waking up in the morning, walking out and there's this Japanese or French baby there with a load in its diaper. Because that's kind of what I looked at that I had to deal with that day. Okay I had my own business and my own duties to do, but now I had to change this diaper and talk and say the same thing over and over again, okay. And it really wasn't my diaper to change. One of the coolest things that happened, I thought when I was up there, was I got a call from a radio station in New Zealand. He'd interview me for like half an hour and then for like a half an hour, he was gonna open it up to phone callers from New Zealand. And I said, "Yeah, sure." And he said, "Well, there's a time difference. It'll be like two in the morning." I said, "That's okay, I have nowhere to go." That did, that did talk about the economy and the way things were, especially up there. ♪ When we're living here in Allentown ♪ ♪ And they're closing all the factories down ♪ ♪ Out in Bethlehem they're killing time ♪ ♪ Filling out forms ♪ ♪ Standing in line ♪ In 1982, when the rust belt kicked into high gear and the steel industry took a big dump, we played an Allentown. And I said, "Allentown, Allentown, that's like an American name. It's like Jimmy Town, Bobby Town, you know, Tommy Town, living here in Allentown." It was a very mixed reaction because the good news is that's Billy Joel, he's doing a song. The bad news is the lyrics weren't really what you wanted to hear. When Allentown first came out, a lot of people in Allentown didn't like the song. They were really ticked off about the song. And Billy Joel heard about it, right, so he called and this guy that I knew was on the air at the time and I was like get out of here, it's not Billy Joel. No, no, it really, it's me, it's me. No, no, why would you be calling here? Well, you guys are pissed about Allentown. If you subtract Billy Joel's song from the equation, no one would have gone to write about these guys. Yeah, they collided at the wrong time or the right time, depending on who you are. ♪ And it's getting very hard to stay ♪ ♪ And we're living here in Allentown ♪ My phone rang and the editor of People said, "Would you like to go to Allentown, Pennsylvania? There's three guys sitting up on a billboard." I said, "Sure." I couldn't believe reading the People magazine article. Picked that up and I was like, we're in People magazine, really? Now all of a sudden, you know, you have all this media at your doorstep wanting information, but it doesn't put anything after the equal sign for us. You know, if we were making little widgets again and all of a sudden, you know, France or Japan came in and said, oh, we want to buy this or Japan came in and said, well, we want to buy advertising spots on your radio station for what Japanese people to listen in Japan but our signal doesn't go that far? So now a local radio station promotion now took on this whole nother dimension that we had to manage. Ron Kistler had been perched on a billboard for four months and he still didn't know what to make of all the attention he was getting. Even in icy January, people were making pilgrimages to see him. I come visit every day. I missed one day. Talk about that. Missing one day? Yeah. It snowed, I couldn't get there. The snowstorm was different. I remember thinking the contest would be over. I thought this would kill it. And it didn't. That's the only time there was like no traffic and it was absolutely quiet up there. Loved it. It was the quietest time up there, you know, for that whatever 24 hours or however long, 48 hours to till they dug everything out. It was peaceful, you know? It was just so quiet and so peaceful. Shoveling off this little area up here, beats shoveling the whole driveway, or you know? I cleared that spot off in like 15, 20 minutes, you know? The snow off the tent. Pushed it off to the side and you were done. If every day had been a blizzard up there, it would've worked out nicely, you know? Half an inch, Mike? Seriously, my barber did drive by it not too long ago. Did he really? And he says, "You need a haircut." I says, "By the time I come down I'm gonna need an estimate." You had people rooting for them. You had horns blowing on route 22 in MacArthur Road. People would drive by and they'd be blowing their horns at these guys. Friday and Saturdays were a little more interesting at night. Yeah, there was a lot of partying going on. Yeah, there was partying going on. I remember one time there was a bus trip. I guess they were coming home from the baseball game at like 11 o'clock at night. They were trying to throw six packs up on the billboard for us. Did you catch any six-packs? Some yeah. I think it's a whole lot crazy. But I enjoy it, every minute of it. The contest had its hooks in the public imagination. I mean now things go viral so quickly. Before social media and really even before the internet, some stories just did that and you didn't even really know how. Oh, if they had mobile devices, they're getting more retweets than anybody we've ever seen. If Mike MacKay had a Twitter account, his thumbs would have arthritis in it. There'd be nightly videos going viral. This was like a reality show back then. Kids and people would stop by with their cars and there was accidents, rear ends, collisions. It was a nuisance. I don't know that the township was really thrilled about this after about this after about six weeks, right inside their boundaries. Obviously Rolling Stone would be interested in that whole thing. Everything is pitched. I wrote a proposal, sent it to Rolling Stone blind and got the assignment. I wasn't just in radio, but I was a reader of Rolling Stone magazine. Now how cool is that? We're in Rolling Stone magazine. That's fun. I remember that first day up on the billboard wondering what the hell I was gonna write because everybody had done something. And I went back to my hotel room and I got stoned and I started thinking, man, what am I gonna do with this? And then all of these ideas started flowing. The guy was up there for almost a full week with us and he stayed up all day long. I think he wanted to actually live the experience. He wanted to take me out to somewhere that we would have gone, a place that we would have hung out, just to see what kind of place we'd hang out at. And we had had a drink and I guess you got a phone call on the billboard saying I was there with some other guy. That's wonderful. In four days, Mike and Ron and Dalton will have been on this billboard for six months, six very long months. No one is predicting which one will come down first, but all three agree on one thing, they've been up here much too long to give it all up for one color television set. They say they've earned more, a lot more. See I wasn't interested in the stunt. That didn't interest me. What interested me was that people were being exploited and that the economy was so bad that people couldn't have a decent way of life and they had to resort to idiocies like this. It was hard to say precisely when, but sometime in February, after one of the worst snow falls in Lehigh Valley history, the contest had changed from three guys competing for a mobile home to three guys banded together against the promoters. It's gone on past the station's expectations and I think now it's more three of us pulling together versus the station more than us against each other. Mike MacKay became the spokesman for the group. All I can say is I'm not coming down until I got a house and I'm sure the other two feel the same way. In fact, I'm positive they are. I've seen 'em, I see 'em every day, I talk to 'em. With Young and Kistler behind him, he demanded mobile homes for all. When they have 20 winners in the Boston marathon, when both teams in the world series get world series rings because they tried so hard when every kid in fourth grade who spelled one word correctly is entitled to be the winner of the spelling bee then I'll consider as a promotion man to consider having contests where nobody loses. And then they begin to play rich guy versus poor guy. Here's Mr. Fulmer with his McDonald's and his cars. Is he exploiting these guys to doing? It's like absolutely not. The billboard three disagreed. "What are we talking about?", asks MacKay. "He could throw in two more mobile homes for less than the price of one of his cars. What's it going to look like two years from now when one of us get sick and comes down and says, "I'm having trouble breathing." "Harold Fulmer just doesn't want to swallow his pride and fess up that he made a damn mistake." There they were against all odds against that nasty rich guy who wasn't a really nasty guy at all. It had become such a nasty dispute between the promoters, the radio stations and the guys on the billboard. And you know, that was the economics of the time, right? The guys with the money, the guys who sell you stuff and the people who buy. And they were the buyers stuck with the product. So that's exploitative. They're there for the greater glory of Harold Fulmer and WSAN. I think that might be a possibility if we can get a promoter in here that can, I don't know do what but maybe we can make enough money just so that we can all get a home and come down. There's talk about granola bar commercials and things like that, you know, possibly endorsements or something pretty quick. Other than that, it's still a contest. You know, if no one does it, if that doesn't come through, it's still a contest. I think of it in the context of where Whitehall police might've been at with the whole thing. Again this billboard contest transitioned to public nuisance. MacArthur Road, where the billboard is located, just over the town line from Allentown is the busiest shopping area in the Lehigh Valley and officials want commerce to proceed unimpeded. And all of this is coming to a head at this point. So for them, I think the pressure was mounting to do something. It shouldn't have lasted this long. We didn't think it would have. We want to get it over with quite frankly, because you should see the next promotion we're gonna be running. "If the publicity turns bad," Fulmer said to me, "We could just give all three of them a mobile home, but I don't want to do that and I don't think we're going to have to." It was one morning, there was a guy out talking to Ron and Mike and I was in the tent, I forgot what I was doing, I was on the phone with somebody or whatever and the guy left. Well he came back the very next day and we were talking about our experiences in the military and some of the partying we had done and. Dennis Peters, 31, visited the billboard early in March and asked if Young ever got high. Yeah, I thought at that point, we had some sort of a bond, you know? Yeah, sure, I get high. "Later," he says, Peters returned, explaining that he had just taken a job in the Allentown area and didn't know where to buy grass. He called me a few times and one time asked me if I could get him anything. I said, "Not really." "Finally I said I'd try to get him half an ounce," says Young. "More than anything, I wanted to get the guy off my back." He said, "Well, is there anything you need?" And I said, "Well, I don't know, like a six pack of beer would be cool." He came, he showed up that night. He was down on the ground and there were a couple other guys that were down there and they were hitting this bowl. The guy who was clearly drawing from this pipe, you know, he could see the bowl glowing, you know? And so then he said, "Well, do you have it?" And I said, "Yeah." So I stuck it in a cigarette pack and dropped it down to him. He sent up a 20, he took a cigarette pack and stuck a 20 in and then passed up. I said, "Look man, really just take it." He said, "No, I insist, I insist." And I thought, well you know, 20 bucks, 20 bucks, I'm not gonna turn it down. He called me a couple more times throughout the next couple of weeks. And I said, "Look man, I'm not dealing up here. I got enough from my own head and I'm not into selling any. But if you want to stop up, I'll turn you on and I'll get you higher or whatever." And then two weeks after the day that the transaction went down, somebody started to open my tent flap. At first, I thought it was a member of the press. And I said, "I'll be out in a second. I have to put some shoes on and a jacket." By the time I closed my tent flat, they had opened it back up and said it was the Whitehall police. I had no idea what was going on at that point. Dalton Young, one of the three men who've been living on the billboard for the last 184 days was arrested for dealing marijuana. What? Who deals from on top of a billboard? Everybody gets their pot from 20 feet in the air. Young was taken early this morning from the roadside billboard where he had spent the last 184 days. They said, "Well since you have to climb down this ladder, we won't cuff you until you hit the ground." I'm like, okay, well that's mighty kind of you. I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything. I called him he didn't answer his phone. I got out, he wasn't out on the board. All of a sudden he was gone. On the radio WMMR said that they couldn't get through to him. All I remember is is that one day where we called him and nobody answered. I thought, oh, what's going on? We had information from various people that had called us and through the grapevine that there was something that wasn't right down there. So we had an officer investigate it. Was there that little going on in Allentown, right, that Columbo in plain clothes had to show up and try to buy pot from a guy on a billboard? He's selling marijuana. I don't think anybody told him to do it. So they had like two police cars, I think an unmarked car, they had like four uniformed cops and probably like an undercover cop or two. I get a phone call early in the morning, probably before five o'clock from big muscle man. He says, "You're gonna have a good time telling the boss this one. Dalton got busted for drugs." I says, "What?" Actually as bad as it sounds, I was happy, he's gone. Do you think your odds are any better? I don't know, I've still got to outlast Mike. So how do you feel about it now that your competition's been decreased? I'm not coming down till I get a house. We had a chance to talk to Young later this afternoon at his attorney's office. His attorney, Richard McCool of Allentown, stressed that contest is not over and that the case is what he calls "a textbook case of entrapment". Sure, it's entrapment. It's entrapment because were it not for the action of the police officer himself, Dalton would never have made a sale. The police officer went there for the purpose of making a sale, encouraging the sale, enticing the sale. I felt Young was set up. Dalton was set up. I honestly believe he was set up. I call it entrapment. That is a classic case of entrapment. No, that's absurd. There would have been no crime except for the activity of the police. The police create the crime. You know adults should know what they're doing at all times and they got to watch their P's and Q's, especially, right? So Dalton didn't sell any drugs before that or after that, no one alleges that he did. I wasn't like running around seeking people to sell pot to. There was one sale and that sale was not initiated by him even by the police story. He didn't say, "Hey, I need some money, could you buy some pot from me?" No. If he's not that smart to do such a thing, then breaking the law, we got to make the arrest. I'm probably the only person in history to be arrested selling pot from a billboard. Fast forward it down the pike a little bit well there has to be a hearing. So the two guys on the billboard get subpoenaed. I don't know that anybody expected my lawyer to subpoena those two guys. Harold says, "Well, can the judge come to them?" No. It ranked right up there with the space walk. Judged the event by the amount of coverage it got. The two finalists, Mike MacKay and Ron Kistler, climbed down from the billboard this morning for the first time in 200 days, not because the contest is over, but because they were wanted in court. I was hoping that when I would first put feet on the ground in the beginning, I was hoping it would be to be a winner. And now here I am coming down to court. We gave them each a room. They could shower and shave. Ron Kistler shaved this morning with an army of cameras over his shoulder. After living on a billboard for 200 days, Kistler's trip to the bathroom proved to be a media event the likes of which this area has never seen. And after six months without a shower, Kistler didn't seem to mind the lack of privacy. They brought us down and they took us for showers and stuff and the cameras just followed me in. So I'm gonna shave. Got him out and gave him I believe an astronaut type breakfast with steak and eggs. Well I took a shower, I had a good breakfast and I'm good for another two years. I came down off the ladder, I put little bit of mud on myself. It's the first time I touched dirt for awhile and it felt good. Took them over to the magistrate's office and that was a whole media scene. Mike and I chatted. I think there was a picture in some magazine or newspaper that shows the two of us sitting there. I couldn't believe the smile I had on my face right before the hearing started. Actually I kind of belied what I was really feeling inside. I was kind of anxious. The guy who was sentenced right before me, got I think it was three to five years for selling heroin and I thought, I hope the judge doesn't view pot the same way he views heroin or I'm gonna be looking at some time. It's 1983. And the liberal drug laws of today were not available then. But Whitehall might have its problems pressing its case against Young. The township had recently assessed that Young owed $15 in resident taxes. That meant that they considered a billboard to be his home. The township, however, failed to issue a warrant to search that home. So when the officer raided the billboard home, he might've compromised whatever evidence he found by conducting an illegal search. Officials here at town hall, equally disillusioned with the contest, have contemplated sending the housing inspector to evict the contestants. The billboard has no plumbing or smoke alarms. You can't make this shit up. You know? I mean you couldn't script this for a play. No one is sure what effect his arrest will have on the contest, not even Young. Well, I think it's taken a drastic change, something nobody ever expected. Do you think you should still win if you go back up? Well put it this way, if I go back up, I'm gonna win. I'm not gonna go up and lose. After all he went through, it's not fair to him. What if he's innocent? It's not fair to him. And on the other hand, if they allow him up after a long time of being down, it's not fair to us. There was some talk about me going back to join the contest again afterwards and then it never did come up because of course, by the time my trial came that was August. Didn't find me guilty or not guilty till then. When it was over, Dalton Young was undaunted by it all. Dalton, do you have a sense of almost relief that you got down and you didn't have to quit on your own? Well in a way 'cause now I don't have to kneel to go to the bathroom anymore. That was one of the first things he said. Yeah I can stand up to pee. Great. There was nothing funny about it for me, it was sad. We had what I thought was the goose that laid the golden egg and somebody decided to try and hard boil it rather than take it to the pawn shop and cash in on it. After testifying that they had never observed Dalton Young either using or selling marijuana, the two climbed the ladders to their Spartan home away from home. And so for Mike MacKay and Ron Kistler, it's back on the billboard perch to continue the long endurance contest. For them, the lure of the first prize, an $18,000 mobile home, still represents a dream house and neither of them is about to kill a dream. I think the first thing that I saw was Mike stepping things up a little bit. One of the guys was off the billboard, whether it was just Mike's good luck or what it was, but now he only had one more pin to knock down and Mike was intent on winning. After the bust, township officials sought ways to end the contest consulting local zoning officials, police and building inspectors, looking for a way to close things down. I think that's when things went from how is this thing gonna end to how we gonna end this thing? At this point, it seems the media's preoccupation with this contest is practically unlimited. In fact, if you look at People magazine this week, you'll see a picture of Dalton Young being whisked away by the Whitehall police. The latest chapter in this story will unfold tonight on ABC at 12 o'clock on Phil Donahue's "The Last Word". Phil Donahue. For the better part of a year now, Allentown, Pennsylvania has been receiving international publicity. And Donahue badgered the radio station, came over to me and he said, "We want to do this, we want Mr. Fulmer on this and everything else." And I said, "Howard, you can't go on this show. You just can't go on to this show. He'll eat you up." Then he said, "Should we go on the show at all?" And we really hadn't had a public forum where we could tell our side of the story on the thing. And he says, "Well, you go Mike." Setting up the signal between Donahue in Chicago and the billboard in Whitehall was no small task. Well, they asked if we could take the billboard guys off the billboard and fly 'em out. No, no, it's like why should we make you a hero, Phil, and this whole thing? That's not happening, you know? Well you took 'em off for the courts. Yeah, well that was because it was a court. You're not a court. Phil comes in, he shakes my hand, he says, "Hi, Phil Donahue, nice to meet you here. Let's go." He says, "Now you're a big boy, I'm a big boy." This whole half hour goes by very quickly, there's commercials in there. So don't come crying to me afterwards if you don't have a chance to say something. "You got that." I go, "Yeah, nice to meet you too." You got to be a little nervous about this, Michael. Isn't this getting a little bit old and don't we reach a point where it isn't funny anymore? I'm there, okay, let's go, I'll play off the television too. I says, "Well, there's an integrity of a contest here." You know, these people entered, Mike, how many times did you enter? What 47,000 times there? Yes. And Ron, what are you, two or 3,000 times? 4,004. So I'm starting to talk to the billboard guys and get them engaged with me. Well then I don't think Phil liked that I had that finesse or that nuance to be able to do something like that. Just like another day on the billboard. Cars are going by and you're waving at the cars and his producer is yelling at you in the earphones. Don't wave to those cars, look straight at the camera. His producer came on and yelled at us for waving to the traffic and not paying attention to him. You did not know each other before you went up there, right? Right, we met- - Have you guys developed a relationship? I don't mean that in a funny way, but? We see each other everyday. Why don't you sell this story and make 17 times what the house trailer's worth? Donahue pulled one of his strings and Mike MacKay starts talking and babbling and- - For anybody who wants to buy this story, my number is... But every question he asked was a negative question. Are you sure you don't feel a little guilty about taking advantage of these young men? Do you feel like as though you're being exploited? You must be talking to yourself? How are you doing psychologically? At one time he turned to the billboard guys and says, "Wouldn't you all like to come down?" Well, of course they would all like to come down. Sure I would. I'm looking at my watch and I got to take some initiative here. And I said, we have taken probably the simplest idea ever done and gained international attention with it. The billboard costs us $750 to rent and a couple of phone lines for the three guys. Why don't you give 1,000 bucks to the top ad agencies in the country or in the world and see what type of publicity that they can generate. Then he came back at me and he says, "Well, aren't you exploiting them?" And that point I stood up and I says, "Phil, you know, if you were to have your cameras pan around to the other side of the billboard, they're gonna see two huge tractor trailers there, which my radio station engineers estimate that it cost 20 grand to move all that equipment in there to do this broadcast. Why didn't you be the big hero here and give these guys each a mobile home? I says, who's exploiting who here? Well that went on the editorial floor. For "The Last Word", this is Phil Donahue. Now back to Craig in New York. Mike was such a great showman and knew what he wanted to be in this act. So he was letting the word out that he was finished, he was coming down. Yes, he did. I get a call at about 8:30, nine o'clock at night from the lady that was on the air at the time And she was a, "Gene, I'm getting a call." Mike MacKay says he's coming off the billboard tomorrow. What should I do? I know you said if anybody came down, "we're supposed to record them." I was I think half awake at the time. It was mayhem. Everybody was trying to get there and I just knew that it wasn't gonna happen. Within minutes after that phone call, I get a call form Tom Updike. Tom called and said, "Hey Gene, any interesting things happen tonight?" He was strange opening. And I thought, boy, they already know, the guy went to the newspaper, whatever. They're gonna break it before we do. Well, they can't till tomorrow morning. But as we talked a little bit, I thought, gee, this guy is trying to get me to read between the lines on something. I remember trying to guide Gene. I said, "Tom, you know we got a phone call? Did Mike MacKay call you or whatever?" And he wouldn't answer. "Tom, here's the deal. Mike called, he said he's coming down, the whole thing." "Yeah, when did he say he's coming down Gene?" And it was more of the, yeah, I know all this. It's like, well tomorrow, I don't know exact time, but it's tomorrow, that's the day he's coming down. And as we're going back and forth, it's almost like he had to pound my head to get the point across. So it dawns on me tomorrow is April Fools Day. Mike MacKay's the biggest clown we have up there. That son of a gun. I know where I'm going with this story. I don't believe it's true. I'm either gonna be the one who was right or I'm gonna be totally embarrassed while everybody else is out there. And I went out anyway of course, I wasn't taking any chances. I went to the billboard expecting him to come down all dressed up and excited. We go to the billboard in the morning and you only have one person responding. There's no Mike MacKay responding. He wouldn't come out of his tent. So they finally went up and as they're looking through the tent, somebody supposedly looked through, hollered down, he's not up here. It was continuation of keep looking, keep looking. They found him hiding under his cot with all of his clothing and everything stuffed around him. I think he said, "Gotcha." And we thoroughly believed that was his plan to get the only remaining billboard contestant to quit early, go down, figuring he was already gone. How did it end? Compromise. At the end of the contest, we weren't really doing anything but reading one line off an index card by direction. We weren't really talking about it anymore because nobody wanted to say the wrong thing that would blow up all the negotiations, right? We wanted to bring it to a nice amicable conclusion. So here's the funny part about that. You've got national TV talking about our contest, other radio stations calling us while we're on the air wanting us as disc jockeys to go on their air to talk about our contest and on our own radio station not so much. Enter a third party, a Sacramento promoter, the West coast Whiz kid. With us here in New York are Harold Fullmer, the radio station owner who started the whole contest and Jerry Gaffney, a promoter who is trying to find a fair way to end it now. And good morning to everyone. So on May 4th, Harold Fulmer hauled his 300 pounds up an aluminum ladder to the deck of the billboard. With him, were an aid, attorney and WSAN's Gene Werley. They came bearing a contract. What are they going to get? If both men would come down, each would get a mobile home. Besides that, what they're gonna be getting is two automobiles, one a piece. Yes. They're also gonna be getting a trip to The Bahamas, they're gonna be getting a trip to Las Vegas for a week. And Megan, we know that they need those. Hey, good luck guys, you really stuck in there. It's finally over, yeah. Day 261 and hang around 'cause they're coming down. Next with Werley early in the morning, the WSAN Love Homes Love to Live with You Billboard contest on 1470 WSAN Unforgettable. At about five after nine, they'll take their tents down, they'll lower those down. Then they'll come down on two ladders. Get all dressed up, go down there and it was crowded, there was people everywhere. It was really hard to figure out what was going on. That was like a good crowd when it ended down below there. Well the majority of that's media from what I remember. These are all photographers and over here, most of them are camera man. I know. Who'd a thunk, huh? I was really glad when he finally took that step. One, two, three. It went on for nine months. They sat on this sign for nine damn months. That never happens. You know it just captured people's imagination that three people could take this time out of their life and go for a prize. And the prizes were substantial, an $18,000 mobile home they came down with and a car. Okay, so package that together, that's like 25 grand in '83. That's a lot of money. I wanted a mobile home, manufactured home, and that's what I got, plus extra so I'm happy. I had to come down sooner or later. I didn't know how I was gonna do it. They were the heroes. They got down in their own terms. Once back on mother earth, it was off to go to WSAN where Kistler and MacKay were served with a champagne breakfast, courtesy of contest sponsor, Harold Fulmer, who was more than pleased with the success of his latest promotion. We as any radio station or any media wants to go into a promotion is for recognition. Obviously we did very, very well in that area. Mike MacKay was a winner and celebrated by carrying his wife across the threshold of their new home joking off after he signed the ownership papers, "I hope I'm not entering another content." From now on, this billboard will look like any other one you might pass along the highway, but what happened on this particular billboard is just what the sign says, unforgettable. So Mike, who was really the winner in this whole thing? That's a good question. Who's the winner, you know? Uh... Well certainly we brought attention to our radio station, so they won. The one thing I think of all the time is "The War of the Worlds" fiasco. Okay that was the single biggest event in radio broadcasting. I would have to think that the billboard contest is in the top 10, for sure. In the attention that it garnered, I would put it in the top 10 of all time radio bits. Possibly the second biggest thing. It has to be up there. And it has to be the most poorly executed on a local level. It was the worst and best radio promotion of all time. It was a great idea. It was the beautiful failure or a magnificent success or a clustered wonderful thing. People say to me all the time, did this give you a lot more business because you did this promotion? And I tell them sort of this way. It brought attention to the industry. I don't think we got all that much more business out of it. It's sort of like peeing your pants if you're wearing a dark blue suit. Nobody really notices, but it gives you that nice warm feeling. Well, if I'm acquitted, I'm supposed to get a color TV, 19 inch color TV, a years free rent in an apartment somewhere, a one bedroom apartment and three months worth of McDonald's food. I was found guilty of possession. I was found guilty of delivery and I was found guilty of paraphernalia, possession of paraphernalia. I got six months probation and $100 fine. Of course I do have a felony. Well these things happen, you know I mean you live, you learn. - That's the way I look at it. - What did you learn? Learned to be more careful, 30 years later, tell us about your life. You know, I'm, it's just like when I was up in that billboard, you know, I was single, I was lonely. I was kind of cut off from people and detached and it's kind of where I am now, you know. But there's people in my life I care about and they care about me and I think that's what's really important, you know? I think that's what it's all about, you know? It's not so much what we have but you know who we have I think more than anything, and that's really important. The contest was probably the most important thing that ever happened to him in his life. You've had so much publicity through this whole thing. What are you gonna do now without cameras and TV people and newspaper people? It's just gonna be great. When the Klieg lights went off, when the microphones were turned off and everybody went away, all Mike had was a car and a mobile home. Mike wanted more. Mike was looking for stardom. Mike was looking to be a personality who would live the billboard story for the rest of his life and everybody would tell Mike MacKay's story. There would be books, there would be movies, there would be talk show appearances and none of that happened. You know, he wanted that high that he had up there and it wasn't there and it affected him. He just never was able to get right back into the swing of things. I'm very happy I don't have to spend any more time on this billboard. His spirit wasn't the same after that. We're going to relax and try to get back on to a regular normal life. And in the end, the way that it affected Michael, it ended up effecting our marriage, which ultimately had a lot to do with our breakup. So it wasn't, to me, it wasn't worth it. And we just had this bond that this is something that we did that nobody else had done. And for him to go out at such a young age too, I think he was 53 or four, I mean, yeah, I'm really sad about it. I think that this was for him a means to an end. It's great to be down, it's just great. And that's over so now I'm gonna live my life. Whereas with Mike MacKay I think it was an end. And with Dalton, well I'm not sure. I don't think Dalton's sure. The contest was coming to an end and I knew we were gonna come down. I tried to get it out into media, get out that I was looking for a job, a truck driving job and then I got the job through Mr. Fulmer. Harold told him personally, he says, "You need a job, you come to me and we'll get you a job." He was a great painter. He painted all of our apartments when they were vacant. He just liked working by himself. I mean he was that type of a person. Yeah, I did that for 10 years, painting apartments and maintenance. Actually he laid me off on New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve. What became of the home that you got? We're here. We lived in here for 20 years. We traded in for this house and... Got married, had a daughter. Yeah all that good stuff. Ron is just Ron. It's like good I'm down home now and I can go home and get married and then have a baby and happy. Ron Kistler, he gets the girl, he gets the house, he gets the job, he wins. That's not a bad ending to a rust belt fairy tale, is it? I haven't seen him since that day that he got the mobile home. They have not been in touch at all. I didn't know that. You know, I mean, I don't know how much he's changed. I mean everybody's changed, but 30 years ago, I remember him as a 25 year old guy. And so I would be interested to see him as a 56 year old man or whatever. So I can't wait. They're gonna see each other later today. Seriously? Oh man, I'd love to be there for something like that, to see them and hear what they think now. Sometimes truth is better than fiction. I think that's why it's awesome because you can really find humor and comedy and pathos in real stories if we pay attention to them. These three guys, as sad as it made me feel to see them going through what they were going through, it really showed some kind of great spirit about people trying to get through tough times, maybe what I would call the best aspect of who we are as Americans and then the characters that revolve around it. You can't make this stuff up, you really can't. As stunts go, it was just that, it was a stunt. But he was a stunt that represented the time. We always have these kind of benchmarks, these touchstones and I think for the economic crisis of that time, the billboard contest is one of those touchstones. I had no idea really, that that story had created such a sensation afterwards. To look back and see all that paparazzi outside the billboard later. And you started at all? Yeah well, no, they started at all. My friends, we did it. We weren't just marking time, we made a difference. All in all, not bad, not bad at all. Eh. What would you make a movie about? There's three guys sitting in billboard. How long could I have stayed on the billboard? How long I would last on the billboard? Wow. I've often thought about that. I don't know I ever would've gone up on the billboard, to be honest with you. I would have never gone up on the billboard. Oh my gosh, I would not have, I would not have. No, I need a toilet with a heated seat. No, that is not for me. Oh, I'd have been up and down in one day. I would have been off of there period. I would have probably stayed there about 24 hours. Then I would have gone somewhere for a chicken cheesesteak and taken a shower and went home. One or two nights. Maybe if there was a cat up there that I had to rescue, I would've went up. That's about the only way I would've went up on a billboard. So to me, 260 some days is incredible. I don't think I'd go up now. I got a job, I got a house. Looking back, if you could do it all over again, would you? Oh, absolutely, yeah I would. I mean, I probably wouldn't work out a deal with an undercover cop.
