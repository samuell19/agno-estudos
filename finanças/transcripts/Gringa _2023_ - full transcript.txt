You wanted this. But only in theory. Like sex. Right. It's overrated. Come on, get in there. Play for the tie. Go. Let's go, Blue, let's go! I'd already given God a few chances. Like when I asked him for my period to start. And then when I prayed for him to make him stop. This was his last shot at redemption. Nice pass. Hey, go. Go! -No. No! -Steady, Lem. Get back!

Extra practice Tuesday and Thursday. Courtesy of Comrade Marge. This isn't Survivor. We can't just vote her off the team. She shouldn't even be on the team. She was going to jump off a roof. Why is it up to us to make her life better anyway? I mean, she lives in a frickin' car. She lives with her mom. Oh, have you seen her mom? She's gorgeous. She must take after her dad. You've got to drive through the drive-through, Marge. Oh, is that what you learned at Hamburger High? It's my major. Major weirdo. Says the major victim. Ouch. Sticks and stones, bitch. Do you want to die? Too late, I'm already dead. -Excessive, Lem, even for you. -Well... Says the man wearing the purple eyeshadow. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, my God. Wow. You're the daughter? And you're in the market for a well-appointed, comfortably priced, tracked home, I assume. Hey. Where are you going? My trainer charges if I miss a session. Hey. Hey! My mom's card. You still might want to buy the house, right? I know how to reach her. What kind of sadist names her kid Marge? My mom. That's who. Mini Marge Bickford. Realtor of the year, five years ago. Shit, did I forget to buy milk? Mm-hmm. It's okay. I'm off dairy. Professional courtesy. Don't say that. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. I'm fat. The person you see in your head is not who you are. The person I see, is who you are. You're trying to sell me. Everything's a negotiation. Mm, always be closing, Mom. That guy gonna make an offer? He couldn't even make the deposit. Ew. That's so gross. No utilities, honey. Don't worry. We'll get there, I promise. Where is there? Only seen it from a distance. But it looked just like you. When you're happy. -Today's your day. -Go take it. Puker! Oh. Hello, bobby. It really doesn't stress me out that my mom has sex with clients. In fact, the abnormality of it sort of appeals to me. It's not sex in the abstract, like a lot of parents talk about. It's sex in the real. That mom can trust me enough to know is kind of cool. Metaphors be with you. Hey, Margie. -How's soccer? -It's great. Really? Hmm. Big school, small world. Yeah, well, club is really hard. Well, varsity would love to have you. And club is better. It's the next step. And because your father played club. You know, it's not his fault that he was 20 years ahead of the game. It's not the part that I'm blaming him for, Mr. Farnsworth. Did I tell you I have an exclusive on that whole development? That's how we get to stay there for free. No. We're squatters. We're homeless. We are a statistic. No, we're saving money, so we can buy our own place. We're being frugal. And by that time, I will be moving out. Oh, you discovered my plan. It's fine. I'll just move in with Dad. -In prison? -He's not in prison. -He should be. -I'm allowed to miss him, Mom. Oh, please. You were two when he dumped us. He hurts people, Margie. He's a professional hurter. And a professional soccer player. For, like, an hour. Which is half the amount of time of the best part of our marriage. That is so gross. I thought it was destiny, which used to pass for romance. I want to know what it's like to fall in love for real someday. Well, maybe you shouldn't try so hard. Hey. I can't help it if I meet a lot of men. Oh, well, this is the part where she tells us the heartbreak in being beautiful. You know, sometimes I get lonely, Margie. Lonely or horny? What about hornly? Hornly. That's what I am. Get out. Hey. You're my one in a million, kid. Don't let 'em beat you up. -Mm-hmm. Love you. -What? No worries. A 60-day escrow is perfect. All right, let's do it. Let's put it in an offer. Fabulous. Absolutely. The first of many. Thank you. All right. Thanks, Marge. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, kid. Your mom's a star. She just sold her-- And if you hold Marge in your heart, please do the same for her daughter, who she loved more than anything else. This is what happens in California. Frank, please. If it wasn't for California, she never would have met-- Let's just say we wouldn't be here now. I wouldn't be here, either. Tomorrow, we're leaving for Scottsdale. Can I at least say goodbye to my friends? Just be ready first thing in the morning. I'm sorry. Your grandfather always wants to beat traffic. Arizona's not that bad. It's an air-conditioned nightmare. I hardly even talk to my grandparents. You know, they only ever called to yell at my mom about marrying my dad. -I should go live with him. -In Mexico? My dad is in Mexico? I'm guessing. My dad is in Mexico, isn't he? I'm not sure. How long have you known that my dad is in Mexico? You-- you-- I can't-- This is between you and your grandparents, Margie, you know? No! You want me to come? No. Just wait here. No more chances. Mexico. Sh-- shut up. ♪ Just ways to behavin' ♪ ♪ And I've shown you the kind of man that I could be ♪ ♪ Like bringin' the sunlight ♪ ♪ Out of a dark night ♪ ♪ Like a perfect wave that's waitin' there for me ♪ -Hey, buddy. -Can I swim? Think not. You were doing good. You don't even have a passport? You don't need a passport if you're leaving. You can't just go and do this. Marge, it's insane. If I don't find my dad, I'm going to be an orphan. Who's the drama queen here? Please. You have family in-- in Arizona. -Have you met them? -No. They wouldn't like you. Nobody does. Come here. Puker, come on. What do you want me to tell everyone when the federales find your body? Um, that it was all their fault. This is serious, Marge. Right? Like, life-changing serious. I know. That's why I'm doing it. Is it okay to tell you that I'm really gonna miss you? Sure. Can I give you something to remember me by? Okay. How about if I give you my dog? -I knew there'd be a catch. -Nope. No, there isn't. But, you know, I googled it, and, uh, you can't take a dog into Mexico without vaccinations. And that can take at least a week. -So, wait. -No. I'd whimp out and I'd end up in Scottsdale. Goodbye, my little... There you go. Bye, Pukes. Gonna miss you. Bye, Puker. You still call him that? Siri. Directions to Lo de Marcos. Getting directions for low daycare prices. No. S-- directions to Lo de Marcos. To-- -What? -It's very far. -Gracias. -You're welcome. Mexico is... nice. Pretty. Green. And there's a lot of food. Really good food. Go, go, go, go, go! Hey, Blue! What are ya doing? -What're you saying? -Follow, follow, follow. Get on her! Go! It's like a bunch of kids chasing a ball. Guys, I am tired of looking in this direction. No, no, no! Fuck! Oh, shit! Oh, come on. Darn it! This might be one of the stupider things I've done. All right, all right, all right. Yeah, yeah. Listen. We are championship material. We're this close. We still have four more games left in the playoff. Okay? Yoo-hoo. Okay? Who's buying the cervezastonight? Aw, see? Oh, you got that one! All right. Yo? Again? Okay. I got the cooler. Darn it! I knew if I waited here long enough, you would show up. Did Elsa send you? No-- uh, I don't speak the language. My girlfriend. No, I don't know her. I-- I know him. Hey. Where'd you get that? I inherited it. I got one just like it. It's from my mom. Marge Bickford? Marge is your mom? Uh, she was, she... she-- she's gone now. Marge died? How? The hard way. Well, when? Uh, recently. Wait... who are you? I'm your daughter. You're my daughter? -Yeah, I'm-- I'm Margie. -Holy shit! Are you drunk? Not as much as I was a minute ago. That's all you can say? -I don't know, give me a minute. -You've had 14 years. Wait. You got an ID? Holy shit. Oh, boy. I carried this in my pocket for over a month. -You were scared? -No, I was terrified. I loved your mom so much. Right up until she kicked me out. So, why didn't you fight for us? You know, like, try and make it work? Because I was in handcuffs and, um, I just wrecked the family Porsche. Where is she? Oh, man, you're gonna love her. She is so-- She's so sweet and kind, smart. Like-- I don't know. What's wrong? You okay? Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine. I'm-- I'm nervous to meet her is all. Yeah, she makes me a little nervous, too. But-- so, I'm going to have a cerveza. You? Isn't it a little early? Um, well... we're on London time here, so... -Hey, there she is! -We're not open yet. Um, can't beat the service here. Don't worry. I'm gonna need some ID -for your new drinking buddy. -What? I don't know what's your plan, muchachita, but this guy comes with a warning label. -Just so you know. Okay? -Oh! No, no, no! Elsa! Sorry. Hold on a sec. -Elsa! Elsa. Please-- -What? What? What? Can-- Elsa, can-- can I-- I'm sorry. Can I introduce you? Please? Just one second and then you can go back to work, all right? Just let me introduce you. Please. Come on. Elsa... this is my daughter. Margie. Margie? I'm sorry. Hi. -I'm Elsa. -Mucho gusto. Mucho gusto. -Margie's visiting. -For how long? -I dunno. -Forever. -Well-- -No, I-- I wanna live with you. -What? -If you have space. Oh, he has plenty of room. -Yeah, but it-- it leaks. -Yeah, only in the rainy season. Well, yeah. You know, the hard part is gonna be putting up with him. -Oh, I'll give it a try. -Good. Because Los de Marcos needs more strong women. Uh, look, I'm-- I-- I-- I'm a heavy drinker. Don't say that-- -I do. -Stop. -No, it's bad. -I just-- -No, I drink a lot. -You drink-- Don't say that-- -No, it's-- -Well, okay. Look, will you let me raise my daughter, please? -Did he really just say that? -He did. He did. Your blood is in her heart, Jackson. Oh, my God. Drama is such a big part of the culture down here. See? Look, okay. Just, um, we'll try... a month. But... What? It is his house, so he makes the rules. He has rules? I surf when there's a swell, I sleep when there isn't, so don't set an alarm. I'll assume that you know everything you have to know -about Kotex and condoms. -Ew. As far as boys are concerned, don't bring them home if they're kooks or creeps. -Cool? -Mm-hmm. Just humor him. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Welcome to Lo de Marcos. This is so exciting. I get 10% of any deals made on the golf course, Frank. Yes, it's Frank Nelson. Frank. It's, uh, Jackson. I told you never to contact me. -That hasn't changed. -I'm sorry for your loss, Frank. And the last thing I want is your sympathy. Um... Margie is with me. Well, seeing as how she walked out on us when her mom died, tells me you two will get along just fine. Look, I, um... Margie's safe and I just wanted you to know that. -Okay? -I'll tell Betty. Oh. Hey, what's the password? Broken. -No, that's not it. -No. No, as in it's busted. There's no internet. How do you not have internet? I dunno. 'Cause I don't. Well, what about, like, Snapchat? Well, who am I gonna Snapchat at? Um, Elsa. She snaps at me without it. I get all the information I need just looking out my window. Nothing works. Look, my priorities are to keep this town running, surf in second, I'm third. Where do I fit in? Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that one out. But... I think I'm gonna love the challenge. Are you going surfing? You will get to a point where you won't have to ask that. Can you teach me? You know, you can't really teach someone how to surf. It's like walking. No one taught you how to walk, did they? Well, you and Mom did. No, we just picked you up when you fell down. Walking part you did on your own. Help yourself. Oh! Oh! Had enough? I'm just getting started. All right. Waves come in sets. Here, usually three or four at a time. Then there's a lull. That's when you paddle out. Now, you sit off to the side from where the wave starts to break. The part that curls, okay? Float on your board, on the shoulder, that's that rolling hump coming out the back. And rest, okay? Chill. And watch. Always watch. Watch for waves, watch for sharks, watch the horizon. Watch your ass. Cool? Nobody surfs the first day, Margie. Takes a lifetime. Nobody surfs the first day, Margie. No. Takes a lifetime. You'll get it. "La Margies," is that me? Uh, that's the town crier. Telling everyone the latest chisme. That's you. -What's chisme? -Gossip. Great. What are they saying? He's saying... that you came here to save me. Maybe you got that one backwards. Maybe. Hey, there's practice this afternoon. -You coming? -Yeah. All right. Well, see you there. Okay? Hey. Nothing hungrier than surf hungry, huh? I haven't been able to eat much since Mom died. Try drinking. I wonder how many karma points you lose for using your dead mom as an excuse to binge. I promised myself I would only do it when I felt really bad. Which wasn't great, because I felt bad a lot. -Hi. -Hi. Are you sick? Seasick. I went surfing. How'd that go? Still waiting for it to change my life. Wow, I see you did the dishes. Yeah, I'm-- I'm staying here, so... And you fixed that. -It's just a bulb. -Well, don't tell him. You know, Marge, I... I used to get sick. From surfing? No, no, from... from eating. You know, Mexico is the comfort food capital of the world, so... you know, who doesn't wanna be comfortable? I'm comfortable. Elsa, I am fine. Are you? Okay. Good. Well, tell your dad I-- I stopped by, okay? I will. Take care of yourself. Hey. Control it. Go. That's it. Wow. You have a big kick. What, you never googled me? I was afraid to. college ride. Signed with Portsmouth, 300K a year. First season, started every game. Met your mom, got married, had you. Second season, learned how to drink. Uh, wrecked two cars, got arrested, ruined my life. Went surfing. You? Mm. Fat, slow, unpopular. Only ever played when we were way ahead, or way behind. Quit. 'Cause I hated it. Went to Mexico. You left out the part about your mom dying. These ladies are-- are really good. Yeah. I mean, two years ago, they couldn't kick their boyfriends out of bed. But they-- oh, I'm sorry. That wasn't very dadlike, was it? How well did you know Mom? You should've stuck around, you would've liked us. Well, I don't think you would've been too crazy about the kind of dad I was back then. What kind is that? This kind. Hey. Go. -No, no, no, no. -Yeah. Come on. Can't just sit there. Come on. Go. There you go, kid. Get in there, kid! I wonder if drinking too much feels as bad as eating too much. I wonder if it runs in the family, like big kicks. And quitting. Sorry, uh, I don't speak Spanish. I speak English. Like Harry Potter. Hey, I saw you at, um, Tal Ivan. -What? -Uh, the tacos. When? You no remember Chilo? Not really. I, um-- I teach you how to surf. My dad says that no one can teach you how to surf. He never meet Chilo. Come on, I teach you. -What? Now? -Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Uh. Oh! Okay. Come on!

Long time ago. -She just got here. -I-- What did he say? Uh, to be a gentleman. Huh. -Jackson is your papa? -Yeah. You're lucky. Lo de Marcos loves him very much. He-- he brings us pride. Him? So, how many boys have kissed you? That's-- I'm not telling you that. Okay. So, how many Mexican boys have you kissed? It's easy. None. Well, now it's one. All right, let's bring it in. Azus.

García, Placencia, Veneda, Rodríguez, Morales, Guerra, Martínez, Avalos, González, Bickford. No, no, no, no, no. No. Mi, mija. Margie. Okay? All right. -D-- Dad, no, please, no. -No, Anna's kid is sick. No, I will not do it. Please, please don't make me. You need a jersey. Here, wear mine. Mi equipo, yo jofe-- yo jefe? What is it? What do I say? Just talk to her. Hey, you know what, tell her that she is lucky that-- that she's a good goalie. They don't want me here. I'm an expert at this part. Oh, Nayeli will get over it. Eventually. -She's so pissed. -This is how it was back home. -I'm not going to do it. -You have to. -No! -Yeah. My house, my rules, remember? -This is so unfair. -No, you know what? Eating termites off a stick to stay alive, tha-- that's unfair. This is Mexican football. You know, and you're right with the drama being a big deal down here, so if you humiliate me, I'm gonna hate you for the rest of my life. Okay. That's what dads are for. Oh, two days and you're an expert? Does this make me look fat? Proud. Go. Oh, my God. Hola. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Bickford, go! That's good, that's good, stay, stay, stay. There you go, there you go. Open up, open up. Keep with her. Go, go! That's it, that's it, that's it! That's a foul! Hey, how do you say foul? -Faul. -Faul. Faul! No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes! Way to go, Nayeli! Bien! Yes! -Hey! Bien. -Nayeli! Ah, she is hard to like, but I'm glad she's on our team. There you go, there you go, there you are. Right, right, go, go! Perfect, perfect. Yes! Yes! Goal! Yes, baby! Yes! Yes! Bien! Gracias, amiga. -Not gringa? -También. Gringa y amiga. I got it, I got it, I got it. Ladies and gentlemen! We are... one and one! Ooh. Jesus. You have to start treating yourself better. You first. Don't bullshit me, Margie. You make yourself sick, too. Did Elsa tell you that? -She said it was a possibility. -Yeah, well, I did. But now I don't. You still drink. Yeah, well, how would I know? Because you fall down and then you throw up, -that's a clue. -No, no, no. About your bulimia, smartass. I did it to get rid of the parts me that I didn't like. And then when it was over, it was the only parts that were left. That sounds like the lie I tell myself about drinking. There are more parts of me that I like now. What, now that Chilo was being nice to you? No. Maybe because you are. I mean, I jumped into the middle of your life and you didn't make me feel bad about it. Well... you're my daughter. So, when are we gonna start acting like we care about each other? We care about each other. Show me. Stop drinking. Okay. Promise me you'll stop drinking. The only promise I was able to keep was the one about not making any more promises. I'll try. Okay? Here. The sun will give us enough electricity? Guaranteed. And yet you still don't believe in miracles. I do not. Patrick, I believe in science. You should give it a try. Ah, Jesus on a fucking bike, it works. Jackson. What? What's wrong with riding a bike? What do you mean, "What's wrong?" I mean, Jesus doesn't ride a... a fucking bike. He rides a-- a good bike. A nice bike. What? You need to work on your tolerance, padre. There you go. What is the good people from Lo de Marcos owe you? -Uh, same as you always. Nada. -Come on, please. -You have a daughter now. -All right. 50 pesos. Okay. 100. Don't spoil me, Patrick. You know I don't handle it very well. Hey. I'll pray for you. Eh, pray for them. I'm good. Yes! Yeah! El Bichos are two and one! Move, move, move, move! Who's marking? That was a tough loss, ladies. But, hey, we're still in contention for the league final. And maybe even the friendship cup. All right? Hey, hey, hey. Uh, only if it's for good luck. There's no such thing as luck. What about my lucky shirt? Maybe Chilo will buy you this. Oh, my God. This town is too small. There are no secrets at the plaza. Only chisme. Chisme, chisme. Is Chilo a good guy? He goes to church and he takes care of his mom. That matters. -Is my dad? -No, he doesn't go to church. Yeah, but, I mean, is he a good guy? He is to me. You've been good for him, Marge. -He's been good for me. -Is that why he quit drinking? Well, I hope that one's for him. Mm-hmm. You know what? I'm gonna miss you. Yes! A month ago, I was a drunk soccer coach. Hanging out in Mexico without a peso to my name. Today, I'm a single dad. Hanging out in Mexico without a peso to my name. -How does it feel? -So different. You gonna be okay? Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna miss you like crazy, but now that I have a real dad, it'll be easier. Hmm. I'm a real dad now, huh? Sometimes too real. I'll take that as a compliment. Hey, last night. Let's, uh-- let's take a walk on the beach. See me a full moon. I'll show you where I used to bang my head against it. Oh. Jeez. Dad, I'm sorry. It's my last night, so I told Chilo we would-- Oh. Okay. Look. Be careful on your last night. Especially if there's a full moon. Wha-- we're going surfing. -Yeah. -Yeah. Well, you know, you've been doing a lot of that lately. I just... I just hope he's wearing a leash, -is all I'm-- -Dad. Sorry. Just doing my job, kiddo. I won't be late. Not that it's any of your business. Okay. Have fun. Sorry for being late and stupid. Well, you come by it honestly. -Good surf? -Yeah. Made some fun ones. Yeah, naked surfing under a full moon... ...is a tradition down here. And Chilo is a traditionalist. Uh, when is-- when is the bus? I want you to keep it, Dad. Went by fast, though, didn't it? It was the best month of my life. You know, they're probably gonna put me in boarding school. "Sorry, kid, your mom died, but we have tea times." I love you, Margie. Where's the bus? Yeah. How-- Aw, you know what? The bus was yesterday. Yesterday? Yeah, see, it's, like, martesis Tuesday, miércoles is Wednesday. I always get the two mixed up. God. I wonder how the surf is. -So, I'm not leaving? -Not today. But... no more naked surfing. What if there's a full moon out? Now, don't. Don't even-- Wait! Wait, wait, wait-- Wait! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's this? Well, this is quite an honor. Yeah. Is Azu getting married? Hmm. Not yet. She's only 15. -She's 15? -Mm-hmm. I'm older than Azu? Whoa. Wow. She's so pretty. Azucena is inviting you to her quinceañera. Her what? It's a celebration, as Azucena is crowned queen of her life, takes command of her body and walks into womanhood. -Is that a translation? -Word for word. You know, I think that Azu walked into womanhood a few miles back. Well, girls grow up fast in Mexico. You know, my older sister wore this dress to her quince años. And I wore it to mine. What about your little sister? Well, she wanted to get married in it, but it didn't fit. Ah, look who's here. Quinceañera rule number one. Never look more beautiful than the queen. We broke that rule, big time. Wow. And you are the queen of my life. How can you know so soon? Because I do. Hey. Hey. Are-- are you gonna keep your hair like that? Yes. All right. With your permission, señor. Stop with the bowing. Dance. That's a miracle. What, that I haven't killed him yet? -Vamos. -No. -Vamos, vamos. -Here. ♪ Ram-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pam ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Ram-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pam ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Feel the beat pound, pound... ♪ Hey, keep dancing.

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco. Your turn! What-- what's up? What's up? No. Should we tell her? It's just that... Chilo sleeps with all the gringas. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Dad. Dad! You were right. Chilo isn't a good guy. Wha-- what about Chilo? Huh? I'm sorry. Margie, look, I've been drinking a long time. I mean, you don't learn how to surf in one day. C'mon, Margie, it's a process. We had a promise! And you broke it. You know, Mom was right about you. I shouldn't have come. My dad started drinking again. Where is she? Are you still drunk? You hurt my daughter. And you didn't? So, are all men assholes? Mi abuela will think so. I can't say, though. I've never had a boyfriend. -You're a virgin? -Of course I am. -Come on! -I am. Oh, but if someone is special, yes. If I'm getting married one day, of course. But until then, local guys can do it with the gringas, I don't care. I'm sorry. No, I deserve it. I was stupid. Oye. Weak. Not stupid. A little bit stupid. A little bit, yes. -Hey. -I have nothing to say to you. No. It's Margie. She ran away. She must be trying to get back across the border. I don't know what to do. I don't know. Get in. You're gonna need this. Let's go find her. Be brief, don't tell them too much, and they will let you pass. Okay? Thank you for being so kind to me. Bye. Oh, and, Marge. Smile. Country of birth? -America. -Uh, North, South, Central? Um, North. -Canada? -Uh, no. The United States. Okay. Passport. Oh, I don't have one. Uh, you need one. I'm sorry. Well, when I came to Mexico, um, I didn't need one. And I'm American. Right. Well, they don't check, we do. Do you have other documents? Well, you're undocumented, amiga. -Um... -Next. -Azu. -What are you doing here? -They wouldn't let me in. -But why? You're an American. An undocumented one, apparently. Welcome to my world. Follow me. Hey. We are fine. But it's not cheap. -It's 1,000. -Pesos? Dollars. Okay. Okay. This is the longest of long shots, man. And that's a miracle. We're looking for your daughter and you're sober. -Yeah, barely. -Barely a miracle? Barely sober. You need to be thankful for the smallest gift. Trust me. And him. Man, you make atheism hard. Dude, that's what I do for a living. Uh, the ring. Oh. Okay. I haven't lived long enough to do a lot of stupid shit, if you don't count tracking down my loser dad in Mexico. But following a psycho into the desert... ...gotta top my list. Oh, it's lunchtime. No! -Help! -Hey! Now come on! -Wait! Wait! -No, no, no, no, don't! Oh, come on. Are you good? -Yeah? -Yeah. Okay. There's the highway. We're close. -Morning, gentlemen. -Good morning, sir. Passports, please. And, uh... where are you guys from? San Diego, California. Bakersfield, California. What? -What? -You're from Bakersfield? Yes. I'm an anchor baby. My parents got deported when I was a kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get the whole thing. But you never told me you're from Bakersfield. -Yes, I did. -No. If you told me that you were from Bakersfield, I would have said, "Yeah, he's from Bakersfield." Gentlemen. Oh, thank you, sir. -We had breakfast this time... -We've never had breakfast. -...and then we talked-- -Guys! -Oh, I'm sorry. -Let's keep it going. Dr. Foster, please come to the ER. Dr. Foster to the ER. Bueno.Azucena? -Sí, sí. -Hey! -Marge Bickford? -Yeah. Your bloodwork is normal, but you're very dehydrated. What happened? Football injury. Rough game. Let's take care of your eye. You sure you don't want to stay? Totally and completely sure. But you're here. It could be so hard to get back in. You know who thinks everyone wants to live in America? Americans. Now, it's fine to be the neighbor. And I'll keep an eye on you while you're keeping an eye on your dad. -I've given up on him. -Don't. He hasn't given up on you. Yeah, well, it sure feels like he has. What is he doing here? I called. Azu, you should have asked me. He was amazingly not there for me when I needed him. He's new at being your dad. Be kind. I'm gonna need you, Dad. I'm here. Come on. Let's go home. Jackson. Los Bichos are going to the friendship cup in Tijuana. Let me see that. We've been selected as Nayarit state team. What's it say? -Yeah, I know. In English. -We're going to Tijuana. -That's it. -Okay, cool. Let's go tell them. !Bichos, Bichos! Gracias, Padre. I told you. Come on, guys. Look sharp. Is that Lem? Is that Large Marge? No, it can't be. Her ass isn't big enough. Sure looks like her, but-- but she looks good. I thought these guys were from Mexico. They're supposed to be. Lem's dad lives in Mexico. Jackson Bickford was the best soccer player I've ever seen. All instinct, no restraint. Looks like he's El Bicho's coach. Y'all need to level up today, girls. Go. Get out there. Go, warm up. Let's go. Come on. You already won. Have fun. Move it over! She's open, pass! Yeah! Attagirl, that was goal! I'm back. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! Yes! -All right. -Good job, ladies! Let's go back. Come on. Hurry up! Let's go! Come on. Get on her! Let's go, ladies. What are you doing? What are you doing? Fuck! -Feels good. Huh? -Yeah. Rápido. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go! Hey! Hey! Unbelievable! -Are you okay? -Yeah, don't worry. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Come on, guys! Come on, kid, come on! Gringa, Gringa! !Bichos, Bichos! -Hey. -Hey. So, you beat your old team? Yeah. Well, how does that make you feel? This feels bigger. Good answer. We are here... because of God's grace, and the promise that Marge Bickford will be remembered well. Humility... and forgiveness are the gifts we leave to our children. Rest in peace. Jackson. "Marge and I came here on our honeymoon. Back when we were so in love. When life looked easy. And everything... was still out in front of us. It's the only place that I've ever felt whole. Which is..." Sorry. It's hard. "...which is why..." Come here. "Which is why... I came back here. I need to thank Marge for that. And her daughter for all the love I'm feeling right now." Mom would have loved you're with me here right now. She never stopped trying to make my life better. And all of a sudden... it is. Um... I love you. I know. -Thank you. -There you go, baby. -Mm. Delicious. -Oh, forgot the knife. It's your daughter, again. Hey, kid. -Hi, Dad. -Say "hi." -Oh, hi, Elsa. -Hi. -How you doing? -Oh, uh, yeah, I'm okay. -I just really miss you. -Good. You're supposed to. But I'm here. -Here. -Oh, man, I'm jealous. -Thanks for getting Internet. -Oh, no worries. I actually kind of like the machine. -Huh. -Hey. You're gonna do great up there. When are you gonna come up? -Thanksgiving. -Wha-- Thanksgiving? That's, like, a month away. Remember, months go fast. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Hey, um, you're that hotshot futbolista on that full ride. Uh, maybe. I'm the hotshot Mexicano on that full ride, too. -Um, mucho gusto. -Mucho gusto. -Fernando. -Marge. You played for Los Bichos. Yeah, I did. Wow. They're legendary.
