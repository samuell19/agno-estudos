LEGACY PICTURES AND INDONESIAN AIR FORCE PRESENT INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS Sigit, I'm out of paint! Hurry! Commander Tjip bought us time! Adji, check on Har! Damn it. Why didn't you say something? Just got off! Hurry, Put! They're shaking hands! -No time! -There is. ADJI, 23 AIR CADET I Watch out! 30 more steps! Get in line now! Straight line! In position. This is it, the Pangeran Diponegoro bomber plane. Shall we, Mr. President? Turn right, move! -When will it be completed? -Tjipto! Permission, Sir. It will be ready as soon as possible. Good. Permission, Mr. President! The paint is still wet. Please take note. Honesty above all else. Someday one of you will fly this mighty plane. These gentlemen are your role models. Commander Soerja, Commander Tjipto with their amazing maneuvers. Therefore... don't ever doubt yourself. Don't ever question yourself. Spread your wings and fly! Yes, Sir! CADET 1947 One year after independence, the Republic of Indonesia negotiated with the Netherlands to obtain recognition of sovereignty. The negotiation went on bitterly for months. In the end, the Netherlands agreed to withdraw their troops. Four months later, the Netherlands violated the agreement and carried out a large-scale military offensive, starting on all air bases on July, 1947. Someday I'll be flying one of those. Aren't you afraid? What if you crash? Imagine seeing the world from up there. One with the clouds. I'll bring a handful... ...for you. Congor Merah were equipped with SMG and explosives. Nimble in the air and deadly on the ground. But... the one that destroyed the other airbases was this, Buto Ijo. Big... and green. It can carry up to one ton of explosives. If this plane attacks us and we're down below, it means… see you on the other side. Fortunately, all of us in Bugis moved fast to secure the area. So there were not many casualties. -What about Maguwo? -Yes, Sir. No significant changes. A cadet training with Tjureng became Congor Merah's target. The plane was destroyed. The pilot survived despite a delayed parachute deployment. All our jets are hidden in the jungle. Right now, they're moving slowly towards Jogja. They know the government is based here. I knew there was no use negotiating with the enemy. What about Pangeran Diponegoro? Yes, Sir. It's secured, unlike the other planes, Sir. Is it ready for war? Not yet, Sir. We haven't found the fuel pump replacement. For now we wait for orders from the commander-in-chief. So for the time being... we defend. I can't wait to hit the Dutches back! -Tjipto. -Yes, Sir. While we wait, prepare all the planes and crews. Find a way to get Diponegoro airborne. Yes, Sir. MAGUWO -Where are the planes? -Hidden in the jungle. And where are the cadets? Go past the end of the runway. They're building decoy planes. All right. Steady. Assemble! We are at war. We defend our independence by defending Maguwo. All pilots must undergo simulation training everyday, all day. Cadets... continue building the decoy planes. -Yes, Sir. -Yes, Sir. Carry on! Sigit. -How are you doing? -Ready to take orders, Sir. -Go help the others. -Yes, Sir. Mul, are we really at war? Yes, Git. The Dutch have started moving from Tegal. Which way? By way of both north and west. Striding along the south coast. Guerilla News. Guerilla movement in the south coast is getting more active as citizens are being evacuated including the villages of Wonokromo, Tirang and Kesirat. -Mul, it's Kesirat. -Isn't it Asih's village? I must go there. I'll ask Commander Tjip for permission. -Thank you. -Hold on, Git. We have work to do. Two decoy planes must be ready by today. Probably all of them have been evacuated to a safer place. Let's go. Damn it. What would our parents think. They must have thought we were flying planes. Look at what we're doing. We need to be given a better role in this war, Har. In your dreams. The war would've ended by then. That's what you think. I'll find a way. Right, ten degrees. Pull right and observe the wind direction. Don't be rash! Git! Two planes. Four explosives. They've wasted their ammunition. You have done a good job. Now we move the decoys a little to the west. Cadets! Continue making decoy planes. Permission, Sir. Maybe this task should be given to the engineers. Because we… ...are ready for bigger responsibilities. I'm entrusting this task to you. This is a big responsibility. Carry on! Yes, Sir. Damn it. The war won't end this way. I'm going to practice flying. With what, Ji? They're training with a flight simulator in the hangar. That means nobody is using the planes in the jungle. Let's go, Mul. No. Our order is to build these. Mul, I must watch Adji so he doesn't do something stupid. If anyone asks, we're looking for bamboo. Faster! They won't give us even the slightest chance. So always be on alert. On alert. Three. Damn it. Next. What are you doing here? Nothing. We're looking for more vines for the decoy planes. Don't lie. KARDI AIR FORCE SERGEANT If you return now and carry on with your duty, Commander Tjip won't know. -Yes, Sir. -We're sorry. Thank you. Freedom. -Freedom. -Freedom. Satisfied? There's one more plane. No one would be using it for training. You're outvoted. -Here is some rice to break fast. -Thank you, Ma'am. Follow me. -What will we get? -Not now. It was just a chicken. How are you, my love? Please be patient. Soon, we will fly together. And we will kick the Dutch out. Wake up, Ji. Stop daydreaming. Why don't we use this in the attacks? We can't. Fuel pump's busted. -Can't we take it from another plane? -We can't. All our planes are looted from the Japanese. This plane is one of a kind. We can't use Guntei's or Hayabusa's pump. ASIAN FORTRESS Wait. Remember I told you I once found a crashed plane? -Back when you met Asih? -Exactly. I'd watched the planes from the edge of a cliff. One was covered in smoke. Then it crashed into the valley. For three months, I searched for it but to no avail. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. What I'm asking is did you see writing like this? Yes, Ji. I did. I can read your mind, Ji. That plane is damaged. It crashed. It's destroyed and burnt. Like you've seen it. Is that true? The fuel pump inside the engine might have survived. Give me a break. It's just an excuse to visit your girlfriend's village, right? No. If we can bring it back to life, we would be heroes. -One step closer to becoming a pilot. -Becoming a lunatic, for sure. I'll talk to Commander Tjip. Slow down. What is it? Permission, Sir. Sigit has an important information. Permission, Sir. I think I saw the remains of Pangeran Diponegoro I. -Where is it? -Permission, Sir. It's right here, Sir. Permission, Sir. We can recover its fuel pump. Then we install it on Pangeran Diponegoro II, Sir. This area is past the demarcation line. It's too risky. Permission, Sir. We must move as soon as possible. If an expedition leader is required, I'm ready, Sir, while the pilots are training. Hang on. -Sit down. -Yes, Sir. I was once like you guys. No one can subdue the fire than burns in me. Commander Karbol and I flew Diponegoro from Bugis to Maguwo. Commander Soerja was furious. We were punished. We were ordered to return to Bugis. Just the two of us. It wouldn't budge, not even a centimeter. Permission, Sir. Why was it moved? Diponegoro's presence would boost everyone's morale. I wanted to be the cause of that. Not long after, Diponegoro's engine broke and stopped working. No one blamed me, but it kept me thinking. If only I didn't move it, things might be different. Don't make the same mistake. You must think this through. Really through. Permission, Sir. But this is for the people, Sir. For the nation. Is that really true, Ji? Let me handle this matter. Oh, yeah. Mul said you went looking for bamboo. Where are they? Permission, Sir. I have a complaint about them. Why did they put this bamboo inside the barracks? I'm sorry, Mul. Permission, Sir. Mul! Thank you. Don't drag me into this. Next time, please follow the order. You bet. Git. Don't you want to know if your girlfriend has been evacuated? Of course I do. If so, why don't we go there? Might as well look for the fallen plane. You have a death wish? You heard what Commander Tjip said? No one asked you to come. Relax. We leave in a small group. Get in and out quickly. The Dutch will never know. What we need is engineers to help us dismantle the engine. There's one who's good at combat. We need your help. TARDJO FLIGHT ENGINEER -On who's order? -Commander Tjip's. He trusts your capability. -Did he really say that? -He did. Didn't he, Git? -But this is a top secret mission. -Top secret? No one else should know about this, be it the pilots, guards or chief of engineer. Because we don't know who's on the Dutch side. -Even in Maguwo? -Even in Maguwo. I'm with you 100%. Anything else I can do to help? We need one more engineer to help dismantling. I'm ready to assist. Dul, the new engineer who can dismantle engines but can't assemble them, yet. -Perfect! -Perfect? Yes. And we also need weapons for protection. Weapons... Slowly. -Freedom. -Freedom. Aren't you the cadet who was shot down by Congor Merah? That's correct. He's being punished. You almost died and you're being punished? Because he survived but the plane didn't. A plane is not cheap. It's difficult to be a pilot. Better off as a engineer or a guard in a warehouse, right? Not really. Come on! Excuse me. Can you help me move this? My buddy here… he has trembling hands because of Congor Merah. We don't want to explode like fireworks. Shall we? Are you crazy? -I'm still a virgin. -Me too. -Let's go find ourselves a wife together. -You're nuts. Thank you. I hope you find a wife soon. You guys are crazy. Don't worry, Mul. We'll be back before sunset. Come on, help us. Find a way so no one knows, okay? That's more like it. It's clear. -Do not give him any weapons. -Why? I'm so sorry. -Let's go. -Tardjo? Come on! It's for the Dutch. That handkerchief. What's the story? She gave it to me when I entered Maguwo. I'll return it to her when I'm done. That's what women do. For reasons we'd never know. What is your future wife like? She'd always help anyone who's in trouble. It's tough for me, especially in these conditions. My advice is if you have attachments, don't go to war. Don't join the military. You'll gain nothing but pain. A soldier without attachments can fight to the fullest. Aren't these attachments fueling our courage to fight? Where did your courage go? Tardjo. What's on your mind? Family? Lover? No time to say goodbye? I'm sorry, Sigit. This war knows no end. The Dutch, Japanese, and Dutch again. There will always be war as long as people remain greedy. So the options are go to war wholeheartedly or go home and love wholeheartedly. -Mul? -Yes, Sir. Commander Tjip wants us to assemble. Yes, Sir. All right. Straight line! In position. Count off from two! Count off! Two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten! At ease! -Kardi. -Yes, Sir. Sort the pilots based on this list. Yes, Sir. Listen up! Cadets are to fix explosives on the Guntei and reload the ammos on Hayabusa. Get the engineer's help. Understand? Yes, Sir! Permission to ask, Sir. Can I fly too? Be patient. All in the right time. Yes, Sir. Listen up. All in the right time. Attention! Dismissed! Maybe all of them have evacuated. What is it, Ji? Nothing. We have to move. -Git. -Sigit! Sigit! Asih's not here. Is it still far ahead? Come. Go that way. What is it, Sir? Help! Help! It's the Dutch! Stop! You, search! Commander. Commander. Search over there and here! On the right. Search the right. Come on. One step closer to being a pilot. Hide! He's clever for an old man. Stop! Everyone rest. I'm going to take a leak. Six. Tardjo. Where is it? It's going to explode! What now? Let's move! Their comrades will be looking for them. This is what we're looking for. -Is it still working? -It should be. What now? -Har, can I return it now? -Not now. This doesn't feel right. And I'm not cut out for this. But you look like a real fighter pilot, Kaput. Impossible for me. I don't have it in my blood. My grandfather sold sugarcane. My father sold cendol. When I'm done, my choices are sugarcane or cendol. -Come with me. -Wait. Get up there. Hurry! Hurry, Put. Har! Get inside, Put. Get in. How does it feel? So have your grandfather and father entered a cockpit before? This makes you different. Your future is different, too! It has nothing to do with your lineage. -Where's Har? -Yes, Sir! Listen closely. Don't ever dream of flying with us. -Understand? Got it? -Yes, Sir. Got it, Sir. Is this also the direction to Maguwo? -What's wrong, Sir? -It's nothing. My son is there. Really? My fiancé is there too. Perhaps they're friends? Perhaps. Maybe they're good friends. After everything calms down, let's go there together. But now we must get to the shelter. It's done, Sir. -Thank you, Miss. -You're welcome. WATCH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. ENEMY SPIES ARE AROUND US. Bastards. Where are you going, Republic rats? Nobody raises their hands. Freedom! Freedom! Who is that guy? He's our golden asset. He's their leader. Hands up! -I see you're carrying out your order. -Yes, Sir. We've recovered some spare parts for the Pangeran Diponegoro plane in a river near Kesirat village. Escort them back to Maguwo. Yes, Sir. -You. Carry on. -Yes, Sir! You're lucky that he's inspecting the troops at the frontline. Permission, Sir. Are there still some refugees on their way? Leave it to us. Is that all you think about, Git? You should be praying for the plane to fly again. Why were your men near the borders, Tjip? The commander-in-chief used his escort vehicles to take them back to Maguwo. My apologies. Without my consent, it seems they were trying to recover a spare part -from the Diponegoro I-- -I don't care! I don't care if they stole food from the neighbors! This should not happen again. Yes, Sir. I'll accept your punishment. Punishing officers at this time would make me a fool. Make sure they're disciplined. Yes, Sir. One more thing. The reason I called you here... The Dutch took over Semarang and Salatiga. The citizens have been evacuated to Jogja. Medical supplies are running low. We have orders to fly to Singapore to get medical aid. I need men I can trust to go. -It'll be Karbol... -Yes, Sir. -...Tjipto... -Yes, Sir. ...and Marmo. Permission, Sir. What about Maguwo? Ready to back you up, Tjip. Permission, Sir. It's the Black Mascot who went on many flying missions and would bring his troops home safely. Halim. You've crossed our waters and conquered European skies. The news likes to exaggerate. Everybody knows that the news is actually being modest. Tjipto. Can we trust Halim to take helm at Maguwo? Yes, Sir. I would trust him with my life. Good. Then, take care of the transfer immediately. Yes, Sir. Help. Are there more refugees? I think we're the last ones, Sir. We tried our best to avoid the Dutch. -We went through the jungle. -Let's move. Sir, are we passing through Maguwo? All refugees are centered in the city. Wait a minute. Sir. Shall we? I need to get to Maguwo, Miss. I was once captured by the Dutch. They told me... they contacted my son. He had to be their spy or they would kill me. Maguwo is in danger, Miss. Hurry! Adji. Lights are on. Why did you stop? Up! Legs up! Permission to join. Fall back! Permission not granted. Fall back. Yes, Sir. As I've said before... whoever hangs on the longest will decide the punishment for this misconduct. Ready! Seven minutes, ten seconds. Har, listen. Har. Don't punish Adji. Whatever you do, don't punish Adji. Or we will all be in trouble. Up! Everybody up! -Name it. -Permission, Sir. Discharge him from Maguwo. -Reason? -Bad influence on the others... who really wish to learn, Sir. Not a single person is leaving Maguwo. Everybody stays. All cadets will receive the same punishment. No flying until you graduate. Permission, Sir. Does that mean... we will not become pilots? That's correct. Isn't that too much? What do you think? I'm just worried. What if they're not as strong as us? What if they leave? Then leave. Only the best will last. I entrust Maguwo to you. Conquer the sky. Conquer the heart. Why are you still here? I want to see you guys lamenting your fate. Go away. It doesn't have to be like this, Ji! So all of you blame me for this? Pangeran Diponegoro came back to life because of me! Weren't you all happy about it? Getting shot at by the Dutch. I almost died! Almost died! For you! I just realized… that you're a bunch of hypocrites! -Where are you going? -To find Asih Attention! Finally, the order we've been awaiting. We'll attack the Dutch at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. You're ordered to move all planes from the jungle to the runway. Now, move. Push! In position! Stop! -Tardjo, get it ready. -Yes, Sir. Everybody move! Commander Kardi! -Permission. -Yes. -Where's Commander Halim? -Headquarters, discussing strategies. He told me to get the planes ready. He'll be here before the attack. -Shouldn't we move Pangeran Diponegoro? -No need. Leave it there. -Why? -That's an order, Mul! Yes, Sir. Kardi! Permission, Sir. Mul. Something's up with Kardi. We'll move slowly. Check on Pangeran Diponegoro. Ji! No one's guarding it. It's safe, Mul. Let's inspect. What's that? Help me. Hurry! Get ready at the hangar! What do you think? Don't I look cool? Don't worry, Har. We will win this war. -Tell all your friends. -Yes, Sir. It's happening. Maguwo. Protect Pangeran Diponegoro! Why are you doing this? We've lost, Har. You better get out of here. And Pangeran Diponegoro? I have marked it. It's no use, Har! Make way! Get out! Get out! Everybody out! Mul! Ji. Har. -Git. -No! Dont! Don't! Har! It's all right. Bear with it, Sigit! Come on, Har. -Where's Mul? -He's still inside. Mul! Mul! -Wim. -Mul! Mul! Mul! Mul? Mul! Mul. Asih. Kardi issued an order using my name to move all the planes to the runway. He marked the barn where Pangeran Diponegoro was hidden. Then he gave the Dutch a signal to attack, Sir. And the planes? All of them are damaged... except the training planes as they weren't targeted. -Any casualties? -15 dead. The rest are terribly wounded and haven't been evacuated. Order to evacuate from Maguwo. Yes, Sir. Asih? Sigit. Did you fly? What was it like? Exciting. Fun. Weren't you afraid? So where is it? The cloud you promised me? The truck will be here any minute. We can evacuate together. What is it? Nothing. From now on... we'll always be together. Forgive me, my son. Forgive me… If only I made it in time… Har! Listen! Enough, Ji. What else can we do? We can still avenge them. For Kardi and the rest. We have no more pilots. Like it or not, they will pick us. Git? You're really something. Sigit? Sir. Sir. Tell me. Did my son betray this country? Sir. I'll tell you the truth. Kardi… He informed the Dutch that... ...that Maguwo can never be conquered. That the Republic will never surrender. -That's what happened? -That's correct. Kardi fought until his last dying breath. He was protecting his friends. Everyone who's here... is still alive... still living... still breathing. Everyone here survived because of Kardi. And we will carry on what Kardi fought for. We'll defend Maguwo and our country until our last dying breath. After I bury my son... can I fight alongside you? Thank you. Those who can't fight, don't push yourself. Those who can, assemble at the hangar. Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! I must join them. -What are you doing? -We'll always be together, right? But this is dangerous. Everywhere is dangerous. Besides, I can help. Come on. Mul. Let's disassemble the other planes. There should be parts we can use for Hayabusa and Guntei. -That means we only have two planes left. -Four. We have four planes. Those are training planes. We can't equip them with ammo. Can we change that, Put? I'll do my best. Besides me and Adji... we need two more men to fly the planes. Right behind you! We'll make mincemeat out of the Dutch! Pilots first. Wait. Are you serious? Using broken planes to attack? What are we targeting? The Dutch bases. That's suicide, Mul! They have Congor Merah. If they retaliate, we're dead in seconds. Sigit was lucky to survive. -We don't know what else they have. -It's fine, Wim. Willing participants only. I'm ready. I'll help Sigit. One more. Are you sure, Har? Kaput, you're with me. Get ready. My fellow engineers, please do your best to weaponize the planes. Yes, Sir! I can't think of a reason, but I think I must go over there. You lied. What actually happened? What is Congor Merah? The enemy plane. I was shot down during training. I'm sorry. I didn't… I'm sorry. I didn't want you to worry. So you're leaving again? I promise I'll be back. I've heard that before. I would believe you more if you promised otherwise. Don't say that. I can't do this. I'm sorry. If you leave... then I'm leaving. I can't handle this. I'm sorry. Asih. Impossible. They won't let us, Mul. No permission, no flying, period. Git. Let's go to the headquarters. We plan to attack the Dutch. Permission to receive orders, Sir. Do you realize what you just asked? In the worst case scenario, this will become a suicide mission. We're ready to do it, Sir. They're still serving their punishment, Sir. They're not allowed to fly. Permission to suspend the punishment temporarily, Sir. -What's your name? -It's Mulyono, Sir. You shouted in front of the President, right? Yes, Sir. That's right. One Guntei. One Hayabusa. Two Tjurengs. -What do you think, Lim? -Sir. One air strike will make the Dutch think carefully before making another move. And this will help boost our troops' morale on the ground, Sir. You've put me in a difficult position. If I gave you the permission... it would mean sending you on a dangerous mission. Whereas, you're here to learn. You still have a future ahead of you. If I didn't grant you permission... I'd be betraying my conscience. Let us fly, Sir. All right. When I call you, step forward. -Mulyono! -Yes, Sir. -Sigit. -Yes, Sir. -Harbani. -Yes, Sir. -Sapto Adji. -Yes, Sir. I'm not giving you orders. But I'm not stopping you either. Halim will assist you with a strategy. YOGYAKARTA MAGUWO Our main target is Semarang. Guntei and Hayabusa will go through the east route at full speed. Use the dog lag tactic, Go over Ungaran Mountain, and then pull to north of Semarang, where the Dutch base is. Drop the bomb twice. Your main target is the hangar, then the artillery and the logistic. Leave nothing behind. Hayabusa will fire at the center of the Dutch base as a distraction so Guntei can go in. Tjureng I, Tjureng II... you move through the west route, then turn to the east after the Merbabu. Remember! Not to the east of Merapi. Your main target is the armory. You'll take off at dawn when it's still dark. This is our chance to succeed. And the Dutch will never expect this strike. We didn't expect this either. There's always a chance to retreat. We'll keep moving forward. After the attack... all of you head back to Maguwo immediately. Use the tree top tactic. Fly low just above the trees, so Congor Merah can't spot you. Remember! When the sun rises and you're still not back, we'll assume that you've failed. Then we'll evacuate Maguwo immediately in anticipation of a counter attack. Now get ready. Yes, Sir! Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. O, to our country We promise O, to our country We serve Loyal. -We are loyal. -Loyal? O, to our country We serve O, for our country Are our bodies and souls. O, to our country Git. We promise O, to our country We are loyal O, to our country We serve O, for our country Are our bodies and souls. -Freedom. -Freedom. Freedom. Attention! Salute! Attention! Cadets. I'll be waiting for you here. Yes, Sir! Salute! Attention! Permission. There's a problem. Oil leak, Commander Halim. We could fly it, but it'd explode in the sky. I understand, Basir. -Mul, you're flying without escort. -Yes, Sir. What are you waiting for? Move! Hurry! Ji... fly my plane. Kaput. HARBANI, BORN ON LAND PERISH IN THE SKY -PILOT. Hey! Fool! This is your time. I brought food for the boys. Sir. We'll wait for their return. Kick them out. Then come home to me. Wim. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! What about the others? We lost them. We were too slow. 15 minutes at 250. Kaput! Sigit disappeared. A while ago! Why didn't you tell me? What's down there? A bomb. It's heavy. Down there! Below! Too dark. Did you catch it, Put? I did. A little bit. Dutch! Kaput, we must go up. But they'll spot us. There's no other way. Semarang. Logistic warehouse. Bullseye! Congor Merah. We'll finish this mission before we die, Kaput. Agreed. My thighs are already numb. Throw it! Let's take him down! Freedom! It's them. Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Mr. President, Dutch bases in Semarang, Salatiga and Ambarawa were hit by air strikes from our forces in Maguwo. My brother, send this news to all of our forces. Yes, Sir. Har! Congratulations, all of you. But your task is not done. Hide all the planes in the jungle! -Carry it out. -Yes, Sir! Come on! Ready for the next order, Commander Halim. Our next mission is to defend Maguwo with our bodies and souls. We'll show the world Republic of Indonesia's air sovereignty. Yes, Sir. Congratulations. I'm proud of you. Freedom! Freedom! The air strike on July 29, 1947 was the first air operation in history that cemented the Republic of Indonesia's existence across the international world.
