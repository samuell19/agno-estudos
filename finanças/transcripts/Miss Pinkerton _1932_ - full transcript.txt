[intense music] [music continues] [screaming] Headquarters, send over the homicide squad. Tenth and Sylvan Avenue. Attention, car 48, car 40. 'Go to Tenth and Sylvan , report to Inspector Patten' 'at the old Mitchell home.' This is Mr. Glenn speaking. Oh good gracious! I'll run over right away. This is Dr. Stuart speaking. What? We'll be right over. [engine revving] Yeah, yeah, I got it right here. Herbert Wynn, yeah. Shot? What was it, murder or suicide? No-no. Oh, I see. When did it happen? At the old Mitchell residence on Sylvan Avenue, huh? Oh, yeah-yeah, I know the old Mitchell estate. Who found the body? Body found by his aunt, Juliet Mitchell who collapsed, and is now under care of her personal physician. Alright, stick on the case. I'll hold a rewrite man here in case anymore comes in. So this is romance. Three pair of tonsils and a breakaway kidney. - All in one day. - I'm busy too, Adams. I think, I'm losing my mind. Probably it's gone away someplace with mine. - 'It wasn't your play.' - 'It was.' Well, Russian Bank. A nice game of Russian Bank, it just picks me up. Like a psychopathic ward. - You got a date? - Oh, no such luck. I smell so of chloroform, no one but a guy with a gas mask would make a pass at me. Oh, I'm tired with my board. I think I'll donate my body to science and commit suicide. Stop. You forgot to put the nine on the eight. You can all stop as far as I'm concerned. 'This place is getting in your hair?' It's in my hair, my eyes, my teeth, my nose and it itches. I'm beginning to envy the patients. Things happen to them, they live or they die. Thrills in our routine are as common as wisecracks in an algebra book. (female #2) 'It's your play.' I'm going to bed. Oh, why doesn't someone do something to break the monotony? You called me for the same thing. If we're going to play, please show a little sportsmanship. Can either of you do any acrobatic dancing? It would be much more interesting. [knock on door] Come in. Miss Adams, report to the superintendent at once. Yeah and snap in to it. [door closing] Here's the address, and ask for Dr. Stuart. The old Mitchell house. I know where that is. Take a taxi. Something must've happened. You'll be told. Do I report back to you? No, to.. I may as well tell you, this is an unusual case. You're really working for police headquarters. 'Inspector Patten will introduce himself to you when you arrive.' 'Now, there may be some excitement.' 'Nervous strain involved in it.' 'If you don't want to go, I'll send someone else.' But on the other hand, I think you're fitted to the job. If you don't mind a change from a hospital routine. Mind a change? Oh, lady, if you only knew. [car engine revving] Here's a dollar. Keep the change. - There is no change. - Then we're even. Dr. Stuart, please. There's Dr. Stuart, right there. - Miss Adams? - Yes, Dr. Stuart. Your patient Miss Mitchell is upstairs. Nervous shock case. She's at a dangerous age. - What shocked her? - It's rather serious. Her nephew shot himself tonight, and she found the body. Oh! This is your room. Your patient is in the adjoining room. Thank you. Sure you didn't open it yourself? Positive, sir. Well, a man might get out that window with a ladder. If he did it, he'd leave footprints a yard deep. - The nurse is here, inspector. - Downstairs? No. In the room she's been assigned. Fine, I'll see her right away. Now don't stall. It won't do you any good. Did you this one? I didn't touch it, sir. I swear it on the holy book. I found it that way. When Miss Juliet screamed, and I came running up. But somebody did it. That I'll swear to. He couldn't kill himself, not the kind he was. But somebody did it. And that's where they got away. Why don't they go away? Tell 'em, he was cleaning his gun. Cowards like him don't shoot themselves. There-there, now don't talk and don't fret. He's alright, now. Safe in his savior's arms. What was that? How do you do? Are you feeling better now? I'm the new nurse. Adams is the name. How do you do? - Who was that? - That's the coroner. They were expecting him for the autopsy. Autopsy, I won't permit it. I won't have that-- Now, you must be quiet. Please. Let go of me. Let me go. Please, please. (Nurse Adams) 'Dr. Stuart, Dr. Stuart.' Yes. Please, hurry. She's fainted. Hypodermic of amyl nitrate. Yes, doctor. It's ready. Is she alright? That's good. Did you butt in just to ask that? Say, listen, there's a cop around here named Patten that'll wring your neck if you mess things up. No kidding. The feet fooled me. No bunion. I beg your pardon, inspector. Don't apologize, I liked the way you dodged the issue. Sit down. You've had hospital experience, police and emergency cases? Yes along with the rest. Alright, now tell me something. If a bullet passes through a man's head what's the outstanding result? A hole, I suppose. (inspector) 'And in case of suicide?' Powder burns. Why? There were no powder marks on that kid's body. He cleaned his gun, alright. But he didn't kill himself He didn't commit suicide. - You mean, he-- - I mean, murder. Who? That's what we're gonna find out. What you're gonna find out. - Me? - Sure. You're working for me now. Oh, I see. Well, what's my rank? - Uh, what? - My rank, my title. If I'm gonna be with the police force, what am I? A female cop or a disinfected stool pigeon? Ah, let's see. You're a Pinkerton. That's it. Miss Pinkerton of Scotland Yard. Oh, that's swell. Well, what next? Well, for the moment, just listen. Young Wynn was killed by somebody he knew. He was unlacing his shoe. And looking up at the face of whoever shot him. [knock on the door] (Mary) 'Miss Adams.' Yes. - You're coming, now? - Yes, I am. Oh, then, I-I won't disturb her. I'll look in again tomorrow. Yes, do so. I hope she'll be well enough to see you. (Dr. Stuart) 'Oh, inspector.' Shake hands with Arthur Glenn, Miss Mitchell's lawyer. - Just the man I wanna see. - Anything I can do to help? Yes, there's one point. Did young Wynn carry any life insurance? He did carry some insurance. I don't know how much. I'll look it up. Much obliged. Goodnight. Oh-oh. Excuse me. - Keep your eyes open. - Yes, sir. [wind blowing] [scratching on door] Well, hello fella, come on in. Come on. Come on in. You could stay in here tonight, palsy-walsy. Come here, you. Get right out. Come here! Now, you get right outside. You can't stay here. Right out, go on. Would you please do me a favor and go to bed. Do as she says, Mary. - Goodnight, Miss Juliet. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Shall I take one of these pillows away? - No-no. - Alright. [wind howling] Nurse, nurse. Oh, oh. I can't breathe. Yes you can. Now breathe deeply. That's it. Stay here. Don't leave me. I'm afraid. Something might happen. Something terrible. [clock chiming] - What? - Shh. Your breakfast is downstairs, miss. Oh, good morning. A swell nurse I am. Need more sleep than my patient. Slip away from her and hide this. She's been watching me all night. Don't you worry about her. [door closing] In here, miss. [doorbell ringing] Is that the doorbell? Yes, miss. Excuse me. Morning, Hugo. You're looking fit this morning. Thank you, sir. No one is allowed in here, miss. I was just looking for something to read. At breakfast, miss? Well, frankly, Hugo I come from a long distinguished line of billy goats. And we always like to gobble a few chapters of Shakespeare before we tackle our corn flakes. Miss Adams. - Morning, Miss Pinkerton. - Adams to you. Did you get out on the wrong side of the bed? I haven't been anywhere near a bed. I'm a mattress loving maiden. I don't belong here. Neither do I. I oughta be in a hospital, examining my head. - Why are you so candid? - Look at this, will you? 'I don't see anything. unless for that white spot.' Is that a defect in the film? Defect? Don't let the photographer hear you say that. That's the answer to this case. If only had sense to know it. That's the corner of a newspaper. There was a newspaper by the body. What's that got to do? It's got everything to do. Wynn took out a $100,000 life insurance before he shot himself. Glenn, Miss Mitchell's attorney just told me. 100,000. Then he killed himself to leave that to the-- That's what he did, alright. The Mitchell family were broke, down to the last cent. He spent all the money shot his health to pieces. Well, he was through, I guess. But was he smart? Wait, watch this. Now, I'm gonna kill myself, see. Only insurance companies don't pay off quickly on suicide. It's got to look like a murder or an accident. Alright, now here's what I do. First, I take some oil and rags, like he did. The kinda stuff used to clean a gun. Then I take the paper like this. Kneel down, take my gun, shoot a hole through the paper. Once I fall, the paper falls into place. When you pick it up, it's alright. 'What about the powder burn?' Inside, instead of on me, smart, huh? It's been done lots of times. I must have overlooked. In the meantime, somebody got in here and took that newspaper. - That's what they were hiding. - Did you see it? The lady got out, and I caught her when she sneaked back. Her feet were black with dirt. She hid something under her pillow. Morning, Mary went to the library to hide it. It might have been the newspaper. Probably thrown out by now. Where do they keep the newspapers here? There's an incinerator in the backyard. Hugo burns them, I guess. You wait until dark, and take a look. Keep your eyes open. I'll get down to headquarters. Maybe, some cop picked it up, and took it there. - Gee, I hope so. - Ah, just my luck. This is the first case they've assigned to me all by myself. And here I go and bungle it right off the bat. Probably be walking the beat next time. Oh, now stop, will you? You'll have me crying on your shoulder. I've kept your breakfast on the table, miss. It's getting cold. My breakfast? Oh, yes. Of course. Could you hear what they said? No. But she's too friendly with that inspector. Don't let her go in there. 'What are you looking for? Footprints or ladder marks?' How should I know? Well, maybe you don't, but what are you doing here? After all, you're a nurse, you'll understand. I've got to talk to somebody, or I'll go crazy. You're a friend of the late Herbert Wynn, aren't you? - Oh, yes. He, we-- - Sweethearts? Yes. Oh, it seems so impossible that he's dead. - I know who killed him. - He shot himself. No-no, he didn't. Don't let them tell you that. He was murdered. I know who did it. Come on, we better go in the house. Someone might hear us. Wait a minute. I've got to see how my patient is. Take everything she'll tell and hold her till somebody comes. Yeah. We'll tail her if she leaves. Make it snappy. Don't be frightened, kid. Now, what were you gonna tell me? I don't know. Maybe, I better not. Better get it off your chest. Alright, first of all, I was engaged to Herbert Wynn. They killed him for his insurance. They were desperate. The bank was gonna take the house. - Who killed him? - Hugo, I think. Old lady knew. She was in it. They were all in it. They hated him. He was afraid. He knew someone was after him. One night, he saw someone in the dark. After that he always took his gun along. He couldn't have shot himself. Oh, you must believe me. I do, only you ought to tell the police. But I can't. My family. It would be awful if my name came into it. I must go now. I don't want anyone to see me here. Wait a minute. What is your name? I can't tell you, I can't. It's impossible. Goodbye, then. [engine revving] [screaming] You must have fainted. Are you hurt, miss? Oh. Hurt? I'm dead. Something hit you, miss? No, I tripped. I saw something go through that door. No one got out there, miss. That door is locked and bolted. Always has been. We never use it. What were you doing down there? I, I couldn't sleep. That is, I heard a noise. So, I got this, and went in the parlor. I watched and then, I must have dozed. You say, you heard a noise? I don't know what, a kind of knocking or creeping more like. Why don't you go outside and look? I think, I'll stay down in the parlor, miss. Well, just as you say. Only-- Perhaps, you had better go to your room. Okay, but it's a cinch I won't sleep now. - Goodnight, miss. - Goodnight. '"County Coroner James A. Klempf' '"last night wrote finis to the inquiry' 'started by police into the mysterious tragic death "of youthful Herbert Wynn. Autopsy proves beyond a doubt that the death was accidental." It's a great relief, Juliet. (Juliet) 'In what way?' In every way. The poor boy is gone, and we can't bring him back. 'This means security for you and I'm most happy for your sake.' 'Now, the insurance will be paid.' Oh, no. But I don't want blood money. Oh, don't look at it that way. Don't you see, there's no taint on the money. It's due, legally and fairly. It's a Godsend, Miss Juliet. That'll do, Mary. It'll help, I don't deny that. But I wish it could have come some other way. So do I. So do all of us. But let's be thankful. Times are hard, Juliet. I know they are, for me at least. By this indemnity. (male #1) 'Have you read this?' Ah, brilliant that coroner. Sees all and knows nothing. If he thinks for one minute he's closed this case, he's crazy. [dog barking] Well, what's the matter, fella? You still hungry after all those pork chops. Right here. There. Don't forget if you meet me in the dark. I'm your palsy-walsy. Get out of here. [dog barking] You ought to be killed. Bedtime, Miss Mitchell. The doctor wants you to drink this before you go to sleep. Doctors are all alike. Even Stuart. I don't trust any of 'em. Never did. [screaming] Go around on that side. Come on, Patten. [Miss Adams screaming] - What's in there? - My room. But you can't open it. It's locked. - I don't have the key. - I can't, eh? Are you sure you are alright? Yes, I'm alright. He went through that door. (Patten) 'Quick, boys. Wynn's room.' Stand aside. I'll shoot the lock. [gunshot] (Patten) 'Stick 'em up.' 'Come on.' 'Come on out here.' They don't make doors like that anymore. It's solid oak. Pretty calm, aren't you? Don't bother, I haven't a gun. I'm looking for a bunch of keys. How did you get in the house? Maybe, I found the doors open. Riley, take a look around and see if this fellow threw a bunch of keys out the window. - I'm arresting you. - For what? Housebreaking? That'll do until we find the keys. And then what? Suspicion of first degree murder. You won't need the bracelets. Take him downstairs to the front door and wait. I want to see if Miss Adams is alright. Alright, come on, get down here. Here's some keys, chief. I found 'em under the window. 'Herbert Wynn's keys.' Where did you get these? That would be telling stories out of school. Alright, take him down. Book him for murder. Wrong again, Sherlock Holmes. That boy did not kill Wynn. Ah, just like a woman. You mustn't let those good-looking eyes and that calm, innocent, baby-face fool you. If I wanna be fooled, I'd put myself in your shoes. Now, this is no time to argue. I've got the murderer, or at least an accomplice. - That's certain. - He didn't do it. - Who did? - Wynn killed himself. Now look. You're so infernally smart. 'A newspaper?' What did he break in here tonight for? Well, I'm no mind-reader. Maybe we should call in a detective on the case. Well, this paper doesn't mean anything. He broke in here that night, and used the keys to open the door. - Did the same thing tonight. - Walked like a ghost I suppose. He did not walk through that door like a ghost. He knew the combination of that secret door all the time. Let me see that paper again. Well, it's ten days old. Well, don't the powder burns prove something? No, not necessarily. He could've arranged that ten days ago. Brought it to make it look like a suicide. You are pulling rabbits out of a hat. Well, anyway, the handsome young man will have to give me mighty good reasons for having those keys. You know, all juries are not made up of susceptible good-looking blondes like yourself, Adams. Remind me to hate you, will you, Patten? [bell tolling] 'What was it? What was it?' Oh, they caught a fellow named Elliott, in Mr. Herbert room. They are gonna charge him with the murder. Charlie Elliott? A young, dark haired boy? 'Yes.' Oh! Oh! Oh. Send for Arthur Glenn at once. Well, not now. He's gone home, and it's getting very late. Well, then, in the morning. The first thing. 'I must make a statement.' A statement? 'Yes, a statement.' (Juliet) 'Knowing that I have not long to live.' 'And that I soon must face my maker.' I make this statement. To prevent a great injustice.. ...being done. I make it of my own free will. And in full possession of my faculties. But I request.. ...what I'm about to say should be kept secret. Except-- If this is to be of confidential nature I better take it down myself. Would you mind, Miss Adams? No, of course not. I think you better step out too, Miss Lenz. Certainly. You might wait in Miss Adams' room where I can call you. Alright. [door closes] Psst. - What do you want? - You've gotta help me. I'm half mad. If you think you can create a sensation by going crazy, you are mistaken. The house is already full of nuts. One more night of this, and I'll lead the parade. Charlie got arrested and charged for murder. It's all my fault. What? How is it your fault? - What you gotta do with it? - It is my fault. I sent him here last night. To get something from Herbert's room. You left something in there? Yes. I don't care what you think of me. I used to go there to his room. Herbert gave the keys to me. I gave 'em to Charlie last night and that's how he got in. Never mind. Tell me what you want, I'll get it for you. I can't tell, until I find it. My family are strict and they didn't like Herbert But please, I can't tell you anymore. - I can't. - Then I can't let you in. But Charlie's life may depend on it. That's a fine thing to say. If they catch you nosing in-- Oh, you've got to! Let me in, please. Well, alright, come on. I can't make anymore mistakes than the detectives. Well, I like your nerve. Getting powder all over my things. Crown you. So sorry, my dear. So sorry. Paula Brent, aren't you? No accounting for people's tastes, I suppose. I'm afraid I don't understand you. Indeed. Allow me to introduced myself. I am Florence Lenz, L-E-N-Z. Oh, I've heard about you. [knock on door] So, you're the girl-- - Miss Lenz. - Yes. Will you and Ms. Adams step in and witness this signature. Certainly. You understand this statement is confidential. Sign here. (Arthur) 'You are witnessing simply the signature.' Now, Miss Lenz. Thank you. You wish to read this over now, Juliet? After I've rested. Wait downstairs. You are over-tired, Miss Mitchell. - Hello, Arthur. - Good morning. A long statement? Why, she hasn't the strength. (Miss Adams) 'Oh, doctor.' Well, exhaustion naturally. Some uh, amyl nitrate, hypodermic. Hmm. [Juliet moaning] Miss Adams! Miss Adams! 'Yes, doctor.' What was in that hypodermic? She's dead. Get me that hypodermic. But, doctor, it was the regular injection. Get me that hypodermic, do you hear me? I've washed it out, doctor. You've washed it, alright. Used alcohol too. - You didn't waste time. - I'm not trained to waste time. - Where are the tablets? - In my room. It's arsenic. And five grain tablets too. One would have been enough. Oh, but this...this says amyl nitrate. Then arsenic was substituted. That's a very clever deduction. Do I have to tell you what this means to you. It's either a case of negligence-- Doctor, you don't think I did it intentionally. You couldn't! You couldn't! Nevertheless, this calls for a investigation. Having some trouble, doctor? Oh, you might call it that. Patten, Miss Mitchell is dead. - What? - She died five minutes ago. No, no, I'll correct that statement. She was killed five minutes ago. Five grains of arsenic was substituted for a regular hypodermic. And I, uh, I'm due at hospital on a surgical case. I'll notify the coroner from there. There is one more thing. 'I want this nurse held on charges of gross negligence.' 'Or a possible complicity to homicide.' Goodbye. Goodbye. Did you fix that hypodermic? Yes, for heaven sakes-- 'No, no, I'm not suspecting you, am I?' 'Use the brains you were born with.' We've gotta work fast. Now, somebody got here and switched those tablets. Who was it? Who was in this room today, besides yourself and the doctor? Florence Lenz and Paula Brent. 'Brent? How did she get in?' I let her in. She begged me to. Wanted to find something in Herbert's room and Charlie's life depended on it. And you fell for that. What do you mean? I believe the kid, that's all. Detectives are not supposed to believe. - Who said I was a detective? - You aren't. That's certain. Why'd I let you into this? Let me into it? You dragged me into it. I've lost a lot of sleep. and scared myself so much. I'm in shape for an asylum. Never mind. Where is Brent? Up in young Wynn's room, I suppose. Look, do me a favor. Let me go back to the hospital. Go up and hold her until I get there. I must examine Miss. Mitchell's room before anything is touched. Now step on it. Pinkerton. Did you find it? - No, I didn't. - What's this? - Don't take it, you mustn't-- - I'll take a look at that. (Patten) 'Married!' Secretly married to Herbert Wynn and in love with young Elliott. Well, this is news. I want to thank you, Miss Brent for establishing the motive. Now I understand, why Elliott felt that Wynn had to be killed. - You are wrong. - I hardly think so. I'm holding you under arrest for investigation. Why? You can't. - My people wouldn't-- - Take her to headquarters. But, why? I haven't committed any crime. I'm holding you for investigation in the murder of Miss Mitchell Is Miss Mitchell dead? Yes. She was murdered a few minutes ago. You see. That finishes the case. I think I can link both murders by night time. It's a cinch. There is a connection. I think young Elliott is the missing link. Now, listen, young fella. You are badly mistaken. Those kids haven't done a thing wrong. When I get a hunch it's usually good. They are innocent I tell ya. Oh, you've got yourself all worked up over this thing. Your nerves are all shot. What you need is a good rest. What I need is a good shoulder to cry on. Say, you married? - No, are you? - Uh-huh. [clearing throat] Inspector, they want to see you downstairs. Well, now.. ...ah, now, that's better. That's better. Uh, ah, alright. [engine revving] Hey, who are you? The Morning Eagle. The Morning Eagle, eh? Well, go feather your nest. I'm sorry you won't cooperate with me. I've given you every chance. I must warn you that you're hurting your own case. And his too. - Bring in Elliott - Okay. Charlie. I'm sorry, honey. My arms are in use. [softly] Take them off. Take 'em off. (Charlie) 'Love me?' 'Then that's all that matters isn't it, honey?' We won't need you, Miss. Brent. Move over here. (Patten) 'I suppose you know why we brought you here.' To reenact my hideous cold blooded crime for the edification of you numbskulls, I suppose. Oh, you'll have plenty of time to wisecrack in the cooler. You might as well begin at the beginning. Tell us why you came here. Was it a friendly call? I told you there's nothing friendly. I came to see Wynn and tell him not to bother my girl. You mean quit bothering his own wife. - I didn't know about that. - Just what did you know? Wynn had infatuated her. I guess he was a smooth worker. I knew she was in some kind of mess. I didn't ask for particulars. So, I came to Wynn. I was gonna have a showdown. - And kill him if necessary. - No. Sock him, maybe. I never hated anybody bad enough to kill 'em. Go on. I took the keys from her. She didn't want me to have 'em. - We had a tussle over-- - Get the keys to talk to Wynn. - Juliet could've rung the door. - I've explained all that. Wynn knew I didn't like him. He wouldn't talk, if I hadn't surprised him. Oh. I see. What did you do, when you got inside? I came upstairs. I saw light in Wynn's room and then.. And then what? I came into the room. I saw him. He was on the floor. He was dead. I didn't kill him. He was dead when I got in. (Patten) 'Did you call the police?' - 'Did you try and assist--' - 'You know what I did.' I heard somebody coming up the stairs. I knew it'd look bad, so I got out. Out the window. How'd you get down? As far as you're concerned, I flew down. I got him down and brought him here. I was afraid of what he'd do. He whistled from the roof. So, I dragged the ladder over here and got him down. That's a mighty nice story Elliott. What with your looks and your manner you'll get courtroom sympathy. But that isn't all you going to get. There's just one thing you left out. Let's take a look at this dummy. This was how Wynn looked when you saw him. - No. - Well, how did he look? Arrange the body to look exactly as it was when you saw it. Nice work. Looks like a real suicide, alright. Did you as neat a job when you fixed the real corpse? - The real corpse-- - Let's quit stalling. Your story would be swell if somebody hadn't seen you move the body. Got the statement, then? Here it is. Statement was dictated by Miss. Mitchell on her deathbed. I'll read it to you. Uh, you'll hear it in court anyway. I'll tell you what she said and save time. She saw you move the body, Elliot. That was her dying testament. That's a lie. I don't know anything about it. She didn't see you shoot him, but she saw you move the body. I never touched the body. He was dead when I got here. Why make it look like a suicide? I didn't. If she said that, she's lying. She saw you, alright. And you got away fast enough. But you won't get away this time. Not through that window or by someone bringing you a ladder. 'Well, guess that's all we need.' 'You've cleared things up quite a bit for me, Elliott.' - Take him away, boys. - Come on. Young Elliott must be in there telling his middle name. I wonder why the inspector wouldn't let us in? He's afraid we'll catch the real guy. Yeah. Any particulars from you, chief? Not now, boys. Carey'll give you all the dope at headquarters. Oh, Miss Pinkerton, don't look like that. Your face is a mile long. Remember, this all was a silver lining. I don't see one around this madhouse. Well, here's one. Mary has promised to cook us some late supper. I could use it. How about you? I've been hungry all my life for one thing or another. You mean.. I mean, right now, I'm hungry for...food. I'll have an ice cream soda for every time you've solved this crime. Oh, now. Please don't kid me. You know I'm having enough difficulty trying to be intelligent down at headquarters. Why can't we talk about something besides the case once in a while? Alright. Let's talk about you. You're coming to the movies with me, aren't you? - And me, so young. - Coffee, Miss. Yes. As you were saying. 'All we need is one tiny link to bind Elliott' 'with the murder of Miss Mitchell.' 'Or at least a sound motivation.' Then we can forget clues murders and confessions and go places and do things in the big way. Um, thanks. Uh, where's Hugo tonight, Mary? I made him go to bed, sir. I was afraid he'd have a collapse. He's so upset about Miss. Mitchell's death. - Cream, sir? - No thanks. Hugo was devoted to the old lady. There's a great deal he knows that he's not telling. [door opening] I'm going to investigate. [dog barking] What is it? Someone upstairs? [screaming] [screaming continues] Help! Help! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] - We got him, chief. - I'll be right down. - Are you hurt? - Uh, I'm getting used to it. You screamed loud enough to bring out the militia. If you think it's any fun having a Frankenstein leap at you every ten minutes you're badly mistaken. Look! Hmm, chloroform. He's coming out of it, alright. Now, listen. Miss Adams just about saved your life. I think you better tell us everything you know. I'll tell, alright. Listen. First get Miss Lenz. Get Florence Lenz and I'll, I'll tell everything. (Patten) 'This is your last chance. Understand?' It's no use. Lock me up. I don't care what you do. I don't know anything about it. Alright. Wait. Leave me alone with her. Maybe I can get something. Now, stop crying. Try to. There. I don't know anything about it. You do. You know this was an insurance swindle. That Wynn was to fake death and disappear. I don't know anything. Can't you see we're trying to help you? We know everything. Hugo talked. - Yes. And it involved you. - Hugo. He said, the man behind this case would marry you after Wynn disappeared. Hugo was to get a split. I don't know anything about it. How can we help you like this? Wynn made a mess of things when he married Paula. He couldn't go through with the suicide so he was murdered. - With his own gun. - Suppose he was. - It has nothing to do with me. - Only this. Next to go was Miss Mitchell. 'Cause she got the money. And name the killer in her will. You put the arsenic tablets in the tube on my tray. Like the murderer told you to do. It's not true. It's not true. I didn't know they were poisoned. Well, we can't stall around any longer. Come on. She's changed her mind. She'll talk. Good. Now we know Miss Mitchell was killed to make her will become effective. Your testimony is what we need to tie the two murders together. Are you willing to make the identification? Yes. - Did you want to see me? - Yes. Stand over there please. Is this the man? Now, look here. You said you're going to make the identification and you're going through it. Did anyone in this room give you tablets? Poison tablets. And tell to put them in that medical tube. Yes. Do you identify the prisoner as the man? - 'Yes.' - You rotten little liar. Don't you call me names you murderer. You made me one too. I thought those were sleeping powders not arsenic. - Keep your mouth shut. - Go on. This is good. Tell me one thing. Did Glenn manufacture the powder burn newspaper stunt for an alibi? Yes. Miss Mitchell found it and hid it so she'd get the insurance money. She didn't know it was a murder. - You're all crazy. - Oh, but you're not. You tried killing Hugo so that he wouldn't talk. Then the statement we witnessed was a fake. Yes. We signed a blank piece of paper folded over. Mr. Glenn wrote the fake statement later. He thought it would convict Elliot and stop further investigation. That's all boys. Take him downtown. She goes with him. Don't you worry. He'll help you. I know he will. - Thanks. - Thank you, doctor. - And that-- - Wraps that up. What about Charlie Elliott languishing in yon jailhouse? He'll be out before Miss Brent decides which dress she'll wear to their wedding. You're a great detective. I sometimes wonder how far you'll get if these wicked criminals didn't go around catching themselves. Come to think of it, you've arrested practically everyone in this cast except me. [telephone ringing] Oh, just as I'm getting a break. Oh. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Okay. Has Charlie Elliot confessed and started the whole thing again? No. A new case. At The Old Mills hotel at Caesar Lake. And they've assigned me to it. It's a swell double murder. Bodies found in the lake. Lots of clues. Wanna come along? Me? Not for all the tea in China. I'm going back to the hospital where it's peaceful and calm. I want a change. I got it and how. Oh, but this is a big case. I can smell it. You can smell for the both of us. No, wait a minute, please. There's something else-- [screaming] A mouse. [theme music]
