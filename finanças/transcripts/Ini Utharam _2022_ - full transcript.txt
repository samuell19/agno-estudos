(Indistinct chatter) Greetings. Welcome to Sark news. Kerala is No.1 in India's research related to law and order of the constitution. In the national agency's report of Indian Police foundation, Kerala Police has secured this praise worthy achievement. As the report was declared, President.. Hey, the opposition party has been silenced. They had a complaint saying that I had let loose all of you policemen. What happened now? In the Shanthanpara crayon factory strike that took place yesterday police lathi charged the mob. Many were injured. There's a public allegation that the public who conducted a peaceful strike were brutally beaten up by the police under the leadership of CI Karunan. But the police explanation says that they charged, since they were. pelted with stones. Shucks! This Karunan...! How ever hard I try to safeguard him in some way, he won't allow. If he restrains himself, after two years he can be the DySP. He has to be sensible for that. By the way to whom am I saying this to? How long has it been after your suspension? Huhâ€¦ about 5-6 months. Yeah 5-6 months! Who's it? -SK is on the line. Sit, that SP has come. Yeah ask him to come. Yes SK. I'm about to leave. The flight is at 9 o'clock. I'll reach there tomorrow. Yes we'll meet at the hotel. Hey don't say that on the call. It's a time when the walls here have eyes and ears! Sir, sorry Sir. I'll call you after reaching there. Sir, if it's something personal, I'll come later. Hey nothing, you come. Not that Sir. If we come to know other's secrets today, tomorrow we'll be his enemy. This is my grandfather's theory. Is it? -Yes Sir. Sir, did you ask me to come? What's the matter Sir? What's this man? Isn't Shanthanpara under your jurisdiction? -Yes Sir. There are no problems there, Sir. People didn't trust the new company. Eventually, the police have to stand against the public strike. Actually, the police hit back only for self defense. Yeah...ok. One second. Hello. Hey...come here. - Sir. Where is the pest controller? He is outside Sir. - Tell him to come immediately. He should be here soon! Rather than hitting the mosquito, you should hit him, Sir. With one hard blow on him, a single mosquito won't enter here. Do you know who he is? -Minister. Do you know the amount of workload he has, huh? For the people of this city to be in peace, while sitting, while sleeping.. .hell..while eating too he's thinking about it. And at that time, if mosquitoes bite him? Hey, if he is in peace, the people of the city will be in peace. Did you get me? Hereafter even if a mosquito enters here... it's over. He's understood it now. Better be careful. Leave now. Sir didn't you get me? These are your words. You said this at the Trivandrum Latix company strike. "We should hit back right on the target." "There is no point hitting elsewhere." "That would only hurt our hands." (Applause) "Long live the revolution!" At a tender age, I've also come with my father for the strike. Do you remember a person named Murugan who set himself ablaze for the party? Are you Murugan's son? - Yes Sir. Sir, when my father was alive, he used to talk highly about you with great pride. Sir, Muru.. It's time for the flight. - Hmm. So shall I leave? - Ok. Sir.. Oh... I forgot that. Hey, this Ayappan is our trusted aide. Don't get him into legal hassles. Make things favourable for him. This isn't a great deal, Sir. I'll take care of it, Sir. - Ok. Sir.. (Salutations to the party) (Salutations to the party) Salutations to People's party! (Salutations to the party) We'll meet and discuss in detail after I'm back. Take care of that Shanthanpara issue. Ok. - Don't aggravate it. Sir, go to America in ease. I'll take care of it. (Salutations continue) Salutations to Minister Dineshan! Salutations to Minister Dineshan! Salutations to People's party! (Indistinct chatter) Sir! Sir, the public is extremely violent. People have gathered in the ward and the surroundings. Not only that, there is harsh criticism and campaign against you in social media. Sir, you should be cautious. Due to lack of space, both the parties are admitted in the same ward. Where's that? - Here Sir. See, that Blackie Karunan has come. Correct time. -Will Tomy come today? Nothing to worry. We'll set it right. - Boss, Sir. Sir. - Hmm? Not here, it's there. (Indistinct chatter) I've been doing this crap, since the last 10-30 years. I know what to do. Did you get me? - Yes Sir. (Mocking laughter) You head to the station. I'll take care of the matters here. Sir! - Hmm. He's a Varma! I think he hasn't realised that kingship has changed. Come...come. You go and record their statement. Did you get enough? - No way. This is just simply gauzed. Your makeup is all fine! Then, I'll get you Scot-free. As soon as you're released, go into hiding. Do they doubt that you're from the party? Hey...not at all. Even if so, I have to get you Scot-free. Sir... we are also among the affected ones. Huh...I will be there. I am taking their statement. You better sit there. Anybody to get down here? Come on! Hurry up! Hey don't go away. There's one more person. Get in. Come one! Hurry up! Grandma, be careful! - ay. Let's go! Yes.. Ticket. Ticket. Grandma, where you heading to? To my son's house. Not that. You need the ticket to which place? Ticket to Pallipuram. -To Pallipuram? Ok sit there. There's a vacant seat. Go and sit. Yes there itself. Yes, sit there. Hold on tight. Did that Chechi in the front, take a ticket? Yeah. Ticket..ticket. (If your beloved comes in front of you within the next half an hour) (what will you do?) "Lonely." "Solitude everywhere." "Without you..." "I'm meaningless." (Applause) Thank you. Dedicated to the 5 years of our eventful relationship. Don't we have a bit of insanity? Only a bit? Not like that. Even without celebrating a birthday, will there be anyone celebrating the day they met? Isn't this birthday a social event? Mom, Dad, friends, everybody are entitled to have their rights in it. But this day when we met don't we only own this day? You know that amazing day when the Prince met his Princess. Hey, enough with this build up! Aren't we planting this tree just because we don't have money to buy a cake? It isn't like that Janu. After years when I forsake you, you can hang yourself on this tree instead of vexing the townsfolk, singing in my memory. That's the purpose of this tree. - Is it? Did you get me? Walk ahead. -Hey Janu.. "In the grandeur of your love, my heart sings a song" "In the thought of your companionship, my life is fulfilled." "You are all over in my memories," "Like the luminescence of the skies." "Within deep within." "Who, who are we?" "Are we tales woven by the obscure?" "Treasure, oh treasure!" "The time when you come beside to fade in me." "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Words that are encompassing me." "I'm in search of words in return." "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Symphony that's encompassing me." "You are that symphony!" Here. - Huh. There's a SIM with this. Now, stop messaging me from other's phone. A smartphone? -Hmm. I'll lose all my peace Janu. Why simply? Yeah right, as if all smartphone users have lost their peace. See, actually this isn't for you. This is for me to call, when I feel like seeing you. Understood? - Hmm! "Seeking for happiness," "You're my life's contentment." "To tread faraway distances," "To share all the sorrows" "The time when you come beside to fade in me." Mom, I've taken the plates. - Ok son. He's just a duffer, exactly! Dad, isn't it time to stop? Here, I've stopped. Uncle, plate. You're off your drinking limits today, Uncle. I am a free bird now. My daughter's all grown up. And she's capable to stand on her own feet now. I don't have a wife, responsibilities or any nonsense. So what's the problem if I have few extra drinks? No problem. Here. - That's enough dear. Now I have just one dream. A journey forsaking everything. Oh I see! What much do you have to forsake? The credit you have at the bar? Have some more! "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Words encompassing me," "I'm in search of words in return." "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Ashwin will leave after dropping me." "Hey, aren't you there for the wedding?" Of course. - Anyways, I'll call you before that. Bye! - Bye. Ok then, bye. - Bye I'll see you for Renu's marriage. See, partaking like this always isn't enough. Get married soon. We also need a treat. I'll give you a treat if you want. But we can't get married for that. We'll leave? - Ok then. Come, let's go. Ok bro. - Bye man. Shall we get married too? Get lost! Hey! Hey you! Hey! Hey, Ashwin! Check this out. Isn't it nice? - Hmm. Hey! You keep on flirting here! Someone stole your bike away. Oops..! My bike? Look at his reaction, even when someone has stolen his own bike. You be careful girl. Even if someone steals you, he would have the same amount of grief. "Like the unceasing blue rains.." "Magical rays of sunlight." "All seasons along with you," "The heart offering rhythms." "Oh beauty, when you come beside me." "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Words that are encompassing me." "I'm in search of words in return." "Slowly, slowly gaze at me." "Look into my eyes with your soul." "Symphony that's encompassing me." "You are that symphony." You said you won't give this number to anyone? This should be Vivek or my mother. Who else will call me? - I hope it ain't any girl's call. See, it's Vivek. Hello? - Hey... You took the bike from the station and left right away. Couldn't you see the CI and thank him? He asked me about you. I've sent you his number. - Hmm. You just call him. Oh ok. I have to thank that CI for finding our bike. Why should I thank him when he was just doing his duty? Hmm. - It must be for some bribe. Hey, Renu's marriage is on Sunday. Shall we go tomorrow? Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Friday right? I can't go tomorrow. Just tell me straight if you can't take me there. Not like that, you dumb girl! I have to give the vehicle for servicing tomorrow. Hmm, isn't the wedding on Sunday? We'll go on Saturday morning. Then, from there, we can go straight to Mysore. Ok? - Hmm Ok? Stop! Chetta, Shanthanpara? - Yeah, this is Shanthanpara. I have to get down. There's a person to get down. Stop the bus. Ah, Shanthampara. Get down. Ah, get down! Be quick! Get down fast, sister. Ok, let's go! (JANAMAITHRI POLICE STATION, SHANTHANPARA) How long has it been since you removed that CCTV from here? If you don't come today also, CI has told us to scoop you. If you come, it's good for you. Hey, have you changed the silencer? Yes Sir. I came to show it. Be relaxed. I'm there here. There is no issue. No issue will arise. I'll take care. One minute, I'll call you back. What's happening, Member? That ASI says that the CI isn't complying. He will trap Suresh. He did that for everyone. He shouldn't face it all alone. Then you go, come on go. Why, aren't you going? You will shit your pants with the bashing. Let me tell all of you something. The issue is with the police. But instigated by him. Hope you know it. I am trying to solve this. If you try to act smart, I'll back off. See, it's the District President, move. Didn't you hear him? Yes Muralietta. Did you talk? - I did talk. Get him out of this. In this matter the party favours the factory. Hope you know? CI is not here. When he comes, I'll talk again. (Indistinct chatter) If you harass your wife anymore, I'll stab you through the spleen. Did you get me? If anything happens, just come here. Ok Sir. - Take her home. Yes this one too. - Is it these two? Yes Sir. Here Sir. Is CI Sir here? Sir has gone out. Tell me. When will CI Sir be back? How can I say that dear? He has gone for an enquiry. All those people standing there, have come to meet Sir. Tell me the matter. I killed a man Sir. Huh..!! Hello, a girl has come here. She's saying that she has killed someone. What's it? What's the problem? She says she has killed someone. Can you give me some water, Sir? What's it Madam? Is there any problem? No problem Sir. What actually happened? Please tell me what happened? Sir..? -I am the SI. Isn't CI Sir the in charge of the station? Let him come. I'll tell him. That's great! So, is only the CI needed in the station? What are the other policemen for? Madam. We are here to enquire the matters and write down statements. If you're not comfortable to tell me, I'll call the lady constable. Sir, do I seem to be a coward to you? If I have the courage to come here and say that I killed someone... ...then I can say it to anyone. But in my present mental status I can't tell this to everybody. Let CI Sir come. I'll tell him. Sir, just a minute. My dear Sir, I think this case is an off the hook one. Did you observe the medicines that lady ate? They are medicines taken by those with mental disorders. Yes Sir, I purchase them for my mother. Shucks! This will be a big headache. -Hmm. You do one thing. -Hmm. Call the CI and inform him. - Ok Sir. Sir Zatta 1-7 is done. Hello. Sir, I had to give you an intimation. What's it? A lady has come to the station saying that she has killed someone. Did she say she killed? Whom? She didn't say that. She says that she will only tell it to you. I'll come there now. -Ok Sir. Tiger P1-8 answering Sir. Good morning Sir. Sir, yesterday 4 cases have been reported in the station. The first case has been registered under the section 323, 326 and 34 IPC. The defendants who aimed to physically harass the complainant were in rancour as the complainant filed a C.M.P. in court. This ensued to the physical harassment of the complainant. This is the case Sir. Sir! Who's the person? - There she is. Bring her inside. - Sir. Come. Tell me. What's the matter? Sir, why is it like this? Like what? Isn't this a Janamaithri police station? Shouldn't you at least offer a seat to those who come to the station? Oh... that's the matter. Sit. Now tell me. I killed a man, Sir. Ayo..! That's all?! Madam is not an ordinary lady. She asked me a chair to sit after murdering a person. You are indeed a smart lady! Why is it like that Sir? Which law states that convicts shouldn't be allowed to get human rights? Shut up you..! You're speaking about rights after slaughtering someone? I have been wearing this since long. Don't teach me the courtesy I have to give a killer. Did you get me? Then Janamaithri.... ..that's only on the board outside. This is my station. I decide what should happen here. Did you hear me? But there is a difference here Sir. This is not a case where you enquired and found the convict. I have complete faith in the law and order here and I wish to protect and preserve it. This is a case where I have come on my own to confess my crime. This is a different one, Sir. Last June 16th, on a Friday.. ...I killed an anti-socialist who incessantly troubled me... ..and buried him in a forest. Forest? Which forest? In Pooppara. Near the 2nd mile, Sir. Everything happened in an impulse. Whom did you kill? His name is Vivek. He was a womanizer. He was once my friend. Hey stop it! Doing wantonness in a public place. Oh Vivek...I got scared. Yes, you should get scared. This is why moral policing exists? Seeing such lovey- dovey stuff, anyone will be jealous. Even I felt like getting one.. Hey I'll give you one. -Why not? Who told you to come here now? - Sheesh! Give my bag. - Get lost. But after I got into a relationship with Ashwin... ..there were lots of changes in Vivek's behaviour. During some journey together.. ..he clicked my bathroom photos. ..and started threatening me. When his harassment was unbearable.. ..I took him to the forest in the pretext of a tent meet. I killed and buried him. Anyway who is he to interfere in my life? Isn't it Sir? Then why are you making this confession now? -Because what I did was wrong. No citizen has the right to take law into their own hands. Isn't it right? Sir...Sir. Sir. - What's it man? Come here. She has some mental disorder. I saw her taking medicines for mental illness. No wonder! So you do one thing. Give your accurate address and other details to this officer. Hey, write down everything clearly. - Sir. We'll look into it. You may go now. Couldn't you send her off previously? Such nuisances! Sir, are you avoiding me? Sir even if you believe it or not, this belongs to the man I killed. Just enquire. I don't think that it was just a mere statement, Sir. There is some truth in what she says. I will see to it. You may go. Sir! Who are doing the rounds? Shabil and Joby, Sir. Give this to them and tell them to enquire. Sir. Sir stop the bike. There's a call coming. 1-8 Romeo P 1-8 calling. P 1-8 1-8 Romeo answering Sir. Shabil I've sent an address to your WhatsApp. Just check it. This is nearby, Sir. Sir this is nearby. Search for him immediately and report it. It's a missing case. It's clear Sir, over. Sir, is it true? What's wrong with you Raja? It's just some lunatic's case. (Indistinct chatter) Sir..sir what has happened? What happened? What happened Sir? (Reporters questioning) Get down. All of you get down. Sir, it's packed with media people outside. Media people? (Reporters questioning) Tell us Sir. - Hey move aside. What has happened Sir? Who has been killed? What is the matter? We have come here on the basis of some clear evidences. Why did that girl commit a murder? Who has been killed? Is it a rape case, Sir? What nonsense are you talking about? A girl has come here saying that she killed someone. That doesn't mean that the police can impulsively go for collection of evidences. The killer has confessed it in person, then why are you delaying the enquiry? Who delayed it? - You said you can't enquire. Who said we can't? I meant that the police have certain legal procedures. First we have to inspect if something has happened... ...to the man she claims to have killed. After that we have to confirm if there is any connection between them? After that, a case is registered and statement is taken. Did you get me? Then there is an important thing. We have a small doubt regarding the mental stability of this girl. Sir, what did you say? I asked what did you say? In front of all these media, on what basis did you call me a lunatic? Madam I saw you eating a medicine. Isn't it taken by mental patients? Is it this..huh? When did Lisinopril meant for high BP, become a mental illness tablet for you? Didn't you call me a lunatic in front of so many people? Do you know who I am? I am a Doctor. -Dr.Janaki Ganesh. You can imagine the mental condition of a person who has come to confess her crime. My blood pressure shot up. It's true. I committed a crime. I have come prepared to face any punishment regimented by the... ...Indian Penal Code But since I've come here.. ...this officer is behaving with a preconceptual mind to me. Even when I said I killed a man.. ..and even when I am willing to show the place where I buried him.. ..till now this officer is not ready to inspect. You should understand this. Madam whom did you kill? Madam why did you kill? I have already told everything to the police. I can't afford to say it again...please. Madam..madam just a minute. Please..please Madam. Please say. 18 Bravo answering. Sir, I went to that boy's house and enquired. He left home a week ago saying that he's going to the farm house. When we enquired at the farm house, we came to know that a girl came to take him with her. The car in which that girl came is still there. The car is registered under someone named Janaki. Anyway, the boy's phone is switched off even now. Sir, I think the missing is confirmed. Didn't I tell you Sir, that I killed him? Hey, start the vehicle. Sir..Sir..please Sir. Yes hello. No..no..I'm on the way to the location. Let me just reach there and see what happened? I will let you know after that. I said I'll let you know after reaching there. Huh...where are they all heading to? Hey..Shaju. What's this? Is it some fire break out? They aren't the ones who extinguish the fire. They ignite it. Hold this, I'll be right back. Shajuetta, there are Khakhi clad officers in the jeep. Wait, I'm also coming. -Yes, get on. Yes keep a watch on her. It's a difficult task in this forest. Where's it? There Sir. Keep the people away, behind..behind. If that girl is saying a lie.. Will someone say simply? Isn't she a doctor? - That's for sure. That's right. (Indistinct chatter) Chetta..chetta, what's the matter? Is it a marijuana case? That would have been better. The girl who is going there has killed and buried someone there. Killed? Hey come. (Indistinct chatter) No idea, what's the matter. (Indistinct chatter) She is not from the police. She is not from the police. By the time we reached here, he realised something was fishy. He tried to run. Hey come here. Why are you waiting there? Come here. It's somewhere here. I think they got some evidence. (Indistinct chatter) I think it's a spectacle. (Indistinct chattter) That's belongs to him Sir. Then? Then we killed and buried him. We? Didn't you say that you were alone? No Sir. I can't kill a man alone, Sir. There was one more person with me. Who's that? That... Come on say, who's that? That man is this CI Sir. You bitch! Talking shit. Sir..Sir..please. - What do you think of yourself? Sir move away. -Leave me man. Listen to me Sir. Hey are you playing a fool with the police, huh? I'm fed up Sir. It's been 4 days since I slept. Whenever I close my eyes it reminds me of his piercing eyes. You! - I am fed up. If you talk nonsense, I'll pull out your tongue. Whatever you say, can you change my call history, Sir? At 8.45 pm, didn't you tell me the way to bring him here? Hey leave me.You! I'll see that you..hey leave me. You don't know who I am. Hello.. Move away. Hey that blackie Karunan is trapped. It seems he has killed a man and buried him at Pooppara. A girl has come here to show the spot. Hey, there's a lot of chaos here. You come here fast with all our buddies. Let us also see. Yes man, that blackie Karunan has killed someone. (Indistinct chatter) Leave me. -Sir no..no..please You asshole! Whom did I kill? Tell me. Get lost! -Leave him Sir. What are you doing Sir? Get away Sir. Why did you hit him? Listen to me. Stay still. Hey leave me. Are you going to gather all the townsfolk, huh? Please come Sir...come. You must come Sir. Keep him away. You call man. Didn't you hit me? I'll teach you a lesson, you scoundrel. Leave it. - Leave me. Bashe.. What happened? That blackie Karunan hit Rinto at Annathoppil. Come..come..get in. Get in. Get in fast. Start the vehicle. Come..come on walk. She doesn't know my true self. She is playing childish with the police. Why are you holding my hand? Just leave me! Sir, I have nothing against you, but these townsfolk have. Sir if they create any ruckus, we only have 4-5 police men to charge back. You should understand that Sir, please. Keep them away. -Move behind. Remain behind. Just keep calm. Wait, wait there. Hey start the vehicle. (Indistinct chatter) Get aside. Don't push. Move aside. Go back. What's happening? Get away. - Keep quiet. Get back. Hey set them aside. Hold them away. Get away. Where are you heading to, Sir? After killing a man and showing heroism by slapping our boy and the girl who revealed it where are you heading to Sir? For God's sake don't create an issue. Please move away. Rajan just explain it to them. - That I... Sir, Member won't say anything in this regard. He knows it why. Sir, we haven't come to create an issue. But if you take him from here now, we know very well there'll be no sign of evidences. We also eat the same rice like you. You shouldn't obstruct the investigation. If so legal action will be taken against you all. Leave that Sir. We also know a bit about legal actions. Hasnâ€™t the CI buried the body here? So shouldn't the investigation happen here? The investigating officers will come here to investigate. Rinto, call our people. Hmm. Come on man. Move behind. I told you wait. Anish. -Sir. Move aside. Move a bit. Just give some way. Hey move away. Don't push. Just move away. Just get aside. Get back. Just move Move aside.Get back. What's this man? Don't push forward. Hello Sir. -Yes. Sir I am Prashanth Varma, the SI of Shanthanpara police station. Tell me Prashanth. Didn't a girl named Janaki come to the station saying that she has killed someone? -Yes. Sir, according to what she said, we came with here to Annathoppil where she claims to have buried the body. Sir, she also showed us the pit, but what she is saying now.. ...is that CI Karunan is also involved in that murder. What?! All the townsfolk have surrounded and blocked the CI. Many more townsfolk are also coming collectively after hearing this. Sir, not only that, the media is also there. What the hell! Prashanth hold on. - Sir. SP is calling. Good morning Sir. - Good morning. What is happening in Pooppara? They're showing it all in the news. Now that lady is saying, that CI Karunan is her accomplice in the murder she did. SI Prashanth is there from the spot. I'll connect you to him. Prashanth, SP Sir is on the line. Good morning Sir. Not at all Prashanth. What is the condition now? Sir, things are a bit complicated. The townsfolk are against the police after the lathi charge yesterday. If the people suddenly turn violent, then I will be helpless. So some senior officials should come here immediately. We require additional force too. Ok, Prashanth listen. Hide CI away from the public. And don't provoke them. Got it? - Sir. Raj, are you listening? - Yes Sir. We need backup. Inform the forest department and RDO for digging immediately. Sure Sir. Prashanth we'll be there in few minutes. Thank you Sir. - Ok. Sir! Since the investigative officer stands accused.. ..senior officials including the SP have left for the spot. As soon as they reach the spot where the body was buried... Look, there are cops at Shanthanpara. (News continues) Oh no, isn't this Janaki? (Indistinct voices) Hey Rajeev, what's going on? That girl is saying that CI was with her. Blackie will be trapped in this. - Did they get the body? They haven't started digging. Member has also come. Hope Blackie gets fired. - That will surely happen. (Indistinct voices) (Crowd booing) (Crowd mocking the CI) Raja. - Yes Sir. What's it Sir? If I was a police officer I would have beaten that blackie to a pulp and forced him to dig the pit. Understood? Member...! Raja, we need two people to dig the pit. Why not Sir. I'll get it done just now. Move away. - Can't you listen? Get away to the sides. Sir don't dare to touch us. We got enough the previous day. We'll retaliate today. - Hey. Hey move away. Distance them away maximum. None of you should dare to move. We told you not to move ahead, to keep the evidences intact. And if you all budge forward and we miss on something... ...I'll file a case and put you all behind bars. Bunch of rogues! Now who wants to get in? Do you want to? Do you want to... huh? Do you want to? Don't threaten us Sir. We haven't come to destroy the evidence. We will leave. Then Sir you need not rack up your brain to file a case. We are not the accused that girl has mentioned, but it's your CI. Hey..you..! Morning Sir. - Hmm. Good morning Sir. -Hmm. We've come here, instructed by the Munnar DFO. I am the Devikulam Range Officer. Do you have any formalities? No Sir. We have nothing to do since it is a murder. We can charge an additional case, if they have entered the forest with weapons. That's all. Which way? - This way Sir? Sir. (Media questioning) Wait, wait, wait! Please... please, please. Let me just check. Sir. - Yes Prashanth. His way Sir. - Please tell them to clear the crowd. Get away. Move aside. Don't push. Move aside. Clear them, clear. Move aside. (Crowd noises) I told you to move aside. Stay behind, stay behind! Didn't I tell to clear the site? Don't disturb us. Clear out. Hey, tell them to stand away. Go back...back. Let us do our work. Get away man! Get down, Take the tools.' - Hmm. Get down. Put the stand. -Hmm. What's this? Won't this shift into neutral gear? Hey... do you have the documents of this vehicle? That's great! I've come to dig out the corpse. Will I carry my undies along? Buzz off Sir! Untie it. Don't push. Sir. - Hmm. Prashanth. - Sir. Didn't you switch on the AC when he was sitting in the jeep? Isn't he your superior? Sorry Sir. What's happening Sir? Will the crow (blackie) be trapped? Huh..? 'Crow?' Huh..?! Can't you understand? Move aside. When a girl says something, the whole world will believe in her blindly. Isn't it right, Karunan? Yes Sir. Hey..hey don't push. What's your name? Janaki. (Crowd noises) Did you bury it here itself? Yes Sir. Move... move away. So let's dig and see. Let's dig it. Hey move aside. If you don't want to get killed with a hoe, move aside. Greetings! So did you have your food? - Hmm. Only after all this is over, can we have our food. Hail the Swamy! - Hail Lord Ayappan! Be a bit careful. Slowly. (Indistinct shouts) Hey, get aside. (Chaos continues) Just leave us. Dear... Dear. Dear... Janaki. Dear... Dear. Hey be careful. Do it with care. Sir..! Hey, there's a body. (Chaos continues) (Chaos continues) (Chaos continues) Sir. I think he is there in our missing records. Confirm whether it's the same person. Sir. Hello Shanthanpara police station- Mahesh, this is Prashanth. - Yes Sir. A pastor's missing case has been registered today in Thiruvananthapuram, right? Is it the Kattakkada police station? Yes, the same one. Do me a favour. Send me those photos and details through WhatsApp immediately. Ok Sir. Sir, there is one more. Yes pick it. Pick it up. They said there was one, now it's two. That's our boy. Ayo! Isn't this our Ashwin? Hey move aside. My child. Open. Sir..sir... - My God! Please... Please. Get back. - My son. Our son. Move away Sir. Hold her. Move Sir. Our son. Stay away from the way. Son..! (Chaos intensifies) Didn't you slap our boy? Blackie you are trapped! You are trapped! This time you can't be emancipated. Don't stand simply. Arrest him Sir. Do you think we folks are dumbheads? There's an unexpected twist in the Pooppara murder case. In the inspection that took place in the presence of senior officials the police have found two dead bodies instead of one. Both the bodies have been identified. But the surprising fact is that from the burial place... ..the police have now found CI Karunan's smart watch. The police havenâ€™t been able to find Vivek's body as yet claimed to be killed by the girl. The girl was shifted to the hospital, since she fell unconscious before she could reveal further details. What's your reaction in this situation where the investigative officer... ...himself is the alleged convict? He is a liar. He will do it. We know it, Sir. Last day, during the hunger strike against the chemical factory this CI accepted bribe from the company and bashed everyone with other cops. Today morning when he came to record the statement this sly son of a bitch, didn't even bother to look towards the public. He has connection with bigwigs, Sir. Or else, why aren't the police arresting him even after getting so many evidences? Isn't the law equal for all, Sir? Police bring about justice! Police bring about justice! Arrest him. (Protests continue) Arrest the murderer! (Protests continue) (Protests continue) Don't create a ruckus. Stop making noise. Move aside. All of you keep calm. Keep them aside. Enough.. enough. Silence! Sir... Sir. The people seem to be very violent. I know. We have to leave from here at the earliest. Make preparations for the same. Raj. - Sir. Keep the force ready. - Yes Sir. But that is only for safety. - Yes Sir. Whatever happens the public shouldn't get even a single blow. -Yes Sir. -Did you get me?-Sir. The press and media have surrounded us. For God's sake, don't distort the good things the President told. I will speak to the crowd. - Ok Sir. Sir, don't go Sir. The people are in collective bunches. Don't create a ruckus. Prashanth. Always a collective bunch never has brains. Whoever thinks alone has brains. (Protests continue) Don't make noise. There is no use of making noise. Please calm down! I told you to keep calm! Calm down! (Protests continue) Didn't I ask you to calm down? I've come here to speak to you. Please listen to me! Haven't I come to talk to you? No mistakes have been committed here. Who is he, that so many policemen have come to protect him? -Minister? Some mistake was committed in the chemical factory's issue. I know that. But, there is no connection between both these incidents. Did you get me? Just because one of us committed a mistake... ..doesn't mean you can consider all of us wrong. Whoever has committed a crime will surely be punished. I have come here for that. Understood? I pray to the Almighty daily. So will a person like me... ..lie to you people wearing this? Huh? You come here. Didn't you say that CI Karunan received bribe from them? Did you say it with some proof, or simply said it? There is no evidence Sir, but he will do it. I am sure of that. Oh I see. Brother.. You have a great skill in mobilizing people. So why don't you try your luck in some political party? But don't show off that skill to me. Because I am a genius in silencing the crowd. Suresh you are very good boy. Don't trust everyone in the same way. But some of the ruffians out there would lie even after wearing the sacred chain. Sir, it's finished. Do the procedures. - Sir. Clear the body. Send Ashwin's body for postmortem and Prakash's to the mortuary. - Sir. What's happening? Did his wife leave? She has left Sir. There is a 6 hour journey. She will be here by night. Sir, the body that lady had mentioned? Where will we search in such a big forest? Let her come back. You take care of the matters regarding that postmortem. Sir. - And after that boy's parents are calm, we have to take their statement. Ok Sir. - Ok? Prashanth. Take CI Karunan's phone from him. Sir. The primary inference is that both the murders are due to forceful strangulation around the neck. Those marks are visible on the neck. The young man was beaten up before being killed. Marks on his shirt and elsewhere suggest of being stamped with shoes smeared with oil. The marks suggest that it's a shoe with a size 9. Not only that there is a damage in the killer's left shoe sole. Ok. I'll take care. You can leave. Thank you. Tell me Prashanth. What about the jeep we gave for servicing? It has a lot of repair, Sir. They said it might take 3 more days. Didn't you tell him that this station has only 2 jeeps? I said Sir. - Hmm. Dhanesh, what happened? What to say Sir. I went to drop CI Sir to his home. Since there was no heat shield, the shoe melted and got stuck. I was lucky enough not to hear bad words. Yes Sir. Sir Karunan had called me. Since I was in an urgent meeting, I couldn't pick up the call. I came to know everything just now. What's the situation? Sir it's not a big issue. Since that girl said everything in front of the media, there's a hype. That's all. I couldn't connect to the Minister, since he is traveling. Hope you know it. Karunan is Sir's trusted aide. Just manage the matters carefully, Sir. Sir, what's this Sir? Do you have to tell me this? I'll take care Sir. Hmm. Thank you. Prashanth. - Sir. He should not attend any phone calls. No communication with anyone or media. Yes Sir. Since the victim is a policeman, matters can be manipulated. Clear Sir. - Ok! You both come with me. Oh no... Mom! Mom! Prashanth. There is a child. Be careful. - Sir. We should not be a disturbance for him. - Sure sir. Why did you run with fear? What is your name, son? Madam, I'm the SP from Idukki. Hold this bag. There is nothing here Sir. -Hmm. Hello, what about that lady? All the media is saying that CI is the accused. Sir the media will only report the news. We have to confirm whether it's true or false. Any evidence? Actually I've got some evidences Sir... but... ..it could be manipulated. Not only that Sir... ..he has many enemies. Anyways.. ..close the case at the earliest. And..make a good news for Kerala Police. Ok Sir, Thank you. Just a minute. Hold on. Sir, it's Mahesh from the hospital. He said that Janaki will be discharged soon. That's good. Prashanth tell them to bring that girl and Karunan to the police club. Sir Hello Mahesh. Her pressure shot up due to lack of sleep and tension. She has taken medicines. No problem. You can take her. -Ok Doctor. Let's go? Greetings! Coming back to the current news update. Literate Kerala is left in shock! This day is a matter of shame for the Kerala Police. In the Pooppara murder case, Shanthanpara CI is also in the list of accused. Earlier too, even if the girl accused his involvement in the murder ..after getting his smart watch along with the body ...the police have added him to the list of accused. After gathering the evidences from the spot.. ..both of them are being brought to Idukki Police club for detailed questioning. To the live streaming. (Indistinct chaos) Come. (Media questioning) Move..move. Sir what do you have to say? Any crucial evidences, Madam? Please co-operate. Give way. Sir. -Hey move away. - Sir...Sir..Sir. Sir why is the CI's arrest being delayed? Careful! Don't push. Please understand that he is a policeman. He knows the law. And... ..without a proper evidence we cannot arrest him. Sir, so are you saying that CI's smart watch got along with the body... isn't a strong evidence? No..no, not like that. See.. ..the reason for this murder is not yet clear. And that will be clarified only when we do a detailed questioning. So is the delay in his arrest, an attempt to save the CI? Only by delaying, how can he be saved? See.. everybody is equal in front of the law. And just because he is a policeman he is not going to get any preference. Not only that.. ..he has been suspended as part of the investigation. Sir, so can we expect an arrest after the questioning? If he is found guilty. Sir... Sir. - That's it. Sir..sir..one more question please. The visuals now show that the accused CI and the lady have been.. brought to the Idukki Police club for questioning. Since a policeman is the accused.. ..the SP explained that the police are moving very cautiously. The latest update is that there will be an arrest after a detailed questioning. Sir. Sir, we have recorded the statement of that boy's parents. That girl and the deceased boy were in a live-in relationship. They don't know if there was any dispute between the two. Sir, I have verified the phone details of CI Sir. What that lady said is true. According to the phone data this lady has called CI Sir at 8.45 pm on 16th. They spoke for approximately 12 seconds. Not only that both these phones were under the same tower location. The deceased pastor called CI Sir about 7 times the previous day and... ..on the day the incident happened. Even the pastor's last call was to CI Sir. Not only that.. ...Vivek's phone whom Janaki claims to have killed was also switched off at this place. Prashanth. Is there.. ...any chance? Sir..?! Isn't he one among us? Don't you feel like protecting him? No problem Prashanth, you may go. I'll take care. Sir. Sir, you can change your uniform. Santosh, give me that phone. My dear Sir, don't put me in trouble. I have 3 small kids and a housing loan of 2.5 millions. I'll lose my job. I won't give it Sir. Mom, when will you come? -It's because I'm busy at work. You go to sleep dear. I'll come in the morning. Bring Oreo biscuit when you come. Yes I will bring. Kisses! -Kisses! If we have no one to wait for us.. ....then what is the purpose of this life? Isn't it Sir? Can you.. ..can you a play a song for me? Why is the song playing? Huh? Nothing like that Sir. When Madam asked... What did she say? If this habit continues, you will finally open the door and let her free. Isn't it? Sir.. You may go. - Sir. Sir, why are you intimidating her? Don't you know very well I haven't come to go out from here? If it was to go out, would anyone come inside saying that I killed someone? But you haven't come to go behind bars. Instead to put someone behind bars. Or else you say. An Ortho surgeon from a famous hospital in Ernakulam comes to a police station in the midst of the forest.. ... saying that she killed someone. What's the reason for that Janaki? Say the truth. Where is Vivek? Didn't I tell you Sir? We killed him. And buried him. Both of you together? -No. CI Sir killed him. So... ..why did you first say that you killed him? It was my need. I was the one who forced him. Oh..! The punishment for abetment charges is less. Isn't it? Sir, that is the flaw of our law. Actually the one who inspires to commit a crime should be punished first. We will talk about the punishment later. Now you say this. Why should CI commit a murder for you? I am not the one who should say that Sir. Isn't it he who should say? Sir you ask him. He will tell you. So then.. ..where is that body? It is in that forest itself. But I will not say where it is. There was an understanding between the two of us before killing Vivek. But CI Sir erred it. Now everything will come to light. -What understanding? I won't say. I won't breach the trust. You pointed out your co- accused in front of the media and you say you won't breach the trust? That's great! Sir, this is not breach of trust. It's a means for escape. You will understand that soon, Sir. So... Janaki, you better understand this. Your allegation is against a CI on service. I know that Sir. He will resort to any means to safeguard his name. I have no fear. The whole police force will be with him. A collective bunch has no brains, Sir. Only the one who thinks alone has brains. Hmm!! Janaki. Evidences will speak in the court and not the truth. In certain places evidences should speak louder than the truth. I am also waiting only for that. Switch it on and wait outside. -Sir. I want to close this case without causing any disgrace to the police department. Karunan if you cooperate we can close it soon. So you don't tell me that you didn't go there, didn't wait there. There are evidences. Tell me what happened. See... ..I can help you. It is true that I had gone there Sir. that was not to kill anyone. Then? One day when I was having my lunch in the canteen.. ..I got a call. Hello. One minute. That was a call from an informer saying that there was the presence of Maoists.. ..in the hills and that he would give me their details. Because I got an information that there would be problem in the hunger strike tent.. ..I send 5 policemen for duty there... ..and I took the jeep.. ..and went to meet that informer. I was told to go straight to Pooppara. I went there and waited a long time for him. Suddenly I heard some noise from inside the forest. I looked all over there to know what that noise was. But.. ..even after searching a lot, when I couldn't see anything I came back. That is when I realised that my watch was missing. Then I entered the forest and searched a bit. After sometime I directly went home, Sir. Did you go that day by jeep? -Yes Sir. Later... ..you went home, correct? Yes, right. So, who was that deceased pastor? Why did he call you so many times, Karunan? Why did he call you? Sir he was my informer. They might have killed him after knowing that the information has leaked. You went, waited there and came back. Whatever you said is all correct. The mobile tower location shows the same thing. But there is one problem Karuna. You didn't go there by jeep. -But by some other vehicle. Because that day there was only one jeep at the station. The other one was at the workshop. Santosh. - Sir. -Hmm. Your story has gone a bit off track, Karuna. Karuna I know that you have done this. If I have to save you.. ..you should tell me the matter. I will frame the story. "You womanizer leader..." An election that took place 15 years ago. "resign. Go out" The People's party had decided Palliyil Ganeshan as the MLA candidate. "Resign" But Varkala Dineshan who had an eye on that seat fabricated a sexual allegation against Ganeshan and strategized for that seat. "Resign" - Take the vehicle, take the vehicle. Hey, get aside. (Indistinct chaos) Whatever you say now our candidate is.. Don't make noise, don't make noise. We have gathered here to arrive at a decision. Try to understand. We won't support. The allegation... Please cooperate. Isn't this a meeting? Please restrain yourselves. They won't stop Sir, please tell them our decision. Stop it! I said stop it! We shall stand with the opinion of the majority. Since the members and the people are present together this time the party has decided that let Ganeshan be the candidate. (Applause) In spite of fabricating a sexual allegation when Ganeshan was made the candidate that dampened the spirits of Dineshan Sir. In spite of us making a sexual scandal we failed to drag him down. And now if he wins too, then it's over. We.. -We have been screwed! You said you would take charge of everything and so.. ...for you I took millions..millions.. from different people. Give that to me. Now when they ask, what answer will I give? Then, let me say one thing now itself. If Ganeshan becomes the candidate, I will change sides. At that time, don't say that SK is a scoundrel. SK Sir, only the party has decided it as yet, right? There is still time for the election. I will take care. We chalked out a plan using Dineshan Sir's servant cum driver. Yes Sir. - Where are you? I'm at the spot. Is everything ok? Everything is ok , Sir. (Screams) Hey.. Hey you..! Hey.. Stop the vehicle. He is the man Sir. Thank you doctor. Did you see that man properly? - I saw Sir. It was a truck with a Thiruvananthapuram registration number. I don't remember the number. But he rammed into them and went away without stopping. I saw it and called out to him loudly. That time I saw him turning and looking back. Hmm. So if you see that man again you can recognise him, right? I can Sir. I saw him clearly. What is your name? What's it? -Sir. There's a small problem. -Hmm? The boy who showed a black flag to Ganeshan, says that he saw everything. What should we do now, Sir? Then concort both the incidents as one. You are cooking up stories after hitting and killing them with your vehicle? I haven't done anything like that Sir. Since his father was sick.. ...that poor boy had gone with his jeep to take the load. We framed a murder case against him and for the time being we washed our hands off. But.. ..the issue didn't end there. What's it Mom? Our child has gone, my dear. My God! After the death of his child who was born after a long wait of 11 years.. ..he became sleepless. The thought that his child died as a result of the sin he committed... ..started hounding him. My child..! My God..! "Have you become sleepless due to the sins you've committed?" "Is it ruling your brain?" "Has it incapacitated you?" "You come unto me." "You come unto me." "Hallelujah!" (Praise be to God) "All the plans of the devil... ..may be perished in the name of God." "Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!" "You are God's loved one." "Let your repentance be forgiven in the name of God." "Hallelujah, Hallelujah!" "You may repent." "If you confess your sins, your heavenly Lord.. ..the merciful Lord, will forgive your sins." "Hallelujah!" "Call out to the Lord loudly. Hallelujah!" "Crack your throat and pray aloud" "Hallelujah!" "You've already reached God's abode." "Say it out loudly, loudly" "Hallelujah, Hallelujah!" "Say it out loudly, Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord!" "Say it out loudly, loudly" Long periods of prayer transformed him into a pastor. When we assumed that everything was over.. ...an incident took place. Oh God! My Jesus! (Slurry voice) He became sleepless again after seeing the condition of that family that was shattered due to him. In the end when he could no longer hold on.. ...he called me. Hello.. - Sir, I am Prakashan. He called me that day, to say that he was going to confess all his sins. I tried a lot to make him back off. But he did not concede. At last I told him that I wanted to see him. I took a vehicle from the yard, fixing certain things in mind... ...I took him to Pooppara. Come, get in. Sir. Sir, where are we heading to? -Just close by to the other side. This is a short cut. Why did you stop here, Sir? You get down. Here? What's this Prakasha? What all are you saying, huh? Hey, have you gone mad? -If I continue like this, I will go mad, Sir. Do you know, it's been long since I've slept peacefully. When I close my eyes I can see that family agonizing because of me. Do you know that? My God..! -Prakasha. Aren't you a believer of God? Does anything happen here without God's knowledge? So, why don't you believe this too as God's destiny? Prakasha.. ...just think for a while. 10-15 years ago those incidents just happened. The situation now is not the same like the past. Dineshan Sir, who wasn't even an MLA then, is now a Minister ruling Kerala. I was a mere SI then, today I am a CI. If you disclose this to anyone now, even the Ministerial Assembly will lose power. Hey... ..just think, this is going to affect so many families. Prakasha.. ..look. The case is closed. The sentence is also over. All these matters are over. They are matters that everybody has forgotten. Nobody other than us, know all these things. And now no one else should know all this. Prakasha.. ..I am saying this for the benefit of everyone. We'll keep this under wraps. Whoever we try to keep under wraps.. ...can we hide it from God, Sir? Am I not an offender in the eyes of God? Isn't it? Just because you all told me that day.. ...I killed Ganeshan Sir. And did I get any benefit from that? Did I? After a long wait of 11 years, my baby died in wife's womb itself, Sir. I've lost my peace of mind, Sir. I am a sinner, Sir. A grave sinner! I should be punished for the crime I committed, Sir. I will see that no harm comes to any one of you. I'll undertake my punishment, redeem my sins and.. ..I want to pray to God peacefully, Sir. You are right, Prakasha. Whatever you said is right. Anyway you are a man with a good heart. When you said it.. ...I realised the depth of the crime we committed. But what to do? This whole world.. ..is full of devils. Amidst these devils.. ...a good hearted man like you is not needed. Sir..no. Sir... Now you directly go to God and confess. Hello.. Hello.. Hello.. Hey.. Hey..wait there! Hey, I said wait there. You! Hey you! Please. Have you gone crazy? Don't you know the place where you killed and buried them? Then why the hell.. Then why did you take the media along with you? But I didn't bury the body at that place. 2 kms away from there... ..at Pethotty. That girl has chalked a watertight plan and trapped you. Now can you say that you didn't bury it there? She is a sharp player. But.. ...I can't understand one thing. How did that girl come to know the place you killed and buried them? I don't know Sir. (Mobile chimes) What's the problem there? What happened to Karunan? Sir, a girl has planned and trapped the CI. Why? -Because CI killed that girl's lover. But the problem is that.. ...where the boy's body was found, there was a pastor's body too. That has become a very big headache now, Sir. We are enquiring, how that pastor's body reached there. Don't try to dredge into further details. Why Sir? Any problem? Karunan should come out Scot free in any way, ok? Ok Sir. Hail the Swamy! At last the CI has accepted everything. Everything? - Hmm. CI had gone to the forest to see the informer who gave him information about Maoists. But he didn't turn up. After waiting for a long time.. ..while coming back he realised that his watch was missing. That's not true, Sir. Not only that. That deceased pastor was Karunan's informer. But that wildlife photographer.. ..was not an ordinary photographer. He was the informer of the Maoists. An Anti social man! Anti social man! The story is good. Will it work out? If so.. ...shall I call him a lover? So you have dug out all the information? Won't we? After all we are from the police. Ok then hear this, Sir. The person who died there in that forest was my life. CI should say why that happened. I will force him to say that. - Hey. Cool. Cool. Janaki, I know what you want. But now this issue has gone to the higher level. Who do you think that CI Karunan is? The matter is at the Minister level now. Now more and more new stories will be framed. Look here. We have been told to remand you in custody for 2-3 days. Within this time that Vivek whom you mentioned in your story we will fetch his body from the forest. After that forensic report, postmortem report, all this will follow. What can we do? And if that too turns against you then? So that will also turn out to be against me, isn't it Sir? Sir.. No one has killed me. Who is spreading these false stories? So where were you all these days? I had gone for a leisure trip. Just because you can't reach me on the mobile, that doesn't mean I'm dead. What nonsense is all this? Now how's that Sir? Some people say lies even after swearing. I spoke to that girl. Sir. That photographer was her lover. She knows it very well that you have killed him. All this dramatic show was to dredge the truth out. I'm doing everything possible I can as a policeman to protect you. And I hope she doesn't know that Minister's story. Pray to God, that she doesn't come to know about it. Karunan. -Sir. CPO Shivan is our trusted aide. Whatever you want, only ask him. Sir. Did you get me? - Sir. Sir, I'll be back soon. - Ok. If you're sleepy, then go and sleep. There's no need for both of us to remain awake. Ok then Sir, when you feel sleepy call me. - Ok. Sir if you want to go to the washroom, you may go. (Mobile chimes) Hello. - Baby. It's me Karunan. Hey, why did you call here now? The whole media is behind you. Once they come to know this too 'The accused CI has a connection with the Home Minister.' ..this will be the news in tomorrow's newspaper. You just hang up. Just a minute. It might be a problem for you now, when I call. But long back I too joined to kill and incinerate many in order to achieve that chair. Don't forget that Baby. Hey, I didn't say it to hurt you. Don't you know? Sir is in America. Even from there he has done all the arrangements for you. But when this media and these evidences stand strong there is a limit for what Sir can do. Anyway, you don't get tensed. Let me see, if anything can be done. Then...don't call this side. I'll call you. He says there are limits! If I'm trapped I won't go alone. I'll take everybody along. Sir...Sir...Sir.. Sir...Sir..what was the incident? When was the incident, Sir? This happened yesterday night. Only this constable was along with him. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Santosh Sir. Sir.. Sir. Karunan committed suicide after admitting his crime. He was very mentally disturbed. His crime would be caught and in front of the society in front of his colleagues he would have to bend his head in shame. That may be the reason for this. Why did CI kill the pastor? Vengeance! That is the reason for pastor's death. Since Ashwin was the eye witness to the murder, he killed Ashwin also, to destroy the evidence. Sir what was Janaki's role in this case? Madam..Madam..what was this dramatic play for? Please say. What was this drama for? How did you come to know that CI was responsible for this murder? Hey. Hey, please. Madam what do you have to say? How did you know that CI was the convict? Please, please. - Please say Madam. Do you doubt anyone else? Janaki is a lady who confessed her crime and surrendered at the station to solve her lover's death. Many questions remain unanswered due to her silence. For unattained justice finding ways on her own the shocking revelation of a rare and extremely courageous battle fought by a girl. To the scalding answers, Kerala is eagerly waiting for. 'Ini Utharam' Welcome, Dr. Janaki. Just one question. Didn't you have fear doing this? If I say no, then it will be a lie. I was very tensed. But my Ashwin was above all that for me. Even after knowing everything.. ..I couldn't spare the one who killed him. But the most imperative question regarding this matter. With no witnesses with no evidences amidst the darkness of the night a murder that took place in the forest how did you figure out so precisely that CI was the murderer? Ashwin and I were in love for the past 5 years. Saturday, the next day after he was killed.. ..we had planned a trip. According to what Ashwin said, I took 2 days leave from the hospital.. ...and I left by 9 o'clock. We had planned to travel the next day by early morning itself. But when he didn't call me even by 9 pm, I tried calling him. But his phone was switched off. By late night, when I couldn't contact Ashwin... ..I called our common friend Vivek. Hello. - Hello. Hey Vivek, where are you? I am at the farm. Why are you calling so late? Did Ashwin call you? -Hmm. I am not able to call him. His phone is switched off. When I was heading to the town at evening, he got into my car and got down at Pooppara. He said he was going to take click pictures of some Barn owls. When I came back, I called but didn't get him. His phone was switched off. He will be at home. Did you call his home? No, that number is also switched off. Is it? Don't simply get tensed. I'll go and check in the morning. Hmm. With no peace of mind, the next day morning itself I reached Vivek's farmhouse. It's a rough road. We will go by my vehicle. He hasn't reached home also. Has he gone to some friend's place? But will he remain without calling me? Didn't you say that you dropped him at the Pooppara forest? Yes right. Did you see this? His last location is still there itself. Ashwin.. Ashwin.. Ashwin. Ashwin. Ashwin.. Ashwin.. Seeing the signs of some struggle we examined the surroundings. Ashwin. - And found Ashwin's broken spectacles.. CI Karunan's name board.. and we saw a pit close by, with something concealed under it. That's when Vivek said that he had seen CI going hurriedly somewhere when he came back from the town. In a situation where the investigating police officer was the accused we felt that there are possibilities that this case will be wiped off somehow. So we decided to bring this to light at any cost. The day the murder took place I was confident that I could prove that I was in the hospital. So I cooked up a story on my own and surrendered myself at the station. Janaki is an example. Imprinted by the society as the weaker sex.. ...this is an example of a woman's self confidence. Even if it's not imitable.. ...more Janakis should be born to ensure justice in such situations. With an answer to another question that offers you sleepless nights we will meet again. Good bye. Sir. In the pastor's murder case since the accused is dead..? -Yes, yes, we should report it to the court as abet charge. Sir. - Then take a detailed statement of the doctor who performed the postmortem we have to add him too as the witness before giving the charge. Sir. - Ok? Sir. Sir's calling you. -Hmm. Sir. Janaki come. Yesterday... ...whatever you proclaimed in the channel.. ...I wanted to record that as a statement and hence I called you. After sometime you shouldn't say that, that was also a story. Any story I say ahead can't help me regain the irreparable loss I had, Sir. Janaki. Congrats. For what? Where many thought you would fail, you battled it to attain success. I had no other way out. Anyway, thank you for everything. What's this Janaki? It looks like you've done a job that you're not habitual to. Last day I planted a coconut tree sapling at home. It's good to plant a tree, Janaki... ..but if the soil isn't suitable, however hard you moisten it, it won't sprout. These are the phone locations of CI sir. CI had gone to that forest even the next day after committing the murders. That was surely to destroy the evidences. Then, how come there remained a fake spectacles there which was detectable to all? Ashwin never used spectacles, Janaki. Will any sensible person take people to the spot where he killed and buried the bodies? Would CI who was so gutsy, commit suicide? Say the truth. What exactly happened there? Sir, if what you want is an answer the person who could answer this the only one was the CI. But what to do? He is not alive now. Shall I leave Sir? Now will he probe into the details and come back at us, Janu? Hey.. Something has happened to him. Ashwin! - Ashwin! Janu.. Janaki.. Janu, what are you doing? So are you saying we should spare the one who killed our Ashwin? If you call back the murderer, he will frame us as the accused. Please understand, Janu. We have to leave as soon as possible. 'Home minister Palliyil Dineshan is leaving on Monday' 'for the 5 days visit in USA.' Will you stand with me? Take this. Please bring some water. Where's the water? - Mom was on the call. Damn with your mother! I understand. You have people outside. Anyways one day, this video will be out. Isn't it? Your idea is good. But this doesn't matter to me. A girl came to the station and said that she killed someone. Immediately, the media followed her to the station. Then she took the media along to the place where she killed and buried the body. She then says that she and the CI killed him together. But ma'am. I am a policeman. Won't I speculate? For that, I thought about it deeply and typed it to show it to you. Yes Sir. But, when I saw your confidence I thought that you based all this on some solid reason. So I waited just to know it. Now I know it. So now, if I cook up some new story and put you behind bars... I can save the Minister and the CI. Not only that... I'll have a promotion in the process. How's that? Isn't it super? Isn't that wrong Sir? - Hey.. relax... relax.. But I won't do like that. Do you know why? I liked you. A girl should be like you. Instead of simply cribbing and crying about what happened... You came alone and shook us all. Super! So Janaki tell me what do you want? That's not possible Sir. That girl has solid evidences with her. Evidences about CI going and being there and his phone details are all clear. Not only that Sir. We obtained all these evidences in front of the media. Can't you dump the blame on that girl? No Sir, not possible. There are proper evidences that she was at the hospital at the time of the murder. Then tell Karunan to surrender. Rest we'll manage as it comes. Not possible Sir. I talked to him. He said that if he has to go behind bars, he won't go alone. Not only that Sir. In that Pastor's issue, there's some big shot involved. Why? Did he say something? No Sir. Any problem? Huh..no! Sir, if we rush all this... ..it will lead to the leaking of that VIP's issue. Just thinking about it is splitting my head. Sir, at this moment, better than Karunan being alive it would be ideal if he commits suicide in an emotional move. Then we'll be safe Sir. We can set up a confession note and close the case. That will put an end to that girl's problem also. So if he commits suicide, will everything be solved? Sir..how's that Sir? Hello...hello...Sir. Sir.. -Why are you here? Even if you let us go free, that SP caught hold of us. He has summoned us for questioning. - Huh. I heard that you've been trapped. That's not a big issue. I'll come out of this. We've seen this so times. Isn't it? Yeah.. Exactly! What's it? What's it man? Sorry Sir. We have been instructed to kill you. Nazar..! No. Sir, don't you know if Nazar takes up a job.. Hey..leave me. Nazar don't do it. Once we undertake it, can we back off, Sir? Don't you know once Nazar undertakes a task..Sir? Sir, not only that.. The next day after CI committed the murder.. ..Vivek and Janaki had gone to that forest. It was there that Vivek's phone got switched off. Sir, there is one more thing we left unnoticed. There were two phone connections in Janaki's name. The deceased Ashwin was using one of it since long. That day who called CI was.. ..not Janaki. It was Ashwin. So I firmly believe, there is a connection between CI's suicide and Janaki. Prashanth. Nobody will wish to commit a mistake. But after committing a mistake, they'll surely wish to be rescued. Did you understand? You didn't understand, right? This is stated in the Tamil Tirukkural (classic book). I also didn't understand it. We'll have tea? -Sure Sir. Sir.. Ayappa Das.. Why are you scared? Didn't you get your suspension order? Can't you leave? Prashanth, come. Didn't that Sir promise to save you? Hmm..he'll say that he will take care..take care.. ..and then he'll play Judas on you. Shucks! Hold this. Let me go and get my share. Is this his job all day? Sir.. Didn't I slap you? -Hmm. Slap me back. -Huh..? Sir.. -Actually... I just thought about it. If we aren't bitten by a mosquito, we'll think that there's no mosquito in this place. So don't fix the mosquito net. Let them bite. Ok. We shouldn't think deeply about certain things. We'll have a headache. I don't think deeply.
