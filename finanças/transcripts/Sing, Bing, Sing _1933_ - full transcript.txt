Won't you let me take you far away to the place I call my hideaway? Only love will have the right of way in my hideaway. There's a cozy cabin built for two, and a silvery lake for a canoe. I will be in paradise with you in my hideaway. We'll be so happy there where romance fills the air. We'll be a loving pair as the years roll by. When your golden hair has turned to grey, I'll be loving you the same old way. You'll be mine forever and a day in my hideaway. Now, Helen, darling, be ready in 15 minutes. I've got the license and the ladder by the garden wall. Pack your suitcase. Put it over on your old man this time. Oh, you bet we will, honey. I'll be waiting. OK, sweetheart. Now when you hear me whistle-- The time will be exactly 10:00 PM. Get out of here. Now when you hear me whistle-- --you start down that ladder. Remember, not a move till you hear the whistle. Hurry, darling. Shh. Ah, sweetheart. At last we fooled your dad. Oh, no you haven't. Mr. Lake. Yes, Mr. Lake. I heard your message over the radio. Thought I'd be listening to Amos and Andy, didn't you? You can't steal my promised bride. I have a good notion to knock your block off. Oh yeah? Thought we heard a little noise. Is there anything-- wrong? Plenty. Listen here, young man. I've told you time and time again that Helen's too young to get married. Well, she's going to marry me eventually. Why not now? Oh no, she isn't. My daughter will never marry a radio crooner. That's right where you're wrong. Prosperity is just around the crooner. Now get out. Right away? Right away. Thank you for the right of way. Harry, put that flashlight in your pocket before you spill it. That's the spirit. Now in spite of these two defectives of yours, I'll bet you 50 to one I marry your daughter in the morning. Bah. Good odds. I'll take that bet. I'll hold the stakes. Now scram. Goodbye now. I'll see you after the wedding. I should hate you, but I guess I love you. You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea. I forgive you 'cause I can't forget you. You've got me right between the devil and the deep blue sea. I ought to cross you off my list. But when you come knocking at my door, hate seems to give my heart twist and I come running back for more. I don't want you, but I can't live without you. You've got me right between the devil and the deep blue sea. Not anymore now, honey. We have to hurry. Dad locked me in his room and I couldn't get out. Well then, where are you phoning from? Pa's transom. Pa's what? Pa's transom. I'm still in his room. Well come on out and get a wiggle on. I'll be waiting. OK, Bing. I'll try to squeeze through. Papa! Oh, papa. It's you. Yeah, it's me Where you going? Oh, I'm just going out to feed your pet gorilla. You know if Charley doesn't gets his milk on time, he gets terribly angry. Hmm. Well you didn't need to telephone to him first. Besides, Herbert's feeding him. You can't fool me. You get into that room, young lady. Get in there. But papa. Charley? Herbert? Were are you? Here we are, Mr. Lake. Herbert, how in the world did you get up there? Oh, Charley wouldn't go back in his cage. Oh. Charley. Charley. Come Nice milk, Charley. Come, come. Come on. Back in your cage, Charley. Come on. Come on, Charley. Oh! Herbert! Herbert! Yes? I can't see at all. Well, I would-- I would help you, Mr-- Who me? Lovable, lovable, how I'd love to be your one and only. Can't you care a little bit for lonely me? Say, you're lovable, lovable. I'm so happy just to be around you. And I'm mighty lucky that I found you free. I call you lovable. Say, that's the name that fits you like a glove. And you're wonderful, marvelous, made for me to love. Lovable, lovable, how I'd love to be the one you care for. Can't you find a little love to spare for me? Scat. Holmes, Barnes, are you in there? Oh, we got to get out of here fast. Oh, hurry. --Marvelous, made for me-- There he is behind that bush. I'll stop that canary with some of this bird shot. I got him. There'll be no eloping now. You killed him. Well, it's always open season for crooners. Bah. Come on. Oh! Doh! Com on, Charley. This is no time for fooling. Oh, you big cutie. He wants to play. I want to get married. Oh, here Charley. Here. Here, Charley. Now here's a lollipop, and don't let them catch us. There they come! Stop them! After him boys! After him! You! Oh! Oh! Ouch! Please! Ah! Ow! Please! Step on it, Bing. They're coming after us. Ah. They'll never catch us. Stop, Charley. Don't. Make him let go, Mr. Lake. Charley, let go. Get over there. From there. Charley, come here. Charley, stop it now. Stop it. Stop it, I say. Look out! Look out! Oh! Let go of that! I'll put him back here with us. Get that gorilla out of here. Charley! Charley! Hey! Don't you let him have that wheel. Cut it out, Charley. Charley, let go of that. Go on. Oh, he's got the wheel. Charley! Charley! What are we going to do? Oh, I can't. I'm trying to. Oh! Well, now what'll we do? I don't know. Ah, you-- Hey, you can't do that. Snuggled on your shoulder, cuddled in your arms. Dreaming while we're flying, say, I'm thrilled by all your charms. While the music is playing, I'm in ecstasy. Sweetheart, hear me saying how this is heavenly. We're sailing away from dad, what a grand sensation. Sailing, say, this isn't bad. You're my inspiration. Let me fly forever and I can dream about your charms while I'm snuggled on your shoulder, and I'm cuddled in your arms.
