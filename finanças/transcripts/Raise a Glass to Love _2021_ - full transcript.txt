Here. Do you see the color? It's ruby-red, like your necklace. That means the sun was perfect this year. It's ready. Go tell your mother that we're going to have chicken tonight. It will go so well with our new wine. Go, go. Name all 44 wine villages of Burgundy. Chablis, Nuits, Macon... Oh. I'm almost ready. Calm down, sweetie. It's only me. Just wishing my best friend good luck on the most important day of her life. No pressure, right? Promise me once you pass your master sommelier exam, you'll come home to visit. We miss you in little old Carington. If I pass. Hey, don't second-guess yourself. - You got this. - Thanks. Oh! And guess who's awarding badges this year? Taylor Swift? No. Jennifer Huether. She's probably the best-known woman to ever become a master somm. Anyway, I've got to run. All right. Call me later. Okay. Love you. Bye. Good morning. Hi. Good morning, Miss Savern. Glad to see you trying again. Thank you. It's an honor to be back. Good luck. Miss Savern, you have 30 minutes to identify all six wines correctly. Starting now. This wine is clean, crisp, fresh. Light body, medium-light. Flavors of slate, citrus, unripe pear, hint of oak, hint of salt. Ocean air. This is a Chardonnay from France. Burgundy, Chablis, Grand Cru. Les Clos, 2016. This wine is medium-bodied. New World. Flavors of lemongrass, grapefruit, mango. Sauvignon blanc from Wairau Valley, 2019. O Rosal, 2018, from Rias Baixas. Saint-Julien, 2008, from Bordeaux, France. Zinfandel, Rutherford. 2018 from Napa Valley, California, USA. Um... This wine is medium-heavy. Opaque. Notes of... raspberry, plum... lots of fruit. It's a... Malbec... from San Rafael, Argentina. Wait. Not Malbec. Cabernet Sauvignon? Uh, no, that's not final. Ten seconds. Um... Cahors France, 2016? Congratulations. Thank you, Miss Huether. Ugh, I knew it was the San Rafael Malbec, and I second-guessed myself. The master sommelier exam is the most difficult test in the world. Lots of people don't pass the first... Or even second time. Well, you did. I can't believe I have to wait another year to try again. Jenna, you don't have to be a master somm to succeed. Or for me to love you. I do if I ever want to work at a high-end restaurant like Alluvial. Just don't beat yourself up. You know, statistically, it's easier to become an NBA player than a master somm. There's only 190 in the world. Yeah, and only 27 women. I really wanted to be one of them. On the bright side, now that it's over, you can put the cards away. We can relax. Look, you worked really hard. You owe yourself a break. I just got invited to do a tasting in Santa Barbara. Be my date? Okay... Okay. But I am going to take the test again, and I am going to bring my books. Of course. I have sold 12 bottles of the Fleur de Ciel tonight. Excellent work as always, Edwin. I have half a bottle left. Would you like to try it? Sure, I'll have a taste. It's as much about who you enjoy the wine with as the vintage itself. Now, this winemaker has won best winery in the world two years in a row. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. What do you think? It's slightly off-balance. There's a hint of acidity. Uh, "Wine Enthusiast" gave this bottle 98 points. I had to beg just to get 10 cases. Right. I'm sure I'm just exhausted. Who am I to argue when so many people love it? Um, I'm going to head home. Okay. See ya. - Bye, Edwin. - Ciao. Enjoy. Congratulations. - Have a good day. - Thanks. Okay, Spanish wine. France... Germany... - Hey, Dad. - Well, let me guess. Champagne, 1973. Hmm... nice guess, but I am working on Spanish wines right now. You know, I heard you were actually taking some time off work. Um, I wouldn't call it time off. The test is exactly a month away, and I have a ton of studying to do. You got time in all that studying for a party? Um, definitely not. What if I told you it was the 40th anniversary surprise party I'm planning for your mom? Dad, that is wonderful! Yes, I can definitely make it home for the party. Well, why don't you come up for a couple of weeks before? There's nothing but peace and quiet up here. It sounds really nice, but I have my routine here, and my books, and... Also, the Carington Food and Wine Festival is this week, and the wine competition is being judged by Jennifer Huether. Wait. You're kidding. I know you too well to kid about something like that. - So are you in? - You know what? Yes. This sounds like just what I need. Yeah, that's your mom calling. I'll text you later. All right. Love you. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hey, you. Hey! What are you doing here? I just thought I'd stop by, see you. That's sweet. Yeah, find out what's selling. Hey, guess what? My dad wants me to come home and help out with their 40th wedding anniversary. Yeah, may be good for you to relax before the test. Yeah, but I want you to come, too. And not the whole time. Maybe... a week? To test you? No. To relax. And to test me... What? Two weeks is a long time to be away. You know, I wish I could, but, you know, the restaurant. Okay. I understand. But I will be there for the party. - Great. - Okay. - Thanks. - Okay. - I'll see you tonight. - See you later. Bye. Bye. Come on. Let's go see who it is. Hey, that's her! Hi, Dad! Hi! Hey, so good to see you, sweetie. So good to see you, too. Look who it is. Hey, Baxter. Hi, buddy. Oh, look at you. - Oh, Dad! - You look so great. Hi, Mom. I missed you. She needs to breathe. She needs to breathe. Look at you. My master sommelier. We are so proud of you. Not yet, Mom. The exam is still a month away. Oh, well, you will pass this time. Well, supposedly, I did really well with the theory and the service parts of the exam. I just still need to master the tasting. You'll get there this time. Hey, guess who I saw at the post office today? Who? Allison, and she is so excited to see you. I can't wait to see her. There are so many people on the lawn. Well, that's our new winemaker. He's made some good changes. Huh. You think he could fix the sign on the front gate? We have been working very hard on the land. Why don't you let me show you around? Go, go. Do you milk those? They eat weeds. They eat all kinds of things. Okay. Dad, I can't believe you planted a whole new section on the hill. Grandma Ellie never wanted to plant here. It's so dry, especially with fire season coming. It's all about drainage. Marcelo is into doing everything... naturally. I don't know. Aidan thinks natural wines are a fad. Everyone around here's going organic. No pesticides. Well, they don't sell as well or keep as long as traditional wines. They're a lot more expensive to produce. Plus, they tend to be a bit... sour. Why don't you tell me what you really think, honey? Come on. Let's go. Okay. Hey. Thanks. Oh, no. Dad, look. Aphids. Ugh. You have to be careful. I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure Marcelo's got a plan. How have the reviews been? Excellent. He's really lived up to his reputation. And what reputation is that? Well, he saved a vineyard in France. The vines had all burned up in a drought. He incorporated an irrigation technique from Germany that basically brought the whole operation back to life. Huh. Impressive. Marcelo's worked all over the world. We're really lucky to have him. Come on. Let's go look at the new cellar. Marcelo, Marcelo... Hey, good morning, sweetheart. Hey, Dad. I need a favor. Your mom thinks I'm working the tasting room this afternoon, but I have to run into town and talk to the caterer about the party. So, um, can you work the tasting room today? You can bring your book if you want. Sure. It'll be like the good old days. Aw, we wish. Thanks, kiddo. You bet. - See you later, Dad. - Yeah. Hello. Welcome to Savern Vineyards. Buenos tardes. Good afternoon. Oh, buenos tardes. Are you here for a tasting? Today, we're showing our 2019 pinot noir. I could give you a tasting lesson. Sure. Great. The first thing you want to do is look at the color. What do you see? Uh, red. Yes, correct. Red. Let's try to get a little more specific. Would you say it's more like a bright poinsettia or a soft carnation? Actually, it reminds me of the ceibo flower. The one that grows back home where I'm from. Where's home? Argentina. Oh, they make fabulous wines in Argentina. I heard. I'll have to find a picture of that flower. I can always use more descriptors. What... what region are you from? Mendoza region, a little town near the... The Andes. You know your geography. You can't be a wine connoisseur if you don't. I need to learn more about those famous Malbecs. Well, the best way to learn is to go there. You should go. I should. I actually grew up here, learning from my grandmother. Ellie Savern. This is her vineyard. She was one of the first female winemakers in the region. That's quite a legacy. So do you plan to follow in her footsteps? I... I hope to, yes. I'm actually a sommelier. Wow. Now we have to smell. Close your eyes. Mm... now that we've let in the aroma of... do you smell plums? Taste? Sure. Mm. We're selling our vintage reserve pinot for $45 a bottle. Are you interested? Um... actually, I've got to get back to work, unfortunately, but it was very nice to meet you. Oh, yes. Good to meet you, too. I'm Jenna. I'm Marcelo Castillo. I'm actually the head winemaker here at Savern. And I'm sure I'll be... I'll be seeing you soon. Uh... Sales haven't been this high since Grandma Ellie passed away. I wanted Marcelo to enter the Carington Wine Competition, but he doesn't believe in them. A winemaker who doesn't believe in competitions? Oh, don't give me that look. He's very talented, and that's what matters most. I see. Hey, look who I found coming up the driveway. Jenna, this is Marcelo Castillo. Mucho gusto. We actually met. Sort of. He came by when I was working the tasting room. I thought your father was handling the tastings today. Oh, I was. She just stopped by for a little visit, you know? Hmm. Well, Marcelo, I'm sure you and Jenna will have a lot to discuss. She's a master sommelier, you know. Not yet. Honey, there may be something burning in the kitchen. Oh, my chicken. I'll be right back. Dinner is in five minutes. Uh, can I help you, Mom? I am sure it's fine! Hey. Uh... Hello. I apologize for not introducing myself earlier. You kept going, and I didn't want to stop you. Well, you could have. You were really enjoying that wine. It was... a kind of nice bottle. For a natural wine. I know, I heard from your dad. You're not the first to doubt. The problem is, if something goes wrong, there's no way to fix it. You say problem, I say challenge. But you know all about that. The exam. Yes. Your parents are really proud of you. It's really an impressive undertaking. It's only impressive if I pass. And if you pass, what do you plan to do? My boyfriend owns a three-Michelin-star restaurant in San Francisco, and I would love to get my foot in the door having real influence curating wines for restaurants. And you're taking the exam to work in a restaurant? You get a significant pay increase. And it's a very prestigious position. And very competitive, especially for women. I see. And... my grandmother... always wanted to be a master somm. But she never had time for all the studying. Well, also, running this winery, so... I... I guess I'm here trying to do what she couldn't. I see. Well, I'm certain that you have great things ahead of you, Miss Savern. Jenna... Jenna. Nice to meet you again, and goodnight. Goodnight. Jenna! Hi! Lucia, meet my best friend, Jenna. Hi, Jenna. I've heard so much about you. Lucia is amazing. I couldn't run this place without her. It is so nice to meet you. What are you ladies working on? These are ginger-walnut scones. Try one. We're doing all the sweets and treats this year for the town fair on Saturday. You'd better come. These are delicious. Of course, I will be there. Oh, here. What's this? My dad insists on paying you for the anniversary cake. Don't be silly. I practically grew up in your vineyard. And I broke the swing, remember? Well, that's because I pushed you too hard. Your dad's the greatest. He definitely deserves a free cake. So generous of you. Thank you. Hey, have you met my parents' new winemaker? - Marcelo? - Yeah. He's not that new. You just haven't been around. He came into the tasting room yesterday when I was working and pretended to be a random customer. I was going through my entire lesson. He didn't say a thing till the end. I wouldn't overthink it. He probably just didn't want to interrupt you in your element. By the way, how's Aidan? He's good. He's busy at the restaurant, but he'll be here for the party. Well, I can't wait for you to meet Derek. Derek? Wait, the journalist? Is he officially your boyfriend now? - Yeah, he is. - Ooh! He just doesn't know it yet. Oh. Hey. You still studying? Of course. Jenna, you've been studying that for three years now. Maybe just trust yourself, huh? Easier said than done, Dad. Why don't you help Marcelo figure out the wine pairings for the anniversary party? Uh, the two of us? I can do it on my own. Well, it'll be more fun together. As long as you get rid of the flashcards. Excuse me? What's wrong with flashcards? Nothing... Nothing. I just think you can't really learn about wine from flashcards. You've got to get your hands dirty from the land. Unfortunately, "the land" isn't going to teach me about the appellation d'origine contrôlée. The what? I'm kidding. I know what the French certification system is. I lived in Provence for three years. Great. Listen, if you still want my help, I can be free this afternoon. Thanks, Marcelo. That was pretty good. Bye, Dad. "The what?" Go. "The what?" What's all this? I thought we were meeting in the tasting room. It's a nice evening. I thought I'd set up a tasting outside. Thank you for doing this. Oh, my pleasure. So, um... how did you end up at Savern? I always wanted to live in California, and I saw the position online. But we weren't an organic vineyard. Well, I convinced your father to make the transition. I believe that a sustainable vineyard is a vineyard with a future. So what are you going to do about the aphids on the vines? Am I the one taking the exam? You're making a lot of changes. I want to make sure my parents are in good hands. I completely understand. Here, let's practice. Okay. Lots of herbs, pop of citrus. Grüner Veltliner from Austria. That's correct. And what would this go well with? Blue cheese and pear salad? Sounds great. - Great. - Yeah. So, um... what town are you from in Mendoza with the ceibo flower? I grew up on a vineyard in a little town called Olivia. You know my grandmother's middle name was Olivia? No, I had no idea. Wow. Yeah, anyway, unfortunately, we lost the vineyard. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose this place. Home isn't easily replaced. You're lucky. Next pour? Yes. Tempranillo. Rioja, Spain. Exactly. Very good. You know, I love Spanish wines. You know, there's this little bar called Casa de Guardia in Málaga. Where Picasso used to drink. He was born there. How did you know I was going to say that? I studied it. I think this would go well with the grilled veggies. So, um... why do you move around so much? Well, I... I love to travel. It is the perfect way to learn about a country's history while perfecting the craft of winemaking. That sounds a little like a canned response. Does it? Well, maybe I just haven't figured out where I want to settle down yet. Okay, last one. Wow. This is incredible. Um, black currant, plums... Is that cardamom? This would be too expensive to serve at the party. What... What? Is this a Malb... Why do I always mess up Malbec? I am never going to pass. Don't panic, don't panic. Um, just close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Grab a glass. What do you sense, the way your grandmother, Olivia, taught you? Tree leaves in the breeze. Raspberries and plums on a warm day. This is from Savern Vineyards, isn't it? Meet our Special Reserve Organic Malbec. A hundred percent natural. Wow. Well done. Aidan, this wine needs to be on the menu at Alluvial. It's like a Châteauneuf-du-Pape, only fruitier. Uh, yeah, Jenna, I think you might be biased. What do you mean? Well, it's your grandma's winery. Besides, you know, I couldn't possibly put anything on the menu that hasn't won an award. I know. I just... I'm... I'm excited. It's so good. Uh, look, Jenna. I've got to be on the floor. Can I call you later? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Hi. Hey, I'll make this quick. Town fair, 20 minutes, you and me, fun. Alli, I can't. I'm studying. Have you gotten your parents a gift for their anniversary yet? Uh, no. I haven't. Um, good point. Okay. I guess I can meet you at the fair and look for something there. But just for an hour. No more. Okay? One hour. Sounds good to me. See you there. Bye. It is a beautiful day. It is. Oh, look. The dunk tank awaits. Um, that's a no. How about apple bobbing? How about none of the above? You're just afraid I'm going to beat your record. What was that, like, 40 apples? 42, actually. And you will never beat me. Ah, my parents have been married for 40 years. What could I possibly get them that they don't already have? Well, I'm sure we'll find something. There's so much good stuff here. Wait. Have I told you about her? Yeah, I think once or twice or a hundred times. She's the master somm who brought fine wine into the world of entertainment and sports. She really made a name for herself. If she can do it, you can, too. Come on. - Good find. - Thanks. Hey, look who it is. - Hey! - Hey. Are you gift shopping as well? Just for myself. That's nice. Yeah, I'm looking for something to send home to my sister and nieces in Buenos Aires. Aw, that's so sweet. I'm looking for my parents' anniversary. I think I saw something earlier that your parents might like. Oh, great. - Let's check it out. - Yeah. - This would make a great sign. - That would make a perfect sign. Jinx! This is delicious. Jenna Savern, is that really you? Hey, hi. How are you? Oh, I'm just the chairwoman of this shindig, just that little thing. That's amazing. They're very lucky to have you. How long has it been? I heard you're a master somm in San Francisco and you have a boyfriend. Do I hear wedding bells? What's his name? Uh, well, his name is Aidan, and he owns a restaurant. Your mom told me all about your accomplishments. She is so proud of you. And I can't believe that Carington has its very own master sommelier. Actually, I take the exam at the end of the month, so not yet. Oh, Jenna was a star in fourth grade, and she just keeps climbing. So I guess you know our winemaker, Marcelo. We're old friends. He keeps my horses in shape. Yeah, I ride a bit. Reminds me of home. Philippe misses you. I miss Philippe. The horse. I figured. And before you ask, I don't ride. Jenna, you're still not over that little accident you had so many years ago? Uh, no, no. Still have the scar, see? Look. I don't see anything. Me neither. Okay, okay, well, maybe the scars are on my psyche, but they are there. Well, anyway, I am trying to get Marcelo to enter the Savern wines in the festival, but he keeps telling me no. Really? Yeah, I'm not interested in titles and contests. Well, you still have a few days to sign up. Oh, could you help me? This afternoon is the apple-bobbing contest, and, believe it or not, we're short on apples. I could use a few extra hands over at the Davrow Orchard. I'd love to, but I've got to go meet my boyfriend, Derek. And I really have to get back home to study. Come on, Jenna. We have to help Peggy. - You have to help Peggy. - I don't have... Yes. You can study tomorrow. Thank you, thank you. How often do you get home to Argentina? Not as often as I'd like. A couple of years in between jobs, when I'm not working. What's it like there? It's beautiful. Yeah. You know, it's kind of sad for me because I really miss the people. And we used to have these huge dinners at home with my whole family. Everyone's cooking and laughing and drinking the wine that we prepared ourselves. It was the happiest time of my life, really. So what happened? Well, I learned everything I know about wine from my father, working the vines with him. And, you know, he just built our vineyard from the ground up. I mean, from the bees, to the earth, to the flowers he cultivated. And our wine caught the eye of this big distributor, who, well, forced us to sell. And my father passed shortly after, and the wine never tasted the same. I'm so sorry. Ah... I think we have enough. I think we do. - Should we head back? - Yeah. - Success. - Success. Perfect. Thank you so much! No problem. One of our participants just backed out. Jenna, can you bob? You were so good when you were a kid. I'll do it. I'll do it. Thank you. Right this way. Oops. You're gonna be a natural. I'm excited for this. I can't wait. I'm not excited. Go, Marcelo, go! Whoo-whoo-whoo! What? Just get in there. - Whoo! - You got it, you got it! Front and center. Oh, yeah, what the heck? Yes, Lily is cleaning up. Go, Lily! Give it up for our champion. Once again, Lily Prescott! Congratulations, Lily. You were the best. I know. And for you, sir... She cheated, and I let her win. That's for you. Oh, wow, for me? Thank you so much. I will treasure this forever. No shame in second place. Listen, Peggy, can I have some of those apples to take home? Of course. You've earned it. Oh, and I should have told you. That girl wins every year. Okay, I'll see you both later, okay? Thank you, Marcelo. And have fun at the fair. Peggy? Peggy. Peggy. What is the deadline to enter the wine competition? Hello. Hey. I could smell that from down the road. Oh, well, Allison gave me her recipe, and I wanted to put Peggy's apples to the test. My kitchen was a disaster area, and your mom let me use her oven as long as I save them a piece. Have you had dinner? No, but I have to have some of that pie. Right now. Yes, you do. Ooh, it smells so good. Mm! You know what this needs? A scoop of vanilla ice cream with, like, sherry poured over top. Now you're talking like a master somm. This... all this has been really helpful. Well, that's because for me, wine is more about experiences than... than facts. The master somm at Alluvial said something similar once. What is it about that place? That is so special for you? Aidan, my boyfriend, poured his whole self into that place. Just like what my parents have here. It's... it's his love, and... I don't know. I want to be a part of it. If I could work there with him, together, I mean, that would be... the dream. I... I still... I'm not sure if I have what it takes. What? Jenna, you do. You are so talented. You can do anything you want. You just have to trust your instinct. You're ready. What are you making? This is the centerpiece for my parents' anniversary party. It looks nice. Okay, like I was saying, you know I would never ask you to carry one of my parents' wines if I didn't think it was perfect for Alluvial. Well, it's... hey. Let's see how it does in the wine competition. Well, maybe when you're here for the party, you could take a bottle back for Edwin to try. You know, I'd feel more comfortable if it had some credentials. Or if I had more credentials? No, Jenna. I know you're an advanced somm. That's not what I'm saying. What are you saying? Just see how it does in the competition. I miss you. Okay? I know things have been difficult for us lately, but you've just been busy studying. To be honest, I can't wait for it to be over so we can just be us again. Right. Marcelo. Marcelo, I want to talk to you about something. Jenna, you were asking me about my plan for aphids. Yeah. - Wait. Ladybugs? - Yeah. They're good luck, but also, they eat pests. Help me introduce my friends to their new home. Yeah, um, I want to enter us in the Carington Wine Competition. Yeah, but I think it's too late to sign up. I entered us. I'm sorry. I had to. Ah. If you believe in your methods, you should stand behind them. I think the wine speaks for itself. Thanks. You're scared. No. Look, I'm... I'm scared, too, that I'm going to fail the test again. But that is no reason not to try. Are you going to help me with that? Yeah. Once the owners start thinking about competitions, all they care about is pleasing the critics. And then the wine just loses all integrity and purpose for me. I believe in what you are creating right now. I don't need attention. Marcelo, please. Do this for me. For my family. This is the only way we can get your wine distributed. It deserves to be in restaurants... Why is that so important? Can't it just be an amazing wine that we make for our friends and family and people who actually love it, from our hearts? Well, why not share what's in your heart with the world? You have a gift, Marcelo. Marcelo? Yes? I... I want to apologize. For yesterday. I overstepped, entering the competition against your wishes. I thought I was doing what was best for my family, but... I'm sorry. How can I make it up to you? Meet me out front in an hour. And bring your boots. Oh, no. No, no, no. Wait. Is this what I think it is? Okay. Here we are. Hello. Hey, Peggy. - Peggy. - Come. What are we doing here? You'll see. Honestly, no, I don't like horses, remember? I'm proud of you, Jenna. Hey. I've been telling you all along that you need to get back on that horse and have fun again. Uh, what's happening here? Didn't you want to make it up to me? A horse r... No. No. I think I've changed my mind. Marcelo, you can go. I'm going to stay here. I'm going to watch. - I'm watching. - No. Your stallion awaits. Uh, is it really a stallion? He's not a stallion. He's a gelding. It's a horse. And he's your friend. Come on. He's not my friend. Come on. Here we go. Okay, so this is Philippe. Hi, Philippe. Okay, uh, no. I can't. I can't. - Oh, yes, you can. - I'm not doing this. Yes, I'm going to help you up. This way. So you put your hand here. Okay. Um... Yes, and your foot. That's right. - You got it. - You got it. You got it. You're a pro. Okay. Okay. All right, Philippe. Be my friend. Thank you. You ready? Okay. Oh! - Have a good ride. - Thank you, Peggy. - Peggy. - You got this. Okay, okay. Not so fast, not so fast. Come on, we're barely trotting. Okay, just tighten your reins. - Wait, wait, wait. - There you go. It's so bumpy. Okay, wait, wait. Where did you learn to ride like this? Please, talk to me. Okay, when I was a kid in Argentina, I love horses. Always have. My uncle had a ranch in La Pampa, and sometimes, we'd find the occasional caballo criollo. What... what is that? Criollo is the wild horse of Argentina. They're like Ferraris of horses. And, yeah, we'd round them up and bring them to the ranch and break them in. Wait. You used to break in wild horses? That's right. Of course you did. Wow, look. It's so beautiful. What vineyard is this? Noni Vineyards. You grew up here and you don't know these little places? Well, I was off... Well, first to UC Davis, and then to Paris for a year. I've been in the restaurant industry ever since. Okay. And then I even took a job at a wine shop to study more. So I've been busy, okay? - I've been busy. - All right. Oh, wow. Do you see this grape? This is called "carménère". This is exactly the grape that we had in our vineyard. Of course. Yeah. We're further east, so it's fresher and cooler. Wow. The same one. You really should own your own vineyard. I would love to someday. Well, what about this one? It'd be perfect for you. Even the bees are here. So can we be done? Are we done now? - Get me off? - Let's keep going. - Wait. Really? - Come on. Okay, Philippe. Come on. You're doing great. - Oh! - Yes, that's it. So what do you think? Am I forgiven? Argh... yes. Yeah. I'm very proud of you. You were very brave trying horseback riding again. Thanks. And you should get some sleep. We are starting early tomorrow. Early? Mm. The festival picnic, remember? Yes, we told Allison we'd help her set up. Yes, right. I'll pick you up at 8:00. - Okay. - Okay? Great. Good night. Good night. So my last day will be Friday. Do you really have to leave immediately? The opportunity to work in Paris doesn't come around every day. Listen, I'd like to make a recommendation for my replacement. Please. Of course. You know how much I trust your judgment. Jenna. Jenna? She has a real sense for wine. She picks up on notes even I miss. Talent like that shouldn't be ignored. I'll certainly consider it. - It's been a pleasure. - Take care. Wait. Edwin quit? Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. Are you looking for a replacement? Uh-huh. Wait, Aidan? Aid... Hello? Hel... Um, okay. I guess we got cut off. Yeah, it's a bad patch for cell service here. Everything okay? Um, yeah. The head sommelier at Alluvial just quit, and now Aidan's stressing about whether he can take time off to come to the party. That's not for another week. I'm sure he can have it figured out by then. That's the job you wanted, isn't it? Mm-hmm. - Yeah, it is. - Yeah. How long have you guys been together? Three years. That's serious. It's everything I want in a relationship. He's smart. He's driven. He knows everything about wine. Then it should be an easy search. He's got the answer right in front of him. Is there... anyone special in your life? A long time ago. In Germany. Yeah. She wanted me to stay, and I wasn't ready. Sometimes, I wonder if that was a mistake. But I don't know. It didn't feel like... home. Oh, no. - What's going on? - Well, where's Lucia? She's sick, today of all days. I've been such a mess all morning. I've been trying to finish baking and packing all by myself. And the last batch just burned. Okay, we're here to help. Look at this! I'm beyond help! Okay, Marcelo and I will head to the fair - and set up your table. - Yeah. You can stay here and keep baking. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, sure. The cupcakes! Good afternoon, ladies. This is our late-harvest Zinfandel. It's made right here in Carington. It has nice notes of hazelnut flavor with a hint of cherry and cinnamon. It pairs perfectly with Allison's chocolate cupcakes. Oh, I love it. You can really taste the cinnamon. Did you know it's a natural wine? Really? It's perfect. Good. Enjoy. Okay, okay. Great. Okay... Hey, you're really good with the kids. I'm not. I just pretend to be their coach. Carriage rides! Last call for carriage rides! We should go. We? Me? No. Oh, no, no, no. I'm good. No. No, no, no. No... No. That was a long day. Yeah. And you were great in the wine service. Great. I mean, your passion really comes through when you talk to people. Thanks. You know what? The land I showed you on the horse ride? - Yeah? - It's for sale. Wait. It is? Yeah. Well, are you going to buy it? Oh! I don't think I could afford it. I mean, not yet. I send money home every month to my mom and my sister in Argentina, so it would be difficult. What about investors? Or maybe a partner? I mean... I guess... it wouldn't be a bad idea, but it has to be the right partner. Yeah. Well, I think you should go for it. If it's your dream. That's the thing about America. Everyone says go after your dreams, but very few people actually do. Except you. Well, we'll see how that goes. Oh, are you cold? No, it's fine. It's just a breeze off the... - Here, there you go. - Lake. That's nice. Thank you. Ask me about the viscosity of alcohol dynamics. Actually, can we pick this up tomorrow, please? Yeah, okay. Um, hey, how's it going with replacing Edwin? Tough. You know, I'm interviewing new people every day. Actually, Jeremy Kemp's coming in for a second interview. Is he any good? Uh, he's very dry... Personality-wise... But he knows his wine. Of course. He's a master somm. Jenna. How soon do you need someone? As soon as possible. It's not easy running the restaurant and being the somm at the same time. I was thinking after I took the exam, maybe you would consider... Jenna, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Hey. Hi, Aidan. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, hi, Mike. No, no, it's fine. I'll talk to you later? Yeah. Of course. Bye, hon'. Listen, I need your help to get Mom out of the house so I can bring in some tables and chairs in behind the cellar. There's a candle-making thing over at the fair. Could you take her to that? Sure, Dad. Of course. You're great. I think maybe I should stick to wine. Well, being master sommelier is talent enough. But I'm not, though. I'm not. Mom, you know I've already failed this test before. Twice. And you acting like it's already over and done with just makes me even more nervous. Especially when you keep telling people about it. I suppose I've gotten ahead of myself, bragging about my daughter, yes. Look, I'm sorry. I just... I don't want to let you down. Honey... you could never, ever let me down. I'll stop talking about it. Thanks, Mom. Yeah. You know, your father's and my anniversary is coming up. Ah, yes, that is... just around the corner, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Well, I'm starting to worry your father's forgotten all about it. Dad! Mom thinks you forgot about your anniversary. I was going to take her out to dinner on Friday night. Okay, so what's your plan for her on Saturday while we're setting up? Just send her to the fair, I guess? Again? You should take her to the Sea Ranch overnight on Friday. Don't you need my help for the setup? What we need is for Mom to get out of the house and not suspect anything. Marcelo and I can handle it here. All right. It's a good idea. Great. Also, are you familiar with Noni Vineyard? Oh, sure. That's my friend Gil Crowley's place. I went to UC Davis with him. He named it after his daughter. Huh. It's been on the market for a while. Are you interested in buying a vineyard? Oh, no, it's not for me. - It's... - Jenna! Jenna! Be right back, Dad. - Hey. - Hey. We were just talking about you. Wait. Before you say anything, I have a surprise for you. Can you come? - Now? - Yeah, okay. Yeah? Hey, my dad knows the guy who owns that vineyard that we saw. - Really? - Yeah. Have you ever had Argentinean food? Um... No! Not homemade. Oh, señorita. Okay, it'll be ready in a moment. Okay. Yeah. Oh, it smells amazing. I have not been in the winemaker's cabin since... since my grandma passed away. Well, your dad offered to find me a place in town, but I usually rather live in the land I'm working. I see you've made a few updates. Yeah. Only the essentials. You kept my grandmother's paintings out. I like them. Oh, she was so gifted. - Aah! - Oh, wait. - Can I help you? - Sorry, sorry. Please, let me help you. I can... I'm okay, thanks. Sit, please. - I... - Okay. Okay, these are empanadas. Oh, they look perfect. Yeah. And wait for it. We've got churrasco. Okay. Oh... Churrasco... which is... gaucho-style steak. And you must... have a little bit of this. What is it? Chimichurri. But classic style. Verde. Oh! That is incredible. I must have the recipe. Well, the recipe is actually watching my father on the outdoor grill when I was a kid. But really, it's parsley. Fresh parsley. Parsley? Okay, parsley's the secret weapon. Yes. Finely chopped. Uh-huh. And for tonight's pairing, guess the wine? Yes, yes. Of course. I'd love to. Yes, and I promise it goes really well with the meal. All right. Thanks. Hmm. High tannins. Cool, crisp. This is a Malbec from the Andes. It's very earthy. Wait, I think that's the parsley. Maipú region. Bodega Zucconda. 2002? So close. Oh. This is actually from my family's vineyard. Río Córdoba, 2002. That was a very special year. Only a few bottles of it remain. But that year, the cool air and the wind just helped the grapes produce this incredible wine... Our best ever, really. And this bottle travels with me everywhere I go. So, wait, you opened this bottle... just for me? I can't think of anyone else I'd rather share it with. Well, because... you appreciate it. I do. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Eat. - Okay. Oh, I'm so full. That was the best meal I've had my whole life. What? What about three Michelin stars? That's not everything. Well, I want to show you something. I was cleaning the cupboard, and I found this. Tell me, is this you as a little girl? Yes. Yes, it is. My grandma must have painted this. I've never seen this before. Well, you know what? It would make a great anniversary present. Are you sure? That's so thoughtful of you. Thanks. You got it. There. Yeah? - What? - Hey, be careful. Don't float away. Ah, Aidan. Hey! So when do you get here? Jenna, I'm so sorry. I have to tell you something. What's wrong? Are you all right? I was really hoping I'd be able to find the right person for today. But I've been scrambling all week, so I've decided... I can't come to the party. I'm so sorry. I mean, I've made offers, but so far, no one's accepted. I really thought I could make it down in time, but I just can't leave the restaurant right now. So you're not coming? Sorry. It's fine. I'll see you when I get back. Okay. Bye. You okay? Do you want to talk? The sommelier position has been open for a week, and Aidan didn't even think to interview me. It's like I'm not even in the running. I'm sorry, Jenna. Who knows when an opening like this could happen again? Maybe you can work at another restaurant? Is there something he doesn't see in me? Hi. Hello. - Hey. - Hey. Blanc de blanc? Absolutely. [{Allison] Jenna! - Hi! - Hey, welcome. I've got the cake in the car. Where should I put it? Perfect. The cake will go right here. I've got the you-know-what. Ah, perfect. Oh. They're five minutes away. Okay, everyone. They're five minutes away. Get ready to hide. Okay, let's do this. Shh. Come on this way. Surprise! Happy 40th. You pulled it off, Dad. You, Mike, and you! Thank Marcelo. He helped so much, Mom. Happy anniversary! Cheers to Mom and Dad! Yay! I would just like to say thank you to all of you for sharing this magical night with us. It's good to know that after 40 years of marriage, we're still surprising each other. I would also like to say a special thank you to our daughter, Jenna, of whom I am so proud. It just means the world to me, sweetie. Speech. - Me? - Speech! Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Mom and Dad, you have been an inspiration to me throughout my life. You've shared your passion for wine with me. You've always encouraged me to follow my own path. Most importantly, you've shown me how a foundation of love makes everything possible. You've taught me what real love looks like, and... I'm forever grateful to both of you for that. Thank you. And I know that you've been making a lot of changes around here, but there was one thing I noticed still needed a little sprucing up. So... ta-dah! It's a new sign for the front gate, with the date that Grandma and Grandpa first opened the doors at Savern Vineyards. Oh, it's beautiful, Jenna. Mom and Dad, I know Grandma Ellie would be so proud of everything you've done here. Well, we just love what we get to do, and doing it together. Oh, and we have one more surprise. Oh. That looks nice. Oh, Jenna. We thought this was lost years ago. Marcelo found it. He fixed the frame. Thank you, Jenna. I love you. Glad you love it. I'm so glad you love it. One more day left in Carington. Ready to go back? I'm going to miss the sense of community here. That's for sure. I'm going to miss you. You know, I'm not too far away. I know. This cake is amazing. Pumpkin spice makes everything better. What about pumpkin spice wine? Okay, maybe not everything. Right. Want to dance? Absolutely. As long as you're okay with... Please don't do that in front of people again. Come on. It's too late. - Let's go. - All right. You know... dancing always makes me feel better. Okay. Are you nervous for the competition tomorrow? Mm-hmm. Good. It's good. It's good for you. You know, I was thinking that the wine... could be called... "The Heart", because you poured your whole heart into it. El Corazón. Even better. To honor where you're from. I like it, but how about "Maestra del Corazón"? "Master... of the Heart". To honor you. A little bird told me you were upset. Don't worry about me. Of course, I'm worried about you. You're my little girl. What happened with Aidan? His sommelier quit. He needs to hire a new one, but they only hire master somms at Alluvial, so... Well, you're going to be one in a few weeks. Well, everyone thinks so. Except Aidan. What do you think? I... I don't know. Jenna... come and sit down for a minute. I'm going to tell you something your grandmother told me. A relationship is like a vineyard. You plant it, you water it, you nurture it... but you only get out of it what you put in. But it takes love for it to thrive. We've been together so long, I... I thought I loved him. But... how does he not know how much this means to me? If that is your dream, maybe you should be in on it together. Here you are. Enjoy. Thank you. Here... Aidan. Hey, sweetie. - How are you doing? - Oh, hey. What are you doing here? I came to support you. - Um... - Aidan. Marcelo. Nice to meet you. Oh, I've heard great things about your wine. I've heard great things about your restaurant. I... I thought you weren't coming. Hey. You're holding up the line. We will talk later. Try this, please. It's... it's Marcelo's wine. Oh. What do you think? It's, uh... definitely unique. This wine is going to be the next big thing. I'm sure it will be. All participants in the wine competition, please report to the main stage. We will start in five minutes. I guess we'll find out. I'll see you over there. Welcome to the main event... The Carington Wine Competition. This event has grown from a small local festival to a premier wine competition, showcasing some of the best wine in the Sonoma and Napa regions. The judges have informed me that they have selected their winners with great difficulty. Every one of you has created something with passion and heart. And for that alone, you should all be celebrated. So, without further ado, third place in the Harvest Festival Wine Competition goes to... the Princess Pinot Noir, Chateau d'Entremont. Yeah. That's okay. That's okay. And second place goes to... the Firecracker Merlot, Zellar Creek. And first place... Oh, from our very own town of Carington, California... Apple of Eden Cabernet from Davrow Farms! Congratulations to all our participants, and would representatives from each of our winning vineyards please come on up to the stage? Everyone else, enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Keep drinking wine. Nothing? I can't believe it. I really thought we were going to win. You okay? Yeah... better than I thought I would be. I'm really glad we did this. You are? Yeah. Hello, I'm Jennifer. Jennifer. Ah, hello. Hello. I'm Jenna Savern. It is an honor to meet you. Jennifer, hi. Aidan Parker. You've been to my restaurant in San Francisco. Alluvial? Oh, of course. Aidan. And you must be Marcelo Castillo. Yeah. A pleasure to meet you. I wanted to come and speak to you personally. I tried your wine today, and it was fantastic. It was daring. It was original and creative. Thank you. You know, not all of the judges are on board with organic wine, but I really think you're on to something. Wow. And if, on the off chance, you'd like to move to Australia, there's a position open at our estate in Yarra Valley. This is my personal number. Don't take too long to think about it. Thank you. Incredible. Wait, this is better than winning. Jennifer Huether wants to work with you. In Australia. I know. Hey, you should go talk to her now. No, no. She's... Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is your moment. You should go. Now. There. Go, go, go, go. Um, Miss Huether? Oh, you can call me Jennifer. Okay, um, Jennifer. I'm taking my master sommelier exam in two weeks, and I wanted to ask if you had any advice. I'm a huge admirer. I think, really, the best advice I could give you is to go ready, prepared and open, and really present. Put your fears aside and be there and enjoy it. Not many women make it as far as you do. We need to stick together and push each other forward. Go get 'em, Jenna. Aidan, can we talk for a minute? Yeah, sure. So what really brought you here today? Your dad called me. I'm sorry. Missing the party was a huge mistake. I don't know how I'm going to make it up to you, but I hope I can. Aidan, I want to be considered for the job. I'm ready. If you needed proof that my palate was good, well... now you have it. I shouldn't have doubted you. Right. You could've trusted me. In two weeks, there's a very good chance I will be a master sommelier, but either way... I want the job. To Marcelo, the man of the hour. Please. I haven't accepted the position yet. Oh, well, don't hold back on our account. You have taken our vineyard to the next level, and we couldn't be more grateful. I'll drink to that. Cheers! Cheers. Cheers! Ahem. And to Jenna, our new head sommelier at Alluvial. - Wow. - Congratulations. Aidan! Oh, my gosh, thank you. Congratulations. - That's wonderful. - Thank you! Jenna, that's amazing. Congratulations. You deserve it. Okay, I'm going to let you celebrate as a family. I have things... in the morning in the vineyard, so thank you. Of course. You probably need to get some rest. Goodnight, everyone. Goodnight. I'll be right back. Wait! Wait. I, um... I just wanted to say thank you... for everything. Are you really going to Australia? It's a fantastic opportunity. I learned a lot from you. I learned a lot from you, too. I'm going to miss you. Yeah. I'll miss you, too. Oh, would you take table four? Good evening. And here we are. The Maestra del Corazón. Is it good? Mm... wonderful. I'd never steer you wrong. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, hey. Remember to upsell, and we've got that Rioja Gran Reserva. Which I love, but it wouldn't go with the meals they ordered. Fair enough. Oh! Just a reminder. I'm leaving early tonight to study. Uh, but you're still coming in tomorrow? We just booked a reservation for a party of 10. The day before the test? Jenna, we're overbooked, okay? I need my somm. I'll be here first thing. Okay. Enjoy your night off. Thanks. Hey, you. How's the restaurant? Um, it's fine. Just fine? Hey, have you... have you heard from Marcelo recently? Well, he's moving to Australia. He took the job? That's great. That's, um, that's really great. You need to call him. It's okay. - Jenna! - I will call you after the test. All right. Crossing my fingers. Fingers and toes. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Uh... what's all this? This is our new pinot noir. Never heard of it. Oh, it's going to make a huge splash, and we're the first to serve it. Don't I have a say in this? Well, I thought it was my job to make the wine list. I just want to be sure you're doing what's best for the restaurant. I am here, aren't I? The day before the biggest exam of my life. You know you have your job either way, right? And hasn't it always been your goal to work here? No... No. Maybe it was my goal at one point to work at a prestigious restaurant. But I think... I'm learning to dream bigger. I don't understand. I want something that feels like... like what my parents have. Two people in love, building something together as equals. But you have never believed in me. I am not taking this test to impress you. I'm taking it for me. It kind of feels like we're breaking up. I do love you, Aidan. But I think maybe we've always had different dreams. I'm so sorry. Jenna. Good luck on the test. Well, I guess this is it. We're sad to see you go. But you really set us on the right path. Thank you. You sure did. We are going to miss you, Marcelo. I'll miss you. - Thank you. - Okay. Flight 817 from Miami now arriving at gate B7. Welcome back, Miss Savern. How are you feeling? Excited to be back, thank you. You have 30 minutes to identify all six wines. Good luck. This smells like the ocean on a foggy morning. Assyrtiko, Santorini, Greece. 2020. Flavors of stardust apple and slate. Riesling. Finger Lakes, New York, USA, 2019. Miss Savern, do you have an answer? Strong, full-bodied. It's perfectly balanced. This is a high-altitude natural Tannat from Mendoza, 2015. Argentina. Cheers! I'm proud to welcome you as a fellow master sommelier. Congratulations, Jenna. Thank you so much. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. You're here! I thought... I couldn't miss your big moment. Ceibo flowers? Yeah. You really can find anything in this city. They match my new pin. It looks good on you. Your grandmother would be so proud. Let's get out of here. Yeah. I have something to tell you. Okay, I spoke to your dad's friend, Gil, and he's willing to sell me his vineyard. Yeah, I would have to take out a loan, and he said he's been waiting to sell to the right person. And you would do that over moving to Australia? I was hoping to have a master sommelier by my side. - But if it's a lot of pressure... - No, no, no. - No. - No? Tell me everything. We would be equals. Partners. I'd make the wine, you'd handle the business. Of course, you'd have a say in every decision we make. Every decision, every plan, everything. We'd make it together. Home is not a place. It's a... feeling. And for me, I think it's a person, too. Jenna... you're my home. I want you to come with me. Yes. - Yes? - Yes! Yes? It sounds like a dream. Te quiero, Jenna. I love you. Te quiero, Marcelo.
