[horse whinnies] [people clamoring] [bull mooing] [crowd chattering] That's a nice bull. All right. -[woman screams] -[yelling] [snorts] [grunts] [dog barking] Bobby! [bull snorts] [whimpers] [woman screams] [Bobby whimpers] [bull groans] [whimpers] [whines] [whispering] Bobby, to the pen! To the pen! [whines] Good Bobby. Good boy. You stay back there! Come on. Come on. [horse whinnies] [moos] [John] Got ya! [cheers and applause] Good work there, lad. You did well. Good boy, Bobby. He's brave enough for the luck of you. I'd have to say that. Aye, he is. [John breathing heavily] I still say you'd be better off with a proper police dog. [laughs] Bobby does fine for me. Aye, well, you always had a soft spot for the runt of the litter. [both laughing] Are you sure you're not hurt? Just catching my breath. Move along! Nothing to see here. [crowd mutters] Here you go, boy. A wee present for saving my stall. That's good of you, would you mind giving it here? Aye. There you go, eh, Bobby. He won't mind all this, yeah? Aye. Since he was a pup. Ewan. Did you see Bobby? I thought the bull had got you there, John. Well, that was just luring him on! Oh, aye, is that a fact? Mind you, at that, at any moment you could have fitted between his horns. [chuckles] So how's Maureen? Uh, she's fine, thank you. Good, well, let's go home and get your tea, eh, Ewan. Come on, then, Ewan. Hey. Your mother's right. Off you go. Hey. I have my work to do here. Go on. Aye. [laughter] [congregation singing hymn] [all] ♪ Here his thoughts Are near ♪ ♪ He changeth thoughts And thou art dear ♪ ♪ Only believe And thou shalt see ♪ ♪ That Christ is all In all to thee ♪ [Lee] Please be seated. Let not change be feared by men with a pure heart. And that is what I want to talk to you about today. Change. The children I see, sitting before me, hold the key to ridding the old town here of the poverty and disease that have gripped it for generations. Only with the education of these young people will come the changes that are so badly needed. Changes to the atrocious conditions in the workplace. [congregation murmurs] Changes to the scandalous state of the shoddy and dangerous housing. Changes to the whole miserable standard of life here in the old town. [murmurs of agreement] Did you enjoy the service, Mr. Smithie? Run along. No, I did not, Reverend. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't believe you are, I don't believe you are at all. You see, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work. I have run my mill the same for 20 years, as did my father before me. My workers are perfectly happy, sir, believe me. Mr. Smithie, in the old town here, folk rise at 4:00 in the morning, they work a 15-hour day, and are fortunate if they live to see their 40th birthday. Would you call them happy? Fascinating. Good day, sir. Children as young as eight are forced into work. The squalor they live in spreads cholera and tuberculosis. Oh, very interesting, Reverend, but I don't think the gates to the church are the place for such an outburst. Then where is, Mr. Johnson? I'm just trying to do some good here. And very commendable, too. But if you wish to stay in the parish, perhaps you should concentrate your efforts on something more traditional, like... A harvest festival. There's nothing like an impressive array of root vegetables to cheer up a congregation. That man is poison, Mr. Gray. Aye. What, him, Mr. Smithie, and plenty more like him. They'll not listen while they're making money off the workers' backs. [Lee] Aye. [indistinct talking] Well, I hope you don't mind me asking, but, well, I thought I knew my Bible well, but I cannot recall exactly where Jesus gave us his thoughts about change. Aye, well, you'll maybe not have seen them, no, they were in His monthly newsletter. [Bobby barking] [Ewan laughing] [John] He beat me. I think they made the hill steeper. Look at this town at night. [wind whooshing] You can hear the ghosts talking amongst themselves. -Ghosts? -Aye. Chattering away about something or nothing. You know, there are more ghosts here in Edinburgh than in the whole of the rest of the British Isles put together, did you know that? -No. -Aye. It's a fact. [wind howling] Didn't you hear them? What's that they say? [shouts] Will you hold your noise now, please? [wind dies down] They stopped! Aye. Aye. [woofs] I saw young Ewan today. -Mmm? -Aye, he's growing up fast. I offered to help with his reading-- He'll be the breadwinner soon enough, there's no time for any reading. There's always time for reading, Maureen. I mean, Ewan, he's a bright boy, too bright to waste away in the mill. They need food on the table like everyone else. Yeah, but if the bairns could read and write, then they could do better than that factory-- Factories or the poorhouse. Yes, we know. Watch out, Bobby, he's on his soapbox again. And what if I am? I thought that was what you liked about me, my passion! [giggling] Get away with you, unless you want some hodgepodge! Nothing wrong with a man being passionate! [both laughing] [coughs] [whimpers] Sit down. [coughing continues] Breathe this. [whines] John, have you seen a doctor like you said? Aye. I'm fine. I'm just a wee bit tired, that's all. Is that what he told you? [coughs] No, no. He used a lot of long medical words, but that's all it amounts to. [John coughing] [mouthing] [rooster crowing] [chain rattling] [Ada] Hello? Is there somebody there? [chain rattling] [squeaking] [screams] No! No! -Are you all right, Ada? -No! Please! [John] Stop! [groaning] [both grunting] [choking] [gasping] [barking] No! [Bobby yelping] [Bobby whimpering] [John] Bobby. Bobby! Bobby! [man] Hey! [chickens clucking] Bobby! [knocking on door] Bobby! [whines] [softly] You're all right, you're all right. The vet says he'll make a full recovery. But there's always a danger of infection, so the wound needs... covering. [John] Ewan. [Ewan] Yeah? It's only the afternoon, Mr. Gray! [chuckles] Aye, I know. I am just a wee bit tired. You should have seen Bobby in the fight today. Ewan, come on away, let him get his rest, eh? No, the lad's no bother, Ada. You're a good man, John. Hey, look. Ah, now look who's come to see us. Hi. -Hi. -[Bobby whimpers] You've been the best friend a man could wish for. You make sure he's all right. You know what I mean. Will you make sure? He still gets his runs? Aye. Good lad. You know, I want you to have this as well. You know, there's some fine tales in this book. About men who rose above their circumstance, made a difference to the world. Good men. Here. Thank you. Are you in this book? [laughs] Lord, no. [laughing] No. The idea... No. I wasn't able to make enough of a difference. Hey, come on, best be off. Bobby's getting a mite restless. Better take him out for a wee walk. Not too far, mind. Should I take him up to the hill where the ghost is? Aye. Aye, up where the ghost is. Come on, boy! [wind whooshing] You can hear the ghosties too, can't you, boy? [woofs] Quiet, please! [wind howls] Hush now! [wind continues howling] Doesn't work for me. Bobby. What's the matter? [Bobby howling] [howling] [Lee] Because John Gray had a vision. [bell tolling] A vision of a better life for everyone living here, in the old town. He worked day in, day out, to achieve that goal. And now we can only pray that John's efforts were not in vain. And that in some way, he is still amongst us. Showing us the path to that better life. [indistinct conversations] [Ewan] Bobby! Bobby! You'll not find him, he's gone! [Bobby whimpering] He's gone. Pity's sake, Ewan. Can you not show some respect? Sit quiet. [grunts] [singing indistinctly] [whining] [singing indistinctly] ♪ Oh, I can see you, ratty ♪ I know you can see me ♪ I'm gonna break your nappa -♪ Just you wait and see! -[squeaking] ♪ All things great And beautiful ♪ ♪ All creatures great And small ♪ ♪ All things wise and... ♪ All things wise And wonderful ♪ [indistinct chatter] [clucking] [growling] Come on, bedtime, my sonny. Hmm? Ma, where do you think Bobby is? I think Bobby is curled up in front of a roaring fire somewhere, eh? Bedtime. [howls] [howls] [rooster crows] [man 1] Fresh bread! Fresh from the oven! Fresh bread! Fresh baked from the oven! [man 2] Fresh cut watercress! Strawberries and watercress. [man 1] Come and get your fresh bread! Fresh from the oven now. [merchants calling out] Coconuts, coconuts. They're lovely, all the way from the tropics. Come on now, last few left. Lucky coconuts. Cures all known diseases. Easy-to-open coconuts. A wee secret of the Orient, missus, a drop or two of coconut milk in your husband's tea, and you'll think he's 21 again. I'm not married. Aye, well, a drop or two in yours and you soon will be. And what do you want, with all your staring? You being a terrier and all, puts me in mind that you might be a police dog. 'Cause I've done nothing wrong yet. And that other time was a clear case of mistaken identity. They were just lying about. And I just picked them up to keep them safe. Do you like mutton pies? 'Cause I've got one left. Just in here. There. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bribe. More a gesture of good will. Good dog. Ewan, your ma promised my ma you'd look after me. So you can't run away. And anyway, what's the big hurry? Trying to find my dog. Your dog? But you don't have a dog. Hey, hey, hey. -[Bobby growling] -On your way, sir. [Bobby whimpers] Now, can you not read? It says, "No dogs." -[Bobby whimpering] -And stay clear. Go on! [barks] Will you not take a telling? [barking] [whimpers] There. That'll show you. Don't you even think about it. If I catch you in here again, I'll wring your neck. [gate slams shut] James, are the rats getting bigger, or was that a dog I saw running around earlier? Aye, sorry about that, Minister. He's a stubborn wee beggar. Every time I throw him out, he's right back in again. Any reason, do you think, why he's so keen on being close to God? No, sir. No idea. Well, we should admire his perseverance, if nothing else. Perhaps we should all take a lesson from our wee visitor about never giving up. I'm waiting for Mr. Smithie and Charity Commissioner Johnson. Old Money Bags and Misery, huh? Well, doesn't sound like a social visit to me. No, it's not. [Johnson] Reverend Lee, when you're ready, sir. Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smithie. Shall we go through to the vestry? I think we should, unless it's too miserable for you? What do you want, laddie? Well? I'm looking for a white terrier. Really? Give me a couple of days and I'll see what I can come up with. I'm looking for John Gray's terrier, Bobby. You mean Constable Gray? God rest. It so happens I can help you there, laddie. [Brown] Now, enough is enough. -Let's meet half way. -[whines] You'll not be harmed, but you're not biding here. -[barking] -Where you going? [squeak] Hey! Come here! What do you think you're doing, hey? Is this your dog? Because you should look after it better. Have you not got a voice in your head? -Hey! Huh? -He's not mine. All right. Now we're getting somewhere. So whose is he? He was John Gray's dog. What, Constable Gray that's buried here? [barks] Where are you going? [squeaking] Rats. Yes, well, I'm afraid they're everywhere. Well, they should not be in God's house. You are losing control, sir. A matter secular, as well as spiritual. -Whatever shall be next? -[barking] A dog? [squeaking] [barking and squeaking] [Brown chuckles] Does he always do that? James, how did that dog get back in here? I was about to throw him out once and for all and he ran away again. Just get him out of here. I would if I could catch the wee bleeder. [barks] Sexton, can you explain why you've let this place be overrun with wild animals? They're hardly wild animals, sir. My God, look, there are lots of dead rats everywhere. A dog. Dogs are not permitted on church land. -No, sir. -[Johnson] No. Then why does this animal seem to have the run of the place? Well? [wind howling] He catches the rats. Be quiet, boy. He catches the rats. I said be silent! He does, sir. The bairn's right, he catches the rats. And as such, he's a great asset to the church. The rules state no dogs. [Lee] They do. Heh, they do. But if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smithie, does not that fine gentlemen's club you belong to on Princess Street exclude ladies? Yes. Gentlemen's club. [Lee] But you do have women there doing the cleaning up and the cooking? Yes, but they're on the staff. Well, he's on the staff here. What? I was going to explain earlier, but I didn't get the chance, that I've employed, uh... -Bobby. -Bobby. ...Bobby, here as our rat catcher. As a what? As a rat catcher. He's, uh... He's very good at it. Very good. And he'll help to keep the graveyard safe for visitors. He demands no wages or shelter. So it will cost the church assembly nothing. Sounds like the Reverend's got you there, gentlemen. [crowd laughing] Great, sir. You haven't heard the last of me. Believe me. Bye, now. [man] Good day to you, Mr. Johnson. [all laughing] Wee troublemaker. [barking] I've never seen anything like it. He's the furry Eighth Wonder of the World. Well worth the trip to see him. He's been there for weeks now, praying. And would you believe it? He sleeps on his master's grave every single night. Come rain or shine, hail or wind. And he answers to nobody but meself. Give me a farthing and I'll show you if you like. Thank you, sir. Bobby, Bobby! Here boy. Come on, it's Tam. [clicks tongue] Come on! [Bobby growls] That's a terrier's way of showing affection. Ah, welcome to Greyfriars. A delight to see that Bobby has brought us some visitors from the new town. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind looking at this. -State of the old town. -[Tam] Coconuts. The atrocious conditions... Holy coconuts. Magical coconuts. Would you like some coconuts? It's that infernal dog. -[crowd laughing] -They're laughing at me out there. They are. You see? Doubt it has anything to do with you, Mr. Smithie. Oh, you doubt it, do you? And how do you account for that? I've had it pinned to my office door this morning. I didn't realize any of them could even write. No. You know, I've had two requests from the workers this week. Requests? Yes, the usual stuff. Nonsense, safety cages, a bit of lighting, that sort of thing. Before moving here, I believe that John Gray's widow was a shop girl in Dunbar. -Fascinating. -Mmm, well, perhaps it is, Mr. Smithie, because, uh... a word in the right quarter and I just might be able to remove this embarrassment. [Ewan] "Took his great army to... To..." That long word there, is that where he took his army? "And beat 20,000 soldiers led by... By..." There's another long word here. Somebody he beat. There's a picture of the man himself here, do you see? [barks softly] He was a great soldier from a long time ago, when they didn't have trousers. [breaths heavily] Ewan. I thought I'd find you here. I need to have a word with you. So you see, Ewan, it's a new start for me. I'm away back to Dunbar. Tomorrow. Apparently, I can have my old job at the hat shop, there. Oh, Ewan, darling, do you realize what I'm saying to you? I'll be taking Bobby with me. No! I must. I cannae just leave him. Ewan, he's... He's all I have left... of my John. [Bobby whimpering] All right, that's me. Now you'll have to stay here while I'm out at work. -[Bobby whimpers] -What? You'll have the run of the place. Oh, cheer up. Look here. I've left you some scraps in your bowl. I've cut them up into little pieces. Wish me luck. You have to stay here, mind. That's a good boy. You be good. [whines] [indistinct chatter] Will you not come and play with me? Go on. Ewan? [Brown] Go! Go on, you... Darn things. -For goodness sake. -[squeaking] Left to bother. [bird squawking] -[whimpering] -What is it? Eh? What is the matter? Bobby, come here. You know, you've scarce made a sound since we left Edinburgh. [barks] Aye, I know. Here. Go on. Do John proud. You take care of yourself. [Bobby barking] [thunder rumbling] -[honking] -[barks] [thunder rumbles] [sighs] Just mind yourself there, son, okay? That water is scalding hot. Not that you've got much to say for yourself, eh? [barks] [barks] [whines] [whimpers] [barks] Will you mind the splashing there, son? [wind blowing] Bobby? Bobby! -You're back! -[barking] Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! You came back. [all chanting] Bobby's back! Bobby's back! Bobby's back! [woman] Ada, it's your boy. What's he doing? Is something wrong? [chanting continues] [Ewan] Do you see that? Do you see who's here? I do. I do, son. Oh. Did... Did you hear them? Did you hear them shouting so loud? That's my son. That's... That's my Ewan. [barking] [Brown] Lord have mercy. Bobby! Is it you? Hey! [all clamoring] You walked all the way from Dunbar. Thirty miles or more. I don't know how you did it. I really don't. Improbable beastie. [Ewan] Are you back to stay, boy? [barking] [all cheering] [Bobby barking] James, I near filled my boots. Graveyards give me the creeps. [Bobby yelps] [barking] [Bobby continues barking] [whimpering] Good dog. Bobby. [Johnson] Take that cur down to the river and dispose of him once and for all. Mr. Johnson. I will not need to bother. The dog's broke its neck with the struggle. [yelps] You there! Have you seen a dog come by just now? What sort of a dog would that be? A terrier. -A terrier? -White. A white terrier? No, no, no. Definitely not. [barking] You see, I'd have said he was more of a light cream, myself. [chuckles] Ow! -Oh, Bobby! -[Ewan] Bobby! You're all right. [barking in distance] [Ewan] This way! Come on! [Johnson] Beggar! Don't lose him! [barks] [panting] No, Ewan, stop. That's Mary King's Close. It's full of ghosts. Just hurry up. Try not to think about it. But... But, Ewan! Mary King's Close. -Superstitious poppycock. -No. No. Sealed in 1645. Plague victims, hundreds of them, with no escape, buried alive. And when they came to open it half a century later... Good God, preserve us. A farthing? Mind you, it was a long time ago. [breathes shakily] [Mary screams] [Bobby barking] [Johnson] Give me the dog. No. Give me the dog. [Mary] No, Ewan. Please. Don't harm him. [whines] I'm so sorry. No! [Johnson yells] Devil! [ghostly snarls] No! No, no! [ghost moaning] [screaming] Did I frighten you? Tam! I thought you were a ghost! Aye, well, that was the general effect I was after. The Headless Highwayman is my personal favorite. Although, 'round here, I usually do the entombed plague victim. But I couldn't get any chains at such short notice. You see, our policemen are a wee bit superstitious. It's helped me out of an embarrassing situation from time to time. [Lee] So you think Mr. Johnson was actually trying to harm Bobby? [Ewan] Definitely. [Brown] Well, I don't like to speak badly of people, but he's an evil man who should roast horribly in the flames of hell. [cannon blast] That gunman is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. Every day, one o'clock. We're all going to die of heart failure. My ma says it's to tell the soldiers their dinner's ready. Bobby! Where you going? Whoa! Sorry, laddie, you cannae go in there. Hello, wee boy! [laughs] You're the famous wee dog from the kirk! Are you not? [barks] Ah, you're a bonny-looking wee man. What do you say we take you to the mess? For some real soldier's bully beef, hey? [laughs] Go on. [cannon blast] Those perishing soldiers. They're feeding that dog too much good beef, he'll not so much as look at a rat. That's the fourth day now. Well, I'm damned if I'll stand here and let outsiders poach our Bobby away from us. What are we gonna do, Mr. Brown? I'll get my visiting hat. Your intentions are very well, Sergeant Scott, but, uh... you're leading the wee beastie astray. Turning his head. You'll surely not begrudge him his dinner. Well, he eats with us. He's our dog. I heard he was no man's dog. His owner died and since then, he'll answer to no one person. -Aye, but-- -It would seem to me that since he belongs to no one in particular, he belongs to the whole of Edinburgh. -What do you mean? -I mean that you're the guardians of the most famous dog in the land. -You don't think... -Beyond a doubt. And all I ask is the honor of giving the wee fella a good feed, should he choose to come by. Well, as guardian of the most famous dog in the land... What do you think, Ewan? I say aye. Well, as long as it's Bobby's fancy to do so, I won't gainsay it. But you make sure you don't detain him after nightfall. I'm not gonna bide up all hours to open the gate to him. You have my word of honor, sir. [chuckles] I told him, eh? Eh? [laughs] [Smithie] It's a very difficult time. We have 20 people for every vacancy. Oh, please, Mr. Smithie, I understand that. But, well, I've been working here since I was no more than his age and... And he's my son. Does that not count for anything? Ewan. Tell me, Ewan, are you the, uh, wee lad looks after that dog, down at Greyfriars? Huh? Well, you do understand that if you did work here, the days would be long and the work, very hard. Six days a week, 12 hours a day. No time for any shenanigans with that animal. Ewan, will you answer Mr. Smithie? I shall. Good. Very good. But who'll take Bobby for his runs? Bobby can run perfectly well by himself. [Smithie] That's right. You listen to your mother. Now, Ewan, you run along home, because I have a few details I need to discuss... with your mother. Go on now, sonny, go home. I'll be back soon with your tea. [creaking] [whimpers] [creaking continues] [rumbling] [screaming in distance] What's that? Who's that, Bobby, eh? [crowd shouting] [woman] The whole building's come down! [people screaming] [crashing] Have you seen Ewan? Get back to your mother, Mary! -[Mary] Mother, Ewan's in there! -[Brown] Ewan! -[Bobby whimpering] -Bobby! Bobby, what is it? [people clamoring] [Brown] Ewan! Ewan! Is he there, Bobby? [barks] Come on, son. Come on! He's not breathing! Help me! [Ewan groans] Come on, son! Come on! [Ewan] My book! My book, my book! Where's my book? Is this what you want? [Ewan whimpers] It's gonna come down! [Bobby whimpers] What's happened? Where's my ma? [Brown] There's been a terrible accident. Your whole building... I'm afraid your poor mother... [sobbing] But she cannae be, she cannae be. I'm so sorry. [Ewan sobbing] [whimpers] [Smithie] The boy's far too young to be of any real use here, Reverend. You see, what I need is trained people. [Brown] Can you not give him a chance, sir? It was a terrible accident. 110 souls lost. Thank you. I'm fully aware of the extent of the disaster. I must have lost at least 20 of my workforce. Production is down 16%. Besides, I only took the boy on in the first place as a favor to his mother. No, I'm sorry, Reverend. That's my final word. Your charity will be rewarded in heaven, sir. Good day. [Brown] Surely there must be someone in the parish who can take him in. [Lee] Och, man, who? You've had the goodness to keep him this fortnight past. I'd be happy to keep him longer. No, no, James, no. You've neither the space nor the money. Nor does anyone 'round here. Is this all we can do? We're satisfied, young man, that you are genuinely destitute and orphaned. You are therefore to be admitted forthwith to this, the Cowgate Poorhouse. Here to remain until such time as you are of an age to earn your own independent living. Or as we see fit. I think we should start the boy on oakum picking. I believe Master Adams here should learn his lesson. [door slams shut] [sobbing] [guard] Hold down that sniveling in there! If you do not stop that row in there, boy, I will really come in there and give you something to blub about! [Ewan whimpers] [muffled sobbing] [barking] [continues sobbing] Sit there. All right. I want every fiber of this rope ripped out. And you will not move until it is all done. And if you have a mind to moan about it, I will take what is left and I will use it. Understand me? Good. [man 1] Come on, stop your tongue and work, will ya? [man 2] You there, stop talking! Bobby! [Brown] Every week, they make up some... story, so I cannae see him. I checked with one of the warders, he said that... that Johnson... he won't let him out. Treats him like a prisoner. Well, he has no kin. So no one has any legal right. No. But we'll keep trying, eh? Aye. [door opens] You've been with us a month now, have you not, Adams? Don't know, sir. It is customary, after a month, to allow the children their day's outing. I expect you'd want to be off down to Greyfriars, hmm? See the dog. Give him a run, hmm? Show him off to everyone. Aye, sir. That's exactly why you're not going to be allowed out. Now, tidy up this room for me. Start with the books. Boy. I want you to clean up here every day after you finish your other work. Aye, sir. Every day, sir. [whimpers] [door opens] [guard] Roger Priest! Settle down! Keep together, now. [woofs] [wind blowing] [whimpers] [barks] [barking] Bobby? Bobby! [barks] You found me! I knew you would! Shh! They'll hear you. Bobby! Shh! I can't come out. They won't let me. What's the matter? Are you all right? [barks] Oh. You're a wee genius. [Ewan moaning] Quiet in there! [moaning continues] You all right, boy? Oh! Get back here, come back here, boy! Come back here, Adams! -Did a boy come past you? -No. Well, come up here and help me find him. [barking] Get off! Get off of me! Get off me! -Get off! -[Bobby growls] [screams] [guard] Come back! [groans] [Bobby barking] [Ewan] Where are we going? Bobby! What are you doing? [whimpering] [barking] Bobby! You'll wake everyone. [door unlocking] Bobby? Ewan? Mary? [Mary] It's Ewan! Ewan! Oh, my God! [dog barking in distance] I'm sorry to wake you... Is this where you live now? What's happened to you? I just got... Do you think I could bother you for a drink of water, Mrs. MacPherson? Come inside, laddie. Oh, you're skin and bone. [barks] [Brown] Hush, Bobby. [carriage approaching] Ewan! Hello, Mr. Brown. -You're out! -Aye, I am. Well... Have you ever seen such a smart wee thing, eh? [laughs] I'm working for Mary's dad now. Is that a fact? A butcher's boy, eh. -Aye. -Aye, first day. [Brown chuckles] You come here. -[Ewan] You all right there, Mr. Brown? -Aye, aye, aye. Just... something in my eye there. Come on, come on. Well, there's been a few changes. Remember Sergeant Scott up in the castle there? Well, his regiment has gone to India. India, a subcontinent, rainfall 55 inches a year. -Where did you get that? -I learned it in a book. Two hundred million people live there, and their favorite food is rice. Yeah. That's foreigners for you, eh? Back here in Edinburgh-- Edinburgh, 150,000 people live there, and their rainfall is 26 inches a year. What? Edinburgh, 26 inches of rain a year. Was it only books on rain in that place? No, no, no, no. They have all sorts. I'm glad to hear it. Now, before you tell me with all your new learning what I'm going to have for my dinner. -Sorry. -[Brown chuckles] Bobby is even more famous than ever. We got folk from the new town coming down here every day to see him, and the minister tells them how bad it is here. And there's talk that we might be getting real drains. And it's driving Money Bags and Misery to drink! [laughs] [Smithie] "New Dog Licensing Act. Streets be cleared of strays. All owners to register their animals." All owners? [Johnson] So... Greyfriars Bobby, your owner will have some difficulty registering you. Short of a miracle. [thunder cracking] [Bobby barking] [growling] Hey! Stop it! What do you think you're doing? Eh? Their duty, sir. They're dog catchers. Carry on, gentlemen. [barking] [Lee] Explain yourselves! This is consecrated ground! Well? The Dog Licensing Act, sir. You're harboring a stray animal. What you talking about, man? What is this nonsense? [Johnson] It's the law. Well done that, man. Oh, your attention is to be drawn to paragraph eight. [Lee] "Every person in whose custody, charge or possession, or in whose house or premises, any dog shall be found or seen shall be deemed to be the person who shall keep such a dog." Look, enough of your blathering, just tell me in plain English, sir! The dog's abode is Greyfriars, but you are not its master. Neither are you. His master's dead. -But, sir! -[thunder cracking] Tomorrow at noon, if John Gray doesn't appear, the Burrough Court will claim ownership, the animal will be destroyed. -Executed. -[Bobby whimpering] [Brown] John Gray is dead, and you know he's dead. And kindly inform Mr. Gray that he shall also be answerable for a seven shilling license. Good day to you. [crowd] No! No! No! [crowd screaming] [dogs barking in distance] [dogs barking] [dogs howling] Ewan! Ewan! [Lee] I could not stop him. Johnson has the law on his side. [Mary] I hate that man. It's barely more than hour before noon. Nothing less than the ghost of John Gray can save Bobby now. [birds chirping] Do you remember what Sergeant Scott said that time we went up to the castle, Mr. Brown? What, about his dinner? No, that Bobby belonged to the whole of Edinburgh. [Brown chuckling] Aye, he did. In the poorhouse, I read a book. Oh, here we go. Be something about rain. [Ewan] No, it was the history of Edinburgh. There is someone who can help. He's not just our Bobby. [Lee] Who do you think can help? [Mary] Ewan! Where are you going? [door closes] [clock ticking] [mouthing] What are you doing? Just trying to see the Lord Provost, sir. Do you have an appointment? No, they're going to kill Bobby! He can't see you without an appointment. Now, if you would care to contact-- Oh, no, you don't. [Judge] Next, animal number 17. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, -it shall be poisoned until dead. -[gavel banging] Next. Animal number 18. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, -it shall be poisoned until dead. -[gavel bangs] Bobby's number 44. He had it on his collar. [wind whooshing] [indistinct chatter] Where you off to, laddie? MacPherson's Butchers. Some cow's livers, the best. [Judge] And so we shall proceed to animal number 27. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, it shall be poisoned until dead. [Sir William] Enter. [door creaking] Please, sir, I don't have an appointment, but I have to tell you about an injustice being done to the whole city. I thought it was you. Come here! I'm sorry, Sir William. I have no idea how this boy get in here. I've thrown him out once already. -They're going to kill Bobby! -Who's Bobby? -A dog, sir. -How dare you bother the Lord Provost about your stupid dog! He's not my dog, he's everyone's dog! Sergeant Scott said so! He's your dog, sir! Ah! If I don't get him back, then they're going to kill him! Get him out of here, Constable. They're going to kill Bobby! Animal number 41. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, it shall be poisoned until dead. Animal number 42. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, -it shall be poisoned until dead. -[gavel bangs] Next, animal number 43. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, it shall be poisoned until dead. Animal number 44. -[crowd yelling] -Order! [crowd protesting] Free the wee dog! [Judge] Order! Order in court! [protesting stops] One more such outburst, and I'll charge you with contempt! -Shows them. -Yeah. [Judge clears throat] Animal number 44. Since no legally recognized owner has come forward to register the dog, -he shall be poisoned until-- -[dog barking] What on earth? Who let that animal in here? I did, Your Honor. Why, Sir William. [Judge] Uh... What brings you to our courtroom, sir? A dog, Your Honor. Nothing more than a simple, little dog. This one, to be precise. [whimpering] Please. His name is Bobby, and he lives within the burial grounds of Greyfriars Church, where he can be found standing guard over his master's grave. I believe you know him as number 44. Well, I, uh... 44. I agree that the streets of Edinburgh should be cleared of any dangerous or diseased animals. However, this dog is not diseased, Your Honor. And I'm given to understand he's not dangerous to anyone. Unless, of course, they happen to be a rodent. [crowd laughing] You tell him, big man! Order, order! Be that as it may, Sir William, the dog is a stray, and, therefore, in the eyes of the law, he must be punished. [Sir William] "A stray"? Defined as an ownerless, domestic animal. I should know, I published a dictionary. But how can Bobby be ownerless if he lives in Greyfriars Kirk? -Who runs the kirk? -Well, the city council. -Who controls the council? -The Lord Provost. -Who is the Lord Provost? -Why, you are, sir. So, who owns the dog? Why, you do, Sir William. With apologies for the delay. [crowd] Hurray! [man] Good on you, Sir William! -[gavel banging] -[Judge] Order! -Silence in court! -[crowd shouting] Excuse me, Your Honor. Sir William... Charity Commissioner Johnson, you have something to add to this case? I was wondering whether, under the strict interpretation of the law, whether Sir William could solemnly swear that the dog would, at all times, remain within the confines of Greyfriars churchyard. -'Course he can! Tell him so! -[Judge] Silence! I will not warn you again. Well, Sir William, can you make such a guarantee? -No, Your Honor. -No. No, I... I thought not. I'm sorry. How can I? This dog cannot be confined or contained. Such is his spirit of independence, he deserves the freedom of the whole city. [Johnson] Hmm. Uh, I might also add that, under the city council rules, no dogs are allowed in the churchyard, anyway, so, this court can hardly confine a dog to a place where it is not permitted. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I will decide what the court thinks. 'Course. I apologize, Your Honor. Sir William, I don't want to appear the villain of this piece. [whispers] What's the matter with you? [whispers] I need to get this paper to the Lord Provost, there. [Judge murmuring] A stray dog is a stray dog. And the law is the law. -Is it important? -Aye. [Judge talking faintly] Well, you're not a wee boy anymore... you're big enough to stand up for yourself. [Judge] So, -So that's that. -[Johnson] Yep. In the case of animal number 44... If you need to say something, then you say it. [Judge] ...as no legally recognized owner has come forward... You make yourself heard, Ewan Adams. ...he shall be poisoned until-- Sir William! Sir William! [Judge] What is this? Constable, I will not have my court interrupted-- Now, one moment, Your Honor. Please, one moment. Uh, Constable, would you, uh... Thank you. [Judge] You... You have something? Your Honor, I would like to read a list of names, if you would indulge me. Aye, aye. "Robert Adam, Sir Walter Scott, John McAdam, Robert Burns." All great men of Edinburgh, great men of history, of Scotland, spelled with two T's, by the way, not one. Sorry. [clears throat] Whether there are two T's or not, what have the great heroes of this city got to do with the case of a stray dog? Well, Your Honor, thanks to a young lad's love of books, these names remind me that I still have one option... to save Bobby. [whimpering] [Sir William] It is, therefore, with the greatest pleasure, that I confer upon him an honor not lightly bestowed, and shared with the great achievers of history. Bobby, I grant you the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. [crowd applauding] [wind whooshing] [crowd cheering] [Bobby barking] A freedom, it seems, that he's intent upon grasping with both paws. [crowd laughing] -Oh, I see that Bobby wishes his friends could join us. -[barks] And who are we to disobey a free person of the city of Edinburgh? Thanks, Bobby. Sexton. [indistinct chatter] Is that a cold you have there? You won't get much of a blow with that wee scrap of lace. Would you like to go with mine? -[Lee] Mrs. Gray -Ada. Mary, you look beautiful. Oh, Bobby! -You look fine. You look fine. -[Bobby whimpering] John would've been proud of you. Mrs. Gray, would you have this? It saved Bobby, and maybe me. I think Mr. Gray would want you to have it back now. Thank you, Ewan. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ewan, I feel justly humbled by what I have seen in the old town today. Something must be done. Something will be done. There is no reason why the old town should not blossom from the seeds nurtured in this churchyard. As a first step, I offer you, Ewan, my lad, an apprenticeship in my publishing house, Chambers and Company. So, what do you say to that, will you take the chance? Aye, sir! I will. Thank you. And I vow that every citizen of Edinburgh will be guaranteed the opportunity to show the good that is in them all. -[crowd clapping and cheering] -Praise! [Lee] Thank you, God! Would you care to see all the good I have in me? [Bobby barking] [urine trickling] -[Bobby barking] -[crowd laughing and cheering] [barking] [all] Hip, hip, hooray! [Sir William] In the end, John Gray was wrong. He and Bobby were able to make a difference, and leave the world a better place. And so, after another 11 years' loyal service, still refusing ever to leave his master's side, Greyfriars Bobby lay on John Gray's breast one last time, closed his eyes, and finally, went to sleep. ♪ Slowly I wake ♪ The sun fills the room And I am back ♪ ♪ Here in The real world again ♪ ♪ Leaving behind The sound of our laughter ♪ ♪ In long Long sunny days without end ♪ ♪ Only moments ago Life was still Just so sublime ♪ ♪ In dreams where we're still Together all the time ♪ ♪ It hurts to believe that ♪ It never will be so again ♪ But how sweet the memory ♪ That lights up my nights ♪ So although you are gone ♪ You will live on With me here ♪ ♪ Inside ♪ Where is the world ♪ Where is the world That we knew? ♪ ♪ How can it just Cease to be? ♪ ♪ Where is that life ♪ The life that I knew In my heart ♪ ♪ That led to my destiny ♪ In another life All my tomorrow's I could see ♪ ♪ But now there is So much uncertainty ♪ ♪ And all that I know is ♪ I'm lost and alone Without you ♪ ♪ But how sweet the memory ♪ That lights up my life ♪ So although you are gone ♪ You will live on With me here ♪ ♪ Inside ♪ Although you are gone ♪ You will live on With me here ♪ ♪ Inside
