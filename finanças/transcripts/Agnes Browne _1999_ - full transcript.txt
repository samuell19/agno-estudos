If you're stuck, I have a spare shilling or two, Aggie. There's only Tommo and me. Ah, you're very good, Marion. I'm all right. I'll manage. Once I get over Cathy's Communion and Christmas. Agnes. - What? - Ah, nothin'. What, Marion? You were going to say something. What was it? Do you miss it? What? Miss what? Ah, you know. It. The queer thing? - No. - Are you serious? What's to bleedin' miss? The smell of chips and Guinness bein' breathed all over ya? And his chin like fuckin' sandpaper rubbin' up on your neck? No. Ah, now, you can't say you never enjoyed it, Agnes. Marion, will you get a grip? Enjoyed what? You know, the organism. I never done one. I don't think they exist. They do. I swear, Agnes, they do. I done two. Organisms? When? One a couple of weeks after your Redser's funeral, of a Friday, and one last August. Jesus! What were they like? Well, needless to say, he was drunk. There he was, bouncing up and down, up and down, up and down-- I know-- I know that bit. Get to the point. Ah, right. I'm thinking to meself, "If this fellow doesn't evacuate soon, I'll fall asleep." Suddenly, a feeling came over me. It was like... gettin' 10 early numbers in the bingo, and you just know something good is coming. Next thing, it was like an explosion. I could see colors burstin' in me mind, like someone set off fireworks. Me hips started jerkin' all on their own. And suddenly, without me tellin' it to, me mouth let out a little yelp-- woo! Ah! Anyway, next thing, he stopped and said, "Sorry, love. I didn't mean to hurt ya." "Keep goin'," I kinda whispered. But he just went to sleep. So, I lay there. And I don't know why, but after a while, I started to cry. I wasn't sad or nothin'. I just cried. Gas, isn't it? - Did you tell him about it? - You're jokin'. He'd say I had fuckin' worms or something. - How long did they last? - Just a couple of seconds. Over in a flash. Geez. If they're that quick, I could've had one and never noticed it. Nah. Believe you me, Agnes, if you'd have had one, you'd have noticed for sure. Oh, look, a punter. Well, fuck you, Redser Browne. Seven children and not one organism to show for it. Isn't she absolutely beautiful? Look at her posing. - Do all kids go on like that? - Oh, yes, missus. Believe me, Irish girls know a dry run when they see one. - Are you happy, love? - Yeah, Mammy. It's gorgeous. - Well, you can thank your Auntie Marion. - Thanks, Auntie Marion. - You were a long time inside. - I know. I know. Here. I'll take that for you, Cathy. Isn't that beautiful? Gorgeous. It'd look great on you. I'd rather wear the money. It's lovely, isn't it, Mark? It's not a mammy's dress. Sure, look at the price. Our mam could never pay that. - Hello, Mrs. Browne. - Oh, hello. - You look lovely today. - Oh, thanks. Hello, Mrs. Monks. Bye. Hiya, Pierre. Didn't say I looked beautiful. Blind bastard. You be careful, Agnes. That fellow only wants to peel your celery. I've been in love so many times ♪ ♪ Thought I knew the score ♪ But now you've treated me so wrong ♪ ♪ I can't take any more ♪ And it looks like ♪ I'm never gonna fall ♪ In love Hmm! ♪ Again Mark, what are you doing up? I don't want to go back to school after the summer, Mammy. What do you want to do then? I don't know. I'll go get a job. Oh, yeah, a job here, a job there-- then back on the dole. - It's not good enough. - It was good enough for me da. You don't have to tell me. But it's not good enough for you. No, you're not leaving school till you get a trade like your Uncle Gonzo. I don't want to be a feckin' plumber. You watch your language, and I might remind you... your Uncle Gonzo only owns his own house. Yeah, well, you can't make me feckin' stay. What did I say about your language? Now feck off back to bed. I reckon those priests are fixing it. Nah. Just a run of bad luck. - Good night. - Good night. Bottle o' cider. And Guinness with black currant. My treat, girls. - God bless, Mr. Foley. - Thanks, Mr. Foley. Any luck tonight? Not at all. If it was raining soup, I'd be the one out there with the fork. Has that one asked you out yet? Jesus, Marion. I wouldn't be bothered with him or any of them. - I wouldn't. - Oh, you're mad. Maybe not him. You're only young. You could marry again, and you should. Would you feck off? What hero would take on seven children? Ah, you need a man. You know, I thought I would need a man. But I'll tell ya somethin'-- I don't. D'you have any more of them organisms? I knew you were going to ask me that. I wish I never told you. Ah, shut up. Well, did ya? No. I'm givin' them up. After two? Why? Not feelin' so good since I had 'em. I'm after gettin' a lump. Where? - There. - On your diddy? Agnes Browne, will ya keep your feckin' voice down? - What did Dr. Carson say it was? - What? Dr. feckin' Carson. What did he say? - I didn't go to him yet. - Why not? Because if it's on account of them organisms, I'd be scarlet with embarrassment. Will you not be stupid? I am not being stupid. - Ya are. - I am not. That's none of your business anyway. Ya make me sick sometimes, Agnes Browne. Do you know that? You always know it all. Well, it's my diddy, and it's my business! Fair enough. Keep your diddies to yourself. Know all! And what are youse looking at? Good morning, God. It's me, Marion. - Tuppence, please, love. - There you are. Thanks. Annie, where's Marion gone? Up to Dr. Carson's. Annie, would you mind keepin' an eye for an hour? Ah, Agnes, I'm already minding Marion's stall. I'm not on fuckin' skates. Ah, Please, Annie? Well, go on then. Agnes. Here. How are ya? Grand. What'd they do to ya? They performed... a lumpectomy... and a cervical biopsy. Well, you look marvelous. I think they cured ya. They're only tests, Agnes. Oh. - Do you know what they done to me? - What? - They shaved me. - Where? - Down there? - For feck's sake! Sorry. Give us a look. I will not. Give us a look. No! Oh, Marion Monks, I'm your friend. - Go away. - Give us a look. No. - Come on. Give us a look. - No. Oh, Jesus, Marion! You know what? It suits ya. - Good man, Mark. - Here.

Unfortunately, I am. - What is it you're making? - What I make... the maker doesn't want it, the buyer never uses it, the user never sees it. - What is it? - Uh, a coffin. You're mad. - Carpentry. That's a trade, isn't it? - Yep. - Ow! - Get away! Smelly bitch, ya. Apples! Get your apples! Four for a shilling! Just one, please. - Five for a shilling. - Very fresh. Five for a shilling.

Why would I have problems minding your measly little stall? So, tell us, how'd you get on? - Grand. - What does grand mean? The doctor said no need for any further tests. That's what he said, "No need." Isn't that great? Ah, Marion, it's fuckin' wonderful. It's fuckin' wonderful. Well, Mrs. Monks, I have good news as well. Have ya? And what is it?

I'm sure he's just being friendly, that's all. Oh, is that all? What did he give you? This. Well, all he gave me was this. Tommo could do better than that. Sorry to interrupt your fun, ladies. Have you got something for me, missus? Yes, I do, Mr. Billy. - That's two pound. - Thanks. And the 40 I owed you. That's 42. There's way too much there, love. It's all there, Mr. Billy. I just want the two pound. That's the deal. That was the deal. But now I'm paying it back. All of it. I've already given you the 16 pound in interest, and now you're all paid up in a lump sum. I'm finished. You're finished, all right. Don't you ever ask me for a loan again. Oh, I won't. Ever. I wanna play. You have no money. Yeah, I do. I just paid off Mr. Billy. Fair play. Thanks.

Yeah, well, they had a rough sailin' comin' from Jamaica. I'm gettin' them sunlamps at the weekend. Hey, Winnie, let's check them stalls. See you in a minute, Agnes. - Right. - My stall is closed. - Winnie. - Right. Your man looks like he's making his move. - I hope so. - I thought you didn't like him.

Help me open it? - Yeah. - All right. Oh, Mark. We all chipped in, Mam. Thanks. I love it. Yoo-hoo! Where is she? We'll give this Frenchy boy a run for his money. Right. Let's take off the cucumber. You're lucky she sliced it first. ♪ It's not unusual to be loved by anyone ♪ I don't know what you're laughing at, Winnie. You're used to radishes. - Open your eyes, Agnes. - What's that? It's orange juice for your eyes. It'll make 'em sparkle. Lean back. Ah, Jesus, Marion! I've gone blind! Let's see. Oh, my God, you'd better wear sunglasses, Agnes. ♪ It's not unusual to go out at anytime ♪ - Oh, you're gorgeous. - Don't touch me feckin' frock. - Mammy, you're beautiful. - Wow! ♪ If you should want to be loved by anyone ♪ ♪ It's not unusual, It happens every day ♪♪ - See youse later. - Have a great time. - See you, Mammy. - Enjoy yourself. - Have a good time, love. - Bye.

I would walk barefooted across the desert... to see such beauty as you are tonight. Now what did he say? He would walk on his bare-- Ah! He's fuckin' mad about her. Madame, your carriage awaits. For the kids. It's a sight, isn't it? It's very beautiful, like you. Thanks. It was a great night out. For me too. - Good night. - Don't go. ...with his tongue, and it felt like a hot sardine wriggling in me mouth. Felt kinda nice though. Oh, Jesus, Agnes. I wonder if a Frenchy organism's any different from a Tommo one. Will ya feck off? Oh, look, there's Dermot Flynn. I ain't seen him since they moved. Of course, when you can drive, you can live anywhere. I've been thinking about that, Marion. About what? About what you said, about learning to drive. Oh, that? I forgot about that. What about it? You're right. Am I, Agnes? You really think so? Yeah, yeah. Go on. Do it. I'm delighted you agree with it. The man at the driving school said he could take us... in a couple of weeks for the first one. Lovely. - What do you mean "us"? - Us. You and me. I'm not gettin' into a car on me own with a stranger. I'm not gettin' in with ya. Who'll be driving? I will. You can feck off. I'm not going to be your first victim. Ah, you'll be all right, Agnes. The car has controls on his side as well. It's bisexual. - No. - Ah, please, Agnes. No. No, no. Ah, no, Marion. You all right? Never mind about me. You watch the feckin' road. If I'd known you'd be like this, I wouldn't have let you come. Let me come? Watch it. Here's the constructor. What's he doing? He knows we're from the Jarrow. He's countin' the wheels. Oh, he doesn't like this. He wants a wank. Open the window. - What's he saying? - He wants to know if you're a widow. - No, I'm married. - Wind the knob. - What's he saying? - Something about his knob. - He does want a wank. - Pre-vert. I need to check the brake lights. Would you like to press the brake pedal? That is the accelerator, Mrs. Monks. - The middle one. - Oh. Thank you. Jesus, Would you look at the head on him. He looks like a big penis. Oh, stop, Agnes. I'll start laughing again. Go on, ask him his name. I bet you it's Dick. Go on. I bet ya. Right, Mrs. Monks. Oh, do call me Marion. Okay, Marion. And, um, what's your name? - Tom. - Oh. Tom O'Toole. You're drunk, both of ya. We are not. Are we, Marion? Marion? Marion? Marion! Marion. Marion. Come out. Come out. Excuse me. Even if the lesson is canceled, I still have to be paid. Call an ambulance now! There, there. There, there. Oh, no. Marion, Marion, Marion. No. There, there. There, there. We'll pray for her soul. Ah, no. We're on our own now, Aggie. Yeah. Agnes? Agnes. Come on. Get off me. Get off. Agnes. Agnes, please. Let me lead you home. I don't need anyone to lead me home. Here, hold this.

I'll pay you back, Mr. Billy. I swear I will. Of course you will. Everybody does. Now, then. Frankie Browne. Frankie Browne. Ah, there you go. Ten pound. Ten? I only borrowed six. - Interest. - Interest? - I'm not a charity, am I, Micko? - Nope. No charity, Mr. Billy. I'll get it. Only please give me time, Mr. Billy. I could always go and see your Mammy Browne. She'll pay me up right. No, I'll get it. I will. Please. I'm a reasonable man, Frankie. I'll tell ya what, um-- I'll give you till Christmas week-- the 22nd. That suit ya? Don't let me down, son. No, Mr. Billy. Frankie! You thievin' bastard! You bastard! I'll kill ya!

They protect each other. Go on. Go on to bed. Go on. What's this? What's this about, Frankie? Mammy, I'm in big trouble. I borrowed money off Mr. Billy. Jesus. Him and Micko are after me. He said he'd give me till the 22nd. I'm sorry. Oh, Frankie. I'm gonna have to sell the Tom Jones tickets, Marion, unless I get a miracle by 3:00 today. So, would you do us a favor, Marion? Would you ask God to drop a 50-pound note in me purse? I didn't think so. Feller over there thinks I'm crazy, Marion. See you next week. Anyone buyin' or sellin' tickets? Anyone buyin' or sellin' tickets? Wally, how much for two Tom Jones? A fiver. Here, Wally. Give us six. Thanks, Wally. Thanks all the same, Marion. That's only half what the kid owes me. You're Agnes Browne. You pay by the lump sum. I want me money, all of it, by tomorrow. I won't have it. Then I'll clear every stick from your little kip. Now good-bye, Mrs. Lump Sum. Why do you always show up when I'm cryin'? So Mr. Billy will take all your furniture? Ah, it's not so bad. You can always find somethin' to sit on. Here. Come here. I waited 20 years for my husband to come through. Then it took only about two months with Marion... to realize I'd lived without a best friend me whole life. So, I'm sorry, Pierre. I can't go back to being dependent on any man. All I have now is me kids. I have to make sure they grow up right. Frankie has to learn there are consequences. I don't want another Redser around me. Marion is your guardian angel, Agnes. Yeah? Yes. So, can I just be your best friend? Tom Jones arrived to huge crowds today... at the Shelbourne Hotel before-- - Here, Cathy. - I'm sorry, Mam. That's all right, love. - It's just a few tables and chairs. - Where's your wedding ring? You can't eat a wedding ring, Frankie. Never forget that. - What time's Mr. Billy comin'? - In a couple hours. - Everyone on the street's gonna be laughin' at us. - Da would have stopped him. Ma, will we stop them for ya? No. Youse are doing things my way till youse are men. Mark's taking you off to Tommo's. - And no fightin'. - Is that footsteps? - Don't let them in here. - Sit down, Frankie! - Get out of my way! - Sit down! Stop it! It's only a letter. It's probably another bill. What is it, Mam? - Mam, what's wrong? - What is it? Thank you, God. Thank you, Redser. Thank you, Marion. Mam, what-- What is it, Mam? It's £25. - From who? - Mam, that's great! From your da's union. Come on. Let's go. Let's go get it! Excuse me. - There you go. - We've no money. That's all right. They're free. Mr. O'Dwyer will be with you in a moment, okay? Okay. - Hey, Marko, look. Lifts. Will we have a go? - No. - You would like to go on a lift, wouldn't you, Rory? - Mm-hmm. - You're early! - No, you're late. Mark Browne? - Yeah, that's me. - Where's your mother? She couldn't come, but she sent me instead. No way can I give 25 pounds to a bunch of children. Mister, did you know my daddy? No, I don't know any of the kitchen porters. - Well, he knew you. - Did he now? Good. And he said you're a bollocks. - Hey! - This way! - Stop! Stop them! - Wait for me! - Wait up! - Press it! Get those brats! Gerry, you got the lower. Trevor, up the stairs! After them! - Make it stop. - I'm trying. I'm trying. It just won't stop. - It's Tom Jones. - Tom Jones.

Why didn't you run? We're the Brownes. We stick together. What's this, a fuckin' parade? Right. I've had enough of this shite. Jesus! Mark said you were a fan. Tom? Jesus, come in. Go for a spin. Oh. Excuse you. - Who owns the car? - Tom Jones. - What? - He's up there with Agnes. Look at him though. Will ya fuck off. Here they come. Ho-How are you, Tom?
