- John Peterson for Dr. Lewinsky. Well is he there? Yes, it is urgent. I want to know how the operation went. I want to know if she's okay. Canceled? I'll have the money there tomorrow. And print. Print data is compiling. Bio-printing will begin in 10 minutes. Can we check the laser alignment please? - Kayleigh. Do you think it'll work this time? Or it'll just collapse into a ball of guts like last time? - It'll work. The cell to hydrogel ratio was wrong last time. I submitted new calculations to Peterson and he took corrective action. - I've made dozens of recommendations to Peterson since we started this thing. He didn't take any of them on board. Must be true what they say. - What? - You're Peterson's favorite. Didn't he pick you out of your PhD class before you'd even completed your dissertation? - I took a leave of absence to join the program, but-- - You just have to flutter your eyelashes and Peterson comes running. You're always up in his control room. - That's not true, I-- - Kayleigh Ma, can you report to my control room please? Not now. Five minutes and counting. Close the chamber door, please. Phew. - Professor? - Three quarters of a million pounds every time this laser's switched on. - Yes. - Let's hope the print doesn't fail this time. - It won't. The revised ratio calculations were correct. I'm sure of it. - Let's hope so. - Was there anything else you wanted to? - Two minutes and counting. - Only I'd really like to see the build take place. - Well you can see it from here. Best seat in the house, and it's safer. I can lock down every door in the building from this terminal if anything happens. - I didn't join this project to play it safe, Professor. - Kayleigh. If your calculations are correct, we are about to create a creature that hasn't walked this earth for millions of years. It hasn't been born. It hasn't grown, it hasn't developed, it just suddenly is. We can't possibly know how it will respond. - We've discussed this. It probably won't even know how to stand up, how to move, how to eat. - Never underestimate the power of instinct. One minute and counting. - I'm going back to the hangar. - Kayleigh. - Well, here goes nothing. - It'll work. - What did Peterson want? - What? - Peterson, what did he want? - I'm not sure. - Come on, come on. Hold, hold! - It should be complete, but who's going to go in and take a look? - Me. - Amy, be careful! We don't know-- - Can't you give anyone else a chance to shine? She shouldn't be in there. - She shouldn't be in there. Somebody get her out of there, now! Close the barrier, now! Yes? Dr. Lewinsky, how is she? What? Dead? - Hey, you okay? Just a dream. - About the accident? Jesus, it's been three months, you've gotta talk to somebody. - I can't Jed, I signed a non-disclosure agreement. - It doesn't mean you can't talk to me about it. - You're the last person I can talk to. You're a journalist. You give away secrets for a living. - I just don't get it. I mean, it was just some industrial accident. You quit med school to take this project, you're away for months, I can't visit you, and then suddenly something happens and everybody gets fired. - I wasn't fired, the project was shut down. - Either way, you're out of work. You haven't even had your last paycheck. I'd be pissed if I were you. I'll get us some coffee. At least you didn't get hurt. - He always made sure I was safe. - What's that? - Nothing. - Still say you should sue their ass. Look, when I was back in the States I worked on this story about this guy who lost an arm working in a saw mill. The company didn't even wanna know until I got his picture on the front page of the newspaper, you know, one arm and all that. - I don't want to sue anyone, Jed. I wasn't hurt. - I know, I just think well, let's get down there and get some shots of the scene of the accident and let people know what happened. - It's a secure research facility, you'd never get inside. - You could though. It's obvious you still have issues with whatever it was that happened. You just need to go down there and talk to the guy. What was his name? - Professor Peterson. - That's right, Peterson. It was his project, right? He hand-picked you for it, right? And what now it's sorry we screwed up, goodbye? - I don't know. - It's just at least go and speak to Peterson and ask him for the money he owes you. - I've tried. The phone number doesn't work anymore. - That's why we need to go down there. Maybe he's still at the research center, and, you know, could get a few good shots while we're there. We're going, right? - No cameras. - No cameras. Yes? - Hi, is that Tom Delaney at the Herald? Who is this? - It's Jed Bailey. Who? - You ran that story I wrote for you about the royal family. What? - The Queen Mother was an alien? Oh, that Jed Bailey. Do you know what time it is? - Nevermind that, I've got something you are gonna be interested in. Look, the Herald is a serious newspaper. I'm not printing any more of your claptrap. Do you know how many complaints we got last time? - Well no publicity is bad publicity, right? That's your opinion. - Anyway, just listen to this. Disaster strikes at top secret research facility. Everyone is forced to sign NDAs so they can't talk about it, but I've got an inside source. What sort of research facility? - Nobody knows. So it could be nothing. - So it could be anything! Look, if your source is genuine, then I'll look at whatever you send me, but it can't be hearsay. There's got to be evidence. - Like what? Pictures, Jed, photographs. If there's anything mysterious going on there, we've got to see it. - Ah, right. Is that a problem? - No, it's not a problem. - I shouldn't have brought you here. It was in my contract. No one visits the center. - Yeah well I'm here now. Didn't realize it was so big. Dr. Peterson? Dr. Peterson! - He's a professor. - Professor, Professor Peterson! Does that open the door? - Yeah but I doubt if the code still works. - Professor Peterson! - I told you, they shut everything down, sent everyone home. - Well do you know where he lives? - I never saw the professor leave the building. He was always here, always working. - Well maybe he's still inside. Is that an intercom? - I'm so sorry. I've let you down. There's nothing left now. Professor Peterson! Yes? - Let me. Professor, it's me, Kayleigh. Kayleigh Ma? What are you doing here? - I, we came to see you. This is private property, you have no business here! Please leave. - Hey, wait a minute Professor, we've come a long way to see you, and you owe Kayleigh an explanation. - I owe no one anything. I operated within the terms of Kayleigh's contract. Perhaps she should do the same, which includes not bringing uninvited guests to my research center. - Let's go. - What, that's it, you just wanna leave? - He's right, we've no right to be here. Sorry Professor, I just wanted to see you. That's all. - Why? - To talk about what happened, you know, and other things. I've opened all the locks. Come on up. Take care, we're operating on emergency backup power from the generator, so the lights are out. - What is it with you and the professor? Is there something I should know? - Come on. - Slow down, this place is like a maze. How do you even find your way in here? 12 hours a day, six days a week for seven months, remember? I know this building intimately. - Do you know the professor intimately as well? - Maybe you should wait here. - What? No way. Stop trying to shut me out. You wouldn't have come this far if it wasn't for me. - That's true. You're pushy, do you know that? - I'm persistent. It's a positive trait in a reporter. - Just don't mention that to the professor. It's good to see you. - And who is this? - Jed Bailey sir, I'm-- - He's a friend of mine. - So, you wanted to talk? - Well, you know, after the accident everything happened so quickly. We all had to leave. Contracts terminated, the project shut down. - You saying I overreacted? - No, I-- - Three deaths, Kayleigh! - What? - Jed. - Three deaths? I thought this was some kind of accident? What are you people doing here? - We were supposed to be saving lives, not costing them. But somehow we just seemed to get sidetracked along the way. - You did what you had to to keep the project funded. - What project? - You heard of bio-printing, Mr. Bailey? - Yeah, it's like 3D printing for cells, to make organs and limbs for transplant, that kind of thing, yeah? - Exactly. - But isn't that technology way off in the future? I mean, we can't do that now. - Bio-printing of blood vessels was carried out successfully as far back as 2010. - Blood vessels? - If that doesn't impress you, perhaps this might. Within this building there are a number of large metal security doors. A couple of years ago I was doing inventory. I accidentally set off the security system. One of the doors slammed shut on the fingers of my left hand. When they cut me free, two of my fingers were missing. - Jesus, you 3D printed yourself new fingers? - Yes, that was my first successful test! - Blood vessels is one thing, but you're talking about skin and muscle and bone. - The bone we use is actually ceramic, the same stuff they use for artificial hips. We added a special polymer to help it bond to the real bone on a molecular level. - And we printed layer upon molecular layer of bio matter, mixed together with hydrogel to hold it all into place. - Bio matter, how does that become flesh and blood? - You've heard of stem cells, Mr. Bailey? - Stem cells are capable of developing into any body part. We just add suitable amino acids based on a complex 3D scan of whatever we want to create. - In this case we merely took 3D scans of my right hand and mirrored the image. - But isn't experimenting with stem cells illegal? - Mr. Bailey, you ask a lot of questions. - It's a habit, I'm a curious person. - Perhaps you'd like to go down to the hangar, have a look at our most recent experiment. - Professor, I don't think that's a good idea. - Oh, we've nothing to lose. Besides, it's been in there more than three months behind that shutter. I can't believe for one moment it's survived. - What hasn't survived? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Put this on. - Is this really necessary? - It's different down in the hangar. It's where we did the real, practical research. There are chemicals, gases, and the power's out so it'll be dark. You'd better wear this as well. - Don't have to treat me like a child, you know. I'm used to dangerous places. I trekked the Inca Trail. - Wasn't that on a package holiday? - That's not the point. You're an investigative reporter you go where the story is, no matter what. - I wouldn't get your hopes up. As the professor said, there's nothing alive down there. - You okay? Well, here goes nothing! Who's going to go in and take a look? Me. - Kayleigh. What is it? - Nothing, just might need one of these, that's all. You ready? - Always. - Just stay behind me, step where I step, and don't touch anything. - What have you got in there, King Kong? - Hello Mr. Andrews. - What are you playing at, Peterson? Why haven't you been responding to calls? - We had a successful build. - What? When? - Oh, three months ago. - Well this is fantastic. When were you going to tell us? - Ah, it's not quite that simple. - Listen Peterson, this isn't your personal pet project anymore. Blacklake and its partners in government have invested millions in this. Whatever you've created belongs to us. - Don't breathe in the gas, it's sulfur dioxide. What's that? Don't! - It's not for publication, alright? I'm just trying to see something. - Now, how far have you progressed with tier two? - Still at the theoretical stage. - What? Three months after a successful build of a full-scale creature and you have still not progressed to tier two? - This thing, Andrews, it was a disaster. Three members of staff were killed. - Spare me your excuses, Peterson. - When you're preparing for war, collateral damage is inevitable. - In any case we've ran out of funds. I had to shut most of the systems down, we've been running on emergency power, we've no staff. - For God's sake Peterson. I should have known you couldn't handle a project of this scale. Look, I'm coming down there. - No, no, no. - I want to see all the data that you have for tier two. We will discuss your financial irregularities as well. - I told you no cameras. - I'll just be a second. Just need to-- - Jed! Jed! - Gotcha. - For God's sake. - Actually I did feel something. - Would you like a glass of water, Mr. Bailey? - I'm fine. - Thank you, thank you Kayleigh for dealing with that. I know they were close colleagues of yours. - How can you leave things like that? What about those people's families? Haven't you notified the authorities? - You know I can't. - Look, I know it was all top secret, but it's your project. If anyone can talk about it, you can. - Ah, well it's not strictly my project. What? - For christsake, I don't care whose project it is, I just want to know what you have down there! What have you been keeping from me? Fine, I'm out of here, and I'm calling the cops to tell them you've got a body in your goddamn basement. Jed. - Alright. Mr. Bailey, please, sit down. What we have down there, is a large therapod. A bipedal carnivore. - Actually it's a facsimile thereof. - Well a facsimile, yes, but nonetheless a living, breathing example of a creature that has not walked this earth for more than 65 million years. - 65 million years? Oh come on, you can't mean-- - A dinosaur, yes. Tyrannosaurus Rex, to be precise. - Bullshit. - It's what we've been working on all this time. - I thought it was medical research. - Well it was, to begin with. 3D printing of organs, limbs for transplantations. We had some initial success with frogs and larger reptiles, but before we could move to the human trials, a change in the law meant that stem cell research was impossible. - The bio matter used in the printing process was cultured from stem cells from reptile fetuses. It was essential because the matter was required to develop into all kinds of biological tissue, and only stem cells can do that. - So we were left with a supply of lizard stem cells and no research project, not to mention a great deal of debt. So the question became not how to save lives, but-- - How you could make a ton of money. - For centuries man has been fascinated by dinosaurs. We see them in books, museums, the cinema. Who wouldn't want to see a living, breathing dinosaur? What an incredible educational addition to any zoo or theme park? - But how is that even possible? A dinosaur is not a frog or a finger. - It wasn't as difficult as you'd imagine. - There are plenty of examples of fossilized T-Rex skeletons around the world. We were fortunate enough to photograph one so extensively that we could create a 3D plan for a bone structure. - We already had a number of large lizard cross-sections on file. We used software to automatically re-map a present-day alligator's biology onto a T-Rex bone structure. - And it worked? - No, not at first. - The first printout collapsed in on itself. The cell structure failed to hold. It was little more than soup. And the second one. - The second one collapsed as well. But it lived. For seven minutes. A misshapen, barely formed creature, its flesh and organs putrefying by the second as it tried to breathe, its lungs bubbling with hydrated gel that was supposed to hold the whole thing together. The sound it made. - There were a lot of problems, but we made adjustments, recalculated, and. And now it's down there. - I want to see it. - Jed, I don't think that's-- - I want to see it, and I want to photograph it. - Mr. Bailey, I'm sure it's long dead. - Can't believe you didn't tell me about this. I have to write this, I have to break this story! - This is not a story! - Are you kidding me? This is the biggest story in the world, and it's gonna have pictures. - Jed. - Kayleigh, wait. I can lock all the doors from here on this terminal. - I'm sorry Professor, I'll get him to come back. - Yeah? - Jed, where are you? I'm in the chamber. - Please don't do this. - Kayleigh, I have to. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. - It's alive? - We've got to get him out. Unlock the doors. - How can it be alive? It's been three months in the dark, the cold, no food. - Professor, please. - You can't go down there, it's too dangerous. - Professor. - Focus your mind on the question. How can it have survived? - I don't bloody care! - Focus! - The dark and cold. - Yes? - Three months it's been in the dark and cold, you've been on emergency power, no heat or light in the chamber. - Yes? - We used alligator biology to fill in blanks on the creature's body structure. Alligators can lie dormant for entire winters without feeding. The dormant state is triggered by cold temperatures. - Incredible. That's it! - Now let me out of this office. - Kayleigh. - You don't care, do you? People are dying and you don't bloody care! - I'm just trying to protect you. - Oh yes, you care about me alright. - What? - Isn't it enough that for seven months I was laughed at and called your favorite? In and out of this office six times a day instead of being at my workstation. Always kept out of harm's way whenever we attempted a printout. - I didn't-- - Why are you so concerned with protecting me when you're quite happy to risk everyone else's lives? Whatever your intentions are, I'm not interested. I just want you to unlock the doors so I can go and help Jed. Herald Newspapers. - Hi, Tom, it's Jed Bailey. Two calls in one day. To what do I owe this pleasure? - It's that story I was telling you about. Oh yes, your secret research center? - Yeah. Alright, what have you got for me? - I've got good news and I've got bad news. What's the bad news? - You might never see me again. I said, what's the bad news? - It's not what you think. - I don't wanna hear it. Unlock the doors. - You're not gonna believe what I'm looking at right now. Go on, I can hardly wait to hear this. - They made a dinosaur. Tom? Sorry, it must be a bad line. I thought you said they made a dinosaur. - That is what I said. A dinosaur in a research center, that's even more ridiculous than the rubbish you sent me last time. - I'm looking at the damn thing right now, listen! Did you hear that? I heard something. - I'm telling you this is the scoop of the century. Get me clear pictures of it and then we'll talk. Otherwise you can forget it. - Kayleigh. I've never actually told you why I started this project. - Shit, sorry, sorry! Don't like light, huh? - Who is it? - Jennifer, my daughter. - She looks like me. - I suppose so. - Where is she? - She had a congenital heart defect. They said she wouldn't live past her teens, but she was a determined young lady. She was actually halfway through her medical PhD when it finally gave out. She was on a waiting list, but the waiting list was so long. Even in the most expensive private hospital in the country. - What happened? - She died. On the same day as the accident. Kayleigh, you're so like her. I'm not physically, your spirit, your intelligence. She was headstrong, adventurous. I couldn't save Jennifer. We were still years away from creating a heart in a lab. And anyway the funding was running short. So I had to change the nature of the project to this. Eventually, I ran out of time. We both heard what happened in the chamber. We both understand the lethal power of that creature. I'm certain he's dead. - You were certain the creature was dead. - It's too dangerous. - You say Jennifer was determined, adventurous. - Yes. - Would you have changed her in any way? - Of course not. - Then stop trying to change me. - The doors are unlocked. - Christ, I gotta get outta here. Can't you just leave me alone, you bastard? - Jed? Jed? - Yeah. - You're alive! Can you get out? - Not really. This things blocking my way, and it really doesn't like it when I move. - It's based on alligator biology. Alligators have a blind spot when you're right in front of them, but if you move to the side it'll see you straight away. - So what's the answer? - Maybe you could try running between its legs? - Fuck that. Peterson? Peterson, I'm coming down. - Andrews. - The chamber is full of sulfur dioxide, you can't stay in there much longer. You'll permanently scar your lungs. - Honey that's the least of my worries right now. Listen, I'm sorry. - For what? - You know, being an asshole. It's my fault we came here, and it's my fault I'm stuck in this stupid chamber. I always wanted to be one of the great reporters, you know? This was my chance. I'm sorry. - Don't. Being contrite doesn't suit you. Why can't you be brave and stupid like you normally are and get out of there? If you don't try something you'll die anyway when your lungs stop working. - Okay. Give it my best shot. Smile, you son of a bitch. - Jed, Jed? You made it. Jed? - Kayleigh, we may have a problem. - Peterson. And who's this? - My research assistant. - Good, good. Well, in there, is it? - Yes. - Can we open this up, take a look? - I wouldn't recommend it. - I suppose not. Sounds as deadly as we intended, anyway. - What? - Oh yes, talk about shock and awe. Drop one of these behind enemy lines and they'll soon know about it. - Is that what this is about? Are we making a weapon? - Not now. - You said we were making this for the world to see, to show what the research was capable of. - Not entirely with the program, is she Peterson? What about tier two? - Tier two? - Look, I only have theoretical data. I haven't tried a printout. - If that's a weapon, what the hell is tier two? - Well, whilst it's clearly a superbly effective killing machine, a live T-Rex does present certain tactical and logistical difficulties. Ideally we want to combine its brutality, strength, and fear-inducing qualities with the skills and train-ability of a traditional soldier. But apparently there hasn't been much movement in that area. - Well as you know, there was a funding shortfall, and-- - You're the only research scientist I know who can take a quarter of a billion pounds and turn 'round and say he's run out of funding. Perhaps we ought to claw back some of that money that you channeled into your daughter's private medical care. Yes, we know all about that. Oh frankly Peterson we don't give a damn. We're publicly funded, after all. We waste more money in a single day than most legitimate businesses turn over in a year. But we do expect results. - I could log in to one of the work stations. Show you what I've got. - Yes. Watch her. - My pleasure. Nice hat. So you really got a dinosaur in there? - Why don't you see for yourself? - Yeah, right. - Too scared? - Scared? You see this? Got that in Afghanistan. Right before I got my pilot's license. That was proper ground fighting. - Like I said, I only have theoretical data. - And you've done no practical tests? - Well how could I? Should have seen the early builds of the T-Rex. They were horrific. And I need a healthy human volunteer. Well I couldn't risk their lives. Their very humanity. - There you go again, worrying about lives. - Don't get me wrong, I love flying a chopper. 19 rocket pods, laser-guided hellfire missiles. Triple cannon Gatling gun. Air to air strikers. Almost took a guy's head off with my rotor blade. Well, I set his handles. Got it right here. That's nothing on proper ground fighting. Seeing those bastards eye to eye when you're ripping their guts out. Their warm blood dripping down your wrists. - This program's complete, right? - Theoretically. - So, if I execute the program, what will happen? - Well the program will send the data to the laser at the other side of our metal shield. Course we don't have a human volunteer to build on. - What about her? - No, no, no, no, she's crucial to the success of the program. - Really? Only I got the impression a moment ago that she hadn't a clue what was going on here. Seemed perfectly expendable to me. Wait here. Stand down, Sergeant. Get inside the chamber. - Why? - You're here to help us with our research, that's exactly what you're going to do. Get inside the chamber. - No! - Where the hell did he get that? - I'm not taking orders from you anymore, Andrews. I never wanted any of this. Kayleigh it's true, I swear. I just needed to finish my research. - As far as I'm concerned, you are finished. Shoot him. Get off! - Oh God. - Let me out, let me out! - Don't shoot, Peterson. You don't want to hit your precious lab assistant now, do you? What's that? - It means there's about to be a printout. - Looks like you're going to get your prototype after all, Andrews. - What about the T-Rex? - It'll be fine. The program's designed to build on human tissue, pinpoint accurate. It'll only use a tiny percentage of the laser's power. - Is it done? Then prepare yourselves for the soldier of the future. Oh no! - You alright? - Yes, yes, I'll print another collarbone if I have to. It's gonna destroy the place. We should get out of here. - What about the work stations? All that data? - I think there's some research the world can do without, don't you? Come on! - Are you alright? - I'm okay. I just remembered I've got a bad collarbone. - Excuse me, sorry. - What was the line? - Somewhere along the way. There's some data search the world's. How could it survive? - I don't bloody care.
