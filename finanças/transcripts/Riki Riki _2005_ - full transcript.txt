Riki. What? Never mind. What? I said, never mind. Are you cheating on me? What? Who are you having an affair with? You're not serious. Who is it? The baboon? Who? The baboon with the Boxer, from downstairs. I thought you were serious. Now, baby, I have to get back to work. Wait a minute... I'm totally serious. What about that nerdy lecturer of yours, what's-his-name... Max! Yeah, Max! Yeah, Max. Today, of all days, you're trying to drive me crazy? You are so obvious. I don't believe it, you actually think... Thanks a lot. I bust my ass, run from one audition to another, degrade myself on that pathetic show, and you're having a thing with your lecturer! What thing? You're always saying that he gets all giddy around you. You're the one who's always saying... - You're in love with him. In love with him? I... It's ridiculous that you're crying. It's almost funny. How can you be jealous of him? How could you even think that... How? Hey, handsome, we're getting married in a month. I had a thing too. What do you mean, you had a thing? What did you say? I had a thing. With who? Naomi. Who's Naomi? From the show. The girl who plays the bee. But you told me she's an insane bimbo. She is an insane bimbo. It only happened once. I'm sorry, it just happened. When? Last week. Here at home? No, I'd never do that to you. Are you in love with her? No, I told you, it only happened once and that's it. I'm really sorry. I didn't even enjoy it. She was just a lay, and a lousy one if it makes you feel any better. I'm glad you're being so mature about it. Yeah. It's kind of selfish of you to tell me today, of all days... Sorry I threw that on you the day before your final project. I just felt shitty about it and couldn't hold it in any longer. Do you want me to go? I'll go and let you finish your project. That's all that matters. My brother is away, I'll be at his place. We'll talk later. Are you okay? I'm fine. "You can buy this toaster-oven only here on the community channel for... "Only 40 shekels. "So don't just sit there and regret it later. "Pick up the phone and place your order now. "Ladies and gentlemen, The Bee is informing us "that you will be receiving a bonus too! "A fashionable bath rug worth 70 shekels!" Hello? Kiki, I am so depressed. The neighbors complained and got us kicked out of our apartment. Definitely worth a wrist slash, no? Yeah. Are you coming with me to Jerusalem tomorrow to model my project? I'll probably be looking for an apartment tomorrow. Did I bum you out? No, you didn't bum me out. I won't submit it tomorrow, I'd fail anyway. You drama queen, as if you're the only one with problems. Since Mom and Dad croaked, you've become so over-sensitive. Why do you bring that up? What are you trying to do? Bum me out completely? You know what, Kiki? If I come with you tomorrow... Yeah? Will you let me crash at your place for a few days? Please? Okay. Good night, Sharon. Be here tomorrow at 7:30, sharp. Hey, guys. There is a God. Good afternoon. While designing this project, I decided to focus... on the wedding of... While designing this project, I decided to fall apart... I decided to focus on the exposure of ugliness opposite the power of the illusion of beauty. I asked myself: What is the ugliest, most repulsive thing about our body and reached the conclusion that it is human refuse. Why do we relate to it as ugly? What can I do, as a designer, to make this daily parting easier? And now, the demonstration. Riki? May I? Yes, of course. Let's assume that a Martian happens to land here and we ask him to guess what the function of a standard toilet is. I don't think he'll be able to tackle this task, because its morphological correlation with the human body looks incidental. The whole world has become user-friendly, yet the toilet is still stuck in the 18th century, trapped in its own contour. I think that Riki was very brave, very imaginative, in a realm that very few designers dare to contend with. And as for her technical abilities, there's no need to elaborate. Riki, do you have a minute? Of course. I wanted to thank you. You really saved my life. I didn't have enough time to prepare my lecture and you... It's part of my job. - Anyway, thank you so much. I knew you'd do something unique. I even thought about you last night. I mean, concerning the project. Not personally. I mean, personally, but personally-professionally. Of course. You're lovely. I mean, your project is lovely. Well... It was a pleasure being your lecturer... It was a pleasure being your student, it was very... very educational. So I guess it's goodbye? I guess. Bye, and once again, thank you so much. Riki... How are you getting back to Tel Aviv? Taxi. Why, want to share one? No... I have a car, I thought you might want a ride. It might be inappropriate, I understand if you don't want to. I don't think it'll work out, it's going to take me a while to get my stuff together. Excuse me. Hello? Riki? What? How did it go? Fine. I passed. Anything else? - Are you okay? I'm fine. When will you get home? - In a couple hours. Why? I want to come over to get some clothes. Why? How long are you planning to stay there? Fine, no problem. Bye. About the ride, that would be great. Riki, there's a problem. I only have room for one more person. The back seat is full of boxes. No problem. My sister wanted to stay in Jerusalem and visit the Wailing Wall anyways. Then I'll see you in a bit. Riki, I applied for a grant for you to go to a seminar in Domus Academy. No way! That's the best school in the world, why me? Because you have the most talent. I don't believe it! You're so sweet! Thank you! You're so sweet! Are you okay? Some things shouldn't happen between students and lecturers. Oh, no, it was just a harmless kiss, I never meant to... No, of course not. I know you're the genre of girls who'd never go out with someone like me. Why not? That's got nothing to do with it, you're a very nice person and... Yes? And you have a very intense look. But I'm not emotionally available at the moment. Do you have a... I mean... Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. Great. Is it serious? I mean, are you planning to get married? I'm not too crazy about ceremonies in general, but Asher is... Asher is... Pressuring you. A little. Yes. What about you? Are you married? Unfortunately, it's kind of complicated. At least you get some action. Not really, it's complex, but I can't talk about it. That's all right, it's none of my business. She was the love of my life. We had some sort of a pact and... She died? She... kind of left me. It's hard when it's still so fresh. It happened 3... 4 years ago. But it's only a matter of time. Time is the best healer. Thanks. Riki, excuse me I'm really tired from the drive, I need some caffeine, badly. Are there any cafes around here? Somewhere quiet, intimate, cozy. Come inside, I'll make you some. - The thing is... I don't know. You see, there are rules that I don't... - Max. It's just coffee. I hope you're not offended. It's nothing personal. I'm not. Everything's fine. See you, little darling, thanks for understanding. Shimshon! Come here! What's with you? That's Sharon's sister, this is her place. So you're the band? What are you doing here? It's party-time. Say what? Sharon cut us a key, just in case we... She asked us to wait for her here till she gets back. What's your name? Shimshon. And this big guy here is Sinai. That's Gomez the parasite. Hey, Sharon's sister, wanna have a smoke? No, thanks. And my name is Riki. Riki! Was Asher here? Did some guy come here to get some clothes? I don't think so, I'd remember that. C'mon, guys, it seems that Sharon's sister wants some privacy... Yeah, it's been a hard day. What, Asher? Hello, Riki, it's Batia. Oh, Batia, I'm sorry, I forgot. I know, it's okay, I'm waiting for you at the clinic... Tell me what you've been going through the past two weeks. I want to know. The wedding, your project. Everything's the same as usual. Riki... I want you to consider psychoanalysis. You know, lying on the sofa, 4 times a week instead of once, we'll dig deeper inside. - Batia, that's impossible, my inheritance money is almost all gone and our financial situation... I'll probably start looking for a job, so I'll give you a call and we'll meet in a few weeks. Must I remind you how much progress we made? Must I remind you what a state you were in, Riki? Well, it's no wonder. Seeing both your parents burned to a char... It's so awful. Batia, you know I hate when you bring that up for no reason. So why do you do it? - For the proportions. Batia, I don't want to continue with this therapy. Are you okay? Don't look at me as if I were insane. No, it's okay, it happens, it's completely natural. I'm just a little emotional and it's finally happening. You're finally letting me treat you, you're finally projecting on me, Riki. It's absolutely wonderful. You must've misunderstood, I meant that I don't want to continue. Very good, Riki, very good, I want to know why. Why don't you want to continue? Tell me, go on, say: "Batia, you're not alert, not attentive to my needs," go ahead, unload, take it out on me, Riki, come on. See? We wasted all our time. Shlomo, two seconds! So when? Tomorrow? The day after? Same time? Hello? Tsipi? From the catering. We have to decide already? Look, the problem is... we haven't had the chance to discuss the menu yet, we haven't made up our minds. By tomorrow afternoon? No problem, I'll call you. It's just me. Riki's sister. Sorry, but nowadays, a keffiyeh headdress is a symbol, a scary symbol... What's there to do in Jerusalem? Shopping. What are you doing here? Oh, no, I'm... just going to have some coffee at Asher and Riki's. She asked me over earlier. Come on in. Sorry, Riki no home. So you go your way, I'll go mine. How did you like Riki's inflatable toilet? Heavy question. I connected with it. I connected with it because there were times I constantly had diarrhea. Dieting. You're nuttier than your sister. My sister? Earth calling Max. My sister is as mainstream as it gets. And I must be a complete nerd. You're... You're Howdy Doody. Don't be so judgmental. I was quite a wild youngster. I was a Boy Scout leader, studied shiatsu. Pretty much out of control. So do you wanna plug my sister? - What?! Shame on you, of course not, no. She's my student. Besides, she has Asher. Howdy, there's still hope. I think Riki and that Asher jerk had a real bad fight yesterday. I am blessed with sharp intuitions, and I'm telling you, right now, even someone like you stands a chance. How flattering. Thank you. I'll be going now. It was very nice... meeting you. Hi. Hello, I was just... How did... Your sister. What? I do want to come in for coffee, remember your question earlier? I even went home and made us some espresso, but your sister couldn't resist the splendid aroma, should I stay, should I go, what? No, you just surprised me. Excuse me for a moment. When are you going to finish this? Chill, sis, we have a few more loose ends to tie up, and we're out. Come in. Sorry about the mess. Coffee? No, thanks. Are you okay? I'm great. But, you see, I have rules. It's hard when female students like you seduce me. Relax, I'm not trying to seduce you. - Yes, you are. No, I swear I'm not. - Yes, you are. I'm not. Thank you. Thank you for being nice to me. Why wouldn't I be? Why did you invite me over? I just thought it'd be nice to chat, and it has been really nice, but... Max, listen, I'm sorry, but... I repulse you. - No, of course not, I just don't want to get carried away. It's Asher. Not that I'm crazy about everything he does, but I can't... I know you had a fight. I just want to give you a treatment, don't worry. You know what? Give me the treatment. Why not? I'll be a little tense, but don't take it personally, okay? Max... I didn't shave my legs... That's okay, it makes you human. Max, what are you? It's shiatsu, doesn't it feel good? Yes, it's just that... Don't worry, I took a course. Okay. Am I hurting you? No. Does it feel good, little darling? Do I make you feel good? Very good. The tailbone is a problematic area. Breathe into the pain. Inhale... and exhale loudly. Inhale and exhale out loud. Mistake. It was a mistake. But don't blame yourself, okay? - Okay. When that story happened with the woman I had a pact with... I'm sorry to let out this depressing stuff on you... - It's okay. Do I talk too much? - No, it's really okay. I was in a state, understand? Don't get me wrong, when I saw you for the first time in class, I was already alone, I just waited for the right moment, strategically. I shouldn't have come over, but you invited me. I couldn't refuse, and now it's really hard for me to leave, I may need you to throw me out. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. Please, don't play with my feelings. No, I... You're a great human being, and during my first year, I even... I admired all my lecturers, not only you. Everybody admired everybody, not only me. But I... I have a boyfriend. Just tell me to leave. Throw me out. Okay... I'm throwing you out. Thank you. Thank you, you're an angel. I'm sorry about this. Thank you for a magical evening. Yeah, it was fun. You're great. I'm sorry. Bye. Riki? Hello? Didn't you say you were coming to get some clothes? I had an important audition. Something for primetime. Actually, it's a good thing you didn't come, because Max, my lecturer, gave me a ride home and... - And what? Never mind. - Don't give me that. Spit it out. Never mind. - Did he come inside? Yes, he did. - Did that faggot fuck you? Answer me. Just let it go, please... I'm not in the mood for interrogations. You did a lousy thing to me, Riki! I did a lousy thing to you? Asher? Hello? Asher... You've got a real electrifying touch. Are you from the band too? You're still here? Do it again. But not in the stomach. Try in the neck. Are you some kind of retard? - No. Why? Yo, Sharon's sister. It's 5 a.m. I love you, brother. Check out Ramon. He took 5 Ecstasies in a row and miraculously he's still alive! Very impressive. - Give me a hug, brother. You're totally hugged, man! Fuck, I got stung by a bee. I zapped you with the shocker. You motherfucker! Where did you get that? It's so cool. Take it, it's yours, just please get out of my room. Good night. Thank you. Give her a few Spaceships, instead of rent money. That won't be necessary. Thank you. I don't want any. Don't put those things in my bag. Don't. Okay, put those things in my bag. Thank you. Great, good night. No! No! Hello? Hello? What's with this place? The electricity constantly blows out, there's nothing to eat. Then buy something, make something. Sis, I'm not being selfish. It's those poor guys. They're starving. Do I look like their mother? I want those decadents out of my house! Chill, sis. We're getting our shit together. - Would you please leave me alone? Listen, I see things. So if you decided to kick Asher the Satan out of your life because you've got the hots for that cute melon-head Max, I take my hat off to you. Really. I back you, totally. I never liked that Asher. He gives out the vibes of a dog. What, are you crying? Kiki, don't cry. I'll start crying too. Muki... You're such a Snoopy when you're sad. You're so sweet. I'm a little attracted to you. What did you say? Attracted. Attracted to you. I'm your sister. So? What's that got to do with it? I think you're sexy. I even had a little crush on you. Whatever you do, don't let this stress you out. It's probably a projection that... - It's cool. I even masturbated while thinking about you a few times. I don't want to hear it. Why? Because you annoy me even when you aren't talking bullshit. You've got a major problem with intimacy. I pity you. I apologize, Rabbi. I have no idea why he didn't show up. I promise to get back to you within the hour. I'm sorry, and thank you. I'm not trying to get us back together, I just think we should talk about what we did, like adults. I fell asleep on the couch. I'll get dressed and we'll go out for a bite to eat? I want to talk somewhere quiet. Are you gonna let me in or what? Where are you going? Do I have to inform you about every step I take? No, but it's disgusting, what are you, spying on me? I just wanted to go to the bathroom. I'm glad you came. I love you. Why are you testing me? You know how I feel? I feel like dying just thinking that someone else touched you. I didn't sleep with him, you idiot, I wouldn't do that to you. Baby, I'm crazy about you, crazy about you! As of today, may my dick fall off if I ever touch another woman. And you won't go near that Max or anyone else either. We're getting married and that's it, okay? Just for general knowledge, how many times did you sleep with her? I told you. Only once. Now get her out of your head. She's just an insane bimbo. And a lousy lay. Frigid. I'd rather shag her grandpa than touch her again. An insane bimbo? You fucking cock sucker, you piece of shit! How dare you say that about my grandpa, the great Kabbalistic Rabbi, may he rest in peace! What a nasty thing to say! Disgusting! What are you doing here? Shut the fuck up! And thanks for not humping her right over my head! Asshole... You call me frigidaire? My mouth is still sleepy from the spermicide. Fuck you... The wedding is off. What? Are you crazy? Wait, Riki, you don't understand! Look what you've done, you stupid cow! Are you trying to ruin my life?! You, fucking asshole! I've had it with you! You and all your bullshit: The vibrators and your animal-porn movies! Fuck you, you piece of shit! I've had it! I'm a religious person! Riki! Riki! I was sure you cheated on me. You've got to believe me. But as of today, everything's going to change, I promise. I made it to primetime. I've been offered to host a show on primetime! Everything's gonna be okay now. I'll be famous, we'll have money. Wait, Riki, talk to me! Riki! What are you, blind? Shut the fuck up. Hey, watch it! I don't recommend you to mess with me! Get your hands off me, you don't know who you're messing with. You better watch your mouth before I lose it! Fuck off, you loser! Good afternoon. We didn't order anything. Oh, no, these are just a few staple items. I know that Riki and Asher's financial situation isn't that great. Are you our auntie or something? You're Riki's little sister. Wow, sweetie. You poor thing, look at you. What a shame. Is Riki here? No. I'm Batia, her psychologist. I'm also her confidante, so perhaps I could wait for her inside? I don't know. Yeah. Whatever. Sure. Sharon, Gomez made a mess in the bathroom, he took a bad Spaceship. But me and the guys cleaned up a little, so it's not that filthy. I'm sorry, am I disturbing? God, lady, you shit so much! And if I slept with, let's say, 120... - Excuse me? Not just men, younger ones too. Yes. And let's say, I didn't really enjoy it, could I be a lesbo? Are you attracted to women? You may have a point there... Say, doctor, do you know anything about tumors? Excuse me? - Cancer. I've got tons of weird-Iooking moles. No, that's not my field. - I've got a humongous one here. That's not my field... Tell me... Do you have any medical insurance? Riki! What's going on here? What's going on? You didn't show up for our appointment... Did she do something to you? She just examined the mole on my ass. You're so suspicious. You actually think that I'd... - I'm sorry, Batia, I didn't see it was you. Have a seat right here and we'll start opening up, damn it. Batia, I'm a little tired. No wonder, with all those animals living here. And with everything that happened to you, Riki, I wouldn't sleep a wink for years. The whole tragedy, your parents... Such a horror... - Batia... - Let's do something spontaneous! We'll go out for a drink, my treat. We'll go anywhere you want. Just for a chat, a little small talk. Thank you, but I'm beat. The only thing I can think about is getting into bed. Shall we? Batia, that man keeps looking at you. Why? Turn back towards me and don't stare at him. How do you do. I'm Avraham. Excuse me, but I'm having an intimate conversation with my friend here. Can I help you? I apologize for interrupting. He was nice. So he was nice, so what? Big deal. Wait, aren't you divorced? Never been married. Never married, Riki. I don't need him thinking he's "all that". He should have been more persistent. There are plenty of fish in the sea. So he left. Fine. You get used to the Ioneliness, Riki. It's there. You get up in the morning, it's there. You go to sleep, it's there, waiting just for you. Until you find something so sound and safe in this life, I won't give it up. For what? A pig in the poke? For some "How do you do, I'm Avraham"? But forget about that, Riki, you're getting married! You're getting married! Hi. Riki? Are you alone? Yes, most of the time. Can I come in? Oh, sure, come on in. Make yourself at home. When did you move in? 4 years ago. Why? Oh, the boxes. Something to drink? Coffee? Tea? Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice? No, my esophagus is contracted. Are you okay? Aren't you going to give me a welcome kiss? Of course. Welcome, I'm glad you came. A kiss. My legs are kind of jumping from inside, so I'll just crash here until the time goes by. Oh, I see, you came for a treatment, for shiatsu, I didn't understand what... No! Not shiatsu! You're making fun of me, I don't know what I did wrong. I don't get you, I don't get this situation, I'm not good at this. You're easygoing, that's fine, but I really don't understand why you come over and kiss me, why you make me hopeful, how... I'm sorry, but I want to be left alone. Five more minutes, okay? I have a surprise for you. You'll feel it soon. I'm sorry, Riki, this is more than I can take... Riki, I don't know what's come over me. I don't feel good. Not good. Good. Good. Not good. Not good? - Hey, you're glowing. You are so beautiful. You're beautiful. You have so many angles. You're fascinating. You're a panoramic person. I love my dead grandmother's house. It's beautiful, I love the colors on the walls. They're lovely. Like your hair. Your hair is lovely too. So homogenous, so becoming, so bad, bad, bad, bad. Good, good, good. Do you feel good? Mostly in my balls. This is my surprise. Isn't it fun? Riki, I think I have a fever. My tongue fell asleep too. I really feel like clapping my hands, but I'm embarrassed to. You are so cute, I could die. I love the Yarkon River. I come here a lot, especially when I need to think. When I was a kid, I'd come here with my family on New Years and we'd do the ritual of emptying our pockets into the river. Does it surprise you that I was ultra-orthodox? What? A Hassid? Wait, you were... No, it's kind of cute. Yeah? I want to tell you something too. What? I was born with a little tail. With what? Didn't you see the small scar above my tush? No. It's hereditary, my grandma had it too. Does that bother you? Not at all. Any other genetic information I should know at this stage? You're so mean. You're so gullible, so naive. I'm not gullible, and not as naive as you think. You're as naive as they come. There are things you don't know about me. So now you're trying to fool me? Things that I'd rather not tell you at this stage. Like what? Things that I keep to myself for administrative reasons only. Max, you have a major time perception problem. You're not my teacher anymore. Still, you'll have to trust me. I'd gladly trust you, but lately, I've been having a problem in that area. So if you don't mind, I insist on knowing now, to soften the blow I'm going to take later on. Riki, please, let it go. There was a woman, Elizabeth, I told you about her. Yes? It's not what you think. What do I think? Riki, let's try and go back two minutes in time, to the cool ambiance we already had. I'm totally cool. You're taking everything here too seriously. I'm taking it seriously? I am not taking anything seriously. This little affair of ours only happened for one reason, to make Asher jealous. You're kidding me. No. Goodbye, Riki. Hello? Speaking. What? Yes, he's my boyfriend... my ex... Who is this? Driver, take me to Ichilov Hospital. Asher? What happened to you? Riki. Look! The mafia did it to me. That's okay. The pinkie isn't an important finger anyway. A bunch of pimps jumped me, for no reason whatsoever. Out of pure malice. There are some bad human beings, Riki. Bad human beings. I saw death right before my eyes, Riki. I saw the end. And the only thing I could think about while they were wiping the asphalt with my face and kicking the shit out of my balls, was that you hate me. I don't hate you. I realized you're the only person who cares about me. You're all I have. You'll be okay. You'll see. You always know how to comfort me. You're an angel. When are you coming back? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Avraham? It's Avraham, isn't it? - Yes. Riki. From last night, remember? Listen, don't take her too seriously. Batia. She didn't mean to offend you. It came out involuntarily. She's a little... Loneliness, you know. Never mind. Would you like to dance with me? Damn, you've got loads of fleas here. Good morning, sister. Sharon, what happened here last night? You were so cool last night. Sharon, who was that old lady with the toilet paper? Your mom? What? It's just that you resemble her. Snoopy, he didn't mean a physical resemblance, he meant something that you two convey. I understand, Sharon. I want you and all your tribe out of my house, today! Hello. Max? Hello? Yes. I just wanted you to know that from sitting there in the sun, I must've had a flashback or something and that's why I said some stupid things. Are you there? Can I talk to you? How can I explain it to you... The way I'm built, things happen, but I'm not always... That. Are you getting me? Would you please speak to me linearly? - Okay. It's kind of like my inflatable toilet, if someone takes a dump on my head, I pretend everything's cool and that I even planned it that way. Understand? Let's say... Remember when I told you that Asher was pressuring me to get married? Well... that wasn't... entirely accurate. It was more like... it freaked him out. He also... cheated on me. Twice, as far as I know. And I really wanted to hurt him like he hurt me and you were just there, so... But then, what happened happened and you and I... And I really didn't plan it, I suddenly felt so... And Asher didn't matter anymore, only you. Then when I saw you talking about another woman they way you did, all I could think about was getting back at you too. I don't know why I'm telling you all this, obviously you want her and I'll understand if you never want to see me again. Your decision to never see me again even relieves me, because I don't like having the status of a doormat and just because I came here at a moment of weakness doesn't mean I'm stupid enough to stay for one more second, so that's it. Bye, see you. Do you want to move in with me? What? Do you want to move in with me? You mean you want me to move in here? Yes, that's what I mean. Basically, I don't think there's a problem. Great. Great. I'm not good at "reading" women, especially you, so if something's bothering you or if you're going through something, just tell me, like you just did, okay? Okay, but maybe we should agree that if I tell you to go away or even to get out of my face, you'll just stay. Okay. Let's also agree that you won't ever talk to Elizabeth again. Agreed. You've got nothing to worry about. Me and Elizabeth... - No, no. Not now. So, should I move in now? Today? Yes. Okay, I'll go pack. Just a minute. Don't look so alarmed. Your message said you had to see me, so I came. I'm not alarmed, it's just not a good time. I thought we could meet at a cafe or something. I'm very busy. You don't think I'm the sweetest thing anymore? Elizabeth, this conversation is going in a disharmonic direction to the state I'm in right now. I'm trapped in an emotional loop. I'll call you and we'll meet some other time, okay? Yeah, man? Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm a close friend of the family. What's wrong with you? Why are you choosing the violent way? Where's Riki? I said, where's Riki? Thanks, brother. I'm making you some coffee too. No, none for me, thanks. I'm a little pressed for time. Why aren't you being warm towards me? Haven't you forgiven me? Then why did you call? Don't worry. I'm not going to leave you. I'm still your wife. I didn't marry you just to leave you. Elizabeth, no, please. This is the draft of our divorce agreement, that's why I called. Have your lawyer take a look at it. Are you okay? I'm slightly in shock. Elizabeth, I've been in shock from the day I was born. You get used to it. Get the hell out of my house, now. Now! Pull up your panties and join your friends. I don't want to see you ever again. Hi, Riki. I came to take you to the beach for a spontaneous night swim. Batia, today isn't a good day. Why? It's beautiful outside, warm... Do you know that you're psycho? - Excuse me? Go commit yourself. Get well soon. Hi, baby. What's all the yelling about? My entire body aches. Your psycho boyfriend attacked me for no reason. Asher, for your own good, take yourself and your crutches and everything and get the fuck out of my house. What are you doing here, young lady? Living from day to day. Take care of yourself. Excuse me, officer... Can you arrest me? I can't arrest you without a reason. How about insulting a public servant? Does that count? Who did you insult? - You, you fucking bitch. You're under arrest. - Cool. Come with me. - Awesome. Hi, Riki. It's Max. Where are you? I'm at home, waiting just for you. Bye. Hi. It's Max again. Call me if you hear this. Riki? Riki? Are you okay? I'm fine. Go away. I'm not leaving until you tell me how I can help you. Hi. It's Max again. I don't mean to be a pest, but I'm starting to worry. Don't cry, sweetie. Don't cry. If you're there, pick up, I'm waiting. He didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't think there was anyone shittier than you. I'm sorry for being so shitty. Well, I guess you're not home. Mom... I want my mom... Where is my mom... Don't cry. I'll take care of you, you'll see. Where are you? I'm here. - And? Didn't you get my messages? Yes, I did. - What happened? You changed your mind. I hurt you, something I did or said. I got back together with Asher. Okay, you're hurt, what did I do? Was it because I asked you to move in with me without asking if you want me to move in here with you? Was it because I took the time to clean up the house for you, instead of spending that time with you? Riki, let's try to communicate like two normal people. Let's get some air, let's breathe. And exhale. Go do "ah-ah" to your wife, you son of a bitch. Wait, you came and thought that... About 4 years ago, Elizabeth and I... Who is it, sweetie? It's the superintendent, Asher. Goodbye, Riki. Bye. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. This is Svetlana Pavlova, she's a cop. This is Riki. What now? Nothing, she's my girlfriend. Oh, great. Hi. Is that right? Okay, great, fantastic, what can I say? Nice to meet you, I'm her sister. Snoopy, you're so sweet. So how's your band? Great, except for Ramon who died. He took a rotten trip and croaked. Poor guy. That's the wedding march. Sveta, let's go. "Congratulations, Riki and Asher "May your marriage be as strong as plaster "See you after "With a big belly and a suit made of polyester "Congratulations "Congratulations "Congratulations" "You are consecrated to me with this ring "according to the laws of Moses and Israel. "Consecrated, consecrated." "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem "May my right hand lose its strength." Mr. Photographer. Close-up on my face. Then tilt down to my foot. Okay? Mr. Photographer. Take two. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Cut. Cut. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Fine. And you? Well... Well... Tell me, would you like to have a cup of coffee with me? Yes, sure. Great. Then give me a call when you feel like it. Are you planning on driving me insane my entire live? Obviously. English: Suzy De Lowe Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd. Norma Productions ? all rights reserved
