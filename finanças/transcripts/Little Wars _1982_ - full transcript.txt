Little Wars Story and Script by Maroun Baghdadi Music by Gabriel Yared Directed and Produced by Maroun Baghdadi We enlarged his passport photo. We couldn't find another one. He took it for his French visa. - He looks so hardened. - He always looked like that in photos. - Done with the paperwork? - Yes, done. - I wish you'd come too. - We discussed this already. We'll miss you. When will you come? It's the final call. Better hurry. Take care of yourself. He wanted to leave Hoda. He wanted a break from everyone. - He grew so distant. - Fouad had given up. - He was apathetic. - Ever since the party let him go... Nothing was working in his life. - The house, college, Hoda... - He had his music. - That's all he had. - He stayed with us for a while... with Talal and me. We had the same quirks. He cared about nothing. And the music... always high on drugs... an overdose finally got him. Not true. He committed suicide. A sudden increase in military confrontations since this morning... It's a counter-kidnapping operation. What a complete mess. They better find his son, otherwise this guy they picked up is dead. You can all go to hell. It's the same crap everyday. - Where from? - The airport. OK, go. Hello, Talal. Want some tea? - Any action tonight? - Probably, yes. - Wait. - Want to stay with them? Soraya? You're late, dear. I was worried. I heard on the radio that it's really bad tonight. - No, it's fine. - Was the plane on time? I visited Fouad's parents. God help them. Poor people. - Did you get me batteries? - I forgot. I promise I'll get you some tomorrow. Can you hear? He's crying again. I hear him every night. No, I can't hear him. Fouad was dying slowly. I am sure he realized that. He was never at peace... always pretending. He chose how to die. Sometimes, I envy him. Are we going abroad? I'm going bald. Am I old already? Remember his picture? He looked so defiant. And when? At his lowest. In his defeat. I'm fed up. I don't know, I'm just fed up. Talal, don't you understand me? Make up your mind already. When Fouad left Hoda, you started drifting. You wanted to do the same, didn't you? Sometimes I feel you don't love me. I'm talking nonsense. Can you tell me... did you really want to leave? Are we going to leave? You know how I am. This war means nothing to me. I have nothing to do with it. And yet, I don't want to be away. We can't escape this war. I don't care, I just want to be with you. Ghazi. - What's wrong? - Is Talal in? - Yes, why? - We need him. Excuse us, it's urgent. We need to go. Some men broke in this morning. - Good morning, boss. - Hello. - Here I come. - Hurry. I'll call you later. Here they are. They're here. Go get Midhat. Hani beik, I'm being patient, but please listen to me. It's more serious than that. No, it can't wait. The beik's kidnapping will wreck havoc. There's going to be trouble. No, there is no time for that. Either you deal with it, or get out of the way. It's been 48 hours already. Please, no excuses. Fine. No doubt, no doubt at all. Yes. I agree with you. One second please. Welcome, Talal beik. Salim. Talal beik, welcome. Don't worry about it. - But it's been more than 4 days. - It could be anything. It happens. In any case, I made you an appointment for tomorrow. You're embarrassing us, you idiots. You were supposed to run that way, why are you so scared? - Comrade, there are snipers. - Snipers? I'll show you snipers. Just shoot my ass instead. This is how you do it. - How many fighters are there here? - I can't answer. Classified. At dusk, we started off... Can we talk about the political context? Our battle is for democracy... Look, if he wanted a lecture, he'd join your party. What a clown. Miss, please translate. My dear, these guys want action. Action, got it? - Go on. - The plan was to attack from the shore... This is what happens when you have undisciplined troops. Undisciplined my foot. Hey Guevara, you done liberating Angola? Stand still. You, lift it up a little. Photo. - Hello, Nabil. - Samir, what is going on? Want to buy this? What's this piece of shit? It's WWII material. - I'll sell it for 50. - No, thanks. - Someone else will. - Good for you. Hello, Nabil. Long time no see. Where have you been? You know, I've been very busy. Busy? Don't give me nonsense. You serving the cause now? I'm at your service. Empty talk. - You owe me. - I know. Be patient with me. Come with me. So, Nabil... - Working with Shawki these days? - A little. Where's the money? You almost left me behind. I almost died because of you. What's wrong with you? You just cost me 100,000. Forget it, we're done for. What am I going to do with Shawki now? Now we have smugglers on our heels. Watch the walls. A doctor. Get us a doctor now. You shut up. Give him an injection. I'll bring this hospital down. He was defending you. He got hit defending the trenches. Hold on, calm down. Give him an injection, anything. Grenade. It didn't work. What a piece of junk. Calm down. Relax. It happens. Did your dad leave? Yesterday. Come whenever you want. In a day or two, we'll get the results. We'll know. Don't worry. Should I do something? Tell me, why did you stay in Beirut? College. He'll be fine. Why are you here? Are you OK? - Don't you recognize me? - The TV girl. Welcome. Come on. Move it. So? One of the comrades was injured while overtaking a position. - Is it serious? - No, a few stitches. - And you were there? - Yes, taking photographs. What a damn job. I was with the guys. They decided to liberate a position. Once we got there, the gates of hell swung open. Bullets flying everywhere, total chaos. Hassane got hit. They left him. They left him. No one helped him. What to tell his folks? Luckily, I was there and took him, with Sami's help. They fight on one front, but we fight on all of them. All snipers shoot at us. And in return, I shoot all the injured and dead. - Is your name Nabil? - At your service, miss... - Soghaya? - No, Soraya. Which paper do you work for? A classy paper, all in French. Very, very civilized. By the way, I took some pictures of you. Very lovely. - Stop by and take them. - Sure. By the way, are you OK? You need anything? The line is busy, isn't it? Don't be upset. - Let me try. - No, it's fine. The line is dead. I heard knocking on the door earlier. Dear, these days, you can't just let anyone in. You're a big girl now, you know how it is. Plus, this is their territory. It won't be much longer. The French are coming. - Lights off. - Stop clowning. Let's go. Are you going to be careful? - What's wrong? - Didn't you hear? Didn't see the paper? I stayed up very late. I've been calling you all night. Where have you been? I had a headache. Talal's father. He was kidnapped two days ago. Are you serious? Can we reach him? No way. All the roads are blocked. - What to do? - Calm down. Let me read. I can't calm down. Soraya, please, calm down. I need to read this. Poor Talal, what a mess. He's stuck up there. - What's this? - Inspired by the war. I personally don't like them. Joyce collects them. Are you seeing Joyce these days? She's a nice girl. We weren't close when she was with Philip. What ever happened to him? Did he leave? - Why not? Is it so heroic to stay? - I am not a hero. I just know I am staying. I do not know why though. Why did you stay? Isn't it too late for this question? - What's this? - Talal got it last week. This is ruined. Incredible. Go away. I told you not to come in here when I'm not in. Who's been eating here? Fava beans, you bastards? What a damn mess. Leave me alone. I won't open. I've burned two films already. Leave. I need to work. It's you? Come in. You should have said. - The photos. - Are they ruined? Forget it. You see my state? I can't work at all. It's a complete mess. What's worse, all fighters now want pictures. They take poses, and I have to oblige. Are those all dead? If they were all dead, the war would be over. - Haven't enough died? - Yes, but... It's a charade. They send the pictures to their girls, to their mothers... As for me... Nobody gives a damn. I can't focus. I don't have time for my art. See this one? See this road? 4 snipers were hiding. The moment I showed up... They shot at me... I jumped that way, they threw a grenade... then a small missile. If I hadn't been careful, I'd be dead. My mug would be on a poster. By the way, I took a great picture of you. I took it on the front lines. Don't. Why? Even torn, it's great. - Nabil, can I ask you a favor? - I am at your service. - I need to go to the Beqaa. - The Beqaa? There is no way. The roads are closed. Don't you know? Forget about it. What's wrong? Fine, we'll see. We'll find a way. Don't worry. Smile now. Let me drop off the photos. What is it? Just a precaution. We almost died. Is this your house? This is the comrades' house. - I don't understand. - It's a house we're protecting. Hi guys. Shawki's gang is chasing me. He'll help you out. I'll get you to the first checkpoint. I owe you a favor, my friend. - She's dear to me, please be careful. - Of course. We're all set. Be careful. Good. You're a quick learner. - How did you get here? - I missed you. Me too. Are you alone? - Don't let go. - Come meet Salim. Tell me. What's the news? How I've changed. Look at me now. First Fouad, and now my father. I don't know what to say. I've regressed 10 years. You've been away for a long time. Yes, a long time. Thank god for Selim. He's reasonable, unlike the others. He's got some sense. What will become of your dad, I wonder? He was kidnapped in Beirut. - Why don't you look for him there? - No, the key is here. That's Salim's opinion. We must stay here. Salim sometimes reminds me of Fouad. You know, I had a dream about him yesterday. What's wrong? I'm thinking of you, and me. I don't know. It's so confusing. What are you going to do? What's this? You carry a gun? Since when? Talal, a word. Aren't you ashamed of what people might think? Shame. What would they say about me? You don't care. Your dad is missing. You have responsibilities. Who's that? A college friend. - My private life is my business. - Not in here. Focus on your father. Many depend on us. What are you doing? Going for gun practice, like a thug? You think a gun will bring him back? Grow up. Forget Beirut and its corruption. You talk to me like I am a child. My life is different from yours. This here is not my world. - Beirut is better than this sad place. - Beirut ruined you. I have my freedom there. You freedom has ruined you. It's ruined us. Wake up. You care about nothing. You're irresponsible. We've spoiled you. It's our fault. We spoiled your sister, Nayla, too. You both don't care. She's been away for a year. She's not called or written even once. God knows where she is. Mother, look at me. I'm not like Nayla. I respect and love you, but I'm not like you. I want a different life. - What is it? - I need mister Talal. A phone call. Party strife has ruined this region. We must unite it. We must unite it, at gunpoint if needed. The time is now. Talal is a different breed. He can change things. He can make a difference. People have suffered enough, they need a savior. Talal is not plagued by the feudal mentality. You think that Talal can adapt himself to this reality? Of course. He was raised here. - But his father... - We'll find him. - And when Talal's dad returns... - Enough about Talal. We're set for tomorrow, as we discussed. You're going back alone? Who did you come with? Some friends from Beirut. It must have been Ghazi. How is he? He's the same. I miss him. I wish he'd come. I wish you'd stay. - You mother is tough. - Yes, she is. It's going to be fine. The shoot was tough today. The fighters were magnificent. I wish you were there. I saw Talal. You went there? How are they? - Anything new with his father? - Still missing. Did you tell him? I didn't dare. I want to make sure first, and then be done with it. Do you think it's possible that... Want to try? It's my area, true... but I have heard nothing, I swear. I didn't hear about it until late, after the news had spread. Don't be modest, Abou Jaafar. I am sure that only you can save us. Listen, mister Talal. We were political opponents, and our paths were divergent. We were enemies in elections, but our personal relations were good. Let's not dwell on the past, let's talk about now. How can you help now? You mentioned money. That won't help. We're fighting for a cause. And besides, I am afraid of no one, except god. I'm not here to quarrel. Please just do the right thing. Your father is long gone. - So you know he's dead? - I know nothing. He's been missing for long. - It's been a month already. - It's a small region. We'll know the truth sooner or later. - We'll find out. - Are you here to threaten me? I've been patient. I won't allow this talk. The war won't last forever. Go look for him. If you can't find him... consider him a martyr. It's an honor to our area... - for your father to be a martyr. - It's too soon for this talk. We'll find the perpetrator eventually. What skill. Hi, pretty one. Time for you pill. Sister, I don't want any more pills. Enough already. This is a hospital, not a nightclub. Sorry, we're just bored. It's a boring life. - She's like a schoolteacher. - So sweet. Guys, I can't it take it anymore. Let's leave. Stay, it's still early. You know what? Let's all leave. This is no life. Sami, grab Hassane. - Where are you driving so fast? - Comrade, we have an injured passenger. It's pretty dead here. You must change your store front. It's dangerous. You better watch out. Please, give me a break. This is a cafe, not a military base. You take it down if you want. I've got my visa. - How are you? - Good. Get ready. I need you to sing some nice songs. Set the mood straight. "Nice songs"? People are bored. They need different songs. Exciting songs, political songs. War songs. - Nabil, please give me a break. - Listen to my advice. Yes, it's Nabil. As usual. Political party stuff. What? No. I'll stop by your place. You can't come here. No way. Don't you know where I am? Didn't they tell you? I'm at the front. Yes, the front. Can't you hear? Yes, it's bad. Don't worry. At your service. I'll come soon. Sure. You're full of it. Keep the struggle. Shoot if you dare. Shawki, come and fight. Calm down. Let's sort it out. No outsiders. Don't mess with me. I'll destroy you. You say you lost it? You're going to pay, or I'll kill you. You have 10 days. Saturday, 12:00 PM sharp. You'll be here with the money, or I'll come and find you. The amount of drugs you stole can supply the city for a whole month. Is Soraya in? Can you please move your car? We expect shelling tonight. We're out of cheese. Can you get me some please? Are you going to the front? I wish. I'm an only son. My mother would go mad. - Hello. - Hi. Want to try? Soraya, I love you. Talal, Joyce is leaving for good. Any news? Any progress? I must find him. I must... Give me some time. What about me? I love you. Can you hear me? How are you? I'm good. What's that? What about you? Look at me. I don't want to leave you here. Come with me. I'll miss you. Come with me. Why won't you? I can't hear you. You're crazy, completely crazy. Talal is crazy. What is he doing? He wants me to come. No way. Who's Selim anyway? Isn't he too young? He's one of our fiercest fighters. - How old are you? - 15. - Are you up to it? - Yes, sir. My Beirut friends don't get it. They can't relate. Beirut is far away. I know, but things have changed so fast. It seems you miss Beirut. Do you think he's alive? They had to withdraw. Abou Jaafar's defeat will set him back. He's more likely to cooperate now. Assuming he played a role in it. In any case, we've advanced, and that's crucial. What's this? What are you doing? Are you crazy? You're ruining us. You've wrecked the area. In one month, you've killed 5 men. You've ruined my alliances. We are not part of this war. We should look for your father. Playing war lord won't help. It's like you're trying your best... to wreck this family. You wrecked this family. You've made so many enemies. You have no allies. You've antagonized everyone for the sake of elections and power. What a rotten mentality. Feudalism wrecked you. Father is gone. Dead, gone. No. He is alive. Don't ever say that to me again. You've never loved him. You've never loved me. What a shame. Your father is alive, and you will find him. I swear, I am telling the truth. No matter. No one will believe you. I was cheated. There were no drugs. It was full of sand. Nabil, cut it off. You owe him 100,000. - His people are losing patience. - 100,000? If I had that much, I would run away. Please help. If it was up to me, I would. I can't change Shawki's mind. It's not fair. What a disaster. I'm fed up with this country. Shit, rubbish. I'm telling you, I am done. I am waiting for my visa. No talk, visa coming. I'll get my visa, and go to Canada. In Canada, I'll learn English. And then, United States, Oklahoma, Michigan, Houston, Texas. Anywhere I want, I'll go. I'll find a woman. We'll get married in a civil court. A couple of months, love man, green card. Sam Flifel, American citizen, and that's that. I'm troubled. - Ask me why. - Why? I'm in love. I'm in love with a special girl. Unbelievable girl. What to do? - Does she love you? - She is different from you and me. She has nothing to do with this shit. Soraya is not for you. Forget it. Not for me? Quit dreaming. She'll never love you. You are a very bad match. As if I were scum. Sami, am I scum? We all are. Yes, we're all scum. I'm done with all this. I want out. I want out. Sami, you are scum. Kamal, you're scum. And that guy... Scum. Hear me? You're scum. You and everyone else. Nabil, get out of here. - Who? - Open. Shut it, quick. - Nabil, your ear. - They want me dead. They're after me, they want me dead. Get me alcohol, anything you have. What happened? A special commando operation, to get me. Yes, me. Five or six of them... They almost got me. They surrounded me. I jumped off the balcony. Three stories. I ran and ran. They shot after me. I heard a missile. They want me dead. Hide me. Anywhere. Check if there's anyone down there. Just the usual guys. - Did you shut the door? - Yes. I am sure they're close. Why are they after you? It's complicated. Political differences. Your hand. I don't know. I'm dead. I'm such an idiot. I shouldn't have gone to the bar alone. Bar? What bar? Never mind. I thought I had more time. He said 10 days. Why is he in a hurry? If the idiot kills me, he'll never get his money. I don't care, kill me. I don't have the money. If he only knew... where I hid the stuff, he'd lose it. Nabil, you need to sleep. I'll get you a pill. - You're sure this is safe? - Yes. Sorry, wrong number. Let's try crossing. Can we cross now? No one can cross, not even Jesus Christ. They just crossed. The road is open for fighters, not for civilians. I have to go. You can't go. Can't you hear the guns? That pill is strong. Just relax. No, I have to go. I need to drop off the photos. Photos at this time? I guess you're right. - You need anything else? - No, thanks. Nabil, try to sleep. Quit it. This is a surprise. Didn't I ask you to come to my place? Some friend. A fair weather friend. Talal, please, give me a break. I'm in bad shape. - All this because Joyce dumped you? - Don't be mean, OK? - Look at you. You're drunk. - What's your problem? - Let's go, you're coming with me. - No. I don't want to. You have your issues, and I have mine. Let me be. - Are these yours? - Yes, so what? You've progressed. You're a politician, comrade... What's your war name? God help me. That's why you didn't come. Are you busy? - Did I meddle in your affairs? - I want you to. I asked you. You're my friend. Don't let me down. You want to shoot me? I've had enough of you and of Kamal, and Jihad. You're all fake. You're putting on a stage play. You know what? You're feudal lords, trampling on people. You move them like chess pieces. You are not my leader. You're my friend, that's all. You know what? I'm going to fight. Yes, I'll fight. With the other poor bastards... who have nothing to lose. Leave me. My brother was kidnapped. We kidnapped this man in return. If they don't release my brother, I'll kill him. It's you call. I think you should decide soon. The longer you wait, the harder it will be. You won't have to stay here. You'll rest for 2 hours... then you'll go home. It's hopeless. He won't make it. A bullet in the head. What can be done? What can be done? I don't know. They say the war might go on for years. They say it's a conspiracy. You hear? They say the big nations might divide us among themselves. I hope we're part of France's share. What station is this? A local station, from Lebanon. That young man is very smart. Do you know that de Gaulle once lived on this street? They won't leave us. Once they hear the news, they will come to our rescue. The Senegalese contingent will restore order. Do you know, dear... that a single Senegalese once closed down a whole square? But de Gaulle died a long time ago. No way. They would have said something on the radio. It's true. He died long ago. May you rest in piece, de Gaulle. Maybe his son can help us. Do you remember when I was little? When they brought you chocolate, you would hide it in my room... and then eat your sister's. Same with toys. You would hide your sister's toys, and lose yours. I was very naughty. No, you were just spoiled. Your father showered you with gifts. Your mom miscarried twice. They were afraid they'd be childless. So when you came, they were so thankful. Your mother suffered at childbirth. - We're heading to the front. - Come on, you fucker. Take care. This is my bed. Hello. I guess Sami forgot to tell you we're coming back. We really appreciate you keeping an eye on the house. One is comfortable only in one's house. We're tired of moving around. This young man kept an eye on the house. - Have coffee with us. - Mister Nabil... - Thank you. - There's no need. Having cake for breakfast? Getting fancy. You need 1 or 2 tonight? We don't know yet. - You owe me a tape. - Still working on it. Out of focus... Out of focus... - I can't print these. - It's not my fault. I did my best. I quit. Find someone else. I need a fan in the darkroom. And I need a new camera. I might as well shoot with a sewing machine. By the way, I found a good video camera. - It costs 1,100. - No. I can buy one from an American for 200. Let the boss know. You're really useless. - What have you done? - Is he dead? What have you done? Hurry up. Let's go. What happened? - The gun went off. - Is he dead? - Nabil? - No. Idiots. Idiots. Impossible. You can't ask this of me. I am powerless. No way. Talal is different. You haven't seen him lately, have you? He won't go along with it. He feels he fulfilled his duty. I can't take on this responsibility. I have stayed out of his affairs, just like he wanted. But things have come up in my life... and time is passing by. I can't wait any longer. Till when? What about me, me, me? I can't make promises. I'll call you back. It is hard to get here. - Can't I stay in my own home? - It's not your home. When was the last time you've come here? I know who's behind this. Tell your husband to say it to my face. I should never have accepted him. - I regret finding him a job. - He's right. No one can stand you. You're a disgrace. And that's not just my opinion. Talk, tell him. They're after me, they'll kill me. Hide me. If they find me, I'm dead. You will not stay here. You liar, you scum. - Take your filth elsewhere. - You're the one who's filthy. I'll kill you both. - Let go, you bastard. - I'll show you both. You'll see, it's either you or me. Go to hell. I hope you die. - Where have you been? - Let go. Calm down. Soraya is in the car. She wants to talk. They tried to kill me again. Again? Where? Why? They got someone else by mistake. It must be political. You're too involved politically. You need to stay away from it. It's dangerous. Nabil, I need your help. Is that why we're here? I need you... for an important personal matter. Don't say no. Talk. I know you can help. Only you can. I am sure you can do it. What is it? We'll kidnap someone. What? That's not a game. This is very serious. I'll explain. Talal is opposed to this project. Talal is not looking for his father anymore. He just won't admit it yet... for his mother's sake. This trade idea might work... if he is still alive. The man we're targeting is a good match. He is well known, with good connections. Here he is. Do you trust the people who will do it? Yes, I've known them for a long time. Be careful. I won't be there. If it fails, it'll be a disaster. Are you scared? What if he's really dead? He'll avenge him. Who from? Anybody. It does not matter. Come back here. I'll get you candy. Come back. Why did you bring your brother? - Take him. - Who was he going to stay with? No shooting. Don't hurt him. Sit next to him. Let's go. A checkpoint. Go back. The road is closed. I want to go home. I know this place. Turn the lights on. The music. Turn the music on. I can't take it anymore. I want to see. Calm down. I talked to a doctor. - He told me you'll be fine. - You're lying. I can't see. I can't see. It's all blurry. No. No. It can't be. My eyes. Calm down. My eyes. My eyes. You need to resolve your issues with Shawki. Let's get rid of that guy. Everyone's looking for him. He might be the answer to Shawki. What do you mean? We return the man for some money, and we pay Shawki back. And the beik? Never mind him. You might not care, but I do. We promised Soraya. You're idiots. The beik is probably already dead. He's long gone already. I can't. I promised her. Our lives are on the line. We get the money, and we pay the debt. We need the money. Chawki will kill all of us. The deadline is tomorrow at noon. He expects his money, or else. Fix that wall. I want this to become a shrine. Talal beik, you mother. What are you doing here? Shame on you. You don't have the right. Why do you think he is dead? Tell me. Do you have proof? No, you don't. You're being cruel. He's kidnapped, and we'll find him. Why have you changed? You've always told me... "This is your place, your land..." "You have to to assume its leadership." Well, here I am. What more do you want? Be reasonable. Stop this nonsense. Be a leader, not a war lord. Don't lose hope. Keep looking for him. I am sure he is still alive. Should we abandon him? Dig his grave? And when he's back, what do we do? Dig. Dig. Who will you bury? I know how to defend this family. I know how to avenge it. He's dead. Wake up already. You're crazy. Soraya is here. I missed you. I've never missed you this much. Me too. There is something important I have to tell you. - Is it about Ghazi? - No, I haven't seen him. It's about your father. My father? We'll know in two days. I already told you to stay out of it. People in Beirut are helping. He is dead. Get it? - Let me explain. - Please, don't. If you don't get it, who will? I will not spend my life looking for a dead man. He's dead, gone. He's alive, and we're going to find him. Enough already. We've already planned his funeral. Can you please move on? Forget it. Forget it. I can't, because I know what that means. Talal, I'm pregnant. Liar. It's not true. You don't love me. Where is everyone? What have you done to him? As agreed, at the front... The trade is not today; It's tomorrow. Nabil said so. Where are they? I swear I don't know. Where to? This is a restricted area. - She is completely crazy. - Let her go. What is happening? Where's Nabil? Here they come. Get him. Stay close to me. Easy now. Easy. Nabil, stop. Let him go. Go. Go. Stop. Get closer. Get down. Watch it. Watch him. Get up. Let's go. Those sons of bitches... Be careful now. - Let them get closer. - OK. No, Nabil. No. Nabil, it's ruined. Let's leave. Sami, don't die. Soraya, please help. It's not my fault. You used me. It's not my fault. Please help me. You used me. Soraya, I love you. Don't leave. I love you. Now I get it. You're with them. You want to kill me too. She lost a lot of blood. - Internal bleeding. It's serious. - Is she in danger? It's our fault. We didn't believe her. We didn't think she was pregnant. We thought she was spinning tales. No, she was serious. What happened? How is she? They wouldn't let me in. I want to see her. Calm down. You can't see her yet. I'll explain. I'm off to Saudi Arabia. Yes, the airport. What would I stay for? Talal doesn't need me. I'm dispensable. It didn't work out. I don't know. He is looking for something, but it isn't his father. Yes, I have a cousin in Riad. I'll work with him. 25,000 dead, and 60,000 injured... and the world looks the other way, preoccupied by other matters. Let's go. It's time to go. The heroic martyr, Jaya'. What do you want? The heroic martyr, Nabil Sourour. It's from Soraya. You want anything? Need anything? Get lost, now. Leave, go. Will they be expecting us? I called them today. The airport. The airport, quick.
