In space, no one can hear you yawn. Yeah go ahead and play it Tess. TESS: Here it comes. Good day. 32 hours ago, our monitoring station on Quad-L detected a transmission in an unregistered frequency emanating from the asteroid Vesta. TRYBULL: Our analysts have not yet determined its nature, but in all likelihood, it's probably just radioactive venting from beneath the asteroid's surface. Normally we classify this as an anomaly and give it no further notice. However recent intelligence indicates the Confederation may be developing a transmission protocol that disguises itself as natural geologic emissions. TRYBULL: On the off-chance this is such a transmission and the Confederation has established a base on Vesta, we need you to swing by TRYBULL: and do a complete thermal scan. OTTO: Thermal scan. TRYBULL: Of the asteroid's surface. This is probably nothing, but we need you to take a look anyway. TRYBULL: You folks are doing a great job out there. Keep it up. That is all for now. Nova initiate an OMS Gimbal Test and prep for burn. Mid-deck retract solar arrays and stow your antennae, HUNTER: And switch to sub-M telemetry. You copy that? Roger. OTTO: Roger that.

One of the disciples turns to Peter and says, "What the heck does that mean?" Peter says, "Eh, don't worry. It's just another one of his parabolas." Get it? Parabolas?

It's the end of a long tour. I understand but when people get too familiar, people start slackin' off, taken' liberties. OTTO: So the kings decide to send their knights out to do battle, right? But at the camp of the third king, there's only one knight and his squire. OTTO: So the squire decides to take a large pot, and he hangs it with a looped rope from a tall tree. I suppose. I just remember when I was down there, I used to- HUNTER: There are two kinds of leaders. Those that lead by being everybody's best friend, and those that lead by being a little bit of an asshole. You like to be everybody's friend. HUNTER: I, on the other hand, am an asshole. Because when push comes to shove, a crew will always do more for an asshole than a buddy, hm? So that just proves that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the squires of the other two sides. [LAUGHS] OTTO: Get it? The squires of the other two sides? I don't get it.

TESS: Data packet banked. Verification complete. All right let's hear it. TRYBULL: Good day. The craft status data you transmitted has been analyzed, and the news is not good. TRYBULL: You have complete loss of pressure in your A-3, A-4, and A-5 cryogenic O2 tanks. Under normal conditions this leaves you with approximately 60 hours of breathable air. TRYBULL: Unfortunately, our most favorable calculations estimate that you will meet up with the TRYBULL: rescue craft at not sooner than 91 hours. We've gone through the numbers repeatedly, TRYBULL: but we keep coming up with the same inescapable conclusion. TRYBULL: You will run out of air before we can reach you. TRYBULL: However, it is important for you to realize TRYBULL: that these figures are based on four crew members. TRYBULL: If in the next 30 hours the number of crew members were reduced by two, TRYBULL: the survivability of the remaining two is highly favorable. TRYBULL: Let me state it more bluntly: if within the next 30 hours TRYBULL: two of you have not ceased consuming oxygen, none of you will survive this mission. TRYBULL: Thankfully, if you do decide to reduce your crew size, we can assure you TRYBULL: the crimson capsule that each of you carry in the pocket of your flight suit TRYBULL: offers an instant and painless termination of life functions. TRYBULL: As to determining which two of you, if any, survive, TRYBULL: that's a choice only the four of you can make. TRYBULL: In that time, we will need you to burn off the rest of your hydrogen propellant TRYBULL: to maximize speed, further assuring the safe return of the surviving crew. TRYBULL: We await notification of your decision, TRYBULL: that our thoughts and prayers are with you. [MESSAGE BEEPING] All right, let's uh, let's just take a moment here to collect our thoughts a minute before we figure out how we're going to do this. Pardon? HUNTER: So everybody just remain calm, maybe have a drink of water- OTTO: Uh, excuse me Hunter? Do what exactly? HUNTER: I think it's pretty obvious from that message that we're gonna have some very difficult decisions to make. OTTO: I'm sorry um, can we just take a minute, uh, and - and maybe discuss this for a second? I don't think the situation leaves us much to talk about, do you? OTTO: So what, no discussion, no anything? Well what is there to discuss? OTTO: I don't know about anyone else, but I sure wouldn't mind taking a minute to discuss our options here. TESS: Yeah, I need a moment or two to absorb this. Well unless someone knows a way of coaxing a metric ton of vented oxygen back into a ruptured oxygen tank, I don't know what you expect us to do. No, I'm sorry. Look, we gotta do something. We could - we could do an EVA. Go outside, maybe go back to the service module, and see if we can repair some of the damage. HUNTER: I don't like this any more than you do, but there's nothing we can do. HUNTER: And an EVA isn't gonna solve anything. The air is gone. And the sooner we accept that, the better off we'll be. I mean we don't even know HUNTER: the condition of the other tanks. OTTO: I'm going crazy here. It's me, right? It's - it's - it's all me? I'm go-I'm the crazy one? HUNTER: Look, as I was saying, we don't know the condition of the other tanks. HUNTER: And we could lose another one before this is all over. HUNTER: And for that reason, whatever decision we make, we need to make it fast. That's why we should do an EVA. I'm sorry, but once the crew cabin is sealed, it is against regulations to unseal it. Regulations? You're gonna quote regulations at a time like this? Regulations are regulations for a reason. If the airlock is damaged and we can't reseal it, HUNTER: we could lose all the air we do have. OTTO: And I - I'm - I'm just asking questions here, all right? We're still allowed to do that right? Ask questions? This isn't a dictatorship? Questions. Like how did a class-N spinner get within 100 kilometers of us without anyone noticing? Hunter, this isn't the time. OTTO: Whoa, whoa, wait a second here. Are you trying to say that this is all my fault? OTTO: No this is crazy, cause I was sitting right there at my station OTTO: looking directly at the scopes. NOVA: Okay, let's just stop right here, okay? Pause. Everybody just settle down for a second. NOVA: Now I understand Hunter's point. I totally agree about the EVA. Gone is gone. But with all due respect Major, I'm not sure this is a situation in which the most conservative course of action is the most appropriate. I don't see any reason why we can't take a little bit of time, and double-check all of our figures. Explore all of our options. HUNTER: What's the point? The point? The point is we'll know. I'd hate to make it back home and not be certain that I did everything I could to make sure that the most amount of people made it back alive. I say we go over all of our numbers, double-check our math, do fault checks on - on the sensors and the monitors, make sure that we are operating from a reliable and accurate source of information. OTTO: That's all I'm asking for. NOVA: At the same time- we recognize that we need to set a time limit. We don't wanna compromise whatever cushion we have for those making it back. Fine. How does that all sound to you, Hunter? You have an hour. An hour. One hour. Okay. Okay, that's good. That's enough time. NOVA: Okay then, Tess, I need you to run redundant checks on all the sensors to determine reliability. Otto, start redistributing all the oxygen into the good tanks. And check out those chemical oxygen generators that didn't fire. Roger. Hunter and I will go over our consumption numbers and see what we can come up with there. No rock left unturned. Roger. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ TESS: That's what I'm saying. We're getting dead readings on A-3 and A-4, so we know there's no oxygen in those. But we're only getting an error on A-5. So we don't know if it's empty or not. Although it most likely is. What's the error? SN-909. General sensor error. Could be the valve, could be that it's offline. The tank could be full of O2? Well I doubt that. I mean it is right next to A-3 and A-4, so most likely it's vented out along with those. Well yeah, but we don't know. The only way to know would be to go out there and do a visual check. To put a gauge on the release valve and check it. You heard Hunter. No EVA. I know, I know. [WHISPERING Did you hear what she said? [WHISPERING What? When she was talking to Hunter, she said she wants to know that we did everything we can to make sure the most people make it back to base with us. She said "we" as in her and Hunter. I don't think she said that. No, she definitely said "we." Now it might have been a slip of the tongue, but I think that's what she's thinking. - What are you talking about? - Don't you see it? See what? Are we taking into account whatever extra oxygen Otto can find? NOVA: So they're figuring 240 man-hours of air. That's where they get the 60 hours from. 240 divided by 4, but for 3 people that's 80 hours. HUNTER: So nothing's changed. I'm sorry Hunter, I get the impression that you're angry with me. I didn't think that I was- HUNTER: I'm not angry. I - I just think that when we have discussions with the crew, we need to respect a proper chain of command. You sort of painted me into a corner there by suggesting that we jump through all these hoops and getting everybody's hopes up for what appears to be little use. Hunter, I'm sorry but right now there is no chain of command. There are four human beings fighting for their lives. There is always a chain of command. Without a chain of command we are just animals.

OTTO: That way everybody is part of the conversation. Uh, everybody's kept in the loop? Yeah, that's good. Absolutely, sure. NOVA: Uh, no one has secrets around here. Yeah that way no one gets paranoid. True. Um, there's something else that would be a good idea. Um, now that it looks like we're getting closer to the time we have to decide things. I think we should start thinking about taking precautions, you know, for our safety. What kind of precautions? NOVA: Well first thing is, I think that we should um, disarm our weapons, NOVA: pull the clips, put them in a place where they're inaccessible. Not - I'm not saying that I think things are gonna get weird, but I don't know, I just think it's a good idea. I don't know how I feel about that. If the enemy intercepts us, we're gonna need to protect ourselves. Yeah, but what are the chances? Well nobody can say, but I don't feel comfortable. Well I think if you weighed the safety and security of the crew against enemies unknown, I think the safety has to win out. OTTO: Wait a second. You guys carry the AL-4's, right? Yeah right. We carry the AL-2's. Why don't we just swap ammunition? OTTO: You know, we can't fire with your cartridges, you can't fire with ours. But at the same time, they're still accessible. All right. That sounds good. Okay? Um, let's pass each other our ammo. HUNTER: Now we're running out of time to decide. It's up in - HUNTER: well it expired about two minutes ago. So we're really doing this, huh? I guess we are. Yeah. It's about that time. So how are we gonna do it? I don't know. There's - there's no procedure for this sorta thing. OTTO: Hey um, look I just don't want it to be done by any kind of competition, you know, like a - a chess game or tic-tac-toe or anything, cause - cause I suck at that shit. No, we'll - we'll do it completely by random. We'll uh, flip a coin or something. Well maybe not a coin, but something with two different sides. Uh, that way everybody will think it was fair. OTTO: This is crazy. I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe this is my life. It just doesn't seem real. HUNTER: But it is. And we know that. And we can't deny our situation any longer. Okay. Um, I really hate to say this, but I think this is - it's a good idea at this point if we want to record a message NOVA: for anyone back home, that we do it now. We don't know how this is all gonna turn out, NOVA: So I say that everyone does one before we do anything, before we make any decisions. Otto, what are you doing? Otto.

But I can't pull another checker out of the bag, I just can't. HUNTER: It's the only way to do it. I mean if we have a better idea, I'd love to hear it. I do have an idea, and I should've done it from the beginning. TESS: I'm putting on a flight suit, TESS: and I'm going back into the service module to check the air in A-5. I can't allow that.

Nothing. No reading. Shit! We're totally fucked! That was half of our air supply! This is all your fault! If we had just let her back in, none of this would've happened. Don't put that on me. That was your decision! You decided to lock the hatch! You pressured me into it. I didn't wanna do it. Why did I ever listen to you? Since when did any of you listen to me? If you all had just done what I told you to do from the very beginning, we wouldn't be in this mess. My command was subverted at every turn, and now there's only enough oxygen for one of us!
