It's the longest one I've had so far you know? Wow dude, three months, you're really pushing it. Hey, shut up. Why don't you just get Aiden to give you a ride in his little Wonder mobile. Go ahead and try it again. I don't get it. I mean, you say you're poor but you drive this money suck around. Yeah. Well, it was cheap. And I'm gonna need it in Savannah. Not to mention I really haven't had to spend much on repairs yet. Right, because gas is cheap. Feel free to chip in. Alright, try it again. Yes. I'm just not interested in Derek's party, Jack. Ya know, I got to get up early. Look, can you just give me a ride over there? Whoa, where are we going? Parson's asked some of the photo club to go to Claire's funeral. Claire? What? It's not that big a deal, man. Aiden, I'm not even dressed for this. Lose the jersey, you'll be fine. Fine, I'll take you to the damn party. You're giving me gas money, though. Let us now pray. Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come Thy will be done On Earth as it is in Heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen Amen What are we even doing here, man? We were laughing at these people a year ago. It's not that bad. Just be careful. Derek's not someone I'd pick to be my new best bud. Look, if you come in, I'll make sure no one says anything messed up Okay? Your stupid hat got owned! You're not getting out of this. Everybody, Jack Spencer! Thank you all for coming out tonight because tomorrow's big game! I want to say thank you to the man of the hour here mister Jack Spencer who's the only bastard crazy enough to hold onto the ball while not only getting a concussion but breaking his arm in, not one, but two places! Alright, so let's give this crazy bastard another beer and a big thank you because if a wasn't for him We would not be kicking the Falcons asses tomorrow! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! I didn't even call her, I just needed a break tonight, you know? Why, does she still have you doing that cuddling crap? Oh my God, come on! Dude, you deserve better than that. You're freaking hero here. She doesn't like football. Well then let me introduce you to Nancy, man She's been wanting to talk to you all night. I don't think so No, come on, man. Let me introduce you She's a real sweetheart. Just just be careful with her. She's a she's a little fragile. Ah- Come on, man. Heroes don't jerk off. Hey Derek, where's Fisher at. He didn't come? Naw he didn't. He's probably just resting up for the game tomorrow. You know me and Aiden, we saw him at the funeral of that girl Ah, what's her name, Aiden, you know her- Claire White. That's it, Claire White. You guys went to that? She was really weird. I heard she did porn. (Laughing) What? Yeah, like she was naked in a whole bunch of skanky pictures. I'm ready to go. Let's go. Um... where did you say that I could sleep again? Uh, guest bedroom. Door's right there. You ready? Actually, Aiden, I was thinking, um... probably just going to crash here tonight. If that's cool. Oh, yeah, man, totally. Yeah. Aiden. Oh, hey Ami. Have you seen Jack today? Why is something wrong? I just haven't seen him all morning. We're supposed to have dinner last night. I think his dad dropped him off today. Maybe he had a doctor's appointment or something. What's up there little guy. Fancy seeing you here. Dude, I thought Aiden was the biggest fag I knew but at least he came to the party last night. Man, you should have came. Could have got laid. You had a party? Yeah, what, Jack didn't tell you? Yeah, Jack probably didn't tell her because Jack didn't go because he had that doctor's appointment this morning. Right. Yeah. Sorry Ami. I think I'm actually gonna get going. Good luck with the game tonight guys. See ya, Aiden. Aiden, hey, listen man I'm really sorry- Listen, you didn't go to that party last night. You had to get up early and go to your doctor's appointment this morning. Your dad dropped you off at school. You got me? Yeah. You're damn right you do. Hey. You cheap bastard. Look man I've been trying to say this all day. So just let me finish, okay? I messed up. Put you in a messed up situation and I shouldn't have done that so I'm sorry, okay? And I'll never do it again There it is. Happy now? Are you going to tell Ami? No. Look, man, I was drunk. Okay. You weren't that drunk. Hey, thanks for the shitty camera. Pass is complete, intended for number thirty-four, Mike Fisher. Jesus Christ, Fisher! I didn't get it here for you to drop the ball. How'd you miss that one man? Huh, Mike, how did you drop that? Fisher answer me? You're pathetic man. Come on, Jack. Come on. You're a failure. Can you believe that, man? All those practices. Should be in the championship game next week, Aiden. Fisher, god... You mind waiting up a second? I forgot something in the photo lab. It's 11 o'clock, Aiden. It's closed. Parson's gave me a key. That's great. You alright, man? Yeah, are you ready? Jesus Christ, man. I think you get a kick out of sneaking up on the handicapped. Yeah, it gives me a sense of power. (Laughs) Dickhead. What's the for? Just finishing off the roll. Don't look at the camera. Okay. Who's that? No one. Oh, yeah That no one Shut up. I told you I'm through with that girl. Yeah, what're you looking for in that yearbook? Pictures of yourself? Ha ha. Right. Yeah, I'd believe you Except you'd never just admit it. Everyone keeps making a big deal about that girl who died Claire. I don't remember her. I think you'd remember her If you'd met her. She signed one of my get well cards. I just thought that was weird cause I never met her, you know. They passed those around the entire class, dude. I don't know. I went to school with her all this time and I don't even know what she looks like. Do you think that's weird? I think it's weird that you'd think about it. Yeah. Shut up. What, she's not in there? No man, I've been looking through this thing. I think she was just absent on picture day. You still have that class panorama? That was a different day. Right. Right, right, right. There's me. There's you. Oh, she's right there. What is she looking at-? It's weird. You see that right? Yeah. It's weird. So you don't know Honestly, you have no clue whatsoever if she liked me. Honestly I had that one class with her, dude. She really didn't talk about much at all. What about the photo? You don't think that was weird. She was looking right at me. It's a little weird. I think it's a lot weirder that you care about it so much. Come on man, you saw it too. Who else could it be? Here comes miss Sally What is that? Back from your smoke break. New merchandise. Are you vlogging now? Yeah, a little. Lame. Well, you know you want to be in it. No, not at all. Ok, ok, cool, thanks. I'll credit you. Yeah, give me that shit. Oh Claire. Whatcha got there Claire bear? Nothing. It doesn't look like nothing. Oh, it's a rather expensive nothing. Is that for the mystery man? Maybe. Have you even talked to him? That's none of you business. Ah, you have to tell me something about him. Come on, he's got to be better than the last asshole. You liked the last asshole. Thanks Claire. Did you know that girl Claire? The dead girl? Yeah. No. Why? I heard she had a thing for a football player. You're not playing dumb with me are you Jack? No, what are you talking about? Did someone say something to you? Or did she say something to you? I didn't even know her. Just the football player thing. And some pictures. Why would you even ask me about that? I'm just wondering why her name is on your cast. I don't know, man, signing a cast? Come on. How many people signed that thing, anyway? Look, just hear me out. She had to have done it while I was out. The nurse said that a bunch of people came by after the game and signed my cast while I was knocked out. Look it's one thing to sign someone's get well card but to drive all the way to the hospital and sign their cast. Come on. Why do you even want to go there Jack? You didn't know her. Girls like you and you know it. What makes Claire any different? I don't know she's dead. Look, I can't explain it It just changes things Besides, Nancy said she had a thing for a football player I just thought it was me. The hell you talking to Nancy for? Swear to god, man. You need to end it that girl or she's gonna own you. What the hell do you know about women, Aiden? Really? That's low, asshole. You're right, man. I'm sorry Hey, this one's nice. You take it. No. Who did? I don't remember. For god's sake, Jack The assignment was to take pictures of the sports teams. You were bound to show up on one of them. Jack, you can't just take that. I did something today I've never done before. I went to the Sunken City before dawn. It's this old neighborhood from the 1930s that had to be relocated before it fell into the sea. These bits of road and houses it right on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. I was alone and I wanted it that way. I think it's something you have to do twice. once for yourself just to have done it and appreciated it and once with a friend for them. Because once you've seen the sunrise over the Sunken City. It's selfish to keep it to yourself. I already know who I'll share it with. Jack, seriously, these are good. Why didn't you tell me you sketched? Kinda just got busy with football. My mom is really into the arts and stuff She wanted me to stick with it. Why didn't you? Because it would have made her happy. You should keep at it. That sounds like you, Jack. Never finishing things. What was that about? We were supposed to work on a chemistry project together. Forgot some research. Don't you dare- -Jesus, Jack- -pull some shit like that in front of Ami ever again? Do you understand what I'm saying, Nancy? You only answer the phone when it's good for you, Jack? Well not going to be answering it anymore. We're done. Do you understand? We're done. That sounds like a dangerous conflict of interest. See I'm not so interested in being done. If we're done Then maybe Ami will decide She's done too. You bitch, it was a one night- Listen, you arrogant little prick I put up with your dumb-as-a-brick girlfriend but I'll be damned if I sit around and let you use me and toss me aside. We're done when I say we're done You do what I say we do. And right now I say we have a date tonight. I can't tonight. I plans with Ami I can't meet you tonight, it's impossible- What do you want? One thing, Jack, and it ain't your brains. Hey Jack, it's Ami Uh, I don't know where you are or why you're not answering your phone, but um, the lasagna's getting cold and mom wants to start and I really hope you're close. Call me back. Bye. Hey, Ami, Can I borrow your chem notes again? Look, Ami, I'm sorry. I fell asleep and my phone was on silent. I'll make it up to you. You know I will. Thanks. Hey Jack. Hey. Everything. All right? Yeah. No, I think I might've screwed up. I'm sure you two will be fine. You're a good guy. She's lucky to have you. I'm not a good guy, Stacey. I'm an asshole. Well, you've always been really nice to me If you ever need to talk or anything. Yeah. Heyoo. Hey sweetie. Hey, what's going on? Um, Jack was just asking if I've seen Ami around. Right. I haven't, have you? Uh, uh. Why, is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks, guys. It's not just for me, it's for Ami. Are you out of your damn mind, Jack? I don't have a choice here. I've already told her to back off and I can't trust anyone else. I need this favor. I'm not gonna hurt someone for you. This is ridiculous. I'll talk to you later. How much? What? Let's cut the crap. You're not dealing anymore. You need money in other ways. So how much, Aiden? That's insulting. Sorry. Ah, checking out Sally there, Big J? No, man, I just zoned out. Yeah, good, she's a bitch. Dang, when are they gonna take that thing down it's giving me the creeps. It doesn't really bother me. Hey, here comes your boyfriend. Hey, man. Thanks for letting me borrow it. I'm just sorry I kind of took it without asking. It's alright, man. Hey, just a little heads up. Nancy's been looking for you, buddy. Funny what I'll make you use your phone, Jack. I don't think you've ever called me before. What you got there? Dear mom and dad learning lots and school. Love Nancy. Oh, I think they'll be impressed. I mean in I was. It's a great shot. I mean, look at the focus. You can definitely tell that's you. Look you dumb bitch If Ami ever finds out. I'm just going to assume it was you. Then your parents grandparents Pastor Ted Every locker in the school will get their own personal copy I mean it made extras. Do we have an understanding? Bye Nancy. So did it work? I think so. Was it really for Amy? Remember Amber Norman? Yeah, the girl you dated in middle school 7th grade most of 8th grade that was before you Um Before I told anybody. Right There was no before aside from that. Right. I knew how I felt when I was with her. when I found out she was moving I just decided I'd stay with her until she did. Why? Because then she wouldn't get hurt. You know, and if people made fun of her At least she'd be gone already. So yeah, I helped. But for Ami, not for you. Well either way I owe you one. Thanks. You don't owe me anything. If you want to do me a favor don't drag me into this again. I won't. So what about Ami? (inaudible) Yeah, these are the ones that were floating around school last year. Surprised you never saw them before. Why would anyone send them to you now? I don't know. Maybe someone who knew that she had a thing for me You don't even know if she did. Why else would they send them though? Yeah, these were taken with a digital camera not film anyone could have taken them. I'm going to find out who. Jack. Seriously, it's not worth your time. Doesn't even matter now anyway. It matters to me. She was my best friend. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm sorry she's dead. You knew what I meant. I need to ask you about Claire. Why? You knew her best, right? The guy she went out with a while back the one who took the photos and put them online Who is he? What kind of question is that? You looking to score some copies? No, I already have some. Someone emailed it to me last night to mess with me. What would pictures of Claire have anything to do with you? I don't know. She wouldn't say. She was your best friend she didn't tell you who she was seeing? She never told me about any of her boyfriends actually. Used to really pissed me off. She wouldn't name names so no one actually knows. She wouldn't say after he did it either. She was a good person like that. I'd have slit his throat. Thanks. She's dead, Jack. So whatever this is, this thing with the pictures. Be careful. She was already humiliated once. Don't let it happen again. Did you find anything? Aiden do you really think this is all nothing? I don't really know Jack. I think the better question is What difference does it make? You know, it probably doesn't make a difference but Aidan, you know usually I couldn't care less but this just I don't know. Aidan, did you ever give her anything? Did you ever sell her anything? No. Never. Okay. Hey, man, will you do me a favor? What's that? You had a class with her, right? Yeah. You must have talked to her or something. Tell me what she was like. I mean I didn't really know her that well. She was quiet. Kind of always in her own headspace but I mean if you talked to her, she'd talk to you. She seemed very sweet. She always wore those old vintage dresses. It's kind of a trademark for her Photography was definitely a thing though. She was really good. (overlapping) I asked her what kind of music she liked once... (overlapping) ...much better than me for sure... (overlapping) ...she said anything by the 27 club... (overlapping) I never saw her with anyone but Sally... People used to call them the sisters. They were they were always together. Then it seemed like something happened between them. Not sure what. I don't know it seemed like I didn't see them together again for a while. Evening, Aiden. Derek sends his love. Oh my god, Aiden. Aiden, are you okay, man? Yeah. Oh my god. Why the hell would he do this? Nancy told him. That fucking bitch- He's been looking for an excuse to hit me since I quit dealing anyway, This is the way it had to be. I'm neutral ground. No no no he's going to pay for this man- Listen Fucking think about it for a second. You have the photos of Nancy. They can't touch you, right? They'll tell Ami, so you can't touch them. This is the way it has to be. It's done. I'm fine. Nothing else. Okay, You done? Can you be done? Okay. Good. That camera cost a hundred and fifty bucks. Aiden, this isn't a fair, man. You're telling me it's not fair. Of course it's not fair. God, Jack. Aiden. Aiden, I'm sorry man. Aiden. I'd been sober for like two years Aiden I've been waiting for you. Why, what's wrong? Do you know what's going on with Jack this whole drunk driver thing. He's been reading through these articles all morning. I can't get him to talk about anything else. Jack Aiden Listen to this Burns was driving in 99 Honda Accord That's the same car he had at the cemetery the prick shows up in the same fucking card that he hit her with and now he's out on bail and he's working. Jack, I need my notes back test is this afternoon. Aiden, it was his third fucking DUI and he still had his license. Jack, please stop. Seriously man, this is getting out of hand. Someone should have done something, Aiden- Damn it, Ami. Fine, you want the notes take the notes. Jesus. Claire White. You knew her? Hand it over. I was just asking- Don't me talk to me, you failure. Go fuck yourself, Jack. You know, no one's impressed anymore man. It's football. It's a game. No one cared ten minutes after the ball hit the ground except for you. Look, I'm over it and obviously you're not and for that, I feel sorry for you. She took my backpack. You're really not gonna let this go, Jack? Are you going to tell me how unhealthy all this is? I think you already know that. Bam. Woah, what's the occasion? It's our three month anniversary It's the longest one I've had so far, you know? Oh, what the hell? You knew it was Derek. Oh Jesus, fuck off, Jack. Why did you lie? Who the fuck are you? Huh? Like you're proud of everything you've ever done. This your idea of a joke? Yeah. Yeah, actually it is and you would think it's pretty funny too if you hadn't been acting so fucking weird lately. Who did Claire have a thing for when she died? I don't know. You're lying. She wouldn't say. She was your best friend. Not after Derek, okay? She wouldn't tell me shit after that. Because you took him from her. Come on, he's gotta be better than the last asshole. You liked the last asshole. Thanks, Claire. Because she was a prude Jack. She wouldn't put out. I would. It's the oldest reason there is. You don't steal Derek from anyone he comes looking for it. Why did you do that to her? What do you care? Answer me! Oh, you are not in the position to be pushing me right now, Jack. You wouldn't want to make Ami unhappy now would you? You throw that at me I've got more copies and an explanation for Stacey. You wanna know the truth Jack? Nothing happened. All I did was take pictures, man. Yeah, I treated Claire like shit, okay? I've treated a lot of girls like shit. What I have with Stacey's real, so don't fuck with that. Why the photos? She wouldn't give. He wanted to humiliate her so he got her stoned and took the pictures. I never talked to him again after that. Why did you send them? Because you messed with Nancy, okay? It's the best I could come up with. And Aiden? Oh, he had it coming. Touch him again and I'm gonna break you in half do you understand? You boyfriend isn't so perfect, Jackie boy. Why didn't you tell me when I first asked you? Because he was your friend. Jack. Ami, hey I was looking for you. Look I'm really sorry- We're going to dinner tonight. the Aloha Steakhouse. Ami, I'm sorry, I don't think I can- You're coming. It's our anniversary and you owe me. This is your last chance. Anniversary, right. Yeah, I'll be there. Seven o'clock. See you tonight. Hey. Ami, you look beautiful. Thanks, babe. Is that for me? Yeah Table's ready. I invited some of our friends. You don't mind do you? It's not our anniversary, is it? No. Enjoy your meal. I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't tell her. I got a note. It said it was from you. I thought- I thought maybe you wanted to- I didn't know, Jack I swear to God I didn't know. I didn't know Derek was going to do that to Aiden, either. I told him because I was scared, I didn't- I don't have to stop hitting him but he just he wouldn't stop. I didn't think he would tell Ami. He said it was over. I thought you were even. I thought you two were done. Jack. I'm sorry, man. I just heard. You don't want to talk about it at all. No. Seriously Jack, don't ignore me. Let's talk about this. I'm busy, Aiden. Bullshit, Jack. You're just sit there sulking. What is this, Aiden, your big play? Swoop in and comfort me. Catch me on the rebound. Maybe you've been waiting for this. Never not in the ten years I've known you have I ever. I'll let that one go. Don't you ever say that shit to me again. Hey Jack. Hey, Stacey, how are you? Good. How are you? I heard about you and Ami. Yeah, she just wasn't happy, you know? and I just really want her to be happy so... Yeah, That's- That's really mature. Thanks. Well look I gotta go catch the bus, but it was good seeing you. Oh, don't you normally ride with Aiden? Yeah, but Aiden's got stuff after school today so- Oh, I can give you a ride. I mean, I don't want to bother you. No, yeah, no it's fine. I just need to find my keys really quickly. Thanks Yeah. You look great in that skirt, by the way. Hey there. Hey. You want to come with me my locker real quick. Just take a quick sec, okay? Look, I don't want this to be complicated. I'm with Derek. I want to be with Derek. I just- Hey, hey, look, I totally get it. I get it. I get it. I'm not trying to get in the middle of anything either. Okay? I just need to show you something. It's in here somewhere. Is this is going to be a while? I have class. No no no, it's only going to take a sec. Hey Jack, here I am. What do you want? You know what, babe, you're right. That birthmark does look like a little seashell. Jesus Christ, Jack. What the hell did you do? You can't do that shit people, man. You took the photos for me, okay? That was to help you and Ami. Stacey's a sweet girl. She never did anything to you. Oh, she did things. Listen, you sick fuck you are seriously hurting people. Says the former drug dealer, right? I sold pot. That shit never hurt anybody. I did what I did to get back at Derek. I thought you could appreciate that Okay? Yeah, Derek's an asshole. But even he didn't deserve that. The hell he didn't. Derek got what he deserved. I did what I did for me you Ami and Claire. What the hell does Claire have to do with any of this? Sally? I need to talk to you. You need sleep. When was the last time you saw Claire? God, Jack This is getting really sick and I'm not the only one who's noticed. Sally, please. Well, you know you want to be in it. No. Not at all. Oh, okay, cool, thanks. I'll credit you. Yeah, give me that shit. Saturday night the night before she died. Dide she say anything about her plans for Sunday like what she was gonna do- She said she was going to see her mystery guy said she had something for him a surprise. What you got there Claire bear? Nothing. Oh, it's a rather expensive nothing. Couple picture frames, rolls of film One of those, uh little cases you keep like a bracelet or a necklace in from that place in the mall Answered Prayers That place that does the engravings, right? Yeah, I saw the bag on her locker, but, I don't know. Is that when she was killed going to see him? Yeah. Aiden. Aiden, come on, man. I'm sorry, okay? I need a favor. You shit out of favors with me, Jack. You're the only one who can help me. I need some film developed. Where is it? I don't have it yet. What? Look, I just need to get it first, okay? Well, where is it? Look, don't worry about that I'll get it to you by tonight. No. It has to be now or I'm not doing it. It's in her locker. Whose locker? Her locker? Are you fucking nuts? Keep your voice down. How are you going to get in? You have the combination? No, I don't. No? No fucking way man. Absolutely not. And since I won't do it you have no reason to so don't. Look, I'll pay you- I don't need your fucking money. Come on, Aiden. I know you need the money. Okay? No. Not that badly, Jack. Otherwise I just would have kept selling. Why is that, Aiden? What? Why'd you stop selling? I know you still need the money. I... I didn't want people to get hurt. Oh, come on. Nobody gets hurt with pot, right? Those are your words. You said that's all you sold. Derek's been pissed off at you ever since you stopped. No. I needed the money, man. Not you, too. He said he'd pay me triple for it. I didn't want to know what was going to use it for. What did he give her? You don't want to know. No, what did he give her, Aiden? It doesn't matter now, Jack. None of this matters anymore. I stopped Okay? That's why I stopped. You knew this entire time? But you let me keep digging just to protect yourself. I tried to get you to stop. Everyone knew but me, huh? Everyone knew but me. Jack. This is a puzzle. I thought I finished a long time ago. But apparently some questions never really get answered. My hurt and humiliation just lie dormant until the smallest reminder brings all this frustration bubbling back to the surface. It'd be much easier to just walk away and ignore it forever but I can't walk away from my own confusion. I wish I could kill this need for answers. I want to understand what the hell you were thinking. Why did you do what you did? And why did you think hurting me would be okay? And that's why I sit here still writing these little rants hoping someday I'll no longer be consumed by this need to understand. Please make sure you check your citations this time last time every single one of you copied and pasted a website onto the works cited page and I will take off a lot of points for that this time and Roy if you put Perez Hilton on there one more time I'm going to fail you for the course. After the morning announcements. I want you guys to read for 30 minutes and then I want your one page summary. Good morning, Panthers. The lunch menu today is salisbury steak, peas, and mashed potatoes Or tomato soup and salad. Hey drama club, Only three days left to turn in your permission slips for the New York- Expelled, Jack? Even if you could finish this semester someplace else no college is going to touch you. You're just gonna sit there. Not say anything. I don't even think you care man. Hey, John. Hey, Aiden Jack's not seeing anyone right now. What's he doing? I don't know. He's in his room. He won't talk to anybody. He won't come out. You mind if I try? Yeah, come on. Come on, man. Seriously Jack, this is stupid. Shit, Jack. Can I help you? I'm sorry to bother you My name's Chris, I'm Claire's friend. I lent Claire a few of my things and my parents wanted me to try and get them back. Well, come on in, Chris. We're getting ready to eat. You'll have to be quick. Yes ma'am. What exactly is it you lent her, Chris? Um, just some CDs. The Doors and stuff. She kept those buy her bookshelf. Okay. Mom Just a second, Kaylee. Mom, I need help with this question. Can it wait? No. Look at this. Did you find what you were looking for? Yeah. Jack. Hey How are you, Ami? Are you all right? Um, yeah. No. I don't know. Why is this girl? Why her locker? I just needed to figure a few things out and I thought I could find the answers there. Did you? Not yet. No. I don't know what you're doing, but you need to stop. Yeah. I'm really worried about you. This drunk driver. This girl, Claire what you did to Derek and Stacey. They made the video. I know Jack, but you did to them was horrible. Why would you do that? Because because they told you about Nancy Look, I had her backed off I was done with her but then Derek had to come and tell you about her and He didn't tell me. You did. Jack. Ami. Aiden. I just saw Jack. Is he alright? I don't know. I don't think so. He looked really bad. Well did you talk to him? I tried to but he wasn't making any sense and he wouldn't listen to me. He really freaked me out and I'm really, really worried about him. And Derek is following him. Wait following him? In his car. I don't know what he's going to do but it's not going to be good. Amy where are they going? I don't know, it looked like he was headed for the pier. Sorry. Come on, Jack. Come on, come on, come on, come on... God fucking dammit. Hey Jack! You killed her! You killed her! You son of a bitch! You took her from me! Jack, what the hell? You murderer! You killed her, you fucking murderer. You murderer. You killed her, you murderer. Young man, do you think anything you could do will make me feel any worse? What the hell happened? I don't know, man Jack just started attacking that guy. Are you all right? Yeah, fine. Just fine. Are you sure It's all right, no harm done. Are these yours? Yeah. Okay, go ahead and walk home, man. Jack, you all right? Dude, we gotta go, somebody's gonna call the cops. Yeah, just go ahead and get out of here. The hell's wrong with you? Get in the car. This how it's going to be now, Jack? You run around out of your damn mind I run around cleaning up after you? I've been doing you favors for as long as I can remember. And I've been telling you you were out of favors with me for a while now, too. Since you're all out of credit this one's free. I don't know how to make it any clearer than this She's dead. And yes, it's a real tragedy. It is. She was a great person. But no one is worth all this. Look what you've done to yourself for this girl, man. No, you don't understand. I killed her. What the hell are you talking about Jack? She was coming to see me. She was hit right outside the hospital. She was bringing this to me. Jesus Christ. I developed her film, Jack. I shouldn't have. But I did. Fisher lives three blocks past the hospital. Jack you have a guest. I'm, uh I'm going to let him in now. Jack Your dad was afraid to let me in at first. I had to promise I wouldn't cause any problems. These are really good. Derek what do you want? Aiden told me everything. After what happened at the pier I don't know, it changes things a little. If I would have known you had all this going on I never would have sent those photos. I probably shouldn't have sent them anyway. When did you put this in there? A day or two before you broke in. After you got upset about all those photos. Claire, she was just really cool. I treated like shit. And now I got to live with that. Claire, she uh she wrote me this note a while ago. A couple months after I did all that shit. and I laughed at her and I threw it back in her face but I never threw it away. Anyway, I uh I thought you should read it. Take care of yourself, Jack. This letter is more for me than it is for you. Now that I know you're not going to give me the closure I need I'm going to walk away on my own. I've been hung up on what you did for a long time now. Haunted by your cruelty and betrayal. Hey Jack. Hey, thanks for coming. I refuse to believe people are inherently bad and I think one day you'll understand what you did and want to fix it. I just hope for your sake it won't be too late. These are all the copies I have. These are the negatives. I'm writing to let you know that I'm over it. It's finished. It's over. It's done. And I'm okay, Jack. This is weird, Jack. You said it's about Claire. That's the only reason I'm here. This is for you. Cheap bastard You good? We'll see. Thanks for the shitty camera. What'd this cost, fucking two dollars? Four dollars. Four dollars. Nice. And when all is said and done and you're standing there wondering what the hell happened I hope you're able to learn from it and come out a better person. Whenever that day comes I wish you the best. Love Claire
