Greetings, Father. Greetings, dear, greetings. Salma, dear! After God if i've remembered anyone then its you. After your prayers whenever you've remembered... ...your daughter, you've always found her like your shadow. ...I've seen that happening since Salma's childhood. Midwife.. after Salma's mother's death.. ...you've taken care of her since her childhood. The favour you've done by taking care of her as your own.. ...I can never repay you for that. Sire, it's the Almighty who brings you up.. ...we humans are just the means. And as far as favour is concerned.. ... you can repay now. How do i do that? Find a Salam for dear Salma. Because she has reached marriageable age now. Aunt, Salim? What do you mean? Greetings, uncle. - Bless you, dear Shabana. Greetings, aunt. - Bless you, dear. Uncle, aunt is fond of that name Salim. But i asked aunt, what if you don't find Salim Khan for her? And what if you got Sarfaraz Khan, Akbar Khan or Ali Khan? So what, dear? We'll change his name and call him Salim Khan. Aunt, Salma's wedding is my last and first wish. On the day of my daughter's wedding... ... i'll decorate our region with so many lamps that... ... even the stars in the heaven will ask each other... ... what's the occasion? The earth... ... is glimmering like us stars? My daughter Salma's wedding will be so grand... ...that even the neighbouring tribes and their chieftains.. ...won't be able to forget it for years to come. May God fulfill your wish, sire! Sire, someone from tribe has come with a grievance. Send him in. - Yes, sire. Sire, save my daughter, sire! I'll be ruined, I'll be destroyed. Save my daughter! - What happened to her? Sire, the men from Gul Khan's tribe... ... have abducted my daughter. How dare they cast an evil eye upon a girl from tribe? I will gouge out their eyes. Dilawar Khan! Listen, you! Let go of me! Save me! Let go of me! No! Dilawar, Sher Khan wants this girl! Just drop your gun and go back. Or else! Brother Dilawar! Goodbye. Come, Mehboob, let's take her home. Uncle, i have hacked four enemies to death. And i've written justice with their blood on their land. And what about Abdul's daughter Mehjabeen. She is untouched and safe... ... i have taken her to uncle Abdul's place. Bravo, Dilawar! Bravo, my fearless warrior! What are you thinking, Shabana? I am thinking about what i am thinking. What are you thinking? What if Salim who's a product of aunt's imagination... ... comes in your dreams... ... or else if he appears in front of you... ... then how will you express your love? Stop dreaming, Shabana. I just want to know what you will do. Will you feel embarrassed... ... or will you go and embrace him? I won't do anything. I will neither feel embarrassed nor will i embrace him. Then how will you express you love? Will you kiss him on the lips? Shabana! - Wow! Your face suddenly glowed when i talked about kiss. Shabana, i will just... - Dear God! You embraced this pillar as if he really was Salim. What did you say? Wait, i will show you... - No, no, Salma. No, no, where are you going? - No, no, Salma. Oh God, what did i do? Forgive me. I just, i just... Shabana! What are you waiting for? Go and get the water! - Let it be, Salma! You did the right thing. We have to give something in order to get. I had come here to give you this chicken. And i am taking back this stain. Here it is. Brother, this stain won't go away. How can't it go away? Come, i'll clean them. Brother, consider this stain as a gift from Salma. Salma, this is for you. Thank you. I have spoiled his dress because of you. Girls, hurry up now. - Yes, aunt. It's brother Dilawar who likes to eat chilies... ... but it's us who have to powder them. He is quite short tempered by nature. And if he eats chilies, his anger will increase even more. Shabana, please stitch this button. Salma, why don't you do that? ... I'm not good at handling thread and needle. - Alright. Give it to me, i'll do it. Brother, why don't you bring me a nice sister-in-law... ... to fulfil your wishes and commands? Shabana is absolutely right. If one is related then stitching button becomes really a fun. Brother, now even Salma is saying the same thing. Get married now. Yes, don't think to much. Your fate will betray if the right time passes by. Yes, brother, hurry up. Like my friend Shehnaz did. Instant engagement and instant marriage. Yes, tomorrow we're going to go Shehnaz's wedding. And we've to take father's permission for that. Dear, i never allowed you go away from me before this. Then how can i permit you to go out of my area... ... for almost four days or so? Father, i have promised my friend... ... that i'll definitely attend her wedding. Do you want me to break my promise? - No,no. If my daughter has promised... ... then she'll surely fulfill her promise. - Thank you, father. Sire, get used to live without Salma. Daughter never belongs to us. God knows when she'll sit in palanquin... ...and go back to where she belongs. Sire.. ...how will you hide your tears.. ... when you'll put her in a palanquin? Salma? Greetings. - Greetings to you. Salma, who is hiding behind you? Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. Salma, come. You've surprised us, didn't you? - Why? No one could know... ... that you stole Sajjad Khan's heart... ... while stealing glances at him. Well, girls, it's an arrow of love... ... once, it goes, it never comes back. You're bound to fall for someone on the occasions of marriages. You're lucky to have found Sajjad. Pray that even i get some... - Savage. Okay, fine with savage, but at least him. I'll pull his ears and turn him into an angel. Come, come on! The get-together is about to begin. I have written everyone's name. And i've also included Salma and Shabana's name. What's this custom? And why did she write our names? Salma, it's an age old custom here. The bachelor boys and maiden girls'... ... names are written on glass of sweets. Then a boy and a girl's glass are kept together. Then their names are called. Then they come before each other and greet. That's it. So it means even i have to greet someone? Yes, Salma. You know what happened last time? A bachelor old fellow's name was connected to me. I smiled and greeted him. And that mister fainted right on the spot. The get-together begins now. And the first name is Sultan Khan and Ruksaar. Oh gosh. Greetings. - Greetings. Salim Khan.. ... and Salma. Oh dear God! Don't you get scared! Go,go. Congrats. Come on, go. Come on, go. Salma! Come out, please. What happened? I think God has fulfilled aunt's wish. Go and see if it's your prince Salim. No. - Oh come on, he can be an old uncle for God's sake. Go and see him. Salma, come out, please. - You'll have to fulfill this custom. Salma must face Salim. Go. Come on, go. Oh dear God! - I have seen him! Good. Congrats for Salim. - Shut up! I couldn't even dream that your prince will be like this. Aunt's dream is quite beautiful. Will you shut up? Shabana. - Oh dear God. And Gujre Khan. Gujre Khan? Have i heard this name? Is he the same old fellow? Oh God. Is he back again? Last time he went to hospital... ... i think this time he'll go to the graveyard. Greetings! Greetings. Goodbye. What are you thinking, boy? Mehboob, pal, you know that... I can slit an enemy's throat. I can cause bloodshep. But dear, I cant tell Salma that I love her. Boy, tell her about your feelings or.. ... else you'll regret like me. What do you mean? I used to love a camel. But i couldn't dare to tell her. And she got married to my neighbour. And boy, i remained bachelor forever. "It's a nature's miracle!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "I have seen it again!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "It's a nature's miracle!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "I have seen it again!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "My heart salutes her... ... and her name is Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" ?I lost my heart to Salma!? ?It's a nature's miracle!? ?Oh it's wonderful!? ?I have seen it again!? ?Oh it's wonderful!? "Don't walk barefoat they will get soiled." "Don't walk barefoat they will get soiled." "Your legs will feel the pain if you walk on the flower." "Daintiness is your second name." "And my heart salutes to her!" "And her name is Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "It's a nature's miracle!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "I have seen it again!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "I am nature's miracle. I am love, i am worship!" "I am nature's miracle. I am love, i am worship!" "People call my by the name of love." "I'll sacrifice my life for love." "And my heart salutes to her!" "And her name is Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "It's a nature's miracle!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "I have seen it again!" "Oh it's wonderful!" "You entered youth from your childhood... ... and put me in trouble." "You entered youth from your childhood... ... and put me in trouble." "I am in two minds... ... am i part of your life or not?" ?May the love not turn into an accusation.? "My heart salutes to her!" "And her name is Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "I lost my heart to Salma!" "The groam will come with bandwagon." "It will be a beautiful night!" "I'll dance like crazy." Hurry up, even i want to put henna on my hand. Hey, even we want to put henna. - Me too! Me, first. - Look, even aunt isn't here. How can i alone put henna on everyone's hand? Wait for a while. - What if aunt isn't here? I will put on henna. Yes.. If any of you ladies want to put henna.. ... on their hands they can come to me. I won't go. - Oh dear God, i feel shy. So, please come forward. I will put henna. Come to me. At least, anyone of you should come... ... so that i can apply henna. Salim. Show me the hand with henna on it. - No. Why not? I want to see it, show me! Alright. See. - Salim? Everyone thinks ha has put on henna. This henna has brought in Salma's life. Greetings. - May God make your words come true. Amen! Amed! Salma, you held this plate with the henna applied hand. What if it gets apoiled? Oh dear, what if it gets spoiled? Today, it's a sweet that has fallen. I hope you won't fall down yourself... ... or else i'll have to call Salim himself. Greetings. I am right here. Sweets? Salma! Sweets! Oh, this henna is showing nice colours now. Are you awake? - Yes, you've fallen in love but... ... it's me who has lost sleep. Dear, the elder say that if colour of your hanna... ... comes out really good then your would-be hubby... ... must be loving you like a crazy. Let me say something for it. Love is a sweet punishment. It's a beautiful trouble. How's it?! - Shut up. Your poems are absolutely nonsense! They are neither meaningful nor rhyming. No meanings or no rhymes. But you've your Salim, don't you? Shabana, ask Shehnaz in private about him. Like, who is he? And where does he come from? Tomorrow, there is going to be a programme. Drums will be played, songs will be sung. You're going to meet him, so ask him yourself. I am feeling little sleepy now. Okay, good night. " O girls, beat the drums!" "Show us how you dance!" "O girls, beat the drums!" "Show us how you dance!" "Shake your lovely waists... ... and sway your bodies, girls!" "It's time of union when... ... the lover meets his beloved." "It's time of union when... ... the lover meets his beloved." "O girls, beat the drums!" "Show them haw you dance." "O girls, beat the drums!" "Show them haw your dance." "They're too proud of themselves... ... show them the mirrors." "It's time of union when... ... the girls meets her hubby." "It's time uf union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "Your eyes are without kohl... ... maybe you're looking for it." "I am looking for a cloud which... ... will shower water without season." "I like the way you move." "Your charm is killing me." "Call some doctor, girls." "Swow them to doctor, girl." "They are all fired up,girl... ... let's calm them down!" "It's time of unione when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "It's a time of union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "Your hands are adorned with henna." " Whose name does it bear?" "The one who taught me love... ... his name adorns my hand!" "You've been caught, dear... ... it's time you reveal the truth." "Don't get fooled by what they say!" "Show them the out, girls!" "Don't be too cocky!" "Make us yours, o girls!" "It's a time of union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "It's a time of union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "O girls, beat the drums!" "Show them how you dance." "Shake your lovely waists... ... and sway your bodies, girls!" "It's a time of union when... ... the lover meets his beloved." "It's time of union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "It's time of union when... ... the girl meets her hubby." "It's time of union when... ... the lover meets his beloved." Pal, i really enjoyed the wedding. You were quite rocking in that song. - Well, that's fine. But i had asked you some information. What about that? I kind of forgot to ask Salma's address... ... due to this wedding and all. And Salma left last night. She left? Don't you worry, pal. I'll write you a letter as soon as i find her. Okay, then, good bye. - Good bye. Greetings, aunt. - Bless you, dear. So how was your friend's wedding? It was great, aunt. I enjoyed it a lot! So my daughter is here. Greetings, father. - Same to you, dear. Same to you. Salma, without you, this place was thorny ground. I was quite worried about you. Father, take a look. I have come here safe and sound. You're worried quite unnecessarily. No, Salma, no. You're not back safe and sound. My experienced eyes fell me that you've changed somewhat. Changed? What kind of change, father? Look into my eyes carefully. You're changed. Your mind is changed. My mind is changed. - Yes. You've forgotten that whenever you have met me... ... you've always let me kiss your forehead at first. Oh father. Oh dear! - Come, Shabana. I think your love fewer is increasing now. Salma, what's happening to your dear heart? Shabana, every heart beat screams for the beloved's name. Did you tell aunt about all this? I see! So you're hiding something from tour aunt, huh? Aunt, your words came true. Salma met her Salim at the wedding. And he wrote his name on her hand. Salim. Who is he? - Don't know. Don't know. - Where does he stay? Don't know. -I mean he should be staying somewhere.. ...shouldn't he? No idea. "I should send flowers." "Yes, i should send flowers... ... my heart says to me!" "But i don't know where you stay." "I have no idea." "I have no idea. - I should write a letter." ?I should write a letter.. ...my heart says to me!? ?But I don't know where you stay.? "I have no idea." "I have no idea." "You stole a glance at me... ... and then you felt shy." "You stole a glance at me... ... and then you felt shy." "you pressed your drape between your teeth... ... and broke into a lovely smile." "I wish to kiss you... "I wish to kiss you... ... my heart says to me." "But i don't know where you stay." ?I have no idea ? ?I have no idea ? "A wind must flow from your town to mine." "A wind must flow from your town to mine." "Keep penning your thoughts on that gust of wind... ... whatever that your heart goes through." "I feel like flying to you... "I feel like flying to you my heart says to me!" "But i don't know where you stay." "I have no idea." "I have no idea." "I can see your glimpse amidst the henna on my hand, o beloved." "Your love has made true what God has ruled." "O god, bring me my estranged beloved." "I would die without her." "O God, bring me my estranged beloved." "I would die without her." "I'm like a firefly ready to die burning without my beloved." "I feel like giving up life. "Yes, i feel like giving up life... "But i don't know where you stay." "I have no idea." "I have no idea." "I should send flowers." "I should write a letter my heart says to me!" "But i don't know where you stay." "I have no idea. - I have no idea." Salim. Greetings, father. - Bless you. I know that you love this instrument... ... because your mother had gifted this to you. But if she would've been alive then... ... she would have said the same thing... ... that i am about to say, dear. You're grown up now. And tomorrow you'll have to lead this tribe. And a chief should flaunt a gun in his hand... ... rather than a musical instrument. Father... ... brings bloodshed and hatred. But these delicate strings plays the... ... harmony of peace and love. But the times we lifve in is reverberated by... ... gun shots and clinking of swords. And only guns can curb such a situation and not music. Salim, i fear that you might get too last in... ... music and forget about being a chief. Father, i don't wish to rule our... ... tribessmen with guns and swards. But instead i prefer to win their hearts with love. What will you do if enemies of our tribes... ... force you to use guns? If that happened, father, then i can drop this... ... instrument and take guns in my hand for justice. Shabana. Shabana. Come, Salma. - Greetings, aunt. - Bless you. Where is Shabana? - She has gone to our neighbours.. ...will be back in a while. Sit down till then. Shabana, you silly, let me see. Why do you need your eyes? You can see him with your closed eyes too. Yes. That's right. He always resides in my eyes. Come on, let go now. No, first recite some poetry, only then i'll let you see. Alright. Then hear this. May God not bring the day when... ... i won't utter your name. Great! O beloved, it's not possible that... ... my love story won't bear your name. Wow, that was great. Nice. Shabana. - Tell me, dear. Sometimes, i get scared by Dilawar's eyes. His eyes shouldn't get you nervous... ... his eyes are like that since he was a little boy. He rendered me senseless... ... helpless and witless. Wonderful! He rendered me senseless... ... helpless and witless. He gave so many ailments to my dear friend. Oh, you ruined my poetry, didn't you? If you're going to scream like that then... ... father might hear it and i'll be in trouble. Elders are right, aren't they? That love is timid and always scared. But Shabana, i don't know who he is... ... where does he come from and where did he go? Lovers don't go away from heart they wander all over the place... ... to return to where they belong. - When will that day arrive... ... when Salim will appear before my eyes? I fear that he might just be a part of my dreams and poetry. So tell me, what have you written as you miss him? I have poetry, but i can't culminate it. I think i should go to Mr. Shah... ... now only he can help me with it. Tell me, maybe i can help you. Alright, then listen. My beloved took away my life and my soul from me. My beloved took away my life and my soul from me. Yes! And then he kissed Salma while embracing her. You are one hell of a stupid poet. - Is that right? Then go to Mr. Shah. Brilliant. Greetings, Mr. Shah. - Bless you, dear. You've raised new symphony with this instrument. Played a new tune, which was never heard before around here. Yes, Mr. Shah, this tune carries with it... ... love, affection and fondness. It's you who craves for love or it's other way around? - Sir... ... does shore touches the waves or the waves touch the shore. Does shore crave or the waves? I have no idea. - But if you play such a tune... ... then you become like it. Just like olive tree which makes its way through marble. I won't ask you about that olive. Because i know that you'll come to me and tell me that myself. Don't be afraid, dear... ... because the truth is the most... ... powerful and the lie is the weakest... ... thing in this world. Okay, i will leave now. Goodbye Mr. Shah. Goodbye. Greetings, Mr. Shah. Bless you, dear. How are you, Salma? Didn't see you for quite a while. Well, Mr. Shah, i had gone away for a wedding. I can't culminate poetry. I must hear the entire poetry. Come,we'll hear it. - Sure. So, dear, start. - Yes. He rendered me senseless, helpless and witless. The stranger left me with new experience. Wonderful! Wonderful! Okay, go on. He took some, gave some, but he was fair and just. But he was fair and just. He gave life and yet took away one. Wow! Brilliant! Wonderful! Wonderful! What a beautiful line! Next verse. He didn't let me think even for a moment. He didn't let me think even for a moment. But yet left me with an eon to lead sleepless nights. Wonderful! A moment and an eon. Brilliant! That's quite a wonderful thought. Tell me more. My beloved took away my life and my soul from me. Sir, what should be the next line? What's the line? Took away my life... ... my soul from me. - From me. My beloved took away my life and my soul from me. But his fragrance still lingers upon me. Wow! Brilliant! Wonderful! Wonderful! Who is he, Mr. Shah? He is pupil of mine just like you. Meer Salim. Sir... ... please tell her... ... that i didn't say that line. My inanity made me utter it. The poetess is happy... ... that not only because her line is completed... ... but also because her poetry is culminated. Come, dear, come. Oh God. Salim. This is Salma... ... daughter of Chief Aatish Khan. Greetings. And this is Salim... ... son of Chief Gul Khan. Greetings. Ok. Sir... ... let me take your leave. Goodbye. Salma... ... this is the way which leads to your house. Now every path... ... leads me to my Salim. And when I reach there, I know that I belong there.. ...I know it belongs to me. But Salma.. ...you're like a poetry which I can't sing. I wouldn't be here, if I was scared. For your love... ... i can face anything in this world. Salma... ... you are my love... ... but its consequences are nothing but harsh desert... ... where one can't find his destination. In love, if you even take one step... ... you've reached your destination. Your and our tribes are separated by... ... mighty walls of enmity. Power of love... ... can destroy even the walls as mighty as mountains. This desert always craved for love and affection. What if our love.. - No, Salim. We've met to become one forever. I met you and met my life. I've this feeling of reached to finality, Salim. So, can you leave behind your people, your tribe... ... and your world for me? You're a world to me. I can leave everything even for a presence of your shadow. Aunt! Aunt! What's the matter? My dear girl looks so happy. Yes, aunt, i am really happy. But Salma, dear... ... today your happiness looks quite strange to me. Aunt, today my dreams have come true, my poetry... I have become complete. I have found my Salim, aunt. Have you found him? - Yes. But who is he? Son of Chief Gul Khan. Son of Chief Gul Khan? Salim? Aunt. What's the matter, aunt? You look worried and confused. Sire... ... we have a daughter who has reached... ... marriageable age, so i'm bound to get worried. I was thinking about Salma's life. No, aunt... I won't even let Salma think about her life now. I will decide who is going to be her husband. Yes, yes, sire. Aunt, come, fix a lunch for us. I am starving. Are you hungry? - Yes. - Come. Aunt... ... the day Salma has come back from her friend's wedding... ... it seems that you want yo see her getting married. That's right, sire. Salim! Whose name is it? Who is he? Well... Whose name have you written on your palm? Greetings, uncle. Uncle, aunt always says that... ... no matter what Salma's husband... ... will be called but we'll change his name to Salim, right? That's why i wrote Salim's name on her palm as a joke. Aunt... ... i am extremely enraged to see... ... a stranger's name on my daughter's palm. My mind is agonized over questions that seem to tormend me. I will never tolerate a stranger's name... ... connected to my daughter's name. Sire... ... they're ignorant... ... it's a silly mistake. Please start eating. Aunt... ... are you thinking... ... what am i thinking? No, dear, no... ... our thinking can be the same. Why, aunt? - Because... ... you think about feelings... ... and i think about practicality. My age aids me in my thinking... ... and your age is tender and it hampers you. That means... ... you know what am i thinking? Yes, i know. And i also know that... ... what you think is impossible. Why is that impossible? Because your thoughts... ... cannot make our enemy tribe... ... forget about their vendetta of vengeance. Your relation with Salim cannot turn chief Gul Khan... ... and chief Aatish Khan's enmity into friendship. Your love cannot turn hatred of tribes into love. But, aunt... ... how do you know what am i thinking? Dear.. I hadn't given birth to you.. ...but I fed and brought you up. I am not your mother.. ...but I am like your mother. And every mother.. ... knows what her baby is... ... talking and she understand them too. But Salma, dear... ... last few days, you've started scaring me. But why are you getting scared of me, aunt? I think of you as my daughter. And every mother... ... wants her daughter to be happy. ... and alive. No matter what you think, aunt... ... but you'll see... ... for sure that... ... what i think will definitely happen. I am really getting scared of Salma, Mr. Shah. Because she loves Salim? Chief Aatish Khan... ... and Dilawar will never approve of this. And they will kill Salma? Shabana, what must be aunt and Mr. Shah talking about in private? It must be about you and Salim. About Salim? "She rendered me... "Senseless... ... helpless and witless" Salma! "She rendered me senseless, helpless and witless." ?That stranger left me with new experience.? "She rendered me... ... senseless... ... helpless and witless." "He took some, gave some, but he was fair and just." "He gave life and yet took away one." "She rendered me senseless helpless... - And witless." "She didn't let me think even for a moment." "He didn't let me think even for a moment." " But yet left me with... - An eon to lead sleepless nights." "She rendered me senseless helpless... - And witless." "My beloved took away my life and my soul from me." ?My beloved took away my life and my soul from me.? ?But her fragrance still lingers upon me.? ?He rendered me senseless helpless and witless.? "That stranger left me with new experience." Salma. Son, Dilawar... ... who is he? He plays the music so well. When i was born, all i heard was gun shots, aunt. This music means nothing to me. Come on, let's go home. Come, Salma. Salim. Mr, Shah. Mr. Shah... I felt as... ... if i witnessed a storm. A storm was indeed here, but it has left. But Salim... ... today your instrument played... ... Salma's poetry through its tunes. - Mr. Shah. You have told me... ... that olive roots make their way into marble. It has happened, Mr. Shah. But i want to know the truth from you. What's the truth? Salma is my truth. And what about Salma? It's same for her. This decision isn't that easy one. I know. This path is strewn with dangers. The olive root can make their way through marble.. ...but it can't pierce the mighty wall of iron. If flower can pierce through diamond... ... then won't our love... ... be able to destroy enmity between two tribes? What you think... ... is quite possible. Go. Tell your father that he should go to... ... chief Aatish Khan to ask Salma's hand in marriage. Yes, Mr. Shah. Come, son. Mother... I want to tell you something. Tell me, dear. Mother... ... every mother who has young son... ... wants to bring daughter-in-law to their home. So have you found one for me? Yes, mother. Tell me, who is she? Just go to uncle's house right away. Alright? So you want to marry Salma? Even i like Salma. - So mother... ... go at once to uncle's house. Alright... Okay. I will go. Salim! Aatish Khan thinks that i've murdered his brother-in-law. And you say that... - But father, I know that you didn't murder him. Will that make any difference? Aatish Khan is my enemy. And my enemy's daughter can't become my daughter-in-law. Lot of blood has been shed between us. Loots of people have died. - But, father... ... think like a father... ... and not a chief. How can i not think like a chief? How can i? I am chef of this tribe. People from Aatish Khan's... ... tribe have spilled blood of my people. How can i forget those elders... ... who lost their lives for this enmity? I cannot betray my fore father who lost their lives! Think about sometime, father. Think about sometime. You are not only a chief... ...but also a father too. This alliance can end the age old enmity. Enmity will turn into friendship. A simple alliance cannot end the age old enmity! A hand dripping with others blood... ... cannot be adorned with henna. Flowers of love can bloom on the bloodied hand. If you take first step... ... from this path of enmity... Salim? - Yes, father. - Tell me something. Do you want to marry that girl just because... ... you want to end this feud? - Father. I won't lie to you... ... because i have never lied to you. I am in love with Salma. And Salma? - She can't live... ... without me, father. - She can't live without you... ... and so can't you? Yes, father. Is she ready to separate from her tribe? Can she leave her father? Yes, father. - And you? I can do anything to get her. Anything. That's what i was afraid of. That's it. That instrument was surely going to play some new tune. Through my music... ... i always think of peace and love, father. I know that... ... you are just like my mother. You hate violence. You don't loath enmity. Your heart cries out when you see murder and bloodshep. Even you want peace... ... and friendship... ... you want love and happiness. You put me in dilemma. Salim, dear. I can think of sharring your happiness. Maybe i could just think... ... about it and could do nothing. Brother, i am here to ask your happiness from you. Sister Zainat... ... our happiness belongs to you. Brother, i am here to ask you something for Dilawar, my son. So it means that Mr. Shah approves of your love? Yes, Mr. Shah asked him to go to his father... ... and asked him to come to my father. Him? What do you mean by him? It's him. Oh i see. You aren't married and yet you... ... stopped calling him by names. No, it's not the case. Okay, then, say, Salim. Don't talk loudly. - No one's going to hear that. They're brothers and sisters, and they're quite busy chitchatting. What are they talking about? No, idea. Mother said she wanted to ask something important to uncle. Sister Zainat... ... who can be dear to me more than Dilawar? And i also know that Dilawar will take good care of Salma. But i need two day's time to declare this. I already know your decision, brother. Now how can i not give you two day's time? Greetings, aunt. - Bless you, dear. What is it, aunt? You're looking quite happy today. Salma, dear, i am here to ask happiness from my brother. One must never refrain from spreading happiness. We should always spread happiness... ... it doubles our own happiness. Did you see, our daughter has grown up now? Greetings, chief. - Same to you. Come, Gul Khan. Come. So what brings you here? There is a reason, chief. I wish that feud between Aatish Khan... ... and us should end. May God forgive me! I have always wished that these two warring... ... tribes should come together. But i haven't found any way till now. Chief... I can show you the way to friendship. What is it? Chief... ... my son Salim and Aatish Khan's daughter... ... are madly in love with each other. If they are wedded... ... then this feud will end. That's great, Gul Khan, brilliant. You opened my eyes! You've thought of such a beautiful way... ... to bring together two tribes. Brilliant! Go, Gul Khan, go right away. Send a message to Aatish Khan and... ... ask for Salma's hand in marriage for Salim. Sire... ... you've strengthened my resolve by approving this alliance. Thank a millions to you. Now i'll take your leave. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I am not getting this. A man who always instigated two tribes... ... today he is trying to be a peacemaker? Rashid, i am doing... ... what chiefs of all the time have done. Now what have they been doing? If these two tribes come together then... It's us who is going to be smacked in the process. May God forgive me! You'll never understand my moves, Rashid. When i trap someone, i make him suffer for all his life. I have sent Gul Khan to Aatish Khan so... ... that their enmity will even become more stronger. Now just wait and watch how it destroys them. Chief, if Aatish Khan agrees to his alliance... ... then his tribe will be happier. It will never happen, Rashid. I know that Aatish Khan never does anything... ... without my permission. And that too in support of Gul Khan? No way! - Father.... Shall i say something? Halaku, silence is good for your health. Uncle, it was me who wanted Salma. How could this Salim interfere between ud? - Idiot... ... i mean, Halaku... ... at first, you lost your heart to Shabnam... ... then Shehnaz... ... and then Shabana. You lost your heart to them and one by one... ... they committed suicide. They are all dead. - Uncle.... I swear by you. I won't let Salma die. I will marry her. How can you put your hand over my heart... ... and take a false oath? What if my heart stops beating? Do you think it's only you who wants Salma? Even i want her too. Mother. What is it? - Mother. Tell me, what is it? You know, what i'm going to ask you! How do i know what you want to ask? Mother, did you go to uncle's house? I did. - What did he say? What will he say? We chitchatted a lot. Mother, look at me and tell what did he say? That's what i wanted to know. Brother told me that... ... he will declare his decision after two days. Mother! Greetings, sire! - Greetings! Greetings. Greetings, chief. - Same to you! Happy to see, you chief Aatish Khan. Happy to see you. Chief, i have come here for you advice... ... as well as for your permission. - Tell me, Aatish Khan... Sire! My sister Zainat has... ... asked my daughter Salma's hand... ... in marriage for her son Dilawar. Dilawar is brave young man. No match can be better than this for Salma. Chief Aatish Khan.... Yes. Isn't that nice? I mean your daughter will remain in your own family. Chief Aatish Khan.... ... go to your sister's place with gifts. Don't be late even for a moment. Start arranging for Salma's wedding as soon as possible.... ... so that i could be.... ... part of that wedding. That's good, chief. I just wished for your permission. Now i would take your leave. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Father. Shall i say something? - Say it. Father, what's going on? You've asked chief Gul to sak Salma's hand in marriage. And you have asked chief Aatish Khan to.... ... marry Salma to Dilawar Khan. Chief, was it an advice or a war declaration? May God forgive me! Chief is always the person who maintains... ... rift between two castes and two tribes. When Gul Khan will go to Aatish Khan... ... with the marriage proposal, by then Aatish Khan... ... must have promised his sister that... ... Salma will be married to Dilawar. Aatish Khan very well knows that Gul Khan... ... has murdered his brother-in-law. He will never agree to this proposal. Congratulation, sister Zainat. - Come, brother. Congratulations. Come on... ... have some sweets. Chief Angara Khan has... ... also approved of Dilawar and Salma's marriage. And his blessings are with us. Uncle. Chief Gul Khan has sent a message. He wants to meet you alone in the graveyard. Gul Khan wants to meet me alone? But i won't let you go alone. He had murdered my father... ... under the excuse of meeting him alone. I'll go to graveyard ith my men. Dilawar. Gul Khan! You've murdered my father! Today i won't let you live! What are you thinking, Dilawar? Nothing special, uncle. Gul Khan. This graveyard and these tombs... ... proclaim about human deaths. What do you want by calling me here? Aatish Khan... ... the reason for the enmity between... ... our tribes is this very land... ... which is slowly turning into a graveyard. Aatish Khan. So many lives have been lost for thia small piece of land. And just see... ... today, this graveyard has... ... out grown its boundaries and spreading like a wild fire. I don't care if its boundaries will touch the sky! But i want to contain the boundaries of this graveyard. There shouldn't be anymore blood feud between us. So i have come with a peace proposal. - Peace? Between our tribes? Gul Khan... ... can there be a peace between fire and gunpowder? Can we ever forget death of our fore fathers... ... which is a gift from your tribes? Gul Khan, as long as the wind blows... ... we'll continue to breathe the fire of our enmity. But Aatish Khan... ... i wish to lay foundation of peace between our tribes... ... that will be topped by a wall of... ... love and affection instead of hatred. There is no solution in the world.. ...which can bring peace and love between our tribes. There is a solution, Aatish Khan. Salma and Salim's love. Our children should get married. Shut up! You cretin! How dare you ask my daughter's hand in marriage? I swear by the Almighty that.. ... if you were't in my area... ... i would have cut off your tongue at first. And then i would have severed your head and... ... buried you right here in this graveyard! Mind your language, Aatish Khan! Maybe you don't know that your daughter Salma... ... loves my son Salim like a crazy. My son Salim is your daughter's greatest wish. He is her dream! If this is true.. ...then I'll crush her dream and destroy her wish! But I will never let her marry your son. Never! How will you kill her love for Salim which.. ...resides in her heart? Gul Khan.. ...daughters are married where her elders tell her to. And i have promised my sister that i'll marry my daughter... ... to her son, Dilawar. And even if i hadn't promised this... I would have never allowed my daughter to marry your son. Father... ... you can't do this. How could you make a decision about... ... my life without asking me? I can't even think about anyone else besides Salim. Shut up! We Pathans never ask... ... our daufhter's wish... ... when we want to marry them. It's her father who decides this. You're trying to shackle my wish with yours. Salma! You can write Salim's name on your palm... ... but can't make him part of your fate. Aunt! Erase the name of our enemy's son from her palm. And if you can't erase it, then cut off her hand! Father, you'll never able to get rid of Salim.. ...from my heart, even if you cut off my hand. How dare you go against your own father?! Go against Chief Aatish Khan! Remember this, you're getting married to.. ...Dilawar on 15th of this month! Aunt. -Yes? I am going to town to shop for the wedding. You must tell Salma... ... that you can't erase the line made on stone... ... you can't join the shattered mirror... ... same way, even my decision can't be changed. Father? - Salim... Aatish Khan has refused for this alliance. He has fixed her marriage with... ... Dilawar who is his sister's son. No, father, no. This can't be. Salma can let go her life, but not Salim. A calamity can befall on the earth... ... but Salma can't get married to Dilawar. This is a lie, father. A lie. - For you everything is a lie! You've gone crazy in her love. Love has made you so blind... ... that now you say that your father is lying too. I feel sorry for the fact that i went there... ... for your love's sake got humiliated in the end. If they have humiliated you, father... ... then i will never forgive them. But i'll never sacrifice my love for the enmity. What will you do? Don't lose your sense in rage and do something... ... by which death will become your destiny. I don't care if i live or die... ... but i won't let Salma become part of somebody else's life. Shabana, the fate has put you... ... into a great test, like me. My test is nothing compared to yours, Salma. Along with me, you're too standing at the... ... juncture where on the one hand you've your brother... ... and on the other hand, you've your friend. If you want then you can leave me... ... and support your brother. I won't feel any anger towards you... I won't complain. But Shabana, dear... ... how can i do without you? - Salma. I can give my life for my happiness. Will you do that, Shabana? Can you cross the boundaries of fear? Can you break the shackles of customs? And it doesn't end here, Shabana... ... one has to separate from himself on the path... ... of friendship as well as from his dear ones. I just know, Salma that you're my friend... ... and i can't betray you. I am proud of our friendship. Shabana... ...can you arrange Salim to meet me just for once? Yes. Shabana... Salim hasn't turned up yet. Did you tell him to come here, didn't you? Don't get worried, he will be here. Oh dear God, how come brother Dilawar showed up here? Come on, let's hide. Dear God, if Salim comes here... ... then it will be a trouble. Oh dear God, what's going to happen now? Why did you venture into our area? I am here to meet Salma. What did you say? Say it again! I am here to meet my Salma. Salim! - No, Salma. I'll erase her existence from... ... your heart and soul so that you won't even utter her name. Dear God! Stop it. I say, stop it! Sir, tell him that... ... Salma is my wife. She is getting married to me 15th of this month. After today... ... even if i see his shadow on our land... ... then i'll bury him right there. Even then... ... you can't take my place in Salma's heart. What did you say? - Dilawar, no! Go back to your own areas. Shabana, Salim has left. What will happen now? Let's wait for a while, maybe he'll come back. Jabbar is ready to die for you, Meer Salim. Meet me on the outskirt of my village at midnight. I will see you there. Thanks. Aunt... ... you can prove your loyalty. You can strangle me, if try to step out the house. No, dear, no. I support your love, dear. Aunt, come with me. How can I do that? Everyone will suspect you, aunt. They won't let you live. Dear, i won't even flinch... ... to sacrifice myself for your happiness. Chief will come back by tomorrow... ... afternoon with your wedding items. And if they don't find me in the mansion... ... everyone will know that you're missing too. Then promise me something. It will be a mother's promise to her daughter. - What? By tomorrow afternoon... ... before father comes... ... you'll declare that i have gone missing. What? - Then no one will blame you. By then we will be out of reach of everybody. Okay, dear. Come. Hide here. Guard. Guard! - Yes, madam? I can hear some voices in the back of our mansion. Why don't you go and check? - Sure. Salma, dear. Forgive me, mother. You call me mother, and yet you apologize to me? May God sanctify your love! Oh darling. "The love!" "The love!" "The love is like henna, that when you crush it." "The love is like henna, that when you crush it." "The world will keep gaping." "The world will keep gaping... ... and it'll become even more vibrant." "It will become even more vibrant. - The love!" "The love is like henna, that if you crush it." "The world will keep gaping." "The world will keep gaping... ... and it'll become even more vibrant." "It will become even more vibrant. - The love!" "The love is like henna, that if you crush it." "Love brings you closer to God." "Love brings you closer to God." "It makes you forget the world." "It will never... "It will never bow down before this mighty world." "It will never bow down." "The love!" "The love is like henna, that if you crush it." "The world will keep gaping... ... it'll become even more vibrant." Come. Greetings. My respects. - Same to you. Come, Salma. - Meer Salim... ...come inside. Aunt! Aunt! See, I've almost bought entire town for Salma's wedding. Call Salma and tell her... ... that i love her more than my life. See, aunt, take a look. These jewellery and clothes mean a father's dream and wish. I'll make her wedding a grand event. Call her. Call Salma. Why are you staring at me? Come on, go on. Call her. Salma is not in the mansion, sire. She is not in the mansion? Then where is she? - I don't know, sire. You don't know? Where did she go? And when did she go? In the morning, i woke up and realized. I searched her everywhere in the mansion. But i couldn't find her. - Did you ask the servants? And the guards? How could i ask them? It's matter of your family prestige. - No! It won't happen. A daughter cannot discard her father's love... ... and disgrace her father like that. Salma, how can you be so ignorant? How can you be so ignorant? Yoy became my own enemy by fraternizing with them? I am going to destroy their world. I'm going to take away their lives... ... who took away my daughter. I'm going to take away their lives! Dilawar! - Uncle! You won't go anywhere, uncle. Just be at home. I am going to fulfill your wish. I am going to destroy our enemies. Sire, there is news that Meer Salim has... ... abducted Chief Aatish Khan's daughter. Salim? How could you do this? Father, Salma and Salim have run away. Good news. Good news. You've given me good news for the first time. Mr. Dilawar, you're here? I want to search your house... ... and you know the reason. I have no idea. Mr. Dilawar, you don't hail from my tribe... ... but still i respect you. This is a poor man's house... ... and not some mansion... ... that you need so many men to search it. My wife is inside. You can search if you want to. But.... Why didn't you ask me... ... whom am i looking for? Didn't i say earlier that i respect you? I don't question people whom we respect. Thank a million to Almighty... ... that you thought of hiding them in the jungle. Or else it would have been a calamity. Almighty is to be thanked for sure. But Ruksaar, hurry up, it's going to be dark now. And i have to go and give them food. - Alright. Come on, close your eyes and think that... ... i have come with the bandwagon. You've adorned like a bride and your friends... ... well, they are teasing us. Huh? Smile now. Come on, smile. Close your eyes and drift off to your dreamland. "I have got." "Yes, i have got henna on my feet." "She has got henna on her feet." "Ask my hubby to wait." "I'll take time to get into palanquin." "She'll take time to get into palanquin." "Ask my hubby to wait." "The groom is eager to meet his bride." "The groom is eager to meet his bride." "Tell her to show herself fast." "Today is our first night." "Today is our first night." "Tell her to show herself fast." "I have got henna on my feet." "Ask my hubby to wait." ?The gardener has gone to garden.? ?She will get the jasmine buds.? ?She will get the jasmine buds.? "Then my friends with their delicate fingers... ... will make garlands of them." "We all will make garlands of them." "It will take time to make the garlands." "It take time to make the garlands." "Ask my hubby to wait." "The groom is eager to meet his bride." "Tell her to show herself fast." "I have got henna on my feet." "Ask my hubby to wait." "I've just lit the lamp... ... it will take a while to make kohl." It will take a while to make kohl." "I haven't worn my jewellery yet... ... i'll take time to go ready." "She'll take time to go get ready." "I've still not worn my anklets." "Yes, she hasn't worn her anklets." "Ask my hubby to wait." "The groom is eager to meet his bride." "Tell her to show herself fast." "I have got henna on my feet." "Ask my hubby to wait." "Mother won't stop crying." "Mother won't stop crying." "I still have to comfort my father." "Even my friends are crying." "I still have to soothe them too." "Adorn the palanquin and keep it ready." "Adorn the palanquin and keep it ready." "It's about time, she will come." "We are waiting for you a while." "We are waiting for you a while." "And now, my beloved is going to come." "Today, i am leaving my father... "Today, i am leaving my father... ... and coming to you, my beloved." "Today, i am leaving my father... ... and coming to you, my beloved." "Today, i am leaving my father... ... and coming to you, my beloved." "Today, i am leaving my father... ... and coming to you, my beloved." "Today, i am leaving my father... ... and coming to you, my beloved." Meer Salim... ... Dilawar dropped by at my place while looking for you two. I saw murderous rage in his eyes. I have come here with lot of difficulty. It'll be better if you go to Mr. Shah's place. No, no... ... we won't put decent man like him in trouble. Brother Jabbar is right. We might secure justice if we take Mr. Shah's refuge. You're lying! I know that you're aware of Salma's where abouts. I don't know anything, chief. You're her secret keeper, and you're hiding her. I have got nothing to hide. Don't you forget that you're my servant! You have instigated the daughter of your master... ... and the chief of the tribe, to elope with a stranger. Do you know the punishment for this? The tribesmen can stone you to death. You are already doing it, sire. I didn't give birth to Salma... ... but i can embrace death for her. You can punish me for Salma's mistake. If your husband hadn't taken.. ...the bullet on his chest to save my life.. ...then I swear by God.. ...I would have strangled you with my bare hands. You've been disloyal to us. - No, sire.. ... i haven't been disloyal to you. Salma was my responsibility given by you. But Salma was also your responsibility given by her mother. If she would have been alive today... ... then nothing would have gone against Salma. Nothing would have gone against Salma, sire. Nothing would have gone against Salma. You know that i didn't marry for the second time for Salma. Because i feared that the step mother... ... won't love her like her own mother. I have spent all my life like a recluse. So can't i expect from her, that for me... ... for her father for the chief of her tribe... ... she should sacrifice her love? Shabana, tell me the truth. Where are they hidden? Didn't you hear me? - I have no idea. You are lying. You would stay with her all the time. You're his secret keeper. You know everything. Shabana, you have seen my love... ... but you haven't seen my anger. If you don't consider me your brother... ... then i won't consider you my sister. - Tell us, Shabana. If you know anything, then tell us. - I've no idea, mother. If i had known anything, i would have told you. She is lying, mother. It shows on her face that she is lying. If you read faces so well... ... then you could have read the truth that was on Salma's face. Shut up, don't be arrogant. How dare you answer back to your elder brother? When i keep quiet, you ask me to talk. When i talk, you ask me to keep quiet? Greetings, Mr. Shah. - Same to you. We would like to come in your refuge, sir. We might get life in your refuge. Come with me. Dilawar, you're here? I'm here to hunt my prey, sir. - This is a pious place... ... and not some hunting ground. I've always come to the place... ... where prey is bound to be found. Dilawar. - My prey's foot steps... ... have led me to your place. - There is no lock on my doors. Every door is open. Dear God! Mr. Shah... ... i respect you a lot. And i want to tell you something. If Salma can't belong to me... ... then she won't belong to anyone else. Uncle, i had been to Mr. Shah's place. I didn't search his place out of respect for him. But i am sure that both of them... ... have taken a refuge with Mr. Shah. Greetings, Mr. Shah. Father. - Same to you. I have a news that my daughter... ... and Gul Khan's son has taken refuge with you. Salim is a culprit! He has committed a grave crime by abducting my daughter! Daughters lose their existence for their fathers.. ...once they cross their limits. And when your own daughter betrays you.. ...then how can I behave like a father? My eyes are raging with hatred, Mr. Shah. I'll destroy those who have dishonoured me. I am going to kill them. If you think that death is a solution for both of them.. ...then they both are inside. But before reaching to them, you'll have to kill me. Okay, Mr. Shah. If you won't let me take a decision... ... then i'll have to turn to senior chief Angara. Don't try to scare me with your blazing eyes, Aatish Khan. Even i am enraged with hatred! Not only blazing eyes boy... ... but pretty soon it will be... ... your son's body which will be blazing. Your son has applied henna on my daughter's hand. And now i will smear your chest with his blood. If you'll fire even one bullet, Aatish Khan... ... millions of bullets will destroy not only your family... ... but also your entire tribe. May God forgive me! This is not a battle ground, fellows... ... but a justice court. Let by gones be by gones. Now i must make a decision like a visionary. Now only bullets can make any decision, sire! Have patience, chief Aatish Khan. Have patience. Greetings, everyone. Same to you. Fellows... ... if guns could make any decisions then... ... there wouldn't have been any humans left in this world. This world would have ended long back. There wouldn't have been courts or judges or... Or else we wouldn't have been here together. Today not guns or swords... ... but the human values will make the decision. You people will do it. Chief Gul Khan, Chief Aatish Khan... ... have a seat. Mr. Shah, have a seat. This matter is about the way in... ... which the new relations were formed or the old... ... this were severed. The elders of tribe have to decide... ... that if they can approve of this way... ... or not. If they approve of it.... ... then elders respect will be destroyed. It will be a disgrace for decency! It will be end to an age old custom and... ... our heads will hang in shame. If we approve of this relation... ... then it will be a bad and a dangerous example. Shame lessness and disobedience will be on rise. No one's honour will remain intact. Any man... ... can abduct anyone's daughter, wife or daughter-in-law! Anyone's fiancee... ... will run away in the dark of the night... ... and get married to him! May God forgive me! She won't even wait for the night. Hostility will rise... ... there will be blood bath and fights. It will be blood shed. Salma and Salim... ... they are culprit in my eyes! And i ask you, my brothers... ... they should be punished in such a way... ... that, it should be become an exemplary! Chief is absolutely right. Salma and Salim should be stoned to death in front of everyone. They should be burried alive in the wall! If we forgive their mistake then our tribes will be destroyed. They should be punished severely, they are culprits. Yes, they are culprits. People... ... Salim and Salma are culprits for sure. Because they are born in family which.... ... consider each other mortal enemy. And i think nature it self is culprit... ... which granted them with geelings and minds.... ... which made them crazy about each other... ... and made them forget their enmity. Because both of them are made for each other. Birds of different kinds don't fly together... ... Salim and Salma have fulfilled... ... the nature's need to stay together. Their love is beyond compare. Love is peace... ... happiness and life. And hatred is war, destruction and death. They have made the mistake to run from their house. But it's not a sin... ... which demands us to stone them to death. That they should be burried alive in the wall. That their love should be destroyed. They could have left their region... ... and gone to some else place. But i... ... i myself have brought them here... ... right before their own tribes. Before their own people, so that rhey will get justice. If we wish to turn this land into heaven.. ...then both of them have planted their love here. If we wanted to end hostilities.. ...then they have already broken up boundaries of enmity.. ...and laid foundation for the peace. If we wish to journey towards the light from the darkness.... ... then they have lightened the first lamp. Instead of uprooting that sapling... ... destroying the foundation... ... and putting off that lamp... ... we should walk on the shining path along with them. Because it's not only their destination... ... but it's our destination too. It's destination that belongs to our coming generation. But remember... ... if you make any wrong decision... ... then it's going to destroy and ruin us. And your one right decision... ... could bring peace, love... ... and harmony to this atmosphere filled with hatred. Today is the time, the heaven... ... the earth and the our coming... ... generations will bear your decision. People... ... the entire tribesman... ... agrees with Mr. Shah's opinion. And we accept Salma and Salim... ... to be wife and husband. Amen! - Amen! I respect the decision taken by our elder members. I command both... ... the chiefs to accept this decision. Chief Aatish Khan. Chief Gul Khan. Now, you both come to my place and meet your children. And break this good news to them. Gul Khan. - Aatish Khan. Salim! Salim! Run! No! No! Yakub! Gustad! Carry off Dilawar from here! Children, congrats to you. The tribesmen have made the decision in your favour. Come out and see, your fathers both... ... Chief Aatish Khan and Chief Gul Khan, are here. Now there is nothing to fear about. Salim! Salma! Come out, children. Salim... ... how come you're wounded? Tell me, children, what's the matter? Why are you so quiet? Your silence will breed a lot of questions. Tell me, what happened? Dilawar shot him, Mr. Shah. - Dilawar? I am going to revenge every drop of blood that my son.. ...has bled with Dilawar. Dilawar has gone against the tribe's decision. I won't forgive him ever. May God forgive me! I command that Dilawar should be shot at sight. Cut his body into pieces... So that everybody realized... ... what consequence one has to face... ... to go against the decision of the tribes. We should thank Almighty for granting long life to Salim. Or else the bullet could have pierced his chest too. Chief Gul Khan... ... tonight itself you should go... ... to Chief Aatish Khan's place with the procession... ... and bring Salma to your home in a palanquin. Chief Aatish Khan... ... take your daughter home. Make her wear the bridal dress... ... so that the decision and the wedding should culminate. "Wonderful!" May God protect you. Who is this murderer? Who is this savage? Who killed these innocents on such a joyous occasion? Who is that brute? - Dilawar! Search for Dilawar! And shoot him if you find him! Go! You're responsible for this happiness! It's God who... - Chief! Chief! There is news, sire... ... that Dilawar Khan has bombed Salim... ... and the wedding procession. No! No! Chief... ... Dilawar once again has tried to kill my son. Gul Khan... ... Dilawar hasn't got guts to bomb a wedding procession. I think Aatish Khan is behind this. Now i am sure... ... that Aatish Khan doesn't want his daughter.... ... to be Salim's bride but instead... ... he wants Dilawar to be his son-in-law. - No, sire. Chief Aatish Khan is a decent man... ... he will never do this. - So do you think i did this? I killed these innocent people? - But chief, i.... Keep quiet, Salim. You're blinded by Salma's love. After today, you must forget Salma. Oh dear God! No! Salma! -Salma! - Father! Salma, open the door! Open the door, Salma! What's the matter? Open the door, Salma! - Salma! -Salma! Open the door, Salma! - Open the door! Open the door, Salma! Open the door, Salma! Salma! Salma! Salma only belongs to Dilawar! Brother, i will never forgive my son Dilawar. Go and shoot him. I forgive you for my son's murder. Dilawar Khan! Hey boy! Mehboob. - Hey boy! Hey boy! Mehboob. Hey boy! Mehboob! There he is! Idiot! You fool! Mehboob, come down! Come down! - I am coming, sir! I am coming! Untie me, Mehboob! Untie me! Untie me, Mehboob! Bravo, Mehboob! Tell me, what's happening with Salma and Salim? Salma is in jeopardy, sir. Come on! - Come on! Wake up. You arrogant! - I must say... ... i like girls who get wet. Because their beauty is revealed when they are wet. Salma... ... shall i say something? Do you know why have i abducted you? That's because at first... ... i would like to first kiss your cheeks. And then your lips. And then i am going ravage you... ... so that people think... ... that Dilawar ravaged and killed you. Fakira! Abdullah! Ali! No, no, dear! Don't kill him for God's sake. He'll support me when i'll become old. - No! He has supported Halaku in his dirty act... ... and for this he only deserves death. - No... No, Meer Dilawar, forgive my son. I will repay, this... Father! Shall i... Goodbye. I want to tell you a secret before i die. What secret? - Your father's murderer... I know that my father's murderer is Gul Khan! - No... ... Meer Dilawar... ...Gul Khan is a... ... righteous man. I've.... ... i've witnessed... ... your father's murder. Aatish Khan and Gul Khan's tribes are... ... getting on friendly terms again. But today i am going to turn that friendship into enmity. But how brother? Now in a while... ... Gul Khan will pass from here. But he doesn't know... ... that Jalal Khan is waiting for him. Gul Khan! Jalal Khan? What is he doing here? Jalal Khan! This is unfortunate. Jalal Khan! Jalal Khan! Jalal Khan! Who was that idiot? Who has shot him? Jalal Khan! - Gul Khan, why did you call me? I did? No, i didn't. I was going to city for some work... ... and i saw you while passing from here. Come, come, i will take you home. - No, no. Goodbye. Jalal Khan! The foundation for enmity has been laid. Gul Khan will be blamed for this murder. May God forgive me! And i'll instigate people saying... ... that Gul Khan has murdered Aatish Khan's brother-in-law. And then... I will become chief of all chiefs... ... and rule all the tribes. Good... bye! Father. Come, Salma, it's a long walk. The world accused you... ... but i didn't believe any of them. But today when i see you with Salma... ... i really doubt my experience.... ... that i was wrong to recognize you. Angel might make wrong deductions, Mr. Shah but not you. What do you mean? - Sir... ... today i want to confess to all the crimes. So call my uncle and Chief Gul Khan here. And wait for my arrival. Salma, come dear. Yes, Mr. Shah. Who killed my son? May God forgive me! I'll massacre everyone! Who is that brute? That savage? Who did this injustice to a father? Who is he? Who caused me this great pain? Who is he? I did! Dilawar Khan has murdered him. I have caused you this pain, because you... ... you have killed my father. May God forgive me! Back off! Listen and see carefully before you die, Dilawar! I have killed your father, and I will keep killing people. I'll keep creating rift between tribes... ... and i'll still be a chief. And the fools like you will die! Angara Khan... ... i won't kill you. It's the chiefs who will decide your fate. Dilawar, forgive me. Dilawar, i say, forgive me! Dilawar! Dilawar! Dilawar, listen to me! Dilawar! Dilawar! Dilawar! I say, stop, Dilawar! Come! Come, you idiot! Look Gul Khan... ... what has Dilawar has done to me? I am the chief of all chiefs, Gul Khan! He took a shot at Salim... ... but God saved him. He went against tribe's decision. And i gave orders to kill Dilawar Khan! This brute has revenged me for the same order! He killed my son Halaku... ... then he killed my brother Rashid Khan. And now he is humiliating me before all of you! Gul Khan... ... finish off this monster! Or else this brute might murder lot of people. Shut your mouth, Angara Khan. Tell me the truth! Who took a shot at my son? Who did it? May God forgive me, Gul Khan. Your son is like a son to me. How can i shoot him? Tell the truth, you idiot! And only the truth! Nothing but the truth! Tell us, who tried to kill Salim? Tell us. Tell us! I did. And who was it? My son, Halaku! Who bombed the wedding procession? I did. Aatish Khan, save me for God's sake. Stop your nephew! He will kill me! Save me, Aatish Khan. Who abducted my daughter? My son Halaku. Who murdered my father? Tell me! - I didn't! - Tell me! Mr. Shah, i am a murderer, a killer and a criminal. I did all this just to retain my powers. Forgive me, sir. Forgive me. Forgive me, for God's sake. Forgive me, for God's sake, sir! Angara Khan... ... you're most unfortunate. Even a decent man like Mr. Shah terned away from you. It means that life has turned away from you. - No... ... no, Dilawar! Dilawar, don't kill me. Dilawar! Dilawar! Dilawar, don't kill me. Forgive me, for God's sake! Dilawar! Forgive me, for God's sake! No, Dilawar! No, no! May God forgive you! Goodbye. Sir... ... there won't be any more bloodshed in our region. Now there'll be only peace and love. Amen. - Amen. "I have got." "Yes, i have got henna on my feet." "She has got henna on her feet." "Ask my hubby to wait."
