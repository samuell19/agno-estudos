Well, I've been walking these soulless streets long enough now to see some broken dreams, but I still got a little faith and a reason to believe. So pack your things and come along for the ride. It's just up the road down the Miracle Mile. We can dance with Lady Luck, and baby, the joker's wild. Yeah, we're going down to where the water is wine. We're gonna cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. Whoa-ho, the top of the world. Now, I'm tired of doing time dying on my feet. And my body is still shaking from this heat. It's the same old story about a brother raking it in. No, you're just fading out. I'll be spinning the wheel and rolling the dice. If I hit it once, I'm gonna let it ride, 'cause there's no use in turning back when honey, the time is right. Well, we're going down to where the water is wine. We're gonna cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're gonna have our moment in time. We're gonna push it right over that line. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. Whoa-ho, the top of the world. Now, my soul shall be rectified the minute I let my true light shine. Well, we're going down to where the water is wine. We're going to cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're gonna have our moment in time. We're gonna push it right over that line. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're going straight-- I know how this works. You're trying to push me out because I'm a little guy-- take my business, my car lot. You can't take my lot. My wife is sick. I need that lot. Mel, if I may, you've had a run of bad luck. And it's terrible. You lost 40 straight hands of blackjack to the casino, Mel. Not to Mr. Atlas. You could shoot Mr. Atlas. Then you could shoot me. You could go downstairs and shoot everybody on the blackjack table. But you'd still own this casino $129,000. Look, I got friends. I got-- I got a lot of juice back home. You know who I am? You're a used car salesman from Idaho. Iowa. And they're barely used cars, not one over seven years old. Mel, with or without me, this casino is coming after its money. You will lose your home, you will lose what's left of your barely used cars, you will lose personally your car barely used. They will take your wife's wedding ring, and she will lose that off her finger. And if this kills both of you, they will take the organs from your body and sell them until the numbers balance. The casino will keep coming after you. Hey, Ray! Get stuff for me, man! Hey, kiss your mother for me, huh? She must have got held up, huh? Yeah. Women. Maybe she's just busy all day, Ray. A pretty girl like that, hey, they get busy. We'll be seeing you, man. Don't forget to write. We'll be waiting for you! No wonder you hated it here. OK. Mr. Rappoport, Mr. Hernandez, may we never meet again. That's a fine woman, brother. - Hey, Ray! - Yeah? You forgot something. Burn them. Been waiting long? Four years. Sure you want to do this? Four years, Ray. Things change. We have to do this. No, you have to do this. I don't have to do this. I mean, let's just get one thing straight. You're leaving. I'm not leaving. You left when you went to prison. Hey, I didn't know you could read. They're all from his wife. He got all these letters, and none of them are opened. You must have made some special arrangements for somebody somewhere along the way. No. Well-- What? You got insurance? What? Life insurance. You know, what you pay your wife, or unfortunate debts, if something happens to you. Life insurance. Yeah, yeah. Through the VA, I guess. Yeah. OK. Well, this is the time for you to make a very important decision. This is push comes to shove time. Now, are you the man who's going to do whatever it takes to provide for his wife, his family? Well, I was thinking more or less along the lines of a-- a-- a loan payment plan. No, this is the only way, Mel. OK. But I might come back tonight. I understand. We know you'll do the right thing, Mel. And Mel, don't take that gun down into the casino. We frown on that. You know, I-- I remember a time when you would have shot him and make it look like a suicide. I know. I know. I'm gonna go get his signature and send it down to the county. You do that. You be careful, too. We're on the top of the world now. We want to stay there. It's a big payday for us today. Let's get lucky. Stop the car for a minute. Why? Something I gotta do. Couldn't you have done that inside? I guess I could have, but I would have been shot. The law says prison garb till you're off state property. Nice ride. Where's my Lincoln? That heap died on the I-5 during rush hour three and a half years ago. That car was art, baby. Yeah. Well, they still charged me $50 to tow it. So where'd you get this one? Hm? You look great. You know, you could have done this alone with one of those absentee things. Yeah, well, I wanted to end this clean, OK? Face to face, like we started it. A condemned man is entitled to a last meal and a smoke. You're not condemned, Ray. I'm not condemning you. Really? A man's wife picks him up the day he gets out of prison, drives him to Vegas for a divorce-- what do you call that, a reprieve? They're here. - Perfect timing. - Come on, guys. We don't got all night. Let's get moving. Hey, man. You got another smoke? Yeah, I got one. Hey, cowboys. What's up? It's red. You're supposed to be dressed like a security guard. No, man. You said maintenance. No, man. I said a security guard. You said maintenance. I said security guard. This is not part of the plan. Get in here before somebody sees you. What is this, an armored truck convention? Get in here. You and I will talk later. You said maintenance. I said security. This way. Come on. Come on. Come on, hurry up! Do you realize that almost every job we go on, you kill everybody? So? Well, I'm thinking that that jeopardizes us a little more than this. That really hurts me, man. Listen to me, Carl, I am not going one step further here until you promise me that you are not going to kill anybody in here that you do not absolutely have to. Now, promise me. Hey, Carl. Promise him. OK. I promise. I promise. That I will not kill anybody. That I will not-- kill anybody-- That I do not absolutely have to kill. That I do not absolutely have to kill. I love you, man. You know what? I don't care what they say about you. Come on! God, I hit something. Just-- just pull over baby. Just hang on. Just hang on. What is it? Hang on, hang on. What is it? I don't see anything. I don't think you hit anything. Maybe it was a stick or something off the bumper maybe. A piece of tire or something. - No. I must have killed something, I'm sure. You didn't hit anything, Rebecca. I'm sure I must have killed something. There's nothing there. I don't see anything. It's nothing, baby. Why couldn't you just have kept your mouth shut, huh? Come on, come on, come on. We've been down this already. Come on. Lots of cops have taken money and lived with it, Ray. Rebecca, we're not talking about parking meter kickbacks or pinball machines, baby. Come on. I'm just so tired. I'm tired of believing somebody is going to be there for me. I'm tired of not being able to trust anybody. I'm just-- I didn't hear from you for four years, Ray. I know. I know. No! I'm not the same person. That hug and that rocking thing you do is not going to make it anymore. You got a guy? Right. Want me to drive? No, I'm fine. Wow, wow, wow! Looked like the Plaza Hotel. Man, we had a lot of fun in that place, didn't we? I don't remember. Do you have a place to stay after we do this? Just drop me at a hotel. I'll be fine. Which one? Doesn't matter. I got $51. Any one will do. $51 in Vegas on a peak weekend? You've been in jail too long. Uh, don't go anywhere. I'm just going to run into the casino and get some cash. I'll be right back out. There's something you gotta know, baby, something I gotta tell you. I don't have time right now. How'd you like to be that pole up in the Cowboy Cabaret, huh? Oh, you said it. You better check that connection. Not while she's on. Yeah. Tell me that ain't a knockout. Yeah. That's ain't a knockout. That is a knockout. Sorry, you gotta get out. I can't take you with me, pal. We're not going to be long. She's just using the cash machine inside. Look, either I park it, or you park it out on the street. It'll only be a minute, man. It goes or you go. Listen, I'm not allowed in here. See, it's a gaming house and-- Whatever you're going to tell me, I've heard it. I lost my license when I was in prison. Oh, no shit. Yeah. That's funny. It never stopped me. - Oh, really? - Yeah. I used to steal cars. Now I park them. So what's it going to be, pal? Come on, I'm working alone here. I feel for you. Keep it close, huh? Here. Take this. You won't get your car without it. It was 30,000 verified. Hey, guys. Hey, ma'am. Hey, Rebecca. Here you go. All that's going to the vault. Atlas. Hi. You called? Where were you? Just taking a nap. A nap? How about dinner? If you give me an hour to bathe. Right. You OK? Why? Well, I mean, every time I call you, you say you're taking a fucking nap. Don't start with me, Charlie. All right. All right. All right. You know how I worry about you, pussy cat. I'll see you in an hour. Yeah. This cash voucher sounds... It's a $15,000 buy-in. Come on, baby! Come on! Hey, Money. What's up, Joe? How's the kid's football team doing? Oh, the kid's team is good. My kid's on the bench. You guys new? - Yes. - No. - No. - Yes. No, uh-- uh-- actually, he's new on the round. - I'm new on the round. - And he's new-- - First day. - In the building. - In the building. He's new in the building. - His first day. He's new on the round. They're both new in different jobs. Actually, we're here to rob the place. We're gonna rob the place! Come on, Henry. Go! It's me, Joe. Open up. Hey! What is that? Atlas. Yeah, Charlie. I'm in Ridgefield's room. Yeah? Well, did you get his signature? Yeah, right after he left your office. So why are you there? I'm waiting for the cops. Oh, fuck. No, that's where we need, huh? The fucking cops. Great smoke bomb. How was I supposed to know it was a dud? I thought we weren't supposed to kill anybody. We weren't. I made a promise. Yeah, but you made the promise. I didn't promise shit. - Come on. Let's go. - Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Who's supposed to say let's go? You are? Yeah. You know why? Because you're the boss? Exceptional intellect. Open the door. Baby! Gentlemen? Hey. Hey! This ain't a football field, you know? Oy, oy, oy. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I, uh-- Yeah, well, sorry don't walk a dog. I'm sorry. Let me give you a hand here. Give me your cup. I'll help you. Hey, are you somebody? Well, my mother likes to think so. Well, you know, there's only two kinds of guys that wear suits in Vegas-- that's high rollers and pit bosses. Oh, yeah? Well, the pit boss, he'd be staring at my tips. And a high roller, he'd be staring at my tits. I'm looking right at you, and I just can't tell what you're staring at. Well, honey, where I just been, you get in a lot of trouble for staring. What's your name? Ginger. Ginger. Ginger, do me a favor, will you? I'm not allowed to gamble. As a matter of fact, I'm not even supposed to be in this place. And I just wondered if you'd just walk up to these here two, 20s, very lucky they are, put them in this machine, pull that lever, I'll split whatever I win with you 50-50. What do you say? I'm not supposed to be playing that either. Come on. You're my lucky star. Just walk up, put the two 20s in, pull the lever, we win, you get half. Oh, what the hell? Come on, Mac. You sleeping again? Come on, Mac. Wake up, buddy. Hey! Holy shit. Hey, open up in there. I think Louis' had a heart attack. - Shit. - It's all right. It's all right. Just a little improvisation, OK? - Shit. Fred'll get it. Come on in. Oh, yeah. Sure. Oh, yeah. That's your fault. Hey. Our turn. - Cross your fingers. - All righty. Take it slow. Slow and easy. OK. Come on, daddy-o. Do it now. Do it now. Do it seven. Shit. Well, you got another turn. You got the touch. This is so exciting. You were supposed to be waiting in the car, Ray. Well, your car is not much bigger than my cell. And by the way, how long does it take you to a cash machine? - I'll take that. - Wait a minute. Hang on a second. Well, I've got your cash now, so let's get on with it. You get on with it. I'm busy. Hang on a second. Do the-- Don't do this, Ray. You promised me. In and out, no scenes. Well, I've changed my mind, and now I'm in the middle of something, and I gotta-- - And I gotta go. - Hang on one second. - You know what? I'm leaving. I'll just let the lawyers take care of it. - And I've got to go. - Wait a minute. What is the bug up your ass about trying to get rid of me? Hang on a second. Take it easy. - Excuse me. Have we got a little problem here? I've got no problem. I'm in the middle of a conversation here, a private conversation. Do you mind? Why don't you take your personal problems or domestic problems, whatever they are, outside the hotel? Why don't you take that pistol and put it where you can really have fun, pal? I'm talking to my wife here. Why don't you just come on over here with me, pal? Hey! Pull the machine, baby. Pull the lever on the machine. What? Oh, my god. Ray? Ray, the jackpot. Oh, my god. Hey, that should have been my jackpot. You hit the big jackpot, Ray. Holy shit. Here. Call housekeeping and tell them I told them to send you home. OK, gracias. Take these chips, cash them out. I don't want you spending them, all right? No gambling. Si, se or. Yeah, Brenda give me a key. Rome, Spain, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong before the commies really screwed up. - Ray? Lamborghini. Remember what you were asking me earlier? Yellow. Fly yellow. Whether I had a guy. Mm, I love a woman right out of a bathtub. Ah, congratulations on $400,000. Ooh. 450. Oh, yeah? Have you two met? Excuse me. Damn. Now, this one used a gun. Well, why didn't he just jump like everybody else? Hm, you guys must have finally locked down the windows in here, huh? Yeah. Say, did Atlas ever get the roof of his car fixed? Uh, no. That-- that wasn't why they locked them down. Last joker took the plunge just missed a broad. Killed her dog. Yeah, I heard about that. Isn't she suing you? Yeah, 100 grand. Jesus, 100 grand. What kind of a dog is worth 100 G's? You know, it was hard to tell. It was a small dog. All is well. Get the truck started. They're on their way, boys. Let's go. Open it up. Go, go, go, go. You know, Ray, the high rollers, movie stars, sports figures-- they're the perks in this business. You know who the backbone is? Tell me. It's the little guy. They keep flocking to me. They keep flocking to me. With that pull on that nickel slot, that keno card over breakfast. They keep coming to, uh-- to where the Jesus of luck may tap them on the shoulder and say, you're the one. You're chosen. Your fate has changed. You're standing on top of the world. Yeah. We're going to drink to you, Ray-- to one of the little guys. I'm grateful. What will you have? Nothing. Pussy cat? Uh-uh. Uh-huh. I didn't catch your last name, Ray. Mercer. Mercer? Mercer? Mercer, how does that ring a bell? Hey, that's your last name, Mercer. Are you guys pulling my leg? You're the brother, huh, that she talks about. No. You're related. Not by blood. She's my wife. Ex-wife. Not yet. He's right, Becky. If you were his ex-wife, you probably wouldn't still be using the name Mercer. Would the two of you like a moment alone? All right. Putting on a little late. Yeah, I'm as slim as ever. Hey, uh, you guys new on this route? I am, yeah. - Yeah, it's his first day. - All right. Hey, Joe, you're getting a little green under the gills. You OK? Yeah. Well, I think this job's starting to get to me. Yeah, OK. All right. Hey, wait a minute. What's this, uh, red stuff I see? Deal with it, Carl. It's blood, stupid. Shit! Oh, this just keeps getting better. Wait. Can't leave this stuff working. I heard when someone jumps out of a window when they hit the concrete, they bounce and then they pop, just like that. We've got a 13 on level two. Yeah, we copy that. We're on our way. Come on, let's go. Great. Excuse us, folks. What the hell's a 13? Suicide's a 12, robbery's a 13. We keep them real close to each other for a reason. Damn. Learn something new every day. Hey, Fipps? What? What's a 13 again? Shit. That's a 13. Get down, man. I'm not getting killed for any 4.50 an hour and all I can eat. Well, it doesn't feel like rubber. Yeah, we'll-- we'll take a couple of snaps. I'm not too wild about photographs. Why don't you just give me the real check, and-- whew-- I'll be right out of your hair. Nah. For 450 large, I need a little boost. Take a couple of pictures, you know, and an interview won't hurt you, Ray. Well, actually, you should make it out to her. She, uh, pulled the handle. Mercer, huh? Rebecca Mercer? What? You gotta take the check. I'm a parolee. I'm not even supposed to be in here. I can't take it. You gotta take it. All right. So, uh, we gotta take these pictures, uh, downstairs. Yeah. After you. Where the hell are you? In a world of shit. This will be painless. We just need a few PR shots. That's all. I'm not big on pictures, Mr. Ajax. Maybe Rebecca would like the photo op. Oh, there you are. Look, we got a problem. What is it? Hey! That's the problem. Go, go, go, go! Come on. What is going on? Well, let's see. It's a casino, and those guys had guns. I assume it's a robbery. But then again, you seem to be the queen of the ball around here. I mean, you know something I don't, pussy cat? You cut me off for four years, Ray. What did you expect? When I moved down here with nothing to be near you, he gave me a job. A job, really? What kind of job? I'm head of accounting, Ray. Accounting? He doesn't support me. But he was there for me when you didn't want to be. Well, I'll tell you someplace else I don't want to be is stuck in this elevator with you. So why don't we just go get the divorce, huh? Now, go downstairs, get the car out of the valet, and I'll meet you down there, huh? Why? What are you going to do? I'll find a service entrance or something. I'm not supposed to be up here. I don't want to get caught up here in any police sweep. Go ahead. Ray, you read all my letters, and you've nothing to say to me? Get my check. Tell the pit bosses to keep the games rolling, but I want the lobby entrances closed until the police get here. - You got it. Don't worry about it. And I want to be told first about any developments. - Done. - In here. In here. Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Here, come on. Come on, come on. In, in, in, in! Quick. Quick. Let's go. Let's move. - Press ahead. - I'm pressin'! I'm pressin'! They're late. Shit. What the fuck is 5-0 doing here? All right, hold it right there. Let me see your hands. Who the hell are you? I know this doesn't look good. Shit. Hey, where you going? Back, back, back, back! Go! No. Try and catch me! Aw, man. This is bad, man. This is bad, Benny. Well, it started off a pretty good day. I got out of jail, won a jackpot-- whoa! I still had my wife. Holy shit. Ho! We're getting out of here! We're getting out of here! Take a left on Main. What the fuck are you doing? I got it. I know what I'm doing. Shut up. Shit! Yeah! Yeah! Aw, shit! Move! Hey! Stop! Come back here. Sorry. Sorry, buddy. Who works here? Ma'am? Anybody? - I do. Hi. Yeah. I like your sweater. Nice sweater. Thank you. I got-- $30. All right, let's move, move, move. Let's go. - Move! Move! Move! Move! De Rosa, sweep the floor of all civilians. Clear those with positive IDs, hold everyone else. Charles Atlas, on the top of the world. Give me a floor plan of this entire complex. Oh, good god, is he confused. Completely be-fucked. Let me help. One, I don't work for you, you work for me. As in the collective us, get it? Because without us, there would be no Vegas, there would be no you. Two, you do not evacuate my hotel, create massive panic, injuries, lawsuits, bad publicity that I'll be shaking off for 10 years. Three, if you ever come in and close down my casino, my gaming floor, ever again, I will ruin your career in this state, and I will hound you in any state you think you can escape to. Now, what was it that you wanted me to do for you? All right, sir. De Rosa, rescind the order. Secure the perimeter. All right. I need some floor plans. Give the man what he wants. Right away. Where's your surveillance room? It's upstairs. But these guys have knocked it out. Do you have any tape at all of them coming in? I'm only one man here. Captain, we got a description on the armored car guy. White male, 5 foot 10 inches tall, 165 pounds, 40 to 45 years old, close cropped hair, dark blue suit, white shirt, no tie. Oh, I saw that man earlier this evening. He was having some kind of beef here on the floor around the same time as the robbery. Could have been a diversion. No, that was just my husband. He-- he had nothing to do with this. He had just won a jackpot. Yeah, around a half a mill. Didn't want his name in the paper, didn't want his picture taken, didn't even want the check in his own name. What was his name? Ray Mercer. Mercer. This is ridiculous. You know he had nothing to do with this. Get this woman to a hard room. Nobody in, nobody out. Ma'am. You'll be safe there. I'll check on you. I'll be in my office if you need me. NCIC, let's get up to date on Mercer. I'm on it. What, somebody kill himself? Must have heard you were coming. Jesus. God damn it! Jesus Christ. Pick it up. - Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. - Go, go! Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Go! Jesus! We got him trapped now. Go that way, Morgan. All right. But don't take any chances. Don't worry. I won't. Hey, do we have health insurance on this job? Here, put these on. All right. Who's radio is this? It's mine. Oh, nice work. But a trail of fucking tacos just might work better. I can't believe those motherfuckers left us. I'm going to kill somebody. Oh, shut up about that, all right? Yeah, we gotta get out of here first. What's that supposed to mean? What? No, what you just said. Look, I was just thinking. Look, Carl, everybody knows me here. I mean, I would just give you guys away. Hey, Fredo, you want to kill somebody? Why don't you kill him? Pissy bastard. Easy. We need this bitch, OK? And nobody is going anywhere, all right? And nobody is killing anybody without asking me first, OK? Dean? Dean? He's in here somewhere. I can feel it. Oh, shit. I think I peed my pants. Carl. Carl. Maybe we scared him off. Oh, god! Maybe not. Maybe not! Look, may-- may-- maybe we should split up. Joe, old pal, you're in this for the whole ride. You're the only one who knows this place. You know this joint thoroughly. And you're going to get us out, ain't you, old pal? Yeah, sure. I'm getting the hell out of here. You're not going anywhere. Watch me. Well, OK, OK! Hold it! Hello, up there! Mister bad man! Listen, all we want is out. We quit, honest to god. Don't we? So go. What's stopping you? You don't have to tell me twice. Secure that area over there. Got it. Yes, sir. Wilson, check in the corridor down there. All right. Cops! Fucking cops! Put the money in there. Well, miss, please don't make any attempt to leave this area. Hey, hey. Yes, can I help you, sir? Yeah. Uh, do-- do you know Rebecca Mercer? Do I know you? Yeah, it's me. Remember? Oh, yeah. The jailbird. That's a nice shirt. Where'd you get the lei? Cute. You seen Rebecca Mercer around here anywhere? What do you mean, the boss's girl? Yeah. Let me give you a piece of advice. Stay away from the boss's girl. Thanks. I need my car. Where's my car? I kept it close, like you said. Well, I guess I should feel lucky that it's still here at all, right? Oh, that's very funny. Now, where's your ticket? Well, we got a problem there, see. You got a problem. I don't have one. I don't have the ticket. No ticket, no wheels. Pussy cat. You know he didn't rob you. I thought I knew a lot when I woke up this morning. But you sure surprised me, pussy cat. You know you're the best thing that's ever come along for me. You think I'm going to go and run off with an ex-con, a guy with a two-bit weekly paycheck and some stale jokes? I enjoy my life with you. More than you know. You think I'm going to go and throw all that away? You're just saying that. How about getting me the hell out of here? Hm. Why, you got somewhere to go, pussy cat? There's a lot going on out there. You're better off right here. Where I can keep an eye on you. You know how much I worry about you. OK? Don't stay like that too long. It's bad for my image. Hold it! What the fuck you guys doing here? What does it look like? We're taking care of the linen. All of you? Well, uh, John's in laundry, and Mike here, he's in starch. And Howard, he fluffs, and I fold. And then we all stay with it to make sure it gets where it's going. It's a union... Get the hell out of here. Damn. Hold it! Linen, my ass. Fluff this! I give up! I didn't kill anybody. You gotta believe me. They forced me into it. They put a gun to my head. Honest to god, you gotta believe me. Either you shoot him, or I will, cop. Fuck you, Carl! Rebecca! Ray! Ray! Get out of there! No! I guess this is a bad time to ask for my check. OK. Here's what we got. Our boy is Raymond Lawrence Mercer, one of our own until five years ago, when he quit the force and moved to California. Extradited back to Nevada. Convicted on titles 18 and 21, conspiracy to traffic control substances and money laundering. For those of us who speak English? Well, his own lieutenant was shaking down a cocaine ring. Mercer blew the whistle on him, maybe wanted a bigger cut. Wrong. Ray knew there was a slush fund. When he found out it was dope, he brought it down. Not too far down, because the lieutenant got life, Mercer got four years, and everybody else walked. That's because the Feds wanted the whole department, and Ray wouldn't testify. Or maybe the police were just better at keeping his mouth shut. It seems Ray's first year in the joint, some very dangerous people started making very serious threats against his family. They ever come after you? I know these people. Why didn't they come after you? When Ray went away, I guess something gave him the idea I wasn't important anymore. You think you can steal from me? From me? Do you have any idea who I am? Yeah, the Jesus Christ of craps. Take it easy, sweetheart. Take it easy. Butcher's on his way. What? No, no. Not the "what," the "who." Tony Borgese, the Butcher. That's what they're calling him now. After that thing that happened in New York, that's what they're calling him? I guess. Do you know what I want you to do, Vince, for the rest of the night? I want you to concentrate on good news, good vibes. Charlie, when you asked me to take this job, I told you to lose the guy. You don't lose Borgese. He loses you. Good morning, sir. I'm very unhappy. Yes, sir. I know. Uh-- I hope you had a safe flight. There's Charlie. I'm going to see if your suite's really. Problems? Well, this thing took us by surprise, Tony. Totally by surprise. You call him the Butcher. The Butcher? Not just "Butcher"? The Butcher. --two, three. Up. One, two, three. Up. One, two, three. Up. Come on. Last chance to avoid the death penalty, Mercer. One of those cops you shot out with on the docks just died. All right, all right. You're making me weep. How many men in your crew? There were seven of us. Happy and Dopey came in through the lobby. Sneezy and Sleepy slipped in the back. A little respect, sweetheart. Hey! Get that... Get it! Hey, stop him! He's on! Hold it! Right there, he's... Get in! Don't let him out of here! Jesus! You're gonna kill somebody. Move, move, move, move! Out of the way. Go. Crooked ex-cop. Real garbage. He's the fucking man. Where are they keeping him? Son of a bitch. They're not. Watch it. Watch out! That's your girlfriend. Well, we're not getting along. But I mean-- - Chainsaw, go get him. - You know this place. How the hell do I get out of here? Head for the carnival. Look-- see the stuffed animals? Where's the door? Right. Right, right, right! Shit! We're back. Go! What the hell happened? What's going on? Fire! Get out! One, two, three. Good. Keep going. Don't push. We got people. Hey, hey. Easy! Watch it! Watch it! This is an up staircase. Watch it. Hey, get away. Get away! Hey, is this your husband? Hey, get your hands off me. Look, move it on your own time, OK? - Let's go. - Switch it. Come on. Get-- get out of here. All right. I promised Dean. I promised. Slow. You think you know how to do this slow? One at a time. One at a time! That's it. Shall we? No. Take a rest. There's no booze. Yeah, get me room service, please. You think it's a good time to stop for a snack? Thank you. 1,000 people in the hotel, no room service, running out of booze, one valet guy, the cocktail girl says they're unloading staff. All at the same time as the robbery. Police force lost a lot when they lost you. Uh-huh. What the hell's going on here, Rebecca? Huh? Vice president in charge of accounting? You know what I think? I think that hotel's going under. Hotel's going under, and I do believe your boyfriend is ripping off his own casino. Right? All I want to know is, are you in on it? Uh-huh. Well, were you just going to let me take the bite for it? Or were you eventually going to get around to telling me? Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what exactly? I know why you didn't write, Ray. You do? You should have had faith in me. I could have taken care of myself. Baby, no, you couldn't. Not with those guys. No way. I would rather they had come after me than to think that you-- that you didn't want me anymore. I always wanted you, baby. I always wanted you. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm afraid I'm going to have to break this up, Ray, as much as I like to watch. Yeah, I-- I tried to get the cop to bring this Mercer to the office first, but-- It's been handled. You never cease to amaze me. That's got you a little uncomfortable, doesn't it? What? The name. I mean, I can tell by the way you can't say it. No, no, no. It's just that-- um, I mean, it doesn't sit well with me in a sentence. The Butcher. What separates you from an animal? Are you still talking to me? Yes, I am. No offense. But what, beside a bigger brain and deodorant, separates you from an animal? An expensive haircut? No. Well-- Uh, I don't have to hunt for my food. No. What, do you want me to keep guessing here? No, I'm talking pure physical, Charles, the real deal-- all we really are, huh? No souls, no gods, just you. What separates you from an animal? You got me. Nothing. Nothing. It's all life. It's all special. Hm? A human's life is no different from a cow's life is no different from a chicken's life, huh? If I kill a guy, I'm already 100 kills behind the kid who got a job yesterday as a butcher. I'm no better than a butcher. And no worse. Yeah. Now, should we get to the books? Yeah. Yeah. I gotta tell you one thing. There's a big fucking difference between me and a fucking chicken, OK? A big fucking difference. Carl. Carl, where the hell are you, man? Damn. Vince, what about all this-- our profits have tripled every three weeks since the Mercer girl came? What happened to where I was hearing that every week? Right. That-- that was true. Till we had a big keno hit. Since February, we've been hitting big-- uh, taking huge losses on the roulette. We've been losing money. So much of my money is being dragged around the casino? Today, with the current robbery, I'd have to say conservatively, uh-- $12 million. Atlas. It's your mother. Jesus fucking Christ. Uh-- fire chief again. It's always something. Are you fucking crazy calling me here? Look, I've run out of places to go, OK? You've got to get me out. This is not my problem. You messed up. You don't get out of here, I don't fucking know you. I didn't mess up. I did not do anything wrong, OK? Maybe there are too many guards on tonight, you know? Or maybe-- maybe those morons that you hooked me up with are dumber than they look. But I did nothing wrong, OK? We have a deal. Well, I'm reneging, OK? I mean, if I go down, I'm going to sing like Pavarotti. I'm going to squeal like a stuffed pig. I'm going to tell them everything. I'm going to write a book. I'm going to go on the talk shows. I'm going to make shit up, OK? But I'm not going to go down alone. OK, OK. Fine, fine. You just, uh, keep going up. Head for the roof. I'll send my chopper. Would you excuse me for a second? It's the ladies room, Augustus. I mean, what's she going to do, flush herself out of here? Yeah, all right. So how much was it that got you to cross the line? I borrowed $4,000 from a police fund. And you dimed on it. That's right, I dimed on it. Then the Feds offered you a deal? With a hook in it. You know the bit. Yeah, you wonder why you're up, cop's on trial, make a big splash. Yeah, but it's not my style. You know, 4,000 doesn't sound like a lot. Maybe I should be asking what it is you needed that money so badly for. Don't look at me. All right, let's go. We'll take it from here, detective. Who are you? Bodwin, Stevens, and Lewis. Robbery squad, Southwest Command. We were brought here, special backup for Captain Hefter. Yeah, well, we got bodies on this one too. So why don't we all go to Hefter and sort this out? Suit yourself. Right this way. No, Hefter's this way. Ray. Come on, get in there. You don't have to push. Hold your fire! Everything you do is making me less sure of what you were saying, Ray. Now, get this, Augustus. You and I are going to die here together before I let her go with those guys. So what's it going to be? Give me my gun. That was easy. Well, the part about us dying together threw me a little. Oh, thank god. I was really worried about you. I'm OK. You still got the money? Oh, of course. But are you sure you're OK? I've had this terrible knot in my stomach. You're a little too concerned, aren't you? I mean, Jesus. I'm starting to think you're a little funny. Funny? Funny? How a little funny? Funny. Funny, you know. Funny. I've had this feeling, man, that you're, uh-- What kind of feelings? Not feelings. No, no. Not feelings. A feeling. A feeling. Look, look, look, look-- I've had a really rough day, OK, man? I've had a really rough time tonight. Let's just forget it came up. Where are you? I'm on the roof. Bring that broad down here. Is she OK? Lover boy wants to make sure his fortune cookie is not broken. Atlas. I want my wife, world map. Who's that? It's Mercer. You know damn well who it is, and I know you're ripping off your own joint. So here's the deal. You tell me where she is right now, and then you tell everybody else you made a big mistake about me. You hand over my 450 large, and then she and I walk out the front door. Or I come up there and tell big cheese that you are the turd in his punchbowl, got it? OK, OK. You got a deal. She'll be in the Cowboy Cabaret, the VIP lounge. What deal? You're not gonna believe this. Cowboy Cabaret. What the fuck's that? 10th floor. Let's go. Bring the girl up to the Cowboy Cabaret. What? No, no, no. I set this up. But I mean, he'll-- he'll be there. What the fuck do you need her there for? Yeah, you get Dick and Nick and Mick and Rick. Get on it. What makes me think he's catching on real quick? Pack it up. This is bullshit. I'm calling for some backup. You trying to get me shot? We're in their place. We're going to the Cowboy Cabaret. That's right where they want us. They got my wife, Augustus. We're walking into a trap. Yeah, but I got you. Well, that's true. Ow! Ow! The wiggles are good. Live bait is better than dead. Come on. Meet you later. Nick, get over there. Dick. Now that we're buddies, what did you do with the four G's? You're not going to let that go, are you? Well, I am a cop, Ray. Ginger! Hey, you know, if you wanted to see me again, all you had to do was ask. I hope you're celebrating. Losing my job? I won the Top of the World. - The jackpot? - That's right. Half of it's yours, remember? - You did not. I did too. You're rich, honey. Well, then let's go get it. Hang on. Hang on a second. Hang on a second now. I gotta go collect it. We're looking for the stage to the Cowboy Cabaret. Oh, you must have walked right by it. We just came through there. Is there another way through? No, it's just right through the door. Come on. - Well, wait a minute. What do we do with her? You better get the hell out of here. Hang on. You know, you passed it right by, because it's right over here. Hold up there a second, sweetie. Hey, do I look good for a rich girl? Hold on, Ginger. Just a minute. Because I can tell you, I'm feeling good. Hang on. Raymond. You have no respect for beauty. I think it's time for backup. This is Augustus. I'm calling for backup. Send backup. I'm with Mercer right now. He's clean. We're in the Cowboy Cabaret. In the VIP lounge. I hate to say I told you so. Go! Move, move! Go on, get out of here. Get out of here! Is it bad? Just hang on. I'm all right. I'll be back. Jesus Christ. You scared the crap out of me. Atlas. How did I know there still wouldn't be a chopper up here, huh? Well, I'm not risking that thing picking you up until I'm in it with you. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking about losing my ride. I'm going with you. How's my girl? I don't know. You don't know? - Ho! - He said he didn't know. Charlie! I mean, how fucking rude is that, huh? How fucking rude is that? Oh, boy, Charlie, when was the last time we did this together? Oh, now don't you start getting all sentimental on me. I'm not. I mean, like, this boom. Come on. Come on. Next time give me a warning. Ah! Who the fuck are you? Don't move. Who am I? Who am I? Bet you didn't see that one coming. Yeah. Hey, hey, pussy cat. She's not here. Pussy cat? She's not here. She's not here? Let's get to the fucking roof. Come on. Keep on going. I don't know where we're supposed to go. Captain. December 2, surveillance was down from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. And running the accounting room on that shift-- Rebecca Mercer? Climbing. Aw, Raymond, that's pathetic. You were a cop. There's no way out there. You're chasing the wrong guy, pal. Your boy Ajax owes me money. That is a very serious accusation, Raymond. You have to have some proof. Can't you just take my word for it? I'm afraid I can't do that. This is bad. You could have been with him. Why didn't you shoot him? Well, I promised you I wouldn't. I wasn't talking about our guys. Our guys don't freakin' count. You guys are seriously fucked up. Aw, Raymond. Raymond! Who the hell are those guys? You gotta pay to get off this ride! You have $11 million of my money, Raymond. I want my money, Raymond, huh? There is no such thing as a free ride. I want my money. I want my money, Raymond! I want my money, huh! I want my-- He was driving me crazy. Waiting for me? How did I know you'd see the light? There's a couple of things we need to talk about, Charlie, if this is going to work out. Well, you name it, you big pussy cat. Ajax, let her go! I'm not forcing her to do anything. She's coming with me. One of you guys take care of that joker. Dean! Dean! Come on! Drop your weapon. Hey look, you're not going to die for this. You take a walk. I'm catching a ride. Dean, come on! Shit. You son of a bitches! No! Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! We have company here. - You son of a bitch. - Charlie? Don't, Carl. Sit in the fucking chair, man. Sit. I made a deal with her. - You gotta let her go. - Great. So you made a deal with her, but he doesn't know that. He's trying to kill us. Sit in the fucking chair. What is wrong with you? Sit down! Sit down! Get up there! Hey, man, what the fuck is the matter with you? The chick's with me. - Nah, I don't want her. She wants a divorce. I want my check. What? The check's in her name? Ah. Well, I guess I need her then, too. I hope that when she's not looking you make something happen to him. Maybe he'll fall. I can't control Carl if your husband starts shooting. Hey, baby. Put it down. You're outgunned. Well, maybe not. Something tells me all you goofballs aren't on the same side. What's that supposed to mean? This is lunacy. Count it. What the freak? What? There's a lot of ones in between. There's a lot of ones. Hey, hey, hey! Looks to me like we are 11 million short of 12 here. You double-crossing son of a bitch. Hey, man, are you kidding? Those are all ones? Boy, I don't know anything about this. Listen, would I risk you ratting me out later? There's only one other guy who knew what was going down. - What are you doing? - Where's the money, man? I didn't take the money. What are you pointing a gun at me for, Charlie? After all we been through, you think I'd take the money? Vince. Hey, don't Vince me, Charlie. Maybe you made the switch. Vince! Push comes to shove here. I didn't take the money. And if you think I'm going to kill myself, you're crazy. You're right. When you're right you're right, man. You know why I shot him on the way down? Nobody will ever be able to prove to me that you're unconscious when you hit the ground. And I loved that little cocksucker. Oh, that was the humane thing to do, Roy. That was charming. There goes the guy who ripped us off. Shouldn't you have asked him about where our money is? Bring us to the marina on Lake Mead. Vince has got a house boat down there he didn't think I knew about. When we pick up the money there, I'll be expecting some big apologies here. When I get my money, I'll kiss you between the cheeks. Meanwhile, this guy ain't going anyplace. - Hey, we shoot the engine. - Look, man. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Well, what are you waiting for? Now all we gotta do is crash, right? I can't. You made a deal with him? Between all these guys and the cops, I figured it was your only way out. You should have had a little more faith in me. Yeah, well, you know, that's part of her charm, man. That's why we love her, man. Well, now that the odds have improved, I've changed my mind. What? You could have waited for a better time to tell him that. Hey, you. I'm keeping my word. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? I told you we were going to crash. Don't even think about it! I'm gonna borrow your car! Hey, race you to the marina! Race you to marina! Suck my ones. You motherfucker! Stop. Don't look down. OK. Get in there. Just trust me. I love you. Get in there. Get in, or I'll blow your fucking brains out. All right. OK. We're safe now. We're going down. Didn't I tell you I'd take you to the nicest places? Boy, you can get some fucking odds on this ride, huh? You all right? You're crazy! I've got to know something. Did you have a change of heart, or have you just been using me? I do care about you, Charlie. But I love him. Oh, no. Miss me? Deal's off. Hey! You still hanging around, huh, Ray? I like the view. You know-- you know the problem with being on top of the world, Ray? There's only room for one. You got more problem, Ajax. Hey. He looked heavier. Gee, I wonder where it is. What? What? The $11 million. Atlas didn't have it. Neither did Castor. Why would you want all that money, Ray? It's stolen. I don't want all of it, baby. I just want the $450,000. Maybe the price of a new suit. So where is it, hm? You can tell me. You ripped off Atlas, didn't you, baby? No. No? I took it from the casino before Atlas ripped it off. You did? Mm-hmm. You're cute. So where is it? In my trunk. What trunk? Of my car. The car in valet? That's the only trunk I've got. With that valet guy? Yes. Why? Shit. Let's go. I've been walking these soulless streets long enough now to see some broken dreams. But I've still got a little faith and a reason to believe. So pack your things and come along for the ride. It's just up the road down the Miracle Mile. We can dance with Lady Luck, and baby, the joker's wild. Yeah, we're going down to where the water is wine. We're gonna cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. Whoa-ho, the top of the world. I'm tired of doing time, dying on my feet. And my body's still shaking from this heat. It's the same old story about a brother raking it in. Or you're just fading out. I'll be spinning the wheel and rolling the dice. If I hit it once, I'm gonna let it ride. 'Cause there's no use in turning back when, honey, the time is right. Well, we're going to where the water is wine. We're gonna cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're gonna have our moment in time. We're gonna push it right over that line. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. Whoa-ho, the top of the world. Now, my soul shall be rectified when I let my true light shine. Well, we're going down to where the water is wine. We're gonna cause a little trouble this time. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're gonna have our moment in time. We're gonna push it right over that line. Follow the lights, bright as diamonds and pearls. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're going straight to the top of the world. We're going straight to the top of the world. Whoa-ho, top of the world. Oh, yeah. Top of the world. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna let it ride. All right.
