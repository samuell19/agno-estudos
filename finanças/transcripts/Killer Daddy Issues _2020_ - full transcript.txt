- Morning, guys. - Hey. Radar's all saddled up for you. Thanks. Hey. Hey, baby. You taking Radar out? Sure am. Any chance you could cancel your poker plans tonight? - Maybe. - Mm. I, uh... I checked my vitals this morning, and we might want to turn in early tonight. This is rapidly becoming my favorite time of the month. - Mm, is it, now? - Yeah. Hey, uh, promise me that even after we do make this baby, you'll still come in here and tell me it's time to go to bed. I mean, at least every once in a while. Of course. You know, babies are a lot of work. We're gonna need all the rest that we can get. What? Do you ever worry that it might not happen for us? No. We're both perfectly healthy. The doc said so. It's only been a year. Well, it feels like forever. Trust me, if I'm anything like my dad, we're gonna have a whole gang of little hoodlums around here in no time. All right, good. I can't even imagine what it'd be like to grow up with a gang of kids. I'd kill for just one. Well. At least I got these ones. Huh, Radar? I'm so lucky to have you. Hey. What about me, huh? I'm lucky to have you too. Hello there. Calm down, girl. Sorry. You must be Carrie. You look exactly like your picture. Mom? I thought you weren't back till next week. Well, I thought it was time to come home. And I wanted you to meet Reed. Yeah. I, uh, just married your mom. It's true, five days ago at sea. Yeah. Huh. Uh-huh. Hey, congratulations. That is... that is absolutely fantastic. Come here. You sure found yourself a really good one here. Oh, yup. Well, hey. Uh, wha... what... It sure is one for the books. What'd, you get a little sunstroke out there on the cruise, huh? I know. I'm sure it looks like that. Oh, but I wish you and Carrie had been there. It was amazing. Well, hey, let me be the first to welcome you here to Overlook Ranch. Thank you very much. So glad to have you. - Thank you very much. - Hey, come on. Let me show you around. Come on. After you. Did you think I'd forgotten you, Cindy? I run a little late sometimes, but I'd never do anything to hurt my favorite girl. What's wrong with you? My mom's back. Thought she wasn't due for a week. With a new husband. Get out. Grace got married? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't... I didn't know. I spoke to her every week she was away. She didn't once mention this guy. What's wrong with him? He's, like, really young, like Luke's age. Your mom's husband is the same age as yours? That is... wow. My dad must be spinning in his grave. It's only been two years. Can you spray him down? I have to go talk to her. But don't run the guy off till I get a good look. Sophia, what do I tell you about leaving stuff out like this? My bad. I'm sorry. We have to protect the horses. If one gets as much of a scratch, its entire value will be wiped out. I know. I'll put everything back like I'm supposed to, I promise. Everything in the garment bags needs to be dry cleaned. The rest is regular laundry, but some of it got stained by the sunscreen. Okay, well, what about your husband's? Oh. I'm still getting used to hearing him called that. Best wait for Reed. We probably shouldn't go through his things without permission. Okay, and how about dinner? Do you know what he likes to eat? Oh, yes. No carbs, all vegetables and protein. It's a keto thing. Got it. Actually, why don't you and Sophia eat with us tonight? It'd be good for Reed to get to meet everyone. Yeah, we'd like that. Thank you. Okay, I know. It's a shock. Well, yeah. In my defense, it was all totally spontaneous. Please tell me you didn't just meet this guy. No, of course not. We met months ago, but I didn't want to say anything until I was sure. So you are sure? You know me, Carrie. I have never been reckless, but the second he proposed, I knew it was right. And the ship's captain offered to marry us right there, so we went for it. You just never mentioned wanting to move on from Dad. Well, you've been grieving so much, it didn't... it felt inappropriate to say anything. Trust me, Carrie, Reed's a great guy. - Hey, Mama. - Oh, you look so pretty. If we're eating at the big house, might as well dress the part. - That's right. - You look beautiful too. Thank you, honey. I think I've got almost everything done. Everything looks amazing. Do you need help, or... No, sweetie. Thank you, though. All righty. I'll see you in a bit. - Hello, hello. - Hey. - I love that dress on you. - What, this old thing? Hey, check it out. It's the Valerians' new colt. Wow. - Mm-hmm. - He's spectacular. We're gonna fly to Dallas to bid on him for the Italians. Yeah, but you cannot come with us. - Did I say I wanted to? - Mm. We all know you have a little crush on Maximo. - It's Massimo. - Oh. And he's the one with the crush. Who are you kidding? Uh-huh. Well, if all goes well, we'll train it here, so you'll get to see him more. It'd be good for you to hang out with someone your own age for a change. My late husband was an avid gun collector. Oh, wow, Maria, this looks amazing! Where should I sit? Head of the table, of course. You're the man of the house now. Okay. So Reed, I've been meaning to ask you, what kind of business are you in? - Venture capital. - Huh. Reed got into some early social media sites. What, like Instagram or Facebook? Something like that. Well, surely it either is or it isn't. They're one and the same, actually. My stake is so small, I try not to make much of it. I gather you two buy and sell horses? We do a little more than that. We find and breed champions. My father made the Douglass name legendary. Hasn't been a derby winner in decades that he wasn't a part of. Well, it says a lot that you hold your father in such high esteem. Mm-hmm. I know nothing about horses, I'm afraid, but I do have a lot of business experience if you ever need any help. Why would we need any help? Oh, I didn't mean to imply you did. Of course you didn't, but our Carrie is unbendingly self-reliant. I wish I could say she got it from me, but I can't boil an egg without Maria's help anymore. Speaking of which, I mean, this really is incredible. Thank you so much for pulling it together so fast. - Yeah. - Yes, Maria, thank you so much. - Amazing. - Now, all right, y'all, before you dig in, I just want to say a couple words here. I would love to welcome our little lovebirds, our newlyweds, here to Overlook Manor. Now let's all cheers to Reed... Welcome to the family, buddy... And to Grace. I'm so happy for you. Just congratulations. Cheers. That was a wonderful dinner, Maria. Thank you. Aww, you're welcome, honey. We should send you off on a cruise, Mama. Maybe you could bring me home a rich, hot stepdad. Oh, Sophia. I couldn't travel alone. What would I say to people? Just sit there and look pretty. Let them do the talking, which they seem to like to do. Does he seem a little off to you? I don't know, but I've never seen teeth that white before. I bet you they glow in the dark. Uh-oh. Oh, you scared me. I was hoping for a moment alone. You really shouldn't sneak up on people like that. Yeah, I apologize. Look, it's important that you know my spiritual health is everything to me. - Spiritual health? - Look, I don't... I don't function well around tension, and I'd like us to work on fixing that. All right, look, my mother clearly adores you, but you and I just met, so forgive me if I'm a little slow to roll out the red carpet. That's not what I'm asking, but there's a middle ground, right? And for my part, I'm willing to do whatever it takes as long as you and I treat each other with respect. Well, isn't respect something that you earn? You and Grace are equal partners in the ranch, right? And as her husband, I can't be expected to share my home with someone who thinks I'm... What was it you said? Off? That was rude. I apologize. That's okay. Look, we need to learn to live together, or I'll have to build a second house. And maybe that's the best solution, right? Give us newlyweds some privacy at least. Problem, solution, maybe. You know Dad built this house for my mom, and now he's trying to take her away from it. Or, you know, maybe just, you know, build her a new one. Reed doesn't seem like the kind of guy to live in someone's shadow. Well, that's the problem. We don't know what kind of guy he is. Maybe I should just get the lawyer to do some checking. Yeah, I wouldn't mention that to your mom. You know, she said something so weird the other day. She said that when he proposed, she knew he was exactly what she was looking for. How is that possible? Dad was this huge giant, like you, and Reed is this clean-cut city slicker. Tastes change. You know, people change. No, she was in love with him till the day he died. Now she's married to someone she has no idea about. Well, we fell in love in five minutes. I didn't run no check on you. I did on you. No. Yeah. Dad insisted. I even pulled your SAT scores. Huh. Well, at least I did quite well on those. Mm. You're not just a pretty face. Mm. Didn't we have some pressing baby-making business to attend to here? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Yeah, we did. We do. What's that you're taking? Fertility meds. Doctors think it'll speed things along. - Oh. - You and Dad were married for, like, five years before you had me. Were you trying to get pregnant the whole time? Mm, we weren't so much trying as open to the possibility. I think the key is not to fret about it. Easier said than done. You off to the club today? Yeah. Karen got off early, so I figured I'd hit a few sets with her. Oh, why don't you ask her over for dinner? She can meet Reed. Uh... yeah, I don't know. Oh? Mom, have you considered what people might think? About Reed? What should they think? You know, that you replaced Dad with a boy toy. Okay, I didn't m... I didn't mean it like that, just... How else could you mean it? Grab that saddle over there and copy what I do. Jeez, Superwoman. Blanket. Blanket, good. Coming over for the saddle. Yup. Go for it. It's got some weight to it. Wow, that's impressive, on your first try, huh. Let's go out. We're done. You need... you do need to strap it up. Show me. You know, let me help you with the strapping. It's not so easy as it looks. This is where you do need to pay attention, too. Okay. Pay very close attention. Take this to here. Put it up like that. Make sure it's good and tight. - Good and tight. - Good and tight. - I know how to do that, okay. - Pull this around. Ready to go. - Ooh. - You know what? Why don't I just do it for you? Yeah, get over here with your denim, you sexy girl. Come on. Should I try and make her go faster or... Better walk before you can run. You don't have to babysit me. Gallop off, or whatever it is you do. No, I want to hang with you. And I want to see your moves, girl. Come on. You don't have to go far. Just race on back to the trees. Okay, my moves. 'Kay! Come on. - There you go, girl! - Yah! Whoo-hoo! Help! Carrie! Carrie, she fell. It's really bad. What? Mom? Her neck. She fell. Mom. Wait, wait, don't touch her. Her neck could be broken. Okay. I'm at the Overlook Ranch on Olden Road. My mom just came off her horse. There's a lot of blood. No, I haven't. Please hurry! Oh, my God, is that blood? Is she all right? What happened? She... she was riding up ahead of me and too fast, and then just, like, her saddle, she swiveled, and then her saddle, like, slipped or something. I don't know. - When? - I don't know, like, 10, 15 minutes ago, man. You didn't call 911? I... I don't have my phone. I'm sorry I don't have better news, but we found a bleed on her brain, so we're prepping Ms. Douglass for surgery. It's Mrs. Hayden. We were just married. I see. So who's gonna sign the consent? - I'm her daughter. - And I'm her husband. Do you even know her blood type? Well, hopefully we'll have some better news later. Thank you. Thank you. You know Mom's a world-class rider? She'd never take Master out without double-checking the straps first. Are you implying that I did something? I wouldn't even know how. You know, I haven't seen that thing out of your hand since you got here, yet somehow you leave it behind to go riding? You know Mom's phone was in her pocket? You didn't think to look? Look, I was afraid to touch her, okay? I mean, we're not supposed to, right? In case the spine's damaged. I mean, think about that. Sophia? Honey, please let me in. Just talk to me. For what? You've been lying to me my whole life. Why should I believe you now? They, uh... They operated, but she's... She's unresponsive. What does that mean? Mom's in a coma. Oh, honey. Come here. You come with me. I mean, have you ever known Mom to fall before? No, never. Mm-mm, not once in my life. He's here one day, and boom. I got a look at the saddle straps. They were frayed all the way down. - Leather doesn't fray. - Well, you know, maybe they got wet too often. Could mold do it? Life's so strange. Everything just goes wrong so suddenly. Yeah, we were just sitting here this morning talking about baby names, huh? - Mm-hmm. - You're pregnant? No, no. I'm starting to think I'm not supposed to be. I just wish Dad were here. He always knew what to do. Honey, even your dad couldn't fix all this. Besides, Reed is your mom's husband now, so. Yeah, it's a pretty lousy way to start off a marriage. Thanks for staying up to feed us, Maria. You're always so thoughtful. Well, it's my pleasure. Where's Sophia, by the way? I thought she'd be here with a million questions. She wasn't feeling well. I just gave her something to help her sleep. Mm. Well, I hope she feels better soon. Thank you, honey. Carrie, my dear. Good to see you, Peter. I have everything ready as per your instructions. - Thank you, Peter. - Come on in. I'm afraid I have some bad news. My mom suffered a terrible fall. She's in a coma. Dear God. This happened overseas? No, at the ranch. She got home early with a new husband, in fact. Well, this is a surprise. Look, I'm... I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do? Actually, uh, I was hoping you could get me some more information. This is what I know so far. You're not a fan, I take it. I'm not sure yet. Maybe you can get me some peace of mind. I'll do my best. We may need to hold off on this other matter. No, no, I'm here now. I'd rather get it done. Given the circumstances, I'd rest easier knowing that Maria and Sophia were taken care of. Look, I understand. Your father would be very proud you've been so generous to all of your employees. I don't see them as employees. Maria's given my family so much. She deserves this retirement package, and I want the trust so Sophia has something to fall back on. Indeed. I may need a moment to rule out any legal ramifications, given your mother's circumstance. Are the two even related, though? Well, that's just it. I need to find out. Okay. Thank you. It was good seeing you. Thank you for your time. Any change? Mm, no. She looks like she's very relaxed and just taking a nap, and Reed's doing his best grieving husband act, staging a constant vigil at her bedside. Maybe it's not an act. Well, that's what Luke says. I don't know. Something just doesn't feel right. I mean, you can't really think that he had something to do with the accident? Okay, why would a saddle strap just randomly break? Mom had that saddle for years and never had one problem. If it was an old saddle, maybe it just wore out. Whose side are you on? Yours. But I remember how out of sorts you were when your dad first got diagnosed. In a crisis, we think with our hearts, not our heads. I know that's true. I just... I do feel a bunch of emotions in the back of my throat. I really don't know why they're there, really where they came from. Just... Well, fertility drugs can trip off a blizzard of hormones. No, it's actually been going on before. Like, if I'm being honest, I really haven't been the same since my dad died. - Why didn't you say? - I don't know. I just didn't feel like I had the right. Everyone always jokes about what a perfect life I have, so I just figured I'd have the grace to, you know, take my lumps like a grownup. Pain is pain, sweetie, no matter how easy you have it otherwise. Yeah. I just really hope she doesn't die on me too, you know? I said something unforgivable right before her accident, and those cannot be the last words that she hears from me. Well, I'm an MD, not a neurologist, but people do wake from comas. I've seen it firsthand. Okay. I hope you're right. And I hope I'm wrong about Reed. I really want to be. I mean, what would he even have to gain? They only just got married. I mean, what about money? I thought he was some big-shot venture capitalist. According to him. People lie. Well, I hope this isn't a lie. The DNA results. Can I see? Of course you can. You paid for it. 97% Scandinavian. Like we need an ancestor test to know that. Hey, handsome. - You came. - Well, a man's gotta eat. No cystic fibrosis. No Huntington's, no sickle cell, no genetic disorders whatsoever. Wow. Yeah. It's a big relief. I mean, it was a very thoughtful gift. Thank you. Well, I couldn't bear the thought of someone else dying from something preventable. Hmm. It's amazing to think your dad would still be alive if he'd taken that test. Yours should get here soon. I ordered all four the same day. - Four? - Mm-hmm. You, Karen, Maria, and Sophia. - Was that wise? - What do you mean? Well, Sophia doesn't know who her father is. Won't this dredge all that up for Maria again? Well, maybe it'll help her find him. I know she wants to. Well, no disrespect to Maria, but I don't really believe that she doesn't know who he is. They had to have some kind of contact. Mm-mm, no. Maria met him on vacation. My mom said that she didn't know his last name. Well, maybe the results don't go into all that. No, they do. Um, see here? If Sophia's father or any blood relative is in the database, it'll say so right there. Shoot. I was trying to do something nice for Sophia. I... I don't want to cause any issues for Maria. I'm sorry. Just ask your questions. - Did you love him? - It wasn't like that. It was a mistake. It was... Did he love you? No. But he knew I was his child. Yeah, he did. But he didn't want me. Honey, it was complicated... Seems pretty simple to me, actually. He knew I was his child. He pretended I wasn't, and you let him. I'm not hungry. Honey, no. Yes, Doctor. Thank you so much. We're very grateful for everything you're doing. All right. You have a great day too. Bye. Well? They're gonna do another CT scan tomorrow morning, said I should just come in a little later. Why have you been going in so early? Because Reed is there the entire day. I don't get any time alone with her. Well, just ask him to split his schedule. How do you get a marriage annulled? Is that something that, like, a family member could petition? Maybe I shouldn't go, huh? No, no, no. Work comes first, remember? You go. It's fine. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Yes. Am I a terrible person? You are the sweetest, kindest girl I know. But when it comes to Reed, you just imagine with me in that hospital bed, that you would be out of your mind. I know I sure would be if it were you. - Good morning. - Hey, good morning. You're up early. Dropped Luke at the airport. Uh, we keep that locked. That's a good idea. Are you gonna be at the hospital all day? Uh, why? I just wanted some alone time with my mom. Well, you could be there now, yet here you are drinking coffee. Yeah, I'll take a break and then come back early evening. You know there's actually a hotel right next to the hospital? Save you trekking back and forth every day. Look, you don't wanna go to war with me. Why? You'd lose. If you saw where I came from; how I grew up, honey, you'd understand. This isn't about you. It's about me and how I was forced to grow up. I kn... I know. I know. And I... I tried to do everything that was the best for you, and when I look around, we live in a nice home... This isn't our home. We don't even own this couch. I tried to keep a roof over your head, make sure you got an education. I barely went to high school. Honey, you've already graduated college. My own father disowned me, Mom. I mean, how could he do that? How could you let him? No. Sophia, please, come... All right, I'm with you. Hello. What's the matter, baby? Still not hungry? You haven't had anything to drink either, huh? Hey, stranger. How you feeling? Your mom said you weren't well. I'm fine, but there's something wrong with Cindy. She hasn't touched her food in the last few days, and she's not drinking either. She's probably dehydrated. Oh, yeah, no, she's burning up. Uh, can you go get the... the case for me? You get it. Here, let me do that. No, no, she likes you best. Keep her calm. You ready? There you go, baby. That'll make you feel better. Hello? Echo. Hello? Anybody home? She's cooled off. Should we get her some blankets in case she chills? No, I'll do it. No point of us both staying up. I'm okay to stay with her. No, no, you get some rest. Luke's flight lands at 7:00. If you could come back so I can get to the airport, that would be great. Okay. See you, Cindy. Feel better, okay? Bye, sweetie. Good night. Carrie? Carrie. You slept all night in the barn. - Shoot, what time is it? - It's 7:00. Luke's flight's due any minute. I gotta go. No, honey, no. No, honey, I can go for you. You just stay here with Cindy, okay? Well, at the very least, take my car, okay? - Okay, hon. - Thank you, Maria. What would I do without you? Hello? Hello, is this Ms. Maria Elias? Who's this, please? Peter Dawson, the Douglass family attorney. I was wondering if you could come by my office today. Stop. Stop. Ms. Elias? Is everything all right? No. No. Ms. Elias? No. No. Hello? - Oh, my God. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What happened? - Calm down. Calm down. I just spoke to a witness not 20 minutes ago, said she came around this bend like a bat out of hell. I was supposed to be driving. Someone must have tampered with the car. Tampered with it? Carrie! Ask him! Everything's gone to hell since he showed up. Carrie, I don't know what you're talking about, I swear to God. What happened? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy. Mom! Mama! No, no! No! No! No! No! Mama. You want me to come with you? I don't think she's up yet. All right, well, you just... You tell Sophia that... That we love her and that... she's not alone. You know, I set up a retirement fund for Maria. It wasn't ready yet, so she died not knowing how grateful I was. Hey. She knew, sweetie. She knew. Did you get any sleep? You really should eat something. There anything I can do, anything you need? I need the person who did this to burn in hell. We all do, believe me. You really should eat something, honey. When did they become BFFs? Beats me. You know he took her to the crash site. Well, maybe he was with her at the ranch when the sheriff called. No, no, no. I checked everywhere when the sheriff called. She wasn't there. Should we go over? She'd have asked us if she wanted company. So she'd rather hang out with him? Sophia's been team Reed for a while. She doesn't see him like you do. Why, though? Well, you know how she is. She's always been searching for a father figure. She used to hang around your dad like a shadow. Me too. At least she used to. She's been kind of missing lately. Till Reed came. That's what I mean. What if he's using her? We have to protect her. We'll keep a close eye on her. Don't worry. Vanilla or pomegranate? Chocolate. Close. Thank you. You know, I didn't know your mom well, but I could tell she was... She was really special. She was a fool. Grief knocks you over for a while, but it will pass. It'll never pass. Why are you still here? Well, till death do us part. No one would judge you if you packed your bags and left. You've never been in love, have you? Well, when you have, we'll talk. Babe, what are you looking at? My stepdad. Is that a date or his daughter? Does he have a daughter? Only me, according to Wikipedia. So we might need to change the schedule for Radar and Master. We have three out of six site visits planned, but I'm thinking if we pushed some of those back and pulled a few of the local ones forward, we might be able to avoid leaving town for a little while. Yeah, yeah, be good to stay close to home. All right. - Morning. - Oh, Peter. I thought I'd swing by to see if there was any news on your mom. I'm afraid not. She's still unresponsive. It's tragic, such a beautiful woman. I was actually meaning to call you about Sophia. I'd like it if you could add everything that we allocated to Maria's retirement package to her trust. Well, that's very generous. I can do that. Ah, Mr. Hayden. It's a real pleasure to meet you, sir. Oh. Although I do apologize for the circumstances. Well, thank you, uh, Mister... This is Peter Dawson. He's our family lawyer. Oh. You here on a professional matter? No, no, not exactly, although I would like a word with your mother, but I'm sure we all would. Well, is there something maybe I could help with? No, not exactly, it's a matter of protocol, chain of communication, that type of thing. I'll attend to it, pending outcomes, of course. But I do want to say it was a pleasure to meet you, and I do hope you have some good news soon. Oh, well, thank you. I believe you were gathering some information for me. Yes, indeed. You will be thrilled to know that Grace made an outstanding match for herself. The man is an investment genius, and I mean genius. So he is secure financially. Oh, yes. If I were you, I would play nice with that fellow. You may need him. ♪ I wish you would come back to me ♪ Hey! Don't take it out on me. If I keep this up, I might win. Not a chance. ♪ Those days, they were supposed to be ♪ ♪ The best days of my life Okay, maybe a slight one. ♪ But it pushed me down, it broke me off ♪ Good job. That's the first time you've beaten me in two years? Yeah, since Dad died. Wow, I hadn't realized. I guess seething anger is great for your game. I'm not angry. I'm just baffled. I just wish I could talk to Mom, you know? I have so many questions. - About Reed? - No, about my dad. I just thought they were happy. They seemed perfect together, you know? They were amazing parents for sure. Maybe things weren't as wonderful as I thought. I mean, I know he worshipped the ground she walked on. Maybe... maybe she didn't feel the same. I don't see any problem with her moving on. I mean, your mother is an incredibly beautiful woman. Why wouldn't she remarry? I just wish she did not go on that cruise. I wish she never met Reed. I wish my dad was still alive. You've been trying to get pregnant for over a year, right? Mm. I'm saying this as your friend and as a doctor. Making yourself a ball of stress is not going to help you conceive. Meditate. Do yoga. Do something. Anxiety is corrosive. I know. I know, I know, I know. I guess I just... I can't help it if I'm scared all the time. I know. And then having Reed in my face every day? The lawyer didn't find anything on him? My God, you should have seen him. He acted like a total fanboy. - Oh, God. - No, you would have thought he was meeting Mark Zuckerberg himself. That's why I called you. I had to get out of there. I was like, "Nope." And Reed's still at the hospital right now? He never leaves. You, uh... you mind if we skip lunch? I just thought of something I needed to do. You need help with that? It says here that your name is Lawrence. Well, it is, and my dad's. Two men with the same name in the same house gets confusing, and Mom wasn't about to let them call me Larry. I mean, do I look like a Larry? Should have done this sooner, but given everything that's happened... What is this? A statement of assets. I already know you're rich. This doesn't prove anything. It should rule me out as a gold digger, at least. That's a prenup. I had my lawyers draw it up before I proposed. I love my wife, but Grace is not the only one that needed protecting. It has a clause in there about life insurance. We hadn't gotten around to buying any yet, but even if we had, I'm hardly gonna hurt the woman I've waited my whole life to fall in love with. And I submitted for a full criminal background check this morning. Sheriff will vouch for me. I'm clean. Look, I don't know what else I can do to prove it to you, but I am not the enemy. Well, you've been antagonistic to me since the day I met you. I have? Really? You're joking. You said that this house wasn't big enough for the both of us and that I would lose if I went to war with you. That was just me trying to stand my ground. You're kind of formidable when you're mad, you know? You don't understand. I... I can't bear it, seeing her in that bed, so close and so far away. I don't know what to do anymore. Look. I do understand, okay? It's exactly how I feel. Don't you see? We're both trapped in this same horrible nightmare. It's like torture to go in there every single day, never knowing if she's gonna wake up. What if she doesn't? I... I can't think like that. I have to keep the faith. You're right. We have to keep hoping together. ♪ You may believe ♪ All the good things you've got ♪ ♪ 'Cause life is calling, you'll be the ♪ I heard shots. Luke, help. Yeah, I don't see anything up there. I mean, I saw your footprints, but... You think I imagined it? No. No, come on. Of course not. Uh... All right. Oh, wow, have you been here this whole time? Peter Dawson was just looking for you. - Who? - Our family lawyer? He said that he left you messages. If you're gonna fire me, why don't you just do it yourself? Sophia, honey, I would never fire you, ever. I'm sure he's just messaging you because of Maria. I'm sure she left a will or something. She didn't. How can you be so sure? I've done our accounts since high school. She put every penny into my college fund. There was nothing left to leave. Okay, well, maybe just call the guy back, okay? So you're not trying to evict me? Okay, where is this coming from? I would never evict you. This is your home. We're your family. I never want you to leave, I mean, unless you, like, wanna go somewhere, and then you can come back. But until then, this is where you belong. I hope you know that. I wish you could hear me so you know how sorry I am for what I said. I took so much for granted. I just... I always assumed you were happy. It never crossed my mind that you may want to start your own life. Am I so self-absorbed that you couldn't tell me? Mom? Mom? Oh, my God. Carrie. I'm so relieved. Oh, my God. - How long have I... - Forever, it seemed like. Oh, my God, you can hear me. I can. Are you in any pain? I'm a little dizzy. I was dreaming. There was a baby... giggling. Was it me or Sophia? It was a boy. Maybe it's a premonition. Are you pregnant? No, I wish. Maybe you are. Oh, don't make me laugh. I should go get Reed, okay? He hasn't left the bedside in weeks. Oh, Carrie, wait. I must look terrible. You look beautiful. Oh, stop it. You need both hands. Grace. Oh, my God, Grace. Grace. Oh, my God, you're okay. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God, thank God. I missed you so much. I love you so much. Hey, honey. I'm still at the hospital, but good news. Mom woke up. How much does Grace know? I couldn't bring myself to tell her about Maria yet. She's too fragile. And Reed agrees. Listen to you, conferring with Reed. Well, he is my stepdad. But seriously, I mean, have you seen how attentive he is? The guy doesn't miss a beat. It's romantic. All right, I miss you. I'll be home soon. All right. I'll see you soon, honey. Thank you. - Are you comfortable? - Yeah. You know, as bad as this calamity was, it brought you two together, and that is a miracle in and of itself. Actually, I owe you an apology, Mom, and especially you, Reed. I'm really sorry for everything I put you through. It's shameful. You were so devoted to my mom, and we're both so grateful that she has you in her life. It means a lot to hear you say that. Unbelievable. She made your life a living hell, and you're just gonna blow it off like it was nothing? Whoa, whoa, Sophia, what's gotten into you? And where's your mom? Oh, you... you didn't tell her? Was my mom so insignificant to you that you couldn't even bother to tell her that she died in your car? What? Maria died? There was a terrible accident, and... Maria didn't make it. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Sophia. What do you care? She was your maid. No, she was my friend. Tell yourself that. She can't hear us anyway. I'm sorry. What's the point of knocking if you won't even wait for an answer? Sorry. I saw you were still up, so. What are you looking at? Pictures of Mama. Can I see? I'm taking Radar off to stud for a week tomorrow. Gonna go on an early-morning ride. You wanna come with? Master could use a good run too. Are you asking, or are you telling me? Asking, of course. Then no. How would you feel about maybe moving to the big house? Why would I do that? Well, because I don't like you out here all alone. What, do you think I'm in danger? No, I just think it would, you know, be better if we were all under the same roof. I'll think about it. Okay. I've been shot. Forest behind East Hill. You're lucky, just a flesh wound. Lucky someone shot me? Maybe now you guys will believe me. Well, the rifles are cold. Don't think any of those are our weapon. I'll have my guy do a thorough test though. Well, whoever it is, he's very skilled with a rifle. I was way beyond those trees, and he still made the shot. If it wasn't for Radar, I don't... You'd be dead. I, uh, owe you an apology, Carrie. I spoke too soon about your car. Someone had drained all the brake fluid, amateur job. I knew that someone tampered with it. I need a list of everyone who has access to the ranch. Well, with staff and clients, that's over 20 people on any given day. I'm guessing you don't have security cameras? Daniel never saw the need for them. Well, no disrespect to your late husband, ma'am, but it's time to change that. Why would anyone want to hurt Carrie? And Grace. Don't forget about her. Something on your mind, Sophia? Same as what's on everyone's mind. You know someone who wants to hurt your family? My family? No one wants to hurt my family. Only reason why my mom is dead is because someone's out to get her. You want something? She send you out to check on me? No. No. Maybe. Why'd you let Daniel Douglass treat you like crap all those years? What do you mean? Like the hired help. It's what I was, technically. Why'd you follow him around like a little lamb? I was a kid. I didn't know any better. I used to always hear him griping about you, you know? He didn't think you were good enough for his precious Carrie. Well, maybe I wasn't. You're ten times the person she is. Come on, how long you gonna keep this up? Look, losing your mom is... That's awful, but... you can't keep blaming Carrie. She's as cut up about it as anyone. Why should she be? It was her fault. Or mine, by that logic. The only reason Maria got in that car was to get me from the airport. Mama liked you, you know. And Carrie loves you like a sister. This whole time, she's been focused on how you're feeling and telling us what to do to get you back up on your feet. Nothing to do. Mama's gone, and no one nor nothing can bring her back. I'm sorry, kiddo. Hey, I really need you right now. Hey. Maybe we should look into getting her some grief counseling. Would she go? I don't know. Well, we can't let her isolate. We need to just keep getting in her face, you know, let her know that we're here for her. But you need to take care of you first. You're no help to Sophia if you're hurt or if you're otherwise. Peter Dawson called today, wants Mom and me to stop by, says it's urgent. When does he want to come by? Mom wants to go to him, thinks it'll be nice to get out of the house. That's 'cause she doesn't know what's going on. We need to tell her what danger she's in. Once Reed gets back, all four of us will sit down. How long is he gone for? Another day or two. I guess he let a lot of work slide when Mom was in the hospital. You look so beautiful, Mom. Oh, thank you. Grace, you look fantastic. Oh. I could have come out to the ranch. Oh, I'm happy for any excuse to come to town. Can I get you anything: water, coffee? No, I'm fine, really. You sure? It's no problem. Peter, what's all this about? Last time we all three met in here, it was to go over Daniel's will. What I was not at liberty to disclose at the time was that he provided two addenda. Addenda? Revisions to the will in the event of certain eventualities. Like me getting married. Exactly. I knew it. Did you? No, but I'm not surprised, knowing Daniel. To be specific, the revision only ratified if you married within five years of his passing. Now you're two years, four months since, so... He's cutting me out of the ranch. He has, yes. So it all goes to Carrie. Not exactly. Your share transfers to Ms. Maria Elias. Maria? I attempted to convey this to her on the day of her tragic passing, but... So she didn't know? Sadly, no. That brings us to the second addendum. That provides for the possibility of Ms. Elias's passing. Her share and all inherent assets transfers to her daughter, Sophia. Oh. Now, I attempted to... well, that's why I stalled when you asked me to set up that very generous trust in her name. I invited her to join us here today, but as you can see, she's a no-show. And these matters need to be conveyed in person, so I would appreciate your discretion. So we can't say anything to her? No. I'm attempting to follow protocol here. But things appear to keep changing at the Douglass household. Hayden household. My name is Hayden now. There are no more Douglasses on the ranch. Okay. Would it have made a difference if you'd known? Would I still have married Reed, you mean? Yeah. I doubt he would have waited three years, but I certainly would have asked. Why? He proposed to someone he thought had considerable means. He loves you. Doubt he cares about that stuff. Reed being younger already puts me at a disadvantage, but with everything that's happened and now... sudden poverty, I'm really not sure how he'll react. Well, if I couldn't scare him off, nothing will. I'm surprised at Dad. I never knew him to be petty. There was a lot about your father you didn't know. Tell me. I just... I thought you two were so in love. Oh, we were, for a long time. Something changed. I don't know if it was the success or money or... He got so... insecure, insisted on making decisions about everything. I fought it for a while, but I finally just gave up. It was... kind of demoralizing. I never knew. 'Cause I didn't tell you. I don't think any good mother would. Daniel wanted the world to believe that I was his queen and you were his princess, but in reality we were his subjects. He ruled the roost. He still does. Wow, you got these cameras installed quickly. Yeah, I know. It's impressive, right? We put up 20 cameras and five sensors. - Sensors? - Yeah, it's a... They trip the floodlights if there's any movement or... Well, won't they go off all night with all the little critters running around? Yeah, well, sure, but who cares as long as we get eyes on, you know, whoever's trying to hurt you? Is Sophia out? Uh, yeah, I'm not sure. Haven't seen her today. You're supposed to keep an eye on her. Well, I've been pretty busy here. Uh-oh. Reed's back. "Uh-oh"? I thought you guys were best buds now. My mom got some bad news. She's not looking forward to telling him. Huh. My poor baby. You're not sorry you married me? Are you kidding me? Of course not. Look, I have more than enough for the both of us, okay? Although I hope this means we can spend a little bit more time on the West Coast. If it weren't for you, I doubt I'd ever go near another horse again. Hey, Carrie! What are you so excited about? Well, look at what finally showed up, huh? Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your horses. It's my ancestral heritage we're talking about here. All right, let's see what we got. Oh, look at that. I'm... I'm mostly French. What? I always wanted to be with a French guy. Oh, yeah? Let's see here. We got... nope, no Parkinson's, no Huntington's, and no, no, no, no. There's nothing here. - Oh, that's such a relief. - Nothing. Yeah. Well, you know, I'm pretty good at tests, you know, SATs, ACTs, DNAs. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes, baby, you are. Any sign of Sophia yet? Uh, no, no, I haven't seen her. What is going on? Hey, Sophia, um... we are worried sick about you. We met with the lawyer again today, and he needs to speak to you urgently, so if you can just give me a call as soon as you get this? Okay, bye. Just give me a call as soon as you get this? Okay, bye. It's never locked. You think she ran away? I don't know. Can you call it that if it's a grown woman? You want me to break the window? Maybe it'd be good to know if she's taken her stuff. No, there's a spare key somewhere. I think I know where. I'm gonna call the sheriff, though, before it gets too late, okay? All right. I'll be right there. All right. Does she have a boyfriend? Uh, not that I know of. I mean, she has an Italian boy that she video chats with sometimes, but she only sees him when the family has business here. Well, can't hurt to contact him, see if he's heard from her. Okay. What year is the SUV? Uh, 2014 or '15, I think. Yeah. Does it have a tracking system? Uh, I can find out. I know where he keeps the paperwork upstairs. Okay. Well, call me when you do. I, uh... I doubt she's gone far, but you're right to let me know. That young lady's been through a lot already. Probably not thinking straight right now. Well, we know all of her favorite places. We could just drive around if that would help... Please, Carrie, we've already had two attempts on your life. I need you safe, here, indoors, preferably, with Luke close by. I'll check back as soon as I know something. Thank you. Thank you for coming out. Thank you. Hey! Hey, Carrie. Hey, look Daniel had a tracking system installed when he bought the SUV. I'll just take a picture of this code, and I'll forward it over to the sheriff. Massimo hasn't heard from her either. Yeah, well, I figured as much. She's hardly gonna run off to Italy for a boy she hardly knows. Well, what about one of her college friends? But why wouldn't she tell us? As soon as they ping this GPS, we'll know where she is, and we can go get her then. Oh, found the keys to the guest house. Hey. I saw the sheriff was here. Everything all right? Sophia went AWOL. She won't answer her phone. It's going straight to voicemail. Yeah, I mean, maybe she just forgot her charger. There's one in her car. Maria gave us all one for Christmas. Welcome home, by the way. We missed you. Hey, where the hell have you been? We've been looking all over for you. Why? Well, we were worried. About what? About you doing something stupid; you hurting yourself or something. Hurting myself? You're one dumb cowboy. All right, Sophia. It's after midnight. Let us hear. Quit playing around. Where is she? Why do you love her so much? What kind of question is that? You just get on home, now. Come on. I can't. Some idiot ran me off the highway. I'm bail-deep in mud. Where? State line, about a mile out of Route 40. All right, I'll come get you. Better bring Reed... and a shovel. All right, you mind coming along? Yeah, yeah, let's go. Whatever you need. Well, at least we know she's safe, but what was she doing all the way out at the state line? No idea. I mean, Reed's had a long enough day as it is. How'd he take the news? You were right. He doesn't care that I'm poor. Well, I was wrong about him for a long time. I can't believe all the crap I put that poor man through. Well, I'm gonna get out of here, let you get some sleep. No point in all of us waiting up. What is it? Nothing, Mom. Get some rest, okay? Good night, Mom. Okay. Night. Sophia? Sophia? Hello? We got a hit on Sophia's car. Yeah, we know. She's out near junction 40 near the state line. No, she's at the ranch. Are you... are you sure? 100%. That's not all. We ran Sophia's license in the system. Sophia bought a shotgun in Allegheny County two days before Carrie got shot. Amazing, huh? The great Daniel James Douglass was my dad too, except he didn't want anyone to know so you two parasites could live like royalty. I'm sorry for a lot of things, but I won't be sorry for this. You really think hiding behind your precious champions will stop me? Don't move. Do it. I dare you. Why, Sophia? Tell her. I cut the strap on Master's saddle, prayed you would die. What? Did you also cut the brakes to my car? Get up. Dad was her father also. Daniel? That can't be. Don't pretend like you didn't know. I didn't, I swear. Go call Sheriff Jackson. No. I don't want to leave you alone. I'll be fine. You silly girl. He tried to make it right, you know. You're a liar. Why do you think the lawyer was calling? He would have left half the ranch to Maria, but you killed her. No! Sophia! Get up! Get off her! Stay there. I need you to come down and give a full statement. What happens to her now? Nothing good. You still thinking about Sophia? Actually, I was thinking about my dad, you know, how anyone could deny their own child like that. Guess he thought he had too much to lose. I worshipped that man. Of course. You know, he tried to talk me out of marrying you? Yeah, he wasn't shy about telling me, neither. And to think I tried to do the exact same thing to Mom and Reed. I feel so ashamed. Did what he taught you to. Gotta be honest, I'm kinda glad old Daniel's been knocked off his pedestal a little bit. It hasn't been easy living in that man's shadow. Yeah, that was on me. No. A father's influence shapes a girl's expectations of the world, you know? It sets the standard for who she'll give her heart to. I mean, you think Sophia would have done any of this if Daniel had shown her love or claimed her as his child? I really hope that we have a little girl so she gets to have you for a dad. You and me both. Of course, this could be a boy. Guess we'll find out soon enough. Are you pregnant? Yes, I am.
