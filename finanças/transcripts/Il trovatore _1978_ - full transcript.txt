Now we're dicing, but ere long we'll play a quite different game; this sword, now wiped clean of blood, will soon be bathed in blood again! The reinforcements asked for! They look brave enough! May the attack on Castellor no longer be put off. no longer be put off. Yes, brave friends, at dawn the captain plans to attack the fort on every side. There rich booty we'll surely find, beyond our hopes. Conquer then, and it's ours. You're inviting us to a party. Let the warlike trumpet sound and echo, call to arms, to the fray, the attack; may our flag be planted tomorrow on the highest of those towers. No, victory has never smiled on happier hopes than ours! There glory awaits us - and the needful. There wait spoil, booty and honour. Let the warlike trumpet, etc. No, victory has never smiled call to arms, to the fray, the attack; may our flag be planted tomorrow on the highest of those towers. No, victory has never smiled on happier hopes than ours! There glory awaits us - and the needful. There wait spoil, booty and honour. In my rival's arms! This thought pursues me everywhere like a persecuting demon. In my rival's arms! But as soon as dawn breaks, I'll run, I'll run to separate you. Oh, Leonora! What is it? Near the camp a gypsy was wandering: surprised by our scouts, she started to flee; rightfully fearing the wretch was a spy, they followed her. Did they overtake her? She's been taken. Have you seen her? No. The commander of the patrol gave me the news. Here she is. Forward, you witch, forward! Help! let me go! Ah, you raving men! What have I done wrong? Approach. Answer me, and don't dare lie to me! -Question me. Where are you going? I don't know. What? It's the gypsy's custom to move her wandering steps without any plan; the sky is her roof, and the world is her country. Where have you come from? From Biscay, whose barren mountains received me until now. (From Biscay!) (What do I hear! Oh, what a suspicion!) I lived days of poverty, yet happy in my condition, my only hope was my son. The ingrate left and forgot me! Abandoned, I wander about, hunting for that son, for that son who cost my heart horrible pangs! The love I feel for him The love I feel for him no other mother on earth has felt! (Her face!) Tell me: did you stay a long time in those mountains? Yes, a long time. Can you remember a child, a Count's son, stolen from his castle fifteen years ago, and brought thither? You... speak... who are you? The stolen boy's brother!- Ah! (Yes!) Did you ever hear the story? Not I! Let me follow my son's footsteps. ...Wait, foul wretch! You see who committed the horrible, ghastly deed. Go on. -She's the one! Be silent! She's the one who burned the child! Ah, monster! He's lying! Now you won't escape your fate! I beg you! Tie those knots tighter! Oh God! Oh God! Go ahead and shout! Why don't you come, Manrico, O my son? Won't you aid your wretched mother? Manrico's mother! Quake! -Oh, luck! Ah! Pray, loosen, barbarians, the chains that bite me so. This cruel torture is like a drawn-out death! Oh wicked son, worse than your wicked father, beware! God protects the helpless, and God will punish you, Your brood, foul gypsy, he? That seducer? With your torture then I can wound his heart! Joy floods my breast, which words cannot express! Ah, through me, my brother's ashes will have complete vengeance! What was that sound of arms I heard a moment ago? The danger is great: no use to disguise it! At dawn tomorrow we'll be attacked. Alas! What are you saying? But we will vanquish our enemies. Our daring, our arms, and our courage are equal to theirs. Go. During my short absence, I commit to your care the warlike work. Let nothing be missing. What a grim light shines on our wedding! Ah, me dear, rid yourself of any gloomy forebodings! How can I? Let love, sublime love, at this moment speak to your heart. Ah yes, my love, when I'll be yours, and you'll be mine, my spirit will be more fearless, my arm will be stronger. And yet, if on the page of my destiny it's written that I must be among the victims, pierced by the foe's steel, as I draw my last breath, my thoughts will come to you, and death will seem to me only preceding you to heaven. - Manrico? What is it? The gypsy... come... in irons... look.. Oh God! Those barbarians' hands have already lighted the pyre... Heaven! My legs fail me, my eyes are clouding over! You're raging! I should! Learn then: I am - Who? Her son!- Ah! Ah, cowards! This wicked sight almost takes away my breath! Get our men together! Hurry Ruiz! Go, go... And fly back! The horrible blaze of that pyre burns, enflames all of my being! Monsters, put it out; or very quickly I'll put it out with your blood! Before I loved you, I was yet her son; your suffering cannot restrain me... Unhappy mother, I hasten to save you, or at least, hasten to die with you! To Arms! To arms! Here we are, ready to fight with you, or die with you! To Arms! To arms! Here we are, ready to fight with you, or die with you! We've arrived; there's the tower, where the State's prisoners languish. Ah, the hapless man was brought here! Go... leave me, and don't fear for me. I can save him, perhaps. Fear for me? Sure and ready is my protection. Shrouded in this dark night, I'm near you, and you don't know it! Moaning wind, you who blow here, ah, mercifully take my sights to him. On the rosy wings of love go, oh mournful sigh; comfort the flagging spirits of the wretched prisoner. Like a breath of hope flutter in that room; waken in him the memories, the dreams, the dreams of love. But, pray, don't imprudently tell him the pangs, the pangs that rack my heart! Have mercy on a spirit approaching the departure which has no return. Have mercy on him, divine Goodness. Keep him from being the prey of hell. That sound, those prayers, so solemn and dire, fill the air with baleful terror! The distress that fills me almost deprives my lips of their breath, my heart of its beating! Ah! how slow Death is in its coming, to him who longs to die! Farewell, Leonora, Farewell! Oh heaven! I feel faint! Have mercy on a spirit approaching the departure which has no return. Have mercy on him, divine Goodness. Keep him from being the prey of hell. Over the horrid tower, ah, Death seems with wings of darkness to be poised! Ah, perhaps these doors will be opened for him, only when his corpse is already cold! I'm paying with my blood for the love I bore you! Don't forget, don't forget me, Leonora, farewell, Leonora, farewell! Forget you! Forget you! Forget you! Forget you! I feel faint! Did you hear? As dawn breaks, the son to the block, and the mother to the stake. Perhaps I'm abusing the power that the Prince freely gave me! That's what you drive me to, O my fatal woman! Where can she be? When Castellor was retaken, I had no word of her, and all our searching was in vain! Ah, where are you, cruel one? Before you. That voice! What? You, woman? - As you see. Why have you come? His last hour is approaching, and you ask me? You dared? Ah yes, I ask mercy for him! What? You're raving! Mercy! I? Show mercy to my rival? A clement God inspire you! I? Show mercy to my rival? A clement God inspire you! Vengeance is my only god Pity! Pity! I ask pity! Look, at your feet I shed a river of bitter tears; Isn't my weeping enough? Then stab me and drink my blood, trample upon my corpse, but save the Troubadour! Ah! I would like to make worse the unworthy man's fate, make him die a hundred deaths in a hundred horrible spasms. Then kill me... The more you love him, the worse my fury flames up! The more you love him, the worse my fury flames up! Triumph upon my corpse, but save the Troubadour! Count! Won't you stop? Spare him! At no price could you gain that. Move away! There is one price, just one; and I'll give it to you! Explain yourself. Tell me: what is this price? Myself! Heaven! What did you say? And I will keep my promise. Am I dreaming? Make way for me within those walls; let him hear me, let the victim flee, and I am yours. Swear it. I swear before God, who can see my whole soul. Ho there! (You'll have me... but as a cold and lifeless corpse.) He shall live. (He'll live! My joy strips me of words. O Lord, but with its hurried beating my heart renders thanks! Now, fearless, filled with joy I can await the end, dying I can tell him: I have saved you!) What are you whispering? Turn,turn your words to me again, or it will all seem a dream - what I heard before! He'll live! You're mine! Mine! Repeat it, reassure my doubting heart; ah, I can scarcely believe it, when I hear it from you! He'll live! My joy strips me of words, O Lord. Dying I can tell him: I have saved you! -Let us go! - You've sworn - My word is sacred! Mother, can't you sleep? I've invoked sleep time and again, but it flees from my eyes! I'm praying. Perhaps the chilly air is painful for your limbs? No, only I would like to flee from this tomb of the living because I feel that my breath is choking me. Flee! Don't be sad; the barbarians won't be able to torture me! - What? You see, the finger of Death has already set on my forehead its dark prints! Ahi! They'll find a corpse, mute and cold! No, a skeleton! Stop! Don't you hear? People are coming... The executioners... They want to drag me to the stake! Defend you mother! Nobody, rest assured. The stake! Nobody's coming here. The stake! The stake! The stake! That horrible word! Oh Mother! Mother! One day a ferocious mob led your grandmother to the stake! Look at the terrible flames! They're touching her already! Her burning hair already send sparks up to heaven! Look at her eyes, hanging out of their sockets! Ah! who will save me from this horrible sight! If you love me still, if a son's voice has power in a mother's breast, seek oblivion in sleep from the spirit's terrors, and rest and calm. Yes, weariness overcomes me, my son... I'll close my eyes in peace, but if you see burning the stake's horrid flames, then waken me. Rest now, mother, and may God grant less grievous images to your sleep. We'll go back to our mountains, and there enjoy our former peace! You'll sing... with your lute, and I'll sleep serenely. Rest, mother. Silent and alert, I'll turn my thoughts to Heaven. What! Does that feeble light not deceive me? It's I, Manrico, my Manrico! O, my Leonora! Ah! piteous Heaven, do you grant me such a great joy before I die? You won't die; I've come to save you! What? To save me? Can it be true? Farewell! Don't delay! Hurry! Leave! -And you're not coming? I must stay. Stay? Ah, flee! No! Woe if you delay! Your life! I scorn it! Leave! Leave! No! Your life! I scorn it! Still... O woman, look into my eyes! Who gave it to you? And at what price? You won't speak? A terrible thought! From my rival! I understand! This wretch sold her love.. Oh, how unjust! Sold a heart sworn to me! Oh, how your wrath blinds you! Oh, how unjust and cruel you are... Wretch! to me! Believe me! Flee! Or you're lost! Heaven itself can't save you! Ah! We'll go back to our mountains... Believe me! Flee! Or you're lost! Heaven itself can't save you! This wretch sold a love sworn to me! Go away! Don't drive me off! You see? My strength fails, I'm overcome, weak. Go! I detest you! My curse upon you! Ah stop, stop! Don't curse me; the time has come to pray to God for me! A shudder runs through my breast! Manrico! Woman! Reveal... tell me.. -I have death in my breast! Death! Ah, the poison's strength was more rapid than I thought. Oh, horror! Feel...my hand is icy, but here, here a terrible fire is burning! Heaven, what have you done! Rather than live as another's, I wanted to die yours! And I, a madman, dared curse this angel! I can't go on! Ah, hapless girl! The moment has come... I'm dying, Manrico. Father in Heaven, now I beg your forgiveness! (Ah, she wanted to deceive me and die for him!) Rather than live as another's, I wanted to die yours! And I, like a madman, dared curse this angel, Manrico! Leonora! Farewell, I'm dying... Take him to the block! Mother! Ah, Mother, farewell! Manrico! Where is my son? Hastening to his death. Ah, stop! hear me! See! Heaven! He's dead. He was your brother! He! What horror! Mother, you are avenged! And I still live!
