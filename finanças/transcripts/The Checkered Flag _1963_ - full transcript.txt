(triumphant music) (big band music) - [Announcer] Here we are at Sebring, Florida for the start of the International Grand Prix, a 12 hour grueling grind over a 5.2 mile course, one of the world's outstanding sports car racing spectaculars. Now you'll see the Le Mans countdown. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. They run from a standing start, leap into their cars, and move out onto the track. The race is off. At the start, number 21, driven by Briggs Rutherford is momentarily stalled. There they go, the field of 65 cars pass the clubhouse. Ferraris daring anybody to beat them an entire team of Corvettes, the Maseratis, the Porsches, they're all there. What a sight, as they compete for position in American road racing's greatest spectacular. The Corvette team has moved up to first place coming into the esses. It's Bill Garrison in Corvette number four, first in the pack. Briggs Rutherford is in about fifth place at this point. The whole field is strung out behind him in a magnificent array of some of the finest sports cars in the world. Negotiating one of the difficult hairpin turns is number 35, one of the red Ferarris. These are some of the most treacherous turns on any course, anywhere. (tires squealing) And, just look at that Ferrari eat up the concrete. Number 26, driven by Bill Hawkins is ahead of Rutherford and setting a blazing pace as they roar by pit alley. Bill Garrison is leading the Corvette pack with his foot clear through the firewall. Chasing number 26 and Rutherford, the American Corvette is really making a showing, running third against the foreign competition. Okay Charlie, let's take a look at the diagram of the actual course here at Sebring to show you exactly where we are. - [Charlie] From the start-finish line, the cars drift through three comparatively easy turns before heading into the esses, a series of short curves, then to the hairpin bend, shaped like its name. The next straight leads to the Webster turn, right and then left. The 90 degree turn opens into the fast airport straight, almost a mile long, where the cars hit top speed. The circuit concludes with two more straights. A total of 13 turns, plus the high-speed stretches. - [Announcer] Back to the race, we see Rutherford, number 21 with the red Ferrari, number 34 behind him. That's Rodriguez hot on his tail. Two Ferraris negotiate the S-turn and head for the straightaway, closely pursued by Rutherford. Garrison took car number 21, he passed Briggs on the hairpin turn. Car number 20, driven by Constantine, and number 23, driven by Nino Fatcherelli of Palermo, Italy, they are momentarily in the lead as Rutherford is closing fast and they move into the straightaway. The Porsche Spider makes its bid, followed closely by car number 80, a DB from Germany. Erickson is moving up on the inside and passes the Ferrari. (tires squealing) He spins up. Car number 34 goes by him. But, Garrison recovers and starts passing him again. Look at Garrison off the track, chasing Rodriguez, car number 34. He's passing everything on the road. The crowd screams as Garrison slides through the esses. Look at the twin Ferraris take that turn. Here's Rick Rutherford, number 21, going into the esses, with the Porsche Spider behind him, number 59. On the straightaway, we see a duel between the Porsche and the Corvettes. One of the Corvettes and one of the Ferraris are trying to slide by around the Porsche. The Ferrari makes it. Rodriguez and a tremendous burst of speed on the airport flat. Rodriguez is challenging Rutherford as they roar past the grandstand. Rutherford still holds a good lead as they roll by at speeds up to 160 miles an hour. Rounding the turn, we see Garrison has lost his fender. He slides through, out in front, ahead of Rutherford. He had managed to overtake Rutherford, and with tires screeching, they move around the airport turn once more. Bill is passed on the inside by Ferrari number 23. Listen to the tremendous roar of the crowd as these boys gear down going into the turn. Rodriguez has to make a pit stop. Watch as the pit crews work over these cars. Tires, gas, every possible detail is checked and personally overseen by Pedro, who is doing such a fabulous job here in Sebring. He will now be relieved by his brother Ricardo. Every minute lost in the pit equals a mile and a half of crucial racing time. Back on the course, he goes in hot pursuit of Rutherford. Rutherford really is pouring on the coal, outdistancing the Ferrari. Car number 21 refuses to give ground. We see Briggs Rutherford, the grand old man of racing, proving his mastery of the Sebring course. Now it's Rutherford's turn to make a pit stop. The grueling 12-hour drive continues well into the afternoon. The competition is as hot as the track. Garrison and his teammates in the Corvettes go by as Briggs goes back on the track, makes his move and passes. The grind is beginning to show. Ferrari number 36 is being pushed in by the driver. Nobody caddies for these boys. Number 46, the Porsche Spider has developed engine trouble, and its driver gamely walks back to the pits. Now one of the Corvettes has a pit stop. What kind of a job does this crew do? American bolt-on wheels require precious seconds of time. It's 95 degrees on the course and 110 in the cockpit. Look at those smoking tires. Briggs leading the pack on the corners is hotly pursued by two of Garrison's teammates as we go around the Webster turn at the end of the airport straightaway. Garrison is back on the track in Corvette number four. Look at that boy go. The crowd roars as he slides through the corner. Garrison is ahead. The Corvettes require maximum driving skill. They go down the straights with ease, but are sideways and on the ragged edge through many of the turns. Here's Rutherford, right on his trail. The Grand Touring Ferrari, driven by Bill Hill, makes a quick pit stop. Moving out, he is warned by the steward. And here's a candid view of the world's sports car champion, Sterling Love during his pit stop. Several cars are in for service and there is plenty of action in pit alley. The Porsche Spider, number 59, moves back on the course to seriously challenge the bigger and more powerful Ferraris and Maseratis. This has been a tremendous race today, but it looks like the weather is turning against us. The sky has clouded up and such, we are starting to get some rain. Night is falling and danger fills every second. Anything can happen with these breathtaking speeds and a wet track. But, look at those drivers throw caution to the wind, sliding through corners on a wet track. They are still holding speeds of better than 130 miles per hour. (tires squealing) Oops, there's a spin-out on the wet track, right under the Martini and Rossi bridge. Will he make it? Yes, he's back on track. What a trilling sight. That red Ferrari just started to slide. He's heading for the bridge. Holy mackerel, look at that car come apart, completely disintegrated. But look, miracle of miracles, the driver, Bill Hawkins, is being helped out and he is actually walking away. I can't believe it. Night descends on the track. Look at the beautiful rainbow. The track is drying up. Earlier this afternoon, 65 cars were looking for the pot of gold, and now the rainbow. The flash of headlights, looking like creatures from another planet, and the 37 cars that are left at dark continue to roar around the track. Night speeds here at Sebring increase only 15 to 20 seconds per lap. Each car and driver has covered a distance of well over 1,000 miles at average speeds near 100 miles per hour. Top speeds in the straightaways have exceeded 150 miles per hour. Today has brought heartbreak for many. Victory is in sight for several, but all who finish know that the 12-hour Sebring Grand Prix is the supreme test in American road racing for both men and machines. We are nearing the end of 12 hours of blazing, punishing action. What a race. Briggs Rutherford wins the 12-hour Grand Prix. Starter Jesse Colvin waves him across the finish line. Second spot goes to Ferrari number 28 driven by Ed Hume. We are waiting for third place. It looks like Bill Garrison in Corvette number four. Now, down in the pits, the Sebring Queen presents Briggs Rutherford with the Sebring International Cup. And, the tradition Sebring winner's kiss. Rutherford proves to be a fast man on the track and a slow one in the clinches. Rutherford's veteran driving skill, his experienced pit crew, and the superb performance of his car, has been responsible for his victory. The big surprise in today's race is Corvette number four, driven by Bill Garrison, placing third overall. Let's go down to Ralph Thomas down in the pits for an on-the-spot interview. - Congratulations on a fine race Bill. Would you like to say a few words for our TV audience? - Oh, I'd just like to say a few words to my friends in stock car circles, sorry I didn't do any better than third. - Do any better than third? Well, I'd say you did very excellent for your first outing here at Sebring. Tell me Bill, what made you make the big switch from stock cars to sport cars? - Money Bill, just plain ol' money. Give me anything with four wheels and an engine, I'll drive it, especially if the purse's so big. - Well, thank you very much and the best of luck to you in the future. - Thank you. - [Bill T.] Bill Thomas in the pits at Sebring. Thank you very much for be-- - So, he likes money. (laughing) Well, Mr. Bill Garrison, I think we will see a lot of each other. - Keep the change. Good morning darling. - Briggs, I'm disappointed in you. Why didn't you bring me your silver loving cup? - Well, from my report, I don't think you could stand another loving cup so soon. Thank you Allison. Oh, you can have the rest of the day off. - Oh, thank you Mr. Rutherford. - What was meant by that crack about the cup? - Now look Bo, let's get one thing straight. I don't give a damn about how many young men you keep, but, for God's sake, use your head. Don't bring them to this house. Remember, I do business with a lot of Puritans who frown on women like you. - What gall. You've got a hell of a room to talk. I'd hate to venture a guess on what kind of young thing you had at the races. Was she French or Cuban, or what kind of a variety did you have this time? - [Briggs] Well, at least I've got enough sense to keep them under cover instead of announcing to the world that I'm running around on my mate. (laughing) Oh? If you don't settle down, you're going to be replaced. - Don't try it Briggs. I'm warning you, don't try it. - With the witnesses I've got, there's not a judge in Florida who wouldn't grant me a divorce without a settlement or alimony. - What about your dirty laundry? - You need evidence, witnesses, you see Bo, you haven't been very smart. - Before I let you turn me out to pasture, I'll kill you Briggs. I've tasted high living a little too long to be handed my walking papers now. - Threats will get you nowhere darling. Ah, you're still a good entertainer of my business accounts. You still make a good appearance. Now, just lay off the bottle and the young bucks and-- (phone ringing) Yes? Oh, yes Stewart. I'll be out at the airport in about 45 minutes. Good. Alright, I'll see you there. Now, where were we? - I was entertaining your business accounts. - We'll discuss it later. If anyone wants me, I'll be at the fields testing that new grand prix car. - Don't break your neck. (laughing) - You should be so lucky. (dramatic music) - Hey, how's it goin? - Well, if it isn't Bill Garrison. Congratulations on your third yesterday. - Well, thank you, thank you. Hey, boy, would I like to give that baby a try. Hey, what's the chances of Briggs letting me drive her? - It's like asking him to depart with one of his mistresses. - With his dough, ah, what skin is it off his nose? - Mines not the reason why. - It's got plenty of power in the turns, but nothing in the straightaway. Change the gear ratio and I'll try her again. - Yes sir. - Briggs Rutherford, I'm Bill Garrison. - Garrison? I'm afraid I don't recognize the name. - You remember, I came in third yesterday in the Corvette. - Hey, take it easy with that car. I don't want that paint scratched up. What were you saying? - I said I came in third yesterday in the Corvette. - Oh, yes, you're the stock car driver who lucked his way into third place yesterday. - Well, I don't think it was luck. - How do you account for it then? - Well, I was far from being the fastest car in the race, so I think it must have been my driving. - Well, at least your not modest. What are you doing out here? - Since I got a taste of sports car racing, I thought I'd like some more. Word is that you've got the best cars in the business, I thought you might like to sign the best driver. - Ah, you really have got a nerve. One third place and you think you can walk up to me and I'll sign you up to the fastest racing team in the United States. You better come back and see me about three years sonny boy. Well, I wouldn't trust you with a Model T Ford, much less a $20,000 dollar grand prix car. Goodbye Mr. Garrison. - Yeah, well you're number one old man, only because of your money. Well I fought my way up to the top, and if it's the last thing I ever do, I'll make you a has-been of sports car racing. - This airfield is my private property Garrison. I suggest you get out of here before I throw you out. - Yeah, well, that I'd like to see you try. - [Man] You heard Mr. Rutherford, you better leave. - Alright, throw him in the back seat of his car and drive him outside of the gate. - Would you like some ice? I took the liberty of ordering some. - Well, I'm glad you made yourself at home. Would it be too much to find out who you are or what you want and how the hell you got in here? - So many questions. Which one would you like me to answer first? - How the hell did you get in here? - This opens any door I want. - Well, if you bought your way in here, I can't imagine what you want with me. - I'm Bo Rutherford. I wanted to meet you. - Bo, Bo Rutherford? You mean Briggs' wife? Well, I think one Rutherford is enough for today. - [Bo] What's Briggs up to now? - His three mechanics proved that if you work on cars it builds muscles. - His three mechanics? (laughing) What was that all about? - Well, I'm sorry I can't play your little game, but I've got a stock car race to drive tonight. I've gotta get cleaned up. - [Bo] I'd like to go with you. - Look, come on, what do you want? - [Bo] Why don't we talk about it tonight after the race? - I'll be busy after the race. - That's too bad. I thought you were the type of man who could use a large amount of money. - Make yourself at home, I'll only be a minute. (fast-paced music) - [Announcer] And the checkered flag, and it's Wild Bill Garrison picking up another checkered flag, the eighth in a row. - Now that we've finished my business, let's get to yours. Why did you come here to see me? - Still direct and to the point. Ordinarily I'd wait months before I approached anyone about what I want you to do. But, with you, I think I'm safe in putting my cards on the table, right now. - I'm all ears. - I'm serious. I can see you're a man who loves money and you don't care who you have to step on to get it. - Flattery will get you everywhere. - How would you like $50,000? - I'd like that fine. Who do I have to kill for it? - [Bo] My husband Briggs. - You know, I think you're serious. - [Bo] Dead serious. Are you interested? - Maybe. Would you like another? Why do you want to see him dead? - Money darling, money. The root of all evil. - [Bill] You don't look like you're hurting for money. - No now, but I could be. Briggs is thinking of divorcing me. If he does, he's got the grounds to cut me off without a penny. - [Bill] I take it, you've been a bad girl. - It's been fun. - It doesn't make sense, dollar-wise that is. Why should you pay me $50,000 when you could get some thug to do it for five? - Because no thug can drive a race car like you. - Well, that's true. - Bill, I've got it all planned out. It's so simple and no chance of getting caught. - Well, you make it sound easy. What do I have to do? - As the TV announcer said about you, just drive over it. - Well that's easy. You want me to see that he gets in a wreck and gets killed in the process. - Oh, you catch on fast. - You know, I could get killed making you a rich widow. - That's the risk you take for $50,000. - I don't know. - Bill, don't play hard to get with me. I'll tell you what I'll do, as a bonus, I'll throw in all the racing cars and equipment I have to buy for our venture. That way you'll be in the big-time racing with the finest available. - Bo, it's a pleasure working for you. - As your new boss, I order you to come here. - Isn't it bad to mix business with pleasure? - On the contrary, from now on that's just the way it's gonna be. (phone ringing) - I thought I told you I didn't want to be disturbed. Alright. Alright, I'll see him. Give me a few minutes. Honey, something important just came up, would you mind waiting in the other room for a few minutes? - Don't be long mi amor. - [Tom] Good to see you. - How are you Tom? - [Tom] Well, I'm fine, thank you. - Sit down. - [Tom] Thanks. - Have a cigar? - [Tom] Oh, no thanks Briggs, doctor's orders. - Well Tom, what brings you over here? - I'm sorry to disturb you Briggs, but something has come up at the bank and we feel that it merits your immediate attention. - Well, what's so important Tom? - Well, it's your wife Briggs. - [Briggs] Oh? - It has come to my attention, and we think it unusual, that she withdrew $15,000 from her savings account, and she wrote a check for $12,000 on checking, and the First National Bank phoned us asking for a recommendation. She's applied for a $50,000 mortgage on her beach house. - Well, Mrs. Rutherford always enjoyed spending money, but never in this amount. - Well, we thought you ought to know. - Oh yes Tom, I appreciate it. Did First National give her the mortgage? - No, not yet. We held back on our recommendation because we thought we ought to clear and check with you first. Shall we turn her down? - No. No, let her have it. - [Tom] Okay, whatever you say Briggs. - All these 12 and $15,000 checks, were they made out to anyone in particular? - No, but I got a report from the exchange cage. She bought a cashiers check for $23,000, made out to the Ferrari automobile factory in Italy. - Alright, thanks Tom, thanks for coming over. - [Tom] Well, it was a pleasure to see you Briggs. Say hello to BJ for me, will you? - I'll be glad to. It's always good to be of service. Good day. - Good day. (slow swing music) I want to put a call through to easy O in Madera, Italy. Find out what kind of car my wife is buying from the factory. Get complete details. Fine. And now, Miss Woodward, I don't want to be disturbed by anyone, is that clear? Good, I'll buzz you when I'm free. Senorita? Now, where were we? Come on Bill, wake up. I've got a present for you. - Couldn't you have given it to me back at the apartment instead of dragging me out at this ungodly hour? - Now darling, how would in the world would a brand new red Ferrari sit in bed with you? - Ferrari? Oh, you're kidding. - No. - Well, where is it? Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go. (smooth jazz music) - Get in, see how she feels. Hey, snap out of it. - Huh? - [Bo] What are you thinking? - Oh, I was just thinking how I'm gonna show everybody this baby's taillights. - [Bo] Well, are you gonna sit there all day? Why don't you try her out? - I'd love to, but I need somebody to check me out on the instruments. - (laughing) The very words I anticipated. Luigi. I'd like you to meet Luigi Selva. He came over from Italy with the car. - Hi, I'm Bill Garrison. I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other. - The pleasure's all mine senor. I will keep this car in excellent shape. - Well, how's chances of trying it out right now? - Si senor, let's a rolla the car out for testing. This is the oil temperature. Red line is 90 centigrade. Oil pressure gauge, maximum 90 pounds. Water temperature, 90 centigrade. Generator charge and discharge. 4800 rpm maximum on the tack. The speedometer is up to you. - Now don't you fall in love with this silly old car and forget all about me. - I just want you to know how much I appreciate this. - Just don't forget about the reason why I bought it for you. - Don't you worry Bo, you'll get your money's worth. - I'd better. Now then, give me a kiss and go try out your pretty little car. (engine starting) (tires squealing) - Muah, boy, this baby runs like a dream. Hey, hop in Bo, I'll give you a ride back to the hanger. - Now Bill, none of your wild ideas. - Come on now. I thought you liked to live dangerously. - That was wonderful. Don't I get a thank you for the present? (applauding) - A very touching scene, very touching indeed. Ah, Bo, for your age, you really get around. Must be life in the old girl yet. - What the hell are you doing here? - Oh, I just dropped around to see how my competition was shaping up, on the racecourse, that is. - Well, now that you've seen, you better shove off. - Excellent idea. But first, a few words of fatherly advice. Now Bill, this old dame's got something up her sleeve. Believe me, she doesn't go out and buy $50,000 worth of play things for a gigolo without some evil motive. - You don't have your three mechanics with you now Briggs, so I suggest you take my advice and leave right now. - Enough said. Good day folks. See you in Nassau. - He knows damn it, he knows. - All he knows is that I bought the cars for you. He couldn't have found out about our other plans, only you and I know that. - Well, he's suspicious, how'd he find out about the cars? - The factory must've notified him. Bill, let's not worry about it. Everything will work out alright, you'll see. - I wonder. (marching band music) - Do you think you've had enough practice in old yella? - I don't know. I just had the feelin' of that Testorossa down pat when that engine blew. But, a car's a car. And, old yellow there, she's got enough torque coming out of the corners to keep on Briggs' tail. - Would it be asking too much if we got lucky and killed the old fool in our first race? - Now, don't get your hopes up so soon, I'm just gonna stay behind him and feel him out. - Well, he's a good driver Bill, so please be careful. - Now, don't you worry about me. I can take care of myself. - Bring home his head on a silver platter darling. - (laughing) You are the bloodthirsty one. - Hiya fella Aber. Hey. Bo wouldn't like to see her driver lying down. - Is that so? - No, she likes to see her gigolos working. - Well, just ignore me. - How can I? You being 20 years my junior, you're sure to outrun me. (laughing) But, have no fear, the tortoise will catch the hare within two laps. - I wouldn't bet on that old man. - Just a friendly little bet, say 1,000? - Alright, you're on. - [Announcer] There they go in the Le Mans start of the Governor's Cup race here at Nassau. There are more than 75 cars in this demand start roaring down the course, heading into the esso bend. All the great names in international racing are here today, including Briggs Rutherford, this year's winner of the 12-hour Grand Prix in Sebring, Florida. It looks like a great start for this 25 lap set. The course is a five mile, flat circuit, and this year, many of the drivers have complained about the roughness of the track. Briggs Rutherford is out in front as they go into the second curve of the course. Look at him take those corners. (mumbles) right on the edge. Rutherford spins out in his Cooper Maserati, and he's being passed by Bill Garrison in car number 53. Garrison is driving the famous old yellow. This American-powered car seems to be making a strong bid today against a more sophisticated Italian racing machine. Rutherford recovers and goes hard after car number 53. Folks, he's really got his foot in. There's a near miss with car number 92. That was a close one. Car number 92 now makes a bid to catch 77 as the tension builds here at Nassau. Down the straightaway, the field is accepting the blistering pace set by Rutherford and car number 53 and that track is rough and dangerous. Oakes Field, the scene of this race here in Nassau, 11 months out of the year is an unused airfield and many of those curves are covered with treacherous pots of fine sand which will cause many a spin out before this race is through. Number 77 is back in the lead, having passed old yellow on the straightaway. And, here they come past the Goodyear tower. Now, over on the backside, car number 22 has spun out and almost went through the crowd. More action on the back stretch, Rutherford spins through a corner and makes a complete circle. But, he's back on the track and still in the lead. Luckily, no one was hurt when number 22 headed for the crowd, but the ambulance was dispatched just in case. Yes, I believe he's out of the race. A bent wheel knocked out the chances of another key driver to take home the Governor's Cup. Bill Garrison in 53 is again challenging Rutherford off the straightaway. Vital information to the driver of car number 46 by his pit crew, and the field of 75 cars is battling it out in front of the stands. Rutherford's Maserati has tremendous maneuverability on those curves, but old yellow seems to have the advantage of power. Read skill is required to hold a car with that kind of power on these treacherous sandy turns. 77 and 53 are neck and neck, but oh, look, Rutherford is crowding Garrison against the caution, refuses to give him racing room. And there goes Garrison into a bad spin. Man, oh man, what a spot. This maybe the wrong sport, but it looks like Garrison is the victim of a sand trap. The race continues, Rutherford's in the lead with plenty of pressure from the field. (big band music) - What happened, are you alright? - Yeah, he just got the best of me in the corner, that's all. - You mean you let him out-drive you. - Now what's that supposed to mean? - Nevermind, forget it. - No, no, no, you come out with it. - Look lover, I've got over $50,000 tied up in you and I expect you to keep our bargain. - Just be patient, will ya. I'll get him next time. - I'm beginning to wonder. You know, I think maybe Briggs was right, maybe I should stick with younger women. - You come back here. - I can drive circles around that old fool. - Of course you can darling. - Bo's got a hell of a nerve talking to me like that. - Oh, forget her. Come on. Let's have another drink. - That's a good idea. Waitress. Waitress. - Shh. - Two more of the same please. - Not so loud. - Now here's Vince Martin with the calypso salute to Nassau's own speed week. ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ It all began back in '54 ♫ Three fine men were debating ♫ When they got through they had settled the score ♫ Speed week was in the making ♫ Everybody ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ Sterling Moss knows he's the boss ♫ In '56 had no worry ♫ He passed Gregria, Colonial, Benson ♫ Out of my way, I'm in a hurry ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hello broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ Nascar drivers are plenty tough ♫ Bill Frantz and Curtis together ♫ When they start wheelin' the going's rough ♫ For other cars they are bad-weathered ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ Jim Shepherds, he's a Milwaukee Brave ♫ No man on wheels is he fearing ♫ Jim Rathman makes the ladies rave ♫ He drives for Earl Engineering ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ Win or lose it's the king of sports ♫ Play it straight down the middle ♫ May the best man win, now let's drink a toast ♫ To speed week at the Canon Fiddle. ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' ♫ And again now ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ Hell broke loose on the island ♫ Speed week, speed week ♫ It's the time of your life you'll be havin' (applauding) - Hey, you're gorgeous.

Alright come on girls, bottoms up and we'll go in and have another drink. - After this ride, we could certainly use it. - There's a couple of girls after my own heart. Dinner is served. - [Bill] That poor donkey. - What'd you say Bill? - That poor little donkey. - [Woman] We almost get killed and he's worried about that ass. - I bet he's scared to death. I gotta make it up to him. That's what I've gotta do, I've gotta make it up to him. Is he alright, huh? - No man, just a little scared. - Look, let me take him to the house for a drink. - No man, I couldn't do that, we've gotta go home. - Huh? - We've gotta go home. - Well, look, I ain't gonna hurt him you know. Oh, look, let me, let me buy him. Here, there you go. - Well, ah. - Is that enough? - Yeah man, that's just fine. - Alright, fine. Oh, what's his name? - Sir Richard. - Sir Richard.

(mellow music) Operator, would you connect me with the taxi cab company? I live on Sterling Road. Fine, thank you. Ah, this is Briggs Rutherford, would you send a taxi out to my beach house on Sterling Road? Good, thank you. (smacking) - [Woman] Ow Briggs, you're too rough. - I hate to disturb you sweet things, but, you better get dressed, a taxi's on its way. (sighing) - [Woman] What's wrong with him? - [Briggs] Oh, you mean Garrison, my arch-enemy? - Enemy? - My dear, if this little bottle could talk, I'd know what happened to the other half of my life. - Good grace. - Oh, you're terrible. - Alright, come on, let's get dressed. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, let's go. - What the hell's going on around here? Rutherford? What are you doin' here? - I happen to live here. Since it's my house, you better depart. - Boy, I really must have laid one on last night. - I'm afraid we're both victims of the spirits. Since we're now reasonably sober, I prefer to continue as arch-enemies. - Well, I'll go along with that. - Hey. That way. Long way to Nassau. There's a taxi on its way. - Oh, well I'll wait outside. - Hey, girls, come on, hurry up. The taxi'll be here any minute. (knocking) Come on. Hey, what's keeping you? - I don't wanna leave. I like it here. - Well, honey, I'm beat. - Why don't you drive us into town this afternoon? - Oh, you girls must think I'm 21. After last night, I'm gonna relax. (laughing) - Oh, Briggs. - Why you little minx. - Come on, be a sport. - No, you've still got to go. - Please Briggs, come on. You are terrible. - I think I can help change your mind huh? - Well, we'll see. (tires squealing) (laughing) - [Woman] Come on, can't we stay, please? - Oh, honey, the rest of the afternoon with you and I'd be in a wheelchair. - Maybe that night. - Oh, there's your cab, now, come on. - [Woman] Oh, I think you're so mean. (honking) - Hey Garrison, give my love to Bo. (sighing) - Is that all you've got to say for yourself? - Oh, let's not cry over spilt milk. - [Bo] You've got a hell of a nerve. - Alright, aright, so I went out and got drunk and had another woman, you don't exactly vomit every time another man comes around. - [Bo] That's not the point. I've got over $50,000 tied up in you lover and I don't like my investment getting temperamental. - Look, can't we talk about this another time? - [Bo] No we can't. Don't forget Bill, you've got a lot at stake too. There's no time to talk about it later. - Alright, alright, alright, have it your own way. - Time's running out on me Bill. I can be discarded like an old shoe anytime Briggs feels like it. I've got to kill him now, next month might be too late. - Money's just like a magnet, isn't it Bo? It's the only thing that draws us together again. - I wanna tell you something Bill. Something that happened a long time ago, so long ago that it seems it happened in another lifetime. If you look at my hands now, you'd never know that when I was a kid they were calloused and dirty and sore. From the time I was five until I was 16, I traveled from one migrant farmers camp to another. I saw my drunken sod of a father beat my mother to death because she tried to hide enough money to buy food for us kids instead of wine for the old man. I made up my mind that when I married there was never going to be a shortage of money. No Bill, I've done without money once in my life but never again. - We're two of a kind Bo. Money's always haunted me too. You're right. It's now or never. - Now, that's more like my old Bill. - Now, let's see, I've got to figure out a way to nail him. He's too smart to let himself get boxed in on the corners. He's got to have a flaw somewhere in his driving, but where? Where? - [Bo] I wish I could help. - Well think, think back over the years, isn't there something he's mentioned, some complaint he's had about his driving that he's told you or his mechanics? - I'm sorry. Brigg's the the type who'd never admit he's got a fault. He even raves over himself when he watches his movies. - Movies? What movies? - Oh, he always has a couple of cameramen walking around the course, filming his progress in the race. - Well, that's it. If I could study those films, I know I could pick out a flaw. - Maybe you're right. - Well, how do we get them? - He keeps them in the library. I could have a servant fly them over by tonight. - If I could see those films tonight, tomorrow's race would get results. - Hello operator, I'd like to call long distance to Miami, Florida. - Well, that's the weakness we have to take advantage of. Now, I'll stay hot on his tail, and the minute he looks over that right shoulder that'll leave his left side blind. And then (snapping), I'll nail him. - Tomorrow might be the biggest day in our lives. (engine revving) - What was his a time? - 3:19, he's knocking about two seconds a lap off Briggs. - Good, good. When senor brings in the pits, do you think it's a good idea to bring Bill in a now? - I want him to keep a close second. He can catch him, I'm sure of it. - Excuse me for saying it, but, if I were the owner of this car, I would a gamble. - And why Luigi? - I feel Bill has enough a gasoline a to finish the race a. His tires are a good. And, with senor Briggs in the pit, now is a time to get a good lead. - Unfortunately, you are not the owner Luigi. I want the car to have a new set of tires and a full tank of fuel. - Si senora. (tires squealing) - [Bill] Yeah, what do you want? - You're only 15 seconds behind him. This is it Bill, keep on top of him. - I could win this race, you know, if you didn't pull me in, you know that don't ya? - There'll be plenty of races to win in our future darling, after we clean up a few details. It's still my money. - Yeah, that's right, but I'm takin' the chances. So, I've decided to share them with ya. - [Bo] I don't follow you. - Oh, I've got myself a little insurance policy. - [Bo] What do you mean? - I've written it all down, even to where it happens on the Windsor turn. If I go, you go too. A little thing I call double indemnity. - [Luigi] Car's ready Bill. (big band music) (screaming) - Bill. Bill. Bill, Bill, can you hear me? (coughing) We gotta get outta here. Bill, wake up. We've got to get away from here. - I guess I hit him a little too hard huh? (gasping) Did I get him? - [Bo] You did. - Well, eh. That makes you a rich widow. - [Bo] Where is it Bill, tell me, where is it? - What do you take me for, a damn fool? Look at Briggs, Bo, he's watching us. In fact, he's laughing at us. - [Bo] He's dead and I want that evidence. Where is it Bill? Tell me, tell me, tell me. (exploding) (dramatic music) (mellow music) - Hey, it says here that that Moss has signed with Ferrari this coming season. Well, did you hear me Bo? - [Bo] Bill, you know I'm not interested in racing anymore. Keep the sports section to yourself. (bell ringing) Martha. Martha. Where is that girl? - I gave her the day off. - [Bo] You gave her the day off. And may I ask why? Well, then would you mind pouring my coffee? - You blind old bat Come on, can't you be more careful? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forgive me Bill. You've got to give me time to adjust. You don't know what it's like not being able to see. Oh, God, blindness is pure hell for me. You've got to give me time Bill. - Me give you time? Me give you time. The only thing I'll give you is what you deserve. Don't you realize that time is your enemy Bo, not your ally. And your time is runnin' out Bo. - What do you mean? - [Bill] How long do you expect me to live this vegetable existence? I intend to be my own executioner Bo. And when I go baby, you go too. What's more, there's nothing you can do about it, or I'll see that the state takes care of both of us. And you won't know how Bo, you won't know when. You'll only know when it happens. Oh, you taught me to be a professional killer Bo, and now I feel like practicing. It's the last thing I'll ever do Bo. It's the last thing, the only thing left.
