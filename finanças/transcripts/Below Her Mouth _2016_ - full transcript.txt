- Oh my god. Hey. Did you come? - A bit. - What's wrong? - I don't know. - Tell me the truth. - There's nothing. Don't start getting hyper. - I'm not getting hyper. I'm in love with you. You're over me. Say something. - Something. - Grow up. - I'm moving out. - I think you should. - I put a deposit on an apartment. - I gotta go to work. - Dallas! - You're better off without me. - Why? - I'll call you later. - Hey sweetheart! Pass the keys, let me take it for a ride. - I'd take her for a ride. - Hey, why do ladies love roofers? - You should pick me up and go like that. - Hey, babe. What time is it? - Time to go. - Is it? I'm up. - Just wait. - What is this? - What? - What do you mean what, what is this? Did you paint my nails? - Mhmm. - Why? - You have the most gorgeous nail-beds. - I feel violated. - What? Why? - I don't know it's fucking weird. Okay look baby I gotta go. Would you take that off please? - I just want one picture. - You're not taking a picture of me. - Hello. Welcome back. - Fuck off. - Already drinking alone? - There's one left for you. Do you want one? - Yeah. - Where's your thing? Over there. Okay, what's up? Talk to me. You just walked out on her? - Kind of. I got better things to do. I don't wanna play house right now - She wasn't right for you. - I'm buzzed. - I gotta catch up. - You won't catch up. No one will ever catch me. - What time is Claire coming over? - She's on her way. - I'll call you in the morning. - What's the time difference in Arizona? - Two hours. - Call me when you get to the hotel. - Do you think you'll be up that late? - Probably not. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. - Don't try to keep up with Claire. - I never do. - Hey, Dallas. - Yes, Joslyn. - When are you picking up the rest of your stuff. - What stuff? - Stuff that you don't want donated to goodwill with your name and address on it. You have 20 minutes. Hmm, I can't be there in 20 minutes, I have a party to get to. Throw it out. Don't call me about this stuff anymore. I wanna be amicable with you and phone calls of this nature piss me off. You know me better than to think I give a shit where my stuff ends up. - Even inanimate objects are not safe from you. - What, fine. Stop calling, if you know that's the case. - Buzz kill. - I bought a few new things. - I like to boil and recycle. - I'm starting over. You see anything? - Nothing. - Hot girls are never on time. What about us? - We're not hot girls. - I'm wearing women's clothing. - On the outside. - I'm calling firsts on the bartender. - Too bad she likes me. - You can back off if I like a girl. I've been after her for months. - You don't get it. - Maybe you don't get it. - I'm taking a lap. - You can handle it. - This is cute. - Where should we go first? - It's a girl party! - Let's keep walking. - We're going in. - What do you want to drink? - I'm okay. I'm going to find the bathroom. - Excuse me. She's ignoring me. - I'll be right back. - I think I'm being overlooked. - I got you. Desiree. What do you want? - Hey! - Hey! Were you on my street today? - Thought you looked familiar. You come to girl parties often? - I don't come at all. - Terrible news. Can I change that for you? - My friend is waiting for me. - What's your name? - Jasmine. - Don't be rude. Dallas, named after the American television show my parents fell in love within Sweden. - Did you grow up in Sweden? - What gave me away? Am I talking funny? - You're talking fine. I'm curious. - About? - Why do women love roofers? - You have to go out with me if you want to find out. - I need to get some air. - What was that? - My ring. - Ouch, it's a weapon. You're engaged. My condolences. - Now you're being rude. - I'm just being honest. - See you. - Why do women love roofers? - No idea. - Because we strip'em and nail'em all daylong. - Sounds exhausting. - I'll be on the same street tomorrow, if you want a demonstration. - I'll pass. - Let me buy you a drink? - Pass again. - Wait. We're not done talking. - I left my friend alone. - Your friend found company. Has he been saving since he was a little boy? - He's good with his finances. - I was almost engaged. I thought about buying a ring for my ex. I even googled it. I got my own apartment instead. - Rile and I just moved out of our first apartment. - How's the sex after all the living together. - It's good. - I've got no emotional stamina for intimacy. - I know how to keep him interested. - I think I might be different with you. - Keep saying that and you might find the right girl. - What if you're the right girl? - I'm engaged. - Why are you being so crazy! - Because I have to wake up early. - We were having a good time. - At my expense. - What? - I should listen to my instincts. - Jasmine! - What are you talking about? - She kissed me. - What did you do? - I kissed her back. - What? - I feel sick. - Did you like it? - Claire, I'm not answering that. - I'm just curious. - Don't talk about that, it's not about that. I feel weird. - Because you like her? - Because I'm engaged. - Oh please, Jasmine. You're the most faithful person I know. You and Rile are like Mary and the fuckin carpenter. - It will never happen again. - Giddy-up! - What time you done? - Rile? - Hey, I just got to the hotel. - I want to get married in the garden, at the Old Mill. - okay baby. Okay that's great. Call the planner in the morning. I'm red-eyed. I got to go sleep. - K, I love you. - I love you. - I'm coming! - I'm awake. - Hey, I gotta get to work. - I have stuff to do too. - Cool, I'm leaving the spare key. You'll probably see Quinn before you see me again. Just give it to her. - Actually, can you just give me a ride. - I gotta go! Here grab a cab. - Morning. - Morning. - You didn't say goodbye last night. - I'm late for work. - What do you do? - I work in fashion. - Retail? - I'm an editor for a fashion magazine. - Does that mean you're the boss? - It's more complicated than that. - I'm the boss. This is my company. My site. What are you doing later? - I'm working late. - I'll be here until dark finishing upthis job. - Cool. - I'll be done and you'll never have to see me again. - Bye. I want her nude on top. - She wants you nude on top. - Is that fur? - There is no way I will ever put that on my naked body, it's in my contract, no fur. - I'm an anti-fur advocate. Why is there a fur coat on your set? - You think that's real? - It looks real. Even if it's not I'm not putting it on. - The coat is faux, it wouldn't be on my set otherwise. - Was that true? - It worked. I want to be home before dark. - I'll wrap it up. - You change your mind? - One drink, one. And we're done. - I'll be back in an hour. You trying to kill me? - Nice outfit. Thanks. Stop it. - Stop what? - You're staring at me. - I'm not. You were saying that you're a brilliant fashion editor. - I never said that. - Tell me what you said? - I had an opportunity to go to New York. - What happened? - Rile got promoted. - So. - I made a sacrifice. - Sounds like martyrdom to me. - You'll understand someday. - Don't be condescending, I understand the concept of sacrifice. I would have made you go, in fact I would have gone with you. - That's sweet. You're really sweet. I like your style. I like your edge. It's just that my style is engaged to a man. Can we get the bill? Don't come any closer. - Come to my place. - I'm leaving. - Stop torturing yourself. - You are torturing me. Take me somewhere. - You want me to take it off? - Hello. - Jasmine? You sleeping? - No, no, I'm awake, I dazed off for a few minutes. - Did you call the planner about booking the wedding? - I haven't had time. - I'll take care of it. I'll call her before my meeting this morning. The storm is really bad here. I guess I'm not golfing this weekend. Hello? Sorry. - Are you okay sweetie? - Bridget and I are working. We had some work to do. She just got here. - Okay you're busy, say hello for me. Try to take some time for your self this weekend. - I should get going. - Me too, love you. - Morning. - Is it you? - It's me. - You're persistent. Look at you pushing. - I gave myself a hernia. My mom told me if I acted more like a girl, I wouldn't get hurt all the time. - Did you want to be a boy? - I just unwanted her to let me be. - Can I have it? - Where will you keep it? - I'll frame it and admire it and all of your tomboy strength. - Tomboy. I didn't like being called that when I was a kid. I couldn't hide it, but I just didn't like being called out on it. Besides, I'm not a tomboy I'm more legit than that. - Okay, legit tomboy. Kiss me. I've never done anything like this before. - I don't usually tell the truth about my past. - Because you have so much to hide. - I'm not hiding anything from you. - What did your mom say when you became a roofer? - She's pissed about it. She pushed me to leave Sweden for university because she didn't want me working on a roof with my dad. My dad used to tell me I couldn't go up on any roofs without him. Fuck that, he didn't even have to teach me. It's like I was born with suction cups for feet. I hated being a kid. - I'm holding you to one positive memory. - I liked helping my dad build stuff. I liked the rain, even though I wasn't allowed to play in it. My mom's cooking and that she used to iron my underwear into perfect squares. - What was it like for you? - My dad made me laugh all the time, he's witty and silly. My mom is supportive, as long as she approves. When I was a teenager I had a summer thing with a girl named Denise. - That doesn't surprise me. - You remind me of her. We were inseparable, we kissed once. It lasted like four seconds. My mom walked in and freaked. I wasn't allowed to say goodbye. I never saw here again. - You just obeyed? - Of course. It took me a long time to forgive my mom. I pretended everything was fine. She tried to set me up with anyone with a penis and a job. I stopped thinking about that part of myself and did what was prescribed. Can bury that story. It's like it never even happened. How old were you when you came out? - Young. - Young? How old is young? - I don't tell my coming out story. - You're seriously not going to tell me? - Why do I have to have one? - I promise not to tell anyone you have one. And I'll never ask again. - Which story do you want it's not one that ever ends. Like last month I came out to the forklift operator at the roofing supply store. - The first time you were with a woman. - It wasn't a surprise or anything. I was only ever attracted to women. - You never got that flooding rush that things could be different for you? - Every time I look at you. - I'm waiting. You have until the sand runs out of my hand or you'll never see me again. What will you know it for? Guess I'll see you around. It's not that exciting. The first time a girl had sex with me. She topped the fuck out of me until seven in the morning. I didn't know what I was doing. - Dickies had changed. - I was only 16. She was like 30 or something. We both got what we wanted and that's that. - How did your parents react? - My dad says he can't control who I love. I always wanted them to love each other more. I don't want to loose you. I can't breathe. You're so pretty. I want you to stay. - Shh, be quiet. I could eat blueberry pancakes at every meal. I'll go get some. I'm going to starve to death in your bed. - I'm going to build a fortress. - I'll visit you. - I'm memorizing every part of you. - I not wanna think about my life. The outside. Have you ever tried to count how many breaths you take in a minute? - I tried, I stopped breathing. - It takes your breath away. - I don't like goodbyes. - Will you drive me home? - I'm going to get us lost. - I love this house. - I know you do. - Look, that's my favorite tree. - Where? - There. - I don't see it. That sad and lonely looking thing? Oh baby, it needs to be cut off. I can bring my chainsaw over for you. - Don't you dare. - Don't ever fuckin do that again. - It was supposed to be frisky. - Kidding. Frisky? - I gonna go in now. - Hit me. - Why? - Do it again. Or I'll do it back. - You wouldn't? That hurt. - Do it. I want to see you tomorrow. - I can't. He'll be home tomorrow morning. I can't see you again, Dallas. Hi it's Jasmine leave me a message. - Hey child, ah it's me. Your are sleeping already I called you ealier to let you know our golf game got rained out - I'm coming home, no point in sticking around. - I'll wait for a cab. I'll see you soon. - Don't get me going. - Get out and play with me. - Not in here. - I want to see you again. - I can't. Rile, stop! - What the fuck. What the fuck did I do to you? Don't touch me. Don't you fucking touch me. You didn't even see me, standing there, You just... you were gone. - She's a woman. - It doesn't matter. - Tell me what I need to do to fix this to put us back on track. - But you're a lesbian. - You've known me for six almost seven years. - I thought I did. - I still love you. Nothing has changed between us. - I saw it with my own eyes, Jasmine. - I can't lose you. - End it. - It's over. - No, I want you to end it in person or you'll never see me again. - Can I shower, I'll go before work. I'm messy know. - You want to look good for her? Come on let's go. - I'll do it. I'm so sorry I left you. I had to run after him. Rile's waiting outside. - Why? - I need to end this. I don't want to. - You have to. I shouldn't have put you in this position. - I wanted it, I still do. - I don't want you like this. - Because you can't be in something. - Jasmine! What kind of something would this be? You're wearing an engagement ring that someone else gave you. - Drop me off at work. Hey! You okay? Here. - Thank you. - Can I have a receipt? Rile. - Why you never like that with me? - Can you try too? What's the point? - To what? - I love her. - Desiree? - No. Jasmine. - She's straight. - You don't know. - Does that mean you're gonna lay Desiree a few bit Desiree? - Come on. - What? Where you going? - We were just talking about you the other day. - Here I am. Two bourbons and NU. - She might be upstairs. - She knows I'm coming I texted her. - Here, she'll be happy to see you. And there she is. - Where have you been? - I was in a thing. - What about new? - On my own again. - Does this mean you'll visit more often? - You and your filthy paws are outta of here. Paying customers only. No free rides kids. - No free shows pervert. - You have some fuckin balls. - How'd I get here? - You haven't told me yet. - I am toxic for you. Because I don't love you the way you love me. Sorry. - Can I come in? - I'm so sorry for what I did. - I know you are baby. - It gone me better. - Let's get out. - Okay? - Hey, hey... babe... it's me. - I'm so sorry. - How was your day? - I told some of my friends at work about you. - What did you tell them? - Everything.
