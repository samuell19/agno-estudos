24.000 English from SDH sync from 23.976 ? 12.01.2022 When Justice Fails (1999) Check her out, bro. She's sweet, huh? You want an intro? Yeah, right. Go get her, killer. Hello, gorgeous. What do you say we have a little talk? Beat it. That's all I ever do. Hey! My, that's a big one. Oh, the shame of it all. What would my mother think? Say hello to your new partner. - Kolb. - What's up, Lieutenant? Where's Chaney? He's in the bull pen licking his wounds. You're a real joker, huh? That was a stupid move. What? Chaney, I wanna see you in my office for a second. I hear you already met your new partner. I guess some of the guys figured you could use a good laugh, huh? Yeah, it was funny. Give it a break, will you? Come on, some of the guys had some fun. Lambeau, I want you to meet your new partner, Tom Chaney. The man with the big gun. Lambeau got transferred up from the Seventh Precinct. He's a good cop. You can show him Taylor's old desk, huh? All right. That's it. Go solve a crime. Thank you. So what do you know about me? That you had a partner who was dirty. He's a good guy. He just made a few mistakes. - How about you, Rambo? - No, no. It's Lambeau. - Lambeau. You got a first name? - Yes, I do. It's Rod. - Rob. - No, it's Rod, Rod with a D. Rod. Let me ask you somethin', Rod. You always dress like that, or was that a special occasion? It's no special occasion. I was undercover. That's good 'cause I was wonderin'. Well, you can stop wondering. I don't dress up. Here's your new home. However, I am gay. Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. Well, what do you think about that, your partner being gay? Depends what you expect out of the relationship. What I expect is for you to show me the same respect that I show you. That way, maybe we can become trusting partners and maybe friends. Can you handle that? Rod, let me tell you somethin'. My last partner, he was dirty. But he was the only cop on the force that liked me. My wife, she left me three years ago. And believe it or not, my dog just ran away last week. I do not have any friends. To tell you the truth, I could use one. Can you handle that? I'm glad to see we're off to such an auspicious start. - A what? - Yeah. You two, Chaney, Lambeau, you're up. Homicide. 7th Avenue & 34th Street. Let's go. I'll see you over there. Here we go. Well, well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack. - What are you girls doin' here? - Eh, we were in the neighborhood. Just thought I'd stop by and see what you were up to, asshole. Guess he didn't like his new do. Maybe your partner there could have recommended a new hairdresser. All right, get him in. Say, Tom. My girlfriend, she's been bugging me about a new entertainment system. I was thinking maybe you can hook me up with a hot VCR, CD player, I don't know. You know what I'm sayin'? Outta my face, asshole. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Stay out of it, faggot. Now say, "I'm sorry. I'm such a jerk." - Say it. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm such a jerk. What's goin' on? Just screwin' around, sir, break the tension. Oh, it's nice to see you're havin' a good time. What's Chaney doin' here? He's primary on this case. Why? Is that a problem for you? - No, I guess it's not. - Good. Who found the body? The housekeeper. She came in to change the sheets and found Mr. Clean over here. - How long has he been dead? - 12 hours, give or take. - How? - Beats me. We'll have to wait for the autopsy report. Look what I got. Victim's name is Dean Harvey. He was a perpetrator. He was in court last Monday, aggravated assault, beat up some woman so bad he almost killed her. And then he got off. Anything else on him? I checked with the D.A. He's got the jacket on him. Your boy Harvey had quite a jacket. Listen, I gotta be in court in five minutes. Would you mind walking with me? Typical repeat offender. Numerous complaints-- rape, aggravated assault-- yet he only appears twice. Now, you wanna speak to Katy Wesson. She's the one who prosecuted the case. - Wesson. Like in the oil? - No. Like Smith & Wesson. She's a real loaded pistol: smart, tough, does her homework. You pull her as defense, you might as well pack up your briefcase and go home. She's got your man dead to rights. - Well, what happened to Harvey? - Oh, you win some, you lose some. She doesn't lose many. She's got a 99% conviction rate. No one even comes close. First-time offenders, no probation, no kickdowns, nothing. She even got the judge turning a deaf ear. Amazing thing is she really is deaf. A deaf and dumb prosecutor? Let's be politically correct here: hearing-impaired. They're downstairs. - This I gotta see. - Well, you're in luck. She's in evidentiary hearing right up those stairs, courtroom five. Okay. Thanks. When Mr. Boxler opened the door, what did you see? I could see past him into the bedroom. Ms. Delgado was chained to the bedpost, and she looked scared. Thank you, Detective. No more questions. Your Honor, may counsel approach the bench? You may. We have an evidence problem here. The police found Ms. Delgado's clothing while they were rummaging through Mr. Bosler's garbage. Officer Landy then sent his partner to obtain a search warrant to enter the premises. The trash bin was on private property and already been searched before the officers had obtained the proper warrant. My colleague here is being hyperscrupulous, but I'll take his word. For the sake of justice, the people are willing to omit from the record the evidence in question. The evidence in question has already been marked for identification and introduced and the jury unduly prejudiced. Move for dismissal. Granted. The suspect imprisoned her against her will, chaining her to his bed and repeatedly raping her over a period of six hours. You can't throw this out on a mistake that's open to interpretation. The law is very clear. What about justice? Who's going to speak for Cynthia Delgado and all the other women who have been assaulted and degraded? My job is to interpret and uphold the law. Justice is sometimes a double-edged sword. Case dismissed. Smile all you like. I'm submitting a motion for retrial. I'll see you back in court. - She sure is a loaded pistol. - Yeah. Looks like her conviction rate just went down to 97%. When we went over that arrest report, you both swore to me that you follow the letter of the law to a tee, that it was a legal search and seizure, and that the trash bin was on public property. Look, it was an innocent mistake. Your innocent mistake allowed a rapist to go free. Ms. Wesson. Excuse me, Ms. Wesson. I'm Detective Chaney and this is my... could you help me out here a little bit? She can read lips perfectly. Yeah? I was very impressed with you in court. - What'd she say? - I think she told you to beat it. That's all I.. I ever do. Yeah, I heard that one. Now what? Let's go and.. You know what, let's go check out Dean Harvey's last victim. There's been a lot of bad office gossip about me and Dean Harvey. - Did he hurt someone else? - No. Somebody hurt him. I hope they got him bad, that sadomasochistic creep. I hope he got what was coming to him. You know what that sick creep did to me after he was through? He took off his belt and beat me with the buckle. Then he took a lit cigarette. Tell me he's dead. He's dead. You're serious? I'm dead serious. Wow. Where were you last night? At a poker club playing cards till 4:00 in the morning. - Someone could verify that? - Yeah, all the big winners. Well, we'll check it out. How did he die? Screaming. How can you refuse to submit my motion for retrial? This is not a decision I made lightly. Nevertheless, it's my call to make. I don't care how you made it. It was a bad call. - She was underage. - Look, the evidence is tainted. She had a fake I.D. They would argue that Bosler had no way of knowing that she'd picked him up and the sex was consensual. It is time to clean the plate. If Cynthia Delgado's back wasn't wet when she came here, would you have pressed for a retrial? Katy, you of all people know that that is not true. Look, you've had a heavy caseload. Why don't you take a break for a while? Walk away from this, all right? - Are you asking me? - No. I'm telling you. Take a break. Go smell the flowers. Can't remember the last time I had a home-cooked meal. - You eat out every night? - Me? Nah. I'll tell you why: you ever see somebody sitting in a restaurant alone? Everybody's starin' at him, feelin' sorry for him, looking at him like they're from Mars or something? Nah. Me, I just eat at home. Use a coaster, would you? Sure. Thanks. - Got to hand it to you. - You're a good cook, huh? Yeah, all I did was throw these things in the oven there. - This creamed corned is great. - Right out of a can. - This frozen? - No, it's out of a can. - It's out of a can. - Yeah. - It's canned creamed corn? - Yeah, that's what I said. It's out of a can. Do you want me to get the can for you? No, no. It's great. It beats frozen from anything. So how long were you married for? About three years. If it's not too personal, what happened? My wife committed suicide. And don't ask me why 'cause she didn't leave a note. Can I get some more of this creamed corn? Is there any left? Creamed corn. Yeah. Don't you think you've had enough? Okay. Why don't we just go back tomorrow and talk to him? Fine. Haven't seen you here before. What are you drinking? You want another one? Bored? I can do something about that. The view from my penthouse is to die for. Just looks like a couple of strands of hair to me. Okay. Have a look at this, lover boy. Notice any difference? No. Had me fooled, too, until I ran a check for DNA. Those others strands were a blend of human and synthetic. Your victim's hair was brown. Your killer was wearing a red wig. - It doesn't really narrow it down. - I do my best, Tom. I know, I know you do. What else you got? Got a positive on that thumbprint. It belonged to Dean Harvey. No others? Some partials. Couldn't come up with a match. But we did find traces of phenodril and belladonna in one of the glasses. What's that? Lethal poison, odorless and tasteless. That's why there was no sign of a struggle. Forensics? Yeah, they're here. Hold on. Tom. Hello. Yeah. Yeah, we'll be right there. Might have more hair for you. - Same MO? - Same brand, Hoffman. - Any info on the victim? - Yeah. The name is William Bosler. He was the loser Katy Wesson had on trial that time we saw her in court. I asked Dr. Riskin to come by and try and tell us what kind of a person we're looking for here. Doc, what kind of freak is this? Is this some hairdresser on crack or some stone-cold psycho? There are signs of obsessive psychopathic behavior, particularly in the shorning of the victim's hair. But your suspect is not crazy, at least not in the clinical sense. There is a method to the madness. You don't think we're dealing with a ritualistic killer, like Son of Sam or, what's that guy's name, Ramirez? No. The victims weren't picked at random. You must ask yourself, "What makes this person kill?" You need to discover the truth and a meaning of their victimization. You're telling us that our killer might be a victim? Yes, most probably someone who was abused as a child. That's where their rage is focused, and they try to take the power away from that person. In this case, it's like Delilah, who cut off Samson's hair, thinking he would lose his power. So our killer cuts off his or her victims' hair to render them powerless? Precisely. Could this haircutting have been part of the abuse they suffered as a child? Yes. It's as if they need to revisit the nightmare they once were a part of. Tell me again, why are we doing this? 'Cause it helps me think. This better work. Come on, man, you said you were a jock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go. - How's your back? - It's sore. - No excuses, though. - I'll take it easy. Let's go. We got a psychological profile of our killer, but still no suspect. There's gotta be a connection between the killer and the victims. Yeah. Somebody who knew them both. Somebody who had a grudge. - Katy Wesson. - Say what? Katy Wesson. She tried both rape cases, right? Yeah. - And she lost. - Let's go talk to Tanner about this. Let's finish our game first. One-zip. - You didn't make that. - Yes, I did. I didn't see you make it. You were too busy thinkin'. - All right. Let's go. - Okay. I know it sounds crazy, Chief, but I'm telling you, if you could have been in that courtroom and seen the look on her face and the way she looked at Bosler when that judge let him escape. I did a little digging, found out she had a fit when Dean Harvey was acquitted. The judge almost held her in contempt. So she's a sore loser. Go back. Check all the other cases she's lost. If you can come up with something resembling probable cause, maybe then I'll buy it. That's just it, Chief. These are the only two cases. Then you're crazy. This is pure speculation. We interviewed all the women who filed complaints against the victims. They're all clear. She's the only possible suspect we have. No, no, no. - Can I ask you a question, Chief? - Ask me. - You afraid to go after her? - There is nothing to go after her on. It's okay. I understand she's a very powerful woman. But what I don't understand is why cops can go after cops? We can go after our own, but we can't go after the DA's department. What, are they holier than thou? When was the last time somebody investigated the DA's department? So what do you want to do? We just wanna have a little peek at her personal file. - Forget it. You're not authorized. - Okay. How about if we just talk to her a little bit, you know? Just a little interview, nothing big. Yeah, it's no big deal. Talk, but with kid gloves, you understand? Yeah, I think I have a set in my car. Thanks, Chief. Don't worry, you can count on us. Right. That's what I'm afraid of. Kid gloves. - Ready? - Yeah. Well, well, well. - If it isn't beauty and the beast. - You must be the beast. - Is Ms. Wesson here? - She is busy. - What, are you two a pair? - What, are you two a pair? - What is it you want, Detective? - We'd like to ask her a few questions. - And I told you she's busy. - This won't take very long. - Fine. I'll answer them. - You speak for her all the time? Make sure nobody gets too close to her. Let me take care of this. Now, they have some questions for you, and I told them you were busy, but.. Is that an invitation? You were very rough on the police officers in the courtroom yesterday. Just imagine how bad the officer who forgot the warrant felt. I mean, if it were me, I would've gone out to the nearest bar and got drunk. I'm just curious, what did you do that night to take the edge off? You know what I mean? - That's really none of your business. - Is that exactly what she said? Detective, what exactly do you want here? William Bosler was found dead in his bed. So what does that have to do with us? I believe we were speaking with Ms. Wesson. Now, Ms. Wesson, where were you on Tuesday night? We were both here the entire evening. We never left the house. Why don't you let her answer for herself? Okay, let's see. I made dinner, we both watched TV. After the 11:00 news, I went to bed. I'm afraid my life is very boring. Is there anything else you would like to know? - No, thank you. - Yeah, yeah, there's just one more. - No, no, no, that's it. - No, I have one more question. - Listen, this is it. - Tom, hang on a second. I got one question here. Ms. Wesson, please indulge me. - How do you feel knowing he's dead? - I don't feel anything. I'm not sorry he's dead. He was a brutal, vile man. So he deserved to die? - I didn't say that, you did. - Okay, thank you. No, no, no. No, listen. I'm the primary in this case and it's over. I don't care. - You should trust me on this one. - I don't believe this. You two come into my house and you think I had something to do with this murder. We never said anything about murder, Ms. Wesson. And I had said that he died in his bed. And that's my exact... Get away from me, all right? Hey. You better tell her that she's gonna need to talk to somebody because we're gonna be back here looking for some more answers. What was that all about? I thought I was supposed to be the aggressive one. I guess you're rubbing off on me. Anyway, she isn't what she appears to be. The word on the street is that she's a regular down at a few clubs in SoHo. - Your source is sure about this? - I'll double-check. What do they want with my Katy? Chaney. - Is that what you call kid gloves? - What are you talking about, sir? You know what the hell I'm talking about, that thing yesterday afternoon with Katy Wesson. Ah, that's Lambeau. He just got a little excited. As soon as she calms down, she'll realize that we're just trying to do our job. Your job, if you want to keep it, is to go out there and find this perpetrator. - It's not to harass the DA. - Yes, sir. Sherlock, these just arrived for you. I never got flowers from my partner. - You send these? - Yeah, that's right. I thought you could use a little pick-me-up. "There's no excuse for the way I acted. How about meeting me after work for a drink?" Signed, Katy. What's up with that, Romeo? It's nothing, sir. I'll take care of it. You watch your ass. You don't see me shedding any tears over William Bosler. I think it's karma, fate, whatever you want to call it. The knife of justice cuts. You have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. Your eyes are like deep, blue reflecting pools. Makes me want to dive inside and find out all your deep, dark secrets. I have no secrets. What you see is what you get. Do you ever cry? No. No, not anymore. I've seen too much to be affected by anything. Your table is ready, sir. Come with me. What about your family? Ah, your mother and father. This is you? They're still alive? Your father... Your father died when you were a little girl. How? Sorry, it's a force of habit. Hunting accident? Someone shot him? Who shot him? Your mother? Thank you. Chocolate mousse. Good? Are you cold? I'm glad we did this. Good night. - What the hell were you thinking? - I don't know. - I don't know. You don't know. - What's your problem? Nothin' happened. I don't care if nothin' happened. Hey, you tell me you like this woman? Oh, what's not to like about her? She's successful. She's smart. Okay. Good-looking. Please tell me you found something out about her. - Something about her background. - I did. Her father was killed in a huntin' accident when she was a kid. - You believe her? - Why not? She got nothin' to hide. "'Tis all a checkerboard of nights and days "with men for pieces she plays. "Thither and hither she moves, mates and slays, "and one by one in the closets she lays." It's pretty, huh? - It's "Rubaiyat" by Omar Khayyam. - Yeah, that's nice. - You don't get it? - Get what? It's a game to her. She's playing you, partner. Come on, man. I tell you what: next time, I'll let her make the first move. Besides, after tonight, we'll have some new news. Some lady called me, said she got some information on the William Bosler murder, wants to meet me at a place called The Rage Club tonight. - I'll see you later. - Mm-mm. Yo, yo, yo. Forgettin' something here. I have $20 for the game. - I'll pay you later. - No, no, no pay later. You pay now. No, that's the rules. Come on, that's it. That's the way... - All right, I got it, I got it. - Thanks much. - I'll see you. - All right. ? Ecstasy is a state of mind ? On ecstasy I feel so fine ? Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy ? Ecstasy is a state of mind ? On ecstasy I feel so fine ? Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy ? Ecstasy is a state of mind ? On ecstasy I feel so fine ? Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy. You do like playing games. You have information on the Bosler murder? Why am I here? Why? ? It's something ? That you know in me ? I can't resist if you insist ? I'm so weak, you're so freak ? Let me be a slave ? to the rhythm ? I dedicate myself to you ? I know you're mine ? I know I'm yours ? Let's be together ? Let's touch each other ? Don't be afraid with me ? 'Cause I feel ecstasy ?

Don't be afraid with me ? 'Cause I feel ecstasy ? Ecstasy is a state of mind... - Must I do everything? - No. No, no. - I'll take care of him. - Like you have so far. The two of them lying in that bed, dirty. You're supposed to be looking out for her. Hi. It's Tom. I'm not here. Leave a message after the beep. Phenodril. I have a headache. Ah. I have to go. Now, that woman was some piece of work. You talk about playing games. "Pretty good movie, huh? You think she was the killer?" It was obvious. Sharon Stone was the killer in "Basic Instinct." No, no. No. She planted them. She knew she would get away with it. She was smarter than anyone. Why do you think they had-- they showed the ice pick under the bed at the end of the film? "That was the filmmaker playing a joke on the audience..." I don't know about that, but... Do you think she really loved him? Can I have a glass of water, please? What game are you playing with me, huh? Why the Phenodril in the bathroom? What's this? Why do you have the Phenodril in your bathroom? "Get out!" Why can't you just leave her alone? So how'd it happen? I went for the brakes, and there were none. Tell you what, lucky for me there was a stop sign at that intersection, not a green light. Otherwise, I wouldn't be sittin' here. There's a leak in the master cylinder. Should have got those brakes fixed a long time ago. Or someone cut your brake line. I'm serious. Listen to me. Didn't you say you bumped into Josh on the way out of the house? Nah, it was an accident. - It sure makes me wonder. - What? What was in that apple Eve gave to Adam? If you ask me, I think all that hot monkey love has addled your brain, you know, scrambled your vision. Well, if you think about it, she's the one who probably put him up to it. Why would she wanna get rid of me when we got something nice going here? Maybe because she's a stone-cold killer who knows you're on to her. - She's no longer a suspect. - You have no doubts. I have no doubt. What's your problem? I'm just trying to figure this out. Now, sex, that's the only thing you got goin' between you. No, no, no. We got something going here. - You got something going here. - Yeah, we got something. - Like what? Like what? - We got somethin'. Like what? Somethin'. Would you like to sit down? Thank you for coming over. I know how you feel because I know that I was a fool. I'm sorry for what I did, and I hope... Please forgive me. I've been thinking. I want you in my life. You are very, very important to me, to my... I have something. This is a... It's a key to my apartment. So, I... I don't want to go another day without us seeing each other. I got in touch with her mother. She's coming in. She's very concerned. She said her daughter hasn't returned her calls lately. So what? Are you okay? Fine. You don't look so okay. You want a beer? No, thanks. So what happened that you just got sucked back into it? You know, for a homicide detective, you're none too smart. You invite a murder suspect into your apartment without backup. She's got a key. She can come and go as she pleases. - A key? - Yeah. I take it back, you're not stupid. You're just insane. What is it, Tom, you just can't stay away from it? I don't wanna stay away from it. Later, sweets. Something just popped. Now, I know I got the minority opinion here, but I went with it anyway. Katy Wesson's father wasn't killed on a hunting accident. When you told me that story, I thought to myself, "Uh-uh. No way." "That dog don't hunt." How'd he die? They found him in a patch of dirt behind his house with a piece of tape over his mouth. Well, maybe the mother made up the hunting story to protect her. I don't think so. According to the detective in Queens who handled the case, the mother was the prime suspect from the get-go. But they couldn't get anything to stick. - I'd like to talk to this detective. - I already have. How well did he know the family? He says no one really knew them. Seems the father battered the mother, but she never bothered to press charges. Well, I guess one day she just had enough. - She still live in Queens? - Yeah, yeah, she is. I'm trying to get in touch with her right now. Has something happened to my Katy? No, no, there's no reason to be alarmed. Then why did you ask me to come down to the police station? We just wanna ask you a few questions, get a few things cleared up. What things? Ms. Wesson, can you tell us what happened to your daughter when she was a little girl? Just the facts surrounding your husband's death. Why should our family's personal life be of any interest to you? Your daughter's a suspect in a murder investigation. That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. My Katy is one of the city's top prosecutors. We understand that, ma'am. What my partner meant to say was that your daughter is on the long list of names that we have to talk to, people that knew or came in contact with the victim. We're not saying your daughter is a murderess. What matters is what she's done to overcome it. She's lucky she's even able to live a normal life, so don't you go casting aspersions on my daughter's character, calling her indecent when she's a decent, hardworking girl. How was your husband killed? Nobody knows what happened. Katy and her father, they were pretty close? She was his little sugar plum. Every night before she went to bed, he'd sing her a lullaby. Did your husband abuse your daughter? Shame on you. What the hell kind of question was that? The right one. Oh, man. What do you want to charge her with? Coming from a dysfunctional family, huh? What about you, Chaney? I haven't heard anything from you. What do you think? We keeping you up here? Come on. What do you think? I think it just doesn't feel right. Something smells funny. Something smells. You know what you smell? Bullshit 'cause you're up to your knees in it. What the hell are you doing here? Lieutenant, I can personally vouch for Detective Chaney. Excuse me. Excuse me, I wasn't asking you. I'm talking to you. Now, tell me, maybe I can help you. Is there something going on between you and this broad? No, sir. I'm just doing my job. Just so you understand, you're flushing your career down the toilet here. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't picked me up right then and brought me back here, Josh. Here, this will help. Just lie back. Okay, that'll be Katy. Hey. Come on in. No, no, she's fine. She's fine. It's just a migraine. She's had a rough day. Is that you, Katy? Come over here, dear. What happened, Mother? It was that dreadful Tom Chaney. I don't think you should see him any longer. He doesn't deserve you. He got me so upset that it caused this migraine. You don't understand what's going on. Tom and I have something very special. Katherine, haven't I always known what's best for you? I'm right about him. You'll see. Don't patronize me, mother. What were you doing seeing Tom behind my back anyway? I did no such thing. For your information, he called me and insisted that I come in. It wasn't the other way around. This doesn't make sense. Why would he insist on that? He thinks you're hiding something from him. He assured me you weren't a suspect. But he asked me some very disturbing questions about what happened when you were a child. - What did you tell them? - The truth, of course. But then they made those filthy accusations about you and your father. Katy, dear, please listen to me. This man is deceitful. He's using you and not worthy of your time or affections. I'm only saying this because I love you. Get rid of Tom Chaney before he drags you down. You betrayed me. I trusted you. Snooping around behind my back asking questions you had no business asking. I can explain. My partner just wanted to ask a few questions, clear a few things up, and take your name off a list. He doesn't like me. He's tried to come between us from the start. It's nothing personal. He was just doing his job. And you were doing yours? "You cut my heart in two" Come on in, Chaney. Close the door behind you. Don't bother sitting down. I just got off the phone from the DA's office. Yeah. Seems that Katy Wesson has filed a sexual harassment complaint against you. - What? - Oh, yeah, no mistake. She sent over a restraining order. There it is. You're not to come within 100 yards of her. If you do, Dahlgren will have you up in front of the police commission and have you dismissed and maybe me, too. - 100 yards, you understand? - What about the homicide investigation? Am I not getting through to you here? Dahlgren has taken a personal interest in this case. I can't help you anymore, and my hands are tied. Now, don't underestimate this guy. He'll take you down. He'll have you selling security systems in Jersey before you know what the fuck happened to you. Do you hear me? Now get out there, do your job, and stay away from that woman. Hey, Josh. Can I come in? Like I have a choice. Nice place. Mind if I look around? Knock yourself out. This is interesting. Did you do it? What is it you're really after, Detective? You know, you could tell a lot about an artist by his work. I didn't know you had such flair, Josh. What other talents are you hiding? So now you moonlight as an art critic? That's good 'cause that's just what the world needs. We all need something. I'll tell you what I need, Josh. - I need some answers. - No, I'll tell you what you need. You need a subpoena. And then maybe, if you're lucky, I'll give you some answers. Until then, visiting time is over. Detective. This is the answering machine for Katy Wesson. Look at these people, huh? This place makes me sick. I live just around the corner on Vista. Hey, who are you to ignore me? You wanna know what I think? I think it's a crock, that's what I think. Chaney, come on in. Close the door behind you. - You know Dave Dahlgren? - Yeah. Sit down, Detective. Hope this isn't about that rental car. Shut up, Chaney. Oh. Eh. - Is she? - No, otherwise I'd indict you ..for murder instead of assault with intent to kill. What? You think I did this? That's what she said, Tom, just before she lapsed into unconsciousness. - What? - She was afraid of you. Why do you think there was a restraining order? Hold it. Chaney, you don't have to say anything more until you talk to your lawyer, you understand? I don't need no goddamn lawyer. I didn't do anything. - I'll answer any question you got. - Sit down, Detective. These are very serious allegations. Sit down. Mr. Dahlgren here wants the investigation to be conducted by the Internal Affairs Division, am I right? I expect your complete cooperation. Detective Chaney, were you on duty last night? No, not officially. So you weren't on duty and Ms. Wesson was no longer under surveillance. So why were you tailing her? Personal reasons. How well did you know Ms. Wesson? I know her. Intimately? Detective, did you have sex with her? Yes. While she was still a suspect? Yes. You knew it was in violation of department policy? Yes. I was just trying to get close to her. It just happened. Well, it seems like you got a little too close. Yeah. I did not do this to her. Someone set me up. Who set you up, Detective? Why don't you ask my partner? Hey, Chaney. I'm sorry to hear about your suspension. Maybe if you were more of a team player instead of a hot dog, things would have worked out for you. I'm gonna miss you, man. Love you, asshole. What, you gonna kick my ass? Look at you. Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey, Tom, listen to me, man, this whole thing has gotten way out of hand. Hey, it's all right, man, you warned me about her, you told me she was hiding something, something in her past, something real bad. And the jerk that I am, I didn't see it. We all get screwed up sometimes. I gotta tell you, man. You are some fucking piece of work. You're smart, man, you're smart. You knew everything about her history. You knew you could do anything you wanted with it, and you used it to turn her against me, didn't you? Well, guess what, buddy, you did me a fucking favor. What the hell are you talking about? You have no idea who put that beating on her? Well, all I can say is whoever did it was lucky they didn't fucking kill her. Oh, Jesus, look at that piece of crap. Come on, buddy, let's go. Tom, come on. Let's go, get up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Tom, we've got places to go. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up in here. Come on, man. I knew I had it here somewhere. Ah, yes. I remember it now. Did her mother tell you what had happened? No. She was extremely upset and worried about what her husband would do to her if she told anyone. What exactly was her problem? It was obvious that she had been strangled. She was having trouble breathing. I had to make a cut in her trachea so she could take in air. I called an ambulance and got her into a small, private hospital immediately. The X-rays revealed her windpipe had been severely bruised, almost swollen shut completely, but there was no permanent damage to the larynx as far as I could make out. Yet months after her recovery, she was still so badly traumatized that she couldn't say a word. Did her mother tell you she was deaf? There was absolutely nothing the matter with that child's hearing. She was simply too afraid to speak. Now, how'd you come up with that? There was always something that bothered me. There was always a little niggling doubt, something I just wasn't sure. What? We've followed her out into the courthouse lobby. You called out her name. Ms. Wesson. And she turned around before he did. All those years and she didn't say a word, and no one was the wiser. Listen, Lambeau. No. Forget about it. Hang on. It's 911 from the office. I gotta go. I'll call you later. Oh, man, what did I do? Don't get too close, Detective, this one's a ripe one. Been dead for over 24 hours. - Mr. Kolb, what do you got there? - Hoffman, a name you can count on. Instead of getting poisoned, our victim got stabbed through the heart with them this time. Then he got his hair chopped. Could have a possible copycat. Well, maybe we got lucky, maybe the killer left us a clean set of prints. - Is that it? - Yeah, that's it. All right, I'm out of here. Same as the other two, except this guy was stabbed through the heart with a pair of scissors. - My question... - Tom, look out. It's Katy's interpreter. Hey, Lambeau. Looks like maybe you popped the right guy. We finally got a clean set of prints. Last pair of scissors, they belonged to Josh Kane. Check out his apartment. Lieutenant... I guess that about wraps it up, huh? She planted them. She knew she would get away with it. She was smarter than anyone. Why do you think they showed the ice pick under the bed at the end of the film? I'm surprised she didn't put a bow around it. What are you doing here, Chaney? You're still on suspension. She wanted you to find that. Set it up perfect just like in the movie. What movie? - Well, I got a date in court. - What are you talking about? Just answering the D.A.'s call. You know what the hell he's talking about? Ms. Wesson has agreed to drop all charges against you. - You're kidding? - No, I don't kid, Detective Chaney. They found Katy's purse in victim number three's apartment. Correct me if I'm wrong, but did she not identify me? Look, she was upset. You'd been harassing her. She knew you were following her that night. She was trying to get away from you at the club. It was dark. Her attacker came from behind. She just assumed it was you. Well, that was some assumption. "Kane Josh 121 Cardio St. Manhattan" "...Sister: Wesson Katherine" They were brother and sister. He is her half-brother. Spent most of his life in and out of foster homes. She set up her own brother. It was the only way to solve her problem, get herself cleared. Now, nobody suspects her. Except us. Tom, she's sick. What do we do now, Katy, now that we both know the truth? Did you like it? I can almost hear him calling out your name. Did you have long, beautiful hair when you were daddy's girl, daddy's little girl? Did you beg your brother for help when he touched you? Katy... Please, Katy. I know you can hear me, Katy. Please talk to me. Katy, please talk to me. No more lies. Was it your mother or was it Josh? Katy. What are you doing with that, Katy? Put it down. Katy, give me the gun. Katy. I know it was you, but it's okay. I know you killed your father, but that's okay. You need help, and I can help you. Please, give me the gun. I'm sorry. I love you. No! I love you. ? Do you remember when ? You smiled at me and then ? You said to me ? This love will never die? ? As long as you and I ? Can be free ? We have a real love ? Real love won't die ? Real love ? I'll be thinking ? I'll be thinking of you ? Real love ? Real love.
