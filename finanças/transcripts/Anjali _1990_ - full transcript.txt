Stop please! Please stop! Lift please! Car! Idiot! Stop! Wait, I'll charge Rs. 25. - Okay! Where to? Hinduja hospital. We have to pick our parents from home first. I won't go that way, move. It's an emergency! - I don't want to go. Stop! My father is an assistant commissioner. Mr. Chandra Shekhar, assistant commissioner of traffic. Aren't you ashamed of lying? Your registration number is 784, right? I'll complain against you. - Why didn't you tell me before? What happened to the commissioner's car? - Got stolen. Careful! Have a seat! Good morning sir! Good evening sir! So what do you want? A brother or a sister? Brother! No it would be my sister! Anjali! No Ashok! - No Anjali! No Ashok! - No Anjali! Papa you tell us. - Guess it'll be both, a brother and a sister. Oh no! Enough! I don't want twins. Three are enough. Arjun, Nothing will happen to mom! Nothing will happen. Will mom die? - Quiet! I want to see mom. This is a hospital, don't make noise. Or the doctor will operate on you. What happened doctor? - The mother is all right. And the baby? - I'll explain. Come with me. What happened? - Arjun what's wrong? What happened? - Be quiet! Is mom dead? - No! Why isn't papa coming out? - Quiet! Mom is dead, right? Nothing has happened to her. - She is dead! Papa! Papa! What happened? - Is mom dead? Is my mother dead? Answer me! - No my child! Take me to mom, please! Mom wants to know, if it's a boy or a girl. A girl! Anjali! I'd already decided on the name. Isn't it a nice name? Get her here, I want to see her. No! Anjali isn't around. - What? She was stillborn. Papa! "Something! I want." "Something!" "We want to sing, something."

You address us by names, aren't you ashamed? Wait! Catch him. Anu wait! Mom come! Don't spare her. Arjun, catch her. - Papa that way! That said. - Arjun, come with me. Anu stop, you may fall! - Help! Anu. - Is anybody out there? Help! - Anu stop, you may fall! Help! - Anu stop! Got you! - Got you! Anu what nonsense! You've become very naughty, you should be.. Excuse me! Are you new here? - Yes in flat 4B. You've taken the flat on rent, you haven't bought the building! Sorry sir! - Wonder where they come from! Made it a fish market! Shall I abuse this fatso? Quiet! - Shut up! Look, he's getting angry! Red faced like an ape. Will you hit us? - Let's scram! Take this upstairs. I'll be back soon. Where're you going? - I said I'm coming. I'll come too. He's coming! Rs.1.20. - For the carrot or the tomato? You heard me? Give. - What if I don't? Arjun, look behind! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Harder! - Vishnu Hit him more! Arjun! - Vishnu! Beat him! Beat him to pulp! What's going on? Fighting? - Fight? We're not fighting. We aren't fighting. Is anyone fighting here? No fights here! Come with me to the police station. For what crime? Under what section? Taking us without a reason is a crime? Do you have a warrant? My father is a criminal lawyer. Who is he? - My cousin. Isn't he my cousin? - Yes! Quiet! If anyone fights again... Then? Then? Warning for all of you! The house is new and so is the kitchen. Everyone has to adjust. No complaints about the food. Any complaints and there'd be no food. Mr. Engineer! Heard me? It's great, right Arjun? Yes it is, but the salt is less. - What? A bit less. So the food is not good? You say too. What's bad about the food? Why don't you say? No complains! What happened? Answer me. What happened Anu? What? The date? - Yes. What does that mean? September 18! On this day, god took away baby Anjali from us! It's her birthday today! Chitu! Don't you have any sense? - More than you! What was the need to mention Anjali? Why shouldn't I? I miss her! - You've made mother cry! So what, even I feel like crying! It's been 2 years now. Anu! Go away! Nobody even remembers! Don't touch me, or I'll cry. I'd like to introduce our new residents. Shekhar and Mrs. Chitra Shekhar. He's Arjun. - Arjun! Mr. Shekhar is a leading civil engineer. Arjun is our friend henceforth! And Mrs. Shekhar is the woman behind this successful man. Anu knows how to whistle. Mr. Vishwanath! - Hello! Mitali Vishwanath! - Hello! Mr. Murlidhar! - Hello! Mrs. Murlidhar! - Hello! Mr. R. Krishna! - Hello! Mrs. R. Krishna! - Hello! Mr. Krishnamurthy! - Hello! Annapurna Krishnamurthy! - Hello! We've formed this society to solve the resident's problems.

Before I count 5, the lift-man will come here. Lift-man get the kids here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! You're wanted upstairs. What's your problem? - They punctured my tire. Papa, I'm warning you. You'd be in trouble. What? - I'll tell everyone. What? - Mom asked me to puncture it. I warned you. Quiet! Rascals! Aren't you ashamed? Hear him! He says what he wants here. But at home, in mom's presence, he loses his voice. Stop giggling! Be quiet! Impudent kids, they expose everyone! They shouldn't be allowed to step out of the house. - Why? They scream and burst our eardrums! I got my son admitted to college due to my influence. But if they keep shouting, my son can never pass his exams! Your son doesn't study, he peeps inside uncle's house all the time. What? He gave me a letter to pass on to Gayatri. What is this Uma Shankar? - What? How dare your son did that? - Check with your daughter first! Don't talk about her! - Don't talk about my son! If he ever writes to my daughter again, I'll break his hands! As if your daughter is chaste! What will the society do, if we keep fighting? I'll smash your head! Keep quite! - I'll kill you! Don't interfere! - Impudent man! Please! Did you see? The result of your insolence! You created a war in five minutes! - You don't talk to us. Why? - Our parents have told us not to talk to you! Why? - Because you talk to the watchman's wife! Shut up you rascals! Hurry up! Where's papa? - He is inspecting up. Okay. - Yes. Papa! - Work faster than this, come on. Papa! - Come on, quickly quickly. Come here! Papa. - Give that container to Ganpat downstairs. Papa. What are you doing here Arjun? Teacher says the homework you did for me is wrong. You don't know modern maths. How could I build such a big building then? Your teacher doesn't know. - I told her the same too. But she asked me to leave the class. So what do I do? Come down and come to school with me. Or, I'll get in the lift and come up. You come up. Arjun was asked to leave the class today, mom. Shut up. Look, he's hitting me now. - Is this true? Do I ever lie? - Keep quiet! Why should I? Why didn't you come home from school? He was having fun with papa. Instigating mother? You! - Help! Come here Anu. Run! Run! Mummy's spy! What are you doing? Listen to me! Come inside! Don't shout! Is he mad? Mad girl, she doesn't recognize a mad person! Really dad! - Really? Suresh! - Please come inside. Come back! Don't shout! The old watchman of this colony. His child's death made him mad. He is harmless. Never troubles anyone. Let's go home! - Come back home Suresh! Suresh! Mad man! Why did you do that? Why did you hit Anu? She's innocent! Answer me Shekhar! Suresh come back! - Don't go there! Where are you going? Suresh! Let's go. - We'll play hide and seek! Sorry papa! I'll never call him mad again. Go to sleep. I'm not feeling sleepy! Shut your eyes, you'll fall asleep. Tell me a story. About the witch and the ghost! There's no such story. Arjun has one. Papa look, I have very good stories! Read it out papa. Science fiction? Yes! You hid it from me? Kept it under the pillow. - Read it quickly. Don't be scared! Should I proceed? Yes papa. - Read it fast. "At nights, it's the ghost's dancing." "Turn around and watch." "Turn and look." "Look suddenly, there are explosions everywhere." "At nights, it's the ghost's dancing." "Turn and look." "They both seem agitated of each other."

Shall I come there? You'll be beaten. Why? - Her father's here! When can we meet? What is she saying? Sunday. Your father? Is going for a movie. And where will we meet? In the moonlight. - On the terrace. Nobody lives in that flat? There's a man, but nobody's seen him. He never steps out. No, he comes out in the night. He never sleeps, you wait and see, he'll come today too. There he comes. He was in jail earlier? - Why? He's committed many murders! Has anyone seen him? - Forget it, let's go back home. He may kill us too. - You all are cowards! Not scared, but why mess with him? If you have the guts, knock at his door. - No. What if he kills us? Nobody has the guts. Well then, let's go. - Yes! No I'm scared. - Why are you scared? Speak slowly. C'mon. Let's go. We'll be trapped because of her. Don't make a noise. Who will go up? - Vishnu you go. Krishna you go too. - Okay. 1, 2, 3. Did you knock his door? Irk him and he'll kill you. Scoot! Papa! Papa! Come here! Where is papa? He's gone out. Hello ma'am! How are you? - Fine, sir has gone out. When? - Left in the morning. Had a meeting. Cancelled that too. Papa is such a bore! Did he say when he'll return? I don't know! There was a call and he left immediately. Tell him I came. - Yes. Come! Poor mummy! We can't go to the restaurant now. She'll have to cook for us. No problem Chitra. I'll help you. You took my name again! Come here! Anu, give me the lentils container. Where is it? I cannot see. Up there. - You be quiet. Anu dropped the jar. No food for her. Be quiet! Stay quiet! Did I add salt to it? No. - Yes. Why are you confusing me? - Papa's here! Hi Papa! - Hi Shekhar! Hi Shekhar! Why did you come late today? Where were you? I was at the site. Were you there since morning? Had a meeting with the client. Papa's lying. Don't interrupt. Were you there whole day? - Yes! Had a lot of work. I was busy. Why is papa lying so much? - Keep quiet and eat. There's a tussle between the contractor and the architect. The contractor says, he can't give more money. The budget's shot up. The architect refuses to work without the cash. And it's me who's trapped! The whole day was ruined! Mom is crying! - Be quiet! Arjun finish your food. Anu! Papa is a liar! - Will you be quiet? Do you know mom is crying? - I know. She has tears in her eyes. - Stay quiet! Understand? - Okay! Why did you lie? You were not at the site. We went there, mom was there with us. You lied, you were not there. You've made my mom cry! You've lied to us, Papa! You lied. Chitu! You trust me right? Actually we have to lie at times. Right! Especially with the kids around! Was it necessary to lie? What could I do? What is happening? Arjun, mom and dad have patched up. Come here. What is it to you? Arjun come here soon! Uncle, why don't you love aunt like your car? Love that witch? What? I was kidding. Krishna, your wife is calling you. Which wife? - Number 2. Uncle! What's this ruckus? Call me uncle again and I'll slap you. Uncle's wild. I love you! Look, he says 'I love you'! Uncle how are babies born? - What? Where are you going? Going out? - Quiet! What if mom finds out? You know papa is out. Why are you taking the money? Speak softly. - Take me along, please! No. Why not? - Kids can't go out tonight. I'm not a kid! Arjun! Arjun! "1991 will usher in."

Happy new year. Hi Chitu! Where are they? Arjun! Anu. What's wrong with you two? Why are you so quiet? First ask what's happened in your absence. What did you do? - He was roaming the streets with friends. You know how he came back? The police had caught them. Tell him! Why are you quiet? Speak up? Did you go out? I didn't. - You lied again? Arjun! What's the matter? What's it? Tell me the truth! You tell the truth first, you're lying! You told us you're going out, but didn't go anywhere. You were holding a woman's hand last night. I saw papa! I saw you papa! Chitu! Mom is not talking to papa since last night. Thanks to you! Who asked you to disclose it to mom? Gossip monger! They had a fight because of you! What are you'll doing? C'mon scram! Don't harass him! Go away from here! Calm down! Come home. Why are you doing this? Come! I can't sleep Arjun. Where are you lost? Divorce is very bad! What is divorce? Papa and mom will stay separate. My classmate's mom was divorced by his dad. Then? They both can never stay together. And we both? You'll be with mom and me with dad. And then, we'll never meet again! I want to cry! Shut up. Go to sleep. Papa? Will you divorce my mother, papa? Will you separate Arjun from mom? Arjun said he'll stay with you and I, with mom. And then, we'll never meet, no matter what. Is this true papa? Come here. This is wrong. We'll never separate! We'll always be together! So you won't divorce mom? Never, not even when I die. Kids come here, please. Swear upon them, that you'll forget that woman. That you'll break all ties with her. Chitu, don't start again. - Don't tell me it's a lie. This is your bank passbook. You give me Rs. 2000 every month, but you withdraw 3000. Where do you send it? For the last 2 years, you go to Bangalore every week. Your office says, there's no construction activity in Bangalore. Will you still deny? Chitu, your doubts are baseless. No! I don't want to hear anymore. I don't want to know... anything about her. Henceforth, I won't ask you anything. Anu and Arjun want their papa and I want my husband! Promise us you'll be there for us! Make a promise? Uncle is here. Why are you crowding here? - Is it wrong? What? - Nothing we were just freaking out. Move! Are you going inside? - Yes. Don't go in. - You'll get into trouble. Move. - We've said what we had to. But if you insist, you'll regret. - Move! Uma Shankar! Uma Shankar! - Uma Shankar! Uma Shankar! - Uma Shankar! Why are you shouting, Narayan Sharma? Narayan Sharma, why are you shouting? Uma Shankar I'm warning you! If your son meets my girl, I'll kill him! He will kill him! Your daughter holds his hand and runs to the terrace. Kill your daughter first! - Kill her first! Promise me that you'll never meet him again! Don't make such a promise! C'mon! She's trapped! You come here! Move! Stop looking at her and you promise too. That you'll never meet her again! Don't make such a promise! - Quiet! Promise me! Come inside. - Oh no. Can I switch on the light? - No. Don't make a noise. Arjun a knife! Must have killed everyone with this. A cigarette! Is this his daughter's photo? He has a child too? - It's her photo. Yes! What's this letter? Seems like a court's release order. - Read it. 'To the jailor of Shankarpur.' 'Reference: Release of Dennis Joseph.' Dennis Joseph. - His name is Dennis Joseph. 'Dear Sir, with reference to your recommendation' 'regarding Dennis Joseph's case,' 'who has completed his term.' What are you doing? - Leave me! Please don't take him! Don't hit me! What happened? - I won't go! Leave him! I beg of you! Don't take him away! - I'm not mad! Leave me! Where are you taking him? Leave me please. Please leave him. - Let me go. Listen to me! "There're two lovers, on the terrace." "These lovers meet discreetly." "Let's watch a movie for free." "Let's watch the show." "Talking." "There're two lovers, on the terrace." "These lovers meet discreetly." "They're so engrossed, that they don't care about the world." "They're so engrossed, that they don't care about the world." "Throws it, or picks it up, what do we care?" "Throws it, or picks it up, what do we care?" "Let them have fun, let them do what they want." "Why do we bother?" "Let the hearts meet. Let's go." "There're two lovers, on the terrace." "These lovers meet discreetly." "Let's watch a movie for free." "Let's watch the show." "There're two lovers, on the terrace." "These lovers meet discreetly." "Stop! Don't move!" "When I say something, you listen to that." "When I show something, you look at that." "Don't stop the game." "Let go of the hand and go from here." "Let go of the hand and go from here." "Stop this show." "Stop this show." "Before you get caught, hide." "That's the signal for danger." "There're two lovers on the terrace." "These lovers meet discreetly." "Let's watch a movie for free." "Let's watch the show." "Missing." Please stop the bus! Arjun! Anu! Are we going out mom? Say something mom! Are we going to grandpa's house? And papa? Mom, why aren't you packing papa's clothes? Isn't papa coming with us? Won't papa come? Please say something! - Speak again and I'll slap you. Chitu! Chitra! Chitra! Stop Chitra! Chitu stop! Please listen to me. Please listen to me. Get aside! - Listen to me. We told you not to create a racket in the building! Go mind your business! Chitra, come back. - I won't! Please listen to me! I don't want to hear anything! Just a minute, - No, Shekhar! You've misunderstood me! Don't try to explain. - I'll tell you the truth! I've understood and seen everything! You don't need me but her! I'm leaving with my kids! Chitra! - Move Shekhar! Chitra! Chitra Please! Look Chitra! Come home. I'll tell you everything. I won't go there again! That's not it! Isn't there another woman in your life? Answer me, Shekhar? No! Tell me here! Just say yes or no? Yes there is! But she's not a woman. She's a child! Your child! Anjali! Who Anjali? Our Anjali? No! - This is true! She is alive! Anjali! Where is she? I don't believe! If she's alive, where is she? Answer me! Tell me. She is very sick. - I don't believe you! Tell me the truth. Take me to Anjali! Take me to Anjali! Where is Anjali? You won't be able to bear! - No! I want to meet Anjali, take me to her! Take me to my child please! Anjali! Mother! Mother! Anjali's mother! Anjali suffered brain damage, at birth. Why did you tell me Anjali was dead? Patience Chitra! - To hell with patience! Why was I told Anjali was dead? Answer me please. How did this happen? What happened to her doctor? At birth, Anjali was normal, but her brain wasn't functioning. What then? - She didn't cry at birth. She was on respirator for 48 hours. We didn't hope that she'll survive for more than 4 days. She was born of a complicated Caesarean. You bled a lot. You were very weak. Anjali could have died any time. Had you been told about her birth and then about her death you wouldn't have been able to bear that! So, Shekhar told us to lie. Hence, we hid the truth from you. It was for your good! Nobody can say how Anjali, who the doctors thought would die, is still alive! It's a medical miracle! Earlier, she was in the hospital, but for the past 6 months, Dr. Sheila has kept her here. Nobody knows how Anjali is alive till now! Call it god's miracle. But the truth is that Anjali is alive because of her dad! In the past 2 years, he's been spending 5 hours with her daily. Anjali does not owe her life to medical science. It's a result of a father's dedication and faith! It is Mr. Shekhar who's kept Anjali alive till now! His dedication and perseverance has defeated death too! Where did you go? What happened Chitu? Get her home. It's not Anjali's fault. - Yes! Rs. 25! She's that girl. - Where is she? Who's she? What's up? Is she mad? - Speak softly. Where was she till now? - Hey, have you seen her? Poor mad girl! - Will they keep her here? She's mad. - She looks absolutely mad. Don't bother about them. They never understand anyone's grief. Anju! - Arjun! Anu, Anjali is your sister! She is not my sister! She's Anjali baby! She's not Anjali! She's your sister! - No! She is not Anjali baby! I don't want this sister! Anu open the door! Papa she is not nice. I don't want her, throw her away! Don't want her. Don't want her. Don't want her. Don't want her. Arjun! Is your sister mad? Is she half mad or full mad? Anjali my child, can I go to office? Say yes. Yes! I shouldn't go? I'll have lunch with my daughter! Can I go to office? Say yes. - Yes! Will Anjali come to me? Trust yourself. Anjali, mother! Mother! Say mother! Don't run away from me! Look at me just once! Only once Anjali! Anjali! Look here. Look here child, mother! Anjali, why are you paying for my bad deeds? Sorry! Sorry child! Please! Finished praying? Good night Anu! Arjun what did you ask from god? What did you say? It would be nice if Anjali baby dies! It would be really nice if this happens! Oh god! Today is Sunday! "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "The breeze walks with us, we rule the skies." "Nobody can stop us." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "The sun is soothing for us, day is as calm as night." "The sun is soothing for us, day is as calm as night." "Don't try to separate us. We have to live with each other." "Don't try to separate us. We have to live with each other." "We're the waves of an ocean. We'd flow the way we want." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "The breeze walks with us, we rule the skies." "Nobody can stop us." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "We'll move ahead, no matter what people say." "We'll move ahead, no matter what people say." "We'll sing and play, like others have never done before." "We'll sing and play, like others have never done before." "We're like the clouds, who'll never bow in front of anyone." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." "The breeze walks with us. We rule the skies." "Nobody can stop us." "The sky is our path." "The clouds are our companions." I'm jealous of you! Why? Because Anjali is with you these days, not with me. That's not true! She's always with her father. He takes care of her every need. You don't like it? - That's not it. But I'm a mother! She goes to Anu and Arjun, never to me. It'll be fine gradually! She recognizes her father and so, goes to him She's stayed amidst kids here, so goes to the kids. In a few days, she'll start coming to you too. Really? - Sure! I saw many children at Dr. Sheila's. Small and innocent like Anjali! They're all sick, trapped in their underdeveloped minds. I feel sorry for them! What is their fault? Why? Shekhar, will they be like this all their life? - Yes! Isn't there any cure for them? Everyone does as much as possible. Why has god made them like that? How would I know? But this is not fair! These kids haven't committed any sin! This is no justice to them! We were going home, why have you come here? I'm expecting a consignment. I'll check on that. Come soon. She may cry without you. Papa! I'll be right back! Mistry! Yes sir! Has the consignment arrived from Delhi? Yes sir! Get the stock book. - Yes. We'll work on the first floor from tomorrow. Fine, as soon as the workers.. Who are they? - I don't know. Who are you? Why are you going up? No Dharma! No Dharma! No Dharma! I told you not to do it! I told you not to interfere in my work. Rascals keep on doing it! Die. Die rascal! That's okay. - Sir! Please sit down. I'm hearing. What happened? What? No that's okay, no problem. No sir! I can't do anything about that. I'll talk to the commissioner. Reach there by 10 tomorrow. Sir, Shivraj's case is not suicide.. Sir is here. - Good morning sir! Get Shivraj's PF and gratuity file to my cabin in 5 minutes. Yes sir! Give the files. One minute sir! Inspector Shivraj's death case.. Yes! One minute. Was Shivraj in uniform? - No sir! You be quiet! No sir! Will you listen to me? Where are the files? - Getting it! Quick. Will you listen to me? - Look sir. One of our colleague's dead, so don't harass me. Shivraj didn't commit suicide! He was pushed from my building, in front of me. Who pushed him? - I don't know. But that man's name is Dharma. Shivraj had Dharma's file. Can you give a written statement? - Sure! Will you attend the court hearing? Yes! Bye! - Bye! See you tomorrow. Today, in the sports class, when I fell down.. What is it? Arjun where are you going? Move! Leave her! What are you doing? - Leave! Anu, take Anju and go! Anu! Anu! Anu! What's this? Hitting a small child? She's not a child, she's mad! Throw her out! - Shut up! Don't ever touch her! Anjali! Chitra come out. Look what your son has done to mine! Your kids are hooligans! They've thrashed our kids and wounded them! Look, he's still bleeding. Anu, go get Arjun! You don't know how to take care of them! Ask them what they did? - Speak and I'll slap you! Go get Arjun! Are all your children mad? Let's go. - We'll have to tell our kids not to play with them. Is this true Arjun? Yes mom! How did this happen? Who has hit you? You're bleeding? - They hit him! You didn't ask them what they did! They'd tied empty cans on Anjali's feet. That's why brother went to hit them. But they all beat him. Poor Arjun! I'm so scared Shekhar! What will happen to our kids? Anu and Arjun run away from Anjali. Anjali doesn't even come to me! What should I do? Everything will be fine! And what if it doesn't? Trust me! Really? I mean it. Hey. - Come. Once more. Once more. Come. What are you doing? She is my sister! Anjali! Who tied those cans on her feet? Tie them now if you have the guts. How has she harmed you? You think she's mad? If your sibling was like this, would you do the same? Call me Anil. - Ani. Anil! - Ani. Say Anil! Ani! That'll do. A... Anil. "Hurry up. We've to go on a magic journey." "A long magic journey." "Hurry up. We've to go on a magic journey." "A long magic journey."

I'll cut you up! Look at my hand. I committed my first murder when I was 15. I tortured that man before killing him. I've committed 21 murders till date. Not a single one has been proven. You'll die. Withdraw your police complaint. What if I don't? Are you crazy? You are an educated man! Give him sense. I don't want to commit another murder. Got it? Why do you want to die at my hands? You have a family, a wife and three kids. Why do you want them to die? Go, withdraw your complaint. All arrangements have been made in the commissioner's office. Go. Where's Anjali? We don't know. I don't know too. Anjali! Did you see my little girl? She was around. Anjali! Anjali! Watchman! Did my daughter come this way? - No. Anjali! She was alone downstairs. For god's sake, don't touch my daughter again. People like you can't be trusted! Anjali leave him! - Shall I drop her? Don't hit her! Hands off her! Sorry! But please don't hit her! My friend Uma Shankar, I didn't expect this from our kids! Narayan Sharma, our kids have left us alone! Uma Shankar, I'm with you. Don't worry! Let them be happy! Anjali! Don't let her come here! Go, don't come to me! Torture me more! What have I done? I've forgotten my husband for your sake! I've forgotten Anu and Arjun too! Why can't you understand? That man is a killer! You will go to him, but you won't come to me! How have I sinned? Why don't you come to me? Your mother longs to love you! Anjali, just once say mother! Anjali! Mother! Please! Say mother! One more. Hit me more! At least you're touching me! I'm your mother! When will you recognize me? Anjali, Anjali don't cry! Anjali! Don't cry dear! Don't cry dear! I won't be able to bear! Please don't cry! Anjali! Hit me. Anjali! Anjali! There's a society meeting today. Why? What for? Anjali's parents have been called. Chitra told me our attendance was important. Please sit. What happened sir? We had to talk, hence this emergency meeting. Sir our kids are alone at home. And I've a lot of work. Come to the point. - I am. You said you have three kids. Isn't Anjali your third child? Yes. - Actually.. What is it? - Everyone thinks that.. What? That the children of the building are subjected to bad influence. Bad influence? Of what? Our committee has decided that you leave this building, or.. - Or? Or you send Anjali to a mental hospital and you stay here. Don't speak against Anjali! Shekhar, don't get angry. - Who are you to order me? There are 100 families living in this colony. So? - If a deranged child is kept amidst them then.. Don't you.. Shekhar please! There are small children around. If a mad girl is amongst them, it could be a negative influence. Go and do your work. Please don't! Our kids have been talking like Anjali. They're influenced by your daughter. We must take an action! - Shut up! Anjali doesn't know what's right or wrong. She can be dangerous! - This is utter rubbish! Shekhar please! We understand your problem, but you should understand ours. The government has made a separate place for such people. Why don't you leave her there? Anjali won't go anywhere. Do what you want! Mrs. Shekhar! Men get angry fast, but you're a mother too. You give it a proper thought. You see, a mentally retarded.. One more word and.. Don't interfere! - Enough! A murderer can live here. Someone who's spent 5 years in jail can live here. The one who hits his wife after he's drunk can stay. This chaste woman too, who goes out with every man other than her husband! They all can live here, but an innocent kid cannot! Why? If anyone utters a word against Anjali.. Papa! - Yes! Papa Anjali is bad, right? Anjali doesn't even go out. If she goes out, everyone harasses her! Leave her back at the hospital, papa. I don't want Anjali! She is your sister! But, why was she born as my sister? She could be somebody else's sister! She could've been born elsewhere. Why is she my sister? There's a reason for it. - What is it? Before Anjali was born, up in the heaven the divine beings asked god, in whose house the next child will go. God said that, this girl... was his favourite child. But... unlike other children, she cannot play and run. Cannot talk properly. She has to be sent to a good house, where she gets a good mother. Where she gets a brother like Arjun and an elder sister like Anu. That's why, god sent Anjali to us. Anjali is a boon to us! She is here to be loved! To be loved till the very end! Anjali! I'm sorry! I didn't know! You're my sister! My good sister! You know, god sent you here for us. You'll love me, right? Love! Your elder sister! Anjali, please forgive me! You've forgiven me, right? Haven't you? Henceforth, you are my dear Anjali! "Anjali, my dear Anjali." "The apple of my eye, Anjali." "Your body is fragile, your eyes are bright as stars." "Your body is fragile, your eyes are bright as stars." "You take slow steps, you stammer when you talk." "You're delicate as a flower, don't wilt away." "We're scared, we may cast an evil eye upon you." "Anjali, my dear Anjali." "Anjali, our very own Anjali." "Anjali, my dear Anjali." "Anjali, our very own Anjali." "God has made you precious like the sun and the moon." "The clouds have showered their fragrance on you." "You run like the child of a deer." "We run behind you and you keep running ahead." "Your laughter sounds like the tinkle of bells." "You're the prettiest amongst everyone." "You look like a fairy amongst all of us." "Anjali, my dear Anjali." "Anjali, our very own Anjali." "Where have you learnt to talk with your eyes?" "We shall never separate, we will all live together." "You're tender as a bud, you bloom like the flowers." "You're so sweet, you flit around like a butterfly." "You're sweeter than sugar, you're different from the rest." "We shall walk along with you, every step that you take." "Go ahead and walk, don't be afraid of anyone." "Anjali, my dear Anjali" "Anjali, our very own Anjali." "Your body is fragile, your eyes are bright as stars." "Your body is fragile, your eyes are bright as stars." "You take slow steps, you stammer when you talk." "You're delicate as a flower, don't wilt away." "We're scared, we may cast an evil eye upon you." "Anjali, our own Anjali." "Anjali, our own Anjali." "Anjali, our own Anjali." "Anjali, our own Anjali." You have to identify the killer amongst these guys. Don't worry, you can see them, but they can't. He's the one. The three of them look so good sleeping together! Are you happy now? Happy? Yes! But.. - But what? When will she call me mother? Will she? Sure! Papa! Something's wrong with our Anjali, papa! Papa do something soon, please! Arjun, what did you ask god for? Please tell me, what did you ask god for? I prayed that our Anjali should be all right. I prayed the same. But, we had prayed earlier that she should die. Will that happen? Anjali will not die! You know your child's brain is damaged. And so, any sickness can be fatal for her. She had a breathing problem. Hence we did an operation and gave her artificial respiration. Let's wait and watch. Doctor my child! The surgeon says... she's fine now. You can even take her home. But, we can't say how long she'll be able to battle this. What do you mean? She's slipping away from us gradually. My Anjali is back! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Hello! Yes sir! We've brought Anjali back from the hospital. Yes. Yes. Yes. Papa! The Assistant Commissioner was on line. A man called Dharma is out on bail. He said to call him, if you need police protection. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! You called me mother today! Mother! Why didn't you say it before? You say it now, when you have to leave! Will you test my love? Mother! What will I do without you? I'll go mad! Mother! Mother! Nothing will happen to you! Mother! Papa, will Anjali die? What did the doctor say? - Who told you? Answer me papa. Will Anjali die? Arjun! Engineer, your son is with me, come down to fetch him! Come down. Papa! Leave me! Leave me! Help! Call the cops soon. Where are you going kids? Don't go out! No! Leave me! Papa! No! Anjali! Open your eyes Anjali! Open your eyes and look out. Please! Wake up Anjali! Arjun! Anjali isn't getting up, she's acting pricey! You wake her up. Come. Anjali! Wake up! She isn't talking, nor opening her eyes. Not talking? I'll go call mom. Mom! Anjali! Anjali look, mom has come! Anjali talk to mom. Anjali! Papa! Papa! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! What happened? - Anjali is not waking up! Papa! Anjali look, papa is here! Your dear papa! Ask Anjali to wake up, please! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! Anjali, I won't let you die! Vishnu, Krishna, Vinita, Preeti! Come up soon! Shekhar! - Anjali! Anjali! Anjali look who's here, wake up! See! See! Anjali see! Look Gopal is here, see! See! Look Sanjay is here. Vinita has come to meet you! Wake up Anjali! Look they've all come to meet you, wake up! Wake up Anjali! Open your eyes! Wake up Anjali! Open your eyes! Papa please wake her up! Wake her up, please papa! Wake her up, papa! Come on, wake her up! Papa, she listens to you! Mom, Anjali is not getting up, wake her up please! Mom, Anjali is not getting up, wake her up please! Mom, Anjali is not getting up, wake her up please! Arjun we will play with Anjali, wake her up! Arjun we will play with Anjali, wake her up! Someone ask Anjali to get up! Anjali please get up! Anjali please get up! Get up! "Anjali! My dear Anjali." "The apple of my eye, Anjali." "Anjali!"
