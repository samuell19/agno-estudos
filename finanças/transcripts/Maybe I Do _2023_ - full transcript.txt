Marriage. Yeah, I've been a happily married man for a long time. Mostly. And who you are is what you've mostly been, right? I mean, you've been something all your life, but you wake up one day and you realize more life has gone by than you've got left. So, maybe you think about the things you haven't done. Or who you've never been. Or what you may have missed along the way. And on that day, the last thing you want to be is who you mostly were. And you know what? That's a mistake. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know you. I know this certainly isn't my place, but you just seem very distressed. I'm at the movies by myself. Are you at the movies by yourself? Yes. You're not distressed? Oh, no. I'm... Real distressed. Sam. Grace. No matter where you go, there's a surprise. I'm naked under this. I'll take that into consideration. You haven't made love to me. Yeah, I understand I haven't done that. Hmm? Hmm, what do you think? I think when that robe comes off... - Yeah? - It's gonna be a whole lot of work. Get on me right now! I would... Monica, I would. I would do that, but we're in a very precarious world situation right now. And you're pressuring me with your availability. Come on, Howie. Do what you do. Come on. Play my body like it's a violin and you're a clarinet player who doesn't know how to play a violin! Nobody knows how to play that thing. Look, relationships go through this. You know, at some point, one person just wishes there was a button they could push that would make the other person go somewhere else for a while. Cease to exist? No. That person still exists. Oh. We came to this amazing hotel! There's no conversation because I'm not sure what there is to say anymore. What? Stop! How many good years do you think we have left? How many? Twenty? - Maybe? - Yeah. I can remember what I was doing 20 years ago like it was last Thursday. Now, if that's what we have left from last Thursday until now... Then we have to have fun! Then the only real conversation worth having would be the one that starts, "hey, if that's what we got left, are we living our best lives?" And also, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? - I'm underdressed for this. - Yeah. Because... the only thing I'm sure of is that I could be asking these same questions at home. With my wife. They're really doing this? She's throwing it to Michelle. Nobody else wants it. Michelle catches the flowers. You get married next. Have babies, same time as us. They grow up together. Best friends, same as them. Your life's all set. You didn't know? I didn't know. Don't mess up my wedding, man. Oh, man. - Okay. - Forget it. Why? Because you seem respectable to me. So, I ask, what's the matter, buddy? You're heading home to meatloaf. And you notice one of our exotic pixies outside, bathing in the soft, purple glow of the neon sign. And you think, "wait." "I believe she just looked at me with interest." Now, let me bust that up for you right now. As soon as you get her out of that neon glow... Jesus! I... I don't want to do this anymore. Okay. Okay. Wait a second. A person like you shouldn't take a person like me to a motel. I was enjoying talking to you and I just wanted to talk more. And it had the advantage of being a place nobody we know could possibly recognize us. And it was the only place open. Well, this is open. I couldn't take you here. Wait a minute. Okay. How old are you? Why does that matter? How old are you? Oh, I'm... I'm sixty-flaggh years old. Well, then, see? We're exactly the same age. Hey, am I just... I don't know. Am I just kind of naturally charmed because neither one of us have ever done anything like this before? Or... or... Have you perfected this routine and I'm just tonight's idiot dupe? Look at me. Yeah, I know. Me too, me too. I would never do anything like this. It's not even a possibility for me. Well, what's held you back? Because you're a good person? 'Cause I'd get caught. - Thank you. - Oh! Oh. But... thanks. But, if you're a good person, and you're married, and you're lonely... Don't two good people who have been on this earth for sixty-flaggh years... - Oh, at least. - Deserve happiness once? Well... As long as you're sure. Is there... Is there a Bible in the room? I'm unfamiliar with the amenities here. I really can't do this if there's a Bible in the room. Or a ring on my finger. I'll be, uh... Oh. Um... let me just see. Yeah. Look at you. Oh! - Holy Bible, right there. - There you go. Just... yeah. Holy Bible. I always knew I'd end up like this. Hi. Oh. I gave the Bible to Rosa from Paraguay, who understood immediately why a person would take the Bible out of the room. And she... she gave me soap. And she knew just enough English to tell me that I'd go straight to hell. - Listen to me. Listen. - Okay. A lifetime of decent behavior while other people were having more fun than us and ending up here together because we're lonely couldn't possibly get us into hell. Are you sure? Because it's a big deal. I'm sure. - You are? - Yes. - Wanna watch TV? - Oh, yes. Okay. Oh, there. It's right here. There. Do you wanna change the channel? No. That's how it's done? Well, those are professionals. - Do you like that? - No, I don't. - I don't. - Because... Whew! Wha... I mean, how do I even possibly belong in hell? I don't even know what was, like, happening with those people. What? You're adorable. Has anyone ever told you that? You wanna take a walk? Yeah! Howard, we are going on four months. This is just not the way you do this after four months. What do you think is right? Feelings? You wanna talk about your feelings? - No, that window closed. - When? As soon as I said it, I knew I wasn't gonna do it. Well, this wasn't about feelings anyway. You wanna know what this was about? - No. - This is about leaving the lives we have to spend time in the lives we deserve. Like an elegant hotel. Dinner with the right wine. Room service dessert that you can't make at home, huh? And what about the boom-boom? Oh, I want to be wanted in these surroundings. I want adventure. - Those are my feelings. - Yeah. There's one feeling that I have. You are some kind of woman. Oh, well... Thank you for that. How come? This is... The first time I've done something like this. And it's incredible to me that you've been able to turn a one-night stand into something that's taken four months to get out of. It was the bridal bouquet, Allen. And she threw it to me. Michelle... I was gonna jump in the air like it was swan lake. And I was coming down with those flowers. And you were gonna kiss me. And I was gonna kiss you. But the kind of kiss that let you know you'd be loved for the rest of your life. And your whole head was gonna go, "whoa!" And hold onto me way longer than appropriate at somebody else's wedding. And me and my best friend in the white dress could keep thinking our beautiful thoughts about our children growing up and being best friends. Our kids. Who we're never gonna have now because I'm not gonna let you touch me anymore. I want a more elegant exit. I want lies that you enjoyed your time in this place because of me. Okay. I am... grateful that you would think that I know how to be more sophisticated in this awkward moment. And I hope that you will not be so terribly angry that I'm not. Oh, but I am terribly angry. No reason for me to be here if you're angry. Not the kind of anger that rises up quickly and then goes away. That's anger for other people. Okay. What kind of anger do you have? Well, the more I look at you, it's a... quiet, sustaining anger that consumes me on a cellular level, and motivates me to start my new project. Oh, well, okay. Good. Uh, surely that has nothing to do with me. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go right out this door. I mean, you find it so amusing, this idea of pushing a button and then something just suddenly doesn't exist. Well, this existed. I exist. And you hurt me. I don't think I hurt you. Well, I'm gonna make it like you hurt me. So you walk out that door, I'm gonna hurt you back. I really don't think I hurt you. I'm gonna figure out how to kill you and get away with it. - Really? - Yeah, really. Because, while I've never done anything like that, and I'm smart, I think I can get away with it. Then does it matter if I stay or go? Oh, you are free to leave. Just understand that if you never wanna see me again, then you better make sure that you never see me again. Because if you do, then that's the day I'm gonna push that button... And you will cease to exist. I think that's fair. I always knew my life would be a collection of hideous moments ever since my mother told me I would never be a ballerina. Which was difficult for both of us, but I knew she was right. Do you want me to help you? You don't touch me. I accept that when god made me he did not dip into his reservoir of physical grace. So, I've always tried to make up for that with quirk! Which has somehow saved me from horrible moments of public shame until tonight. You did it, Allen. You are responsible for the most humiliating moment of my life. All this time, I was sure it would be me, but no. It was you. I don't even want to be in the same room with you where there's a bed. I'll tell you what else god did. He put night between the days so tomorrow could be a new one. So, all you have to do is accept my very sincere apology, and then this day can be over. And we can go to sleep. And so can the people in the surrounding apartments. Oh, am I being a little loud? Yes, you are, darling. I'm sorry! We're having a fight here. It was a reflex action. I saw the flowers. I reached out and I grabbed them. You climbed on a table, and threw yourself across the room. It was the most awful moment in the whole history of women being stuck with you idiots. Because I caught the bridal bouquet? No! Because you knew it meant something to me, and you left it in the street. You bastard. Well, this is nice. Could we get killed out here? It's okay. Seriously, do you think this could be a mistake? No, this is wonderful. I'll tell you what's a mistake. Everything I've ever done. You know how many girlfriends I took for a walk in high school? No. One. One girlfriend. - Oh? - Martha. She had a pink angora sweater. Which was the end of me. The leaves would blow off the trees and stick to it. And one time, she let me pull them off. Oh, yeah. We're diabolical like that. - That got me through winter... - Uh-huh. When I asked her to go sledding with me but I didn't bring my sled. So there was only one sled. So we had to lie on top of each other. Oh! Yeah. You guys are less clever. But, you know, we appreciate it when you include us in your plans. We were soaked from the snow. - Uh-huh. - We went back to her house. And she took off all her clothes. Right in front of me. And there she was, a naked girl. Smiling at me. Like I would know what to do with a naked girl. Did you? Is there something wrong with me? Because, in this time we're spending together, that's all you really need to figure out, right? So, is there something wrong with me? Are you holding out for a ballerina? You've always been a ballerina to me. Oh, boy. If we weren't having this argument right now, I'd be kissing everything you got. Here, you can have two. Don't you think our relationship works? Why would we change something that works? Less people are getting married, you know. What if they're onto something? I have a different thing. Okay. What do you got? I've got, this thing works because I thought it was going somewhere. Now that I know you think we've arrived at where we're going, it's gonna start not working so good. I love what we are. I'm happy with what we are together. Is that no good? You decide what I am to you. I love you right now. And now. You don't even get to say that anymore. How do you know you're not gonna meet someone better? I'm telling you I'll stop looking forever. How do you know that now? Are you a scared man? No. Because I don't want a scared man. You're just lucky what you did tonight doesn't stop me from knowing who you really are. I am lucky, but... I don't get to touch you anymore. Is that all you want? Here. This is my heart. This is my mind. All this can be yours if you call within the next 24 hours. Operators are standing by. You've got one day to tell me we're on the road to somewhere. Not that we're here and this is it. Because this is not it. Anything besides a "yes" is a "no." So, Martha and I had more romantic evenings, and what was awkward became... Well... I became proficient. I just thought, what good is it having this skill but Martha's going to be the only one who knows it. I just wanted to show someone else what I could do. And word would get around the halls, and everyone would know what Martha and I had. That's... that's all I wanted. - That was my plan. - Yeah? What do you think? I don't know. I mean, how did it work out for you? I took another girl to bed. Which was easy, because I belonged to somebody else. And you got caught. Martha walked in on us. I, um... I looked up at her and I said, "hi. I'm doing this for us." I never saw such a look of complete disappointment. Except on my wife's face all the time. Martha never talked to me again. But you want to know what? When I was with the other girl, in my head, it was always Martha anyway. You never heard from her again? One time. I got a letter with no return address. It said, "Sam, I'm married now and I love my husband." "But when I love him the most, he reminds me of you." Oh. That's devastating. Oh! I was thrilled. Because, as hard as I try, I can't satisfy my wife. But here, without trying, without even being there, someone was thinking nice things about me. I think nice things about you, Sam. You know, no matter what tricks you picked up in high school, I don't know how I could have had a better time than tonight. - Turn around. - Turn around? Can you have my car brought up, please? Thank you. Our doorman will be happy to assist you, ma'am. Ma'am? Ooh. Look at you. Aren't you lovely? And this hair, oh! Good for you. Look at me. Come on, you looked at me before. Look at me now. You will get here. It happens like that. The way we were, huh? So, you wanna split some pie and ice cream with me or what? No, thanks. Um... Cup of coffee would be great, thank you. I'll never have that moment again. Yeah. Not our world anymore. How was your card game? I left before I got killed. Oh. Well, I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry too, grace. Well... What, are you working on that thing? Mm-hmm. Yeah. How long you been working on that thing? Quite some time now, yeah. What is that thing? Are you trying to have a conversation with me? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sitting here and these words are coming out. Mm-hmm. Hmm? Wait. What are you doing? - Why are you following me? - I wanna see. You wanna see? What do you wanna see? See me get shot? I would want to be there for that, yeah. Ooh... Oh! Oh! Hey, slugger. Look at you, protecting mom. Everything you do gives me a heart attack. What happened? Hmm? What? Is... What happened, huh? No. Is there a problem with you and Allen? Oh, honey. Well, you know, we just have to decide whether we get married or break up. Honey! You can't think about spending your life with someone or never seeing them again at the same time. Well, sure you can. Those are the choices. That make sense to you? What? Well, it doesn't have to make sense to be what you've got. - Okay? - Why is it always me? - Because it's always you. - Oh. I want a son. Not tonight. Hello. Who's that? Please, just come kill me. - Allen! - Hey, dad. You okay? Why aren't you in your apartment? I was standing around talking to the wall. So, I figured it was best I wasn't there. I still have a room here? Of course you do, baby! And you are always welcome to it, especially if that girl that you're with has failed to live up to my expectations. - Mom. - Honey! Mmm! That's a very pretty robe. Do you like it? I love it. You look great in it! - Doesn't she look great in it? - Sure. Oh, stop trying to save our relationship. You got out, you came back. You fool. That is a pretty robe, Monica. And you do look good in it. When did I buy that for you? You didn't. It was a gift. Michelle wants to marry me. What for? I came home to consider the idea. Well, how exactly would that work? You would ask yourself the only question that matters. "Does this girl carry within her the potential to suck out your soul like a nosferatu and turn you into an undead, desiccated husk that in any strong wind would leave you afraid you will blow out of your shoes and turn into ashes?" No. Then go forward, my son. I thought you were happy with her? I am happy with her. I'm happy with her every moment we're together. But that's not enough for her. She... She wants me to be happy with her in the future. I think that sounds romantic. Ha! I think it's science fiction. All right. Why are you happy with her now? She's the first person I want to talk to about anything that happens to me. Aww. Well then, why do you want that to change? Why would it change? When you change the relationship, - the relationship changes. - I said that to her. He said that to her! This boy that we made applied sound logic. And what did she say? She wants me to jump off a cliff with her. I mean, is there value in that? In... holding someone's hand and closing your eyes? That's very young. She's traditional, Allen. You know, a perky believer in the happily-ever-after. Which is strange. I thought she was quite intelligent and aware of the world in which she actually lives. - Hey, Monica... - But you may have found the last woman on earth who assumes a happy ending. Hey, Monica! Mon... Would you make us a pot of coffee? I'm sorry, what did you say to me? Because, you know, it's late and we're not thinking clearly. And what could be more important than this? Please, make coffee. Allen, would you tell your father how offensive that is? Because I am standing here talking to my son about his future. I said "please". I used polite and cordial words. Well, I'm not finished talking to him. I'll tell you what. Why don't you go in the kitchen and you make the coffee? By the time you come back, I'll have set him on the proper path and then you can talk to him as long as you want. I tell you what. How about you get your ass in the kitchen and make a pot of coffee or I pick you up and throw you right the fuck out the window? Oh, my. Okay. Huh! Dad? She's confused by my show of strength. We've got, like, a minute. Allen. This girl loves you. I don't care what you think in your youth and indecision, she loves you! How does someone know that? How do I know if I love her? You don't have to. Love is just a word we've attached to describe a feeling we won't really understand until we're old enough to look back on it. And wonder if we ever did. What? Do you love me? - Yes, I do. - Why? - Because I do. - Why? Because you've cared for me. You've seen to my well-being. - Why? Why?! - Maybe ask a different question? - Because you're my father! - Yes! That's it. That's right. That's all. I'm your father. And that's what we've got. We've got mothers and fathers. We've got parents and children. And I... I dedicated myself to you. We've grown up together, and you've made me proud. But, Allen, I didn't choose you. You were given to me. You're not a choice that I made. But what if you were? What if we didn't know each other, and we saw each other on the street? Would there be some sort of pull between us that made you know, "this is my father"? Would I know, "this is my son"? Or would I walk away and not give you a second thought? But the doctor said, "this one is yours." "Take him home." And I understood that relationship completely. But to go out and choose someone for the rest of time, without the benefit of a doctor saying, "this one's yours. Take her home." What kind of a responsibility is that for a person? I've never thought about it like that. I think about it all the time. Allen, look what this girl has done. She's made herself vulnerable for you. And don't worry about if you love her now. It takes a lifetime to love someone. It's the thing we most aspire to because no one has ever figured it out. Until one night, you wake up, and you know everything's okay. 'Cause she's the one lying next to ya. Is that what happened to you? We're talking about you. It's your world now, Allen. If you value my advice, and, Allen, I've been there, marry her. Marry Martha. - Michelle. - And I don't care what the current conversation is out there, some things have to be timeless. Or else, the whole world unravels. Can I ask you something? And I understand if you can't answer me. I'll answer you. If you had to do it all over again, would you still marry mom? Look what I've done! It's magnificent. May I speak with my son now? - Yes. - Thank you. Because it took both of us to make you, Allen. I've never been able to walk away knowing that. What have you done here? I made us some high tea. It's lemongrass chamomile. And cucumber sandwiches with cream cheese and just a little sprig of dill. Cut crusts and everything. You know, he just asked for a pot of coffee. Well, I always improve upon his smaller expectations, and it always goes unappreciated. - This is really good. - Damn right it is. Okay, let's talk about Michelle. Mom, you know what? Let's talk about it in the morning. Right now, I just want to be here. With you. Okay. Thanks a lot, god is brought to you by the archdiocese of New York, and the new Cadillac escalade. - Freeze, sinner! - Whoa! - Yes, I mean you! - Oh. For is there truly one among you who can claim to be clean of sin? We... we just ate chicken! I don't know what those people were doing. And if you pridefully pat yourself on the back because you have not sinned in your actions, are you clean in your mind? Nope. Today's message deals with the seventh commandment. Thou shalt not commit adultery! But there is a way to leap out of the lake of fire. Wait, you know something? This is not about me. - Pray... for... grace! - No, wait! This is not about me! I'm sorry! - Mom? - Oh! Honey. Oh. - I'm sorry. - About what? Well, about... you and Allen. I was in my old room in my old bed thinking, "I was such a good little girl, wasn't I?" Oh! You were the best little girl. Why wouldn't somebody want me forever? Oh! You raised me to believe that love is worth fighting for. Mmm. That it's the only thing that lasts. Yeah, but what did I mean? You told me that finding the right person is one of the most important decisions we make. What's the matter with me? I talk to you too much. Do you still believe it? If he doesn't want you forever, I will end him right now. - Hmm. - Where does that even come from? It comes from knowing there's nothing I can do about this except come on strong. Where is he now, Michelle? I'm sure he couldn't be in the apartment alone either and went back to his family like I did. But how come we've never even talked about his parents? His father's wonderful. You'd love his father. And his mother? He has one. So, you wanna know what killed relationships? Antibiotics. Drop dead at 46 like we used to in the old days, and then it's over really fast. Who cares, right? But "till death do us part" needed a rewrite after penicillin. How many serious relationships have you been in? I thought I had a couple before this one. But now that I have this one... One. - You don't like Michelle? - No, I like her fine, Allen. - She cooks for you? - We cook together. Oh, that's sweet. So, maybe someday you'll take some classes at sur la table. And then, as you're waiting for the souffl to rise, you'll look around and think, "what the hell happened to me?" And I bet she cleans the apartment. We do these things together, mom, are you kidding me? They do things together as a couple. Why doesn't that seem correct to you? Dad, you've just been sitting there? For 40 years. Waiting for food. So, why haven't we met these people? I was just trying to avoid an awkward situation. But why would it be an awkward situation? No father of the girl wants to meet the father of the boy who's been getting it for free. Daddy! Is that what's important to you? Huh? Huh?! That's what's important to him! How do you know what's important to him? Where is the ring? Where's the ring? Yep. Where's the ring? I don't see the ring. I wanna see the ring! Here. - What are you doing? What? - This is a ring. Look at this ring. This, this. This ring means commitment. This ring means loyalty. This ring means trust. Did... Where the hell is the ring? Yeah, well... it's in. - Yeah, that's what it is. - In? Mm-hmm. In where? Where's it in? It's in. I took it in to get it adjusted because my fingers are getting really fatter. What are you talking about? I got the fat fingers. I mean, I just... Oh, what have I done? I didn't want you to know. - Let me see. - Yeah. Fat. Fat fingers. Oh, honey. These are lovely fingers. - Do you really think so? - Yes. Yes, I do. - Yes. - Because... - Yes. Yes. - Okay. You see how emotional she gets about the ring? It's because it's what... What you do with it. It's what everything you put into it and all the emotions around it. And it's like maybe the most important thing you ever get. Where's yours? In my underwear drawer. Uh, I'd like to see it. No. No, no, no. Yeah, but I would like to see your wedding ring. - I haven't seen it... - I don't think... - In a long time, actually. - It doesn't fit. - It jams me. - Oh, I see. You don't think I have it, do you? I wanna see it. No! No. It stays where it is, and you wanna know why? Because every day I see that when I put on my underwear. I am married, and I am covering up my situation. I wanna see the ring. So do I. Where is it? In my night table drawer. Next to the Bible. Get it. You're a good woman, honey. You two are fabulous, you know that? It's your fault I believe in all this stuff. Look, we've already established she's an old-fashioned girl. Maybe she just loves to cook and clean. Why don't you have her over to do the house? Hey! Are you really going to give the rest of your life to someone because they cook and clean? Are you gonna leave it up to us to help you make this decision? I came to you both to learn something. This shouldn't have anything to do with us. Oh, but it really does. Well, what should it have to do with? It should have to do with love. - I found it. Look at that. - Oh! Look at that. Uh-huh. That is the symbol of our love. Put it on, honey. Um... you know, I... Boy, I... I don't think it's gonna fit these fingers. You wanna kiss 'em? Here. You know what I'm gonna do? - [Grunts aggressively - yeah, you hurt me. I'm sorry. Never take that off again, okay? I understand your position, honey. Look at that. Bing. That's really on now. That's on there good. Bing! - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm. On there forever just because I asked her one question. Do you love me? What do you mean? And if the answer is yes, I wanna know why. I was originally captured by your strong sense of interior design. That's why you love me? Does Michelle make you happy? I think so. How can you not know if you're happy? Are you happy, dad? I'm as happy as I'm gonna get. Michelle, we're fine with whatever you do. We just hope that we were good influences. We always told you the truth that we believed at the time, honey. Like when you said I would never be a ballerina? I know, honey. I'm sorry. You won't. - Here's truth. - Okay. These people are as much to blame as we are for all of us arriving at this point. You think they'd have the courtesy to invite us to dinner? I mean, our kid sleeps with their kid. Doesn't that entitle us to a dinner? He's right. Yes! Just get him over here. - Yes. - Mom, seriously? Oh, I'm not gonna be blamed for what I taught you, okay? Go! Yeah. Come on, let's do it. Except, why can't we go there? Why does everything have to be expensive for me? Michelle, my bell! - Yikes. - How are you? We were just talking about you. Hi. You were? Endlessly. Yes... Howdy. Howdy to you too. Here's an interesting thing that's gonna happen, but first, I miss you. I miss you too. Great. My parents wanna have you guys over for dinner tonight. They think it would be nice if we all finally got together. I'd rather just get married. So, I'll see you tonight? Instinctively, a bad idea. Do it. So, Michelle and her parents would like to have you over for dinner tonight. - All of us? - No. I'm not going to that. Mute. Where's mute? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. This is a sucker play. They're throwing out the net. She's gonna reel you in like a trout. You take care of it. Go ahead, Sam, take care of it. Hi, Michelle. - Hi. - Listen. We'd love to come. - What?! - Amazing. My parents are so excited to meet you guys. How's seven o'clock? That's great. Can we bring anything? Just yourselves. I'm sure that will be plenty. Looking forward to it. Why don't you wanna meet these people? What could we possibly have in common? Whoo! Yay! I'm in mamaroneck. There isn't enough alcohol in the world. I have a little bit of a buzz on. This one's a lack of awareness bordering on hallucination. I'll get it! God bless us, everyone. Michelle, hi. Yep. Michelle. Darling! Aww, mwah! - Mmm. - Oh, right. Oh, what a lovely little house. Look, Sam, this is exactly what we would have if I did quaint. And mama and papa, where are they? You did say seven, didn't you? You are right on time. They're just running a little late. Well, we could come back another time, couldn't we? What works for you, sweetheart? - Mother! - Yeah! I should've been ready, like, twenty-flaggh minutes ago. Hey! Oh, my goodness. Allen, hi. - Hi. - And wait a minute. Of course, you must be Allen's mother. Monica. It is so nice to finally meet you. - Well, thank you. - Yeah. Thank you. We really should've done this a long time ago. - Right? - Yeah. Well, now that you've met my mother, I'd like to introduce you to... Dad? Well, Allen, where is your father? Couldn't he make it? My husband, did he leave us here? The door's open, so, maybe... - He's outside? - Oh, dear. Really? Dad? Hey, everybody! Sorry I'm a little late. Hey! You're in my house? Yeah. It's even worse than that. You can't kill me now. I've got company. - Guess what? - What? - What? - I'm the company. Ha-ha! No, no, no... Dad? Yeah! That's my son Allen who's with your wife, holding your daughter. Oh, dear god. Howard, uh, this is Monica. And, Monica, this is my husband, Howard. How do you do? Hi. I'm Howard. This is where I live. This is my daughter, Michelle. I am the father of her. You know where I live now. I found your little house. Mmm. Instinctively, bad idea. Um, yeah. You know what this is? This is, um, what would you call this, a little free-floating anxiety? - More. - Way more. Right. Right, because everyone knows how important this is, sweetie, really. And so, we're just trying to make sure that it's an evening to remember. Oh, that must be my husband. Oh! Oh, well, I'll let him in. And we'll all loosen up right now. You'll see. You'll see. Oh! Well... No, no. I, um... That actually wasn't your husband. But can I ask you a couple questions about your husband? - Mom. - Huh? Because it's... it's all really too much, honey. It's just... it's like... I mean... This could decide the rest of our lives. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think she's right. - Yeah. - I think... I think that everybody... Should go home. What? As clearly as I could, I said it. Guys, this is happening. We... we want to decide the rest of our lives. Well, we don't, actually. We do, and we can't if you don't open the door. Pray for grace. Um... Oh! Uh... Look what you did to him. No, you're right. We should do this more often. You have to do something. You have to do something. It's your house. Would anyone care for a drink? - Yes! - Ah, Michelle. Allen? We'll have wine, thank you. Wine. Grace, a drink? I do now. Oh, yes. I'll have the usual. Come on. All right. Tanqueray Martini. Extra dry with a twist. - Ow! - Oh, now it's "ow"? What's his name? - Sam. - Sam! - Yeah. - What are you drinking, buddy? - Bourbon. - How about a double? How about the bottle? Who could blame you? Oh... Look, why don't I help him make the drinks, and you take everyone on a tour of the house? Neither one should take very long. Actually, Michelle and I have a lot to talk about. Would you like to step outside? I was wondering if you had a place I might feel safe? Mom, show Allen's father around. Oh! Of course. You will love him. What a thing to say, honey. What a thing to say. Hi. Um, here. Um... Just, uh... um... You didn't tell me that you have children. You told me your son was six years old. He was once. And you told me that you were 54. - I was once. - Oh! So, what are you now? Sixty-seven. Oh, 67! Yeah, yeah. I'll be 68 last year. Oh, no! I was making it with a corpse. Oh, lovely. Really lovely. I mean, why would anyone ever leave you? Oh, you are not leaving me. I'm already gone, morticia. No. I think we just had an off night. No! Monica, what... - Look... look at me. - Mmm. We don't even like each other. Why keep this going? You don't understand how difficult it is to start a new clandestine relationship. You have to keep track of what guy goes with what. Sam thinks I'm angry at him. I'm not angry at him. I just lost track of him. Well, you're not mad at me either. You screwed up your own life. You're the only one who can figure out a way to find some kind of happiness or whatever you're looking for. I don't care. I'm still killing you. Monica, nobody has to kill anyone. Time is doing a fine job of that. - Grace... - This is our backyard. And this is where we go when we want to come to the back of the house. Last night was the sweetest night I can remember. Oh, well, for me too, Sam. But we really can't think about that now, because what if the kids get married? Well, that'd be fantastic. Things couldn't work out any better. We'd... we'd have excuses to see each other all the time. Oh. Mmm. Is that incest? I mean... it's... Grace, I think fate meant us to be together. Look, last night was the best night I've had in a long time. But I want to hear those words and feel those feelings with my husband. Last night, I had feelings about my marriage too. Mmm. What? I hate my wife. - You do not. - I hate her guts. Why would you say that? - I live with her. - Sam! Because she hates me. There's too much love in you to hate anybody. And there is too much love in you to not have it returned. Let me return it, grace. We live a long time. And we'll have kids. We'll watch them grow. And we'll be 50. Please understand that that's a good thing. I understand it's a good thing when we're us. But, Michelle, they were us. They believe what you believe. They believed they wouldn't lose their minds. All I've been asking is what happens to us on the way to them. Do we wake up on some cloudy Tuesday and we're just not excited by each other anymore? You will always be excited by me. Look at me. I'm on my little bed. Don't get on my bed looking like that. I got dressed for your parents. My mother wears turtlenecks. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off! You don't touch me anymore, remember? Oh, yeah. Now you can get in bed with me. Don't say anything. Just don't. Do we spend the greater part of our lives as crazy as they are? Do you really think they're crazy? Because I don't. I had feelings last night. I didn't know I was still capable of having feelings like that. Yeah? There's only one possible thing we can do. Forget it ever happened. You and me, - Tahiti. - Oh, so I'm way off here. This isn't coincidence. Things happen on purpose so that we can figure out what to do with our lives. And our lives have led us here. It's not real. Sam! This isn't real. Wouldn't you want this with a nice, younger woman? Well, my wife is younger than me. So, what I've learned from that is... no. And she's real. She's as real as it gets. But forgetting last night happened isn't real, because it did. What's real is that it did. I mean, what do you think happened last night? Sam, nothing happened. Everything happened. We talked. We had conversation. When's the last time you really talked to someone? We shared the intimacy that matters the most because I think that by not touching each other, we touched each other. And... it's what I want, grace. Don't you? I grew up with them. I watched them stay together while all my friends' parents fell apart. I admired it. I've watched mine too. I can only go by what I've seen. And if that is built into the deal, will we be smart enough to recognize it when it comes? Will we recognize how easy it is to arrive at a place where I'm not allowed to say "I love you" even though I really think I do. Allen. We're so good together. What are you doing? I don't want it to happen to us. So, help me out, okay? You help me out. How do you marry a person you love? How do you do that to somebody? Wow. You're angry at me? How could I be? This has nothing to do with you and me at all. Oh, my goodness. Have you come to a decision? I'm gonna try one last time. Don't let what you don't know is coming get in the way of what you know we have now. I do know what's coming. I understand there's gonna be easy parts, like our wedding day and the birthdays of our children, and I understand we're gonna be all over each other for the first five years. Thanks for the image, kid. But what about the hard parts? What about the day that we don't remember we gave each other the best parts of our lives? Because... Because we're too busy blaming each other for being two middle-aged potatoes. Oh, god. Honesty can't hurt us. So, you make me see. What keeps that from being the rest of our lives? You're wrong about the easy part. The easiest thing we could do is smash this up and move on and keep asking ourselves the same questions but with other people. And if I do... If I do find somebody else, the difference will be that I already knew you. You will be my frame of reference for loving somebody, and I will compare them to you and they will fail. Why would you do that to me? And if we do someday have children with someone else, your little girl won't look like me. You won't be able to see me and everything we've gone through over the years in her face. And when she finds her person, it'll never remind you of what you and I had together. That's how we hang onto the best parts of our lives, Allen. That's what saves us. Jump with me. How can you ask me to promise you we won't go crazy later? You're crazy now. Unless you found something. Have you finally found something wrong with me? You've had enough time, so just tell me. Just tell me. What's wrong with this girl right here, right now? We're us, Allen. Nobody else. And I will miss you for the rest of my life. Honey, come on... Allen... Go after her, please. No, he's gotta do this by himself, buddy. Nothing. There's nothing the matter with you. I've never not ever found one thing wrong. You raised the most wonderful person I know. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. And she's my best friend. I don't care what she does to me. Now that's a good way to go into this. We did this to them? Mostly you. I always wondered why babies are born so helpless and why we get them when they can't do anything. And I always thought that was for us. So that we'd look back when they grew up, and be proud that we taught them everything that they knew. Because they didn't know anything. But it wasn't for us at all, was it? It's for them. It's to keep them from realizing that we don't know what we're doing for as long as possible. But you know what? They figure it out anyway. We knew what we were doing. You heard him. We've raised an incredible daughter. I want another chance. What? I would get it right this time. We got a lot of it right. No. Didn't you see her? She's a ballerina and I missed it. Okay. Well, we can't do it again. You get one ride. - And one ride only. - Uh-huh. We've done what we've done. Well, why didn't you just stop me from becoming a potato? You're not a potato. I am, I am. I'm a potato. And it was your responsibility to stop me when - I started turning into one. - Grace. It... But you weren't paying attention. I'm sorry I made you feel that way. I think my son is absolutely right. About what? Honesty cannot hurt us. Sure it can. Would everyone like to start out with some little hot dogs? - No. - I made them because everyone likes them and nothing bad has happened - when I make them. - The four of us, for instance. Have we really been honest with each other? - Monica! - Oh, right. You... you should... - Probably take this, yeah. - Yeah, it's my house, - so I spoke up, but she's... - My wife, so I guess... On you, yeah. - Unless you'd rather... - No. I, for one, have absolutely no intention of living out the rest of my life even remotely being thought of as a potato. Nobody thinks of you as a potato. Oh, really? What do they think of me as? That thing that mashes the potato. But I will be living the rest of my life honestly. And so, I don't want to talk about tonight anymore. I think she's right. I think whatever happens, the kids have this well in hand. I want to talk about last night. This evening is not about what you want, Monica. Oh, what's it about? It's about Michelle and Allen, and our part in the decision they're making. They've watched us their whole lives. They know who we are, and they don't want to be us. I don't want to be us either. Monica, I'd like to talk to you. You do? You wanna talk to me, really? Well, you go right ahead, Sam. - Not here. - Oh. Where would you prefer? Someplace private. The bedroom? The bedroom's private. Do you wanna talk in the bed... May we borrow your bedroom? We're just gonna talk in it. We don't kiss or do anything like that anymore. We used to kiss every night before we went to bed. We made a point of it, and I liked that. It was hopeful. What was it he said? Do you even remember that we gave each other the best parts of our lives? I remember everything. But when you stop kissing each other good night, and you just say "goodnight" or sometimes you don't say that, and then you just turn out your little light and roll over and you leave me sitting there, then it's necessary to go elsewhere for hopeful. Do you know what I'm saying? - No! - Or look elsewhere for a memorable evening with the lights on. What do you think I do at night when I'm not at home, Sam? I try not to think about it. Oh, why don't you think about it? Because it doesn't matter to me. Because I just want to turn over and go to sleep. Okay, you asked your question. - You got your answer. - Well, it matters to me. It matters to me what happened last night. So, in the continuing search for a memorable evening, I'm just gonna sparkle this one up a little. No! It wasn't me. I wasn't with him. No, honey, you don't have this right. - What? - I knew I'd get caught. Next time, why don't I just send invitations? Why do you both not have this right? I was home in front of the television, and you know that, Howard, and you know that. Of course you were. Of course I know that. Yeah. I wasn't, Howard. I wasn't home. Grace, what the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about me and grace. What are you talking about? Well, I was talking about me and Howard. But, obviously, the news is elsewhere. Howard! Grace, I made a terrible mistake. I mean, obviously! You know her now. How could you do this?! How could I? How could you? The same way you could. And since when could you? I could and I'm good at it. I just killed you. Now it's over. Have a nice day. How long have you known my wife? Four months. How long have you? One night. Hardly seems fair. - She have fun? - What? Did my wife have fun? We had one wonderful evening. Good. That's good. You're not angry about that? Yeah, well, who am I supposed to be angry at, her? Like she doesn't deserve to have whatever she wants? You...? You seem like the sweetest guy alive. All we did was talk to each other. What? That's all. We talked for hours. You talked for hours? About every little thing. She wouldn't let anything else happen. That's all she wanted. She continues to prove herself to be a better person than me. So, what are we supposed to do now? I don't know. Wanna beat each other up? Yeah. N... no... - Okay. Ca-ca-ca... - Come on, get up. - Get up. - Okay. Are you in love with my wife? Huh? What, are you kidding me? No! No! No! Damn it. No. Come on. I'm sorry. Sam. Sam, I'm sorry. It was a mistake. It was a mistake. Yeah, probably for me too. Yeah. Sam. It's okay, it's okay. Yeah. Sam, buddy. There's a whole big world out there for you. Guy like you, what kind of world would this be if there wasn't a happy ending for a guy like you? Maybe it's possible. Your wife taught me that I can love again. Yeah, great. That's really great. You really have feelings for her, don't you? I want to go to Tahiti with her. Well, I probably shouldn't allow that, should I? Okay, go. Yeah. I'll give you three days. That's incredibly civilized of you. Yeah, well, it's certainly what I deserve. She doesn't want to go with me. - No? - She wants that from you. It's all she's ever wanted. She's loved you her whole life. You'd think that would be the simplest thing in the world to live with, wouldn't you? I wouldn't know. I don't see where looking you in the eye is gonna work for either one of us. I'm interested in knowing who initiated this thing. You or my husband. And you're gonna ask me questions you really don't want the answers to. Okay. Did you have conversations with my husband? Yes. - Did you have sex with mine? - No. Huh. Someone should. Did you tell Michelle - that love lasts forever? - Yes. So, when you found out that it didn't, did you just go crazy and do whatever you wanted and rationalize any behavior? - No. - Okay. It's just me then. I just found out it wasn't true right now. What did I do? His behavior with me had nothing to do with loving you. Are you kidding? I met you three hours ago and I'd marry you. I will leave his ass in the dirt. Do you want to know why you won't? Please. The only person he's unsatisfied with is himself. But why? You wake up one morning and you just feel like the world is passing you by, and there's nothing you can do about it and so... You become a wrecking ball. He's just a beginner, grace. You can stop him, if you want. I will stand here for the rest of my life until you look at me. It's the only time I've done anything like this. It was obvious. Uh... You're proud of that. I don't understand. Are you proud of that? No. No, I'm not proud of anything. I did something awful. I don't know why. All I know is that you'll never have to worry about me doing anything like that ever again. - Why? - Because it's not the answer. Why? Why did you feel like you needed to go looking somewhere else? If you had questions, you're supposed to come to me. It's like, I'm always, like, - right here, so... - I know. - You always have been. - Yeah. I... I hurt... The person I love because you're the one who's there. What? What? - What, what, what, what, what? - I... wait. I'll spend the rest of our lives making sure that I know how you feel about whatever happens to us. - Yeah. - About how... What you need from me. And... - And maybe just about... - What? About time... As it goes by. You made me do that with someone else. Now what happens? You go after her, and she forgives you. Why should she? Because she believes the best possible rest of her life has always been with you. So why didn't you stop me? I always thought you were more interesting than me, Monica. I always hoped life would be better because I knew you. But there was never any stopping you. There was only living with you as long as I could. Well, you've stayed up until now. We had a son. Love our son. Well, only you and I could've made him. Marriage. Mm-hmm. We meet the love of our life, is what we think, at the time. But then, time goes by. How long do we give each other until we turn into the people we always hoped we would be? Maybe we do wake up one day, still lying next to each other, and we finally understand the promise we made. That we would give each other the best rest of our lives. What if we don't get there? What happens to us then? But it's not our world anymore, is it? It's their world now. Wherever thou goest, I will go. And where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people will be my people. And thy god my god. And where thou diest, shall I die, and there will I be buried. I grew up wondering if I would be able to stand in front of someone and promise her the rest of my life. But here we are. I belong to you, and whatever happens, let it happen with you. You ready to jump off the cliff with me? Yeah. Whoo! Oh! Whoa!
