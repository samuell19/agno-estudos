(tires screeching) (melancholy music) (stream running) (birds chirping) - Whatever else. Your daddy was a god fearing man, Travis. It ain't right. - It says here. I, uh, I can't read that fine print. Sheriff, would you mind? (clock ticking) - Says here your daddy left just about everything to that preacher fella on TV. Money and stock mostly. Of course, you do get all the land. And he goes on to say if you work hard you just may make something of your life. Says you get the family collectibles. That would be your mother's embroidery. This coin collection. And your mother's thimbles. - Don't know much about thimbles. But as I recall it's an impressive coin collection. That's his daddy's chain, ain't it? - Well that's worth a heap of money. Maybe you'd like to keep it down at the bank. - No. - Know, your daddy showed me a couple of confederate bills once. They're probably not worth anything but uh I'd be willing to pay top dollar. What do you say? - No. - Easy, Andrew. You're starting to drool all over the judge's table. He can't break up that collection. It's been in his family for over a hundred years. - Well, I thought I'd give it a shot. - Is that all? - Well, if you two would sign this we'll get it done. (melancholy music) (chickens clucking) (horses neighing) - [Bobby] Hey, Travis. You up there in the hayloft? You need to get these stairs fixed. - [Travis] Bobby, what a surprise. You usually knock. Come on in. - Thought you might be thirsty. Sorry about your dad. (bottles opening) I'm off duty. So when are you taking off? - I don't know. Soon I guess. - That's good. You've been talking about it since high school. Traveling the world. Meeting exotic women. The way I see it now's your big chance. - I guess they're not women that know you. - Talking about Chris Bodie again? God damn. That was just perfect. You know she was hitting on me at the hoe down. I - She was my date. - Gotta move fast. - You move late. - You'll never leave. - You never know. - Yeah. I think I do. Catch you later. (scary music) (organ playing) (country music) - Thanks for the ride. (truck engine roaring) (birds chirping) Hi there. Oh boy. I think I'm lost. Kelly. - I'm sorry. Travis. - Please to meet you, Travis. Could you help me? I was trying to get to Watkins. - Watkins? You're here. Outside of Astonville. Watkins is there 30 miles away. - You know if there's a bus or anything around there? - Train runs through town. You hungry? - What? - You hungry? 'Cause if you are. I was just getting ready to have some lunch. You can join me if you want. And then I can take you back into town afterwards. If you're hungry. - Okay. Let's eat. - I haven't really thought about it until just now. Hey. You forgot your bag. (clock ticking) - Oh my God. How long I was asleep? - Four and a quarter hours. - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. Could you take me into town? Get a room at the Traveler's Club. - It's too late. I mean I'm sorry I let you sleep so much. I guess I figured well I figured that if it would be alright with you that you could stay here tonight. It's a big house. All the rooms. The doors lock. Besides I sleep in the hayloft. - The hayloft? How come? - I just do. My father lived in the house. - Oh wow. Nice collection. Winchester 1894. - '92 actually. You know guns? - Yeah. They kinda run in the family. - Yeah? Mine too. It's good 'cause we got 'em all over the house. - Do you have to stay out in the hayloft? - If you feel safer. - I'd feel safer if you stayed in the house. - Sorry? - I'd feel safer if you stayed in the house. - Sure. I mean, okay. Room's this way. - Travis? You're a real gentleman. - [Travis] Station's just a little further up. ("Somebody's Fool" by David Allan Morgan) So what are you gonna do when you get to Watkins? - Ricky went there to be an actor at that Gem Theater, you know? - The dinner theater in Watkins? - Yeah. - You sure? - Sure I'm sure. - Well. I think it's been closed for a lot of years. - Really? - I'm pretty sure. We used to go there when I was a kid. - Well shit. (dramatic music) - When's the last time you talked to him? - Well, we sorta broke up. Before he left and I told ya I was gonna surprise him. - I'm sorry. Eat somethin'? Come on. - [Jolene] If I had to fly back to London. To cover up the incompetence. I would not be pleased. Because I told you. - [Lutie] Hey Travis. - Hey Lutie. Where's Earl? - He's kinda takin' a day off. Can we get a couple OJ's please. - Comin' right up. Hey, Travis. Our TV is kinda actin' up. Suppose you could have a look at it? - Sure. - [Jolene] I'm sick and tired of you screwing things up when I'm not there to hold your hand. - Who's the girl? - I wouldn't if you don't know. - So introduce me. - She's just passin' through town. - Then I suppose to tell her. - You're Travis Graham, aren't you? - That's right. - I'm Jolene. I hear you're looking to sell some property in this area. - News sure does travel fast. - I'm looking to buy. Do you think I could see your place? - Well, there's really not much to see. - You're not gonna sell your house are you? - Depends on what she's offerin'. - Oh, I'm sure I could make you a very attractive offer, Mr. Graham. - Excuse me. Travis, didn't you say your great granddaddy built that house? Can't just up and. Look I'm sorry. I'm embarrassing you. Take it from somebody who's never really had much of a home. Family. Pretty soon you're gonna start to miss it. - Miss Leder. I appreciate your interest. But I'm really not sure yet. - There's no harm in just taking a look. Is there? - I'll let you know. Nice to meet you. - Okay. - Small town. Nobody minds their own business. - Travis, take your hat off when you're inside. - Sheriff Bob. - That's the sheriff? I've never seen a sheriff without a gun before. - He doesn't need one. - Hey Travis. You drivin' the Chevy to the hoedown? Wouldn't be the same without an arrival from the Graham family. - I hadn't thought about it. - A hoedown? I love a hoedown. - Don't you have some place to go? - Nowhere to go. No money to get there. Maybe you could use a hand around the ranch. - Maybe. - [Anchorwoman] Two armed robbers got away with over $10,000 dollars. - I tell you. It's one damn crazy world out there these days. (crashing noise) - You think I'm sellin'? This is my place. God damnit! (screams) - Put that bat down. - Earl. - Earl, you put that bat down or I'm dropping you where you stand. (glass shattering) - Let's just all calm down now. Earl, you drive away your customers. - You back down or you're goin' down. - You better get your son's gun out of my face this is my place. I ain't fuckin' around. - Put the gun down, Bobby. I said put the gun down. Now. Earl. My thickheaded, jackass son's not listenin' to me. What I'm gonna do is walk over there and take his gun away. Don't want you puttin' that bat upside my head now. - Do it, Bob. Do it. - Bobby. Give me the gun. - Please put the bat down, Sir. - Deputy, you don't give me that gun you can give me your badge. - There you are, Earl. You're callin' the shots now. - Get him out of here, Bob. - Mr. Yates would like you to leave his diner. - What are you lookin' at? - You think maybe that bat could use a rest? Let me get you a cup of coffee. You and me and Lutie will talk. - Now you know why he doesn't need a gun. (crickets chirping) (soft country music) (dog barking) - I'm sorry. Your mom she had such nice things. - Maybe don't tell 'em in shorts. That's real nice. You being here. - Sorry I'm not more help but these gloves are so big. Do you smell that? - Yeah, somethin'. - Let's check it out. Oh my God. It's so sad. What happened? - Must have got separated from his mom. Then the coyotes got to him. - Poor baby. - Excuse me. I'm gonna burn it in the furnace. - Burn it? Shouldn't we have buried it? - Dogs would have just come and dug it up. - Wow, I love Paris by night. - Sorry. - You know. There's nothing more romantic than sharing a late night. - Sydney? - I lived there. - Really? What was it like? - Well. You know. It's a strange thing but it's a lot like Astonville. I'm joking. Paris. Paris is breathtaking. But I personally prefer this. - Ma'am. - I'll tell you all about it when you let me take a look at your place. - Well, it's like I said. I'm not so sure that I want to sell right now. - Now. You don't want to sell or your girlfriend doesn't want you to sell? What about your father? - What about him? - He loved that house very, very much. - So? - You know it's a small town and people talk. From what I gather. Your father loved that house more than just about anything. (dramatic music) - I really should be going. Well, that's just folks talking about things that they don't understand. - All the more reason to get away. Don't you think? I'm staying at Tanner's Inn. Not exactly The Savoy but. I must admit. I'm used to getting what I want, Mr. Graham. I am not a patient woman. - Whoo! God, it's beautiful here. I could stay here forever and never get tired of it. Who's place is that? - Opal and Arthur Del Ripple. They're out of town for a while. Do me a favor. Remind me that I gotta feed their cat. - Sure. - So anyway tell me more about Corpus Christi. - Yeah, well that's where I'm from originally, you know? Texas. Then Milwaukee. (rifle blast) So what was that? - Almost dinner. - Shotgun worse than that. It's a tough shot though. - Well I just like to try my luck. - There's some to the left of the oak. - That's a tough shot. - Yeah, right flank. (rifle blast) Steady hand. Crazy heart. Runs in my family. ("The Great Divide" by David Allan Morgan) Do you think you could give me a massage? (fire crackling) (moaning) You okay? - Yeah. - That's okay. (erotic music) What's this? - Scar. - From what? - Football. (birds chirping) - Shit. I was patented. - You're so cute. - [Travis] My parents didn't want me. - You didn't. I thought I was a bad kid too. My Uncle Buddy. My brother insisted my Mom told me Families can be so screwed up. That won't happen to us. 'Cause we're the best of our marrow (car horn honking) - Hi. I was on my way to the property down the road and I thought I'd stop by and say howdy. - Howdy. Some car. It's nice to see you. - Is this a good time to look around? (suspenseful music) - I really don't know. - Tick tock, Mr. Graham. Bye. (car engine starting) (sneezing) - Hi cutie pie. - Hi. - I found this under the gun case. What's it for? - I don't know. - You don't know? (clock ticking) (suspenseful music) - Travis? - Yeah. - Hi, how are you? - Good, how are you? - I'm good. You're handy with TVs aren't you? - Sure. - Well, the one in my hotel room there's something wrong with it and nobody's come by to take a look at it and well do you think you could spare the time just to have a quick look? Please? - Well, I really. - Oh, it won't take too long. Please Travis. - Sure. Loose cable just like a food mixer. - Really? That's a coincidence. I'd like to give you something. I wrote this.

This the bank robbers? - Yeah, they robbed the bank out at Two Pines this morning. The teller got a look at the two inside. But not the driver. Where were you this morning? - I'll see you later, Bobby. - Travis. - Where? Where is it? - [Travis] Kelly? - Yeah? - What are you doing? - I'm opening up the room. It's a little stuffy in here. - That's not a very good idea. You shouldn't be doing that. This was my father's room and no one's supposed to be in here. - Oh, come on. I'm not hurtin' nothin'. What's with the hairdo? It's so short. And there's no stuff in it. (water running) - Turn around. Soap. What is this, now? What's Kiki? - Me. Kelly. Kiki, you know.

I closed my London deal and I I had nobody to celebrate with. So I. - So we're celebratin'. And I'm doin' a little cleanin' around the house. - Aren't you gonna congratulate me? - Congratulations. - I congratulated you already. - Thank you. Thank you, both. - I guess now you can get that look at my place that you've been meain' to. - No, no. No. - I didn't look. - She didn't. That's true. She did not look. I said no talking about that. - That's right. Absolutely no business. - [Travis] So slow. - No, you take the cross. (screaming) (laughing) (clock ticking) Come on. Come on. You didn't pay your bill you. - Stay here. I'll be right back. - [Jolene] We're scared. Travis it's dark and there's fleas and mice. - Open. Beer or whiskey. - Beer. And whiskey! - Okay. (rock music) - Thank you. Thank you. - Drinks. Music. Wait. Wait no. Let me get my. What do you guys wanna listen to? I'm looking at country. (dramatic music) - Don't.

I'll tell you when. You don't need to be watching. I guarantee he wishes he were you. Hello. - Good morning. Where's Jolene? - She got up early. And just denied her. - What about you? - No one forces me to do things I don't wanna do. Nice. Almost natural. I was thinkin'. As long as Jolene's in town maybe she could stay here. It's lonely in a motel. - You serious? - Why not? I mean I don't think it will last night. It be fun to have her. It be like our own family. - Morning, Travis. - Morning. - Morning, Travis. - Morning. - Usual? - Yes please. - [Robber] Alright, everybody. Quiet. Money.

'Cause I'm fixin' to fuck her. - Drop it. - No, you son of a bitch. You drop it. This sweet little bitch. She's gonna be one big fat greasy stain on your carpet.

She ran off down across the road. I don't know what they were doin' but they were arguin' pretty bad. - You alright? You Okay? You don't feel bad or sad or nothin'? - No. I'm okay. I shouldn't feel bad. Tried to hurt me now he's. His fault he's. - I gotta call Bobby Jr. - No. - Yes. I saw we should trust him - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Baby, think about what just happened here. I gotta call Bobby Jr. He can take care of all of this. - No. It's over. We don't have to call. We don't have to call anybody. - Calm down, it's gonna be okay if I just call Bobby Jr, alright? Please? - No! (crying) We. We don't Don't have to call. It's you and me, baby. We can keep this between us. - His partner's dead too. I found him in their car. I really should go and take care of it. - When I'm done. - Ah! Shit. - I haven't told anyone this before. Three years ago this man my neighbor came in to borrow some sugar. So he said. When I went to the kitchen to get it. Grabbed me by the hair and bent me over the kitchen table. I couldn't. He lifted my dress and cut off my underwear with his pocket knife. Said he'd cut me too if I move. I heard his zipper. Then he got on top of me. And I reached and I clawed on that table. Then he dropped his knife. I grabbed it. He slapped me in the head and I cut his arm. He fell forward on top of me on the floor and I kept stickin' on him over and over and over. Then he died. They say I was a bad girl from a bad family anyways so I must of asked for it. And he gave his 10% to the church. And that makes good. Daddy didn't believe me either. So I ran. They were gonna stuff me in this jail with kids with psychiatrists but my sister took me away. She said nobody fucks with family. Cops around here will think I asked for it again. Know what I mean? - Nobody has to know about what happened here tonight. Alright, you're next, partner. (car engine humming) Shit. - Hi. What are you doing? - Just fixing some things. - What? - Just things. - Well. Hurry up and come inside please. I think she's lying to you. Okay? How long? - Two minutes. I'll see you inside. - Alright. Don't be long. ("Catch My Soul If You Dare" by Stella) Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot. Let me make it better. Oh. - Ow! - Oh, Travis. You need to take a shower. Bad. Why don't you give us a rest. Okay? (water running) - Didn't take much convincin'. Said the motel beds aren't as comfortable as ours. - Company is better too. Hi. - So, now okay? - Sure. - Good. Left. First second. Right. - I'll fine it. - Four deaths have been attributed to them. As well as the theft of what's believed to be over $200,000 dollars. In other robbery related news. Services for Sheriff Robert Brody will be held this Saturday at the Newport Church in Astonville. The Kiwanis Club as acting ushers. - I I know. - Know what? - It's okay. Kelly, she told me. You did the right thing, Travis. No. It's best for everyone this way. Trust me. So, um. You didn't like think of calling the bank or anything did you? - No. Just keep on. - Have you looked through it yet? No? - No. No. Can't be right. There's only $7,000 dollars here. - What? - That's it. Just the money from the bank in town. - Where's the rest from the other robberies? - I don't know. - They probably stashed it after each hit, you know? In case they got caught and had to leave. I can't believe all this stuff. - What? - Nothing. I mean. Just the plans for their next job. Maps. Timed schedule. They were gonna hit the bank up in Hurley. - So? - So? I was just thinking if maybe maybe we could do what they were planning to do. And then dump the car. I mean no one would be any the wiser. - What? (dramatic music) - You're not serious. (laughing) - Why not? - 'Cause we're not bank robbers. That's why not. - I'm telling you something, Travis Graham. I've been a million different things and a million different places. I've experienced things you've never even dreamed of. And I didn't get to those experiences by playing it safe. - Wait a minute. - Oh, come on, Travis. Live for once. - What if we get caught? - We won't get caught. This is the perfect opportunity. The real robbers are dead, right? And we're the only ones that know that. We've got their car. And we have alibis for the other robberies. All we have to do is get away clean. What a rush. God, just taste it. - Let's do it. - Not you. - Why not me? I'm a good driver. - Travis, it says right here that after shift change there's only two tellers and one guard. The manager's at lunch. So, we're in and out clean. - Didn't you ever play cops and robbers when you were a kid? Didn't you? - Yes. - Okay. - I'll wait. Let me guess. Bobby Jr played the cop. And you played the robber. Am I right? - Yes. - Bobby Jr. announces you Travis. First time I met him. That day in the diner. When he told me that you might wanna sell some property. He made a complete mockery of you. Now I'd have thought you might wanna turn the tables for once. - You have no reason to use this. - Okay. Fine. I mean we're gonna do it. With or without you. It be a lot easier with you but. Come on, Kelly. (laughing) We'll do it. - I just need a minute to think. - What you got to think about? Come on. It be a good story for our grandkids God dangit! Rob the bank! Rob the bank! Rob the bank! (clock ticking) - This is crazy. (rock music) - [Kelly] Come on! - Those are different till right? - Yep. - When do I get a gun? - You don't get one. - I'm a better shot than you. - You won't need one. Don't need to be a robber to think that. - Just in case, okay? - I don't want this one. You take it. - Here. - Take it, Travis. - I'm so wet right now. - Ready? - In and out. Clean and fast, right? - Right. - Right. - Right? - Right, yes. - Let's do this. (heavy country music) - [Travis] Quiet! Money. No one gets dead. Everybody on the floor now. I said get down on the God damn floor. Alright, Macho Man, get down there. Where the hell is the guard? - Don't be afraid, darlin'. Be nice and you'll be home in time for supper. Fill her up. - Get up. Where's the guard? Get out of there. Where the hell is the fucking guard? - Hurry up. Come on, let's go. - He's at lunch. - Shut up. - Come on, come on. - Shit. - Fill her up. - Please, for the Jesus of God, hurry. - Hurry! Let's go. Come on, come on. Fill a bag. Come on. Fill her up. - Freeze! - Make your choice, Mister. I said make your choice. - No! (shots fired) - Fuck me! Come on, let's get out of here. Piece of shit. - Come on, Travis. - Start the car, Kelly. I think I just pointed though. Fucking old man shouldn't have tested me. - Did you kill him? - I hope not. - Are you okay? - No, I gotta drive. (shouting) - Let's get us a son of a bitch. - What you do, man? (police siren wailing) - Shit! (screams) - Oh, my God! - Hold on. I'm gonna blow his tires. - No, what are you, Travis? - Come on. - When you gonna shoot his tires? - Throw the bag. - What the fuck are you doing? - Knock it off. - Give us a kiss for this. (shouting) Cops can't drive. Let's go. I wanna fuck. - Stop it. Stop it. - I'm fucking you so hard. - Travis, don't. - You want it. - No. Stop it, you asshole. - Shut up. - Let me go. - Shut up. You want it. I know you want it. Bitch. Shut up. Shut up. I'm fucking done this before. Shut up. Just shut up. - Baby. You okay? - Oh, God. He's gone crazy. - Who the fuck do you think you are? - [Newscaster] Story of the bank robbers continues to grow each day. Oddly enough the suspects dumped a thousand dollars worth of money by throwing it at the squad car. Officer Mike Thorton who had spotted and was following the suspects. (police sirens wailing) - Sorry to wake you, Travis. - No problem. What's up? - Another robbery. Guard got shot. - Really? - Yeah. Strange you know. The roads around Hurley got closed off pretty quick. They're definitely still in the area though. You haven't seen or heard anything have you? - No. - Those girls with you here? Jolene and - [Travis] Kelly. - Kelly. Yeah. I'm gonna need to talk to them. - Sure. - [Bobby] Were they around here today? - Working with me all day. Why? - Nothing, it's just. The witness from the robbery out in Two Pines said that was a woman in the gang of three. What do you know about this Jolene any way? This real estate lady. - She's alright. Look, um what difference does it make? I mean I just got through telling you that she was working with me here all day. - Right. Right. - Bobby? - I miss him, Travis. I miss him. - Your daddy was a a good man. And a good sheriff too. - I just want to do him proud. You know, I just wanna. Damnit. How do you get rid of this feeling, Travis? - Things were different between me and my father. - Right. You be careful, Travis. These people don't seem to think too much about killin'. - Go home and get some sleep, Bobby. I'll call you if I hear anything. - Thanks, Travis. - Morning. - Morning. - I missed you last night. Sorry. You know about. - Whatever. - What are you doing? - You know you hurt her. Did you hear me, Travis? I said you hurt her. - [Travis] Come on, Jolene. What am I suppose to do? I told her I was sorry. - Bobby Jr's here. (dramatic music) - Shit. What's up? - We're covering the area. We narrowed it down to your property and the Salisbury's just north. Down to James parcel in the west. And the Del Ripple place across the way. - Wow, you think they're still around? - Yeah, we're pretty sure. - Bulldog Murphy saw a black car travelin' the harvest trail just a couple miles from where Sheriff Knight's deputy got run off the road. - No shit. - Yeah, they're here. They're hiding out somewhere. Listen, Travis. I'm gonna need you to take me around your place. Out to the lake. Your granddaddy's moonshine shack. Any place that you think they might be hidin'. - No problem. Can you hold on just a second? - Yeah. I'll be in the truck. Hurry up. - He wants to see the back point. He might want to come in here and look around. So hide everything. - Wait. Just in case. Good luck. - [Travis] How's the guard from the bank in Hurley? - Dead. He lost too much blood. You're awful quiet, Travis. Something you want to tell me? - Nope. - You sure? - Yep. - Come on, you did it. Didn't you, Travis? - Did what? - You doin' one of those girls, or what? - Well, you do what you can? - What you get? You get a little pussy you turn into an asshole. - I guess it's my turn now. You jealous? - Jealous? Hey look. There. (hard country music) Red. Red I got 'em. I'm in pursuit of the black lemon. Heading around the lake to the Graham property. Heading north. (police sires wailing) Get out. - What are you doing out here? - Well, you said to hide everything. - That didn't mean to move the car. - Well, I thought you guys were looking around on the other side of the lake. You almost got us caught. You almost fucked up everything. Idiot. - What you think we should have done left in the barn 'til these hillbilly cops done and looked there? - [Red] Repeat. Robbery suspects drivin' down by Mortimer. - Roger that. Red, we got 'em pinned down at Travis's and Del Ripple place. I'm sure of it. I'm gonna double check Travis's. You take the Del Ripples. Over. - Jolene. Come out now. I got rid of Bobby Jr. Jolene? (dramatic music) Estimated value $230,000 dollars. Samuel Graham died. Survived by only living relative, his son, Travis. Kelly! - What? - Sweetheart. Do you know anything about this? - About what? - Where's Jolene? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? You planned this all along, didn't you? (screams) (grunting) (gun shot fired) She was trying to rob me. But I caught her. Where is it? Why didn't you just steal it the first night you were here, huh? Now where's the fun in that? Oh. I can't. (groaning) Just shoot this bat with that brick. - Fuck you! You see around here folks will figure I'd be in my right. I could kill where you lay right now. Put that gun away, Kelly. Did you hear me, sweetheart? I said you can put that gun away. (police sirens wailing) How could you do that to you? - What? - Jesus. I told you. She had nothin' to do with those other robberies. - Then you're the driver. - [Red] We got 'em, Bobby. Over at the Del Ripple place. One suspect. ID'd as a Caucasian female driver. We need some layin' down on the robbery. Get over here. - The bank job in Hurley. That was her idea. That was your idea. - It was just for kicks. Shoot. You practically came in your pants. - You were the real fuck. - Do it, Kelly. - Put the gun down, Kelly. Just put the gun down. Put the gun down, sweetie. - Who's gun is that? Who's fucking gun is that? - The robber's she killed! - That's right. You little lucky chump. You were about to kill me. With a bullet in your head. For piece of plastic valium. He's coming back to the one that killed his daddy. And the guard in Hurley. Now. As far as I know. Kelly and I aren't suspects in those murders. If you catch my drift. I'm tired. Just shoot him, Kiki. - Kiki? - Nobody fucks with family. (gun shot fired) (melancholy music) - Here. - Sure you can travel? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just slow while drivin'. There you go. Always have to have a souvenir. Let's go. ("The Great Divide" by David Allan Morgan)
