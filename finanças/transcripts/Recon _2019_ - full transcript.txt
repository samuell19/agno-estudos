The Italians have quit and the Germans were retreating, giving way slowly. violently making us pay for every inch of ground. in time and in blood. For our patrols, snipers, landmines, but we went on anyway. putting one foot in front of the other. holding our rifles, trying in all our misery, confusion and exhaustion to remain watchful. if it wasn't the rain, it was the cold or the snow. All variations of the same thing. It was suffocating. And no matter how hard we tried, we just couldn't get enough air. We were somewhere near Cassino, but it was hard to believe this was even Italy anymore. So we kept on. Alone in the waste of the war. And we continued to be punished for it. She was with him. She would've shot us all if she could've. Like fuckin' dominoes. "Fuckin' dominoes"? I don't know who's crazier, him or the Nazis. Damn it, why do they always gotta look like they're asleep? What's the first thing you're gonna do when you...? What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get home? For me, it's gonna be Joe's Stone Crab. Been around for 30 years, Best dungeness. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I dunno... My old man told me one time in the first war, Oh, here we go. - What?! - Ignore him. Everybody listens to his bullshit. Come on, tell the story. All I was gonna say is that this one time he ran through 50 yards of gunfire just to get some chocolate. Yeah, and you believe that crap. - Fuckin' asshole. - 50 yards of Gerrys popping off rounds just to get a damn Hershey's bar. And don't look at me like that. Reminds me of my brother and that reminds me of home. And that just depresses the shit out of me. Halt! Don't fuckin' move. Hopewell. Walberg. Overturn that cart and make sure that there are no weapons or contraband. Go, go, go! I married the lady next door. A widow, no less. You know, her husband died. Slipped in the bath. No kidding, he fell he cocked his head. And that was that. He served us iced tea the afternoon that it happened. It doesn't just take war, you know? We're all in the crosshairs, that's all I'm sayin'. That and I don't think... a woman should have to die because she's got blood loyalty to her fuckin' lover. After the Krauts showed, Walberg and Hopewell.. We got 'em. Woman died in the crossfire. I need more than a dead soldier and his lover, Sergeant. I've got 20 men a day being killed by sniper fire. and word from above us and his Highness Churchill wants to know what the bloody holdup is. I understand. Well, if you do, son. Get the hell out there and get me some no-bullshit intelligence. Yes, sir. Jesus Christ. Hey. Some crossfire, huh? And we all heard that bullshit story Sarge told. You don't wanna talk about it. Fine by me. Makes it impossible to light a lady's cigarette. It's not nerves, though. Had it since I was 15. Now, this... This is fuckin' nerves. Never had anything like this before the war started. Fought it since Sicily, I just keep fuckin' diggin' at it. Thought Salerno was fucked up. I don't give a shit, what I tell you, you know what I mean? Here you go. Fuck you, Marson. Just trying to keep the peace? Is that it, Joyner? Did you try and stop him? I don't know. Never got the chance. - Wasn't what I asked you... - I said I don't know, okay? This... It's the end of times. Fuckin' end of the world. Fall in! Beautiful fuckin' freezing Italy. You know, I have no idea why my mom wants to visit here so bad. Smells like fuckin' Michigan to me. You okay, Corporal? Yeah, just got blisters, is all. Let's go. They call this a field jacket? What field? Fenway? Plus it doesn't keep you dry or warm, so... I don't know what the purpose is. Hey, I'm with you. - We gotta do somethin'. - Otherwise we. You're askin' me? Hey, Corporal, is it true what they say about your stripes? You got 'em chargin' a machine-gun nest, took out four Krauts all by yourself? Don't believe everything you hear. Yeah, don't I know that. My uncle's a police officer. He told me all kind of stories. He's a homicide detective. You ever wonder how someone could do that all those years? Just one murder after another? Never gave it any thought. There's a lot of 'em unsolved, too. Used to get kinda frustratin' for him. The one thing that he hated was when people saw something and wouldn't say what they saw. Still a lot of murderers walkin' these streets. Your uncle really a detective? Yeah, bet your ass, Heisman. That's good. When you get back home, Maybe he can solve that mystery as to why your balls haven't dropped. "Ha ha," says the guy who showers with a football and sleeps with his college ring under his pillow. Will you two keep your distance and shut up? Shit, Heisman, if I had your physique, I'd be playing for the Bears already. Oh ho! You think it's that easy? I miss football, so yeah, I kinda do. Fifty-one... Fifty-two, fifty-three... Quiet. Shut up. I swear to God, I will shoot you, Asch. Jesus fuckin' Christ, you are pathetic, soldier. It's not my fault, sir! - I was born with short arms! - Is that right? I'm like a crocodile, it runs in my family. Sergeant Reece, I'd like to, uh, request to finish my squad mate's pushups. Look, I'm afraid that Gerry see Asch, it only give 'em more encouragement to fight. Get the hell down there. Asch, get up. You are a fuckin' disgrace to this and every other outfit. Yes, sir. Hey! - Keep those arms straight, Heisman. - You fuck... Don't forget, you represent me now. Oh, do you ever shut up? No. I was on 24. - You got an answer? - I'm workin' on it. These are fresh. Maybe a day or so. They're Panzers, no doubt. Fuckin' perfect place for an ambush. Troutman? They want us to keep going forward. - Look to engage enemy patrols. - Good. Something's coming. Get ready! - It's just an old man! - Yeah, we'll see. - Do not move. Stop! - Sono Italiano. Shut up, you speak English? What is he saying? - What is he saying? - I don't know! Uh, he's saying he's our friend. Put the fuckin' cart down. Put the cart down. - Get away from the cart. - He's saying our friend. Don't shoot me! Please. Come here. - Please! - Shut up. Joyner, Troutman, on the cart. The rest of you, on the ready. You know this country? - Capisce? - Capisce Are there Germans ahead? - Si. - What is that, a fuckin' yes or a no? - Si. - You're gonna be okay. Shut up, Corporal! Can help you. Germans. Germans. Yes. Up the mountain. Up the fuckin' mountain? Germans up the mountain? - Si! - You guide! You show us where the Tedesco are. Si. I guide. I guide. You guide us up the mountain and show us where the Germans are. Si? - Si, si! - Tedeski. Si? - Io. I guide. Si. - Molto, many? Many Germans? Marson, you lead. Take Asch, Joyner, and Heisman with you. He's saying, "Many Germans." We have no idea the size of the force. Just stick to the fuckin' trees. Give us Troutman, we'll radio back. No. I need him here with me. A nice long walk... it has a way of settling things for men. Let's go, the rest of you on me. Si, si. Heisman, Joyner, Asch. Let's go. Walk long. Big mountain. Oh! Fuck... You okay? Yeah, just ask my lady when I get home. How 'bout that? Why us? I'll tell you why us. Fuck! Ah! Thanks, Heisman. Shit's sakes, Asch. What are you, fucking retarded? I feel like a kid again. You look like an asshole. Fuck you. Fuckin' Yid. You wanna keep those opinions to yourself, Joyner? Why? Mr. All American? You're gonna kick my ass? Careful now. With this chain, you get the whole fuckin' dog. They're gonna find chunks of you in my shit. - You have really pretty eyes. - Stand down, both of you! That's an order! We're on a mission. Really? What precisely would that be? You know damn well what. I'd rather be back at basecamp. I dunno, Joyner. You might get lucky and find a friendly goat up here. Says Cary Grant. Asch, you been with anybody besides your left hand? Well, let's see. Uh, there was your ma, your aunt, Your sister twice if you factor in daylight savings time. I'll kill you. Hey, you started it. Let's go. I'll say it again. We just know too damn much. That a fact, Philip Marlowe? Complicated by the fact that the... Sergeant knows the Corporal and I adhere to a strict set of morals. Be quiet, Asch, you don't know anything about me. Yes, I do. You come from money. Yeah, what makes you say that? You went to college. Private college, that takes money. You read Nietzsche which in turn means you got morals and free time. That takes money. Bright guy. Well, you New York boys so bright... What "boys," Joyner? Do you want to give me a more specific category? Because last time I checked, I happen to be born in Boston. - You know what category. - You have no idea. Why don't you just man up and fill us the fuck in? Enough! Now let's get something straight. We are going up this hill and we're gonna see what we see. Then we're turning around and coming back down and we're not spending anymore energy fighting each other. Do you got it? Just tell him to lay the fuck off. No! I'm not getting in between you anymore. I'm telling you how it's gonna be! Fine. Sarge wants to dump all you. I get that. But why me? Well, because apparently, He hates you, too. And fuck you! No matter what you're talkin' about. What did he say? He wants us to die choking on our own blood. He's a fuckin' fascist, I'm tellin' you. Keep your mouth shut, Joyner! - Fuckin'... - Shut your mouth! Don't open it again unless it's to breathe. Let's go! I just got off a fuckin' farm. And now, I'm back in farm country. In fuckin' Italy! Beautiful fuckin' Italy. Hey did I ever tell you about my grandfather? Yeah, but you can tell me again. It's a good story. My mother's father grew up in Germany. Very proud of his country. World War I comes along, he's in his late 30s, he goes off and fights with honor for the Kaiser. He even gets a medal or something. After the war, he gets out, and he comes to America so he can make a better... make a better life for his family. Last year, he dies in the living room of an apartment in Brockton, Massachusetts, after eatin' a meal of salmon and dill sauce that his daughter-in-law cooked for him. Guess where she came from? Italy! So the man had been in the first World War fightin' on the other side, in the Ardennes Forest, shooting the French and English and American soldiers to an apartment in Brockton with a grandson about to join the Army to go fight the Hun. The whole thing's pretty fuckin' ridiculous, wouldn't you say? I don't care to say. Fuck, that looks cold. Now what? Looks empty. We'll be wide open for sniper fire crossin' that thing. Our alternative? A couple hours around, at least? Cross the bridge. Bridge sicuro, safe. Nice fuckin' try, Judas. Yeah. For once in my life, I have to agree. Yeah. It looks like we gotta turn back. We're not turning back. Corporal. While we're hopscotching across that thing, his Kraut pals can pick us off one at a time. - I'll go first. - No. He does. - Si. - Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got a pack of Lucky Strikes says he goes belly up. - Shut up. - I'll take that action. Where did you get Lucky Strikes? Come on, you big bastard. He is one nimble son of a bitch. Why don't you just marry the guy already? You know, Joyner, the more I hang out with you, the more I understand the Germans' point of view on eugenics. Now where are my Lucky Strikes? Yi. Yeah... Hey, it's just like a ride at Coney Island. Yeah, just like it! Nibble on a goal post, you Neanderthal. - Shit! - Hey, it's okay! Keep moving, buddy! Okay! Okay! - Fuck! Shit! Shit! Shit! - You okay, Asch? Keep moving. You got it, buddy! That a kid! Ah, fuck! Feel free to jump if you want, Joyner! Shut the fuck up, Asch! Jesus Christ! Oh, fuck! You like the show, you old fuck? Jesus Christ. Hey, Heisman. This is Coney Island, where's my Nathan's hot dog? I got your hot dog right here. - Heisman! - Heisman! - Go, go, go! - Heisman, fuck! Your ring! Ah! My ring! My fuckin' ring! My ring! My fuckin' ring! Come on! I'll get it! - My fucking ring! - I'll get it! What the fuck... give the fucking morphine! Corporal! Corporal! Asch! Asch, what the hell are you doing?! Asch, get your ass back here! Ah! Okay. Ten more lousy... Fucking feet! Fuck! Fuck! Oh! Oh. I got it! Heisman! I got it! I got it! Heisman! Heisman! I got it, buddy! Heisman! Heisman! Heisman! I got it, buddy. Hey! - Heisma--Fuck you, you coulda got us all killed! We're cursed! We're fuckin' cursed! 'Cause the God damn whore! Fuck! That much noise if there are Germans, they've been hearing us, They're comin' this way. We'll stick to the riverbank and head south. We're headin' south, Asch. What?! We're just gonna leave him here? We don't have a choice! We have to move! Pops wants to get us somewhere real fast, that's for sure. He fuckin' knew. You see this?! This is on you! This is on you! Oh... what...? Get your shit, we're goin'! What is your name? What are you called? I'm Robert Marson. You're... your name? Angelo. Angelo. Were you in the Army, Angelo? Si. Uh... Prima guerra mondiale. The first war. Si, si. Did you fight? You know, fight? Si, si. Io ero capitano. - You were a Captain. - Si. The fuck is that? It's a soldier. He's wearing our colors! He's one of ours! "Shaw" I don't know, an... Single shot. Sniper? - Looks that way. - Fuckin' great! Now we got the Red Baron after us. He's been dead a while. Yeah. He's frozen solid. The hell's he doin' all the way out here? He's probably tryin' to go home. Shut up, Asch! Let's go. Angelo! - On me! - Bene. Move out. Come on! Fuck! I remember when I was 12 years old, I saw my first fist fight. These two teenagers just goin' at it, boxing back and forth. The one guy... comin' at the other, he had this... thin line of blood around his mouth. I'll never forget the sound of their fists hitting each other's faces. They must've been in that dance for a mile or so. And I followed them. Every single step. Good for you. What the fuck are you tellin' me for? I was fascinated. Sounds it. That's fuck'... That's fuckin' amazing. What's amazing? Ah, just the Corporal. Jesus. Look... If we don't do anything... we're just as guilty as Reece is. Are you forgetting Hopewell and Walberg got killed? She didn't do anything... but yell. And die. There's nothing we can do about it now. Can you please stop talking about her? The longer that we wait... The worse it's gonna be. You got a radio? Didn't think so. We are going to finish this mission. Yeah, the suicide mission you mean. Corporal, I don't buy that he can't understand a single word we're sayin'. Thanks. He's leading us into a Nazi regiment. We're lost. I fuckin' guarantee you. I'll tell you when we're lost. You'll tell me when I'm lost? We're gonna lose daylight. Let's move out. We could be anywhere up this fucker. It'll be three miles back up the road, you know it. Yeah, three miles above the road, I know that. Oh, shit. How much farther, Angelo? Not far. This son of a bitch is lying. Shut up, Joyner. You know... I used to swim in a lake like this... in the summertime in Sharon, Mass. Move out. You guys are... good Christians? You believe in an angry God is interested in payback, right? "Vengeance is mine," all that stuff. Well, I think we're gonna pay for... earlier. In fact, - I think we might be paying for it right now. You're so full of shit! Shut the fuck up. Let it go! Besides, it's our religion. We're the ones goin' to hell, not you. Yeah, I'm not even gonna answer that. Christ, Joyner, the way your mind works... Talk about it back at base. Thing is, Corporal, can't get the image of her legs out of my head. All right, let's move out. Shh! Leave him be. This is his land. - We're trespassing on it. - Jesus Christ. There's no end to this shit. We'd be in fuckin' Switzerland by now. Si. Yeah, you understood that, didn't ya? Fuck! Oh, fuck. - Anybody hit? - No, I'm good. Some gun! - If that was a branch breakin', it fell off a Mauser tree. - You sure? That was a shot. Of course with this one, I'd know what the fuckin' bullet sounds like. It was far away, a long way away, right? Yeah, tell yourself whatever you want. I can't tell this as this height. Sound carries farther the higher you go, doesn't it? Fuck. What the hell? What the fuckin' hell? We're goin' up the brow, the Devil himself. One more word from you like that, Joyner, I'll shoot you myself. Hey, fuck you, Marson, okay? By all the rights, I should be in charge anyway. If it wasn't for your college degree. Mussolini here has led us to our deaths. Shut up! Okay. He has not. And Marson's in charge. This is all fucked! - This is all fucked! - Okay. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. - I'm gonna get up really slowly and we're gonna start movin'. - Yeah. - Keep your eyes up, all right? - Hell, yeah. Here we go. Over there. It's a party. Cover me. What the fuck? Peace. Soul. Maybe Tedeski. Have soul. I hope. That's just like Shaw. Look at the wound. I want off this fuckin' mountain. This whole thing is fucked. Fire's still burning, There's footprints all around. The Germans did it. Why shoot their own guy? Desertion. They're not trying to hide that they're here. Either they're running or... they don't know we're here. Or... they're leading us into a trap. Tedesco. Si. Tedesco. The fuck you saying to him? - Word means "German." - Well, do us a favor and talk English, will ya? Fuck. Take it easy. It's just a wolf calling. They're laughing at us. It's just a wolf calling. We didn't see any tracks leading in here. We made contact. Which means we can turn around and start making our way off this fucker. How many men you think, Asch? I don't know. - Ten? - Way more than ten if you ask me. Think they knew we were coming? What exactly are you suggesting we do? They don't know about us so they don't care about us. I don't think they know. We'll wait a little bit. If they're running, we'll give them a little head start. And if they come back, we'll be ready for them. Christ, you don't think they're gonna come back, do you? Keep your eyes up. It blew like this in Africa. Except it was sand. I'd rather have the sand. I prefer the sand. I made up my mind, I'm reportin' what happened. Christ. Once again, Mr. Broken Record. I'm reportin' it. That's all I'm sayin'. Can't go the rest of my life carryin' this. What made you the moral compass of the fuckin' Fifth Army? The sergeant did. The minute that he shot that girl... I say we talk about it when we get down. We're not there yet. I'll come with you when the time comes. Jesus, you're both fucked. Need I remind you that two of our guys got it when her lover jumped out of that cart. Yeah, she didn't do the shooting. She was a fuckin' Nazi. They don't like Jews. It's your people, isn't it? You know what, Joyner? You're a Nazi. Say that again. You're... a Nazi. Say that again, you little piece of shit. You're a fuckin' Nazi. Stop it! Stop it! Back the fuck off, Joyner! Not one more inch, Joyner. You hear me? Get your fuckin' finger out of my face. I mean it! 'Cause otherwise, we're no different than they are. You gotta have the last word, don't ya? Take it away, asshole! I'm not sweatin' it... I'm gonna tear my fuckin' skin off, cut it away. Bah! You know more English than you're lettin' on, huh? I bet you know what's on the other side of this mountain we're trying to fuckin' climb. We know what's on the other side of the mountain, it's a fuckin' war! I'm just sayin' we shouldn't trust him. I do for my country. I've only known they made it out of shit. Yeah. You realize this guy could be part of the Axis, right? He's at least, what? 65? Which means he was around for Albania. And all of the Africa stuff at the beginning. Ethiopia. All that. "Ethiopia"? What the fuck are you talkin' about, Joyner? This shit goes back ten years or more, man. These guys have been fighting for a long time. I'm sure some of them are sick of it. I... had a family. Tutti morti. Dead. Jesus. Why don't we send up a flare and sing the "Star Spangled Banner"? Shit. Near. Jesus. If he says that one more fuckin' time I'm gonna shoot him myself. What the hell was that? Planes? No, tanks. Christ. Up here?! - Si. - Near? Si. God. Let's go, Asch. - Asch, help him! - All right. Joyner, get up! What the fuck are you doing? Joyner! Joyner, get your shit, take your gear, let's go! Shoot me! Asch, help him! Shoot me. Shoot me. For Christ's sweet sake, Joyner, come on. Gotta get off this fucker. - This is shit. This fuckin' shit. - Get your weapon. We gotta get off this fuckin' mountain. It's a terrible place. Joyner. Hey. Hey. Benny. Let's just finish this. And get back. Okay? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Joyner! I wanna go home. Joyner, we're goin' on. Okay? Let's go. Come on. Okay? Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Capisce? Capisce! Come on. Let's go. Your village? Si. Mio village. Amici. Friends? Si. Corporal. It's a fucking firing squad. What are you gonna report now? I'm gonna report a murder. - Even after this? - Yeah, especially after this, damn it. Maybe the soldiers... - are executing members of the resistance. - No. Shooting innocent. Oh, God. This is worse. The silence. They're gonna attack. Yeah, no more babies to kill. Might as well take on the big boys. We gotta move. I can't fuckin' believe this. Any of this bullshit. All fuckin' offensive. What's that for? So the dead know we're here. Let's move out. Let's get the fuck out of here. You know, Corporal, maybe Reece... Where'd it come from?! I don't know! The kick-behind is way off! A sniper?! It's a sniper! You sure?! Stay out until at least they saw! - Don't you move! - Why?! If he knows you're alive, he'll shoot you again! Fuck. Oh, shit. There's somebody behind me. I hear footsteps. You heard nothing! What if they're working their way around us? They're not working their way around! There's only been one shot! Which means it's a sniper! Si. Un cecchino. Okay, I'm coming for you, so you take it easy, all right...? No, no, no, no, no, Corporal, they'll be out there waiting for you! I'm not gonna leave him! Hey, fuck you! I didn't say that! Saul! Okay, Asch, you ready? I'm comin' for you. Okay! Joyner, you cover me, all right?! I'm makin' a move! He saw what he saw. You cover me! He's been watching us this whole time. Cover me, Joyner! All right, fuck! All right. Covering fire! Moving! Run! - Saul! - Shit! Fuck! Move! I can't feel my fuckin' leg. You know I can just leave you here, right? Come on, Joyner... How's it lookin'? Oh, shit! It's okay, it's okay. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Is it bad? - No, million dollar wound. - Don't bullshit me. Through and through. You're gonna be okay, I don't think it hit any bone. Okay? It's gonna be okay. - You're gonna be okay. - Okay. - Okay, do me a favor. - Yeah. Put your hands here. Keep pressure on there. Keep pressure on there. Don't take that off. - Okay?! - I'm freezin'. It's so fuckin' cold. Oh. Shit, it's not stoppin'. - It's stoppin'. - I'm emptyin' out. Move your hands, move your hands, move your hands. It's okay. - It's okay, here we go, here we go. - I didn't do anythin'. I'm a good guy, I never hurt nobody on purpose, I swear. - Hey, hey, hey... - I got... - Hey, look at me! - Mm-hmm. It's gonna be okay, all right? We're gonna patch you up. We're gonna get you off this mountain. And out of this fuckin' war. - Okay? - Okay. - I'm scared. - It's okay, it's okay. - This is bad, isn't it? - No, it's not. It's stopping. It's stopping It's cold. Cold is good. It's a good sign. No, it's bad. Give me some... I need something for the pain. - Just give me something... - Okay, okay, okay. Shh... Give me another one. Oh, it hit me... I didn't mean anything... I'm sorry for the noise. You're gettin' out of this war, you lucky son of a bitch. Look, Benny, there's so much blood. Yeah, well... You've got gallons of it. There's enough, you know? Benny, I got it all over me. It's okay. Hmm? You ever donate blood? You take a vial of that, you spill it on the floor, it looks exactly like that. We were screwed from the... from the beginning. Got your blanket here. It's okay. Jump in there. There you go. - Joyner. - Yeah? Joyner, I can't feel my legs. I can't move my legs. - Can you feel that? - Feel what? I can't feel my legs. Christ. It'll go away, it'll go away, okay? Soon as we get your blood pressure back up, - it's gonna come back, okay? - Okay. Where's the toothpaste? Somebody took the toothpaste. I got it, buddy. - You got it. - Yeah. - Yeah! You're a good brother. - Yeah. You're a good brother. I should've given you a baseball glove. Don't worry about it, okay? You should've seen the things I saw. That's her... I can't... breathe... It's okay. It's okay. - Shh. - Shh. Breathe. I don't know if there's any internal bleeding. Bullet might've perforated his bowel. Father... Father... - Father... - We gotta move him. - Okay, okay, I'll carry him. - No. No, he's mine. Put your hat on, okay? - I'll sit you up, okay? - Okay. You ready? Three... two... One. There we go. Get him. Three... two... Stand up, stand up. Okay. You're gonna be all right, buddy. Keep going, I got the stuff. Go, go, go. Let's go. Okay, buddy. There you go. You know you can pick us off at any time, right? They sent stragglers. Maybe he shot once and it went over through a tree. Yeah. Or he could be fuckin' huntin' us. It's not so bad. The cold. And the wind's not blowin'. There's somethin' out there. There's someone you mean. Hey. Why don't we set the Kraut up as one of us with a rifle? You know, like, prop him up against the tree or somethin'? That way if the sniper's on our tail, he might take a pop at the dead guy. Give us a warning. Got no one to cover us. You really want to take that chance? If I can get rid of the feeling that somebody's put a bead on me the whole way down this fuckin' mountain. Then yeah. Fuck yeah, I want to take the chance. - Okay. - Yeah? Okay. Angelo! Get down! Oh. Hey, buddy. Hey, okay. There you go. -Now, now, now, yeah. We're setting up a decoy. Not yet, buddy. Huh? I'm bleedin', okay? - Inside, I can feel it. - No. Your imagination. - No. - You're fine. Final push. Then get you out here, okay? I'll carry you myself. Get you home. Have a nice fuckin' beer. Go for a burger. All that shit. Can you eat meat? You people eat meat? - A steak? Can you do that? - Is it kosher? It's all good. - It's gonna be fine, okay? - Okay. What do you think? Yeah... maybe. From far away? I guess. Fuck. He looks like a fuckin' stiff tied to a tree. - It was your idea. - I know! Maybe from a distance. Looks like a fuckin' mannequin. We... no time. We hurry. Saliva's gathering at the back of his throat. We gotta move him. You go. I'm gonna stay and get this bastard. No. We get down off this fucker. - All of us, together... - We don't have any time. He's gonna get us on the way down, one by one, and you know it. We don't know that. Let Angelo take you down, don't you stop for a second. And, Joyner, get him home. I got a bad feelin'. You always got a bad feeling. Fuck you, too, Corporal. There's something you need to know. If you do anything... that'll lead your German buddies here to us, I'll fuckin' kill you myself... Before I ever take a shot at them. Understand? I... got you. - You trust me. - No. I don't trust you. I said it from the start. You hate us, don't you? You fascist pig. No, grazie. A kid? A thief?!

I can feel the blood going out of me. No, you're not. You're just imagining it, all right? No, I... I don't have an imagination anymore. I'm all facts. Ask me anything. Ask me if I'm gonna die. You're not gonna die. Save your strength. We're almost there. We'll make it, you'll see. Do you ever go to serials back home? - Movie houses? - Yup. Saturday matinee. All day for a nickel.

Hey! Hey! That's enough! You're all murderers. Get him the hell out of here. Want to tell me what happened, Corporal? Sergeant Reece, sir. He's a murderer. He killed an innocent. Sergeant Reece is dead. Died an hour ago from a wound. Sniper shot him through his throat. Someone search the old man. Did you get a view from up north? Doesn't make a difference anymore, does it? What doesn't? Who we tell. Son, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Now pull yourself together and tell me what you saw! Counterattack. Jesus Christ. A large force heading our way. We found this on him, sir. You son of a bitch. Take him into the woods down by the river and shoot him. What?! - What?! - You heard me. No, sir. Are you questioning me, Corporal? Sir, you can't mean it. Two men from this outfit were shot by a German officer. Four others got it last night by Italians acting like people happy to be liberated. You lost men to the same action. Well, some of them are still in this. And this one is carrying around scouting information on us. These people know the penalty for spying. He got us where we needed to go. Yeah. He kept his word. Yeah, until we're overrun today and he goes back to scouting for them. Take care of it. No, sir. - He's not one of them, sir. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Are you gonna do this, or do I have to? - Stop, no...! - Get your hands off me, Corporal! I got him. He's my prisoner. Then take him into the woods and do it. Now. Go. Go! Go! Move! Stop. You did this to yourself. What? You... weep for the girl. You... feel... Sin. We all sinners. I... I pray for you. Ave Maria. I... I curse you! You curse me?! Yes! I curse you! - You curse me?! - I curse you! - You curse me?! - I curse you! - You curse me?! - I curse you! My mama give me. Long time ago. Before she died. Go! Go! Go! Get the hell out of here! Go! Go before I change my fucking mind! You mother... You mother... You motherfucker. Corporal. I thought you were supposed to kill him. There's not much a 70-year-old man can do to change the war. Hey. Asch was right. We were fucked the moment we shot the whore. You know they're gonna court-martial you for this if they find out. You hear that? What? It's peace. Hey! You're feeling okay? What are you talking about? All of this. What? All of this. Hey. You feeling all right? Okay. Okay, wait here, wait here. Let me get somebody. Corporal! Let's go, we're movin' out! I wanted to stay by that river... I'm not fuckin' around, come on! Lie down... And let the war go on without me. I had no prayers left to say. But every moment after that... for the rest of my life... I would need to know... Why? SIX MONTHS LATER WHILE ON RECON PATROL ROBERT MARSON WAS GRAVELY WOUNDED BY A MORTAR ROUND.
