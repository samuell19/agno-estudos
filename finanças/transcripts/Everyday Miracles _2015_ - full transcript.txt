He said he's got a stallion that they're having trouble with and he was wondering if you might take a look at him? - Oh, well, I don't know. - [Clay] It sure would help him out. - All right, then, I'll see what I can do. - Uh, there's some cobbler in the oven for dessert and do you need anything else before I go? - [Clay] No, no, Max, that's fine. - All right, I'm sorry I didn't have time to clean up. Momma needs a prescription from the drug store before it closes and they got those new hours. - No, no, don't worry about it, go. - So, all right. - Thanks for the fine meal. - Uh, yeah, thank you. - Thanks, Max. - Yeah, well you know I love cookin' for ya.

You tell 'em I send my best. - I will. How's your momma? - Oh, well she's just in a poor, horrible state, got the bursitis. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's a trial but she perseveres. Colitis, bursitis and the devil beside us. - Well, I'll keep her in my prayers. - Thank you, that's sweet. - Nadine, this is Cotton Wells. - Oh, I know. (Max laughs) - Hi, Maxine. - Hi, Tommy. - How's your momma? - Fine, thank you. - [Tommy] That's good. - Why is everybody lookin' at us? - Uh, well you can't blame 'em because everybody wants to see the new horse whisperer that Clay's got up in his ranch. You are a celebrity. Hi, Melinda, Bobby. - [Bobby] Hey, Nadine, how you doin'. - Billy Johnson, you're gonna get that finger stuck in there and then what are ya gonna do? Now turn around. - You must know everybody in town? - Yeah, pretty much. (laughs) I've lived here my whole life. Never set foot out of this town until I was in high school and only then on the senior trip. We went to the state capitol. - How was it? - Not all that much. I used to think about leavin' here, but then my daddy passed away and my momma was all alone. But besides, I don't really know where I'd go and everybody I've ever known is right here. So I don't think I'd know who I was if I left. So what about you, Cotton Wells, where are you from? - Well that's hard to say. We moved around so much, I don't really know. - Well I hope you stick around for a little while, give us a little time to figure you out. - Figure me out? - Oh, it's all right, I like a little mystery, just not too much. (laughs) (laughs) Do you know what time it is? - (sighs) I don't know, after seven? - Do you like hot dogs? - I guess. - All right, let's go. - Where? - Some place with a little privacy. Nadine, tell Carl to throw that trout back in the river. - You sure? - Yes. (laughs) (whistle blares) (crowd cheers) (feet pounding) (crowd cheers) Thank you. - You call this private? - Yeah, just like you're invisible.

(door creaks) (birds chirping) (Cotton hums) (guitar thrums) - It was my son's. He spent a whole summer working down at Freeman's just to buy it. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- - No, no, no, it's, it's okay, it's good. It'd be a shame to just have it sittin' in the corner gatherin' dust. - Oh, thank you. It's a beauty. - He never got much good at it, I'm afraid. (sighs) (somber music) He died in a car accident, wife, too. A drunk driver just swerved right into 'em, never saw it coming. - I know, your little girl told me. - She did? She never talks to me about 'em. - Well she tries to protect you. - I suppose that's true. Well, (sighs) it's just been the two of us since they died. Well of course, Max comes over a few days a week to help us with the house and cook our meals. (sighs) But, you know. You got any family? - (sighs) Well, yeah. My daddy's dead, but (coughs) my momma, she's still alive. Oh, I got a sister, but I haven't seen her in a while. - [Clay] You ever been married? - No, sir, I haven't. - Well, it's a true blessing when you find the right person. It makes you whole and when it's not there anymore, well. (sighs). (Cotton hums) (gentle music) That's nice. - Thank you. It's really a beautiful guitar. - [Emily] Pa, come on. - (sighs) Well, you heard her, she's the boss. Come on. (Cotton laughs) - [Emily] Come on. - [Clay] Harrison, let's go. (box thuds) (tailgate slams) Where you been, little lady? - [Emily] Just ridin'. - Max needs your help inside. - Okay. Did the old man come see Cotton? - What man? (suspenseful music) - [Emily] The old man with the big car. He said he was a friend of Cotton's. - What'd he want? - I don't know. He gave me somethin', it's for Cotton. (paper crinkles) (crickets chirp) - [Clay] So you want to tell me about it? - (sighs) Ain't much to tell. It's all a long time ago. - (sighs) Look, son, you may be too young to realize this, but the past has a way of catchin' up to ya if you don't put it to rest. What is that thing? - It's a flyer. (sighs) For a revival. - Who would give you somethin' like that? (somber music) - Well, I guess I never told you this but my daddy was a preacher. We used to travel around the circuit, my momma, my sister and me. Preachin' the good news, passin' around the collection plate to make ends meet. - [Clay] Um-hmm, I see. - It was all goin' fine until things started to happen. - [Clay] What sort of things? - Strange things, like, well like the horses back there and others. - Like what? - The healin's. The first one was a girl, a cripple, came to my pa for a blessin'. Durin' the service I, I don't know, I was up there singin', letting the music fill me like a dream and I just went to her and I laid my hands on her. - You healed her? - Well she could walk in that very moment. And my daddy, he wanted to keep it all real quiet and, my momma, though, "A miracle of faith," is what she called it, "a blessed gift from God." Of course it wasn't bad for the collection plate, either. - I see. - And pretty soon people started showin' up lookin' for help. Sick people, desperate people willin' to do anything. Made up the whole world until it killed my daddy, hardened my momma and had my sister cryin' every night. - So you ran away? - As fast and far as I could until, well until now. - Well, (sighs) that's quite a tale. - Well it's the truth, I swear. - Oh, I don't doubt it.

You oughta let that go, you don't wear it well. - What do you want? - I don't want anything, Cotton. Quite the opposite, for I bring great tidings, a gift. - A gift, what kind of gift? - [Maggie Mae] Oh, the greatest gift of 'em all, forgiveness. - Forgiveness, for what? - [Maggie Mae] For the harm you caused, all the pain. Took some doin', but I worked it all out. I made a deal with that family in Shepard and that boy and the police. All that trouble, it's all a thing of the past. Momma made all the bad men go away. - That it? - Is that it? I don't think you understand what I'm sayin'. You can come back. You can come home. We can be a family again. - A family. - [Maggie Mae] If you want it. You want it, doncha? - Of course not. I didn't leave because of the trouble, I left 'cause of you. - Oh, I see. I see. So why on earth are you here? - Why do you think? - Your sister. - I want to see her. - Do you honestly think I'd let you hurt her again? - I'm not gonna hurt her. - Oh such kindness. Hey, Davis, did you realize I raised such a kind boy? Where was all that kindness all those years ago when you left? - Maggie Mae, maybe he could help with the-- - Hush, you, I will handle this. That little girl cried herself to sleep every night, prayin' for answers that never came. Wonderin' where her Cotton was. Was he lonely, was he hurt, lyin' on a road dead somewhere. - I left to protect her. - Whatever helps you sleep at night, darlin', but you and I both know the truth. You left for your own selfish reasons, self, self, self. - Yeah well all you ever cared about was that collection plate. - You ungrateful child. Sharper than a serpent's tooth, ooh. After all I did for you? God gave you a gift, a blessed, beautiful gift and you squandered it. You threw it away. You threw your whole life-- - I won't. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, run.

I can see ya, you know. It doesn't work unless there's a game on. You okay? - She wants me to go back. - [Max] Oh. - But I don't know if I can do it. - Then don't. Just stay here, forget about all that. - I wish I could. I just been sittin' here thinkin' about her. Back then she and I were all we had, travelin' around the circuit with Momma.

Please. - I can't. I can't heal. Maybe I could before, but I can't anymore. - [Audience Member] We know you can do it. Help her, please. - Please, my girl is sick. - Please, help us. - Please help my wife - Help us, Cotton, please. - My son is dying, help him. - Hallelujah. - Amen.

(sighs) It's too bad. - [Cotton] Why is that? - I miss seein' ya everyday. - Well you don't have to. - [Max] What are you talkin' about? - All right, look. I know it ain't much, but I was hopin' you'd be my wife. - Oh. Um. - Is that a yes? - Yes. Yes. (laughs) Yes. (laughs) Yes. Yes, you fool, yes. (couple laughs) Let me see it. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh. (ominous music) (suitcases clatter) (door creaks) - Where have you two been? - We'd thought you'd be down at the tent all day. - I know what you thought. Where you been all afternoon? - Well we took a drive. She wanted to go out-- - Oh, that's nice. - And get some fresh air. - You two go out for a nice long drive and you leave me to handle the packin' up of the tent. - [Davis] I'm sorry, I didn't notice the time. - No, no, everything's always in my basket. Everything firmly placed in my lap. Well God helps those who help themselves, I guess. He better, 'cause I ain't gettin' any help from you two. - [Davis] Come here, Maggie, why don't-- - See why, do I do it? Hmm, why do I do it? Scrape together enough money to pay the band, try to put a roof over your heads and for what? So you two can go out joyriding. - Come on-- - Do you think it's easy what I do? It's a miracle. I'm the miracle. (glass clatters) - [Jeanie] Momma. - [Maggie Mae] Just leave it. What you gonna do, step on it? Just leave it alone. (feet shuffling) (moans) (Davis sighs) - It's all right, she just needs to rest. Why don't you go down and see if you can help the guys pack up. - Okay. You sure? - Yeah, it's fine. I'll stay here with her. (door slams) (somber music) (chair creaks) (door creaks) (Maggie moans) (ominous music) (engine hums) (brakes squeal) (door slams) - Hello. - [Max] Cotton, someone's here to see you. - Jeanie? (ominous music) - What's the matter, cat got your tongue? (lighter clicks) - What are you doin' here? - [Maggie Mae] We have to talk. - There's nothin' to talk about. - Oh, I think there is and it'll just take a minute. Surely you have a minute for the woman who brought you into this world? - I'm gonna go make some of the beds. - No, you don't have to go. - [Max] No, it's fine. You stay here and talk. - Pretty girl. - What is it? - I want you back. Back on the circuit. - You're insane. - Am I? Well I still want you back. - For what? I can't heal anybody. - It worked, you healed her. Jeanie, (laughs) she can walk. - I don't believe you. - I know, I could barely believe it myself. I thought you were all washed up, but I saw it with my own two eyes. - No, I didn't. I couldn't. You were there. - Lies, all lies and deception. See at first, I thought you'd be in on it, but see now, I really don't think you were. Oh, that sister of yours, she can put on a pretty good show, but that is not the kind of thing you can keep up. (laughs) - Even if that were true, what makes you think I'd come back? I've built a life for myself. - (laughs) A life? You don't belong here. You are different than these people. - It's not true. They're my family. - Oh come on, Cotton, I mean really. What are you gonna do, live out here playin' Farmer Jones? Hiding your light from under a bushel. See you need to be in the light, hmm? With people who know you. People who understand your special gifts and know how to use them. So you just come home. - Home? I remember the sorta home you made for us. Draggin' me around the circuit like some sort of freak show. You never loved us. You did horrible things to us. All you ever cared about was that collection plate. - Cotton, that's all anybody ever cares about. What, are you surprised by your mother's honesty? Well I'm gonna do you one better. See, things are a little tight right now. In fact, I really don't know what we're gonna do if you don't come back. I don't. Your sister needs you, I need you, your real family needs you, so you just come home. Come on, come to Momma. (laughs) (ominous music) (boots shuffling) - Get out. - Come on, Cotton. You know maybe I wasn't the perfect mother, but I loved you. Maybe not in the way you wanted, when you wanted, but oh I sacrificed for you and for Jeanie. - Just go-- - I sacrificed for both of you, so you are just comin' home. - Momma, this is my home. - What do you want from me? - Nothin'. (somber music) - When I was a little girl that man took somethin' from me. He took it. And all the beauty and all the sunshine in all the world, it just went away. My God, Cotton, it just went away. And now, the only time that I feel the presence of God is when you are onstage performing your miracles. That is the only time that I feel God and I need a miracle in my life. I need you, Cotton. I do. And you have no idea how bad. You have no idea. - I don't believe you. (Maggie Mae laughs) - All right, well there's no reason you really should. Yeah, there's no reason at all. - [Cotton] Please, just go. - Okay, listen, you, put your hands down. (objects clatter) Put 'em down. You just wait, you'll see. You don't think they're gonna turn away from you, huh? Just like everybody else. When the wolves come snarlin' at the door, blood is all that matters. And you listen to your heart because that is my blood running through your veins and by God Almighty, Cotton, it is that blood that is going to bring you home again. I swear to you. (door slams) (Cotton gasps) (hopeful music) - Carried out just like today, beautiful, sunny. Then the clouds came in. You should have seen it. - Hun, can you help me? Thank you, thank you. - Oh, it's beautiful. Look, pumpkin, look. Isn't that lovely. (women gasp) - Thank you. (bridesmaid laughs) (fist raps) (door creaks) - Lookin' good, how do you feel? - Good. - You're getting quite a girl. - Yes, sir, I know it. - I know she couldn't be in safer hands. I, (laughs) I know I should probably wait 'til after the ceremony, but it's just, I can't. (paper rustles) That's a piece of land. Actually, it's a piece of my land. Right behind the stable. It'll get you started. Build yourself a home. - We can't. - No, no, don't say it. (sighs) It's as much for me as it is for you. This way at least I know where you both are. Family should stick together. (fist raps) - Cotton, you got a phone call. - [Cotton] Who is it? - I don't know, they wouldn't say. - Maybe it's Jeanie. - Well go see. Go on. (hands pat) (women murmur) - Cotton, no. - Get out of here. (door creaks) (shoes pounding) - Hello. - Well we got married in the church, but yeah, it's the same. - No shower there. - Yeah, they're probably lookin' down from Heaven. - Yeah, probably. I want cake. - I know, just hold your horses. We're gonna get started. Cotton, what is it? (somber music) - She couldn't have. - [Clay] What, who was on the phone? - Look, it's Jeanie. I gotta go, tell Max-- - Daddy. - Don't worry, honey. We'll be right back. - [Emily] Max. - [Clay] Hey, Cotton, hold on, I'll drive. Get in. (suspenseful music) (doors slam) (engine roars) (tires squeal) (radio murmurs) It's all right, it's all right, he's family. (ominous music) - (sobbing) Oh, Cotton, she drank somethin'. Maggie Mae put somethin' in her food. She didn't mean it, Cotton. She couldn't mean somethin' like that. (sobs) - He's come home. I knew you'd come for her. They told me that you were comin' for her. You can't let anything happen to her. Not to my baby girl, okay. So you'll heal her, Cotton, okay? Like Lazarus from the grave. You'll heal my baby. - What did you do? - Oh, my darling boy. - What did you do to my sister? (Maggie gasps) What did you do? - [Clay] Come here. - No, you're my boy. (Cotton gasps) Shh. Shh. (somber music) - Please, God, please, God. - (sobs) No, no, wake up. Wake up. He can save her. He can perform miracles. He has the gift. No. He's just doin' this to spite me. God's gifts were wasted on you. It should have been me. No. No, Jeanie, no. No, make it stop. No, Jeanie. My baby. No, let go of me. No, no. No. Get out. (somber music) - You need some time? - Yeah, maybe a few minutes. - We'll be waitin' in the car when you're ready. - Okay. (plane whooshes) (door creaks) - Cotton, I'm gonna ride the colt. You wanna watch me? - I'm busy. - But it's his first time. - Yeah, maybe later. - You sure? - Yes. - It's gonna be fun. Okay. Maybe you can talk to him, he's sick of me. - How's it goin'? Emily was lookin' forward to you bein' there when she rode a new colt. (plane whooshes) Just mad at me or is the whole world on your rift list? (dramatic music) - It just doesn't make any sense. Why give me a gift like that and then and not let me use it? (soft music) - [Clay] I don't know the answer to that, son, nobody does. - I don't know, it just all seems so pointless, cruel. (plane whooshes) - You know when Beth and Josh died, nothin' made any sense to me for a long time and I couldn't under stand why. Just stopped believin' in anything. Became pretty bitter, just kind of dropped out. Even Emily wouldn't talk to me, which was fine by me. But after a while I knew that it couldn't go on, for her sake as well as mine. Somehow I had to get past it. - How'd you do it? - I don't know, just time. (plane whooshes) Little by little, life gave me somethin' to hold onto, to believe in. A million different things. Seasons came and went. Emily started talkin' to me again. You showed up here, came into our lives and built a family when there wasn't one before. You know I don't put much faith in miraculous healings, holy visions or voices from the sky. My world is smaller than that. I tend to pay attention to the tiny, everyday miracles and the world's full of 'em. You just gotta get out of your own way sometimes to notice. (plane whooshes) And if it does turn out that you have a gift that could help people, well I'm sure you'll find a way to use it. I'm gonna go watch my little girl ride that colt. I expect it's gonna be a beautiful thing, I'd hate for you to miss it.
