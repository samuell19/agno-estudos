Ah! Let me go! No. No, no, no! Please, please, please, don't. Please... No! All right. Keep goin'. Shoulders back just a little bit. Turn to your left. This is for matching, work it a little more. Now try to do something different. Take a... Take five. - I gotta change cards. - Something wrong? No, everything's fine. Well, feel free to let me know if there's something I could be doing better. I've been having a hard time getting any calls from agencies, so... Yeah, I'm not surprised you're having a hard time. - Why is that? - 'Cause... You're, you're playing it too safe. I mean, it-it's-it's vanilla. Boring. I'll tell you what. Let me take a look at your portfolio. Yup, same. These make you look like you're trying to book gigs for retail ads in the Sunday paper. Do you really want this? More than anything in the world. Then you're gonna have to step up your game. Show a little more skin. I don't know. It's not really me. Never mind, I don't think you have what it takes to make it in this industry. You know, working models, they take risks. Wait. All right. That's more like it. All right, now step back into the light. Hm. You do have what it takes. Now you gotta start to feel it. All right. Head up just a little bit, shoulders back. Yeah, make it look like you love this. Take your top off. What? Don't be a prude, I've got connections with magazines that'll pay you some really good money for nude pics. You mean, like, porn? Dude, no way! Tasteful nudity has made, made girls like you very rich. Look, just give me back the photo card. You already have my money. We can get some really good pictures. It's up to you. Think about it. I can change your life. I can help you become very, very wealthy. It's your choice. I'm out of here. Sweetie... I can help you go places. Didn't you check the guy out before you gave him your money? Uh, yeah, I mean, his ad looked legit and he was the only one I could afford. Now I guess I know why. I mean, I still don't get it. Why do you want this so bad? You're an amazing artist. Okay, you should come to school with me in Miami. You've been talking to my mom again, haven't you? I just think you're really talented. And I don't think you should throw it all away. I'm not throwing anything away. Matt, I was the bucktooth military brat who moved from base to base. Completely invisible. I got through it by burying myself in fashion magazines, just dreaming of being one of those girls one day. Okay. I love you. Grace. Matt, what do you want me to say? I'd like you to say something that makes me feel like you care about me. I'm just not ready to say it right now, okay? You know this. I'm sorry. - Hey. Ready? - Hey. Oh, no. I have to work another hour. Lisa's sick. Well, you wanna wait for me? Um, no, I'll just take the bus. How did your photo shoot go? It was good. You know, it's not too late to tell the college you're enrolling. I mean, tomorrow's the cut-off. You could always model part-time. Tomorrow's also the cut-off for us to keep having this conversation over and over again. I told you already, that's not how it works. If I'm gonna do this, I have to be all in. Honey, there are a million girls, just like you, all trying to be stars. Thank you, mom. No, look, I know what it's like to have your head in the clouds and everything's great, but... I just can't stand here and watch you throw away an incredible opportunity. You just really don't believe in me, do you? Honey, that... No, that is not at all what I'm saying... Mom, this is what I want, okay? I-I just love you, I love you so much. I'll see you at home. "Dear Grace, thank you for your submission, but we are sorry to inform you that, unfortunately, you do not have the look we are searching for right now." "Connecting models and photographers with one click. No experience necessary, just exceptional beauty. For the right girl, we'll provide bus ticket, models' apartment, portfolio photos and introductions to top agents. Photographer's fee will be paid on the back end." It's too good to be true. Okay. And... sent. - Hello? - Hunter Kelly. Photographer, you answered my ad last night on Model Match. Oh! Of course, uh... Sorry, I'm just waking up. No problem. Well, I can call later. No. No, no, no. It's fine. I saw something special in your photos. I mean, you should head down to Miami. - Really? - Yeah. - Really. - That would be amazing. Um... Sorry if this comes off wrong. It's... Would you mind sending me some of your work? I've just been kind of burned in the past. Of course, I can. Thanks. - Where are you coming from? - Uh, Pensacola. All right, my assistant, Nicole, will send you the details. - Talk soon. - Okay. Oh, my God. He photographed her? No, no, Grace. Grace, I got your note. Listen... We really need to talk about this. - Grace? - Nicole? You got her. Welcome to Miami. How was the trip? Long. I think we stopped in every small town along the way. Oh. Annoying. Um, you can get cleaned up at the studio. Car's out this way. - Here, I'll take your bags. - Oh, thanks. Yeah. First time out on your own? Is it that obvious? I was the same way. I moved here from Shreveport a couple of years ago. - Oh. Why did you move? - Uh... My boyfriend asked me to come with him. It didn't really take a lot of convincing. Broken home, drugs. Same old sob story. So where is the studio exactly? Oh, it's about an hour from here. Very peaceful. And the models' apartment? Oh, that's back downtown. I'll take you there later. This really is the middle of nowhere. Just the way Hunter likes it. Oh! - Oh, did I scare you? - A little. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Welcome to my humble abode. - That's amazing. - Mm-hmm. The landscaping is so beautiful. If I lived here, I'd paint it all the time. You want me to show you around? - Sure. - Yeah. Nicole, you mind grabbing the stuff? This is where the magic happens. You know what? Stand right there. - Right now? - Yeah. Right now. Shouldn't I put on some makeup or something? No. No, no, no. You look... Natural, naive... Gorgeous. We'll never capture you this way again. Nicole? Can you help out with the lights, please? Thank you. What's that? Oh, I'm so sorry, I... I was gonna eat it in the car. I just... I have one rule. One... rule. Totally slipped my mind. Won't happen again. I'm sorry, I have a deathly nut allergy, and sometimes I go nuts. - Totally understand. - Cool. Let's just shake it off, okay? Okay, good. A little smile. You're so beautiful. - You're a natural. - You made it easy. Ah! Let's give you some more of that. Okay. We are out of Chianti. Nicole, would you mind running to the store for me? - Sure. - Oh. Um, I'm actually pretty tired. Is there any way you could drive me to the apartment now? Nicole will be right back and then she'll take you, right? Well, it's a pretty long drive, so I should probably go back. I'll be right back. Promise. Okay. Food is my vice. I don't do a lot of drinking. And my friends, I had a bunch of friends who passed away from drugs in this business, so... Oh, um, Nicole mentioned that you helped her out with that. Yeah, she's doing a lot better. It's all about empowerment. You know, a lot of people see modeling as vain and mindless... but when I look through the lens at my subjects, I see them come alive. Confidence grows. Like, you today. There's power in the photos I take. I never really thought about it that way. Well, here's to you. Small-town girl became a superstar. Yeah. Well, I hope I don't disappoint you. It's not possible. The model stuck her tongue out at the very last minute. And it made the cover. Oh, my God! Yeah, I know. Hey, what happened to Nicole? Oh, yeah, right. Let me check. Ah. Oh, I missed her text. She, uh... She's not feeling well, so she went home. Uh, what should I do? We have a guesthouse in the back. The models use it all the time. All right. It's so pretty here at night. - Yeah, right? - Hm. Hm? - It's nice. - Mm-hmm, told you so. Hm. Anna Karenina. Scarlet Letter. You have a thing for empowered women. Yeah, like I said, empowerment. You should have everything you need. Coffee maker's in there, towel, hairdryer. I know I'm being silly, but would you mind just checking for a car? - Of course. - Thanks. There are no cars nearby. Sorry. Well, I guess I can stay for just one night. All right. See you bright and early. Okay. Oh. Don't forget to lock the door. Hm... Oh! My bag. Hunter? Hello? Of course. Hunter! Hello? Hunter! 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hi, I'm trapped in a guesthouse outside of Miami, but I don't know the address. Can you help me? Get comfortable. You're gonna be here a while. What? Hunter? Hello? Hello? So you just haven't heard anything? No. No, maybe something will strike you. I mean, I hate to go through her stuff, but... I already went through that, there's nothing there. I mean, I guess I could go through her computer, but... Matt, this is all my fault. I pushed college too hard. You can't blame yourself, Ms. Somerville. Okay, I did the same thing. We spoke the other night about it. It's just hard not to be overprotective, you know, knowing that she's out there by herself. Rise and shine, beautiful. - What do you want from me? - Eat first. I'm not hungry. I wanna go home. This is your home now. I think it's a great home, by the way. Don't even look at it. The door's locked. If you let me leave, I p-promise I won't tell anyone. You'll never see me again. But I have such big plans for us! Look. Some of my past stars. You're gonna have your very own TV channel. Wanna know the name? Lonely College Girl. You're finally gonna be a model, Grace. Don't worry. Don't worry. We'll start off slow. No nudity to begin with. It'll be like a movie trailer. We hook 'em. We reel 'em in. You're insane. I will never do that. Every day you'll perform a new theme. What sets us apart from every other site is that you're almost like a girlfriend to the rest of our viewers around the world. There's a bittersweet beauty in convincing people of false intimacy. All of our girls stayed here before. Where are they now? They're doing great. Europe, Asia. I would rather die than ever do this. Grace... You love your mother, don't you? How do I know you didn't pre-record that? Walk past her mother. Drop a napkin. That's not magic. That's happening now. You have the power to keep your mother safe... if you just do what I say and accept this. Okay? I'm gonna need this, though. I'm gonna need all your security passwords and your social media. - Never. - Never? Uh, 12-01. Military brat number one. Good girl. Now, your family's not gonna be thrilled with your new occupation, but they'll get over it eventually. Oh, and one other thing. I disconnected your cellular signal. Not traceable. We're a team now. We're gonna have fun. Come on. Your, uh, alter-egos are all hanging in there. Great. Pick it out. We go live in 15. Now? Now. Memento mori. We're dying every minute. You're gonna be a celebrity. Trust me. Which outfit for your debut? I'm thinking the cheerleader outfit, yeah? Think it'll look cute on you. Oh... Please, no. Put it on. Put it on! There you go, the pom-poms. Let's see here. Grace, I just saw your photos. Um... I'm glad you're okay, but I really need you to call me, please? Um... I'm just really worried. I love you. Hello, Ms. Somerville. Any news about Grace? She just posted some photos. Okay, hold on. Let me check. I see 'em. Well, I guess... At least we know she's okay. I know, but it's so unlike her not to call. All right, well, I'm gonna message her now. Okay. Just let me know if you hear anything, please. I will. "I love you?" So now you say it? - Hey. - Hm. When we're done in here, do you wanna hang out? Just us? Ah, maybe. I got a lot of high hopes for this one. Okay, twirl for me. Good. We go live in five, four, three, two, one... Action! Okay, now, uh... use your pom-poms. Move your hips nice and slow. Okay, simple. Now take off your top. Surprise. Uh-huh. Okay, Grace, now turn around and show your fans what you've got. Turn around. That's more like it. Can you smile for me? Come on, cheerleaders have pep! Smile, Grace. Please help me! I'm being held captive. Call the police! Please, you have to help me! You disappointed me today. I had so many expectations for you. A few rules, you will not call for help or give any sign that you are distressed. Or there will be consequences. You should know that these videos are not traceable because I scramble the IP address every hour. Honestly... that's what the delay button is for. I'm not an unreasonable guy. I'm not. I know how tough it can be for the first time. But the more you do it, the more comfortable you'll get. I know it's the first time you've done this. I understand. But I'll be there to guide you. Okay? Grace, please. Please call me. I need to know you're okay. We have something to celebrate! Anyway... We... You are a hit. The most views for a debut yet. The Scared College Girl worked. This is so great. I can see your storyline now. Timid to temptress. Yeah. Have your bourbon. I don't want any. Oh, come on! A little bit. It's time to enjoy. Okay, fine. Suit yourself. It's a $100 a bottle. Yeah. Books are such a great escape, aren't they? You know what? We should do a librarian theme. We haven't done that yet. Bun, glasses. It'd be great! It's quiet enough in here. Who-o-a! Okay. Okay. Just take this away from you. I don't think my message is being... clear enough to you. Let me show you something. Take a look at this. Beats one of my better photos. - What did you do to her? - Only what I had to. It's very simple how things work around here, Grace. Do what I say and you'll have a good life. Don't do what I say and you won't. You're a celebrity now. We go live tomorrow. Get some rest. Oh... And a bomb blast won't scratch that. So the lamp probably won't, either. Why the long face? You told me when the last girl left that the next one wouldn't take up so much of your time. What about our plans to run away to Mexico, huh? Why are we still here? This is what I do. - Hm. - You know that. She's gonna run her course just like the rest of the girls, then I'll cut her loose. I care about you, you know that. I don't know. It's hard to tell sometimes. I rescued you when nobody else would. I kept your secret. All this I do, I do for you. We'll be together forever. I promise. Hm? - Easy. Easy, Hunter. - You know... You know you want it, Grace. Grace? Oh, my God. You called me Grace. I have a lot on my mind. I don't believe you. - Come here. - No. You can do this. Okay, remember, timid to temptress. We go live... in five, four, three, two, one... Action. Great. That's more like it, Grace. Yes. Everybody loves it. Yeah. And what about you? As long as she keeps doing what she's doing, I'm happy. I'm going for a run. Matt, I'm coming to Miami. Nicole? Thank God. We have to get out of here. Hunter has me trapped! Stop leading him on. You're not his girlfriend. What are you talking about? Get out of my way! What are you doing? Hunter and I don't have secrets. You're in on this? Ho-how could you be with him? He-he trapped me and he killed someone! He's the one. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I love him. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going? - She tried to kill me. - She attacked me. Nicole, what are you doing in here? Oh, you've got to set some boundaries with her. How many times have I told you? Comparison is the thief of joy. Now go inside and think about what you've done. And don't ever come out here again without my permission. Don't worry about her. She's weak. She does this with all the new girls. You're what matters now. What if she tries to hurt me again? She won't. I promise. Thank you for saving me. I really thought she was gonna kill me. What did Nicole say to you? That I'm leading you on. Are you? Did you like that? That wa... That was nice. You're smarter than the other girls. You remind me of my mother. You'd never leave me alone, would you? Never. Okay, you say she's been texting the both of you. Right? Posting photos all over social media from some, uh, modeling-gig thing she's at? But somehow you think something happened to her. Yes, Grace would never go this long without talking to me. Well, how long has it been? Two weeks. Oh, no. Please don't look at me like that. Call it a mother's intuition, whatever. I know something's wrong. No, I'm telling you, she's right. Look, Grace wouldn't do something like this. Mm-mm. You know... do you ever just think that maybe she doesn't want to be found? Look, the... The longest that I have gone w-with not speaking with my daughter... has been one week, and that was because she was at summer camp. So, please, detective, you have to help us find her. Look, all the evidence points to her being alive and well, and so... I... I wish there was more I could do, but... W-w-w-what about her computer? - Can't you just go through her... - I brought it... No, I brought it with me, it's in the car. No. No, I can't. I need a warrant for that. What about tracking her phone? I mean... At least I'll know for sure she's in Miami. I mean, I pay the bill. It's a joint account. S... So-so that's it? That... I thought the police were supposed to help people. I mean, what... What if she's being kidnapped? I mean, she... T-taken out the country? - Just... - No. Y-you don't know, you're... Now there's no evidence to point to that. - Why don't you help me? - No. No-no. There's no evidence that points to that, okay? Why don't you help? You don't know... Oh, my God... I-it's like he didn't even care. I know. But listen, we're not gonna give up on her, all right? I'm gonna stay on him every single day. This is a nightmare, Matt. I know. I know. What are you gonna do now? I'm gonna stay in Miami. Did you see all those girls on the wall? If he's not gonna find her, I am... even if I have to go to every photography studio in this place. Hey. I'm gonna help you, okay? We're gonna find her. Come here. What's all this? You never told me it was your birthday. I didn't realize... No calendars in here. - Yeah, there's none of those. - Yeah. Open it. It's not gonna bite you. - It's beautiful. - Put it on. Be right back. I love it. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Wow. Could you spin for me? You look amazing. You're the first girl that I've ever considered... I want us to be a team... in every way. That's nice. Can you teach me about what you do? Yeah... I'd like that. What if I posed as, like, a sexy art student? I could paint a naked portrait or I could even paint my body. I love that. I just need to get to an art store. Yeah, I-I'll get you the supplies. I'll get whatever you need. Well, I'm pretty picky about my supplies. Maybe I could go with you. We could go out, like a real couple. I, I-I don't think that's a very romantic date. Um, just give me a list... we'll get everything you need. Sure. - Hi. - There you are. We're not streaming for a few hours, right? - We're not? - You wanna do something? Can you go to the art-supply store and get me a few things? - I'll text you the list. - Okay. Uh, what's it for? It's for the performance tonight. Good news. Nicole will get your supplies. Oh. Great. Uh... Well, I need her to pay really close attention to the list. The paints on there are really specific. - And the linseed oil... - Well, don't worry, don't worry. It'll be fine. I was thinking about what you said. You do deserve a treat. How about I take you out on a date? Maybe take you shopping? - You mean it? - Yeah. No more old clothes. A whole new wardrobe. Thank you. Let's make a day out of this, yeah? You're the first girl I trust this much. Oh. Insurance policy. Don't worry. Welcome. Can I help you with anything? No, we're just gonna look around a bit. Oh. Here we go. This is nice. This... Purple... - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Have fun. - Hm. - You're doing okay in there? - She's fine. Let me know if you need another size, okay? Um, actually, could I get this in a smaller size, please? - Sure. - Thanks. Ah... You know what? I'll take that. Get your things. If you make a sound, it'll be the last one you make and hers. We'll come back later. Okay. Excuse me. Uh, stop, please. Stop! Hey! Stop! Get back here! - That's... - What do you wanna do, huh? Can't fuckin' believe you'd do that. - Get out of the car! - Ah. Ah! Come on, bitch! Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Put on your outfit. We're going live! - I'm sorry. - I told you not to lie to me! - I told you not to lie to me! - Please, I'm sorry! - Why would you do that to me? - Well, I'm sorry! I-I'm... - Why would you do that to me? - Sorry! Please, I won't... You said you'd never leave me alone! Take it. Just take all of it. You... I'm so sorry. Hunter, I'm, I'm sorry! I real... I'm so sorry! I won't do it again, I promise. I promise, I won't do it again, please! Now you'll pay. No, no! No, I'm sorry! Please, don't do this to me! We go live in five, four, three, two, one. Action. There's something you're gonna wanna see. I don't think so. What did you say happened to your girlfriend, again? She got a modeling gig. Why? I don't think she's modelling. - Ow! - Oh, my God! Don't look. Sorry. She would never do this. H-how much do you know about computers? - It's my major. - Well... Can you track this IP address? Enough. Cut. Stop. Nice work, Nicole. I know it hurts... but it's temporary. No, it's not. He's a monster, Nicole. He's a killer. He has pictures. He showed me... Nicole... Go to the main house. Apparently, your boyfriend saw your performance today. He claims he's coming after me. Wipe that grin off your face. Call him and tell him to back off. Grace? Hi, Matt. Grace, where are you? Listen, I'm coming to get you right now. Just tell me where you are. I'm fine. Look, it's over between us. This is what I want. No! No, I don't believe you! Grace, who's doing this to you? No one. The videos are tastefully done. They have launched my modelling career. I'm really happy here. This is what I want and you just have to accept it. - I have to go now. - Grace, don't go. Please. - Just... - Goodbye, Matt. - Grace... - I love you. He's becoming a real problem. What are you going to do? Take care of the problem. Leave him alone. Please leave him alone! Please! Hey, I just left, uh, another photography studio. Another dead end. Um, any news? Yeah, but it's not good. Tell me. Come on. She's on a pornography site. No, not Grace, no. No. It has to be somebody else. No, it's not. I got a call from her. And I think she's being held against her will. I mean, she told me she loved me. She's never told me she loves me. Uh, can you contact the owner of the site? I can't. I-I've tried. We did have a breakthrough, though. My roommate was able to get into her computer. W-w-what did he find? Well, apparently, she went on to some website called Model Matchup. She responded to a post by some photographer with the handle Beautyclick. But, I mean, there's no way to respond to him. The post's been taken down. Ah, damn! Um... Well, I have a meeting with the detective tonight. And his shifts goes up at, at 8:00. I'm gonna keep seeing what I can find. I'll meet you at the police department later tonight. Grace. All right, um... Let's see if we can find a similar add to the one that Grace responded to. I mean, maybe this guy is using a different handle with the same MO. - I don't know. - I'm on it. Het, Matt, where are you? I'm-I'm at the police station. Um, I'm gonna go in. Hunter... I'm so sorry for what happened. I promise it won't happen again. - I know it won't. - What did you do? Exactly what I said I would. Matt won't be available for calls. It was the right thing. He was coming in between us. Matt was my past, but you're my future. This is my home. And I'm sorry I betrayed you. Do you expect me to believe that after what you did? I'll do whatever it takes. Do your art project. We'll start from there. Full nudity... like we discussed. Temptress. What's the matter with you? I saw the pictures, Hunter. You snooping through my computer? Yeah. And I didn't sign up for this. - What, are you gonna leave? - You lied to me. You told me you took those girls home. What else was I supposed to tell you, Nicole? - I think I'm done. - Oh, you think you're done. - Yeah. Really? - I don't think you are. Because you're a killer, too. So you're not gonna tell anyone, because if you do, you're gonna end up just like them. But it, it was in her search history. Well, these online ads come up and go all the time. Okay, they probably just shut down... But she-she responded to a-a post about a job. Can't your computer people track it down? Again, there's no sign of any foul play here. Okay, you told me her boyfriend got a call from her just the other day. We think that whoever has her forced her to make that call. You don't know that for a fact, do you? All right, listen, look... I got some intel on your daughter's phone. Turns out, it last pinged on a tower near Miami train station. - That mean anything to you? - No. My gut tells me that she's come back into town on her own free will and she just doesn't want to be found. When was the last time that her phone was on? It pinged off a tower about two weeks ago. Oh, but she could be using a, a wireless network, so that certainly helps. Don't you find that odd? What 19-year-old cares enough about her cell plan that she keeps doing it for two weeks? - I'm sorry I'm late. - Matt, I'm so glad you're here. Matt, I was just about to tell Mrs. Somerville here that, um, I'm sorry I wish I could do more. But I really can't devote anymore manpower, searching for a girl who's just posting all over social media about how a wonderful life she's having and... We're gonna keep looking for her with or without your help. Come on, Matt, let's get out of here. I wish I could do more, but I just... Thought I'd tell you myself, we go live in ten minutes. This better be good. Let's do this. Five, four, three, two, one. Good. Your body is the canvas. Good. Now your breasts. Good. Okay. Don't let me down, 11th-grade chemistry. Okay. Yes! Okay. Okay. Do you hear that? Stay here. Grace? Grace? Aah! Come on. Car keys, car keys. 9-1-1. Can I help you? Hello? Hello? Help! Help me, please! Help! - Help! Help! - Go back to bed! Help me! I might lose my eye because of you. Oh, my God! Could you stop? Just... 10-23, Robertson approaching front door. Officer? - How can I help you? - Good evening. We had a 9-1-1 call from a woman. Just makin' sure everything's okay. We had a little fire in the guesthouse, some art materials. I put it out really quick, so, uh, she hung up. Where's your girlfriend now? She's asleep. What happened to your eye? Can you believe it? First time I've ever had a fire extinguisher and used it before and-and it blew back and hit me in the eye. It's got a kick, that thing. Mind if I take a look around? Yeah. Of course. Come on in. Be my guest. Evening, ma'am. Everything okay? Couldn't be better. Well, except that my boyfriend almost took his eye out. - You need medical attention? - No. The patch makes it look worse than it is. Sorry you had to come all this way. - No worries. That's my job. - Let me show you out. Hey, uh, you never did say, was there any damage to your guesthouse? No, just smoke. We're lucky. I thought you said there was a fire. If you don't mind, I'll take a quick look at the guesthouse before I leave? Sure. Right this way. Please! Help me, I.... Where's your key? Here it is. All units, we got a reported multiple-vehicle accident on Route 40 near the Woodbury Road exit. Officers in the vicinity, please respond. Copy that. On my way. Hey, it looks like everything's under control here. - I'm gonna respond to that. - Yeah, sure. - I'll walk you out. - Thank you. No! Come back! Oh, look, I found it. I found this ad. It's exactly like the one that Grace went to. It has the train ticket, the model apartment. Look. Can you trace it? Probably it's gonna run into the same problems as before. What if we respond to the ad? That I can do. It's him. What did, what did he say? What did he say? He's asking if our girl would come to Miami right away. A new girl's coming from Jacksonville. Go get her. Is there a problem? Are you having second thoughts? 'Cause I can fix those second thoughts. What time does her train get in? Hey, she's not here. What do you mean she's not there? I don't know. I mean, the, the train station's empty. Everyone left already. Dammit! Matt, did you find something? Yes, I'm on the way to Grace right now. Wait, wait! Where-where are you? I'm coming. No. It's too dangerous. Look, I'm gonna bring Grace back. I promise. No, Matt, wait! Wait! Wait! The girl never came. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do, Grace? What am I gonna do, Grace? What am I gonna do, Grace? Hunter, if you give me another... Give you another chance? I've already given you! I've given you so many chances, but it's-it's over. You've used it all up. You... You used it all up. It's over. I've already dug your grave. - What do you mean? - I've already dug your grave. I, I've already made a hole for you. I-I-I-I-I know... I know, I know what I'm gonna do. I mean, it's so, it's so obvious. I'm gonna film it. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm... I'm gonna film... I'm gonna film... I'm gonna film it. I'm gonna film me... killing you. - Yeah, on camera. - You can't. I'm gonna k... Yes, oh, I can. A-a-and no one's ever done it. No one's ever done this. Oh, my God, yes. Hunter, if you give me one more chance... No, there're no... Stop talking, stop talking. - I'll do whatever you want. - I just need you to be there! Just be there. I just need you to be there. Be there. Hunter? Ugh... I know how I'm gonna finish my piece. I'm gonna do away with her online. - What? - It's so simple. - It's so simple. - Hunter, this is crazy. It's not crazy. I don't know why I even try to explain it to you in the first place. - Matt, are you... - No, no touching! No touching. - Matt, are you okay? Matt... - I told you. No touching. You should do a private show for Matt. Go put on something pretty for Matt. - Matt! Matt! - No, don't touch. Don't need to touch. I have one rule. One rule. What's that? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm... I was gonna eat it in the car... "I'm so sorry, I was gonna eat in the car. I forgot." I have a deathly nut allergy. Sometimes I go nuts. Get ready for your kiss, Hunter. Morning, boyfriend. Clock's ticking, Grace. I have one rule. One rule. What did you do? - What's happening? - Don't worry about it. - We have to run, sweetheart. - Now. Help me. My Ep-Ep... Epipen! No... - I lost my keys. - O-okay. - I can get Hunter's. - No, no, we gotta keep running. There's nowhere to go, he'll find us! That's a wrap. Honey, you amaze me. Look how beautiful... I'm so proud of you. All that you went through... that's a lot of courage. Thanks, mom. I'm proud of you, too. I can't believe you're finally following your dreams of becoming a lawyer. And maybe we can carpool to classes together. - Ooh, can we, please? - Yeah, okay. What is so funny? Oh, nothing. I think I'll take a walk. Okay. Hm. You know, you really look beautiful. Well, it's not exactly what I pictured when I dreamt of being a model, but... No, it's even better. I love you. I love you, too.
