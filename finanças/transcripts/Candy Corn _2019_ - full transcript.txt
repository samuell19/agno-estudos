No, see, that's what I'm saying. We don't need to drive out to the middle of nowhere. The big ogre got a job at the freak show this year. So you just want to do this out in public? I don't know, man. Why don't we just do it at his house like we always do? Yeah, I'm with Steve on this one. I mean, I don't think it's worth spending a night in jail over. No, we're not going to do it in the fucking Midway, and we're not going to do it at his shit-hole of a house. We've done that too many times. This year, it's going to be bigger and better. I've already scoped it all out. We're going to wait for him back behind their trailers. When he gets there, we'll rough him up, strip him down, and then let him run down the midway in his shit-stained underwear like the freak show faggot that he is. Everyone'll get a few laughs, he'll run home to mommy, and we'll be back to Steve's house in time to celebrate another successful Halloween. You guys are unreal. Aren't you a little old to be fucking with that kid? I mean, you know he's not all there, right? Can't we just go back to your place and find something a little more productive to do? No. This is tradition. We've been doing this since we were kids and we're not stopping now. But why, Mike? Because, Carol... ...it's fun and it's easy. I'll be in the car. You better not pussy out on us, Steve. Don't worry, man. She'll be fine. We're not going to miss this. You cool? Yeah, sure. Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. I'll catch up with you guys later. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you! Why don't you call your sister and the three of us can do this thing together? I'm out of here in an hour, I can pick her up. Oh, you're killing me, man! Alright, then. Let me know. You know where to find me. Well, lookey here. You fellas off to find some trouble or what? Oh, just the usual Halloween hazing. Oh, now that's what I'm talking about. Details, details. I don't think so. We just need to get that stuff you owe us. Ah, come on, let me in on some of this action. I'm dying in this place. Okay. Okay, well, how about I don't have "the stuff", pal? Did you ever think about that? Fuck off, man, come on. Look, guys, I don't ask for anything. You know that. Just do me this one solid. Let me come with you tonight, would you? I need this. You double it, I'm not paying shit, and you're driving. Shit yeah, that's a deal, my man. We meet back here at 7:00. Right on, fellas. I got ya. Oh, hells yeah. Back in business, baby. This place is disgusting. I can't believe these freaks actually pay for this stuff. Yeah. This place definitely gives me the creeps. Steve, do we really need to do this? I have a bad feeling about it. Come on, Carol. There's nothing to worry about, okay? Let's go. Jacob, you're late! What did I tell you, boy? You're lucky the stakes aren't as high this weekend, but if I'm going to take you on the road with us, you've got to get your shit together! Jacob... ...come here, big guy. Now, you know I wouldn't put you in any situation I wouldn't put myself in, right? You are one of us now. Don't you forget that, okay? Now, go on. Let's give these freaks a show! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, your host of the evening, the world famous Dr. Death! Ladies and gentlemen, boils and ghouls! Welcome to the grisliest show on earth... ...Dr. Death's Sideshow Spook House Spectacular! I am your host, Dr. Death, and I just need to know one thing from you before we get started... ...are you ready to scream!? Hey, fella, you wouldn't happen to know where I could find a little action, would you? Hey, big guy, Happy Halloween. The freak at the freak show, how perfect. Oh, don't worry, man, we're not going to hurt you. We just want to make sure everybody gets all the freak they can handle tonight. But it looks like you got a head start on us. Hey, chill out, man. Well, it looks like the freak grew some balls this year. Listen here, you inbred, toothless fuck. We just came here to have a little fun, but if you're going to go and get all tough guy on us, that could change our plans real fast. Jacob. Jacob, wake up. Ahh... Get him inside! Quickly! Motherfucker had it coming to him. Yeah. It's not like we went there to hurt him. He threw the first punch. That's right, it was self-defense. Self-defense? Are you fucking kidding me? - Carol, calm down. - No, fuck you, Steve! Fuck all of you! Where are you going? I'm walking home. For thou who puts the hopeless soul too soon unto the underworld, cast your eyes once at this sign. Your teeth and bones, they shall be mine. For thou who sleeps in stone and clay... ...heed this call! Rise and obey! Pass again through the mortal door. Come to thou and walk once more. ¶ Give me that old time religion. ¶ ¶ It's good enough for me. ¶ ¶ Well, it was good for Paul and Silas. ¶ ¶ It was good for Paul and Silas. ¶ ¶ It's good enough for me. ¶ ¶ Give me that old time religion. ¶ ¶ Give me that old time religion. ¶ ¶ It's good enough for me. ¶ Dispatch to Sheriff Bramford. Yeah, Marcy, go ahead. Sam, Mrs. Hoffstat called twice since you left. Copy that, dispatch, I'm driving down lovely Ms. Hoffstat's road as we speak, and I do not see a single case of lewd conduct. Not a one. We certainly appreciate your bravery, big, strong Sheriff Bramford. You know what, Marcy, I like it when you get jealous like this, but let's face it, there's-- Sam? I just saw your sneaky ass. Now show yourself. Sam, do you copy? Yeah, I'm here, go ahead. Thank God. You know I hate it when you do that. I'm sorry, Marcy, everything's fine. Well, I wouldn't get ahead of yourself there, Sam. You need to get down here right away. We have a situation. Okay, on my way. Sheriff Bramford, Miss Sapirstein has something she would like to talk to you about. Hey, Carol. What's wrong? Is it Mike? Go ahead, honey. Tell him what you told me. No. I mean, not really. Look, I don't know what I'm doing here, I just didn't know who else to go, and my dad's out of town... It's fine. Just breathe, and tell me what's going on. A few of us went to the carnival last night. They didn't mean for things to get so crazy. They were just messing around. Did someone get hurt? Yes. That kid, Jacob Atkins. They play some stupid prank on him every year, and, last night, he hit Mike and they all attacked him. I should have told someone sooner. I just didn't know what to do. I was just scared. And then Bobby called me last night, and... That's fine. What did Bobby say? He said he thinks they might have killed him. Well, first off, nobody reported anything about this. And I can assure you, I'd be the first person to know if there was a murder in town. That's true. Now, what the boys did, on the other hand, that was completely out of line. I'll be having a talk with Mike right away. No, you can't tell them I was here. This is so stupid. I should go. Hey, I won't tell anybody you were here. Now, get on home and get some rest. Guess I'm going to the carnival. Well, have fun. Yeah, yeah. Good morning, Sir, I'm Sheriff Sam Bramford, Grove Hill Police Department. Do you have a minute? No, not really. Well, I'd like to talk to you about an incident that happened here last night. Oh, you mean, my employee getting his brains kicked in. Employee? Jacob works for you? Look, Sam, was it? As much as I appreciate you coming down here to deliver justice to your local hoodrats, you're a little late. Jacob took one hell of a beating, but he's just fine. I see. Okay, well, thanks for your time. God, that's what I love about you guys. You see, I take this show all over the country, and over the years, I learned two things about cops: they never prevent the bad things from happening, they just show up after the crime's done, like glorified garbage men with a badge. Is that a fact? And what's the second thing? I don't fucking trust any of them. Ya'all have a nice day. What did you do? Sam to dispatch. Dispatch, go ahead. Yeah, Marcy, I'm just leaving the fairgrounds now. I just talked to the guy that runs the carnival down here, and he confirmed Miss Sapirstein's story about the boys pounding on that Jacob kid. But he also informed me Jacob's alive and well, just beat up pretty bad. And, get this... ...apparently, he's got Jacob working for him. Really? That seems a little weird. My thoughts exactly. So I'm going to head on over, and I'm going to pay Jacob a visit, see if I can't get his side of the story. Something doesn't feel right about any of this. Copy that, Sam. Hello? It's Sheriff Bramford. Hey, Jacob, are you home? I just want to speak to you for a minute, buddy. Hello? Hello? Carol. Carol. Hello? I know what you did. You're a dumbass. You almost gave me a heart attack. What, I was just trying to scare you out of those little shorts. Fat chance of that ever happening if you pull something like that again. I was just having a little fun. What are you so wound up about? Wound up? Why am I so-- Do you remember what I watched you do last night? Look, Carol, I'm sorry, okay? But Jacob's fine. Mike's dad went down and checked it out himself. What do you mean? Did they call the cops? I don't know. Look, I'm sorry. Just come over here and kiss me. Well, don't do anything like that again. I won't. You're so goddamn cute when you're scared. I'll pick you up after work. Order for Carol. Hey, Carol. Mike, you scared me. You know I really didn't appreciate the way you treated me on the phone earlier. That was you? Very funny. You know, I actually wanted to tell you I had an interesting talk with my dad this morning. Okay. Come on, Carol. I know you ratted us out for what happened last night. But why? I thought you were cooler than that. I don't know what you're talking about, Mike. But I have to go. What are you doing? Look... I know you ran your mouth because you're a scared, little bitch, and you care about that big, retarded fuck for some reason. But the idiot is alive and well, which means no one had to say a damn thing. So why don't you do us all a favor and just keep your fucking mouth shut from now on? Okay? Can I help you, man? Hey, buddy. Hey, you're late, asshole. Again. Yeah, look, man. Your boy Gus here had a really wild night, okay? Type of stuff you couldn't even dream about. Oh, yeah? What the hell happened, brother? Tell me about it. Let me put it to you this way: there was a lot of asses last night. Some of them got kicked, and some of them got sticked. You picking up what I'm laying down? Gus, you're the coolest, brother, you know that? Hello, Grove Hill, this is your favorite radio host, Max "The Wax Man" Taylor. And I am coming to you live from the spooktacular Halloween carnival at the Grove Hill fairgrounds. Now, people, this place needs to be seen to be believed. They've got freaks, they've got treats, they've got fun, they've got games for everyone. So bring your sister, bring your mother, bring your dog, but you better hurry, because this freak show is packing up, and leaving town after tomorrow night. So don't you dare miss it. ¶ I had a dream last night, ¶ ¶ That filled me full of fright, ¶ ¶ I dreamt that I was with the Devil, below, ¶ ¶ In his great big fiery hall, ¶ ¶ Where the Devil was giving a ball. ¶ ¶ I checked my coat and hat ¶ ¶ and started gazing at ¶ Yeah? Gus. It's me, Shirley. Can you open up? Well, hello, Shirley. What could big Gus do for you? I heard about what you did last night, and I just... ...well, I've never met a man like you before. I want you to do everything you want to me. ¶ I caught a glimpse of my mother-in-law ¶ ¶ Dancing with the Devil, Oh! The little Devil, ¶ ¶ Dancing at the Devil's Ball. ¶ Please. Motherfucker! I swear to God. I can't get five fucking minutes in this place. ¶ It wasn't long before I ordered a fan ¶ ¶ And before the break of dawn ¶ ¶ I put my overcoat in pawn ¶ ¶ At the Devil's Ball. ¶ Fuck! Fuck is your problem, man? All right, calm down, calm down. I was just... Wait a second. Yeah, I know you. Shit, man, you're the guy from last night. Look, I didn't even know those guys. They needed a ride-- ¶ At the Devil's Ball. ¶ ¶ ...saw the cute Missus Devil, so pretty and fat, ¶ ¶ Dress'd in a beautiful fireman's hat ¶ Yeah, come in. I said come in. Jesus Christ. What? Hey. Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I said I'd pick you up after work. Just wanted to surprise you. It's a great surprise. What's up? What's going on? Mike cornered me at Cooper's today. He told me he thinks I went to the cops. Right before he threatened me. Hey, Mike's all riled up because his dad laid into him. Don't worry about it. I'm going to talk to him, and it won't happen again. Well, he's a prick and I hate him. But what do you think about me? Hey, did you guys hear what happened? Chet? I know this is unbelievably difficult for you. It's quite literally a shock to all of us. But we're going to get to the bottom of it, son. Hey, I need you to go down to the station, and give a report to Marcy. Anything at all could help us catch whoever did this. Can you do that for me? It's going to be okay, son. Is he going to be all right? I don't see how he could be. Conrad, I need you to take Chet down to the station and file a report. Probably not going to say much, but I want you to get anything you can out of him. Yes, sir. But I want you to get anything you can out of him. Yes, sir. Sheriff Bramford, what's going on? What are you doing here? We heard Gus was killed. If you two know something, you need to tell me right now. So Gus drives you out there, turns up dead the next day. I can see why you guys would be freaked out, but I'm telling you, there's no connection. Look, Gus was a bit of a bad apple. We don't know the kinds of things he was into. So, what, you just want us to go about our lives like nothing happened? Like it's just some weird coincidence? I want you to stop worrying, because there's nothing to worry about. Come on, Carol. I'll walk you guys out. See, this is why you need to carry a gun. I don't know why you don't. Because things like this don't happen in our town. It's a fluke. All right, Fox, you and I will go to the carnival and check things out. Conrad, you're on patrol. You'll know where we'll be if we find out anything interesting. Okay? Okay, let's roll. So what kinds of things do you think that Gus character was into that would warrant that kind of execution? Who knows, Fox? Could be any, old thing. If I had to guess, I'd say drugs. I just can't believe it. I haven't seen anything like this in my entire life. I mean, the time it would take to do something like that-- - Fox, Fox, Fox! - Who would even-- I don't know. Holy shit. And Mike's dad is certain it had nothing to do with what happened last night? Seemed pretty confident about it. So what's the big emergency? Gus was murdered, asshole. Yeah, I know, Carol. My dad's the sheriff, remember? So what's that got to do with me? Look, man, we're just kind of freaked out. Don't you think it's sort of weird? No, Bobby, I don't think it's weird. People are saying he had candy corn shoved down his throat. Isn't that a little coincidental? Jesus Christ. I think we should consider the fact that... maybe this isn't a coincidence at all. Maybe it's something more. Oh, really? Like what? Like Jacob killed Gus and he's coming for all of us? The guy can't even spell his own name, and you think he's the fucking Zodiac killer? Look, man, maybe she's right, maybe you're right. We don't know. But it's not going to hurt anything if we're just a little bit more careful And what do you think, Bobby? I don't know, man, maybe-- That's right, you don't know. None of you do. So my suggestion is you all take a fucking chill pill, and forget about it. Fuck Gus, and fuck Jacob. Maybe he's right. Maybe it's nothing. Yeah, maybe. Come on, let's go. Hey, it'll be all right. Steve? Mike? I swear to God, man, if you're-- Well, look who it is! My old, pal, Sam. What a treat! And look! He brought a friend. What can I do for you fellas? - We need to-- - No, wait-- Shrunken head. No, no, no, no, that's not it, is it? Wait, how about a candlestick made from a hangman's fat? Where'd I put that, anyway? - We need to speak with-- - No, wa-- Shh. Why didn't I think of this earlier? There's no doubt in my mind you two gentlemen came for one of these. You know, they're normally six dollars a piece. But I want you each to have one as a personal thank you. A gift from me for being so welcomed to your vibrant little town. Here, take it. We need to speak with you somewhere private. Anything for you, Sam. So you think I had something to do with this? Is that what you're getting at? I'm not saying that. Not yet. We're just trying to get all the information we can. I'm sure you can understand that. No. I can't, actually. Where is Jacob right now? I'd like to talk to him. I told you, I sent him home to get some rest. After the gang bang your boys pulled on him... It's funny you should say that. I drove out to his place after I left here this morning. Wasn't there. Well, I wouldn't get your panties all in a bunch, Sam. I'm sure you've been turned down by better looking guys than Jacob. I've about had it with your lip! Is the sheriff in there? What is it, Conrad? Sheriff, there's been another murder. Don't look at me. I've got a rock-solid alibi this time. This is the-- This is the same exact... Fox, go call the coroner. How'd you find out about this? The neighbors were out walking their dog and heard screams. They know what happened? Good, let's keep it that way. Meet me back at the station. We've got some work to do. Oh, Sam, there you are. Is everything okay? No, Marcy, it's not. There's been another murder. Bobby, one of Mike's friends. Think I was wrong about who killed Gus. I need you to contact the local news and tell them to put out an announcement. No one's to be out after dark. Okay, um... Anyone caught on the street after the sun goes down will be arrested on the spot and put in jail. Conrad. I want you posted up on 71. No one under any circumstances enters or leaves this town. Fox, you stay here and you help Marcy. I'll be back. Yes, sir. Everything's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Oh, hello, I was just doing an experiment. I left the receiver on. That's what I thought, but I kept... Mike, we need to talk. ...the maid had been bitten by a bat, and she's afraid it might be rabid. What? Oh, all right. Tell her I'll be right over there. Look, son, I need you to be crystal clear with me. What the hell happened last night? Jesus Christ, we've been over this. You listen here. I've about had it with you! You're getting too goddamn old to be pulling this kind of shit. And this time I think you went too far. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means I'm starting to think that those characters down at the carnival are behind all this. Behind all of what? Behind what happened to Gus. This is insane. Look, I can't explain everything to you right now. I just need you to trust me on this. I need you to stay put, lock the doors, don't even think about going out until I get back. We're putting the town on curfew until i can figure out what the hell is going on. If you talk to your friends, you tell them the same thing I'm telling you. Call Marcy if you need anything at all. She'll patch you straight through to me. Andy, we're in trouble. Wendel Hines came in to pick up $350,000... Don't answer that. I'll be right back. Hello? Hey, man, what's up, I'm a little busy. So what's that mean? All right, it's still early, maybe the curfew will be lifted, and then we can have the party. All right, man, well, call me if anything changes. Sorry, that was Mike. Party's off. Yes, I understand Mrs. Waldorf, but that's all the information I have right now. - Everything good? - Yes, sir. Just stay put and wait for the Sheriff's word. Marcy, I know you're swimming in it right now, but just keep with it. We'll be back soon. Where are we going? We're going to Jacob's house. Grove Hill Police Department. Yes, those are the orders. Yes, yes, thank you. Grove Hill Police Department. You forget that I had you in charge when you were a very sick man. When you raved in delirium. And I heard you talk about a hidden room. Now, where else could you put a hidden room, except in that mansion you built? Jacob. It's the Sheriff, open up now. Stand back. Check upstairs. My God. Sheriff, I think I found something! What is it? It's under the bed. I'll be right back. What's all the chatter about? I said, what's all the chatter about? People want to know what's going on. When is this going to end? I'm sorry, but you'll have to help me better understand your question, Bishop Gate. When is what going to end? Tell them. Excuse me? I said, tell them! Tell them the truth about you, about Jacob. You're not going to come out on the right side of this. Not this time. You want to be a hero, then tell them the truth. At least let us die with a spec of dignity. Bishop Gate... ...I will never die. Sit the fuck down. Steve? Very funny, Steve. I guess you don't want to see what happens next. Despite what gossip has made its way through your trailers over the last 24 hours, I want you all to remember one thing: that there is a world outside of this place, and she is a mean, nasty, evil bitch. That wretched whore came in here last night, and she took one of our own. What I've down the last few hours isn't wrong. And it's not to be thought of as shameful. In fact, I'm proud. You should all be proud. Now, we know how this is going to end. The same way it's ended too many times before. So as this event comes to a close... ...I don't want you to feel anything other than pride. This town has created a witch hunt, and they are coming for the freaks. So, let's give them what they came for. Steve? Just trying to set the mood? Steve! Steve! Steve! Please, oh, please-- Help! Jacob, Jacob! No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not done yet. Goddamn it! We're almost there. So, do you think Jacob killed his mother? I don't know, Fox. I really don't think so. I mean, she'd been dead a long time. - Her body was all rot-- - I said I don't know, Fox! Look, Fox, I'm as terrified and confused about all of this as you are. I don't know what the hell's going on, but we're going to figure it out, I can promise you that. Goddamn it, what the hell is this? This is Steve Benson's car. He's probably in the theater fooling around with his girlfriend. Steve, are you in here, son? I'll check in here. Steve! Carol! You in here? It doesn't seem to be doing anything to the plant. And the second step is my Z-ray. Steve! Carol! Oh, Jesus Christ, no. Mr. Davenport! ...the door unbolted, the chain off, and you asleep on the job. Hello? Mike, it's me, is everything okay? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, why? Listen to me, son. There's something I need to tell you, and I didn't know how. Come on, Fox, let's go. I'm taking you back to the station. Hey, Dr. Freakfuck! Where are you, you little cocksucker? Shit! What... what the hell is going on? We need fresh blood. Well, we got company. Jacob's not ready yet. Have the others keep our guest entertained. We're going on a little trip. Lester... I know you're here you little piece of shit! Show yourself! Mike! Come on, son, let's go. How'd you get in here? Where's Mike? Calm down, Sam. No need to get excited and hurt yourself. You tell me where he is right now, or I swear to God I'll end you right where you sit. Come on, Sam. Mike! Where the hell is he? All right, if that's how you want it. Goodbye, Sheriff Bramford. Everybody's got to be a fucking hero. This is too much, Lester. Ladies and gentlemen, boils and ghouls! Welcome to the grisliest show on earth. - I am your host... - I'm your host. Dr. Death. And I just need to know one thing from you... Are you ready to... ...scream!? Oh, how the mighty have fallen. You dumb motherfucker. So, what, you're like a summoner of spirits? Something like that. And these are real human teeth? As real as real gets. So that's it? You just pried out some asshole's teeth, and made a necklace of them? That's your thing? Oh, no, no, no, no, it's much more than that. You see, everything in my shop here has a story, similar to the one that necklace has. I've been doing this a long time, and this cruel world doesn't get any nicer as time goes on. So as long as those freaks are out there, holding people like us down, I'll be right here... ...keeping the balance.
