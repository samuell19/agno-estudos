Deep in the Appalachian Mountains, people here, they play by their own rules. There are secrets that never leave these hills. Summer of 1929 was the year I turned 13, a summer of loss, fear, and the beginning of a new chapter. I lost my father in a railroad accident, and I became the man of the house while still a child. Ready, set! My best friend, Willy Stamper, lived up on Adam's Ridge. His daddy hated mine, never knew why. They had a feud between them since me and Willy was born. Do you, William John Stamper accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior? - Oh yes, Lord. Please, forgive me. - And do your repent for all your sins? - Yes, Lord, please forgive me. But Mama, she always let Willy come over. We were as tight as shoe leather until one day that would change everything. Willy! Willy! - Shh! Teddy, if I don't make it back home alive, you gotta tell my girl I love her. Incoming! No! - Damn it, Willy. You always die first. I never get to die first. - Come on, come back. Can't you tell my legs are full of shrapnel! I could shoot you from here and lame ya. I'm going swimming. - Wait up! - The water is so cold. - Yeah, I tell ya. - We better pick up the pace, we can't be too late. - Why is he always so mad? - Who? - Your daddy. - Buck? I don't know. Think it might be all that drinkin'. First the war, then Mama left him. You lucky you don't have a daddy. - Take it back. - What? - I said take it back right now. - Jeez Louise, Teddy, don't got your panties in a bunch. I just meant your lucky you don't have a daddy that hits ya. I guess any daddy's better than no daddy. - My daddy was a good man, salt of the earth. You think we got enough crawdads? - Probably not. I can handle the Buck, just make sure he's got plenty of drink. He'll be asleep all night. Teddy, look! What? - A quarter. - Let me see that. Wow, a real quarter. - This is going in my getaway jar. - Your what? - I got a jar under my porch. It's full of every change I find. One of these days I'm gonna run off from here. I ain't never coming back. - You can't leave me, Willy. You're my best friend, what'll do I do without you? - Jeez, Teddy. Hey. I got an idea. Give me your hand, come on now. - What are we like, eight? - Well, I already cut myself so you ain't backin' out now. Now, we're full-on blood brothers. Can't nobody ever take us apart. - That stings. Mama's not gonna like this. She's gonna think I was being careless. - She'll be all right. - She lost her husband and her baby. Maybe we can cut her some slack. - Come on, let's go. - That's it? - Yup. That's my getaway jar. - Why is it full of dirt? - It's not all dirt. Feel how heavy. 'Cause if Buck finds it, he'll think it's a jar of dried money nightcrawlers. But really it's my jar of get away money. Pretty smart, huh? - Yeah. So you water it down every time you add money to it? - Yes, sir. Sometimes when he sleeps, I can get some change from his pockets. He never knows. Dimes are my favorite 'cause they're small and they add up quick. He never notices a few dimes here and there. - How much you think you got in there? - Hard to say, but I'm getting close. That you boy? Get on in here. - Ah shit. - You wanna have supper at my house? - So, then Teddy gave me three dips. That should get me in, right? - I don't know what I'm gonna do with you boys. You know this can get infected. - That's what I told him, and he didn't listen. It's fine. - All right, well you're clean for now. I'm sure it won't stay that way. - Hey Willy, you want to go catch some lightning bugs? Oh yeah. All right. Come on. - Where you been, boy? - Me and Teddy was catching lightning bugs. - Well, I can see that. I'm not an idiot. Wipe your face. So you with that boy, that bastard boy? - His daddy died. - So you went to that Smallwood place again? - No, sir. - Don't you lie to me, you hear me? - Yes, sir. - Go clean up, get to bed. - Dad! Gotcha! - Dang it, Willy. You know what Buck might've done if he saw me peaking in his window like that? Oh, he ain't gonna hurt nobody. He's out like a light. - What happened to you? - I guess we didn't get enough crawdads. - He hit you? - Oh, I got him good. I peed in his drink. He's so drunk he don't even notice. - That's not funny, Willy. Look at your eye. - Here you go. Breakfast? - No thanks, they'll give me the runs. You too if you're not careful. - Not me. Guts of steel! - So, what do you want to do today? - I got an idea, let's have some fun. Hold my apple. - Willy! Buck's gonna kill us if he finds us playing with his gun. - Come on, don't be a scaredy cat. You getting soft on me? - No. - Come on! - Willy! Wait up. - Oh, Teddy, I thought you was gonna piss yourself. - What? I can't hear a thing. You done gone deaf soon. - I just wasn't ready, that's all. - Here, let me show you how to do it. See that coffee mug? I'm gonna get that one. Ha, you missed! - I'll get it this time, you watch. Yeah! Told you so, got it square between the eyes! - Okay. Come on, let me try. I think we're outta bullets. - Hey, how adventurous you feeling? - Should I be worried? - Come on! Listen, you hear that? - Yeah, sounds like a tractor. - Come on, let's go! - Wait. - Come on! - No, wait, Willy. - Teddy, he left it idling. - Okay, so? - Come on, let's go. - We can't just go take it. - Teddy, it's like he's begging for us to just go ride it. Let's go, come on! - No, we can't just ride it. Wait, Willy. - I'm going with or without you. - Willy! - Climb up here. - Me? - Yes, you. Come on. All right. First, release the break. Then you pull a little on the throttle. - This thing? - That's it. Now, it ain't easy, but you gotta get it out of neutral. Put it into gear. Throttle, throttle! - I'm trying. Woo hoo! - Come on! - I'm trying! I'm getting it! I'm like a tank! - You shoot the missiles and I'll take the ground cover. - Yeah, woo! - Come on, pick it up! - I can't go any faster! - I can literally run circles around you. - I'm going through the compound! Woo! Woo! Yeah! Willy, Willy! Willy! Willy, stop, stop, no! Willy! Willy, stop! Help, help, Willy! Willy, stop, stop! No! ♪ Just as I am, without one plea ♪ ♪ But that Thy blood was shed for me ♪ ♪ And that Thou bid'st me come to thee ♪ ♪ Oh lamb of God, I come ♪ ♪ I come ♪ - Folks. These services are probably the hardest for me to get through. It ain't right that any parent should ever say goodbye to their child. But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me "and do not hinder them." For to such they belong to the kingdom of heaven. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. For this child, I prayed and was granted my petition. Therefore, I have lent him to the Lord. - Enough. Open it. - Mr. Stamper, I don't think that's a very good idea. That little fellow's in some rough shape. - I don't remember asking you, now do I, Pastor? So if you'd so kindly do as I ask and open up the goddamn casket before I kick it open. - Don't look. - Look at him. Look at him! You did this. You did this. - Teddy! - You killed my boy! You killed my boy! - Now, let's have a look. - What you working on? - Just a silly little drawing. - Hey, don't sell yourself short, young man. You are quite the artist. Your daddy loved your drawings. - Mom, it's Buck. He's got a gun. - Teddy, take the girls to their room. Girls, go with Teddy. Can I help you, Mr. Stamper? - Send that boy out here. - Mr. Stamper, I think you had a little bit too much to drink. - Don't you tell me anything, woman. I said send that boy out here right now. - I will do no such thing. Now you best be leaving my home. - The way I see it, you got two choices. You either send that boy out here and I kill him, or you give that boy to me. It's the only right way. It's the only right way, an eye for an eye. Your boy killed mine, now I kill yours. You ain't taking my boy. - I'll kill him, it's your choice. - Like hell you will. What happened to Willy was tragic, but it was an accident. I know you are in pain, but my Teddy loved him. I loved him. You aren't the only one mourning here. So, I advise you to go home and sleep it off. - You don't preach to me. Now that boy's coming with me, dead or alive. And if I have to take all you out, so be it. I got enough bullets. - It's okay, Mom, I'll go. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. - Teddy, you get back inside, he can't take you. You get back inside. - Mom, Mom, Mom! - Teddy, no. Teddy, let him go! Let him go! - Please stop! - No, Mom! - Teddy! Girls, get back in the house! Get back in the house, lock the door! Lock the door! No, Teddy, Teddy. - Mom! - Huh? - No, no, don't hurt her, please! - He's my boy now. You say goodbye, son. He'll never come back. - Teddy, no, don't! You son of a bitch! No, Teddy! No! No! - Get out. Get out. Get up. I said get up! Welcome to your new home, boy. Way I see it. If my boy has to sleep in the ground, you sure as hell could sleep on it. Get up. I said get up, come on, boy. You're not gonna be lazy around here. There's work to do. Now get out to that coop, bring in the eggs. You ain't so ignorant you can't figure that out, right? - Yes, sir. - I said git, come on now. What is wrong with you, boy? You messed up in the head or do I have to get my belt on you? - I have to pee. - Well, you know where the woods are. Now, get to them chickens and bring in the eggs. I like mine over easy. And don't break my yolk. - Hello? - Sheriff. - I'm the deputy. - He took my son. - Hold on now. You say somebody took your boy? - Yes, Mr. Buck Stamper, up on Adams Ridge. - Stamper. - He took my Teddy. - He's the one who lost his boy, right? - Yes, please. You have to help me. - Now, Ma'am, I reckon this is a better job for the sheriff himself. - Fine, where is he? - Well, now he's in Charlottesville, and he'll be back tomorrow. - You have to do something. He is going to kill my boy. My hands are tied. I promise you, the sheriff will take care of it. Now why don't you run along back home, and I'm going to call him in the morning. - You're not gonna do nothing? - Ma'am, I suggest you calm down. Now that man is suffering, and he's just lashing out at your boy, okay? We'll handle everything. - You better pray hard my son is all right. - Oh, I'll pray. You should pray too. After all, he did kill his boy. - Coward! - Sit. I said sit. You ain't walking around this farm with that long hair. It ain't clean, and you ain't bringing lice into my home. You best be still. You better eat somethin'. You're gonna need your energy for tomorrow. You can make a bed out of one of them bales. Get another blanket from the horse. - I'm coming home, Mama. - I see you, boy. You think you could get away from me? I own you, boy, come on! - Ow, ah, stop! Please, please stop! Ah, ah! No, ow, why are you doing this to me? Why? 'Cause you killed my boy. You killed my boy! - No, no, ow! Please, stop! - The only thing I had. Huh, you hear me? You don't ever try to run away from me again. If you do, I'll take one of them sisters of yours. If they run away, I'll take your Mama. Get up. Huh, get up. I had a fine boy. He was good, and now I got you. Pathetic. You ain't half the boy Willy was. Morning, Sheriff. Little early for a house call, ain't it? - Morning, Mr. Stamper. Sorry to hear about your son. I got Ms. Rogers here. She tells me you came and took her boy against his will. Is that true? - Why don't you ask him yourself? - What happened to you, baby? - Now, boy, you want to tell me what's going on here? You got your Mama mighty shooken up about this. You afraid to talk, boy? What happened to your face? - Teddy, come on, let's go, baby. He can't hurt you no more. - Now, Buck. I don't know what you have in mind here, but that boy ain't yours. He belongs... - No! - Home with his Mama. - I fell off the truck. What'd you say, boy? - I said I want to stay here. This is where Willy was. I don't want to go back with you. - Now, it seems like we've arrived at an impasse. You heard the boy. He wants to stay here. - Boy, why don't you want to go home? - This is my home. I don't want to be with a bunch of girls. I need a man in my life. If you brought me back, I'd just run away. - Now, we'll just give him a few days. - No, that is my son, and I am not leaving here without him. - Now, now, you heard the boy! - Teddy! - We force him to go, he'll just come on right back. - Teddy, come home! Teddy, I love you, Teddy! Teddy, come home! - I guarantee... - No, you have to stay, you have to get him! - Give it just a few days. - No, please! - He'll be running down your driveway in just a few days now. - Please, please. - You just get on down now. - Please. - You know kids, now come on. - Teddy, Teddy, I love you, baby! I love you, come home, Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! - Sounds like a goddamn parade in here. Can you be any louder? - It's Thursday, we need milk. Gonna need to head into town if we expect to be... - Don't tell me what needs to be done around here, boy. - You want your egg fried? - Don't I always want my egg fried? - Yes, sir. What the hell you doin' in here, boy? - Nothin', just thinkin'. - You stealing from me? - No, sir. Willy must have found that years ago. - Don't you ever mention my boy! Huh, you understand that? He would have been one hell of a man had you not killed him. I'll teach you to steal from me. Willy! Willy, help me! - Don't you call on Willy. You never cared about him. We did all the work. When Willy died, I took his place, but this ends tonight you will never hurt me again, and you will never threaten my family again. Mama! Girls, anybody home? Hello? Mama? Mama? Girls, come on, anybody? Hello? Mama? Girls. Thank you, Willy. - What are your plans for the day? - Well, we were supposed to have a picnic, but the rain. Isn't that always the way? - Always. - Okay, that'll be five cents please. - There you go. - Thank you so much. Here you are. - Have a good day. - You too. Can I help you? - Me? - I'm not looking at anybody else, now am I? - No, Ma'am. - How much for an apple and two jerky sticks? - That'll set you back about four cents. - And a hard boiled egg. - Another two cents. - All right. - That'll be 6 cents there, big spender. You all right? - Oh my goodness. I don't need all this! Unless you'll be needing half the store! - No, Ma'am. I think that'll be all. - You forgot your change. - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Pardon me, pardon me. Here you go. Hey, Willy! - Can I help you? - Um, I'm sorry, sir. You know where public records are? - That way. - Thank you. Oh, oh my gosh, I am so sorry. - Oh no, they were all separated by jurisdiction. - I'll gladly help. - It's all right, I can do it. Sarah. - I can resort them. - It's my fault, sir. Are you from around here? - No, sir. Just looking for somebody. - Who you looking for? - Clara Rogers. Maybe you got records or a forwarding statement? - Clara Rogers. You mean Old Widow Rogers up on the Ridge? - Yes, sir. I believe that's her. - There's no forwarding address for her. You might want to check the cemetery. - Beg your pardon? - After her husband died, her boy, he killed another boy. And then he ran off. And then she got scarlet fever real bad, and the state came and took her girls. Why are you asking? - I'm mostly interested in her place. - Well, in that case I'd try the bank. They'd have the records and lien information. Good luck, son. It's a good farm. Somebody oughta be living in it. - Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, easy now. - I need to get help. - What's wrong, is that blood? Are you okay? - We snuck into the mill when everyone left for lunch and Paul, he's trapped inside the gears. He's bleeding pretty bad. We're in so much trouble. - Just tell me, where is he? - Downstairs of the Wells grain mill. In the grinding room. - Okay. - I need a big stick, like a garden rake or something. - Oh, um. - Gosh Here, try this. - You gotta come over here. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - Okay, come on, grab him, grab him. Okay, ready, pull. - Okay. - Pull, now! Oh my God, oh my God. - Hey, he needs a doctor, quickly. Uh, I can take him, follow me, come on! - Careful, careful. - Guys, come on. Doc, Doc, there's been an accident. It's Mr. Wells's nephew, sir, it's Paul. - Dear God, put him on the table. - Greta has the day off today. I'm gonna need one of you boys to stay and help. That's not gonna work. Can you tell me how long he's been unconscious? Son, you with me here? - What the hell happened to you? - Passed out from the blood, sir. It's mighty bad. - Why don't you head back to the mill. We got a pretty big mess to clean up. - What in the Sam Hills all the ringing in here. Oh, Clarence. Suppose you're here to check on your nephew. - How is he, Doc, I heard it was pretty bad. - You heard right, but he's gonna make it. The leg, I'm not so sure, but we did our best. If it wasn't for your employee back there helping with the boy, your nephew might be talking to St. Peter. - You mean Howard, who just left? - No, the young man in back. He stayed and helped me stabilize him. Couldn't have done it by myself. Sheriff is bringing an ambulance to get him over to Charlottesville. - If you won't be needing me any more, sir, I think I'm gonna head out. - What's your name, son? - Ted. Uh, Theodore, sir. Theodore Rogers. - Hell of a job, Mr. Rogers. That boy owes you his life. - Glad I could help. - Hey, hey, son! Hey, stop there! - Sir? - I'm Mr. Wells, I'm the owner of that mill. So you're the fella that carried Paul from the mill here? Yes, sir. - I need to shake your hand. You saved that boy's life. - I just carried him. - Don't be humble, you did an amazing thing. You looking for a job? - Oh yes, yes, sir. - Be at the mill at dawn tomorrow. I'll have a job waiting for you. How's $8 a week sound? - That's fine, I'll be there. - Starting tomorrow, you can use one of our delivery trucks to go to and from and to get your own. All right, get on out of here and change them clothes. You're a fearful sight! Gentlemen, you remember Theodore Rogers. He's gonna be delivering with us. Let me show you how we do this. Now on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you come over here and you see how many bags go to Charlottesville, how many bags go to Jacksonville. Now, each driver's responsible for their own vehicle. You fill it, deliver it and get it back here by supper time. The rest of the days, you just spend here filling the bags and grinding the corn into mash, sound good? - I can do this. Thank you for the opportunity. - Oh, and Theodore, next time you play hero, try to spare me some equipment. - You all right there, big spender? - Yeah, yeah. I'm just used to cranking it a little differently. - Oh yeah, sure. Those cranks can be real tricky. You have no idea what you're doing, do you? - It's been a while. All right so. Just start your engine. You're gonna want to press on that lever to your right and turn your key. That's your coil buck switch. Good job. - Okay. - Now, you need to make sure your car is in neutral, which is this lever in the center. - Okay, right here? - Mm-hmm. Now, you have two pedals on your left, which are your clutch and your brake. And then this pedal on the right is your accelerator, which is going to advance the car. So, first we clutch and then you gas. Good job. Now actually, if you turn right up here, I know a really good place for you to practice before you head out for delivery. Good job. Good job! Now, you need to make sure that it's in neutral before you try and start it again. You'll get it. Not too bad for your first driving lesson. - Second, it's my second time. - Well, you're a very good cranker. So, are you going to drive me back to town or do I need to walk home? - Sorry, I'll take you home. I'm glad you remembered the lever. - Can I help you? - Yes, I have a delivery. Cornmeal from Wells Feed and Grain. - Ah, you must be our new driver. - It's you! You're a real hero. Good news spreads like wildfire around these parts. - 10 bags, that sound right? - Yes, Ma'am. - You can put 'em in the back with the rest. Melanie will show you where. - Right this way. Go on girls. - Candy! - Candy! - Girls, no running, be respectful. - One piece each, girls, just one. You both excited? - Yes. - Yes, all right. There you go. You're picking out the two very best ones. Mine is bigger than yours. - Let me show you what we got in the other day. Come over here. Look at these little twin dolls. Don't they look just like you? Look at their twin dresses. - This one looks like me. - This one looks like me. - What about this one over here? Nice to see you, stay out of the heat. - That family that was just in here. - Reverend McCall, them little girls? - Yeah. Have they always lived here? - Sure. Except them little girls. Their Mama got real sick and she couldn't take care of them. And the Reverend and his wife weren't blessed with any children so they stepped in. What part of the country are you from? - Ma'am. - You from Maysville or you here in Charlotte, Jackson? - Oh, neither really. I'm just from up the Ridge. - You're awful young to be out on your own. - I'm almost 18, Ma'am. Thank you, have a good day. - Is that you, Daddy? - Elizabeth. - Hi, Daddy. What brings you into town this afternoon? - Oh, thank you, darling. - Of course. - I heard you got in the car with some young man yesterday and headed outta town. - You spying on me, Daddy? - Spying is such a harsh word. - He's not a stranger, he's a hero. Did you hear about that man who saved Paul Wells at the mill? So you can see he's not all that scary. - I heard you helped in that rescue as well. That's my girl. What do you know about him? That's what makes him a stranger. - Hi, can I help you? - Y'all got anything to drink around here? - I can pour you a glass of sweet tea. That's not exactly what I'm in the market for, young lady. - There's a little thing called prohibition, sir. We don't break the law here. - Well then I guess I'll just take some sugar and corn mash then. - I can get you the sugar, but the mash is gonna be over at the mill. - Well, that's about ignorant. - I believe your time here is done. - Who the hell are you? - You got no business here. - That's a hell of a way to treat a patron. Show me some respect. I could teach you a thing or two, young lady. Oh. - Daddy! - All right, looks like somebody struck a nerve. - Hey, big spender. - Howdy, Ma'am. - Howdy Ma'am, that's all you got to say? - Ma'am? - You are quite the talk about town, you know. A real life hero. Oh, and humble too. - All in a day's work. - I spoke too soon. - I better get going, Mr. Wells is expecting me. - Oh, but we don't want to keep the mayor waiting. - Mr. Wells is the mayor? - Where are you from hero? - Around. - Oh, I like a mystery. What's the name a hero goes by nowadays? - Theodore. My name is Theodore Rogers. - Well, Theodore Rogers, you and I made a pretty good team the other day. Maybe we can work together again some time. Welcome to Maysville. - Say, what does a clerk from the general store go by nowadays? - I'm gonna make you work for that one. - Mr. Wells, sir, I have your invoice. - Well, I hope you have a little bit more than an invoice. Like about 110 more things. - Yes, sir. - I must admit I wasn't expecting to be carrying money like that. - You got nothing to worry about. If you have any trouble, use that Colt .45 under your seat. Ain't nobody gonna bother you with that peacemaker in your lap. - Night boss. - See you later, boss. - Good night, boys, see you in the morning! - Say, you hungry? Yes, I could use a bite. - Excellent, let's you and me grab some supper. Have you eaten at that restaurant in town yet? - No, sir, but I must admit I'm kind of short right now. Maybe another time? - Oh nonsense, my treat. I'll tell you, Della makes the best biscuits and fried apples this side of the Mississippi. Well, here you go, gentlemen. Excuse me. Will you be having any iced tea with that or coffee? - Coffee? Thanks, Della. You know, son, for you to drive the truck back here today with all that money in your pocket shows a lot about your character. I ain't never let nobody but family deliver for me. Of course, I never had a son of my own, but if I did, I'd hope he'd have character like you. Integrity. - Thank you, sir. - Two coffees. Enjoy your dinner. - Thanks, Della. I'll tell you, them taters have just the right crunch. - They look delicious. Say, Mr. Wells, can I ask you a question? Well, sure, son, what do you need to know? - Well, there's this young girl over at the general store. - Oh, Mr. Smallwood's daughter. - Smallwood, like the berry farm Smallwood? - Berry farm, general store, horse farm. Good family. - What's her first name? - Elizabeth. She's the only daughter. Has three sons too. Elizabeth Smallwood. Looks like it might rain later. Thank you for dinner. - My pleasure. Theodore, I think I'm gonna give you an advance on this week's salary. You never know when you might need to buy something at the store. - Why are you being so kind to me, Mr. Wells? - I like you, you impressed me. Have a good evening. - We gotta stop meeting like this. - Well, hello there, Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood. - Gee, detective, that sure didn't take long. You must've been working real hard to get my name. - Maybe. How was your ride to Charlottesville? - Ah, it wasn't too bad. - I'm glad. Do you want another driving lesson? - Yeah, that'd be nice. So, where do you want to go? - Now, where is the romance in asking a woman where she wants to go? Take me somewhere I've never been. You did good, Mr. Rogers. This is quite nice. - I used to play here as a child with my best friend. - I bet you fished and threw rocks and caused all sorts of trouble. Yeah, something like that. You know, I baptized him right there in that spot. - You were a strange kid, Mr. Rogers. What do you like to do now? Besides baptisms and lifesaving? - What do you mean? - For fun, you a wild man? - Oh, no, nothing really. - Nothin'? Everybody likes something. - I like to draw. - Michelangelo, aye? - Michael, who? - Theodore Rogers, you don't know who Michelangelo is? - No, Ma'am, I'm not familiar with any of the Angelo family. He painted the Sistine Chapel. The Creation of Adam? The Statue of David? We're gonna need to work on this. Where are your folks? - They're passed. - Oh, I'm sorry. Your best friend? My, Mr. Rogers, you sure hold some serious heartache. Is your world always this sad? - Up until now, I reckon so. - Well, I guess we'll need to fix that then. - What are you doing? Okay. Yeah. And there's the dress, right. - Oh, it's freezing! - You'll catch your death. - I'm fine. Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine! Baptize me, Theodore Rogers! Wash me of my sins of what I have done and what I am about to do! - You are crazy. - Made you smile, didn't it? No more heartache, Mr. Rogers. - You sure you want to do this? - Save my soul, Theodore. I saw the light. - And we keep ending up in water. - It must be destiny. - Theo. - I need to go. I should get you home. - You'll need to take a right at the fork in the road. - Is this a horse farm? - Yes, but don't go down the drive. Just drop me off at the driveway. - What kind of gentleman would I be if I didn't walk you to your front door? - A live one. - All right. - What happened back there? Are we just gonna pretend we weren't having a good time? - It's hard to explain. - I got time. - Maybe not. - You are saved by the bell, Theodore Rogers. And another thing, Theodore doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. I'm gonna call you Theo or Teddy. - My mother called me Teddy. - Theo it is. Sleep well, Theo. I'll see you tomorrow. - It's pretty late. - Damn it, Daddy. Not spying on me again? Watch your language, you're still a lady. At least I hope so. - What is that supposed to mean, "hope so"? - It's not proper for a young woman to be gallivanting around the whole damn country. Watch your language. - With some boy in the late hours of the night. And don't you get saucy with me. Why are you wet? - Well, Daddy, you have nothing to worry about. He was a complete gentleman, despite my overtures. So, you can sleep well tonight knowing that your young, innocent daughter is still a lady. Good night. - Hello. - Theo. - I hear you have the best sweet tea. - You have good sources. Well? - Mm, yup, that's delicious. Don't tell Della. I'm sorry about last night. I was wondering if maybe you can give me a second chance. - What exactly were you thinking? - Oh, I have something in mind. You know, Elizabeth doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. I'm gonna call you Beth. ♪ Roots can't ground unless a seed is sown ♪ ♪ And trees without a foundation can't grow ♪ ♪ Though the soil of my heart has been cold ♪ ♪ These Kentucky mountain songs have found their home ♪ ♪ My roots are found at the bottom of the Appalachians ♪ ♪ They've been sown in coal ♪ ♪ And watered by a bottle of bourbon ♪ ♪ I can't cut them off ♪ ♪ When I am just now learning ♪ ♪ That my roots were made to grow ♪ ♪ Into this bluegrass I call home ♪ - Mr. Wells, sir. I have your invoice and payment from Jacksonville this week. - Oh, that's fine, Theo. And thanks for all the hard work you're putting in. How long has it been now? - About three months, sir. - Three months. Never late, always willing to lend a hand, strong as an ox. I tell you, you're a true asset to this mill. - Thank you, sir. Not to be rude, but I do have someone waiting. - Oh, I see. You got a cold refreshing ice tea waiting for you, I presume? You know, Theo, tea is a wonderful thing. It's cool when you need it, warm when you need it. But you can't let it sit too long. The ice melts. And the warmth wears off. And then all you got is something that's just sitting there. If you really want to enjoy the freshness of that tea, you gotta take the necessary steps. Now, don't be pussyfooting around. - We still talking about tea, Mr. Wells? You tell me. Do you know, Theodore. I've never held the hand of a woman after church. Or carried a child to his bed to tuck him in at night. Don't make the same mistakes I made, son. Don't let time slip away. You're back a little early. - Oh, light load in Jackson. - Extra sweet, just like you. - Oh. - What? - You're wearing pants. - Yes, is that a problem? You know, I vote too. - I've just never seen a woman wear pants before. - Well, there's a lot of things in me you haven't seen, Theo Rogers. Imagine what's in store for you. - Keep talking like that and you might have just a little kiss. - You do that in this town square and this town would lock you up so fast. - Oh, I'll take my chances. - Oh, I have a gift for you. It's a collection of Michelangelo's work. The Sistine Chapel is on page 72. - Wow, thank you. - Mm-hmm. - You know I was thinking I might take you somewhere tonight. - You taking me back for another dip in the creek? You feeling sinful? - Oh, not quite. How about picking you up at six? Don't keep me waiting. - Theo, you can't be doing that in public. - Sorry, I guess I can't help myself. Sometimes you're just more than I can handle. Say, you know that man? Never seen him in town before. - He comes into the store every so often. I don't know his name. But he always smells like whiskey. I guess every town needs a town drunk. - Yeah, I guess. Thank you for the tea. You know it means a lot. I'm grateful for every time you give me this. And the book. I can't wait to read through it. - Well, as long as you'll let me, I will always have a tea for you, but now I have to get back to the store. I will see you tonight. That was quite the display out there. - Whatever do you mean? - You've been seeing that boy for some time now. - That boy has a name. - I think it's time you bring him by. - Why, Daddy? So, you can tell him that he's not good enough for your only daughter? - Now that's just not fair. - What's fair, Daddy? Are you telling me you're gonna welcome him with open arms and say, "Welcome to the family, son." - You gotta give me a chance first. He can't be all that bad if you care about him. - Now, Daddy, don't you go be an all supportive on me. - I'll give him a chance, Elizabeth. - That's all I can ask for, Daddy. Your move. Where are we, Theo? This is my home, I grew up here. - It's beautiful. Theo, this is wonderful. Oh. Well, thank you. You have green beans! - Yes, I do. - Did you make those? - I did. - They look incredible. - And... - Did you get those from Della? - No, all me. - Well, color me impressed. - Well, I hope you're hungry. Should still be warm. - It looks perfect. - You haven't even tasted it yet. - I don't need to. And you have such a lovely home. - I tried to clean it a bit. It has sat its spell. It could use a woman's touch. - I agree. - Dinner was lovely. Where'd you learn to cook like that? - I used to cook for a man I worked for once. - Oh. Well, I would let you cook for me anytime, but don't break my egg yolks, whatever you do. Theo? Theo. Do you mind telling me what happened in there? Theo, you're doing it again. You're pushing me away. What the hell is going on? - He was not a good man. He was evil, he was horrible. - Who are you talking about, Theo? - The man in town today. What man? - The drunk. He, uh... - Theo, it's okay, I'm right here. No, I'm just being stupid. - Theo. If you do not let me in, if you don't let me close to you. Please, you have to let me help you. - He hurt me as a kid. He hurt me when I worked at his farm. He... - It's okay. It's okay, I'm so sorry. Theo I love you. - You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood. I need to stop here. Some things are just worth waiting for. Can I help you? - It's alright, you can put away your gun. - Ma'am, do I know you? - I know you. - You're from Charlottesville? The Emporium. - I guess you could say that. Teddy. - My family called me Teddy. - That's right. Do you remember me? Look closer. It's all right, it's been a long time, and I know a child's memory fades. - My, how you've grown. - Mama? So, how long have you known? - About a month? Mr. Wells confirmed it for me. He told me about your mother and your sisters. But when he told me about your father and the railroad, that's what I knew it was you. - And you chose to stay away from me? - I chose to do what you wanted. Four and a half years ago you told me that you didn't want me, that you wanted to stay with him. - Mom, I was protecting you. Couldn't you tell? - You told everyone I was dead. - I was told you passed away, and the girls were adopted out. And then I went to Charlottesville and I saw them. It all made sense. Wait, do you know about the girls? - I know them, but they don't know me. The pastor and his wife bringing them around once a month for me to see them. They're very well cared for. - It really is you. - So, you don't hate me? - No, Mama. When I escaped I came looking for you. - Did he hurt you? - You don't wanna know that, Mama. I'm alive, I'm here, we have each other. - You've done very well with yourself. You know, Mr. Wells, he told me all about that boy that you saved. And some other things too. - Other things? - He told me about her. - Elizabeth. - I've seen her. She's very beautiful. Do you love her? - I do. - When you're ready, I want you to give her this. - No, Mama, this is the ring from daddy. - I'd rather give it to somebody who is in love than keep it as a reminder of the love that I have lost. - Thank you. When the time is right, I will let you know. I guess I better get going. Lot of explaining to do. A lot to talk to Beth about. Can you stay? Please, come home. - You want me to stay? - I'll figure this out. You're safe. This is the best day of my life. I'm finally home. - Theo! Thank God. You have never been this late. We really need to get a phone installed in that house. I was worried sick. - Listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. - There you are. You know, I was just bragging on you for your punctuality. - Mr. Wells, look, I'm sorry. - Well, hell! Is that what I think it is? - Theo, you said you needed to talk to me about something? - This isn't exactly how I planned this. - Never is, son. Come on, what are you waiting for? The tea is getting cold. - Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood, would you do me the honor? - Yes, Theodore Rogers. I accept your offer of marriage. - Woo, hot damn! This is a cause for celebration. What do you say we gather all the folks tonight in the Lewis and Clark ballroom. I'll get Della to whip up a feast. We'll have music and dancing and celebrate your announcement in style! - Tonight, sir? - No time like the present. - Thank you, sir. I'm sure Pa would love to help as well. - Now, don't you worry your pretty little head about it. Now, go on, get gussied up. We'll see you tonight. - Yes, sir. I love you. - That is one happy lady. You did good, son. - Thank you, sir. - Now, come on, we gotta get you cleaned up too. We got a party to plan. You're getting a fine young man for a son-in-law. - I don't know, Clarence. Sure don't know much about him. - What more is there to know? He's a hero, he's a damn good worker, and he's head over heels for your daughter. He'll be good to her. - You don't know anything about his family? What he comes from? They could be a family of convicts for all we know. - I assure you that young man has character. There's not an evil bone in his body. I'll vouch for him. - Is that right? - Closest thing to a son I'll ever have. - Thank y'all so much, I sure appreciate it. We're gonna take a short break. Y'all can come on up and grab some grub, and don't forget to congratulate the happy couple. - You look beautiful. - Thank you, it was my mother's. - Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is a great night! We're all united in support of this fine young couple. - Evening. Where are you going all gussied up? - We were just celebrating Mr. Smallwood's daughter's engagement. - And you decided to stand out here on the streets alone? You looking for somebody? - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave her alone. I'll be the one taking her home tonight. If you're looking for the party, it's inside, but you're gonna have to leave her alone. - Engagement party, huh? Who's the lucky fellow who's gonna roll into all that money? - He's not from here, you wouldn't know him. None of us do. His name is Theodore Rogers. - Theodore Rogers, you're like the son I never had. And for an engagement gift, I'm offering you a permanent position at the mill. Son, I'm offering you a foreman job. Will you accept? - Yes, sir, thank you, sir. - All right. Thank you, thank you. - Hip hip hooray. Let's all give it up for the happy couple. - Who in the hell are you? - You're supposed to be dead. - Mister, I don't know your name or where you're from, but we don't want any trouble around here. So, why don't you get the hell outta here? - You don't know my name. You don't know my name. Well, why don't you just ask the groom to be here? Ain't that right, Teddy? - What's he talking about? Theo? - Theo? Who the hell is Theo? Oh, he's got you all fooled. You don't even know who you're marrying. Don't that beat all. Lady, you're standing next to a murderer. Go ahead. Ask him, ask him if he's ever killed anyone. - What's he saying? Is it true? - I can explain. It was an accident. - You lied to me. - I would... - How could you? - I would never lie to you. Mr. Wells, I swear to you. I was just a child, okay? I was playing. - Son, I'm the least of your worries, now go. - That's right. You run, you coward! You run just like you did when you killed my boy! My Willy was drug all across that farm, cut all to pieces and dismembered. From your hands! - Mister. - It's not true. - Beth, please, stop. Let me explain. - Explain what? That your name is really Teddy, that you murdered someone? - I told you, my mother called me Teddy. - Oh, thank you for that. You just left out the part about killing another human being. Damn it, Theo, I told my father you were a good person. I am so ashamed. - Will you just listen to me? - How could you embarrass me like that? How would you embarrass my entire family? I could never marry a liar, let alone someone who killed another person. - Damn it, will you just let me explain? - I can't. - If you've ever loved me for even a second, you will let me explain. I will tell you everything. - Where are you taking me? - Little Willy Stamper. You're Buck Stamper, right? - Who wants to know? - My Pa was there. He's the one who found Willy, you can ask the sheriff. - See? Now you all know that boy killed my son. - It seems you and I remember this differently. They were two kids doing something they shouldn't have been doing, yes. It was an accident. That's why no charges were ever leveled against that boy. They were playing with your gun, Mr. Stamper, before they got on that tractor. If you'd been a better father, your son would be alive today. That boy, he ran to get help. He tried to get his Mama to save Willy. He never left him to die alone. He left him to save his life, and that's the truth. - You're not welcome here. Now get the hell out of Maysville before we run you out. - Elizabeth, when I was a child, 13, I was with my best friend, Willy. We were playing bandits with his daddy's gun. Beth, the bullets ran out. We went to your grandpa's farm. - To steal his tractor, I know the story. - No. Because we wanted to be grownups and drive the damn thing. That's when things went terribly wrong. Willy fell, and I couldn't make it stop. - Who the hell are you? - Everything he's saying is true. - What is going on here? - Beth, this is my mother. - Oh, great. More lies. What's next, Theo? Is your dead father going to walk out of the chicken coop? What is wrong with you people? How long have you been planning this charade? And you have been coming to the store for over a month now! And the whole time you were just fooling me into being some part of your big master scheme! My God, I'm such a fool! - No, it's not like that. Okay, I just escaped a few months ago. From who, your mother? - No, from the devil himself. That man in town today, he was Willy's father. And when he died, I had to take his place or he was gonna kill me and my entire family. I survived for four years with pure evil. Being yelled at, beaten, tormented every day of my life. And he threatened to hurt my family if I ever left. And then a few months ago, I went looking for the girls and Mama, but they were gone. And I went into town and I met you. And I still see him. Willy stills haunts me. But he's my best friend, and I never wanted him to die. Never. - Is this true? You did this to save them? - Well, ain't that sweet. Got ourselves a real family reunion here. You showing her your scars, boy? I did you a favor. You spare the rod, you spoil the child. I made a man outta you. You look different. - Leave her alone. - I can still see you clearly. - Seems our little agreement didn't suit you. You left, not before causing me to lose my barn. - You tried to kill me. - Deal's off. Back to square one. - So this is never gonna end? - This is my family now, and you are messing with the wrong... - You better mind your little lady. You don't want her getting hurt. You're not gonna hurt her or anybody. I've paid any debt I had to you. I owe you nothing. - That's not the deal. An eye for an eye, a life for a life. - Your reign of terror ends here, Mister. Do you have any idea who I am? I could have my daddy on you... - Your Daddy can't help you right here right now. This gets settled tonight. - Then take me. - No, Mama. - If you have me, I'll go with you. I'll take his place. - Well, ain't that a twist of fate. Your Mama done saved you boy. - I'll kill you. - Teddy! I love you and I can never repay you for what you did for me and the girls. But right now I need you to put her in that car and go! Go! You best listen to your Mama, boy. - I love you, I'll be back for you. Go! - Stay strong, I'll have my Daddy get you before sunrise! - It's might chilly out. Would you mind if I got my shawl? It would make the ride more comfortable. - Kind of ironic, don't you think? I ended up with you after all. - We need to get straight to the sheriff. - No, he won't help, I just need to get you safe. Did you hear that? - Gunshot. Go. - Hey, Mama, hey. You all right? - I don't know, I don't know! We were arguing and he was... I went to get my shawl. Theo, what do we do? What do we do, Teddy? - We get you somewhere safe. Elizabeth, you take her to safety. - Okay. Theo, are you coming with us? Theo, are you coming with us? - No, I've gotta stay with the body. Send the sheriff, I'll take it from here. It's all over now. Go. There are secrets in the mountains, and sometimes secrets are covered by lies. I know my Mama killed Buck Stamper that night, a secret I hold to this day. But it wasn't until years later she finally told me the truth. - You got this, okay. I can see the head. It's a boy. William. Little William. He can't stay here. The truth was always there. - John will now. I guess we just choose to see what we wanna see. - Think it might be all that drinkin'. First the war, then Mama left him. You lucky you don't have a daddy. She lost her husband and her baby. Maybe we can cut her some slack. - I don't know what I'm gonna do with you boys. You know this can get infected. Look at him, look at him! - My Teddy loved him too. I loved him. You aren't the only one mourning here. - You didn't love Willy. He was mine. You gonna tell him or should I? He killed his own brother. - You can't haunt me anymore. Now, we are full-on blood brothers. Can't nobody ever take us apart. - Rest in peace, Willy.
