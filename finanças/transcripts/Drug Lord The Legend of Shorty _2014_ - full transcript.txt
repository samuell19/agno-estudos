THE STORY GOES THAT 20 MEN WERE SENT TO BUILD A TOWN. HERE IS WHERE A LEGEND WAS MADE. CHAPO GUZMAN, IN MY OPINION, IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINAL IN THE WORLD, SECOND TO NONE. JOAQUIN GUZMAN LOERA, ALIAS CHAPO GUZMAN, IS ATTEMPTING TO AVOID THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND PERSISTENT PURSUIT EVER. JOAQUIN GUZMAN, KNOWN AS "EL CHAPO" OR "SHORTY," HAD BEEN ON THE RUN FROM THE MEXICAN AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS FOR OVER 13 YEARS. YET, DURING THIS TIME, HE HAD BUILT UP THE BIGGEST DRUGS EMPIRE IN HISTORY. ALONG WITH BRITISH FILMMAKER ANGUS MACQUEEN, I HAVE BEEN FILMING THE DRUGS TRADE FOR YEARS, AND WE HAVE COME TO DISTRUST EVERYTHING WE'RE TOLD ABOUT THE WAR ON DRUGS. WE BELIEVE THE AUTHORITIES KNEW EXACTLY WHERE EL CHAPO WAS AND COULD GET HIM ANYTIME THEY WANTED. SO IN AUTUMN 2012, WE SET OUT TO PROVE THIS BY SEEING IF TWO FILMMAKERS COULD FIND THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED DRUG TRAFFICKER. WE BEGAN IN CHICAGO, THE HEADQUARTERS OF EL CHAPO'S SINALOA CARTEL IN THE U.S. THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NAMED HIM PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE... THE SAME TITLE THEY GAVE TO AL CAPONE OVER 80 YEARS AGO. THIS IS A MAN THAT MOST AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. BUT WE'RE USING THIS TITLE, WHICH WE FIRST GAVE TO AL CAPONE IN 1930. AND THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME WE'VE EVER FELT NECESSARY TO USE IT BECAUSE OF THE VICIOUSNESS, AND BECAUSE OF THE EVIL, AND BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF THIS MAN. IN CHICAGO ALONE, OVER 90% OF THE MARIJUANA, COCAINE, HEROIN, METHAMPHETAMINE, AND OTHER SYNTHETIC DRUGS THAT ARE BEING SOLD ON THE STREETS WHILE WE'RE STANDING HERE HAVE COME FROM THE SINALOA CARTEL. EL CHAPO RAN THE CARTEL LIKE A TERRORIST GROUP. HE HAD A WHOLE RANGE OF DISTRIBUTORS IN CHICAGO OPERATING AS INDEPENDENT CELLS. SO USING OLD CONTACTS, WE FOUND A FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN BRINGING DRUGS FROM MEXICO FOR DECADES. AND JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES, OUR MAN TURNED UP IN A PRIVATE JET. WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, TURN, UH, RIGHT. COMING UP. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL COWBOYS. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. SO, BASICALLY, WE ALL WORK FOR THE SAME GUY. MOST OF US DO. HOW HAS HE MANAGED TO BUILD UP SO MUCH POWER? ASK HIM THAT. I DON'T KNOW. HE'S JUST SMART. SMART LITTLE FUCKER. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT, BUT HE DOES IT WELL. I'M JUST, UM, LOGISTICS, MAN, LOGISTICS. I THINK IT THROUGH AND FIND A WAY. PICK UP KEYS, GO DROP IT OFF, GO THROUGH... YOU KNOW, TAKE CARE OF IT. EASY ACCESS FOR LOADS TO COME IN AND JUST BE DISMANTLED, TRUCKS... TRUCKLOADS, YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY. AND IT COMES... THE PRICE COMES FROM DOWN THERE. WE DON'T SET THE PRICE HERE. IT COMES FROM DOWN THERE, DEPENDING ON WHAT... HOW MUCH THEY WANT, IN WHAT BULK. COULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS, IT COULD BE IN THE TONS, YOU KNOW, DEPENDING. THE PRICE CHANGES. BUT IT'S SET FROM DOWN THERE. THAT'S IT, IT'S JUST LIKE WORKING FOR A COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION, A CORPORATION. IT'S THE SAME THING, YOU KNOW? YOU'RE SUBCONTRACTED TO PERFORM A JOB, AND THAT'S IT. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. IT'S JUST LIKE THAT. IT TAKES A LOOK IN THE EYE AND A HANDSHAKE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU WORK FOR. MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN EXIST. IT'S JUST A MYTH. CAN'T FIND THEM, RIGHT? THE BEST POLICE IN THE WORLD CAN'T FIND HIM. WELL, THERE YOU GO. GO THROUGH THIS. DON'T WORRY, TAKE YOUR TIME. I THINK THAT SORTED IT. WE SHOOT A LOT OF, UH... YOU'VE HIT MOST OF THE MARKS. I COULD HIT THIS ONE, JUST... LET ME GET OUT OF THAT. GETTING INTO THE SINALOA CARTEL, I NEVER KNEW WHAT I WAS GONNA GET INTO. THE EXPANSE AND THE TENTACLES, IT'S A MASSIVE OCTOPUS JUST FLOATING AROUND THE WORLD TO THE LARGE HUB AREA OF CHICAGO, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, UP INTO CANADA, NEAR MONTREAL, AND THEN TRANSITING, YOU KNOW, VIA CARGO CONTAINER TO HONG KONG AND TO THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET. THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET, YOU KNOW, UP TO $200,000 A KILOGRAM OF COCAINE. SO IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW... IF YOU HAD A KILO THAT IT MIGHT COST 18,000 IN L.A., BUT IT MAKES IT TO AUSTRALIA, LOOK AT THE PROFIT MARGIN. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. THE POWER STRUCTURES ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING, BUT WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE IS CHAPO GUZMAN AT THE HELM OF THIS CORPORATE EMPIRE. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY SITTING IN LEBANON MAY NOT NECESSARILY KNOW THE PERSON THAT'S IN BELIZE THAT'S TALKING TO THE PERSON IN SINALOA, BUT THEY'RE ALL COMPLICIT IN THE SAME CONSPIRACY. AND THIS IS A MAJOR ARREST DOWN IN MEXICO CITY, WHERE THERE WAS $200-PLUS MILLION SEIZED. BUT THAT WAS THE WAKE-UP CALL. $200 MILLION. YES, A MASSIVE STACK INSIDE ONE CONDOMINIUM IN MEXICO CITY, JUST IN THE WALLS, AND THE CLOSETS, AND... JUST UNBELIEVABLE STAGGERING AMOUNT OF U.S. CURRENCY... ALL FROM THE SALE OF CHEMICALS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF METHAMPHETAMINE. IT'S A CORPORATE OPERATION. IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN A HOME DEPOT OR A WALMART, WITH A CEO, AND DIRECTORS, AND FINANCIAL STAFF. BUT THESE ARE CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURES MAKING MILLIONS ON BEHALF OF CHAPO GUZMAN.

FEW WHO HAD MET HIM DARED TO SPEAK EVEN ABOUT HIS PAST, BUT THE FIRST MAN TO HAVE HIM IN HANDCUFFS WAS RELAXED ENOUGH TO INVITE US HOME. CARDINAL POSADAS WAS MURDERED AT GUADALAJARA AIRPORT IN 1993. IT IS RUMORED HE HAD INFORMATION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE DRUG CARTELS. EL CHAPO WAS AT THE AIRPORT THAT DAY, BUT ALWAYS DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER. EL CHAPO WAS PARADED FOR THE PRESS. THIS WAS THE ONLY KNOWN FOOTAGE OF HIM. WHILE HE WAS INSIDE, MANY OF HIS RIVALS WERE KILLED, LEAVING THE ROAD CLEAR FOR HIM TO RISE TO THE TOP FROM BEHIND BARS. THREE JOURNALISTS I HAVE WORKED WITH ARE AMONG THE 60 THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED HERE IN THE PAST DECADE. NOT SURPRISINGLY, ANABEL HERNANDEZ GOES NOWHERE WITHOUT A BODYGUARD. GRACIAS. ANABEL HAS DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE AUTHORITIES OF BEING INVOLVED IN EL CHAPO'S RISE TO POWER, FROM PRISON OFFICIALS TO EACH OF THE LAST FOUR PRESIDENTS OF MEXICO. ZULEMA RELEASED THE TEXT OF LETTERS EL CHAPO HAD SENT HER IN PRISON. GIVE ME THE LEGS. HAVE YOU FOUND HER? WHAT'S IT SAY? IT SAYS, UH... "NOBODY DIES... "WHILE KEPT ALIVE IN THE HEART OF SOMEBODY. YOU WILL ALWAYS LIVE IN MY HEART." CLEARLY, IT HAS BEEN KEPT, YOU KNOW? NICELY. YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THAT. WHO'S PAYING? SO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED TO HER? SHE WAS FOUND IN THE BACK OF A CAR, AND, UM, HER BODY HAD BEEN TORTURED, AND, UH... TO PUNISH EL CHAPO. YEAH. EL CHAPO'S RIVALS, THE ZETAS CARTEL, BELIEVED THE STORY OF THE ROMANCE AND KIDNAPPED ZULEMA SOON AFTER SHE WAS RELEASED. HER BODY WAS DISCOVERED MUTILATED IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR. SHE HAD BEEN RAPED AND WAS LEFT WITH A "Z" FOR ZETAS CARVED IN HER BELLY AND BUTTOCKS. ♪ YEAH, THE 19TH OF JANUARY, 2001 ♪ ♪ THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT EL CHAPO GUZMAN ♪ ♪ GOT AWAY ♪ ♪ NO ONE PAID ATTENTION IN THE PENITENTIARY ♪ ♪ NO ONE SAW THE COT THAT CARRIED DIRTY LAUNDRY ♪ ♪ OPEN THE GATES TO THE HILLS OF SINALOA ♪ ♪ YES, THE KING HAS RETURNED FROM A TRIP WITH THE LORD ♪ ♪ THE LAST TIME THEY SAW HIM WAS BY A GAS STATION ♪ ♪ OVER THE HILLS NOT FAR FROM HIS NATION ♪ ♪ HE'S FREE ♪ ♪ THE KING OF G-GOLD AND WHITE ROCKS THAT GLISTEN ♪ ♪ HAS RETURNED FROM A STAY IN A FIVE-STAR PRISON ♪ ♪ A MILLION OR TWO, THAT'S THE PRICE OF FREEDOM ♪ ♪ GOES TO SHOW MY STATION JUST AS LONG AS YOU FEED 'EM ♪ ♪ OH, THE 19TH OF JANUARY, 2001 ♪ ♪ THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT EL CHAPO GUZMAN ♪ ♪ GOT AWAY ♪ ♪ THE TEN YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, HE'LL BE DOWN IN CULIACAN ♪ ♪ A CITY OF LEGENDS THAT IS STOOPED IN TRADITION ♪ ♪ THE MOST DANGEROUS OF SEAS, HE'S THE BIGGEST FISH IN SIGHT ♪ ♪ AND ANYTHING HUSTLERS NEED, CHAPO'S THERE TO PROVIDE IT ♪ CULIACAN IS HOME TO EL CHAPO'S SINALOA CARTEL, SUPPLYING DRUGS TO EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. HERE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO WORKS FOR WHOM, LET ALONE WHO KILLED WHO AND WHY. ONE LESSON WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS... TRUST NO ONE. LIKE MANY JOURNALISTS AND DIGNITARIES, WE WERE TAKEN ON THE OFFICIAL TOUR TO SHOW HOW SERIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THE SEARCH FOR EL CHAPO AND THE BATTLE WITH HIS CARTEL. THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO NOW IS EARNESTLY SEEKING HIS CAPTURE AND INCARCERATION. CHAPO GUZMAN IS ON THE RUN. HE IS ATTEMPTING TO AVOID WHAT HAS BECOME THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND PERSISTENT PURSUIT... EVER. HE IS THE... HE IS THE SUBJECT OF A MANHUNT THAT IS WITHOUT PARALLEL IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THREE FATES AWAITS CHAPO GUZMAN. EITHER HE WILL BE CAPTURED AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, HE WILL DIE IN HIS ATTEMPT TO EVADE THAT... OR HE WILL SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER, ATTEMPTING TO AVOID ONE OF THOSE TWO FATES. WE WILL NOT STOP. THIS IS A RELENTLESS PURSUIT, AND WITH A LITTLE LUCK, HE WILL END UP INCARCERATED AND IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. THE REALITY IS EL CHAPO AND THE SINALOA CARTEL RULE THIS TOWN WITH A COMBINATION OF MONEY AND FEAR. WE HAVE MET GOVERNORS WHO LATER HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING LUNCH WITH EL CHAPO, POLITICIANS AND POLICEMEN WHO TURNED OUT TO WORK FOR HIM. HE WAS KNOWN TO GO OUT FOR THE OCCASIONAL EVENING MEAL. EL CHAPO LIVED IN CULIACAN BEFORE HIS ARREST IN 1993. OUR DRIVER NEEDED SERIOUS PERSUASION TO TAKE US TO HIS OLD HOUSE. THE STATE SEIZED THE PROPERTY, BUT IT REMAINS DESERTED BECAUSE NO ONE DARES TO BUY IT. IT TOOK TIME TO FIND SOMEONE WHO KNEW EL CHAPO WELL. ADOLFO SALAZAR IS ONE OF A RARE BREED, A CARTEL BOSS WHO HAS MADE RETIREMENT, AND SO WAS WILLING TO TALK OPENLY. ADOLFO SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE EL CHAPO WAS NOW, BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT HE COULD DELIVER OUR REQUEST TO MEET HIM. WHILE WE WAITED, WE WANTED TO VISIT THE MAUSOLEUM EL CHAPO HAD BUILT FOR HIS SON EDGAR, BUT NO ONE WOULD TAKE US THERE WITHOUT PERMISSION. EDGAR WAS REPORTED MURDERED IN A SUPERMARKET CAR PARK BY A RIVAL CARTEL IN 2008. WHEN PERMISSION CAME, IT WAS THE FIRST SIGN THAT EL CHAPO MUST KNOW THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR HIM. NOW, IF WE DIDN'T HAVE PERMISSION TO GO TO THIS TOWN, WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HANG AROUND THE CEMETERY... THE CEMETERY OR ANYWHERE NEAR THERE. WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE PICKED UP BY THE TOWN PEOPLE. AND THEY KNOW WE'RE COMING, RIGHT? THEY CERTAINLY DO. THE GUARD MADE CLEAR THAT WE WERE THE FIRST OUTSIDERS TO VISIT. AND THEN, WE HEARD A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY OF EDGAR'S KILLING. IT WAS, UM... A MISTAKE. UM... THE SAME PEOPLE OF EL CHAPO KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE IN A MALL IN CULIACAN. AND I THINK THIS MAUSOLEUM SHOWS THAT A LITTLE BIT... HE MUST FEEL A BIT GUILTY FOR IT. THAT HE KILLED HIS ONLY SON. HIS PEOPLE. AS WE FINISHED FILMING, WE WERE TOLD EL CHAPO'S EX-WIFE, GRISELDA, THE BOY'S MOTHER, HAD NOT GIVEN HER PERMISSION. THEN, A CALL CAME THAT SHE HAD SENT ARMED MEN AS WELL AS THE POLICE TO STOP US. WE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE AIRPORT. COME ON, TELL ME, WHAT WERE WE RUNNING AWAY FROM? I THINK WE ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT SPEAK ENGLISH HERE... AND I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT WE'RE STILL IN CULIACAN. AND SHOULD WE STILL BE FRIGHTENED? AFTER WE LEAVE, YES. CLEARLY, THE DEATH OF EDGAR REMAINS AN OPEN WOUND BETWEEN EL CHAPO AND HIS EX-WIFE. EL FLACO WAS WITH EL CHAPO AT THE TIME OF EDGAR'S KILLING IN 2008. PUBLICLY, ANOTHER CARTEL WAS BLAMED FOR THE MURDER OF EDGAR. EL CHAPO TURNED CULIACAN INTO A WAR ZONE. RIVAL CARTELS BEGAN LEAVING BODIES WITH MESSAGES, CLAIMING THAT EL CHAPO AND THE GOVERNMENT WERE WORKING TOGETHER. IT TOOK ANOTHER TRIP TO CULIACAN AND SECRET MEETINGS WITH SENIOR CARTEL BOSSES BEFORE WE COULD TAKE THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS EL CHAPO. BUT WE WERE WARNED IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO TRAVEL BY LAND INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITH A GRINGO. THAT IS WHY WE WERE INTRODUCED TO EL CHINO AND HEARD THE SONG OF HIS LIFE. NONE OF THE GUNS OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE HAD SCARED US HALF AS MUCH AS SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE RUNWAY WITH EL CHINO, NO FLIGHT PLAN, AND ONLY A VAGUE IDEA OF WHERE WE WERE GOING. THAT NIGHT, WE SLEPT IN THE HEART OF THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE. ANGUS WAS WATCHED LIKE A SPY BY HEAVILY ARMED MEN WHO HAD ONLY SEEN GRINGOS ON TV. OUR HOST WAS THE LOCAL SINALOA WARLORD WHO OWNS THE HILLS AND VALLEYS AROUND. LUNCH FOR EL CHAPO'S ARMY, SOME OF THE MOST WANTED MEN IN MEXICO, WAS BEEF, BEER, AND COCAINE. OUR IDENTITIES WERE CHECKED ON THEIR HIGH-SPEED INTERNET NETWORK. BOTH OF US SENSED EL CHAPO REALLY WAS CLOSE BY. THEY TOLD US THE MILITARY REGULARLY SENDS IN HELICOPTERS, AND WE WORRIED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. THEY REASSURED US THAT THEY GOT THREE HOURS WARNING BEFORE ANY RAIDS. THESE MEN SMUGGLE COCAINE AND METH ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT THE HEROIN AND MARIJUANA GROWN HERE STILL BRING THE CARTEL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT WAS STRANGE, FLYING WITH THE TROOPS OVER LA SIERRA, LOOKING FOR EL CHAPO AND HIS MEN WHEN WE NOW KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON BENEATH. WE WONDERED WHICH OF THESE MEN, OR THEIR OFFICERS, OR THE GENERALS ABOVE THEM, WAS WORKING FOR THE CARTEL. I ASSURE YOU THAT CHAPO GUZMAN IS NOT OUT FLITTING ABOUT IN RESTAURANTS AND LIVING THE HIGH LIFE. IN FACT, WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE DETAILS, WE CAN TELL YOU THAT HE'S MUCH CLOSER TO THE SADDAM HUSSEIN MODEL, LIVING IN A SPIDER HOLE AND MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT HE'S GONNA BE CAPTURED. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT NEEDS TO STAY UNTIL WE GET HIM. HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S DOING THAT? NOT GONNA SAY. WE KNOW, BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW WE KNOW. JUST AS WE WERE PREPARING TO MAKE CONTACT AGAIN, A PHONE WAS FOUND DURING A MILITARY RAID. ON IT WAS FILM OF EL CHAPO INTERROGATING A MAN TIED UP WITH HIS TROUSERS AROUND HIS ANKLES. HERE WAS THE BRUTAL REALITY OF THE MAN WE WERE LOOKING FOR. YET, EVERY DAY, WE WORRIED THAT SOMEONE MIGHT GET TO HIM FIRST. HE IS ONE OF THE MOST WANTED CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD, MEXICAN DRUG LORD JOAQUIN GUZMAN, ALSO KNOWN AS EL CHAPO. YEAH, THIS GUY'S BEEN ON THE LOOSE SINCE ESCAPING FROM A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON BACK IN 2001, REPORTEDLY BY HIDING IN A LAUNDRY CART. NOW, THERE ARE REPORTS SAYING THAT GUZMAN MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A GUNFIGHT IN A REMOTE SECTION OF GUATEMALA. CONCERNED, I RANG OUR CONTACT. HE LAUGHED AND INVITED US TO LUNCH, NOT IN CULIACAN, BUT IN THE MOUNTAINS, IN LA TUNA, AT THE GUZMAN HOME. NO ONE WE KNEW HAD EVER BEEN HERE. DRIVING WITHOUT THE CARTEL'S PERMISSION IS SUICIDE. BUT WITH IT, EVEN THE POLICE JUST WAVE US THROUGH. ONLY ONE PERSON COULD HAVE ARRANGED FOR US TO HAVE LUNCH WITH MRS. GUZMAN. TWO HOURS LATER, WE WERE BEING DRIVEN UP THE MOUNTAIN TO A PLACE THEY CALL HEAVEN ON HIS DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS. - WHAT HAPPENED? - NOTHING. BASICALLY, THEY SAID THAT, UM... BASICALLY, THEY SAID THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO SPEAK WITH US RIGHT NOW. HE SAID YES, BUT NOT NOW. AND IT FEELS FUNNY BECAUSE WE CAN CERTAINLY FEEL THAT HE'S AROUND HERE. AND THEY CALL HIM ON A MOBILE PHONE, AND, UM... YEAH, SO HE MUST BE AROUND. ISN'T HE JUST BEING... POLITELY TELLING US TO GO AWAY? NO, BECAUSE THE STYLE OF THESE PEOPLE IS IF THEY SAY NO, IT'S "NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH." THEY DON'T PLAY AROUND LIKE THAT. CERTAINLY, IT'S NOT IN THEIR INTEREST THAT WE COME UP HERE A LOT. WE CAN BRING TROUBLE WITH US. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. SO HE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HIS BIRTHPLACE AND CULIACAN, THAT'S WHAT... YEAH, THEY SAID THAT HE SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME, AROUND HERE AND CULIACAN. THAT'S WEIRD, ISN'T IT? IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE FOR HIM TO BE. YEAH... POSSIBLY THE SAFEST. OVER THE FOLLOWING MONTHS, WE WERE TWICE MORE INVITED UP TO LA TUNA. EACH TIME, EL CHAPO DECIDED NOT TO GO ON CAMERA. FOR ALL THE DISAPPOINTMENT, WE HAD FOUND HIM EXACTLY WHERE WE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE. - ARE WE READY? - YES. SO WHY HADN'T THE AUTHORITIES, WHO WERE OFFERING $5 MILLION FOR HIS CAPTURE? EL CHAPO WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. IT WAS SURREAL, STANDING THERE, WATCHING HIS SECURITY PEOPLE OPENLY PHONING AND TEXTING, EVEN SENDING PHOTOS. THE U.S. AND MEXICAN GOVERNMENT SIMPLY HAD TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS. BUT PRESUMABLY, EL CHAPO WAS STILL MORE USEFUL FREE AS THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED DRUG TRAFFICKER. ♪ THEY CALL HIM THE SAVIOR ♪ ♪ SAVIOR OF THE LAND ♪ ♪ ALWAYS WITH BEHAVIOR ♪ ♪ HE NEVER ROSE HIS HAND ♪ ♪ AND THEY TOLD HIM TO LAY LOW ♪ ♪ LAY LOW AWAY ♪ ♪ YEAH THEY TOLD HIM TO LAY LOW ♪ ♪ LAY LOW AWAY ♪ ♪ WE ARE ALL IN THE GAME ♪ ♪ WE ARE ALL IN THE GAME ♪ ♪ WE ARE ALL IN THE GAME ♪ ♪ WE ARE ALL IN THE GAME ♪ ♪ CARTEL DE SINALOA ♪ ♪ CARTEL DE TIJUANA ♪ ♪ CARTEL DEL JUAREZ ♪ ♪ FAMILIA MICHOACANA ♪ ♪ CARTEL DEL GOLFO ♪ ♪ ZETAS SEA ♪ ♪ ESTADOS UNIDOS ♪ ♪ PARA LUCHAR ♪ ♪ AND HE REACHED OUT FOR HIS GUN ♪ ♪ AND THEN, IT ALL WENT WRONG ♪ ♪ SO THEY FIRED IN RETURN ♪ ♪ AND THE LIGHTS, THEY ALL WENT ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ ♪ BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA, BA, DA ♪ SO THEY PICKED UP EL CHAPO BEFORE WE COULD CONVINCE HIM TO SPEAK.
