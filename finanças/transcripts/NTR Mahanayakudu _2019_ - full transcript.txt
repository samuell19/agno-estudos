To all the poor people in this state. We will provide kilo rice for one rupee ninety paise only. I feel very happy announcing this. To all the farmers. I will provide horse power current just for fifty rupees. I promise that on this soil. Our government decided to provide horse power current for only fifty rupees to the farmers. Congress ministers are copying your schemes. And stating them as their own schemes. How do you react on this? Telugu Desam's campaigning itself is bringing such changes. What if we come into power? Hail NTR! Hail NTR! Madam. According to our committee report, the winds in Andhra Pradesh.. ..started changing directions towards NTR. We never lost a single election in Andhra Pradesh till date. What can just a film star do? Madam. He's not just a film star. The people of Andhra. They treat him like he's one of their family members. And even some believe him as their god. His films talks on many social issues. Like dowry system. United family values. Struggles of the labour and the farmers. People don't look at him as a politician. But as a social reformer. We better take him seriously. According to the electoral system. The elections in Andhra will be.. ..in August. That means we have nine months of time. What if we move the elections to January? He will only have one month left. In such a short time. Even if the god himself comes down to fight elections. He can never win. So does NTR. -Namasthe. -Brother... -He's an Eenadu reporter. -Hello, sir. -Tell me. -The election date is announced, sir. The elections that were supposed to happen in August were moved forward by 8 months. January 5th is the polling date, sir. So we need to file the nomination by December 11th. What can we do in 13 days? Good days were brought close. We should thank Indira Gandhi. I always felt that Indira Gandhi would do something like this. That's why... I already got the candidates ready. I came out of the same group right? I know how she thinks. Brother... I'll call them if you can meet them once. These are winning horses. Ex-MLAs, ex-MPs, ZP chairmen... There are anti-social people in this list. Many of them are political thieves. You don't know politics. Rama Rao sir, these people will definitely win. I too fear the same. These people will win. Go and tell your Chalapathi Rao and batch. Tell him that Rama Rao party won't even get a deposit in your district. -Sir. Please check this file. -What Babu? You're staying? Or leaving? What sir? There's a new party right? Many of us seem interested. That's what. Whether I am in student union or in politics. I always work with discipline, sir. What? If you are so disciplined. If the party wants you to fight against your father-in-law. Will you? I am ready to fight anyone if the party wants me to. Even if it's my own father-in-law. Sir. As a candidate I may win or lose. But I will never fail as a party member. Please look at that file once. Strong hearted. What Naidu? They are saying you are ready to fight your own father-in-law! Our party members are looking at me like I am a stranger, Reddy. This is not right. Even if you are a party member. You are the son-in-law to the opponent right? Even if I am the son-in-law to the opponent. I am a party member, right? [Rajashekar Reddy laughs] Don't play around Reddy. -Long live... -NTR. This teacher, who shapes a kid's future.. ..is our nominee. We'll give highest preference to the youth, the educated and women. Can never forget what you did for us, brother. This life saver, who does free treatment.. ..is the nominee from this constituency. ♪ Brother, see how many hands are calling for you! ♪ Brother! Brother! Dear! child, child is slipping, look dear, look at the the child once. Uncle! Oh my god! How is he now? I want to see him immediately. Aunty, don't panic. There's nothing to worry. -I am here with him. -I should also be there right? I am coming. I want to see him. Mom. He's there with dad right! -Everything will be fine. -You keep quiet. Son... I want to see him at least for a second. Ok Ok. We'll reach Naidupeta by tomorrow evening. Why is the sound so weird? -Go see. -Ok, sir. What happened? Sir, it seems like a problem in the engine. Sister... I have got everything checked before we started. Don't know what happened! Even there's no stone struck. But... It seems like that tractor is also going to the meeting. As if you can travel in that tractor! You look so pretty. What's your name? -Purandeswari -Oh. You named her very nicely. Such a unique name. You think so highly of my sister? My brother-in-law named her. What does your husband do? -He had a rusted van. -Ok? He roams around in it. -Sister, careful. -Mom, are you Ok? The roads are in very bad condition. But not for long. Our brother is coming to power. These villages will shine soon. Our country. It had a population of 75 crores. Means? The property of our women who faced death like labour, 75 crores times. That's our country. Sister you stay here. Son-in-law. I'll just come. Son-in-law. That's why... Among properties that can be inherited. Telugu Desam decided to give equal rights to the women in the family. This is not one of my election promises. All my properties. I have divided them equally among my sons and daughters. I started the change from my own family. This is for all those who call me and love me like their brother. For the women of my Telugu soil. This is a gift from their maternal family. My family. Tarakam. Oh my god! Look at this wound! It's nothing Tarakam. Should you come all the way for this? It's nothing? How are you... Travelling in this? Why all this hardship? For the taste of the fruit, you have got to work hard. That's not hardship. That's duty. When are you going to Tirupati? Balakrishna's marriage is on December 8 midnight. After mid night, Ramakrishna's. Can't you make it? I don't think we can. We had to plan the campaigning route. I can't leave father-in-law. So... How come dad won't attend his own sons marriages? He's there for our marriage right? Leave him for now. With just one day in between. Two of our sons are getting married. It's Ok if you can't attend. This is public's time. If I come back, it means I am wasting it. In these designs, get two necklaces ready. For both our daughters-in-law. 80 grams of gold for each. 160 grams in total. This is for Balakrishna's Vasundhara Devi. This is for Ramakrishna's Jayashri Devi. How do they look? They look very royal. [Helicopter approaching] Madam. Whenever you visit our state. It's like a festival for us. We are expecting a lakh of crowd today. That's good. Today in Tirupati, he will come to know. That the victory will finally be Congress's. Hail Lord Krishna. Madam, he's our opponent. But that's a cut out of Lord Krishna. No madam. He is N.T.Rama Rao. He also had his last election rally in Tirupati today. Sir, there's Prime Minister's meeting going on in town. So what? You shouldn't enter until madam leaves. This is our constituency. -We'll get late. -Yes. -Today is the last day. -Sir, please. We had our orders. Please understand. We will lose our jobs. Give your names. After he took his oath, he will give back your postings. Sir, please listen to us. There will be a security problem. Security problem to this lion? Get lost. I will stay here. You do your duties. Father, we need to stop the campaigning before 5. -Yes uncle. -Hari. Indira Gandhi might be our opponent. But she's a lady, who visited our state as an honourable guest. She's the Prime Minister. Respecting her is our duty. It's the culture of our Telugu land. Brothers. Sisters. And all the lovely kids. If the anniversary is of a human. Or if it's of a nation. It will always be an auspicious occasion. It's a day of joy. Tell me brothers. -Whom will you vote for? -[All at once]: Cycle. Brother. As the cycle symbol had no stand on it. The whole village is arguing about it. -What's your name? -Penchalayya, brother. See Penchalayya sir. A cycle that stops, need a stand. Our cycle will only move forward. Why does it need one? [People rejoicing] Andhra Pradesh had always been with us. Even during the emergency period. Andhra Pradesh is with us. I strongly believe that. Even in this election. Andhra Pradesh will help us. What? You started walking a new path. Please be little careful, brother. It'll be new, only until you take your first step. But once you start walking. Any difficult path should come under our feet right? No matter how many parties come into existence. Andhra Pradesh will always be by Congress's side. -NTR is conducting a meeting. -Let's go. Sit down. Son. You have turned so black and weak, son. Forgot to ask. Where are you voting from, son? Tomorrow morning. I'll shave my head for Lord Venkateswara. Will go back to Hyderabad with Tarakam. And vote for our cycle symbol. [People hailing]: Long live NTR. Nothing to worry about him mam. NTR is not going to get more than 30 to 40 seats mam. -You telling the truth? -Yes, madam. -It's not a good sign. -Madam. -Take care of the polling. -Yes, madam. We had to win Andhra Pradesh. Tarakam. It's the first time in India to use electronic voting... Been with him since 30 years. Can't understand him even today. There's counting going on here and he's playing with kids upstairs. -Here grandpa. -Wow. Fantastic! Thank you. Congress party candidate, P Sankara Rao... Won over his next close candidate, member of Telugu Desam party... Puttapaaga Radha Krishna, with a majority of 3003 votes. Oh god. -What is this? -Oh my god! Hail Pathala Bhairavi. Dear king, should I tell you the truth? Or the lie? Superb. Next. Grandpa will beat you up if you lie. Look at me. When the verdict changes with each court. Does it mean there's justice still alive? Or is it dead, your honour? Wow. Fantastic! Rama Rao sir. What Upendra? Tell me. The first result is here. In Shadnagar... In Shadnagar? Congress won. With a difference of 3003 votes. We lost the first seat. The first movie that was released with him as the hero. Shavukaru. It didn't do well in the theatres. After that... From that day to this day. Blockbusters haven't stopped. Fans will come out for a movie star. But not tears, right? I saw everything from the driving seat. It's not his fans who came to see him. It's their stories of struggles and tears. We will win. ♪ The victory will definitely come to you. Don't worry. You just keep going. ♪ -We lost and you're distributing sweets? -My sister told me. First movie was an average. Then came the blockbusters. Ok. ♪ The victory will definitely come to you. Don't worry. ♪ [Continues singing] According to the results from Kadapa constituency, Telugu Desam leader.. ..Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao... ..is leading in Gudivada and Tirupati constituencies. -Wow, we won. -We won. In the Vemuri constituency, Telugu Desam candidate.. -..Mr. Nadhendla Bhaskara Rao is leading. -Mom. What's the status? Yeah. Yeah it's good. Yeah, very good. Add few more birds. It will be very good. According to the results until now... Congress party is leading in 13 constituencies. Telugu Desam party is leading in 102 constituencies. -Hello?-Congrats Rama Rao sir. -Thank you.-Everyone's calculations went wrong. Just your belief came true. You won 202 seats. That's peoples trust on us, Ramoji Rao. I will keep that up. -Good bye. -Good bye, sir. Chandragiri constituency results. Medasani Venkata Ramanaidu won on ex minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu. With 17,429 votes majority. Bhu... Sorry. Hello Rama Rao sir. We did it. Now the power is ours. It's not power, Bhaskara Rao. It's duty. The duty is ours. I mean the same. I'll get governor's appointment. Ok. What Bhu? Are you angry because I defeated your husband? It's not we who had to win in the elections, dad. It's the public. And they won. I am so proud of my father. We won! We won with 202 seats. Victory is ours. Take the sweets. Take take take. Take no! I, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. I, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. Solemnly swear that.. Solemnly swear that.. I will bear full faith & loyalty I will bear full faith & loyalty ..towards the constitution of India ..towards the constitution of India which is established by ordinance. which is established by ordinance. First time in the country. Swearing-in ceremony in a public place. I made him the CM. I thought you would be the CM, sir. As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. I will fulfil my duties with dedication.. I will fulfil my duties with dedication.. And conscience. What Babu sir? Feeling bad about the defeat? Defeat and victory are common issues in politics. We need to analyse it and move forward. There's no point in feeling bad. Of course. But these are not like the previous elections, right? Anywhere in this world... The victor will be the reason for the victory. And the defeated will be the reason for the defeat. But for the first time. No matter who won or who lost. The reason was common. Brother N.T.Rama Rao. [Repeating]: Without fear, partiality or sentiments. Right, sir. I worked a lot for my constituency. But everyone looked at my father-in-law. And forgot the good I did. Many great people faced even bigger defeats. I'll follow the constitution. And the law. To protect all the people and do justice. So... What's your position in the opposition? Position? I worked for the party. But they looked at me as an opponent. I am leaving these politics, sir. I started a business in Tirupati. Vishnu Priya hotels. I swear in the name of God. I swear in the name of God. Rama Rao sir. Place where the Chief Minister sits. Means your place. This is mine. No.2 position. Hello. Brother, you brought us out of our villages and into this assembly. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. How are you doing? -Hello. Sit sit. Take your seat. -Hello, sir. This assembly... It's the Lord Brahma's holy slate, on which our state's future is written. It's a mother's womb that will conceive our people's tomorrows. If we waste even a half second here. It's like throwing out food. Ruling and opposition parties, let's both work together. For sure, CM sir. -How are you? -Good. Your health is not good, right? I panicked when dad called me home. He called me too. He called all the daughters. Definitely not for me. Go ask him directly. -Hello, madam. -Hello. -Oh. Come in, come in. -How are you doing? We are good, madam. Take a seat. The reformation that started from our family. We are applying it over the entire state. We are providing equal rights to women, in their parents' properties. Tarakam. Are you happy? You all hand it together. Whatever the right might be. It starts with the mother. You had to be the first. How will the change occur so suddenly? This scrap was getting collecting from 36 years. Will it be so easy to change? Nothing will happen here. Let's go to Bhaskara Rao sir. With self-respect. All my Telugu women should live with pride. Raju. Move Padmavathi women's university file faster. Ok, sir. -Chenayya. -Sir. In the RTC buses. Prepare a GO, stating that the first four rows are reserved for women. Ok, sir. -Do as I say. -Ok, sir. Brother is trying something new. Let's cooperate. Everyone talks outside the gate. No one makes a sound in front of him. Someone should tell him. Or else he will be left alone, with 6 crore people by his side. Tell him? No one in the party have that kind of courage. Leave them out. A son-in-law can tell him. My turn is done. You try now. Don't wait. Keep an eye on their movements. But they are ministers, sir. So what? A mistake is a mistake even if our own people do it. -Do as I say. -Ok, sir. Uncle. I want to talk to you. Tell me. You are a straight forward person. Great people like you should be in politics. But in politics, we need to move forward, pulling everyone in. Until now you might have heard the pure claps of your fans. And praises that had no selfishness in them. But here, every sound you hear will have selfish reasons behind it. You should listen to them. But should do what you believe in. As a politician. I would never dare to talk to you like this. But as a member of this family... [Phone rings] -Hello.-Hello, Bhu? Father? Ask my son-in-law to come home. Now? Right now. Tell him to start. For the sake of SC and ST. We need to build new wards. -Bhaskara Rao. -Yeah. In every government organization. There's lot of bribery accumulated. We have to eradicate that. We have to fulfil every promise we gave. Ok, sir. I have lot of experience. I will take care of that. You don't worry. Party needs your glamour in the coming days. Act in one or two movies now and then. Leave all this to me. Eliminating unemployment is a very major concern. Reducing retirement age limit is enough. Sir, your son-in-law is here. We are in a meeting here! Ask him to come in. You continue. If you ask me there is no better way than this. -Hello, uncle. -Come in, Babu. Hello. It seems you have a family meeting. Talk with your son-in-law. This day on, Chandrababu Naidu is not just a family member. He's a party member too. I thought about it. You are not with any party right now. Telugu Desam needs you. Sit down. You continue. To look for a solution for unemployment problem. Until Chennareddy government, retirement age used to be 55 years. He made it 58 years. That will be beneficial for people who already have jobs. It creates 3 years of postponement for the freshers. So it's better we follow the old plan. We can't take this decision so easily. There will be a huge backlash from the employees. It's better we brainstorm on this first. -That's not the point Naidu. -We'll give pension to retired employees. That's a relief. But what will we give to the unemployed? We had to give them a job, but nothing else. Do as I say. Ok, sir. Let's meet again. Ok Rama Rao sir. All the best, Naidu. Thanks, sir. Our party... It's running dependent on my image. But only when we all are dependent on the party imagine. It will continue to exist. Party had to be robust, down from the village level. Make it into a strong organization. From today, I am a Telugu Desam party member. I'll work like a servant to the party. Very good. From the Srisailam reservoir. Up to Madras. Through interlinked canals. We can divert the waters. Exactly 406 Kms, sir. Well done Sri Rama Krishnayya. I don't understand why we are giving water to the neighbouring state. How would public take this? From the Srisailam reservoir. Through Velugodu. Somasila. And Kandaleru reservoirs. If water reaches Madras. In Rayalaseema and Nellore. 5,75,000 acres of barren land will get water supply. This demands a lot of expenditure. We don't have that kind of budget. Tamil Nadu should bare a bigger portion of the cost. So... Drinking water for Tamil brothers. And farm water for our people. This project should be named 'Telugu Ganga'. Tamil Nadu should remember our generosity forever. [Commotion] Sir. The situation is very serious. Stop it. What's all this? What is happening here? Sir. They all are very angry. You please leave, sir. We'll take care of this. Officer... Disperse! -We will baton charge if you don't leave. -Stop. It's the same public who's paying you. And it's the same public who gave you that baton. You should use it to protect them. Not to punish them. Enough of this, sir. Please stop. Enough of your acting. We voted, hoping that you will better our lives. You snatch our jobs instead! At least let them do their jobs, sir. -Hit us, sir. Hit us. -Go on. Hit us. -Hit us. -Hit us, sir. Please listen to me once. What profit will I get from reducing your retirement age? You served the government all these years. You are feeling bad that you'll lose your jobs three years earlier. But why don't you understand that this will help the unemployed? Moreover. The government will pay all your pensions. Create new jobs, sir. Which constitution taught you to fire existing employees to provide new jobs? We plan our kids' marriages and higher educations by the time we retire. We live with budget sheets of responsibilities on our heads. Even for our cremation after death. We started collecting one rupee at a time. We are the middle class, sir. If you take away our jobs at once. Should we hang ourselves, sir? What kind of justice is this, sir? -Stop, sir. Don't leave. -Answer us, sir. Answer us, sir. Answer us. -Answer us and then leave, sir. -Move. Stop, all of you. I'll take care of this. First you get inside. Leave, sir. Please. We did not expect this from employees, sir. We never thought that people who loved you so much will insult you, sir. They have no loyalty, sir. You are doing a lot for them. Your self-respect is your life. They hit that today! My self-respect grew with their love in the first place. If not them, who else will have rights on it? Let's think of what we should do now. I'll do something to get us out of this mess. It's you who did all this right? This retirement plan. It's your advice. The thought is mine, I agree. But the process is not mine right? Even if the thought is great. The implementation should also be proper. It's not the right way to point others for our mistakes. What do you mean? Is this my mistake? We think of our posts as authorities. If we look at them as five-year jobs with monthly pay. We would have understood them. We made a mistake. Let's take back our decision on the retirement plan. We should never make mistakes like this again. People from All India Employees Union, Delhi are here. I know some of them. I'll talk to them and deal this smoothly. Tarakam. Tell me? Happy Ugadi to you, Tarakam. To you too. Happy Ugadi. Come Tarakam. Tarakam. To know about the struggles of 6 crore people. And to make their lives better. Our constitution gave me just 5 years. Only 1,825 days. Every second from now on, I had to be with utmost discipline. Even what I eat and how much I sleep should be a part of my purpose. Even if I look in the mirror. I should only see my determination That's why. I want to renounce worldly pleasures. As the only reason to this life. As a mother to my kids. As my lawfully wedded wife.

I am the Labour minister. You know that? The Chief Minister who sent us do. Will divide larger districts into smaller ones. Every district will have an officer. Every village will have it's own officer. We'll expand administration even to the villages. This has to happen. By taking advantage of innocence and need.. Patel Patwari system which supports slavery should be banished. Telangana child should live respectfully on Telugu land. CS sir, get the papers ready. Madam, the budget you gave us. It's not enough for us. Please think of something else. Whatever I say here. You all should just listen to that. And that's final. I am not your PA, madam. To listen to whatever to say. I am a CM. I am the voice of 6 crore people. Rama Rao sir. You might be the voice of 6 crore people. But me... I am the voice of 60 crore people. I am also one among those 60 crore voices. It's not just your job to listen to me. But it's your rightful duty. Madam Prime Minister. Everybody in our state calls you 'Mother'. There is a saying that even a mother won't feed her kid. Until that kid actually tells her that he's hungry. But here, even after I ask you. You are not going to care about them? States are losing their rights. And I am just asking you those rights back. Rights to the states are being suppressed. If the states don't get back their rights. This country's integrity and strength will be lost. You will have no rights here. Ok, madam. Until and unless I get by rights. I won't keep my calm. Or I would let Delhi keep it's. Three Chief Ministers walked out along with NTR. For the first time ever, I saw Jyothi Basu sir follow someone. We had to stop this NTR. ♪ Where is enlightenment in wasting time? ♪ ♪ Where is the night? Where is the day? ♪ Here. ♪ With so much determination in your heart… ♪ ♪ Where is the time to be weak?

I went to him for a small favour in Tourism. He stood up kicking his chair and said, 'Bloody fool'. Have to answer for everything we do. We can't even make a small transfer happen. I came here from Congress only because you asked me to. It's more comfortable there. In politics. It's not possible to be crystal clear. To save our own selves. We had to do few things. He won't understand all that. Ok... Let's do one thing. Let's give him a request letter from our side. All of you, sign on an empty paper and hand it to me. I will take care of the remaining. [Everyone agreeing] As the 12th Governor of our state, a Congress leader, ex-CM of Himachal Pradesh, Thakur Ramlal was appointed. -Welcome, Rama Rao sir. -Happy Independence Day. And welcome to Andhra Pradesh Governor sir. Thank you Chief Minister sir. Thank you. Oh nice. Beautiful. Mother of Telugu. Oh, Mother of Telugu? -Nice. -Let us work together for her sake. Sure. Definitely. He is Mr. Bhaskara Rao. My colleague. Yes yes yes. I know him. -How are you Bhaskara Rao sir? -Fine, sir. You are the new one here. But we are here for a long time right? We worked with Sanjay Gandhi. Namasthe. ♪ He is the one who dreams of the well-being of everyone. ♪ ♪ He is a warrior who will never turn his back to the battle field. ♪ ♪ He is the one who always hopes for the good of this society. ♪ ♪ He is a great leader. ♪ ♪ He is a great leader. ♪ It's Ok. Tell him. Speak out. On the minister in your own government. You ordered an ACB ride. Everyone is thinking that you're performing CM duties like it's a movie. We are ministers for namesake. Government schemes and decisions. We are knowing about them from the newspapers. Rama Rao sir. Among the ruling party members. I am witnessing insecurity feeling for the first time. Because of your methods. Even MLAs and ministers are panicking, sir. You should think of what's possible and what's not, right? Starting a party is possible. Asking for votes is possible. Winning seats is possible. But doing good is not possible? Every promise we did should come true. Everything we do should be transparent. Every scheme we thought of. Should be applied according to the schematics. In time. On dot. Understand? -Understand? -Yes, sir. -Sir. -What? Malignant fibrous histiocytoma cancer, sir. Yes, uncle. Final stages of cancer. -I saw all the reports. -Better we take a second opinion. -Father! -Father, what happened? Is it paining again? -Should I give a sorbitrate tablet? -No. Uncle. Mom. Nothing will happen to you. We all are here right? No matter how much it will cost... I too have money. But I have no time. -It's cancer right? -Mom. Don't tell your dad. Your father... He has lot of courage. But more than that. He has love on me. Promise me. Brother-in-law. Tarakam. Nothing will happen to you. We are here for you. 'We' will live long. Enquire where's the best hospital to treat cancer. There are no hospitals for advanced cancer treatment in our country, dad. What? Not even one hospital! If this is the situation of NTR's wife. What about the poor? I am doing very fine. You please don't get excited. -Lokeshwari. -Father? Tell us, which country we need to take our Tarakam to? It's better you both go to America. You need to undergo a open heart surgery. Dr. Soma Raju suggested you right? That's fine. That's fine. We both will go on a jolly trip to America. America? My heart should be healthy. Health is wealth. You both have a peaceful trip. Leave these politics to me. I'll take care of the party. See you, Bhaskara Rao. Take care of my people. -Hello, madam. -Hello, Rao sir. I heard that Sanjay believes in you a lot. Yes, madam. You too can believe in me. It's a good thing. See mom. Harmonium. You like playing it right? Why did you bring this now? Dad asked me to bring it, mom. Rama Rao sir. This is your second attack. Am I right? Yes. You are right. First attack occurred during Justice Chowdary shooting time. Oh. Your condition is very serious, just like madam's. Three arteries got blocked inside your heart. And we are astonished, how you have survived. -Mr. Venkateswara Rao. -Sir. -Let's shift him to Texas. -Sure, sir. Dr. Denton Cooley is there. -He's the world No.1 cardio surgeon. -Ok, sir. Noori sir. What's our Tarakam's condition? Very advanced stage. If I should tell you the truth. Just few more days. She always thought that her life's purpose is just to live for my happiness. She made me father for 12 children. There's no family planning in those days right? More the merrier. Even then I told her after Purandeswari was born. I said enough. She haven't listened. Our Balayya was born. Two years from then, our elder son died. She requested me that we should have more kids. In hope that our son will come back to us. She's not just my wife. She's my mother who conceived me 12 times. -Dad. -Uncle. Cool down. Do you know the difference between then and now, doctor? At an age of 16. It's the same girl who sat by my side during our wedding ceremony. Is now on the hospital bed, fighting death. -Father! -That's the only difference doctor. -Dad, please. -I beg you. -Uncle. -Dad, please be strong. -Please don't let my mother die. -Uncle, please. -Dad, please be strong. -Rama Rao sir. We'll do our best. Be strong. Ramakrishna? You are staying here right? -Bring some pomegranates if you find any. -Ok, mom. Will do. Had to give him it's juice. I searched the entire area. I haven't found any. See if you can. -Hello Dorothy. -Hi. How is my wife responding to the therapy? She's did well Mr. Rama Rao. What did the doctors say, sister? They'll give radiation treatment to mom, here in New York. Heart surgery for dad, in Houston Me and Ramakrishna will stay here. You go with dad. Ok. What's happening? Won't you be with me? I'll spend this entire day with you. A whole day with me! It's been a really long time. Worries and wealth. Aspirations and anger. Kids and their marriages. Now these illnesses and ailments. How many days it has been since we talked about ourselves, Tarakam. Let's take this as an opportunity god gave us. Among the feelings we have missed, let's share at least few. Ah, yes. Sing my favourite song from Chandirani movie. -Oh Star. Oh Moon? -Yes. You too like this song? For you and me, had there ever been two different likes, Tarakam? ♪ Oh star!♪ ♪ Why are you smiling looking at me?♪ ♪ Oh star!♪ ♪ Why are you smiling looking at me?♪ ♪ You are the moon who sprinkles beauty♪ ♪ You are the moon who sprinkles beauty♪ ♪ Oh moon! O o..♪ ♪ That star! Will smile by looking at you♪ -The systems here are very good. -Uncle. Back at our place. We had to update the equipment like this. Good evening, Mr. Rama Rao. How are you today? Fine doctor. Are you ready for the surgery? Yes. I am ready. Relax. Relax. Ok, sir. See you later. With out the Chief Minister. Ministerial Council Meeting shouldn't happen. That's not protocol. Many out of protocol things are happening here. -What I am saying.. -Keep quiet, sir. Bhaskara Rao sir. I need to talk to you. Just with me? Or can my people also stay? Your people! Anyone from party can stay. Let's go to your chamber? It's Ok. Tell me. What's the link between Old City clashes and the Finance Minister? We don't understand why you keep calling for press meets like these. I don't understand why are you asking all this? What's the link between you and this government? You are not even a counsellor! I may not be in the government. But I am in the party right? I have the right to ask. And the need to inquire. We are also in the party. We too have rights. Should we ask your permission for the press meets? We are talking about the system and you taking it personally? System? What do you mean by system? Look at the Congress party. Everyone there have their own democracy. Do you think regional parties should follow monopoly? There will be a protocol even in democracy. Don't talk without knowing difference between discipline & monopoly. What do you mean? We don't have any discipline? Listen to me. This Ministerial Council Meeting will arise many complications. Ministerial Council Meeting with out the CM? How can you call for that? Is Bhaskara Rao the Chief Minister? Is Bhaskara Rao the Chief Minister? Listen. There's no need to answer you. Everyone in the party is unsatisfied. He might be the glamour of this party. But I am the grammar of it. Even with enough experience and qualification for the CM post. I left everything for the party. Leave all these aside. I need to sit and discuss with him. When is he coming? It's Ok. We both will take care of this. You don't over think. Something is happening here. Bhaskara Rao visited Delhi. PCC Madan Mohan is meeting the new Governor frequently. Intelligence Chief is not here. He came to America with you guys. There's no information here. I already told Apparao to stay there. -He hasn't listened. -I smell something. I know about Indira Gandhi. She'll do everything for the sake of her party and loss of her opponents. Uncle shouldn't take tension in this situation. But we all should stay alert. It's better he come back as early as possible. Ok, Babu. Yeah, Bhaskara Rao. Get well soon. You need rest. Read it. It's the inner feeling of some ministers, including me. I'll take leave. I am one among the party founders. You think that this party came into power only because of you. But for someone who had no experience at all. With what trust did people vote for you? With the trust that a matured politician like me is by your side. With a person like me... When fights broke out in the Old City. To warn me not to visit the curfew areas. What right did the General Secretary have? How dare he? I don't have the power to call for the Ministerial Council Meeting. A junior minister said so. Who gave him that courage? Even my press meets are being judged. Isn't it the lenience you gave your son-in-law? We believe that we cannot travel with you anymore. If you don't change your dictatorial behaviour. We are not responsible for the outcomes of it. There's a crocodile roaming in the skin of a minister. This is not a request letter. An admonition letter, sent by hate. I am expelling Bhaskara Rao from the Ministers Council. Get the paperwork ready. The termination letter haven't reached me yet. I am not the kind of man who will sit and wait for it. I'll go against it. To let him know about the intolerance in the party. I took signatures from the MLAs. Let's change the topmost page. Intolerance will turn into distrust. Don't know how many members support him. Upendra sir. How many are here right now? Ministers and MLAs combined. Can be 90 to 95, easy. A need to build a camp occurred. Call our MLAs from all the districts, as early as possible. The number game starts in few days. That won't suffice. Another 70 people are coming for dinner. Rukmangada Rao. How many rooms do we have in Ramakrishna studios? -How many rooms in the studio? -30. What for? We need to arrange stay for 180 members. -That many! -Yes. It will do. We also have four floors right. What's happening? For nothing to happen. You make the arrangements. Letter of distrust. Request letter from our MLAs to CM Rama Rao sir. Now it will be the letter of distrust, that is being sent to the Governor. Meet me later. Madam... Bhaskar Rao sir has sent the letter of distrust to the Governor. This is the correct time to take the strength into our hands. Rajashekar Reddy and Madhan Mohan sir met the Governor, madam. Do whatever is required. He likes Subhash Chandra Bose a lot. He like his salute even more. Don't know what you're feeling. But for me, it feels like one flag is saluting another. Hello. 92 MLAs of my party are here with me, sir. Good. 57 from Congress. Combining MIM and the independents MLAs... -It's 158. -Correct. Bhaskara Rao sir, these numbers seem like magic. This is the power public gave us. People are my rulers. This second life god gave me. Is dedicated to the service of my people. Again and again. What's your constituency? -What? -He's asking your constituency. Tell him. -Oh, consistency... -Not consistency. It's constituency. Say properly. Mine? I am not here to play politics. I am here to live at your doorstep and stop any bad that tries to enter. Jai hind. The minute I get the power. Every bloody sheep will come running to me. What you said is right. Have you practiced your oath? Governor sir. I can recite it with my eyes closed. Just wait a little more. My order would have reached the parade ground by now. The Governor sent a message, asking the Chief Minister to resign. Governor is about to dissolve our ministers council. He asked you to resign. [People screaming]: Hail NTR. Brothers. Brothers! Listen to me. Sorry, sir. You have no permission to enter. There's no need of permission to question a wronging. I am here to prove my people's trust in me. There are 168 MLAs here. That's people of 168 constituencies. It's your duty to give us a way in. We got orders, not to send you into the Raj Bhavan. Until they take back my resigning order, I am not backing off. And I am not leaving Raj Bhavan either. Ok. They have permitted only 15 members. That too only MLAs. Mr. Bhaskara Rao has submitted a list of 160 MLAs. And he also has a letter of support from the Congress party. So... How will you rule with only just 15 MLAs? You are making a mockery of our democracy. I have come to Raj Bhavan with 168 MLAs. But you insisted only 15 of them to come in. The truth is standing outside your gate. Please do the head count. If we stay here for long, the police might arrest us. Even in the control room, all the MLAs should be in our control. Ok, sir. Take responsibility of the MLAs in your corresponding districts. You take care of your MLAs. You take care of your MLAs. And you take care of your MLAs. Listen to me very carefully. Not even one MLA should go missing. Everyone should come back to Ramakrishna studios. But I am not here to do whatever you say, Mr. Rama Rao. Yes. It is evident. You are here to follow some.. ..unconstitutional instructions from Delhi. I am sorry, Mr. Rama Rao. I don't have time for this. Because I have to go for new Chief Minister's.. ..Swearing-in ceremony. CM? Who is the CM? For the people, by the people. I was elected as the Chief Minister. I am the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. So you have decided not to resign! Then I have to dissolve your cabinet. -How can you do that? -How can you dissolve? How can you! There should be some justice in what you do. You please talk. -What you're doing is wrong. -No. This is not the right process. We will not leave this. We'll fight for the justice. What nonsense is this? You can not do this. Is this the way you behave with a Governor! I'll get you all arrested. Marshalls. [MLAs shouting in anger] You are doing a mistake. This is not fair, Governor sir. This is not fair! Down down Governor's autocracy! Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Down down Governor's autocracy! Down down Governor's autocracy! Down down Governor's autocracy! Down down Governor's autocracy! Bhaskara Rao sir. Are you ready to take oath? With Raj Bhavan as the witness. They murdered democracy. They just rewrote people's decision. They dissolved our Telugu people's future. I, Bhaskara Rao. I, Bhaskara Rao. Solemnly affirm that I, according to the laws.. Solemnly affirm that I, according to the laws.. ..shall be faithful to Indian Constitution. ..shall be faithful to Indian Constitution. Come, sir. Back off. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. -Back off. -Stop. Don't give in to the pressure. We need to keep going with the same energy. The imperialism of India. The imperialism of India. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Don't give into pressure. Down down Governor's autocracy! Down down Governor's autocracy! As the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. I'll perform my duties with devotion. I'll perform my duties with devotion. Don't forget what I said. I swear, with god as my witness. I swear, with god as my witness. Everybody, come back to Ramakrishna studios. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Sir Bhaskara Rao, took his oath as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. NTR and the MLAs who stood in his support.. ..were arrested. And were shifted to the control room. In protest of his arrest. As the party members broke into a violent agitation. The police used baton charge to disperse them. [All shouting]: Hail NTR. Lokeshwari. You had to be at the Madras cancer hospital with your mother right? Mom's not coming. She's very stubborn, that she's won't go without seeing you. We are getting late for the flight. -With help of President's trusted person. -Mom. -Dad is here.-Governor Ram Lal. -Bhaskara Rao have done all this. -You saw him right? Let's go now. Many are opposing him. People's organizations were protesting strongly against him. Tarakam. Are you worried about me? You please start. If you are good. I would obviously be good, no matter where I am. If you are good. I will live in you, even after my death. Tarakam! I am hearing things in the NEWS these days. I stopped to see you once. And wanted to tell you something. Do you remember? One day, Vijaya Nagi Reddy and you.. ..got into a heated discussion. When he tried to pull you away from the public. You even left the movie and walked out. I said, let's buy some buffaloes. Everything will be fine if you get back on your cycle. It's the same even now. No one can take you away from our people. You get on your cycle again. This is a great gift the god gave you. Until this day. Only Telugu people knew who NTR is. But now? The entire world will know about you. Son Hari! -Hari. -Hari. Mom. Dad is going back into the public. Go along with him. Mom. Dad underwent open heart surgery. If he goes into the public... His people are his greatest strength. He has to go to them. Listen. I am going to the hospital. You go safe. And when you come back, come as a Chief Minister. Until then. Even if the death comes to me. I'll make it stand at the doorstep. On last August 15th. There's a new Governor. On this August 15th. They dissolved our government. This is a conspiracy being planed over a year. I, Farooq Abdullah. Used to be CM of Jammu and Kashmir. But our great mother.. ..tore my party into pieces. And with the help of Congress. Whatever happened in Kashmir, 45 days ago. The same got repeated in Andhra Pradesh today. Karnataka will face the same thing tomorrow. In our democratic India. Should every state be under the hand of Congress party? Both the communist parties. Will stand by NTR sir. They will see the end of Indira Gandhi. Not of the same language. Not from the same state. Doesn't even belong to the same political party. But today, we all stand on the same stage. Why? Because of the evil change that overpowered your verdict through the vote. If at all this state had to bend its knee and bow its head. There can be nothing more shameful about this country. Here they are. Bharathi Devi. Is that you? Sir. No one brought us here by force. Do you want to do that to us? Tell me. No one here is staying on force. Enquire if you want to. MLAs should be in the secretariat, right? Why are they here? Rama Rao sir should be in a studio. But he went to secretariat right? He's not in the secretariat now. That's why MLAs are here. You too sit. Food blessed by Rama. Have some. We need to question this autocracy, very strongly. We need to bring down this dictatorship. My heart might stop, fighting this war. But I'll even leave my last breaths for you. Until the justice wins. Until the people's verdict wins. Until these vultures descend the throne. This war won't stop. [People shouting] Long live democracy. The Delhi moved me from my place. Now it's my turn to shake it by the roots. On their won lands, I will prove my majority. Brother! I'll make our Telugu courage, burn like wildfire across the country. Take this tablet. Even I want the justice to win. Naidu sir. Please be little careful. It's not safe to leave the MLAs here in Hyderabad. We must shift them at once. It's not the emotion of a single region. I'll let them that this is the anger of an entire nation now and demand our rights. The slavery, Governor is enforcing on us. I'll expose it right in front of the President. Brother. On to... Delhi. [People repeating]: On to Delhi [People repeating]: On to Delhi [People repeating]: On to Delhi Yes, sir. All the MLAs are coming to Delhi in the AP express. Do something to stop them before they reach you. Thank you. Don't you fear the Chief Minister's orders? You failed to get even one MLA out of the studio. They all were there at their own will.

Let's show them our strength. It's not just the injustice that happened with me. This is the injustice that happened with the trust of 6 crore Telugu people. Let's show them the anger of Telugu blood. Let's shake Delhi throne by its roots. For the Motion of confidence, of CM Bhaskara Rao. The Assembly will gather on 11th of this month. The new Governor, Shankar Dayal Sharma ordered so. On this note, to support Mr.Bhaskara Rao once again. Congress party took a decision. On the other hand, in the religious war occurred in Old City. -Death of 4, had become a political issue. -Come. Come fast. They will talk nonsense, to frustrate and push us out of our limits. They will create an issue somehow and try to dismiss the house. -Be careful. -We shouldn't answer them back? No matter what they say. -It's Ok. These people will keep calm. -Don't react. But NTR sir will keep his pride. Did you ask him to keep calm too? No need. But NTR itself means emotion. Let's see what happens. -Long live... -NTR... -[People demanding]: We need a debate. -Remember this. Our target is NTR. It's his pride, that brought him to the assembly. -Use the same pride to kick him out. -Yes, sir. One little mistake, and we can kick him even out of the Motion of confidence. Naidu sir. I'll tell him. Brother. This is our seat. Please sit here. [MLAs shouting]: Hail NTR. [MLAs shouting]: Hail Bhaskara Rao. Let's go for condolence deciding debate for today. Honourable chairperson. Today in the house... Voting on the Motion of confidence should be the only agenda. Hello, Speaker sir. Under these situations, at this point of time... Should we talk about Confidence? 5 innocent people were killed on the streets of Old City. And we shouldn't talk on that? [MLAs demanding]: We need a debate on that issue. Debate on that issue What are you talking? Sit down. I said, sit down. Please. Please sit down. -Honourable chairperson. -Sit. -One minute. Please sit. -This debate.. ..is being diverted with wrong intentions. It's not religion that caused deaths in the Old City, Honourable chairperson. It's politics. Bloody politics. [MLAs disapproving] You're diluting the main issue. Please. Please, please. Honourable chairperson. Not just for the Old City. If this entire state should get justice. There should be a leader sitting in the assembly. To decide who that leader is. We need Motion of confidence. -That's the only way. -Please. [Commotion] Sit. Please sit. We already have a leader. How can you talk like that? I said sit down! Madhavi madam. This is not the proper way. -Please sit down. Sit madam. -Honourable chairperson. Is this the way you respect the house? Right in front of the Chief Minister of this state. You say there's no leader in the house. It's disrespectful to the entire house, sir. Honourable chairperson. Call for the Motion of confidence. And they will get to know who the Chief Minister is. What more should we know? [Commotion] -You are ignoring Old City. -Owaisi sir. Please sit. -I said sit down. Don't talk. -This is not correct. -Reddy sir. Please sit. -Chairperson, do we need this motion? -Please sit down. -They're wasting house's valuable time. We need Motion of confidence, Honourable chairperson. Your leader should feel shame to cry for a post that he's not fit for. -Sit. Please sit. -We need Motion of confidence. -Please. Sit down. -We need Motion of confidence. -We need it now. -Jeevan Reddy sir, please sit. Did he even know the meaning of people's love? This Rama Rao had no self-respect at all. He had no shame too. His entire life is a huge lie. -What are you saying? -What? -What are you talking? -Stop it. -Stop your nonsense. -Who are you talking about? His heart got operated. Not legs right? Tell us. He's cheating the public. He's cheating them. A nerve from the leg is used in the surgery. Shame, a MLA don't know that. What are you saying? Who are you talking about? [Commotion] You sit down first. Shut up and sit. -Who are you talking about? -Sir... You need to think at least a little! It's true what we said. You sit down first. No one who knew his duties will ever support this man, sir. Whoever stand in support of him are all fools. All his people are fraud. He's not a sage, but a cheat. Please. Sit down. -Please sit down. -It's N.T.Rama Rao, you are talking about. -Have shame. -We need Motion of confidence. Silence. Please. Silence. See how cheap they are talking to a lady in this house, sir. -Sir, you have to stop. -We need Motion of confidence. Why are you keeping calm, when they are talking so shamelessly, sir? The house is adjourned for three days. People are protesting in support of Sir N.T.Rama Rao. As law and order is unstable right now. 144 section was imposed in major cities. 4 died in a firing that occurred in Ananthapuram. CM Bhaskara Rao's test to confidence, that should happen today. Is postponed by Speaker Bhaga Reddy. The assembly was adjourned for three days. More than 30 people died for N.T.Rama Rao. What would you say about that? They are just natural deaths. They are taking political advantage of them. There are fights and religious violence in the city. People think that.. ..you are doing all this to escape the Motion of confidence. Why should I escape it? Along with the public, I also had the support of the opposition. I will win the Motion of confidence. I called all your families and talked to them. The courage of his presence. And the hope for his comeback. Is there in every house. Don't worry about your families. Why worry? We had our brother with us in the studio. Hail NTR. Babu. I know very well about them. If I can talk to him once. I may get a connect. Will try. Good. Get to him. And make him talk to me. Listen, they have asked for 25kgs chicken and mutton each. I brought it. Now they are asking for 25 cases of beer. -Get that too. -Alcohol? If NTR comes to know about this! He will kiss his fist before punching us in the face. Look. We should take care of our MLAs. No one should enter without my knowledge. Or should they leave. If you feel like anything is wrong. Alert me immediately. Babu, brother-in-law will be a CM again, right? Let's make a huge ruckus. That old fellow will react to it. Then we can get him suspended in the name of the misbehaviour with ladies. I don't know. I should call for Motion of confidence tomorrow, at any cost. The Governor is forcing me to. My BP is raising like anything. It seems like I'll have a heart attack, sir. Aren't you feeling well? -Who's that? -Ramoji Rao sir. -Hello?-The Speaker got admitted to the hospital. Assembly will be adjourned for few more days. They will try to get to our MLAs in the meantime. Be careful. [All shouting]: Long live NTR. They cheated our brother. They cheated him. As Speaker Bhaga Reddy is unwell, Alauddin Owaisi took that position temporarily. This great human thinks that ruling a state is as easy as acting in the movies. He doesn't care about the people at all. All he wants is the power to rule. He doesn't want democracy to live. He only needs his monarchy back. -How shameless he is. Doesn't even care. -Madhavi mam. Please. Are you trying to provoke? -My state is like a young girl. -Madhavi mam. If a shameless old man is her husband, he shouldn't live. -You care about women? -What's she doing? Speaker sir. I am taking off my bangles on behalf of them. You just die. -You just die. -Please die. What's the use of your life? Please die. -Die. Die right now. -Go die. Why are you looking like that? -Do you think I fear for that? -Speaker sir. They are behaving very disgustingly. [spits] Please go to your places. You will get cursed by the women of this state. You had to die. I speak on behalf of them all. -Go die. -Please go back.

This house is adjourned for.. ..September 28, 1984. Ex Chief Minister sir. You still look so weak to me. You look too weak. If money is my strength, it will reflect in my arrogance. But this is the strength that my people gave me. You'll hear it in one single call. Why did you remain silent, in the assembly? Mr. Bhaskara Rao. Don't mistake my silence as incapability. Don't forget that silence is a deadly weapon. ♪ Is back-stabbing the new rule? ♪ Andhra Pradesh turned into a pit of fire. People are destroying public assets, in protest against the new CM. From villages to the capital, people are fighting for NTR to be the CM again. Common men are turning into rebels. They are fighting, risking their lives to police fire. Along with the state, this situation had become a challenge to Central too. The entire nation is supporting this volunteer war declared by the public. Did you meet the President regarding the situations of the Andhra, madam? It was a general meeting. Is your involvement there in dissolving NTR's government? That was a decision of Governor sir. He took this step by considering the situations over there. And what is your stand on NTR madam? -Hello. -Hello. -Hello, sir. -Hello. Bhaskara Rao sir. We got orders from the head office, to be neutral. You may not get anymore help from Congress. It's you who encouraged us to do all this. How can you step back now? In this situation. Whoever opposes NTR's party. No matter who it is. Their party will have no future. Sorry, sir. The time Ramlal sir gave you... It was up. You should think about the resignation now. But Rama Rao haven't proved his majority in the assembly, right? You too haven't proved your majority! You are just stopping the assembly from happening. Governor sir. Please give me some more time. Look. Listen to me carefully. Now you don't have support from Congress too. The public is coming onto the streets for NTR. The whole country is looking at Andhra Pradesh right now. I cannot do anything. I am helpless. Please resign. Sometime, even losing.. is also politicking. I thought he's just a film star. He would have no idea of politics. But I failed to realize... That he was born out of people's love. Mom. Call from father. Hello? How are you Tarakam? I am fine. How are you? What's happening there? When will be the day... You'll take the oath again. Now!
