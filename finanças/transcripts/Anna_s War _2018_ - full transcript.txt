SAGa Film, in collaboration with Metrafilms, present A film by: Aleksey Fedorchenko Kill them! Come on! Mikola. What's happening? - Have you heard? - Than? Let's go now. Wait, Petro. Take a cigarette. You still have ammo, give me an idiot. Forget it! They will die anyway. Come on. It's ok. November 1941 Territory occupied by the Nazis. The War of ANA Mirko. Carefully lower it. It is a delicate thing. Local Commander's Office Mikola, help us. It comes from the common grave of the Jews. If we take it with the Nazis, they will ask questions. Help us, we are elderly. Give her here. Look where you are! Why are you here? I'm talking to you! Do you have the flags? While painting, great things happen in the world. Look at this. We're here. Here is Rostov. Outside Moscow. And now the latest news from Africa. We are also in Africa now. On here. Oksana made flags with all her dresses. - Didn't you expect that? - Keep it up! You see? That shadow effect? Stay quiet! I'll draw you. I don't want you to do that. I prefer to draw a map. - I want to make a request. - Name and surname. Kulichikov, Anton Lukich. Wait a moment. What do you want from us? What did you find out? Where do you think you're going, bastard? Finish it. Take him away. Oh! You break everything! Mom, here's a boy. Did you just do that? It's crazy. Jochem! Come here. Go with the others! We need a pass to go to the other office. We will place your order according to the usual procedure. I wait anxiously. We haven't eaten well in a long time. Empanadas will taste delicious. Come with me. I want to see us in the mirror. Just see if you're white. Pst! Pst! Stay there. How many people are in your unit? We need shelter for the officers' families. Children? No, we don't have enough supplies for this. This will be fine. We have oat grains , preserves and cabbages. It's getting colder. It would be nice to have beds and blankets. So far we have been sleeping on the floor. And I walk with difficulty. You can go. There is a lot of work to be done. I don't wear earrings like that. They hurt me. - Are beautiful. - I never wanted to use something like that. Very vulgar. How much are they worth? They go very well with your eyes. Girls, what are you doing? I once had amethysts, but they were violet. These are blue. Can I try them on? - They are heavy. - Yes, be careful. Blessed are you, Adonai, our god. King of the Universe, who gave us the Torah of truth and orders us to turn on the Sabbath light. Oh my leader. I fall. We passed the front line last week. The Germans occupied Moscow. But books first. It's cold and we need a fire. For the victory. Michel, I know how to do this. Take the pad. Perhaps the fireplace is blocked or the construction is poorly done. I do not know either. Do you mean that nobody shot here? Get up! Clean this sty. At your command, Major. They'll be back in the car in five minutes and then they'll be back at camp. You have five minutes. I will control them myself. Make sure everything is clean. I'ts understood? It was never cleaned up. Come on, look. Yes, it has a nest, we have to go up to the roof to get it out. I can't see anything. It's so dark. We need a lamp. The fireplace is damaged. There is nothing you can do. We have to fix it. Are you going to fix it? How long will it take? This is difficult to say. I can't see anything above. It's so dark. Who has a light bulb? I have one here. What do you see? Let's go! It's in bad shape. Several bricks are missing. And above it is closed. We will have to fix it. This will take time. What will we do? Shall we fix it or not? Little cat... We need to place eight tables here. It is comforting and warm. Can I warm up for a minute? Why are you bringing this dog? Want some sunflower seeds? Bura, take, take! Do you have a mouse? Get him out of there. What a dog! You kill all the cats. Why did you leave him? That cat ate the mice. He's already dead. Lucas, Lucas! Leave it! Let's go! Soldier, what is this? - What is happening? - The dog is sick, captain. - What does he has? - He's throwing up. I think he was poisoned. Finish him. Sleep well, my hungry girl. Slowly close your eyes. Hunger is also your mother. But she doesn't complain and cry like you. Child, take this from your mother. Try to see things from the sunny side. When you wake up in the morning the house smells like fresh bread. Sleep now, my dear. Sleep well, my hungry girl. But what about you? Hunger is also your kitten but I don't hear any complaints from him. Listen how he meows As he talks to you ...
