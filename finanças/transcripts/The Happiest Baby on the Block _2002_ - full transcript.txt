When you're a new mom and you're not used to having a new baby around, and you don't realize the crying and the symptoms of a baby, you think there is something wrong with him all the time, every time he cries. What's wrong? Okay, let's put you on your side. Becoming a parent is an absolute joy and most people say it's one of the greatest moments of their lives. But there is no question it's also filled with challenges. Hi. My name is Harvey Karp. I'm a pediatrician, and for almost 30 years, I have helped parents understand and care for their new babies. As you know, your top job as a new parent is to love your baby like crazy. But after you have showered her with affection, your two next important jobs are to feed her successfully and to calm her when she cries. Fortunately, feeding a baby is usually pretty easy. And ifyou do run into trouble, there are many places you can turn for help. Soothing a screaming baby, on the other hand, can be surprisingly tough. I don't always figure this out because he's well fed at this moment, and he should be passed out after a great feeding. But as we can see, this is the coughing, grunting kid. We had no idea that it could be that difficult and that she could cry day after day after day. You know, you get really desperate. Because you do think that you get home from the hospital and you have this image of you with your sweet baby falling asleep, you know, all cuddled up in you. And I swear, it has not been one time that he's done that yet. And it has been frustrating for me as a mother, too, to think that I'm doing a bad job. They never really tell you how intense it is until you live it. Parents are often told that when their baby cries, it's because she's having pains or indigestion or has swallowed air. So you would think that from the swallowed air, he got upset. Right. And yet certainly, he doesn't have pain now, pain would not go away in a second. It turns out that very, very few babies are crying because of gas pain. Many babies are like smoke alarms, they make one big shrieky sound no matter what the problem is. And you can't tell from a smoke alarm if the house is on fire or if you just burned some toast. Many babies blast out their pain cry even when theyjust have a little burp. Although it's completely instinctual to want to soothe your screaming baby, it's not at all instinctual knowing how to do it. Baby calming is a skill. I don't know if you guys know this but there are some cultures around the world where babies cry an average of 30 seconds or 60 seconds. In otherwords, they don't go on and on and on. Their mothers respond to them quickly and the babies calm down quickly. So there's got to be some way to help our crying babies. And there is. Watch Noah, as his crying simply melts away when I use some of the techniques you're about to learn. And then this last part is up and across. This is the belt that holds the whole wrap together. And pull it very tight and tuck it in. Now, you can see that didn't calm him down, but now let's put him on his side. Magic? A miracle? No, it's a reflex. A reflex that all babies are born with, that, believe it or not, will turn off their cries and screams almost like turning off a light switch. You're about to meet a group of brand new parents who came together to learn how to see the world through their babies' eyes, and how to soothe their infants' fussiness. Fortunately, calming unhappy babies is easy with the help of some simple techniques used for centuries by the world's most gifted baby-calmers. These techniques are based on three wonderful new ideas. The first idea is the revolutionary concept called the "4th Trimester." Babies are very immature when they're born. And they need lots of cuddling and rocking and shushing. That's what kept them calm and happy inside the womb. And that's why you should think ofthe first three months of your baby's life as your fourth trimester. The ”Calming Reflex” is an amazing and totally natural way for you to soothe your baby's cries in minutes. And finally, the ”5 S's” are five incredibly effective techniques forturning on your crying baby's calming reflex and replacing hertears with tranquility. Now, I invite you to sit back and join me as I visit with these families and they gather together in a class and in their homes to learn how to help their babies become the happiest babies on the block. God knows you were probably more than ready to have your baby after nine long months of pregnancy. But in many ways, our babies are unprepared for the world. Many parents imagine that their new babies will be almost as bright and responsive as a four-month-old. But unlike animals, whose babies are mature at birth, our newborns are more like fetuses than infants. Baby horses are able to stand and even run on their very first day of life. And they have to be able to do this or they're not going to survive. Our babies are very immature by comparison. Our survival does not depend on running. It depends on having big brains and being intelligent. Our babies are born early. Because their brains are so big, they have to come out. They can't wait inside any longer. They can't wait for the brain to finish its development. So in many ways, the first three months of our babies' life, they're still a fetus. And that's why I call the first three months the fourth trimester. During this fourth trimester, babies often get upset because they're missing the sensations that surrounded them before their birth. So the question is, "What's it like inside a uterus?" Well, there's constant sound. The sound is a little bit louder than a vacuum cleaner. Twenty-four hours a day, that's what your baby has been hearing. There's constant jiggly movement. You can imagine what it's like when you're walking up the stairs or in an exercise class. That's a tremendous amount of movement that the baby is feeling. And then, of course, the third thing is there's confinement. Babies are very tightly packaged up inside the uterus. They don't have room to move around. They're very cozy. Mothers have known, intuitively, forthousands of years, that the way to calm their baby down is to imitate these qualities ofthe uterus. But until today, no one has known why that works. It isn't that it reminds the baby of being inside the uterus. What it is, is that babies have a reflex called the "Calming Reflex." And this reflex is the automatic shut-off switch for a baby's crying. Babies are run by many, many reflexes. They cry, for example. You didn't teach your baby how to cry. You didn't have to teach Sydney how to cry. They're born knowing how to cry. They're born knowing how to swallow. They're born knowing how to suck. All of those are built-in reflexes. Well, an amazing new discovery is that they are also born with a calming reflex that's literally an off switch for crying. If a doctor hits your knee, your foot goes out. It's not any great surprise. You know it's going to happen because reflexes are automatic behaviors. If your doctor hits your knee but does it in the wrong place or does it too softly, nothing happens. For a reflex to be initiated, you have to do it exactly right. And if you don't do it exactly right, it doesn't work well. It's amazing because she'll fight me, fight me, fight me. And then I'll find that position orthat right jiggle and then she just turns into Jell-O. It's just, "I'm there, Dad. Thanks." Yeah, because it's a reflex. And that's how quickly it can work. When you do it exactly right, boom, it really helps. Anyone can do these things. Can anyone learn how to do a knee reflex? "You just have a knack with knee reflexes." I mean, anyone can learn how to do a knee reflex. And anyone can learn how to trigger their baby's calming reflex with just a little bit of practice and a little bit oftrial and error. But unlike your knee reflex, which has only one way of being turned on, there are five different ways to turn on your baby's calming reflex. I call them the "5 S's." The first ”S” is swaddling or tight wrapping. The second is the side or stomach position. The third is shushing or white noise. The fourth ”S” is swinging or jiggly movements. And the fifth ”S” is sucking. The first ”S” is swaddling. Tight swaddling, with the arms down. That keeps your baby's movements from accidentally upsetting her. Yet it often confuses parents and grandparents because at times, tight wrapping will make your baby cry even harder. But stick with it, please. And you will see that wrapping will become your new best friend. You're not going to be successful calming your baby unless you start with the swaddling. But the swaddling by itself will not calm your baby down in most instances. In fact, some babies get upset when they're swaddled, first off. You will be most successful swaddling your baby if you use a square blanket. And be sure it's big enough to wrap all the way around and tuck it in front. That's why mothers around the world have done it for thousands and thousands of years. Because the swaddling naturally makes the baby feel back home. In the United States, sometimes we think that it deprives the baby of their constitutional rights. Or we think that they need their freedom. But a new baby doesn't need freedom. What a new baby needs is to feel protected and safe. Swaddling is very misunderstood because so often people wrap their baby's arms, and then the babies seem to fight and struggle. And so parents give up on swaddling because they think that their baby doesn't like it. Right. The truth of the matter is, babies are packaged like that in the uterus, so they are used to having their hands up. But you can't wrap a baby like that because the hands get out immediately. So even though this is a bit of an unusual position for a baby, this helps tremendously because once your arms are wrapped, as you've discovered already, she won't upset herself by flailing around. The pattern of wrapping is down, up, down, up. Or the abbreviation for that is "DUDU." That's the easy way to remember it. Hey, you sweet girl. So the line goes right behind her neck. And it's down, up, down, up. So the first corner is down with the arm straight at her side. And it's very snug. It's not unusual for babies to fuss a little bit when you start doing the wrapping. Underneath you. Tuck it and snug it. Just a little bit so that arm stays down. That's the down, next comes the up. And we'll bring this up, just up to her shoulder. So this is holding the second arm down. And we just tuck this around. Snug it again and bring it down just a tiny, tiny bit, like you're tying a package. And then the last up is up and across. This is the belt that holds it all together. And we'll go all the way around. And snug it a little bit more. And sometimes you have enough to even tuck around in a little corner there. Okay, sweet girl, now let's lift you up and put you on your side. And very, very, good. If your baby's arms sneak out, the wrapping will not work. You have to keep them very securely at her side. The blanket should be about as tight as the elastic waistband of your pants at the end of your pregnancy. For some babies, wrapping is wonderful for four, five, six, seven, eight months for sleeping. But certainly the first three months is the most important time for a baby. Important time? Important, because it helps her feel back at home. She may struggle and you'll say, "Sweetheart, I know what's best for you. "You may think you don't want to be wrapped up "but you're going to see that you're going to be much happier "when you're wrapped up." Right? You say, "Well, I remain to be convinced." Well, the first thing you do is fold the corner ofthe blanket down. And you put her on top of it so that that's right behind her neck. Right. And it's down, up, down, up. So the first wrap is down, the arm is straight at her side. And you pull it very, very snugly and tuck it underneath her. Tuck it and snug it so that you can pull on this edge so the arm stays at the side. The next fold is up. And right away I'm going to get that second arm at her side and fold this around. It's okay if her legs are straight. It's okay if they're folded. The legs don't matter. It's the arms that matter. Next we do down. But this is very important. You have to do it down just a tiny little bit, kind of like you're wrapping a package. Don't do it all the way, just a tiny bit. And then this last fold is up and across like a belt. And this is what holds it all together. You'll find that swaddling will become the most important first step for calming your baby. Now please watch, one more time, step by step as I do the ”DUDU wrap” and swaddle Ava to calm her down. The first arm is at her side, and I'm going to bring the blanket down and across her body. I'll tuck it underneath and snug it so that right arm stays at her side. The second wrap will be up. I'm going to lift up the corner and bring it over her shoulder and make sure that that other arm is securely at her side. Snug it and bring the corner down just a tiny, tiny bit, just a smidge, and hold it right in the middle ofher chest. Finally the last up will be up and across. This is the belt that holds it all together. It will wrap around and keep both of her arms comfortably at her side. Make it extra snug at the end and tuck it around into a nice little package. Now you can see the wrapping by itself didn't calm her down. And that's usually the way it is. If she's rolled onto her side now or her tummy, let's see how she does. The second ”S” is the side or stomach position. Of course, the best position for your baby sleeping is the back. But for calming a crying baby, the side or the stomach really works the best. Obviously, that didn't calm him down. But again, wrapping is not meant to calm him down. Now let's do the second "S" which is to put him on his side, facing down a little bit. What happened? It's like a reflex. That's right. Let's just roll you on your tummy forjust a second, sweet girl. Let's put her on her back. Now when I put her on her tummy, she got calm. And now I'm going to put her on her back again. Will she stay calm? Well, she doesn't, no. The back is a position of alarm and a feeling like falling. This is a position called the reverse breast-feeding position, and it's just one of the positions that are useful for babies. A lot of fathers hold their babies like this, called the football hold. Yeah, this is comfortable. The body angle is really important. You'll see when you do this windshield wiperthing. If she's more on her back... I've had some kids, if they're like a fraction of an inch towards the back, they get upset. A fraction of an inch toward the stomach, they calm down. If I wrapped Dashell but I didn't do it tightly enough, he'd still be fighting. If I wrapped him and I kept him on his back, he would still be fighting. But when I turned him, turned his sweet little wrapped body onto his side, stomach, it was an instantaneous change. So she said, "Well, the side was okay for a moment but it's not enough." Right. The wrapping is not enough, the side is not enough. She says, "Show me what you got." She says she needs a little bit more help. So, the next thing I'm going to do is add shushing. The third ”S” is shushing or white noise. Now, roll you over. It's amazing. Have you ever noticed how calming the sound ofthe wind can be? Well, for babies, shushing is a hundred times more soothing. A loud shush may seem rude to us, but in a baby's language it means, ”I love you, don't worry, everything is fine. ” It's a loud shush, and in fact, you shush as loud as the baby is crying so that they can hear you. Otherwise, they don't even pay attention to what you're doing. Now let's watch some crying babies as I shush them. And watch their eyes. See if you can tell when the calming reflex gets switched on. See, wrapping itself does not calm him down. No, no. But now let's add some ofthe other "S's." There are many types of strong white noise that work to settle fussy babies. Some parents use white noise machines, some turn radios on to static in between stations or they use the sounds of appliances like vacuums or hair dryers. Or better yet, use tape recordings of those sounds. You may think those sounds are too loud. But remember, in the uterus, the sound your baby heard was louder than a vacuum. Hair dryers can be especially loud. So if you're using one for more than a few minutes, turn it down or move it away at least six feet. Good girl. It's unbelievable. And the fourth ”S” is swinging or jiggly movement. Have you ever wondered why people call newborns bouncing baby boys and girls? It's because they love jiggly movement. Now you can see her head is jiggling a little bit. The head is like Jell-O on a plate. I'm not holding her head and keeping it from jiggling. I want it to jiggle. That's what triggers the calming reflex. If you do this with big movements like this, it won't work. If you do it holding the head, it doesn't work well. The head has to be free to move a little bit. I tried doing that today and I had trouble with it. All of these things take practice. One thing is true. I've been doing this almost every day for the last 20 years. So I do have the techniques down. But having said that, they're not that complicated. It takes some practice but you'll see that once you get the hang of it, it will be completely natural for you. There's something called shaken baby syndrome where the head is shaken so violently that the brains are shaken inside and that can absolutely cause damage to a baby. They also call it whiplash syndrome because the head is going back and forth so vigorously. The movement that I'm talking about is not shaking. It's jiggling. It's exactly the same motion that your baby felt inside the uterus. And you can do jiggly movement like this all day long and it wouldn't hurt your baby. In fact, it's just the opposite. It makes them feel very comfortable, very relaxed, very much back at home. There's stimulation that's good stimulation and there's stimulation that's overwhelming stimulation. The rhythmic, hypnotizing stimulation of the swing is good. It makes her feel good. It's nourishing for her. People often ask, ”Will she get spoiled by it? "Will she get used to it?" Actually, she is used to it. -She used to have it 24 hours a day. -Yeah. So now, if she only gets it 12 hours a day, you've already cut back 50 percent. And gradually over the next couple of months, you'll decrease it even more. But I have no concern about spoiling her during these first three months because fundamentally, she's still a fetus. And you can't spoil a fetus. This is called the milkshake position for obvious reasons. This is a wonderful way of burping a baby. And I'm going to put my feet on the ground. They are about as far apart as my shoulders and my knees are together. And I just move my knees back and forth. You can start by going slowly and then you make it smaller and faster. My hands are open and you can see her head just kind ofjiggling -between my two hands. -Right. And if she gets upset, then you can pick up the speed and do it a little bit faster. And as she calms down, you can do it more slowly. I love this position because when it's 11:00 at night and you're exhausted, it takes very little energy. You can just be resting there and just your knees are going back and forth a little bit. It used to be that we had people in the home to help us or neighbors would come over. And we didn't need mechanical devices like a swing. You would just pass your baby along to someone else and then you'd do your work. But we don't have that help today. I personally have had to rock him the entire time and l have to tell you, my arms are just about to fall off by the end ofthe day. Babies are very sensitive to motion and they love sleeping in the swing. But there are some things you have to know before you put your baby in the swing. First, the baby should be swaddled, tightly. Let's put him in the swing, wrapped, and I'm going to put the little strap between his legs. You have to put it between his legs so that he doesn't slide through the hole. Second, you have to belt your baby into the seat so that she can't fall out. Third, the seat should be reclined all the way back. And fourth, you have to use the fastspeed. The slow speed is not effective. That's the way swings work the best. When a baby is fussing when you put him or her in the swing, you grab the swing from behind and you jiggle it vigorously. This is the Jell-O head jiggle. And his head is kind of going boing, boing, boing, like that, just like it felt inside of your tummy when you were walking up the stairs. You do this for 10 seconds or so. And then once he settles down, you turn it on the fast speed. You can already see his eyelids kind of... Did you notice that? Yeah. I noticed that instantly. He started to calm. That's wonderful. One otherthing that you have to understand about swings, they're not meant for calming a crying baby. You have to calm your baby first and then put your baby in the swing. And the fifth ”S” is sucking. Sucking is like the icing on the cake. It's the last "S" but certainly not the least. Suckling your baby at the breast is one ofnature's most powerful ways of calming a baby. But if you're not nursing or when you need a break, there are a couple of good options ready for you and your baby. For example, you can offer her your finger. Or you can give her a pacifier. Some babies take pacifiers easily but some need a little bit of training. Once she starts to suck on the pacifier, I push down on it a little bit like it's going to fall out of her mouth. I want her to think she's losing it. What is the baby's response? It's to suck harder. So many people think to get a baby to keep a pacifier, you push it and keep it in place. It's just the opposite. You use reverse psychology. The more you do that, the more her muscles will be trained to keep the pacifier in her mouth. Once she's sucking, I'm just going to pull it back. But see how she can hold it in her mouth even when I'm trying to knock it out a little bit? Here are a few rules of pacifier use. If you're breast-feeding, don't give your baby a pacifier until the feeding is going really well. Never dip your baby's pacifier in honey or syrup. And don't hang it around your baby's neck. It's a choking hazard. As you practice the "5 S's," you may find that when your baby is really wailing, he may not be able to calm down with just one or two ofthe "S's." Here you'll notice that the calming isn't quite working with just the swaddling, swinging and shushing. Some babies respond to the side or stomach position and some respond to the swaddling the most. And some babies need it all, and they need it big. Here she's having all five ofthe "S's" at the same time. Some of my patients call this the "cuddle cure" because it works so well for fussy babies. When you're calming your baby, you're really dancing with him or her. And the more intensely she's crying, the more intense you are with your jiggly movements and your loud shushing. And then as your baby calms down, then you settle down. Then you decrease the intensity that you're using. Another reason that I love these five ”S's" is because fathers can do it as well as moms can. As a matter a fact, for some dads, we can even do it even better than moms because fathers are a little bit more willing to be jiggly or noisy. Because it takes that vigorous stimulation when a baby is really crying. So it's great fun. It sounds odd but it actually can be great fun when she cries because you'll sweep her up and you'll settle her down and it makes you feel good. So he's on his side, kind of on his stomach. Right, and the jiggle. And the jiggle, and the shushing and the wrapping. And he's not even sucking right now. He doesn't even have all five ofthe "S's." Now, he's doing fine with just four ofthe "S's." Now that he's calmer, he's not even getting the shushing. When you first started wrapping him, he was so upset, he couldn't even hear what you were doing. He couldn't pay attention. It took him a minute to kind of recognize, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I remember, this is going to feel good." Some parents I know say the sixth "S" should be "sleep." The "5 S's" are great for calming crying babies, and they are doubly wonderful because they can also help your baby nap longer and sleep an extra hour or two at night. Again, inside the uterus, she was getting these wonderful cozy sensations 24 hours a day. So when you really want her to relax and to give in, to get into a deep level of sleep, then these different "S's" will really help her a lot. So I can get two or three hours at night? Yes. Or hopefully longer. Have any of you noticed that even if your baby is sleeping, they are sensitive to these changes? I can't move him from wherever he's sleeping. That's it. That's where I have to stay. Like, if I try to move to somewhere else and get myself comfortable, he's up, and forget it. It's like he has an aversion to his bassinet. I'm like, "Will you just sleep in the bassinet for once!" And he won't stay in it. He has to sleep with us. He has slept on me, literally on me, up until last week. What you've discovered is that you can calm her down. You do all these things, but then when you put her down, she gets upset. Well that's because you can't just put her down. You've discovered that she likes to be on top of you. That makes her feel like she's still comforted. -Connected. -Connected, right. Exactly. You can't leave her on top of you all night long. But there are other things you can do to make her feel as ifyou're still holding her. That's wrapping. And as if you're still rocking with her. That's the swing. And as if she's still inside of you. And that's some continual white noise throughout the night. There are some babies who are really fussy babies who need to swing all night long. Really? And they go from waking up every two hours to waking up every four or five hours because the movement makes them feel reassured. Once you get him calm like this... -I could lay him down? -You might put him in the swing. And you guys have dinner and he'll be getting more and more calm being in the swing. And then you put him into his bassinet, and if he still seems to be moving a little bit, not in a deep level of sleep, you might turn on the radio, onto a staticky sound between stations. With the swing, after a couple of months, you can keep her in it on the slow speed. And then you can go to no speed. With the white noise, you can gradually decrease it. The pacifier, you can get rid of after three or four months. Okay. And even the wrapping, you can phase out. With the wrapping, after two or three months, you can wrap her with one arm out and see how she does. If she starts waking herself up more often or getting more upset, you know she's not ready to have her hands out. After about a week, I went back to visit some of our parents to see how they were doing with the "5 S's." Here's what they said. -Getting that down... -The jiggle. ...thejiggle, is amazing for us because, I mean, it's gone from her being upset for 20 minutes, half an hour, even an hour, down tojust a couple of minutes. It changes your life. The other day when I called you in tears, you're so exhausted and then finally when you talked to me, reminded me what to do, then I was able to come and sit down and just start that jiggling. And I was just jiggling his head, and letting his head jiggle in my hand, and all of a sudden, it wasjust like, miracle. Like, hejust stopped, and he had been going on and off for six hours. The swaddling technique really did save my life. Really? Because I was having trouble settling her down. She was fed, she was changed, she wouldn't calm down, and I swaddled her nice and tight and she calmed right down for the balance ofthe evening. So now that you've learned all these different tools, which are the ones that work the best foryou and Charles? The wrapping, the shushing, and the vacuum. The vacuum works very well with this one. He likes the loud sounds. The "5 S's" have really helped us out. It's gotten me to feel from just a mom who's been winging it and trying everything that I can to help him, to actually feeling like a confident mom. And I feel like I'm doing him good. You just have to come and see him sleep at night and how peaceful he is. He couldn't be unhappy because if he was, he wouldn't be sleeping like this. We were with about 20 members of our family just last week who watched us do this and were in awe, asking, "How did you learn how to do that?" "Where did you learn this?" That's fantastic. So it was great because she settled immediately. She went from screaming tojust calm likethis. How was it before you learned the "5 S's"? I was lucky if I was getting an hour to an hour-and-a-half of sleep. He would wake up every hour, hour-and-a-half. How exhausting. -I was so tired. -Yeah. And finally when he'd go to sleep, it would be like an hour before he'd wake up. And what about now? I had four hours of sleep last night, straight through. It was amazing. Yeah, so that was a big improvement. Big improvement! For the first time, she slept for five-and-a-half hours, which is a record. How long did she sleep for before? Between two and three at a stretch. Well, let me ask you. When you first learned these techniques, what seemed the most helpful to you? I think some ofthe things you can do immediately as you're holding her, like a shush, is very, very good because you don't have to set up anything. A swing, or plug in a hair dryer, or find the hair dryer. You just... And itjust immediately calms her down. Very good. How long was she sleeping before you learned the "5 S's" and what about now that you're doing them? Before we would get maybe two-and-a-halfto three hours. Now we're getting anywhere from four to five-and-a-half. -That's great. -It's fabulous. The "5 S's" are swaddle, side, shush, swing... -And suck. -...and suck. Okay. Congratulations. You now know the baby-calming secrets used by the world's top baby calmers. But please, be patient with yourselves and with your baby. Mastering these techniques is like learning to ride a bicycle. They take a few tries to get the hang of. And before you know it, you'll truly feel like you're helping your baby become the happiest baby on the block. If you'd like to learn more about how your baby sees the world, you can find more great tips and suggestions in my book, The Happiest Baby on the Block,
