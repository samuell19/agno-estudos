Does anyone out there have any Cold War facts of your own, that you would like to share with us in this moment? We're obviously obsessed with this stuff. We could talk about it forever, but just wanna make sure I can open up the floor to all of you. Oh, I see a hand back there. - [Anna] During the Cold War, people were told to hide under their desks, students, just in case there was a nuclear bomb. They thought that would save them. - Oh, interesting. - Duck and cover, right? - Duck and cover, yeah. What's your name? - [Anna] My name's Anna. - Give it up for Anna... - Anna! - Everybody!

Uh, the government did actually write a song promoting getting under your desk to kids as if it was this, like, fun thing to do.

So yeah, that's a real song, and it does not work, just in case you're wondering. But thank you, Anna. Thanks for that. (Van laughs darkly) Um, so, piggybacking off of, uh, that wonderful fact, we've learned quite a bit of information in our extensive research on Wikipedia. The People's Encyclopedia. Just on the context for the Space Race, you know, why do these two countries come together in this way, and that really begins in earnest when, Van? - 1940. The Great Purge. Stalin was paranoid that everybody wanted to kill 'im, which they did. So he was like, "Gather up anybody who might even seem "like a traitor." One million people were killed. Five million went to prison, including the Chief Designer. ♪ Stuck here ♪ ♪ It's terrible ♪ Remember that song? - I do. (audience laughing) - All right! - I do, Van. (audience claps) Uh, so while the Chief Designer was in the Gulag, writing songs about dogs, World War II was raging, right? And in 1941, the significance of that year, amongst many things, is that Russia and America started out on opposite sides. But in June of '41, the Nazis fucked over the Soviets, which led the Russians to run back to the Allied forces with their tails between their legs. - Now, we go to 1945, when? The Allies win the war! - Hey! (audience cheers and claps) - USA, 450,000 casualties. USSR, 24 million casualties. America thrives. Russia is broken. - Mad. - Mad. - These two allies start seeing things differently. They both want control of the world. - And thus, a new war begins. - And thus, a new war begins. - Only this war only... - Only this war only... - Took place behind... - Took place behind... - Closed doors. - Closed doors. - Now we go to 1951, where we get the first weightless dogs. I just did that part. I was standing right here. We remember that, right? - Yeah. (audience claps) Tsygan and Dezik. - How are we feeling about our context for the Space Race now?

But not much progress. The American government is more interested in producing cars, toasters and families than they are space exploration. - Well, we don't have to talk about that, do we? Why does the US press have to go and expose all our mistakes? When the Russians only seem to get their good news reported? "Oo, they got up 68 miles. "They're in the lead!" Dagnabbit! What are the reds doing so right? - They're using dogs, actually. - Dogs? Well, that's horrible. They're man's best friends. Those commie devils. We would never do that. - And yet, they're almost out of the atmosphere. As for us, we are no where. - But, not for long. Mark my words, Bianculli. America will... (eerie synth sounds and beeping) (Nick dings concierge bell) - Meanwhile, in Russia. - Meanwhile, in Russia. - I've intercepted an American communique. - Oo! Well, translate it. My English not so good. - My English not so good. But I'll try. - Eh, heh. - [LBJ] Not for long, mark my words, Bianculli. America will... - 3 October, '57. "Mark my words, Bianculli." - Huh? Eh? Hmm. - "America will "launch a satellite "into orbit "tomorrow." - Tomorrow! But I thought they were farther behind! - Apparently not. We must get a module into orbit before they do! - But we've been busy training the dogs! We do not have a module to put into orbit! - Well, we better make one! (ominous bass beat) - In 24 hours? Without renderings? And only the Sputnik ball completed? There are no legs for stabilization! - Do you want Stalin to send us back to the Gulag? (Chief Designer shrieks) Me neither. We must try. - Impossible! Morale is low. It is cold. Hours are long, days are short, wages are cheap! Oleg! We need funding, focus, time! Funding, focus, time! - No time! Think! - Wait. Don't think.
