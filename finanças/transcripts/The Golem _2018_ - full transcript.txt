Subtitles by explosiveskull When telling the story of our people, it's impossible to separate the truth from the myth. Our story begins long ago in the old city of Prague. Throughout history our people have been demonized. Persecuted. Until one day, our holiest rabbi, the Maharal, reaching deep into the darkest depths of the Kaballah, gave the breath of life to a God-like creation. Shhh. Shhh. Calm down. Calm down. Shhhh. Open your mouth. Shhhh. Shhhh. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Child! Leave! Leave now! But when a man tries to play God, the darkness awakens. And so it did. We're done. You can get up now. Thank you so much for your help. Your seven bad years are over, Hanna. It's time for your seven good ones. Thank you, Perla. Our world is built upon broken vessels, and man is the same. Out of darkness, cometh light. Out of death, springeth life. Out of ruin, riseth redemption. Our bodies are perishable, transient... But our spirit is eternal. And there is the paradox. Can anyone name the elements that combine the Star of David, and represent man, body, and soul. We're all scholars here, Isn't there a saint among sinners? All of these elements together represent the creation of man. And are mentioned in the holy Kabbalah. - Merkabah. - As "merkabah." Three dimensional Star of David. Alright, we will pick this up after we have something to eat. Do you have food, Benjamin? Hanna brought me a meal. Benjamin. It'll be seven years since... At this point, you have every right to cast her away. And start fresh with a woman who will do her duty. I'm not casting away my wife, Father. As you wish. How's my little wolfling today? You know, you're very scary. How have you all been doing? Thank the Lord. Would you like to come in? The children would love the company of a man in the house. Thank you, but I think Hanna has probably prepared something. Thank you for the book. It's the last time, Hanna. Kabbalah is far too dangerous. They say any man just reading these texts could lose his mind, or worse. Let alone... A woman? I'm sorry. I just don't want you to get hurt. You've been through enough. May this act grant us in our time a child. Baby boy. Amen. Amen. Where you going? To study. Hanna. God's here, he's around you. In people, in life itself. The combination of the sacred letters hide in the holy Torah. The holy verses Moses used to part the Red Sea. Merkabah. Creation of man. Be careful of the rocks! Sister, be careful! Come on! You are now purified. I wish Momma and Poppa were still here to see you getting married. They'll be watching from up above. Along with your little Joseph, God rest his soul. I'm sorry. We should head back now. Let's go. We're too close to where the gentiles live. That's the plague, starting to spread again. Whoa. Rebecca and Jacob. Be fruitful and multiply. Replenish the earth like seeds. With many children. Amen! Now the bride will circle the groom seven times. The number seven symbolizes the perfection of creation. And so the couple shall become one. Under the HUPA and united. One by one, my people are dropping like flies, while your kind is out celebrating. Please, this is my wedding! And you're putting us all at risk! Rebecca! What is the meaning of this? Hold my hand. This girl is my eldest. And you, you cannot fight us like men, so you kill us like rats. Cursing us with your dirty spells. We have no part in your precious child taking ill. This plague didn't reach us because we are isolated in this village. God giveth, and God taketh. Hanna, don't. Oh no, oh not this! No! Unless you reverse your spells, and save my daughter, I will show you and your God, who is in charge. Give her to me. I am a healer. If you bring her to my house, I will help her. Papa! Until my daughter is cured, no one leaves! Anyone we catch outside the village will be executed. Are you okay? This is a sign. We must repent. Embrace his will. May his name be praised. And pray... Pray with all we have. With reverence. To that end, I am hereby declaring three days of mourning. We should fight back. I mean no disrespect, Rabbi. But besides prayer there are other things which can be done. We must use our strongest force. You suggest hitting them over the head with our prayer books? With the wisdom of the holy Kabbalah. A woman, speaking of Kabbalah wisdom. Wonders truly never cease. We could use the 72 sacred letters of God, along with the hidden code inside the book of creation and create ourselves a go... Golem? You clearly have no idea of what you speak! How do you even know about that book, and the sacred letters of God? I wouldn't attempt to control the tremendous force of the Kabbalah. It has been done before. Who do you suggest might create this creature? Moses himself, perhaps. I will. You propose to create a Golem, when you can't even give my son a child? We have to stand up for ourselves! Go home, Hanna! Just go home. Remember. Fail... and I will burn this place to the ground. Keep going. Lord, oh Lord. Merciful, ruthful Lord. We beseech thee, save this ailing child. Send a heavenly cure. "And all the people of the Earth" shall see that thou art called "by the name of the Lord." - Amen... - Amen! - Amen... - Amen! - Amen... - Amen! - Amen... - Amen! - Amen... - Amen! Go home, Jew! Rebecca. What have they done to you? I was pregnant. But I lost it, Hanna. I lost my baby. You will sneak her out of the village. She needs a doctor. I lost it, Hanna. The 72 sacred letters of God are hidden in the Torah. In order to reveal the code, one must use the power of the holy merkabah. The holy merkabah combines all of the kabbalistic elements together representing the creation of man. The 72 sacred letters come together to create the hidden name of God. In order to create a Golem, one must use virgin, unploughed soil, from a mountain or forest. The hidden name of God. Let there be life. Joseph! No! Please! Joseph! Joseph! No! Shhhh. Shhhh. Please be well, child. She made this for me. Svetlana. My little one. She's a strong girl. With God's help, she'll be well again. I'm doing everything I can. Please. Have mercy on our village. Nobody stays outside! Stay in your home! Hanna, where are you going? Hanna. Benjamin? You haven't been up in the attic, have you? The trunk... What is this? How long have you been...? Benjamin, please. My God. I'm so sorry. I couldn't bear the thought of losing another child. Benjamin, you can't leave. Benjamin, look at... stop... We need to talk... It's been seven years. Seven years since our boy died. This whole time, you've been lying to me? For seven years? Preventing us from having children, from becoming a family again? Benjamin... You've never been to Joseph's grave. Never left so much as a rock on his headstone. Never shed a tear. Benjamin, please. You don't think losing him broke me, too? I'm done, Hanna. I can't stand the sight of you always with your head in a bloody book. Escaping life, escaping reality. However much you study, however many Kabbalah books you read, you will never get an answer to why God took our son. Because there isn't one. You are a woman. A giver of life. God has assigned you a calling and you are refusing it. You should be ashamed. Shhh. Stop, you! You have been told not to leave the village. I'll come back soon. Benjamin. What's wrong? Where did you get that? It's time to fight back. Are you with me? You fire one shot and all hell will break loose. They won't leave a single one of us standing. She was pregnant. Rebecca was pregnant. A golem is to be only used for protection. For the greater good of all. A golem can evolve. Here. This used to be my son's. Joseph. He would have been your age. It used to comfort him when he was upset. Don't be afraid. It's only thunder. I'll be right inside the house. Hanna? What is this boy? I have done it. I've created a golem. Child, what have you done? This boy saved me. He took on a handful of men with his bare hands... It is a heartless monster, and we must take it back from whence it came before it is too late. He is our protector. Our savior. You have created a pact with the sitra-achra. We have no choice. You will never be able to heal that girl. It is only a matter of time before Vladmir and his men kill us all and burn our village to the ground. You and I, we have crossed paths before. I saw it all when I was a child. I saw you destroy our enemies, but also the ones we loved. Promise me, as soon as Vladimir is gone, you take that parchment out of its mouth, and put an end to this golem child. I promise. It will never die like the rest of us. This is the last time you leave without my daughter standing on her feet. We need to get you some real clothes. It's going to be cold tonight. You can sleep here, inside the house. Mmm. It's delicious. Just the way God intended it to be. Ahh, are you sure that's all I can get you? Yes. Thank you. I should get back to prayer. I'm sorry, I can't. She still has your heart. Thank you. Good night. Joseph! No! Please! Joseph! Joseph! No! You're safe. It's okay. Abigail? They're animals. They're wild animals! Jacob! Jacob! It's time. Benjamin! This is not our way, son. It is now. I'm warning you. Benjamin! No. What do you want? You're murderers! We want you out of our village, now. No one's going anywhere. Where's your gun now, Jew? Papa? Stop! Take your daughter, and get off our land. Now! Shhh. We buried Jacob. Stay still. You were right. We should've stood up for ourselves from the beginning. I'm sorry. You're here now, that's all that matters. He won't hurt us, right? Of course not. He's here to protect us. Join us. What's wrong? I'm fine. He loves music. You should play for him. This music tells the story of our people. Our happiness. Our sadness. Our most sacred moments. Our lives. Our deaths. Sweet dreams. Thank you for the dinner. My pleasure. You don't have to go. In the name of the Lord I command thee, return to the Earth. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In the name of the Lord, I command thee, return to the Earth. Hanna! What is it? We have to get out of here. What are you talking about? It killed Perla. Probably Sarah, too. It is no savior. It is a monster. A demon. He's just a little boy. There's no evil in him. No. Hanna, it must be killed. Nobody's killing anyone here. Benjamin, come to bed. Father. Father, we have to save Hanna. The golem... He kills innocents. He killed Perla. I saw it with my own eyes. Gather ten loyal men, form a minyan. We'll destroy him, with the Pulsa Denoura. No! No! No! No! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Don't kill my boy! Don't kill him! Joseph. Benjamin, don't stop! Hanna. That's not our son. Our son is dead, Hanna. Please. Hanna, please! My... my beautiful Joseph. My... my beautiful Joseph. You will always be my little boy, and I will always love you. Hanna. I'm gonna have to let you go now. Rest in peace, my baby. Subtitles by explosiveskull
