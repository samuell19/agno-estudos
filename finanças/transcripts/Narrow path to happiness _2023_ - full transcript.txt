There is a Gypsy settlement... That's a stupid idea. I don't like that! - Why should it be a Gypsy settlement? - But why not? Gypsy settlement.. I'll come up with something... Our film should not be about that. - Why don't you like it? - I want something good. It will be a musical, you'll sing on a stage. Leave that out dude... It's about two gypsy boys... I don't want to be Gypsy in the film. Why are you pushing for that? So, don't be a gypsy in the film... Why a gypsy settlement? That is not a good idea. It's not. Don't you worry, I'll come upt with the story. - Take care of yourselves. - You too. - Be good. - You too. You too. Disease? Distortion? Or just much-talked-about otherness? That's how public television started its program, in which they talked for almost an hour about how to cure homosexuality. The LGBTQ community association protested in a statement... What should I wear tomorrow? I'm not going to wear that... Oh, Gergo... This one? These two together? I don't even have normal shoes. Wait... No... Hello. - Where is she? - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Sorry, for greeting you like this... - You broke your leg... - Hi. I'm Lenard Varadi. - Hi. Zsofi Kemeny. - Gergo Gagyi. - Zsofi Kemeny. Nice to meet you. - We brought you this. - Thank you very much. You can put it anywhere... Well, this isn't how I imagined our first meeting. - Me neither. - What happened? I was walking on the street and I fell. It’s really uninteresting. Well, actually..., ...we've heard that you study scriptwriting, Yes... So, we need a scriptwriter. We’d like to ask for your help. This is why I contacted you. - Because of the script. - We want to make a film. We would come up with the concept and you could write the script. You know what I mean, all films have a script. I get it, but I thought you’d write it and I’d help. No. I’m not a scriptwriter. You know how to do it. I hope you'll help us! When I was searching online I was looking for a woman. I wanted a woman. - Why? - I don’t know. Because of the topic? So, what’s the topic? There are two Roma boys. They are gay, and a couple. Disadvantaged background and Roma culture. Funky music, lots of dancing with a pinch of racism. So, the basic situation is that a Roma couple lives in a Roma settlement and everyone is against them. Yes, that's true. Each musical ends with a grand finale. Would the goal be a momentous family reconciliation and acceptance? Yes. Music is also very important. Gergo sings his own songs. The story is based on our everyday life... That is what inspired me. So, there are people in your lives, who appear in the musical... That's right. ...who help or hinder you in achieving your goals. Is the script made up of scenes? Yes, scenes, and a musical has songs between scenes. Gergo is a gay... ...guy. You could have an evil mother in the film, who forces you to get married. In front of his hetero friends he plays the macho guy to hide his real identity. He is a pro at it. His talent as a singer was obvious from an early age. He is talented. Yes. I'm listening. My name is... I had a missed call from this number. You probably called us because of our job announcement. Oh, yes, I remember now. So, I'm sending my CV. - And I will call you back tomorrow. - Thanks. That's good. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, Lenard, this is going to be an informal interview. So, please introduce yourself in a few sentences. Tell us about yourself. Where are you from? Where do you live now? My name is Lenard Varadi, and I live in the suburbs of Budapest. So far, I only had some casual work, like being a host at events. I don't have a lot of experience. What did you say? What training do you have? Shop assistant. - Have you graduated from high school? - No. What three words would describe you the best? We could separate the question... ...so, tell us three positive and three negative qualities that you have. Well, I think I'm sociable... And let's say... A weakness of yours, maybe... I tend to make decisions on the fly. Well, we have another question. What was the biggest problem you had to face and how did you solve it? At work? Or in my private life? It can be in your private life. We would like to know about your problem-solving behavior. You can tell us a very simple example. Well, it was really difficult to get a job as a gay Roma guy in the countryside. You have written so many songs. Why don’t you write them down? Because I always forget them. I should record them with my phone. “Birds are flying” would be good? Don’t you think that you should start with your best song? No, I think “Happiness” would be the best one to start with. If you want to get famous. The song will be good after the second rehearsal. - When all the tunes will be in place... - What do you have here? When all instruments are in place we can go to a studio. After the studio, when we have a demo... We'll find somebody who makes video clips... In my opinion, you should think about the story of our musical film. That's what you should think about. It can be half true and half fiction. This video clip should be part of the film. Hi, I'm Adam Kanicsar, the chief editor of Human magazine and we have here with us, Gergo Gagyi and Lenard Varadi. You may already know them from recent articles. When the articles came out several journalists contacted us, but we didn't want to talk about homosexuality. But as you are dealing with this subject we can talk about the challenges facing a Roma, who is also gay. It is hard for every gay teenager to accept themselves... More so in Romani culture. In your case, there are extra difficulties... What are those extra things? The Romani culture. Homosexuality is not accepted in the Romani culture. In Romani culture... ...it is only natural that a boy grows up gets married and starts a family. I was aware that I was different, but it was difficult to accept. You couldn't come to terms with yourself? I accepted that I was gay, I just wouldn't accept that I must hide it. Because when I came out as gay I was thrown out of the house... no food was given to me, it was as if they disowned me. I simply stopped existing for my parents. How did you come out? I stood in front of my parents and told them. What was their first reaction? My mom broke a fence, she was screaming and she threw a tantrum. Honestly, I felt sorry for my father. I felt that it was hard for him. He was sitting there silently... Give it to me. - Tasty, isn't it? - Yes. Taste the yolk. You haven't done anything useful all day. What's happening with the rehearsal? I have to organize everything. Gergo, I'll wash off this shit from my face. Ok my love, wash it off. Gergo, just start organizing the rehearsal already! Hi Csabi! Are you going to be here at 1 pm? Are you? Great. I'm waiting for you. Only checking if anything came up... I think we don't need congas or drums. It's going to be just fine like that. A bass, a guitar, a fine violin, that's it. It's not bad to start with... Here comes the violin. Wait, wait. As you play the guitar, he comes in with the melody. You should play the violin right in the middle. Let's do it! This is not under the verse... This is just the way to start. Yes, he's right. Wait. You do it like that: Here comes the verse. - Do you get what I mean? - Yes, he's right. Gabi! Do four rounds before I start singing. And now... Tears fall from my eyes... and days are passing by... while I'm marching forward, and I'm looking for my life. You're going to be an actor when we make this film. The story should be about us. All that happened to us. A film based on actual events. He very often imagined having sex with boys in his dreams. It happened first when he was 15, the second time when he was 17. The next time didn't happen again, until he was 27. Deep down he knew he was gay, and that he was different from everyone else. The two boys get close to each other which brings a lot of trouble into their lives. It is only Lenard's mother who knows about their relationship, and by accident when Lenard's mother goes to visit her boyfriend in jail, ...as I told you before... that's the point when your family finds out... So, we leave and move to the big city... Just continue reading, you'll explain it later. His family found out that he was gay, when his brother was in the same cell as my mother's boyfriend. Oh, my god... But it's a really great scenario. I didn't think that he will be the one to write the dialogue and... Why not? I will read it and help you as a dramaturge. I know nothing about the topic... I'm not familiar with your background. I've never met anyone who was in jail. - The dialogue is the conversation? - Yes. This has to be so good that they nominate it for the Oscars! Well, why not? Well, first act... ...discovering ourselves... The introduction is when we get to know you two separately, and we see both of you unhappy because you can’t find your place... So, we realize that we are gay. That’s the inciting event. After the introduction. So, intro... - Should I write it? - Yes. - Draft! What is a draft? - I don’t know it, right? We met. Don't you get it? Then the big turning point is that we realize that we are gay. The next turning point is that we move to the big city. Denial, threatening situations... We could also include when I used drugs. Then I stopped using when I found God. You found God first and stopped because of that or you stopped using first? I found God and because of Him I stopped. - Why did you convert? - Because I was a sinner. Because homosexuality is a sin, you know? What can I say? I just choose to not do anything about it. - Of course not. - You know what I mean... So, do you still think God considers it a sin? I do. It has happened to me more than once that I have sat down to talk to someone with whom I had a different view on things. When we tried to understand each other, it turned out that our views were not so far apart. We may express ourselves differently, we may have different experiences, but if we have the openness to understand one another we can get closer to each other. If we get closer to each other we are getting closer to God. I was told not to be gay, because it is a sin. This is when you are expected to hide it, to deny it, to suppress it, but it's not healthy. I think it's not a good thing. For example, I am a white, heterosexual, Christian man. You have to adapt to me! Compared to me, everyone is different. You can't get more stupid than that. I can't even imagine a more demented thought. - Do you consider it to be a sin? - No! I think that God does not create any man He wouldn't want to welcome. So, you believe that what is written in the Bible, like in the third book of Moses: don't sleep with a man, because it is an abomination for our Lord. It's not about the situation when two men make a mutual decision, that they love each other and wish to live together in a relationship. I do believe that such wording exactly refers to this, when two people respect and love each other, and start a joint life together, and they want to take their relationship to God, to sanctify it, and ask for his blessing, that's how they want to live their life, there is nothing against this in the Bible. Wow, that is shocking! It surprises me, to be honest. In a positive way, that you don't consider it to be a sin... There are many people like us. We are only a few around this table, but there are many who thinks this way. Unfortunately, you don't meet them. If it were possible, would you be straight? Yes! If there was a method that could make you straight, would you take that opportunity? Yes! - What about you? - No! László Kövér, the acting President of the Republic expressed his views not only on the dangers of immigration, but also of homosexuals. As he put it: a normal homosexual knows the order of the world is, accepts that he was born like that or has become like that, and tries to adopt to this world without considering himself an equal. My daughter was not happy about my giving a speech today. She feared for my heart. What hurts my heart is not that I have to stand in front of you but such homophobic statements. Every single sentence that hurts my child rips into my heart like a poisoned arrow! Where are you, my love? Well, I'm almost home. - Oh, only there? - Yes, unfortunately. I'm already at the demonstration. We should not accept being treated as secondary citizens! Equality for homosexuals, less homophobic politicians! I'm going to go live on Facebook... I don't really know how it works, usually, Gergo is the one... Would you explain why we were at the demonstration? The statements of László Kövér, speaker of the Parliament were rather offensive regarding homosexuals. He stated that they are not equal human beings. In his opinion a "normal" gay person thinks of himself as somebody who is not equal. So, this is what we wanted to draw attention to: Fuck you László Kövér. I'm not sure about this... - Something like that? - Perfect. I would be happier if you didn't change my voice. Then it will be out of tune. I even have to clean up the violin's sound, because it also goes out of tune. - That's different. - It's not. Believe me! Is everyone's voice cleaned up that way? Even the professionals? - Yes of course. - But why? Because they'll be out of tune. No one can sing that clearly. This is the left, and the right. The music can come. Happiness, I'm waiting for you, Happiness, I'm calling you, Happiness, where are you? I believe it wasn't out of tune. - There were some off-key notes. - But not too many, right? Well, not. Well, let's start to work on it, one section at a time. - From the beginning? - Don't you have auto tune? That's what I've been talking about for hours, that I'll have to clean it up. - It's your first time in a studio, right? - What? This is your first time singing into a studio mic. - Yes. - It's only natural to be out of tune. How could... I didn't... - Let's not fight... - You should concentrate... - Can I try it again? - Of course. Out of tune can be corrected. The software deals with it. That's not what you have to pay attention to. Gergo, listen to him and don't fool yourself. I'm not going to give it up. I'll do it! - What happened here? - Some off-key notes again. Off-key notes is not a problem. Let's do it. We will continue with the verse. - The verse? - The first verse! Happiness, I'm waiting for you, Happiness, I'm calling you, Happiness, where are you? I'm looking for you, but I don't find you. Happiness, I'm waiting for you, Happiness, I'm calling you. I thought we could do the video clip here. I think by the river side would be better. The clip... Let's say you wake up... You squat like this... and the music is playing... - You could put some makeup on... - No, I won't. Are you crazy? How can you say something like that? Why not? You put some makeup on... Gergo, no! We look at each other. Did you feel it? Do you feel it? What's most important is how you act. That wasn't good. But why? Don't make me nervous! - But Leni, like that... - Is this part sad? - Is it sad? - No, it's... But how do I find you? You see? Like that! It will be good like that! I'm looking for you and I do find you! I love you so much, my sweety, my treasure. Well done, my love. Okay my love. This is how you should do it, my love. I would like to try that. I've never done it. How can they skate like that? - I'm cold. - Me too. Look at that kid. He is doing it so well. - Wow, he is really fast. - Oh, wow, he is fast. There is a gay Roma couple who had to suffer, starve and run away from their families only because they were different. Gergo and Lenard experienced all of this, but they never gave up. They were forced to come out when they couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. In a rural town, rumors spread quickly so, they moved away instead. 31-year-old Gergo hasn’t seen his family since. Bread with butter. Or just a piece of bread. That's it! We had to shower at the homeless shelter. That's it! They never imagined that a time would come, when their Roma background would be the least of their disadvantages, and that they would be stigmatized because of their sexual orientation. The boys supported each other and moved ahead, step by step. Nowadays, Gergo and Lenard are living their lives happily in Budapest. But it took them a long time to get here. To people who are disowned by their parents, who are poor and starve, who don't know what to do, I say: be strong for yourself! No one is going to help! I'm serious. What? Okay... It was good. They edited it well. Wow! Is this serious? - Is this my Facebook? - What is it? 20 people started to follow me... Gergo, don't... Let me go... Don't do it! Are you stupid? I will fall and get hit by a car. Gergo! If I fall, Gergo... Did I get very dirty? Wait! Let me know when you are ready. Hurry up, Gergo, before I fall! The tram is coming... Gergo, hurry up! Let's do the verse! Gergo, I am begging you! Don't waste time. I don't feel comfortable up here. - I am really afraid of heights! - Look at me! Wait Gergo! We should do the other verse! The one that goes: "I'm looking for you and I can't find you." The other one goes: "I'm looking for you and I know I'll find you." I'm sorry... How many more minutes is this going to take? - Please... - Only twenty seconds. I can't help it. I'm shaking... hurry up! From the other side too. Look that way. Don't look into the camera! Tears falls from my eyes, and days are passing by, while I'm marching forward, and I'm looking for my life, I'm marching forward all alone, and I'm a wandering soul. For years, I can't find what I want. ...I can't find... Tell them that I won't give autographs. Come and check it out. The story of Lenard. Let's switch places. - Both of us can fit here... - No, we can't. Solve it somehow... - Ok, I'll move over... - What are these spelling mistakes? Oh my God, so many red marks... I had to witness every day the fights between my parents. I saw how my mom couldn't stand it anymore. Any given day after school... Mom was upset, my father was at the pub every night... We have to put a full stop there. It’s not bad, but you need to work on it more. It’s a bit rough. It's very raw, and... My life. That's the title of your document as well? Yes. My mother was always like a dog with a bone. My uncles told me that she was like that even as a little girl. She was always the boss at home. And it was going to be like that forever. At that point I had a good relationship with my parents. Honestly, I would have never thought that I'd be where I am now. I'm really getting to know your life. What can I say? She disowned me... She pushed me away. I can't do anything now. It really hurts. It's depressing. Your music video was going to debut this week. I would have bought her the world! It would have been nice if you could have made a living from performing... Oh, my darling... Please don't cry! Lived for 59 years. - Hi. - Hello. Zsofi, look at her, how pretty she is! - Did you have a date? - I will have one after this. Really? - Hi. - Hi. - So good to see you! - Good to see you too! - Hi. - Hi. Actually, this is my classroom. - Really? - I spend my weekdays here... More or less... - In this room? - Yes. - What do you study here? - Scriptwriting. I want to include that we break up and Gergo is a big star already and I see posters of him around the city and we are separated... - And he will... - I don't like it. - And our families come... - I don't like it... - But I like it. - I don't like it. I don't like the break-up. I don't like the happy endings... - All films end with a kiss... - You don't want a happy ending? The happy ending will eventually come, but the final goal is the acceptance of your families. The climax is the complication... The starving... ...the exclusion, but we are together! Don't you get it? That's how I imagined it. That we are together! Whatever happens, we stick together. As I was trying to tell you before, the reality resides right there in your dialogues, but the story itself doesn't have to be realistic at all. Or not in all aspects. Your life is like a musical, anyway. Pretty much. Your mother would never have accepted him. She would not have let you in with him. That's true. That's true. Now she is dead, so... Now my house is open for you. That's true. I'll let you in. Well... ...I still would like to change you! Impossible. I was born like this. No, you were not born like that. Why? So, why am I gay? I think you are afraid of woman. Me? - You think I'm afraid of women? - Yes. Father... So, why didn't you tell us earlier, when you were with that old lady? - Were you like that then? - Yes. - So, why didn't you tell us? - Why would I? Because... No, no, because I was not ready to come out. You should have told me. And told your mother. No way! What did she do when I told her? Don't blame your mother, if something like this happens to a child, a mother behaves differently than a father. You could have told me, and we could have tried to solve it somehow. But how? Well, you were not so deep into things... If a girl loved you, you would be with her? How could I if I'm not attracted to her sexually. How? I really don't understand you. How is he better than a girl? How? Because he is a boy. Hello! - Where are you? - We are down here. - Is my mom there, too? - No. - Oh, my god! - They went to the cemetery. - Okay. Thanks. - Bye! Hold her picture in your hands. Don't be afraid! - Are you afraid of your mother? - No. But he is afraid. He told me that he was afraid. - Should I touch it like this? - Hold it in your hands. Just behave yourself! Kiss her. How much she cursed me! Look at what comes to his mind? Last time I saw her... ...she asked me: Are you sucking dicks? ...keep quiet! You faggot... Look at this, her effect on him... You, faggot, still sucking dicks? I think you should put the picture back. And she always did like this... - Give it to me. - Well, Gergo... I won't give her picture back to him. That's the truth. I am Orsolya Karafiáth, writer, poet, publicist, and performer. I find it extremely important both as an individual and as a public figure to stand up for human dignity, for mutual respect and for gender equality. László Kövér, who said homosexuals are like pedophiles, and also claimed that a normal gay person knows precisely that he is not equal to the majority. Despite our protests and the explanations, Mr. Kövér still holds this position, and that shows how our government thinks about acceptance. And we all know, that what those in power stand for, is what the masses will believe. Let me express my thanks to those who are here, and those who will come afterwards to voice their protest. Mom. Come and visit us next weekend. - That could be good. - Or during the week... I still don't have a job, so I'm home, you can come here any day. You also have to convince Gergo to go compete on the talent show. I told him that I'll break the window and he will lose me if not... Hello. Hi, go and compete in The "X" factor show. It's not The "X" factor, but "Star in Star". "Star in Star". Why won't you go? - Well, we have other... - Do you have the talent? We're working on something else now. We have to finish our script. Tell him that it's a very good opportunity for him. It's a good opportunity... The whole country will get to know him, and he can showcase his talent. Being in a talent show is only interesting for three days... People forget very fast. So, what? It's still a good opportunity! A script, a film, that is eternal. It stays on the big screen. That's how the film will start: Based on the story of Gergo Gagyi and Lenard Varadi the script was written by Gergo Gagyi. Music and lyrics by Gergo Gagyi. Show the world that you're a natural. You left out some parts. Like you don't say: off. I don't need to, it's not important. The rhythm works well like this. It's good like that. Give me a kiss, my love. Stop harassing me. Everything will be fine. Come here my sweetie, my love. Don't worry my sweetie. I won't mess up. But I do worry. - Hi. - Hi. You go up to the stage, there will be a red sign, you have to stop there. When you're done, you leave the stage on the left side. - Good luck, go ahead. - Thank you. That's it, my love. Still, we should not give up our dream, because I failed here. Well, yes. That's it. Gypsy crime! Gypsy crime! So many people think like that! The solution is much stricter laws. Normal law-abiding citizens should be allowed to bear arms... So, he can shoot Gypsies! I would support a segregation policy like the South African Apartheid. Gypsy crime is an existing phenomenon. It is there within the Gypsy society, primarily in Gypsy settlements. Jackson! Come in! You can go. - Hi, everybody. - Hi, everybody. - Can I enter? - Of course. This is where we lived. Who took the cabinets? - I don't know. - It was Sabina probably... She could have left it for you... Our cabinets were here... We had a table here. Our bed was over here. You see... We had a little table with a TV on it, a little carpet in front. Is this the fridge we left here? No. It was taken. It was stolen too. - Who stole it? - Are you serious? One day when we were out, everything was stolen from here. Our life was much more complicated when we lived here. Here is my dad, Lajos Gagyi. Hi Daddy. Let me tell you about Zsofi: She is a slammer. - Tell me in Hungarian please. - A slammer is a poet, a writer. She is studying script writing. I’m very hungry. To tell you the truth. You are doing really well, having a picnic party here. It is for you, because you said you were coming. I feel honored! Thank you so much! - You came home from a faraway land. - From a far-far away land... From far, far away. Can I get some for you, Lenard? - Don't you want to sit down? - No thanks. Thanks. It's nice and cool here. It's really nice out here. This is the most peaceful place in Salgotarjan. Very nice, indeed. I used to have sex with Lenard here. A lot. Tell us more about it. Stay where you are... If mom would be alive she would move like this... Gergo, you should tell your brothers how your film will start. - What kind of film is this? - You are in it too. - Who would play me? - Not you, that's for sure. So, who then? I can cry, I can laugh... - Whatever you want... - Tell them, so they understand! The film will start like this. Gergo is dreaming about having a Gypsy funk band. As he is singing, suddenly his brother appears on the stage. Gergo doesn’t understand what his brother is doing there in worker's clothes. While Gergo is dancing on the stage, Lajos goes up to him and slaps him. This wakes Gergo up, and he finds himself with his brothers in a forest, cutting wood. This is how the film starts. A fictional story with a pinch of the truth. So, people can understand our family’s style. Here comes the dialogue. They start to fight... "Why did you hit me? Why?" "Because you are an idiot..." "Who do you think you are? Where do you think you are?" Things like that... Good ending! At least you will gather some firewood for the winter. Happiness, I'm waiting for you. Happiness, I'm calling you. Happiness, where are you? I'm looking for you and I know I'll find you. What are you watching? Almost 10,000 people have already watched your clip. Nine thousand and something... 9,305 views. I think it's good! People watched and listened... Last time it was only eight thousand something... It's growing... Believe me, if we check it in a week, it will grow again. There could be more views Gergo... Tears fall from my eyes, and days are passing by, while I'm marching forward, and I'm looking for my life. Happiness, where are you? I'm looking for you, and I know I'll find you. Happiness, I'm waiting for you, Happiness, I'm calling you. Happiness, where are you? I'm looking for you, and I know I'll find you. Happiness. Happiness. Happiness. I'll find you! Don't you see that I am fighting for you? Because you don't fight for your own dreams! What do you do? You fight... - Do you fight for fame? - I make things happen. I've tried to contact recording studios, sent out several emails. I can't do anything if all you have is just one song. It's not good if we can't keep moving forward. Why don't...? When I get home tired, and you are silent, you don't bother me, that would be the best. And then? You will have it! I will make you a star. This is your goal. That's what you want. Do you promise that from tomorrow, you'll be quiet? - I do. - Let's see. If the outcome is good... then I do promise. HUNGARY - THE SOURCE OF MIRACLES Mom, I'm leaving... Come back here, don't be afraid... There is the bell. Ring it! Hi babies, this is Redblek. Today's guests are Lenard Varadi and his mother. How did you feel when you learned that your son had a non-traditional gender interest? How did it happen? Did you talk about it to your mom? Did you come out? Did she find it out? - How did it happen? - Will you tell him? I thought that he had a girlfriend. I was a little suspicious, because, well, a mother senses these things. There isn't usually such a close friendship between two men. When he confessed to me, I was shocked at first, but then I was also relieved, because it meant that he trusts me enough to share it with me, and I didn't learn about it from others. How did you come up with the idea for a musical? Where is the project now? - Imagine a bar of chocolate... - Yes... and... And only two of the slices are ready... It's still in process... Gergo is working all day long with a concrete breaker in his hands. It's not easy... when he gets home, he is too tired to write. We still have to write. We have to... Can you tell me your mission in one sentence? What is most important to you in life? Love. - That's fair. - That's the most important thing. Do you know who taught me this? My mom! She is such a good person. She is kind even to those who are mean to her. - Is your mom your role model? - Yes, she is, she wouldn't hurt anyone. Should I do this every day? - No way! - Yes! - But why? - Because you are home all day and do nothing. You don’t even love me. Are you listening? Do you love me or not? Decide! - Do you want me to be happy? - I do! Then don't say that I don't cook. And things like that. Yes, you cook. Gergo, I’m going to break down. You make me feel so ashamed. Are you serious? Are you coming out? Or what? Hey! Leave me alone, or I'll hit you! - Everyone will think that I’m evil. - You are not evil, my dear Leni. But you are saying that I am! What did I say? I was just kidding. - But baby! - Leave me alone! I will get angry and break everything again! Break everything baby! How can you treat me like this? In front of everybody! You are everything to me. My baby, I love you so much! Please come! I can’t eat without you! Your food is so delicious! The meat is amazing! And the potatoes too! Everything is delicious, my dear. As you know the photo shoot will be on Sunday. Yes. Is there any kind of style you always wanted to try out? Is there anything like that? I very much want to look like a mafia member! Will the others dress up so extremely? I want to show that homosexuality is not only about femininity, but about real men too. Okay. And Lenard? As we are talking about masculinity and femininity, if you were measured on a scale, where would you put yourself? Well, he is very gentle, he is more of a fancy man... You know what I mean, a delicate suit with a pink shirt, Pink goes very well with his face, with a V-neck, you know, just cool, his eyes are very powerful. - Can I get a mirror? - I'll give you one in a moment. She'll give you one in a second. How beautiful you are my love! Oh, my love... - We prepared a... - A portfolio? We collected some pictures. If you look at them, the first impression is the feeling of freedom. They radiate positive energy, everyone is pretty and fashionable in the pictures. This is the feeling we want to convey. Especially for those who are not as open as you two. Who are not as visible as you are. Is he gypsy too? - Yes, he is. - He doesn't look like one. No, he doesn't look like... Everybody. All the participants in this project are Romani and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The photographer makes really good pictures. Congratulations! Thank you very much for the invitation. It's very kind of you. It's so good... This is his dream... It will come true now. That's very good. You lean on him. You look very cool. One, two, three... One, two, three, throw it! That's good. Beautiful! Go, go, go, it's very good. Look at each other! It's outrageous! This is the party zone... You can tell them, I don't care... A bomb should be dropped on them! Look at it Gergo! This picture already has 1,101 likes on Instagram. ...and so many comments... You became a star! An influencer. We are kissing each other... Maybe I should not have posted this one... - Why not? - Well... This one has a lot of comments too. Please, if you can help it, don't shit in front of the store! - Are you working? - Can't you see me? - Can't you... - You are so pretty my love! Oh, Gergo... It's a local resident. - What did you eat today my love? - What? What you cooked yesterday. I brought it with me. We, all civil organizations will be there and we'll work together against this evil law! Despite the hetero propaganda, I became gay and not a pedophile! We'll do our best to protect everybody who is harassed by the hateful rules created by the government. Let us hear the voice of those parents whose children's lives are a living hell every day at school only because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or queer. WE ARE ALL HUMANS! Hi, my dear father! A law has been passed in Hungary that confuses pedophilia with homosexuality. Human relationships can't be influenced by law anyway. It will happen no matter what. People's basic idea about relationships are a man and woman. With a child, it's a family. Everybody imagines it like that. A parent doesn't imagine his son being with another man. - No. - No. I suffered a lot until I got here. Not all parents can accept the fact that their son or daughter is different. Same sex partner... It was not easy for me to accept it either. Love conquers everything! Look at their example! Let's applaud them! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! He breathed into his nostrils the breath of his life, man became a living soul. Indeed. ...and thus man became a living soul. I had the idea to find a shorthand typist... and... and... I would close my eyes, you know what I mean... and he would start writing: I changed so much. Didn't I? We have been together for 6 years now. We've gotten used to one other. We will grow old together.
