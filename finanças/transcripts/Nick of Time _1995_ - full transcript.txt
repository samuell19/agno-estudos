You know that, don't you? All right. Tell me something. You never once saw your mom and me kiss like that? No way. Not once? How did you see us kiss? That's it? That... That little peck of a kiss? Honey, you missed a whole lot of kissing. Come here. God, honey. Daddy's late. We got to go. - Look at him. He'd do anything for her. - Young love. Fuck me. Foreigners.

You ready, sweets? - Yeah! - Lets do it. This is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads, because you never know when you're gonna fall down and go boom. - —Right? - Rig ht. Come on, lets get out of here. Somebody... Watch your step. Come on. Perfect. Perfect. Could I see some identification, sir? - Excuse me? - ID. Can we see some? Sure. Sure. - Is a driver's license all right? - It'll be fine. What's the problem? It's about those guys. - —They were circling my little girl... - You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson? -Yes, I am -where's that? It's north near lompoc. Why? Come with us, sir. - I'd like to know what's going on first. - Don't cause a ruckus, sir. - Not with the little girl. - Ma'am! Listen, ma'am! I'll take my daughter. Don't worry. My partner's good with kids. You stole that. No, I didn't. I confiscated it. - There's a difference. - No, there's not. I'd like to know what's going on, officer. I'll explain. Officer, what's going on? Get in the front seat. Into the Van, Mr. Watson. Thank you. God. Let's get your seat belt on. Always want to wear your seat belt, right? I want my daddy! - —Daddy's right there. - Daddy's right here, honey. Daddy's here. We're daddy's friends. —that's right. The policeman's your friend, isn't that right, daddy? Daddy? That's right, honey. The police are our friends. Listen, officer, I have an appointment. I'd really like to know what's going on. This is the Jack. - Say, "hi, Jack." - Hi, Jack! This goes in this hole., right there. -Let me do it. —okay. Go ahead. Ifsloud! Let's get down to business. - Who are you people? - Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention. And your daughter won't be hurt. All right, honey, come to daddy. Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand? Do you understand that? - Yes. - Good. This is for you. In it, there's a picture and an itinerary. It's her itinerary. She is presently... - You listening, Mr. Watson? - Yes. She is presently at the bonaventure hotel. It's not far from here. When you leave this Van, you get yourself a taxi over there, and you will take it to the bonaventure hotel. Then... You'll take this, and you'll kill whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind you, kill her. I recommend you empty the gun into her, close up. You got all that? You're out of your mind. What's your point? I will do no such thing. Yes, you will, Mr. Watson. Don't worry. We'll take good care of the kid. It's now 12:16. If the woman in the picture's alive at 1:30, half past one, I call my partner. Your daughter's dead. What happens if I don't call you? I kill her anyway. You hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you understand? It's the woman in the picture or your daughter. My god. God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her. Only you. You're wasting time. Let's go. Honey“. Daddy has to go somewhere. I'll be back soon, okay? Stay with the nice lady. Move it. Let's test this thing. You on? Read you. You'll need some cash. - —Car's right over there. - Here you go. I'll hang on to the wallet for the time being. You'll need these. The cabs are that way. Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's wasting. Just do it. Where's my daddy going? Your daddy's going to help the police. He'll be a hero. Like power rangers? Yeah, just like power rangers. Mama! I'll check you in about an hour. Officer... You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long, and your daughter's dead. Get over there. Just do it. Go ahead, sugar pie. Lynn calling daddy! Lynn calling daddy! Come in, daddy. - Lynn. - I can hear you good. Can you hear me? I can hear you, honey. Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay, that's enough. Daddy has to go now. You have to say, "over and out, " daddy. You have to say, "over and out." Over and out. Okay, look at your watch. Look at it. At 1:30, your little girl is dead. Say it with me. "At 1:30, my little girl is dead," say it! Say it! Name it! At 1:30, my little girl is dead. Unless you do what you're told. You go do it. Don't forget! I'll be watching you! Excuse me. I need to get to the bonaventure. - Bonaventure? - Yeah. You know where that is? Yeah. You can see it from here. Amtrak? You come in on amtrak? Yeah. Business or pleasure? Business. Where did you come in from? What? Where you come in from? San Diego. San Diego. San Diego. I thought about moving out to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops, you can't make a dime. Lax passengers, they won't... These little hops... What do you think? About what? San Diego. Better opportunity in San Diego? I wouldn't know. I don't live there. I went there for a funeral. Somebody close? - Excuse me? - —was it somebody close to you? Yeah. Yes. It was my wife... Ex-wife. Soon to be ex. She wanted a divorce. Listen. I've got a problem. I've got a big problem. Jesus Christ! Maniac! What the hell are you doing? Sorry about that. I'd like to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. That will be $3.50. I hope your problem isn't about my $3.50. No, no. What, are you writing a check? - Thank you very much. - All right. Thank you. I got you, sir! Right here. - Want one for the airport? - —you betcha. Public accountant? What would I need with an accountant? Hello. Ben! Ben! Coming on down! Coming in! Let it go! Oh shit. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the emerald bay room is? It's the third floor, yellow stairwell. Follow the signs. - Thank you. - No problem. I have an enormous admiration for people like... - I'm sorry. - Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Are you sure? Nice body check. Anyway, it's illuminating, it's inspiring... Excuse me, ma'am. - Is the thing over? - You didn't miss anything. Food. Soggy pancakes. - —I guess the governor's gone. - Nice speech. It's the same... Okay, just check that itinerary and move along. It's right here. But that says invitation only. —see, you're a big donor to the campaign. Of course you're invited, they love you. That'll get you in anywhere. Who are you? I'm the guy who'll kill your daughter if you don't get moving. Nobody heard a word I said. The mic was too low on the podium. How much did we pay for that room? - We didn't. - We didn't? Well, somebody did. Make sure you have Melanie... Excuse me, sir. This elevator's for the governor. - You can take the next one. - No. Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest contributors. Look at the name tag. Come on in. It's okay. Hi. Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. Isn't it a mouthful? I love saying it. Who's idea was it to scheduled lunch right after brunch? We'll do some grip-and-grin and get ready for the press. - Governor? - Yes. I need your help. What can I do for you, Mr. Watson? - It's about my daughter. - Yes? Got room in there for one more? Well, I think we can accommodate one more. Pleasure, governor. Thank you very much. You were saying? Your daughter? Yes? She just wanted me to be sure that I got your autograph. Of course. I wish everything were that easy. I've got the pen if you've got the paper. How about that? Is that something precious? No, it's... Her name? Her name? Lynn. Her name is Lynn. You know, it's funny. I don't keep a pad of paper with me anymore. Everything's gone so electronic. Are you all right? I know. Elevators make me queasy, too. Here. Good luck. All right, here we go, guys. Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you! Thank you! She was right in front of you! What is wrong with you? Are you fucking with me? Are you fucking with me? Get up there. The gun isn't loaded. It's not? Give me the gun! You don't get chances like that... Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Turn around! Now, look at that. You see that? Do not blow the next one. Hear me? All right. It's loaded. It's ready for the hunt. So are we. Sorry I hit you. Just breathe deep. Let's go. - I need a rest room. - It's that way. You having a rough day? Down at the heels, as they say? You don't see your face, you don't pay. What you need is a shoeshine. Shoeshine today. That's pretty good. I've done much better ones than this. - —You have? - Yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home. That's good. That's good, sweetie pie. Let's go. Shoeshine. Shoeshine today. Shoeshine. Take 10. Take a break. Take a seat. Take a load off. What you need is a shoeshine. Come on. Take 10. Take a break. Take a load off. Put the world in perspective. So are you a visitor? No, I'm just visiting. What do you do, if I may be so bold? I'm sorry. What? What do you do? I'm an accountant. Don't denigrate yourself, my friends. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they could squeeze us until we popped. Isn't that right? Now, you take tips. Time was, a tip was between a man and his customer. Not anymore. They figured out what they call a formula. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck, they'll hit on the mean amount. "Mean" meaning in the middle, but it's just plain mean. You can have uncle scrooge ring a nickel over your palm or daddy warbucks dropping Pearl stickpins, don't make no difference. They'll tax your behind according to that same formula. - Doesn't seem right, does it? - No, it doesn't. Mr. Huey. How's it going today? It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it. Sir. Sir, I need your help. What was that? You have to speak up. There's a little girl, in a Van. She's my daughter. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm all messed up, compliments of the United States army - artillery corp. - Listen to me. A man and a woman were at the train. They showed me a badge, and then they took her away from me. Because they want me to do something for them. Do you understand? She's in trouble. I'll have you out in a few shakes. Please, I don't have much time. I need your help. - He's watching me. - —who's watching you? The man. You know, for a quality shoe, you can't beat a good wingtip. No, sir. It wears like iron. You know, you a wise man. There you go. Two bucks will do. - —You got anything smaller? - Keep it. - This is a 20. - That's fine. Keep it. - What street is that? - That's flower. Go past the bar. It takes you right out there. Do me a favor... If anything were to happen to me, remember the Van. She's in the Van. Ten minutes, you get another chance. Good. Then I have time to get a drink. Make it just one, Mr. Watson. Wouldn't want to lose you. So, where was I? Something about the governor's new regime. Yeah. She is dumping the good old boys faster than yesterday's newspapers. No wonder they're howling. They had no idea she would turn into this flaming' liberal. They're pissed. She's turned the governor's office into United Nations. You don't think they're gonna make her pay. Come on. Fuck with this bunch, they'll blow your ass to kingdom come. The only people not on her staff are those still lost in the rainforest. I'm serious! Who are these people? They don't represent you and me. Don't wake the baby up. What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. Now the thing you've got to ask yourself is, what's behind the seat? A .22 would go right through it, but even a button will throw a .22 off, so there's a chance it could get screwed up somewhere along the way and miss the target. What about a .38? A .38 will drill pretty straight unless, of course, it hits metal. Then it's going to bust up into little pieces, it'll keep going. But it's going to slow down. How's about a .357? That'll go through the seat, her, the dashboard. Shit! It'll go through the entire engine before it even knows it hit anything. It'll end up in some pedestrian, three blocks away. What do you think? What is my poison? Well, it's a comfort to know you got the cojones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger, we've still got to see. Close the door. It's hot outside. He's coming back in. I got him in the cross hairs. Excuse me. Pool deck. Where's the pool deck? Fourth floor. That escalator. Thanks very much. Take positions near the stage over here. Good view of the show. The rest of you keep your eyes open. Have a safe Clay. -Okay -got it. Sir, do you have metal in there? - Just my keys. - May I see them? Right here. Thank you. Tom, is that you? Sir, I can take you here. You don't have to wait. I can take you up here. Come on. Sir? Yes, you. I can take you down here. Come on down. Come on. Okay, you're all done. You can move on. Right here. Yes, sir, they're all in place. Check that entryway over here. Yes, sir. Officer? I know what you're thinking. You're like a worm on a hook, wiggling around, thinking you might get off. - What would you do? - She'd be dead. Do what you're supposed to do, young man. Do it now! What are you doing? - Officer? - Yeah. There's a plot to kill the governor. If you don't believe me, you can check that man. He has a gun. So do you, Mr. Watson. - You got this under control? - Yeah. - Sure doesn't look like it. - Well... It's under control. Yeah. Well, it better be, because I'm running out of these. I ought to throw you after that walkie-talkie, but I'm gonna give you a break 'cause you're amateur. - Gentlemen? - Yeah. Thanks. No, thank you. Have a cracker, Mr. Watson. Thank you. You got spunk. There was this guy... Big guy, Irish-Italian, red face, black hair, jolly son of a bitch. Wait a second. Nobody could make me laugh like him. He made a science of collecting jokes. Closed more bars together than I could count. Now, he was a pal. I loved the crazy Mick. I'm not ashamed to say that, but... He was a fuck-up. He had this image of himself. He thought he was a con man. Always trying to shave the edge. He was nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why. - Tell you why what? - —tell me why I miss him. -He's dead? —that's right. He is dead, but tell me why. - How do I know? - Tell me why he's dead. - Because you killed him. - —that's right. I did. I killed him. He fucked up too many times, so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him, just to make sure. Now, that was somebody I loved. I loved him. But I got the call. I put him down like a sick animal. So if you got doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver, let me tell you something. I'll make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat. You do what you're supposed to do, young man. You do it now. Let me have your attention. May I have your attention? Let's give a big welcome to the honorable Tom Bradley. Thank you. Are you feeling better? The elevator. You weren't feeling well. Are you better now? - Yeah. Yeah. Much better, thanks. - Better? I give you now my friend and yours, governor Eleanor Grant. You know something? My wife always said that I had a problem trusting people. Thank you, Tom, for that lovely introduction. You can trust Eleanor Samara Grant. Yeah. I'm gonna trust you. And you're gonna trust me. I don't understand. I don't wanna hurt you. But my little girl needs your help. She's going to die if you don't help. Okay, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. He's our head of security. No. Everything's fine. Take a walk with me. Just you and me. Step right this way. As it is, this is not the life I want for our children, for myself, and for you. I'm going to put the gun back in my pocket now. Don't move, because it's still pointing at you, all right? Just pretend that nothing's happening. My daughter's been kidnapped. They said they're going to kill her if I don't kill the governor. I don't want to do that, but... All right. Let's talk to security. No. We can't talk to security. They're involved. I don't see how they could be involved. They're the best. Hand—picked. Well, how did I get in here with this? - —I don't know. - Listen to me. If you don't help me, the governor will be dead. I promise you. Please. You got to trust me. It's hard to trust you under the circumstances. All right, then. Here. Do you trust me now? I guess I'll have to. Good. Respected and loved. Okay. There's one person that we can go to. Come on. I can't go anywhere. The guy that's following me has eyes in the back of his head. If he sees I'm not here, my daughter's dead. He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute. Wait. I am pleased to see today... We got about 10 minutes. - Ten minutes? You sure? - —yeah. I'm sure. I've heard this speech a lot. We'll take care of it wait. I can't. Trust me. You asked me for my help. Let me help. Come on. Listen. Put that thing away, would you? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And prove the communities do belong to the people. If we are to disrupt the cycle of violence, we have to win the war where it begins. With our children. We have to stand up, be counted, and change a perverted system that lets us carry guns to school but forbids us to pray there. Education. Education is the key. Education and service is where the power is. - —Ms. Brooks. - Is he in? Yes, ma'am. You sure we can trust these people? Yeah. It's her husband, her campaign manager. - What? Is there a problem? - Brendan, we need to see you. Aren't you supposed to be downstairs? Covering the con—- - we got to hurry. - I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor. - —What are you talking about? - We need people we can trust. We only got a few minutes. That's absurd. How do you know? I know it because I'm supposed to kill her. You're supposed to kill my wife? - —That's right. - And you brought him to our suite? I had to, Brendan. Her security people may be involved. Is there a problem, Brendan? I think you could say that. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor. Not hired. They're blackmailing me. Who is this "they"? I really don't know, sir. We've got to hurry. They've kidnapped my little girl. Your wife's in serious danger. Just a minute. On the strength of this story, you bring this man to Mr. Grant's suite? Do you think that shows very good judgment? I may be just a friend of Brendan, -but certainly-— -he brought a gun onto the pool deck. - —What? - He was carrying a gun. Now, how did he get past her security? - With this gun. - I'd like to know that. Is it real? I mean, do we know anything about it? It looks real. I don't know anything about guns. - May I see it? - The gun is real. It certainly looks real. May we have your opinion? You're supposed to be the expert. Yeah. I'd say it's real. Are you out of your fucking mind? - —What are you doing? - Get her out of here. What's the matter with you? God! What have you done to me? You bastard! You fucked up! You want me to kill your kid? You want me to kill you? That's enough. I said that's enough! Don't let him get away! I killed you. You fucked up. No, please. Please, no! Help me, daddy! Help! You put him down! Right now! You nearly killed him, you idiot. Nearly doesn't count. This is a nightmare. This was supposed to be clean and simple, remember? A high—powered rifle, and it's over. But no. You got to get creative. Drag some jerk in off the street, stick a gun in his hand, and what? What were you thinking? —relax, will you? It's academic now. What were you thinking, lock her in a closet? Been seen all over the hotel, looking like some looney tunes. Got him on video. It'll work. Don't worry about it. Come on, you. Up. Let's go. Up. I want to show you something. I don't think we should go through with this. I'm afraid it's too late for that now. How do I explain a dead woman on my bathroom floor? She's Eleanor's assistant. She would have been shot by the same gun, the same man. Some anonymous loser who went over the edge. Okay. Look at her. That's what it looks like. She was alive a minute ago, and now she's dead because you wouldn't do what I told you to do. Here. Clean up. We've only got few minutes to pull this together. Look at that! Let's go. Every single promise made to us when we got that woman elected has been broken. I don't have to remind you who was supposed to keep her in line. I know. Hi, Howard. Let me use your phone for a second. I know how this thing's supposed to work. Do you, Mr. Watson? - I kill her, you kill me. - Keep your voice down. Even if you don't those security men will, how am I supposed to get away? That's not my problem. Come back. How do I know you're not gonna kill my kid once I'm gone? Come back. I told you, she'll be all right. You do your job. Fine. I'm supposed to trust you? What choice do you have? After you. Gene, look out there. -You see the Van? —yeah. - Come back. - Yeah? Do it. Daddy! Help me, daddy! No! Son of a bitch! Security force. Take the next car. Thank you. - Do it again. - Daddy, no! You got one last chance. Half an hour, the kid is dead. I'll kill her myself. I'll rip her head off in front of you. Get up. Come on! Daddy, did you hear me scream? She told me to scream ad loud as I could, did you hear me? Jesus. Next time I tell you to do something, do it! Fuck you! You want to baby-sit a screaming kid, you come out here and do it! He got the message, didn't he? Come on. Step up. Give them a shine, a little extra something. Step up. Do your shoes a favor. What you need is a shoeshine. Shoeshine. Shoeshine today. Take 10. Take a break. Take a seat. Take a load off. Put the world in perspective. So, what do you do, if I may be so... You got a complaint? - Remember me? - Yeah. Big tipper. Good. Listen. Something's going to happen. When it's over with, you'll know what I was talking about. What? The end of the world? Look, man, don't give me your crazy rap. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your white ass out of my chair. Big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change, you got it. Did you give me a 20? Let's get some privacy. He's deaf. - You wouldn't be kidding me. - —no. He can't hear a thing. Read that sign. Is that right? Shine man, you can't hear me? Hello. Well. Looky here. My customer quotient got multiplied by two! What do you think of that? You have to forgive me, sir. I didn't hear you approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deaf as a post. You want a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay. Yeah. Sure. Give me a shine. Let's get out our itinerary. Hold that. Don't throw it away. I'll put your toy back in your pocket, Mr. Watson. It's all wound up. Now let's check that itinerary. Right there. "1:30, California ballroom." That's right. That gives you 28 minutes to get your shit together. - Let me talk to her again. - No. - I wanna talk to her. - Forget it. You let me talk to her, or you can forget it. Don't you threaten me, young man. Be a lot less trouble if you'd just let me talk to her. You're wasting time. Come back. - Yeah? - Put her on. - What gives? - Just put her on. Daddy? - —Yeah, honey. It's me. - I'm tired. I want to go now. I know you do, honey. So do I. Can we go now? Not just yet, baby. Daddy has to do something first. To be a hero? No, not to be a hero, honey. I want you to remember something for me, okay? All right. Daddy's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, he's doing it for you because he loves you, all right? All right. - Promise me that? - I promise. All right. Kisses to you. No. Kisses to you. Kisses to you, sweet pea. You done yet? Two dollars, if it pleases you. It does not. I remember when it was two bits. Twenty-seven minutes. Thanks for the tip. Mister, what are you dragging me into? - I'm dragging you into... - Cover your mouth. - What? - This gorilla's watching you, right? Yeah. Don't let him be seeing you talking to me. All right. - That your kid on the walkie-talkie? - —yeah. They got her in a Van across the street. They said they'd kill her if I don't do something. In 27 minutes in the California ballroom? Yeah. That's right. What are you supposed to do? Kill the governor. I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that 20. What am I supposed to do about this situation? What am I supposed to do? These people have my baby. One wrong move, and she's dead. I don't know who to trust. Everybody's involved in this. I mean everybody. - Except for... - Who? The governor. Jesus Christ. I got to somehow do right by my little girl. I don't care what happens to me as long as she's okay. Look, I can't keep playing with these shoes. It will look funny. You go on down and get yourself a drink. Make sure Godzilla follows you. What are you going to do? I don't have the faintest idea. Just go. I'll get word to you. Stay out of it. Keep the change. Yeah, well, don't think I won't. I'm going to get a drink. Those Lily pads... Let me get a Jack and coke. Jack and coke. Thought she would get out the violins. If I hear that "stop the violence“ bit one more time I'm going to shoot somebody. Politicians, all the same. God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Say it with me, ”at 1:30, my little girl is dead." "Say it!" I 7! Make gravy out of your little girl. Kisses to you. I'll kill your daughter in a moment. Get moving, Mr. Watson. - God can't help her. - Sir? Sir? - Here's your Jack and coke. - Thank you. It's such bullshit. There is no such animal. You know what we are? We are a nation of 240 million special-interest groups, and that is it. Sir, you haven't paid for that. It's on that special interest at the end of the bar. Sir? Sir? Don't make me calla cop. Where is he? Did you lose him? Shut up. Let's hope so. Quick. Quick. Off with the shoes and pants. Trade with gustino. Hurry up. Come on. Just do like I tell you. Don't worry about it. No time to be shy, ladies. Come on. Do as I tell you. Hurry up. Godzilla's coming. Come on. Hurry up. Okay. All right. Come on. It's all right. He's gone. Ready! - This is Irene. - Hi. - Hello. - Irene's going to help. -Thank you. —follow me. Where am I going? You only knew one person that wasn't in this. - —You're going to see her. - What? You sure she's asleep? I took some extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech. - What will I say to her? - It will come to you. Stop this before it starts. Save us considerable embarrassment. You don't have to save me. I got nothing to do with it. - I won't give you no key. - Irene. No. I'm not gonna do it. - Come on, Irene! - I'm sorry. - Hi, Albert. - How are you? Pretty good. Thought I'd clean up a little for you. That's mine. Thank you. - You deserve a nice, clean place. - Thank you. So... Give me that. Yes. Thank you. How's everything? Working hard? - Working hard. - I know how it is. So... how long will you work here? About 5:00. - Really? See you later. - —take care. I don't want to hurt you. My security people are right outside. Any loud noise, they come right in. You wouldn't get very far. If I was gonna hurt you, I would've done it already. At least that's a little comfort. I have a problem. I can see that. Sorry to say, ma'am, but my problem is also your problem. Wait a minute. I know you. You're from the elevator. That's right. You were very nervous. Guns tend to make me very nervous. Yeah, me, too. We don't have much time. I need you to listen to me. Three lives depend on you listening, do you understand? Yes, I do. I want to hear you. Just let me call my assistant. - Her name is krista Brooks. She's... - She's dead. She's dead? How do you know that? I saw her die. - Did you kill her? - No. Who did? A very dangerous man. That works for your husband. Your husband works for someone else, and they want you killed. I said I'd listen. I didn't say I'd believe. You're trying to tell me my people are in a plot against me, that my husband is trying to kill me. What do you expect? I know. I know. I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But there is one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech. I wish you wouldn't refer to it as my last speech. It's the last chance I have to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule. You'll know I'm right. Governor, don't make that speech. Trust me. I love it when pistoleros talk about trust. I have never fired one of these before, but I will if I have to. Indeed. Nine minutes, governor. Albert! Let me go! What is it, governor? What's wrong? I had a really bad dream. I had a really bad dream. -Well? —I don't know. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I got to get back. Yeah, but what are you gonna do? I'm going to do whatever I have to. Man. We got to go. Phil, I got it. Come on, Murray. Come on. - —Where is he? - He's in the toilet. It's time. It's time now. You ought to learn to relax. I told you I got it under control. Where are we going? Not very far, honey pie, not very far at all. Out of there! Mr. Watson, time's up! Let's go! Out of there! - Now you've forgotten. - What? Wash your hands. Why are you doing this to me? I saw you with your kid. I knew you'd do anything for her. I got faith in you, Mr. Watson. You're not just a regular guy, see? I know that. You don't know it yourself. Maybe that's why. Come here. I chose you. I know what I have to do. I'll do it. Let's do it. I'm ready to head downstairs. Good afternoon, Eleanor. I've got a killer headache and siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech. It's... it's an important speech. I'd say critical. Of course it's no business of mine. Just another speech in a tower of babel so high even nimrod would be put to shame. Cancel and make my apologies. Why don't you excuse us? Yes. I'll trot along. Nice to see you, Eleanor. Honey, during a campaign, every speech is important. It's free prime—time news coverage we couldn't buy. What's he doing here? - Who? Him? - Yes, him. I asked him here. I needed his input on several issues. Things have changed, Brendan. I thought you understood that. Eleanor, don't start with that. I understand things have changed better than you do. I'm the one dealing with the repercussions. I'm the one taking the heat for the broken promises you've made to people like him, people who helped get you elected by the way! Don't remind me. Listen to me. This speech or a half-dozen rubber-chicken fund-raisers. What do you say? The truth? The truth is I've got this lower-intestinal havoc, Brandon. I feel sick. I want to... I want to cancel the speech. This isn't like you. You're a trouper. I'm going to get some pepto. You go downstairs and make one of your patented tributes to the common person, and we're back to Sacramento. We can't afford to lay down on the job now. I don't care what the polls say. You want to blow off the Sacramento speech, that's fine, but do this one. Let's get out of the smog. Okay. I'll do it. That's my girl. I want to make some last-minute changes in that speech. Would you send krista in right away, please? I sent her on an errand. You sent my assistant on an errand? Yeah. Why do you keep looking at me? It's my job. I'm your baby—sitter. I'm not a baby. You're a big girl? I'm not a big girl, but I'm not a baby. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the press, campaign volunteers, and those of you looking for any excuse to take off from work this afternoon. Let me be the first to welcome you to this afternoon's campaign banquet. We have... The first woman governor of the great state of California! Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. Well, what can I say about her that won't get me in trouble when I go home tonight? Seriously, she is a woman who loves our great state. I know you recognize her as a charitable and enlightened leader. She actually united Republicans and democrats in the assembly to pass new laws to improve the lives of all californians. Charlie. Yo, Charlie? Charlie, you reading me? Charlie! Charlie? Charlie, you reading me? Shit. Stupid radio. Terry. Terry. The walkie-talkies don't work from here. There's too much concrete and stuff. The greatest governor California has ever seen! I am honored to present to you our esteemed governor and my beloved wife, Eleanor Samara Grant. Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go, Ms. Grant! Go on! Get down, governor! Get a doctor! The governor's been shot! They did it. A bleeding heart makes a very big target, governor. My god. Franco? Fr... Oh, my god! Are you all right? I'd be better if they'd put sleeves on these damn bullet—proof vests. It's time. You read me? I don't hear you. I'm gonna go ahead now. Fuck with me? - Close your eyes. - Why? - I have something for you. - A surprise? You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not? Close your eyes. Afternoon, ma'am. Hello there, little girl. What are you doing? I'm giving you a clean windshield. I don't want my windshield cleaned. So just get out of here. You just think you don't need your windshield cleaned. I know that I don't want it cleaned. So get out of here! Come on. Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields, leading you through the desert of dead bugs. This is the last time I'm telling you I don't want my windshield cleaned, so get the hell out of here. I've already done it. You have to pay me now. I ain't paying you nothing. You would deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweat like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windshield? - Fucking a! - I don't think so! I think this is worth a dollar. Give it to me! Give it to me! You better do better than that. You ungrateful... Whip your ass. Give it to me! Get off me! Daddy blew it. Very good, Mr. Watson. I told them I could make a killer out of you. Daddy! You okay, honey? Yeah? Thank god. Nothing like a good wingtip. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay -I'm okay. —baby. I'm in the bonaventure lobby with this breaking news story. Just minutes ago, shots were fired at governor Grant. The police are beginning to arrive on the scene. The details of the attempted assassination continue to pour in. This will be one of the most bizarre stories this year. Our sources are pinpointing a conspiracy, which could point as high as Brendan Grant, governor Grant's husband. This is a bizarre case, and we will give over to you any details late breaking events, as we get them. Stephen schuster, jbn.
