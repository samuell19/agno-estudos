[wind blowing] [Willy] My grandfather told me, [engine roaring] you must be better. You must be, not good, not average... [engine roaring] You must be better than the best. He made it clear. It wasn't a matter of whether you want to succeed or not. You're going to. [cars zipping past] [indistinct announcement on PA] There was no black driver at that time. There was death threats. If this nigger races in this race, he not might not leave alive. They called me Uppity. Uppity nigger. And I loved it. My grandfather, he was the only black plumbing contractor in the city of San Jose. His business was pretty much all white, and he knew he had to be better than his competitors, and he drilled that in us. That was, to me, very important. He started in 1927. By 1960s he was doing so well that he bought a ranch and left the plumbing business to my dad and my uncle. Because of the family business, my dad had motorcycles, and he had go-karts, and he had sports cars. And that was my introduction. My dad was racing as a hobby. [Phillip] He competed in amateur racing. We were always exposed to racecars, and racing car drivers. He was maybe about five or six and he met Dan Gurney and oh, God, he just followed him all over the track. [man in promo] If a race driver is ever elected president of the United States, it probably will be Dan Gurney. Dan Gurney, he was such a nice person. He says "Okay, let's take our picture." Dan was smiling all over the place. He thought he was a real crack up. [Willy] The Dan Gurneys of the world. The Jim Clarks of the world. They were the reason I wanted to be a race driver. And I knew that at nine years old. [Geraldine] From then on, he spent his time with the automobiles rather than brothers and sisters. I had a Lotus Cortina, which is a little two-door sedan. Every opportunity he would have when he came home from school, first thing he did was go jump in the car. I knew where the key was... [engine spluttering] ...and I went up to a windy road, called Mount Hamilton Road. At 12 years old. The sheriff called me and said, "You know we got Willy T. out in your car." I said "Huh?" [sirens wailing] My mother didn't spank me, and my Dad didn't spank me. But they said you're going to the ranch. If you got in trouble, my grandfather, who was the person you worried about. It wasn't the law. He was only five foot four, but he was as big as Shaquille O' Neal. I said you need to stay out here for a while, where you can run a car without it running over somebody. My grandfather hated auto racing. It was not to be mentioned at the ranch. So you didn't talk about it around him. He thought that being involved in auto racing was spending money recklessly. You had to have a goal. And it better pass the smell test with him. He wanted to know what I was going to do. I told him, I wanted to be a formula one driver, or an Indy 500 driver. There was no black driver at that time. He said to me, you're a goddamn fool. [Geraldine] Told him, "No, you can't do that." Willy T. said, "Grandpa, but that's what I want to do." And he says, "Well, I don't care what you want to do. You can't drive a car." [Willy] "I built this business to hand over to you, so you wouldn't have to work for somebody else. So you could be your own boss." And with him, being your own boss meant everything. You had to be your own boss. I wanted to be my own boss. Behind the steering wheel. I wanted to be a race driver. Young drivers from all over the world would all go to Britain, and run the Formula 4 championship. [announcer] This is Formula 4, a late outgrowth to the Formula B division. [Marshall] Formula 4 is a place where if you have a desire to be a professional motor racing driver, that was where you went. That's the place where you find out if you're real. And if you're good enough, you come out and people pay attention. [Willy] I let my parents know, that I'm not going to go to college. Look at me going to England to race Formula 4, is like sending me to college. My dad knew the dangers of racing. He would never admit that he was worried about me getting hurt or killed. But he knew it was there. He lost quite a few friends right in front of his eyes. Killed right in front of his eyes. He was reluctant. Especially as a career. When you do it as a career, you're all in. You're all in. When I got to England, I knew from reading Autosport Magazine. There was a team that was very successful. It was called Scorpion Racing. And the owner was Mike Eastick. So I drove out to his farm and knocked on the door. He thought I was there to get a job on his farm. I said, "No, I'm here to talk to you about driving one of your racecars." If you brought money. Whether it was personal money or sponsored dollars, he'd put you in a racecar. I paid him with my college money. We shook hands on a deal. Two weeks later, he had me testing his racecar at Mallory Park. If you want to be an IndyCar driver or a Formula One driver, you start at that level. The older model racecar, which is what he put me in, costs 200 pounds per race. I finished third in my first race and right then, he said, "Okay, I want you to go to the newer model." [announcer] Coming to get the green flag... [Willy] The second race I won. When I called home from England, I said, "I won." And there was a pause. "You're kidding," and I said, "No, I won." I was racing against Nigel Mansell and Michael Rowe. And those guys were really tough. Mansell went on to be Formula One world champion. It was my fourth or fifth race. The head of Formula One was there, Bernie Ecclestone. [Marshall] Bernie Ecclestone took over Formula One. Turned it into the world's number two sport behind soccer. Made it a commercial success, billions upon billions. [announcer] And a beautiful start! [Marshall] You can't even quantify how big Bernie Ecclestone is in Formula One. If somebody was doing well in any of the lower series, they would probably come into GP3 or GP2 and then get recognized and go into Formula One. And that's why I was there. I wanted to catch your eye so I could be a Formula One driver or an Indy 500 driver. I won six out of eleven races. I had such a large points lead, I couldn't be beat. Willy was so dominant with the Scorpion Racing Team. He didn't even need to finish the season. He'd earned so many points, championship was already his. Once I won my championship in Formula 4, I was out of money. [Bernie] You do need some support financially, in order that you can get recognized. Because you can't just say, "I think what I'm going to do is be a Formula One driver," and pop into a car. [Marshall] Once you start coming out of Formula 4, getting into Formula Three, that's when things start getting a little bit expensive. Family support? That comes to an end after Formula 4. You really do need sponsors. [Chris] Wanting to be a racecar driver. It costs. It costs a lot of money. [Willy] A lot of the drivers were being sponsored by their own country. I didn't get that, and so... I could not go to Formula Three, and I had to come home. When I came back to the United States, I was 22 years old. The next step from Formula 4 to the United States was Formula Atlantic. And I got a phone call from the Long Beach Grand Prix Association. They had a sponsor that put me in my first race in the United States. I didn't have a car that I could win with, but the objective was to get my feet wet in the United States. Before every race, there's a drivers meeting. You could feel the tension. In England there was no animosity about the color of my skin. It was about, "Hey, let's go out and race." And when I walked into that drivers meeting in Long Beach. Not one driver spoke to me. Not one. They didn't even look at me. After that, there was nothing. Despite what I accomplished in England. He came back knowing that, "I just did something, accomplished something that very few Americans have. Let alone African-Americans." And no one would give him a shot, no one. I came to speedway back in 1975, and I was always looking for an angle. We would do crazy things like Robosaurus. He ate six cars. [roaring] Then we had high wire acts. When Geoff Bodine came down here from Chemung, New York, and I used to say, Earnhardt's Robert E. Lee and Geoff Bodine is Grant. For a while there, they sold a lot of tickets 'cause there was a civil war kind of aspect about it. I get a phone call from a promoter in Charlotte, North Carolina. [Humpy] If 30% of the population is Black, you want to get some of those people in it. [Willy] He said, "I could put you in a car." I did not know he was The Blonde Don King. Humpy Wheeler was smart enough to say, "This would be great for our series." "We're going to get some attention down here, and you're the guy that's going to bring it." I knew it would work If we got the right black race driver. And his record was pretty darn good considering the equipment he had to work with. I've had a lot of guys in cars out there just trying to see what they can do. Usually it takes them two days just to figure out how to get through the first turn. He didn't waste any time, he just got out there on the fourth lap, and he was running pretty steamy laps. I said, "You gonna crash this thing if you keep going." He said, "That's the only way to go fast, get it loose." [Marshall] So Humpy and Willy announced they are going to get Willy into the World 600, one of NASCARS biggest events. I didn't think about any of the political or social ramifications. That didn't, it didn't cross my mind. But he knew. You think about that time period we were in in the '70s. Everything was supposed to be integrated and yackity yack across the country, but it wasn't. There was still a lot of segregationists. [indistinct chatter] Next week, I'm going to put Jews under-- [speaks indistinctly] [Al] Willy had challenges in front of him that other race car drivers didn't. You're coming into a sport where the majority of the people are white, and they have been from its conception. You go to a racetrack and 75% of the infield was still waving rebel flags. They might call it the United States racing series. It's a Southern racing series. Daytona's down there, Talladega's down there. That is all white. Humpy said, "There's a few people that are not going to like you down here." I said, "Well, they're just gonna have to get used to not liking it." No, that's not a place to go. Not if you're black. That weekend there was a big race in Talladega. And when we got into the pits, people were actually spitting on the ground near me. [spitting] It wasn't a very warm welcome, and it really started to piss me off. If you're such a badass, don't spit, start swinging your fists. The clash of taking a west coast, Northern Californian, black man, dropping him into the deep south, and expecting him to know the Jim Crow playbook and that he's not expected to be proud to be his own man and thinking that's going to be a success? I don't know how anybody actually thought that was going to work. [Willy] And so I said, "Okay, you wanna have a reason not to like me? I'm gonna give you one." [Humpy] All the drivers were there. All the crew chiefs were there, some of the car owners, and some press guys. [sighs] A hand went up, an African-American hand. In Talladega, Alabama. And Willy said, "Can you pass in the grass?" [Willy] They had a real narrow pit lane and the drivers were coming out of the pits. They were nearly running into each other. You stood at the driver's meeting and said to the grand national competitors, "I have one question, can you pass in the grass?" Do you regret having said that? Oh, no, because it was probably one of the most intelligent questions ever asked in a Grand National Driver's meeting. Uh, Chief Stuart was a card carrying member and his face tightened up, with rage. Boy, that was a huge mistake. [Willy] There was death threats that were called in. If this nigger races in this race, he might not leave alive. It was not only that call, but we got a lot of other calls. "If you let that blankety blank run in the race, I am going to kill you" My grandfather believed in right and wrong. And you don't turn the other cheek when you're right. You do not walk away from that. [Humpy] Things just kept getting worse and worse and worse. So I sat Willy down. I said, "Willy, maybe next year or the year after, but this is not the time to do it." This place is too inflamed. He was definitely fighting an uphill battle. Especially being the personality that he was. [Humpy] That kind of ended as they say, "The Battle of Willy T." [Willy] Humpy had to pull the plug and I wish he hadn't. In England, in 1977, I met Muhammad Ali. From then on, he sorta took me under his wing. He said to me, "You're going to deal with some challenges... For one reason only. You're not in basketball. You're not in baseball. You're in an all-white sport." What gave me resolve was thinking about my grandfather and what he taught me, and then there was Muhammad Ali. And his three-and-a-half-year layoff. Where he couldn't make a living. It took his livelihood away. I thought about those, those two men... And I thought, all right. Don't give up mentally. You might not be in a racecar, but don't give up. Don't quit on yourself because the only person who's going to beat you is you. No one was jumping to put me in a racecar. I didn't want to be... working for my dad. I didn't wanna be in that business, but I had to. Everything I achieved in England was meaningless. I went from driving a racing car and winning races, to driving a service van for my dad. It was devastating. An acquaintance with my dad's company was doing a job for-- On a building that he owned. He asked me to go to a race with him. And I said, "Nah, I don't wanna go." And he says, "Well, they're having a Can-Am race at Laguna Seca in Monterey, and would you go?" I said, "No, I don't want to go." He says, "Come on, I'll drive down. I'll drive you down. Just walk me around, I've never been." Went down there and I was walking through the pits and I met Jim Trueman. I didn't know who Jim Trueman was, he said, "I own Red Roof Inns." [announcer] And Jim Trueman has moved up into fourth place right now. [Marshall] One of the great sportsmen. Jim Trueman's life was really all about IndyCar and Bobby Rahal. But given the chance Jim would absolutely spend some of his money to help give chances elsewhere. My version of success is to see how many other people I can help be successful. [Willy] He says, "What do you wanna do?" I say, "Well, I'm out of racing." He says, "Yeah, I know." He says, "Why?" I said, "No, no backing." "All right, I want you to call me next week. Call me Tuesday." I asked him, I said, "Are you serious?" He says, "Call me." "What kind of cars do you want to race?" And I said, "Well, I want to continue to do Formula Atlantic." You find the team and if you like it, tell me how much it's going to cost. [Ian] The Formula Atlantic Series, was in many ways the pre-eminent road racing series in North America, in 1982. It was the most similar to what a race driver would be driving anywhere else in the world at the same level. [Willy] My first Formula Atlantic race, I ran in the top Six. Then next year, I put it on the pole. And the guys that were in that race were Al Unser Jr. Michael Andretti, Jeff Brabham. Willy qualified three-tenths of a second faster than the entire field. That surprised me and everybody else. The only person who wasn't surprised was Willy. [Willy] In front of Formula One, in front of Bernie Ecclestone, in front of the elite of the sport. With no time. And we put that son of a bitch on the pole. I knew that. I said, "I'm as good as anybody in the sport." [Ian] Took off, and I had a good week. He led more than half of the race. But what took us out was the failure of the engine. [Willy] And I could feel the engine start to fade. If it wasn't for mechanical failure, I might've won the race. The reason that engine failed was because it had something like 1800 miles on it before we even started the race. Everybody we were beating, they had a brand new engine with a hundred miles on it. And it was special for Long Beach and much better power and torque than our engines. [Willy] But it didn't matter. I knew I was back. You all saw it. Now what do you have to say? What do you gotta say now? Where's the deals? Where's the phone calls? What are you scared of now? Nothing happened. No deal. So I worked in the family business. That was hard. The end of 1982. Two days before Thanksgiving, the phone rang, and it was Paul Newman. [Wally] Paul Newman took racing really seriously. [engine roars] He wanted to be respected as a driver. The only thing that I ever found any grace in was an automobile. [Willy] I first met Paul in the pits. It was brief, and he said, "Keep up the good work." I did not know that Newman was actually paying attention, until I got that phone call from him. "Hey, kid, I got a deal for you." I know you like Formula Atlantic but the Trans-Am Series is an opportunity for you to become a paid race driver. It's going to be a first class team. Think about it, and let me know. I said, "No, I've already thought about it. If you recommend it, I'm doing it." He says, "All right, you're going to get a call from Budweiser. They got a few hard asses there, so if there's any problems, call me." [Marshall] SCC Trans-Am wasn't as big as IndyCar, but it was definitely popular. [Willy] DeAtley Racing was sponsored by Budweiser. For Trans-Am at that time, it was state of the art. And when Paul Newman called me and recommended this Trans-Am which-- I didn't know anything about Trans-Am. I was blown away. But I knew he knew I could go fast. That, he knew. He said, "I'm not helping myself here 'cause I'm going to be racing against you and I know how fast you are." [announcer] They go into turn number one and Paul Newman from third starting position sneaks to the inside and passes Willy T. Ribbs, but Ribbs grabs the lead back. "But I'm driving a racing car for a different reason than you are, I enjoy it, it's my hobby. You drive a racing car to put a roof over your head. And that's why you need to be in that car." [Willy] It took five years for me to be in this position. To be a paid pro driver. This was an opportunity for me to not have to go back to where I was. I didn't want to go back to driving a plumbing van. The difference between a Formula Atlantic car versus a Trans-Am car, is night and day. To go fast in a Formula Atlantic car, you had to be smooth. The Trans-Am car , the engines in the front. It's a big high horse power car with big tires on it. Trans-Am cars of that era were absolute hand-made monsters. Eight hundred horse power engines. These cars, very quickly, told you whether you had the skill to get the most out of them. Being on the ranch sliding those trucks and vehicles and all that. I mean, I learned car control at an early age. And that's what you needed with that Trans-Am car. [Pat] Willy ended up being way faster than I expected but I was certainly hoping for. [Willy] Then I had a good teammate by the name of David Hobbs David Hobbs is a very accomplished driver. Won a lot of races. [Marshall] IndyCars, Indy 500, Le Mans, just everything. World renowned race car driver. [Hobbs] First race was at Melrose Park in Florida when I met Willy and Willy became the second car. I knew he was a very nice personal young guy. And practice showed he was pretty quick too. I was the designated number two driver. [Marshall] David Hobbs was the number one driver, period. There was no argument. There was no question. There is a hierarchy of how things are done. The number one driver is going to get the number one equipment. [Willy] You get the best engines. You get all the best components. In auto racing, the title teammates really doesn't apply. Because you're trying to beat your teammate more than you're trying to beat the other teams. Just to establish who's going to be top dog on the team. [Pat] There was a motor improvement that David got. A next generation intake manifold. to perk his car up a little bit. A real super motor, right? Now going to David's car. You know and then, the one that's really good, but not that good would go in Willy's car. [Willy] If you were to put it on a clock, the number two driver is going to be a half a second slower than the number one driver. And it was designed that way. He didn't have the car David had. Whether there was an order or not. The deck is stacked against you. You have to be very determined. My mindset was like my grandpa taught me. That I had to be better. And I wasn't gonna let David Hobbs get in the way of that. He was the number one driver until we got to the first race. When qualifying was over, I was on the front row. He was behind me. And that didn't go over well. His fish and chips weren't tasting too good. Dave and Willy were neck and neck. I mean they didn't have any fear. They were gonna be going for the lead pretty much no matter what it took. [Willy] I lead the race until I had a flat tire. The second race was Summit Point, West Virginia. Hobbs, he had that look on his face like, I'm coming for you. That's when my crew chief said to me, "I had heard you were fast, but we had no idea you were that fast." I said, "You ain't seen nothing yet, wait till I've learned this thing. I don't even know the car yet." [Willy] The fourth race was in Portland, Oregon. Willy and David went to the front. And Willy took his first lead in a Trans-Am race. [indistinct announcement] [Willy] I was starting to learn how to control tire wear and I just drove a smart race. [indistinct announcement] [Willy] It was just a good hard race you know. If he would have won, I wouldn't have felt bad, and I hope he doesn't feel bad with me up front. It had been so long to get to victory circle. Going from a Formula Atlantic car to a Trans-Am car, this is one of those things that might take someone a couple of years to figure out the nuances. How Willy adapted to this so soon, I genuinely don't know. [Willy] It was my first professional win. And it was awesome. It felt good. It was no looking back after that. I was making no bones about "I'm here to win." And I'm not number two. [Marshall] His rookie year became a thing known for winning. He made that statement right away. Guy in a racecar, tough ass series, bad ass competition. Kicking the shit out of them, more often than not. Willy was unbeatable in a Trans-Am car. He just flew. [Pat] He was definitely the number one driver. And I'm not sure that the team realized how fast Willy could be. [Hobbs] As the year progressed, it was apparent that Willy was a very, very fast driver. But he certainly didn't make friends very easily and he was very abrasive. Between me and my buddy David Hobbs, it was personal. David knew that. [Robby] Willy was a polarizing driver and he tended to torque some of the more delicate drivers. Some guys didn't like it. He had a hard time dealing with them. Even if you are good, you know, Jimmy Clark was the best. But he didn't make this known at every breath he took. Now I am one of the best drivers in auto racing, period. Black, white, oriental, or Hispanic. Ray Charles can see that. [Marshall] There are folks who either love that kind of personality, and there are those who don't. Uh, A.J. Foyt, four-time Indy 500 winner... Punch you in the mouth as quick as he'd say hello to you. I don't hear folks saying they hate him. [Willy] It wasn't about racing. It was about you're not toeing to subservient line. That was the attitude that team manager John Dick gave me. You're lucky to be here. John Dick was Hobbs' boy. It seemed as if John might not have cared for Willy's showmanship ways and I think the fact that he was as fast as David might've increased the friction. [Willy] He wanted Hobbs to be the absolute number one. Well, that wasn't happening. So, halfway through the '83 season, the team manager and I, we didn't talk at all. So this is just literally a case of, "you don't belong here." I was called into the office and asked if I thought Willy should be let go. Second to the last race, was Riverside, California. Hobbs, if he won the race, could clinch the championship. Before the race started, the owner asked me to finish second to Hobbs. And I said no. He says, "I would like you to finish second to David Hobbs. You're under orders." And I said, "All right, I'll do it. But you pay me first place money." He said, "No, I'm not going to do that." I said, "Well, then no, I'm not going to finish second. You guarantee me first place money, and then I'll take a powder." Right before I got ready to put in gear to move off, he said, "Okay." Hobbs won the race, clenched the championship. The next race was Las Vegas, and I left him. [announcer] Ribbs coming out of turn number one. Grabs the lead... [Willy] It was cake. [announcer] Memorize that number and color 28, red and white, Willy T. Ribbs. But the checkered flag comes out and it is Willy T. Ribbs winning the Caesars Palace Grand Prix for Trans-Am cars. I won rookie of the year. In the end I won the championship. And he was not very happy. And made it pretty known. [Willy] When I left Las Vegas, I knew who the man was in Trans-Am. I was looking forward to 1984. I had championship on my mind. We were not going to be with the Camaros, we were transitioning to the Corvette. It was a whole different chassis, and suspension geometry and I was looking forward to it. I came back as David Hobbs' teammate, but not number two. And I made that clear. Road Atlanta was the first race of the year, and I knew there was a new driver that was coming into the series named Bob Lobenberg. And I knew that he was a bit of a pop off. Sunday morning warm-up. Went out on the track. We had an issue. We were going down into the dip, about 190 miles per hour. He's right next to me, and he forced me off the road. When someone runs someone else off the road, it's kinda like pointing a gun at him and pulling the trigger. I ran down to his car. And I yelled at him and I hit him in the helmet. If a driver was out there driving and somebody cut them off, at the end of the race they fought it out. [announcer] And there's a fight! Between Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison. [Bobby] Every night at the local track we'd have a good fistfight after the race or in between the races or something. That was just part of racing. [Willy] Muhammad Ali told me, you might have to take care of yourself. He said, "Know how to fight." So that's what I went and did. I was in condition to go toe to toe with anybody in the racetrack. Now the confrontation I had with Lobenberg was a Deacon Jones head slap. Might hurt his feelings, but it didn't hurt him. [Hobbs] John Dick went down to say, "Hey, hey, hey," and calmed it out. Then Willy had an altercation with our John Dick. That provided the out for the team to part ways. I was fired. Fired. What we had on the track, that was between me and Lobenberg. We're two men, let us get it handled. You people stay out of it. And that's how it should have been left. If you want to be successful you got to do what you're told and Willy's just never been that kind of person. [Willy] Here we go again. How long is it going to be before I drive again. The phone rang and it was a German accent. It was Michael Kranefuss, the director of special vehicles operation of Ford Motor Company. [in German accent] "If you want, we are very interested in you to come to Detroit because we would like to put you in a car. I have Edsel Ford on the line." And then Edsel came on and he says, "You can be Willy T. Ribbs. We just want you to win" Sunday night I was unemployed, on Monday morning I was employed. I was on an airplane headed to Detroit to Jack Roush's facility. [Tommy] He's an interesting character. He's a PhD mathematician. Really strong opinion on how things should be. For better and for worse. [Marshall] Brilliant mind, he would never be accused though of having any social graces. [Willy] He took me around. Showed me his dynos and told me that you're going to have horse power. He's got engines in there running for 48 hours straight. Almost psychotic, with his focus on engine power. I missed four races because Roush and Ford were building me a brand new car. Missing the first four races has made it impossible for me to win the championship. But it's not impossible for me to win this race. [announcer] Looks like Willy T. Ribbs is followed by Greg Pickett and David Hobbs in the DeAtley Corvette. There's the leader Willy T. Ribbs in the number 64 Roush Protofab Mercury Capri. It was effortless to get in that car and go fast. It had massive power. Great handling characteristics that were better than DeAtley had. [announcer] And we have a winner of the Texas Challenge Trans-Am. [reporter] There was a lot of talk about the track conditions. How was the track for you? Fantastic, I mean it was better than my bed at home. As we were going to the press room, I walked by the DeAtley pit. I looked at my old mechanics Pat McFall and Jeff Schwarz and they smiled. They were happy, because they knew what went on. One of my professional regrets was not following Willy to Roush. Because you want to hitch your wagon to an exceptional talent. And Willy was an exceptional talent. [announcer] Even though Willy has only competed in three races this year, he is sixth in the point standings. He finished second in Detroit and has won the last two races. [Willy] After my third victory, I thought, "I gotta do something special." Helio Castroneves climbs the fence. [spectators cheering] Alex Zanardi did the donuts. Before them, Willy T. got on top of his roof and did the Ali shuffle. [Al] I loved Willy T.'s attitude. I loved it when he won the race and got on the roof, did the Ali shuffle. That was Willy. [Willy] I was doing it for the fans. Now, if you don't want me to do that, then beat me. [announcer] Our leader once again Willy T. Ribbs out in front. 10,000 people on one mound, 10,000 on the other. 15,000 in the bleachers. All to come see if the big talking driver Willy T. could win again. There weren't really many people that were used to drivers that would talk trash and get out there and get in front of the cameras. A lot of people weren't used to that . [Phillip] Willy says, "Press is press, bad press is still press." At the time all this was happening, it was almost impossible for most racers not to have a racial aspect to it. You know, a white guy wouldn't do that. [Willy] Who's this black son of a bitch think he is? [Phillip] People talk behind our backs. About you know, "What are these N people here for?" You know, "They don't belong here." [Chris] He's throwing it in our face. He's Uppity. [Willy] You guys, what do you expect me to do? Do you expect me to be a second-class citizen to you? You are not entitled over me. And that was the reason they called me Uppity. Uppity Nigger. And I loved it. 'Cause that's what you're going to be dealing with. [engine roaring] [Marshall] This one team that I worked for, we weren't even in the series Willy was racing in. I'm just sitting there, listening to this guy that I work with use the N word like it's Willy's first name. [Willy] The old guards, the old mechanics in the sport. That was my name. It wasn't Willy T. It was nigger. I used to go into the bathroom stalls. I used to see it all the time. Willy T. Nigger Ribbs. [laughs] I thought that was funny. Okay, I'm going to give you an opportunity to write it even more when the race is over. [engine roars] You wanna be mad? I'll give you more reasons to be mad. I won four out of eight races that I competed in in 1984. Final race of the year was Las Vegas. After the race, a guy comes up to me and says "Don King would like to meet you." [Marshall] Don King was regarded as one of the sports biggest scum bags. But he was also at the height of his power. So when Don King calls you take it, because this is a person who could make you a star. "Willy T., Willy T., sit down." And he went right to it. "You're the Muhammad Ali of auto racing. I'll make you a superstar." My ultimate goal was IndyCar. I knew Don King could help me get there. His lawyer, Charles Lomax was his name. Sent a contract, and it was the most bizarre contract I've ever seen. The options were all in his favor. The percentages were insane. He had an open-ended expense account. It took over six weeks just to get the contract reasonable. We were exing out full pages. We flew back down there. Don Kings' lawyer, looked at my lawyer and says, "Fuck these niggers." My lawyer, he couldn't say anything. He didn't wanna get into N word conflict. But I went angry Ribbs on him. "Look, you Jheri curled idiot. These fighters that you guys signed can't read and write, and they're honored to be in the company of Don King. I'm honored to do business. But I'm not honored to be in your company." Lomex, he says, "Don, we don't need these sons of bitches. Fuck 'em. I don't want you to sign it. But if you want to sign it, you sign it." I looked at Don. I said, "No guts, no glory, Don." He signed it. Don announced that he was representing Willy T. Ribbs. And Don went to work right on. He had a connection at Miller Brewing Company. He called them. He says, "I need you guys to put Willy T. Ribbs in the Indy 500." I went to Indy. It was like being on a date with the hottest girl on the planet. Your tail was wagging, baby. My tail was like a goddamn bird dog. [announcer] Gentlemen... Start... your engines. [announcer] Oh they went side by side. Whoa, look at this! He just passes him. He just drove past him! Checkered flag for Rick Mears. He's won the Indianapolis 500 with a hand in the air. I became a fan of Willy T.'s immediately. As an African-American you didn't have a lot of options as it relates to seeing somebody who looks like yourself on the racetrack. In the maintenance crew you probably had 25 African-Americans. So the time that we found out that Willy was coming, uh... There was a huge buzz, and, uh, he told me, he said, "If it could be done, that he was going to do it." Well, Willy T. is at Indy. Is that your slogan for this year? Come on in here, young man. Congratulations, your moment has finally arrived at Indianapolis. Thank you, well, I'm happy to be here and it's a big moment for me. Hopefully uh, we'll be in shape to do the job. Before every Indy 500, every team goes to Phoenix a month before, and they practice and they test. I got none of that. None. You gotta practice with it, and test with it. That means you can physically go try to make your race car good. And that's what he didn't have. [Willy] It was rushed together. Show up at the racetrack. [announcer] The new team owned by Sherman Armstrong in Winchester, Indiana was not put together until about 48 hours ago. And the new March chassis was not ready for testing. [Marshall] Don King brought Miller Beer to the party for Willy T.'s first Indy 500 attempt. Unfortunately partnered with Sherman Armstrong's team. You could not have brought that money to a team that cared less about putting a black man in the Indy 500. Paul Leffler was the chief mechanic. And the guy wouldn't talk to me. I got no information. I got no technical information. [engine roars] [Robby] People don't realize first gear in Indianapolis is over 90 miles an hour. You're driving at over 220 miles per hour down the front straight away at Indianapolis. When you're looking into turn one down there you look like you're driving into a dead end street. Can't see around it. You can't see on the other side. It looks like a dark problem. You had a big risk of getting hurt. [Willy] Paul didn't say, "All right this is the stage I want you to do," and "This is what you should feel." It was "Get in the car and just drive around." And I did not understand what I was doing. All he needed was a good car and somebody to work with him. And like teach him like at Indianapolis, there's four corners, but they're all different. Willy T. indicated that there was somebody on the team that would prefer not to have had him around. If you're not getting along with the engineer its real easy for him to make you look bad. [Robby] Engineer is going to prove that he's right and you're wrong. It doesn't matter and he's gonna-- I mean you're done. [Willy] It felt eerie dealing with the guy. Like he was an executioner. Driving on a road course is one thing. But driving around Indy, is totally different. Has nothing to do with how much balls you got. It's got everything to do with how much brains you have. Indy is so fast. The dangers are so great. [indistinct commentary] If you make a minor mistake you could be in the wall. And you could take off half the side of the car. A lot of guys got killed in a race car. Sometimes two in one night. Sometimes two in one wreck! [Willy] You gotta have brains at Indy. The ones with balls are dead. They fitted me into the car. I was up too high. And it wasn't explained to me that the air going over the top of a round surface causes lift. [Marshall] Windscreens made out of plastic doesn't sound like much, but depending on how high it is or how low it is really affects the buffeting on a driver's helmet. You've got this 200 mile an hour wind that's throwing your head around. [Wally] When you get in a car that's probably not handling really good and all of a sudden you're asked to go through turn one flat out or almost flat at 220 miles per hour. You start thinking about your well-being a little bit. That thing was a bucket that I wouldn't have sat in. I don't care who got in that car. It would've scared the shit out of them. There was a lot of guys on that team at the time that Willy was driving for that did not want to see Willy in that race car. They were basically forced to prepare that car for Willy to show up. They didn't want to be there. For whatever reason. [Marshall] This stupid little windscreen put on the car intentionally low. It's there. There's no question that it's there. But you really have to be an insider. Very discerning person, to know that it is too low. And as you're coming up to turn one, a corner that has killed far too many people. Imagine getting there at 200 miles an hour. Your head moving around. And you can't actually focus your eyes on the corner to turn and hit that apex. [Willy] My mechanics, they were good people. But they take orders from Paul Leffler. I knew he was the most racist individual I had met so far. He'd never seen anybody like Willy T. Ribbs. I felt helpless. I called Jim Trueman, I said, "Jim, what do you think?" He says, "Get out of there." And so I left. And by noon on Saturday, Willy T. packed up and had gone home. Thing about it is, you know, you can get hurt here and you gotta do things right. If it doesn't feel right then you don't run here. And the press crucified me. The drivers knew that Willy T. Ribbs wasn't chicken. I never thought for a second that he was afraid of the speed. Willy as a driver was certainly capable of driving anything that IndyCar could've thrown at him. Even though we knew the circumstances, Willy was basically thrown into the fire on that deal. And it was a no-win situation for him. People were waiting for him to fail. They were waiting for him to fail. All they're looking for is confirmation of their beliefs. That you don't belong. Chicken and ribs. That was on the menu for the 1985 Indy 500. That was the first time really you know in Willy's career that he got laughed at. [Phillip] Got a lot of criticism for walking away from that. But he wasn't about to kill himself. With Willy's first attempt to make the Indy 500 ending in a sad and honestly somewhat embarrassing fashion. He went back to a place that he knew where he was comfortable. It was Trans-Am. The teams, they asked me, "Well, who would you like as your teammate in 1985, do you want to stay with Pickett or do you want Wally?" So I said Wally. I just liked him. He was a clean race driver. And I knew he was fast. [Wally] In the first couple races of the '85 season, we were there to kick everybody's asses. [Marshall] First five races Willy and Wally take three wins and they move into the sixth race at Portland. The points standings coming into Portland, you had Willy in first and you had Wally in second. It was a pretty epic battle between Willy and I. And I knew if I made one mistake, he was going to pounce. [muffled speech on loudspeaker] [Phillip] Wally, he did beat him in Portland and Willy finished second, which kinda woke Willy up a little bit. And that's really when things changed between Willy and I. I think Willy just said, "You know what? I might have to deal with this guy." I don't believe we said two words to each other the rest of the season. Halfway through the '85 season, Wally and I were really competitive with each other. We were racing each other in practice. One particular race, we were coming out of the hotel at the same time to go to the race that morning. And we were both in rental cars. I know Days of Thunder took that scene from us. [Wally] We kinda looked at each other, and that was it. We tore those rental cars up. We were in the median. We were in the grass. We were banging off of each other. [Willy] We were actually going down the opposite lane. My oncoming car came by me on my right. If we ever got caught doing what we were doing on that road from the hotel to the racetrack, we would have been thrown in jail forever. After two miles of that, pulled in, brakes were smoking. We got out of the cars at the same time and it was just kinda like, in all the races, in all the years I've raced against Willy, that was the best race that we ever had. [rock music playing] In Detroit, the Trans-Am race ran with the Formula One race, right around the Ford building. Bernie Ecclestone was over because of the Formula One. I didn't want to be in Trans-Am for the rest of my life. I wanted to move on to my ultimate goal. Don King flies into Detroit. Don says, "I want to see Bernie Ecclestone." And you should've seen the look on the face of Roush. [Marshall] It wouldn't be too strange to assume that that rubbed Jack Roush the wrong way. [Willy] We go up to Bernie's room, Bernie looks at Don and says, "What are we going to do with our boy Willy here?" He's going to be the world champion. Formula One world champion. "Ah, good," I said. "That's handy, that's nice." [Willy] It was planned when the Trans-Am season was over, I was going to go and test his Formula One car in Portugal. [Marshall] Jack Roush was always known to be a very possessive person. Someone who, if you drove for him, you were his. If someone like Jack finds out that Willy T. has aspirations to be somewhere other than his car, that could definitely set some bad things in motion. [Willy] There was some components that were put in Wally's car. I could not understand why I wasn't getting off the corners. And before the race, there was a gear that was put into my car. A second gear, that was so tall, the thing stumbled coming off the corners. No one knows how it happened, but it happened. [Phillip] Willy became very, very upset about it. All of a sudden, one car will go down the straightaway and just pull away. Identical cars, that one has like, 20 or more horse power. [Ian] If he had an engine that had 2000 miles on it-- This thing's gonna pitch any time, they'd put it in Willy's car. Jack Roush was intentionally not helping him. [Willy] It wasn't long into the race that the engine detonated. [announcer] Ribbs is all over the road. He's obviously in bad trouble. When Jack Roush saw Don King come into the picture, that was it. They knew that I wanted to go somewhere after '85. My relationship with Roush was starting to fail. [Wally] Not everybody loved Willy. And there's plenty of rednecks working on race cars and they had a problem with the color of his skin, and I'm sure the way he was acting. But I never remember anybody saying, "Oh, well, we're going to put the screws to Willy this weekend." All I knew is, Willy T. Ribbs was a damn good racecar driver that I had to beat. [Marshall] When you have a driver drop off out of nowhere, you're going to start to ask why. Is it the equipment? It's rarely the driver, I can tell you that. [Ian] Willy's attitude was, you give me a car and I'm gonna take it up front. [metal music playing] [Willy] It was either feast or famine. Either you won... Or you had a mechanical issue. I won eight races. 51% of the laps, I led. Wally won the championship. And Willy finished second. [Willy] I had four mechanical failures that, that shouldn't have happened in the engine. There was a motor sports journalist that wasn't a Willy T. Ribbs fan. And he said to Ian Brown, "Did you really think they were going to let that nigger win a championship?" [Tommy] From his standpoint, it probably felt like, "It's me against the world." I knew I was not gonna be with Roush after 1985 and I just got to the point where I'm not going to go nose to nose with this guy. I'm just gonna let it go. [instrumental music playing] December of 1985, I fly to Portugal. It was a full-blown Formula One test. [Marshall] The first black man to test a Formula One car. It's lighter than an Indy car. Power could almost be double. At that point in time, I can't think of any other vehicle on the planet earth that would have been more violent or demanding than a Formula One car. Obviously the right thing to do is to see if he's quick or not quick, or if he can, whatever it is. So we had a test session set up for him, put him in the car to see how he performed. I'd never been in a Formula One car. Bernie's team manager, he says, "I want you to run this time." I kept running and I kept getting down, down, down in the time. Until he says, "All right, I'm gonna put on a set of tires and I want you to go out and put this time down." [intense music playing] I went a second under the time that they wanted me to do. I came in, he says, "Great job." He says, "You can get out. This is all we wanted to see." And I was to find out later, he bet Bernie that I would not get under the time that they, they had for me. [Bernie] And we were quite surprised, and happily surprised as well. And I thought this is somebody we can get on with, and make it all happen. So after I came back from Portugal, I got a call. "We can't put you in the team." [sighs] I'd have loved to have had a black world champion in our team. It would have been, for me, quite magic. The sponsor was Olivetti, which was Italian, and they wanted Italian drivers. Here we go again. I got a call from Bill Gardner who owned DiGard racing, a NASCAR team. And he said, "I'd like to have you come race for us." Miller Brewing Company was full blown sponsor of DiGard. And when I got there, Miller Brewing Company left. Willy heads back to NASCAR and you know what he finds? Absolutely nothing has changed. [Willy] Once again, Jim Trueman from Red Roof Inn, gave us some money to do selected races. My first stock car race was North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Klan Country. And they announced the driver line up. When they announced my name, I was booed. [crowd booing] Blood curling boos. Dale Earnhardt looked like he was embarrassed that they were booing. I can't imagine there was many people that were going to be pulling for Willy T. They were gonna be pulling for him to wind up in the wall. The old adage is... "The Civil War is dead, but still smoldering." Welcome to NASCAR. [announcer] Willy T. Ribbs has won another-- [announcer speaking indistinctly] Before the race, I was told Jim Trueman was sick. And he was fighting and he had cancer. Bobby Ray Hall won the Indy 500. Jim Trueman was very weak, he could barely stand up. But he was there at the race. It was a tough race. And all I said when we were out was win this one for me. And he did it. Not long afterward, he passed away. That was, uh, hard, 'cause he was the guy that got me... out of the dark. He got me out of the dark. After the first race, we did two more races. The final dagger was Watkins Glen. It was a road course, and that was a race that I could win. The engines that we had from Robert Yates, every one of them blew in three to four laps. This was just testing only. He ran into probably a lot more opposition as people would rather not have him around. [Willy] They knew in Watkins Glen, Willy T. Ribbs was going to be a threat and Willy T. Ribbs would probably win. NASCAR knew it. Bill Gardner knew that this was my best opportunity to win a race which would help us get a major sponsor. Never in my life have I ever heard a team blowing up that many engines. and having that big a failure without the engine builder flying to the track and finding out what's going on. Especially after the second engine. Why didn't he come up there? Right after that, the engine builder, Robert Yates became a team owner. I wonder what kind of deal was made. Bill Gardner got put out of business in two days. Two days, he was out of business. We had no more engines left. And that was the end of my NASCAR career. [announcer] We are underway in the Watkins Glen 300, and look at Willy T. Ribbs. Willy T. will be on the inside, a good car length advantage over Denis Aase in turn one. [Willy] Chuck Looper, who I was very close to at Roush was working for a private tier owner, who had a car in IMSA. Then they had an awesome engine builder. Ryan Falconer. And Roush was in IMSA. And Falconer says, "I wanna kick the shit out of Roush. Roush can't outbuild me." I said, "You're going to get your wish." [announcer] Well, look at this. Aase and Willy T. are kinda pulling away right now. [Marshall] In IMSA, an endurance race. Something where you tend to have co-drivers in most instances, it's gonna be two hours, four, six. That's a new chapter for Willy. [announcer] The checkered flag for Denis Aase. He's won the Watkins Glen 300, Ribbs comes in second and down in the pits, you can bet there's a big smile on Dan Gurney's face. [Willy] Dan Gurney's Toyotas ended up beating me. I finished second. Dan Gurney, he's spraying champagne all over me and I grabbed him by the arm as we were walking off the podium and I said, "I wanna race for you in '87." The beginning of 1987, my childhood hero, I was his driver. [announcer] What a grand performance. Willy T. Ribbs is giving what Dan Gurney has learned about how to put a car together. In auto racing, there's always rivals. Roush was in IMSA, and he was looking for a guy that was going to compete against Willy T. Ribbs. I raced a full season with Roush Racing. [announcer] Here is Bruce Jenner in the Ford Mustang. All these Toyota guys and the Chevy guys all were Ford drivers. And I've heard of this kid, Scott Pruett. I'm looking at this kid as a winner. So I said to him, "I would love to have you drive with me." I just started this relationship with Ford Motor Company. And they really liked him. [Willy] Scott Pruett was Roush's new fair-haired boy. He had orders. Beat Willy T. [announcer] Drag race to the start won by Willy T. Ribbs in the '99 car. I thought Pruett with that big Mustang would have the horse power to get to turn one in first. Roush said to his pilot, "Make sure Ribbs doesn't win that race up in Portland." [announcer] Jack Roush says, "No bones about it, Scott is the best driver I've ever had." Willy takes that as a personal insult. [Jack] Scott is here to put the pressure on the Toyota. We are willing to see his car not finish if we have to in order to keep him under the maximum amount of pressure. Roush says, in the last fuel stop, "Go after Willy, you know, he was in the lead." [announcer] Scott Pruett, who is one or two laps down right behind Willy T. Ribbs. [Willy] Pruett was behind me. Ran into the back of me, spun me out. [announcer] Oh, here's a little action in turn nine. It's Willy T. Ribbs, and Scott Pruett. Looks like they might have gotten together there. Gave me a flat tire. Cost me winning the race. [announcer] That spin was very, very costly, especially for Willy T. Ribbs. [Wally] The guy's raced you clean the whole race and you're taking him out for the victory. That's bullshit. I pulled in, Dan's talking to me, he says, "Hey, don't go down, don't say anything, don't run down there." Which I didn't. As I'm walking down the parking lot pathway, here comes Bruce Jenner and Scott Pruett. And then all of a sudden, I look up. And what's on our windshield and on the front of the car, so we can't move forward? Willy T. Ribbs. I stood right in front of their car. And I grabbed Pruett and I nailed him. Bam, bam on Pruett. He jumps out of the window. And I look at him in the rearview mirror, and there he is, standing there, just like ready to go. Jenner gets out of the car and comes at me. I told Jenner, I said, "Look, you threw the spear in the Olympics." I said, "I'll take the same spear and put it up your ass sideways." I said, "Just get back in the car." And, uh, me, I'm like, I can't believe this. I've never been in a fight in my life. God gave me fast feet so I can get out of trouble. I was like, zoom, I was gone, you know. There was a girl that was sitting in the center. Pruett uses her as a shield. They went to the press room and said, I hit the girl. I hit Pruett. But they said, "Oh, you hit her as you were trying to hit Pruett." And since he was still on the racetrack grounds, they suspended Willy. [Willy] I was suspended without any due process. Never had a driver been suspended from IMSA. The IMSA officials, Jack Roush, Dan Gurney, we all got in one room and Gurney stuck his finger into Roush's face and said, "Let Ribbs and Pruett handle it. And stay out of it." That was the end of the on-track battles. I didn't want to beat Scott Pruett. I wanted to beat Jack Roush. He cost me a championship. And I hadn't forgotten. Dan Gurney's objective was to win the Manufacturers Championship. Toyota wanted that Manufacturers Championship and they wanted to beat Ford. And I wanted to beat Roush. [Dan] We've been through 16 races. And we're two points apart. So really, the whole season, as far as the manufacturers point championship has boiled down to one race, here in Del Mar. [Willy] This is for all the marbles. This couldn't be any bigger if it was a Larry Holmes-Mike Tyson fight. [announcer] 450 horsepower Willy T. Ribbs. 600 horsepower Scott Pruett. The green flag waves. Give it to Pruett as they head down to the corner. Now you're back with the leader, Scott Pruett, in the number 11 car. [Marshall] Now these were two people that were equally matched. [announcer] Willy T. Ribbs' car as he tries to close up on Scott Pruett. These are guys who have shaved so much body work off of each other. By fighting and pounding. [announcer] Great move by Willy. And he did it. Whoa, Willy has muscled by. Scott Pruett, he is going to hold his ground and he makes it work. Great piece of driving. Just over two seconds separate Pruett from Ribbs. Laps quickly running down. Here we go, down the front straight. This is the best shot he's had right now. The checkered flag has come out just as Scott Pruett made his thrust. But Willy T. holds him off till the line. Tremendous! I think that has to be the best GTO race we've seen this year. Nobody celebrates victory like Mr. Excitement Willy T. Ribbs. [Al] Willy did a fantastic job. He had the desire. He wanted to win and become a champion. [Willy] We won the Manufacturers Championship. I was IMSA driver of the year. [Marshall] Imagine winning the Manufacturers Championship for Toyota. Winning it for Dan. Winning for your idol. This was fairy tale stuff at this point of Willy's career. [Willy] I was starting to feel, I've done everything I need to do. I need to start working on my ultimate goal. IndyCar. Very few drivers had rides 'cause they were just good and they got paid. You had to find money. You had to find the sponsors. You gotta have a rich daddy. Or you gotta be a good salesman. [Pat] You need a patron, someone who's willing to pay the bills. Because it's so frickin' expensive. I get a phone call from my dad. He said, "Bill Cosby called for you." [Bill Cosby] I saw Willy drive and I think that Willy should be playing with the big fellas. [Marshall] He's the most famous man in America. America's father at that time. The Cosby Show had been the number one show for years. [The Cosby Show theme playing] Remember this was over 20 years before anyone learned of the crimes Cosby kept all to himself. [Willy] Two days later, I was in Vegas. He answered the door, and he lit a cigar, and he sat down on the couch. "What do you want to do?" I said, "I wanna go to Indy and I want to race in the IndyCar championship." He said to me, "How much is it gonna cost me upfront?" I said, "Half a million dollars." [Marshall] Cosby said, "I'll help seed this project to get it started, and I believe through my name, my stardom, I can attract sponsors who will then really start to fill in the big sponsorship gaps." He is a fine driver and he should be given an opportunity and he should have one and it's very, very strange that he doesn't have that. Yet. [Phillip] Cosby was the spokesperson for Coca-Cola. Coke is it! [Phillip] Cosby goes down there personally, met with him, met with him, they aren't interested in racing, blah, blah, blah. In reality, they're not interested in sponsoring Willy T. in racing. [announcer] 100 miles in the Coca Cola 600. He had Coca-Cola, he had Jell-O. He had Kodak. It took a few years. We got no support, nothing. [Robby] Willy always worked hard at his career. He worked hard to hustle his money. He worked hard to meet people and try to build his packages. To bring people in. [Willy] Corporate America turned their back. There was a guy by the name of Derrick Walker. He had ran a factory Porsche IndyCar team. That deal was over. [Marshall] Color blind, someone who is looking for the best possible driver he can work with. I must have been crazy to think that I could just go and start a race team. But that's what I did. Somebody told me Willy T. Ribbs has got some money and he wants to go to the Indy 500. I bumped into him and mentioned, "Shall we talk?" So I called Bill Cosby and I said, "Derrick Walker is available. He knows how to put a winning team together." I said, "Let's get him." Bingo! We had a program. We didn't have a lot of money but we had a start. And that's all it took. Derrick Walker was assembling a team right away for the 1991 Indy 500. If you're looking to run an Indy car, you're looking for millions. And with Cosby being willing to contribute $350,000, you would not want to go any lower than that. [reporter] It's no secret that to be competitive in today's IndyCar racing requires a tremendous amount of money. Just consider, today's going rate for a 1991 chassis is $305,000. Engines are close to $100,000 each. Tires cost about $900 a set. And at Indianapolis, you'll need 20 sets. When you were at Walker Racing in 1991, a brand new race team, you had hand-me-down equipment from other teams. Engines that weren't necessarily brand new. You were at a disadvantage from the moment you rolled that car on the racetrack. If you were with a smaller team like Walker Racing, if you could buy half of a hot dog for lunch, and save money, you would. We went there with just enough money to get there basically, and as you know, the whole month is high pressure, high money and a lot of work and a lot of pieces you need. [Marshall] The disparity in budgets between the big and small teams is rather huge. I had less of a budget to go to Indy in 1991 than I did in 1985. I had Miller Brewing Company in 1985. I had just Bill Cosby's money for that one race. With the $350,000, Derrick Walker found a used 1990 Lola. It was in sad shape. We had to rebuild the car as well as, you know, put the engine in and all that stuff. So that was our only means, we couldn't afford anything else. It was, "That's the only choice we've got." Derrick Walker and his marketing guy wanted to change the color. They wanted to have it bright and chartreuse and you could see it 20 miles away. Why? I don't know. The color was, on a bright day, you needed glasses to look at it. Race cars are supposed to be Ferrari red. Supposed to have some sort of macho-racy look. This thing didn't look macho at all. [Doug] He's got this car that he thinks is ugly but everyone in the grandstands thinks it's beautiful because you can see this yellow and red car from all over the place. But you knew it wasn't the best equipment in the world. At Indy, just like any other form of racing, you've got to have the right car. And if you don't have the right sponsorship and the right car, you just can't shine. [Wally] So if you're going in there with half the money that some of these other teams have, you can just pretty much figure that you're not going to be as fast as them. Unless you have the money, and the resources and the people as good as the guys you're trying to beat, you're not gonna do it. I had a group though. I knew we were, we were going to be strong. Tim Wardrop was our engineer. [Willy] The communication difference between Leffler and Wardrop was night and day. He had won Indy three times as an engineer. His intelligence was unreal when it came to setting up an Indy car. Before a driver climbs into the car, straps in and drives off, you have an engineer. Tim Wardrop is going to make sure the car has the best suspension settings possible, make sure that the car has enough air pushing the car to the ground. Those wings both in front and back. They're like inverted airplane wings. And when that wind hits it, it sucks the car to the ground. Those are all decisions made by the race engineer. [Willy] He was getting my thoughts on how I like a car. And then at the same time, he was telling me what I would feel. This is what you wanna look for in the car. That was invaluable. [Derrick] Willy saw Tim Wardrop as right up his alley. He was, for us as a startup team, a godsend because we didn't have an army of engineers, we had one guy. He clicked with Willy. [broadcaster] Meet Willy Ribbs. Willy hopes to be the first black driver in the history of a race. When we found out Willy T. was coming back to try to qualify, everybody was excited again. The buzz was back. Our guy was back. There was a lot of hype around Derrick Walker, Walker Racing coming here and coming with Willy Ribbs. Bill Cosby's involved. There's all this craziness. How much has Cos had as far as input? He hasn't been here physically, but do you talk to him? Well, we've been getting Jell-O -sent to us every day. -[interviewer laughs] [Al] Willy had been waiting for that good ride that we all strive to get. It wasn't coming around for him. He loved the sport enough that he goes, "Look, I'm going to take a gamble here and go with a car that I don't think is quite up to par." [broadcaster] The first day of time trials. The run for the pole and in many ways, the second most important day of the racing year. [Phillip] So, qualifying for Indianapolis is called a month of May. While you're at Indy for a month, you run every day. [Willy] And every day, you're showing up at the racetrack and you're trying to find speed. So they practice and see how fast they can go and then they qualify. There's four days. You qualify the first day, that's up front. Second day, it's going to be behind the first day qualifiers. Third day behind second day and the fourth day, so on. [Phillip] The third weekend of the month finishes out the field and the top 33 cars make it and everybody else goes home. [Willy] Most races, they take your fastest lap and they take your qualifying speed. At Indy, four laps. You have to run. Or ten miles And in that ten miles, they take your average speed against all the other drivers' average speed and that's how you qualify. That's where the testicles come in. Ten miles, anything can happen in ten miles, anything. [intense music playing] [Marshall] At Indy, you've got three chances to qualify with each car. For the bigger teams, they are going to have multiple cars. They're multiplying their chances. If you were not one of the wealthy teams, which was the Walker experience, you've got one car. You've got three chances. You loose any of those three chances, temperature starts rising and the odds of you making it in the show goes down drastically. [announcer] The track is open for qualifications. [Willy] We purposely didn't qualify on pole day, because Derrick wanted to get more track time. Tim Wardrop wanted to get more track time. And so, we went to the following weekend to qualify. At that time, the rules allowed you to go with a Buick turbocharged engine and it had more power. And Derrick thought and Wardrop thought, "Look, let's get some horse power out of this thing." So we went to the Buick engine. Buick is a bigger engine, it's heavier. That took a few days to get done. So I was losing track of time because we had to totally change the car. Came out the second week, started running. Up to speed, two laps, get her up to speed and get it going. If it don't feel right, just get on the radio or put your hand up, we'll wave it off. You know, three attempts, so no rush. [Willy] Okay, well-- -Right on the ballpark. -All right. Listen for that valve in case that valve blows off, just bag it back a bit if it does come up. -Okay. -But you'll be all right. Nice and consistent. [Derrick] The engine had lots of power when it was going. But it never went too long. It was like a ticking time bomb. [commentator] Looks like we have a blown engine. Yeah, looks like Willy T. Ribbs. [Marshall] Buick engines in this era were six cylinder turbocharged fireworks. This was a bad, bad situation. People were actually feeling really sorry for us 'cause they look up, then here goes Willy again. Big cloud of smoke. [Willy] That's the only race I found. Since I've been racing that there's camaraderie amongst the drivers. There, you almost have sympathy, and empathy for each other. They look at each other with total respect and total understanding because of the nature of the beast. One of the most important people that came to see me was Joie Ray. Awesome race driver, who happened to be African-American. The generation before me who never got the opportunity. Joie Ray was a badass. Under... On ovals... Joie Ray was awesome. He came to my pit and he was standing behind the rope. I walked out immediately and I said, "Why are you standing here? Come in." "Oh, I didn't want to bother you." Bullshit. Every day that you come, you come straight into the garage. He gave me a lot of confidence. Just his energy. I was so honored to have him there. Every day, he would come and every day, he was in my pit. During the month of May, you meet a lot of people. A lot of people that you've never met before. [Phillip] Rick Mears is a four-time Indy champion. Willy went over and talked to Rick during his qualifying trying to get the car to settle down. Rick Mears had noticed that I was making my entry to the corner too soon. He said to me, "You're diamonding the corner. I want you to bowl the corner. I want you to get to the corner and wait till the last second. Don't turn down early." [man] Rick Mears became a school teacher said Willy. "You need to do this, this, this and this." [Willy] Just with that one little move, I picked up five miles per hour, [snaps fingers] just like that. [announcer] Unfortunately, the reliability of the car has not been as good as Willy's speed has been. We wanted to go out and find out if there was any problems and you know, we have a little bit of a clutch problem right now. So we want to get that sorted out. [Marshall] When you start Indy with $350,000, your money is already spent by the time you show up on a used car, used engine, used everything. As you crash or you blow an engine, things really start to get stressed. So what happens, blows one motor. Another engine blows. We're talking three motors in total are blown. We were out of engines. I think there was a sense of pity, that this wasn't deserved. I don't know how they kept going. [announcer] Derrick Walker, his team manager and team owner who actually owns the car told me last night, "Derek, I'm out of business." [Dave] Do you think he'll get in? Just a gut feel. Are they gonna make it or not? It's so hard. We were out of money and out of everything. And not knowing what to do coming down to the wire. And Buick really tried to help all of its teams that ran its engine. Scott Brayton's team, it was a Buick team. They had an engine there which was owned by Buick. [Marshall] Through a lot of phone calls, a lot of pleading on Derrick Walker's end, and others lobbying Buick to step in. "Hey, is there something you can do? We've got nothing left. We don't have money to buy ourselves out of this problem. Can you intervene to help us?" The Buick Motor Sports representative did not want to give us another engine. He said no. And there was some, some squeezing, some, some nut squeezing on Sunday. Somebody got their balls squeezed real hard and how bad it was gonna look if Buick didn't have an engine for me. [intense dramatic music playing] And we had an engine. [Marshall] And then it's bump day. This is your one last day to get into the Indy 500. More than 33 cars showed up. The fastest 33 take the start, everyone else goes home. End of story. It was a nerve-racking experience. Because you always had more cars than you had positions. So we were really worried at not being fast enough and not getting a chance. [Phillip] We had a problem early in the morning with this new motor. Oh, my God, we broke another motor yet again. All right, just smoking. We're dead meat, we are gonna go home. No, no, it's not your fault. We told them it was laying down on us so... The thing was just laboring the whole time. And then when I went out this time, the thing just died. Did you just lose power or did it feel mechanical? -Just lost power. -And no boost? Uh, no boost. So it maybe in the turbo. [Marshall] When the turbo blows, it's not just replacing a single part. It's concerns about, did metal shavings and other things get into the oil system? So rather than just unbolting the broken piece and putting a fresh one in, the team also has to do a forensic investigation and lose more time. The point is that at six o'clock this afternoon Indy time, it's all over, there are no more chances to make the show. Probably the wildest roller coaster ride of the month in terms of emotions has been experienced by Willy Ribbs, attempting to become the first black driver ever to make the race. Getting into the race is gonna require an average speed of about 217 miles an hour. He hadn't been over 210. Might not sound like much. It is night and day difference. [Derrick] We were searching for the speed and it wasn't coming easily and Willy was getting very frustrated, quite dejected that, "We can't do it, man, we can't do it. It's just no way." [Willy] How many spots are left? The field is full. Okay, who hasn't run yet? [Tim] Didier. We've got Didier, you, Randy. [Willy] Randy's not running. -[Derrick] Huh? -[Willy] Randy's not running. [Derrick] They're putting another motor in it. -Are they? -I heard. [Willy] Fuck... [Willy] It took a lot of resolve. I had to really look inside myself, and say, "All right, you gotta deal with all this. But you got to keep going and you gotta keep your edge. You gotta keep that toughness that you were taught by your grandpa." Tim Wardrop showed Willy a set of tires and basically said, these are special. The tires that he called "Magic tires." He says, "I've been saving them and I've kept them wrapped up in a closet." He didn't want anyone in the team to know where they were until that final day. [Doug] Willy thought, "Wow, he's got special tires. He's done something to those tires to make them really fast." If you ask any driver, if you tell them "special," they all want special. To a driver this is the magic set of tires. These are gonna do it. When you think that, it makes a difference. You will go out and go faster. Honest to God, it happens. Oftentimes your brain and what you think will stop you. Good engineers know this about drivers. We're all that way. We are going to be limited to what we think is our limit. It's a brilliant move. It's a dangerous move. [Willy] He said, "I want you to go out and in, make sure they're balanced, all the wheel rates feel fine." They were like glue. They were like glue. This morning, we were struggling around 210-211, and we're scratching our heads, we haven't changed a thing and then we found out we just had a bad set of tires. And as soon as we strapped the tires on, we got going straight away 215. Truth be known, there probably were two or three sets of magic tires. At the end of the day, he just made the stagger a little differently. [Marshall] The fact that Tim was able to tell Willy for once, this month we have a secret advantage for you that is going to help get you into the show. That's the one thing Willy never had. We pushed that car down to put it in line for qualifying. Willy had made two incomplete attempts so he was down to the final strike. Tim Wardrop says, "You ready to go?" I said, "Yeah." He says, "Strong like bull, cool like cucumber, let's go do it." He had tears in his eyes. He had tears in his eyes. So I said, "Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. It's going to be fine." The pressure that Willy Ribbs had to have felt in that qualifying effort has to be more than any other driver in the history of the speedway. If I did not get it done with this last run, I might never make it back to Indy ever. There was this huge buzz in the air as he went out to make his final attempt. Fifteen minutes to go before six o'clock. I went out. Going down the pit lane, to enter onto the racetrack. All the USAC, turn workers and marshals there. They all salute you. One black worker there, an older gentlemen. He was crying. He was crying as I went by him. And I turned away and I said, "Shit, I can't look at him. He's gonna make me cry." [announcer] Without a doubt, it's certainly his lifelong goal that is on the line here in the next four laps. The time he must beat is 213.189. I fucking drove that son of a bitch into turn one on the opening lap. And I pegged it. [announcer] Willy Ribbs on the front straightaway at Indianapolis takes the green flag in this historic effort to become the first black man ever to drive the Indy 500 above the speed you saw, 213.189. [Willy] I said to myself, "This is it. Do or die, Ribbs." Do or die. [commentator] Back stretch, 219. I'd like to see that a little bit faster. But the speed he comes off at the turn, that depends on what his straight line speed will be. Turn three, 216. This could be a good lap. You run that motherfucker flat out. [commentator] The first lap at 217.8 and the crowd goes crazy. They love that announcement, they are really pulling for this guy. As a matter of fact, I put my left foot on top of my right foot. I said that's just the way it's going to be. [commentator] My word, everybody in the front stretch here cheering Willy T. Ribbs on. 217, faster than he has ever gone here at the speedway. And if I crash this motherfucker, this is how they are going to find my fucking feet. [commentator] 217.997. Ribbs is flying. The white flag falls. He is two and one half miles from history. I'm either in the race or you peel me off the cement. [commentator] He's almost there. Two more corners, turn three and turn four. Willy T. Ribbs looks as if he's in the fields. Ribbs down, nothing can go wrong now. He can coast into Indy 500 history. The checkered flag falls. Ribbs has made it. I looked up and I saw all these arms. [indistinct announcement] And that's when I realized, "You did it." [announcer] Incredible, long and difficult month and here you see them back-slapping, hand-shaking, they have certainly earned this moment of history. It was a madhouse. People on the bleachers, people all over the track. It was, it was a celebration. When I was going down the back straight, I felt like a king. I felt on top of the world. [Chris] Those folks who qualify last are some amazing, amazing drivers. They took out some equipment that some of the top guys would not even dare set foot in. And then something happened that you never see at the speedway. Everybody in pit lane, the mechanics, the crew members, other drivers, officials walk out to greet Willy as he's coming down pit lane. [crowd cheering] One of those magical moments in the 100-year history of this speedway. [Willy] And I'm coming down and I see all these people waving their arms. And mechanics from the other teams were giving me a salute. And all these arms from other teams and I could tell... That they appreciated it. They were a part of the celebration. They were a part of the moment because it was historical. It was something that never happened in the Indy 500 history. It was something that never happened in the sport of auto racing. [commentator] Willy Ribbs has made history in Indianapolis, and America stands to honor him as he climbs out of the cockpit. It is truly a memorable moment here in Indianapolis. [Chris] I never saw Jackie Robinson break the color barrier. I never saw a lot of blacks do a lot of historic things. But I got to witness my hero qualify for the Indy 500. A sport that I loved. A sport that I wanted to be associated with. Um... I got to see Willy T. Ribbs become the first African-American to qualify for the greatest race in motorsports. I got to witness that with my own eyes. I was there. I'll never forget it. I'll never forget it. [Willy] Joie Ray was in the pit. And he had tears in his eyes. And he said, "You did it." And I said, "No, we did it. We did it." [Willy] The team never gave up and that was tremendous. They never gave up and I wasn't gonna give up. [female announcer] Gentlemen, start your engines. [commentator] Emerson Fittipaldi. A.J. Foyt. Willy T. Ribbs staring into history. And the 75th Indy 500 is underway. And there is an accident coming off of the fourth turn. Coming off of one, there has been an accident. And Willy T. Ribbs comes into the pits. [Willy] I went out in 1991 with mechanical failure. I made it back in 1993, and I finished all 500 miles. Those 500 miles meant everything. I wanted to show the racing world, the color of my skin did not matter. I won. I won. I didn't win the 500. I won... against all the obstacles and the odds that were against me. [commentator] Willy T. Ribbs is crashing. Willy T. Ribbs spinning. [Willy] Everything that I was dealing with, I was saying, "I won." I broke down barriers that were not supposed to be broken down. All the trials and tribulations. The setback in 1985. From a bunch of guys that didn't want me to be there for one reason. And I knew the reason why. It all came to me. You didn't give up, Ribbs. It was worth it. [rock music playing] There is no sport more exciting than racing. This is it. This is the next best thing to heaven.
