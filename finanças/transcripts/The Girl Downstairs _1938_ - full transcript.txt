- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Would you take care of these, please, I have to deliver a message to someone upstairs. - Thank you, sir. - Willie, you wait here. Where? I don't know. Where are we? Here? - Pardon me. - I'm sorry, sir, this is box n. 4. It's the Carovian ambassador and his party, sir. - May I see your stubs, please? - It doesn't matter. It's my mistake. Thank you, sir. Oh, I'm so sorry! - Hello, hello? - Am I talking to His Excellency in person? One moment, please, I'll conect you. Your Excellency, a most terrible thing has happened. Could you come to the embassy at once? A matter of life and death. At this hour? But Carovia hasn't done anything. We haven't done anything in years. What? You mean they've discovered everything? Oh, this is terrible. Yes, yes, yes, I'll come immediately. Please notify my secretaries, I must go at once. At once, sir. I know, classical music bores me too. That's quite all right. Gentlemen, gentlemen, something terrible has happened. We must return to the embassy at once. Paul, what are you doing here? It seems to me there was something about a wager. But not now! My dear, I hate to rush things of this kind, but something tells me I won't be here very long. - How did you ever get in? - That's simple, I just started a war. You see, darling, I'd do anything, brave anything, dare anything, just to find light in your eyes. Well, you'd better be quiet, if Father... Oh, father, father, father, they're all fifty years behind their time. Ane he's even behind them. He's old-fashioned, stuffy, selfish, he's... - Obstinate. - Obstinate, thank you. I... good evening. Um... lovely music. How long is this impudence to continue? You never know, Mr. Brown. I might suggest that one of us could still withdraw with honor. - I'll get a car. - I love music. Could you please leave this box? Of course, why didn't you say so in the first place? Oh, Paul, Paul, he'll never forgive you. Alone at last. - Are you mad? - Mad! Crazy! Silly! Desperate! And all about you. Let's get out of here! I can see your point of view, sir. A little opera goes a long way. Now, can't we talk this over? It makes it rather difficult prancing around like this. Nice point, Paul, nice point. Now, I'm sure that over a supper table, let's say one of the nicer caf?s... Over my dead body. That'd be helpful, but not necessary. I am known as a very patient man, a quiet man, a peaceful man. I'm even-tempered and easygoing under the most trying circumstances. But there is a limit. And beyond that point I cannot vouch for myself. If ever I find you annoying my daughter again, I shall in the most calm way, understand, turn you over to the police. - Right. - Mr. Brown! I don't like you. - I never have liked you. - I'm sorry. I'm never going to like you. Is that perfectly clear? - Oh, my heart... - The other side, Father. I'll... You know, I think I know what he was getting at. He doesn't like you. Well, what's the next stop? There are only two things left to do. One's for me to get tight, the other's for you to get sober. - Come on, let's go. - Yes, let's go. You know what I love about you, Father? About me? What? Well, if you ever changed your mind about this, you'd be the first to admit it. Now, that takes honesty, courage. Yes, I suppose it does. Well, I've always tried to live up to my principles. What I mean is... that if, Paps, you sat down and had a nice quiet talk with him, you'd change your entire point of view. What do you want me to do. ask him to dinner? Now, that is an amusing idea. You could find out all about him in two minutes. And I've come to depend terribly on your judgment. Well, of course, if you put it like that. - I'll have to be terribly subtle. - Yes, that's what I mean. That's what I'm relying on, darling. Hm. - Pumpfel. - Yes, Mr. Brown. Stop the car. Stop the car. Any man who will alienate his daughter's affection is an alienator. Nobody's going to alienate my affections. Do you want to get yourself thrown out of here? Who's going to throw me out, that's what I want to know. Wait a minute, I'll ask you, who's going to throw him out? - I, um... - Oh, so, you want to throw me out, huh? And what are your intentions with this beautiful young lady, you... ...snake in the grass? Now wait a minute, he wasn't doing anything. - I'll handle this. - Handle this... If you think anybody's going to alienate any more affections tonight... Well, if you think, that's all, so help me. - So help him. - Look at him, everybody! - Pretending to be innocent. - Innocent. - What do you think you're doing here? - Doing here. - Hey! - Hey! - Willie! - My dear sir. -You still want to throw me out, huh? - I, um... Do you care very much for this little alienator? Not very much. I do this not only for myself, but for my dear friend Willie. You little alienator. I'm sorry, but you understand, sir. - I'm so unhappy. - Quite right, quite right. - Rule of the house. - Listen, I'm his best friend. You'll have to throw me out too. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Oh, just a minute. Now. I am so unhappy, Karl, nobody loves me. - Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir. - No they don't. Nobody loves me, Karl, nobody but you. Do you love me, Karly? Oh, yes, I do, I do indeed, sir, thank you very much. Sir, I have a most important message for you, sir. Boom-boom-boom... This message was most urgent, sir. Really, sir, this message was most important, sir. Didn't this use to be a bedroom? Oh no, sir, no, sir. Your bedroom is in there, sir. Your bed is quite ready. This way, sir. - No, no, hold very still, sir. - Am I in bed now, Karly? - Yes, Mr. Paul. - Then cover me, Karl. Yes, Mr. Paul. Close the window, Karly, it's raining in on me. Sir, you... you must listen to me, sir. Miss Brown, Miss Rosalind Brown telephoned... ...to ask if you got her message. - Message? - Yes, sir. You've got to be at her house at twelve this morning to talk to her father, sir. House, twelve, morning, father... Am I asleep, Karly? - Yes, Mr. Paul. - Then close my eyes. They're already closed, sir. Good morning, sir, it's nine o'clock, time to get up! Nothing like a good night's sleep. All deliveries are made through the rear of the house. Got to see Mr. Brown by special appointment. Never mind, Hugo, I'll take care of it. Hello, Paul. - Did you miss me? For you. - Oh, you'd better give those to Father - Father? - Yes, just for the impression. Oh, bad mood for a change. On the contrary, there hasn't been a single roar. Well, here I go. Come in. - Thank you. - Sir. Mr. Brown, good morning to you, sir. - For you. - For me? How nice. Well, it's very precious of you, Mr. Wagner, to pay me this visit. - Sit down. - Thank you. Drink? I never touch it, except, of course, for medicinal purposes. Excellent, excellent. Cigar? Thank you, no, I always try to keep in good shape. Good idea. A man never knows when he'll have to use his hands, get into a row, beat somebody up a bit. Oh, you're wrong there, Mr. Brown, if you'll pardon me. I'm even-tempered to a fault. Disturbance of any kind upsets me. Frankly, my life is a quiet one. But I enjoy it that way. Well, I'm delighted to hear you say that. And I'm delighted to tell it. Hm... yes. Pumpfel. I want Pumpfel. Yes, sir, right away, sir, yes, sir. Humph, Pumpfel! You haven't met my secretary Mr. Pumpfel, have you? No, indeed, it would be a great pleasure. - Mr. Wagner, my secretary, Mr. Pumpfel. - Mr. Pumpfel. Oh, my! Oh, boy! That was a mistake, wasn't it? - You rang, sir? - You rang, sir? You rang, sir? - You rang, sir? - You rang, sir? - Are you all here? - Yes, Mr. Brown. - Katerina isn't here. - Oh, we should have Katerina. Who is Katerina and why isn't she here? She is the scullery maid, sir. Not allowed above the kitchen. Suppose we all go down there? Quiet! Now, I want you all to look at this man carefully. If any one of you ever lets him into my house again, you will be dismissed without notice! - Do you understand? - Yes, Mr. Brown. It's a curious fact, Mr. Brown, but there's yet to be a love story written where love didn't find a way. - Again, good morning. - Pfft, pfft! Boo! May I offer my congratulations, sir? Karl, there's a scullery maid there called Katerina. - Try to find out what she's like. - Katerina, very good, sir. Katerina! Katerina! Katerina, Katerina, Katerina... - Well? - Well, I've seen her, sir. - What's she like? - Well, she's young, and petite... - Approachable? - Well, I wasn't in a position to say, sir. If I'm going to get in that house again, that's what I have to find out. Give me your coat and cap. Hello there. I'm talking to you. Me? Come here. May name's Paul. - Paul? - When's your day off? Me? Why? - I've heard a lot about you. - Me? Yes, would you like to go out with me some time? Yes. Sunday's my night off, how about you? Yes, mine too. Where would you like to go? - The fair. - The fair? I'll meet you right inside the main entrance 8 o'clock Sunday night. Main entrance, 8 o'clock, Sunday night. Thank you. You could have knocked me down with a feather... ...when he started turning around like that and asking Mr. Brown if it was a fashion show. - Such a nice-looking young man too. - Yes, he wasn't hard to take. I don't think I've seen Mr. Brown so angry before. - No. - Katerina! - What have you got there? - N-nothing. - Wonders will never cease! - Please! Our little Katerina has a boyfriend. Give me my flowers, please! Oh, give her back her flowers. - Thank you. - That's all right. Come on, Katerina, your dinner's getting cold. Miss Rosalind certainly keeps her father in an uproar with her young men. You went out with one last evening, didn't you? - Well, suppose I did. - A different one each week. Say, Anna, what's the matter with you, did they get tired of you? No! And if it means anything to you, I'm going out again with him Sunday. Not next Sunday you're not. Not your day off. No, it's Katerina's. So I'm going and Katerina's staying in. Oh no, you don't. You're always taking Katerina's day off. I never saw anybody so selfish. This Sunday I'm taking her day off. Well, you've got a nerve! You had last Sunday off. Oh, now, now, that's not the way to act. It's up to Katerina. Who's taking your Sunday off, cook or Anna? Me. Paul! Oh, hello! Say, I almost didn't know you. - It's me. - So I see. - That's quite a costume. - Cos... Oh, my dress, you like it? - Of course, it's charming. - Thank you. Well, what do you want to do? Oh, everything, every... I mean, if it doesn't cost too much. It's fun just walking around too. Don't you worry about the cost. What do you want to do first? What time do you have to be home? - What? - What time do you have to be home? I don't care, any time. Just a few more left, folks. - How about you, mister? - Would you pick one out for me? - For you? - I want to give it to someone. That one. But maybe it's too expensive with all those big stones. I can manage it. Never mind. It's for you, Katerina. For me? And I picked out the biggest one of all. Ready in a second. Now... ready? Katerina, tell me. You've done this sort of thing many times, haven't you? Never. I've never known such a wonderful evening. Never. - Happy? - Hm-hmm. You, um... you wouldn't want to try the merry-go-round again, would you? - That's what we started with. - I was only fooling. Oh, why can't tonight go on forever? It looks very much as if it's going to. - Oh! - It's raining, come on, hurry up! Oh, dear, why didn't I bring an umbrella? That's all right, I've got the car. - Car? - Of course, why not? But you shouldn't have taken it, it's not right. But I got permission to use it tonight, a special favor. No, no, Paul, I certainly can't go home in it. I know what's right. Good night, Paul. And thank you for a beautiful evening. Katerina! But you can't walk in the rain, you'll get soaked to the skin. No, I won't. And I won't ride in your employer's car. It's all right, I tell you, Katerina. You're spoiling a beautiful evening. - Was it beautiful to you too, Paul? - Of course it was. All right, then I'll go. You'd better drop me at the corner, it's only half a block. No, I couldn't think of doing that. - But someone might see me. - Well, what if they do? Oh, no, no... They'd talk about it. Make fun of me in the kitchen. I wanted this evening to be just mine. Yours and mine. - I've got to see you right into the house. - No, no, Paul. Why, why are you so nice to me? Shh! Look out for the milk can. Don't worry, I can see in the dark like a cat. This way. This is my room. Wait inside and I'll bring something to eat. Psst! - They can't hear us, can they? - No, they're upstairs, way on the other side. Rosalind! Rosalind! Paul! How on earth did you ever get in here? - How quickly can you dress? - Dress? - We're going out. - Oh, that's fine. I'll just put on a hat and my jade bracelet. I'm perfectly serious, it's not very late. It would be by the time I get dressed. Rosalind, I'm disappointed in you. Here I'm willing to risk my life... Shh! You've got to be quiet. - Do you think we should elope? - What for? What for? So we can meet whenever we want to. Listen, I have a perfect right to see you and nobody's going to stop me. - Tomorrow? - Yes, for cocktails. At my apartment at five tomorrow. Till then. Don't wake Father going out. Is that you, Rosalind? Anything the matter? No, Fa... Paul. - Paul... - Here I am. Oh! I left you in the dark, didn't I? There. Well, I think perhaps I'd better be going. Going? But you were hungry. That's right, I was, wasn't I? Those are lovely flowers, where did you get them? They fell to me from heaven. Do things come to you often that way? Just the flowers... And you. - Look, Katerina... - You have nice eyes, Paul. Good eyes. That's why I let you come in here. Why I like you very much. But Katerina, I'd better go now. Thanks for a delightful evening. Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown. Good morning, Mr. Brown, your bath is ready. Oh, thank you, Hugo. - Lovely morning. - Yes, sir. Who is it? - It's me! - Oh, good morning, Father. Rosalind, what is the meaning of this? Oh, it isn't a bit good of him, is it? Good of him? Who cares... That puppy was in my room last night! - Why didn't you let me know? - Well, you see, Rosalind, I... Let you know? What do you mean let you know? I didn't know it myself until this morning. Oh, then it wasn't really your fault, was it? My fault? Oh, my fault... Rosalind, we must come to an understanding. I'm going out of my mind. But it's all very simple, Father, if you'll just listen a moment. - Oh, well, go on, Rosalind, go on. - It's merely this. Paul and I like seeing each other and dancing together, and there's no reason on earth why we shouldn't. - You're not in love with this fellow? - Well, if I am, it's all your fault. My fault? I think I've made it quite clear as to how I feel... That's just it, you're being medieval. However, I'll tell him again this afternoon to make sure. We're having cocktail. Cocktail? What? That man is not coming into this house again! I took care of that, Father, it's at his apartment. Ap-ap-apartment? - I'll stop your allowance! - All right, go ahead. You'll not get out of this house, I'll have you watched. But you will come to the wedding, won't you, Father? Wedding, what wedding? You're practically forcing me to marry him. - You wouldn't dare! - Wouldn't I? - And in a week you'd be agreeing to it. - Agreeing to it, agreeing to... I wouldn't agree to it even if I was in favor of it! - So there! - Oh! # Funny how the robin sings # # When you're in love # # You see the sunny side of things # # When you're in love # # The flowers seem much sweeter # # The skies a deeper blue # # Your heart has learned a love song # # You never knew # # The moon was meant for you alone # # When you're in love # # The stars will stand to you alone # # When you're in love # # Forever and forever # # There's a rainbow up above # # For love is yours # # The world is yours # # When you're in love # # When you're in love # # Forever and forever # # There's a rainbow up above # # For love is yours # # The world is yours # # When you're in love # Miss Anna! Miss Bertha! Miss Anna! Mi... Miss Bertha! Come in! What's the matter, Anna, I've been ringing for hours. Who are you? - I'm Katerina, Miss Rosalind. - I've never seen you here before. No, Miss Rosalind, I'm not allowed upstairs. - What are you doing up here? - The bell was ringing and... I was the only one there, so I thought I... Where are your shoes? They make so much noise, Miss Rosalind. - Where are the other servants? - Mr. Brown is speaking to them, I think. Maybe they have done something wrong. Oh, well maybe it's just as well. Here, Katerina, take this for me to Mr. Wagner. - Mr. Wagner. - The address is on the envelope. Yes, well... oh... - The address is on the envelope? - Can't you read? Me? Oh... Oh, yes, yes, of course. Even whole sentences. Well, that's fine, and wait for an answer, do you understand? Yes... I give the letter to Mr. Wagner and wait for an answer. Yes... - And the address is on the envelope? - That's right. - 47, Boulevard Edelweiss. - 47, Boulevard Edelweiss. Thank you, Miss Rosalind. Thank you... 47, Boulevard Edelweiss. - Oh... - Forty-seven... Forty-seven, Boulevard Edelweiss. Forty-seven, Boulevard Edelweiss. Forty-seven... Forty-seven, Boulevard Edelweiss. Forty-seven, Boulevard Edelweiss. Forty-seven, Boulevard... Could you tell me, please, where is number 47? Right here, this is the place. And where do I find Mr. Wagner? - Second floor on the right. - Thank you. - What are you looking for? - The servants' entrance. There isn't any. Right up the front stairs. - Me? - Yes. - Thank you. - Yes. - Thank you very much. - Yes. By the way, Karl, if a Mr. Grump calls, I beg your pardon, sir, would that be Mr. Charlie, sir? Yes, Karl, that would be Mr. Charlie. I think I know what to say to him, sir. That you've gone out and won't be back. That you're in bed and that you cannot be disturbed. That you've moved away and at present you're at conference. You might also add I've gone to Africa for an indefinite period. In a word, sir, you don't especially desire to see him. That's very close to it, Karl. You may remember the last visit he paid us. Indeed I do, sir. He dropped in for ten minutes... - And stayed for two months. - Nine weeks, sir. And if you'll permit me, three of our best shirts disappeared along with him. Oh, yes. - Oh, excuse me, sir, I'll get my coat. - You'd better let me take it, Karl. - I'm on my way out anyway. - Thank you. Sir, I am to deliver the letter... - Paul! - Katerina! - What are you doing here? - Why, this is my place. I work here, Mr. Wagner's gone for the day. - Are those your clothes? - They... They belong to Mr. Wagner. Then you go right into your room and take them off. Suppose Mr. Wagner should come in, hm? Hm-hmm, that's right. Come inside while I change. - Get me your uniform and get out of here. - Yes, sir. - Sit down, Katerina. - Sit down? In the living room? There's no one here. No. In the kitchen yes, but not in the living room. How do you like the place? Oh, it's very nice, but not as nice as ours. How many rooms have you? - Five. - Hm, we have twelve. - How many servants? - I've only... I'm the only one. Only you? Oh, then... you must work very hard. I don't kill myself. So I see. How did you know where I lived? I didn't know, I... Oh, Paul I see you and I forget everything. I came to give this to Mr. Wagner. Oh. Oh, what are you doing, you mustn't do that! - Do what? - Oh... Oh, of course not. What am I thinking of? But what shall I do? I've got to wait for the answer. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll phone him at his club and read it to him. In the meantime we'll have coffee. That's a good idea. Oh, Paul, you're... Put that down! This minute! And we're not going to use those beautiful new cups either. They're not new, they're over a hundred years old. - Oh, well, that's different. - It's an antique, Katerina, it's much more valuable than a new one because it can't be replaced. Oh. I have so much to learn. And I'm going to, for you, Paul. Oh! That's my Miss Rosalind. Mr. Wagner must like her very much. Oh, she's very beautiful, don't you think so? - Yes, very. - Is Mr. Wagner handsome? Well, I should say so, but the opinion is not altogether unanimous. - Unanimous? - It doesn't matter. That's right, if she really loves him, nothing matters. You've hit it, Katerina, that's the first lesson of love. No, Paul, that's everything. Or... are there other lessons? It's not quite as simple as that. At first you're unbelievably happy, you sing all day long. Then suddenly you're unhappy and you can't even whistle. And if you're really in love, it shouldn't matter whether you see her all the time or not. Even if you're angry, jealous, anything, you still love her. Every minute you're parted you know you still belong to that person. Paul... Oh, you're wonderful. That's... that's just how it is, but... I... I couldn't say it like that. How about that coffee? - Sugar? - Paul, I like you, Um, cream? You see, I've known only farm boys until now. Oh, so that's where you came from is it? Hm-hmm, we have a big farm, more than three acres almost. What made you come to the city? - Our cow died. - Oh, I'm sorry. So we needed another, and now I'm saving off for it out of my wages. I see, a cow's expensive. Well, if you're talking about Holstein Friesians that milk up to 15 litres a day, and weigh close to 500 kg... I meant just a cow. Six hundred francs is all I could spend. And I've saved up four hundred and fifty-nine already. - And then you're going back to the country? - Uh-huh. I mean, I would, but... Now I... Paul... You should see our lovely farm house. It's so quiet and peaceful. You make it sound very attractive. Do you think you will like the country? Now listen, Katerina... - The bell rang. - Yes, I know. Aren't you going to answer it? Oh, yes, of course. An antique. Is Mr. Wagner in? What are you doing, playing soldier? Charlie, of all people. I was just this minute going to phone you. Willie, um... Willie wants to see you immediately. He left word, it's important, it's very urgent. Nonsense, my dear fellow, I just came from there. - He's gone away for a month. - A month? - Yours. - Hm. I'm awfully sorry, old man, I'd love to ask you to stay, but I'm just terribly occupied. I'm not provoking, and I came here specially. - I had a deal for you. - I'll see you some time or other... ...very soon I'm afraid. My dear boy, I just dropped in for ten minutes. That's just the trouble. We'll have to get together some other time. Why, Mr. Wagner! Oh, Mr. Wagner... Come out, come out, there's nothing to be afraid of. I understand these things. I only came to deliver a letter... Mr. Wagner. Yes, yes, Mr. Wagner, she's just waiting for you. Yes, of course. You've excellent taste, Paul. - Thank you, Mr. Wagner. - Don't mention it. Sweet, what is your name? - Paul has she a name? - Katerina, sir. Katerina... sweet! I'm Miss Rosalind's servant, sir. - I was to wait for an answer. - Answer to what? - The letter, sir. - The letter, where's the letter? - I gave it to... - Paul, the letter. Dearest, Father's made it impossible so forget the cocktails. But I can manage it about 11:30 tonight at the Caf? Malacroix. Love, Rosalind. - Tell your mistress I'll be there. - Thank you, sir. - Will that be all? - You know, you're a very pretty girl. - Please, Mr. Wagner. - You don't have to say please. I was going to kiss you anyway. Let me go, let me go, you're not a gentleman! Take a week's notice, you're fired. - Yes, sir. - No... No, No, Mr. Wagner, you mustn't. It was my fault, all my fault. As I said before... Just what did I say before? That I was to take a week's notice. That's it, and in addition you're fired. But... but he didn't do anything. It was you! You don't have to fire him. He is going to resign. What kind of a job is this anyway? One man to take care of five rooms... ...and cleaning, and cooking, and driving an automobile. And all... and all the antiques? Do you call that a job? He doesn't have to work like that. He can get a better job than this. Don't worry, Paul dear, don't worry about anything. That's all, just don't worry. Now you've fixed it. That's nothing, old fellow, nothing at all. That's what I get for letting you in, I should have known better. Strike it on me, I thought I was helping you. Yes, helping me into a bigger mess than I was in already. Here. Here is an automobile. What do you think of that? Is that an automobile too? Well, it isn't the latest model, but I've been told that style is... ..becoming fashionable again. It's in perfect condition. You see, removable headlights. - How many cylinders has it? - Four. Four? - That ought to be enough. - I should hope so. Could... could I get in? Yes. Oh... be careful you don't scratch it. Can you go backwards in it? As well as you can go forward. - Anything missing? - Where is the horn? What happens when it wants to pass another car? Nobody's ever found out. I won't consider it without a horn. Well, I'll see what I can do. That's a good one! I'll throw it in too. - How much does the taxi cost? - Six hundred francs. Six hundred. I couldn't buy a car for that. With a horn thrown in? But I haven't got that much money. - How much have you got? - Four hundred and fifty-nine. Sold! Thank you! Oh, thank you very much! That's a great sacrifice for you, isn't it? Oh, I'm like that. Come into the office and I'll make the papers. And I'll bring you the money on Sunday when I come for the taxi. Right you are, suits me. Let's see, the date, the 10th. - Could I use the telephone, please? - Certainly. What are you doing? You've got to take the receiver off. How... how many times do you... You see, we don't use the telephone much in the country. - What number do you want? - Forty-seven, 47 Boulevard Edelweiss. - That's not a number. - Oh, yes it is. And I want to talk to Paul. He's working for Mr. Wagner. I'll get it for you. Wagner... Wagner... Forty-seven Boulevard Edelweiss. Wagner... Hello? Hello! Hello! Paul? This is Katerina! Shh! Be quiet, there's someone asleep here. - Hello! - Don't you know how to use a phone? I never tried before. - Who do you want to speak to? - Paul, the chauffeur. Hello, is Paul there? The chauffeur. - Here you are. - Hello! Hello! - Hello! - Hello, hello, hello! - What's going on in here? - You took the words right out of my mouth. - I'm sorry, sir, but she's on the phone. - Miss Rosalind? - No, sir. - Katerina? Probably wants to talk to me. - Hello? - Hello! Hello! Paul? This is Katerina! - Not so loud. - But he's so far away. Hello! Hello! Paul! This is Katerina! Hello! I'll talk to him. Is this Paul? What do you want me to say? Tell him I have a surprise. - She has a surprise. - What did he say? He said, "What?" Oh, I won't tell him till I see him. Ask him if he's glad. Are you glad? - What did he say? - He said yes, he's glad. - Very glad? - Very glad? Very glad. Yes, very glad. Tell him to meet me on Sunday at 4 o'clock near his house. She wants to meet you Sunday, 4 o'clock, near your house. All right, Sunday at 4 o'clock. Goodbye. There's something came for you while you was busy. - I just remembered it. - For me? - A letter? - A chauffeur brought it. He said to tell you it was from Paul. From Paul! You don't have to hide it. I ain't interested in other people's business. I have troubles of my own to worry about. Pardon me, please, I wanted to see Paul. Paul... Oh, I'm afraid Paul is not here. Are you the... new chauffeur? Yes, yes, I am. Do you know where he is? I have a taxi for him. - A what? - I bought him a taxi. He lost his job on account of me. Oh, I say, that's too bad. Don't you know where he is? Don't you know where he went? - Didn't he leave an address or anything? - I really couldn't say, I... But he promised, he promised to meet me at 4 o'clock. Well, it's not very late, perhaps he will still come. Yes. Perhaps he'll... still come. Thank you. I can't understand it, didn't you deliver my letter? Yes, I did, sir, and the cook said she'd give it to her immediately. I see. Karl, let me have your uniform. Katerina. Paul! Katerina, what have you done? Oh, Paul, I wanted to surprise you. You were discharged so I... I bought you this taxi. Oh, Paul! It doesn't work quite as well as I thought it would. It's going beautifully, after all it's an antique. Oh, Paul, I know you're joking. It isn't more than a hundred years old. Go away, go away! I'm afraid my taxi isn't very good. You see, you hurt it's feelings. But it will go faster, won't it? Of course, but this way you get a chance to look at the countryside. Look. Tell me, Katerina. Why did you buy me the taxi? So you wouldn't have to worry about getting a new job. But you spent all your savings, didn't you? Oh, don't worry about that. Well, what about the cow? When you've made a lot of money with your taxi, you can pay me back and then... ...we can buy a car. - Katerina. - Yes? I wrote you a letter, didn't you get it? Oh, yes, I did, I keep it with me all the time. See? But haven't you anything to say about it? Yes. Oh, yes. You write very nicely. Paul... read it aloud to me. Katerina, dear, you can't read, can you? Oh, it isn't fair... It's nothing to be ashamed of. I... I know everything about fields, and trees and the country weather. I never had time to learn how to read. But I will, Paul. I will learn everything. I want to be a real lady. You are already, Katerina. Read me the letter, Paul. I love you very much, Katerina. You're the nicest girl I've ever known. Your own Paul. That's what I wrote. Oh, the letter, it's my letter. I doesn't matter now, Katerina, I'd rather you'd just remember the words. Yes, Paul. I'll always remember. Oh, thank heavens you're back, sir. There's a gentleman been waiting two hours to see you, sir. I didn't know where to reach you. He's in there, sir. Oh. Well, Mr. Brown! - Yes. - This is a surprise. Oh, excuse the costume. That's all right, it suits you very well. Mr. Brown, if you've come here to insult me. I wish I knew how. Sit down. Now what can I do for you? My daughter is making my life miserable. She won't talk to me, I can't speak to her. She's treating me exactly as if I were a stepfather. She's locked herself in her room. She won't eat, and she cried all last night. That's why I had to come to you. Well, you've got what you want. I give my consent. You can marry my daughter if it will make her happy. - But... - I'm an old man, perhaps my mind is slipping. - But, Mr. Brown... - Please, I don't want any thanks from you! You know exactly what I think about you. I consider you a light-headed, dissolute, frivolous, spendthrift good-for-nothing. In fact, you're the opposite of what I have always hoped for in a son-in-law. Well, if that's what you think of me, I have no intention... Quiet! It's my daughter you're marrying, not me. But you'll be my father-in-law. Unfortunately. I've done everything in my power to prevent this tragedy. But now I'm defeated. Anything for a little peace and quiet. - Yes, but... - So, if you will just come to my house... ...Friday at say about 9 o'clock in the evening, I'll have a few friends in and announce the engagement. It may be that I'm mistaken about you, it's just barely possible. It gives me great pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter Rosalind... Well, Mr. Brown, my sincerest congratulations... Quiet, Pumpfel, quiet. Engagement of my daughter Rosalind to... ...Mr. Paul Wagner. Mr. Wagner has long been a resident of this... Well, why aren't you taking it down, Pumpfel? Mr. Brown, I feel that there is something... Don't interrupt me... Ugh, now I've lost where I was. Read it back to me, Pumpfel. It's about a picture, a picture that I feel you should... Oh, of course, I'd almost forgotten. Have a picture of Miss Rosalind sent to the press along with the announcement. And see if you can dig up one of Mr. Wagner too. I have one right here, sir, that's why I was so persistent. My, Pumpfel, that was smart of you, my boy. Very keen. Mr. Brown, I think you should take a look at it, sir. Who are these people? Why, the girl is Katerina, our scullery maid. Yes, yes... And the gentleman, as you see, is Mr. Wagner. Mr. Wagner? What makes you think so, Pumpfel? Well... I took it myself, sir. Well, I wish you were a little bit better at likenesses, Pumpfel. Are you sure? Why, I saw them with my own eyes. - How, where? - Outside his house. I was keeping an eye on Mr. Wagner at your own suggestion. Oh, now this works out perfectly. Nothing could be better. - How much am I paying you, Pumpfel? - Six hundred francs, sir. Well, that's enough. - You're not Katerina, are you? - No, sir. My name's Eufrasia. That's her, that's Katerina. - That's... are you sure? - Yes, sir. - Are you Katerina? - Yes, sir. Aren't I? Come with me. - Come along, come along. - Yes, sir. - What have you got there? - My shoes, sir. Your shoes? Well, what's the matter, they belong on your feet. - Yes, sir. - Are they too big for you? Why don't you get yourself some decent shoes? I have another pair, sir, but they are for Sundays. Impossible. - Unbelievable. - Oh, no, no, sir. They are too... too elegant to work in. Tell me, do you know a gentleman named Mr. Wagner? Yes, I do, sir. That's fantastic. His, um... his chauffeur is my... fianc?. - His chauffeur? - Yes, sir. - Is that who you were out with? - Yes, sir. We went driving in an automobile. That Pumpfel! - Excuse me, sir? - Nothing, nothing, nothing. Yes, sir. - Uh, tell me... Katerina. - Yes, sir? Does he look anything like Mr. Wagner? Oh, no, sir. He's very handsome. Would you... would you like to see his picture? - We had it taken together at the fair. - No, no... Yes, yes, I would very much like to see it. Did I understand you to say that you were actually going to marry this man? Yes, sir, it's all arranged. At least on words. Oh, please, please, please, sir. Katerina, how would you like to get out of the kitchen? Out of the kitchen? You're far too attractive for belowstairs. You ought to be a parlor maid. What do you say? Out of the kitchen. Parlor maid. Naturally you will get more money... ...and a different outfit, and some nice shoes to work in. Nice shoes to work in... Oh... I... I say thank you, sir. Thank you, I don't quite understand, but... Well, I don't altogether understand myself. Thank you sir, thank you, sir... Thank you, sir... Oh! Sorry! Katerina, what are you doing here? Nothing... nothing... I was just leaving. - Just what's going on in this house? - Going on, what do you mean? Well, I just saw Pumpfel, he was so jittery he could hardly speak... ...and I'm wondering why you so suddenly gave in to me. Look, my dear, I've always tried to be a good father to you. And now that I've made you happy, I want to tell you that I'm happy too. So happy, that I feel like laughing. Oh, Rosalind, you lucky girl. Oh, my dear Mrs. Delsigne, delighted to see you. Thank you. Tell me, which is Mr. Wagner? - Mr. Wagner? Mr. Wagner? - Yes, we're all so fond of Rosalind... ...that we're just crazy to get a look at the bridegroom. Oh, yes, of course, my fianc?... I mean, my son-in-law. Yes, well, he'll be here any moment now. - Now, make yourself right at home. - Thank you so much. - Did you say any moment? - Of course, my dear, of course. Unless you forgot to send him an invitation. Yes... Nonsense. I remember distinctly... What are you talking about? He's your son-on-law... He's the bridegroom, isn't he? Now, he'll be here, Rosalind, he'll be here. - I hope so. - I hope so too. - Everything ready? - Yes, Mr. Pumpfel. Everything is ready, sir. Now we'll try it my way, we've been trying your way for hours. Cointreau? Cr?me de menthe? Cognac? Chart... Just one moment, hold that. What... what is that? - A present. - A present? Oh! Oh, no, give it back to me, it's mine! But don't put that thing on! Now then, we'll try it just once more. Come along. Put it in your pocket, put it away! That's it now, come on. - Cointreau, cr?me de menthe. - Cointreau, cr?me de menthe. - Cognac, whis... - Chartreuse! - Chartreuse... - B?n?dictine! No good, start all over again, oh dear! Cointreau, cr?me de menthe, cognac, whis... - Chartreuse! B?n?dictine! - Chartreuse! B?n?dictine! - You are nor calling the cows! - No. - Nor are you announcing trains. - No. Now watch me just once more. Cointreau, monsieur? Cr?me de menthe, madame? No. Cognac, chartreuse, b?n?dictine or would you prefer whiskey? There you are. That's the way to do it. Now, will you try it just once more? Come along. Cointreau, cr?me de menthe... cognac, whis... whis... - Whis, whis... - Whis... - Whiskey! - Whiskey! - Whiskey. - Oh, it's impossible, she'll never do. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey. Cointreau, cr?me de menthe, cognac... Good night, Mr. Brown. - Good night. Oh, no, no, - You mustn't go now. - I'm afraid we must. - But the main event, I mean... - Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown... Welcome, welcome, Paul, I'm delighted! - It's an occasion. - I must speak to Rosalind, where is she? Naturally, my boy, naturally. I'll take you to her. - So nice of you to come. - Rosalind, I have to talk to you. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you in any way. Please, Rosalind, I have something on my conscience. I didn't know you had one. Chartreuse. B?n?dictine. Whiskey. Right here, my child. Liquor, my dear fellow? No... Katerina. Oh, I forgot, you two know each other. No. No, I... I don't know this... ...gentleman. - Cointreau... - But Katerina, you told me... There must be some mistake, Mr. Brown. The man I knew was Mr. Wagner's chauffeur. Cointreau. Cr?me de menthe. Cognac. Chartreuse. B?n?dictine. I'm sorry, Rosalind. Katerina! Katerina! Katerina. Katerina, I want to tell you. I want to explain. I tried to long ago. Go away. I don't want to see you again. Never again. Katerina, please open the door. I must talk to you, Katerina. Please. It would have been all so simple if only you'd told me Pumpfel had seen them, but no. You had to play silly games. And humiliate me in front of people. But, Rosalind, I did it for your own good. Just to let you see. Could I please speak to Rosalind alone? - No! - You don't mind, do you, Father? Just as you say, my dear. - It's hard to know how to begin. - It really isn't at all necessary. If you could only understand... Well, that's not difficult, your taste has rather a wide range, that's all. Look, I did take Katerina out, but it was only in order to get to see you. - And then somehow... - Shall I let you in on a secret? You don't have to worry about me a bit. Perhaps I'm a little relieved. - Relieved? - I hope this won't hurt you too much, but as a matter of fact I never did know till now... whether you meant anything to me... ...or whether I was merely trying to win out against Father. But I thought... Hysterical women are always a nuisance. You ought to be somewhat relieved yourself. And I wish Katerina all the luck in the world. Thanks, Rosalind. Katerina. Katerina. - Where's Katerina? - I don't know. - Have you seen her? - No, sir. Don't you know where she is? Yes, sir, the last time I saw her, I think she went out that way. - Please, I want a ticket to Crimmitschau. - Where? - Crimmitschau. - Crimmitschau. I've never heard of it. - I was born there. - I've still never heard of it. Would you like to go some other place? I want to go to Crimmitschau. It's near Interlaken. Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? Now, here's your ticket to Interlaken. From there you can pick up a bus. - When is the next train? - Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock. Seven? Not before? It's the first train out. Six francs, please. You can sleep in the waiting room. It's not bad. Thank you. I want you to find a missing person. - All right, how long has he been gone? - It's a girl, I've got to locate her. - Date of disappearence? - An hour ago. Well, five minutes... I'm not sure. - Well, I thought you said she was missing. - She is. I've got to locate her. Let me have a couple of detectives, will you? - Well, what has she done? - She hasn't done anything, I've done it. I've done it all. I'm very sorry, sir, but we can't just pick up anybody without a warrant. - Without even a charge. - You mean you'd have to have a charge? Naturally. Well... It was a brooch, a gold brooch. With a number of large stones, she has it with her. That's different, robbery. - She took it from you? - Yes. That is... she took it from me. - Name? - Katerina. Katerina. Katerina what? Katerina... Well, she was about 5 feet tall, she's young, pretty, blonde, carrying a bag, she's dressed in a sort of... Well, how do I know how she was dressed? Full name, please. I don't even know that. The police, the police, the police! Wait! What's this? What's your name? Linze. - Katerina Linze. - Ah, Katerina, that part checks. Blonde, young, pretty. Suitcase. Come along, young lady. But... I'll miss my train, I... - I've been waiting all night. - There you are, it all fits perfectly. Come along. Don't seem to be here, sir. - Try the linings and all the pockets. - Yes, sir. Please, what are you looking for? As if you didn't know. - Hey, what's this anyway? - That's my music... No, no, no, no, no. Come on, now, come on, what have you done with it? I... I don't know what you mean. You know, all right. The brooch you took from Mr. Wagner with all the diamonds. Brooch? My... My present. Imagine anyone stealing a thing like that. Stealing? - Stealing... - Katerina! Katerina, I almost went crazy, I didn't know how to trace you or anything, so I had to use the police... You had to use the police, eh, well maybe the police can use you. Anything can be arranged. My card. By the way, you haven't really met, have you? Meet my fianc?e, Miss Katerina... - Miss Katerina... - The name is Linze. Thank you very much. You see. it doesn't matter now. The name's going to be changed anyway. Good day. No. It isn't right. - We're not right for each other. - Oh, that's not true. I don't want a gentleman. - I'm not a gentleman. - But you are. I'm just the same as you, the clothes don't make any difference. Look into my eyes. No, not anymore. I found out those eyes don't tell the truth. But they do. They've always told the truth. Only I didn't know it. Hey! Where do you think you are? Get out of here! Quick! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
