DEVONSVILLE, 300 YEARS AGO Who's there? By the name of Jessica Morley you are convicted on this the 7th day of November 1683 in the name of this commonwealth, that not having the fear of God before your eyes or in your heart, being seduced by the Devil and yielding to his instigation and the wickedness of your own heart, about the beginning of last September in Devonsville in or near your own house did willfully and most wickedly murder your own child and your neighbor's child by the name of Abigail Parker, against the word of God and the whole of this jurisdiction, long since made and published. THE DEVONSVILLE TERROR This is you. This covers the situation. This crosses the situation. This is the highest you can achieve. This is the lowest you can achieve. I foresee much luck and the inheritance of a great fortune. I must be hearing things. At the beginning of October last, you, Mary Pratt from Devonsville have been seen dancing naked in the moonlight and consummating your union with the Incubus. As a representative of this commonwealth I therefore ask you Mary Pratt how were these savage banquets arranged and what other persons participated? What demon did you use to satisfy your want and lust that night? What was his name?! What marks were left by the Devil on your body and on your soul? How long have you been practicing witchcraft? I am no witch! I have a pure conscience in this matter. Even... even if there were a thousand witnesses - I am not anxious! - What was the oath? You were forced to render the Devil. I am no witch! I am no witch... You are a witch! Will you confess it voluntarily? On this the 7th day of November 1683 by the name of Rebecca Parson, you are convicted in the name of this commonwealth that not having the fear of God before your eyes nor in your heart being seduced by the Devil, and yielding to his malicious motion about the end of October last in Devonsville, you have familiarity or consulted with a familiar spirit making a covenant with him and have used diverse devilish practices by witchcraft through the persons of Mary Pratt and Jessica Morley. Against the word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction long since made and published. Burn! Burn! Burn! Die! Die! Damn you all! Dr. Warley's Journal Entry number 73 It has been 300 years since the Devonsville Inquisition. Pperhaps the long ordeal of the Warley family may be nearing its conclusion. Only Evil will out Evil. DEVONSVILLE, THE PRESENT Satan has walked in our midst. Not in the guise of the hapless strangers we turned against, but in our hearts. We lost science of our Lord and his teaching. We are gathered here in his temple to beg his forgiveness. Oh, good shepherd, gently gather your flock back to the pastures of your infinite love. We have wandered too long and shallow. Your beloved presence's hidden from us by our own wickedness, willfulness. Lead us back to the light. Let our sins serve as a reminder, that we must do nothing without love in our hearts, nothing without your blessing. To this end we implore your help and forgiveness. Amen. Rock of ages cleft for me Let me hide myself in Thee... I'd like to pose a toast to our anniversary. What do you mean? On November 3rd it will be exactly 300 years to the day. That's a pretty grim day to remember. You're talking about the witches. Now, now, please. Let us pray. Oh Lord, protect us from all Evil, and may the souls of the poor unfortunates rest in eternal peace, and may we no longer be haunted by memories of our past error. Well I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Something wrong, Will? No... It just makes me a little uneasy. Nobody wants to hear what our ancestors had to go through. - Everything's all right now. - All right? Why doesn't anybody want to talk about this curse? It exists. It hasn't come true yet and it's not going to. We're very very different from our great great great grandparents. Why should we be punished for something they did? Yeah, hear no Evil, see no Evil, do no Evil. Just a minute Sarah Louise, I'm working. I'll be right there. Would you wait? Now, now, Sarah Louise. Everything's gonna be fine. Just fine. Need a ride? No, I'm almost there, thanks. Where're you heading to? Devonsville, the school house. That's another half mile down the road. Won't you hop in? All right. My name's Ralph. I'm Jenny. Nice to meet you Jenny. What a nice lady like you doing in a place like this? Out of town, huh? Way out of town up there. Have you been here before? No. Where are you from? Princeton, New Jersey. Visiting friends? I'm the new teacher. Oh, I see. Well, you better get yourself some new winter clothes. It's going to be a long winter. It's all right. I like the snow. Wait till you see this one. Here we are. Over there that's a school. Looks more like a church. Maybe it was a church once. Where will you be staying? I have to find out. - Thanks. - Good bye. The winters here are cold and harsh, The comforts rare and few. The ice and snows upon the marsh we long for summer's lease anew. But legend says we got to pay - for the wrong... - Angel, perhaps they should wait until later. This is Miss Scanlon. She's going to be your teacher from now on. Say welcome Miss Scanlon. Cat got your tongue? Hello Miss Scanlon. Hello everybody. Now this is Michael over here. He's in sixth grade, and that's Anne-Marie over there. She's in fifth grade. I'm coming. I'm coming! Dr. Worley, remember the, uh, the death certificate for Sarah Louise? I need it to claim the insurance to pay for the funeral. You need a death certificate, so you can report that she died cleanly, and without complications. Were there any problems? Suffocation is not a pleasant way to die. Are you implying her death wasn't natural? Pneumonia causes suffocation. At least that's what I've written on this paper here. Here, take your piece of paper and get out of here. On this sad occasion we are gathered together to mourn the passing of Sarah Louise, beloved wife of Walter Gibbs. We all know of her dreams and hopes, yet she suffered in silence, remaining ever faithful to our Lord. Our prayers are with her this day and with Walter, but he may find the strength to overcome his sorrow. Please turn to page 92 in your hymn books, 'Nearer, my God, to thee' Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee! E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me, still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to thee; nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee! I'm sorry but the chemicals haven't arrived yet. Oh, that's too bad. Do you have any fair chloride by chance? I'll have to add it to the order. Oh, hey look, I need it right away. Um... Do you know of any place I might be able to find it nearby? You might try Endicott. It's about 28 miles North of here. Pretty good. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it again. Thank you. - Want a beer? - Ah, two cans of Copenhagen. That sure was some grocery list. She's doing some experiments down, by the way. Experiments? There you go, Aaron. And you sir, that gun you got there is not a popgun. These guys like you get a license and take their Daniel Boone. Come on dad, don't be a bully. Who asked you? What makes him so friendly? Can I help you? Yeah, could I have a box of 20 gauge shelves, some hot chocolate to go, and... This one's tastier. Oh really? You're here for the hunting season? Not exactly. I'm the new school teacher. Ah, nice to meet you. I'm Matthew Pendleton. How do you do. I'm Jenny Scanlon. What do you do around here? Oh I'm a big wheel around here. All right, Wally? I care to take some cabins during the off-season. - Go ahead. - Oh no, thanks. I still have a couple more things. I just got up here. That'd be all, Mat? Yeah 2,50. Must be pretty lonesome out there at "Heartbreak Hotel". No. Bye-bye, Miss Scanlon. Bye, Mr. Pendleton. Hi, Miss Scanlon. I've heard about you. - I'm Walter Gibbs. - Oh, how do you do. Do you have any herb teas? I have Twinings and Liptons. Oh I... I mean real herb teas. You know, Bigelow Sweet Dreams? I'll try to get it for you. Hello, Matthew. Hello, doctor. What are you doing here? I've found some things you might want for your collection. This is quite a find. My mother... my mother says she remembers her grandmother talking about a belt made of witches' finger bones. I found this in the attic yesterday. How much? How much do you want for this? Doctor, you know better than that. It's yours. Could be priceless. If I can only trace it back to the Devonsville Inquisition. How would you do that? Well... I... I found these diaries in this curious tin box. I found them walled up in my basement. I think they belonged to my great great grandfather. They contain descriptions of... of articles used by witches. They also contain chronicles of my death. Your death? Yes. You see, the executioner of the Devonsville Inquisition, who was my ancestor, he suffered from an ugly affliction. A few years after the Inquisition he contracted a disease. A year later he died an agonizing death. He was eaten by worms. Several other members of my family have contracted the disease. Those who have not contributed... Contributed what? To help to erase the guilt of the Inquisition. Do you believe the diary? Mr. Gibbs? Miss Scanlon. Miss Scanlon. Mother nature is always building out of decay. Like that old house over there. Beautiful mushrooms are probably growing from the dead wood. They're generally consider as plants, although they're completely different from green plants. How are they different? Nicky? - They look different? - That's right. And one of the reasons is that they don't have chlorophyll. Therefore they can't build foodstuffs from inorganic materials. They can only change and destroy compounds that have already been built. Now, the mushroom itself is a fruit which is produced by the mycelium. And the mycelium is... Hi, Jenny. Today mother nature's a teacher, huh? Ralph! Can't you supposed to chop the wood for Mrs. Randall today? Mind your own beeswax, Angel, I'll get to it. Jenny, what are you doing tonight? Want to pay the town? Well, I've got some essays to grade and - some letters to write. - Shot down again. The mycelium is a mass of very fine threads which are not visible to the naked eye. Miss Scanlon? Yes, Angel? Is God a man or a woman? Well, in most religions we know God as a man. But originally God was considered to be a woman. In Babylonia the supreme deity or god was the queen of heaven. It's only in fairly recent history, since Judaism, that God the Father has taken over. Hi, this is your big sister Monica on fm 94. Looks like we have a caller. Hello, you're on with Monica. What's your name? - Judy Hansen. - Hi, Judy. Where are you calling from? I'm calling from Devonsville. What's on your mind, Judy? I'm alone all day and my boyfriend won't let me get a job. Well that's a pretty common problem. A lot of men still have trouble with the idea, that women want to make their own money and their own choices. I know and I always get so depressed waiting for him. Well if he can't understand that, just tell him to take a hike. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Hi, you're on with Monica. What's your name? Hi. Um, Monica, my name is Patty Barnes, I'm from Endicott. Well I... I got a lot of problems, you know. I'm married and I have three kids. I have a lot of work to do, and, anyway, my husband, well, every night he goes out drinking with his buddies, you know, and sometimes he doesn't come home till four or five ...and then he wakes up... - Good evening, Miss Scanlon. I... drove to Endicott to pick up your tea. Thank you. It's good. Since my wife passed away I've been confused, lonely. It might very well be that I don't know how to relate to a woman anymore. You come from Princeton? That's a very sophisticated place. Things are a lot more basic here. When I was a boy, my father told me there are three things a man needs to do in his lifetime. He needs to plant a tree, to return something to the earth, he needs to build a house with his own hands and he needs to have a son to carry on his name. My wife Sarah Louise was a good companion, loving, supportive, but she was barren, she couldn't give me a son. There are only a few things out here I value. One of them is... is violin. My grandfather made it. It's... one-of-a-kind. Monica? Yes. Do I know you? My name's Ralph. I'm from Devonsville. Hi, Ralph. I'm sorry but I'm off for tonight. You... you'll have to call the station in the morning. I think I'm busy tomorrow. - But I'm here now. - Fine, but I've got to go. You know, Monica, I think you're pretty great. But there are a lot of people around here, who seem to disagree with me. It's a free country, but I've got to go. All right. Drive careful. What's the story I hear? What? I didn't do nothing. About this new teacher. What about her? Well your mother tells me she's filling your head full of nonsense. I didn't say that, Aaron. Shut up, Myrtle, I'm talking to the kid. What exactly did that woman tell you about God? She said God was a woman. And what do you think? I don't know, I never saw him. How come God created Adam before Eve? How come every single president of the United States has been a man? I don't know. Because God is and always will be a man. You tell that teacher, if she don't quit spreading this crap, I'm going to call a meeting of the town board. Doc Warley, I'm here for my physical. Don't you knock at civilized houses? Or do you believe that everybody lives in a barn? Sorry, Doc. Got you riled, huh? I don't like these exams any better than you do. But the old man says I gotta have one at least once a year. Come over here and sit down. You'll have to strip to the waist. Or are you too modest? Me? Hell no. I just wish you were a female doctor. What would you do if I was a female doctor? Trying to get you into the sack. And if you didn't succeed? Call you a quack. I wonder. Well, since I'm not a female doctor, I better offer you something pleasant. Would you like a candy? Sure. Here. We're going on a journey around. Do you hear me? It is a long journey, back to the days when the witches of Devonsville were tortured and killed. One of the witches was called Jessica. You were present when she was condemned. You were beside her at the execution. Do you see her? She's dying. She's dying. How do you feel, Ralph? Good, real good. She's dying. Why are you feeling good? Because she's getting what she deserves. Why does she deserve to die? She... she's a witch. How do you know? I saw her confess tonight. Is that the only reason she deserves to die? No, no, no. Why do you feel so good that she is dying? She... she... she wouldn't she wouldn't let... let me... let me... Let you do what? It's... it's her own fault. She... she teased me. She turned me on. She... she even let me see her naked once. I... I was behind a tree. Her... her skin. Her skin... blaze in the sun! Oh God! That's enough, Ralph! You're going back! It will be a pleasant journey back, and you will forget all about the other journey. Only the feeling of relief... that it is end. Good evening, madam. I'm Aaron Pendleton. I own the farm down the road. Every now and then I check the cottages for the people here on the lake. Is here a petcock jam? It could be. I don't really know. Let's see if I can fix it for you. You're planning to stay here for the winter? Yes. Living alone? So far. What do you do? I do environmental studies here. I got it here, I think. Oh, thank you. Anytime, young lady. You're not scared living out here by yourself, are you? Should I be? Well, if you need any help, my folks have lived around here for 300 years. So, I have quite a lot of influence out here with the people. You got some soot here on your cheek. And pretty skin. Um, hey look, I gotta go. I didn't mean to upset you, ma'am. Myrtle, this game is really delicious. Thank you, Reverend. Pass the ketchup. Here you are. What is this about this nature freak? Someone new around here? She lives in a cabin by the lake. She's testing the water for some kind of toxin, that she says we're flushing into the lake. She's full of it. We've been doing that for the last 50 years. Nature will take care of itself. I saw a few new faces at the funeral. They're probably not tourists though, the... season's over. I have a new girl at the radio station. Right, her name is Monica. I listen to her every night. It's so different. Different? Hell, hogwash. And the new school teacher. Miss Scanlon. Yeah, I heard about her. Isn't she the one that's been telling the kids that God is a woman? I'm sure she didn't mean it the way it sounds. Grade six, your assignments are here on the left, and grade five, you're here on the right. While you learn that, grade four will take a spelling test. How can we study when you're giving a spelling test? Just do your best, okay? Now, I... Angelica? It must be hard to study if you're talking. She asked me something, so I answered. Okay, let's just settle down now and we'll start with... Angelica? Is something the matter? Angel just wanted to borrow my pencil. Here. Take this pencil. Now please... sit down, Angelica. What's the matter now? Your hair. What about it? It just doesn't look normal. Now please, sit down, Angelica. My dad says you dye your hair. I mean, who has hair that color? Well, I guess we'll have to continue tomorrow. Miss Scanlon, are you in good health? I'm in very good health, Angel. How about you? I'm just kind of worried. Why? Cause daddy says that you might not make it through the winter. Hello? Miss Scanlon. We're just about to close. Well I just like some apples and milk. That's all? Yes, for now. I'd like to apologize. For what? The other night I seemed to monopolize the conversation. Oh, that's all right, I enjoyed it. You're very kind, Miss Scanlon. Many women don't know how to listen. Sarah Louise couldn't listen. When she did, she didn't understand what I was talking about. Well, what a shame. A man of your intelligence deserves an audience. I'm very flattered. Well... - Good night, Mr. Gibbs. - Miss Scanlon, could I take a little bit more of your time? Yes. I don't know... quite how to express myself, but... I'll be frank with you. I am a solitary man... I can see that. Mr. Gibbs. You can? Oh yes. Miss Scanlon, have you ever met someone who you... felt, you were destined to be with? No, but it sounds romantic. I believe you're a very romantic woman. Yes, I guess so. From the very first moment we met, I... I knew we were meant for each other. Mr. Gibbs, please. I... I know a lady of your standards can't show her feelings the way man can. Oh, I have my feelings, Mr. Gibbs, and I would show them the way you say only a man does, but my feelings are slightly different, and I'd like to go now. Good night. Mr. Gibbs! Mr. Gibbs? Miss Scanlon. You're vere sensitive man, Mr. Gibbs, and I... well, I now realize, that I should have appreciated your feelings for me sooner. A woman... needs her time. Could you close a little early today? I must talk to you alone. I'd be delighted, Miss Scanlon. You know, the State Highway Commission is planning to build a new big road through Devonsville, and I was thinking that perhaps I would develop a shopping mall where my store is. Wonderful idea. To modernize and bring this place upstay. How did you take this path? I... haven't been here since I was a boy. Oh, woman's intuition. Jenny? Oh God, this is quite stupid. Hey, Jenny, give me a hand, would you, please? Sarah Louise didn't just die. You killed her. You know? Why didn't you tell anyone? Why did you call the police? Would that help Sarah Louise? No, I was waiting for a better opportunity. You are a witch! The legend is true! It's very cold there Mr. Gibbs, I know. But soon you will be in a very warm place, and in very good company. Say, Jenny, I don't mean to butt in, but my brother Matthew ain't exactly the guy to know in town. Why don't you mind your own business? You see, these people here, especially my father, are extremely close-minded and superstitious. They feel that you, Chris and Monica are somehow a threat to the community. I don't understand it. - Just because we're outsiders... - No, that's not it. See, they feel that Monica's radio show is provocative. Chris is telling them they're destroying the earth, and you you definitely made a serious mistake by telling the kids that God was a woman. I didn't say "was"... I said "could be". They hear what they want to hear. You want my advice? Leave. Just leave. But why? They hired me. I have just as much right to be here as anyone else. I'm not hurting anyone. You want to know something else? They're starting to believe that you, Chris and Monica are reincarnation of the three witches. Come on. I believe this. Matthew... But I love witches. You are a witch! Will you confess it voluntarily? Just render the Devil. No! What marks were left on your body by the Devil, and on your soul? I don't remember scheduling any appointments for today. Dr. Warley, I'm the new school teacher, Jenny Scanlon. Matthew Pendleton recommended you. The other woman everyone is talking about. Oh, did you cut yourself? This visit is not to talk about my ailments. Come on. What's wrong with you? I have trouble sleeping. You ever have nightmares? Sort of. Of course it might just be my nerves. You know, moving to a new town and a new job. Do you like Devonsville? Yes. Were you here before? No. Why do you ask? Do you have a feeling you were sent here for some reason? Yes, to make a living, teaching little devils. Do you believe in witchcraft? I don't really know anything about it. I didn't even know that they'd practiced it in Devonsville. You do now. Yes, so I've been told. Well, your blood pressure is a little high. Nothing serious. My voice is part of the light. Together we will travel through your past. We will see what is hidden and what is painful. You stand before the judge of the Inquisition. The tense people, crowd around you. You can smell their sweat. It's... it's 1683. I'm being punished. I haven't done anything wrong, I'm... I'm... I'm going to die. They're afraid because they think you are a messenger of Evil. The judge bends toward you. He shouts. "How long have you been a witch?!" Answer him. Jennifer, answer, answer him. I'm not a witch. What are you, Jenny? I'm a messenger from the unknown. Good. Good, good. The judge shouts in your face. "Why did you become a witch?" Jennifer, answer him. Answer him truthfully. I have a mission and I'm afraid. For 300 years there's been peace, until Gibbs, Walter Gibbs... Sarah Louise doesn't just die. He kills her, and the next day I arrive in Devonsville. Soon I... I begin to feel that there's something... more than just teaching, and I'm scared of it. I have nightmares and... You are released. You have nothing more to fear. From ignorance you may go about your mission without fear. You are released. We shall win this time! We are going to win! Take two of these before you retire, with a glass of milk. Thank you doctor. How much? Let's put it down to, uh, public relations work. Oh, thank you. What's that? It's an "athame". It contains a witches' power. I've seen it before, in my dreams. I thought you knew nothing about witchcraft. I hope you'll /feel/be better soon. I felt like a normal human being when I arrived. But ever since I stepped off that bus I... felt like a different person. You have exchanged the steel and concrete of cities for the glens and bogs of Devonsville. Perhaps you are a new person. How are you going, Jenny? Feeling better? Oh yeah, I feel much better. He's a very special man. And my good friend. Let's go. I don't know, he seems familiar. His great great great grandfather was the executioner. The Devonsville witch hunter. Why do you say that? You still look a bit shaky. Better get some rest. I'll drive you home. Look at my poor brother Matthew with that whore. She's not a whore, Ralph, she's a witch. She tried to seduce me too, but I didn't fall for it. It's the same temptation our ancestors had to go through. She probably tried to get doc Worley too. I'm afraid the doctor's playing a much more dangerous role in this conspiracy. - You're just paranoid, Walter. - No, I'm telling you. They're back. The legend is true. Bullshit. Well Miss Scanlon arrived the day after I killed Sarah Louise. What do you mean you killed Sarah Louise? I didn't mean to. It was an accident. But it brought back the spirits of the three witches, Monica first, then the girl by the lake, and finally Miss Scanlon. I made a terrible mistake, Ralph. I'm guilty for all of the terrible things that are happening to us now. Well nothing's going to happen to us, believe me. Besides, your wife deserved to die anyway. She never caused you anything but misery, man. Sure seems strange as hell, that none of them three girls are married. They're probably queer. You can't ask them out. They always seem happy when they're together alone. Now perhaps I should have a word with them. Wat do you want them to do? Read a chapter of Isaiah? Maybe they're just three single girls starting out on their own. What do you know? You haven't even met them yet. Well I do. She even takes those boys from her class home with her. I bet I know what she's teaching them. It's disgusting. I want that girl at the radio station replaced. And I want that nature freak out of here. And also our dear sweet Miss Scanlon. I think it might be wise we call the council meet. We don't need any council or state board telling us how to run things. We take care of our own. Aaron, I don't think you know what you're saying. Shut up Myrtle. We certainly don't want a repeat of what our founding fathers went through, do we? Hi, this is Monica. We have time for one more call. Hello? What's your name? Hi, Mo... Monica, this is Maggie Gilbert. I'm from Merrill. Uh, I'm having problems with my husband. We really love each other, but when I talk to him about something that... By the name of Jennifer Scanlon you are hereby convicted on this, seventh day of November 1983 in the name of this commonwealth, that not having the fear of God before your eyes and in your heart, and being seduced by the Devil, and yielding to his malicious motion about the end of October last in Devonsville have used devilish practices by witchcraft through the persons of Mary Pratt and Abigail Parker. Against the word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction long since made and published! What daemon did you choose to be your lover for that night? What was his name? What Devil's marks were left on your body and on your soul? What oath were you forced to render the Devil? How long have you been practicing witchcraft? You are a witch! - Will you confess it voluntarily? - No. How were these savage banquets arranged and what other persons participated? You, you're wicked. More than all the others that suffered at our hands. We won't stand for you warping our children's minds! We won't tolerate you and your friends conspiring against our community! Next stop Devonsville. Wait! Wait! Dr. Warley's final entry number 96. I am redeemed. The Warley curse of the worms is cured. All who were guilty are gone or soon to be brought to justice. The Devonsville Terror is over. fansubbed by OK
