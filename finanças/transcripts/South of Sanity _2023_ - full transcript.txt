(engines humming) (phone buzzing) (mellow music) (phone buzzing) Hi, I'm Lacy. I got outta rehab yesterday, and as you can see, it probably wasn't a good idea to celebrate that achievement with a night of partying. (upbeat music) Hey, wake up. I'm gonna miss my flight. We gotta go. - Had a good time last night. - Yeah, I know. You gotta go. I have no idea why I can't stay sober. Actually, I think I'm hooked on that moment when I fall off the wagon. By the way, I'm not always this grim. You'll see. You get to hang with me for the next week of my life. Try to keep up.

(mellow blues music continues) I'm a sentimental person, but I'm also too lazy to write things down, so that camera doubles as my diary. I try to capture everything that happens in my life. Hut, hut, go. - [Both] Really is awesome. (laughs) - Yeah, everything. (Lacy laughing) You see, I'm trying really hard to stay outta rehab, (hand smacking) and it helps to have that unedited barrage of reminders right by my side, even those things that I'd rather not remember. So, how the fuck did I wind up back home begging my brother for a job in a flea market? It's kinda complicated. (pensive music) Rehab, relapse, and repeat. Hmm, maybe it's not that complicated. (grass crunching) (Lacy sobbing) (pensive music continues) (packet rustling) (Lacy sniffing) So, we made it, my brother Mike's house. (Lacy sighs) Oh, shit. Looks nice, right? Don't be fooled. (laughs) The foundation has cracks. (footsteps plodding) - [Ryder] You're gonna die, motherfucker. - Hey, hey. - [Lacy] That's my brother Mike. He'd sell anything to make a buck. Compassion is not his strong suit. Actually, I think he might have sold his compassion. My sister-in-law, Ila, she's pretty hard on the outside, but she's, mm, (laughing) she's pretty hard on the inside, too. But we're cool. (footsteps plodding) Her kids Rowdy and Ryder run all over her, but she holds her ground with Mike. That's Jeff. He's Ila's cousin and one of the biggest bullshitters you're ever gonna meet. And Frita, she works for Mike, and she don't take no shit from nobody. That's our cousin, Tori. She thinks we're all trash, and well, I can't really argue with that. She's right, but deep down, she's just like us. Poor girl. - Our own baby girl. What do you study here again? - I, I'm doing a cultural study of the American South in the 1780s. I- - Gonna die, fucker. - Oh, oh. - You're gonna die, fucker. (toy gun clicking) - I thought my dad said they attended a Christian school. - Oh, they do. - [Tori] Oh. - Yeah. - Toy ain't a thing- - Nice. - Boy. - Okay. - Hey, we're right in the middle of something here. - Yeah, could you just give us a minute? - Yeah. (footsteps plodding) - There's the reason why we fired you the last time. - I understand, and y'all know that I hate working at flea markets, but I really need a job. So, can I work with y'all again? (children screaming) I know y'all need people y'all can trust. - What do y'all think. - [Child] Fucker. - Well, what I think is we have leggings to fold and bags to stuff. - That's right. - Jeff, what do you think besides her rack? - [Jeff] It's a great rack. (mellow music) - Oh, hell, you're hired. (Lacy laughs) - Good, I'm going for a celebratory smoke. - [Frita] And I'm behind you with the baggage. - [Jeff] All right, where'd (indistinct) go? (Lacy laughs) - Hey, y'all, I guess I'm venting this morning driving to the flea market because Mike tells me that they are still selling meth, and they're using a stupid code word called wholesale. I don't know what they're, they're thinking. Uh, uh, uh, do they not understand that I'm an addict, that I don't need to be around this shit no more? (Lacy laughs) I, I, I'm at a loss. I, I just don't get it. They don't make any fucking sense. ♪ Clemenceau headed on the road outta town ♪ - I wanna stay clean. But when your reality is selling polyester leggings at a flea market, it sure as fuck ain't easy. I begged (laughing) for this job? What the hell was I thinking? - Uh, leopard's fine. - Yeah, yeah. - You got something more dangerous- - No, we got it, we got it. - predator like? - [Mike] Hey, Jeff, Jeff, she wants the, uh, leopard print. ♪ I ain't got nothing to, nothing to lose ♪ ♪ Gimme a stick of dynamite now ♪ - Hey. - Oh, God. (Lacy laughs) - Lacy, good to see you back. - Yeah. (plastic rustling) - How are you? - All right. (customer laughing) - Hey, look, I was looking to do a little wholesale business today. - Ah, nah, I'm done with all that. - Come on, Lacy. You know I'm all right. (Lacy sighs) Please. - Mike, we got a wholesale customer. (plastic rustling) - Thank you. - [Lacy] This is not the best environment for me. - Code five. (plastic rustling) - All right, ma'am, please take the item outta your bag. - I ain't got nothing. - My employee over there saw you put our merchandise in your bag. - I ain't gotta steal. - Oh, well, if that's true, you won't mind if security comes over here and take a look- - All right. - at what's in your bag. - You know what? I only put it in there so I wouldn't have to hold it while I was shopping. Now, I ain't buying anything. (plastic rustling) - I mean, of all the things to steal. (package thudding) - Hey, what'd I miss? - [Ila] Right there. - What's code five? - It's when we got a shoplifter. - Got another one? - Yep. - What's code one, two, three, four? - Uh, we ain't got nothing for those numbers. (electricity buzzing) - Shit. God. (electricity buzzing) - [Ila] The hell's happening here? (electricity buzzing) - Shit, shit. (Mike laughs) I ain't buying this either. (Taser thudding) - Well, shit, we can't sell that now. - What you get for stealing a fucking Taser. - It's been so crazy around here. I'm just gonna take (children screaming) a, a minute to meditate. (Lacy laughs) - [Child] Let's go swimming. - Okay, maybe not. - [Child] Here. (items clattering) - [Lacy] What's all that ruckus about? I lost my camera. Yeah, that camera. (energetic music) (Lacy groans) - I did this once. - Where the fuck is it? - You know, when I lost my NSYNC CD. - And yesterday- - Yeah, and I lost my vape pen. Have you seen it? - Oh, God, I've lost my fucking camera. - Was it like a, like a GoPro camera, a Nikon, a Sony, or a throwaway? - It's just a digital fucking camera. - Okay, Jesus, you act like you got something you should hide on there, like wearing white after Labor Day 'cause you should do, you should hide that if you have that. - Look, it's worse. It's me having sex with a former friend of the family worse. Tori isn't very sympathetic towards me, which I guess is fair since I don't give a damn about her problems. - We were gonna go to the public pool, but I'm a broke college student, and I'm not gonna pay for you, so we're gonna use your pool instead. - What the fuck? I wanna go to a big pool. - (laughing) Okay, you guys are just so cute. - This is bullshit. - She don't know what the fuck she's doing. - I don't know. (hands smacking) - Yours. (Tori laughing) - [Tori] Your turn. - Are you laughing? - Yeah. Yeah, that's good. (water sloshing) (dog barks) - [Child] God. (dog barks) - Hey, dad, how are you? (mellow music) Good, good. No, I'm not okay. Are you kidding me, dad? These people are insane. I mean, they have me work for them 24/7, and, and they have their employees sleep on the floor of their house. I mean, I've seriously never. (door clattering) No. I'm pretty sure my room has mold. (items clattering) I'm sweating from places I didn't even know existed. No wonder Lacy just came to California and just stayed with us a long as she did and went to rehab. Love you, too. (door clattering) Bye. (mellow music) - Another morning at the Hilgreen's. The sun is shining. The birds are chirping, and a bad decision is inevitable. I thought you said this was a new go-kart. - Yeah, well, new to them. (energetic music) - Cheap-ass used go-kart. (Lacy laughs) - You know what? I fucking paid for it, and the thing to me is why, why does Santa Claus get all the credit? Well, this- - So- - woulda been- - This isn't supposed to be Christmas time, right? - This would've been a good Christmas present if you'd given it to 'em at Christmas. - Well, they're gonna love it. They're gonna love it. - All right. - And, and I'm the one who paid for it. All right, here's what I want you to do. Close that up. We're gonna bust through this bitch. - Why? - You talk about, you talk about surprise. Wait till, wait till you see this. (door clattering) (Lacy grunts) In all the way. - [Lacy] I can't get it closed. - Michael, we can't bust through that door. - We can. - What are you thinking? - This is gonna be- - Mm-mm. - [Mike] All right, fuck it. Open it up. - It's not closing. - [Mike] No, no, open it up. - Shit. (Lacy grunts) (door clattering) - It'll be, it'll be just as good coming this way. - It's not safe. - No, it's gonna be just as good coming out. All right, Jeff, we are a go. We are a go. I want you to keep the kids on the side. Keep 'em on the side. I wanna surprise 'em. All right, it is a go, and tell 'em that, uh, tell 'em that Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus (laughing) are coming out. - [Ila] I, (hand thudding) Oh. - Yeah. (engine revving) - Oh, Mike, hey, watch that bar. - I know, or I'm fucked. - I'll be out here. (engine revving) - You good? Oh, man. - All right, hold on, hold on. - Okay. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Ah, oh. (go-kart clattering) - Merry Christmas, bitches. (Ila laughing) (energetic music) (engine revving) - [Ila] Go, go, go. - [Lacy] If the choice falls down the used versus new, Mike will always choose used. He says that's because kids get bored with stuff. Then, you're just throwing away money for no damn reason. - (sobbing) I never get to catch 'em. - [Lacy] Oh, and if you're worried about Rowdy, he's a tough kid. Honestly, by now, I think his body's, like, 85% scar tissue. - [Rowdy] I wanna catch 'em. (mellow music) - Hmm, back here again, and just in case you're starting to think that flea market ain't so bad, this is for you. - Oh, where's the bathroom? I need a bathroom now, now, now. Oh, my God, nevermind. Oh. - I don't think I'd pee here. - Weird. (hangers clanking) Seriously? (urine pattering) - [Customer] Oh. (urine pattering) - Wait, what the hell are y'all doing? Y'all just gonna let customers piss on my shit? Security, get over here. (urine pattering) - What's going on here? - Well, take a look. - [Security] Oh, my God. (customer exhaling) I don't get paid enough for this shit. - All right, okay, all right, all right. Get your hands off. Get your hands off of me. I'm still peeing a little bit. - Had some fucked up shit out here today. All right? Now, I ain't saying it was your fault. Sure as hell ain't mine. (hand thudding) - Daddy, I found it in the bathroom shower. (quizzical music) - [Mike] That ain't no teabag. - I didn't do it. - Ain't nobody's speaking up? - It's mine. - All right then, do a little process of elimination. I know for sure it ain't Ila 'cause I know, and I know it ain't Jeff 'cause I know. That leaves one of two people. Either my sweet little sister or my bum fuck cousin. - I had my period last week, and if I'd've taken out in the shower, (laughs) I'd have put it in the damn trash. - Yeah, man, she's right. She definitely had her period last week. - I did it. But you know, at least you don't have to explain women's menstruation to him now. I think all women should be able to do that. They're creating a lining in their uterus that they're going to shed and have a baby. - And I think that, if women wanna take a shit in the shower, they should be able to do that, too. You know, we, we should have the same toilet rights as men. - Once again, made it all about you. Come on, Rowdy. (cup thudding) (chair clattering) (footsteps plodding) - Thanks. - Okay, look. (mellow music) - I need to find this damn camera, so I need you to do me a solid. (engine humming) And by solid, I just needed Tori to pretend to be me and go on a date with a wholesale customer from my brother, giving me time to find my camera. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy. You know a Southern girl never goes there on a first date. And plus, it is shark week down south, and the dollar store's outta razor's last time I checked. I had such a great time, good night. Ah.

You drink it for the, you know- - The feeling. - Yeah, you know, get you little bit- - Yeah, I don't drink for the- - Yeah. - for the taste. - I like it, man. I love it.

If that minnow's alive, you know that got good water. But if that minnow's dead, you don't use that water. - Minnow like a fish? - No. Yeah, like a fish. That's just 'bout ready and run.

And this old coil over here where we got this water in here, we gotta keep it cool. - You two almost burnt the house down. - [Lacy] We had it under control. (laughs) - Yeah. It's all fun and games, till somebody dies. - Jabo said it's gotta be really hot, right, to make good moonshine. (steam hissing) And- - It got hot. - And it did get hot. (Mike laughs) It got hot. (steam hissing) But the problem was that we didn't get to the, the, the last part is you gotta make sure it cools down, and, and, well, he doesn't really read the temperature gauge. (container clanking) He doesn't go by that. So, it just started smoking (laughs), and it just started going, and just started shaking, and wobbling, and, well, everything just went to shit, basically.

Did I stutter? - So, we had a bit of a shit storm today at school 'cause one of y'all left an adult baggie of gummy bears after the party last night. Little Rowdy got into 'em. - Oh, come on. Those party favors were left out for everybody. We all got messed up. (Ila sighs) If some got left out accidentally, it ain't nobody's fault. - [Rowdy] Let's have some cake. (quirky music) - This (laughing) ain't good. It don't do no good to go worrying about things you can't control. Sometimes you just gotta hope for the best and let things work themselves out even if that thing is a kid tripping balls after eating meth gummy bears.

(equipment clanking) - We gotta put this back together, y'all. - We'll do it later. - If Lacy hadn't been talking shit about black holes and medication to our son, (equipment clanking) then child services wouldn't even be on their way here. - It's meditation, and it ain't my fault you got all fucked up and left the gummy bears out.

You wanna come in? You don't have to- - I'll help you out right now. - Okay, all right. - Come on out. Come on in. - All right. - Oh, my God. - That's good. Come on. (Ms. Jones clearing throat) - Thank you. - Yeah. That's hospitality in the South. - Uh, yeah. - That's what they tell me. - Yeah, yeah, that's what I hear. - [Tori] Oh, yeah. - Seriously, they're on their way. We gotta, look. - We can't do this. - [Lacy] We gotta take it out back. - I don't know where they are. I'm sorry. - Okay. - But you can look for 'em. - Okay. - Oh. (door clattering) - Come on in. What's up? (door clattering) - Uh, we're with child services. I'm Mr. Keith. This is my partner, Ms. Jones. We're here to look in on a, uh, uh, Rowdy and Ryder. You guys, uh, uh, you guys mind if we take a look around? - Absolutely, take, make yourself at home. - [Mr. Keith] All right, all right. - Mike, where are the fucking kids? (Lacy gasping) - Hi, I'm Lacy. - Hey. - I'm the aunt. Hi. I'll just, uh, I'll show y'all around. - All right, thank you. - Hey. Just follow me. It's, it's a little messy. Um, we, we were- - My casa is su casa. (Ms. Jones and Lacy laughing) - [Lacy] We work from home, see. - And what exactly is it that your family does? - Oh, we work in the flea market business. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. - [Mr. Keith] How's that going? - Oh, it's good. It's good, I mean, ups and downs, but it's good. - Look at that. - Your fucking ass. - Ah. (Lacy moaning) - Oh, my God. (hand smacking) - [Ryder] Look at that fucking they were on. - Look at that butt and soggy with choo-choos. (upbeat music) - Give me the camera. Give me the camera now. Ryder, Ryder, give me the camera. (kids chattering indistinctly) - Oh, my God. - Give me the camera. - [Rowdy] I want some gummy bears. - What do you think the most likely scenario is here, Matty? - It's Matt. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but your kid got hopped up on meth gummy bears and was sent home to you. You were forewarned that child services would be arriving the next morning to check in on the household, but you neglected to get your affairs in order and to clean up the house. Then, child services came in and found the boys dressed in girls' leggings watching a sex tape with your sister, who just got back from rehab. Now, does that about sum it up? - Pretty much. (crickets chirping) - [Friend] How's your herpes? - Why are you asking her about herpes? (Tori inhaling) I mean, I had shingles once, and it hurt like shit. - I found a bottle of herpes medication in my boyfriend's bathroom, and that's what you just reminded me of, but that's the same medication for shingles. - [Ila] Mm-hmm. - So- - Mm-hmm. - I'm, I'm fine. - How do you know it was shingles? Is this the same guy that you said hadn't slept with you in a few weeks? - I mean, it could be shingles, but that's what I thought. - Mm-mm. Is this the same guy that you said couldn't get you off very well? - [Ila] Well, damn, that ain't worth it. Lemme see a picture of him. - Mm. - Oh, he's hot. - Yeah. - Yeah. (Tori sighs) - He's a tattoo artist. I normally wouldn't go for those kind of people, but- - [Ila] Mm-hmm. - Hmm, he did a pretty good job of getting me off. - You set me up with him. (lighter clicking) - Yeah. (quirky music) - Herpes runs in my family. - To live in this family is like survival of the fittest or sanest. Sometimes the environment that is almost impossible to live in is the one that makes you feel the most alive. Okay, I'm gonna get you fuckers up to speed since the world is a full-on shit show right now. And let's face it, it's been a while. (laughs) And, boy, did y'all miss some shit. (mellow music) After we got that letter, we moved, thinking we could outsmart CPS, and Tori ran back to California with her tail between her legs. And then, my fucktard family had another hellion, (baby screaming) (laughing) which of course, slowed us down. (baby screaming) And that was that. But my family blames me mostly for the kids getting taken away. But that was only partly my fault. (tense music) And then, to make matters worse, (sighs) I had to get my beautiful boobies, which you all can vouch for because you're following my story, cut off by a surgeon because my demon jeans are trying to kill me. And now, I'm stuck out here away from my family, (sighs) waiting for another reconstructive surgery in an RV with this asslick one-night-stand that I hardly even know in the middle of a pandemic quarantine bullshit. - Lace. (upbeat music) (door clattering) - Jesus, fucking, Lick. (head thudding) - What are you doing? Hey, is that your bro? Is he sending us some more wholesale shit to move? - No, this is my video diary, and I done told you Mike don't know that you helped with that last shipment, so you can't say nothing about that. - Oh, yeah, right. I forgot. All right, well, no worries. He's gonna grow to love me. Who wouldn't? - Shit, dude. - It's pretty nice out. You wanna go for a walk or something, take this fucked up haircut you gave me here out for a spin? - [Lacy] Yeah, I guess. - All right, cool. Let's go. (door clattering) (Ila sighs) (phone beeping) - Hey. - Hey, what are you doing? - (sighs) I'm going over these figures. I'm not selling anything online. How are you doing? - I'd be better my wife would let me in my own house. - Well, you are technically in your house, okay? You just keep breaking the rules, Mike. I told you you had to do a 14-day quarantine. That was it, and I keep hearing that door opening, so I know you're going somewhere. - I can go anywhere. I did one of them home tests, and I tested positive. I got the antibodies. - Yeah? Who'd you order that from? (paper rustling) - [Mike] A reliable source. - Probably your trainer, and if you believe what that test says, you're dumber than an AIDS sex party. - You know, look, going to the golf store, it's a necessary item. It's essential. What do you want me to do, go stir crazy? And by the way, when I'm out there, I'm, like, 200 yards away from anybody, mainly 'cause I hit the ball about 50 yards farther than anybody, further, I'm saying. - Well, honey, I agree with you mostly. God's got the steering wheel on this whole thing. - I ain't saying he don't. - Mike, it's not about me. It's not me I'm concerned about, okay? I mean, we will not be allowed visitation with the kids if that's even a possibility during this time. And Lacy can't come help us because we are being careless and not following the rules. I mean, she keeps telling me she's got this immunity compromised. - We ain't gonna even be able to see the kids until this quarantine is lifted anyway. And Lacy's supposed to be helping us, right? I mean, she owes us one. (phone ringing) I gotta go. I found my ball. - Mike, who is? (upbeat music) (notifications chiming) - Fuck, fuck, fuck. Never get this shit to work. - Yo. - [Lacy] Meet Birdie. We like to call her FMH, functioning meth head. She's in a category all her own, rare but does exist. You're just meeting her now because Mike had fired her because she accidentally took downers at work and passed out face down in a box, but he's since rehired her. Are you seeing a pattern? - This video chat shit's for the birds. - Oh, hang on a second. (phone ringing) Got some business to attend to. FU Inc., what's up? - Hey, man, look. (hand thudding) You take credit cards? - No, no cards. Cash App, Venmo, cash. - You take Cash App? (laughs) - Yeah, you have to talk to my associate. Birdie. - Yeah, just get my Venmo. - I'm gonna text you. (phone beeping) All right, back to business. Yeah, the good news is I tested positive for the antibodies. But the bad news is Ila doesn't believe that shit. - Wait, didn't I tell you? - Tell me what? (dramatic music) Birdie's been helping me out with some shit. And since all of her friends haven't gotten sick, she did some research, and she found out that, if you've ever done meth on any regular basis, at any time in your life, you're immune. (Lacy laughs) - Online, and by the way, I passed an antibodies test. - Yeah, from your reliable source. Ila told me. - Hey, you don't get it. I passed an antibodies test, damn right, and by the way, (coughs) I'm like a walking brick of gold 'cause I can sell 'em. (paper rustling) See that? - Look, I'm all for it. I'm sure there'll be a line of people waiting around the corner for you (laughs) to inject your unproven, untested vials of antibodies into 'em. I mean, this is your beloved Trump country. - Damn right. (mellow music) (tray rasping) Hold on a second. Oh, man. Look at this shit. See that? - Yeah. You know, I think maybe Ila has y'all separated for a reason. Maybe it's an excuse to give her some more time to spend with her newfound love, you know, the big man upstairs. - [Ila] Mike, you see your food? - Yeah, I got em, thanks. - Hey, Ila, I got your text earlier. I'll give you a call later. - [Ila] 'Kay. (upbeat guitar music) - What's that noise? - That's Lick. (upbeat guitar music continues) - What kinda name is that? No, you know what? Don't tell me. I don't even wanna know. - No, dummy. I went out one night. I'm new in town, and so all these people are calling this guy Lick, so I'm thinking I'm gonna get some good face sitting in. But that is not near the reason this guy is called Lick. He's more of a freeloading asslick. Lick, I'm on the damn phone. (guitar continues twanging) - That shit would drive me crazy if I had to live with that all day. You're gonna look just as crazy when you get your hair done. - Shut up, but that does bring me to a point. Good news, I'm all outta that last wholesale shipment that you sent me. Something you might not be too keen on, though, is that Lick made the deliveries for me. - Who the fuck is this guy? Lacy, do you not, do you not understand the difference between being under the radar and then being a fucking bullseye? That's what this shit does. - I understand your concern, but I can't go out in this at the moment. I'm immunocompromised, and I'm stuck with this guy right now. Plus, I think you're really gonna like him. - Is that Mike? Mike. Dude, you're my idol, bro. Your business mind, it's, it's awe-inspiring. You keep planting those mines, people are gonna walk on 'em, and (imitates mine exploding) they're gonna explode, and bloody chunks of business are gonna be everywhere, and everybody's gonna know Mike. Awesome, dude. - Appreciate it. - Yeah. He's not the brightest. (guitar twanging) - I'm fucked. - We'll talk later, though. - Yeah. Lick. (computer beeping) - Well, you, you shaved. Who you cleaning up for? - Everybody. Tired of getting shit from you. Lacy said it looked like Grizzly Adams. And I figured also we were going to see the kids. It'd be good to clean up a little bit, so, oh, and Lacy, by the way, is seeing some dude named Lick, Lick, and, uh, he's selling our product. - Okay, I, I don't want to talk about that. I don't have any knowledge about what's going on with that side of the business. We have to talk to our attorney to figure out a time when we can talk to our kids. - Dammit, Ila, we used to talk about everything. You know that, right? I mean, we, before your dad died, and our kids got taken away, we talked about everything, but now you, you just bury your head in the, in the damn Bible. And you know, I, I lost 'em, too. And we need to have a unified front. (mellow music continues) - I got you. (hands thudding) (computer beeping) (gentle guitar music) (computer beeping) - [Lacy] I thought you quit. - Oh, I did. Don't tell Mike. - He's mad enough of me already, (Ila laughs) but I can't get exposed to this shit. And his dumb thinks he's immune. - Yeah. - You know, I've been fighting with my insurance for three full days on them not wanting to pay out-of-state claims? (Ila scoffs) So, now I gotta find new insurance during a pandemic. It's all a fucking scam. - Uh, that's what my daddy used to say, and you know what? I was just flipping through some pictures before you called, and, um, (sighs) I really miss him. I, I don't think I ever got a chance to grieve. - I don't think you were given the opportunity. I mean, you had Rebel, and then Jabo and I got sick at the same time. And then, right after that, you were dealing with CPS. - Yeah, I know. And you know, I used to go and sit in his room and just talk to him after, after he was gone. And one day, I was in there praying, and when I finished, um, I looked at his picture and, and there, there were actual tears streaming down his face. (laughing) Now, I know you're not gonna believe me. - You know, everybody gets through stuff their own way. I know we joke about you finding Jesus and all that, but if it works for you, it works for you, Shit, I believe in everything. You name it, I believe it, except for that flat earth crap. I just cannot buy into all that. And y'all been making fun of me for years. (Ila laughs) - Well, but you know, um, I, I think that all of this is, uh, is really starting to get to me. - Well, I have an idea. Why don't we get everybody on a video chat, and we can all show photos and videos we have of Jabo. I think it'll be good for everybody. - Oh, I don't, I don't know. I don't know if I'm, uh, I don't know if I'm really ready for that. - Well, then I could just send the photos and videos I have, and you can look at 'em on your own time. (gentle guitar music continues) - What I really need from you is for you to upload that product list and get the descriptions in because we have got to start selling some stuff. - Well, I can try, but you have not given me the correct inventory, so it might just be- - Hey, Ila. - a big mess. - [Mike] Get, get Jeff's number. - Hey, I got, I'll talk to you later, okay? (computer beeping) (gentle guitar music continues) (vape thudding) (Lacy sighs) (headset clacking) - Ow, fuck, bitch. - I'm on the damn phone. - What is it? (mellow music) - Ila, do you have Jeff's correct number? - I think so, don't you? - No, I, I've called, like, four different numbers, and none of 'em work. How many burners does that boy use in a week? I mean, I've been, I've been trying to get in touch with him for, like, four days. - I'll forward you the numbers I have. (notifications chiming) - Dammit, I have all those numbers. All right, forget it. I'll just try to call Keisha or Birdie. (mellow music continues) (computer beeping) - Hey, Mike, what's up? - I'm trying to get in touch with Jeff. (Birdie laughs) Actually, can you, uh, can you set up a meeting with you, me, Jeff, uh, Rosie, Keisha, Tammy, and Frita? And, uh, I wanna, I wanna see, uh, figure out a way for y'all to bring in some income. - Yeah, I'll get in touch with 'em. - Okay, and just let me know when you, we can do, like, a, a group chat. - Yep. - All right, see ya. - All right, bye. (computer beeping) - Okay, so, so what you're saying, Matthew, is that we won't even be able to get a hearing until after the quarantine? - Uh, yes, Ila, and even then, the courts are gonna be swamped. I'm sorry, this has just taken a lot longer in time than normal to get it scheduled. - Our kids are with another family and have been for almost a year. They can't do this. - Well, I was able to set up a video chat with the kids for ya tomorrow. Beyond that, you know, my hands are tied until we can get with the court administrator to set up a hearing with the judge. - Thank you for all you're doing, Matthew. - We'll talk soon. (computer beeping) - I mean, at least we get to talk to 'em tomorrow. - Through a computer screen. I gotta go. (computer beeping) - Hey, Mike, I know that you've been trying to get in contact with me and everything, but I've been down with my diabetes, and I still not feeling very good right now. So, I had got my cousin, Keisha, the one that worked with us last time, since she know how to do the repack, and the wholesale, and everything to come work for me in my place if that was okay with you. I will talk to you later. Thanks, Mike. - It took you long enough to figure this out, but that's why there's only one Bill Gates here. - Damn, Mike, I was trying to get Jeff in on this video chat before I set it up, but turns out he done checked himself into rehab again. - Is that the latest story? What do you gotta say about it, Roses? - Shit, you know, Jeff, man, always gotta keep you on your toes, stealthy. - [Lacy] Rosie here'll do anything for ya. Always gets stuck with a shit detail and rarely sticks up for himself. I'm thinking his self-esteem took a major hit when he was 12, and he shit himself in a Roses discount store. That's how he got stuck with the name Rosie. Oh, if you don't know what Roses is, it's the white trash version of Service Merchandise. Crap, if you don't know what Service Merchandise is, it's the white trash version of Walmart. - [Mike] This bullshit's the same every day. - Shit, look, if I'da known you trying to get in touch with me, Mike, I'da called your ass back lickety-Goddamn-split, and you know this. - What do you say, Keisha? - Same here. I ain't trying to lose my job during these times, man. I got children, shit. - [Lacy] Keisha, Frita's cousin, same attitude, same fashion sense, will work no matter what the job is, but you better show her some damn respect. - There's a way to make money if y'all wanna do it. You just gotta go down to the warehouse, do some repackaging, make sure all the wholesale shit's going through, make sure Lacy's all stocked up. And by the way, Rosie, you gotta stop this bullshit of me having to find you like your cousin, all right, regardless of this stealthy bullshit. - No, no, no, look, I know where my bacon gets buttered, brother, so if I change my number, you gonna be the first one to know it. - That's all bullshit. All right, so, so, uh, Birdie, uh- - Yeah. - I'm gonna see you tomorrow at the warehouse. We're gonna do some repackaging, and I gotta get out this fucking house. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. Uh, let me know if you need anything else. - I'll do some, uh, deliveries. I can check in with Lacy, see what she needs. - Hey, me too, I can do repackaging and deliveries. - I can help with repackaging. - All right, Keisha. - Yeah. - Want you to stay on the line for a minute if you would, and, uh, rest of y'all, I'll see you later. And, uh- - Bye. - Birdie, I'll see you tomorrow. - All right, bye. - Bye. - Bye. (computer beeping) - Keisha, I, what I wanted to say was, uh, why don't you hold off, uh, going by the warehouse 'cause, uh, I, I know all you Black people got it. - All Black people got what? - Don't worry. I got the antibodies, so I'm just, all I'm trying to do is for right now is just try to figure out how to extract them and sell 'em. And since you're one of my employees, I'm gonna give you a hell of a discount. - Man, you ain't putting none of your junk up inside of me. I'll take my chances. - I'm just trying to help. I mean, you could be on, like, a breathing tube by the end of next week. - Man, (laughs) you crazy. I need money, so I am going to work. Sell your bodies to some other idiot, fool. - I might even do like a two for one. - Really? - You got, like, a friend or somebody in the family? - I can't believe you. You, you know what? Bye. Worry about yourself. You the one old. See you at the warehouse. - All right, good talk. And I'll, I'll give you the price later. It's gonna be negotiable, but, uh, it's gonna be good. (computer beeping) (cap clattering) (pills rattling) (cup thudding) (pills rattling) (container thudding) (switch clicking) - Quarantine, day 30. I'm trying to stay sober through all this, but I can't go to any NA meetings, and I can't even get in touch with my sponsor. My family has no idea I'm in NA, so I have no one to talk to. My brother is not making this any easier because he keeps sending me his wholesale shit for me to sell, so it's right in front of my fucking face. (powder rattling) (Lacy grunts) (packets thudding) (Lacy sighs) To make things worse, I'm stuck in this RV with Lick all day. He is making the deliveries for me, so that makes things easier, and I'm not completely alone. (Lacy sighs) (upbeat music) (Lick exhales) - Last delivery of the day. It's a de-Lick-very. - Ah. (laughs) - Whoa. Come on, baby. - Ooh. - What? - You reek. (Lick sniffing) - Ooh, yeah, that's a hard day's work. Your man's been working. (hands rasping and smacking) ♪ Give me some ♪ - Oh, God, no, uh-uh, no, no, no. - Come on. - It's not gonna happen. - Oh, come on. - No, it's really bad. I, and you know, I have that atrophy going on from the tamoxifen. It's just not gonna happen. - It's not atrophy. It's a trophy. (Lacy laughs) (laughs) Seems to me I took first prize, so I'm here to shine that baby up. ♪ Give me some ♪ - (laughing) No, seriously, no, uh-uh. - Come on. - If this is- It's right there. - gonna happen tonight, no, no, you're gonna have to go take a steaming hot shower and bring back some lube. - That, I can do. Yeah. ♪ Feeling it, gonna get ya some Lick, woo-hoo ♪ (Lacy laughs) (computer beeping) - Hello. - Hi, Rowdy. Hi, Rebel, how are my babies? - It's good. - Rowdy, are they, are they treating you well? - Yeah, even though I like it better at, at, at home 'cause I could play PlayStation all day. - (laughing) No, no, don't, don't say that now. (Rebel speaking gibberish) - What, what, what, what's Rebel doing? - [Rowdy] I don't know. - Rebel, do you like playing with your baby dolls? You do? - Rowdy, do they have a, a basketball hoop so you can do some practicing? - Yeah, I'm better than everybody. I run circles around all the other kids. (Rebel speaking gibberish) - I bet you are, buddy. I'm looking forward to a little one-on-one. We got some, we got some, a little one-on-one to do. - When will that be? - Well, I don't know, but we're gonna talk to our attorney friend, Davey, to see what our options are at this point, but we're gonna, we're gonna get y'all outta there real soon. (Rebel laughing) We love you, and y'all stay strong. We miss you. - Okay, love y'all, too. - Again, again, again, again. - Love y'all. - Bye. - Again, again, again, again. (computer beeping) - This is utter torture, Mike. We've gotta talk to Davy. - All right, one sec. (computer beeping) Okay. Ah, Davy, man, been trying to get in touch with ya. - Yeah, sorry about that. I've been in the hospital. I was diagnosed with coronavirus. They sent me home yesterday, so I think I'm doing better now, but, man, I still feel pretty bad. - Shit, man, is it as bad as they say? - It's the worst I've ever felt my entire life. And to exacerbate the situation, I have to stay in quarantine. If my condition gets any worse, I'm supposed to go back to the hospital. You just have to get through it alone. I mean, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. - Let me ask you something. (mellow music) Have you, have you ever done meth? You probably have 'cause it- - Come on, Mike. - 'Cause I read something. Uh- - Hey, Davey. - Yes, Ila, I got all of your 15 messages as soon as I left St. Mercy's Hospital. - I mean, I didn't mean, look, I'm, I'm sorry you're sick. I hope you get better soon. But- - And, and me too, man. And we all, we all do. And, and, and it'd be great if you get in touch with Lacy. I know she'd love to hear from you. - Oh, yeah, I'll reach out to her and let her know. - Okay, so you got all my messages, so, so what do you think? - Well, I'll be completely honest with you guys. There isn't much we can do (laughing) during the pandemic. I mean, the courts are dealing with so much other stuff right now that family law such as this is just being put on the back burner, I mean, especially that the kids are technically safe. - Yeah, but how does anyone know if they are safe? I mean, there are women right now, um, in abusive relationships who are forced to be in quarantine with their abusers, and this is not okay, and we just want our children home. - Well, even if this wasn't going on, you might not have 'em home with you yet anyway. They had visits set up with a foster family that hadn't been fully met yet. - Well, there's gotta be a way you can work around this, Davey. I mean, I mean, you know, people. I mean, come on. Is there a call you can make or something? - Yeah, I'll make some calls. I'll dig around. I got some contacts. I'll reach out to 'em for ya. But while I'm doing this, if you wouldn't mind, just try to keep your nose clean. - All right, will do. You know, speaking of nose, I mean, uh, the, the virus, you, you, you lose, did, uh, did I read where you lose your sense of smell? You lose your, your sense of taste? (Ila coughs) - I lost my smell and my taste. - Boy, how does that work when you're, like, stiffing a rail off a hooker's ass? - Oh, God. - I'll let you know, Mike. I'll let you know. - God in heaven, bye. - I, uh, I, I bet, I bet sometimes, man, that not having your sense of smell is a good thing, you know. I could tell ya some of the shit that Ila always serves me here in my room- - Okay, bye. - where, which is like, which is like a prison- - Bye. - by the way. Okay. All right, love you man. - Bye, guys. - Love you, man. Feel better, feel better. - Love you, talk soon. - Bye. (computer beeping) (door clattering) (hands thudding) - Nope, nothing's come in. - What the fuck? Rosie, when did you send the shipment? (gentle music) Rosie. - Maybe he's on mute. - No, no, he is a fucking mute. He's afraid to talk. (gentle music continues) (Rosie grunts) - I thought that I sent it when Tammy told me to last week, but then maybe it was only really just two days ago. - Dude, there's a tracking number. - It's fine, it's fine if it comes in a few days. I'll just call my clients and tell 'em it's in really high demand, and with all this shit that's going on, I mean, they'll understand. - Okay, I didn't send it at all, okay? I didn't send it. I'm fucking sorry. I had some people over last week, and when I went to bed, the fucking chicken feed was in the back seat of the Goddamn car. And then, the next morning it was gone. When I got up, it was fucking gone, and I didn't know how to tell you. And I'm sorry, Mike, and I'm fucking, I will make it up to you, man. I swear to God. - How? How are you gonna fucking make it up to me? You don't have any money. It's a fucking pandemic for fuck's sake. And I'm just trying to raise enough money to pay a fucking attorney to get my kids back. And you blow fucking five grand on smack? - Calm down, Mike. I mean, you can be pissed at Rosie all you want, but it's not gonna help our situation right now, so why don't you go through your inventory, see what you can get to Rose right now to get out to me? And you know what? I'm gonna go try to fucking meditate. - Yeah, you do that. You meditate. (birds chirping) (Ila exhaling) - Dagnabbit. (footsteps plodding) (door clattering) (mellow music) Michael. (hand knocking) Mike. Mike, I been trying to call you. Are you in there? (hand knocking) Michael. (Ila gasps) (hand knocking) That son of a bitch. (footsteps plodding) Michael, where are you? - What do you mean? I'm home. - No, you're not. I just knocked on your door, and you didn't respond. - Take, taking a dump. - Dammit, Mike, I called down at the corner store, and Marla told me you were just in there buying tequila. - Fucking snitch. - I'm not gonna argue about this, but you're back at day one on quarantine, and every time you do stupid shit, it starts over. Get your ass home. (phone veeps) (hand thudding) (Mike grunts) - Fuck. (energetic music) (door clattering) (Lacy moaning) (Lacy sobbing) - What? - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - It's okay. (Lacy sobbing) - No, you don't understand. Sex is, like, it's a favorite pastime of mine. It's, like, it's drugs to me. (Lacy sighs) - Yeah, I know. You've warned me about that before. (Lacy sobbing) - You know, when I was, uh, when I was diagnosed with cancer, all the specialists talked about all the steps we were gonna take to cure it. But they didn't talk about once I fought tooth and nail to live, how I was just gonna wanna die from all the side effects of everything. - You can't think like that. There's gotta be some... (notification chiming) - [Lacy] What's up? - Your brother is driving me mad. You know, he's out again today? And I thought, if I quarantined him in that back room, he'd start following the rules. (laughs) No such luck. I mean, who knows how many people he comes in contact with every day, and he's talking about going to a market. - Yeah, I've tried to talk sense into him. I think at least he wears a mask when he goes out now, except, (laughs) well, maybe not when he plays golf. He says that he stays at least 200 yards from everybody. He ain't wearing- - And he ain't wearing- - [Both] no sweaty mask if it ain't needed. - I have heard that a million times. (Lacy laughs) You know, it really would help us out if you were here inputting merchandise so maybe we could sell a little online. - (sighs) I know, but until that can happen, it'd be great if you sent me the correct inventory so I can input things the right way. (Lacy sighs) And you know, I still have another surgery I gotta go through, and I'm waiting on my specialist to tell me when it's safe to come to the hospital. - You know, um, we talked to Rebel and, and Rowdy the other day. They miss us all so much, but they seemed okay. And, um, and as you know, Ryder's in military school. Well, from, from what we hear, uh, he, he's remaining on campus, and he has his own room due to COVID. Uh, but that's all we, that's all we know so far. - I just miss them so much, and it's just scary for them to be away right now during all this. (Lacy sighs) But, Ila, did you hear a word I just said about myself? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, listen, honey, I've gotta go. Um, I'll talk to you later, okay? Love. (computer beeping) - Love you. (Mike clearing throat) Hey. - So, uh, you coming out here or what? - I, I already told you and Ila this. I can't come out there and be exposed to whatever you've gone and been exposed to. - No, I'm, hey, I'm, I'm playing by all the guidelines. Everything the White House is saying I'm doing. I'm, I'm wearing a mask and everything. And I don't even think that's in, in, even in the guidelines. - (laughing) That is bullshit. You think you're immune. - I am, but I'm still gonna put extra safe for when you come. - Hmm. Look, I really wanna see y'all, and I'm even worried about mom. I mean, is Ila even feeding her? - I think so. I think, I think now that she found the good book, she's, how do I want to say this, she's more, yeah, has, has more, uh... - Humanity? - Yeah, that's it. That's it. But I, but the reason I called is because, uh, I, I wanted to, I wanted to propose something to ya. I, I'm thinking, I think, we'll, eventually we'll get the money back that Rosie lost, but until then, I was thinking maybe we could try to do business with, uh, with, uh, Jabo's old friend, uh, Stank, you know, and, and, and, uh, hopefully do a little moonshine business. And I know you know him well, and I'm sure he's probably looking for anything to do right now. - All right, yeah, I can give him a call. Let's, uh- - Cool. - try to get him on the chat, one sec. - Cool. (mellow music) - Hey, Stank, how are ya? - Hey, y'all, I reckon I'm doing all right, a little lonely since old Jabo's not around, though. And ain't this shit crazy? Good Lord, I can't even find no damn toilet paper. Had to go to three different stores and get that cheap kind that you have to wad up, or your finger'll go through, shit. - (laughing) What is that about? I don't know what toilet paper's gonna do to help anybody. - I know what you mean. My wife has me quarantined in a separate part of my own house. I haven't even seen her in, like, a month. (Stank and Lacy laughing) - In your own damn house. Well, do you got toilet paper to wipe your ass? 'Cause I got (laughing) a couple extra rolls if you need 'em. - I might need it. (Stank laughing) - So, look, uh, what y'all hollering at me about? - Well, we got a proposition for ya. - Well. You know me, I'm all damn ears all the time if it, if, if it's got anything to do with money and, uh, you know, that other thing. - It definitely has something to do with money. And it's what we know you do best, which is? - Moonshine. - Moonshine. - We're back in business. (hands smacking) (computer beeping) - What's up? (quirky music) - Hey, just make sure you know the drop-off point once you get the moonshine from Stank. - Yeah, all groovy. - All right, well, once you drop it, take some sanitizer, okay? - Sanitizer, I like it. - All right, well, be careful. - How you spell sanitizer? - Dude, seriously? (computer beeping) God, I hope he doesn't get caught. We're only supposed to be going out for essentials right now, and a guy riding down the road with a truck full of milk jugs might look suspicious. - Yeah, but right now is maybe the perfect time to pull off some just like this. - You've been talking to my brother too much. (Lacy sighs) I really need to get in touch with my NA sponsor and soon. (card thudding) (Lacy sniffing) (Lacy grunting) (energetic music) (vocalist singing death metal indistinctly) (Lacy sobbing) (phone ringing) (Lacy exhales) (phone ringing) - [Cory] Hey, what's up girl? - Hey, Cory, I know it's been a while, but do you have time for a video chat? - [Cory] Of course, I do. Everything okay? - Uh, it's been a little tough, so. - [Cory] Okay, all right, yeah. Um, I'll jump on right now? - Okay, cool, thanks. - All right, bye, yeah, see ya. (computer beeping) Okay, so what's going on with you? - Well, I've been trying to get in touch with my sponsor, but I haven't been able to, and I don't, I don't know if he's sick. I, I hope he's not. It's just (sighs) we were roommates, so I figured maybe we, you could chat with me, or maybe you have a sponsor there I could chat with. - Yeah, girl, I'll be your last resort. Come on. What you got? - I've been doing so good. I've been clean since I was diagnosed, but last night, I fell off. (Cory sighs) - Okay. Um, well, I would say to get to a meeting, of course, but in your instance, (hands thudding) uh, that, I don't really think that would be smart. Um, hmm. (clicks tongue) You know, I think I know of a meeting. They do that, uh, online chat thing, the login stuff. - Yeah. - You could go that route maybe? - Yeah, I would totally do that. I just don't know how much longer I can take this, being stuck here, and my brother has me dealing for him again, so- - What? - I'm around it all the time. - Are you for real? Okay, all right. Um, all right, let me get off of here. Let me find that number for you, and, um- - Cool, thanks. - Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll call you right back, okay? It's good seeing you. I miss you. - I miss you, too. - All right, I'll talk to you soon, okay? - All right. - All right, bye, girl. (computer beeping) - Hey. (mellow music) - Hey, hey, Tammy. Hey, I'm, I was also looking for Keisha. Do you see her? Do you see Keisha on the screen? Oh. - Hey, Miss Ila. Hey, Tammy Jo. - Hey, y'all. - Hey, Keisha. - Y'all, um, I, I, I, so Lacy is real busy with Mike right now, um, trying to get some cash flow, and I was wondering if y'all would help me with my inventory because Lacy says she needs that before she can input products on my website. - Yeah, we should be able to do that. - So, you just want us to go down to the warehouse and count each item for you? - Yes, and, and just separate them, uh, by style, color, and size. - Yeah, we'll be down there repackaging for Mike, so might as well do that, too. - Oh, good. Okay, all right. Well, y'all be, y'all be careful, you know. Wear your masks, six feet and all that if you don't mind. - Sure. Uh, hey, Tammy Jo can- - Okay. - can, can you hang on- - Thank you. - for a second? I got something to say to you real quick. - Bye. (mellow music continues) - Yeah, Keisha, you know people are getting paid more for unemployment right now for doing nothing? - Oh, what in the hell is her lazy ass doing? - Y'all, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm still on the call. - Uh, oh, oh, oh, we were just talking about my auntie who works at the warehouse down there next to you. Uh, uh, bye. Thank you for the work. - Okay, bye. (computer beeping) - Shit. Call me. ♪ Please get me drunk again ♪ (Ila exhaling) - Hey, Mike, um, I got, uh, Tammy Jo and Keisha to get my inventory so I can give it to Lacy. - Okay. So, basically, you have nothing to do as usual. - (scoffs) Yes, I delegate. - You know, we hardly have any money right now for you to be just throwing it away on something you should be doing yourself. - This is why I don't tell you shit. - Are you smoking? ♪ I'm tired of the constant ♪ - No, I'm doing my Bible study. - Yeah, you are. You're smoking, and you're drinking, too, aren't you? - No, this is sparkling juice. - Oh, yeah, nice try. (plastic rustling) I know your porch activities. - Bye. (computer beeping) ♪ Kids today ♪ (mellow guitar music) - Hey, man, what's up? - I couldn't get up with Skank today. - Why? - 'Cause I got over there, and there was fucking coppers lined up from here to fucking Tuesday. - Shit, man, that is not good. We were gonna use that fucking money for the attorney. The kids have been going away from home for way too long. We need them back. - Look, I could try again in a few days. I just think we ought to let cool, just let it cool off, let things cool down. That's all I'm saying. - Just fucking keep me updated. (computer beeping) (mellow guitar music continues) (notification chiming) (phone clanking) (Lacy sighs) Can you stop playing that thing for a minute? I need to have a conversation in peace. - Go in the bedroom. - That is not a soundproof door. I can still hear that dad-blasted thing. - I'm onto something really good here. I can't really stop. (mellow guitar music continues) - Have you seen this water? - Yeah, I cleaned some up earlier with my towel. I left it in the back there. - You didn't think to tell me? - Figured it was the shower or something. I didn't think anything of it. (mellow guitar music continues) - Where is this coming from? (door clattering) - I don't know, the slide maybe? It rained pretty hard earlier. (Lacy sighs) - Just what I need. (door clattering) I don't have any money. (Lacy sighs) How am I gonna get this fixed? (phone ringing) I can't even let anybody inside here to look at the damn thing. (phone ringing) (door clattering) (mellow music continues) Just what I need. Hey, what's up over there? How, hang on, hey, I dropped my phone. (phone clanking) (Lacy exhales) Hey, what's up? - I've been drinking a lot of tequila. (Lacy laughs) - Yeah, that too. But I got a damn leak in my RV. - You know that's not a house, right? - Well, it's mine at the moment. - Hey, I look better naked. (Lacy laughs) - Is that what they tell you? - And on that note, goodbye. - Wait, wait, I need to tell you what's going on with Stank's deal. (mellow guitar music continues) Fucking fuck. Quarantine, day 45, people are starting to protest. Even people in my family are being ridiculous. After having Mike in quarantine, Ila now wants to go visit her mom. (shaver buzzing) Supposedly, God will save us. - All right, now take your time back there, Fantastic Sam. Just follow the line and please don't cut the long stuff. - Um. (mellow music) - Um, what? - You have a really bad bald spot. - Why the fuck is there a bald, why did you change the setting? - No, I didn't change the setting. I remember from last time. - Yeah. - I didn't touch it. - No, yeah, you did because there wouldn't be a bald spot unless you changed the setting. - No, I didn't, but it looks really bad. - Yeah, no shit. Have you ever seen a good-looking bald spot? - I've seen good-looking bald men. - Bald spot, it's different. - I can't fix that. (notification chiming) Oh, hang on. I gotta take this. - Hang on what? - It's that guy you're supposed to deliver to tonight. (Lick scoffs) I wanna see if he can video chat so I can get a better feel for him. - What about my hair? (Lacy laughs) - It's not gonna get any worse. - Yeah, you're probably right about that. Ask him if he's got a fucking hat for me to use since I'm gonna have to wear one for about a month. (notification chiming) Dammit. (notification chiming) (computer beeping) - Hey, Pepperoni, I have a few questions for you. - Fuck, don't call me Pepperoni, please. Your brother's been calling me that since second grade. You can call me Peppy for short. - Oh, okay, all right. - Listen, I had a couple questions, too. Uh, you go first. Go ahead. - Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no. You go, you go first. - Are you sure? All right, well, I was just wondering, just, I'm, listen, I'm just throwing this out there, but would you consider maybe, uh, bartering? Because I got a line on quite a few things right now, and I can hook you up. - Uh, what do you, what do you mean by that? - Well, I don't know. Let's say you need, uh, toilet paper, all right? Well, I got a line on toilet paper, right? You see what that is? You know what that is? That's two-ply, one-ply, two-ply. Right there, baby, that's the big daddy. That's three-ply toilet paper. You can't even get napkins right now. I got three-ply toilet paper in exchange for some glass. I got cases of that shit. You need masks, surgical masks, uh, gloves. I got Lysol. That's real, legit Lysol, cleanser, uh, paper towels, uh, food. You want some food? I got food. Anything you need, I got. I'm Italian, okay? I got 30 days of pasta- - Yeah, no. - in my garage at all times. - No, no. Okay, I, I get it. - It ain't never gonna go bad. - I get it, but no, no, we don't barter. We only deal in cash. So, is that, is that gonna work for you? - Yeah, (laughing) hey, hey, cash works for me. - Well, that, that's great because here's the deal. At 6:30, my guy Lick's gonna come over there, and he's gonna grab the cash that you've put under your doormat, and then he's gonna exchange it for the product. - All right, 6:30. You want me to lick? What do you want me to lick? (mellow guitar music) - Ila, I don't think it's a good idea. (Ila sighs) - I can't sit here another day not doing anything. I mean, if we're supposed to live, we're supposed to live. - What you're talking about doing is gonna cause another spike. I mean, all this quarantining you've been doing is just gonna go down the toilet if you go visit your family and your mama. - Mom's got to help me with my finances and, and taxes. - (laughing) She can do that over the phone. - I've gotta go. - And, and what, what's Mike gonna think after you've had him quarantining all this time, and you go and expose yourself and our mama (Ila sighs) to, to new people? - He'll be okay. It'll be fine. - How is mom, by the way? - Oh, she's good. She's good. She just watches her stories, and I keep her stocked up on, on her Diet Pepsi and shrimp. (mellow guitar music continues) - Can I just get a glimpse at her? I haven't seen her in so long. - Yeah, yeah, one second, hold on. (footsteps plodding) Yeah, here she is. (birds chirping) (Lacy laughs) - How does one person eat that much shrimp? - I do not know. I mean, consuming that much of one thing, it can't be good. - Especially washing it down with Diet Pepsi. (mellow guitar music continues) All right, well, I guess I'll talk to you later. But you know, Ila, I know that I fuck up a lot, but just think about what I said. Maybe ask, uh, Matthew or Davey about it. - Love you. - Love you, too. (computer beeping) - So, uh, what's this I hear about you going to visit your mama? - I need help with my books. - That's bullshit. You got Keisha, you got Tammy, you got Lacy doing the bulk of your work, so you can't do your own fucking books? - No, I don't wanna hear anything about it. Mom doesn't have any symptoms, and I'm not putting anybody at risk by going to see her. - Bullshit again. Your mama works at a fucking hospital. She goes in, every day she's at risk. - No, what, what, what about you? You play golf and go running at the park every day. You see the people who work for you every day. - It's different. Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm keeping the, doing the distance thing. I'm wearing a mask. - (laughing) Right. - You know what? I want my fucking kids back, and what we're doing right now is bad. It's, it's, it makes us look not responsible. (Ila sighs) So, you know what? I'm gonna, (clears throat) I'm gonna add David to this call. How 'bout that? - Oh, sure, add Davey to the call. - Oh, sure, I will. (computer beeping) - Hey, Mike, what's going on? - Ila, Ila wants to go see her mom, which I think is a bad idea. What do you think? - Hey, don't lead him. Davey, why would it be a bad idea? - Well, has your mom been in quarantine? - No, but she doesn't have any symptoms. - You could still be asymptomatic and carry the virus around. I mean, I'm living proof of that. I thought I was fine before showing any symptoms. You don't want any of this, Ila. I'm still not over it. - Well, I'm sure I'm okay because I've been inside for almost a month. - But your mama hasn't, and that's not gonna do me or Matthew any favors. Just do me a favor. Be patient a little longer. - Thank you, Davey, thank you. Hey, by the way, have you heard anything from Matthew or from the, one of the judges? - No, I'm hoping they'll send me something later this week. I mean, they always wanna keep children with their parents, so we'll have to wait and see. - Yeah, well, I was thinking, you know, this, this whole pandemic has, like, clogged up the fucking system, so maybe, maybe after it's all over, they'll, they'll just wipe our slate clean. - I don't know about that slate. It's pretty good size, but we'll see what happens. I'll also see if we can get another call set up with you and the kids. - Thanks, Davey, for that. - Yeah, no problem. We'll talk to you soon. - All right, later. - Okay. - See ya. - Bye. Michael. (Lacy breathing heavily) - Well, it's a hell of a note to finally be over the big C with only reconstruction left to go to then be shut off from the world to a global pandemic. - Where you been, man? My sister called here last night. - Oh, shit, man. What'd you tell her? - What I told her was she knows you haven't been rehabbing this house with me this past month. She knows that. - No, no, no. - You realize through something like this how selfish people can really be. I wish Mike and Ila would pay attention. And why is it that those elected officials, the ones who have accents like me, sound so fucking stupid? I mean, think about it. If one person goes out who's infected, they infect three more people. And then those three people go out, and they infect three more people. And then those lucky few who have much lower immune systems, they get infected, and it just keeps going. Do the math, people. (Lacy sighs) - Dude, you gotta help me out, man. You know Shonda better than anyone. You know how she works. Like, which, what's her next move? What's, what's she planning? What am I supposed to do? (dramatic music) - This is the last time I'm helping you out. She's my sister. - Yeah, I know. All right, man, just help me. - Yeah, okay, look, look. She said she was gonna turn on some tracker on your, your phone, or computer, or something. I don't know, some Family 360 app. - Oh, fuck me, man. Dude, Lacy's going to kill me. - Whatever, man, I gotta, look, I can't help you out no more. - Ah, shit. - I gotta finish up this house. I ain't sharing the money. - And as much as I like to try to talk sense into Mike and Ila, I'm about to feed Lick to the damn gators. His fucking PlayStation-, guitar-playing, deadbeat ass is driving me up the damn wall. (mellow music) (door clattering) - I'm not sharing the money. - Oh, shit. Hey, man, I gotta let you go, bro. I'll talk to you later, all right? - [Raymond] I'm not going to share the money. - Hello? Hello? - Hey, Matty. - No, it's Matt. - Hi, Matthew. - Hey, hi, how are you guys holding up? - Well, I'm okay. - I'm okay. - Um, how's it going there? - It's all right. I've been feeling a little worse for wear. It, it may be this, um, circulated air. - Yeah, vitamin D is good for the soul. That's why I always try to get out, and play golf, and go to the park. - Don't get me started, Mike. Um, okay, Matthew, have you heard back from Davey? Are, are we gonna have a, another chance for another chat with the kids? - I've talked with Davy. Um, however, there is something we need to discuss. Now, don't panic, but Rowdy ran away from his foster family today. - What? - You've been on the phone with us for a full minute, and, and you're, you're telling us this now? That should've been the first thing outta your mouth. - Wait, our baby is out there alone during a pandemic? - Do you know where he might've gone? - Yeah, we taught him how to read the sun, you know, like Crocodile Dundee, so he's probably on his way home. Fuck no. We have no idea where he is. - Well, look, don't worry. We've, we've contacted Missing Persons. Uh, I, I've got a private investigator involved. We, we've talked with law enforcement. If you can tell some of his friends and, and see if they might know, it, it, it, it might help us find him. We're gonna find him. - Okay, we, we will. - Oh, uh, just a friendly reminder. You've burned through your retainer with me. I need it replenished. - Yeah, I'll see what I can do. - 'Kay, please let us know as soon as you hear anything. - Okay. - Oh, my God. - Matty, Matty. (Shonda laughs) - Oh, my God, so true, ah. - Oh, I'm spilling stuff all over myself out that. - Ah, coffee. - And then (Lacy laughs) - hand sanitizers, and you don't have any napkins. - Who you talking to? - Fucking hell has happened? - Shonda. - It's on the corner. - Your wife. (coffee sputtering) (dramatic music) - Oh, shit. - We've been chatting for the last half hour or so. Uh, uh, what were you thinking leaving this beautiful soul? - Tell her I'm not here. (Lacy laughs) - Is that Lick? - Yeah, he, he says he's not here. (energetic music) - [Lick] I just said tell her I'm not here. Goddamn it. - I, I can hear you, honey. I can hear you. Uh, listen, listen, Lick, uh, even though you're not there, you're not here either. (Lacy laughs) You need to come home now. - You only want me there to help you finish rehabbing these houses as a handyman to just kick me around. Like, you didn't even know I was gone for an entire month until you found out the house Raymond's working on wasn't even finished yet. And I told you to tell her I'm not even here. - It's funny you should mention Ray, my brother, who is the one that had to tell me that you've been messaging me for weeks, talking about progress, talking about you're getting this done, talking this and that. So, Raymond says all of that, (clicks tongue) oh, it was a lie. Why have I been sending you money, Lick? - Well, I figure you just owe it to me anyway for all these houses I've rehabbed for you over the years. - That's not how this works, okay? I know where you are. Miss Lacy has told me that I should not come drive down there, and I'm gonna respect that wish because she has a weak immune system, and I'm not a monster. But this ain't gonna last forever. Do not press your luck. (Lick sighs) (energetic music continues) - Yes, I, I, I really appreciate that, Shonda. And I do look forward to getting together when all this is shit over. But right now, I'm gonna let you two hash this out. - Getting together? - Okay. - Yeah. - You are lovely. You're a queen. Don't let this man rub off on you. - What's happening? (Lacy laughs) - Let's talk soon, you and me, 'kay? - [Shonda] Mm-hmm. - What the fuck? Why, why do you even need me there working right now anyway? No one's buying houses. You can't buy a house if you have no money. No one's making any money. - You're making money. I'm spending money on you. (energetic music continues) - Quit telling her you're sending me money. - Now, you're keeping secrets from two people? - You know, Lacy respects me as me, the artist, and she treats me like that. I'm not giving that up. I'm not ready. - You need to get over yourself. - I'm fucking just, stay on, okay, stay on the Goddamn stump. Fucking stay on the Goddamn stump. Just (grunts), (camera clattering) ah, fucking fuck this. Fuck, okay, oh, okay, got it, got it, okay, okay. Hey, man, it's too Goddamn short. Hey, everybody, this is your old pal. Oh, fuck. Um, hey, um, uh, hey, every, (sighs) say it. Just say the words. Just say it right. Okay, uh, what the fuck? Um, uh, uh. (lips flapping) (footsteps plodding) Oh, hey, I didn't see you there. And, um, uh, hey, every, I didn't even get a Goddamn tripod. Mm, something's cooking up here. Speaking of cooking, boy, have we cooking up a deal for you. Rosie, that's me, your old pal from Mike Hilgreen's FU Inc. (Lacy laughing) - (laughing) Oh. Oh, Mike's gonna kill him. - [Rosie] Sent off of all of our- - [Lick] Huh, who? - [Rosie] Sale. You know what I mean. - (laughing) Oh. Oh, you gotta come over here. You gotta come look. - [Rosie] Dot com. - Rosie's fucked. - [Rosie] Ask for the pre-sale special. (computer beeping) (funky music) (beer sloshing) - [Mike] What the fuck were you thinking, man? - I was taking initiative. - No, no, no, you weren't, and shut the fuck up. I'm, I'm gonna tell you what you were thinking, absolutely nothing, all right? We're gonna watch the video together, and I want you to tell me just what might be wrong with this, all right? - All right. Rosie, that's me, your old pal from Mike Hilgreen's FU Inc. That's right. This week, we're having a pre-sale special, 50% off of all of our wholesale, if you know what I mean. Tell 'em Rosie sent ya. Ask for the pre-sale special. (tongs clanging) (laughing) I gotta get back to my cooking. But hurry 'cause this won't last long. Hell, yeah. (laughing) - Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing? You don't see, you don't see nothing wrong with that? - I don't see Goddamn thing wrong with that. I mean- - You gave out my personal information, you fucking turtle brain. All right, you gotta take that shit down right now. - I ain't got- - People are starting to contact me. People are contacting me. - Already? People are contacting you already? I just uploaded that shit. Hell, yeah, cha-ching, bank- - Not- - baby, whoo. - Shut the fuck up. That's, that's my, that's my business information to sell illegal substances, which we don't even have. (Rosie laughing) - Well, it don't, we going get 'em. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. - You're a fucking moron. Take that shit down. - You got to chill, man. This shit is going to work out like the fucking bomb, man. The Inter-Goddamn-net is where it's at. Everybody's on it. Hell, I mean, we ought to get, like, one of them Goddamn Instagrams. - Yeah, let me give you my social security. What, what, what, what you, what else do you need in terms of information to get me fucking put in jail? I don't know. Lemme help me help you out. - I don't know why you're getting so mad, man. I mean, this is a- - Why, why, 'cause you're a fucking idiot. - It's a good business model. People go on the Internet, and then they contact you. How they gonna trace that shit? - You don't, how do they (laughing) trace that shit? 'Cause you gave 'em my personal information. - Yeah, but it, does, it gets encrypted or some shit, you know, like after the fact. - It's not encrypted. It's not encrypted when you put it fucking right on there. How do you, how, what, do you even know what encrypted means? - How else are they supposed to contact us if your information ain't on there? I mean, you know what I mean? You can't just sell, say you got drugs, and then people'll be like, "Where's the drugs?" And you're like, "Oh, evaporate," and they don't, like, you don't, if you don't tell 'em where you are and how to get to it, then how the fuck are they going, you're just gonna have 'em just be like, "I want some drugs, but I don't, I don't know where to go"? - You know, your brain evaporated, and that's the problem. You, you, your, you have fucking no brain in your head at all. - Well, that's hurtful. - At all. - That's hurtful. It's hurtful when you're like this. It's hurtful. - Idiot. (computer beeping) - Fucking Shonda, man. She's up my ass bugging me again. - You married her for a reason. Maybe you should think about that. - I have thought about it plenty, and I'm happy here. Never once has she ever taken me seriously as an artist. - Well, you're creative, and she's not. What's new? The problem started when you went to work for her. And that, that's on you. - I don't know, maybe. - No, dude, that makes sense. And I'm the queen of fucking shit up, so you should take my advice. - I take my own advice 'cause I gave myself some advice, and as soon as I took that advice, which was take some time out for myself to be me, an artist, as soon as I started doing that, listening to myself, dude, I've crushed literally every single song I've written since, every one, hit after hit after hit. (fingers snapping) So good AF. Check- - Are you listening to these songs? (Lick scoffs) - Check these shits out if you don't even believe it. You'll see. (footsteps plodding) (door clattering) (actors chattering indistinctly) Hey, Rumplefuckstick, what, what are you waiting for? Come on. (actors chattering indistinctly) (door clattering) Fuck took you so long? - Okay. (phone clanking) - 'Kay. Now, come here. Sit down right there. Since you haven't been paying attention to the fucking hit songwriting that's been going on in your rolling house here- - Mm-hmm. - I'm just gonna show you with a hot little number entitled "Lacy Bracy Heart." Goes a little something like this. (romantic guitar music) ♪ I'm smitty, I'm smitty, I'm smitten with you ♪ ♪ I'm smitty, I'm smitty, smit, smit, smitten with you ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ You came into my life at just the right time ♪ ♪ I was going off the rails ♪ ♪ But you put the rails around my waist ♪ ♪ And pushed the borderline ♪ ♪ Down, down, down ♪ ♪ Now, we're dancing in the park together ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ You don't like it? You fucking don't like it. (Lacy clears throat) We were outside all day. My voice usually sounds better, but it's, it's dry, and I'm cracky, and I broke my tuner earlier, so my guitar's a little outta whack. And I've been fucking hammered for six straight days. I'm dehydrated and dry. How do you think you would sound? - Look, look, I didn't, I didn't say it didn't like it. - You didn't have to say it. I could see it on your face. And apparently, I also need to tell you that you didn't marry a fucking accountant. I'm a Goddamn metal master. - Look, I know you're not an accountant. (Lacy laughing) - What's so fucking funny? What's- - Just (laughs)- - You don't laugh at the fucking Rolling Stones when they write "Maggie May." - I just wonder, do you think that we're married? Because you already have a wife. - So? It's called common room marriage, dummy. When you live in the same place for, with someone for seven days, you're married. - It's common law marriage, and it's seven years. Fucking idiot. - Fucking fuck this. Fuck this bullshit. (guitar clattering) Waste my fucking hits. That was gonna be our fucking wedding song. - You're already married, you fuck. - You, uh, you ready to add him now? - Yes. (gentle music) Oh, my goodness, we are so lucky they found him. I still can't believe he ran away. He's only eight. (Ila sighs) Our babies shouldn't be going through anything like this. - I know. We'll get him back soon. All right, let me, let me try to add him. - Hey. - Hi, babies. - Hey. - Hey. - How's my, how's my little man and my baby girl? - Good. - Oh, Rebel, do you have your little puppy dog with you? Where is it? - It's on the floor. - Oh, gosh, better get it. - On the floor? - Oh, it's so sweet. - Aw. - Oh. - You know, son, you had us worried. You know, you can't, ya, something bad could happen to ya. - I know. I'm sorry. I promise I won't do it again. - We want you to come home. We're working really hard to make that happen. But you gotta promise not to run away again, son. (Rebel laughing) - I won't. - 'Kay. - We love y'all. You know that right? We love y'all. - Love y'all so much. - We're gonna chat soon. - All right. - Chat soon. - Bye. - Bye. (lips smacking) - Love y'all. - Love you, too, bye. (hand knocking) - Ila, what the hell's going on? - What do you need? - Uh, we're chatting right now. Come on. - Oh, God. (upbeat music) Oh, love. (computer beeping) - Why can't I open my door? - Michael, that door has been locked for over a month. Have you lost your mind? - You know what I'm talking about, the door to the outside, to the outside world. It's barred shut. - Oh, that door. Well, if you had been following the rules the way you're making me do by not going to see my mom, you wouldn't have even noticed. - It's different, and you know it. Come open the door. - That I cannot do, negative. See, I had Rosie come over and board it up while you were in the shower. - How am I supposed to get takeout? - I'll slide it under your door. - How am I supposed to do my deliveries? - You shouldn't be going anywhere. Have Casey, Lacy, Rosie, Tammy Jo, or Keisha do it. - How am I supposed to take out the trash? (upbeat music continues) - Now, that I had not thought of. Hmm. (computer beeping) (upbeat music continues) (lighter clicking) (birds chirping) (computer beeping) - Hey, girl. You gonna be able to come over here and get this fine whiskey, (sniffing) uh, before I drink it all up? - We've been trying to do just that. But when Rosie rode over that way, he said that your road was ate up by cops. - Yeah, oh, hell, yeah, crazy times right now all over the damn place. Look, me and the chief, we go way back, played football together. And every now and then, I give him a little white, so we getting around them coppers, it ain't no thing. - (laughs) Well- - Trust me. (Stank laughing) - Dang it, Stank, I wish I'da known that two weeks ago. I'll call Rosie and tell him to get his ass back over there. (phone ringing) - Hang on. Hello, Stanky Stanks. (Lacy laughing) Hell, no, I can't. I'm in a chat meeting. On the Internet. No, hell, no, I'll call you when it's over, all right? All right, bye-bye. (phone clanking) But getting back to it, look. Lemme tell you something. Hanging around Jabo, hell, he taught me a lot, a hell of a lot, and making nice to the chief was one of the number one damn lessons he taught me. He did. Another thing he said was, "It'll creep up on ya." It'll creep up on ya? The hell? But he damn right, you know, so when y'all out there selling to folks, you gotta tell 'em and tell 'em one, two, three, four, five times. It'll creep up on ya. - Man, I don't think that you paid much attention to the creeping part. I was there that day that you ran right into that damn tree. - (laughing) Oh, hell. That was just a little old scratchy scratch, nothing to it. (glass thudding) - No, I remember when Jabo said, "A taste is a taste, Stank." - "A taste is a taste, Stank." (Stank laughing) - Lord have mercy. I sure do miss old Jabo, hot tamale. - Yeah, I do, too. (mellow music) Nobody else like him in the world. Hey, Rose, I talked to Stank, and he said you're in the clear to pick up the product. And don't worry if you see Christmas lights 'cause they're up all year round, and they got 'em in the pocket. Bye. (phone clanking) (computer beeping) Hey, oh, my God, I miss you. - Damn, girl, you look haggard. Thought I was having a tough day. - Oh, yeah, um, my makeup artist and hairstylist aren't making house calls, so this is what you get. (Mike laughs) - Yeah, well it's, it's worse than that. You, you look pale. You look paler than pale, like ghostly pale. You need to, you need to get out in the air, get out in the sun. Get you one of these masks. Makes you look like the Old West. Get you (laughing) one like this one, too, that says, "Fuck it. Fuck the phone company. Fuck pay TV. Fuck obscenity." - No, that's not even up to regulations. Doesn't do anything for you. - I'm not wearing it for regulations. All right, so what's up? - Well, uh, I think we'll have some money for Matthew by the end of next week. - That's cool. I think I can hold off old Matty till the end of the week. What about deliveries? - I don't know about Rose and Birdie, but I'm running low. - Ila is fucking working against me. She boarded the door. She boarded my escape door. I can't get outta the house. Thinking about just busting this door. That'll serve her right. - Well, maybe if you lay off the tequila, you might think of something. - Bingo. (fingers tapping) (funky music) (tissues rustling) - Ah, holy fuck. - Shit. - Is that what you're into? - No, I was just looking at it, checking- - You're just checking it out? Who just checks that out that's not into it? Fucking sicko. I'm into a lot of stuff, but that's past the point of pushing the boundaries. - Just, just experimentation. I mean, you don't have to judge me so hard. - Well, it was a group of guys under a glass coffee table wearing clear goggles so a girl could stand on top of it, pop a squat, and shit in their faces so they could jack off. Man, that's fucking nasty. - Maybe to you, but- - Okay. - There's obviously a lot of people who are into it. It's there. - No. No, you can leave now. - Leave? Where am I supposed to go? It's a fucking pandemic outside. I can't go. - Yes, I could see where a guy like you would be so worried. - What do you mean a guy like me? What did I do? - A guy like you who participates in sexcapades where girls' feces could splatter in his mouth. God, I've kissed that mouth. - [Lick] God, whatever. - Ugh. - I'm gonna go sleep on the couch, but I'm not leaving. I can't go anywhere. It's a fucking pandemic. (footsteps plodding) That's not even how you spread it. (Lacy retching) (sirens wailing) (plastic rustling) (paper rustling) (upbeat music) (club thudding) (clubs clanging) (bag thudding) (computer beeping) (laid-back music) - Hey. - I thought you quit smoking. - Oh, I did. I thought you quit doing drugs. - I did. This is just weed. It don't count. - Oh. - Although I did spiral a few days ago. How are Mike and the kids? - (laughs) Well, I had Rosie come board up the outside door last week so Mike couldn't go anywhere, and he has been in full-on freakout mode. (Lacy laughs) - I fucking bet. Man, y'all give each other hell. - Yeah, I had Rosie come take the boards off while Mike was in the shower yesterday. He doesn't know it yet. (notifications chiming) Oh, look, here he is. Hey. Hey, Lacy, I gotta, I gotta call you back. Michael's sick. (footsteps plodding) - Sick? Sick how? Ila. - Mike. Mike, I got your message. What do you mean you're sick? - It usually means one thing. I mean, I guess when the kids say it, maybe it means another, but you know what I mean. - How bad is it, like, scale of one to 10? - Real bad. - You sound awful. - It's all your fault. You know, if you, if you hadn't locked me in my room like a prison with recirculated air, not letting me take the trash out, it's, it's, I got the virus probably. - No, I had those boards taken off yesterday. You hadn't been in any of that long. - You caged me in. It's your fault. - Okay, let's not point fingers. You need to call the hospital. I'm gonna call Lacy and have her get in touch with the attorney to set up another chat with the kids in case you have to go into the hospital. Shit. - Okay, will do. Ila, just keep me updated. (hand knocking) (water pattering) (Mike coughing) - Mike, what's going on? (phone ringing) Mike, answer me. (keys jangling) Shit. - Yeah. (door clattering) (dramatic music) (water pattering) (mellow guitar music) - Davey, can you call me? (notification chiming) - Hey, Lace, I ain't been able to get over to Stank's yet. Okay, I'm sorry, but just, you know, life happens, and I just couldn't get over there, and now I got a new plan. I got a whole new plan, so don't worry. I got this under control. You know how, like, these days everybody's wearing a mask right now 'cause of this candemic? I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna take advantage of that 'cause don't nobody know who anybody is, right? Right, partner? (Rosie laughing) Later. (mellow guitar music continues) - What the fuck does that mean? (headset clattering) Not today. - Ow. Don't fucking snatch my shit like that. Are you fucked? God, what's wrong with you? - Dammit, Lick, not today. I can't deal with this. (sighs) Mike is sick. (Lacy sighs) He wants to talk to his kids. We haven't made any money, and who the fuck knows what Rosie's up to? - What the fuck does any of that have to do with me? - You just need to leave. I'm, you already have a wife. You like shit in your face. And if you go back to work for your wife, you'll have money rolling in so that you can make your own records. - I don't like it. I was just looking at it, and I already told you I don't wanna go anywhere. I love you. I'm staying. - Lick, I'm not in a place to have a relationship right now. I told you that from the beginning. I'm still not out of the woods with my procedures, and (sighs) that slip-up the other night. I need to make sure it wasn't a full-on relapse. - Whatever, none of that even matters. You're just saying this because you gotta have your open relationship thing all the time. And now that maybe we're supposed to go outside, it's an easy way to get me outta your hair. Move on to the next one. - Well, if that's the case, if that's the case, then that's the case. Either way, you gotta leave. - You know what? If that's what you really want. (footsteps plodding) (notifications chiming) (headset clattering) (Lacy sighs) Uh-uh. (dramatic music) I'm not going anywhere. - Being a hostage is nothing new to me. It's almost a welcome stranger in my life from family members to this virus and intimate relationships more times than I care to remember. Lick broke down and dropped the gun when I held up these. Yes, that's exactly what you think they are. (baby crying) (Lacy laughs) Looks like Lick, Shonda, and I'll be raising a hellion of our own. (baby crying) And speaking of hellions, looks like the state dropped the ball since Rowdy, Ryder, and Rebel are raising hell back at home. - Ow. - Oh, and don't worry about their health because Mike didn't actually have COVID. He still believes he's immune. (baby crying) - You know, I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of the viruses were psychopathic or psychosomatic, whatever that word is, psychosemetic. Man, I'm, I'm not saying, listen, the virus existed. I just think a lot of people, it was psychosemetic. That's what took 'em to the hospital. And, uh, I think mine, I mean, I think mine was psychosemetic, psychopathic. Watch this pass. I blame Dr. Anthony Fauci for virtually everything. I call him the, let's just say the Bernie Madoff of epidemiology. Why? Because he's misled us all the way through this thing, okay? So, you know, (diners chattering indistinctly) yeah, did I get sick? Yeah. Did it have to do with COVID-19? No, because I had antibodies, the whole deal. And, and, and nobody gets credit for that. I didn't get credit for it. Nobody does because that's his agenda and still is. (diners chattering indistinctly) And mark these words. I mean, I'm going back to the 1918 influenza. I'm going back to the Hong Kong flu of 1969, which by the way, 100,000 people died, and you know what we did for that? You know what we did? We had Woodstock. (Ila sighs) - Okay. (computer beeping) - Ila, it's been a while. - Alexandra, are, do you have pants on? Are you still in bed? - What? - Nothing, oh, hey, is your sister, Tori, around? - (laughs) I haven't spoken to that bookworm in months. - Oh. - What? She's off somewhere getting her, uh, doc, doctalate. - Yeah, a doctorate, yeah. - Yes, that. But I'm pretty sure, staying with you guys, she almost lost it. - Well, didn't think there were any colleges open right now. - Well, she's off remote learning somewhere, so I don't know what to tell ya. - Damn. - Why do you need to talk to her anyways? - I, well, I was just trying to call her to see if she could come help. I mean, I really could use someone so that I can concentrate on work 'cause we really need the money right now. - Yeah, I don't help with other people's kids. - Surprise. - But I can help with the money part. - How so? - Well, I had this online business selling sex toys to women who like tentacle porn. - Wait, do what? - And I still have it running, so I have the equipment. I can set up a Streamlab website and, uh, process orders for you. - Well, uh, I guess that could be helpful. Um- - All right, well, then I just need your customers' info, list of products to set everything up, and, uh, some email addresses, and we can get it rolling. - Wow. Uh, oh, okay. - Mm. Let me just get up, and not take a shower, and tickle the taco. I'll get back to ya. Okay, bye. (computer beeping) - Wait a minute. Okay, I'm gonna call. (computer beeping) (Ila gasps) Oh, my God. - Well, good to see you, too. (Ila exhales) - No, I'm sorry. I, that shit on your face just threw me off. - What? Is there shit on my face? - But (sighs) anyway, guess who I just talked to. - The Queen of England? How the fuck do I know? - Alexandra. - Why? - Well, I was looking for Tori. - Why? - Well, because I need help, but she didn't know where Tori was. - Oh, consider yourself lucky. - Yeah, but Alexandra offered to help. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Yeah, she, yeah, she's gonna, she's gonna streamline a website for me or something. - Look, you do not want Alex's help. - But, but I need, listen, I, I need help with the business, Lacy. And I honestly think God led me to call her. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh, and him too, yeah. - You have no idea what you've gone and done. - Well, one question. Do you know what tentacle porn is?
