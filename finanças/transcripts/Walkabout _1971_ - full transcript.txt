The bird picks desperately at the grain in the hope of penetrating through to the light... which he mistakes for the sun. This goes on for several weeks. When it has eaten itself so full that it cannot stand or see... it is drowned in cognac.

No. [Whimpering Continues] [Bird Squawking] [Birds Chirping] [Boy] I'll show you how to do karate. [Girl] There's a pool down there. [Boy] So the boy said, "I ought to be getting home from work." [Camera Shutter Clicks] He lived with his mother in a house on top of the hill. She had never spoken to him. He'd never heard her say a word. He thought she was dumb, and she was blind too. But every evening, when he came up the hill... he saw her sitting in the window, and she was talking. But as soon as she heard his key in the lock, she'd stop. And when he got inside, she wouldn't say a word. So, one evening, he made up his mind to hear what she was saying. - So he put the ladder - - No, he went round the back. [Boy] Oh, yes. He went round the back and got the ladder. - And he set it - - He carried it. [Boy] Yes, he carried it round to the front of the house... and set it up against the window. [Girl] You didn't explain that she was sitting upstairs. - I did. - You didn't. You left it out. Well, anyway - I don't know why you're telling him all this. He can't understand. He doesn't know what a ladder is. I expect we're the first white people he's seen. [Boy] It was very, very long and heavy... and he only just managed to get it in position in front of the house. Next, he climbed up the ladder and got on the windowsill. But he couldn't hear a word. She was only a few feet away behind the window. And her blind eyes were staring straight at him... and her mouth was opening and shutting. [Popping Lips] But he couldn't hear because she was speaking silently to herself. So he put his ear to the glass, but he still couldn't hear. So he decided to come down. But the windowsill was very narrow. And when he turned round, he knocked the ladder down! [Aboriginal Language] So he was stuck. He couldn't jump down because it was too far... and he couldn't shout to his mother... because then she'd know he'd been spying on her. So he just sat there. It got dark, and because there wasn't very much room on the sill... his legs grew very stiff. Sometimes, some people went past... but he couldn't shout to them for help because his mother would hear. So, there was a drainpipe going down the wall... and the boy thought, "If I reach across and get hold of that... I'll be able to climb down." So he reached across, but he slipped off the windowsill... and fell down and broke his neck. I told you. He doesn't understand. [Birds, Animals Chattering] Well, his mother went on sitting there and talking to herself... and she began to get worried because he was late home from work... and his dinner would get spoiled. So she said - [Girl] No, she didn't. She didn't say anything to him. - She got up - - Oh, that's right. - and groped her way down the stairs - - There's another aeroplane! Do you think he understood when I drew this house? That doesn't look like a house. You can't draw. [Boy] That looks like a platypus walking in space. Or a pterodactyl flying under the sea. I think he might take us to the moon. [Girl] I wish we had a proper pencil. [Aboriginal Language] Why did you say we were the first white people he's ever seen? I always thought you had lots of crayons and pencils in your satchel. Please have a look. By the look of that, I think he's gonna take us to Mars.
