Hey! Stop that. Put this right on there. Right there. See? This touches here and that touches there. How about here? This handle. It's touching. Is it? Then how about over here? It's touching, a little. Right? It shouldn't be. When you carve deeper, it'll get in the way. Yes, sir. So it must... It must be flat to the tip. Real flat. Be careful when using the back, too. When you dig through, raise the chisel. Leave a slight gap in the corners of the hole. Chisel deeper and forward. Don't just work on one spot. Once at a certain depth, pound harder. Make sure you don't use such a wide chisel. Use the 15mm or 18mm one. You can't work efficiently when you use a wider one. There once was a man feared as a Oni. Tsunekazu Nishioka, born in Nara Prefecture in 1908. Respected the trees and built architectures that last 1000 years. Passed away in 1995. What did Nishioka want to leave behind as his legacy? We started filming again. The Last Words of Miyadaiku Tsunekazu Nishioka Yakushiji, a Hosso Buddhist temple, has been praying for world peace for 1300 years, and to save people from the sea of agony. Hoin Yamada (Current Superintendent Priest of Yakushiji) Suffering from a massive fire and high winds, it was a dilapidated temple until the Showa period. "At least restore the Kondo enshrining the principle image." Their earnest wish started taking shape by offering 1000 yen sutra transcripts 40 years ago. This movement was led by superintendent priest Koin Takada. Which timber should be used? Can it be restored from scratch? It was all in a fog. It was Nishioka who stepped up to the plate. He left Horyuji to engage in the reconstruction of Yakushiji. Japan used to heavily rely on trees. The Garan style came into Japan and the local artisans adapted it for the local weather and climate. Nishioka was one of the established artisans. He needed to build structures that would last 1000 years like the East Pagoda. He was all humbled by the task. Horyuji was built just as Buddhism came in. There was this strong urge to fight back, not the religious... ...but the cultural aspects of the mainland. So became spartan. Whereas Buddhism was more accepted when this was built. Emperor Tenmu built a Garan for his child, who later became Empress Jito, so this one is extremely religious. Emperor Tenmu was succeeded by Empress Jito, so I felt there is a feminine softness to this Garan. I've been working on Yakushiji believing religious faith should be at its core. The basic concept was... the East Pagoda. The only one left from the Hakuho period, so I studied it extensively. On the suien of the East Pagoda is Onjo Bodhisattva, a celestial being playing the flute, drum and lute. Instead of ascending, it is descending onto our world. So this Garan was built to bring the Pure Land down to our world. That has been at the basis of this project. And the height of the building is vital when determining the size of the Garan. In this case, draw four circles with the radius equivalent to the height of the East Pagoda and the West Pagoda. It is designed to fit the corridors and the Daikodo. We did extensive research and drew up a restoration blueprint. We heard the roof is the determining factor in a wooden structure. How was the inclination and length of the roof determined? I based it on the East Pagoda. Determined based on the inclination of the roof of the East Pagoda. So accurate measurements of the East Pagoda serves as the basis. How long did that take you? Two years. The Kondo of Yakushiji was completed in 1976. The Hakuho-style Kondo was finally restored after 531 years since it collapsed in a high wind in 1445. Nishioka had turned 68 that spring. After the Kondo was restored, the West Pagoda was restored in 1981, and the Chumon in 1984, a Hakuho-style Garan gradually started to take form. Koin Takada (Superintendent Priest of Yakushiji) In 1991, Genjo Sanzo-in Garan was newly established in honor of Genjo Sanzo-hoshi, the founder of Hosso-shu. Yakushiji Woodworking Workshop When we started recording in 1990, they were working on the timberwork for Genjo Sanzo-in and timber preparation for the first stage of the corridors. Not bad. Do the same in the other direction. Yes, sir. Tilt it a bit more. Yes, like that. Less friction, right? You get less splinters. How many miyadaiku? We have another workshop, so we're slip into two teams, but we have around 13 in total. They came because of your fame? I think it was Yakushiji that fascinated them. In general, they work in pairs here. Nishioka's idea to enhance efficiency while training rookies on the job. Words can only go so far, but Nishioka tries to teach the subtle touch through words. Use your entire body. Or the wood shavings will break off. They don't simply apply their skills on just any type of timber. The timber comes first. Tools are made according to the traits and required shape of the timber. Nishioka believes skills only matter and come after that. They get hands-on experience by repeating the same steps, learning the traits of each timber. Their job is to learn the traits of each timber, build halls and pagodas by assembling them together, and acquire Nishioka's style. Horyuji Temple When Buddhism came in from the mainland in the mid-6th century, a number of large-scale temples were built mainly in Asuka. Horyuji dates back to that period. Its style resembling a palace from ancient Korea is a sign of nostalgia for homeland by the builders of this temple. This world's oldest wooden structure, a temple with a history of 1400 years is where Nishioka started. Its major reconstruction over 20 years in the Showa period trained him well. Nishisato of Horyuji, where carpenters, tilers and plasterers dwelled, protecting temples through repair and reconstruction. Born to be a third-generation miyadaiku, becoming the master miyadaiku of Horyuji was his inescapable destiny. Tsunekazu Nishioka, Master Miyadaiku I was my grandfather's apprentice rather than my father's. I was told to learn about the soil in order to know my timber. For that, I was told to go to an agricultural school. My father wanted to put me in an engineering school, but grandfather got his say. So my father put me in an agricultural school against his will. I didn't think it would help me become a miyadaiku either, but soon enough we started growing rice and vegetables in class. Ikoma Agricultural School (former) We were given a plot of land for practical training. We sowed seeds, flowers bloomed, then harvest... I understood what my grandfather meant by "the power of soil". I got interested. I graduated from an agricultural school and became a miyadaiku. But now, when I check timber, I can identify the type of timber and even where they're from. Grandfather was right for sending me to an agricultural school. Tsunekichi Nishioka (Tsunekazu's grandfather) When Tsunekazu was a child, his grandfather gave his position to Tsunekazu's father Naramitsu to teach Tsunekazu the fundamental values. Passing down the teaching "Do not speak of Garan without respecting the gods" and other secrets of Horyuji miyadaiku family by word of mouth. A special education to become the next master miyadaiku. When you first became the master miyadaiku of the Raido at 27, your grandfather who trained you had passed away. Yes, he had. So in a sense you lost your backing, I mean, your biggest mentor. Were you nervous? Well, yes. I believed I will be able to deliver, but I had doubts nonetheless, you know, uncertainties. Like whether I'd be able to deliver or give up midway. I'm afraid it's a very typical question, Kondo of Horyuji (after restoration) but how many years can wooden buildings last before it needs a repair? It lasts about 200 years after a repair. And the kawara tiles? Well, kawara...Old kawara tiles tend to last longer, but... Hirakudarimune Ukin I think they last about 200 years. After the Meiji period... Kawara tiles these days, 50 years. How about wakugi? Wakugi...must be wrought nails. Wakugi used at Horyuji Not those steel molten in a furnace shaped into a nail. They rot in no time. The major reconstruction of Horyuji over 20 years before and after the war. Nishioka went to war as a dutiful citizen, but always thought of his hometown, Nishisato. "Hometown is always beautiful. I want to go back to Horyuji." "I miss my family"... His heart was torn into pieces. My father used to... Every time he went to serve our country, Taro Nishioka he paid a visit to Horyuji and prayed, "I am going to war today." "If you still need me, please bring me back." "If not, I am ready to die serving my country." Clasping his hands together, he'd pray to the gods like that. Then come home and tell us, "Maybe the next time I'd see you will be at Yasukuni in Tokyo." He told me to go visit him at the shrine for the war dead with my mother and my sisters when the cherry blossoms bloomed. Fortunately he was able to return, but his first stop was Horyuji, thanking and paying his respect to the gods. Only then would he come home. Sent to war several times, but he would work on Horyuji's reconstruction the minute he returned. That is when he learned the true values of cypress used in Asuka architectures. Not only at Horyuji, but any cypress... Even the cypress at Horyuji dating back 1300 years, it gives off that fragrant scent when you shave its surface 6mm. It has that distinct scent. When you take off the kawara of the Kondo and the pagodas, what had stretched 6cm... Of course not all, but half of them slowly returns to its original state. That means it's still got that much resilience. In that sense, cypress has a long life. It's also got a long service life. It's amazing when you see a rafter revive after removing the kawara. Voice: Shigeru Aoyama I think it's god, you know, cypress is god. Corridor of Horyuji Master artisans have been protecting Horyuji believing, "Trees are god." Miyadaiku repair Garan while worshiping nature and respecting the trees. This project gave Nishioka a clear direction to his life. In 1945, Nishioka was in Mokpo, Korea when the war ended. And he was disarmed there. "The country is destroyed; yet mountains and rivers remain and spring comes to the castle; the grass is green again" The words in the letter of apology Nishioka wrote at the end of the war. Well, postwar... After the war ended, of course he was shocked by the fact that Japan lost. He returned to work while suffering from malnutrition. He was in no condition to work, but he went straight back to Horyuji... Probably doing some research. I remember him working hard. He kept himself busy. When he came home from work... We used to own some crop fields, so in the spring and summer, he'd go out and try to grow some food, however little that may be. Stretching himself too thin, he fell ill. Nishioka even worked as a peddler, but never built houses; his pride as a miyadaiku. The major reconstruction of Horyuji was worked on by key professionals in the architectural history of Japan. Yes, it was. Anything in particular that you remember from the time? Well, Professor Ohta, a professor emeritus at Tokyo Univ. Mr. Hirotaro Ohta who I still keep in touch with. He is very smart with a good memory, so no one could fool him. People were afraid of Kanematsu Inui, since he knew about carpentry so well. He scared my father and the other miyadaiku to their bones. Akira Nakayama, Architect Yuji Yamazaki, Director I was the only one who would challenge him, so he called me "the Oni of Horyuji". So I said, "If I'm the Oni of Horyuji, you're the Oni of the Ministry." That's how the "Oni of Horyuji" came to be. Before dawn on January 26, 1949, the Kondo went up in flames. This sped up the reconstruction which had stagnated after the war. But Nishioka with complete trust in trees and the scholars calling for reinforcement with steel beams clashed. I was strongly against putting in steel beams. Maybe you could put in wrought steel, but I was against using the typical steel beams. We used them since Prof. Takeshima, the construction office chief insisted, but when you take a look at the structure today, you see it's lacking the tension and is slacking. Which means, they shouldn't have been installed. Then I... I clashed again at Horinji. Horinji Because I strongly opposed, we called in Mr. Kakichi Suzuki, discussed further and we decided not to use them. The Takeshima-Nishioka conflict at Horinji made the headlines. The aged wooden pagoda of Horyuji may have been reinforced with steel beams, but I strongly opposed for the sake of this new pagoda, yet was told to use them. I installed the bolts, but that's all. No steel beams inside. They only came once a month. They wouldn't know. They wouldn't know that I put in timber instead of steel beams. That's a shocking confession... He could not bend his beliefs, so clashed a number of times. And finally, he decides to leave Horyuji. This is Gushikenki handed down the miyadaiku of Horyuji. Talks more on the necessary skills than the architectural style. For example, use magoita on the joints. Then apply whale oil onto the magoita to hold them in place. These things are written here, in great detail. Is Gushikenki kept by the miyadaiku family of Horyuji? That's right. It's been kept and handed down a line of master miyadaiku. So it has been in your family since your grandfather's... It had been in my family for three generations, but when I became master miyadaiku, I made a copy and returned the original copy to Horyuji. He returned the Gushikenki to Horyuji. That moment, he lost all ties with Horyuji. He vowed to live as a civilian when Japan lost the war, and have devoted himself to Horyuji. But a distance had grown between Nishioka and Horyuji. He truly appreciated the offer to become the master miyadaiku of Yakushiji. "Become a master miyadaiku who builds Garan." The wish of his grandfather and father. However... Nishioka was still debating in the car on his way to Yakushiji, where Superintendent Priest Gyoin Hashimoto was awaiting him. At age 62, he wasn't abandoning Horyuji, but devoting his remaining life to Yakushiji. He must become a new man today. The 30-minute ride from Horyuji to Yakushiji felt like eternity. Superintendent Priest Eiin Yasuda (high steward at the time) Mr. Nishioka was invited as the master miyadaiku of Yakushiji in 1970? Yes, 1970 or a little before that. What led to this? Superintendent Priest Koin Takada wanted Mr. Hirotaro Ohta to design a blueprint for the restoration of the Kondo. Then people like Mr. Minoru Ooka and Mr. Kiyoshi Hatano, the authorities in historical architecture gathered and a committee of 5, 6 people was formed and decided that, "Regardless of using a big or small construction company, it cannot be done without Mr. Nishioka as the master miyadaiku." "Asking Mr. Nishioka to become our master miyadaiku is the first step." Because we were close with Master Gyoin Hashimoto... Since Mr. Nishioka was working as the miyadaiku of Horyuji, we went to ask for the permission of the superintendent priest of Horyuji, Superintendent Priest Kenchu Josen at the time. Asking for Mr. Nishioka's assistance was the start. Garan restoration is realized through research, excavation and measurements. Nishioka worked energetically. East Pagoda of Yakushiji The East Pagoda was the only structure that kept its original style. The grand project started with taking its detailed measurements. Through two years of research on the East Pagoda, various data including style, structure and repair marks were collected in his notebooks and served as a vital resource for the restoration. On the first page it says, "Researchable only by carpenters. Research with an inner eye." Unlike a doctor with a stethoscope, you can only learn of the truth by disassembling the parts in a measurement survey. True measurements can only be taken by those who understand the value of life. But since it cannot be disassembled, the actual measurements can only be... Sensed by those who really understand. Which means, intuition is key to our work. Procurement of materials has been a source of a headache for Nishioka. Major areas in Japan no longer had over 1000-year-old cypress. A national forest in Kiso had some, but was refused as it was for breeding. Over 65% of national land once covered by woods and the cycle of felling and planting had supported architecture and craftworks. But decline in the forestry population has made even the construction of temples with Japanese timber difficult. Deciding that procurement was impossible in Japan, Nishioka flew to Taiwan based on the rough estimate he had in mind, without an actual blueprint. Why did you go into the mountains when you went to Taiwan to buy timber? In miyadaiku's tradition we say, "Don't buy timber, buy a mountain". This means you can't tell what kind of tree it is if it's been felled. The quality of the material changes with its soil. The traits of the timber are determined by the environment. So buy after walking the mountain, checking the soil and the environment. What I mean by environment is... Winds blow from the southeast in Taiwan. Trees growing on the south side have big branches growing southward. These branches will be twisted westward by the wind. But trees have the tendency to grow straight, against the wind. That becomes its trait. So it means learning the direction of the wind. Same goes for the trees on the north side. Identifying the traits and determining whether it's for a truss or a pillar. Get an idea before the tree gets felled. That's why I go into the mountains. Mt. Chi-Lan (Yilan County, Taiwan) A primitive forest of cypress atop a 2000-meter mountain range in central Taiwan. So quiet, as if all sounds are swallowed by the mountains. "Don't buy timber, buy a mountain" Nishioka went into the mountains four times and picked the timber himself. How are tree age determined? I use the diameter as an indicator. In Taiwan, you find them on steep cliffs and not in valleys. You can figure out the tree age by its diameter. Trees with fresh, green leaves are hollow inside. Those that can no longer live are not hollow and packed to its core. Same goes for both young and old trees. These aren't mere trees. They are gods. We use chainsaws today, but people used to treat trees as gods and cut them with respect. On the first trip, a Shinto priest Ikoma came with me and offered a prayer. After felling some, Superintendent Priest Takada planted Yoshino cypress saying, "To show gratitude." Taiwanese Agriculture and Forestry Company In 1992, felling trees in primitive forests was banned. Since then, Yakushiji had to buy already felled timber one by one from Taiwanese companies. "Use the trees according to the direction it was grown" Use timber from the south side of a mountain on the south side of a hall, and those on the north side on the north side. Basically, bring the timber exposed to the sun over the years to the south side of the hall where they get a lot of sun. This is strictly practiced until the Asuka, Hakuho and Tempyo periods. But in the Muromachi period, solid color was favored, so those exposed to the sun with many joints and patterns were brought to the back. Built true to these principles, that's why ancient architectures last for 1300 years. First, the height of the Kondo. How was it determined? The roof of the three-tier pagoda is aligned with the ridge of the Kondo. If taller than the roof of the pagoda, the Kondo will tower over the pagodas. The idea was to keep them the same height to create a balanced Garan. It's about 21m. The Yakushi Nyorai statue is enshrined inside, but the concrete core... Well, when we applied for the restoration of the Kondo, we were told to use earthquake and fire resilient concrete to protect the world treasure, the Yakushi Nyorai statue. That's why we ended up using concrete, but I was against the idea as I heard from Mr. Teijiro Muramatsu that it only lasts for 100 years. Why would you cover it with a wooden structure that lasts 1000 years? The concrete will destroy the Kondo. I begged them not to, but the authorities would not give us permission otherwise. So I was forced to use concrete, but I'm still not fond of using concrete. The Oni of Horyuji building a concrete structure. The 37 carpenters assembled from around the country were frustrated. But instead of explaining why he has to use concrete against his will, Nishioka started working in silence. So will they be redoing the concrete in 200 years? Or will they... Given the structure, they must. With cultural properties, the authorities should listen to me and stop thinking of using concrete for the storage compartment. Or else you have to keep on repeating the same thing. After many twists and turns, a heavenly paradise appeared on earth. Nishioka was filled with gratitude to those who welcomed him to Yakushiji. Next, Nishioka started preparing for the restoration of the West Pagoda. When he was a boy, he used to come admire the pagoda with his grandfather. Being able to build that same pagoda, Nishioka was shaking from excitement. The West Pagoda restoration wasn't at the temple's request. You claimed that the West Pagoda must be restored? We call it "kenpakusho" at the temple... So to Mr. Uchikawa of Shinto Sozai... We first submitted it to him. Then he made an announcement when he came to Yakushiji. He lectured them, "You should be more concerned like Nishioka." People eventually agreed and that's how it started. They had enough with the Kondo... Enough with the Kondo, but if necessary, they wanted to wait until the next generation. Superintendent Priest Takada told me. Then what boosted the talk for the restoration of the West Pagoda? Mr. Ikoma asked us whether to buy timber with the leftover money, but he didn't know what to do when timber arrived, so the Superintendent Priest said, "We now have such an amazing Garan." "Horyuji has a stock of cypress timber at all times." "They're for urgent repair needs at times of earthquakes and fire." Mr. Ikoma was impressed by this and trusted our words about the Garan. That's how we successfully fooled him. Nishioka later confessed that he was ready to seppuku if anything went wrong. It was such a mentally-straining project. In April 1981, the West Pagoda was finally completed after four years. A "live structure" only using timber, without steel or concrete. The two pagodas lined the Yakushiji Garan for the first time in 450 years, since the Edo period. Newly building a Garan is your final, ultimate dream as a master miyadaiku? Well, yes. Your ultimate wish? Yes, my wish. There's an old saying, "It costs you a life to build a pagoda." Which means I've already died four times. He used to just work on projects as a miyadaiku when he was asked to. But seeing Superintendent Priest Takada raise money with sutra transcripts to reconstruct the Hodo had cleared Mr. Nishioka's mind and purified his heart. And realized he can't work like in his younger days, but couldn't retire so asked his salary to be cut by half. We received such a request. But we weren't sure if we could do such a thing... We were greatly touched by his kindness. He also said that he's giving lectures now that he's become famous, and receiving lecture fees. But since he's receiving his salary from Yakushiji, he always brought the money to be used for the restoration of the Hodo. He was so... selfless... He had a strong determination as a miyadaiku who builds Garan. In 1990, besides the reconstruction of the corridor, there still was the Kodo rebuilt in the Edo Period to reconstruct. Nishioka hastily started preparing as if rushed by his remaining time. My greatest goal is to restore the Garan of Yakushiji. It was built in the Edo period, so a Hakuho-style architecture. Which means it has to be the same style as this Kondo. There's a record that a 9-meter shukucho hung from the center shumidan. What is a shukucho? An embroidered Buddha. Buddha was embroidered on a thin piece of cloth. It was 9 meters long, so the pillar must at least be 9 meters. In terms of the structure, how is the Hakuho style different from the Edo style? The pillars are much thinner. Smaller construction ratio. And the ceiling here has kumiko with smaller squares inside larger squares. It's called the kumiko goutenjo. The larger squares are the goutenjo. With kumiko inside. This style came in after the Muromachi period. But Asuka and Hakuho styles do not have gouden. They all become large kumiko like on these doors here. The truss is cut every 1 ma? This is its structural weakness. Ancient architectures need long truss running through 2,3 ma. They're all joined at the same place. They are both joined here. Yes, at the same place. Truss Architrave If one is joined here, the other shouldn't. They must be alternated. Or else collapses in an earthquake. If you are to rebuild a Kodo larger than this one, how much timber... Well, my estimate would be 630m3 for the Kondo. And the surface area of the Kondo is about 400m2. This here has 480m2 because it's been restored. In that sense, that one is two-tiered, while this one is one-tiered. That one is 630m3. And this one will probably take 720m3. So the estimate came down to 630 - 650m3. How did Nishioka reconstruct the corridor leading to the Kodo? According to the records, Yakushiji had fukuro. Stylobate Horyuji had tanro with only one walkway. At Yakushiji, there was a renji in the middle and walked on both sides. I conducted an excavation research based on this, then started constructing once I found sufficient evidence. What's more, it connects to the Chumon and the Daikodo, So it must go through and under the Chumon. As for the Daikodo, you have the mokoshi. The corridor must fit under the mokoshi. Because of such restrictions, I first designed the Kodo. And for the corridor to fit under the roof of the Chumon. So the height was determined based on them. The blueprint is made into a full-scale drawing by the vice master miyadaiku. Why a life-scale drawing? Blueprints are drawn on a board, so can't draw big ones. 1:20 scale is the limit given its actual size. If the line is off by even a bit, it creates a huge difference. So we make a life-scale drawing to correct this. Then create a kataita from this accurate life-scale drawing, then use it on each part to cut them into the right shape. Kataita are created from the life-scale drawing. A kataita is created for each and every part. Miyadaiku conduct these steps using a sashigane. Let me talk about sashigane a little. They used the komajaku, the Chosen scale during the Asuka period. Then the toshaku, which came in from Xian, in the Hakuho period. There were different types of scales, but settled upon what we use now in the Edo period. It was standardized in the Meiji period and needed government approval for sale. Before that, there was the Tengujaku in Kyoto, the Nenbutsujaku in Shiga, but they were all slightly different. They were then unified into this Nenbutsujaku scale. On the front, it's 1 shaku 6 sun 5 bu, and the back is 1 shaku 4 sun 1 bu 4 rin. On the back is a scale for √(1x1) shaku. Also on the shorter end of the back, there are small centimeter-like marks. You measure the diameter with this, and it gives you the circumference. It's all worked out. So historically speaking, sashigane has been used like... Its usage was... Measure 5 sun with the shorter end to determine the roof's inclination. Then measure 1 shaku with the longer end. Tilt it and you get a 5 sun inclination, with 6 sun, a 6 sun inclination. People use ink to leave marks, but you need sashigane to do that. We have electric calculators and other devices these days, but people used to only use sashigane. For any calculation. Just one sashigane took you pretty far. What kind of tools are used to prepare the timber? Nishioka showed us his tool box. Before the Muromachi period, they built halls and pagodas only with these. Many tools were invented over the centuries. Yariganna, lost after Muromachi, was revived by Nishioka at Horyuji. The Architecture and Other Structures Division of the Ministry of Culture requested that the finish of all Asuka architectures be done with yariganna. Yariganna has not been used after the Muromachi period, so we had a hard time researching from excavated articles. We had one made in Miki of Banshu, but couldn't cut a thing with it. Although hard against the grind stone, the steel wouldn't cut anything. We had a hard time... Then thought maybe we should reshape a nail from the Asuka period. So we gathered worn out old nails and asked a swordsmith in Sakai to hammer it into shape. Masanori Mizuno, Swordsmith He created two, three of them. Only then were we able to give a finishing shave with it. So basically, high-heat processed iron from a smelting furnace won't work. Just like hammering out a Japanese sword, 1 kan of iron must be hammered out to 400mm. Water is applied on Japanese swords. Only that kind of iron works. When you, Mr. Ishii, came to study under Mr. Nishioka, did you have any difficulties using yariganna? What was difficult? How to sharpen it. When you sharpen a molding plane or a chisel, you don't hold onto its blade, but with yariganna, you must. So I cut my hand numerous times, and scraped my fingers on the grind stone as I have to work closely with it. So it's hard to sharpen, which makes it hard to cut. It's all up to sharpening properly. Yeah, useless if it's not sharpened properly. Not a single miyadaiku goes to dinner at five after work. They sharpen their tools for the following day. Chouna is another tool used from the ancient times. A vital tool for Nishioka's style which utilizes the traits of timber. They used to wear straw sandals instead of shoes like we do now. Why straw sandals? For the blade... So not to damage the blade. The blade was more important than our feet. "Only a real miyadaiku after you cut your sole." I see. Hold it with the blade facing up, then put it under your arm... That's good. Yeah, that's perfect. Keep it like that. Or else you won't be able to move it freely. If you hold it here, your movement is restricted. But if you hold it slightly shorter, it works. Same for yariganna. It's stupid if you keep it long only for show. You can't use it. Tools aren't ornaments. It's not real unless it serves a purpose. Come up with a way to utilize it. Our height and size are all different, so the handle length must be adjusted accordingly. See? You get it? Daiganna came into Japan after Muromachi and drove out yariganna. Daiganna was called Kudaraganna, so I think it came from Korea. And well... It probably came in together with oga. Oga is still used in Manchuria like it used to in Japan. Oga is a big saw pulled from both sides by two people? It came into Japan around the same time as daiganna. Which means that oga and daiganna could be treated as a set and serve a purpose together as a set? Yes. Then what role did oga and daiganna play in the works of miyadaiku? When daiganna came in, the works became more detailed and delicate. The construction ratios became more detailed. Hanegi was now used to support the eaves. Then probably some more time down the timeline, the systemized construction ratio was completed and blueprints were developed. Did daiganna have any influence on them? Yes, for sure. It allowed a more delicate, detailed finish, so for Garan architecture... Actually it even changed the technique of Garan architecture. It's so uneven. This side isn't, but this side is. This corner is low and so is this one, so this is no good. If you place it here, make sure it's perfectly level. Make that kind of a ruler. Make it out of wood, a wooden ruler. We've used it for four generations, so it has turned shiny black. Chocolate brown. The metal used here is really good. Not many of them lasts this long. It's still sharp as new. It's the best we have. Did the mount become thinner as you used and adjusted it? Right, as we used it, it started getting thinner... Now it's this thin. In your case, you make your own mount, then buy the blade and metal parts? We own a mountain and fell oak trees from there. We always fell them during New Years, then expose it to the furnace smoke for three to ten years. Then take it off the furnace and use it. This is to keep insects away. The post materials are manufactured and transported from Taiwan. What kind of tools and techniques are used to prepare them? The chouna process. The octagonal timber is reshaped into a hexacontatragon. Like yariganna, chouna is Nishioka style's characteristic tool. I use yoki, chouna or kanna, but... I consider it as an extension of my body instead of an object, and shave with my soul instead of force. I use them with such mindset. I engage in work by putting my soul into the timber I am working on. The sumitsubo we use now is really old. It's been around from the time of the Greeks. We use this ink to make hexacontatragon. After using chouna, the surface is smoothed with an electric molding plane. We use electric tools due to budgetary and time constrains. But the finish is all done by yariganna. Electric molding planes don't really cut. It tears the surface off. The finish is very rough, with a lot of splinters. When it rains on it, molds grow and its service life deteriorates. So my policy is to do all the finish by yariganna. After the electric molding plane, chimaki on the pillar is cut out. The kashiranuki shiguchi is cut out. Kashiranuki, a horizontal material, fits in here to connect the pillars. The color and pattern of the timber is different when we use yariganna. If you shave with maruganna, it looks stiff, but if you use yariganna, it looks softer and the service life is longer. In 1992, hot days persisted. Nishioka fell ill and long-term hospitalization was necessary. In the autumn, he came back to the site after three months. It's great, you mastered sumigi. Applying ink to the sumigi. Nishioka is watching with sharp eyes. Leave this here as is. Leave the bottom as much as possible. It's better to keep it. Cut it if it gets in the way during noji. It's better to keep it. "Think about the timberwork" The words of the god for miyadaiku. Don't shave sideways. Never sideways, not to the side. Straight till the very end. Are you holding your breath? Once you place the molding plane, hold your breath till the end. If you breathe, the shaving breaks off. Nishioka was teaching the fundamental values to the young miyadaiku this day. Make sure the wood here sticks out as much as possible so it doesn't hit this metal. Stick it out in a round shape so the genno hammer doesn't hit the ring. For that, take this off with a round filer and graze it. You have to adjust and customize it yourself. You haven't, have you? Haven't customized? Show me those there. Nishioka knew this would be his last construction site, and never be able to give them such a blessed training environment. He was also aware of his lifestyle, devoting his soul to creating architectures that lasted for over 1000 years, no longer matched the trend of the time. "I will retire soon." "Remember and practice what you learned here." It seemed like he was trying to convey such message to them. You look so different from 20 years ago. Really? Hiroshi Hayami, Miyadaiku "If you place it here, make sure it's perfectly level." I was scared of him. Unapproachable. Especially because I didn't know anything about miyadaiku. He admired him like god everyday. For youths, it's great to have a presence who will yell at them. They followed in Nishioka's footsteps even after his death. You will continue to work on Yakushiji projects? Yes, until they tell me they don't want me anymore. Koji Ishii, Miyadaiku What did you like about Mr. Nishioka? He stuck to his principles. He worked hard and struggled a lot too. And based on the knowledge he acquired through his efforts, he'd stick to his beliefs and principles even against major scholars and priests. This doesn't mean he's bullheaded, but he never budged when it came to things he acquired through experience. After four years of preparatory work, it was January 1991 that they started on the timberwork. Ricchuushiki to pray for the safety of the construction was conducted. Richuushiki (January 1991) It was a cold morning. Age and weariness could be seen on Nishioka's face who came from a hospital. He was not told, but cancer was spreading deep inside Nishioka's body, acting violently and giving him excruciating pain at times. It is customary to place the first pillar in the southeast corner as it is said to bring good omen. The cypress tree from Taiwan has now changed form to live a new life and serve a new mission. This day, after watching them work for two hours, Nishioka went back to the hospital on a car driven by a miyadaiku. The construction was going smoothly without Nishioka for three months. Then Nishioka paid them a visit. So timberwork now... What do you pay most attention to during this timberwork stage? Whether we're all mentally together. If you look here, they are working in silence, without a word. Their hearts are working as one. Things get done without instructions. Their hearts and minds are united as one. We have 13 miyadaiku, but they delegate work amongst themselves. They know who'll do what. So they can assemble perfectly. This day, Nishioka indirectly announced his retirement... In kuen, it says shishinso in a Garan is... In building Doto, the hearts and minds of the builders are the key. The role of the master miyadaiku is to unify the 100 minds of 100 miyadaiku. I'm told to... When I realize I no longer have the power to lead 100 miyadaiku, then I should show respect and resign. Insightful words. The commander of an army is ready to step down. At age 84, he wants to make a graceful exit. This became his last day at the construction site of Yakushiji. Nishioka was ready to resign from master miyadaiku at this point. Long-term hospitalization since the first stage of the corridor, but was master miyadaiku until he took his last breath... Yes. When the West Pagoda was built, he said it is yet to be tested. By test he meant an earthquake or other disaster hitting the region... If the East Pagoda remained while the West Pagoda collapsed, he said he would lose face like no other. Then the Hanshin Earthquake happened, but they both survived, and Mr. Nishioka was still present, so Takada called him and told him, the West Pagoda passed its test. He was really concerned about it. Until he died, he was the master miyadaiku of Yakushiji... Yes, he was the master miyadaiku of Yakushiji for life. So I think he felt like he was the teradaiku of Yakushiji. Yakushiji did not accept his resignation. This meant they were asking him to die on the site. Nishioka bawled in the hospital. Unlike the modern method of fixing the iron materials in place, wooden structures are built under the principle of connecting the parts. Kumimono and tsugite are both the frame and joints of flexible structures. This technique disperses the impact of an earthquake on the structure. Installation of the truss. Distortion is the biggest challenge when installing a truss. There is always a possibility of distortion after it's been prepared. Even if it did get distorted, there are ways if it curves up or down. But sideways... If the truss is too high against the balk... What do you do in a situation like that? In case of a truss, make it so that it turns outward. You mean... The weight of the roof will push it this way, so the truss will be pushed in because of the weight. It's better to make it so that it's curving outwards. Nishioka doesn't think a blueprint alone is enough when constructing. Selecting timber, processing using tools and building. He believes the entire process is architecture. Nishioka's philosophy is the antipole of standardized, mass production. That's why he tells others to build by reading the traits of timber. It's customary to install sumigi longer than set in the blueprint. All the weight of nuki will be on this sumigi. We push it up just enough so that it doesn't look like an umbrella. Give it a slightly steeper angle. The angle depends on the material used for sumigi? Depends on the material... We must identify its trait... It only comes with experience. Comes with experience. Edo artisans used to have special designs on the bottom of tsugite to show off their skills. Compared to ancient architectures... They're unnecessary. It's to show off... The Garan we build are based on the Hakuho and Asuka period structures. But what we see today were created from real scratch back in the days... They were great masters with amazing talents. I think this comes from their faith and devotion to enshrine the gods. They didn't want anything extravagant. Instead, focused on passing on the life of the trees. Nishioka's belief was passed on to the younger generation. That is why construction continued smoothly even without Nishioka. Nomune was installed and the roof started taking shape. We heard that wall clay is aged for two, three years at Yakushiji. Could you elaborate... It means we first work on wall clay when building a Garan. We dig clay out from the region where we are building. Then throw in some hay, age it for three years... Keep adding hay and age it for some time. Then bacteria start forming. Bacteria are all protein. So add protein as glue to sticky clay. Once it dries, dirt won't wash away even when it rains. If you don't age them, rain will wash away the clay and expose the hay. That won't happen. So you start with clay? We start from finding clay. In 1991, the first stage of the corridor construction, in 1993, its second stage was completed. Yakushiji was starting to take form as Hakuho Garan. At age 85 now, have you... Do you think you have surpassed your great teacher, your grandfather? No, I don't think so. I haven't. I still refer to his words. I just think, "I see, he was right. What he told me is so true." He had been devoting his life to work. This was his last work site. I will take full responsibility as the master miyadaiku, so I want those working under me not to fear, go all the way out and make mistakes. That's what I want from them. Be bold. Enduring winds and snow. That is the true form of architecture. That's why we must give 1000 years of life to architectures. He lived true to his beliefs and words. Don't just be pragmatic. I want people to do real work even if it takes time. Not a makeshift work, but I want people to do real work.
