Mateo, sit properly! Where are we going? Mateo! I left all the samples on your desk. And the latest reports on Tank 4, in case you need them. You already told me. All right. You know I can be by myself for a couple of weeks. Yes, I know. If the female isn't better in five days, please call me. I can't wait for you to go. Diego. - Mama! - Hi, honey. - How was it? How are you? - Fine. Fine? What are you making? - A plasticine fish. - Really? It looks great. Where's Aunt Laura? Aunt Laura has been looking for the ball for ten minutes. Here you are, dear. I almost missed picking him up because of the traffic jam. We were nearly late for the dentist's office. I put the date of the next check- up inside the bag. Feel here. Don't you dare have it before we get back. I'll do my best. - Has he had his afternoon snack? - He didn't want to. You didn't? - Are you ready? - Yes. Have you got your bag? - You look handsome. - I got dressed by myself. That's good. I'll get it. Diego, never mind. Come on out. I found it. You found it! You're a treasure, you know? Will you lend it to me? Yes, but promise me you'll take care of it. OK? - I put it on by myself. - Let me see. Shall we go? Are you looking forward to getting on the ship? It's not a ship, it's a ferry. - How do you know that? - My aunt told me. - Did she? - Yes. Are you looking forward to getting on the ferry? You are? This is your first time on one. But I've drawn lots of them. - Who lives in the sea? - The fish. Yes, but which fish? Whales. - What else? - Dolphins. And? Orange fish. Mermaids. Let's go inside. Soon I'll have to show you how to tie your shoelaces. How soon? Very soon. Look, Mum. Where are they going? On holidays, like us. - When do we get there? - When we get there. - When are we going to swim? - Straight away. But you've got to put your rubber ring on. - Do you have a rubber ring? - No. I know how to swim. Can I go play? Aren't you tired? Well, take this off. We thank you for the trust you have placed in us and wish you a happy stay. Attention all passengers. A 5-year-old boy has been lost. He has dark hair and is wearing a brown jumper. Do you think Diego might've gone to an outdoor section? - No, not without me. - We'll reach the island in no time. Once there, we'll empty the ship and search for your son thoroughly. You're letting everyone off the ship? It'll be easier to look for him that way. Diego! Come with me, please. - We need the passenger list. - We've asked for it. - What about the other patrol? - Send it inland. - Give me that, please. - It just came in. Go ahead. And the number plates for caravans? What are you waiting for? - A checkpoint here. - Right. - Check these trucks too. - Yes. What phone number do we put down? The one on the card? Yes. Would you like to add another number, just in case? - Your husband's or a relative's... - I don't have a husband. One number is fine. For the moment, we can't do any more. I'm so sorry. Do you remember how bad the female was? She's adapted perfectly now. In fact, they're thinking about bringing in two more. Really? It adapted overnight. - Did you go to the pool today? - Yes. And? Don't push yourself. You need time to overcome your phobia. Yes, I know. But if I don't work or sleep, I'll go crazy. - But you are working. - Yes, I fill graphs with data. I need to be in the water. - What shall we play? - Hide and seek? I don't like hide and seek. - Why not? - Because you might not find me. - Did you take your pills? - No, I don't want any pills. At least you'd sleep for several hours straight. When I do that I wake up in worse shape than before. It'd be good for me to go back to work. You just need more time. Be patient. - Laura. - Yes? Can you open up? Can you take him? Yes, that's me. The age of the body matches, and the approximate date of death. In any case, that's never a decisive factor. To confirm the identity of the body, we need a DNA test, or, in this case, a relative for identification. - Thank you for coming... - Where is he? Wait. It's not him. Are you sure? What do you think? It isn't my son. - It's not him. - It's not him? I knew it, I knew it. Laura, let's get out of here. Excuse me, can we leave? - We have a slight problem. - What's wrong? We assumed the statement would be positive... Why did you assume that? The mistake is ours. We're sorry. We have to take DNA samples, from both you and the body. And that requires the presence of a judge. - And? - He won't be here until Monday. Until Monday? Our plane leaves tomorrow. It's only three days. I'm sorry. One room with two beds. How long are you staying? Probably until Monday. No problem. The police called us. The hotel is almost empty, so you won't be disturbed. It's room number seven. It's at the end of the hall. Welcome. Since when? Of course. Don't forget, take his temperature every two or three hours. Yes. No water. - What did you say? - Nothing. - What is it? - The baby has a fever. Here. Let's see if you're lucky tonight. What is he doing? I didn't sleep well. Didn't you hear anything last night? No. Like what? I don't know. There were noises. I woke up a couple of times. I didn't hear anything. As long as we have to stay, shouldn't we get out for a bit? Maybe rent a car. Guests always ask, so I have a couple of cars to rent. - We wanted it until Monday. - No problem. - It's not new, but it's a good car. - I'm sure. The tank's full. - And we have to return it full. - Be careful, it uses a lot of gas. There are two gas stations on the whole island, and they both close at night. This is so you know where you are. We're here. This beach is nice, but you have to cross the mountain. This one's good. And this one, but the road there is bad. This one's very quiet. Well, they're all quiet here. I'll go buy some things and we'll eat here. - I'll come. - There's no need. Rest up. Maria. - What are you up to? - Nothing. - Shall we eat? - Sure. Your hair, it's wet. - Did you go swimming? - A little. A little? Are you serious? This is good news. Before, when I was alone on the beach, I got scared. Scared? I don't know what to call it. It was a kind of... It's nothing. How much did his temperature go up? No, of course it's not normal. Tomorrow? What time? Of course I'd rather be with my son than waste my time here. She's the same as always, a bit strange. No, of course not. You know she sometimes made me nervous. Yes, all right. We'll talk later. I love you too. - I don't like leaving you here alone. - If you stay, you'll feel worse. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be back in a couple of days. I know. There's a camping ground on the north of the island. It has lots of trailers, but I don't know if any are for rent. And the car isn't equipped to hook up a trailer. It's not for that, don't worry. - Here you are! - How do you get there? Hello? Good morning. Excuse me... - What can I do for you? - I'm looking for a trailer. Do you know if a trailer came here yesterday or today? No one's come or gone for a week. I'm sorry, but all the trailers on the island come through here sooner or later. This is the only place where they can get gas canisters. They took me to identify the body too. But I knew it wasn't him. Somebody took Mateo away. It's impossible for a child to disappear in a car accident. What did the police say? They questioned my husband, but didn't find anything. On this island everyone is a friend. We separated on the day of the accident. We were running away from him. He's a creep. Does your husband still live on the island? Yes, he moved into a greenhouse when he lost his job on the ferry. Hello? What the fuck are you looking for? - I just wanted to ask you... - Ask me what? I talked to your ex-wife. - I'm looking for my son. - Go to hell! We investigated him, but got nothing out of him. I doubt he was involved. - Reporting him won't do any good. - But he attacked me. Listen to me. That man is having a hard time. Let me remind you that you entered his house. He could report you. Call me if you need anything. I was going to answer, but the phone fell on the floor. So the boy's all right. I'm glad. Yes, everything's fine. Yes, don't worry. All right, big kiss. Come here. Hello. Could I talk to you for a minute? - I thought I saw a boy... - I don't understand you. - Don't you speak Spanish? - No Spanish. - What shall we play? - Hide and seek? - I don't like hide and seek. - Why not? Because you might not find me. If I don't, I'll keep looking for you. Always. How do you feel? The doctor told me you're OK. Where were you going at that hour? You know he brought you to the hospital, don't you? And he called me. How did you get there? I saw your car at the camping ground. Do you know a German woman? I know several. Why? Red hair, lives in a trailer. Do you know her? I do. We all know each other here. She seemed a bit strange to me. Strange? Look, the judge comes tomorrow. They'll be able to take the samples they need from you. Then you can go back home. I'm sure you'll feel better there. I'll take you to your car. I'll wait outside. Good evening. Wait a second. You 're leaving tomorrow, right? Yes. I'll just be a second. Look. - You can keep it. - No, thanks. It'll go up there with the rest. Do you know this woman? Yes. Her name's Tania. She lost her head a long time ago. Her husband left her and she found herself all alone. I haven't talked with her in ages, but everyone says she's crazy. They even kicked her out of the school. She was the school teacher. Of German? No, everything. She was the teacher. But she doesn't speak Spanish. Sure she does, better than I do. Diego... Are you OK? Let's go. They won't let me go out. - What? - I'm sick. Let's go home, honey. Let's go. My boy. You can't go. Diego! Diego, honey. It's over. Diego, it's over! Good evening. - Is everything OK? - Yes... No, I'm out of gas. I've got a jerry can in the trunk. No, would you take me to a gas station? Both of them are shut at night. I'm always prepared, just in case. - Did you get lost? - No... - Are you going to the hotel? - Yes. This will be enough until tomorrow. Are you sure everything's all right? 3-5-1, we have a report. Smoke. On Arenas Blancas. Go ahead. - A report of smoke. - On the beach? - Someone lit a fire. - Got it. I've got to go. Diego, come here. I've got a game. Do you want to play? - A game? - Yes. Do you want to play? - Yes. - Look. - See that truck there? - Yes. The blue one. We have to get there without being seen. Then we hide inside. But who wins? The one who makes the least noise. Right, let's go. Hold on tight to my hand. This will be your hiding place. - Don't make any noise. - No, honey. - When do I come out? - When I come to get you. You can't move until I come to get you, OK? - Do you need some help? - No. - The pedestrian entrance is there. - Yes, yes. Diego! Diego, honey. My love. - I don't like this game. - It's over. It's done. I don't want to play with you now. We're not going to play. We're going home, all right? At least this room is nice. It's not as noisy. Yes, I sleep better there. Though the window's sealed too. You're not missing anything. Call me if you want me to bring anything.
