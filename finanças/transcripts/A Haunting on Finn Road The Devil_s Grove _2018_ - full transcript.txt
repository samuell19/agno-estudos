Subtitles by explosiveskull This house was built around 1895 by my great-grandfather. It's solid brick, it was considered to be the mansion of the times, because a lot of houses were built out of wood. I think I remember my dad saying, like back in those days it cost around 5000 dollars to build it. So, it was my great-grandfather who originally had the house built, and he did pass away in the home, and I believe in one of the bedrooms upstairs. INTERVIEWER: Can you you tell me what life was like here on the farm? Well, it was always lots of fun because you always had grandma and grandpa around, so they were always giving sweets, making cakes, and cooking and things like that. INTERVIEWER: Growing up here on the farm, you've had a lot of different experiences, a lot of positive experiences. When did they start to change? When did you realize that there was in fact something else happening here? I kind of started with waking up in the middle of the night, to dark things in the room, and there were times when you would feel like you were being watched, or something would pass by you. One time I woke up out of a dead sleep and I had felt like someone had just walked by the bed. I just remember closing my eyes and being so terrified and scared that I couldn't even scream, and that was pretty much it. My father passed away in December of 2015, but prior to him passing, we had discussed purchasing the house from him. I'd always loved the home, so it had a lot of sentimental attachment for me. We had to do some work to it. We couldn't move into it immediately, but when we did, the kids started having some experiences themselves. You know, come three o'clock in the morning, and they could hear what sounded like footsteps going up and down the stairs. They didn't like being home alone, they didn't like going into the basement. They started telling me about things that were happening to them. So I woke up in the morning, and I came down here, because I have to attend to the fire. I heard what sounded like my uncle, because he used to work down here a whole lot, and I heard it thinking it was him, and I responded, hello? And didn't hear anything, so I was like, okay, so I walk this way, to tend to the fire, still not hearing any response, and I'm like that's weird, he's not down here. You know your family members' voices. You hear the voice, and you know it's them. It sounded exactly like him. INTERVIEWER: How did your family change, from before you moved in here, until you moved here. What did this home, this house, do? In a sense I think it kind of did drive everybody apart, because my kids knew how fond of the house that I was, and my husband also knew I was very fond of the house, and they were really trying, they just got to a point where they couldn't do it anymore. The girls didn't want to stay here anymore. They were petrified to stay here, so, they wanted to move out, they wanted out. They weren't getting any sleep, they were having a hard time, they'd say stuff in the morning, about things that happened at night, so you've got to look at what's best for the kids. When they did leave the house, my ex-husband had told me that Bella was worried about whatever it was, following her. I know she was like burning sage, and he claimed that she was barricading herself in her bed. It took their dad talking to me about some of the things that were happening, and they were also having some conversations with my sister Julie about some of the history. I kind of purposely neglected telling them a lot of the details of the history of the house, because I wanted them to be able to experience the same childhood that I had, and for the most part was pretty happy in this house. My name is Julie, I am Rebecca's sister, her older sister, there's nine years between us. Lots of things have happened out here over the years, and when you mention those things to the family members, you kind of get in trouble for it, because we were Catholics, and you weren't allowed to talk about that kind of stuff, because it was always the demonic side, that if you believed in it, or whatnot. But I had things happen to me, the lights coming on in Uncle Luke's room, nobody was every allowed in that room, and it was like this ice-cold room, like the parlor downstairs. I didn't know a lot about the story about, about my Uncle Luke, and what had taken place here. The only details that I have, or that I was told, he used a gun, and it was at the top of the upstairs, apparently put the gun in his mouth, and shot himself in the head. My understanding is that my Uncle Burt, and my father were coming home from school, when they had heard a gunshot. They still didn't want to talk about it, because it was a suicide in a Catholic family, and there was a bad story, Uncle Luke wasn't liked by a lot of people, he was grouchy, he'd come back from the war, a whole different man, like most men did, and he fell apart, took his life at the top of these stairs. Well, I know that my grandfather had a brother, named Christian, that apparently died of an asthma attack that he had, and started hemorrhaging and bleeding out in the orchard. Another one of my grandpa's brothers had killed himself here in the house. Both of my grandparents passed away here, and my father had also passed away in the home, as well. INTERVIEWER: Can you tell us about the former use of the parlor? The didn't have funeral homes back in the day. They would have a funeral in the parlor. My sister had told me that they also opened it up to neighbors and friends. I think she had said that there was like over 100, 150 different funeral-type gatherings that have occurred in the parlors. When he was living here, he was living here alone. He would sleep with lights on all the time, and TV's on, and things like that. Probably a couple different times he had called my sister, or my cousin Josh, in the middle of the night. When her dad was here he would call quite frequently, but I remember his daughter Julie telling me that one night he called and said there's people in my house. He'd be like, Jule, Jule, I swear, someone's running around here calling my name. So I'm like okay, I'm coming over. He was like, I'm gonna shoot 'em, I've got my gun ready, and she would say okay, I'm coming over, don't shoot me, I'm gonna come into the house, don't shoot me. When I come in he pointed at the door, and I'm like dad, what the heck? He said, Jule I don't really know what's going on. There's this little Mexican girl, and she's coming up to me, and she's talking Spanish to me, and then she runs off, and I told her, wait a minute, tell me what you said. And she went to hide behind the door, and I go look behind the door and she's not there. And that's when we found out that he had actually taken a shot at something. Scared him enough to where he actually took a shot at it. I think my dad had experiences here, and didn't want to admit to them, and talk about them. So after my dad passed away, I was trying to do some finishing touches in the house, with the floorboards. I noticed as I came down the stairs, there was clearly a temperature change. You could feel the coolness, and I could actually see my breath. At that point I became extremely freaked out, and said I'm not dealing with this fuckin' shit today, and I left. INTERVIEWER: Just out of curiosity, did you happen to hear that loud bang just now, while you were talking? Yep. Actually see my breath, at that point I became extremely freaked out. At that point I became extremely freaked out. INTERVIEWER: Are these the kind of sounds that you were talking about? Just bangs and unexplained noises? This is, you're used to this? Yeah, I think that I have become immune to it, to the point to where I don't even pay any attention to some of it anymore. INTERVIEWER: There was an incidence where you told us about your brother, using a Ouija board, here on the property. Could you tell us about that? Yes, I know that he was quite a rebellious teenager, but one night I had come home and he and his friends had been using a Ouija board. More so recently in conversations with my brother, he has revealed to me that he was worshiping the devil, and satanism, while he was here living at the home, which was something that I was not aware of. INTERVIEWER: During the time that this home has been here, there was many different times where different members of your family occupied this house? Yes. INTERVIEWER: During that time, I believe you had told me about an aunt and a cousin, and that they had practiced witchcraft. How long were they here for? They were here at two different times. The first time they were here, I was around 18-19 years old, and they had just moved back to the area, and needed a place to stay, and with as large as the house was, my dad allowed them to come and stay here. She had made comments before about casting a spell on the earth outside, so that the basement didn't flood, and stuff like that. So who knows what they did? So I feel that that kind of desecrated this property. It's kind of ironic that seven years ago, I happened to run across the producers of this documentary. I was working for a different agency in Saginaw County. My patrol area was actually the stable, and it was a late-night shift, and I was making my way down Hamilton Street, and I saw a bunch of people in dark clothes with flashlights inside the stable. I thought there was a burglary in progress, so I started doing my police thing, and ended up getting Steve Shippy, and here we are seven years later, and it's just kind of ironic and coincidental that he's in my office right now, and he's still doing this. My name's Nate House, I'm a Lieutenant with the Essexville Public Safety Department, and I've been in public safety for 17 years, and I grew up here in the city of Essexville. When I was growing up in town here, I think that most people my age were well aware of the rumors, and the lore that surrounded this place, but it never really seemed like a whole lot of people wanted to go up to the house and kick over rocks. The rumors were always there. Walking through the yard, people sneaking out and going through the fields, and stuff like that. They would claim that they got chased by something that wasn't there. People driving by the house would claim that they saw lights inside, like a flashlight shining at the ceiling, or like an oil lantern, or some type of light moving from window to window. In high school there was this kind of different guy in one of my classes, and he brought in this really hold black and white photo that he said was from the house, and it was a picture of a guy in a coffin. I remember thinking that's really weird. When I moved away, I really hadn't given this place much thought. I didn't really give it much thought until I moved back, and it only came back into the spotlight after a friend of mine, who was a pretty prominent guy in the community went out to the house to help the resident move her belongings out, because, as he aptly put it, something that she couldn't see chased her out of there. He didn't really elaborate about it very much, and I didn't ask a lot of questions, besides, which house was it? And when he told me, it was kind of like oh, yeah that makes sense, and kind of like, is that still a thing? Being back in the community, and maybe being a little more objective and older, or maybe, maybe my position and my career, where it's my job to make sense of the things that don't make a lot of sense, and to put the pieces of the puzzle together, I think, reasonably, sure, if there was a handful of incidences that happened over there, maybe 12 occurrences, yeah I could probably find a way to explain those things, in a way that we could all get behind in our stand. But when you have this many reported incidences, with this many people from all different backgrounds, over 10 decades worth of time, how do you explain that? INTERVIEWER: You know this house to us is basically a powder keg of so many things. You've got over 100 bodies brought in there for funerals. You've got over a dozen confirmed deaths in the house, and on the property, rumored to be more. Now you bring into the mix, occult practice, Satanism, witchcraft, scary stuff. How does this place affect you or the prospect of going here? You know, I'm cautiously optimistic. I think there's obviously an element of skepticism that always exists, just based on the fact that I want the facts. I mean, obviously, the fact that there's so much history, and so much lore, and so much surrounding this place, anybody in their right mind would have to wonder what's going on. It's certainly in the forefront of your mind, if anything else. It's a big old house, there's no doubt about that. People who come out here, whether they actually had experiences or not, I don't know, but something left them awfully terrified. Man this place is giving me the absolute creeps, before I even get in there. I feel like I'm having like an anxiety attack before I even get there. I gotta stop for a minute, and kind of pull myself together. You know, for some reason, my heart is racing, I'm nervous, it's just really making me flake out a little bit before I even get here. I can't even imagine what I'm getting ready to walk into. All right, let's do this. Here it is. We thought that we visited the hell home before, this is like walking into hell. As I came into this house, total high anxiety, total craziness, total apprehension, almost feeling very overwhelmed. But when I come in here I can feel very peaceful, I can feel very neutral, I feel very businesslike, or that I can discuss a lot of different things that's going on, or kind of like, everybody's very neutral on the same ground. This man makes me feel like he was absolutely devastated. He makes feel like there was a world of sadness, and it's almost like, out went the lights. It feels like I'm done, I'm outta here, I can't deal with this anymore, and he makes me feel like he just kind of snuffed life out. INTERVIEWER: Well this man, Luke, actually committed suicide in this house, using a rifle. So your feelings would be exactly correct. And he makes me feel like the rug was pulled out from under his feet, like his world was just completely shut down. When Luke was overseas in the war, he had met a woman, and fell in love really deeply, and when he returned. He said it's a complete illusion. She left him and married somebody else. And she had been baiting him all along. And as long as he was gone, she was able to keep up that game, that ruse, and then when he came home, it was a little too close for comfort, and she finally had to tell him, I'm sorry, I just can't keep this up any longer. What the hell is this? This is probably the most craziest picture that I can ever imagine. And that's this house in the background, correct? CAMERAMAN: Absolutely is, yep. I don't understand what this dark entity is, that's in this photo, and the girl that's in the photo looks very disturbed to me. And I don't want to use the word that she's possessed, but it almost feels like that she's got something else that's going on, like she's not 100% there, but there's something else that's kind of captivating her. I'm really kind of freaked out by what this dark cloud is. CAMERAMAN: This is exactly what the owner of the home, currently, Rebecca, was describing that when she was a kid she would see these dark masses in the bedroom, in the corner, and she would even say that when cars would go by, it would light up the room, but it wouldn't light up this corner where this was. This has got me really concerned. This is an old photos, so this is something that's been going on for a long, long time. I don't know how the family had all that energy going on here, because there's a lot of spirits here. There are still a lot of souls that are here, that are still attached to this place. It's seen so much life, but yet this house has seen so much death, as well. What is that growling? FILMMAKER: You guys here that? MAN: Yeah. KELLY: He doesn't like that. FILMMAKER: Hello? (SHUTTER CLICKING) Can you say that again? So he's trying to take control, and he's trying to show everyone that this is his house now. Now, when you say he, you're referring to the voice that we heard? Yeah, yeah, he's not very happy, he's not a very nice spirit at all. Do you feel that we're in any kind of danger, with what you're feeling from this male? Absolutely. I would say that if he has it his way, he wants everybody out of this place right now. I'm good. What's that? I'm good. I'm good, that's enough for me. FILMMAKER: Is there something wrong with the equipment? No no no, this all going good, but I, I came here to run sound, not this. This sound's just coming out of the walls, that's not, that's not what I came here for, so no, no I mean, I appreciate it, but no. You want the hoodie back? Something? No. I don't. Is there anything we could do to? No, no. This is just not my cup of tea, not what I came here for. FILMMAKER: At this point, shall we continue to go room to room? Or shall we just go down into that basement, and try to confront it? I think that as much as I don't want to, I think we need to just go down there and just do it. Rebecca's sister, when we interviewed her, that last words that she said to us, was be careful, be careful. Don't tell me you all didn't hear that. I heard it. Let's go downstairs, that's it. You guys ready? KELLY: I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. Honest to God, it feels as if this floor wants to give way, and totally suck you in. That banging came from down this way. Oh my God. Oh man, I sure don't want to go back there. Oh my God, there's a growling that going on. FILMMAKER: It's coming from back here. It sounded like a guttural kind of a growl. KELLY: And it's breathing. Who are you? What are you? Oh my God. This is unbelievable. So this is why it will not allow anything happy, and anything positive, because it thrives on the anger, the bitterness, the hatred. FILMMAKER: Do you believe that it was summoned? Yes? FILMMAKER: In this room? Yes. FILMMAKER: That goes perfectly in line with the information that we have. What do you want with this family? What do you want with this home? Quit going from room to room. If you're that powerful, give us a sign, right now. Go ahead, I heard that. Go ahead and make the sound again. We're waiting for you. FILMMAKER: I keep hearing something down there. I just saw a shadow in there. FILMMAKER: Down here? Yes. Kelly, whereabouts did you see the shadow? KELLY: I just saw it, almost like it was peeking, right where this stack is. What the hell was that? It just walked right past you. You want to push me? KELLY: I just saw it, almost like it was peeking, right where this stack is. Stack is. FILMMAKER: That's it? Just push somebody and run away? There's something right there. Definitely, there's something right here. You in there? You gonna hide in there? I don't know why, but that just enraged me. I've really never gotten mad, ever, while investigating. But that pissed me off. It wants pissed. It wants anger. That's how it grows stronger, and that's how it gains control. All I can say is, be careful with this one. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (EERIE SCREECHING) (FAINT MUSIC PLAYING) (SHOW MUSIC PLAYING) There's nothing, this way. Oh yeah. Check the door jamb too. I can see or hear of it. Someone definitely tried to break this door in. You can see the cracks and the splinters down the side here of this door. Oh yeah, there's only one thing that could really damage this kind metal, and make these marks like this, these circular marks, I'm thinking it's probably like a single-handed sledge hammer, or something like that. They had to have made entry for sure. FILMMAKER: How bizarre do you guys think it is, that somebody made entry but didn't take anything? How common is something like that? You get a lot of kids that come in, and they like to mess around, but they'll destroy stuff. If they get in, they'll break the chairs, or they'll break more windows, they're not just gonna come in and walk around and leave. FILMMAKER: And do nothing? If they came in, they did something, or something spooked them, and they ran off. It's one or the other. Because nothing was done inside the house. But they had to have made entry, there's no doubt in my mind, because the location of where they hit it, and that's pretty much the sweet spot where you'd want to break open a door. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So I've been doing this for approximately 10 years. I started as just doing Tarot readings for fun. But after that I just dabbled a little bit into automatic writing, which for me was just more comfortable, more personal. I just felt like you got better information, doing automatic writing. I'm not too familiar with that. How does that process work exactly? For me, I would have a client sit across from the desk, then I sit there, hold their hands, get their energy, and then just start writing. If you were wanting to do this automatic writing here in the house, how would you do that? I would just walk around, just write down whatever comes to my mind. Forgive me for saying, but you really seem nervous. Are you sensing something that you're not wanting to talk about? You know, I just keep getting called to different areas, and it's kind of making me feel a little anxious, because I feel like they really want me to go. I kind of feel like, they think I'm gonna help them. It's me, I'm here to help. It's Christin Marie. I feel this energy in here, like you were punished in here. Were you sent here for punishment? It's very, almost like a nauseous feeling in here. Something, nauseous, sweat, faint, lay down. Did you lay down on this floor? Oh my God, I am like sweating all over the floor. Like all of a sudden, I just feel like, oh my God. Like my face is super-glossy. FILMMAKER: Adam, put your hand right here. It's really hot, you can feel it. It got immediately hot. Why are you making us hot? Is that how you felt? FILMMAKER: Where you burned? I'm literally sweating. I'm sweeting profusely. I can't sit in there. ADAM: I feel I'm gonna throw up right now. Exactly. Get this on camera. Look at my hand. I don't know if I can get that or not, but I literally can't sit in this room. Another second. I don't know if I can get that or not, but I literally can't sit in this room. Another second. It's like, it's hard to breathe. Yeah, it's extremely hard to breathe. It's awful. And I think that's the point he's trying to make. Do you believe that somebody was harmed? It's awful, and I think that's the point he's trying to make. The point he's trying to make. Do you believe that somebody was harmed? Yes. I'd have to look back at this. I don't recall what questions you were asking, when I channel, I don't really I don't hear with my ears, I try to hear with my mind. (BEEPING) Throw up, stench, stuck in here, punish me. Ouch, pulled me, unstuck. Got in trouble. Over, oh I saw him, a little boy with like knickers, and like the short overalls with the socks pulled up to here, and like the shoes, but he's burning up and he's sitting like this. Like in this spot cramping. And that's when I saw him, is when I can smell like. So he would have been up against this wall? Yeah. And that's exactly where I thought something was behind me when I turned around. It's almost like it went unnoticed. Oh my God. I felt this, I can't stay here, like I'm really like feeling very frightened. Okay. FILMMAKER: Did you have him in here recording? CHRISTIN: Yes. FILMMAKER: Christin, when you first entered the home, you had saw somebody here in this stairwell, going down the stairs. Yes. FILMMAKER: Did you have any specifics, or is there anything you can tell us about who that may have been? The half man morpher. FILMMAKER: Do you want to like try to uh? I think that's why I'm feeling sick right now, 'cause usually when it's a spirit that is just, well a spirit can make you sick through how they felt, when they were going through a situation, or usually when you're in the presence of a negative energy, you can feel very sick. FILMMAKER: Do you think it's possible that it could be an inhuman? Well what do you mean by inhuman? Well, the reason I ask that is, we've caught an image on video, of what looks like sort of an animal running across the cellar floor, and it seems to be on all fours. This is exactly what I'm seeing now. That's exactly what I saw. So do I feel inhuman? I would say I don't think it's a human form, I feel extremely, extremely uncomfortable right now, even talking about it. Like, very uncomfortable. And I feel like it's kind of like the master of down here, with all this stuff. FILMMAKER: Were you conjured to be in this home? Did something bring you into this house? Yes. But it was actually outside, before. And was not a problem, until it was welcomed in. FILMMAKER: When you say it was welcomed into the house. It was asked to come in. FILMMAKER: Okay. Is there any way we can find out who did it? Woman-man, woman-man, woman-man, woman-man. I feel like the letter J or an O. I almost feel like there's two people though. They wanted to dabble in something that they didn't know really completely about. FILMMAKER: What's its purpose in the house now? Did you hear that? Yeah. FILMMAKER: It's like a rumbling. Purpose in the house. I can't tell you. FILMMAKER: What will it take for it to leave the house? Everyone to leave. It's getting so angry. Stop asking questions. Like, it wanted me to pound on the wall, really hard, when you asked that, and just scream and be like, stop asking questions, stop asking questions. But it's not like, English. Like it's weird, and like, it's definitely something else. I don't want to say like Latin maybe, or something like that. FILMMAKER: Well, we don't have to ask any more questions. If there's anything that wants to be said, it can be. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. It's like, just like rage, just like anger and rage. It's very negative. FILMMAKER: Well, I don't feel that we're gonna subscribe to that. Let's go ahead and end this investigation here. Good. FILMMAKER: Let's not give it a form. Yep. That's a fantastic idea. My overall vibe is that it would for me, if I had to live here, it would not be comfortable. I don't know how anybody could live here to be honest. It's just, there's just too much going on, especially in that basement. FILMMAKER: When you were doing the automatic writing, or trying to, on the stairwell, you said that it began to speak with awful profanity, and rage. Why do you think that was? Probably because we're here and we're asking and talking about it. It likes to kind of be elusive, in a way I think, but it just does not want people here, it does not want people talking about it. It's just angry. FILMMAKER: It doesn't want its presence to be brought to light. It doesn't want to be talked about, or known about. And you think that's why it pretty much hides in the darkness, down there? Yes. FILMMAKER: When you say that it was welcomed in this house, how does that happen? Is it a ritual, or what is it? Could be a ritual, could be kind of like a seance, kind of like how some people pray for angels to come. Some people can continually ask for negative energies to come, or sometimes people who are going through a traumatic period in their life, who focus on negative thoughts and energy, can welcome that in as well, but I feel like I said this one was more ritualistic. FILMMAKER: When you encountered that spirit in the stairwell, your whole demeanor changed, you could see physically you kind of jerked back, and we were very concerned for you at that point. What exactly did you see, and/or feel? Well, with strong energy, you feel sick, and body pains, nausea and anger, and rage. FILMMAKER: If I told you that the owner of the house, the current owner of the property, her and her husband would go downstairs to talk, and they would often end up arguing. They would reach the point of rage, and sometimes seem semi-uncontrollable, when they would go down there. Do you think that what's down in the basement could have contributed to this? Absolutely. It's almost like, not a full-on possession. You give him a little fight to cause a little bit of anger, and that feeds it, and it feeds it, and it can keep feeding it until even people who normally have a good relationship, end up in a physically abusive relationship. It can definitely feed that energy. I've seen it happen. And I think that if they stay in this home, without some sort of resolution, things could go really poorly. FILMMAKER: In your opinion, should anybody be living in this home? No. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SNAPPING) FILMMAKER: You guys okay up there? Yep. FILMMAKER: All right Jamie, I'm gonna go ahead and begin this EVP so I should know. My name is Steve. You and I communicated just the other day, when I was here with Christin. Christin felt that you were hurt in this room, and from all the different pages here, there are several words and phrases, that would suggest that you were indeed harmed in this spot. Please tell us who hurt you, and why. I can see that at one time there was indeed a door on this closet. Were you maybe locked in here? Something's moving around up here. STEVE: What's happening? I'm not sure. STEVE: What's going on up there. JAMIE: Something just poked me in the back. STEVE: Try to communicate. JAMIE: Why did you just poke me in the back? STEVE: Jamie? Yeah. STEVE: Ask what 1908 means. JAMIE: Do you know what 1908 means? (THUMPING) STEVE: I keep seeing the phrase, got in trouble, got in trouble. What did you do to get in trouble? Sounded like it came from over here. STEVE: What do you mean by 1908? Is that the year that you were born? Steve? STEVE: What's up? JAMIE: Look what we found up there. STEVE: What is that? A very old baseball. STEVE: A ball? Yeah. STEVE: Hold on, hold on to that. STEVE: Oh, it says ball here. She wrote down "ball" two times. Here, drop it down to me. Is this your ball? STEVE: Do you want to come get it back? Is this your ball? STEVE: It's right here. We can roll it back and forth. Play a game? If you could roll that ball for me, I'll try and catch it over here on my side. Can you do that? Please don't be afraid. No one's gonna hurt you here, I can promise you that. JAMIE: Oh my God. STEVE: No one's gonna hurt you here, I can promise you that. JAMIE: Oh my God. STEVE: Was that a voice? It sounded like laughing. STEVE: Get a name. What's your name? STEVE: How did they die? Was it in this house? How did you die? How did you die? (OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) But it's not like, English. Like it's weird, and like, it's definitely something else. Hi, I'm Julie, I'm from Frankenmuth, Michigan. I lived in Germany for 15 years, and I'm here tonight to help translate into German. I was from (FOREIGN WORDS). We lived there from the time I was a baby until I was 15 years old. STEVE: What was going through your mind when you started pulling up the driveway, and you saw the home tonight for the first time? What went through your head? Well first off, it's dark, and the house looks creepy. Pulling up, I felt sort of scared. I had more friends telling me not to do this, because they are worried that something bad will attach itself to me, and I will bring that home. Then I had a few people telling me, oh this is really cool, this is a great experience. You will be able to see if all this is real. I just want to know that there is something out there, and that there is an afterlife. Okay, I guess with that being said, would you like to begin? Yes, let's get started. Okay. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Rebecca's daughter told us about an incident, while she was lying in bed, and she heard a tapping at the window. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) While the tapping was happening, the blanket was pulled over her head tightly, to where she couldn't move. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Whoever is responsible for terrorizing this child, this family, identify yourself now. Come forward. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Quit doing cowardly things, like picking on children. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Quit doing cowardly things, like pulling people's hair. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Who the hell are you? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What is your name? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Did you just feel something? Yeah, I just felt that dizzy feeling again. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Happened again, didn't it? Yeah. There's something right over here. That string right there moved a little bit, too. And you didn't touch it. I feel completely normal right here. Why do you seem to only want to hurt women or children? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Answer me. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Feel how cold it is over here. Stick your hand here. Is this where you stand at night? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Rebecca's daughter said she would hear footsteps coming up the stairs, and stopping right here, by her bed. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) She laid in this bed many nights, afraid to sleep. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) This affected her school and her life. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Do you have any remorse or empathy for what you've done to this family? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (TAPPING) (TAPPING) (TAPPING) Standing against the wall I felt really weird and dizzy, and felt sadness in the room, and loneliness, and I had to step away from that wall to feel fine again. I heard a voice, I'm not sure if it was German or not. It just sounded like a male voice, like some sort of word, and right now I'm starting to feel a little bit dizzy again, and I never feel this way. STEVE: You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a little dizziness. STEVE: Maybe recap some of the questions you asked. Some of the questions I asked in German, was who was here, and it was mainly directly targeting Luke, asking him if he was here, and my mind just went completely blank, I'm sorry. STEVE: That's okay. I feel like I need to stand somewhere else. STEVE: Would you like to sit down? Yeah. That feels better. STEVE: What's happening in this house is really physically affecting you, isn't it? Yeah, yeah I feel really strange. STEVE: Wow, brand new battery. MAN: There we go. STEVE: Completely died, right when you asked if you could sit down. Maybe something's like draining... STEVE: Oh I definitely think so. I watched your demeanor, I watched it happen to you. And just when this happened to you, and you needed to sit down, my battery just went from 75% to zero. MAN: To nothin'. I'm going to ask if he doesn't like women. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I feel like, like my arm feels like it's being like grabbed, but not hard, but just grabbed. STEVE: Luke, is that you? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Whoever you are, this is unacceptable. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Julie is a guest in this house. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And regardless, you have no right to touch anybody here. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Acknowledge please. Let us know that you understand me. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Why are you so angry? Why are you so hateful? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Why do you keep preying on women and children? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Identify yourself. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 'Cause we're not gonna leave until you do. I can promise you that. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And I don't care how long it takes. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And I don't care how many more people quit. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) And I don't care what you do to me. What if he thinks that I'm the one that's targeting him, because I'm translating? STEVE: I'm the one that's speaking to you, not Julie. If you're gonna grab somebody, grab me. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Point right at me. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I'm the one calling you a coward. I'm the one that thinks you're disgusting, because of what you do, and what you've been doing. You're gonna leave this house. I don't care what I have to do. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Would you like to communicate with us? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (MUMBLING) Is that you? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Come toward the sound of our voice. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Do not be afraid. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What is keeping you in this home? Do you feel forced to be here? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Or do you choose to be here? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) We can hear you, we hear you walking around up there. We hear you on the stairs, we've heard your knocking. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DISEMBODIED VOICE) I heard something. I heard something a little bit. (DISEMBODIED VOICE) (DISEMBODIED VOICE) Ask them to come down the stairs. Tell 'em to come down. Don't be afraid. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) There's nothing to fear here. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) We just want the family to quit being terrified, and scared. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Do they have any kind of message for us? Why are they doing this? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DISEMBODIED VOICE) What was that? What was that? JAMIE: It sounded like a weird voice up there or something. My God, I heard barking, growling, like it was an animal. It sounded like a different language almost. Are you all right? What did you say to her? It wasn't words, it wasn't words, it was like an animal noise. Something's mad, I could feel it, something is like really mad up there. I could feel it. Oh my God. Whatever's in this house, there's something that's not good here. I can't finish, I can't, I can't. I cannot finish. You don't have to. That was so scary. I was so scared. And you didn't understand any words? It wasn't words, I can say that with certainty. It was not words, it was like a bark, like a growl, like an animal. It was like an animal. It was like it didn't want you upstairs? Like it was trying to get me to come back down. You know, that's why I like ran. You guys all heard it though, right? Yeah, we heard it for sure. It was really loud. We have several cameras, I mean we have at least six cameras, seven cameras running audio in all directions. Can you play it? Yeah, we'll play it right now. You all right? I should not have went over there. That's all right, let's go. What if I stand over there by the stairs? STEVE: Ask it to come down the stairs, tell him to come down. Don't be afraid. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) STEVE: There's nothing to fear here. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) STEVE: We just want the family to quit being terrified, and scared. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) STEVE: Do they have any kind of message for us? Why are you doing this? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DISEMBODIED SOUNDS) That's the message, that's the message. STEVE: We just want the family to quit being terrified, and scared. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Do they have any kind of message for us? Why are they doing this? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GROWLING) Oh my God. The old growler. STEVE: You still have tears in your eyes. Every time you hear it? Well it understands German. It does, because it was right after I said, do you have a message for us? Do you have a message? I gotta leave this house. I gotta leave this house, I don't want to be here anymore. My name is TD McRoy. I'm the chief executive director for an independent research organization out of Orlando, Florida, called CPI Investigations. For the past 13 years, we have attempted to establish a link between particle physics, and the supernatural. Back in 2007, our research team created a powerful computer program called, the Iroquois Technology. The program has the ability to detect (MUFFLED) neutrinos hidden within film footage. We had looked at, and researched a lot of hauntings, from around the country, and we realized there was probably a direct correlation between physics and what people had been reporting. We're all born and raised to believe, and we're all told at very young ages, that ghosts are not real, that monsters are not real. And even though our eyes tell us that we're looking at something that most likely doesn't exist, what we were proving is that, Iroquois Technology was discovering human-like images hidden within film footage, basically, hidden to the human eye. I want to show you some of the things that we got. We just wanted to identify, and so let me go ahead and play it for you, and tell me if you remember seeing this when you were filming. So, right there. STEVE: Yeah, I see it right there. TD: I'll let it play through first, and then I'll take it back. It'll do it again, we get a closer view, and you can see it snaps out. That's the second time, that it pops its, we'll just call it a head, because we don't know what it is. But anyways, that was interesting. I definitely wanted to show you that one. Moved on, we also caught something in the parlor area. And so here is the door opening slowly. And you will see what looks to be the face of a gentleman, off in the back, and at the same time his hand, is here at the door. Now, if you go and look at a lot of different investigators' photographs, sometimes you will see, every now and then, you'll see like a purple streak somewhere. No one has ever seen an entire face. We just usually get an orb of a streak. This guy's face, and part of his hand are there. And the reason we think he's performed a quantum leap, or a quantum jump, is because his face, or his body, appears to be on the stairs there, but his hand is clearly opening the door at the same time. But there's no way he has elongated his arm to do that. Anybody would see that. So that means he was there at the steps, and at the door at the same time. That is a perfect definition of a quantum leap, or quantum jump. And what's amazing about that is when I filmed this walk-through, for you to test the technology, when that front door opened for me, I thought it was the wind. Because initially he reached towards the right, and the doorknob is actually on the left. On the left. And when the camera pans back slightly, the door is already opening. So yeah, I'll play it for you again, but you can see that he is over on the steps, but at the same time, his arm, or his hand, is actually opening the door. Look how far away he is. Right, and then this image, what we're seeing right here, this is before even the dynamic filtration. Absolutely. This is just my raw video, right here. And you can still see the face and the hand. We're not done with the parlor yet, because, I'm just gonna bring it up and you just tell me what you think. But this is what we found at the front door, while you were opening the door, just moments before the gentleman took over. And you can see, what appears to us as a woman who has long, dark hair, a full nose, she looks like maybe her lips may be swollen a little bit. Very long hair, but she looks like she's wearing a white gown. STEVE: With her hair parted in the middle. Would you say that she has a Native American, or Mexican, look to her? I would say that she definitely doesn't have a European look to her. Well, this is what you don't know. Rebecca's father, Rebecca's the woman that owns the home that we filmed this investigation in. Her father claimed that he was being taunted by a short woman, with long black hair, parted in the middle, wearing a white gown, that was speaking Spanish, or some type of language to him, and this was in the last few weeks of his life before he passed away in the home. That is absolutely incredible, that you caught this. You could never have known that. Nobody knows that, except for a handful of people that were present for the interviews. Wait a minute, so there was a gentleman that lived in this house, and there were reports of a woman that looked... Exactly, exactly like that. We have the interviews where his daughters, both of his daughters clearly state this. In fact, the gentleman that lived there, Rebecca's father, was seeing apparitions so real, that he actually fired a rifle in his house, at what he thought was an intruder, that was not an intruder, all the doors were locked. It was impossible for anybody to have been in the house. But specifically, he described this spirit. Listen, that's amazing, because the Iroquois Technology reads these images with bits of information, ones and zeros. That's all it's doing, that's just the basic computer. The computer doesn't know what you just described. Of course not yeah, I mean that's absolutely amazing. There's a little Mexican girl. She's coming up to me. She's talking Spanish to me, and then she runs off, and I told her, wait a minute, tell me what you said. And she runs and hides behind the door, and I go look behind the door and she's not there. Bill Gutzwiller, I work for Essexville Public Safety. I've been doing this job for 19 years. Called here to today, to give my opinion on some fire damage that occurred around the house, here. So, what I'm gonna try and do, is take a look at this, to see what caused it, number one, and number two, look at some confusing aspects of it, that were brought to my attention. So it appears, from what I understand, that the gutter from up here, came down onto the wiring, which in turn caused a spark on the ground, and caused a fire to ignite all the way around the house, from the wire that came down. So, as we step over here, I can definitely see the gutter on the ground, and as I'm looking on the ground, I can definitely tell that there's some charring, so there obviously was a flame that came through this area, and the gutter over here, you can definitely see, has burn marks to where at least it started melting. So but, on the ground, is where I can really see a lot of the char. So as I come over here, I notice one of the peaks had also come down, and as I look, it looks as though the flame definitely came through here, but this wood doesn't have any burn or charred marks on it at all. And with this old wood, I'm kind of boggled as to why it didn't, why it didn't burn. Because look over here. You can see right over here, that the flames continued, and caused the damage in the burning here, to the downspout. And again, looking at the wall here, I'm not seeing any damage at all, or burn marks on the house. I've never come across anything like this, no. (MATCH STRIKING) My name is Steve, and with me is my friend and colleague, Jamie. We've been here countless nights, reviewing footage, setting up our gear, but then it dawned on us how important it was to actually investigate this room. The current owner of the home had told us that three family members, her grandfather, her grandmother, and most recently, and tragically, her father, passed away right where Jamie is seated right now. That's a lot of tragedy for four walls. For one room. Anyone who may be in this room, anybody out there, please come toward the sound of my voice. Come toward the light. Did you happen to pass in this room? Have you ever lived in this home? Or perhaps worked this farm, worked on the land? If you're trying to communicate with us, and we don't hear you, and you're potentially getting aggravated or upset, we apologize. We will be reviewing the audio, and we will be listening very carefully to see if in fact you've tried to respond. As I'm sitting here at this desk, my eyes keep looking this way. I get the chills when I think about that incident, Rebecca's father, living here alone, scared, seeing apparitions, objects moving on their own, and a whole slough of things that would surely terrify anybody, especially somebody in this huge house all by themselves, all alone. Seeing something so horrifying, they would actually get their firearm out of the cabinet that was once here, and firing a bullet at whatever they had seen. I've been doing this for quite some time. I've read a lot of stories, reviewed a lot of cases, and watched a whole lot of investigations, and I've never heard of anybody being so terrified that they would actually pull a trigger. That's upstairs, let's go. Come on. It sounded like walking. The chair, the rocking chair. Get it! Who's up here with us? My heart's pounding. You were trying to get our attention up here? Open that closet. Who are you? Luke? That was incredible. Look at this. This are all individual impact hits. There's got to be a dozen of them, check the ground. There's probably a rock or a brick or something around here. All right, check all your windows. Let's check your tires too. JAMIE: There's a ton of glass in there. STEVE: Watch your hand, don't get cut on anything. JAMIE: The road case. STEVE: My God, you guys left the IR cameras in here. There weren't here to steal obviously, were they? Just here to damage it. Nobody would go through a windshield to steal, anyway. JAMIE: I can't even believe this. I can believe it, between the break-in, between all the other things we're experiencing, seeing people coming up to the house at night. All these weird cars pulling in and pulling out of the driveway. It's not just the paranormal that we have to worry about. So from now on, all you guys, nobody goes outside alone, okay? At all. JAMIE: I'm sick of this house. Check your other tire. All we've tried to do is help this family. And with all the internal fighting they have going on, it makes you wonder who did this. Somebody's trying to impede this investigation. Somebody's trying to stop us from finishing this job. Either they're trying to cover something, or they don't want us to uncover something. Come on. Don't worry about it, whatever it costs, we'll replace it. One thing that was bugging me was the whole door break-in. It didn't really dawn on me till thinking to myself one day, why would this door be booted in, but none of this expensive equipment or anything in this house be disturbed? And none of your equipment was taken? None of it was touched, vandalized, stolen, nothing. The only rational explanation is there's something else that person wanted, inside the house. Did they break in to take something from the house, that we weren't aware is here? The other thing that really had us concerned is, did they break in to put something in the house? I mean have you guys searched the house at all? Initially, frantically, just making sure that our gear and our cameras were okay and everything, but nothing really beyond the scope of that. So like, main floors, top floor and everything you were searching? What about the basement? We didn't really search the basement, because at the time we had no gear down there. Primarily, we had it all in the common area. The basement, probably is a good spot to look. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Okay, Steve we were talking about the shakedown of the jail cell. What we normally do, is start from one corner, and then work our way 360 degrees around. Who knows what we're gonna get our hands on so, we'll put these on, and I'll start from here. For example, from right here. Is it hollow, is it not? So there's nothing behind here, it sounds pretty solid. There's nothing out of place. I go up and down the wall. This one feels loose. Okay, can we move this? STEVE: Yeah, sure. I'm gonna put these bottles right here. One, two, three. Oh yeah. You got a light there. STEVE: Oh wow. I want to go Richter this first, but like, if you overlook anything, you're gonna miss something, so I'm gonna start with this, because if I go to this, I'm gonna forget about this. So that's why we do the 360 degrees so. What in the? It's like a drawer, but there's nothing in there. It's just all dust and wood. That's an intentional drawer, like a hiding spot. Okay Steve, take that wall and just start from the bottom. Go up and down it, just all around, check cracks and crevasses. STEVE: So we just split walls? Yeah, we just split walls and then just meet around like, like let's say you get done faster than me, you'd be over there, and I'd meet you right there. So I guess we'll keep, I'm gonna start right here. So like down here, we've got like a little vent or something, maybe for a wood stove. That'd be another great place to hide something. I'm just trying to figure out, if we got a tool to open it, like a screwdriver, do we have a screwdriver down here? We've got a knife over here. Yeah, I want to (MUFFLED) this one. That's obviously full of dust and dirt. Hey, I literally just opened this. What in the world, looks like a trading card. STEVE: What is that? It's definitely a Tarot card, but that's a different language. That thing looks like it's been closed for, I had to beat it with the back of this knife. STEVE: To even get it open. To get it open, so it's been down for quite some time, years I would say. Where to even start. Let's start from the bottom, let's go up and down, up and down, and check all the obvious spots. I'm gonna go under here. Oh, it's frickin' dusty down here, that's for sure. Oh, hey, Steve? Oh right down here, what is this? Can we go in another room, where it's better crowded? Okay, I'm just gonna go on record and say I have nothing to do with this, I'm just searching. So, I don't know what this is. The sacrament. STEVE: Look how old this book is. MAN: Muerte. Muerte. Muerte. All right, we're gonna skip over that. I say we set that there, just leave it there, and we'll I guess deal with it later. We all know you're there, we're all very aware that you're here in this house. We need some questions answered. Number one, who are you? Number two, we want to know why you're here. We want to know if you're stuck here, if there's something that won't let you leave. Or do you want to be here? This house is beautiful. Is it yours? STEVE: I am down here tonight, alone, with the sole purpose of communicating with whatever inhabits this home, this portion of the home. I just saw you in the closet. I'm going up. I just saw it. I just saw you in here. Why this room, why this closet? Is this your room? STEVE: What is your name? Do you even have a name? How long have you been down here? And why do you stay here? How long have you been down here? How long have you been down here? Are you the reason that it's this cold in this room? JAMIE: Oh, what was that, downstairs? You want me to go back downstairs. (MUFFLED CONVERSATION) STEVE: Please, if you are a person, a soul, something with a name, someone with an identity, you must tell me who you are, and if you are not, and you truly are an inhuman, how did you come to be in this home? Who conjured you? Why did you draw us back down here? But I saw you up there, I came up to talk to you, and always, always, once we get up there to talk to you, back down here we go. STEVE: We know there were dark arts practiced in this home, and we don't know what kind, or to what caliber. You do not have the authority to inhabit or dwell on this farm, or in this house. (RINGING) How many of you are in this house? Can you knock on the wall for how many people are in this house? Besides the four of us that are walking down here. Can you just give me a number? Or is it too many to knock? STEVE: What are you? State your name. Who brought you into this home? You have no choice but to reveal what you are? (SQUEAKING) Who are you? What do you want with me, and my team? (PIANO PLAYING) (OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So Steve we wanted to brief you on a lot of different things, not only just the paranormal activity that we've already encountered here as a team, but also the officers have had many experiences on their own, so why don't you fill him in on the urban legends, and whatnot of this home? Right, so I grew up in this town. It's a small town in Michigan, and this is one of those places that always had a lot of lore that surrounded it. A lot of the people that I went to school with, had always talked about this place being rumored as being haunted and things like that. A lot of the people that I knew had come out here, and they claimed that they had experiences. In high school, there was a guy in my grade. We were in a class, and he brought in this really old black and white photo, and being in here now, I recognize it as being in that room, but it was of somebody laying in a casket. And then that kind of just perpetuated the lore, and the urban legend, and the myth, surrounding that place. When you have this many instances of reoccurring phenomena, or claims of such, by this many people over this period of time, it certainly lends credibility, or at least evidence, to the fact that by definition, that something paranormal is happening. Did you ever see any, or recognize any patterns in the reports, that made you sort of go, okay it's cool that these people are saying this, or anything that made you go this could have credibility, because of these patterns I'm recognizing, that sort of thing? That's a really good question, and yeah, the thing is that there was always the fabled rumors and lore about people getting chased in the yard, feeling that there's something there and there wasn't. People would drive by and claim that they would see lights going from window to window at night. I mean it's super-cool that three gentlemen with clearly level heads, to even look at this as something potentially paranormal. By definition, there's something certainly abnormal, if not paranormal, by the literal definition. Saying that, this area in particular, we rarely get calls anywhere near this area. In certain jurisdictions, police departments, you have certain hotspots, regulars, whatnot. And ever since they started doing their investigation here, we've had three, four, maybe five, different instances where something happened here, where police or fire had to respond. So they had asked me to come down just for my opinion on a fire that had occurred here. It looked pretty obvious and apparent that a gutter came down on a power line, and basically started a brush fire around the house. You could literally see to where it was like a ring, that went around the house, and the strange part about it too, is that even at the places where it was closest to the house, there was like no damage to the house whatsoever. This doesn't happen on our watch. We've never had an incidence where we had to call the police for any reason, or had any property damage, or had anything like that happen. Since we've been here, it's been numerous times. Do you think maybe you're stirring stuff up, or do you think maybe you're just drawing more attention to the house? If I had to kind of theorize about that, I would say that it seems to me that when Rebecca and her family moved out of this house, or should I say, fled from this house, I feel that whatever's here is not happy with that. And I know it sounds very strange, but I do feel that whatever's here has some kind of tie to Rebecca. We were interviewing Rebecca when we first came here, that's kind of what we do is conduct the interviews first, gather as much information as we can. And we were interviewing her in the dining room, and as you know this house is strange in the sense that the main floor, which is where we are now, is about 15 steps up. So while she's speaking to us, she had a phone call come in, and you know, sometimes you have to stop an interview. It was one of her children, and we're sitting there waiting, and while this is happening, you hear two distinct breaths, huge breaths, and then, knock knock knock, right next to her ear on the window. She looks like this, goes back to her phone call, and afterward we said, yeah, that was something wasn't it, that knock? That was crazy. She said, what knock? She didn't hear it? And we said, well the knock on the window, remember, a few minutes ago? Oh, I didn't hear anything. So we thought, wow that's strange. And then we went back and looked at the footage, and you see her talking, and then you see her, suddenly look right at the window, and then it knocks. All right. Well, I'm still at the farm. (KNOCKING) Do you think there's a human spirit here that is mad that she's left the house, is that what you're saying? Like somebody in her family? No, I don't think it's a human spirit only because, everybody that is here for too long, starts to have issues. People, tempers flare for no reason. I mean let's be honest, all of you guys seriously, right now, with all of these guys here, like right now we feel good, all of these people here. When there's new people here, more people here, things are okay. When you get down to three, two, and of course by yourself, it's a whole different planet here. That goes back to where I stand on it is, it's not, as a lot of cops tell you, it's not what you know, it's what you can believe. And yeah, there's coincidences. I can tell you, having gone through this home, there's no speaker, there's no magnets, there's no trickery, there's no nothing. I'm putting my credibility with that, this is not fun house mirror effect here. My name's Steve Gonsalves, I'm a paranormal investigator. I've been doing it for about 25 years. I try to disprove hauntings. I try to figure out what could be a normal explanation, something happening organically or just naturally in the environment. If I'm not able to disprove these things, I start to look at the potential that it could be something paranormal. Listening to everybody's stories, the police officers, and the other investigators that are here, there's no doubt in my mind that they do believe that something is happening here. I had the police officer look right at me and say, I didn't believe in this stuff, but I heard voices and dragging and footsteps up the stairs, and I went and checked it out and there's nobody there, I don't know how to explain that. They're not making things up. They don't care if it's haunted, not haunted, they don't care at all, they just know that there are things happening here that can't be explained. Does that mean it's a ghost? Not sure. Does that mean it's a demon? I don't think so, but that's why we're investigating. If we already knew, we wouldn't have to investigate. The answers would just be there, so that's the fun. Being an investigator is figuring these things out. Whether it's a ghost or not, you just want to get to the truth, and how you get there is through an investigation. Since you've been here investigating, are there any places in the house that you sort of feel that there might be something else, where you just kind of get that feeling? We kind of get that feeling in general overall, but when we're in this office, and we're setting up, and we're doing the command center type of things, getting our gear packed, over here we do hear what sounds like footsteps. And more than once when people were sitting here on this couch, they felt as if something kind of nudged it or pushed it, and there's nobody here. Okay. So, and then of course right there is where the bullet was fired by Rebecca's father when he thought, you know. And that to me is incredible. I still think about that constantly, who would fire a gun in their house, and really believe that something is attacking them enough to discharge a firearm. I mean, he was 100% sure that there was an intruder in his house? Absolutely. There was no doubt in his mind that somebody was in his house, and he didn't want them there? He was ready to kill. Exactly, exactly, he was shooting his gun off. When he realized there was no one there, he must have been like, what am I doing? Like I'm shooting up my house. If it wasn't a person that he thought he was seeing, what the heck? What was it? Do you think that, what if it wasn't a person he saw, what if it was? Something else. Something else? A black mass, or I don't ever want to say, demon, but something that he couldn't wrap his head around. Enough to make him shoot. How does it end up in a place like this? What brings an inhuman to a home? Well, if you look at the lore behind such things, it doesn't like us humans, it doesn't want us on Earth, and it's going to go after people who are already a little bit traumatized in their brain. Exactly, weakened. It's just like, if you're an animal, you're gonna go after the limping one in the back, that's the easy kill, and you know you're gonna get to eat that day, that sort of thing. Supposedly if you believe in all of that, they're everywhere, they're all over the place. They can't always get to us, but they're always trying to, and perhaps this one made it, I don't know. Rebecca's sister said he was begging at the end for people to move in with him, any of the siblings. (BANGING) What the F...? That's it. Rebecca's sister said he was begging at the end, for people to move in with him, any of the siblings. (THUMPING) They said that he was basically, Rebecca's sister said he was begging at the end, for people to move in with him, any of the siblings. (THUMPING) That's it. That's it. That's it. STEVE: There was a loud, that was a loud bang, followed by a little bit of a dragging sound. I heard it, we all heard it, I mean these guys almost shit their pants. No offense. STEVE: And a voice. And a voice, I didn't hear a voice, but I'd like to. Hello? Hello? My name's Steve. We think we just heard you up here. Camera. Why did it die? Who's in here with us? Is this your house? Are we in your house? That was crazy, that was loud. It was very loud, but that's what we keep hearing. It's either knocks in threes, or big bangs. This is the spot where Luke took his life. He was standing right here, and he killed himself with a rifle. And this is where the bullet lodged. Oh my gosh, okay. And his body was found right here. Rebecca's dad was traumatized by this, because he walked in the house, right as he pulled the trigger, and as a child. Oh, so sad. Luke, we're really trying to figure out who is in this house, and why. And if it's not Luke, who is it? Who is in here? Much colder in this room. What was that? There's not even something knocked over. No, and that's the thing. Every time we hear the bangs or the crashes, for months we'd come up here and really look around everywhere, because we'd be certain that we would find something, and there's nothing. I gotta be honest with you, my brain would always just say, the house is settling, it's a pop, it's a creak, it's that time of night where the wood is expanding or contracting but, there's no mistaking that that was a smash. Can anybody tell me what time it is? Three o'clock. I mean you're right, come on. How would I? And we just lost another camera. Right at three a.m. Another camera dies. This house is void of anything that's good. That's what it does. And I hate to sound drastic, but, when you've been here for four months. Yeah, it's a voice. You know, and I hate to sound drastic, but when you've been here for four months. When you've been here for four months. When you've been here for four months. Can you tell us who you are? So that we know who we're talking to? I mean it's kind of morbid but, I might want to read his obituary. Right, and strike that emotion? Maybe. It's a pretty nasty technique, you know but. Luke Schaefer, 75, died Saturday afternoon at his home at North Finn Road. Coroner John Carpis said Mister Schaefer died of a gunshot wound in the head, believed to have been self-inflicted. He had been ill for several years. Born February 20th, 1890, in Hampton Township, he was a retired farmer. Your funeral was at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. So surreal that back then when they would do these obituaries, they would go into that kind of detail, self-inflicted gunshot to the head. That could be grisly back then. Was he shell-shocked maybe from war? There has to be something. I think there had to have been something that happened, you know all of it, just kind of culminating together, I think when he came back. It seems like he just gave up. Just called it. Right. Luke, after you came back from the war, did you just spend time in your farm, did you kind of just distance yourself from everybody? Who else is in here? If you're not Luke, can you let us know? (KNOCKING) I mean that... Was that you? No. Fuck no, dude. Are you sure? I'm positive. That came from right here. What were we saying, what was it we were saying? Steve is there any way that you could have knocked into something? Sounded like it was on the wall, right in my ear. It sounded like knocking. It sounded like somebody, if there was, but there wasn't, like an electrical cord that like hit against the wall, or something. What it sounded like to me was, something knocked on this, and that's why I looked right away, you know, at this door. This is the kind of stuff that it does. Can you hear this? Can you make a sound similar to that? Can you make a noise like this? (KNOCKING) Dude. (KNOCKING) Dude. (KNOCKING) Dude. So we were investigating down here, doing some call and response. All of a sudden heard a huge slamming, banging sound, crashing sound coming from upstairs. It was startling because it was very loud, to the point where I literally would have thought somebody was upstairs, if everybody wasn't standing right in front of me. Went upstairs and right away started hearing voices, walking up the stairs, footsteps, coming from down here while we were upstairs, and this is all within an hour, mind you, which doesn't happen very often. We would be on a case for weeks to get this amount of activity, and this is happening in just a few hours. I asked for it to repeat the sounds I was making, I knocked on the wall. If you can hear this sound, please make it as well, and I did three knocks on the wall, and instantly those knocks were returned, right on the other side of the wall, and nobody was there. I was there watching it. I don't know what to make of it, other than there's something there communicating with us. I mean honestly that's my gut feeling of it. I don't know for sure what, how, when, but all I know is that things seem to be happening all around us. What do you think they do with something like this? Do they get rid of it? Does it just stay with the property? You get the clergy involved. Yep, and even if you don't believe in the religious side of it, sort of just that, you have somebody with that authority, that power, just taking that control, could be enough. But we try systematic removal, we try a lot of verbal escalation, that sort of thing, where you start off saying, I don't like what you're doing, this and that, and then by the end of it, whether it's a month in or a week in, now you're saying get the fuck, this is my house, and you force it out. We have some degree of success with that, not much, but it has been successful. If this was my case, and I came, I would try what I know how to do, and then I would probably get the clergy involved, you know, if I thought it was inhuman. I would definitely call John Zaffis, I would call Adam Blai, I would call any one of these guys, that are very well-versed in the inhuman type of hauntings, but if you didn't want to go that route, just having the clergy come in and offer a blessing, that sort of thing could help. STEVE: I remember one thing that you said that really stuck out to me was, there was kind of a devil face, or a demon-type face, etched in the brick, up in the old attic. Can you, for the audience here, can you explain to me again, and why it was covered up, and by whom? I remember there being one day that like, my and my little brother climbed up there, and on the south wall of the attic, you could see what looked like, as they built the house, someone had like used their finger, and just kind of dabbed the face of, what kind of reminded me of like a devil look. It was pretty distinctive and you could see it, and then when my stepmom and my dad were remodeling the house, my dad went up there, and actually cemented it in. This is why, to me it's so important that you guys go up there tonight, and take this hammer, take this chisel, and go up there. We gotta get that concrete off, and we have to see what's underneath that concrete. It's almost as if they really believe that this house is cursed. What face is up on that brick? Why would somebody, in 1895, building this house, take their finger in the brick and put a Satanic face, a demon's face. When you guys go up there, be extremely careful. We don't know about the structure, you guys could come right through the floor, and you'll get seriously injured. I'm gonna head outside, with the talk of witchcraft, from the aunts and cousin of Rebecca, that were putting spells on the land for prosperous seasons. I highly don't believe that. It makes you wonder what was really going on out there. Stay in contact, if you guys need anything, let me know. I am seeking to make contact, and communication, with whomever, or whatever, resides on this property, on this land. Were you summoned here? Conjured? I am asking you to come forward, come toward this light. I can't do this. I can't have something evil attached to me, and bring it home to my family, the people that I love, for me to bring something home, something evil? Well, come on Jamie we've been here for weeks. We've been investigating this thing for hundreds of hours. If it wants to attach itself to any one of us, it already has. This family, the family that has owned this home for over a century, is being forced out of here, forced off this land that they worked hard to cultivate, to clear, to plow, to harvest, raising children, families, all of this, taken from them. I command you now, to come forward, and quit hiding out here in the shadows, amongst the trees. We hear you night after night, coming to this house, unloading our gear. We hear the footsteps, we see the shadows. What vendetta do you have with this family? With the Schaefer bloodline? People told me not to mess with this, people that I love, people that cared about me. Dude, we just gotta get through this, get through this investigation, this will be over soon. But we gotta get through it. Do you see that? Why did the light die? We're not supposed to be up here. Look here, it's almost completely uncovered, and the light dies? This doesn't want us up here. (BIRDS SINGING) (DOOR CREAKING) (DOOR CLOSING) STEVE: Hello? Who's there? Oh man. This is private property. Who is here? Hello? (CRASHING) Jesus Christ! CAMERAMAN: Jamie? Do you need me to take over for you? Do you need me to finish that? If it's gonna do something, let it do it to me. Just take the camera, and I'll take over. (SOBBING) Just take that. STEVE: Who the hell are you? What are you? We know that you're not a human spirit. We've known this for a long time. What conjured you here, what brought you here? You have no ties with this family, with this property. They put their heart and their soul into this. This is theirs. This is their right. Get the hell out of here. Go back to hell, or wherever you came from. Do you understand me? Oh my God. Go back to hell, or wherever you came from. Do you understand me? Oh my God. JAMIE: Oh my God, what is this? I can't do this. CAMERAMAN: This was a mistake. JAMIE: Here, I can't, here, take this. I have to get out of here. CAMERAMAN: It's gonna be all right, Jamie. What is going on? What happened to you guys up there? JAMIE: I don't know. We were chiseling away at the concrete, and it was, - there was like this huge face. - So you guys uncovered it? Yeah, it was totally there. I couldn't stay up there. You weren't there, you didn't see. It was evil. Adam, you were there, tell him. What happens if I bring something home? Is something gonna come home with me? Listen, there is no guarantee with stuff like this. In my opinion, whatever's in this house, is gonna stay here. Okay? That's my opinion, but I can't guarantee that. All of you guys know, this is part of the risk, when you do stuff like this. I don't think it's gonna attach to you. Jamie, I don't know. Somebody brought it in here, okay? Whether it was Rebecca's brother, or her cousin, or her aunt, all the crazy stuff that happened here, I don't know. I don't have the answers, but if that thing has been up there for a hundred years, I don't think it's going anywhere.
