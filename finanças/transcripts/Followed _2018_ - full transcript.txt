I think I made a mistake. Why do you have to finish it? You answer me please. Just answer me. Why do you have to finish it? You can't come to your... To your... Jess, I love you most, okay? Please, someone. Anyone, if you know anything about her disappearance. What's up, minions? DropTheMike here at the Pasadena suicide bridge. How awesome is this? In 1913, the bridge was built and since then, 100 people have leapt to their deaths, the most famous of which is Myrtle Ward. Myrtle Ward is famous for having tossed her infant off this bridge and jumping shortly thereafter so that they could spend the afterlife together forever. Isn't that sweet? In a remarkable twist of fate, thick branches slowed the infant's fall to the ground and it landed mostly unharmed. Myrtle wasn't so lucky though and people say that you can still hear her ghost wandering beneath the bridge at night, searching for her newborn child. All right, guys. That's it for this installation. I am DropTheMike, subscribe to my channel. I post sick and twisted new videos every other... What's up, minions? It's DropTheMike here. Some of you sick bastards have been asking me for special behind the scenes extras. Well follow me this way, if you dare. This is my little baby. Little J Dahmer. Hey, hey, do your impersonation of a strangulation victim. Mwah. And right over here is my always effervescent fiance, Jess. Say hi to the multitudes, baby. All right as you can see, Jess is an incredibly talented artist right over here. She's also a nurse on the west side of Los Angeles. A truly noble career path if I do say so myself, unlike yours truly. Hey, so my followers have a few questions for you. Wanna answer them? Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Oh, come on, come on, don't do this to me. Loosecanon99 wants to know do you approve of what Mike does? Ugh, no. I haven't seen one of his films in a while. They're just unsettling for my taste, you know? But he loves what he does and it keeps him off drugs, so. So she thinks. Okay, get out of here. I got work to do. Ow! Ladies and gentlemen and everything in between, this is my inner sanctum. This is where my wicked brew is concocted and the witch stirring the visual pot is none other than my editor and occasional cohort, the amazing Nic. Say hi to the minions, Nic. She loves me. After each shoot, the DP and I unload all of our video and sound cards to her and she has carte blanche to edit them as she sees fit. And of course, last but not deceased, is my DP, which is Director of Photography for your idiots out there, and very best friend. The one and only Christopher. Hey, Chris, turn the camera around and show them your ugly mug, okay? Gotcha, didn't I? No, this is not Christopher. This is Fred the Head. He's great, isn't he? Okay, Chris, we can show you now. We can introduce you. Okay give me the camera, good. Separated at birth? I think so. You're such a dick. Stop! Talk about good head, right, friend? Stop, Nic! God, will you guys get out of here? Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm gonna cut... What's up, minions? Okay, really, all joking aside, I just had an incredible phone call with the super popular clothing store, Haute Gothic. They just told me that if I can get 50,000 subscribers by the end of Halloween weekend, they're gonna sponsor me a whopping $250,000. That is 250 grand, people! It's incredible. Okay, so this is where you come in. I need you to comment below and tell me what horrifying locations you think I should do a super scary Halloween edition vlog, okay? It's gonna be sick. If you don't do it, Fred the Head will be so sad. Love you guys and I'll see you later. DropTheMike out. What's up, minions? Bet you're wondering what I'm doing in this seemingly peaceful middle class street. Sweet costume, dude. Uh, excuse me, I'm Michael Myers. I may look like a troll doll, but I'm Michael Myers. Many people don't know this, but real life serial killer David Olmos dumped one of this many victims' dead bodies in this street. It was in this exact spot that the neighbors found her dismembered body in a trash can the next morning. Oh my God, Chris. Chris. She's still here. Oh, it was too soon. She was so innocent, it's so... oh, that feels real good. Oh, this wig is real itchy. Anyways, two weeks ago, I asked you guys to tell me where you thought that I should shoot my Halloween vlog coming up, sponsored by Haute Gothic. Shhh. The response was overwhelming I couldn't believe how much you guys wanted to see me at the winning location, which is the Lenox Hotel. Per your requests, I'm gonna be spending the entirety of Halloween weekend there with my crew. The hotel happens to be where Night Crawler, David Olmos, lived and is also where a tourist, Meghan Kim, famous for her elevator video recently met her untimely demise. We're shooting the entirety of the vlog there. And we have an expert here to tell us more about this petrifying place. That person is. My friend and haunted hotel historian, Wallace Fleischer, author of the book "The Many Curses of Hotel Lenox." Please join me in welcoming the one and only, the singular sensation, Wallace Fleischer. Good evening, sire. Thank you very much. I'm not gonna kiss your hand, you're not wearing a ring. But Wallace, thank you very much for having us into your home today, we appreciate it. You're more than welcome, Mike. Hi, Chris. Hi, Wallace. So why did you write about Hotel Lenox? I began to understand why it was so frightening after I learned more about its sordid history. The Hotel Lenox is downtown LA near where Skid Row area is. They changed the name of the hotel many times over the years because of its very bad reputation, especially what happened a few months ago with the hotel, which I'll go into in a moment. It was built in 1927, there were 123 people who were either murdered or killed themselves in this hotel. Now, the infamous David Olmos. Ah, yes. - The Night Crawler. - The Night Crawler. He stayed on the 14th floor in 1985. Managed to murder 14 people. He lured people into his room, mostly prostitutes, which then he would dismember. But not before he had completely stripped their bodies, tortured them, and had sex with their dead bodies. The neighbors, they'd heard this humming sound at night of the electric hacksaw but they didn't know what it was for so no one ever said anything. Wow! A devil worshiper. How cliche. Yes, that's a satanic symbol of Babylon. Follow Satan, you will. So all joking aside, could you tell us what happened to David Olmos? Well, he cut his throat in jail. Wow, I think this sets the stage beautifully. I wanna thank Wallace Fleischer for enlightening us on the hotel's history. Thank you very much for your time, Wallace. And be sure to keep track of us as we gear up for our three nights at the Hotel Lenox, we'll be posting - our vlogs beforehand... - Wait. You're not staying there? You're not gonna listen to a thing Wallace has to say, are you? About not staying at the hotel? Are you kidding me? Dude, it's ooga booga nonsense. You know, there's no such thing as spirits, and ghosts, and blah blah blah. You do a vlog about spirits, and ghosts, and blah blah blah. Yeah, I also watch horror movies. That doesn't mean that I believe in everything that I see in them. I don't know, man. I don't think we should do this one. Seriously? Are you kidding me? Give me the camera. God. What a pussy. Look at yourself. I mean, we have been to so many different places where terrible things have happened. Are you seriously gonna ditch the vlog over one hotel? This is different. How? The other places we shot outside, we never went in them. What? Inside, outside, what difference does that even make? I'm look, sorry. I'm sorry, okay? No, this is great. This is exactly why I keep you around for this Catholic-y, pope-y nonsense that you were raised on. It's a nice, new perspective. But seriously, okay, you were brainwashed by some pastor, or priest, or whatever who had dressed up in their nice, little robe costume, preaching these ideas to you so that they... It's not made up! I've seen ghosts. I've seen evil spirits. Seriously, chill out, I... I wanna know, okay? Just talk to me, man. I was 10 years old. I looked in the bathroom and there's this kid standing in the doorway. His right hand, he's holding this tabby cat from a noose. He drops this cat and it starts running at me and it's like, scratching and clawing at my face. I was blinded but I, I finally reached the light switch and by the time I turned it on, they were both gone. I called my mom the next day and I told her to come pick me up and get me out of there. Wow, dude, that's terrible. That's the most terrible fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life. I mean, a fucking tabby cat in a noose ran at you and attacked you in the face? Are you kidding me? I mean, come on. Think about this, okay? It is always when people are falling asleep, halfway between awake and sleeping, they are ramping into REM cycle and their mind plays tricks on them... What about the scratches on my face? Dude, your own fingernails. Come on, Einstein. You know, it's nice to know that the only two people I've ever told this to, you and my mother, don't believe me. Dude, seriously. That cat and that kid were real. Yeah, okay. Sure, whatever. I'm not doing Hotel Lenox, man, there's no way. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not! Yes, you are, all right? Tune in next week to find out if pussy Christopher here grew a pair of testicles. Shut up, Michael! Okay, guys. So pussy Christopher threw a wrench in the works last night. Now, I could hire a new DP for Halloween weekend but he and I know each others' work rhythms and we've been working together since high school. So... so, I'm gonna try a different tactic. Danni, that you? Mike? The one and only. What the hell are you doing here? Do you got a second? Oh gentle, gentle, Jesus. Oh God, that thing does not work well, does it? Yeah. Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. Wow, looking good. So what are you doing down there? You know the sound makes when you drive a car, that Uh, sure. I was recording it for a friend's short. - Okay, I see, yeah. - Don't ask. Hey, look, I need you Halloween weekend. Can you turn that off? No, I'm a vlogger. Look, I just need you to do third camera, some backup sound. Okay, what's the hitch? What are you talking about? There's always a hitch with you, Mike. Okay, it's in a hotel that the unenlightened claims is mildly haunted. And? And I need you to get Christopher to do the shoot with us. Oh. Yeah, no, that's... Look, look. Christopher likes you. Okay, he more than likes you. Thank you for that. So you wanna capitalize on our friendship and his feelings. That's just great. Just three days and three nights. Okay, I'll give you scale plus 200. That means 200 a day. Okay, send me the details. Yes! And a contract. Of course, always. Only the best for you. That's why you're my favorite. So I just got off the phone with the Hotel Lenox's manager. She said we absolutely cannot shoot there under any conditions. The hotel's gotten a lot of bad press since the Meghan Kim elevator video and Meghan Kim's family is now suing them. So I don't know, I guess I just gotta give up. Just kidding, fuck it. As you can see, we've decided to shoot at the hotel anyways. So we're packing all of our gear into suitcases to disguise ourselves as tourists. We're also gonna be wearing hats and other things so that people can't recognize us. And what's special about this vlog is, we're gonna have Nic on set editing live. How you feeling about that, Nic? Oh you know, absolute thrilled. Yes, you are. She's going to be posting videos throughout Halloween night so you've gotta make sure that you see them before the hotel yanks 'em, all right? And we are so excited to have Danni on board. Yay! Hey, Danni, do you really think that there are evil spirits waiting in the hotel, ready to pounce? Pretty sure the only thing waiting to pounce is bed bugs, Mike. That's disgusting. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and we're welcoming back into the fold the one and only Christ-opher. The only reason I'm doing this is because I'm $500 shy on rent. Yeah, uh-huh, sure. So Chris, why don't you tell our sycophants about some of the amazing gear that you've brought with us? We've got a couple of security cams here, spy cam, set up with a button, and hat cam. Oh, that's sick. Where's the lens? The lens is the left eye of the smiley face. Oh, that's sick. If that's not cool enough, we got a drone packed up and ready to go. Oh, no way. That's so millennial of us. Hey, Chris, can I borrow that for my next sex tape? I heard that. Everybody, will you please just be careful? I don't want any of you ending up in the ER, all right? Kiss her! Shush! All right, come on. Oh hey, hey, one more for camera. One more for camera. Come on, come on. There it is. Get. That was a little taste for those of you out there who can't get any action, which is most of you. Anyways, we're headed to downtown Los Angeles. Ooh. This is your co-pilot, Michael. We are now entering the first layer of Dante's Inferno, please make sure that your seats are in their full upright and missionary position. Hey, grab my phone charger out of there, will you? What the... Yes! Motherfu... I spring loaded it. Yeah, tricked the trickster. Well played, Slim Shady. But just so you know, payback's a bitch. The nice part of downtown's just two blocks away. It's feast or famine down here. Check this guy out. Nic, give him $50 and maybe he'll do a backflip. Jesus! Ow. Does anybody know why they put those gargoyles on the side of buildings like that? It's to ward off evil. Actually, they are there to prevent the rainwater from falling down the masonary walls. Wow, Nic. Throwing out knowledge sans Google. I'm telling you, it's to ward off evil. I think I'm gonna go with Nic on this one, buddy. Sorry. There she is. Can you feel the love, Christopher? No, it looks creepy already. I don't see any gargoyles up there. Hmm, not cool. Hey, do you guys see that boy there? Oh! What the... Okay. Hey, dude. I don't need my windshield cleaned. It's fine. You have change? I don't have any change on me. We don't have any money in here, I'm sorry, dude. A dollar's fine. Dude, you need to just leave. I don't have anything, I'm sorry. You don't have to be an asshole about it. Whoa. You're the asshole, dude. I hope you die! Did that homeless dude just tell me to die? Alrighty, my minions. From here on out, we are rolling 24/7. We take a dump, it better be on camera. Great. My ass can end up as a meme. Whoa! What's up, dude? Weird deja vu moment. Glitch in the matrix? Yeah. All right, the same elevator Meghan Kim was last seen in before she disappeared. Creepsville. Ooh, ooh, ooh. These are the buttons she pushed, too. Hey, why are we going up to 14? You'll see. Here we are. It's not as horrible as I thought. Only the finest for my fine, fine crew. Oh, please. The receptionist said some of the floors are nicer than others. The rest of them... Rat-infested hell holes. Yeah, pretty much. For like low income locals and backpackers and such, anyways. All right, so Nic. You are in room 1426. Guys, give her peace. She needs to edit. Break legs, guys. Literally. And us. Guys, we're in room 1428. Why is he so excited about this? This does not bode well for us. Well I told you guys I had a surprise, right? This is your present. This is the room where, where David Olmos lived when he murdered those 14 people. You're kidding? Really? Dude, there's no way I'm staying in there. Yes, you are. No, I'm not staying in David's death dungeon. Dude, that was like, 30 years ago. Stop being such a pussy. I resent that pussy comment. Why is it guys always say that when someone's not being brave enough? It's not a question of being brave. Yes, it is. As in, they're female-like, meaning they're less than they should be. It's not a question of bravery here, it's a question of being stupid or not. Okay, look it. It's a room, all right? There is no scientific data that evil spirits lurk in physical spaces, all right? It's what you bring into it psychologically that matters so let's go. Thank you. Okay, I want to retract my previous demeaning statement about the female gender. Chris, you need to amp up the pussy power. Right. Yeah! Dude, come on. Hello? Nic, can I stay with you? I'll set my cot up in the corner. Come on. Come on. Come on, it's amazing. All right, I claim this bed. You can sleep with your boyfriend, Mike. Mm, perfect. We're gonna snuggle so much. Hey Chris, can I get like, an interview shot of you with the bathroom really quickly. 'Cause you're a piece of shit. Ha ha. Okay, Chris, how does it feel to stand in the bathroom where David Olmos dismembered all those bodies? Awesome. I can take a poop in peace later. Thanks, that's all I wanted. Hey, actually, will you grab me a water from the mini bar? Amazing. Jerk! You got me with Fred the Head. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. He's gonna be our own little gargoyle. He'll ward off the evil spirits, you know? Oh yeah, if anything, he'll tow them right to our room like the Death Star's tractor beam. You're such a fucking nerd. Okay, guys, we gotta get geared up. We're losing light so we wanna get some more exteriors before that happens. All right? Over and out the door, guys. What's up, minions. DropTheMike here behind the creepy deepy Hotel Lenox. We are in one of its many back alleys. Watch out for the street juice, Chris, it's pretty disgusting. Right here is the dumpster where David Olmos would dump his dismembered bodies. Sweet, baby! Oh! Excuse me, miss. Would you mind if I interview you for my documentary? Mind if I ask your name? Hey, guys. Check out our neighborhood drug dealer. Oh, shit. Guys? Guys. Oh, okay. What are you fucking recording? Get back here! Hey who was that, Danni? One of your exes? So funny, I thought it was your pimp. Not funny, guys. Welcome back, kids. Once again, we're in the Hotel Lenox. And right now, I'm walking down the hallway where serial killer David Olmos would sneak to this very fire escape. Am I following you on this? Yeah, of course you're following me. Why are we friends with this guy? Are you coming? Yeah. Come on. It's here that David Olmos would perform his satanic rituals before heading out into the city to find his next victim. How unbelievably awesome is that. Whoa. Mike, check out this poor guy. Oh, somebody is not having a good day. Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore. Bad omen, dude. Hey, did you pack the drone? It's in the pack. All right, let's unload the cards from tonight. Nic'll take care of it then we can rig our room with night cams and then get a good night's sleep and start fresh in the morning. A good night's sleep in this place. Are you high? Nut attack. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. So this, my friends, is a 45nm blacklight that I got for like $100 online. It's gonna pick up any bad energy that might be in the room. Meghan Kim's coming for ya. All right. I think though there's any blood in here either. What we need is one of those ghostbuster lights. Oh man, look at that creepy little vent above the sink. I bet this is where they could smell Meghan Kim's body burning. Maybe I should shove some shish kabobs in there. Oh wait, hold on a second. What? Did you hear that? Christopher, I'm coming to get you. I'm crawling up the vent. Shut up, Mike! Dude, there's nothing in there. Come on. How's it going, Nicolai? Buzz off. I'm working. That's my girl. You know this is gonna be like trying to sleep in a graveyard. Would cuddling make you feel bett... Hey! - Don't touch. - Fuck, dude. I thought you were gonna punch me. Save room or Jesus. Danni. I think little Chrissy Wissy needs a lullaby. Know any? Pwease, Danni? Yeah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! ♪ Rock a bye baby in the tree tops ♪ ♪ And down will come baby cradle and all ♪ Down will come baby, cradle and all? That's supposed to comfort me? Dude, children's stories are fucked up. Wait, that is really terrifying. I never thought about that. Hey, whatcha got there? Anxiety. Are you still on those? Yep. I've actually got my little ambies right here. This shit fucks you up. Man, you guys are a mess. Fuck you. Uh, guys. I know I joke around a lot and shit but I just wanted to say barricade! This is why I wanted my own bed! Come to me, my children! I'm gonna fart, I'm gonna fart. - Don't fart! - I will squash you with the pillow. I shall squash you. Oh, I farted so bad right on Chris. Did you set an alarm? Yeah. Okay. Night, guys. Goodnight. Mike, get your hand off of my butt! Did you guys hear that? That's not funny. No, seriously. Oh fuck, Fred fell. Oh no. Hang on, I got it. That's creepy. How did you fall, dude? We're heading down to the basement where Meghan Kim's dead body was found in the back boiler room. And if that's not sick enough, we're gonna try out the drone down there. Whoa. Weird deja vu moment again. You guys didn't get that? No. Oh get this, get this. No trespassing. Crap, oh seriously? Oh, dude we need bolt cutters. Dude, you can't get through that. I can figure it out. Here, take this and set up the camera over there, okay? You don't have super powers by any chance, do you? I got pussy power. You're not as funny as you think you are. Whoa. Oh, hey there we go. I think that I can fit it through. You boys struggling to make something fit? Ha. I love you, Danni. Okay. You got the picture up. Yeah. It's gonna be so cool. Okay, here we go. Ooh, that is creepy. Look at that. I think I found a new dream home for me and Jess. This hallway on the left? Wait, go the other way first. Do you see those? Oh, that's random. Huh, it's a cheap date for Christopher. Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Check that out. Is that a person? Nah, it's just another creepy mannequin. Okay, go back to the hallway. You're really good at this. Your fingers are quite magic. I know. Those stairs? Mm-hmm. Can you go down them? Descend. Descend into the dark... Whoa. Where is it? What happened to the feed? What happened? Dude, what did you do? Mike, will you stop? We have to find this thing, I have to return it. Can I help you? Oh, busted. I know what you guys are doing down here. Listen, I'm a huge fan of your vlog. You're DropTheMike and shit, right? Yeah, dude. Nice to meet you. Wow, thank you for watching. Yeah, of course. I love it but, you know, I still can't let you in there with all, you know, all the electrical boxes and shit. What's your name, man? - Tony. - Tony, nice to meet you. Mike. Do you wanna... why don't you come down here and say hi to my followers? What's up, guys? Tony, you like movies? Yeah, who doesn't? Could you ever see yourself working security on a big studio lot? Holy shit, that'd be awesome. Yeah? Management, she has a meeting like, tomorrow night. I might be able to snag you a key then. You can just, I don't know, like stick the key in an envelope and put it through my door. Yeah, absolutely. Amazing. Hey, do you have any like insider knowledge about the Meghan Kim thing? You guys know about The Elevator Ritual, right? No, I do not know about The Elevator Ritual. Look up The Elevator Ritual online, then rewatch the Meghan Kim elevator footage. It'll get you closer to the truth. Okay, so apparently, there is a popular Korean game called The Elevator Ritual. What is that? So first, you have to have a hotel that is at least 10 floors, which lucky for us, Lenox has more than 10 floors. Mmm, of course. Then you enter the elevator on the first floor alone. You then go to the following floors in this precise order. You go to the fourth, second, sixth, second, 10th, and then fifth. This is fascinating. Okay, it gets more interesting, okay? When you reach the fifth floor, a woman is supposed to enter. Ooh, a woman. And then you have mad, crazy sex. No, you're not supposed to look at her or speak to her. Then you press the first floor button. If the elevator descends to the lobby, you exit quickly without looking back. But, if instead of going to the lobby, the elevator goes to the 10th floor, you exit and the woman's going to ask, "Where are you going?" You are not supposed to answer her or even look at her. What happens next? Apparently, you enter the other world. And what is that supposed to be? I don't know but check out Meghan Kim's video. See that? Wait, what is she pressing? Okay, so the buttons she pressed were one, five, 10, two, six, two, four. That's not the order you said, though. No. It is the order, just reversed. My guess is that Meghan Kim played The Elevator Ritual the night before and the night that she disappeared, she was trying to undo it by pressing the buttons backwards. I'm gonna do it so you don't need to get your panties in a bunch, you don't have to go with me 'cause it does say that you have to do it alone, so. I hope I come back, guys. This is wrong, Mike. Dude, relax. Yeah, I'm with her. All right, let's get ready. Let's do it. Okay, mighty minions, it's just after midnight. I'm all rigged up for The Elevator Ritual. I got my fancy little button cam, a handheld so we got multiple angles for you guys, and in the words of cinematic thespian, Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger, I'll be back. Don't wait up, kids. Be careful. Okay, minions. We're about to embark on The Elevator Ritual, starting on the first floor. Tony the security guard totally hooked me up and shut off the security camera in the elevator for 10 whole minutes. Tell Jess I love her. Okay, so as the rules mandate, we're going to the fourth floor first. Fourth floor. Going down. That wasn't so bad. Now we head down to two. I feel like the world's slowest yo-yo. Second floor. Going up. Number six is next. Sixth floor. Going down. Man, this game is crazy. Second floor. Huh, this seems familiar. Going up. Whoa. 10th floor. Okay, so some faulty wiring. But so far, all is good. All right, final floor. Going down. My heart's pounding for some reason. Fifth floor. All right. Debunked. Let's head back down to one. What? Let's head on home. Oh. You lost, son? No, no, I'm fine. Thank you so much. Okay. Okay, guys. Looks like the Korean elevator game is indeed a big hoax. I knew it from the get-go. Where are you going? Right there, right there. What? Is that the fifth floor? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, right there. What? What, that's Meghan Kim, dude. You didn't say anything to her, did you? No, no, no, of course I didn't say anything to her. - What? - I was terrified. My heart has never beat that fast before. It was crazy, I've never been that scared. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You hired a look-alike. No, no, I swear. I swear I did not hire a look-alike, okay? Dude, are you - messing around? - Was this you guys? No, it wasn't us! It wasn't you guys? 'Cause if it was, please fess up 'cause I will worship the ground that you walk on. Seriously, okay? Dude, this isn't a joke! Are you kidding me? Look at the video, that's her. You know what this means? It means we're gone. That's her. No, no, no. Dude, this was one of my fucking fans! - No, Mike. - No. One of my followers dressed up as Meghan Kim and came to the hotel just to scare me. - Oh, that's amazing. - No, you're wrong! I love you guys. Ugh! Dude, look at the picture. That is her. You're messing with your life, Michael. She doesn't look like Meghan Kim, okay? Look, we will go compare it to the footage from the actual elevator video. She looks nothing like Meghan Kim, okay? You're wrong. You're wrong. God, I'm sweating so much. Okay, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Dude, that's the same girl. That is not the same person at all. I could go either way, guys. Come on, Danni. Who's that? Did you hear that? What's going on? Who's out there? There's nobody out here. Come here. Mike, they just knocked. They couldn't have hid that quick. I don't see anybody, dude, okay? It's not like a... Is anybody out here? No, there's nobody here. Weird. I don't know. Who was it? They ran away again. I don't know. Nothing? What is this? Another earthquake, Mike? Dude. They couldn't have hid that fast. It's probably just Nic messing with us. I can't believe I'm locking in myself in David Olmos's room. They're really good at this, it's amazing. Guys, guys, guys, chill. It's just, it's my text messages, okay? It's Jess, she wants to Skype with me. Just, you guys have a few minutes. Just relax, I'm sorry it scared you. Just chill, okay? Hey, babe. How's everything going, hun? It's good. Going awesome, how are you? Yeah, it's really busy right now. They asked me to work a double, lots of injuries, bunch of drunks and such, just typical Halloween Eve stuff. I can imagine. Just careful around those drunk idiots, okay? I'll let you get back to work. Wait. What's up? I wanted to wait until you got home for me to tell you this but the administration asked the entire staff to take a blood test last week, just usual drug testing stuff, but they said that they found something unusual in my blood. Unusual? Yeah, it's called chorionic gonadotropin. Jesus, what is that? More accurately, it's referred to as human chorionic gonadotropin. Well what is it? Is it a disease? I mean... I'm pregnant, Michael. You're pregnant? Did Chris put you up to this? No. I'm completely serious. I mean, they already confirmed it. Babe, we're gonna have a baby. We're gonna have a baby. Oh, man. How does that make you feel? Uh, my mind is completely blown, but... This is fantastic news. I mean, I mean, God, it's unexpected as shit, but... Are we getting this right now? Yeah. Listen, I gotta go back to work, but we'll celebrate when you get home? Yeah, no, we'll celebrate when we get home, absolutely. Love you. I love you more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Say what? Oh my God! That's massive! Oh my God. Okay. You heard it here first. Wat are you guys talking about? - Don't worry about it. - Nothing. Oh, that's so... Danni, are you getting that? The noise? - Yeah. - Thanks. What is that? I don't know, dude. Just chill out, please. The hotel's like 90 years old, come on. Trust me, my 90 year-old grandmother made a lot worse noises than that. What is going on? Danni, did you pick that up? Yeah. It sounds like it's Nic's room. Dude, can you go check on her? Dude, just... Please just go over there. Yeah, camera? Always. Hey, Nic? Hey, do you have that overnight footage ready yet? I wanna see how it turned out. Nic? Christopher! I have six new video cards to download and cut. I don't have time for you to be playing your stupid junior high school games. Now will you please just shut up and close the door? Jesus, Nic. Your nose. Shit, I'm fine. I am fine. Now just give me some freaking space! Okay, jeez, jeez. Ugh, now what? Hello? You okay, dude? Too much wine? Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike! Mike, Mike! Jesus, dude, what is it? This guy at the end of the hallway, his head! What about his head? It bent backwards all unnatural. What? Yeah, yeah. Just completely un-human. Wait, where? There's nobody here, dude. Where did he go? He was right there. You think he went out the fire escape? It's open. Are you sure you saw someone? Yes, I'm sure I saw someone. There's nobody up here, okay? Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that? Oh, what? What is that? It's right on top of... Oh! A satanic symbol. Oh, it's just like the one that David Olmos has on his hand. Wait, isn't this right where our room is, guys? Oh, man. But there's not even room service in this hotel, is there? No, not for decades. Mike, don't touch it. Don't touch it. It's warm. Mike. Oh! Oh, that is so gross. Oh, that's disgusting. Oh my God, it smells. I can't. There's something... What is that? I think it's a tongue? It's a tongue. Don't. Please don't touch it. I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it. I can't. Guys, chill, it's not human. How do you know that? Because it's way too big, okay? They would have had to gut Gene Simmons. Mike, I actually don't feel comfortable with this. We should talk to hotel management. Call the cops, man. No, they'll kick us out and we'll lose the shoot. Look, this isn't about ghastly spirits, they don't exist, okay? I'm sorry that like, you're concerned right now but... Look, don't tell me that I'm overreacting, okay? - Dude, Christopher. - Chris, Chris. And don't tell me that I'm losing some type of control. Stop, stop. Watch your step, watch your step, watch your step. All right, you've got to admit it's pretty awesome that the vlog is getting interactive. Interactive? Yeah. No, this is demonic. Dude, if dastardly demons were real, then nobody would be staying in this hotel. That's what you don't get, Mike. It's not about them being real, it's about you provoking them. Okay, you need to relax. Here. Mama's little helper. It's way better than that anxiety bullcrap you've been taking. You'll get better dreams, too. I would advise against that. Hey, not helpful. There you go. Thatta boy. Seriously, dude, it's gonna help. All right, guys. I mean, that's hardcore but let's... Let's head downstairs and we'll set a trap for whoever's been knocking on the door in the morning, okay? It's probably the same DropTheMike follower as whoever did this, so, all right? Yes, can we go? Agreed. Hey, Christopher said your nose was bleeding. Are you okay? Are you okay? Nic. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Talk to me, what's wrong? What's wrong? Fuck. Oh God, you're recording this, aren't you? No, no, no, no. It's just a force of habit. You'll edit it out later, okay? Okay, please edit it out. My God. Hey, hey, come on. No, no, no, I just... Just seems like a lot of energies are boiling up inside of me this weekend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey listen, just do me a favor. I want you to get some sleep tonight and stop editing for a little bit. You can worry about it in the morning. No, there's gonna be too much to finish. No, no, no, there isn't, okay? Look, look, everybody knows we're on a time crunch. You don't need to make things as flawless as you normally do. I'm sorry, I'm so embarrassed. No, no, no, no. Don't be sorry, don't be sorry. All right, you're gonna get some sleep, right? Okay. All right. I need way more subscribers, guys. Come on. You've gotta help me out here. Okay. Danni, you awake? Are you sleeping? Far from it. You watch Chris's footage of the headless guy? Yeah. That was freaky as hell. You want? Everybody's doing it, right? Right on. Hey, guys, so we're waiting for my super fan or whoever it is that's been trolling us and knocking on the door so we're just doing a little stakeout right now. It's been super interesting so far so I thought I'd clue you guys in. Anyways. Is that a good idea? They're just walking away, it's fine. Hey, Chris. Want floor on your food. No! What is that? Stop, man. You guys are like, awkwardly close. You know that, right? Eh. Wait. I don't think I actually know how you guys met. Let's see, elementary school. No. No, it was... We met at the psychiatrist's office. Yep, we were in the... No, you're messing with me. No, yeah. We were in the waiting room. I knew you guys were totally screwed up. All right, boys. What were you in for? I don't know. Parent shit. I'll be right back. Where you going? I'm gonna give my pee ration at the urination station. You know, for a guy who really likes the sound of his own voice, that was pretty weird. Well, get down to the good stuff and he bolts. This would be like, a really good time to tell me why you stopped calling me over the summer. Are you not gonna tell me? No. No? Tell me. Okay, okay. The pain started to outweigh the pleasure. Mike, is that you? What is that supposed to mean? Mike, I can't see you, buddy. You gotta... I can't see you, it's too dark. I loved you. Mike, man, I am so sorry about everything that happened. Yo, have you been in contact with Chris or Danni? And I knew that you didn't feel the same way. I don't know, I sound like a Hallmark card right now. Like a little. Chris, you know that you've always been like, a brother to me, right? Mm-hmm. I mean, when you stopped calling me, it was kind of a void for me too. I don't know, it's a two-way street, I guess. Woo! I just expelled a foul demon out my ass. TMI, dude. So what were you guys talking about? Nothing, Mike. Okay, whatever dude. Hey, so I was thinking we can finish up lunch soon. I don't think anybody's gonna show up right now so we might as well. What the... I think I know that kid from somewhere. You know him? Hey, kid! I'll be right back. Kid, wait up. Mike, where are you going? What do you mean you know him? Mike? Mike! I'm gonna go find him. Mike? Mike! Where'd he go? Do you see him? He's gone. Hey kid, wait. He's not here. Dude, I don't know. We should check on Nic. No, no, no, no. Leave her alone, she was upset earlier. Is that... Does that... What? Chris? Danni? Chris? Chris, turn on your camera light. Chris! Danni, run! Danni, open the door! Do you have the key? No, I don't have a key. Fuck, fuck. Danni, open the door. Okay, okay. - Wait, wait. - Do you hear that? Wait. Hey, kid. Hey. Where do I know you from? Hey. Fold up the tripod. Fold up the tripod. Get behind me. Get behind me. Whoa, oh my God. - Oh my God. - Mike? What the hell are you guys doing here? What are you doing here? We thought you were gone chasing that kid. How did you... Did you see Olmas? What are you talking about? There was a guy out there who looked like him. I was just knocking on room 440, okay? Stop messing with us, Mike! We saw him out there! Jesus, Chris! I am not messing with you, okay? I was knocking on room 440 and you guys answered the door. I don't know what's happening, okay? Check my footage if you don't believe me. What happened? What is this? I don't know, dude, leftover drone footage. No, it's not! I remember shooting that drone footage... Chris, stop yelling at me! Okay, boys, sit down! Did you not just see that guy outside with the hacksaw? What guy with the hacksaw, okay? We got it on video, listen... I don't care, Danni. The hallway was empty. I was just knocking on a door on the fourth floor and I don't know what happened. What were you doing at room 440? I was chasing that kid, okay? God. Mike, what's in your hand? Oh my God, what? Oh my God. Oh my God. What is... Oh my God. Oh, that's disgusting. Can we please call the police? Dude. Dude, chill, okay? It's probably just... Give me a second. It's probably just from the... from the same animal that the tongue and the entrails came from, okay? Mike, what kind of kid carries an eyeball around? Go down and confront them. I'm not going to confront a bunch of maniacs. If we have both cameras pointed on them, they're not gonna do anything. Uh, yes, they could take our cameras, kill us, and then God knows what. Fine. I'll call Tony, okay? And he can help us. God, this is disgusting. This is where he led you? Yeah. Oh my. What do you want? Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. Is there a young boy staying with you? No. Are you making a movie? I love movies. No, we're making a documentary. Has anything strange happened in your room since you two started staying here? No. Should there have? Sorry for the inconvenience. No problem. Have a blessed day. Joyce! Shut the darn door! I don't know, man. I swear the boy led me here. I don't... Hey, Tony, clean up the mess. Coming. Wait, wait, wait, hang on. Do you have the basement key? I'll get it to you tonight. Thank you. I don't know, guys. I don't know. Michael, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, Wallace, we're fine. Listen, has anything bad ever happened in room 440 in the Lenox? Absolutely. Kay, what was it? In the early nineties, a detective was called in to investigate a crime there. He had a spotless 10 year record and in the investigation, he was trying to find out the reasoning behind a French couple that was bludgeoned to death in that room. He decided to stay in the room, hoping to lure back the killer, but he left after three weeks and returned to his home in Culver City, where he proceeded to put a knife through his wife's heart three times while she was asleep and then gouged her eyes out. After that, he drove the kids... He had kids? Yeah. He had two boys. How old were they? Do you have a picture of them? I do but it's in my book. I'll go get it. I'm gonna use the bathroom while he's looking for that. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on him. Well. Holy shit. Do you know what happened to them? What happened to the boys? Well, he took them to the room, 440 and proceeded to put a knife through his seven year-old's heart and gouge his eyes out, just like his mother. What happened to the younger one? He took off down the stairs, down to the boiler room. The father, the detective chased him. When he go to the boiler room, a maintenance man had been working down there. And before the detective could get his son, the maintenance man bashed his head in and killed him with a pipe wrench. Didn't you know this story? It's a Hotel Lenox classic. Thank you, Wallace. Mike, is everything all right? I gotta go. I need a minute. Mike, you okay? Yeah, yeah. Stuff like that shouldn't happen to kids. Just give me a sec. Chris? Chris? Whatever you do, keep the lens up, okay? Chris, open up! Chris! Chris, Chris? - Christopher! - Chris. Danni, the door's locked. Chris, open the door. Open the door, Chris. Christopher, can you open it? Open it, open it, open it. Chris? Are you okay? Breathe, hey, hey, hey, breathe. Breathe, buddy. Chris, Chris, look at me. Look me in the eye. Chris, look me in the eye. You are okay. Chris, what happened to your face? It was the cat. What do you... Chris? There's no cat in there. - Chris! - No, come back. Chris! Chris, come back. Dude, where are you going? Please? I'm done. I'll give you another $300... This has nothing to do with your money! Get your hand off me! Chris, it's just one more day. Danni, I am done, no! Chris! Danni, you've got to help me keep him here, okay? I'm trying. Mike, can you put the camera down please! Shit. Chris? Chris, please come back. Come on, come on. Christopher, where are you going? I'm done, Danni. I'm done. I can't no more. Chris, please. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You can't bail on me, Chris. You can't on Mike either. Do you know what just happened up there? I can not do this anymore. Are you sure just didn't like scratch yourself by accident? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Stop! Christopher! I was dragged in there by something! There is a reasonable explanation for it. Literally everything. - Reasonable? - Yes! You're kidding me, Danni. No! Maybe Mike, maybe he gave you something, maybe it was those sleeping pills and all that stuff he keeps giving you. - Maybe it's a hallucinogen... - This place is wrong, this place is evil. And if he's fucking around with us, then he's evil, too. I'm done with him! Come with me. I can't. Come with me, I'm leaving in one minute. I cannot stay here anymore. I can't walk out on my responsibilities. I can't just leave Mike and Nic just hanging like that. Danni. Something happened. Please come with me. I can't, Chris. Christopher. Mike, are you serious right now? Mike, I really don't feel comfortable with this. Danni, come on, please? No, Chris is out there freaking out. Like we should really... we should pack our stuff, we should go. Danni, Danni please just stop for a second. We can't leave. What was that? What just happened? I don't know, he had a nervous breakdown. I am just as freaked out by it as you are! Then why can't we just go, okay? Did you see what happened to Chris? We have to go, Mike. Yes, I saw what happened to him! But we can't leave, Danni! I'm sorry. Jess is making the bulk of our income. I make very little money off my ad revenues for the vlog. And now we have a baby on the way. Do you know how terrifying that is? I need this sponsorship, you don't understand. I need it because if I can't provide for her, she's going to leave me. Maybe not in a week, maybe not in a month, but eventually, she's going to realize that I am useless. And then she's going to leave and I cannot lose her. I can't... Mike, I really wanna be here for you as a friend right now, okay? But I am not comfortable. I know, I'm sorry. Why? Why this? Why do we have to be here? I don't wanna talk about it. Mike. Mike, look at me. It's confusing, okay? I just... Things that other people find disgusting and terrifying, there's a disconnect. It doesn't affect me that way. It feels good for me to see those things, okay? And I know that sounds twisted but that's just always how it's been and even when my parents adopted me, they were terrified about it. You were adopted? Mike, I didn't even know that. Apparently, when I was living with my birth mom, I saw something really disturbing and I don't know what it was. I feel terrible about it but look, we are so close to finishing. Okay, we just... My followers just are expecting us to go to the basement. That's the only thing that we need to shoot, that's it. Okay? Please? Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm sorry. Let's try to get ahold of Chris. Yeah. It's crazy to think how many people just look across the street, walk by everyday without knowing all the shit that went down here. Yeah, it's freaky. Hey, I'm really sorry you got so scared. What happened was not cool. It's okay, it's... I mean, there's a reason for everything, right? We just gotta figure out what it was. Oh, Jesus. Looks like somebody's a big fan of you. Dude, get out of here! Dude, bye. Wow, linger much. Christopher still not texting you back? No. Danni, camera. Come on, come on, come on. Mike. Is that the old lady from the room we went to? Oh my God. Her friend must have jumped or something. Oh my God. Why would she do this? This is different, I... Different how? It's not removed. It's not like it is in a picture. I don't know, it's just different, okay? Mike, Mike, we should go. Why? Just, come on. Just walk. Guys, get your camera out of here. Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back. Please. Who's following us? I don't know, I don't know. I don't see anybody. Shit, shit. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on, Danni. Who was that? What are you doing? Throwing him off. Mike, hurry. There's the other elevator. Shit! Why are we running? Because he's clearly after us, Mike. I think he just wants to scare us. Oh fine, if you wanna hang back and chit chat, just be my guest. Where are we? These are the low income floors. Which way do we go? I don't know. That way, that way. They made me do this. Wait, are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Keep going. Mike, come on! How do we get out of here? I don't know. Danni, Danni, Danni, the door. Did you see that? See what? Mike, come on. Okay. Going down. Oh shit. Where's the stairs? It's gotta be somewhere around here. Go, go, go, go, go. Move, move! Mike, where's the key? I dropped the key, I dropped the key. Please go get it. Thank you. No, no, no, no. Please, please. Where's the key? Please. Christopher! Holy shit, was that the guy from the alley? The drug dealer? Oh, Chris. I wanna go home please. Chris, thank you so much. Hey, no one came back for you. He ran down the fire escape. You guys okay? No, far from it. I'll walk you out. You coming? Mike, come with us. Please come... I can't, I can't. Nic's here and the equipment. I can't leave. Guys, guys. Fuck. God damnit. Nic? Nic, Nic, oh my God. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Nic, come on. Nic, Nic, Nic, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Oh my God, Nic. What's wrong? What's wrong? Look at me please? Bad thoughts. Okay, okay. Come here. Come here. No, no, no, no. Ms. Eply? It's about Nic. Jesus, what happened? Hi, Mrs. Eply, thank you so much for coming. I'm sorry, okay? I don't know what happened to her. Honey, honey, what's wrong? Please talk to us. Will you drive please? I wanna sit in the back with her. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna be calling you! Thanks for bringing her down. Hi. Jess. Are you okay? Jess, why are you crying? 'Cause I had a dream. It was a bad dream. I feel like you're in danger and I need you to come home, okay? Jess, I'm sorry. I can't come home yet. Okay? I just... There are things that I have to do here. What do you have to do? I need you here with me. And I... I'm scared. Jess, come on, okay? Please. You know we need the money and I can't. I can work overtime until I can't anymore. I just need you to come home. Stop! Jess, you should never ever have to work overtime again and I can finish here, I just... Mike, are you kidding? This is dangerous and I know that you know it too so can you just come home? I don't know. I think I made a mistake and I have to finish. Okay, and then I'll be home for you, okay? I swear. But I can't leave yet. Why? Jess. Come on. Why do you have to finish it? You answer me please. I can't... Just answer me, why do you have to finish it? You can't come home to your... To your baby, are you kidding? Jess, I love you most, okay? No, Mike. Okay, everybody. Live feed time. Making the final descent. I hope you can see the feed okay. It's spotty. Keep going, Mike, keep going. Just 330 more subscribers. Just 330 more subscribers. Wallace? Michael. Oh God, Michael. Where are you now? I'm heading towards the hotel basement, why? I beg you, please get out of there. I found out what happened to the little boy who escaped his father, the detective. He's the one behind all this, isn't he? Behind scaring us the last few nights. No! No, Michael. What? The boy was you. Wallace, what did you say? The little was you. Only 330 more subscribers. All right, this looks familiar. Get in there. Got it. Part of me was hoping that wouldn't work. This does not smell good. Oh, there are the mannequins that we saw on the drone. Okay. Guess we're going this way. What was that? Oh, there's nothing in there, okay. Okay, okay. All right. What the hell? Keep going, Mike. Keep going, keep going, keep going. What is that? Oh man, the smell is way worse down here. The boiler. Okay. Here, kitty kitty. Here, kitty kitty. What? No way. No way. Is that our drone? What the hell? Oh, it's right... It's right above the vent where Meghan Kim was. Who's there? Who's there? Hello? Oh my God, oh God. Oh God. Who is that? Hello? Who turned that light on? What was that? Who turned that light on? If this is some sick prank, you're doing a great job. What the fuck? Hey! I know somebody's here! Who did this? Shit. Shit, shit. No way. No way, no way, no way. Who's watching me? Is that? Is that Tony's notebook? Why is this page marked? Oh, what the fuck? No way. No, no, no, no. No way. No, this can't be right. Oh, God! Who's there? What the fuck? Who is that? Hey! Who's there? God damnit. Oh, God. Okay, okay, okay. I'm not afraid of you! Come out here! Shit, shit. Okay. Oh God, oh God. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Please leave me alone. Get out of the way! No one's allowed in here. Hey! Hey, guys. Mike here. I'm sorry about the late post. I know some of you have been worried about me. I'm streaming this live so I can answer your questions but before I get to that, I wanted to show you this. It seems I broke my hand. In three places. The police were questioning me for hours about the body in the boiler room. I reached 50,000 subscribers, which I really, really appreciate you guys for. I've been trying to reach Chris, and Nic, and Danni but they don't respond. I don't blame them. I just, I hope they're okay. And I haven't talked to Jess either, but I just, I... I just don't know what to say to her and... I had a lot of time to think. A lot of time. And I think the best decision right now is to take a sabbatical from the vlog. I'm trying to put this weekend behind me, think about things. I've cut together some stuff from our trip this weekend. When I was in that basement, I was so alone and scared and I just kept thinking about how alone and scared Meghan Kim must have been. I'm sorry, this footage is crap. Nic would have done a much better job editing it. But I... I decided to do a short documentary like this on the homeless issue in downtown. Just, I need to try and put something positive out into the world for a change. I need to try to come to terms with what I know about my birth father. Which means I might lose the sponsorship. But if I do, I mean, so be it. Come on, turn on. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh fuck, fuck. Jess! Jess, is that you? Yo, bitches. Terrible Tyler here. And today, I am stoked to find DropTheMike's actual crib, where his fiance was decapitated. Sick! And what's even sicker is that DropTheMike totally bolted. Cops can't find him anywhere. How epic is that? Dude, it says do not cross. Dude. Not anymore. Tune in tonight where I try to find out what happened to DropTheMic and I'll show you how I got this awesome artifact. Like, comment, and subscribe to my channel, bitches. I post new videos every Monday. Peace!
