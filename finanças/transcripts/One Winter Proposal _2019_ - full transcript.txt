Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM Happy New Year's Eve to you too. You've been shopping. I couldn't show up to the party tonight empty-handed. Well, I have been shopping too. - Suits me, no? - Like a crown to a queen. Is this what I think it is? I've been waiting for you to open it. Cara, this is, I'm so proud of you. It's just a mock-up. I still have to give them my final approval. - What are you waiting for? - There's still a lot to go over. The botched heist, the confession in chapter 16, the new ending... - New ending? - Yeah. I can't wait to see what you think. You can borrow this one as long as you promise to give it back. I don't know, this could be worth a lot of money some day. Ben! Okay, fine. Fine, I promise I'll give it back. That's what I thought. Great. Thanks. - Megan. - Yes. Syndra needs new cover shots by this afternoon. What? You finished those already. Yeah, there's a problem with the aspect ratio. Okay, book the cyc wall, call the rental house to deliver the lights, and get IT over there to make sure they shoot in the right format this time. And do you want green or white cyc walls? White, unless they want the model photoshoped onto the moon. And send Ariana's publicist some flowers. Isn't that talent relation's job? Yeah, they're a little bogged down right now. - I told them we could help out. - Oh yeah, we're not? Please and thank you, Ethan. A quick question. When you run out of ink making a checklist, do you think the checklist might be too long? It just means we're gonna have a particularly productive afternoon. You don't have to say yes to everything, you know. I don't say yes to everything. Hi, this is Megan from Hayden Layne magazine, we're gonna need to push print just a teensy little... I, no, yes, I... Which one do you like? No no no. I want your fresh opinion. No pressure, it's only the logo for my company. Well, this one's my favorite. - You like that one? - I mean, they're all nice. No I'm just kidding, that's the one I picked too. I don't know why you need my opinion anyway. I didn't found one of the biggest snowboarding companies in the world. And then quit to start maybe the smallest snowboard company in the world? Maybe but this company has charm. - That's good. - You like that? I could use that for my pitch with Porter Mason. You got your meeting! - Good news, bad news. - What? He is gonna be up at Clara Lake so he wants to do it while we're there. That's not bad news. Yeah, but this trip is supposed to be a vacation. You go back to your graduate program in a couple of weeks... Ben, this is a big deal. And when you land your big deal with Porter, it'll just be another thing to celebrate. And since you're working, maybe I can invite Megan. - Yeah, that's a great idea. - Yeah? Right. Well, I'll ask her tonight. If anyone could use a vacation, it's her. Okay, I'm gonna get these printed. - Looks great. - Thanks. - I'll see you tonight. - See you tonight. Hot off the presses, Syndra. Two finals for your cover layout. You're a life saver. I know it's New Year's Eve. Hope it wasn't too much trouble. Oh no, not at all. And design's ready to pull the trigger whenever you are. How did Mallory magazine let us steal you? - Will that be everything? - Believe so. You two have fun tonight. - Thank you. - Thank you. Syndra. What's all of this? I'm just mocking up some panels for our travel section. - We don't have a travel section. - We do now. More women are looking to explore the world, I think we should be a part of that. Was hoping to debut it in February, but just been so slammed. We'd love to help. I know it's not the job of an operations manager but... No, it's not that. You would mock up an entire section in two weeks, on top of what you're already doing? Sure. Ethan and I can handle that, right? - When do you sleep? - Sleep is overrated. We're on this. Here, give me that. Happy New Year! - Told you you always say yes. - Technically, I said sure. Two weeks to mock up an entire section, that's not even... You minored in photography, right? - Yeah. - Great, you're hired. Rent whatever camera lenses and equipment you need. - What am I taking pictures of? - Surprise me. And Amanda! I was just gonna hunt you down. Hey, Megan. - Happy New Year's Eve. - Happy New Year's Eve to you too. Have you finished the review for the Cara Reneau novel? Almost. Okay. When you're finished, send it over my way. She's a good friend of mine, I'm really excited to hear what you have to say about it. - Of course. - Great. Speak of the devil. Hi! I was just gonna call you. Megan! Are you free yet? That's what I was gonna call you about. Don't tell me. I know I said I was gonna help you pick out a dress but... They heaped even more work on you? I really need to get a head start on this. - Meet you at the party? - Fine. I guess I'll have to pick out my dress on my own. I'm leaning towards leopard print. Cara. I think the style's coming back in, no? Okay, okay. I'm coming right over. Do not leave the house wearing anything with spots. Deal. I'll see you soon. See you soon. Leopard print. Your apartment looks like a changing room on Black Friday. Just being thorough. All the dresses are great on you, why all the stress? I'm not stressed, it's just, this is my first New Years with Ben. New Years is when people start thinking about things, like the future... Yeah well, Ben loves you whether you're wearing a Versace dress or a burlap sack. - Even a leopard print? - Don't wear the leopard print. What's this? - This is your dress. - Yes. - You're a pro. - That's what I do. Did you come up with a plus one yet? Been a bit busy for that! - What about Sean? - Sean? - What made you think of him? - I always liked you two together. Yeah well, you know, things happen, phone tag, email tag, smoke signal tag. He was a great guy. What was that? Nothing. You look ready to go. - Your turn. - Okay. I got a good one. Hey! You look beautiful. Sorry we're late, it's all my fault. Yeah. Cara had to make sure every dress she owns still fits. - So great to see you, Megan. - You too. If feels like we never get a chance to hang out anymore now - that I'm at Hayden Layne. - Yes, going well? Now, they're keeping my plate full that's for sure. Well, hey, let me keep your glass full. Yeah. Okay. Exactly how I wanted to end the year. - And what a year it was. - No kidding. Last New Years you swore off dating, I was an assistant at Mallory Magazine, and you were trying to save your job at Cyan. - Cheers to failed resolutions. - Cheers. For the better I hope. Sean, I'm so glad you could make it. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, Megan! - Sean. - It's been... - Yeah. So. Still conquering the world one magazine at a time? Yeah. These operations, they don't manage themselves. You're still putting people back together? Surgeons, we're basically carpenters, only less precise. Less precise? I let you set my wrist. - And look at you, full recovery. - Small miracles. Hey look, I'm so sorry about all the phone tag. And I'm sorry about the missed emails. And I'm sorry about that time I had to cancel, remember, work was just crazy. And I'm sorry I had to cancel the time after that. Is it fair to say that we're both sorry then? More than fair. Well, then let's get you a glass of wine. - Cabernet? - Yeah. You're kidding me. No word of a lie, there must have been at least 10 raccoons on our campsite. 10. - You counted? - Oh yeah. There's the mama, the papa, the auntie, the uncle, the twins came. Yeah, everyone was there. So this week, after New Years you busy? Actually, I'm moving. Yeah. Took a job at a new practice. Less surgery, more patient care. I'm excited. That's great. I'm happy for you. - You're missing the pretty view. - No, I'm not. 10. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, Ben. - Happy New Year, Cara. Yeah. Thank you. You ever feel like you finally have a handle on your life? No. What's that like? Have you given Clara Lake anymore thought? Leave on Thursday, be a long weekend of food, fun and snowboarding. Cara, I wish I could... And plus it'll be like the one year anniversary of us all getting stuck in the chalet together. It'll be like a reunion. Trust me, there's nothing more I'd rather do, but with work and everything... I get it. Besides, it'll be nice for you and Ben to get away together. Sure. Yeah. And he'll be working and trying to sell his new prototype. Who will I have fondue with? That Creamy Swiss cheese. You remember that Belgian chocolate... Okay, okay, stop. Stop. I'll talk to Syndra, maybe we can work something out. - Maybe. - Maybe. It's just weird is all I'm saying. I read the new ending to Cara's book. You're overthinking this. In Cara's old ending, the two detectives get married and live happily ever after. In the new ending, they go their separate ways. And? And I've always kind of felt like the two detectives were based on me and Cara. You don't know that for sure. Detective Brad Langston, Ben Livingston, same initials. Okay. Hardly conclusive, detective. You're right. I know I'm being crazy. It's just all this stuff with Charmed must just kind of have my head spinning. You're still bringing the ring though, right? Yeah of course. I'm planning something big. As soon as I'm done with Porter I'm gonna... Drop to a knee and get a jump start - on your happily ever after. - Exactly. Alright okay, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. - Hey. - Hi! You're all packed up? Yeah, just gonna load up the board prototypes. We're good to go. - Great. - Have you heard from Megan? Nah, I haven't heard from her yet. Speaking of. Megan! Hi! Guess what? I can come. Really? How'd you swing it? We're launching a new travel section, and I sold Syndra on Clara Lake being our first layout. - So you still have to work. - Yeah. And I can only come for one day. But, you know, it's better than nothing. Hey, I'll take what I can get. Well, Ethan and I are on our way. Great. Well next time I see you, it'll be against the backdrop of powdered slopes. I can't wait. Great. In short, the new technology makes boards more accessible. At Charmed Snowboards we believe there's room on the mountain for everyone. Mr. Livingston, in all my years of hearing pitches, I've never been so blown away. I'm sure that's exactly what Porter's gonna say. Hey, I'm convinced. We spent a lot of money developing this new board. If Porter doesn't invest, we're pretty much sunk. Have you thought of a name for the new board yet? Of course. Hundreds. You know you only need one. What time's the pitch? This afternoon. Sorry, I don't want this whole trip to be about work. I'll just get this over with, and the rest of the weekend will be about us. Can you believe it's only been a year? Feels like yesterday. - You even booked the same chalet? - It seemed appropriate. Home sweet home. And no gift basket. I guess Charmed Snowboards doesn't have quite the same swing as Cyan. I was only in it for the gift baskets. Extra motivation to get Charmed gift basket worthy. You even booked the same cabin? Amazing. I said the same thing! I'm so glad you made it. Me too! - Good to see you. - Hi! Got you loaded up. Alright, I'm gonna go unload these bags and get some test shots. Right, we got a lot of ground to cover. Excuse me. Hey, Cara, wasn't there something you forgot to pack? Right. Medical tape. Yeah, I was gonna wrap my ankle before we hit the slopes. You hurt your ankle? Nothing serious, just wear and tear. I bet the infirmary has some. Megan, you were there last year. How could I forget when Sean was all roller derby on the slopes. Do you remember where it is cause I was just gonna head there... No no no. I'll go get some for you. Oh no, you don't have to do that. No no. You should rest your ankle. - Are you sure? - Yeah, what are friends for? - Be right back. - Okay. You're good. - Got her to the infirmary, didn't I? - She really can't say no. Finally getting your rematch with this fire pit. - This time I got a secret weapon. - Oh yeah, what's that? A lighter. A lighter to start a fire? Revolutionary. Shoot. I think I must have left it in the other coat. I'll get it. Don't want you to be without your secret weapon. Hello? Anybody here? I'm just gonna get some medical tape. Sorry, ma'am. I was just... Sean, what are you doing here? I work here. What are you doing here? Wait, your new job's at the resort? To good wine and better company. Not so bad yourself. But you know what? Something is missing. I believe, I believe this is yours. The pineapple. It's the most guarded of all the fruits, but under the surface, the sweetest of them all. Wine charms. Last year you hated them and this year you're naming companies after them. That's an acquired taste I have since acquired. - To all the charms in our lives. - Charming. I have a feeling this will be a weekend we'll remember for a long time. Well. - Hi! - Hi. So good to see you. I had no idea your new job was here? You never mentioned that during New Years. Well, the countdown to midnight sort of interrupted us. Right. So how's the new job going so far? Well it's only my first week, but I'm sure it'll be... Just what the doctor ordered? Funny us being here again together, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it's great. Work's been crazy. Feel like I haven't had a day off since last year. Oh yeah. I hear you. That's partially why I decided to move up here. Traded in skyscrapers for mountains. - Surgeries for snow rash. - Yeah. Excuse me. Work never stops. Try not answering those once in a while. See how it makes it feel. Nah, that's not happening. You're not taking this away from me this time. Just don't fracture your wrist again. You're planning on running into me again. I don't plan on it. - Appreciate it. - Yeah. So, what's up? I need to get some medical tape. Cara has a bad ankle and... Yeah I thought you weren't gonna be able to make it up here with Ben and Cara this weekend? Wait, they know you work here? They didn't mention that to me. I mean, my shift is just about over, I mean, we could go grab some coffee or... Or you can come to the chalet and say hello to everyone. Yeah, that'd be great. It will be. I read the new ending to your book. Oh yeah, what'd you think? It's much more open-ended. Gotta leave something for the sequel. You don't think the two detectives should end up together at the end? That was my first instinct, but I don't think there's any rush, do you? No. No I guess not. Hey ya'll! Hey! - Sean! - Hey, Sean! I was hoping you'd stop by. Ye olde chalet. Wouldn't change a thing. - Cabernet? - Please. You forgot to mention Sean's new job. - Did I? - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Megs, I'm just about ready to... hi there. Sean, this is Ethan. Ethan, this is Sean. Sean's a doctor here at the resort. Well, it's great to meet you, hope I won't have to see you too often. What do you mean? Just that I don't wanna end up in the infirmary? Yeah. Hope for the best there. Ethan works with me at Hayden Layne magazine. Ethan, doesn't your girlfriend work at the magazine too? - Nope, she's a teacher. - Right. Yes, Ethan has a girlfriend, and she's a teacher. Well, it's fantastic that we're all under the same roof again, but we need to shoot while we still have daylight. Right, just give me five minutes and I'll get all the gear together. Okay. Sean should go with you. Now that he works here, he must know some great views. I've only been working here three days. Three days longer than Megan. Alright. I may have heard of a couple lookouts. - Perfect. - Perfect. - Grape? - Grape. Grapes. I'm gonna get some air. I know what you're doing. I have no idea what you're talking about. Guess what I found in Ben's pocket? - I'm afraid to ask. - A receipt. Great. So we know he shops. To a jewelry store. You don't think... Okay, hold on, hold on. How do you know it's not for some other piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace? I thought that at first and then I saw the price. - Too high? - Too low. He couldn't buy anything for that price at that store. Wait, then he couldn't have bought a ring. He couldn't have bought a ring but it was just enough to resize a ring. Add up all the clues, and it equals one thing. Proposal. She's gonna figure it out. Not this time man. I'm finally gonna surprise her. Okay. Forgive me for being skeptical but you can barely surprise her with a cup of coffee in the morning, let alone a proposal. I'm paying cash for the flowers. They're keeping the dress at the concierge. - There's a dress? - There's a dress. I called up Denise's wedding planner, who put me in touch with her dressmaker, who gave me the size to Cara's bridesmaid dress. Wait, you didn't tell him you found the receipt, did you? - No way, not after my birthday. - Yeah. You should have acted surprised. He called to say he was working late, and I heard a foghorn. He doesn't even work anywhere near the water. Anyone could have seen that coming. Okay, I should have acted surprised. Yeah. But this time, I'm gonna play it cool. - What about the ring? - It's my mother's. Drove 40 miles just to get it resized, just to make sure Cara would never find out. Yeah. She's definitely gonna find out. Not this time man. I'm telling you she has no idea. Hey, Megan. I'm all ready. Great. - We better get going, Sean. - Yeah. Have fun you guys. I wasn't sure you were gonna pull that off. Less Cupid's arrow more Cupid throwing darts at a dart board. Oh shoot, I need to get ready to meet up with Porter. - Great, good luck. - Thanks. I've been wanting to walk around. Re-acclimate. Okay, I got a surprise for you after my meeting. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. You sure you don't want some help? Nah, thanks, I'm good. Yeah, he minored in photography. Careful. He missed me. It's so beautiful here. Some really great views from the west point, we just take the chair lift up. - Just a short walk from there. - Okay. You'll get some really nice shots. Sounds perfect. Hey, I forgot my light meter. You guys take this one up, I'll be right behind you. Yeah, it's okay, I'll be right back. - Wait. - Yeah, okay. Okay. - This way. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. - You go. - No no no, you go. - No you go. - Ladies first. I forgot what I was gonna say. So. This'll work? This will definitely work. How'd you even find this place? Ski patrol told me about it. But I've never been up here. Think I might come back, like every day. Here, let me see that. That's great. Maybe try putting the peak on the right side of frame. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay, let me see that. Yeah. - Are you using a filter? - What? I... Because aren't polarizing filters good for outdoor photography? Right, but I'm using a grading filter on this lens. - I see. - Yeah. Okay well, maybe do something a little bit more like here. More sky. You know? Okay. - And what F-stop are you using? - F-stop I'm using, yeah. - Hey, Megan. - Yeah, one minute. - Aha. - No it's okay. Megan, I got it. More sky. I got something I'd love to show you just over here. Sure. Ethan, I'll be right back. - You got it. - He is fine. So, what did you want me to see? Nothing, just an excuse to get you away from Ethan. - Excuse me, but I'm working. - Were you? Cause it looked to me like you were hovering. I was not hovering. You were kinda doing this thing where you were like, like, doing this thing where you were, kind of looking, but then you were kind of peeking and poking. Sean, I was not... Could just do this thing? Could I do this thing? Okay. Okay. Okay. I was not hovering. I mean maybe. Fine, maybe I was hovering just a little bit. Just a little bit. Hey so, I've got the morning shift again tomorrow, but if you got time, late lunch? I wish I could but I'm driving back to Seattle tomorrow. So soon? Just too bad we don't have more time. Yeah, too bad. What do you think? Your prototype feels amazing. It's like floating on air. That's what I was going for. - Hot chocolate? - You read my mind. You know what, you should get Porter on a board because that would really seal the deal. You know, the funny thing about most of these execs is, they don't even snowboard. Well, they don't know what they're missing. Two, please. Thanks. Thank you. - So... - So? - How'd the pitch go with Porter? - He rescheduled for tomorrow. What? Why? That's fine. He's a busy guy. We'll meet up tomorrow. You mentioned something about a surprise. You know what it is, don't you? - You don't have to pretend. - No. I don't have a clue. I was afraid you're gonna figure it out, but I knew I had to wait until we were up here. This is something, before I met you, I never saw myself doing. But you've inspired me, and for that I'm forever thankful. It's a helmet. - For snowboarding. - It's not just any helmet. Look at the back. It's a hole for a ponytail. Remember? It was your idea. Right! That's great! Try it on. It's one of our company's launch products. Yeah? Really? Fingers crossed. I've wanted one of these for years. - Looks great on you. - Yeah? Great! Thank you. Really. - This means a lot. - Yeah. I don't know what I missed. I was sure he was gonna propose. You can't be right every time. And how awesome is it that he used your idea for the helmet. I know. That was so sweet. I probably came off like a total jerk. No I'm sure you were fine. So? Did you have a good time with Sean? The best. I forgot how charming, and smart, and funny he is. - And handsome. - Don't even remind me. I would think these were good things. Yeah that's good, but he is here now, I'm in Seattle. So when I leave tomorrow, the carriage turns back into a pumpkin. It means a lot to me that you came, even if it was for only one day. I'd sail across the ocean for you. I expected her to be a little more excited. The helmet was her idea. You know... I'm sure she's just worried about the book. The book is great, she has nothing to worry about. Then why are you worried about it? - What? - The new ending. - I'm not worried about that. - Good. Afraid you were gonna spend the weekend trying to play a matchmaker with fictional characters. Nope, just you and Megan. Looks like you had a good time. She's amazing, and funny, and smart, and... Single. I was gonna say lives in Seattle. Hey, we'll shoot around the Lodge the rest of the morning, should be able to get back to Seattle by tonight. Trust me, it's a much more fun skiing on the slopes than it is in the trees. - How does that feel? - Good. No more snowboarding for at least 48 hours. Okay. - Make sure she gets some rest. - Skiing's all right though? What? No! No skiing, no boarding, no tobogganing, no snow angels. Okay, thank you. - Hey there. - Hey. Needed more medical tape for your drive back? Actually, Ethan and I got to talking and we figured there's more to travel ...than just what you see. What about the other senses? I'm sure they're feeling very neglected. Ha ha, very funny. I mean, sure travel is about sightseeing, but it's also about what you taste, and what you hear, and what you feel. Right. We figured if we're gonna capture all of that, we're gonna need more time here. - You're staying? - Yeah. - That's great! - Yeah. I mean, more time for you to explore all that. So we're still on for that late lunch? Yeah. Look a little bound up there. Yeah. Not having much luck. I could maybe help. Sometimes ice gets caked in the bindings, just gotta knock it off, and presto! Thanks so much. Thought I was going to wear my board home. - I'm Lisa. - I'm Cara. First time on a snowboard if you couldn't tell. Everyone starts somewhere. I wish I could go somewhere, haven't even made it down the bunny hill yet. Well, I could give you some tips if you want. You know, I was determined to do this on my own, but who am I trying to impress, I'll take whatever help I can get. - Let's do it. - Okay. - Let's start with those boots. - Yeah. How's that feel? Like Cinderella's step-sister jamming her foot in the glass slipper. Great, that means it's perfect. Great. Your other ones were way too big. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. So Cara, what do you do besides give snowboard lessons to strangers? I'm a writer. Sort of. My first book hasn't been released yet. You write. You're a writer. I think there's more to it than that, don't you? Please, you get me down the bunny slope, I'm putting snowboarder on my business card. Okay, fair enough. Well, if you don't mind me asking, why now? Snowboarding? High school graduation. Not mine, my youngest. Seemed like yesterday I was teaching her to tie her shoes. If time's gonna go by so fast, no sense wasting it in my comfort zone. Well, snowboarding doesn't have to be uncomfortable. Maybe for you. If I can careen down a hill strapped to a plank of wood, I feel like I can do anything. Yeah, it's a good point, actually. Snowboard materials are actually getting better and better, - but I like your attitude. - Ben! - What are you doing here? - I just came in for a little inspiration. This must be the boyfriend. Last I checked. Ben Livingston. - Hi. - This is Lisa. She's up here trying to learn how to snowboard. Yeah. May the mountain be warned. Cara's been generous enough to offer some pointers. You're in pretty good hands. She's almost as good as I am. - Really? - Way better. It's great you two can come up here together. Very romantic. Yeah, this is actually the very spot that we met. A year ago. My husband's work has brought him up here for years, but I was always occupied with my own business. - What's your business? - I'm an event planner. Birthdays, bat mitzvahs, weddings too. Hey, Syndra. Megan, the sleepless wonder, how go things on the hill? Great, really great in fact. So great that we need a couple more days here. I mean, if you need me back at the office I'm more than happy to come back. No, I think this is fantastic. You do? You do. Great, great, yes. You know, I was thinking for a full layout, we're gonna need a little bit more time... - Because I was thinking. - Yes? We'll have a print section, but we should have some video elements for the website as well. This is true. If you don't have time... No no no, we're more than happy to help. We can get it done. - Great, see you when you get back. - See you then. - So, what'd she say? - She said we can stay the weekend. - Yeah? - Yeah. And we get to shoot video for the website. So on top of doing a full photo spread, we are now making a video. Exactly. I was hoping you'd forget I had this. It's gonna be hard to buy when it's sold out in every bookstore. Found a typo in the manuscript, making sure they fixed it for the print. I'm driving myself crazy, and the book hasn't even been released yet. It's a big step. Trust me, I understand. Megan's magazine is doing the first review. What if they hate it? Hey, I've had my experiences with bad press. You can't let it get to you. So you think the review will be negative? What? No. Then what did you mean by bad press? - Am I missing something? - No, I'm sorry. Just nervous. You have nothing to be nervous about. Soon the rest of the world is gonna know what I already know. That you are a wonderful writer. Speaking of wonderful, I love this sport coat. Wouldn't want Porter Mason to think he's getting any less than my best. Well, it's working on me. I don't know how you do it. Starting from scratch with a new company. How do you stay so confident? - Everyone has doubts, Cara. - Besides you. You don't think that I wonder how it might have been different if I'd stayed at Cyan? - Do you? - Well, I don't dwell on it. But quitting was a pretty rash decision. Seems to have worked out. Maybe you should make more rash decisions? Remains to be seen. Oh my gosh. - This is so good. - Ben's secret garnish recipe. Honed over many winters, passed on to me, and now to you. Well, thank you so much. Truly honored. So when you're taking these late lunches, who mans the infirmary. They gave me a pager, but it never goes off. Less emergencies up here, I guess. I thought it was broken at first. - A pager? - Yeah. - Seriously? - Yeah. Hello? It's for you. It's the 21st century. - Come on, a pager? - You got me. Hey look, I was thinking. We had fun last year, right? It was the highlight of my year. What if we re-traced our steps. Trivia-night. Indoor camping. No, seriously. Let's replay our hits. Yeah. That's a good idea. Hello, Nikki! How's my girl? Yeah, I'm real excited to see you too. You're gonna have a blast, I'm gonna make sure of it. Yep. See you soon. - That was my niece, Nikki. - Your niece! I'm so sorry, I almost forgot my sister and her husband are coming to the resort. And tomorrow's my day off so I promised I'd hang with Nikki. Your poor niece Nikki. Having to hang out with her uncle all day. Yeah, I don't envy her. Hey, for your information, I'm the cool uncle. Hate to meet the other uncles. It's all good, it's all good, do your thing. I mean, I have a very busy day tomorrow anyways. Hey, I mean, you could join us if you'd like? I'm sure Nikki would love to meet you. Really? I mean, I wouldn't want to infringe on your family time. Oh no, you wouldn't be. Well then, okay. - Hey, Ben. - Porter. I'm so sorry it's been so crazy connecting this weekend. You're a busy guy, I understand. When you were with Cyan our relationship was mutually beneficial. I would love to see that continue. - That makes two of us. - Great. - So what have you got for me? - That's very exciting. I'm so sorry. Hello. No, I said 10,000 units, not 100,000. Okay, I'm on my way. Don't, don't sign anything. Then stall. I'm on my way. Ben, I feel terrible, but is there any way we can re-schedule? I actually have something else planned this weekend. And I feel terrible. Next time you'll have my full attention, I promise. Okay. Sure. How's tomorrow? Tomorrow's no good. Let's try Sunday. - Try Sunday. - Thanks, Ben. You used to run a big company, I knew you'd understand. That's the shot. Oh you blessed ambrosia. I told you. - Ethan, how are we looking? - Even the camera's drooling. Oh yeah. I'd say we can check taste off our Five Senses of Travel? Believe so. Alright. I'm gonna go upload this card. Catch up with you later. Ladies, enjoy. - Thanks, Ethan. - Bye. Thank you so much for doing this. This justifies every switch back driving up through the cascades. Megan's gonna be making that trip a lot more often now. Come on. What? It's nothing, really. You got a thing for a guy who works here. - Okay. - Okay. I'm just being realistic. We're having our fun while I'm here. But then when I go back to reality, it'll be just that, reality. If spending time with someone feels like a fantasy, that's someone worth trying to make a reality. Yeah, but it's a little more complicated than that. Sure you aren't the one making it complicated? Hey, we just met. Take everything I say with a grain of salt. Grain of salt. I'm just someone who's been around the track. I think you're spot on. Don't think you're out of the woods. - What? Me? - Yeah, you. What's the deal with you and the boyfriend? There's no deal, I just misread the situation. I thought he was gonna propose, and I was wrong. Well, from what I hear you're pretty good at picking up signals. It's like her super power. I can't even watch movies with her anymore, she always spoils the ending. Okay, maybe he got cold feet. I know he's stressed with work. What? Your receiver works great. I think you might need to take a look at your transmitter. I don't follow. You're great at picking up on everyone else's signals, but sometimes we give out signals ourselves without even knowing it. You're good. - Hey, Amanda. - Hey, Megan, sorry to call so late. No worries, what's up? Well, I finished the review of Cara Reneau's book. Yes? And? And it's not one hundred positive. I know she's a friend of yours. No worries, you're just doing your job. I'll be sending it to you before I send it to Syndra. Please, give it a read. I will. Thanks, Amanda. - How'd it go with Porter? - Rescheduled again. Seemed to be an emergency over a misplaced decimal. Yikes! Hope he finds it. Well, you never know what tomorrow will bring. That's true. And I happen to know that you are every bit worth the wait. - So, how old is she? - 15. - What's she like? - Uncle Sean! Slick Nick! Welcome to the mountain top. - Hello. - This is my friend, Megan. Remember from the chalet mix-up last year? You're the one who works at Hayden Layne magazine. - Yep, that's me. - That is so cool! So do you get to meet all the stars who do photos and interviews? Sometimes. Can you tell me about them? I'd love to have a job like that. I was thinking I might like to work in fashion one day, or maybe be a vet cause I love animals. Well, you could do both. You could have a magazine about animals. Don't laugh uncle Sean! Yeah, uncle Sean, don't laugh. That would fly off the shelves. Absolutely. Who's the most famous star you've ever met? You got to meet her? She came into the office to shoot a cover. What's she like? Let's just say her voice is even better in person. - She sang? - She sang. Your job sounds amazing. It can be, yeah. These bindings are too big, but we have some smaller ones in the back you can try. Don't go anywhere, I have so many questions. Staying put. I don't think she likes you. - But she's right, you know? - About what? - You are really cool. - Υeah? Says the guy who literally puts people back together. Yeah, but none of my patients ever sing during surgery. Well I should hope not. You know, it's nice to be reminded you have an amazing job. I forget that sometimes. - Pretty stressful? - It can be. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my job. I've just taken on a little too much lately. And now this book review. - A book review is stressing you out? - It's Cara's. I'm the one who offered to have the magazine review it. Never occurred to me that it could be negative. - Have you talked to Cara about it? - No. I haven't actually read it yet, but this weekend is supposed to be fun, I don't want to ruin it with bad news. Ready. - It looks great. - Let's go! How cool is it that one day your book is going to be on these shelves amongst all these classics. I don't know about that. Well, you don't have to know, I do. Everything okay? Remember how Megan's magazine is reviewing my book? Yeah. Apparently the reviewer wasn't exactly blown away. - Did you read the review? - Not yet. I overheard Megan talking to Sean in the pro shop. Cara, you know I love mysteries. We bonded over Agatha Christie. Your book is good, I promise you. What if this dream, being a writer, it's just that, just a dream? What if this is the part where I wake up, and realize how silly this dream has been? The Great Gatsby. Chicago Tribune called it obviously unimportant. It's so unimportant it's now considered one of the greatest novels of all time. On the Road, Jack Kerouac. Truman Capote panned it, called it typing not writing. Didn't stop it from inspiring a bunch of dumb teenage boys to drive across the country, including yours truly. Moby Dick, Brave New World, Three Musketeers, there isn't a book on these shelves that hasn't been criticized. If it's in your heart, no one can touch it. Okay? Okay. Okay. So, if any reason you can't find us, meet us at the information desk - and we'll... - Got it. - See you at the top! - Come find you. It was a good try. - My sister's gonna kill me. - No, she is not. You just need to relax. Isn't that why you moved here? To relax? You mean why I traded in surgeries for snow rash? I had gotten into I guess you'd call it a funk. And I thought back to when was the last time I was truly happy, and it was up here. You know, we're not all like you. Handle everything and still ask for more. Yeah, well, being so much faster than you just gets me a lot of extra time. - So much faster? - So much faster. If you can't find me, I'll be at the information desk. - Okay, I'll see you there. - See you there! In the human body, what is the hallux? Hallux? A, throat. B, hip. C, big toe. D, elbow. You must know this one Uncle Sean, you're a doctor. We're one point behind the lead. I would go with elbow, that's my guess. - Is it elbow? - Big toe. Really? Big toe? You sure? Tied for the lead! - That was intense. - Tell me about it. I got a cramp in my hallux. Alright. It all comes down to this. I know this one. It's D. Now if you're sure, I'll trust you. But if you're not, I need to know like right now. I'm sure uncle Sean. It's D, Stitches. - One hundred percent? - Yes, trust me! Come on, press D. But are you one hundred percent sure though? Come on, press D! - Press D. - Okay, okay. Yes! The word dynasty gets thrown around a lot. Yes, it does. But at this point, it's the only word for the back to back trivia champions. Yes. And we couldn't have done it without Nikki. Slick Nick, coming in with the music knowledge. Lucky I was here. How have you never heard of Sean Mendes? Yeah I thought you were the cool uncle? I've heard of Sean Mendes, but it's just that song, it had like a little thing that I wasn't sure. Well, it was just a pleasure meeting you, Nikki. It was great meeting you, too, Megan. I had fun with you too, uncle Sean. You were right about her. Your parents are waiting outside. You'd better get going before your mother thinks I lost you. - Okay, good night. - Good night. - What did she mean by that? - What did she mean by what? What she said. You were right about her. I told her that you were an excellent trivia partner. Yes of course. Of course. I thought you were just taking video today. These are amazing. Just a man with a camera. - No, you really got something here. - Thanks. What are these? I snapped a few candids on the lookout. - I didn't even notice. - You were distracted. I, I... For our five senses of travel, I was thinking about how we can communicate feeling through a photograph. What if it doesn't have to be so literal? What if we talk about how traveling, getting outside of ourselves can, well, can touch our hearts? That's really good copy. Anyways, these photos of you and Sean, I thought that feeling really came across. I'm sending you the files. You know. So, you can pick your favorites. - Good work today, Ethan. - Thanks. Ethan. Yeah? I think we have everything that we need. You can go home tomorrow. I'll catch a ride with Cara and Ben. Sure thing. Thanks. Good night, Ethan. Hey there. Hey. - Have fun with Sean's niece? - It's like trying to keep up with a hummingbird. But yeah, she was, she was great. Do you know how to make weekends last forever? I can ask around. Is this all Sean and I will ever be? Great weekends once a year if I can fit it into work. You know they made these things called telephones now? They'd let you talk to somebody, even if you're not in the same city. I've seen that movie. I know how it ends. But two great weekends is more than some people get, right? If anybody deserves more, it's you. What about you? Everything okay? What? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Cara Reneau, I know that look, that's not your 'I'm fine' look. I overheard you and Sean talking in the pro shop, about the review. - Cara, I'm so... - No no no no. Don't worry. You didn't want to ruin my vacation. You were just being a good friend. I'll call Syndra. I'll ask her not to print it. You know that I would never exploit our friendship like that. Plus, all press is good press, right? - Morning. - Hey. Hope you had some sleep. Yeah, a few winks here and there. Have you heard from Porter yet? No. Not yet. - Looking good. - I know right? Thank you, for what you said yesterday in the library. - It really meant a lot to me. - I meant every word. Can I take out your board? Yeah, of course. Great. - Good morning, coach. - Morning. What you got there? Remember how you said your board felt heavy? Well, I think I found your secret weapon. Okay. I'm all ears. Just as soon as I get my helmet on. Want to make sure this one actually fits. - Ponytail's so uncomfortable, right? - Here. Try mine. My boyfriend makes one with room for a ponytail in the back. Great. Thanks. Cool. - Great! - Right? Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? Okay. Ready. Yeah. Just make sure they're nice and tight. Alright, let's do this. Got this? - Got it. - Nice. - Okay. - Yeah? This board does feel nice. So much lighter and easier to balance. - Good. - Ben built this? Yeah. His own special recipe. Talk about a keeper. Alright, we're gonna start off nice and easy, okay? - Trusting you here. - Absolutely, here we go. Going down the hill. You got this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There we go. Hey, Lisa. Cara, don't you, no, Cara! - Okay. Okay. - Yeah! Nice. Atta girl! You did it! Yeah, nice! Did I just shred? My husband gave me a Spark snowboard, his company makes them, but I gotta get one of these. If a gal like me can ride it... Everyone starts somewhere. Everyone starts somewhere. What? Every snowboarder, from working moms to gold medalists, everyone starts somewhere. Yeah. Well, you've been looking for a hook to keep the prices low. But Porter's not gonna invest if I can't convince him it's profitable. Yeah but that's just the thing, what does every snowboarder have in common? They all start out as beginners. You could be onto something. Still a few things to iron out. I want to keep the cool factor, but everyone starts somewhere. Now you just need to come up with a name? Right, I've been leaning towards Thunder. Thunder sounds like a racehorse. I don't know. Your board's sleek, and light. The Feather. Feather's kind of delicate. This board is strong, it's dependable. I'll think of something. Thank you, thank you for this. You know, we said that we were going to retrace our steps, and indoor camping was a significant step. It was the last step. - You know what they say. - What's that? All great things must come to an end. I wish it wasn't so. Sean? Yeah? Do you ever think about it? Think about what? Why this, whatever this is, didn't work in Seattle? You were busy, I was busy. We're busy people. I guess I don't see that changing. I mean, I don't know, I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I'm scared that if I don't, it's all gonna go away. It also made it easier. What do you mean? We had such a special time when we were here, that maybe we thought if we went to Seattle, and the magic wasn't there that maybe, maybe being busy was just an excuse not to take the risk. Or maybe we just work too much. Yeah. Maybe. It's not done. I like mine medium rare. Well, I like mine well done. You can breathe a little deeper up here? Yeah, that's the good stuff. - Do you remember Camp Snow? - Sure. They help underprivileged kids go snowboarding. Yeah. The smiles on those kids' faces, doing something they thought they'd never be able to do. You've always been very generous. Yeah but those kids, they go home with black diamonds shining in their eyes. Then they find out what the equipment costs. Don't ever feel like you haven't given enough. But with my new polymer, those same kids, they could finally afford a board of their own. That's why this is so important to me. There's room on the mountain for everyone. That's more than just a slogan to me, Cara. Charmed is more than just a business to me, the way your novel is more than just a book to you. Yeah. I live every detail, the way you live every word, right? So why did you change the ending? Because my publisher asked me to. Your publisher asked you to take out the proposal? Well, not exactly. I mean, they asked for something more open-ended, so that was my idea. What's this about? Sorry. Forget I said anything. Wait, is there something you don't like about the ending? Am I crazy to think that those characters are based on us? Wait, is that why you didn't...? No, Ben, they're just, they're just characters, they're not based on us. Not at all? I mean, sure every writer draws from their life somewhat but I don't remember us foiling a jewel heist. So you changing the ending, it was just a business decision? Yeah, what else would it be? I'm sorry, Cara. It just feels like more than that. What, so you think I broke up the detectives because I secretly don't love you? - No, that's not what I'm saying. - Then what are you saying, Ben? What I'm saying is, is it possible, maybe, that there's something in that ending, some question you're trying to answer for yourself? Everyone gets cold feet sometimes, but I don't think you can blame my book for that. What do you mean cold feet? You know, like if you were planning on asking me something important, and then decided not to. Wait. You know about the... ...how? I found the receipt in your jacket, from the jewelry store. There is no surprising you, is there? I don't know why I even try. So it's not a surprise. Is it really that big of a deal? Yeah. Actually, this is a big deal. This weekend has been a big deal for me. I can't believe I fought with Cara over fictional characters. I used to fight with my sister over who got to be T-Rex when we played dinosaurs. Am I losing my mind? Nah. You gotta have a mind to lose first. You know, you've always been my idol? - Come on. - I mean it. You're like an action star, always diving into the great unknown. But this Ben, the one who overthinks, this isn't you. I mean, the Ben I know, an investor reschedules on him twice, he takes his business elsewhere. And to think you were always my hero. Guy, you don't have to say it just cause I said it. High stress job, people putting their lives in your hands, and you never let it get it to you. Always a smile. You ever seen a duck swimming? Yeah? Above the water, calm. Below the water, those legs are just churning up a storm. Okay? What I'm trying to say is, any peace you thought I had, I didn't. I just kept doing what I had to do anyway. If the detective steals the crown jewels, is he gonna look at me sideways for buying a ticket to England? Well, he thought the characters were based on the two of you, and then you broke them up. Of course he's gonna wonder what that means. But that's the thing, the characters aren't based on us. What? Detective Brad Langston. Yeah. Brad Langston, Ben Livingston. Same initials. Now I know why I'm always mistaken for Cal Ripken. It's not just the initials, Cara. It's, it's... I mean sure Brad Langston is handsome, and caring, and generous but Brad like burritos, Ben likes bratwursts. He's based on Ben. How did I not see that? Honestly girl, you're the only one. But I want Ben to propose, I wouldn't have changed the ending to tell him not to. Connection's scary. Sometimes in ways we don't even notice we sabotage things to avoid the risk of being hurt. - How could I be so stupid? - No no no. You're not stupid, you're the smartest, most talented person I know. Talented enough to write a novel that critics hate. It was one critic, and she didn't hate it. - You read the review? - I did, this morning. And you should too. I don't think I'm up for that right now. Read it. I'm gonna hit the slopes. One last time, before I have to go back to reality. Cara Reneau's novel, The Girl Who Knew Too Much, is one of the most promising debuts in the mystery genre for quite some time, a fact which makes its late missteps all the more confounding. Tautly written, rife with subterfuge and reveals, its heart is what makes it truly appealing. It's a story about how sometimes to solve a mystery we must stop looking without, and start looking within. Nimbly weaving between intrigue and romance, the story challenges us to break through the outer shells of its characters, the armor we all wear in our daily lives, to uncover the truth inside. The heart is the prize beneath the veneer, and finally the key to solving the mystery. Reneau lets not a single word astray until the final chapter, when the two lead detectives, inexplicably break away. A novel which argues so convincingly for our heart's power to overcome our fears, forgets its own lesson in the final pages. Hey, Porter. Meet me in the library in 30 minutes. I'll be there. And if you want to be a part of this, you will be too, or I'm going with someone else. Fine, you can have 35. - Hey. - Hey. Sean told me I'd find you here. Look, I know you don't have a lot of time, but I had something I wanted to say. Yeah me too. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have walked out like that. When you really care about something, it's like a bird sitting on your shoulder. And you're afraid to move, because you know that there's a chance that it might fly away. But the truth is, the bird can fly away. So you might as well move, and trust that it'll stay. Good luck with your proposal. Thanks. And if you get stuck, you can always tell him that Lisa liked your board way better than her Spark. Cara. Lisa rode a Spark? That's a pretty high-end board for a beginner. Yeah, she said that her husband makes them. - Porter Mason makes Sparks. - Wait, Lisa is... Porter's wife. - How long until Porter's here? - It should be about 15 minutes. I need 25. You think you can stall? Easily. I have plenty of material. - Hello? - Megan! Hi, Syndra. How are you? Fantastic. I love the photo spread for the resort. Good, good. Ethan sent me what the two of put together. Travel Through the Five Senses. It looks amazing. Great. Thank you. Travel section is a go. I'll edit, and you'll manage production. I know you're already slammed as operations manager, but if anyone can pull it off, it's you. No. - What? - I'm sorry, I can't do both. Really? I'm sorry, Syndra. I just don't have the time. And Ethan's great. He's over-qualified working under me right now. You should really let him take the travel section. Well okay, so you'll only do twice as much work as anyone else instead of three times as much. Feel free to send me two paychecks. Sorry, you're breaking up. Hey, Syndra. Thanks for listening. - I'll see you at the office. - Can't wait. Look out! Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I couldn't stop myself. I... You gotta be kidding me. Well, looks like we can retire all those jokes about me running into you last year. Are you okay? Let me, I don't know, I gotta check. - I might have a little... - No. - I might need to see the doctor. - Okay, who do I call? - Sean, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. And that's how you justify the cost but keep the low price point. From Seattle to the Swiss Alps, everyone starts somewhere. A board for beginners. It's a board for everyone. Does this thing have a name? It's strong, light, graceful, feels like a part of you. And she'll carry you to places you could only dream. The Wing. The Wing. That's good. But if I'm going into production on this scale, I need to see this thing in action. I thought you might say that. Come with me. See anyone you know? Lisa? - You got this. - Okay. With this board and helmet I feel like I could fly! Here goes! She looks like a natural. Everyone starts somewhere. Yeah! Alright! - I think you're ready? - Yeah, you're right. - I know. - That was really... Honey, that was incredible. - Thanks. - Thanks. Between Ben's board, and a few lessons from my coach back there, I had a lot of help. - I am impressed. - And look at this great helmet. It actually fits with a ponytail. You have no idea what a pain it is otherwise. It's another prototype. Well, this settles it. I want to start making these boards, and these helmets, as quickly as possible. What do you say, Ben? Spread our Wings? I say that sounds great. Ben, if you ever doubted yourself after leaving Cyan, you're the only one. The rest of this industry knows you're the real deal. I'm so proud of you. - Am I doing this right? - Absolutely. That's all it takes to be a doctor. Just moving things around and poking randomly. Well I don't know. - Megan, I'm fine. - Okay. I was actually hoping I'd run into you. Sorry I beat you to the punch. Megan. When I told you the last time I was truly happy it was up here, I was telling the truth. But I realize now that it wasn't just being up here that made me happy, it was being with you. I feel the same way too, Sean. No one's filled my vacancy at the hospital, I could come back to Seattle. Let's take this thing seriously. This weekend, I realized that I've been putting my career in front of people who are really important to me. So I guess what I'm saying is, no more missed connections. It's Ben. Hello? Hey, Sean. Are you with Megan? - She's around. - Great. I need Cara out of the chalet for a couple hours. You remember that plan I told you about? It's back on. Really? Yeah. We're on it. I need your help with something. No, I know why you wanted the new ending but it's truer to the characters if they end up together. Great, thanks for being so understanding. Any chance you can get Amanda to write a second review on the manuscript? They're letting you go back to the old ending? Well, it took some convincing but the publishers are sending up a new mock-up. I'm proud of you, Cara. I am wiped. How long were we out there? Two, three hours? Was it that long? Time flies on a snowboard. I'm glad we just got some uninterrupted fun. Yes. Just like the good old days. Alright. Well I guess I'm gonna head back to the chalet. - Okay. - You're gonna come? No, I'm just gonna catch up with some work. Work? Really? Cause that just looks like pictures of you and Sean. Alright. What did I do to deserve a friend like you? - I guess you're just lucky. - You got that right. Alright. - See ya. - See ya. Agatha Christie. I was reading it last year. You tried to spoil the ending. This is incredible. I've read it twice since then, even though I know what happens. And I realize, even if I can't surprise you, it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the story. How did you do all this? I had a little help from Sean. I had a lot of help from Sean. Cara. You are the single most unbelievable person I've ever met in my life. Oh gosh. And I don't know where this story goes, but all I know is if we're together, it will have a happy ending. Cara Reneau... Will you marry me? - You know you got one thing wrong. - What? You surprise me every day with how wonderful you are. Of course I'll marry you. Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM
