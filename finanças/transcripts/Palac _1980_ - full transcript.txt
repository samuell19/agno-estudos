Film Group 'Perspektywa' presents The Palace Based on the novel by W. Mysliwski Starring: Production: Photography: Written and directed by: Jacob Well, to your health, Jacob! Is there anyone there? Is there anyone there?! Oh, Jacob... If you had at least trained as a manservant... I could... ...die in peace. Knowing you've become a man. Try and sneak one day into the garden with a sling. Kill a bird. Pick up the little corpse, and take it to the ladies. Say, once again, some rogue shot a bird in the park and you came along, and found it. Or if it should ever happen that carriage horses spook and bolt, and you were leading your flock along the road, don't spare your legs or your arms, but leap, and grab fast onto the horses' manes, and don't let go. Don't let go until you've stopped them. Remember! Even if they were to trample you to death. Better that than this life of ours. Once again, some rogue shot a bird in the park. I was walking by, and I found it, your ladyships. It feels like an oven. What a sultry, scorching day... ...isn't it, cousin? My lord, the ewe is lambing. Here you go. Eat something. Give it to them. They are many, but there's one of you. Eat something. I can do without. Where are you off to? I'll go to the palace. I'll go and see his lordship. I shall write a letter to the prince. Write. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. With the first words of this letter, I ask you, prince, how is your health... ...and whether the mare has given birth? No! Not like that. No... Start over. Like this. No... no... I'll write it tomorrow. What's new at the palace? Be precise. What is her ladyship doing? The priest is visiting with her ladyship. The priest again? What are they doing? Praying? Did you hear her laugh? What was he telling her? "To you, one could pray day and night, in you alone confide among all the saints. " Such a priest has the gift of words. Not like the common man. You're going to paint me. But not any which way it strikes your fancy, but the way I tell you to. In return, you will be lodged in the palace, in a room of your own. You will eat whatever you want; drink to your heart's content. Find yourself a wench. What I am saying... A wench! Even a lady! I'll have a coat made for you. You'll get your own carriage. Four horses... and a footman. Well... What else do you need? Speak up! Nothing, my lord, nothing... Only light... I'll have a wall taken down... But you'll be painting from dawn to dusk. I need to be fat, you see. A double chin spilling over my collar. My cheeks: milk and blood. And before me, my two hands... white and plump. My body will spill out of the chair. The horse will buckle under my weight. Carriage wheels will dig into the ground. And when you portray me asleep my dream will hover over my head. And what will you be dreaming about, my lord? You must paint something pious. His lordship must not have impure dreams. Perhaps I'll be kneeling in a chapel, before the main altar, my lips moving in ceaseless prayers, my eyes shut in humility... I'm even beating my breast Like this. Should I also paint your laughter, my lord? Paint it. You are so beautiful, my lady... that you should be among the chapel saints. My lady... say a word... I can't live without you... say a word, you hear? My husband, my lord... what does it mean when one dreams of a shepherd? I'll put the end to it. I'll kill you, I'll kill you! I'll kill you... Swear, never again! I swear! Don't be afraid, Jacob. I didn't want anything from you. I only wanted you to come, because I felt lonely. I thought you, too, might have left me in hardship, and robbed me to boot. Perhaps you thought I was gone. That I had fled, my horses foaming at the mouth. Is no one faithful anymore? The palace gates are ajar, and everything is yours. Drink and play, the master's away! But I'm here, God willing. Safe and sound. I... For I won't be rid of easily. Tear me out of your memory, and I'll remain in your humility. In your fear. In your dreams. And perhaps in your longings. You've given too much heed to your curses, your hatred, your prayers, your omens, your auguries, and believed I'm no longer over you... But here I am. God willing... Where would I run to? And why? Fools! I had only gone hunting. I returned and waited for someone to pull my shoes off, to serve me some tea, and ask... Well... Ask what? Did you have a successful hunt, my lord? I did. I did. Give your rifles to the beaters. Let them have some fun. We are the beaters, my lord. We track and rouse fowl and game. As you asked us to. What are we to do with the sacred rifles? We, who curse our fathers for having brought us into this world... who curse our children for having been born... we, who remember that as we curse them so they will be cursing us... what are we to do, your lordship, with the sacred rifles? Enough! Enough! A beautiful death sometimes makes the whole life worthwhile. Sometimes, that death is all that remains of life. Oftentimes, one must await death to truly feel that one is human. You're staring at me as if you've just learned that death exists. And it does. Are you afraid of death? Everyone's afraid, my lord. I'm not afraid of death. I'm only afraid of commonplace death, because one could doubt whether it was his lordship who died or his servant. And that would be worse than death. What is death? You can know it only insofar as you fear it. You can't put death into words. All speculations are vain. Better tell me, what do people say about me? Nothing. Nothing? Don't they say I'm miserly? foolish? a villan? a scoundrel? Go on... Don't be afraid. I am afraid. It's not your fault what they say. I know them well. They'd happily drown me in a teaspoon. But when the bishop comes to visit, I'll have them stand in two rows in front of the palace to receive his blessing. They're brimming with hatred. They need holy water and penance. Now... Tell me then... don't they gossip... you know what about... Well, they say that if a girl strikes your fancy she'll soon be in your chamber. Don't say anything to to her ladyship. It would cause her too much pain. Not much of a ladyship now... You were always ill... tired... sleepy... Always something aching... You can't even imagine what a country girl is capable of. It pains me to give you away. It makes my eyes well up with tears Even though she's mine, this is the law. Be merciful, and let me wait for her. You'll be waiting a long while. Better go to a wedding, enjoy yourself. Time will pass quicker. Do as you will, my lord, but let me wait. This is not a rabbit hunt. I'm not in a hurry. She won't be free before morning. I will wait, my lord, until you're bored with her. And you will be, for sure. And what will you do if she has a bastard child? Well... what will you do? I will accept it as a human being. Because it will be human. Well, be off then. Go on and wait, you fool... since you're asking for it. Give him as much food and drink as he wants. It's better he's eating and drinking than if he were crying. He can eat only so much through this long night. Never again will he be able to eat and drink his fill. Don't you think that if one cannot handle death, one should at least not make a mockery of it. One can mock life, but in the face of death one should strive to greatness. Because that's the only moment of salvation and life. Stop wailing. I won't throw you out. You'll marry her. In return, you'll get an acre of land and a cow. I will do as you please, my lord but to my own disadvantage. What else do you want? A piece of meadow would be useful. One or two sheepskins. And shoes for the wedding. All that? She's a hangman's daughter, my lord. Very well. Go on already. My lord... your guests are waiting. Ah, yes, yes, I've nearly forgotten. Ah, dear sir, it's been almost a year since we last saw each other. I am glad you could come. I am of hunger, my dear count. Hunger is my soul. I've lived on my own saliva. On my own bile. On my parched liver. How's this year's harvest? Was the second crop worse than the first? Maybe so, maybe not. And are the sheep lambing? They are, they are. Prepare some potatoes. Don't spare bacon. Their smell should not just make me salivate, but bring tears to my eyes. Understand? Tears. Why should I eat potatoes? Make me noodles. But with eggs alone. As thin as gossamer. And yellow as the sun. What are you staring at? Don't you know that God gave man a wooden spoon? And all this was invented by men against men! Did you know, my dear ladies and sirs, I went last year to the springs. Off you go. Go... Whoever you are, my lord, let him, please, let him. Forgive me, my lady, your beauty has charmed me, but I am not a tree. I beg you, my lord, let him. Let's drink! Let's eat and laugh. But do we even know when we're truly joyful... and when convulse with hollow laughter? One is truly alive only when when one knows it. Perhaps someone can show us how one used to drink in the old days? One drunk by quarts! In one gulp! So... Who'll try the quart? I'll give a hound to whom saves our honor. I'll give a stallion. Anyone? I'll throw in a carriage. And a coachman. I'll give a 100 acres. So? A thousand acres. A forest. A meadow. No one? Maybe you, count? No? Anyone at all? Anyone? No one. Damn you. Then I will. Long live! Long live! I must tell you... Of late, I've enjoyed drinking. When I drink, everything seems reasonable, easy, nothing bothers me. I want nothing. Nothing surprises me. Perhaps, my friends, we musn't scorn those fleeting moments for who knows, it may be those moments that are eternal in man. Then, I feel like doing happy deeds... I make up my mind to give away all I own, and wander around the world with a beggar's walking stick. I'll stand outside a church, and hold out my hand... I'll give away all my land... all my choicest cattle, countless sheep, horses, dogs, canaries, I'll give it all away... All my servants, chambermaids, butlers... I'll give them all away. All my carriages, my coaches, my chambers, this whole palace... Have you gone mad, cousin? Don't worry, count. It's but idle dreams. Try at least to endure a dream with dignity! Welcome to my palace! Bind my arms and legs and you'll be more at ease. In such a moment, someone must be crucified for the moment to be eternal. So that you become worthy not of the moment but of eternity. Not very cheerful, are you, my lord? Take this! We will cheer you up! Your lordship... Who is this? I am so glad to see you, my lord. In such hour. When you, too, can be pitied. You had no idea I existed. Perhaps now, looking at my ugly, ailing body... you will discover that you had always wanted to pity someone, show them mercy... I wanted you, my lord... Once you were mine. You don't know it, but you were, for one night. Look. My body is bursting. He's big. Kicks. Runs. In the evening, I can feel him go to sleep. He can't fall asleep when I can't sleep. I can't stop thinking. He tosses and turns. He pushes at me. He stretches his arms and legs. Staring into darkness, he tickles me with his long eyelashes. He should have been born long ago already. But I'm afraid. Because if I part with him, I will be parting with you. Look. The prints of your palms are still visible. You gave me nothing in return. Not even a cow, or a lamb... Isn't it wonderful, your excellency? Why bother prolonging one's life if a moment can turn into a lifetime? Yes, this is inscrutable. Now you understand why after such a sublime song, loving anything else is impossible. And how can I experience the sublime if they're always outside my windows? Just take a look, my friend. Your lordship! Go away! Stop bothering me! Have pity on us, your lordship! Are children are starving, your lordship! All our possessions have gone up in flames. Have pity on us, your lordship! You see, your excellency... Can they understand anything? It's much quieter in my estates. Because you've got God on your side While I have to cope on my own. They're everywhere. They've besieged the palace with their laments. Day and night. I know I could have chased them away. But I can't. You're weary with life. Perhaps I've lived too long. Man is his own harshest sentence. There is no one to torment him as much as he does himself. You must accept God's will. God is your answer to everything. If I always relied on his will, I would not be myself. But you do believe in God? I don't. But I'm afraid of him. But I hope I'll handle him somehow. He's not inexorable. I'll build a roadside chapel, and we'll come to an agreement. My grandfather built a chapel, and now everyone knows he was pious. And if he had a soul, he had sold it to the devil. Believe me, if a chapel is not enough, I'll build a church. And if a church won't do it, I'll build a cathedral. And God will be enormous in it. He won't be nailed to a cross, but he'll be seated on a golden throne. And when the church bells ring... Can't you see, imbecile, that I have company? The bishop is here! On your knees and kiss his hand. Forgive him, your excellency. He's a goodnatured soul, but simpleminded. His father was one of my shepherds. Stop trembling. Speak. Who's come at this hour? The same one as yesterday. Ah, the rebel. If he were at least a thief, a good-for-nothing, a drunk... but, instead, he's a rebel. You won't find him in the tavern, or in the church. One must either drink or believe in God. What does he want? He's asking that your lordship only come up to the window. Do you think he did it out of despair? No! Out of hatred for me. The villain got tired of working. He assailed labor, not himself! What an intractable soul! But I feel sorry for him. And I forgive him. Fool. The old man is dead. You hear? He's lying outside the palace. He was cutting rosebushes, and then slit his own throat. You must take his body before his lordship gets up. I knew you'd come. That you wouldn't leave me in hardship. You alone can bring me relief, for everyone else is trying to trick me. Everyone's tormenting me. Don't cry. I've only asked you to dust the place, tidy up after the guests. Do you have any idea how much you suffer? Perhaps as much as I long for you. Perhaps our suffering is one, but we don't know it. Come closer. Come closer. I'm afraid of you. But I came to serve you because you're alone. All alone in this grand palace. You must be full of anguish, my lord. Full of hatred toward yourself. I don't know if I can help you. But I'll do whatever you want me to. You know what? I'll make a lady out of you. May even God know what it's like to lie in the secret of your breast. You know what? I'll give you a splendid funeral. I ask for your help, father. Everything has become insufferable in my solitude. Impossible to stifle in silence. You need a confession, my son. Confession will be of no use, father. The bishop himself had suggested it. I told him that I don't know why God demands humility since it's not my sins he wants to hear. He knows them well. He had condemned me to them. Indeed, you must be very unhappy. I am simply lonely and bored. Sometimes I envy people their misfortunes. I, too, would like to experience some great misfortune that I cannot even imagine. Perhaps through fate, perhaps of my own doing. You're blaspheming, my son. I, too, want to know what it's like to pity onself, to shed tears over oneself. Don't you think that man is never truer to himself than in suffering? Perhaps this longing after oneself, this cruel, selfish longing, is the essence of man? Anyway... I don't know... I don't know... I only doubt. Coachman! Coachman! Can't you hear this silence? Make it stop! I love you. And I love you. Will you be mine? Do you want to marry a shepherd? I do, Jacob, I do. How wonderful it is to be a shepherd. A shepherd's life... what more could one ask for? He leads his flock all his life. His dreams become reality at will. Or reality becomes dream. If something ails him, he takes refuge in his sheep, in the clouds, in birds... It's a beautiful fate. Beautiful, Jacob. One can't help but laugh at the thought that someone like that, stinking of sheep, of rank milk, of manure and sheepskin, that someone like that might have his own fate. That would be an offense against fate! That would be toying with fate. Fate! A mere farm hand is dreaming of fate? Is it not enough to fill his stomach? He'd like to have fate. He should rather pray, give thanks to God, but no, he wants fate! And this is becoming dangerous, ladies and gentlemen. There's a distant rumbling. Where are you off to, count? Going home? No! I'm tired, my dear host. Everyone's week in the knees, but we keep on dancing. All the doors are locked till the ball is over. No one can open them. Not even I have the right. Dance! This might be our last ball. Take the count to her ladyship. Let's dance till we're out of breath. Let's lose ourselves. Let's enjoy ourselves! Let's dance, round and round! Let's dance! Let's spin till we're out of breath. Let's hold our hands, and fall down together. And no one will ever rise again. Let's enjoy ourselves! Round and round. Oh, how much I desire to find myself alone with you, countess, far away from this ball. Far away from all of them For you... I came here only for you. I knew you needed me. Look, countess... The despair that must be filling these people since they succumb so easily to fatigue. Let's dance! Round and round, to make it before dawn. The livid morning sun will turn us into corpses. Then we'll face the fear that's gripping us. Oh God! Countess! This world cannot end when we do. It cannot begin with us anew! Let's dance! No! No! The whole world is on fire. The palace! My palace is burning! My palace! Sheep... My poor sheep! Why have I abandoned them? Why? My palace is burning! This is my legacy! This is all mine. It doesn't hurt. Nothing hurts any longer. Nothing any more. Subtitles: by ailverte for KG. October 2012.
