I told you, I, I need you. I told you, I'll be going for you. I told you, I, I, I need you. I told you, I'll be going for you. I told you, I, I, I need you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Can you please open your folders? OK. So as you can see, the model that we used in the first quarter has outperformed... the model that we used in the third quarter by 25%. With that being said, we can't continue to use... Ooh. Cori, are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm f... oh, no. Please... please give me a minute. Is she going to be OK? God, no. God, no. No, no. No. No. No. No. Hello? Happy birthday. Thanks, mom. What's wrong, baby? It's happening again. What do you mean? The dreams. Well, more like the nightmares about Cori. They're back. The same dreams? Yep. Her screams, it's like they just keep getting louder and louder. Aw, I'm so sorry, honey. Yeah. I just... I don't know. I thought that after two years, they would fade, you know? DAWN'S MOM: I understand, but there's no blueprint to grieving someone you loved. Hmm. I'm still not over your father's passing, and it's been 10 years. Cori was like a sister to you. And although you feel guilt, her death is not your fault. I just wish it felt like that. Well, I love you, and I hope you enjoy your morning. Everything's going to be OK. Happy birthday again, sweetie. Thanks, mom. Hey, baby. Happy birthday. Yay. Thank you, baby. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, my queen. You have no idea how much I needed this. I know. Happy birthday. I felt the knots in your shoulders the other day. So listen, I'ma take Lennox to day care. And I just need you to relax, get that massage, and step away from your feelings for a minute. It's your birthday. You deserve nothing but positive energy and maybe a little bit of living a little later. Oh, shut up. Come on, Lennox. Let's tell mommy bye bye. Mommy, bye bye. Come give me love. Aw, there's my baby. Mwa. Mommy loves you. Bye, bye. Let's go. Yay. Happy birthday, Mommy. Bye. Happy birthday. I love you so much. It's a special key that goes to my heart, a heart that holds laughs, cries, and secrets. We're sisters. We're best friends. We're connected to the end. That special day in the bathroom is where our journey begun. I mean, look, this is the perfect location. With the gym we opened up last year on the West Side, you see the numbers we're putting up with that. But it's about this foot traffic. We don't get half of this at the other gym. Some big money, huh? Private jet money. "Mistress on the private island" money. What kind of numbers they talking about? 500K cash. The bank going to give us the rest. And we'll own the whole building? The whole building. You're sure? We're going to put the gym, the spa, the cigar lounge, have it all popping at the same time. We got to move fast on this. Dude is not going to wait forever. When do you think you're going to be ready? I need a little more time. I'm going to be ready. The clock's ticking on this, Alex. Hit my line when you're ready. What is this? Really, Ma? A taser? You just never know when you'll need it. Thank you. You watch too much TV. Anyway, to my first and only born. Happy birthday. Thank you, Mommy. You're welcome. So I got you something. Here's your gift, and here's your birthday card. I know it's in the bag. I was rushing. I'm sorry. Oh, really? I love you. In the gas station bag? Don't judge me. Enjoy. Let me see what I got. Mom, I love it. Uh-huh. Now, all you need is a little bit in your bath, OK? OK. All right. I'm sorry I was late. A couple cousins came in at the last minute. Please, Mom, you don't have to explain. I just appreciate you helping me out with the store. Of course. It's your birthday. I really didn't expect you to come in today. How was your massage? So good. Yeah? I need, like, three of those a week. Is this seat taken? Aw. Mark, what a surprise. Well, she told me that you guys were going to be here. Right. So I felt I would Deebo the situation... No. And intrude. Well, you can intrude any time. You're are always welcome. So how's your birthday going? Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I should pay more attention. You got it, babe? Yeah. You good? Yeah. OK. Thank you. Sorry again. Um... All right, well. Well, the birthday is going good. OK. Alex and Lennox took me to the spa, so... - Oh, a spa. - That's so sweet. - That sounds really... - Yes. - Really amazing. - It does. Yes. It'd be nice if someone sends me to the spa. Hint, hint. Well, I think I'm going to take off. I'll probably just walk home so I can relax a little bit. Mm. Yes, baby. Relax. Clear your mind. Take a hot bath. Eat some ice cream, OK? And if you want, I'll come over and watch Lennox so you and Alex can have some alone time. You really are the best, Mom. You're my baby. OK. So I will call you later. OK. Mark, always a pleasure. Good seeing you. You don't look a day over 45. Oh, shut up. - Bye, baby. - Bye. Bye. That's my little baby. Look at her. - I know where she gets it from. - I do too. - Yeah? - Mm. So this... Girl took the wrong bag? He used to undress me with his eyes. Today was so crazy at work. I had meetings nonstop, and then the damn projector broke right in the middle of my presentation. And yet, all I could think about was cookie dough. Why are you looking at me like that? You're so beautiful to me. Please, all right? My hair is a mess. I've had this makeup on for, what, 10 hours? Can't help myself. You're perfect. It must be the dress. Look at what you're doing to me. Why nobody else... What's underneath is the prize, right? Addicted to you, can't you see? Caressing my body, body. You make me feel naughty, naughty. And before I know, I'm taking off my clothes. Oh, it's deja vu, the same every time that I want to fantasize. I can't help but have you on my mind. In the beginning, I felt loved every moment, but that part of our lives feels so long ago. He hasn't looked at me the same since I lost the baby. Hey, are you OK? Yeah, I'm good. Well, is there something you wanted to talk to me about? You seem distant. I mean, what you want to talk about? I don't know. Maybe how was my day or my meeting at social services. This whole adoption thing is something I don't want to do. Derrick, you act like we have a lot of choices. If it was my choice, my baby would have my DNA. You don't think I want the same thing? Every time I walk past that room, my heart hurts. For six months, I carried that baby. Six months! I know. Baby... I wanted to be buried with him. I'm trying so hard not to be depressed... Hey... but it's hard. Babe, I just... Uh, sorry, Miss Dawn! It's all right! Dawn? Dawn? Dawn! You OK? Yeah. Hey, baby. Hey. How was your day? It was good. I had lunch with Mom and Mark. Good. And how was the spa? Oh, it was so bomb. Thank you so much for that. Of course. Anything for you. Aw. How's my little pumpkin doing? He's good. He's inside waiting for Mommy to put him down for a nap. Of course, he's waiting for Mommy. Let me go get my baby. Hey, I wanted to talk to you about a couple things a little later when you get a minute. OK. What are you building? I make it. Oh, you're building your blocks? Look at that. So tall. Want to build, too? Yeah, I want to build. Like this? Hello, Dawn. I hope all is well with you and the baby. I know you haven't responded to any of my letters, but I really want to have a relationship with him as his grandmother. I know every letter says the same thing, but I'm innocent. I had nothing to do with Cori's death. My appeal will be heard soon, and the truth will set me free. I just ask... Cori? Where are you? I got your text. Cori? Cori. Cori! Cori! Cori, wake up! Cori! Oh, oh. You scared me. He's sound asleep. How was your day? Good. Really good, actually. My meeting went well. Well, that's good. Yeah. That's what I wanted to talk to you out. Check this out. You see that? That's a great investment. This allows me to have all three of my businesses in one building. Well, which businesses? Well, we were thinking the gym, the spa, and the cigar lounge. All three pretty risky though. No, no, no. See, this isn't risky because it's a great location. It's a high traffic area. So what's the investment? A couple 100,000, but definitely worth it. Trust me. Yeah, I don't know, babe. I 100% guarantee you'll get all the capital back. I mean, I really don't have a couple $100,000. And even if I did, I think we should put it toward Lennox's college fund. That's what Cori would want. Babe, Lennox is my son, too. And that's why I want to get this building, so I can contribute to his college fund as well. OK. Well, I mean, what's the big rush? Look, I think that we should just do some more research, and then we'll figure it out. This doesn't have to be done tomorrow. I'm not saying it has to be done tomorrow, but we both know what it means when you say let's figure it out. We've been talking about me starting my own business forever. I don't know why it's such a problem now. Really? Babe, I never said it was a big deal. I just said we'll handle it later. Well, I don't want to handle it later. I'm tired of waking up every morning and going to work for somebody else. And you being your own boss, I figured you of all people would understand that. Yeah, and I do. I do understand that. And I want you to be financially stable as well, but it's got to make sense. Look, when you and Cori asked me to be your surrogate, I didn't know she was going to die, and I damn sure didn't know that I was going to be raising a child, but here we are. I'm his mother now, and I have to be financially responsible for all of us. All of us. - Mr. Morant? - Yes. I'm Special Investigator Tony Morgan with the state. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Michelle Raymond. Sure. Come on in. Absolutely. Thank you. So what's all this about? Well, her appeal hearing is coming up soon, and I wanted to go over your testimony just to refresh our knowledge of the case. OK. Good morning, ma'am. How are you? I'm fine. So Mr. Morant, you said in your testimony that you found Michelle Raymond standing next to Cori's body. Can you pick it up from that particular situation for me? Sure. Cori wasn't feeling too well that day. I remember she texted me, asking me if I could hurry home. I left work, drove straight home. When I walked into the house, I searched all over for her. I couldn't find which room she was in. I walked into our bedroom, and that's when I saw Michelle standing there. She was just hovering over Cori with this look in her eyes, this sinister look of pure evil. And that's when I knew. So I started trying to resuscitate her. And I just happened to look up. And I see Michelle trying to hide these pills. So she was trying to hide the pills, actually? Yes, sir. Then when I confronted her about the pills, that's when she attacked me. And I'll be honest with you, I wanted to retaliate because I just couldn't figure out how she could do this to her own daughter. Listen, I know this is tough, but trust and believe we're going to resolve this situation. Thank you for your time. Detective? Yes? I don't know how much weight this carries, but Michelle does not deserve to be a free woman. She worked at the pharmacy, which means she had access to those pills, the same pills that the police found at her house. So in my opinion, this is an open and shut case. Well, if the facts are as you stated, it sounds like it is. Thank you for your time. I won't bother you guys no more. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Managing my mother and my relationship is wearing me down. Thanks, mom. Mm-hmm. I just hate seeing you this way. I know. I'm OK. I'm going to go back to work soon. Mm, no, no, no, no. I think you should really think about that. Don't rush back to work. You need time to heal, emotionally. Yeah, well, the bills have to get paid. What about Derrick? Isn't he working? The gym is just a little slow right now. That gym tends to be slow all the time. Don't you think? Ma... A man is supposed to take care of his woman, not the other way around. He's trying. I just don't... Ma, please, OK? I'm just not in the mood for one of your life/boyfriend lessons right now, all right? I get it. You don't like Derrick. All right. He's not as ambitious as you want him to be. He doesn't make enough money. Blah, blah, blah. I get it. Hey, look. You know I love you. I know. I just want what's best for my daughter, and you've worked so hard to get where you are. I just don't know if he... If he what? It's funny, right, Lisa? The people that fail in relationships always have the most advice. Derrick, stop. It's true. Right, Angela? What are you trying to say? I'm saying it's obvious your husband left you. Remember? Yet you're here trying to give your daughter advice on what type of man she needs. I know she needs someone better than you, someone with a better job. Job? Hmm. You work at a pharmacy as a cashier. Stop. All right, can you just stop? This is every time now. This shit is draining, listening to you argue all the time! And you wonder why I'm depressed! This is why! Hmm. Stop worrying about my household. I got this. Let me tell you something. As long as my daughter's here paying all the bills, I'm going to worry. I'm so tired of you letting your mother disrespect me! You OK? Yeah. Yeah. Why did you sleep out here? Well, I just couldn't sleep, and I came down here to read. I... I... I must have just fell asleep down here. Yeah, OK. What time is it? It's time for Lennox to go to daycare. Oh, shit. No worries. I already got him ready. OK, babe. I'm sorry. I... I'm sure I can change and... Yeah. No, it's... - and take him. - It's fine. It's already done. You're positive? I'm positive. It's OK. I'll just see you later, OK? Try to get yourself together. Thank you. I found these on the floor. Wow. Um, I'm sorry. Babe, I... I don't even know how they got there. Hello? Mom? Hey. What's going on? I'm not feeling too well. Really? What's wrong? I don't know. I just... I feel groggy and weak. Aw. Do you need anything? No, Ma. I should be fine. Do you mind covering for me today? Yeah, no problem. Are you sure you're OK? Yeah. I think I'm just going to relax for a bit. DAWN'S MOM: OK, honey. Have some tea, and burn some of those oils I gave you. Oh, that's what I meant to tell you. You remember the woman at the restaurant that bumped my chair? Yeah. Well, she took the wrong bag, so she's probably enjoying those oils that you bought me. Really? That sucks. Well, I actually have her book. And it's good, but weird at the same time. Hmm. Sounds interesting, I think. Yeah. I don't know. It's just something about it. It's, um... I don't know. Something familiar about it. But, um, I don't know. I'll call you back later, Ma. OK. Feel better, honey. OK, I will. I love you. OK. Bye, bye. All right. Let's make you beautiful. Put the offer together. It's a solid one. I don't have the check yet. What do you mean you don't got the check yet? She got the money, but we're just trying to figure it out. You'll figure it out. To be all the way honest, I ain't even trying to hear all that shit. If she's got the money, then why you ain't got the check? Yo, just calm down, man. Look, I ain't calming shit down. You must not understand what's going on here, so let me refresh your memory. I know everything, Alex. This is not a partnership. You owe me. Yeah, I know. Just... I'ma figure it out. Well, you got a couple days. And after that, I got to do what I got to do. If I got to expose you, believe me, I will. This is one of the things that I struggle with on a daily. Some days, I think it was the right thing to do because Lennox is so happy, and I know no one would take care of him the way I can. Other days, my sister, I feel like I betrayed you because I know that this is the life that you always wanted. Cori, I love you. And I... I need you to know that I never wanted to take your place. I never wanted to be with your man. When you died, a piece of me died. And being Lennox's adoptive mother is the only piece of you that I have left. It's the only thing that gives me life. If it wasn't for my best friend, I don't know where I would be. Surprise. Oh, my goodness. I can not believe you're here. Aw. I... I finally came. I'm sorry. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Wait. My room is a mess. Oh, my goodness. Let me just... I can help you. I mean, it looks like you need it. You know I would sleep with you in a dumpster if I had to. Yeah. Well, this is pretty close. Um... hey. So how's my sis? Girl, I don't even recognize myself anymore, OK? Look at me. With everything you've been through? Your energy and your soul is glowing. Enough about me. What's going on with you? Um, nothing much. Well, today, I was at the lawyer's office, going over the details of my trust fund. I thought you did that already. I did, but my dad structured it so that money would be released over time. And then every time money is released, I have to go sign for it. Yeah, blah, blah, blah. That's boring. I want juicy. Come on. Tell me what's going on with Larry. I mean, nothing much. I need to hear. You know I love Larry. You're going to be disappointed. Why? Because there's no more Larry. What? No. I'm sorry, but I know you liked him. Yeah. I just couldn't do it anymore. Yeah, his name is Steven. I think you'll like him more than Larry. More? Well... I'll try. We just can't do all for the bullshit, you know? Girl, don't I know. Is everything OK? It's not the same. And honestly, I'm not the same. I'm sorry I haven't been here every single day. I would not forgive myself if you were here every single day, OK? You have a life and a business. I understand. I know, but I should have been here more than I have. You're here now. That I am. I have good news though. What? I met someone else. That was fast. Oh, my... you scared me. What are you doing sitting in the dark? Thinking. You're thinking in the dark? OK. How you doing? I'm all right. I'm just tired. I don't know what's going on with my body. I just feel weak. You need to eat. I can make you something. All right. Thank you. I'm just going to go to the bathroom. Being blinded by love blocked me from seeing what was happening right in front of my eyes. Thanks, babe. Oh, this is good. You want a bite? Nah. I'm good. I'm not hungry. You OK? When did you decide to get a policy? I mean, when I lost the baby, and I heard the doctor say I could have died, I got a life insurance policy. You should get one, too. I will. I might have you as the beneficiary, unlike yours. It's not even like that. Then how is it? We both know your mother would love a couple 100,000 if something happened to you and Kelly. Her family's got money. She don't even need it. And then there's me. I'm left out in the cold. But anyway, I had a couple of thoughts about this whole adopting a baby thing. OK. Have you thought of a surrogate? Nah, it's too expensive. Yeah. But what if it wasn't expensive? Like what if I can get it for free? How, Derrick? Kelly. What? Think about it. She's like a sister. You know she'll do anything for you. You put her as a second beneficiary on your life insurance policy. That says a lot. She's the perfect candidate. No. I would feel crazy asking her to do something like that. Uhn-uhn. I... You think she likes seeing you like this? Do you think she enjoys knowing you're depressed? This is the best thing for you and us. The least you can do is try! OK. OK. Right? OK. All right, OK. Let me just... Uh, Lisa? Oh, my god. Hey. Girl, I almost hit you. Oh, I'm sorry for popping up on you like this. No, it's OK. I was just going to go run some errands. Are you OK? Yeah. Um, can we just take a walk for a minute? Sure, sure. You look cute. Thank you. You look good, too. You know I know when you're lying, right? So what's going on? Talk to me. I don't know. It's like, I don't know what's going on with Derrick. One minute, he's trying to get me to join this pyramid scheme, and then the next he's having these crazy thoughts about adopting. Really? But then last night, we talked about a surrogate. Hmm. I mean, a surrogate is a good option. Yeah, but he mentioned you. Me? I know. I looked exactly how you do right now, right? I'm like, that's crazy, right? But... Mm. I don't know. It's like, the more I sat and thought about it, the less crazy it kind of sounded. I mean, look, you've been my sister since day one. I have always considered you as that, right? And I don't know. When I think about somebody to share such a precious, life-changing moment with, you're the only person that I could think of. You know, when the doctor said that they had to decide between saving me or my baby... I was ready to die. Knowing that I can't have children, it just, like... It just, like, killed my soul. And I know... I know that I cannot fathom, you know, what I'm asking you. Like, I get it, 'cause it's a lot. Sis, sis, sis. Stop. Stop. I'll do it. I'll do it. I can't even imagine the type of pain you have endured. You are so strong. You know that? And I know if the roles were reversed, and I was sitting on this bench asking you to do the same thing, you would do it for me. Of course. I know. I know. It's going to be OK. I love you. It's going to be OK. Best friend, you're the light to my darkness, the strength to my weakness, the peanut butter to my jelly. Ay. I'm rolling my ace today. Ay, y'all. What's up? We're two peas in a pod. That's right. And I'm the peanut butter. And I'm the jelly. And you can't have one without the other. Oh, shit. You scared the hell out of me. What are you doing? I'm wondering why you haven't picked up our son like you agree to. Shit. I'm sorry. I forgot. Yeah. I see why. I'll go get him. I'll come with you. It's fine. Can I have my book? Maybe you should give this book a break. You're becoming obsessed. What? I'm fine. And you don't have to take it away from me like a toy from a child. Can you stop, please? Will you look at yourself? You're acting like this over a little book. You haven't worked. You haven't cooked. You ain't even cleaned up the damn place. Excuse you. Give me my book. I don't know what's going on with you, Dawn, but this little obsession that you have with this book? It ain't healthy. You got my money? Almost. So why are you on my phone? I need more pills. These games you playing, I don't got time for them. I'm not playing any games, all right? You said you want the money, right? Yeah. Well, I need more pills, like ASAP. Meet me at the spot, and hurry up. Yeah. Hello? Ma? Hey. How are you feeling? I'm losing my shit. What? What's wrong with you? You remember that book that I've been reading? Mm, the weird and good one? Yeah. It's... I don't know. It's weird. It... It's like it's... it's connected to me somehow. What? I'm serious, Ma. It's like everything that I'm reading in the book is happening in my real life. Dawn, baby, have you been getting enough rest? Yes. All I do is sleep. And no, I'm not overreacting, so don't say that. OK, OK. Calm down. Well, I don't know. Maybe you need to get out of the house for a while. Come here. The customers have been asking about you anyway. Yeah. Um, I don't kn... Mom, let me call you back. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Hello. You have reached Books and Books. We are currently closed. Please leave a message. Hey. Hey. You busy? Uh, just returning some emails. All right. Um, I owe you an apology. I was being an asshole earlier because I... I really miss you. I feel like you've been a little distant lately, but that's no excuse. I'm sorry. Aw. Yeah. I've, um... I don't know. I just... I've just been trying to figure everything out. And I'm sorry, too. It's all good. I brought us back a nice bottle of wine, and I dropped Lennox off at your mother's house because I figured we needed some adult time. OK. Yeah? Yeah. All right. He is so precious. He is. He is just like Cori. Her twin, literally. I can't believe he's two. Time just flies by. Babe, listen. I know at times you might question all of this or beat yourself up over us being married, and I get it. I promise, I understand. But I also know how much Cori loved you and me. And deep in my heart, I believe she would have been OK with this, especially for the sake of Lennox. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be here with you. But Dawn, I need you to start believing it, too, because it's the truth. Shit. What's wrong? It's my mom. She texted me. I forgot about this client picking up this painting. She can't handle that? Um, it's one of my father's old friends. He likes to sit and talk, and he spends a lot of money with us. So usually, I just sit and listen. You don't mind if I... No, it's fine. I'll just see you later. Um, given some more thought about your investment property. Maybe, um, we can work something out. OK. I see you judging me, and I'm not surprised. Remind me of your damn mama. Cori? Where are you? I got your text. Cori? Cori? Cori! Cori! She's dead. She's dead! What did you do? What are you talking about? What did you do to my daughter? What'd you do to her? 911. What is your emergency? Send help. My girlfriend is laying here, and she's not breathing. I'm at 553 Copperas Cove Lane. Please, help me! Please! Now, everybody's going to know about those pills you were giving her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Daddy, what you doing? Come here. Uh, uh, uh. Hey. Best friend, when you agreed to have the baby, the smoke started to fade, and the agenda was becoming more clear. Hi. Need any help? No, I'm OK. OK, cool. What kind is that? This is Gorgonzola. Interesting taste. Does that mean you don't like it? Listen, I just want to say thank you. You have a beautiful soul. You don't know how much this means to me. I can't wait till the day I can repay you. Wow. Well, you're welcome. You know I would do anything for her. I know. May I? Sure. The red flags were there. I just didn't want to believe it. Betrayal is worst when it comes from someone you love. Babe, want some tea? Sure. Baby, you OK? - I'll be OK. - Uh-uh. Something's wrong. I want to get you in with the doctor tomorrow, OK? Yeah. I'll go. All right. I have a client I have to train. I won't be gone long. Uh, so I have a question because it wasn't stated here in your paperwork. Are you taking any medication for pain or injury? No, I'm not taking anything. OK. Listen, I don't want you to feel a certain kind of way because I have to ask this, but are you using any drugs you haven't told me about? No, I'm not taking any drugs, Dr. Ryan. I'm confused. Well, your labs came back positive. Positive? You tested positive for oxycodone. What? Wait, what? There must be a mistake. We ran your urine twice, and your blood came back with the same results. Listen, here. Th... Th... That's not necessary. No. OK, I understand. I understand. But I have to give this to you, OK? This is the first step in getting past your denial. I should be able to trust you, and you should be honest with me. Does Derrick know? Mom, please, I'm not on drugs, OK? I don't know what's going on, and I know that it seems crazy, but you have to trust me. - But how? - I don't know. I mean, really? OK, look. I just need space right now, all right? I need space. I... I can't. This is... this is cra... I'm fine, all right? I'm fine. Oh, man. It's open. Hey. Hey. I was coming by to check on Dawn. Dawn said she was coming to the store to help a customer. Oh. Um, I thought that she might have been back by now. Maybe she's still there. Yeah, maybe. You know, she's been a little off lately. Hmm. She's increasingly become obsessed with this book she's been reading. Has she mentioned it to you? She has. It's silly. I don't think it's a big deal. It's really silly. Yeah, I hope not. You know, this is crazy, man. It's like, she and Cori are a lot alike in so many different ways. Cori would get to these points where she would become so... So distant at times, you know, and just really secretive about every little thing. That's when I found out she was addicted to those pills her mom was giving her. You know, I think that she's just going through a tough time right now. She'll snap out of it soon. Oh, I'm sure she will. Hmm. Well, I didn't mean to intrude. I'll give her a shout later, OK? OK. I never thought my life would have this sharp of a turn. Hello? Dawn, where are you? Shit. I lost track of time. Uh, yeah, you did. And you didn't inform me of the little lie. Wait. You went to my house? Yes. Why? What? I went to check on you. What did you say? I didn't say anything. He mentioned you went to the store, and I said you were probably still there. OK, good. I don't like this, Dawn. What's going on with you? Mom, I have so much to talk to you about, but I really can't even talk to you right now. Is it about that damn book? Yes, it is, but, Ma, I really think it's real. Dawn... No. I... I know that it sounds crazy, but you have to trust me on this, OK? OK. All right. I'll... I'll call you back later. OK. How was your meeting? It was good. It... It went on a little longer than expected. He ended up taking me to meet another buyer. I... I should have called. I'm... I'm sorry. I left my phone in the car. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's OK. I love you. The time has come for my appeal to be heard. And I can't lie, the butterflies are multiplying in my stomach. I can't wait until the truth is revealed, and I can be a free woman again. As I've said in all the letters I've written to you, I love Cori. I would have never done anything to hurt my one and only child. I think in your heart you know that. He is very dangerous. Oh. Here he is. There's my boy. Daddy. All right. It's time for school. No, no, no. I think we're going to skip school today. He can stay home with me. Why? Because I miss him, and I want to spend some time with my son and my wife. Uh, I... I just have a few errands that I need to run, so... Really? Yeah. What kind of errands? A doctor's appointment. For? Female stuff. Just a checkup. Yeah, a doctor's appointment for a checkup. OK. OK. All right, baby. Mommy loves you. See you later. Hey? We'll be here waiting for you. Women's Detention Center. - Officer Jolly speaking. - Hi. Yeah. Um, I wanted to know how I could visit an inmate there. What's the inmate's name? Michelle Raymond. And what is your name? I'm Dawn Goldie. Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am. You're not on the visiting list. So she has to put you on the list, and it has to be approved. OK. H... How long does that usually take? Uh, that... that can take weeks. Look, sir, um, if there's any way that you could just make something happen for me, it's... it's... it's an emergency. OFFICER JOLLY: Yeah, I'm sorry. This is protocol, ma'am. I hope I get time for that. You feel me? Oh, my god. Do you remember that? It was just like that. That was hilarious. Surprise. Well, hello to you, too. I didn't know we were having company. Yeah. I invited them over. You know, it's been a while since we all sat down together. Figured why not, right? And look, we brought your favorite bottle of wine. We did. Great. Uh, I'll go freshen up. Yes? It's me, honey. Are you OK? Yeah. I just didn't know we were having a family dinner. I mean, I would like to know those kinds of things. Is it a big deal? Stop being a grouch, and come eat with your family. Alex prepared this nice dinner and has cooked for everyone. Be grateful that you have a good husband. I made your favorite. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - Come on in. Thank you very much. Good. Is... Is Alex here? - And what's your name? - Jamie. Jamie. Nice to meet you. - It's a pleasure. OK. Alex! Let me get this. Oh, excuse me. - Beautiful home. - Thank you so much. Yeah, of course. What are you doing here? I tried calling you, but you didn't answer. It's kind of funny you just went MIA, so I figured I'd come by and see what's going on with you. All right. Well, can we talk about this later? Alex, is your friend staying for dinner? - Oh... - No. I definitely wouldn't want to intrude, but I'm very hungry, so thank you very much. Come on in. Plus, it smells amazing. It's been a while since I've had a home-cooked meal. Mm. I must say, it's very good. So Dawn, I hear you're a painter. Yeah. Dawn's father was a famous painter. That's where she gets her talent from. Oh, you should come check out the gallery. Oh, amazing. I would love to. I'm very fascinated by art. So what do you do? I'm an investment broker. I started a gym on the West Side Alex works at. Oh, OK. So is that how you guys met? Oh, no. We went to college together. Oh, the good old days. College was some of the best times of my life. Tell me about it. I think it's those drugs. I don't remember my freshman year, my sophomore years. Oh, spare me the details. Trust me, it was wild. It's funny you say that. Me and Alex were the same exact way, always laughing and joking about our drinking alter egos. I was Justin, and what was it? Derrick. Yeah, that's right. You were Derrick. What did you say? His drinking alter ego name. It was Derrick. Yeah. Please excuse me. Is everything all right with your lady? Yeah. She, uh... she ain't been feeling too good lately. Oh. That's too bad. Honey, are you OK in there? Uh, yeah. Um, just give me a few minutes. OK. Just call me later. We're getting ready to head out. OK. Well, I hate to eat and run, but I got a very important meeting I got to head to. Thank you so much for having me. Oh, no problem. Don't make these little drop-bys a habit. That's a nice little family you got in there. Listen, I'ma be ready real soon, aight? It's not soon enough. You better hurry up and do whatever it takes. Or? They're all going to be really interested in who Derrick really is. I told you, I'ma handle it. Yeah, you better. Book. Holy shit. Holy shit. Jackpot. Detective Russo? That part of our lives feels so long ago. Managing my mother and my relationship is wearing me down. If it wasn't for my best friend, I don't know where I would be. Betrayal is worst when it comes from someone you love. I never thought my life would have this sharp of a turn. Hey. Hey. Thank you for coming to watch Lennox. Yeah. Have you heard from her? Nah. Oh. I called her a few times, but she ain't answer. What? All right, so he's upstairs playing. I already fed him and bathed him, so he should be good. OK. If you hear from her, can you text me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem. All right. I shouldn't be too long. - Mm. - Thank you again. Yeah. Dawn, where are you? Just driving. Why? What's up? Honey, you know how much I love and respect you, right? OK? I need you to tell me the truth. Tell you the truth? The truth about what, Mom? DAWN'S MOM: Your drug use. My what? Dawn, let's do this together. Ma, what are you talking about? Who told you this? With the way you've been acting lately, we're both really worried. We? Dawn, Alex found your pills. - I - know you're wondering why I never came to you. I'm too embarrassed to say but... But I will. The truth is I was jealous that he wanted you and not me... The twinkle in his eyes when he looked at you, how joyful he looked when he rubbed your stomach. I even made myself believe that you enjoyed it, too. I was so focused on what my mind created that I didn't even pay attention to what actually was happening. And now it's too late. So as I write this to you, I want you to know I apologize. I apologize for being jealous, I apologize for being insecure, and I apologize for not being the sister that you expected me to be. So if these are the last words to you, just know you will be proud of me. I won't go without a fight. We're sisters. We're best friends. We're connected to the end. That special day in the bathroom is where our journey began. Hi. Are you OK? No. I think I just got my period. Me too. Do you have a pad? No. Here. Thank you. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. I'm Dawn. I'm Cori. Hi. May I help you with something? Um, is the owner of the store here? You're looking at her. Oh, OK. Um, I have a question about a book. Sure. Which one? I think it was published here or maybe sold here. Yes. We are a local publishing company. We try to publish the books of local writers to help them build a fan base through our bookstore. She did such an amazing job with this one that we decided to publish it for her. Have you read it? Yeah, but the author isn't Caitlin Charles though. So you're the best friend? Yeah, I am. I've been waiting for you for some time now. She described you perfectly. Cori? Yes. So here I have something for you. OK. Here is the original manuscript written by Cori Raymond. She only wanted you to have it. It's a tragedy what happened to her. But before she passed, she mentioned there might be more to the story, but only you would know where to find it. Do you have any idea what she meant? We're sisters. We're best friends. We're connected to the end. If you're watching this video, I'm probably dead. The phone you have is connected to this camera, and you will see everything he's done to me. He's been tracking my every move, but he didn't get this. So if I end up missing, I know you know what to do with this, Dawn. I love you so much. Yeah, I'm here. Come to the house. What are you doing? Get out! Whoa. Just tell me what's wrong with you. What's wrong with me? Maybe it's the drugs you've been giving me. What are you talking about? Hey, easy. Get out. OK, relax. OK? Just put the knife down. You really thought you was going to get away with this, huh? You think you so smart, but you not. OK. Listen, all right? I don't know what you think you saw, but I promise you, that's not what's going on. I got everything. I got it all. You're going to prison! Cori, baby, OK, just listen to yourself for a minute. Uh-uh. All right? It's me. You know how much I love you. OK, easy. Get out. I will kill you. Get out. All right. Grab my bags. Get out. You never was good enough for me. My mom told me not to trust you! I hate you! Get your broke ass out! Come on. Come on. Come on. It's all right. No worries. Come on, I got you. Come on. Come on, let's go. Oh. Who's there? Alex? Baby, please. Baby, what are you doing? Please, don't. Please... what are you doing? No! No! No! No! No. Oh! No! Stop moving. You're a wiggly little thing. We could have had our perfect little family, the house, a few businesses. But, of course, you just couldn't let it go, now could you? That is so Dawn of you. I thought I had it all figured out, but what I didn't factor in was the fact that, uh, you never loved me, and you couldn't even fake it. Huh? I mean, that's the least you could have done. Oh, how could I forget this? This is a letter confessing your obsession that you had with me, and that obsession led to your addiction. Yeah. I mean, logically, that's the only way you could explain stealing Cori's husband and her baby, which ultimately led to you killing yourself. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What? What's that? Oh, you... you want to say something? What'd you say? You're sick. You're right. I am sick! Sick of tired ass women like you, Cori, and Michelle always running your mouth. You didn't have to kill her. You could have just left. I could have just left? And passed up on all of this, including the $2 million of trust fund money you got for my baby? No, I couldn't just leave. So all of this... All of this is about m... Money? Yes. All of this is all about money. I could have just gave you the money. Oh, now you could have just given me the money? It's too late for all that. Babe, don't cry. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Look at me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I got some good news for you. Lennox and I will be well taken care of, thanks to you. We appreciate that. Don't you fucking move. Will you give it a rest? Now, where were we? Oh, that's right, about the whole money situation. It's OK, baby. Mommy's here. It's OK. Baby, mommy's here. It's OK. Mom... Mommy's here. Mommy's here, baby. It's OK. It's OK. This is like deja vu. No, you're going to die tonight. Hold it. On many nights, I pray for this day to come not for my freedom. I knew that was inevitable. But I prayed that monster, Alex, got what he deserved. It hurts my heart that my daughter suffered the way she did. All I can do now is be the best grandmother I can be. Grandma Chelly. Grandma Chelly. Oh, hey, baby. Hey, bubba. Beautiful as ever. Thank you. We're best friends. We're sisters. We're connected to the end. And that first time in the bathroom... is where our journey began. Dear best friend. Yeah. Tell your friend that she fine. Tell her where I'm at. Tell her, hit me on my line. If you with her now, tell her that I'm outside. Bring it to your door like it's Amazon Prime. Dear best friend, tell your friend I want to talk. Yeah. Take it to the park 'cause I love it when she walk. Take her to the store. She gonna tell you what she bought. Yeah. Player certified, they should give me an award. Dear best friend, tell your friend I'm more than average. Take her on a date in a carriage. Girl, don't let that horse eat your carrots. Take you to the shows and the pageants. Take you by the hand, have you feeling different fabrics. Hold up. They waiting at the party. I don't show up. One look at the Gram, know a nigga finna blow up. Go and get your friend. We can have a little pow wow. Shorty feeling on me, man. I think she need some more. Best friend. And I see you got a friend. Yeah. And I see that you got a friend that got a thing for me. Uh-huh. And they can't stop looking my way, so I really got to say, I know you're my best friend. Best friend. And I see you got a friend. Yeah. And I see that you got a friend that got a thing for me. And they can't stop looking my way, so I really got to say, I know you're my best... You're my bestie. I ain't even...
