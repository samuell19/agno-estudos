Aviv. -Right. ﻿I told him he'll be meeting the IDF's finest soldiers ﻿so nobody give him a hard time. ﻿So... ﻿as I said, ﻿you're gonna navigate ﻿in new territory. ﻿The IDF hasn't navigated here for at least 40 years. ﻿It'll be our training zone from now on ﻿so make yourselves at home. ﻿Safety rules: ﻿Rifles unloaded and on "safety," ﻿nobody loads for any reason. ﻿Remember to fill your canteens before you go. ﻿Don't drink any water you find out there. ﻿Everyone back here in five hours. ﻿Questions? ﻿Good. ﻿Tomer has a short briefing for us. ﻿Make it quick. ﻿Hello, Yoke? ﻿What about the food? ﻿We're south of Firing Range 9341 ﻿in the southern Negev hills, desert terrain. ﻿150 mm of precipitation per year. ﻿I prepared a map... ﻿Shut up, quiet now. ﻿Shut up. -What's your problem? -Show some respect. ﻿Are you done? ﻿As you can see, the boundaries are marked. Not far from here is Jabl Kaniyer, a former Bedouin settlement, ﻿nothing there now. ﻿In the Independence War the IDF went in ﻿and evacuated all the Bedouins. ﻿They did a lousy job, ﻿must've been the Golani Brigade. ﻿Are you with me? ﻿Excuse me, ma'am, this is a military zone. ﻿Ma'am, this is a military zone. Please stay out. ﻿Don't you hear me? ﻿My boy! My boy! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿My boy, where is he? ﻿Where is he? -Put down your gun, stupid! ﻿Ma'am, get up and leave. ﻿Go, please... -My son, ﻿where's my son? ﻿I've been looking for him all day! ﻿All day! ﻿Does anyone understand what the old lady's saying? ﻿Two hummus, fries and salad, right? ﻿I think she's looking for her son. ﻿You think, Hochman? ﻿Tell her: He went with one of his sheep. ﻿Shut your mouth, Mosquito. ﻿God will avenge you. God will avenge. ﻿The land will devour you, devour you all. ﻿Welcome to Bab Jahannam. ﻿Welcome, welcome to Bab Jahannam. ﻿Please, please, come in. ﻿Every dog has his day. ﻿Every dog has his day. -Simhoni! ﻿Every dog has his day. -Turn off the camera. ﻿Turn off the camera! ﻿Simhoni, Hochman, get her outta here. ﻿Let's go, Granny. -Bab Jahannam! ﻿Get her outta here! ﻿Get her outta here! ﻿It's all right. ﻿As we said, this is also the outer boundary ﻿so if you get lost, ﻿walk along the road ﻿back to here. ﻿But that won't happen, right? ﻿Rig -Yes ﻿Good. We leave in five. Move it. ﻿IDF Spokesman, ﻿you'll be with Tomer, he's the best navigator here ﻿and he can answer your questions. ﻿Mosquito! ﻿This is Mosquito, he'll... ﻿make sure you don't get bored. ﻿You think I can't navigate? ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿Be back in time to put Seacrest here to sleep. ﻿Seacrest, where's your work uniform? ﻿I don't have one. ﻿You don't have one? ﻿The Spokesman Unit must be like summer camp. ﻿Shushan, put the radio on me. ﻿Are there any girls there. You get laid a lot? ﻿How do you get to join the unit? ﻿Connections? ﻿What's your profile? ﻿64 (non-combat). ﻿I have severe asthma, ﻿chronic bronchitis. ﻿Bronchitis? ﻿Sounds like a hemorrhoid cream. ﻿Sure you can navigate with your asthma? ﻿It's only five hours, right? ﻿Cyclamen 5 to CO Cyclamen, do you copy? ﻿Loud and clear, Cyclamen 5. Permission to leave. ﻿Okay, let's go. ﻿Okay, I'll pick it up. ﻿I don't care where or when ﻿I call you Barbie and you call me Ken... ﻿Hochman, cut the chatter. ﻿What are you filming, Bronchitis? ﻿Everything, then I use the most interesting stuff. ﻿Aviv, film me. ﻿Listen, ﻿show this to the chicks at National HQ, ﻿tell them I'm sensitive and spontaneous ﻿and good hearted. ﻿Love ya, baby. ﻿Time to drink. ﻿Didn't you bring water? ﻿No, I... ﻿What's with you, Bronchitis? ﻿Here. ﻿Amazing view. ﻿Join Givati and you'll get this every day. C'mon. ﻿You got it wrong. ﻿I'll show you how to whistle. ﻿Not like that, doofus. ﻿There should be a cave around here. ﻿With coordinates at the entrance. ﻿Whoa! ﻿Look at the cave I found, looks like your mama's pussy! ﻿Mosquito! ﻿What a kickass navigator! ﻿Check it out, dude. ﻿Must be the coordinates of some unit that navigated here. ﻿It's humungous. ﻿Mosquito, you know the rules. Caves are off limits. ﻿What's a coordinate? ﻿Talk to the camera. ﻿Mosquito! ﻿What a nutcase. ﻿Mosquito! ﻿Mosquito? ﻿Mosquito? ﻿Mosquito? ﻿Bab Jahannam! Slaughter the Jews! ﻿What's wrong with you?! ﻿Very funny, Mosquito. ﻿Can we keep going or do you have some more jokes? ﻿You gotta see this. ﻿What now? ﻿It doesn't.. ﻿look like coordinate markings. ﻿Yikes... ﻿"Yikes..." ﻿You scared of bats, Bronchitis? ﻿Ya think? ﻿Then come on. ﻿Come on. ﻿No problem. -Come on. ﻿Mosquito, you know the rules, ﻿let's get out and keep going. ﻿How will you ever be an officer if you're such a chicken? ﻿What the hell is this? ﻿Film me, Bronchitis. ﻿This is Yuval Arieli, reporting on Bedouins ﻿and their dear ones, may they rest in peace. ﻿We're here in a cave, ﻿where Abu-Mosquito married Oum Kalthoum the sheep, ﻿slaughtered her on their wedding night ﻿and made her into kebab. -Hold on, ﻿I have a problem here. ﻿Piece of shit camera. ﻿What's the matter, Bronchitis? ﻿Camera doesn't work in field conditions? ﻿It's used to filming you having sex at HQ, huh? ﻿Let's get outta here. ﻿Should we call Field HQ? ﻿Cyclamen 5 to CO Cyclamen, do you copy? ﻿Cyclamen 5 to CO Cyclamen, do you copy? ﻿No signal. ﻿We'll try again from somewhere higher. ﻿Why don't we... ﻿try again? ﻿Relax, Bronchitis, we're just too low. ﻿Happens all the time. ﻿Tell me, ﻿what else do you know about this place? ﻿Anything besides what you said in the briefing? ﻿Like what? ﻿Maybe some interesting battle heritage? ﻿Why navigate here, of all places? ﻿You said something about a battle with the Bedouins. ﻿It wasn't a battle, the IDF came, the Bedouins fled, ﻿then they said their children were killed, ﻿their wells were poisoned, all that crap. ﻿I see. ﻿There was a training accident in the 70s, two men were killed, ﻿haven't been any maneuvers here since. ﻿How did they die? ﻿Their car flipped over. ﻿Didn't that Bedouin lady say this place is evil or something? ﻿I'm fuckin' sick of these maneuvers. ﻿My legs are killing me. ﻿Chill, it's just a few hours. ﻿Don't be a smartass, Bronchitis. ﻿Don't get pissed off. -I'm not. ﻿Fine. ﻿Are you messing wit me. -Just chill. ﻿I hear something. ﻿What did you hear? -Shut up. ﻿Does your camera have night vision? ﻿Tell me if you see anything. ﻿Is it working? -Yeah. ﻿Did you load your gun? ﻿Why'd you load your gun? ﻿Don't film me, look around. ﻿I don't see a thing. ﻿Should I load mine, too? Tomer! ﻿Fuck... ﻿It's only a dog. ﻿Don't film that. It's alive. ﻿Let's keep moving. ﻿We can't just leave him here. ﻿What do you want me to do? ﻿I don't know, call a vet. ﻿A vet? ﻿Where do you think you are? Tel Aviv? ﻿Let's move it. Mosquito! ﻿Tomer, wait, let's think of something. ﻿Maybe turn the radio on... ﻿What did you do? ﻿He was half-dead anyway. Why make him suffer? ﻿Tomer, Mosquito, come here! ﻿Kid? ﻿What're you doing here? ﻿Do you speak Hebrew? ﻿Kid, it's your... ﻿How do you say "dog" in Arabic? ﻿Kalb. -Kalb? ﻿What's he mumbling about? ﻿I don't know, but these Bedouins bug me. ﻿Chill, Tomer, he's just a kid. ﻿Next time he should tie his dog up. ﻿Let's go. -Go? We can't leave a kid in the middle of the desert. ﻿He probably lives here. He'll manage. ﻿Every dog has his day. ﻿Didn't I tell you to stop filming? ﻿What? -Turn off the camera. ﻿Delete all the footage with the dog ﻿or I'm calling this off. ﻿Don't worry, I'm just... -Delete it. ﻿I'm telling you... -Delete it, now! ﻿Delete it. ﻿I'm on your side, you know. ﻿Are you gonna delete it? ﻿Okay. ﻿Okay. ﻿Here, I'm deleting it. ﻿It's deleted. ﻿Wanna see? ﻿What time do you have? ﻿Three-thirty. ﻿That's what my watch says. We can't have been out that long. ﻿Cyclamen 5 to CO Cyclamen, do you copy? ﻿Cyclamen 5 to CO Cyclamen, do you copy? ﻿Turn it up, I can't hear. ﻿Is that Hochman again? ﻿Maybe the Egyptians are on our frequency. ﻿Try the alternate frequency. ﻿Fucking... -Let me do it. ﻿What did you do? ﻿Turned it off. It's driving me nuts. ﻿What if they try to find us? ﻿There's no reception here anyway. ﻿Let's keep going. ﻿There, that's that hill, ﻿that's the ravine, we're 2 km from the camp. ﻿Cool. -If this is that ridge ﻿and this is the gully we were in before... ﻿Then it's north-by-northeast. ﻿No, no. -Then what? ﻿It's further east. ﻿Then it's east-by-northeast. ﻿Let's go. ﻿You hold onto the map. ﻿Here, you didn't drink all night. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Ten hours. Embarrassing. ﻿If the CO asks... I'll tell him it went fine ﻿and I slowed you down so I could film. ﻿Those bastards slept all night ﻿and didn't even come looking for us. ﻿When we get there ﻿I'm waking everyone up with a trance party. ﻿Bronchitis, you sticking around for the rave? ﻿No, I have to be in Tel Aviv at nine. ﻿Don't forget to find me a girlfriend. ﻿An NCO, a cleaning lady, I'm not picky. ﻿Rolling. -Do a good job, ﻿then we'll put it on YouTube. Run after me. ﻿What're you gonna do? ﻿You'll see. ﻿They're probably fast asleep. ﻿Let's party! ﻿Good morning whores! Good morning my whores! ﻿Good morning whores... ﻿Nobody's here! ﻿Where are they? This can't be. ﻿Is this where we left from? ﻿Don't you remember? ﻿And we were supposed to come back here? ﻿Yes, for fuck's sake! ﻿The camp should be here! ﻿Are we sure this is the place? ﻿Yeah. Maybe they just... ﻿My car. ﻿Bedouin bastards stole your car. ﻿Any signal? ﻿No, nothing. ﻿We're wasting time, let's start walking. ﻿Walk where, Tomer? ﻿We're out of food, we're totally lost, this pencil-pusher didn't bring water and ours is running out. ﻿Where do you expect to go? ﻿That's the dirt road we took yesterday, right? ﻿Right? ﻿We'll reach the road in 40 minutes, tops. ﻿They can't have just left without us. ﻿They must've been called up to Gaza. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Anyone have water? ﻿Can I have some water? ﻿All gone. ﻿is mine. ﻿We'll get water when we reach the road, c'mon. ﻿What's going on? ﻿That kid is following us. ﻿Let's grab him, he'll show us the way. ﻿Where'd he go? ﻿Must be hiding somewhere, ﻿the little shit. ﻿Water... Water! ﻿Water! ﻿Wait. ﻿Wait! ﻿What? ﻿You don't know what died in there. ﻿Our orders are clear, no drinking from unknown sources. ﻿We have no water! It's an emergency! ﻿Listen to me, Mosquito. -Fuck the orders! ﻿Whoa, that's good. ﻿Mosquito's dick is long and thick. ﻿Mosquito's dick is as big as a brick. -Hey! ﻿He does Rona, he screws Sharon. ﻿He makes all the girls moan and groan. ﻿Film me, Bronchitis, it'll get the girls interested. ﻿Won't it? ﻿Get out of the water, Mosquito. ﻿No, sir. ﻿It's getting dark. ﻿Fuck you, sir. ﻿Mosquito. ﻿Yes, Ido. Yes, sir. ﻿Want me to kiss your ass, sir? ﻿What can I do for you? ﻿What do you want? ﻿Come on, bro, ﻿get over here. ﻿What a clown, huh? ﻿Who are you calling a clown, huh? I'll fuck you up! ﻿Who's a fuckin' clown? You won't fuck anybody up. ﻿Aviv's just joking. Only you get to joke, Mosquito? ﻿He didn't mean it, right, Bronchitis? ﻿Just joking, Mosquito. Lighten up. ﻿It's okay, I was joking, too. ﻿Good. Now let's go. ﻿Film me, Bronchitis, I have a killer joke. ﻿No jokes now. ﻿Come on. ﻿This guy, a virgin, ﻿he's always telling jokes about sex, ﻿sex, sex, sex. ﻿Truth is, he's never seen a pussy in his life. ﻿Let's go, Mosquito. ﻿Then suddenly he dies. ﻿Dies. Just like that. C'mon! ﻿Here he comes, the idiot. ﻿What's up with him? ﻿I don't know, but I'm losing my patience. ﻿You okay? ﻿Let's go. ﻿feel kind of funny. ﻿Me too. ﻿Maybe we didn't drink enough. ﻿Maybe we drank too much. ﻿Mosquito? ﻿Tomer? ﻿Tomer? ﻿Mosquito... ﻿Mosquito! Get up! ﻿Wake ﻿Wake up, Mosquito! ﻿Mosquito! Tomer! Tomer! Tomer! ﻿Tomer... ﻿Somebody was here. -Huh? ﻿Somebody was here! ﻿I can't wake Mosquito up. ﻿I can't wake him up and there are these rocks around us, ﻿someone put them around us, we're in the middle of nowhere. ﻿Where are we? ﻿Isn't that the road we were walking on? ﻿Yuval! ﻿Yuval, you moron, you think this is funny? ﻿Did you put the rocks around us? ﻿Another one of your dumb jokes? Answer me! ﻿Is this another one of your dumb jokes? Answer me! ﻿It's the water, ﻿there was something in the water. ﻿Can you walk, Mosquito? ﻿Gimme your hand. ﻿Let's get to the road before it's dark. We won't reach the road. Someone's playing with us. ﻿You don't know what's going on or where to go. ﻿Got a better idea? ﻿We'll reach the road in 40 minutes, huh? ﻿You have no idea where we are, do you? ﻿Mosquito. ﻿Gimme the map. ﻿Where's the map? ﻿Don't tell me you lost it. ﻿It wouldn't help, anyway. ﻿It wouldn't help? ﻿It sure would, idiot. -Leave him alone. ﻿What's that? ﻿Did you say something, Bronchitis? -It's your fault! ﻿Look where you got us. ﻿And you would've got us somewhere? ﻿Can you even hold a compass? You loser. ﻿You fatso. ﻿Stop it. -Can you even hold a compass? ﻿Watch your mouth. ﻿What'll you do? ﻿What are you laughing at? ﻿What'll you do, huh? ﻿Look! ﻿Tomer, what're you doing? ﻿No, Tomer, don't shoot him.
