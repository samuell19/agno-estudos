Para?so. Get off at S?. Take the red line... up to Rep?blica. Nina? Nina. UNDERGROUND GAME Is it you, Nina? No. It wasn't you. I feel like I've seen you before in one of those old pictures. Maybe it's you, Sofia. That's it Sofia. Don't even think about getting off here. It's now, Sofia. When the train leaves the tunnel, you'll get up. It's now. Excuse me. The green line, Sofia. The green line, Sofia. GREEN LINE EXIT A smile to forget your sorrows. - What the hell? - I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. What's the matter with you? No, take it easy. Silvia. Is it your smile, or your hands? Not yet, Silvia. No, Victoria. Sorry. Sweetie, lady's earring. Mommy's earring. Mommy's ring. Victoria's ring. Victoria, don't! Calm down. Calm down, Victoria. Calm down, sweetheart. Stop it, Victoria! Easy now. It's going to be all right. It's over. Calm down, Victoria. Everything's all right now. I'll give you an earring just as beautiful as that one. Okay? Look at mine. Look, here. Take a look. Now Victoria and mommy are going home. Victoria is going to give me her hand... Hand! And we're going to leave here together. Okay? We took you out of your way. Victoria wanted me to get off here. Didn't you, Victoria? Not a whole one left to tell the tale. And all because of those earrings. More tea? When she was born, she was very quiet. I went to the doctors. Nobody can explain it. They say autistics live in a world of the own... unaware of how to love or be loved. But I don't believe that. - Victoria! - It's okay. It's alright. It was my mother's. Nobody plays the piano here. I don't know how to thank you. Get the piano tuned. I don't know how to tell you. It was the way he said it. - What? - He said that... Blurt it out! He said I was driving him crazy. Oh, my God, forget it. Typical of you. The guy is crazy for you. And you, playing dumb. I've never done that thing. Now it's your turn, Laura. That's why he wants you. He looked at my mouth and I wanted to... You want to play hard to get... - It's not about wanting... - What do you mean? Some things you can't choose. I'm not sure I want to get involved. I only do what I want. Be careful! That's what happens for snooping in people's lives. Those two on the train. I wanted to know the end of the story. I wasn't paying attention. Yes, you were looking at me. You were following me. No, I was watching you. I thought you were smiling at me. Soft hand, slender fingers... feels like a woman's hand. - What's your face like? - My face? - Yeah, your forehead? - Well, I think it's wide. - Your eyes? - Dark. Not big or small. I don't know. I'm not ugly, but I'm not handsome either. You are handsome. I'll walk you up to the street. - Who said I was leaving? - Well, you got off here. Those women on the train... Neither of them said what matters: both want the same man. - How do you know? - I made it up. Okay. It's not every day you get to meet a blind writer. He's not just any gambler. He wants to find the woman of his dreams. A romantic. And what is this game he plays? He predeterminates a route, he chooses a woman... and hopes she takes the same route. Why would someone invent such a game? -He doesn't want to make any more mistakes. -In that way? Maybe there aren't any others left... Has it ever worked? Never. It's almost impossible... maybe, like all players, it's the game he wants the most. Nobody plays to lose. But if he wins, the game is over. - I'm getting off. - No, wait ! - And the rest of the story? - You made it up. In this story I prefer reality. I won't forgive you if you disappear. See you around. See you around... I had the piano tuned. What if that woman goes back, looking for her earring? It's been there for ages. You should see that office... people even forget their dentures. I like it, but it makes me angry. It's like clothes I can't take off. With Toni, it'll always be like this: I end up doing what he wants. He's a seductive guy, but also very selfish. When I got pregnant, I had to support the baby all on my own. Do you still see each other? Finished! Is this what you really wanted? Now you're always going to have me with you. I wish I had met you in different way How's that? If it weren't for Victoria I wouldn't be here. It was just chance. So what's the problem? That's the way people meet. People find each other and lose each other. Don't forget your jacket. I'm not going to give you a name; you're the one who's going to tell me yours. It's you; it has to be... Two lines... the same destination. Now the last step: Purple line, purple line. PURPLE LINE BLUE LINE It's you! Excuse me. One return ticket, quickly! Why are you following me? Tell me! Who sent you? What do you mean? Nobody sent me. - Haven't we met somewhere else? - Why? - Haven't we met somewhere else? - I don't know. - How come you don't know? - I don't think so. I wouldn't forget. - The same destination. - What? I saw you and I thought: ''The same destination.'' But you were going somewhere else. Your destination wasn't the same as mine. Even so, I thought we couldn't just separate this way... without ever having met. How romantic... Forget it. I still think we've met somewhere before Really? Hi. I tried to talk to you. What did you expect me to do? Of course I'm mad. I'm scared. I can't even go back home! I'm not going back there today. I'm not crazy. No, it's okay. I can handle it. We'll talk about it later. You were saying...? The silence doesn't bother me. That's good... It's what I right need now. - What do you do? - I work in a bar. Keep playing... If he played this stuff when the bar was open, he'd get fired. I liked it. Is it yours? No, it's by a guy called Villa-Lobos. Come on, are you gonna turn snob on me? I know more than you may imagine. - I don't imagine anything. - I know. You have no imagination... or curiosity. It's just that I don't like to pry in people's live's. It's a lie. That's done it... I swear I didn't mean it. It's broken! Broken... Is there a hotel nearby? Yeah. Mine. I know important guys. One is the big boss of a recording company. Maybe I can arrange something for you. Heavens, what have I got myself into? I'm sorry, okay? I've slept in worse places than this. It's okay. You're not going to get ideas... just because I asked you to sleep here? Now I do have imagination... The way I am, you could do anything you liked with me... I didn't even offer you. I don't want it. You want to hear the good or the bad part? One doesn't exist without the other. The player met a woman. A beautiful woman. - Did you see her? - No, of course not. Your though luck... Now the bad part: The woman bewitched him. Got him to break the rules of the game. You already know everything, why bother telling the rest? He wants to forget this woman. Anyway, he knows anything about her. It seems she's in trouble. Men like complicated women. He won't rest until he sees her again. He won't do that. It's the game matters more to him. What is this guy made of? Stone? - This guy's got a dream. - A dream... What do you need this other line for? It won't make any difference. The customer is always right. Why don't you admit you only came here to see me? It was also to see you. It was only to see me. And what if I love you, Martin? I don't want to deceive you. Don't worry. I know how to take care of myself. Victoria. Victoria. Victoria. So... do you like it? I like the flame. I lost one just like this a long time ago. Perhaps this is the one. This one's different. I wanted to see you again. I've already told you not to lie down here you lazy kitten! Tuti, Martin. Easy, kitty. Hey, come on, come on... Okay. You're hungry, aren't you? Isn't the food you steal from the neighbors enough, Tuti? Hi Ana, it's Franco. The new collection's arrived. I can only hold the coat until Friday. Call me back, okay? I'll be right back. Hi, it's Lia. I already called ''Look'', thanks. Call me, kisses. Hi Ana, what happened to your cell phone? I spoke to the Secretary. Everything's taken care of. But you did cross the line. I've set up a meeting to smooth things out but need to talk to you. Call me as soon as you can. Hello, are you there? I've spent the afternoon waiting. I'm losing my patience. If you don't call me soon, I'll have to... A lot of people looking for you. Lots of work. I'm tired of running. Who? And you said I was here? Shit! I don't have a minute of peace? What happened? I'm going to get out off here! I can't take it anymore. Come with me, Martin! Come on, there's it's all right, I swear! It's in the south, almost in Rio Grande: ''Porto Desejado''. If it exists, it's not in the map. I remember a lighthouse; it must be very small. That's what the fishermen called it: Porto Desejado. I remember it. During a storm, the thing we most want is a safe port... Preferably, one that exists. Of course it exists! I always wanted to return. Good times. My father used to bring me starfish from the sea. I must have been very young... We'll find it. Mercedes? I was about to call you. No, I know, I got your messages. I can hardly hear you... Hello? I can hardly hear you. You've got to tell me why you sent that idiot to my house! No, I had to leave. Of course I'm working, as always. What? How am I supposed to know how long? That depends... Hello? Hello? It suddenly crossed in front of us. It doesn't matter. It was only an animal. Only an animal? What's the difference? Are you serious? Even the most disgusting animal is worth more than a man. Martin! Martin! - What happened? - I'm leaving. I don't really know what I'm doing here. What? What are you doing? What is this, Martin? It's this or me? This or me? Come with me, Martin. Why? Come with me. Thank you. There's a camera in the glove compartment. Get it, take a picture of me. I want to remember what I'm feeling now. Can you tell what it is? This must be happiness, not having to account to anyone. Keep still! That woman's going to drive me crazy. What does she want? I did something stupid. She got me a good job. I can't complain, but I'm tired. One day I had enough, I lost my head. I don't think she trusts me anymore. And that guy that went to your apartment? Martin, please, I don't want to talk about it now. You know very well what you got yourself into... Your good luck, my bad luck... All the rooms are vacant. Here it is. I picked the best one. That's mine, get him another one. I snore a lot... Oh, I see. Do you know a small village down south? Porto Desejado? Porto Desejado... No, I don't. At least some of my secrets you already know. Really? You've already taken a picture of my soul. You don't fool me... - I'm sure we've met before. - Really? - Where? - I saw you in a park. I was a little boy... you were a baby with a pink ribbon in your hair. I saw you and then I thought: ''You'll be my girlfriend someday, beautiful little girl.'' So it was you! I fell in love too. Well, maybe I fell in love with your cap. Wait for the right moment. Like a samurai. A samurai? Don't answer. No, I can't! I can't! Hello? No, I wasn't asleep. I was going to call you, but I can't talk now. What? No, I won't do it! I won't do it! I can shout too, Mercedes! Why me? I understand fine, now you're threatening me. Okay, I'll go back tomorrow ! Why do you have a gun? Have you been snooping into my things? - My lighter wasn't working. - Oh, really? - Don't you believe me? - Yes, I do. I carry a gun to feel safe when I go out. Do you believe me? What the hell! I'm tired of having to explain everything I do! You take care of your life and... I didn't ask to take a trip, or to listen your conversations. We should never have met. Take this. You're going to need it. - You disappeared. - I couldn't find you. You're the one who didn't try to find me. I told you I pass by here everyday. What do I say now? You're forgiven. I didn't have anything to tell you anyway. He stopped for a while. Got derailed. Looks like it. But he's playing the game again. It's like a religion, an addiction. - What's the difference? - It's not like it used to be... Things change. He's probably forgotten that woman. I don't know. There's something strange about her... there're things she doesn't tell. No woman tells everything. He saw a gun in her purse. Did he look inside her purse? Does he trust her or doesn't he? She's the one who doesn't trust. Maybe it would've been better if they had never met. Lovers always say that. It's a clich? from cheap romantic novels. There must be some truth in it. The truth is that this friend of yours doesn't know if he's playing the game or if it's the game is playing with him. Martin! It seems to be urgent. Try to be quick about it. Ana, what's up? I just wanted to hear your voice! Come on over, I want to see you now. If you don't coming tonight, don't bother coming again. Martin, the phone. Martin... Martin... I didn't think I'd still find you here. No! Wait. - What? - Wait. Wait. If you want, I can leave. I don't. A scar. A tattoo. A scar. Go on, cry. What for? Who knows? It'd take so little to be happy There are things you should know Like what? Not now. I want to forget. Forget what? So many things. I've never liked someone this way. I don't even know who you are. Maybe it's better this way, not knowing much about each other. - Promise me something. - What? Just tell me when you don't want to see me anymore. Don't let things die slowly. One, two... three, blow! Aren't you going to blow them out, Victoria? Blow them, honey. I didn't want to cry. You can cry. She can't see you. Martin, it was Victoria who wanted you to come. I don't know if it's fair to her, but I don't want you to come here anymore. If you prefer Tania? Toni? You took so long. Do you know Martin? And Victoria? - Want something to drink? - Sure. Martin! How did you get in here? I brought champagne. Do you want some? To begin with, I want this guy out of my house. To begin with, I think you should lower your voice. Or have you forgotten whom this house belongs to? In fact, it's been quite a while since you last paid me the rent. Didn't this idiot tell you I returned the car? No amount of money will pay what you owe me. Come on, Mercedes, spit it out ! Come on over here, come on... Ana, what's going on? You have the best of everything. I've always treated you like a daughter. Daughter!!! I'm the best deal you've ever made! So okay. Let's say you're right. What's so wrong with that? I never hid anything from you. That's why I invested in you! - I made your reputation. - I make my own reputation! Or do you have to put up with those pigs grunting over you? Ana, don't exaggerate... I've always been choosy with our clients. They all disgust me! You've changed. You've changed a lot. Now you're being choosy because you know they want you. I've had enough, Mercedes. It's gone too far. Too far? How come too far? Have you forgotten how much they pay you for a fuck? You think you can call it a day... and do whatever you like? Did you have to make a scene with the Secretary for Security? The guy shoves his filthy shoe between my legs in a restaurant! And you threw a glass of wine in his face! He'll have to send his greasy suit to the cleaners. What about me? Don't I mean anything? Who knows what those cops wanted? I barely escaped into the subway! Your foolishness may cost me my license. Get lost Mercedes! Get out of my apartment! Out! - Take it easy, kitten. - Let me go! Now what? Isn't this how you make your living? Huh? You accepted the rules... made money, things aren't like you think... In fact, I came here on business. There's a party in two days. They want you in the aquarium. You and me. So get ready. Let her go, Tadeu. Calm down and cool of. You're still going to accept my champagne You swear you're not here to ask any more questions... Yes. I just came to finish what I began. I want you inside me. Don't leave me, my love, don't leave me. I'm scared... I'm really getting to like you. Let's go to Porto Desejado. We'll open a bar, you can play piano. Stop dreaming. We don't even know if this place exists. Always something. I don't know what you want anymore. You do know very well. But that's impossible. Know why? Because you've got another woman. I've already told you that's not true! Or is it ''women''? The one with the dark glasses! - The one who does tattoos! - Have you been following me? Isn't that what you do? Follow women in the subway like you did with me? What kind of collection is this? I bet you don't even remember who's who! It's not that. You wouldn't understand... You're very strange, Martin. The more I'm with you, the less I know you. She won't come back anymore. Maybe he is relieved. He couldn't lie anymore. That was the best way to end it. Happiness doesn't interest me. It never makes for good stories. I don't give a damn about what interests you! You think the world is a story you made up? I'm not a character. I'm real! And what's that to you? You know damn well. Deep down, you're just like me. But I'm lucky, I'm blind. The world is just the way I want it to be. But what about you? You created your own game... and ended up with different one. With no rules... unpredictable. It's not your call anymore. Open yours eyes, Martin. Love can cause a lot of pain. Now you're crying, huh? The life of a madam... Imported perfumes... Fancy clothes... The best money can buy. If only you'd thought a little I told you I wouldn't go. The clients wanted to see you in the aquarium! I was all ready my dick painted with the colors of the flag. Can you imagine how disappointed those guys were standing around that glass ball just for us? You ruined the party! Why couldn't you show them a good fuck? Money was good; everything would have been fine. Now here you are... Down and out. Where am I gonna brand this little cow? On this beautiful face? On this shoulder? On this tits? On this little tummy? Come on! I don't wanna lose my patience! Stop! Who's there? Shoo, fucking cat! Shoot, you bitch. Go on. Have you ever shot anyone? You think it's easy? It's not even loaded. Give me the key. Give me the key! Here it is. Here it is. I should kill you. I should have branded you. Tell Mercedes never again. Never again! Tell me again, clearly. I'm tired. I already told you, it was an accident. Hold me. That's enough, Ana. I'm tired of your lies. I thought it was over. Why did you decide to come back? What happened to you? What happened to this room? Don't change the subject. Answer my question! You really thought I wasn't coming back. Did you? Ana... I want to tell you something. I don't have any right to be with you. Any right? What are you talking about? You'll think I'm crazy... maybe I am. That notebook... Those names you read in it... I should never have met you. - I should have left you. - What are you trying to say? That you lied to me all this time? I lied to myself... trying to convince myself of something that just couldn't be. What are you saying? That you don't love me? Is that it? I don't know anymore. I'm the one who doesn't know. I don't know if you're crazy or just a coward. - Where are you going? - What difference does it make? Ana... I wish I could start it all over again. But the right way. You've already made too many mistakes better not to make another one. Hey, look. I'm going. Come on, fella. There're no more trains tonight. I have vanilla, chocolate, lemon, coconut, chocolate chip You got kiwi? Kiwi, Toni! - Try the yogurt one. - Yogurt? - You got yogurt? - Yogurt with strawberry. Victoria... you want to play it? Victoria? Victoria! Victoria! Your mom's calling you, Victoria. Go on.
