I have a feeling point. My paintings are trivia. Alma. All invitation. But they betray my taste for the finer things. I believe I was born for the trappings of great luxury and to what. But so far I've been coasts with the wrong set trappings. I was looking for a medallion mister wider. A small thing. Sobek. With a twin dragon correspondence. Has been lost for two thousand years and then recently the gamer pause to turn up again. On the other side. In red China. One of them got it of course. That's why he was murdered. Other interested parties. For instance. My office. I bring you here and you try to get information out of me. Using devils. Killed animal genie the fu song or. A jewelry brand. Joey Brandon's a name the other sounds like a cure for a hangover. I assure you the cure nothing. Except perhaps a desire to go on living. The fu song is. Chinese tang as old as history itself. Joe Brandon is the local leader of an American gambling syndicate and between them they control all that is dark and dirty and how charming. Community. Not everything. Are you mean. Being too modest. Medallion what makes US so special. Well. And if the time comes remembered as I was gracious enough to tell you. My heart. The medallion holds the key to an ancient treasure. With. The summer's too staggering for anyone to be shot. Five million ten. Gone. Is a historical fact that an emperor of the third dynasty was bad. It is also a fact that his crown jewels and septa remain with him. The septa so encrusted with emeralds that no gold can be seen the crown so heavy that no mortal man could ever read a symbol of. Power. Rubies. Diamonds sapphires. And the smallest as thick as a man's fist. Cheers. Eu. At. Your home. Why. Why not. Because my travels around the US aren't even if you don't have a medallion. Thank you to. Any they in particular. That lot back then. Are they whose son or joy brown. One of each. I just have to split me up the middle. Just do that. Hotel Paloma. Mr why.

Very reasonable we will call for you in thirty minutes. Wait a minute I forgot I haven't got any equipment or no problem. Lady of the house will be along in. Equipment it is all around. Good afternoon mister. Didn't tell me you was so handsome. Everyone agrees. Am I what you expected. I expected more muscles and not as well raged. I'm afraid I don't understand. You see my English is not very good. English is just gorgeous. How do we begin. Your five hundred dollars an hour. To consider that excessive. That's what I have to do for. Take my picture. That is ridiculous. Perhaps you'd like to be paid in. Payment. I'm not kidding my. Job is I'm happy to say. Let me help you. Are doing fine. No I'm serious. Joey Brandon wants to keep. Why you know. Soda you. Realise you could have made love to me before admitting you were suspicious. Very attractive. What am I supposed to say. What a nice girl like you get mixed up with a bunch of cutthroats like the fu sun you know that too. I always was good at arithmetic. That. Is by being here you might be in danger maybe. Of course I. Could put both hands around your. Neck and let you walk me safely out of here. Go ahead. Squeeze. Chance. Very good. I keep thinking you must have made the same offer to Danny man Cheney. Member of staff with this please. He made a mistake and now he must suffer for it nobody disobeys. Display much curiosity mister Martin. You don't even ask what mistake that unfortunate man made. He was impetuous. Very stupidly killed a man. Killed Danny mentioned. We are not animals as to why. We get no pleasure from. We do use it. We will use it against you if necessary. I see I'd come at an opportune bulk. Ugh. Trouble with this. Game. I promised I'd give you a lift back to the hotel at that time definitely. Stipe. Told I was just leaving splendid. Good day. Finish. Freedoms of you. Called me before you. The stupidity of. Nice to meet the people in. Room I came up with. Song as interested in. Can only be for the same reason. I had given you up as a possible clue. About. Feels I was too hasty. I hope that. What do you think daddy plan to do with it but. Is it himself. Or set it to the highest bidder. To certain interested parties and they died. I think in negotiation one might expect to get. Familiar. Or a knife in the back. One I want to see. Better I tried there. Fuck. Outta luck. That miss your. Article it was half a million. To make a deal on leaving the eu just that. You don't know what you're walking into. Okay let's play charades. Get this damn off my back and tell Brandon I want to see him he wants to see you too. Tuck. I don't like the way the fu son play. So so I'm learning to talk a deal with you. Do. You want the medallion yes. What do you want. Half a million dollars. Deal. Think finance Danny's trip. Who do you think invested in that trinket. I spent time my own time finding how and where it could be got. Money and lives that's what it cost me. It's mine. It belongs to me. Where is it. I think he's going to be stubborn. Talking you had water. Three just tell me when. That we might have to carry. Bullshit. Something's gone wrong. Coming of. Three. At. Wendy. It is very simple mister lauder. You have something we want. You will give it to US. It is very simple. Where is the medallion. It is ours by right. The treasure is Chinese it belongs to the Chinese people in general are just huge two in particular. You do not understand. It's part of our heritage.

It does. You have achieved nothing but. Chaos confusion. You have got under one another's feet. Yet the fortunate stake is so large there would be more than enough to share. The device of the. Twin dragons as an ancient. Symbol of wisdom. Two heads. Are better than one. I propose an alliance of convenience foods so allied to a head of cheap gangsters both after the same thing that we should have to divide two rains three ways the lady. Why should we cut you in. My media to speak. Also you won't find the medallion without me. I have information. It's agreed then. Splendid. It will be a tenuous partnership. But a happy one. Now my information is that mr Wilder no longer has the medallion brilliant content and you know very slept last night. In Lila's room. She must be questioned.
