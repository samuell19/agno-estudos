PUNISHMENT ROOM Screenplay by Natto Wada & Keiji Hasebe Based on a work by Shintaro Ishihara Starring: Hiroshi Kawaguchi Keizo Kawasaki Ayako Wakao Yosuke Irie, Masayoshi Umewaka, Masaya Tsukita, Seiji Mizoguchi, Teruko Kishi, Noburo Nakamura Directed by Kon Ichikawa Excuse me, I'm representing Kyowa Bank. I was here the other day. I heard. Now's not a good time. Are you the owner? I'm the Vice President of the Koenji branch. This is a small factory, and our sales barely cover costs. I’m sure you’re busy. I’ve taken the liberty of drawing up an estimate for a loan. I already have a bank that I deal with. I’m sure that you do. This location is actually quite lovely. Just a stone’s throw from the barley fields. Get me tea! Banking’s gotta be a tough racket. Maybe you could come some other time. Thanks to the change in the commercial code, regulations on bank advertising have been lifted. I noticed that a cafe had opened up down the road. It would seem that the local population has risen to make it viable. Not a chance. That store opened because we sell bread and cake to them. How many months do you think they’ll be there? I was in business before them, and if you want to run a cafe, you should be by the station, or in Shinjuku. I plan to open up in Shinjuku myself… Albeit, in an alley. Isn’t that him? - I managed to collect on the loan. - Glad to hear it. While I was there I stopped at two or three businesses. I might be able to find a customer. Dad, I need a favor. - What do you want? - Is there somewhere we can talk? This is my dad. Pleased to meet you. I’m Hideo Ito. I know you’re busy, so I’ll get straight to the point. I have a debt certificate that I’d like to sell the bank. - What is this? - It’s nothing suspicious… It was issued by Yajima Mining to Monzaemon Ito… in the amount of ¥1.8 million. Monzaemon Ito is my father. Did you notice that the agent bank is Yamaguchi? The situation is that my father is away in South America, and we’re in urgent need of cash. My mother told me to cash it. We waited over an hour for you to get back! I have to take my medicine. - Medicine? - It’s his stomach. Is this Yamaguchi Bank? I’m calling from the Koenji branch of Kyowa Bank. You were the agent of a debt certificate issued for… Yajima Mining, to be redeemed on July 1. For ¥1.8 million. Is it in default? You think it will be all right? That’s its status. We can’t purchase debt certificates that we didn’t issue. No bank will. If you like, I can introduce you to a lending institution. Since today's May 15 and the certificate comes to term on July 15, a lending institution will only pay ¥1.5 million out of the JP¥1.8 million. We’ll be throwing away ¥300,000. All we need is ¥30,000. - "We," means you and Katsumi? - Yeah. What’s this money got to do with you? Nothing you know about. Old man, if you make an exception in this case, we’d be happy to buy it off you when it comes due. You stand to gain, too. A loan of ¥1.8 million is impressive. You’re talking nonsense! It’s just a piece of paper at this point. It could stay that way forever. Then take it as collateral for a ¥30,000 loan. Wait here. Excuse me. Could you withdraw ¥30,000 from my account? That was easier than I thought. Such is the case with Weber… Come on in, Katsumi. It’s the tri-university research conference. You should show up from time to time. Ryoji, where have you been? I’ve been looking all over. It’s been so long, I stopped waiting for you. The whole gang’s together. At the dorm? Therefore, by focusing on nothing but social class, and ignoring spiritual culture… this will ultimately lead to misguided historical materialist thinking. Please speak more slowly. I can’t follow your argument. The shortcoming of historical materialism is the notion that… the fruit of human thought should be relegated to being a substructure. Fundamentally, social substructures stipulate the spirit, so ultimately, the spirit and consciousness are secondary. I don’t think we can definitively say so. No? If spiritual culture had no significant meaning, then mankind would lose all privileges afforded it as a thinking animal. - I’m not so sure. - Why not? Isn’t this just a difference in designation of the concept of values? - It’s not that simple. - That’s exactly what I’m saying. Spirit and consciousness are the products of actions in our everyday lives. - So that values are created from action? - The idea is lopsided. No, please continue on this tangent. The various actions that make up our daily activities… should determine human thinking. We cannot conclude that the proof of our own existence… is predicated on our consciousness and spirit. What is necessary is to pin down the realization of our daily activities, little by little, through trial and error. The first question to settle is the creation of a thesis that spirit comes from… your actions that arise out of the realization of your daily activities. That’s the dynamic… I have an appointment. Let’s wrap it up for today. I’m quite busy. Thank you for meeting with us, Professor. It’s quite all right. We understand how busy you must be. It’s my job. My students and I were just discussing criticisms of Weber. My work on the matter has not yet been published. I’m terribly sorry about the one-month delay, but the Editor-in-Chief has said it will definitely be published. There's someone I was supposed to meet with today. I’d like to finish up by 6:00… Professor! I’m glad I came! It was very interesting! It was all the more interesting when you left in the middle! You sure put your two cents in! You were fab! The whole thing was a crock. We got time to kill, so let’s make sure it dies well. Hey, Yoshimura! - You got a crush on her! - Don’t be absurd. She’s from K University… Is it that obvious? Pffft! Should we call it the "USIS Dance Party"? How many tickets can we sell? Last year we hawked 500 just to the rugby team. True. 500 tickets at ¥200 means a take of ¥100,000. A five-way split is ¥20,000 each. Hot damn! You dope! The dance hall will be ¥15,000. The band, ¥20,000, and getting the tickets printed, ¥10 each - that’s ¥5,000 in total. Also, people won’t come if all we have is a band. A take of ¥60,000 - it ain’t hay. - Those gigs sometimes lose money. - It’s OK, trust me. Then I want 10% interest. You’re the bourgeoisie, you don’t collect interest. Nobody provides capital for free. What’s everybody having? - Water. - Skinflint. Shut yer yap, Ito. Water, please. Did that debt certificate really come from your mom? Something like that. Maybe you could spot me ¥1,000? I’m selling ice cream at the party. You got gall! Begging for money for your business. I want 10% off the top. Assuming we take ¥50 Gs, let’s plough it into a used three-wheeler. You can make ¥10,000 a month in transport services. Come in, sir! - That’s ¥2,000 a month each. - Forget it! If I get ¥10,000, it’s going into my pocket. What? And give some girl a present? They give me presents, I don’t give them a nickel. I’m sorry to have troubled you. Haru? It’s me. When Katsumi comes home, tell him to stay put. I’ll be home around 9:00. I’m going out. At this hour? Don’t go playing mah-jong. I didn’t say anything about mah-jong. Your father called and said for you to stay home. Why? Well… just stay here. Katsumi, your father will be angry with me. That’s all I hear. You worry too much. You know how your father is. And you’ve got a smart mouth. Where does that leave me? Katsumi! Good evening, dear. Are you hungry? I can make noodles. Is your stomach all right? I received a letter from my brother. He wants to sell the mountain again. I haven’t been able to bring myself to read it yet… Shut up a minute! I need to talk to Katsumi. - Whattaya want? - Idiot! - You must be a total fool! - Honey, you promised Katsumi… - Haru, shut up! - Mom, get out! Do you have any thoughts about the world? It is what it is. And your performance at the bank today? That’s why you’re angry? I get it. You didn’t like it? You bet I didn’t! And I don’t like your attitude now! Just what do you think of me? You think that I’m the fool! Frankly, I’m disappointed in you. You’re conceited enough to be disappointed in me? You’ve got a weak stomach, no? In the morning, milk's the only thing you can drink. At night, noodles are the only thing you can eat. And you work all day, in your condition! You ain’t got the sense that God gave you! Do you think that I can just take a day off because my stomach hurts? Maybe if I was a student… And today, I gave you ¥30,000 out of my meagre savings. It was your choice. I turn down plenty of deals. You two were practically threatening me! What was I supposed to do in the bank… in front of my co-workers! That’s why I’m disappointed. You didn’t say what you needed the money for. - You’re not going to tell me? - I'll tell you. It’s to fund a dance party. Part-time jobs pay a pittance. We stand to make some real money here. You’re not happy with the money I give you?! You can’t buy a suit for ¥2,000. When you get into the real world, you’ll find out. I’ve struggled to get where I am. You talk big, but your school and your expenses come out of my pocket! So that’s what you wanted to say! I’ve had enough! Don’t ever come to the bank again. I’m trying to work. Haru, bring me the letter from your brother! USIS DANCE PARTY - Here it is! - Hurry up! Ice cream, please! Hold on, miss. It'll be ready in a moment. Thank you. This party's dead. All of the cute girls already have boys in tow. See that girl dancing with Katsumi? Anyone take odds on how high her skirt flares? Ain’t you got nuthin’ better to do? Wow, it’ll rise 180 degrees. I’ll bet you a cup o’ joe. Not a chance. It won’t twirl up as far as we’d like. Wait right there! Don’t say a thing until I get there! We need boys for a fight! It’s J University! You bet! - What about tabulating sales? - You handle it! I already gave the porter a tip. - To Takadanobaba! - Let's go! What’s wrong!? What’s wrong!? It’s finished already? It’s over. Takeshima's here. I’m sorry I asked you to come. You’d best leave quietly. Not a chance. I’ll handle it… Oh, this is a terrible injury! Your finger looks like it’s going to fall off! It sure looks painful! There are only four balls left on the table. And you’re getting to be a noisy pest. Maybe this cue would work better! A troublemaker, huh?! Stop fighting! Tuition. - You’re here to pay tuition? - No, to collect my scholarship. Why's Ryoji yammering with the career guidance officer? He’s on the board of a beer company. He’s vying for a job at the company. You have to be quick. SHINJUKU SPORTS LAND Hey, Katsumi. Are you stag tonight? Shut up! It’s barely dark. And I’m holding out for a cut above average. - True, but I’m getting desperate. - I don’t think Ryoji's coming. Maybe we missed him. He could be at the bar. Let’s go! They look like good pickings. Let’s give it a shot. Good evening. Good evening. Congratulations. It’s quite festive tonight. Those foreign goods are expensive. You girls are so nonplussed. You want to come with us? Okay. Cheers! You’re leaving, now that we’ve toasted the evening? - Yes, boys are scary. - You jest. I’m very shy. - Right, sonny? - I wonder. Is your name Sonny? You’re cute. Don’t embarrass me. Congratulations, everyone! Shut up, hick! Congratulate yourself! Light-hearted chump! Have a seat, don’t be shy. Beer. Akiko, you’ll have the same? Beer? No, we’d prefer sake. Sake. Hey. I met you at the conference. Oh, yeah! That was you. I completely forgot. Hey, it’s here! Let’s drink up! I’ll leave you to pour it. - This is good. - Nothing beats sake. You two are really something. Sake isn’t just for men. Would you like some, sonny? Those girls are a couple of cold fish. Nothing's going to happen here. - How did we end up hitched to them? - Don’t get ahead of yourself. I have a plan… Excuse me, miss! We can’t talk them into a hotel, but I thought we’d slip 'em a mickey. - A mickey? - Something to make them sleep. - As it’s going… - It’ll be more than you can handle. …whether you give it to them or not… - And Sonny? I haven’t told him yet. I’ll tell him later. Come in! I figured I’d find you here. Sorry I was late, I had a few things to take care of. - Did you see the party? - Not yet, how was it? Oh, we got something in the oven baking. - What is it? - Sleeping pills. We have some girls that we’re gonna score with. I’m shocked! This is a premeditated crime. If Ito’s involved, it stinks to high heaven. That doofus doesn’t even know the English alphabet. He’s a genius when it comes to pulling off a caper. I got no patience for someone who hooks up with an idiot like him. I came here to cut you in on the action. Me? No, thank you. - Why? - It’s not my scene. You got something better going on? Not really. But I don’t want to act like a fool. - It’s a phase. - A phase? Everyone does wild things when they’re young. "Wild things"? How old are YOU? Katsumi, do you really intend to go through with this? Damn straight. What’s the matter with you? Ryoji, you’re suddenly such a wet blanket. Are you being good because you have a foot in the door at the beer company? - All Ryoji's saying… - I wasn’t talking to you. Ryoji can speak for himself. Can I have a spoon, Rika? And paper? How’s this? - Let’s go. How much? - Y200. - Thank you. - You could get caught. Not if you keep your mouth shut. It’s partial consent. I just don’t like when they kick and flail. We’re just doing what they want to do, anyway. This way, we do away with the charade that they don’t want to. Isn’t that right, Rika? This isn’t completely your idea, is it? Ito is also in on it. Yoshimura, I’ll tell you something… One of the girls that we’re about to do this to is… the one that you’re sweet on from K University. Liar! Come and see for yourself. You can have first dibs. Katsumi! I don’t like girls that are both pensive and indecisive. Not a one of them knows what to do. Where did you go? Did you have something to take care of? You betcha. Where did you go? You left us behind. - I’m here now. - I can’t drink any more sake. Then have a beer. It’ll pep you up, and then we can go for a walk. - Where’s the restroom? - Outside and to the left. I’m going, too. Did the beer come? - What did you do that for? - Forget about it. He naps at all hours, and then when the rest of us go to bed, he’s up making a racket. It’s better this way, no? Drink up! This beer is bitter. The sake probably just tainted your palate. I don’t think so. One in our group fell asleep and we couldn’t wake him up. You can let him sleep for a while and then kick him out. - Are you all right? - No. I feel strange. You’ll feel better soon. I’ll help you. Sorry, the elevator’s busted. - What floor? - Fourth. - What room? - Sorry, room 49. - This place is something else. - This is your first time to visit? This is my place and my sister’s room is there. She’s at a friend’s birthday party and won’t be back tonight. This is a sweet deal. You don’t have to live with your mom. She’s in Oita prefecture. Hold on! Who says you get her? What’s the difference? If that’s how you feel, I’ll take her! - What if I prefer Akiko? - Paper-scissors-rock? Imbecile! You’re a greedy bastard! I was the one who bought the pills and I was the one who made them drink it! Then you said Aikawa was a nuisance and you wanted him out of the picture! Don’t make an issue of this! All right. Where am I? What is this place? Say something! Why don’t you talk? Why don’t you talk! Aren’t you the girl who debated me at the conference?! Women are all the same! Look at me! He said I couldn’t do anything! Katsumi said I couldn’t do anything! Forget about it. Who cares what he said? What do you know about it? About what I feel… - What he’s doing to Akiko! - Shut up, Yoshimura! Let him do as he pleases! Can he really look down on us?! Just because a man knuckles under as a wage slave doesn’t mean he’s a sucker! He doesn’t understand that! I feel sick! They say that a conscience brings misery! I feel the misery! Katsumi's actually sweet. We’ve been buddies since high school. We always ran around together. He still thinks he’s in high school. But I’ve changed! I’ve changed! What can you do? I’ll match you! Just watch! See who gets the last laugh! Nothing good will come of this for Katsumi! Am I wrong?! You’re evil. What were you thinking? - I’m telling the police. - Go ahead. Nobody will believe you. It’ll just look like a one-night stand. - You worm! - A woman can be talked into bed. - Not by you. - Thanks a lot! I hailed a taxi. We can’t let them stay here. We have to take them somewhere and leave them. OK? - Does anyone want to go for tea? - No, just take us home! Pull over! I’m going to buy some smokes. Do you have any change? Run! This isn’t the road. I thought you were going to Shimbashi. Are you going to stop off somewhere? We still have time to go to your Dad’s bank. My dad’s bank? What for? To pay back the money we borrowed from him. What the hell? Forget about it! Business is business. You can’t leave any loose ends. Geez, you’re weird. Aren’t you coming? He told me never to show my face here again. - What happened? - It's nothing. Go on in! You can take me to Ginza when you’re done. - What do you need in Ginza? - Nothing. What happened to that girl the other night? I haven’t heard a word from mine. You? - The same. - Hold on here a minute. I want to see you. Be at the Colondor in Ginza at 3:00 on the 7th. Akiko Aochi I’m here to pay you back the money you loaned me. ¥30,000. Please count it. - Thanks! - You helped us make some real money. Here’s a little something for the trouble. ¥1,000 I’d also like the debt certificate that we used as collateral. Oh, yes… I was hoping that you would entrust that with our bank… That was a one-time offer. I repaid the loan, so please return the debt certificate. Of course I will. But tell your father that he can stop by anytime. - I’ll tell him you said so. - Please come again soon. Thank you so much for stopping by. Your Dad’s very obedient. Let's go. Dammit. - May I help you? - Give me a minute. I’m sorry to have kept you. Thanks for the nice time the other day. I don’t want to think about that. - Why did you invite me, then? - I have my reasons. Two house cocktails. What happened to Keiko? She’s very depressed and won’t see anyone. - Did she go to the police? - I don't know. - How about you? - Me? - That depends on how you answer. - What, is this blackmail? - Bingo. Why did you choose me? - I liked you. - And now? You make me nervous. It makes me like you even better. - Don't lie. - Then why am I here? That’s what I want to know. What kind of explanation is that? You kill me. I like your carefree attitude. And that you’re pushy. So what of it? Are you telling me that I should like you, too? How carefree you are. - Is that wrong? - You sure do put on airs! I don’t know what it means to fall for a girl. Whenever one catches my attention, the feeling disappears before I really care for her. Like us? You aren’t very carefree. In any event, that’s about the extent to which I can date a girl. That’s all I need. I have to go. Bye-bye. Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea is really good. I haven’t read it yet, though. Cut the act. Why did he go to Osaka? I doubt he went just because he had the money. I thought we were going to see a movie. Anything playing? Anyone up for a game of Mah-jong? - Who cares? - About what? - Mah-jong. - True. - You want me to take your picture? - It won’t turn out well in this light. Who wants a photo of this motley crew, anyway? Ten, we’re going to take your photo, come here. Katsumi, come here. OK, don’t move. Come on upstairs. Leave me alone! What do you want?! Smile! Smile! - Did you get it? - Perfect. My turn. You up for a game of rugby?! Why not? Katsumi! Please rewrite it, but this is basically what you tell your brother: I don’t care how much he begs us, it's not easy to find a buyer for a mountain. I’m busy at work, but I did ask a trust bank to look into it. It’s a bum market to be selling a mountain anyway. He said he needed it for a cemetery plot. What’s the difference! Who cares how nice his grave is? Country folk sure show off their money in meaningless ways. - He needs a grave. - Balderdash! If there’s a death in the family, the remains have to go somewhere. - Give me the letter! - It’s right in front of you. - Not that! Katsumi’s! - Oh, that? You have it, don’t you? Is that the girl? - You need something? - Oh, you’re home. Why are you shaking down my room? Did you find anything good? Where did these photos come from? A dorm my friend is staying at, I think. How do you know this girl? Her? She works at the dorm. We didn’t do anything to her. You would have if she’d been prettier! A letter came. MR. HANYA SHIMADA - What is it? - Read it yourself. Let’s talk about this calmly downstairs. It says that you met some college girls after the league match, and that you drugged them and had your way with them! - You should be ashamed! - This is pretty lurid. Whoever wrote this has a vivid imagination. - So the letter is a prank? - It’s true. In parts. What parts are true?! They sort of went along with it. The girls didn’t go to the police. She’s practically my girlfriend. You’re like an animal! I was once a student at U University. When we were young, we were wild, too. But we knew right from wrong! Spare me the "when I was you’re age" crap. I've no interest in patterning my youth after yours. Maybe I should have a talk with Professor Motegi. Professor Motegi? I went to school with him, and Katsumi is in his seminar. Maybe he can help. - Why do you want to talk to him? - About you! This isn’t junior high. Professors don’t involve themselves in our personal lives. It won’t help. I won’t have you telling me what to do! He sees young people every day, and he'll know something about how you think. He won’t see you. What are you hoping to accomplish with this? - To clear up this problem! - This is a private matter. Do you really want to drag the professor into this? Katsumi needs to find a job when he graduates. Do you want to air the family’s dirty laundry? Haru, you don’t know a damn thing! Let Katsumi do as he pleases. And you can do the same. As for me, I’m happy enough as I am. Don’t make waves. No matter what you do, it won’t change anything. I can’t stomach your attitude! Your passivity's why Katsumi's such a nogoodnik! What did I do wrong? Nothing. I haven’t done anything. You… Your mother… Katsumi… You all just trample over me. I can’t be any more yielding… So just let me live quietly, as a mother! It’s time for bed. There, there… Hey, help me. Don’t cry. It won’t help. Professor Motegi's a busy man. Shut your mouth! MOTEGI RESIDENCE - You should take a day off tomorrow. - I’m all right. Shut up! Don’t you have any cough syrup? Professor Motegi is an odd duck. Your father went to his house for the third time tonight... and he still wasn’t home. Even though your father has made several appointments with him, the professor never keeps them. - He’s ducking you. I told you it was a waste of time. He’s busy fighting for world peace. Don’t speak ill of your professor that way. I’m sure he’s successful for a reason. Then why trouble him with your petty problems? I don’t have a problem… so long as you fill out a resume and meet with Mr. Saeki. Your father arranged for Mr. Saeki to find you a job. I’ll do it for you, Mom. But what does it have to do with me? You do plan to work after you graduate? How will you eat, if you don’t? You want me to end up like Dad?! What kind of a life is that? Is that what you think? He and his kind are dead inside! Not me! I’m going to live! I’m going to rebel! Go to bed. You’ll catch cold. I’ll buy your father some cough medicine tomorrow. But give a moment’s thought to why he caught a cold. He was overworked, trying to support this family. I don’t have to do everything you say. Do you think I’m going to show up every time you call me? I can’t be barging on to your campus all the time, either. What don’t you like about me? How am I supposed to answer that? I think we’re just sick of each other. - Then what was I to you? - A woman. Don’t talk like that. What else can I say? It’s like I told you before: I just don’t want you anymore. Simply put, if I saw you naked, I wouldn’t feel anything. The real marginal utility of cash is the extent to which… it is beneficial to carry it for the purpose of procuring goods and services. Similarly, like conventional goods, the marginal utility changes… depending on the total amount of cash in existence. The value of ¥100 in ¥10,000, and the value of ¥100 as a part of ¥1,000… Hey! This ain’t a carnival act! Come down here! The value of ¥100 as a part of ¥10,000 and the value of ¥100 as… a part of ¥1,000 depends on each actor’s individual marginal utility… Do want to hold another dance? You’ve changed your tune. Who will sponsor it? It would be to sponsor the academic council. They’re short on money. That stinks. We’d be sucking up to them. No, it’s not like that. I thought we’d do it on the 15th. The timing is bad. Nobody has money unless it’s the end of the month. I just asked Six Orange if they’d do it for that price. I can’t go that low. Look, there’s no student discount here. We’ll make up the difference in sales. We’ve sold most of the tickets. Now, we’ll do it as soon as we collect the money. We’ve never paid for the ballroom in advance before. Always after. Let’s try another place. The date’s decided, we can’t change now. You have the money: give him half upfront. But… It doesn’t matter; we have to pay one way or another. You were the one who proposed that we hold out for paying after the event. This guy isn’t going to bite. Katsumi! Where are you two going? Dance practice. And to the movies. Wanna come? No, thank you. These two young ladies just invited us to join them. I have to go back to the dorm. I have work to do. It can wait. Almost everything is done. Everybody’s waiting. Fine, then I’m going to give up on this dance party. Why? I wasn’t all that excited about it from the start. I can’t pretend anymore. You can handle it by yourself. Hello, is this Deputy Inspector Hanazawa of the Shinagawa Police Office? I’m Kurosawa from U University. Officer Doi gave me your number. I’d like to see you now if possible. A little French on the ticket really makes it snazzy. The French really seems to have goosed sales for some reason. Can you sell another 20 tickets to S University? This stinks; we ain’t got paid on some of these tickets. Department M, 40 tickets, Matsubara polytechnic, 80, L University, 50… I’m going to see the coppers; you can come if you’re done counting your sales. I already have 20 ticket sales to the polytechnic, so I’ll go too. - We’ll go. - Good luck. I envy you: you never have to work. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. I think it would be nice to be a responsible student… who’s too busy to nurse a social life. But that’s not how it is. See you later. Hello. Where’s Ryoji? You just missed them. Scotch & soda. Aren’t you working with them anymore? - Did Ryoji say something? - Nope. Please come in. Mori, coffee, please. - Look what the cat dragged in! - I’ve been around. You’re still the same. I’m not like Ryoji. I’m not going to sell out so easily. Ryoji believes that he’s changed. Nightmares have to end, sooner or later. But you’re living in a dream, too. It’s depressing to watch. Take a good look in the mirror! You’re poison with women. You’re the one who wrote that letter to my dad! - What are you talking about?! - Don’t play dumb! That honey that you were too scared to talk to, Akiko… She’s sweet on me. But don’t worry: I dumped her. She’s uptight like you, but she likes to do things that you can’t. - She likes to have fun with men! - Shut up! - Cool it. - Give her a try. See what you can do. I’m happy to see you finally show an interest. I’m not going to do anything so stupid. It’ll make you feel better. It’s like smashing a mirror to blow off steam. Katsumi, give it a rest. What’s the fuss? I’m not the one trying to start a fight. Dr. Furukawa’s office? My husband is vomiting blood, please come quickly. He collapsed right before he left for work. His ulcer is quite severe. I told him a million times to see a doctor. He wouldn’t listen. He said he was fine. His body is very weak. I imagine he’s been sick for quite some time. And now he’s caught cold as well. It seems he was too sick to endure the cold. Still, it might turn out to be for the best. Let’s get him into the hospital. The capacity is 200 people. How many tickets did you sell? 1000. That’s mercenary. Even the cloakroom is full. The building could collapse. I imagine you’ll make a tidy profit. Around ¥80,000 after I pay the band. I sure hit pay dirt. - Are those squares out there cops? - Yeah. There are quite a few of them. I figured it would be crowded, so I got eight. How cautious. The take is for the research committee. I can’t let any hoodlums try to muscle in. I think Takeshima is here. Sure enough. And he’s with those goons from J University that we mixed it up with at the pool hall. Do you think they’d try anything here? Not that I’d mind. Don’t do anything stupid. - What are you talking about? - We don’t need any trouble. I get it. I’m heading home in 30 minutes with the money. It’s more prudent to pay everyone tomorrow. I want everything to run smoothly, and I don’t want any trouble from you. I see. Ryoji, this is the last of it! Excuse me! Have a drink. Please have one. So, are you making any money out of this? This isn’t the time, Katsumi. We just came to dance. We need to talk. I can’t do this because it’s my school. I can’t instigate anything, but I have a sweet deal for you. - What are you talking about? - The take for the party. Forget about it, there are 10 cops watching the place. I got a plan. OK, you pitch in and I’ll give you a 30% cut. It’s a deal. In 30 minutes, the money is being brought out. The car is a ’52 Pontiac. If you catch them at the gate that leads down the hill, it’ll be like fish in a barrel. Are you playing me straight? Don’t trust me if you like. You’ll get Y30,000 easy. - OK, a ’52 Pontiac. - Where can I find you afterward? Do you know The Caribbean in Ginza? Ryoji, you jerk! Where are you off to? What was that for?! THE CARIBBEAN BAR Please come in. - Is Takeshima from J University here? - Takeshima? Oh, you mean Yama’s nephew. He’s out back in the garden. I see you made it. With a name like The Caribbean, I figured it would be fancy and with girls. Instead, you’re moping around in this dump. The liquor’s cheap here. And I have an uncle that works here. Isn’t that swell? I wish we had a hangout like this. - Name your poison. Whisky? - What is it? - Nothing fancy. Seagram’s. Or gin. - I’ll have the Seagram’s. The job couldn’t have gone smoother. I don’t like it when things get messy. Still, that was like taking candy from a baby. He handed over ¥30,000 without batting an eye. Is he a milquetoast or something? - Don’t ask. - Why? You don’t want to hear about Ryoji. Oh, so that’s Ryoji? When we rumbled at the pool hall, I took him for a fighter. He changed. 30% of ¥30,000… is ¥9,000. - I don’t want it. - Huh? - I don’t want it. Give it all back. - What? - Just give all ¥30,000 back. - What?! I thought this was funny from the start. You and Ryoji were just having a go at us from the start. - This has nothing to do with Ryoji! - Pipe down! You’ll scare away the customers next door. I was only being polite because I thought you were helping us to earn. But now that we’re on even footing, I’ve got a few choice words for you. Do you know many how many people you’ve hurt? I never thought Ryoji would just hand over the money. Since he lost his nerve, I thought I would smash his face to knock some sense into him. I’ll throw the money in his face and never talk to him again. Isn’t that a little stupid? Shut up, a dope like you wouldn’t understand! Asao, no! Shimada, let’s calm down and have a drink. You’re a little excited. Stabbing your friends in the back will do that. I’m not a backstabber! Did you really think that we would just give you the money? I’ll get it from you. Oh, we’ll pay you back all right… We’ll give it to you! There’s a small light by the door! - We have to get him under control! - Damn you! If they notice at The Caribbean, there’ll be hell to pay! - Block the door! - Tie him up! I can’t see! Shut up! Now can you see?! You son of a…! Are those duds your Sunday best? Better make sure it doesn’t stain! Is that all you’ve got?! You can’t beat a man, even when he’s tied to a chair! What does it take to shut this idiot up? What does he think he’s going to do to us? Naito, go get Tezuka and Yamakichi! - It would be quicker to phone. - If they’re not at The Moon, find them. They have a personal interest in making this mug suffer. Shimada, you’re gonna get paid back in spades! You’re all yellow! You’re a bunch of charlatans. - What you’re doing is dirty! - I think you’re the dirty one. What are you looking at? We’re right here. The arrogance! Who’s there?! Let me in, I’m here to get some liquor. You’re still here? Why don’t you go home already? You’re not going to drink this, are you? I'm counting the bottles, you know. - Drink up. - I can’t do it unless I’m drunk. He won’t die easily. Apologize! If you just apologize, I won’t have to hit you again! Is there a Fukuda in here? Ishikawa, you’re just in time! What’re you doing? We’re teaching him a lesson, but he’s a stubborn case. - Who’s the skirt? - My cousin. This is no place for a lady. Let’s go. - I’m staying. - Are you drunk? I have a score to settle. Why do you know him? If you have a score to settle, do it… Right now! Shimada. I knew it was you. I could tell by your voice. He can’t see. I tossed gin in his eyes. It stinks not being able to see… but I don’t care if want to settle your score. You want to hit me, don’t you? Hit me, if it makes you feel better. Who said anything about hitting you?! Then how are you going to settle your score? Do you want me to tell you that I love you? You haven’t killed him yet? Let me do it! What’s so funny? Stop laughing! Get off of me, you goofy broad! You said that you have a score to settle, but all you’re doing's weeping. - You louse… kicking a woman! - Let me do it! If you step hard like that, his neck will snap. Is he dead? We shouldn’t have done it! Get up, Katsumi! Hey, Ryosuke! I can’t believe it. Apologize to Akiko. We’ll let you go. Stop it, he’d rather die than apologize! But we’re going to try! We’ll work him over again. This is no place for a woman! Ishikawa, get her out of here! Katsumi, please apologize! I’m begging you! Apologize? For what? To who and for what? No! Dammit! I got a knife, I’ll do it. Don’t you have the guts? Let’s let him live. Stabbing a man isn’t right. Thanks for the sage advice! Cowards! Let’s go home. I’ll do it! No, I’ll do it! Damn! You’re a pretty indecisive lot! You’re a bunch of zeros. At least you’ve finally stumbled onto the fact... that you don’t have the nerve to do it. You asked me if I was stupid, but do you have the courage to do what you want! I did… In everything I did. I’m actually quite dedicated. If you want to stab me, then do it! I hope you’re not holding back on account of the lady. All women think about is love. It’s creepy. Akiko! She stabbed him! It was your fault! It was all your fault! Why did you laugh?! In front of everyone! I love you! I love you! It was humiliating! You imbeciles! The knife hit my belt! I don’t need you, Akiko. Everything you said was hogwash! I’m not like Yoshimura! I’m not like Ryoji! It hurts. Dammit! This won’t kill me! I do what I want! That’s the only way to get what I want! I know… that much! I’m the only one who… understands! The pain! The pain! Dammit! I won’t die! The pain… English translation by scannon Timing by lordretsudo THE END
