So who are you? Hey, we got your alert. Where's... That's not Caitlin. Uh... What's... what's happening here? - Actually, it's kind of a long and very confusing story. - One which we are happy to share. - First, please meet... - You can call me Snow. - Wait, as in, like, the third Snow sister? - Barry, do you remember the time that you found out Caitlin was trying to bring back Frost, and you destroyed her lab? I didn't have a choice. The point is, Caitlin never gave up. She kept on working with me. Together, we built a machine to reactivate Frost's mind in Caitlin's body. - Only... - Something went wrong. But in place of Caitlin... I came out instead. - Well, if you're not Caitlin or Frost, who are you? Honestly, I don't know. I wanna find out who I am just as much as the rest of you do. - Snow here is a total blank slate with zero memories. So I've been doing my best to bring her up to speed. - Mark, what happened to Caitlin? Where is she? Caitlin's dead, Barry. - What? - That's impossible. - I... I... I know what you must be thinking, but I have a plan to bring Caitlin back. Now the CRC was supposed to unzip neural DNA from Caitlin. That way, we could isolate Frost's brain patterns - inside of her... - Download into another new body later on. Only a power fluctuation caused the process to malfunction, and so if Team Flash could provide me with a stable energy source, we could reverse the process and just bring Caitlin back. So now you want our help? For Caitlin's sake, yeah. - It's Caitlin. We have to try. Yeah, I'm sold. What do we have to lose? Okay. Let's get to work. How did I do? Are you kidding? You were perfect. This is going better than we planned. What? This is what Caitlin wanted. And when we're done, Frost will be back. - I can't believe this is really happening. I mean, this is nuts. Yeah, I know, right? Especially with, uh, you know, everything else that's happened lately. Allegra, look, about what happened, - I just want you to know... - I think we should focus on Caitlin first... and then, you know, when this is all done... Uh, yeah, yeah, totally. - I get it. - Yeah. Right. Okay. What a day. I still can't believe it. So Caitlin's gone? I know. It's too much... All of it. Babe, you okay? - Mm-mm. - When Barry called, he said Mark has a plan to get Caitlin back. - Joe, that is not even close to our only problem. - I think we should leave Central City. Cecile, the reason I said we should leave is because I'm worried that the stronger your new abilities become, the more it puts you on the front line. - Come on... - God knows you can handle anything, but I'm still worried about who or what is coming after the woman I love and the mother of my child. This family can't... It can't handle losing you. Okay. Look. Babe, I get it. I do. But what you're asking me, how am I supposed to... choose between our family and the greater good of the entire city? How am I supposed to do that? What am I supposed to do? What are we supposed to do? I don't know. I really wanted to see Old Faithful. - We can go to Yellowstone anytime. Right now, it's more important we stay here to help Mark. Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Barry... Barry, please. Are you? - If Mark's plan doesn't work... It has to. ♪ I, I, I, I ♪ I feel like ♪ I feel like dancing Oh! Buy you a drink, handsome? One of us is still working. Oh, wow. I'll be sure to leave that Employee of the Month badge on your side of the bed tonight. Good to close up? I could get Ashanti to do it. - Ah, nah... gotta earn my keep. I hear the boss is a real jerk. Oh, yeah? - See you at home. - Okay. ♪ I feel like dancing Good night. Um, if you're looking for a gig, amateur night's tomorrow. I'm no amateur, Hartley, and I already have a gig... you. Aw, come on out, Hartley. I promise to make it quick. All you have to do is listen to the music. Mm. - Who are you, and what the hell do you want? You can call me The Fiddler, and I'm here to ruin your night. Why are you doing this? You have something I need. Hartley! Hartley. Tell your boss I'll be back. Hartley! It's okay. Just remember you're doing the right thing. I sure hope so. - All right. Snow's ready. Excuse me. - I never really got to know her. - Well, we know she's brave as hell. How long will this take? Oh, as long as it needs to. Hold on. The neural conductivity readouts are surging. Mark, we got tachyon feedback. Mm-hmm. - Hold on. Something's not right here. What the hell are you doing? Trying to save her life! - You can't interrupt this process! You have to get her back inside right now! - Mark! Chester, what happened? - I don't know. All I did was provide a stable power source. That wouldn't cause this. - He didn't say this would hurt. He just said it would bring them back. Them? You mean Caitlin? No. She means Caitlin and Frost. Mark, everything you've done has been for Frost, hasn't it? That's why you haven't mentioned her. This wasn't about Caitlin. This was about bringing Frost back, wasn't it? Mark, wasn't it? Cai... Caitlin wasn't supposed to come back alone, Barry. They both were. God... - Trying to bring them both back, that must've caused the malfunction. It's the only thing that makes sense. Why did you lie to us? - 'Cause I can't trust any of you... you most of all, Barry. That's why we had to build the CRC in secret in the first place, because Caitlin knew that you would try to stop her again. Mark, man, this... this isn't right. I'm sorry, Team Flash. Just because you all gave up on Frost doesn't mean that I can. I never will. Is that Mark? No, it's an intruder alert. The med lab's been breached. Stay here. - Hartley? - Where's Caitlin? - I need a doctor. - She's away. - Soundwaves... short-circuiting my heart's natural rhythm, How do I... I mean... Use the sonic cuff. - Sonic? - The bottom drawer! Bottom drawer! There. Are you good? - You okay? - Took you long enough, Allen. - I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't know... You said the bottom drawer. It was in the top drawer. I didn't even know what you... - Never mind. Let me rest. Oh, gosh. This arrythmia isn't going away anytime soon. Cuff's a patch, not a cure. - Okay. - Hartley? - It's Hartley, yeah. It's... How did you get in here, and what happened to you? - One, I used to work here... - Great. And two, some musical psycho attacked me with her murder violin... Calls herself The Fiddler. Is this who attacked you? Her name is Izzy Bowen, only we were friends the last time we met. - Oh, well, no need to unfriend Izzy on my account. It's not her. - Barry, that's two new Rogues in two days, and now Mark is lying to us too. Trouble in paradise? - Please. - Don't worry about it. I'll handle Mark. Bored. Sleeping now. Your upgrade didn't work. Don't get me wrong. I love the fiddle and all. You failed me. This is the price. Failing is not an option. Now bring me what I want, or next time, you die. Am I clear? Yes, very. I'm sorry. Another round. You know what? Just make it the whole bottle. - It still won't bring her back. I just wanna talk. You're wasting your time. - And you screwed up, Mark... Badly. Yeah. I know why you did it. Okay. No, go ahead. Enlighten me. Because you loved Frost with all your heart. You still do. Sometimes, when we love someone like that, we do the wrong things for the right reasons. I know I have. Please. Are you saying you're not mad at me anymore? No, I am, but I understand why you lied. But there's something you need to understand now too: how we operate. You are a part of this team now, and that means we have your back, but you need to have ours, which also means no more going rogue. Mark... If you let us in, we work together, we can do the impossible. But we have to stick together. We have to go right now. - Go where? - Right now. - Where? - Come on. - Is this, like, one of those team things? What do you mean this was never gonna work? - I ran a full diagnostic on the CRC, trying to figure out what went wrong, and what I found was, neural DNA could never unlock Frost's consciousness. We need endogenous neural imprints to make this work. Okay? But you're talking about a literal map of Caitlin's mind. Where are we gonna find something like that? Thomas Snow. Caitlin's dad? He's dead. No, Iris is right. Thomas Snow attached Frost's consciousness to Caitlin when she was a child. - Caitlin downloaded everything she could find from his digital files at her apartment, said that the hard copies and all the rest are in storage at Tannhauser Labs. Now, it's a lot, but... Meet me at Caitlin's. I'll check in with Carla at Tannhauser. Chester, you and Mark get to work on the CRC. Once we find what we're looking for, we're gonna bring back Caitlin and Frost. - I entered the harmonics already. Now, come on. I know this. Ow. Frak. Damn it. Why aren't you working? Are you okay? - Well, you're obviously the other Snow sister. Actually, I'm kind of busy, if you don't mind. What are you working on? - My sonic gauntlets... Why do you care? - Oh, I don't... About your gauntlets. You just seemed like you were in pain. What's wrong? - I have a dangerously erratic heart rate due to some punk witch who caught me with my guard down. But that won't be a problem next time, because I'm boosting my gauntlet's efficiency by 400%. Wow. Why? - You know, actually, it doesn't matter. If you could just, please, go away or something... Okay, I'm gonna make this easy. Do you have any of Caitlin Snow's medical knowledge? - No. - No, okay, um, can you shoot ice from your hands or eyes? Either is acceptable. - No. - No... then you can't help me, and therefore, you are useless! So please leave me alo... - You shouldn't be working right now or angrily asking people weird questions. It's disturbing. I have to finish this. - Are you scared that person will find you? Because I'm sure Barry and the others have... - I have to get out of here, okay? If I don't... - You're not afraid of getting hurt. You're afraid of someone else getting hurt. You think they're in danger. And that is why I have to finish these: so I can keep him safe... The only way that I can. - You're going to kill the punk witch? Oh, no. Killing is wrong. - And Central City has more meta-violence per capita than any other city in the world. - You're not a killer. I can tell. You don't know me. - Actually... and I can say this quite truthfully... I think I know you better than I know myself. - I used to be a meta-criminal, a Rogue, as they say. I used to hurt people all the time, and I enjoyed it. What changed you? Oh, Roderick, okay? Roderick. You changed to keep him safe? That's beautiful. But that's not real change, is it? Deciding to change for the person you love doesn't mean you've decided who you wanna be. That's a choice you still have to make for yourself, isn't it? Please tell me you found something. We have to get Caitlin and Frost back. We can't. Is this really true? I read it a dozen times. In his original experiment, Thomas Snow tried to create a Caitlin 2.0, one that would be immune to ALS, but instead, he created a daughter with two mixed consciousnesses, and when he tried to reverse it, he found out the process would kill one of them. - That's why Thomas never built his own CRC, because he loved both Caitlin and Frost. He couldn't bear to lose either of them. Just like us. - Barry, if Snow goes into that machine, and only Caitlin or Frost can come back... We're gonna have to choose who to bring back. - You know, the last thing Caitlin said to me was that she'd never stop trying to bring back Frost. We need to honor her by honoring her plan. Mark, we're all pretty clear on your opinion. I wanna hear everybody else's. Okay. I vote to bring back Frost. Mark's right. Caitlin chose for us. This was her plan, so choosing Frost honors her. Right, Chuck? Chuck? Um, sorry, but, uh, but no. Allegra, look, when Deathstorm brought my dad back, it taught me one thing: that resurrecting the dead is unnatural. Now, I don't wanna choose, but if I have to, I'd choose Caitlin, 'cause when I run through the science, it's what makes the most sense to me. Mm, it's two to one. Let me guess: you're with Chester, right? That way, your super-hubby can tip the scales to Caitlin. Uh, no, I choose Frost. I have my reasons, but that's how I feel. Well, it's three to one. - I just need more time to think about it. - Well, think about it all you want, boss man, but in eight hours, I'm doing this, with or without you, and if you try to stop me, you'll have no one but yourself to blame for the fallout. He can blame me. You all are a family. Now you're being torn apart, and it's all my fault? I wish I'd never been born. Worst day ever. Snow is wrong. It's not her fault. It's mine. The last thing I said to Caitlin before I destroyed her lab was, "I'm sorry." The truth is, I wasn't. - Barry, the reason that I chose Frost was because I didn't choose her the first time, when I had the chance. That's why I chose to bring Frost back: because I didn't choose her when she was alive. What is it? The moment Caitlin stepped into the CRC, she made her own choice about what she wanted, who she wanted to be. - Mm-hmm. And what if we've been thinking about this all wrong? I know what we need to do. Hello. It's, uh, Snow, right? Cecile, meta-human attorney and meta-human superhero. Mark told me all about you. You enjoying the weather? I love the rain. I love all of nature. It just... it makes me feel so at peace. Yeah, I can see that. - It's because everything in nature has a purpose... just like you. You have a purpose. You help people. I just... I wish I knew what my purpose was. It's strange. Right now, I feel so connected to all living things, and yet so disconnected and alone. - Do you know that you're the first person whose feelings I can't read? Usually, ooh, that is something I'd be worried about, but I don't know. Not this time. Somehow, you just seem like a friend. Then let's be. Friends. Was that funny? Am I a funny person? That would be nice. You are very genuine, and that is rare. Thanks. - So I heard about what the rest of the team was voting on. I gotta tell ya. I honestly don't know how I would've voted, had I been there, or Joe. So... I'm gonna ask you a question that I usually don't have to. How are you feeling right now? - Even though my entire existence is a mystery, one, whoever I am, I like myself, and two... I don't wanna go back inside that metal box. And now I'm afraid of the decision the team will make. - You should make the decision for yourself. - Really? - Yeah. We looked at Thomas' original files on Frost and Snow. When Frost was created, Thomas didn't try to decide who his daughter should be. He took a step back, and he let 'em figure it out. So using the CRC and choosing who you should be, that's not our choice to make. Only you can decide who you're gonna be. Oh. - Ooh, okay, this is what we're doing. Okay, my turn. Oh, hi! So you've made a decision? Not even, but whatever decision I make, it'll be mine... all mine. What is it? - It was a massive sonic attack downtown. It looks like our Fiddler friend is back and ready to rumble. - Wait, that's Hartley's Krakatoa Club. He's gone after The Fiddler. - If he's still hurt, why didn't he ask for help? He doesn't want your help. He finally made his choice. Does it look like I'm playing? For the last time, where is Hartley Rathaway? - Please... - Let him go. Hartley. I knew, if I put the squeeze on your squeeze, you'd show up sooner or later. Just in time, too, 'cause I was starting to get bored of torturing your employees. She killed them all... the whole crew. Did I mention that there are fates worse than death? No! It's over, Fiddler. You're powerless and outnumbered. Oh, Flash. You came to my show. See, instruments are just a tool. A real artist uses what's inside them. Time to get what I came for. How do you like my upgrade? - Don't. Stop. Snow told me what you said. You don't have to do this. You can still choose another way. It's too late. Roderick is dead because of her. I have nothing to live for now. Yes, you do. I'll show you. The Fiddler didn't kill them. They're trapped in a vibrational phase. But they need your gauntlets to get them out. You made the right choice. - And reset things in the process. Hey. - You saved a lot of lives today. What do you wanna do with The Fiddler? You figure it out. I'm busy. Aw, look at him, wandering around like a lost puppy. You all right there? - No. We got what we came for. Now let's get the hell out of here. It was Mercer. He took The Fiddler. And my gauntlets. Her name is Andrea Wozzeck. Turns out she's also working with Owen Mercer. Why is anyone's guess. - Supervillain team-up, great. So do we know why they want Hartley's gauntlet? - Do we care? - Uh... - Look, the only thing that I'm concerned about right now is, "What did you decide?" I didn't decide anything. Snow did. She already told everybody else. I guess now it's time she tells you too. What is... - I know that this has been difficult for you, and that whatever decision I make will affect you a lot, but not as much as it will affect me. This is my fate, my future, my life. I'm not going back inside the CRC. What? I'm gonna choose my own path and be my own person, whoever that ends up being. That's it? What, I'm just supposed to forget about Frost - and accept this? - Yes, because I didn't choose this. Caitlin did when she created a person with feelings and free will, and I won't give that up to become someone I'm not. - Please, you don't even have your own name. Actually, I do. I found out today that my father always dreamed of creating something or someone new, and he called her Khione. But science is like nature. It can be cruel as well as beautiful. Either way, we can't control it. So I know Caitlin and Frost are gone, and we can mourn the flowers that have fallen from the vine, but we can't ask a new bloom to give up its place in exchange. I hope you can accept that. I hope you can accept me, 'cause I'd like to live and grow with all of you. We want that too. - You need to get inside right now, okay? That was always the plan. That was our plan. That was Caitlin's plan! Plans change. No! Do you realize what you've just done? Yeah. I just helped a new friend. - The next time that I see you, I am taking you down. Mark... Looks like you're back to 100%. It stopped raining. Is Mark gonna be okay? I hope so. Well, the sun is shining, and we made it through the week. Mm, and in one piece at that. - Mm-hmm. - And even though it's hard to believe that we'll never see Caitlin or Frost again, I am happy for Khione. Yeah, I know what you mean. That's why I keep telling myself that Frost chose to become Hellfrost and fight Deathstorm, just like Caitlin chose to go into the CRC, and now Khione's made her choice too. Yeah. Is it crazy to think that this new version of Caitlin is what she would've wanted all along? No, not at all. I think she'd like her. So? Mm? Got any weekend plans? Actually, I was thinking we could take in a geyser. - ♪ Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out, waitin' ♪ ♪ Waitin' for some lover to come ♪ ♪ Dialed about a thousand numbers ♪ You are a great dancer!
