[sultry jazz music] [man laughs] - [Man] One more pop for daddio. - [Man] No, no, why draw attention? He's dead anyway. Let's go. [ominous music] [man laughing] [gun firing] [intense music] [dog sniffing] [somber music] [dog barking] [dog barking] - Ah shit! - He's alive! - Where's my son? Where's Danny? - Where you doing? We can't just leave him. - [Man] The fuck do I look like, a doctor? - Where's my son? - [Man] Hang on, I'm calling an ambulance. I'm calling an ambulance. - Where's my son? - [Announcer] Paging Dr. Pryce, Dr. Pryce to cardiology please. Dr. Pryce to cardiology. - Morning sir. - Morning. - [Man] What do we got? - Victim's alive, Alan White, 50, Caucasian. He was brought here an hour ago. He's been shot several times, but his condition's stable for now. Follow me, I wanna show you something. We found this along with eight dead bodies littering a farmyard on the outskirts of the west side. - My name is Robert Williams and I'm going to die here tonight. - You know this Robert Williams? - Williams? Not that guy who owns all the auto malls along the I-90. - He's sort of a recluse, right? - Yeah except this ain't him. This is our shooting victim, Alan White. Two kids found him earlier this morning. - All right. So what does the real Williams have to say about this? - We don't know, he's missing. Kidnapped last night. - My death should be a lesson to others like me. If you're watching this, this tape do whatever they tell you to do or you'll end up where I am now. - Sweet huh? It gets worse. - Ooh. - Jesus Christ. Victor Ryan? - He was one of the bodies we found in the farmyard. - Well it'll be a pleasure closing up that file. - Alan White here is our only link to what actually happened last night. This is big, gentlemen. I got politics to deal with. I want you to pay a visit to Mr. White, and get some answers, quickly. He doesn't look like he has much time. - Is my son here? - [Nurse] No, Alan. These are detectives Harris and Berkley. - You must find him. - [Harris] Look, we need to know what happened last night. - Was a long night. Was one hell of a night. - Then you'd better get on with it. - How's Emma? - [Nurse] She's fine, Alan. She had a good night. - Emma's your daughter? - Yes. She's very sick. She needs a heart transplant. Everything I did, I did for my daughter. It was all for nothing. - Then it's a terrible tragedy, but maybe you could give us an idea of what you're talking about. - Well, I'd just come home from seeing Emma. [door creaks] [pounding] [somber music] It was my son, Danny. - Hi Dad. Long time no see, Dad. Ah, I've been shot. - Jesus, Danny. Last night was the first night in seven, eight years I think that I saw him. - So he's shot, no place to go and he comes to you for shelter, is that it? - No, not shelter. He came to make a deal. Now I have to phone the hospital with... Could bleed to death. - Put the phone down. Put the fuckin' phone down! [gun cocks] - Jesus! Danny. - Shh. I'm on borrowed time here. So let's get started. I got a family to protect. - You've got a family now? - Yeah, right now they're in danger. [clock ticking] - Who shot you? - Man called Frayerling. He's my business partner. We'll come back to that. I have something that you need. You help me, I help Emma. Emma's dying, right? I read about it in the papers. Still no donors. Very sad. - Take that smirk off your face. If you're going to have a go at Emma's condition then you can fuck off out of here right now! - Pay attention! I've been shot. I can't go to no hospital, and that makes me a fuckin' dead man. But we know that my heart is a perfect match for Emma. If I die, and she gets my heart, then she lives. I'm Emma's last chance. You want my heart, you gotta earn it. - All right, all right. So what's the trouble? - I fucked with the wrong people. I'm part of what you call a crew. The other day, we got the contract on a kidnapping. The target was a mark called Robert Williams, rich guy. The man who set the kidnapping up was Mr. Ryan. He's the one that's gonna kill my family when he finds out what happened. - What happened? - Well it was me that got us involved. [upbeat music] [knocking] - You gonna get the door? - Ah, they weren't supposed to be here 'til noon. [pounding] Shit. Webster was state raised. By the age of 12, he got certified sociopath. What is the occasion? - Not guilty! - [Danny] Too many fires, dead house pets, that kinda thing. Yin Yang thinks he's the brains of the outfit. Never saw the point in ruining his fantasy. - Oh man! - Oh you fuckin' dope. - [Webster] Sorry. - [Danny] What's happening? Valentine is like a brother to me. - Cooling son? - [Danny] We started out together in New York, doing small jobs. - Morning. - [Woman] It's two o'clock. - I've known him the longest. - Okay, afternoon. - [Danny] We been through a lot together. - Got milk? - This is my good suit. Fuck. - We gotta talk. - Right. - That thing that we talked about before? We're in. It's on in a couple of days. I got a call from Mr. Ryan in fucking person. - Yeah, did Mr. Ryan say anything about me? - Yeah, he said bring the crappy suit wearing psychotic gay boy. [men laughing] - [Webster] I'm not gay! - He didn't mention any of us by name, but he knows who we are. Christ knows we've stolen enough cars for him. This is like a promotion. And this got brought over here last night. - Fuck me. Ho! Don't fart around. - Now I said that we'd meethim later today at the factory. Hellman is gonna be there. - Hellman? Fuck this D, I'm out. - You don't have to be scared of Hellman, we're on the same side. - Guys like Hellman don't have a side, and I'm scared of him. You think they send him in on the soft, easy jobs? - Well yeah, sometimes. - Bullshit, that man is evil. He has Satan's number on speed dial. - Well he's on this one, just to check up on us. Now I don't know about you guys, but I don't wanna be stealing cars for a living when I'm 30. End up like Puddle John, workingfor Mr. Ryan for 20 years and still being in charge of keeping the shine on his limo. 'Cause that is what happens if you fail this kinda test. Well we're at least gonna hear him out, right? I said we'd be there! - Yo Danny, I'm with ya. Besides, I wanna meet this fuckin' Hellman. - I'm going too. - You and I. - I'm in for it, Danny. I trust ya. - Come on, Valentine. I need you to be part of this. I can't do this without you, you know that. - Okay. - Yeah! - Let's go hear what they have to say. - That's it, we're going. - [Webster] Yeah! - [Danny] Put it away, come on, put it away. - [Alan] What about your wife? Does she come into this? You told me that you had a family. - You don't get it, do ya? Those guys are my family, and now they're all dead men unless you do what I say. - Go on, tell me. - [Danny] So we went to the factory. - Yeah, you better fuckin' be there. - Yo give me my phone back, man. - Yeah sure, sure. - Hope you didn't call Japan on my shit. - Fuck you. - Fuckin' yuppie. - Y'all know we don't have to do this, right? - Don't talk like that. This is us moving up. - Yo man, trust me man, this is gonna work out fine. [door creaks] - [Danny] The man's name was Lawrence. - So you're the new blood. - [Danny] Everybody says he's unkillable 'cause he's got that scar on his neck and he's not dead. I'm pretty sure he'd done time at Attica with Hellman. [ominous music] - What the fuck is this, a school trip? - [Danny] I never did find out that man's name. Doesn't matter now. Their leader is called Hellman. Don't know his first name, much too scared to ask. What I do know is if you want someone killed-- - They'll do just fine. - [Danny] He's the man you call. - I know Danny, the one with the tear drop tattoo, known him almost a year. - [Danny] Frayerling the fat man was the connection to Mr. Ryan. Guy looked like a moron with the stupid hat he was wearing. The dish in the corner's name was Lee. Official story was that she was Mr. Ryan's accountant, but I bet his books weren't the only thing that she straightened out for him. - Mr. Ryan wants them involved. - So that you know why you're here, the man who lives in thishouse, Robert Williams, is rich. Mr. Ryan does not like him. Mr. Ryan wants us to go in, get him, and you'll get your money. - I have a question, Benjamin Franklin. - [Hellman] Benjamin Franklin, very good. - How you plan on gettin' in? - Knock on the door? - [Valentine] We were given guns. - Oh right, well getting to the house is going to require waving them around a bit. - [Valentine] We're just gonna wave 'em around, right? - Right, you know, for show. - So we don't even need to load them? - No. Well, maybe, yeah. You know, in case of unforeseen circumstances. - Yeah, it's better to have a loaded gun and not need it than need one and not have one, right? - Now once we get into the house, we'll split up. Frayerling here used to work for this man. He knows what he looks like. He'll get him. - You don't even know what the fucking guy looks like? - No, best picture the fat man took was this. Annie Leibovitz he's not. - My fuckin' camera's a piece of shit, what am I supposed to do? - [Hellman] That's why he's coming with us, so he can ID him. - I'll take Danny with me in case he gives us a fight. - Right, and the rest of us have other tasks to complete. There's a safe. We find it, blow it up, take the money, extra added bonus for Mr. Ryan. - So boys, Mr. Ryan is offering you a job. Are you gonna take it or not? [suspenseful music] - Get scared? - I ain't scared of nobody. - Well, some people it's worth being afraid of, kid. You'll learn that. - Okay boys, go home, stay there. I'll call you. - [Danny] They called the very next day. - I don't think these motherfuckers are coming. - They're coming, all right? - You said that an hour ago. Remember, we're dealing with a bunch of idiots here. I wouldn't be surprised if they showed up in a yellow school bus. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means they're not coming, and we're gonna die out here from this cold. - Are you sure about the time, Danny? - I'm sure about the time, 12:30. - AM or PM? - Oh, very fucking funny. - I'm serious, man. If they're not coming 'til tomorrow man, I'mma take my black ass home and get some sleep. - Does this strike you as the sort of thing that you would do in the afternoon? - Who gives a fuck what time you would do some shit, man? Let's just do it and get it over with. Now are you right about this time? - I'm right about the time. 12:30. - Friday or Saturday? - They didn't say what fuckin' day, they said 12:30 and then they hung up. - Hey didn't the clocks just get set back recently? - That was a month ago. - You set yours back, man? - I swear I'm gonna shoot you in a minute. They're coming, told ya. - Ain't cut for size. Everything looks the same. You got your guns, are they loaded? - We're not gonna need 'em. [Hellman laughs] - [Man] Blood's gonna be spilt. - [Yin Yang] That's not what you said. - Shooting people wasn't part of the deal. - You don't have a deal. - I can't do this. I don't wanna be down. - Okay, go on, get outta here. I know what you're thinkin', and you're right. I might shoot ya in the back. Look, you're coming with me now, dead or alive. And it wouldn't be the same without you. All right, let's go. Danny, you go with Frayerling. We'll see you at the gate. [suspenseful music] - [Frayerling] Hey kid. - What's my part in this? - You ain't gonna like it. - Danny, just tell me. - [Frayerling] Stay down. - [Man] Frayerling, what are you doing here? - Good evening, gentlemen. I got a call from the man. Come on, let's go. I'm tired! - It's too late. - For Christ's sakes you guys. You know me! [gate creaks] [gun firing] [ominous music] [tires squeal] [guns cocking] - [Hellman] Move it, now! - [Man] Stay down. - Mr. Ryan is not paying you to stand on your knees. Now let's go. [somber vocal music] [guns firing] - [Man] Come on, get up kid! - [Man] Start shooting, now or I shoot you. [guns firing] - Come on you fucks! Ah! It fuckin' cut off my fuckin' finger! - Shut the fuck up! - Cover me bro, cover me! - No! [guns firing] [intense music] - Fuck! - Wait! [guns firing] [man grunts] No! [ominous music] [Yin Yang panting] - We'll get you outta here. I promise. - Sometime today, gentlemen? [door slams] [intense music] [gun fires] [woman screaming] [suspenseful music] - Where is he? - He's in here, kid. [woman shrieks] - What do you want? - You're coming with us. [woman screams] - Shut up and stay still, lady! You'll get a call telling you when and where to deliver the ransom. Then you'll get your husband back. Careful with that! [woman groaning] [explosion booms] What the fuck? - It's fine, they're just blowing the safe is all. Let's go, we got our own job to do. - So we're leading Mr. Williams out the door, and I got the sick feeling, Webster's dead. Yin Yang, maybe he's dying and it's all my fault. I fucked everything up. And then there was this thumpingand banging from the trunk, and that's when things got really fucked up. [pounding] - Give me your keys. - What if he's got loose? - Give me the fuckin' keys. - What if he got loose? - You got a fuckin' gun right? [pounding] Ah Christ. You stupid, fat fuck. Oh god, oh god. Get that fuckin' tape off him man. Get it off! - Back off! - Get it off him! Get it off him! Get it off. Fucking fat fuck! Oh Christ! He died on us. Ah Christ! [somber music] We are fucking dead men. You just killed us. - Fuck I'm fucking done! - You stupid fat fuck! Shut up! Stop fucking shit up! [gun fires] Ah Christ! - Hey Danny. [gun fires] [Danny groaning] [gun firing] - [Danny] Frayerling was the only one that knew what he looked like. - You want me to take this man's place? - That's the deal. I'm sorry. You go through with this, and Emma can have my heart. - What happens when they have to return me to this man's family? - That was never part of the plan. We get the ransom, we kill Williams. That's the way Mr. Ryan wants it. - If you're going to kill Williams, then why not take the body and explain what happened? - Ryan wants Williams alive. He wants him to do something for him. - What? - He wants him to make a video. - [Alan] What? - A deathbed testimonial. A warning to anyone he wants to put the fear of God into. - Yes, but surely if anybody sees the tape, then they'll know that I'm not Williams. - That doesn't matter. By then you'll be dead, but my family will be safe. Ryan's people have gotta believe that everything's going to plan. Frayerling's missing, but I think I can explain that. They gotta believe thateverything's run like clockwork, or they're gonna kill us all. In the morning, they'll let us go. - I have to die in this man's place? I can't trust you. - Just ask yourself, can you live with it if you don't do this? Are you strong enough to go back to the hospital and watch Emma slip away? Because now, at the back of your mind, you'll always know that you chose to save yourself. I know it's a big risk, but it's the only shot she's gonna get. Are you gonna take that away from her? Can you live with that? If you say no, then my options are up. I'll pull the trigger. - I have no choice do I? You know I'd do anything for your sister. - If there was any other way-- - Save it. Probably lying anyway. - We got work to do. - [Detective] You agreed to this? - What else could I do? Emma's illness is the worstthing that ever happened to me. I already failed Danny as a father, and didn't want to do the same to Emma. This was the only way I could live with myself. - [Detective] Can we just get on with this? - [Alan] Danny had it all planned. - You gotta put these on. - What for? - I told you, Lawrence saw Frayerling and me dragging him to the door. They didn't see his face, but they saw what he was wearing. Now you put these on. - I'd really rather not. - [Danny] Come on, back inside. - Where are you going? Let me ask you a question, Danny. I have to have an answer. What ever happened to your mother? - In 10 years, haven't you once had an urge to look in the phone book? It's funny, you know I knew exactly where you lived before tonight. Well, she died. Truth is she stopped livin' the second you took herdaughter without an explanation. Come on, get changed. [intense music] Yeah. He's in. Come on, we're late. - Here I am wearing a dead man's clothes. - You are a dead man. We both are. Everybody dies. - Not Emma. You and I die. She gets her chance. [dramatic music] - Right. Time to get you ready. - Listen Danny, I'm really sorry for what happened. If I could turn the clocks back, then I would. - You can't. - I might not get another chance to put this straight. - Oh shut up. In a few hours, you can tell me in heaven. [dramatic music] - Where ya been? Where's Frayerling? - I told you, inside. - [Young] Keys. - [Alan] The man's name was Young. He was hired to collect Mr. Ryan's share of the money stolen from the safe. He seemed pissed about something. [suspenseful music] - Hello, Mr. Williams. - They killed Yin Yang. - He was dead already. Get over it. [man chuckles] Where's the fat man? - I shot him. The fucker pulled a gun on me, trying to take Williams-- - Don't you lie to me. - I swear. He waits 'til we're in some country lane, starts saying some bullshit about a flat. I know there's something wrong. We pull over, and he pulls a fucking gun on me. Says he ain't gonna shoot me 'cause he likes me, but he wants to keep the ransom for himself. I'm like yeah, sure, right, whatever. I'm standing there. [gun fires] That's all she wrote. [ominous music] I mean I'm fucking tired. I don't want to do all that walking. - Even Frayerling wouldn't be dumb enough to cross Mr. Ryan. - Oh and I would, right? I made all this shit up to get in with you? Please. - Mr. Ryan's not gonna be happy about this. He liked that porky bastard. You know you think you know somebody, you never do. Oh shoot. [percussive music] - [Lee] Guess why I'm here. - Brought those little sandwiches. [man chuckles] - Mr. Ryan said if I don't get a good explanation, none of you get to see the weekend, his words, not mine. - I can explain. - Be quiet. - Kid here says he killed Frayerling. Says the fat man tried to get off with Mr. Williams here. I believe him. We still got Mr. Williams. - We ain't fucked that up yet. - You better give me an explanation as to why Mr. Ryan won't be collecting his share of the safe money. - Right. - Inside, I'm cold. [eerie music] - [Alan] She knew. - Do you have to do that? - Shouldn't have been any amateurs on this job. - Mr. Ryan's decision. New blood gets spilled, it doesn't matter so much. No offense. Now I came for an explanation, so explain. - Right. - Do you know who planned this job? I did, and it took me three months so I want an explanation just as much as Mr. Ryan. [gun fires] - We followed your plan. Frayerling and the kid went for Williams. Lawrence and I did the safe. [intense music] It was a really good idea to put Lawrence in charge of the explosives. [explosion booms] It was a fucking mess. - Uh fellas? This shit is empty. - The safe was supposed to be loaded. - Well it wasn't. It was empty. Look, Mr. Ryan knows I wouldn't cross him. I've seen him do things, things even I wouldn't do. Now there's not a lot of people I wouldn't fuck over, but Mr. Ryan is one of them. - Well you better hope that he believes you. - Mr. Williams, there is something I'd like you to do for me. [Alan shouts] Now, I'd like to be civilized about this, and I don't wanna make a mess. So I'm going to ask you politely, once, to do this for me. - You're gonna kill me, aren't you? - And I thought rich people were stupid. - Why should I do what you want me to? - Oh well because Mr. Williams, there's dying and then there's dying. And the death I have planned for you is painless. Take a second. But, plans can change. - What do you want me to do? - We're gonna make a video. A memento of this occasion. What I need you to do is just read this card for me, and don't get me in the shot this time, you fucking idiot. - All right, go. - My name is Robert Williams and I'm going to die here tonight. My death should be a lesson to others like me. If you're watching this tape, then it's a warning. Do whatever they tell you to do, or you'll end up where I am now. My name is Robert Williams, and my death is a warning to all of you. - Thank you, Mr. Williams. You know, from what I heard about you, I thought you'd cry like a baby. - You heard wrong. Not like that. - In a couple of hours, I'm gonna get a call to say they picked up their ransom. For all of your sakes you better hope that his wife comes up with the cash. 'Cause if Mr. Ryan hears any more bad news, you're all fucked. - Mr. Ryan will get his ransom, and we'll take care of Mr. Williams here. Hopefully we'll be able to salvage part of this mess. - I say we do it now. - What if his wife wants to talk to him? - While we're waiting for that phone call, why don't we get some sleep? Take Williams and the boys upstairs. The rest of you find beds down here. - That's a good idea. Hey boys, you want me to read you a bedtime story? - Fuck you. - Well if it'll help you sleep. [man laughs] - Come on. [man grunts] - [Alan] It was so weird, but at this point I really did want to sleep. I was so tired. As it turned out, I didn't get any sleep at all. [door creaks] - Yo D, I can't take this shit no more, man. Let's get the fuck outta here, come on. - Come back. - Get off me D! - Come back. - Get the fuck off me man! What's wrong? - We can't go, Valentine. We can't run. - That's the only way we're gonna survive. You didn't see what these motherfuckers did to Yin Yang. - Hey. Look at this. He's still alive. - No, wait! [Valentine screams] [gun fires] We're in over our heads, D. [Danny groans] What the fuck happened to you? - Frayerling shot me. If Hellman finds out, then I'll end up next to Yin Yang. - That's why we gotta get the fuck outta here. These people are psychos, andwe don't belong with them man. They don't give a fuck. - You think I wanna be here? I came back here for you. If we run now, then Mr. Ryan will find us. We won't last a fucking day,Valentine, not a fucking day. - What the fuck are we gonna do? - I came here for you. And I know you don't know what's going on, but if you follow my lead, I can get us outta this. Okay? Okay? Come on. Come on. [somber music] - I know. I know he's not Williams. Part of planning the kidnapping meant getting to know Mr. Williams very well. And he is not Mr. Williams. - [Danny] Why didn't you tell the others? - No offense, but you don't have the balls or the brains to pull a switch on Mr. Ryan all by yourself. Double crossing is my specialty, and I am dying to know how this one works out. - [Danny] If I don't tell you? - Then I'll wake up Hellman and I'll get him to do the asking. He's so much better at it than I am. Either way you'll tell me. How many fingers you end up with is up to you. - First you let Valentine go back to bed. He don't know nothing about this. I wanna keep it that way. Go on, it's okay. I'll straighten this out. The less you know, the better. How do I know what I tell you stays in this room? You work for Mr. Ryan, right? You're loyal to him. - My loyalties are only to me. What Mr. Ryan doesn't know can't hurt us. Mr. Ryan is a very ruthless man, but he's not terribly clever. Look schoolboy, I got a bank account full of money that he never even knew was his. I ripped off the safe. Like any man, Williams was predictable. Getting what I wanted was just a matter of stroking him the right way. [suspenseful music] [lock clicks] Hello money. The money's outside in the trunk of my car. Go check for yourself. - Don't worry, I believe you. - [Lee] Now how does this scheme work? - We needed a Williams for Hellman. He had to be alive, or Hellman would smell a rat. - So you needed someone willing to say they were Williams right up until the end? How the hell did you find someone willing to do that? - You ain't gonna believe this, but that's my dad. - That's what I'd call unconditional love. You oughta be committed. You would have your own father executed just to pull this off? Jesus Christ, you're gonna be another Mr. Ryan in 10 years. - You got that wrong. The whole idea was Frayerling's. I know it, the guy comes onlike some stupid harmless oaf, but that's just part of his genius. That fucker makes Mr. Ryan looklike a kindergarten teacher. - So Frayerling's still alive? - Yep. And so is Williams. - I think we deserve a drink, don't you huh? [Williams chuckles] Did you see my wife's face? And her pathetic whimpering when you hauled my ass out of the room? - Get changed. - Right. - The only reason I'm still here is for Valentine. Mr. Ryan finds out my dad's a fraud, Valentine's a dead man. - I'm fucking touched, I really am. So does Frayerling have Williams still? - Not quite. Frayerling's smart, but he ain't running the show. - Then who is? - Robert Williams. He's the mastermind behind his own kidnapping. He's been looking to disappear for years now. Tax problems, bad debts, hates his wife. Frayerling goes to Ryan with the idea. - So I have spent months setting this guy up and he has been setting me up all along? - And if Ryan ever finds outthat he's killed the wrong guy, Williams has vanished. Rich, free, and single. - Hold it a minute. What happened? - [Danny] Aw, you sound like you care. - Of course I do. Now tell me what happened. - I was gettin' to that. - You got a half hour to drive to your dad's. Better get going. - Where's the fake blood? - Change of plans. Just in case your father isn't quite as stupid as you are. [ominous music] [gun fires] [Danny groans] - Christ, you've killed me! - Had to make it look real. You're hurt, but you ain't gonna die. Now deal with it. If you run now, go to a hospital, your friend Valentine is gonna spend his final hours being dragged to death behind my car. You understand me boy? - Painkillers. Now go and carry out the plan. Get yourself to this address. We'll be waiting. So will the doctor. I'll have your money, all of it. Do you understand? - Yeah. - [Frayerling] Good. - [Lee] Charming friends you have. - Yeah, nobody said they were my friends. - Do you have any idea what Hellman would do if I told him about your little story? - Yeah, and with my dying breath I would reveal the contents of your car. So can we quit it with the scare tactics? All you gotta do is hold tight, and let this go down. Then I tell you how Williams is holed up. I'm sure blackmail is in your bag of tricks. - You got a deal. - I'm gonna stay here, make my peace with my dad. - Sure you're gonna be able to go through with this? You know you can't pull out now, kid. - Yeah. - That's right, that can't fucking happen or we're all dead. [door creaks] - You mick bastard! Why'd you lie to me? - Don't be so fucking stupid, Dad! - Why'd you lie? - That was bullshit. It was bullshit on the fly. I walk into the room, some psycho bitch is pointing a fucking gun at me. Now we're partners, and she's gone. Frayerling and Williams are dead. They're in a ditch off a countryroad, like I said, I swear. Now you help me save Valentine, and I'll help you save Emma. Like I promised. - You don't understand, do you Danny? You think I'm only here for Emma. No, I'm here for you just as much. I was a worthless father to you, and I've been wrestling with that for years. Since I was watching Emma, dying, in front of me. Helpless to do anything. And now, you're in danger. I can help you. And I will. No regrets. I was so drunk that night. And I really think that had I been sober, I think Iwould not have reacted that way. - Bullshit. You always treated me like a worthless piece of shit. I was the family fuck up, and Emma was your little princess. - I know, Danny. Look, I certainly was out of order that night, and I wanted to relive that night a thousand times. - Yeah, well you beat the shit outta me. I was in more trouble than I could handle, and you beat the shit outta me. But that's okay, you know that's all right 'cause bruises heal, but you know what I can't forget? You know what I can't forgive? Was the way you left. Me and Mom, you just ditched us. Not a phone call, not a letter, not a postcard. Why? What stopped you from calling me in the last eight years? [emotional music] - Nothing. Well, excuses. Fear. To tell you the truth, I was hoping that you would offer me redemption. - Oh Christ. Oh Christ, you really mean that. - I love you, Danny. - I can't do this. I can't go through with this. - You have to. - I can't do this. - You have to, son. Son, you have to. [door creaks] It wasn't until then that the realization hit me that I really was going to die. I'd been too distracted by the guns and lies to really think about it before. For the first time, I became really frightened. [intense music] [phone rings] [bell tolls] [knocking] - Killing time. [ominous music] - We got the ransom. If you have any last words I'd suggest you say them now. [emotional music] - Remember what I told you. - That was deep. What's that supposed to mean? - It's private. - Well if you're not going to share, then you do the honors. [emotional music] - Get it over with. - I can't. - What? - I don't feel like doing this. - You don't feel like it? Can you believe this? You know Mr. Ryan oughta have his head examined, bringing guys like this in on his job. I'll show you how you do it. [gun cocks] - No! [gun fires] [Hellman groans] [gun fires] - Stupid fuck. - Don't move fucker! - Drop the gun, bitch! - Fuck you, Lurch. What the fuck is goin' on, D? [Hellman groans] [suspenseful music] [gun fires] - No don't shoot! - What the fuck is going on? - I know where the money from the safe is! - He's fucking lying! - I know where it is! - Shut up! [gun fires] [gun fires] [dramatic music] - Say goodnight, Mr. Williams. - He's not Mr. Williams! He's my dad. We still got the real Williams. Me and Frayerling still got him, and I know where the money from the safe is. Let us go. You can have the fucking lot. No more chump change, fuck Mr. Ryan. - Lead the way. [sultry jazz music] Hey what are you doing? Move! Come on! Hurry the fuck up! Do him and him. Danny can take us to Frayerling. - You kill them, I ain't taking you anywhere. Take the money and let us go. - Young, do his boyfriend. - Oh fuck. [ominous music] - Mr. Ryan. - Shut up. Lot of money to find in an empty safe. I want to talk to Hellman. - He's dead, shot himself, kinda. And Lee is dead too. - Why is he still here? - He ain't Mr. Williams. He's his dad! - I see. [Ryan laughs] It'd be fair to say this isn't your best work. - [Lawrence] Yes, Mr. Ryan. - [Ryan] Well I'm glad we agree on that. [gun fires] [guns firing] [intense music] - [Danny] Valentine! [gun fires] [guns firing] [glass tinkles] [men grunting] [gun firing] [engine sputters] - Fuck my luck. [gun firing] - No! - Valentine! [gun fires] - [Alan] Danny! [Danny groaning, coughing] [gun fires] [guns firing] [engine sputters] - I can't feel my legs. - Don't worry about it. [gun fires] [engine sputters] Say goodnight, son. [gun fires] [gun firing] [engine revs] - We gotta go back for Valentine. - We can't. [ominous music] - I'm dying anyway. [eerie music] - You have no idea how much excitement the death of Mr. Ryan has caused this morning. - I really don't care. - [Detective] What happened next? - I found out the truth. Let me see. - Get yourself to this address, we'll be waiting and so will the doctor. And we'll have your money, all of it. - You told that woman the truth. - That's right. I'm sorry, Dad. Frayerling told me about Williams and what he needed. I planned the whole thing. - It was your idea to involve me. - Yeah. It was the only way I could think of. Williams is offering so much money. So much money. - And you wanted to get back at me, didn't you? - For Mom. I'm sorry, Dad. Don't, Daddy. - Now it all seems a lot less simple, doesn't it? In the end, you couldn't go through with it. - I saw you crying. I ain't never seen you do that. That's when I understood. - Understood what? - That whatever happens, you're still my dad. - Maybe this time he was telling the truth. Then I remembered, the address. Danny had said there'd be a doctor waiting, and a bag full of money I knew I could use to help Emma. At the time it seemed so clear, that maybe I could save both my children. Maybe none of us would have to die. - [Robert] 631, you transfer the money. Now what the fuck you think I'm paying you for? Close out the account. All right, thank you. All right, here comes our loose end. - [Frayerling] Ah. - [Alan] There's supposed to be a doctor here. - Shouldn't you be dead? - He couldn't go through with it. [Robert sighs] I have a daughter to save. I need Danny's money. I think I've earned it. - Well, no complaints here. I can't imagine who would deserve it more. Go ahead. [gun fires] [dramatic music] You want us to save your daughter, right? He dies, she lives? - Yeah. - [Robert] Come on, we got a delivery to make. - I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry. - Well, your son might be a lying, cheatin' piece of shit, but at least he's got a good heart, hm? [Robert chuckles] [Alan chuckles] - [Frayerling] One more pop for daddio. - No no, why draw attention? Let's go. [Alan laughing] [somber jazz music] [gun fires] - [Detective] You say you heard shots fired. - I did yeah. [gun firing] Two, maybe three. Can't really remember, was only half there. - Let's go. [emotional music] - Here's our missing man. So why didn't Danny take the money? [Danny panting] - I am here for my sister.
