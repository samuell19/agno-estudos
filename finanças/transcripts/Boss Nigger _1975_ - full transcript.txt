(hammer clanging) (upbeat funky music) - Sure is funny how they think we is the devil. - Folks are always scared of things they don't know much about Amos. I reckon the people in this town ain't never seen blacks before. - Well lookie here. - It's the little laundry lady. What you got? - Hey look at that. Hey, now why don't you all act like gentlemen and let that lady pass? - Well I'll be. Come over here and look at this. (laughing) You know I heared about these black devils before, but I sure ain't never seen one before. You know this one even sasses too. (laughing) - Yeah. I wonder if the black comes off. (thumping) - Now I hope you're fast 'cause if you ain't you is dead. Come on get up, go on. All I ask is for you all to act like gentlemen. Now apologize to the lady, with the hats off. (gun firing) - We's terribly sorry we troubled you ma'am. - Now I want you to just leave holding hands. Real nice like. (gun firing) Skip along. Go ahead, go ahead. (laughing) - We don't want no trouble Amos. We just want our reward and keep moving. - I just didn't like their looks. Besides I love fat women. (funky music) Don't look like nobody been here for quite a spell. (funky music) You sure you want to stay here? (funky music) - Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor a couple of niggers just busted into the sheriff's office. - I saw. (funky music) Well all be damned. What are you niggers doing here, what do you want? - Well who are you and what the hell do you want fat cheeks? - You happen to be talking to the mayor of this town nigger. - The mayor. Amos this here is the mayor. - Is you the mayor? - That's right, I'm the mayor and if you don't shuffle on out of here I'm liable to have you tarred and feathered out of town. - Well now Mr. Mayor you don't seem to understand. I'm your new sheriff. - I's your new deputy. (laughing) - A couple of jokers. - We found this here note on the body of dead gunfighter signed by you. Sure enough made for interesting reading. - I wonder if the town folk knows you is hitched up with Jed Clayton? - Now we don't want nothing from your town Mayor. All we want is Jed. - Yeah there's a big reward for him. - Oh I see. My goodness. You gotta be a couple of bounty hunters. - Well you all been hunting black folks for so long. We just want to see what it felt like to hunt white folks. - How in the hell am I gonna explain to the good people of this town about a nigger being their sheriff? - That's your problem. - Mr. Mayor can you sign this poster? We need your mark so as we can collect the reward for a Jack Meckiff. - Jack Meckiff, who's he? - That's the dead man that's outside. - Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. There's some gentlemen over at the saloon and they want to talk to you. - Jed Clayton? - Now listen we don't need no bounty hunters in town stirring up trouble with Jed. He comes into town twice a month, takes what he needs and skedaddles on out of here. Now you rile him up we're liable to have more problems than all of us put together could handle. Hank get the undertaker to get that dead man on a horse out of here. - Yeah. - Well now Mr. Mayor a riled up Jed in your town, that's your problem. But your problem ain't our problem lessen you pays us and since you ain't paying us we'll just stay around and collect that reward. - What are we gonna do now Boss? Wait and follow him out of town? - Nope, let's mosey over to the saloon. Might be interesting. (honky tonk piano music) (horse neighing) (laughing) - So he said a little of what you fancy does you good. (laughing) Oh, here's a fine upstanding bunch of citizens. - Hi Bunny. - Good day Mr. Mayor, sleep well? (laughing) He knew me well enough last night. (laughing) See all of you gentlemen later. (laughing) - Now look Mayor Jed is plenty mad about your townsfolk hiding all the women and supplies from us when we comes to town. - We can't afford to keep on giving you boys supplies without you all paying for them. - Oh but Mayor Jed is paying you. Now he ain't killed a single person in this town. Now if you don't want that to change. The general store better be full of supplies when we get back. Hey bartender bring us another round of drinks on the mayor. (laughing) - Here Kitty take the boys a bottle. - Thank you Miss. - Hey darling you're moving too slow, give me that. - Give me a little kiss. - Hey Mayor ain't you gonna drink up? Hey you guys see what I see? Hey, hey, hey look. See what I see huh? You don't have to move off so fast. You don't gotta be afraid of that black devil. Mayor where are you going? Aren't you going to stick around for the party, huh? - Hey nigger, come here and shine my boots. (laughing) - Me sir? - Yeah you. - You're the only nigger I see. (laughing) - Oh thank you sir, thank you. Thank you, thank you. How you do, how you do, how you do? Thank you sir, I've been shining white folks boots nearly as far back as I can recollect, thank you sir. I appreciate it, thank you. - Get a move on boy. - Yeah boy. - Come on. (laughing) - Thank you sir, thank you. (laughing) - I wonder if he thinks like he's walking. (laughing) - Shine 'em good boy. - Yeah shine 'em good. He ain't never seen no polish yet. (laughing) - Do a good job. - Yeah shine them boots. (laughing) (gun firing) (thumping) (screaming) - What? (screaming) He shot my foot. - Yeah I'm sorry about that. Get up. - I can't walk, I got a hole in my foot. - You got one good foot. (groaning) Alright Amos, bring the other one. - See ya folks. (funky music) (groaning) - Mayor. - Yes Miss Pruitt? - Who are those two strangers? - That nigger, I think I heard his lackey call him Boss. He's a bounty hunter Miss Pruitt here looking for Jed Clayton. Could mean a little trouble for our town. - We can't have any more trouble than we already have. Being robbed and hiding our womenfolk every time Jed and his gang come to town. - Miss Pruitt as long as I'm your mayor there'll be no more molesting of our good womenfolk. Mark my word, I guarantee there'll be peace and prosperity in our little town. (groaning) - My foot. I need a doctor. - Come on boy, you can make it. - I was just standing at the bar minding my own business. - Shut up before I blow your brains out. - Sure was nice of that sheriff to leave this jail for us, comes in mighty handy. I'll get the key. - Well now you niggers really put the town in a spot. When Jed finds out you killed two of his boys he'll be riding here and taking it out on the whole town. - Like I done told you before Mayor you ain't paying me to listen to your troubles so quit bothering me with them. - I'll tell you what, if you leave town now maybe Jed will follow you and that way you'll have a chance to get him maybe and it'll be easier on the whole town. - We ain't leaving this town till we get that reward. Right now I'm hungry. I'm going up to the hotel to get something to eat. Amos. - Let us out Mayor and I'll tell Jed you had nothing to do with it. - Oh pipe down back there. Don't worry, it's not like they're going to kill you. - You better get us out of here or Jed will tear the entire town apart. - Good afternoon gentlemen and welcome to our town. My name is Miss Pruitt, I'm the school teacher here, but I recall living in Boston and my family had black people working for it. They were good people. They used to sing and dance a lot. I used to love to watch them. - Thank you for the welcome ma'am. When you get back to Boston you be sure and tell my people that you just met two niggers who don't know how to sing or dance. - They're escaping, they're getting away. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Hold it. You were gonna leave without saying goodbye. Now that makes me real mad. (gun firing) (screaming) That ought to keep you still for a while. - You alright ma'am? - Yes thank you. - You're gonna have to crawl, come on crawl. (groaning) - How'd they get out of jail? - I suggest you ask your mayor that. - I got the key with me this time. Wait a minute. (water splashing) (laughing) - Look he knows he's a nigger. I knows I's a nigger so you don't have to tell us we is. But now even niggers got to eat so go get me some food before I blow your damn head off. - Yes sir, Mr. Nigger, oh dear I mean yes sir. (dramatic music) (lively music) - Hold it, hold it. Stop the music boys. Let me have your attention fellow citizens. We have a very important city council meeting. It's an emergency, we need the hall. And I'm sure you'll all cooperate. Will you please leave the hall now? - Listen Mr. Mayor. - Thank you, thank you. (chattering) (dramatic music) - Really Mr. Mayor. I don't interfere with your night time activities. How come you're interfering with mine? - Now Bubbles I'll see that you're well taken care of. Be a sport. - Alright. - Gentlemen, come here please. Please. I called this meeting gentlemen because we have a very serious problem at hand. Three of Jed's boys were killed here today and as you all know Jed's gonna take it out on the town. - What are we gonna do about it Mayor? - Anyone of you gentlemen want the job of sheriff? - Mayor you know that none of are any good with a gun. - We wouldn't stand a chance. - Well that's true. I say we talk to Jed when he comes into town. We explain to him it was that nigger who killed his men. - I agree with the mayor, we should elect us a new sheriff. (door banging opening) - That won't be necessary gentlemen. I just swore in your new deputy and made myself the sheriff. - Well listen you ain't got no right. - This gives me the right. (suspenseful funky music) Any more objections? Good. Then you gentlemen all agree that we should be the law. Thank you. You've made a wise decision. - See I told you they liked us. - Good day. - I don't like no niggers being the law in my town. - When Jed finds out it was them uppity niggers that killed his boys he won't be sheriff long. - I don't know, I just don't like the idea. I mean suppose they start pestering our women folk. My Sarah being touched by a nigger. No I just don't like it. - Well it seems like the only thing we can do. Not one of us can stand up to those gun fighters. - Alright gentlemen this meeting is adjourned till tomorrow. - Alright. I don't know. - Good morning gentlemen. It's my pleasure to tell you that-- - Sir, you are interrupting our breakfast. We never discuss business while we're eating. So if you would be so kind as to wait outside until we're finished we would be happy to talk to you then. - Yes. Certainly. (laughing) - Where'd you learn to talk like that? - I've been wanting to say that to somebody for eight years. My slave master said that to me once. It sounded so pretty I never forgot it. (laughing) (funky music) (laughing) (suspenseful music) - What's on your mind Mayor? - The committee decided this morning in the town council meeting that we select you sheriff to help us against Jed. - Well, looks like we're working for you after all. - Alright, raise your right hand and swear-- - Nevermind all that just give me the badge. - Thank you gentlemen, good day. - Oh Mayor, one more thing, have somebody clean up my office. (sighing) Here you are deputy. I'm going to check on Clara Mae, see how she's making out. - Okay. (calm acoustic guitar music) (speaking in a foreign language) - Hello Clara Mae. Well, I see you got yourself a job. - Hi, yes, Pedro agreed to let me stay here in the back. - That's mighty fine. Why don't you fill up one of them glasses then. - Pedro asked me to invite you to dinner tonight. - Well that's mighty nice of Pedro. Tell him I'd be glad to accept. See you at dinner then. (speaking in a foreign language) Why is the boy crying ma'am? - He's crying because he's hungry senor. (speaking in a foreign language) Where do you take him senor? - Into town, trust me. (funky music) - Sam. Hey Sam. - What? - Look what's coming down the street. Look what that nigger sheriff's bringing to the town. - You all get away from here making all that noise before I throw you in jail for disturbing the peace. I'm trying to sleep. (funky music) - Yes sir, can I help you? - That's for you Pancho. - Gracias. - Gracias senor. - Hey now wait a minute these people ain't got no money. Who's gonna be paying for all of this? - Don't worry about it. - Now listen, you take that dress, you're gonna have to pay for it. - Put it on my bill. - What bill? You ain't got no bill here. - For you Clara Mae. - Thank you. - You can't do this, just because you think you're sheriff you can't just walk in here and take anything you want. Now help, somebody help me stop this nigger. He's cleaning out my store. - Deputy do your duty. - Sir you are under arrest. - Me, what for? He's the one breaking the law. He's cleaning out my supplies. - We're on the town payroll. - Sir you have broken the black law number six, being called a nigger in public, now that's $20 or two days in jail. - This is outrageous. Alright, alright I'll pay. Here. - Alright Pancho, don't go getting fat on me. - Muchas gracias senor. (funky music) - Okay, come on, break it up, break it up. Go ahead break it up. (funky music) (birds chirping) (gun firing) - Hey it's me you fool, the mayor. - You better knock first. (knocking on door) - Yeah? - It's me Jed, the mayor. I gotta talk to you. - Alright wait just a minute. Come on in. Out mamasita. Damn you always come at the wrong time. - We got troubles Jed. There's a bounty hunter in town. A nigger, can you beat that? He's killed three of your boys, locked up another one and the committee voted him sheriff and I couldn't stop them. - Well, me and the boys will just have to make a run into town. Bullets cost money Mayor. (fingers snapping) Come on. - Bullets. Now, you got the money, what are you gonna do? - Oh Mayor you know you never question me do you? (slap thwacking) - I wasn't questioning you Jed, I was just asking. - Good. I'm gonna finish what I was doing when you come in here. And then me and the boys are gonna have ourselves some fun. You pick up that stinking cigar and get out of here. (thumping) (yelling) Mamasita get on back in here. - Good day sir, ma'am. I said good day sir. (gasping) - What are you doing with my husband? What are you doing? (shouting) What are you doing to my husband? (shouting) - Now ma'am if you don't stop I'll have to throw you in jail. - What's the meaning of this insult? - Ma'am he has broken one of our laws. Number seven, insulting an officer of the law. Now that's $5 or one day in jail. - That's ridiculous. - He broke the law, not me. I is the law. I think I just let him sit a spell. - No, no, here I'll pay the fine. - Sir I cannot take no money from no prisoners lessen I officially charges you. - Honey pay the man. - Oh Jethro, Jethro what's happening to our town? - I sure hope it's worth it. - Go ahead, you free. Good day sir. - Good day deputy. - Yes, good day deputy. (laughing) - Hey you know maybe you being sheriff ain't such a bad idea after all. - Senor. (speaking in a foreign language) - Hey. (speaking in a foreign language) Hey listen. Hey what's wrong with you, are you crazy? Hey. (speaking in a foreign language) Hey not down there. - I think she just wants to wash your clothes Amos and my guess is for free. - Hey. (speaking in a foreign language) Quit it. You crazy? - Well you look like you're gonna be busy Amos. I'll make this round alone. - Hey Boss. Hey Boss, Boss, don't leave me here with this crazy lady. Boss! (hooves trotting) - Give me a box of 4440s. Couple of packs of that tobacco over there. - Morning Sheriff. My name's Pete, I'm the blacksmith here. That's my shop right across the street. Please drop by if you need anything. - Thank you, I might do that. - Good. - Would you like to pay for that now? - Add a pair of 13 boots on your list. Bill it to the mayor. - The mayor? (laughing) (funky music) - Oh. I was just taking a nap. - Yeah it looks like you got your shirt washed too Amos. (laughing) - I think I'll look over the town. - Don't you think you better get dressed first? - Oh yeah you're right. Okay. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) - No, help! (shushing) - Don't move. I ain't gonna hurt you now. Now you be nice to me and I'll be nice to you. Are you scared shine? So soft like velvet. I got lots of power around here. I could make it good for you around here. How about it? You won't regret it. That's a girl. That's a girl. That's a girl. (thumping) (yelling) (crying) - Good morning gentlemen. - Morning. - I was just on my way to the hotel to have some breakfast and I would enjoy your company. - Oh well ma'am I don't reckon the town folk would like that. - The town folk are too worried about Jed and his gang to be concerned with what I do. - Well Amos take care of the office, be right back. Ma'am. - This is crazy, who do they think they are? Ridiculous nonsense. Take your filthy black hands off me nigger. - That black sheriff's deputy he's gone plum crazy. He just locked up the bank president. - Hey what gives Amos? - I tacked up one of our posters in front of his bank. He took it down. I ordered him to put it back and he refused and called me a nigger. Now he broke two laws. I told him that would be $30 or four days in jail. He wouldn't pay up so there he is. - A nigger huh? (groaning) So you called my deputy a nigger huh? Well now he was just doing his duty. That's a $20 fine or one day in jail. - I won't pay you a cent. When the mayor hears of this he'll have your hide. - Well till then we have yours. - Hey you, what's the meaning of this outrageous insult to our bank resident? - He broke two of our laws and refused to pay the fine. - Well I demand you release him right now. - You don't demand nothing from us. Now you and your yes man just get out of my office. - I'm not leaving here until you release him. Hey you can't do this, I'm the mayor. - A $5 fine or one day in jail for disturbing the peace. - Alright Frank pay him and get me out of here. Ridiculous. Oh pay his fine too. - Thanks gentlemen, come again won't you? - Hey how about getting me a doctor to look at my feet? - Hey I nearly forgot all about him. I'll go see if I can find a doctor. You seen the doc? - He was headed out to Miss Pruitt's place. - Whereabouts is that? - Go down the end of the road, turn left, and it's the first homestead around the bend. (funky music) (knocking on door) - Sorry to trouble you Miss Pruitt, is the doc here? - Yes he is. Come on in. - Good afternoon Doc. - What is it? - There's a fellow up at the jail that needs fixing up. - What's the matter with him? - Well seems like he got a little foot trouble. - You gonna be alright Miss Pruitt? - Sure Doc. - Yeah Doc, she's in good hands. - I want to think so. - Ole Doc's a worrier ain't he? Well it's a nice place you have here Miss Pruitt. Guess I best be going. - Why don't you stay a spell and have some coffee or apple pie? I make the best in town. - Yes I'm sure you do. - Look I want to apologize for yesterday. I didn't mean it the way it sounded. What I was really trying to say was well I judge a man by his deeds and not by his color. - Well I guess I did kind of get my spurs all riled up. (dramatic music) That's just to satisfy your curiosity. - He's gonna be alright. - So is Miss Pruitt Doc. - I want to give you some advice young fella. Miss Pruitt's a very fine young lady. She's the one pillar of courage in this gutless town and she's like a daughter to me so I want to tell you something. Just watch it. - Uh-huh, and you don't want her made dirty by a nigger. Well now let me give you some advice Doc. You just tend to sewing him up because pretty soon you're gonna be needed around here and you can't do much of that without your bag. (fingers snapping) - Forgot my bag again. (dog barking) (rooster crowing) (funky music) - Whoa. - Got some dynamite from the store. Figured I blow them out. Town's still asleep. - Alright you take big Joe and go out behind the jail. We'll wait for that nigger out here in front. Go on Joe. (suspenseful funky music) - Hey Ben. Ben, wake up Ben. Hey Ben. Stand away from this wall. I'm gonna set some dynamite to it. (suspenseful funky music) (explosion booming) (yelling) (coughing) (guns firing) (shouting) (coughing) - Get 'em Stacy. Ah we got that nigger. Let's get out of here. (guns firing) (shouting) (hooves trotting away) (dog barking) - There's only one of them niggers left now. Let's get him. (suspenseful funky music) - Which one of you brave souls want to die first huh? You? How about you? Amos? Amos? (groaning) Amos. Amos. (groaning) - My daddy always told me that bed would be the death of me. I didn't think he meant it this way. - Come on Amos. - That was a hell of a party wasn't it? (guns firing) (screaming) (laughing) (guns firing) (screaming) (laughing) (guns firing) (screaming) (guns firing) (shouting in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Pancho! (crying) - Here, give this to your nigger sheriff. (crying) (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) - What's wrong Margarita? - It was Jed. They came to my house. They took Clara Mae and they killed my Pancho. Pancho. They gave me this. - What is it? - It's Jed, he kidnapped Clara Mae and they killed Pancho. - It's your fault that they killed my Pancho. (shouting in a foreign language) You never should've come here, never! (crying) Pancho. Pancho. (crying) Pancho. - Take care of her. (dramatic music) - Here. It's for you. - It's from Jed. He wants me to meet him. - You can't go Boss. He's sure to kill you. - See that Pancho's mother is taken care of. - They'll kill you for what you did to his men. - Maybe. Maybe, not. - Does she mean that much to you? I don't want you to go. I don't want you to be killed. - If I don't go I'll be just like the other men in this town afraid of their own shadow. (funky music) (thudding) - Do you think that nigger will be here? - Yeah he'll show up. He wants a little of that black stuff. - Hey Jed Swin's back and he brought something back with him. (suspenseful music) (crying) (yelling) - So this is the nigger that killed my men. (thumping) (suspenseful music) (thumping) (suspenseful music) (thwacking) (suspenseful music) - Hold out his hand. Give me a gun. (gun firing) (screaming) - Your death is gonna be slow and painful nigger. - Oh god. (laughing) (yelling) - Take him and tie him to a post and let the sun work on him for a while. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) You hurry up with that water nigger gal. (funky music) Where's that water gal? (funky music) - Come on honey. Be nice to me like you're with Jed okay? (thumping) - Is Boss still alive? - Yes and he's tied to post near the shed. - How many men they got up there watching him? - I could only see one. - Give this to Boss. - It's a lovely night. It's too bad you're too busy to enjoy it. - I'll be off guard in a few hours. - Well in a few hours I'll be with Jed and you seem to be more man than he is. - Where is that nigger bitch? - You better get in there, Jed's calling for you. (thudding) - Park! - Yeah? - Come in here and keep your eye on this gal. I got a few words to say to the mayor. (suspenseful music) (funky music) - My goodness it's warm in here. - Yeah. (funky music) - Do you mind if I open the window? - No. - 'Cause after a while it's really gonna get hot in here. - Yeah. (funky music) (laughing) (moaning) - You sure is a handsome man, really handsome. (thudding) - I'm sorry I didn't hit him sooner but I got carried away watching you. - Amos where is your shirt? - I left it in my saddle bags. I figured they wouldn't be able to see me this way. We gotta help Boss. (groaning) - What happened? - You almost made it boy, almost. Now get up, come on get up. Go over to the door. You tell your man to bring in Boss. - Who? - The nigger, boy, the nigger. Do like I tell you. - Hey Sunny, bring that big nigger in the shed. - I can't do that without Jed's orders. - Don't argue with me, do as I say. Jed put me in charge till he gets back, now move! - Come on. - Come on help him over there. - Where's Jed Amos? - Jed's in town. We gotta get you to a doctor. - Alright. - You got a strong back boy. Come on get down on that floor. On your knees, do it. - Where are we taking him? We can't take him to town. The mayor's sure to tell Jed where he is. - The only place I know is that school teacher's house. She's kind of sweet on him anyhow. It's the only safe place. Go ahead. Here, take his gun. What's your name boy, huh? - Park, Park Collins. - Do you want it? - No, no. - Doesn't matter. (thumping) (honky tonk piano music) - You know Mayor I believe you. I don't think you would make a nigger sheriff of this town. - Well like I told you Jed, he just rode in here and took over. Said he was looking for you. - Is that right? - That's right. - Well I don't think you gotta worry about him no more. - No, he's sort of tied up right now. (laughing) - And by the way Mayor we're gonna be leaving these parts tomorrow. When I get back I want that store full of supplies because if it ain't we're gonna take a whole lot of pleasure in going into every house in this town and taking just what we want. Know what I mean? Mayor Griffin. - Oh my god. Bring him in and put him in my bed. - Clara Mae, go get the doctor and bring him here. - What happened to you? - If I know Boss it ain't half as bad as what's gonna happen to them. - Amos, Amos go get us some ammo, we're gonna need it. - Just be still, you aren't going nay place. - I'll get it for you Boss. Just do like Miss Pruitt tells you till the doc gets here. - Amos. - Just be still, lay down. (knocking on door) He must like you a lot honey, to risk his life for you. - I like him a lot too. - He's gonna need a lot of rest and a lot of caring. - Well I guess I'll give him the rest and she's all ready to do the caring. Doesn't look like he's gonna get that rest Doc. (dramatic music) - You're gonna leave town soon aren't you Boss? I don't want to see you killed. - I ain't leaving this town till I gets me Jed Clayton. - When you go will you take me with you? - No. My kind of life just ain't for you Clara Mae. - You always kill for money? - No, not always. But sometimes I just can't help it. - I'll go with you no matter what you do. - You'll have to wait. The patient's getting fixed up right now. Want some tea? (laughing) - Might as well. (horse neighing) (thumping) - Where's the nigger? - He's in the shed with Park. He told me to take him inside. - Where is he? - I was hit on the head first and then the other nigger made me go tell Sunny to bring the big nigger inside and then he hit me again. That's all I remember. - Alright, too late to follow him now, probably gone too far. We'll get ourselves some sleep and we'll move out tomorrow. Pick ourselves up a wagon in that Mexican town. (birds chirping) - Clara Mae. Clara Mae. Where's Amos? - Amos, Amos. Boss wants to see you. (groaning) - Amos you get the ammo, the gun? - Here Boss. - Good. We'll be starting after them soon. - You won't have to. Doc heard the boys talking in town. Jed's due in town today to get some supplies. - That's good. Get everything Amos, you know what to do. - Okay Boss. - Clara Mae, you go to the cantina, stay off the street. (funky music) (horse whinnying) - Whoa. Let's stop in and have a drink before we go to town. (cheering) (laughing) (cheering) (laughing) - Look what I got here. - No, take your hands of me. (cheering) (laughing) - Oh I've seen this one before. Yeah I think I want to try me some of this again. Come here blackie. You come on to Jed. Come here you black bitch. - No. Get off of me. (glass shattering) (gun firing) (laughing) - That'll show her. - Let's get the hell out of here. (suspenseful funky music) - Jed's at the cantina and he's killed a black girl. They're coming into town now. - Jed's men, they're at the cantina now. - No Boss, wait no. Boss no. No Boss you can't go now. We've got to do just like we've planned. (suspenseful funky music) - Whoa. Oh it sure is quiet here. I reckon everybody's scared to come out. Alright load up that wagon. (explosion booming) (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (explosion booming) (guns firing) (explosion booming) (guns firing) (thudding) (gun firing) (gun clicking) Hey Sheriff, Sheriff you're not gonna shoot an unarmed man are you? (yelling) (thumping) (groaning) (guns firing) (groaning) - That's for little Pancho. (gun firing) (groaning) That's for me. - Go ahead and kill me nigger. - Mr. Nigger to you. - Go to hell Mr. Nigger. - To hell is where you're going. This is for Clara Mae. (gun firing) (gun firing) (groaning) (gun firing) (groaning) (dramatic music) Amos, don't let me die in a white folks' town Amos. - You ain't gonna die Boss. - Amos. Get me out of here Amos. - Okay, sure Boss. I'll get Jed's body and put it in the wagon okay?
