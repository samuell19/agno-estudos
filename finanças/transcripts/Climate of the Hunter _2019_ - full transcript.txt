Morning. I barely slept. I had jet-lag from hell. Sorry to hear that. What do we know about his travel arrangements? I... I didn't pry. Of course not, I just Did he happen to mention his itinerary? He said he would get here later today and we'd all have dinner this evening. We would catch up. I don't know. Such a mild winter. Look, are you sure you don't want to go for a walk with me? You can take Otis. Oh, right! Otis! Oh, come here Otis. Come here you sweet, beautiful boy. He's not gonna respond well to that. He didn't like that stuff. So you've trained him to be as personable as you are. No, he's just not like other dogs. He's more philosophical than that, thank God. And I'm not impersonable. I just don't need to make a big production out of everything all the time. Or do anything at all, it would seem. That him? That's him. Sure of it. As if you would know. It's been 20 years. That's him. I have a dim, half remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness. There was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant. And then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life, as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Can it be, a star is a star do I press thee to my heart in the night of distance far, what deep gulf, what bitter smart? Yes, 'tis thou indeed at last are my joys my partner's den. Wesley! Of course, you can't just walk into a room like everyone else. Not when your occasion demands so much more. I was cursed, by the way. Was your traveling that difficult? Not with such a brilliant destination so firmly in mind. And you've brought wine, how thoughtful. We only have a little. And who's this one? That's my Otis. He's a philosopher. Here, let me take that. Oh, a Tempranillo. A Rioja. The spiciest I could find. Just the lightest kiss of oak. I'll get the table set and pour the wine. Let me take care of you. You gotta be tired from traveling. Certainly won't object. I imagine I'm in capable hands. Seven layer sandwich cake with tomatoes and peas. With all this time, Federico is thinking about the Feijoada he had eaten earlier. Feijoada is a very rich pork of stew. It's really popular in Brazil. And this Feijoada, was having its way with Federico's stomach. So, poor man is praying for guidance and he's praying for clarity, but more than anything, he is praying that his priestly guts will settle down and that this most likely career-ending, eschatological fart will dissolve and leave him alone. So Federico prays with all his might. He's giving it all he's got. And finally he opens his eyes. And he sees the bishop sitting there looking patient, like a kindly, old grandfather. And just as Federico is about to cross himself Kablamo! He lets loose, with the last trumpet of the apocalypse out his ass. The stained glass windows shake. And Federico swore to me that he saw a tear run down the Virgin Mary's statue's face. "Wesley!" He says to me later with tears in his eyes, "that was the last time I ever prayed. That fart ruined my faith in God!" Likely story. But very artfully told. No, no, no. It's all true. He owns a knife shop in Sao Paolo now. Is the city very beautiful? I've heard mixed reports. In it's own way. Parts of it are beautiful. There's a kind of grandeur to the decadence. The rich are very rich. And the poor very poor. I almost lost sleep some nights with a guilty conscience, especially since I was living off of my wife's money. But I fed every beggar I could. - And how is - ALMA: But you You didn't just live in Sao Paolo, where else was it? The other coastal city, not Rio Elizabeth, you wanted to ask me about Genevieve. Oh no, no. I mean I didn't. I didn't mean to pry. It's alright. She's not the person that she used to be but she's still the bravest woman I know. The doctors don't know the whole story but her story will likely be ending soon. I'm so sorry. Yes, God bless her. Oh God, I don't think so. I'm afraid we are all alone my dear. But you're not alone. Forgive me, of course not. Forgive my sturm and drang. Now I've been talking too long. Tell me about yourselves. Should I go first? Please. Well, my life is very simple. Probably pales in comparison. I stain and carve my wood sculptures and occasionally I sell some of them. And, what about David? We haven't, talked in a while. David moved out of state with his second wife years ago. We're friendly enough when we have to be. So, Elizabeth. Tell us about yourself. Tell us about your life in D.C. Oh, well. There's really, there's not much to tell. I've been there. Oh God. 15 years now. At the same firm for 10. Family law, which can be heartbreaking. And there's a lot about the city which is wonderful mainly the music, the art, parties with important people. Also a real pain in the ass. I work 50 to 60 hours a week so there's really not much to Excuse me, I. I'm still suffering from jet-lag. Take it easy. Careful. Are you alright? Maybe just a bit too much wine. Just breathe man. I think I should sit down. I really, just needed time to reflect hence, this trip. Paris is dismal in the winter time anyway. I can only imagine what you've been dealing with. My divorce was a lot. It almost broke me but it's You know I hate coming back to the States. Especially in times like these but I've been wondering, if I can make a home here now. I didn't want to mention it at dinner but last year I had Genevieve committed to an institution and it's become that severe. Geez, I'm so sorry. I now understand. I thought that you were legally separated. Well, I still love her very much. That hasn't changed. You know, she's just barely there anymore. But coming back to the States? Could you even do that? I didn't think so. But, I've had to admit that that level of care Genevieve could receive here. There wasn't any other consideration. What would you do here? Write, I suppose. I'd like to publish again. It hasn't changed a bit, this place. The stars are in exactly the same place they were when we were children. You see that? Come here, look. What is it? You see it? Look. She is the brightest one in this portion of the sky. That's Vega. They say 12,000 years ago, she was the Pole star. The guiding star. - I see it. - Yeah, that one right there. She's my favorite. She shines for you. Well, goodnight my dear. G'night. Cheese fondue. With a selection of sides. I feel like I should apologize to Wesley for last night. I must've been more tired than I thought. There's no need to apologize. You were hot like a light-bulb. You two stay up long after? Not too long. Talk about anything interesting? He showed me his favorite star. Like in the sky? It was sweet. Sweet? He's a grown man. Right on. You think he's handsome? Years ago, maybe, I did. And now he's even more impressive in many ways but he's getting a little, I don't know, what do people say? Long in the tooth. We all are. Oh my God. You two, you just might be perfect for each other. What does that mean? Obviously, you need someone to occupy you to give you some direction and he needs someone to take care of. Clearly into sick women. You can't say things like that. What? Just trying to give you a jolt because you need to wake up. You're getting some funny ideas, Alma. Hey Alma. Hey, BJ. You startled me. Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. I was just walking around, thought I saw things. So I came over. How long have you been standing there? Not long, I just walked up. I was walking past I was going off to my cabin, wanna come with me? Cool. And that's why you've got that weird angle on JFK's head. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. In the winter it gets real lonely. It's like a goddamn ghost town. And then we've got all these new people coming in, fuckin' strangers. What strangers? You got that, that tall lady, with the fancy clothes Are you talking about my sister? That's Elizabeth. You've known her for years. Oh. Oh. Well, you hear that old mystery man too? Wesley? Yeah. Oh. He's a great guy. Well I was, now I know I usually dig through people's trash, but I found a few things in there and then I was watching him walk down the road he was talking to himself and he stopped and he just stared off. Oh, he's a writer. I think they do that sometimes, man Yeah, maybe. Maybe. I don't know. And he just got here yesterday. You're being paranoid. I learned to trust my intuitions and my prejudices. Wesley? Wesley? Before us lay a green sloping land of forests and woods, with here and there, steep hills Wesley? Dad. Percy. Come on in. I'd rather not. No? Okay. I'd rather fish. You wanna fish? Yes. Right now? Yes. Why are you confused? Okay. This is all I really wanted. You still writing? Yes, my short stories. I'd be glad to look at anything you've got. - You want me to - Absolutely not. Have you thought any more about the cabin? I'm selling it. Yes, you made that abundantly clear last time we talked I just thought maybe you've had time to reconsider. I don't have the time to fuck with it. It really doesn't require much upkeep. We've always been able to pay someone. You said the cabin was mine and that I could do with it as I please. I'm a grown man and I want to sell it. Why did you say that if you're just gonna keep badgering me about it? I know you don't understand this now but these things get more important as you get older. I just don't want you to regret selling it. I always pictured it will be passed down to the generations. What generations? Mom's gone, you'll live forever and I'll never have children. Never say never. Never. And don't speak of your mother as if she were no longer with us. Saw her a week ago. She's no longer with us. Mom? Mom, it's me Percy. I must admit, I was downhearted when my Wesley abandoned me. Though I understand I was becoming quite a burden to him. And the boy of course. The angel of my heart. So pure and susceptible to life's cruel misunderstandings. I just wanted to let you know that I don't condone you living here or how you got here. Please know that I had no say in it. You know how Dad is when he has his mind set on something. I think you're perfectly fine. Just look at you. You know I used to love, staring out the window just barely breathing. It's an absolutely normal thing to do. I hate to tell you this but I think Dad might be the most selfish person I've ever met. I imagine he must spend his time chasing strangers all over the globe now. You and I both know that he's had affairs. This is just typical of him to give out pussy in his twilight years or whatever these are to him. So I just wanted you to know that I'll always be here. I'm just a phone call away Mom. Just have to pick up the phone and dial the number to hear my voice. For that, I brought you a telephone. Here. Just say, "Oh Percy. I'm so glad I caught you at home". And then I'm on the other end and I say, "Oh Mom, it's so good to hear from you. Can't believe we haven't talked in almost a week I've been so busy. Yeah, I bet you've been busy too". And then we just, talk about the affairs of the day Mom. We just talk. So what was it that made you decide that you can't take care of her anymore? Any moment in particular? It wasn't any one instance. It was an accumulation of things. Can't believe your conscience is clear in this. You'd rather walk out and act out some kind of caricature of a married widower. I never said I had a clear conscience. It was a difficult decision to make but it had to be done. If you cared for her as much as you say you do then you would do better than this. You know you don't mean that. I do mean it. You left Mom. Abandoned her. Actually so you could sit here and smoke your pipe in peace pretending there's no ugliness in the world. It's amazing to me that you would leave her in that place, imprisoned in her own body. You're lying son. I'm telling the truth. How can you not consider your life a waste? Is the idea supposed to be that you spend it now with someone who isn't half the woman Mom is? - Does love just transfer over? - That's enough! I might spend too much time, pretending that your words don't hurt me but they do. Yes, perhaps I could've saved your mother from all this if I had known. I think about it every day. You should've known. But I didn't. What happened to your mother was unfortunate, to say the least. But we both knew the risks. She told me of them herself before introducing me to this dark life of ours, where we both live under a constant death sentence. Bullshit! That's everyone. True enough, we don't get a special dispensation. But oddly enough, the lack of right that we face the lack of clarity deepens the mortal shadows, sharpens them so they cut us more deeply. I don't expect you to understand. But with time one comes to realize that certain advantages may perhaps outweigh the risks that come with this beautiful curse. It's an exhilarating level of freedom. But one dearly bought, remember her at her best. I do. Okay Dad. I get it. Look, I don't think I'll ever stop blaming you entirely, but I'll try. That's all I'd ever ask from you, son. So, I hope you're hungry. It's time we got reacquainted with some wonderfully weird sisters that I know. Crown of Frank fritters with baked potato soup and pear and tuna salad. So I tell him, "the world can catch fire rivers turn to blood, but you absolutely have to get sick the next time you're in Montreal! When you were telling that story you reminded me of how cute you were when you were a baby. Yes! You were such a sweet little baby boy. Stop it. This one kept us so busy. When you could pull yourself away from your writing, and your carousing. Well, you saw to that. Girls, our generation got it from both ends. No attention whatsoever from our own parents but we were expected to give all of ours to our children. Ain't that the truth. You're lucky to have me. Yes, you're both so lucky to have such wonderful children. Indeed. When you think of the world populated by so many people an unthinkable number of people coming and going being born and dying every day It's just staggering. Why would anyone want to hang to that unruly mess? That teeming hoard of suffering and pain? And yet we do. Something in us insists on it. Maybe make an urge. And then, we got a new life on our hands. Dependent on us, to grow and flower forth into this distinct, unique individual that the world has never seen before. You've got the world, just kinda like an infinity, and then you've got infinity plus one. And it is the plus ones that make all the difference. But all of this just sounds really basic, right? Simple, yes. But hardly basic. And it becomes extraordinary when you realize that this infinity of people is just really a collection of plus ones. And you get vertigo really quickly when you think about this near infinity of individual beings each one a thinking and feeling person. It's like, it's like being in the country and looking up into the sky at night get lost in the limitless distance, the unfathomable depth of starlight. Edgar Allan Poe, proved ingeniously, that the universe was finite. By the very simple fact, that if it wasn't there would be so many stars that their aggregate light would make the sky look like one undifferentiated, luminous white mass. But, since it is finite, we are tempted to appreciate everyone, though there are far too many and yet each one of them, a name and to care for them on their own. Now we're in for it. Last night, Alma and I experienced the miracle that was looking out at Vega, the second brightest star in the sky and my favorite. And it was, beautiful. Although, I should say one of my favorites because who could choose one single one from all that beauty? The second brightest. Yes, the second brightest. Sirius, also known as the Dog Star shines far brighter. And one evening, you and I may experience a Sirius, in all her splendor and glory. And while we would have a similarly lovely but entirely different experience. God, there's so many stars in the sky. There's Arcturus and Deneb. The world has an uncountable number of experiences. That, is the real miracle. Although it is wrapped in a tragedy because we want to taste every one of them. Thank you, thank you. You're too kind. What I'm really dying to hear about is what you two ladies have been up to all these years, aside being hot cougars. Oh, I don't know about being a cougar, but I've been busy with work and Alma, has been busy with other things. I've been busy aging gracefully. How's that? What? How are you aging gracefully? You just relax. You should try it. It's like magic. Speaking of someone developing nicely and coming into his own star shine, young Percy here has been writing short stories. So talented, just like his father. Well Could we hear one of your stories? Thanks Dad. Just kinda weird about this stuff. Sorry, I wasn't aware. There's no reason to feel self-conscious. Yes! Percy, we would love to hear what you've been working on. I've got one here with me, but it's a little graphic. Is it violent? Mostly sexual. Oh, fine by me. Although Alma might have to cover her ears in the juicy parts. I am a grown woman. I can take whatever you throw at me, man. Okay. Consider yourself warned. Marvin smelled home in the sheets yet the bed was half empty. He had been lying awake and alone most of the night wondering where his wife Caroline could be. Perhaps she had disappeared to her friend Maggie's house whom she often stayed with when they were fighting. He knew the number, but it was too late to call. His eyes fluttered in the darkness and his mind journeyed somewhere he knew it should not go. The memory of his darling Caroline cheating on him with a man named Jerome Peterson. Jerome was 6 ft 8 and weighed 250 pounds. It was a night just like this one, actually it had what Marvin thought was a lover's quarrel. Logical deduction had brought him to the conclusion that Jerome Peterson's penis was well over twice the size of his own and he wondered how it could possibly fit in Caroline's tiny vagina. Sorry to interrupt Percy but, are the characters in your story based on actual people that you know? Yes. Please continue. Thank you. He knew the only way out of this mental torture chamber was persistent violent masturbation to an almost inconceivable degree. Alright, alright, alright. I think we get the picture. Don't get me wrong, dear boy. Though it lacks subtlety, taste and style, the freedom you've achieved, almost bravery is astonishing and certainly, commendable. Brave. And revealing. And I'd like to hear the rest of the story sometime. Thank you. It'd be my pleasure. And now, according to the European custom it is time for the salad. Unlike in America, where the salad comes barbarously, in my opinion, before the meal. Percy, created this concoction on his own and I think it's quite original. Bon Appétit. I was hesitant to tell this next story in front of Percy, but since he has set such a sterling standard of artistic freedom, I might as well. This salad is boss. Mmm, really delicious. We'll have to talk about the recipe. I'd be happy to. Thank you. This story, is about another kind of infinity what philosophers call, a bad infinity. I was in Paris, not recently but years ago when I was in my 20s, and a group of friends of mine and I decided to visit the cemetery Père Lachaise. As clueless and young literary students often will do, we also thought it was a good idea, to drop acid. That's intense. Dad, I had no idea. Do you like it? Mmm, I'm getting to that. So I was thinking about Baudelaire Wesley, are you alright? I'll be fine, excuse me. And the inversion of artistic val- values is, is kinda like kinda like a revenge on Is there garlic in this? Oh my God, yes, in the dressing. I'm so sorry. Forgot about your allergy entirely. Goddammit! Goddammit! Get him some water! Goddammit! I'm more than embarrassed! I don't even know what to say. Percy! I thought I... spanked you enough as a child. Want me to spank you now? Why would you do this? It's just a joke. I want you to go out from this house! Still selling the cabin. You wouldn't dare! Of course I would. All you got tonight is what's been coming to you, old man. I wish you more of the same. Goodnight. Shut the door! Shut the goddamn door! Hey! He's cheating! I'm not cheating, what are you talking about? That settles our business. Cheating! I have revealed my true nature, Alma. Now you understand who I am. Why have you entered the darkness, Alma? Do you find it alone here? Is there a way in, or out? You have arrived, my dear. Goddammit. Damn it all to hell. Hello? Hi, Rose. No, I'm fine. You're gonna come tomorrow? No, that's great. Just sudden. So looks like Rose is coming for a visit. Really? Oh, that's great. When? Tomorrow. Wow! That's wonderful. I wasn't sure where the two of you stood. We're just fine. Well I'm glad. You know, you two will have so much to do together with that baby coming and all. God, I wouldn't get too excited about it. Excited about what? The baby! There's no baby. She's not even pregnant yet. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to be happy about my niece potentially having a child. You're excited, because you never had a baby. You probably resent me for being a mother. You're gonna resent Rose too, if and when she's a mother. That's ridiculous. And that's insulting. And it's just not true. I'm not gonna argue with you about it. Where's all this animosity coming from anyway? Oh wait. It's because of Wesley isn't it? - What? No. - No, that's it. Even at this age, you're still so immature. To be honest with you, I think Wesley's behavior last night was fucking weird. And I think there's something wrong with him. Weird because he has an allergy? No, not that. Oh, okay then. Sounds to me like you're just making it up because God forbid he took an interest in me and not you. I really don't care who he takes an interest in. I got a bad feeling about it. You know, you are a real piece of work. I don't know if Elizabeth and I will ever get along. Yeah, I got a brother. Haven't talked to him in seven years. It's a fucked up situation. I bet. Hey BJ, you remember what you said about Wesley? What about him? I decided I definitely don't like him. I think there's something wrong with him. Ahh, fuck him. Can't explain it. Happened all of a sudden. I don't think he's one of us. What do you mean, you don't think he gets high? Definitely not. But no I mean, you look at that man long enough, hard enough, just close enough you'll see there's a few tell-tale signs that he got a lot of darkness. - Aunt Liz! - Oh Rose! My favorite niece! You're only niece. And hence my favorite, come on in. This is crazy. I haven't been here in so long. Oh, it's all the same. The only thing that's changed is ourselves. So, Alma tells me you're starting a family. She told you that? Wow. Well, yes. We've been talking about it and we are headed in that direction. Well, that is great. Yeah, the clock is ticking, as they say. It's a big step for you. Thanks, I know. Thomas has been really good about helping me move on from my past. And I'm out of that place and I finally feel responsible enough to take on that kind of life change. It's been five years. That's amazing. I am so proud of you It's nothing to be proud of. Take me that long just to learn how to live like a normal person again but I appreciate it, and I also appreciate how great you look! Oh, please. I look like Big Bird. You're the one who's glowing. No, you've always been so beautiful. I just hope that I'm half the fox you are whenever I'm your age. Hi Rose. Hi Mom. Whole lobsters with jello salad and diced yams. Ladies. Forgive me. I'm sorry to be late. The muse has her own demands. Quite alright. We just sat down. Were you able to get much writing done? I was, thank you. Wesley. This is Rose. Ahh, Rose. Forgive me if I speak too directly but you look now as she did then. A radiant sun on your own. Wow, you weren't lying when you said he had a silver tongue. My mother was very beautiful. So that's high praise. I can take a compliment whenever I find one. Wesley, I've heard plenty about you over the years. You have a son, who's also a writer. Yes, my Percy. What can I say, I'm flattered that he has decided to follow in my footsteps. Where? Did he go? Alma! He had commitments in the city. Perhaps another time. Rose has always been a fascinating, young woman. She attended Julliard for dance. Ballet or modern? Mainly modern. I can't say that I've gotten much use out of my degree since I got married. But dancing used to be my thing. Oh, she was brilliant! And she worked so hard at it too. Oh, and Tom? He is such a nice boy. It's a shame he couldn't come. This is just a short visit. And they're planning on having a child. Oh my God! It's okay, Mom. It's just a matter of time at this point because it's already been discussed. My fear about dancing is that if I ever got the bug back, it would be difficult if I wanted to teach or something. Thomas has always wanted lots of kids and I have to say, I like the sound of that. Well, I hope you two find a happy medium. Marriage is, after all, an exercise in compromise. But of course, the heart wants what the heart wants. Oh, you say that phrase too. I probably use it too much. Oh, Rose. Tell us about the house you renovated, hmm? Well of course, Thomas couldn't have just an ordinary home, because that would be too easy. He had to have this old retro-styled home that he did so much work. I kept telling that it was gonna be years before we could get into that house and we'll probably have children by that time and it's going to be difficult shuffling kids around and moving back Wesley had long forgotten that familiar feeling that possessed him that evening. Rose's beauty was unmatched. Enough to light a fire in his heart. My sister. My child. How sweet to dream we lived there as lovers do. To kiss as we choose. To love and to dream in that land resembling you. Wesley, would you like to go for a walk with me? I feel like getting out. Oh! Of course. Great. - I - never get to do this. What's that? Just walk, and enjoy the night air. You probably work too much. That's the impression I get. That's probably true. I've always been busy. And I've always enjoyed the colder weather. Alma would say it was because I had a cold heart. I don't think you have a cold heart Elizabeth. Maybe it's only sleeping. Oh, thank you kind sir. I think it's starting to warm up. I think it's wonderful the way that you and Alma have remained so close. It's sad. I'm really all she has. Especially now that Rose has her own life. I hate to think what Rose's having a baby is going to do to Alma's mental state. What do you mean? Alma has problems. Lots of neurological problems. Psychosomatic symptoms. She's a psychiatrist's gold mine, kind of a walking pharmacy. I was not aware. She does a very good job at hiding it. Especially around people she's trying to impress. But then of course, the people who love her like Rose and I, we have to come in and pick up the pieces when she falls apart. I had no idea her condition was so serious. Oh, I shouldn't have said anything. I don't mean to paint her in a negative light. Often we take our mind for granted. It's only human to depend on it. It can be impossible to set loose our demons even at the moment of death. I'm terrified of death. But I'm even more terrified of being alone. You are not alone, dear Elizabeth. I don't know why I'm opening up to you like this. Maybe it's your heart speaking, now that it's waking up. Maybe so. You don't need to resign yourself to becoming accustomed to being cold. And you don't need to look away from me as if looking at me is something dangerous. As I've noticed. I also noticed that spirit in those eyes of yours. Sometimes, it appears to be frolicking in a distant land unknown to you. I have always loved the dancing glory in your eyes, dear Elizabeth. And I've always enjoyed the way you insist on looking into them. Mom, you can't do what you're doing. I know what you're going on about. I'm fine. You can't live here. I've always found it peaceful here. Of course it's peaceful here, it's a vacation property. You can't live on vacation. I need a vacation. Does Elizabeth know that you've been here for two years? And that you sold the condo in the city? She will only judge. She will be right to judge. Maybe the two of you could get together. And you could start a judging club. We're just looking out for you. When was the last time you saw a doctor instead of self-medicating? I knew that was coming. I was just waiting for it. "Mom's crazy, let's get her some help". I don't need to see any doctors, as long as I'm out here. Mom, you're alone out here. It's not true. I have Otis. And BJ. BJ Beavers? Mom, Otis is a dog. And BJ Beavers is just a little crazier that you are. Well there you have it. Why did you make it so hard to love you? To care about you, huh? I can see why Dad gave up. You know, of all of the hateful things that you've said tonight, that takes the cake. I'm sorry. But I'm not sorry. You need to hear it. What I need, is for the two of you to stay out of my fucking business. You're deteriorating right in front of us and no one can do anything about it because you won't let us. I have bad blood. And what can you say about that, huh? It is what it is. You realize that doesn't even mean anything, right? Where have you been? I was out walking with Wesley. Is that something we should be celebrating? Why are you glowing? Because he was kind to me Alma. Do you remember what that was like? Being kind to someone? I told you, I had reservations about him and you went out with him anyway. My God, I don't need your permission. Your jealousy is making you insane. A man comes around here and notices me for a change. You are making an ass of yourself in front of your own daughter. This is still the visit I have planned. You have lost your goddamn mind Alma. You need help. Professional help. This is not even about Wesley any more. This is about you and your little fucking machinations. You're sick! You caused quite a stir around here, Mr. Wesley. It's in my nature, I suppose. Aren't you going to invite me in? Well, no. Do you have plans to behave yourself? Don't be ridiculous. I've always wondered what this place looks like on the inside. Can I offer you a drink? Certainly. I'll have whatever you're having. You don't strike me as much of a need enthusiast. Perhaps, a glass of sensair. That's fine too. Whatever. Your mother and your aunt are lovely women. You come from good stock. You should be thankful for them. Should I? They both care about you a great deal. Hmm. I don't think that it's me that they care about. I think it's you. You must know that they're both in love with you. That surprises me. I haven't done anything to warrant their affections. Although I would be happy to reap them in a manner of speaking. I don't think either of them deserve you. I used to be a drug addict. But I bet they didn't tell you that either. No, they did not. They like to fill people's minds with rainbows and kitty cats whenever it comes to a family. No one's perfect, my dear Well, you seem to have that pretty well figured out. If only you knew what my son Percy thinks of me. Oh, I'm sad that I didn't get to meet him. Is he as charismatic as you? Sadly, no. I'm afraid it is not in his blood. He must take after his mother. He takes after someone. I saw you looking at me. When? At the table. I saw the way you were looking at me. Forgive me if my gaze lingered too long on you. It's not often that I am confronted with such a marvel. I didn't mean to stare. But you remind me so much of your mother when we were children. Did you fuck her? - Your mother? - Mmm. No, no I did not. Why not? You must've thought she was pretty enough. The fates did not smile on us that way. Are you going to fuck my aunt? For such a bright young woman, I find you crudely inquisitive. I've never had a problem getting answers. What are you waiting on, Mr. Wesley? Rose left without saying goodbye. She probably got tired of our bickering. I would've left too. Yet you're still here. Seeing Wesley tonight. Yeah, well you shouldn't. Not doing that again. BJ thinks there's something not right about him. He's changed. I'm not sure he's even human. You have lost your goddamn mind, Alma. I have seen this coming for years, ever since your divorce. But now, I don't even know what to say. You are sick. I'm extending my stay and we are going to see the doctor tomorrow. I don't need to see a doctor, man. No, no. You got Doctor BJ Beavers across the street. He can diagnose you. He can fill your head with ghouls and goblins and aliens, whatever else you wanna believe. And all the while, your mind, your mind's disintegrating Alma to the point where you're gonna end up in a mental institution. But you're already in one, aren't you? This cabin. It's your own private insane asylum. Yeah, that's right. Rose told me you sold the condo? Sick about that, I wish you would've told me I would've helped you. Well, this is my cabin too. And I'm going to insist that you get the fuck out of it. You can't fucking make me leave. Roast chicken with pastry and deviled eggs with shrimp garnish. Angel or siren spirit. I don't care. As long as velvet eyes and perfumed head and glimmering motions, so my queen can make the world less dreadful and the time less dead. That's beautiful. Thank you. It's Baudelaire, from Les Fleurs du mal. And of course, you have all these memorized? They're easy to remember. I imagine everything is easy for you Wesley. I suppose that you're curious about why I invited you here this evening. I think I have a good idea. Well, as enticing as you appear I'm a little hesitant to divulge to you the true nature of our little soiree. You don't go to many soirees do you. On the contrary, I had been host to some of the most extravagant revels in all of France. Really. No, not really. I'm, I'm afraid you're right about me and the parties. There's no need to be afraid. And I'm right about a lot of things. Yes. Elizabeth, tonight has evolved into a Ménage à trois. There is someone, that I would like you to meet. Oh. Oh my God. Is that your wife? Elizabeth, may I present, my Genevieve. Behold, this is the first time that she has been able to walk in years. I had her discharged and delivered here earlier this evening after a surprise phone call from the hospital. Wesley, this is a shock. She can dine with us. We'll have to assist her of course. Would you mind trying to help feed her while I pour us more wine? It is superb to have her back with us again. The doctors say she will continue to improve over time. Of course, her mind will never recover. I have a feeling that the bad blood will slowly but surely, evacuate from her system. I haven't phoned Percy yet. But I imagine he will be thrilled with the news. And to recovery. Wesley, I think I should go and leave you alone with your wife. Nonsense, she's not even cognitive. Yes, but don't you think this is a little odd? Elizabeth, if this makes you uncomfortable you and I could return to another room. The only way through the heart is with a wooden stake. That's what I was told. Never killed anything before. I have. The other day it was a snake. Saw it laying there in a dormant state so I snuck up behind it, stabbed it right in the back of the head. Popped its head off. How'd that make you feel? Good. I hate snakes. This Wesley, you gotta look at him like he's a snake. You come up into that place with something in your mind, he's gonna see it. He'll know you're there to kill him. I already thought of that. Creatures of the night are malignant species. They don't love the same things we love, Alma. They don't have love for love itself. A lot of people can't get into the feelings of a hunter. But that's exactly what you're gonna have to do. Then I better get prepared. Where are you going, Alma? Tonight, he walks as one of the living dead. It's inconceivable to me, that you've never married. All men are assholes, Wesley. I'd imagine you already knew that. Not all men. Can I confess something to you? Please. When you invited me over here tonight, I thought I had won. Won what? Because you were always so much closer with Alma growing up, I didn't think I had a chance. And then you started paying attention to me for whatever reason. I thought I had won. You truly are, unpredictable. I was foolish. My feelings for you are my heart's truth, Elizabeth. I wish you weren't such a perfect man. We're halves of the same whole. You are the very image of perfection. Okay, yeah, no, no. I can't do this. - What is the matter? - No, this isn't right. I can't do this with you, not with her here. It isn't right. It's disrespectful. It's weird. It's wrong. You can't go. I can't do this. This is too much. - No, you cannot leave. - Wesley, please let me go! Now, listen. Calm down, take a breath and listen to me. I know you want this. And if at anytime, my company displeases you, just remember that there's only you who is to blame. Cherry, cherry cheese pie. Wesley? Wesley? Alma? I brought a pie. Your favorite. A cherry, cherry cheese pie. You remembered! Thank you. It was my pleasure. My goodness! I thought Elizabeth was here. Alma, I know that you and your sister had had a sort of rivalry, and I just want you to know that I would not do anything to come between you. There's nothing coming between me and my sister, man. Wait, but she said there was, kind of a competition. There's no competition. Fair enough. Sorry I brought it up. I know what you are. Oh? I know exactly what you are. I know your little tricks. I know your little games. And I want you to tell me right now, where the hell my sister is? Alma, I don't think I appreciate your tone. You killed her, didn't you? Are you stoned? You drank her blood, because that's what you do. That's exactly what you do. And, "oh Rose, you're so beautiful". That is my daughter! What? I got it, didn't I? You're a freak. Admit it. You're a goddamn vampire. And you look, fucking stupid. Alma, listen to me. Your daughter and your sister are very concerned about you. You need to seek some kind of professional help. You are not with us. I know that what I feel is real. I'm sure you believe that but you're not clear and everyone can see it except you. Honestly, you're wrong. And you, are an evil, evil man. I'm evil? You seriously believe that I am evil? Yeah, with every fiber of my being. You know why I chose Elizabeth? I don't care. Because she is stronger than you. And more interesting in every way. You are weak. Alma You might be the weakest person that I have ever known. And you would die without Elizabeth and Rose just like you died after your divorce. Your kind is always marked for the harvest, ripe for the feasting by those of us far, far superior to you. You, will always be, the hunted! As for me, I will always be the What'd you say Wesley? What did you say, little bitch? What the hell did you do, Alma? Oh my God! Jesus fucking Christ. You finally lost your fucking mind. What did you do, Alma?! Alma. You two ladies need any help? You! You stay away from us! You've done nothing but ruin my sister's mind! Look at this! Do you see this? This is what you've done! You've caused a man to die tonight! Go away! Alma. Alma! Everyone needs a witness. And you'll be witness to this. Witness to what? She shines for you now, Elizabeth.
