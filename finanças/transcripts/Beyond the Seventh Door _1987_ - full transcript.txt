(eerie music) (suspenseful music) (nostalgic music) - Let's go sit on the back. Excuse me, excuse me. Two coffees, please. How are you, Wendy? - I'm fine. - Are you still, are we still... - You just don't get it, do you, Boris? I explained everything in my letter. You got my letter, didn't you? - Yeah, yeah, I got your letter. But, I don't believe it. - Believe it. What is it you want? - [Boris] You. - You scare me, Boris - And, Breston, doesn't he scare you? - Why should Breston scare me? - [Boris] Would you live with me if I have a castle? - Once. Without a castle, without anything. I was so blind, Boris, I had so many dreams for the future, our future. - And, now? - I'm getting on with my own life. And, you are no longer part of it. - Oh, come on, Wendy. - [Wendy] Do you know how many times you promised me you'd get a job? Do you know how many? - I was getting... - Robbery isn't a job. - I needed a stake to get the start. - You were lucky, Boris. Lucky they caught you. God knows where it would've stopped. - Alright, look, I served my time. I paid my debt. Now I'm clean. I'm clean. - [Wendy] Good. That's really good, Boris. I hope you stay that way. And, I hope you stay away from me. - But, do you remember how they got me? You do remember, don't you, Wendy? My getaway driver panicked. Took off. Left me only to beg. Didn't you bother? - Boris, leave me alone. - [Boris] Help me, Wendy, just this one job. - You want a job, I'll talk to someone. - [Boris] Wendy. - What is it you want from me? - Just this one time, I never bother you again. Never. There must be something with all those story about hidden treasures of the Lord Breston. - Alright. What's on your mind? - Case the place. Where he might keep it. How it's guarded. Are there alarms? Where are the switches to turn them off? We need keys, combinations. Wendy, you're right in the inside this time. We can't miss. (mysterious music) (wind blowing) (suspenseful music) (heels thumping) - Boris, come on. Come on. - Sure it's cool now? - I couldn't make it any earlier. I had to wait 'til everyone went to their rooms. - The boss? - [Wendy] He's sleeping. What if he wakes up? Good girl. This is it? - I tried everything. All week I've looked. Under, over and everywhere. Nothing, any treasure in this place, it's got to be here. - Here? - [Wendy] I watched him very carefully. When he thinks no ones around, he takes an elevator into the foundation of the castle, which is the same place this probably goes. - Probably goes. Why don't we just take the elevator? - I tried, I can't get the door open. - I think this doesn't look right. Probably, it's just a cellar. - With a lock on it? - It's locked, it doesn't mean anything. - Look, this is a copy. He keeps the original around his neck. Would you keep a key to a cellar around your neck? - Come on. (eerie music) Stay close. - I told you this must be it. What do you think we'll find? - I don't know. Maybe, the corpses of unfaithful servants. - Very funny. - It's a Waldheim. - Can you open it? - Maybe. - [Wendy] Well? (suspenseful music) - Okay. Let's go. (heels thumping) (beeping) - [Lord Breston] Welcome to my chambers of terror. Whoever you are. But, of course, I know what you are. You are a thief. A burglar who has trespassed on my property with the obvious intention of robbing me. To steal my famous treasure that the Lords of Breston have carefully guarded for two centuries. So, go ahead, get it. To make things more interesting and in the spirit of sportsmanship, you may keep that which you find. So, my friend, it seems you now have only one choice, to continue on. Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to give you 20 seconds. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) It's locked. - Come on, we're wasting time. We only got 20 seconds. - Fast. (heels thumping) - Boris, another door. - It's closing. Damn. Are you okay? - [Wendy] No. - What the hell you wearing? You people had some kind of costume party up there? - You mean this? It's my working uniform. - [Boris] You look like a hooker. - This is how Lord Breston want's me dressed. - I wonder why. - Because he's a pervert. He's rich, he can afford it and enjoy it. - Enjoy to what? The creep is paralyzed from the waist down. - He can enjoy things by observing. Besides, his hands aren't paralyzed. - What does that mean? - It means he enjoys placing his hands all over me. - Oh, does he pay you extra for that? - Come on, Boris, give me a break. If it wasn't for you, I'd be living a normal life. You know damn well I had to accept this kind of job to live. You left me with nothing but bills. - Okay, enough. I have enough. I have enough of this. I have enough of you. I have enough of everything. I tried. - You tried. But, they caught you. Face it, Boris, you're not even a good thief. - I'm getting better. See, the Breston said, what we find, we can keep. - How can you still be thinking about money at a time like this? - Let's go. (heels thumping) Got to be here. - [Lord Breston] Congratulations. You can now try to open the next door to continue on or you may stay where you are and die peacefully. Now, count on your wisdom and you just might get out of here. - That's it? Speak up, you bastard. There is no bloody way we're going to die in here. See, the guy in jail showed me how to do this. (beeping) (beeping) (beeping) (ringing) (ticking) I just don't understand. I don't understand. - I'm wondering what he meant by his last words. He, somehow, emphasized count on your wisdom. - You mean, you mean, all those words mean some kind of special significance? - He said count. Why not? You got a pen? Count on your wisdom. Five. Two. Four. Six. Try it. - Five. Two. Four. Six. (clicking) Did you hear something? A click? Let's go. What the hell is this? - Trouble. (beeping) (humming) (banging) - No! (thumping) Shit! Shit! This guy is clever. What now? - [Lord Breston] My father wears a ring. If properly spelled, my name will bring the solution that you need. - That's it, that's all it is? - We have to figure it out. - And, what we win if we do? - Our lives would be nice. - I'm wondering what's gonna happen if we step on one of those skulls. - I don't think we wanna find out. There's only one way out of here, Boris. We've got to solve this puzzle. - Yeah. Now, let's think. Who could wear such a ring? - Remember the Vagner's Opera? Dare or was it Dust Rhinegold? - Sure, we got opera night once a week in jail. - No. That can't be it. What about the Lord of the Rings? - [Boris] Who the hell was he? - No. That can't be it either. - Wendy, look. There is no letter 'Z', 'W', 'K', 'M', 'V'. - Which means? - [Boris] Well, it makes our job of guessing easier. - You got any ideas? - [Boris] What about Saturn? - What about it? - Planet Saturn wears a ring and it's a father of his moons. - Which one? - Astronomy's not my strong suit. - You don't have a strong suit, Boris. - Look, I drop out from grade 10. You finished school, you go to the opera, you figure out. - Let's see. There was a Titan. Fobo. Or, Foboth. Janus and, I think, Tethys. - Forget a Tethys. There is no letter 'Y'. - It could be Janus, couldn't it? - What gives you that idea? - Look, the 'J' is right in the front line. The other four are around it. - Yeah, it could be Janus. - Look, it even spells the name clearly. J, A, N, U, S. It's got to be Janus. What do you think? - You might be right. Okay, stay back. (grinding) (crackling) (grinding) I think you are right. (thumping) Christ! Guy's crazy! Doesn't appear to be Janus, does it? - You were right. - No! (suspenseful music) It's not either Tethys or Titan. There's only one 'T'. - How about Rhea? - Spell it. - R, H, E, A. - R-H E-A. Yeah. It's possible. Stay back. - Careful, Boris. (humming) - What's that? - What? - That strange humming. (grinding) - The wall, it's closing in on us. - [Boris] Help! (whimpering) - Step behind me on the 'J'. (beeping) (sizzling) - That was close. What now? - [Wendy] I don't know. We've tried everything. Unless... - [Boris] Unless what? Maybe, he means the other Saturn. The one from Roman mythology. The real Saturn, Saturn the God. - Go on. - He was the God of Harvest and he had children. - And? - [Wendy] And, among them, Juno, the Goddess of Marriage. That's why the 'J' is safe. Juno. - J, U, N, O. Could be, it could be Juno. Okay, follow me, quickly. (suspenseful music) This is last letter. (humming) Jump, Wendy, quickly. (ticking) (beeping) (humming) (lockng) (clicking) Not again. - Do you think there's more? - I don't know. (grinding) - The shaft. - No! Fuck! - It's hopeless. We'll never get out of here. - What now? Say something. - It's a recording, Boris, it can't hear you. - [Lord Breston] You are doing very well. You decoded my little quiz. But, from now on, there will be no more hints, my friend. The time has come for your real problems. You have only five minutes to solve this chamber. - Five minutes to solve what? - There must be another passage somewhere. - To solve what? (suspenseful music) Maybe, maybe on the, maybe on the floor. (knocking) - [Lord Breston] Four minutes. - Four more minutes, Boris. - I heard that. - Come on. (knocking) (suspenseful music) There's nothing. - [Lord Breston] Three minutes. - Come on. (knocking) The walls, maybe. - What the walls? - Try them. (exciting music) (banging) - It's a solid concrete. - Maybe not everywhere. - What do you mean, everywhere, it's a full house. What do you mean? Why you stand, why don't you help me? - I'm scared, I don't know what to do. - [Boris] I'm scared, too. I'm scared, too. Do something. - [Lord Breston] Two minutes. - Oh, God. - Come on, Boris. (suspenseful music) - [Lord Breston] Sorry, my friend, your time is almost up. You have only 60 seconds to live. - Screw you. Screw you, you heard that? Screw you. (rattling) (exciting music) I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. (rattling) - Boris, look! - Stop (mumbling). (banging) Something here. Come and look. (yelling) Come on. Come on. - [Lord Breston] Well, well. You certainly are living proof that a man in grave danger is capable of doing things that are, otherwise, beyond his power and abilities. However, like all who enter another's home by force, you must be prepared to risk danger. Perhaps, being maimed by a guard dog. Or, even killed by an enraged owner. I am only exercising my right to protect myself, my possessions and the sanctity of my home. Think of this while you are awaiting your end. It might help you in another life. The one after death. - That's it? - There was no clue. - Okay, calm down. - He's right. We shouldn't be here in the first place. - Stop moralizing, Wendy. We have to outthink this guy. - And, what are we supposed to do? - Nothing that he expects. - What do you mean by that? - See these two corners? He want us to go and check what is behind them. - You smoke too much. - Okay, I'll quit, I promise, if I live. - I'm going to see. - Don't, that's exactly what he want us to do. Don't play into his hands. - There's no other way, Boris. Someone has got to go and see. - Then, let me go first, okay. I put you in this mess and I'll take you out from here. - I'll get myself out of this mess. (heels thumping) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - No! (screaming) Wendy! Talk to me, Wendy! (screaming) - Boris! - [Boris] Wendy! Where are you? Are you alright? - Boris, help me out of here, please. - Don't panic, Wendy! - A body. A dead man, Boris. - Don't look at him. Calm down. Where are you? - I'm in another chamber. A new chamber. With holes in the walls. - [Boris] Holes? - Yeah. It's all wet down here. - [Boris] The holes, Wendy. Tell me about the holes. - There's lots. They're everywhere. - Wendy, the dead man. - No, I don't wanna look. - You must! - It looks like he coulda drowned. I don't know. - That's it? Is there any drain somewhere? - Yeah, there is. - Listen, Wendy, don't panic. Is there anything else there? Door? Or passage, any way out? - There's a metallic plate fastened to the wall. The exit could be behind it. I don't know. There looks to be a few screws around it. But, some are missing. - Poor guy must have started unscrewing them. But, he didn't have the time. There must be some screwdriver around somewhere. On the ground. - No, not on the ground. It's in his hand. He has one in his hand. - I'm coming down. - No, Boris, don't. - Why not? - We have to go back. - Wendy, we can't go back. There is no way back. Listen to me, start unscrewing the plate. (suspenseful music) - I got one, should I continue? - I don't know. Yeah, go ahead but be careful. (beeping) - Oh no! - What is it? - This one's longer than all the others. - I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Stop it, Wendy, stop right now. (suspenseful music) - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I heard. (ticking) - Boris, are you there? - Where the hell would I go? - Boris, what should I do? - I don't know. How many screws are left? - 20, 30, I don't know, I don't think I could do it. - Of course you can. Just take your time. (water flowing) (suspenseful music) - Boris, water's pouring in. - Don't panic, Wendy. Can you climb back up? - No, it's too high and smooth. There's nothing to grab onto. - Wait, I have an extension cord, I'll pull you out. You better plug the hole. - With what? - [Boris] With anything. Your dress. Do something to stop the water. (rock and roll music) - Boris, hurry! - I'm trying, I'm trying! - Boris, the water's rising! - I got it. - Boris, help me! - Alright, alright, I got it. - It's too short. - How short? - I don't know. It's too short. - You got now? - I can't. - Come on, Wendy, you can do it! Grab it! - I got it, I got it, Boris. Pull me up. - Hold it. I can't, the cord is gonna break. - What do you mean? - Just stay there. - It's cold in here, Boris. - I know, hang on. - What time is it? - Five past two, the water should be gone soon. - How do you know? - Just think what's waiting for us in the last chamber. - Yeah. - Hey, how you doing, kid? - I'm freezing and my legs are numb. - Hey, keep talking about your legs. I never realized how sexy those legs are. You are going to make hell of a actress. - Thanks, Boris, that's just great. Beautiful, frozen legs. - Hey, I don't wanna hear that. What about people who swim out in the freezing water? (beeping) (ticking) - Boris! - What? - I can't feel my legs anymore and I'm losing the feeling in my arms. - Hang on. Give it a few minutes. The water will drain out soon. - Oh, God, (whispering). (humming) - What is that noise? - Boris, it's the water, it's draining. - That's it, kid. You can't give up now. Not now, you hear me? (humming) (water sloshing) Are you alright? - I'm okay. - Good. I'm coming down. - No, not yet, let the water finish draining first. (sighing) (thumping) - I'm coming down now. - I'm so cold, I'm okay. - I'll get us out from here, I promise you. (huffing) It's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (shivering) Warmer? Feel better? - [Wendy] Yeah. - It's okay, it's alright. It's okay, it's alright. - Boris, Boris, what are you doing? Boris, stop it. Please. - Baby, it's working. - Boris, don't. God, you're crazy. - I know. I'm crazy about you. - Oh, Boris, make love to me. (romantic music) (wind blowing) - Okay, I'll start unscrewing the plate. You just stay close by the cord. Just in case. - Okay. (suspenseful music) Be careful, Boris. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - I can't believe it. This is it. - [Lord Breston] Well, well. My congratulations. And, now you've come to claim that for which you risked your life. There is $1,000,000 in that briefcase. However, you could decide to leave it where it is and simply walk out of here as an honest man. For behind this last door, the seventh door, you will find treasure that is far more valuable. (suspenseful music) - What do you think? - I wouldn't touch it. It's probably his deadliest trap. - Wendy, we came this far. - Boris, let's just get out of here. - First, let me see what's behind this door. - Boris, we're free to go. Let's get outta here. - It's elevator. I wonder what he meant by treasure far more precious behind seven door. - Freedom. If we leave now, we'll have our freedom. - Whatever we do, police waiting for us. - We'll tell them about the corpse. Boris, use your head. He's letting us go. - Okay. Okay. If you're right, this elevator is gonna take us up. And, door will open. - There, you see, it's empty. Let's go, Boris, now before it's too late. - I can't just leave this without checking. - Boris, get in, forget about the money. - Wendy, let me just look. It's real. - Of course, it's real. He wants you to grab it. Remember what you told me? Don't play into his hands. - But, why would he blow up all this money? - Because he's incredibly rich. And, you are incredibly stupid. - All this money? Don't give up now. It's set up, alright. - Then, let's go. - Not yet. It's wired to something. (blowing) I'll empty it anyway. - But, you aren't going to. - Okay, we'll go. But, not without a couple of bundles to cover our expenses. - Boris, please, you promised. (humming) - Wendy, we earned this with hard pay. - You are so lucky. - Where do you think we are? - The secret entrance is a camouflage door. It's built into the paneling of the third floor. But, I'm not exactly sure now. - Okay, check it out, I'll grab the light. (suspenseful music) - It's okay. I'll let you out through the kitchen door downstairs. And, then I'll switch the alarm on again. We're on the third floor. - Okay, wait, wait. Take this money. Go to your room, change your clothes and wait for me there. - Boris. - Do what I told you. Don't worry. Where's your room? - Third door to the left but Boris. - Leave the door open so I can find you. - Boris, please, don't go back. Come on, come to my room. Please, we'll make love. - Okay. We will. We will. For rest of our lives. In Bermuda. The French Riviera. (mumbling) - Okay. Okay, just go, okay. Do what I told you. - Boris. You idiot. (suspenseful music) (humming) - Okay, Mr. Breston, I came for what is mine. (heels thumping) (suspenseful music) (water flowing) (bomb exploding) (buzzing) - Why so sad, my dear? We both gave him a chance. - He was only 36. - He was a crook. The wrong man for a girl like you. He would've found a way to get himself killed sooner or later. They all do. Here. For your trouble. 20,000, as agreed. Take it, you've earned it. Gave me great pleasure to listen to your performance tonight. You would've made a hell of an actress. Next time, as we discussed, I'll double it. (buzzing) And, Wendy, one more thing. You really don't have to make love to all of them, do you? (buzzing) (ticking) (dialing) - Peter. I've thought it over. Yeah. I've got the key. Yeah. Tomorrow night will be perfect. Bye. (suspenseful music)
