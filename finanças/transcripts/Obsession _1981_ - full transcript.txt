[music playing] [chatter] Some day I'll understand. Some day. "Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"? Ugh. "Body Shop." Nah. "Bed of Satin." Three X's. That's it. Who goes? Odds. Even. You. You want to go, I'll-- No, no, no. You won, you go. [chatter] Oh such tinkling voices, dainty [inaudible]. [laughter] WOMAN (IN FILM): You're a sadist, that's what you are, a sadist. Please, what are you doing in the closet? Come out! Oh, I don't believe it. MAN (IN FILM): [inaudible]. WOMAN (IN FILM): Look, satin. Did you ever do it on satin? Oh. I like that. Oh, I feel so-- Here, take some of mine. WOMAN (IN FILM): [moaning] Oh, do it, do it. No, don't stop. Oh, oh yes. Oh, oh yes. That's it. Oh, no! Yes! No, no, yes. Yes. Oh yes! Boy, must be a porno "Gone With the Wind." I can't bear those films. There's nothing erotic about those films, nothing. Get off it. You've never even seen a dirty movie. But I have. Oh yeah, where? In Italy. You're such a liar. My cousin showed me one. It was so ugly. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Did I snore? Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here? Excuse me. As a matter of fact, how did I? Hi, Dad. Hi, Sarah. Smitty and Ruspoli upstairs? Yeah, they're in your room. Thanks. How was school? Obscene. Good. Obscene! Good, good. MRS. NORTON: Is that you, Sarah? Hi, Mom. MRS. NORTON: Hi darling. Hey, those are my [inaudible] jeans. I got a pair too. And don't say they're too tight. You're supposed to be my mother, remember? I've got a great ass for a girl my age. You're crazy. You aren't waiting for me, by any chance? I want to hear about that movie, shot for shot. Don't rush me. Hi, Lieutenant. Hi, kid. Shot for shot. Well, first I want you to swear upon this Bible-- That's not a Bible, that's the Oxford Dictionary of Verse. It'll do. We'll remain a sworn secret between us and us alone, so help you god. Now swear I never went to that movie. You never went to that movie. OK. [chatter] PAUL: What is that supposed to-- no, you tell me. Forget it. Sarah, I don't need to hear that, all right? And I'll tell you something else. Forget it. [inaudible] All right. Forget -- I don't need you running my life. All the time you-- where are you going? Hey, hey, wait a minute. I don't need you every minute of the day to tell me what I got to do. I do what I like. You didn't pay for your schnitzel sandwich. Does he have something contagious? Can I sit for a minute? Sure. May I? Haven't we-- Yeah. Right! You're the dirty old man. My name is Ashley St. Clair. Now that's a name right out of "Gone With the Wind." Miss? Can I offer you something? Cappuccino, please. Boyfriend trouble? Not anymore. Love isn't easy, is it? Oh, brother. No. Well. You couldn't be a dirty old man. How would you know? You slept through the best parts. Thank you. How old are you,l anyway? - How old are you? - 16. 60. 60? Excuse me. Like one? I'm crazy about them. I know you! You're the painter, you're Ashley St. Clair, right? That's what I said. Ashley St. Clair. Intense. Like, how much would you charge to paint me? I haven't painted in ten years. Why not? I mean, what do you do? Spend a lot of time on a boat, worrying about why I haven't painted for ten years. Well, I think you should paint. It'll keep you out of dirty movies. What about you? That was my first one. No, I mean what do you do? I go to school at Marybourne, very chi-chi. And I write. Little prose things that my wimp teacher calls undisciplined. Now that's encouraging. You must let me read them sometime. Would you? Sure. Family? My dad teaches Egyptology-- What? --at the University. Egyptology, he's in that for tombs. And I have a gorgeous mother who tried to run my love life. I hope that isn't one of your little prose things. It's a letter from Paul, we've split. I'm free. Well, thanks, Mr. Sinclair. Ashley. Ashley, how do you call anyone Ashley? Well, try it. Ashley. Ashley. I guess you could get used to it. So long. Hey, he's back. (WHISPERING) Would you really like to read some of my stuff? Sure. How will I be able to-- I'm in the book. Now that's what I call chic. He's gone. Thanks, Ashley. Are you gay? No. I always like to know if a guy is gay. [chatter] [music playing] [phone rings] Hello? Oh, no, no. It's still early. Well, I called because I thought if you ever did get to reading my stuff, and if I ever did call, you wouldn't know my name. If you did call, I would know, because right here on the folder it says "personal and confidential for Sarah Norton's eyes only." No matter what anyone says, you have a responsibility to write. You have an absolutely natural talent. Well, sure. Same place, I'll buy you another cappuccino. No no, Paul covers that place like the CIA. Well, perhaps you'd like to come out here. On Sunday? Do I have to wait until Sunday? Well, I've got tomorrow morning off from school. All right. Goodbye. [music playing] Hi. Hello, there. Are those your horses? ASHLEY ST. CLAIR: No, just friends. I wasn't sure you'd come. I always come when I invite myself. What are you doing to the tree? This is to keep the rabbits from the bark. Cardboard will keep them away? Well, it isn't the Brandenburg Concertos. I don't get it. Well, the story goes that Bach dedicated the concertos to the Margrave of Brandenburg, who not only never had them performed, but gave the manuscripts to his gardener to save his trees from the rabbits. Ah, that Bach. He tastes so good. Come on in. This is it. Nice music. Vivaldi. Ashley, are you telling me the truth about my stuff, what you read? You're going to be a writer. Don't ever doubt it. Now, you tell me the truth. Why did you give them to me to read? After all, we'd only met. I felt as if I should. Aren't we going in? [flute music playing] Let me turn this down. Drink? Fruit juice? Cola? Could I have some white wine, please? Oh. I've never been in a painter's studio before. This is where it all happens. And what doesn't happen, as the case may be. This place-- all of this, and you don't use it? You don't paint? How come? It's a long, dull story. Why are you so mad at Hamlet? Why are you changing the subject? The subject and object of this visit was to talk about your writing. But now? Hamlet. Was a skunk. So you say. But he had a few family problems. OK. Who hasn't? But he's supposed to be dying of love. And what does he do? Sends a girl off to a monastery. - A nunnery. - A nunnery. Same difference. Then he disappears and let's a girl go nuts. If that isn't a Danish skunk, what is? [inaudible] He wasn't in a position to offer her much. Then he should have let her alone in the first place. Let's have a look at that folder. I made some notes. You really took the trouble? Let me ask. Your friend, Paul, was it? - Exactly right. Paul was it. You didn't patch things up? Paul is permanently a dead issue. Perhaps. But it occurred to me there might be some connection between him and the way you feel about Hamlet. This man is very lovable but completely whacked. Maybe it comes from being alone too much. Will you let me come again? Yes. I'd like that very much. Ah, that Bach. He tastes so good. Toke? Not now. Well? I spent the day with a man. I have the strongest kind of feeling for him. Who? He's a real man. I mean, older. For instance? 30? Older. 35? 60. You have the strongest kind of feeling for a man who is 60? Aw, Jesus, Sarah. He's robbing the cradle. No. You're robbing the grave. That's 60? You see much? Excuse me. [banjo music playing] [clapping] Is that how you dressed when you painted? Not quite. But there was an artist who took off all his clothes when he painted. You just made that up. No. Have you reached William Blake in school? Blake. Wasn't he-- A divine madness. Shall I tell you a story? Make us some pomegranates. What I love most is to hear you tell stories. Blake lived in the Regency period. Aside from a certain decadent aristocracy, that was a puritanical time. The devout parishioners returning from a nearby church on Sunday were horrified to see Blake painting in his garden stark naked. He was pretty old then-- 65. Very old. He couldn't stand being locked indoors enclosed. He moved his tools out into the garden so he could feel the sun, while he worked against the deadline of death. One day, it rained. And the proper people of the town stared tight-lipped and tight-assed at the spectacle of Blake-- again, stark naked-- with a servant holding an umbrella over his head as the old man painted. Painted. Well, there was one young girl. One deeply passionate young girl. She understood him. She adored him. She would steal away from her family and run through wood and field to watch him work. She had long, raven black hair. And running through the wood to get to his place, her hair would get tangled in bramble and bush. And he thought her a wild, beautiful vision. And he fell in love with her. He talked to her from his garden. He loved her to madness. His madness and hers. How did it end? The impossibility of it all drove her to suicide. She drowned herself just like the girl in Hamlet. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go home. I just want to be with you. Now, this easel spins around. All you do is step on the pedal and spin. This was a collage in the making. Now, where would you put this? I'd put it here. Well, how about there? Oh, yes. Now he's really moving. Mm-hmm. This was for the big stuff. That is big. Get on. Huh? Come on, get on. Come on. Now, hold on. Hold on. Holding. All right? Ready. You are the most perplexing, intriguing girl. Did you do that? I don't get it. No, I did not do that. That's tar paper. It was left here by the farmer who built this barn, and couldn't take it down. And I love it. I love all the things that went into it's making. The dust, wheat, hay. Picasso said, dust is the artist's friend. Dust, smoke, things that settle. And the artist will utilize any tool. Now, you go and light that candle on the table over there. Take end. Over your head. That's it. Now, come on here. [inaudible] Now, I'm going to make a flower. The most beautiful sounds and the English language are the names of flowers. Columbine, Veronica, Violets, Rosemary, Aster, [inaudible], Licinius, and of course, Forget Me Nots. A rather contrite little flower. Hold this. What's this? A blowtorch. That's right. Now, this, too, can be an artist's tool. Light it. OK. [inaudible]. Ah, that Bach. There's a play called, "The Lady's Not For Burning." This could be a poster for it or Stravinsky's fire bird. Or she could be a phoenix symbol for the artist's talent that burns itself out and has to rise from the ashes over and over again. Sarah. Sarah. You're so beautiful, and fun, and alive when you talk about painting. And you're not working. This is where you're going to paint me. I'll give you a million dollars. I'll write an immortal poem and dedicate it to you. I'll love you forever. [music playing] (SINGING) Oh, when the saints. Oh, when the saints come-- Hello, Sarah. Hey, Dad. What did I do? That was for nothing. (SINGING) Oh, when the saints-- hi, Mom. Hi, Sarah. I invited Paul for breakfast. Sarah. Sarah. Why don't you talk to him? He's terribly hurt. I have nothing to say to him. Then talk to me. I am your-- Mother. Not my sister. Why do you always have to make me feel older than God? I have a great idea. Why don't you divorce Dad and marry Paul? "Women's Wear Daily" would love it. I want peace negotiations between you and your mother. I can't stand her obsession with my private life. Sarah, don't be dumb. I refuse to have a dumb daughter. She's concerned. Grant her the right to be concerned? Begrudgingly. Well, you've got a 16th birthday coming up, and I want it to be nice. Now, will you end this war for me? OK. [speaking italian] Good. Now, I want your ham sand which. You got it. Daddy? Mm-hmm. Did you ever have an affair with a young girl? Sarah, I'm old enough to be your father. C'mon, professors fool around with their students all the time. Did you? Now who's obsessed with who's private life? Me. Where you ever attempted. No. You swear? No. Well, did you? No. When you did, how much older were you? Gimme a break. I love you, too. Ashley? Hmm? Will you take me on your boat one day? My boat is not here. It's in Antigua in the Caribbean. Will you take me there some time? We could rent a boat down at the marina one of these days. Would you like that? Great. Girlfriends-- Ruspoli and-- Smitty. Smitty. You can invite them. Would they like to come? If they'd like to come? They'd drop dead to come. Are you writing? SARAH NORTON: Trying. Trying to write about us. To tell you the truth, more about me. The way I see us. What do your parents say of my painting you? SARAH NORTON: They don't say anything. They don't know. Where do you tell them you are? I tell them lies. What would they say if they knew? Well, my mother would say, Sarah, how wonderful. I'm coming with you. Do you want her to come? I'll think about it. No more today. Go home. - May I? - Sure. Not much there. Wow. Who is she? ASHLEY ST. CLAIR: Claudia. Who's Claudia? Someone I've known for a long time. Someone I'm close to. Was she your lover? And more. When everyone else gave up on me, she was always there. Are you going to marry her? No. She's a business woman. Has an art gallery in New York. We both have our own lives. We prefer it that way. OK. Does she have other lovers? Never asked. You know what Columbo would say about that? Who's Columbo? SARAH NORTON: Who's Columbo? Are you from Mars? He's a detective on TV. I'm crazy about him. What would he say? SARAH NORTON: Claims he loves her but never asked. Maybe this guy uses a chastity belt. How old is this Claudia anyway? ASHLEY ST. CLAIR: 44. Well, no contest. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Do you feel close to me? Yes. Tomorrow. Are you out of your mind? [phone ringing] Aldridge Gallery. Claudia? It's Ashley. And here she is. Ashley. What are you doing so far away? Missing you. Why don't you come up here to Toronto? I'd love to. Next weekend? Claudia, I'm painting again. He's painting again. Oh, my dear. You're wonderful. You're steadfast. I admire you. I'm glad he's painting again. I'm glad for him. I'm glad for you. But 10 years. Even then, his painting toward the end-- In the end, you just stopped trying. You made a fortune out of Ashely St. Clair. I didn't stop trying. People stopped caring. Claudia, you have a gallery. You know what's happened in the art world. Ashley simply didn't move with the times. Oh, Como. Call Madeline. Tell her I'm on my way. COMO: Yes, sir. Claudia, I'll tell you what. You want my contract with him? I'll give it to you. I'd take it if my gallery had half as much clout as yours, you son of a bitch. Can I drop you somewhere? Harold, you've got to try. Let's see what he's got. A break? It's finished. Can I see it? Come. Tell me what you think of it. I don't know the difference between the Sistine Chapel and the Burger King. What do you think? In the 10s. It's no good. You can't pick up the brush after 10 years and expect it to be good. An Israeli painter named Marika said in well. An artist has to be on the alert like an army. You can't go to sleep for 10 years. And when artists stop working, they find sick ways of destroying themselves. You know what one painter did a few years ago? He slit his wrists. Sprayed his blood all over the canvas until he dropped dead. It's no good. It's no good. Then make it good. Do it again. And if you have to, again and again. Don't send me away, Ashley. Perhaps you'd like this. It would make a handsome gift. It's charming, Hank. Did you find the artist? Yes, I did. Just give me a moment. What are you staring at? I'm sorry. I've seen you somewhere before starting at me just like that. I'm a painter. Would you consider sitting for me? I'd like to paint you. What the hell for? You paint? Yes. Will you be here next week? It ain't for me to decide-- him upstairs. SARAH NORTON: Ashley? I'm late. You look marvelous. Just for you. SALESMAN: Ashley? Come look. Monkeys. They were all the rage in the French courts of the period. Intense. ASHLEY ST. CLAIR: Would you like it? Excuse me. I'd love it, but it's too expensive. Anyway, where would I put it? I'd have to hide it. Hmm. I hadn't thought of that. So let's-- oh, Ashley. Look. Look at all those hats. This one's gorgeous. SALESMAN: It's a Borsalino. Can I try it? Sure. What a strange face. It gives me the creeps. Me, too. And the Borsalino. I'd die for this hat. It's yours. And it becomes you. That looks awful. - Try it. - Nah. Come on, try it. It's not bad. That's what I like about you. An open mind. [bagpipes playing] Do you want to get me arrested? They might even put us in solitary. That was good. Who taught you to cook? I read a book. - Weren't you lonely? - Not now. I have a proposal to make. Look, I started all this. I picked you up at the patisserie. I collaborated. I invited myself to your house. I received you. I asked you to paint me. For which I shall be eternally grateful. What's the proposal? A heart to heart talk. It's time. I know that certain people shouldn't get all tangled up together, but they can't help it. They do because they-- Have an affinity. Right. Eating with a man is intimate, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Are you attracted to me? I mean, physically? Yes. Have you thought of going to bed with me? Yes. Let's. Obviously, no. Is it because you think I'm a virgin? Because if you think I am-- You are. I am. Look, you've got to help me with this burden. You remember what Ben Johnson wrote about the last living virgin in Venice? He was thinking of me. Help. My-- I don't think my heart could stand it. What's the matter? Is something wrong with your heart? Well, sometimes it behaves strangely. Like now. You're kidding, aren't you? Yes. Because sometimes I spy on you jogging. You do? I do. And you look great, and strong, and young. You crazy kid. Don't say that, Ashley. Please. Give me your hand. This is no crazy kid speaking. I love you. I'm in love with you. When we meet again-- if ever we do meet again-- I'll reintroduce myself. My name is Ashley St. Clair. I'm a painter, and I'm 60 years old. SARAH NORTON: I don't care. - I'm 60! I don't care. I wouldn't care if you were in a wheel chair. I love you. Sarah. Kiss me? Just once. SARAH NORTON: Anymore work today? I don't think so. I'll collect my things. CLAUDIA: Darling? Claudia. I, uh-- I wasn't expecting you until the 15th. This is the 15th. Oh. I've been working. And for some reason, I thought it was the 14th. I want to see. - Yes. There. Unbelievable. You're working on both of these at the same time? This now? What's going on, Ashley? I'm painting. Yes, darling. You are. And that's wonderful. Claudia, this is Sarah. Sarah, Claudia. Hello. SARAH NORTON: Hello. I have to run. No need to go. She has to run. Thank you for lunch. Great shoes you've got there, lady. Great shoes. I thought she was just a kid. She is. How long have you known her? About a month. Oh, you goddamn fool. You're a perfect age to play the horse's ass. You're in love with her, aren't you? Yes. Oh, you goddamn fool. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Can't you knock? Don't be such a little creep. I have a message for you. Someone called Ashley phoned. He seems anxious to talk to you. I don't want to talk to any Ashleys. What's wrong? SARAH NORTON: Nothing's wrong. Sarah. SARAH NORTON: Nothing's wrong. Who's Ashley? A painter. Not Ashley St. Clair? What have you got to do with Ashley St. Clair? Answer me. He paints me. Since when? Mother, could you please leave me alone for a little while? My god, Sarah. He's old enough to be your father. He's old enough to be your father. Look darling, I know how attractive older men can be to girls your age. Believe me, you'd be surprised how well I know. But I also know that you're getting-- Please, I'll talk to you about it later. I swear I will. Just leave me alone. Oh my god, Sarah. Mother? When did he call? A few minutes before you got home. [phone ringing] Oh, Sarah. Thank god you phoned. I-- no, no, no. She went back to New York. She-- she didn't think she should stay. Please come. (SINGING) [french] ALL: (SINGING) [french] Hopeless. We try it again. [laughter] A poem written in my youth. In this world since God began it, there's nothing sweeter than a pomegranate. A measure of my love, my last one. Hey, where are you? Away. Away. What do you see there? I see you offering a pomegranate to someone your own age, and I'm kicking the bucket. Hey, Lieutenant. A day like this, a sky like this, and this guy's talking about kicking the bucket. Come here. I promise never to die on a day like this. Yes. Yes, by god, I like them. What those sons of bitches did was to make me feel I should apologize for what I did. For I knew how to do. One crapulous critic called me an illustrator. I let it get to me, by Christ. SARAH NORTON: You were just a crazy, mixed up kid. All those years lost. All that time lost. Nude with cigar. Get dressed. You painted Claudia in the nude. Get dressed. My body's as good as Claudia's any day. Get dressed. Don't be mad at me. You know I'm just jealous of Claudia. Tell me, why the cigar? I felt naked without it. I'm never going to leave you, Ashley. Get. Tomorrow? Right after school. I'll break all speed records. Hello. Hello. Paul, you look terrible. What are you doing here? You-- you screwed that awful perv. You take your clothes off for everybody but me. Don't [inaudible]. [screaming] [interposing voices] Stop it! Stop it! Leave me alone! Sarah! I saw! [screaming] I saw. Let me go. Let me go. Oh my god. [screaming] Let me go! Stop it! Sarah. [screaming] [crying] Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Paul took my key. Please. Please. Please. Oh my god. Get back to the studio. Call an ambulance. Run! The boy has a fractured skull. Will he-- We'll pull him out. Kids. Paul is going to be all right. Oh my god. His parents are not here. They're in Spain. I know. I asked your parents to call them. Yes, I phoned them. DOCTOR: That's her over there. I think her parents phoned. They're going to take me away. Don't be afraid. I'll tell them. Sarah-- I'm all right, Mother. We'd like to be left alone with our daughter. Don't go, Ashley. Mr. St. Clair is leaving. Mr. Norton. You are a disgusting old-- Don't you talk to him like that. Sarah. I'll ring you tomorrow. SARAH NORTON: Let me out of here! Goddamn you, let me out! No. Not-- Let me out! You're staying-- Let me out! Sarah-- I want to get out! Michael! Sarah-- You don't let me free, things will never be the same. I trust you, Sarah. You've only to promise never to see him again. No. Are you on the pill? Can you imagine if you became pregnant? Let me out of here. Not until you've promised. No. Then you'll stay here until you do. You'll do all your studies here. And if you refuse, we'll call in a psychiatrist. Home sweet gulag. You take all your meals here. Mom, Dad, I won't eat until you let me out of here. Sarah? No, Mother. No. We love you. I can sit here forever as long as you pay me. Excuse me. Hello? Could you tell me how Sarah is, please? This is Ashley-- [phone ringing] Hello? [doorbell] Mr. Norton-- Don't ever come here again! [doorbell] I just want to know if Sarah is all right. - She's fine. - Will you please tell her-- Nothing. Get out. Let me assure you-- Don't try. You've confused the hell out of her. All I ask is that you-- You can't ask anything. For god sakes, will you leave her alone? She's only a child. Will you please let me make a suggestion? Mr. St. Clair, you may be older than we are, but we don't need your advice. Now, it's obvious we can't appeal to your sense of decency, but maybe, just maybe you have a sense of the ridiculous. Because you are ridiculous, Mr. St. Clair. Get the hell out of here. You want to die on your birthday? Please, Sarah. Talk to us. Rosenkranz and Guildenstern. Hi, Dr. Reid. Out. So long, Sarah. Out. Bye. You're nuts. Think I need a shrink? I think you need a good kick in the pants. I think you'd all be more concerned about Paul. Paul is fine, and he's eating. When his parents get home, they'll probably throw me in jail. It'd be better than this place. No they won't. He's admitted he attacked you. He's been mainlining methedrine. - Did he tell you? - Yes. Well, he's growing up. It seems as if everyone's growing around here too fast. Sarah, why did you stop seeing Paul? He would have stopped seeing me anyway. Why? You really want to know? Yes. Because I wouldn't let him sleep with me. Well, that's as good a reason as any. Which brings us to-- Sarah, what about this old gentleman? Boy, is my mother a low life. Yes. And among other things, she wanted me to ascertain that you are still a virgin. How do you do that? Radar, forceps-- Jesus. Sarah, your virginity or non-virginity is of no interest to me. But you must eat. Try force feeding, doc. Sarah, you're going to be sick. Very, very sick. Now, I supervised your entrance into this world, and I am damned if I am going to supervise your exit. And I don't-- Dr. Reid, if you want to treat me well, you're going to have to treat me like a woman. Now, I don't want to be sick. I don't want to waste away. That old gentleman happens to mean more to me than anything else. And the next time I eat will be with him. Happy birthday. That's all very enlightened. Well, what would you do in our place? DR. REID: I tell you what I'd do in her place. I'd make a promise never to see that man again, and then I'd break that promise just like that. Would you like us to reserve them a suite at the Plaza? - I don't like the Plaza. - Oh, Emily. Come on. We're all friends, but please save us the wit today. I have got to make you realize. Crazy as it seems, but this is not slight stuff. I saw a woman up there. A woman deeply in love and you have got to let her live it. Doctor, you need a doctor. And Sarah needs to eat. Locking her in up there. It's inhuman, unfeeling, and probably illegal. She loves you. I'd think you want to keep it that way. Emily, wait a minute. I want to invite you to a party. Now, don't try and stop me Philippa. Smitty, Daniella? You get off your little asses and move. She's 16 today. We're going to have a party tonight. And you know the kids from school she'd want to invite. So go-- No move. Music-- bring that weird quartet and the cute girl with the flute. OK. Hey, Philippa. Now, who can we find who will make us a wonderful cake on such short notice? The Fleischers. Mr. St. Clair? Only us here, honey. Where's Mr. St. Clair? He went to New York yesterday. What? Take a look. There you go. Aw, Jesus. Jesus. [instruments warming up] ALL: (SINGING) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Sarah. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Sarah. Happy birthday to you. - What am I going to tell her? - Nothing. For tonight, you keep your mouth shut. Bravo. [applause] The door is open, Sarah. Can I spend the night at Smitty's? Yes. Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING - "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"] You know where she's going. Oh, yes. He just walked out? No note, no message-- nothing? You know, it's the nicest thing he could do. Do you have any money? Not much. Why? How much does it cost to go to New York? Oh, come on, Sarah. No. I'm not going to let you go to New York. That's crazy. I'll tell your mother. How much? Sarah, listen. You don't know New York. It's a big place. You'll get lost. You'll get mugged. How much does it cost? [music playing] The question is not whether I like them. You never did respect my opinions. The question is can I sell them? I don't think I can. Those are good paintings, Harold. I don't say they aren't. Ashley, the past 10 years, I've been one of the strongest galleries in the world. A gallery with a definite voice, a definite character. Any buyer anywhere who wants contemporary work, work in the mainstream, automatically thinks of the Boutelle Gallery. I can't go back to the well-made portrait. I can't go back to the figure. You owe Ashley some loyalty, Harold. He helped you make that strong gallery. Sadly, Claudia, loyalty is unprofessional. Friendship is one thing, business is-- Harold, the only friends you ever cared about were the ones who made money for you. And even then you stole from them. How dare you. You would sell my paintings to the Malay Gallery in Dusseldorf, 40% commission. And Mr. Godellia was the silent owner of the Malay Galleries. Artists are not blind. They are not stupid. They just know they have to live with people like you. I'll try to forget this. Every time I sold here or in Dusseldorf, you made money, too. Harold, he didn't mean-- He did mean. I'll send for the paintings tomorrow. Come on, Claudia. Ashley, I do want to forget this. Let me make you a retrospective next year. We'll collect all your finest work over the years-- Retrospectives are for painters with one foot in the grave. Ashley, maybe it's not a bad idea. No! You'll have to wait until I'm dead for that. Both of you. You're going to get Mr. St. Clair back. Sarah? Sarah? Ah, that Bach. Excuse me. I know this is your house. It's very nice. I didn't know where else to go. It's OK. Maybe I'm on your side. Be my guest. Take her to bed with you. Telephone her father. Do anything that comes in your head that's definite, so long as she knows where the hell she is. I'll be at Marika's. Don't do that to people! You don't do that to people! You don't do that to people! You don't just disappear. And on my birthday. Was that your present to me? Yes. Well, I think it was a rotten present. What are you, some kind of hit and run driver? I guess I can go back now. I don't think I have anything else to say. The only one who had the right thing to say in all of this was your father. He had the right words. Get out. That was honorable. I tell you. It's "Gone with the Wind." The honorable Ashley St. Clair. Yes, sir. Honorable is why you didn't sleep with me. Get her all excited, but don't sleep with her. No isn't honorable. But please tell me, sir. Was it honorable to make me fall in love with you? You knew what was happening. Why didn't you stop it? You and your charm, your Brandenberg, and your god damn rabbits. Is that what you do? Go around charming little kids? Making little kids fall in love with you and then disappear? Sarah-- Don't tell me how old you are. I know it and I don't care. I know the numbers, all of them. When I'll be 60, you'll be 104. We'd make a great couple. Boy, do you owe me an explanation. I'll try, Sarah. I'll try. Yes, I could have stopped it. I didn't. What happened? I saw a young girl. She made me laugh. And I was amazed and flattered that she wanted to go to bed with me. And she awoke something in me that made me want to go to work again. Then I watched myself fall in love with her. 16. 60. Oh-- 60. I don't think there was a minute with you, Sarah, happy as it was-- I was happy. I don't think there was a minute when I could free myself from watching myself. I kept saying, what the hell are you doing? I saw this old idiot making a fool of himself over a young girl. And yet, every time you came on that silly little bike, my heart would lift again. When you stood there to be painted, when you offered yourself-- I'd say, she's young. She's lovely. Take the gift. Time's running out. Take it. You know what I think it was, Sarah? If I didn't make love to you, it wasn't because of honor, or morality, or any of that. I was afraid of what would happen to me. I was thinking of myself. I couldn't face not holding onto you. I couldn't face the ridicule. I couldn't face Claudia's ridicule. I didn't have the strength to face your eventual, inevitable regrets. And yet, I let myself say it. Resolves and resumes all this-- I love you. Sarah, I love you. That isn't a nice thing to say now. What do you want from me? What do you want from me, Ashley? I can tell you what I want from you. I want you to go on loving me as I go on loving you. I'll tell you why. This collision, this accident, this beautiful dirty trick-- we once talked about affinity. I could never measure what you gave me or what I gave you, except all the love I had to give. But I want you to think of the short life we had as-- as-- worthwhile. You're going to be a beautiful, talented woman. Me-- whatever new life you make, whatever is left of mine, I want us to go on loving each other. When I'm married and have 18 kids, I'll go on loving you. I'll go on. [MUSIC PLAYING - "CIRCLE OF TWO"] LYRICS: Pennies you toss in a stream. Tarnished and left to turn green. Daydreams that start with no end in view forming a circle of two. Poems that cover the page. Paintings that crumble with age. Teardrops that cling to the morning dew forming a circle of two. Love, love lingers on when it's over. I can't get over my moments with you. Love, it tosses your whole world around. Up and then down, spinning around in a circle of two. Love, it clouds up your mind if you let it. And I'm glad I let it. I've learned something new. Love tosses your whole world around. Up and then down, spinning around. Half of me, half of you. Forming a circle of two.
