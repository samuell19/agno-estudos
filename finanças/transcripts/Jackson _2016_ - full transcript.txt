(birds singing) - Do not remove the ancient landmark nor enter the fields of the fatherless for their redeemer is mighty, He will plead their cause against you. Oh Lord yes. - Look at there. Look at that. Here we go again. I don't know if, oh there's the truck there. They're starting to come, okay. Oh another day, another day. A little child is out there screaming. That is unreal. They have children saying that you're a murderer. They got a violin player. So here we go again, another day, another day with them. - If you're pregnant please take and read this information. Mommy, Mommy please don't kill me Mommy. Mommy I have a dream Mommy. - Why would I do that, this way too easy Roy. - [Child] Stop killing your baby! In the end there will be judgment! - [Shannon] Baby I'm not, I'm not pregnant. I'm not pregnant baby. - [Child] Please don't kill your baby! - Miss the baby doesn't want to die. Please listen to the word of the Lord. - [Shannon] They teach the little children. They got these little bitty children saying this. - First thing we want people to know, it's bad for the women. And then secondly, and very importantly, there are free centers that are called Crisis Pregnancy Centers. We help them, stay with them, we assign people to them like a mentor. Ma'am do the right thing please. Please do the right thing. You talk to them while I go talk to these people. If you're about 10 weeks this is the size of your little baby. So y'all, y'all are pregnant and decided not to abort right? (contemplative music) - [Dr. Parker] Good morning. - [Patient Group] Hi, how are you? - I'm Dr. Parker. I'm one of the doctors who work here at the clinic. The state requires us to do some very specific things. But I think some of the information I'm required to tell you is designed to kind of discourage from deciding to have an abortion. First of all the state requires me to tell you that there's a risk of bleeding, there's a risk of infection, there's a risk of damage to any of your organs. Now guess what all of those complications are also associated with having childbirth. The thing that I have the most problem with having to tell you but I'm required to tell you is that by having an abortion it might increase your risk for breast cancer. There's no scientific evidence that abortion increases your risk for breast cancer. I can't say enough this is your decision. This is not anything you have to be ashamed of. Disregard those people out there. They know nothing about your life. They know nothing about you. This is healthcare and we're here to make sure that you can have safe, legal access to abortion. And that's your choice and that's your right to do that. - Yeah the police jus told them that they had to get those signs off, because they gonna tell me they don't have to move the signs, something about a line. What does the ground have to do with our fence? This is our fence, you cannot prop it on our fence. - [Ms. Esther] Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. - Nope, nope, the police just told them Ms. Esther that they cannot, they have to take everyone of these signs down. - [Ms. Esther] No it's on public property. - [Shannon] No it's not. - [Ms. Esther] I know that the-- - Let me ask, why was nothing said when the police were here? - [Ms. Esther] We had a few more. - No no, the police made them move every one of them. They moved every sign I was standing right out-- - No. - Yes they did. - I put them right here. - No that was afterwards Ms. Esther. - No it was not. - It was afterwards. - When Major Mcgallen was there. - When he was here they moved. - You're just trying to-- - No I'm not, y'all trying to, y'all, well don't talk to me Ms. Esther 'cause y'all trying to cause difficulty. - I know what the public sidewalk is because the line is right over here. Come and look at the line. - It's crazy ain't it? Yeah, she'll be out there all day. But she's hungry, she's tired, she's thirsty. But she's not leaving. She'll pass out before she leave and miss something. See that, you saw that truck? Yeah that means they're getting ready to come back in. (contemplative music) - [Radio] The Supreme Court has made it very clear that is not going to overturn Roe versus Wade. You're seeing efforts in this state to see how far they can take it short of restricting abortion outright. - [Radio] The GOP is waging war on women at the grass roots level. Five states have only one clinic left. These attacks are creating a situation where abortion is legal in America, and in some places impossible to get. (contemplative music) - [Barbara] Hello there. - [Man] Hello, how are you? - I'm Barbara Beavers, I'm the Director at the Pregnancy Care Center here in Jackson. We love y'all, y'all are doing good. You're doing what you can do and we're very very grateful. I know, does that make sense? Listen to what I, the Lord told me this morning. You know we go and we do abstinence education, and so we give these kids these suckers that say Dum Dums. And we say don't be a dumb dumb, save sex. We say don't be a dumb dumb, save sex for marriage. But I thought today I could say don't be a dumb dumb, you don't solve a problem by killing a baby. - Absolutely 100% right, I agree with you. - You hear me? - I agree with you. - Well good, who are you? - I'm Randy Boyd, District 19. - Randy Boyd, District-- - [Man] 28. - 28, Cleveland. Good, take a handful, and don't be a dumb dumb. We're not gonna solve it by killing our babies. - That's right. - We're gonna solve it by finding positive ways to deal with the issue. - That's right. - God together. - We appreciate your efforts. - Well thank you. We appreciate y'all, we appreciate, we got a great, come on we gonna do something in Mississippi now. (contemplative music) (phone ringing) - CPC, how can I help you? (contemplative music) Okay, I can help you with that. Could I make an appointment for you? - We're a life affirming agency. We want to affirm the choice for life. And help them make a choice for life. There's nothing life affirming about abortion. You're deceiving yourself if you say you can kill your baby and it be good for you. That's just deception, that's not true. It doesn't, it doesn't register with reality. Mommas, women are not made that way. Women are made to protect and to guard and to, to die for their babies, not their babies to die for them. And I say that with tears in my eyes 'cause one out of three women have done that. - Hey. - [Receptionist] Hey, how you doing? - I'm doing okay, I had an appointment at two o'clock. - [Receptionist] Okay, there's a pen right there. - [April] I put my name? Yes ma'am. - [Receptionist] Okay, I need you to put sonogram over here. S-O-N-A, sona, that'll work. - I'm undecided see I want to deliver babies, I want be a LP, a LPN, or a Dental Associate. See I got so much I want to be. - You can just have a seat right there please. Now I'm not a nurse, and I'm not a doctor and so I don't diagnose or confirm what I'm finding today. You ready for me to turn on the big screen for you? This is your baby right here. You're seven weeks and three days. Now I want to get you a picture today, if you'd like one. Would you like a picture? You want one with hi Mom on it? (contemplative music) - Turn to this building and prophecy! ♪ You are fallen and you will not rise up again In the name of Jesus! ♪ Oh innocent blood is crying out from this ground White babies, black babies, here this Jackson! ♪ God hates the hands that shed innocent blood No Jesus don't love you for this. ♪ God hates the hands that shed innocent blood - If hate is a sin, and you're singing a song that says God hates the hands of a person who sheds innocent blood, God hates. So you're calling God a hater. I'm just trying to see what the logic in what they say and how does it make sense to all these adults out here. ♪ Innocent blood ♪ Innocent blood is crying out from the ground - Willy you have made it where none of us are safe. You have unleashed the shedding of innocent blood on our nation and now our school children aren't even safe. - You should have more respect for those children who died then to use their name for your own ends. - Just like the blood of these children you're gonna murder today. You need to repent before it's too late. - Have a good day man. - You won't be smiling when you stand before God and give an account of the things that you've done in this life. - Good morning, good morning, good morning. That guy was giving me the business. I violated one of my own rules again, I said that I was not going to respond or say anything to those protestors but to me, it's particularly bothersome that in order to make their point there's nothing sacred for them Every morning when I turn that corner and pull into that parking lot. - [Shannon] It's there. - My heart pumps a little bit harder. - [Shannon] It's there, it's always there. - Whenever I park that car, whenever the security guy comes. - Always, whenever I pull up, I always kind of sit for a second. I never just jump out the car. I always sit for a second, I look back and forth. I'm like (takes deep breath) okay, you know. But it's always there. It's somewhere in the back of your head, you can't be inside a facility like this and it not be there all the time. It's always there. - [Dr. Parker] What are you doing your masters work in? Doing the MSW, okay wonderful. You know for a lot of women, part of the decision is taking care of your family and furthering your career goals so that you can take care of yourself and your family. So I don't know why that's so hard for other folk to understand. Some of the people who judge you and try and stand in you way from making this very important decision would have a fit if someone tried to control their lives in the same way. So lots of pressure, relax, try and relax that muscle. (tube sucking air) We're almost done hang in there, you doing okay? In the home stretch, hang in there. (tube sucking air) (contemplative music) On Tuesday the Taliban deliberately shot a 14 year old Pakistani girl on her way home from school because she was promoting education for girls. Education creates life chances for you. - [Shannon] That's right. - Unplanned, unwanted pregnancy diminishes life chances for you. - [Shannon] That's right. - You can kill a person, or you can lock them into circumstances you make them wish that they were dead. Unfortunately people will hear that story, and think that it is more tragic than what happens to women in Mississippi. I've been asked do you think it's racist? It doesn't have to be racist when the affect is the same, doesn't matter what their motives are. The reality is disproportionately women of color are being affected by the policies that are being legislated in this state. - That's true. - And somebody has to say that. - That is true. (contemplative music) - What a great day it was to allow the theology of Heaven to become biography in the streets here in the city of Jackson, Mississippi. (applauding) We can bring abortion to an end. Now if we just look at this place here in Jackson, Mississippi you see cracks all over the outside of that edifice, everything just appears like it's break down and fall and crumble to the ground. Let's push it over the cliff. Could it be possible that right at that memorial, right there, we could present to God the first abortion free state. It will send a message to the church of Jesus Christ throughout this land. And will become a bright shining light that will radiate from Jackson into all of the other states saying we can take care of this issue ourselves. (applauding) ♪ But grace has taught my heart to fear ♪ And grace our fears relieved ♪ How precious did that grace appear ♪ The hour I first believed ♪ My chains are gone ♪ I've been set free ♪ My God my Savior has ransomed me ♪ And like a flood his mercy reigns ♪ Unending love amazing grace - Hallelujah Lord, Jesus! (cheering and applauding) (contemplative music) - I'll tell you another thing that's happening around here. I'm making a stump speech, I have a stump speech you know. I have to tell them why we have to have CPC's. You know I'm raising money. (laughs) Why do we need this? So I have to tell them why we need CPC's. The enemy's become bolder and louder. He insists on trying to remove the shame and guilt from abortion by denying that it exists. These are our children, our Mississippi babies being destroyed and what will our legacy be? What'll we leave behind? We will value all life as a gift from a mighty and merciful God. We're so thrilled to have y'all here today. We are so blessed that y'all have come to hear the governor and we're so blessed with our governor. (applauding) - People say you need to leave that abortion thing alone. All the things that I believe in they say just leave alone and be one of those moderate middle of the road politicians and never take a stand. Just not me, I can't do that. - That's right. - Amen. - So we're gonna ask the legislature again to help protect children. Doesn't that child in the womb, doesn't she have any rights? Doesn't she have a right to life? (applauding) To liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? So go into the pulpits and spread the word. I'm gonna do all I can whenever I can, in every way I can to protect life in this state. One day, I do believe, that I will stand before you and say there are no abortions being performed in Mississippi. (applauding) Thank you and watch your leaders, God bless you all. (applauding) - The Mississippi legislature passed a law that requires doctors at abortion clinics, that is the one abortion clinic, to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. - New Republican governor Phil Bryant signed what's known as a trap law, specifically target, specifically onerous regulations for the state's loan abortion clinic that other kinds of medical clinics in Mississippi do not have to follow. Republicans have proposed these anti-abortion trap laws this session in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, West Virginia. Mississippi is different though. In Mississippi officials have been flat out admitting what they have been trying to do. - What we simply say is that we want Mississippi to be abortion free. (applauding) (contemplative music) - And there's a lot that's happening here in Mississippi particularly around abortion care. I think if people knew the particulars that they would understand how important it is for them to way in on the issue. I think it's very important that the whole country and the whole world knows what's going on here in Mississippi. This is the letter from a hospital, this one of the rejection letters. It says this hospital has received your medical staff application. After preliminary review the hospital has determined that your application should be denied for the following reasons, the nature of your proposed medical practice is inconsistent with this hospital's policies and practices as concerned abortion and in particular elective abortion. Number two in light of this hospital's rules and regulations concerning therapeutic abortions, namely that privileges for such procedures are not considered within the core privileges for gynecology or obstetrics, your application does not comport with a functional practice at this hospital. And number three, the nature of your proposed medical practice would lead to both an internal and external disruption of this hospital's function and business within the community. (contemplative music) - [Protestor] Please don't kill me! Don't kill my fetus in me! - Yep. - [Dr. Parker] And how many is that on? - The only one I was waiting on was actually yours Madison River Oaks. It wasn't, it was at the? - So how many hospitals turned us down altogether exactly? - We applied at seven, seven. - For each of us? - Yeah. - And that's all so. - Basically there was a new law that was enacted. Affectively this law has been setup to shut us down. Which means that the state could come in and see if we are in fact still performing abortions. And then they could say hey you're not in compliance with state law. And they could enact us getting closed down. We do have a legal team and we are working and other states are looking and saying hey Mississippi come on. You guys have the highest rate of teen pregnancy. You have no sex education anywhere. This is an issue that predominantly affects poor black women in this state. - Our state is falling tremendously in education. You mean to tell you you got this much attention on a woman's rights. - I don't think you can withhold sex education from people and then also withhold the option for abortion. People need information and access to care. So will see, we'll see what happens. But the next days, weeks, months are tentative. (contemplative music) - Y'all ready to eat? I bet Jamar is gonna eat some butter beans and some greens. Jamar you gonna eat some butter beans and some greens today? I need to make you some candied yams. You want some candied yams? - [Jamar] Yes ma'am. - [Mother] I'll bring it to you okay. - [April] I pray it's a boy. - Oh goodness. Is this little one yours? Alright how old is that one? - She'll be one Tuesday. - [Nurse] Oh my gosh, are you crazy? How old are the other ones? - Let's just say one, two, three, and four. - No, oh my gosh. (baby crying) Alright, baby's head is down. It's laying on it's belly. Is this the last one? Oh my gosh. Second thoughts? About what? - My baby. Be honest. - Not more than three. Awe now. - Yep, it's a boy. - [Nurse] It is a boy. - See you. - Have a good day. - [April] Hey why you in my stuff now? - You know you called him. You knew he was out. I'm just telling you, trying to help you. How you gonna tell me he was out? I don't give a fuck about him being out! - Okay Momma. - Jesus. - Dang. - Man fill you up with kids and he don't give a fuck about a damn one of them. But to come with some more dick in you when you ask. You know what my children daddy tell me? Don't look for no man to take care of you. Don't ever look for no man to help you. You don't need to be worried about me, worry about your kids, don't worry about me, don't call me. (dog barking) Leave that dog alone boy. Put that pizza down. (dog barking) (contemplative music) - Yes ma'am, I was wondering 'cause she has been inviting me to come to these Momma's and Me classes. Ain't it tomorrow? - [JT] Yes, it's tomorrow and at 11:15. - Okay can you let her know that I was gonna come to the Mommy and Me class tomorrow. - [JT] I will, what's your name? - April Jackson. - [JT] Okay April, I've got you down for the class tomorrow. - Okay thank you. (contemplative music) - Are you feeling bad April? No, but they just want you to be careful 'cause of your blood pressure and stuff. Listen you're gonna have you a whole. One of them's gonna have to be a big old football player and make Momma lots of money. (laughing) She wanted you to sit over there. And you get to know Ms. Sonya. - Well before I kind of get into what I had planned for today, I want you to know I'm a friend to you. And I care for you, so tell me a little bit about yourself. - Well you know I'm April Jackson anyway. I'm 24, I'm on my fifth child. My oldest child is four. - So kind of taking a bunch of prerequisite courses. Okay, can you kind of share with me why you think you have five kids? So hold on, so help me. So that first child that was conceived, you self aborted by drinking Clorox and water? - No he, I. - When you said you bled through I guess I took that as the baby was aborted. What, what's the take on forgiveness, April? The only way you can survive in life, the only way you can go about life, is by leaning and depending on Him. - I just stopped believing. - April what do you need today? Well let's go let you pick out some stuff for her. You can come right in here. Here I'll let you look through there. Here I'll let you kind of pick through those as well. And see what you think will fit. - Ma'am can I offer you some info? Can I pray with you? You know God loves you and He created you, and He has a great plan for you life. You know God is good. The scripture says that Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly. You know there's a Crisis Pregnancy Center and they offer free sonograms? They offer lots of free help and counseling. - The state is here, for our annual. You don't find out they're coming. You find out when they get here. They're not allowed to tell us when they're coming. So that's the point of it to catch you off guard. That you're up on your stuff. Need that log. Timecards, timecards. Sure, you can ask me now. I'm saying you better get it while you can. - [Inspector] It was good to see you. - You too baby, you too. - So today what, were we deemed to be in compliance? - [Shannon] We don't know until they send us the paperwork. - [Dr. Parker] Good for you, you run a tight ship. - Yeah, a very tight ship. - You play like you practice. That's what my coach used to tell me. - Yay coach (cheering) fear fingers. - [Shannon] Get out of here. - Fear fingers. - You know what you get out of here too. It's different every day isn't it? And it doesn't stop. Getting old, I'm getting too old for this girl. Could of did this, probably could have did it in my 20's. Dang I been here that long since my 20's ain't it. (woman crying) We don't think Momma don't know nothing 'til it's to late. And then we be like oh God. Then we scared to tell Momma, and scared to say anything. Feel bad 'cause you feel like you let Momma down. You know all that stuff. Your Momma love you, she gonna love you regardless baby. 'Cause if it happened to my baby, I would love regardless. (contemplative music) You tell that boy gone on Monday he's busy somewhere. Or whatever boy. Like I tell girls and I tell mommas. I am not gonna say she not gonna do nothing do more. You not able to say she not gonna do nothing 'cause we don't never think they gonna do it in the first place. Make sure you okay. If that's what you decide to do one day, if that's what, you know without Momma or anybody like you did this time, you make sure you okay. You make sure you love yourself more than anybody else okay. And if they can't do that then you ain't got no business with them no way. And that's the truth. - [Dr. Parker] What time tomorrow does have to be in service of the Queen. - Same time, same time, you're dismissed too. - [Dr. Parker] Which is what My Lady, what time? - 9:30. - 9:30? - Yes. (rain falling) (contemplative music) Well the state came in today. And of course they let me know that they came to check to see about our admitting privileges. Of which of course everybody knows that we don't have and cannot acquire. Of course we're not in compliance because none of the hospitals will allow our doctors to have admitting privileges because they for the most part, the majority of them, don't want to be affiliated with the abortion facility. Now I gotta figure out what's next. Where do we go from here? I don't know, I hope not. I can honestly say I don't know. I think that is the closest, this is the closest since I've been here that the clinic is been close to closing. - [Director] Are you there? Alright now, next for him and we'll be ready to go. - [Cameraman] Okay we're good thank you. Cell phones to off. - Tonight we travel to the last abortion clinic in Mississippi, which as we arrive has only 72 hours left before it appears the state will shut it down forever. - [Shannon] Okay here we go, here we go. - [Reporter] The last stand. Only 72 hours left and the clock is ticking. It's Mississippi's only abortion clinic. - There are babies being killed inside of this pink building. - [Reporter] The clinic on life support. Which side wins? - [Announcer] This special edition of Nightline, The Last Stand, whose side is God on? We'll be back. - They said whose side is God on. Now that's-- - [Reporter] The clinic is in violation of a state law. With that hearing fast approaching the protestor believe they are on the verge of triumph. Barbara Beavers plays a different role in the anti-abortion rights movement. Beavers runs a Crisis Pregnancy Center. - [Barbara] We have sanitized abortions. We can't go back to the coat hanger days. So we don't call them coat hangers anymore. We call them cannulas. That cannula does the same thing to the baby that the coat hanger did. - Well but it doesn't kill the mother-- - But it still kills the baby. - [Reporter] And so the battle continues, each side claims a high wall of purpose in which there is no room for compromise. But for now, this clinic stays open. - They think life is just what they do, that's life. And they think that's life for everybody. They don't know anything about the hood, the ghetto, drugs and all that stuff. They don't know anything about that. The whole thing is stop trying to convince everybody else that what they doing is the wrong thing because there is no right except what you know. You don't want to be judged for the way that you raise your kids. You don't want to be judged for the way that you live your life. Why are you judging everybody for the way that they are living theirs? They are the most judgemental people I've ever met. I'm 41 years old, those people that stand out there are more judgemental than anybody I have ever met in my life. (somber music) (April crying) - Alright thank you. (somber music) (knocking on door) (somber music) (sirens blaring) - This is not customary to do this but JT just heard mention she was probably sleeping with the baby. We don't always get that word. We don't always realize that's what's going on. Is that grandma there? No that's, that's one of the boys. Bringing presents. Bringing presents for the baby, got something for the baby. You gonna let me in? You want to come see it, come on? Hello there. Hello there, we brought you one. - [April] Well come on in. - [Brother] You need me to get that for you? - You are fine looking boys. Hey now Ty, we got you a bed. We want that bed put up and we want in that bed. That'll be better for you. Give you a little space from these other children. Well let's pray for your mama. Father God thank you for what you're doing in our lives, it's not easy Lord. But you can enable us and empower us and I pray grace for April. Okay well I need to scoot back, Ms. Marlene's by herself so I need to go back. But keep us in touch. We love you. - We'll see y'all. - We'll see you later. I trust that that'll be a blessing. You come on when you can, come on when you can April. Oh my lands. I think of where I been this weekend with my grands. It makes me sad. It makes me sad. I'm torn about that if you want to know the truth. I don't know, I don't know about that. I don't think birth control is the answer. I think ultimately what's gonna work is gonna be self control. And I think that's our job moreso than giving her birth control is to, to encourage her to assess herself and her value and her worth in such a way that she does not, she doesn't give herself away. The real issue with abortion is our immorality, our sexual immorality. And who am I to say that? I'm not, but God says it in His word. And I've seen it work positively in my own life and in the lives of others. And I've seen it work negatively when done in the world's ways. God's ways work and that's why don't give birth control or all that kind of stuff 'cause God's ways work. And they're 100% affective and they're good for you body, soul, and spirit. (contemplative music) - [April] Hey guys. - Could you sign in for me? - [Ms. Sonya] Hey bundle of joy. - [Counselor] I don't think she had planned to. - I trust myself a whole lot. - Can we see the baby? Are you showing off baby? Monica's just dying to see this baby. I am being very rude aren't I? But she's new and she needs to. (laughing) This is what she's here for. (laughing) (door shuts) - I want my daughter to be 10 times a better mama, than I a person than I was. I want her to be better. Don't go out and make the mistakes I made. Say I want to be better than what my momma was. Do what's right, go to school baby. I could be going to hair school. - You just want to not take a chance. (baby crying) - Here we go my darling, here we go my darling. (contemplative music) - We've been traveling from San Francisco and New York and really shining a light on nationwide there's a state of emergency for abortion rights. I guess one thing I want to ask you that we would like to learn more about too is maybe you could tell us a little bit about the patients you see. - I don't even know where to start as far as what type of patients are there. Of course the majority of our patients are African American patients. I saw a lot of patients who would come for their first visit and you know the come, I've seen them come for their first visit and be six weeks. And come back at last day that they can be here. Trying to come up with the money, as you're trying to come up with the money with the fetus debt increases and then. So I've seen that a lot. - I'm glad there's the funds but that Hyde Amendment, that's what's killing women that you're on Medicaid, you can't use that to cover your abortion. But it's outrageous that there are these laws saying you can get any kind of medical procedure covered, almost, but not if you're pregnant and you don't want to be, you can't get that. - Because I mean we even have patients who get funding and still don't have, can't come up with the other part. - I know because the funds they, I know what they do and it's a good thing. But they say do you have, can you collect cans? Do you have any jewelry you can sell? - [Shannon] Or can you pawn, yeah. - [Activist] Can you pawn something. Women go through a lot of-- - It's like being degraded almost. - [Activist] Yeah it is very degrading. - Yeah. - [Reporter] The Jackson Women's Health Organization is gearing up for a legal fight to keep the doors open. In a socially and religiously conservative state, some say political pressure may be a reason hospitals haven't signed on to help the clinic. - The question that the court is really asking tomorrow is can the state constitutionally do, indirectly and underhandedly, what it very clearly may not do directly which is to outright ban abortion. The real story here is what's at stake is the lives, and the health, and the diginity of women in Mississippi. (cheering and applauding) - [Activist] Is this clinic gonna shut down? - [Crowd] No! - [Activist] Are you gonna tell the women of Mississippi and around the country that they can't have abortions? - [Crowd] Hell no! - Are we gonna tell women they should be ashamed of their abortions? - [Crowd] Hell no! - [Activist] This clinic stays open. - [Crowd] This clinic stays open! - [Activist] No more lives of women broken. - [Crowd] No more lives of women broken! - I am just overwhelmed. (cheering and applauding) I really am. I have never experienced this many people just coming out for us, for all clinics. We have got to take shame out of the word abortion. And until we stop being ashamed of who are and what we believe in and what we know to be right, we're gonna continue to have these issues. It took me a long time but when I found what my reason and my purpose was, it's like a liberating feeling. Just knowing that this is what I'm supposed to be here to do. (cheering and applauding) - The world is watching. The world is watching in Mississippi. This clinic stays open. (contemplative music) - Mississippi's only abortion clinic can stay open tonight. - [Shannon] Come on, come on, come on, come on. I want a picture with the great Julie now. Yeah come on, come on, come on Dianne. - [Reporter] The Fifth Circuit of Appeals ruled a state law forcing doctors to get admitting privileges at a local hospital unconstitutional. - I am so impressed with you girl, I really am. Y'all ready? - Pink house. - Pink house. - We're not going anywhere, this clinic stays open! - [Jennifer] Live in Jackson, Jennifer Ortega, 16 WABT News. - I am so outdone. Dianne was crying girl. Oh my God and Nancy was crying. Oh my God. Girl I was grinning all the way here, I swear to God. Oh my God my nerves so bad. I was smiling all the way here. I swear to God I couldn't stop. I was driving by myself like I was with somebody in the car. - I saw several women who were crying oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - [Shannon] Ms. Betty was screaming. - [Dr. Parker] We found out about this just as we were walking out of the clinic. So now they have to try and appeal it, which they are gonna do. - That's Instagram, I know you don't know. He said Jackson Women's Health stays open, thank God. I said yeah that's just what the protestors love to hear. Thank God what do they mean by that? Thank God, they believe in God? - [Dr. Parker] You might want to make sure somebody takes a good look around tomorrow before anybody goes in there. Do we have like surveillance cameras at night? - Yeah Irene I'm telling you. That's what I told her, we need to call the FBI and we need to call the commander. Because if something's gonna happen this is when something's gonna happen. - When they don't prevail through legitimate means, then kind of vigilante activity picks up. - You gonna be at the clinic in the morning? Dianne is gonna want you to come up there. That's what we discussing now, to do a good walk around, walk through and stuff. (contemplative music) - So here we are. I'm gonna ask you tonight to mourn. As we pray, let's mourn. We aught to cry. Because unless we're doing something about it, - Come on now, come on. - [Preacher] I can't say that we're pro-life until we take action on it. - Amen. - Amen, yes. - We've been to the Supreme Court. We've been to the halls of Congress. Father God we as a nation have forgotten you. We sing songs about you God while the blood of our children is running under the sewers of our church. Lord the Devil is having a hay day. It's not because our government has failed. It is because we have failed. God forgive us. ♪ Heir of salvation purchase of God ♪ Born of His spirit washed in His blood - Dorenda, get her to come a little bit more over this way. Come on sweetheart let's go ahead and get you inside okay. - [Protestor] Some information with you please. - Can I give you this card? So you can go to a free clinic. - [Shannon] Whenever y'all ready we'll get you inside. - [Protestor] Wonder if I could share this with you please. - [Shannon] Come on honey we'll get you right over here okay - We'd ask you in Jesus name to please have mercy on the unborn. Wonder if I could share this with you please. Won't you let that little baby girl or boy be borned alive mom? Ma'am we'd you to please let us help if we can. We got a Crisis Pregnancy Center, get you any kind of help that you might need. - [Keith] Ladies please, my name's Keith. I want to give you some information. - [Woman] We don't want it. - [Keith] Ma'am are you going to have an abortion? - All-- - lives matter, you damn right they do. We are more than capable of making decisions for our bodies and our lives and our future. - One of my children I was gonna give up for adoption. Because I went to abortion clinic. I remember I came home and I just cried, cried, cried, 'cause I was too far. I was barely making it, I was barely making it. I had just moved to my apartment. I didn't have any furniture. I had a matrass that I had gotten from Salvation Army. And that's what I had in my house. I had children at this time and we slept on the mattress. So when they brought the baby to the room and I picked the baby up and I was hugging the baby. And I just, I decided I could not do it right there at that point. I couldn't have a child come back to me when they turn however old and say why, why. If you have an abortion you don't even know who this would have been. So that's totally two different things and that's what people don't get. It's harder to see your child, and then just hand your child away to somebody. I believe in abortion because, no woman should have to feel the way that I feel. No woman should have to do that, they just shouldn't. - He's such a fucking asshole. Excuse my language. (contemplative music) - [Reporter] Mississippi's only abortion clinic vandalized. Security cameras ripped down, power cords tampered with, and their generator vandalized. Surveillance video may just have captured the prime suspect on camera. - Let me be clear, make no mistake about it, this is a form of domestic terrorism. - We're doing around the clock security. We have someone watching at all times, either on the facility of somewhere close around. (contemplative music) - Number one cause of death in America. God hates the hands that shed innocent blood sir, and you're actually helping them do that right now. You're the part of the system that kills children. Half the black women who get pregnant will have an abortion sir. - [Keith] You don't have to come in here guys. I'm not a protestor I'm a peacemaker. - And make no mistake about it. What you are doing here is wanton, wilful, premeditated murder. - It's the OSA, OSA which is Operation Save America, and AHA which is Abolish Human Abortion, which that's one of the newer groups. There are quite a few of them from the dossier that are here. T Russell, you have Toby. Alright you too, bye bye. She don't know shit. Swear to God I hate talking to the same people. I'm like, she's asking me who's gonna be here, and I'm like is the fucking FBI? That's why I know these people are not gonna protect you. These people are gonna come out the wood works after somebody gets killed. Then they'll come out the wood works and everybody wants to be the hero and say oh I have all your screening there was a this on premise, man please somebody's dead now. I don't care nothing about what you got now. (Shannon sighs heavily) (contemplative music) The truth is out because I know it's something going on. Keith Dawson leads the Jackson, Mississippi chapter of AHA. He has targeted Willie Parker as part of the AHA Call Out the Killers campaign. They have a Call Out the Killers campaign? Now tell me that doesn't look scary. - Okay but who was passing through here early this morning? On a day we supposed to be closed, Keith. - He was on his way to work. - [Shannon] Right, see how you keep justifying Keith out of that. - I'm not justifying Keith, I'm funning with you. The only thing that I was serious about was when she said do you think it was Keith? And I don't think Keith did that. And I don't think Keith would do that. All the other stuff I was bullshitting about. - But my thing is I don't feel that way about anybody from Ms. Esther on, on the other side. Because the fact, but the fact that you're on this side, that bothers me. You don't know nothing about that man when he leaves here. You know what he tells you, what you read on Facebook. You don't know what's in that, that man could be building a bomb in house right now, and come up here smiling in your face every day. We don't know that. - And now I see where the root is of all this. And I was not trying to offend you, upset you, or take or make it seem less serious than what it is. - If anybody let's their guard down, something happens here, something happens to this staff, I feel responsible for all this shit, you don't get that. And for you to say that and I'm thinking she got them out there. You not gonna be able to tell me that. You see what I'm saying? You not gonna tell me he wouldn't do that. I'm sorry, because I don't believe that. I don't believe that he won't do that, I just. - [Guard] I apologize, I do. (contemplative music) - Alright here we are. (contemplative music) Not like, if you've been there for a while you already cautious but you become, you know you become a little relaxed. This kind of wakes me back up you know? Get it together now Shannon, get it together. You know it's some loonies out here, get it together. (laughing) Right here. - Oh alright. My husband was coaching that team. - Mr. Waters? - Yeah. - Ow wow okay, my son's Jarvis. - Oh no no no. I'm the director at the abortion facility here. - [Mrs. Waters] So like are you interested in staying here? - Sure. Wow, oh my God. Wow, ain't that something? Where are you? Are you serious? Wow. The one thing I don't think dealing with like the pro-life places, and I don't know you as far as I don't know a lot about the place where you are. But a lot of these places don't give women the resources they need. It's something that's missing that they're not getting to put them there because me as a woman I know. I have six kids of my own. I know that you can get in these situations and you don't know what you're gonna do. - What we do is we say you have three options. These are your three options. What do you know about each of these options? - Got you. - And then if someone would say well I'm thinking about having an abortion. So then I say tell me everything you know about abortion. To see how much they know about it. - [Shannon] Oh J Boo up. - [Mrs. Waters] Oh is this yours? - [Shannon] This is me yeah. This is the thing when I got pregnant with him, his dad and I were friends. I went to have an abortion, I was too far. I signed papers to have an adoption to get, for my baby to be adopted and everything. And when they brought him to me to see him I called the adoption people and told them I couldn't do it. But that's, and that's that one. That's right, yeah that's my fifth one. Yep I got one under him. And that's just basically what I live everyday for is just to make sure they're good. 'Cause my thing is if you, I am pro-choice because I don't feel the need to judge the next person and tell the next person what to do. Because a lot of the adults that we have, including me, grew up lacking, not materialistic stuff, stuff from here. And then you become, you're lacking that as an adult. And that changes your whole world. Oh it's wild, it is wild. That's okay. Yeah she's a pro-lifer. It wasn't bad, we sat there and talked for a long time. She's pro-life yeah. So it's a good thing. Oh you always got to be so negative about everything baby. (contemplative music) (phone ringing) - How you doing today? - [Barbara] I'm doing good, how are you doing? - I'm tired as ever. Yeah I still do both of them. - [Barbara] Oh my goodness that's just. - Today is, shut up girl. (baby crying) My check didn't come Saturday so I'm hoping it come today so I can do something. Yeah they here, they here now. Okay, okay. - [Barbara] Okay, talk to you later. - Okay. - [Barbara] Bye, bye bye. - [Brother] That was Ms. Barbara? - [April] Yes. - [Brother] Is she coming? - [April] Hi Ricky this is April. I was calling because I haven't received a check today or Saturday. And I just was checking on seeing why it didn't come. (contemplative music) (car approaching) - Love your dress, look this is Aunt Bevy. I brought Aunt Bevy, this is everybody's Aunt Bevy. This is April. We got enchiladas for you. - Not yet. - I'm sorry. Come on Malikye, we want to see you walk. Get up boy. (contemplative music) - [Shannon] Thanks for the enchiladas. (contemplative music) - Yep. Yep, make me some mula. Some more what? - Candy. - Why we always got to buy candy with the money? Let's buy some fish this time. Wanna buy some fish? - [April] Who? - You. - [April] Yep, little dude. - You take your thing with you? - [April] I love you too. (contemplative music) - She wanted to come over last night. Y'all I go to sleep at night. She's up all night probably kinda. Because of the night shift yeah. I think I'm afraid she's gonna burn her, I'm afraid she's bitten off more than, and that's youth, I think that's youth. You've got to learn to pace a little bit. You've got to learn to balance. And my goodness, how much does she have to do? You know it's just, so I'm gonna cry. But sometimes you just need something to keep you going. And April's my call to keep going now. I've had the Lord just intermittently, I'm weeping. Just waiting for it to get easier. It doesn't get easier. We're on the winning side. And there's a glorious day. - [Interviewer] Do you think there's a chance she could get pregnant again? - I'm sure there is, I'm sure there is. I see the solution as self control, as learning how to control ourselves. And plus condoms, they don't prevent even used correctly. There's like a 20% failure rate, even used correctly. There's a relatively high failure rate of condoms. - [Interviewer] I thought if a condom's used correctly it's 98% affective. - Oh I don't believe that. I don't think that's, I don't think that's correct. I would question that. I'll find some of our data. (laughing) Send you some of that, you can look at that. (contemplative music) - 17 weeks and two days. - [Mother] She's too far, she can't do it can she? (contemplative music) - She was too far for us to see her because we only go to 16 weeks. That's what they put these laws in place for. They don't put the laws in place to protect women. And she may not have money to go out of town. And I guess you could say the antis feel like they won. That's the point of it right? So they feel like they saved another one today. But at the same time what did you save? You know what I'm saying? What did you do? You have made a person's life harder. You judged her and you made it harder. Judged all women as a whole, and you made it harder. (contemplative music) - The Supreme Court taking up it's biggest abortion case in nearly 25 years. - Is agreeing to review a Texas law that could force more than three quarters of the states abortion to close. - [Reporter] The Texas trap law does the same thing that Mississippi famously tried to do last year, endangering that state's only remaining clinic. (contemplative music) - [Activist] The fact of the matter is that lives are at stake. Individual lives are at stake. Your lives are at stake. - If they close all the abortion clinics then they think women are gonna stop having abortions. They were having abortions before they made it legal. What makes them think they can stop it now? (cheering and applauding) - Somebody once said life is not fair but the law should be. (cheering and applauding) And these trap laws are not fair to the women of this country. I flew in last evening from Jackson, Mississippi. (cheering and applauding) Yesterday I saw a woman from Louisiana. Now that state will only have one clinic because of recent changes in the law. She told me that she works as a health administrator in an ER and that they were seeing women there with complications from do it yourself medications on the internet. And when I told her I was gonna be here she said you make sure that you tell them up there what's happening down here. (cheering and applauding) In November I want you to vote as if women's lives depend on it because they will. (cheering and applauding) (contemplative music) - I think they'll be fair. But at the same time of course we know that this won't be the end of anything. Soon as you're too happy and say okay this is great, there just come something else. (contemplative music) ♪ Have you been to Jesus for his cleansing power ♪ Are you washed in the blood of the lamb ♪ Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour ♪ Are you washed in the blood of the lamb - [Barbara] We understand that, we're okay. ♪ Are you washed are you washed ♪ In the blood in the blood ♪ In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb ♪ Are your garments spotless are they white as snow ♪ Are you washed in the blood of the lamb - Okay we're on go here. (applauding) I'm Barbara Beavers, and we are just so blessed to have each of you here. We have a part to play in ending abortion. The CPC can be there when a young woman finds out for the first time that she's pregnant. She's terrified, and she's dead set on having an abortion. And because of your investment that mother can make a decision to save the life of her child. We want to offer hope to more women who are open to receiving that hope. And the closer you can get the CPC to the abortion clinic, then the closer you can get a woman to choose life for her child. Having a place just walking distance is huge. Because a lot of times these women are dropped off. That's the greatest need for the CPC to be as close as to that abortion clinic as we can get it. Please consider how you might partner with us so that hand in hand through the power of Jesus Christ we might walk through those doors together. (applauding) You take a flower, from me. - I was thinking when you was talking. I want to come to the center and help since I don't-- - Okay, okay. - Maybe tell my story too. - Yeah, yeah, good, good. Oh bless you. Oh thank goodness, with that all happening I was in favor. (contemplative music)
