Hello. This way. -Can we see him now? -Well, he's expecting you. She's so excited about this, you wouldn't imagine! We got a nice pup for you. Not those. Those are racing dogs. They're in training. -How many are there? -About fifty. -Is he here? -He's in the last kennel. He was really young when he was abandoned. He's kinda big, though, huh? -Hey. -He's a year old. A year old? -Come here, Ulysses! -Come here! He's vaxxed, healthy and harmless. -He's so cute. -He is! Can I have him, Dad? Can I have him, please? All right, OK. But you'll take care of him, huh? Yeah, I promise. I promise I'll take care of him. My baby. Daddy? -Is all of this ours? -Yeah. The entire forest? All of this? Yeah. And even way further back! Oh, yeah? All the way over there, there's this huge pond. -Can we go there? -Of course we can. We can swim there, row the boat. Watch out. Come on! Come here! Here you are! This could work for the staircase. Yeah, that's great. Can I have a minute? Yes? Look, I think she won't be nagging us about a little sister for a while. HOTEL Hello. Hello. I... I'm looking for a room. -Are you over 18? -Yes. -Any ID on you? -Yes. Thank you, give me a second. PIERRE DRAHI'S DAUGHTER JEANNE BACK IN FAMILY HOME All right. -Thank you. -Here you go. Thank you. And here you go. Do I need to pay now? No, you'll pay me when you leave. OK. No, take it! It's for you. For the clients. Plenty of tips in there, we're in a beautiful region. Right, Mom? It's upstairs. Thank you. You OK? Do you want to eat something? I'm coming. I got to interview your father just before he left us. Is it a weird feeling, having to take his place? No, I'm not taking his place. But it... It... No, I'm happy to keep my father's legacy alive. But I think that... the publishing world has evolved tremendously and I want to push new authors. Yes, I think that Jeanne is... How can I put it? I had a lot of admiration for her father, but what I really appreciate with Jeanne is that she follows her heart. Her father did too, but she's bringing something new, with her youth, her curiosity. I believe it's a very difficult job, and following in his footsteps, I mean, the torch has been passed on with some sort of new... a new approach. And for you, is it overwhelming, having to come here with such a tutelary figure? Sure, but it also entails some responsibilities. And you know... How could I put it? It's like there's a ghost, as if he were still here, and it pushes me to work hard. Work, work! That was the motto... Yeah, yeah. This is actually how I grew up. Let's talk about your upcoming novel. I was wondering about your approach for the next stage, following the success of your first novel. Yes, Inexorable was... It was a surprise. But, authors should never think about that. -You don't write to... -To please people. You write because it's a vital need. We'll have to seal off the stairway, we'll use the service stairs, OK? I've been looking for Ulysses for an hour, I can't find him. Paola? Paola? Yes? -Oh, have you seen the dog? -No. Help me find him, Lucie is freaking out! Ulysses! Ulysses! Ulysses! Ulysses! Mom! Mom, here he is! Ulysses! Ulysses... Oh, awesome! I found him on the road so I thought I'd come in. Oh, thank you! Tragedy avoided. We just got him. That dog's out of control. He's just a bit young... Paola, can you please get my purse? Yes. I've got a little something for you. -Oh, no, no, it's OK, really. -I insist. -No, really. I gotta go. -I'm Jeanne. Nice to meet you. My daughter's name is Lucie and the dog's name is Ulysses. -How about a drink? -No, really. Come on, I'd be happy to. Let's go. Do you live around here? No. Actually, I was born here. And then you moved out? Well, when I was little, my parents died in a car crash. So I moved in with several foster families. -I'm sorry. -It's OK. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. So, you just came back, huh? Yeah. Oh, what's wrong? He won't listen to me. Do you want me to show you? Yeah! May I? You don't mind? No, not at all. Are you good with dogs? Yes, I love them. Sure. Need some pointers? -Yeah. Let's go. -Come on. Thank you! Sit. You got to go: "Sit!" Sit! Good boy! -Wanna throw it? -Yeah. Come here! Go get it! Attaboy! Fetch! Come on. Good boy. He told me that on all three levels, the stairway is collapsing. We'd have to redo the entire stairway. If you're not listening, it's not very... No. I am listening. -I was thinking about something. -Yes The house is huge. I don't have to... use your father's office, I could use another room... It... It's a bit awkward... But I like you in his office. -Is that true? -Yes. I feel like a usurper. No! It's nice, you're keeping the office alive. This is where you belong now. We'll be fine. Will you write to me? Of course. -What's the matter? -You're kind of heavy. No, no, you're crushing me. -That's not nice. -No, it wasn't true... -Did I put on some weight? -No, no, no. Hold on, hold on... -Did you hear that? -No. I heard something. Where's Lucie? Sleeping, with the dog. I left her door open. Let's check on her. Oh, no... It's a fuse. Can you get the dog out of here? Come here! Come on! Come here! No! Come on, come here! -Hello, Gloria. How are you? -Fine. Thanks for being here. Go! Come! Here you go! Fetch, Ulysses! Fetch! Like that? Yeah, you go: "Fetch." Fetch! Come here. OK, I'm gonna go. No, stay. Please, stay. No, it's getting late. -You did a good job. -Oh, no, no. It's normal. You did the work, it's normal. Well, thank you. See? That's good! Oh, Marcel, come here! I want to introduce you to Gloria. Yes! Daddy, look. Ulysses, gimme your paw! Gimme your paw! Hey! Ulysses, Ulysses! Gimme! Look. -Hi, Gloria. -Hi. Marcel, Gloria. Look, Dad. His little paw. -See? -I'm impressed. Yes, huh? All thanks to Gloria. Well, congrats. Thank you. Congratulations, my boy. Good boy. Oh, Paola, it's time for your bath. Yes. -Bye. -Bye. See you tomorrow. Thank you. How's it going with the dog? -See you tomorrow? -All right. -Bye. -Bye. She's great, huh? Can you give her a ride? Gloria? I'll give you a ride, where do you live? -In the village. -Well, let's go! Thank you for trusting me, you and Lucie. Well... I'm really honored. I love the stuff you do. Oh, did you read my books? Yes. Especially Inexorable. It's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Really? Thank you. -Did you read any others? -Yes, all of them. Gloria, what happened? No, no, it's nothing. Something happened... What happened to you? No, it's... yesterday, this man was trying to take my money and... and I didn't want to give it to him, so he hit me. Oh, my God, we need to call someone. Wait, I... I'm OK. After Marcel dropped you off? Yeah. He took everything I had. Thanks to Gaston Leroux, Agatha Christie started writing crime novels. She read The Mystery of the Yellow Room and it inspired her to write her own novel. Everybody was like: "I don't think you're capable." Reading that book, she thought: "I'll give it a try." -Agatha Christie. -Yes, right... But when did Leroux write? -I forgot. -1930. Just when you were starting out. You never felt like retiring? Do I really come off as senile to you? -No! -No, that's not it. If my mind is still there, and my legs can still hold me up, I'll keep going. You're in great shape! Jacques is a true country doctor, like they used to make them. I'm not so old. Wait, you might've known Gloria's parents? Oh... Are they from around here? They were, yes. Oh, sorry. -Are you done? -Yeah. Yes, thank you, Paola. Are you still staying at that hotel? Yes, but I'm not sure where I'll be able to go next, but... Gloria, we have a huge house, plenty of empty rooms. We could let you stay here until you find something. The yellow room is free. There you go! Excellent idea! We were just talking about the yellow room... Oh, no, I'll... I'll find something else. You're welcome to stay here. Really. The house is huge. Next to my room. I can't impose. We're the ones who asked you! It's fine, Gloria, it's easier for everyone. Well? -Well, OK. Thanks. -Awesome. Wise decision. It's official! -Welcome. -Welcome. -Welcome, Gloria. -Thank you. -That's really nice of you. -No, I'm happy to help out. You have a big window overlooking the park. Voilà. Plenty of sunlight. Here, you have a kitchenette with a couple of hotplates and everything. This is the bathroom. The sheets for the bed are in the closet. If you need to get some groceries, ask Paola. If you need the car, just ask me. The same goes for the laundry. OK. I used the "tu" form, do you mind? No, not at all. It's simpler. I lost my dad too, not too long ago... Sorry, I didn't know. No. You'll feel at home, here. Thank you. I'll let you settle in. -Gloria? -Yes? Can you come here for a minute, please? I'm coming. I'm here. I'm in the office. Do you have a driver's license? Yes. Oh, great. -Do you mind taking Lucie to school? -Not at all. Oh, nice, that helps me out. You can also go to the hotel to pay the bill. Well, I thought I had more cash in here. Not the first time that's happened. Yeah, Lucie said. What did she say? Well, about Paola. Well, what about Paola? Well... Nothing. No, go ahead. What is it? No, no, it's just that... Lucie told me that... Paola's been taking money from the wallet, but... Thank you. Here are the car keys. Watch out, it's got a powerful engine. And for the hotel, I'm giving you this. -Here. -Thank you. Thank you. Ulysses. Hop in. -Are you buckled up? -Yeah. Since I have my doubts, I can't keep you. But I've never stolen from anyone... I'm sorry, but I don't know you well enough, Paola. Well, yes, but... I'm not sure it was the right time to fire her. She's a shady person. Do you think I could ask Gloria to take care of Lucie? Why would she need to? Because I'm leaving for two days, I'm off to see Barbier who's hassling us about his book. No problem, yes. Oh, tomorrow, the seamstress is coming over for Lucie's birthday dress. All right. Can you say something nice to me? I love you. Here you go. Look at you! It's splendid! I don't like it. What do you mean? It's a splendid dress, isn't it? Oh, dear... That's what I want. Oh, that one's very pretty too. Yes, but I don't think her mom will be OK with that. Mom isn't here. We could get both. Hold on. Excuse me. Please. Why do you... The red one... Here, this one is... -It's too big. -It's too big, yes. This one's pretty. Right, Gloria? Very pretty. Right? You could wear it for my birthday. Oh, yes, that's a great idea. Do you have a dress for the birthday? No. -Want to try it on? -Go ahead! Excellent idea. Follow me. We'll try it on. -Thanks, ma'am. -You're welcome. Come with me. It's a good deed! You're so beautiful. -I hope... -No, no, go ahead! Hold on. Daddy! Stop! Listen up! Where are the crawfish? I'm the apex predator here. Gloria, you're not swimming? I'm good. Come on, boy! My baby! Ulysses! Daddy! Do you think they'll eat a slice of salami? Maybe. They don't eat salami. Oh, it did eat it! Oh, no! Well. Thank you. Hey... What if we did that to you? What if we took you out, dipped your head in the water, and fed you salami... Yeah. They seem to like it. Are you OK, Gloria? I've never seen anything so beautiful. Lucie is finally asleep. Should I turn off the lights? No. Don't you want to share this? -I wouldn't want to bother you. -Oh, no! -I'll get you a glass. -All right. -Impressive, huh? -Yes. Do you like it here? Yes, a lot. Who is it? Jeanne's grandmother. She's beautiful. She was quite the character. Antoinette. A very intelligent, beautiful lady. And she had the misfortune of marrying... a cupid, cynical boy. How so? An ambitious, very handsome boy. He took advantage of her and scaled all the ranks of the Rexist regime. Ever heard of Rexism? No. It was Belgium's answer to fascism. In the '30s, it was very popular and the husband literally became Léon Degrelle's right-hand man. He was the Belgian Hitler... Anyway... He went on to dilapidate his fortune, he... Well, he cheated on her, he... And in '44, he felt the tide swing, and he ran away, like a coward. What about Antoinette? She was accused of high treason, arrested, and sentenced, and she let herself die of love... in prison. No, I know. It sounds very romantic, but you know, nowadays, nobody ever dies of love anymore, there's nothing to worry about. You know, Jeanne told me about your parents. How awful. Well, it's happened a long time ago. Why am I talking about this? It's none of my business. -Sorry. -Actually, it is. How so? After the crash, I read your book at least 100 times. You kind of saved me. Thank you. May I ask another question, sir? Don't call me "sir." Of course. Ask away. How long have you been writing? Seven years. I mean, since I was seven. You were writing novels at seven? No, I wrote letters. I wrote to my mother. I wrote to her, and she'd never reply. So, I came up with my own replies. And then... But where's your mother now? I only have one family. Jeanne and my daughter. Where did you meet Jeanne? Excuse me. Here we go. Back then, I had penned my first novel that nobody wanted. I had to do all kinds of odd jobs, and I worked in this bar. And one day, Jeanne walked in. She worked for her father, who was a publisher. And we hooked up a few times, and then she published... Inexorable? Inexorable, yes. Excuse me. Yes? How are you, honey? No, no, no. FOR JEANNE What's this? -Well, it's the sun! -Give it a smile. That's nice. It's Mom! Come here, Ulysses. Mom? -Hey, sweetie pie! -Mom! My little sweetie pie. -How are you? -Good. -How did everything go? -Fine. Yeah? -Let me get this. -OK. Can you handle it? -Hello, Gloria! -Hello. -How did it go? -Great. That's pretty. -Is he in his office? -Yes, I think so. Oh, Gloria. We talked yesterday with Marcel over the phone and we'd love to have you work here full-time. Yes! All right. -Really? -Yeah! -Oh, awesome. -OK. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. -We went swimming. -Yes? Daddy too. When he jumped in, it was funny, he looked like a lizard. Oh, yeah? We found two crawfish, it wasn't much. And then, we put them back in the pond. -What about your dress? Tell me. -I don't like it much. I wanted to wear the red one. No, you're wearing the blue one for your birthday. Even Gloria thinks the red one's prettier, and Daddy too. We'd agreed on this. You're wearing the blue one for your birthday. -OK... -All right. By the way, did you see Gloria's dress? -It's pretty, huh? -Yes, I... -Dad bought it for her. -Oh, yeah? So she can wear it for my birthday. Oh, that's nice. She's really pretty. Yes, she's really pretty. I'd love to be like her when I grow up. -Oh, yes? -Yeah. Do you think she'd say yes if I ask her to be my sister? I'm sure she would. She would love that. -Don't worry, it's just a fuse. -OK. It happens in older houses. -Good night. -Love you. Sweet dreams, honey. -Should I let the dog stay? -Yes. Good night! ... and then, he leaves... His mother... That's what's so moving. You coming, dear? I'm coming. -Gloria, good night. -Good night. Good night, Gloria. If I were to quit smoking, I'd stop with the ones I smoke in bed. Perhaps we ought to learn to smoke with... Can you stop talking to yourself? -The unnecessary cigarettes... -Hush. -Like this one, for instance? -Oh, no, that one... Oh, I love it when you smell of cigarettes. Your smell turns me on. -Really? -Yeah. -Tell me again. -Fuck me. Yeah. Fuck me. Yes, I want you to fuck me. Oh, yes... Hold on. -You caught me off guard. -Yes... Hold on, any requests? Show me your boobs. Oh, yes... Hold on. Wow. Go ahead. No, but... What? No, no, hold on. -Why? -Stop, stop. Why? It's not going to work. I'm... I got distracted. -I'm sorry... -No, no. It's no big deal. Can I do anything to help? Any requests? No, don't do that, please. -What? Don't do what? -Don't do that. It can happen to anyone. Sure. No, it's normal. I mean, it happens. It's OK. I mean, I'm not upset with you. She caught me off guard. That's all. Caught me off guard. Do you want some juice? Yes, please. Thank you. Did you enjoy school when you were little? No. Do you like school? Well, I get bored. I have no friends. It's normal, you just haven't met them yet. -Are you done with the butter? -Yes. -You OK? -Yes. Are you sure? Well, ladies, you better hurry up now. But she stained her dress. Did you do your list of friends for the party? No. Well, you need to do it, honey. Otherwise, nobody will come. I don't have any friends... Well, this is your opportunity. Invite the whole class, you want. Can I perform a show? Yeah, you can perform a show. We'll have a nice party. Right, Gloria? What are you doing, Gloria? I stained my dress. Well, you shouldn't be working in that kind of dress. Get changed. -Come on, hurry up, girls! -Yeah. "We'll have a nice party. Right, Gloria?" By the way, I talked to the guy from City Hall. Remember that beautiful theater we saw the other day. They'd like to invite you for a reading. No, forget about it. It's a really nice theater! No, too old-fashioned. It's not old-fashioned at all, if I'm asking you! If you're the one doing the reading... It's classy. Oh, I'd be doing the reading? I haven't done that in a while. And you read so well. Gloria! Well, don't just stand there, clean it up! No, no, no! You'll get burned. No, I'll do it. It's OK, I'll take care of it. It's OK, no big deal. I'll take care of it. Sorry. Good night. You shouldn't talk to people like that. She's so clumsy... No, that's no way to talk to people. She's young, you... -Give me your plate. -Not for me. -Eat some beans. -No! Eat some beans! Dad isn't eating them! Daddy will also eat his beans! Don't talk back and give me your plate! I'll have some beans. Come on. Twice, this morning! With the coffee, and now the dish... I mean... You... I mean... -What? -Nothing, it's... Gloria? Something wrong? Wait! Gloria, wait! Gloria, what's going on? Huh? I mean, you... Come on, you can talk to me. What is it? What's wrong? -It's Jeanne. -Jeanne? What? Because of that dish? It's OK. She's mean to me. With Jeanne, you just do what she asks, and she'll leave you alone. "Is there a way to understand love "without first becoming the one who's in love? "The man realized he was in love for the first time." But that's my novel you're... You know it by heart? No! No, no, this is wrong. This is wrong. No. Yes? Sorry, my bad. First of all, "my bad" won't cut it. You should say: "I apologize for what I did." As a publisher's daughter, it's the bare minimum. I apologize for what I did. OK. Well, apology accepted. I don't know what got into me, I... I keep messing up. I can sense you're not happy. I'm neither happy nor unhappy. I'll let you work, then. Hold on! Hold on. You have a bunch of stuff to make up for, don't you? I don't know. You do have stuff to make up for, you know it. -How would you make up for that? -I dunno. -You're a slut, aren't you? -I dunno. Are you a slut? Are you a slut? I dunno. Could you be a slut? I could be your slut! All right, you can be my slut. We'll see if you're a whore who can open her thighs. Oh, it's OK. You're wet. Of course you are. You're wet because you're a slut. Oh, yes! My show will be awesome. Will you help me? Yes. I mean, it depends. On what? Well, on whether your mom asks me to leave or not. Why would she do that? It's complicated, but I think your mom doesn't like me. No, that's impossible. I even asked her if you could be my sister, she said yes. I promise you she likes you. -Is it true? -Yeah. Do you want that too? -To be your sister? -Yeah. Well yes, of course. At the start of the show, you're walking through the audience. All of the sudden, the music starts. As the music gets louder, you transform. Do you get what I'm saying? Yeah. You start at the bottom, you lift yourself up, shouting... Like a war cry, you know? And then, you start walking again, you approach people, you look them in the eyes... Marcel! I'm sorry... about yesterday. No, it's me. It's me. -You don't want to talk anymore? -Yes, I do... It's because I'm not wearing the dress? Dress? What dress? Jeanne made me do that. Marcel? Hold on, hold on! No, stay, stay! Kiss me! -No, I can't. -Marcel? -Kiss me! -No, no... Fuck. I want you to leave this house right now. Do you understand? Huh? Did you understand? Did you see what you did? -Yeah, but I'm going to stay. -No. No, no. If you tell Jeanne, I'll tell her you banged me. She won't believe you, you know? I'll tell her about the letters. Letters? Letters? What letters? Oh, fuck... No. No. I'm sure Harry will be able to fix the stairway. The budget he sent me isn't that bad. Oh, by the way, we're having dinner on Friday. Is it OK with you? He pisses me off. "Harry, Harry, Harry..." He pisses me off. What's wrong? I wonder what you like about him. I'm not even sure he has the skills. Go write your novel and stop being a pain! -Oh, no. -What, no? Low blow. No, it's not a low blow. -What happened to you? -No, nothing. It's nothing. There's blood. No, it's nothing. What the fuck is this? It's nothing, it's a little... It... Come on! What happened, Marcel? -Nothing. -What is it? Tell me, explain yourself! I was bitten. Ulysses bit me. Ulysses bit you? When? Well, I was walking him, I wanted to pull him away from a female. And you should never separate dogs. It's not a bite, he pinched me. He bit your neck? Because I was crouching. Jeanne, I crouched to separate the dogs and then, he... Please. Hold on! And you left the dog with Lucie? What are you doing? Nothing, sweetie. Go back to sleep! Gloria, it's me. Open up! Listen to me. Listen to me... there's a misunderstanding. I was a bit too cavalier, sorry. Open this fucking door! Give me my letters! I want my letters back. We gotta get rid of him. -What? -Yes, honey. I know. -What are you saying? -I'm sorry. Daddy, what's going on? He bit you? It's impossible! I know Ulysses, he never bit anybody! Sweetie. It's an accident, all right? If he bit once, he can bite again. Mom, he didn't bite him! My dog doesn't bite. Marcel, tell her. Why are you saying this? I know he doesn't bite. No way he bit you! It won't happen again. I must've scared him... You need to be brave, sweetie. You can't do this. It's not fair! He didn't bite him, I know it! OK, Marcel, please call the vet. No. No, no, let's keep our wits together. Why? Why would we call the vet? What for? Huh? Can you get Gloria? Mom, that dog never bit anybody. Go get Gloria. I swear, if anything happens to Lucie I'll be holding you responsible. What are you going to do? Are you going to put it down? He's dangerous! I mean, it makes sense, right? Gloria, from now on, I want that dog wearing a muzzle 24/7, OK? -Is that clear? -24/7? 24/7, yes! All right. This is so unfair. Honey, this conversation is over, thank you. Mom, Ulysses didn't bite him. I know it. I know my dog, he never bit anybody! Congrats. -Do you want to try it on? -Yeah. Bark! MARCEL BELLMER'S FIRST NOVEL. A MEGALOMANIAC'S MUSINGS JEANNE DRAHI-BELLMER BACK IN FAMILY HOME Jeanne. That girl, where do you know her from exactly? Huh? Gloria? Yes. Where do you know her from? What do you know about her? I mean it, what do you know about her? -I dunno... -Where's she from? Relax. What's wrong? Marcel, what the... You asked me a question, let me answer it! -Can you bark? -Woof! Gloria! Oh, no... Gloria! Oh, my... I asked you to leave the muzzle on that dog! She's the one who needs a muzzle. The dog must... -What? What did you say? -Nothing. Repeat what you just said. Oh... I said you're the one who could use a muzzle. You need to leave this house right now. I don't want to see you here. Move it! What a jerk! -What the hell are you doing? -I'm saving you, honey. But I don't care! Why would you do this? -You... -You ruin everything! It's not his fault! Ulysses never bit anybody!

Identity unknown. Unknown? Sir, are you there? Yes, I'm here... And the mother died... Did she die? You're asking too much of me, Mr. Bellmer. Can I just ask you what her first name is? Élisabeth.

You look so united when you're together. How long have you guys been married? 25 years next summer. And you never had any problems? Nothing? Punctuality! I had a problem with Gloria. She insulted me, I fired her. Good. What's the matter, Marcel? You were unreachable all day. What were you up to? I'll explain when we get home. All right? -Fuck, that does it... -No, Jeanne, wait! What the hell are you doing here? Ulysses bit me! -What? -Come here. -What are you doing? -Let's all go home. -Why? -I'm bringing her back home! Get in the car! Gloria? -Come here, honey, get out! -Gloria! Where are we going? To the train station. We're leaving? Together? No! Fuck! What do you want? Huh? -I want you! -Money, is that it?

And we can take Lucie with us and be happy. -Listen to me... -Please, Marcel. You're insane. No! I can change. Where did you put my letters? Where are they? In your office! Marcel, it's me, I'm your inexorable love. No! Get out! Get out of this car! You can't do this! You can't leave! Don't leave. Please, don't leave. Get out! Get out! No! No! You can't do this! Leave! Get out! Get out! Get out, goddammit! Lucie... What's going on? Daddy! What's going on, sweetie? What is it? She killed Ulysses! She killed him... I called the vet so he could take in the dog. She killed Ulysses! Calm down. Come here. Please. FOR JEANNE, FROM GLORIA IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND LOVE SOMEDAY YOU WILL NEED TO BECOME THE ONE WHO'S IN LOVE -Who gave you those letters? -What is this? They're mine. Give them back. What's this? -Nothing. -Who wrote them? It's... my first love. Your first love? 1995... In '95, we hadn't hooked up yet in '95. I left her when I met you. Who wrote them? Our breakup didn't go down well with this young woman. So she kept writing to me. I kept her letters, out of sentimentalism. What happened to that girl? She died. She died. She killed herself. Give it back, it's mine. Let me read that fucking letter. "If you want to understand love someday, "you will need to become the one who's in love." That's from Inexorable. Right? It's from Inexorable. You never wrote anything, you've been lying from the start! You never wrote a single line of that shitty novel, and had the gall to dedicate it to me! Huh? You never wrote anything, huh? You've been lying to me for 25 fucking years! 25 years... Calm down. Shut up! Shut up, shut up, you liar... I'm begging you. That girl is destroying our lives. Think about it. Look at what she's doing. Gloria did this. Why did she hand you those letters? I ask you to forgive me. I'm begging you. Forgive me. Tomorrow, it's Lucie's birthday. After that, I want you gone. No, please... Get out. Daddy? What are you doing? What's this? No, no, listen to me. Listen to me. I had an argument with Mom, OK? I need to go away for a while. It'll be better for us. But I won't be very far. OK? Can I come with you? No. No, my little angel, no. Daddy? Did Ulysses really bite you? Did he do it? No. -He didn't? -No. Oh... Hey! Look, Mom. So, did you hire her? Sorry? That girl you were looking for the other day, at the hotel. You should've seen her this morning in her pretty little dress... I asked her: "Did you dress up for me?" That made Mom laugh. She told her she was going away on vacation. She went to pick up her little sister and they're going together. But you probably knew that. Wait! Answer your phone... Hey. Hi, there. Gloria, you came back. -Happy birthday, Lucie. -I missed you. -Is it for me? -Yes. -Where's your dad? -At the hotel. -Why? -He had an argument with my mom. You know what we're gonna do? We'll go and get him. Together, OK? And bring him home? -Yes. We'll bring him home. -All right. -Are you coming? -Yes. Come here. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Really? -Come here. We'll take your mom's car, it'll be faster. Come on, we need to hurry. Lucie, come here. I don't want to come. -Why not? -I don't want to hurt Mom's feelings. I don't want to lie. She won't even notice we're gone. Come on. Lucie! Lucie, come here! No! Open the door! -Lucie! -No, no! Lucie! Stop! Step back! Let her go! Please, Gloria! Jeanne! Marcel! Stop! Gloria, let her go! Gloria, let her go! This is how he fucked me! Stop! Shut the fuck up! Shut your fucking mouth! Fuck! You fucking bitch! No. No, no! No! No! Hold on! Get in there! FEATURING A FILM BY FABRICE DU WELZ
