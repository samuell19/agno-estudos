When we go to 'New Love Country"... we'll take a big boat too. It will be the 'Big Migration' of our youth. We'll realize our modern miracle. It is not a miracle. - What? - What is that? What was that? The Moon Mask Rider? No way. - Alright, let's go. - OK. He robbed us. Damn, it was the Moon Mask Rider. The darkness of evil... will come to the light of the moon. Shut up. Come out. Come out. Damn. So the ¥500,000,000 were there. Really. Anything else? We found a few fingerprints on the hearse... they have no previous record. Alright, thanks. Boss. We searched the hearse in the record... the number came out. Boss. Of course, it was to be expected. Don't be too loud you'll scare the new girl. Sorry. But how did they run? You're asking me , idiot? Ah, going nowhere. The coast guards searched Kawasaki and Yokohama... but they found nothing. Sergeant Honma is requested... I knew I'd find you here. Even as my son-in-law... you can't wander in the police station. You're just a cultural journalist. I've been researching on the 'New Love Country'... and the young people running away from home. There seems to be a connection between those two. What's that 'New Love Country'? Hm? I don't quite know who they are yet. The editor assigned it to me... asking me to write a sensational article. If I was your editor, I'd send you to a desert island. ¥1,500,000,000 evaporated in nature. You wouldn't know what those Red Masks want? Damn it. A cultural reporter from Maicho Daily. His name is Toyohashi Kosuke. A cultural reporter? He came for an interview on the 'New Love Country'. I refused and... he's been snooping ever since. I'll crush him. Ignore him. Let's see what he wants. The Moon Mask Rider. When do they end the meeting? That Moon Mask Rider... targeted us and stole our money. Master won't let it pass. Damn bastard. Next time I'll kill him. But... who is the Moon Mask Rider? Mr. Obara, I didn't know you were coming. Are you OK? A bat again? Too many bats here. But I see you've been training. George Obara, 30. A nature scientist who came back from America, 3 years ago. To establish 'New Love Country'... he's been doing research on the island. OK, next camera. She's royalty. According to Rajah... the diamonds on her necklace... are worth a few thousand million yen. however there is a 24-hour surveillance on her. Can we make it. We can. On March, 8... from 3 to 4 pm... a one hour opening. Yes, bureau of investigation. Inspector Matsuda? About the Red Masks' case? Right, OK... Who are you? If you don't tell us your name... Hello, Inspector Matsuda speaking. The ¥500,000,000 from the armored truck... I'm giving them back. Who are you? But I'll take a 10% commission. 10%? What time and place? Tomorrow 5 pm. - In Ginza. - What street? Palm reading This is ¥200. The top ones are ¥300. It's ¥1200. Excuse me. Would you have a light? Hello dad. What's going on today? You look so smart. - You took a day off? - No. Who is she Dad?. - Hey, am I late? - No, no. - I'll carry it. - OK. You said he was a police inspector?

Here's for you, just go now. - Wow, but why? - Just take it and go. - Thanks dad. - Thank you, sir. - I won't say anything to Mom. - Go away. Hey, Mr. Lion, can we take a photo? Come on, come on. Ready? Look at the camera. Hey come on, look at the camera. Ready? Indian. Indian. What's that? Sorry, one second. It's OK, rest assured. Excuse me. Wait. Keep a distance. A bomb? Look it's the Moon Mask Rider. - Where? - Up there. Cool. Money. Boss, it's money. No one needs to know. Sorry. Masato? That son of mine. Look up there, it's beautiful. - That idiot. - Excuse me. - Matsuda. - Yes? But? Inspector Matsuda. This is a gift for your hard work. However, I took a 10% commission. Moon Mask Rider. On March, 5... in Otaku, Kugahara... on block 3, road 8... the ¥500,000,000 stolen by the Red Masks... today, at 3 PM... a man named the Moon Mask Rider... returned that amount, minus 10%. What's that about? What do you mean "minus 10%"? In other words... he took exactly 10%. So he returned 90% of the money. So he didn't return the whole amount? That's right, ¥450,000,000. Why is that? He said he took a commission. A commission? The Moon Mask Rider... appeared in Ginza... he returned the stolen money. Justice commission 10%. What do you think of the Moon Mask Rider? He's cheeky. What do you think? Hm, he's a bit pretentious. Isn't he imitating the Harajuku dancers with his suit? It brings back memories. It was 22-23 years ago if I remember correctly. That's right. He was the hero of our generation. There are no heroes like him nowadays. "Gekko Kamen"?... No. 'Moon Mask Rider'. Moon? What do you think of the Moon Mask Rider taking 10%? Even though it was stolen... his 10% commission be considered a crime. I wonder what the police will do. A modern hero with a sense of business. Do you like the Moon Mask Rider? Yes, when I grow up I want to be the Moon Mask Rider. But the Moon Mask Rider is a man. Then I will marry him. Thank you, thank you very much. - Hey, dad. - Hm? Who's the Moon Mask Rider? Hm. Who do you think he is? Hm... I'm sure he's amazing and cool. He Appears like a swift wind. He passes by like a swift wind. Who is the Moon Mask Rider? - Ah, good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Excuse me. - Hey. - Yes? Have a good day. Masato, take a good meal. We don't know who he is or where he came from. Is he regularly attending school? He does way too many activities. I found him dancing in Ginza yesterday. It's already been a month, no signs of him. Furthermore, in Tokyo... the cause of the accident is still unknown. How do we tackle the refugees situation? The factory managers will be questioned again. [Rescue the refugees of the disaster] You people over there... what happened? Even now... I feel the tears... flowing from my eyes. I don't have... that much power. But what about... talking with me. Grandma, it's money. There's so much. For the kids' happiness. Moon Mask Rider. The Moon Mask Rider gives away ¥50,000,000. Moon Mask Rider Love & rescue - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mastuda. - Good morning. That Moon Mask Rider is such a good guy. Hmm. They say he gave ¥50,000,000 to the refugees. It's hard to believe. His gesture is difficult to understand. The problem is to find the Moon Mask Rider. He probably knows a lot about the case. Yes. The Red Masks gang must be enraged. A bargain sale for humanism? Who cares about that self-righteous servant of the system. That damned Moon Mask Rider. We must get him off our case. Kuroki, why don't you speak? It's nothing. Kuroki... do you know something about him? He's just the cops' pawn... there's nothing to fear. But... The Moon Mask Rider... is our declared enemy. He's... He's just a thief. One thing is sure... on Ginza street that day... he was probably in the crowd. Was he the clown? Or was he in the rat's disguise? Or that young dancer? Or maybe the cultural journalist? Enough. Whoever he is, we don't care. Those who stand in our way must be erased. I can't remember. Tojoji Residence Tojoji Kyosaku. He's a loan shark who controls the financial world. Counting the diamonds, there's at least 1 billion yen... sleeping in his safe. We know that for sure. Targeting such individual helps us destroy the political system​. That's right. For our ideals. That's what we should do. Master... Let's take a few young people on the island for this mission. Wait. They don't need to take risks for our ideals. Kuroki. You're too soft. How can one reach a dream without getting involved? I thought you had dropped such scruples a long time ago. We can do it ourselves. Our youth are different. How can they be different? Our youth share the same ideals as us. We're one in mind and body. And... we can't afford to fail. They're too young to take risks. Kuroki. For our success we can lose one or two of them. How can you say that? Enough. If it's important for Kuroki... let's do it his way. Go to the island. We don't care if they suspect something... don't let anyone out of the island. Call Makimura and launch the action. Yes. But it's weird, isn't it? The Tax Agency doing an investigation... in the middle of the night? Isn't that a false alarm? Shut up, just hurry up. Anyway, the Tax Agency are just a bunch of crooks. I shed blood and tears for this money. Y-you, who are you? Ca-ca-ca... ca-cash, my cash... Stop. What are you guys doing? Didn't I pay you enough to protect me... you're all fired. My cash, my precious cash. Stop. Master, what's wrong? Moon Rider, show yourself. What's that noise? The sound of that bike... It's the Moon Mask Rider. Kuroki? I'll fight without it. Master. Who are they? Kuroki, wait. Hey. Damn, bastard. Moon Rider... let him go. Kuroki, shoot, shoot. Tommy. Moon Rider... show yourself. Is this what you call Justice? You believe you can do any harm in the name of love? What do you know? You would never understand our noble ideals. You're just a common thief wrapped in a cloak of justice. Say what you will. I'm a hero of love. Damn it. Nothing was taken you say? That can't be, Mr. Tojoji. You mean those Red Masks hooligans... just came to fight with your houseboys. Right, a complete waste of time. If they have so much energy... why don't they use it to earn an honest living. Really. Plus I'll pay the hospital bill for the houseboys. Paying for a doctor is like giving money to a thief. I'll have to talk about it to Mr. Suzuki, tomorrow. Who's Mr. Suzuki? I'll check the flights for Seoul tomorrow. Do that. Stop this game. There's no way the Red Masks would come for nothing. Tell me Mr. Tojoji, are there facts you'd rather not tell the police? This is so rude. You're treating me like a criminal. The perpetrators are the Red Masks. They're hooligans... didn't you say so yourself? Boss. A bloody print was found on that garden lantern. Nice, send it to the lab. Don't temper with evidence. OK. Matsuda. Mr. Tojoji... We had a report from the Ministry of Welfare. the Ministry of Welfare? That's right. In elderly homes and orphanages around the country... donations were made in your name. Eh? What? Donations? In my name? Donations to orphanages? Hello. Eh? What? You're the Moon Mask Rider? What do you want? The money stolen yesterday night... will be returned to you. You're returning my money? Ah, thank you, I'm so grateful. However... I took a 20% commission... and donated it to Welfare institutions. 20%? That's too much. 20% is really a lot. You took 10% before, why 20% to me? I've been lending money and helping people for years... You've never taken 20%... That's too much, you can't rob me... The truth is... the money stolen last night... was all returned safely. And then, Mr. Tojoji... to show his gratefulness.. Donated 20% to institutions around the country. You did a good deed. It's nothing. I've been holding back my generosity long enough... this time it happened of its own. This is the least I can do. You did a good deed. - That's a moving story. - A moving story? A moving story? Who is he? Who is he? People call him the hero of love, the Moon Mask Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Anyone who wants to... can become him, Moon Masked Rider. The hero of love. It could be, that you are actually him. You could be him. It could be, that you are actually him. Moon Masked Rider, Moon Masked Rider. The hero of love. Oh Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Kuroki... what are you lamenting for? We need to do something now. We can't ignore anymore the Moon Rider. Who is the Moon Rider? Justice. Justice? That's ridiculous. It means nothing to the ideal of New Love Country. What is New Love Country's love to you? Kuroki, after all these years? Who were that bike gang? You sacrificed those bikers and Tommy. Where is your love? You fooled me. You sacrificed them so easily, is that love? Tommy was... Tommy wasn't killed by us. He was killed by the Moon Rider who's fighting our ideals. Don't try that speech on me. You and me pulled that trigger. We are his killers. Kuroki. Kill the Moon Rider. That's how we will go forth. I'll say it one last time. Call the young men from the island... and crush the Moon Masked Rider. I refuse. I'm not sacrificing our youth anymore. Is it true that the plan failed? Maybe it's the Moon Masked Rider again? Stop, don't mention him. But why did Kuroki forbid us to volunteer? He must be worried for us. OK. I'm going to Tokyo to meet the Master. I'm going with you. Boss. We got a hit on that fingerprint. What? His name is Kuroki Kome... he used to be an extremists student... and he participated in the Toto university Demonstrations. That guy who helped the Middle-Eastern... who was with an anarchist gang, that Kuroki? Yes. 5 years ago he participated in an action we couldn't arrest him. Kuroki left us. Love is courage. And he didn't have courage. You cannot lose sight of your enemy. We need to concentrate all our power now. That's right. We'll fight. Go forward. Let's crush our enemy. But without Kuroki? Stop that. I trust you, I trust your power. You need to act. - Master. - Master. Ogata, fight. Answer to the Master's call. Lead our youth. Yes, Master. Hurry. Mr. Obara. You won't move out with us? I have business to attend to. Then we'll go ahead. Megumi. What's your ideal? To be happy. In other words to create the New Love Country. New Love Country. New Love Country. New Love Country. We'll kill him... and all those who get in the way. It's that man. I thought I saw him somewhere, he's in your photos. Hey. Did something happen with this man? We have no evidence yet. He's one of the Red Masks. I'm going out. I trust you. Kuroki left us. The quitters deserve to die. Who is Kenpo Takebayashi really? At least our youth... You... could it be? You're under arrest. Take it off. Yes. - Come with us. - Alright. Kuroki. - You take care of him. - Alright. What's this? Damn. Where did they all go? Megumi. Hey, where are you going? Hey? Come on, let's go back. Hey. Kuroki, Ogata, Katagai... and Nakimura, they're all dead. Can't you see what's going on? Kuroki quit. And what about Ogata and Katagai? Those two were fighting for New Love Country. No. We were participated in Red Masks operations. Have you gone crazy? We're not connected to that gang of thieves. You don't know anything. What? - We all... - Megumi. Are you insulting the Master? The Master's ideals are pure. So you came back? Are you back with me, Makimura? I didn't want to. My comrades died. Tommy... Kuroki... and George. Don't involve our youth anymore. I didn't force anyone to follow me... those who believe in me, follow me. But we met a major obstacle. You mean the Moon Rider? Is he that much of a threat? The Moon Rider died... in front of your eyes. We cannot move ahead if we fear casualties. To create the New Love Country we need to move ahead. Without the New Love Country, there is no love. Sending our comrades to death... is that your 'love'? I can't move ahead like that. Makimura. There's no going back. Quitting is not an option. And if I wanted to? You'd kill me? Like you killed Kuroki? Ikuko. I'll go anywhere with you. To hell if need be. After the war ended... with great difficulty I finally returned to Japan. I had nothing left. Neither house, nor family. One full moon night... I heard the voice of a baby... you had been abandoned. I saw a young boy running down the hill. The young boy had lost his parents... he could afford to keep you, his little sister. Do you want to be left again. Do you understand? My New Love Country needs to be created for the most worthy person... Ikuko... for you, dear. You're a devil. I can't be defeated. Go steal 10 million dollars from the country. If you do that, I'll spare her. Alright. It's the Red Masks. Eh? The Red Masks? I want you to get 10 million dollars. What? 10 million dollars? If you don't... The young people will die. I'll call again. They want 10 million dollars in exchange for their lives? We know many young people are in New Love Country's hands. And since we don't know where they are... It's possible they're being held hostage. They're challenging the authority of the State. But... we'll have to concede for now. We have no choice. The youth's life comes first. Let's gather the 10 million dollars quickly. Matsuda... we need to make sure the young people are safe... and use this chance... to arrest the Red Masks. Yes, I will. Where do they want the exchange? There. Tonight, at midnight... 10 million dollars... Bring them at the Tokyo Baseball Stadium. Tokyo Baseball Stadium. Inspector Matsuda. Inspector Matsuda. Inspector Matsuda. Matsuda speaking. Enter through the main entrance. It's Suematsu, everyone go to the main entrance. Enter through the Journalist Club entrance. Journalist Club Entrance. Walk until the back screen. Going towards the back screen. Go to the sports field. Keep on walking that way. Keep on going. I want to make sure the young people are safe. I'm not giving the money before that. Right. If you want to save them, keep walking. I need a guarantee first. Who are you? Keep walking. Just follow my instructions. Stop. Drop the case... and go away. Don't be stupid. I'd give you 10 million without a guarantee? Give me a proof that they're safe. First you give the 10 million dollars. Put the case down. Inspector Matsuda. Why did you bring 10 million dollars? If you want to save the youth... you will drop that money and go. Aikawa, get the money. Damn it. Get the money. Careful. Grab the case. Grab it, grab it. Grab it. Grab the case. Run after it. Catch it, catch it. Look there. Damn. Our Home Land. Our Home Land. Our Home Land. Our ideal is... the Country of Love. The construction of the new Country of Love... that's all we wish. Our ideal country... without the realization of New Love Country... your pure soul radiating like the sun... will only be buried in death. In an absurd world. Love is strong. Be brave. Raise your glass high. Bring it to your mouth. Bring it to your lips. Bring it to your lips. Now, the unity of our love is being tested. The time draws near. New Love Country... New Love Country... New Love Country... Our... soul... It's poison. It's poison. It's poison. Poison... This is the true face of Takebayashi. He tried to poison you. If you want to live... open your eyes, set yourselves free. You need to leave... and show your courage. Now, go. And the young people? They're already gone to the New Love Country. already gone to the New Love Country? Yes, in exchange for their lives. In exchange for their lives? So what are these 10 millions for? The youth died happily for us. It had to be. But I can not die. Now, let's go. For the new love. You devil. Ikuko... I raised you like my own child. That's the purpose of the New Love Country. You are rejecting my loving hand. Are you unworthy of my love? Or... Die. Die, Moon Rider. Moon Rider. You think your justice will win? But my love will win. Which one is stronger, you think? Hey, hey, hey. OK, get up. Catch him, catch him. Bastards. Bastards. What do you want? I need to settle it with the Moon Rider. Thank you, Moon Rider. Who... Who are you? Boss. That man won't talk. We arrived too late. Boss. The young people are back to their families. But where did Takebayashi and the Red Masks go? Back to square one again, huh? We don't have anymore leads. Father. Father. Hey. You again. This is not a place for a cultural journalist. Stop teasing me. My photos helped you, didn't they? My editor​ heard it, I'm popular now. You think I'm interested in popularity... you're my son-in-law, you should know me better. Sorry. We had a report, a helicopter crashed in the sand quarry. They say the New Love Country founder... Takebayashi was in that crash. Hm? Father, what's that? When people will live in love and peace... the assistants of justice won't be needed anymore. Hoping for that day to come... I wish you good luck. Moon Masked Rider. To Inspector Matsuda. So he did it all again? So he outsmarted us again? Boss... who might be the Moon Masked Rider? He must be the messenger from the moon. That's scary... soon mankind will be living on the moon. I guess this case is closed then. Is he a good sign... or a bad sign? I wonder who the Moon Masked Rider is? Are you all Moon Rider fans? What is it about the Moon Rider? If he solves our cases and takes his commission... we don't need a police anymore. Whatever, let's quit the police... and find a real job. Right, Officer Yoshida? Right. Get back to it. Right. The Moon Masked Rider. Hey, wait, hey. Wait wait. My bike. Lieutenant wait. Lieutenant wait. Officer. Lieutenant wait. Who is he? Who is he? People call him the hero of love, Moon Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Anyone who wants to... can become him, Moon Masked Rider. The hero of love. It could be, that you are actually him. You could be him. It could be, that you are actually him. Moon Masked Rider, Moon Masked Rider. the hero of love. Oh Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider. Anyone who wants to... can become him, Moon Masked Rider. The hero of justice. It could be, that you are actually him. There's a hero in all of us. He could be you. Moon Masked Rider, Moon Masked Rider. The hero of love. One more time. Oh Masked Rider. Oh Masked Rider, Rider. No, no, no. Oh Masked Rider. The End
