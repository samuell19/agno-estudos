Christie Anderson. Thank you. Richard Areita. Thanks. Angel Washington. Melanie Fine. Thank you. Lawrence Blackly. Thank you. Kevin Morris. Beverly Putnic. Try not to lose them. It's a long walk to Yugoslavia. You guys, do you realize how lucky you are? You have the chance for 800 dollars to witness and ancient Balkan rite. Something that happens once every hundred years. - Miss Chase, the guy who's meeting us to take the ferry to... Ufir, what's his name? Professor Andromolek. Strong Slovak name. - Yeah, but how're we gonna recognize this guy? I mean, he's gonna have a red carnation on his head or his chest or what? - Don't worry, Angel, he'll find you. Mom, I told you to knock! Talk to me in English. I don't understand when you talk in Serbian. - Would you like me to help you finish packing? No, I can do it myself! - Remember to keep warm, it's cold in Yugoslavia. They don't have central heating like here, you know? You're American, for God sake, never forget your origin. Nothing to be ashamed of. Your father, he was Serbian too. God bless his soul. You'll have a wonderful time with your friends. Mother. They're not my friends. - Well, they will be if you only let them. You'll see. Beverly, I almost forgot. I came across this while I was throwing out some stuff of your father's. It comes from the same region your father was born. Ufir. That's where you're going. I love you, Mom. Where to? Glendale Boulevard in Burbank. Dobar dan. I am Professor Andromolek. Dobar dan is how you say "good morning" in Serbo-Croatian. Can you say, "dobar dan?" Dobar dan. This is very good. You are a nice group of junior ambassadors. But from the great United States of America, we expect only the best. If you do not hurry up, I will have to take back all the nice things I said about you. Come now! Come, come! Come, hurry up. I got it, man. Yes. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Beverly. Thanks. Ah, beautiful. Just like home. I get the top bunk. Just get in there. - The passion play you are about to see dates back two thousand years. Two thousand years may seem like a long time to you who are from a country which was founded only 200 years ago. However, in the scope of the passage of time, two thousand years is but a sneeze. Excuse me, Professor, how can a passion play predate Christianity when by definition it's a reenactment of the Passion of Christ? That, Mr. Blackly, is a good question and point. The passion play is anomalous. Its central character is a female, specifically a virgin female. Perhaps this is why every year thousands of pilgrims arrive from everywhere. And, of course, scholars like yourselves. So, before I forget, here there is one for each of you. Little things which will distinguish us. Oh, wow. - It is a nice little souvenir, yes? They're beautiful. Looks just like Beverly's... - It is the sign of the pagan virgin. - There's only one virgin I know of. You are rude. Hello. Am I disturbing you? You are such a shy, innocent and lovely young girl. I want to be your friend. I must talk to you. I'm worried. You don't seem to have so much in common with your traveling companions. Are you lonely? You are so very brave. I've seen these things before. Young people can be so very cruel. It's really not their fault. It's me. Yeah. Maybe I can help you. Come. Come. Good morning! How are you? Just fine. Good. Well, everything is ready for the ceremony Professor. Where the hell are we? - I don't know, sure ain't my pad back in East LA. - This place is a dump! - It's interesting, I guess. Where are we going? - Just past McDonalds and left at Disneyland. It will take place in the cave. And tonight? The kids will stay in the village houses. Very good. Vesna prepared a wonderful soup for all of them. They will be fine. Just fine. So, this is Ufir. And now you will step back in time. My friends will take you to where you stay and tomorrow morning I will see you again. Beverly, come with me. Come. This is here you will stay and this is Vesna. I am very cold. I must have some hot soup. Is very nice with hot soup. Would you like some hot soup, Beverly? No, thank you. - I think you will like some hot soup. Some soup, please. Thank you. It will give you energy. Mmmmm. Very good, Vesna. Very good. This is good soup, Beverly. Come. You drink. Come. It will give you energy too. Thank you. So... Beverly. Virgin... She's a virgin... Christie! Richard! Richard, wake up! There's a fire! Come on, wake up! Get up, what're you doing?! Come on, get out of bed, come on! We gotta get out of here! Hurry, we've gotta find Beverly! - Richard, there's a fire, come on, man! Wake up! Come on, what're you doing, there's a fire! Come on! Don't just lay there, come on! No. No! Oh no! Richard! Beverly! Oh God, Larry. Are you okay? I think so. Come on, we gotta go! Where's Richard? There was a fire. - Wait a minute! - Fire? What happened to Richard? He didn't make it. What? Hey, let's get the fuck out of here! We can't just leave him here! He's dead! All right?! He's dead, goddamn it! We gotta go, come on, let's go! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! - Melanie! - Come on! Come on, you can do it, come on! Give me your hand! Come on, give me your hand! A little more! Come on, give me your hand, a little bit faster! - Come on! - Come on! - You can get up, come on! Ah! We can't just leave her there! Larry! Are you all right? No. - Come on, we gotta get ahead of them. Come on. - Ow! Kevin, come on! Come on, we'll help you, come on! Hurry up, damn it, I'll help you! What're we gonna do? Go stop the train. Oh shit. We need some help. Can you tell us where the train is going? When does the train stop? Can anybody help us? - Hey, mister, when's the next stop? I don't understand. I can't help you. Does anybody speak English? Hey! Hey, check this out. What's happening? What's happening here? Do we have some young criminals on board? I haven't seen your tickets. Show me your documents! Look, we're in trouble. Do you speak English? Do you understand? Please. I really need to get to a phone. You gotta stop the train. We've got friends back there. Somebody got killed. We need the police. Just a minute. Excuse me, sir... ...but we really do need your help. What's your problem? Okay. Okay, don't worry. I little English, do understand. But I never have practice to speak. Come, come. Come, Bosco will do. Please, come. - These people really know how to travel in style, huh? No, not people. Only rich, like kings, barons and counts. Never people. Please, help to it, be at home. Marius. Marius, he ride with me. Keep Bosco company. Very good company. He no speak. Never speak. Maybe hear, maybe not. Maybe no tongue. Best company in the world. He tell no lies. Now let us hear your story. - Listen, two of your friends are still back in Ufir. Can you do something? Do something? Oh yeah, take you to police for next stop. That's what I do. Tell them, they do something. Bosco can do nothing. Do you have a radio? A radio? A radio, no. - Hey, hey, hey, just tell us the next stop. Next stop. 10 hours and 42 minutes. Not so fast as capitalists time. - Man, we gotta do something to get out of here. I think it's broken. Oh, Jesus. We gotta make a splint. How? Get some wood. Get down! Mitre! Look at this! Are you crazy? Going down there like this? Let's move out of here! I see something on the tracks. Mitre! Help! Mitre! Help! Mitre! Help! Mitre! Help! Mitre! Mitre! Help! Mitre! Mitre! Help me with the door. They're disconnecting the train. Help! Try the windows! What happened? The conductor died. I can't get it. - The break's not working! - I can't get the window down! Let's pull together. Pull, pull, pull! I can't! Try the other one! No. Try this one, come on. No, it won't open! - Beverly, you must come with me! Everything was decided many years ago, before you were born. Before your mother or your mother's mother was born. I want you to go with me now, Beverly. In a sacred ceremony. What ceremony? The passion play. Your coronation as the Princess of Darkness. I don't understand. - Of course you don't. Think about your mark, Beverly. Your sacred mark. You mean my birthmark? - Yes, the Prince marked you so that no one else would have you first. Who marked me? - My master, Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness. I don't believe you. It isn't true! I can prove it, through your friends, Beverly, if I must. - What do they have to do with it? Nothing. They are expendable. Please, leave them alone. - They have to die now, Beverly. No! - They have treated you so poorly. No! Oh, dear Beverly, if only you knew what was waiting you as his bride. Go with me, now, go with me, Beverly. I'd die before I go with you! You will not die. I will! - But you see, child, you cannot die. I don't believe any of this! I'm going crazy. - Do you think this is a dream? - I'm losing my mind, this is just a dream. Beverly, this is not a dream. No, it's not, it's me! I know it's me, I'm going crazy! You'll have to prove to me otherwise. Beverly, I'm your mom. Mama! Where's Beverly? - I don't know, I haven't seen her since last night. - Knowing her, she probably locked herself in the head. She probably drowned. Ugh. Are you okay? There's something up ahead. We're coming to a town. Help! Help! Help! Stop the train! Help! Hello? This time Thomas has gone too far! He didn't stop at my station, and he lost half of his train! Hold on, sir. I'll get you the stationmaster. Sir. You're wanted on the phone. There's something wrong with the ten seventeen train. All right, just a minute. What's happening? What's all this about the ten seventeen train? It didn't stop at my station! Not only that, half of it is missing! I've got my station full of passengers waiting to board. They want to know what's going to happen to them. Leave it to me. Keep me posted. Wait, I hear it coming. I don't understand. It must be a runaway train. The engineer might be sick. I don't know yet. But we must stop that train. Hey, anybody in here? Beverly, are you in here? Who are you? - It's not your business. You speak English. She speaks English. Don't mess with Sava. Look, maybe you can help us. We're looking for a friend of ours. An American girl, blonde hair- What'd you do with her?! Where is she? Sava's a thief, not a killer! Control 1 to Control 2. Check your position on track 48 near Ufir. Get me Shardonofski on the phone. I want all traffic personnel on duty until this is cleared up. Listen, guys, your friends is up there in the engine. I don't wanna go up there. - You wanna help her, you have to go in there. I'm gonna go check is out. Go! Go, come on, let's go! Beverly! Beverly! Beverly, are you in here?! There's no one driving the damn train! Beverly, you all right? You guys, she's in here! Come here, come help me get her out. Get up. Get her hand. - Come on, get up, get up! Get her hand, I got her. Are you okay? I'm fine. - Hey, what do you think you're doing?! Hey, what're you doing?! I wanna stop the train! That's what you wanted, right? - That won't stop the engine, you fool! Well do it yourself! I can't do it anyway. We didn't mean to offend you. Just, we need to go over there. - Hey, you have any idea how to stop this train? - I'm gonna go try and stop the engine. No! You can't go in there, it's dangerous! I've gotta try something. You can't go in there. Unbelievable... The train has disappeared. It looks like it jumped the tracks. Check if the monitor is working. Okay. Control 1 to Control 2. Check the main monitor. Are you all right? Hey, I think there's a house over there. Come on. It's just a little way. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. There's nobody here. - Where did the smoke come from then? Larry. You keeping something from us? What's with you? - What're you talking about, Angel? - You were up at that engine a long time. Come on, Putnic. I mean, you are hiding something. What's with you? I mean, what's gotten you so freaked out? - Anybody want to give me a hand? Leave me alone. You're not my friends. You never cared about me. You don't understand anything. You always thought I was just a stupid, ugly little kid. - Hey, guys, I think out little Bevy has finally slipped off her mark. I think I understand. You got this frightened little girl who wants to get laid, right? And you got this big horny engineer all alone in a hot locomotive. So the big guy pops her cherry and no more baby Beverly. She's a hot woman now. She's feeling guilty as sin. The first fuck of her life so she kills the guys who fucked her. - You know, you really fucking blew it back there. Telling her that she killed those guys? She couldn't hurt a fly. I know. I feel really bad. I kinda flipped out for a second. Kevin? What? What? Do you love me? Yes. - What is it you like about me? I don't know. Your hair, your mouth, your eyes, everything. - Do you think I'm pretty? Yes. Come here. I want you by me. How're you doing? Great. Time to party. - Glad that you're feeling better. I'm not. Just a little gallows humor. - So what're you doing on this damn train? I work on train. You work for the railroad? I work for Sava. People can forget things in train. Watches, purses, suitcases. And also, once a week the train goes to Skopje. Immigrants send money there back to their family. Nobody sends money to Sava, so she had to take care of herself. - You haven't been busted yet, huh? Sava smart. She knows what she's doing. I only take 10 percent from each envelope. - Hey, listen, do you think this will work? It is possibility. But we are against powerful evil here. - I don't believe in that crap. Is your problem. - You don't think it was just all a bunch of accidents? - Fireman, engineer, conductor all dead. No accident. - I mean, you try and pull this gypsy double talk on me. - I wish it was true what you say. Something is terrible here. I want you so bad. Please, will you love me? Kiss me. Look! It's coming back! Call Modenovoc. And tell them to take emergency measures. I want visual reports. Understood? Melanie, hold it! Hold it! Hear that? We're getting closer. You hear that? We're getting closer. There it is again. But in the opposite direction. Another train is heading towards it on the same track... They'll crash! Shunt the Slavitcha train on to an alternate track. It can't be done. Repairs. There's no alternate track in this area. They're on a collision course. At that speed, they'll crash in... 1 hour and 10 minutes. I killed Melanie and Larry. I killed Christie and Richard. I'm destined to kill all of you. I didn't know. I've been the instrument of the devil. I won't be anymore. I don't want anyone else to die because of me. Oh God, help me! Get something, get some sheets! Give me the bomb. Come on. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Don't let me die! Help! Help! No! Kevin! Oh, God! Kevin! We are now... 17 minutes from impact. Prepare to.. Derail. The train is coming! Get out of the way! Hello?! You must stop that train! Do anything! What? Trucks? Okay. All the trucks you can get. But, hurry up! Come on you guys! What are you waiting for? Come on! Hurry up! Angel! Angel, what're you doing?! Beverly! Beverly! Watch out, get inside! Angel! Incredible. It's on the tracks again. What's happening here? You have to do something! Let go, Beverly, get off! Welcome. What happens now? - He will not be gentle, Beverly. That is not his way. But your new life will be fantastic. I am happy for you to be with the Master, always forever. This is wonderful. Tell me, are you happy? I can hardly wait. Afterwards, I can have everything I want. - Yes, you will sit to the right of the Master and every passion, everything that before has been forbidden for mankind, everything will be yours forever. - Things won't be so different then. I thought afterwards, everything would change. - It will, Beverly, for the better. Passion, greed and envy will run rampant in the world? Yes. Oh, that pleases you. My dearest Beverly, I am so proud I picked you and my Master will be so pleased. - I wouldn't have missed this for anything. And will I see you again afterwards? Afterwards, you are his. No! No! No! Miss Putnic? Yes? - You must make new passport. Why? - This picture is not acceptable. When was it shot? Three months ago? You look so different. Come back to our country. Thank you. Miss Putnic! Wait, wait. I'm glad I caught you. A gentleman left this on the desk for you. He said that you lost it. Who left it? Is he still here? - Yes. There he is. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are experiencing a bit of turbulence. We request that you remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened and please refrain from smoking, thank you. Miss? Are you all right? Miss? Are you all right? You must've had a nightmare. Can I get you something? I ju... I wanna go home.
