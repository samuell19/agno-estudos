[MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNS FIRING] [SPEAKING FORIEGN LANGUAGE] [GUNS FIRING] Mr. Jim? Mr. Jim? -Gun. Gun. -Gun. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CARS HONKING] -How many hurt? -Four. We'll take them back -Get them to the infirmary. I'll call the doctor and Captain Madel. -Get ready to contact Zampo. No. Help. Infirmary, Tatoy. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Message. Commanding officer, constabulary headquarters. Full raid discloses large shipment. Arms, ammunitions, my district. Origin of weapons reveals-- what's the matter? -We're getting interference. -Well, can you fix it? It's important. -Maybe it's the [INAUDIBLE]. I'll check it. -Beautiful. Christmas present? -Get out. -I just got here. -Get out. -(SHOUTING) Idiot! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Jojo, get her at full speed up river fast. Get ready to jump. -Pull up close to "The King." -Try to look busy. Move about. -If they ever find out that we have two boats that look like, we'll be in a lot of trouble. -Yes sir, captain. -Cheer up. We'll make it. -Looks like we have company. Play dumb. Well, hello lieutenant. Out for an evening joy ride? -I guess you know why we're here. -Yes, yes, of course. Be my guest. -Search the boat. -Nothing but sea shells, lieutenant. Show them around, Jojo. -Yes sir, captain. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -You see, lieutenant, just like I said, nothing but sea shells. Excellent business. Buttons, you know. Why, do you realize how many people in this world would be stranded without buttons, lieutenant. You know, I take my word as a sacred trust. Like I always say, those buttons must go through. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -I suppose you think you're quite clever. One of these days, I'm going to catch you with a load of untaxed cigarettes. Or perfume, or maybe something worse. And that will be the end of it. Your smuggling days will have come to abrupt end. -Ah, I'm sorry I couldn't accommodate you, lieutenant. I could send you a set of buttons. You're welcome back anytime, lieutenant. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[INAUDIBLE], daddy. -How you doin', tall boy? -(SHOUTING) Break it up here! Knock it off! -[INAUDIBLE] -That one? All right, all right, all right. Knock it off here. Knock it off. Knock it off. Get out. Get out. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SHOUTING) Johnny! Lover! -Hey, Tiki. Take it easy. -Where've you been? I thought you were proud of me. -Just a little business. -Come on, baby. Buy me a drink. -You guys get out, sober up. -Double scotch on the rocks. What will you have, honey? -Same. Make it strong. -Double scotch on the rocks. Here's your 20, Teresa. Next time, collect first. -OK, Johnny, tell me. You got another girl, huh? How come I don't see you for so long? -Business. Big business, honey. Yeah. -But this time you stay home, hm? -For a while. -Your paying, daddy. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Jack. This is for the boys. The drinks and the girls. Got it? If they use up that much, kick them out, OK? -Right. -Oh, Johnny, now I know I missed you so much. -Yeah, now I know, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. Dirkson? -Yeah, what can I do for you? -I represent Mr. Belltower. My name is Jorgens. -That's nice. Have a drink. -I don't think you understand. -Sure, I do. Hey, get him, girl. -I'm here to deliver a message. Mr. Belltower is the gentleman who inquired about you through a mutual friend. -That's nice -Mr. Belltower wishes to see you soon. Tonight. That's fine. -Can't you see, friend, I have a prior engagement. -But Mr. Dirkson-- -Besides, you know, I don't cotton messenger boys. This guy wants to see me, tell him to come and see me himself. -He's outside in a car now. If you would just step out for a moment. -Hey, what's wrong with right here? -Mr. Belltower says to tell you it's important. He mentioned El Dorado. You'd understand. I'll see you later, honey. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi, boss. -Hi, Jojo. -Hey, Teresa. Hey. Am big tonight? -Yes, I'm big tonight? -Well, Mr. Dirkson, this is a pleasure. You're that rare breed-- the rugged individualist. Since all my attempts to entice you to come to me have failed, like Muhammad, I have come to the mountain. -OK, here I am. What can I do for you? -Right to the point, eh? -That's it. Man mentioned something about El Dorado. -Yes, that's part of it. -Oh? -Well, let's not rush it, shall we, Mr. Dirkson? As a matter of fact, I wanted to invite you to a little party tonight. -Sorry, I'm tied up tonight. -You won't regret it, Mr. Dirkon. Or are you so indifferent to your own best interest? I have something that I think you'll want very much. A million dollars, Mr. Dirkson? -Million? -Shall I send my car to pick you up at your hotel in, say, about an hour? -I'd say in about an hour. -Happy birthday, darling. -Daddy, they're beautiful. Thank you. Mr. Dirkson must be quite a remarkable man. He certainly has you all in a tissy. -Marjorie, my little vampire. Dirkson is not one of your momentary toy soldiers to be wound up and then thrown away again. -Don't worry, I'm just fascinated. He and I've got some business to discuss, so I don't want you tampering with the success of that outcome. -Why all this fuss about one little plantation on some god-forsaken part of the world? -It isn't one little plantation. It's a complex of diversified products. Copra, coffee, ruda. It covers a large, island. And that god-forsaken part of the world, as you call it, is in the heart of lush, rich Southeast Asia. Turbulent and violent, but still an empire of raw materials. And I am going to be part of that empire. Dirkson is going to help me in that noble endeavor. -Sounds very exciting. -Tis, my pet. Ah, here he is. You'll excuse me a minute. Mr. Dirkson. I am glad you came. -Why? Did you think I wouldn't? -I wasn't quite sure. Um, what'll you have? -Just who are you, Belltower? What is your game? -(LAUGHING) An interesting question. -Financier. Adventurer. -Gambler. And I put all my stakes on Southeast Asia. Your father was like that, wasn't he? Oh, don't be surprised. I know all about him. Sit down. Henry Dirkson. Corporal United States Army. Discharged Manilla, 1916. 1917, 1918-- whereabouts unknown. 1919, he suddenly and rather dramatically shows up at the court of the sultan Muhammad Khan. What's more, he's a favor to the old man. In return, this brash Yankee soldier is made a gift-- a whole lush, big island close to Borneo, as yet untouched and unclaimed by any colonial power. How unusual it is to own a piece of land that no government or nation has any claim to. El Dorado fascinates me. I need it. I want it. -You've got the wrong, Belltower. You want to talk to my brother. -I've already approached your brother with a very generous offer. He said the decision was entirely yours. -$1 million. 20 million coconuts. You must have a real love for coconuts, Belltower. -(LAUGHING) Yes, I love coconuts. And Freedom, Mr. Dirkson. I'm fascinated with the prospect of being my own law, unaccountable to any man or nation. -Mmhmm. You know, That's. Just what I thought. You know, my brother probably thinks that if it's worth all that money to you, it would be worth a lot more to someone else. -Well, of course, he's right. But I venture to say that the future of your island is somewhat precarious. And I'm sure you'll admit that there are a great many countries that would be delighted to annex El Dorado. Well, I suppose they'd have much quibble about taking it by force. -What about you? What would make it so much easier for you to hold off such a force? -Two things. I have enormous ambition, and a lot of money. That's said, it's a risk that I can afford to take. Now can I count on your seeing your brother? -I'll talk to him. -Good. Let's join the party, shall we? -Let's get one thing straight. The Decision is strictly his. -Oh, uh, by the way. Are you taking your boat south? -Possibly. Why? -Well, I have a number of surplus track engines that I want to sell to a man in Indonesia. I'd like him to get them as soon as possible. -Well, I've got a couple boats going down the first thing in the morning. We won't be going down quite as far as Indonesia, though. -No problem. I'll arrange for him to pick them up in El Dorado-- if you've no objection. -No. No, that's OK. -Good. -Oh, Mr. Dirkson, I'd like you to meet one of my associates. Uh, Your Highness. -Ah, Mr. Belltower. -My apologies. Allow me to present Mr. Dirkson. We've been in conference. Mr. Dirkson, this is a business associate of mine, His Highness Prince Ali Hakim. -Charmed, Mr. Dirkson. I assume you are related to the esteemed family of El Dorado? -Mr. Dirkson is the brother of James Dirkson. -How interesting. Certainly, I hope you are more sensible than your brother. -What does that mean? Simply that destiny is destiny, my dear fellow. -There are the sheep of this world, and the wolves also. Those who wait to see what happens, and those that make it happen. We intend to make things happen. Your charming island is important to us. But your brother is a stubborn man. -Oh, come now, Your Highness. We can't discuss this some other time? -No, let him go on. I'd like to hear what's in store for me. -It's very simple. Sooner or later, El Dorado will be ours. -Now there is a simple and profitable way of doing things, or a more dramatic and explosive way. We have handled long enough with your brother, and our patience is running out. -You know something, Belltower? Your fat friend just said the wrong thing. Now I can't say whether or not my brother will sell, but I'll tell you this-- the price just went up. Exactly double. -Now Mr. Dirkson. -I wouldn't say any more if I were you. You know, this could be a very expensive conversation. -Mr. Dirkson is quite right. Your Highness, I think you said enough. -Hello, everyone. -Ah, Marjorie. Mr. Dirkson, allow me to present my daughter, Marjorie. Mr. Dirkson, I'm very jealous. I was under the impression this party was given in my honor, but it seems our guests are gravitating toward you. -I'm sorry, Ms. Belltower. If I-- -Marjorie. And you should be sorry. -(LAUGHING) You're quite right, Marjorie. Now while you exact tribute from Mr. Dirkson, I remember that I have some business to attend to. Why don't you come with me, Your Highness. Excuse us, won't you. -You know we have a beautiful garden. -I'd like to see it. -Do you usually come to the rescue? -Hm, not usually. I'm a [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh. Was there one? -Mmhmm. It seemed an easy way to meet you. I must say, Mr. Dirkson, the way you look at me, I'm not sure which one of us is more fascinated by the other. -Well, you'll have to forgive me because I'm used to sort of sizing up a man or a woman up at a glance. -And how do you size me? -Oh, all woman. -Nothing more? -Does there have to be anything more? You're beautiful, rich. I think you've got too much as it is. -Oh, sir. I was hoping daddy would give you to me for Christmas. John Dirkson, tell me about yourself. -Why, hasn't your father told you? -No, not exactly. Oh, I don't mean the simple cut and dry facts. I know about your family and the island, and I know that you're strange, but fascinating. -Oh, did you tell you all that? -No. I see it, and I feel it. I feel that you're different from other men. -Maybe. I better warn you, I'm just passing through. I came from nowhere. I'm headed for the same place. I play for keeps only for now. Tomorrow morning, I could forget all about it. -You play my game. What are you waiting for? -I'd like to find out everything about you. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Mr. Dirkson? -Operator, I'd like to send a straight wire to Kamboanga. -Hey, Jojo. Hey. C'mon, on your feet. Hey. Jojo. Hurry. -Come on. On your feet. Wake up. -OK, skipper. Already in ship shape. -There will be a couple truckloads of crate. Put them on the Kopete. Fill up the fuel tanks and get under way. I want you to try to be out of here by noon. -Where to? -El Dorado. -El Dorado? Hey! No kidding? -That's right. -I guess Mr. Jim should be glad to see us again. -I'm afraid not, Jojo. He's dead. I'm going ahead by plane. I don't want you wasting any time on the way. I'll see you there in about three days. -Or maybe sooner. -OK. Good luck. -Mr. Dirkson? Don't you remember Pepi? -Pepi? Oh. Yeah, Pepi. You've gained a little weight. -I got married, and my wife is a wonderful cook. -And I am, uh, Captain Model, Philippine constabulary. -Glad to know you, captain. Oh, you were the one who sent the wire, weren't you? -Yes. Oh, I've got a jeep here. Do you have any baggage, Mr. Dirkson? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Just how did this happen? -The last one two years. Many times but it's failed. We fight them off. Then the other day, it's the same. We catch a bunch of pirates who come with guns and ammunitions. When we get back to the compound, Jim runs into shack to wire Captain Model. But something was wrong with the radio, so the operator steps outside to fix it. When he comes back, he sees your brother dead. -Did you get the guys who did it? -We tried. -Tried? How about you, Captain? You're supposed to be the law around here. -In the Philippines, yes. But you forget, technically, your family's island is not part of the Philippines. We can assist unofficially. And of course, we are sympathetic. -Sympathetic. That didn't help my brother much, did it, your sympathy? -Believe me, Mr. Dirkson, we are just as concerned as you are about this whole business. In recent years, some international adventures have been stirring up trouble all over Southeast Asia. Terrorisms, bombings, many times under the guise of revolution, and frequently involving communists. They even use some of our own people to gain their own ends. We'd like to know what those ends might be, and I think you can help us. -Look, Captain, let's get this straight. I came down here because of my brother's death. Now if I could help get the guys who did it, fine. But as far as politics is concerned, that's strictly out of my line. -Sorry. I think I'll drop by El Dorado in a couple of days, if you don't mind. -No, I don't mind. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm glad your back Mr. Dirkson. With your brother gone, you will still run the plantation now? -Pepi, the plantation was never for me. Now that Jim's gone, I'm afraid I won't stick around too long. -El Dorado, it's yours, just like it was your father's. You just can't leave that. -Mr. Dirkson has just arrived. Let him collect his thoughts. -I'm sorry. -I understand, Pepi. -Your boat is loading supplies now. Will leave in the morning. I'll arrange a room for you. Excuse me. -Hey, you're back. You're back. You're back. -Hey, hold on, young lady. -You're back. -I think-- I think you've got me mistaken for someone else. -Don't you remember me? -Well, it's not that I don't remember, it's that I'm not exactly sure. -Maria. -Maria? -Maria Vargas. -Maria? Maria Vargas? Vargas. Why, sure I rem-- the Vargas family. MARIA: Yeah. -Well, I'll be. Why, of course I remember. But I remember two small boys and a skinny little girl in pigtails. -I am the girl. -Yeah, I can see that, all right. How in the heck did you grow up so fast? -Then you remember. -Well, of course I remember, but not quite like this. What are you doing here? -I brought some medical supplies for the infirmary. -Medical supplies? -Mmhmm. I'm the nurse of El Dorado. -Oh, is that right? -Yes. I will go there tomorrow. Mr. Jim arranged that I should go to the island every two wees to work at the infirmary. Always, I brought something-- cookies, cakes. And many times, we talked about you and when you would return. Now you are back. I can only bring him flowers. He can no longer here me. -Yeah, we'll both miss him, Maria. Well, I guess I'll get on back to the hotel. -Hotel? No, you must stay at my house. Hotel. -Maria, I'll come out first thing in the morning. See ya then. -No, we always expect you to stay with us. Besides, Juan and Pepi would be happy to see you again. -Look, I still think it's going to be too much trouble, Maria. -No more talking. We go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Which is which? -The three in front, Tatoy and Juan. -Tatoy? -And this other boy, I sort of adopted him after his mother died. She was a very close friend of mine. His father was from Brooklyn. He can't talk, and I'm trying to teach him how. -Hello, Pepi. How are ya? Hello Juan. Hello Tatoy. -He's very shy to strangers. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This is our ducks. [DUCKS QUACKING] -Come into our house? -Yes. -Tio, you want to play with the ducks? -They're so proud of them. -Come on. -We have many, many ducks. Looks like you have thousands. -No, no, but many. Thanks Mr. Dirkson for the help. [DUCKS QUACKING] [BOY MAKING QUACKING NOISE] -Boys, feeding time. [BOYS MAKING QUACKING NOISE] -Quack, quack? It's all about Tatoy. They just love to watch him imitate the ducks. [BOYS MAKING QUACKING NOISE] -(SINGING) Quack, quack. Quack, quack. Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack. Everywhere I quack, quack [INAUDIBLE] So I went out to see what was going on. They kept a little [INAUDIBLE] in the middle of the flock. And the duck did a dance I never saw before. He did the right-foot waddle, quack, quack. The right-foot waddle, quack, quack. He waddled to the left and waddled to the right, flapping his wings and quacking all night. [INAUDIBLE] tail feather, everybody get together. Quack, quack. Quack, quack. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ah, you like fish? Real big fish here. I see you if you like. Any kind of fish. Big one, small one, any kind of fish. You like? I been fisherman here for many, many years. We have many fish here. Any kind of fish. Big ones, small ones. Any kind of fish. Hey, you, c'mon, buy fish. I see the big one. -Tio? MARIA: Tio? -What happened? -Think I just bought some fish. -Thanks. Thanks for the lift. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -There are many troubles in the sea. We never know which one are the pirates. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Who do you suppose they are? -Well, they look like fishermen. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, [INAUDIBLE], El Dorado. I have a jeep waiting for us. -Yeah. [FOG HORN BLOWING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Pepi? -Yes sir? -Whose airplane? -I don't know, sir. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -He says they came earlier. Three of them. They claim to be friends of yours. -Friends of mine? -Yeah, and one was a girl with the hair the color of this silver and gold. [LAUGHING] [CAR HORN HONKING] -[SPEAKING BROKEN LANGUAGE] No. Goat. Follow. Follow the jeep. MR. BELLTOWER: Ah, Mr. Dirkson. I must apologize for dropping in unannounced like this. -I must admit, it is quite a surprise. -You can blame me. I made him detour so we could drop by and see you. -I hope this isn't, uh, an inconvenience. -No, it's all right. -Maria. Ms. Vargas? Belltower and his daughter, Marjorie. -Ms. Vargas. -How do you do? Hello. -Delighted. Maria? -Yes. -Shall we? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Ms. Vargas, His Highness, Prince Ali Hakim. -Charmed. -Senor Juan. Welcome home. -Juriah, it's sure good to see you. -Tio, would you excuse me? I have something to take care of. -I still can't understand why a man like you would be leave all this for a less secure life. -You said that before. -A pleasant enough house. But of course, I'd make a few changes here and there. But altogether, I bless it. -Juriah will take care of any of your needs. -Your Highness, for the last time, watch your tongue. I can't have my plans ruined by your blundering remarks. -May I fix you gentlemen a drink? I think I'll have one. Or two. Or three. -All present and accounted for. The Dirksons-- mother, father, and sons. All but one underground. -Tio, you must not be bitter. It was their home. Your home. -Home? This damned island just killed my mother and father, and now my brother. Well, it's not going to kill me, I tell you that. -What will you do? I don't know, Maria. I'll just have to think things out. -Your brother loved you so much. Like your mother and father, you must-- well, I'll go and check the infirmary now. -I'll see you at dinner. -Stand guard near the generator. Double the guard at the gate. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] --[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Welcome to, my brother. -What are you doing here? -Why, I'm here to welcome El Dorado's lord and master, like a brother. -Half-brother. -I have the feeling you are not glad to see me. -You're right, I'm not glad to see you. My father tolerated you, but I don't intend to. I don't trust you, Ahmed, and I don't like you. -What a pity. Your departed brother and I became quite close. -In a pig's eye, I'll bet. -Why do you dislike me so? I am everybody's friend. -Yeah, you said it. I remember when the Japs were crawling all over these islands, You. Were their friend, too. OK, so the war is ancient history, but on this island, you are out of bounds. -I should say [INAUDIBLE] I regret if I will have offended you. A thousand pardons. -Who was that strange fella? -A local character. Used to cause some trouble around here. -Oh, there you are. I thought you deserted me. I hope you're all finished with your business, because I think it's high time we all had a nice, tall, cold drink. -How long have you been here as a nurse? -Almost three years. -Such a beautiful nurse. I hope you stay with us when we take over. -Ms. Vargas, I was hoping we would have the pleasure of seeing you again. -Hello. -Everything all right at the infirmary? -Yes, uncle. We have a compete supply. -Good. -Uncle? I didn't know you two were related. -Well, not exactly. We're just old friends. -How nice. We're old friends, too, aren't we, darling? -What do you have to drink? -Orange, please. -Good idea. With gin or vodka? No, just orange. -I'll have some orange, too. -Gin, darling? [GUNSHOT] -Get back to the house quick. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -What was that, Mr. Dirkson? Some kind of a prank? -No, just a little target practice with your cocktails. Are you still crazy enough to want the place? -I know what you mean, but I'm a man of my word. The offer still stands. -You better get in the house. -Are you all right, dear? -You better get inside. I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid you're going to have to stay in the house. We may have trouble tonight. -Uncle John, I think we should call a nurse for your niece. But then again, she is the nurse, isn't she? -I'll get the infirmary. -OK. -Anyone hurt? -No, but you get that man, and make it fast. -We will try. -Try? Try won't be good enough. Get him. Do you hear me? -Yes sir. PEPI: Mr. Dirkson? I suggest you wear this. It's a good idea. C'mon. [BOY MAKING NOISES] -How'd that boy lose his voice? When he was nine years old, the pirates burned the house. His mothers and fathers and four brothers and sisters were burned alive. The doctor says it was that. -Mr. Dirkson? -I got him, Mr. Dirkson. -Are you sure it's the same one? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -They track him for two hours. He come down tree. They saw him. -I understand the language, Pepi. -Why did you bring him here if he was dead? -Mr. Dirkson said bring him back no matter what. -OK, OK. You men did fine. Just get rid of him. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -They caught him. When I see that hot-headed fool Ahmed, I'll give him a piece of my mind. -Ahmed is one of my best men. It was just an error, I'm sure. -Error? If Dirkson is killed, it'll be his last tether? I must keep Dirkson alive to negotiate. -Oh, your orders have been given, and they will be followed. [WOMAN SINGING] -Oo, I'm a white tornado. -What is it? -I'll take care of it. Keep your men at their stations. -Hi. -I told everyone specifically to stay in the house. -I'm taking a bath. I always take a bath before I go to sleep. I like to be clean. -All right, come on out. -Come on in, uncle. Feel. The water's great. -Ms. Belltower, that'll be quite enough. -But I haven't scrubbed my back yet. Why don't you come in and scrub my back? -Very funny. C'mon, now give me your hand. Give me your hand. [LAUGHING] -Look, Marjorie, this is no joke. All hell is liable to break loose here any minute. Come on out. -My goodness, uncle tio. You're so proper. -Come on, get out. -All right, c'mon. Move. -Well, thanks a lot, Sir Galahad. Don't I get to ride? -All right, get in the house. [YELPING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Inside. -You didn't exactly finish the job. -Oh, what job? -Tucking me -There will be no tucking tonight, Cleopatra. Inside. -All right, look. Book. -Book. -Book. -Now you can write "book." [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [PLAYING PIANO] [SINGING] [PLAYING PIANO AND SINGING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNSHOTS] -What's happening out there? -I don't know. It's probably one of their crazy feuds. Keep away from the windows. Why don't you go to bed? -Where's Johnny? -You've had quite enough of that. Marjorie, go to bed. [GUNSHOTS] [SHOUTING] -What-- what are you doing in here? -G-g-grenade. Grenade. -You better get over to the infirmary. -Yes. Yes. [GUNSHOTS] [SHOUTING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] -That sounds like it's from the infirmary. [WOMAN SCREAMING] -Get them retreating. [WINDOW BREAKING] -Maria? [GUNSHOTS] [WOMAN SOBBING] -I think Mr. Dirkson will be at his turning point soon. If he has a sufficiently uncomfortable night, he will be quite willing to sell by morning. [GUNSHOTS] [MAKING A BIRD CALL] -That's Ahmed's signal. I will go see what he wants. -No. I will see what he wants. [GUNSHOTS] [MAKING A BIRD CALL] [WHISTLING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -You must be more careful. That stupid fool who fired at us was brought in. -That stupid fool was dead, sir. -Yes, I see. Excellent. Well, from the sound of it, you have accomplished a great deal. -The price was high, if any. We've lost many men. Never mind. We'll beat Dirkson to his knees until he whimpers. -Not without more guns and ammunition. And the payment of the second installment is overdue. -You are without ammunition? -Almost. -Ammunition will be arriving tomorrow. I'll see that you get it. Now go, and withdraw your men as so you had ammunition. -Oh, yes, yes. The money. The payment-- -That has nothing to do with me. Prince Ali Hakim will take care of that. Now go. [GUNSHOTS] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -John? Are you all right? -Yes. I'm all right. -My god, what's happening? All that shooting. -Just what do you think happened? -Marjorie. -This is a disgrace. Don't these bandits know that a person who is of my station is here? -Well, I guess not, Your Highness. But you don't have to worry about it, because you'll all have to be out of here by morning. I can't be responsible for anything that might happen. -Why, yes. Yes, of course. But what about our business, Dirkson? I should think after all this, you'll be glad to get this place off your hands. -I guess you would at that. -I'll tell you something, Belltower. I'm a very funny man. I don't like being pushed. I have a strange habit of pushing back. There will be transportation to take you to your plane first thing in the morning. Now if you'll excuse me. -Dirkson, if you don't mind, I'd like to wait for my shipment. When are your boats due in? -Sometime tomorrow afternoon. Do you have a copy of the manifest? -Why, yes, yes, but it must be in my office. Although I am sure there's a copy with the cargo. Good. I'll, uh-- PEPI: Mr. Dirkson? -This one is still kicking. I think we can loosen his tongue. -Ask him who killed my brother. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] --[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Ahmed. -Tomorrow morning, we take this island apart. Every stone, tree, and bush. I want Ahmed and his cutthroats, and we better find them. I don't care if we have to burn this whole damn place to the ground to do it. Clean this up for me. -We've got to move fast. If Dirkson discovers those crates of guns aboard his ship, he'll soon figure out our part in this. -But what can we do? -We-- we've to find Ahmed before Dirkson does, or we're finished. -But where? -We must find him. Tonight. At once. I've got to formulate new plans. [AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD] -Marjorie. Marjorie. Where'd your father and Prince Ali go? -What do you mean, "go"? -They just took off in the airplane. -Why should I know? Maybe they just wanted to go sight-seeing or something. What's that? -"Darling, sorry I have some business to attend to. I'll be back this afternoon. Love, Dad." -Good night. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNS BEING COCKED] -Morning, men. -Good morning, Mr. Dirkson. -Everybody here? -Yes sir. -I want every hut and possible hiding place searched. All right, get them loaded. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Did you find? -Nothing, but there are lots of men missing along with Ahmed. -So El Dorado shots are living, huh? -Do you remember who they are? -Most of them. -When they come back, we'll give them a visit. -My boats from Manila are being raided. -What? -Did you find Ahmed? -Now, and if I don't miss my guess, that's why we weren't able to find him. Is the other truck back yet? -No, sir. -Well, just as soon as it gets back, get the men over at the fishing village and into boats as fast as possible. And bring all the guns you can get your hands on. I'll go on ahead. -Yes, sir. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -C'mon, let's get this boat in. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Lasom, Jangboi, get these boats to the island. -Bring them on. -The crew was all dead. Abenah has enough guns and ammunition to start a small war. They let down their sails for disguise. Fire at the boxes. Many are filled with ammunition. Pepi, cut in on the south end of their landing. I'll take the rest of the men and cut in on the north. Now we're going to have to get there before they have chance to distribute the guns and ammunition. Now we're going to move fast. All right, let's go. [SHOUTING] -As soon as those arms are distributed, we must get the plantation before Dirkson gets suspicious. -Belltower, the plane will be ready at your command. -Hurry and get those guns to your men. -Get up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Get out of here. C'mon. You clumsy ox, you. Get a move on. Get out of here. Come on. -Mr. Belltower. Dirkson's boats. what do you mean, Dirkson's boats? -I'm afraid they saw us. They're following. -Well, unpack those guns, and get them to your men as quickly as possible. You, get these men working. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -C'mon, get a move on. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Mr. Belltower? -Well, what is it now? Get those guns to your men? -It's no use. These guns of yours are packed in grease. It will take hours for my men to clean them. -(SHOUTING) Ali, you-- Ali, you idiot. Didn't you check those guns before you shipped them? -I thought I-- -As usual, you didn't. -Ahmed, find the ammunition for our guns. And you, get moving. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNSHOTS] -Ahmed, come here, you damned [INAUDIBLE]. Come here. Ahmed. Ahmed, our whole plan is shot if Dirkson suspects me. I must get back to the plantation. You hold him off, and I promise I'll pay you well. -OK. [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNSHOTS] -Kill him, boss. [GUNSHOTS] -Ali. Ali. Ali. Ali. Ali, I've been hit. -Belltower, your crazy dream is finished. I'm getting out of here. You're through. -You filthy traitor, you. [GROANING] [GUNSHOTS] [COUGHING] -Hi Ahmed. Ahmed? Mr. Dirkson. Mr. Dirkson. Ahmed. Ahmed. Ahmed. Mr. Dirkson. I saw Ahmed. I saw him there. [EXPLOSION] [GUNSHOTS] -Dear brother, I'm going to feed you to the sharks. [LAUGHING] -I'm glad you followed, dear brother John. The last of the Dirksons. All that will be left is the bastard Dirkson. -God forbid that you should be the last of the Dirkson to live in a civilized world. You were late from your conception, bastard. -Bastard. Bastard. [YELLING] [PLANE FLYING OVERHEAD] [GUNSHOTS] -I guess you know how sorry I am that it all turned out the way it did. -I really didn't know anything about his business. You do believe that? -Sure. The trouble with your father and Prince Ali, they dreamed of empires, and they didn't exactly care how they got them. I guess I learned a lot myself. -Well, I guess if you can turn over a new leaf, settle down, I suppose I could give it a try. -Can you make it all right, Pepi? -My wife is a wonderful cook. -Well, I'm a lousy cook, but if you ever want your back scratched again, let me know. So long, lover. -So long. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Tio? Lunch.
