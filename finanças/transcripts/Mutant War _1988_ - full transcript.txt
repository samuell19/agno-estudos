This is what they used to call a city. 10 or so years ago, it would have been alive with noise, and lights, and mobs of people. It's quieter now. There used to be 8 million stories in the city. Now it's down to one. That's me. I'm doing a little shopping. Who I am and what led up to all this, I'll explain later. Right now, something is gonna happen. Huh, what's this? Tasty. That's some aged liquor. Hm. A library. A library. I don't believe it. Huh, who threw this stuff out? Gonna need two extra arms. I read that issue. OK. Let's see. Hm. Ah! What's this? Come on. OK, you asked for it. That's right, pal. Right this way. Say cheese. Where were we? Now I really need a drink. May, my favorite month. Yeah. My name is Harry Trent. To adapt a phrase from one of my favorite books, you don't know me without you have read my memoirs. You haven't read them because there are no publishers left. In my memoirs, I told the truth, mostly, about how the earth was invaded by pig-faced aliens called Liezags, and how they were defeated by a band of heroes and a device called the Neutron-90 bomb. I was one of the heroes. And the Neutron-90 destroyed the invaders by melting them down into goop. It also released an unknown form of radiation, that even its inventor never suspected, which has just played hell with the ecosystem. After we defeated the bad guys, the idea was to start rebuilding civilization and getting things back to normal. But it hasn't worked out that way. It hasn't worked out that way at all. All right. Hey, hey. Hey, come out. I've got a gun here. What? Hey. What's going on? Come here! What? Come on out. It's OK. Look, he's dead. It's safe. Look, he's dead, see? He's not dead. Look, come out. It's OK. Come on, come on. He's not dead. Whoa! Here. I told you so. Now he's dead. Ah! Don't ever do that! For all I know, that thing over there could still be alive. It is still alive. That's better. It's called a car. I know it's called a car. Do I look stupid? So what's your name? Spider. What's yours? Harry Trent. My family talked about you. You're some hero? So where is your family? Dead, mostly. Except for my sisters, who are with them. The Mooks raided our settlement, killed most of our men, took a bunch of us back with them. I got away, and then that thing came after me. Damn! Aw, hell. You should have bought extra. This was my extra. I didn't know it'd be so far between sources. Is that the whole country? The whole country? No, it's just the southern part of the state. What state? How old are you, anyway? Old enough. Everybody's old enough now, kid. It's the southern part of this state. And we're right about here, and there should be gas or something around here. You can come, you can stay. You can do whatever you wanna do. I have to find my sisters. By yourself? I'll find someone who will help me. Good luck! OK, all right, come on. We'll go and find some gas, check out the area. And then we'll see what happens. This is space. The fuzzy green ball is the planet Neptune. It's the eighth planet from the sun, about 3 billion miles from here. And none of our story takes place on Neptune. However, unknown to me while I was looking for gas, company was headed our way. Its makers designate this as a Class 2 starship. Just a little thing, but it'll get you from one star system to another. Right now, it's heading for Earth. We'll see more of it later. There won't be any power for the pumps. There's gotta be a tank around here somewhere. Well, this should work. We need to get some hose. Why don't look around, find buckets, anything you can put more gas in. OK. A-- mo-- amo-- Amoco. OK. Aw, damn. Never do this. It could kill you. Why don't you go see if you can find anything else around here. What, what, what? Run. Run, run! Geez. Ow. You all right? Yeah, I'm OK. OK, well, come on. We'll-- we'll take you back, clean you up. You're a feisty little kid, you know that? This was not the kind of life I envisioned for myself. Saddled with a child? She didn't even look like me. Well, maybe in the nose. I thought you were OK. I'm OK. You're not OK. You're burning up. So? So we gotta get you some place where you can rest. I'm OK. Shut up. Found a well. The water seems OK. We gotta get rid of that fever. I know happened. Bacteria on the animal's skin when it hit you or something. OK. OK, here, drink. I'm going to die? No, you're not. If I die, who'll save my sisters? You're not dying. Who'll save my sisters? Don't worry about that. Everything's gonna be OK. Get through tonight, and you'll be just fine tomorrow. Everybody's dead. Mom's dead. Dad's dead. And now me. Stop it! And then them, Terry and Jen. You-- you-- you'll be all right. Everything will be all right. Then we'll find your sisters, and they'll be all right. Promise? I promise. Dad? I love you, Dad. I love you too, kid. Take it easy. I suppose you're holding me to that promise. What do you mean? You don't remember? No. Well, we'll drive back to the station, fill up the tank, get some extra gas. Well, get in. I have to find my sisters. We can do that after we gas up. What are you waiting for? Get in. Most of them live underground. There are miles of corridors from whatever the place used to be. Like Morlocks. What? Nothing. What are they? They used to be men, I guess. When they attacked your people, did they have weapons? Just clubs and things, like us. But they're so strong, our men didn't have a chance. I don't see any females. There aren't any, not of their kind. Look, look, down there. You see them? Those two women? Are they your sisters? No, two new ones. New ones? What are they gonna do with them? They're not-- they're not cannibals? That and worse. What do you mean, worse? The Mooks are dying out. They can't breed. But they keep trying. I don't know. I can go down and look around. I can lead you. You can stay here. I'm going. No, you're not. I'm going. - You're not! - I'm going! You're not! I'm going! You're not! What about me? Can you shoot? No. Wait. What do you think you're doing? What are you doing? Come here. This is stupid! You're-- you're too damn small. They'll never buy this. - They haven't stopped us yet. - Yeah? Well, it's just a good thing they're morons. Eat this. Ugh. I don't like the looks of this. They haven't got brains enough to do a thing like this by themselves. Someone's guiding them. He's got plans. Look, up ahead! Shh. What are they doing with that lady? Wait! Maybe if we follow them and see where they're taking her can find out where my sisters are. Come on, let's go. Let's follow them. OK. Stay down. No! Man, what are we doing this for? She's not even your sister! Oh, no! What's in there? In and out, OK? I'm gonna go in. Come on. Here. Be quiet! What is this place? See-- can you see anything? It's so dark. Stay close. I can't believe mutants are smart enough to build a colony or something here. Huh? Don't bump into me! Geez. Nothing there. Come on. Do the walk. No, nothing in there. OK. No, I don't like the looks of this place. Wait, I hear something. You can remember what I told you, can't you? Got that? See if you can do it right this time. Now I see what's going on. See if you can do it right. Who's he? The future of your goddamn race is at stake. How the hell should I know? And all my plans. Which is what really counts. Do it right! Do it right! Stupid. No. What? Come on, let's go! This way, this way, this way! Not this way. Come this way, this way! This looks like the way out. Go! Listen. They're not following us. That's what worries me. Look! All right, come on. Let's get out of here. It won't move. We can do it. What's this? Where do these things keep coming from? OK, keep pushing. I'll distract it. Hey, big mouth! Up here, come and get me! Look out, look out! Out of the way! Come on. OK, which way? That way. Quick, turn around. Give me your hands. - No. - Oh, come on. We gotta hurry. No, I refuse. Not again. Look, we can sneak by with these things on, maybe. But if you don't look like our prisoner, they're gonna get you for sure. Please, trust him. He saved both of us. Looks like we're safe. Ugh! All right! Stop, they're friends! What is this? All right, come on! How about a fair fight, maybe like one on one? What do you say? Come on, big guy! I thought she was your prisoner. That's what you were supposed to think. Who are you? Well, this is Spider. I don't know who this is. And I'm Harry Trent. Trent? I've heard-- Everybody has. And it runs? Of course it runs. I haven't seen a car in years. My name is Fox. These men and I are all that's left from our village. The rest were killed and the women taken off. If our women are out there, we're gonna bring them back. How? With sticks and stones? I've got news for you. They got a leader, a human leader. And they're building real weapons. Oh, you have real weapons. Not enough. So what should we do, forget it? Leave the prisoners down there? You got a name, lady? Beth. Well, Beth, we didn't leave you down there, did we? I'm sorry. I haven't even thanked you yet. You're welcome. I got business of my own to do down there. I'm not gonna let these goons get away with what they're doing, but we're gonna do this job right. We're gonna get more weapons, we're gonna get more reinforcements, and then we're gonna go down there and mop up. We've tried. There just aren't any weapons. What did you say? I could be wrong. All right, I need two people to go with me. It's all the car'll take. - I'll go. And me. Me, too. OK, you're going. Listen, this could be dangerous. I'm not afraid. I know you're not, but I am. If you came along, I'd be too worried about you to take care of myself. You-- you stay here, all right? All right, climb in. While we're gone, the rest of you keep low and take care of my kid. Let's have a look. Liezag ship. How sweet. Liezag battlecruiser, Class 856-RNCH. No one on board. Amazing. Pretty damn amazing. Yeah, that's a Liezag skull, OK. I guess there's no business here for me. Still. Sure this is the right way? Yeah. What happened? Blow out. Nobody panic, but we got trouble. Ugh! Shit! Oh, man. Is he OK? What? Yeah, he'll be all right. Hey, you in the car, give yourself up! You in the woods, screw you! Come on! Show yourself! What? Vroom! Vroom. Vrrroom. Shoot. All right, let's get them. Come on, let's get them. Hey, let go of me. Get them. Watch out for the jacket, buddy! Hm. Hey. Rawr. Look at it, guys. We got a car! Yeah. We got guns. Yeah! Do you know what this means? No. It means, we're the big shots around here now! Yeah! We take what we want, and everyone else can kiss our ass! And if they don't like it, they're hamburger! And you guys, know what's going to happen to you? You're gonna invite us to brunch? Close, but not quite. No. We're gonna take everything you've got. Then we're gonna have some fun with her. Then we're gonna kill you all. That was gonna be my next guess. Who the hell are you, wise guy? Harry Trent, schmuck. Never heard of you. OK, guys. Let's party! Usually they've heard of me. Hey, guys! Guys! Hey, you! Hey, peanut brain. Hey, flat lips. Hey, flat lips! What do you want, dog meat? Got a proposition for you. We got everything from you we want. What, a car, some guns? It's nothing. Yeah? Yeah. Listen, here's the deal. You let us go, and we take you to where we got that stuff. And there's plenty more where that came from. Suppose we just make you tell us. Aw, cut it out. You're gonna kill us anyway. Our lives are all you got to bargain with. Get this man something to drink. If you know what I mean. This is great. You got any marshmallows? Here, have a drink. What's that? Just drink it. It'll make you feel good. And it'll make you real honest. Not bad. Beth? Beth? Whoa. Oh, no. Oh. I have to save the planet. Harry! I'm gonna save the planet. I'm gonna-- gonna save the planet. My first date in five years. There's monsters, hideous creatures. The aliens could ruin the planet. No, no. Gotta kill them. Gotta kill the aliens. It's only on the Earth. I'm in-- I'm in space, man. Wow. It's-- no, no. The Ea-- it blew up. It blew up. I saw it. I saw the Earth blow up. It was like right there. I'm looking at the screen and the Earth. It was aliens. And the Earth blew up, right? And then-- then I was-- Aw, man. I'm leaving. Five years, five, five years. Five long years, I was going crazy. I was going-- I was in space for five years. Five years. I was in space for five years. And then I was back on Earth. What a beautiful planet. Mutants. Mutants. And then pig-faced aliens. And then we gotta kill them. I remember we go to the fortress. The fortress and this bomb, this bomb. Nu-- nu-- it's a neutron-- a neutron-50-- neutron-- Neutron-90 bomb. And we blow up all the aliens. But no, it didn't quite work out right, I guess. Now it's mutants today. Oh, no. Some hero I am. No! Wonder where they went. That Trent I don't know. Takes off with the car, he leaves us with the kid. Yeah, stuck with that damn kid. I Don't know. Where did he get that car? I don't know. I haven't seen a car in 20 years. It's a neat car. Probably out of gas now. He says they've got weapons. Where? We looked everywhere. - I saw. I saw one. You saw one. I saw one, remember? Whose nose was this thing shoved up, right? Huh? Sh, wait a minute, guys. I heard something over there. Where are you going? Just wait a minute. I know what I'm doing. I'll be right back, OK? Let me go have a look. Just leave it alone. Pleasant dreams? Yeah, great. Where are we going? To the mutant village. Where's Fox? He's back at the camp. He'll be OK. God, what happened? No. No. Shit, man! Is this what we're up against? She's still alive, Trent. Right. The weapons you want are down there. Coming? Cut the crap, man! There's nothing we want down there. You told us everything while you were out. We came anyway. We like a good fight, but not with bows and arrows against these things. Get the hell out of the car! You're friggin' crazy, man. You, get up. My child, please, get up. Not bad. Young. What are you, a foul cannibal? Get plenty of meat to eat, plenty. Dog. Bitch. And you better produce. You better goddamn well produce. Stop the car. Stop here. We can't take the car in. We need the firepower. We'd attract too much attention. They'd-- you'd never find Spider alive before they stopped you. You now how to use one of these things? Sure. OK, wait here. If it looks like I'm in trouble, come get me. Has anybody-- has anybody seen a little girl, about this tall and wild hair? She's gone. They took her a few minutes ago. Hey, what do we do? You try to escape, they're gonna stop you. But it's up to you. You, have you seen a girl about about-- about your height? Shit. Well, don't leave me! All right, come on. Are you gonna come? Let's go! Ugh! Help me! No! They're crazy, man. They might as well have slit their own throats. If we had weapons, man, we could kick some ass! As if we haven't got enough problems. Sure. Test one, two, three, testing. Are you the dominant indigenous lifeforms? That's us, man. I represent T-Taos, Imagine Munitions. We got a tip that a Liezag is headed your way. That usually means good business. You need a lot of artillery to fight off those Liezag. But you seem to have managed it. Still, keep the card. Wait a second. Hold On you sell guns? That I do. What have you got? Omega N346 plasma automatic. 50K rounds per second. Starblaster, lightning mason rifle. Capable of penetrating neutron star shielding up to 10 centimeters thick. KN837 thermal sidearm. Watch. Useful item. See anything you like? Sure. But what's the price tag? Calculated in local currency, this one is about $37,000. Suppose we just help ourselves? I can use these things as well as sell them. Look, man, there hasn't even been money on this planet since the pig men came. I see. Then I'm wasting my time, aren't I? Hold it. Just a second. I suppose you must barter sometimes, right? Sometimes. What have you got? Somebody get this man a drink. Man. What is this place? Ow, my head. Ow. Take a look at the view. Well, this guy's got some big plans. Well, tough guy? How are you feeling? Fine? Yeah, I feel great. Who are you? Reinhart Rex. Rex, like in "king"? You got it, as in "king." These are my-- Sons? Subjects, my army. I'm in charge here. Wait, don't tell me. I can guess the rest. You're assembling an army of mutants. Then you're gonna spread out and conquer the world. What a perceptive young man. Conquer the world. That's me. Now you. What about you? Who are you? Riley, Doghouse Riley. Well, Mr. Riley, you impressed me. You really did. You made it single handed into the heart of my fortress, slaying a dozen of my formidable genetic creations on your way. I'll tell you something, Riley. I have a problem. Even kings have problems. These mutants of mine, they're incredibly powerful and loyal as dogs. Unfortunately, they're as dumb as dogs, too. I'm coming to realize that if my army is going to be effective, I'm going to need men like you, young lieutenants, tough, resourceful, to keep my troops in line. You're offering me a job? Yes, I'm offering you a job, Mr. Riley. No, I don't think so. Are you quite sure? yeah Positive? Mm-hm. Then I guess I'm gonna have to kill you. I figured. Wait, no hasty decision. I'd like to take you on a tour. Great. OK? Then I'll kill you. Wait, what are you doing? We have to wait. He's gonna signal! Did he tell you what the signal was? No. Then let's go for it. All right. Go for it! Look, Mr. Riley. My latest model, and my best. A monster. The trouble is, I haven't been able to breed the bastards. But with him, I have my best chance. Especially, since we have a younger partner. Let go, you stupid Mook. Ah-hah. There she is, Mr. Riley. Hello, little cannibal. Trent. What? Somebody you know? Then what's the matter? She's just a kid. But that's the point. That's what I just told you, a younger partner! Can you imagine that? Huh? Would you like to see it, huh? Stop it! Let's get the chains off. What took you so long? All right, Riley. If that's the way you wanna die, help yourself. It's moving. Huh? Oh, shit. It's coming. Get him, get him! Kill him, monster. Kill him! Come on, harder, harder! Come on, Trent. More, come on. Whoa! Get up, get up. Come on, you can do it. Get up. Get him. Kick him in the balls! Please, Mr. Riley, not there. I'm trying to breed him! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, you stupid monster? Trent, kill him already. Mr. Riley, you can't avoid him all day. You'll get tired. He never will. Choke him choke him, come on! I'm doing-- Bye-bye, Mr. Riley. Bye-bye. OK. Guards, kill him! Kill the son of a bitch! Kill him! Kill him! No! No! No! Die, you sucker! All right! Nice weapons. Remember the drink? Yeah. Same one we gave you, we gave the arms dealer. We got the guns. It sure works. Oh. OK. Easy. You look like hell. I feel just fine. I don't know how to thank you. You could if we had time. I'm glad we didn't kill you, hero. Yeah, me too. It was a blast, man. We'll have to do it again sometime. Forget something? No, it's nothing. Hey, Trent. Are you Trent? Yeah. Our little sister couldn't stop talking about you last night. Oh, so you're-- you're Spider's sisters. Thank you. You could stay with us. You could stay with us, help us rebuild. No. No, thanks. I got-- I got hero stuff to do. Take care of my-- take care of the kid. Where'd you learn that? Taught myself. Pretty good. Where are we going? Well, I don't know where I'm going, but you are going back home. You're leaving me? You love me! I hate that kind of talk. You risked your goddamn life for me. You love me! Maybe I do. But I refuse to give into it. I'll be back. Promise? Screw you, too. Yeah, love you, too, kid.
