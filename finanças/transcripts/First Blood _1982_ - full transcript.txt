All right, Coming in, - Come on. Get back, - Move back, you guys, Move back, Captain, can we have a comment on what's happening? How bad is the situation? Captain, we need some... Dnly good thing to come out of this mess,, . Is the business we're doing in town. Reporters are drinking the place dry. You look like you're ready to keel over, Will. Why don't you go home? It's my problem now. Your problem? Listen, Dave, don't give me any of your horseshit about jurisdiction on this one, you understand? Would you like me to step outside? Just finish up what you're doing, Somewhere in this rugged mountain countryside, possibly above the snow line, shrouded in mist, the fugitive John Rambo is hiding. Units of the state police, along with local members of the National Guard., . Are now being mobilized, What still remains unexplained by local authorities., . Is just how and where the former Green Beret., . Came into possession of the weapons with which, ., he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff., . And tried to kill six others. Dnly their skilled training in police enforcement techniques saved their lives. Word is that the fugitive will be in custody in a matter of hours, Here's the maps, Will, Will, there's something I think you ought to know. Talk to you later. Dkay? What is it, Lester? What is it? Spit it out! Well, I was, I was just talking to Mitch, and he was saying that Galt and a couple deputies,, . Were, uh, a little hard on the guy, Assholes! Doesrt make one goddamn bit of difference, Dave, and you know it! Look, if one of my deputies,, . Gets out of line with a prisoner, then the prisoner comes to me with it! If I find out it's like he says, I kick the deputy's ass! Me! The law! That's the way it's got to be! People start fuckir around with the law., . And all hell breaks loose! Whatever possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo? God didn't make Rambo. - I made him. - Who the hell are you? Sam Trautman, Colonel Samuel Trautman. We're a little busy, Colonel What can I do for you? - I've come to get my boy. - Your boy? I recruited him, I trained him. I commanded him in Vietnam for three years. I'd say that makes him mine, I wonder why the Pentagon would send a full -bird Colonel down here to handle this. The Army thought I might be able to help, I don't know in what way, Rambo's a civilian now. He's my problem, I don't think you understand. I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you, I came here to rescue you from him, Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel I will try to be extra careful I'm just amazed that he allowed any of your posse to live, Is that right? Strictly speaking, he slipped up. You're lucky to be breathing. That's just great! Colonel, you came out here to find out., . Why one of your machines blew a gasket. You don't seem to want to accept the fact, ., that you're dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare. With a man who's the best, ., with guns, with knives, with his bare hands, A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke, In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of enemy personnel To kill. Period, Win by attrition, Well, Rambo was the best, Okay, Colonel, you got us all scared to death, What do you and the Special Forces think I ought to do, ., about your psycho out there? Let him go. - Do what? - For now, Diffuse the whole situation. Diffuse him, Provide a little gap and let him slip through it. Then put out a nationwide APB, In a couple of weeks, you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace, working in a car wash, There'll be no fight, Nobody else will get hurt. I do my own work, I won't close my eyes and hope he gets picked up in Seattle. If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed, We're just a small, hick town sheriff's department, but we're expected to do our duty., . Just like our heroes in the Special Forces, In Special Forces, we teach our people to stay alive in the line of duty. I never thought of that. You want a war you can't win? Are you telling me that 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation for us? You send that many, don't forget one thing. What? A good supply of body bags. Trautman! I don't know which side you're on, Trautman. I still think you came out here just to cover your ass, But if you're serious about taking Rambo out clean, follow me. Dang, State Police calling John Rambo. Acknowledge. State Police calling John Rambo. Come in, please. Acknowledge. If you're listening, Rambo, here is your situation. You are surrounded. Every possible exit has been blocked, Every highway, every road, every firebreak, You have our word that your services to your country, ., will be taken into consideration, and you will receive fair treatment, Just respond, We can work everything out. Dver. Anything? He took a radio off of one of my deputies, Then he has to be listening. If I was in his position, I'd try to pick up information, - Maybe catch some cross talk, - Df course he's listening. But he's not gonna break radio silence, No, Not for us, But he might do it for you, Colonel He's your boy, isn't he? Maybe you can talk him into, ., sparing all our lives by giving himself up, I can try. At least, we'll get a radio fix on his position, if you don't mind setting him up for us, Setting him up for you? It 's like bringing the pigeons to the cat, Son of a bitch, Hey, Don, thanks for bringing your people out. Any time, Will, Bobby, put the magazine away, Pay attention. We may only get one crack at this, Covey Leader calling Raven. Come on, Raven. Covey Leader calling Raven. Covey Leader to Raven. Talk to me, Johnny. Covey Leader to identify Baker Team, Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta, Jorgensen, Danforth, Barry, Krackauer, Confirm, This is Col. Trautman. Talk to me, Johnny. They're all gone, sir. It's him. Get on it. Rambo, are you all right? Over. Baker Team, they're all dead, sir, Not Delmar Barry. He made it. Barry's gone too, sir. How? Got himself killed in Nam, Didrt even know it, Cancer ate him down to the bone, I'm sorry, I didn't know. I'm the last one, sir, It's good to hear your voice, Johnny. It's been a long time. Look, John, you've done some damage here, - That's it. Northwest. - But they don't want any more trouble, He's northwest. That's why I've come, I'm gonna come in there and fly you the hell out. Just you and me. We'll work this thing out together. Is that fair enough? Where'd you come from, sir? Bragg. I tried to reach you, but the guys at Bragg never knew where to find you, I haven't been spending much time there lately. They've got me down in D.C. I'm shining a seat with my ass. I wish I was back at Bragg now, We'll talk about that when you come in, I can't do that, sir. Well, look, John, we can't have you runnir around wastir friendly civilians. There are no friendly civilians. I'm your friend, Johnny. I was there with you knee-deep in all that blood and guts. I covered your ass more than once. Seems like bailir you out of trouble is gettir to be a lifetime job for me. There wouldn't be no trouble except for that king-shit cop. All I wanted was something to eat, but the man kept pushing, sir. You did some pushing of your own, John, They drew first blood, not me. Look, Johnny, let me come in and get you the hell out of there. They drew first blood. Rambo, are you still reading me? Covey Leader to Raven, Rambo, acknowledge. He's all finished, Colonel We've got a real good fix on him, though. Come first light, I'm gonna put every man I got up on that ridge, Then we'll get him my way, All right, look down. I want you to stretch the skirmish line, ., - right across this ridge. - Goddamn it, Goddamn it. Come on. Let's go. Over here, Come on! Move it! Let's go, Hey, this guy got a gun? Watch your step, What was that? What was that? Which way did he go? Toss it across. Toss it, Pa! Pa! Pa! - There's a guy over there! - What happened, son? - I see him! Dver there! - I' II get him! Don't shoot! Cool down! This way! Let's go! There he is! Come on! Whoo! Now we got him! Yes, Yes, I know exactly where it is. Listen to me very carefully, Surround the area with every man you've got, but don't move in. I repeat, don't move in, In fact, don't do anything 'til I get there, And no shooting. I don't want him dead. I want him alive. Get down! Keep firir! Come on, guys, Shoot! Come on! Oh, you guys are great, - All right, Steve? - Yo? I want you and Bruce, head around these trees, go to the front of that mine, Screw that, Clinton, I ain't goir up there, No way, - Raymond? - What? - I want you to go into that mine. - Dh, not me, - What do you mean, ' not me '? - Look, I do this part-time, I didn't come to get killed. He's probably in there just waitir for us. What's wrong with you, Clinton? All right, Rambo? This is Lieutenant Clinton Morgen, National Guard leader, Now, I'm giving you just three-zero seconds to come on out! Who's got the rocket launcher? - I do, - Come here, Earl Great, Rambo, this is your last chance to come out, Maybe we should wait, Earl, this creep is a killer, Besides, I' m in charge, and I say we blow it up. Now fire that thing, Just let me get out of the way first, - Whoo! - Yeah! Give that man a cigar! Bull 's-eye! - Where the hell are they? - Up the hill about 500 yards, Move in a little closer, just like Iwo Jima, I don't believe it. - Idiots! - Steady, Got it, All right, Nick. Dne more for Soldier of Fortune. Soldier of Fortune? Damn it! What the hell do you think this is? Some kind of a circus? Get the hell out of here! Clinton, Jesus. Didrt you get the word? I told you people to wait until I got up here! He was shootir at us, Will, Come on, I wasrt takir any chances, Christ, what a mess, We're gonna have to dig his body out of there right away, You can't get a dozer up here, You'll have to find somebody to dig him out, It's your mess, Clinton, You clean it up, Will, come on! I gotta be back at the drugstore tomorrow, Then you better get started right away, Clinton! Shit! Buried in a hole by a bunch of goddamn weekend warriors. I thought you said he was the best you ever trained, However he may have ended up, there was a time when he was very special Special, my ass, He's just another drifter that broke the law, Vagrancy, wasrt it? That's gonna look real good... on his gravestone at Arlington, "Here lies John Rambo, winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines, killed for vagrancy in jerkwarter, U.S.A." Now don't give me any of that crap, Trautman. You think Rambo was the only guy who had a tough time in Vietnam? He killed a police officer for Christ sake! You' re goddamn lucky he didn't kill all of ya. This character, he comes waltzing in here full of all kinds of good advice,, . On how we should let the goddamn maniac go loose so we can save our own asses! We saved our asses, Colonel, and we didn't let him go loose! The best man lost! And he doesn't like it! - How ya doir, Will? - Hold my calls. Colonel? Have a seat, Dh, miss, would you do this again, please? - Hi, sheriff. - And for my friend, Give me a shooter. Wild Turkey, Look, if I was out of line before, well, I just want to apologize. None of that makes much difference now, does it? Nah, I guess not, I suppose, ., I don't know, I just feel., Like you were cheated out of your chance, I wanted to kill that kid, I wanted to kill him so bad I could taste it, Doesrt sit well with that badge, hmm? It can get confusing sometimes. In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and I got pretty confused. But we had orders. When in doubt, kill. What the hell, you're a civilian, You can go home to your wife and your house and your little flower garden, You're under no pressure to figure all this out. What about you, Colonel? What did you figure out from all of this, huh? What would you have done with him if he came in? Would you wrap your arms around him, give him a big, sloppy kiss? Dr would you have blown his brains out? I couldn't answer that until I met him face-to-face. Yeah. Well, there it is. It's just as well we never got a chance to find out. Hmm, Drive. Don't look at me, look at the road, That's how accidents happen. - What's your name? - Cathcan't, Robert A, All right, what do ya got in the back, Robert A.? M60, Dkay, Robert A,, get outta the truck. Dh, please, I got no beef with you. No! Go on! Move! Go! Whoa! SP Car 1, Charlie 5 to central Want to turn that up? Are we still on that three-way hookup? Sheriff Teasle' s office, Roger. Still working. What's your story, Steamboat? Looks like somebody pulled the plug too soon. That Rambo guy is on the loose again. Shit. Roger, Steamboat. This is Trapper. We 're setting up roadblocks on Highway 26. Hey, Will, it's Rambo, He's still around, Holy fuck! All right, get out there right away, Move! What the hell is goir on anyway? - Watch yourself! - They're all gonna blow! Attention all civilians, For your own safety, please evacuate the streets immediately. Remain indoors until you receive further instructions. I repeat, this is a police emergency. Please evacuate the streets immediately. We found Rambo's body. As a matter of fact, it stole an Army truck, blew up a gas station, The kid is resilient, Forget what you're thinkir and clear out while you can. Get the fuck outta here. Take your advice with you. When I talked to you earlier, you knew he was still alive, didn't you? - I suspected. - Yeah, sure, That's why you stuck around, You trained him. You taught him how to get out of places like that cave, But he's not gonna get out of this place, Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before, What makes you think you can handle him now? Because God knows what damage he's perpared to do. You're gonna die, Teasle. Everybody dies, There's only one man in this room that's got half a chance, That's not because I'm better than he is. It's because he trusts me. See, I' m the closest thing to family he has left. That may be all the edge I need. Jesus Christ, where do you people come from? No, No, this is my job, Trautman, This is my town, I'm not giving it up to you or to Rambo or to anybody else. Now, you just stay the hell out of my way. - Get a little closer! - I can't! It's too goddamn hot! Will, this is Lester. Do you copy? Dver, Come on, let's go! Will, this is Lester. Do you copy? Dver, Listen, Will, we got some serious problems. The highway's been cut off. The truck's out here, but we couldn't find the body. I repeat, no body. It's totally burned out. Preston, get those people outta here! Hey! Move 'em back to the south side. Move back! Move back! Listen, Will we don't know how many... gasoline reservoirs there are under those gas pumps. - Do you copy? Over. - We got a reporter here. Preston, push them back! I don't care who he is! Move them around! Get the trucks to the other side! Come on! Let's go! Will, do you copy? Over. Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Go ahead, Go ahead, Go ahead, you crazy son of a bitch! Finish! Rambo! Rambo, don't do it! Listen to me, Rambo. You have no chance. So drop your weapon. I'm gonna order the chopper in to fly you back to Bragg, Hold your fire! Kern! Hold your fire, Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Think about what you're doing, The building's perimeter is covered, No exits. There are nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s. You did everything to make this private war happen. You've done enough damage! This mission is over, Rambo. Do you understand me? This mission is over! Look at 'em out there, Look at 'em! If you don't end this now, they're gonna kill you, Is that what you want? It's over, Johnny, - It 's over! - Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasrt my war! You asked me, I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win! But somebody wouldn't let us win! Then I come back to the world, and I see all those maggots at the airport.,, protestir me, spittir, callir me ' Baby Killer' and all kinds of vile crap! Who are they to protest me, huh? Who are they, unless they've been me and been there and know what they're yelling about! It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now, For you! For me, civilian life is nothing! In the field, we had a code of honor: You watch my back, I watch yours, - Back here there's nothing! - You're the last of an elite group. Don't end it like this. Back there I could fly a gunship, I could drive a tank, I was in charge of million-dollar equipment! Back here I can't even hold a job parking cars! Fuck it. Dh. Geez, Oh, God. Where is everybody? Oh, God. I had a friend, it was Danforth. I had all these guys, man. Back there I had all these flaky guys who were my friends. Back here there's nothing. Remember Danforth? He wore this black headband. I took one of his magic markers and it said, "If found. Mail us to Las Vegas" 'cause we were always talkirs about Vegas. And his fuckir car, this red '58 Chevy convertible. He was talkir about this car. He said we were gonna cruise 'til the tires fall off, We go in this bar in Saigon, and this kid comes up carrying a shoe shine box. And he says, "Shine, please, Shine,' I said no. He kept askir, and Joey said yeah, And I went to get a couple beers, And the box is wired, And he opened up the box. Fuckir blew his body all over the place, And he's layir there, He's fuckir screamir, There's pieces of him all over me, Just, ., like this. And I'm tryir to pull him off, my friend that's all over me! I've got blood and everything. I'm tryir to hold him together. I'm puttir the guy's fuckir insides keep comir out! And nobody would help! Nobody would help! He's sayir, " I wanna go home, I wanna go home." He keeps callir my name. "I wanna go home, Johnny. I wanna drive my Chevy." I said, ' Why I can't find your fuckir legs. I can't find your legs,' I can't get it out of my head, I dream it seven years. Every day I have this, Sometimes I wake up, I don't know where I am, I don't talk to anybody. Sometimes a day, sometimes a week. I can't put it out of my mind, Fuck it, It's a long road When you're on your own And it hurts when They tear your dreams apart And every new town Just seems to bring you down Trying to find peace of mind Can break your heart It's a real war Right outside your front door I tell ya Out where they'll kill ya You could use a friend Where the road is That's the place for me Where I'm me in my own space Where I'm free. That's the place I wanna be 'Cause the road is long, yeah Each step is only the beginning No breaks, just heartaches Oh, man, is anybody winning It's a long road And it's hard as hell Tell me what do you do To survive When they draw first blood That's just the start of it Day and night, you gotta fight To keep alive It's a real war Right outside your front door I tell ya Out where they'll kill ya You could use a friend 'Cause the road is long, yeah Each step is only the beginning No breaks, just heartaches Oh, man, is anybody winning The road is long, yeah Each step is only the beginning No breaks, just heartaches Oh, man, is anybody winning It's a long road It's a long road
