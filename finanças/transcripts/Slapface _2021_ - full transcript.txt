You know why we have to do this. You ready? Oh, my gosh, Jesus Christ, Tom, make a real sandwich. I know how to make a sandwich. No, you don't. - Hey, bud. - Hey. I know you're still with me. I love you. Uh, can I get a Sprite and tequila? Yeah. Fancy drink. I have discriminating taste. That's a cool place for a tat. What is it? Guess. Some people can't. Elephant. Very good. I got it my semester abroad in Thailand. Female elephants band together to raise their offspring, whereas the males go roaming off on their own. Funny, huh? - Like... - Tom. Hi, Sheriff. How about a word outside, Tom? The Kenyans saw him running down on North Lane, and if I didn't pick him up, for sure, he would have got into more trouble. What'd he do? I took care of it. Tom, I know you're trying your best and you're working, which is great. Yeah. Thanks, John. Your mom, may she rest in peace, would have been proud of you, but I don't think she would feel the same way about Lucas right now. You understand I'm trying to cut you slack... because of Nora. She didn't want you boys to be like your old man. And I know that you're better than that. I just hope you don't prove me wrong. You maybe want to take Lucas fishing again? I know he looks up to you. Tom, I have my job. You have your job, and your job is to straighten out your brother. You're running out of "get out of jail free" cards. You understand? Say it. I understand. Okay. Harder. Stop trying to get arrested. Sheriff says you're running out of "get out of jail free" cards. Sheriff Thurston says, "I loved your mother." I'm serious. Go to bed. Hey. Um, what... what was that? We were just playing Slapface. Are you... okay? You seem okay. It smells good. Hey, go wake up your brother. - Why? - Go. Just do it. - Need my help? - No. Get out. - Go, go, shoo. - Okay. Wake up. Say it again. No, no, no, keep it up. Tell me the story. Oh, hey, I made you some eggs. Okay, I guess he, uh, doesn't like eggs. Help! Help! Help, someone! Someone, help! Help! Come back, here pig! Wait, wait! Cease fire! Cease fire? Fuck you! Okay, okay. Cease fire. Come on, you. Come here. Come here, or the truce is over. You have to choose... fast. Say you're sorry. Sorry for whatever I've done. I don't believe you. Get off! Ow! Why did you steal Moriah's notebook and her pen? Get off! Ow, ow, ow! Stop it! Why did you steal Moriah's notebook and her pen? She gave it to me! You're a liar. Tell the truth. It was there, okay?! Stop stalking Moriah, you little turd face. She doesn't even like you. Now... nod your head and say yes! Yes, yes! Okay?! Get up! Get away. Wait. How bad do you want to be part of the Nightshades? Girls only. We can make him pull his pants down. How about a dare? Alright.

Three minutes, and you can only come out if you bring us a gift. Go. Get in there. Would you go in there? No fucking way. Can I go into town? For what? Want to go shopping? Get a purse. Yeah, is that better than, what, do you want to stay here and chop wood and stuff? Is that...? Isn't it... scary... being all the way out here in the woods? No. Want to know why? Want to show you something. Got it from my dad. Want to hold it? Okay. Scary. It's loaded. - Really? - Yeah. Keep a loaded gun next to your bed? Yes, ma'am. Hey, what's going on down there? What can you see? I don't know. It's dark. There's blood on the floor. Rose, how much time is left? Just another 30 seconds. What happened? Sorry, I ran away. Did you see it? See what? Okay, I don't want us to break up. Are we dating? No, I just... me and you. No one else will ever know. It's our secret. Moriah, listen. I saw something. Call me. - That was really bad. - That was awful. That was... We're gonna try again. We're gonna try again. - Okay, thanks. - Alright. Wait, don't... Okay. Alright, so keep the bend in your elbows. Oh, sorry. Okay. Spread your legs a little wider. Spread your legs a little wider. Spread your legs a little bit more. Okay. And look down the barrel. - Okay. - Breathe in. Breathe out and pull the trigger. - Oh, fuck yeah! - There you go! There you go. Let's try it again. - Let's try it again. - I did it! Okay. What the fuck, guys? It's not that bad. Aah! Hey, ouch. What happened to your hand? Nothing. Usually, I'm the chef around here, so... Yeah? Well, maybe... maybe we can make something together sometime. I make a mean bibimbap, so... What is this one, a chick playing the ukulele? That one I got in Jersey. She's got some pretty nice boobs. Kind of like somebody else I know. I need... I need to take my pants off. You want to help me? Saw a monster today. - What? - Nothing. Cut myself. Wait... - Can I see? - Come on, he's fine. Wait, I think that you should put some, um, you should put some ice on it. No, some, uh, some iodine. Wait, I... uh, maybe I have something in my bag. He knows where the iodine is. I'll let you guys have your date. Wait, no, you haven't even finished your food.

Hey, bud, come here for a sec. You got a secret? That girl... she came by again. What girl? My advice? Make herchase you. Stop talking like Dad. Hey, Lucas, why don't you drink a nice, tall glass of go fuck yourself? Little shit. So I saw your friend sneaking around. What friend? You know... your girlfriend. She didn't bring me the flowers, if you're wondering.

You know, is she the one that's... she the one that's hurting you? She's doesn't hurt me. She's my friend. Hey, did you know that I'm a witch? Yeah. Check it out. I'm a Wiccan. It's like... good witchcraft. Their premise is harm none, so it's not all... drinking blood and sacrificing babies. How do you become a Wiccan? Ride a broom or something? Yeah. No, my dad was an evangelical. Do you know that is? I haven't seen him in 15 years. Hmm. My parents are dead. So what'd you guys talk about? Monsters. That's cool. We both got girlfriends now. No, we don't. No means no, and always wear a condom. My drunk brother has a new girlfriend. It's like she lives here now. Do you like her? She said she's a witch. She good or bad? I don't know. I can have her make a spell to kill the twins. I'm sorry they're so mean to you, but they're my only friends. You know how it is. Can I come over? What, to my house? Yeah. Right now. No, my mom would flip out. She's nuts. She might really like me. No, she's totally crazy. Like, "pick up a chair and shake it around" type of crazy. My mom's bipolar, you know? That... doesn't scare me. You there? Where'd you go? I-I'm right here, talking to you. What does he even do? Do you even know? Yes, he fucking goes out and he hangs out, - and that's what all kids do. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, are the fucking expert? You're here for like a couple of days, and you fucking... Why can't you just let it go?! - Alright? - You want me to go? - Okay, fine, fine! I'll go. - Fuck off, Anna! Hey! - Gross, don't look at us. - Ew, get away, fuck stick! I got this from Wakefield. Yeah, nobody pay attention to him. Just ignore his ass. No, you listen. Aww, are you a loser like your brother? Yeah, loser. Is that why you want to join the Nightshades? To not be a loser? Jesus Christ, guys. We made a deal. I think he wants to get in with us, huh? Is that it? - Aww, how cute. - You want to get in with us? Ew, stop, no boys in the pool! No penises in the pool. God, get out! - Get out. That's so disgusting. - Gross. - Jesus, why would... - So skinny and gross. Jesus, why would he even come here? God, he's just like his brother. Aah! Aah! This is the third funeral I've been to. My uncle was the second. Casket was half-closed. Like this. Tom made a joke and said... "Maybe he's not wearing pants." "The dead guy, maybe he's not wearing pants." Come on, let's go. It's just dog's blood. Just tell us about it. We're here to listen. Why should I tell you? You weren't even here. You heard him. It was dog's blood. This isn't a joke. You guys need to talk to someone. Talk to who? You? I can listen, but... it's not the same thing. The first sign of something going wrong, you just leave. You just up and ghost, and you don't even say goodbye. You don't... I don't know when you're gonna come back. You can't just leave for two days and expect us to be all warm and fuzzy when you show up. That's what I thought. You know, my brother used to trap insects under glass and pour salt on them. He thought it was funny, too. Now he's in jail. Yeah, and that's yourbrother. Stop telling me how to raise mine. My little brother is none of your fucking... Do you ever wonder what he does with himself? I mean, where he goes all day long. How about you don't worry about him. If you want to talk, let's talk about us. No, and if he goes too far, you'll just... you'll play a little game of Slapface. I mean, where did you learn that? I'm not abusing my kid brother! - It's not normal! - Shut the fuck up! You don't get it. It's something just for us, something to... to clear the shit away. Yeah, because all I'm seeing is some serious fucking chaos! What? What, are you gonna hit me, too? I don't hit women. No. Just little boys. Stupid. Come on. Just take my hand. Do this for me. Let's just sit on the steps. No. I promise I won't let anything bad happen to you. Come, let's just meet my friend. She's nice. No, everything about this place is bad. I-It's just bad, okay? Date's over. I'm done. Moriah! Hey, there. Can I have one? I guess. They never found the body. These ones get it wrong. She doesn't eat up the bad kids. She's their friend. Oh, the twins are waiting for me. I got to go, but I'll see you later. Tom? Hello? Hello? Who's that? Hello? Tom, i-it's Anna. Say something. Tom, I have your gun. Lucas? Yeah? Is he alright? Okay, fine, I'll pick him up. Anna, we got to go pick up Tom. Anna? Hey, Anna? Why do you have cowgirl boots on? I have no idea what you're saying, but it's so sexy. Just give me one straight answer. Is... Tom, have you seen Anna? Hey, this is my little brother, Lucas... - Stop it. - ...here to join us. - Lucas... - Have you seen Anna? Do you know if Italy's shaped like a boot? She's Italian, but she won't tell me, and... Her car's at home, but she's not there. Well, at least she didn't take two days to come back this time. Lucas, it's time for you to go. - It's time for youto go, Joe. - Go where? - What are you talking about, Tom? - Get me another fucking beer. - You don't need a fucking beer. - Did you and Anna have a fight? Don't fucking call me Tommy. - Give me my fucking... - Answer me! - Don't fuck this up for me. - Tom. - What? - Stop. Hey, it's Tom. Yeah, I'm not gonna make it today. Where are you?! Come on out! Come out! I know you're there! Come out! Come out! I know you're there! Come out! Come out! Excuse me. There's a girl staying here. Her name's Anna. I was wondering if you've seen her. Why don't you tell me? You're driving her car. Lucas, come here. I want to show you something. Can you tell me anything about that? That's a .357 Magnum. Been fucking around with dad's gun? We don't hide things from each other. - Did you hurt her? - No. Then tell me what happened! We gonna play Slapface? This isn't a game. I'm not playing. Did she... Did she come home? Did she... start a fight, get in your face, piss you off? You get Dad's gun to try to scare her? Maybe the monster got her! I'm done with that shit! Do you want her to go out and get a social worker and take you away?! Is that what you want?! We're all we've got, man. Just us. Now, tell me what happened. Don't be such an idiot, Moriah. Maxi pads go on the outside of your underwear. Do you want to get blood all over your clothes? So why did you change your hair like that? The Nightshades wear blue. You know, Moriah, I didn't want to say anything, but... it makes your hair look kind of ugly. I mean, look at her. Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a nightmare. - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - You girls have fun? - Yeah, totally. Everything okay, sweetie? Yeah. Everything's great. Lucas? Lucas? Will you get my beer? My little baby bro. My... My bigbaby bro. Thank you. I was thinking maybe we... we could go to Florida. Hey. Sit down. You know, because we haven't been there since... Mom and Dad. I can't stop thinking about that night. I knew Dad was gone on impact, but... I keep picturing Mom. Her face right before the air bags went off... ...and we couldn't get out, and then we did, and the water was so cold and it was rushing and I thought she was behind us, but... I thought she was behind us. We promised not to talk about that. Why do you have to be such a jerk when you're with the twins? - What? - Nothing. Maybe we can play a game called Slapface? What's that? What was that? Tom! Tom, what's wrong?! What happened? What?! You see him? - There he is! - Oh! - Get a weapon! - Get it, get it! He's behind the couch! Where'd it go? Where'd it go? - It's... It's this way! - This way? - Yeah. - Where'd it go? - He's going this way. - Where... There he is! Get him! Oh! Frick! You picked the wrong house, little guy. Got him. Okay, I-I have to go. Moriah, wait! Moriah! No, I'm leaving, okay? We're breaking up. Just stay away from me. Just let her go, man. Let's go inside. Tom, come on! Let's go! Oh, you get your beauty sleep, princess? Put... that... back. Give it to me! This isn't a joke! Let go! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! - Later. - Later. Lucas? Did Anna come back? Oh, shit, oh shit. Get in, and don't come out! Don't come out until I say, no matter what! Understand?! Stay! We're gonna play Slapface. This is gonna hurt. You ready? Again. Harder. Harder. This is our house, man. We live here. Look at me! What happened with Anna? What happened to Anna?! I love you, Tom. I love you so much, Tom. I love you. You can't hit me anymore. She'll hurt you. Who? Anna? What happened? What's this doing out? Is she the monster? She the one that's hurting you? - Stop! - Get his arm. Stop it! Stop! Get off! This is what you get for stalking our friend. Stop it! Get off of me! - Get up! - Stop! Moriah! Spit on him. - No, no! - Do it! Moriah, don't! She'll hurt you, too! Don't! Now take his pants off. Let's see his little wiener. We'll hold him. You get his belt. Stop! Stop! What was that? - Oh! - Oh! Fuck. Are you okay? Let's get him. Where did he go? Oh, oh, I saw him run that way. Come on! We're gonna get you, Lucas! Oh! Here's over there, come on! Spread out. Come out, come out, wherever you are! Lucas! I know you're out there! Where are you? Hey! Just me. You there? Look, please come out and talk to me. I know you're really mad at me. I was scared. I'm really sorry. Lucas? Moriah! You okay? Wake up. Wake up. This is not a joke. Wake up. I know you're... help! Help me, please! Guys, guys, help! Help me! Moriah. This isn't funny. Wake up. Help! Help, anyone! You. You did this, didn't you? Stop it! You stupid... Sheriff Thurston. Let me talk to him. No chance. Please. I just got to see him. You better find yourself a lawyer. It's not my job to recommend one. Get out of here, Tom. So there are monsters. Lucas, sometimes... we do terrible things. We can't help ourselves. Want to tell me what happened? Want me to guess? I'm not a psychic. Virago. First... she was a breeze. Then she was a tree. I grew up down on Bowling Lane, not far from where you guys are at. The monster's real, Sheriff Thurston. You know... your mother asked me to stop coming by because your father was acting crazy. She was trying to protect me. I remember how mad you got when the last time I saw her. You were kicking the walls and smashing plates. You were batshit crazy. I didn't want you to leave. Mm, you've got a temper. Virago. Come on, son. Tell me the truth. Who was the monster, Lucas? Are you the monster, Lucas? - No! - Come on. - She's gone. - Baby! I'm sorry. She got hurt real bad. Come on. Come on, we got to go. - Babe, we got to go. - Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Sometimes, really bad things happen. Thank God you two are safe. Sir, are you a member of a family? I really think you need to leave. If you want to know anything else, talk to the police. - Go home, Tom. - Get your hands off me. You already know what happened. Why don't you get off my car? Why don't you get lost? Mr. "get out of jail free" card. Brother's in real deep shit now. This is Leggett. What's your 10-2? Come back to the station. Jesus Christ, it's horrible. Copy. We're on the move. Lucas. Come home. There's something I got to know. Are you good? Or evil? I want to believe you're good... ...but you hurt so many people. So you must be evil. S-So there's something I've got to know. Was it all because of me? We can't be friends. Lucas! Tom? No. No! No! No! No! Tom? Tom! It's Slapface! It's Slapface! Stop it! Tom! Wake up. Wake up! Tom. Wake up! Wake up! Tom, wake up! Wake up! Tom! Wake up! Wake up! Tom, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
