[Sci-fi Ambience] [Inspirational Strings] - Hi, how are you? - Oh, come on. [background noise drowns out speaker] Sir? Hi, John, how's it going, guys? Group hug. [slow orchestral music] The Trimbles? The Trimbles, you mean the tribbles? It's those little furry things from the original series, I think. Yeah, Trouble With Tribbles, classic Star Trek. - I love the tribbles. - The tribbles? Oh, I don't. Tribbles, not Trimbles. Trimbles, no, unfortunately, I don't. Yes, like Bjo, yeah. She started a writing campaign years ago go to save the show. Bjo Trimble, the lady who saved Star Trek. The reason that Bjo is better known than me is every Tom, Dick, and Harry's name is John, Bjo, how often do you come across that name? So it stuck in everybody's mind. It works to make up a name. It bothers me more than it bothers John that he didn't, doesn't get credit. And what bothers me is that it bothers her. [Laughs] The Trimbles, they were great fans of the show, you'd think they owned part of the show. I'm not sure they didn't. [slow music] You know, they weren't going to have Star Trek off the air, without them, I don't know where Trek would have gone. Bjo Trimble did lead, and her husband John, a letter writing campaign, and that was, if not the only reason, the reason that the show wasn't canceled. It's still a thrill to have fans come up to us, adults now, and say, "I wrote a save Star Trekletter" "when I was a kid." [John] Star Trek's been really good to us in that respect, we didn't make any money off of it, but we've been all over the world, really, and it's all because of Star Trek. [Bjo] We've been a couple for, in another couple of weeks, it's for 56 years. Actually, a little longer than that, 'cause we were. Yeah, well. Sort of, biblically, we knew each other before we got married. I'm not, I don't think you're supposed to say that on film. [John laughs] So, hey. [upbeat music] Even though a lot of fan campaigns haven't worked, you always go in with the hope that it's going to work, the only thingy have available to you is hope. No show is truly dead, another network could pick it up, you could be saved at the last moment. I didn't think it was a problem, at the time, I didn't think it was crazy that I loved the show so much that I made it my personal life's mission to bring it back. We had CNN calling, we had the New York Times calling. You know, I had a day job, but having to step away from my job to go do an interview with the New York Times. I have made friends, sincerely, good, deeply best friends from this effort. When you feel there's a movement out there that's backing your show, you feel validated, and you feel like, hey, we're doing something good. It was a sort of fan that I actually just wasn't really aware existed, just how invested they were in not only watching the show, but being part of a community. The fact that a group of people comes together over this shared love, and then fights so hard to hold on to what connects them, it's a remarkable, it's a remarkable force. [upbeat music] [upbeat orchestral music] These are my Cagney & Lacey books, I probably haven't looked at these since I moved to Florida, 16 years ago, in '83, I guess it was. As I started to watch Cagney & Lacey, I was living a very traditional life, marriage, kids, up until that time, you didn't have a drama show starring two women who were friends and partners at work. I am a good police officer. [Dorothy] They were real women. I know you are. [Dorothy] They didn't have to be perfect. Don't ever talk to me like that again. When I wrote my first letter to Cagney & Lacey, I chose Steve Brown, a writer, and he wrote back. This is the letter from Steve Brown, where he said that they are borderline for renewal next season, and this is from Barney, "Thanks for your terrific letter", "we are in some trouble." Dorothy was, as I remember it, was a school teacher, and was obsessed with the show. I was all for that, you know, I mean, in my own way, I was certainly obsessed with the show. Barney, to Cagney & Lacey, was the executive producer, the protector, he believed in that show, and he was always trying to bring more attention to it. [Barney] Dorothy wanted to know what else she could do, and I talked to her about writing letters, getting others to write letters, write to your local newspaper, on the theory that CBS executives may not read their mail, but they do read their newspaper. I was learning a lot from him, and I was just the person that he should be teaching, because I was ready, I was really ready. So I sort of ran my own campaign from Hillsdale, Michigan, and wrote lots of letters myself, and got my friends to do the same. In early May, the networks would decide, and he said he would be going to New York for the rollout of the new season, and that he would call me, and he did. I was in New York, waiting word, it was iffy, we were on the cusp, and Harvey called me personally, he said, "I love the show, my wife's never gonna forgive me" "for canceling it," he says, "but I'm in a business, "and I have to move on." And he said, "I don't have good news for you", "I'm sorry to tell you that we're not on the schedule." And I said, "It's not over yet." So that became a summer of really putting the pressure on. Myself, personally, you know, I can't, probably 500 myself, but I had, I had other people sign their names, and mail them. It was over the top, you know, it was... way over the top. I think that was very, very important, showing those reruns of Cagney & Lacey, because as people would read about all the fuss, they'd tune in to see what the fuss was about, and they liked what they saw. I'd cut out those ratings, and I just put them in a scrapbook, and watched it climb to number one, just little by little. We were the number one rated show in the country, because all the people who didn't watch us h us in the spring now had nothing left to watch, they're watching us, they're not gonna watch baseball. And I thought, "well, that's it, they've got to bring it back now." So I get this phone call, like at 4:10 in the afternoon, basically saying, "we have made a mistake, can you put this back together again?" One of the treasures of my life, you know, now, "we have made a mistake," says the monolith CBS. In another victory for women in television, Cagney & Lacey, the CBS series about two women cops, is back in production by popular demand, on the first day back on the set, the show stars were happy and grateful. I think it's a statement about democracy at work, it was the American public that brought us back, in their letters, and thank you. [Dorothy] I remember the night, I was in my living room, and I just flat fell down. I was just so sure it was going to happen, the force of will, it had to happen, it couldn't not happen, and it was amazing, it was phenomenal. I started the petition 'cause other shows in the past have gotten canceled, and people have started petitions for it, it, and I thought it couldn't hurt to try. When it first got put up, a lot of people were like, "Oh, you're not gonna even make it to 10,000 signatures," and then, once we got it there, I was like, okay, this is actually happening, and then it got to 15,000, and it just kept going from there, it's become a lot bigger than I thought it would, yeah. So there's a couple of core people that I've worked on a lot of the campaigns with, you know, we've become such a tight-knit group that, you know, if you're having a really bad day, they're there to cheer you up. Even if Person of Interest didn't get picked up, I'd probably stay friends with these people for the rest of my life. For the amount of time I spend trying to do this, I don't know if I should congratulate myself on how much time, or be embarrassed with how much time I'm spending online. I did get caught by my boss on my phone, she's like, "That's absolutely not okay," and I'm like, slyly put it back in my pocket, and she walks away, I get back on it again. [Laughs] Well, hopefully she never watches this. I try to keep people interactive, I try and ask them questions, like, why do you want Person of Interestto get saved, why do you like it? One lady said she was watching Person of Interest with her husband, and then her husband passed away, and she didn't want Person of Interest to get taken away from her, too. That lady saying that, I was like, wow, I'm, like, really, you know, doing something big. I'm also making people aware that past fans have done stuff, too, like even Star Trek, you know, telling them, hey, you know what, they've saved shows just by writing in letters. [woman] The internet allows us to see the level of fandom in a way that we may not have ever been able to see before, and I think it makes it easy enough to participate actively in fan communities, and I just think it reflects that increasing obviousness of the relationship between storytelling and our desire for social connection and community. [man] Probably about the time Roswellstarted, we actually got our first internet chat, you know, this was in '98, '99, so the internet really had only been around four or five years. The notion of meeting people that liked a common show, having friends that were in a different part of the country, that was really attractive. The 4400 was the only message board for a television show that I had ever been involved in, I think maybe even since, I sought out the message board because I wanted to discuss it with other fans of the show, and the community was so great, and I could be crazy with other people, they got it, they wouldn't judge me. One of the things we've seen in recent years is the use of social media, especially Twitter, while a show is on the air. I love hearing the fan reaction, on nights when my shows air, I will sit there on Twitter, and see if things worked. You go to a movie theater, and everyone's sitting there, and they're all gonna gasp, or scream, or laugh together, watching TV usually is not like that, but it's kind of this group thing on Twitter, you know, someone can say something in reaction to a big death, or a big kiss. Watching an episode live of Person of Interest, I'll tweet or post on Tumblr as it's happening, like, "Oh, my god, did you just see that happen?" A lot of the people online like you for you, you have this bond, and you just understand each other. [man] When I first heard about Chuck, I knew immediately that he was gonna be a guy like me, I'm a nerd, by nature. Please, not the computer. [Zachary Levi] He was a nerd, he loved video games, and comic books, and movies like Tron, and loved them all authentically, which was nice for me, because I had to act very little, I love all those things, too, and I think we're all looking for a lead character that we can relate to on some level. You know, Chuckwas always able to kind of just, we kept our heads above water, but we weren't ever like a ratings bonanza. You know, we weren't blowing up, it wasn't, you know, so you kind of feel like you're failing, but then you get buoyed when you would run into someone, and it's just their infectious passion. [Gray] I was in Toronto at the time, working downtown, and I've commuted a lot, lot, and so I got into podcasts, and so when Chuckcame along, I went looking for a podcast for Chuck, and I couldn't find one, and I thought, why don't I start one? [Gray] This is Gray. [Mel] This is Mel. [Liz] And I'm Liz. [Gray] And you're listening to episode one of Chuck versus the Podcast. My co-hosts on the podcasts were Mel Lowry which was the largest fan website for Chuck, and they had a very large forum on the website, people, early on, were posting, "Is Chuck gonna be renewed," "do you know anything, do you know anything?" I think we all felt creatively really good with where season two ended, and then things happened after season two behind the scenes that we didn't really know about, so we probably had a better sense of comfort than we should have had. Fans were scrambling, they wanted to do something, as we were talking about what could do, there was somebody who had a marketing background who came up with the idea of, Subway was one of their major advertisers. Chuck had had this sort of product placement, you know, moment on the show with Subway, which wasn't one of their finest moments on a story level. What can I do for you, son? Well, I had an extra chicken teriyaki foot long that I thought someone would be interested in. Do tell. I was very resigned to it, 'cause not only this product placement exists all the time, anyway, but we always knew Chuckwas a show that was struggling, so okay, let them have their gratuitous Subway moment. [Gray] She thought, why don't we tie in buying a foot long sub for the finale of Chuck, finale and a foot long, that was Wendy Farrington, and she asked us to help promote this campaign, so we did. [Wendy] Join us in the finale and a foot long activity, to participate, simply go to your local Subway, and purchase any of their $5.00 foot long sandwiches, and enjoy during the finale. [Zachary] I happen to find myself in England, doing a convention, and somebody had mentioned to me, one of the fans, they said, you know, "What are you doing for the foot long finale campaign?" I was like, "I don't know, I'm in England." And they said, "Well, you know", "there is a Subway right around the corner "from the convention center," and so I got to my panel, everybody was there, and. [upbeat music] I just "Pied Pipered" however many people came with me, and we just walked to Subway. So these are my 600 friends, and we're all gonna get sandwiches. We got there, and I think I ordered the first sandwich. He just asked me if it's all on one bill. I think we'll do separate. Then, I said, "Hey, would you mind if I came back" "behind the counter," 'cause there was so many people, "I'll help you make sandwiches." And they're like, "Yeah, go for it, love", "there's so many people," so I just jump behind the counter, and started making sandwiches. No more green peppers, I'm sorry. [crowd groans] [Woman] It's okay. Those involved in the show, you know, obviously, we want to offer whatever services we can, and this just felt like a really fun, organic way to, again, engage in the campaign, but engage with fans. And all of that kind of stuff I think showed people that there was an appetite for the show, I said it. [Zachary] I think more than anything, we all learned, and not just us at Chuck, and not just the Chuck fans, but the industry, the business, you know, ow, there was nothing negative about it, there wasn't an annoyance about it, it was patronizing a sponsor for a network television show, and to this day, I've not seen a smarter fan campaign, I haven't, I haven't. The picture over my shoulder is actually part of my two week visit to LA, when they invited me to come down to thank me for the campaign. This is the guy right here, so thank him. Yeah. And then we collectively thank you... And then thank yourself. Exactly, followed by your parents, and then the government. From there you can just... For your freedom. [Bjo] Cleveland won the bid for the World Science Fiction Convention, on, which, in their case, they called Tricon. [John] We were running the art shows, we've been doing them for about six years at that point. Our friend was going to handle a futuristic fashion show. [John] She weaseled out of it by having acute appendicitis, and said, "Here, you get to do it." So I get there, and some officious little twit said, "We have a big Hollywood producer who wants" "to put three of his costumes in your show." And I said, "Who is this," and they said, "Well, it's Gene Roddenberry," and I said, "I never heard of him," and I never heard of his show, and I said, "Absolutely not." So Gene Roddenberry showed up, and took me for coffee, and we talked, and that silver-tongued devil talked his three costumes into the fashion show. [upbeat music] So it actually went off very well, and Gene says, "Next time you're in Hollywood," "give me a call, we'll do lunch." [John] The next time we were in Hollywood, we called, and Gene picked up his phone, and said, "Come on over." So we went over, and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, it's always fun to be on a set. We saw quite a few episodes being filmed. On one occasion, we were down, and they were filming a scene from The Deadly Years. The whole feeling on the set was different than it had been before, it had been very upbeat group before, and now it kind of felt down, and just the whole tenor was different, and we couldn't get any straight answers out of any of the crew, so we did the thing you do when you want to find out what's really going on on a set, we asked craft services. And so he said, "Oh, yeah, well, word has come down" "that the show is going to be canceled" "at the end of this season." We were living in Oakland at the time, so we had to leave to go back, and we're driving up the Central Valley, somewhere over the hill in the valley, I said to her, "You know something, "we shouldn't let this happen," "there's gotta be something we can do about this." Now, I should know better than to say that to her. We spent the rest of the trip formulating a campaign. [Dorothy] Kitty, kitty, kitties! [slow music] After the Cagney & Lacey campaign, I noticed, in Mike Duffy's column, in the Detroit Free Press, he printed a letter from a woman named Donna Deen, who was trying to, in her own way, increase viewership for her favorite show, St. Elsewhere. [man] The first season of St. Elsewhere, there were only 100 television series on television, all in, three networks, 100 series. We were the 99th rated show, the lowest rated show was Cheers. Donna was the leader of the St. Elsewherecampaign, trying to [laughs] make it a hit, but we always knew it was never gonna be a hit. And I thought, well, I'm gonna drop her a note, as one television advocate to another, and we just got to sharing our thoughts on television. We came up with this idea, what if we were able to band together the viewers of all the quality shows that we were worried might be canceled by the networks. I don't really remember which of us said, "Let's call it Viewers for Quality Television," you know, we just discussed it and agreed, that, hey, that clicks. Enter, again, Barney Rosenzweig. I don't believe it's overly stating the case to say I'm the father of VQT. I wrote him about our idea, and in his annual Christmas messages to television journalists, he mentioned Donna and me, and the idea that we had. Now, we weren't ready to announce this, nothing was formed, but we both started to get mail about people who were interested in this, and before we realized it, we had a grassroots idea that was taking shape. Because I had been a Star Trek fan, and I had read the books about, you know, ow, "save Star Trek," and all that stuff, so I knew the idea of a save-a-show campaign. I had never seen a group that was organized around the notion of quality television, as opposed to organized around one specific show. Dorothy Swanson got in contact with us, as the organization was getting more organized. I was impressed by the fact that people who didn't live in LA were making noise. [Dorothy] Hillsdale, Michigan, this was a small town, my husband's friends there, I'd ask questions, like, to people, "Well, what should I do with this", "should I incorporate," they'd, "Oh, no, no, "don't bother to incorporate," they saw it as a hobby, and I was beginning to see it as a business. I heard about VQT through a column in the Washington Post by Judy Mann, and she named Dorothy Swanson, I think she had a TV appearance in the Washington area, and I met her for lunch with a couple of other people. And in talking to these people, it was kind of a different vision, it was a, well, of course, of course you need to incorporate. It was like a coven of people here that loved TV, and we just kind of got together, and talked, and wrote, and started a movement. I moved from Michigan to the Fairfax, Virginia area. There were just enough reasons to make the change, that it became easy to make the change. It just, the marriage just, well, you know, it was already kind of stale, and there were problems, he knew things were changing. [slow guitar music] [Kaily] High school was when I really started to question my sexuality, I had told a popular girl that I was in love with her, and it didn't really turn out very well. My mom wasn't very supportive, she said I shouldn't have done that, and it was, it's just a phase. You know, I ended up getting bullied about it, and I started going to school less and less. After high school, you know, that stigma of being teased in high school, and it lowering your self-esteem kind of sticks with you, and so I kind of also got bullied at work, like, in my first year of working there, people were like, "Oh, you're not gay, you just think you are." And I got used to people telling me what I could and couldn't do, and who I am. I think I got into Glee, like, in the middle of the third season. I don't really remember how I got into the whole Gleefandom online, but I just started seeing that relationship between Rachel Berry and Quinn Fabray, dubbed "faberry," and, I don't know, there was something just about it that, maybe it was their love-hate relationship, hip, they start out as enemies, and then became friends. There was a convention I went to called Faberry Con, people came from Canada, from England, Australia, a lot of people knew me because I had written a letter to Dianna Agron, thanking her for helping me with my depression, and somebody had even told me that my writing that inspired them to deal with their own depression. I went back home after, I think it was, like, four days, and I was like, I don't think I want to stay working at Walmart for the rest of my life, in a tiny little town, where nothing happens, 'cause it feels like a prison. [Acoustic guitar] Any big news? - Nothing important. - Oh. Definitely for the last year, you've been doing it for quite some time, huh? [Kaily] A year. A year, oh, okay. Oh, do you remember it? The name of the show? It's something like, you know, something interesting about people, or Person of Interest, or something like that, right? No, I knew the name of the show, I actually, you know, knew you guys were coming over last week or so, and I wanted to make sure that I at least knew that. You know, I think she said in the thousands. [Kaily] It's like 42,000... 42,000, oh, I was thinking somewhere close to 10,000, 42,000 people, so there's a lot of people that are really interested in making sure that this stays around, right? A year ago, when I got into Person of Interest, it was because of an episode called If-Then-Else that I saw on Tumblr, people make animated gif sets. There was one done of the kiss between Root and Shaw from that episode. Seeing that, I got really intrigued, and I was like, okay, there's two attractive women kissing, you don't get to see that very often on CBS. We've been known to take a peek at the Tumblr, there's definitely a... You can be a little careful with the Tumbler. - Yeah. - That's the rabbit hole. I might have broke the Tumblr with that one, but it was pretty overwhelming, when it happened. There became like this sort of newfound, it was, like, a different audience had found the show, and people were really invested in the Root-Shaw relationship, that I don't feel like had necessarily been fans of the show from season one. People seem to attach deeply to the stories that they find on television when they see their own identities reflected in those stories. Representation is a hugely important issue, there are a lot of people who grew up in America at a time when you didn't see a lot of African American characters on television, or you didn't see a lot of Latino characters on television, or you saw no gay characters on television, and I think when you see that, you really attach to that, it's very meaningful to you. This was never, like, in the plan of what this character was gonna be, it just happened that I think Sarah and I had that scene with the iron. One of the things I left out of my file, I kind of enjoy this sort of thing. Jonah was directing, and Amanda Seagal, who's one of the writers was there, and she was like, "This is the sexiest thing we've ever had on the show," and then all of a sudden, it started, like, they would make innuendos, and we just had so much fun. But it was never, like, they didn't think, like, we're casting this Shaw character to be Root's love interest, and they definitely didn't cast me thinking, like, this was what was gonna happen. We approached that relationship from a very straightforward place, and if you're looking for people on your set who have chemistry with each other, it doesn't make any difference what gender they are, or what the, you know, you're just looking for that heat. And wherever you find it, you're gonna write into that space. Queerbaiting is used as a term for when they make it seem like a same sex couple will happen, but they're just putting those hints out there to get people to watch it, and they aren't intending to actually do it. It becomes a problem when it feels like it's being used just to draw attention, and just to create interest in watching, without any genuine follow through on the emotional connection between those two characters. A lot of people are a little, like, scared to get into another show, for fear of being queerbaited, so we've been trying to tell people, watch Person of Interest, it's a genuine relationship, the writers, they're not gonna queerbait you, come watch it. [Richie] It was just a spur of the moment thing, she was sick of here living situation, and sick of her job, and probably sick of the people that she was surrounding herself with, and she said, "I'm out of here." And then he was like, "Come move back "to Sonoma and live with us," and I'm like, "Are you sure?" 'Cause I'm like, I just put six and a half years into Walmart, they're willing to take me back. I said, "Well, don't go back to the same job" "and the same people," I said, "We have a spare room here, I'll start cleaning it out." Kaily just needed to progress, well beyond where she was at then, I said, "Just stay as long as you want," you know? Now? So she's been here ever since. [man] It's a very interesting dichotomy between the fact that the shows with the biggest audiences, with the most viewership, are not the shows that have the most probably engaged, passionate fans, the ones who would do anything to save that show. Those types of shows don't necessarily suck us in all the way, they don't require as much energy to get into, and out of them. It's exactly why the network likes it, t, is the fact that, I don't have to see every episode, I can come in and out, so it's the smaller shows, you know, that can have that really passionate fan base. The more immersive the show, the better, the more we can go fully into that show's world, that seems to be particularly fertile ground for fandom. [woman] I've never been a big TV watcher, and I certainly had never been a fan of any TV show, I would never use that word associated with myself, "fandom," a concept that I don't get, it's a foreign concept to me, until Longmire. The feel, the spirituality of place, of content, of character, it was so instantly mesmerizing, is the only word to describe it. [man] As we started to do the show with A&E, E, the numbers would start trickling in, and people started coming, and we started realizing that we had ourselves a good hit. I set up a fan page for the first time, people started sending me messages, and they weren't just messages, like, "love your show," it was messages like, "My son, my husband, and", "my daughter, we get together now, and we sit down," "and we watch Longmire together as a family." But in season two, there was a dip in the ratings, and I was concerned, and I knew what to do, and that was to utilize social media, and in the effort to promote season three is when I started the Longmire Posse. Longmire Posse, actually, is my Aunt Pam, who is my dad's sister. [Pam] We always had been close, Adam and I, I always watched his career, and he always told me what was going on with his auditions, so it was such a joy and a reward to see his efforts come to fruition. I kept it private for awhile, and then it started to be pretty cool, and then other castmates were like, "This Longmire Posse is pretty cool," and, "What's this whole Longmire Posse thing?" "Somebody's reached out to me with Longmire Posse," "somebody, there's a whole posse now." And then, I think, at one point I was like, "Yeah, that's my, that's my Aunt Pam." [Pam] When Adam called me to tell me that the show had been canceled, I was not at all surprised, I knew that Longmirewasn't delivering the 18 to 35s, which is the most idyllic for advertisers, having worked in advertising all of my career. I, of course, was devastated for him, but I also knew instantly that this was gonna work out. My Aunt Pam was like, "If we can show another prospective network "that the fans are demanding that this stay," "then they're gonna hear it." [Pam] That very evening, I created the hashtag for the whole effort, called LongLiveLongmire. She was so clear right up front, and said, "Well, the goal is to make us as loud as possible," "and to keep the volume turned up." I felt a real responsibility, having started this, and knowing what needed to be done, it required momentum, I had to teach, literally teach hundreds of people how to use Twitter. Well, guess what, these bunch of old fogies rallied on social media, probably more than their own kids ever had. It was insane, I'd get on Twitter, and the feed, you know, would just, go, go, go, go, go. We had 23 consecutive weeks trending on Twitter. [Adam] We, the actors, knew that the producers were pitching to Netflix, so I knew the phone call was coming in, and I saw that it was my executive producer, Grier, calling me, and I knew, at that moment, I was either going to have to get back to the grind, and say goodbye to this family that has touched my life in ways I can barely even talk about, or we get to keep telling stories, and we get to keep doing this. And I took a deep breath, and I said, "Hi." And she said, "Netflix is picking us up." I called my aunt right away, and I think we just screamed for, like, 30 seconds, just started screaming. And of course, there was a lot of hooting and hollering going on, a lot of yahoo-ing. I don't know how she threw it together, I don't know what research she did, I don't know how she knew how to do all of this, but it worked, and everyone will forever be thankful to her for that, and I'm so proud of her. I don't want it all to be viewed as only nepotism, the thing was about Longmire, and loving the show, and celebrating the show, even though I created it for Adam. [Bjo] You'd have to be in the deepest mine on the planet to not know at least something about Star Trek nowadays. [John] "Beam me up, Scotty," is a term that anybody in our culture can understand. Star Trek has become so ubiquitous that it's, I mean, it's there, and it's a part of our culture enough that people kind of have to pay some attention. Well... We liked Star Trek because it was as true to genuine science fiction as anything on TV or film could be, we were a whole group of geeky people that regular society didn't understand, they regarded us as freaks, almost, and we were used to that. I liked it specifically because it was promising us a future in a world that did not seem to have a future. This was the era of hands over red buttons tons that could decimate the earth in nothing flat, and then all of a sudden, here comes a show that people are trying to like each other, her, and are trying to get along. We're human beings, with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. [man] I take it incredibly personally, and obviously, a lot of that is just because of who I am, and who my father was, but I genuinely, with all of my heart, believe in its message, in that future. I'll use what a fan said, "At last," "there's something that's on the TV that I want." I always try to be an optimistic person... And the show was optimistic. - Yeah. - It really was. [Dorothy] The earliest goal of VQT was communication, keeping in touch with these people who had taken the time to contact us, so that's how the newsletter came to be. Okay, so these are a variety of the newsletters, you could see, she's used all kinds of paper. The newsletter came out once a month, they would interview people from the industry, and then there would be the comments. You would go through the newsletter, and read people's comments about the shows, and why they were supporting shows, and they were often times, you know, thoughtful, they were fans, yes, but it didn't come off as fan-ish. Yes, I got the newsletter, I read, I'm not a voracious reader, but I do read stuff where, you know, I'm mentioned. Every season, and a couple times through a year, we would vote on the endorse list, and the tentative list. [Man] So there was the endorsed list, which was, like, okay, these are shows we really get behind, and then there was sort of the second tier list, which was maybe these are shows we like, but we're not 100% sure about. Being on the list, being up, you know, in the upper echelon of that world was a good thing, you needed and wanted that endorsement from them. Dorothy cared about the shows, and she cared about the shows that the members voted onto the list, you know, if NBC came and said, "Hey, VQT, what do you think about this show?" I think her response was probably, "Well, we'll see what the member say," "and then we'll tell you." [Dorothy] In the first two years, there was no campaign, we were kind of getting ourselves prepared for when it might happen, we figured it would. Julia, I didn't pick him, it just happened. And it will happen again, Suzanne, if sex were fast food, there'd be an arch over your bed. [Dorothy] This was a new kind of sitcom, it was all in the writing, and it wasn't in the situation. The funny things that these four women would say to each other, it was just so unexpected that we'd look at each other, and then go, "What was that, what did we just see?" You know, Designing Women was a different kind of show, because it was one of the first shows that actually addressed in the comedy itself issues, and besides addressing issues, the show was funny, 'cause my wife's a great writer, but sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas, they tell us we're not gonna film any more episodes after the 13th, and I remember a letter r that I'd gotten from a person named Dorothy Swanson, and so in our desperation, I called Dorothy, and we talked. I thought, well, this is, this is different, this is a producer asking me what to do, whereas before the producer had told me what I should do, and that was easy. And she said, "Well, listen, this is the best trick", "and the first trick you should learn," and it was, it was one of the greatest tricks ever, don't have people address letters to CBS, have 'em address letters to the president of CBS, Bud Grant, and it clicked in my mind, absolutely, that's what you have to do, because otherwise, all those letters were going to some warehouse, and were never really be even looked at. We said, everybody get on the phone, get your friends to write letters, and Dorothy Swanson got Viewers for Quality Television, she started them to do the same thing. I knew that we could really get a movement going here by what I was reading in the papers. And so the mail truck pulls up to CBS, and they take this giant bag of mail up to Bud Grant's office, and he said, "What the hell is this," you know, and he starts looking at 'em, and his secretaries are trying to sort 'em out, he called me, and he said, "I'm tired of this, I can't figure out who's writing me, "who's talking to me, because I'm saturated, "we have over 20,000 letters already" "from people wanting to save the show." And I said, "Well, Bud, then save the show." He said, "I can't do it." The next week, the post office had to put on extra mail trucks just to deliver the mail to his office. [Dorothy] Designing Womenwas, for us, an opportunity to do what we had formed to do. This was the first real argument that Donna Deen and I had, because she did not think we should campaign for Designing Women, because it had only reached tentative support, instead of full endorsement, I disagreed, and one thing continued to lead to another, and eventually, Donna, Donna resigned. [Pat] After Donna left, I assumed more of a vice president type, Dorothy was president of VQT, I was more the vice president. I like being second-in-command, every interview we had, Dorothy was the front person, I was back there, whispering, "Say that." And that was very helpful. The Designing Women campaign launched VQT, it was massively successful, 50,000 letters went to CBS. [Harry] Working with Viewers for Quality Television really was what saved Designing Women, I mean, there's no doubt about it, they'll always be our friends, because they did us a big favor. [Dorothy] Now, it was like we were established, and then things just happened very, very quickly. It's. It's just a TV show, but yes, it actually became much more than that. I have two children now, based on the TV show, you know, I met my wife working on these campaigns. It's not just a TV show, it's a story, it's being involved, you, I don't want to say that you feel like you're in it, like you're a part of it, but in a way, you do feel like you're a part of it. TV has a profound, long-lasting effect on people who are watching it, possibly because I come into your living room, I'm in the comfort of your own home. You didn't have to go anywhere, I'm coming to you. There is actually psychological research arch that talks about the way our experience of fiction isn't just a proxy social experience, but that it is like actual social experience, in terms of the way our brains are processing that information, yes, you can consciously know it's a story, and you can consciously know that this is television, but in terms of the actual feelings that you're getting when you're hooked into that character, they're real, they're very real for you. Certain programs I really get emotionally attached to, and it's like inviting my friends into the house once a week, I would feel very upset if they didn't come in. Now, what happens if I never see Mark again? You got canceled, that's it, I don't see you anymore, it's just the same thing with these shows. I think when people are fighting to save a show, I mean, ultimately it is still about, you know, the love of the show, and especially the love of the characters, and wanting to see their stories continue. I think underneath it, it can also be losing that sense of community, because even though the fandom will still be there, it's never gonna be the same. [Kaily] So after the season finale from season four, we heard that the episodes had been reduced to 13, and that's when I started my petition. I thought it sucked, you know, just, I mean, when you put all of this energy and time into something, and it's working, ing, if it wasn't working, that would be one thing, but when it's working. We were a little bit freaked out, just because we had decided to move our family across the country, and put our kids in school in New York, thinking this show is a good show, it has a good following, so when we found out it was 13 episodes, then it was kind of like, oh, man, that really would have changed things. There's a game they want you to play there, where you're sort of auditioning for, "okay, well", "if we come in, and we're good little soldiers, "and we play ball creatively, "and we just pump out some fucking pap for half a season, "then maybe we can squeeze out another half a season, and maybe we can become a, you know, utility player." And I was like, "you know what, fuck being a utility player." But then we didn't get an air date, and we thought, oh, well, when one of these fall shows gets canceled, they'll put us on, and they still didn't put us on, and then it was, like, mid-season replacements were announced, and we still didn't have a date. [Kaily] Fans were getting agitated, they really wanted to know the release date for Person of Interest. It got to the point in the spring where Greg and I spoke, and decided that we wanted to approach the network and say, "Look, you've got your own way of handling these things, "but at this point, it is a little borderline cruel "to the fans, we need to be straight with them," "and we keep pushing it further down the schedule." Because the concern at that point becomes, will they air the episodes? [Kaily] When I got the news that it was coming back, I was on my way to school, and then when I heard that it was getting canceled, I was on my way to class. It was probably upsetting, I know, as dorky as it sounds, kind of cried a little in my car, 'cause I didn't feel like I tried hard enough. Normally, I would come up the elevator, but our key passes have been locked out of the office, so I'm actually coming down through a back door from Westworld, down this stairwell, which I've actually never been on, to get into my old office. We had the whole floor here, the second floor, we have assistants in these cubicles, many who'd been with us from the very beginning of the show, it's, as you can see, it's pretty barren at this point. But it was great here, what we had on this wall, it was all pictures of babies, because there was all the babies that were born while the people worked on the show, and there was a lot of them, we had particularly fertile writing staff. We had, this was the wall of the dead, everyone that we killed on the show, a photo of every person, and this, of course, was our bar, which every time we would air an episode, we'd break out the bar, and live tweet, and that was a lot of fun. And I don't know what we're gonna do this year, because all the air dates will happen when there's nobody here. Yeah, this place feels eerie right now, it's kind of, it's, like, I don't want to be here now, you know, 'cause it's, it definitely drudges up a lot of hard feelings about how it ended. [slow music] [John] We're science fiction fans, we'd produced fanzines. [Bjo] We were used to mailing lists. So it was a very natural thing for us to consider a mailing campaign. [slow music] I interviewed secretaries, what kind of mail do you throw away, you answer yourself, or you put across your boss' desk? And I wrote this set of rules, based on that. [slow music] We had somebody who worked for NBC, a big Star Trek fan, and we said, "We need all of the people" "in the upper stratosphere to write to," and he gave us the names. And we asked the Tricon convention for their mailing list, and they gave it to us, which they weren't supposed to do. Then we said to Gene at one point, "Do you guys have fan mail or something we could get addresses off?" So we contacted the mail department at Paramount, and they said, "Yeah, well, you come take these 12" "or 14 bags off our hands." And then we'd gather up fans from LA, we'd start, Friday after work, people would bring their sleeping bags, then it would be an all day Saturday, and then as much Sunday as they could, before having to return home and get some rest for going to work. That's where the fans became fans. The way they wrote in, how they expressed themselves about the show, and what the show meant to them, they wanted the studio to know how important that show was. [John] A campaign lasted about two months. There was a big feeling on the part of the fans, when we were doing this, how can I help? p? We would get a whole stack of stamps in an envelope, people would just send us one or two stamps, kids would send us, you know, whatever... People would send, you know, "Here, I can give you 20 bucks." Yeah, and that's how we got it done. A great deal of conversation between us and Gene. Yeah, we called Gene to see if a letter writing campaign would be worthwhile to do, or if he'd thrown in the towel. Really, he just wanted so badly to help, and of course, NBC has always, has still thought that, you know, he was the one who instigated it. No, it was entirely us, and we were not paid by Gene, nor were we paid by the studio. We've got pictures of them dumping bags. Yeah, I've seen pictures, but I don't know that there's a number that I've ever... I have no idea, do you know? Nobody knows. Yeah, we have no idea how many letters that they got. Enough to make executives think twice. It worked. Yeah, it doesn't matter, it worked, that's the important thing, the actual results are the important thing. [Bjo] I mean, that was such an unlikely thing to happen. [Trevor] You have to wonder, if there hadn't been the Star Trek campaign, would there have been other things that have happened? But I definitely think that Star Trek'sentree into bringing this sort of political activism, or this movement to an entertainment field was the first of its kind, and very novel. [Bjo] Star Trekkept me sane in a way that I've not told many people. We had just spent several months trying g to get our oldest daughter diagnosed with whatever, that something was not working right, we knew that. For every single person who has a handicapped child, they've gone through this, at one point or another. So I had just kind of reached a point where I was going a little bit crazy, and John, bless his heart, is not a big communicator, so, you know, he was carrying his sorrow inside him. Star Trek, the whole campaign, everything, was something that kept me busy, my thoughts could be elsewhere. It made a huge difference for me, not many people know that. [Dorothy] After Designing Women, we did campaigns, it seemed like, one after the other. It almost seemed like every single show that we fell in love with immediately got in trouble. [Dorothy] Quantum Leap was a show that was moved around a bit. We were airing on Wednesdays, and that was our audience, 18 to 35. Warren Littlefield moved it to Friday night, Friday night our audience was out, they were at a bar drinking, or they were at the movies, they weren't watching television. [Dorothy] And our campaigning for that was to let it settle down in one time slot. VQT snuck in very early on, and was, you know, leading the charge with that. The fan letters came in, and I used to take these letters into Warren, dump them on his desk, say, "You've got to move us back to Wednesday." Love you, babe, let's do lunch, jerk. Recently, I've received a few letters from fans ofQuantum Leap, demanding that I move it back to its original Wednesday night time slot. Listen, I run this network, nobody tells me what to do! You know what I have to say to the fans of Quantum Leap? You win. [Announcer] By popular demand, Quantum Leap leaps back home to Wednesday on NBC. There's a great sense of community and pride, I think, that comes through the efforts of VQT, and I know that they had a lot of joy doing it, I don't think that it was, you know, drudgery, because they kept going at it. t. [man] The fact that they were perceived as successful gave them, sort of, a push that kept them going, and made it so that, oh, well, these guys saved that show, so let's see what they're gonna save next. Ext. Well, I thought, I guess they had to call it something, I don't know what I would have called it instead, but I liked the part about, "networks can't ignore," I like that, I mean, what would they have called me, the teacher? "The woman" would have been nice. [Pat] That Parade article was a boost to us in numerous ways, and an influx of funds was one way. After we realized there was money in the bank account, and that Dorothy could have her first paycheck, it was lovely to write the check, I became, now, I had a new title, I was now the treasurer. Yes, this was my job now. The deserving ones, yes. Because it was from the grassroots, it kept getting notoriety in the different press, and Dorothy was being interviewed, and she was very articulate in what people needed to do to have their voice heard. That was, that was a trip, that was, that was where I went, wow, really? That was one of my rare "wow" moments, to be associated with the word "powerful," well, yeah, I wish, you know, it was. I was always bemused by Dorothy's quote "power" in the business, I put air quotes on it, but it wasn't illusory, the networks were inordinately, disproportionately interested in what she and her group had to say, but everybody was buying into it, it seemed, and it was okay with me. It was okay with me until it wasn't. [upbeat music] We don't report on a ton of specific, on its own fan campaigns because there are so many these days, and they kind of become commonplace. I'm trying to, I can't think of the last time I wrote about a save-a-show campaign, the last big one I really remember is Jericho. [Child] Woody, what are you looking at? [dramatic music] [man] I'm a Municipal Councilor in my municipality here in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, I'm involved in basically constantly thinking about emergency management as a Municipal Councilor, we think about those things. That's probably one of the reasons why I like that post-apocalyptic genre, when I was getting into the show, I used the internet to find out more about, you know, who wrote it, and learn about the actors, and some of the backstory issues, and where it came from, and even, for that matter, to find out whether Jericho, Kansas was a real place or not, and discovered the forums. The season was doing really well, they aired the first 11 episodes, then they took us off the air for three months, but that three month hiatus just kind of really took its toll, where the fans didn't know, is the show done, where is it? Those of us who were following the ratings were getting really concerned as it was getting later in the season. The show that started out as a ratings winner, through placement mismanagement, actually became a ratings turkey, and CBS, you know, pulled the plug. You hear, "You're canceled," you get all the phone calls you're supposed to get from your agent, from the network, and everybody has all the conversations you're supposed to have, and that's supposed to be it. The online groups started organizing almost immediately. The rally point was around the blog talk radio show by Shaun Daily. [Shaun] And welcome back to the Wednesday night edition of Talking Jericho, a little off kilter a little bit, the program was officially canceled by CBS today. Shaun Daily was this just uber fan, he just loved the show, and would constantly have people on his radio station talking about Jericho. We talked about the final episode in great detail, in terms of, you know, how it was left, and how we were all left dangling, and we would never have resolution, and poor Skeet Ulrich would always be sitting on that hill with his Walkie-talkie for generations to come. Jake, I need an answer, what's it gonna be? Nuts. Which is probably the most difficult line anyone's ever had to say with sincerity, "Nuts," but yeah. I guess I did it all right. [Shaun] We gotta keep putting the pressure on CBS, sign the petitions, send your feedback in, send snail mail letters... [Jeff] I'd say we should start sending little packets of peanuts, we could send those to CBS. Yeah, the fans sending stuff in thing, I mean, it, sometimes it just feels ridiculous, but it can work, I mean, it certainly has gotten press in the past, and sometimes it can just be fun. [slow bass music] The initial campaign lasted about three months, and we sent in 6,000 bottles of Tabasco. The second time we did it, we sent in 14,000 in the first two weeks. It was funny, and sort of beautiful what they did, you know, and effective, usually effective. [slow bass music] I sent a fair share of sunflower seeds, I started out sending a few bags, and then maybe onto about four or five cases, and this is in addition to, I literally mailed them a letter every day. [slow bass music] [man] Mars bars are mostly a British candy, so I had to go to British stores, and I go up to the shopkeeper, and I say, ay, "I want to buy all your Mars bars," and she says, "Well, I need some for my customers." Yeah, we mailed chocolate bars, which, I hope they didn't melt on the way. Way. [Shaun] I tell you what, I've never had this many live listeners before, until I did these last two shows about Jericho, I mean, there's a lot of interest, because the listenership for my little program has gone through the roof. Area code 905, you're on the air, hello? Hi, Sean, Jeff Knoll here. So I speculated, and suggested, everybody go to the dollar stores, in their communities, everybody go to the dollar store, and buy a cheap pack of nuts, stick them in a padded envelope, and write it to CBS studios, stick the nuts in the bag and say, you know, "We think that canceling Jericho is nuts." I think there was an intent to do it as a gag, and then they met a nut distributor, and then everything just went crazy. [Jeff] My name is Jeff Braverman, We started getting a few orders that looked really weird, I just quickly looked on the internet, Googled what was going on, and quickly realized there was something going on about a TV show called Jericho. I posted somewhere, maybe it was on some forum or message board, saying, "Hey," you know, now, "We got great nuts," and, you know, "We could ship them to CBS" type of a thing. Let's a build a page where people contribute money where we can then send out cases. Then I did, and then after that, things kind of went nuts. We shipped two tons on Tuesday, two tons yesterday, and it looks like we have another two tons to go out today. We started getting hundreds and thousands of dollars contributed towards nuts, and the pounds of nuts were just going up and up and up. We've got 9, 18, 20, so it's probably close to the equivalent of all, everything you're seeing here. - What? - Get out, really? 50,000 pounds, so 25 tons, that's crazy. [Shaun] Hello? [Carole] Hello? [Shaun] Hi, Carole Barbee. [Carole] Hey, guys, I'm so amazed at what this group of fans, and particularly you, have pulled off, it started right here with the whole nuts thing, and it's amazing. I think I expected something to happen, but I wasn't fully expecting that, like, I assumed that at some point, they would find a way out of it, short of, you know, full capitulation. It's such a, you know, badge of honor r that a story you're telling will affect people in such a way that they will go to those lengths. We managed to convince a Fortune 500 company, a massive corporation, CBS, to actually change a decision, this was thrilling, fascinating, exhilarating, and, frankly, a miracle. [laughs] [Kaily] When the fifth season of Person of Intereststarted, it was very, like, exciting time, you know, everybody of all parts of the fandom were just excited that this show was just finally back. When Root and Shaw finally reunited. [Shaw] Root? Shaw. Even though it was just one part of the Person of Interest fandom, people, they were a lot more enthusiastic tic about jumping on board, and trying to help save the show. As gratified and excited as we are that that relationship speaks to people, we have to maintain a bit of a distance on it, in terms of continuing to be able to write it the way that always felt it should be written, so that it doesn't feel like we're trying to be manipulative, or exploitative, or any of those sorts of things, you just write in the direction we always wrote, which, sadly, this season is gonna piss a lot of people off. [man] On The 100, they had this character, Lexa, who was introduced in the second season, they started to build up a relationship between her and the main character on the show, which this is very significant, because the main female hero on the CW sci-fi action show, they reveal is bisexual, there was a lot to admire about the way they were doing this, and then she was killed off. [gun fires] [Clarke] Lexa. She was killed off in a way that a lot of people, myself included, didn't feel was satisfying dramatically for the character, but also it spoke to larger issues, there was a lot of people who were very upset about this, saying that it was a sort of prime example of the dead lesbian trope. The dead lesbian trope has to do with the frequency with which LGBTQ characters are killed off in proportion to straight characters. When you look, it's just the sheer numbers who end up being killed, you see this disproportionate killing off of gay characters. Despite the pain, and the anger, and the resentment over the last few months of characters being killed off, the one good thing is that we're having this conversation now, and we didn't have it before. Now there are billboards up in this town, saying LGBT characters and the community deserve better. [slow ambient rhythm] - No! - [gun fires] [gun fires] [slow ambient rhythm] [Kaily] I know a show is more than one character, but for me, 'cause I got into the show for these two female characters, when half of the reason you're watching the show goes away, you know, so does the enthusiasm for watching it. [man] With Person of Interest, there was so much hope that especially after The 100, and all those other shows, they said, "oh, maybe, maybe Root and Shaw make it to the end, maybe this will be the couple that we can say they, were this kick ass action show couple, and they both made it to the end, and they can have a happy ending", and then when it didn't happen, I think there was just a lot of people that were sad about that. I think when your representation is still pretty slim to begin with, that's what makes it very notable. [Kaily] I wasn't eating very well after it happened, I wasn't sleeping very well after it happened, you know, I probably cried for a week, it was like an actual friend dying. [Jonathan] When it comes to the relationship with Root and Shaw, where you have to be very careful there, is that you wind up second guessing yourself, because you're trying to be sensitive to the, to, you know, to the particular community that is connecting with those characters. Where that's tricky for us this season is we have long planned for one of those characters to be killed off of the show, and we've stuck to our guns with that story decision. [Kaily] I know that it's their story to tell, but the characters Root and Shaw weren't ever supposed to be a couple, but they saw that, and they made it happen, and the characters have evolved so much that with their character growth, why couldn't the writers have grown with that, and changed their idea from their original idea of, you know, killing off this character that had so much growth. I think you need to be sensitive to things that, playing on certain stereotypes, or playing on tropes that are out there, but if you try to design a show you would have no fucking show. Like, you know, it's, you know, you want to avoid cliche, you want to write something fresh and original, and frankly, when you're writing TV, there's no time to watch TV, so sometimes you miss some of the things that are happening out there. None of these shows, there was no collusion, you know, there was no, like, grand scheme, but by them all happening so close together, I think it kind of put a light on something that, you know, no one was maliciously trying to do, but they all ended up feeding into, and I think now, of course, there's, no one's gonna go forward not thinking about this. At this point, I'm like, I don't care what any of you think, I watch it for Root and Shaw, and if they're not both in it, I don't care about saving it. So. Anyway, these are just, I realize, there's just all of these pictures, and I, at one point, I had them in the order by year. I went to the very first VQT convention, it was in Fairfax, Virginia, it was held in a hotel suite, that's how small it was. So that was the first convention, there were probably about 40 of us there, and then we decide, okay, we know what we're doing now, so we can go to the West Coast. That was quite an undertaking, it was a risk, it was expensive, but it was the right way to do it. The first night, we would hold a meet and greet, which was quite informal. You know, cheese and crackers, and soda, I think we might have paid for a bartender, and the celebrities just came, talking to everybody, taking pictures, having cheese. Linda Thomason said, "Why wouldn't we come?" "Everybody walks around telling us how wonderful we are." We wanted, of course, part of it to be educational, so Saturday, it was panel discussions. I would invite writers, producers, actors, and even sometimes network executives. Dorothy, let's talk about, and I know it's maybe a dirty word to this group, but money, let's talk about dollars and cents. [Dorothy] We do understand that. I know, but, you know, you've given me a lot of grief, and I can say this, over easy streets, you have. I did, I spoke, I was keynote speaker at many of them. Here's when quality television panels were intimate, that's what made it great, and I'm sure it's what made Viewers for Quality Television grow so quickly, too. And then the culmination was Saturday night, and that would be the awards banquet. [Pam] The awards ceremony that we had was the highlight of the weekend, it was an amazing event, because almost every award winner came. This was the era before you had to go through publicists, before you had to do lots of, it was a more innocent time. I think the Q awards, where they did get celebrities to come in and accept these awards, there wasn't really anything like it before that, I'm sure that the celebrities, at first, were like, "What?" [Scott Bakula] It was a celebration of television, and good things in television, and pushing for more, that was a nice thing to be associated with, and a great stamp for the show to have on it, and it really carried a lot of weight back then. Dorothy was a school teacher, so the celebrities had to line up, and I remember standing next to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and she was doubled over laughing, she said, "I haven't had to stand "in line like this since kindergarten."" I said, "Dorothy's a teacher," she said, "Okay, I'll get in line." They played along, they came to have a good time, and they came to be a person again. [man] If you've never seen a Viewers for Quality Television award, we have two here, one was for best series for Homicide, and one was the founder's award, which I think was the award they gave when Dorothy decided you deserved an award, but you didn't get enough votes. They're lovely, very proud to have them. The people who received our awards, a lot of them say that these mean more to them because they're given by the viewers. One, on a personal note, last year, I didn't attend, because I was at the Betty Ford Center, and a week after this event, Peter Casey came to visit me, and brought me this, and it meant a world to me, that you had shown me, still, such affection and kindness, and it helped me through a very difficult time, and I thank you for that deeply. It was pure, and that's a rarity, it was a rarity then, and it certainly would be a rarity now. It was, we were filled with terror, like sheep being led to the slaughter, we just couldn't, we couldn't believe we were doing this again. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it was a responsibility, too. It was a lot of fun when it was over, we would have a staff party, and just laugh, and laugh, and laugh, everybody had a story to tell, that was the fun part, when it was over, and we survived another one, that was fun. [Laughs] [gulls cry] This is the ticket for the red carpet Hollywood premiere of the Veronica Marsmovie. [man] We were probably halfway into our third season when the network executives suggested that I move toward a conclusion that season that wrapped things up tidily. I made a decision that I was not going to wrap it up tidily, I didn't want our fans to be satisfied with an ending, I wanted them working on our behalf. You know, within a couple years, we were thinking, could we make a movie, is there any world where that could happen, and I developed a pitch. Rob had been exploring the idea of doing something with Veronica Mars, making a movie, and he had been going around to folks that he knew at Warner Brothers, but the studio did not have the financial incentive to make this movie, ever. Because Warner Brothers owned it, it wasn't like I could go sell a version of it to some small indie studio who might make it. It took a few years, and then Kickstarter came into being. The first I'd ever heard about Kickstarter was when one of the musicians who I knew and was friendly with launched a Kickstarter drive, and he kind of showed me how it worked. I did start doing cocktail napkin math, and I kept thinking, well, what is the minimum we need to make a decent Veronica Mars movie? The biggest hurdle was convincing Warner Brothers to let us do that. Many of the folks across the studio didn't really understand Kickstarter, or what that meant. Kristen Bell, and Jason Dohring, and Enrico Colantoni, Ryan Hansen, we all got together and shot the intro movie for a potential Kickstarter project. Okay, boys, we all want to make the movie, the question is, how? I think we should ask Rob. I don't know, he's been pretty useless on this front. No, I think Ryan's right, we should, Rob'll know what to do. Fine, any suggestions, Rob? Well, actually, I do have a few ideas, I say we have the fans fund the movie. The one place where that video went viral was within the halls of Warner Brothers. Having that video kind of bounce around the studio actually really helped with some of the senior executives. It put them in the shoes of the fans, right, and I think they even started to feel excited about it, and could see how this could work. One morning, I get an email from a fellow Veronica Mars fan, and said, "Did you see the Kickstarter campaign?" All right, here, I'm hitting launch, we are live, we are live. Certainly, there was plenty of fear that we would launch and no one would care. I was the skeptic, man, I'm the old guy who, you know, who barely knows about the internet, I didn't know what the fuck Kickstarter was. And I wasn't alone in my skepticism, I was like, "We're asking for two million dollars," I was like, what? We were basing it, or Rob certainly was basing it on the rumor that people wanted to see the movie. I was reasonable confident, it was still terrifying when we launched, and yet, I never in my wildest dreams thought it would take off like it did. Kristen, the next update is gonna take us over one million... [Kristen] Oh, my gosh! One million, one thousand dollars [Kristen] Oh, my gosh, that's so, I'm so happy right now. By midday, it was becoming clear that we might hit our goal in one day. But this is the biggie, this is, you know, a million was nice, but two million was our goal, so when this clicks over, we are a green lit movie, we are making this movie. Oh, look at that, yes! Two million, we are green lit. I was just like, yeah, this thing is actually gonna happen now. I do take a lot of personal pride in sort of the initiative, we made the cover of Entertainment Weekly, not because the size of our movie warranted it, but because it was a newfangled way of getting a movie made. I decided to contribute at the $750.00 level, I got a ticket for the screening, and I actually got a selfie with Kristen on the red carpet. That was probably, you know, one of the best nights of my life, that was definitely really up there. [Peaceful strings] [Bjo] We're members of the Society for Creative Anachronism, known as the SCA. We are re-enacting the early medieval times, it's something we enjoy very much, it's existed almost as long as Star Trek... Actually longer than Star Trek. Yeah, actually, yeah, by several weeks. A lot of people feel very dispossessed of their immediate family, and actually feel much closer, in fact, to some of the people they have met and have learned to love, in both Star Trek fandom, and the SCA. Okay, time for tea. You know, Star Trek wasn't the only campaign we did, a couple of people somewhere on the East Coast wanted to start a campaign to get the first space shuttle named Enterprise, but they had no idea how to do it, so they contacted us, and said, "Here, you do it." [Bjo] And just dumped all this stuff on us and left. So we started a little letter writing campaign, the same way we done the original one, and told people to write to Gerald Ford. So they got a bunch of letters in, and apparently, when NASA went to Ford, and said they were gonna be doing a rollout of the space shuttle Constitution, Gerald Ford said, "Well, you know, I rather fancy the name Enterprise," "let's name her that." [slow music] [Bjo] Now, the rollout of the Enterprise shuttle was a press event, so they invited Gene, and all the actors. Absolutely incredible, we got to go on, on, you know, I went straight to my station, what I wanted to be my station. [laughs] It was a thrill for us, and for the producer, creator, Gene Roddenberry. When that space shuttle rolled out, his chest just swelled. People kept saying, "Well, you know", "why did you do this," you know, the Star Trek thing. I said, "You know what, it wasn't Star Trek at all." "What it was was to get people excited" "about the space program." Oh, my. I don't know if I can. [slow piano music] ♪ Living in time ♪ ♪ And feeling every moment ♪ The show was mine, I say mine in the fullest sense of the term, there was no other financial backer, I put up the money myself, I mortgaged my house, and I had nobody to answer to. Sharon and I were the darlings of the press, it was a romantic story, we fell in love on the show, we announced our engagement to the crew, it was all kind of a Cinderella story. In the middle of this, of course, there's Dorothy Swanson, shows up, always can count on Dorothy, you know, my Pinocchio. Okay, start over, there were times when producers who had, who had just really, we had become close with, I mean, their first show just really was super quality, and had our highest endorsement, and we didn't realize that the expectation existed that we would also love the next one. I think the expectation became, as the years went on, that every Barney Rosenzweig show and Sharon Gless show would be ours, because we were fans. There was fallout when we didn't just put fan letters in, we printed some letters that were, they were more critical than normal, and I'm not just picking on Rosie O'Neill, ill, there were other shows, we were so connected to the Thomasons, I mean, they put us on the map with Designing Women, but when we didn't like Hearts of Fire, not that we didn't say nice things, it was like a critique from members of, "We wish it could be better, because." And Designing Women, yeah. Yeah. See, I had a choice, I could, I, editorially, chose to print those negative comments, 'cause I thought it might help. And maybe I was wrong, 'cause that's not what they wanted to hear, but probably today, all these years later, maybe they don't even remember. I don't. I'm sure one does. Yeah, yes. I put loyalty up real high on certain lists, not everybody has to be loyal to me forever, you know, but Dorothy Swanson does, you know, I made her what she was. You never, ever again can do anything but say nice things about me and mine, that's just the way it is, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it, anything. Well, I must tell you, also, you have to understand that when we were doing Designing Women and other shows right in that era, we had three on the air at one time, that we were very young, and what we thought was criticism then, after we got involved in politics with our friend, Bill Clinton, we now understand, that was no criticism at all. It was painful, we had grown up with those people, and we respected them, and cared about them, but we had to keep true to what VQT's vision was. Viewers for Quality Television, and Dorothy in particular, was concerned with keeping the integrity of VQT intact. So, you know, I understand how that became less fun over time, but I think if she hadn't done that, then I think it would have become less fun in a whole lot of other ways. Journalists would have stopped calling, TV critics wouldn't have written about them, wouldn't have taken them as seriously if they hadn't had that integrity. Yeah, this was hard, because, you know, Sharon's right here in Florida, I mean, I let that go. I'm sure that Dorothy Swanson regrets ever saying anything negative about me, or Sharon Gless, or our work, there's no doubt in my mind, because it didn't do well for her to do so. We both just said, "Okay, see you later," you know? You know, I can't tell you what I thought at the time, but now, as an adult, looking back on it, yeah, she should have printed the criticisms, and if we didn't take it well, we should have taken it better. I hadn't thought about it in, what, what has it been, 25, 30 years? Surprised to hear she's alive, and living in Florida, I hope our paths do not cross, I just think it was stupid, I can forgive a lot of things, stupidity is hard to forgive. I know that it was worth it, because... of the respect the organization still seems to have today. Sure, there are some things I might have done differently, more diplomatically, more tactfully, with less arrogance, but yes, it was worth it. [slow piano music] [Pam] After the disconnect with Barney and with the Thomasons, VQT was also reaching a point where, first of all, that was hard, and secondly, times were changing very, very quickly. People started doing internet campaigns, and emailing, posting things online to get support, and our membership was dwindling. When Dorothy couldn't get through to anybody, she had to go through the publicist. We knew that our time of being the "aw, shucks", "this is great, we're gonna have everybody come to dinner," was over, we had had our day in the sun, and we weren't going to just continue to pretend that we were making a difference. So, that was, that was it. 15 years, 16? It was, it was long enough. It was enjoyable, I am glad I belonged to the group, and it gave me a voice, and I knew that the bigwigs were reading what I wrote, so this little peon in Philadelphia had the ears of the network presidents. TV viewing can be a really, really dangerously isolating experience, and VQT helped me avoid that whole thing. It's really lovely to reminisce, it's just like a high school reunion, going back, and saying, wow, we were pretty cool back then. [slow orchestral music] [Scott Bakula] I do give them tremendous credit for being a solid voice in the wilderness, saying, if it's better, we're gonna say we like it, it's better, it's smarter, think about what TV takes on now regularly, on a regular basis, and that's incorporated into the fabric and the tapestry of television. It started back then, and VQT was definitely a part of that. [Dorothy] It was a road less taken, nobody really walked that particular road before, and somebody wrote, "If you're going to take the road less taken," "just leave footprints," and I believe I did leave footprints. [slow music] [Kaily] I graduated high school in 2006, then January, I enrolled in the college. You know, I guess I'm a late bloomer. On a film shoot, the only people who are working all the time. [Kaily] My brother giving me the opportunity to come back here, and you know, just clean slate, starting over, not many people get that. I'm definitely grateful for it. [slow music] With all the campaigns we've done, some people were like, "Well, you shouldn't give up," "'cause, you know, so many people put their time into it." And one of my co-workers, she knew how much Root and Shaw meant to me, but she's like, "You know, I still think you should keep going" "with trying to save the show." So she kind of helped motivate me, too, to keep still trying, if I stay persistent and positive, I'm hoping definitely that we'll succeed in something. Three years ago, if I had, like, ran into the show, I would probably have not even tried to do this, 'cause I gave up on a lot of things. [slow music] My trying to save Person of Interest and fighting so hard is kind of, in a way, also trying to prove to myself that I can do a lot more than I thought I could. The fact that it's gotten so far, it's kind of actually boosted my self-esteem, people are like, you know, "You're the voice for us." It's been a long journey going from somebody that didn't believe in themselves, and gave up all the time, you know, even almost, you know, on life, to somebody that wants to live life to the fullest, and not have any regrets. Oh, my goodness, this is the original, early letter, my gosh, oh, come on, you. What? It hasn't, it's gone very large now, there we go. - That, come on. - Stay. Sit, stay, all right, ready? "Action now is of the essence," "I just got a call from Gene Roddenberry." "It is highly likely that Star Trek will die" "if something isn't done, we don't have much time to work." "Martin Werner, head of programming for NBC TV, "Rockefeller Center, New York, is one "of the main people who will decide whether" "or not Star Trek lives." "Letters should be personally addressed "to him, we want to combat the good old traditional American" "attitude of, well, my one vote doesn't count much." "Because your one tiny letter may be the letter "that topples the scales in the right directions." "If thousands of fans." "Just sat around, moaning about the death of Star Trek," "they will get exactly what they deserve, Gomer Pyle, yuck." "But if thousands of fans get off their big," "fat pipers and write letters, and do it soon, like now." "It could happen that the man in charge "of this sort of thing will be more impressed" "with our letters than with the damn Nielsen ratings." "So pass the word, and write some letters," "people, it's up to us fans to keep Star Trek on TV." "Our own inaction will assure" "that it never sees a third season."
