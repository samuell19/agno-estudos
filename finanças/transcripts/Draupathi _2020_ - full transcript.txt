If we want to win, we have to post the atrocities happened to them in the media and reveal the world by tonight Let's think how to implement it We have taken a documentary Shall we release it? What documentary is it? What is it about? We have done a documentary on how Draupathi and Lakshmi were affected, by this fake marriage certificate If it's released, there are chances for a big revolution among the people Excellent, mam If a revolution is created by this and if any of the victims of their parents, approach the court, then I'll take care of the rest Release the documentary on prime time We must get the judgement by the time the child is born Greetings to all! Welcome to 'Urimai Kural'(Voice of rights) programme In this programme, the topic we are going to discuss is about a documentary That too, it has been released on social websites, especially on You tube, it has created controversies, and debates equal to a big feature film The title of that documentary is, 'Draupathi's vow' Today, we are going to discuss about it 'Draupathi' The concept of the documentary which is adapted from the real incident is very shocking In Senthamangalam village, Villupuram District, A beverage company, in order to establish their plant, visits that village But, the village head is reprimanding them and not allowing them to set the plant But, they approach a 'movement' after outsted from there That 'movement' implements a plan That was perceived as a shocking plan They try to make the daughter of the village head to fall in love with the guy they had sent When it's not happening, as their next step In the Sub-registrar office, Royapuram, They conducted a fake marriage without the presence of the girl and give the marriage certificate to the village head The village head commits suicide out of shock This is the content of that film An important matter of the film is, the fake marriage that happened without the girl Lawyer Gurudevan, who is bonded to controversies, takes this as a public case to the High court The judgement of this case will be given tomorrow Before that, he had made two requests Let's watch it now If a clan is doing so many fake marriages and sexual harassments very boldly means, what would be the reason? As an attempt to prevent fake marriages, You've taken a documentary, 'Draupathi's vow' First, I congratulate you and your team for that effort Thank you, sir According to me, many women, either who have done register marriages or sexual harassment cases, if they need a permanent solution they must come out and speak boldly Only then, we will get a solution for these problems Sir, what's the amendment that you've requested in your public interest writ? The CCTV cameras must be fitted in all the locations where marriage registrations take place The event should be recorded That should be protected by the Government archives And this kind of marriages should happen in the presence of parents That too, when the girls are below 21 years of age, their marriage should happen definitely in presence of her parents I've put forward these two requests There are many girls who are affected like Lakshmi Either the victims of their parents, when they approach with proper evidence, I believe definitely there will be an amendment of law The important message revealed by this documentary is Though we say there is no caste or if we deny caste, casteism will not be abolished When said the caste exists, we can travel in par Only when we travel so, we can get rid of the political businessmen from this society It has been conveyed strongly by this film The verdict to be given tomorrow is creating an expectation of the changes in the Indian Hindu Marriage Act We are anticipating like you all for the verdict Let's meet again in the next programme Thank you, bye Sir, he is Jackdoss Hey, say in the court tomorrow that you've done all these for Prabhakar - Okay? - Okay, sir Dude, don't blabber that you've done this for sake of money Nothing like that, sir - Take care - I'm leaving, sir Inquiry on public welfare petition of fake registration marriage Item No16 Petitioner Gurudevan My Lordship!

Truth alone triumphs, my lordship Based on the evidence given by the police department, I've argued on this case I don't have any queries against this video I admit myself Thank you, my lordship Justice will prevail At present, in the Hindu Marriage Registration process, …based on these incidents, it's clear there are many loopholes In Tamil Nadu, at the Chief Secretary office, Chennai Just at one Sub-Registrar office, 3500 fake marriages have been registered So, on the whole at Municipalities, Corporations and Panchayats… …how many fake marriages like these would've been done? It's against the Indian Constitution law, clause 21 The Constitution of India provides security for the citizens and their lives But, because of the fake marriages by these anti-socials, it poses biggest threat to the security The Government should intervene and stop this, immediately The law should be amended with new conditions and I request to order, to transfer this case to the CBI As per the Hindu Marriage Act, Section 5 this marriage must be annulled Moreover, I plead to make it as a paradigm case, my lordship Prabhakaran, who tried to bring this case to the High court where the police has registered a fake case on him and kept him under arrest The case number 216, the twin murders which happened at 2018, was investigated thoroughly and the confessions got from the witnesses is in this hard disk, your honour It's for your perusal Using such fake marriages as weapons, no one should be affected, henceforth And to ensure the whole community lives in peace I request you to give a historical judgement, my lordship The judgement of this case will be announced after 30 minutes Prabhakar, don't worry We got best doctors with us Everything will be good Thank you, doctor We have to take her to surgical theatre in two minutes I didn't believe when you said Our thoughts are more powerful We can make the whole world to understand a thing from where we are I can understand it now, dear Do you know how many people are crying for you? I believe you can heed me I believe you will call me again fondly as, 'dear' Go boldly, dear Dude, don't worry Our deity will take care of Draupathi In order to eliminate the flaws in the fake register marriages, When hearing this petition, it was a great shock to the High court In India, we all are living around the culture of marriage It's clearly understood, there is a threat to individual human rights and security Since, it's obvious that the register marriages are beneficial to many men and adverse to many women, So, as per the provisions in section 5, The court condemns the Public prosecutor, the Police department and the Registrar office who tried to hide it As per article 21, it's the duty of the Government to protect the rights of the people In that, there is clearly a transgression, Since more than 3000 fake marriages were registered, We order to transfer this case to CBI and to submit the investigation report in two months Moreover, the Sub- Registrar, Mr Neela Narayanan who accepted his faults, will be detained from his job, And this High court directs to confiscate his immovable properties bought during his job tenure and hand over to the 'Disaster relief fund' In this case, Prabhakar is being accused falsely and since another case has been linked, we recommend that these documents be sent to Villupuram court where the case is being held From today, according to Tamil Nadu Marriage Act 2009, All register marriages should happen in the presence of CCTV cameras where the face of male and female registrars should be recorded The CCTV record evidence should be protected in the Government digital archive In the event of confusion, it can be probed as an evidence Henceforth, without CCTV cameras, the register marriages shouldn't take place From today, the High court enacts it as a law Another request of demanding that the register marriage should happen in the presence of parents is the registrar's wish and it cannot be made as law In India, all are equal Everyone has the right to choose their married life Therefore, the High court declares the enacted law should be implemented, immediately Thank you, your lordship Yes, we got the judgement Henceforth, the register marriages will not happen without CCTV cameras Good, Prabhakaran It happened as your wife's intention Dude! It's a baby girl, Prabhakar She is like our goddess! Yes, dude "My little Draupath!"
