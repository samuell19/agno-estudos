Hey there, my favorites. Anyway, today is my first day of university, and I'm so excited. Of course, I'm going to bring my baby with me. But before that, I'd like to thank O'Boutique Hotel for sponsoring me and my sister's stay here last night. Look at this. It's pretty, isn't it? It's convenient and affordable too. You won't find any other. Okay, I got to go. See you later. Peace be upon you. Kisses! Lucky you, you're Instafamous. Everything's sponsored. - Yes. I understand. - I have to settle the kids' stuff. Just go ahead and settle your family affairs. - All right. - Uda and I are here. Next time then. Send my regards to Ina and the kids. God willing. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. What's our brother's excuse this time? Come on, just let it go. Hey, this little sister of his is his responsibility too. Look at her. - Would it kill her to not act so girly? - Today is my first day of university, and I brought my baby. Wish me luck. Bye. Hey, can't you ride in the car with us like a sane human being? No way. I promised my followers that I would ride to university on my first day. That means, if she wanted to eat, sprained something, or even farted, she would have to inform her followers, is that it? Was it not because of me that a certain someone got to sleep so soundly in a hotel for free last night? - That's too much! What's your problem? - All right, that's it. Stop it, both of you. Yaya, go ahead and register first and let us know once you've got your room number. We'll send your stuff to your room. After that, we'll head straight home, won't we? Have you forgotten that we're taking Mom to her friend's wedding? Take good care of yourself. You're on your own now, and far away too. This place is not that far. It's only Malacca and Kuala Lumpur. Hey, listen to your sister. Study hard, and don't be a burden to Mom. Yes, I know. Let's go ahead and shoot. We don't have to wait for Mateen. Serves him right for coming late. Okay. Plus, if we are going to run the Campus Bulletin, we must work hard and be disciplined. Good looks alone aren't enough. Whatever you say. Hi. Yaya, right? Yes. I'm Hakim from the Campus Bulletin. I'm sure you've heard about me. Anyway, can I interview you? Yes, sure. Yaya. Excuse me. Did you post this? Just so you know, it didn't seem like you were lining up. So technically, I didn't cut in line. Okay, don't worry. Anyway, where were we? Did you say anything? My question for you is why did you have to tweet that? Delete it now. Why? Because what you tweeted was wrong. It's not wrong at all. I mean, cutting in line is wrong. But I didn't cut in line. But I've already got 200 retweets. I can't delete it now. What will they say? Plus, it sends a good message to the public. A good message? Oh, I see. You do you realize that posting a picture of me without my permission is wrong, don't you? It's all right. Everyone makes mistakes. It's a small matter. Are you for real? Seriously? Touching me like that? You better delete that tweet, or I'll take that phone and shove it down your throat! Hey, take it easy. She already said she's forgiven you. Was I talking to you? Is your name Yaya? Hello. I'm her friend. - Guys, it's okay. - What's your problem? - Don't worry. - I'm not finished yet. Next, please. - Okay. I'll let you go first. - Next, please. - It's okay. Please go first. - Oh, my God. I'm letting you go first. Yaya, you're too nice. - I'm your biggest fan. - Oh, my God. I'm such a huge fan. Really? - How about we go... - Hi. The highly popular Yaya. Sorry. I forgot about us. Where were we? I'm from the Campus Bulletin. All right, I know this is the female hostel, but I'm just here for some journalism work, okay? And no, we're not recording that kind of video. We interview all the female students on their first day of registration. I mean, not just the girls. We interview both genders, actually. I got it. We interview all existing genders. But, you know, some people think there are more than two genders. And I'm okay with that. Yes! I made it in two minutes. Yes. Guys, new record. I climbed 120 steps in two minutes. Yes! Okay, bye! - This is your room? - This is your room? - This is my room! - This is my room! This is Mateen. I'm now at the Cempaka hostel with our "fussy" facilitator, Kak Liza. So, Kak Liza, how's the first day so far? Is everything going smoothly? Please don't call me "Kak Liza". We're the same age. Just play along. Fine. Okay, today we have... Excuse me. What's your name? - Can you help me out? - Yes? What's the procedure like if we want to change rooms? Why? I don't think we're compatible as roommates. And I don't think we'll ever be. So you wanna change rooms? Not a problem at all. We're definitely here to provide you a 7-star hotel service, complete with flowers on your bed, fluffy pillows, bathrobes in the bathroom. What else do you need? You don't have to be so sarcastic. We were just asking. Address me properly. It's Kak Liza to you! I don't think so. I think we're both the same age. I'm a mature student. Mature? Listen here. If you're so mature, a small matter like this shouldn't be an issue. Deal with it on your own, like adults. It's okay, Kak Liza. I totally understand we can't change rooms. - Good. - We're so sorry to bother you. Oh, one more thing Kak Liza. That shawl looks hideous with that outfit. What style is that, Rasta? No fussy, no cry - That's the first day of registration... - Shut that thing off. I knew it. Those girls have potential. They're viral material. We need to follow them. - Okay. - All right, let's go. Go, Yaya. Are you done unpacking? What do you care? Yes, of course I care. It's my room too. As if it's my lifelong dream to be roommates with you. What's your problem? I'll make it simple. Let's just pretend we don't exist to each other. You do your thing, and I'll do mine. There. Now, stop talking to me. But this room's still a mess. We just can't leave it... Hang on. Why am I hearing voices? I thought I was the only one in the room. Get up! Get up! Quickly now. How's your 7-star hotel stay so far? Get up! The Prophet does not acknowledge children who disobey their parents. As Muslims, we have to be respectful toward our parents. We can't make them angry or sad. Mom! That's an example of an ungrateful child. Sorry. We need to realize the sacrifices of our parents, from money and energy, to raise us. Why didn't you wake me up? What? Why do I hear voices? I wonder who that could be. Because of you, I now have a week's worth of chores to do. That's not my problem. It's okay. I can make it your problem. Pay attention. Their unconditional sacrifice... What are you going to do? We should be grateful for the gift of parents. They have... You sure are brave, leaving your precious bicycle all alone. Totally unattended. What are you going do? Well, I don't know. Should anything happen to that bicycle of yours, will your sponsor get you a new one? Don't you dare touch my baby. Hey. Hey, I'm talking to... Pay attention. I'm talking to you. Quiet. Pay attention. Looks like someone was never taught any manners by their mother. Don't drag my mother into this. So your mother really did not teach you any manners. Stop it, Yaya. Your mother must be ashamed of you. You're not just unkempt. You're unruly too. Get that on camera. Stop it! Why should I? You stop it! Make sure you get this. Why should I stop? I did ask you to stop first, didn't I? - Fine then. - Ouch! - Stop! - Oh, my God. What's going on here? - This is the Campus Bulletin. - Hot news. A cat fight occurred inside the university's prayer hall last night. Now, we can't show you their identities to protect their privacy. But if you read the comments below, you can pretty much tell who they are. And not only has this video gone viral in our campus, the whole of Malaysia has seen it too, Mateen. But, you know, we mustn't believe everything in the comment section because rumor has it, these girls are fighting over a guy. That's not the real story at all, right, Hakim? Yes, but how can we know? Why else would girls fight? Anyway, we hope that the issue gets resolved in the best way possible. That's right, Mateen. It seems like they've been called to the dean's office. I wonder what will happen to them. Maybe they'll be expelled. Who knows? - Okay. Miss Zakiah. - Yes? Not you. I meant her. I've tried contacting your mom in New York through WhatsApp, but she did not respond. My WhatsApp has only one tick. Surprise, surprise. Speaking of WhatsApp messages, have you heard? Some students' parents have started a WhatsApp group, and I have to answer all of their questions about this incident. Would you like me to read some of those messages? Listen closely. "Why were they fighting in the prayer hall?" "Were there no lecturers around?" "What if those girls were juveniles who've had brushes with the police?" I've never had a brush with the police. Yaya. Here's another one. "Why must my daughter wake up at 3 in the morning for orientation?" "You'll be hearing from my lawyer!" Yes. Since you two started the incident, you two must be dealt with. I really hope you'll reconsider this case. Our family cannot afford to pay for her studies, so we really appreciate this opportunity. Mrs. Hasnah, Yaya is a scholarship student. She's supposed to be a role model and make the college proud instead of getting into petty fights. I completely agree. She won't cause trouble anymore. - And Miss Zakiah. - Yes? Again, I meant her. Based on your record, this is not your first college, is it? What happened at your last college? You failed your practical course in the final semester. It's not my fault. The external examiner disliked me, and I wasn't interested in the course anyway. I understand all too well that your mother can afford you changing colleges. I never said that. Well, that's not how it works here. I'm setting up some ground rules. If you misbehave again, I will have you expelled from this college. So, if you two still want to stay, you have to do some damage control. You need to do some charity work. - Yeah, sure. - I can do that. That's good to hear. The good news is, you get to choose which almshouse you prefer. The not-so-good news is, In the next three months, both of you must conduct fundraising activities for that home as proof that you can work together. - What? - What? Good idea. I agree. Someone texted me saying that he's Dean Zak. Oh, God. Okay. So I've picked our almshouse. Excuse me? What makes you think it's your call? It's your fault for rushing out. And I had to give her our answer. So, you've picked one? Of course. What's it to you? Are you an expert in almshouses? That's not the point. I get to choose too. Well, I've chosen. That's it. - Change it. - I've chosen. - I don't care. Change it. - I don't care. I've chosen. Zakiah, right? Just Zak. Oh, Zak. Zak, actually, I was the one who chose the home. - It's the closest to this college. - I see. So, I hope that settles it. All right, Yaya. I've got to head back. Mom's all alone managing the store. There's no one to help her. Okay. Take care. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Okay. Bye. Goodbye. What? Campus Bulletin! We're now waiting for Zak and Yaya. Hakim, I heard that they've been assigned to do some charity work. The Campus Bulletin wishes both of them all the best. Charity work at a home for delinquents? Can you believe it? It's not like both of them are good role models to begin with. But... Here they are from the dean's office. They don't seem remorseful at all. - Why? - Did you get expelled? Don't you have anything better to do? What could be better than this? You're actually proud of this? You got that right. It went viral, didn't it? Even if it means ruining people's lives? - Am I the best content you can get? - I know, Zak... You were the ones creating trouble. We just recorded it. It's your own fault. She's speechless because I'm right, obviously. "Rest and Reset Youth Center." Catchy. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. - Hi. - Hi. Is the principal in, miss? Principal? That's too formal. Just call me "Kak Jijie". Wow, you're the principal? Yes, I am. Kak Jijie. Hi. - How do you do? - Fine, thank you. Sorry for not addressing you the right way. It's fine. I'll take it as a compliment. Thank you. We're actually from Help University. - Miss Zakiah and Miss Zakiah? - Yes. Great. Let's go inside. - Follow me. - Okay. Welcome. It seems empty. The hostel is upstairs. But for now, only three kids are staying here. But these other kids come in daily. Say hi. Hi. Everyone loves our Internet area. That's the most popular spot. But let's check out upstairs first. Since we use our hostel fees to manage the daily kids, and since only three kids are staying here, maintaining the house financially has become a bit of a challenge. But it's fine. Later, I'll introduce you to the hostel kids. They are eccentric in their own way, - and they have different personalities... - Oh, my God. Ohsoyaya. I'm your biggest fan. This is Hanis, our hostel head girl. Hello. Are you pregnant? No way. It's always been like this since I was a kid. Someone must've put a spell on me because I'm so pretty. Is that it? No, of course I'm pregnant. You can't actually believe I've had this since I was a kid. Dear God, that would be unbearable. So later, I'll introduce you to Cinonet, Gangster... Gangster? What's up? Hey. Wake up. What's with her? - She's just weird like that. - I see. Where's Cinonet? How should I know? Hello. - Are you new here? - Yes. - I'm Cinonet. Just call me Net. - Zak. I thought I had my watch on. Net! Give it back. I was just messing with her. So, what kind of trouble did you stir? Trouble? No, we're not juveniles like... You're quite the pickpocket. Can you teach me? No problem. First lesson, it's all about the misdirection. After that, it's... All right, enough. Spare your thieving tutorial. Just carry on with what you were doing. Thank you. All right then. We'll talk again later, okay? - Kak Jijie, may I use the toilet? - Yes, of course. Let me show you where it is. It's right here. Go straight, then turn right. Okay! Go ahead. To the right. Yaya? Yaya, are you okay? I'm okay. You're scared of them, aren't you? No. It's just that... What are they in for? It's better if you ask them yourself. Don't be afraid. They're actually nice. But why is there an option for day care and hostel? Shouldn't they be confined, with curfews and all? And not to be allowed to wander about as they please? The thing is, Yaya, this is not a prison. While it's true that the hostel kids were sent by their parents, this is also their safe house. A place where they won't be judged for what they did or who they are. Okay. All right then, before anything else, I welcome the both of you to our youth center. We're still cleaning. You like football? No, futsal. We used to have a team. We even went through some training. But quite a number of them are gone. There are just three of us. Hardly enough to join a tournament. Where did you practice? Kak Jijie would normally bring us to a futsal court. But... that was back when we had more money. We were able to rent a court and all. First prize is RM5,000? There's no way we can enter it. Plus, it's just around the corner. I don't think there's enough time to train for it. You're sure about this? No harm done with just one. Kak Zak is rich, isn't she? She always uses Grab to come here. I mean, she can walk. Her university is not that far. I saw her Instagram. She sells all the clothes that she has modified. Maybe that's where her money comes from. Didn't you delete all your social media accounts? I created a fake one so I can stalk people. - Brilliant. - Hey! What are you doing? Hold this. Nothing. You must be crazy. Can't you see she's with child? It's only one cigarette. Plus it's original. There's no additional substance. Will you just relax? Relax? If you want to ruin yourself, be my guest. Don't mess with other people's lives. Got it? Giving someone a cigarette is wrong, but sending someone to the hospital is right? I beat that guy up because he was a real jerk. I can beat you up too. I can't believe they picked on you. Who was it? They called me a fatty. That's not cool. - Rifa, Shanti. - What? Come see this, quick. Come quick! Hurry up! Seriously? Come quick. Hurry up. Are you serious? This place is shutting down? Yes. We're running out on funding. It's a pity, isn't it? Where are we going to hang out? Fifi, you can hang out with your pretty stepmom. That's not funny, Shanti. Okay. I'm sorry. What's funny is if we don't do this together. But, Gadang, I don't know how to play. Will there be a coach? Stupid! Why are you yelling? It's nothing. I just can't control it. Is it like tics? Tourette syndrome. Mild. Okay. Will there be a coach? Yes, of course. We start tomorrow at 5 p.m. Zak. Can I see you in my office? Yeah. Rifa. This RM5,000 would really help the home. Kak Jijie. Why did you tell the girls this place is shutting down? It's true, right? You told me there's not enough funding for the home. Yes. But you have no right to scare them like that. Okay. What's wrong with that, Kak Jijie? It's for a good cause. Yes. But who'll pay for the futsal court? Our university has a futsal court. We can use it for free. Who's going to take them there? Me and Yaya. Really? Does Yaya know about this? Know about what? Why didn't you discuss this with me first? And you want me to be coach? - It's just sports. - No, no, no. This is futsal. I only know how to cycle. They're both sports. But they're different. Do you have any other ideas? Well, yes. I can use my Instagram to raise funds! You mean your account that's full of haters now? Haters will be haters. I still have some supporters left, okay? I'm not counting on it. - This place is so nice. - It's so big. It's so nice. Look at that. Okay, welcome to our university. This place is huge! What courses do they offer here, Kak Zak? Plenty. But we're here for futsal practice, and since today's our first day... How much do you think one semester costs? I have no idea. It must be expensive. Hi, Yaya. We are going to stop our sponsorship until this matter ceases. Hi, Yaya. There's no need for you to do any review for us anymore. Okay, guys. That's enough. You don't need half an hour just to put your shoes on. We need to start practicing. Get in the court now. Come on. Hurry up! Happy practicing. You're not joining us? - I'm not playing. - What? Not only did you plan this without discussing with me, you're also asking me to coach them even though I know nothing about futsal. And now you won't even play? First of all, I came up with the idea after having spent just one day at the home. At least I had the initiative. I don't see you coming up with any bright ideas. Initiative without proper planning... Initiative without proper planning is utterly pointless. Wise words. Why don't you walk the talk then, okay? With your proper planning? Just show what you can do, and make sure we win. Oh, okay. Fine. I'll carry out the work that you have started half... Sorry. So very little of, and I will make sure that we win. - We are going to win. - Sure. - Without you. - Okay. She's coming. Okay. Negativity, be gone with you. Okay. Let's start with warm-ups. Make a circle, please. We have just arrived at the futsal court to watch their first training. Okay, as you can see... Make a circle. Okay, good. Okay. We will start by warming up. - Kak Yaya. - Yes? Who are they? Will they be recording our practice session? What? You want me to tell them off? Wait. It's all right. Let me take care of it. Don't worry. Don't worry. What are you guys doing here? Hi, Yaya. We're here to cover your charity work. So that you can ruin our reputation even more? It's not like that. If you don't want a bad reputation, then just be on your best behavior. Okay. Start recording. Okay. It's settled. Let's start by warming up. Gangster. Thank you. Okay. Let's start from the top. Everyone must follow. Count to five. Keep looking up. Please. One, two, three... Four, five. Very good. Okay. Now, turn your head to the right. One. To the right, not the left. To the right. Two. - Turn to the right. - Wrong way. - Look the other way. - To the right. Wrong direction. Don't hog the ball! Yeah, that's the way. It was Rifa. Play futsal properly! Good job, everyone! Good job! Good job, girls. I'm so proud of all of you. We need to give our absolute best, okay? - Because we are going to win this! - Yes! Yes, we are going to beat everybody! Yes! Good job! Okay. Go wash up. Good job, good job, good job. What's this? Haven't you learned anything? If you've got something to say, you can say it to my face. Fine. Why are you such in a bad mood? Were you not there? We suck. It was our first practice. What did you expect? I don't know. Better than this. How are we going to win the tournament? If we practice some more, we can definitely win. "Wow" what? I'm sick of this. I mean, you really do live in your own world, don't you? Yaya Land, where everything just magically oh-so works out. What do you mean? Please, I know your type. And what type is that? You're Instafamous. Culture shocked. Thrust into the limelight. Suddenly, everybody adores you, and you get whatever you want for free. You don't even have to work. Has it ever occurred to you that I get whatever I want through my own effort? And I'm not as negative as you. Negative? This is me being realistic. There's a big difference, Yaya. Giving up before even trying. Yes, that's so realistic. I don't have time for this right now. I finally get to study what I love, and now this happened. One more problem and my parents won't be paying for my education anymore. You know what, Zak? You said I'm always in Yaya Land, right? Actually, you're just the same. You really think you're the only one struggling? No. Everyone else struggles, not just you, Zak. - Right. - Yes. You're here on a scholarship. Even your bicycle is sponsored. What is your struggle, actually? You turn everything I say into something negative. Some attitude! I'm sorry, Yaya. Our product doesn't need any review at the moment. It's okay, Yaya. Everyone makes mistakes. She's pretty. But her attitude... What's happening here? What happened to your baby? Someone slashed my tire. Haters, probably. Well... Too bad. Okay. Just relax, okay? Everything can be fixed. Don't... Wait. Don't worry. It's okay. It's just tires, just tires. Okay? You can bring it to a bicycle shop, right? No? No. What time will you be done with your classes? Come on. - 2. - What? - 2. - 2? Yeah. Same time as me. Okay. I have an idea. What? This is quite bad. Not only is the tread slashed, you must change the tube as well. How long will it take to fix it? About 25 minutes. Okay. Thanks! No problem. You know, that was my first time taking a Grab? No. You must have used Grab before. I mostly ride my bicycle. Why? It's part of my training. Wow! That's... pretty amazing. I don't even know how to ride a bicycle. Really? My sponsors were supposed to pay for everything, including the entrance fee. But after our fight went viral, they're saying they want to reconsider. Do you really need their sponsorship? Can't you just pay for it yourself? Is it that expensive? You can use your scholarship money. I'd rather not. That money is for my studies. Plus, if my family needs financial aid, I can use that money to help them. I see. But, you still can use your scholarship money first. If we win the tournament, you can "borrow" the prize money and pay back the scholarship, then return the prize money later. You're really something! You know I can't do that. Zak, do you think we can win the tournament? We need a proper coach. Oh, my God! Why didn't I think of this before? Yes, I was a futsal player, but I can't coach the team. But, I might know someone that might help us out. Ready to play? Fifi! Get in here! Why did you push me? Selfie! Thanks. Zak, did you notice Hanis covering her face when we took the selfie? You're right. I wonder why. She's probably a little insecure. You think so? She's your fan after all. She's always complimenting how pretty you are. People like her usually have issues with their self-esteem. What are you talking about? She's cute! She is cute. But still... What if you take a selfie with her? That way, when people comment about her cuteness, she'd feel good about herself. Maybe that will help. Yes. Okay, ladies. Everybody is doing a much better job. Give yourselves a big hand. Gangster and Cinonet. That was a long toilet break. My stomach was acting up. Okay, I need to have a word with Cinonet and Gangster. The rest of you can go home and get some rest. I'll see you at the next practice! - Thank you. - Thank you, coach. - Hanis. - Yes? I never knew Cinonet was interested in medicine? Yes, since forever. Figures. Okay, bye! - Hanis! - Yes? Let's take a selfie. No, thank you. I'm really shy. Come on. Just one. Okay, but only for your keepsake. Don't upload it. Okay. Say cheese. Look at that. You're so pretty! Girls. Let's go! Hurry up, let's not keep coach waiting. - Come on. Let's go. - Come on. Kak Yaya Why did you post our picture? Did you like it? Look at the comments! They're saying you're cute. What have you done? I told you not to upload it. Oh, no. What do we do? That jerk just left a comment. Show me. What a horrible human being. What's actually going on? See for yourself. Hanis has been off social media for months now. What? "Been off social media"? The guy that got her pregnant has been spreading rumors about her online, saying she's a slut and all sorts of horrible things. That's why Hanis deleted all her social media accounts. She doesn't want to see all this! She was so deperessed, her baby almost died because she wasn't taking care of her health. Thank God, the baby survived. Well, it's happening all over again. Why did you post it anyway? I didn't know about... She clearly said not to post the picture, didn't she? Come on, guys, it's not her fault. She didn't know. Neither did I. Lies! Of course you didn't know! Did you even bother to get to know us? Shanti... You really didn't want to help us win, am I right? You're only doing this because this is your punishment. How did you know about that? Cinonet took a peek at your files in Kak Jijie's office. You two were the ones catfighting in the video that went viral, right? I've seen that video too! That was you two? You two are the drama queens of social media. No, it's not like that. I... Enough! Hanis refuses to come out of the toilet. Let's go to her. Let's go. Both of you have done enough. We're going back home right after this. My God, what a foul-mouthed boy! And look at all these horrible comments made by other people. I know. I feel so bad! Well, I think it's time for damage control. What would you suggest, coach? Yes, did you say anything to Gangster and Cinonet? They're not fighting anymore. Normally, when people fight, there's an underlying reason behind it. Look at Gangster and Cinonet for example. Gangster's annoyed at Cinonet for being a bad influence on Hanis. You know Hanis is pregnant. It turns out, Gangster is an adopted child. Her mother left her at the hospital after she was born. And Cinonet? She doesn't really want the stuff that she steals. It's just psychological. She steals because... it makes her feel empowered, because she feels so powerless at home. Powerless? Well, wouldn't you feel powerless if your own flesh and blood, the people that's supposed to care for you, took advantage of you? You mean... Oh, my God. I wouldn't have guessed. Well, it's true what Shanti said. We never took the time to get to know them. Well, it's never too late for a bonding session. Large Pan Super Supreme. Enjoy your meal. Thank you. Dig in, ladies. Another house meeting? Stop whining, just come! Gadang, Rifa. Come here. Surprise! What's this? A bribe? I wouldn't call it that. This is a peace offering. And to show how sorry we are. - No! - We're not easily tempted by pizzas! Pizza Hut. Hey! - Control yourself, Gadang. - But... Who cares? Hanis hasn't even come out of her room! It's okay. We'll go see Hanis later. Plus, we have one more surprise! What surprise? Hanis... I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I just wanted you to feel good about yourself. I know. I wanna say sorry too. It was really my suggestion. It's okay. I've already turned off all the comments and blocked the jerk. - Yes. I suggested that. - And me too. I can even delete the post if you want me to... No! Don't! No? Haters are going to hate, right? Exactly. Most of the comments are just nonsense. All that matters now is that we care about you. - A lot! - "We"? Yes, we. Because aren't we a team? You really mean that? Of course we do. If we didn't, then why do you think we made... this? And... this! It's not that bad. "Not that bad"? Kak Zak designed this herself. Do you have my size? Of course! Come and check it out. This is Fifi's? Cinonet, here take it. Take it. Come on. Yes, that's it. - Do I have one? - For you, Hanis? Hold on! For Hanis! And Shanti! I hope you like it. It's not entirely his fault, though. He only took the drugs to cope with his demanding job as a truck driver. Driving long distances and sometimes at night. All for the sake of his family. But... he got addicted to it. Well, at least your dad got addicted because of work. My stepbrother takes drugs for fun. He uses all the money that he gets from my parents for drugs. Okay guys, I'm sorry to break this up, but it's getting late. Those who are going home, better make a move now. Kak Jijie. Yes. Can we sleep here tonight? Of course you can. Thank you. Rifa. You're sleeping in my room, right? Yes. My old man lost at the gambling table again. I'm afraid to go home. Did he lose a lot? A lot! Too much. Are you talking about us? Not at all. Rifa here is crashing with Gangster tonight. Why not Cinonet's room? Doesn't she have an extra bed there? That bed is already booked. Am I right, Gadang? Yes, sorry. Why are you apologizing? I don't pay any hostel fees. Don't be silly. Why don't you just go home? My home is really small and I have many siblings. My sister who's in boarding school is back. I'll just make it more crowded. How many siblings do you have? Seven. But there's only one room. Seven in one room? Is your mom okay with this, not going home? My mom doesn't care anyway. I think she prefers it. I take up too much space. Nonsense, Gadang! Even if you share a bed with me, there's still plenty of space to spare. That's because you're small. - That's why your name means "Tiny." - I'm telling you, it'll have room. Come, give me your hands. Okay. Have a good game! Have a good game! Have a good game! Have a good game! - Sorry we're late. - Sorry. - Let's go. - Let's go. Okay, girls. Don't forget anything. Let's go! Wait. There's too many of us. How are we going to get there? - Kak Jijie. - Yes? Are you sure you can drive this thing? Excuse me? I've been driving these kids everywhere with this "thing" for years! It's never failed us! Never comment on this van. She gets so touchy about it. - I see. It's her baby? - Sort of. Kak Jijie! This van still okay? Okay, this van is okay! - Okay. - Let's go! We're going to the tournament! Oh, my God! - There's parking over there! - You're so loud. Take a breath! Okay, girls. Let's go! Okay! Take my bag, please. Open the door, please. Open it slowly. Thank you, Kak Jijie! Oh, my God. What, never seen a van before? Is that even a van? Let's go. Gangster. What? Whose phone is that? Nicked it off the girl who mocked us. Girl, you're so naughty! I'll hand it over to the lost and found later. - Let her panic for a bit. - Good idea. Can you? I'm so nervous. - You can do this, right? - Sure. - Are you from Rest and Reset? - Yes! Okay. Have a good game, guys. Thank you. Keep it clean! - We will. - Did you hear that, Gangster? - TNF? - Yes! Oh, my God! Look how hard they can kick. It's okay. We can do this. Wow, check that out. Are they your fans? - I don't think so... - Support 3R Home? Here. Appreciate the effort! Good luck, guys. You'll be lucky enough if you make it to the quarterfinals, judging from your practice sessions. Did you hear something? Yes. What is that annoying sound? Sounds like a fart. Tell Coach I'm going to the toilet. Okay, ladies. First line up. Gadang, Shanti, Zak, Gangster. Fifi, are you okay? I'm having period pain. Then you'll sit this one out. It's okay, coach. I think I can play. No, I don't want you to force yourself. Rest and do some warm-ups first. - If you're really up for it, let me know. - Coach. - Got it? - I'm off to the toilet. All right. So... Cinonet, you're in. Yes! They've become best friends. No fighting! Have good game! Go! Rest and Reset! The goalkeeper is sleeping! ONLINE CAMPUS NEWS This is the game that we're waiting for. That's right, Hakim. But can Rumah 3R team defeat the strongest team, Red Heat? I think they will lose to them. The goalkeeper from the other side can really score! Watch your defense, girls! Good job! Campus News Bulletin! Wow, the team of delinquents from Rest and Reset made it to the semi-finals! How will they compete with other strong teams? With their unprofessional handmade jerseys... Wait! What's the problem here? You're the problem! Stop being so negative about them! - Stop please! - This guy is so annoying! I agree with Mateen. Hakim, look here. Have you forgotten why we do this? We're supposed to encourage, not criticize people. You're saying this because you have your own agenda! You're into that Zak girl, right? - You're just the same! - What? I see you making eyes at Fifi all the time! You no longer have integrity, Momok. You can't focus on your job! This is not about... You're both alike. You're no longer serious about this! I'm the only one who is committed to this job. In fact, you're using this to get girls! Am I right? I'm the only one committed to this Campus Bulletin, do you realize that? I'm not like you guys! Hey. Hi! Hey, girls. I'm going to the toilet. - Okay, be careful. - Okay! Hello. Fakhrul. Hey, Hanis. I saw your Instafamous friend upload a picture. You were in it. So I decided to come and see you. What do you want? Nothing. I just wanted all my friends here to know, there's something... really nice here. She really is "nice." You're one lucky dude. So, this is the work that you were talking about? What do you think, Hanis? I don't know, guys. Hanis here sells it cheap. Everyone can afford it. Everyone has even tasted it. The child could be anyone's. Enough! You're horrible! Oh, my God! Thank God, that Fakhrul didn't file a police report. Gangster! Do you want to add another case in your report? And Gadang? What got into you? What possessed you? You're normally so gentle. I can't believe you actually sat on that guy! Gadang actually sat on that guy. It's not funny, Cinonet. But it's quite funny, Kak Jijie. Fine. It's a little funny but... That guy couldn't even move, Kak Jijie! - Gadang and her weight. - Hey. This doesn't mean I'm letting you off easy. I have an idea, Kak Jijie! I can sit on them one by one, as their punishment. What the...? Then who's gonna sit on you? All of us! You're so dead! You girls really are something! Loan sharks did that? I'm really sorry. Why didn't you tell us? I didn't want you to worry. How much did you borrow? RM20,000. Idiot! That's a lot. But you've promised to pay them back. How can they still do this? Dang it. Can't we just report this to the police? I don't think that's a good idea. You don't want to mess with these people. They'll get nastier if we go to the police. No. I think it's best if we focus on fundraising. Fundraising? Yes! Fundraising! Even though we did not win any cash prize, but there are lots of other ways to raise funds, right? How about a charity fashion show? - I can even... - Perfect timing. We just got famous! Why? I sent you to the almshouse to do charity work. Not to teach those kids how to become famous like you two. That's not our fault, and not the kids' fault too. Then whose fault is it? That Fakhrul guy went ahead and provoked one of the girls! As the more mature adult, couldn't you just advise them? We're not their discipline teacher... - Enough! - You should let me finish... That's enough! Okay! This has become a serious matter. I will bring this matter to the board to be trialed. Trialed? Yes, a trial. The board will decide whether you get to keep you scholarship. What? Or whether you'll be expelled. Okay. We will prove our innocence! In the meantime, we still need to continue collecting funds for the home because - they're having problems... - I'm sorry, Miss Zakiah, but until the trial date has been set, you and Miss Zakiah are not allowed to visit the home or contact any of its occupants. - Why? Tell me the reason. - You want to know why? Because the faculty will not be held responsible for any bad influences that you two may bring to the home. - Okay, we're not... - That's enough! That's enough for today. You're dismissed. Thank you. Thank you. Don't worry. Don't worry, okay? We can still plan out the fashion show. In fact, nobody even has to know that we are... Zak. Stop. What? Were you not listening? I could lose my scholarship and you could be expelled. Did we do anything wrong? We didn't, right? It's not about who's right or wrong. Why take the risk of getting expelled? So what if we do get expelled? It's easy for you to say. You always have things easy anyway. You can just apply to another college. I'm not like you, Zak. I worked hard for this scholarship. If I lose it, my family can't pay for my tuition. Where do I go then? No, Yaya. You don't seem to understand. If I got expelled, my parents are not gonna support me for my education. But don't you see? The girls need a home more than we need this college! They're gonna lose their safe house. The house that was trashed by the loan shark? You still call it their safe house? That's why we have to do something about it. Yaya. Where is the Yaya that I've come to know? The one who is never negative? No. But this is terribly negative, Zak. You said we were supposed to be realistic. I am being realistic! It doesn't matter what I say! You want to risk getting expelled and now you want to get involved with loan sharks? Do you know that this is dangerous? I have a family, Zak. I can't do this. And I thought we were your family too. You know that's not what I meant. It doesn't matter what you mean. You're really selfish. No. I want out of this mess. And I don't want to be involved with the girls anymore. Where are you going? The Rest and Reset home. - But the Dean forbade it. - I'm not involving you, okay? Carry on with your perfect life. Yup, thank you so much again. Okay, bye! How did it go? Did Zalora agree to collaborate? Yes, Kak Jijie! Thank God. A big brand like theirs will help hype up this event, and that's what we need. I'm so glad. - Thank you. - You're welcome. One part is done, so... But, you don't look very happy? In fact, you look sad. It's nothing. I'm just worried for the kids. They get negatively judged so easily out there. People call them losers. Delinquents with no hope and future. Even before they start their struggles. But it's places like this, amongst their friends, with people like us who try to understand them, that they might just get... A fresh start? Exactly. They deserve that. No matter what happens, I will fight for this home. Thank you, Zak. Okay. I need to go now. But don't forget we need to check out the event space tomorrow. Yes, I won't forget. Zak Yeah? Whatever the outcome is, even if we don't reach our target, I'm very proud of you. Okay? Thank you, Kak Jijie. Thank you, Zak. - Hello? - Hello, Dean Mariam, I'm Jijie. Miss Jijie? Principal of the Rest and Reset home. - Miss Jijie from Rest and Reset home. - Correct. What can I do for you? Thank you. You're welcome. - See you again! - Thank you so much, see you again! - Come on, girls! - Let's go home! - It's spacious, isn't it? - Yes, it sure is! - Come on! - Okay, get in the van! Move it! Case trial tomorrow, 3 pm at the Dean's office. Yaya. What do you want? Tomorrow is your trial, right? Yes, why? So you can record the moment we get expelled? No, I... - Excuse me. - Yes, sorry. We have heard both of your statements and they seem consistent. But you both don't have any evidence to back you up. And what concerns me now is... I received an information yesterday about how Miss Zakiah is still going to the Rest and Reset home, despite strict orders not to do so. This is a serious disciplinary problem. But she is only there to help the girls with the fundraising. I know Miss Zakiah. I was told the same thing by Miss Jijie, the principal of Rest and Reset home. But, it's still a violation. I will now show you a video that was handed to me yesterday by Mr. Hakim of the Campus Bulletin team. The incident at the Futsal Tournament... Push my meeting to four o'clock. Okay. - Yes! Thank God! - Thank God! Yes! - Sorry. - So... And Hakim... You're welcome. Thank you. Tomorrow's the fashion show right, Zak? Oh, my God. No, I have to go. Why? Fashion disaster. The hem is too short. Zak, you know what? We can take you there if you want. - Really? - Yes. - Okay! - You want me to come with you? No. You worked way too hard for the tour, okay? Just go ahead. Can you give us two minutes? All right. Can you wait downstairs? - See you later, okay. - All right. We have to make the fashion show go viral. I agree. Yaya... I know those girls are a nuisance to you. They don't belong in your world and they're completely different from you. They're completely different from me too. But... what I learned from them is, what makes them special to me... is that no matter what they will take care of each other. Because that's what families do. Hanis, Gangster, Cinonet... Everyone. This is the only real family that they have. And that includes you. I really have to go now. Bye. START Hi, my favorites. I want to tell you about these group of girls that I just met and befriended recently. They have changed my life tremendously. We have nothing in common. One is a pickpocket, one likes to beat up people, one is going to be a teenage mom, and many more. Long story short, they are what we normal people would call outcasts. But now, they're forced to fight for their home because that is the only safe space they have. They were forced to play futsal in an effort to win the cash prize. It doesn't matter if they're yelled at as long as they are together. Yes. They find strength in their friendship. The support that they have for each other helps them face any challenge. And I believe, that is what we need. Mutual support and empowerment. These girls have taught me the meaning of friendship. In less than 24 hours, they'll be holding a fashion show to raise funds for their home, of course. Please, go and show your support. Go with your friends. It'll be held at Ruang, Shah Alam! Hash tag, "Fashion Gives Back." Yes, they're different. But that difference is what makes them special to me. Hi Yaya. How is it going? Hi. Yes, I'm doing good. Hey! Nice outfit! Thank you. Is it custom made? Yes! My girlfriends made it. Wow, nice! Okay, we'll see you on the road. Bye. - Campus Bulletin! - News. I'm Mateen and I'm Hakim! We're now at Ruang, Shah Alam, to cover the charity fashion show. It's a fundraising event for the Rest and Reset Youth Center. Not only students and lecturers are attending the event, we also have renowned designers. We have Alia Alizar, Afiq M, Rico Rinaldi, Tengku Syahmi and many more. Wow! These people are lending their support and you should too. That's right, Hakim. So please come with your friends and family! And don't forget the hash tag "Fashion Gives Back". It's you. Miss Facilitator! - Can you please help me open the trunk? - Okay. Thanks! Stand by, 15 minutes to go! So, are you girls ready? Yes! Can I not go on stage? Why, Gadang? Models don't look like me. Then you'll be the first one! Kak Yaya! Hi, girls! Everyone looks gorgeous! Gadang, I will go on stage only if you do. - Me too! - Me too. Listen here. All of us won't go on stage unless you do, Gadang! All right then. Yes! You can do this! FUNDRAISING TARGET ACHIEVED BY COLLEGE STUDENTS - Hurry up, we're already late! - We're late! Hurry! Hurry! Close the gate! Why are you girls so slow? Shut the gate! - Hurry up, Shanti. - Let's go. Get in the car now, Cinonet! Okay, let's go! Please be quick. Our friend's having a baby. Push! Good girl! You're doing good. I can't wait. Isn't this the second floor? No, this is the third floor. Is this the third floor? This is room 301. - Peace upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Who wants to see our latest addition? Come in. - Hi. - Hi. Nobody's gonna hurt you, okay? I promise.
