♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ Waking up ♪ The pedal's down, my eyes are closed ♪ ♪ No control ♪ Whoa-oh-oh Sun, water, beaches, gorgeous sunsets. Yes! This cruise is going to be great! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! This isn't happening! What? What? What is it? I can't find my Ziggpad! We have to go back. What if it's gone? I'm ruined! All my work... years! It's... Ellie. Ellie? Ellie. Ell... Ellie. Ellie! Ellie! Hmm? Ziggpad! Oh. Ellie! Sorry. Here ya go. What did I tell you kids about never touching this. Hmm. Yes! Oh! My "Snobby Squirrels" app is all ready to go! I just wish I had one more thing to push it over the top. Like a catchy jingle that makes you want to pound your head against the wall to make it stop? That's exactly what it needs! Knew there was a reason I married you. Okay... (Muttering) Whoa, they got water polo! That must be a pretty big pool to fit all those horses. Sometimes I think Nate has to be kidding. Yeah. Hey, maybe you should just go back to obsessing about everything that might go wrong on this trip. Um... global warming has accelerated incidents of ocean disasters. Don't come crying to me if you can't find a lifeboat. Yes! Just became a seventh-level Master Thief of Mythonia! Oh, that's so awesome... said no one ever. Good one! Come on Piper, leave Cam alone. He's not bothering you. Don't worry, Sis. I've become adept at tuning her out. Along with most of reality. Okay, really? Knock it off, Kids! Look I know it's been difficult since your Mom and I got married, but... it's time for us to come together as a family. Mm-hmm. The Jensens... Not again. And the Bauers... Are now the Jensen-Bauers. We're all in the same boat. Well, not yet we aren't. Uh, no. Uh-uh. 'Cause we're... gonna be... Come on, you guys, your Dad has a lot riding on this product launch, so all of you need to be on your absolute best behavior, okay? Yeah, and word is the new boss, Mr. Bragg, is real tough. Okay, what do you think of this? ♪ When the Bumpkin Beavers are to blame ♪ ♪ And mayhem and mischief are their aim ♪ ♪ The Snobby Squirrels can surely claim ♪ ♪ They're ready for action and always... ♪ Lame. Not the word I was looking for. Hmm. Kids there's so many fun things to do. You're gonna love this. Look, there's even a sea lion named Schnitzel! Aww. Ahoy there, Mateys! I am Barnacle the Clown, your Maritime Merrymaker! Ooh, hats! Okay. Yeah! Oh, no, I'm not wearing this. What's with the lovely lass? She has Coulrophobia. Uh... It's an unreasonable fear of clowns. I'm sorry, "Unreasonable"? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? And just when I thought this trip couldn't get any better. Okay, you're breathing on me really hard. Could you not? Hats for everyone! Oh! Oh, my gosh! Okay, lets go! Keep up. Keep up. Look at that! Look at... This is gonna be so much fun! I know. Mr. Bragg! How are you, Sir? "Bowser," isn't it? It's Bauer, actually. Uh, huh. This is my wife, Sophia. Nice to meet you. Hello. And this must be your lovely wife? This is my 16-year-old daughter, Melina. Oh, right! Of course. Cool belt. Well, the outfit definitely needed something. You better stay sharp there, Berger. After this launch, we're gonna have millions of eyes watching us. I am expecting great things from you and your app. "App-solutely," Sir! That's funny. Oh, good. Attention: The Ziggle Product Launch will begin in 56 hours and 5 minutes. Shopping? Yeah, let's go. Dude, what are you doing? Horrible. Ah! Who throw that! Hmm? He's talkin' to me? Do not insulting us with feeble paper crowns. Ooh. Hello, beautiful. Hey, avert vision orbs from sister! Vi... Vision orbs? Move aside, lowly little runts. Why you blocking my goings? Gee, what's his problem? Probably afraid of clowns or something. Yeah. Ooh! Ah! Who's ready for a little Ice Cream Bon Voyage Party down by the old swimmin' hole before we shove off, hmm? You guys should go ahead, have some fun, right? We'll meet you back at the cabin. Mwah! Bye. Really? You're gonna leave us here with a strange man in makeup who has seaweed for hair when criminal activity aboard cruise ships is at an all-time high? Oh, wow. Oh! I'm gonna call you "Chipper"! Moxie Cruise Lines invites all guests to the pool deck as we prepare for departure. Gather round as old Barnacle shows you how to make your very own ice cream! Yes! Oh, hey, whoa, Ellie. I don't even know you. Okay, you will pick your ingredients and then we'll toss 'em into this here mixing bowl full of creamy goodness. And then old Barnacle is gonna pour some of his magic potion. And we'll toast... To the voyage that awaits us! Oh, cool! Whoo! Ooh. Are you kidding me? Now the clown is messing around with liquid nitrogen! That stuff is like 320 below zero. It can snap steel in half! That was awesome! I wanna try! Hey! You almost cost me a life! Like you even had one in the first place. Okay, do you ever shut up? Do you ever try and make me? That was fun! Liquid Nitrogen is in the pool! Cannon ball! My game! Not my game, not my game, not my game. My new dress! No, no, no, no! Not my game. Not my game. Polo! Ah, Ellie overboard! Ellie overboard! Mayday! It's the shallow end, Ellie. Attention: As your Moxie Cruise sets sail, please join us for dinner and a show. Oh, what do you think? Am I S.F.I.H.? S.F.I.H.? So fresh it hurts! It hurts all right. Whoa, where'd you get that? Borrowed it from Mom. Perfect. Well, then why are you taking it off? So she doesn't see me in it, duh. I'll just throw it on later. What... Oh, hey, whoa! Hands off! This is an original Alfonse Moogli. I worked three summers to pay for it. Iceberg! Whoa! I knew it! Where is my life vest? It's the password to the safe. I don't want to forget, so I'm telling you guys. My Ziggpad's in there and it is completely off-limits until after the presentation. No music videos... no online shopping... no nothing. Got it? That means you, Sticky Fingers. What? Don't look at me. I never remember passwords. Now, I want you to imagine... you're standing at the South Pole... in your underwear. Boxers or briefs? On the count of three, you shall return from your polar journey, fully clothed. One, two, three! Consider your mind exploded by The Indescribable Paul! Whoo-hoo! Now, for the finale, I'll need a few volunteers. Uh-oh! Okay, there is not a shred of scientific evidence to prove hypnosis is real. It's a total crock. How about these four lovely children right here? That's you guys! Get on up there. Getting up in front of a crowd? Definitely not my thing. I'll go. It's not like you can penetrate this steel trap anyway. Well, it's better than sitting here, bored out of my mind. Careful. Don't embarrass yourself. Hmm. I want you to relax your body and simply focus on the sound of my voice, nothing more. In honor of tomorrow night's highly-anticipated performance of "Pirate-tacular, The Musical," I want you to imagine that you're a Merry Band Of Buccaneers. Modern or Colonial-era? Just... You know... Everyone breathe... and concentrate on the sound of my voice. As you listen, you'll find your eye lids getting heavier and heavier until it's impossible to keep them open. That's it. I've never seen them this quiet. Yeah... From now until sunrise, I want you to imagine that you're a bunch of plundering pirates at sea. In three... two... But I... I'm a steel trap. One! Hmm? Hmm? What? Hmm? I... I'm blind! No! No... (Muttering) Oh, whoa. Whoa, guys, get up. Who trashed this place? Hmm? Oh, hey. Oh! Did you do this? Um, good morning? Is this a... What the... There's a leg handcuffed to my arm! Whoa! Oh! Why are there ping pong balls all over the floor? Mom and Dad are gonna kill you guys. You have an anchor tattoo on your neck. Hmm? Tattoo? Oh, whew, it rubs off. What is going on? Ah! Oh! Oh, no, no, no! This is not funny! Oh! Eww! What the... O... M... G! My hair! Ah. Oh! Did you... Nate? Cool! Nate? Morning. What is that stuff? Hmm? Cool! I'm a mutant! Hello? Um, guys? Hello? Nate, Nate! Get in the shower and rinse that off right now. Geez, okay, "Mom." Ridiculous! Seriously guys, what is going on? The last thing I remember was that magician guy hypnotizing us... into thinking we were pirates! Okay, we gotta get this room clean before Mom and Dad... Honey... let them have their privacy. It'll help them bond. You're right. See ya at brunch! We just need to get dressed! Right. We'll meet you at the restaurant! Oh, God. This stuff's not coming off! Grape? Something funny here? Yeah, it's grape. Oh! Whoa. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, God! No, no, no! No, is this Dad's Ziggpad? Please don't be broken! It's gone! Oh, no! This is not good! Oh, Man! Okay. Oh, please be in the safe, please be in the safe... It's not in the safe! But this glove is. Give it to me. There's something inside! Okay, all right... nobody jump to conclusions. Maybe Dad brought his tablet with him? Without the cover? Okay, let's just relax and go to brunch... Wha... uh, excuse me? What am I supposed to do with this? Oh, yeah, let's get you something for that. "See Other Glove." Huh. Ew. What is this doing here? It smells like, ugh, mothballs! Ugh. Why is there a seal in our closet? I believe that's a... A sea lion. What the... It smells so bad! Ah! It's gonna eat my face! Ugh! I guess that means he likes you? I don't know. Ha! Well, there's no accounting for taste. Ew! Actually, he appears to be an excellent judge of character. What's this? I wish I didn't do this. Ugh. Ew! You grabbed that from the puke? That is so nasty! Can everyone please try and stay focused? We need to go meet Mom and Dad! Let's put it in the bathroom for now. Worry about it later. Mm-mm. Okay, that's it. Come here, Puppy. Yeah, you got him, Nate. Come on, Boy. You stink. Yeah. Keep him moving. Come on. Seriously? It's working. Yeah, you better not use my toothbrush, either! On second thought, it's all yours. Just make sure you clean it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, guys, be cool. I got this. This leg is killing my back. At least you're not purple! Attention passengers, don't forget to put your name... Uh, excuse me, Young Lady. Have you seen my daughter, Melina? Um, no. Haven't seen her. Oh, that's strange, she usually checks in by now. That's all right, I'll check her room. Thank you. That's weird. What's that about? Well, okay. Hey, you! Hey. Took you guys long enough to get here. Um, yeah... Ellie had explosive diarrhea. Mm. Mm-hmm. Nate... you're purple. Uh, yes! Thanks for noticing! It's my new... My new, uh... sunscreen. Yeah. Super-protective. And what's with that awful coat? Oh, yeah, no. I'm... I'm totally fine. They really have the A/C cranked up in here. Oh, uh, Dad! Happen to have that Ziggpad handy? Oh, yeah! I'd love to take a peek at that app again. I told you, that stays in the safe until the presentation. Oh. Oh. And for security measures, it's got the only copy of my "Snobby Squirrels" app. Um... I have "Pulpaphobia." Mm. Fear of pulp. Mm-hmm. It's strong in here. Oh, yeah! Is that new? Never heard of it. Hello there, Newcomers. You're all welcome to help yourselves to our Briny Brunch Buffet. That sounds disgusting. Well, it's better than last night's "Squidsicles." Ahoy there, Kids! Oh, ahh! It never ends. Now I hope you're all enjoying the second day of this fun-tastical cruise-a-majiggathon! Barnacle wanted to let you all know... Mm! That tomorrow night... After the big Ziggle Launch, there's gonna be a super-swell farewell gala featuring a concert with a top secret mystery guest! Ooh! Mm! It's gonna put the "Dig" in "Shindig"! And you are going to look dazzling in that new necklace I got you. Ooh, thank you. I was nervous about bringing it... Oh, no! Where's the necklace? But this is the perfect occasion... It's not in here. To finally break it out! Aww... um... yeah, I'm late! We gotta go! We gotta go play Underwater Croquet! Yeah! But you have to eat! (Muttering) What about the Briny Brunch? The Ziggle Product Launch will begin in 35 hours. Okay, all I know is Mom's jewelry was in my purse, and now it's gone! Wait a minute... isn't that Melina's belt? What's that red stuff? Okay, I don't want to point out the obvious, but we know Melina is missing, and that looks like... Okay, if you guys don't shut up, you can add me to the long list of things you're scared of! Look, our top priority right now is to find Dad's Ziggpad, or we're gonna be grounded for life! Great, we're at Defcon One and all she can do is update her status. Ugh, I'm checking my feed from last night, "Snarknado." Geesh. Maybe we posted a photo or something. All right. That's weird. I have a text message from "Unknown." Well, what's it say? Uh... Nothing. Hmm. Wh... Thank you! "There's only me. There's only you." "See you at noon." Okay, who is this obviously insane person? I know. Cuckoo! I have no idea. The number is blocked. Wait, why are there pictures of me and that cute waiter guy? Maybe he helped you off Bragg's daughter? Perhaps it was an ill-fated love triangle. Look, Ellie... Okay, okay! Bigger fish to fry, People! Okay, let's construct a timeline. We know that we saw the hypnotism show at 8:00, right? And I took this photo with that waiter at 9:23. Speaking of fish, shouldn't we get that big blubber-butt out the room before Mom and Dad get back? Actually, technically speaking, a sea lion is not a fish, it's a mammal. Hold it right there! You're all coming with me. What? I'm sorry? Us? March! Now! I mean, Ma'am! Ma'am! Yes, Ma'am. I'm... I'm marchin'! I got my eye on you. My advice is to confess now and save yourselves a lot of trouble. Confess to which thing? I mean, what thing? 'Cause we didn't do anything. Why are you purple? Oh, you're just seeing my powerful aura. You know, some say it's almost blinding, so you might just wanna look away while you still can, 'cause, uh... Excuse me, but who are you exactly? Head of ship security. H.O.S.S., for short. And the four of you are in a boat-load of trouble. Ma'am, we have no idea what you're talking about. Mm-mm. Why are you wearing a house coat, Young Lady? Hmm? It's 90 degrees out! And you smell like mothballs. Um, uh, is smelling like mothballs against the law? No, it's not. But let me show you what is, Miss Smartypants. Arr! Hand over the food! That's us? I... I don't know. We're going to jail. This was last night's midnight buffet after it closed. The costumes were stolen. We've had to cancel tonight's performance of "Pirate-tacular, the Musical"! Oh, no! Not "Pirate-tacular"! "The Musical"! Yup, "The Musical." Look, uh, Hoss... Mm-hmm? We have no idea who those adorable, merry scamps might be, but it really just looks like some harmless fun. Harmless? Yeah. Really? Yeah-huh. Does this look harmless to you? Aye-aye, Captain! Overboard! Imagine that. Throw it overboard. That's a body! What? We're in trouble. Is that us? That was definitely us. Want to tell me what's going on here? Huh? Or why Schnitzel the seal was kidnapped from the aquarium? A sea lion. Shut up! What? He... he said, um... He said "Stop Lyin'." Mm-hmm. As in, you know, "Girl, you stop your lyin'." I will not. I mean, I am not! Stop confusing me! Face it, I got you all on tape. Now... who's ready to talk? I am. No. She doesn't want to talk. By all means... let her speak! That footage would never stand up in court. If you had clear images of the perpetrator's faces, you would've shown them to us by now. Instead, you have nothing more than circumstantial evidence. You simply can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that that was us. Mm-hmm. So either arrest us... And risk losing your job... Or release us posthaste, forthwith. You have made a very powerful enemy here today. From this moment on, I am going to be on you like stink on skunk. Stink on skunk. What? Now, get outta here! Okay! Okay! Yes, Ma'am... Sir! Sorry! Whew, that was close! But at least we got a few more things to add to the timeline. The security footage showed that we were on the deck by the pool at 1:12 am. And we were also at the midnight buffet. If we could just figure out when the midnight buffet was! Huh? Man. Oh! Okay, um, hello? Can we please focus on the biggest revelation here? Piper threw Melina overboard because she wanted her belt! "A," No! No, no, no, I didn't, and B... you were there too! Wha... so, I'm an accessory? Over an accessory? Guys, enough already. This is serious! We've got to find Dad's Ziggpad. If we don't, we're all gonna be thrown overboard! How did Schnitzel the sea lion get out of the bathroom? He didn't get... the stairs! Oh, no, he's loose! Come on, are we sure that's Schnitzel? You know, a lot of fish look... Yup, that's Schnitzel. Yeah. We can't just leave him wandering around the ship! We'll divide and conquer. Ellie and Cam keep looking for Dad's Ziggpad. Nate and I will go talk to that hypnotist. And if anyone finds Schnitzel, return him back to his show. We'll meet back at the pool. All right, on three... One, two, three... break! What the heck? Oh. This... Um... Nate, get back here. Shh! Shut up! Shush! I've been expecting you. I'll bet you have! I assume you're here to return my handcuffs? Yeah, about that... you wouldn't happen to have the key, would you? 'Cause, you know... Any chance, that you... Yeah, we don't have that. The key is inside all of you. Can you please just tell us exactly what happened last night? Isn't it obvious? You became a Merry Band Of Pirates. What? You completely ruined our lives! Ruined them? Or did I vastly improve them? Um, hmm, let's see. If you haven't noticed, I'm purple! He wasn't like that before. The Indescribable Paul only sees what's within. Can you just try not to be weird for one minute and tell us how to get our memories back? He sucks. Awful, isn't it? Four individual notes that clash. Oh, brother. But force them to work together in harmony... They create beautiful music. Oh, I get it. It's a metaphor. See, we're the four notes that clash and were gonna... Shut up, Nate. Yep. I wish you the best of luck in finding your answers. Now, if you'll excuse me... This is ridiculous! How are we supposed to find the right tablet? Literally everyone in here has one. Hmm? "Ellie, where were you?" Okay, that's weird. Well, now we know where you were supposed to meet your mystery date. Ha! I bet it's killing you that you don't know who it is. Okay, please, I have way more important things to worry about. Okay, you guys! That guy Paul was of no help. Yeah, and no sign of Schnitzel. A-ha! This guy? No way. The fight is on! Main square, 4:00. We will duel. What? Why? Because I have accepted of your challenge, when you slap my face with this! The other glove! Look, whatever happened, I really need that glove back. You only receive of glove by defeat of me. Huh? Oh! Banjak! Huh? Hmm? You are purple! You are sea monster! This may be a cultural difference... Yeah. 'Cause I'm no Banjak. 4:00, we fight for your glove, lowly little runt! Ah, ha! Bye! All right. Okay, can this day get any weirder? Seriously, Piper! Stop ogling him. We've got a job to do! I'm not ogling him. I'm ogling his watch. It's insanely expensive. How can a waiter afford something like that? I don't know. Maybe it's a fake. Or maybe he's a thief. Come on, we need to follow him. Guess it's just me and you, Man. Me and... What? Or just me. Oh, we lost that waiter guy. I'll bet he's got Mom's jewelry and Dad's tablet. Probably snatched them from me when we took those photos! It's always the cute ones. Wait, I know that voice. ♪ There's no way to say this song's ♪ ♪ About someone else ♪ Every time you're not in my arms ♪ It's Cody Simpson! ♪ I start to lose myself He's the mystery performer for Dad's Ziggle Launch. O.M.G. No way! ♪ Don't you let 'em see me down ♪ ♪ Oh, you have taken over my days ♪ ♪ So tonight I'm going out ♪ A little more guitar in the monitors and we should be good. Thank you guys. I'll see you at the show. Okay, Cody... You're just so incredible. What are you doing here? Oh, so sorry to interrupt. We're just looking for somebody. Somebody? Clearly it wasn't me, was it? Good going Ellie, now Cody Simpson officially hates us! Wha... What did I do? Melina! Oh, my gosh, you're alive! Eww, what's wrong with you? Get off me! Okay. Oh... Wait, why do you have my Mom's jewelry? Nice memory. You traded me your jewelry for my belt last night. Which, I have to say, looked pretty ridiculous with your whole pirate get-up. Look, I really need that back. Forget it, I'm not taking that belt back. You spilled cherry sauce or something all over it. Uh-oh. We were supposed to meet Mom and Dad five minutes ago! Oh! Let's go! Like stink on skunk! Hey, are you guys having fun? Yup! Mm-hmm. It just never seems to end. Sorry for the late notice, but... we have to back out of the family port excursion. You guys go. Bergstrom! What happened to your leg, Sir? Huh? Oh, well now, that's a funny story. I lost it to a hungry Komodo Dragon on a golf course in Osaka in '91. You know, last night, I took off my prosthetic to go for a little moonlit dip... somebody snatched it. What? I ask you, what kind of inhuman villain is going to run off with another man's leg? Beats me! Bergstrom! Yes, Sir? Let's go. Yes, Sir. Catch up to you later. Bye. Yeah, bye. See ya later! I have to get his leg back to him! Okay, Guys, we need to search the ship for Dad's Ziggpad while everyone's on shore. It's got to be here somewhere. Oh, it's almost 4:00. I have to meet that crazy guy in the town square. Cameron, that guy wants to fight you! I'm not gonna fight him. But I have to get that glove back! "See Other Glove," remember? There's got to be a clue in it. (Chattering) You just worry about getting the glove. I'll figure out some sort of distraction to get you out of the fight. Yeah. Okay? Break! What is this? Ah, look who is not made of chickens after all. Look, can we talk about this? Enough of your chatter! We fight for the glove now! Banjak! Aah! What? Where? Oh, right. Banjaks are purple. Oh, I gotta get that glove! We duel for the glove... There it is! And for honor! Whoa, whoa! Here goes nothing! What are we doing here? Well, remember that liquid nitrogen from the pool? There's got to be more around here somewhere. I thought we were trying to get the leg off. Are you not familiar with even the simplest fundamentals of science? Oh, well, I... just... Oh, here. This will freeze the locks of the cuffs, which will shatter after enough pressure is applied. Mm-hmm! Ah! Hey! You were the guys who raided the kitchen and stole all that grape yogurt last night. We were? Yeah, you were dressed up like pirates, shouting "Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of Fro-yo"! Are you gonna turn us in? Me? Nah. I thought it was funny. But he didn't... That guy has got no sense of humor. (Native language) Ingmar is an expert in the Swedish Art Of "Fishjitsu." I'm sorry, "Fishjitsu"? Yeah... (Native language) Bah! He's this mad about stolen yogurt? Ah, nah, but he was furious about that ice sculpture you threw overboard. Ice sculpture... overboard... Yeah, it was the spitting image of his beloved grandmother. (Native language) We should... I'm gonna go. Okay, yeah. (Native language) Whew! Wow, that was close! We almost just got fish mongered or whatever he said. Yeah, but... I totally could've taken him with the leg! Yeah, I know you could have. Come on, let's stow the stump and find that waiter guy. Okay, let's hit it! This isn't fair! I've never done this before! You cannot run! Nate! Nate! A little help! You are irresistible, little purple Banjak. Okay, sure. I do impressions, too. Nate! Nate! Ah! Oh, you'll have to do better than that! I think I got this. Hyah! It's just like a video game. Aah! Whoa! Ah, ah! Aah! You all right, Man? Wha... Huh... Whoo! Yes, I did it! Take the glove! It's the perfect cover. He scopes everyone's valuables while he's serving them. That girl has no shame what so ever! I'll be doing the Fashion Frenzy event tomorrow. Maybe you can stop by and cheer me on? It'd be nice to have someone other than my father in my corner. I think I might be working. Maybe you can rearrange your schedule for me? I swear, I'm gonna throw that flirt overboard... For real this time! Come on! We need to get you out of this. You're a little late! Oh, sorry. I was just... No way, you got it! Yeah. And the clue inside says, "X Marks The Spot." Great. More pirate bologna. That's not getting old at all. Oh, we've got to get in that room! Hey, what are you doing? Softball. Starting pitcher. Huh. This guy's been busy. Yeah! What's in there? Oh! It's not Dad's. Hyah! Yah! Caught you red-handed this time, breaking and entering! Try arguing your way out of this one, Miss Lady Lawyerpants! We just discovered a major thief on board! You should be thanking us. Yeah! What's going on? Aah! Aah! Oh! What'd I do? We know you stole all that stuff, Pretty Boy. Fess up! Where's our Dad's tablet? Is that what you think? I'd do that to you after all the fun we had hanging out last night? Just answer the question. Those are gifts from my father. He's the CEO and owner of Moxie Enterprises, the multi-national conglomerate of which this cruise line is a subsidiary. I'm sorry, wait. So, you're the owner's son? You wait tables. I'm learning the family business from the ground up. Ah. I'm terribly sorry, Sir. I will take these lawbreakers to the brig now if you don't mind. That won't be necessary. I invited them in. They're here legally. But they're responsible for a wave of... Unless you want me to press charges for being Tasered without cause, I suggest you be leaving. Immediately. Buh-bye. Wow. Thanks. I got to ask, what made last night so awesome that you would do this for us? Simply put, you were the most spontaneous, sweet, and fun girl I've ever met. This one right here? Shut up, Ellie. And where exactly did we hang out? On the upper deck, under the stars. Beginning to think it might not have been as memorable for you. Well, last night was a little... fuzzy, but you definitely seem like someone worth remembering. I'll tell you what. All is forgiven if you save me a dance at the big launch tomorrow night. Sounds like a date. Attention: The Ziggle Product Launch will begin in 16 hours and 58 minutes. There! I think we have it all cleaned up. So, nobody's found anything? Mnh-mnh. There's got to be some sort of clue or something that we've missed or overlooked. Whoo! Guys, this loofah thing really does work wonders! Check it out. No way, dude! You got it off! Well, almost. What's this? Oh. Yeah. This is weird. This Ping-Pong ball has a number on it. B-12? Maybe it's a really big vitamin? Oh, yeah. Wait a minute. Bingo! It's a bingo ball from the Senior Bingo Tournament. Looks like they have a game every day. Well, we know we didn't have the tablet with us at the Midnight Buffet. I didn't see it on the video. Well, maybe we lost it right before then. We've got to get into that bingo hall. When's the next game? Uh... Doors don't open for half an hour. What do we do until then? I still need to get Mom's jewelry back from Melina somehow. Yeah, and I need to return her dad's leg. Hmm... Whoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Hey, Kiddies, who's ready to join me for Fashion Frenzy? Whoo! Now, for the special contest, I'll need some special volunteers. Come on now, don't be shy. Ooh, yes! Yes, you. Okay, now, the rules are simple. You've got three minutes to go into this old trunk of junk and pick out whatever gives you the most swaggerific, spectacular-docious outfit as judged by our audience and Barnacle's patented Whoopie-Noise-O-Meter! Whoo! Good luck. I really need that jewelry back. Like the clown said, good luck. How about this? If I win Fashion Frenzy, you return the jewelry. What if I win? What do you have that I could possibly want? Psst, Piper. Listen, you are hands down the most fashionable person I know. Just bet the Moogli. If I had a purse like that, I'd bet it on you. Everyone gather round. We're gonna need all of you. No way. That's clearly fake. It's a real Alfonse Moogli. Signed and everything. Deal? Definitely. Now, you're gonna jump into that trunk, and once you've selected your items, go backstage and get all dolly-dolled up. On your mark, get set, Frenzy! Ooh, I like these shoes. Ooh, that's so cute! Yeah. This is gonna work so well. That's cute. Go for the boa! Get the boa! Aah! Time's up! Time's up! Time's up! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! I'm glad we got it. Okay, I'll sneak over and put the leg by his crutches so he can't miss it. What if he sees you? Um, uh, just signal me if he starts to move. Just keep it subtle. Now ol' Barnacle's gonna bring out the contestants one by one, and the loudest applause will tell us the winner. First contestant! Make some noise, people! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Ooh, 60. Not bad. You know, the new Ziggle product launch is more than a presentation. It's a spectacle. Wait, no! No! Ooh, second contestant! Yes! Oh, it's energy and rhythm working in unison and being in the moment. I mean, that's the Ziggle philosophy in a nutshell. 75! Whoo! Third contestant! 84! Yes! Fourth contestant! No! Oh! 92! Yeah! Ellie's gonna get caught! Hey, Bragg, look over here! Hey! Look at me! Hmm? 99! Ooh! Why, I haven't seen readings like that in all my two years of hosting! But we have one more contestant, so... 92! We need more clapping. She's gonna lose! Come on, what do we do? Hey, I've got an idea! Change-up. 100! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, Piper! Come on, Sis! Whoo! Winner! Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Hoo-hoo! Ah, yes. Did such a good job. That's the best one I've seen yet. That's my leg. Whoa, Baby, where did you go? Looks like you're in good shape. Still fits like a leg. Let's dance! Whoo! Hey, Guys. Congratulations. You really earned this. Yours was insane. That was a total "Girl On Fire" moment. Your outfit was amazing, Melina. It could have gone either way. Maybe we can hang out sometime and trade some fashion tips? I'd like that. Oh, we can still make the Senior Bingo Tournament. Okay, I got to return this stuff back to the safe before Mom gets dressed. Uh-oh. What? It's a Senior Bingo Tournament. They're never gonna let a bunch of kids in. I got this one. Out of my way, Whippersnapper! Grandpa came to play. G-50. I-20. O-62. Excuse me, Fellow Senior, were you here the other night? I'm here for every game. Can't win one to save my life, though. I-25. Did anything unusual happen? No, not that I remember. Oh, unless you mean those pirates ransacking the place. Oh... that's exactly what I mean. Oh, they were having a fine old time. One of them stole the cash box, but he left all the money. That's terrible pirating if you ask me. Oh, and one stole Mrs. Fogelman's coat. But, she deserves it. Miserable, cheating old biddy. Yeah, Fogelman, I'm talking to you! I-17. Did you happen to notice if any one of them had a Ziggpad Tablet? A what? Oh, it's one of those, uh, newfangled thingamagidgets. Well, there's one way to check. There must be something I'm missing. They took a picture. You took a picture? Yep! Yep, those salty sea dogs were as close to me as you are now. Can I take a peek at your camera? Sure. O-16. Where's the picture? It's inside, silly. I'm gonna get the film developed later this afternoon. I... I don't understand! I'll take care of that for you, Ma'am. Ship's courtesy. Well, that's mighty nice of you. Well, well, well. What do we have here? G-59. Who's lucky today? You got Bingo! Oh, my. Oh, my gracious. Bingo! Bingo! You've just won a fabulous marine sports package, complete with turbo-injected hydro blasters! Guaranteed to blast you 30 feet... up in the sky! A thrill of a lifetime! Attention, Ziggle Product Launch will be in 1 hour, 47 minutes. How are we supposed to get those pictures? That's your department, Master Thief. Didn't you get like to level 900 or something on that game? I don't know if I can do it. Cam, it's the bottom of the ninth, we're fourth and goal, and we really need a three-pointer right now. Besides, I believe in you, Bro. Okay, fine. But we have to work together. Don't worry, I've got something in mind that's so brilliant that it'll go down in the history books. if they ever make history books about mayhem on cruise ships. Just wear this. There she is! Get ready! Okay, got it. Okay, let's see what we've got here. Terrible hat... Bingo! Ahoy, Matey! Whoa! Great Poseidon's Beard! Whoo! Thank you! Ah, thief! Dude, that was awesome! Yeah, I can't believe I did that! Ah! You! Unh! Thief! These will show if we had Dad's Ziggtab at Bingo. Come on, let's go back to the room and check these pictures out! Come on, let's go! I don't get it. They know how important this is to me. Well, maybe they're already at the theater. Have you noticed they've been acting different lately? A little... better? Yeah, It's nice. We should go on cruises more often. Attention: The Ziggle Product Launch will begin in 24 minutes. I can't believe it. After all that, we didn't have Dad's Ziggpad at Bingo. That was our last hope. It's game over. It's gone for good. It's probably at the bottom of the ocean by now. Well, we might as well go face the consequences. The least we can do is be there like we promised Mom and Dad. Guess that's it, then. We saved ourselves, but we couldn't save Dad. He's going to be publicly humiliated, fired in front of millions! We should destroy the evidence. Although, it's kind of a shame. Yeah. We all look so happy together. Arr! You know what? Let's just keep it. At least we'll have this memory. Yeah. Guys? It's been under our feet the whole time! What are you talking about? Look! "X" Marks The Spot! Go for it, Nate! I got this! I'm a diggin' machine! Come on, dig, dig! You can do it! Come on, it's gotta be in there. Come on, Nate, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on, dig! Come on! Come on, we only have 14 minutes. I'm diggin'! Okay, come on! He's almost there! I see it! Have we got it? That's it! I got it! I got it! Just keep digging about it, Nate. Oh! We got it! Oh! It's locked! Ah! Dad's done, and so are we! Wait a minute. What? What... The key from Schnitzel! Is that it? Go! Do you think that's it? Open... Come on. Come on. Come on. Is it working? Dude! We got it! (Chattering) We gotta get this back to Dad! Hurry, come on! Dad goes on any minute! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Wait, go, go, go! Come on, follow me! All right, come on. Come on, go! I think it's this way. Go, go, go, go, go! We gotta make it, guys! We're running out of time! Let's go, let's go! Hurry up, hurry up! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! We're almost there, come on. Come on, around the corner. Run, run, run, run! Come on, people, we're running out of time! Ah! (Muttering) Huh? Ooh! Hmm? Whoo! Hi! Bingo! Ladies and Gentlemen, Ziggle CEO, Balthazar Bragg! Go baby, go baby, go! This way! Don't! Please, Dad, wait! Dad, wait, wait, stop! There you are! We were worried sick about you. UH, we were... we were just off bonding and all. We wouldn't miss this for the world! We're homies now. Yeah. Thanks, Kids. Thank you! Good evening, good evening, everyone! That's ri... I would like to welcome you to an evening you will never forget! Okay, I'm up next. No! Whoa! Don't you guys want to hear about... our personal revelations and... profound life lessons? I mean, parents love that kind of stuff! I gotta plenty of it, I just... Uh, yeah honey of course we do, but... can we do it a little bit later? Oh, sure! Sure. Okay. Okay. Hey! You're gonna kill it. Now the new Ziggle Nova with 3D screen is going to let you take video chatting to the third dimension! A quick charge and we're ready to go. You're gonna be awesome. You all right? Yep. (Chatter) No! Did it crack? Oh, Mr. Bragg isn't just going to fire me, he's going to light me on fire and fire me out of a cannon into a fiery pit of fire! You... You gotta tell him to skip me. We can't skip you. What? What if we hard wire a connection between the tablet's hard drive and my game player? We could transfer the app so you can demo it through the projector over USB. Yeah. That's a great idea, Cam, it just might work! We've got to buy some time! Wait, I have an idea, but I'm going to need everybody's help, okay? Bragg is looking for a spectacle, we're going to give him one together. Uh, Nate, can you go out on stage and stall for us? I was born to stall. Um, Piper, we're going to need some awesome costumes, and fast. How fast and how awesome? Maybe I can help? I'm pretty good with costumes. But, don't get me wrong, Ziggle is also about smiles, and with that I introduce you to, the fun-tastic new app, "Snobby Squirrels"! Whoa, where is it? It's a... It's an incredible new game. You'll go nuts for it. Snobby Squirrels! Ellie, do something, anything! We need more time! Snobby Squirrels! Oh! Uh... uh... It appears we're having some engineering problems. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Whoo! Yeah! I'll take it from here, Mr. Bragg! Let me help you. Thank you very much. What's up everybody! Who's ready to be entertained? Ellie, come on, put your costume on! I... I can't go out there. Crowds are definitely not my thing! Okay, listen to me, there's nothing to be worried about. Now come on, let's do this for Dad. Get ready folks because there's more where that came from. Wha... I don't like this. Come on. Oh, gosh. Okay, now listen, when I say "Snobby" you say "Squirrels!" Got it? Okay. Snobby! Squirrels!

Cody, uh... Hi, um, I'm sorry that I missed our date! I was hypnotized and have like zero memory of the whole night! All I had was your text message, and I had no idea who you were until now! But, if you give me another chance, there will be a lot more "Only Me"s and "Only You"s, I promise! Okay, maybe I came on a little strong. And way too cheesy. Go. Now that's the girl I remember. Brave, gutsy, willing to take chances, maybe a little overboard on the science jargon sometimes. But it makes you original. Really? That's why you like me? Of course! Plus, you knew I wanted that sea lion set free, and you helped make that happen. Oh, uh... yeah. Funny story, we sort of, um, lost him. Shh. So can I see you again? Sure. If you didn't already notice, I do have a helicopter. What did we miss? Yeah, what's going on? Oh, nothing. But since we're all here, let's take another photo. I'd like to update my status.
