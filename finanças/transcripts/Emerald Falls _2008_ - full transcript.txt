[gentle music] [water roaring] [bird squawking] [air whooshing] [birds chirping] Hey! Hey! Isn't it magnificent? Hi, sweetie. I mean, you know, as soon as I saw this place, I thought, "This is completely me." I mean, god, look at that view. It's beautiful. You know, I look at this place, and I think I could quite happily die here. You're gonna blow your entire divorce settlement on this? Well, it's my money. - Well, it was my money once. - I only need a little bit because the bank's gonna give me the rest anyway. No, no, forget it. [Joni] What have I asked you for in the three years... - What have you asked me for? - Since you walked out? Nothing, you know, I haven't asked you for a thing. You've got your career, you've got your apartment. And I'm asking for one thing that I know would make me truly happy. I'm asking for your support. You're a kindergarten teacher. What do you know about running a bed and breakfast? - I wanna try. - You haven't thought this through at all. - What about the renovations? - I have. [Paul] The upkeep, imagine fixing this place up. - Well, Paul, that's why... - The staff, the insurance. [Joni] I'm asking for your help, Paul. Not gonna get any money out of me. Look at it. You're bloody mad. You'll be asking me how to file for bankruptcy within six months. - Zac, come on. - Go and rain on someone else's parade. [Paul] Zac, come on. Dad, I think I'd like to stay here with Mum. Stay? What about school? School down the road, just go there. If you think this conversation's over, you've got rocks in your head. Okay. Good-oh. [car door thuds] [car engine whirs] Well, I think it'll be great. Just you and me, Zac. It'll be just great. Wanna look inside? - Yep, let's go in. - Come on. Got your room all picked out. Come through here. Check it out. Isn't that good, hey? [Zac] It's kinda spooky in here, Mum. [Joni] Yeah, right up your alley, darling. [Joni chuckles] Don't you love it? Look. What's that? Someone's been in here recently. Fresh shoe prints. Dunlop Volleys. [Joni] Really? [Zac] There's another one here. What? Where are you going? [gentle music] [Joni gasps] Zac, slow down. [both screaming] - Who are you?! - Who are you?! [Joni] What are you doing?! I'm trying to sleep! You're trespassing! What, and you're not? I'm squatting. [Joni] What's the difference? It's about three months. Yeah, well, we're not trespassing or squatting. We're buying. You're buying? This house? - Really? - Yes, really. I'm Steve. You need a gardener? What, that'd be you, would it? I'm not just a pretty face.

Oh, yeah, building a new gazebo out the back. Can I help you? You're Mrs. Ferguson? - Yeah. - I'm Brett. [Joni] Oh, hi Brett. From the bank. It's only a couple of thousand. No, it's $3,447.53. Okay. Look, Brett, here's the thing. If I can't afford to do running repairs on the place, things stop working. If things stop working, people don't wanna stay. If people don't wanna stay, then there's no money coming in. If there's no money coming in, then there's no mortgage repayment, which is a lose-lose situation, except for my ex-husband, who'll feel like he's won again. [chuckles] So wouldn't it be better to focus on a win-win? How about a fortnight? No. You know, one day, I'm gonna be frail, slobbering, incontinent, living on the street. I'll embarrass you. You won't wanna look at me, but you'll have to. Do you wanna know why? - Uh... - 'Cause I'm gonna have your name tattooed across my forehead in capital letters. B-R-E-T-T. We need that money by the close of business next Monday. [telephone ringing] [sighs] [telephone beeps] Good morning, this is the Falls Lodge, Blossom speaking. Oh. Oh, dear. You must be devastated. It's so good of you to think of us at such a stressful time. Well, look, you try and have a nice day anyway. Is that the silver jubilee couple? Missed it by that much. Do you think we should still cash their deposit check, or... No. Does that mean we're empty till the weekend? There was a phone call from Sonia someone. The real estate woman? Yeah. If she calls again, you tell her if she shows her face around here, I'll put the hose on her. - [knocking] - Dr. Forbes, hi. - Hi. - Hi, Henry. Joni. Blossom, I've received the results of those tests. Right. This is terrible. Well, it doesn't have to be. Everyone has two copies of the gene. When both copies are faulty, then the disease manifests. And I'm a carrier? Yep. That means one of your genes is faulty, the other is normal. And carriers aren't affected because the normal gene compensates for the faulty one. But if both parents carry the gene, there's a one-in-four chance they'll have an affected child. I guess I should scratch kids off my list of things to do, then. [Henry] That might be a bit extreme. Easy for you to say. [Henry] It's always better to know, Blossom. It feels a bit weird talking about this here. Can I make an appointment to see you next week sometime? [Henry] Yeah. [bird squawking] [panting] [Steve] How good is the day? [Zac] Yeah, it's fantastic. Hey, is your Mum looking for me? I don't think so, why? - Oh. - What are you doing? Oh, I'm just waiting for some mates. They're coming up from the city. You going for a bush bash? Yeah. [Steve] Well, there's the most brilliant cave down there, just up the hill from the river. I'll take you there one day if you like. - Okay. - It's huge. You could live in the thing. - Oh, cool. - But it's secret, okay? - Yeah. - You know, I don't think your Mum would like it. - It's a bit steep. - Yeah. Well, you know, I won't tell if you don't. So you're not gonna jump? Do I look like the sorta guy who'd jump off a cliff? [lively music] Get outta here. - See you later. - Get outta here. ♪ Go take a step out side ♪ ♪ See what's shaking in the real world ♪ ♪ Go take a step out side ♪ ♪ See what's shaking in the real world ♪ ♪ Go take a step out side ♪ ♪ See what's shaking in the real world ♪ ♪ Go take a step out side ♪ ♪ See what's shaking in the real world ♪ [camera beeping] [camera whirring] I've told him a thousand times, it's dangerous running down there. You know, people get lost and die slow, painful deaths in the bush all the time. You fall over something, you break a leg, you get bitten by some evil creature and bang, your lights are out. I wouldn't even know where to start looking for him, you know. Here, hang on to this for me, would you, Bloss? You okay? Yeah, fine. Oh, there you are! I was beginning to think you'd fallen over a cliff or something. Nah. - How was it? - Good. He doesn't talk much, does he? [Joni] Pass me the G clamp, thanks, Blossom. Oh, we've got guests. [Joni] Where did they come from? Friends of Steve's, from his bushwalking club. [men laughing] [Joni] I didn't know you were in a bushwalking club. We've all got secrets, Joni. Five paying guests. - How good am I? - How long are they staying? Few days. I said they could have mates' rates. - What's mates' rates? - It's half price. So, really, there's only two and a half of them. [Blossom] That sack is moving. - Ah. - What's in there? [Steve] Lunch. - Ah. - Mud crabs. Fresh off the boat this morning. [Joni] Oh! [Steve] You said you wanted to explore the fruits of the sea... Steve, I've never cooked live crabs. You gotta kill 'em first. Here, give me your hand. [Blossom] Mm-mm. [Steve] Joni? - All right. - All right. [Joni] Oh, hang on. What are you doing? Don't be a big girl. Dead easy, just put your hand here, okay? - Like this. - Mm. - What are you doing? - One quick stab. [knife thuds] [Joni screams] Mm, looks like you've missed your superficial arterial arch and the dorsal vein. - That's good. - Am I gonna need stitches? No. A butterfly bandage should do the trick. So what's Blossom doing with the crabs, anyway? A bisque, I think. - Oh. - Don't have enough guests staying at the lodge to actually eat it. [Henry chuckles] Do you want to come for lunch? Might just do that. Don't forget to put it in your diary. When have I ever forgotten a lunch date at the lodge? I've just made a pot of tea. Have you got time for a cuppa? Oh, yeah, I'd love one. Thanks. - Milk? - Yum. Hey, how old's your bank manager, Henry? I wouldn't have a clue. Hide all my savings in my mattress. Mine's a foetus. Feel like I'm grovelling at the feet of someone whose feet are still forming. [Henry chuckles] Having money problems? Oh, nah, it's just a slow month, you know? How's Zac? Oh, it's hard to tell because he fluctuates between being monosyllabic and silent. Well, he's 15. Personally, I think silence is vastly underrated. Then I hear him on the phone to his dad and you can't shut him up. Makes me think that that's where he wants to be. You know, back in the city. Thought he didn't like living with his dad. That was six months ago. Well, we're all imperfect masters of our own destiny in the end. Aren't we? [gentle music] If we can look back without regret, that's the thing. [Joni] You okay, Henry? You know, I'm pretty sure I'm not okay. But this time, I might just be right. What do you mean? I'm clearing the decks, making a clean breast of things. They say getting it all down in writing is cathartic. Getting all what down? The final chapter of a very sad, and very protracted, story. How much money do you need? Oh. Oh, god, don't be ridiculous. I didn't come here for your money. I know that. Call it a loan. Yeah, no, you know what? I really appreciate this, I really do, but... This is a blank check. This might be one of the last chances I get to tell you how beautiful I think you are. [gentle music] [knocking] Come in. I've put the kettle on. Make yourself a pot of tea if you like. I just have to nip back upstairs. Won't be a minute. [ominous music] [bird squawking] [Joni] Oh, wow, what a great photo. Did you take that? [Zac] Yeah. What's that on the rock? An eastern brown snake. Mm, pretty common down there. Oh, it's lovely. Hey, listen, I've got some good news and some bad news. Hm? Is it about money? Well, the bad news is that we're going broke. But the good news is that Dr. Forbes has offered to lend us some money. What about Dad? Well, it's none of his business. Oh, what? Well, come on, hang on a second. What's the matter? Why do our money problems have to be Dr. Forbes's business? Well, he's a friend. He'll expect something back. We'll figure something out eventually. So you'll be sleeping with him. - What did you say? - Lunch is ready. Is Henry still coming? 'Cause he's not answering his phone. I'll get him. Wait a minute. Don't you say anything. As if. I have no intention of having sex with Henry Forbes, or anyone else for that matter. Well, not at the moment, anyway. Certainly not for money. That's just offensive. Zac, would you stop? Mum, if you take the money, everyone's gonna know. But what does that matter? Henry's a generous man, and he wants to help. He wants something. God, you sound like your father. That's funny. Dad says I sound like you. [Joni] Okay, we are here about lunch. We'll talk about the money thing later, okay? [Zac] Okay. [knocking] Hey, Henry, it's only us! [knocking] Henry! Oh, my, oh, my god. [sombre music] He's dead, Mum. Oh, Henry. [Zac] What do we do? Gotta call an ambulance. Oh, no, I'll call the police. Call the police. [loud thud] Okay, don't go anywhere, sweetie. Don't touch anything. Hi. Yes, it's Joni Ferguson here. I'm at Dr. Henry Forbes's house and I think he's had an accident. He's fallen down the stairs. [bird squawking] Zac, where are you?! Come here, sweetie! [winds whistling] [Callum] So what time do you reckon you left him? About 11. Did anyone see you leave? I don't know. Did Dr. Forbes say anything or do anything that you thought was a little unusual? Well, he said that he was into the final chapter of a very sad and protracted story. Oh, yeah, what story was that? I don't know. - That's interesting. - Mm. Anything else? No. You don't seem so sure about that. [Joni] No, no, I'm sure. I'm just, you know? [Jack] Well, if you remember anything, come down and give us a yell, eh? Okay. - Yep. - Well, hang on, hang on. So what time did the two of you get here? 1:14. Oh, that's very precise. Yeah, I've got a watch. If we'd gotten here any earlier, he'd probably have still been alive. Oh, yeah, why's that, son? His algor mortis. Body temperature postmortem. After death, there's a slight rise in the body temperature before it starts to fall. You should probably take a rectal temperature. So, watch a bit of telly, do you, son? Not much. [Joni] Okay, we'd better leave you to it. - Good-oh. - There were three tea cups on the bench. - He was expecting guests. - That's correct. Or he could have been doing the washing up. Right. Would you mind coming down at some later stage and making a statement, please? - Yes, sure. - There's another thing. And what would that be, Sherlock? There was somebody else here when we arrived. I heard a noise. Well, it could have been a draught, if you left the front door open. You should probably dust for fingerprints on the door handle as well as the cups. Okay. Yeah, we'll leave you to it. Okay. Well, I'm not taking his rectal temperature, if that's what you're thinking. [thunder rumbling] [bird squawking] Oh, Kaydence-Anne, that's such a beautiful name. Such a beautiful little girl. - Congratulations. - Thanks very much. That's wonderful. [group clapping] [Kaydence-Anne cooing] Kaydence with a K. What's wrong here, Joni? It looks like you stepped in cat shit. Henry's dead. [thunder rumbling] [Rosalie] We'll have to contact the relatives, I suppose. [Joni] Yeah. Did he have any? [Rosalie] I don't know. Do you know what algor mortis is? Body temperature at death. Why, is Jack talking about that? Oh, no. Zac. I don't think it's normal that a boy his age knows so much about death. Oh, well, I was heavily into reincarnation at his age. Yeah, but he's into the science of it and the gory details. - Oh. - You should have heard him talking to Jack and Callum. It was like he saw dead bodies all the time. Well, he's 15. Yeah, people keep saying that. Mm. Gosh, I can't really believe this. I know. He was such a beautiful man. Yeah. And a really good doctor. Ah. I think I'm gonna miss him. - Oh. - Yes. You know what? I really think he was struggling with something, I do. I saw him this morning. And he said I was beautiful. You? Yeah. Why, is that so weird? Oh, no, it's just, no, no. Just... Well, I was sleeping with him. Why, is that weird? Well, yeah, you're a minister. Well, the body might be a temple, but it needs the occasional worshipper. Oh. Oh. Oh, Rose, I had no idea. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm so, so sorry. Did you love him? Um. I don't know, I don't know. [Joni] Oh. - Wow, yeah. - Mm. Mm. [whistling softly] [gentle music] [thunder rumbling] [Blossom] How'd that happen? Well, I don't know, an accident, I think. Do either of you know whether Henry had, like, a heart condition or something? He trod on a nail the week before last. Had to give himself a tetanus injection. He didn't die from tetanus. No, but you can. He told me he might not be around next week. Well, what did he mean by that? [Callum] Joni, hi. Sorry. Sarge wanted to have a quick word with you. [Joni] Mm? [Callum] Did Henry give you a check this morning? Yep. Well, how much was it for? The check butt didn't say. It was blank. [Callum] Like open-ended? Yeah. [Callum] Why would he do that? Well, 'cause I told him I was a bit short and I suppose he was, you know, helping out. [Callum] Sorry, why didn't you mention this earlier? Well, I didn't think it was relevant. - Is it? - Well, I'm not sure. Have you still got the check? Yeah, oh, yeah, it's in my room. Great, well, Sarge wants to have a look at it. - Okay. - When you get a sec. Okay. [Callum] Thanks. [door clacks] [door thuds] Hey, the police think you had something to do with what happened, don't they? Oh, no, of course they don't. No, they're just covering their bases, you know. [Catherine] Excuse me. Is this Dr. Forbes's surgery? [Callum] It is, yes. Can I help you? Oh, I'm Catherine Reid. We had an arrangement to meet, but my train was running terribly late and... [Callum] Are you a relative? No. Has something happened? I'm afraid Dr. Forbes died this morning. [birds squawking] [crickets chirping] [Joni] Oh, something smells good. - Apple pie. - Yum. I've been thinking, I'd like to write Henry a poem and read it at the funeral. A poem? That's quite... Joni. Hey. This is Catherine, she needs a room. Have you got a room? Hi. Oh, yes, sure. No problem, just sign in there. How long do you reckon you'll be staying? [Catherine] Oh, just the night. - Okay. - I'll leave you to it. - Thanks, Joni. - Thanks, Callum. [Catherine] Thank you. Okay, here we go. Put you in room three. Had a long day? - Yeah. - Dinner's in an hour. Do you need a hand? Oh, no. Thank you. But Dr. Forbes was so not old. Well, not young young, but, no one else knows about that. [lively music] I'm not sure. Of course I don't want anyone else to know. That was totally personal between me and Dr. Forbes. [ominous music] [camera beeping] [camera whirring] [camera beeps] [camera whirs] [camera beeps] [camera whirs] [camera beeps] [camera whirs] [door clacks] So no sign of forced entry. Surgery. - Just through here. - We'll come back to that. [Jack] Righto. [muffled speaking] [camera beeping] [camera whirring] [frame rattles] Time of death according to the report is 1:00 p.m. [muffled speaking] [camera beeps] [camera whirs] Get the government contractor van here soon as. What, me? [Barnett] Yes, you. - Ah. - You been upstairs? Yeah, yeah, went up there briefly. How many times do blokes like you have to bugger up a crime scene before you work out what the rules are? We need to get someone out the front. [muffled speaking] [sneaky music] [thunder rumbling] [winds whistling] [Zac] Can you just hold on for one second? That's why I called you, Dad. Gotta get your head out of those bloody forensic books. You read too much. Here's an idea: Why don't you get yourself a pet? My shout. I know, a bird. - A bird? - Yeah. Girls love 'em. I'll get you one for your birthday. How about that? [Zac] Great, but can you just dig up that information for me? Yeah, yeah, now, what about this boat trip? Luxury boat, sail down to Adelaide, drive back. Be fantastic, do you the world of good. I'll think about it. [knocking] Okay, well, I've gotta go now. So call me about, yeah, on my mobile. Right. - Okay, later. - Bye. Hey. Dinner's at 10 past seven. - Cool. - Okay. Just... Mm, okay. Oh, no, no, I'll see you then. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. [sighs] [door clacks] Oh. Hey. - Evening. - Hey. - Need a room? - Yeah. Does it come with a towel as well? [Joni] Yeah, we've got soap too. - Do I smell? - No, oh, god, no. [chuckles] Well, come on through. How long do you reckon you'll be staying? Can I keep that open-ended? Yep. Sure. - Great. - Just sign in there for me. Pen and... Great. And, you know, I'm gonna put you in room seven. It's just down the hall on your left. Ned Montoya, that's an unusual name. [Ned] Yeah, South American, on my Dad's side. - Oh. - Is cash okay? Yeah, cash is great. [Ned] Oh, good. - Oh. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, it's a bit wet. [Joni] That's okay, I've got a hairdryer. [both chuckle] [sighs] Seven, down the hall. - On your left, yeah - Thanks. Tongue. Oh. [thunder rumbling] Those bloody plain clothes blokes, they think they're Christmas. Oh, and they're show ponies, most of 'em. Always throw their weight around when they get up here. [Callum] Oh, they're fine to me. [Jack] Oh, yeah, to you, of course. But see, they're intimidated by experience, know what I mean? Hey, did you see that? - What? - There is someone in there. Eh? Hey, just slow down there, son. Slow down. [Jack sighs] Oh, god. Rose. What are you doing here? It's just, I can't find any of his family. I can't find anyone. I just... He doesn't seem to know anyone. I've... I can't find any of his family. Cal, put the kettle on, will ya? Make a cuppa. But see, there's all these phone, there's no one. - He didn't ring anybody. - Just calm down. Calm down. She's right. [Rosalie] He just doesn't ring anyone. No one rings him. It's nothing, it's... [Rosalie sighs] - She's right. - Just don't understand. You see, I got out these. There's nothing, there's nothing. I can't find anything. [Jack] It's all right. You wouldn't catch me going back to a dead man's house. It's kinda creepy, isn't it? - Yeah, I guess so. - That'll do. So what happens to all of Henry's stuff now? You know, his files and patient records? They belong to whoever takes over the practise. Well, what if nobody does? They'd become part of the estate, I guess. Why? Oh, just wondering. Listen Bloss, we found an entry in Henry's accounts that says he gave you $5,000. Just thought I'd give you a heads up in case, you know. What? Someone asks. Asks what? What it was for. What was it for? A car. God, he liked throwing his money around, didn't he? Oh, maybe he was just a nice man. Huh, maybe. Bloss, have you seen the cocktail shaker? [Callum] Hi, Steve. [Steve] You on harder duties, mate? [Blossom] Just dump it in the basket, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be making cocktails next. Righto, see ya. - See ya. - Okay, see ya. I could have done that for you. He was here, you weren't. Hey, he's here a lot. - Is he? - Yeah. Everything all right? Why wouldn't it be? No, no reason. [mellow music] [Blossom] All done? [Ned] If I didn't think anyone was looking, I would lick the plate. Oh, don't let me stop you. There's apple pie if you can fit it in. I'll give it a go. [Man] I've missed dinner, have I? [Blossom] No, you've got plenty of time. Oh, good, rumour has it you're a legend in the kitchen. Oh, do me a favour and keep spreading it. So I was looking everywhere, everywhere, and I couldn't find anything. There wasn't... He's got no children, he's got no parents. There wasn't even a Christmas card. Is that normal? - Well... - It's not normal. It's not normal, it's not even close to normal. Two combustible Edisons, like angels pissing on your tongue. Occupational hazard. You know, some people live their whole lives alone, Rose. - You know that. - Mm. Oh, cheers. Joni. I killed him. You didn't kill him, Rose. - You loved him. - No, he loved you, so we both killed him. I think you need something to eat. Listen, Henry, he was caught between loyalty and lust, you and me, a rock and a hard place. Am I the rock or the hard place? It was the stress. You see, that's what gave him a heart attack. [Joni] Oh, Rose, he didn't love me. Well, he never called me beautiful. Okay, forget that, I'm gonna get you something to eat, all right? Hi, settling in okay? Yeah, place is fantastic. Oh, good, that's good. - Bathroom down the hall? - Yeah, down the hall, yeah. Good day. I'm Davo. Sorry to hear that. So what do you do, anyway? I'm a church minister. Gets 'em every time. [Rosalie sighs] [mysterious music] [mouse clicking] Everything you've done to this place is great. - Oh, thanks. - Mm. You know, I'd do a lot more, but I can't afford it. Have you been here before? Yeah, I used to come up here all the time with my wife, yeah. We met here as kids. Our families used to rent this house for summer holidays. Ah, beats my story. I met my husband in a queue at the supermarket. You know, the first time we stayed here, I chased her up to the turret and I locked the hatch on her. She had to scale the roof to get down again. God, I'm surprised she didn't kill herself. She nearly did. She broke her leg in two places just below the knee. She still married you? [Ned] Go figure. I guess that explains why she's not here. Fear of turrets. No. [Joni chuckles] Cancer. She passed away, a year ago tomorrow. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's okay. She'd really approve of what you've done to the place. She'd love it. Good, take my foot out of my mouth. We used to go camping down in the bush, and on our way home, we'd always stop out the front and sit in the car, and imagine what we'd do to this place if we had the money to fix it. The irony is, now she's gone, and I've got the money. Life insurance. Oh. Are you the guy that made an offer on this place? [chuckles] Yeah, but I was told that the owner was a hard-boiled witch who wasn't for selling. Yeah, well, you were told right. So what would you feel about a silent partner? What's... You know, someone who would invest in the place, but doesn't have anything to do with the actual management of it. Why would you wanna do that? I suppose it's the closest thing to owning it. I could throw a bit of business your way. Parties, corporate functions. Can I think about it? You'd be mad if you didn't. - I'm gonna turn in. - Okay. Sleep well. [Ned] Night. [sighs] [bird squawking] [birds squawking] [bird chirping] [Zac] You're up early. Shopping. What are you writing? Believe it or not, I'm trying to write a poem. That's cool. Oh, not so far. I need to rhyme the word integrity. Does it have to rhyme? 'Cause some poems don't. Well, that's a coward's way out. Are you making that pizza again? - Oh, you like it? - Yeah. [Blossom] Oh, okay, I'll make one just for you. Oh, you don't have to do that. It's a breeze. I love cooking in your mum's kitchen. Where I used to live out west, we had a kitchen the size of a phone box. [Zac] My dad's kitchen's a lot like that. Hey, how are you going with that whole Mum and Dad fandango thing? Yeah, you know, it's hard sometimes. My folks split up when I was 15 too. It was horrible. There's one good thing, though. Gets easier. It does. Promise. You still hoping they'll get back together? Yeah, but that's unlikely. Snap. [Zac] Compatibility. What? That rhymes with integrity. Well, it doesn't really. Does a bit. - Priority? - Nudity. I'm not rhyming integrity with nudity. That's a shocker. [knocking] Ah, hi, Catherine. Look, you didn't come down for dinner or breakfast, I just wanted to see if you were okay. That's very sweet of you. Thank you. [sighs] Are you okay? Yes, yes, I'm fine. You know, it's such a beautiful day. I was just gonna go for a walk. You wanna come? Five years ago, my son Michael fell off a train on his way up here. The coroner said death by misadventure. Apparently, he opened the carriage doors by himself, lost his balance, and fell out. You sound like you don't believe that. I don't, and the police didn't either. They were convinced he wasn't alone, but there was no proof. So many things just don't add up, like why was he on a train to the Blue Mountains in the first place? He had no reason to come up here. He was settled and happy. He'd just gotten himself a new girlfriend who I was gonna meet the next day. And why would he open the train doors? Have you ever seen someone open the carriage doors of a moving train? - No, I haven't. - You should try it some day. It's not easy. Couple of days ago, Dr. Forbes rang, said he had something to give me, something that related to Michael's death. Now, he's dead too. Did you know Dr. Forbes? Yes, I did. Do you think it's possible that he had anything to do with what happened to my son? Oh, Catherine, I would find that very hard to believe. Henry was a kind and gentle man. Ever since Michael died, my life has just been one long series of what ifs. What if he hadn't been on that train to the Blue Mountains? What if my train hadn't been late? I could have spoken to the doctor, found out what it was he had to tell me. What if? What if? [sighs] I am aware of a lot of this from the inquest. [Callum] I'm sorry, Mrs. Reid. - That was thoughtless. - No, no, that's all right. I never got to see him. My husband identified his body. He wouldn't let me see him. He thought it would be too hard for me, but it was harder trying to imagine. I had terrible visions. This is so much more peaceful than they were. Do you think I could have a copy of this? Yeah, of course. Cal. I'll scan one off and print it off for you. Thank you. So when Dr. Forbes said he had something related to Michael's death, did he indicate what that might be? No, no, he wouldn't say. He said it was a conversation we should have in person. [Jack] Right, so you think it might have been a piece of information, rather than something physical? [Catherine] Look, I don't know. Do you think it would be possible for me to have a look in the doctor's house? [Jack] Until Forensics are finished there, there's no chance of that. [Callum] I'd be more than happy to have a look for you if you like. Thank you.

This is supposed to be a secure forensic scene. You're committing an offence just being here. I want my medical records. I told you, Dr. Forbes's patient records don't belong... Cal, I've got test results in here. Genetic tests. My sister's got two kids with cystic fibrosis. I had myself tested to find out if that might happen to me. It's not right that someone can just walk in here and own that information. Cal, please. If you tell anyone I let you have that file, I'll deny it. [Ned] Nice work. - Federation, eh? - Oh, thanks, yeah. Yeah, it suits the house. [Joni] Yeah. Oh, god, no, don't do that. No, just, I put it in yesterday. You built this? [Joni] Yeah. By yourself? [Joni laughs] Yeah. Sorry, it's just that women that run guest houses usually don't build gazebos as well. You should get out more. Maybe I should. [Joni chuckles] How'd you sleep? Like someone hit me over the head with a brick. [Joni] Probably did. - [Joni chuckles] - So what are you using? Two or three inch nails? Um. A three inch. What, are you a builder? No, but I can use a hammer. - Do you mind? - Oh. [Ned] So did you have a think? Oh, I'm still thinking. I spoke to a friend of mine this morning. He was meant to be having an engagement party this weekend, but the venue he hired fell through. - Oh. - Yeah. He loves the idea of having it here. - Really? - Mm. Without seeing the place? Yeah, well, he's desperate. And he works for me, so what's he gonna say? He's put a deposit in the mail. Thousand bucks. Is that okay? Fantastic, yeah. It's okay. Good. [Joni chuckles] Give us your hand. His name's Mateo. - Mateo? - Yeah. This is his number, and I said you'd give him a call. [Joni] You're not railroading me, are you? Absolutely not. It's obligation-free. - Mum? - Yeah. [Zac] Sergeant Donnelly just rang and we've gotta go down to the police station to make a statement right now. [Joni] Now? Yeah, now. Listen, okay, look, no. Don't worry about this. I'll finish it off when I get back, okay? - Yeah. - Thanks. Thanks. [chuckles] [sighs] Do you know who he is? Could be my knight in shining armour. [gentle guitar music] [water roaring] [Davo] Hey, Captain, you on with that waitress or what? [Steve] What? [Davo] Violet. [Steve] Blossom, mate. If you don't mind, she's a front of house manager and chef. [Davo] Yeah, good bum too. Yeah, keep it up, mate. You'll be carrying drinks for the support crew. Hey, Cal, what's happening? I've got you worked out. Oh, what do you mean? You know what I mean. [telephone ringing] It's all right, mate. I'll get it. We should have a chat when you get a chance, Sarge. Yeah, sure. Falls Police Station, Sergeant Jack Donnelly speaking. Oh, yeah. Good. Righto. Okay, mate, yeah, thanks for calling. See ya. Cal, man the fax, will you? Autopsy report on Dr. Forbes coming through. - Thanks for coming in. - Oh, it's a pleasure. Listen, I think you should check out Henry's diary. Could have contact details for his relatives in it. [Jack] Oh, yeah, what diary's that? [Joni] It's the black one. It's an A4, it's got elastic on the front. It's always on his desk in the surgery. No, I didn't see it. Cal, did you see a black diary on Henry's desk yesterday afternoon? No. Do you want me to ask the suits about it? Oh, yeah, why not? Give 'em something else to whinge about. Now, did you bring the check in that Henry gave you? - Yeah, yeah. - Good girl. Now sit down. Um, I'll just talk to your mum on her own for a little while if you don't mind. Thanks, mate. [Callum] Coffee, Sarge? [Jack] Green tea. Mm-hm. Joni? [camera beeps] - [camera whirs] - Can I have a tea with one sugar and some milk? Thanks, Cal. [Callum] You right there? Yeah. I'll just wait outside. So what did he want? [Joni] He wanted to know about my relationship with Henry. [Zac] Why? Oh, I don't know, maybe he thinks I forged Henry's signature on the check and I whacked him over the head. Don't joke, Mum. They're lining you up for a manslaughter charge and you can't even see it. Don't be ridiculous. Any time anything bad ever happens to you, you just pretend it's not there. You dig a hole, you put your head in, and you wait for it to go away. You're an avoider, Mum. Don't you talk to me like that. Why don't you go ask your knight in shining armour why one of his business cards was on the floor of Henry's bedroom on the day that Henry died? How do you know that? Just go ask him.

[Ned] I couldn't leave the job half done. So what do you reckon? Well, I reckon you're a carpenter. Did you call Mateo? No, but I will. Did you know that our local doctor died? - Oh, that's a shame. - Yeah, Henry Forbes. Did you know him? - Oh, I met him. - Ah, 'cause I heard he had one of your business cards. Yeah, I was in there a few days ago for a prescription. Said he needed some help with something, so I gave him a card. So why did Henry need a carpenter? I'm a criminal lawyer. Oh. [sighs] Well, I can be a carpenter, if you... No, no, no, I was married to a lawyer. Oh, well, you can't get that lucky twice. Yeah. So what did Henry need with a criminal lawyer? He didn't say. Did I pass? What? Well, this is some kind of test, right? [ominous music] [doorknob rattling] Hi again. - Hey. - You're Zac, yeah? Yeah. Hi, I'm Ned. Nice to meet ya. Yeah, I know. I'm just cleaning the toilets. You pulled the short straw, didn't ya? Yeah. [cellphone crowing] [cellphone beeps] [door thuds] Hey, Dad. [Paul] Zac, I'm a little bit concerned. Is Mum okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine. Well, you don't sound all that convinced. Did the police say it was a murder? No, not yet. Hey, did you get that information for me? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Empanadas? No, absolutely. Oh, no, 120, won't be a problem. Okay, Mateo. Okay, bye! Hey, how do you make a bloody empanada? Relax, it's a stuffed pastry. Maize, beef, salt, bit of sugar. Easy game. - Okay. - Bunuelos? He said that's like a doughnut with cheese. Butter, yeast, ricotta. - Yum. - Too easy. - Next? - Chorizo. - Chorizo. - Sausage. We won't get them this late in the day. Moving on, arepas. Like a pancake. Corn base, yep, done. Okay, I'll get the table and chairs from Rose, we can borrow them. We'll get Steve to do a meat on the spit. - Pork or beef? - Both.

You know, I really hope things get easier for you. Thank you, the police have promised to keep me informed, so you never know. Maybe one day I'll get the answers I'm looking for. Well, might see you again under happier circumstances. Oh, I really hope so. - Here, let me get that. - Thank you. You've got a son, haven't you? Yeah, Zac, he's 15. Sometimes, you just wish they'd never grow up. [both chuckle] - Well, thank you. - See you later, Catherine. Mum. Mum. - Bye. - Mum. Yeah? I know why Dr. Forbes was murdered. Oh, darling, look, I've spoken to Ned. There's a perfectly logical explanation for Henry having his business card. He wasn't a doctor. - What? - Just listen, okay? Henry had two degrees on his wall. One was in creative writing from England. - Mm-hm. - The other was an Australian medical degree. - So... - He got them in the same year. I sent Dad his photo and asked him to check it out. God. [Zac] Henry was a fraud. Darling, your father topped the class in fraud. He actually wrote the lesson plans. Henry's real name was Henry Longhand Metcalfe. In 1990, he got 10 years for forgery and counterfeiting. Two years after he got out, he showed up here and set up a medical practise. Okay, darling, you know what? I don't believe that for a second because Henry was a wonderful doctor. You ask anyone in The Falls. Now, sweetie, why have you been digging around in all this? Because I knew the police were going to investigate you. - Me? - Yeah, you took the check. Oh, jeez, that bloody check again. Look, sweetie, I really appreciate your concern, but your behaviour is bordering on obsessive. Not as obsessive as your hatred of Dad. I don't hate your dad. Sweetie, come here. No, look. I don't want a bloody hug, okay? I just want you to listen to me. [sombre music] [Rosalie] I don't know whether Henry's coming back to us or not, but I thought I might be ready. [Joni] I think he'd really appreciate it. [Rosalie] Yeah, think he would. [Joni] We're having a party at the Lodge. [Rosalie] Bit soon, isn't it? - He's barely cold. - It's an engagement party. [Rosalie] Oh, anyone we know? [Joni] Friends of a guy who's staying there. Uh-huh. Who? Ned, he's a lawyer. Oh. [Joni sighs] What's he like? He's nice. He's a bit sad around the edges. Mm-hm. Sexy? Oh, I don't know. Oh, I think you do. I think you do. Anyway, I need the trestle tables on Saturday. Sure, sure, sure. Should be about 80 people. - Should be good. - Get the bank off your back. Oh, you know, I really hope so. I feel like this could be a turning point for me, you know, where I get some control back in my life. [Rosalie chuckles] You know what Zac said? Yeah? Zac said I was avoider. - Oh, rubbish. - I think I might be right. You want me to give you an example? - If you feel you must. - Okay. My marriage to Paul, Mr. Personality, you know, when we got together, we had so much fun. It was like I was marinating in him and everything exciting about him would just rub off onto me and I'd become exciting too, and I didn't. And after a while I stopped trying to be anything at all, and then, one day, he wakes up and he says I'm not as much fun as I used to be, and off he went, you know, like a lemming. Don't they jump off cliffs? I wish. I wish. Hi, Jack. [Jack] There you are, eh? Can I help you with something? Oh, possibly. We had a report in the other day about a bunch of base jumpers planning to have a bit of fun up here. - Base jumpers? - Yeah, you know those lunatics who chuck themselves off cliffs with parachutes. Yeah, I know what they are. What's it got to do with me? So you want to deal with it, or you want me to? Oh, no, I will. - Good-oh. - Thanks, Jack. [Jack] No worries. Is there something else? Mm, actually there is. We ran a check on Henry's fingerprints. Apparently, the AMA were onto him for fraud. He wasn't a doctor. Bloody crim. [bird squawking] I owe you an apology. I should have believed you. I just think I've got a bit of a blind spot when it comes to your dad and, you know, anyway, that's something I've got to work over. But at least we now know why Henry may have needed a lawyer. - Do we? - Yeah, well posing as a doctor is a crime, isn't it? Could provide a motive for murder too. Yeah, anyway, sorry. Listen, I don't want you to feel like you have to be secretive about talking to your dad. Okay. [Joni] So you talk to him often? Pretty often, yeah. What, like every day pretty often? Something like that. - Mum? - Yeah? Dad wants me to go to Adelaide with him, on a yacht. How long for? How long's that offer been on the table? About a month. You gonna go? Still thinking. You'll let me know when you've made a decision? Yeah, of course. Gosh, it's been a busy day, hasn't it? Yeah. - No, leave it. - Pleased to hear I'm gonna be less of an avoider from now on, so thanks for that advice. Did you take these? Yeah. You've been busy. Yeah. Okey dokes. Night-night. Night. [door thuds] Did the cops give you this? No, no, it fell out of the sky. Why didn't you tell me you had a criminal record? I haven't, look, no conviction recorded, see? What's such a big deal? I didn't even know base jumping in a national park was illegal. - Oh, you did, really. - No. Well, okay, maybe - I did know a little bit. - You know, if Jack or Callum find out that you and your bushwalking friends were planning to jump off a cliff, you could go to jail. I think that's quite a big deal, don't you? Yeah, I'd get the sack then, right? You wanna try me? Or would you rather reassure me that it's not gonna happen? The second one. Something a bit more tangible would be good. What, have you got like a parachute or something? Okay, look, if I find so much as a kite on my property, I will take you down to the station myself. Now, you have to have a little chat to your bushwalking friends, okay? [gentle guitar music] [men chattering] [Davo] Okay, Captain, what's the deal? Hey, there's been a chance of plans, okay? Because last night, there at Doyle's Gap, there was a rockfall, okay? So conditions are pretty dangerous. So as group leader, I've made an executive decision. There's no operation. [men murmuring] No jump? [Steve] No. Oh, there's lots of other fun things you can do. You know, there's a garden tour at Leura. There's the church fete. Oh, that's not till next week, is it? - No, yeah. - You could always nip down to Henry Parkes's grave. That's a bit of fun. Yeah, what about lookouts? There's no lookouts around here, not that I can think of. You mean I paid good money to stay in this rat hole and I don't even get a jump? There's always the roof. [lively music] [keys jingle] [door clacks] [door thuds] [tense music] [door clacks] [door thuds] [lock clicking] [ominous music] [birds chirping] [Rosalie] Oh, no, too cheerful. [Joni] What, isn't cheerful allowed? We're choosing clothes for a dead man. Just because some lawyer has threatened to bail you out, a little sensitive restraint wouldn't go astray. Okay, sorry. You know, for a liar and a fraud, that Henry, he was a very good doctor. Must have read a lot of books in jail. You know, he was there for 10 years, and a real degree only takes six? Yeah. Anyway, Whittaker Brothers say we can do the funeral as soon as we like. We've gotta give people time to get here... So I organised it for Sunday, and I managed to get the piper for the graveside. Moment's notice. - Okay. - And that gives you time to organise things at your end. My end? I thought we have a little arvo tea at the lodge after the service. - What do you reckon? - I've gotta organise a party. Oh, we'll be right. We'll be right. Hey, now, what do you think of this one? This sports jacket, what do you think, happy pants? - Hey? - Yeah, mm-hm. Who's Michael Reid? [Zac] Why didn't you tell me about Michael Reid's mother? Well, I didn't think there was anything to tell. She's grieving and clutching at straws. Yeah, but Henry set up a meeting with her. He had Michael Reid's beanie and now he's dead. That's no coincidence. [Joni] Well, what does the report say? [mouse clicks] Michael Reid. Blood alcohol reading of 1.5. No witnesses. Death by misadventure. Well, there you go. He was alone and drunk. Henry couldn't have been involved. Henry may have been a fraud, but he wouldn't have hurt anyone. So why did he have this guy's beanie? I don't know, but I think we should take it to the police. There are strands of hair in this. Sweetie, this doesn't have to be connected to Henry's death. I'll bet you it is, though. Remember what he said. The final chapter of a very sad and protracted story. And he thought of himself as a writer. Oh, my god. He wrote it down. - And guess what? - What? Ned Montoya's got his diary. [lively music] [car horn honking] [Ned speaking in foreign language] [Ned] Welcome. - Nice to see you. - You too. How are ya? Good? - Ned. - Hey, how are ya? Hey. What did I tell you guys, huh? It's a beautiful place here. Perfect. It's perfect, isn't it? It's excellent. Just what we wanted. Mum. How do you want to deal with this? [Joni] I don't know, I'm thinking. Ooh, that smells yummy. - Hey, Joni. - Hi. Had any more thoughts about the silent partner offer? Yeah, yeah, I have. Look, I've decided to come with a deal that's a little more comprehensive. Oh? Okay. Well, something that takes into account your financial status. Oh, right. Look, I know you're in trouble. I understand that the engagement party will look after this month, but what about next month and the month after that? 5% deposit, three weeks' settlement, signed and sealed. [Zac] You're offering to buy the lodge outright? [Ned] Yep. Oh, that's less than I paid for it. Yeah, but it's more than you'll get if the bank sells you up. They won't. Well, what if the engagement party falls through? Mateo works for me. I think we should do it, Mum. What? Well, he's right. It's a good offer. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, you know, you should probably have a squiz at the place 'cause I have made a few changes. We might skip the turret, though, you know, after what happened to your wife. We should have a look in the cellar because we've got a little bit of rising damp there. I just think you should see it. Okay, just watch your step there. Oh, it's all coming back to me now. [Joni laughs] So here we are. This is it. Uh-huh. Yeah, they really knew how to build houses in those days, didn't they? Yeah. Listen, I don't know if you can see it, but the damp's just over there. I don't know if you can see it where you are. Give me the torch. [Ned snaps fingers] Torch. [lively music] [Ned] I can't see any rising damp here. [lock clicking] Hey. - Hey! - Okay. - Go. - Whoa, hey. Do you think anyone will hear him? Oh, no, they really knew how to build houses in those days, come on. [Ned] Hey! [Joni] Good, it's open. Come on. Oh, god. - I got it! - Mum, fingerprints. Careful. Oh, fingerprints, oh, god, right. Okay. [ominous music] It's Ned's address book. Well, can't be right all the time. Shall we let him out? [Joni sighs] Guess we'll have to wait till after the party. Come on. [gentle music] [mouse clicking] [Henry Voiceover] It's night. And it's cold. The first real cold of autumn. And I'm almost asleep when the boys barrel through from the next carriage. See their mouths open and shut. Drone of their anger. This is about betrayal. [punch thuds] [punches thudding] And then I see evidence of a recent life, proof of a nightmare. Do I stay and tell the police what I saw or do I run? We're all of us, in the end, imperfect masters of our own destiny. Masters of our own destiny. I pick up the beanie and take the coward's option. Days later, I find that I am living within spitting distance of the young man with the Southern Cross jumper, he and I held together by the forces of mutually assured destruction. Oh, goodness. Wow. He wasn't a very good writer, was he? No, not very. So the beanie didn't belong to Michael Reid. No. Southern Cross jumper. [tense music] [train horn wailing] [punch thuds] Steve's a killer? Yeah, I know, Jack, I feel completely betrayed. He's been living under my roof. [Jack] No, but are you sure about this? This is the black beanie he was wearing when he pushed Michael Reid off the train. Bet it's what he was looking for at Henry's house on the morning that he died. Must have known that Henry was about to spill his guts to Michael Reid's mother. What, are you saying Steve killed Henry as well? I know, I mean, it's just horrible. I've treated him like he's my own son. Yeah, righto, well, better book this one up, Cal. Get onto the suits. Tell 'em there's been a development, all right? [people chattering] You know, I'd love to hear what he's got to say. Just leave it to Jack to Callum, okay? [Mateo] You haven't seen Ned, have you? - Oh. - Uh. [Joni] Oh, gosh, sorry... [Zac] No, I don't know, sorry. - All right. - I am the empanada queen. Oh, yummy. [Zac chuckles] [speaking in foreign language] [people cheer] [lively music] [speaking in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] Oh, jeez, oh. [singing in foreign language] [dishes clatter] [dishes crash] Hey, come here, you. [singing in foreign language] [woman yelps] [glasses crash] You go after him, Cal. You're younger than me! My money's on Callum. He does play soccer. [Steve screaming] [singing in foreign language] How well does he know the bush down there? Well, he was raised here, so you know. Great, he could be bloody anywhere. I know where he's going. So show the police where it is, and then you come home. Yep. [Joni] Okay? No, I mean you just come straight home, all right, sweetie? Mum, don't worry. It's an adventure. Bye, sweetie. [chuckles] [Callum] When we get there, you just point it out. I'll radio Sarge. He'll bring in Polair. - Cool. - Then you go, okay? No hero crap. [Zac] Okay. Do you like being a cop? It's all I've ever wanted to be, since I was a kid. You got the taste for it? Nah. I'm more interested in forensic pathology, specialising in morphologic diagnosis and immunohistochemistry. Oh, right. [lively music] [people laugh] Joni, where's Steve? He's supposed to be helping me with all this. Fill you in later. Oh, Joni, Joni. Where's that lawyer friend of yours? - Have you seen him? - He's inspecting the cellar. Joni, Joni, spit it out. You're as tense as a bag of cats. Look, Zac's in the bush with Callum, and they're looking for Steve. Yes, and? Steve's got this Southern Cross jumper that would seem to implicate him in the death of a boy a few years ago. This boy was like pushed from a train and Henry witnessed the whole thing and he wrote down a story. Anyway, looks like Steve killed Henry to cover up this other boy's death. Steve, that's ridiculous. Yeah, I know, I know, but I think it's true. Joni, I gave him that jumper. - What do you mean? - A week ago for his birthday. Someone donated a bag of clothes to the church fete and you know Steve's always going on about his mother and I saw this jumper and it was something she might have knitted for him, so I gave it to him. I washed it first. Have you still got this bag of clothes? Okay, which one is it? It's a light blue bag. Here it is, here it is. Got it. So what exactly are we looking for? Anything that tells us who this bag belongs to. Okay. Oh, Joni. Oh, god, it's Callum. Oh, no! [ominous music] [Callum] You sure you know where you're going? [Zac] Yeah. It's not far now. I knew Henry's death wasn't an accident from the beginning. Is that right? [Zac] All sorts of stuff didn't add up. Then the Michael Reid story came out, and the bits just fell into place. But if Henry hadn't written it down, you guys would still have said it was an accident. Guess so. And if Henry hadn't seen Michael and Steve arguing over a girl, I guess he wouldn't have had anything to write down. What makes you think they were arguing about a girl? It was in the story that Henry wrote. [Zac] No, the story didn't say anything about a girl. It said a betrayal. Well, that's usually what betrayal means. Isn't it? Yeah, I guess. Guess so. [electricity crackles] [punches thudding] [air whooshing] [electricity crackles] [thrilling music] [Jack] You know what, Polair will be here any minute. But he's out there, Jack, God knows where with a killer. Well, he's a smart kid. He knows his way around. [Joni] He's 15, for God's sake. - All right, let's... - Look, Jack, I'm not waiting. - We have to go now. - Just get in the car. Let's go. [Zac] Steve! Steve, it's me, Zac! - Zac? - Come on, we've gotta get out of here quickly! Callum's out there and he's got a gun! Gun? What are you talking about? He wants to kill you! - Come on! - For base jumping? It's not about base jumping, okay?! Come on, quickly, I'll explain later! Hey! [snake hissing] [gun clacks] Why couldn't you have just left everything the way it was? - Cal, just stay... - Just shut up! If you'd just kept your nose out of it, no one else would need to be hurt. No one needs to be hurt, Cal, okay? It's all over. - Jack knows everything. - What are you talking about? You left DNA all over the place. Yeah, but no one's gonna know it's my DNA unless you tell 'em. I'm not pissing everything I've ever worked for up against the wall. You did that the night Michael Reid fell off the train. That was an accident! - You shouldn't have run! - Can someone clue me in here? - [snake hisses] - Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus! You stay there! [Callum screams] What was that?! It was an eastern brown. A brown snake? Cal, just stay still, okay? I'm serious, we need to put a pressure bandage on that. [Callum groans] Cal? If you want to live, sit down. Come on, Cal. [groaning] Cal, sit down, mate. You take this. Wrap it round his leg just above the knee and not too tight. I'll call Jack. [cellphone beeping] [Zac] Was it the black beanie you were after? Is that why you killed Henry? [Callum shouting] [Henry shouting] [both grunting] [punches thudding] [bones crack] [electricity crackles] After five years, he gets an attack of the guilts. [helicopter whirring] Just because he's going down, he has to take me down with him? Wasn't gonna bring Michael back. Polair's here. Looks like it's your lucky day, Cal. [police radio chattering] [Joni] You scared me half to death. [Zac] Mum, I can't breathe. - I can't breathe. - Listen, promise me that you'll never go to the bush again. - Yes, Mum... - No, ever again. Promise me. No. Promise me you won't go into the bush very often. How often's not very often? Like once a month. Twice. Okay. But I can always go with you. [Jack] All right. It's getting a bit cold, we should head off, eh? Hey, Jack, isn't the helicopter coming back to get us? No, mate, no. We're walking out. - Go on, look after your Mum. - Well, I've never been in a helicopter before. [Jack] Yeah, well, you'll be able to say that tomorrow as well. [Zac] Oh, so how did the party finish up? [Joni] Oh, good, I hope. I left Blossom in charge. [Zac laughs] What about Ned? [Joni] Oh, god. - Didn't you unlock him? - Well, I've been busy! Hey, Ned! [lock clicking] Ned. [door creaks] [door thuds] Jeez. [Zac] He's undone the hinges. [Joni] Well, you're resourceful. Mm. Never venture into the bush without a Swiss army knife. Rule number one. I'm really sorry. - You know, about... - Oh, for locking me in the cellar for 10 hours? You managed to make yourself feel at home, though. Necessity is the mother of invention. Can I ask you a question? You know all that rubbish about your wife and about, you know, wanting to be a silent partner? You really just wanted the house. Objection. It was not rubbish, Your Honour. Yes, I really wanted the house, but the reasons were real. Well, I'm sorry, you're not getting it. Yes, I figured that one out. You know you can get 15 years for unlawful deprivation of liberty? Don't you need a witness? You're very clever. Thanks. This wine is great. You want some? [Joni] Oh, yeah, sure. [Ned] Mm. Oh. I got this in my divorce settlement. I was saving it for a special occasion. Cheers. Cheers. [glasses clink] Oh. [door creaks] Oh, hey. [Blossom] Thought you might be asleep. No, no. Do you need me in the bar? No, no, stay here. I just thought I'd say I'm glad you're okay. Oh, thanks, Bloss, that's nice. And I'm glad you're not a killer. Yeah, that makes two of us. I made a chicken soup that'll blow your mind, if you want some. Yeah, great. Great. So how about a kiss to celebrate me not being a killer? I'm not that glad. [gentle guitar music] And so goodbye, good doctor, a man we could rely on. Your door was never locked or jammed shut with a pylon. You were a doctor with a heart of gold and great integrity. You died too young but not too old to be our celebrity. Thank you. Thanks, Blossom. That was lovely. So, Henry. You walked into The Falls and into our lives and hung up a shingle and said, "Trust me, I'm a doctor." And so we did. Now, we might be a town of pushovers and soft marks, but I don't think our trust was betrayed. Dr. Henry Longhand Metcalfe Forbes, he delivered exactly what we expected him to. And that was compassion, wisdom, and respect. You wouldn't bloody credit it, would you? He spends five years looking up people's dates, making bloody fools of us all, then gets a send off like he's a bloody messiah. Well, Jack, if he hadn't have diagnosed that melanoma on your back, I don't think you'd be here. Ah, right, yeah. No, good point. Yeah. [thunder rumbling] [Zac] Mum? [Joni] Yes, sweetie? [Zac] The ceiling in my room's leaking. Well, curl up with me, darling. I'll get it fixed in the morning. Hang on, you right? Yeah. I thought we didn't have any money? Ah, thanks to the engagement party, we've got enough to get by for a while. [thunder rumbling] I love it when it rains here. Yeah, so do I. Have you thought any more about going to Adelaide with your dad? Yeah. I think I might go. I think it's a good idea. Will you come back? Mm, of course. I live here. You know, I think I might like to learn how to salsa. Gross. What do you mean? What do you mean it's gross? Think I might be quite good at it. Come on. What? Mum. Come on. - Mum, Mum. - Oh, come on. Oh, it can't be that hard. Did you know that girls love guys who can dance? [Zac] Dad said they prefer animals. - Oh, really? - Yeah, especially birds. - He's gonna buy me one. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - That's great, darling. - Now, listen. - Yeah. Watching my feet. Okay, this one back. Now, just follow me. Just follow me. Come on. Get into it, do the salsa. Remember the party, they were all dancing? This is what they were doing. Yeah. See, I can do it good.
