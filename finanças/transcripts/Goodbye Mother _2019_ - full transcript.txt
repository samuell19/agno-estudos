I don't know what's taking him so long. - Hey, is that him? - Where? There! The guy in the blue checkered shirt? - That's right! - Yeah! - Nau! - Over here, dear! - Over here! - Let's go! - Auntie Ngoc! - Nau! - Auntie Ut! Kim! - Cousin! And... who's this? - This is Ian... my friend. - Oh. Nice to meet everybody. - Hello. - Hello. Are you waiting for your family? No, Auntie Ut. Ian came with me. Oh. That's fine, let's talk later. Let's go to the car. - Has anyone called him? - Already done! This way. Ian's been in the US since he was 15. His Vietnamese name is An. An? What an interesting name! What do you do? - What is it? - He just graduated from nursing school. You're a nurse? Thanks God you're finally here, Van. Your mom's been waiting for years for you to be here for the move. Our family's been overwhelmed by the issue. Let's talk about it later. Show some manners, Kim. We're home. Finally. Quick, go greet your grandma. Let's get in the house. Mom! Keep your voice down. Khoi, give them a hand. Hey, Khoi. Mom? Mom! My son. Who are you? - Oh, I'm... - Mom! - Mom, I'm home! - Nau! Are you well? How are you? How was the flight? - Are you hungry? - A bit. This is Ian, my friend. Nice to meet you. - Let's go see your grandma first. - Okay. Mom! Mom, where have you gone? What on Earth! - Mom! - Grandma! - Mom, again? - You're going to fall, Ma! Mom, please get down. - Disrespectful! - Oh my! Where have you been? It's been days. You're exaggerating. You saw me this morning. - Disrespectful! - Be careful, Mom! You dare talk back to me? - Please come down. Slowly. - It's dangerous. - Now! - That's enough. Mom. Please come down. Brother, Grandma's up in the tree again. Thank you, ma'am. Leave it to me. Slowly. Careful. - Be careful. - Sit still, Mom. Mom, be still! Oh my! No need. I can come down myself. Gosh! - Gosh! - Slowly, Mom. Come down. - Be careful. - Help her. - One. - Help her. Wait, slowly. Fifteen, fifteen. Fifteen! Hold on! Mom, look here. Do you know who it is? He's come all the way here to see you. Grandma. It's me, Nau. Why didn't anyone tell me we were having guests? He's not a guest. He's your first grandson, Nau. Don't you recognize him? There, do you remember him now? Nau! Why'd you wait so long to visit your grandma? Mom, that's Nau's friend. This is Nau. You're mistaken. Over here. Where's the photo of Nau that Mom carried everywhere, Ut? Here it is. You always put it in your pocket. Here. Is that him? It's him. Nau! Cu Nau! I've missed you so much! So, so much. Why'd you leave for so long? I'm her abandoned grandson now. I was gonna get it, Mom. It's fine. Done. - Mom, are you okay? - What? Why're you breathing so heavy? I've been running around. That's all. Listen, Mom. At this age, you shouldn't work yourself too hard. Now that you're here, I can rest assured. Listen, the district officials have been asking us to hand over the land. I've figured it all out. I've consulted a monk. We'll do the exhumation before your father's death anniversary and properly perform the ritual at home. Okay. If you ever need anything, just ask me and Ian. There's not much to do, I can take care of it. The important thing is that the first grandson has to be there. We can't do it without you. Hello. When Grandma wakes up she'll forget everything. Listen. Van didn't say anything about you. That's why I didn't prepare anything. You just sleep here, ok? That's okay, I can sleep anywhere. You don't have to prepare anything, Mom. You're back from the States, at least you should have decent beds. Alright, get some rest. Thank you. See you. Oh, Mom. Wait. We have something for you. Is it in here, Ian? No, it should be in here. Don't worry about it. You can give it to me when you find it. Get some rest, okay? But... Later. Rest first. Van. Van. Did you tell your mother? - Van! - Huh? You told her already? Yeah, I told Mom everything. Gosh, we just got home! Why didn't you take your time? I wasn't prepared. Van! I'm kidding. I didn't say anything. I definitely put it here somewhere. - Sister. - Huh? What an adorable kid he is. He lives overseas but he's so down-to-earth. He got sponsored to move there. Here, he only has distant relatives in the Central region. Wow, you researched his background already. Of course! I'm very good at this. Did you put pepper in this, Ut? The fish looks good. It's good, but rather small. I'm afraid of their bones. What are you worried about? They can pick them out. Wow. So many dishes! Hi, sister. Hey, we haven't even started. I'm saving it for Khoi. He's been out delivering goods since the afternoon. Have a seat, you two. Come, have a seat. Uncle, Auntie. She can scoop rice from there. Alright. Wow, sour fish soup. We haven't cooked it for a while, right? You... live together in America? Every now and then, our Vietnamese friends get together and cook. What? You have sour soup and braised fish over there? Yes. I thought you don't even have rice there. - Mom's here. - It's Mom. Oh my, we have so many guests. That's great! Isn't it nice? You all came to see me? Mom, it's us. Mom, here. Your seat. Thanks, miss. Excuse me. Hey, this is my seat. Mine. - Get out. - Kim. Auntie, I've been sitting here. Enough, Kim. Sit next to your mom. Quickly. Stubborn girl. That's enough of that. Let's eat. Let's eat. What is it? Gosh! You're drunk again. Get up. Get up! Toan! Lift his bike up for me. Don't just sit there! Men in this family... I can't believe it. You and your father always give me headaches. God damn it. No wonder your wife and kid left you. Hey, sweetie. Don't hang out with those alcoholics. They're no good. You want to be up top or on the bottom? You want to sleep on the bed or on the floor? You pick. This bed is hard, you're not used to it. But if you want, today I could be bottom. You're right, it's hard. Nau. Your grandma insists on you sleeping with her. - But... which Nau? - But... which Nau? Now she has her beloved grandson, she doesn't need me anymore. There're yellow... There're yellow flowers In front of my alley My house has high walls Covered with creepers Mom. Hello, dear. Let me sleep with you tonight. When did you get that tattoo? A few years ago. There are many things I didn't get to tell you. Were you afraid someday I'll get amnesia like your grandma, and you got that tattoo so I can recognize you? Nau. I was a wife for a short time and a daughter-in-law the entire time. Luckily with all the family around, I feel less lonely. See your grandma and Auntie Ut? They bicker all the time, but they always need each other. Aren't you tired of being lonely? You sure you can carry me? Don't underestimate me. Hey. Who'd you used to carry on this bike back then? Plenty. So much has changed about this place. Back then, it used to be a big swamp on that side. High reeds. We hid away from afternoon naps there. - We? - Yeah. Me, Khoi, and the kids in the neighborhood. Then, when you were younger, you and Khoi were close? Of course. Back then, we went to school every day together and protected each other from the big kids. Cu Nau. Cu Nau. Cu Nau. Why do they call you that? It means "brown penis." Here they call every kid "Cu," you know. But why not other colors? Blue, red, purple, yellow... - but brown? - What are you talking about? But it's not brown. Or was it brown then? You're crazy! So gentle. It's soft, not gentle. Sure, soft. My mattress is soft. Your bed is hard. &lrm;He's running away! Here comes the princess. Smile, Grandma. Good boy, good boy. Come here and see how our family makes cement tiles, Ian. Want to try? Give it a try! Wow, you're good at it. That's right. Hold it there. Nice. Even better than Nau. Watch your hands. Watch me. What kind of dish is that? It smells so good. Wow, I have to say, you guys are impressive. You know how to cook? Over there we live on our own, gotta do everything ourselves. This American food... Mom probably couldn't eat it. I'll go get her some rice. Delicious. My grandkids are excellent cooks! Ian. Show me how to eat it. Actually, for this we use forks. But let's eat it this way to make it more Vietnamese. Twist, twist. Why is it so bland? - A little fish sauce will fix it. - Just eat it. So tasty. You're so talented, Ian. Oh. Taking pills already? Yes. Tasty. Sweetie. The other day, I saw someone kissed you on the forehead. Who was it? - What? - Who was it? Van. He came back with me. Because in the States, friends kiss and hug each other openly. Like this. Oh, is that so? I'll kiss my sweetie Nau then. Hold this. This is for you. Keep it. Spending money. No, you keep it. I don't need it. Silly. Who doesn't need money? Take it! Or I'll punish you. Take it. Hold on. See? Here, see? Get married. Get a wife and make me some great grandchildren. Whatever I have left, grandma will let you inherit it all. Alright? Okay? Gosh, you're my first grandson! Once you get married, all the land and gold will be yours. Alright? Mom, it's late. Let's go to bed. Yeah. Help me. Time for bed. Can you sing me to sleep? I can't sleep without your singing. I love your voice. - You sure you'll sleep if I sing? - Definitely. Ian. Quick. I can't hold it anymore. Ian. Van. What would you do if you had a lot of money? I'd travel. Around the world. And then? If I found a place I really loved, I'd settle there. Really? You don't like it in the States? Or here? It's not that I don't like it. We're just imagining anyway. I don't have a lot of money. I have a feeling you're going to inherit a lot of money. Because Grandma just told me once you get married, and have kids, she'll give you the entire fortune. You really believe what she said? Yeah. When do you plan to tell your mom about us? Let me see when it feels right. Don't worry, Mom will understand. If I fail the exam I'll leave home for Saigon. You have a very nice nose. - Kim, let's go. - Yes, Dad. Good luck with the exam. Where's your face mask? Hello? Yes, Tam? We can't make the delivery now. Is that so? Alright, let me see. I'll get back to you, okay? What's wrong, Mom? They want this shipment expedited, but both your uncle and Khoi are gone. Not a problem, I'll take care of it. - I can drive. - What? Drive slowly. I'm not used to the roads here. - It'll be fine, just go slowly. - Okay. What? Why 52 million? Including the last shipment. Look, the other day I paid Khoi already. What? He said you needed cash. So I gave all the money to him. - Oh my God. - Here. It's here. There's even his signature. I see. I'm very sorry. Then... Just this shipment this time. Okay. How much for this shipment? - Dad, the number is right. - OK. Van, come say hi to Uncle Tam. - Hi, Uncle. - Nau, - you just got back? - Yes. Did you bring a lady to introduce to your mother? - Well... - There aren't any ladies. If he even fancies anyone I'd approve. - This is not a time to be picky. - Right. And who is that gentleman? This is my friend from America. He's here on vacation. Oh really? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. So you're both seeking a wife? Get married, and settle down. Tell your wife to make a kid. Your mom can't wait to have grandchildren. Isn't that right, Hanh? What does it matter what we want? It's about what he wants. You're always like that. As parents, we need to tell our kids what we want so they can follow it. Van, you don't have a girlfriend? My daughter Lien is single. She's also looking for a husband. I think you two should get together. Dad, you're so rude. She's just saying that, but she actually likes it. Van, what'd you think about her? I'm sorry? Uncle Tam's daughter. I'm not sure. I wasn't paying attention. She's very lovely. And hard-working. I think she's a good girl. Gotta know the person before marrying them, Mom. What's important is having someone to share life with when you're old. You'll have children to depend on. So? It's been two weeks. I don't remember. Half a month and you've already forgotten? Uncle Tam has already paid, but there's no record of it. Do you have anything to say? You've got until the end of the month to pay me back. It's raining. Busy. Occupied. Yeah, right! And this... One, two, three! What's this? I love the changing of seasons Not afraid of the freezing cold This is for you! I love the gentle language of my homeland From the bottom of my heart I love mother's sweet lullaby From childhood I love to sing to my friends Who appreciate me Life's too short, why don't we sing aloud? It gives us faith to carry on Let's forget all the sorrow Let's sing together, friends... Kim, you've got to teach me how to sing this song! Auntie Ut, later can I take Ian home? You think your mom will let me get away with it? Our love in those days was beautiful Like a dream Our love in those days was beautiful Like a poem... How much for a glass? - Five thousand. - Four glasses, please. Right away. - Pour me a new batch, okay? - Sure, new batch. - Here's the money. - Just a minute. Guaranteed fresh. Hey, what are you taking pictures of? Auntie Ut! What's going on? He photographed us. When did he photograph you? You think he'd waste film on you uglies? He was photographing those people back there. Forget about it, we're family. - Khoi! - Have a glass and let it go. Don't make him drink, Khoi. You're being ridiculous. This is between us youngsters. Hey, you're saying I'm not young? Drink it. Let me... as tribute. Bottoms up. It's Nau. - Don't you remember? - Nau! Son of Mrs. Hanh? Came back from overseas! - You've got to stay and drink with us. - Exactly. Let's go! Brother, let's go home. Go home, kid! Khoi! Head home with Auntie Ut first! Let's go, Ian. Bastard, I'm going to let your mom know about this! Drinking all day. Let's go! Raise your glasses! One, two, three! - Cheers! - Cheers! Let me help you relax. - Don't come on too strong, baby. - Feeling better? Girls go crazy for guys coming back from overseas. Enjoy yourself. They probably don't have these things in America. I have to say, you're lucky. You made it to America, too much money to use. Us here, we're poor. That's true. But we definitely don't need anything from you. You heard me? You smell so nice. Hey! Cheers! Yeah. Why don't you go inside to sleep instead of lounging out here? Vicious mosquitoes, they'll bite you to death. I'm waiting for Van. Who's Van? Van is my friend who came here with me. The friend who kissed you on the forehead the other night? How long's it been? Tell grandma. Several years. Several years! That's actually really long. Tell me more. Van? We met each other in a hospital. After I gave him an injection and spoke to him in English, I realized he's Vietnamese, too. After that, we became friends. But Van is special. He's always by himself. Even when he gets sick he doesn't tell anyone. That day, I tried to call him many times but couldn't. So I came to see him at his place. His place was so clean, it felt like no one stayed there. From that day forward I hung out with him all the time. Why this sounds rather... strange? You two should get married. After marriage, deliver me tons of great grandchildren. Don't be like Auntie Ut. But... Van is a man. Oh dear. A man can't make babies. But I love him. This whole trip back to Vietnam, I'm not sure if we did the right thing. Why? You introduced the one you love to your family. It can't be wrong. Why are you home so late? Do you know how worried I've been? What could you be worried about? Nothing. You don't need to raise your voice. But why are you worried? I'm worried because you're with them. They're just friends. So why didn't you let me stay? You'd feel uncomfortable around them. You don't need to know everything. Is that so? Don't you get tired of hiding things all the time? Yes, I'm tired. I told Grandma everything. What'd you tell her? I told her you're my boyfriend. Good. Very good. You told someone who has no idea. Saved the hassle. We pray to the Gods to bless the exhumation of our family members... - Finally, it's done. - Finally. Four acres and they gave us only two lots as compensation. When you're free, come with me to the committee. Just go ahead and register. When you get married, you can build a house there. Two lots is still very spacious. Your wife and kids will be comfortable. - Mom. - Huh? What? Just tell me. I... I think your name should be registered to this property. It's too complicated to transfer it to me. What's so complicated? I'm a US citizen now. Vintage jewelry is so delicate. Not like the new stuff. But didn't Mom have several sets? There's only this one. No. There's another set with melee diamonds. Here, jade embedded with melee diamonds. Mom's forgetful. I was afraid she might lose it, so I kept it for her. Just brought it out. - Looks great, thank you. - Yes, Mom. You're such a nice person, ma'am. You bring me gifts all the time, yet I don't have anything for you. Two, three, cheers! Boiled chicken! Looks delicious! Your house is at the end of The suburban road The walls are thin, lit by oil lamp Waving in even the slightest breeze Thank you, Mom. At this age, I'm blooming like a flower Men waiting in rows to take my hand... Van, come here with me. Come on, get over here! Here, over here. Take this glass. Let me introduce you. He just came back from overseas. An American looking for a wife. - Tam, don't go overboard. - Let me handle this. Cheers, cheers. - Don't they look great together? - Think about it, Tam. Let me think about it, but it looks good. Drink with me. ...we wouldn't have been this lonely today There's no turning back now Nothing left for us, see you in my dreams Thank you, everyone. Well, to thank you all for your support, let me, Ut Hong, sing a song to lighten the mood, an exciting one to spice it up, okay? - Alright, the next song... - Ut! - What's up, Tam? - Let me borrow the mic for a sec. Let me sing just one more song to thank my fans for their support. - Duet! Duet! - Ut. You're a family member. You can sing whenever you want. We only have a few hours here. You're being ridiculous, I just want to sing one more song. Fine, you want to say whatever then go ahead! I'll just say a few words and then you can sing. Ladies and gentlemen. We gather here today for the death anniversary of Mr. Hai. But what's important is to encourage his only son, Van, to soon get married and settle down. Am I right? A big applause, please! Thank you, thank you. Van, come here with me. Come here, come on! Okay. In front of your grandma. In front of your mom. In front of everybody and the family. Now, tell us. When are you going to get married? Your grandma and mom are not young anymore, right? So, when? What's wrong? You have to let everyone know when you plan to get married, so we can celebrate and be happy for you. So, when? Well... soon. What do you mean by "soon"? Oh, I get what you mean. By the end of this year! Congratulations! So by the end of this year we'll get to drink his wedding wine. Hanh, these two look marvelous. We gotta plan it for them. - Wait, wait. - What's up, Mom? - Get me up there. Help! - Be careful. - Let me borrow this talky thingy. - It's the mic. Get off! Let me tell you all. This is very important. This man here will marry my grandson there. You see my grandson right there? They've been together for a long time. He likes him, but I don't... - I don't like drinkers like him... - Ut, get Mom inside! - Ut! - Drinkers like him... - Mom, stop it! - Let me speak! - Let me speak! - Mom, get off! I have to let you know... He's got to marry my grandson. Anyone who'd want to separate them has to do it over my dead body! - Gosh! - Stop it, Mom! - Let's go! - Take her inside! - Let me speak! - No more speaking! You've got to marry my grandson! I told you guys, never give her alcohol! Please continue. Well... I'm sorry, everyone. This is easy to clean up. Sorry, everyone. Son, come here with me! You all know my mother-in-law has senile dementia. She doesn't know what she's saying. Anyway. Thank goodness my son's here. All of the family's here. Son, tell everybody about your plans for the future. Say it aloud. Go ahead. Well. Hello everyone. I plan to settle down in the States and bring my Mom there. Please continue. Help yourself. Grandma's here for you. No one's going to pick on you. Alright? Don't be afraid! If it doesn't work out with this guy, just go find other guys. Plenty of fish in the sea. Look who's smiling. Put this chair on. Mrs. Hanh! Mrs. Hanh, where is Ngoc? - Where is she? - What's the problem? - Don't tell us she's not here. - What's all the ruckus about? They told me she had fun at the banquet! Why are you looking for her? Tell her to get out here and talk to us. She's been hiding from us! Van, go get Auntie Ngoc. What's going on here? Why are you here? I told you I'll deal with it. Deal with it? - When exactly? - What are you doing? Calm down! Tell me what it's about. Mrs. Hanh, she talked us into buying this fake medication. Who talked you into it? Ngoc! You're level-one agent. You knew they're fake, they're expired, but still sold them to us. I've spent thirty million on these. I've lost all my money! Think you're the only one who lost money? How about me? Why didn't you say anything when you earned? How dare you say that! I'm telling you, if you can't settle this today I'll call the police to arrest her! Stop it, Ngoc! Alright, I'll take care of this. Okay? Okay, I trust you! - You trust that easily? - What else can I do? - I promise! - Let us settle this, please. I'll wait for you, Mrs. Hanh. Let's go! What's wrong, Auntie? I've lost all my savings in it. My dowry... - Mom. - What's up, son? Everything's taken care of. How much is it? I'll cover it. I can handle it myself. Mom. Take it. You keep it, I still have some. DIABETES. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. What's wrong? Are you still mad at me? Then what? I don't want... here. What? I thought you wanted it. No. You wanted it. Not me. So what do you want? Just say it. I don't want this to be the only place we can be close. The problem is not where you want it. We're in Vietnam. Not the States. It's not like we can do whatever we want. You don't understand. So what do you understand? Tell me. I shouldn't have come with you. It was you who wanted to go with me. That's true. I wanted to go back with you. No one forced me. I didn't want to let you go through this alone. Ian. Ian. Open the door for me. I'm sorry. I'm tired, too. But what should I do? Mom's sick, Ian. She's sick and I can't do anything for her. I don't know what to do. Answer me, Ian. What should I tell her? Mom. Ian and I... You two are in love with each other? It must be because you lived there alone without family. No, it's not because of that, Mom. It's partly my fault. If I made you come back home right after graduation, you wouldn't have been like this. Mom. There's nothing wrong with me. Then how can you be in love with him? I'm sorry, Mom. Mom. Will you come live with us in the States? Where is Nau? No idea. Saw him strolling in the yard. Tell him to come play with me. You really care for him, huh? How about me? You talk about him all the time. Honestly, in this family if I didn't care for you, no one would. If I didn't have to take care of you, I'd have gotten married a while ago. Nau. Nau. Hey, the one that came back with Nau! - Is it him? - It's him! Stop right there! Stop! Why run away when you see us? Drink. Have just a sip. I'll keep this for you. Have a sip and we'll let you go. Have a sip. Hey, are you guys really in love? - So they're gay? - I knew it! It's no big deal. What matters is what his mom thinks about it. I'll keep this for you. Calm down! Go tell Nau to give me money to pay back his mom, - and I'll let this issue go. - That's right! You guys can earn plenty there. He's even inheriting our land here. I don't need a single penny! - It's not yours anyway! - What the heck? - Bastard! Stop him! - Beat him! Where are you going? Bastard! You want a piece of me? Hit me, huh? This kid is stubborn! Faggot! Faggot! Take it! Somebody, help! - They're harassing my grandson! - Your grandma! - What? - It's your grandma! - Who are you? How dare you! - Run! Oh dear! Nau. Nau! Nau! You incite violence even with your family! You ruined the beautiful face his parents gave him. Nau. Nau! Oh my God! Why the hell are you guys fighting? What's going on? - Khoi! - Van! - Khoi! - Van! - Khoi, what the hell? - Let go of each other! Stop fighting, please! Gosh! - Stop fighting! - Khoi! Oh my God, Nau! What's going on? - Get off him! - Let go of each other! Oh my God! Nau! What are you doing? Get off him! Brother, cousin. Are you alright? Let's go inside. Are you okay? What are you doing? Picking a fight in the middle of the night? That's enough, let's go! Faggot! Why'd you hit him? Did he say anything wrong? Your son is a sick homo. There's nothing to be proud of! - I warn you! - Warn what? - Shut up! - I don't shut up! If you were a good husband, we wouldn't be miserable like this! Please! Go ahead, why don't you? Coward! Dad, please don't hurt Mom! Stay there! Say it to our face, everyone's here. Tell us, where's the inheritance? Give us our shares so everyone can live on their own. What inheritance? What inheritance, huh? The gold and land father left us. Land clearance compensation. Were you thinking of keeping it all to yourself? I wasn't planning on anything. Not keeping anything? Are you kidding me? Ut, come here! Ut heard Mom say that we still had many properties. You wanna keep it all? Ut, tell us! Tell us! I heard Mom tell Ian that we still had many properties. See? Ut, you actually believe what Mom said? That's what I was told. How do I know? Anyone possessing property, bring it out so we can divide it. You all have someone to rely on. I'm all by myself, no one's going to take care of me. Give me my share so I can live on my own! Exactly, split it! There's nothing left to split or share! Nothing left? Where has all the money gone? Where has it all gone? Who crossed the border and lost all the gold? Who lost money for tontines? Who bet on football and made me pay the debts? Who? Who went to Phnom Penh for business and got involved with gangsters? Who? I knew it! I knew you never let that go! What? Get out of here! You think that I slept with other men, that she's not a child of this family so you don't have to give her a share, right? Stop it! You can say anything but don't touch her! Are you serious? Nobody mentioned that and you have to bring it up! That's enough. Listen to what I have to say. Father left the land for the first grandson. After the clearance, I got new lots as compensation. I'll build a house and move there. This family house, before Mom became forgetful she told me to leave it to Ut. The family business, I'll leave to Uncle Toan. I'll give it all up. Do whatever you want! Sister! I didn't mean to take it back. If you give it up, who's going to handle the business? Sister! Are you happy now? Don't let it get to your head. You'll be all by yourself when you're old! Van. Will you return to your mom? She'll be so lonely. Yesterday you said goodbye to them already. Now you're gonna do it again? Yesterday I was just visiting. Today is the real farewell. No, no more discussion! Please, Mom! I want to say goodbye to them. Don't go there all the time, people will talk. Big brother. She's grown up. Let her do what she wants. - Thank you. - Hey! Didn't even let me say a word. Goodbye. Take care. - Grandma. - Yes? I'm going. Please take care. Bye bye, Nau. Safe flight, my dear. Safe flight. Please let me sit in the front. Goodbye, Mother. I'll start the paperwork as soon as I get there. It'll probably only take two years, Mom. Why, Mom? We'll come back to see them. Right? Actually, you know what? Whatever happens I just want you and Van to be happy. I'll always be by your side. Toan. I need to get into the habit of driving. Press the clutch pedal. Slowly release the brake. Slowly. Prepare for the next gear, shift. Press the clutch pedal. Now release. GOODBYE MOTHER
