( Wind blowing ) ( Dramatic music playing ) ( Hisses ) ( Buzzing ) ( Thunder crashes ) (Woman singing ) That's the hotel up ahead. Hey, we're landing. - ( Moans ) - How do you feel? Good. You slept like a baby. Yeah, 'cause I am a baby. ( Laughs ) - ( Phones ringing ) - ( Elevator dings ) ( People chattering ) - Hello. - Man: Hello, sir. ( Speaks arabic ) - Welcome to the hotel tombouctou. - Woman: Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Dolan. Okay. Mmm. - Go? Okay. - Suite royale for you, Mr. Dolan. - Suite royale. - Yeah. - Do you have anything bigger than this? - ( Both chuckle ) - Thank you. - Enjoy. (Wind chimes chiming ) ( Birds chirping ) ( Ringing ) - Hey, Mike, what's up? - Woman: Really? Mike: Hi, Scott, I know it's pretty late there and I'm sorry to disturb you, but the payrolls numberjust came out and it was a lot stronger than expected. There was also some upward revisions made to last month's data. Uh, well, what was the European manufacturing data like this morning? And the Chinese figures overnight? Mike: Above expectations. The markets were slack until the payroll numbers and since then they've rallied a percent. Our positions are holding well, but we're within 15 tics of our stop levels. Uhh... all right, well, tell... Tell Nick to dump half the t-bond position. - Ho... hold on, hold on, stay there. - ( Clicks ) - Where are you going? - To smoke. No, you said no smoking after 10:00, baby. - It's after 10:00. - Well, you said no BlackBerry in bed - and you're in bed. - Come on, the office calls, - I gotta take it. - That's your choice, this is mine. Don't be ridiculous. Come on, tay. I mean, this is what I do for a living. What do you think pays for our lifestyle? - That rock on your finger? - Really? You know what? Take back your damn rock. I don't want if this is how its gonna be, Scott. - Come on, don't be like that. - It's our honeymoon, Scott. I'm bored. I want something in my mouth. If it's not gonna be you, it's gonna be something else. Come on, don't go. - ( Sighs ) - ( Door opens, closes ) Yeah, I'm back. ( Distant music ) ( Footsteps approaching ) ( Heavy breathing ) You're wet. And you're a pig. - Where's Scotty? - ( Heavy breathing continues ) Fucking his BlackBerry, where else? Mmm. - ( Gasps ) - ( Knocks ) ( Both laugh ) - Okay, listen. - Mm-hmm. We leave at 7:00 am. When Scott says 7:00, he means 7:00. Okay? Yeah, I know, it's fuckin' early. And he wants to go see some old abandoned fort. - It's like a two-hour drive. - ( Rustling ) And... Here's the map. - There's one road that leads there. - Uh-huh. - So when you see us pass... - Yeah. Just pull up beside, and... do what you're gonna do. And... what if he doesn't pull over? - Oh, I'll insist. - Oh. Trust me. I know Scotty. He has a hot-head. He'll wanna stop and get into it with you. And that's when you do it. Okay? Mike: The sec called again to arrange that conference call... All right. This is what I need you to do. - ( Beeping ) - Man: It's a GPS transponder. - Oh. - Just in case. You just slap it in your wheel well... - ( Chuckles ) - And let it go beep. - Now listen. - Mmm? Are you sure you wanna do this? Absolutely sure? 'Cause after tonight... There's no going back. We've come this far. Yeah, we have. - ( Unzips) - And I... I like to finish what I start. ( Clicks ) What are you doing? ( Breathes deeply ) I need to stretch. - ( Engine stops ) - Okay. ( Parking brake clicks ) ( Breathes deeply ) (Engine pinging ) ( Kicks tire ) ( Muffled music playing ) Listen. You hear that? ( Music stops ) - I don't hear anything. - Exactly. Not a sound. God, I love the emptiness. It's so liberating. I feel like I have a chance to get back what I've lost here. - And what was that? - Clarity. - Hmm. - Yeah. It's not too late. - ( Sniffles ) - Hey hey, are you crying? No, Scotty, can we go? I'm ready to go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. What's the matter? - No, Scott, it's... - Come on. ( Glasses clatter) You know what I wanna do? What? I want to make love to you, right here, right now. - ( Scoffs ) - Come on. No, Scotty, it is hot and dirty - and I feel disgusting. - Then let's go back to the hotel. - You're crazy. - I'm crazy serious. Come on, we go back to the hotel, we... we stay holed up all day, we drink bottles of dom and we eat caviar the way we fuckin' love. And what about those old forts you wanna see? - I don't care. - Yes, you do. I know how important that is to you. You and me, tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - What if there is no tomorrow? Oh, there'ii be a tomorrow. Come here. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - Okay, tomorrow. - Okay. No more tears. - ( Deep sigh ) - Mm-hmm. Let's go. ( Door opens ) - Okay. - ( Door closes ) There's always tomorrow. - ( Engine starts ) - ( Rock music playing ) J' liar liar, pants on fire j' j' your nose is longer than a telephone wire I I ask me, baby... I - this isn't the road, honey. - I'm tired of the road. This one'ii connect to the one we want about 40 miles in. Whoa. 40 miles of this? - Yeah, look at this map. - ( Rustles ) There's some old wadis... here. Abandoned quartz mines here. I want to see these. - ( Taylor coughing ) - J' why must you hurt me I I do what you do? I it's really dusty, Scott. I don't like it. Oh, it's not so bad. Don't worry. We'll be fine, we tepid explorers of uncharted lands! ( Chuckles ) Besides, it's not the destination, my bride, it's the journey. ( Man yells in song ) J' liar liar, pants on fire j' j“ your nose is longer than a telephone wire. I ( Folk music playing ) ( Man vocalizing ) - ( Thuds) - ( Gasps ) Jesus, Scott, can you please just slow down a little bit? - You're acting like a child. - I'm sorry, baby. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just feeling a little sick. No, it's something else. You seem pre-occupied. - I'm quiet. Is that a crime? - I know your moods, sweetheart. - What's the matter? - You say the same thing over and over and over again like you think I don't hear you. Do you think I'm stupid? No, I don't think you're stupid. Just, normally when people ask questions, they expect answers, tay. - It's called communicating. - Why... everything has to be - such an issue with you. - You know what? I don't want to argue with you, sweetie. All right? It's our honeymoon. Just breath, relax. Let's enjoy ourselves. There's nothing for miles. It's beautiful. (Coughs) I noticed him a few minutes ago. First car I saw in over an hour. Must be another road out there. He's moving a he" a lot faster than we are. ( Engine rewing ) So now we're in a race? - ( Rewing ) - Scott: Yeah. ( Honking wildly ) I think he needs help. You should slow down and see... Help? What, are you kidding me! We're in the middle of nowhere! - ( Honking continues ) - ( Rewing ) - ( Thuds ) - Oh fuck! Son of a bitch! Scott, please slow down. Just let him pass. Not slowing down. He could have a gun. He could have anything. - ( Taylor screams ) - Fuck! - Where is he? Where is he? - I don't know. I don't know. - How many in the car? - I don't know! I can't see! - ( Revs) - ( Thuds) - Oh no! - Hey, you fucking nut! - Hey, how are you doing? - Are you out of your mind?! That's all you got? Come on, come on, come on. Fuck! Sit back! Sit back. - I can't! - Sit back! Scott, you're scaring me! - Come on, you fucker. - ( Taylor screams ) - Slow the fuck down! - Scott: Fuck you! Would you stop the car, please? It's one guy. It's one guy. ( Wind blowing ) Man: Stop! Stop! ( Screams ) - ( Screams ) - (Gasp8) ( Creaking ) - ( Chickens clucking ) - ( SUV approaching ) ( Gasps ) - Hey! - Holy fuck! ( Chickens clucking ) ( Creaking, engine hissing ) ( Squeaking ) ( Baby crying ) Scott: Are you okay, tay? (Coughs) Is anything broken? - Taylor: Oh my god. - ( Scott moans ) I told you to slow down. Jeez! I popped my... My shoulder out. ( Exhales sharply ) Ah! ( Breathing hard ) Listen to me. It wasn't my fault. He was... he was trying to kill us. We gotta be clear about what happened, yeah? - We gotta be clear. - ( Crying ) Scott, you killed people. That's what happened. Look, there's blood everywhere. - Listen to me. - ( Sobs ) Don't fuckin' touch me. Scott: Hey, it's okay. - ( Man groaning ) - ( Chain clinking ) ( Baby's crying continues ) ( Man yells ) (Grunting ) ( Man #2 speaking arabic ) - ( Music playing ) - ( Pants ) ( Yells, choking ) ( Cracks ) (Grunts) - ( Baby's crying continues ) - ( Clatters ) - ( Woman coughs, breathes deep ) - ( Chains clinking ) ( Speaking French ) - ( Crying ) - God damn it. Woman: Help me!

Okay, all right. Move. Move. ( Grunting ) Oh fuck. - Oh fuck. - ( Woman speaks French ) - ( Groaning ) - Scott: Motherfuck... Fuck! Come on! - ( Shouting in arabic ) - Just fucking help! - ( Ayub wheezing ) - Scott: He's gonna die! Woman: Please, please do something. - ( Scott grunts ) - Woman: No. No. - Is he alive? - I don't know. - Taylor, is he alive?! - I don't know! - Scott: What is wrong with you? - ( Chuckles ) - Woman: Hey, wait! - Scott: Look, I can't help him, okay? - Woman: Help me! - I can't help him! - Please! You can't go! - I can't help him! - I can't help him! - ( Speaks French ) Please! - He move? - No. - Woman: Don't leave him like that! - What? I didn't see him move. I think he's dead. - ( Speaking French, grunting ) - ( Ayub groaning) ( Woman shouts in French ) ( Yells ) He's alive. The fucker's alive. Shit. - ( Ayub groaning ) - ( Grunts) - ( Shouting in French ) - ( Grunting ) He's fucking stuck. Hey. Hey. He's alive. Please, look, I'm sorry, okay? - ( Speaks arabic ) - Yeah. Yes, you understand? I'm sorry. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. He's stuck here, you see? - ( Slices) - ( Grunts) Ahh! Fuck. - ( Woman shouts in French ) - ( Baby continues crying ) ( Speaks arabic ) One, two, three. (Grunting ) Ah! Fuck. - Fuck! ( Kicks ) - No! Scott. - Woman: Ayub. - Taylor: Umm... - ( Exhales sharply ) - ( Woman yelling ) - What are you doing? - Falling in love. - Tay, look at this. - What? ( Baby fusses, quiets ) Tiffany chronometer, same as mine, same as the one you bought me. Only mine has the gold. Mine has the gold. It's... It's New York time. Five hours back. New York! - ( Yells ) - Scott: Yeah. - Wow. - Scott, people are dead and all you care about is where this guy's from and where he got his watch? What are you doing? What is wrong with you? Ah! GPS! - ( Woman speaks French ) - GPS. GPS? Maybe he didn't want to get lost. No no. It's tracking. Huh? Look. ( Panting ) There's us. There's him. Oh fuck. Taylor: It's... What do you think, tay? I think you're insane. - Yeah? - Taylor: Yes. You think I'm insane? You think I'm crazy? It must be the heat. Woman: Please! Fire! Taylor: Oh no. Oh my god. - ( Ayub screaming ) - Scott: Move! - Get back, get back! - ( Woman shouts ) Scott: What are you doing? What's wrong with you?! Help us! - Fire! - ( Ayub screaming ) Give me the blankets! The blankets! Water, water. Go get it. Move! Man #2: No! No water! We need it. Come on! Come on! Water! - What are you doing? - ( Ayub shouts) - Scott: Help us! - ( Screaming ) Ah! - ( Clicks ) - Scott: Will you help us? (Gun cocks) - ( Ayub shouts ) - ( Clicks ) Scott: No! - ( Grunts ) - Woman: No-oooo! - ( Grunting ) - No! ( Sobs) ( No audible dialogue ) ( Distorted thudding ) - ( Clangs ) - ( Chickens clucking ) ( Cellphone beeps ) - ( Sighs ) - ( Cellphone beeps ) Fuck. ( Beeps ) (Grunts) ( Chuckles ) ( Flies buzzing ) ( Mutters ) Fuck. Hey, you see that? Does that look like a guy out there? ( Baby crying ) Scott: Hello? ( Scoffs ) You speak English? Engfish? Is the baby okay? - The baby? Is he okay? - ( Baby fussing ) He has a fever, but the blood isn't his. Man: Hey! - ( Men speaking arabic ) - Who are you? Greetings. My name is saleh. What are you doing out here? My motorbike broke down. I came for the bus. What happened? We had a flat. They stopped to help us. Then he flew over the rise and hit everyone, killing those two over there. And a guy crushed under the bus. ( Scott, in English ) Hey. I don't... I don't know what the hell this guy's telling you right here, but this isn't my fault. This guy was trying to kill us, me and my wife. We're trying to get away, we hit this rise and... Look, it was an accident. ( In arabic ) Of course, he says that. He caused this. Scott: How far is your village? - Five hours. - Scott: Five hours. I guess we can walk that if we have to. Saleh: Five hours by motorcycle. - How'd you get here? - My motorcycle. Okay, where is it? Can you get us some help? - ( Baby crying ) - Broken, like everything here. - Dead? - Scott: Unconscious. He started driving into us a couple of miles back. Saleh: Why did he do it? Scott: I don't know. I'll find out when he wakes up. Woman: If he wakes. Please. (Grunts) Who is the guy in the burning car? He was my best friend ayub. The car caught fire and this guy took that... That pipe and killed him. - He was burning alive. - Bullshit. ( In arabic ) I did him a favor. - ( Crying continues ) - Shh-shh. Shh. ( In English ) Rock him. More like this. Woman: This cut here is superficial. But he has a concussion, maybe hematoma. Thank you. ( Sighs ) ( Cellphone beeping ) Anybody have phone reception? Taylor: No. ( Camera clicking ) - Someone's bound to see that smoke. - Omar: Forget it! This is a desert! There is no one coming to save you. What about the bus? Bus company is gonna send someone looking. There is no bus company out here. And no taxis coming to take you back for your manicure. If you want to get out, we do it ourselves. He's right. It could be days. - Hey, no! Whoa, yes, no! - Hey hey hey. No take a picture of me. I'll fucking break it. - What's your problem? - I have no problem. - Why are you so angry? - We need to get out of here, no? ( Taps ) This is our way. Engine's fine. We'll use the Toyota spare. Toyota spare? It's a different lug configuration, genius. - It won't fit. I checked. - Omar: We only need two bolts - to drive out of here. - Scott: And what about the other four? - I'll break them. - ( Chuckles ) With your teeth? What about the crushed metal? - I'll do it, yalala. - Yeah, you'll do it? - Yeah. - It's a stupid fucking plan. And it's a waste of time. So what do you suggest? We keep a tire burning on that Ridge, so people see the smoke. We conserve our resources, - spend the night out here, Max. - ( Scoffs ) We build a fire. We sleep in those ruins. - That's my plan. - My baby has a fever and no food. And he needs medical attention. I say we leave as fast as possible. Omar: Go through the wrecks, bring anything useful here... Water, tools, food. All of it. ( Speaking arabic ) We need to cover the bodies. ( In English ) And me? What can I do? We need food. Go catch the chickens. Hey hey, you don't talk to my wife. Don't look at my wife. - Scott, it's okay. I can do it. - It's not. You're not in charge. Well, someone needs to be. ( Chuckles ) - I'm your husband. - And? And I know the difference between a good plan and a bad one. Scott, this isn't some commodities deal. You really want to wait out here for the Moroccan police? You hit and killed a man. His blood is all over your rental. - ( Tools clacking ) - When it comes to shit in this country, I don't think you want to be on the receiving end. So I say we get out of here as fast as possible and deal with this from your office. What do you know about catching chickens, Princess? About as much as you know about changing a tire. ( Chickens clucking ) What are you doing? Scott: I told you... I'm gonna burn this tire. - No, you're not. - Yeah, I am. ( Cellphone beeps ) ( Flies buzzing ) ( Clatters ) ( In arabic ) You find something? What is it? Saleh: A body. What else? Nothing else. Omar: Are you sure? Something in the bag we can use? I don't pillage the dead. Move. Let me see. (Grunts) What do you do, bedouin? I fix things. What kind of things? Things needing repair. ( In English ) Jesus. Who's that? He was strapped on the roof. Wow. Looks like he was shot. No shit. I wonder why. - Omar: Does it matter? - Scott: No. ( Laughs ) None of my business. It seems to be the norm out here. ( Baby crying ) We need to get the baby and the wounded man into some shade before they burn up in the sun. Those ruins. - Can someone help me? - I can help. Thank you. ( Footsteps ) ( Wind blowing ) Omar: Push! Again! - Push again. - ( Truck clatters ) Help us. - ( Men grunting ) - ( Audrey coughs ) - ( Bangs ) - Omar: Ah! Fuck! (Bangs) Fuck. Fuck. ( Metal clattering ) ( Ratcheting, clanging ) ( Creaking ) ( Chickens clucking ) ( Clangs ) ( Mutters ) Fuck. ( In arabic ) Get out of the way. (Grunting ) - ( Keysjingle) - ( Engine sputtering ) ( Scott bangs on roof ) ( In English ) Hey hey, you'rejust flooding it. You're flooding it. - Jesus Christ, you're flooding it. - ( Speaking arabic ) ( Rattles ) Try it now. ( Sputters ) ( Engine starts, rattling ) ( Rewing ) ( In English ) No, shut it down! It won't hold! Shut it down! It won't hold! ( Engine sputters, stops ) It's punctured. It won't hold. I give it a couple of miles before it seizes. Maybe we could melt something down, you know? A wire, a piece of jewelry or something... Plug up the holes long enough to slow the leak. God, it might work. What do you think? ( In arabic ) Start it again? ( Engine starts ) ( Rewing ) ( Engine slows, stops ) ( In English ) It should work for a while. Son of a bitch. ( Door creaks closed ) Four waters for the engine and the rest we ration. - Hey. - A half a cup of water every two hours for those who work. Whoa whoa whoa, that's our water. You would have poured everything on the fire. I saved the water for all of us. I control them now, okay? And what about my baby? - ( Thuds ) - He feeds off you. If he needs water, share. How are you getting the tire off, tough guy? I'll do it. I'll fix this, drive it out and leave behind anyone who doesn't work. - ( Camera clicks ) - Hey! - ( Grunts ) - Fuck! I said no pictures! (Grunts) ( Cries out, sobs ) That's how you take care of a woman! Taylor: Scott! You're just gonna stand there and let him hit me?! You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you both. - ( Flies buzzing ) - ( Footsteps ) Come on, baby. Come on. Travis. (Crying ) ( Gasps ) (Snofls) (Crying ) ( Bangs ) ( Sighs ) ( Yells ) - ( Creaks ) - ( Laughs ) ( In arabic ) What? Something to say? Listen up. Maybe you don't like the way I look at her? Another man's wife. - It's not my business. - Damn right. - Where're you from? - El fecht. El fecht is 200 km from here. (In English ) Uh-huh. ( In arabic ) Nothing's in El fecht. I'm in El fecht. ( Omar speaks ) So what brings a repairman from El fecht to the middle of the desert? ( Rattling ) - My motorbike, sir. - Your motorbike? (Saleh, in English ) Uh-huh. ( In arabic ) Are you being funny? No, sir. Let's visit this bike. See how broken it truly is. It's a 2 hourjourney by foot. But if it serves a purpose, I'll gladly go. (Mmmm) You're either very simple or very cunning. (Mmmm) I don't wish to upset you, sir. ( Chuckles ) Do you pray? Are you afraid of god? Saleh, what does saleh mean? The man who can do. What can you do? Motherfucker... ( In English ) I can't find the release to the spare. I'll have a look. ( Chicken squawking, flapping wildly ) Here. - ( Squawking ) - ( Gasps ) - ( Snaps) - ( Grunts) Rip the feathers off, like this. ( Sighs ) Okay. Your hands have never done this, huh? - What do you know about my hands? - Give me. They like to be... taken care of. What are you doing with that iallah? Is it the money? Because it's not the love. (Snofls) Scott: You got a girl? I have someone I care about. Yeah, don't care too much or you end up like me. Scott. ( Exhales ) - Saleh. - Saleh. - ( Rattling ) - What to you do out here, saleh? Repair things, tires. It's simple job. You? I fix numbers. Yeah? I take big ones and make them bigger. I manage money. I run a hedge fund in New York. I take money from people who are very rich and greedy and I make them more. My wife is a beautiful example of that world. ( Rattles ) Look, you seem like a guy who can handle yourself. This guy is an animal. He's got a gun. Now if he tries something, which I think he will... I know he will... Can I count on you to back me up, to help me out? I'll make it worth your while. I think it's the only way we get out of here. ( Audrey panting ) The man who tried to kill you, he's awake. - Here, trav. Here, drink this. - ( Flies buzzing ) Look, he doesn't know anything for sure, but I think he suspects. And you wearing that damn watch I gave you doesn't help. I mean, how could you be so stupid, trav? What are you guys talking about? - Nothing. - Scott: Why were your lips moving? Taylor: I was asking him his name. Scott: His name? Oh, you'd think she would remember your name or at least take an interest in your well-being. - I know I do. - Get the fuck off! ( Scott chuckles ) You're sweating, Princess. I know you hate that, but it's actually good for you because if your body doesn't sweat, then your temperature'll go up to 106 in 10 minutes. - ( Sighs ) - ( Lighter flicking ) Smoking is no good... make your body temperature soar even faster, dull your concentration and that's when accidents happen and they happen a lot out here... a lot. And why is this so interesting to you? Oh, that's a fucking... That's a good fucking question. You see, when I was in college in the summertime, I used to... I used to tar roofs, yeah? You know that hot tar? It's a dirty, filthy, nasty business. But I learned two very important things: The effects of heatstroke on the brain and what people are willing to do for fucking money. - ( Lighter flicks ) - Money. Which brings us to this very fucking moment. It's Mr. Travis trimble, 138 east 32nd street, New York, New York. Born in... in Sydney, 1985, yeah? Came to Manhattan in '08 on a work visa where he worked for class construction, Rose to #3 through hard work and ambition. He's a hustler. But he hit a wall 'cause the partners, they... They didn't want to share in the profits anymore. So it compounded Travis's big lifestyle and mortgage problems. A couple of weeks ago he started some finishing-work in my beautiful tribecca loft... Which by the way I'd love to have you at sometime. ( Chuckles ) And that's where he met you, Princess, and you appealed to his sense of sex and fuckin' desperation. I don't know what he told you, but I don't even know him. - ( Rustles ) - Well... - Take a listen. - ( Beeps ) Taylor: Here's the map. - There's one road that leads there. - Travis: Uh-huh. - Taylor: So when you see us pass... - Yeah. Just pull up beside, and... do what you're gonna do. Travis: And... what if he doesn't pull over? - Oh, I'll insist. - Oh. Trust me. I know Scotty. He has a hot-head. He'll wanna stop and get into it with you. And that's when you do it. - ( Beeps ) - ( Chuckles ) "And that's when you do it." Fucking Nike ad gone bad. Travis works for me, sweetheart. Hello. He has for the last couple of weeks. Tell her, trav. Tell her. $25 million in artwork, and you think I didn't put cameras? Huh? You think I'm fucking stupid? You think I'm one of your stupid little friends? It's quite a show you two put on... In my fucking bed. ( Sighs ) Imagine Travis's surprise... You've got a great ass, Travis. We made him an offer. He jumped at it. You fucking asshole! You stupid fuck! - Ow, fuck! Get off me, you crazy bitch. - ( Laughing ) Travis: What's so funny? - What was I supposed to do? - ( Crying ) Shut the fuck up! Wow! Relax, trav. You'll be back surfing curl beach in no time. You on another hand, it's much stickier. Solicitation to commit murder for profit. That's five to 15, depending on your fucking public defender. So if this is all true, why even bother with the wedding, Scott? Another good question. Because some sick, self-loathing part of my personality still fucking loves you. Still loves you. And I thought maybe I could make you forget this bullshit... But I guess I was wrong, yeah? This brings us to reason two, which is conspiracy to commit murder transcending national boundaries. Now this is a much stiffer, sexier sentence. This is 25 to... to life, baby. - ( Hits) - Ooh. Ow. ( Chuckles ) - Don't be so angry. - Then don't touch me. Don't worry, tay, fed pen's not so bad. Beautiful woman like you, bull dykes will teach you the ropes, and then they'll pimp you out faster than a box of Marlboro lights. If I were you, I would take the... The cigs and the heatstroke because it's gonna be much faster. My wife. ( Clanging ) Travis: What is she doing? Embracing denial. ( Clicks ) - Yeah, right. - ( Tools clinking ) Scott: Where are you going, tay? The prison's that way! He had me followed. He tapped my phones. I couldn't breathe. It's like they all have this superiority complex. You know? Megalomaniacs obsessed with controlling every aspect of our lives. It's a man's world. They make the rules and use their positions and money to control us. ( Clears throat ) ( Baby crying ) I think he's hungry. I know. Well, why don't you feed him? Because... I can't. I don't make milk. Can I tell you something? He is not my baby. His father is a man I see from Marseille. He was in prison, awaiting appeal when his friends bribed a judge and got him out. When he learned his pregnant wife had stolen his money and escaped down here to have the baby, he went crazy. He sent me here to get his baby back. And... he sent ayub to teach her a lesson. ( Speaks French ) - ( Door bangs ) - ( Ayub yelling) Take him! ( Screams ) - Ayub: Grab the baby! Grab the baby! - ( Baby crying ) ( Ayub shouting ) ( Screaming ) - ( Ayub grunting, punching ) - ( Glass shatters ) ( Screaming stops ) ( Ayub pants ) Why did you help? He said his wife was a heroin junkie who gave the false evidence that put him in prison. He said his baby was in danger. He was worried about what she'd do to the child. He has a violent side. He's violent with you? With everyone. Why are you still with him? I was 15, living in the streets, trying to survive, and... he found me. Got me off the drugs and back on my feet. He's the only family I've known. I owe him for that. So he's been your lover for quite a while then? - I feel so powerless now. - Well yeah, of course you do. You've been victimized your entire life. Do you want to know what I would do? Audrey: Tell me. - ( Travis panting ) - ( Metal scraping ) We need to build a fire to cook the chicken. ( Laughs ) When the sun sets. That's our water you're wasting. - I'm sorry. - ( Cap rattles ) I know what you're doing, sweetie. And what's that, Scotty? You are a piece of fuckin' work, you know that? Oh, come on now, isn't that why you married me? ( Sighs, chuckles ) You know there's no way in hell I'll rot in some cage. Wherever I'm going, I'm gonna take you with me. - Is that right? - Yeah. How about we start with that account in Cyprus you set up. Why don't you give me the fucking water, huh? Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. - That's enough, a" right? - ( Laughs ) Huh? You think know my business? Cyprus. You don't know where Cyprus is. What... what do you think you're gonna... Your little fucking model girlfriend is going to take me down? What do you wanna do? You want to fuckin' kill me or you want to send me to prison? Make up your mind, sweetie. Oh no, I'll let the IRS and the sec take care of that one, Scott. ( Chuckles ) You know what? - I wanna talk to my wife for a second. - Hey hey hey hey! - Get the... I want to talk to my wife. - Calm the fuck down! - Hey, fuck off! - ( Screams ) - Fuck no, motherfucker. - Enough. Enough. - Stop it! - Travis: I'll fucking kill you! What's wrong with all of you? We have enough problems without you trying to kill each other. - Travis: Wanker. - We need to finish the repairs and get out of here. To do that, we need to get along. Now, please. Saleh: It will be dark soon. We need to prepare. Yeah. I'll build a fire in the ruins. Come on, sweetheart, let's get some stuff to burn. Dick. Taylor: I trusted you, gave you my heart, and you wore a wire like an FBI informant? Oh... what could I do, eh? He knew where we were, what we were doing... ( Chuckles ) And for how long we were doing it. Listen to me. It's not too late. We can still do this. Do what? Get out of here. Look, I know a way. - ( Scoffs ) - What? What? - Travis, please. Please, just... - Come on. - Listen to me. - All right. Say that... that he wanted to disappear, say that this was his plan the entire time. He freaked out when I mentioned that Cyprus account because that's where he's hiding the funds. And unlike madoff, he's gonna cash out before the shitstorm hits. And what better way than for everyone to think that you're dead? Think about it: Newlyweds in a tragic accident on their honeymoon. He just needed an extra corpse. Yours. It's fucking perfect. Listen to me, I know where he keeps some money that isn't hard to get at. There is no reason that we should have to throw away what we have. What we have? You know... ( Sighs ) I've met some pretty... Loony birds in my time but... Your fellow was right. You are batshit crazy. I hope they lock you up and throw away the key. Fuck. I'm sorry we ever met. - ( Engine starts ) - Whoo! - ( Chattering ) - ( Metal creaking ) (Grunts) - ( Omar screaming ) - ( Guard grunting) ( Man, in arabic ) Where are the other diamonds? In essaouira. Where in essaouira? ( Screams, speaks English ) Oh fuck! ( In arabic ) You'll take us there... ( Omar, in English ) Fuck. ( In arabic ) ...And put them in my hands or I'll kill you. - ( Grunting ) - ( Screaming ) - ( Chattering ) - ( Wind blowing ) ( Inhales sharply, speaks English ) Cold? I've been colder. ( Exhales ) I can solve your problems for you. Things happen out here. Then you'll come away with me. - ( Chuckles ) "Away with you"? - Mm-hmm. - You're serious? - Very. - ( Chuckles ) - To where? A goat-skin tent with a dirt floor? I don't mean to be rude, but you've got the wrong girl. Not so. We're a lot alike, you and I. You don't know a thing about me. ( Laughs ) I know what makes you happy. ( Rattles ) - (Pcps) - Give me your hand. ( Clatters ) Things like these. Rocks? Unprocessed diamonds, each as big as the one on your finger. What are they worth? Like this... Maybe 100,000 Euros. But cut and processed, 10 times that in the open market. And I have more. You've got my attention, which is more than most can say. Impress me, desert man. The baby... what's his name? ( Audrey speaks softly ) ( Taylor chattering ) - ( Laughs ) - What does she think she's doing? Descending into survival mode. And doing what we need her to. - Which is what? - Keeping him awake... Distracted. ( Chattering continues ) ( Creaks ) ( Scoffs ) Fuck. Well... ( Laughs) She's a real Jewel, that one. So... why did you marry her? (Sighs ) I didn't... I didn't do my due diligence. My research... I didn't do any research. I never met any one of her family members... not a brother, sister, uncle. She told me they were a" crazy. - ( Scoffs ) - She spun some bullshit that I wanted to hear and... I don't know. She's kind of cute. ( Chattering continues ) Like an idiot, I told her things I never should have. Fuck this guy! (Sighs) Can we just go over and kick his fuckin' teeth in - right now, please? - Scott: Oh, come on, relax. Relax. She's not gonna have sex with him. She'll toy with him, all right, but that's about it. How do you know? 'Cause she's my wife, that's how I know, Travis. She hates filth and germs and that animal is filthy. She won't touch him. What're the chances of them still being there in the morning with the keys in the ignition? They won't go anywhere. ( Laughs ) Stupid. Omar: Everyone up. ( In arabic ) What'd you do to the engine? - Nothing, sir. - Nothing, sir? Go take a look. ( Chickens clucking ) ( Rattling ) I'll try now. No, you stay. I'll do it. ( Engine starts, creaking ) ( Rewing ) So now, it starts? ( Engine stops ) ( Speaks arabic ) Don't fuck with me! First it didn't start, now it starts? What'd you do to it? Answer me! - ( Shouting in arabic ) - ( In English ) Speak any arabic? - I do. - What's he saying to him? He says that saleh sabotaged the engine so it wouldn't start. - ( In arabic ) Look... - Show me the problem! - ( In English ) Fuck this guy! - ( Omar continues shouting ) - - Oi! ( Shouting stops ) He fuckin' fixed it, all right? (Grunts) ( Gasps ) Turn around. On your knee. - ( Heart beating ) - ( Omar speaks arabic ) - Get down. - ( Gasps ) - ( Heart beating faster) - ( Omar speaks arabic ) Try calling for mommy to rescue you. Don't. They did nothing. Says who? You? Empty your pockets. ( Speaks arabic ) One hand, slowly. Show me what you have. ( Rustles ) Go on. That's right. Your jacket, take it off. You drive. Her and me. Any more problems, you die. - I said, take yourjacket off. - Keep cool. ( Men grunting ) ( Cracking ) - ( Snaps ) - ( Screams ) ( Omar shouts ) (Gun clicks) ( In English ) I found this on the roof. It's an Interpol arrest warrant concerning this man, whose real name is issam benhamou. Wanted for murders, diamonds and weapons smuggling. He was hiding in the desert in a little village in a safe room, waiting to go to essaouira then Brussels. But the police were tipped off and they sent three men to arrest him. Benhamou killed the one I found in the body bag and the two others arrested him and commandeered this bus to bring him in. You hit one cop, right up there, killing him instantly, and the third one was trapped under the bus when benhamou strangled him. Well, let's go. We need to leave. ( Engine starts, rattling ) ( Creaks ) - It was my phone charger. - Really? Yeah. ( Folk music playing ) J' this year's love had better last I j' heaven knows it's high time j' j' I've been waiting on my own I j' too long I - j' when you hold me like you do... I - ( Flies buzzing ) I it feels so right, oh now I j' I start to forget I I how my heart gets torn j' j' when that hurt gets... I ( in French ) My god! Give me the satellite phone. ( In English ) I can't go on... j' ( phone clatters ) J' turning circles... j' we need to get rid of this car before the police see us. Can I use your phone? Yeah. Talk fast. It's almost dead. ( Phone clicks ) ( In arabic ) Brahim, it's saleh. - Are you home? - ( Whispering ) I'm coming now. Listen... ( Speaking arabic ) Brahim? ( Wind blowing ) - ( In English ) It's dead. - Help us out? - Shouldn't be a problem. - Yeah? Good. I owe you, man. He would've killed us back there, all of us, except for her. J' when you kiss me I j' on that midnight street... I that tattoo on your arm... What does that say? - "The scalpel." - Scott: Scalpel? ( Chuckles ) What is it that you do, saleh? I told you... repair tires. How'd you learn how to use a gun like that? Two years in the army... Five years in white sand. What is that? What's white sand? It's a security firm. - Iraq? - Yeah. You were in Afghanistan too? Yeah. - How'd you get there? - They needed arabic speakers. They recruit in Morocco because we're not as involved. And I also had skills that made me interesting to them. Skills, huh? You had skills. Why'd you leave? Inside I was dead. J' off my feet I j' singing "ain't this life j' I so sweet?" I j' this year's love had better last. I ( Rattling loudly ) - ( Engine stops ) - Saleh: Wait here. It won't take long. - ( Engine pinging ) - ( Birds chirping ) What the fuck happened to us? I can't figure it out, tay. ( Sighs ) I'd have given you everything. Everything I have. Everything. Do you know how many chances I gave you since that helicopter landed? You couldn't stop yourself, could you, sweetheart? - ( Scoffs ) - ( Seatbelt clicks ) - Where are you going? - To take a piss. Is that okay or do I need to ask your permission? - Just stay here and talk to me. - I don't wanna fucking talk. - Just for a second. Just for a second. - ( Baby crying ) - Don't fuckin' touch me. Let go of me. - Stop. Stop. - Just stay. - I don't want to stay! - Hey, stop it! - Scott: Come on. Please! Fucking controlling bullshit, you fucking paranoid freak! Scott: Where are you going? ( Chuckles ) ( Speaks arabic ) ( Motorbike in distance ) ( Kids playing ) - Where is she? - She took off, man. - What do you mean? - What I mean is that she took off. You look for her? Yeah. She's gone. She say anything to you? Audrey: No, but after what I saw, I'm not surprised. What you wanna do? ( Sighs ) Fuck it. Let's go. Good luck, my friend. May god be with you. Thanks. - Hey, Scott. - ( Scott sighs ) Let her go. She isn't worth it. - ( Classical score playing ) - ( Birds chirping ) - My god, Mr. Dolan. - Hey! We were worried when you didn't return last night. Yeah, we... we decided to stay another night. Do me a favor: You see my wife, you call up to my room, okay? I've got a little surprise for her. - But she's already up in the room. - What? She came five minutes ago, then she went up. And she called saying she had a problem with the safe - 'cause she'd forgotten the code. - Call the taxi, yeah? - I sent maintenance to help her. - Yeah yeah. ( Sighs ) Fuck. God damn it. ( Car honks ) - Call me another taxi, please. - Right away. My friend, the taxi you called for me, the one my wife took? I need the driver. You call the cab company, you get me that cabbie's number. Do you understand? It's very important. - Yes, Mr. Dolan, right away. - Thank you. Thank you. - Is everything all right, Mr. Dolan? - Everything's fine. - Just make sure he does that, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. - Of course. ( Breathing heavily ) Audrey: I was living in Marseille. I came home one day and my baby and husband were gone. He's been threatening to do it. When I realized I had no chance of getting my baby back... - ( Baby breathing heavily ) - I was mad. No chance, not with the laws here in Morocco. So you stole back your baby? ( Guttural ) Hey. I did what any mother would do. Yeah, of course. And... how did you do it? I found out the... The town he was living in. When he went for work, we went in and I took my baby back. - From who? - ( Blows raspberry ) I don't know. The maid. - The maid? - Yeah. ( Blows raspberry ) A horrible woman. - She fought with us. - ( Baby fussing ) Ayub put a stop to that. ( Kisses ) Man: Mr. Dolan? - Mr. Dolan? - Mmm? - I found it. - You found a charger? - Yes. - ( Man #2 speaking arabic ) ( Beeping ) Man: He says she offered him a lot of money to take her to essaouira. But he wouldn't go, because it's too far. So he dropped her to the taxi station in town. Okay. And this... this road here, this... n9, this goes to essaouira? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. - Okay. - The taxi is there, Mr. Dolan. Beautiful. Can I have this charger? - I'll borrow it? - Sure. With pleasure. - I love you guys. - You're welcome. ( Laughs ) You're welcome. Wait. What's happening? Driver: It's a police inspection. ( Brakes squeaking ) - ( Parking brake clicks ) - ( Officer speaking arabic ) Registration documents, please.

No, he's with me. It's ayub. He's dead. A car accident. There was nothing I could do. ( Deep sigh ) And the cops? - I got away before they came. - Where are you now? On the road to essaouira. A guy's taking me and the baby. (Cyril, angrily ) A guy? - What guy? - I'll explain later. But he has got diamonds. - Uncut diamonds. - ( In English )whoa whoa whoa. ( In French ) Diamonds? Are you sure? Yes, a lot of them. Hold on, is he armed? That's the problem. Okay, here's what you do. When you get to essaouira... ( Continues speaking French ) Okay. Kiss. I love you. - ( Squawking ) - ( Boat puttering ) ( Chattering ) (Saleh, in English ) Is everything okay? Yeah, I was charging my phone. ( Sighs ) My friend cyril is already there waiting for us. In essaouira? Yeah. He has a boat. He'll take us to Marseille. He's invited you for dinner if you have time. - ( Baby breathing heavily ) - Great. Listen, we really have to go now.

The woman you stole this child from is my sole reason for existing. - ( Shaking breaths ) I'm sorry. - Don't talk. - ( Forcefully ) Don't talk. - ( Crying ) I have raised this child as my own. And when I saw his mother almost dead... ( Engine revs ) Odette! Odette! Odette. I made a promise to god, setting things right. ( In French ) Who hit you? Who did this? (Shouts in arabic) Call an ambulance! Hurry! - ( In French ) Don't sleep. - ( Breathing heavily ) ( Heart beating ) ( Sniffles ) Where's the baby? Where is he? - ( In English ) Do you understand? - ( Crying ) I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Shh. You know why I'm telling this? Because it's important for you to know why you needed to die. Do you understand? - Yes. - Say, "I understand." - I understand. - Now say... "I deserve to die." - ( Sobbing ) - Say it. ( Stammers ) Say it. "I deserve to die." ( Weakly ) I deserve to die.
