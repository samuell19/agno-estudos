(eerie music) (heavy sigh) I know what you're thinking. Pretty weird choice for a host, huh? Who better than a sneaky little bad boy rolling around town such as myself? Let me straight up with you. This is the kind of place it's going to make you feel uncomfortable. I can promise you that. You may laugh. You may get offended. Don't worry, that's the whole fucking point. You see here we don't believe in dreams. We live in nightmares. Still don't get it yet, do ya? Speaking of not getting it to the right of me is the Thompsons residence. On the surface, Thompson seems like your everyday all American young couple. But tonight that's going to change. For tonight... Is game night. (creepy synth music) [Bert] Uh oh. Who invited these guys, come on guys welcome in! Good to see you, good to see you! We got wine and stuff girls, IPA for the big man, and we got a bunch of chips. (group laughing and saying hello) [Bert]Basically used to be, but I don't remember being. I don't ever and I've seen any man. Well I can't do the math. - I can't do the trick. - I have the magic. (dance music) (everyone talking at once) (Woman guesses) (Group cheers in agreement) (dance music) [Bert] Uh oh. My turn? Right hand blue. - Blue. Alright brace for impact guys I'm bending over for this one, so... (group laughs) That's what she said. (group laughs louder) Who's she? (group goes quiet) (awkward laughs) [Friend] That's funny. Who is she? (people mumble uncomfortably) Are you serious? No. (Bert laughs awkwardly) Left hand red. (intense music) (muffled voices of group) - Goodnight guys! - What are you talking about? - Have a good night. - Thank you guys. Good night! - Bye! Yeah great, thanks for coming. You OK? - Yeah. Okay. [Party Goers Voice] That's what he said. (group laughing) [Bert's Voice] Who is she? [Bert's Voice] She. (typing on computer) (Peggy snoring) (Peggy snoring) (computer closing) OK, so I saw those curtains on Way fair, the uhm, the space curtains. It sounds ugly but it's not. It's really cute [Peggy's voice echoing] so I'm thinking the space curtains in the bedroom and then we move the bedroom curtains into the other rooms and nobody ever has to see it again. It's disgusting. Then we can move... (Peggy's voice is overpowered by white noise) Yeah, once we do that then. (Peggy's voice is muffled) (Peggy talking unintelligibly) [Peggy] You know what I mean? Anyway, yeah, so I think you could do that... (Peggy's voice disappearing) (muffled voice talking) (voice continues) (Bert laughing) (Bert laughing forcibly) (pained) Who is she? (Bert laughing) (Bert laughing maniacally) (intense music) (music abruptly stops) [Peggy] Hey honey. Uhm... What's going on here? OK, because you know it's one thing if you can't do the dishes, but it looks like you're peeing in jars so... (Bert laughing) Dishes... Oh, the dishes... Yeah, the dishes. It's what I said. What? Did you shit on the fridge? That's what you said. Excuse me. You said? Honey. Do you have any idea what I've been through? (Bert laughing) You know how hard things have been for me? Oh my God. - I've been having some ideas. Floating around in my head. Trying to figure out who she is. (laughing) Who's she? There you are. You... that's what you said. It's what you said. That's what you said, honey. That's what you said... - I don't know what you're talking about... - That's what you said! (Peggy whimpering in fear) That's what you said. Okay stop, please, stop okay. (softly) Just just breathe okay let's just breathe. OK. Honey look at yourself. What are you talking about? I'm sorry I don't know what I did. I didn't mean to do anything. I'm so sorry, Okay? (crying) I just want my husband back. Can I have him back? Can I just have my normal husband back OK? You're right. I'm so sorry. It's okay... (Bert sobbing) Well, I've been acting weird. (Bert laughing) (Peggy laughing nervously) I've been, uh, acting strange so... It's embarrassing. Uh. All right. Mid life crisis alert, I'm gonna do the dishes. Sorry about that. Uh. Don't know what that was so... (Bert moving dishes) Let me just... (Bert turning on water) (Peggy sobbing) No. No honey, there is one thing. About the dishes. I could use a hand. (Peggy screaming) - Get it in the hole! - Help me! - Please! - Get in the hole! Just get it in the hole! Squeal like a pig baby! Scream like a freaking baby! Fucking baby! (doorbell rings) (same time) It's game night. (upbeat music) (group talking and laughing) (group guessing and having fun) She has a fan. (woman guessing) No. (group continues playing game) (all yelling and laughing) (dance music) (music stops) (music restarts) (music stops) [Bert] I am she. [Group] Oh my God, I'm so sorry you guys... What are you doing bud? [Bert] I am her, she is me. I am always she. Call 911? Please. Okay... (Bert struggling and gasping) (Bert laughing) (Bert gasping) (ambulance radio) (Bert laughing) It's OK, honey, we're right behind you, OK? (ambulance siren) (doors close and sound abruptly stops) (Bert gasping and struggling) (radio talking) Alright. Your wife's pretty cute man. Gonna have to get you better, or I'm going to steal her from you. Heart rate is dropping seems to be leveling out. (Bert gasping) Sir, can you hear us? Sir, nod if you can hear us, OK. Looks like someone's coming back to reality. You're gonna feel a little pinch here on the count of three, OK? 1... 2... 3... It's gonna make you feel a lot better. How's that feel? It feel... It feels good. I feel good. That's what she said. We're coming in with a male unknown- (Bert screams) That doesn't sound good. See that's why I gotta stop taking these night shifts. I can tell you. Nothing good ever happens after 10:00 PM. Anyways. I'm hungry. (men laughing) [Host] This is Edna. She's full of dreams and ideas that never came to be. She spends most nights here crying alone in this dusty kitchen. Revisiting the better times of her memory. Pretty depressing stuff, huh? The only clear and constant thought that crosses her mind. Is if she only had a man to get through life with, maybe things will get better but only had a man to get through life with. Maybe things will get better. (chuckling) Trip to Aspen this year was amazing. So incredible yeah, we stayed at the scene. Yeah. - Oh my God I love it. It was so nice. (talking about trip) Yeah no but the spa's way better. It's way better. And Stephen took his clients there last year... (voices start to echo and become muffled) [Host] She didn't want to be here anymore. So she chose a bridge. She listened for a voice to stop her. But it never came. Only the daunting whispers of wind pushing her further to the edge. Then... when she least expected it... Something grabbed her attention. (Edna yelling) (muffled TV voices) (Edna laughing) (Voice on TV) Oh my God, that looks so good. Oh I've also been spit balling some names. What do you think about Ricky, hmmm? Yay or nay? (Edna laughing) Yay! Ready! Here comes the airplane. (Edna making airplane noises) [Host] She finally found a man to get through life with. Things were better. He was everything she ever wanted. A good listener. A shoulder to lean on. The strong silent type. The prom date she never had. She was so glad they met. I'm so glad we met. [Host] And although he may have been dead. For the first time in years. She was alive. (romantic music) Oooh. Can't even begin to tell you, how long, so long, we've been waiting for Edna to find a man. [Edna] Not that long. (Edna laughing) [Edna] All right, subject change, (ladies laughing) So... Ricky, tell us about yourself, what do you do? (Edna laughing) He's so cute, and so shy. Busy bee... - OK, you know what, I can't, I there's no way I can do this. Nope. - Do what. Are you? Seriously gonna make me say this right now. Mm-hmm He's... He's dead. He's dead. [Edna] Can you please just try and be happy for me just for once I would be happy for you if you brought a boyfriend along that was alive. - God. Can you stop? - He's not so. He's not. I get it all right. Please stop. - Edna. - You're embarrassing me in front of my date. - You can't do this. - Yes I can. - There's nobody... (Ricky's neck breaking) Oh my God! - No. - Oh God uhm. I find a man that I am in love with and you can't even be happy for me. It's disgusting. I would not tell her what is going on here, I... uhm... [Allison] Yo. Help me out here. Uhm... Well. Yeah, it's pretty disturbing. Edna. You can't do this. I'm really worried about your mental health. Fine. That's the way you feel. Come on Ricky. They hate us because they ain't us. [Allison] Yeah, that's it. Oh I'm so... sorry. Got him, there, okay... I'm never going to be able to come here again. So I was thinking we could go to don't know the beach or something tomorrow. I know you're not the biggest fan of water, but. I don't know. We could do a picnic or... (Edna song playing) [Host] They never did make it to the beach. Instead, she just stayed up for days, fueled by her friend's harsh opinions. In fact, the more time that passed, the more lifeless he seemed to become. Then once again, when she least expected. Something grabbed her attention. (song continues) (song fades out) (injecting syringe) (sighing) (heavy breathing) What happened to me? You weren't dead. And I brought you back to life. That was pretty cool of you. [Host] He explained how his actual name was Cider. My actual name is cider. Really? - Like the drink? - I know it's biblical. It means liqueur derived from the juice of fruits. Yeah, so like the drink. Sure. Uh... well... It's just, I've been calling you Ricky so... Ricky? - (laughing) Yeah. Man do I seem Latin to you? No, no, I just, always liked that name. Let's just stick with Cider. I feel like it's part of my core. It's part of my essence. Oh yeah, of course. I mean it is your name. Rename you that's crazy. I'm dying for a grilled cheese. Doesn't that sound good? Those are fattening. This place is really cool, but it seems like they're trying to capitalize on a young generation, revisiting vintage Americana, and I would think that would include vegan options to just show a nod to that generation. Hey, we know you, we get you. We know what you want. Oh I didn't know you're a vegan. No I'm not. But... You don't have to be vegan to care. (voice on TV) (Edna laughing) (voice on TV) What are you laughing at? OK, be honest. What do you think? My ho useless friend Vic spent two years collecting clothes and reclaimed fabrics, and we gave birth to this outfit right after our first experience with the DMT. That's exactly what it looks like. No, I think it makes my ass pop too. (record scratch) (strange beats) What's uh? What's this? Well, I didn't want to come right out and say it, but this is me. Really? That's you. - Singing... - Singing, drumming, strumming, producing. I spent three years of my life traveling with Russian hobos on the back of a cargo train and I wrote this song. It's about that- (Cider's voice trailing off) [Cider] Oh shh, shh, Shut up. Wait. This is my favorite part. This is the real genius seed. (indie music beats) Come on, look at what I'm doing. (music gets more intense) [Cider] Lower body. Lower. [Edna] Like this? [Edna] Like th-[Cider] Lower! Like. - Ah. Yeah, it's not really your fault, it's your body. (Edna sighing frustratedly) OK, ready, watch this. (music continues) (music slows down and fades out) (Cider dying) (Edna screaming and stabbing) (Edna song playing) [Host] It was then she realized she was never going to let her happiness be dependent on another human again. As he forwarded down that river, she realized that true importance and power of independence. The lonesome nights and string of bad dates were a dream compared to the nightmare she called Rick. But whatever the fuck his name was, as you'll see in our next story, we're going to focus on the power of friendship. Might want to grab some popcorn on this one. (Host laughs) It's about to get wild. (cocking gun) (woman screams) [Jimmy] 3 little piggies came to the market. Everyone get the fuck down. I said everyone get the fuck down! (customers screaming) [Luke] Not you fat boy. Get up. [Jimmy] We're going to make this nice and easy. You do exactly as we say. Let us do our thing and that's it. Do you understand? Do you understand!? Why you doing this? [Host] What a great question. [Jimmy] Dude you've been looking at her all night. Just go talk to her. Why do you do this? Do what? Push me. I don't push you. Luke do I push him? [Luke] You're trying to help? He's trying to help. - Thank you. Listen guys, I appreciate the sentiment and everything but I'm fine..I... I... I don't need it. You know why you guys do this every week after week. [Jimmy] No. Because you guys have settled down, we've gotten older, you've gotten comfy and listen, there's nothing wrong with that at all. It's totally fine, but you guys want to go talk to a girl like that. I don't, you do. Okay. And you project that onto me and it's... Wow. - I'm projecting? - You're laughing, it's true though. - I'm trying to help you out. What kind of friends would we be if we weren't trying to get you laid? You guys would be awesome friends, like friends that I would wanna come out with every Wednesday and do this kind of shit but this... tired of it. Jesus man. Sorry, it's just it's more complicated than you guys would think okay? - What's so complicated about it? - There you go pushing. [Jimmy] I'm not pushing. I'm asking a question. He's asking a question. A friendly question. - It's out a concern. - Stop being so sensitive. - I can't come. OK. Say what? I... Come here. No come here. I can't come. I've never been able to. What like never? Once. I came close. I was like 14. Was laying in bed and I. Figured why not. And so I. Was in the middle of going at it, and I heard a window break in the other room. And I got out of bed. I pulled up my pants and... Peaked my little head around the corner. There was this burglar. He was just taking a bunch of my dad's shit. Shit, so you're like traumatized, that's that's the thing I... I sat there and I, I watched him. I... And lo and behold, I... Was as hard as a rock. Wait, what? It's like the more shit this guy grabbed. And the heavier his... His breathing got. The harder I got. I was weirdly kind of hot. So like I said. It's a lot more complicated than you would think. [Jimmy and Luke] Yeah. [Chris] So shots or... I have an idea. (peeing) (something falling) (peeing stops) (zipping up pants) [Jimmy] Take it all, then let's kill the kid. [Luke] Sounds good. (men whispering to each other) [Jimmy] Should we like cut off his face and take turns wearing it? [Luke] Yeah. Guys I... I know it's you. Okay. - You gotta die now! [Chris] Can you get that out of my eyes please? It's really early. - Are you hard? - Nope. - You sure? - Positive. - Can we see it? - Nope. What what was it that didn't work? I can 100% see your faces right now. Well, that's super disappointing. (Jimmy sighing) I want to go, this is stupid. Okay. - Bye dude sweet dreams. - Yup. (intense music) Jimmy, this is getting ridiculous man. [Jimmy] We almost had him man. No, no, we didn't. We need something bigger, something better. Like what? Why are you doing this? Anything? No. (Luke yelling in frustration) What about this? No no. Fuck! The fuck! No! I need you to be fucking straight with me right here right now, is this happening? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know! I'm sorry! What? [Jimmy] Get down. (gunshots) [Policeman 1] KCPD! - Get down! - Put your gun down! Put your fucking gun down! (gunshots) (gunshots) Get on the ground now! On the ground, there you go! Don't move. Oh Jesus. We gotta guy down over here. (heavy breathing) I'm sorry. This was huge mistake. No. It wasn't. (dramatic music) We gotta go! Hold your ground! Don't do it! Drop the gun! (police officers yelling) (man yelling) (Jimmy yelling) (gunshots) ([Luke's voice) What kind of friends would we be? If we were trying to get laid. [Chris's voice] The best friends. The best freaking friends I ever had. (music crescendos) [Man] Hey baby girl baby girl. Yep, I just just dropped off my last package. That's cool. But hey listen, I got 2 words for you red box. Yep. Daddy is going to pick up a little flick and then he's going to give you a little di- Hey, let me let me call you back. (engine starting) (creepy music) (music ends) (wind) Hello. Kritika Express, I need a signature here! [Man] In the back! We're uh, we're advised not to do that, Sir. I just need a signature and I'll be on my way. [Man] Try and find me. OK... (intense synth music) (timer ticking) [Man] Hello. Sir. Wow. Yep. [man laughing] Just need a signature here on the package and I'll be on my way so... - We don't have much time, so I'll brass tacks it. Probably wondering why you're holding a package addressed to here, but with your name on it. (snorting) Yeah. Coincidence? How did you know that's my name? Look in order to not disturb the space time continuum, I need to be injected with your... with our DNA. Otherwise the chance the whole process fails, and then we're fucked. (laughing)What are you talking about talking about? I'm talking about the end la fin, vamoose, extinction in exactly 92 minutes and 46 seconds an asteroid is going to come down- Oh, I get it. You're one of these crazy desert guys, huh? You talk to lizards and, hang out in the sun. I don't have time to small talk with details. I'm you from the future and you're me from the past. And the only way to stop this thing is if you blast me with your DNA. (timer continues) What? - Oh come on, you think it's funny? Well, it won't be so funny when we're tiny bits of ash. All right, let's let's play, pretend and say I believe you, which I absolutely do not. You expect me to do what just, pull my hair out and give it to you. It's going to take more than that, buddy. Saliva. Close. Blood. Ooh, gross... But warmer. I think you just, need the sign for the package sir. Well unfortunately I can't do that. Until you do what's necessary. Well... Kritika's policy you can just pick it up at the office. Mm hmm. (man laughs) I ain't happy about it either, kid, but it's the only way to ensure the survival of mankind. (engine not starting) (engine not starting) [Operator] Sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time. Not one fucking bar. (hanging up) I'm you from the future. You're me from the past. (sobbing and laughing) (heavy sigh) You're gonna be okay. (sobbing) This... Come on, come on. It's unbelievable. - Well, if that ain't fate. I don't know what to tell you. Well it's not. It's not fate, it's illegal, you're kind of holding me captive here so... You think it was me. I've been here with you the whole time. Relax man. You hungry? No. How about a cold one? No, I'm good. So what do you suggest that I do? I told you, man. Look, I know it's a lot to take in, but with all due respect, I'm the one that's going to have to take it. I'm not gonna fuck you, man. This is insane. Well unfortunately fucking me is the only way you're getting out of here. And if you don't, you ain't going to have much time to do anything. Oh yeah, it's the only way I'm getting out of here. Well watch this. Oh well you know it's a long walk from here what you plan on hitchhiking, ha! Good luck. [Vick] This guy is fucking insane. He's a desert rat. That's all he is just a fucking desert rat. Full of shit. His voice is fucking 2... 3 octaves higher than mine. (sighing) Hey look, I know that seeing yourself living in shit like this isn't the picturesque life you imagine for yourself. But you know its got its perks, you know. You live a very full life. Sure, there's that little black tar heroin phase that eventually leads to most, if not all, friends and family cutting you out completely. But you know, that's what 25 years of delivering packages does to a man. Can you just please shut up? Please. - Sure. - Thank you. - Yeah, sure, no worries Hey, you know we got a birthday coming up. That's exciting. How did you know that? - I got a bottle of the good stuff in the Dome. We could, maybe do this thing black out. Nah I'm good man. I don't know how else to tell you that. - Okay, alright. All right. Hey look why don't we like I don't know ease into this thing. I could start like nibbling at your neck, or something like that. Stop please. You're so fucking weird. Are you not reading my body language at like... Can you just shut the fuck up please? [Man] OK I got it. Why don't we go inside? It's kind of cold out here. I promise I ain't gonna do anything weird. Absolutely nothing weird. Scouts honor. (grunting) Come on, it's cold out here. (upbeat children's music) [Vick] You know how I know you're not me? Your TV sucks. Hmm. This do anything for your big boy. Your... your nipples? No makes me feel, Pretty uncomfortable. - Don't knock-'em till you try-'em. I got a girl with perfect nipples. Waiting for me at home in a nice bed with, clean sheets. They're not always clean. What is that supposed to mean? Let's face it, you ain't Brad Pitt. She's a hot club girl. Tons of options. And that Armenian DJ that's always hanging around. (chuckling) He's a friend. - Oh wake up man. Who's in your Christmas card last year? So she's she's cheating on me now. Is that what you're saying? (Vick sighing) Why am I watching a children's show with a dirty bum, in a dome. What am I even doing here. Yep, I'm leaving can't do it. There he goes again, wait! - What. - Open the package. - What? - The package you brought, open it. You need to see what's inside. (zipper) There's no way. There's no way. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. [man] I'm you from the future and you're me from the past. [Vick] I'm not gonna fuck you man. This is insane. [Man] Well, unfortunately fucking me is the only way you're getting out of here. And if you don't, you're not going to have much time to do anything. Hey. Hey yourself. What are we doing? This is nuts. We're doing what's necessary. Let's bring this thing home, brother. (groaning) [Vick] Oh. (man moaning) (both moaning) (both moaning) (wind) (engine not starting) 1. 2. 3. (engine starting up) Fuck yes! Fuck yes. (driver gets out of the car) [Pizza guy] Meat lovers. Wild Bills! Pizza! Another day. Another cream pie. Let's make this more interesting. Yeah. Wow. Yep.

Could have shot you a text or something right? - Yeah! - Yeah or... He couldn't. I don't know do blind people text I have no idea. God, I don't know.

I said you just snorted my dad's ashes, So that is what you said, right? I'm not... Is that the joke name you call cocaine, are you playing with me? No actual ashes. I got-'em from the crematorium.
