MAZOVIA WARSAW FILM COMMISSION SILESIA FILM INSTITUTE KRAKÓW FESTIVAL OFFICE POLISH FILM INSTITUTE RE STUDIO presents a film by Maciej Pieprzyca Inspired by real events starring introducing Mietek. Come and say hello to Father. Come on. Let's go, Zenek. Wrong, kid. When you do something, do it right. ICARUS The Legend of Mietek Kosz - How do I look? - Perfect. Don't worry. "JAZZ JAMBOREE" INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL WARSAW, 1967 No one knows me anyway. All right. I'm going. He's staggering. He's drunk. Just look at him. Pathetic! Who's he anyway? INSTITUTE FOR BLIND CHILDREN, LASKI NEAR WARSAW, 1956 What a brave boy. Stinging? Hold on for just a second. You're such a brave boy. Sister... Do you have a husband? No, I don't. Nuns can't have husbands. But if I could have one, I'd marry a nice boy like you. Go to sleep now. - Goodnight! - Goodnight. Time to wake up! Mietek... Wake up, Mietek! Time to wake up. Come on. Mietek, what's wrong?! Mietek! I talked to the doctor. I won't lie to you, Mietek. Why me? I don't know. I don't know. You know what this is? You saw other boys use it. Will you give it a try? Slowly. Good. Good! What is that?! Can't eat my dinner! Hey, man! Play a normal tune, will you?! Please calm down. Let us listen. Mietek, the manager's here. Mietek! Nineteen. Nineteen. You owe us a fifty. Thirty for you and twenty for me. Gentlemen... You played brilliantly. Did I? I'm glad you liked it. I'm Mietek Kosz. You should come to Warsaw. Warsaw? What for? - To play jazz. - Jazz... Yes, I want to play jazz. And if you do... - I think you're joking. - I'm not. You can find me at this address. Goodbye! Marian Wolski, Vice-President of the Polish Jazz Federation. - Mr Bogdan, can we talk? - Just a second. Hello, I'm Mietek Kosz. - I'm a jazz pianist. - Oh, I'm so sorry for you. - Can I play something for you? Can I? - Sorry, I'm in a hurry. But I'm really good! Can I? Stop it, Mietek. He's already gone. Waiter! Get me a pork chop and cold vodka. Man, not again! Stop playing that! - For fuck's sake! - The manager's here. - Will you fucking stop?! - Calm down, sir. I'll handle that. You're fired! Stop it! There's a wall on the right. WARSAW, 1966 Wait here for me. Sorry... I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. So, we're here. What is this about? You told us to come to Warsaw. Try playing triplets. You'll have more space for improvisation. Let me show you. Move over. Hello, Mietek! - Hi, Lech! - Sir... - I'm happy to see you. - Hello. I've come to play jazz. I'm really glad. So, what now? The skies deny the rain to every tree. The skies deny happiness to poor people like you and me. Honey, this is the last night we'll ever spend. We'll part at the crack of dawn, that's the end. A big city lies beyond this empty steppe... Thank you! Thank you! That's not all. I arranged gigs for you guys. A big city lies beyond this empty steppe... The jury listened to your recordings. You've been qualified. There. Now you can play at the Jazz Jamboree Festival. 5 April 1967. This is my composition "Before the Storm". God bless you, children. God bless you! All right. Who wants to start? Mietek? Go ahead. Wait. Wait! Straight up! Look! Mietek, stop it. You can't keep playing that. This is not funny, you hear me? Mietek... Please... Red. Yellow. This is green. White. Blue, like the sky. Ladies and gentlemen, Mietek Kosz! Remember this name! Mietek! Let me kiss you! Mietek! You're the king! Warsaw adores you! Mietek Kosz, the great discovery of the festival. Who would you like to become? Poland's greatest jazz pianist? - Go on, don't be shy. - You know, I'd rather not jinx it... I'm ready. You're that blind guy? I didn't see you play, but everyone's talking about you. We've met before. In Kraków. - I don't remember you. - You see... I can't see, but I do remember you. I'm playing at the finale. Come and see me. What about the interview? I'm in a hurry. Certainly, I'm on my way. Five minutes. Wait for me. ...It's Danowicz. You know what he's like. I'll be back. He decided to play "Take the A Train" at the finale. And he just had to show off. I've heard this piece a hundred times. Every musician plays it differently. Some play it like this... "...others play it like this." "While I play it like this." While I... I play it like this. Then I saw Mietek's face and I knew something was about to happen. Thank you! I felt Mietek squeeze my hand. Gucio, this grand piano sounds so nice. Take me onstage. And so I did. Suddenly, he took the mic... And I play it like this... Danowicz showed up, a cig in his mouth. He almost dropped that cig. He looked as if he'd seen a ghost. And he said... What the fuck? And he had that stupid look on his face... - Everyone was amazed by Mietek. - That was just great! Mietek, why don't you play at our wedding? That's big news. Great! Yes, wonderful news. When is the wedding? - We must celebrate it. - Gucio, didn't you tell them? The wedding's in a month. We're going back to Kraków. Not everyone is as talented as you are. Those less talented like me have to play at bars and weddings. - Just to get by. - What nonsense is this? You didn't tell them? Basia is pregnant. - Congratulations, Basia. - Thank you. Give me one, I'll have a drink too. - Pour one for me. - But you don't drink. I am now. - My friend's getting married. - All right, here. To the newlyweds! Mietek, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you before, but... I understand you. I understand you. Go. I'll be fine without you. Just go. Go now! I'll be fine. I'll be fine without you. I don't need anything. I don't need anyone. MUSIC SCHOOL, KRAKÓW, 1963 - Was it good? - It was. No, it wasn't. Listen, Mietek. You're technically brilliant. - Brilliant. - That's good. Yes, that's good. Technical skills are important, but they aren't the most important. It's only one half. The other half is here. You have to forget about the keys. Forget? Forget and play. You have to set it free. What exactly? You will know once you do. What if I don't? Then you'll simply be a good pianist. But if you do, you'll be one of a kind. Wait, I don't get it. What's higher: a nine or a jack? A face card or a number? How am I supposed to know that? - Guys, who's this? - Bill Evans. A number's lower. The way he's playing... That's weird. He's not playing, he's improvising. Improvising... The country boy doesn't know what improvisation is. Guys, a record like this... Is it expensive? - You can't afford it. - Well, actually... - Mietek... - Yes? You can have it for free. If you walk on the windowsill. - Leave him be. - What? - Let's play. - Are you his nanny or what? - Do you have a problem with me? - Do you?! Go ahead! You were going to explain the rules to me. Hey! Look at him! Mietek, don't move. Right, the record! My record. Give me that. Give him the record. He's won it. Do you know what you're doing? Who are you going to be? Who do you want to be? Are you going to play in clubs and restaurants? People will be eating and drinking while you'll be playing? And you'll be drinking too? Think twice. Because you live only once. You might win the Chopin Festival! But you're doing this! Krzysztof Komeda, a brilliant Polish pianist and composer died last week. This is a tribute to him. MONTREUX JAZZ FESTIVAL, 1969 You won the first prize for the second place. Why is that? Mietek, he's giving you his award! "I'll never be that good." That's what he said. Mietek, you met Bill Evans. What did he say about your music? Wait... Here. Apparently, you were able to find a common language. Actually, yes... Yes, that's what you can call it. This record made me who I am today. Could you please...? You played in Paris at the Camelot Club. You had glowing reviews in the European press. How does it make you feel? Are you happy? Actually, I don't know. I don't know what to say. Bravo! Great concert. - Really fantastic. - Tomek! Hi... What you're saying makes me happy. Good to see you. Mietek, if you play so well, you must score nice girls after concerts, huh? Cut it out, Tomek. Easy, I don't mind it. I can fix you up if you want. - Cut it out. - Why? He's a normal guy, right? - Piotrek will take you home tonight. - Who? Piotrek will be here in half an hour. Guys, why don't you stay and have a drink with me? Sorry, I can't. - You played well today. - Thanks! - See you, Mietek. - Thanks for coming, Tomek! I'm off now. Thanks for tonight. - Is she pretty? - We're going dancing. Sure, let's go! Where? I was joking. Off you go! - It's not like we're dying tonight. - You played well. We're closing, Mietek. Yes, of course. Piotrek will come and get me. You know what? I'll have another glass of wine. And something for you... Cognac? It's on me. Here. Keep the change. Hotta hotta chocolatta... Hotta hotta chocolatta, pick 'er up and drink 'er down! Hotta hotta chocolatta... Hotta hotta chocolatta... You're bringing dirt in! Mietek... Hotta hotta... Hotta hotta! ANTONIÓWKA NEAR ZAMOŚĆ, 1956 Wrong, kid. When you do something, do it right. Remember, clothes make the man. If you had brought him here three months ago, I would have saved seventy percent of his sight. Jesus... "I am writing to request..." "illiterate mother" I'll take you to your room. 21 October 1971. This is my composition "Illusion". A solo pianist is good for Warsaw, not for provincial towns... - Even someone as good as you. - But I play solo only. You wanted a tour and a record... - I'm not cut out for that. - She's a nice girl, give her a chance. Meet Zuza. Hello. I'm still wondering if I can play with you. I'm an outstanding jazz pianist, while you sing some bits and pieces, right? And I'm supposed to play along? I'm really h-h-happy to meet you. - I was... - Great, just great! Great! Congratulations! The blind and the stutterer. When she sings, does she stutter too? - I don't. - Zuza, I'm sorry. Come here, let me see you. I can't perform with an ugly woman. Are you pretty? - I'm fat and cross-eyed. - No... I can see you're a tall blonde. Your eyes are... ...probably blue. I must touch you to be sure. How do you know that? I see everything. I just pretend I don't. That's perfect! Mietek! Hit the road, Jack! Let's have a rehearsal, come on. - It's five in the morning. - What? It's five in the morning. What's wrong? Nothing. I just want to sit at the piano. Can you take me there? Let me get dressed. Shh... Stop it. Quiet. Quiet... Come upstairs... Fuck off. Technical skills are important, but they aren't the most important. You have to forget you're singing. Don't be afraid to fly up. The world will lift you, the music will lift you. Don't be scared. I will catch you. And what will happen then? Zuza, look! Outside the window! - What is it? - Look at that! It's all so green. Mietek... I wish I could see you now. I wish I could see you now. - You still can. My hair. - It's so soft... - You already know it's blond. - Really soft. I have a mole here. Here's a mark. - A scar, actually. - Did you trip and fall? I got punched in the face. By a friend of mine. I stole her boyfriend. I was a bitch. Well, the guys told me you had great breasts. You want to touch them? Wow, they're so firm! Fortunately, they are. Zuza, do you have a husband? That's the last thing I need. But I'm no fucking virgin either. Mietek... No. Because I'm blind? It's n-n-not that. That doesn't matter at all. We work together, you know? Why s-s-spoil it? You're making me so nervous that I stutter like crazy. Mietek... I won't go to bed with you. But I can do a shot. To your health. Here. Good evening. Here's the thing. - What do you need? - Got a client. - You? - No, a friend of mine. - He's blind. - You fucking nuts? Talk to her. - A brunette. - No, she has to be a blonde. No fucking difference. You can't see anyway! No! I want a blonde. He wants a blonde. And I want dollars. - You got dollars? Dollars? - Yes! - Done. - I won't take less than ten. How much have you got? - Twelve. - Twelve? We've got ten. Just come and get me in an hour. Get inside! Good evening, I'm Mietek Kosz. A jazz pianist. No eavesdropping! Could you please go now, ma'am? - To your beautiful city! - No, to first-name terms! Cheers! - I'm Emilian. - I'm Zuza. - Emilian. - Zuza. - Emilian! - Zuza! Another shot! Cheers! Hey, artist! What are you doing?! You're gonna fall down! Easy, man! Calm down... Easy... Don't pull me or I'm gonna fall down! All right, I'm on the floor! Are you out of your mind? - What was that? - What do you think? I won't go to bed with you, but... we can do a shot, right? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mietek Kosz! Bravo, bravo, bravo! Thank you! The second artist who's going to perform tonight, especially for you, Mister Jazz Bogdan Danowicz! Bravo, bravo, bravo! Welcome! Would you please take your seat? And now, our dear audience in the studio and at home will listen to Mietek Kosz performing the song "Happy as a Lark". "LIVE SHOW: SILENCE!" You're a prick. That was mad! My fingers are still fucking trembling! I can barely hold a cig. You played well. Really well. - So... - See that chick over there? - Where? - On your right. Oh man... So, are we friends now? I can say this only to you. I'm running away. I have a concert in the USA. I'm going to stay there. - You can come with me. - Do you speak English at all? And that's enough. They'll look at your talent only. - Hello? - Zuza? So good to hear you. Come and see me now! I've composed a piece for my album. I'm sorry, I'm going out now. I can't see you, love. I'm meeting a friend of mine. The taxi's waiting. I'll drop by this week. Bye. - Hello? - Marian? Good to hear you. Come over! - What's wrong? - I've composed a new piece. You must listen to it. Come over! Fantastic! You must play it for me. I can't see you right now, we're having some people over. You must play it for me. I can't wait to hear it! Man, I'm really happy for you. Bye! - Professor, it's me. - Mietek? What a surprise! Are you in Kraków? No, I'm in Warsaw. I haven't heard from you for so long. - I wanted to... - Concerts, festivals, awards... I've read press articles about you. You play what you want. I'm very proud of you. - How are you doing, dear boy? - Well, I'm doing just fine. Are you really fine, Mietek? Yes... I wanted to... I wanted to thank you, Professor. For everything. Thank you. I am happy. Mietek... You know what the doctor told me? No coffee, no sweets. What should my life be like? Short. Hey! Come here for a second. Come here! Bravo, Maestro! And now... No booze, no jazz! Bravo. Fine, I'll write songs for your album. Zuza, you're my inspiration. Let's have a drink. An eight-month tour in the Soviet Union. - This is a huge chance for me. - Eight months... All right, you're going with me. - Where? - America. I talked to Danowicz. We'll go to America. What are you saying, Mietek? - This is our chance. - The blind and the stutterer in America? You can't even go shopping alone. - Zuza, America! - No, Mietek. No. You were supposed to sing on my album. - I have something for you. - Zuza, please... What's going on? I want to know what's going on! Please, stay. Don't do this to me. Please, don't go. I'm begging you. Don't do this to me. Don't go... Let go of me! Don't go. Zuza, please. For the last time... Stop! What the hell is this?! - What are you doing? - What the hell is this? Marek's new song. He wants me to sing with him. No, no. I say no. Who are you to say no? Am I your w-w-wife? Or your l-l-lover? Y-y-you're more than a lover. Because I play with you! You've gone too far! Who are you? I have created you! I have created you, bitch... I'm gonna play with the biggest stars in the world! I don't need you, I don't need you! WARSAW, 1972 Stop, stop! Włodek, why are you playing so badly? Tell me why you're doing this to me. I'm playing what I hear. Didn't you hear me play an augmented fifth? Where is it? I have just played it. This is a perfect fifth. And this is augmented. Didn't you hear that? I can't keep up with you. This is a fucking perfect fifth! And this is augmented! - I can't keep up! - Mietek, it's not a big problem. We're recording an album here, but you're banging out like a band of amateurs. - Let's play. - No. We'll play when Włodek learns how to play. If you're tone-deaf, then don't fucking play! Just don't! You're lucky that... Stand up! Hey... Get up! Come on, hit me! Are you scared of a cripple? Get up! You're fired. Both of you. It took me ages to get you this record deal. "A blind jazzman, who's gonna listen to that?" Jesus, it's so touching. But you're trying to fuck it up. Should I kiss your ass to thank you for that? Maybe you should. Fine, that's fine. Pull your trousers down. Come on. I want to kiss your ass. - No, no... - Pull them down! - I'm serious! - Here, have a seat. Listen to me. I'll find you another band. The last one. But you must swear you will calm down. Do you swear? The first time I heard Mietek I knew he was good. But I didn't know he was a piano genius. He is a real genius. The release date of his first album is an important day for Mietek, for his career... The album is titled "Reminiscence". Maestro! This way... This is an important, painful album. Please welcome, Mietek Kosz! Mietek Kosz! - He looks like a bum... - Terrible! Mietek Kosz and his album! Would you like to say something? The cover looks really nice. Bravo! What's wrong with him? Mateusz, come here! What is it? Will you hum this tune for me? I forgot it. Yeah, thanks. One, two, three, four! Is he crazy or what? We're closing now. - Do you need help, sir? - No. Thank you. - Marta. - Yes. We're on first-name terms. - Is anyone coming to get you? - Nah... I'll make it. I've got my wallet. I've got my address. I don't need anyone. Anyone. There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere. Wait! Mietek, wait! - What a nice grand piano! - Yeah, it is nice. Pass me that, please. - Are you all right? - Yes. Come on, let's go. I found it under the table. Your wallet. Yesterday, at the restaurant. Do you remember? Oh... Marta! - Yes, Marta. - Wait! - I can leave it in the hall. - No, no! Wait! On the right, by the wall. - And I'll close the door. - I'm coming! Here, see? I've got tea. No, please, just take it. I have to be at work in half an hour. I have to go. Here. Can I take you out after work? - Where exactly? - Where people normally go. No, no. You might run away. - I won't. - No... - No! - Jesus... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't... You're still here. Jesus... A mole. Another one. Here's something. It's a scar. An appendix scar. Jesus... What happened here? I gave birth to my son. You have a son? He's nine and his name is Marek. Marek... Well, I'm happy to hear that. And here's something. What is this? A gift from my ex-husband. Marek... What do you say? Hello, Mr Mietek. Hi. Are you blind? I only pretend. Just don't tell anyone. I can see you have a ball. You wanna play? Mum, he can see! No! You'll make me go deaf! That'll be something. God, it's terrible. You see nothing. Yes, it's terrible. Sometimes. - Mietek, what about your eyes? - What about them? Your beautiful eyes. Is there anything we can do about it? No, nothing. Hello, are you here to see me? The nerve damage is extensive. The left eye is more damaged than the right one. One-third of such cases are hereditary. Who had eye problems? Mum or dad? Mum is dead. And I know nothing about Dad. I'm sorry. Don't be. I had no expectations. Thank you. When's your next concert? This Sunday. In Hybrydy. Wasn't it funny? Mietek, I've been to Hybrydy. Has the piano been tuned? Well, no. Why not? My concert's on... When's that? This Sunday. Actually, they're out. - Because? - They're scared you'll run away. Marta, get me a shot of vodka. - Why are they scared? - That they have to refund tickets. Get me the vodka shot. How many times do I need to ask you... - Can't you talk to them? - You think I didn't? But they said... - What? - Well, you know... What did they say? - People always talk. - Jesus, just tell me. That... That I'm finished? No, not that. Mietek... You're like a brother to me. But there's nothing I can do. We have to wait them out. But I can't wait. I'm the best jazz pianist in this country! But it's a small country. Marta! - We're leaving. Marta! - I'm here. We're leaving. - Mietek... - Fuck that. You're fucking fired. I don't need you! I'll be fine without you! You have talent and imagination I can only dream of. You could have it all, but you're wasting time! And you'll end up alone! Alone! There's a shop... Buy me a bottle of vodka. - Mietek, let's go. - Buy me vodka! Are you deaf?! - Buy it yourself! - Marta! Get back here! Marta! Marta! Marta! Marta! - I'm here to see Maestro. - Sorry, he's not in. - I just wanted to tell him... - He's gone away. Maestro! I'm going to... Get out or I'll call the Militia. Maestro! Maestro! Maestro... Red. Yellow. Blue. I wanted to see you because... Yes? I sent your test results to a friend of mine. He runs a clinic in Vienna. You might recover vision in your right eye. He can operate on you. There's no certainty, but there's a chance. We can't guarantee anything. Your hearing might change. - Everything's going to be different now. - Yes. Madam, allow me to introduce myself. Izydor. Friends call me Izi. Can you tell them to leave? - Pretty ladies can join our party. - Mietek... Red. Blue. You want to play the colour game? What game is it? What colour is this? Touch it. Red. Play it. You remember that? Then play the red. And this one? Yellow. Then play the yellow. You remember that? Look up now. What colour is that? Mietek, it's me. Here, have a drink. Holy hell. Back. Lie down and rest a little. Mietek! Mietek! Mietek! Coming. - Yes? - It's me. Zenek. Mietek, come on! Open up! Father's getting worse. Wait... He wants you to come over. He's our father. Zenek... You needn't have come. Go home. He's gone blind. Mietek? Mietek, is that you? Yes. Where are you? Come here. Sonny... You're here. My little Mietek. How are you doing out there, in Warsaw? Fine. Do you have a family? I play. I know. I have a newspaper here... On the window. Give it to me. Give it to me. Zenek brought it. They write about you. You played abroad. I played in Vienna. In Paris. In the Camelot Club. I won the first place in Montreux. Montreux... Mietek... Don't you feel sorry? For what? Don't I feel sorry for what? You are the eldest one. Without that eye mess, you'd own this farm. What a tragedy... Here. From the plum tree by the barn. Hey, brother, what do you play in that big city? Jazz. Ah, jazz. That's nice. Nice. The biggest thrill is when I'm playing, when I'm telling people what I feel. When I'm improvising, I can express what I might see. And who is Mietek Kosz in private? - Do you want to start a family? - Of course I do. But... It's not that simple. Shall we go now? Is it hard to find a woman who can love and understand? I did find her. I don't feel lonely. I don't know what the future will bring, but for now, things are going well. So, Mietek Kosz is happy now. Yes. I'd rather not jinx it. I'd rather not. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Are you surprised? Some of you surely are. You thought: "Mietek Kosz is finished." But look, he's sitting at the grand piano, playing. The human brain has plasticity. When someone loses sight, the parts of the brain responsible for vision start to help those responsible for hearing. The left hand, not the right one. The left hand is the most important. I don't know where it comes from, I just hear something and I play it. So, the left hand and the sense of hearing. I think I understand what you're trying to tell me. Thank you. You've helped me a lot. Thank you. Being alone. It's a natural state for a blind man. It took me some time, but I simply had to accept it. So, please don't feel sorry for me because I can't see. I won't be any different. Just listen to me. This is what I live for. I want you to listen to me, to enjoy it with me, and to applaud. This is my latest composition "Icarus". People say it's about me. 31 May 1973. This is my composition "Icarus". I had this dream... That Mietek fell out the window, but was still alive. And... He was sitting on the pavement and I ran up to him. And I said: "Mietek, what have you done?" And he told me: "But I didn't want that." I remember it calmed me down. Well, I think... There are things between us we never finished. Things we never talked about. I wish it had turned out differently. And I'm really sorry about that. I wish I hadn't left him back then. I miss him terribly. Because I liked him a lot. Without him, I guess... ...my life would have been different. Yes, I did love him. No, I'm sorry. I didn't love him. No... I didn't love him. He didn't fall down. He flew up. Mietek Kosz died tragically on 31 May 1973. He was 29 years old. translated and subtitled by Magdalena Cedro
