My father bought a little goat for two zuzim... Hello? One little goat, one little goat... Shay, is that you? Then came the cat that ate the goat... Shay, where are you? Tell me, I'll be there. That ate the goat that father bought... Then came the angel of Death... What's going on? A film by Oded Davidoff Bar Belfer Yonatan Bar-Or Yuval Mendelson Rinat Matatov Tzahi Grad Danny Steg Based on a book by David Grossman Directed by Oded Davidoff S So Som Some Someo Someon Someone Someone t Someone to Someone to R Someone to Ru Someone to Run Someone to Run W Someone to Run Wi Someone to Run Wit Someone to Run With Someone to Run With They found it three days ago running around downtown. No ID tags, nothing. Took three inspectors to bring it in. The beast hasn't calmed down since. Quiet, you animals! Quiet! Now, Assafi, what we do is, as follows: We put a leash on it, follow it wherever it goes. Let it lead us straight to its owners. Because what if it's a seeing-eye dog? Ever think of that? But, say you find the owners and they're A-OK? Then, my friend, what you say is as follows: A dog without a license is in violation of the Dog Control Act, paragraph 6b... Owner is guilty of negligence and liable for a summons... You like dogs, I see. Yes. I always wanted one. Well, now you do. You're all set. How long do I follow him like this? How long? Until you find the owners. Don't just stand there! Run! Wait! You forgot the summons! Here. Don't forget their signature! In duplicate! And don't be shy! Yeah, thanks a lot. Roy, Meital, what's up? You dope! I thought it was a suicide bomber. You could've been shot. Out of the way! What are you, deaf? Move it already! So what are you... Her brother? Her boyfriend? The girl's, not the dog's! Where's she been? She sent you instead? And didn't even leave you her bike? Dude, you're in trouble. It's a she? Sure, she's a she. What are you, blind? 46 Shekels, please. And tell the girl I said hi. Tell her we miss her! Are you a church dog? You speak English? You're back! My darling Dinka... I missed you so. Sir! What is your business, sir! Sorry... I'm here to return the dog. Oh, and they said... to give you this. From her? To me? Finally... It's just a summons from the city. Really. I should go. Go? No sir! By no means! Perhaps just a note? A memo to deliver? It's dreadfully important. I'm from the City Sanitation Dept. It's my summer job. I mean, my Dad is an electrician there... And he had to go abroad... But how did you know to deliver Sunday's pizza, sir? And how is that Dinka let you tie her leash? Besides Tamar, no one would dare get close. Tamar? She's the owner? And she lives here? - No, no sir. She has a home, a mother and father. And you, sir? Who are you? Your name. If you know it. Assaf. - Assaf. A psalm of Assaf... "But as for me... My feet were almost gone... "My steps well-nigh slipped..." I am Theodora. Head Nun. Please. You choose mushrooms. She, olives. But won't you tell me where she's gone? Two months ago What's up, kiddo? Don't be scared, little doggie. Watch out. She bites. Sure, heard that before. I was like that too. Bit every hand that reached out. Say, sister, I've been watching you all week. Comin' and goin', with your guitar case. But I haven't heard you strum one string. What are you really looking for? Do you know? Nothing. What if I told you there was someone who could show you exactly what you're after. Interested? Depends. Rabbi Nachman! Mysteries of the universe revealed. All yours, sister. Does it come with a magnifying glass? The heart is your magnifying glass. Take it, it's free. Dinka Kimchi. 6 HaNasi Street, Jerusalem. Two good Jerusalem girls slumming it. Excuse me. Dinka, come! Hey! Kimchi girls! Don't run from Achikam! So she's a girl? Tamar? Indeed, a girl. Your age. Theodora's only friend these many years. She comes and helps me with everything you see. But then, suddenly with no warning... she... Oh, my dear electrician! How delighted I am! Two months ago she tells me she won't come here any more. Because of me? No, she assures me. And she is gone. But... If I had an address... Two weeks later, the telephone rings in the evening. Always silent, suddenly it rings. I listen. "Hello?" Silence. No reply. "Hello!" And I hear... Tamar? - And she says nothing. And I--Her breathing, I hear. The fear in her breath, I hear. Did you call the police? The police? She explicitly said not to. Mrs. Theodora, why don't I just keep looking? Yes, Mr. Assaf, yes, keep looking! Find her... A month and a half ago Those were the days Of early summer The dawn of days Nice haircut, egghead. - In the orchards... Didn't get a haircut? - Got a comb? Prickly pear and olive trees Get lost! - A whispering breeze A wanderer Down a dusty path Harvest days... You're amazing! Yeah, right. I swear! You are! I'm Squirrel. I mean, that's my name. It sucks, doesn't it? - No. It's pretty. I wish I could sing like you. But I'm one of the ones that can't. Hey, you have a place to sleep? Yes. 'Cause I have a cool squat. Like, if you need it. OK. Thanks. Shh... Dinka. Hungry? Say... Do you know a kid from downtown, really cute, skinny, big eyes... plays a black electric guitar? Doesn't talk much? But he's an amazing musician. What's he to you? Nothing. Just asking. Good. Probably not much left of him anyway. Haven't seen him play for three or four months. And if you don't bring in the bacon, you're out of the Home. What Home? "Pesach's Home for the Gifted". One big happy family. Family, my ass. Family like that, you're better off an orphan. How do I find this place? You don't. It finds you. Son of a bitch! Been chasing you and your fucking dog all over town! Now we're even, motherfucker! Where'd you stash it, huh? What'd you do, stash it or swallow it? OK, spill it. I want to know everything. Suppliers, dealers, names. The works. Let's have it! Listen to me, crybaby. I saw that fucking mutt of yours just a few weeks ago. Tied to some girl's arm. Five three, long dark hair, sixteen or seventeen years old. Sound like your girlfriend? I don't know what you're talking about... I don't know any drug dealers... what deal you're talking about. A real estate deal! Your girlfriend bought heroin! Every day we find another body. Another dumb kid with a needle in him. If you don't want her to end up like that, help us find her. Listen. Give me a name, address. Anything. And we might just let you walk. Danoch. Call Danoch! Who the hell is that? In my left pocket. Form 67 from the city. Call him, he'll tell you everything. One month ago My Darling I slipped from between your arms Three long weeks That took forever But when they're up I'll return to you I'll glide like a ship Like a gust of wind To be with you Yes, I'm on my way and very soon Triumphantly, I'll return to you Very soon we'll speak again I'll feel your warmth And breath... Folks, clear the square! There's a suspicious object! Damn those Arabs! They never leave us alone! Come, Dinka. Who did that to your hair? May he rot in hell. Food, you've got? Here, sweetie, help me cross. You have a place to sleep? Someone to look out for you? No, why? Oh, but you must! All alone, in the streets... Come with the old lady, won't you? There's a big home downtown, all musicians. One big family. Musicians? Like yourself, sweetie. From the streets. And my son, he runs the place. His name is Pesach. Pesach Beit Halevy. Never heard of him? Pesach? My father bought a little goat One little goat... Shut the fuck up already. Cool it, or you're out too. This way! "Maternity ward" Is that the style today? Then I'm in style. Attractive it ain't. Any idea where you are? Then I'll tell you. Pesach Bet Halevy's Home for the Performing Arts. That's me. Nice to meet you. Lots of folks here, like you. Singers, drummers, what have you. Talented kids who need a place to stay. Feel at home without being at home. Think you might like a place like that? I guess so. - Good. Let's talk about you. Name? Tamar... Cohen. Every other kid in here is Cohen. You'll feel at home. How old? Sixteen. And a week. And a week. Congratulations. Jonathan, tell her congratulations. Congratulations. Guitar and vocals, or just guitar? - Both. How long you're on the street, I won't ask. Domestic situation, I don't want to know. Now let's see what you can do. If you meet our standards. Now? Why, you need playback? Goddamn it, always the same song. Can't you do something in Hebrew? Today is your birthday A secret, old and new Set the table And let perfection come to you It's half past midnight We should get some sleep But something is stuck Stuck deep in my throat... I know that you know You're incredible Don't run, don't be afraid To take me as I am Now let me tell you what you do. You pack up your guitar and go home to Mom and Dad. This place isn't for you, believe me. No means no. Sign here. It says you're here of your own free will and you accept the rules. Hefty. Not bad. You know what he's looking for? - No. You take drugs? Because in here, no-one touches that shit. Ironclad law. If I catch anyone toking, shooting up, sniffing glue, even... I make sure he's sorry he was ever born. This place is 100% Art. Is that clear? Good. Now get the fuck out of my face. My dog. He threw her out of the van. I can't perform without her. She wants to, she'll find you. If not then she won't. Metal shop. Rhino? Assaf? Hold on a sec! Kamal, quit hammering! What happened, Assaf? - Nothing. I'm OK. You eat lunch? No, not yet. Sima's? Fifteen minutes? Where are you? I'll pick you up. No, I'll meet you there. Fuckin' hell! Hey, whose dog is this? Mine. Sorry. Daddy-o, hold on to him, huh? You don't want to find him on the grill. Saul speaking. Listen, that dog you asked about? Well, it's here, having lunch. Nah, with some kid. A few minutes ago. But no rough stuff in the restaurant, OK? You listen good, Assaf. I have a buddy on the force. You tell me who did this, I'll call him right now. No thanks. The police have done enough as it is. And who's he? It's a she. Her name's Dinka. Hello Dinka. So you say a cop did this? Why? They thought I was dealing drugs. They what? Hey, Rhino. That dog with you? Looks like it. Talk to me. She's going back to the kennels, get it? Who knows who's looking for her or her junkie owner. Cops are like boy scouts next to those guys. She's a cool girl, Rhino. She helps people. Sure. Helps them find a vein. She's probably in trouble. That's all. The drugs she bought weren't even for her. Man, you are a dreamer! Just like your sister. You go chasing some dog. She's after the American dream. And I have to sit and wait. Don't look so gloomy. Reli will be back someday. Sure. First thing tomorrow, the mutt's back at City Hall. OK. We'll see. - Don't "We'll see" me. You're naive, kid. I'm sick of hearing that all the time. Stop busting my... - Your what! Busting your what? - My balls, OK? Mazel tov. Come on, I'm gonna bust something else, too. What's the score? 10, 12 to nothing? You wish. How tall are you? How should I know? Five nine. Ten. You're five six. I can see your scalp. Tough guy! Chicken Little. - You're a certified dwarf. You're a twig. - Even Reli was taller than you. Here. Stab me in the heart. Go on, with a twist. Rhino, I'm sorry. We rhinos have thick skin. If Reli needs her space, I'll give her plenty. As long as she doesn't forget where she belongs. She won't. I promise. What can I say, Assaf. Heck of a way to pick up a girl. Get a mattress, take it to the second floor. Pediatric ward. Dinner's at 6 PM. Ask someone how to get there. Doors close at 6:15. Tomorrow Pesach will give you your route. Questions, comments, complaints. Keep them to yourself. One, I said! Put the other one back. I've been watching you on the street for two weeks. Don't think we're not on to you. Dinka! Where have you been! This is Avraham Danoch. Sanitation Dept. Jerusalem. We waited for you until 5:10. If you haven't found the owners, please return the mongrel to the kennels. Thank you. Assaf, it's me, Rhino. Just making sure you weren't kidnapped or something. Be in touch. I'll be working late at the shop. If you hear from your parents, give me a shout. And watch yourself, OK? Hello. Assafi, are you there? He's not home. - Give me the phone. Assafi, honey, we're in Taos, at Reli's. We finally met James, and he is so sweet! We helped Reli move her things into his place. They look so happy together. Fuck... Love you. Hugs, Mom. Rise and shine, dopeheads. Come on, get up! Breakfast's in 15 minutes. You're late, you wait. Shelly, that goes for you too. What a wonderful way to start your day. You slept in my bed. That's why. Sorry. The room was empty. There was no mattress, so... - That's no mattress. It's an incubator for fleas. Don't worry about it, sis. It's cool. I was so wasted, I could've laid down on top of you and not noticed. Shelly. Tamar. Love the buzz cut. If I did that I'd be all chin and ears. So, you like the lodgings? Actually, I don't. But I like the lodgers. Sister, you haven't met the lodgers. Just the morning dove. I think I also met the pig. It's a beautiful day! Clear skies, great acoustics. So who feels like making some music? Is this everyone? Some folks'd give their souls to have the talent God gave you. And you sit here like it's a geriatric ward. Come on, who's going out there to knock 'em dead! Me, I am! Me! Please, Pesach! Me! Pretty please! Give it to me, Pesach! You know what I like about you, Shelly? You party all night, sneak back in at 6 AM and after a half hour's sleep you're at full volume. You're the best, Shelly. That's right, folks. Step right up. You want to be useful? Help me with the bald kid. Take her to the board, show her the route. She's all booked, so she better snap out of it. Go, on. Move it. Young lady. The dog food is on your dime, not mine. Understood? Son of a bitch. Pesach's got informers everywhere. You see his red notebook? The Jungle Book. All day, writing, erasing, moving us around like checkers. Then his bulldog puts it up on the board. OK, let's see where he put you. He puts the newbies down as question marks. 'Cause, you're still pending. Holy shit! Girlfriend, you got one hell of a first day! He's hauling you all over the country today. Wait, it's not just in Jerusalem? You're not in Kansas anymore, babe. It used to be only Jerusalem. Now he's an empire. These days it's Pesach, Matzah and Maror. OK, let's see where I am, maybe we'll overlap. I don't believe it! Son of a bitch! Goddamn son of a bitch! The bastard! Shelly, stop! Get your hands off me! See the kind of penalties he comes up with? Has me playing Kiryat Ono... The most evil place in the country. On one hand, the junkies who want to kill me. On the other, my Mom... who called the cops on me last time she saw me. I can't go back there. I can't. You don't know where you've come to, Tamar. You don't know Pesach. There you go. Room service. Summer vacation or what? You talk to them? Who? Your parents. No. I mean, they left a message. What did they say? Reli coming back or what? Rhino, they just got there two days ago Reli doesn't know herself. What's to know? She took off, saw America, what's so complicated? You know her. She's complicated. Do me a favor, ask her. Just so I know if I'll be single forever or if there's a ray of sun. I thought Rhinos have thick skin. Yeah. The truck's downstairs. I'm taking you to City Hall. Come on. - Rhino, look. I... I decided not to bring her back yet. Still dreaming about that junkie? Anything happens to you, kid, your parents would never forgive me. Come on. Dinka, we're going. Rhino, stop. I don't think you understand. Rhino, I have a job to do, and I'm going to do it. And that's final. Rhino! I'm not giving her back, OK? I've had it with everyone telling me what to do! "Go out with Dafi, get a job, forget the junkie..." You sound like a little kid! What do you care, anyway? All you care about is what Reli thinks about you. That's right, I care what Reli thinks! Excuse me for living in the real world and not in some teenager's wet dream. Living in the real world, huh? If you haven't found the owners, please... If you hear from your parents... He's not home. - Give me the phone. Assafi, honey, we're in Taos, at Reli's. We finally met James, and he is so sweet! We helped Reli move her things into his place. They look so happy together. Love you. Hugs, Mom. "Leaving Jerusalem" The crown prince set off Packed a bag And the ocean breeze Swam the seas Looking for land Now he looks out at the boats And yesterday's hopes Still alone Perhaps in a dream There's a castle of gold Perhaps in that world All is perfect Got any food? No, sorry. I mean, yeah. I do. Hey, is this D&D? Yeah. You know it? Sure. Which characters do you play? I'm ranger. Or thief. He is Troubadour. Have you seen a girl around here? With this dog? Long dark hair? Yes. - You have? Yeah. Small. But not scared. I was scared of her. Came with that dog. Wants to bite me. Asking all sorts of questions. About what? Do you remember? Showed me a picture of a man. Asked, who saw him. When... A man? A kid. I don't know. Boyfriend, maybe. Some guitar player from downtown. That one there, Paganini. He knows. Should I wake him up? What did he say? Something in Russian. Wake me up for his funeral. Anything else you forget to tell me? A man? A boyfriend? Maybe a husband and kids, too? Move, Dinka. You're blocking the sun. That's better? Yes, thank you. Hey, kid. Didn't you see the sign? What sign? Big neon sign. No fags allowed! Now do you see the sign? Yeah, now I see it. Leave him alone, Herzl. Somebody kicked his ass already. Let's take the dog and go. What if he pissed in the water? OK, give him a warning. Excuse me. You're hurting the dog. What did he say? You're hurting her. Leave her alone. Yeah? So come get her. Son of a bitch! You're hurting her! You're crazy. Maybe you'll find her after all. What's this... You're OK. Hey! How do you open this? Where've you been, girlfriend? Long time no see. Shelly, are you tripping? Me? I never touch that shit! You should be ashamed of yourself. 100% Art! Oh my God! You have the biggest nostrils! You know that? Shelly! Shelly, who's in the elevator? What? The detox room? Come on, don't bring me down. Shelly! Why is there a detox room here? You're always shaking me, you notice? He said no drugs allowed! Shelly? Shelly! Shelly, get up! Shelly? Lousy trip. 100% Art, huh? Pesach sells to everyone. He said no drugs allowed? Sure. No drugs he doesn't sell. But why should he? Doesn't he make enough from our shows? Tamar, his money's not from our shows or the weed he sells us. Don't you get it? That's chump change. Haven't you heard about Pesach's pool of tears? What's going on? Nothing. Cramps. Got my period. Don't believe me, see for yourself. Shelly, Pesach's had it with you. Fine. Let him kick me out. Sure. And have you crawl back like last time? Broken teeth, cigarette burns? You tell your girlfriend about that? I was just about to. Clean up your filth and get to bed. Good night. Shelly... Shelly, you awake? No. What's Pesach's pool of tears? Forget it, Tamar. Come on, Shelly. Remember Alice in Wonderland? When she's crying and crying, and cries a pool of tears? And she says to herself, stupid bitch, why did I cry so much? Now I'm going to drown in my own tears! Remember? In here we say that our tears trickle down the drains through the pipes into the basement. And there, Pesach collects them, in a giant pool of sorrow. And if you're not careful, you drown in your own tears. We're getting out of here, Shelly. I swear. You and me. You and me aren't going anywhere, kid. What did you think, he peddles folk songs? Pushes that shit all over the country. You and me and everyone here, we're all his pawns. "Jerusalem Central Bus Station" "Baggage check" So she's not that small. Maybe five three? Sligo, what did I say about the beard? Listen to your manager. You'll double your income. You listen to Pesach. Holy shit! Not this puke again! Young lady. Some people work very hard to make your food. Hey, Pesach. Why can't we have something decent for breakfast? Like pizza or something instead of this crap? I'm sick of it! You always say you're looking out for us. So do it right, for once. Come on, people, who wants pizza? Pepperoni, anchovy... Come on, let's hear it. Everybody. Mushrooms, cool! - Onions! Jonathan, you getting all this? Pizza with olives. You know what, Shelly? Today, even you can't spoil the karma. You made a killing yesterday, folks. You made Pesach proud. And, as you may have heard, someone very near and dear is back in the game. Mr. Speedy Gonzales, back from the dead. With his magical fingers and sour puss. Where the hell are you, kid? Give a yell. Gonzales! So go get him already! Who's this Speedy? The prodigal son. Brilliant guitar player. Only he's a goner. Leave him alone. The kid has to eat. Come on, people, dig in. Get your vitamins. How you gonna be big and famous without vitamins? A week before you got here, he tried to take off. Stole the petty cash, took the keys to the van, and beat it. Place goes into total lockdown. Jonathan goes berserk. And Pesach, that mad genius? Calls the cops. Didn't think twice. I swear. Dialed 911. He said: "Listen, one of my poor kids ran away. "He's trying to kick a habit. "Please find him. Bring him back here." You get the balls on this guy? "Private. Do not read. Please!" "Took Dinka to the vet..." "Leah, my best friend ever..." "Mom and Dad". Dear Mom and Dad. So you've found another of my secret hiding places. Bravo. I don't expect you to understand what I'm doing. But after so many years of hypocrisy, someone had to do something. I'm sorry I had to lie. Not that it was hard. I knew you wouldn't notice. Please don't blame Leah. None of this was her idea. I bear full responsibility. But even Leah saw there was no other way. I hope you will too. And that you'll forgive me if I've made a terrible mistake. Love, Tamar. Leah's restaurant. Please hold. Yes? - Is Leah there? Who's calling? - I need to talk to her! It's an emergency. She's not in. Do you want to leave a message? Hello? I'm sorry. I really had to make a call. I'm leaving now, OK? Pesach! Pesach, quick! It's the bald one! Personal calls?! Is that how you show your gratitude? Come on, quick! Who'd you call? Who did you call! Who did you call! My Grandmother. - Don't lie to me! Don't you lie. Who was it? My Grandmother. Her Grandmother. Son of a bitch. Tamar? Is that you? This story stinks like a motherfucking... Like I don't know what. You're lucky this time. You think you're smarter than the rest of us? I've had my eye on you! From the very first day! I don't know what you're up to. But I'm watching you from now on. With four eyes! You hear me? Not two, four! Sorry. It's only me. Tamar, you shouldn't be here. You've got a future. You're not like us. Yeah, right... You're much more talented than I am. Don't make me laugh. I'm all smoke and mirrors. But you're so mean! You've been here a month already. And everyone's saying what a star you are. And I'm the only one who hasn't heard you sing. Please? Shelly, I can't. Please, Tamar? Please... Yes! Everyone, get your asses up here. Show's starting! The star is doing her thing! Play something sad, OK? Things have been too cheerful around here lately. Suddenly you're back Suddenly you're home Give me a minute to adjust It happened so fast I had a hard time But I'm not complaining I know It wasn't easy for you lf... If only And only if we dare We'll be around tomorrow too Don't apologize It doesn't matter anymore Give me a moment To get used to you again Give me a moment To get used to you again Suddenly you're back Suddenly you're home Give me a moment to adjust It all happened so fast... Goddamn! Where did that come from? Been practicing behind my back? Holy shit! Pesach, these two will make you rich! What do you mean, rich? This is a whole different league! Hey, Jonathan, see what a genius I am? Put them one after the other next week. Talk about karma. You know what? I'm gonna put them together. Hamashbir square. 170 person capacity. They'll fill the place. "We're getting out next week." Come on, Dinka. Come on. Hi. Hi there. Hello! How are you? I didn't recognize you... with that haircut. I need a high E string. How is the prodigy? Still playing, I hope. Thank you very much. Wait! "Urgent! Please call Leah!" "Thursday. 11 AM. Hamashbir parking lot. Northern entrance." Leah's restaurant. Hello, Leah please. Tamar. Shelly... What's wrong? You were right, baby. We need to get the hell out. Shelly, now? Now! Pesach's out with Sligo and Jonathan's out for two more days. The bulldog's here alone and he's totally wasted. Shelly... - Baby, now's the time! Look, I'm all packed and I've got 200 shekels. It'll get us at least to Eilat. Shelly, I can't. But you said... I can't believe you're chickening out on me now. Shelly, I'm not. But we can't just leave. We can't? No. Let's talk about this tomorrow, OK? We'll think of a way to do it right. OK. Tomorrow. Promise? I swear. Take that dog and get away from here. Fast! Please, I'm looking for someone... They come around every hour looking for her and the dog. So for your own good. Go away, now! What's wrong, boss? Haven't found her yet? We're looking for a boy this time. Seen anyone? Chief, in the light of day, I can't see my own hands. So use your ears. You hear anything, straight to Pesach. Yes, ma'am. What's wrong with you kids? You should be home watching TV, not out in the streets. Shit. Uh, oh. It's that wasted Speedy dude again. No, I just saw him downstairs. It's Shelly! They found her on a bus on the way to Eilat... Shut the fuck up! Anyone else want to try their luck on the outside? Everybody downstairs. Lights out. Everyone inside. Move it! Come on, people. Eat! How else are you gonna grow? Get up! Big show today. Hold on... Oh, yeah, I forgot. Can't play without it. You get the other one after the gig. Son of a bitch. They put us together today. Did you see? Yeah? I didn't notice. "HaTikva". At 11 we sing the anthem and split! Leah will be there. Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. Quiet, he'll hear you. - I don't give a fuck. You're the one who's going to kill me. Not them. Shay, just do what I say and we're out of here! Listen, I'm not going into some institution. That's the first place he'll look! Bury me underground, he'll find me. We're not going to an institution. I bought you some dope. For the first few days. Who do you think you are? All your life you've been on my back. Leave me alone already! Who asked you to come here? Are you out of your mind? You called me! You're so wasted you can't even remember. You cried like a baby on the phone said you couldn't take it, that they're killing you. Is that how you want to die? In Pesach's place? In the back of a bus? Better than living at home. At least Pesach gives a damn. Lets us do what we want. You're such an idiot! - And you're a sanctimonious coward. A coward? I called you six months ago! Now you decide to show up? Or did I call at a bad time? What, you had finals? Auditions? You should have said something. I hate you! Dinka?! Where is all this going? Just so you know. Tamar is in a safe place. But like I said, I can't tell you where. So it's best if you leave the dog here. They can't find you without her. As for you... have patience. Maybe someday Tamar will call to say thank you. No, eh? - Sorry. No. But thanks for the food. Aren't you afraid? I have to find her. OK. Listen closely, Mr. Assaf. I love that girl, do you understand me? If you hurt her, do anything stupid or macho... anything like that I'll kill you. Is that clear? Good. This you give to her. And now you come with me. As long as in the heart, within A Jewish soul still yearns And onward towards the east An eye to Zion turns Our hope is not yet lost The two-thousand year old dream To be a free nation in our homeland Land of Zion Jerusalem Shit! Did I tell her north or south? Think she knows the difference? - Shut up already! Shit... Too bad about your careers, huh? All you do is take. You make me sick. Leah, stop the car! - What's wrong? It's Dinka! I forgot her! We have to go back! Let's take care of the kid first. Where are we going? They'll kill her! We have to go back! Dinka will manage for a few hours. I'll drop you off and come back for her! Just tell me where the hell we're going already? Take care of her. And watch yourself, huh? Leah, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to call someone. His name's Rhino. I mean, it's really Tzachi. It's a long story. Just tell him everything's OK. Tell him not to worry... - OK, got it. Tell the Rhinoceros to cool it. Don't move. Don't move! What are you doing here? Answer me already! Answer me. Who is he? I don't know. He's not talking. I'm Assaf. I came to bring Dinka back. Hold him. Not like that. You're hurting him. Shay? Don't give up on me, Shay. It's almost over. We're at the end. How did you know to come here? Leah brought me. Leah? Are you giving me a summons now? Oh, sorry... Sorry, no... Assaf. Tamar. I know. This is Shay. My brother. Your brother? Sorry about before... No, it's... It's nothing. So... The drugs you bought were for him? Yes. Leah told you? No, the cop who tried to arrest you told me. Dinka and I have been all over Jerusalem these past two days. First she took me to the Pizzeria, to pick up Sunday's pizza. Olives and mushrooms. Then, straight to Theodora. Who wouldn't say a word, of course. Until I fixed the lights. Then she opened up a bit. She was so sure I'd be the one to find you, I had no choice. So you kept going? Yes. So now what? Tamar, I want to stay. I mean, if you want me to go I will. I really don't want you to go. Take off your shoes! You too! Come on! Where'd you put it, huh? You bitch! Where is it? Where is it! Tell me! What have you done to me? Where is it? Where is it? Fuck you! Tell me, right now! Where the hell is it?! It's not funny! Where is it? Tell me! How do you like our hideout? She thought of everything. Even put Manchester United over my head. Thing is, I'm a Liverpool fan. Remember that giant snowstorm in Jerusalem? Tamar was about eight. Because of the way the snow was coming down, our dad sent her to stock up on bread from the local store. She puts on her rain boots, takes her umbrella, and goes out. Three hours later she comes back. Comes in with a bag of bread. From Angel's Bakery. Our store was out of bread. So she went to the next one. They were out, too. So she kept going. Went from store to store. Across the whole city, you understand? But she came back with the bread. Assaf, do you have siblings? Or is it just me who's screwed. Yes, I have a sister. Reli. Actually it's Israela. But she had it changed. She hated that name. I don't blame her. Israela. She has names for everyone. She called her boyfriend Rhino. Then she dumped him and the name stuck. What did she call you? - Me? She had all kinds. Come on... Certified Dwarf. You? - Seriously. Until 9th grade I was the shortest kid in class. I came back from summer break, no one recognized me. For my song is a whispering wind Scattered and forgotten My path, my longing The echo of my prayers My song is a leaf in the wind Scattered and forgotten The soft light That fills my nights Is you, walking towards me That's the most amazing thing I've ever heard. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said. Not interrupting any romantic moment, I hope. What did you think, you could walk out on Pesach? Take everything he has and walk away like a filthy bitch? Leave her alone! But everything comes back to Pesach in the end. Look at your little hero over here. Has no idea that he led us right to you. Now that's what I call karma. Assaf, it's not your problem. Let them handle it. It's good you told him where you were. He was so worried, he handed over the junkie and his sister just so you'd be OK. Hey Pesach, "and our flag was still there." I love you. Pick a hand. Come on, Speedy, pick one. A fifty, a la Pesach. And another fifty, a la Pesach. Go on, Shay, take it. On the house. Shay, you don't need it! Sure you do! Without it you're nothing! You want to be a musician? A guitarist? Think you can play without your fix? Look at that. My own soul I gave you! My own soul! Pesach! Pesach! It's your fault he'll never play again! Yours! Pesach, we said no violence. Cut it out! Stop! Where the hell are you guys! Pesach? Pesach! I had no idea what you were doing. I thought you lost your mind. We were waiting for him to hand over the drugs. You didn't catch my signal? Party's over, folks. Tzachi, get the kid out of here. You two, there's a lady in a blue Volvo waiting to take you home. Let's go. Let's go, big guy. "Welcome to Jerusalem" You missed all the action down there. Thanks a lot. Well, Mr. Rhinoceros. It was a pleasure. Would you please call me Tzachi? Tzachi, do me a favor, I need to get these kids home. Oh, OK, sorry. And forget the steakhouses. Next time come to my restaurant. Food's better. I'll be there. Tomorrow. Tamar, honey. Trade numbers and let's go. It's late. So... Thanks for everything, Assaf. For bringing Dinka back. Maybe I'll come visit her sometime. Sure. Whenever you want. Because... we got kind of close, she and I. Didn't we, Dinka? OK, I... I have to go. Bye, Assaf. Bye. Come on, Dinka. Come.
