Clean the mess up, Uncle Wen I'll go get the mop These photos were your grandma's favorites December 15, 1978 Great World Amusement Park is finally closing And Brilliant Pearl Photo Studio has to move To be honest, I'm reluctant to leave The histories of Brilliant Pearl and Great World are intertwined Growing up together, going through thick and thin We'll be saying farewell tomorrow And this parting will be forever Leaving only beautiful memories Uncle Wen, do you know the people in these photos? It's been such a long time. I can't remember Think harder, Uncle Wen Let me see Oh, yes Your grandma had an old friend He used to work at Great World He's called Ah Beng He attended your grandma's funeral last week How can I find him?

Since that night, Rose became even more popular all the way till 1978 when the Flamingo shut down along with the rest of Great World Grandpa, why did Great World close down? Singapore became prosperous in the 1970s Night markets were falling out of fashion Supermarkets were opening everywhere Cinemas too Most importantly, TV came People who had TV sets stayed home at night The world had changed and Great World was falling behind It had no choice but to shut its doors Great World was torn down in 1978 During the 1990s a mall was built over the site So you sold kebabs till 1978? The last stick of kebab I sold was five-spice flavored right outside Sky Cinema The last movie being screened was Eliza Frazer It's working Thank you Grandpa Who are they?
