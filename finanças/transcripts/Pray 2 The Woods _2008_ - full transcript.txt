Thank you so much for being here today. We have a great show in store for you. Bonnie Johnson is here promoting her new movie, run, hide, pray. And currently topping the charts with her hit single white t-shirt, that's right, Tara Leigh cobble. And I'm excited to have with us today the number one best selling author in the country to tell her story of survival. You won't believe it. Of course our very own domestic diva standing by in the kitchen ready to share her favorite holiday recipes with us. - That's right, Emily. Today I'm gonna show you how to make my family's famous harvest casserole that will leave your guests wanting more. Yum, you're gonna love it! - So don't go anywhere. We'll be right back. - Come on! - You're gonna need this. It's supposed to get really cold tonight. - Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait! Help me! Please! Please! - Hey lady, what are you doing out here? Are you okay? - Help me, please! - Get in. - Okay Emily, we're ready. You're on in 60. - Oh. - Thanks. - Let me get that for you. Where are you going with those donuts? - Welcome back. Our next guest is near and dear to my heart. It's actually a story that I covered when I was still a local reporter out in the field. - Okay, okay. I still can remember the night that the call came into the news room that a young mother was missing. I was one of the first reporters out on the scene, and police were everywhere searching for answers but finding very little. It was such a somber scene, and it seemed quite hopeless. Fortunately our story took a turn for the best. I'm gonna let her come out and tell the story herself. Let's bring out Laurie Curtis. - Thank you for having me. - Thanks for being here. You look great. - Thanks. So do you. And congratulations on your own show. This is so exciting. - You must have been so scared when you did decide to make a run for it. - Yes. Absolutely. But I kind of looked at it this way. I knew I was fighting for my life so I'd rather take my chances trying to escape than to hang around and see what he had in mind for me. - Sure. Sure. I can understand that. So tell us what happened next? Did the police ever catch up with him? - Well, the police have been very helpful. I told them everything that I knew and I even tried to help them locate where the barn was. And they were able to find out who he was and where he lived. But once they got there, he had been long gone and unfortunately, he's been evading the police, I guess, for about a year now but they assure me they're still on the case. - It's such an incredible store, you're such an amazing woman. - Oh, well thank you. I give the credit to the lord. I know that without him, I wouldn't have gotten through it. I just know that all good things come from the lord, and that he takes care of us, and I knew if I had faith that I would see my daughter and my husband again. So he answered my prayers. Here I am. - Well we're so thankful to have you here today alive and well and here to tell your story. Speaking of your little girl, she's here today with us in the audience. Do you mind, can we bring her on out? - Sure. Sure. - Well, Laurie and marin, thank you for being here today and sharing your incredible story. And everyone in our audience today is gonna receive a free copy of Laurie's book. - We'll be right back after this. - And we're clear. We'll be back from commercial in 90 seconds everyone. - There you go. - This anybody's? - I got mine. - Got everything? - Get my back pack on. - Hey! - Come on. Come on! - Where? Where's spiders? - Y'all gonna go to the lake? - I think I am. - Do we have the directions? - We don't need directions. - You sure? - Somebody get Trey to help. - No. We'll get Trey later. Let him rest. - This is so easy. - You're crazy. - Look at the guys. They still can't get their tent up! - Do you think we should go help them? - Guys, this is ridiculous. Come on. - Come on, they need real women. Let's go. - Let's show 'em how it's done. - Hold up, hold up, hold up. - Oh, no, what is going on! - We got it. We got it. - Obviously, you don't have it. - It's broken! - It's not broken. Y'all are broken. - We got it. - No, we got it. Get on out of here. Is somebody under here? Oh, my gosh! Just get out of here. - Just get out. - I love the tiaras. - Quadrant two, vector six, clear. Quadrant three, vector two, clear. Subject perimeter clear. - That's a relief. What is that? - What do you mean? - What is that? - It's a disguise for the stake out. - Stake out? We are not on a stake out. We're simply here to watch Laurie's house. - We want to blend in. We don't want to be conspicuous. - Blend in? What is that? - This? It's my paint ball gun, you know, for protection. - Could you just be serious? - Okay. Quadrant five, vector two, clear. Quadrant four, vector three, clear. Five of diamonds. - No. - Five of diamonds. - No again. - Ace of spades. - No. Do you ever get that right? - Sometimes. - Can't we just be serious here? - Four of clubs. - You ever think about shuffling the deck. They're all... - Ha! - Did you invite him? - Sorry, dude, I thought it was a stake out. - What next? - Hey, guys, I'm here for the stake out. - Stake out, stake out. This is not a stake out. Mr. Curtis simply asked me to watch his house while he's gone out of town. It's not a stake out, we're just watching the house. - Dude, I like your disguise, but I thought you had a pta meeting. - Yeah, I got out of it. - Can we just be serious here? - Hang on. - I brought donuts. - Sweet. - Can I get in? - Please, just get in, get in, and just be quiet. - Man, these are good. - Sugar high, though. - Want another donut? - You've got... You've got... Go like this. - Did I get it? - No, other side. - Did I get it? - Yeah, whatever. - These are good. - You guys just remember what goes up must come down, so you might want to layoff of these sugar donuts. - But they're so good. - Uh-huh. - I like the jelly. - I think it went really well tonight. - So this is what it's like being backstage, it's really cool. - Yes, it's pretty neat. I like to do the talk shows, they really treat you like a star. Well, I know she's going to love princesses on ice tonight, and are you sure you don't mind keeping her? - Heavens no, we're looking so forwards to it. - We always like to have marin. - Well, try to stick to the bedtime, and no soda at least after 9. - Right, we promise. - What happens at Mimi and papa's stays at Mimi and papa's. - Right. - Are you ready to go baby? Let's go sugar. - We don't want you to be late. - Big girl. - Love you guys. - Proud of you. - Thank you. - We'll see you soon. Okay, here we go. Bye. - See you soon, see you soon, love you. - Love you. - Okay, bye bye. - See you guys. - Mrs. Curtis, Mrs. Curtis! - Oh, yeah, of course. Thank you guys. - Can we get a picture? - Sure of course, yeah. - Can you take it for us? - Sure. Smile. Got it. - All right, thank you. - Thank you. - Sure, thank you guys. See you. Ah! - I'm so sorry. Do you mind signing this for me? - No, not at all. You scared me. - Sorry. - That's okay. There you go. - Thank you. - Sure. - It was so much fun. I really enjoyed doing the talk show. I'm home safe now. I'm locking it right now, and everything looks fine. The dead bolt, too. Yeah, I think the special forces are out there. They are. You know you don't have to hire them every time you go out of town. Okay, honey, if it makes you feel better. I haven't seen him. Lancer, Lancelot? He's probably just upstairs digging in the trash or something. Okay, well you go onto your meeting. Oh, it's going to be fine. I've got a movie. Okay, well, I will talk to you later. All right you call me or I'll call you. Love you, bye. Lance? Lance? Hey, good boy, are you okay? What's wrong, buddy? Hey, Carlie, this is Laurie Curtis. My dog's acting like he's not feeling too well. Can I bring him? You're open now? Awesome, thank you so much. - Hey, Mrs. Curtis, hey, Lance. - Hey, Carlie, thanks for waiting. - No problem. - He's been like this since I got home. I don't know what's going on. I don't know if he's sick to his stomach or what's wrong with him, but he just doesn't look good to me. - You know, something's definitely wrong with him. I'm going to have to have Dr. Bailey check him out. - Okay, he ran out to grab some dinner real quick, but he'll be back in a few minutes. It's been a very busy day. - Well, do you think he's going to be okay. - I'm sure he'll probably be fine. But if it's okay with you, can I keep him here overnight to run some tests? - Sure, absolutely. - Here's your information from last time. If I could just have you check your home or cell phone number, whichever one is more convenient for you. - Okay, great, my cell. - Okay. All right and I will go ahead and take him back, and I'll have Dr. Bailey call you as soon as we figure out what's wrong with him. - Okay thank you. Hey, good boy, be a good boy, all right? They're going to take good care of you. Okay, thanks Carlie. - No problem. Have a safe night. - All right, you, too. - I'm not watching that by myself. - Oh, man. Okay we need to go to surgery now. - Hello? Hey, Dr. Bailey. - Laurie, I'm glad we found you. Look, we found out what was wrong with Lance, but there may be someone in your house. - What? - Look, you gotta stay as calm as possible, but there were two adult male fingers. Laurie, that's not the worst part. They were wearing black leather gloves. I don't know, maybe broke into the house. Look, Lance bit their fingers off trying to protect the home. I don't know, but we called the police already. They're on their way, but he could still be in the house. Okay please look, be calm, be calm. He could be lying around somewhere, loss of blood, in shock somewhere. Please look around, anything messy, blood anywhere, please. - Laurie, can you hear me? Get out of the house now! If you can hear me, get out of the house now! If you can hear me, get out of the house now! - Help me, please, help me! He's in here, he's in here! Help! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's okay. You two take the right side. Ford, we'll take the left side of the house. - Clear. - Take the stairs. - Clear at the far end. - Clear, sergeant. - Clear. - Clear. - And he's in the closet downstairs or upstairs? - Downstairs. - Okay. - Clear the closet. - It's clear. You guys got anything? - Nothing, it's clear. - Corporal, this is what I need for you to do. Secure an entire perimeter around the house and the whole neighborhood. - Yes, sir. - Set up a command post also. - Contact ccbi immediately. - Yes, sir. - Have them process the scene. - Yes, sir. - 460 to dispatch. 460 to dispatch. - Dispatch go ahead, copy. - I'm at Laurie Curtis' place. We have a suspect at large and he is wounded, copy? - The Laurie Curtis place? - Affirmative. I need any assistance we can get from any local police departments. Also get the canine unit en route immediately. We need to lock this whole area down. Do you copy? - Copy. - He's back. - That's exactly how it happened. And people think I'm lying when I talk about it, but I don't even see why I would make something like that up. - Well, it is pretty hard to believe. - Come on, man. - No, I'm not calling you a liar or anything, I'm just saying it's pretty stretched. - Why would she lie about something like that? - I mean, it's like something out of a movie, you know? It's crazy. - Well, I believe you, Madison. - Thank you, Lacey. - Well, did they get him? - Honestly, the last thing I... - Did anybody... - Shhhh. - What? I just want to know the score of the game. - Shhhh. - I heard something. - Sit down, dude. - No, I thought I heard it, too. - Yeah, me, too. - Maybe it was just a squirrel or something, you know? - Yeah, it could have been anything. - You know, the police finally found out who the guy was based on where they found Laurie Curtis. Apparently he was just a regular guy according to the people at his church, but he got in a bad relationship with some girl, and she was kind of after him because he had a good job and some money. And so eventually he figured it out, and he got fed up with it. So he tried to end it, but she wasn't going that easy. - It's just the relationship's not working. - What's not working about it? - All of it. - Tyler, you're going to have to be a bit more specific than that. - We just seem to be going in our separate directions. You don't even go to church with me on Sunday. - Church has nothing to do with anything. - But it does, it has a lot to do with what I feel. - We're not having this discussion again. - Dasha, I think it's time you go your way, and I'm just going to go mine. - We can work it out just like we have every other time. - It hasn't worked. I think it's time for you to leave. - No. No. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? You're sorry? For everything that I've done for you, you're sorry? - Yes. - It's not over, not until I say it is. - So she went to the police and made some nasty accusations like he'd been beating her and things like that. And unfortunately for him, she was pretty convincing so... - He doesn't love me. - I'm sergeant Jake lyons. I'd like to come inside and ask you a few questions. - Okay, is everything okay? - They gave him five years in prison. He didn't do very well there. The police started getting really worried because he was extremely violent and introverted and so they put him in isolation. And then about three years went by. Eventually, his attorney came back and proved that his girlfriend had been lying and so they set him free on probation. - That still doesn't explain why someone would go after people like that, though. - Well, people all respond differently under pressure, and I can't imagine being convicted of a crime I didn't commit. It must be awful. - Yeah. - All right you guys, gather around and listen up. Here's the situation. We got a suspect on the run, probably on foot, and we have strong reason to believe that he is seriously injured. Now, I know some of you made big plans for tonight, but I just cancelled them. Relax, and here's what we need to do from here. We need more manpower to aid with the search. Let's activate a full recall. Wake them up if you have to. Let's get something very clear right now, folks. We're going all night if we have to. I want this guy apprehended before the sun comes up. Now, where's my map of the area around highway 56? - Got it right here, sergeant. - All right, highway 56 is here, here's lake Mitchell and these are the surrounding woods here. Now according to the report, the suspect entered the woods somewhere around here. We believe he's heading east towards the highway. - Okay, here's what we're going to do. I want units here, here, and here. I want to seal off this entire area. I want check points set up on any road that leads anywhere near that highway. Is that understood? - Yes, sir. - Any questions? - No sir, sir. - No sir. - Let's make it happen. - You got it, sergeant. - All right, who's in charge here? - That would be me. - Not anymore. How about some coffee? - I would love some. - I meant get me some. - Officer Simpson, get this man a cup of coffee. - So what does the FBI want with this guy anyway? - We believe he's involved in more than just these local abductions. We've been watching the grid to see if he was going to pop up anywhere. I guess he's a bit more obsessed than we thought. Anyway, we really want this guy. And I know you've had mayberry's finest working on the case, but the big boys are here now, so you girls can turn in for the night. Catch up on your beauty sleep, perhaps. - Agent manson, you know what I think? - No, what's that? - I think everything was just fine until you... - Sergeant, sergeant, serge, come on now. - What's the status on the canine units? - Um... - Today would be nice. - Looks like they're all on their way. The first one should be there in about five minutes, and the rest should be there in 20. - Come on, people. At this pace we'd be lucky if this guy hasn't managed to walk to the state line by the time our net is deployed. Look, radio them tell them to step on it. I want everybody there in ten, you got it? - Yes, sir. - Now let's move, people! - He's a good boy. - It just seems so wrong for all of that to happen to one person. - Seriously, it reminds me of those sayings that go around on e-mail like when someone wrecks their car, and it falls into the river, and just when you think they're about to drown, all the sudden they kick in the windshield, and then they start swimming. - I know exactly what you're talking about. So any ways they're trying to get away from this alligator and they're able to get away from the alligator, but they have the missing leg. So they're trying to go up this impossible hill, and as soon as they get up the impossible hill, they see this car, like we're going to be safe, right? So they're trying to get to the car, and as soon as they get to the car, the car loses control, hits them and kills them both. Isn't that crazy? - That's so wrong. - That's really rough, man. - Hey, I didn't make it up, okay? It's got a name, and it's called something like the... - The worst luck award. - We know, Ashley. - Exactly. But you know what? They are kind of funny in a morbid way. But they're sad, too. - Doesn't morbid mean sad? - Okay, Ashley. That's no squirrel. - Aah! - Are you crazy? We have a like a grizzly squirrel back here, and you're cracking jokes? - [Mocking) Oh! I'm so scared! Oh, Luke, please save me. Please, Luke! I want you to save me! - Get off me! You smell horrible. - We could have done without you on this trip. - Ashley! Ashley! - Hey! Hey! Come back here! - Ugh. - Hold up! Hold up! What are you thinking, man? We could have killed you! - Yeah. What's wrong with you! We thought you were going to kidnap her. You're lucky we didn't mess you up. - Oh, how sweet. Her guardian little angels. - What are you doing here anyway? I thought you had some competition or something to go to. - No, I got out early so I drove out here. - Yeah. Thanks, man. I can't believe you. - Come on, guys. I just thought it would be funny. Come on. It was hilarious. - Attention, all units! Please report to the rendezvous point on the double. I repeat, all units please report to the rendezvous point on the double. - Serge, just got a radio dispatch from 911. They're sending over an audio file. They think it has to do with the suspect. - All right. Let's hear it. - There's somebody in my backyard. - Ma'am, are you in immediate danger? - No. I think he went back into the woods. - Can you give me a description of him? - Um, it's pretty dark. He's probably six foot tall, dressed in all black. I think he saw me. - Ma'am, just remain calm. We have units very close to you. - When and where was that? - That's two miles east of Mrs. Curtis' house. It looks like it was 15 minutes ago. - 15 minutes? Does everything happen that slowly around here? At least he hasn't gotten away. Contact the ground units. Tell them they have a gopher net deployment. - Yes, sir. All units! All units! Suspect has been spotted three clicks east 15 minutes ago moving towards highway 56. Move to intercept. I repeat move to intercept. - All right. People, listen up. We just got the go ahead on the man hunt. Let's be careful. We need this guy alive. No shots fired unless you have to. Let's move it. - Hey, serge, helicopter just arrived on the pad. It's waiting for you. - Oh, it's about time. Agent manson, if you will excuse me. We've got a bad guy to catch. You can just sit back and relax. Enjoy the show. If you need more coffee, officer simps can help you with that. Don't worry. We'll do all the hard work. But I'm sure as usual you gotta take all credit for it. Whirring overhead] - Corporal, I think we got something. - Yeah. He's definitely been through here. 14 apex command, he's definitely been through this way. All right, everybody, from now on we're going silent. - You want one? - Yeah. - Does anybody have an extra wire hanger so we don't have to do this? - Ah. - Take mine. - It will work. - It's not working. - Oh. - It's not going to work. - Got another marshmallow? So I haven't seen you around church much lately. What's up? - Oh, um, nothing is up. I've just been busy. That's all. - That's cool. I know you got a lot going on. I just miss seeing you around. That's all. - Thanks, brother Dave. Who knows. Maybe I'll be back some day. - Yeah. Just don't wait too long, all right. - What do you mean? - Aw, nothing. Forget it. - No. Seriously what do you mean? - Well, you see this fire here? There's this guy and everybody liked him. I mean, a really cool guy. Class act. Made good grades. Had a great girlfriend. Even got along good with his parents. Went to church regularly. He just had it all going for him. And then one day out of the blue his girlfriend dumped him. I mean, no warning. Just like that. And that just sent a shockwave through his life. One thing started going bad, then another. Pretty soon his grades started to slip. And that led to more fights with his parents, and then before long he dropped out of church completely. It's so funny how we run from the one place that can actually help us, you know. Anyway, this guy's life is in a free fall. I mean, even his close friends have just given up on him. Just wrote him off. Next thing you know several weeks have passed and he's sitting at home by himself, depressed. Alone in the dark. Hadn't even left the house in a couple days and he's just sitting there by the fireplace. That's the only light in the entire house. Then he hears a knock at the door. - Kind of scares him. He knew he hadn't invited anyone over, so he ignores it. A few seconds later the knock is back. This time a little louder. Little more intense. He says all right, I didn't invite anybody over. So he just ignores it. A third time boom, boom, boom. - Even louder. So finally he gets up and he walks to the door, and as he puts his hand on the doorknob and opens it, he looks out and sees this huge dark silhouette. As he's peering into the darkness trying to find out who it is, his eyes adjust. And he sees an old friend from church standing there. It's a freezing cold night and his friend is just staring at home, and he says, "can I come in?" And he guys is like, "well, yeah. Come on in." So he reluctantly let's him in and they walk into the living room. Again there's no lights on, so now there's two guys sitting there staring at the same fire. Neither of them saying a word. So a few minutes go by and then a few more. Before you know it, a half hour has gone by. These guys have said nothing. Finally the friend that invited himself over gets up and the guy thinks he's fixing to leave, but instead he walks up to the fireplace just like this, and he takes those fireplace tongs and he reaches into the fire and he grabs one red hot coal, and takes it out and he holds it up and then he sets it right in front of them on the brick hearth, and he just watches it. So his friend looks at it. They stair at it as it was bright red. And then it turns kind of a light orange and then a soft pink, and before long it turns gray and goes out completely. Completely cold. So he stares at that for a few minutes. And then his friend without saying a word grabs the same tongs, picks up the coal that's completely lifeless and he sets it right back in the middle of the fire. And immediately the coal burst to life, alive with flame, red, all the coals igniting it. And they just stare at it for a few seconds. And then the guy gets up, pats his friend on the back and he walks out without saying a word. And just before he gets to the door, our depressed friend stops and says, "hey, wait! You're right. I appreciate what you just said even though you didn't speak a word. Your sermon came through loud and clear. I needed that. I have grown cold, but I promise you this, I'll be back where I belong among my friends back in church this Sunday. I promise." - So what happened next? - Well, since you asked I watched my friend put his hand on my doorknob at the house. He opened it and he let himself out of my house and he walked into the cold night air. - That was you? - Yeah. That was me. And by the way, I've kept my promise. I've been back at church ever since, where I belong among my friends. Now when the struggles of life come my way and the cares of this world seem to weigh me down, I run to the place that can help me and not from it. Make sense? - Oh. Ok. Fine. You can all pick me up this Sunday morning. - All right! That's what I'm talkin' about! Shaggy! That was good. It will be good to have you back. - Take that. - Got any chocolate? - Little boy grabs his sister by the hand. He goes up to the door and he turns the doorknob and he opens the door. And then he sees this huge black coffin staring down at them, its mouth just opening and closing. Opening and closing. The little boy and the little girl they scream. They run to the bathroom. It's their last chance. They lock it and the little boy is so scared, he hops into the bathtub and he closes the shower curtain. And the little girl is in the corner just cowering, rocking back and forth. Well, finally she gets up and she opens the medicine cabinet and she grabs the cough drops and she throws them at the coffin. And it stops the coffin! - Lisa, that's awful! There was nothing scary about that at all. - Seriously. - I want my life back after you telling that story. - You can't get it back. - That scared me, you guys. - What? - What? - That scared you? Are you serious? - That scared you? - Hey. Hey, can you guys hear that? - Yeah, it sounds like a motorcycle or something. Who would be riding out in the woods at night? - Look. I think that guy just crashed! [Thud) - Let's go check it out. - My gosh. No! No! - Guys, is he ok? - What's going on? - Get away from him! Get away! Back up! Back up! Let me see your hands! Put your hands where I can see them! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to represent you. Do you have any questions? Do you understand that? - Your lawyer is here to see you. Over here. - Step back. - Let's see what we can do here. I got to tell you with this kind of evidence, you really could be in here for life. - Wait. There's something I need to tell you but -- can they hear us? - Yes, we're being monitored. Just a minute. Write it down. - There's no way. - Yeah. - Your attorney said you need to make a phone call. You got two minutes. - So you're just going to let me rot here in jail? It's not right. One man shouldn't pay for another man's sins. - Oh really?
