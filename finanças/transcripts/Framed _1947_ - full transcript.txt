50 miles from here who owns it fella named Cunningham when you leave this afternoon two o'clock if there's more hitch how could there be a hitch you said it was all set no not in my deal I mean the

button sewed on your dress is 2-1-1 clark street goodbye mine good luck looks alright kyon mr. price you've ever said truer word you know I never thought that Hill had anything left in it but rocks we'll have to send one of our men out tomorrow to look at the property it suits me fine now what would you estimate the excuse me coming him yes Helen Bailey on the phone I'll call her later she says it's very important all right hello Steve are you alone no then just listen there's a miner named Cunningham on his way to see you or maybe there already yes he's offered our man a job I don't know how he made the connection but he did I see yes it's a very sound idea thank you goodbye now I'll come again what did you estimate alone should be well they wear Effie greenie comes 3,000 uh-huh how's that sound well frankly it sounds like far too much no no no I suppose we could scrape you five thousand less and still too much I don't figured that way Cunningham you realize the bank can't afford to take a gamble on as big as some was that why not I paid back every red cent I ever bar and paid it on time this Bank knows me oh we can't do business out sentiment Cunningham this is not sentiment here's what I suggest a short-term note say three months shorter or $5,000 what they wouldn't even pay for the tool Shack what you're doing is turning me down oh I wouldn't say that Cunningham I've done business with this Bank for 15 years it's long before you came here long before you married your money long before you ever sat in that chair just gonna come this way you give me a lot of greasy talk then you turn me down I'm sorry you're not sorry but you will be they did lots time now I'm strong no loan what what happened I don't know exactly that no good vice president of the bank the deal was all set we suddenly just don't understand it was another Bank in town isn't there yeah there is sure if they won't touch a mining investment no I'll go out of town see old partner Walt Donovan he may be able to take me up a couple of thousand maybe more come on what about what about our deal is it still going well sure man sure does Mike do you know how things look if I'm not back in two or three days maybe better get yourself another job good luck to you Jeff you got new hat out of it anyway huh he's good at pretty even same hmm what do you have you got a match looking for someone in particular mm-hmm she quit last night good for her come in mic expecting somebody certainly not you I thought you're on your way I was well deal fell through oh I'm sorry so my maybe I shouldn't be sit down like I just left a lot Paloma see anything interesting how'd you quit your job I hope it wasn't because you got mixed up in my troubles oh no I was just tired you're a strange girl working in a two-bit cafe and yet you look like like what I'm trying to decide Mike yeah there's a bottle of rye in the kitchen no thanks sure I don't need it what happened did you swear off liquor in women maybe the deal meant an awful lot to you didn't it you don't want to talk about that depends on how you tell it oh it's a very short story money how much more than the bank wanted to risk what are your plans depends if y'all hang around a couple of days just wanna what get you up on things and then Vancouver Alaskan still running away not yet I can see several good reasons why I should stay put up my garage puller what's happened nothing to be alarmed about it's hardly five o'clock we've never come here this early what's the trouble it's not trouble it's just at the bank examiners are coming the day after tomorrow then there is trouble no well it's quite the usual thing but when they arrive they work about two weeks I don't want the delay I think it's dangerous I agree we can't wait that long how about your car plenty of gas on it yes Steve all right we leave it here in the garage lonely be for the night good darling what about the money you think I'd forget that course nasty but there's so many things it's in your safe deposit box all of it 250,000 they'll be searching for that money from here to Los Angeles and all the while it'll be right under their noses in my own Bank in your name now Poland under that robe you'll find a wrench now about your friend Lambert I'll get him here but remember it's your place not mine he still thinks I'm a waitress I want to go over this from beginning to end that sign dangerous curve on the right that's where I stopped and where you I know Steve yes I'm worried about one thing what's that what if they find something to identify it well as an accident there's usually a fire suppose there isn't it will be me nothing left to identify in Lambeth becomes price yes Steve just an for an embezzler let's take a look for the first time I really believe it's going to happen tomorrow night tomorrow night okay club open yep that's yours for ten bucks it's the same watch that still runs is it a deal okay drink huh 9 1 9 mana winner your

the fine $3 for room number seven $5 she gave me through whatever the $5 is for and here that's for your trouble Mike you're insulting no I couldn't insult you that wouldn't be possible you're drunk I

me pay is fine get in my room but for a laugh are you through yeah I'm through now I'm getting out of here you're getting out of here but first you're gonna tell me I got nothing to tell you what's the matter with you I was standing at the corner of 5th and Clark Street about an hour ago you fool a car stopped at the curb do you know who that was I don't want to know you got to know it was price who happens to be vice-president of the Empire Bank congratulations I didn't go for my sake I went for yours that's great doesn't the kind of CAM deal me anything to you anymore what about it I persuaded price to reconsider the loan he's going with us tomorrow to look at Cunningham's property you understand Mike you've got the deal yeah you don't have to believe it you have the appointment see for yourself what did you do to persuade him what's the difference no a lot of difference I don't want a woman fronting from me I wanted you to get the job I couldn't let you drift away pick up the money Mike how does a waitress at the La Paloma come to another vice president of a bank a lot of people come to La Paloma so I've noticed one way or another a smart girl gets to know in which closet they keep the family skeleton when she rattles out skeleton bingo where's the skeleton in the price family mrs. price but it's a long story going to stay to hear it where are your cigarettes same places they were last night have you finished those letters no mr. price you see those s never mind I'll sign them tomorrow I'm driving out to look at the Cunningham Holdings cancel all my appointments for today yes mister oh I want to see the examiners when they arrive first thing in the morning in our city long mr. Lambert a couple of days see aren't you gonna have one of your engineers look the place over a bank Oh mr. Lambert has to know a little about most everything I happen to have a mining degree hmm good enough suppose we take these samples back and have another assay drawn on them just for confirmation suit yourself it'll give us a clearer picture just a second I'll get something to carry to me everything working out mr. price I imagine so must seem a boring trip on the contrary I had to dump out Cunningham's laundry but he won't mind you know mr. Lambert I think I may have been too hasty yesterday telling him of course was a little rude I got angry naturally I don't think Cunningham meant to be well it looks good to me in fact I think we stand to make a little money well that calls for a celebration not a bad idea what would you like to stop I don't know this section at all I'll tell you what we might turn off to my place I've got a little shack up there I'm sure we can find the fixings I need something to warm me up and personally I'm awfully kur well one drink won't shorten a man's life appreciably now will it what a lovely place it's quite a Shack mega sounds comfortable lambeth they take your hat Thanks yeah I'll fix some tricks wonderful how would you like it miss Cregg water soda some sherry sherry what's good habit all right just a short one you know Cunningham's gonna be mighty happy when he hears about it yes I think we can do business here's luck and a little extra to all of us is anyone else hungry I'm famished let's go there ought to be a diner along the road somewhere nonsense I have all the staples in the refrigerator eggs bacon the usual things and perhaps miss Cregg would buy where's the frying pan right I'll
