- Eugene! Eugene! - Yes Dad ? - Bring back a Camembert for tonight. - Okay. - Sinking but not strong. - Heard. - And if it stinks like yesterday, tell the dairyman I 'm going to crush him on the face. - I'll tell him, dad. - No Camembert. - Why, no camenbert? - It's bad for your bitterness. - My "bitterness"! My "bitterness"! It’s you who make me bitter. - And soon their golden wedding. And they want me to get married! - Hi, Ballanchon. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Ballanchon. - Hello. - Hello professor. - One more minute, and he'll die. - Hello, Professor. - Hello. - Hello, Professor. - Hello. - So Oscar? How is it going this morning ? - Very agitated, as always, professor. - Tonight, we'll have to give him a sedative. - That way, Oscar will have a big sleep. Huh? - Drink well, it will drop the temperature. - Ballanchon worries us, Mr. Director. - He does not confide in anyone, he works in secret. - You know that's his nature. - He suckles little rabbits. Single, no children ... Small complex of fatherly frustration . Nothing serious. - This time, it's serious, he loses control. The assistant he fired ... says he's looking to experiment on his guinea pigs ... a mysterious gas. - Explosive? - Do we ever know. It would be an odorless gas, which would attack the control of the conscious personality. He would lift all inhibitions, all prohibitions. A gas of truth in a way. - If he succeeds ... - Are you kidding? - Not at all. What a discovery that would be for National Defense. My dear, with Ballanchon, you have to expect everything. - This time, it's too much. We will explain ourselves. He's an assassin, a public danger. Is Mr. Ballanchon doing his? He's going to see me coming. Ballanchon this time we will explain ourselves ! Sacred Ballanchon. One day you'll blow up the box, and us with, sprayed! disintegrated! What a pretty fireworks display! Definitely, with you, there is no risk of getting bored. Ballanchon, I must kiss you. See you soon. I leave you to work. See you next time. - It's not exactly what I was looking for, But meanwhile, it put him in a good mood. - What an extraordinary being. The joy of living with Ballanchon. What an exquisite, delicious, refined being. Ballanchon! Ballanchon! - Get that corrected for the signature. AlIo? Here? DST? Yes, I am not quitting. Hello? Yes hello. What? Ah, spies. You see them everywhere, spies. It is a vice. I answer for all my collaborators. But no not at all. If you are told that the Americans have the atomic bomb, know that the leaks do not come from us. - Don't go, he's furious. - I didn't expect so much. Am I bothering you ? - If it's to try your truth gas , I tell you: you piss me off, Ballanchon! - Yes Yes. I know, Director. I know, fuck you. But alas, it's not my gas that makes you say it. We're not there yet. - So what do you want? - I just wanted to ask you to breathe. To breathe slowly. Come on. Breathe. - Breathe. Breathe. Do you think I have time to breathe? that I want to breathe? When the DST imagine that we are a nest of spies. Ballanchon ... the situation is dramatic. You hear me ? Dramatic. Ballanchon ... There were leaks. - No ! So what ? - So... we are cut off all credit pending the outcome of the investigation. - It's not true. - 3 billions. 3 billion I was counting on ... Under one's nose. - 3 billions... - It's ruin. It's a disaster, it's a disaster. It is the Bérézina. - It's Waterloo. - It does me good that you are the first to know, because I have... I have such affection for you. - Me too, Mr. Granger. - Will you allow me to kiss you? - Yes. - Again. - It seems to work, my little thing. - What are you telling ? - I have the impression of having made a strange discovery. - Hello, Mr. Marchand. - Hello, Elise. - It's fantastic. a gas that makes you euphoric and good. It is the absolute weapon. You imagine a euphoric army kissing the enemy and singing the national anthem to celebrate the defeat. - It's a question of quantity. - We are saved. My fortune ... Our fortune is made. Give me the formula for your gas. -Ben... It is that. .. - "Is that" what? - I do not have it. - What? - Well, not yet. It's by dropping my cigarette ash in a preparation that everything started to bubble. That's kind of how Fleming discovered penicillin. By accident. - And is that all you have left? - Ben ... I know more or less the components. I will manage to analyze it. - We just have to hope so. Tell me, how long does its effect last ? - To see the look you are doing now ... about 1 minute. - It is insufficient, we must maintain the enemy at least an hour in a state of euphoria. Today, in 1 minute, we win a battle, but not the war. - A little more ... - No, unhappy man. No waste. I prefer to stay in a bad mood I'm used to it. First of all, to find the formula, you have all my credits. You have priority over other searches. As for your safety ... - Oh no. Especially no surveillance. I want my freedom. And no DST, eh. - As you wish. - You understand, I don't want to to be locked in a blockhouse. I have parents to support. I have to take care of it. - You have my word. For starters, what do you need? - Leave me alone. - You will have it. Ballanchon, still give me a little puff. Oh ! - Ok - Mr. Beauchard! - So show the Fort Apache model to Mr. Baron. - Hello. It's okay ? - In the cowboy genre, that's what we do best for the summer. - The edges are not too wide for my husband's height? On foot you don't realize you have to see it on horseback. - You think ? - The horse changes everything. - If Monsieur le Baron will take the trouble ... - You know, even on horseback ... - What do you want, madam, it's class. Let Monsieur le Baron find a reason for himself. Monsieur le Baron will never look like a cow keeper. Try the Mexican style at M. le Baron . You never know. I listen. - There's something new in the center. Ballanchon made a discovery which he describes as "extraordinary". I couldn't find out what. - Well done. - I was disturbed. I am wary. We're talking about espionage at the box. - There were still leaks in the leaks. What does your guy look like ? - Apart from science, it's not a light. - If you take him for a moron it must not be that stupid. We will have to be wary of this Ballanchon. - This time he's going to hear me. Ballanchon! - Your mission will be particularly delicate. Remember: he doesn't want DST. It is about protecting him without his noticing it. Ballanchon is an unconscious. And he's stubborn, the animal. - We usually. We were in the security service of the President of the Republic. - Ah! So... - If he continues to reduce credits like that, we will end up on a tandem. - To follow it would be more practical. - I told you not to breathe when I pass the second. After the slalom, high aerobatics. Definitely ... - Some blood ! - The women ! They are crushing you, and you have to pick them up. - That's the guy. He was spinning like crazy. A real racing car. He ran the red light and ran over the girl. - It does not matter M agent I have nothing broken. - And you think that's funny ? it's going to cost you dearly, my dear . Poor daughter. - It's emotion. It's nothing. Women pass out easily. - But you're a bastard too! - My God, what a shock. - I suspect it. - I was scared when I knocked you over. - It was you, on foot, who knocked him down? - No. I was in the car. - Ah! So the pedestrian was you. - No. Me, I did not start fast enough. - So you knocked her down. - No. It was I who knocked him down. - Enough politeness. Who was the pedestrian? - It's me, Agent. - You leave me alone! Well. So... Who was the pedestrian? - There was no pedestrian. - What? - I have never run over a pedestrian in my life, Agent, and I ... - So there, it will end badly. I'll take you both away. It is there, the bus, it is there. - But since neither of us are complaining . - In any case, do not come to be run over in my area. - Since I told you, Agent ... - that you saw a racing car. - I have seen everything. - Well, it's nothing compared to what you're going to see. Come on, the bus, the bus. - But but... - We need to disinfect your wounds. - These are just simple abrasions. - I have a first aid kit in my car. - My compliments. You are an organized woman. - Let's say far-sighted. - Oh, it's me which stretches it. - It'll sting, right? - Calm down. Haven't you broken anything? - No. it's okay, everything works. - No fractured skull? - No. I know how to receive myself. I took judo lessons from the universal school. I am a black belt by correspondence. - You are strong, but do not assume your strength. - Don't worry, I'm in great shape. - And then in 5 minutes you might collapse. - No no. - I live near here. Come and have a glass of cognac. It is more careful. - Careful, careful ... Do you think so? - But it's an order. - Ah. - I almost killed you. You are my first two-wheeler. - There, you're right, it's watering. - It's gonna end in a wedding. - You'll see, the grooms of honor gonna be good for night duty. Here, look. Here. - You are right. - With all those red lights, it's fucked up. - No. They have something else in mind than the performance index. - You look worried. I put you late. You can call from home. You are married ? - No, old boy. - "Old", that does not suit you. I prefer "single". Do you live with your parents? - No. They are the ones who live with me. - You're a good kid. - I don't blame them anymore for bringing me into the world. With age, you get used to it. - Pessimistic? - No. Optimism is seeing things as they are. We can only have good surprises. Me, I am optimistic, I always expect the worst. - With me too you expect the worst? I live on the 1st floor. I show you the way. Come in. Get rid of it. - It doesn't hold, your coat rack. - You are well equipped. - When you ride on two wheels, you have to have everything on hand. Then I am very handy. - Some music ? -Of course. - How do you like it ? - It's very, very pretty. Music is therapy for certain neuroses. - It's exciting. - Thank you. We had a very curious experience : we woke up an Indian pig to music. - It is charming. - Well, after a month, he was twice as big as the other lnde pigs. - This is terrible. - Influence of morale on the physical. - Do you work in a laboratory? - In a laboratory ? Why ? - Uh ... Well, you're talking about Indian pigs. - I love animals. - And apart from the music - loving pigs of India, what interests you? - Live. - It's not a goal. - Do you think so? - You do have a passion. - She's "number one", this kid. The American class, what. - I believe that we must take life as it comes, pleasure as it comes, and never ask questions. - Like all women, you prefer to ask others. - Him, with his average French "sleeping water" air , he doesn't inspire confidence in me. - He's pretty sneaky. - But do you think! It is the retarded infant who is still crying for his mother. She's going to swaddle him, the "baby". - You are strange, mysterious. - Only the mystery interests me. Our meeting... - It's wonderful, chance. - I don't believe in chance. - Ah. - It's no accident that you knocked me down. - However... - I'm not saying you did it on purpose. - I hope so. - But somehow, it was written. What do you think ? - I think it's disturbing to be like this, both... Without knowing who we are. - It is true. I don't know anything about you, or you, nothing about me. You could have had the face of my death. You will be a smile for a day. - Wait for me... poet. - We don't hear them anymore. How come ? We can't hear anything anymore. - I'm telling you that's a pretty good sign. In the pocket, the Ballanchon. - I told you that he was hiding his game, the scholar. - What do you mean ? - She'll have to go there. - She's not used to sleeping with the first comer. - You know something. - Relax, guys. Take it easy ! - Do not get impatient, I'm coming. - I've got plenty of time. - We can't hear anything. - He must be giving her his formula. - I'm telling you that the Solex is a girl's thing. - Here it comes out. - We haven't got home yet. - Let's go. - Ah! There you are, Eugene. - What happened ? - The house is in the dark. - Well, a breakdown. - No, your mother. - You're just a sweetie. - You would like to send me to the asylum. - It is not serious. The pellets have blown. - No, the pellets didn't blow. Weights do not jump. - So what ? - We blow them up. And who blew them up? Your mother. And why ? To piss me off. Perfectly. One day , your mother will blow up the neighborhood. - We had to put them back. - Monsieur is a good-for-nothing. - You would like me to electrocute myself, so that you can start your life over. - That's smart. - Leave it to me, dad, I'll take care of it. - You heard it, your mother, didn't you? Tonight, you were a witness. My life, you see what it is. - Yes. A short circuit, like the day before yesterday. - Having fought two wars, having escaped three times and find yourself prisoner of a shrew in a suburban pavilion, gosh ... - You shouldn't tell me that you loved me for life - My heart was bigger than my stomach. - It's here. Be careful, the boss wants us to bring him back alive. - There is no light. Maybe he hasn't come home. - Go see, Mario. - Come on, Mario. Quick ! - He's crazy, this guy. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. - Oh, my arm. - I assure you, I heard gunshots. - It was an exhaust pipe. - Ah, that's not enough for you? This time around, you will understand. - If we ever shot him , what are we going to take. Started ! Get into that car. Quick ! - When you have finished having fun, you can think about the light? - Yes Dad. - We're holding it back, your nimbus. - We didn't see where it came from. - A crazy. - A madman. - Hang up your guns and buy some guitars. You have a future as duettists. - to have it alive ... - It's not our job. - Because you think you're killers? And that criticizes the Americans. But in the states of guys like you, we wouldn't pay them union rate. I can no longer get used to small artisans. I will take care of it since in France you have to do everything yourself - So this time, understood. With this twisted, no zeal. We follow him from afar, we make presence. You've put on weight since yesterday. - No, but I took my precautions: I put on my little wool. - But what's going on? It's a flood. It was you who wanted to tinker? - No, it's your mother. - Where is that from ? - Ask your father. - Is that a pipe? - No, a tap. - What faucet? - the one your father refused to close. - It is your mother who opened it, it is your mother who will close it. Let's see It is terrible. I can't leave you alone anymore. - When you're there, she plots. And with me, she's having fun. - I don't have to turn off a tap that I did not open. it's a principle. - In principle your mother refuses to close anything, even its valve. - You opened the tap . - No it's you. - Besides, I couldn't believe my eyes: finally your father decided to take a bath. - Liar! I took one last Sunday. It was Mother's Day. I'd rather get the hell out of it. I'll drown it eventually. - That's it. Dry your feet before you go out. - Unworthy mother, go. - He annoys me, he annoys me, he annoys me! - Mom, please don't cry. There is already enough to mop up like this. - So far. - Professor Eugène Ballanchon please? - Take off your shoes and go upstream. - Where is it ? - Professor Ballanchon? - It's me, yes. - I'm from DST. I came on behalf of Mr. Granger. - Oh no, that's enough for today. - We've been tasked with protecting you. - You will say from me to that pig of Granger ... - Tell him yourself. He's waiting for you in my car, he didn't dare come. - I would like someone to leave me alone. It would be nice if they left me alone. - Do not worry. - He doesn't dare show himself? - Mr. Granger had to consider above all The interest of National Defense. - Is that so ? - It's okay, his Solex is there. - I bet he eats. - Well, we'll do the same. Ah! Ham. - Please excuse these somewhat cavalier methods . Think of them as a tribute. It proves that I don't take you for a fool. - It also proves that you are. With your gangster methods, what do you expect from me? - I do not live hope and I will explain it to you in a moment. I am convinced, professor, that you won't make me lose my self-control by forcing me to use methods that I myself disapprove of. I'll leave you one night to think it over. I'll meet you tomorrow morning, and I am sure you will give me the formula. You have everything you need. See you tomorrow. What is it ? - When I think all it takes is a shot or a gas so that you are a hero instead of a traitor. - What the French can be nationalists. - You send your information well. - Ah, sorry, Mr. Ballanchon. I don't pass them on, I sell them: nuance. - Oh yes, nuance. You are not a traitor, you are a sold - The richest are the strongest. The reason for the stronger is the better. By selling to the highest bidder I am always sure to serve the cause of intelligence. - Have you thought about the fools who could make you rifle? without trying to understand? - When you're shot for money, you don't die for nothing. Come on. And if you want to play Romeo, know that at the bottom of the window, I have placed two Juliets as effeminate as these gentlemen. Careful, eh? It's understood ? - OKAY. - 6-21 in half. - He cut his veins. - Didn't he do that? The boss will break us. Where is he ? Open! Open! - Well. This is not the right formula yet. Well, we'll see that later. You! What a surprise. - It's no accident. - It's still a chance. You see, everything happens. - They want to torture and kill you. So I couldn't. I had to warn you. - It is really nice. Thank you a lot. - You are in danger of death. - It's annoying. Today is Saturday, and I have to do the market for my parents. - I am taking you. Go up. Come quickly. - Well. Okay. But I take my Solex with me to maintain my autonomy of movement. It's all the same weird, that. - Sacred Ballanchon. He hid his game well - What does it mean ? - It's never too late to do well. - He starts to worry me seriously this one. Tell me, I'm counting on you, in the box. You watch me closely. - Don't worry, Mr. Granger. I will not lose sight of him. - So like that, you're a spy. I had never seen one before. - Beauchard's organization is commercial. He sells his information to the highest bidder. - Yes I know. And it is very sad. - What ? - To work without an ideal. - Summer! - No ! He's not going to do this again with grandpa! - It is indestructible. - This guy, always the same. - It was you who wanted ... - So I wanted to warn you right away. - What could have made you confess everything to me? - A kind of impulse. - So you have sympathy for me? - You are so ... different from other than ... - You're not going to say that ... That you... - Yes. - Well then... I would never have believed ... that ... So fast... - Since we left ... well... Here. - Wow. Anyway, listen, I don't have the look of a seducer after all. - Your intelligence, your ... sensitivity. Everything is expressed on your face. In your style, you are beautiful. - "Handsome" ? It's not possible. You get depressed or you take drugs. - Come on, enough complexes. - Look at me. That's it, I'm there ! It's gas. - How? 'Or' What ? - The gas. - "The gas" ? - Yes. You are conditioned by gas. - Is that so ? - At your place, I had an experiment. I made you breathe a gas. A certain gas which ... Finally ... I'll explain it to you later. In you, the effect is prolonged. - Eh yes. - What is your blood type ? - Group A. - I suspected it. So by adding nicotine to the formula CH 227, there is a continuation on group A of evolutionary inter-reactions, and as I am from group 0, it is easy to mate. - You have a funny way of talking about love. - Luckily we warned you. - I told him to go pick up Ballanchon at his house. Where are they now? - In any case, my information is precise: every Saturday he comes here. - Come on, "go", you. - Don't hang around. You are not safe here. - You can't imagine a ratatouille without tomatoes. So there you would have heard it, father. Now I need parsley, garlic, shallot ... Hydrogen, nitrogen ... sodium chloride ... the effect of the gas therefore resumed delayed, exactly like the Indian pigs. When you go to bed, have you felt ants in your paws? Finally, in the legs? - No. But I felt the need to come and tell you the whole truth. - "The truth." - Yes. Come on. - I'm approaching my goal. You are an exceptional subject of experience . It's all a matter of gas density and dosage depending on gender and libido. You have to be careful in doses. - Warning. - What? In doses? - No. There in the car. - Ah! - Here it is. Back off! Step back, he will shoot! He's sick! - He's capable of anything. He had to be taken by surprise. - Break his paw, but not his head. Not the head. - Warning ! - So what ! - Warning ! - Oh no. It's finish. No. - The police ! Always to be involved in everything. - Are you afraid of it? - I want someone to leave me alone. - Come on, hurry up. Let's get the hell out. You finished turning, say? - Come on, come on. - So what ? - I did not see it. - Do not touch me. It is a mistake. It is a miscarriage of justice. Not the handcuffs! Not the handcuffs! Colleagues, colleagues ... - It's extraordinary. - It would be enough now after analysis that I can rebalance the components of the gas mixture. - And there would be no more war. - Maybe not. It would only be a question of product density. - That's wonderful. You are a real scholar. But you scare me a little. - Why ? - It's impressive. All it takes is a little chemistry to create love. - It would be better, of course, that, on Earth, a lot of love allows chemistry to be dispensed with. But it's not yet finalized. - You think ? - Hello, dear madam. - Hello. Come in. - Thank you. Mr. Ballanchon is there? - Yes, yes, he's here. - Sir ... I address myself with emotion to the parents of a man which I consider to be one of our strongest national values. - We were going to sit down to table, but too bad. Go for it. - But after all, madame, sir ... World peace is in danger. Who is the manager ? Your son. - What did he do, that asshole? - The poor kid. - You must help me protect him, despite himself. Eugene Ballanchon, one of our most remarkable researchers , just made a discovery. - Eugene discovered something? Him who is not even screwed to find a good camenbert. - This discovery is of interest to National Defense as well as a mysterious spy organization. - My son's secrets don't interest me at all. - You're not proud of him? Eugene is a failure. - A scholar. - It's the same. In other words, a criminal. - Oh ! - What do they bring us, your scientists? Huh? Because of them there will be no more birds, more fish, more flowers, more vines ... and more Beaujolais. In addition, we will all be radioactive. Let's talk about your scientists! They can't even cure us of a head cold and they want to go to the moon At least we may have peace on Earth. when all the idiots are in the moonlight. - We work for the greatness of France. - France will continue to grow well on its own. Since the Gauls, France has grown up without you. Without you having to bottle-feed her. - Here is. Now you are under my protection. Only, I warn you: it will give them a strange blow. My father is annoying, but not a bad guy. - I see myself in the obligation to withdraw. To the arguments of reason, you oppose your anarchist reveries. - He's not an anarchist. Their bombs, next to those of your scientists, these are the firecrackers of July 14th. Me, I would have been an anarchist at 20. But I went wrong. I met Madame. She was 20 years old. Curvy, beautiful legs, but that day, I would have done better to break one. - Don't be careful, he's hungry. - Believe me, marriage is no laughing matter. - In life, you have to choose: either you are happy, or you laugh. - "Happy" ... Do you call that happiness? In addition, we generate an atomizer of underdeveloped population, an executioner of Indian pigs, an assassin. What is that ? Oh it's you. - Precisely, we were talking about you. - What are you doing there ? - That's what I'm wondering. - I heard you got to know each other. - Um yes. - I present to you a little comrade. Miss ... What's your name again? - Régine. Régine Leclerc. - "Régine." It's lovely, isn't it? - Eugene you're not serious. You didn't even know his name. - Well, here it is, that is to say ... - For a woman the name does not matter since they take ours from us. I'm sorry, but a woman, there is enough of one at home. I thought my experience would have taught you a lesson. - Mom, you're not going to do it again. - Given the profession you practice, let me tell you, your demeanor is rather light. You should select your relationships a little better. - And you, Mr. Granger, I advise you to better monitor your employees. - Who are you talking about? - From a certain Merchant. - My secretary? - Yes. He's a spy. - Marchand, a spy? It’s terrifying. And who told you? - Régine. - But how does she know? - She's a spy. Finally, I'll explain that to you later. - He already took himself for a scientist, there, he takes himself for James Bond. The OSS and the 007 , these are guys! If I want to see real spies, I go to the movies. - That's it, go take a walk that will change our ideas. - You will have to be examined by a psychiatrist. - Mr. Granger ... beware of calm. - What a family ! - We didn't ask you anything. We must not come and piss off the world at home. - Gentlemen! Gentlemen! - I am no longer surprised that your son is not normal. - I am an unworthy father, a thirsty, a loudmouth, but I am also an assassin. - You're welcome. - Your father is a monster, I don't want to see him anymore. Let him go to hell. - But hey, come home. Come on, gentlemen. What does it mean ? Let's go ! - Eugene, we're kidnapping your father. My teddy bear, my beautiful teddy bear. - For example! - Eugene what are we going to do, Eugene? - I'm taking care of it. It will cost them dearly. - Indians ! - Thus ends the Attack of the Indians, first part of our show. Don't miss our next attraction: Brawl in the saloon. - I wish you a good weekend in my little amusement park. Today customers are jaded. Dreams, that's what they ask for. They are big children. And the husband who takes his mistress off on the weekend is happy to imagine himself on Monday that he slept with the sheriff's daughter. Your stay together will be absolutely free. Provided that your collaborator, Mr. Eugène Ballanchon, give me all the information I need about its discovery. - He himself does not know the formula. - Yes well I'm convinced that he will find the formula! And quick. Because he likes his "daddy", He wouldn't want us to hurt them. We're going to ask him what he thinks about it. - You are wrong. A dramatic mistake. - My word, he has the sweeties. No no... - Hello ... I would like to speak to Professor Eugène Ballanchon. From Mr. Beauchard. - You will see how I will stuff myself, me the Ménilmontant bitterloc. - Do you want to shut up? It's not the moment. - I did Verdun, I'm more afraid of the Redskins. - Yes, I'm waiting. Hello? Mr. Ballanchon? - Yes it's me. - here Beauchard. - Is that so ? - I'm calling to give you news of your little world. They are all in good health. For the moment. It's up to you to keep them in good shape. It’s no fun for me to torture people. I'm not a sadist, but you have to live well. Give and take is a principle. Fortunately I have some left. - What should I do ? - You will give me the necessary documents, and after verification and control of the experience, the charming trio will be released. - I'll call you to make an appointment. - Heard. I'll put all the pieces together ... As soon as I have completed a small experiment in progress. - My poor Marchand. What a pity that my truth gas is not yet fully developed. A small nasal spray would have been enough . Without any suffering, you would have taught me where Beauchard is and what is its headquarters. So we'll have to find something else to make you talk. Unfortunately, it will certainly be much more painful. - Not that. Not that ! - To a certain extent, this is fortunate for me. I am a sensitive scholar. I love animals too much to bring myself to make them suffer. So you are happy for this last experience. - No ! No ! - You will prevent me from sacrificing a poor little rabbit who never hurt anyone. - I'll tell you everything. - Ah, you see ... - I don't blame you, Régine. You didn't have the shoulders. It wasn't your job. While in Caracas, you will make your way. Do you understand ? - There isn't a morning for us today. - Well done, my little Ballanchon. - It's funnier than the Guignol. - Quick. - Since kindergarten, I had not played that. Wait. Wait for me. - Hurry up. - And now the sheriff is me. Goodbye. - Hey, you wait a minute. - Come, follow me. - Chut. The exit, please. - It's over there. - Go Go go ! Hurry up. Oh ! Oh there ! Come on, let's move on. Go! - We have to catch him. Come on, quickly, on horseback. What are you doing ? Faster, damn it! Faster ! - Oh, look how beautiful it is. - Oh, look at the horsemen. - Come on, dad, faster. - Here they are. They are there. - Come on. Come on. - Do you see them, grandpa? - I got it ! - To storm ! Charge! To storm ! Let's charge! Forward! - Oh is. Oh it is. Where is he ? - Oh damn ! - Hey ! hey friends Where are you ? Hey, wait for me. - Here. Look at the. - Come on. - Look !
