What's up? Freeze! Don't move, you little bastard. What are you doing? Don't fuck around. I said I haven't got the cash. That right? Fine. You wanna give it to me now? Or do I have to kill your brother? TURIN, ITALY, 1983 Did you like it? Or do you intend mulling over what you've seen for hours in silence? I don't know what to think, to be honest. Full of Latinos shooting guns, you know? I like shoot'em up movies. Yeah, I knew that already. Come on! You like shoot'em up movies and suicide. You exaggerate too much. Shall we go to my place then? You're joking. I've got an exam first thing. I don't like "sleep" on rny own. I don't like sleeping on my own. You're to blame for my terrible Italian. - Yeah, sure. - Su re. Did you know you learn a language best in bed? To bed. Hi, I'm not at home, please leave a message. Ciao, non sono a casa, per favore lascia il tuo messaggio. Hi, buddy. Hey, are you there? Come on, answer, damn it. I have to tell you what happened with that girl. It was great. Call me back when you can. Hi, Hector. I don't know if you remember me, Silvia Blair, one of your dad's students. I'm a teacher now and I wanted to talk to you. I guess you know your dad is retiring from the university, right? Wei I, a group of students and ex-Pupils would like to pay him tribute, and I imagine you might want to join us. It's important to him, I think, he's not too good right now. - Hi, gorgeous! - Handsome! How are you? You're looking good! Why are you so skinny? - Aren't you eating? - Of course I am. It's because love keeps you trim. And marriage makes you fat, just take a look at me. Don't talk nonsense, you look lovely. How did you keep my mum from coming? - Hector Joaquin! - Mum! What a joy! Quiquin! - Good to see you. - You're so thin! Not you too? I'm the same as ever! Let's go to the car or we'll be late. Sol and Dad are on their way there. They wanted to come and pick you up too, but you know how it is here. It must be the first time ever for a plane - to arrive in Medellin on time. - You bet. The ceremony today will start on time. They were lucky to be given somewhere to hold the ceremony. They don't want Dad there. They dismissed him out without notice? No, he was given notice. That vice-chancellor simply unmasked himself. Dad still acts like a rebellious student and not like a respectable professor. You see, everything's the same, nothing has changed. - But as for you...! - Yes, you! You're all so beautiful! Maryluz, don't I look a bit dishevelled7 - What are they protesting about? - This week, who knows? You were never an easy person, let alone as a professor. I remember, at first, we didn't know what to make of him. We asked ourselves, "What kind of lessons are these?" What kind of strange professor is this? Rather than offering certainties, "he spends all lesson raising doubts." You set out more questions than answers, and that left us in the dark... You were the first person to dare to speak about public health in this country, when we thought that was for the Yankees or the Europeans, but never for us. Sol. Your knowledge of social medicine was sustained by your passion for anthropology, for humanism and politics. Today... is a very sad day for the university. Silencing the voice of a unique professor... If you'll excuse me... Mum, the silverware is ready! No, not that one, love. We can't use the everyday silverware. Fetch Dr Saunders' silverware. That vase is lovely! Gordo, can you come and give me a hand? - Hang on... - Look, I got... Give us a hand, Quiquin, they'll be here soon. What's that? If your dad sees you playing with that gun... Right, how are we doing in here? They're here! They're here! Dad! - God, they're here! How's my hair? - It's fine, you look fine. Stop running around, Héctor Joaquin! Dad! Go downstairs. Richard, how nice to have you here. Thank you. I hope I'm not too much trouble. Thank you very much, Emma. You can serve the Josefa, we were waiting for you. She takes care of the young children's education. - Very good, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, mister. Dr Saunders. - Carry on, Josefa. - Excuse me. Didn't you say you didn't like it? Which you need. I want to hear about San Francisco. - Yes, so do I. - Well, I spend most of the day at the university and I don't know what goes on in the city. Is it true it's full of hippies? - Yes. - What are hippies? "Strange" people. Listen, "strange" people. What kind of "strange"? Girls, let the adults talk. Dr Saunders has come to work with me on a project called Futures for Children. The children's future. It's a study on the different social aspects in several rather marginal neighbourhoods. - Can I go with you? - "Can I go with you?" I know that trick. Anything to get out of studying. - Why not? - Why not? Your friend is to blame. When Quiquin had to go to nursery, he started crying, and daddy was so desperately sad, he decided to keep him at home all year. Really? - How about that? - He was so small. - Small? He still is. - And spoilt. - He's this small, and doesn't grow. Hey! - Don't hit her. Have you washed your hands? Come on. Go and fetch Tata. - From your hands... - Excuse me. All the bacteria you touch during the day can get into your mouth. So then, Dad, can't I go with you? No, not so fast. Don't be in such a rush. Otherwise you won't get all the dirt off, look. What's that song that Marta likes? The one The one she dances to? - Yes. - The one about the dead man? That's the one! Sing it and wash your hands till the song ends. - Tata! - Say hello! Do you remember Dr Saunders? Hello, ma'am. How are you? - Tata! - How are you, ma'am? You see... It's a shame, she can't hear very well. - Yes, such a shame. - She can't see either. Marta, please! Show some respect for your elders. Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom God's love commits me here, ever this night be at my side to light and guard, - to rule and guide... - Don't say it so fast Hector goes fast. Children, you don't pray to God just for the sake of it. You pray consciously, thinking carefully about every word you say. Not as if you're reciting the list of your favourite soccer players. - Does my dad pray at night? - Concentrate, Hector. My dad doesn't pray at night, I know. Yes, much to my regret, your father doesn't pray at night, which is why he'll go to hell when he dies. Because he doesn't pray and doesn't go to Mass on Sundays. Will I go to heaven? Don't worry, I'll see to that. Don't worry, my dear. Sol! What are you doing? Don't look at my hair! It's a mortal sin to look at a nun's hair. I'm sorry. Hey, what are you doing? It's my bed! You know what? I'll never pray before bed again. - What? - Good gracious, Héctor! How can you say such things? I don't want to go to heaven if my dad isn't. Rd rather go to hell with him. Goodness, Hector, hush! Kindly stop talking nonsense. Go to sleep! Go to sleep, the pair of you! - Will you please, go to sleep! - To hell... in commune one, then commune two and commune three. Excuse me. Look, what lovely stories my son writes. Quite an author. A Nobel prizewinner-to-be. Hello! - Can you give us some money? - Please. - To buy a few important things. - Ask your mother. - She isn't in. - She's at work. She left without saying goodbye? She didn't want to interrupt. - You are all so busy. - Working. My wallet is in my briefcase. All yours. - Thanks. - Dad, can I have some for an ice cream? Of course you can, love. All I have is yours. But remember, your dad is a professor... - Yes. - And we are poorly paid here. - See you later! - So, don't spend too much. She's coming. Run, run. This way. - Fatso! - What? - Are you sure they're Jewish? - Yeah. Hebrews eat bread. What? I heard my parents talking about it. Josefa says that the Jews killed Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Ready? Run1 - Stinking Jews! - Stinking Jews! Fatso, pack it in. They're here. - Hi! - How did it go? Very... - Darling! - Hi, Dad. - Has everyone been good today7 - Very good, as always. - Is Mum back? - Yeah, she's inside. But Mum hasn't been very good. - What happened? - She made me eat porridge. I'll have to have a serious talk with her. All those kisses and cuddles. Is your dad gay? Don't say that, Fatso. - All gays kiss other men. - That's not true. Yes, it is. Come over here. Keep quiet. Guess how many times they can hap their wings in one second. - Twenty times. - Up to two hundred times! - That's impossible. - My dad told me, he's a doctor. - Is your dad a doctor or what? - Doctor Queer. Are you crying? She's crying, look! - You're silly. - Silly? Don't be rude. - I'm so silly. - No, you're not. Sit to the table, the soup will go cold. Leave her alone. Just a moment. Hector Joaquin, come on, we have something to do. - Doctor Abad! - Good evening, Mr Manevich. - How are you? - Fine, fine. My son has come to apologize and assure you it won't happen again. Sorry, Mr Manevich. Say it louder. I'm sorry, Mr Manévich, I won't do it again. I promise. - Good night, Doctor. - Good night. Sorry for having interrupted. Good night. He came to say sorry. Do you remember Clarita Glottman? No. Clarita was a classmate who became the first female doctor to graduate from the University of Antioquia. She was Jewish. The first thing the Nazis did to the Jews was break their shop windows. Then they tried to exterminate them in concentration camps. Have you ever seen photos of concentration camps? Clarita's parents died in one of those camps. One day, I'll show you photos so you know what they were like. - Tomorrow? - No, not tomorrow, Tomorrow you can come and help Richard and me. Be careful, Quiquin. Careful, love, get down. Look. Here's a water sample from the brook. They need drains, vaccination programmes... This is a disaster. If that was all that's needed... Clean water saves more lives than the best of surgeons. Why do you think the Romans placed so much importance on aqueducts and drains? Camilo, come here! Camilo, come over here! - Come on! - How are you, madam? - Good afternoon, Doctor. - May I ask, - how old is your boy? - He's twelve, Doctor. He's the same age as my son, and look... This is the first step to inequality, and from hereon... I bet you've all forgotten what I say in class about the five needs. - The five needs? - Exactly. What a human being needs for healthy growth: air, water, food, shelter and affection. The vaccines? Tell him. Silvia, tell him. Yes, it's astounding how the government still hasn't authorised vaccines which have been used in the US for many months. We're always way behind. What a disaster! Dad, what's wrong with this girl? Hunger. Make a note of the districts in which each child lives. That will help us to map out the epidemic. What about this girl? - What's wrong with her? - She's hungry. It will come as no surprise. Where there is no sewage system or where they drink milk mixed with river water, that's where you'll find the typhus epidemic. What about this girl? She's hungry, that's all. They're just hungry. Your dad better not find out you're noseying around. Yeah, I'm out of here. - Are they going to bring a dead body? - Not today. We're not dissecting today. What a pity. Is everything all right? - Hello, Gilma! - How are you, dear? Fine. Isn't Dr Abad here? No, but he won't be long. - Leave it over there. - Thanks. - Hi! Nice to meet you, - Hello. - I'm Hector. Like my dad. Could you give this to your dad? - Sure. - Give him my regards. - Thank you. This is lovely, look. - My mum makes them. - Really? - With loving care. - What are they for? For putting candles in. - See you again. All the best. - Bye, dear. All the best. Gilma... Why did lie bring this? Did you ask him for one? No, dear. Your dad helped him a lot when he started his studies. He's a humble lad from a faraway village. So, every time he goes there, his mum sends a gift for your dad. Gilma... Are you married to my dad too? No, my dear. Whatever has got into you? Your dad is married to your mum. What's this photograph doing here then? Because I got married by proxy to Ivan, my husband, who's in Mexico. Your dad represented him because Ivan was over in his country. Do you know what I mean when I say I got married by proxy? - No, madam. - Well, dear, you get married and somebody represents the absent person. So, you did then, you married my dad. Well, all right. I guess so, but only a little bit. "The town of Medellin: a national disgrace." Don't touch that, love, your dad hasn't finished it yet. "The aqueduct spreads typhoid fever bacilli" "and the authorities are doing nothing about it." It's an article. - For the newspaper? - Yes, my boy, for a newspaper. Will everyone read it when it gets published? I hope so, my dear. Or hopefully at least by those who need to read it. Here you are! Come on, Hector, I bet you haven't let Gilma work. Dad, this is from Miguel's mum. Miguel, right? The student. Such a dear lad. You keep it, Gilma, so we don't have to carry it home. - No, Doctor, I... - I'm not going to argue, - I've had enough for today. - But... Enough for today. - Let's go. - Bye, Gilma. Hello, Rosalia! - It's been a long time! - Hello, Doctor. I know, I've been very ill. How are you doing? - I've got something for you. - You're a good man. Remember what I promised? Go ahead, go ahead! I hope we took the right measurements. If you have any trouble with it, let me know. It shouldn't rub or hurt at all. How will I know, Doctor...? No, it's simple. Help me with your skirt. - That's it. Careful. - Is that it? Then, you just cover it up. How will I ever pay you? It looks perfect! I read the article you're writing for the newspaper. Really? What did you think? - Turn, turn... - But, what are bacilli? Bacillus is... a bacteria that can only be seen through a microscope. - Remember the samples we took? - Yeah, sure. That's it. When we studied them under the microscope, guess what we found. - Bacilli. - Exactly. I'll show you the photos later. Dad, what I really want to see is a dead body. Hector, I told you, you're still too young for that. Get out. And open the garage. Of course, the dead go to hell if they haven't been good. God is strict about that. What if they've been good but they don't go to church? - What? - Well... what happens if they've been good but they don't go to church? Do they go to hell too? Look, Hector. You're not going to fool around with me. You're going to church tomorrow, the same as your sisters. He says he doesn't want to go. Doesn't he? With his mother then, the archbishop's niece, see what she says. Sunday is sacred, Héctor. Breaking the third is just as serious as breaking the rest. - The third? - Yes, the third commandment. Good Lord, this blessed child... He won't learn. Quiquin, you can't go out like that! Dad told you not to go out without your helmet. I can do as I please, it's my bike. Hector, don't be rude. You're too young to do as you please. What if you fall and crack your head open? Hector, here. - Do as your sister says. - No, Dad! I'm the only fool who wears a helmet. It doesn't matter. It's protection in case you fall. He hasn't even finished his homework. Leave him alone. Hector, come here. He's so spoilt. He's so rude. How about teaching him some manners? All in good time, Josefa. Doctor, tins boy needs a firm hand. Don't worry. Life is hard enough, there's no need to make it any harder. - Come here. - Dad, no. Listen... Don't ever hit your sister again. - You prefer her? - No. Marta is your favourite. She's good at everything: violin, - guitar, she sings... - That's not true. You must protect her, and all your sisters too. You must never hit a woman, not even with a rose petal. Go on then. What? Does it look like Chinese? It looks like Arabic or Indian. It's called shorthand, love. People speak so fast at meetings, so I have to make notes like this. - How did you learn? - That was many years ago. At the Remington School for Girls. Have you done your homework, Hector? - He hasn't even started. - Because Dad always lets him off. Finish it at home, we're going now. - Okay, Mum. - Quickly. Girls, tidy away, time to go. Yes, madam. Haven't you read his article in the papers? Don't be fooled. He's filling the university with Marxist ideas... They go on and on about him being Marxist. He blames the authorities... Mum, are they speaking ill of Dad Of course they are. - He's just as dangerous... - Get off. Stop it. Fortunately, the ecclesiastic hierarchy has taken the matter on board - and they have signed... - They can't taint the image - of a good person like my dad. - Let me listen. Hector Abad Gomez. Mum, they're talking about Dad. - Let me listen. - He can't write articles full of atheist maxims opposed to healthy customs, capable of destroying morale... They're destroying people's morale! Be quiet, all of you! Inciting rebellion and chaos. They don't know him. Those were the words of Father Fernando Gomez Mejia... There he is! He's here! Girls, say hello to your uncle the archbishop. - Hello, Uncle! - Good afternoon. Hello, Uncle. My word, my niece's children are so grown up. There are two girls missing though. Yes. Clarita and Maryluz. One is away studying and the other is at university. Murn... Did you really live in that palace? What do you think? It's the tops. You must be young Hector. The little fellow. - Hello, Uncle. - Yes, he's the only boy. Is that right? Will you do me a favour? Tell your father I'll drop by on Sunday so we can have lunch together. Thank you. He'll be so happy. God bless. - Amen. - See you soon. - Bye! - Goodbye. Good Lord! Imagine your mum running about the halls and chambers in such a palace. She was like a little princess. No. It wasn't the best place for a girl. Not with all those priests. Why did you live there then? She came to live with me when her parents died. And she's never stopped behaving like a princess ever since. - Sapota ice cream! - Wonderful! - A palace recipe. - I'm running a bit late, but I'm not missing this for anything in the world. When I was courting your niece and I was invited to lunch at the palace, I was usually given rice pudding for dessert. You have to earn the good things. - It's delicious! How wonderful! - It's nice. No one knows how to make it like this anymore. Héctor, I explained to Cecilia that I signed that document without reading it. I didn't know they'd use it against you. I told him already. You had every right to sign it, if that's what you think... Against a member of my own family? Of course not! The thing is, Hector, your attitude, at times, - Quite frankly... - Look, Father, doctors are here to heal, to walk the streets visiting whoever needs us. We can't limit ourselves to prescribing pills in our surgeries. I understand that. I just hope that amid all those humanitarian ideas you don't forget your duties as a good Christian. Don't worry, Father, I try not to stray not even an inch from the work that Jesus Christ demands of us. All the same, I must remind you that Christ was by no means vociferous. Neither am I. Neither am I. I simply talk about what I see. I wish others would do the same. No one went to fetch Tata! We forgot about her. Poor thing! Quiquin, can you go for her, please? She must've smelt the sapoti ice cream and gone... Have they left you here on your own? Do you want to come with us? I want to see the archbishop, I want to see the archbishop. Lets change the subject, please. - Yes, please. - We're boring the girls - and Josefa. - Don't worry, Father, I'm used to it. The Nuns of the Annunciation were so kind to let us have Josefa to help you out, don't you think? Of course. And we are so grateful. At first I was against the idea of Cecilia working... But when I saw what you were earning, I realised I had a family to maintain... And she was right, Dad. What? Look, here's Tata. - Tata! - Lovely to see you. So lovely, Tata. So lovely... Of course Josefa is right! You must go to church every Sunday. And you should go to keep your mum happy. Even though it's all a lie, like you say? Even though it's all a lie. We both know that if God really exists, lie won't worry if we worship him or not. I believe... that humans are as important to Him as parasites are to doctors, observing them through microscopes. - Like bacilli? - Exactly. But you must do as your elders say. - Daddy, read us a story. - Sweetie. No, love, its late, sweetheart. - Please, Mummy. - Please, please. - Come on then. Hector... I'll take her to bed after. This is the story about the lad! Right... Come here. Once upon a time, there was a lad who was madly in love with his teacher's daughter and he wanted to invite her to the ball, but... when he asked her, the young girl stated her condition: to take her to the ball, he had to give her a beautiful red rose. The lad ran around looking for a rose, but he only had white roses in his garden. Poor lad. So, feeling desperate, naturally, he began to cry. But listen carefully... as he wept, a nightingale heard him from the tree and decided to help him to... win his loved one's heart, I guess. - Sure. - Of course. So, the nightingale pricked itself, like this... It pricked itself with a thorn from a dry rose bush underneath the boy's window, staining the rose with its blood. - What? - The next day, the boy saw that a beautiful red rose had bloomed under the rosebush below the boy's window. He cut the rose and ran. - Run, mate! - But she was, you know, very haughty, because she was the prettiest, and she turned him down again. She told him a rose wasn't important... - What? The other suitors had offered her better gifts to take her to the ball. Dad, what story is that? - Is that the end? - That's how it ends. - Is that it? - It was really sad. Wei I, it would be worse if the boy were still in love with someone who was only interested in material things. - Yes, but... - The sad thing is: we're up late and we have to get up early. Time for bed. Bedtime for everyone. How many Our Fathers has Josefa prayed without you? Come on, Héctor, hurry! Quiquin, my love. - You left your lunchbox. - Thanks. - Be good! COMMUNIST I must express with great respect that I have never conceived my professorial position as a renunciation of my rights as a citizen and the freedom to express my ideas and opinions. Gilma, can you do "shrorthand"? My mum can. Shorthand. Don't disturb her. Sorry. "Ideas and opinions..." Ideas and opinions... The university cannot turn a blind eye to the real problems of Colombians, isolating itself from people's distress, maintaining privileges and methods which sustain social injustice. Type it. Type it. Tell your sisters to give us a hand with all this. Marta! Marta! Now step to the side. Now twirl me around. Now you. And now me. Good heavens, Hector, we must be careful. Some of those youngsters will turn up tomorrow to suspended lessons. So what? Call them and tell them. Where in the world do you think you live, Cecilia? In Europe or Japan, damn it? Do you think everyone lives like we do? You think those kids have drinking water and telephone? No. Murn. - Are we rich? No, we're not rich. What are we? What are we? We are what? Well-off, I guess. What do you mean, well-off? I don't know... Or maybe your dad is suddenly rich, because he never thinks about money, but I'm not that lucky, you know? I don't know. Hector Joaquin, can you go with your sisters, please? - Hector... - Hector... What's wrong? Mum and dad are arguing. Do you go spying on people now? I wasn't spying on them. They were having a row. Don't you realise what's going on? Dad's been kicked out of the university. What? Why? What happened? Did he get fired for not believing in God? Something like that. What's the matter? Are you angry with me? No, it's not that. My dad's going to work in another country. Seriously? Dad, don't go. - It's all right. - I love you. I know, honey. I love you. I love you. Look what I bought so we can keep in touch, live. - Live. - Yes, like we're all in the same room. - A microphone? - Very good, Solvia. - What's that? - Look, I'll send you all my recordings because I'll buy another of these gadgets, but only if you promise you'll send me news back - Of course, we will. - Like a spoken letter. Exactly. I'll record everything on there then. I'll be sad, but I'll send you tapes too. Of course, record everything. - I'll send you all my songs. - Of course. Hector, hurry up, you'll miss your flight. That's enough, girls. I'll be with other teachers. Hector, come here. He's being childish, he won't come. Well, be gentle with him, okay? Hector, come and say bye to Dad. One last hug, my darlings. And look after yourselves. Take care. We'll miss you. - Bye, my darlings. - Bye, Dad. - My darlings! - Don't go. Dad, bring me a hat, please! Bye, Dad! I love you! - Bye. - I love you, Dad. - Bye. - Bye, Dad. My darlings. Hector, don't worry, I'm sure your dad will be back soon. Teresa, promise me you won't wash this pillow, okay? Why is that? So it doesn't lose its scent. This lad says some funny things. Dear Dad, I want to tell you what's been going on lately at home. Tata... Tata doesn't live with us anymore. She couldn't even blow the whistle anymore. So, Mum put her in an old people's home. She says she'll get better care there. Although Marta thinks she's going to die soon. - She's very old. - Bye, Tata. But Josefa is still here, she'll never leave! I do what you said: I pray with her so she won't keep on at me. But I sometimes have nightmares because of the stones she tells us. "Lord, I beg you, don't let her die, Bring her back to life." Mum is working more than ever I've been going to her office to do my homework whilst she finishes I sometimes help her by dictating the minutes of the tenants' meetings. You'll never believe it, but I'm even learning "shrort" shorthand. Last week, Mum sent me to the farm, and I helped to pick the fruit that the birds hadn't eaten. I had a super time. Maryluz has got a boyfriend, I think, because some lad brings her home on his motorbike and when he leaves, she giggles and her hair is untidy. Clara, however, has broken up with hers. One afternoon I saw her crying, and they were all comforting her. As soon as they saw me, they kicked me out of the bedroom, as usual. Mum is always telling them to forget about boyfriends and to concentrate on their studies. A woman with no qualifications is doomed to depend on a man. - What do you want in life? - I want to get married. You want men to take decisions for you? But with those songs Marta sings all the time they can't help thinking about love all day. To get into Mum's good books, Vicky takes her breakfast on Sundays and says she prepared it, even the orange juice, but Teresa is the one who does it all really. But Mum believes the little liar, and I guess she's her favourite now. Mum has decided 'll go to a new school next year. We went to see the principal, Father Hoyos. We have very strict rules here. He explained that the waiting list for future students at the Jesuit school was split into three groups. - For example... - One: the Heaven's drawer. In here we have the applications of those who will be accepted directly. And the other is the Purgatory's drawer, where he put our application. Where we shall put your son's application, because we have to run a thorough check of his records. We want to make sure he isn't under any bad moral influence at home. That's when I saw Mum get angry, like when someone goes against her. This is the Hell's drawer. This is where we keep the applications of those who will never be accepted. Put my son in that drawer once and for all, Father, I shall enrol him at another school. Thank you. Goodbye. So, Mum decided on another Catholic boys1 school, one where cousin Javier works. He introduced me to the other boys and told me we'd soon be classmates. I'm sure you'll like it. My dad says the world. Wasn't created like that He says it was cosmic fate, a unique and unrepeatable moment, that's why nobody knows his destiny. It's best if you keep those things to yourself. And you needn't worry, because your office is in order your pencils are sharpened and ready for when you return. And like I promised I read a page of the History of Art book every day. A fond farewell, yours dearly, Hector Abad III. You'll probably wonder why I sign off as the third. It's simple: because you are worth two. Here you are. - It's lunchtime. - I'm coming. I'm working! Working? Get it done quickly then, we're all sat at the table. Hurry up! In Bali they love doing craftwork, figures, necklaces, - sculptures... - Look at this. Appreciate what they make from wood, ivory, coconut shell. Making beautiful objects helps them forget about poverty, and the hardships they are suffering. - They seem happy. - It's so pretty. They weren't taught about guilt and sin like us. Anyway, my darlings, I must say goodbye now. A big kiss to everyone. I miss you ail very much. - We miss you too. - I can't wait to come home. Hector, don't forget, even if Josefa insists and only wants to read the dramatic stories about Genevieve of Brabant to you, you should read a poem by Machado - or Neruda before you go to bed - I don't know why he says that... Listen, listen... If I ever live again, it will be in the same way, because I could repeat my wrongful birth and come out with another shell singing the same tune. Which is why, if it should happen, if I am forced to be reborn by some Hindustani fate, I don't want to be an elephant or a rickety camel. By some Hindustani fate, - I don't want to be an elephant... - An elephant. Or a rickety came! - But a modest prawn... - A prawn. A red drop in the ocean. I want to make the same mistakes in the bitter water. Be shaken by the wave - as I have been by time. - By time. It's that one, it's that plane! Look, look! Yes, yes! I told you, it's that one! Yes, what a joy! When is he coming out? I want to see him. There he is! - There he is! Dad! - Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy! Have you seen him? Look, he's put on weight. Are you happy at your new school? Happy? That's impossible, Dad. Don't tell your dad lies. Dad, look. Rosalia is over there. How's things, Rosalia? Hello, doctor and family, how are you? - What happened with the leg? - Doctor, everything's fine, I use it at home, I get around fine with it. But for work, you know hat people are like, I'm better without it, but it's fine at home. Thank you very much. May God reward you. - All the best. - Bye. - The big ones over there. - What have you got in here? Is it seriously 28 hours to uncle Rafa's house? Yes, that's why we're leaving now. Everyone, get in the car. Why isn't he coming with us? I'm going with Dad tomorrow by plane. That's not fair. - We're ready to go! - Mind your fingers. Your fingers. I've left your tickets on the bedside table. There's food in the fridge. Everything is ready. Don't forget your ID. Yes, love. Do as your mum says. - Bye, darlings. - Do as your mum says. - Get there quickly. - Bye! - Bye, you little rascal. - We're on our way! - Bye, Dad! - Bye, little rascal! Little rascal! Quiquin, I love you, even though you're a rascal. How peaceful. Isn't it, Dad? It is. - It's delicious. - Yes. - Don't you want any more? - No. I'd rather feel a bit hungry than really full. Moderation is important, don't you think? That's the secret behind vaccines. Putting a small dose of the disease inside the body so the body learns to fight it. - Really? - Yes. I've brought several doses of a new vaccine that could put an end to polio in the world. And which hasn't been used anywhere yet. But... if we prove it works, no one will oppose to it. And we'll be able to set up a national prevention... programme. So, I'm going to need your brave collaboration to save the lives of thousands of children. My collaboration? Remember the sick children in that hospital? Yes. From this moment onwards, you are essential for the future of this country. I didn't know you were occupied. I just wanted to check you haven't got a temperature. No. I'm fine. All right. What are you doing, going to sleep? The flight only lasts an hour. - Sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Did I ever tell you about when I was studying my final year of Medicine? Cousin Luis invited me to his house. - Fabio's dad? - Yeah. Fabito must have been about your age at the time. The thing is, after lots of beating about the bush and secrecy, Luis told me he was really worried about his son. Really worried. Just imagine, all the lad ever did was wank himself off. All the time. Morning, afternoon and night. Non-stop. Of course, Luis was very worried and asked me for help. Guess what I did. I went to talk to Fabito and I said, "Son", come here. Carry on doing what you're doing because it's no harm to anyone and it's quite normal in a lad of your age, but let me give you some advice: don't leave any evidence. And most important, don't let your dad see you." Sometime after, cousin Luis called me, he was very grateful because I'd convinced his son to give up that bad habit. Fabito. Oh, man. Fabito. Go on, jump. No, no way, Solvia. That's enough. - Don't be a chicken. - No, no, let go! Protect yourselves from the sun, it's beating down! Yes, Daddy. Have you all put Yes, we've all put some on. What's this? Has a doctor seen this? You're a doctor, aren't you? When it suits him. The neighbour had flu and he wouldn't even go and check in on her. Its best to get it looked at. - When we get back. - You know what? Josefa always says they're like rosary beads. They are a gift from God. - Josefa! - What does Josefa know? Chicken! Look how high I jump, and I can't even swim. - And you can't even do it. - Go on, do it! Solvia! Solvia! Hold on! Help! - Solvia! - Help! - Sol. - What? She's fallen in. She can't swim. Run, see what's happened. Solvia! Pass her to me. Give her to me. - Breathe. - Thanks, lads. Be careful, love. It's all over, Sol. It's all over, my love. Why didn't you do anything? She's all right! She's all right! Make no mistake, we aren't here to change the world, but to teach those who may in the future. You're just the same as all those oligarchs. Are you one of them or what? We can't change things without a fight. I'm a doctor. My job is to save lives, not to put them in danger. Dad, today there's a dissection lesson. - Can I see the dead body? - Be quiet, please. You're the last thing I needed today. Come on. Bye, Gilma. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, Doctor. Do you fancy going to the pictures? Okay. FASCIST PROFESSORS Son, another serenade tonight. They're dressed up smart. - Turn, turn! - These are the serenades Which King David sang To the pretty girls... Good evening, Doctor, I hope we're not troubling you. Good evening. No, not at all. Alfonso. - Alfonso, nice to meet you. - How do you do? Just one question: which of my daughters are you here for? For Clara, sir. Right, Clara. I thought so. - Good night. - Good night. - Didn't she have another suitor? - That was last week. Clarita! You know what? I prefer this lad, he's less... The other was too ambitious. He had a really cool car though! Yes, but men who are too ambitious are never faithful husbands. Wake up, my dear, wake up Look, it's dawn The birds are singing The moon has now set Héctor. Héctor. Hurry, get dressed. I want you to accompany me. I want to sleep. Feliciano. - Doctor Abad. - How are you doing? - Fine. - My son, Hector. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you sure...? - Yes, don't worry, he's a big boy now. She belonged to the student movement. Did you know her? Only by sight. Doctor, may I? The stab wounds are here and here. And the two knife wounds, here. Frankly, there are no signs of violence or a struggle. Perhaps they wanted it to look like theft. Feliciano, could you send me a copy of the report? - I assure you, I'll be discreet. OK, doctor. Calm down, calm down, my love, it was just a nightmare. - You were dreaming, Hector. - What's wrong, my love? What happened? It's all right, I'm here now. - I'm sorry, will you forgive me? - Yes. It's all right. Good morning. From the San Vicente de Paul Hospital during vaccination day, accompanied and sponsored by Doctor Hector Abad Gomez and the University of Antioquia. Given people's mistrust, I like to practise what I preach, so the first to be vaccinated were my own daughters. Prevention is the best medicine. - Thank you, Doctor Hector Abad. - Thank you. That was Doctor Hector Abad Gomez from the San Vicente de Paul Hospital - During vaccination day... - Heroes don't boast. Go away, go away, love. It isn't a good time, Hector. Has a bomb gone off? It looks like it. Who's been killed? I don't know. Did you know Clara kissed Pablo, but he grabbed one of her boobs, so she finished with him? What's wrong, Dad? Where are we going? I'm not sure whether you know, but... Your mother asked me... Your sister Marta lias a melanoma on her skin. It's a very serious illness. And she'll be undergoing strict medical treatment. Is she going to die? No, man. How can you think that? She'll be in the hands of the best specialists so we'll have to go to the States. What I... What I want to ask you... is for you to be strong. And don't tell anyone. And treat her very well. Yes. It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. - Let me see. - Hang on. Right. Spit on here. Watch my hand. You dirty swine... I did what you said. Gross. Right, take a look. - Can you see things moving? - Yes. - They are bacilli. - What? Bacilli. And they're in my mouth? It's gross. - It's cool. - Yeah. I've never seen my saliva so close up. They're like little worms. How gross. - What? - Let's go, let's go. Careful, careful, sweetie, careful. Sorry. - Excuse me. - This way. Where is it? - This way. - This way, Dad. Yes, here. Great. Darling, come here. Our first grandchild. - Here. - No, wait, I'll wash my hands. Hello, my love. - Hi, Mum. He's so cute. - Darling. - I want to hold him! - Lets see. Gently, be very careful. Careful with his head. - What cute hands. - What's the matter? - What's the matter? - Where's your auntie? Look, this dimwit is your uncle Hector. He looks like you when you were a baby. - No. - He does. Remember, darling? I said he looked like Pope John XXII, but you said he looked like that Russian guy. Not that Russian guy. Nikita Khrushchev, you were identical. How beautiful. What about Grandma? - Happy or not? - So happy. Tired of waiting for these two, they took so long, they've been together for years. There, there, sweetie. - Hello! - My darlings, look at this little beauty. - Look. - Gently... He looks like Quiquin. - Murn! - He's big and beautiful. Congratulations. Look, Clara. There, there. - Sweetie. - My sweetie. See if he calms down with you. There you go, gently, gently. - I know, my love, I know. - What is it, sweetie? He's got a good pair of lungs! You hold him, to calm him down. - No, I'm afraid of dropping. - No, hold him. Hello, my darling. You'll sing again, my love. You'll play the guitar again and make us happy with your lovely voice. - I'll give her more morphine. - Okay. Fetch a syringe. - Héctor, I'm not sure... It's ready, Dad. Has it been sterilised? - I suppose so. - You suppose so? You want me to use this on your sister? All surgical instruments have to be sterilised! Daddy, what's wrong? How many times do I have to say it? Damn it! Infections are the most dangerous things in the world, the most dangerous. That doesn't matter anymore, Hector. It does matter. Rejoice. Rejoice. God often hurts us by taking away what we love the most, just to remind us how much we owe Him. I can't take any more. - Our joy must be... - Hector. Our recognition of God's greatness, this gift of life which is granted until He calls us to His side. Easy, dammit! Bloody hell! - Help! What got into you? - I didn't see her. - Madam! - Help! Fatso! Get out, give me a hand! Stop, stop, stop. Help me, please. Guys, get her in the truck. Careful. Let's go down route 80, there's a hospital. Take it easy, bro. Let's go. Follow us to the hospital. I swerved. Hang on, look. - How is she, Doctor? - She's seriously injured. We're trying to get her stabilised to take her to the Medellin Clinic, they have an ICU there. His dad's a doctor, - Professor Abad Gomez. - Good heavens, man. Look, this woman is critical. I have to write up a report. The Police will probably come and take you to Bellavista Prison. Bellavista? We could be talking manslaughter. Is there no other option? Look, I want to help you out. We could say you're in shock, I'd hand in a report and you'd be taken to the insane asylum. Why don't you talk to your dad and decide what to do until the Police get here. No, we'll leave my dad out of this. What have you done to your arm? He did it in the accident. Come on, I'll see to that. Your dad didn't teach me, but I had to accompany him on several visits. I remember once, at the prison, he had an argument with the governor because he wanted to put inmates with tuberculosis with healthy ones. - That sick bay was chaos. - Doctor, the lady, is she going to recover? She has a broken shin bone, calf bone, and several ribs. She also has a fractured pelvis. It will depend on how strong she is. Do it, do it, son of a bitch! Do it! Goal! Do it, do it, son of a bitch! Pass it! Goal! - You got a ciggy? - No. Doctor, a ciggy. I haven't got any. I'm not a doctor. - Doctor, you've got... - I'm not a doctor. I haven't got any! Do me a favour. I need to phone home. Vicky, Vicky, listen. Tell Dad that if he doesn't get me out of here, I'll go mad for sure. Quiquin. I left some food in the fridge for you, do you want to eat? No. Where's your dad? He's shut himself in his office. Why don't you go and talk to him? I'm sure he'll get over it soon. Yes? How does that feel? - Fine. - Good morning. How are you getting on? How nice to see you here, Doctor. - Slowly, slowly, be careful. - Careful, Dona Betsabe. That's it, hold onto me. My son was embarrassed about coming to see you. That's over with now, Thank God. What was a tragedy is now a blessing from Our Lord. He was irresponsible, but he knows it won't happen again. - Isn't that right? - Yes, I'm so sorry. Speak up, Héctor. Dona Betsabe... can't hear very well. I was saying, I'm sorry. Don't worry, thank you for everything. Thank you, Doctor. We've finished the exercises for today. - Good. - I'm so grateful. You found a job for my son and it's changed our lives. - God bless you. - Don't worry, it's all right. Truly, it's been an honour meeting you. No, the honour is mine. How are things around here? To be honest, we're rushed off our feet. Actually, if you could accompany her... I have an appointment at the university but I'm sure my son can, right? - Yes, no problem. - Good. Congratulations on your progress. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Doctor. - Nice to meet you. - God bless. Mind your head. That's it. Thank you. Well, take care, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. All best. - You're welcome, bye. - Goodbye. You're still here? Yeah, they took ages in corning to pick her up. Yes, the poor woman sat waiting at the entrance for hours. Well, thanks for everything. Are you going downtown? No. Me neither. I don't know why I said that. But maybe we could go for a drink? Yeah, sure. Shall we walk? Do you remember the bomb they placed next to the station? I was a kid. I was luckier than my mum and my little brother. We've had no news in two months, we've heard nothing from anyone. I kept telling him, "Son, don't get involved in politics." All right. All right. Doctor, he loved you so much. He was very dear to me. He always told us about your greeting at university: "What have you thought about today?" Madam, we need to know whether your son received any particular threats. Someone he knew perhaps, who may have warned him, or who came to talk to him. No. I don't know, honestly. He just used to say that he was fine, that lie had a lot of work, that he had a lot of work with his lessons. He didn't say anything else. Right. You've grown up, man. I haven't seen you in a long time. What happened to this guy? No one knows. He was a teacher and a trade unionist. And you know, life isn't worth much in this country. You drive. Bye. What about you? Are you going to be a doctor like your dad? No, he's going to be a great writer. That's what he says. You know your dad was the worst doctor in Medellin? His first gallbladder operation: the patient was buried four days later. The operating room wasn't his thing. But the streets were. We all have to find our place. And he will find his. There are lads who don't have a father. Yet you have had too much of one. Leave him alone. Bye, Alberto. This morning I heard they placed another car bomb and two people died. Really? I didn't know. That's why I'd rather not listen to the news. Well, if you intend being a writer, you'll have to see the real world from time to time. - Not reading all day. - Don't start, please, we've a two-hour journey ahead. Son, if everyone were to do the same... - I don't care. - Fine. Those bastards can take the whole country and stick it wherever they want. I'm going to accept being chairman of the university professors' committee. Things like this are unacceptable. Right. And you're going to sort it all? There's an oriental proverb I heard years ago which says, "Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness." The only candle I can see lit around here is your vanity. - You think so? - Yes, I do. Since Marta died, other people's problems are of more concern than your family's. Other people's problems? Can you hear yourself? Problems aren't just other people's. Bloody football, damn it! It's the only thing people take seriously here. More deaths and people talk about football. - Shall we talk football? - Lay off. - We can talk about your team. - Lay off, will you? TURIN, 1983 Excuse me. You haven't missed anything interesting. I'm afraid so. That accent of yours? Colombia. Medellin. Yes. I'm Colombian too. But my mum is Italian. You like shoot'em up films and suicide. Suicide? You exaggerate too much. Hi, I'm not at home, please leave a message. Ciao, non sono a casa, per favore lascia it tuo messaggio. Hi, buddy. Hey, are you there? Come on, answer, damn it. I have to tell you what happened with that girl. It was great. Call me back when you can. Hi, Hector. I don't know if you remember me, Silvia, Silvia Blair. Today is a very sad day for the university. Silencing the voice of a unique professor. Which is why we want your voice to be heard, here. Hector, please come and say a few words. Thanks. Thank you, Silvia. No, my dear Silvia, it would only be a sad day if the end to my classes marked an end to my duties, which isn't the case. I must admit... after so many years at this university, receiving a letter notifying me of my compulsory retirement... made me feel very empty, very sad. I have taught very little. If anything, I always tried to teach my students to think freely. But we make so many mistakes when teaching others when we lack the maturity and the common sense which come with the experience gained throughout life. Knowledge itself isn't wisdom. Wisdom alone isn't enough either. We need knowledge, wisdom and the goodness to teach others. And now that I have readied this point, maybe, now that I begin to see things clearly, which I didn't when I was young, I get kicked out. I know many will be wondering, "What will Doctor Abad Gomez do now?" "He won't have those lessons which made him so happy." Well, I can tell you. I shall dedicate all my efforts looking after the roses in my garden. Dad, don't cut any more, we've got enough now, I think. - You think so? - Yes. Your mum is quite baroque, you know? And she's so happy when you come and visit. If you want to make mum happy, you should spend more time with her. Don't get involved in things. Look, just because I've been let go, doesn't mean my hands and feet are tied. I don't think you should be playing at being a rebel at your age. I don't wish to stop being a rebel. I've never got on my knees to anyone. Haven't you? But I only kneel before my roses. I'll smother her in kisses, I'll smother her in kisses. Hello, my love. Mum, look how pretty. I'm so happy. They're beautiful. - Where's Grandad? - Come here, come here. Gosh! Hello, my little sweetie. My love! Hello, hello. I'll give you a piece of advice, now as we're almost 200, right, Cecilia? If you want your children to be good, make them happy. And if you want them to be even better, make them happier. He still thinks that everything in life can be solved with happiness. It can't. You know what Quiquin said to me when lie was small? He said, "Mum, tell Dad not to adore me so much." We've come... for nothing. I'm afraid today's conference which was going to be given by my good friend doctor Abad Gomez, will not be held. - No, you can't do that. - Please. Please, listen. - Lessons can't be taught... - Why not? Lessons can't be taught under army surveillance and under threats from the guerrillas. You must understand that classrooms aren't places for control, they are places for freedom. What's going on? Listen to us! We know that the Bomboná Battalion... is behind the latest crimes against university leaders. We are up against shameless psychopaths with a state salary, paid by all Colombians. In this morning's protest, these were the statements made by Doctor- Hector Abad Gomez. Maryluz, Hector, quick, they're interviewing your dad on TV. Exterminating intelligence, the most restless students are disappeared. They are killing political leaders, assassinating priests committed to their towns and parishes... Your dad is making very powerful enemies. He doesn't want to be killed, right? Under the pretext of the fight against terrorism. You can't take away people's right... I sometimes think so too. To happiness, to live happily. - Do you know Ivan? - No. How you doing? Nice to meet you. What should my dad do then? Turn a deaf ear, like everyone else? No, it's not that, mate, it's just... Well-meant talk won't save this country. Let's go to the vice-chancellor's office! Justice! Justice! Justice! We experience it, we feel it, Manuel is present! - We experience it, we feet it... - Careful. Manuel is present! Violence is born from cowardice. Make no mistake. For saying these things and defending my ideas I'm branded as Marxist by the Conservatives. And I never read any of Marx's works. And I'm branded as Conservative by the Marxists. When I have always pursued freedom. You know what I am? Just a doctor. Which is why I side with life and never, ever... with assassins. Dad, no one would be worried about you if it weren't because we all know how dangerous your commitment is right now. If I get killed for doing what I do, - wouldn't it be a lovely death. - What? Leave the martyrs for religions. I can't believe it. This conversation is making me sick. Can we talk about something a bit more pleasant? Dad, you're not liked here in Medellin. Darling, lots of people like me, but they don't move in your circles. I'll take you to meet them one day. Murn, where's Teresa? She only conies a couple of days, we have to watch our expenses. Your dad may not realise it, but I do. He's rich and you aren't. You clown. What Maryluz said worries me a bit. You know what people round here are like. No one will do anything to your dad. Bye, Dad, I'm going now. Bye. - Mum's asleep, okay? - Okay. I remember when you took me to see it. I didn't understand a thing, I fell asleep. Its about beauty. In the end, all we seek is beauty. I would like to announce that I have decided to run as candidate for the office of mayor of Medellin. If the members of the Liberal Party choose me, I will be delighted to stand for the elections. Doctor Abad, how would you ideologically define your candidacy? Are you on the right or the left? As a doctor, I know my heart is on the left, so that's where my feelings are. But my brain is in the centre, along with reason. And I'm pretty sure about what is on the right: my gallbladder. In other words, bile, hate and aversion. Why have you decided to take this step right now? Getting involved in a political candidacy when even party members do not support you. Look, this morning, right here, they killed the president of the professors and teachers' union, Luis Felipe Velez, just before entering his office. Needless to say, this crime is the work of those who aim to silence us, those who directly attack the university and knowledge. The paramilitaries are doing as they please, like a strike force aiming to crush us. Someone is pointing out the targets to them, make no mistake. But it is our duty to raise our voices, and say that we will resist and we will be present in Colombian public life. If there are no further questions, thank you for coming. Thank you. Doctor, one last question, please. How does the party view your candidacy? Well... Don't you say hello to your friends anymore? Gabriel! Fatso, how are you doing, man? I didn't see you. Were you here? Sure, you're as blind as a bat now! I see you got a job. Journalist. Whatever comes up. - That's great. - What about your novels? Well, I do whatever I can too. Listen, will your dad give me five minutes of his time? I don't know, I guess so. This is all a bit out of my reach but hang on a minute. That's what I said to the reporters. Dad... Well, gentlemen... Thank you. - All the best. - Thank you for everything. - Do you remember Gabriel? - Gabriel? - My friend from round the block. - Gabriel! - Doctor. - Well, what brings you here? I wanted to ask you a few questions. Yes, of course. Doctor, may I...? Go ahead, record it. Did you ever get to see this? Let's see, what is it? What is it? A list of people under death threat That is going round Medellin. And your dad is on it. It's a long list. The assassins seem a bit ambitious. There are journalists, politicians, lawyers, writers. Even Carlos Vives, the singer, is on there. Can you get me a copy? You can keep it, Doctor. Look, I'll be honest with you. I'm proud to be on this list. Well... Aren't you afraid of the Death Squadrons? Of course I am. Who would want to be killed? I want to die an old man, surrounded by my children and grandchildren. I don't wish a violent death on anyone. - Doctor Abad. - Madam. Sorry to interrupt. Why don't you go to the teachers' union to pay tribute to the leader murdered this morning? Well, that's a very good idea, yes. I'll tell Betancourt and Aguirre to come with me. But first I need to make a few notes for tonights radio programme. - Let's go then. - Well, Mr Journalist, - Look after yourself. - Gabriel, come round to our house and we can chat. Okay. Who is she? No idea, I don't know her. Hector, I forgot to ask, how did your university appointment go? Did they find you a job vacancy? No. What do you think to that? All those people you've helped all your life and no one lifts a finger. Don't worry, one day, they'll be the ones calling you. I assure you. They might need someone at work. We can go now, I'll introduce you to the managers. Fine. I heard about the list of death threats. Weren't you going to tell me? I heard it on the radio. Right. Hector, you need to fix a meeting with the mayor, he can tell you more about these threats and how real they are. Yes, we've got an appointment with him tomorrow. We're going to prepare a press release... A press release? Do you think they mean anything? No, no. Don't worry. They're coming for me. Shall we meet up later? No, you haven't eaten anything. They're waiting for me for the tribute to Luis Felipe. - Will you be long? - No, Cecilia, it's around the block. I'll come round when I'm finished. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. I can't understand why he keeps getting involved in these things. At his age. Rather than enjoying life, going away together. Doing things together. Doing things together, Hector Joaquin? Your dad and I haven't done much together since your sister died. Who is that woman? Do you know her? What if dad is cheating on you with that woman? You clown! I've got an appointment Right. - Carry on up the street, that way. - Yes, don't worry. Thank you. Well then... - How's your wife? - Very worried. - Sure. - These are uneasy times. Yeah. - There aren't many people. - No, it doesn't look like it. They're inside maybe. - Doctor. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Doctor. Have you come for the funeral? - Of course. - Of course. He was taken to the funeral chamber two hours ago. Why did that woman tell us...? There's a demonstration this afternoon. Get him! Get him! I don't know if you remember my son Hector Joaquin. Of course I do, Doha Cecilia. He must be a big lad now. - You wouldn't imagine. - I remember him as a small boy. Here he is. - How are you? How's things? - Good. - Nice to meet you. - Excellent. May I? Well, son, weren't you in the States? No, I was in Italy, studying. He was studying Literature. But then I told him that the company might need someone. The only literature you'll find here is the minutes of the meetings. And they're boring. - My partner has arrived. - How are you, Doctor? I've just had a terrible scare. What's happened? Some hitmen have just killed a man. I was in my car and I saw them flee on a motorbike. Medellin isn't safe. Who have they killed this time? Was it nearby? Round the corner, two streets down. Horrific, its so dangerous. Listen, son, how old are you? Twenty-eight. Hector! They've killed your dad! - Mum, what do we do? - We have to go! They're his shoes. His shoes! - Don't come near, madam. - Quiquin! The sons of bitches! They've killed him! The sons of bitches have killed him! No, no, please! No! My darling. Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! No, Alberto! Go away! Go away! You have to leave. We don't want more deaths. Leave them alone! Please! He was here just now, he was here. No, no, don't take him away. My sisters haven't arrived yet. It's best if they take him away. No, my sisters have to see what happened to him. We'll sit on his body if we have to. The judge has ordered the removal of the body. What happened? What happened? Daddy! Why don't they pick up the phone? Where are they? Hello? What's wrong? Dad? No! I knew it... - No! - Mum, what's wrong? - No! - Mum, what's wrong? - Murn, what's wrong? - What is it, Mum? - Mum! - What's wrong? Why are you crying? Your dad, honey... - My dad? - Your dad is... No, honey. Don't do that, honey! How can they kill such a good person? - Doctor... - I'm sorry. Why? My deepest sympathy. Be strong. Those are his clothes. Doctor Abad was a man who was detached from religion, critical of hierarchy, but not of Christian ideals. You know...? Dad was right. But his values kept him united...
