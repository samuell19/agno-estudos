THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, AND THE ENTIRE FREEWAY WAS CLOSED DOWN WHILE CREWS WORKED TO CLEAR THE WRECKAGE. AND IN OTHER NEWS... HURRY, KELLY. THE TRAIN LEAVES IN AN HOUR. JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE. POLICE AND FIREFIGHTER INVESTIGATIONS LAST NIGHT, WHEN A FIRE BROKE OUT IN THE BASEMENT. THE FIREFIGHTERS QUICKLY CONTROLLED THE BLAZE, BUT A GRUESOME DISCOVERY WAS MADE IN THE CHARRED REMAINS OF THE BUILDING. THERE WERE 6 BODIES FOUND... 6 BODIES? ALL PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE. INVESTIGATORS... IT CAN'T BE. ANYTHING? NOTHING. NO SIGNS OF A BODY. LIKE A PHOENIX FROM THE FLAMES. NOT EXACTLY. LEADS DOWN TO THE SEWER SYSTEM. WHERE HE BELONGS. OFFICIALS HAVE CONFIRMED FATALITIES, BUT IT IS STILL UNCLEAR IF THEY WERE VICTIMS OF THE FIRE. STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF THE FIRE STATION, I TALKED TO INVESTIGATORS INSIDE. THEY ARE ENTERTAINING THE POSSIBILITY OF ARSON. MOM? MOM! THERE ARE TWO SUSPECTS THAT ARE BEING SOUGHT IN CONNECTION TO THIS INVESTIGATION, BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NAMED AS OF YET. THIS IS BARBARA WINTERGREEN FOR NB TV. AAH!
