Miss Lee. Good evening, Mr. Chester. You sure you know don't know what this party's all about? No, darling. I honestly don't. - Hi, boss. - Good evening, Harry. * For Lani's eyes have told me * Please darling don't let him upset your evening. To end the mystery of this surprise party, I am your host tonight. My name is Roger Kong. A very dear friend of mine has written a song about the Islands. I heard it the other night and loved it. That is why I have arranged this premier presentation. It is called the "Polynesian Rhapsody". It is about a man's great love for Hawaii. Mr. Chet Chester. Hawaii, I came. Unwilling, a stranger to you. Sick and weary, bitter and tired. All hope dissolved, heart despairing. But when hearing music, I opened tear-sodden eyes. And beauty and color rushed to embrace me. To warm me, to heal me, To make me whole again. And the murmuring waves and tropic trade winds Beat into my consciousness an unceasing rhapsody of tide, muted hollow. When rain drops perform silver ballet over white-skirted sea. What are you doing back in the Islands? Unfinished business. Business? Your business ended when Chet broke up the syndicate four years ago. The partnership of you, himself and Roger Kong was over then. He paid you both off. Maybe I want to get paid off again. What does the "or" and the question mark stand for, Mr. Novak? That either he leaves, so that I can start up the syndicate, And everything that went with it again, And run it all by myself with a free hand. Or... a hundred thousand dollars in cash and I'll leave the Islands. And if he refuses? Case history of Chest Chester. This could get your boy locked up for the rest of his natural life. And you would go right along with him. Yeah. But I've got nothing to lose. But Chet, he held on to his dough. He's got plenty to lose... everything. However, for a measly hundred thousand, this will disappear. Land of Aloha, of song, of welcome. From Pali to Kaneohe Bay. Languorous, idyllic, where trade winds play. Where all races are one, with one another and God. Where joy is in the living. Where paradise is now. Island of contentment, of tranquility. Of full heart and happy laughter. You have given strength to me who had lost it. Restored my faith where faith had waned. Made strong my body, which was all but withered. Made harmony in my soul, a man of me. I love you. I will never go. I love you, Hawaii. You are my life, my hope, my faith. With your bright and shimmering music-filled loveliness, You are my golden dreams at the rainbow's beginning. Why did you want to come here? You dirty rat. Please, darling, let's get out of here. No, you never get anywhere running away. You understand, don't you, Chet? I had to do it to protect you. As long as he was around, you'd never have been safe. Never. His heart was so full of hate for you. Yeah. And blackmail. Did you read this? No. No, I don't want to. I know everything about you I want to know. Except one thing I could never understand. I've never liked Novak. Why did you ever become partners with a man like him? It was nineteen forty, before the war. I was a stupid kid. We pulled a bank job in Riverside, California, Novak and I. Cops were after us and we had to split up. I had the money. Well, when things quieted down, I looked for him, but I couldn't find him. I joined the Navy, and before I knew it, I was shipped out. How'd you happen to meet him again? It was after Pearl Harbor. I sent for him. Well, it was better for me to send for him, than to have him find me. You know how it was around here during the war. The town was full of people with money, easy money, Just asking for guys like us to take it away from them. So, we took our dough and formed a syndicate. We needed somebody in the Islands with connections, so we found Roger. Novak and I supplied the money and the brains, Roger the connections. Well, now that he's out of the way, You're the only one who knows about my past. I never told Roger. Even if he knew, Roger wouldn't hurt you. Now listen to me, Sally. Listen carefully and don't argue. That note was meant for me. If I'd gotten it first, I'd have done exactly the same thing. I killed Novak. I did it in self-defense. He tried to blackmail me. There was a scuffle over a gun. No, I won't let you. You're to do exactly what I say. I can get away with this thing and you can't. Why can't I? What would you tell the jury? I'd tell them the truth. And get put away for ten, twenty years? Not you, Sally. But I want you to be safe, Chet. I'll be all right. Now listen and do what I say. You know that box at home that has our safety deposit box key in it? - Yes. - Would you take the key And go to the vault in the bank and take out $50,000 in cash? But you'll have to wait for two or three weeks until things cool off. - Two or three weeks! - At least. Then go to San Francisco and see George, my lawyer. You know the address. I know his one abiding passion... cash. You give him the $50,000 and he'll get me off clean as a whistle. All right, Chet. I will. Oh, darling. Darling, I love you so. I've loved you ever since that fist day. And I remember every day since. Aw, don't worry, darling. I'll soon be out and things will be good again. You don't have to do this for me. I owe you too much already. When I was burned and out of my mind, you found me. You brought me back, you and these islands. Oh Chet, what do we do now? The same thing anybody does when they're in trouble, phone the police. I love you, Hawaii. You are my life, my hope, my faith. With your bright and shimmering music-filled loveliness. You are my golden dreams at the rainbow's beginning. Did you like the record? - Very much. - What's the matter? You are my golden dreams at the rainbow's beginning. It's very strange. I can almost swear... You could almost swear that what? Golden dreams at the rainbow's beginning. There's an interesting story about the composer. He's over in Honolulu awaiting trial for murder. Murder? Donna? Uh, Donna. Wait a minute. Donna? Donna, what's going on? I wish I knew. I see you're bringing Randy back from the dead again, Or are you going to tell me that old story That you've never been able to quite believe he is dead? Read that inscription. But I've told you over and over again, you have to be wrong about him. He was killed at Pearl Harbor. You received official notice from the Navy, didn't you? You mean the last line of that... Polynesian Rhapsody? Yes. It was just a coincidence, that's all. I've got to find out whether it is. It's crazy. Can't you get it through your head, he was killed? Frank, I simply have to make sure. I must! He must have been quite a guy. He was. But that isn't the point. What is? Calling off our engagement? Frank, I can't be engaged to you if I'm still married to him. Well, if it'll make you feel better, we'll call Honolulu and get a check on him. No. No, I'm going to Honolulu. Well, I think this is getting... I'm sorry, Frank. But right now I can't help what you think. It's ridiculous. - What is? - The whole affair. You've been living in the past. You're ruining your life, destroying your future, And the future and the present of anybody and everybody around you. I've never heard you talk like this before. It's about time I did. I'll get the tickets. I'll be ready to leave any time you say. No, Frank. It's better I go alone. The Honolulu police station. - Police station? - Please. Want to turn yourself in, dear? - I beg your pardon? - I beg yours. Always opening my big mouth. Didn't you just come in on the plane? Yes, I did. - You live in the Islands? - No. No, it's my first visit. Oh ho ho. A Malahihi. - You had me fooled. - A Mala who? - That's a newcomer. - Oh. How long have you been in the Islands? Thirty-five years. The name's O'Reilly. Uh, Lida O'Reilly. I was a school teacher from Wisconsin. I saved up my money and came here for a two-week vacation. Forgot to go back. And now that I've told you my life story, uh, - maybe I could ask you a question? - Go ahead. Why is it that a nice looking young woman like you Is making her first stop in the Islands at the Honolulu Police Station? I have an appointment to see Chief Dan. And if you send me, chief... - Yes? A Miss Williams who called you from the mainland is here, The one who said she was a relative of Chet Chester. Oh, yes. Send her in. That'll be all, Ippy. Oh, me come back tomorrow, chief. Maybe have some hot information. Thank you very much, chief. Please, come in. - Welcome to Hawaii. - Thank you. Please sit down. Uh... our brief telephone conversation last night has me puzzled. I was under the impression you said it was in connection with a man named Chet Chester. Yes, it is. I presume you know Mr. Chester is in jail, being held for murder. Yes, I heard. May I ask, Mrs. Williams, uh, What your interest is in him? Well, I'll be brief. Just before the war, there was a young sailor, His name was Randy Williams. He was attached to the battleship Arizona. This was in 1941. On December the seventh, he was reported killed in action. I fail to see the connection with Chet Chester. I have reason to believe that Chet Chester and Randy Williams are the same. Bring in the file on Chet Chester. Mrs. Williams, what was your relationship to this uh... Randy Williams? He was my husband, and the father of my little boy. I wasn't aware that uh... Thank you, Sergeant. Look at this. Was it a wild goose chase? It's... I think it is Randy. But that mark on his face... Didn't he have a scar like that? No. No scar at all. But, I think it's him. Assuming that Chet is the man in question, I suppose you'd like to see him. Yes, I would. You can't see him today, I'm afraid. But I'll have him brought here at noon tomorrow. Can you be here then? Yes, I'll be here. Thank you. Now, I've got it all figured out. You're one of those lady journalists And you're here to do a big feature story on Hawaii. - Wrong again. - All right. Then why are you here on Hawaii? I came to see someone I... I think I know. Have you ever heard of a man named Chet Chester? Chester? Oh, sure. Sure. He killed some no good hoodlum. He's in prison. Are you going there to visit him? Yes, tomorrow with Chief Dan. Do you know anything else about him? Yeah, but they're just rumors. One rumor is that he uh, made a pile of dough during the war years, And then sort of retired. And now he owns the Hawaiian Retreat and has a nice home on Waikiki Beach. My information was correct, wasn't it? You have reservations on tonight's plane. - Yes, I'm going to the mainland. - Why? To help Chet get out of prison. Off the mainland? I'm sorry, Roger, I can't tell you anymore. Maybe you can tell me who that woman is that arrived in Honolulu. - What woman? - Quit pretending, Sally. You know who I am talking about. That Williams dame. Sorry, Roger. But I don't know who you mean. Sally, I warn you... don't lie to me. I... I get it now. You're taking his money out, aren't you? You're hauling it out of the Islands for him. Every cent he's got. All his loot. - Loot? - Yeah, loot. The dough that I helped him make. The stuff the syndicate took in. He sent for her, didn't he? He's turning it over to the two of you. You're wrong, Roger. He turned everything over to me. Thanks. Now I know. You're in a position to lay your hands on all his money. That's right. Where is it? He's not going to cut me out this time. Out of what? He paid you off a long time ago, the same as Novak. And what's left? A fortune. He's enjoying it alone. Using it to make himself important and good. Good... how? By giving a few lousy dollars to a bunch of slobs. Why do they need his help? You're hateful when you talk like this. Those poor people need everything they... They need nothing. They're used to the gutter. - Let them stay in it. - You're one of them. Most of them are our people. I take it back. You aren't one of them. You're not good enough. Who is it that you wish to see? Oh. Miss Sally Lee. - Do you work here? - Why, yes. I work here. Is Miss Lee in? Oh, she's not expected 'til much later. What is it you wish to see her about? It's business, a private matter. Perhaps I can wait inside. I wouldn't mind waiting. No. That is... uh... It'll be much too long to wait. Nobody home? No! Nobody home! Oh, you have someone waiting? Yes, that's right. Good bye. Did you see that man? He seemed rather odd. Oh, a lot of creeps on the island just like anywhere else. - You'll get used to it. - I suppose so. Have you got any plans tomorrow, Other than your noon time appointment with Chief Dan? - No. - Oh, good. Then while you're on the island, I'll be your guide, Or your chaperone, if you like. I like. Make plans. * Stars are falling from the skies * * They're falling for my Lani * * Falling stars are in her eyes * * For they adore my Lani * Although she makes me cry and cry * Although her lips may scold me * * I know she'll love me by and by * * For Lani's eyes have told me * Calm down. Calm down. You make me feel like a mother, helping her one and only to be a bride. What's the matter, Mrs. O? Haven't you ever been a mother? Me? No. And for a very good reason. I've never been married or... or anything. I wonder if he'll know me? Maybe it isn't even him. Well, if it is, I wonder how it'll seem? Didn't Chief Dan tell you to be at his office by noon? - Yes. - Then we'd better get a move on. I wonder how it'll seem, seeing him again... Talking to him. Fill it up. Come on, Jamie, break down. Why the nice little automobile ride? Where are we going? Up to Chief Dan's office. Oh, is he going to make an honorary police captain out of me For killing a hoodlum like Novak? You're pretty sure you're going to beat this rap, aren't you? - Sure, I'm sure. Car 568. Yes, sir. Yes, chief. Yes, sir. Right away. What's up? - We have to make a stop. - Where? Hey, what is this? What are we doing here? Sorry, Chet. You'll have to identify a body as next of kin. I have no kin. Well, you're the closest thing to it. Those are the regulations. - Four-oh-four? - Yeah, that's right. What's the matter, Jamie? Afraid I'll jump in one of those boxes? Go ahead. Who did it? We don't know, Chet. What do you mean, you don't know? - We're working on it. - You're working on it? You... Please, Mr. Chester, just make your identification. OK, I'll do it. - Name. - Sally Lee. - Age? - Late twenties. Relationship? Just... say a friend. That do it for you? Come on, Chet. I've got more important work to do. Sorry, Jamie. I was saying, are there any instructions or... That won't be necessary now. A girl by the name of Sally Lee has been murdered. Chet Chester was taken to the morgue to identify her body. No! After he identified her, Chester broke away from his guard. He... he escaped? No. I... I wouldn't call it that. I think he intends to find Sally Lee's killer. Is there anything I can... Chief Dan, when was... when did it happen? Some time yesterday afternoon. I went to visit Sally Lee yesterday. At the house? The place on Waikiki Beach? - Yes. - Did you see her? No. The man... he said he worked there... He told me she wasn't home. Man? There were no servants there. What time of day was this? About two or three o'clock. Can you describe this man? Well, he... he was... um... - Was he Chinese? - Well, Oriental. It's difficult for me to... What you're trying to say is to you, all Orientals look alike. Well, I could even be wrong about that. He might be a... mixture of nationalities. But, I don't think so. I know this. If I saw him again, I'd know him. Good. Then for your sake, I suggest you, uh, stay around your hotel. If he's the murderer, he knows you're the one witness who can identify him. As for Chet, I'll keep you posted. Thanks. So, you didn't see him at all? No, I didn't. Back to the hotel? Where would a man wanted by the police hide out? I imagine he'd head for Hell's Half Acre. Why? Who are you looking for this time? The same. Chet Chester. He's out of jail. He escaped. Uh-hmm. What was that place you said? Hell's Half Acre? What is that? Oh, it's a shabby tenement district that Honolulu's not very proud of. Wouldn't the police guess he's there and go in after him? Oh, they might, but they wouldn't get him. There are three hundred ways into Hell's Half Acre And four hundred ways out that they know of. Are there any young women in there? Yes. Taxi dancers, cheap, painted, disillusioned little ladies. Some of them live there and work in the nearby dance halls. Maybe if the people down there thought I was a taxi dancer, I could ask questions. And maybe word would get to Chet Chester that I wanted to see him. Get me a job down there. Honey, you're crazy. If you knew what it was like, you wouldn't even ask me. You should see the creeps that crawl around those dance halls. And they don't go there just to dance. But it might be my last chance to see him. If he gets off the island, I'll never find him. Don't you see, I've got to do it. Help me, please. Is this Hell's Half Acre? Yeah. It's all in behind these stores. You even walk like a lady. Give it a little more swing and sway, like this. Yep. That is better. Well, this is it. All right, honey? Change your mind? Want to get out of here? No. No, I'll stay. - Hey, George? - Yeah? Uh, this is Donna. Friend of mine. She's new here. She needs a job. Why? Why do you think, you ignorant knucklehead? Because she's broke. What do you expect, a character reference? All right, sister. It's four bits a dance. We'll split it with you. Turn in your tickets at the end of the night. And oh uh... whatever you make on the side... Tips that is, is all yours. OK honey, better join the ladies in waiting. And remember... What's the matter? They just fish you out of the deep freeze or something? Hey, I'm talking to you! Well, the fifty cents is for the dance. If you want snappy dialogue, it'll cost you extra. Ho ho. That's good. Psst! Tubby? Tubby! I told you stay in hotel and watch her. Why you think I buy you suit and everything? Her go from hotel. I saw. I now know where she go. - Very interesting place. - Where? Uh, such information has great value, no? - Paradise Ballroom. - She's here in the Acre? She taxi dance girl now. Are you sure she relative of Chester? Positive. She tell Chief Dan. I heard. That means Chester is here. No wonder he broke loose. She come here to meet him. Ippy, you want to make big pay? I mean big, big pay? Ippy always happy with money. Find Chet Chester. The order is still that you're to find Chet Chester tonight. Shall we start with Hell's Half Acre? You'd better. And make it a thorough raid. Bust it wide open if you have to, inch by inch, but find him! Let's go, men. Do you know a man by the name of Chet Chester? Sure. He's big man in Islands. I've heard of him. Lately? I read the paper like anybody else. Don't you? I'd like to meet up with him. Huh! So do the police. But no talk now, just dance. Oh, Mr. Kong, what are you doing down in this neighborhood? Slumming. Well, if you care to dance we have a new girl tonight. Yes, I know. Looking for Chet? You are, aren't you? Yes, I am. Do you know him? He's a good friend of mine. What were you doing in Miss Lee's house? Same thing you were. Looking for her. I had a message for her from Chet. You told me you were working there. Delivering a personal message is work. You know, I should call the police. Go ahead. But they can't lead you to Chet. I can. - Does he know I'm here? - Yeah. And he wants you to take me to him? Well, sure. That's right. You're related to him. You are, aren't you? What's all the running and the noise? That's the grapevine. There's a raid on. They're warning everybody. Come on in here. It's me. Ippy. Me know you're there, Mr. Chester. Police coming. Me help you. You know everything, don't you, Ippy? - You see, I a friend of you. - How did you know where I was? Oh, big secret. Ippy know all. Works for anybody that'll pay him. I wish to discuss that part with you. Pay? I am businessman. If I don't tell you police coming, they take you. Ippy gets nothing. But there is someone who will give big pay if I tell where you are. - Who? - Tubby Otis. One hundred dollars if I find you, but for two hundred, me no find you. You better collect the hundred and I'll be waiting for him. Maybe he'll tell me who he's working for. You no pay? Not for anything you've told me so far. - Any sign of Chester up there? - No, sarge. Ippy have other information. Relative of Mr. Chester in Honolulu. - I have no relatives. - She stay big hotel. Come to Half Acre. Taxi dance. Look for you. I told you I have no relations. She say she is. She at dance hall... Donna Williams. Williams? I show. You see her soon as policeman go away. She gone! Dance hall closed! - Ippy, you're a liar. - No, I no lie. Well, if you're not, find her and let me know where she is. Then you'll get your two hundred dollars. She relative? Look, I've got no relatives. Say it again and I'll wring that withered neck of yours. Poor Mr. Chester. No relatives. Fatso! Hey, Tubby. Wake up! You were in pretty bad shape last night. Go on! You've slept long enough! Where is he? The man who... I was drugged! There wasn't any man. Tubby here found you outside the Paradise Ballroom and he brought you here. It's a good thing he did. Anything could have happened to you. Anything? Is this... your place? If you mean am I married to that, yeah. - Go wash your face! - Yeah. You know it's already past noon? You really got loaded last night, girl. Well, how could I drinking coffee? Please, give me my clothes now. Sure. Here you are. - Where is she? - Bedroom. Did you find Chester yet? I didn't see Ippy anymore last night. Ippy. Stay away from that guy. I never did trust him. Use your other men. We must find Chester before the cops do. Hi. Don't leave her alone in there. Don't worry. The window's locked. Besides she's getting dressed. She isn't about to go anyplace. - Where's Fatso? - A little errand. - Your idea? - Yeah. Beautiful girl. - When are we going to cut out? - Soon. You keep saying that, but... She might be the answer... Unless she's a liar. She is a liar. Chet has no relatives. You know that. I don't know that and neither do you. Now be nice! Now why don't you be nice? Then I won't hurt you. I won't hurt you at all. And the police department just announced That Chet Chester is still at large. Last night's raid on Hell's Half Acre netted nothing. They suspect that he is... That's a nice girl. That's it. You know something? You're pretty. Yeah, very pretty. Now... now you can't scream any more. Can't even talk. I like you. You even breathe pretty. Here. Drink this. It'll help. How'd you get in that guy's room anyway? I wish I knew. I was drugged... or... Randy? Picture coming in clear now? Very clear. It's all right. I brought you here. Oh, I see. - Well? - Well, what? Aren't you going to say... something? Yes. I'm not... whoever you said. My name is Chet Chester. Ashamed? - Ashamed of what? - Your past. - What's wrong with it? - You tell me. You wouldn't be interested. - Uh, cream and sugar? - Sugar. No, you got the wrong boy. Take my word for it. Why should I? I guess you got no other choice. And I imagined it quite differently. - What? - Our meeting. The way it would be after all this time. What'd you expect I'd do? Run into your arms and tell you I'm the guy you're looking for? Yes. I'm sorry to disappoint you, girl. I'm not it. Then why did you bring me here?' 'Cause I can't stand to hear a woman scream. Thank you very much. Well, I'm all right now. I'd better be going. - Yeah, but... - What? Well, it's not safe. It's a pretty tough neighborhood. I sent for a friend of mine to take you home. That's very thoughtful of you. It'll be a few minutes before he gets here, so you might as well relax. Look, when you get out of here, Take my advice and grab the first plane back to wherever you come from, Back to that castle of dreams of yours. Don't mess around other people's dirty laundry. Tell me about this, uh, Randy? He must've been quite a character To send you half way across the world looking for him. Who is he? My husband of three days. That wouldn't be too hard to take. Why don't you sit down? Where'd he come from? - A small town in Arizona. - Yeah? Nice family. Randy had a kid sister, too. Only she's not a kid anymore. She was married a few weeks ago. Good for her. Now, shall we change the subject? Or is there something else? Yes, there is. A son, my son. He's eleven years old. That would... That would... Make him the father of the child. How did you know how long ago I was married to Randy? I didn't. The way you talk it sounded like it was quite a while ago. Yes, before the war. And he was the father. Only he never saw the boy... never knew. I christened him Randy. He looks just like... him. Does that mean anything to you? No. Why should it? He's in a military school. He's very bright and quite manly. Anybody would be proud of him. And he's... he's crazy about sports. He made the baseball team. I saw him play the other day. He got himself a homerun... with the bases loaded. Yeah? Me got it for you. Did you open it? Oh, no. Ippy not open. Ippy not see key inside. You wouldn't know what the key was for anyway. No. Me ponder, but me not know. I bring number one man. He waiting for you. Come on. You're going home. Mr. Chester not poor now, has relative. - Chief Dan! - Hello, Dan. Good evening. I can't believe it. We've raided this place, combed it from one end to the other, And you were here all the time. You have to come with me. I know, Dan. But do me a favor first? That's why I sent for you. What is it? Get Mrs. Williams back to her hotel and onto a plane to the mainland. Before whoever killed Sally comes back after her. Jamison can attend to that. My job is to take you in. Look, Dan, I didn't escape for my freedom. - I wanted to get the... - I know that. But now you're going to have to leave that up to us. Give me a chance... just a couple of hours While you're getting Mrs. Williams squared away. I think I can do it. Everybody in the Acre's helping me. If my lead is right, why they'll find him and bring him to me. Look, Dan, put me in that room with Jamie, or a squad of cops. I'll be under wraps, handcuffed. When the killer comes in, Jamie can grab him. OK, two hours. Thanks. Let's hope we can get this job finished tonight. Too bad your job can't be finished. Can't it? Here in Hawaii, memories of times gone by are two for a quarter. Come on, Jamie. - No funny stuff this time. - All right. I'll be good. The most important thing to the man at the dance hall Was to discover what your relationship is to Chet, isn't it? Yes. Uh-huh. Then, if he were to believe that you are Chet's wife, Chet wouldn't even have to look for him. He'd come voluntarily. We could trap him. What are you driving at? Oh, nothing. I was just making like a cop. It gets to be a habit. What are you doing? I knew you weren't going to leave me, Ja... What are you doing back here? You changed your clothes. Why didn't Dan put you on the plane? Because my place is with you. I'm your wife. Make believe wife, that is. Look, this is no time to play house. Where is Dan? What's this all about? I'm going to be part of your plan to catch the man that killed Sally Lee. Chief Dan says that if the murderer thinks I'm your wife, He's more certain to come after me than he is after you. - You see, I saw him. - What? Yes. About the time Sally Lee was killed. Where? At your house, on the beach. Who was he? What does he look like? - He was an oriental. - Chinese? I think so. I can't be certain. What can you be certain of? Are you sure you'd recognize him if you saw him again? Yes. I would. How did you get mixed up in this? Tangled up with murder, With people you've never even heard of. And now the police are using you in a stakeout... A target for somebody's shooting practice. Who's going to protect you? The whole area will be filled with detectives. Oh, they won't even get past the grapevine. Look. Some already have. And there are more to come. They came in plain clothes. Take a look. Did Dan talk you into this? It was his idea, but I talked him into it. How's anybody going to get this idiotic story of yours, About your being my so-called wife? What are we supposed to do, Stand on a rooftop and shout it to the world? It's going to be on the 9:00 news broadcast And that, uh, that Mr. Ippy is going to sell the information to Tubby Otis. Chief Dan arranged that, too. Why are you doing this? It's crazy. I thought I'd help as long as I'm here. Look, I don't want your help. I don't want it. I don't need it. I'm not buying it. This time you have no choice. - I don't? - No! Because I've decided to stick around a little longer. I don't believe you... that story about Chet Chester. You're going to have to be a little more convincing. It's 24 minutes before 9:00. That gives you 24 minutes. To do what? To tell you the life story of Chester? All right, if that's what you want. Let me see now. It was a bed of roses all the way. What? You want more? Yes. When did you come to the Islands? When? When I was a little boy in knee pants, And I've lived here ever since like a happy, little beachboy. I told you, Roger! That's enough, Roger! That's enough! Dirty stupid slob! Well, now that we're on a story telling jag, what about your story? What's the difference? - Are you ashamed? - No! Well, come on. Let's hear it. The life and loves of Donna Williams. - Loves? - Yeah, make it good. There's nothing I like better than a good, corny love story. Did you ever hear the one about the little girl... Seventeen? Silly, wide-eyed, met a sailor boy just before the war. Fell crazy in love with him. He and the girl went everywhere together, The beach, the show, riding the rollercoaster, dancing. The world was young and so were they. Nothing was ever going to hurt them. Nothing. Corny enough for you? Oh, you're doing fine. Oh, wait until you hear the rest. They ran off to Tijuana and got married. They had a mad, lovely honeymoon. He bought her a sombrero, And a little painted turtle, named Ichabod. Then, oh get this wild finish, Just when they celebrated their third anniversary, The third day that is, He went away. - A real rat. - No. He had to go. His ship was sailing. The next the girl heard about was Pearl Harbor. He was missing in action. She couldn't believe it... For a long, long time. She had a wild idea in her head that somehow he'd escaped, And maybe he couldn't come back because... Because he was burned out of his mind. Is that what you mean? What about the climax scene? What about the boy? Who believes his father died a hero. Yeah. When you tell the story, don't leave that out. That's the best part. It's not a very happy story, is it? All right, Ippy. Go ahead. - It's Ippy. Ippy. - Invite him in. - He can't see you here. Shut up. I'll handle it. Mr. Kong! What are you... Do you want to broadcast my name all over the Acre? What you doing here, Mr. Kong? Who told you to come here? Have news. Good news. Who are you working for? Tubby. And you. Ippy big friend of you. What's the news? Well, ordinarily it cost lot of money, but not to you. - It's free. - Free information? Chet Chester has Donna Williams with him. Where? They in court four balcony, room 47. - She his wife. - Is this a police trap? Are you working for the cops? They sent you here, didn't they? No. Ippy good friend of you. Nobody send. Me saw. Girl wife of him. Me telling truth. Ippy go now, please! You're not going anywhere. You puny, double-crossing little creep! Me telling truth. Me go! Please! Mrs. Chet Chester who flew in From the mainland has disappeared from her hotel. It is reliably reported that she has made contact With her fugitive husband, who yesterday escaped the police. Mrs. Chester is believed to be in hiding with Chet Chester this very moment. However... He was telling the truth. Maybe for the first time, and he died for it. Shut up! So she is his wife. What about it? What's the difference now? The difference is she's right here in the Acre. She's made herself a fugitive just like him. She's right here within reach. - Well, what do you want to do? - It's your fault! What are you trying to do? You've got two murders on your hands already. Do you want to make it three? A million dollars. It's all gone now. But it's a lot worse. Now it's my neck. We must get her. She and Chet both, before the cops do. Why doesn't Ippy come out? - There may be another door. - Well, let's... Let's go and break in right now. No, no. Wait. Still can't see a thing. Use the back door just the same. If this works, he... Or they ought to be along any minute. - What time is it? - 9:07. I hope the police are ready. Sorry you got into this now, aren't you? It was a trap! Dirty rat! Thanks anyway for giving the stake out a trial, Dan. All we caught was Tubby Otis. What about his wife? She got away along with somebody who was with her. And Ippy's in the emergency hospital, half-dead, broken neck. Where's Mrs. Williams? There are no planes leaving for the Mainland until the morning. She needed protection for the night, So I thought it best that she stay at your beach house. Alone? So, I... I practically blew my cork worrying about you. I didn't know whether to get ready for a funeral or wedding. A lot of good I did him. He's on his way back to prison. Is it the end of the line for him? I guess so. You feel pretty bad, don't you? - Rotten. - Because of her? Yeah. - She must be in love with you. - Oh, that's crazy. She's got some silly romantic idea that I'm somebody else. Chet, it should be obvious even to a blind man that Donna's not just going away and forget you, Whatever your name is. Then someone has to make her do it. Calling car one. This is car one. Come in. Chief, Ippy died at the hospital. Oh. Then you weren't able to get him to talk. No. Only a couple of mumbled words. It was all garbled up. Sounded something like Konrog... Rog... Something like that. Thank you. Kong... Rog... Are you trying to say Roger Kong? Turn left at the next street! Chet, quit kidding with me. Now, do what I tell you. Take the next left. You're being very foolish. Just how far do you think you'll get? By the time you get to a telephone, I'll be as far as I want to go. - Now stop the car. - No, Chet! Yes, chief? Get me the Hawaiian Retreat. Yes, sir. Hawaiian Retreat. Go ahead, chief. Is Roger Kong there? Yes, sir. Mr. Kong has been here quite some time, Since 7:30. Thank you. A call just came in, either from the chief or someone in his office. Did you tell him that we had been here ever since 7:30? - Sure I did. - That's good. - What was that? - It worked. At least we have an alibi just in case somebody Thought they recognized us running out of the Acre. - I thought you were... - Behind bars? What are you writing? Your memoirs? - No. Just a letter. - Fine. I've been writing too, a new finish to that story of yours. You see, the little girl comes to the Islands. She thinks her sailor boy is still alive. She even thinks she sees him. She's wrong. All wrong. Her sailor boy is dead. Nothing... and no one will bring him back. Now let the dead rest! Stop walking on a grave. Fine writing. And while you're at it, why not finish the letter for me? It's to our son. You didn't fool me. Maybe for a few minutes in the beginning. But that's all. What do you want me to do? Tell him the truth? Tell him his father didn't die a hero? Wasn't a hero at all? A deserter, a thief, a cheat? A man who will probably rot out the rest of his life in prison. Is that what you want me to tell him? No, his father's dead. He died the day Chet Chester started to live, And Chet Chester will stay here in the Islands. In the paradise he found? The paradise he stole. Now the story's really finished. Close the book and put it away. Never was a very good book anyway. It wasn't even worth your plane fare. I still wish there was... some solution, some way. Donna, what ever happened to that turtle? That Ichabod? I let him swim in the fishpond one day. He disappeared. I think he hid under one of the water lilies. There were so many lilies, I couldn't find him. Then you come out from under yours. Randy, I think you're under the impression I've been living in an ivory tower all these years. I haven't. - Is he good to you? - Very. Then you get back there and marry him. It'll be your first marriage. You know, three days doesn't make a marriage. - Our boy does. - Then give him a break. Give him a father he can be proud of. Give him a man in the house that he can look up to and respect. Don't smother him with memories of a man that doesn't exist. It's too late to count our regrets. Wait. I'd like to kiss you goodbye. You were wrong. It was worth the plane fare. - Get the waiter. - I told you you've had enough. No, one more. Just one more. I'm celebrating. - A fish wife no more. - Quiet down. Oh, my poor slob of a husband. Bang, bang, bang. I'll bet he has more holes in him than a sieve. Knock it off. Dead! With a million bullet holes in him. Hello, Harry. Chet! What are you doing here? Somebody will see you! - The police just called. - No, that was me. I was just checking up to see if Roger had used the old perfect alibi routine. I was sure he would. - Come on and dance with me. - All right. No more drinking, or you won't be able to get out of that chair. - The place is emptying out. - It must be closing time. Why don't you go pay the check? I'll go powder my nose. Waiter? Hey, what is this? Hey, let me out of here! What's the idea? - Waiting for your check? - Yes, I am. Chet! What are you doing here? The police will spot you! I've got to get going. Running out on an old friend? And I always thought you were one of my best friends. Sure, I am. You and Sally and I... Went a lot of places over the years. - Didn't we, Roger? - Yeah. Yeah, a lot of places. But... so what? You always said if there was any favor I wanted, you'd do it. Sure. Go ahead. Name it. What is it you want? Tell me about those people who were killed tonight in Hell's Half Acre. What makes you think I know anything about it? I haven't been anywhere near the Acre. I've been right here ever since... Ever since seven thirty. I know. Yeah. That's right. And I can prove it. You forget. I invented the alibi. So that makes you the only one who knows about it. Now sit down and be a good boy. Harry, bring that pen I asked you for. I have something here in the nature of a legal document. It only needs my signature for a punch line. What is it? What are you talking about? To Randy Williams, Junior, I leave all my real and personal property. You make it sound like your last will and testament. Ah, you're a real smart boy, Roger. That's exactly that it is. The documents and cash to be found In my vault at the First National Bank of Honolulu. That's what you wanted to know, isn't it, Roger? I don't know what you're talking about. Sally had to die because she wouldn't tell you where it was. You're crazy! I never... You killed her! You wanted to see me rot in jail Just so you could get your hands on my money. Here, I'll help you. This is the key to my vault... The key you didn't even need because it's the same vault we had when we were partners. And you still have authorization to go into it at any time. So you see? The money wasn't hidden after all. Yet you killed. Three people had to die While you were trying to find it. Sally stumbled and fell. It was an accident. What about Ippy's broken neck? Was that an accident? I've got an errand for you. The favor I wanted you to do as an old friend. Deliver that to Donna Williams at my house. Don't forget your gun, Roger. You forget I still have the authorization at the bank. That'll be stopped in the morning. You won't stop anything. You won't tell anybody about Sally or the key or anything else. In front of witnesses? Well? You won't get far. - He got away? - Not quite. He's waiting for me outside. Five-one-nine-one-one. Hello, Dan? I'm glad you're back. I'm sorry, Dan. I had to. Now wait a minute. Now listen, Dan. Listen, this is important. Have some of your men move into the area, Surrounding the Retreat right away. The Hawaiian Retreat. Make sure they're unnoticed. Now when they hear a shot, and they nail the guy Who fired it, they'll have the murderer of Sally and Ippy. And Dan, just in case you have trouble proving he murdered Sally and Ippy, You may be able to charge him with another murder. Whose? Mine. Chet, don't be a fool! Chet! Chet! Harry, fix me a nightcap, will you? - The usual? - Yeah. I always said you mixed the best drinks in the Islands, Harry. What was that? - Chief! - Good afternoon. I see you're ready to leave. I understand you have everything arranged. Yes, I have. Well, I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd stop by for a farewell aloha. That's very kind of you. Your call is ready from the mainland. Excuse me. - Oh, Mrs. Williams? - Yes? Eh, by any chance are you going to speak to your uh... little boy? - Yes, I am. - Well, good. Then why don't you tell him that the original Navy records were correct? His father... his father died at Pearl Harbor. Thank you, chief. Thank you very much. Hello, Frank? Is little Randy with you? Good. Hello, sweetheart. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, darling. Mommy's coming home.
