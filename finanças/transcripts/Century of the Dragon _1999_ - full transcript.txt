My name is Wong Chi-sing. I am 24 years old. Three years ago. I was a cadet of the Royal HK Police Force. At that time. I planned to be an inspector. I wanted to live a stable life. Just like the recruiting advertisement. Save kids. arrest thieves... That was what I had in mind... God knows... After saying ''Yes Sir''. My life was totally changed. I entered an evil world which I could never dream of. Wong Chi-sing. Sir. You. the most outstanding student before the unification with China. Are you willing to accept a most difficult assignment? I want you to leave the school before graduation. We've arranged you to join the most powerful triad society... Hung Hing Society. I want you to be the fellow of Fai-lone. The most outstanding branch leader of Hung Hing. Do you understand? Fai-lone? After being the undercover. You only have to report to me. You can't disclose your identity to anyone. About your salary. We'll automatically transfer it to your account. Do you understand? Sir. I want to know what I have to do. Anything to nail Fai-lone and Hung Hing. Yes sir! After entering the triad society. I discover that. the present triad society is totally different from what I thought. They are organized and the care benefits most. Sometimes. They pay no respect to their boss because of benefits. They always want to be respected. But most important of all. for money. they can lose face. Pao. the head of Hung Hing. will carry out a mission. I don't know what they are fighting for. but I am sure of one thing. that's about money. They didn't offend me. they despise Hung Hing. Even Ken. that's me. and you agree that. Fai-lone will say no. - You have my total support. - Wait! Shut up. you bitchy Ken. If there is a fight. you must be the first one to run. What is it? Speak up. You know. I have to go now! Today is the birthday of Fai-lone's mom. she is my God-mother. Of course I have to attend the party. is that right? Why do you still stay? If you don't go now. you'll starve to death. I am going...but...Brother Pao. I know two fools will go there to gamble. I would like you to join me. give me ten thousand dollars. We'll be the banker. sure we can win money from the 2 fools. If you lose. do you have money to pay for it? I am a righteous person. It's okay... Forget the gambling. But you must send my god-mother lucky money. I'll do you a favor to bring it there. Do you want a lesson? Go now! Well. I am leaving. I am sorry. Brother Pao. I am sorry. Brother Sing... Sing. what a coincidence! You'd better go for the mahjong game. You are so nice! That's why you are the left hand of Fai-lone. Brother Sing. What a bastard! What's wrong did Fai-lone do in his previous life? How can he treat this bastard as his brother? He became a triad member when he was 15. He is now thirty something. He is lucky to be alive. His father was lucky. When Fai-lone's father was slashed. He covered for his dad. That's why Fai-lone pays for his family expenses. I think you are going to do it now? But the police are informed. you must be very careful. It's okay. I told everyone that we'd do it tomorrow. The police will believe in it. Tonight. we'll smash the turf of Loan Shark Ko. Do you want me to inform Fai-lone? No. he is a filial son. Don't bother him. I'll chat with him later. Fai-lone will ask me. If he doesn't see you in the party. It's okay. I'll ask my son to go. Chun. What is it. Dad? Greet Brother Sing. - Brother Sing. - Come on. take a seat. ls he your son? He failed to study in the UK. So I asked him to come back and work for me. Don't scare the shit out of him! He looks like a gentleman. You are cheated! He killed a darkie in UK and fled back. Do you need my help? No. thanks... You'd better serve the guests. Big Head Man hasn't come yet. Our members are all fighters. Fai-lone is the only smart businessman among us. Leave him alone! Take care of my son. Okay? Sure. wish you good luck. Why not go with us? No. I have to do something first. Forget it. why not ask someone to help you? No. thanks. Are you tailed? No. Do you have any move tonight? Five years! I've waited for five years. Officer Cole will lead a team to arrest Pao. Pao has never imagined that... He did so many bad deeds. But he could escape from the charges. But this time. he will be caught because of the pirates VCDs. Pao is smart. This time. he gets furious and becomes careless. After he is caught. you can join the force again. right? Police? I've been an undercover for years. I think I am a triad member. I have to betray my own boss. This is not my wish. Make sure one thing. we are not triad members. We are police. Is it the birthday of Fai-lone's mom? I can't imagine that... Everyone knows Fai-lone's gone straight. Why are you put next to him for three years? I don't know. I don't want to know it too. When you are in the troubled water. you can't care so much. He treats you like his blood brother. Will you have difficulty to nail him? Maybe I can't wait for that day. I may be killed before that. I have to go now. - Brother Fai-lone. - Yes! You must win the seat in the Rural Council. You can't lose. Otherwise. we will have no face. It's time for Uncle Kuen to enjoy life. I don't mind spending effort and money. But. on the election day. most important is being fair. I don't want to bride for any tickets. Do remember the ICAC. Fai-lone. are you kidding me? Although you are rich. Why are you gutless? I only have my gall bladder removed. do you know that? I think I have to talk to Pao. Pao is my best buddy. He agrees with me. everything! Uncle Kuen. it's time to enjoy life. Cheers. Mom. one more kiss. - Happy birthday! - My dear son! Alan and May will come to wish you happy birthday. Did you force them to come? Don't frame me. I dare not do so. Be serious. okay? It's your mom's birthday. I always behave like this. Henry. take care of grandma. Otherwise. I will flush you away with the shit. All right. You are disgusting! Senator Chow. - Welcome... - Congratulation... Hope your mother have a happy birthday. Iive long and happy. Thanks...Daisy. - Daisy. - Senator Chow. How come you are so early today? Don't you have a meeting to attend to? It was too boring. So I sneaked out. Sorry!

Better sit down and talk this over. Let's not talk about this today. Today is my mom's birthday. Let's forget it with a drink. My friend is dealing over there. Go try your luck. Show them around. Go play a couple of hands. Help yourself! Let's bet... The way brother Fai-lone treated us is despising us. Brother Fai-lone is a gentleman now. He won't fight any more! Let's go play a hand. Mrs. Lone. May is looking for you at the reception. - Excuse me. - No problem! Mrs. Lone. come over here please. - What's the matter? - One of the red envelopes is like this. Paper money?

Sam. don't cause trouble. Look after this place for me. Yes. Mrs. Lone. - Sam. - Mrs. Lone. Sing. how come you are so late? Brother Pao has something planned for tonight. Don't tell brother Fai-lone. Brother Sing. Can you introduce brother Fai-lone to me? - You haven't met him yet? - I knew him. But I was 9 years old at that time and I played with him oftenly. I am 20 something now. Come. Let me introduce to you. When you meet my mom later. you have to tell her she is pretty. Relax! We know what to say. Brother Fai-lone. a young man wants to meet you. Brother Fai-lone. Who are you? Chun. Chun? Brother Pao's son. Are you kidding?! You are the one who studied in England. I just came back. Come here... You are so tall!

Should we go teach him a lesson? How many times have I told you? We're something! They are shit. Never mix up with them. Forget it. tell someone to clear the place up. What's the matter. come have a drink. Have you called Big Head Man? Yes. but he hasn't called back. Let's not wait for him. Let's go. - Boss... - Brother Pao. You. go around to the back. Brother Pao. How come you are so late? I over slept. Brother Pao. Let me handle this small matter. Cut the crap! Let's go! No. you go to the party. I've never missed any fight! Let's go.

I've just had my gall bladder cut. I can't drink much. Come on...drink it. old woman. What did you say? No. I can do it. Good! Mrs. Lone is wonderful. That's why you were the number one club girl in town. What did you say? Sorry! I am drunk. Come. I will drink this. Forget it! Sorry. he is drunk. Okay. enjoy yourself...Let's go. Sorry everyone. I just remembered that I have something to do. I have to go now. Thanks! Thanks for coming. - It's okay! - Help them out. I will walk you out. Thanks! Where is Big Head Man? He's been arrested? I will come with brother Fai-long soon. It's going to be a while before this party ends. You have things to do in the morning. Go home early. okay? I haven't said bye to all the guests yet. It's okay. I can handle it. - Sam! - Yes! - Take my mom and Henry home. - Okay! - Go back. - Let's go! God-mother. Ken. if you need money. I will give it to you. sit. They took Big Head Man. The rest of them are in the hospital. What? Brother Fai-lone. Something happened to your dad. he is in the hospital. I said your dad is in the hospital. How come you don't seem to care! Brother Lone is the boss here. Your decision is always right. There is nothing I can do but listen to you. Okay. Sing. send the guests to the door now. - Thanks for coming... - Thanks. - Bye! - Thanks for coming... Where is the chicken and fish? How come you are serving dessert? If you have no money you shouldn't treat us to dinner. Sorry. brother Fai-lone. I hate it when I am drunk. I always say something stupid. Did he have a run in with brother Pao? It's all a misunderstanding. What did brother Pao say? I...I don't know. I am Pao's buddy. I will listen to him. Are you finished? - Boss... - What? Are you trying to help an outsider? Let him down. you will kill him. Stop! Let him down. - Sing. - Yes! Get the car. The thing I have been worried for so long finally happened. When I retired. I told him to go straight. But now. only brother Pao is qualified for this position. But it dragged Pao down. In triad society. more powerful you are. more people want to kill you. There is no happy ending! I have been retired for 5 years. But I always got harassed by them. Once you are a gangster. Forever you are a gangster inside the troubled water. Shut up! - Brother Sing. - They won't let us see brother Pao. We want to see brother Pao. Shut up! Be quiet! What? What are you guys doing here? He is wanted suspect. He is in custody. No matter how serious he is injured. He can only see his lawyer. understand? You must be Mr. Cole?! Sorry. I want to ask you to give me a favor. Mr. Lone. I don't know if you are the business man Mr. Lone. Or the brother Fai-lone from the Hung Hing? I am Mr. Lone. Pao is my friend. this is his son. How is my dad doing? Let me tell you. he hurt his spine. Stop! Relax. he is not dead yet. Can I go see him? Mr. Cole. do me a favor. please! If you let his son go see him. I promise you that all these people will disappear. Let me tell you. I am not dealing with you. - Are you his son? - Yes! Go inside. Thanks! Sing. take them away. How is my dad? Although he is not at critical situation. He may not move in future. You mean...vegetable? I hope it'll be better. What? Dad wants you to take care of me from now on... It will be fine. Have fun. boss. - Eva. - Sing. Judy is with other customers right now. I will wait for her. And. brother Man. you brought him here once. Has been here since 3 o'clock. And been drinking inside the room. He is drunk. Get up! Don't mind me. Let me get some peace and silence. okay? What are you doing?! I don't know what the hell I am doing here! Am I a man or a ghost? I am a cop. a cop's job is to catch thieves. But now brother Pao is shot. I don't feel well. Do you think I am sick? You are not sick. I am getting sick. Do you know that when brother Pao was shot? He only worried about me and told me to run. He really treated me as his brother! Wake up. okay? The truth is. Pao was shot. Stop being like this. okay? Tell me. am I a cop? Tell me... Sing. How is Man? He is sick! He is sick?! He doesn't look like it. He is drunk. You lied. he doesn't look like it. Are you looking for me or for him? The man next door is nasty! Go kick his ass for me. I told you to quit! Are you going to take care of me? You think I can't? It's not that simple as you think. I want to go shopping at Joyce Boutique. I want to be like brother Fai-lone's wife. She is my idol. Do you know that? They've gone through so much! You are nastier than the guy next door! Go back! No! Are you in a hurry? I am hungry. Let's go back. okay? Okay! Let's go! And him. You sure?! l will help him. Food is here. So many food on the noodle? If you're thin. I'll have no face! If I become a fat boy. you will really get no face. I you don't want to get fat. don't eat it then. What? Will you take care of me? I told you I will. Will you marry me? Marry you?! I am worried that you will become a widow. Your are big mouth! - You are always talking nonsense! - Stop it. no. - Stop talking shit. - You are dirty! What did you say? Say it again. You are dirty. I know. you don't like me because I am a club girl. There are nice club girls too. Brother Fai-lone's wife is an example. I just worry about you. If I receive a phone call in the middle of the night. You will be worrying about me all night if I go out. If I want to be your wife. I have to be able to stand for it. Do you think it is as easy as you think? Okay! Since you are so sincere. I will let you be the queen of my right side. I dare you... To find a queen of the left side. I will try...I hope not. Stop it... Stop acting dead. I am not going to look! - You said it. - Watch it... You are hurting me. I will take off your clothes. Stop it! What? I will go wash the dishes. Forget it! None of your business. I don't care. because I know it. Remember. don't act like me. It is very expensive here. Expensive?! Do you know that. many movie stars come here to shop. It is not the same. they sleep with rich fools. Am I a fool too? My ass! I am a gangster. Stop hitting me on the street. okay? CID... - What is it? - What's going on? You have the rights to remain silent. But everything you say can be used against you in court. Come back with me. Go home and wait for me. Why take me here? I don't need to use the bathroom. Let's talk outside. Why should we talk in here? Mr. Cole. the suspect is here. But he is very tricky. PC 26117 Do you know that something happened to officer Wai? I read about it. I will take care of your file from now on. You will report to me. Man is about to return to the force. but you can't. You have to help me nail Fai-lone. You think you can nail him? Why not? Fai-lone is no longer a triad. He is no longer doing bad deeds. How can we nail him? Looks like you are helping him. I am not. I am only telling the truth. Why are you talking to me loudly? I speak loud. because I want to leave a mark inside of you. so you will think about it. By the way. Let me tell you. I am a cop too. Although I am your subordinate. Please don't lock me up next to a toilet. When you want to talk to me. Let me tell you. Once he is a gangster. forever he is a gangster. Tong Pao is lying in the hospital paralyzed. Lone is well-known and respected. They will make him the leader. Can we nail them for illegal crimes they're doing? You look like a triad more than a police. Get a little smarter. okay? If I look like a cop. I would be dead long time ago. And I am not deaf. You don't have to talk to me so loud. Remember to report to me everyday. If Fai-lone becomes the leader. I am going to nail him for sure. Inside Hung Hing. we have more undercovers than you think. If you do anything stupid. I will nail you too. Set me free! Sorry. I haven't been here for too long. I get lost. Sit! Where? Every members here all agreed that... There is only one man can become Pao's successor. That is you. Sorry! I appreciate so much for all your supports. But I am here today is only to understand... How everyone wants to deal with Pao's situation. If you guys need any help. tell me. Brother Fai-lone. are you kidding?! You won't help Hung Hing? Brother Fai-lone. you can do it. Everyone respects you. Uncle...I... What is it. Fai-lone? You don't respect our decision? - Mr. Ma. - Sorry. but. all the elders. I know I am young. And don't have the rights to talk. But about my father's matter. I hope everyone will give me some time. Go ahead. My dad got beaten so badly by the cops. He did it because it was his job. I can assure you that we have a traitor here. And he is sent here as an undercover by the police. And there are many of them. Do you have any evidence? He might be any one of us. But before I have got evidence. I won't say it. Chun. you want to take care of this yourself? No. brother Fai-lone. I just want to tell everyone that. my dad has done many deeds for Hung Hing for ages. All the elders took good care of him. But this time he sacrificed for Hung Hing. I think everybody should say something. do something. Help him to find out who the traitor is! I dare say one thing. Whoever finds out the traitor. Who has the rights to take this seat. Chun is right. we will do this then. Chun. if you need money to take care of your dad in the hospital. Remember to page me. I am leaving now. Brother Fai-lone. I know that you are rich. But money can't solve everything. Right! Money can't solve a lot of things. Uncle. The society is growing fast everyday. We can't run away from the law anymore. Don't under-estimate the power of the police. But... If you have never done bad deeds. you shouldn't be scared. If we don't do bad deeds. who'd feed us? You're silly! Better be a boy scout. Sorry! Mr. Ma. I am talking nonsense. This is it for today. Whoever finds the traitor. who gets this seat! If you need anything. come to me. Let's go. He is a business man now. You have to rely on yourself. Sing. check up on what Chun said. You mean the traitor? Right! After Pao got into trouble. Big Head Man disappeared. The rumor is saying that he is the traitor. I will go check it out. - Sam. go get the car. - Okay! If you quit now. I can't guarantee your safety. You should know about the situation right now. I know what to do. I will leave Hong Kong. It's up to you! Man. He went out. What? Who called? I don't know. nobody talked. Man Junior. Clear it up. Dad will take you to China to see white tiger. okay? I have to go to school tomorrow. Don't worry. I've called the school already. go pack your stuff. - It's him! - Kill him! Over there. Let's go... Don't mind me. Let's go! Hurry! Go to hell! Big Head Man. My dad treated you quite well in all these years. Why you treated him like this? I didn't! I dare you to swear in front of God Kwan! I didn't do anything. You didn't see it? I forgot to tell you to walk faster. Or you won't see your son again. It has nothing to do with my son... Kid. are you Big Head Man's son? Let my son go. Uncle. my dad got beaten. Really? I want you to suffer more than your dad does! Son! Don't be scared. your dad is here. Son. don't be scared! No! Sorry! I know I've hit you too hard. You know? I really love my father very much! Dad. you are something! You are really loyal! What good does it do? You and Fai-lone have been friends since you guys were little. You guys struggled together but he gets all the money. You even gave him the girl you love the most. If I were you... I would have taken back half of his property and his wife. The old people in Hung Hing are useless. Look at you. you are badly injured but no one comes to see you. I killed big Head Man for you already. He sold you out! I avenged for you. Fai-lone?! He is always stepping on your shoulder. I will be higher than he is. What do you want to eat? Orange. okay? I am feeding you. why don't you eat it? Eat! You are like this all your life. You never like anything I do. My teacher told me. ''Behind the hero. there are piles of bones.'' I'm the hero! Let me do it. I will become your successor. I will become your successor. you hear me? You hear me? I will become your successor! What's up. brother Fai-lone? How come you are here? Chun asked you to come. Brother Yiu told me to look after Chun. And he told you to leave your men to me. What the hell are you saying? I want to see Pao. Wait. Let me see your ID. Did you kill Man Junior? Which one of your eyes saw me killing him? I am as powerful as Fai-lone. How dare you talk to me like this? Quiet. don't argue right here. Fai-lone is here. act sad. Fai-lone. they don't know shit! Teach your followers! More... Mr. Ma. what do you want? Sing. walk aside. Shut up! This is the hospital. You can go in now. Thanks. wait for me here. Thanks! Brother Fai-lone. What? I told my dad. I was forced to kill Big head Man. We are sad too. Sorry! But I didn't hear this. Yes! Do you know how tough big head Man was? Couple of my men were injured. I told him to stop. But he took a digger and charged at me. I blocked the blow with one hand and attacked with my other hand. I don't know why...but he just fell. Who told you he was a traitor. who said it? It's dad! I asked him who is the traitor he has had in mind. He wrote two words. Relax! If you are alive... I will take care of your son. Dad. what's wrong? Dad is in pain again. dad! Look after him. I will go call the doctor. Doctor... Go check on him. hurry. Brother Fai-lone. - What's the matter? - Boss told me to find out the traitor. And he told Mr. Ma to help me. Check if you can spare brother Sing to help me. Can he help you? Of course. he is very close to Big Head Man. really? He knows where Big Head Man used to hang out. I might be able to find some leads with his help. Why don't I call brother Yiu. And let him talk to you about it? I will help him. This time my boss sends me to work for you. After the job we will have nothing to do with each other. How can you say that? This is my style. If you don't like it. I can't help. Tell you the truth. there are two purposes to this job. First is that. I want to seek revenge for my dad. You want to kill Loan Shank Ko?! Sing is smart! You always have a sound mind. I want to kill the cop who shot my dad. Excuse me! Who are those two men? Why don't you let me serve them? They are not good people. don't let them see you. Why do you drink with them then? There are good triads and bad triads. They are pointing their guns at Fai-lone. So I have to spy on them. Be careful! Don't act tough! What?! You worried about me?! You are so corny! Let's go! Sorry! Your girlfriend? No! I slept with her last week. She asked whether I want to do it again. She is nice! If you don't like her. I will take it. I think you can find a better girl. She's too passive. Watch your mouth! I envy you very much. brother Sing. Men and women they all like you. you are something. What is your plan? Loan Shark Ko's pirates VCD factories all are on short term leases. He let his men sell the VCDs. Even if their stores got shut down. they won't lose a lot. There are two other factories. Making porno and pirate VCDs. I want to report it to the Custom Dept. So Loan Shark Ko's factories will be forced to shut down. His skilled workers will be arrested. And he'll lose all his machines. This is real tough! You are smart. Mr. Ma will take care of this! Brother Fai-lone only needs to provide us money. But that cop. I think brother Sing should fix him for me. To kill a cop?! Thanks for the assignment. Are you afraid? Who is it? His name is Cole. He is always on the newspaper. Don't you read newspaper? Killing a police is a big crime. Let me think about it. I have confidence in you. brother Sing. You can do it. Cheers! Cheers! Okay. What? Haven't you eaten yet? Again. You quitted smoking for a long time. No. I just want to search back some old feeling. Why? I don't know. The triads right now look down upon me. The whole world... Only the cops treat me as a triad. I'm out! No. you are still great. You almost broke my jaw. Sometimes. I don't even know what I am doing. People talk about going straight. So I decided to go straight to make money. When I become successful. people said that I used my power to make money. If I fail. people would laugh at you. Okay. today. I can't go anywhere. America. Canada. Taiwan. none of them allow me to visit. And the police is always spying on me. I am suspecting that there is an undercover around. Now the only person I can trust... Is you. If you don't want to. no one is able to force you. You don't have to be afraid of the cops. I think you should watch out more from Pao's son. He just wants to be the leader. Don't you know that he is working with Mr. Ma to pick on you? I watched him growing up. why should I be scared of him?! Brother Fai-lone. precaution is better than cure. I told you many times. don't come up here alone. Listen to me. Let me tell you. if you don't listen to me. I will throw you off the roof. I dare you! I will tell dad. I will show you then. Sorry...I dare not... Mr. Ma and Fa worry me most. I punished Fa on that day. They will not let that incident just slide. Let me handle this. Don't mind Hung Hing's business anymore. I hope I don't have to. I am 40 years old. I am pretty successful in my business. If I mind Hung Hing's business again. My customers will be scared away. The worst thing is... That I can never get away from it. Triad society is not simple virus. Once you're infected. It'll follow you forever. It'll control you all the time. It's not curable. Excuse me. Be careful! Brother Sing. time to eat. Coming... - I want to sit on uncle's leg. - Come drink the soup. Okay! Sit on me. Sing. you are single. - Come up here more often to eat! - Okay. He is single?! He's got more women than I have. I just learned from you. brother Fai-lone. Don't get me into trouble. He is the smartest guy. Let me tell you one thing. don't judge a book by its cover. What a world record holder! One time I took a club girl out to eat. After I reached home. I went to the bathroom to piss. After I come out. she had already cleaned up everything. Dad pissed for so long! Don't talk something dirty. okay? Honey. I didn't say that. Our children said it. it has nothing to do with me! I envy you. You two are a perfect match. This has nothing to do with me. she is wonderful. She is well known. At home. she is a good house wife. To her kid. she is a nice mother but her kid is spoiled. - But in the bedroom... - Stop! I will dress as a nurse to take care of you. Very good. Last time you acted as a doctor. And it wasn't really successful. You guys help yourself. you don't have to wait for me. I've never seen mom acting so strange. Why don't we sent someone to follow her? No! If she is found out to be the wanted thief. It'll be shit. Ken. what? God-mother... You have to save me. god-mother. What's wrong? What have you done? No. god-mother. you must promise to help me. If you don't help me. I will be dead. - God-mother. help! - What's wrong? I owe Loan Shark Ko money. Luckily I ran away from them today. Or I would've been killed. If I don't pay him back soon. He will kill me. Lend me money. please... Get up. how much do you want? Not a lot. you will have it. How much? - 5...5... - $50.000?! $5.000? - $500.000! - $500.000?! God-mother. you have to help me. They will cut off my fingers. god-mother! $500.000?! How can I find so much money all of a sudden? You can make it... God-mother. take your jewelry to the pawn shop. okay? - Why don't you take my watch also? - Okay. If you want money. come out. Come. don't be scared! Fai-lone promised his dad to take care of you! Take out your hand. I will give it to you. Come on...Take it out. Fai-lone! - You come over here. - No... - Come here. - No... Get down on your knees. Why did you borrow money from Loan Shark Ko?! They are from Tung Shing. we are Hung Hing's members! What will people say if they find it out?! Look at me! I want you to know the reason why I hit you. No. Fai-lone. no... I will kill you today. Stop... Shut up! You are not young. why do you hit him for? I am old. you are a woman. This is men's business. Shut up and get out! Mrs. Lone... - Brother Fai-lone. - Let her go! Why does it have to turn out like this? Why can't we have a peaceful dinner and get it over with? Get up... Don't help him up. If you do. I will hit you too. Go eat. I can't help you. Brother Fai-lone. we are superior. I will respect him today and let you go. Disappear right now. One month. I don't want to see you for a month. Or I will throw you into the sea. Sam. take him to wash his face. Patch him up and send him away. Okay. Let's go! Asshole! You haven't lost your temper for ages. I don't care how people try to hurt me. or set me up. I hate seeing my own people become trash. Right. Ken is useless trash. If I didn't promise his dad. I would have given up on him long ago. Let me tell you. you should watch out for yourself. I know. go check on your wife! Why? I've watched enough of her. Hurry! Sorry! I don't care how you yell at me! But don't stare at me like that. I will get scared. What are you scared of? The way you stare at me reminds me of the look you wanted to kill. I haven't seen it for 6.7 years. It wasn't me. I worked hard for a long time. I finally gain a better life. Now something happened inside of Hung Hing. Are you going to lead them again? Since you are my wife. I will listen to you. I will try not to get involved with Hung Hing. You are so loyal. If your friend is in trouble. will you help him? I won't! I only want you to do one thing. Before you do anything. please think about your mom. Think of Henry. and me. I think of my mom. my son... But I have no idea... What would you look like if you dress like a nurse... Come... Go to the room. it is good for you. - Come on! - Thanks to you! How dare you peep at me? If I tell brother Sing. Do you think he will kill you or not? I want to shit. But it doesn't allow you to peek at me. Right! I want to know when you are coming out! I will tell brother Sing that you indecent assaulted me. I am innocent! So what? Just lay down here. don't move. Hurry! Want to sleep? Don't hit me. I...am hungry. You wanted to shit and you cried for hunger. What is the matter with you? I am really hungry! I want to shit and I am hungry. Move! You are a man! Why do you cry? Go to the bathroom! Cook me some noodles. Do it yourself. Fry me some luncheon meat then. I will fry your skin. What? I need to shit. move. Shit. How is it going outside? Very messy. Loan Shark Ko is not happy. he smashed many Hung Hing's turfs. I don't care. kick that fool out as soon as possible. Sing. There is a meeting with Loan Shark Ko at San Po restaurant. What for? Let's sit down and talk it over. I hope so. Okay. See you then. - You are leaving. - Yes! Don't hit me. - What are you doing? - What? Go change and go out to eat with me. Great! I love this idea. If it's not me. don't open the door. Be careful! Brother Sing. don't go. Loan Shark Ko is inside. Okay. Fai-lone's men are all here. We can get started at any time. Ken. you dare to come so you must have money to pay up. I came today is not for the loan. Brother Fai-lone will pay for him. Okay! Fai-lone has plenty of money. no problem! If this fool borrows money again. don't give a penny to him. We won't pay for him again. Okay! We have been waiting for almost 2 hours. Where's the beef? What do you want? Okay. you used a cop to kill my dad. What are you talking about? Asshole! You pick on my dad. So you used a cop to kill him. Am I right. brother Sing? Brother Fai-lone said that too. Brother Fai-lone didn't say it. you said it yourself. You hear me? Fai-lone retired long time ago. Don't use him to bluff me. Loan Shark Ko. I don't care what. You started the whole thing. You'd return the turf in Wanchai to Hung Hing now. Get your ass back to Chai Wan. I'll guarantee your safety. What?! You eat shit. What are you talking about? Why don't you go rob a bank? I will rob you first. If you don't want to. you will live in hell from now on. What?! Trying to scare me? Yes. speaking. Brother Chun. I am Sai. What? Loan Shark Ko's family is finished. - We have captured his wife. - Good. What are you doing? Brother Fai-lone told me to do it. it isn't my fault. Asshole! How is it? Let them fight among themselves first. Asshole! Come out. Stop! Don't move! Come back with me. No. something happened. Tell me about it later. Let's go. Mr. Cole. Why did you lock me up here for 10 hours? Do you know that the past 10 hours are very important to me? I know! You want to help Fai-lone to erase all the evidence against him. What are you talking about? I think you have betrayed us. You want to become a triad to make big money. Don't frame me! Fai-lone and Pao are buddies. Ko's family all died. He must be behind all of these. I told you many times. Fai-lone is no longer a triad. What will it take for you to believe me? Don't be silly. how will Fai-lone become a good man? Hung Hing's most dangerous person is Tong Pao's son. Chun. He is behind everything Don't tread me like an idiot! Can a 20 years old boy beat Fai-lone?! Wong Chi Sing. you are a cop. Please help me to nail Fai-lone. This is your job. Yes! I am a cop. My job is to arrest the criminal who broke laws. I'm not going to arrest nice guys you hate. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? You know it pretty well! Fai-lone can kick you ass even with hand-cuffs on. You can't stand losing face. So you have been looking for a chance to get him back. Don't treat me like an idiot! Behave yourself! What do you think it is? Sir. I'm reciting my statement. which I'm going to tell in court. So you won't obey my order. will you? I dare not. Sir! You cuff me everytime when you see me. Ming. Wai. lock him up. Wong Chi Sing. you can never get away. Excuse me! Boss. Judy. come out for a while. Sorry. - What? - There are two wolves next room. Oh thanks. I am not going. No. they are talking about Fai-lone and Sing. Go check it out. Thanks! I will take care of here for you. Stop acting sweet. Don't make me do you right here. Sorry. boss. I will drink this glass as my punishment. okay? What are you doing? Okay. Let's drink together. Wrong room. sorry! No. come in. come sit here. Come on. Take a seat. Move! I like to sit here. This chair is better. This is a nice girl. I think I can have so much fun tonight. I won't play with you tonight! My name is gold fish. Right? My men call you a dead fish. Take that asshole out. I will have plenty to enjoy tonight. Let's fix Fai-lone first. Boss... Go out... What's wrong? She is drunk. no problem! They are all here. We can start at any time. Later. send some men to capture him in his place. At the same time. send someone to capture his wife at the club. I already sent three girls to play Mahjong with her. - Why hold them apart? - You are so stupid! Fai-lone is very tricky. what if we can't catch him? If we have his wife. sure he'll appear. If he won't come. our men can have lots of fun. What should we do now? Why don't you take this drunken bitch to go have some fun? Or wait for Fai-lone's wife. You decide it. Thanks! Come again. bye! What the hell?! You are lucky. What a bad luck. Let's go! You don't want to wait for her? Why? I don't like this kind of chick anyways. What a waste! Fifty thousand. What kind of hand is this? I lost again. Five folds. The game is finished. It's still early. Iet's play couple more rounds. You won all our money. we lost much. We want to have a chance to win back our money. - Yes. - Are we good friends? Come on. Let's play! I don't know what is wrong with you people. All you guys think of is playing Mahjong. What is it? Poor business. you know. We wish we were all like you to have a wealthy husband. Look at your watch. it is worth few hundred thousand dollars. Okay...4 more rounds. - Okay... - I want to a piss first. Change our seats... Hurry back and let me win my money back. Got it! - Hurry back! - I am waiting! Go call Fa now. Fa. where are you? She is about to suspect. Mrs. Lone? Who are you? I am Sing's girlfriend. Judy. What are you doing here? Someone wants to kidnap you. these girls are trying to trap you here. No wonder those bitches kept letting me win. Let's go! Let's check the back door. - It's locked. - Follow me. Let's try the side door. It's locked too. what should we do? Hold this. Mrs. Lone. can we not do this? Do you want to get raped? Or you want to kill those assholes? Hole this. Bitch. freeze! Don't move. You bitches! How dare you betray me? No...I...I didn't want to. I owe Fa a lot of money. I didn't want to. Judy. tie them up. Bitch! Come here... Go get the car. What should we do? - Drive! - Why do you take my car? Drive. What the hell? Why do you take my car? Move! Sam. open the door. Who is it? What are you doing here? Fai-lone doesn't want to see you. I want to see my god-mother. I want to pay her back. okay? What kind of excuse is this?! I am not happy. I insist to see my god-mother and pay her back. Do you want a lesson again? I don't like to give it to you. God-mother. I came to pay you back... How come it is so noisy? Dad. it is very noisy outside. Sam. what's going on? Is that Ken? Bring him in. Open up. Go to hell! Sam... Ken. what is it? What? What is it. Loan Shark Ko? You should know what you have done. Let my mother go. - Fai-lone. run! - Shut up! What do you want? What do I want? How dare you ask me that? You sent people to kill my whole family and raped my wife. You have no say here! I didn't do it. You didn't do it? Right. you just gave the order. Your men did it! Chun told me everything! Chun told you?! Okay. I will be responsible for what I've done. Let my mother and my son go. You said it! I never get people's family involved. Let his mother and son go. No! The truth is. it has nothing to do with brother Fai-lone. That is my order. But about your wife... Fa did it. Fa?! Fa. you act fast and clean. I thought that all idiots have died. But there are two more left. But my dad is even more stupid. He struggled with you all his life. You guys fought together. but you got all the money. Right? Although you feel ease. I am not. My dad has nothing left. But only a name is left. I wanted to get back what is supposed to be his share. I will tell you what I want. I want all your money. I can't believe brother Pao deserves such a bad son. I hate people talking bad things about my dad behind his back. Although he is an asshole! Take his mother out! Mom... Fai-lone. don't mind me. Take good care of her. Okay. got it. Fa. if you dare touch my mom. I will kill your whole family. I am scared! I am really scared! To hell with you! Mom...Stop! Stop! Mom... Stop! Fat boy. go beg your god-brother. Or your god-mother will be dead. Beg! Brother Fai-lone. it is not my fault... I owed him lots of money. he forced me to do this. Brother Fai-lone. you have so much money. Just listen to him. just give him money. We can start all over again. right? Can you? You are dead already. Okay! What do you want? Say it. Didn't I tell you earlier? You must be old. you are losing your memory. Let me tell you again. I have no sense of security. So I want to hire body guards. but it takes money. What do you think? Okay. I will give it to you. but... Let them go first. Thanks! Although it is your wish. I'm a bit corny. I do believe in laws. I hope you will sign this contract. And give everything to me. officially. After it is done. I will let them go. Fai-lone. don't trust him. he won't let us live. I don't have any other choices. Okay. Good! How long are you going to keep me here? Let him go! Get out of here! Go! What is going on outside? Let me tell you. you can go now. I am asking you. what is going on outside? I don't need you. I already have a warrant for Fai-lone. Let me tell you. Ko and his men died in Fai-lone's house. And Fai-lone's whole family fled away. What else do you want to ask? No way! Then why did he flee? He must be kidnapped. Stop making up story. Let me tell you. you are dismissed as an undercover. If you still want to be a police. Type a rehabilitation letter now. I will take you to the chief and complain against you. It is up to you! Drink some water. Mrs. Lone. Don't smoke so much. Your lung will turn black. I don't know what I can do other than smoking. I will play chess with you. May be Fai-lone and Sing will come back soon. Little girl. don't worry about me. Ever since I have been with Fai-lone. I have prepared for today. Tell you the truth. you looked awesome while holding the knife. I've never seen one wearing an expensive watch to kill people! So? Mrs. Lone. I am happy that you are okay. No one answered the phone at home. Do you know where they are? I think Chun has kidnapped them. What about my mother-in-law and Henry? If Chun didn't have them in his hands. They couldn't kidnap brother Fai-lone that easily. But the biggest problem right now is. Ko died in your house. The police will put Fai-lone on the wanted list. That asshole is evil! He kidnapped Fai-lone. people think that he ran away. Why don't we get more men to fix Chun? It is useless! Everyone in Hung Hing is on his side. If we are going to do it. three of us are enough. Mrs. Lone. do you have any idea? Let me go look for Chun! Where are you going after work? Come with me. Mrs. Lone... You can't go in there! Mr. Lone... Okay. Leave it to me. you can go now. They are great. You go first. - Mrs. Lone. you can't go inside. - You can't go inside. I want to see Chun. - Mrs. Lone. don't go in there... - Mrs. Lone... Mrs. Lone? Don't you know that brother Fai-lone gave this company to me?! I have something to tell you. Me too. come in. Mrs. Lone. don't move. I need a search. Thanks! Please... What are you guys doing? Are you guys crazy? You think Mrs. Lone will bring a gun here to kill me? Boss. I'm sorry! Sorry. follow me. Sorry! Mrs. Lone. You should know that Fai-lone has fled away. right? Now I know. Can I call you Daisy? Whatever. I don't know why. the first time I saw you. I had a very strange feeling. Stop wasting your time. What do you want to set Fai-lone free? I don't have him. He killed Ko and ran away. He took his mother and son to Europe. Brother Chun. I am only a woman. I don't care about you men's business. Is Fai-lone alive or dead? He is not dead! But he is useless now! Because he has to go to jail for at least 20 years. Let me take care of you from now on. Tong Man-chun. Where is Fai-lone? Where? Fai-lone. mom got you into this. It's okay. don't worry! What are you doing here? Go. Are you okay. god-mother? Drink some water okay? Come on. Brother Fai-lone. drink some water. If you are still a man. Help me find Sing. If they find out. they will kill me. No way. - Drink some water first. - Whatever! Fat boy. where are you going? Brother Fa. Fai-lone is cunning! I wanted to give him some water. He...told me to call Sing to come save him. Why don't you go? I won't do it! See? I came to tell you. - You are smart! - Yes. Go teach him a lesson. I will go look out for you. Who are you trying to lie to? Go to hell! You want to die. right? Throw his son off the roof. Help... Henry... Ma'am. you look good. You know how to dance. right? No? Let me teach you. Feel free to hit them. But let me tell you. If anything happens to anyone of them. I promise that you won't get a penny. Come on. I beg you. Let my god-mother go. You promised me that you won't hurt her! You only want money. You should go ask Chun for it. Fai-lone gave all the money to Chun. If you want. go mess with Chun but leave my god-mother alone! Don't move! Mr. Ma. Sing. come save us. Let brother Fai-lone and his family go. Let brother Chun go first. Let him go?! If I didn't capture him. He would have taken the money and run away. You idiot! Did you hear me? He is pointing a gun at my head. Put down your gun! Why should we be afraid of him? If anything happens to me. You won't get a dime. Say it or I am going to kill you. Okay! Put down the gun! Put it down. Let brother Fai-lone go. God-mother. I came to save you! Let's go... Fai-lone. get in the car. God-mother. don't be afraid. Rush out immediately when it's opened. Remember. call the police at once. Don't go home. got it? Be very careful! Run! Stop! - Ken! - Run! Sing. get in the car! Let's go! Damn it! Thanks. Sing. Don't worry. you should thank Mrs. Lone. Take good care of my son and mother-in-law. Daisy. are you okay? Daisy. Daisy. Sing. call an ambulance. please! Hold on. it's going to be okay. Brother Fai-lone. Uncle Sai. Daisy was pretty when she was alive. Don't worry! Brother Fai-lone. If I can't make Mrs. Lone Iooks better than she was before. I will quit. I will put you in charge of her funeral. I will take good care of it. I know that you can hear me. Don't worry. I will take good care of our son. I will send him to study in England. When you were alive. I promised you one thing. I wouldn't mind any of Hung Hing's business. But now you left me. I have no other choice. Brother Fai-lone. Gather all the men. I want Chun! I think we should call the police. Cops won't believe me. I believe you. Because I am a cop. I know. I knew it all along. But why do you still trust me? I know you. You won't hurt me. Besides. it is good to have an undercover next to me. At least the police knows what I am doing! I am not a cat. I don't have to be afraid of dogs. I can't let you seek revenge. You can't stop me. Don't force me. If I don't fix Chun today. I can't even forgive myself for that. Sorry! Tell me. what should I do? You should know that I always listen to you. Kill. So little money! Tong Man Chun. you are arrested. You have the rights to remain silent. But everything you say... will be used against you in court. This is a warrant. What crime did I commit?! Mr. Tong Man Chun. Stop playing around. Police. Brother Sing. help. He can't help you. Don't come over. Don't do anything stupid. I will blow his head off. Get out! Move aside. Don't come over. Office Cole. call an ambulance. Damn cop. asshole! Didn't you like to play on the roof? Come here. Are you scared? Didn't you like to play on the roof? Come here! If I knew things would turn out like this. I would have thrown you off the roof when you were little. So you wouldn't hurt anyone and yourself. Brother Fai-lone. no regrets! Even if you kill me. you won't get away. If you take me to the police station. At least I can tell them you didn't kill Ko. If I die. you will have to run away. I will give the company back to you. okay? Should I say thank you?! You are old. you are losing your memory. Do you still remember? I told you if you didn't listen to me. I would throw you off the roof. You really think I don't dare? I will throw you off right now. Don't move! Brother Fai-lone. You can't kill him. you tried so hard to go straight. Don't waste your effort on such scum. Brother Fai-lone. Listen to him. stop it. No! Let him go now or I am going to shoot. Okay! Go ahead. Brother Fai-lone. if you don't care about yourself. Think about your son. Your wife in heaven doesn't want to see you in jail. Thanks for listening to brother Sing. Don't be stiff-necked. You knew there are no bullets in that gun. didn't you? So you used my gun to kill him. When a man gets older. her gets smarter. I am not like you cops. I'm not stiff-necked about principles. Thanks!
