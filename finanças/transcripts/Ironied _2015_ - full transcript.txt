So anyway, she, you know she was like a sister to me You know she was lived on the streets like us like eh? and uh... So my buddy had a bottle and a pipe. And so we had a drink to her And...uhh Drank for a bit, and then I said goodbye to him. and uh... Strange thing. I'm walking down the street, and I walk past my ex-wife and daughter. I think she's a teenager now Yeah, t...teenager. I think it's been around 15 years Oh First time I'd seen 'em. Wife recognized me. Daughter did not. Probably a good thing, right? Cause uh... anyway Yeah, we lost a baby when we were married. just after she was born and uh... She left me and I started drinking pretty heavy, and then uh... I lost my job and uh... So... And I, I was in the park later that day and uh... these little sons of bitches, they beat up on me I don't know who they were. I didn't say anything to him. I did nothing. They kicked my face. They kicked me in the ribs and in the crotch Yeah, sorry about the smell. But... And, uh... Passed out, it's all blurry after that. When I woke up, again Um...
