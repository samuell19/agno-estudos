Tear it off for me, please! Throw it to me! Well, hurry up! Don't you be smart with me! This apple is mine! Halt, halt! What's the matter? Where are you carrying away my apple? This is my apple. It fell and I caught it! Immediately give me back my apple! Stop it! This is my apple! I tore it off! No, it's my apple! I found it first! What's happening? Why all this noise? Why all this noise? Answer me! You, Mikhail Ivanovich, are the largest animal of the forest, and the smartest. Arbitrate between us fairly. Whose apple is this? As you decide, so it will be. Who found this apple? That's me. It was hanging on the apple tree. Who tore off the apple? It was me! I caught the apple. Well... Okay. Well, it's like this... All of you are right. Therefore each of you has a right to the apple. But we have only one apple! So divide the apple equally, and each of you take one piece. Why didn't we think of it earlier? Yeah. Yeah. That's how it goes! This is for you, Hare. Because you were the first to notice the apple. This is for you. Because you tore off the apple This is for me. Because I caught the apple. And this is for you, Mikhail Ivanovich! Why should I get a piece? Because you were able to reconcile us and teach us common sense. Well, thank you, thank you! Oh, how delicious! That is true! And we're not annoyed! Here the first tale ends, and the second tale begins... The Magic Wand Hey! Prickly head! Where are you hurrying to? I'm going home. Me too. Let's go together! Come on. When you are not alone, the road seems shorter. Ai!! Oh, oh... Take that! Why do you need that stick? What's it good for?! This is not a simple stick. This is a magic wand! Whoa! ha ha ha ha Hey, you, prickly head! Throw away your stick! You'll never make it across the river with it! Ah-ha-ha! You're such a weirdo! Why do you bathe your stick? Magic wand, magic wand! Turn into a jumping pole! Wow! You can really jump! I don't know how to jump at all. My magic wand helped me! Why do you trudge like a turtle? I bet that stick's slowing you down! Oh! Oh! I'm drowning! Come on, grab the stick! Hold on tightly! Magic wand, magic wand! You will now pull him out! Oh, ah! Thank you, Hedgehog! You saved me! Don't be silly! It's the magic wand that pulled you out of the swamp. Help us, help! Take the stick and stand close to the tree Magic wand, magic wand Turn into a crane! Thank you, thank you! Wow! Look, Hedgehog, again your magic wand has helped us! Of course! And you wanted to throw it away! Oh, hello! Welcome! Long time no see! You, Hedgehog, I will not touch, because you're prickly. Off you go! What are you still standing around for? Get away while you can! Goodbye, Bunny ... Farewell, Hedgehog... Scat! Well, now we have no one else to bother us! Magic wand, magic wand Turn into a bludgeon! And now, I'll make you into a nice m... Ai! Well, here we are! Now your path lies to the right, and mine lies to the left. Yeah! If it wasn't for your magic wand, I would've never seen home again! Then take it. Maybe you'll yet find it of some use. But how will you ever manage without it? Never mind. A stick can be gotten anywhere. But the magic... The true magic is here! Ah! That's right! The true magic is here! THE END Subs by Eus, ed. Niffiwan after a Zhurka75 translation
