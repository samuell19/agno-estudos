[piano playing] [people chatting] Man: I got it. Man #2: I'm going back to the limo. [overlapping conversations] - Natalie. - Nice to see you. Pardon my incredulity, Natalie, but I'm very surprised to see you here. Pleasantly so, of course. I'm a little surprised to see myself here, too, Mary Alice. Pleasantly so, of course. - [chuckles] - Were you here last year? No, I wasn't invited last year. Oh. Curious. That must have been an accident. Oh, do you know Libby? No, I don't believe I do. Libby, this is Natalie Standish. Natalie is Reed's... oh, is it all right to, uh... Say that Reed got me pregnant when I was a barhop at your country club, married me to avoid scandal, spent the next 10 years sucking the life out of me, got bored with me, dumped me and screwed me in court? Sure. Go ahead. - [coughs] - [chuckles] Natalie is Reed's ex-wife. Oh. Libby Percy Holt. Natalie Warjecheski Standish. Well, are you unescorted tonight? No, I'm with someone, a friend, male. Well, if the new fella comes by, be sure and point him out to us. Oh, I don't think I'll have to do that. You'll know him when you see him. [piano music continues] [rattles] [rattles] [dog growls] [barking] Oh, great. Come on. - [grunting] - [snarling] Get out of here. [barking] [chuckles] Feisty little guy. [sniffs] I don't care for caviar. I make it a rule never to eat anything a fish deposits in a riverbed. [laughs] Right? It's been awfully nice meeting you... - Dutch. - Indeed. Nice meeting you. - Hi. - How are you? I missed you. Hello, Natalie. Reed Standish. Dutch Dooley. You look great. I didn't expect to see you here. I didn't expect to see you either. I thought you were going down to spend some time with Doyle. Something came up. I have to go to London in the morning. How does Doyle feel about that? Haven't been able to reach him yet. Well, you'll be talking to him. You can tell him. You haven't told him you're not coming? I'm sorry. Could you excuse us? This is personal. Where the hell did you find him? Look, you can call Doyle, okay? I'm tired of doing the dirty work for you. I'm being very nice to you. I gave you a house to live in with your truck driver. - He's not a truck driver. - Don't interrupt. You get a monthly check, a house to live in, and you get joint custody of Doyle. You give me a hard time, you'll lose it all. You wouldn't dare play fair, would you? I wouldn't dare lose. Have a nice holiday. Excuse me. I know that what you were saying to Natalie was personal. I understand. I'm involved with her now, so this is personal, too. You hurt her, and I'll hit you so fucking hard, your dog'll bleed, okay? Nice meeting you. [piano music continues] I just feel weak and used. He took you out of your life, put you in his and took off. I mean, you don't need him or his house or his money or his friends. Make it on your own. There's only one thing he has that I want. Well, what the heck would you do with a set of tiny little genitals? [chuckles] - I'm being serious. - I'm sorry. He has my son. [bells chime] [air hissing] [cello playing] [phone ringing] Boy: Hello. I'd like to speak to Doyle Standish, please. Oh. [scoffs] Yeah. Hold on. Doyle. Doyle. [sighs] - Do you know how to knock? - Your ma's on the phone. Do you know how to knock? The door was open. It wasn't open. It was unlocked. Someone from any sort of decent background would knock. And she's not my "ma." I don't have a "ma." You may have a "ma." I have a mother, okay? Do you wanna take the call, shithead? I could have you written up for profanity. Yeah? I'm terrified. I will have you written up. Working in the kitchen will be good for you, Teddy. You can have a taste of what your career at Burger King will be like. What makes you think you're so superior? I don't have to think. It's sickening how much you love yourself. Yeah. I guess it would be to someone who's enrolled here only because his father is an employee. At least I have a father. - Yes? - Doyle? Hi, sweetheart. What do you want? I'm calling about Thanksgiving. What about it? I'd like you to come home. For the umpteenth time, I'll be with Dad. [sighs] Dad can't be with you, honey. He has to go to Europe. Um, he told me last night. So if he's made any plans with you, obviously he'll have to break them. I... I really want you to come home, Doyle. So you can get my approval of your new boyfriend? To appease your guilt? Look, you are old enough to be objective about me and your father and to understand why we're in the situation we're in. Yeah, I know. I understand. You couldn't make it work. If you could see both sides, you'd know that that isn't true. I love you, honey, and... and I want you home. L... I've booked you a flight on Wednesday, and I expect you to be on it. Forget it! I'm not coming home to spend a holiday with you or the idiot you're sharing the house with, okay? He is not sharing the house with me, and he is hardly an idiot. [sighs] I love you, sweetheart. [scoffs] [dial tone] [laughing] Little trouble on the home front? - Aww. - What a jerk. Dutch: You talk to your son yet? Mm-hmm. And? I don't know. I have a ticket for him. I know he won't use it. Do you want to go down and get him? He won't appreciate that. How about if I go down? There's no better way for two guys to get to know each other than to spend a couple of days in a car. Dutch, he doesn't want to know you. Well, from what I can gather, all he wants to do is sit alone in a room and hate people. There's a fair amount of truth in that. Let me go down and get him. I'm an interested third party. I'm a communicator. I'm a breakthrough kind of guy. You know, I've handled some pretty tough birds in my time. And when the smoke cleared, almost without exception... I had a new friend. [ticking] [rings] [sniffs] Smells good. I want to do this for you. It's important. If we're gonna be together from now on, I'm gonna have to have a good relationship with Darren. Doyle. [grunting] [grunting continues] [pounds] Doyle. What do you want? My parents wanted to know if, since you're not going home, you'd wanna come over to our house for Thanksgiving. Don't think I could handle that much fun. Is that a no? That's a no. Great. Have a nice weekend rotting in your own pissed-off world. [yells] Peggy, it's me. I'm at O'Hare. Listen, I'm flying down to Atlanta to pick up my girlfriend's kid from school. Yeah, it came up unexpectedly. Tell Tug and Fritz I'll be incommunicado, they should take care of anything that comes up. I'll be back on Monday. Listen, lady, don't jerk me around, okay? I have a letter from him saying that he's going to pick me up. Now give me his number in London.

I don't think you know who I am. - [fires] - Ohh! Son of a... Ow! Give me the gun! Give me the gun! Ahh! [cracks] No, you don't. Sit. I'm Dutch Dooley. I'm a friend of your mother's. I know she called you. What the hell are you beating me up for? [groans] I feel the pain in my crotch in my teeth. Does campus security know you're here? Can you say, "I'm sorry I hit you with a golf club, kicked your face, mashed your testes, shot you twice"? If that's too much, a simple hello would do. Answer my question. You can't say that? Of course I can say it. I choose not to. - Now can you? - No. Well, I have to shoot you. Now, since we might be legally related someday, I'm gonna give you the option of taking it on the backside. Won't hurt as bad. If you shoot me, I'll have you arrested. Well, I'll have to make it look like an accident, then. All right, you win. Clearly. Now leave. I told your mother I'd take you home for the holidays. I have plans. Stay here? You gonna watch the football game, make a turkey sandwich and hang yourself in the toilet? I said I have plans. Leave it at that. Now please go. Waiting for your dad? I don't have to tell you anything. He's not coming. You don't know my dad, so shut up. I know he's in London. Is that a fact? We have a very big problem here. I suppose we do. I have a problem because I said I'd pick you up.

What, you mean like in big people's court or some school teen court where if I'm found guilty, I gotta roll naked in the snow or make a bed with my teeth? My father is one of the most powerful men in the country. When he hears what you did to me, he'll sue your working-class ass into complete and total destitution. How you do you know I'm working class? From your cheap shoes to your ridiculous hairstyle to your crude vocabulary to my mother's taste in men. You scream it. Huh. All right. Is working class bad? If you want to get into a political discussion, I'll shred you. No, it's not bad. Solid economy needs hand workers. Well, I used to drive a cement truck. My father was a bricklayer. My mother used to work in the laundry at the Ponchartrain Hotel in Detroit. You must be very proud. I am. I still owe you that shot in the ass. You want to get it over with, in case it's gnawing on your mind? You know, you might be the toughest little whacker in the junior high, but in my world, you're about as worrisome as a cloudy day. [thunder rumbling] Dutch: You got anything to say? Me, I like to talk. I love to talk, live to talk. You got any amusing anecdotes? I'm living through one right now. There's some truth there. Yeah, this is a trip we won't soon forget, huh? You can count on it. [laughs] These are the Cumberland Mountains. Beautiful, aren't they? [chuckles] You know what? The more you babble, the more you reveal yourself as an insecure fool who's deathly afraid he's gonna blow his chance at my mother. What chance, Duncan? My name's Doyle. And the chance I'm referring to has dollar signs in front of it. A chance at your mom's money? Bingo. I may not look like I could finance a trip to the zoo, but the truth is I make a pretty good living. My income's a damn sight more than your father gives your mother to live on. Oh, yeah, but my money doesn't count in your neighborhood, because I worked for it. Working for your money doesn't matter in your part of the world.

The kid's got emotional problems, and the last thing he needs is police trouble. Take this. Put it towards any repairs you might have and your time. If it's not enough, call me. My number's on the card, okay? Thanks. I appreciate it. If it wasn't for your daddy, I'd have busted every bone in your body. Show's over. Go home. Go home. Listen, you little son of a bitch. You could have killed somebody with a stunt like that. That poor bastard was on his way home to see his family, and because you wanna play some kind of a spoiled-brat prank, you put his life in jeopardy. Now, what gives you the right to do that, huh? I guess I didn't think about that. Well, you better start thinking about a little something else besides your own spoiled ass. I took on this idiotic assignment because I love your mother. I gotta wonder how nuts I am. Man, I've met some scum in my life, but you beat all, man. You are absolutely worthless. You know what? This isn't a joke anymore. This is a full-blown mission. You're not gonna beat me. I've had my head split open, my nose mashed. I've been kicked and beat and left for dead, and when I set you down on your mama's doorstep, you're gonna be one whipped little puppy. Don't flatter yourself. Get your hands down. I'm not taking any more of your crap. You touch me once more, you'll be sorry. You wanna go, is that it? You want me to go? Hell, I'd love to go. You wanna go? - Yeah. - Okay, fine. Let's see if your punch is as big as your mouth. Only, this time, no sissy kicks, okay, no geometry, no kamikaze tricks, no sucker punches, just good, all-American street fighting. Let me show you how to do it, all right? Here. Give me your little digits. Here. That's it. Curl your little digits, and you wad those up in little, bitty balls like that. Watch your little thumbies. Put your thumbies out here so you don't break 'em. Get loose. That's it. Bend your little knees. That's it. Okay, let me see you fight like a man, okay? Now, you take the first shot. Give me your best punch, all right? Come on. Come on. Give it to me, pipsqueak. [wind blowing] [bird squawks] [overlapping conversations] How'd you sleep, ace? - Okay. - Good. How's your face? Fine. No problem. Partial apology if I did any permanent damage. It'd take a lot more than you got to give me any permanent damage. Now, my doctor wants me to get my cholesterol to under 1,000, but, uh, hot cakes and bacon on a cold day, pretty sexy. I want you to know that I could have hurt you a lot more than I did. - Yeah. - Seriously. - I'm a high brown belt. - Yeah? Yeah. I been training for three years. [sighs] Your working-class ego can't handle a kid of my position and standing beating you up, can it? My working-class ego can handle that and a hell of a lot more. Are you admitting that I could defeat you in a fight? Why don't you shut up? I beat you mentally. Then I beat you physically. You know, yesterday you had nothing to say. Today you're a parrot. I'm ready here. You know, for a split second last night, I sort of respected you for how you handled the cops and the accident, but today I see my initial impression is correct. You're a clod. And the cool part is I could say that and you can't do anything about it, 'cause I can kick your butt. Well, I won't cop to that, but I will say this. There's one thing I can do that you can't. What? I can pay for my breakfast. [burps] [pats stomach] Nothing burps better than bacon. Your water looked tasty. You're insane. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to hitchhike? You have a high brown belt. What are you worried about? You're an idiot. You got a better way to get home? We're not without means, for God's sake. We are at the moment. We got 20 bucks. You ever heard of a telephone? Call my mother. I'll call my grandfather. You know, someday you're gonna get into a situation where you can't call for help. You'll have to depend on yourself, and you'll let yourself down. I'm not calling, because I don't want your mother to think we can't make it home on our own. Call it male pride, old-fashioned, pigheaded, working-class pre-fax machine/car-phone, masculine pride. No accountants, no lawyers, no mommies, no daddies, no Washington lobbyist, just a man and his wits. [chuckles] Yeah, that's helpful when you're facedown, dead in a ditch. That's part of it, too. But you roll the dice, you take what you get. [dog barking] [bird cawing] Dutch: We're not doing too good here. [hip-hop music playing] Excuse me. Does that music have to be so loud? [turns off music] Thank you. [woman coughing] What'd you pay for them shoes? Did you steal 'em? I charged them. Hmm. See, my friend here really wants those shoes. Well, we're really movin' now, huh? [whistles] It's your mother. Come on, talk to her. [water splashing] Getting hungry for your turkey dinner? Remember, I'm your dad. I got a bad heart. Dale, look at me. Is that your most pathetic look? This is my "death to you" look. That's not gonna get us a ride. Be pathetic! Try it! Pretend that you're not gonna get $10 million when you're 21. You have no plan, do you? I got a rough outline. Actually, I'm the idiot 'cause I'm going along with it. [sobs] See? Hands up. Try it. [whimpers] Come on. [whimpers] Look up. Look up. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [whimpering] Hurry. It's freezing. All right. Oh, no. Oh, my God. That's it. Smile, smile. Smile. That's it. Smile with that face. [panting] Attaboy, attaboy. Oh, help us here, please. [moaning] it's pathetic. It is really pathetic. Beg. Help me. [whimpering] Help me. I don't have a ride. Help me. Help me. We have to help them. You want a ride, you gotta look grievous. Huh? [Dutch moaning] Hey, kid! We're going to Hammond. Do you wanna come along? Get the suitcase. Let's go. We got a ride. Come on, let's go.

Yeah, it's your mother's fault. Why is it her fault? Because she gave birth to you. - And what about your mother? - My mother's a saint. For what, having puppies? Oh. Oh, you want more, huh? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. [truck horn blows] Come and get it. Chicken! - [cloth rips] - Ahh! - [truck horn blows] - Ohh! [groans] God, you're pathetic. Here's the deal, Dobsy. I had 200 bucks in the wallet. - You said you were broke. - I lied. You dishonest, stupid jerk. We had money all this time? We could have been home. Probably, but I had this plan. - Yeah, I know. - No, you don't know! I know you were playing around, stretching this whole thing out so we could get to know each other, and then it blew up in your face. I blew it. I'm sorry. I'm also out of ideas. I'm just gonna sit here and hope I get arrested so I can get some sleep. Call your mother. Have her send somebody for you. You can call, can't you? I don't want to call. I'm sitting here, and that's it. You talk to your mom. You tell her that I said, uh, good luck. Tell her the Dutchboy's calling it quits. You're dumping my mom? I'm sparing her of a life of this kind of misery. She's gonna blame me. I'll write a letter for you, nice letter, okay? Go on. I thought you loved her. I've talked and talked and talked to you until I could puke coat hangers. I'm me. You're you. There's no reason on Earth why we should spend any more time with each other. Okay. I just think it's really sick that you'd cut my mom loose because you can't get along with me. Why? You hate her. Don't fret. It's okay. She puts up with your crap, she can handle mine. I never said that I hated her. No. Gee, I'm sorry. You're "the picture's worth a thousand words" guy. Yeah. Now, go on. Go on. Make your call. Give me some peace. I don't hate my mother for the record. Kiss my ass for the record! Act like a rodent around somebody else. You've busted my balls. Congratulations. Go on. Did she ever say that she thinks I hate her? [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Don't get it. Hello. Is... is Mr. Standish in? [whispering] He's sleeping. Who's this? Mmm. Who was it? Some kid. Come on. We can make it home. We got this far, didn't we? - Where you going? - Home. How? I'm calling your mom. Enough of this. Wait a minute. It would really mean a lot to me to not have to call my mother for help. You remember this? I still owe you one. You let me call your mom, I forget about it. - No dice. - This isn't working out. We're not masters of the highway. We were robbed by homebound hookers. Only because you fell asleep and I got... ...horny. You did? Sort of. Congratulations. Slap it. There you go. See, I'm not such a bad guy, huh? Yeah, yeah, you are.

[chuckles] [Dutch groans] I could sue you for this. [groans] Hey, the kid doesn't mean it. I do so. And you can't hit me, 'cause I'm a minor. [laughs] [whimpers] - Hey, hey. - [chuckles] Hey, you okay? Hey, I told you guys to get out of here. Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? - What the hell... - Hey! We don't want any trouble, all right? Hey! Give me my stick back. Relax, all right? Why don't you guys go inside and we'll hit the road, all right? [groans] - Get away from him! - Yeah, yeah.

Dutch: All right, now you guys really did it. You got him angry. Pete, let's go. You don't have to shoot 'em. Pete, you don't have to shoot 'em! You don't have to shoot 'em, Pete. The kid is crazy. Don't be crazy, Pete. Don't be crazy, Pete. Tell the voices that you just killed somebody. You know, that guy. You just killed somebody! - Yeah! - [gasping] Uhh! Ohh, I just killed somebody! He just killed somebody. They won't listen. Don't shoot me. I gotta do it. I gotta get rid of the voices! Listen, listen, it's the holiday season. These guys probably got families. - I do! - Yeah. - I do! He's single. - Why'd you say that? Now I gotta kill your families, too. Dutch: Calm down, Pete. Look, forget these guys. We'll find some nice motel you can burn down. Guard: Yeah, motel, lots of people. Okay. You guys are very lucky. This kid hardly ever backs off once he gets his neck up. Dutch: So long, guys. [door opens] Excuse me, but would you please get out of here? This isn't a warming house, you know. Boy has a wound on his head. We need to use the restroom. I'm so sorry, but from time to time, these road people wander in. Excuse me. I said out. - Can he wash his face? - No! I'll go outside. Let him use the bathroom. Robert, you want to come over here and help me? Excuse us. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. You're on the road? Yeah. Why? The boy's your son? That's right. We're up from Georgia on our way to Chicago. Lost our car. We got robbed. - Oh, God. - It's all right. [chorus singing] Man: They'll take good care of you here. Who? Well, this is a center for displaced families. Mike's supervisor is on the board. So, good luck, all right? Don't give up. Okay? Have a little faith in your father. He's doing his best, okay? All right. Bye-bye. Let's go, hon. Bye-bye. And, uh, all our best for a happy holiday. [horn honks] Would you like to see the wine list? That's mine. You can have it. That was nice. [man coughing] [siren blaring] [snoring] - [gasping] - Jeez! [people muttering] Son of a... You have to click it. Is there a problem? No, no, I got it. Thanks. [clatters] Ahh, jeez. - [snaps] - Shh! [clattering] Shh! [creaks] Woman: Trying to get some sleep here. Woman #2: It's all right now. Come on. - [man coughs] - [girl cries] [people muttering] - [creaks] - [metal clangs] [whispering] Doyle. Switch cots with me. - Mine won't hold me. - [clangs] How do you know it'll hold me? Because I'm 15,000 cheeseburgers ahead of you in life. [dog barking] [man coughing] Hi. You from Hammond? - Chicago. - Oh. I'm from South Bend originally. Came to Hammond to look for work, me and my husband. Lost his job in June, worked for one of those auto part companies that went broke. We've been here for about a week. It's nice. We was living out of the back of our car. That's kind of hard. What about you? We got here tonight. You and your daddy? Yeah. Do you have a mother? But she's not with you, though, huh? Where's she at, Chicago? Yeah. And I bet you'd like to be with her right now, wouldn't you? Yes. Yeah, I would. It'll happen. Hope so. That's all any of us in here can do. What? Hope. You'd better get some sleep. Okay. Doyle. While you were brushing your teeth, I called your mom. I told her we were at the Holiday Inn so she wouldn't worry. Is that okay? Yeah. You know, 'cause I said I wouldn't call. No. No, that's okay. Good night. Did you hear me talking? No, not really. I meant it. I appreciate it. You still gonna shoot me in the ass? Yes. Good night. Dutch: Good night.

[clears throat] [ducks quacking] [car engine sputters] You take care, the both of you, now. Now, you call the office first thing Monday morning. I'll see what I can do for you. - Doyle, happy Thanksgiving. - I will. - Thanks. - Good luck. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving. [doorbell rings] Hey, buddy! Surprise. Huh? Mom. I'm sorry. Could you step outside? This is a family matter. Now, why don't you say goodbye to your mother? Why don't you come to my house? We've got a lot to talk about, huh? I canceled an important overseas trip to spend this holiday with you. No, you didn't. I called your house, and a lady answered. - You lied to me. - Don't talk to me that way. It's true. You make up your mind right now, Doyle. Are you coming with me or are you staying here? Your decision is final. I'm staying here, Dad. Ah, fine. I want you out of here by Monday. Excuse me. You wanted Natalie out by when? Monday. I'm sorry, I didn't quite... I said... - [duck quacking] - [wings flapping] [shudders] Friday? Well, she's probably gonna need a little more time. Uh... - How's six months sound to you? - No problem. And you're gonna be a little more respectful of Natalie? Absolutely. And you're gonna work on being a nice guy with your son because he still loves you. He's a great kid. He doesn't deserve having his feelings hurt or his mind played with, especially not by his dad. [moans] I like him a lot. I'm his friend, but, see, I'm never gonna be his father. That's your job. You'd better learn to do it. Yes, sir. Good. - Pleasure seeing you again. - [grunts] Happy holidays. - Thank yo... thank you. - Hey. [Reed chuckles] Whoa! I'm okay. [car starts] - And here it is. - Dutch: Oh, good. - Doyle: Oh, wow. - Thank you, dear. - Natalie: A thing of beauty. - That looks good. [laughter] Uh, Dave... Yeah? Before we start, run in the other room and get my coat, will you? I got something in there for your mother. - Right now? - Yeah. Can't it wait? Well, it's something very special. Okay.
