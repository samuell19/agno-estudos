Apaches, sir. You're certain? My sidekick here is Cheyenne. If he says he seen Apaches, ain't likely he's describing no sunrise, sir. [TELEGRAPH CLICKING] It's Lordsburg, sir. It's urgent. [SCREAMING] The line's dead. Give me what you have. It's Apaches, all right. And it's Geronimo. He attacked a mining camp at Salt Creek. He killed 14 men and six women, and he's taking scalps. And Salt Creek is between here and Lordsburg. Lordsburg stage just came in. Warn the driver. Yes, sir. Whoa! For those of you folks that are going on, we're gonna be here in Tonto for exactly 30 minutes. You can get coffee in the hotel there, something more substantial in the saloon. For you gentlemen, private business is out back. Oh. Ma'am, if there's anything at all I can do for you? Thank you. I'll be all right. Uh, ma'am, if your time comes before we get where we're goin', I'm gonna have to charge that baby half fare. Is that supposed to be funny? Oh, uh-- No, ma'am. I've always been kind of known as a poor wit. I can vouch for it. So this is Tonto. Charming little mud puddle. If you're lookin' to save souls, preacher, here would be a dandy place to start. Preacher? No. Mother wanted me to be an actor. Father wanted me to go to hell. So I compromised. I became a whiskey salesman. "Trevor Peacock." Uh-huh. Uh, "Western Rep-- Representative, "Old John's Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey." Old John, smooth as a mother's kiss. Why don't you join me in the saloon? I'm just about to make my sales pitch. Two fingers of Old John will make this place seem like Chicago on a Saturday night. Uh... No, sir. No, sir. Worth more than my job to be caught with that on my breath. When we get to Lordsburg-- "When we get to Lordsburg." Magic words indeed. Young man, if the good Lord had meant us to travel by stagecoach, he'd have made the roads a little softer and our backsides a little larger. Hey, once you get that money to the bank, I want you to get back here, pronto. I'm on schedule, I'm gonna stay on schedule. Hey, would you watch it with them horses, now? BANKER: Here's your receipt. Thirty thousand dollars. Much obliged. I've asked you not to come here, Martha. Where were you last night, Henry? I waited until after midnight. There was just no way I could get away from my wife. When we first started seeing each other, that was never a problem. You aren't growing tired of me, are you? No, no, no, Martha. Not at all. Say that with a little more conviction, darling. A woman scorned can be messy. And a banker who's been bleeding his assets can't be too careful. What do you mean by that? A dozen accounts in eastern banks under a dozen names. That's what attracted me to you in the first place, Henry. Your imagination. Oh, by the way, have you told her? Have you told her yet that you're leaving her? No. You see there-- [CHUCKLES] There's just... been no time. I think the time is never right for a man to tell his wife the truth. I suppose that's why so often the job falls... to the mistress. [CHUCKLES] Oh, you sweet thing. Come here. Come here. You wouldn't dare do that, would you? Oh, but I would. What I won't do is grow old waiting...for a wife to die. [*] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PIANO PLAYING SOFT, SWEET MELODY] You're gonna miss me, Dallas. Sure. Sorry to see you go, Dallas. Thanks. Want to sit in, Dallas? Not likely, Hatfield. I'm here to sit on that stage, that's all I'm gonna sit on. One way to the end of the line. Lordsburg. Right. [COUGHING] Going bye-bye, Doc? Got business in another town, Dallas. Oh, it must be serious if you're wearing your iron. Well, a friend of mine in Tombstone said I should travel light and come well-balanced. Where are you going? I don't know. Far away. As far away from here as I can get. Yes, sir, you are talking to a lady in retirement. No more hot sheets and $5 on a chest of drawers. Oh, you must have found religion. Mm-mmm. I found love. Can you believe that? Oh, yes, sir, he talked about white picket fences, and rose bushes outside the kitchen window, and the... ...pitter-patter of little feet. And I can't fool, I bought it all. Every word. There was this problem. See, his wife already had all that. Stinking liar did me a favor, though. I realized once and for all no woman's gonna find a million-dollar dream in a $2 room. Most don't have a million dollar dream, Dallas. Doc, every woman's got a million dollar dream. She ain't never gonna find out where she might be if she don't get away from what she is. Think you'll find it on that stagecoach? I don't know. It's the only thing in my life: going someplace else. See you, Dallas. Tombstone. This stage is going to Lordsburg, mister. I know that. But you said-- I know what I said. I wanna go to Tombstone. But this isn't the Tombstone stage. Well, is there a stage that leaves Lordsburg going to Tombstone? Yeah. Is it possible to get on the stage to Lordsburg and get off of that stage and then go in to Tombstone on another stage? Is that possible? Oh, you wanna go to Tombstone by way of Lordsburg? Now you got it. There's a stage here tomorrow, goes directly to Tombstone. Well, which one gets there first? The one leaving today going to Lordsburg to Tombstone, or the one leaving tomorrow going directly to Tombstone? Well, that depends Lots of things can happen. Wheel fall off, axle break, horse-- But which one is supposed to get there first? The one through Lordsburg. That's the one I want. Why didn't you say so? That'll be 50 cents more. Thank you very... What I'm trying to tell you is, this is sneaking liquor you're selling. And I don't get many sneaking drinkers in here. My customers are mostly honest drunks. My dear friend, before you can pluck a turkey, the railroad is going to be coming through this-- This wilderness. And city folks are gonna demand something a little more refined for their taste than that bottled moonshine. Now, if you'll give me an order for just one case of Old John, I'll throw in a bottle for yourself free, gratis, and for nothing. But it's sneaking liquor. You wanna explain it to him, Doc? Sneakin' liquor? Well, it's sort of a social comment. It's liquor that little old ladies hide down in their petticoats and their corsets. And in books that you won't find in a Christian store. Hypocrite liquor. Nothing like a little bracer before prayer meeting. My dear friend, you can't compare Kentucky bourbon with the spirits old ladies hide in their knickers. But it's prescription. It's to help their nerves and to help 'em sleep. It's sneaking liquor, for medicinal purposes only. Doc knows what he's talking about. He's a dentist. Oh, really? Well, you may know your gums and teeth, sir, but I know my whiskey. The name's Trevor Peacock. May I have the honor of knowing to whom I'm talking? Holliday. Doc Holliday. Give me a shot of bourbon, Billy. [WHINNIES] This your stagecoach? I'm the driver. Why? Geronimo's between here and Lordsburg. It could get nasty. I never heard it tell it didn't get nasty when Geronimo is around. How come you tell me this like it was news? We're thinking about your passengers. Apaches cut the telegraph line. I suggest you lay over and wait. Wait for what? You guys ain't never caught Geronimo, and you ain't never gonna catch Geronimo. He's as much a part of this desert as the cactus and sunset shadows. Still, we thought you might have consideration for your passengers. Mister, I'm paid to take this stagecoach through. That's with or without passengers. They can listen to you cavalry men and sit here in town till doomsday if they want to, but this here stage is going through. Is that your final word? Yes, sir it is. No man can say a gun got put to his head to get him on an Overland stage. Now, I ain't heartless, but I got me a job to do, and I'm gonna do it with or without passengers. I ain't goin'. You ain't what? I ain't never met nobody who run across Geronimo and lived to talk about it. Walt, you wait just a second now. Look, Walt, I need you with me. You know that. I'll pay. I'll pay you double salary out of my own pocket. I never yet seen a dead man give a damn about money. Hey, Buck. Curly. How are you doing? I've been better. I lost my shotgun guard just now. I'm afraid I'm going to have to borrow one of your deputies for a run to Lordsburg. What happened to your guard? Oh, some cavalryman mentioned how Geronimo and his Apaches had cut down the telegraph wire. So my guard colored himself yellow and stepped down from his responsibilities. You got any coffee? On the stove. Thank you. Look, just because a man doesn't want to die doesn't mean he's yellow. Curly, you know as well as I do, when a man takes this job, he hires on to die. Goes with the territory. Well, I can't supply guards for the Overland Stage Company. Well, I can't go nowhere without one. I got passengers on that stage. One of them is a pregnant woman. Her family's got something to do with the cavalry. How pregnant? Do you ever thump a watermelon and get an echo back? She shouldn't be here. Well, she is here. Well, all my deputies are out looking for the Ringo Kid. Ringo Kid? Mm-hm. Last I heard Ringo Kid was in Yuma Prison. He broke out. My guess is he went looking for Luke Plummer, since it was Luke Plummer that killed his brother and the Plummers' testimony that put him away. Well, shoot, Curly, he's up in Lordsburg. I seen him there on my last run. You saw Luke Plummer? He and his brothers. Looked like a family reunion. That puts a different light on it. Yeah, I figured it might. I want Luke Plummer worse than I want the Ringo Kid. You got yourself a shotgun guard to Lordsburg. [PIANO PLAYING CHEERFUL MELODY] Your attention, please. May I have your attention? I address myself to those of you who are passengers on the Overland stage. y commanding officer has asked me to inform you, you travel at your own risk. Excuse me, what appears to be the difficulty, lieutenant? To put it simply: Geronimo. I have a group of cavalry to accompany you. Excuse me, should I know this...Geraldo? Geronimo. I have a detachment of cavalry to accompany you as far as the noon station at Dry Forks. A group of cavalry there will take you on to Apache Wells. From Apache Wells, you'll have another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg. But our best advice is don't go. Are there any questions? I have one. Yes? Did he show you his title? What? Geronimo. He and his people own title to all this land around here. At least they think they do, they've been here for a thousand years. Whose side are you on? I'm on my own side. That's why I'm still alive. You'll excuse me, sir, but you sound like an Indian lover. You'll excuse me, but I see no virtue in hating a man who's fighting for his country. I myself have no quarrel with this, uh... Geronimo. I don't either, but he don't care. Excuse me. Aren't you Colonel Armstrong's daughter, Lucy? Colonel James Armstrong from Fairfax, Virginia? I am. I served under your father, Mrs... Mallory. Captain John Mallory. Perhaps you know him? LIEUTENANT: I know him well. He's expecting me at Apache Wells. He's a lot closer than that. He was posted at Dry Forks last month. But in light of what I've said, I don't really think it's advisable to continue on. Perhaps not. But I intend to be with my husband when our child is born. I understand, but-- I'm going, lieutenant. I appreciate your concern, but I'm going. As you say, Mrs. Mallory. Where you going? I'm out. Hoss, you got our money. You gonna give us a chance to win it back? Now, when you men came in here you surely didn't believe that you was in some Boston gentlemen's club. I'm a gambler. I play for money, and I don't give it back. Now you boys can understand that, can't you? Here. Mallory? Do I know you? No, but I knew your father. May I sit down? My name's Hatfield. I was paymaster in your father's regiment. You know, he actually saved my life. You know if you responded in some way, we might actually call this a conversation. It would also signify that I was interested in conversing with you, Mr. Hatfield. Well, excuse me, Mrs. Mallory. I didn't know that pregnancy was an excuse for rudeness. Mr. Hatfield. Forgive me, I-- I'm not myself. I haven't been myself since I left Virginia. Please sit down. Are you gonna be all right? You know, if you don't mind me saying so, Arizona's not the best place in the world to give birth to a baby. I don't think my husband has thought about a baby. What he wants is a horse soldier in the United States Cavalry. Fully outfitted, powder dry, and ready to ride. Well, then maybe you have come to the right place, after all. Thank you, Mr. Hatfield. You've been awfully considerate. Well, I intend to stay with you until you reach your husband. That really won't be necessary. Oh, but I'm afraid you have no choice. You see, it's between me and your father. Here you go, ma'am. Sir. You can just throw that up on top. Don't worry about it, ma'am. I won't break nothing. Honey, how you gonna break a silk dress? Hallie! Cybil! Now what in the devil does he want? Hello. Whoa! I need to go to Lordsburg. You couldn't have got on in town with everybody else? Well, I got a telegram. There was no way to pack and get there on time. Well, all right, hop on in. You can pay me when you get there. Here, I'll take that bag. Hm? Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. I'll just keep the bag with me. Thank you. I thought you said the telegraph line was cut. You caught that too, huh? Come on! Does anybody know why this stage has a Cavalry escort? The Cavalry's here for our manifest destiny. Our what? To protect us from the Indians. You may have noticed that we white people take what we want without regard to what the present owner might think. Some people could call that "stealing." We call it "manifest destiny." You know, I'd hate to think you're calling us thieves. What else? We come with a gun in one hand, a jug in the other. We weaken 'em with the jug and finish 'em off with the gun. All I asked is why we have a Cavalry escort. I didn't ask for a sermon. Well, if you wanted one word, that one word is Geronimo. That Apache butcher? That Geronimo? In the whole wide world, there's only one. Do you suppose he loves his kids and does charity work? Yes, and he's kind to small animals. I've heard that. BUCK: Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Take this a minute, will you? Yeah, sure. You know, don't you, that if Geronimo decides to get serious, 10 or 12 soldiers don't mean nothing? Yeah, I try not to think about it. You don't mind if I do, do you? What's that? Think about it. No, you go right ahead. Well, they say that God protects fools and drunks. We got the biggest fool in the whole Southwest territory riding right here on this coach. Who, besides me? Well, me. Do you know anybody else that'd drive a six-horse team through hostile Apache territory for $8 a month? ["STAGECOACH" THEME PLAYING] LIEUTENANT: Water your horses. [HORSE WHINNIES] [*] I didn't know it was gonna be this easy, Ringo. Drop the Winchester. I only half-figured on the stagecoach, Curly. I didn't figure on you at all. Drop the rifle, Kid. I'm giving you a free ride into Lordsburg jail, and I'll take care of the Plummers. I get paid for it, you don't. Now, hand over the rifle. You got some mighty heavy backup, Curly. What do they cost you by the hour? Do I have to ask what's going on here? Yeah, I told this man to hand over his rifle, and he's still got it. I guess he never saw what double-ought buck can do to a $2 shirt. Are you placing this man under arrest? I certainly hope so, because it's a bad place for a funeral. There's not a choir nor a flower within three hundred miles. Now, what's it gonna be, Ringo? And the pistol. The pig sticker. CURLY: I said the pig sticker, Ringo. Do I get to ride on the coach, or do you want me to run along up front so you can keep an eye on me? You shut your smart mouth and get inside. BUCK: Hyah! Excuse me. So you're the Ringo Kid. No, sir. What do you mean, "No, sir"? I heard the marshal say that you are-- Ringo Kid's somebody you read about in the penny dreadfuls. Somebody thought him up so they could sell stories to people dumb enough to believe 'em. All right. If you aren't the Ringo Kid, then who are you? My name's Bill Williams, but they call me "Ringo" since I was a little boy. But nobody ever called me "The Ringo Kid." You wouldn't be Williams from Santa Fe, would you? I would. You got a brother named Coy? I had a brother named Coy. I played poker with him. Whatever became of him? He was murdered. I'm sorry. Not as sorry as the man's gonna be who murdered him. Who might that be? His name is Luke Plummer. He's in Lordsburg. Ever kill a man before, Mr. Williams? Not yet. I didn't catch your name. Well, his name is Doc Holliday. Is that right? I heard you were pretty handy with a gun. I'm still alive. Is that the deck you play with? One of them. I have several. May I see it, please? I must say I admire your guts. Does that mean you wouldn't play cards with me? That means I'd shoot you on sight. [CHUCKLES] [*] Where are you headed? I knew the answer to that when I was about 14. Then I hit 15, ran head-on into that thing called reality. Been walking with a lantern ever since. I mean where are you going now? I don't know, where you go when you've been everywhere? Nobody's been everywhere. Maybe you're right. It just feels like it. Where do you wanna go? I don't think I've ever seen it on a map. Don't light that. Did you say something? A gentlemen doesn't smoke in the presence of a lady. I wouldn't like to think you're implying that I'm anything less. I may be, you understand, I just wouldn't wanna hear you say it. Do you mind if I smoke, Dallas? Hell, no, Doc. Smoke's been one of the biggest parts of my life, I wouldn't know what to do with fresh air. Breathe it or bottle it. And you, ma'am. Do you object? If you want to smoke, Doctor, it's perfectly all right with me. Although I may have things to complain about tobacco is not one of them. In that case. Thank you. What are you looking at, friend? It's a filthy habit, smoking. Just filthy. I have a lot of filthy habits. Most I find very enjoyable. Don't you have good ones? You mean something to be admired and held up to children as an example? Yes. Something like that. No, sir. Children despise that kind of person. There's nothing a child hates more than a good example. Curly, you ain't said a word in over 20 miles. I was thinking about that banker running down the street like that. Well, how else is he supposed to stop the stage? That ain't the point. It's almost like somebody was after him. If that were the case, he'd probably said something to you, don't you think? He was carrying nothing but that black bag. And why did he lie about getting a telegraph wire? I don't know. It's just that when a banker runs out in the street and jumps on a stage leaving town without so much as change of clothes... MAN: Hyah! [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Hyah! Ma? Ma, the stage is coming. Well, they're gonna have to be satisfied with venison. I'm all out of beans. There's soldiers with them. Nothing in my contract says I got to feed the army. Hyah! Hyah! Come on! Hyah! BUCK: Whoa! Billy, where's our soldier escort into Apache Wells? Gone, all gone. Had to light out pretty quick. Well, who the devil is here? Just me, Ma, and the hostlers. I should've known not to volunteer for anything. Well, you did. It's too late. MRS. MALLORY: Captain Mallory isn't here? No, ma'am. He was here, but he was ordered off to Apache Wells. Are you Mrs. Mallory? Yes. I-I was expecting him. I was counting on it. Ma'am, you can't count on nothing out here. BUCK: All right. We're gonna change teams here, folks. So I suggest you go inside. Mrs. Pickett's got some food on the table. Thank you. And you got 30 minutes, so make it quick, all right? Well, what's it gonna be, lieutenant? You and your boys gonna take us on to Apache Wells? I'm afraid not. My orders were Dry Forks and return. GATEWOOD: I'm sure, under the circumstances, your commanding officer will understand. He might, but there's no way to reach him. I can't just change my orders. You can't send us out there alone with them Indians. I'm not sending you anywhere. Lieutenant, it seems to me there could come a time when common sense would override army orders. Common sense has never overridden army orders. When our horses are watered and rested, we return directly to Tonto. I strongly suggest you use common sense and return with us. He's right, you know. Well, the passengers can go back to Tonto with them if they want to. But I started on this trip on the way to Lordsburg, and I'm gonna get to Lordsburg, even if it's just me and one horse that drags into town. How about you, Mr. Gatewood? Want to drag into Lordsburg with Buck and one horse? I'm certain it will never come to that. But yes. I stay. [SIGHS] Hi. Hello. It looks like we're eating all alone, Kid. It's me they don't wanna sit down with. No, it ain't. It's nice of you to say so, but I'm accustomed to it. I've known men who bare their souls and everything else before midnight. They don't know my name the next morning. And you're accustomed to it? Being accustomed to something don't mean you like it. I guess you've seen all kinds. Every kind, but me. Well, that makes you pretty special. If I am, I'm the only one that knows it. Where you from? Virginia. You must be a tough little lady. If there's anything at all I can do for you, you let me know. Thank you. [BIRDS CHIRPING, CHICKENS CLUCKING] [*] What's a handsome lady like you doing in a pigpen like this? When I married, my husband promised me adventure and colorful surroundings, and this is it. Where's he at now? He never made it through the first winter. Well, there's another winter coming on. You got any plans? [COUGHING] Think you can make it to spring? Ah, I don't think so. What's wrong with him? Consumption. Did you eat? I ate a lot when I was a kid. [CHUCKLES] [METAL JINGLING] [*] You're scared. Nah. You? Yeah. Yeah, me too. Tell you the honest truth, Curly, I'm always semi-scared, even without Geronimo. That never stopped you before. Nah. I think if I wasn't a little bit scared, I'd probably quit. The job would be too boring, you know, like, uh... taking kids back and forth to church. What do you think the passengers are gonna do? Besides Gatewood, I mean. He's really scared, but he's scared of something worse than the Apaches. Well, I don't know. If you was a passenger, how would you vote? I am a passenger, and I'm going. Even without soldiers? Buck, you know as well as I do that if Geronimo decides to get serious, he can run through 12 horse soldiers like grain through a goose. Yeah, but you're forgetting one thing, Curly. I got a pregnant woman on that stage and she's about to pop. Won't be the first white baby born between a cactus and a prairie-dog hole. First one born on my stagecoach. But you got a doctor onboard this time. Doc Holliday? If he's the only one you got, he's the best you got. Doc Holliday's a dentist. I don't know many women who'd wanna have their babies delivered by a dentist. I don't know any. I'm glad you're telling him, not me. He's your passenger. Yeah, but you're the U.S. Marshal. You got more authority than I do. I think you're afraid to tell him. I ain't afraid to tell nobody nothing. I don't see you trying to be no hero, busting down no doors. I ain't afraid of Doc Holliday. Well, I ain't either. Well, it don't take a hero to tell him he's gotta deliver a baby. What does it take? Two men. Curly Wilcox, are you saying that you want me to be with you when you tell him? Want has got nothing to do with it. I am the U.S. Marshal. You're gonna be with me, and we're gonna tell him. [SIGHS] Listen up, everybody. We don't have a Cavalry escort to Apache Wells like we thought we did. The soldiers that came this far with us are going back. We either go back with them, or we go ahead. It's up to you. Where do you stand? I move that we make the run to Apache Wells. From there we have a cavalry escort to Lordsburg. Where I go, you go, Kid, so that makes two. How about you, Doc? Dallas? Oh, I'm in. Um, marshal, y-you understand I'm not concerned for myself, but I would hate to see good whiskey wasted on Geronimo. I must insist we return to Tonto. Sorry, mister, in this court, majority rules. That means, if there is three people and two of them vote to die, the third one has to die with them. Under the circumstances, I think the lady has two votes. My life is where my husband is. I have every reason to go ahead, and no reason to go back. Does that mean we go ahead? Yes, sir. I'm with Mrs. Mallory. [QUIETLY] Thank you. Well, I've made my case clear. I boarded this stage to go to Lordsburg, and I see no reason to return. You don't? Mm-mm. There's a band of wild savages out there waiting to separate us from our hair, and you see no reason to turn back? Majority has it, mister. We go ahead. If you know your history, marshal, you'll remember that majority decisions have not always been the smartest ones. I don't know much about history, mister, but I do know if we'd listened to you British, we wouldn't have any history at all. [LAUGHS] Touché, marshal. Touché. Billy, you got a spare horse you can loan this man? Well, I could if I thought I'd ever get it back, but under the circumstances, uh, I'd sell it to him. There you go, mister. Billy will sell you a horse, and you can go back with the soldiers. And if we're wrong, you'll have the satisfaction that comes with knowing you were right. Thank you. I shall see that your widow receives a complimentary case of Old John. Meanwhile, we have five men that can shoot. A driver with six running horses. Okay? Load them up. Mr. Gatewood? Yes? Any reason that bag can't ride on top? Well, I'm carrying valuable bank paper. The stage has a strongbox. Well, I just can't let it out of my sight. Don't you think you ought to give me back my Winchester? Now, why would I think that? Well, I'm a pretty good shot. That's why I think giving it back is the poorest idea I ever heard of. Did you think it up all by yourself? Don't tell me you believe all those stories you heard about me. I heard you were in Yuma Prison, and I heard you broke out. And I know it ain't idle gossip because you're standing here talking to me. You really gonna let me go through Apache country naked? If I see one Apache, I'll give you back your Winchester to hide behind. Well, you probably won't see him. And if you do, he'll probably have all his uncles and his cousins and his brothers with him. If he does, I'll probably beg you to take back your Winchester. Probably. Hey, Buck. Miss Pickett. Hey, Doc. You know anything about babies? About what? Babies. You know, little...babies. Yeah, the kind that women have. Well, I think I know how they're made, and I've heard rumors about where they come from. And I believe they grow up to be people. That's all you know? I know they're messy, and they make a lot of noise. What else? Well, I wouldn't play poker with one, and I wouldn't have one in the house. Oh, come on, Doc, we're serious. You don't see me smiling. Look, a doctor is supposed to be both responsible and helpful. Would you gentlemen come to the point? Okay, I'll come to the point. Can you deliver a baby? No, sir. Well, a woman does all the work. Unless she gets in some kind of trouble. That's right. And if-if she was to get herself into some kind of trouble, now, she'd be real good off if she had a doctor around, wouldn't she? Wouldn't be a bad idea. You're it. I'm what? It. If Mrs. Mallory gets into trouble, I'm sure you'll be helpful and responsible. Well, I've done everything else for a woman. He didn't say he's gonna do it. He didn't say he wouldn't. Much obliged, Miss Pickett. [*] Hyah! I wish I was going somewhere on that stage. Why? It was a stage that brought us here. I don't care. I just wish I was goin'. [*] BUCK: Peaceful, ain't it? CURLY: I'm not admiring the scenery. Well, you ain't gonna see no Apaches looking forward. What they like to do is let you pass, then they let you have it. I know. Treat you kind of like you was a buffalo: sneak up from your backside. I know that. While I'm thinking about it, that shotgun of yours ain't gonna do no good. It's only good for close-up work. Why do you keep telling me things I know? What you wanna get a hold of is something where you can shoot 'em as far away as the next territory. Anything else you wanna tell me that I already know? Curly, I got me two rifles right underneath that seating area. You always keep two rifles under the seat? Yes, sir. My wife cleans 'em and loads 'em for me. Now, a lot of men get fried chicken. You got a good wife. Yeah, I know it. She used to ride shotgun for me. Then she said it got, uh... Got too hard on her ovaries. What's an ovary? Well, near as I can tell, it's, uh... you know, part of her machinery. Sight of blood bother you much? Only if it's mine. Why? Well, because there ain't no way we're gonna get clean through to Lordsburg without getting into a fight of some kind. You can take my word for that. Mind looking somewhere else for a while? I hear you're good at robbing banks, is that right? I wouldn't know. I never robbed a bank. Oh. Oh, I see. And where do you suppose I got the idea that's what you do for a living? Probably one of them books you read. Well, what do you do? I mind my own business. You ought to try it sometime. Why? It's not near as dangerous as the way you're living now. [*] How do you feel, Mrs. Mallory? How do I feel? I mean, you got any...twinges or unexplained discomforts, or anything like that? I have a great many discomforts, doctor. I'm sure that they can all be explained. Well, you see, I'm only asking in a professional capacity. You're not Mrs. Mallory's kind of doctor. I know that. But she doesn't have a lot to choose from, now does she, Hatfield? Well, I don't know about Mrs. Mallory, but under the lady's circumstances, I'd be real happy to see any doctor I could get. And that's me. [*] You said you were the paymaster in my father's regiment? Yeah. I was the most popular man in the Army... once a month. How did he save your life? Well, they were gonna hang me. Who was gonna hang you? My fellow soldiers. You know, I never felt I belonged in the Army anyway. Never could respond to bugle calls. It's a hateful thing, a bugle call. Now, I wake up when I want to, and I go to sleep when I want to, and I sure don't need a bugle to tell me when. But why were they going to hang you? I lost the payroll. You misplaced it? You know, they used a lot of words, but I don't think "misplaced" was one of them. I'm sorry, I don't understand. You see, I lost the payroll in a game of seven-card stud. The more I lost, the more certain I was I was gonna win, until finally there wasn't nothing left. You gambled away the regimental payroll? Don't make it sound so easy. It took me 17 hours. You know, I believe that was the hardest work I ever did, the coldest deck I ever saw, and the biggest mistake I ever made. I didn't believe it was possible for a man to play poker for 17 hours, and never hold a face card. I don't know anything about gambling. I didn't either. But your father saved me from hanging. He had me court-martialed, and I spent two years at hard labor. But when I came out of prison I knew how to crimp, mark, deal from the bottom and double-deal. And I haven't worked a day since. Are you saying that you win by dishonest means? No, ma'am. I win by any means. [*] Whoa! How long ago? Less than an hour. We were told there'd be soldiers here. Well, there was, but not enough. Where'd they go? The detail took the wounded back to Lordsburg. The rest is out chasing. Might as well have all went back for all the good it'll do. Is a Captain Mallory here? Who are you? This is Mrs. Mallory. She was told she'd find her husband here. He's a captain in the cavalry. Ma'am, you shouldn't be here. I am here. The question was, where is my husband? They took him back to Lordsburg. Took? Did you say "took"? Yes, ma'am. Is he wounded, or is he dead? He's wounded. How badly? Not as bad as it could be. That tells me precisely nothing. He's alive. That's all I can tell you, that's all I know. Now, ma'am, there's only one bed in this station, and it's got your name writ all over it. If I was you, I'd take to it. I'll try and find you some blankets. Where's Buck's fresh team? Where's the hostlers? Your team was the first thing the Indians took. My help went south. You're gonna have to let this team rest and use them again tomorrow. If you make it to Lordsburg, you tell them I'm closing this station. I'd say the Apaches closed it for you. [*] You know, they say Geronimo has two virtues: He can kill without being killed, and steal without getting caught. Those don't sound like virtues to me. Well, it would if you were an Apache with a white man coming out from under every rock. You know, you actually sound like you admire him. I do. I admire anybody that'll fight for their survival against odds that they know is gonna overwhelm them in the end. [GASPS] Mrs. Mallory, you better sit down. You look tired. Please, let me help you. Where's that bed? It's there. Careful, easy now. All right. I envy you. Why? Why? Why do you envy me? You fixing to give birth to a new best friend. I never thought about it like that. Well, I think that's the only way to think about it if you're gonna have a baby. And make no mistake about it, you are gonna have a baby. Here you go. Right here. Good girl. Good girl. I think that's the only way to think about it. I mean, you give it life. You teach it to walk and to eat and to take care of itself. And then, when it hurts, you hold it. When it feels good, you laugh with it. And wherever you live, that's its home too. Until it grows up and leaves you. No, ma'am. Wherever you live is that baby's home, forever and forever. Have you ever been married? I gave that thought my last shot in that town back yonder. But the gentleman was a liar, but beautiful. He painted these magnificent pictures with these empty words, but you wouldn't know nothing about that. Pretty fan. Isn't that pretty? I love it. Belonged to my mama. Oh, Miss Mallory, I was brought up to be a lady. Just kind of sad, all the things that happened along the way. Where are you going? I don't even care anymore. Maybe that's the saddest part. Not caring. [GASPS] Oh! All right, all right. Relax. Relax. Thank you. Head up-- I think it's coming. It's all right. Don't you worry. It's gonna be fine. Get that doctor. Mm. What if something goes wrong? Darling, don't you worry. I'm here. Do you know about such things? A little bit. And that'll be plenty. [*] [COYOTES HOWLING] DALLAS: Doc, Miss Mallory wants you. Doc, Mrs. Mallory wants you. We're almost to Lordsburg. Can't she wait? It's the baby that's not waiting. That's how it is with babies. They want what they want, when they want it. [COYOTE HOWLING] [OWL HOOTING] [COYOTE HOWLING, OWL HOOTING] DALLAS: What about your hands? What about 'em? Ain't you gonna wash your hands? The baby won't know the difference. What about Mrs. Mallory? You think she wants your fingerprints all over everything when she sees her husband? [SIGHS] Your hands, doc. [COYOTES HOWLING] Anything else? Yes, don't slap the baby. Okay. Why would I slap the baby? I don't know, but most doctors do. It's a custom I'm not in favor of. Nobody comes into this world looking for a fight. You go get her. [GASPS] Dallas tells me your time is near. I think my time is here, doctor. [GROANS] [GASPING] Those...twinges you told me about, are considerably more than twinges. Well, I'm sorry about my choice of words there, but I've never really done this before. You've never delivered a baby? No, ma'am. Not even one. But-- But everyone calls you "doc." Yes, ma'am. There's something else I should tell you too, and I realize this is not the best time to do it... but I'm not a doctor. I'm a dentist. A dentist? Yes, ma'am. [GASPING] It's all right. Just relax. It's okay, Mrs. Mallory. It's okay. Just lay down. Relax. It's okay. Just relax. It's gonna be all right. [MUTTERS SOFTLY] A dentist? Yes, ma'am. Do you know anything at all about what is gonna happen here tonight? Oh, yes, ma'am. A lot of good things are gonna happen here tonight, great things. You can count on that. You know, one time I delivered a foal for my mare. Prettiest little filly you ever saw. Filly? Really. [OWL HOOTING] Can I help? No. [*] But you can ask your question. I mean, I've been looked at by a lot of men. I don't have to ask. I know what the look means. You said something that stuck in my head. You said you'd met every kind, but you. Yeah, so? What kind are you? I never met one of a kind before. If you had, you think it'd have changed your life any? Might have. One of a kind and one of a kind make a pair of a kind. Cowboy... if we knew each other at all, which we don't, I have to call that about the worst proposal I ever heard. Proposal? Well, what am I supposed to think, you talking about us as a pair and--? Well, I didn't say a pair of what. That's true. You didn't. You keep the thought. I like long running stories. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SPURS JINGLING, GRAVEL CRUNCHING] It looks peaceful in the moonlight, don't it? Hm. You don't expect the Apaches to come back here tonight, do you? Wouldn't surprise me. Nothing the Apaches do surprises me. It shocks me sometimes, but the shock's never a surprise. Did you ever know an Apache? Never did. Me neither. They're not much for hanging around forts. They burn 'em down, but they don't hang around 'em. Listen, Curly, tell me one thing: Why are you taking me back in? That's quite a question for an escaped convict to be asking a lawman. It's not me that wants you, Ringo, it's the law. You see, they seem to have some opinion that if you murder a member of society, that you owe society something. I didn't murder anybody. His name was Dan Curtis. He was the Plummers' foreman. I was at my ranch across the border the night he was killed. Not according to Luke Plummer and his brothers, and it was their testimony that put you in Yuma Prison-- They lied. I think you said that at the trial. And you're gonna have another chance to debate that with them back in Yuma. What do you mean? I'm going into Lordsburg to satisfy a wanted poster. Three of 'em robbed a bank in Santa Fe. Killed a teller and two innocent bystanders. And you're going into Lordsburg all by yourself to take on all the Plummers? That's what you were gonna do, ain't it? Well, you're gonna need some help. If I deputized an escaped convict, I'd be run out of the territory. It's better than being carried out. [SPURS JINGLING, GRAVEL CRUNCHING] [COYOTE HOWLS] Is the team gonna be ready? Yeah, they got to be ready, the only one we got. You think we'll see the Apaches between here and Lordsburg? I think they know the schedule better than the front office. Wonder why they haven't hit us already. Ah, you know the Apache. Probably sitting around thinking about it. I believe sometimes thinking about it is better than doing it. Did you ever know an Apache? No. I never did. I think I'll go on inside. You want somebody to relieve you? No. What I really want is a look in that banker's bag. Keeps that dang thing closer to him than his belt buckle. That's why I want to look in it. The bag. [COYOTE HOWLING] DALLAS: What's the matter, Kid? You can't sleep? I thought you were with the lady. She don't need me now. It gives me time to think about what you could have meant. A pair, you said. Hm? A pair of what? You told me you didn't know where you're going. Oh, does anybody? I do. Hm. As soon as I take care of some business in Lordsburg... me and my brother were building our little ranch over in Mexico, about four miles from the border. But then your brother got killed? But my brother got murdered. And that's what I have to take care of in Lordsburg. Keep talkin'. Well, this little ranch is the prettiest place you ever saw. Plenty of water. Grass and cottonwood trees around the house. Mm-hm. Lots of rosebushes, I bet? Never seen a rosebush. Listen, uh... what I thought was, well, since you don't know where you're going, I thought you might like to take a look at it. And if I liked it, I could just stay and live there? If you like it. And we could just live happily ever after? No, just live together and take what comes, like everybody else. What's the matter with you, Kid, don't you believe in fairy tales? I live in a real world, Dallas. Just like you do. Uh-uh. You don't know anything about me. You don't know one thing about me. I know everything about you. You're the woman my mama warned me about. Well, I can't say I know anything about a man until he kisses me. [GASPING] DOC: You're doing real good, Miss Mallory. Doing real good. You couldn't be doing no better if you was in one of 'em fine bedrooms with a brace of nurses and one of them $50-a-day doctors. [GROANING] Miss Mallory, I gotta look now. Look? If that baby don't come out straight and head first, we could have a real problem. It's gonna be all right, but I do have to look. Do you mean, look? Yes, ma'am. [MOANS] You gotta help me. You gotta turn over, if you will. Would you put out your cigar first, please? Now then, you gotta turn over on your back. [MOANING] Not too fast. [PANTING] Spread your legs just as far as you can. I am never gonna be embarrassed again. Look what I found. [SNIFFS] You want a slug of this? Nope. I don't drink. You don't like whiskey? I like it, all right. I like it too much. That's the reason I don't drink it. I always wanted to meet a man of character. Character has nothing to do with it. I'm a gambler. Yeah, I guess whiskey and gambling is poor mix, ain't it? Whiskey and anything is a poor mix. You ought to be a preacher. The day when I can't find an ace in a haystack, I might just do that. Here, shuffle and spread 'em. What hand do you favor? A flush or a straight? Maybe a full house. I'm partial to a straight. So am I. [SIGHS] You're missing the ace. Hmm. I always save the best for last. You ever been caught? The day when I'm caught, then I'll start preaching. Because nobody can save souls better than a man that's lost his own. Amen. [BABY CRYING] It's here. He did it. She did it. Here you are, Mrs. Mallory. So this is what you look like. I've been wondering for nine months. I wanted you to look like your father. She looks exactly like you. She? Yes, ma'am, she. For a job well done, sir. Thank you, nurse. My husband wanted a boy. Why? I don't know. He-- He just always talked about a boy. He's gonna take what he gets, and he'll like it. Honey, men don't know what they want till you give it to them. Then, when they get it, it's exactly what they've always wanted. [GURGLING] Oh. Miss Mallory wanted me to introduce her daughter, so don't nobody cut and run. RINGO: Oh, look at that. Oh. DALLAS: I think this little girl's had just about as many shocks as a lady can take for one evening, so she's gonna say goodnight now. RINGO: Hmm, she is. Good night. Whew. That looked just like a baby. Hmm. If you get back to Lordsburg, don't forget to tell them this station's closed. Ain't gonna be nobody here. Well, where are you going? I'd give worlds to know, but not knowing's a whole heap better than hanging around here, getting butchered to move on a stage company. Well, Chris, we're going on to Lordsburg. You're more than welcome to join us if you want to. You ain't never gonna see Lordsburg. [SIGHS] Yeah. There are some who say we don't have a chance to make it to Lordsburg. What we don't have is a choice. There'll be rifles up on top for everybody. Hatfield? I work better with this. Mr. Gatewood, how would you feel about giving up that bag for a rifle? Give it up? Well, I don't quite know what do you mean when you say "give it up." Store it up on top. You can have it back when we get to Lordsburg. You keep insisting on that, but I've already told you that I won't do it. Besides, I...can't shoot. I've never handled a rifle in my life. Best time to learn is when it might be your last chance. If what you got in that bag is more important to you than your life, then you got a right to hold on to it. But we got two women and a baby onboard. Hmm. That don't move you? They're not my responsibility. Doc? You finally come to me. You're the prettiest, so I saved you for last. Since these are yours, I imagine you know how to use them. I imagine. All right, let's load up. Curly, what about Mrs. Mallory? Yeah, Doc, I know she had a baby, and she shouldn't travel. Thought about that. But how is she? Well, she's all right. How's the baby? Baby's fine. You know we can't leave 'em here. No, sir. You get the women. CURLY: All set? BUCK: Yeah. Folks, there's a couple of things you ought to know. Ride to Lordsburg is 30 miles. We'll be going as slow as we can for as long as we can. These horses are the same ones that brought us here and they're plumb wore out. If there's trouble, you men know what to do. Take your time, squeeze off your shots, make every shot count. What are the chances of not seeing any Indians? Mr. Hatfield's better qualified to give you the odds than I am, ma'am. Well, if anyone asked me, I'd say our chances are good. I'd sooner draw to an inside straight myself. [*] [HORSE WHINNIES] BUCK: Hyah! Come on. Come on! Eight dollars a month. I told them it wasn't enough. They told me they could get somebody else to do it a lot cheaper than that. Hey. Hmm? [KNOCKS ON ROOF] Look sharp. [CRYING] Faster. Not yet. [BABY WAILING] CURLY: Hold your fire. Wait till they're closer. [BABY CONTINUES WAILING] Now. Hyah! BUCK: Come on! [CRYING] Hyah! Hyah! [GROANS] Curly, get the lines. CURLY: I'll get 'em. [YELLS] Curly! Ringo, get Curly. [BABY CRYING] [PLAYING "CHARGE"] [APACHES SHOUTING] [GURGLING] CURLY: You know I gotta go with Ringo. Yeah, I figured you would. I can't say I enjoyed the trip, but I know what you mean, $8 dollars a month ain't enough. Tell 'em for me, would you? They should at least make it nine. You hurting? Nah. You? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, me too. Buck. Marshal. That's probably good as I can do with what they got to work with, Curly. Yeah, I guess so. Goodbye, Mrs. Mallory. Goodbye, marshal. When she grows up, she's gonna be asking questions about where she was born and everything. I suppose. You gonna tell her the truth? Of course. Every girl needs something to live up to. And every lady needs something to remember. Oh, Dallas. Thank you, Doc. Miss Mallory. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Mr. Hatfield, you can consider your debt to my father paid. It's been a long time owing, Mrs. Mallory. CAPT. MALLORY: Is the dead man's name Gatewood? Yeah, he's the banker from Tonto. Why? He robbed his own bank. You don't seem surprised. Captain, when a banker runs out and flags down a stage leaving town without so much as a change of underwear, nothing he's gonna do surprises me. What about the money? Turn it over to the sheriff in Lordsburg. There's no civilian law in Lordsburg. None? Marshal, if you go into Lordsburg, you're the only civilian law there. [*] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PIANO PLAYING PEACEFUL MELODY] Mr. Plummer, could I talk to you? Go away. Luke don't talk when he's playing cards. Ringo's in town. Ringo's in prison. Not no more. Uh-uh. He just come into town, drivin' the stage. Marshal from Tonto beside him. You trying to tell me he came into Lordsburg with the law? I'm telling you what I seen, l-like you told me to. How's your arm? Worthless. Can you manage? I'll manage. [*] [SIGHS] Stay here. I won't be long. That was a nice thought. One of a kind, one of a kind making a pair and all. It was nice. You gonna be here when I get back? What makes you think you're coming back? You. Too bad you're still worried about getting run out of the territory. I ain't worried about that anymore. I'm deputizing you. I'm trying to figure out how we're gonna do it. Luke Plummer's got a saloon full of brothers. Since you don't look like you're up to nothing fancy, I suspect I'm gonna be pretty busy. We can probably take a little pressure off. Huh, Mr. Hatfield? Your flanks will be covered. I can't use this. You might need it. And since I'm the U.S. marshal, I'm gonna tell them they're under arrest. [PIANO PLAYING PLEASANT MELODY] Would you gentlemen care for another drink? CURLY: Whiskey. Your last drink, Mr. Plummer. Try to enjoy it. [PIANO STOPS PLAYING, CHATTERING SILENCES] I reckon that's supposed to mean something? These must be your brothers and your gang. Nice to have family with you when you die. Well, if you're interested in writing my family history, I reckon you should get in touch with my old man. He's mostly to do about it. If these are your brothers, you're all three under arrest for bank robbery and murder. That's a mighty fancy speech for a one-armed marshal with no gun. My gun is on loan to Bill Williams at the moment. You might know him better as the Ringo Kid. Yeah, we heard a tale he was out of prison. Took a job driving a stage. How'd they found out he didn't do it? They don't. You just told me. Now either give up your guns or take your chances outside. Ringo's out there? Ringo's my deputy. A fine, upstanding young man, shoots straight, sings in the choir. LUKE: You with us on this? The way I see it, Luke, it's not my fight, yet. Bartender, keep this whiskey waiting. I'll finish it when I get back. [*] Drop that gun, or you'll never have another toothache. Move. Now, what you're planning is not nice. Let me hold that for you. Chilly night out tonight, ain't it? Yeah, I think it's fixing to get hot. Don't have to be this way, you know. Let's say I'm doing this for my brother Coy. The marshal tell you you're under arrest? He might have mentioned it. You're not sure, though? Well, now... I never really paid much attention to what the law had to say. LUKE: Did hear tell, though, you're his deputy. Yeah, well, good help's hard to find. Now you lift your gun and drop it. Sure. Anything you say. [GUNSHOT] [*] [CROWD MURMURING] [EXHALES] I don't reckon either one of you brothers wanna say a few words about how badly he was abused and mistreated in this life but is gonna get his reward in the next. Mr. Hatfield, marry them to the post until I'm ready to go. HATFIELD: Get over there. Get over there. Grab that post. CURLY: Doc, you can ask Ringo to come in. If they move, shoot them. [CHUCKLES] It don't look like Ringo wants to come back inside. CURLY: Where do you think you're going, Ringo? Me and my partner got some business across the border. I deputized you and the job ain't done yet. Wasn't much of a job, Curly. I don't know. A man breaks out of prison one day, and gets deputized the next? I'd call that a pretty good job. Too regular. Luke Plummer cleared you. As far as I'm concerned, you're on the right side of the law. Except for those horses you're stealing. These horses been stole so many times they can't give their own right names anymore. You sure you're doing the right thing? I'm doing like you, Doc. Traveling light, coming well-balanced. [*] You know, a woman could do a lot worse, Curly. What? Running off with Ringo? No. Traveling light and coming well-balanced. [WILLIE NELSON'S "STAGECOACH" PLAYING]
