[dramatic music] [engines revving] [lighter flicks] [engine revving] [tires squealing] [engines revving] - [Man On PA] And they're piled up going by the grand stands. They're looking for daylight as they head into the first turn. Stevens and Wallace have been playing tag all day. Stewert, Stevens, Rusty Wallace, Ricky Irvin, Petty. Down in the winner's circle we've got Micky Stewert and Tommy Gleason. This is their first victory for the two. They've come up quick through the ranks. Working through the amateur ranks and now on the pro league. They've shown a great team today and a great victory. Between them they've driven great. We look forward to a long career from this young man. [sniffing] And we've got a green flag as another Daytona 500 is under way. 63 cars, all looking to be winners. Pulls out into the lead. 16 going up against the wall. Micky Stewert holding onto that lead. Watch out! We've got a fire. And going out of Pit One, Gleason. Tommy Gleason is out of the pit. Micky Stewert has just pulled out of that wreckage. We've got a yellow flag. We've got a yellow flag. It's out of control. Everyone is going out on the racetrack. We've got another one that goes down, Stewert. Stewert is coming around to spare Gleason who's been pinned into the pit. We've got yellow flags. They've got paramedics coming in. Stewert has pulled on the track. Gleason is pinned against the wall. Yellow flags. Cars off the track. [explosion booms] [upbeat music] - [Man On Phone] Hotel Las Rosas. [speaking Spanish] - Hi, I'd like a reservation, please. Do you have any rooms available? - [Man On Phone] Uh, sure. Hold on. What price range are we looking at? - I'd like the best. - Well, that would be our honeymoon suite. It's available. - Well, then pencil us in. Mr. And Mrs. Paul Rivers. - Rivers. Have you stayed with us before? Your voice sounds very familiar. Hello? [engine racing] - [Clerk] Hello. Can I help you? - Yes, we have a reservation. [engine racing] [horn honking] - [Boy] Oh, Speed Racer. - [Girl] Oh, my god. It's Speed Racer. - [Boy] Speed Racer. Hey, take us for a ride. - Not today. Not now, not now, not now. - [Boy] Come on. Please? - Hey, you touch my car, I'll break your fingers, okay? Jose, I'll be with you in a second. - Hey, Mick. Hey, hey. What'd they say? What'd they say? Did you get the money? Did you at least get enough to cover Damon's note? - Didn't happen, buddy. They turned us down flat. I wouldn't be surprised if Damon had a little something to do with it. - Told you we shouldn't have gone to that scumbag. I told you so. - I didn't have any choice, okay? - Well, what are we gonna do now, huh? We can't live with 30%. - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? What's our next move? What are we gonna do, Mick? You're supposed to go down and talk to the bankers. You're supposed to get the money. You said it was all set up. - Tommy, I can't go down and take care of it. I did set it up. - You said it was all set up. - I had a meeting. It didn't go the way I thought. And yeah, I need to work out my options here. - [Tommy] You didn't work it out. - I can't make a decision unless I know what my options are and I don't need you in my face screwing around with me right now! - We'll fucking lose this place. - We gotta pay the gardener. - Excuse me? - I put $300 in the drawer the other day to pay the gardener and it's not there. He's outside, so go take care of it. - I'll take care of it. Why don't you relax. Why don't you take a sauna or something? Oh, man. - Look at this place, it is unbelievable. This is amazing. I'm so happy that we're here. I needed this trip. What's in the briefcase, Paulie? - [Paul] Wouldn't you like to know? - Yes, I would. - Yeah, so why'd you suddenly decide to come along with me on this trip, huh? - Well, that's a silly question, honey. I love you, why else? - Why this place? Why not the place I wanted to go? - Well, I saw a picture in a magazine and it looked great. Look at it out there. It's beautiful. Come here, I've gotta show you something. This is great. Look at this place. Not bad, huh? - It's not bad if you don't hate pink and green. - Come here. [laughs] It's magnificent. Hey, Paulie. If I take good care of you, baby, will you show me what's in that briefcase under the bed? Huh? Hmm? [laughs] You're the best, Paulie. Mm. You're the best. Mm. Mm. Mm. [sighs] [tense music] - Don't move. Don't move. I've got a message from Damon. He said you're late with the rent again. - I got some money coming in this weekend. - That's not good enough. He said he's tired of carrying you, Mr. Stewert. He says to tell you you are not his hijo. One week or he's closing you down. - One week? How am I supposed to come up with 400 grand in a week? - Why don't you raise the price of margaritas? - I need to talk to Damon myself about this. - He'll be at the fights. - I'm gonna get you sometime without that knife, pal. - You wouldn't stand a chance. One week or I come back and I cut you a new smile. You moved. - What's the matter with you? We had an arrangement. Told you if there's a problem, you come talk to me about it. - Gee, I don't know why you don't impress me, half man. [grunts] - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - Let me help you. - No, no, no, no, no. I just want my chair. - I got it, I got it, I got it. Excuse me. Thank you. He likes to do it himself. You all right, big guy? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Just blew a tire. I'm not out of the race yet, right? - That's right. - You okay? That son of a bitch. Look at your neck. [soft guitar music] - [Micky] How you doing? - [Woman] Oh, I'm great. - [Micky] Everything's okay? - Mm-hmm. - [Micky] Great. - No wonder you quit racing. You've got it made down here. - Hell, I'm still racing. It's just mortgage deadlines now. [laughs] - [Woman] Beautiful place you have here. It's great. Yeah, I love it. Oh, how's your friend? - [Micky] Good. - [Woman] Hope he's all right. - [Micky] So, how long will you be on your honeymoon? - Well, forever, I hope. [laughing] Yeah. - Would you like a drink? - Yeah, I would. That'd be nice. - Maria! - [Maria] Yes. - Bring this beautiful bride one of those blue specials, would ya? - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Maria] Oh, beautiful bride. - Que pasa, hombre? - Hey, man. [clears throat] - [Micky] Is that who I think it is? - Yeah, I don't know what the hell she's doing here. - I don't know, but I bet we're gonna find out. - That's all you need is her in your life again. Fuck. - Hey, Micky. How you doing? - Pretty good. How about yourself? - Surviving. - What the hell are you doing here? - You know, I've never been as happy as I was with you. Don't you, hmm? - I don't know, dove. Things have changed. I'm seeing somebody now. - Does she, uh... Does she do the kind of things I used to do for you, Micky? I know what you like, remember? - It's just different. I needed something else. - Oh, I know what you need. [phone ringing] People don't change that much. Do they, Micky? - Mick! Hey, Mick! Mick! Phone call! - I gotta go. - See ya. - Mick, you wanna take this one. - Yeah. - Mick? It's me. I'll be landing in five minutes. - [Micky On Phone] Five minutes? - Yes. You didn't forget I was coming, did you? - No, no, no, no. I was just taking care of a couple of things around here. - You want me to get a taxi? - No, no, no. I'm on my way. I'll be there in a couple of minutes. Just hang tight. - Okay. Bye. - I'll see you soon. [propellers whirring] I gotta go get Jesse. - You drive carefully, Mick. Maria. - Thanks. Bye. [engine revving] You're really glad to see me, aren't you? - Oh, come on. I've been looking forward to this all month, honest. - Beware of men who say that word. - Seriously, I've spent a lot of time thinking about the last time we saw each other. - Oh, I bet you did. Why won't you sleep with me? What am I doing wrong? - That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. But since you brought it up, it was very refreshing. Different. Besides, we saved that part for this trip. - Maybe. Oh, thank you. [engine starts] [laughing] - So, did you miss me? - Only when I thought about you. Did you miss me? - All the time. How long are you down here for? - I don't know yet. Depends on these tests I do today. - You tell your boss their beautiful marine biologist is welcome down here anytime she wants. - You know, it's really beautiful down here. Let's hope we're not here in five years. - Hey, don't say that. I got a hotel to run. - Then I better shut up. - How about a nice glass of champagne? - Oh, that sounds good. What time is it? - Four o'clock. - Yikes. I have to be on the beach at 4:15 exactly. It's the only time I can run these tests. - Why don't we hook back up for dinner then? - Sounds good to me. - I'm really glad you're here. See, I'm learning. I didn't say honest. - No, you didn't. [people shouting] - [Paul] Damon. - Paul. - And this is my wife Lisa. [speaking Spanish] - Sit, be entertained. Wine for my friends. - Brutal little sport you've got here. - Oh, this is not a sport, Paul. This is an art. [tense music] What do you think? Are we in business? - I have the money, but my people are very definite about something. I have to have proof that. - Governmental assurance that they'll be free to drill in coastal waters. I'll bring the documents by the hotel tomorrow night. All you have to do is have the two million. Hmm? [people cheering] [people shouting] [people applauding] - Damon, I need to talk to you. - What, are you blind? He's busy. - [Damon] It's all right. We have a little problem. Don't we, Mick? Sit. - I'd really rather speak outside if that's okay. - Nah. Come on, Mick. You might learn something here. Sit. Which bird do you like? - I don't want to bet on birds, Damon. - Must be a little short today, huh? I'll bet for you. 500 on the speckled bird for Mr. Stewert. - [Man] And for you, Senor Vasquez? - The same on the other one, the big one. You're gonna learn an awful lot about power here, Mick. - I wanna pay you the money I owe ya. I need a little more time. - Mick, we both know the answer to this dilemma. You drive for me, you race for me. You do what you do best. The hotel problems take care of themselves. Huh? - I got my reasons for not driving. Can't we work this out some other way? - Mick, look at them. Are they saying to each other, can't we work this out some other way? [roosters clucking] - I'll cover it. - Mick, your rooster's dead. [laughs] You, I like. [people chattering] [subdued music] [waves crashing] - It's beautiful. Thank you. - So what made you want to become an ecologist anyway? - I guess growing up in Hawaii I realized how beautiful nature was and I wanted to make sure that we didn't ruin the few unspoiled places we had left. So, how's it going with your hotel? - You don't want to know. [both laugh] No, it's been rough. We're going through some problems right now, but we're gonna get through it. What about you? How's work? - Oh, God. This place is so corrupted it makes me sick. Do you know that someone is paying off the government so that foreign interests can drill offshore here? - I see the rigs going up all the time. - In another five years we'll have another Santa Monica Bay. - So who's buying it all? - Some local bigshot named Vasquez. - Damon. - [Jesse] You know this guy? - Yeah. Damon's like God down here. He runs everything. If you need something done, you go through Damon. - Nice. Thank you. - [Micky] To Jessica and to Las Rosas. - Thank you. I'm sorry. - [Micky] What's the matter? - Nothing. It's stupid. - [Micky] Come on, you can tell me. - I was just thinking what would happen if you were to disappear right now. - [Micky] I'm not going anywhere. - See, that's what I mean. It's like you always know the right things to say to me. Like you're so good at this and I'm not. Tell me. How many women do you have in your life right now, half a dozen? - Shh. One. - You don't have to lie to me. - I'm not lying to ya. - Tell me the truth 'cause I swear it doesn't affect the way I feel about you. All I want is for you to tell me the truth. - Hi. Any room in there for me? Thanks. I don't believe we've met. I'm Lisa. - Jessica. - So how long have you two been together? - About a month. - [Lisa] Micky and I go way back. - Let's go, Jesse. - Hey, where are you two going? The fun's just getting started. - What fun? - Tell her, Mick. Tell her how we celebrated Daytona. - That's enough, Lisa. - He had three women doing anything that he wanted. - I was a kid. I was a little crazy back then. - Yeah, one time we even went out in his Lotus and did it there. 150 miles an hour. You know the best part though? The best part's when we had a friend along with us. Do you want to be our friend, Jesse? - I don't know what the hell you're up to, Lis, but you're out of line right now. - Oh, I don't know about that. Maybe our little friend here digs women. - I think I'd know if she did. - Maybe you're not as smart as you think, Mick. Okay, Lisa. Let's go have some fun. - You mean it? - Oh, yeah. - Bye, Mick. - Jess. [yells] - You know, you two deserve each other. - I think so. - Jessica, wait. Wait a second. - [Lisa] Let her go. - Lisa, stop it. Jessica! - Come here. I always said, Micky, we should make the best out of a bad situation. - [Micky] Lisa, cut it out. [Lisa laughing] - There he is. Mick, you know what time it is? - It's time to get this fucking worm out of the bottle. - [Tommy] You've had enough of that. - Smoke 'em out, Tommy. - And there he is, the old Mick. I knew when Lisa showed up, the old Mick wouldn't be far behind. - Fuck Lisa. I'm not cutting it anymore, Tommy. This place. This whole fucking deal. The first girl that I meet that I really think is worth something, that's real to me... I'm not cutting it. - What are you saying? What are you saying? - I'm saying it's time to cut the bait, man. It's time to go find a new dream to fuck up. - No, no, no. I can't do that. I'm stuck here. I sink or swim here. - God bless ya. - Why am I having such trouble understanding this? All you gotta do is race a couple times for this guy and our worries go away. What's the problem? - No, no, no. Your worries go away. - [Tommy] What's that mean? - Forget about it. - I'm not gonna forget it, Mick. - You want to know why I don't race anymore, Tommy? I'm scared. - You're scared? What are you scared of? - I'm scared of the booze. I'm scared of the women. I'm scared of the drugs. I'm scared of that lifestyle, it's a freak scene. I'm afraid if I go race for Damon again, I would fall back into that same fucking pit. I won't be able to claw myself out of it. - No, no, no, man. I'm gonna be there. It's gonna be okay. We were handling it all before the accident. It's gonna be the same way. - Tommy, no, we weren't handling it. You're wrong. I was this far away from killing myself before your accident. - No, we'd just won Daytona, man. We were on a roll. - It was going faster and faster. It was gonna catch up to me. I couldn't get off this Ferris wheel. I was looking for the line, man. I was pressing the edge. I was gonna fucking kill myself. - [Tommy] What are you talking about? - The line between life and death. I used you, bro. I used you to take care of myself, man. And now you're asking me to go back. - You got out for your own reasons? - You were my cover. I thought it was a much better excuse to say to the press, hey, I'm gonna take a little hiatus here and help my buddy recover from an accident, then say Micky Stewert is a chicken shit. - I wish you told me that before, man. I've been wheeling around here feeling like a dog thinking that I ruined your career, man. I wish you told me that. - I swear to God, I didn't know until now. I just figured it out. - Buddy, if you don't want to race, don't race. Who needs paradise anyways? Do you mind? I'll punch you. [laughing] [waves crashing] [slow jazz music] [thunder rumbling] [glasses clinking] - [Maria] Tommy, wake up. Tommy, Mick needs you to work the front desk. [Tommy grunts] I'm sorry, baby. - That's okay. I'm awake. What's wrong? - Well, the gardener, he quit this morning, so Mick is mowing the lawn. - Shit, I was afraid of that. You're not gonna leave us, are you, Maria? - [Maria] You and Mick have been so good to me. - That's true. - [Maria] So I'll stay as long as I can afford to. - I'll tell you what. When we get out of this mess, I'll make you night manager and double your pay. - [chuckles] Okay. - Well, come on. Get back to work. - Yeah, Harry? It's me. Yeah, I'm going downstairs right now to transmit that fax. Yeah, can you get on it right away? Yeah, I need a breakdown, [knocking on door] a complete breakdown, of all the toxins. [knocking on door] Hang on for a second. - Peace. - Don't even try. - [Micky] Wait a minute. - What? - [Micky] What's the matter? - It's not working, Mick. Just forget about it. - No, I'm not gonna forget about it. I meant everything I said to you last night. - You know, you're really good. And you know, I almost fell for it, too. Oh, I don't have a girlfriend. You're the only one. I'm not seeing anybody else but you. - You gotta give me a chance. Now, that girl last night, she was somebody from my past, but I haven't seen her for three years. She just showed up here. I mean, I realize what it may have suggested to you, but there's nothing going on between me and her. Nothing. Nothing. - I'm on the phone. - I'm not gonna give up on you. You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. - [Lisa] Hey. - Jesus Christ. Get the hell out of here. - Relax, I'm here on business. I'm gonna save your ass. I know you're in trouble down here. - [Micky] I'm afraid you're a little late. - It's never too late. I'm your angel of mercy. - [Micky] You're no angel. - This time I am. They're gonna close this hotel down within a week, aren't they? What if I could change that from happening? Ooh, I see I got your interest now. I'm glad to see it. You're not interested in me, are you? But you're interested if I could save your ass. - Stop fucking around with me, okay? - I'm not fucking around with you. What if I told you I had a source of capital. I could buy out Damon right now and have clear sailing for this place. - I'd have to laugh in your face. - Well, you better hold it together because it's true. Come here. Come here. I'm not gonna bite you. Come on. Here's the deal. I save you, you save me. - What's that mean? - That means I want you back. I've been miserable ever since we split up. I know I fucked up, Mick. But that doesn't mean we weren't great together. Now, look. Paulie's got two million dollars in untraceable bills stashed in the room just waiting for you to take it. The money and me go together, though. Think about it, Micky. - [Tommy] Hey. What is it? What do you want? What are you doing here, huh? - Just vacationing, Tommy. - Bullshit. You're after something. You almost ruined his life before. - Oh, I almost ruined his life? I don't think so. I seem to remember it a little bit different. You caused him his career, not me. Don't forget that. Why don't you just go wheel yourself off into the sunset. [subdued music] - [Lisa] Here's the deal. I save you, you save me. - [Tommy] All you gotta do is race a couple of times for this guy and our worries go away. What's the problem? - [Lisa] Paulie's got two million dollars in untraceable bills stashed in the room just waiting for you to take it. The money and me go together, though. - [Damon] You drive for me, you race for me. You do what you do best. The hotel problems take care of themselves. [engine racing] [tense music] [tires squealing] [laughs] [tires squealing] - Where are you going? - I already told you. I'm going out. My girlfriends are coming to pick me up. Baby, come on. Stop it. They're gonna be here any minute. I'm gonna be late. - What girlfriends are these? - Don't tell me you're getting jealous on me now. What are you worried about? Who do I love? Hmm? Hmm? - Have your ass back here by 10 o'clock. - Yes, sir. - Going out alone tonight? - Yeah, you bet I am. I can't stand that son of a bitch. He makes my skin crawl. Take the money, Mick. Don't be stupid. I'm gonna go buy you some time. [tense music] [phone rings] - Front desk. - [Tommy] Ooh, shot down. [laughs] Unbelievable. - Don't mess with me right now. [Tommy laughs] Roberto, come out here and cover the front desk for me. Thanks. - [Tommy] Hmm. Oh. Amateur. - I'm so glad you came. - [Lisa] You don't know what I risked to be here. - [Damon] What are you after, Lisa? - Power. Turns me on. - [Damon] How do you feel about money? - I like that, too. Whoa. [laughing] Christmas. [laughs] - You know, Paul would kill you if he knew you were here. - Then you better be worth it just in case he finds out. Come here. [tense music] - Yes sir, Senator. They've got the documents. The deal's going down tonight. - [Senator On Phone] Paul, I don't need to tell you how hot this thing is. Now we're counting on you. [Lisa laughs] You are to deny any knowledge of this. So just make sure there's no screw-ups. - I'll have everything you need by tomorrow. - How you doing, buddy? Come on, man. That's good, you want it? Touch that, touch it. That what you want? Come on. - Oh. Come on. - Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. You son of a bitch. [panting] - Oh. [laughs] - Don't take it personally. I'm just doing my job. [grunting] [moaning] [chattering] [camera shutter clicking] [speaking Spanish] - I don't know, Chief. These people, they come here for privacy, I try to give it to them. - Not such a good job this time. Eh, Mick? [rooster crows] - Jefe. - Oh, I can see I've kept you from an appointment. I'm sorry. - No, he kept it for me, baby. Is it all there? - I don't know. It's locked. [yells] - Lis. Lis, you don't have to leave so soon. What ever happened to romance? - [Lisa] No, I do. Paul's probably wondering where I am. - Oh, I can assure you right now, you're the last thing on Paul's mind. Who else knew about my money, Lis? - Nobody. - Nobody. - Ow. - Nobody. - What are you doing? - Kind of narrows it down, doesn't it? What do you know about my money? - Nothing. I didn't get involved in Paul's affairs. - So, what are you saying? You don't mix business with please, Lis? Is that what you're saying? [gun chamber rotating] Where the fuck is my money, Lis? - I don't know. I don't have it. - Okay, that's fine. If you didn't take it, then you can give me a fucking name, can't you? You give me a goddamn name! - I don't know! [gun clicks] - I can see you thinking, Lis. I'll give you another chance. [gun chamber spins] Where's my goddamn money? You give me a fucking name! - Mick. Maybe Mick. - Mick? You know Mick? Oh, shit. Get out of here. Hey, Lis. [gun clicking] Get dressed. We're gonna find out how well you know Mick. [water rushing] - [Lisa] So, decided to take the money after all. You've got more balls than I thought, Micky. I didn't think you could do it. - It's not gonna work. You wasted your old man to try and set me up. I'm on to you, Lis. - [Lisa] Fuck you, Micky. You try and cut me out, it's suicide. - Sorry, no vacancy. - Well, there will be once you fucking check out. I'm here for my money, Mick. - I don't have it, Damon. - You don't have it? What does that mean, you don't got it? Does that mean I don't got the money that I owe you for the hotel, Damon? Or does that mean, I don't have the money that I ripped off Rivers? - That I ripped off? Wait a minute. You waste the guy and you don't even know where the money is? You're slipping. - Cut the fucking shit, man. Now you know better than to fuck with me. You ripped off Rivers to get the money that you owe me. The only problem with that is you can't fucking pay me with money that's already mine, Mick. - Wait a second. Don't be stupid. Now the chick's playing us both. She took the money. - Is that true, Lis? Are you lying to me? - No. I don't know where the money is. I already told you that, okay? He was the only one who knew where it was. The only other one. - Mick, I think you're just a little upset. I think once you've had a chance to relax and think, you're gonna find my fucking money. In the meantime, your old pal Lisa here is gonna be with me. One of my friends is gonna stay here with you in case you get any ideas about taking a sudden fucking vacation. You try anything, I swear to God, I'll cut you up and then I'll cut her up right behind ya. Now I want my goddamn money, Mick. I want my goddamn money and I want it tonight. Now if you get any ideas about calling the cops, they're already so deep in my fucking pocket I got a rash. - Fuck. - You know, Lis, I gotta tell ya. After all that, I believe ya. You didn't take that money. - No, I didn't. - Nah. You had somebody else do it for ya. - No way. - Oh, yeah. And you do have a way of persuading people. Don't ya, Lis? Especially desperate people like Mick. - I wouldn't do it. There's no way. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't put Mick up to it. - I gotta tell you, Lis. Sometimes it's a little hard to tell where your loyalties lie. [phone rings] - Front desk. Sure we do. How about court number four? At four o'clock? Four at four? Okay, we'll see you then. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Could you tell housekeeping not to make up our room today? - Sure, no problem. - Thanks. - Thanks. - [Damon] Now I want my goddamn money, Mick. I want my money and I want it tonight. [suspenseful music] [dog barking] - Shut him up. - Shh, shh, oh. - We're in a restaurant, for God's sake. - Okay, okay. He is. - We're leaving. - Why? - It's business. - I wanna know why. - [Man] It's business. - [Woman] What business? - [Man] Keep him quiet. - Roberto, watch the desk for me, okay? I'll be right back. - Yes, sir. [phone rings] Front desk. Can I help you? [suspenseful music] [dog barking] - Shut the dog up. We're in a restaurant. - All right. All right, all right. - Can we get a menu? [door closes] - [Roberto] Mick, telephone call for you. - [Micky] Did I get any messages? - Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick. I gotta talk to you. - I'm on the phone. - It's important, I gotta talk to you. - Mr. Rottemeir. It's the bank, I'll talk to you later. - All right, come find me later, Mr. Bigshot. - Thank you. Thank you for calling. [suspenseful music] Oh, uh, housekeeping. - [Damon] Do this together, huh? [knocking on door] - Come back later. I'm busy. - Hi. I need to talk to you. - Now's not a good time. - I've been looking for you everywhere. What happened last night? Are you in trouble? - Remember the girl in the jacuzzi? - How could I forget? - Well, the guy she checked in with was killed last night. - What? Who did it? - Damon. - Why? - He owed Damon two million dollars that mysteriously disappeared. Now they think I got it. - Oh, my god. Did you tell this to the police? - With my luck, they're in on it. You can't stay here anymore, Jesse. It's not safe. You gotta go. - I'm not going anywhere. - Yes, you are. I don't want you to get hurt. - Mick, the only thing that could hurt me now is being without you. [waves crashing] [tense music] - Give me the good news, Mick. - I don't have your money, Damon. - That's not very good news. You know, I think the best possible thing you could do in this situation would be to tell the truth. - I'm telling you the truth. I didn't take it. I don't got your money. - All right. All right, that's fine. I'm willing to deal here. I'm gonna do something to make you do the right thing. I'll offer you a finder's fee. $10,000. - I don't care if you give me $20,000. I can't give you what I don't got. - Did I say $10,000? I meant 50,000, Mick. I'm gonna give you $50,000 and I'm gonna toss in Lisa's life. That's the best I can do. - What, are you insane? Ow! God! You son of a bitch! - You have become a liability, okay? The police need a suspect. And frankly, I don't need a partner. - Hey, let's just keep this between you and me, all right? - You're not listening to me. Now, killing her gets you off the hook for what happened to Rivers. I'm doing you a fucking favor, Mick. You owe me. Waste her. - My pleasure. [yelling] [gun fires] [dramatic music] - Not the pistol. Give me a shotgun. [guns firing] [glass shattering] Don't kill him, just stop him. [guns firing] [buzzer buzzing] [metal bangs] - Come on, baby. [glass breaking] [suspenseful music] [ceramic shatters] [gun firing] [glass shatters] [explosion pops] [glass shatters] [gun fires] - Did you hear that? Listen. [grunting] Jesus Christ! Come on, hurry it up. - [Woman] I'm trying, I'm trying. [thunder rumbles] - Jesse? Jesse? - Oh, my god, Mick. Are you all right? What's going on? I tried calling the police, I couldn't get out. - Shh. It's okay. They must've cut the phone lines. Room to room should still work. I want you to get in the bathroom and close the door. Go. [phone rings] Tommy. - Yeah. You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, but they wasted Lisa. - [Tommy On Phone] I know, I saw. - [Micky On Phone] I'm in room 406. - Get your ass down here. Now. - Okay, I'll be right down. [tense music] [gun fires] Well, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. Good news is we've got some more guests. The bad news is, I don't think they're paying. - I've been trying to tell you. All those guys got was an empty suitcase. I got the money. I saw Rivers stash it up in his room. Maria and I went up there. We got it. - What do you mean you saw him? - On the monitor. When we built the place, I put a couple extra monitors up in the honeymoon suites. I figured what the hell. - You took the money? [gun fires] [electricity zaps] You're the one who took the money. - [Tommy] Shit, they blew the power. - Man, I don't fucking believe this. You got the money. I'm gonna kill you. - [Tommy] They're gonna kill us anyway no matter what we do. - [Damon] I'm gonna give you one last chance. 100,000 and you walk away. - Fuck. - You got any idea how many there are? - I don't know. They're swarming all over this place, man. I took one out upstairs. I don't know. - [Tommy] Okay. Cover me. Cover me. [guns firing] - [Micky] Get back! - I think I got one. I think I got one of 'em. Fuck. - Where the hell are they? [footsteps approaching] What the hell's going on? - Mick, I have someone out here who'd like a word with you. Mick! Come on! - No, it's a set-up. [Jessica yells] [laughs] - Mick! What do you think you're worth, baby? Two million bucks? More than the last one, I'll bet. I know you better hope so. Mick, come on! We're both civilized men here. There's no need for further bloodshed. Should we try this again? [speaking Spanish] - [Micky] Okay, we deal! [gun cocks] [tense music] I don't have the money, Damon. I can't give you what I don't have. [Damon laughs] - Leave her alone! - Bring that fucking bag down here and put it on the ground. If the money's in the bag, then we'll leave her alone. If it's not, we'll gonna kill her, Mick, and then we're gonna kill you. - No deal. - No deal? No deal. [speaking Spanish] - How do I know you're gonna let her go? - Well, Mick, as I see it, you don't have much of a choice, buddy boy. - I promise you. You won't feel a thing. - Okay! - Move it! Put it down. Now, get back. Get your fucking hands up. Get back. Get back. Don't try any fucking thing here, man. Don't try and be a hero, Mick. - You see the money, you let her go. - That was our deal. [laughing] You had it all the time, man. Shit. Keep the hands up. Mick, you lied to me. You had it all the fucking time and you lied to me. After all I've done for you. I'm hurt. Cut her. - Now! [guns firing] [dramatic music] - See you at the hacienda, Mick. [Jessica yelling] - [Jessica] Mick! [tires squealing] [engine revving] [glass shattering] Mick. - [Micky] Jesse. Are you okay? [siren wailing] [man on radio speaking Spanish] - Tommy. Ay, dios. You've been shot. - I'm okay, I'm okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be just fine. - Does it hurt? - No, no, no. Hey, looks like you're gonna get that promotion to night manager after all. Mick, Mick. - How you feeling, partner? [subdued music] - [Tommy] Mick, there's only half a million in that bag the police took. I got the other million and a half stashed away. Think about it.
