Toho A Production of ATG & Can Enterprises We start together But they get farther from my eyes, the sound of their footsteps fades out. The wind and the scenery rush towards me, the first in the race. I press forward... against the wind pressure. It is as if... I gambled all of my strength. This is the toughest part in running. But you won't know how good it feels... if you've never come first in a race. The winner is Isamu Arita, Sasebo High School, Nagasaki Prefecture. Arita. Isamu Arita! Yes. YOUTH PART II 11.3 seconds. 11.3 seconds. Cycling School of Japan Aptitude Test This is the end of the morning tests. Starting at 1 PM are tests for 1, 500-metre race. Wait a minute! You're heavy!

I'll take over my family's gas station. Bye. But... my Dad said I should leave home and study. I... Want to go to Tokyo. - Have some. - Yes. Sports University? Yes. What for? To be a PE teacher? No. Going to university? Haven't decided. Sports university, no. But your grades aren't bad. Go to a normal one. Don't think you're somebody just because you won the high school race. You're quick, so What? Study and hobbies don't mix. Suppose you become a top athlete, you won't be able to support yourself. You'll get old. You can't run forever. Some Olympic players have killed themselves. You need a safeguard. Some say... you don't need a degree. It's just idealistic. The truth is, you are your degree. You too? I'll heat the bath water. Do what he says. You don't know the world. So... a degree is important. You went to Kyoto University. You work in a bank and married the owner's daughter. 80 What? What? Sports University. - No allowance for you. - Fine! Not even the admission fees! You'll complete the 1,500-metre race after 3 laps. The results from the 2nd test won 't affect your admission chances. Please try your best... to see what you can achieve. NIPPON OIL Come in. Can you go faster? - Too slow for you? - It's better to go faster. Let's do it. Hurry. Even a powerful machine...

You rusted machine! A break. It's a sauna in here! What's up? Neighbours said we're too noisy. We borrow this place from Kawai. But only on Sundays. Oh yes, Isamu. What's up? I need to talk. - Bye. - Bye. You'll work? Saikai Shipyard. When? When I graduate. Your dad found that job? No. Mr. Uehara, my teacher. That cycling race freak? The maths teacher? Well... good for you. Hi. You're saving up for university? Good. I didn't finish high school. So I must work here. You've been here 3 months. Come and drink at my place. It's my sister's snack bar. She does it on her own. Until 5 or 6 years ago, she worked at a bar for Gls. She lived hand to mouth By tricking Gls. Fewer Americans now. When you can't buy yourself a drink, go there. Drink my bottle. You don't like motorbikes? I don't like machines. I run on my feet. They go so fast you can't see anything You won't get that by running. Even a powerful machine... Will get rusty if it stops running Day after day and after day, This cramped rubbish heap I'm fed up with this town! Fly out of here! Machine stuck in a mudslide Fly into the night! You rusted machine! Fly out of here! Machine stuck in a mudslide Fly into the night! You rusted machine! Hey you energetic boy... Lying on a squeaky bed I look around so hard, But there's no place for me I'm fed up with this town! Those bikes are different from this one. Why must you go up front? There are special bikes to do the fighting! I know you're saving up for university. But still, it was you... who borrowed it. Sorry. I'll pay for it. That bike is my lover. It turned to ashes in one night. You took away my bike, my everything. Hi. Quit your job. Help me out. Economy's bad. I got fewer orders. I have to lay off staff. I'll be grateful if you help me. Do it. - You do it. - Fool! Think about it. Do it! You'll take over the ironworks someday - Don't force me! - What? I know you've joined the bikers! - None of your business! - It is! 80 saving up for university is just a lie? You! Welcome. I'll be back. Welcome. Whisky... and water. Yes. Haraguchi's bottle. You're Minoru's friend? His biker friend? Yes. You guys... have fun at the rock bar on Saturdays. All you do are childish things. All of you. We're workers. You're drinking someone else's Whisky! You're a man, don't be a miser. Spend your own money in this kind of bars. Shut up! I just paid your brother a lot of money. For the ice! - It's not enough. - Not enough? Who will come here? Hey. Hi. Do you like me? Love me? Which one? Hotel or inn. Which one? Hotel. I want to be a race cyclist too! The training is tough. It is. - Nishino had been with the Giants. - Oh. He said, at the cycling school, the training was so tough, only the... ace player of the Giants would train as hard. CYCLING SCHOOL: PUPILS WANTED APTITUDE TEST (FOR INEXPERIENCED CYCLISTS) 100-METRE, 1,500-METRE RUNNING, JUMPING UEHARA MATHS SCHOOL OK? Don't forget this. That's all. - Bye, teacher. - Be careful. Mr. Uehara. Is cycling school tough? Yes. It's the elite of the race cycling world. It's very competitive once you're in. It's tough. There's the ”Technical" group, but what's the “Aptitude" group? For example, an athlete or a hockey player... may have the potential to be a race cyclist. The aptitude test is to find out their potentials. If I pass the aptitude test, I can get in Without cycling experience? In theory, yes. The feet of a cyclist... are like machines. They're trained from your childhood, and become machines. To be a pro, it's not just a mind game. - Race cyclists make a lot of money? - Yes. By their feet and brain. How much? Tens of millions. Business is bad. Temps like us... will all be fired. And then you can't earn your university money You'll keep going? It can't be helped. Kawai. He's... Kawai! Isamu. Long time no see. They told me you're back for summer vacation. How's university? Still playing rugby? No. It's different from high school. The training is tough. I can't stand it. Is your plan working out? Come up. It's not... the right time. You know her, right? Tokuko Kitazawa of Group E. I... I'm back to get engaged to her. I'll come again. OK. Sorry. - Jino. - Yes? You saw Haraguchi? Not recently. Akiko? I haven't seen her. Let's do it? Light. Well... I won't just love anybody with money. Only men who make their own money. Yes? Look. Men who flaunt their parents' money, I don't like them. Money is everything. If you have no money, go rob someone. Or steal it. Men who made money by themselves, I respect them. You're rich. I have more. You have some Bufferin? What? Tranquillizer. No. Why? I drank too much. My head hurts. Hey. Lend me money. I'll pay you interest. 200,000. In return, you can have it for free. I'm lonely tonight. I want someone to love. You have money? Lend it to me? You can have it for free. What a downpour! Thanks for the money. I'll return it. Bye. - Hey. - What? - Where are you going? - Home. Bye. Wait! Let's do it. - Some other time. - Tonight. - But I... - What? My period has just started. I'm OK. I'm not! Period! Pregnant? Get rid of it. Where? A hospital, of course. - But. - What? I don't have money. Me... neither. Then What? Whatever! It's not only my responsibility. Half of it is yours. PEDIATRIST, GYNECOLOGIST Take care. You OK? Thank you. Thanks. You owe me half. Results of this 1 st test will be out on June 16. Candidates who pass this, please go to Japanese Cycling School... in Shizuoka Prefecture to take the 2nd test on July 11 to July 15. SECOND TEST FOR NEW STUDENTS Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture. Minami-cho, 3-2-8. - You're for Aptitude? - Yes. The next table. TECHNICAL TEST APTITUDE TEST “This candidate passed the aptitude test.“ Don't be a race cyclist! I've decided. Do something better! Such as? A decent job! Decent? This is gambling! I've already decided. Fine! This is not your home. JAPAN CYCLING SCHOOL Get up! CLASS SCHEDULE Now, basic training. If you want to be like them, racing on the track, then you must suppress your urge... to be lazy. Racing on the track isn't as easy as you think. Understand? You don't know how to fasten this and you want to be a race cyclist? Done. Stay balanced. Yes, like this. Yes. Next. No. 28! Keep staying balanced! Next. No. 100! Where are you going? Do better! Sprint. Here! Do better! Heads up! Turn. Your armpits! Faster! Yes. Yes. Try harder! Yes. Shaking? Yes. That's it for basic training. Now you know how to ride a bike. But racing on the circuit... isn't just riding a bike. The toughness is to be experienced... in your daily training. Understand? Hey! You! Stop! Where are you going? Hey! Stop! Idiot! I just said stop! You want to die? Arita! No cycling on roads! Don't you know the rules? Rule breakers hold nothing sacred. Think of the people who will bet their lives on you! Rule breakers hold nothing sacred. Understand? Run 30 laps around the track. Go! Your thigh muscles! They were so lean when we started training. I worked hard. No big deal. Just one more year. When you graduate, you'll be like me, Kitahara. And get rich like your brother. 40 million per year. Kitahara... Seiichi Kitahara of Chiba? Yes. His older brother. In horse racing terms, he has good lineage. So you're following his footsteps? Well... Where did you train? Bicycle Club of Nihon University. I'm an amateur. - Some good cyclists are from universities. - Yes. Yoshikazu Sugata. - And also... - Hideo Madarame. Seiichi Iwazaki. Zengo Kato. Hi. Excuse me. Where did you train? Aptitude. Aptitude. His ass is sore. And red. Aptitude students, you're on the lowest rank. So your caps are yellow. To proceed to blue, red, black and White, you must work hard. No. 100! You're too slow! Raise your chin! Stiffen your armpits! Raise your chin! What's wrong with you? Even aptitude boys will beat you! Try harder! Or you won't become like your brother! Try harder! Once more! Go! My brother is too good. They compare us all the time. But I can't be as good. My grades are the worst. I can't ride at all. I passed the test by fluke. My dad died early. We three brothers ate our suppers together. My mom worked... in the fields or road construction, and got home late. My brother was determined to stop her from working. He's great. I followed his path, the same high school and cycling. I'm bound to follow behind him. But this is probably the end. Arita of 43rd Term. Please come to the office at once. I'm Isamu Arita. Some cash for you. Akiko Asaoka. What for? You said half of the responsibility is mine. Here's half of the money. Akiko. Who is it? Who is it? Isamu? Why are you here? I should go home for my summer break... but I made a stop here. It's also hot in Sasebo this year. Yes. I start work at 11 in a cafe. Let's chat before that. OK. When will you be a race cyclist? I'm in special training. Oh. Is it tough? I don't do this for fun. They say I'll be king of the rookies. Wow! You'll earn a lot when you're a cyclist. 5 million in the first year for sure. - You're a golden egg! - Yes. If you get prize money, buy me something. What do you want? Well... A Persian cat! Well then. Thanks! Wait for me. I'll be right back after work. Practising? You're too slow! Try harder! Hey. What's wrong? - The screw is loose. - You don't have tools? - I don't. - I think I do. Thanks. How about this? Are you a pro? Cycling school. When will you graduate? You must be anxious for that. "Toshiyuki Yasuda of 43rd term...“ ”is expelled for smoking...” ”in the dormitory.“ Yasuda. What a pity. He trained so hard. Yes. Serves him right. Tobacco blocks your explosiveness. Yamashita! Happy with one less competitor? Cycling is like the race of life. Who has the stronger will Wins. Yasuda fell off at a bend. Yasuda... doesn't know Why he's here. What do you mean? Racing is not a hobby. Everybody aims for their goal. Pros and amateurs both have goals. You're weak. How so? You race on the track for your own fun. For that you'll never Win. I always see myself as an Aptitude. Now I'll struggle for real. Now you're also training on Sundays. Can you stand it? Yes. - I'm surprised. - What? My body grows every day I've got new muscles. I'm worried I'll lose them... if I rest just for one day. Now I understand... how great it feels to torture your body. And I feel I get better and better every day. Kitahara. It's time to part. Yes. Back to my brother. Arita. We're no longer friends. We'll meet again as rivals. Let's fight each other as pros. I hope well both make a lot of money. Bastard. I'll beat him next time! You'll be a leadout cyclist? Yes. I don't run behind others. That goes for cycling too. DEBUT OF ISAMU ARITA WILL ROOKIE ARITA ACHIEVE 6-TIME WINNING STREAK? - I'm Isamu Akita. - The document please. Akita. Your prize money for 3 Wins. How much are these? 28,000 yen. That suits you very much. Looks smart. This shirt goes along very well. Sir. This way please. - That one? - It's a new model. - What is this? - Windshield washer. Do you like it? Thanks. Welcome. You moved in with Kawai? Yes. Where's he? He went back to Tokyo for his exams. It's 6,300 yen. Keep the change. Say hello for me. In loan approvals, it's not up to me alone. I can't go on Without money. Sell this place and retire. I'll take care of you. Dad. Keep on working, you'll rot when you retire. Are you a puppy? No greetings when you come home? Your car? Yes. Bad colour. Please consider the economy right now. This trade is helpless. Do some gardening if you don't want to rot. Dad. How much do you need? I don't want your dirty money! Stay out of this. You're right. This money is made with people's blood and tears. I made this money with my legs! You're great, Isamu. Here's to your victory. - Cheers! - Me too! You've made a lot by cycling! Go away. But Why? - You forgot? - What? Go on pretending. About What? Forget it. - Have some snacks. - Mami, come. - Fill it up. - Coming. Cheers! Isamu. I've been following your races. You're doing fine. If you compete with grade B cyclists... this method won't work. You'll lose. - What? - Cycling... is won by strategic groupings. It's... done by complex planning. You won't Win on your own. I'll lead and Win. I won't race like a sissy! See if you can get to grade A. Then your leading out won't be a problem. Shut up! Arita will achieve a 10-time Winning streak! Look at him. He's from Aptitude. He thinks he'll Win. Now break away! Fool! ISAMU ARITA ENDS HIS WINNING STREAK ISAMU ARITA'S RECENT RESULTS KUMAMOTO: 3RD, 7TH, 2ND BEPPU: 4TH, 6TH, 3RD HIROSHIMA: 7TH, 6TH, 8TH Isamu! Stop! It's me! Let's talk! I'll teach you how to break away. You fool. My heart cried out, “break away!“ If you had done that, you would have won. If you can't, you'll never have a chance to make a final sprint. Mr. Uehara... I hate to race like that! Fool! Leading out... are for those with exceptional power. Not you. Please... stop being obsessed with cycling. Your wife is worried... That's my business. I'm the buyer, and you're my purchase. I lost my money... on you. So out the crap. You shouldn't park like that. Sorry. That's Saito. And Kitahara. - Our Kitahara's brother. - Just look at him. - Saito's breakaway is great. - Of course, he's a real pro. You studied maths, you should know that you'll lose in the end! I'm betting on humans. You're a weakling. You dream of a turnover. You thought you were Winning. But you'll lose, just like when you were teaching at school! Shut up! The leader will get tired first, for he goes against the Wind. The ones behind him should wait for their chances. Do you understand? If you breakaway, you'll Win! Too early! Break away now! Arita! Are you Arita? Long time no see. Yamashita is very successful now. He made 10 million in half season. We haven't met since graduation. If we're on the same race, can you help me? I can't Win on my own. Strategy is What matters? I don't know. We share the same fate. I'll follow you. Arita is going to break away! He won't lead out? He lost the guts? I won't break out again. YAMASHITA WON BY LEADOUT 15 MILLION PRIZE MONEY Cycling is Winning. If you Win, you get the prize money. Isn't that fair? I won't break out! Do you know the miserable fate of leaders? - No. - Don't you know about Takahara? He must retire. His legs... you don't know? You can't just miss out on lessons! 10 days last month! The exams are coming! We want our money back! I'm so sorry. I'm so tired. My husband is so obsessed. Why... Did you become a race cyclist? I don't hate you. Isamu. I thank you for taking care of Dad. But avoid showing your face. Forget that. It's OK with me. The neighbours... I'm OK. What's wrong? Everybody says that Mr. Uehara is mad because of you. Then tell me What should I do. Just forget it. Will you marry me? No. Are you serious this time? When you remember me, you come here, sleep with me, and leave when you're done. Let's get married. I'll... Race... for you. You're too late. Just kidding. Nothing. Are you living with Isamu Arita the cyclist? You must leave me? Please. Stay away from him. The cycling world is fussy about relationships. If you must leave me, I'll reveal your past, and your relationship with me. Even if you hurt him, I won't give in. Promise me... you won't come back to me! Now I'm making a last bet. Me or cycling? You're comparing the two? They're not the same. I can sense your loneliness... struggling with cycling. I married you to explore... this loneliness of yours. But I didn't expect it would come to this. This is my last bet. Isamu will win! Here's your money. Please count it. Arita. How are you? I know if I follow you in the next race, I'll be fine. Please do it again this time. Please. I'm the turtle. You're the rabbit. YAMASHITA: DARK HORSE Yamashita will fight hard! Arita! Stay calm! Don't wear yourself out! Arita! Yamashita isn't good as you! Fool! YAMASHITA, ARITA: DISQUALIFIED KITAHARA: WITHDRAWAL How do you feel after watching your race? Cycling is done by humans. A race must be convincing to its spectators. Why did you race so crazily? There are rules to a race. If the spectators see a race that goes beyond a cyclist's ability, they'll think something's wrong. You see? I have nothing to say. Hey! Come again tomorrow. You're too agitated now. Let's talk some more tomorrow. - I won't come. - Why? Don't be stupid. You want us to ban you? Sorry, it's my fault. I caused this to happen to your brother. They told me What happened. We only know how to run, right? - 3 litres. - Yes. - Arita. - Oh! Doing fine? This? I dropped out. They kicked you out! Not enough credits. Thank you very much. Isamu.
