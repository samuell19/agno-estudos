(Theme music) (Music stops) (Wind blowing) I am a man. I am a survivor. And I'm alone. Sun after moon... and moon after sun. Life is no longer what it used to be. Only nature brings me life... a new life. Without it I'm lost. We are men and women. Now, woman is the hunter. And man is the hunted. I am the hunted. And I am... Noland. (Birds singing) (Footsteps approaching) (Leaves rustling) (Thrilling music) (Women shouting) Man: Don't touch her! Get away from her! (Woman crying) (Thrilling music) Quiet. (Women calling) Come on! Where are you beauty!? No, no, no. There she is! Take her! You bitch! (Music fades out) (Exciting music) (Outside a can falls to the ground) (Thrilling music) (Drums playing) (Voice of a man) The trees they know, the moon is watching us. Who are you? What do you want from me? I said... who are you... and what do you want from me? Who are you? And what do you want from me? I am Noland. And I don't want anything from you. (Footsteps on broken glass) You can call me Jack. What are you doing here Jack? Hiding. And you? Where are you going? Up north. The white beach. Where are you going? Jack? Everywhere and nowhere. Where women can't find me. But, come with me!? I got to go now. Good luck Noland. Good luck. (Pan flute music) (Wind blowing) (Noland growling) (Streaming water) (Dreamy music) (Angry woman's voice) Die! Die! (Leaves rustling) (Footsteps) You have no right! Just because I'm a man! You have no right. The war is over! (Thrilling music) (Noland suffocating) (Thrilling music) The war has just begun. Tie him up! (Wind blowing) (Female voices echoing) Stop it! You wanna fight? (Speaking in Italian) Stop! Come. No man will survive. No man will breathe. No man will ever be safe as long as we are here on this earth. We will capture, torture and kill every one of those disgusting pigs. Because they are evil. And evil must die. We will fight for every woman who has ever lived on this earth. And we will rule this planet once and for all, for all eternity. Now... are you ready to kill some men!? Yeah! Are you ready to slaughter some pigs!? Yeah!! Good. Then let us pray. We are strong. We are superior. We are the only gender strong enough to rule this earth. Because we are women! We'll never give up. And we will rule this planet once and for all! Now, practice. (Speaking in Italian) You stay here. Everyone! Let's go! Now! (Tense music) (Erotic moaning) I will kill you if you move. Pig! (Theme music) Boo! Hahaha! (Groaning) (Music stops) (Thrilling music) (Speaking in Russian) (Thrilling music) Get the weapons. Get the weapons! I want him dead or alive! Get them now! (Women screaming) (Music) (Music stops) (Music starts again) (Speaking in Russian) This way. No. This way. (Footsteps approaching) (Noland is making noises) (Screaming in pain) (Music) (Speaking in Russian) (Footsteps approaching) (Dreamy music) (Sound of an arrow) (Thrilling music) Hey pig! (Music stops) (Thrilling music) (Music stops) (Dreamy music) (Woman whispering) Noland? Noland. It will be alright. I see a child... smiling and playing. I see a woman... pregnant. And she's happy. So happy. The boy looks just like you. And he's free. Freedom Noland. Freedom. I see love and peace. Peace and love. Love and peace Noland. Love and peace. (Footsteps) Hey. (Thrilling music) (Noland's voice) The ego of human beings must be restrained before the world and humanity can become one. Grow freely and peacefully. The ego is the only thing that can destroy the world and all good within. Only when love for our souls has been achieved, then everything else will shine. Peace will finally rise and spread the light across the earth. You were here, and now you're gone. We thank you for your time and for all that you did for the world. We know you're in a better place or will be soon. A place where love and peace exist. Where man and woman are one. (Music fades out) (Birds singing) (Dreamy music) Tom and Lisa. How are you doing? I've missed you. Yeah. Makes me glad to hear. I'm a happy man. Tom? How are you doing in school? You are? Good. Is biology still your favorite subject? No? English!? Well.. maybe you're gonna be the next big writer? Yeah. You know... math was my favorite subject. But I wasn't any good at it. But I never gave up. You should never give up. Yeah. And Lisa? How are your flowers doing? Good. I can smell them. Yeah. They are so beautiful. Maybe we can take a walk in the garden someday? Yeah. I would love that too. Yeah. You know... it didn't turn out the way we wanted. Yeah I know. I'm gonna build a house by the sea. Just as we planned. Yeah, a big garden too. Yeah. I love you. I love you. Love you too. And Tom? Take care of your mom. Okay? Yeah. I love you. See you. See you soon. (Music) (Drums) (Exciting music) (Man coughing) Love... is the answer. Where love exists, peace will follow... between woman and man. Find... find love. Find, find peace. Unite. Unite. Unite. (Thrilling music) (Dreamy music, streaming water, wind blowing) (Music) (Sound of an arrow) (Thrilling music) Ah shit. Coward! Fight me! (Noland screaming) (Groaning) (Exciting music) You'd better be prepared to die, pig! The future doesn't belong to you anymore! I will create a whole new world. A world that you've never seen before. A world ruled only by women. So all you can do now, man! Is die. Die! Die! Die! (Tamara screaming) Haha! (Noland screaming) (Thump) Go and build your world around you! Do what you have to do. But what will become of the world is not up to us! The good will always win and love shall always prevail. And the world will finally become one. Now, you remember this! Now you remember this! Woman! Hahaha! (Sea waves and birds singing) (Soft piano music) I hear you, I see you. Your kindness, your love. We breathe, we feel, we live. Time, life, joy. Bring the world together. Say the words and mean them. Stay here with me. Breathe into a peaceful world. Man and woman, woman and man. We are free and we are beautiful. We are soulful. The earth, the sky, the sea. Free, free, free... free. (Music stops) (Rock music)
