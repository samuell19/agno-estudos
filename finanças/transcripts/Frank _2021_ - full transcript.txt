Sometimes decisions are made out of desperation. Sometimes those decisions can destroy your life. Hello? - Hi. - Hi, Ruby. - Hi, Karen. - What's wrong? - Is... is Daddy there? - He's right behind you. There's no place in the world you're more vulnerable than your bedroom at night. As Ruby's step-aunt, Lydia, learns, it's a hard thing to shake when you feel as though you're being watched. I got popcorn. Yeah. I see that... everywhere. It's that healthy shit you buy. It's pretty dry but I kind of like it. Smoked a fat blunt a little bit ago. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. I found it on the sidewalk. - Kurt. It's fine. It was in a Ziploc bag. Oh my God, you're an idiot. - I'm so, so sexy. - Yeah. You have your moments. This is not one of them. - You worked late. - I know. I was so tired. Come get next to me. Okay. Move over. Please. Popcorn. Oh my God, you didn't even brush your teeth. - You're not going to work today? - Hmm? - What time is it? - Relax. It's Saturday. Oh. Oh, you fucker. Oh, we're having a serious morning. You okay? You look exhausted. - Thank you. - No, I think you're hot all cranky and tired. Mm. I didn't sleep at all last night. I know. I slept like a baby. Yeah. I know. I don't know. I felt scared. No, I mean... No, what do you mean? Uh, it's just bad dreams I think. You always make me watch those fucked up movies. - You have to know what's out there in the real world. - Oh, yeah, an alien hillbilly cannibal rapists are what I could be faced with? They're always looking for their next meal. Thank you for keeping me safe. I'll always protect you. I'm your husband. - I'm gonna go get in the shower. - Okay. Goodnight. Where are you, Kurt? Lydia! It's awesome here, Craig's got a keg. - Hey, that rhymes. - You're with Craig and Beth still? Yeah, is that okay? I thought you were just going for one. - I was, but Lyd they got in... - Hi, Lydia! - Hi, Beth. Can you just come home? - Do I have to? Kurt, please? Okay, fine. I'll be home in an hour. - Beth is so much cooler than you. - I know. - Love you. - Love you too. That's a long hour. Where the fuck were you? Sorry, I had to finish my game. Fuck. - Relax, Jesus. - Oh my God, you're such a fucking dick. Come on, you idiot. Why are you so mad? You said you would be home in an hour. - You were so late. - So? I was at Craig's. That's never been a problem before. I was... I was scared. - Okay? - Scared? Of what? I don't want to say. What? We drinking tonight? No. I wish. You wanna fool around then? It's like... - ...It's like 2:30. - So? I'm tired. Please. Fine. Oh, God. You're so annoying. Sweet. I'm marked for abduction. What? Cool. - Lyd? - Hi. Hi. What time are you coming tonight? Uh, Kurt gets off work at 6:30 so we'll be there around eight. Okay? Are we getting drunk? I really need you to say yes. Uh, normally I would say no, but I think I need to. - Yes. Are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm fine, Charlotte. I'm excited to celebrate your birthday. Yes, that's right! Okay, see you tonight, wear something slutty. I'm too old for slutty. Ugh. Okay, Grandma. Okay, I gotta go. I'll see you soon, poon. Okay, bye-bye. Bye. I thought you were gonna lose. I never miss! Right. Hey, what did you think of Charlotte's new husband? Hmm... They didn't waste any time getting married. He's old. Yeah, he's really old. - She can do better. - Yeah. You want a beer? No, I want tequila. Coming right up, sweet sugar. Candy... Candy tits. Hey, if I had as much money as Charlotte's new husband... ...would you let me do the ass thing to you? No, not even then. - Prude. - Oh! Tequila! Fuck, you scared the shit out of me. You gotta tell me what's going on right now, because you have been acting so fucking weird lately. - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - Are you... - God. - Are you cheating on me? - No, God, no. Then why are you acting so sketchy? You're making me paranoid. Oh, fuck. Okay. Oh. I really didn't want to. I'm... I'm afraid that will make it real. Doesn't really seem to do anything if I pretend like it's not real. Real? What real? Frank. - Frank? - I call it Frank. When I was little, if a movie scared me, I would always name the monster or ghost like, you know, a regular name so it wouldn't seem scary anymore. Okay. That makes sense. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's okay. So... so you're scared of a monster? - No. No. - What? Like a movie? Because I don't remember it. No. So... ...at night sometimes, it feels like more lately. I wake up and... and I see something standing in our room. Sometimes it's like I can't even move. - Like I'm paralyzed. - Like sleep paralysis. I saw this fucked up doc on that. Lyd, you prob... You're probably just having bad dreams. I'm sorry. I'll chill with the weird movies. No, it's not that, I'm awake. It feels like it wants to hurt us. I've just been too afraid to tell you or say anything - because then it will be real. - You're safe. Hey... you probably just need more sleep. Both of us had too much to drink tonight. - No, it's not that! - Hey, nothing... Here. Nothing is going to happen to you when you're right next to me, Okay? Hey, do you think that Frank can see us when we're having sex? Shut up. No. Have you asked him how old he is? Because he's seen some pretty dirty stuff. That's not fucking funny, Kurt. I shouldn't have said anything. - I'm kidding. Don't be mad. - I'm sleeping. I see it. Some people say Charlotte got what she deserved. She had no sympathy for her step-daughter, Ruby's death. And the only person she seemed to truly care for was herself. But when you're alone in your new big house late at night and the power is gone, sadly, you can't even see what's coming for you. But then again, maybe that's a good thing. There we go! Okay. Ah! I'm so glad we can finally do this! - Me too. - You look super cute. - Oh, you look great as always. - I know, right? It's new, don't you just love. Ah. Oh, I've never heard of this brand of wine. - Oh, well, it's nothing special but... - Oh, you didn't have to do that. We have the most amazing wine cellar. So, um, we'll just drink this one after we're already drunk then! Yeah, totally. Totally. - Come in. - Oh, yeah. Wow. Your home is beautiful. I know, right? My husband had the house before we got married but the interior design is all me. It looks great. Yeah. If you ever need any help with design stuff, it's... it's my passion. Oh, thanks. I have been dying to have you over. We have been in that Pilates class for months now, and I keep telling myself, Charlotte, that girl is cool. You need to make some friends in here. Yeah, totally. I'm glad we got to hang. - How long have you been living here? - Oh, only six months. My husband and I got married quick, so, he's older. But, yeah, I would have had you over sooner but we're having some family shit. So, uh, my step-daughter has been a nightmare lately. Um, so stressful. That must be a big adjustment for you. Mm. That's an understatement. - Are they here now? - Oh, God no. No. They took some daddy/daughter trip to a cabin that he used to go to when his older daughter was alive. - Oh, that's so sad. What happened to her? - Suicide. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Some hikers found her hanging from a tree in Bloodlane Forest. - Yeah. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I know, thanks. It's made everything so stressful for me. Like, the little one, Karen, is such a mess now. It's making life way more difficult than it has to be. I just really needed this quiet girl time. Oh, I'm sure this must be a really difficult time for them. I mean, yeah, I guess. Ruby was basically my age. They had different moms or whatever. I'm wife number four for Tom, his lucky number four we say. He loves that. Anyway, this has been all consuming and I don't want to talk about them or any more bullshit anymore. - So tell me about you. - Uh, well, there's really not that much to tell. Um, I work as a receptionist at a dentist office. - Mm! - And, um, I'm taking this really awesome writing class at night. So I've really been enjoying that. No kids. Oh, no. I have a cat named Louisiana. Louie for short. That's where I'm from originally. Lucky. Well, where are you living now? - I have an apartment right near the Pilates studio. - Oh, that's okay. Yeah. Thanks. Any special man in your life? - No, I'm single, but still looking. - Ah! You shut up! How are you still single? You're so cool. Okay, we're gonna go out, we're gonna get dressed up super hot. You can borrow something of mine. And I am going to be your wing woman. I mean, look around. I'm telling you I never miss. I believe that. I'm just not really a bar person. Well, how else are you going to meet someone? I mean, this is real fucking life, Lacey. Okay, listen to me. There is no such thing as the perfect man. Okay? You just find one that gets you close enough and buys you some nice shit and gives you some companionship. Okay? My sister, Lydia, married for love, and it is a fucking nightmare. Okay, He is such a loser. She's like this hot, successful lawyer, she could get anyone she wants. And he, like, works at a brewery - and makes a third of what she does. - Are they happy? I don't know. Who cares? I mean, she... she, like, set the bar like so low. Oh my God. I guess I'm just hoping that the fairy tale is real. Oh my God, that's cute. Well, it isn't, but that's cute. That's sweet. I love that. Oh. Oh my God, snacks. - Huh? - I made healthy snacks. You have to try my hummus. It is practically world famous. - Oh. - Okay, let's get... Oh, there we go. - Here. Yeah. - Mm. Mm. Right in the hole. Well? Delish. Right? Oh! - Mm! - I'm on a diet so I... I'm just watching my figure. - Mm. Boo. - Mm. Oh my God. Oh, shit! Party time! - Just leave it. - Okay. Oh my... Oh my God, I just had the best idea for you. - Oh my God. - What? Okay, so, I'm not always into like this, like... ...um, like, hippy dippy stuff, but I'm sure you can tell that I'm a very spiritual person. So, there's, like, this guy who basically helps you manifest your dream, man. You, like, go to him and tell him like your goals and qualities that you're looking for. And, like, apparently he's a miracle worker, he helped my friend, Lexi, land such a catch. And I was going to go to him myself but I didn't need to, because then Tom came along and, like, I knew that I hit the jackpot. I was lucky not to need the help. Tom has more money than God. Nice. Okay, hang on, I'm gonna text you this life coach guru, whatever's contact, just so you have it. Um, I don't even know what to call him, he's like literally magic. - I don't know if I really... - Just so you have it, you know, I don't want you to die alone. What? Oh my God, I was kidding. - Do you think it's a breaker? - I don't fucking know. Who knows? This house is so off. What the fuck? I'm so sorry, this is such a lame hang. - It's getting pretty late anyway. - Oh, you know what? - I got candles. - I'm getting pretty tired. So, um, do you need help with anything before I go? No, girl, I'm good. Plus the maid's here tomorrow, so fuck it. Okay, well, cool. Jesus Christ. The fuck is that? Oh, here we go. Okay, come on, I'll walk you out. Oh, that's weird. I swear I locked that when you came in. - That's creepy. Are you sure you're okay here alone? - Oh, totally, girl. Yeah. That's so sweet of you to ask though, but I'm a strong woman. Not afraid of the dark. Okay, well, this was fun. Yeah! Okay. Well, you call that guy. Let's find you your dream man. - Yeah. Okay. - I'm serious. I'll see you Saturday. - What? - In class. - Oh, right, Saturday. - Okay. Bye! Jesus Christ. The fuck is up with this power? What the fuck? Fucking cat. Fuck. Oh, God. Jeez. Oh, fuck. Fucking cat. Goddammit. Ruby... is that you? Hello? Okay. Fuck this. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. I promise I won't skin you. Okay. Fuck you, cat. I'm going to bed. Okay. You're officially an idiot. Go the fuck to bed. That's fine. That's fine. Shit. Okay. No! Oh my God. Okay. True love can come in many forms. Ruby's cousin, Mary, had been searching for it all of her life. Even though she was lonely, she knew the right one was out there somewhere. Just waiting for her. She always wanted a fairy tale ending. But Mary had forgotten... ...some fairy tales are the darkest and most twisted stories of them all. Good night. I miss you every minute. 9:15. Oh, shit. Hello. Hi, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hi. Good to see you back. I don't think we've officially met. I'm Pearl. I'm Mary Lane. Sorry, did you say your last name was Lame? Oh, no. It's Lane. Lane. Oh, sorry, my bad. Well, today is gonna be good. A lot of expression in those movements, okay? I want to feel what's inside of you. You're deep, Mary, I can tell. - Okay. - Okay, now let's get started. I want you to take form down on the ground. What are you? Now, close your eyes and in your new form, jump! That's right. That's beautiful. Now let's jump again, dig deeper! Yes! All right, now let's get into the choreography. Uh... Five, six, seven, eight. One and two. Three and four. Five and six. Breathe. Seven, eight. Nice. Okay, so, the next few weeks we've come to the end of series one of movement, and I have an extra assignment I think you all will enjoy. I want you to write down the lyrics of the song that plays within you and within your intentions of the movement. And we'll share them at the final class. I can't wait to hear them. Stupid... - Sorry, sorry. - Oh shit, yeah, I didn't see you. It's okay. We're gonna have a hell of a night, I guess. We are? Yeah, because of all that homework. - Writing lyrics and stuff. - Right. Yeah, totally. - I'm Brax. - I know because I've seen you in class. - Yeah, I'm, um, Mary. - Yeah, I know too, I guess, because they said your name out, like, in class and stuff. - Yeah. - Lane not Lame. Yeah... totally. - I'll see you next week. - Yeah, can't wait. I mean, the class, it's gonna be a fun class and stuff. Yeah, um, cool. Okay. So stupid. Hey, boo. Guess what? I'm the biggest loser ever. That's why I'll never have a boyfriend in my entire life. What's that? You don't give a shit because you're dead and you're still my only friend? Great, yep. Thanks. Barbara... ...you can't just walk into my house, we talked about this, remember? - Try to lock the door, then. - No, that's not how it works. Some of your mail came to my place again. - Your mom was gonna keep it and use it for crafts. - Oh, okay, thanks. You're going out tonight? No. I had a long the day and I'm really tired, so... I wish I could go out but my mom is always up my ass. If she wasn't, I'd totally go to a bar and bring some hot guy home and be down for Whatever. - Why don't you ever bring guys home? - I do, some. No, you don't, I'm always watching. Okay, I'm going to bed, Barbara. You don't go to bed until after Wheel of Fortune at 8:30. Okay, stop watching me. You know, if you don't use it, it can close up. It's not going to close up. You should check. I'm not going to check. My cousin Leo is looking for a girlfriend. I can always introduce you. He's starting to be a guy now because he wants to see chicks naked. I'm good. I feel bad for you. Don't. This is gonna sound stupid, but... ...I'm thinking about calling this love coach guru guy, Uncle Tom's new wife, Charlotte, told me about. I don't know, I was... She said that... ...he helped her find her friend, like the love of her life or something. She's always going off about it. I don't know. It's probably stupid. Stupid. No, you should call him. It was probably your last chance. Okay, well... good night. I'm serious. I won't leave until you promise to call him. You make me so sad. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll call him right now. Okay, you promise? Yes... I'll do it right now. Okay. I'll know if you don't. Okay, good night. Good night. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, boo. Just do it. Okay. No. Just do it. I'm going to do it. Uh, hi, um... ...my name's Mary, uh, I got your number from my aunt. I mean, my friend Charlotte, she said you helped their friend, Lexi. She said you were like a love coach miracle worker? Oh, you did? How did you know? Um... Uh... What... what do I... Yeah, I guess... I guess you could say I'm open minded. What do I want? Oh... ...I want to be in love. I mean, that's... that's what we all want, isn't it? I mean, maybe it doesn't, I don't know. Uh, I've been single now for... ...God, like ten years. I mean, God, I didn't even realize it'd been that long. Um, I live in the valley. What? Right now, like tonight? Yeah. Okay. I'll text you my address. Hey. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Well, hey, are you... Yeah, okay, he hung up. Oh my God. I'm actually sweating. - Hi. - Mary. I'm very glad you called. Okay. The vibe I'm feeling from you is crippling loneliness. Thanks. You called just in time. I mean, something's gotta give. - I... - Tell me this. Have you ever manifested from your imagination even as a child? Not sure what you mean. I mean, um... ...like an imaginary friend that you were convinced was real or a plant or a bike or a toy that you believed - had feelings. - I was a pretty shy and lonely kid. Shocking. Well, there was this giant tree I used to sit under for hours when I was little, and then one day my dad hung up a swing to surprise me and I totally freaked out thinking that he was hurting it. - Did you ever talk to this tree? - Sometimes. Perfect! Perfect. Okay, Mary, come here. Mary, come here. - You created love with this tree. - I guess. Okay, now, look at me. Now, look away. Now, look at me. Now, look away, look at me. Look at me. What I'm gonna ask you to do is going to push you way outside of your comfort zone. You're gonna have to commit and trust me in this process completely. Okay, I've done this successfully many times before, Mary. But only those that were willing to give 100% truly thrived from the process. What do... what do I have to commit to? Will you give it your commitment? - Um... - Do I have your commitment? Yes or no? I don't know. I... No! Okay. Okay. Okay. Just sit, you have it. Now, follow me here. I want you to make up your dream man. - You like men, right? - Oh, yes. Okay, so make them up. Give him a name. What does he look like? How does he feel? What does he look like naked? Have inside jokes. Know where he's coming from. Know what he loves, what makes him angry or jealous. Manifest him and believe that he's real. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Terrible. Why would I do this? I want a real man." And of course that's the goal, Mary. But people like you, they... they ooze desperation and uncertainty. It scares relationships away. But... ...if you are completely convinced within yourself, that you were in a deep, meaningful and satisfying relationship, then suddenly all those insecurities disappear and you open yourself up for something real to come in to find you and desire you. Mary, I'm... I'm telling you this is going to set you free. It's gonna put you on a fast track to real love. Maybe I'm crazy but that actually makes sense. Of course it does. I take cash or check. I... Ooh, I... I don't even... I don't even know what I owe you. - I have... - What do you owe me? Everything. But 200 is fine. That'll do. I'm going to check back in in two weeks. Okay. Hey. Jeffrey. Today it was a fun day. You look really good in that red shirt. Stupid. Okay, well... ...I'm gonna go to bed, so... ...do you want to come, or? Okay, well, don't stay up too late. Hi, babe. How was your day? Okay, well, let me tell you what happened to me. I'm still in shock, kind of, because it's... Do you remember my uncle, Tom, and his new wife, Charlotte? Yeah, that's the one. I... It's just, he called me on the drive home and something kind of strange happened. She's gone missing. Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, he and my cousin, Karen, were like on vacation and then when they got back to the house, there was like blood all over the place and the cat was covered in it. I know! Yeah. And no Charlotte. It's so scary. Oh... God. I know. I feel so bad for my uncle. It's just, he's been through so much with Ruby dying. And now this, it's like... Yeah, I know. She was a pretty terrible person but she didn't deserve to have something awful happened to her. I know she was a nightmare. Just. I know, but she brought us together. I know. You too. Yeah, I know. Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe she's just went away on vacation. She was a pretty unpredictable person. Yeah. Yeah. I know. They got married so fast. It's... Oh. Stop. Yeah. Okay. You're right. I'll stay positive for them. Thanks. Hey, do you want to cook dinner together? Okay. But I have to warn you, I only know how to cook hot dogs. It's kind of... They are? Okay. They're mine too, it's just so meant to be. It's... I... What? Fine. You can watch me all you want, handsome. I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting pretty buzzed. You are? I am pretty excited to see you drunk. Are we ready for that? I don't know. I mean... It's... It's been a long time since I've been with someone. Uh... God. You know I mean sex, right? Um... high school. Yeah. You're just my only real boyfriend I guess. I don't know. I mean, I've been out on some dates and stuff since, but... ...I never really met anyone that I connected with. I know it's kind of weird. We were in band together. Stop. Oh, don't be jealous. No. Yeah, that was a long time ago. You're gorgeous. And you're all I'm thinking about. Okay. Okay, well, hurry back. Okay. You're so... Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is what you wanted. This is what you wanted. Oh my God, you have to commit. You have to commit. Don't be scared for once in your life. Don't be scared! She felt his fingers on her skin even though she had never even seen his face. His breath on her neck, even though... he may not have even ever taken one... ...he was alive for her. Made from dust and particles and the tremble of her lip. He moved perfectly with her because... ...he was a part of her. They were one, they were love. - Oh, beautifully said, Marnie. - It's Mary, actually. - Yeah. - Thanks. Oh, did you have input on Mary's inner lyrics? Oh, me? Nope. I mean, yeah, it was just really great. - Wow. - Thanks. Okay. - Hey. - Oh, hey. - I really liked your lyrics. - Oh, thanks. I know I already... I already said that, but I... - I just wanted to say it again, so, uh... - Okay. - Hey. - Yeah? I know it's maybe late for this kind of thing, - but would you want to grab some coffee. - Right now? Yeah, now, or later? - Or now? - Um, I don't know, I... Um, yeah, you know what? Sure. Okay, awesome. I know this really cool place right down the street. - Cool. - Alright. Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah. - Plants smell great. - Yeah. They're amazing. Is that a homeless person? Barbara! What are you doing in my yard? - I like it here. - Go home. He's cute. Don't make him wait for it or else he'll find someone else. Barbara, no! I love your house. Thanks. All right. You really didn't have to walk me home. I live super close. Oh, it's... No, that's... that's okay. I wanted to. I really loved hanging out with you tonight. I wish we'd done it sooner. Me too. I actually have had this little crush on you. What? Really? You have? Oh my God, I've been wanting to ask you out since like the first moment I saw you. You were wearing those pink pants and I was like... ...I mean, anyway, uh... You should have. Well, I'm not, uh, tired. Do you want to maybe work on some of our... I'm sorry, I can't, I gotta... I have to go. okay? Is everything okay? Um, yes, yes! I'll call you, okay? Uh... I... Weird. That was super weird. Jeff... Jeffrey... I'm... I'm sorry! It's nothing. He's nobody. You know, I'm sorry. Ow. Jeffrey. You're hurting me. Let me go. No... Okay, I'm sensing a lot of tension, a lot of negative energy. Yeah, okay. You think? Mary... ...why am I here in the middle of the night? What can Teru fix for you? - Everything, everything's fucked. - Language. I did it. I believed, I committed. I did what you said and now he's fucking real. - Mary... - And I met someone. - Mary, that is wonderful. - Yeah? Yeah. But now I have a psycho, jealous, invisible boyfriend waiting for me in my house! How do I make it stop? - Make it stop? - Turn it off! Mary, it's your imagination. You just stop believing. No, that in there is not my fucking imagination. I mean, it was... it was nice and all. But now I have a real living man who likes me back. He likes me back! And then I just... And now I'm in the most fucked up love triangle of all time! Hey, your language is seriously harshing my vibe. Uh-huh. Help me please, what do I do? Okay, listen to me, listen to me. - Mm-hmm. - I know it seems big and real and it's scary, but it's not, okay? It's simple. The power of your mind, it's astonishing. All right? You've been committing to this figment of your imagination for over six weeks. You have opened yourself up and allowed yourself to become vulnerable, you've allowed him to become real. Yeah? - Mary... - Mm. ...did you two have sex? That's beautiful. That... Oh, that is beautiful. Okay, so, listen up. When you're ready to come back to reality and rejoin the real world, you just stop believing in him, okay? He doesn't exist if you don't allow him to. - He... he attacked me. - Oh, don't be a victim, Mary. Come on, take your power back. - Invite your new man over and show, um... - Jeffrey. Jeffrey. And show Jeffrey that he is not needed anymore. Okay? That he has no place in your world or within your mind, that you live amongst our present reality of our time and space right here on earth. Okay? So, are you saying that I just bring Brax over and Jeffrey will just fade away? - I can move on? - Yeah, that's exactly what I just said, almost word for word. Do you want to come in and see for yourself? Oh, no, no, I can't go in there. No. It's full of darkness, and the presence I'm feeling in there is, uh... ...it's not good. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, uh, don't forget. This is very important, look at me. Recommend me to all your friends. Follow me on all socials. - Okay? - I will do. Okay. Fuck it. This is my life. Oh, man. I'm in control. Okay. I'm in control. I'm in control! Go the fuck away! - You okay? - Yeah! I'm okay. Oh. Hold on. Yeah. - Nightcap? - I'm not gonna say no to that. - Thank you. - Um, let me take your coat. Oh, okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. I... Um... I know I sound really... ...drunk and cheesy, but, um... ...these past few weeks have been really fun hanging out with you. I... I think you're really cute and funny. Thank you. Me too. I can't believe I found a girl that likes my cat as much as I do. I might even like him better than you. That's fair. I love him pretty much more than anybody. Thanks for finally having me over here. Yeah. I think I might like you the best. Yeah. Ow! What the fuck? Mary! What the fuck? I think someone just bit me. What the... Where's my phone? Brax. I went to grab my phone because I realized that I left it in the car. Hello? Are you... Did he seriously take his coat and leave? Brax? Hello? It's fine. He'll call. He's not going to ghost you. No. No, he likes you. He does. Yeah, yeah, he likes you. It's fine. I'll be okay. He'll call. Yeah. Okay. I'll just... I'll just go to bed. Yeah. Mm. Brax, where did you go? Are you sure that you're ready for this? I have to do it. I know it's weird. - I just need to try. - I'm here for you, baby K. Okay, look, we do this and then we get super fucked up. Like, Lucy going down on that guy on Space Mountain fucked up. - Deal? - What? Why was that fucked up? Okay. One, you just met the dude. Two, it was that girl from math class' dad, so. - So? - So, so, you're a whore. Okay. Yeah, you're just jealous because he liked me better than you. Have some respect. He was there with his family, okay? Right. And I made it the happiest place on Earth. - Yeah. Thanks for the support guys. - Oh, I'm sorry. Love you. - We love you. - Mm-hmm. Let's just go before I chicken out. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Should we take these eddies first? - Dude, stop. No, don't do that. - I'm gonna take one anyway. Oh, this is creepy, huh. We should knock, should we knock? We can just, like, barge in. - Hello? - Just go. Hello? Hello? - Dude, stop it, you're gonna summon the dead! - Oh, God, how would that summon? "How would that summon?" Haven't you seen any scary movie ever? - Shut up. - Hello? - Jeez! - Oh, fuck. Wow! You three got some tense energy. They're here for you. No? Um, yeah, I just need some answers. They're just here for support. I'm Karen. - Karen. - Yeah, I know. I really got to change my name. Huh. I'm Mistress Eden. What can I do for you, Karen? I feel a lot of pain radiating in you. I assume this is about your sister. How the fuck did she know that? Yeah, I just need some closure or something. My big sister's name was Ruby. She killed herself almost three years ago. I just don't really get it. It's sort of like eating me alive. I can't sleep. I just want to know why, what could have been so bad that she would leave me, that she wanted to die. What made you come to me? Uh, Yelp. You had some really solid reviews. Yeah. Hopefully you'll keep your four and a half stars. And what are your names? Um, Lucy. I'm Lucy. Uh, this is... this is Peepee. It's Peter, these bitches call me Peepee, I don't... No, it doesn't. Like, it suits him though, right? Well, I'm not one of your bitches, so I'll just call you Peter. - Okay. - Lucy, Peter, please have a seat on either side of Karen. Karen, please sit across from me. Um... Is this gonna be, like, scary? You can never predict the dead. - Fuck! - You know, a reading like this, I usually charge 175 an hour. Don't worry about it. My guy's freaking loaded. - What the fuck? - Well, I was gonna offer 20% off, but in that case... It's fine, if you can help me reach her or even just fucking feel better, I'll pay double. Hmm, fair enough. So, just so you're all aware... ...there is no system to this. Not one communication is alike. I need you to do everything I ask without question. In a moment, I'm going to reach out to your sister, Ruby. That being said, sometimes, when you call upon the dead, others can answer... ...I have no control over this. You're opening up a door to the unknown. Are you prepared for that? - I need you to say "yes". - Yes. - Lucy? - Um, yes. Peter? You guys really think we're gonna meet a fucking ghost? - Peepee. - Fine. Yes, whatever. Everyone, close your eyes. Open yourself up, Karen. Spread them open like you did all last summer, Karen. Can you shut up? Allow your sister to reach out to you in any way she feels she can. Ruby, I am open to you as well. Make my body your vessel. Ruby? Are you there? Ruby, you're safe. Ruby. We're waiting for you. Ruby? Are you there? Ruby, is that you? Okay, John Edward, give us a show. I feel her. I... I feel her all over me. I'm going to count back from ten and allow the spirit to consume me. When I get to one, I want you to ask her your questions. Do you understand me? You will not be speaking to me. You will be speaking to Ruby. Yes. Yes. Ten... ...nine... ...eight... ...seven... ...six... ...five... ...four... ...three... ...two... ...one. Ruby? Is that really you? Yes. What the fuck? What the fuck? Okay, calm down. Hey, calm down. Relax. What do you mean "calm down"? Was that Ruby's fucking voice? She's a fucking ghost! - Yes, that is why we're fucking here. - Yes, I didn't think it was gonna be real! I thought it was gonna be some mental healing for K! - Not some... - Stop! Hey, you need to stop! - Fuck. Fuck. - Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're okay. Go ahead. Ruby? I need you to tell me why. We had our deal. We were gonna get old and get that farmhouse and fill it full of birds. We were going to leave her husband and drink whiskey and bitch on the front porch like grandma did. Why did you leave me like that? How could you leave me behind? She says... ...she couldn't take it any longer. Too much pain. What couldn't you take? The guilt. The consequences. Killed? For what? Killing Jamie. Who the fuck is Jamie? Jamie was her piece of shit ex boyfriend. He died like a year before her. No, Ruby. You weren't there. The police said it was like a drug deal gone wrong or something. Wrong! She never told anybody the truth. She says she was there. Ruby, what happened? Ruby, what happened? Oh. Oh, God. I can see it. - I can see it. - No, no. Okay. No. Fuck this. Fuck this. I don't need to be here. I never even fucking met Ruby, so, good luck with the ghosts and the... You guys, please... Nah, fuck this, man. That night, Ruby waited up for Jamie for hours. She was always the odd one out with Jamie and his roommates. They were always messed up on drugs. She loved him. Move. Even though it didn't make any sense. There's my girl. Where the fuck were you, Jamie? It's almost morning. I was off. You think you're in charge now? Huh? Huh? - Stop. Stop! - I don't answer to you now, do you hear me? You good? Hey. You good, you good? You ever embarrass me like that again, I'll fucking kill you. Got it? You're a fucking bitch, Ruby. Nothing but a fucking bitch to return! Quit your crying. Shut the fuck up! I fucking hate this! I don't love you, I'd leave! I would never let you leave me. - I know what you want. I know what you want. - Fucking stop! Fucking stop! Fucking stop! - No. No. Fucking stop it! - I know what you want, you want this. - Stop it! - You want this. No! Fucking... don't fucking touch me! No, please stop it. Fucking stop it! Don't hit me! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Fuck. Fuck. Ruby! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Ruby knew that he meant it. If he got in that room, he was fucked up enough to kill her. Ruby! You're fucking dead! When I get this door open, and I will, you're fucking dead! You're never going to leave me. I'm gonna kill you. You're never gonna leave me. Give me a big fucking knife. We're gonna gut this bitch! Oh, God. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. I wish I believed in God. I don't know who I'm praying to. If anything or anyone can hear me... ...please help me. I'll do anything. Just don't let me die. Please don't let me die like this. You're dead, bitch! You will belong to me. This was the first time she laid eyes on it. I don't know. What are you? Your deepest fear and your only chance. What do you want? Your mind. You serve me. You do what is asked. I am in you. I can't. I can't. When you die, try not to fuck up my floor! The next one, he's in. You agree? Okay. Okay. I... Yes. I agree. Show me. Ruby realized she was making a deal with something darker than she could even understand. I'm gonna cut you up and do things to your body you can't imagine. Good. More. Fuck! So much darkness. I see what has happened. The things it showed her... ...asked of her... Ruby had to do it. She had to die. Oh my God, that's so fucked. Ruby, I'm so sorry. It's trying to get in! I feel a portal opening! I warned you that's gonna happen! - Stop it, please stop! - I have no control over it! Ruby dying angered it! And now the darkness from this thing is dripping through like a bloodline to the weak. It sense the vulnerable and loss, the afraid among them. And it punished them for her choices! Ruby broke her deal. Now the darkness is seeping through! It was all a path to you, Karen! Stop it! The one she loved the most! Lucy, oh my God! Ruby? Oh my God, Ruby? No! I served you in my life. I'm dead. It's fucking over! Nobody called you here! Fucking go! - Go! - Not without you! You have my body, you took my life. It's fucking over. It's over! Mistress Eden, say goodbye, we have to close it. Mistress Eden. Run! - We have to go now! - What about Lucy? Not now! What the fuck is going on? - Okay, where the fuck is Lucy? - Get in the car! - What? - Get in the fucking car, Peepee! Fuck. This is so fucked. What is happening? Oh. So, um, is Lucy staying, or? - Drive! - Okay, I'm getting pretty freaked out now! Can either of you explain to me what the fuck happened in there? - Where the fuck is Lucy and who the fuck is that? - Ruby. Ruby? Not to be rude or anything but isn't ruby fucking dead? - Boo. - Oh fuck. Okay, cool. We're just hanging out with ghosts now. By the way. Really nice to meet you, Ruby. I've heard great things. Um, so, can either of you explain to me where Lucy is? - A monster ripped her face off. - A monster ripped her... There's a fucking monster now? There's always been a monster. Fuck! Karen! Baby. Where are you guys? Something else came out of the portal.
