Rachel, I want to talk to you. Mom. -We're going home. Mom, wait a minute. ...Mom. Have you calmed down, Mom? We're going home. You're nuts. Going home, eh? Where to? What is 'home'? To your paranoia? Your bullshit books? Your wacko rabbis? Why do you want me to come home? I've had it. I ran away, Mom, from you. Why is that so hard to understand? Stay here, I'll be right back. I'm here. -I know that already. Hello, Ahmed? This is Mustafa. I'd like to reserve a room. Yes. OK. I'll be there in half an hour. See you. Thanks. Hello. -Hello. There's a hotel nearby. Mustafa will take you there. But I want to stay here. I need a vacation too, right? I don't know what to do with you. Do whatever you want. Mom. Good morning. How long have you been here? I didn't sleep at all. Why didn't you wake me? -Look at the sea. There's no other sea like this in the whole world. Let's go get some rolls. -What's the rush? Can't we get a bite to eat together? OK, we'll have breakfast and that's it? And that's it. Abed, fiill the jug with water and put the things away. Thanks. I can't stand coffee. Coffee is a delight. Give me one cola. Congratulations. Thank you. Salameh sends you his regards. -Really? -Yes. How is he? -He arrived with his brother. -How is Salameh? Nagim, tell her to go away. Mustafa. Tell her to go. She's bringing shame on us and herself. Nagim, my son. Those tourist women bring us nothing but shame. The world has gone mad! She gazes at a man as if she wants to devour him. He asked for you to leave. Far away, in the mountains. Give this to him. Tell him it's from Leila. What is it? -It's from Leila. From who? -From Leila. Give it back to her. She's gone. You've had it! She gave you a gift, now you have to give her one too. Mustafa, where should I put this? -In the kitchen. Slowly, slowly. "Water goes round and round, "but it is destined to return to its source. " "God will reward he who feeds me. " Come, we must get our things. -You do. I'm going for a swim. Sit down. Let's see. This gift is for you. Jalabiyeh. -Jalabiyeh. This jalabiyeh is from a faraway land. The other way. Like this. Nice? -Yes. Put it on your head, it covers your face. Except for your beautiful eyes. Yes. You look like a married Bedouin woman. A married Bedouin woman. A married Bedouin woman. Mom, Mom. Mom, let's go. -No, I don't want to. I don't want to go, I want to stay here. But you'll dehydrate in the sun. I'm going back with you. Going back where? -Home. Let's go, Mom. The story. Don't you want to hear the story? Another time. Mom! Sit down. I told you to call Mustafa! And bring me a glass of water! I told you to sit down! If your tongue does not burn, you are innocent. Lick it. Show me your tongue. You too. Here. You are innocent. Hello. -Greetings. How are you, Father? Why did you bring the girl with you? I snatched her from the beach. I want to marry her. You are married, my son. She must go back to the beach. Choose any girl you want, but no this one. Let's not discuss it right now... -Now. Please, let's wait. -I said, now. Listen, gentlemen. Nagim snatched a foreigner and wants to marry her and make her a member of our tribe. What do you say? -No one will have her. He should take her back. Gentlemen! I asked my father and I'm asking you. I want this girl to live with us, I will marry her according to our religion. Just as a mountain does not move from its location, the Bedouin's tradition does not change. He who sells out his honor shall be punished by his forefathers. Sit down. Father, once a camel is full-grown, it is sold. Once a son is full-grown, he must be obeyed. Nagim. Do you know what you are doing? I want to marry her. Nagim, my eldest son, is humiliating me and insulting me at the purest of moments. Listen, everyone. I hope the Prophet, may he rest in peace, forgive me for my words. Father, please. I must expel him from the tribe. Father. Go, now you are exposed to the sun in the middle of the day with nothing to protect you. Go out to the desert and dry out under the sun. I am taking my money, my power and my honor away from you. You are not my son, I don't know who you are. Make coffee for our guests. Welcome. -How are you, Uncle? We would be honored to have you eat with us. Thank you, Uncle. Please. After you. Do you like the food? Enjoy. Why are you eating so fast? It's not healthy. We came from the small well, we're continuing to the mountain. Please, do me a favor. I want a camel. No problem. Thank you, Uncle. How is your father? Well, you know... Is he ill? He expelled me and degraded me. Because of her? Stop crying! Don't be afraid! You are a princess. The people will support you. The tribe and the head of the tribe support you. You will make a good wife. You will be a good wife. All the men will ask for your hand in marriage. All the kings of the world will want you. All the women will envy you. Purifiication is essential. All the wives of the prophets were purifiied. The whole world will smile at you. "In the name of the merciful Lord, "King of Judgement Day," "We are thy servants asking for redemption" "Show us the path of truth and guide us. Amen. " She is purifiied. Purifiication is a precious thing to man. Purifiication is essential. Mom, have some water. You must drink. You got sunstroke. Mom, drink. Move your hair away. Here. "And let them shave all their flesh... " -Mom. Mom, what's going on? "And wash their clothes and so purify themselves... " Mom, it's just a story. What's wrong? "To purify them, have them shave all their flesh, "and wash their clothes and so purify themselves... " What's going on, Mom? Stop it. Have some water. Numbers, chapter 8, verse 7. Nagim, Nagim. It's Leila! What's the matter? It was a windy day. I had never seen such a strong wind. And I... who wanted to return to the beach, I didn't notice when the sun rose or when it set. I didn't know in what direction to look. All I saw before me was an endless range of mountains. I'm going to get some things... No, no. You stay here. There's a spring outside, not far from here. Bye. Be careful. Are you hungry? I'm starved. Here, eat. "Life is beautiful... " Your eyes look like a spring. Dress. Welcome. How is my mother, Abu Ahmed? Thank God, fiine. Please. Your father sent me to ask you to leave this woman and come back. Come back. Abu Ahmed, I asked you and him, I want to live with her. But you insulted me. Listen, Nagim, there are many women in this world, but you only have one father. If you want another woman, no problem, but not an impure one. May God help me, Abu Ahmed. What is that? Get that snake away from here! Leila, it's over! Everything is alright. Leila, calm down. What's wrong with her? She must drink. The devil is inside her, she must drink. Make her drink, the devil is inside her. Drink. "The snake is not a female. " What does that mean? -Your wife is a snake! If you want her to live, you must purify her. Enough, Leila. Enough. Enough, Leila. Enough. Enough. What brings you here? Did you come to make trouble? Your end will not be a good one. I don't want to see you like this. What do you want? Where did you come from? In the name of the merciful Lord... You must be chaste. You enchanted the sheikh's son because you are blonde. Why did God send you to us? "Show us the path of truth and guide us. Amen. " Abu Ahmed, stop her! Enough! It hurts, it burns, it burns... It burns... Mom, Mom. It burns... Mom, Mom. Mustafa will take us, we're going home. I must go. -Mom, I don't need him. I don't want to see him. I'm begging you. Let's go home. Let's go back.
