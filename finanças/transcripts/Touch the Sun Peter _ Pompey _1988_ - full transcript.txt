[beach music] [singing] - Bye, mom. - Got your lunch money? - Yes, mam. - Coy and chips. - Sure, mom, bye! - Bye. [car honks] [ominous music] - You're the new boy, aren't you? - Yeah. - My dad said you live in a caravan. - So what? - What's it like? - I don't know, it's like a house with wheels. You don't like a place, you take off. - Wish I could do that. - Yeah. We move around a lot. [car honks] - [Older Man] Good morning, Margaret. And how you are? - [Margaret] Very well, thank you Mr. Barbuto. - And how's the mayor? - He's well, thank you too. - [Mr. Barbuto] Waiting for the bus, are you? - [Younger Boy] Bus ain't coming, Gus took sick. - He isn't coming coming, and don't forget your lunch. Do you want a lift? Gas is already spoiled again. - Twenty cents for the ride. - You must have a back like a pretzel. Sorry, mate, maybe next time. - Peter. [ominous music] - Hey, wait! Hey! - Peter. - Wait, come back! Come back, what's your name? [screams] Gosh. [scary music] - Peter. - [Teacher] Now, your exam results. Like the sacking of Rome. 47, 49, sloppy, a big victory, sincere but useless, 99 and a half, your father says you worked till 3 AM just to pass. Don't overdo it, Margaret, or you might end up like Alexander the Great. He wept because there were no more worlds to conquer. But altisima, the very highest. [laughter] - [Young Girl] Nice square head, got 99 and a half. Altisima! - Hi, Altisima! - Drop off, Wayne! - Hey, did you really get 99 and a half? - What of it? - Nunquam, like in the school motto, is that Latin? - It sure ain't German. - What about this thing, I need it worked out, translated. - Why? This would take me forever. - Please, I need it, you got 99 and a half. Look, if it's too hard, forget it. - I could do this in my sleep. - Thanks. Did you do it? - Yeah, is this your joke or did one of the seniors set it up? - No, honest. - Which book did you get it from, Pliny or Virgil? - No book. - Then where did you get it from? Suit yourself. - Who's Pliny, please? - Pliny was a Roman, he wrote Indices. But the writer of this gives his name as Pompeius Minous which could be another name for Pliny. But it really means little Pompey. - Little Pompey? - You made some mistakes when you copied it out, but it's lament, he's in exile with his father Pompeius Clutonious. - Big Pompey? - Sort of, his father's a poet. They've been sailing for many days, from Rome he says. - Where's his mother? - She died when he was born, now he's very unhappy. They're on a long journey, they're really exhausted. And so he sailed-- - [Boy Voice] Till night is day and day is night again. Thrice the moon revealed herself, and turned the shining face away-- - That took a bit of working out, thrice, three times, the moon revealed herself. Three full moons, so they've been at sea for about three months. - No wonder you got a 99. - And a half. - Where are they sailing? - They've been exiled to the end of the earth. Because of a poem, his father the Pompey's wrote this poem about Nero. - Show me. - I really shouldn't, it's for adults. - Come on, I've been around. - First I want to know where you got this stuff. - [Bus Driver] Come on, don't doddle! You tell your daddy to fix that road, them potholes are wrecking my stride. - Peter, hang on! - I have to go, my mom's waiting, see you! So the great Nero plays violin, to burning Rome, his harlots, and his kin. We cheer but we would rather boo and hiss. Earth's farthest shore seems preferable to this. Hey, hey wait! [majestic music] Hey wait, I know you're here! Please come out, my name's Peter. - Ow! - Great, just great. - Are you always this rough? Find a tomb, bet no one's ever been here. Who did you think I was? - No one, you followed me here didn't you? - Of course not. Well, sort of. You found something, haven't you? - Go away, it's my cave. - Look, maybe I could help you. I spent all lunchtime translating that stuff, it's the least you could do. - I said thank you. - Come on, what's going on, don't you trust anyone? - Swear you won't tell? How did it get here - I'll need to take it home. - No, give it back. - Don't be so rude, you'll never make friends if you go on like that. - I don't need friends. - I'll only need it for a week or so. I reckon I could translate this. - Hello, Margaret, this is Wayne. I'd be honored if you could come as my guest to the Gamma Bicentenary dance. And my dad would pick us both up, of course. It should be a great night, just filled with fun. Now you try. - It's stupid, I hate it. - You haven't got a partner. - No. - You still want that trail bike for Christmas? Well, do it, do it, Wanye, with feeling, with feeling. - Hello, Margaret, it's Wayne. I'd be honored if you could come as my guest to the- - Gamma Bicentenary dance, - and my dad will pick us both up of course. It should be a great night, and just filled with fun. - Good, good. - 99 and a half. - [Margaret's Mother] And the rest? - The same, 98, 99, mathematics 100? - I'm sorry. - That's just what you said the last time. - I can't help myself, when I do an exam the answer just comes. - My, my, Margaret, must have got it from your mom. She must have been the smart one. - Smart enough to hide it. - If you were a boy, I'd know how to raise you. Clip round the ear, and a few games of footie. Teamwork, Mic, that's what life's all about. Be just the same as everyone else. - Yes, dad. - Brains like yours, they make people nervous. Heck, it doesn't look good for the mayor's own daugther outsmarting everyone else, not in an election year. Magsie please, for my sake, you fail at something. - It could be a car, could it be a car? - Mom? - Hm? - How long are we going to stay in Gamma? - Don't you like it? - Yeah, it's okay, could we stay here till summer? [coughing] Oh mom. - We'll see, we won't have to do this forever you know. One day, I'll have a little shop of my own. In one of those little air conditioned arcades in Brosie. Connie's Espresso! - What's espresso? - Coffee with froth, millions of bubbles. And maybe you're dad will come back to us. He'll be so sick of sharing he'll want to move in. You, me, and him, Connie's Espresso! - Do you think dad ever misses us? Mom? - It's late, Peter, go to sleep. [bells chiming] - [Boy's Voice] Lbera me. [laughter] - Hello, Margaret, it's Wayne. I'd be honored if you could come as my guest to the Bicentenary dance. My dad would pick us both up, of course, it should be a great night and filled with fun. Well, say something. - I'm sorry, Wayne, I can't. - You can't, why not? - Because I'm going with Peter. - I want to see you, I hear you're going to the dance with Margaret Bainbridge. You've been here for a week and take over the town. - No! - You're not, you hear, you're not. - Try and stop me! [kids screaming] - [Students] Fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! [snoring] - Hi, Gran. - [Miria] Hi, Margie! - Hi, Miria. - How are you doing? - Want a hand? - Nah, finished, such sad little faces. Do you know they cook them alive? Still, your dad just loves them. Wants them every night when we get married. Oh, imagine me, mayoress! What's the matter, love? - Two boys at school had a fight over me. - You, my honey that's wonderful! I always said you had potential, didn't I? My favorite color, heartbreaker pink. I was wearing that color when I first met your dad. When I was cheerleader for the Ipswich Wombats. Queensland, Queensland, go, go, go! [laughs] - Thanks. [mower starting] - I want you to mow every blade, you hear me? Every blade. - Couldn't you beat me? All the other kid's fathers beat them. - No, you punched up a friend of the daughter of the mayor. You want his worship to think you're a thug? And after that, you go straight round to Peter's and apologize. - But, Dad, it's raining. - Well, that might help to cool you down a bit, son. - [Miria] We're the cover, where's the cover. That's it, turn it inside, turn it inside, no! - [TV Announcer] 30 seconds left. They must get four points, and here they come. They're going to run across to the horse- - [Miria] Oh yes, go with him, where's the support, yes! Go, go, you did it! [ominous music] - Pompeilia. - Oh, which one? - What's with the face full, you're only going to work. - Oh I never know who I might meet! - Who is he? - Now don't you worry, Frank's a cop. - A cop? - He's very nice. - So is Dad. - Yeah, he was, but nice ones slip away. I guess it's a law of nature. - What was he like? - Don't you remember? - I remember the tattoo. - Everyone said he was just like Elvis. Nice ones always slip away. - I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I hit you, I'm sorry I hit you. - [Margaret] Peter! [knocking] These Romans are smart, you won't believe what I found. This is hot Peter, really hot. - Tell me! - Wait till we get there first. We'll have to look around... and they say Latin's dull. Does your face hurt? - No. - Looks sore. - Yeah. - So this is what happens when you make friends, huh? I'll let Wayne take me to the dance. - No, you think I went through this for nothing? - See anything? - No. - This is impossible. - Well it says on the map to look for the wall of Pyramus. - Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? - Pyramus and Thisbe, they were lovers and they spoke through a wall. - [Voice] Peter. - Found it. [ominous music] What does the map say? - Seek it now, when Neptune's heart is loudest. - Who's Neptune? - God of the sea. Let's go back. - No, we've got to keep going. When Neptune's heart is loudest. - Peter, peter wait, don't leave me! Wow! [enchanting music] - SPQR, what's it mean? - Sentus Populusque Rmnus, the Senate and the People of Rome. - Rome! - It's Latin, Peter, it's a boat from ancient Rome. - This is a special I wanted to show you, do you like that? - I think they're terrific. - [Frank] Whatever you're selling, I'll buy it! - Hey, baby. - Very nice. - Well, it's yours on the house. - Oh, no I don't smoke, don't believe in it Mrs. Driscoll. No, actually what I want to talk about is my daughter and your son. - Oh there's nothing wrong with Pete, he's a good boy. - They told me down at the council that you don't have a license, but it doesn't matter. As the Italians say, quid pro quo. - Rome's a million miles from Gamma, why Peter? Why is that here? They must have been the first, the first white settlers. Peter! [scream] Wayne, you scared us to death, Wayne! - It's a boat, Wayne, a very old one. - How'd you get it in here? - It's ours so you're not to go blabbing. - I don't care about your stupid old boat. - [Margaret] Get off, Wayne. - [Peter] Hey, be careful Wayne. - [Wayne] Don't be such a sook. - Wayne, get out! - [Wayne] Lay off. I reckon we could sell this, you know? Must be from pirates, we could get a thousand bucks. - [Man's Voice] Peter, peter! - Get back! - How did you know? [ominous music] - Nero Divinus, the divine Nero. - [Wayne] Huh? - Emperor of Rome, 55 AD. - 2,000 years. - That's old alright. - That's impossible. Wayne, they're not yours. You musn't tell anyone, not yet. We found this boat, and it's our secret. - We'll swear on it, like Romans. I wear the mask of honor... well go on, say it. - I wear the mask of honor. - On my eyes, my lips, my heart. - On my eyes, my lips, my heart. - Listen. [owl cries] - In Roman times, a daylight owl meant danger. [owl cries] - Queensland, queensland, go, go, go! [heavy breathing] Queensland, queensland, go, go! - Hi, where have you been? - Nowhere special. - I hear you've been hanging around with the mayor's kid now, dad's really mad. - Did the cop tell you that? - Stay away from Margaret, please. - What's wrong with her? - Nothing, she's a lovely girl. Big house, swimming pool of her own, more things to make you feel ashamed of living here. Oh, you're too young to eat your heart out, Pete. It'll come in its own good time. [radio plays] [bell chimes] - [Man's Voice] Peter. Libera me, libera me. [laughter] - Libera me... save me. [students recite poem] - Mom says I'm not supposed to see you. - Dad's at it again. - Do you really have a swimming pool? Libera me, it means to save somebody, doesn't it? - Libera me, it's supposed to be the cry of a soul in hell, why? - I wish I knew. [ominous music] [thunder storm] - [Boy's Voice] Their hunger and thirst became our companions, our nets were empty and the sky held no rain. For mighty Neptune, the god of the sea had cast us adrift from his mercy. Then my father became very angry. - Oh gods by whom we are abandoned, spare us wretched mortals and we, in sacrifice, will burn this boat on the first shore where it lands, this I swear. - No, he can't! - Hang back. - If he burns the boat we can never go home. - What choice do we have? We're dying, Habemus, only the gods can save us. - I wear the mask of honor on my eyes-- - My lips, my heart... poor things, poor Pompey. [bells chime] - No, stop! Don't! [bells chime] - Libera me, Peter, libera me. [heavy breathing] - Pete, what's wrong? - Nothing. - Do you want the light on? - I'm okay. - Night, Pete. - Night, mom. - [Mr. Barbuto] I reckon those coins are gold, son. Pure gold, and probably stolen. So where does he get them? The truth now, Wayne. - Tell daddy the truth, and then we can all go home. - If you tell us where you got them, I'll let you play with my gun. - On the boat from Rome. - We think they're from Europe, nicked from one of them fancy galleries. Of course, we can't arrest him yet. - Arrest? - Smuggling, theft, larsony. [cries] That'll be Interpol. - What's Interpol? - [Sargent Mulwright] Sargent Mulwright. - International police. - And guttentag to you too, sir. What? What? - [Habemus] Look, over there, land! [excited mumbling] - Son, wake up, look, look. The gods have listened. - And in the morning, the call of the laughing bird-- I didn't understand that, must be wrong, greeted our arrival. [laughing bird call] - I claim this land in the name of Nero, divine and absolute master of the Earth. And in the name of the Senate and the People of Rome. I call this land Pompelia. - Is this our home now? - The end of the earth. - Look! [dramatic music] - Be careful. - We are Romans, Ro-mans. [mumbling between natives] We have been sent by Emperor Nero. [natives scream] Quick, back to the boat! - [Teacher] Get back to your class! Didn't you hear the bell? - [Sargent Mulwright] You heard me, nothing. Nothing Roman's been stolen from anywhere. Not so much as a silver shackle. He laughed at me [laughs], he said you can't have a robbery without something missing. This will get back, this will get all around the force. Okay, son, we'll play it your way. You're going to tell us all about this boat. - [Peter] Margaret? - [Margaret] Hi. - Hi, did you find out? - They went back to the boat, look it says here. We fled in fear of the black men. [natives speak] - [Boy's Voice] And here we stayed, with fear and hunger for many days. The heat was great and we still had no water. Then my father became sick with fever, shivering and crying and begging us all to honor our gods and burn the boat. [gasping] Without water my father would die. [sad music] [water splashing] [ominous music] I looked at their spears and I feared-- - I would never see my father again. - Well go on, what happened? Wayne! - Hi. - [Mr. Barbuto] Wayne, where are you? - Thanks, pal. - They had to beat it out of me, honest. - Okay, what's going on here? Peter, Margaret? - Margaret, does your father know you're here? - It can't be, good lord it can't be! - [Mr. Barbuto] What? - It's fantastic, this is amazing! - It's just an old boat. - And old boat that will make Gamma famous! Incredible, incredible, they'll have to rewrite our history books now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's a miracle, that's what it is, a genuine miracle! It's fantastic! - Oh, look, you'll have to be a bit weary of those cameras. No, I'm afraid until we speak to the media about just what's going on here, come in front of a judge-- - The mayor, or should I say the emperor, of this sleepy little hamlet is a former Queensland football star and 1968 player of the year, Mayor Leo "The Tiger" Bainbridge. - Now if this boat's for real, and that's a very big if, Rosie, it would mean that the Romans were the first white Australians, and not the British. As is sometimes alleged. - Do you think it's authentic? - Well, Rosie, as we say on the field we'll just have to see when the scrum packs down. - Wood from the boat, wood from the boat! It's genuine wood from the Roman boat! [kids playing] - Wayne's selling fake wood in the playground. - Ah, here it is, background research for my book on Pompey. - A book? - I'm going to publish his scroll. I'll have it translated by the end of the holidays. - But you can't, it's a secret. We made an oath. - It was only a game, Peter, don't you realize what this means? An authentic Roman diary, and I translated it. I'll be up there with Pliney and Virgil. - Pompey would hate it. - Pompey's dead. - Is he? Libera me, save me, what if he isn't? What if he's in hell and needs our help? - That's spooky and it's stupid. Now stop trying to scare me, I want to get this finished. - You're as bad as Wayne, I trusted you but your father was right, I should've kept away. - [Mr. Barbuto] This way, professor. - Thank you, it's very kind of you to let me stay in your house. - Oh, not a problem at all. I feel smarter just standing beside you, Prof. Now, about this boat. - It is a fraud, of course. They always are, UFOs, Holy Grail's, Trojan Horses. You know how many Noah's Arcs were found last year? 16, two in Texas, all of them genuine. So you show me this boat, and then I go home. Incredible. - Roman wares and donuts for sale, get your donuts here we go! Donuts for sale, Roman wares and donuts for sale! - No photographs without the mayor's permission, son. And no, you can't go inside. Peter, peter, come on out of there, son. That's a good boy, out, out, out, out. - [Wayne] Come on now, donuts for sale! - [Sargent Mulwright] Barbuto, get out of there! - [Connie Driscoll] Peter, peter. They're going to bring in engineers, they want to take it to town. [laughs] This will be great for business. - I found it, it's mine. - Oh, not anymore, Connie's Espresso here we come! - [Wayne] Get your donuts, for sale! [magical music] [snooring] - [Wayne] Hey, Driscoll! - Get lost. - Don't be so stroppy. Look, I'll cut you in if you like, 10% on the wood sales. Well, you did find the boat I guess, it's only fair-- - Go away, I don't want it! - Thank goodness you're here, you won't believe what I just found-- - Go away, you've got the scroll what else do you want? - You're so pea-headed. - It's my boat, Pompey gave it to me. - No one gave it to you, but I'm sorry you're angry. - No you're not, you broke your oath. - I've done more work on the scroll, I think you should listen. - Well, I'm not interested. - Well, I am. - Why, is there a buck in this for you? - Don't you care what happened to Pompey? Little Pompey was captured, but they didn't kill him. He was saved by his fair skin and his bulla. - Huh? - The bulla, it was a good luck charm Roman kids wore around their necks. Well, I guess the blacks had never seen gold before. - This bulla, it had an L inside didn't it? - Maybe, why? - Nothing, so what happened? - They looked at the gold and thought he'd come from the sun, "I was sure that I was about to die, and I grieved for my--" - [Little Pompey] Grieved for my father, whom I would never see again. [dramatic music] [natives speaking] [horn blowing] And thus did we settle on the shores of Pompey. So far from the temples and markets of Rome. And the black men taught us the ways of this land. To hunt, and to fish, and where to find water. The days were filled with wonder. With wonder and delight. [instrumental music] And so we lived in exile, here at the end of the earth. But my father found no peace, for the boat remained unburned and our angry gods did ever torment him. There was shame on us all for failing to honor his oath. Father, father! - No, no, look at me, it must be burned! - But we'll never get home. - We promised the gods or we shall be cursed. Go, I command you! Go! - [Romans] No, not the boat! - Go, go, throw it, throw it, no! [dramatic music] And so did my father die on a shore at the end of the earth. The flames burn, and all life passes. I mourn him, reader, my father who loved me. But the gods will not give back the dead. And sons are left to weep alone, pity me reader. - Pity me and pray for me. - This is stupid. - You okay? - Yeah, my dad went too. He didn't die, he just left. I write, you know, I guess he never got my letters.

That boat's about as Roman as the Pope. We've been tricked, the Gamma boat's a fake. [wind blowing] [radio plays] - All roads lead to Gamma. - [Radio Announcer] Seems a certain boat has gone up a creek and left us all there without a paddle. [cries] [screaming] - [Miria] Wee! Who's a naughty, naughty Ipswich Wombat, hm? Come on, come on daddy, just a little, little spoonful. Queensland, queensland, go, go, go. - It was just the same when he lost the grand final, didn't budge for weeks. - How's your dad? - Miria says I have to force feed. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault, they're going to pulverize the boat. - [Wayne] Good riddance, too. - When? - Today. - They can't. - It doesn't matter, it's a fake. - The wood, the stuff they sent to the unit wasn't from the boat at all. It was from Mrs. Hennesey's back fence. - What? - I switched it round, I sneaked into the Professor's room. - Then the boat's for real. - Yeah. - Quick, let's go! - [Wayne] Come on, Peter! - [Margaret] You let me destroy my book, you stood there and let me drown it, why Peter? Why did you do it? - [Peter] Can't you see what the boat's doing? It's turning the town into a great big circus. - [Wayne] What's wrong with that? - [Peter] That's not what Pompey wants. He needs help. - [Wayne] You're the one that needs help. [dramatic music] - Stop, stop please, stop you can't! - Stop, please you have to stop. The boat's not a fake! - Sorry, love, council orders. - You can't! - I'm warning you, kid, I'm on me orders. This boat's gotta go, get out of me way kid. Do you hear? - No! - Okay, kid, it's you or me job! - Peter don't! - He's going to squash you! - Libera me, libera me, libera me, libera me. - Peter, peter! - Libera me, libera me! [lightning crash] - Libera me, libera me! Libera me, libera me! - I'm scared, who is that? - It's Pompey! - Libera me, libera me, libera me! Libera me, libera me, libera me! [crashing storm] [scream] - [Margaret] I saw him, Peter, I saw him. - [Wayne] You're a weirdo, how'd you do that? - [Margaret] It was Pompey, you were Pompey. - He led me to the cave, he wanted us to find the boat. To look after it for him, but why, why? - When I was a prop forward, our coach used to say "play honestly, honesty is the best defense." It was true for the Wombats and it's true in life. So I'm going to ask you to be honest, son. Then I'm turning you over to Frank. - [Connie Driscoll] No! - Keep out of it, Con. - We all know Lenny, and he's not a drinking man. - A cyclone attacked me. - Shut up, Lenny. So, what the heck have you two been doing with my boat? - [Connie Driscoll] Nothing, Pete's a good boy. - I switched the wood shavings. - [Margaret] It was all my idea. - Magsie? - It's true, daddy, I taught him to do it. And Wayne helped, too. - No... okay, just a little bit. [screams] - Chlorine makes it shiny. - Oh, it's lovely, Leo. - Yeah, well you only get married once or twice. [phone rings] - [Grandma Agnes] Leo, Leo, there's a phone call from Brisbane, it's that professor! [whistle] - Queensland, Queensland, go, go, go! [marching band music] [crowd cheers] [siren] [crowd cheering] - They love them, they love them, you can see! [Roman music] - And in honor of those first white Queenslanders, I am proud to unveil these plans for a Roman temple and bubbler complex for the Gamma War Memorial Park. In the immortal words of Julian Caesar, "Veni, Vidi, Vici," I came, I saw, I drank. [applause] I love this boat, friends, this tiny ship which braved the oceans is just like me. Just like us, a battler on the sea of life. And because of this boat, Gamma and all who sail in her, us, friends, us, will sail on to victory. - Vulgarity, thy name is Bainbridge. - And I make you this promise, friends. I will work myself senseless, day and night if necessary, to launch the people of Gamma on this journey. I thank you.

Made from authentic Gamma water. New Gamma moisturizer! Preserve your face for 2,000 years. - [Radio Announcer] And that was Latin Lover, this week's bullet performer on 4GA Gamma! - [Wayne] Ten, twenty. - [Radio Announcer] After the break, we'll continue with hits of the ancient world. - Always keep Henry's face on the left, son. - Ten, twenty, thirty, forty. - [Interviewer] So, Wayne, in your own words, how did you feel when you interfaced with the boat. - Oh, uh, good, good and everything. Well, I knew it was there, I've been searching for years. - [Interviewer] You knew about the boat, then? - Uh, yeah, well I've had this feeling. And my dad always says, go with the gut! - [Interviewer] Mayor Bainbridge, how do you feel standing here in the very spot where the Roman boat people first came to Queensland? - Margaret-- - Dad's not here, he's out with the boat. - Well, I'm really not one for deep thinking, Jared. That's not what Queensland's all about. But yes, I think-- - It's you I wanted to see, I thought you might like to have some of my makeup, you know, for when you get older. I've been promoted, head of Avon sales in the Solomon islands. - The Solomon islands? - Yeah, isn't that terrific? - [Margaret] You're leaving Gamma? - Yeah, do you like it? - It's lovely, thanks. - Now you'll smell like Princess Di, ey? - But daddy can't manage without you. - Oh, Margaret look, as long as he's got that boat he'll be fine. He won't even know I'm gone. - [Interviewer] But the boat is a foreign vessel, and under the constitution that means that the property of the federal government. - He was some man, you know. - They'll always be a ratbag element trying to spoil the fun, now we are not going to have a bunch of left wing radicals come right wing extremists crawling all over our boat. - Look after him, Margaret. - Why are you leaving? - Oh honey, please don't, if I cry my eyelashes will uncurl. - [Interviewer] Why do you think the boat came to Gamma? - That's a good question, Jared, it took a wrong turn at the equator and ended up here. Thereby being Queensland's first ever tourist. - Pete, what do you think? - [Peter] Ours? - Ta-da! We'll never tow that, mom. - Oh we don't have to, I was thinking we might stay here for a while, huh? - What about finding dad? Connie's Espresso? - Oh, we can't leave Gamma, not now. Those Romans are not plastic, they're gold. And I've got the franchise, we're doing it Pete! We're making our fortune. - [Margaret] Miria's gone. - Yeah. - Go after her, daddy, it's not too late. You know how much she loves you. [phone rings] - Hello, yeah, Ron, that's right, America. All 55 states, and three weeks in Disneyland. Of course I'll be going with the boat, too, but there's a couple things I want to know right now. Can you check, does the boat float? - [Peter] America, they can't! - [Margaret] Well, they are. - [Peter] Where are we going? - [Margaret] To Mr. McHugh's house, I need help Peter. Something's happened to Pompey, but I can't make it out. - Amazing, amazing. Why haven't you handed this in? - We can't, please don't ask us to. - What's he saying? - Well, he's a terrible speller, just dreadful. Let me see, what heart is bleaker than mine? What eyes have seen such sights? Look, he's put the me in twice! Oh dear, dear, what a bad mistake. - Was he sick, he has a fever. - Sounds like Malaria, they must have picked it up on the way, probably Africa or-- - Please go on. - I heard the black moon call and hurried to the sea, the smoke was rising from the waves. Where the boat had been moored, now there was flames, I watched this fire and believed that at last mighty Neptune had been honored. But later I learned the terrible truth. The black men told me, for they had seen it. Flavius and the slaves had taken our boat and hidden it away in a secret place. They'd burned a raft instead, hoping this would trick the gods. [natives speaking] But the gods cannot be tricked, and they turned on us in anger. [screaming] And soon all had died, the sons of Rome. Thus I was left alone. By day I search for the boat, ever mindful of my father's command. But the hills kept their secret, and the cliffs remained bare. Then one of the black men gave me a map drawn by Flavius. [natives speaking] [screaming] - [Little Pompey] No, they'll find the boat! Set fire to it! I failed to burn it, and the angry gods wracked my body with fever. And so Pompey leaves you, pray for him, reader. Exiled on Earth and dishonored in heaven. Twice shamed, forever lost. [dramatic music] Bury them on the road in the way of our fathers, they found me in my tomb when the flames went out. Thus Pompey burns, burns forever. Save me, reader. - Save me. - Save me. [crowd yelling] - My dad says they're going to throw you in jail. - Thanks. - Here, it's a Roman raisin. - Wayne, he's on a hunger strike. - [Wayne] No one's looking. - I can't. Look, I'm not going to eat, I'm not going to drink. Passive resistance. - You're crazy. - It worked for Ghandi. - [Wayne] But that was just a movie. - You tell him from me, I'm at war with America. I'm going to stay here forever until they give me the boat. - You can't fight the Yanks, you don't even have a gun. - [Wayne] Are you sure you haven't cracked up, my dad says-- - [Peter] You saw it, you saw Pompey. You think he wants us to give up his boat? - Caused him nothing but trouble, and us. - You've done alright out of it. - Yeah, well I don't see my dad much anymore. He's always down at the factory, or with his accountants. When he does come home, well, he yells at everyone. Guess that means we've got it made, huh? - [TV Announcer] In a scene straight out of Crocodile Dundee a feisty little Aussie declared war on the US, and to prove his point he's on a hunger strike. The final ironic twist today, local boy Peter Driscoll chained himself to the Gamma senetat, as a protest against the boat's upcoming tour to America this fall, telegrams of support have been received from Green Peace and Shirley McClaine who claims that in a previous life she was actually on that Roman boat. But for now Peter's on his own, chained and hungry at the town senetat. Where he plans to stay until the boat tour is cancelled. [reporters shouting] - [Reporter] Is he a member of Green Peace, Mrs. Driscoll? - Come on, what's the matter with you people? Step back, you'd think you'd never seen a kid chained to a pole before. Alright, Connie, he's okay, don't get yourself upset. Come on, he's over here, he's alright. Maybe you can talk to him, come on step back please. - And how long do you want him to stay? Peter, oh look at you, oh goodness. They've come with a van, TV men from everywhere. Asking all kind of questions, what sort of mother do they think I am? They want me to make you come home, but what am I supposed to do? Cut the chains and drag you off, beat you? You can't stand up. That boat has made us $12,000 already. You think your dad doesn't know that? Hasn't seen us in the papers? I know him, Pete, this would bring him back. Maybe this very second he's coming here. And if you make a fuss we'll lose it all. Oh Pete, don't wreck it for us please, don't ruin our one big chance. - Poor little fella. - Let's get on with it, Frank. Come on, Frank! - No! - Come on, come on, get in the car like a good boy! - Shut up! - [Peter] Help, help! - Come on, out, out, out, come on, out. And don't do it again. - [Connie Driscoll] Peter? [ominous music] - [Little Pompey] Libera me, Peter. Libera me. [instrumental music] - [Margaret] Wayne! - He asked us for help, but we never knew why. He could never leave here, because he never burned the boat. Forever in exile, those were his words. That boat's been cursed, and so has this town for taking it. It belongs to Pompey's gods. - Mumbo jumbo, it breaks all the laws of logic. - You'll say stuff with me, and you can't even see what's going on. - [Grandma Agnes] Margaret! - Be there in a minute, Gran. - Libera me, his soul in hell, you told me that yourself. Pompey wants us to free him, he wants us to burn the boat. - No! - If you touch that boat, it's like shooty skippy. My dad was right, you have gone trouble. - Go on, agree with him, but I know what I know. We read his scrolls, and now it's like he's with me all the time. - They'll never forgive you, they'll send you to jail. - He's waited 2,000 years for me. - You'll never do it, not on your own. [instrumental music] - What are you doing up, mate? Go back to bed. - Dad? It's about the boat, Peter and Marg-- that's our moisturizer, it's supposed to be the water from the mountain spring. - Yeah, sure, I'm just topping it off a little. - But you're not a cheat. Not you. - You think I want to be a cook for the rest of my life? - For 20 years, I've stank of cinnamon and olive oil. I'll tell you what I learned from my donuts, if you don't grab the dough, you're left with nothing but the hole. [dogs barking] - I wear the mask of honor, I wear the mask of honor. - On my eyes, my lips, my heart. [ominous music] [snooring] - Quick, we've got ten seconds. Got it! Here goes. Last one. - That's it. - We won't give up, we can't. - Someone's coming! - [Wayne] Fix it. - Wayne! - Quick, get in, what are you doing here? - I wish I knew. - They don't fit. - Don't you know anything? [whistling] [car starts] - I don't believe it. - Where'd you learn that? - Miami Vice. [dramatic music] - [Sargent Mulwright] Hey come back, you're under arrest! - We can it now, we won't get caught. - Do you have the gold bar? - Miami Vice? - No, Sound of Music. - Oh no! - Ouch, my head, get off, you're on my head! - Everything fine? - Okay. - Quickest way, Wayne. - Magsie? - Daddy? - What the heck do you think you're doing? Stop, come back! Margaret, margaret! [dogs barking] [instrumental music] [heavy breathing] - Frank! - Mayor! - Who's taken the boat? - And my distributor cap, I'll bet it's terrorists. They jumped me, man, they come from behind. There were six of them, looked like tanks. - Three kids, Frank, including my daughter. - What? - Do something, quick. - Too late, they've taken it to do what must be done. It's meant to be. - Now what are you on about, mate? - The boat is cursed, the children have to do this to save Gamma, and us. - You better get us a car, Frank, any car. [whistling] - Quick, hurry! - Catch! [horns honking] - Race car, you idiot! - Okay, here we go. - Vini, vidi, vici! - It's Pompey's. - What about your book? - It belongs with him. - It's just like the bubbely, the sparks of the bubbelay! The greatest battle in the ancient world, the singers of courage! [majestic music] - We who're about to die, salute the children! - I can't. [flames roaring] [car honking] - [Mr. Brisbane] Wait, what are you doing? Hey, bring that boat back! - [Crowd] The boat, the boat! - [Margaret] Listen! - Goodbye. - [Peter] It's Pompey, he's saying goodbye. - Flames burn and all life passes, vale. - We've done it, he's free, vale Pompey. - Vale. - Vale.
