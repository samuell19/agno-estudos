Fiddling with yourself again? Just rubbing my stomach. You got a bellyache? - Yes. Poor you. Fold your hands, let's sing. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Promise always to be Mom's little darling? -Yes. Goodnight. Dear God, bless Mum and Dad. Bless Grandma, Grandpa, Ailu, Veera, and my mates. Kaarlo, Jake and Make. Protect Earth's nature and animals... ...don't let the Americans and the Russians... ...start a nuclear war. Amen. A FILM BY VISA KOISO-KANTTILA STAR BOYS Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you, Dad! Happy birthday to you! Wonderful! Thank you. Who do we have here? - You, Mum, Vesa and me. That's wonderful. Thanks. Here you are. What's in here? I don't believe it! Sauna ladle! So fine! Made this yourself? - Yes. Awesome! Thanks. You're dad's best birthday presents. The best! But you sure can't be quiet when making breakfast! I've pretended to be asleep for an hour! Waiting for you to come... Thank you. My, you're handsome. I made a lunchbox for you. - Thanks. You shouldn't have. We'll go to the Club. - Oh? You never told me. Won't have to skimp any more. I'm really proud of you. Let's buy you a car. What? - So you can drive to work. Did you hear? We'll get Mum a car. But who dares to ride with her? - Come on. You like Siiri? - Come on. You do! - Dunno. You got someone in mind. - Hell no. Anyone home at your place? - Dunno. Siiri's waiting for you. You've got your Sirpa. - Who's she? Ever seen them before? - Sometimes. What d'you think? Look at this. Is it real? What do you think? You thought it was for real? - Are you totally stupid? Dad promised this to me. Hi! - Hi. Give me a hug. How is everything? - All right. Have you eaten? - We just did. Right. Done your homework? - Yes. Have I shown you - how to clean the lens? - No. You need a brush like this. How does it feel? - Soft. It must be like a woman's hand: soft and tender, not to scratch the lens. Start from the edges. You try it. That's the way. Good. When you put this back - remember to tighten the screw. Yes. You may clean that, too. We'll use elements for everything, at least eight floors each. Cranes must have room to move between the buildings. That's not what we planned. - Now you plan it. We never talked about this. We'll have to think about it. Any way you want it. We need the drawings in January - so we can start work in spring. What about these? - We'll tear everything down. Condemn all of them. - We can't do that. That's all right. We can always find other architects. That's no problem. Martti, wait a bit. What're you up to? - What about you? We haven't got a choice. - What do you mean? Can we afford to say no? - You can't be serious. Someone will draw them anyway. - But not me. You want to bankrupt us? Is that what you want? If it comes to that. I won't be part of this. Right. Pass your plates here. Mushroom soup. - Yes. From the Muhos trip. - Your plate, Dad. Yes, from Muhos. - Looks so creamy. Just say if you want more salt. Thank you! Everything has to be so saltless these days. Thank Mum nicely. I did already. You hear me? Thank Mum nicely. Thank you! Vesa! Come back immediately! Right. This is very good. She's takes after her mother. Oh shit. - Fucking homo. Hi! May we come to sing? Sure, go ahead. May we come to sing? Go ahead, boys! Good evening, good evening to every estate here Shut up! The Star boys are singing! You shut up. You want my fist in your face? - Just give me some ass. And we wish you and we wish you A happy and a Merry Christmas See! At least thirty! We'll be rich! We'll sing in every bar! But at our place first. My folks promised us fifty. Really? Fifty? That's great. Last one there's a wanker! Fuck you! Happy birthday, Tapio! Look who are here! Right, boys! Step right in. Wonderful! You came to sing for us. Come and sing! Go ahead now. I'll give you fifty. Quiet, everyone! The Star boys will sing for us. A child is born to us a boy given to men. Through him I've found Life the favour of my God. He is the dawn of the might that will light up the world. And perhaps his tunes will echo around the Earth. Bravo! Well done, boys! Honey, bring us more wine! Your Mum's tits were almost bare. Your folks are sex maniacs... What the heck? - You just shut up. What an asshole. - Don't push them. Look at that! - Who are they? Shit, it's Henkka! - Just walk on by. What're you doing here? You got no business here. You don't own the whole town. - Yes, we do. You have to pay us if you want to pass. The hell we will. - Such a sorry bunch. Hands off! Fuck! Damn it! Fucking moron! Dammit! Give us the money or he'll get it. Let him go! - Money first. Go and cry to your mother. Are you all right? You couldn't help it. He had a real dagger. Oh shit! Our star! - Fuck. Was nice to meet you. He threw our star away. - Shit, shit. He's really sick. Everything's wrecked. Now what? Let's go to my place. There's no one home. Yeah. Who's there? - No one. I'll show you. Well, well. What's up, boys? I guess I need to go. - Me, too. Did you make good money? Bye! - Bye! Bye. - Bye. Fucking whoremonger! Get the hell out of here! Calm down! - Get out! I never want to see you again! Calm down! I haven't done anything! I just went to the sauna at Martti's place. -Don't lie! And why did you paw Ulla all evening? Guess how I felt? - We were just kidding around. Don't take it seriously. Sucking on someone's tits is not kidding around. I didn't! - Don't lie, I saw it! Come on! I've done nothing. A man can't even... Get the hell out of here! - Stop it! Get the hell out of here! - Calm down! I can't hold parties with you any more. Let go! - Calm down! I haven't done anything. Believe me. Dear God. Don't let Mom and Dad divorce. Amen. What're you doing? I don't want to see you ever again! Mother! Where did Mum go? Darling! Will you marry me? I do! I promise to be faithful - and love you until death do us apart. Come here. Oh! This is nice! Come and eat. - Right. Still play with those? - No, just tidying up. I want real food. This is real food. - It isn't. Don't eat, then. Where's Mum? Don't know. At Grandma's and Grandpa's, I guess. When will she come home? - Don't know. Are you getting a divorce? Not me, at least. Mum just wants to make a fuss about something. Whoremonger. What did you say? - Whoremonger. What's a whoremonger? Eat up. Dear Heavenly Father. Please bring Mum back, don't let her leave us. I promise not to swear or fiddle with myself again - if you bring her back. Vesa? Are you asleep? Vesa. Sleep well, dear. Wait here. I'll come with you. - No, you wait here. Morning. Morning, Tapio. Is Marja with you? - Yes. Wait a moment. Marja? Come here. Someone came for you. The children are waiting in the car. - I'm not going anywhere with him. You can't leave your family like that. Try one more time. No begging or soliciting. Come back home. Which part did you not understand? Please. I beg you. On your knees. On your knees. - Here? Right here, right now. I'm really sorry for everything. I ask you to forgive me. Mum! - What is it? Vesa said you'll put me in an orphanage. Don't you believe it. No one puts you there. Do you still love me? Of course, silly. And when I'm old and wrinkled? Of course I will. Why do you ask? Like it? It's good. - Good. That's the Andromeda Galaxy. Looks great. Do you know that we're looking into the past - when we look at the stars? - No, why? The light from Andromeda has travelled through space - for at least 2.5 million light years. Really? - Yes. Where've all the stars come? - From the Big Bang. Where did it come from? - No one knows. Grandpa, do you believe that God really exists? I guess I do, but I don't know - if it's any use. I believe, at least. That is good. Nothing doing! It's not fair... Shut up! Won't make it. - I will. What did I say. - Dumb luck. Say something to me. Why do you have to be so stubborn? Why can't you do it? We need that money. Could you just look me in the eye? I ask you. Do you hate me? What do you want us to do? Is there anything I can do? I don't understand anything any more. See you later, boys! Bye! How long will you go on doing this? We've managed well this far. And when you grow old? Quite a lot to do here. Have you considered that apartment? Everything would be brand new. Kitchen equipment, a bathtub for Tyyne. What would we do there? Sit in a rocking chair and wait for death? There're other things beside housework. You could travel. Take up a hobby. We don't need those things. Feel damned ashamed! - I only want to help them. How can you think they'd want to move into apartment? Father built this house with his own two hands! You can't just drive them out of their own home. They can't have the right. - They won't ask your opinion. Who has messed up Dad's drawings? Vesa! Did you mess up Dad's drawings? No. What drawings? - On my desk. I know nothing about them. - Look me in the eye. Answer honestly. Did you mess up the drawings? - No, I didn't. Ask Veera, she played in your office. Goddammit. We're not going anywhere! Don't touch me! Don't you drag me, you grown-up man! Get out of here! You have no right! Don't touch me! We're not going! Let him go! You hear me, brats? Let him go, now! Father! How dare you do this? - We just follow orders. Aren't you ashamed? Olavi fought for you in two wars! Please get in the car. - I'm not going anywhere! I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going. - Let me go! Let's just go now. - Let me go! You take people away from their own home! It's wrong! Sit down, please. Let us out! Stop the car! Fucking shit. Shit! Hellfire and fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! You knew this all the time. - No, I never did. Don't lie! - Calm down. I tried to talk sense into them. I suggested everything, but nothing would do. Of course not! It's their home! How could you even imagine anything like that? Besides, it's my childhood home. Did you ever think how I feel? But I can't help it. The houses will be torn down anyway. Believe me. I feel I don't know you any more. - Come on. You knew what'd happen. - I sure didn't! If I'd known I wouldn't be here any more. Goddammit, boys! That's the asshole's car. Take good care of Kaarlo. Let's handle this like gentlemen. Let go. Shit! What's happening there? Stop it. Hi, darling. We're going now. Mum must go now. - But I don't want... You'll come to Helsinki when school ends. We'll do fun stuff together. The zoo and the amusement park. I want you to stay at home! Darling. Mum has to go. Right. Mum! I'm so proud of you. You've become - such a big, brave boy. Promise to be brave - if something happens to Dad? But nothing will happen to you. Who are you, little boys as I don't know you? Piupali paupali, piupali paupali, as I don't know you? Have you come here, have you come here to get your shoes? Piupali paupali, piupali paupali, to get your shoes? Dad. What are you doing there? Nothing. Just checking that everything's all right. May I sleep next to you? Yes. I'll be there in a minute. Calm down! Don't lie! Get out of here! Shit. What now? Henkka's got to give the money back. In your dreams. He'll never give it back. We'll see. Don't go. You'll just get beaten up. Henkka! Give back the money! Hey, the pussy! - Give back the money! What you babbling? - The money you stole. Never stole anything from you. They're gonna beat him up. - Yeah. Hold him still. Hell, no. Goddammit. Let's go. You with me or not? - Sure. Come here. We've got something to show you. - What the hell? I'm not going anywhere with you. Yes, you are. Fuck. Stay there. Let me go. Not so tough guy after all? How does it feel to die young? Please don't! I'll give you anything if you let me go. Honestly. If you tell anyone - we'll kill you next time. Okay. Let's go. We won't tell anyone about this. Never. Dear Heavenly Father. Please forgive me. Don't send me to Hell. Forgive Kaarlo, too. He didn't know what he was doing. He's a lost sheep no one takes care of. Amen. What's up, Vesa? Is Kaarlo at home? He doesn't live here any more. He's with his mother in Helsinki. Oh. Vesa. You're a fine boy. For our Star Boy, Greetings Grandpa Vesa! Don't lean over! Hi! - Hi. Hi! - Welcome! Nice to see you. - You, too. So nice of you to come. Hi! Ulla, you look so good. - Thanks. You, too. Want one? - Not now. Have you ever tasted? - Many times. Yep. What's it like in Helsinki? It's bit different from here. At first everyone fucked with me over my dialect. But they stopped it. I beat up a couple of guys. Right. Well done! - Yeah. No one fucks with us Oulu people. Right. You said I won't hit it. Let's see if you will. - Sure I will. Oh, hell! Let's go. The boys are here! - Make room, boys. No, not now. Such lovely apples you got. They feel so nice. Can they even be true? Stop it! Stop it. - Just a little... Boys, move over a bit. May I whip you? - Go ahead. Throw some water on the stones, boys! Vesa! No! Stop it now! I mean it! Stop! Bloody hell! Get back here, bloody brat! Oh heck! A bulls-eye! Check and see what I got there. You got a hole there! Really, Tapio! What is it? You got a hole there! - A hole? What is it? You got a hole there! - Yeah, sure! Not bad. See what I found. Let's get wasted. - What? Let's get drunk. It tastes bad. - You got a lot to learn. Ho! As you've been brave and stroked my golden crown, I shall reward you, not with silver or gold but with a bloody mark from the tip of my sword! A cross on your chest, now my sword can rest. En garde! There's your sword! Calm down. Shit! How you gonna get out of this? Surrender? Never! Hey, honey? What is it? Come on now. Go to hell! Oh shit. I want my Mum. I'm going to faint. - You're just drunk. Get out! No kids in here! What the hell... Boys! Fuck you! Shit! - Boys! Boys! - Answer immediately! Vesa! Kaarlo! Boys! Boys, answer now! Kaarlo! Boys! Boys! Come back! Boys! Vesa! Vesa! Kaarlo! Come back, everything's all right! Boys! - Boys! Boys, come back! Come back, everything's all right! Fuck you! Fuck off! Sex maniacs! - Whoreasses! Wankers! - Cocksuckers! Hairy asses! Hairy asses!
