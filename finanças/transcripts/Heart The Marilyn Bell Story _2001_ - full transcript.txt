A minute, ten. - That's too slow. Everybody here doesit in under a minute. Try the Dolphinettes. - Wait, it's been quite awhile since I was timed. I might be better. Hold on. - Wait a minute, this is not the time. Wait a second, please. - Just this one sprint, okay? I'll be fast, I swear. - Okay, go. Okay. Go. (ticking) (groaning) 1:10, and your turns are a mess.

(car honking) - I've tried everything. The little twerpjust won't stop. (splashing) (gasping) - What're you doing? - I'm trying to beat my time. - She's been goingat it for two hours. - I'm down to 1:06. - Two hours straight? And you're not tired? Pigheaded pride iswasted on sprinting. You oughta be in distance. On my marathon team. - Marathoners get toswim all over the world. Then English Channel,the Juan de Fuca Straight and right now the club'straining for tryouts for that big racein Atlantic City. You get to set records and swim for money and meet other famousswimmers at events. - Like Florence Chadwick? - [Marilyn] Yes. Can you believe it? - No. No. You can't place in a littlerace in a pool, dear. Now you think you'rea marathon swimmer? - The best coach in thecountry wants me, mom. - I can not believeyou went down there and pestered that poor man. - Well, if he seessomething in her. - Oh and do you planwaking up at 4 AM every single solitary morningto take her to practice? Pick her up nights? Weekends? Get her to school on time. Get yourself to work. - Yes, Grace, I will. Gladly. - Fine. - We've spent millionson new exhibit buildings. This is the biggestmarketplace in the world. The greatest annualfair this century and they stay away in droves. Why? - Public relations, sir. They did a lousy job promoting. - If special events bookedanything worth promoting. - There was nothing wrongwith my events, sir. Patsy, here, justcan't cut the mustard. (laughing) - I can cut it withthe best of them. You gave me waterskiing donkeys. How am I supposed toto work with that? That would only flywith other ... like you, Myron. - Quiet. People stay athome to watch this. (mellow music) The 1954 CanadianNational Exhibition must compete with this. And win. I want a live event somagnificent it's too big for TV. Something that can onlybe seen at the CNE. A class act with star power. You two find it or you'll be picking my shoeleather out of your underwear at the unemployment office. (upbeat saxophone music) - Okay everybody, listen up. This is our newest teammember, Marilyn Bell. - Hi. - Jump in. No, no, no, no, no. Jump in. - I can't swim in this. - What? - I said I can't swim in this. - What? - I said I. Okay. Do I keep the shoes on? (guy mumbling) (splashing) (coughing) - Here. Put it around yourneck like a scarf. (gasping) Clothes drag weight. Resistance. Marathoning is overcomingresistance on many levels. From now on, on this team, you do as I say, whenI say and how I say. Okay, everybody in. Ten laps. Go. (somber trumpet music) (splashing) (Ryder yelling) (whistle blowing) Don't fight for speed. Fight for control of yourself. Make your strokes steady. Reach and pull. Reach and pull. Marathon is pacing, not racing. Slice the water. Reach and pull. Reach and pull. Reach and pull. That's it. Kick, Marilyn, come on. Kick. Two more lanes at only40 strokes a minute. (upbeat music) (whistle blowing) Marilyn? Now take off theclothes and try it. (splashing) - It's like I weigh nothing. (teammates cheering) - Okay, okay, come on. Get back at it. Go. - Dazzle me. - Roger Banister rerunsthe four minute mile. - Over too quick. (Patsy scoffing) - Just what I said. Rocky Marciano. Rematch. The title fight. - Too bloody. - Told you so. - A Barbara Ann Scott ice show. (laughing) Where am I gonnaget ice in August? - That's exactly. Where you gonna find it? Now this can't lose, sir. Think back to '33. Sally Rand single-handedly turned around the Chicago World's Fair. - This is a family show, Myron. - Yeah, but youcan't see it on TV. - That's because it'stasteless and vulgar, dummy. - Oh, stop it! What else have you got? - We'll keep looking. - Daddy? We gotta go. - Oh. - What? Honey, it's the holidays. - Gus says we can't affordto miss two days in a row. - What differencecould it possibly make? You're not racingtomorrow or anything. - The Atlantic Citytryouts are coming up and I want to be ready. - Well don't set yoursights too high, Marilyn. It'll only lead to a big fall. (exciting music) - Pace, not a race. This is not a contest. This is your onlycompetition now. (exciting jazz music) (whistle blowing) Marilyn! How many times doI have to tell you? Don't race! Joan, get the rope. (somber music) Okay? Lift. Come on, the restof you, let's go. (somber music) - This is nuts. Why are you keeping her? - I don't really know. There is somethingabout her, though. Don't you think? Call it a longterm investment. - Long, long, long, long term? (snoring) - Good practice? Good practice. (clapping) (splashing) (whistle blowing) - Marilyn. - What? I was counting. I was thinking. - Rope off. (whistle blowing) Okay, everybody listen up. Tomorrow we move tothe Port Credit River to begin the finalstage of our training for the first bigswim of the year. The Atlantic CityMarathon Trials. (swimmers cheering) (upbeat music) Okay everybody, let's go. I said let's go. (upbeat music) Come on, Marilyn, shake a leg. - Mhmm. - Come on, it's not that cold. Get in. What's the matter? - Nothing. Really. - Then get in. - I'm uh... - I'm just a little... Well, you know,there's probably some fish and stuff in there. - It's a river, Marilyn. Rivers have fish. - I'm um... - I just have troublewith creatures. - Joan. Take her over to the reeds. - But the reeds are the worst. Everything's in the reeds. - Then go home. - What? - You don't swimmarathons in pools. If you can't cut it, go home. - Okay, I'll go. - Marilyn. The reeds. - [Joan] Hurry up, Marilyn. - It's full of bugs. I can't do this. - Fine. Ryder can't stand crybabies. He'll cut you loose like that. (groaning) (screaming) - Something brushed me! (Joan laughing) It's not funny. (yelling) (laughing) - Eel. Eels! (screaming) (upbeat jazz music) (cartoon music) - You're supposed tobe finding us an event. - So are you. - That's only becauseyou can't do the job. - If you wanna lose those teeth, you just keep on talking, okay? (shushing) (newsreel music) - [Announcer] Is thisHollywood's latest sonar counter discovery? Why, no. It's American swimmingsensation, Florence Chadwick, enjoying yet another victory. This time, it's theEnglish Channel. The first woman everto swim it both ways. Showing how Flo this stillthe undisputed world champion of the water. Way to go, Flo. (dramatic newsreel music) - We've got a real peach ofa plan for you this time, Mr. McBlair. The Canadian NationalExhibition presents the first ever,world record setting, marathon swim across Lake Ontario. - It'd be the longest swimever done in the world. 32 miles as the crow flies. Much more difficult thanthe English Channel. - Now, we'd start herein Youngstown, New York. - Then finish, right here, in the lap of the 1954Canadian National Exhibition. - And you can't seeit on television. - Oh no. You've gotta beright here, with us. - I like it. But can it be done? That's a very long swim. I wouldn't want to setup something this big just to see it fail. Do you have anyone? (dramatic music) Florence Chadwick. My god, yes. Brilliant! What a great idea. - Thank you, Mr. McBlair. - God, I hope she'dbe interested. What do you think she'd cost me? (gulping) 10 thousand dollars? Canadian? - Engaging talent ofMr. Chadwick's caliber. English Channel, both ways,and the Strait of Gibraltar in the same year. For a first ever crossingof an unknown, dangerous 32 mile Great Lake swim, I don't see how you could'veexpected anything less. Let's set moneyaside for the moment. We'd also requirethe right to cancel in the event of unsafeweather conditions and we call the start time. - Sure. Is that all? - There's really just the fee. - Perhaps you'd like toget back to us on that? - No, no, no, no. If you need 10 thousand dollars I'll get 10 thousand dollars. - Well then. It was a pleasure doingbusiness with you Mr. McBlend. - McBlair. George. The pleasure's all mine. - [Myron And Patsy]Thank you, Miss Chadwick. (laughing) - Yes! Yes! She's perfect! That's the bonafide class act. We could make aworld class show. A spectacle of resplendence. A great lady meets a Great Lake. It's brilliant. Can't let this becheapened in any way. Can't have a bunch of nobodiesriding on our coat tales. Local swimmers. They'll wanna getin on this too. I need to get themout of the way. How do I do it? (foreboding music) The theme of the1954 CNE is water and as part of our commitmentto the local community, we'll be presentinga 20 mile relay race in the Taranto Harbor withthe country's best swimmers. And a prize of 500 dollars. (crowd applauding) - Come on, kid. I bet you'll be upthere next year. - But our main eventis unprecedented. We even made an exclusive deal with this country'sbest newspaper, the Taranto Telegram, to do it. During our finale ofworld class festivities, a world first. The longest marathon swimever attempted in history. Crossing the Great Lake Ontario. (clapping) Our invitational swim startsin Youngstown New York and finishes right hereat the fairgrounds. Please welcome our choiceto swim Lake Ontario first. The world's swimming sensation. The queen of waters everywhere. Miss Florence Chadwick. (exciting music) - Florence Chadwickswimming here? (crowd commotion) Oh gee. Gus looks fit to kill. - Yeah. This is insulting. It shoulda been offeredto one of our swimmers. Just because she's American,she must be better than us. - [Man] Is this all thepublicity she's getting? - [Girl] Never heard of anybodygetting so much news before. - Well, you've seen thefront page of the Tele. McBlair,thinks he can treat us like a bunch of nobodies. Well, he's gotanother thing coming. You know what we're gonna do? Huh? We're gonna winevery single place at the Atlantic CityMarathon and humiliate him. Embarrass him intoadmitting his mistake. Okay? I want Cliff, Harry, Robert, Kevin, Peter and... Allen. Qualificationswims, first thing. They'll rue theday...! - [Swimmers] Yeah!(clapping) - [Guy] Coach isright. We can do this. (somber music) Coach is right! - Gus? Can't I go to Atlantic City? - No, we're not takingany rookies this year. - Can't I just try out? - What're you, deaf? We have to win this. This race is 26 miles, Marilyn. What's the mostyou've done? Six? Six? Qualification's 10. And it's in the ocean andyou're afraid of fish, for sakes. You'll swim for my club whenI know you won't embarrass us and not one day before. (somber music) (crying) (uplifting music) - Marilyn, stop it. You can't do this. Gus will kill me ifI let you do this. - I do laps, right? A mile up, a mile down until I've done 10, right? - This is the wrong wayto make a point, Marilyn. Besides, the rules areyou need two witnesses to make this official. (fishing rod buzzing) (upbeat music) (laughing) - That a girl! That a girl! Keep at it! - Good work! Seven more to go. That's it. Keep it going. Good. - That a girl! (laughing) Told you she was tough, aye? The trick is tokeep her spirits up. That a girl! That a girl! (upbeat music) - That's right,Marilyn, come on. Keep it going. You're doing good. Keep coming. That a girl. That a girl. Way to go. Come on. Give me your hand. - Yay! I knew you could do it! - Kid, you did 10 miles. I don't know about 26,but you did 10 great. (laughing) - [Marilyn] Thanks mister. - Marilyn just qualifiedherself for Atlantic City. - She isn't going anywhere. - But Gus. - I oughta cut you right now. You know better than topull a stunt like this. What if something could happen? - Well it's not her fault youwouldn't give me a chance. - I'll get to you in a second. - I worked hard for this. I can do it. You still treat me like a loser. - Her time is as good asthe worst guy you're taking. If they get a chance,she should too. - I don't have a spotter. - I'll spot her. I'll get time off myjob to go with her. - [Announcer] And sixth place goes to anotherLake Shore Club vet at the 1954 AtlanticCity Marathon. (crowd applauding) An incredible performanceby the Lake Shore Swim Club here today, with thefirst six finishers, including the winner,big Cliff Lomsdon. Guess these swimmersjust cant' be beat today. - Where's Marilyn? Told Joan to pull her out atthe first sign of trouble. Check the infirmaryagain, will you? - It looks likeone of our ladies is unable to finishthe race today, folks. She gave it a great effortbeing pulled out of the water after 10 miles. (dramatic music) It's a tough break. They put heart andsoul into this, but sometimes it'sjust too much for them. Julia Rosenthal of Boston. Please give her a niceround of applause. (crowd applauding) - Should never let her do this. I knew it was a mistake. - And here comes ourseventh place finisher. It's... It's a lady's number, folks! It's another member ofthe Lake Shore swim team! The 1954 women's champion is, Marilyn Bell! (cheering) (upbeat music) Finishing first for theladies and seventh overall. Just 16 years old, folks. Unbelievable. (crowd applauding) - You did it. You did it. Well done. (laughing) (upbeat music) - Hold it. Smile! - Congratulations. Ladies and gentlemen, Marilyn Bell! (applauding) - How did she manage it? - She's pigheaded. Even more than you. Every time I tried to pull her, she's just get tickedand pull all the harder. I guess yourlongterm investment's just paying off a little early. - Hold it! Thank you. - Congratulations, Ryder. Looks like you found thenext Florence Chadwick. - [Camera Man] Could you puther arm around her please? - [Reporter] How doyou like Atlantic City? - [Man] This is reallyquite a victory. I haven't seen anything like it. - You sure showed me. Marilyn, I've gotan idea for you. - Swim Lake Ontario? Are you crazy? - Isn't that dangerous? Isn't that why ithasn't been done? - Why, honey? Why would you wannado such a thing? - Gus says I should. Gus says it's theopportunity of a lifetime. - [Syd] Are you sureshe can do this? - I won't lie to you. It's gonna be difficult. It's the longest swimever done in the world. I never have and neverwill jeopardize the safety of one of my kids. - Marilyn isn't one ofyour kids, Mr. Ryder. She's one of ours. - I realize that. I meant no disrespect. We can't do any of thiswithout your permission. - Isn't Florence Chadwickdoing this already? - Marilyn would betaking Chadwick on. She'd be racingthe world champion. - Does that mean she couldwin some of that money that they're offering? Would Marilyn bein the newspapers? - Who's gonna payfor all of this? The boats, the crews. It all costs money, doesn't it? - I'll take careof all the details. You don't have toworry about a thing. I would never lether do anything you both wouldn't be proud of. - I can't wait to goup against Florence. - You're not racingFlorence Chadwick. You're trying tobeat a Great Lake. I don't like whatyou said in there about doing it becauseI said you should. - Why? - Marilyn, that lake's gonnabe tougher than Atlantic City and the EnglishChannel combined. It's big enough tocreate its own weather. 32 miles of wide open water. No shelter. 10 foot swells. A crosscurrent at her lip,like moving through glue. Niagara Falls pouringthousands of pounds a minute. Four or five good-sizedrivers all doing the same, like a pot on a rolling boil. And cold. 60 degrees thistime of the year. Don't kid yourself. You do this for youbecause you want it. For you. - All I ever wantedwas to be a winner. - If you want it, I'll make sure you finish. I promise. - I want it. - Are you sure? - Yes, Gus, I am. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. (somber music) What should I say? - Nothing. Just smile. (elevator bell ringing) I came to you boys first because I know theStar's got standards. You don't go in for thatphony Hollywood the Tele's putting out. Glamor, star power, showbizcomes to new Taranto. They're treating Flo Chadwicklike she was a movie queen. Gentlemen, all theglitters is not gold. What you see before youtoday is the real McCoy. 24 carrot girl next door. - It's a nice angle but what's in it for us? - Well for the cost ofthe boats and the crew, you get the goodguy, girl, exclusive. Local kid stands up forher sport, for her country. Makes us all proud. People love that stuff. They buy papers that push it. But I don't have totell you gentlemen that. - Underdog stories canbackfire like that. - She's kinda small fordistance, isn't she? - Size has nothingto do with it. - Up against the world champ? - [Gus] She's got a lotof heart, gentlemen. - [Suited Man]But can she do it? - Sir, I know you don't know me, but if you ask anybody who does, when I make up my mindto do something, I do it. I'm no quitter. All I need is a chance. We did it! We did it! We did it! What? - I told you notto say anything. - I'm sorry. - You were terrific. Now you gotta deliver. - [Announcer] The 1954Canadian National Exhibition opened in Taranto yesterday with the usual pompand circumstance.

"Defends Canada's honoragainst Yankee star." - Way to go, Myron. - You started thatwhole Yankee star. - I didn't drop 10 Gs tobe savaged in the press. I can't have my greatest event dragged throughthe mud like this. - Mr. McBlair, what, if I may, what if we let thekid try out the lake? How far is she gonna get? She's 16, she has no experience and we have gotFlorence Chadwick. She swam English Channel. - Sir, there's no way she's evengoing to pose a threat to Flo, let alone, come closeto the finish line. We look generous. Accommodating. - Hm. Yes. We'll come out of thissmelling like a rose. (somber music) - Well this is it. Welcome to the Corina. Jack, this is Marilyn.
