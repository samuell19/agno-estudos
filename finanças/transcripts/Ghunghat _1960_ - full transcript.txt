Gangaram. Have you put tea in thermos or not? Yes, madam. - Good. Ok, mother, shall I go now? - You are leaving.. ..without having your breakfast? Come and have your breakfast. I have prepared Kachoris for you. Come. I don't have the time for breakfast. Ravi will come at 7 O' clock. - Let him come. He will also eat a couple of them. Come. Come. You are such a nice girl. Ganga, bring hot Kachoris. Sit down, dear. You shouldn't go out with empty-stomach. I have also prepared Kheer for you. Now have a couple of hot Kachoris from my hand. Ravi is here. I am leaving. Lakshmi, at least have your breakfast. - I am too late. Lakshmi.. - My college mates will scold me. Tata! This girl is such a.. Ganga, bring a box. I am coming. Why are you shouting so much? I thought that princess is still sleeping. I am sleeping and you are awake? - Yes. Mister, you are three and half minutes late. What did you say! - You are always late. Miss, have a look at the watch and then talk to me. Look here. Just look here. It's only 3 min. and 14 seconds. Your watch is lazy just like you. I am lazy? Miss, just look at yourself. You didn't even wash your face. Last night meal is stuck on your face. Mother's watching. You deceiver! - Thanks for the compliments. You are here, son. - Greetings, aunt. God bless you, son. Lakshmi, I have put the Kachoris in this. Mother, I don't have a place for that. Give it to me, aunty. I have a lot of place. - Ok, son. Ok, mother, tata. - Ok, dear. Be careful. You don't worry at all. "This is the weather of life and this climate is mesmerizing." "Come, let's turn these moments into lovely gardens."

What are you doing! - Daddy, do not disturb me. I am thinking about Lakshmi. You will keep on thinking about it.. ..and someone else will take her away. Madam has given Ravi and Lakshmi so much freedom.. ..as if they are about to get married. - What! Lakshmi and Ravi's marriage? That will never happen. Lakshmi is in my hands. - You fool, only the photo.. ..will be left in your hands. I have been dreaming since many years.. ..that some day Lakshmi will get married to you.. ..and their property worth lakhs will be ours. But today I felt like Ravi will shatter all ours dreams. Ravi? I have a plan for Ravi. - What's that plan? It's a simple plan. Ravi himself told this to me.. ..that his father is a very old-world man. I will write a letter to that old man that Ravi is.. ..getting married to a girl of another caste. See what happens then. - What are you staring at? Write the letter right now. - Right now? Yes, right now. Come. - Daddy, my fish. If you want to save your son and your reputation.. ..then find a solution for this immediately. Your son is.. ..about to leave you and marry a girl of another caste. Did I bring him up to see this day! What's the matter, Thakur Bishan Singh? What happened? Ten years ago I promised to my late friend at his deathbed.. ..about my Ravi's marriage and today my son is about to.. ..get married to a girl of another caste.. ..and live with their in-laws. - In-laws? Then stop him immediately. Or else Ravi's life will be ruined. If you want to save your son's life.. ..then write a letter to him and call him here immediately. And get him married where you have decided.. ..to get him married. I will have to do something like that. We must cut the evil from its roots. - You are absolutely right. Now take my son-in-law for example. Ever since I brought him to live in our house.. ..he stopped working at all. He is enjoying a jobless life at his father-in-law's house. Now I have thrown him out of the house.. ..and told him not to show his face till he gets a job. Mr. Thakur, the man who lives in his in-laws' house.. ..doesn't have any respect or dignity. Father, now you take rest. But first of all give me that pan. Here father. What happened! Who's that? - Father-in-law. Ram Swaroop, what are you doing here? Father-in-law, actually I lost my 5 rupees.. ..so I am searching my money. - 5 rupees? Yes. - But how did you get those 5 rupees? Saroj, did you give that money to this lazy person? No, father, I didn't give him any money. Ramswaroop, come in. You come in. Shall I come in? - Yes, come in. Now tell me did you have the money.. ..or did you come to ask money to Saroj? Tell me honestly. - Shall I tell you honestly? Yes. - Father-in-law, someone picked my pocket. Really? You are the one who picks others pockets and now.. ..you are telling me that someone picked your pocket? You traitor! I told you repeatedly not to come.. ..to this house till you get a job. Get out. Now get out. - I'm leaving. Give me 10 rupees. - 10 rupees? - Yes. Do you think that I have a machine of printing notes? Why don't you try to understand it! My pocket has been picked. Where will I eat now? Go to hell. - Father! Dear, you do this all the times. Ok, take this. But remember one thing, don't come to this house.. ..till you get a job or else you will regret it. - Ok, fine. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Father, at least you would have let him have dinner. Dear, whatever I am doing I am doing it for your welfare. If I don't be strict right now then he won't work.. ..for the rest of his life. Shall I bring some food if you hungry? My hunger to see you is more than my hunger for food. Dear, come near me. Come. You are looking so beautiful. What are you doing! What if father sees us! What's wrong if your father sees us! We are married. I didn't elope with you. Saroj, after thinking for a long time I came to a conclusion. What's that? - That a person should only love.. ..but never get married. - Why so? Marriage brings the burden of responsibilities. We have to do a job! Then we have to earn for the family! Then we need to bring all the requisites for the family. The teenage love is so special. There is no worry to bring rice or wheat to home.. ..nor we are afraid of anyone. We meet each other.. ..away from everyone's sight. We sing love songs. We just enjoy life.

"It brought a new color to our lives." "It brought a new color to our lives." "Our eyes came in contact." Mr. Ravi. There's a letter for you. - Letter? Whose letter is it? - My father's condition is very serious. They called me there immediately. What happened to him all of a sudden? - I don't know. He wrote me last week that he's well. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Come, sit down. No, Lakshmi. I don't have time now. I can catch the train tonight. I am leaving. Listen. I will be very worried. Give me a call when you reach home. Ok, I will. Excuse me, is this your Attache? - Sorry! Is this your Attache? - Yes. When does the train reach Allahabad? Tomorrow at 10 O' clock in the morning. Are you going there for the first time? - Yes. There's my friend's sister's marriage. And where are you going? - Lucknow. Do you live there? - Yes. I study in Delhi. My father's health is in poor condition. That's why I'm going home. And where's the Banarsi sari. Bhola, that merchant didn't bring the Banarasi sari yet. Go and call him. - Ok, sir. Father. - Ravi, you are back? God bless you. - What's all this, father? And what was that letter about? - That's all fine. Son, you came from such a long distance. Come inside and have something to eat. - But.. I said come inside. Now ask me what you want to ask. Why did you send that false letter? Because I wanted to call here immediately. - But why? Tomorrow all of us are going to Allahabad. Allahabad? What for? - Because tomorrow.. ..you are getting married over there. - Marriage? But how did you fix this marriage without asking me. When we fixed this marriage you didn't even know.. ..how to speak! How could I have asked? - But father.. I can't accept this marriage. - Why can't you? Because the city-girls made you blind? - Father! Shut up! I know everything about the girl who made.. ..you a Romeo. - Father, you are accusing a decent.. ..and well-cultured girl. My accusing that decent and well-cultured girl.. ..hurt you that much whom you hardly know since a year. And it didn't bother you at all to insult your father.. ..who looked after you like a slave for 26 years.. ..who worked in the piercing sunlight and rainy days.. ..and kept you like a Lotus? Don't you feel sad to humiliate such a father? Do you value that girl more than you value your father? No, no, father. Why are you saying so? I didn't mean that. I was just saying that.. ..I promised that girl that I will marry her. If I ask you the same question that why you promised her.. ..without asking me, then you might say that.. ..hey, old man, I am not your little Ravi anymore.. ..who would follow your orders. Now I am young. Now I am independent. No, father. For God's sake don't think so. I'm still the same old little Ravi for you. I am the same Ravi. Then why did you promise her without consulting me. I thought that my father who never said no to me.. ..ever since childhood will not say no to me now as well. I promised her trusting your love for me, father. I promised her because I know that you would sacrifice.. ..anything for your son's happiness. That's why I promised her, father. That's why you promised her? - Yes, father. Ok, then, go and marry her. - I knew it, father, you'll approve. But you will have to pay the price for this approval. Price? What kind of price? - A very big price. Ravi, come here. Do you know who he is? - Yes, he's a friend of yours.. ..who passed away. - Do you know how he died? No, father. With this gun. - With this gun? But this is your gun. Yes, it's my gun. This is the matter of those days when I was interested.. ..in hunting. A poor man was my hunter. Once he fell prey to my gun accidentally. While dying he was worried about his daughter. At that time I promised him that I will get his daughter.. ..married with my son. Ram Singh, today I am helpless, friend. I can't keep my word. Because my son wants to marry someone else. But Thakur Bhishan Singh's promise can't break.. ..till he is alive. Ram Singh, before my promise is broken.. ..I will sacrifice my life. - Father! Your promise will be fulfilled, father. Your promise will be fulfilled. - Ravi, my son! Gopal! - Manohar! Wow! Your arrival made me so happy that I can't express it. Did you think that I will not come here? That's not the thing, but I used to wonder that you became.. ..such a big doctor, and how you would come here.. ..leaving your practice in Massouri. What are you saying! Is our friendship that weak! And tell me one thing did you get the sweets on time? No. No. There is time for the marriage. Come and see the bridegroom. You are already feeling shy? Show me your face. Your bridegroom is here. Parvati. Parvati, come. Mother, give her your blessings. Her husband should always be with her. And she should lead a happy life in her in-laws' place. Chants! Wait a minute, Mr. Priest. The marriage can't take place yet. The bride's brother hasn't given the complete dowry. What are you doing, uncle! I already told you.. ..that I will pay you the remaining money.. ..within six months. - Go and tell that to someone else. Dowry doesn't run on credit. - Save my grace for now. I promise I will pay that money within six months at any cost. Please don't play with my reputation here. If you really worried that much about your reputation.. ..then you could have got her married to a beggar's on. If you wanted an educated bridegroom who has a.. ..government job, then you should have also had.. ..the price ready with you. There are many matches.. ..are who are ready to pay me 5,000 rupees more. Did you get me, Manohar? - Just 5,000 rupees.. ..isn't everything, sir. A person's humanity ..is more value than that. A brother has so many dreams about his sister's marriage. What's there that he hadn't had done for her! Please don't ruin someone's life, someone's happiness.. ..for a few rupees. - Go away, mister. Don't give me a lecture about humanity. I spent 30,000 rupees for his studies. Who will pay that money? - Listen to me, Manohar.. ..if you pay me 2,000 rupees cash right time.. ..then this marriage will happen.. ..or else we will leave this place right now. No, no, uncle. Please don't do that. We will be ruined. If 2,000 rupees is the price of your goodness.. ..then I promise you, I will send you that money. Everyone makes promises, but no one pays the money later. I have seen the world more than you did. Show your suit and boot to someone else. I have seen many people like you. Get up, Deepak.. Let's go. Get up. What are you staring at! No, uncle. Please have mercy on me. If not on me, at least have mercy on my sister. If you leave you will be ruining her life. Please don't punish her for my mistake. Go and act like that on stage. You will make good money. No, uncle! Uncle! Manohar. Get up, friend. - Gopal. There is nothing to get upset about. The people whom you were sending your sister to.. ..has proved themselves to be animals at the right time. Assume that your sister's life is saved. - No, Gopal. Her life is completely destroyed. She is ruined forever. You don't know it, Gopal.. ..this is the worst day of our lives. A brother can't see such a day. Have courage, Manohan! Have courage! There is no problem in this world which doesn't have a solution. Such a problem doesn't have a solution.. ..in this society and this world. I am telling the truth, my Parvati's life is ruined forever. Now no one is going to marry this unfortunate girl. No one will marry her. No one will marry her. Manohar, if that's the case.. ..then I am ready to marry her. I will marry her. What! - Yes, Manohar, if you don't have a problem.. ..then I am ready to marry her. - No. This can't be true, Gopal. My Parvati is not that fortunate.. ..that she would get a husband like you. Please don't make fun of me. - Do you think I will make.. ..fun of you during such a moment? I am telling the truth. "I don't feel good.." "..my beloved one didn't come yet." "I don't feel good.." "..my beloved one didn't come yet." "I don't feel good.." "I have seen your intentions." "Your promises are all lies." "I have seen your intentions." "Your promises are all lies." "I am suffering with your memories." "My eyes became drenched." "My eyes became drenched." "I don't feel good.."

"You aren't ashamed of your mercilessness." "Why did you forget me, O tormenter.." "..after going to the foreign land?" "..after going to the foreign land?" "I don't feel good.." "You have taken away my peace." "I don't feel good.." Manohar! Manohar! Manohar! Manohar! Manohar! Parvati. Parvati. Manohar! Sheela. Sheela. Manohar! Father! Father! Saroj, father-in-law went to Ravi's marriage alone? No one told me about it? When did father go? He is right here. - Here's here? Why are you worrying! Finish your meals fast. Saroj. - Father-in-law. - Father! The door is closed. - Escape from this way. Saroj. - Yes, father. Shall I serve the meals? No, dear. Ravi and everyone else is returning.. ..from the marriage. I am going to receive them. Why are you going that way? Go this way. Dear, it's been many days since I bathed. I feel like taking a bath and going there. What's the need to bath? You will catch cold. No, dear. I will heat the water. You don't worry at all. Go and bring the towel for me. - Father. Father, listen to me. You will fall ill. - Dear, you don't worry about me. God will take care of everything. Is water there in it? - No, father, there's no water. Ok, then, I will start the tap. You start the fire. This is such a tight tap. You are staring at me. Go and start the fire. Where's the matchbox? - Father, the matchbox.. ..is not there. Go and bring a matchbox from the market. Father. Father. Father. Father, stop it. The water is boiling. Go away, dear. I am in a hurry. You are irritating me. Father, you will finish the entire kerosene. - Go away. Father, stop it. Enough, father. Enough. Father. Uncle, there some bad news. - What happened? The train in which Mr. Ravi and everyone was coming.. ..met with an accident. Our elder sir died.. ..and many guests also died. - O God! Saroj, let's go there. - Yes, father. Come fast. Ravi. Ravi, my son. - Uncle. Where did you leave my brother? - Uncle! Don't worry, son. Don't worry. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Mr. Thakur went to bring such a daughter-in-law.. ..who sent him away from this world. Sister, she is not a daughter-in-law, but she is a devil. She devoured her father-in-law and the other guests. Rajjo's mother, did you come here to console them.. ..or to blame the daughter-in-law? What's her fault in it! Daughter-in-law, don't get bothered about what they say. Saroj, take her inside. - Ok, father. Sister, why are you upset? The society always.. ..blames one or other. Even if it's not anyone mistake.. ..they will still blame us. You don't get bothered about them. You just take care of your home and your husband. I wonder what he thinks about me. - Who? Brother Ravi? He won't get bothered about what people say. When you will meet him you'll say how good my brother is. Ok, now remove your tears and control your heart. Mother. Gopal, you are back? - Yes, mother. You didn't even inform me about your coming. Since I heard about the train accident.. ..I was worrying about you. What's the matter? What have you done to yourself? Where is your luggage? - I lost everything in the train, mother. In the train? You were also there in that train? - Yes, mother. My dear, my son, I will never let you go alone. I will offer inunctions to Almighty right now. Nandu! O Nandu! Bring Pede of 1.50 rupees. Gopal is here. - Ok. Manohar. What happened? Is Manohar fine? You went to his sister's marriage, right? Then why are you crying in front of his photo? I guess he is not there in this world anymore. - What! What are you saying! - After marriage Manohar and.. ..his sister were coming with me in that train.. ..but both of them died in an accident. How unfortunate her bridegroom must've been.. ..that he devoured the brother and sister after marriage. A few grooms are very unfortunate. I am that unfortunate groom. - What are you saying! You got married and your wife passed away? How did this happen, Gopal! How did this happen! Come and sit here, mother. I will explain everything. Saroj. - What happened now? I am.. - Nothing to worry, sister-in-law. Such kind of feeling is common on the first night. ..the heart beats faster, but they eyes search.. ..the beloved one all over the places. Look at me. Are these eyes waiting for your beloved one? If this is how you will behave then brother Ravi is be ruined. "O beauty, don't hide your face behind the veil." "This is the night of making eye contact." "O beauty, don't hide your face behind the veil." "This is the night of making eye contact." "Don't look at me.." "Don't look at me with anger." "This is the night of smiling and giggling." "Why are you blushing tonight?" "This moment doesn't come everyday." "Your dear one is about to come to meet you." "The flowers of your heart are about to blossom." "Your beloved one's eyes will ruin you." "Your will quit your shyness today." "Your heart is somewhere else." "Your eyes are wandering." "Don't go away from me." "This is the night of meeting your beloved one." "O beauty, your face.." "O beauty, don't hide your face behind the veil." "This is the night of making eye contact." "Stay mum for tonight." "Don't reveal your heart to your beloved one." "If he flirts with you then turn around." "Don't fall for his words." "You don't how these men are." "They are very smarts jerks." "He will request you, he will salute you.." "..but ask him to get lost." "This is the night to show attitude." "O beauty, your face.." "O beauty, don't hide your face behind the veil." "This is the night of making eye contact." "Don't look at me with anger." "This is the night of smiling and giggling." Come in. Come in. Come in, brother. Saroj is a very naughty girl. I guess she had troubled you as well. Sit down. You were wearing such a long veil during marriage.. ..that I couldn't see your face. Now remove your veil. You might have already seen me. How could I have seen you! - Why? When the other groom and his family left I fainted. If you hadn't had mercy on this unfortunate girl.. ..then my brother and I would have committed suicide. What did you say? Your brother? Brother Manohar. Now look at me. Do you recognize him? What happened? - Since the accident my head aches.. ..continuously and I feel as if I am forgetting everything. Who I am, who you are, I don't remember even your name.. Parvati. What is happening to you? I don't understand what I should do. Everything is becoming dark. - Then you take rest. I will tell Saroj to call the doctor. There is no need to call the doctor. I will go to him personally. Uncle. Uncle, I made a grave mistake. What happened, son? - Uncle, that girl is not my wife. What! - I am telling the truth, uncle. I brought some other girl after the train accident. But how did you that? - By her talk. She isn't Thakur's Ram Singh's daughter.. ..she doesn't even know me. - O God! How could this happen, son! What will happen now? That's what I am worrying about, uncle. She is a girl from a decent family. If she knows that she went to other man's house.. ..due to shyness I fear she may commit suicide. Now you tell me what I shall do, uncle. You did the right thing by not telling her. You did the right thing. - Uncle, you will have to help me. Yes, son. I am ready to do whatever you'll ask me to do. I am going to search his brother and husband. But if people know about it, then it will be an issue. You go to Delhi with Ramkush Saroj and Parvati. - What! Yes, there is a small rented house of mine. You stay there and till then I'll search her family. - Ok, son. But uncle, even Ram Swaroop and Saroj.. ..should know about it. - Don't worry about it, son. No one other than God, you and I can know about it. We will leave by the morning train. Father. - Where did brother leave at night? He had some work, dear. - What such work, father! There was some urgent work. That's why he went there. Sister-in-law, did he tell something to you? No? He is asking about the bridegroom's address. Not only in this locality, but no one in this city.. ..knows his address. He was Manohar's friend. We don't know who he was, where he came from.. This marriage happened in such circumstances.. ..that no one had a chance to ask the groom's whereabouts. If you don't have any objections.. ..may I open his house and check it.. If I am fortunate then I may get a photo of him. Why would we have any objection? Manohar always used to give keys to Kaka. Kaka, open the house. - Come. Search the house. This is Manohar's room. This is Manojar's mother's photo.. ..and it's his mother's photo. We can't see any other photo here. Is this Manohar's photo? - Yes, it's his photo. Excuse me I want to give this advertisement in your paper. Also print this photo along with that. Ok, fine. Brother, you are back? - Yes. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. O sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. What's the matter? - Your beloved one is here. What's that reaction! My brother came from such a.. ..long distance. He has to get fresh. He has to change his dress. Who will help him with that? I am very busy. - Why are you making excuses? Are you busy are you are upset at him? Why would I be upset? - I understand everything. You are upset with him because he left you alone.. ..on the first night. - Don't trouble me. Sister-in-law, shall I tell you something? Anger won't be of any use for a lady. To win one's husband anger or attitude won't help you. Only service can help you. If you want to win your husband.. ..then always stay close to your husband.. ..with some excuse or other. Did you get me? Now go. Go! Go! No. No, Parvati, you shouldn't do all this. It's wrong. Why? - Because I think one should do his own work.. ..as much as possible. What's the matter, sister-in-law, so did you meet your.. ..beloved one? - Shut up! Why should I? You must have talked to him at least a little. Nothing. Sister-in-law! Tell me at least something. Don't tell me, sister-in-law. Even I won't tell you anything. She's very clever. Keep it there. Ok, give it to me. O dear, Saroj. - Coming. What's this? - I got a job. Job? - Yes. - Who is so dumb in Delhi.. ..who would give you a job? - Foolish lady, dumb people.. ..don't live in Delhi. Everyone is a clever person. The manager whom brother Ravi asked me to meet.. ..with his recommendation letter.. ..hired me immediately after reading the letter.. ..and then gave me 50 rupees. - 50 rupees? Yes. And I brought the first sari for you with my first earning. Sari? For me? - Now you will have to become a Delhi-girl. Your Bareli shirts dresses won't work here. Wear it for me. You are looking so beautiful. What are you doing! What if sister-in-law sees me! So what! You are my wife. Father is back. Father-in-law, did you bring the vegetables? - Yes. Ravi, when did you come? - Just now, uncle. Ravi, thank you. Thank you. You gave a solid letter. The moment that manager.. ..read that letter he gave me a job immediately. Job? You got a job? - Yes, father-in-law, I got a job. And it's such a great office. You will faint if you see it. Really? - Yes! There are such large windows.. ..there are many electric fans. And father-in-law, there are.. ..workers even for bringing files and for bringing water. Father-in-law, there is dearth of nothing. But brother Ravi, there is dearth of one thing. What's that? - There's no cot over there. If they give us.. ..a cot then it will be great to sleep there under the fans. Son, do one thing. - What's that, father-in-law? Tomorrow I will come to your office along with your cot. You can sleep there and I will also sing song for you. Very good, father-in-law. Very good father-in-law. Very good, father-in-law! Very good, father-in-law! You fool, the office is a place where you work.. ..but not a place where you could sleep. Father. You can fight with him later. Have your meals first. Meals? Today I came back from work. I am very hungry. Excuse me, father-in-law. Come, son. Let's have dinner. It's enough. What are you doing! It's alright. Let it be in the plate. But why should we waste the rice like that? The rice won't go waste, brother. Sister-in-law will eat in that plate. - Parvati? No. No. Why would Parvati eat in this plate! Brother Ravi, you don't know women like eating.. ..in their husband's plates. They are old thoughts. I don't like them at all. Ok, sister-in-law, goodnight. My life is stuck in strange difficulties. I wonder when this puzzle will be solved. When you are doing good for someone.. ..then why are you worried about such small problems. I am not afraid of problems, uncle. - Then? I pity this lady. She's so innocent. How could her destiny play such games with her! Son, I wish God makes your wishes come true. Yes, uncle. I wish she gets her husband back.. ..and she lives her life happily with him. That is all I want. That means brother Ravi didn't sleep in the room last night. Did he talk to you after marriage? Saroj, I think I don't deserve him. I think I am not good enough for him. That's not the thing, but there is definitely something wrong.. ..in Ravi's eyes. He can't see the beauty in you. Sister-in-law, is brother upset with you? I haven't done any such thing. Sister, you never know these men. Even if it's not our mistake, they get upset when they wish. Sister-in-law, do one thing. - What? Ask him directly why he avoids you. I would ask him only if he sits beside me for a moment. He even runs away from my shadow. I have a remedy to that too. - Father is not at home. And my husband I will go to watch some play. Then even if stays in the balcony or even if goes.. ..upstairs, don't leave him till you win him over. Saroj! I am getting late to office. - Coming. I will tell him and make all the arrangements. Listen. God bless us. Today you are laughing and coming. Why dear? Don't you like my laughter? No, no. This is not the case. When a woman laughs.. ..then a man's pocked is picked. Really. How? Like this. This means, she wants a blouse. What are you doing dear? This means, she wants a 'Sari'. But I couldn't understand the reason for today's laughter. Look dear. Today you take me along for watching drama. Hey. When did you get this interest? Why don't you understand dear? Then make me understand. This is the matter. - Yes. Get aside. 50 paisa. Happy. Now you can go. Hey. Get in queue. Oh God! This is a long queue. If I stand in this queue.. ..then it will take one hour. And I am job to do. Hey. Why are you fighting? Stand in queue. You idiot. You do your work. - Oh shut up. You shut up. - Shut up! Alright. Mr. watchman. Please do me a favor. Get in queue. Hey. Why are you pushing? Showing me knife. What is the cost? - 25 paisa. I want 3 tickets. Quickly. Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Give me 2 tickets. - But you asked for 3 tickets. Then give me 3 tickets. - Here it is. 6 Rupees. - Here is your money. Money! - Yes. Oh God! Today is a lucky day. Always show me such days. Hey. Today is a very bad day. Is this your father's tickets.. ..and your father's money? Is this your father's tickets? - No sir, your father's. Yes, it is my father's. - Come on, give it to me. You go and ask him whose money this is. You go and ask, if you want to ask. I won't. Get aside. - Give me my money. Even a deity will be enticed by this beautiful face.. ..then there is no question of brother. I feel as if I should kiss you. Hey, sister-in-law. Saroj, where are you? Yes. Hey Saroj. Come fast, it is time to leave. Where are they going Parvati? To watch drama. - Drama! Hey Ram Swarop. - What is it? You are going alone to watch drama. Yes. Today we want to go alone. But why? - This is a secret. I can't tell you. Hey. Wait. Just listen. I came here to take you to the drama. What? Friend, why didn't you say so before? I have even bought the tickets. No problem. We will go there and sell it to someone. Or I will give you the money. - Ravi, you are great. You are great. Saroj.. Saroj. Saroj.. Saroj. What to tell you? Today my work is done for free. What happened? - Ravi is going to show us drama today. Oh God! You are a fool, dear. What have I done? - You have spoilt everything. How? Oh God! "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "If someone falls in love, then this world hates it." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "If someone falls in love, then this world hates it." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "One day I met a lover boy on the way." "One day I met a lover boy on the way." "He started saying that he loved my eyes." "I didn't realize that the world was watching me." "And I started singing in excitement." "The world started scaring me and making rumor." "I ran from there, saving my life." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "If someone falls in love, then this world hates it." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "One day I met a handsome young man." "One day I met a handsome young man." "He started saying that I was more beautiful than the moon." "I didn't realize that the world was watching me." "And I started singing in excitement." "The world started scaring me and making rumor." "I ran from there, saving my life." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "If someone falls in love, then this world hates it." "Don't fall in love. This is a cruel world." "One day I met a unique man on the way." "One day I met a unique man on the way." "He started saying that his heart was lonely with me." "I didn't realize that the world was watching me." "And I started singing in excitement." Taxi! I don't see any taxi here. You wait here. I will check that side. Taxi! Taxi! Ravi! - Laxmi you. Greeting mother. You are in Delhi and didn't inform me. I have come today Laxmi. - But for so many days.. ..you have neither informed me nor written letters. After all, what is the matter? Is your father well? I didn't want to trouble you by giving you the news. He is.. dead. Oh! I am very sorry, son. I was telling Laxmi, that there must be some matter.. ..therefore you didn't write letter. Come on. Let's go home. You look very tense. Not now. There are few people with me. But will you come tomorrow morning? - Yes. Come early. I will wait for you at breakfast. Alright. - Do come, son. Yes mother. Alright sister-in-law. Greetings. Wait Parvati. Nothing. I am feeling giddy by sitting in the.. ..closed theatre hall. Therefore I feel like lying in the open. You go and sleep. Alright. Come. Let's go down. - No, no. I like to get wet in the rain. But.. why did you.. come here? Go. Go. Go down.. or else you will fall ill. If you hate me so much that you don't even want.. ..to see my face then I will stay here, you go down. Because of me, why did you give yourself so much pain? Hey. What are you doing? If I made a mistake, then forgive me. Alright. I will come down. Get up now. Gopal. Come. - Son, have tea. Mother, I forget to tell you one thing. Tonight I am.. ..going to Delhi by train. So pack my luggage. Delhi. By train again? All trains don't have accidents. Alright. Then I too will come with you. What will you do there for one day? I was thinking of taking a bath in 'Ganga' river. I know mother. I know. No matter what, I will surely go. And that's final. Alright dear, alright. You come too. Pack your luggage with my luggage. Are you happy now? Wow! See how the darling son is sleeping. Hey, get up. It is morning. Get up, Ravi. Oh my God. He is having fever. He is burning like iron. Someone come soon. He is having 110 degree fever. Saroj. I will get the medicine and then go to the office. Alright. - Take care of Ravi. There is no need for me to take care. There is one present to care for him. - Hey, even then.. No, nothing else. It was nice that God gave poor woman.. ..a chance to be with her husband. You just watch. In this fever all their quarrels will be resolved. Is it so? - Yes. Then I too should get such a fever. - Shut up. Alright. It should not happen. It is 9'O clock. - Don't get up in this fever. I.. - Today I have to go there. It is very late. Is it really necessary to go in this fever? Yes. If I don't allow you to go, then? - Parvati. You don't know what you are doing, Parvati. I know very well. Because of fever I come close to you.. ..again and again. Therefore you want to go away from me. Isn't it? But I won't let you go in this condition. Parvati. - Yes. You hate me. You don't talk to me. I won't say anything to you. I don't ask for love. I don't ask for happiness. But it is my right to serve you. I just ask for this right. Don't take it away from me. You can take everything else if you want. What right you have on whom, this you don't know Parvati. I.. how can I explain it to you, that whatever.. ..you are thinking is wrong? I don't know what is wrong and what is right. I just want to know what is my fault, that.. ..you hate me this much. It is not your fault. And I don't hate you Parvati. Then why do you keep away from me. If I tell you something, will you believe it. If I don't trust you then whom will I trust? Then listen. Whatever I have done till today.. ..has been for your own good. I am doing this so that your future life.. ..will be full of happiness and joy. The destiny which is playing a cruel game with our life.. ..I am fighting that destiny for you, Parvati. And if you are innocent and I am on the right path.. ..then one day we will surely win with this destiny. And on that day you will understand what I said. Till that time have patience Parvati. Till that time, trust me. You care for me this much. Now I don't want.. ..anything else. Hey, Ravi. Come in. Greetings mother. God bless you son. - Hello. She is very angry with you. She didn't eat anything.. ..since morning. - Really. No problem. I will appease her. Alright. Sit son. I will send tea for you. You are really very angry with me. What are you reading? Oh boy! Oh boy! Women in love. There must be a trick written in this book.. ..for appeasing the person who is angry. Let me see it. Oh! Such anger! Hm. Alright then. Come on Ravi son, a palace where there.. ..is no hospitality shown towards a guest.. ..is no better than our poor little hut. You have made me miss my breakfast. Now you want me to miss my lunch. Does this mean that I am given invitation for lunch? Thank you. But the doctor advised me against eating. Doctor! Why? What happened? The doctor said that I have fever. You really find great excuses. Let me see, where the fever is? Hey. You really have fever. Why didn't you say so, before? There was not one to listen. And I don't like talking to walls. I am sorry. Come on. Sit here and rest. I will call the doctor now. If you had fever, then why did you come? Wow! You are really great. The justice of beautiful girls is really strange. If I come then also I am guilty and if I don't come then too.. ..I am guilty. Save your poem for later. Now sit comfortably. Laxmi. - Yes. Nothing. What is the matter? You look little lost. Not at all. - There is something. What are you.. ..hiding from me? No, no. There is nothing to hide. I am stuck in a minor problem. I want to tell you but.. ..then I think that I will just bother you by telling that. And there won't be any benefit. Alright. I you think I don't deserve to hear it.. ..then don't say. - Oh no. I said that you will.. ..get unnecessarily worried. I am hopeful that it will be solved in 2 - 4 days. Then I will tell you the whole thing. Now give me a smile. Come, come. - Ok, Ok, Ok. I think you are an honest man. At least you have.. ..given me the right address. You are an honest man. Sir, I was born honest. But yesterday only.. ..I made a mistake by mistake. - Never mind. Never mind. Will you have tea? - Its strange. You have invited me for tea only and still asking. You wait. I will get tea for you. - Alright. Alright. Saroj.. the tea drinker is here. No chair to sit. What kind of people they are? Good morning madam. Good morning. Hey, no answer. She insulted me. Ravi. You are here. I mean you are here. Brother. You have entered the wrong room. My room is there. Come. I am sorry. I am sorry. This is your wife's room. This is your wife's room. Your wife is very beautiful. I mean to say that your wife is very beautiful. The way she left from here.. She is not my wife. She is brother Ravi's wife. Oh, never mind, never mind. I thought she was your wife. You mean Ravi is married to her. No, no. She is married to Ravi. I thought Ravi was married to her. - No. You mean Ravi is married. Ravi got married long before. Ravi.. Very good news, very good news. I will see. I am saying son that there should be no delay in wedding. Nowadays no one cares for such old traditions. There is no need to think son. You just say 'yes'. And I will arrange for everything. What are you thinking Ravi? - Sorry. Let him think madam. If he needs little time to think.. ..then we should give him time. It is no good.. ..to force a young man into marriage. Maybe he has some problem. - No, no. It is not like that. I don't have any problem. I was just thinking that.. ..if few more days.. Alright. We too would need a month or so for.. ..making the arrangements. After all your wedding.. ..won't be done in such a hurry. It will be a grand wedding. Alright mother. I will go now. - God bless you son. Who is it? Oh. Ravi. I am sorry. Watch where you are going. - Watch. I have watched everything. Thank you very much Ravi. Thank you. Manager, you start the work from today. - Yes madam. Hello father. Hello.. hello. Come, Ladle. You have come on right time. I am always right. I mean I always come on right time. Son, prepare the guest list. And don't leave.. ..anyone's name. Or they will complain. But what for? I mean what is this invitation for? For Laxmi's wedding. - Wedding. Wonderful mother, wonderful. Son. You make all the arrangements and.. ..I will do the wedding next month. Next month! But I can't marry next month. I don't have leave. Hey stupid. This is not your wedding. But is Ravi and Laxmi's wedding. What! With that cheater. Ravi is already married. Stupid! I am not stupid. I am telling the truth. If Ravi does second marriage then he will be arrested. What is this nonsense? Mother, believe me. Ravi is cheating you. He is already married. - Really son. Yes. Lie. All this is lie. If you talk like this then.. ..I will remove both father and son from this house. But this is the truth. I have seen his wife.. ..myself. She is in her house. Are you speaking truth, Ladle? Let's go Laxmi. We will check it out. I don't want to go mother. I know my Ravi very well. If you don't trust him.. ..then you can surely check. But after that, these both won't stay in this house. I agree. I mean, I agree. Mother, you come with me now. I will show you his wife. Sitaram. Get madam's shawl. There she is. Check properly. This is Ravi and that's his wife. You go and see for yourself. Greetings mother. Who is that girl? Is she your wife? I will tell you later? What is left to say later? You have ruined the life of my daughter now.. ..do you want to ruin her life too. Shameless. Cheater. Mother. You are misunderstanding me, mother. You are misunderstanding me. - Shut up. There is a limit to everything. Today only you were talking.. ..about marriage with Laxmi. Madam thought of you.. ..as your son. And you wanted to bite her like a black cobra. I am not, what you are thinking. I.. I.. How can I explain it to you? This is all a game of destiny. I have never betrayed.. ..you mother. Never betrayed you. Trust me for God's sake. Stop telling more lies, Ravi. You have married.. ..a girl secretly and kept her here like a thief. And there you want to ruin the life of my daughter. Mother, just listen to me. - You cheater, you killer. Is there no shame left with you? What about your shame? Don't you feel shame.. ..talking in front of a wife about her husband's love affair.. ..with your daughter. Parvati! It is a sin even to see the face of such a person. Let's go manager. Mother. Mother. Listen to me. Please forgive me. Forgive me. I couldn't bear when you were insulted. Get aside Parvati. Get aside. You don't know what you have done. Sister-in-law. Have patience, sister-in-law. Have patience. Everything will be better soon. I am feeling suffocated Saroj. Nothing will be better. Sister-in-law. Don't cry. Now I know why he hates me so much. He married me because of pity. But he loves.. ..someone else, Saroj. I have come in the way of his love. What should I do, Saroj? Sister-in-law. All this is a lie. All this is a lie, sister-in-law. This is not a lie, Saroj. This is the truth. No, no. this can't be true. This can't be true mother. Tell me, this is not true. - This is true daughter. This is true. Laxmi! Daughter! Someone call the doctor soon. Ramu. Go and call the doctor immediately. Son Ladle. Pick her up. Doctor. When will she regain consciousness? Don't worry. She will be up after some time. She needs complete rest. Doctor, she can't get rest in Delhi. If you agree, then we should send her to Musorie. She will get peace and rest there. This will be the best. You should take her immediately. Alright. I will take her to Musorie today. Greetings. - Greetings. Where are you going like this? - To see Laxmi. Laxmi is ill. - Ill! What happened to her? What do you have to do with that? You just tell me, what you want with her? Manager. You people have misunderstanding. I am here to talk to her and clear her doubts. Oh. You are still not satisfied. Manager. - You are here to play new tricks. If there is any shame left, then leave immediately. Or else you will be thrown out. I will go. Sitaram. Give her this letter. - Give this to me. This is a really bad thing. - He married someone else.. ..and loves someone else. Let him go. I will fix him. Ravi. Ravi, come out. - What is it? What is this joke? - Joke! My life has become a joke. Shut up. Aren't you ashamed? You are educated.. ..and still you do such things. Ram Swarop, you don't know anything. So please keep quiet. I don't know. Whole world knows about your drama. You have a wife and you are preparing.. ..for your second marriage. Aren't you ashamed? Answer me. I say, answer me. Why are you staring at my face? Say something. Do you want me to tell everything? - Yes. Do you want me to raise the curtain from this drama? - Yes. Then listen. This Parvati.. Ravi! What is this stupidity, son? In your emotions, you have forgot what is right.. ..and what is wrong? - Uncle. Son, did you forget all that I explained to you. Uncle, you don't know what is happening here. My life is getting ruined. Nothing will be ruined son. Nothing will be ruined. Come here with me. Sit comfortably and then tell me everything. Dear Laxmi. The woman whom mother has seen taking care of me.. ..is not my wife. 'She is an innocent woman who thinks..' '..I am her husband, after the train accident.' 'I am trying my best to find her husband.' 'When I find him I will return to him his wife.' 'But if she finds this out before, then she will commit suicide.' 'That is why, I couldn't say in front of her.. '..the truth to your mother. And took the whole blame.' Sister-in-law. What is this madness? Fights between husband and wife take place everywhere.. ..but the relationship doesn't break because of it. Saroj, he is not my husband. He is not my husband. What are you saying, sister-in-law? Yes Saroj. Till today I was leading a life of a lie. This is not my house. No thing here belongs to me. Saroj, I don't have any right to live in this house. I don't have right to live in this world. Get away from my path. - No sister-in-law. Father. Father. What happened, daughter? - Father, sister-in-law left. Where? - I don't know. She was saying that he is not my husband. Uncle. She read my letter. - This is very bad. She will commit suicide. - Suicide. No. She is drowning. She is drowning. Why did you save me? - Lie down daughter. Lie down. You should have left me to die. What is the matter daughter? Did you have a fight.. ..with your husband? - Husband! No. no.. No problem. We will take you to your house. House. I don't have house. There is no place left for me.. ..in this world. There is no place for me in this world. You don't have anyone. Will you come with us, daughter? 'Parvati!' - Let's go. What is your name daughter? - 'Parvati!' I am Jamuna. - Jamuna. Ok. Oh. I am really fed up. He has really made mess here. Jamuna. You only tell me. Do you think I can do all.. ..this work in this old age? Gopal should get married now. But who will explain.. ..this to him? I am tried from telling him to bring.. ..a daughter-in-law in the house. But this boy doesn't listen to me. Mother, you let it be. I will do it. I am really tired of him. Either he will make paintings.. ..or read books all day. He doesn't care about his mother's feelings. Alright son. As long as I am alive you can do.. ..as you wish. But after that who will do the work. Mother. This photo.. This photo.. Keep this photo locked somewhere, daughter. Whenever Gopal sees it, he gets unnecessarily upset. I am tired of this photo. - Why? Whose photo is this? This is photo of Mr. Manohar. He married his sister. Married! Then where is the daughter-in-law? That is a long story. While returning there was.. ..train accident and she died in it. The day he married her, that same day he cremated her. Is this called a marriage? Give this photo to me Jamuna. I will hide it somewhere. No mother, no. I will hide it somewhere. I will keep it away from everyone's sight. Alright. First finish the work. "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "Today I have met my darling." "Today I have met my darling." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "After a long time I met the support of my life." "Today I have found my lost ones." "After a long time I met the support of my life." "Today I have found my lost ones." "Sometimes I feel happy sometimes I feel shy." "Sometimes tears fall from my eyes." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "Today I have met my darling." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "Give me jewelry made of stars and sun." "Someone make me a bride." "Give me jewelry made of stars and sun." "Someone make me a bride." "I don't have control on my heart." "It is the magic of my darling, that I became mad in love." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "Today I have met my darling." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." "My anklet is making a melodious sound." 'Hey, why did you stop? Go and tell him that..' '..you are Parvati. He thinks that you are dead.' 'Go and tell him that you are alive. Go' This is not right mother. I will say again mother. It is not right to keep this girl, Jamuna in the house. Why is it not right? - Oh. How can I explain to you? It is wrong for a married girl.. ..to stay in other man's house. Wrong for whom? - For Jamuna. The whole world would doubt her. Her own husband would doubt her. He will be a stupid to doubt such a girl. It is not stupidity. It is man's nature to doubt. Tomorrow when we will find her husband.. ..and when he would know that she was in this house.. ..with me, then he will surely doubt her. No man would keep a wife in his house, in this situation. This is the rule of the world. I don't accept this rule of the world. We have to accept mother. If your own daughter-in-law.. ..would have stayed this way in someone's house.. ..then wouldn't you too have doubted her. Would you have accepted her? Why would my daughter-in-law stay like that in other's house? She is not my daughter-in-law; she is a poor destitute girl. What do we have to do with this right and wrong? Alright. As you say mother. 'If your own daughter-in-law..' '..would have stayed this way in someone's house..' '..then wouldn't you too have doubted her.' 'Would you have accepted her?' 'Why would my daughter-in-law stay like that..' ..in other's house?' 'If even they doubt me, then..' Show me the way God. Show me the way. You have brought me to my house. Don't.. ..take away my shelter again. The world can doubt me, but you know everything. Help me God. Let me stay under the shelter.. ..of my husband. If I can't stay here as a daughter-in-law.. ..then at least let me stay here as a maid. I don't ask for anything else. I don ask for anything else God. "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" "They are far away in spite of being so near." "They are far away in spite of being so near." "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" "It is hard to see anything in the dark." "No star shows the path." "Don't know where the destination of hope is." "Don't know where the destination of hope is." "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" "Who is aware of the faith of this light?" "Whether it will extinguish or burn for whole night." "Who is aware of the faith of this light?" "Whether it will extinguish or burn for whole night." "Whether it will become flame or smoke." "Whether it will become flame or smoke." "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" "They are far away in spite of being so near." "They are far away in spite of being so near." "Oh! The helplessness of a human!" What is this? Where are you going with this luggage? Anywhere. But away from this city. Son. I can understand your problem. But what will you achieve by wandering.. ..here and there like a mad person. But what is left in this city, uncle? There is no news of poor Parvati for whom.. ..we went through all this trouble. And God knows where they have taken Laxmi. I don't know. Without her this Delhi is a ruin for me. I can't stay here uncle. I have to go. Hello. Yes sir. Doctor. Laxmi's mother is on the phone. Hello, greetings. Doctor. Laxmi's health has deteriorated. She doesn't even take the medicine you gave her. Really. These girls increase their problem a lot. Actually. There is no need for medicine.. ..but we need to explain her. No, no. Don't worry. I will come there soon. Daughter. Take this. Take the medicine. I don't want any medicine. I don't want! I don't want! Daughter Laxmi. If you won't take medicine.. ..then how will you get well soon. I don't want to get well mother. I don't want to. No daughter. This stubbornness is not good. Oh. If you bother me like this then go now.. ..and jump from a mountain. Laxmi, Laxmi. Ganga. Ganga, stop her. Leave me. Let me die. You are going to die. - Yes. Alright. Go. Yes, yes. Go and die. But do you have to jump from the mountain to die. I can tell you an easy method here only. I don't need your advice to die. Who are you to give me advice for committing suicide? Who called you here? - Laxmi! Don't talk to doctor like this, daughter. I have called.. ..him here for your treatment. I don't need any treatment. I don't need any doctor. You think you are doing a brave thing by trying.. ..to commit suicide. Listen Laxmi. Let me explain you one thing. Doctor, don't explain me anything. Just go from here. You just know to give advice. You are happy. How will you come to know of others sorrow? Who told you that I don't have any sorrow? Laxmi. In this world, show me one person.. ..who has no sorrow in his life. The difference is that few weak people like you.. ..cry because of sorrow and few people.. ..smile till their last breath. Doctor, when the heart is on fire then it is hard to smile. You are talking of fire. Why should a person be like.. ..a fire which burns everything around him? He should be like the fire of a lamp.. ..which gives other light by burning. A lamp can give light to others. But an unfortunate girl.. ..like me whose whole life is full of darkness of grief.. ..how can she give happiness to others. There is nothing left in my life. This is your illusion, Laxmi. Your life which you think is in vain and want to end.. ..this same life can give happiness to millions.. ..if you want. I can bring happiness in someone's life. I! Yes you. If you want. How? Come at the window with me. I will tell you. Get up. Do you see that incomplete building? Do you know what it is? - No I don't know. It is a hospital of blind people. People who are left.. ..with only darkness in their life. They need you. If you want you can bring.. ..happiness in their life. But what can I do for them, doctor? Mother said that you are a good dancer. Is it true? Yes. But.. dance! Laxmi, we need million of rupees to complete.. ..this building which we don't have. If you do a charity show for the hospital.. ..then it will be great help. Million of blind will give you blessings. No doctor. I can't dance. I can't dance. - Why not? This will not only help them, but you too would.. ..realize that your life is not in vain. It is of use to someone. Laxmi, if you bring happiness in the life of million of.. ..helpless people, then your life too would become happy. You would have peace in your life. These eyes. What all scenes do the eyes show? Sometimes it makes you laugh.. ..sometimes it makes you cry, and sometimes the eyes make you mad. What all scenes do the eyes show? What all scenes do the eyes show? The eyes have a pink thread. The eyes have a pink thread. If you see in fun, then becomes drunkard. If it breaks then it becomes a trouble to the heart. If it breaks then it becomes a trouble to the heart. The eyes drive away the sleep at night. The eyes drive away the sleep at night. Sometimes it makes you laugh.. .. sometimes it makes you cry, and sometimes the eyes makes you mad. What all scenes does the eye show? In a moment the eyes becomes stranger. In a moment the eyes becomes stranger. It becomes untruthful to us. Eyelids curse the eyes. Eyelids curse the eyes. The eyes aim the target so well. The eyes aim the target so well. Sometimes it makes you laugh.. ..sometimes it makes you cry, and sometimes the eyes makes you mad. What all scenes the eyes show you. What all scenes the eyes show you. Staying in this world and did not see the world, what kind of compulsion is this? Somebody give me eyes also and fulfill our wishes. Constraint is a big thing in life, they got darkness in light. They count their days without a patron, they count their days without a patron. The eyes make you wander and to stumble.. The eyes make you wander and to stumble Sometimes it makes you laugh.. ..sometimes it makes you cry, and sometimes the eyes makes you mad. What all scenes the eyes show you. What all scenes the eyes show you. Today the Palav is very good. Who has made it? Jamuna has made it, who else. Is it? Jamuna, how much you work, alone? How will we repay you back.. ..for whatever you have done for us? To work in your own house, there is no need of payment. Mother, since this girl has come in this house.. ..she has changed the whole structure of the house. Now you understood? If there is a woman in the house the house becomes heaven. That is the reason, I always tell you to get married. After marrying, you should be happy, even that is a kind of luck. What is the guarantee of this that after marriage.. .. you would get a daughter-in-law like Jamuna? Why will we not get? That is the reason I pray to God daily. Enough, you always keep praying for your happiness. Pray for her this poor lady also, so that she gets her husband back.. ..and she stays with him happily at his house. I do pray for her also son, but God knows when this poor lady's luck will strike. I feel bad for that unlucky guy mother.. ..whose wife is like a goddess.. ..and he is unaware from her helping nature character. Hello, can I come inside? Oh! You? Salutations mother. Long live son. How come you forgot the way and came here? We thought, daily doctor comes to our house.. ..so why not we will go to his house today? Oh! It is nice. Come, come sister. Today you have sanctified the poor people's hut. Live long daughter, live long. Come, come. Please sit. Salutations. Live long daughter. Hey! The house is very beautiful. Doctor, you have nice paintings at your house. Yes. He is mad about paintings Go upstairs and see how many paintings he has made. Doctor, you have painted all these? No, it is just a hobby. I just scratch lines zigzag. Do you call them as zigzag lines? Let me see, where are those paintings? It is upstairs. It is upstairs? Then why are we standing here? Come let's go on the top. Don't get scared, I will not rob them. Nothing like that, come, come. Go, go. Ladies first. Oh, thank you. Very nice. Daughter-in-law, where are you going? Yes, nowhere. Guests have come, arrange some sweets for them. Okay, mother. What to tell you sister. I can never forget your gratefulness. Your son has given my Laxmi a new life. After a decade I am hearing her laugh. Gopal is also concerned about Laxmi. He was getting ready to go to your house. He was very impressed by seeing her dance that day. Sister, Laxmi is the one who should be praised. She is your daughter only. Why not. Believe me, since Laxmi has come my house has enlightened. Actually sister, it is a too big house. Without daughter-in-law it looks empty. When I see them together, I think, how nice couple would they make. Sister, ghee and sugar in your mouth. If a daughter-in-law like Laxmi comes in this house, what else I want? Did you hear that Jamuna? What mother? She is talking about Gopal getting married with Laxmi. What! Jamuna, Jamuna. What happened to you? What happened to you? Gopal, Gopal. What happened mother? She got struck to the lamp. Jamuna, Jamuna. Mother, she has fainted. She is injured severely, take her on top. Nandu, Nandu, come here a little. Nandu, lift her a bit. Move mother, I will lift her. There is nothing to worry mother. She will be okay very soon. I am feeling very bad, we have created a new problem to you. No sister, why do you think like that? You have brought such a beautiful girl to our house. I am sorry. Your photos are left in between. No problem. I will come to see the photos some other time, if you permit me. Of course, of course, you are always welcome here. What are you talking dear; this is your house only. Okay sister, we will leave now. Let's leave. Bye. Bye. No, no, no. What son, is she conscious now? If she would become conscious then she would have trouble. So I gave her an injection, by which she would be unconscious for 2-4 hours. Sir, you have got this letter. - Letter ? Manohar, mother Manohar is alive. Manohar? Yes mother, our Manohar. Parvathi's brother. What? He is alive? Look at this letter. He is reaching Missouri today. Now where are you going? I am going to the motorcar stand. He would be reaching. Gopal, Parvati. Is there anybody at home? Manohar! Gopal! Hey brother, where are you? Gopal. Manohar, Manohar. Gopal, at last I came to you. What happened to your eyes Manohar? Nothing. I met with an accident. But seeing you happy, I am not worried about the eyes. You reached safely, right? Yes, but where did you go? I searched you everywhere. I got a hurt on my head and I was swept away in the ocean. Some villagers helped me and kept me with them for many days. As soon as I was able to walk and roam about, I came here. You did a great job Manohar. You did a great job. Why there is so much silence in the house. Why can't I hear anybody else? Hey brother, where is Parvathi and where is mother? Mother, mother is upstairs. Come let's go up. Come let's go. Come here. Parvathi. Mother, see who has come? Salutations mother. Hey! Salutations mother. What happened? Manohar, what happened to your eyes son? You can get treatment for eyes also, but this is a happy news that his life is saved. Mother, our Manohar was swept away in water. Villagers saved him. Tell it slowly son, she will wake up. Who will wake up? Parvathi? Where is Parvathi? What happened to her? She is not Parvathi son. She is Jamuna. Jamuna? Gopal who is Jamuna? No one Manohar. She is a sad destitute girl. Mother has made her as her daughter. Gopal, you get Manohar downstairs. I will make tea and snacks for you. Come Manohar, let's go downstairs. Gopal, I did not hear Parvathi's voice. Isn't she at home? No. Has she gone out somewhere? She is not in Missouri Manohar. Then where is she? You come downstairs. We will sit and talk. Manohar, don't get scared, I will get your eyes treated from a famous doctor. Gopal. Is my Parvathi there are not there. My swear to you Gopal. Don't lie to your blind friend. My Parvathi is there or not there? No she is not there. Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Please become conscious. Come let's go down. Come let's go. Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Come let's go down. Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Listen to me Manohar. Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Listen to me Manohar. Become conscious. Become conscious Manohar. Don't become mad. Be brave, Manohar. Be brave. It was God's wish. Why was God's wish something like I would have died and she would be alive? I sacrificed all my happiness to her, couldn't I give my life to her? At least once God would have asked me. Why doesn't he ask me? Sit down. Why doesn't he ask me? Sit down. Okay Gopal, I will leave now. No Manohar, I will not let you go. You can't go from here. I will get your eyes treated. I don't was to get treated. I don't have my Parvathi in this world. What will I do seeing the world? Let me go Gopal, let me go. The wrights that you have on Parvathi, you don't have any wrights on her husband. Gopal. Parvathi is no more, but she has left a relationship tie between us. For the sake of that relationship, I tell you Manohar, this house is Parvathi's till today. Gopal. I need you for sharing my sorrows. I need you Manohar. Gopal. Dr. Gopal. I don't guarantee you that with operation his eyes are going to be okay. But then to, I will try. Okay, doctor if you have time, then do the operation right now. Okay, then sent the patient to the operation theatre. I will get ready. Nurse. - Yes doctor? You take him to the operation theatre. - Yes doctor. Come let's go. Okay Manohar. Hey Jamuna, just see whose call is it? Tell them, doctor is not there at home. Hello. Doctor is not there at home. Jamuna, I am Gopal speaking. What is the matter? The matter is nothing; just tell mother that Manohar's eyes are getting operated. I will come a bit late. Manohar? Who is Manohar? You don't know him, just tell mother. She knows everything. What? Hello, hello. Who was it Jamuna? He had called up mother, I mean doctor's call. What did he tell? He told that Manohar is getting operated. He would come late. Okay. Mother, who is this Manohar? Hey, the same Manohar, Gopal's friend, whom we used to think.. ..in accident he also would have died along with his sister. Mother, is he alive? He is alive, but he has lost his eyes. Poor guy has become blind. Gopal has taken him to his hospital. Jamuna, where are you going? I, potato, potatoes have finished mother; I am going to buy them in market. So, why do you want to go? Send Nandu. Nandu? Nandu is not there mother. I will only get it mother. Okay. Get it fast. Where is Manohar? I don't know. Where is Manohar? Who is Manohar? The one who got operated now. Has the operation finished? Yes finished. His eyes are okay now? Not now, after 10 days when the bandage is removed then we will come to know. Where is he? See there, they are getting him. Who are you? I, that.. Jamuna, how come you are here? Who, me, I have come to you. Why, what is the matter? Matter? Matter is nothing. I just came to tell you that, give me a job as a nurse in your hospital. Nurse? What will you do becoming a nurse? Here so many helpless people come, I will look after them. You know a nurse's job? I know to look after them. I will look after them. I always have very little work at home. It becomes over soon. The rest of the day goes waste. Doctor, can I finish my house work and can I come here? Okay dear, okay, but why you want to plead so much? If you feel satisfied by looking after the helpless people, then come down. I will tell mother also. Nurse. Yes doctor. This girl whenever she comes, whomever she wants to help.. ..let her do. Okay doctor. Now you are happy? Come let us go doctor. Look here, you first want to help him. Sit here. As soon as he gets consciousness, tell me. Yes, if he asks for water, don't give him water. There ice is kept. Give him a small ice cube. Are you having pain? Shall I massage? What do you want? Water. Water, water. I will get it right now. I will get it right now. Take. Is it paining badly? Pain, how much will it pain. I have gone to the extremes of pain. Who are you? Me? I am a nurse here. Oh! Your voice resembles my sister's. I feel sometimes as if my Parvathi is sitting next to me. For some time think me as Parvathi, brother. Long live, long live. Laxmi, again the same sadness. No, not at all. I am not sad. I was thinking, if I tell doctor that.. ..I have collected 32000 as funds, he would be happy. You can cheat the world with your laugh, but not your mother. Mother, I am not cheating you. I am trying to keep you happy with my whole heart. If you really want to keep me happy, then why don't you listen to me? Daughter, Dr. Gopal is a nice guy. Mother. Again you started talking about marriage. I laugh for you and sing for you, that is more than enough. Please don't force for marriage. My heart doesn't agree. You have mistaken me. I am treating that girl. I don't have any plans of marrying her. You mean, doctor who treats the patient, cannot marry her. I can, but I don't have any intentions. Why don't you have intention? Till when will you remain trapped.. ..with these old bones and this routine Gopal? If not about you, at least think about mother's happiness, son. For your happiness, why do you forget that what will Manohar think? From this marriage, why you want to put salt on his wounds. Mother, forget this matter. Take, drink the medicine. Thank you sister. Brother, from so many days, I want to tell you something. Me? Tell me what is the matter? Brother, I am in a big confusion. I want to tell you my story and take solution from you. Yes, yes sister, tell me what is the matter? Destiny has played a big game with me brother. By fault I am staying with a stranger man thinking him to be my husband. But how did this misunderstanding happen? It is a matter of those days brother, when after marriage.. ..I was going in a closed litter, then.. Then? In a dense forest, it became night. That night there was a strange tornado. In that tornado we all separated from each other. And wandering I went off into another marriage hall. Then? The person who was not my husband, I thought him as my husband. Hey! Then did the bridegroom also think you as his bride. Yes, some days even he had the same misunderstanding. But brother, God saved me from being sacrilegious.. ..before that I came to know the truth. But world, world will not believe this truth. What proof you have that you are sacred? Then what happened? Did you come to know about your husband or not? His address, I have come to know his address, but I am in a big confusion. This is what I want to ask you. In these circumstances should I tell him my reality or not. This is a very confusing question. I would give you a solution is till the time you prove your truth and sacredness.. ..telling your husband about this, ..only shamefulness and betrayers, and it would be dangerous. I feel very pity on your state. Sometimes I feel, I have a brother in this world, would go and ask help from him.. No, sister. Never do like this. Why? It is even worst than this. Why brother? Sister, the truth is, in our society, a woman's reprehension.. ..more than husband, causes more pain to father and brother's dignity. Husband might even forgive you.. ..but father and brother can never tolerate their girl's reprehension. Are you crying sister? No brother. You at least asked me. You told me everything as your brother. I know you are innocent, but society would not accept this. No one will accept it. Manohar. Mother, salutations. How are you Manohar? What brother, this new nurse works properly or not. She is very nice. Gopal, this poor lady is very sad. Manohar, I have come to talk to you a very important thing. Tell me mother. Mother, I had told you not to tell. You started talking the same thing with Manohar. Then whom do I tell. It is because of him only you are ignoring marriage, right? Manohar, you tell me. Parvathi is not going to return back now. Because of her is he going to sit like this whole of his life? Son, I have already given a word to Laxmi's mother. It is a nice house. She is a nice girl. If I force him, he tells it will cause pain to Manohar. Mother, I won't let you trouble Manohar like this. Being a doctor, I again warn you, don't talk to him all these things. Hello, doctor. Hello Laxmi, come. Come sister. So, you are here. Look, in search of you where all we reach. Thank you. I have not yet told you the real thing of telling thanks. Do you know, for the blind hospital.. ..how much funds I have collected? How much? 32000 rupees. I have wandered in all the bungalows of Missouri. Wonderful. You have done a miracle. Manohar, this is Laxmi Devi. We wanted to build a hospital for blind people.. ..she has done many shows for that and look how much funds she has collected. Laxmi devi, from all the blind people, I thank you. Tell thanks to doctor who showed me this way. If you have so much sympathy towards blind people, then.. ..can you give something to this blind man? What do you want? I want a sister. I had a sister, which God snatched it from me. If you think I am worth, then think me as your younger sister, brother. Did you tell brother from the heart or sympathized a blind man. I have told it from the heart, from the heart. If you have told me brother, then you have to obey your brother. Order me brother. Laxmi, Laxmi, I have a very big debt on me, please repay that, sister. Debt, whose debt brother? Gopal's mother. Laxmi, I had decided to make my sister as her daughter-in-law.. ..and give it in her foot steps, but death took her on the way. Now that you have become my sister, please fulfill my decision. Brother. Laxmi, in this house my sister's place is empty. Please fill that. I can't see this house empty. Manohar. - No, Gopal. What are you talking Manohar? You have done many favors on me, please do one more favor. Accept this marriage proposal, for my sake, for me. This is my younger sister and she is only Parvathi. Accept her Gopal, accept her. Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God This destitute girl has come under your shelter." Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God Leaving your door God, who else's door will I go? Leaving your door God, who else's door will I go? Who else is my support other than you, whom will I trust.

Everything is destroyed. All my plans have failed. What happened? - Nothing, fool. Madam is marrying Laxmi with some doctor Gopal.. ..in Missouri. And she has not even called us. This all is you fault. What is my fault in this? - No it is my fault.. ..that I gave birth to a fool like you. God. I have only one wish, that he should be happy. Always happy. Give me your blessing so that I can serve him as a maid. Where is Jamuna? - I don't know mother. Jamuna. Oh. Jamuna. Daughter, what are you doing here? Take this. I have brought clothes for you. For me. - Yes, get ready soon. You have to.. ..to apply Heena on the hands of the bride. - Heena! Yes. The girls are waiting for you outside. Get ready and come soon. "Oh friend! Get ready and go to your husband's house." "Oh friend! Get ready and go to your husband's house." "You be happy and don't worry about my tears." "Oh friend! Get ready and go to your husband's house." "One house is getting ruined and one is getting ready." "This is the rule of this world." "Go bride and don't look back to see.." "..the conditions of your friends." "Everyone's destiny is different." "Someone wins while someone loses." "Oh friend! Get ready and go to your husband's house." Where is the groom's sister? - Sister! Where is Jamuna? What Jamuna is not here? You came, daughter. Come. Come fast. Hold this plate. And perform the 'Aarti' ceremony. - I? Yes, yes. This ceremony is performed by the sisters. But I am not a sister. I am a maid. No, you are just like my daughter. Come on. The auspicious time has come. Do it fast. No mother, I can't do this. I can't do this. Don't force me to do it. Doctor, I can see. I can see everything doctor. Look, this telephone. This book. This newspaper. I can read. Look this is 'Times'. This is 'Statement.' This is 'National Age'. This is 'Navbharat Times.' What? Parvati is alive. Parvati. Parvati is alive. 'Your voice is just like my sister.' 'Think of me, as your Parvati. Brother.' 'I have a brother too.' Where are you? No I can't do this. I can't do this. Gopal! Gopal! Gopal! Parvati is alive. Parati is alive. - Parvati is alive. Yes, yes. That nurse is Parvati. Nurse! Jamuna. She is not Jamuna, she is Parvati. Where is she? - She ran from here just now. Parvati! Where are you running? Is Ravi here? - Ravi! Ravi! What is Ravi going to do here? We have misunderstood him. Ravi is looking everywhere for Laxmi. Don't stop me. Let me go. Please. For God's sake, let me go. You listen to me. You are mistaken. You read this. Laxmi, Ravi wanted to give this letter to you. You will know the truth if you read this once. Just read it one time, daughter. Never. I won't let you go like this. Parvati. Brother. - Parvati. Brother. - Parvati. Brother. - Parvati. Parvati, Why did you lie to a blind brother? - Brother. You cared for me as a nurse. But you didn't tell me.. ..that you were my Parvati. Brother. - Why did you lie to me Parvati? Why did you lie to me Parvati? Brother. I don't deserve to be called your sister, brother. Why not Parvati? Why? I always thought of myself as your brother Manohar. I kept you in my house as my sister. You are without any blemish, Parvati. You are without any blemish. I can give testimony in front of the whole world. There is no need for any testimony. This Goddess is herself proof that she is pure. Parvati, I wasn't such a bad man. Why didn't you trust me? Why didn't you tell me the truth? I made a mistake, please forgive me. No, no. Parvati. Get up. Gopal. Is this true? Yes mother, she is your daughter-in-law. Mother. - My daughter-in-law. God bless you. You kept all your grief inside. You never.. ..said a word to others. God bless you. Look, there is Ravi. Ravi-Laxmi. Ravi, uncle told me everything. Please forgive me Ravi. No, no Laxmi. It isn't your fault? It is nobody's fault, child. It was just a game of destiny. Destiny separated us, and destiny united us. Father. Destiny had nothing to do with this meeting. I did. When I saw the dance photo of Laxmi in Musori.. ..I showed it to Ravi. And because of it they met. Sister-in-law. - Saroj. Sister-in-law. You are really a great man. We all would like.. ..to thank you. Today both my sisters will go their husband's house. Today my life is full of happiness. Hey. Don't put the veil or else there.. ..will be mix-up again.
