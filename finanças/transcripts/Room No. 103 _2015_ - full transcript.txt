Smoking causes cancer. Smoking is injurious to health. Drinking is injurious to health. Drinking alcohol is injurious to health. 33 years have gone by. 33 years in one area of the city. 33 years have been spent in this hotel. It had eight rooms then.. No, not eight. It had nine rooms. From 101 to 109. And then, second floor. 201 to 208. Eight rooms. Then third floor. 301 to 308. Eight rooms more. Make the payment. I am standing outside. Yes. Okay. Waiter. I have seen so many people for the last 33 years. So many of them. And the number of people.. I know by names would be around 1000 to 2000. As for example, Mr. Bipul Barua. From Assam. He is a regular for the last 5 years. He has a business of coconuts' waste products. Two slices of bread. And poached double eggs. And then.. He will call the waiter now. Waiter. Yes, sir. - One coffee without sugar. But in the crowd of thousands of people.. There are a few people on seeing whom I can understand.. That they are different. Good afternoon, sir. - Welcome, sir. They are different. They have not come to this hotel. So what can I do for you, sir? They have come to Room number 103. Yes. They are the clients for room number 103. Between their birth and death, this room is.. This room has a connection somewhere. Destiny and God.. I don't believe in these. Yet, it seems there is a relation somewhere. They are destined for room number 103. They must come to this room. Hello. - Hello, sir. Many times, it had so happened that no one came. And the room used to remain empty. And then, one day.. One day, all of a sudden, that person would come. It is not that he is different to look at. Or looked different. But right on seeing him, I could understand, here is my client. Have you got it? You havn't. I know it. He is my client. Room number 103 is kept for him. Not everyone is getting killed. But there is something. A new chapter of their life will probably start from here. Or maybe it will end here. Is it the pictures? No, I have tried to find out a lot of times. These are inexpensive paintings bought from an exhibition.. By an unknown painter. A little dusty. Curtains of dark shades. A bed. It is like any other normal room of the hotel. Yet.. Sir. We will have lunch here today. Okay, as you say. How can I help you, sir? Why the hell is she here? Please ask her to leave the room. Please ask her to leave the room. I can't tolerate this. Please ask her to leave. Please. Why the hell is she here? Go. Go. Go. Go. Leave me alone. I can't tolerate this anymore. I can't. Please. Please. How many? No. I have not counted. There have been many of them. There have been many of them in the last thirty three years. Lovers. Insurance agents. Political leaders. Poets. Important people. On seeing some of them, I have understood. Room number 103. I am growing old. I cannot remember the old events. There are quite a few incidents in the last two or three years.. Which I remember very well. One of them is.. Dyotona. Dyotona Mukherjee. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening. Is there a room available?

But you said it incorrectly. Hey, I didn't say anything incorrect. Tell me first. You said Lenin. And he didn't say anything. Right? - What did you say? What is it? I said Netaji. Netaji. And then, Hitler. How did you say Hitler? No, you said Hitler.. - No. No, you said something wrong. Not you. Dyotona said it wrong. Hey, I was right. What is the mistake? Okay, forget all this now. Sing a song now. Dyotona, please. She will sing if Imdadul asks her.. Wow. Why will she sing if I ask her? Yes. I will sing if you ask me to. Okay. In that case, sing. "With all that is mine" "Awaiting am I" I can't sing. Don't act coy. Sing. Please, sing. - Please, Dyotona. Hey, begin now. - Sing, sing. "With all that is mine" "Awaiting am I ."

Why would I need the profile? Wait. And you? Sir. You had told me that you will do my movie. The one that I have in hand now, needs a high budget. Sir. Investing money with you isn't a problem.

Where is your house? Near Behala police station. Which college? Jadavpur university. Yes, Animesh. What time? At nine in the night? Yes, perfect. I have time today. I will watch it today. But if the panel would have been interesting.. We could have had a nice chat. And listen, please promote my new release. No, no. At nine in the night. Only Kolkata T.V. Nothing else. Absolutely. Bye. So that means you want to say that marriage, this system, has no meaning? There is no meaning. If you look into the ancient facts and sources.. There was no marriage there. Till date, in many tribal communities.. Marriage is a half hearted loose system. A ritual of the elite class. Why? Doesn't marriage exist in the old epics like Mahabharat and Ramayana? On the contrary, there is. And here lies the story.. The war.. Meaning.. - But.. Who will inherit my wealth after my death? It is a system to decide that. - Why? Is that bad? Look, I am not here to decide about bad and good. That is not relevant. And kids? What about the identity of kids? Pandu, Dhritarashtra. Do you know who their father was? - Right. The identity will belong to the person. What is the point of giving the reference of parents? And wife's right? Breaking the institution of marriage would mean.. - Right. Is like taking away her respect. What right? A man or a woman isn't a cupboard or suitcase. One wouldn't remain to be dominated by the other. They will have mutual understanding between themselves. I see. So that means you want to say that a woman and a man will stay together.. And yet will not get married? Let there be two persons or three persons. Or maybe seven persons. It doesn't matter. They are women or men. Either they are Adam and Eve. Nothing else. And wealth? That is your problem. I earn and I spend. What? Look, I can donate my flat in your name. I don't care. I have no problem. But I still believe that marriage is a decaying social institution. This is where.. - No. This is where I have to say something else.. No, we cannot have any more of this discussion. We don't have time. We have to finish this discussion right here. You were watching.. the necessity of marriage in the society. We had among us the famous film director Kaushik Ray. And we had poet Mallika Ghosh Roy. How do you think this discussion was? Do let us know about your opinions. You are watching Kolkata T.V. All day. Seven days. I think you are right. Is Bumba coming? And listen. Our producer. What is his name? Mr. Roy. Mr. Roy. Yes. Tell him that we need at least Black Label. Or else, I will not come. You have told him? Come to the office in the evening. I have something for you. And if I drop you a little ahead.. I mean near Thakurpur. Would you have a problem? No. Okay. That's like a good girl. Biswas. Sir I have paid the rest amount the entire amount. What? Now pls start my movie - Yes. Bapi. - Yes, brother. When do the takes start? From 9th August. 9th August. Okay. You can block the other artists. - Okay. Okay, fine. And listen. - Yes, tell me, sir. Now you have to increase the budget. I will release during the durga puja. There will be expenses for the promotion. Don't worry, sir. I am here. Come with me. Oh, you are here? Wait. Wait. Here we are. Here is the CD. Here are the lyrics. Item song. Item number? Item? Yes. Item. What is wrong with item number? What did you think? You will be the heroine in a Kaushik Ray movie? Central lead? Well, if you have talent, you can prove yourself in this item number. Go. Bapi has the contract. Sign it. And something else. Don't be in a hurry. You have parts. "Lonely nights, the showers made me soaked all of a sudden." "All the night." "My empty heart. It is very naughty. Got me into trouble." "What is this trouble?" "I don't know what these sudden showers of the night want." Cut it. Are you ready? - Yes, brother. Okay, okay. - Come on. We will take final rehearsal. Okay? Final rehearsal. Sound ready? - Ready. Whose phone is ringing? - I don't know. Whose phone is ringing? Who is this idiot? Whose phone is ringing, fool? - Sir, it is mine. Yours? - Sorry, sir. What do you think of yourself? Yes? - Sorry, sir. Buffoon stupid producer. Sorry, sir. - this is my shooting floor not your office Sir, I didn't understand. - Pack up, Bapi. Sir, please. Sir.. - Brother, please. Pack up. Bapi. I will state something clearly. - Sir. Sir, sir. Please.. - If I see this producer on this floor the next time.. Sir, sir, sir.. - I will stop the shooting. Idiot. Fool! Brother. Please.. - Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Shut up! Brother.. - Brother. Brother. Agarwal had called. Hey, get me some food.. - Waiter. Come here. Yes. Tell me. - Hey, get some food here as well. Yes, yes. Is it? - Just a minute. Just a minute.

How are you? - When will you make a movie with me? Give me one now. Yes. We are starting one in August. Come to my office next week. Sure. Okay. - Thank you. Are you doing fine otherwise? Please tell him that I will definitely call back. Okay, I will leave now. See you. Kaushik. - One minute. Okay? Okay. Hey, come on. Let me see. - Hey, this is such a great party, right? Waiter. - Come and serve me some food. Hey. How are you? - I am fine. I met you after very long. - I know. Hope you are doing good. Hello. - Hi. I have never seen you earlier. Struggling. I see. That's nice. I can give you a break. - Sure? Sure. I have something for you. Why don't you come and meet me? Come to my office. A part of three pages? You have a lot of information on me. No. I have something better than that. Heroine. A heroine? Why not? You deserve more than that. Come to the office tomorrow. Do you know the address? Everyone knows. Yes, what is it? No, no. I did like on seeing the pictures. Now we have to take a screen test. And there is something else as well. If she has school or some exams or other problems.. Do let me know beforehand. Please. - No, no, no. There is no problem. And there is something else. On the outdoor, we can accommodate only one guardian. Meaning one? - Yes. One. That means I will be there. He doesn't have time. He is always busy. - Okay. Please call Bapi. Okay. - Okay? Come on. Hello. Yes. Bapi.. Get the cheque book and the contract paper. Okay. I see. Thanks. Contract. Script? Script?

Can unilaterally break.. The contract.. If she does not like feel.. Comfortable with the.. Final script. Okay. - Your advance. 1.5 lakhs. - Thank you. I need this laughter. How are you placed in the evening? I hope there isn't a problem if you don't return home in the evening. I stay at a hostel. There is no problem really. Hello, 'Raatdin'? Is Rudra da there? Yes, Rudra da. Bapi here. Welcome, sir. Sir. Mr. Ray. I see. Welcome, Mr. Ray. Bapi had called. Your room.. Sorry, sir. I have to give you a different room today. Yours is booked. - No problem. Last week, I watched Bhikhari Paswan. Oh wonderful. Simply wonderful. What a sensitive film. I liked that statement the most. Honesty! Honesty! Honesty! You must have honesty to fight the evil. The war of justice with injustice. Oh! The whole house was thoroughly spellbound. Is the AC working? - Yes, sir. Four Black Label. Ice. Cold water. And sauté prawn. Fry the vegetables lightly. I know, sir. Go to the room. It will reach in sometime. Room number 103. The keys. Why are you laughing? When these spectacles are taken off, you seem a little strange. How do I look? Unknown. Not like Kaushik Ray. Now? Perfect. Any problem? So quickly? You know something? You are gorgeous. To how many people have you said that? Why are you so rude? Am I being rude.. Not a single word. For God's sake. Hold your tongue and let me love. Will the rest of the life get spent like this? This is great. What is bad about it? Now get married. I don't believe in marriage. Why? I don't believe it. Not even me? Don't tell me that you want to marry me. Why? What is the problem? I think marriage is a useless system. A relationship between two people is much more important. Now consider our relation. We can maintain it. Or we can break it. If we so wish, we can stay together. Or else, we can go our ways. In fact, I don't believe in marriage. Fantastic. You don't believe in marriage. In that case.. What is this? What is this? Come on. "Twinkle, twinkle little star." "How I wonder what you are?" "Up above the world so high." "Like a diamond in the sky." Where did you get it? Where did you get it? Where did you get it? Don't shout, my baby. Actually you had seen me in my childhood. That is why you don't remember me. Yes. So? How was the sex? You must have enjoyed it. And this is.. Bye. There was a problem with the cops. There was no entry in the register. That is why. But it was solved later. It is a never ending story. At any time, someone might come again. They will come. Is there a room? Is there a room? Sure, sir. Room 103. The last room in the corridor. I know it.
