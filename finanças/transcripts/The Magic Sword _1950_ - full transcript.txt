I hardly got rid of him. I know your father won`t give you to me. And that the tribe elder... ...want you for his Gricko . Why me for son-in-law, when he can be family with elder of the tribe? That`s why I`ve come. To tell you a secret. In our kind, from long ago, from generation to the next... ...goes a myth. Female child shall not be married before it turns 18 years. Or it would die, instantly. In the dawn of the day it turns 18, when third rooster sings... ...someone asks for the girl, she must be given to him. Then, my father must give me to you. So, five days from today, in the dawn, with the third rooster, you knock on my door. I shall not be sinfull for telling you a secret. I`ll be forgiven. But I`ll rather die than go apart with you. Soon the second roosters will sing, and the groom is still sleeping. Ah, if I was younger... You`ll be awoken already. Look at him! He`s awake. Only pretending... Grandpa`s sunshine... Just to frighten me? No hard feelings, grandpa. No time for jokes. That`s the second rooster. -Hurry up, then! Quickly! Whish me luck, grandpa. -All that you can have, little one. What are you doing here, Gricko? Well, I`m waiting, you see. So wait, damn it. Open... -Open up... I`ve come for... -I want to ask... Who is it? Who`s banging on the door? Good fortune, fellas. May you be happy and honorable. What`s the occasion? Good morning... -Good morning, father... I`ve come for your daughter, to be my bride. -I`ve come to marry your daughter. There you go now! Whom shall I give her to? I must stick to the myths of my kind. But it`s not worth if there are two of you! I`ll tell you, father. My father is the elder of the tribe. His house is my house. We live in plenty. Your daughter will be fine in our house. She`ll be well fed... -Enough. ...she`ll be first among the only. Neboisha has nothing and no one, only a old grandfather... -Enough!! You are not to teach me, youngster! I know what to do, if it`s up to me! But the pledge in my kind is that the girl should choose herself... So, put your presents in the plate... ...and I`ll get the girl. Whose present she takes first... ...that one will have her. Daughter... They`ve come to propose. And they brought you presents. Take them. The girl has chosen her happynes. Owner of the present may approach. If destiny says so, may you be happy and blessed in your long lives. Curse on you, now and for all times! To be humiliated like this! You`ll hear from me yet! Right in the pillar, you say? -Right that! Moved the whole house! Go find Gricko. Where is Gricko? Send for Gricko, his father wants to see him. Gricko? Has anyone seen him? Where is he? Master, mighty Evil-Steele, we found him in the forrest. Must be a spy or such. He`s in your mercy. Cut his head off! Mercy! Mercy, great master! Trouble has driven me to the woods. Listen to me before you judge! Go on, speak. My trouble is big, master. From me, son of a tribe elder, bride was taken... ...by Neboisha, peasant. There they are now, celebrating the marriage. She`s like the flower. Most beautiful flower. Sun glows from her face, moonlight from the neck... Shiny morning from her bosoms! And when she smiles... you can`t think further. Aren`t you... lying to me, huh? My head is precious to me, master. Here comes Evil-Steele, lord and master of the Dark Tower! Yield to his will, people! What? Him! It can`t be! Neboisha! I`m no other than great Evil-Steele. Lord and master of the Dark Tower. From now on, commander of all this lands. All of you shall be my slaves! Chear up! Be happy! Master wants you to be happy! Hear me, people! Me and my men cannot be killed by a sword! Nor by a spear! Beware of me! Don`t make me angry! Bow to my force!! Hold on, Neboisha! What misfortune had brought you here, kind soul? Big trouble. Great sorrow, old man. Evil-Steele proclaimed himself as lord and master of whole land. He has thrown all people in slavery and stole my bride from the vedding. Eh, my son... Evil-Steele and his men posses force that is from another world. But there are greater forces on this world. Force over forces! Remember... The greatest is love and thirst for knowledge, from which wisdom came! Wisdom knows many secrets, including the secret of Evil-Steele`s might. You`re out of your mind, old man. I am not! I`m talking about things I`ve known... ...before this fiend tricked me, and manacled me in this chains. Couldn`t tell anyone this since I`ve been in the dungeons of this strange house. I know the secret of Evil-Steele! Secret! -My bones are rotten... ...but the soul lives so this secret doesn`t go in the grave with me. So, listen to me very carefuly, lad! On 77th mountain, there is a cave. In the cave resides an old hag. You ought to serve her... ..for three days and three nights, to watch over one mare. You can do that only if you ride it whole time and don`t let sleep overcome you! If I do that? -Than you can ask the hag anything you need. What shall I ask? -Listen. The hag has 12 horses. Everyone better than the best. There is one that appears leperous. Above that one is the sword. Take the horse and the sword! Why the leperous one? -You`ll find out later. Go! They can`t find you with me! This is the spy we caught tonight. Well, it`s the groom! Came running for the bride? Tie him for the horses tails! Bring the girl to the highest tower... ...so they can enjoy looking each other! Why are you laughing? Do you remember giving me a life, once? Take that one from me and i still got my own. Remember... I remember. Run now, as fast as you can. There will be no second forgiving! I beg you once more, mighty Evil-Steele. Let me see my bride one more time. Go! Vida? Neboisha! Vida, I`ve found out Evil-Steele`s secret. I`m going away to find the sword which will destroy the fiend. Wait for me, I shall return. When I do, nothing will separate us again. In the meanwhile, fool him around, any which way you can. Postpone, as hard as you can, to become his wife. Come now! Move! Take this, to guard you from evil. And to keep me on your mind. May the fortune be with you. Sad are my old days. The child foolishly lost a life. What am I gonna do, alone and old? Good morning, grandpa! Grandpas happyness! And I already mourned you... Sit here, relax from long journey. -I`m not up for relaxing... I won`t let you anywhere, now! To get in trouble, to wonder around? Sit right there, you thick head. There`s your place! Do you remember, when I was little kid, and got lost in the forrest? Where did that come from? You see, out of total ignorance, I`ve released Evil-Steele then. He was riveted in a barrel. Tonight, his men captured me... ...and he would have killed me, if I haven`t told him that. So he released me. And you never told me anything? When I was young, elders have spoken of a giant hero which... ...had fought Evil-Steele and riveted him in a barrel. A long time ago... That was spoken. There`s more. While I was in the dungeons I saw an old man, manacled in hard iron. Nearly got gorgotten. He told me the secret of Evil-Steele! Now I know how to suppress him! There`s no other way, I must go on a road! And when I return, if there`s any luck left, I`ll shatter our malefactor! If that is the case, be blessed, my son. Go and find what you need to destroy the fiend. Let me down, you bully! You are going on a great journey. The world is filled with temptations. You`ll come across may evil things. But you should stick with the truth. That will be your strongest weapon. Bless me, grandpa. -Be blessed, my son. Gricko didn`t lie to me, last night. Decorate yourself, as much as you can, my pretty. Place the ornaments and rings, so we can be married even tonight! Do not touch me, mighty master! Last night I had a strange dream. Man`s hand cannot touch me until I`ve sawn a shirt for my groom. A silk shirt... Or I`ll die instantly! No! You shall not die! Don`t touch me, master, if you`re fond of my life! Maybe you`re right, my pretty. Start imediately your needlework, and finish it quickly! I will not be waiting too long! What are you doing here? I came to save you from this menace. His horse is fast as the bird, no one can get him. I`ll steal it, and we`ll run away. Sight of you gives me loathing. First you handed me over to this fiend, and now you`re gonna save me? Get out of my sight! You`re still fond of Neboisha... So you speak like that. Evil-Steele had let him out of town, but there is a execution party after him. You will not see him again! Go away! Get lost!! Go! Kind stranger, toss me back in to water. I`ll grant you a wish. Take a feather from me, and when you need me... ...rub it three times. -Thank you, friend. Hey, old hag! Where are you? Good fortune, old hag. -May it be yours, sonny boy. What`s the occasion? -I`d like to serve to you. All right, sonny boy. If you watch over my mare for three days... ...I`ll give you a horse of your choice. But if you fail to keep it... ...I`ll take thy head! I agree! -Come with me. Take a good look. -Give us thy head, old hag! Give it to us! See? They`ve all served me. And couldn`t keep the mare! I am not affraid of you or serving to you. Give the mare to me. Here she is, sonny boy. When you`re darn tootened... You can`t escape from your destiny. Take very good care of her. The others did not. Mind your own business, old hag. Don`t worry about me. Nice head you have. Watch it real good! The mare escaped! There`s my fish friend! What is the matter? The ols hag`s mare escaped me, can`t find it all night! She`ll take my head. -The mare is among us, turned into fish. Hit the ground and say: "abra-capocus". Wait! When the mare appears, capture it at once. -Thank you, friend. Abra-capocus! Hey, old hag? Here I am, the time is right. Wrong time for me, sonny. Mount off, I`ll give you lunch. You`ve earned it fair. Eat, I`ll be right back. Didn`t you turn into fish, you bitch!? -I did that, but they are his friends. So they revealed me. Well, I`ve served you good. Now, get me what`s mine, as we agreed. Right, agreement is agreement. Come with me. Give thy head to us, old hag. Give it! Give it to us! Shut up, you fool! This one kept the mare. There it is, sonny boy. Choose any of these twelve horses. What`s there to choose? Give me the worst one. This lousy rag, right here. Why that one over those beautifull horses? -This one I want, as agreed. Take it. Hey, hag! -What is it? Where is the sword that comes with this horse? -No weapons with that one. You`ve tricked me... That isn`t fair. -There was a sword... ...but it isn`t here now. Listen now. When you exit the cave, water the horse on the well rigtht in front. Then, stampeed him all over to the ninth kingdom. -Why all the way there? There is a town, with an empress. The rest you`ll find out there. Ride straight, do not stop! -Farewell, old hag, thanks for the advice. What`s long ride for others, you`ll make before nightfall. Vine, more vine! Tell me, good man... Who are these merry heroes, on this rich feast? Coming from far, huh? Haven`t you heard of big competition that takes place here, tomorrow? Competition? -Yes, stranger. A year ago, our emperor has died, and his daughter, our empress... ...took a vow to marry the winner of the competition, exactly one year after her fathers death. The winner will become the emperor, and the sword... -What sword? He`ll inherit the emperors sword. Some say the sword is magic one. Tell me something else... Who can compete tomorrow? Everyone... With a brave heart. Only one hero can have the empire. -Those who loose... ...will have their heads cut off, on the day of the celebration. Those are the terms. -Let me through, friend. I`ll compete too, tomorrow. Good evening, good people. What did he say? Good people? Good people are killing each other around here! Did you also came to fight for the empire and the empress? Yes I did, brave one. -Did you hear... he wants it... Let`s drink some vine. With anyone but you. Drink, peasant! If I get mad, you`ll... be sorry. I don`t care for you or your vine, you bandit! I will not drink it! Drink, peasant, before I force it down your throat! Rattle, rattle, little rattler, what caused all this anger? Nothing smart in the head, goes around all day ahead! Rattle, rattle, little rattler... There`s a peasant present, look. Won`t be good for him to become an emperor. Why? -I know a story. It`s all true. -Speak, you fool. Man turns to a king over night. Sees every rellish of being a king. When he didn`t know what else to do, he commanded to hang him! That`s the end. -Get away, you fool! Be cheerfull great heroes, tomorrow is a sad day for you. But be comforted. Our empress is... sweet, our empire is... great. But the secret hounts us around, one of our native ground. Secret that is great, secret that is desperate. Our empire spreads far away, we have it all, castles, treasures, always a ball. What to do with this sorrow large, all the time fools are in charge! One man`s wise, one is smart, fool in the middle, can`t tell `em apart. Have fun, young peasant. There are worse men than you under the sun. Leave me be, good man. I`m not up for your jokes. What brought you here, then? -Great trouble. Tell me, about the sword... Is it realy magic? People tell stories... Some says yes, some says no. I haven`t held it in my hands. The empress is asking three questions: First, what is most beautifull? Second, what is most powerfull? Third, what has biggest sharpness in the whole world? Don`t you know oldest sorrows? Mind masters, while strenght rolls rocks! Here I am great empress. -All right, brave man. Can you tell me what is the most beautiful thing in a whole world? You, mighty empress. Most powerfull? -Strenght! Most shapren? -A good sword. Most powerfull? Most beautifull? Take away this emptyheaded ass. -Haven`t I guessed? Let me go! I won`t go! Let me go! It`s the strenght... Isn`t a good sword the most sharpen thing in a whole world? What is then? -What did grandpa Ivan say...? "Stick to the most sharpen weapon." Hey, the truth is most sharpen weapon! The truth? What can be most beautifull? Freedom... Something else? No. Freedom is most beautifull. What brought me over here? Love? Right! Love is most powerfull! What did the pesant say? What did he say? I heard: truth, freedom and love. Could it be right answer? Maybe he`s not just a peasant... -Who shall know? You know what? We shall let him go before us, and if they don`t take him away... ...it means he`s right, and that`s what we must say! You go next, peasant, since you know the answers. We`ll think little more. -I`ll go then. What is the most sharpen thing? The truth. Most powerfull? Love. Would you nkow the answer to this? What is the most beautifull thing? Freedom, empress. Who tought you to speak so wisely? -Trouble, empress. You can go. The peasant was right. You`ll go next. Just pass on your way, hero. Last thing, what is most beautifull? -Freedom, empress. All right, you can go. I know all three anwers, all together! Truth, freedom, love! Where did you hear that? -From the peasant. Well, I knew it before... -You can go. Mount off your horses! Get your bows and arrows! Let`s see who is archer good enough to hit the apple through the ring! Easy for me. I`m able to hit a sparrow in flight. Me, when I`m hungry for walnuts, I`m knocking them of the tree with arrows. Hey, peasant, when I become a king, and I shall be one, I`ll put you... ...in the highest tower and leave to hang! No one has won yet! Empress says... ...you should compete in a heroic duel! One who wins shall approach her. Get that skunk! Why did you pretend you`re dead if the arrow didn`t hurt you? First didn`t hurt me, but the second would, for sure. Get dressed, brave one, and take this mighty emperor`s weapon. It belongs to you, now. He`s wise, brave and handsome. Yes, empress, he`s gorgeous fellow. He is not a fellow to you, he is your emperor! Yes, empress. I earned old emperor`s weapon in a fair battle. But I care not for your hand, mighty empress. Nor do I care to be a emperor. Thank you for your concern. Hold it! Stop him!! Don`t let him! Strange hero arrives, on a white horse! Let him in. Good fortune, good folks! What fortune? There`s no fortune for us, kind hero, it left us long time ago. What are you talking, blacksmith? Why so hard words? While ago we were free people. Then, Evil-Steele came here with his army. He enslaved all of us. -He stole my grandsons bride... ...right from the wedding, and dispeled him far away. Tell us, what misfortune got you here, where all you can hear is... ...women and orphans crying? I`ve heard of you, Marko. Your fame has come a long way. I`ve heard you`re the best blacksmith. So I wanted to ask you... ...can you make another sword, like this one? It`s been a long time since smoke came out of my chimney... I can make better one. -Is that so? Your`s break when you hit the steel, and look at this one! Let me try, to see will it cut steel in my hands. What kind of sword is it? Something is written here! What it says? Interpret this to us. "This sword is... Magic. Welded in great suffering, tears and swet. This sword is work of solidary hands. Fighters welded it in trouble. When fiend is attacked bravely, all swords are magic." He`s returned! Neboisha! Brothers, I`ve travelled the world to find this magic sword. I`ve won it in battle, and I returned... ...to join you in a fight against Evil-Steele! We still have the hearts and strenght not to bow to the evil one. Tears and swet we also have. Let us weld our swords, to protect our freedom! Let`s weld for freedom! Marko, hero, it`s working! You, again? -Vida, my sunshine! I`ve prepared everything, say a word, and I`ll get his horse... ...and the world is our oyster. No one will get us. Go away! I can`t look at you any more! Don`t say that. My only sunshine. It was hard to get the key of the stable, no way I can get it back now. Decide now and we`ll go away. You`ll have everything. I`m sick of your sight, sick of a soud of your voice! Go away! Don`t waste your pride, girl. You`ll be beging me for mercy! You don`t have servant as reliable as me, gentle master. I have come. As your truly servant, gentle master. Vida! -What do you want? I cant tell you unless you promise you wouldn`t hurt me. Speak, I will not. -That shirt she is sawing... Yes, it`s taking too long! -I know why, my lord! She united with wiches and evil spirits! Dropped a curse on that shirt! First one who dresses it will die! Bring me Vida, my bride! And you... If you told me the truth, you`ll be my advisor. But if you`re lying... You`ve sent for me, master. From my men I`ve heard that you`re associated with evil spirits. That you have cursed that shirt. Whoever dresses it shall die at once. I`ll burn you on the stake! If you burn, then you`re a which. If you don`t burn, I`ll know who lied to me! Why would you set a stake, my lord? You can asure yourself of the truth right now. Order Gricko to dress the shirt. If he dies, won`t be a waste. I can be punished easily. If he doesn`t die, they`ve lied to you. Dress it. Mercy! -Dress it!! Say... Appears there`s nothin wrong! -Mercy! Curses? Magic? Mercy! Mercy!! Marko... -What is it? Give me one sword. Indulge the old soul. Can`t do that, grandpa, it is not for yout age. No way, grandpa. -Be quiet, you... I may be old but the whish is strong... Please, Marko. I haven`t got time, grandpa! Do not touch me, master. I haven`t made you a shirt. No more shirts! Looks like you`ve made that one for Gricko! Master! Master, stop! -What do you want? Mighty master, people have risen to arms, and are attacking your town. So what? Take a few men and get rid of them! -There hundreds of them! That Neboisha is leading them in a warriors uniform! Why are you standing there? Get the men to the gate! There is no such sword he can kill me with! M a g i c S w o r d subtitles by: Wild Bunch 2003. T H E E N D
