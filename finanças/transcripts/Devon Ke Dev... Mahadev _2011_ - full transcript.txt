Parvati! Parvati, where were you? We've been searching for you. Where did you vanish to? You were searching for me needlessly, jaya. I was, where i should be... ...at shiva's refuge. Yes, i forgot. I forgot that since you became aware of the world... ...you've thought of shiva as your husband. Not the awareness of the world... ...but since i was born. That's alright. But your wedding... ...has been fixed to the prince of vindhyachal, isn't it? Parvati has been born to marry shiva. Neither am i aware of anybody else... ...nor do i wish to. He can be the prince of any kingdom... but neither have you met shiva... ...and nor do you know him. Where is he? How will you meet him? I've only loved shiva... ...and i'll be his wife alone. It's my resolve. And if he doesn't come to me... ...then i'll go to him. Mother. Does it ever happen in life... ...that we get... ...what we dream of? There's a lot of difference between... ...dreams and reality. I just know... ...that you should leave behind dreams... ...and accept reality. Life will be happy and prosperous. If there's any illusion in your mind... ...then you shouldn't let it grow. Remove it at the earliest. O lord... will we allow mother parvati's faith to be tested in this manner? Parvati's love for shiva... ...can't be removed by anybody. Not even by parvati herself. Yes... this wait is difficult... ...but it's unavoidable. Before the union... ...the longer the wait... ...the more stable will the union be. This love isn't just love... ...but a penance. And after this penance... ...parvati will attain shiva. 'My eyes are tired... ' '... staring at the path in wait... ' 'my tongue has blisters on them... ' '... chanting the name of rama.' '... chanting the name of rama.' '... chanting the name of rama.' '... chanting the name of rama.' Salutations, o sage. Lady... what do i see in your eyes? You await someone's arrival. No, sage. I don't await anybody. It isn't true. Yes... you're surely disappointed. Because you're unable to find... ...the one you search for. But lady... it's also possible... ...that the one you search for... ...he too, searches for you... ...in this world. What's being delayed... ...is your union. And this will surely happen. It has to. Salutations, sage. Lady... what do i see in your eyes? You await someone's arrival. You're surely disappointed. Because you're unable to find... ...the one you search for. What's being delayed... ...is your union. Your highness! Your highness! What is it, my lady? You appear worried. Parvati is nowhere to be seen. You don't need to worry, my lady. Commander! - Yes, your majesty. Split our army into twenty... ...and send them to every mountain. And search every corner of our kingdom... ...and find the whereabouts of my daughter. As you say, my lord. Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! Open your eyes, parvati. Look... i'm your father, i've come to take you. There's nothing to worry anymore. Nothing can harm you. Parvati! What happened to you, dear? You can't leave your parents like this. Open your eyes, parvati! You're alive! Yes, himavan, your daughter is alive. Himavan... how can the one on whom... ...all creation depends, die? Whenever i assume my true form... ...then he's known as the supreme lord... ...that is shiva. That shiva is lost in meditation... ...in this cave. And your daughter... ...goddess parvati... ...is none but... ...adi shakti, herself. She's born... ...to reunite with shiva. For the benefit of the world. That's why, in search of shiva... ...goddess parvati... ...reached here. Himavan... remove all obstacles... ...from the path of parvati... ...and help her... ...in attaining shiva. Forgive me, lord. Years ago, i promised parvati's hand... ...to the king of vindhya. How then can i get parvati married... ...to a renunciate... ...who lives on the funeral ground... ...who neither has wealth... ...nor etiquette... ...or any cultural bond. Nobody has any idea about... ...his family or lineage. Shiva doesn't need... ...any of these, o king. Shiva is himself... ...the source of all wealth and knowledge. You're not so enlightened... ...or aware... ...to understand the greatness of his persona. O lord... i've heard that sati is the consort of shiva. And even today, shiva's heart... ...awaits the arrival of sati. Adi shakti who's born as... ...parvati in this birth... ...was sati in her previous birth. Himavan... you're my devotee. Therefore, heed my words. Allow parvati... ...to realise her true self. And for the benefit of the world... ...remove all the obstacles... ...that arise on the path of her union with shiva. Parvati! Parvati! Parvati! What's wrong with her? Where was she? Where did you find her? She wasn't too far away, mena. She had fainted due to the cold. There's nothing to worry. - I'll never let her go alone anywhere... ...until she gets married. Parvati... why don't you send the ambassador... ...with the wedding invitation to vindhya? I've reminded himavan of the truth. But... ...will menavati accept it? Her child is more important to a mother... ...than even vishnu. Mena will never agree to you. Then... whom will she listen to? Only parvati can make her understand. Then goddess... ...tell me as well... ...how will this be possible? Let parvati first understand... ...why and what is happening in her life. Until parvati was unaware... ...she wasn't aware of herself and her powers. But now... ...after entering... ...into youth... ...she is realising... ...that if she has to attain shiva... ...then she'll have to be worthy of him. And the awareness of this... ...can frighten her. It can push her away from shiva. You're absolutely right, o goddess. Parvati. Do you still think about shiva? The biggest mistake of our life... ...living in the hermitage of... ...sage dadhichi and markandeya for so many years. That's why... ...your mind has been polluted with thoughts about shiva. But now... the time has come... ...that you should liberate your mind of these thoughts. Your marriage has been fixed with prince dandaka. I don't know... ...why your father hasn't decided the wedding date yet. How would he know the pain of a mother's heart... ...who has given birth to many children... ...but only... ...one is left. Am i not fortunate enough to witness her marriage? Every mother dreams... ...that her daughter finds a prince. She wishes to see her daughter prosper. Will i die without experiencing... ...this joy? Mother... don't say so. Now... ...i'll never cause you any grief. Then promise me... promise me, dear... ...that you'll marry the man... ...i say. I promise you, mother. Whoever you choose for me... ...i'll marry him. Parvati... i heard what your mother told you. Parvati, the truth is that... ...until yesterday, even i wanted... ...the same for you. Because i had promised the king of vindhya. I'm not unaware of the truth... ...that since childhood... ...you've accepted someone as your husband. You've limitless love... ...for someone in your heart. I... i've just come to assure you that... ...whatever you decide on... ...i'll always be with you. But my decision now... ...depends on mother's wish, father. I'll blindly marry... ...the man she asks me to. My happiness lies in it. Parvati... i'm confused upon hearing you. I'm unable to understand the truth. Aren't you the one... ...who always worshipped shiva? The one who considered shiva... ...her husband since childhood? Then parvati... why this change of heart today? There's been no change of heart, father. For some time... ...i didn't realise... ...that i'm not just a girl... ...but a daughter too. I'd become selfish. Because... no daughter... ...can be happy... ...after hurting her mother's heart... ...and causing her pain. I can't see tears in my mother's eyes. That's why i promised her... ...i've done my duty as a daughter... i'm doing that... ...which any daughter would do. Parvati is adi shakti herself... ...who has been born to reunite with shiva. Allow parvati... ...to realise herself. And remove all obstacles that stop her... ...from uniting with shiva, for the benefit of the world. The cave is nearby... which cave, father? Where shiva is lost in meditation... daughter... it's our good fortune that shiva considered... ...our land worthy of his penance. It's our duty now... ...to offer him our hospitality. It's my wish, parvati... ...that you should carry out this task. Right from arranging for his food... ...to making the cave worthy of his stay... ...will have to be done by you, parvati. But, father... ...it won't please mother. Daughter... we've to stop our thought from being muddled. In their life, every man... ...fulfills more than one duty. In fulfilling the duty of a daughter... ...one shouldn't forget the duty of a host. Shiva is our guest. We've to take care of him. And it'll be your responsibility. As you say, father. I'll personally arrange for it all. Jaya, vijaya... where are the two of you going? - Your highness... we're going to take food for that yogi... ...who's meditating in the cave on the mountain. But i'd assigned the responsibility... ...to princess parvati. Parvati is with the queen, in her room. She has taken parvati along with her for something... ...regarding her marriage. She has ordered us to take food to the cave. What is it, your highness? Have we done something wrong? No... no problem. Take the food back. And i'll talk to the queen regarding this. Go on. - Ok. Parvati. You've disappointed me, daughter. I told you to take food to shiva. And you gave this job... ...to jaya and vijaya? Mother called me for some important work. I couldn't refuse her orders... ...that's why... you couldn't refuse your mother's orders... ...that's why you disobeyed your father. No, father. Please don't think so. You're aware of the truth. But... i didn't wish to... ...hurt mother again. Parvati. I can hear dilemma... ...in your voice. What's the truth? The truth is what you're saying, father. Yes, i'm in a dilemma. Doubt resides in my heart. I'm afraid too, father. Afraid? Why? About what? I don't know. Since i remember... ...i've only thought of shiva... ...as my husband. Even sage dadhichi always said so. But now... ...when i'm about to meet shiva... ...then i'm doubtful about myself... ...whether i'm worthy of him or not. Will he accept me? What if i hurt him again? No, father. My heart isn't ready to meet him yet. Why do you think so? I don't know, father. I'm feeling very worried. I've to find the answer to this question. Who will answer this? Even i can't answer this question. But i'm confident... ...that lord vishnu's instruction... ...cannot be untrue. If he has said... ...that your marriage to shiva is definite... ...and that it's destined... ...then i'll bow my head... ...and accept it. And believe it too. Forgive me, your majesty. Sage dadhichi has arrived. Sage dadhichi? I told you, dear. It appears... ...that lord vishnu has sent... ...sage dadhichi here, to guide you. Go, dear. Go and welcome him. What are you thinking about, lord? I was thinking about parvati. Adi shakti... ...in the form of parvati... ...is having to face many emotional turmoils. Because of which... ...her thought, her life... ...is in chaos. It's worrisome, lord. I've sent sage dadhichi... ...to help parvati. She'll have to... ...prepare herself to meet shiva. And sage dadhichi... ...will help her do so. But... - but what, o narayana? But it's possible... ...that parvati might not be able to understand him. Why so, my lord? Because desire isn't... ...yet born in parvati's mind. More than the meaning of the truth and its consequence... ...it's the desire towards the truth that's important. As long as parvati isn't desirous... ...till then, sage dadhichi's voice... ...will not be effective on her. Don't worry, narayana. I'll enter her heart... ...and inspire her... ...to ask suitable questions... ...to sage dadhichi. And that she receives worthy answers to them. I, goddess lakshmi... ...will grant... ...the wealth of desire to parvati. By touching my feet... ...please don't make me a sinner, mother. Are you doing well? I wasn't until now, o sage. But on seeing you, i feel... ...that, hopefully, everything will be well. Not hopefully, mother. It'll surely be well. That's the reason for my visit. You hold a special place in my life, o sage. Whenever i've been faced with a difficult situation... ...or problem... ...you've always come to my aid. Even today, it's the most difficult day of my life. And today again, you've come to help me. It's my good fortune... ...that i can help you. But today... i haven't come here by choice. Lord vishnu has sent me here. Tell me your problem. I'll try my best... ...to find a solution to it. The problem is that... ...i myself don't know... ...whether the path i've set on... ...is worthy of me or not. You've always told me... ...that i'm born to marry shiva. Then why... ...do the clouds of doubt engulf my mind? Why does the question repeatedly arise... ...that whether shiva will accept me? Am i worthy of him or not? The truth is that... ...in this world, nobody is worthy of shiva. But there's also a truth... ...that the heart that's illuminated by truth... ...there's geniune devotion and love... ...that person can become worthy of shiva. Is it true? - Absolutely true. I've come here to show you... ...the path to become worthy of shiva. Please come. Along with desire... ...the ease of knowledge is important. The secrets of the universe... ...are mysterious, confusing and vague. It's beyond the understanding of man. The time to make parvati realise... ...the truth of the universe is here. Sage dadhichi... ...has gone to meet parvati. You're... ...the goddess of knowledge and wisdom... ...hence i request you... ...to help... ...parvati on this task. Your help... ...will enable her to understand the secret... ...of the universe very easily. Sure, my lord. I'll seat myself on sage dadhichi's tongue... ...and through his voice... ...i'll speak to parvati. So that, sage dadhichi's voice... ...will be more meaningful. And parvati is able... ...to understand better. The knowledge that i'm going to tell you about... ...was received by me from shiva himself. Through you... ...ordinary men will be able to learn it as a 'sutra' (short texts). This is one of the three primary purposes... ...of your life. O goddess... you're adi shakti. But having been born in a human womb... ...you've forgotten your true self. That's why you're engulfed by fear and anxiety. But every soul... ...is a form of that universal soul. By removing the sense of individual distinction from your soul... ...and by accepting fear as a state of mind... ...you'll enter a higher state of consciousness. And you... ...will be able to derive pleasure from your proximity to shiva. Because shiva... ...is the universal soul, himself. But, o sage... ...what is the way to break the shackles of fear? Awareness of one's true self. 'Tatvamasi'. By awareness of 'tatvamasi'. Meaning... ...that shiva, the universal soul, exists within me. I've to find him within me. Through this knowledge... ...man's soul... ...liberates itself from all other senses. Man's mind... ...through its endless thoughts... ...keeps supressing... ...that awareness. Years of culture... ...has been refining these five senses... ...even further. O sage... ...what are these five senses? What's the path to liberate oneself from them? Sage, you've explained everything to me in detail. But... what's the reason... ...that i'm still unable to free my mind of fear? Don't ever be in doubt. This is the difference between knowledge and experience. Whatever i told you... ...is just formless knowledge. Only through the presence of shiva... ...will this formless knowledge gain shape. And that moment... ...will be your realisation of being adi shakti. This isn't the time to hesitate or be in doubt. Shiva awaits you in that cave. And when the goal is shiva itself... ...then why fear the obstacles in the path? Accept this bilwa leaf, o mother. The power of this bilwa leaf... ...will open the doors of that cave to you. Go on, mother. The entire universe waits for your union with shiva. All the creatures of this universe... ...are separated from that universal soul. When the soul realises the truth about itself... seeing the troubled world moving away from shiva... ...the heart grieves... ...then in that heart... ...the desire to reunite arises. The power of this bilwa leaf... ...will open the doors of that cave to you. Shiva awaits you in that cave. And when the goal is shiva itself... ...then why fear the obstacles in the path? Go on, mother. The entire universe awaits your union with shiva. Where have i come? There are many types of perceptions. The stone is the external description of the idol. The one that we can see. The final description is within us. The entire universe resides within us. All the three dimensions are hidden inside. Past, present and future. It's all within us. Sati! Sati, look! Ignorance is the highest of the five distinctions. Every man... ...fails to emerge out of 'annamaya'... ...the dependency on food and water. Every layer... ...is like the whirls of a flower... ...the more the petals... ...open up... ...the greater is the fragrance of awareness... ...that emanates. Awareness of the 'muladhara' chakra... ...helps one emerge from 'annamaya'. This is the beginning. And this is the goal. If you can free yourself from 'annamaya' first... ...then you'll reach the level of 'pranamaya'. This is the dependency nurtured by air. And most people... ...due to the influence of the breath... ...are engulfed by ignorance and ego. Awakening the 'swadishthan chakra' located on the navel... ...will lead to liberation from 'pranamaya'. I'm not his devotee, but his consort. Shiva is mine, only mine. If he wishes to talk to me... ...then he'll come to me. Next is the 'ubigmaya'... ...through which man falls prey to jealousy. Envy is an indistinguishable part of his life. By harming you... ...they wish to cause me pain. Shiva is tricking you... in this civil society established by prajapati... ...this is considered despicable. I've hurt you enough, not anymore. When near the 'hridaya chakra'... ...man can control his opinion... ...and thoughts... ...to an extent. It can help realign 'vigmaya'. And finally, 'anandamaya'... ...which is composed entirely of the truth. Such a man, in all circumstances... ...is free of emotions and remains calm. Why do you keep appearing before me? Why don't you say that all this is meaningless? Who are you to protect me? What relationship do we share? I don't need your mercy. You called me unworthy the other day. But today... today, sati considers shiva unworthy of her. Shiva is just a stone for me. Only a stone... ...whose place is neither in my heart... ...nor in my house. You're on the other side of the funeral ground. And i... on this side. This boundary of the funeral ground will remain between us forever. I don't know all that... i just know... ...that if you love me... ...then you'll surely attend the ceremony with me. Or else, tell me... tell me that you don't love me. I'll fulfill all this after the ceremony. A woman's stubbornness is the cause for destruction, sati. If i said that we'll go, then we'll go. We'll surely go! Don't insult my father. It's impossible for us to attend the ceremony. Alright... if you don't wish to come along... ...then i'll go alone. You're under my oath, you won't stop me. If going there will bring me harm... ...then you can come after that. What bond do we share? You're under my oath... no! No, my lord isn't like this. He has... he has always kept me away from sorrow. But i never understood his love. Going there will only bring you harm. Harm! You speak as if he's not my father but my enemy. You've learn to act very well... ...from that fraud! I don't have any right to live after hearing so much. I'll have to liberate myself from this curse. This body has to be destroyed. Sati... the 'anandamaya chakra' located in the throat... ...guides the anxiety and restlessness inherent in man. In the forehead, lies the most powerful 'chakra'... ...'agya chakra'. By guiding the sixth sense... ...it brings the soul closer to the universal soul. When man becomes capable... ...of absorbing... ...both joy and sorrow without reacting... ...then he attains eternal bliss. You went through so much, o shiva... ...to attain me. You showered limitless love on me... ...but i... ...doubted that pious love... ...and insulted you... ...in my desire for my father. Your love is superior than mine. But if you love me so much... ...then why didn't you call me to you? Why did you wait so many years for me? How do i seek an apology... ...for something which was beyond my control? I was bound... ...by social values. But now... ...with renewed respect... ...in order to fulfill my duty as a wife... ...i surrender myself to you again. Please open your eyes now, o lord! The pain cause to you... ...was because of my unworthiness in the past life... ...but in this birth... ...i surrender myself in order to undo the harm done. Please open your eyes, o lord. And tell me... ...how do i become worthy of you? I'll make all attempts... ...possible and impossible. Alright, my lord. I'll find my own way to become worthy of you. But please look at me once. I'm so foolish. In my haste, i forgot my duty as a wife. You're meditating without food and water for years. And i didn't even ask you for food. I'll bring food for you right away. You can open your eyes after that and eat. And then if you wish... ...you can even look at me. Mother... mother... didn't you recognise me? Mother, please stop! Mother, my eyes are blessed to have seen you in person. Nandi! How can i forget you, nandi? You were the one who understood my love for shiva. And you... ...have transformed into stone! Parvati... do you recognise me? Sister... sister... don't let your sorrow flow as tears. Your sorrow... ...will be your biggest strength. Now, parvati... ...will have to appear in the form... ...in which she was separated from shiva. You're a woman, you've to appear in bridal finery. In the past birth, shiva had given you seven vows for marriage. For the fulfillment of those vows... ...shiva will have to break his penance. I'll do anything to... ...relieve the lord of his grief. Kamadeva... you'll have to awaken shiva. You'll have to give rise to the feelings of love... ...beauty and desire in his renunciate heart... ...that he should accept worldly life. And you'll have to do this today itself. Because mother parvati... ...is going to shiva as a wife. And you'll have to help her in this task. Indra, what are you saying! This is impossible. But you'll have to make it possible, kamadeva. Alright, o king. Goddess parvati... in order to help you succeed... ...my arrows of love... ...beauty and desire... ...will assist you. I'll begin this work... ...with my 'navmalika' arrow. It appears as if... ...the entire universe is with me in my success. Parvati... ...the fragrance of all the flowers of the universe are in this. When you offer these flowers to the lord... ...then his mind will be immersed in its aroma... ...and desire will be sown in his inner consciousness. This 'arvinda' arrow... ...will create that path... ...walking on which, mother parvati, will reach shiva. O demi-gods and celestial beings! It appears that all of creation... ...stands by mother parvati today. With my arrows... ...i'll have to fill this desolate cave... ...with love and beauty. Kamadeva has used all his four arrows. Only the arrow of enchantment remains. And mother parvati has neared shiva. Now, i'll have to use my 'tapana' arrow. It appears that the time for shiva and parvati's union has arrived. O lord... i accept you as my husband, again. You'll have to break your penance and bless me, today. You'll have to uphold the vows taken during our marriage. If today... if you don't do so, today... ...then i vow... ...that i'll sit in penance, like you. My lord! Please wait, my lord. Where do you go, leaving me, o lord? I've been waiting for you to break your penance. Why do you look at me like this? Who are you? You didn't recognise me, o lord? I'm parvati. Your parvati. Whoever you are... ...i don't know you. I don't share any body with you. Don't say so, my lord. We don't share a bond? Our bond is eternal. No, lady. The one you search for, isn't me. It's just your imagination. No, my lord. Please don't say so. Recognise me, i'm your parvati. The love for which you went into a meditative state... ...is me. The peace for which you renounced the world... ...that's me. The anger that rages within you... ...i'm the purity of that anger. The energies that emanate from you... ...i'm the source of it all. Stop, lady! Don't try to misguide me any further. The meditative state i was in... ...has nothing to do with beauty and grace. Renunciation shares no bond with love. There's a bond, o shiva! Without love, there's no penance... ...or meditation. Neither enlightenment, nor renunciation. Recognise me, o lord. I'm the sati... ...because of whom, you were insulted many times. I'm the sati, because of whom you were bonded by marriage. I'm the sati, who lost her right to be your consort because of her mistake. I'm the sati... ...who, despite your warnings... ...for the sake of your rights... ...sacrificed her body in her father's altar! I'm the sati... ...whose grief, angered you... ...and devastated the life of my father, prajapati daksha. I'm the sati, because of whom, you abandoned the world. And today, the same sati... ...stands before you in the form of parvati. Accept me, o shiva. Lady, if you're sati in the form of parvati... ...because of whom i'm lost in meditation... ...if you're the form of sati, because of whom i opened my third eye... ...then i don't accept that sati in the form of parvati. Not at any cost. Please stop, o lord! Please stop! You can't leave me like this. Please stop, o shiva! Please stop... please... o lord! Please stop, o lord. My lord... where are you going? Mother parvati is inside. How can you leave her? The woman you talk of, nandi... ...i share no relation with her. No, my lord. It's not possible. She's my mother. - Nandi! She's not your mother. My lord... she has gone through pain and trouble... ...to reach you. Accept her. Accept her, o lord. Never! O lord... mother parvati will attain you. But this nandi can never abandon you. Never. O lord! O lord! Where are you?! O lord! Where's my lord, kamadeva? He had come here on the orders of indra... ...to help you. Where is he? Even shiva isn't here. Where's shiva? He left. And my lord... something untoward happened. The fire of shiva's third eye... ...reduced kamadeva to ashes. No! This isn't possible! This can't be true! No! My lord! My lord! My lord... this can't be true. You can't leave me like this. You can't... we're all blessed... ...to see you in person... ...after so many years. O shiva... it was necessary to break your penance. That's why, we sent kamadeva. This has happened with our permission. Whatever happened here today... ...and whatever happened earlier... ...we seek your apology for it. What do you apologise for, narayana? Today, you all have made the same mistake that you did years ago. I'd told you all earlier too... ...that i'm not meant for marriage. But you all insisted on my marriage to sati. And bound me to sati by marriage. The world saw the consequences of that. And today, by breaking my penance... ...kamadeva repeated the mistake. O lord... mother parvati is still in the cave. She has been born again... ...to live with you. There's no mother here, nandi! The idea of my marriage is obsolete. If bonding brings happiness... ...it also brings along the burden of sorrow. O shiva, to ensure sustenance of creation... ...and to give it balance... ...your union to parvati is vital. Moreover, parvati is sati. Nothing has changed, o shiva. She's willing to accept all your conditions. I've recognised her, brahma. And that's the reason i can't accept sati's re-entry into my life. You're the supreme yogi, o shiva... ...by bestowing the knowledge of yoga upon parvati... ...you can make her worthy of you. Under your guidance... ...she can become worthy, o lord. I don't wish to guide anybody, brahma. My principles are based on renunciation. And i'm following them. Of course... ...we became a little restless. Shiva's isn't mentally stable yet. After the death of kamadeva... ...shiva has become all the more resistant to marriage. The moment that could've been... ...very joyous for parvati... ...has turned into a moment of extreme pain... ...due to shiva's anger. You can't leave me, it's a lie! It's false! - Have courage, rati. Gather yourself. It's all because of you. You! In order to unite you with your husband... ...i lost mine! Why did you leave me and go, my lord? I tried so hard to stop you. So hard! But you... you didn't listen to me. How can i live without you? I won't live. I won't live without you either. Rati... this isn't right. My husband never wanted... ...to use his arrows on a yogi like shiva. It was only because of you... ...that my husband fell prey to shiva's fury. I curse you, o indra! Your throne will never be stable. The clouds of insecurity and threat will always engulf it! Sister... you're also a reason for my plight, parvati. You've deprived me of the pleasure of motherhood. You'll have to bear this misfortune, too. I curse you... ...that you'll never have the pleasure of bearing offsprings. Never! Don't do this, o mother! Don't do this! I share you grief. You have the right to curse me. Rati. This curse will cause the end of creation. If parvati doesn't bear children... ...then it'll never be possible... ...to slay tarakasura. Rati... in all the beautiful things of this world... in fragrant flowers... in love and art, kamadeva will always... ...be present. It's my boon. He'll also be reborn. In my avatar as krishna... ...he'll be born as my son pradyumna. He'll marry you again. Rati... you've to now... ...rectify your curse. I can only reduce the effect of my curse, o lord. Parvati will surely be a mother... ...but she'll not be able to carry her children in her womb. I accept your curse. And my blessings... ...will always be with you. You'll again be kamadeva's wife. And unlike me... ...you'll never be abhorred by your husband. For the benefit of mankind... ...adi shakti... ...will have to be born in a human womb... ...and marry shiva. But... ...every human's birth... ...is tarnished by impurity. Goddess parvati... ...should be free of all impurities. But... ...mother parvati must be aware of it. In the absence of a teacher... ...no knowledge is possible. Even parvati... ...needs such a teacher... ...who will enlighten her on... ...the intricacies of meditation. O lord... who can be the best teacher... ...for parvati? That great man... ...who dedicated his life... ...to devotion and worship. And there's none... ...worthier than you, o son of brahma. Praise be to narayana! O lord, i'll carry out your order. I accept the responsibility for shiva and parvati's... ...union. No, parvati, leave it. It'll sting you, it's a scorpion. It stung you, didn't it? I told you... it's a scorpion, it is his nature to sting. Why did you take it out of the water? Look! Mother... as a scorpion, if it cannot give up its nature of stinging... ...then how do we give up our nature of protecting the weak? I couldn't understand... ...that it's in your nature to love shiva. And nobody... ...can give up their nature. What is it, mother? Why do you look at me like this? I've tolerated the sting. See, i'm fine now. And the pain that we gave you... ...you tolerated that too, didn't you? I've realised everything. Despite my prohibiting... ...none can stop you from... ...uniting with shiva. Nobody can stop you! Marry shiva. But... ...will you be happy with him? My happiness and well-being lies with shiva. I was born to marry shiva. Nandi... mother's love... ...made her stand in front of shiva. But they couldn't unite. That's why, in order to enter shiva's heart... ...mother parvati will have to follow the path of devotion. Then what's the problem in it, sage? The lord is already god to her. In terms of love... ...not devotion. You're the only one in this world... ...who can... ...bring parvati on the path of devotion... ...because your surrender... ...towards shiva and parvati... ...is enriched with love and devotion. That's why, nandi... ...you'll have to inspire parvati to tread on the path of devotion. Alright, sage. I'll do anything... ...for the union of my master and mother. Praise be to narayana! "I wander lost in your thoughts..." "...i sing your praises..." "i'm immersed in your love..." "...you are my god." "I'm immersed in your love..." "...you are my god." "I'm immersed in your love..." cowherd! Which love ballad do you sing? O lady... i'm singing a love ballad... ...and losing myself in my lord's devotion. What are you saying? What does love and devotion have to do with each other? Lady... there's no relationship greater than love and devotion. It's that divine relationship... ...which transforms the lover into god... ...and god becomes a lover. O lady... worldly love can be defeated... ...but when love... ...takes the form of devotion... ...then it's beyond the limitations of victory and defeat. How is this possible? How can you leave the path of love... ...and take to the path of devotion? O lady, neither is there anything to leave nor to take... you just have to accept your lover... ...in the form of god. Then love transforms automatically into devotion. And as soon as love turns into devotion... ...then the lover who is bound by devotion... ...comes running to him. Can we attain our goal... ...by walking the path of devotion and love? Yes. Merge love and devotion... ...and there will be nothing in this world... ...that will be unattainable. Thank you for showing me the path... ...to attain my lord. I'm blessed today, o mother! I could be of some use to you. Just watch, mother... ...this path of your devotion... ...will unite you with shiva. You'll surely unite. Praise be to narayana! Salutations, mother. Salutations, o sage. Sage, i've found the path to my lord. Henceforth, my shiva is my god... ...and i'm his devotee. Even shiva himself cannot stop the union of god and his devotee. And mother, in this task... ...i'll be with you at every step. But sage, what do i have to do to accomplish this? Mother... there are 16 impurities in the human body. And to remove these 16 impurities... ...you'll have to fast for 16 mondays. And that's because... ...monday is the chosen day of shiva. It's his favourite day. I've full faith, o mother... ...that your union with shiva is certain. And mother, if this happens... ...then for many eons to come... ...this penance will be known as the '16-monday penance'. Not just that, for many ages... ...every woman to attain her desired husband... ...will perform... ...this penance under your guidance. It's impossible to attain shiva against his will, parvati. I'll ruin all your attempts. But why, o lord? Why this injustice towards mother parvati? Like all your other devotees... ...she wishes to worship you. And my lord... ...how can you take away the right of worship from a devotee? None is beyond limitations, nandi. Not even god. Even god has his limitations. What could be more compelling for god to stop his devotee from worshipping him? I'm about to begin your worship, o shiva. Bless me that it's concluded successfully. God himself is against this worship. It's a difficult test, mother. Sister... iord, it's you! It's the duty of every brother to help his sister, o sage. Tell me, brother. What's the job? I'm a traveller. I was feeling thirsty, hence i came here. Can i get some water? No, sister. I'll accept the water only... ...when we share a relationship. You've called me your sister. The bond is already established, brother. - Then tie this... ...sacred thread on my wrist and prove it. I'm blessed, o lord... ...to bear witness to this holy incident. In the coming age... ...this day will not be known only for shiva and parvati... ...but also for the love between a brother and sister, o sage. It appears that you're making a shiva linga. But you're unable to make it. Let me help you. I'm your brother now. Hence, it's my duty to help you. Allow me to fulfill my duty. Narayana! What have you done, narayana?! How can one break the shiva linga made by you? O mother... the shiva linga is complete. Let's begin. Who are you? You made the shiva linga so easily. An ordinary man cannot do this. Who are you, who has come to help us? Your brother. Isn't this enough? There's no place for secrets between a brother and sister. I wish to know your true identity. Will you not fulfill this wish of your sister? As you say. Narayana! You're my brother? This brother will always be with you. You'll surely be worthy of shiva. Narayana... i request you... ...to promise this sister... ...that henceforth... ...no attempt... ...should be made to take me closer to shiva. I don't know whether i'll attain shiva or not... ...but in my attempt to attain him... ...even if this body ends... ...then i'll assume that i've attained him. As you wish. In future, no god will help you. But... this shiva linga has been made now. You can begin your worship. The shiva linga, even if made is incomplete. Your help has turned my victory into a loss, o narayana. Your behavious surely differs from that of sati, parvati. You've won despite losing. You've won, parvati. Parvati! Calamity has befallen, dear! - What happened, mother? Serpent-king kandru has attacked our kingdom... ...and enslaved your father. And he has sought... ...your marriage to his son in return for his life. Mother, nothing can go wrong as long as shiva's there. This situation has arised because of shiva. Because of him... it's not his fault, mother. He can never do bad to anybody. And us, being innocent... ...he'll surely help us. Come, mother. I've said it once... as long as i live... ...my daughter parvati... ...will not marry kandru's son. Stop! Free my father. Surely. If you agree to come to the underworld with us... ...and marry the son of serpent-king kandru... ...then i'll surely... ...spare your father. If this is the only option... ...then so be it. Soldiers! Arrange for a palanquin for parvati. O shiva... i've dedicated my entire life to you. If i'm going to the underworld with these demons today... ...then i'm not alone, i'm taking you along. With you as witness, i'm handing over... ...the responsibility of liberating me and my family... ...of all problems. If any harm befalls parvati... ...then you'll be party to it. Because every act of mine... ...is dedicated to you. I bow to thee, o shiva. I bow to thee, o shiva. I bow to thee, o shiva. I bow to thee, o shiva. I bow to thee, o shiva. - Use force! Guards, come forward! I bow to thee, o shiva. I've to protect the sons... ...of tarakasura from shiva's rage. O shiva! Please stop! O lord... as their teacher... ...i apologise to you for their foolishness. O shiva, please forgive them. Lord, please trust me. They'll never ever dream of doing such a thing again. Yes, my lord. Fools! Do you even know what you were about to do? You all have done such a thing today... ...that you're not even fit to seek the lord's mercy. O lord... please forgive them. Forgive them. Their sins aren't worthy of mercy. But i spare them on the request of a teacher like you. Or else... this is shiva... ...i'll marry him. Who are you, o lady? I'm parvati. Your parvati. - Whoever you are, i don't know you. I share no relation with you. You do have a relation, o lord. There's neither any penance without love... ...nor meditation. Neither consciousness nor renunciation. No calamity can befall us as long as shiva lives. He'll surely help us. Forgive me, parvati. I was late to arrive. I promise you, parvati. I'll accept you. I'll accept your penance. I'll personally take you on the path of truth. Parvati's penance is shiva's penance, too. Praise be to narayana! O lord... i'm blessed to hear your words! Shiva is himself, the teacher of the mother. There's nothing more joyous than this. I've agreed to be parvati's teacher, only because... ...the sustenance of creation... ...is completed successfully. I'm aware, o sage... ...that you're not very capable at maintaining secrecy... ...but i request you, o narada... ...that upon regaining her senses... ...parvati shouldn't come to know... ...that i've agreed to be her teacher. Parvati should realise it herself. Yes, do tell her... ...that the solution to one's problem, lies within oneself. Then lord, will you leave without meeting her? I'm always with her, sage. But there's still time for the meeting. Until then, we'll meet as student and teacher. By having shiva for a teacher, not just mother... ...but all creation will be joyous. Praise be to narayana! Narada tells parvati... ...that shiva came to protect her. Mother... ...before leaving, he said... ...that man kind find the solution to his problems... ...within himself. Meaning, the solution to all of man's problems... ...is he, himself. 'Om... ' no, sati. Attempt again. I can't do it. I'll do this only after attending the ceremony. I've found the solution, o sage. The panchagni penance that i couldn't complete as sati... ...i'll complete it now. Start your penance soon, dear. With both your blessings and wishes... ...my confidence has been boosted. I'll proceed to the amarnath cave soon... ...in order to complete my penance. O lord! Parvati should know... ...that beauty can be ugly too. And creation doesn't distinguish it. I'll impart the knowledge of both... ...beauty and ugliness to parvati. Will you all help me in it? These flowers are dear to shiva. Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Thank you for bringing the shiva linga here, o lady. We'll begin its worship now. Wait! What are you doing? Why do you offer these impure things to this holy shiva linga! How can these be impure, lady? Everything in this world has been made by shiva. You're doing things against the norms of worship. Shiva isn't offered meat and blood... ...but milk, dhatura flowers and bilwa leaves. And hymns are chanted in his honour. - Enough, lady! Don't insult me by interrupting my worship. I don't know any hymns. This is my method of worship. Alright. Then worship your shiva linga the way you want to. All shiva lingas are one, o lady. Neither yours, nor mine. I can't bear this discrimination anymore. Please let me offer my oblations. Shiva will not accept these impure things you offer. Would you like to see? Hear that, shiva? This woman says that you won't accept my oblations. Look, i've brought tender meat for you. Accept it... accept it, o shiva. Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Praise be to shiva, the supreme! I apologise for the interruption... ...in your worship. But i request you... ...to allow me to offer my oblations. She has realised her mistake. And it's the culture of shiva's... ...devotees to forgive. Come, lady. Just like how you accepted their oblations... ...similarly, accept our worship too, o lord. What is the reason that shiva accepted your impure meat... ...but not my flowers? Worship is not by method... ...but by devotion and surrender. I too have followed many methods... ...any systems, like you. I performed penances... for years, i tolerated hunger... ...and thirst and remained immersed in devotion. Only then i understood the meaning of this sense. What sense? The sense of liberation from the body. The sense of awareness about destructibility. The sense of equality in the world. You offer flowers to god considering... ...them to be holy and beautiful. But leave them for a day... ...and they'll begin to stink too. The flowers will wither. Bathing... ...will help you cleanse your outside... ...but what about the dirt that your body... ...creates constantly? The differentiation of purity and impurity, is an illusion! Whatever exists in this world... ...belongs to shiva. And what belongs to shiva, is shiva. Meaning... ...it's pure. I've received knowledge of this truth, today. I've to liberate myself from this sense of the body. O teacher, who granted me wisdom... ...please bless me... ...that i may attain my goal. Praise be to shiva, the supreme! Even though you're not near me... ...but your idol resides in my heart. As your memory in this place as my witness... ...i being my penance. Parvati, after your penance, this place... ...will be known for our penances. And for all our devotees, this place... ...will be known... ...as a pilgrimage. I seek your blessing to attain you. O agni... ...my panchagni penance cannot be completed without you. Please appear... ...and help me. On one hand, mother parvati goes deep into meditation. And on the other hand... ...for the benefit of the world and to... ...liberate the souls of his ancestors... ...in search of pure water... ...king bhagiratha approaches shiva. Only the waters of ganga... ...can liberate this world of its sins. It can uplift this world. It can transform earth into a holy land. Go on, bhagiratha... ...proceed to brahmaloka. Ganga resides there. Brahma will surely help you... ...attain your goal. O goddess... i request you... only you can uplift the world. King bhagiratha... ...i can't help you in any manner. Ganga... ganga... your life is for the benefit of the world. Or else, you're without purpose. Even shiva wishes the same. He has asked me to request you... ...to return to earth... ...in order to bring back life. If this is what shiva wishes... ...then i'll surely go to earth. But... only shiva possesses the capability... ...to channelise my force and make it worthy of the earth. Or else, my extreme speed will devastate the earth. My return to earth will only be possible... ...when shiva himself receives my full force. Go on, bhagiratha... ...tell ganga that in order to receive her on earth... ...and to channelise her force... ...i'll receive her in my locks. "Immense power, tremendous speed..." "...shiva received her on his head." "The destroyer of sins, the vanquisher of woes..." "...she's bhagiratha's blessing..." "the places that lie on your course..." "...are all known as holy pilgrimages." O shiva, by your blessing... ...the entire world... ...will receive the fruits of my efforts. For this, i bow to thee... ...on behalf of the earth... ...and its creatures. Your efforts have made me aware... ...of ganga's need on the earth. In the coming future... ...ganga will also be known as bhagirathi, after you. Ganga's significance is beyond compare. The capabilities of this water... ...is to annul the effect of all ill-effects on earth. Those who interrupt the workings of the world... ...in the future, through the powers of the ganga... ...will fall prey to a great war. Man will keep getting submerged... ...in his material life... ...consequently... ...penance and meditation will become rare... ...worship and devotion will lose their value... ...in such times, only ganga will continue... ...to guide man towards his true goal. I seek your promise... ...that ganga's purity... ...and sanctity will be your primary duty. I promise you, o lord... ...that i'll never let ganga's purity diminish. And i'll keep... ...men aware of the greatness of the ganga... ...forever. O goddess... accept my salutations. I've come here only through your efforts, o king. I request you... ...to decide my course. Wherever you go... ...my waters will adopt that course. The fire of parvati's body... ...has conquered the fire element. The five elements that a human body is composed of... ...parvati has liberated herself from one of those elements. What other test does mother have to give, o lord? Conquering the water element. This is extremely important, nandi. Water is used to annul the influences... ...that can harm the earth. After parvati completes this step... ...she'll attain mastery over all the five elements... ...which is the basis of all creation. O lord... the human body has its limits. It has its limits of tolerance. What if mother's body gives up while pursuing... ...such rigorous penance, o lord! Until i complete my penance... ...i'll only eat vegetation. By sacrificing everything you've added... ...a new chapter to your penance, parvati. Henceforth, you'll be known as 'aparna' (sacrificer). To offer it to the shiva linga... ...i don't have the strength left to... ...reach the bilwa leaf and water. Finally, it's time for the union of shiva and parvati. Uma... aparna... parvati... then you... i've tormented you by... ...forcing you to perform such rigorous austerities, parvati. But even i was aware of every moment... ...of pain that you bore. The past is considered the past... ...because it has passed. And what has passed... ...why should we talk of its pain and repentance? We're about to begin a new life. By keeping you away... ...i kept myself away from the joy of uniting with you. But after the completion of your penance... ...i accept you this very moment. I wish to express my gratitude... ...by performing a special ceremony in your honour, o lord. You've helped me in my penance... ...and have remained the witness to it, o doves. I grant you the boon... ...that you'll reside in this pious and holy... ...amarnath cave... ...till the end of time. What is love? Tell me, o shiva. Please tell me the secret of love. What is its true form? What is its future? You're playing the role of my teacher. It's your duty to enlighten me about love. Tell me, o holy one. What is love? You're asking me this, parvati? What's the secret of love? What is its form? You've awakened various forms of love, parvati. I've experienced different forms of love because of you. Your answers are buried in your questions. Can you describe the various forms? In the form of sati, when you gave up your life... ...and went away from me... ...my life... ...my world... ...my duty... ...all became meaningless and baseless. Tears streamed from my eyes. By distancing yourself from me... ...you distanced me from myself, parvati. For our reunion... ...this universe... ...attempting every possibility... ...attempting every ploy... ...our true love is the reason for this. Your rebirth in the form of parvati... ...and compelling me... ...to denounce my renunciation... ...and my being compelled... ...is nothing but love. In the future, through your various forms... ...you'll establish new forms of love. Which form, o shiva? Please list them. Whenever, in the form of annapurna... ...you'll satisfy my hunger without any limitations... ...or as kamakhya... ...when you'll desire me. Then it'll be an experience of love. Whenever, for entertainment... ...you'll defeat me in chess... ...even then, i'll be victorious. Because the joy on your face at that moment... ...will remind me of the completeness of my duty. This is love, parvati. Whenever you'll take up weapons... ...and assume the form of durga... ...and protect and fight for me... ...then it'll be an experience of love. Whenever, in the form of kali, you enact the dance of death... ...and trample my body... ...and you'll realise your mistake... ...you'll stick your tongue out... ...that's love, parvati. Parvati... whenever you'll repeatedly submit to me... ...and make me realise that i'm worthy of you... when you'll reflect my true self... ...and assume the form of my reflection... ...it'll be love, parvati. Has it quenched your thirst... ...and curiosity towards love? Now there's no obstacle... ...no difficulty in our union, parvati. I'll marry you today itself. You're my consort. Our devotees in kailash... ...await the commencement of our married life. Come, parvati... the time has come. Parvati... i can't go to kailash with you. I can't begin our married life. I can't marry you.
