My father was right about you. You're a dope. Talk about dopes! What about this guy following me? Would you just please take me home? If you feel that way, I'll take the shortcut. - Get him! - He's taking the old road to town. The man is driving like a maniac! We'll take him. He must be intoxicated. He's intoxicated? That's a joke. I suppose you're cold sober. You got him, Sam! You crazy fools! Sam, just like that... Side to side. Get off my road! Get out of my way! You don't have to pass them. Look, I just want to get home.

Wipe your fingerprints off that car. - What are we gonna do with the body? - Get in the car and drive! Let's go! Get the motor started! Bailey, you dumb bastard! What are we gonna do with her? Come on, let's go! Jesus, I never figured on no kidnapping. Hurry it up, kid. Call Anna, but don't say anything about the dame. Just say we're hiding out at Johnny's for a couple of days. - A couple of days? - Just tell her a couple of days. That'll be 90 cents. She took six. I got no money. Hello? We'll be out at old Johnny Hutchins' place. You go out pendelton road... Excuse me. Just take it easy, you guys. I'll keep you covered. - Hey, Bailey! - Hey, how you doin'? Goddamn light. Hey, Bailey, how you been? - Ain't complainin', Eddie. - That's my boy, Bailey. Lookie here, a car full of real desperadoes. - Hi, Sam. - Hi, Eddie. Big boss man Frankie Connor in person. And that is some real classy-lookin' broad you got there. Pretty high-class for the likes of you, ain't she? Hey, woppy! Get a load of this. Nice seein' you, Eddie. Boy, she's had a skinful. She ain't gonna have to take on the three of you, is she? Are you kidding? I guess we better get goin'. You boys in a hurry? What makes you think that, Eddie? We just gotta get this kid home. Can I help you, mister? Yeah, I've blown a headlight bulb. You got a replacement? Let me see. What is that, a new packard? - Yeah. - Yeah, I think I can help you. We interrupt the program to bring you a special news flash. Millionaire's son and former star college football fullback Jerry mcgowan was found shot to death two miles north of Kansas City earlier tonight. His bullet-riddled body was found beside a dirt road near the Anderson farm on route 3. The car he was driving was found deserted nearby. The girl Jerry mcgowan was escorting, miss Barbara blandish, 21-year-old daughter of prominent Missouri socialite John blandish, is reported missing. Since then, no trace has been found of her, nor has she tried to communicate in any way with her father or the police. The police suspect kidnapping, although no ransom demand has yet been made. More details on the big news in 15 minutes. And now, back to the fabulous music of Henry busse and his band from the edgewater beach hotel. Guess this is it. You got any idea where those friends of mine were headed? The guys who just took off? No, I wouldn't, sir. They didn't let on? Well, I heard one of the fellas on the phone. Yeah? Yeah, he said he was going to... Where was it? Johnny hitchins' place. Hitchins? Hutchins' place. Does that mean anything to you? No, kid. How much is the bulb? - Twelve cents. - Here. Keep the change. I gotta use your phone. - Come on, Johnny, open up! - Who are you? Open the goddamn door before I put a slug through it! - I didn't recognize your voice. - It's okay! Come on, lady, move. If you open your mouth, I'll blow your goddamn head off. We ain't gonna have no trouble, Johnny. We just lookin' for a place to hide out for a while. Ransom... She okay, Sam? Yeah, she's still asleep. Oh, Jesus. Bailey. Bailey, look. See what they want. Go on, get out there. Get out there! You boys were in some hurry last night. Tryin' to get that crazy drunken dame back home. This her country place? She don't live here. You know something, Bailey? I already guessed that. Connor inside? - I'll get him. - No, no. Stay here. Just ask him to step outside a minute. Hey, frank? Frank, come out here. Do you hear me, Connor?! Come out here, will ya?! We was just askin' about the girlfriend, Connor. Like he told you, we dropped her off. Why is he lyin' like that? What's he lying to us for? I ain't lyin'. He is lying. They got her. They got her right up there. They got her. Good, Johnny. I'll tell you what you do. You go right up there and bring her down here. With pleasure. Connor, why do you want to lie like that? I mean, didn't your folks teach you no better? Slim, we got a necklace worth 50 grand. Now, the girl's worth anything you ask. Now, listen to me. We'll keep the rocks and you guys take the girl. Slim, that's a fair deal. Well, I don't know. I et's see the rocks. Okay. Like ma says, they's real punks. Let's see the rocks, Bailey. They's pretty. Yeah! What's she screamin' for? Well, stop her screaming! Come on, stop screamin'! Cut it out! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! We're not gonna hurt you. We're gonna look after you. This is your necklace, ain't it? Well, here, I'll give it back to you. Ain't that proof we ain't gonna hurt you? Go on. I'm giving it back to you. Come on, girlie. He's givin' you a present. Go on, take it. You want me to put it on for you? All right, I'll put it on for you. You sure got pretty hair. Watch out! - Is anybody else in there? - Not a soul. Woppy, go with Johnny and check it out. Let's go, Johnny. Mace, take your buddy there for a walk. Now! Move. Come on, move. - Please, mace. - Shut up. Mace, you and me... We go back a long way. Joe, take a sock at me and run like hell. Go ahead. Give me a break, slim. I'm okay. Ask mace. I don't go shootin' my trap off. You see what I was telling you, miss? We come to protect you. Them other fellers, them was really stupid people. But we gonna look after you. Okay? Like he says, slim, not a soul. Well, let's get outta here. What about Johnny? He used to be a fighter. Eddie, you look after our old buddy Johnny there. Don't you worry, miss. We'll look out for you. Don't do it. Clean up the place, Johnny. Dump the car in the lake, dig a hole, and get rid of these monkeys. Then buy yourself some good liquor and don't go out for a while. Do you hear what I'm saying, Johnny? Just leave it to old Johnny. I'm sure there won't be any trouble. I'm sure we can solve this to everybody's satisfaction. Would it be possible for me to phone my father? I'm sure he'll pay whatever you ask. You really think so, dearie? How much do you think daddy will pay? A million dollars? Do you think your daddy will shell out a million bucks to get his precious baby back? - Ma, a million bucks? - That's right, a million dollars. How about that, Eddie? A million bucks! What if he doesn't? Oh, come on, dearie. Come on! You just see'd what happened to them three punks. I mean, we ain't the kind of people who fool around. Get it, dearie?! Well, now... It ain't exactly a custom to have a weekend houseguest. But we intend to look after you the very best we can. No trouble from you, we'll treat you like one of the family. Eddie, will you show the young lady up to our guest room? My pleasure, ma. But which room... What's the guest room? She's gonna have my room, slim. I'm moving back in with your mother. I'll show her up, ma. Eddie can do it, slim. I said I'd show her up. Okay, slim. Right. Now you two run along and play. You run out of games, slim, you let me know. "If you run out of..." You kill me! What's that supposed to mean? What? Well, what's it supposed to mean? Oh, that. That was just a little joke like you hear on the radio show. - Well, I don't get the joke. - He don't get the joke! He kills me. Your mother said for you two to run along and play, so I said, "if..." Forget it, slim. Never mind, slim. Eddie's jokes ain't funny today. - Jokes is meant to be funny. - That's right. There ain't no point in them otherwise. That's right. Now run along. You know, Gladys, that's a very pretty girl. Sure is. Yeah. But don't any of you guys think you're gonna play with her. Slim got the concession, ma? Slim? You know slim never messed around with a woman his whole life. Yeah? What you figure he's doing up there now? - You got a dirty mind, Eddie. - Are you kidding? Slim ain't took his eyes off that broad since we got to Johnny's. - Isn't that the truth, mace? - That's the truth, ma. Woppy? That's right, ma. You saw it yourself. He even give her the necklace back. Right now that's the least of our worries. Let me tell you a remarkable thing about kidnappers... They nearly always end up getting caught. He's right, ma. Let me tell you something about kidnappers. The only time they get caught is after they hand back the party they snatched, and that ain't gonna happen to us because we ain't gonna do no handin' back. After we get the dough... We kill the girl. It's gotta be done. We've gotta kill the girl. Here they come down the stretch and heading for home. It's Jeremy joy in the lead by half a length. It's Mickey Lynn a nose behind in second... What do you want? If you've come about the rent, you'd better catch the end of this race. I haven't called about the rent. Swear it! And the winner... Hey Betty by a nose! Jeremy joy second, with Mickey Lynn coming in third. You are Mr. fenner? Hey Betty the winner with jockey Alan metcalf on top. In second place... Some guys think the jockeys are crooked. After that result, you gotta figure it's the horses. My name is John p... I've seen your pictures, Mr. blandish. If you brought your own cup, you can have a drink. No, thank you. Chief mclaine suggested that I get in touch with you. He recommended you as being hard-working and trustworthy. Did he say all that about me? He said you might make a useful go-between. Then they've asked you for the ransom dough? Jesus Christ. A million dollars... that's pretty impressive just reading about it. Are you refusing this assignment, Mr. fenner? Mr. blandish, the last time anybody walked through that door and offered me a job was two months ago. Now, if you want me to deliver the ransom money, I'll deliver it. How much do I get? Captain mclaine suggested your services would be available for $200. Well, as you probably guessed, mclaine is a real pal of mine. - All right, 200 it is. - Thank you, Mr. fenner. I expect to receive final instructions tomorrow. We'll go to the bank, collect the money, and you will deliver it at the appropriate time. I ain't all that crazy about food. As a matter of fact, I hardly ever eat at all, except for the pies my ma makes. And cookies. She makes some really great cookies. Your ma make good cookies? Well? Does she? I can't remember. Have you heard from my father yet? Well, not yet, but... Doc wrote him a letter. Well, don't you worry about it. - You wanna try a cookie? - No. These are cookies my ma made. You know how many of 'em I ate already? I ate about 12 of 'em today. You know something? I never did ask you your first name. Barbara. That's a real pretty name. - What'd you do that for? - I told you before, don't touch me. What's wrong with touching you? There ain't nothin' wrong with touching. You know something? I'm stronger than you. Yes, I am. I'm so strong, I bet I could kiss you. I was just playin' a little game. A little kiss. Why won't you let me kiss you? Why? Because you're odious, that's why. Look at you... You're filthy and you smell. Do you really think I'd let a cretinous half-wit like you touch me? What'd you call me? Cretin! Half-wit! Simpleton! Get out of here, you dirty, filthy pig! You filthy... get out of here! I hate you! Stay out! Stay away from me! Get out of here, you dirty swine! Get out! You make my skin crawl! You make me wanna throw up! She's sayin' bad things, ma! Now calm down and tell me what this is all about. - She's sayin' bad things! - Take it easy, slim! You promised me you'd make her my friend. You promised! And now all she's doin' is sayin' bad things, ma. She said I smell! She called me a cretin and a half-wit and things! She said I'm odious, ma! - Take it easy, son. - You promised! Take it easy. Ma, you promised! You promised. Is it true? Ma, you said you'd make her my friend. You promised! What are you gonna do? Get your ass back in there, dearie. You uppity little bitch. Don't suppose nobody ever give you a real good beatin', did they? Now... You gonna be nice to my slim... Dearie? You miserable cow. Do you really think I'd let your boy lay a hand on me? I'd burn in hell first. You're savin' it all up for some rich husband, huh? You know what you are? You're filth. You're scum. You and your idiot son. Come on, now, dearie. No need for you to go callin' us names just 'cause we're ordinary folks. You want me to hit you some more? 'Cause if you don't, you better get nice and friendly with slim. Get it, dearie? You give me a pain in the head. Hit me, will ya? You dirty... I'm convinced your mother would have given dempsey a pretty good contest. Somebody help me! Help! Please don't! No! Goddamn it! You know, you really are a funny kind of a person. I'm talkin' to you! You want me to get doc to take a look at you? Ma said for you to be nice to me. Now, you be nice to me. You hear? Yeah? Who is it? It's me... heinie. Jesus. It's a little early for a visit, isn't it? You forget I work half the night? Hi, Anna. Can I come in? What for? Look, I just wanna talk to you. Did you hear from Frankie? Did I hear what from Frankie? Well, Frankie owes me, right? And I didn't know they were gonna snatch the dame! Snatch? What dame”? The blandish dame! Don't you read the papers? It says they're askin' a million bucks. It says my Frankie's askin' a million bucks? No, sweetheart, it doesn't say Frankie's askin'. Not by name, it doesn't say. I didn't know they were gonna snatch the girl. I mean, kidnapping... That's serious business. She falls under a bus while they got her, that's a capital offense. - What's a capital offense? - The death penalty. Jesus, they hang you for that? What the hell is this country coming to? You got any extra booze, Anna? My nerves is really bad. Here. You want a rum truffle? It's okay if I get a glass of water, ain't it? I just wanted to make sure you didn't say anything. Me say anything? You think I'd turn my own guy in? I didn't say that. I just mean we gotta be careful. Well, that goes for you, too, heinie. So don't get any ideas about turning canary. - I'd die first. - You sure would if Frankie ever got to hear about it. A million bucks! A million bucks! - What do you think? - That's right, mace. One million big ones! Everybody through lookin' and touchin'? Eddie, woppy, will you cart this stuff into that other room? Watch it, watch it. - Gentle. - Heavy, huh? Why do I always get the heavy end? Easy, easy. Hey, ma, when do we split all this? Split? In about a year. In about a year. You're kiddin'. Nope. Right now, this dough's about as useful to us as a $4 bill. Ma, what the hell are you talkin' about? - That makes sense, mace. - It don't make sense to me. You think a bank hands out a million bucks and don't keep a check of the numbers? We made a deal. A certain party is prepared to give us 400,000 clean ones - in exchange for this. - Are you crazy? 400,000? - We got a million... - What the hell you beef in' at? Yesterday you was bumming a nickel for coffee. - Ma, we got a million dollars. - Shut up, mace. Listen to what ma has to say. You'll all get spending money. Don't worry! 400,000 means we go big time, legitimate. We're going into the nightclub business. As long as prohibition lasts, we make big dough. And if prohibition ends, we're in the gambling business. Like Mr. hoover says, prosperity is just around the corner. We'll be on the ground floor. Believe me, that is sound economics. All you guys gotta remember is you each got 66 grand invested. What do you think, Eddie? I think I ain't never had 66 grand before. That's what I think. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You look at it that way? - It's the only way to look at it. - What about the dame? - She'll be outta here in a few days. - Why not right away? - 'Cause I say so, Eddie. What you tryin' to do, ma, make a man out of slim? She'll be out of here in a few days. You don't like what slim's doin', maybe you should have a word with him. Ladies ain't supposed to drink. Not hard liquor. Is that a fact? As I recall, you don't know very much about ladies either. I know that much. Yes, I do. Well, this lady likes to drink. In fact, at this very moment, this lady would like a dry... Dry... very dry Martini. A dry Martini? If you don't mind. And don't forget the olive. - Olive? - That's right, an olive. This is why I always look forward to Wednesday night, lads. - It looks very good. - It looks good, ma, real good. Stop talkin' and pass it to me. You gonna join us for a little celebration, slim? What kind of celebration? A celebration on account of everything's hunky-dory, slim. Except for getting rid of the broad. What's he talkin' about? You know, slim... Bumpin' off the broad. Ma, didn't you tell slim about that? Is he talkin' about killin" that girl? Is that what he's talkin' about? Shall we discuss this after supper, slim? We gotta do it, son. You touch that girl, and I'll kill you. I'll kill anybody that touches her! Your mother's right. As long as she's alive, we're in danger. - I don't care. - Come on now, slim. You had your fun. Shut your face! You hear me? Shut your goddamn face! Did I ever do anything bad for you, slim? That's right, now you pay attention to your mother, slim. You ain't takin' her away. You ain't! We kept out of trouble for a long time 'cause everybody figured ma knows best. Do you think I want to see a boy of mine lose his head over some fool girl? I wouldn't let them do it. I sure as hell ain't gonna let you... You think I wouldn't? God forgive me. If I could kill my own ma, I could kill anybody. You guys hear that? That girl is mine! She stays with me! You got that clear? Okay. Everybody knows the score. She's staying with me! Okay? Doc, how you make a dry Martini? Martini? You need gin, you need vermouth. You need an olive, don't you? I believe that's right. - We got some gin. - Let's get it. We got some Coca-Cola. Maybe she'd like to have some coke in it. Why ain't we got no vermouth? There's not a lot of call for it around this house. - I want you to get some. - Sure. Here's your gin. Coke. - And an olive. - An olive? I want you to buy a goddamn olive. Sure thing, slim. Next time we go for groceries, we'll get some olives. He'll get over it. Sure he will. - Just leave it a few days. - A few days, sure. Yeah. A few days. Sure, ma. After all, slim's a good boy. Always does what his mother tells him. Pass the potatoes, mace. Break! I know how you feel, rocky. You want time to think it over. Okay, you can have time. We'll see you tomorrow evening, about 6:00. Okay, ma. I'll think it over. I don't stay out late. Don't care to go I'm home about 8:00, me and my radio. Ain't misbehavin' ain't misbehavin' 'cause I'm savin' my love for you Anna, will you knock it off for a while? Okay, boys. Rocky, who's the broad? Anna borg. She knocks around with Frankie Connor. You know Frankie? He used to operate out of St. Louis. - Thanks, fellas. - How about an intro, rocky? I want you to meet ma Grissom, doc. And this here is Eddie hagan. - Hi. - Hiya. We're gonna be takin' a little interest in this place, honey. Maybe we can talk about your act sometime. Well, you know what they say... "No time like the present.” Nice to meet you. You concentrate on handlin' what you got, Romeo. Mind if I get changed? Anything I can do to help? Maybe we can figure something out. You look cute, Eddie. Why don't you fix yourself a drink? Thanks. - Can I make you one? - No. You gotta work pretty hard in your racket, don't you? Yeah. Well, it always pays to rehearse. I guess so. Okay, smart-ass. What happened to my Frankie? - What are you talkin' about? - Cut the crap! You ran into Frankie a couple of weeks ago. He ain't been seen since. Listen, gorgeous, put that heater away. I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off! Yeah, yeah, I saw Frankie. I heard he took a shine to the blandish dame and skipped town. He what? Took a shine to the blandish dame and skipped town. Okay, baby, now we can talk pretty. The word is that Frankie don't want to hand the dame back. Who told you that? Heinie? Heinie the picture-taker? I'm not sayin' nothin'. Well, it guess they ran out on old heinie, too. He the one who told you about me seein' Frankie? No. A kid at a gas station. I don't believe my Frankie would run off with that dame. Look, honey, it's just a rumor going around. For my money, Frankie's always been a straight guy. They're just layin' low. He'll get in touch with you. That double-crossing bastard! Come on now, honey. I wouldn't be too tough on the guy. You don't know. I lived with that stumblebum for two years. I gave him two of the best years of my life. I'd say you've still got quite a few good years left. You want this back? If I hear anything, I'll... Come around and tell you about it. Okay. I ain't kiddin', sweetheart. I mean... I'd really like to see you again. Okay? Yeah, okay. Okay. Yes, sir. Can I help you fellas? - Hiya, heinie. - Hello. Hi. Got a little something we'd like to talk over with you. I was just gonna take a picture of the young lady. You can take it later. I'm sure you won't mind, will you? No. - I'll just put my camera... - No, no, no. Just give it to woppy. He'll take care of it for you. Woppy, huh? There you are, woppy. Maybe we can go someplace where it's quiet, like the toilet. Yeah. Yeah. That's okay, go ahead. - Would you mind holding this? - No, not at all. Be back in a couple of minutes. - You got a nickel? - Yeah. Thanks. I'm gonna call the cops. You're gonna tell 'em what you know about the blandish snatch. I don't know a thing. You know about Connor and Bailey, so you're gonna tell the cops. Give me the police. It's important. Let me in! Out of order! Come back in five minutes. I don't understand, fellas. Honest. Look, I didn't make a cent out of that whole thing! Just a minute. Give 'em the message, heinie. You'll be doing us a favor. Hello, police? I got some information on the blandish case. Frank Connor and Joe Bailey... Just the names, heinie. Cops are pretty smart. They can figure it out for themselves. Yeah, I guess so. Okay if I go now? I got customers waiting. A fella's gotta make a living, right? I don't get this. I wouldn't do anything against you guys. Not friends... I wouldn't hurt a friend. Look, fellas... You know old heinie. I like helping people. I'll do anybody a good turn. What do you think, Eddie? You think slim made it with the dame yet? Been up there enough times. I'm surprised he went to town with ma and doc. - Kind of disgusts you, don't it? - What? Killing the dame is one thing, but letting slim climb all over her, it ain't right. It just ain't right. You're a good-looking broad like that and you got a monkey like slim all over you, I think you're better off dead. It'll cost you 200, woppy. You got the key? I fold. What do you want it for? Maybe she ain't feelin' too good. Somebody ought to see if she's okay. That's right. Mace, give me the key. I'll go up- - Eddie, I don't know. - You heard him. It must be pretty lonesome up there for a girl by herself. Especially one so good-lookin'. You all right, miss? I'd like another drink. Sure, sure. You wait right there. Boy, is she loaded. She wants some more booze. Eddie, you're not goin' up there, are you? You stay here, mace. You hear slim comin', you just give a holler. Eddie, what are you gonna do? Just bein' nice and sociable. For chrissake, Eddie, she's just a kid! Got to learn the facts of life sometime. Woppy says you're thirsty. We're fresh out of Martini to go with this. Well, it tastes pretty good just the way it is. Slim been treatin' you okay? You know what he reminds me of? He reminds me of a slug. A creepy, crawly slug. He sure has been creepy-crawlying up here a lot. Yes, he has. - What's your name? - Eddie. And mine's woppy- hello, woppy- aren't you a happy-looking fella. Well, Eddie, I wanna ask you something. Shoot, baby. Why won't they let me go? We can't let you go until your old man pays the ransom. I don't believe it hasn't been paid, Eddie. It's been too long. These business shenanigans take a lot of time, a lot of organization. That's right, miss... Lots of organization. Well, why don't you just let me phone my father? I mean, you... Do you like creepy, crawly, sluggy slim? You could just take me away and have all the ransom money to yourself. Now, isn't that a nice idea? That wouldn't be right, would it? Be kind of like cheatin'. I just don't want that slim coming up here again. I wouldn't worry about that, baby. I just wanna get away from here. Please help me. Eddie, it's slim! Eddie, it's slim! Slim! It's slim! Hiya, slim. What was you guys doing up there? We was talkin', slim. What were they doin' up there? Like they said, they was just chewin' the fat, slim. That's a fact, slim. We heard a noise. We were just checkin' if she was okay. What'd those guys do? Did you mess around with those guys? Hey, I'm talkin' to you! Classy broad. Those guys touch you? Did that Eddie touch you? He was charming. Very charming. Charming? Charming? He only wants to kill ya! That's all he wants to do! Did you hear that? Those are guys who want you out of the way! And you know who saved you? Me! I'm the one who saved you! Then the money has been paid. You're goddamn right the money has been paid. No one ever called me a mug. No one ever called slim Grissom a mug! And now... Goddamn it, you make me out a mug! Eddie, them others... They want to kill you. My ma wants to kill you! Yeah. My own ma. Did you hear what I said? Liquor. Ladies ain't supposed to drink hard liquor! But why? I can't harm them. Harm them? No. All you can do is get us all hung, can't you? Oh, god. Oh, my god. Oh, god. You'll be okay. I said I'd look after you, didn't I? Why won't they trust me? I won't say anything. I promise. Please let me go. Please. My father will pay more money. You just ask him. He'll promise not to go to the police. It ain't got nothin' to do with me. Then let me speak to your mother. My ma wants you dead. What else can I promise? Slim, I'm beggin' you. You'd be dead already except for me. Then what are you gonna do? Keep me here forever? Yeah. I guess I am. It's better than bein' dead, ain't it? What happens if you don't... Want me around anymore? That's kind of up to you, ain't it? You start hollerin' at me and callin' me names... I ain't gonna like that. Am I? I guess you gotta start bein' nice to me. You think you can do that? I think so. Are you sure? Yes... I'm sure. Ain't nothin' to worry about, then. I really can be... Nice to you. I better see about some chow. Please stay. Please. Morning. How are you today? Looks like it's gonna be a real nice day. Yes, ma'am. A real nice day. You ain't mad about nothin', are you? You ain't mad about last night, are you? Well, I didn't force you or anything. What's the matter? You ain't still worried about them others, are you? I mean, I told you, I ain't gonna let 'em do anything to you. Not now. Especially not now. Not seein' as how I love you. I didn't say you had to love me back. But you can like me, can't you? After last night and all, it... I saved your life. You gotta like a fella for that. It's slim's car, ain't it? - Any of you guys been up there? - No, slim, nobody. Honest. Eddie, what you think about the suit? The what? The suit. Turn around. Well? It's all right, ain't it? It's a... classic. A what? It's a classic. Who made it, the Ford motor company? That ain't funny. Ford don't make suits. Slim, I was just kiddin". On you, that suit looks good. Woppy couldn't wear a suit like that "cause he's too fat. You know what? Woppy couldn't fit in a Ford tractor. Now, you think about that one, woppy. What's so fuckin' funny? Surprise! Got a new suit. Eddie reckons it's a classic. Oh, I'm sure it is. Got these for you. Why don't you open 'em? Why don't you open them? The guys we want... Connor... Bailey. We know they were seen out at the roadhouse. Connor and Bailey disappear... Mexico City, California, Buenos Aires... We don't have the slightest idea where. Some of the ransom dough has been circulated. One link... Anna borg, Connor's girlfriend. She's been grilled, tailed, bullied. She won't give a cop the right time of day. Where's she hang out? Rocky neilson's old club. She's a singer. Ma Grissom's gang's been runnin' the place for a couple of months. All right. Forget it. Don't you think we've tried? There's just one thing sure in this case... The blandish girl is dead. Yes, sir. It's real elegant. Look at this. You know how long we've been workin' on this? About two months... Night and day, even Sundays. All this furniture is imported from out of state. Look at that bed. It's a got a double mattress on it. And box Springs... Gives it a real bounce. No windows? That don't matter. We got us some air conditioning. Look at that. Have you ever seen anything like that? It's just like in @ movie house. I ook over here. This is the cat's meow. You're gonna love this. Look at that. See those towels? Got our initials on 'em. Look here. It's got hot water. You can take a bath. Got some perfumed soap for you. Look at that. And look here. Ain't that the greatest thing you ever did see? Gold-leaf flush toilet. Look. You can sit on it, close the door. I've been saving this one for you. We worked on this for a long time. Watch this. Slidin' doors. It's our own kitchen. Look at that sink. Ain't that somethin'? We got a new frigidaire. You get ice cubes in it. And look here... olives. Got a stove. Got pots and pans. You can cook us up something real nice. Me? Sure. Ma and woppy can't cook for us the rest of our life. Not now... Now that we got our own apartment and all. I don't cook. - How about a steak? - Steaks would be nice. With baked potatoes. Now for the second favor, rocky. Just tell her that a guy from a big New York agency caught her act and really loved it. - Yeah, but I... - Just do it. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the new rocky's takes great pleasure in presenting miss Anna borg! That's her now. We've played the game. Of stay-away. But it cost more. Than I can pay. Without you I can't make my way. I surrender, dear. I may seem proud I may act gay. It's just a pose I'm not that way. 'Cause deep down in my heart I say. I surrender, dear. How come you never get your ass outta bed? Well, it's the place you seem to like it the most. I wouldn't give you 6 to 5 on that, sweetheart. I thought you were gonna take me to the races today. I was. I entered you in the fifth race, but the stewards objected. Oh, Jesus. Now we got the w.C. Fields show. I gotta go to a business meetin'. Great! How come I don't get to go anywhere anymore? - How come? - Yeah, how come? 'Cause you always open your big trap and embarrass me. Jesus Christ! Catch. You goddamn punk! Get your ass out of here! Go back to your pigsty, you dirty bastard! Get lost, you crumb-face! Get lost, you dumb asshole! Miss borg. Could I see you for just a moment, miss borg? Jesus. Now we got the Fuller brush man. I said I'm comin'. Will you keep your pants on? Okay, buster, what's your pitch? - Miss Anna borg? - Who wants to know? I'm from Lucas, Herman & Heller, the New York theatrical agency. Oh, sure. If I could come in, I have a proposition to make you. Mister, I've had more propositions than you've had cups of coffee. Well, this one happens to be genuine. I was at the club last night. Didn't rocky tell you? The agent! - Come in! - Thank you. - Here, sit down. - Thank you. Look at that. Some joker. It's not loaded, you know. This is going to sound like something you read in true romances, but... A client of Lucas, Herman & Heller's is putting together a show for Broadway. This Missouri millionaire has seen your act more times than you'd believe, and he's suggested... No, in fact he has insisted that you be one of the stars of the show. - Me? - That's right. He admires your work and... Is this some kind of gag? No, this is the way it happens in show business, miss borg. Obviously, you would have to audition and everything. In New York? Naturally, we'd pick up the tab. - You want me to sing and dance? - And be beautiful. Do I know this guy, this millionaire? I figure he's got some ideas in that direction. They got a leading man? - They sure have. - Yeah? Who is it? Miss borg, hold on to your hat. Yeah? Rudy vallee. Rudy vallee? The vagabond lover... Rudy vallee, yes. Rudy vallee... And me? We're gonna sing together? You sure are. That's fantastic! It's just like you said... It's right out of true romances. What do we do next? You can appreciate that a Broadway appearance leads to newspapers and the radio showing great interest. - I don't mind that. - I know. May I call you Anna? Of course. My pleasure. Newspapers can really hurt a star. Would you sit down? Newspapers can really hurt a star. I'm just gonna have to be frank with you. We're kind of worried about some of your past associations. People like... The guy in this blandish case. Connor. Is that his name? Frankie Connor? So what? Ain't a star entitled to a private life? Would that it was so, Anna. Anyway, we've been into this with our publicity people. They've come up with a good angle. Yeah? What is it? A small-town girl gets mixed up with the wrong crowd. Yeah! And she decides to reform. And she gives the police some little bit of information, some clue that breaks the whole case wide open. What do you think I am, a stoolie? Anna, that is not being a stoolie. That is doing your duty as a citizen. What do I know? I don't know nothin' about it. Didn't you talk to Connor after the snatch? What if I did? Did he call you? I don't think he had anything to do with this blandish case. - Where did he call you from? - Johnny Hutchins', his place. Did you tell that to the police? What the hell is this? Are you a cop? I told you, I'm from Lucas, Herman & Heller. Yeah, well, I never heard of them three guys. Come on, Anna, open up. I just went out without my goddamn heater. Anna very thoughtfully wrapped it up for you in her nightie. It's right there. If I were you, I wouldn't try to get it, Eddie. - What are you doing here, fenner? - Fenner? You know him? You ain't been shootin' off your big fat trap? Anna's been real friendly. Well, I think I'll be runnin' along. You miserable bastard! You all right? - Give my regards to Broadway. - You goddamn punk! Come on. Are you all right? What'd that guy want? He gave me some silly crap about being in show business. Then he starts asking questions about the blandish case. I'll get you a towel. I'll take care of you. The blandish case? - What kind of questions? - What? What kind of questions about the blandish case? Just some stuff about Frankie. Here. - Do you want a drink? - No. Go get me some ice. I got plenty of ice. What stuff about Frankie? Just if I talked to him after the snatch. - What'd you tell him? - So I told him... Give me that. I told him that I did talk to Frankie. Frankie called me from old Johnny's place. You told him what? What the hell do I owe Frankie for? He ran out on me. Here. You dumb broad. What are you tryin' to do, ruin the whole thing? Ruin what whole thing? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What thing? Shut up! Did you know my Frankie was out there? Did you? Shut up! How come you know so much about it? What did you do to Frankie? I told you you was gonna ruin the whole thing. I ruined it? You bastard! You bastard! What did you do to... Dumb Anna. You were really dumb. Give me the gun, Johnny. Okay, let's go inside. Who tipped you off I was comin' out today, Johnny? Okay, Johnny. I want to talk about the night Frankie came with the blandish girl. Man, I ain't got nothin' to tell you. Johnny, listen to me. We can do this the hard way or we can do it the easy way. It's your choice. Everybody knows that my... My memory is real bad. Okay, Johnny. You like it out here, Johnny? They break up this blandish case, you go straight to the can. How'd you like to wind up your days in jail? Johnny, just once... Just once, why don't you wind up ahead of the game? Have they paid you off yet? There's a big reward, Johnny. You'll get a piece of it. Ti will? Did Frankie Connor and Joe Bailey come out here that night? They still here. I buried them myself out the back. Who killed them? Maybe you'd better ask slim Grissom about that. Now, woppy- - You all right, woppy? - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Give me the pineapple. Got 'em both. Cops! Cops! Slim, woppy, it's the cops! The cops are comin'! Come on! Come on! Come on! They're right behind us! Come on! - Get in there! - Watch my shoulder! Come on, follow 'em! Come on, let's go in. Jesus Christ, look at this! Doug, give me a hand here. Hey, fenner. Hey, fenner, come on, it's time to get up. Come on, let's go. Come on. Everything's all right. Come on, let's get going. Where is she, ma? Where is she?! Eddie took her. You really guzzle this stuff down. - What about the cops? - Sure. What kind of deal you think I'd get from them? No, you don't leave my sight. Not until your old man says we got a deal. Slim will kill you. Yeah? Where you think slim will be, baby? In jail... that's where. He ain't gonna be killin" nobody. I'm gettin' you out of this mess, and you don't seem crazy about it. Just exactly what did you and slim do all that time? We danced. You get a taste for all those days and nights with him? I'm talkin' about makin' a deal. Maybe your old man won't be too keen on gettin' you back. You ain't exactly the same package he paid a million bucks for. Not anymore, you ain't. - Leave me alone. - Don't worry about me, sweetheart. I'm a broad-minded guy. Come on, sweetheart, we got time. Come on, what the hell's the difference? - You let slim do it, didn't you? - I had to! Well, now you don't have to. But you're gonna. That's it, sweetheart. You should've turned the lights out. You don't understand. Ma wanted her killed, slim. Honest, slim. That's the truth. Fancy dresser, huh? Always thought you were a fancy dresser. You don't look so fancy now. I told him you'd kill him, fix your dress. Fix your dress. Tell the sergeant we're going in in two minutes. Ma, they got the back covered, too. We have to fight it out. Okay. We fight it out. I'll cover from here, ma. I've never been much of a one for shooting. You ain't gonna run out on us, are you, doc? Gladys, you just can't take on the whole Kansas City police force. If you don't like the stakes, you shouldn't play the game. This is police chief mclaine talking. The club's surrounded. You have exactly two minutes... Two minutes to come out with your hands up. If not, we bust in. Do you hear that? Two minutes from... now. - You heard what the man said. - Gladys, be reasonable. We go out, we got a chance. They still gotta prove us guilty. I've looked after you for a long time. Now you'll just... Have to look after yourself. One minute. Sure. I'm sorry, Gladys. See ya. What the hell was that? - The blandish girl! - And slim Grissom! You troopers, get that car! All right, let's go. Get over here! Get on that spotlight! Get your light on the window! Come on! Come on over here! Shine it on the lower window! Get down! Get down! Come on, get that ram over there! Get inside! Hurry with that! Move in with that! Hurry! Come on! Bastards! Come on! Clean out that room! More men! Come on! Keep those reporters down here. I don't want them wandering around. Watch it. Let the coroner through. The fellas at the weather bureau ain't always right when it comes to predictin'. Let's hope they got the right man on that one supposedly comin' in from the north tomorrow night. My wife said if we don't get some wet pretty soon, she's gonna try one of them cherokee rain dances she learned while she was teaching braves back in the Indian nation. Yes, sir, young fella, what can I do for you? Fill her up. Take me just a minute. I gotta fill up the pump. You folks stay listening to kbex. Kbex is your friendly station, you hear? When we get more details about that big downtown gun battle, y'all are gonna be the first to know. Boy, that was some shootout. Old pardy tubbs called in to say there's more bullets flyin' around than ticks on a hot cow's back. That's enough wind-makin'. Let's get some guitar-whompin' and country music on the air. How was that about a gun battle? The police killed 'em all. Four of 'em, I think. What about ma? Ma? Feller did say there was a woman killed in the shootin'. They killed ma. That's the kind of people we're dealin' with, see? They killed an old lady. I mean, what do I do now? I'm tellin' you, they... That's real sad, ain't it? I loved my ma! Boy, this is some layout. Quite a switch, huh, fenner? I still can't believe it. Yeah, Romeo and Juliet. Say, this is real comfy. Tell me, you think she really fell for that half-wit? I mean, after all, this is a real love nest. I read about these society broads somewhere. A lot of 'em just wanna get laid by truck drivers... Big, dirty, sweaty guys. How about cops? Fenner, come on. I don't see any ball and chain around here. All this fancy stuff. Take a look. She wasn't exactly on bread and water. There's a double lock outside that door. What about these windows? Who knows? Maybe they were scared of burglars. - What are you gonna... - This way, sir. Mr. blandish. Captain mclaine. Mr. fenner, the phone message said my daughter's alive. Yes, sir. You've seen her? She was in a car with Grissom. After all this time? I don't believe it. This was their room, Mr. blandish. She was living here with Grissom. Kind of like man and wife. That's a monstrous thing to say, captain mcllaine. Take a look. What the captain is trying to say is it looks as though... She was forced to stay in this room with Grissom. You don't know much about my daughter, Mr. fenner. She would certainly never tolerate anything like this. I don't think she had much choice. There is no choice in such matters. Mr. blandish, Grissom is not the kind of a guy that you reason with over a couple of whiskey sours at the country club. He's a vicious, murdering psychopath. Either you do what he says or you wind up dead. Then maybe it'd be better if she were dead. She's gonna need help. She'll be in shock. We'll have a doctor standing by. I think that sort of decision should be left to me, Mr. fenner. What are the police doing? They won't get out of this state. It's just a matter of time. Keep me informed. I want to be there when you find her. It looks like he got the message, huh, Sherlock? Yeah. Father of the year, right? How would you like to cry on that shoulder, mclaine? That just might be him, son. You get yourself on that telephone and call the police. Sure thing, pa. You okay? You can lay down on my jacket if you want. You get some sleep now. Okay? Have you thought about where we're going? No. El Paso, maybe. You'll be caught, won't you? Then what happens? They hang you. That don't scare me none. I get caught, I guess you get to go home. I guess so. I ain't foolin' myself. You'll like going home, won't you? I don't know. It's been such a long time. I just don't know. I suppose I'm a little... Scared about what everybody's going to say. Maybe Eddie was right. Maybe my father won't be so happy to see me. You kiddin'? You let that Eddie smart-mouth you with talk like that? Your daddy will be crazy to see you again. Just like I'd be to see my ma. Of course, they still gotta kill me first. I'm not worth dying for. Nobody's worth that. I ain't got you, I don't care what happens. That doesn't make sense. Haven't you ever loved nobody? Not like that. Nobody's ever loved me like that either. They've said it lots of times, but... I guess they just didn't mean it the way you mean it. That makes me better than all them college boys then, huh? Don't get yourself killed. Don't die for me. Please? You'd really care if I died? That's a real nice thing to say. Now, come on. You get some sleep and stop worrying. Don't you worry about me, okay? Come on. You want some more water or anything? Good night. Was inviting the press your bright idea? How often do I get to bust a case like this, fenner? It's a free country, Mr. blandish. How do we know he won't kill her? He's let her live up till now. We gotta figure he'll keep on lettin' her live. Disgusting. Maybe I shouldn't even be here. If she gets outta there, she's gonna need your help. She's sure as hell gonna need somebody's help. This is chief mcllaine. We have the barn completely surrounded. You have no hope of escape. Send the girl out first. Come out with your hands up. You hear that? Send the girl out first, then come out with your hands up. Come on, Grissom, you don't have a chance. Send the girl out first, then come out with your hands... Come on! Come on, where are ya?! Come on, where are ya, you murdering bastards?! Slim, are you all right? That won't do you any good, Grissom. Come on out. Come on, Grissom. You don't have a chance. Send the gin out first, then come out with your hands up. Slim, please! Wait. Please wait. Your time is up, Grissom. Come on outta there. Don't get killed! Please! You're going home. It don't matter now. Please, slim. Get away from him. - What? - Get away from him! Did you hear me? Get away from him! Daddy, please don't be upset. I was only trying to stay alive. Was that worth staying alive for? He wouldn't let me go. He loved me. Can't you understand? No, I can't. And I guess I never will. Mr. fenner here will look after you. Give the girl a break, will you, fellas? How do you feel now that Grissom's dead? - Did they keep you tied up? - Did you try to escape? Mr. blandish, I'm the fella... I was just... About the reward money... You'll get the story later. Get outta my way! Will you get outta my way? Tell him. Come on. Mr. blandish, I'm the fella that tipped off the police. Now, about that reward money... Now speak up. Radio and papers... Wait a minute!
