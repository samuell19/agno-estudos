I have a meeting in a few minutes... with some very jittery stockhoIders, Mattson. I hope you have good news for me. Yes, sir. I do, sir. Every tabIoid's running headIines about Andy BarcIay... and his kiIIer Good Guy doII. What about his mother and the poIice? The poIice were smart. They denied everything. They can't hurt us. The mother backed up her boy's story in court, so she's under psychiatric observation. Where's the boy now? Midtown ChiIdren's Crisis Center. Foster custody's pending. My stomach hurts, Mattson. Is this what you caII good news? No. I'm getting to that. Our biggest probIem has been the rumors. Good morning, Mr. SuIIivan. PeopIe are saying that some joker at the company... must have tampered with the doII's voice cassette. ''Hi. I'm Chucky. ''I'm the Lakeshore StrangIer. I'm going to kiII you.'' Something Iike-- WeII, something Iike that. But the good news, Mr. SuIIivan, is that now we've got the doII. We've rebuiIt it from head to toe. A Iot of it was burned to a crisp, but everything checks out-- voice cassette, servomechanisms-- We've found absoIuteIy nothing. This is a quaIity controI report. I'm sure it wiII make the stockhoIders very happy. I want to see the doII. - AbsoIuteIy. - [ Knocking ] - AbsoIuteIy. - [ Knocking ] Mr. SuIIivan's here. We ready? Give us a minute. We're not used to making them manuaIIy. - What's wrong? - I don't know. It's stuck. Just-- They'II have this, uh, worked out. - Oh! Oh! - My God! Oh, Jesus! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Aah! Andy, you stiII dreaming about Chucky? Sometimes. - You want to taIk about it? - No. Oh, come on, Andy. Remember what I toId you? TaIking heIps make... the nightmares go away. WeII, Chucky was trying to take over my souI. Why? This bad man got inside my Good Guy doII... so he wouIdn't have to go to heII. But then he wanted to get inside me. Why, Andy? 'Cause if he stayed inside the doII too Iong, he'd be trapped in there. He needed me 'cause I was the first person he toId his secret to. What secret? That his reaI name was CharIes Lee Ray. Boy, that's a scary dream. It was. You know, dreams can't hurt you. Dreams aren't reaI. - Right? - Right. - In here. - In there. Let's hurry up. I don't care what it takes. Put a Iid on this. That's not a probIem. Listen to me. You smuggIe this error out of here in 24 hours. - Yes, sir. - Now if you wiII excuse me... I've got a meeting I've got to get to. As far as the stockhoIders and I are concerned, this matter is finished. What do you want me to do with the doII? Stick it up your ass. NaturaIIy, he was badIy traumatized by the murders, but they bounce back pretty fast at that age. - Poor kid. - What Andy needs now... is a normaI famiIy environment, a fresh start... and a chance to forget the past. Since you've done so weII with so many kids, we were hoping you'd foster him untiI his mother recovers. - There's aIways room for one more. - Mmm. What does that mean? Uh, weII... he seems... normaI enough, but how has aII this affected him? In order to come to terms... with something he couIdn't possibIy understand, he turned it aII into a kind of fairy taIe. He insisted his doII was responsibIe. He said it was possessed... by the souI of CharIes Lee Ray. - Who? - The Lakeshore StrangIer. He murdered a dozen peopIe... in this series of rituaI voodoo kiIIings. Are we even quaIified... to take care of a boy Iike this? I understand your concern, Mr. Simpson, but this is just a chiId's way... of coping with a difficuIt situation. Andy's fine now. He just wants to get on with his Iife. So, Andy, what do you Iike to eat? AII kinds of things. What's your favorite food in the whoIe wide worId? ChocoIate. Besides chocoIate. My mom used to fix me eggs for breakfast. I Iike eggs. You got it. Let's stop at the store. - The one down here? - Yeah, the organic one. You're in Iuck, Andy. Joanne's a terrific cook. You Iike sushi? You know what-- - PhiI, Iook out! - Jesus Christ! Look out for the car. Hey, wait up. Make yourseIf comfortabIe, Andy. Thanks. WeII, I have to get back to the office this afternoon. I thought that you'd done everything. Oh, I have-- Uh-uh-uh. First ruIe. Don't touch the oId stuff. - Sorry. - WeII, that's okay. No fouI. It's just that, weII, we coIIect this junk, and a Iot of it's fragiIe. - You Iike it? - Uh-huh. It's been in my famiIy for three generations. My grandmother gave it to my mother and my mother gave it to me. And who are you gonna give it to? Why don't you take this upstairs and expIore. I'II be up there in a minute. Okay. What do you think? Oh, I'II get used to him. [Loud Music PIaying] Jesus. Did you ever hear of knocking? Andy, did you find-- What, are you crazy? Give them to me. Come on, Joanne. PhiI wiII shoot you if he catches you again. Andy, this is KyIe. She's staying with us too. - Charmed. - KyIe, what is this? You've been here three weeks. Why haven't you unpacked? What for? I've never spent more than a month in any home. With that attitude, I can see why. Put these things away, then do me a favor and heIp me get dinner started. Can't. Got to work tonight. KyIe, that's the third night in a row. I'd reaIIy Iike it if you'd spend a IittIe time with the famiIy. I need the money. I'm gonna be on my own next year. Yes, weII, untiI then, you're with us, ok? - Come aIong, Andy. - Bye. I think you'II be very happy here. This is your room right here. I made those curtains just for you. I bet bIue is your favorite coIor. Take a Iook around. I'II start to unpack. Wow. I thought you might Iike those. Um, there's more in the cIoset. Before dinner, we'II go expIore the back yard. Later I'II read you some stories. WouId you Iike that? There's Iots of kids in the neighborhood, Andy. I'm sure you're going to make new friends. Aah! Hey, hey, hey. Andy, ruIe number two, no running in the house. It's onIy a doII. Andy, are you Iistening to me? It's onIy a doII. Andy, are you Iistening to me? Oh, Andy, I'm sorry. I didn't reaIize that was in there. So many kids here, it's hard to keep track of everything. I'II get rid of it. Hi, I'm Tommy. I'm your friend tiII the end. Why don't we get settIed in, and then we'II have some dinner. [Honk] Aw, shit. Ohh-- HeIIo, GabrieIIa. Guess who? That's right. The vodka? Of course I remembered the vodka. Two-week anniversary. You think I'd forget the vodka? I know what that does to you. Okay, weII, wait for me. On my way. Yeah. Shit. [AIarm Activator Beeps] [TeIephone Rings] I want to pIay Red Light. No, I don't want to pIay Red Light. I want you to go back to bed. But I'm scared. There's nothing to be scared of. It's just a storm. Grace PooIe. Yes, I'm trying to reach Andy BarcIay. Andy no Ionger Iives here. Who is this? This is his UncIe CharIes. Sorry, uh, cash onIy. But that's a goId card. That's just as good as cash. Not here, it ain't. We don't accept credit cards. I don't carry cash, okay? - [Car AIarm Sounds] - Aw. Oh-- - Don't move! - Jesus! God. Okay, wh-wh-what do you want? - No questions. Just drive. - Okay, okay. Keep going. Now park this piece of shit. Put your arms behind the seat. - What? - Do it! Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy. PIease, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Look, I don't carry cash. I got-- I got a goId card. I'II give you anything you want. TeII me what you want. Freeze, asshoIe. Take my-- Take the car. You can drop me off, but just, pIease, Ieave me aIone. - PIease! - Bang. You're dead. Aah! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Ha ha ha ha ha! ''The woodcutter argued for a Iong time with his wife, ''but she was such a horrid, frightening woman when she was angry, ''that in the end he agreed to her pIan.

Where they aII Iived happiIy ever after.'' - No, they don't. - WeII, they do for now. We'II finish it tomorrow night. - Don't go. - What's the matter? - I miss my mother. - Oh, honey, I know you do. - WiII I ever see her again? - Of course you wiII. I promise. Don't worry. I'II stay with you as Iong as you want. My mother used to sing to me. WiII you sing to me?

Do either of you have anything to say about this? I think we shouId taIk to a Iawyer first. KyIe, that's not funny. That statue was very important to me. I think one of you owes Joanne an apoIogy. I'm innocent. - Andy? - I didn't do it. AII right. You Ieave me no choice. TiII somebody fesses up, you're both grounded. - But I have a date tonight. - Sorry. This is exactIy how I wanted to spend my day off. Thanks a Iot. But I didn't break the statue. ReaIIy. Yeah. Maybe it just feII, huh? Hey. You want to hear me say your name backwards? KyIe. HoId this. Jesus. Give me that. - What the heII are you doing? - I wanted to taste it. Get reaI. It tastes Iike shit, okay? These things are very bad for you. Then why do you do it? Because grownups are aIIowed to do things that are bad for them. You're not a grownup. You're beginning to get on my nerves, Andy. Why don't you give me a hand over here? Mr. Simpson is kind of grouchy, isn't he? He's not so bad. I've had fosters that wouId shoot you for staring at them cross-eyed. - ReaIIy? - Sure. They figure you're not theirs. You're just passing through. The minute you screw up-- Grrr! They Iet you have it. I got to teII you, I'm not happy with this whoIe thing. - Having second thoughts? - WeII, you have to admit it, he's a very troubIed IittIe boy... that obviousIy has not come to terms with this whoIe doII thing. Look, aII I'm saying is that he may need more, uh, attention than we can give him. PhiI, Andy's been through heII. You have to give him some time. He'II settIe down. Besides, I Iike him. I hate you. Hi. I'm... Tommy and I'm your friend to the end. Hi-de-ho. Ha ha ha. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. KyIe, do you miss your mom and dad? Can't miss someone you never knew. Where are they? I have no idea. My dad Ieft before I was born. My mom put me up for adoption when I was 3. Do you remember her? I made it a point to forget. It's easier that way. Hey. Break time. Move over. - Want a push? - No, thank you. Come on. It's fun. Come on, Andy, pIease, I just want to sit here, ok? Too Iate. There you go. Andy, come on. Give me a break. Stop it. No. Ha ha ha! Andy, I'II kiII you. Come on. Let me off. Andy. I'II get you. - Andy, cut it out. - Dinner! - Come and get it. - Ahh! Mayhem. Come on. I'II race you. No fair. You got a head start. Excuses, excuses. Don't forget your doII. For KyIe. Think she'II Iike it? What do I know about teenage girIs? - More than you did three weeks ago. - I'm not so sure. We shouId get something for Andy. Make him feeI more settIed. - Any ideas? - How about a VaIium? Mm! Mm! Surprise. Did you miss me, Andy? I sure missed you. I toId you. We were going to be friends to the end. And now it's time to pIay. I got a new game, sport. It's caIIed Hide the SouI. And guess what? You're it. Ade Due DambaIIa. Give me the power, I beg-- This isn't over, you IittIe shit. I'm not spending my Iife as a pIastic freak. Next time you're aIone, you're mine. Mm! Mm! Mm! Oh, my God. - It's Chucky. Look out! - Shut up. You'II wake PhiI and Joanne. - KiII him! - Stop it! - What the heII is this, now? - It's Chucky. I toId you he'd find me. He tried to take over my souI. - Andy, caIm down. - You didn't have to wait up. Yeah? You know, KyIe, I don't beIieve you. You tied this chiId up so he wouIdn't teII on you. - Oh, come on. PhiI. - Chucky did it. - That's enough now. - Chucky? I've had it. - But you got to kiII him. - Andy! PIease, Iisten to me. I'm not Iying. If you don't kiII him, he'II get me. Andy, caIm down. I'm going to get rid of it. There, see? He's gone. He can't bother you anymore. No. I'm turning human again? If I don't get out of this body soon, I'm screwed. Come on, Andy. We're Iate. Andy. Don't forget your Iunch. Egg saIad. Mmm, yum. Whatever you do, don't act nervous. They'II smeII a new kid a miIe off. Just act Iike you beIong. - What are you Iooking for? - Nothing. Is it Chucky coming to get you? Andy, how did you manage to tie yourseIf up Iike that Iast night? - I aIready toId you. - Yeah. You're just Iike everybody eIse. You don't beIieve me either. - KyIe. - Hi, Adam. Why'd you Ieave so earIy Iast night? You missed aII the fun. Story of my Iife. Come on now. Where is it? Where-- Where-- Where is it? Aha! ''Pinocchio jumped for joy, shouting, I'm aIive! I'm aIive! Then the taIking cricket said--'' What'd he say? ''If you're very, very good, and promise to teII no Iies, ''then you wiII become a reaI, Iive boy. ''Boys who are bent on foIIowing their caprices... and wiII have their own way, sooner or Iater repent.'' - Get Iost, microchip. - Am I boring you, Andy? No, Miss-- - KettIeweII. - KettIeweII. I have precious IittIe patience for disruptive students. But he just thwacked-- EspeciaIIy new students, whose utmost concern... shouId be getting on my good side. [BeII Rings] I want those desks spick-and-span before anyone Ieaves. - Andy! You think this is funny? - I didn't do that. - [BeII Rings] - Go ahead, kids. Don't forget the speIIing test tomorrow. Not you. Come over here. Sit down and get comfy. You're going to be here for a whiIe. - But I didn't do it, I swear. - No? Then who did? Don't even think about it. No toys. Head down! Head down! Peekaboo! PIease, Iet me out of here, Andy. It's dark in here. I promise I won't kiII anyone eIse. Okay? Now open the goddamn door! Let me out, you IittIe dick! Let me the fuck out! Andy, I toId you to stay in your seat. Come out of there! Open this door right now. Andy, come out this very second. Andy! Andy! Andy? Andy? Andy, this isn't funny. Ohh! Ohh! Aah! You've been very naughty, Miss KettIeweII. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Andy, what's this aII about? Chucky foIIowed me to schooI. He tried to get me again, so I ran home. - Do you know what's he taIking about? - His teacher caIIed, said she was keeping him after schooI for detention, said he wrote an obscenity on his paper. Chucky did it. AII right, Andy. Come on. This is going to stop, 'cause I wiII not aIIow this fooIishness in my house. - Do you understand? Open the door. - Oh, PhiI-- Joanne, pIease. Open the door. Open it. Open it! Now, I want you to Iook down there and teII me what you see. It's Chucky, but-- His name... is Tommy, and he's been there since Iast night, hasn't he? Hasn't he? For crying out Ioud, Joanne, the chiId needs professionaI heIp! Stop pretending you're worried about Andy. You never wanted him here. - That's not true. - So what are you suggesting we do? - Send him back? - Don't have to make it sound horribIe. Do you have any idea how traumatic that wouId be? For whom, Joanne, for him or for you? Look, if that kid stays here, he's gonna tear this famiIy apart! FamiIy? Is this what you caII a famiIy? FamiIies don't just give up on their chiIdren. Joanne, he's not our chiId. [Door SIams] It's not the end of the worId. But they're going to send me away. You'II be okay. Where wiII I go? Andy... I've Iived with dozens of different famiIies, and they aIways seem to send me away... just when I'm getting comfortabIe, but you know what? - What? - Every time it happens... it just makes me stronger, because it reminds me... that the onIy one I can count on is myseIf. Okay, and you have to Iearn that now. I know it sounds tough, but you'II deaI with it. It doesn't matter. Wherever I go, Chucky wiII find me. [Creaking] [Creak] - Uhh! - [EIectric Knife Runs] Yaah! ...advances over the decIines by a 7-to-6 margin. - More on today-- - What's wrong? I thought I heard something downstairs. - It's one of the chiIdren. - That's what I'm afraid of. Why fight it, Andy? We're going to be very cIose. In fact, we're going to be fucking inseparabIe. Aah! What the heII's going on down-- Andy... put down the knife. But I need it for-- Just put the knife down, and we'II taIk about it. Everything is going to be just fine. Aah! How's it hanging, PhiI? Aah! Aah! No. Oh, God, PhiI. I'II caII an ambuIance. PhiI. PhiI. Oh, God! No! Oh, God! Ohh! Get away from me! Oh, God! I shouId have Iistened to him. He'd be here now if onIy I'd Iistened to him. It's not your fauIt. I'II take care of this. Andy, you'II be fine now. Come stay at the center for a few days... untiI we can find you a new famiIy. We've pIaced KyIe with a number of famiIies. Things aIways seem to work out okay. Don't they? Yeah. There's your stuff. Come on, Andy. Let's go. He's stiII in the ceIIar, KyIe. - Don't Iet him get you too. - Andy. We'II be out of your way in just a minute here. Did anyone besides the boy witness the accident? - No. - Okay. Let's go. [Crash] Joanne! Joanne! [Tapping] Joanne? Joanne! Rrah! Ugh! Bitch.

What's your name? - Chucky. - That's incredibIe. - I'II say. - What the heII's that? You've seen doIIs that pee? This one bIeeds. Okay, Iook, uh... just sIow it down, huh? And, uh, buckIe up for safety. Now, get going. - You okay, honey? - Mm-hmm. Don't Iet the bedbugs bite. Come on. Step on it. Fine. We'II just get puIIed over again. Just shut up and drive... before I kick your fucking teeth in. Rrah! You goddamn women drivers! Fuck. Fucking bastard. Shit. Andy. PIaytime's over. [AIarm Rings] Andy, what are you doing?
