Wait for me here. - Yes, Monsieur. I am the British Consul. Dr Rameau is expecting me. Certainement, Monsieur Le Consul. Entrez, si vous s'il vous plaît. Bonsoir, Monsieur Le Consul. Very kind of you to come here. Put it over the chair. Please step inside. - Thank you. Do you always lock your doors here? A very necessary precaution unfortunately. Sit down. - Thank you. Surprised that I asked you to come here, Monsieur Le Consul? Well, you know my job leads me into some odd places. But I must admit. This is the first visit I've ever made to an institution of this kind. You should come to see us more often. Very instructive. But now, about this patient of yours. You want me to identify him, I understand? Yes. We have every reason to believe that he is English. What exactly is the matter with him? He had tried to commit suicide. But when we asked him why he wished to destroy himself .. He merely laughed and said .. "I want you to know what people would say about me." "After I am dead." When did this happen? It was at the time of the last full moon. Nervous cases are apt to be influenced by the moon. Hello? Bring up the patient in Room 12. To you, as a layman. He will appear to be .. A normal. Charming, highly intelligent young man. But if you watch him closely. You will notice a certain curious lack of emotion. A certain tonelessness in his speech. To the expert, these indications confirm .. That he is suffering from what we call "paranoia". But surely there is some cure? Very rarely. In this case, I am afraid not. Outwardly, he might remain calm and apparently sane for long periods. But if anything happens to upset him emotionally. Love. Jealousy. Or any kind of opposition. He may become very dangerous indeed. Capable of anything. Even murder. [ Door knocks ] Entre. Mr Andrews is outside, Monsieur Le Directeur. Andrews. Andrews? That is a very common name in our country. I am afraid it will be difficult to identify him. The name is all he will tell us. Sometimes he talks vaguely about the death of his father. It seems to obsess him. But about his family or friends, not one word. We are hoping you can arrange for him to be sent to some institution in England. Well, I suppose we had better see him. Fetch him in. Pas ici, il a disparu. Quoi? But that is impossible. Hey! He must be hiding somewhere .. - Monsieur Le Directeur. Did you see the patient leave this room? Speak up, man. What are you staring at? Monsieur Le Consul is still here? I thought I unlocked the door for him a moment ago. He went out to take a taxi. He has taken my hat and coat. Call the police. He certainly is a clever fellow. What did you say his name was? - His name was .. What was his name, Dr Boudin? - Andrews. Ward Andrews. That is right. Ward Andrews. Paging Mr Andrews. Mr Ward Andrews. Paging Mr Andrews. Ward Andrews. Paging Mr Andrews. Ward Andrews. Paging Mr Andrews. Mr Ward Andrews. Paging Mr Andrews. - Here, boy. Mr Ward Andrews? Yes, that is me. - Here you are, sir. Thank you, sir. Is she blond our brunette? Phillip. What on earth are you doing in London? I thought you were in the wilds of Africa. The last time I heard of you, you were designing turbines in Scotland. When I heard them calling your name I couldn't have been more surprised. The boss just sent for me to return now. I have been having a holiday in France. You have? Well, I just got back from Paris myself. Mother called her little boy home. Look, Phillip. I still have 48 hours. Can't we spend them together somewhere? To be sure we can. You're coming right back to Chassingford with me now. Chassingford? - You don't know how I missed you. It's going to be just like old times. The place looks exactly the same. Yes, yes. Mother hates anything new. New furniture. New carpets. New faces. Who is this? I never saw her before in my life. How do you do. My name is Stella Bergen. I am Mrs Monrell's secretary and companion. Mrs Monrell asked me to welcome her son. But .. You don't know which is which? No. I am afraid you will just have to guess. Very well. Which of you suggested taking the morning train? I did. Then you are Phillip Monrell. - Why do you say that? Mrs Monrell told me that Mr Phillip never gets up before one o'clock. That's a fine sort of mother. Blackening her son's reputation in advance. What she doesn't know is that I sleep better on trains than anywhere else. That is one thing I've learned in all my travels. Oh, then you are .. - Right. Are you disappointed? Not at all. Welcome home, Mr Monrell. Phillip is the name. - Ahem. Yes. I beg your pardon. May I present the best engineer in England. Mr Ward Andrews. The man who made it possible for me to stand four boring years at Cambridge. He's so brilliant he even got me through the exams. How do you do. Thanks for introducing me, old man. - Not at all. Do you like him? Stop it, Phillip. Give her a chance. She's known me just 2 minutes. You're too modest, Ward. A single heartbeat would have been sufficient wouldn't it, Stella? I see you are both crazy. And very conceited. Your mother is upstairs. She'll be ready to see you in a moment. If you wait here I will call you. Oh, Clark. How long has Miss Bergen been here? Mrs Monrell arranged for her to come over 3 months ago from the continent. Her parents were killed. It's a very sad story. She is a refugee. Phillip. You can come up now. Come along, Ward. If you want me I'm in the sitting-room. - No, no, no. You stay here. Hide that medicine bottle quick. Hello. Hello, darling. Phillip. Prodigal son. What are you doing up here? Have you been ill? Of course not. I overslept. Did you get my letter from St Tropez? Yes. And I don't believe a word of it. Studying painting indeed. Paint must be very expensive in France. At any rate, I rented the largest studio in the place. Phillip, you and I have got to have a long and serious talk. Yes. Yes, I know. The Steelworks. I knew I'd have to face that this time. So I brought a friend along to bolster up my courage. Your beloved Ward Andrews I suppose? - I bumped into him in London. Aren't you pleased? Why, of course. But Stella and I were hoping to have you all to ourselves. Weren't we, Stella? It's no good appealing to Stella. She is on his side already. Ward. You can come in now. The battle is over or at least postponed. I hope you won't mind my intruding, Mrs Monrell. Why, no. Not at all, Ward. You're quite a stranger. I asked him to stay tonight. I thought he needed a breath of country air. We shall be delighted of course. Show him to his old room. We'll all meet at lunch. Thank you, Mrs Monrell. Stella. How do you like him? I like him very much. I think he is very charming. Very amusing. Hey, don't you want to stop? Alright. I had a hard job keeping up with you. I am sorry. I forgot. You mean you forgot that I was there at all? Not only you. Everything and everybody. When you gallop like that. You seem to leave all your troubles behind you. There are no troubles today. You cannot really escape from them. You had a bad time before you came to England, didn't you? I promised Mrs Monrell I'd forget it. She has been wonderful to me. Just like my own mother. Then you are happy here? I would be most ungrateful if I wasn't. Everybody is so kind. That is not very difficult, you know. Phillip says that you have to be in Scotland tomorrow. He's very sad you are leaving. You are his hero. He only admires me because we are so different. You see, we have known each other ever since we were boys. This place has been a sort of second home to me. And now that you are here it is perfect. Perhaps I shan't stay here much longer. Why not? - Oh. I can't live on Mrs Monrell's charity indefinitely. My life is .. Is like this clearing. Nice and peaceful. Paths leading in all directions. Only I don't know which one to take. Stella. I would like to help you find the right tone. Doesn't it make you thirsty just to look at it? Hey, that is not the way to drink. You are spilling it. Hold your hands like this. Like this? - No. Like this. Overlap them. That's right. Oh. Most of it went down my sweater. How quiet it is. Yes. Isn't it. I think we had better be going. But Stella .. - We must go, Ward. Do we really have to? - I can't monopolise you. After all, you are Phillip's guest. He is probably still asleep. - Then it's high time he woke up. Don't fidget, mother. They'll be back soon. They ought to be back now. It's lunchtime. You are so unromantic, mother. If I were alone in a wood with a charming protégée such as yours .. I could starve to death and never notice it. Then why aren't you? There were too many hedges in between. I didn't ask you. How do you like Stella? Why didn't you write me about her? Didn't I? I must have forgotten. Come now, mother. You never forget anything. She's a very remarkable girl, don't you think? Ward seems to share your opinion. Under the circumstances wasn't it rather silly asking him down here at all? What difference does it make? The world is full of Wards. She was bound to meet one sooner or later. When you talk like that I could box your ears. You know that you are much more attractive than Ward. Thank you, mother darling. But that is not the point. Shall I tell you a secret? In order to love someone you must be a little bit afraid of them. People are afraid of Ward. Nobody is afraid of me. Oh, I am sorry. Are we late for lunch? Not at all, dear. You had a nice time? - Yes. It was wonderful. Look .. look what Ward found. The poor little thing. It was lost in the woods. Ward gave it to me as a present. - He's pretty isn't he. We can keep it, can't we? - Of course, dear. You know, I have a wonderful plan. There is a full moon tonight. You should take Stella down to the old watermill and let her see the fish jump. It is a most romantic spot. There is nothing I would like more but .. I am afraid I will have to leave this afternoon. Come now. What is a day more or less in an engineer's life? You shouldn't try to lure Ward away from his duties. Don't you agree with me, Stella? Yes, Mrs Monrell. It has been a wonderful day for me. It has for us too, hasn't it Stella. Yes. Goodbye, Ward. - Goodbye, Stella. Goodbye, Phillip. - Goodbye, Ward. Isn't he a wonderful fellow? - He is, he is. That is the first time in my life I haven't been sorry to see him leave. Is it? Why? Now I can have you all to myself. Is that so important? - It is to me. I must say, I would never have guessed it. What do you mean? Ever since you arrived you have done your best to get rid of me. By sending me off with Ward. I just wanted to keep you amused. And now that he is gone I will take on the job myself. Well, how are you going to amuse me? I have drawn up an entire program. At nine in the morning I will go out in the garden and pick you some flowers. All wet with the morning dew. I didn't know you walked in your sleep. Well, we'll postpone it until eleven. Flowers are more beautiful then anyway. The sun will have opened them up. Can I get anything for you, Mrs Monrell? No, don't pay any attention to me. I love to hear you play. When you have a moment I must talk to you. Excuse me. I've forgotten the laundry list. I will be back in a moment. - She thinks of everything, doesn't she. I don't know how I got along with her all these years. You always wanted a daughter didn't you, mother. Only don't expect me to have brotherly feelings towards her. Phillip, there's something I must tell you. Something you won't like. You know, I haven't been well lately. But mother, yesterday .. - I know, darling. I didn't want to spoil your homecoming. Dr McTernan advises me to go abroad for a year or two. So serious? No, it is just for the climate. He suggests South Africa. Well, maybe we'll find a diamond mine. I am sorry, darling. You are not coming with me. Not going with you? Why? Because you are going to be too busy managing the steelworks. Oh, mother. Now Phillip, this is for your own good. Since your father died I shouldered the responsibility. Now you'll take it over. [ Piano music ] Is Stella going with you? That depends. Depends on what? Upon her own choice. Don't you think she's too young and beautiful to waste her time .. Nursing an old woman? Perhaps someone else will need her more than I do. Stella. Good evening. Where are you? What on earth are you doing up there? Spying on you all. I saw you yesterday admiring yourself in the greenhouse window .. When you thought no-one was looking. Oh, that is a big fib. I wasn't. And why shouldn't you? You are the nicest part of the view around here anyway. You know. You'd better be careful. I see everything. When I was a boy. I used to sit up here for hours. I used to imagine myself as part of the tree. Phillip. Human branch. Mother and all the servants rushing around below looking for me. Yet here I was enthroned high about all the confusion. You must have been a little horror. Well, I haven't changed very much. My trousers have grown a little longer. That's all. That's better. You're smiling. When you came out of the house just now you looked so thoughtful. Did I? Were you thinking of him? Who? Ward. No, silly. The moon made me sentimental. You call that thing sentimental? A horrible eye staring at us. Don't you like the moonlight? I hate it .. I'm afraid of it. What is there to be afraid of? No. No. You wouldn't. You're like Ward. Tell me, Stella. Do you think I am attractive? What a question. I just wanted to know. Well, I refuse to flatter you. Mother says that I am more attractive that Ward. That settles it. You mother is always right. - Oh yes, indeed. She is. Life is very simple when you listen to mother. All you have to do is exactly what she says. Now she has got it into her head that I can manage the steelworks. Well? You know that is perfectly ridiculous. But Phillip, of course you can. Once you make up your mind to do it. It ought to be easy for you. You are so intelligent. You must get the silly ideas out of your head, always saying that you are afraid. Now listen. Next week you are going down to the foundry. And you are going to take over the business and make us all proud of you. People will look up to you and admire you and .. You will be so happy. So you .. you talk as though you really believed in me. But I do, Phillip. I do. There is no reason why you shouldn't succeed. There's no difference between you and .. And Ward. Why must you always drag Ward into everything? Well, alright then. Ward. Shall I tell you a secret? When I was in Paris on my way back here. I became so worried over what was ahead of me that .. I made myself quite ill. I felt I couldn't face it and I would have to .. Escape or disappear or something. Then I hit on a brilliant idea. What was that? I decided to call myself. Ward Andrews. I know that sounds silly but the name worked like a charm. Suddenly I wasn't afraid anymore. I felt that I could do almost anything that I wanted to do. It was very funny when people came to me and said: "Good morning, Mr Andrews. How are you, Mr Andrews?" "I say Mr Andrews, you are looking better". I think that Phillip Monrell sounds just as nice. You are very sweet to me, Stella. But there is a difference. If ward were here now. Loving you as much as I do. He wouldn't be telling you amusing stories. He would take you in his arms. He would kiss you and he'd ask you to marry him. What would your answer be, Stella? I would say "yes". If you want me, Phillip. I can't believe it. Do you really love me, Phillip? Do I love you? I could die for you. That won't be necessary. I believe I could even kill for you. Anything for Maud? - No. No. But here is another letter from mother. She's arriving in Cape Town. She says .. She feels tired but the doctors are quite satisfied with her. I must write to her this morning. And what are you going to tell her? I will tell her that after six weeks of married life we are sick of each other. And of course you neglect me and spend all your time at the office. Oh, come now. I've been there twice already. You promised me to be there every day. Alright. I see you want to get me out of the house. Be careful. You will hurt him. I wouldn't hurt Ward's cat. Goodness, you are late already. Oh. I will tell Eric to bring the car. "Good morning, Mr Monrell." Get me Mrs Monrell at my home, will you. "Yes, sir." Yes? - "Your wife, Mr Monrell." Thank you. Hello darling. What are you doing? I am quite upset dear. I cannot find the kitten. Well, that is terrible. Well. Never mind. He'll turn up alright. Yes. I know how much you love him. He .. he has never run away before. Well, perhaps he is down in the cellar somewhere. Are you busy now? Yes. Yes, I am in conference. When are you coming to fetch me? Alright. I say, Stella. You couldn't make it 3:30 could you? Thanks .. splendid. When Mrs Monrell comes, will you show her right in please. Ask Mr Higgins, Mr Ramsbottom, Mr Bosley and Mr Black to come in to my office. Good afternoon, Mr Phillip. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Will you have a cigar, Mr Bosley? - Thank you, Mr Monrell. But as you know, indulgence in nicotine is against my principles. I'm sorry, my mistake. You, Mr Higgins? It looks like we'll have to take the will for the deed. Well, accidents will happen. Eh, Mr Phillip? Won't you gentlemen sit down. I am sorry. I will wait outside. - No, darling. Come in. Good afternoon, Mrs Monrell. - Good afternoon, madam. Mr Higgins. - Sit here. I want to speak to you about this report that you brought me. On the whole I am satisfied, but .. I still think our expenses are too high. If you can suggest any further economies you are a better man than I am. Mr Higgins, I don't think you would have talked to my father like that. Here, for instance. What about these? Structural improvements. Which item? What? Item A. Why Mr Phillip, you wouldn't be grudging yourself this fine new office? If that's what it is why doesn't it say so? Item F. 20,000 pounds. That must be cancelled. But Mr Monrell, that is the housing project. Hold on a minute. Those cottages down by Paley Brook are no better than a few stinking rat-holes. If you pardon the expression, Mrs Monrell. We can't expect our operatives to live in such places nowadays. I wouldn't kennel my dog in them. You have no right to make such decisions behind my back. Mr Monrell. I've been the Chief Engineer of this company for 30 years. And you knew my father and you know every inch of the works. And you held my hand when I was a little tot. Yes. I know the whole sermon backwards. You are still treating me as if I was a child. I am your employer now. You'll have to obey me I am afraid. Is that clear? Perfectly clear. And I must ask you to accept my resignation. Please, Mr Black. Can't we discuss this another time? I'm sure my husband .. Your resignation is accepted as of today. Anything else, gentlemen? You are the boss here, Mr Monrell. You are entitled to have your own way. Don't say we didn't warn you. Excuse me, madam. The kitten. Did you find him? - Yes, madam. Where is he? The chauffeur found him, madam. I think you had better speak to him yourself. Is he hurt? I am very sorry this should have happened, Mrs Monrell. What do you mean? What has happened? The poor little blighter. A dog must have been at it. His neck was broke. Oh. But where did you find him? He was lying in Platt's Lane just behind the steelworks. We can't understand how he got there. Perhaps he followed you to the office, sir. Don't be ridiculous. If he'd been in the car you'd have seen him, wouldn't you. Yes, sir. I only thought .. I don't pay you to think. Mind your own business and get out of here. You too, Clark. Get out. Darling, I asked them to look for it. It isn't their fault. It's not their fault? It's my fault I suppose. Is that what you mean? Why are you all staring at me? Leave me alone. Get out of here. Please, Phillip. Nobody is accusing you of anything. They are all against me. Those fools at the office: Clark, the chauffeur. And you too. Yes you. Get out. Leave me alone. Forgive me. I .. I don't know what came over me. You are upset. That is all. You see, darling. You mustn't leave me. Not even for a second. I need you with me all the time. The day has been too much. First I make decisions and everyone turns against me. Now this man talks as if I had something to do with that horrible accident. You mustn't imagine things like that. We should be sad about it. I'll buy you a hundred kittens. I don't think I ever want another. This one meant so much to me. Because Ward gave it to you? Stella, why did you ever marry me? But I love you. Hasn't the time we've been together convinced you of that? But it's been just the two of us. We've been alone. There has been nobody else. Suppose somebody else. Supposing .. Ward. Ward, Ward, Ward. Always Ward! If you can't rid yourself of that idea you will .. I'll go mad. Is that what you were going to say? Very well. I will tell you something. When I first met Ward I thought he was charming. Perhaps he was interested in me. I don't know. But I married you, didn't I? So he was interested in you? I knew it all along. Phillip, I love you. Really I do. Promise me one thing. Don't ever mention Ward's name again. I promise. Say once more that you love me. I love you. And I love you. You don't know how much. Hello, Clark. Good to see you again. - Thank you, sir. Hello. I am glad to see you. Hello, Phillip. She has no idea who it is. I am dying to see her face when she recognises you. So you never told her I was invited? - No. That would have spoiled the fun. It's nice to have you here again. It's just like old times. With one important difference. I am still a poor lonely old bachelor and you are a happily married man. However did you get her? By a superb piece of acting. I pretended I was you. Now I understand everything. Hello, Mrs Monrell. This time you won't have to guess which one of us is master of the house. How do you do, Mr Andrews. How do you do. Aren't you pleased with my surprise, Stella? Of course I am. Why the formality? Surely you haven't forgotten one another's Christian names? I haven't. Certainly. Neither has she. I never gave her a chance to. Have I, Stella? No. Phillip reminded me of you from time to time. Dinner is ready, madam. Very well, Clark. Come on, Phillip. Do you think Phillip has changed much? - Enormously. I noticed it the moment I saw him. He is positively sleek with happiness. Well here we are, all reunited again. I think this calls for a celebration. How about a bottle of Château Le ..? I'll ring Clark. He'll get it. Clark doesn't know where I keep the best stuff. Or is it dangerous to leave you two people alone? Huh? Oh, very. I will risk it. Stella. I want to tell you how very glad I am to see you and Phillip so happy. I hope you didn't mind his little surprise. Certainly not. But I haven't entirely forgiven you for not coming to our wedding. You know I would have done anything in the world to be there. But I work for a Scotchman. I doubt he'd give me a day off for my own funeral. I haven't had a moment to myself since the weekend I came here with Phillip. Do you remember? - That is ages ago. That day in the woods you said you didn't know which path to take. I took the right tone. I think so too, Stella. And I wish you all the happiness in the world. Did I miss something good? - Ward is telling me about his work. Do you like your work? Now and then I wish I had more time to myself to experiment and so forth. But I love it. Suppose you were offered a better job. With three times as much pay. Shorter hours. A house to yourself. And frequent invitations to dinner at the Monrells. What would you say? I just roll over in bed and say let me dream a little longer. No. I am serious about it. Our chief engineer left us last week and I am offering you the position. I don't know what to say, Phillip. It's a marvellous chance. Much better than I ever deserved. You'd like it too, wouldn't you, Stella? Yes. Yes. Of course I would. Alright then, I accept. Why, it is .. It is just like drawing a winner in the Irish Sweep. Thanks awfully, old man. Silence. Mr Monrell has the floor. May we all be together ten years from tonight. Just as we are now. Stella. Ward. To the three of us. You are reading that book upside down. Have you got eyes in the back of your head? I always know what you are doing. And what you are thinking too. Why didn't you tell me that Ward was coming? Because I promised never to mention his name. We have been very happy alone, haven't we. Can't we go on like this? But you always told me you thought Ward was so charming. I thought you would be glad to have him with us. Alright. If you insist. Goodnight, Phillip. I am very tired. Goodnight. He seemed very pleased top see us, didn't he. Darling I am very sleepy. We'll talk about him tomorrow as much as we want. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'll be back soon. A week at the outside. It seems an awfully long time. First, she wants me to be a businessman. Then she's surprised I have to go on business trips. Take good care of her, Ward. Don't worry. I won't let her out of my sight. Goodbye, darling. Send me a wire when you know which day you are coming back. I'll give you plenty of warning. I can't understand what made him decide to leave so suddenly. Well, I must get back home. We're having a big housecleaning. Stella, there is something I must talk to you about. Is it very important? - It's about Phillip. Until the other day I had no idea why Mr Black left. Ward, I don't understand it. Why don't you speak to Phillip himself? I've tried to often enough but he is so obstinate. I can't understand him any longer. He seems to have changed since .. Since I married him, you mean? - Don't be ridiculous. It is just that .. Well, I don't want to discuss Phillip behind his back. I'm not talking behind his back. I've told him to his face but he won't listen. I'm sure he knows what he is doing. I doubt it. - I can't help that. And you certainly don't help him by agreeing with him. He is in for trouble. And you've got to make him see reason. It is your duty. I know my duty Ward without you telling me. I hope so. You're very sure of yourself, aren't you. Mr Andrews is down at the machine shop, Mrs Monrell. Shall I call him? - No. I will wait. If you take two men and work a few hours overtime I think you can finish tonight. Well, Mr Andrews, we'll try but I can't promise any miracles. Stella. I know I shouldn't have come here, but .. But I had to see you. - I'll be with you in a minute. Take the blueprint. If there's anything you don't understand call me at home. Yes, Mr Andrews. If your wife asks you why you are so late I will back your alibi. She has learned better than to ask, sir. I'm afraid I can't shake hands. Will you excuse me a minute. I want to apologise for the way I behaved yesterday. I couldn't sleep all night thinking about what you said about Phillip. Phillip is handling the men the wrong way. He thinks he can dictate to them but they won't stand for it. There's a lot of things you don't know. Stella, please tell me. Is there anything wrong between you and Phillip? Why do you ask that? Yesterday you behaved so strangely. As if you were trying to hide something about him. I don't know, Ward. Phillip has been so miserable lately. I keep wondering if it isn't I who make him so unhappy. You couldn't make anyone unhappy even if you tried. Phillip adores you. When we are together he talks of no-one but you. I am trying so hard to be a good wife to him. Sometimes I have the feeling that he wants to kill my love. Stella, I know Phillip. He is terribly difficult at times. He needs affection more than anyone else I've ever met. And you are giving it to him. You are the best wife any man could wish for. You make me feel so ashamed of myself. What a good friend you are. To both of us. Come on. Let's see a smile. That's better. I'm not going to let you go back to that house and spend the whole evening alone. I'll tell you what. You need a good dinner and some of my witty conversation. How about it? I don't know. Phillip doesn't like me to go out. Nonsense. He told me to look after you, didn't he? You wouldn't want me to disobey my employer. Do you know .. This is the first time I have been out in the evening since I married. It is such fun to be among people. You would get pretty sick of them if you came here night after night. Right now, I can tell exactly what each one of these people is talking about. What do you talk about? - I am the biggest bore of the lot. I don't believe you. - Very well. You want to hear the subject of my secret dreams? That sounds very interesting. - It is. I am trying to invent a new type of annular bearing. Now, naturally .. My problem is to meet the peak torque loads .. And at the same time resist the molecular disintegration. Now, the carbonizing compound and the precise critical temperature .. Stop it. You win. Well, you asked for it. Hello there. - Hello, Phillip. Are you back already? Yes. Obviously. Why didn't you wire me? I would have met your train. I am afraid I forgot to. You see, I finished my business in London sooner than I expected. When I came home and saw you weren't there .. I guessed you were with Ward and I knew he dined here often. Clever of me, wasn't it. We have been talking about you, darling. What a depressing subject. Couldn't you think of something more romantic? Look here, Phillip. It is about the housing project. I know how difficult it is for a man in your position to reverse a decision. It takes courage. But if you do it. Nobody will you think you are giving way out of weakness. I agree with Ward. I am sure you do. The men will respect you for it. We all would. And as it happens, I don't want respect. I want obedience. Obedience. Do you understand? I don't think we had better discuss this anymore. I might get angrier. Hmm. Very well. Waiter. Don't bother about the bill, Ward. Paying bills is a husband's privilege. Perhaps his only privilege. Look here, Phillip. If you think .. - Ward, let's go. Excuse me. I will be with you in just a moment. Put Mr Andrews dinner on my bill. How much do I owe you? You're leaving us already, Mr Monrell? Let us see now. You have only been with us one night. That will be room, breakfast and the dinner. That will be .. 21 shillings if you please, sir. Tell the men to get off that courtyard and send them home as quick as you can. Mr Monrell has telephoned for the police. Police have never been inside the workshop. There will be broken heads. - That is why I tell you. Get them out of here quick. - Come on, boys. Let's talk to 'em. Come on Higgins. We can't let this happen. We'll make Phillip give way if we have to wring his neck. You can count me out of this. Mr Monrell has just been good enough to accept my resignation. But Higgins, you can't leave us now. - I will not see the men wronged. I have stood by him this far for the old lady's sake. This is the end. I will talk to him alone. Higgins said you'd sent for the police. - The shouting was getting on my nerves. Your nerves? You'll start a massacre. - You get out here. Ring the Chief Constable and make him recall his men. I won't be bullied by you or anybody else. Alright then. I will do it myself. The police. They're here. Right outside the gates. You were too late you see. They're running and coming in the building. Coming up here? - What do you expect? The police must stop them. Where's the police? They're forcing the gate. You had best take Mrs Monrell down the back stairs. Hurry up, for heaven's sake. Do you want Stella to pay for your pig-headedness? Don't worry about me. I understand. That's what you both want. To see me run away. Well, I'll disappoint you. You can't be in the limelight all the time. Phillip, what are you going to do? I'll show them who's master here. - You can't. Why can't I? You think I am afraid? Stay here, all of you. I'll be in control. What you doing here? Call your coppers off. - How about Paley Brook? Yeah, what about it? - We want answers, is what we want. Will you give us our houses or shall we take them? Silence. How dare you break into this building. I'll have you arrested. Ah, shut your big mouth. They want to kill me. Give them their houses and anything else they want. Get out down the back stairs quick. You follow him. You look after Mrs Monrell. See she gets out safely. Ward, are you staying here? - They won't hurt me. You run along. - I'll stay with you. What do you want? - We want the boss. Where are you hiding him? - Mr Monrell left the building. He's decided to pass your housing project. He'd have told you himself just now if you'd given him a chance. You expect us to believe that? - Alright, men. Let's get him. I am sorry, Bill. I'll give you the chance to do the same thing to me someday. When we are through with the cottages we'll get the boss to build a gymnasium. Phillip, where have you been? Never mind. It doesn't matter now. No. It doesn't matter now. Nothing can hurt me. There is no need to be frightened. I will just .. Phillip! Stella, phone the doctor quick. Yes, Mr Monrell? Is the doctor still here? He left hours ago. It is past two o'clock. Where is Mr Andrews? He is still downstairs. How is he? - About the same. Stella, the doctor promised us he'd be alright. You look worn out. You'd better get some sleep. I will go. I will go soon. Not soon. Now. Come on, Stella. Hello there. Hello. Hello Phillip. - Hello. Thank you. How is the patient? So full of pep that I took him for a walk this morning. Right. That settles it. No more excuses for you to stay at home. Higgins is getting quite impatient. He wants you back at the office. He's not angry? Oh no. That is all forgotten. How kind everyone is. I hope I haven't been too much trouble lately. Fever is a funny thing. It makes everything look ugly like a mirror in a fun house. But we won't talk about that anymore. No, we won't. Well I must run along now. There has been an accident at the works. Yes. The nurse said something about it. What happened? It was a nasty business. Ted Dobson was working on one of the platforms. Trains run past there all day long full of molten slack. He must have lost this balance. Death? Pretty well instantaneous. A queer end. Nothing left but a bubble in molten steel. Nobody could cry over a block of steel could they. I would like to see the place. When you come back to the foundry you can look at it. No, I must go now. I'd like to show the men I take an interest in such things. But Phillip, are you strong enough? Dr McTernan said I could go out any time I wanted to. It will do me good. You sure you want to go up there? Of course. I am very curious. You go first. You had better watch your step. The rungs are a bit slippery. How do you feel? Don't worry about me. I'll be alright. You'd better stay where you are. It's awfully hot up here. I don't mind. Is that where it happened? Yes. He must have been standing over there when he fell. Right into the molten slag. We'll have to put up a safety rail and nets. Nets? How can you possibly get a net there? Oh, it is quite easy. You stay here. We can fasten it at both ends. The rail should be about one yard high and .. About two yards wide. You say no-one saw him fall? No. It is impossible to see up from below because of the glare. See how that glare comes up from there? Nobody can see anything. Please, Ward. Take me down. Quick. What is the matter with you two? You are both so quiet this evening. Ward is tired, dear. He's been working hard at the foundry all day. Just to make us rich. I'm just wondering when he is going to ask me for a raise. Take the hint, Ward. Now is your chance. He is in a generous mood. I will leave you two to finish your coffee. When you can't bear my piano playing any more, come and throw something at me. Isn't she wonderful? If she had her way she would make the whole world happy. Today, in the foundry. Why did you try to kill me? I am asking you a question, Phillip. Why did you try to kill me? Get out of this house. Don't worry. I'm leaving. I was going to do that anyway. I was only hoping that you would be man enough to me to me openly. But you couldn't. Your whole mind is distorted with jealousy. You've taken her away from me. - I know exactly what you think. And I don't have to lie to you. I am in love with Stella. I believe I've loved her ever since we first met. But get this into your head. Stella doesn't know anything at all about it. There has never been anything between us. Not the slightest thought or word. Stella is my wife. She doesn't need your excuses. This is my house. I have already told you to leave it. Phillip. Ward, what is the matter? It is all my fault, Stella. I am going away. Ward, please tell me what happened. Come on. Tell her, Ward. It would be a shame to say goodbye without an explanation. This seems to be confession time. Why not make a thorough job of it? Believe me, Stella. This concerns only Phillip and myself. That is not exactly true. Ward was just telling me that he is in love with you. Is that true, Ward? Yes, Stella. I should have gone away long ago. Well, you've heard him. He is only waiting for a word from you. Don't consider my feelings. Goodbye, Ward. Goodbye, Stella. If you should ever need me. London is not very far away you know. Has he gone? Yes. He has gone. And you have gone with him. I beg your pardon madam, but .. You haven't eaten anything. Cook is getting quite worried if I may say so. I am not hungry. Thank you, Clark. Has Mr Phillip had his supper yet? I took his tray up half an hour ago, madam. Madam, if there is anything that you want. At any time. You know we will be glad to serve you. All of us. Thank you, Clark. Oh Stella. This is a pleasant surprise. Come in. I was just reading your last letter to mother. "Phillip and I are so happy." How charming of you to say that. Then you always were so considerate. Never a word of complaint. No-one could say that you weren't a loyal wife. You opened my letters? Yes, of course. All of them. Here is the one you wrote to Ward. Just after he left. "Phillip and talked everything over and we've decided to make a fresh start." Don't worry. I will send it on to him later. It was so beautiful that wanted to keep it. So that I could read it again. We are so unhappy, aren't we. All three of us. You, because you love Ward and have to stay with me. Ward, because he loves you and can't have you. Phillip. We can't go on like this. Anyway, I can't. These last weeks. It is as if we've been playing some horrible kind of game. What is the matter, Phillip? Why are you so cruel? Look at me. Look at me. I am your wife. Do you want me here anymore? Yes I do, Stella. I do. Only when Ward went away I lost you too. Now I am all alone. But you are not alone. We can still be happy together. I will do anything you want. Listen. Couldn't we go way together? Right now. Let's forget everything that has happened. We can't stay in this house. And we can't stay in this hour torturing each other. Let's put an end to it. We will put an end to it. We two. Together. Then I will have you all to myself. At last. It is so easy. Don't be frightened. You know I wouldn't hurt you. No. No, don't! Stella. You don't know how happy I am. I thought I'd never see you again. I thought so too, Ward. But why didn't you call me sooner? I would have met the train. At first I didn't mean to come to you. You see, I know I haven't the right to be here, but .. When I found myself on the platform among all those strangers. I felt so terribly alone. Thank heavens you did come. Listen, Stella. There is something I must tell you. My feelings for you haven't changed and they never will. But you came here because you needed a friend and please think of me as that. Thank you, Ward. Everything will be alright now. He is mad, Ward. I know he is. Poor Stella. You must have suffered terribly. I should never have left you alone there with him. But that is all over now. I am going to call Phillip and tell him that you are here with me. Oh. You mustn't. He can't talk to people anymore. You see. It's as if he was always listening to a voice inside his own head. He will listen to me. I will call him now. Paging Mr Andrews. Mr Ward .. - Here, boy. You are wanted on the telephone, sir. It's a long-distance from Chassingford. He certainly timed it well. - Don't speak to him, Ward. There is nothing to be afraid of. Hello? Hello Phillip. Yes. She is here. And she is not coming back to you. Even if she wanted to I wouldn't let her. I deserved it. I'll give her a divorce any time she wants it. I'd like to talk it over with you as soon as possible. No, no. Not in London. I would be too near Stella. You know how I feel. Alright then. I'll come down and see you. Don't go to him. No. Don't go. Tomorrow? No, I can't. I have to be in Dublin tomorrow. Then it is quite simple. You take the midday train up here. I lend you the 2-seater. You can drive to Holyhead and take a boat from there. That's all settled then. I'll look forward to seeing you. Goodbye. Alright. Please don't go. - Stella, you are tired. You are tired and upset. After all, it's perfectly natural for Phillip to want to see me. Ward, I am so afraid. I am so afraid something may happen to you. Don't worry, Stella. I can take care of myself. Oh, Clark. Take these in to Chassingford to catch the post, will you. Yes, sir. Will there be anything further? Let me see. Cook and Annie have their day off. You had better stop in and see if there is anything I want when you come back. And .. lock all the doors and windows, will you. One can't be too careful. - Careful, sir? Well, I am not expecting burglars. But everyone has some enemies, haven't they. That's all. You can go, Clark. Hello, Ward. - Good evening, Phillip. I am glad you are here. I began to think you weren't coming. - Oh, why? I thought you might be frightened. You know I am not to be trusted. That's alright. I think I'll take the risk. Let's go in the library. Sit down. - Thanks. Whiskey? - No thank you. You don't mind if I drink alone? Of course. Go ahead. - Oh. Would you mind ringing? I would like to have some fresh soda. Oh, how very stupid of me. There is no-one here. I sent Clark into Chassingford. I expect I'll be needing quite a bit of this stuff now that my .. Wife has left me. My dear wife has left me. How funny that sounds. It's like a funeral announcement. When in reality Stella is the very opposite from dead. She is just about to begin a marvellous new life. Phillip. Neither of us knows what Stella is going to do in the future. We are here for one purpose only. To help her. After all, she is the one who has suffered most. Oh yes. Well. I will give Stella a divorce. I have already spoken to my lawyer about that. Also, I have guaranteed not to alter my will. You see, I hope that someday. Stella will feel that she can forgive me. I think she has forgiven you already. Nobody is your enemy, Phillip. We have been through a bad time, the three of us. And you're not the only one who it to blame. That is very generous of you, Ward. [ Whistling sounds ] [ Whistling sounds ] But you can afford to be generous, can't you. Now you've got what you want. I should have thrown you out of this house months ago. When you were cheating me and lying behind my back. - Phillip. Let's drop all pretences. Let's call things by their right names just for once. I gave you a job. I paid you. I thought you were my friend. And how did you repay my friendship? By stealing my wife. What's wrong with you? - I got her from the gutter. She throws herself at the first man she finds. Leave Stella out of this. - I've kept quiet enough. Now you are going to hear the truth. I won't need anything more tonight, Clark. Thank you. Goodnight. - Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir. From the moment you got into that steel mill you turned the men against me. You made them start the strike. - That's a lie. I didn't know it. You wanted a chance to prove to Stella you were a hero. You think I don't know that you and she .. If you don't shut up I'll break your neck. I'm sorry, Ward. When I am upset I say terrible things. It is because I love Stella so much. You know, old boy, you really ought to take a hold of yourself. You ought to get right away from this house for a while. Yes, that is what I must do. I must get away. Well, I must be going now. Yes. You mustn't miss your boat. Just a minute. By the way, what are you doing in Dublin? An engineer named Leahy .. Called me this morning. He's interested in my invention. A friend of yours? No. I never heard of him before in my life. I seem to be getting quite famous. Yes. Yes, you must be. You can go out this way. The car is waiting for you in the garage. When you get to Holyhead take it to the Central Hotel. And tell them a Mister Stevens will call for it. He's the mechanic who's going to bring it back. Alright. Thanks. And don't forget my advice, Phillip. Take care of yourself, won't you. Don't worry, Ward. And don't think too badly of me. Whatever I may have done, whatever I do. You and Stella are the two people I love most in the world. Oh. You have seen the weapon with which the mortal blow was struck. A knife which Mr Monrell used as a paper cutter. The witness Clark has testified that it was lying on his master's desk. Within convenient reach of a would-be assassin. On the handle of that knife. Ward Andrews' fingerprints are clearly visible. Now, how did they get there? He is utterly unable to explain. He insisted he never touched that knife and never even noticed it. Now the defence has suggested. That the telephone call which Mr Andrews received .. From Phillip Monrell on the morning of the crime .. Was an invitation to visit him that afternoon. Now, if that is so. Why did Mr Monrell say nothing about it to his butler? Why did he tell Clark about some mysterious enemy? If Monrell as it is claimed, had already agreed to grant his wife a divorce. Why did the two men exchange those violent words .. Which Clark overheard through the library door and why .. If the final parting between them was friendly. Does the room show signs of a desperate struggle? Where chairs were overturned, curtains torn, and a vase smashed to atoms. Mr Andrews' footprints .. show .. That he left the house by the library window. And drove away in Mrs Monrell's car. Scraping the mudguard against the garage door. It was left in Holyhead. To be called for by a "Mr Stevens", a mechanic. Who was to drive it back to its owner. But the defence is unable to produce this Mr Stevens. For the excellent reason that he doesn't exist. Mr Andrews it seems .. Has a weakness for fictitious characters. He was going to Ireland he says. To interview a certain Mr Leahy. But Mr Leahy doesn't exist either. Mr Andrews was in fact on his way to keep an assignation with Stella Monrell. Consider this woman. The principal witness for the defence. She cannot deny that she deserted her husband. Members of the jury. It is your plain duty .. To ask yourselves on the basis of the evidence you have heard .. Did Ward Andrews kill Phillip Monrell? If the answer to that question is "yes". Then you are bound to return against the prisoner the verdict .. Of guilty of wilful murder. Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed upon your verdict? We are. Do you find the prisoner Ward Andrews .. Guilty or not guilty of the murder of Phillip Monrell? Guilty, sir. Prisoner at the bar. You stand convicted of murder. He you anything to say why the court should not .. Give you the judgment of death according to law? I am innocent. Ward Andrews. You have been given a fair and careful trial and found guilty. The sentence of the court upon you is .. That you be taken from hence .. To a lawful prison and from thence to a place of execution. And you shall be there .. Hanged by the neck until you are dead. And that your body shall be buried in the precincts of the prison .. Where you shall have last been confined after your conviction. And may The Lord have mercy on your soul. Amen. You mustn't do that. You will put yourself in check. No. Sorry. I really should not play anymore. Just as you like. Would you rather be alone? - Please don't go, Padre. If I'm alone I start thinking of her. I haven't been very much trouble to you so far, have I Padre. If I can't see her now I don't see how I will get through these next 12 hours. My boy, you know that isn't in my power. Can't I just see her once? Just for a minute. They have got to let me see her. They have got to. - Steady, Ward. I am sorry. It isn't easy, you know. This whole business keeps going round and round in my head. Perhaps tomorrow morning I shall understand everything. Governor, I had to come once more. Dear Mrs Monrell, I can't say anything that I didn't tell you yesterday .. Or the day before, or the day before that. This is the last day. There are certain regulations .. Concerning visits to condemned prisoners. I didn't make them. Don't you understand anything but regulations and laws and rules? No madam. I understand nothing but my duties. That is my job. Yes? Pleases, sir. Perhaps you can help me. You believe in kindness and mercy. Won't you help me to see Mr Andrews? My child. Don't you think you would make it more difficult for him? I won't. I promise I won't. The law can't be so cruel as to let him die know without knowing .. Knowing what, my child? That I love him. But surely, Mrs Monrell. He must be aware of that already. I know what you think but you are wrong. There has never been anything between us. Of course we love each other but I never told him. Never! Don't you understand? If he doesn't see me he'll think I have deserted him too. Do you mind if I take Mrs Monrell out by the back way? Past the cells. Well. As long as she is on her way out I don't think there is any rule against that. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bill, the Governor asked me to talk to you about that hot water pipe. It is leaking again. - What pipe, sir? This one over here. Oh, I see. Stella. Ward. There is so much to say. Don't say anything, darling. This is all I wanted to know. I'm afraid we will have to be moving on. - Please, just another moment. This can't happen. Something must help us. America. Would you believe that? I will. My key please. Wasn't that Mrs Monrell? Yes, that is her. - Beautiful. Beautiful. - Between you and me. The manager will be glad to get rid of her. They are hanging her gentleman friend tomorrow morning. 3 o'clock sharp. Too bad you can't watch it though. You would enjoy it, wouldn't you? Animals. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I have nothing to say. Whatever you want to know you can find it in the newspapers. Two years ago. This man escaped from a private asylum. Near Paris. He was suffering from a form of insanity which we call paranoia. At that time your husband masqueraded under the name of "Ward Andrews". Who are you? How do you know all this? I am the old fool who let him escape. My name is Dr Rameau. Enchanté. But doctor, this is terribly important. Why didn't you come here weeks ago? I discovered it only yesterday. May I sit down? - Of course. Please. My old bones dislike your English climate intensely. But I was in Edinburgh listening to some ignorant rubbish. At a so-called Medical Congress when I happened to pick up this paper. What stupidity. What self-contradiction. You are the only intelligent witness. You at least suspected that your late husband was insane. They wouldn't listen to me. Because of .. Because of my friendship with Mr Andrews. Come on. Sit down. Do you believe that Mr Andrews killed your husband? Doctor, I am certain he didn't. But the evidence? Evidence, evidence. I spit on evidence. My dear child, forget all the circumstantial rubbish. These knives. These broken vases. These footprints. They are too convenient. Too perfect. Look into the human heart. And you will find the motive for this crime. But if Ward didn't, then who? Phillip was murdered by his only enemy: himself. Everything you told the jury supports my diagnosis. He hides from the world in the tree of his childhood. He creates a neurotic jealousy. And nourishes it like a plant. He tries to destroy everything which he imagines could come between you and him. First the poor little animal. Then his best friend. And last, he tries to, kill you and himself. Don't you see? Now, with one stroke he almost succeeded. A classic case. Wonderful. But how did he do it and how can we prove it? We need prove nothing. Phillip will prove it for us. That sounds insane but let me tell you. Some of my crazy patients are wiser than all your judges and jurymen. Now listen carefully. This disease takes many forms. But one symptom is common to all its sufferers. Their poor sick brains want to show off. To tell the world: 'I am cleverer than you'. They long for recognition but every normal road to it is barred. So they turn to crime. But the crime itself means nothing unless it is talked about. These people when they commit suicide .. Leave lengthy statements. When they murder. They .. love to confess. Your husband. Will want to speak to you from beyond the grave. His triumph will not be final until you know the truth. Madame, I stake my reputation upon it. A message exists. But .. can we find it before it is too late? We must find it. Come, doctor. Nothing. Nothing at all. There isn't anything here either. You're sure, Clark, there's no more in the cellar? Certain. I brought everything upstairs. - But it must be somewhere. It must. I will try Mrs Monrell's room. - Please don't do that, madam. Mrs Monrell is very ill and it would be a terrible shock for her. Mother. Clark, how dare you bring them here against my orders. It wasn't his fault. We had to come. There was a terrible mistake. I'll explain. I do not know you, but I ask you to take this lady out of my house immediately. I am sorry but we are not going away until we find what we are looking for. Madame, you must excuse our behaviour. But a man's life is at stake. Ward Andrews did not kill your son. You must be mad. I knew your son. He said to me once. I am going to die like my father. What did your husband die of Mrs Monrell? Yes. You don't know how important this is. You always told me he died so suddenly. You think that your son now is the victim of a crime. Do you want him to become a murderer? You really think Phillip killed himself too? I am certain of it. I knew it. You must get upstairs. If I could only help somehow. Perhaps you can help, Mrs Monrell. Please, think carefully. When your son was a boy. Did he have some secret hiding place? Where he used to hide his treasures. He had no secrets from me. He told me everything. He even let me read his precious diaries. Where are those diaries, mother? They are over there in that chest but they will be no use to you now. He finished the last one before he met you. Come, doctor. It's our only chance. Are these the only ones you have? All that I have in the world now that he is gone. Please don't take them away from me. But where is the next volume? There must be another. I saw him writing in it. He must have hidden it somewhere. You mustn't have it until it's too late. - Look. Why didn't I think of that? He always had his favourite books rebound there. Clark. - Yes, madam? Clark, tell us exactly what you remember. What did Mr Phillip do that last day? Did he by any chance give you a package? A small one about this size? Yes. Now I come to think of it there was a package. Where was he sending it to? To Paris? Yes. It was somewhere on the continent. It had to have a lot of extra stamps. Thank heavens. We are on the right track at last. Clark, call the airport and charter a plane for Paris. And Clark. Take this note immediately to Chassingford prison. Monrell. Voila, Madame. Give it to me. [ French language ] What is the matter now? My child, for the first time in 50 years this old brain has been of some use. Mr Andrews is saved. I don't understand. Your husband told him to keep the diary until next September. And then send it to you. Give me that book. Give it here. - Madame. Taisez-vous. A telephone. A telephone. Quick. Où est le téléphone? Pas de téléphone. No telephone? But where can we get one? Monsieur. Taxi. - Taxi! Taxi! What are we going to do? Head back. Perhaps we can wake somebody up. Ouvre. Ouvre. It is no use, doctor. It will be too late. But doctor. Come, look. Let's go. May we use your telephone? - Pour quoi? Téléphone. - Ah, téléphone. Là-bas. Hello? Hello. Please connect me with the long distance. Oui. Long distance. What you say? Long distance on my telephone? Taisez-vous. We have to make a call to England. England? Who is going to pay for this? - You will get your money. Hello? I want Chassingford, England. Long distance. 0ui, it is urgent. You will get your money. I cannot find it now. [ French language ] Hello. I want Chassingford. Please give me the prison. A call from Paris, sir. They say it's very urgent. Hello? Yes. It is the governor speaking. Hello, the governor? Thank god. Listen. This is Mrs Monrell. I am going to read you something. It is my husband's diary. We have just discovered it. It proves that Mr Andrews is innocent. Listen. "July the 10th." "4:20pm. Dear Stella." "In another three hours I shall have killed myself." "When you read this, Ward will have been hanged for my murder." "I have everything arranged." "They must not know it was suicide or the whole plan will fail." Poor Phillip. Too many people have looked into his secrets. We must let him rest now. --(tg)--
