So, we just need to check their passports carefully. Check their profile. Always look at their photo. Place it in the scanner. You see the database here, and if you see something strange, then you can check under the UV light. This is a French passport. So, it has this fluorescent ink, as you see here. The texture is a bit different. Just make sure you check all the requirements to ensure that it is a legitimate, valid passport.

You mean to go to school. Adja stupid. Yeah. Can you comb it so it sticks up? Your son brought this to school. We, of course, assumed it was yours... and were about to contact the authorities. But your friend tells us it belongs to her. You have to be careful what kind of people you let around your child. Yes. This could have gone terribly wrong. Yes. I will make sure this is disposed of.
