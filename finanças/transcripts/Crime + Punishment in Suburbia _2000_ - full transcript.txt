(MOANING) (MOANS) VINCENT: Roseanne Skolnick was pretty. And she had money. And she worked hard to be liked. But that didn't mean that guys like me could talk to her. (CAMERA CLICKING) (GROWLING) (GASPS) (GIGGLES) (WHISPERING) Come on, stop it. (WHISPERING) I want it. Later. Why are you acting so tough? 'Cause I'm made that way. Cut it out! I'm serious!

(WHISTLES) What the fuck? Come on. Mmm. (GIGGLES) Do you want to learn something worth knowing? Do I have a choice? When we're having sex and you push into me really hard, do you think that's what gets me off? I don't know. The fact is, you could give me an orgasm without Jimmy Junior ever coming out of your pants. I don't think Jimmy Junior would like that. He'd get over it. (EXCLAIMS) Guess what I'm not wearing? (EXHALES) You're so sexy. (CAMERA CLICKING) FRED: Maggie? What are these nice clothes you got laid out? Are you getting dressed up for me? She's trying to impress me. She's going to a rock concert. It's not a rock concert, I'm just going out with Bella. (LAUGHS) Bella's coming. better hide the food. Will you relent, please, Fred? How was work today, Dad? What do you want to know for? She's just curious, Fred. Why don't you cut the kid a break? I spent my day chained to my desk, surrounded by sycophants. You like it better when you were making your own sales, right, Dad? Yeah. Miss the freedom. Just you and the customer. It's a blood sport. If you miss the road, Fred, nobody's stopping you. I'd rather be home with my family. Tell me something about this concert? It's not a concert. It's a piano bar. The kind of place you met Ted in? You know who I'm talking about, don't you? Yes, I know who you're talking about. The man that's supposed to be your father! Shut up! It's just a piano bar. It's just me and Bella. It is not a rock concert! And I met Ted at a jazz concert. Sweetie, could you get me another beer, please? Grab one for yourself while you're out there. VINCENT'S MOTHER: Vincent, you want dinner? VINCENT: No (EXHALES) VINCENT: Why was I in love with her? I could make up lots of reasons. But the truth is it wasn't about reason. (GROANS) "Por Nada." "There is no faith." There is no reason why things happen the way they do. They just do.

We had a dog. I've seen pictures. (TURNS OFF TV) Your mom and I were only dating then. You were just a baby. I was five when you started dating. You know what happened the night she died. Fifi, I mean. I walked your mother to the door to that place she was staying in. That dump. That dog was squealing, hemorrhaging its guts out. There was blood everywhere. I held that little dog in my arms until it croaked. That was the first night you ever called me "Daddy". I took that little dog to the vet that night because your mother said she couldn't cope. When I got back in, you know what she said to me? Kindness is the most important thing. Kindness is the most important thing. Why can't your mommy be kind to me now? Excuse me, I'd like two Bloodhounds, please? Blood? You mean Greyhounds? Fine. (BOTH LAUGHING) Greyhounds, I can do. Can I start a tab, please? Sure. You driving? No, my girlfriend is. Girlfriend?

(BRAKES SCREECHING) What's going on? Nothing. Because Roseanne likes you doesn't mean you can jerk me around. Don't touch me unless you love me. Are you some kind of fag? Think about it. If I was, would I admit it to you? (LAUGHS) I don't know. Maybe you would. Maybe you wouldn't. You mean a lot to her. (SCOFFS) It's a lot of responsibility. You gotta give her lots of love and treat her with special care. Yeah? Forget it! What? No, you forget it, punk. I don't wanna see you talkin' to her, near her and not even at the goddamn school!

Eighteen. Oh, 18. (CHUCKLES) I was 18 once. But I didn't play football or date the cheerleaders. I got one later, a used one. But she's not here right now. The less said about that, the better.

What excited everyone was how much it bothered her. The vultures were circling and they smelled blood. Don't worry. About what? About you? About my grades? About what? About the bullshit that people say. None of it's such a big deal. We'll all be dead sooner or later. That's a cheerful thought. I'm not here to cheer you up. What is your specialty, Vincent? The truth. That's the only thing that ever helped anybody. Didn't I tell you to stay away from me? You're a freak! VINCENT: She was going down. It was so obvious. ROSEANNE: Mom? Where are you? Mom? Mom, I had the weirdest feeling. Are you okay? Roseanne, honey? You're going to be okay. What? I promise. Mom, you're scaring me. (SNIFFLING) You know that I can't live with Fred anymore. What about me? In two weeks, we're gonna start visiting colleges. We can make that like road trips if they're far enough away. That'd be fun, right? What are you talking about? I need this to be very clear to you, honey. This is just temporary. Till then I get Dad all on me. It's just for a little while, Roseanne. You have to act like a grown-up for me, okay? Okay? Okay. (CAMERA CLICKING) How's school? I love it. If they had it at night, I'd never leave. It's going to be interesting to see what you're like when you get out of this gloomy stage.

A helicopter swooped down and looked at that boy standing on top of his chimney. Water was up to his Adam's apple. The guy took out a bullhorn and said, "Catch a hold of the rope. "This is your last chance!" "God's gonna take care of me!" About that time, the water went over his head and he drowned and he was dead.

She's being booked at the station. You can go see her there. VINCENT: When the police answered the 911 call, Maggie was still hysterical. They asked her three questions, then they read her her rights. She was bitter. Pissed at the world for the way it treated her for decades. (CAMERA CLICKING) She knew she was born to lose.

No. No, I don't. It only makes sense. I must have said it 100 times. I wished for it. I wanted it. No, Mom. You let Grandma take care of you. I'll be okay. VINCENT: The police were excited. It was the first big murder of the season. They were steadily building a case against Maggie. Her obvious motive. Her repeated public claim that she would kill him. The lack of forced entry into the house. The neighbor's witness to the fight earlier. Her discovery of the body. Her fingerprints all over the murder weapon. Hold it, big smile. (CAMERA CLICKING) Beautiful. At the arraignment, bail was set at a million dollars. She couldn't post bond. Now, no one talked to Roseanne. (BELL RINGING) And she almost never spoke.

PROSECUTOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The People will prove Margaret Skolnik did stab to death her husband. The People will prove she had motive. An unhappy marriage. An insurance policy. Threats to his life. VINCENT: All the prosecution had was stuff that Maggie touched after the body and a motive. Maggie's attorney was making short work of that. Now, the state as you've heard says it has motive. A bad relationship? Which one of us has not been in a bad relationship? Does that make us murderers? An insurance policy. Which of us does not have an insurance policy? Mrs. Maggie Skolnik is innocent. She is innocent. (SIGHING) I can't stop looking at my mom.

What are you hanging with that freak for? Jimmy, please, calm down! I don't get it! You've gone crazy, Roseanne. I was just... You were what? It's not that I'm with him. I wanna be with you. JIMMY: Why? I missed you. We should wait till the trial's over. All right. Bye. What? What's it like to be a fag? VINCENT: I believe with all my heart that God is loving and just. If Maggie goes to jail and Roseanne is martyred, there is a reason. For now, it's a mystery. All I have is my faith. The prosecution created a compelling saga of Maggie as a sex-mad harlot who savagely murdered her older husband to be with her young, virile boyfriend. For his part, Chris seemed calm, thoughtful, intelligent. He was good on the stand. It didn't matter, Maggie wasn't. Didn't you say you wished your husband was dead? Yes. And when you found the body? MAGGIE: I was like what strange God did this? (WHIRRING) You have to be able to live with yourself. That's most important. How? Like this! (SCREAMING) (GASPING) (CHATTERING ON TV) Can't sleep? Neither can I. It's just too quiet. I thought moving to the desert was a good idea. Dry and nice. Who's that? A friend. What's wrong? I couldn't sleep. Nobody can. Do you want to go do something? Yeah. VINCENT'S MOTHER: Vincent? Bring your friend inside. Let's get out of here. I love you. You barely know me. I know you more than you think. Yeah? Yeah. VINCENT: We kept passing motels. I wondered if she'd go into one of them if I asked her. But I never did. I didn't have any money anyway. ROSEANNE: Did you ever have a girlfriend? When I was 14 in New York, I knew this college chick named Naomi. (CHUCKLES) An older woman. I'm impressed. We did crazy stuff together. I wanted something to happen 'cause she was super foxy. What crazy stuff? One night, she took me to this place her friend lived in. Nobody was home. Steam pipes were leaking, there was a hot haze in the room. We sat down and smoked crack. What was that like? Your mind takes off like a jet plane. Soon, you've gone through the sound barrier. And everything goes dead, then you crash. Then you want to die. Whatever happened between you and Naomi? Nothing. She left me. I never saw her again. Poor Vincent. (SIGHING) In an hour, the sun comes up. And then what? It all starts all over again. Ladies and gentlemen, we live in confusing times. VINCENT: The trial was winding down. Many issues cloud our perception. The lawyers were starting to make their closing statements. But the fact remains she wanted him dead. She hated him and she killed him. Murder must be punished. It was clear Maggie was going to jail. (CAMERA CLICKING) (WHISPERING) Jimmy! What are you doing here? I need to talk to you. About what? I need to talk to you. Come here! What are you doing here? I saw you with him. You were kissing him I had to. As part of your big plan, right? Bullshit! Jimmy, stop it! (SHUSHING) Not here. We can talk about this later. Wait a second. You never call me back. Jimmy, you're being crazy. What are you... Fucking him? No. I'm not fucking him. I'm never going to forget what happened that night. It's giving me nightmares! I'm never going to get better. (PANTING) How can you live with yourself? You should be in goddamn jail! (SHUSHING) Jimmy, please. I gotta go. Fucking cunt! Let me go! Wait. Wait! I loved you. (FLUSHING) (SIGHS) VINCENT: I used to think if I killed somebody, I'd wanna go to the cemetery and apologize. That's not really what guilt is though. Guilt's a feeling you have towards people who are living. Every day you're out there, shaking hands, talking. But you, the guilty person, you know that it's all unreal. It's like guilt is the secret inside of you that destroys the fabric of everything. Then everything's unreal and you can't even have a life. But it's not necessary for it to destroy you. You just have to face it. Big football star like you, you gotta graduate to cocktails more befitting your status. Irish whiskey. That will be your drink from now on. (CHUCKLES) I bet you get a lot of pussy. I used to dream about killing the cop that shot my dad, I even took the ferry to Staten Island one time. I hid outside of his house all day long. Took pictures. Do you still hate him? Sometimes. (LAUGHS) But it makes me feel like a damaged little fucker. I'm scared all the time. Everything will turn out all right. When? I don't know. Give me a beer, Russ. What's going on, Jimmy? Don't you have any damn pride? (LAUGHS) What about the game? What about the team? Do my head. What'd you say? (LAUGHING) I said, do my head! Smartass motherfucker! Don't ever talk to me like that! (COACH GROANING) (CAMERA CLICKING) (PISSING) You all right? Yeah, leave me alone. I don't think you're in any condition to drive, dude. (GROANS) (LAUGHS) It's you. Yeah, it's me. You're such a weirdo. I don't even know why I listen to you. 'Cause your heart knows I can see it. Don't throw up in my car. If you have to throw up, let me know, I'll pull over. Don't throw up in here, I'm not bullshitting you. I didn't do anything. (SIGHING) I want to go home. First, we find Roseanne and we'll straighten this out. Then I'll take you anywhere you wanna go. I'll be right back. Okay. Will you get my wallet? It's in my bag. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. You knew. What? You knew that... You know that I... That you murdered your stepfather? Of course, I knew. You're insane. I followed you. I took a lot of pictures that night. Why didn't you take them to the police? Why would I take them to the police? I hate the police. What do you want from me? I don't want anything from you. What are you gonna make me do? I'm not going to make you do anything. I'm trying to help you. You're not normal. You're completely fucking insane! Look at this. Where are you gonna go? I'm getting out of here! I'm going to hitch a ride and you're never gonna see me again! Where are you going to run to? I'm not going to tell anybody! You don't have to do this! Fuck off! (GROANING) Get your asshole up here. What's going on? What's going on? JIMMY: I wanna go home. Shut the fuck up! Your mom is in jail. What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it? Hang out with this knucklehead? Learn how to get fucked? (GUNSHOT) (THUDDING) (ROSEANNE PANTING) I didn't do that. I didn't do that. Get out of here. I didn't do that. Go! Go! Call 911. VINCENT: Jimmy suffered severe internal damage. He was taken to the Emergency Room unconscious. Chris took flight and disappeared. He was reported armed and dangerous. What are you doing? Breaking in. It's harder than it looks. Are you crazy? Why didn't you knock on the door? I don't know. I wanted to sneak in. Why? (SNICKERS) Nice boxers. Thanks. They're gonna convict my mom tomorrow. That doesn't matter. She'll probably get three to four years after they're done with the appeal. Jimmy is still unconscious. That's not your fault. What are you saying? I should feel good? You can turn everything around anytime you want to. What if I don't want to? Your heart wants to. I hate it when you say things like that. It's true. I couldn't love you if... You know what I said to myself? That if he starts talking about love and God, I'd kill him. I know you can do it. Help me. I can't. (SOBBING) Why? I can't make you. You have to do it. It has to be your choice. I don't want to choose. I want it all to go away. It's not going to go away. Go to hell. ROSEANNE: When I felt the knife in him, I wanted to stop. But it was too late. After I stabbed him the first time, he didn't die. So, I grabbed the electric carving knife. Jimmy was so scared. He's always scared. I had to do it, I had to kill him. We burned our bloody clothes by the Frontage Road. And afterwards we rode our bikes back to school. (CAMERA CLICKING) I killed him because I hated him. When they kept asking me, I told them what he did to me. My charge was reduced to manslaughter. I like it in here. It's like I don't exist. I wrote a letter to Jimmy but he never wrote back. I signed an affidavit that said he didn't do anything. I scared him into not telling. It was basically true. He never was formally charged. Kids talked a lot about me cutting Fred up. They brought in counselors for people that were freaked out. I was a monster. It wasn't very complicated. The police caught Chris and he got three years for kidnapping and first degree assault. He just wanted to protect Mom. His jury didn't see things that way. Mom moved away and waited near to where Chris was imprisoned. She has Chris and some money. I think she's finally happy. I don't really talk to her. Vincent visited me but I couldn't bring myself to speak to him. There really wasn't much to say. I killed somebody. I was sorry. That would change nothing. Time went by. The 7-Eleven was robbed. The owner was murdered. Later in the year, the mayor's son got high on beer and cocaine and killed a guy with his car. Almost everyone forgot about me. At the end of my first year, I caught pneumonia which was good. I was surprised when I got better. Vincent didn't come anymore. But I would go out to the yard and sit anyway. Nobody ever stopped me. Hey. You didn't show up. My mom got sick. I had to take care of her. Didn't they tell you? No, they didn't tell me. You're talking. I missed you. Do you think I could... Do you think that I could maybe believe in the things that you believe in? Yeah. Yeah, I do.
