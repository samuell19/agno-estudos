- All news, all the time. - This is 1010 Wins. When you give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world. - Good morning. - 64 degrees at 8 o'clock. It's Tuesday, September 11th. I am Lee Harris, here's what's happening. It's primary day and the polls are open in New York city - Uptown FDR drive is backed up from the Brooklyn Bridge to Houston Street with an accident blocking two lanes. Another accident further north, at the 70's is cleared. - Not like this is any big surprise, but anything Michael Jordan does makes big news and this morning, it appears at age 38, He indeed will be coming out of retirement again. - What's up with Whitney Houston? Certainly not her weight. The painfully skinny singer was no-show at Michael Jackson's anniversary concert last night A friend says blame it on drug abuse. Breaking news now on 1010 Wins. - This just in to our newsroom, a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. They just played the tape again. It is horrific. A second plane, the size of a passenger jet flying into the second tower of the World Trade Center. - What happened? - I dunno, your guess is as good as mine. - Two airbuses evidently were taken from LaGuardia. Yeah, yeah. My father's got ABC on and he said that they've got footage of the airplane actually hitting, hitting the towers. And... They said that there's some... There's a report that they, hi dad. Sorry. I know a lot of the cell phone towers are on the World Trade Center. That's why this keeps cutting out. Some people don't have any service. What do they know about LaGuardia? - You guys know what happened? - Hm? - Do you know what happened? - Two planes crashed there... - Hijacked planes, two hijacked planes. - Really? - Yeah. - You guys see it? - Huh? - You guys see it? - What do you think happened? - Hijacked plane, what you can do. It's suicide, suicide bombers. - How does it make you feel? - Terrible, like, I've never seen something like this. - I know, I got a feeling, like that very like, surreal. I don't know how to feel. - Is now being evacuated so this phone call will be cut short. All of the public building as you've heard, probably on your news. All of our rails and all of our bridges have been closed. The debris is blocked from the World Trade Center as it exists right now. Literally as we're speaking, people are either jumping out of the building from 60, 70, 80, 90 floor up... - Whoa! - Oh shit! Holy shit! People are jumping out of buildings on the 80th floor. People are jumping out of the buildings on the 80th floor. - and obviously this emphasizes the horrendous personal toll. - Oh - As many as 50, perhaps even more we onboard on one of the planes that crashed so... - So that means, if that's true... - It had to be a hijack, 50 people were on board. - a lot of these things that are coming into the newsroom, but that indicates a possibility of a hijack. - The FBI had said that they were investigating a possibility... - Holy Christ. - A hijacking just before the crash occurred. So that may be part of the story there. And it looked to me, watching the video of the second plane, it looked to me that, that was a 737 or at least a comparable size... - Two planes. To a 737 aircraft... - 737. - 172 and 182 and it was moving at least 300 miles an hour when it hit the building. Now you have to believe... - That had to be the explosion we saw. - Live shots and somebody might've gotten a shot at that thing. So we could identify it because we don't know if that was an airliner. We don't know right now, all we saw was just a shot of it hitting the second tower... - That is horrible, people jumping out of the freaking windows. - This plane, who was on at least the second plane, the one that we saw. - It sounds serious, as you heard Commissioner Jerry Demorada there, abandoning the emergency service... Set up exactly for these kind of emergencies because of the danger that comes their way and others who are in nearby buildings surrounding the World Trade Center. We just got a report in that unidentified persons saying as well that American airliner, 767 from Boston that were coming in from Boston, with the plane. But again, they're unidentified sources on the second plane, that is the second plane that came in and flew into one of the towers. - All you saw was a huge explosion, just now. A huge explosion. Part of the plane just actually fell inside the building. The other part of the plane went through the building. And some of the plane exploded and fell onto the street. - Smoke came out. People were saying that there was there. And the second building was fine. And then 15 minutes later. You get a good view way down there. - What a view, yeah. - You see that up close? Yeah it's so bad over there. - Oh yeah? - I was one of the carpenters that worked on that building. - It's the only way they're gonna get to that building. - Did you leave a message on Ilene's machine? - I spoke to her, I left a message before. It's was just an answer, it was almost nonchalant. You know? And then she goes, "I have to call you back" I go, "Yeah", you know? - I just heard it right here, subways are down - The airports are closed. - Yeah, everything's down. - How will you get back? The freight's closed, that's it. I was told the security of the building was the main concern. - I'll tell you one thing. But if it is, it was sabotage. Once and for all, you know, we have to do something about it, you know? - What you gonna do? - What do you think? - How are you? - You think it's a bomb? - What? - You think it's a bomb? - Yeah. Yeah, the same thing. - You guys ever see anything like this? - Of course, unfortunately the first thing that comes to your mind is one thing. Not us. Unfortunately, maybe it's unfair. You know what they say, that Bin Laden... - Bin Laden, Bin Laden. You know how many lives, that's a helicopter. - Those people didn't have a chance. - Not a fighting chance. - I'll tell you one thing. Including was 848, that there was, you know, a lot of people, that didn't have a chance to go. - Some way the missile at the Woolworth building. Where's the Woolworth building? - It's downtown. - Down the N2, they're saying before the second one impacted, a possible missile was fired at the Woolworth Building. - The ladies say they hear it. I don't know yet. But you know, they're gonna be people trapped under the rubble, all of them. - The fire that is being reported at this hour at the Pentagon and associated press reporter saying that he saw the the tail end of a large airliner plunge into the building. Of course, this is essentially what happened at the World Trade Center, both towers hit by aircraft this morning. - Oh my God, that's crazy. - Five minutes ago, 10 minutes ago. - Did they just say the Pentagon was also hit? - The Pentagon was also hit. - The west wing of the White House has been evacuated as a possible precaution as well. President Bush was not there, When this occurred he was in Sarasota, Florida, where he made this remark today. Today we had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. - You investigated the Pentagon and the White House? - Yeah, I just recorded it. - You got anything on there? - It's high quality HDTV. - I've walked on the streets. And I just figured why not take some images. - All right, okay. - What do you think? - It's just a terrible act. It's shameful, it's really disturbing And I feel for the people who are in this building as we watched the floors burn one by one. Now I'm picturing them trying to escape and run down the stairs and sort of, what's gonna happen next? We just heard that the Pentagon was hit by an airplane and... - How does that make you feel? - Awful, I have just, this pit in my stomach. - Two planes crashed into the Trade Center. A plane crashed also into the Pentagon and the White House. - They also? - Crashed into the Pentagon and the White House. - All the, crashed into them? At the same time? Oh my God. There were four planes? - They had four freaking planes. - Four freaking planes and... - It could be more down there. That's what I've heard on the radio. What about, what are the planes? Did they fell down? Fell down? - I bet they're hitting every city, the major landmarks. - There's a very serious situation underway in New York City this morning. - What are you thinking, man? - Pretty unreal. - You know about the Pentagon? - I just heard about it. So this is a little taste of the Mid-East. - What do you think they'll do though? - That's a frightening thought, with Bush in office. - We were watching people jump to their death. And my coworkers saw how it went through. We saw how it went through and we were watching people jump. To their death, one and another and another. - A co-worker saw the plane... And he thought initially that it was a missile. And then we heard that it was an airplane. And then like eight, 10 minutes later, a second one. And that's how you... And all those people above it, they're gone too. This is just the beginning. - It's a lot, we're just, like in a daze. - We are here, live outside of City Hall. The entire, as you can imagine it is absolute chaos here. The entire city has come to a standstill. Everyone just standing, looking at the smoke. Pouring out of the World Trade Center at this moment. - The Capitol and the treasury are being evacuated, this in addition to the White House and to the Pentagon. Apparently being hit by a plane this morning, like the World Trade Center twin towers. - What are you thinking? - I feel like Pearl Harbor happened again. - I did too, man. - It's just, I feel like... Speechless. - How do you feel inside? - I don't know. - And of course a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. And saw a second plane crash into the second tower of the World Trade Center. - It's not like I can call anybody. - They're sending everybody home. - What happened? - You okay? - Who do you know that was there? - Nobody, just... - The idea. - Just turn around and go home. - They sending everybody home. - I live all the way uptown. - Oh boy. - You gonna be okay? - This is horrible. - I've got a question. My brothers over at the truck. They're gonna send everybody down here, huh? - Yeah, everyone. - I tell you, man, I feel very strange. Hope my brother didn't have to go down there. - Hope not. - Oh my God! - Oh snap! - Oh shit! Oh my God! Oh my God. Oh my God. - Can I hear on your radio? Can I hear your radio? Can I listen yo your radio? You see that? It's gone. One of the towers is gone. - Please don't film me. - What's happening? - Oh my God, oh my God. - There's people so far away from home. They hit the Pentagon, that's the serious thing. I mean... - I wasn't gonna take the train. - The only superpower left in United States, left in the world, right? Let's attack it. - Unbelievable. - I heard about Pentagon. - The White House, I was told was hit too. I don't know, this is unreal. And you wonder how quickly could they have gotten those people out? Because it did happen a half hour ago or so. - They got some people out. - But on the ground, everything is... - You know what? All the buildings... I just, I see it. I can see him from here. But at least I'm not involved in anyway. - Go out of your way to get to it. Well you can, I'm talking about her. - I heard some other stuff about the Pentagon. I said goodbye. - Something else, we saw a cloud of white smoke coming up 5th Avenue. I don't know if that was... - The Pentagon also... - This is shady, shady, shady. - I heard it was too damn low. Shit hit the first building and by time I got to 54, my building, the other one went off. - You work at the center? - No, I can see it from where I'm at. On the train, I was like, why is this thing so low? - Because she's stuck on a train where a lot of people didn't come out yet. - They closed down the bridges and they closed all the tunnels and all the bridges. - Jesus, is that low. - Yeah. - It was low all right. - Are you making a movie? - Looks like it. Where were you? - I was on the train. I was on the floor and somehow I skipped over my stop at Fulton. I don't know if I didn't notice it or if the train didn't stop. And then I saw this woman crying on the uptown side and she was in the Trump center tower and she saw it. She saw the helicopter and the other plane crashed into the building. She was scared and sad. And I'm gonna go give blood somewhere. - Oh my God! - It wasn't an explosion, was it? - I mean, it's bad enough they did it but the fact that it collapsed. The fact that it collapsed, that just like taking the flag and wiping it. - Oh my God. - Did you catch it? They just bombed the mall, five minutes ago. - They just bombed where? The mall, the Washington mall and the Supreme Court. - Oh my God. The Pentagon, yeah also. - We gotta watch out. They might hit the Empire State building or something. Everything's evacuated, right? - Yeah, I mean... - Evacuated. Everything's evacuated right now. - Oh my God, I'm freaking out man. - Yeah, everything's evacuated right now. They got the, they got the Pentagon, they got the, Supreme court, the DC. - They bombed the Supreme Court? The Supreme Court, DC. Pentagon, the back, the back wing, the tail end of the plane smacked into, got pretty far into the Pentagon. And it blew up, 767, they said. That's what they sent so far. They're expecting more. - I can't, I still can't believe it. I see it. But it's very hard to believe. I mean, the Pentagon was bombed. - It was? It's unbelievable. - So they say in Chicago, was it two? What buildings? - I don't know. - I don't know, I don't know. What I am hearing, it was a car bomb of some sort. I'm not sure. - They bombed Chicago too? I mean, New York, obviously. It's right on the fucking coast. - Pentagon, Supreme court and supposedly there's eight planes were hijacked. Four of them, four or five they've accounted for. Two here and two in DC. One in Detroit or Chicago, but there's still two or three more planes that were hijacked. - Are these fuckers kidding? Who would do it? - Why? - What's gonna happen after that? But who? Where? - I saw, I was on the Manhattan Bridge when the second plane went into the building, it went directly in and exploded. - You saw it? I saw it, it was on the Manhattan bridge. Our train was. the first tower was on fire. A second, big plane, a second big, great plane. Commercial airliner came like this and straight into the side of the building and exploded, the second tower. - You saw it on TV? - No, I saw it. - He was on the train across the bridge. - It was the train on the Manhattan Bridge. We were stuck there. - How many people do you think were in that office? - My, everyone, my brother worked with. My brother's whole company's gone. He's in our LA, thank God. But I don't know what's going on in LA. They're not gonna be any stock market or anything. There's nothing. And Pentagon, there's nothing. I've been sitting here for an hour and a half. I have no idea what to fucking do. - What do we do? - I have no idea. - I can't, I wanna get out of Manhattan, but I can't go back to Brooklyn. - You can't go anywhere. - I can't get outta here. - You're stuck on the rock. This is the last place I want to be right now. - We just hairlines away from surviving right now. It's amazing, I really don't understand. - They said in, what is it? St. Vincent hospital? They had more than 200 in there already. - Yeah? - In critical condition. - You all right? - The plane came by and it looked, it looked like it was gonna hit the first building. And it looked like it intentionally tried to hit it, but it missed and it just clipped the outside of the second building. It looked like a movie. Oh, I gotta change station. - I've never shot anything like that before. What did you shoot? Did you actually get part of it coming down? - Yeah, I got the first building coming down all the way. - Where were you? I was standing about five, six blocks up. There was an explosion out of the left side and it just just kept on coming down. The worst thing I've ever seen. - How you feeling? - I'm feeling horrible right now. I don't think there's anything you can say to describe that. I mean, you know, I mean everybody, I got friends in a financial center. I wonder how many of the buildings were affected around it. You know, when I hit the, when I hit the deck, I got to believe that there's, 10,000 people dead down there. Gotta believe that. At least. - The people were hugging and crying over here in the street. Strangers were hugging and crying. That's a rare thing in New York city, having stranger talk. - There's four more planes still in the air that they don't know where they're going. - Well, I hope, I hope that what I heard was jets. - Yeah, there are F-14's. I've seen them all over the place or flying around. I mean, you can hear them and then you see them way ahead of you. - Truth. They're off, they're flying all over the place. - Ready to go. Well, you know, what are you going to do if you're, if you're like a civilian on that plane? I guess, I guess you're done, right? - You're done. You know, when you think about it, what's it, 300 people or 3000 people? - No, 40,000 people. There's 40,000 people that work there. - No, this is incredible. Walking down here, headed to the Trade Center. Taking pictures. - Where are you from? I'm in LA, I flew out here just for this show. The Jackson show. - Yeah. Coming down here, sightseeing and buildings falling down. It fell around 10:29. - How'd it make you feel, man. It's just taken all the press away from Michael. You know, they did a great show last night. Then this shit happened. - I was there, I just saw it all falling down. It was, when I got out of the subway, it was people just screaming bomb and didn't let us out. And when then we went out and we saw this huge black smoke and people were screaming and moving in the street. And suddenly the police were screaming that the building's gonna fall. That was when the first plane crashed into it. And somebody grabbed me and we ran in the street. And then I went to my building, which is across the street. And then the second building and then the second crashed and then it all just all fell down and we were trapped in the building with smoke and smog all around us. I was not in the twin towers. I was across the street. I was on Broadway, I saw it all happening. And then when the, when the first building just fell, I just was talking in the phone and people were screaming and yelling. We just like, it just fell and collapsed with huge, huge cloud. And it was horrible and, and amazing and horrible. And, and people were screaming and we evacuated the building and we were trapped because there was so much smoke. We couldn't even, we couldn't see, we couldn't breathe. They let us, they gave us rags up to 20 minutes full of water to get out of the building. And it was just so horrible. People were screaming and crying in the streets and people coming out full of dust and smoke and police officers. Do you know if there's any way out of the island? - No. There's no way? - Not right now. - No, no, no. You can't walk across the bridge. - The US emphasis on Bin Laden. And it's been Bin Laden, Bin Laden, Bin Laden said the United States is only one focus at a time. And in terms of somebody involved in terrorism, there's the intelligence community falling in love with the notion that only Bin Laden can do this. - By the grace of God, I came down from 44. Only by the grace of God. - How you feeling? - I don't know what to say. It's kind of strange. Overwhelming. - Doesn't feel real. - Yeah. Still doesn't feel real to me. - Yeah. - I was down there when it happened, the first one. I watched the plane go in. And I've just been walking around with my phone ever since. The World Trade Centers right in front of us, just... - Like a missile. - Just swooped right in. - Just like a missile, going right in. - It's unbelievable. I can't believe it. The explosion that came out was just, it was just like a mushroom cloud. - It was just, boom. - Can you believe that view? That's view is, the worst view I've seen, ever. - I was supposed to leave, moving out of Manhattan yesterday. My flight was canceled. So, there must be a reason why all this is happening. I'm a appalled. - This is like a war. - Yeah. I think more people died here today than Pearl Harbor. - I bet you're right. - Yep. - When it started to come down, people started running in the streets, back then running towards this way. Nobody knew why, it's just like crowds of people running, everybody just started running. All of a sudden, like, when we got far enough away, everybody stopped, turned back and the second building came down. There's eight hijacked planes in the air right now. Well minus the two that crashed already and another one that crashed in Pennsylvania. So they said there's five of them still in the air. - And I got my camera. I think I tried to call you guys. And I've been out walking on this street, it's so freaky. Yeah, did it blow up though? Or it's just a fire? It collapsed? Oh, shit. - What do you hear on the radio? - They're just talking about more crashes. - Where? - One plane just crashed into Camp David - Camp David? This is crazy. - Yeah. - Where else? They're talking about a plane that just crashed in Pittsburgh, but I can't hear what they're saying. - Eye witnesses say, it looked like a US airplane. And that appears to have been the modus operandi of these terrorists. That's what we saw with the World Trade center, apparently hijacked airliners flying into the twin towers this morning. Another plane reportedly headed for the Pentagon. US fighter jets are assembling to track that aircraft. As we mentioned, just a moment ago, a large plane has crashed in Western Pennsylvania. The officials at Somerset County airport outside Pittsburgh say the plane went down just North of the airport. It would be about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. - It looks like a terrorist attack. That's all I can say, I don't know. - I got stampeded on, I had things fall on top of me. I saw a guy, I feel bad for this guy. He's a big guy. he was on the floor, had blood gushing out of his head and everything was really bad. - We're not close, we continue walking this way. And then we heard, oh my God, the building is gone. So we look, and the building was gone. So we stand up into corner, I'm just looking at all the tower. And then we saw the tower just disappeared. The second tower was just gone. - Collapsed from underneath itself. - And then we just continue walking and we don't know what to do now because everything is closed. We live in New Jersey. So, just continued walking the street. - Wondering around. We don't know what to do, how to get home. - You know, you look down low, this is how you know where you are in Manhattan. And you would just look there and there would be the two blinking red antenna. And they're just not there. How you guys feeling? I'm pretty blacked out right now. - Remember the movie Siege? - Yeah. - It came out two years ago and all the islanders protest, because there was like this coordinated attack around New York. This is... It's like everybody thought that they can't shut the city down and they shut the country down because people aren't flying. Incredible. - They got the fighter jets up in the air. You got to be over here. I went down there with like 50 guys. - When? - Just now. See how far I could get. To see if they needed volunteers. They're going to need a lot of volunteers down there. - You gotta try something. - Right. So I was down there, we got down, we got down two blocks below Canal Street back to Newport and they stopped us all. He got my number and they're going to need, you know what I mean? Thousands of people are dead. - I know, I know how many firefighters and rescue people are here. - Yeah, right. - But it hit, people who were hit below the 74th floor may not have been affected because there was some people, some guy told me he managed to get out. But if people were hit maybe above the 74 floor, - They were probably targeting around 45th floor because that's the mechanical floor. They did structural damage because the plane, when I was working, the plane almost hit my crane, right over here, the plane tilted. It came about 50 feet from the plane, went straight into the building. I saw it hit the building. - Did it go to the, the surrounding areas? Like little Italy and Chinatown? - Well, there was like an implosion because the building came... The second building... - So it didn't attack that area, right? When you had a reporter on the street and I heard that was right there in the street and saw the two. And it was the FBI and the police actually saw it coming. But I saw the first one and the second one over here. - Did it affect my, I live in Little Italy. So did it... - It may not have gotten that far, but I heard all the subways and all the tunnels that I heard, somebody has a radio on ma'am. - Probably bridges or a Metro... - Everything is targeted right now. - The UN building, the federal plaza. - I mean, don't you wanna take a subway... - I was on the subway when it happened, people were telling us. You know they attacked the Chicago Sears building also. - I believe... - No, they, they evacuated that building. - If they're after the entire system, and I think they are, right? You don't know what might be next. That's the whole thing. - I'm worried about the... - Well, now we're, but now we're in, you know... - My neighborhood's okay, Little Italy. I'm gonna go down and see my dog. - I can't comprehend it. It's madness. - Most shocking thing I think I've ever seen. Or probably will ever see. - Do you know about the Pentagon and all the other places? - No. - No? The Pentagon, there was a plane crash there too. - Seriously? - Seriously. In Pennsylvania, another plane crash. - Oh my God. - There was one in Chicago. - Do they know anything about... - Yeah, Camp David, where the president hangs out. That's where they bombed. - Really? - They've also... - When we woke up this morning, we were like, we were gonna go and visit. - We had jet lag because we got here yesterday. - We were gonna go and visit the building, we were like, yeah if we had gone up a bit earlier and gone, we would have been. We were gonna go see the Statue of Liberty first, we would of been down there. If we left an hour earlier. - We were gonna be downtown even earlier this morning. - This is mad. - Can you imagine the skyline there? - Yeah, that's totally what I was saying. - New York is just a different place. I can't believe that something that big is just gone and like... I mean, I don't even know what to do. I dunno what organization sort of did it but I just can't understand. Just can't go around why anyone would wanna do it. It's honestly like a huge bit of history that we've witnessed but I wish it's a bit of history I wish that didn't have to happen anyways. It is a big thing, in a lot of ways and it's weird that we've seen it but you know, I didn't wanna see it. I didn't want anyone to see it. I just wish it hadn't happened. It shouldn't have happened, it's bad. - Do you know anything about the death toll or anything? - Those buildings hold something like, 50,000. - Did they manage to get a lot of people out though? - I don't know. - Even though we know it won't work, we tried this from on about 10 payphones and it hasn't worked. So it probably won't. - It's working. - Is it? - No. It's not working. Oh just work for me. - Borrow me another one. - I'm just kidding, this is amazing. - You can't believe it? - I'm sorry. You can't believe it, right? - I can't.. I'm in shock. - Everybody like that, man. - When that second, when those towers came down, I, I dunno, I think everybody, so many people were crying. - Okay, everybody cry you know why? Because I'm very close to my brother there. He was right there, but everything's all right. He called me a few minutes. - You talked to your brother? Yeah, no, he called me by another number on the phone. He gave me the answer on the machine. - Oh good. Everything's all right. - I'd rather smoke less than smoke a lot of smoke. - everything, you know, is that a fume, got smoke like this. The ash is through like rays. You can see it right there. - My daughter walked around there too. - She okay? - Yeah she called, she took a lot of smoke. You know, she can't see that side. - You can't see everything there. Everything is dark over there. They tell them, the TV in the report that's between 5,000 people and 10,000. Between five and 10,000 killed today I don't know. - Buddy, you all right? You all right, buddy? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Were you close to that? - Yeah, eight blocks away. - You all right? - Yeah. That was the Trade Center bombing too last time. Hopefully that doesn't mean anything else too. - How do you feel? - Fine. Just the people getting out there. It's crazy out there, man. - Do you know if any city workers were there? - We have no stats on anything yet. We know there's a lot of garbage down there, a lot of, a lot of damage. People are jumping outta windows. A lot of weird shit going on. - Do you know if we can get to the Brooklyn Bridge? I'd walk down the Manhattan bridge. Where do you wanna go? What train? - Uh, Brooklyn. - You want to take a train? Because the train services supposedly working, not here, but if you go down to Spring Street or maybe up to, what's it? 28, should be working, they said the A was working. - What's going on? You can't walk anywhere downtown here? - Yeah, that's for the FDR. - Pardon? - For the FDR to cut across. - Okay. Is this line going North? - Right now, it's been, When they decide they're moving further north, we'll talk. - Everybody's gotta move down, down past Ward Street, We're moving the line down, everybody down past Ward Street. - Is that south from here? Yes, everyone move south. Everybody down past Ward Street, past the scaffolding. - What happened to the building? - They are, from the explosion. And they have to check now for the structural soundness of the surrounding buildings that were hit by the debris. A lot of the glass windows were blown out. Some of the buildings have airplane parts in front of them. So, the big concern now is making sure that everybody got out of those buildings. - And did all your colleagues get out? - We believe so, yeah. - Where are you going? - I'm going home, I live on West 10th street. - Perfect. - Walking seems to be the best course of action right now. - I think it's the only. - Yeah. - I looked over to my left and I saw a big jet coming and I was, I couldn't believe it. I'm like, we gotta get outta here. - You could actually feel the heat from the explosion through the window. - Really? So, did you see the other plane hit? - Not the first one, the second one, yeah. Second one, we were just looking out the window when it hit. - Was it just horrifying? - Yeah, cause I mean just seeing it. And then it was like in suspended animation, you saw the jet engine and then the jet engine just like went into the building and disintegrated. It was unbelievable. - I'm feeling kind of strange right now. I'm feeling like I'm getting over it, you know, it doesn't really, I don't know. I guess it will come in waves, but it's just a bizarre, bizarre feeling. It's just so surreal, I don't think, nobody, it's like, nobody's really excited about it. It's just insane. - Just insane man, unreal, unreal. - We were watching when the second plane hit the building and it just, you know, it rammed into the backside of it and this huge explosion came out the front. - How do you feel? - I feel awful about it. I feel awful about it. I dunno what to say, much beyond that. I've always sort of thought that this country was wide open for terrorist attacks. - But this is the wake up call and it's a harsh one. - And CNN kept going on. Kept saying, one of the landmark buildings of New York. It's like, landmark buildings of New York. It's the fucking landmark building up the planet earth. I mean, come on. - It's the most famous structure in the world practically. - You could show that picture to somebody in a cartoon. They'll know it's the World Trade Center, it's in New York. - What kind of retaliation do you think that there'll be? - I don't know, it's really tricky, man. I'll tell you something. Well, I mean, there's always a lot of, sort of, a lot of people who are not particularly sympathetic with Israel. Not criticizing Israel for being too harsh, going after terrorists. And you know, but people here, it's easy to criticize. Nothing was happening here. Now when something like this happens here, we'll see what our attitude is and what our retaliation is. And it probably will be very severe and the suffering has just begun and I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of bombs and stuff going off in other countries. - You don't know where to be? - I'm telling you, I don't know where to go. - You guys, okay? - Yeah, I'm okay, thank you. - This is horrific, it's horrific. - It's like the end of the world. We don't know which way to go. - You don't know which way to go? - This was planned boy, very well planned. They won't even give you a chance to catch your breath. - They're can get hitting us left and right. We have to retaliate, we have to do something. We can't let them get away with murder. - Who is they? They, the terrorists. - That desert storm bullshit in plain English. Why didn't they do it then, that's all. Get rid of them. Oh, am I talking now? - No, I'm with you. - Okay. - I'm totally with you. You know, I just... - They better crack down. - It's just too easy to get in and now all round murder. - Everybody gets away with murder. - They gotta stop the people from coming in, that's the trouble. - We're too lenient. - We are, I think this is gonna change.. - Other countries, the security, you can't get in and around... - But yet everybody.. All the foreigners are here, there's more here than there. - Are those people foreigners or are they just different Americans? - Well, whatever you want to call them, you name them. They're not familiar to me. - Mind our own business and get out of the middle East and mind our own damn business. Worry about this country for a change. Worrying about every other damn country. Keep peace, keep peace. Meanwhile, their people don't believe in peace. - All we have to do is pray. God listens to our prayers. It seems like they end of the world, really. - This is very troubling. - Fucking no twin towers. - No twin towers. The view is like never gonna be... - Unbelievable. - You guys, you guys work around here? - We work downtown. - You work downtown? Where'd you work? - 40 Wall Street. - How close is it? - Gosh, we saw the building right out the window. We were on the 45th floor. Saw the building right out the window. - You get the fuck out? - Yeah, we went down the stairs when the second one went, - What do you think we're gonna do? - You mean punishment? I'll get all fucking wrecked and bomb everybody. That's just what I would do. - Gotta do something, we can let this happen and not do something about it. - I feel like the ground has just evaporated underneath me. Like everything is an illusion. You saw those things fall down? - Yeah. - They were like, just like nothing. Just those, huge buildings. Just like dust. - This is horrible, this is horrible. - People will divide their lives around today. You know, before the World Trade Centers came down and after. Nothing will be the same after this. I just hope there's no war as a result of this.
