She's a job and a paycheck. Just a little bit bigger on both counts, but nothing more. Let's hold stationary at 2,000 yards and do the drill. and do the drill. Holding steady. Holding steady. Barring any contingencies, this should be a cakewalk. Standard start-up. Fly her home, nice and easy. Suarez's team and the bartender, enter Airlock Number Four, initially checking on the main crew cryo-bay. Even with the reserve power, the crew should be all right. Then they proceed on to the main engine reactors. Vendler's team enters Airlock Two, proceeding to the bridge and the computer center, establishing navigational control. Any questions? How 'bout the cargo? What a surprise. When it comes to money, some things never change. Listen, sweetheart, if you can't handle it-- No, no, no. You listen. You'll have plenty of time to check on that cargo when we're flying this monster home. I got the monster you used to fly on right here. Fly this, you-- Okay, that's enough! All right. Okay. Any other questions? No one? All right, the atmosphere checks out fairly stuffy in there. Otherwise, we're in pretty good shape. Keep it in mind. We got three minutes to the first dock, which is two minutes more than your monster ever lasted. [ laughs ] All right, let's get it together. No time to waste here. Take this.

Now get out of here. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. You all right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's just that when I was ralphing upstairs, you know, I heard Vendler talking, something about you and J.T. It was kinda strange. Yeah, well, most of what Vendler says is strange. Look, it's no secret we don't like him, he doesn't like us. That's just the way it is. No, no. But this was like-- Look, whoa, whoa, whoa. We got a job to do here, all right? We don't have a lot of time to do it.

If you can make it to Airlock Four in 10 minutes, I'll do my best to pick you up. Your best? Can you do a little better than best? All right, well, you better get going. You got another 100 meters to go. Thanks anyway, Captain. Thanks anyway, Captain. Me and my big mouth. Me and my big mouth. "All the world's a stage..." Oh, Jesus, not you again. "and all the men and women..." Don't insult my intelligence. Don't insult my intelligence. "Merely players." "Merely players." "Merely players." "O pardon me..." "O pardon me..." We are one hour from charted space. Then there's going to be no hiding. "thou piece of bleeding Earth..." Maybe you and Misha can help me out. Oh, say, Rugby, you got any idea how to complete this? "O pardon me, thou piece of bleeding earth, for I am meek and gentle." Blank, blank, blank, blank, blank. Forget you. No, no, no. I think it was from Julius Caesar. That's a very good guess, my man. "Meek and gentle." "Meek and gentle." Got it. "With these butchers." [ chuckles ] If you knew computers as well as you know this shit, we would have control of the ship by now. by now. I'm almost there. I'm almost there. I'm almost there. All systems override. All systems override. Magnetic field activated. Magnetic field activated. Please enter password. Take the t-intersection ahead. I copy, but there's something funny going on down here. What? A magnetic field. It's very strong and fluctuating regularly. What's the deal? I want you to time the field fluctuation. I need to figure out when the constant magnetic field will be reached. The Agamemnon is carrying The Agamemnon is carrying 22 million tons of Solarium. 22 million tons of Solarium. I got a second and a quarter. What's up? Listen, Lennon, Solarium is highly unstable. It's transported embedded in a solid silicate that keeps it from going critical, like heavy water in an old-style nuclear reactor. Or like, say, packing TNT in sawdust. Yeah, right. A magnetic field would cause the Solarium to collapse. And? And when the magnetic field is constant, boom! We have an explosion the size of a little, tiny nova. A little, tiny nova like the sun blowing up? Ah, yeah, something in that range. How long till that happens? An hour and 10 minutes. This ship isn't the Agamemnon. It's the goddamn apocalypse. So what are we going to do? We? I'm going to get as far away from here as possible. Now get to that airlock, and I'll pick you up in three minutes. pick you up in three minutes. I bet you I make it in two. I bet you I make it in two. What's she doing now? Crazy bitch is trying Crazy bitch is trying to dock. to dock. Two seconds from docking. Two seconds from docking. Okay. I'm ready. Okay. I'm ready. Turn on the deflector Turn on the deflector shields. That should stop her. shields. That should stop her. Shit. Vendler must have seen Shit. Vendler must have seen me. Sorry, kid. me. Sorry, kid. So what's plan B, Captain? Leaving you here and saving my ass. You're not still mad about that martini or the stun gun or the jail, are you? I told you you talk too much. But I can sense you're growing attached to me. Shut up, and let me think. You know where to find me. "I am poor as Job, my lord, but..." I know it. "Poor as Job, I know it. "Poor as Job, my lord, but not as patient." my lord, but not as patient." my lord, but not as patient." Override. Override. "To be, or not to be. That is--" "A horse! A horse!

You've been sitting on it the whole time. What? My ass? No, the main reactors. You're going to shut them down. Me? You said you were a wizard. I might have overstated my abilities a little bit on that. I mean, if I screw up the sequence, we're all toast. Right? All right, then we'll go to plan C. What's that? I hightail it out of here, and you solve the problems. Any other suggestions? I think I like plan B a little better. Thought so. Shut those monsters down, shields go down, ship stops. I pick you up, and we'll be back with a posse before they know what hit them. That's a good plan. I see why you're the captain. you're the captain. And don't you forget it. And don't you forget it. And don't you forget it. Noel. Noel. Noel. Computer: Override. Override. Override. What happened? You tell me. You were out cold. Must have been a strobe-lock in the program.

Another intellectual genius. Computer: Negative helm control. "What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine." You got more? Bring it on, pal. All right, I'm in. Okay, bring the field strength down, and cut the fuel. But you must do it in perfect synchronization. And if I don't? Boom. Bye-bye, Lennon. How did I know you were going How did I know you were going to say that? to say that? Whoa. We're way past critical. I don't know how she's holding it together. holding it together. Start shutting her down. Start shutting her down. Power's faltering on Reactor One. It's not faltering. It's being shut down. We missed one of 'em. Affirmative. We've got manual override on valves one through 16, 17. Can we stop him from up here? Negative. Rugby, Mailai, go down there, and bring me back his liver. With the depressurization, we have no access to the aft sections. Damn! If this computer goes down, If this computer goes down, we're screwed. we're screwed. It's falling steadily. Everything's holding together. Containment levels? All clear. As close as can be expected. "The night is long that never finds..." that never finds..." Let the best man win. Let the best man win.

I think God's got better places to be right now. We got lucky, and luck doesn't cut it. Computer: Negative helm control. Noel! Please enter final sequence password. I just don't know.

Central cargo dock is as weak as paper, barely there at all. When the cryo-bay went, it probably took the power conduit with it. What's the access? You're not going to like this. Ventilation shaft. Bingo. You got it. Get moving. I'll meet you there. "The night is long "The night is long that never finds..." that never finds..." I want to know what's going on back there. Can we monitor basic functions? Sure. Good. Now let's see what our friend's up to. Yeah! I got it! I'm getting close. I can feel it! close. I can feel it! Look, handle this. Look, handle this.

Take the fourth shaft Take the fourth shaft to the right. to the right. God, why did I think this was going to be fun? He's in the ventilation service duct. Can we seal him in? No. The latches are all on manual mode. Then let's freeze his narrow ass. Bring down the climate control. That should control. That should slow him down. slow him down. It's getting a little cold and breezy in here. Climate controls have been reactivated in your sector. They know you're there. Well, that's great. There's a hatch ahead of you.

I'll be there any minute. I'll be showered and shaved. Vendler! You might want to take a look at this. What is it? The Salvor. What is she doing there? It looks like she's got It looks like she's got her docking apparatus out. her docking apparatus out. Here she comes. This is going to be a dock like you've never seen. That bitch is going That bitch is going for the cargo bay. for the cargo bay. Bull's-eye! Bull's-eye! Lennon, door opening. Lennon, door opening. So I guess I didn't really dress for the weather, hmm? What do you say we blow this iceberg? That's the best idea I've heard all day. They're getting away. Forget about them. We've got the cargo. Have we established helm control yet? I'm close, very close. I'm close, very close. I'm gaining on this guy. I'm gaining on this guy. "To be, or not to be--" That quote again. "that is..."

Shit! All systems failed. All systems failed. Override? What's going on here? You better hop in Station Two and get ready to relay my commands. What's wrong? Right now, the ship can't find its own asshole, let alone navigate. You run a diagnostic? Way ahead of you. Can you keep up with me? I can manage. I can manage. Don't sweat it, Captain. Don't sweat it, Captain. Vendler: What the hell's happening? Noel: I'm performing a total reboot. It's not going to take more than 15 minutes. Look, then just do it! Computer: Rebooting all systems. 15 minutes, if we're lucky. Estimated time, 15 minutes. This chick is good. Damn! We're tied into the Agamemnon's system tighter than a young girl's you-know-what. I get the picture. We're going to do a hard cut. We're going to wipe so clean, I won't even be able to fly her on manual. No communications either, so drifting is out. Well, I hope you got a plan. Not quite, but these should Not quite, but these should come in handy. come in handy. You know, the last time somebody handed me one of these, things didn't go so good. [ laughs ] Well, it's going [ laughs ] Well, it's going to be different this time. to be different this time. Have you figured it out yet? Yeah. We're about to meet our Maker. Okay, Noel, we have to get out of here. Hmm. How do you suggest we do that? There's an escape pod There's an escape pod in the front of the ship. in the front of the ship. What are you going to do about Vendler? I'll take my chances with Vendler. Look, Noel, it's between him and the Earth, and between him and the Earth, and he's a hell of a lot smaller. he's a hell of a lot smaller. Not yet. There's still time. I can beat this gal. Rebooting in progress. Please stand by. Please stand by. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, you'll see, bitch. Yeah, you'll see, bitch. Here's the kernel. It came through the status channels, God only knows how, and then branched up, down, and sideways. branched up, down, and sideways. Here it is. Here it is. "To be, or not to be--" "A horse! A horse!

Whoever wrote this didn't seem to care who saw it. She wanted somebody to see it. She wanted someone to understand. Final target, Earth. Holy Christ. This isn't a ship. It's the biggest missile outside the Hebron Comet. Everything makes sense. The engines, the field in the cargo bay, the trajectory. We're headed towards Earth with 22 million tons of unstable Solarium, with a fusion reactor to act as the primer. She'll go at about 100 miles out and scorch a quarter of the Earth. God only knows what the aftereffect will be. But we have to save it. Okay, here's what we have to do. We cross the decompressed breach and under the forward compartment. Then we go to the main computer and shut it down. Okay, how do we get back on the Salvor? Answers are given on a need-to-know basis. Well, I need to know. I don't have a clue. That, I didn't need to know. Well, saddle up, cowboy. Well, saddle up, cowboy. We're moving out. We're moving out. "O pardon me, thou piece of bleeding earth, that I am meek and gentle..." Oh, my God. It's a continuous loop. There's no way out of it. Vendler beat us to it. He pulled all the L-rings so they won't seal. Well, we could run an oxygen purge if we have a breach in the suit. Okay. That'll give us what? About three to four minutes. Well, that'll give us 30 seconds to cross the gap. No problem. I'm a bartender, you know. Final target, 39 minutes, 40 seconds. It's over, Vendler. We got to get off this ship. I'll tell you when it's over! It's over, man! It's over! You just keep working, You just keep working, damn it! damn it! Do you hear me? The number one priority is that we don't go hurtling off into space, so I hope this carbon-dioxide gadget of yours works. No reason it shouldn't. Just point it in the right direction, pop! You damn bartender. You damn bartender. Ready, now? Ready, now? Ready, now? [ console beeps ] [ console beeps ] "To be, or not to be-- "To be, or not to be-- that is..." that is..."

Noel, you stay here. Noel, you stay here. We're not going to make it. You know him that well? We were partners once. Partners? I want Wayne alive. Wounded is all right, but alive. Yeah, got you. And the other one? I don't give a damn. Rugby. Vendler and I were the best in the business. There was a biological outbreak a biological outbreak on an outlying colony, bad. on an outlying colony, bad. Still space-cold. They got to be close. Rugby, they're coming your way. The freighter carrying medical supplies locked up en route, so we got out there and started a tow. Yeah? What happened? We got stopped by hijackers. They wanted to black-market the stuff. Same destination, bigger money. What did you do? We bluffed. We told 'em if they didn't let us through, we'd blow the freighter and then no one would get the supplies. Yeah. So? They didn't believe us. They stole the supplies? No. Vendler wasn't bluffing. He blew the freighter. What about the colony? 2,000 colonists died. And Vendler, he was so proud of himself, the asshole. And believe me, he doesn't give And believe me, he doesn't give a shit about the Earth either. a shit about the Earth either. Shit. Shit. You mine now! You mine now! Damn it. Class-three armor.

In 33 minutes, I'll worry about my demise. Right now, you worry about changing the course of the ship. Listen, Vendler-- Listen to me, you punk. [ yells ] Just shoot me! Just shoot me, you son of a bitch! I will gladly come down there and gore out your eyes before it comes to that. Do you understand me? Will that hold him? For about five minutes. Then I'm going to have to put my gun down his throat. "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women..." [ sobs ] [ sobs ] Oh, I just... Oh, I just... [ laughs ] We'll cut 'em off in the cargo annex. Good call. We can take the straight shot down the corridor. If they catch up with us, it's going to be a shooting gallery.

Listen, I've been thinking about the Salvor. So have I. Maybe we could use her to blow this ship off course. Never work. Engines aren't strong enough. We could blow her up. What? Think about it. It's a small ship, and she's right at the midpoint of the Agamemnon. We'd have to blow both engines to ignite the Solarium in the front holds. Blow up my ship? It would tear this son of a bitch right in two. Engines in the rear. Solarium in the front. The engines would still go The engines would still go critical, but that's all. critical, but that's all.
