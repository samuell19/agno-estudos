Present With the participation of A film by THE TSUGUA DIARIES Day 22 Day 21 I barely slept last night. Nightmares? - Mosquitoes? - Mice? Yearnings? I don’t know... I was feeling really weird in that room. It’s a little better out here. Poor thing. We could have a party. We could use some dancing. You think so? No one will show up. C’mon! Don’t be so negative. I don’t like parties. They’re all the same. It’s just people talking to each other and nobody listens. I get bored. You don’t know how to act around other people. Look who’s talking. I’m shy. Sure you are. Sure you are. I get embarrassed around people. I have no patience for them, so they have no patience for me. You two are horrible beings. And, on top of that, you smell terrible! Look, you can see the sea from up here. - That’s not the sea. - Sure it is. I can’t see a thing. But it’s okay for sunning. The mystical droplet is about to come loose. Day 20 Eek... Come here. Gurué. Come here! Come here! Gurué, come here! Let’s go! Day 19 It’s not rotten yet... Oops... Look at that. Aim at it. Score, almost! Let’s try that one. Here. Hey! C'mon man! We could throw a party. We could use some dancing. You think so? No one will show up. Don’t be so negative. I don’t like parties. They’re all the same. It’s just people talking and nobody listens. I get bored. Don’t you know how to act around other people? I’m shy. Sure you are. I get embarrassed around others. I have no patience for people, so people have no patience for me. C’mon! Oh... I suck at this game. We could throw a party. We could use some dancing. - You think so? No one will show up. Don’t be so negative. I don’t like parties. They’re all the same. It’s people talking and nobody listens. I get bored. Don’t you know how to act around other people? I’m shy. Sure you are. I get embarrassed around people. I have no patience for them, so they have no patience for me. C’mon! Day 18 How’s it going? Good! Have you been feeling better? Yeah! Well, I hope this is what you were looking for. Hmm... Let me place this... Over here. Here. Here. Could you put that somewhere else? - Ah! Where should this go? Over there. Day 17 That’s too much. Look. No, it’s not. It’ll work later. What matters is over there. - Are you pulling it to you? No, but it’s got to be tight on this side. Hit it over there. Go, do one more. Do one more. - Here? - There. No, further over there. - Over here? - That’s it, yeah. Stretch it. - It’s not going to work. If we staple it here, it’s going to tear. Well, it might work. Let’s try it. No. Try this one. - That one is too loose. - Try the other, this one is a waste of time... But they’re the same, in terms of height. Try it now... Let me see. In the middle. - No, in the middle, down below. Yeah, that’s it. The ladder is kind of in the way. Right. Are you in the middle? I am! Keep it as wide as you can. - Wait, this one came loose. - What do you mean? Come on, hit it. You should have stapled it... Did you hit it just once? No, I think I hit it twice. Okay, then. We’ll fix it later. Hit it, João! I don’t know what do, it isn’t working. What? What’s the matter? What? Didn’t you want me to staple it? Yeah. But neatly... Look at that. Look. - What do you mean, neatly? It’s all loose. Stretch it! Loosen it, more, more. That's good because when it’s tight it’s going to look like this. Day 16 Hey, how’s it going? All good. What are you doing? Let’s take our clothes off! We should all get naked! What’s wrong with you? Stark-naked! You keep acting up. You two are really uptight. You’re taunting us. You’re overly sensitive. - You’re not right in the head. - I’m doing just fine! Day 15 Open it. Day 14 Here, put it over on this side. Turn it around. Wait a minute. Do it! Let me just see if... Wait a minute. Auch! Fuck! Dear, we started building a butterfly house today. I can’t remember whose idea it was anymore, and I don’t think it’s going to work out. The mood has been heavy since yesterday. I haven’t been thinking as much about you and I didn’t think about that song again. Okay, but I am cool. I’m calm. I’m not the one who needs to take it easy. Fuck... I can take it. But I’m only doing this for us, because we have an agreement, and I’m a professional. I’m doing this for you. I don’t give a fuck about anyone else. Come here. Gurué. Come here. Come on. Come on. Day 13 Carloto, did you go surfing on your day off? Carloto, I’m talking to you. Is it true you went surfing on your day off? - What’s it to you? - Are you kidding me? I’ve been stuck here for a month, I can’t leave, and you're selfish enough to go surfing on your day off? Knowing what’s out there? - Someone got shellfish, right? What if the shellfish were infected? Having stuff delivered is one thing, bringing things in is another. Some of us are over 60, at-risk, you really want that on your conscience? It’s really irresponsible, man! Not to mention that the whole production might have to shut down, because you went surfing. I’m sorry, I think we all agree we can’t go on like this. I think it’s clear to everyone. - Everyone? - It’s impossible! We have a scene to do together, and after this I don’t think it will be possible. You don’t think it’s possible? I don’t! I mean, we have a kissing scene together... Right now, I don’t feel safe to do it. I’m not kissing anyone! I’m not kissing anyone! - You’re not kissing anyone? That’s what I just said! And I think we all agree, I mean, there’s no point in risking... I don’t know, Crista. I think that... maybe there’s no need for that, right? We wait for two or three days, and in the meantime we perform the scenes at a distance... like the Portugal Film Commission recommends... and after those three days we’ll see if he’s showing any symptoms. I don’t think those three days are enough. Unless he is asymptomatic, they are. I’m asymptomatic. There’s no way for you to know that right now, Carloto. There’s one thing I don’t get. Those decisions aren’t yours to make. It's up to Miguel and Maureen, the directors. I’m sorry, but it wasn’t up to you to decide to go surfing either, when we had an agreement. - I am more experienced than you, and I know what I’m talking about. This is not how it's done. But this doesn’t just concern the directors. It concerns everyone. It’s about everyone’s health! No one is trying to take charge of the film. You guys disinfected everything you brought with you? How can I trust that your objects were clean? But we know that up to... This is pointless! - You really think that’s an argument you can make here, now? Carloto... maybe the surfing thing... is a bad idea. Next time you can’t... go out. You’ll stay here. Like everyone else. Crista... maybe you’re being overly dramatic... because there’s a really small chance, statistically speaking, of him having caught it. I don’t think it’s that serious. João, I liked what you said. It was to the point and you were helpful, your words were to the effect of us keeping on doing the film and we can change a thing or two, so everyone is safe. Any other suggestions? Maybe the crew have something to say about this situation? We could stay 22 feet apart from Carloto, for one. Get him his own bathroom. Postpone the kissing scene. Or rewrite it. I mean, that would be a job for you. I can do it. Do what? The kissing scene. - What? Instead of Carloto? - Instead of Carloto, sure. C’mon, let’s be real. Look, I’m with Carloto. Everything is fine by me. That’s easy for you to say, you’re not kissing him. Does anyone know if the beach was very crowded? The beach was empty and there was a pandemic of jellyfish. Velella. Listen, I really appreciated everyone’s input but it’s a bit windy right now so I think we should head inside. Let’s go then, please. - Did we cut? - Okay, let’s go. Day 12 Day 11 Carloto! You’re wearing my socks. These socks? Are you sure? Yeah. Those are my socks. I’m sorry. But I need these socks. I can really use them. I need objects so I can feel like someone else, so I can distance myself from my Carloto-self, I need stuff to distance myself... You could lend them to me, just for a few days. It would be good for the film. I get that. But I also need my socks. But community spirit is important. We’re all here for the same thing, right? I don’t think the socks have anything to do with that. They’re just socks. But I like them. Day 10 Tina! Tina? Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! That’s annoying! Tina! Tina! (in Romanian) Maybe the dog is hungry! Come here, come here Tina! Here! Come check the air filter. Here you go! Easy. Easy, I’ll give you some more. Check if there’s gas in the tank. There is, but we can fill it up some more. And is there water on the radiator? Take a look. Day 9 Places! Smiles. Look sexier! Tina is over there pissing by the magazines. Carloto, what’s the dog doing there? Go get it out of there! Get it out! Tina, get out. Tina, out. Out! Okay, let’s shoot! A cloud is passing and the sky will darken, then it clears, then it darkens again, then it clears. After that I think we’re good. Okay, I want to shoot! Okay, silence please, we’re going to shoot. - Places. - Okay, silence! Okay, we’ll set up on the cloud. Sound. There’s a chainsaw, man. Just wait, it will... Okay, man... Carloto, what’s that earing doing in your ear? Can’t you cut the chainsaw out? Take the earing out, please. - But I was wearing it in the other scene. - Take it out! Vasco, just roll sound, man! First, it’s going to get cloudy. Then, when it clears, we’ll shoot ... Okay, places! - We’re rolling! - Look sexier! - He’s still wearing the earring. - Shush! Marker! It doesn’t come off that easily. Okay, so the cloud is going to pass and I think we can hold the shot. Also, if the sky covers up, you’ll have a version that starts in the sun. If we do one in the sun and another in the shade, you'll have both. Are we rolling or not? Is the camera rolling? Then you can choose one of them to work from. Right, Miguel? Places. Look at me. Look at me, slowly. Day 8 The question is not as much whether... I think I can speak for everyone. We’re very open to the process as it was laid out, but... there’s some undefinition that leaves us a little... in a place where we can’t give as much. We don’t know what we’re shooting on the day before or on the very day... So what it comes down to, is we’re doing chores, physical work, that needs to be done in the farm and we’re kind of in an... undefined place. I think it’s like Crista is saying. It's this undefinition... that’s not helping us help you. But we’re happy. We’re finding that, overall, it’s been a good performance. Things have been happening, and they've been doing so in the succession of days that, in this film, have a reverse chronology, so that what Crista or Carloto and João do ‘today’ goes back to yesterday. So that, first we see today, then yesterday. So that it just doesn’t exist, the question of what a character will do, what their life is like, what's going on, what was wrong when they woke up, they have to solve this or that, well, not here. There’s nothing for them to solve. It goes back. It goes back and I think it fits the kind of work that you have been doing. And I think you’ve been doing it in a way that... both Maureen and me, we’re happy with. We’re proud of you. I mean, I don’t think anyone here is clinging to the idea of character, but the thing is that day after day we’re performing the same task, and with contradicting directions, to the point where, we find ourselves performing tasks that aren’t ours to perform, and I think that’s where things begin to... But what you just said, isn't that the definition of an actor’s job? Performing tasks that aren’t your everyday tasks, so... Right, but yesterday I think it went beyond an actor’s job. The creation of the characters was based on some of Mariana's ideas, so maybe she can... It’s not the character... that’s not it. Maybe she can explain it better. I think we’ve had this conversation before. But just so we can give you some guidance, if that's what you’re asking for, or what you’re missing. Our idea for creating the characters or the narrative for this film was never based on biographical information. If the character went to school, or if they worked, if they had an okay childhood, or didn’t, none of that is going to matter to us. The very sequence of events, or the events themselves during the film may not be what gives a character direction either, but rather what we capture from each of you and the idea, which is based on something Maureen suggested, as this is something that she is very interested in exploring, is capturing... those elements around which a character is built, through carrying out tasks, we could shoot and observe and work from there, capturing, maybe, something from Crista we like and building from there, the same with Carloto, the same with João, so maybe that construction has more to do with that, and less with information about the character or the narrative we could, give you, you know? But the question is you’re not letting us, and I think that’s the source of our confusion, you’re not letting Crista, João and Carloto perform those activities, you're conditioning us just being here, just doing things... Because maybe if I was the one deciding what I was going to do I would be picking up fruit instead of doing some other task. Or João, maybe he’d want to push the wheelbarrow, or... Do you agree, Maureen? Do you understand what we’re saying? I think she said yes. I do. I mean, I do. If you’re uncomfortable or unhappy with the actions we’ve been proposing, this is a collaborative work too, we’re creating new things together every day, so we can think of other things and other actions, but creating the characters’ stories, the relationship between them, a trajectory, that is not, at all, what we’re after. Day 7 João Nunes Monteiro. Carloto Cotta. Crista Alfaiate. I want to thank you for coming to this morning meeting. You are very kind. Maureen is getting another ultrasound today. I’m going with her. But the film can’t stop. So we decided that you’re going to keep it going without us. Today, you’ll be the directors. Seeing as the film is pretty open, you can film whatever you feel like. There are no restrictions. I mean, you should finish by eight thirty PM so that the crew can rest, as they are very tired because their rooms are full of mosquitoes that won’t let anyone sleep. Any questions? Crista! So, we can suggest a scene and it gets shot in the afternoon? Right. Does each of us suggest a scene or do we have to agree on a scene that the three of us will film? Work it out. What are we going to do? What? What are we going to do? Yeah. I mean... what if we think about it later? I agree. You do? I do. Check, ah, check. Wait, there’s something here. Wait a minute. We can’t sing any songs, can we? Because of the copyrights... So... we would like to communicate an important piece of information, a warning, to the population around here... There’s a plague of... There’s a plague of dicks. Bison dicks. Wholly. Wholly. Woolly. Woolly. Fuck, talk about wasting film. Day 6 Come here, come here. Fuck, the water’s freezing. We have to. There. Now we just need to scrub. Now aim here. Aim here. Here. More, more. Here, here. Aim at my hand. Aim at my hand. That’s it. At my hand. Aim it... I’m aiming at your hand. At all of your hands! Dear, today I have a toothache. It’ll pass. The animals here don’t make a lot of noise. Just the parrots. I think they’re the sonic memory of the house. They mimic sheep, car honks, tractors, mechanical diggers and old boleros. A historian could write a dissertation using these parrots. The weather’s been cold, for August, but tonight it’s really hot. Day 5 See you soon. See you soon! Good luck! Where are we going to shoot? Hey, Maureen. Miguel? Are you out of the doctor's yet? You’ve got to make it quick; we're shooting here. Really? What are you shooting? This and that. Listen, I'm out of the doctor's, yes, and I have bad news. Everything’s fine with the baby, but there’s a risk of premature birth, and, well, I can’t go on shooting like this. The doctor said that I should rest, that I have to be on my back, at least for the weekend, until I get another ultrasound. But it’s very likely that I’ll always have to... be on my back, either in bed or on the couch, so I don’t know how we’re going to be able to work like this. Hello? Miguel? Cat got your tongue? Day 4 They found a woolly mammoth. A what? The woolly mammoth. A wowee mammoth? A mammoth who had hair on his back. And they found it now? They did. Inside a dog’s stomach. Bizarre. But a dead dog, who died 14 thousand years ago. It must have been a really funny creature, right? - Yeah. - If it was able to eat mammoth. But how did the dog? Look up the image online. Mammoth, woolly mammoth. Woolly, not holy mammoth. Moly hammoth. No. Woolly mammoth. It’s a cute animal! Woolly or hairy? Woolly, woolly! Woolly. Are you sure it’s not hairy? Hairy? Is it hairy? Exactly. Woolly or hairy mammoth was the last species of mammoth that adapted to the northernmost regions of the planet. Compared to other species of Mammuthus, these animals are modest-sized, roughly the same as modern African elephants. Modest-sized... Modest-sized. Let me see the picture. Modest? This doesn’t look that modest to me. Look, just look at that! - Oh, it wasn't a mammoth. Rhinoceros? No! It wasn’t a mammoth, it was a rhinoceros. I’m sorry. It was a rhinoceros. Woolly rhinoceros. Wait a minute. Mammoths we knew about, but not woolly rhinoceroses. Woolly rhinoceros. Here it is. Right! Hey, people! People! Alright, let’s move on with this pool scene. Carloto, hose. Crista... broom. João, broom. Why do I get the broom? I don’t know, you just do. Okay, sound! Okay, silence, please, over in the kitchen! Four A over two, fifth. Marker! Action! I saw a tractor, over there on the garage, I think we could use it... in the film. - Right. But did you have a specific scene in mind? - A tractor moves... - Hmm... And then... and then we’ll see. Maybe one of them could ride the tractor. Okay. Maybe João. And do you know if he can drive it? If he can’t, maybe Carloto can... or Crista. And we could put it in the film. I’m not sure I see the point. A scene with the tractor moving... and that’s it. They move around here, in this space, right? - Yes, but... - The tractor is really beautiful. The tractor itself? It’s really beautiful. Okay. But do you have any idea where... In the middle of the... Not yet. Not just yet. Okay. That idea sounds too stupid. Do you have anything better than the tractor? Well, there’s this book by Pavese that I’m reading, rereading, that I’d read maybe 10 years ago, and that I brought here because I remembered that story, of some young people who go out to a house in Piemonte to spend a few days, in the Summer, and, well, in the story as I remembered it, it was two boys and a girl, and so I thought it made sense for me to bring that book. It turns out it’s a lot more people, but anyway... they hang around the house, doing nothing, it’s August... and they never leave, they’re always there. I don’t know, I think maybe there’s something there. We can get some ideas... Okay, we’ll read it! Those are quinces! They are. Quinces. I like quinces. - Didn’t you see it? It was orange! - No. But look, there’s some over there. There! Did you see them? - Yeah! Look at that! - Wait, wait... There are so many! Are you sure those are stars? I think they’re extra-terrestrials. No, they’re not. Yeah, yeah. I think they’re aliens. Look over there! There! Day 3 Fuck, it smells bad! It smells really bad! It's stuck there. Here, you’re going to need this. That’s not going to work. Sure it will! - Sure it will... - It will! That’s it! - That’s it! - Done. - What about the rest? Hand it over. - It’s disgusting. - It’s coming. Help me pull on it. Eeek! Watch out! I’m all dirty. - Eeeeek! - Fuck. It’s not going to be easy. Doesn’t this have, I don’t know, a valve we can remove and release some water? We can’t go in the water like this. Day 2 Thank you. Is everyone still asleep? They’re hungover! Were you drinking too? Me? Yes, but not too much. - Not too much? - Not too much. What about you? I didn’t drink too much either. I don’t need to drink a lot. I get all... You’re like me. What about Adilsa? She’s... Is she still asleep? She’s hungover, what did you expect? Here? You chop them right away? You want to chop them right away? Right after you peel them? Yeah. You peel them, then you chop... In little cubes, like this, right? No, for the fish stew I usually cut them in slices. This one’s going in like this. No problem. I usually cut them like this for the fish stew. Like this, like this. - Is this okay? - Cubes are good for cod in cream sauce. Here! Here, pretty doggie! Come here! Come here! Let’s go! Day 1 First of all, I’d like to thank everyone for your professionalism, which allowed us to prepare for the beginning of this shoot, with everyone having to test negative for Covid-19. And that allows us to be here today, beginning this shoot. Anyway, I’d like to state some of the Portugal Film Commission’s recommendations regarding attention to symptoms. Anyone with symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, coughing or trouble breathing must inform production immediately and leave the shooting location straight away, informing the National Health Service immediately. Regarding the cloths to be used for cleaning, Isabel and Adilsa know how it has to be done, but I think it’s important for everyone to be aware of it: cleaning cloths should preferably be single-use, throwaway, and differentiated by a colour code for each of the areas, according to the risk level. As follows: countertops, tables, chairs, restaurant sofas and offices, among others, blue; dining tables, food preparation areas, green; bathrooms, for the sink only, yellow; for the toilet, just the outside of the toilet, of course, red... ... presenting a negative result to a Sars-Cov test undertaken as near as possible to the date of performing their scenes, keeping isolated from then onwards, as the test only determines the subject’s condition at the exact date when it’s undertaken. That’s it, for more information you can access the following website, which is constantly being updated Alright, now I wanted to know if any of you have any questions or doubts about what was just said. I do have a question. It doesn’t exactly have to do with the Commission’s rules, but maybe it does have something to do with hygiene, I don't know. Which is about breakfast. I came in and usually the first thing I do is open the refrigerator and check out what’s there. So I opened the fridge and there was a bottle of milk. And it was half empty, so I asked what’s it going to be like, for breakfast, is there milk? Yes, there’s always milk. And where is it? It’s in the fridge. No, in there’s a glass of milk there, but it’s not milk. I drink a cup, it’s gone, and then the next one doesn’t even have milk... - Come on Vasco! - And I didn’t... Really... - Vasco! For starters, the milk wasn’t yours to begin with, it was Mariana’s, okay? And that's for 1. If it’s Mariana’s, why is it in the fridge? For 2. You shouldn’t even be addressing that, we’re talking about something else. That conversation was had previously by email. Right... And in those emails, in case you don’t remember it... What emails? Everyone was asked what they wanted for breakfast. Right, but I didn’t answer your email because it was... I wasn’t the one who sent the email, I got that email too... Asking people about breakfast? Alright. - Exactly. - I like blueberry jam with cinnamon and... That's what you wrote back? No, I didn't... What I'm saying is that there should be a basket with the basics. Milk, bread, butter, you don’t need to... People don’t need to say “I like butter". Everybody likes butter. A basket with the basics... - Did you answer the email? No. It was... Did anyone answer? I didn’t because it was stupid. Did you answer the email? Nobody did. What? Everyone’s saying they did. I’m asking you, did you answer the email? - They didn’t. - Did you?! - It’s stupid! - Did you answer?! This film was shot in lockdown regime, between August 17th and September 10th 2020 Featuring With As well as For Helena Translated by Francisca Cortesão
