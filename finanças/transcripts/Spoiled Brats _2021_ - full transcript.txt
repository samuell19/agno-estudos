NETFLIX PRESENTS [enticing music playing] [Stéphane] Monaco, known more simply as Hercules Monoecus, is an independent sovereign state. Built around its small fishing port and renowned for its local handicraft, the Monégasques have preserved the values of authenticity and simplicity. Hi, darlings. Our shopping day continues. Next stop, Gucci. Jean-Charles, I just said Gucci. There we are. Monaco, these picturesque landscapes, this community spirit, where people come together to enjoy simple pleasures, share moments of conviviality... [man] Where is he? ...and fraternity. Its young people, mindful of local traditions, balance their healthy, active lifestyles with good business sense. [taxi driver] You're five euros short. I'm five euros... You see how you taxi drivers are? That's why. And then you're all surprised. Young people are often seen in the early hours - after a long night spent working. - [car lock beeps] Where's Dad's boat? Boat? Does the door open itself? I'd like a long espresso, and a fresh guava juice with a pinch of ginger. Monaco. A charming little paradise for those who take the time to live and deny themselves nothing. [sweeping music plays] [mayor] ...has finally been authorized. With one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our beautiful region at the helm... Francis Bartek. [applause] [woman] A photo, please. Over here. - [man] Mr. Bartek? - [woman] Mr. Bartek? Thank you. You're nervous about this evening. Why would I be nervous about a birthday? Last year, Stella nearly strangled the caterer. Yes, but... the theme was white, and the idiot served rosé champagne. Indeed. When you look at it that way... Ferruccio, raise children on your own, then we'll talk. Luckily, I got out of that one. And that's very unfair. Stella has changed a lot in a year. She's matured. That's not at all what I asked for. It's awful. Just look at me! I'd never have asked for this! [indistinct chatter] Idiot hairdresser! Juan Carlos, darling! Juan Carlos! - Darling, it's horrible! - [Juan Carlos] ¿Qué pasó, cariño? Look what he's done to me. I'm disfigured. Disfigured? You look beautiful. [sobbing] It makes my cheeks look fat. It's ugly. I'm just meditating. - Give me two minutes. - Sorry, honey. Sorry. [sighs] Shit. I need to take a minute. I'm about to burn out. [upbeat music plays] [indistinct chatter] Hello, Dad, Godfather. Can I talk to you? Quickly. We have a meeting. It'll be quick. Don't worry. - I've had the idea of the century. - Again? Why is he in his socks? - I don't know. - Okay, uh... What's the worst thing about buying new shoes? - It can ruin your life. - I don't know. Your feet hurt. Your 800-euro shoes hurt your feet. During the week they take to break in, you're waddling around, you get blisters, sometimes, on your heels, your toes. A nightmare. I have the answer. Victor, if you would. WHEN THE SHOE FITS Ta-da! Huh? "When the shoe fits." I'll explain. It's a bit abstract. As you can see, I have no shoes. Why? Because Victor, here, is wearing my shoes. He'll wear them for a week to break them in. I've thought of everything. We rent a hangar with carpet. We employ people who wear the shoes for a week. Go on. Demonstration. Walk. See? He's breaking them in. Can you hear the leather? [leather squeaking] The customer comes back. "Do you have my shoes?" [laughs] "No!" "We don't have your shoes. Now they are slippers." [claps hands] Come on! Let's go! Bahamas, mojito, caïpirinha... - It's interesting. - Interesting? Exciting! Why stop there? For example, new underpants. At first, they chafe on the side. Here? Yes, me too. The same. We can develop that. Guys can wear your underpants for a week... [snaps fingers] "When the Briefs Fit." It just came to me! Also, for example, you open a window wide, you take money and you throw it like that. Won't work. You don't really see what I'm proposing here. - Dad? - Nothing to say? But, Dad, come on! The market's endless! We all have feet! In every country! Do you know anyone with no feet? No. I'll think about it. In the meantime, I have a job for you. Take these documents to Avignon. Ask for Mr. Noai. Tell him you're my son. He'll be happy to meet you. You hand it over in person. Okay? - I'm not sure. Show me. - Of course. Look. - See? - One more time. I'm not sure. Shit, it's complicated. You don't get it. Instead of the Zuckerberg of shoes, you make me a Deliveroo courier. Listen, Philippe. This business is your inheritance. You have to start learning how it works - by doing these kinds of tasks. - Okay. And I expect to see you at your sister's birthday tonight. Yes, Dad. [Victor] Mr. Philippe? Can I take these off? My feet hurt. It's the wrong size. [Philippe] Stop complaining. No kidding. You didn't walk right. If you had, they would have gone for it. - Please tell me you won't be funding him. - Of course not. Shall I remind you what we've spent on his ideas? Air-conditioned underpants. Vaping cigar. I know I spoil them. I should be stricter. They need time. They've lost their mother. Francis, she died 15 years ago. It feels like yesterday to me. And I can be tough. Take Alexandre. I told him I'll cut him off if he misses another hour of college. [moaning softly] Alex... - What time does Virginie finish class? - I don't know. Why? I have an assignment due. I wanna know how she's doing. [laughs] Oh, so my daughter does the work while you do her mother? - Mm? - [whispers] I can't be everywhere at once. You deserve a spanking for that! Wow. What is this piece of crap? You'll get your pants dirty. [chuckles] - Monaco isn't what it used to be. - No kidding. And he just parks next to me with no shame. Let's try not to scratch his hunk of junk. Did he like "When the Shoe Fits"? [Philippe] You kidding? He loved it! He said "wow." [Pierre] Let's party! ♪ Stella, ooh ♪ ♪ Stella ♪ You know, I often miss watching the sunrise over the Pampas. Grabbing my guitar with my gauchos and singing all night. But I rest my eyes on this glass of champagne and tell myself I gave up a lot when I left la tierra de mi madre, but some pleasures remain. And the greatest of all is having you in my life, Stella. - That's beautiful. - Sorry. The emotion. Ahem. [plucks guitar delicately] They are so slow. It's unbelievable. ♪ Stella ♪ ♪ Why did you leave like that? ♪ Has anyone seen a grapefruit juice? I ordered it ten minutes ago. Why don't I have it? I'm sorry, madam. Shall I write it down? It's a bit complicated. Nothing's changed here. - Matthias? What are you doing here? - My aunt asked me to lend a hand. I'm happy to see you. To serve you all night, no doubt. Your grapefruit juice, madam. Thank you. Drink up. Get all the vitamins. - Mm. - [Juan Carlos singing] - By the way, happy birthday. - Thank you. [Juan Carlos] ¿Mi amor? Arrivo. Excuse me. Do you know him? - Who is that guy? - [Stella] Just a waiter. [Matthias] Okay. Let's serve the champagne. [guitar being played] Twenty-four. Our little Stella is 24 today. Can you believe it? [gentle music playing] Remember the day she was born? [laughs] Of course you remember. [sighs] I often wonder if I'm up to the job of raising them. - What do you think? - [door opens] Does she answer? When I speak to my dead husband and tell him you've given me a raise... I think I see him smile. Hmm. I miss her so much. I can step in if you like. Step in? Meaning...? You need a new wife. You're not my type, but on balance... I'd rather marry a rich man than work for a depressed one. I'm not depressed. - Hmm. - Okay, Marguerite, has Philippe arrived? - I'll go and see. - Please do. - [footsteps recede] - I'm not depressed. Am I depressed? [dance music blaring] Oh! Okay. [all, chanting] Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! [dance music continues in distance] Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! [chanting faster] Champagne! Champagne! Champagne! [all cheer] - [man 1] Come on, Carlito! - Okay. I'm going to show you how we saber champagne in my country. - [man 2] Pop the cork! - Mi amor. Oh, you are beautiful. - [man 3] Go for it, champ! - Juan Carlos! [Juan Carlos] Okay. Please, the most important thing is that you remain immobile. ¿Vale? Immobile. Completely immobile. - Like a statue. - [woman] Go for it, Juan Carlos! - [man ]Go for it, Juan! - Pop the cork, my love! Stella, just... Shh. Sorry. What is this? [exhales softly] [indistinct chatter] [crowd groans] Vintage champagne... - Little twerp. - Did he move? - [woman] Yes, he moved! - Seriously, he moved. You moved! Immobile! ¡I-N-M-Ó-V-I-L, joder! ¡Puto! - Darling? - ¿Sí? - Dad's here. Shall we talk to him? - Dad? Yes. Sí... Ahem. Find me a waiter without Parkinson's! I'll be back. [dance music blaring] I'm listening. First of all, Francis, um... - Can I call you Francis? - No. - Dad... - [Juan Carlos] Never mind. There you go. First of all, I wanted to thank you for this party. I'm the same as you. I would do anything for Stella. El amor de mi vida. La razón de mi corazón. I don't speak Spanish. [clears throat] As you know, for some months now, Stella and I have been wondering... Mind if I clean it? Mm-mm. [gun cocks] It was my father's gun. He used it to get rid of the predators prowling near our home. As I was saying, Stella and I have been together for a while. - I wanted to ask you... - Yes? ...su mano. - [Stella chuckles] - I didn't catch that. Stella and I would like to marry. - No less! - No less. Can I ask you a question? Por favor. Do you work? Uh, at the moment, no. I don't know if you're aware there's a crisis going on. What are your plans for the future? Besides working on your swing and decimating my cellar. The initial plan is a little cruise for a few months on the Indian ocean. For our honeymoon. - Good idea. - Yes! [all chuckle] With what money? - ¿Qué dice? - With what money? No importa. The problem is, with the crisis in Argentina... This crisis is indeed... - awful. - Lo sé, muy complicado. My entire family fortune is stuck in Buenos Aires. - But in the meantime... - In any case, can't I use my share of the company and the money Mum left me? You're not seriously going to marry this guy? I'm here! [scoffs] A man who doesn't know the meaning of work. Your definition. - The one where you don't see your family. - Listen, my girl... Let me be clear. I am against this marriage. - [scoffs] - Marriage, nada! ¿Claro? You don't get it, Daddykins. What's that? I'm not asking for permission. Okay, come on. Let's go. No, Stella! Come back here! - [door slams] - Stella! - [dance music blaring] - [Stella] Everyone? Everyone, listen up! Stop the music. - [music fades out] - [man] Quiet! [Stella] Juan Carlos and I have a big announcement. We're getting married! [all cheer and applaud] [Juan Carlos] ¡Música! ¡Música, por favor! [dance music plays] [cell phone rings] - Yes, Ferruccio? - [Ferruccio] It's as I feared. He didn't go. What are you talking about? Philippe didn't go to Avignon. - He sent someone in his place. - What? I'm sending you a video now he posted an hour ago on social media. [Philippe] Hey, look! This is how we drink in Monaco. [men chanting over video] [laughter] But where is he? [Ferruccio] He rented a private jet to go to Ibiza. So don't expect him there tonight. [Philippe] Let's helicopter our dicks in the helicopter. Very good, Ferruccio. - [Guillaume] Francis! - [Marguerite] Sir! A very agitated gentleman wants to see you. Francis! Guillaume, what is it? Where is he? Your son. - Philippe? - No, Alexandre. He's ditching class, and know what else? - No! - He's screwing my wife! - [gasps] - What? And to think I accepted him at my university for you, when he'd been chucked out of everywhere else. - I paid to renovate your sports hall! - Where is he? - I'll smash his face in. - [Francis] Calm down. Let's go! Everyone naked in the pool! - Little shit! - Mr. Rombi. Nice of you to come. You're sleeping with my wife! - Tell him it's nonsense. - Wait, Alex... - Shit, Dad! - Virginie? - Clara? - Shit. You're... He's sleeping with my daughters! I'll kill you. Now, really, Guillaume! Alexandre! [Alexandre] You won't catch me! [indistinct shouting] [dance music blaring] [gasps and wheezes] [lips sputtering] [gasps] [Marguerite] Sir? - [grunts] - Sir? [constant beeping] [muffled] Sir, are you okay? Dad? [monitors beep] Dad! You gave us quite a fright! What happened? Your father had a heart attack. But he's okay. - We dissolved the clot. - Great. - How? - With nitroglycerin. - Wow, you make bombs with that. - What? I saw it in Fight Club. Take soap, distill it and you have a bomb. Great. Thank you, IMDb. A film about idiots fighting. Perfect topic. It's much deeper than that. Oh, yeah? - There's nothing deeper than the void. - [laughs] Do you have an anti-stupid pill? My brother'll eat anything anyway. No need. Although, my brother would love an old lady to screw. - You have a gerontology department? - You're ridiculous! Says the chick who turns up at the hospital in four-inch heels. - Five. - We elevate ourselves as best we can. Screw you! Violent words are weapons of the weak. [scoffs] Thank you, Gandhi. He gets up at 2:00 p.m. and gives life lessons. - [sighs] - When did you last have breakfast? And which of your seven meals is that? - The one in the middle. - That's low. Stop! He's fat. It's not his fault. Since when am I fat? "Fat" isn't an insult. - Nor is moron. - It's an observation. You're unbearable. - Stop it. - Give us a spin, disco ball. Please! - There's vomit on your shirt. - Not mine. - [Ferruccio] Kids! - What? I think your father needs rest. Yeah, sorry. We'll go, Dad. - Hang in there, Daddy. - [Philippe] Out of the way. - [Philippe] What? - [Alexandre] You reek of alcohol. - [Philippe] You reek of old lady. - [Stella] You're both morons. [exhales] [nurse] Okay. I'll be going as well. Thank you. Sorry. Do you think she'd be proud of them? Who? Who you think? [funky music plays] [engine revs] TWO MONTHS LATER [grunts] [car alarm beeps] Dad! - Dad! - Dad! Where is he? I was relaxing watching a movie, but there's no more 4G, Wi-Fi, nothing! My bank cards are blocked. All six. The cops are at Dad's office. - Dad! - Dad! - Stop yelling! - Where's Dad? - I don't know. - Guess what? - Are your cards blocked? - And your cell? - How did you know? - [both] Same here. [all] Dad! [sirens wailing] What's that? [officer] Let's go! [suspenseful music plays] [knocking on door] - Who's that for? - Wait. - [knocking] - Police! Police! - [officer] Open up! - Are you dumb or what? - [officer] We have a search warrant! - Shit. - What the hell? - Where's Dad? - [officer] Open up! - [knocking] [suspenseful music continues] What do we do? - [gun cocks] - Kids! This way! We'll go out the back. - Come on! - He has a gun! [suspenseful music continues] [Philippe] Oh, shit. [police radio squawks] What are they doing? - They're seizing it. - What? Come on. My baby. [exciting music playing] [panting] - [tires screech] - Stop! Get out! - Dad! - [Stella] He's insane! Come on, get out. Get in, kids. - In there? - Get in! - No! - [Francis] Hurry up! Get in! - Come on! - Oh, shit. - [Francis] Close the door! - [Stella] It's disgusting! - [Alexandre] Drive! - [tires squeal] [funky music playing] Perfect. Thank you. Dad, explain now or I'll lose it! I want to know, too, or I'll lose it as well! Calm down. The company's having problems. How so? Fraud squad went through our accounts. Funds have been misappropriated. What funds? - What do you mean, "funds"? - Misappropriation is... - It's fraud. - ...when you misappropriate funds. Shit, do you write for Wikipedia? We've diverted money all over the place, amounting to willful misconduct punishable under article E314-1 of the Penal Code. - I don't understand. - Our accounts are frozen. - We're broke and they wanna lock us up. - What? - My God. - They... In prison? They can't send you to prison. Send us to prison! - I've done nothing whatsoever. - Nor have I. Nor have I. Nor has anyone. So who did? I'm not sure, but Ferruccio disappeared yesterday. I thought he was like a brother to you. - Shit. - Dad, where are we going? Into hiding. Far away. - But where? - Marseille. - Marseille? - Marseille? You're not right in the head. Marseille? - Okay! - I'm freaking out! - In through the nose... - I'm freaking out! This can't be happening. What about my wedding? What do I tell Juan Carlos? You tell him nothing. From this moment, you speak to no one. Family or friends. I have to fix this before the police find us. [breathing heavily] - Breathe. - Your cell phones. - Why? - They can trace them. Even turned off. I saw that in a documentary. You have to remove the chip and battery. - Dad! - He threw them! - Okay, Stella. - What? Stella, I said all your cell phones! [Alexandre] I am stillness and serenity. [Philippe] Shit, Marseille. [car horns blaring] [woman] Get lost! [door lock clicks] [man 1] Get lost! [man 2] Shut up, bitch! Beat it! [crickets chirping] [gear shift cranks] [car door closes] Are you coming? Where are we? This is my father's house. I grew up here. [Philippe] Okay. Am I the only one freaking out? [cat mewling] - [cats snarling] - Wait for me! Wait here. I have to find the meter. - It's all a dream. I'll wake up. - [objects clatter] Shit! Shit. It's seedy as hell. It couldn't be worse. No, it could. [Francis] Does it work? Yeah. A lick of paint and it'll be good as new. Come on, I'll give you the tour. [door creaks] Ah, it doesn't work. - [flips switches] - Nor does this one. Bedrooms are upstairs. [Alexandre] Watch out. [Stella] For what? [yelps] I think there's a bedroom here. This one works! This is the bedroom. We're in luck! There are mattresses. Lucky us! Nothing but good news. - And I'm hungry. - Me, too. Let's order sushi! Yes, sushi! Sweet! Got any money? [gasps] [whimpers] [cries] [sizzling] [Francis] The secret is to soak the bread. I learned that from my dad, on the building sites. Eat that in the morning, and it'll keep you going all day. I'm not eating that. It's too greasy. Actually, it's not all that greasy. You'd rather die of hunger? - Dead, but looking hot. - Okay, kids. From now on, we have to stick together. For starters, we need to think about where to get some money. It's always about money. What about living without it for once? Mm? Aren't you tired of being exploited by the system as a slave to capitalism? No. - What are we going to do, Dad? - Something you've never done. Think? [chuckles] Go on a diet. No. Work. What? [rooster caws] [mysterious music plays] [water plinks] - [loud clang] - [all gasp] Rise and shine! Up you get. What time is it? It's 6:00 a.m. Six in the morning? Are you insane? I need eight hours. At least you got some sleep. There was a spider staring at me all night. And I'm expecting you to sort out dinner for tonight. What about you? With the police on my tail, I can't go out. It's too risky. And I've fed you all your lives. It's your turn now. - Off to work! - [Philippe groans] Up you get! Off to work. Off to work! How many times can you snooze him? I'm getting two more hours. - [pot clanging] - What did I say? Come on! [laughs] Oh! Up you get! Off to work! [upbeat music playing] [gasps] - [Philippe] Ooh. - You couldn't wait? - [farting] - Oh! No. I ate bread and oil. Outta my hands. This is so gross. [Francis] Kids, there's still some bread left! - The door! - [Stella] There is no door! No toilet paper either. [man 1] Put your safety helmet on, jerk! [man 2] Lucien, come and eat! [men shouting indistinctly] [hammer clanging] How's it going, guys? Lunch break, huh? [sighs] [indistinct chatter] Looks good. Can I taste it? Thanks. What do you want? - Nothing. A job. - Go and see the foreman, then. - Shit, you have cake! - [all] Whoa! Okay. It's all good. It's all good. The foreman's over there? [all] Whoa! Oh, cariño. How are you? Are we still on for later? Actually, that's why I'm calling. I won't be able to make it. [grunting] But we have to choose the caterer. I know, but, I won't be around for a while. - Can I have my cell phone back? - Where are you? Well, I'm in... - Marrakech, in the souk. - Marrakech? In Marrakech? My father took us on the spur of the moment to show us a... riad - he bought us as a nice surprise! - You're taking advantage! - You know? - You really have it all. You have no idea. It couldn't be more beautiful. - Hello? - [phone line beeps] Hello? Why has it stopped working? I can't hear anything. Marrakech... Qué bueno. - The battery... - You've used up my... It's not the battery, I'm out of minutes! Unbelievable! [upbeat music plays] [humming] - Pierre? - [screams] [gasps] - Oh, shit! - [whimpering] You scared me! Where have you been, man? We've been calling! Oh, la, la, la. - Smells like an all nighter! - Not at all. Stop! Listen to me. We gotta launch the project earlier than planned. Sure, but which one? - When the Shoe Fits. - Ah, yeah. - Dick grab! - Seriously? Shit. I've been thinking. We can't lose out to the Americans. We have to act now. - Yeah. - I'd like... you to front me the money. - But where do it get it? - Ask your father. [laughs] [chuckles] My father will never finance such a dumb idea. Right, okay. So all the work sessions, that was... Just an excuse to party! Shit, come on, Philou! We both know it's bullshit, and we'll end up in our parents' firms. You're right. Excuse me for aiming a bit higher. Go put your little ball in your little hole. That's it. Same to you. I'm going to make something of my life. Just keep wearing your Gipsy Kings shirts. Jerk! Nothing? Not one cent? Let's hope your sister has done better. [upbeat music plays] Who could that be? [door opens] What's all this? I have nothing to wear here. Where did you get the money? [sighs] - I'm beat. - Where'd you get the money? [faintly] I sold the watch... I didn't hear. I sold Philippe's watch. I didn't... She sold my watch? You sold my Breitling? - She's dead. - No, Philippe! Excuse me for having priorities. Right now, telling the time isn't one. No! No! No! Calm down! Calm down! Breathe. Breathe. You bought food, right? Shit, no, no, no! [groans] I'll buy food with what's left. I gave my last euro to the taxi driver. [muttering] Wanna see what it means to freak out? I'll show you! This is freaking out! We'll eat this! Stop it! Stop it! - Give them to me! - Everything's fine, now! - You're unbelievable. - Drop it! I haven't finished the recipe! - The secret is to really soak it! - No! Philippe! - Really soak it! - [Stella screams] - Delicious! - Is anyone there? Mr. Bartek? Marguerite? - My princess... - Marguerite! What are you doing here? Stella called me. I've brought bed sheets and towels. - And some clothes. - There was no need. [Marguerite] Ooh, la, la, la, la. It's worse than you described. - Matthias, let's get to work. - Absolutely not. We can't leave you in this squalor. The kids will do it. Don't clean everything. - Very funny. - Tomorrow, they will find work. Work? Don't ask that of them. They won't cope. I can bail you out. I have some cash in my savings plan. - That's so sweet of you. Thank you. - Thank you. What's a savings plan? That won't do! No, thank you. Really, I... Really. - Thank you for coming. - I'll go, then. - Yes. - I'll leave you, then, kids. Chin up! If you're interested, they need a waitress at work. - Stella, a waitress? What a joke. - [chuckles] [mocking chuckle] Here's the address. In case you wanna learn to wash dishes. This is all I have on me. Take that at least. - Out of the question. - Just to get you by. I can't accept it. I don't know what Stella said, but don't tell anyone. Okay? Come on. Rest assured, all is well. Thanks.

You're looking for work? Yes, exactly. So, obviously, I'm not completely naive. I've just waltzed in here. I won't have a company to run straight away, I'm aware of that. Which is why I would settle for a position as... - a senior manager. - What are your qualifications? Well, no. I don't have any qualifications. I'm more of an autodidact, you know? Cabrel taught himself guitar. Me, it's business. Okay, I'm starting to understand, yes. What's your expected salary? No, not at all. As it happens, I'm not... 10 to 15,000 like everyone, to live with dignity. 10 to 15,000. Noted. Mustn't be afraid of starting at the bottom. - Yes. That's very much to your credit. - Thank you. Yours, too. Okay, I think we have... - No, sorry! Very important! - Yes? Uh, a detail, but I'm going to insist. Company car: V8. Anything less gets you nowhere. What else? Yes, I'd need... to be paid off the books. - Off the books? - Yes. Because... Come closer. I'm in a little bit of trouble with the police. Nothing serious. No bodies under the patio. Mm-hmm. [whistles] - Okay. - Okay? Right, so, to sum up. - You have no experience. - No, none. No qualifications. I... No, indeed. [chuckles] You're looking for an executive role. - Senior. - Senior. And you'd like to be paid ten or 15,000 off the books. [laughs] I think that's everything. Go for it! Enter! Let me have a look. So, we have... - Ah! - Yes? Nothing. Remove "senior." You need to remove at least one zero from the salary. Then I might have something. Oh. - Is there a company car? - Oh, yes. You won't be disappointed. [upbeat music playing] [grunting and panting] [dishes clatter] Good news. The boss wants to give you a trial. Midday is all hands on deck. I'll show you. I'll show you how to set up. How much is the pay? 1,200 euros off the books. And we share the tips. - Okay. Per week? - No, per day! - [chuckles] - Ah. Let's visit the kitchens. Per day? [gasps] I don't understand why people complain so much. Hello! A ride, please. - [bicycle bell dings] - How are you? Can I give you a ride? [man] Thank you. Come on! I have a ton of clients. I don't care. Who does he think he is with his hat? Sir? Remember, the customer is always right. They order, you obey, and above all keep your mouth shut. Just like before, but reversed. Think you'll manage to fit in? - It'll be fine. - Guys, meet Stella. - She's going to be working with us. - Hi. Hello. I'm counting on you to come through. I vouched for you to my aunt. I can't lose this job. Don't worry. We're talking about dishes and cutlery. [chuckles] It's not that hard. Your locker's number 11. I'll let you change. - [sighs] - Hurry. There are fishes to gut. [groans] - And dishes to wash! - [exhales] [glass clattering] [Ferruccio] I brought you this to lift your spirits. That's kind. But what I'm putting them through, I can't. I understand. - No. - You could just taste it. No. No means no. [moans] I feel bad, but this is good. Could be worse, eh? Mm-hmm. [chuckles] [strains and grunts] Here. It's a little warm. Mm. Mm-hmm. So they're really out looking for work? - [laughs] - Yeah. What I'd give to see that. For that alone, it was worth it. You won't be bored shitless out here? I'll fix the house. I've been meaning to for a while. - I'll send you some workers. - No. I'm going to do it myself. I'm a builder. Sure you're doing this for your kids? [both laugh] Come on. [door opens distantly] - Did you hear that? - No. - Someone's in the house. - [loud bang] - Who's there? - Shh. - [door opens] - [toilet flushing] [yawning, lips smack] [sighs] Get out of here! He can't see you here. Clear off! Hi, Dad. Uh... You're not out looking for work? Is that lobster? Eh... Yes. I caught it. In the sea. You caught a lobster? Yeah. You see, Dad. Nature... provides. She provides for us. It's... [chuckles] ...beautiful, it's... [exhales] It makes me... It's powerful, it's... [sniffles] We'll learn a lot from this experience. [sighs] Lobster... Lobster... [spiritual music plays] [inhales sharply] [Alexandre chants] [patrons chatter] [cook] One breaded fish, one steak tartare... For table seven, with the salad. - What? - It's for table seven. Okay. Oh! Is this for you? - [man] I couldn't have! - This for you? Okay, who's having the salad with croutons and the fish with green on top? - [woman] Mine! - [man] Here! Jackpot, here you go. - [man 1] And the salt? - [man 2] Must be her first day. - [man 3] What about ours? - Of course! - [man 4] Can I have a decaf? - Here. [woman] Service, please! - You don't need salt. - The nerve of that one! - [man 5] A carafe of water! - Thank you. - [man 6] My pepper? - Coming! Miss, the menu! - [woman] Can someone take our order? - [man 7] We're waiting! It's been 15 minutes! [upbeat music plays] [grunting and panting] [Philippe] Something just broke loose! Sorry! Shit! I don't know what to do! [coins clatter] Not a bad start. What we're going to do is... That's for dinner. And this is to fix the house. - Alex isn't back? - No. Or rather he never left. - He hasn't been working? - No. I'm being unfair. He's made himself a hammock. [snoring] How's it going? [yelps] - Not too tired? - Oh, help... - [Alexandre] What? - Come on. Dinner's ready. I'm hungry! I've been cycling. Thank you. - Here. - Enjoy. - What about me? - No money, no pasta. - What? - No money, no pasta. [scoffs] I get it. I refuse to let myself be exploited, so I don't eat? That's it. [scoffs] Sorry, big guy. They feed us, they decide. Okay. Well done. - Know what? Screw your shitty food. - Where are you going? - To eat roots? - Yeah. Yeah, because you see, out there... - there are acorns. - No. There are berries. There are apples. You see, nature... unlike you, gives selflessly. Nature is generous. There's even lobster. Right, Dad? Enjoy. [mystical music plays] Are you okay, Alexandre? [gulps] [retches] - See? It's beautiful. - [Alexandre spits] He's giving back what nature gave him. - [Alexandre vomiting] - [chuckles] Taxi! - Taxi! - Yeah! Here I am! I'm coming. [wheels creaking] - What are you doing? - And? Are you kidding me? Stop it! "Stop it!" Hey, stop! [laughs] - Are you serious? - Go on, get lost! Do you want to race? Watch! - Come on! - You big tired bastard! We'll see who's tired! Huh? So? - You're beautiful! - [Philippe] I can't even see you! - Shall we go? - [Philippe] Homestretch! There you have it! Whoo! [growls and screams] I'm starving. Can't we go lobster fishing? I have a better idea. Help me do up the house, and you'll earn your share. Come, I'll show you. Here. Put gloves on. Whitewash is corrosive. So watch me. You take a trowel... and you mix... [Stella] Here you are. Enjoy. - [man] Miss? - [Stella] Yes! [snaps fingers and whistles] [man] Oh! I'll bring you that. Hey! Yes, sir? What's this? Steak and fries. Well, I ordered steak and fries with green beans. Green beans. It's easy. They're long, thin and green. - Can you see them? - No, indeed. I don't. There we go. Are you able to take an order in full? Is it intellectually possible in your head? I'm sorry, okay? - I'll go... - Who gives a shit if you're sorry? You're expected to be competent. - It's not difficult. - Listen, I asked them, so go and complain to the kitchen. Mind your tone. You mind your tone! You've been treating me like shit! Who does she think she is? A girl who's sick of serving jerks like you dressed like a bumpkin, that's who! Do your job. What? I'm right, aren't I? [Stella] What an asshole! What are you doing? - Lunch shift isn't over. - For me it is. Did you hear how he spoke to me? - I'm not his maid! - No, you're a princess. Wanting respect makes me a princess? That's how you used to talk. It hurts, right? I know. Right, guys? Not fun to be treated like shit by people who think they're above you. This is the other side. You've come down to our level, where you learn about life. Shit! Wake up! Open your eyes! Living here as a princess, but with no cash will be tough. He wants green beans. - Green beans. - Okay. There you go. Okay, here. Thank you. Hey, Stella, come back. [sighs] We agree, the guy's an asshole. Yeah, no kidding. What do we do to assholes? [spits loudly] [cook] Present. I think we still need a little garnish. [hacks and spits] [man] Another present. [cooks chuckle] If he wants more, I've got seconds. [man chuckles] [laughs] Hang in there, Stella! - Enjoy. - There you go! [dumb laughter] Mm. Why didn't you sell this house? Oh. - It has sentimental value. - You're sentimental? - Stir it. It'll harden. - Yes, I'm stirring it. [lighthearted music plays] [mop squeaks] Don't go too fast! You'll hurt yourself. I bet you 100 euros I leave you standing, bro. Come on! Go!

Dad's had me working all day. I'm beat. Stop complaining. It's boring. - When I was your age... - "When I was your age"? When I was your age I worked 25 hours a day, in black and white and ate bread and oil! So I am not clearing this table! Figure it out. I'm going to bed. You can go and throw up later. First, we clear! What? You make yourself vomit? [sighs] Okay, I used to make myself vomit. I haven't in a long time. When was that? Why are we talking about this now? It's not important. It's in the past. It's serious! When was it? Excuse me. Now you're interested? - Yes! - Sorry. I didn't realize. Very well. In fact, I was anorexic for a year. I lost 22 pounds. - It showed. - You didn't tell me? You have to go through your secretary. And that's when she doesn't screen our calls. Talk to me! I've always been there! You never have. For anything. - I have! - You've always been there? When I spent the night in jail? - You spent the night in jail? - I'd smoked some weed. That's not the point. You weren't there. You never have been. Philippe came to get me. What's got into you all tonight? Philippe? - Mm? - Say something! Like what, Dad? They're right. It's true. You were never there. What about when I had peritonitis? I was in the hospital for two weeks. I was in pain, frightened. You weren't there. You were in Tokyo. I don't even know why. I was working! I called daily. They said you were okay. I wasn't going to fly over... Of course not. Mom would have. [delicate music playing] Okay. I'm on trial tonight. All this is my fault. I forced you to throw up. I made you take drugs. I'm responsible for your problems. By all means, carry on, if it suits you. I have broad shoulders. Go ahead! The peritonitis. That was me. - Global warming.

Take your tuk-tuk, which is over the weight limit, - and get out of here. - That's funny. - Like that pineapple on your head. - You talking to me? Know what this pineapple is gonna do to you? Crazy shit! Really? - Really, man? - Shit! Shit, my Air Maxes. Really? Not cool. - They're Parra, too. - Yeah... Where'd you get them? - I bought them on a reseller site. - Sneakers Marseille Resell? - That's it. You know it? - Yeah. - You paid 800 euros? - Yeah, 800. It's this slow coach who bought them off me! You could've got them for 400. I just put 800 for fun. - It was the pair I needed. - What do you mean? Now I have the whole Air Max range. If I resell, I can easily get 35, 40,000 euros. Forty thousand? And you're driving a tuk-tuk? [all laugh] Yes. - You're a fool. - Sure, put it like that... No, but at the moment... - Who cares? - Wait... - You really have all of them? - Yes. - Well, had them. These are ruined. - Yeah. Let me fix that. That's nice, thanks. - The other one, too. - Shit, there's still a mark. Okay... No kidding, it doesn't work. It's blocked. Go on. Try now. Ah! It's lighting up. - Turn the tap on. - Okay. - [Alexandre] Well? - It's lukewarm. - Ah, it's heating up. It's fine. - Yes? You know about plumbing? Uh... I had a high school project. A project? What project? - Nothing. A project. - There's more to it. - Tell me. - Okay. With some buddies... we diverted the toilet waste pipe... to the principal's shower. - [chuckles] - It was one hell of a job. I spent two months studying plumbing tutorials. I was a welding pro. Can you believe it? I had to join 300 meters of pipe. I dunno if I should be impressed or devastated. Impressed, for once? [gentle music playing] Little shit. [Philippe] What's that big mosque called? [Malek] Are you serious? It's Notre-Dame de la Garde. - How'd you get the Parras? - A buddy was working at Nike. For every limited edition, they'd put one pair aside. I sold them and we cut it 50/50. Pedicabs are fine for 20 minutes, but I won't do that my whole life. It sucks. - I also have a business idea. - Oh, yeah? - What is it? - I can't tell you, but... You started, so finish! Okay, uh... What's your biggest problem? My biggest problem? Just for starters? A quick rundown? In my hood, a chick has just had a kid. She's telling everyone it's mine. But, on my mother's life, I never touched her. - No... - But there's more. The kid has red hair. - I look like a redhead to you? - No. Worst of all, she's asking for money. I politely told her to fuck off, so her cousins are after me. Okay. You done? A real problem. What? You haven't seen her cousins. A problem linked to shoes. [puffs] I'll tell you. Very simple. What's the biggest drag about new shoes? - Still no sea bream? - No. Matthias! Hey! [Matthias] Yes. - Are you asleep? - Sorry. Table 14's been waiting ten minutes. - Wake up! - Thanks. It's called "When the Shoe Fits." Huh? Isn't that crazy? Where I'm from, you'd be killed for an idea like that. No, because... You don't understand. [Laura panting] [Juan Carlos] Vale, vale. [growls] I'm feeling... I'm feeling guilty. Me, too. I've betrayed my best friend. - Will you call off the wedding? - Why? [breathing heavily] Wait. You haven't heard? [growls] - What? - My cleaning lady knows the Grimaldi's gardener, whose aunt works for the Lombardots. It seems that, at the market, this aunt met Marguerite... you know, who works for the Barteks. She just broke down in tears and told her everything. - Told her what? - They're ruined! [sighs] Excuse me. Did you say "ruined"? What does that mean? They're penniless. They've gone into hiding. The father's associate must've pulled a fast one. They say he's gone abroad. - Ferruccio? - Yes. Something like that. I saw him at the country club two days ago. You're calling off the wedding? It hasn't been easy. In an instant, I became both father and mother. I had to manage the situation as best I could. You say I could've done better. Well, yes... - You wanted for nothing. - Not money, no. We needed something else. Why did you lie to us? Why did you hide her illness? We didn't tell you to protect you. You know, Dad, sometimes I think you think we're dumb. - [Alexandre scoffs] Incapable. - Yeah. Nobodies. Little rich kids... Completely shallow... Not at all. I'm very proud of you! - Ah! - You see? You're lying again. Swear you'll stop. Dad? - [softly] I swear. - Shy, huh? I swear. - There. - Much better. [gentle music playing] - It's your turn! - Just a minute. So, Dad... why did you never remarry? For you. Was Mom your first time? I'm not going to tell you that. - You never talk about you two. - No. - Are you embarrassed? - Yes. Excellent. In that case, I'll start. My first time - was in the toilets at high school. - Agh! - You too? - Yes. - Me, too! At the back? - Of course. Philippe, where was yours? Remember Fripouille, our Labrador? No! Come on! Not Fripouille! But this one time... You're dumb... She ran away next door. It was the woman next door. Well, well. At least tell us how you met Mom. We've never heard your side. [Francis sighs] My dad and I had been called to a job in Monaco. The pad was magnificent. But nothing compared to her. She was 17. I wasn't very confident... but she noticed the Polish guy. The Bartek kid. [laughs] I ended up taking her to a fancy restaurant. I'd scrimped and saved for weeks. But she ordered so much that I couldn't pay. - [chuckles] - What did you do? I made a deal with the owner. I did his patio for free. Your mother never knew. - It's not your turn. - Ah. Here, look. - [rocks clack] - [all exclaim] - You don't even need to really pedal. - No! - It does it by itself. - All by itself? - You have to watch the battery. - [man] Hello! Taxi! - [woman] Taxi! - [man] Hey! [pleasant, light music playing] - [Francis] Have you finished? I'm waiting! - Nearly done. I'm coming. [gasps] Making progress, lazybones? Ah, actually! Matthias needs an extra kilo of mangoes for the next delivery. Okay! Thanks. ♪ I wish I could say that I'm very... ♪ The big moment! Payday! [all laugh] - Célia. - Thanks. - Yanis. - Thanks, boss. - Good job, Stella. You're getting there. - Thanks. - Matthias. - Thanks. - Marco. - Thanks. - I'm not broke anymore. - Okay. - Drinks all round. - Now you're talking! [cook] Kitchen against service! On three! One, two, three, go! - [all cheer] - Go! [all cheering] Ferruccio? I can hear you now. [Ferruccio] Juan Carlos is snooping around everywhere. It's getting dangerous. - It's gone on long enough. - I know. - If you know, then... - Let me enjoy it. All this was unexpected. - I swear. - Tell them the truth. Otherwise, it'll really cost you. - I know. - You know, but... Get off my back! - Okay, but... - How's the Claudel job going? Ooh, la, la, la. Ooh, la. Ah, here they are. [blows] Look. "Rima"? Never heard of it. They supplied my grandpa's basketball team. - They don't exist anymore. - They're cool. Like a Jordan One, but more vintage. What now? Try our luck on eBay? "Try our luck"? Are you serious? You know what? This model, we reissue it. Like the Stan Smith. Everyone wants it. It's a cult shoe. Stop with your dumbass ideas. Is your dad a millionaire or something? Ah, you're right. Let's just stick to the tuk-tuks. Let me think. I have a better idea. We take this model, reissue it and flood the market, like the Stan Smith. That's gonna crush everything. - Very funny. - What? Using my words. You used the same words. With a bit of a Marseille accent. No way. I wasn't listening. I remembered an old idea I had. You're calling it your idea? - Stop. - You're serious? You're just like Steve Jobs. - It's not your idea. - I said it. The Stan Smith thing! Are you serious? - Like Steve Jobs. - Cut it out. - You're pretending. - I've had the idea for a few weeks. [whistling] Hola. [tense music playing] Buenos días, Francis. What are you doing here? How did you find us? [clears throat] I conducted my little investigation. You know your friend Ferruccio? He should be very careful. He's very easy to follow. Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay. I understand better now. You wanted to give your children a life lesson, right? What do you want? Just imagine... that your children discover your masquerade? I'm not sure they will forgive you. Careful. Dangerous people have tried blackmail before. No. Uh, no. I don't want to blackmail you. I would never dare do such a thing. Never. Eh, Dad-in-law? I've just come to see Stella and to help you. - How much? - Why do you say that? To get out of my daughter's life. How much? - What? - It's my money you want. [gasps softly] You hurt my feelings, Francis. Thanks to me, you can get out of this unscathed. And you talk to me about money? You? Think of your children. They've suffered so much. Their mother's death. Your absence. [exhales] Don't give them another reason not to believe in anything. Hmm? [Philippe] Uphill, you increase the effort. I've built up my calves! Look. You have! Perfect timing. - Juan Carlos, what are you doing here? - ¡Mi amor! Oh, mi amor, I know everything. But I'm here now. Did we miss something? [Alexandre] I've finished up there. It works. - Juan Carlos? - In person. [laughs] Listen carefully! All your problems are solved. Todos. I've borrowed against my properties in Argentina to pay back what you owe. - Meaning? - You can go home. No way. [laughs] Our accounts? Unfrozen. Money is no longer a problem. - Is this true? - Mh-hm. Why are you staying quiet? Emotion. Wait. I'm completely lost. Is all that true? - It's as he says. - For real? [all laugh and cheer] I really like him! [Juan Carlos] Bello! Ma che bello! Dad! - We're re-rich! - Dad, we're re-rich! [Stella] We're re-rich! - I'll wait outside. - [Philippe] I smell money. - Smells like money, right? - [Alexandre] Yes! Yes! [Philippe] Champagne! Oh, no. Come on. We're not sleeping here! [Juan Carlos] Vamos, cariño. [bittersweet music plays] [Philippe] Come on, Dad. Let's go. [bittersweet music continues] [Philippe] My God, she's beautiful. My princess. They didn't hurt you? My love. [lips smack] - Cariño. - [Philippe]Your skin's so soft. We've waited so long for this. - We're gonna marry. - [Philippe] I missed her. - Come on. - Cariño. Te quiero. [dramatic music plays] They're going to be furious. But that asshole Juan Carlos is right. How can they face the world if they can't trust their father? They're stronger than you think, Francis. First-name terms? I always have done so in my head. I figured I can do it aloud now. You have to tell them. You can't let my princess marry that imbecile. They'll never forgive me. What you did was completely twisted. You've hit a brick wall. But digging beneath the surface, there's love there. They will see that one day. - I won't live forever. - Exactly. So tell them. [delicate music playing] Call the children. I want to see them. I'm going to tell them the truth. - Are you really sure about this? - Yes. [classical piano music plays] Hola. - Tell me where we're going. - [laughs] We're gonna get married. - Where are we going? - To get married. Now. Wait. No. My father, my brothers... No. Have you told them? Don't worry. That comes later. We'll have a big party. First and foremost, what matters is your heart and mine. In a moment of simplicity and authenticity. The culture of Argentina. Stella, vale. It's the best day of our lives. Come. Vale, vale. Vale. Vale. Dale, dale, dale. [cell phone rings] - Vale. - Wait. It's Dad. Leave it. We'll surprise him. - Hola, Francis. - Juan Carlos? Put Stella on. I want to talk to her. [laughs] Slight problem, Francis. We're just at city hall. What the hell are you doing there? What would you have us do at city hall? He's at city hall. They're getting married. Listen. Not like this. Listen, here! I'm telling her everything. Understand? I'm gonna tell them everything! Thank you, I'm touched. I'll pass on the message. Put my daughter on! See you tonight for the dinner. With a great celebration. It's no longer a surprise, pero... [Francis] I won't let you do it! I'm coming! - I'm leaving! - What's going on? - The emotion! - She's my daughter. I love her. I love you, too. Me too. - He told you he loved you? - Huh? - He told you he loved you? - He's over the moon. - He was having palpitations. Incredible. - [cell phone rings] Best to turn it off. There we go. He's hung up, the bastard. Philippe and Alexandre are downstairs. I'll be right there. Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry. [whispering] Shall we start? - Oh! - Hello. - Ooh! - Hello. [nonverbal grunts] As deputy mayor... I'm delighted to welcome you. [Philippe] What's going on? Your sister's about to do a very stupid thing. What stupid thing? She's getting married. Married? What, now? And so a successful marriage... starts, of course, with knowing how to communicate. But also... [grunting] ...knowing how to listen. For me, you can imagine it hasn't been easy. Luckily, my wife isn't blind. Vale. - Vale. Vale. - Keep it moving. Por favor. [Alexandre] Why do you want to stop the wedding? [Philippe] Dad, say something! Mm. Mm-hmm. [deputy mayor] Hey! So, you're marrying under the joint-property regime, correct? What? It means what's mine is yours. Yes, and vice versa. [tires squeal] [hurried music playing] Please, stand. Don't wait. Stella Bartek, born in Monaco, will you take... Kevin Lepoutre, - born in... - Kevin Lepoutre? Kevin Lepoutre? I understand the confusion. Let me clarify. My father... He had to flee the dictatorship. He was a wanted man, so we changed our name. - Simple as that. - It's not clear. Stella. Stella, are you doubting me? After everything I've done for you? For your family? For your father? Stella. Hey. Cariño... - [deputy mayor] Ah! - [hands clap] [hurried music continues] Wait! Miss Bartek... do you take Mr. Lepoutre as your husband? Just think "Del Potro." [chuckles] Yes? No? [tense music builds] No! Stella, no. Dad? You can't get married. Not to him. - Why? - He just wants your money. He sold his land in Argentina to help us. Isn't that true? - Yes. - He never sold a thing. There was no need. I don't get it. - We don't either, Dad. - We don't understand. There was no embezzlement. Our accounts were never frozen. Our assets never seized. - What? - But, Dad... We were in the house. We saw the police take my car. A setup. - It was all arranged. - By who? By me. You can't marry him. He tried to blackmail me. - He's never loved you. - Stella... It's the truth. I swear. - [grunts] - Whoa. [grunts] Will you take this man as your husband? Stella. No. Hmm. [sighs] Okay. [in Spanish accent] You know, Francis... [losing Spanish accent] You know, Francis... I may have lost your daughter, but you... - You're going to lose your children. - You swine. Swindler! [chuckles] ¡Hasta luego! I'm sorry. You really don't give a shit about us. [gentle music playing] - Why'd you do all that? - Because it was urgently necessary. You saw how you were living? You thought yourself a revolutionary. You were a lazy bum, unable to stay in school for even two months. You, throwing money away on your stupid ideas. And what's worse... I let you do it. And you, darling... you were a little nuisance, spoiled rotten. I gave in to all your whims. Ready to marry an idiot who represents all that I hate. That's how you see us? No. Not anymore. [laughs] I never wanna see you again. Forget us, Dad. [grunting] Ah. NINE MONTHS LATER [Francis groans] It's sunny. Yes, it's sunny. It depresses me, too. [sighs] From the children. Marguerite... Another rent check for the house. [sighs] What are you doing today? A site meeting in Avignon. Since when do you care? [Marguerite sighs] Today is important. I thought maybe... Okay, Marguerite! Prepare my clothes. Very good, sir. Still, we handled it well. You don't see a margin like that every day. Aren't you happy? Yes. Yes, I am. [turning signal clicking] Why have you exited? I made a mistake. Rejoin the highway. Why this way? No, I know a shortcut. It's fine. Don't worry. [upbeat acoustic music plays] For a hundred pairs, no can do. No, you need to take at least 200. - Come see who's wearing Rima! - One second. Shit, Kanye West! How did you do that? This is crazy! We're working hard! They all loved it. The French, Americans. - Gilbert Montagné said, "Wow." - Are you sure it wasn't "Where"? [laughs] Nice one. Nice one. Yes, Mr. Solaro. - If you say 200, we can talk. - Hello, everyone. All right? - [Philippe] I'd love to, but... - You okay, bro? ...then I'd have to for everyone. Stop! No smoking indoors. Come on. I can't. A hundred pairs I can't do. What a mess. I asked you to tidy up. We'll put it in your room. - What? - Of course. We've waited a month for your warehouse. I can't be everywhere. I have to finish Mrs. Renard's job. It seems you've been seeing to her finishing touches for a while. [all laugh] He wants to screw her! No, not you, Mr. Solaro. What an idiot. - Yes. - [snaps fingers[ - We start with 200 pairs? - [whispers] Two? Perfect. We'll start there. It's a small order, but it's a good start. - I brought you cake. - You made it? We'll send that to you in Belgium. I'll send an invoice. We'll validate it. A pleasure doing business with you. Great. Love you. Uh, no. Thank you. Goodbye. - That's 200 pairs! - Bravo! There you have it! What did you bring? Looks disgusting. Come on! [gentle music plays] Sorry, I think I'm completely lost. Yeah... I think so too. There are flowers in the trunk. Go on. [Philippe] Anyway, we'll work something out. [Malek] How's the restaurant coming along? [Stella] I just signed the lease. It's going really well. You're not eating for free, though. An air bubble... Hello, kids. I was in the area, so I... Happy birthday, sweetheart. [sweet, emotional music playing] The house looks good. Well... [voice breaks] Goodbye. I know someone who tried to teach his children a lesson. He got schooled himself. [Stella] Dad! Are you coming? We made bread with oil. [all] Oh! [upbeat music playing] [all cheer] Bravo!
