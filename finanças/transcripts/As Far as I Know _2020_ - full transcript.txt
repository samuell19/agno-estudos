You almost had it! You coming down? Yeap. Hi. My name is Anna, and this is my husband, Miki. Hello there. We've been married for 8 years. If all goes well, we'll soon become adoptive parents. This is the first time we are at a first-aid course for babies. We're trying our best, 'coz we're really anxious. - I am sure of that. - Right. Hi there. We are the Ravasz family. This is my husband, Tibor, I'm Renáta. I am an accountant, Tibor works in construction. Our baby's coming any minute now. In a couple of days we're going to meet him. - I've nothing to add, baby. - All right, thank you. You first. All right then. I'm Nóra. And I'm Dénes. Hi there. We both work in market research, for the same company. Married for 5 years. But we'd been working for the same company long before then. Right. So two years ago we decided to adopt a baby. We still can't believe it, but 3 days ago we were told we're getting a baby. Wow. Congratulations. A newborn then? In a month we can take her home. Yes, she's premature, but they said she was perfectly healthy. Sure she is. According to protocol a few weeks have to go by anyway, don't worry. Why don't you get ready in the meantime? - A month will seem like a breeze. - I bet. Thank you for sharing. We're happy for you. Hi. I'm Zsófi, my husband's Máté. For now, we're on the waiting list, but we wanted to come... Wakey, wakey! Oh, my God, he isn't breathing. Could you call 112, please? We started CPR. I can't believe it. It's gonna be so great. Think about it! I don't know. How great? Seriously. I am so happy for you. And you're getting a newborn! Well, we didn't count on that. You won't miss out on anything. Just the bloody part! It has its beauty, but no yoga class is gonna get you back in shape, right? I find you very sexy. Good answer! You're sticking with Hanna? Yes, Hanna. By the way, who's watching your baby? My sister. She can do it. This is your night, girl. And yours, Dénes. How are you? It's a great adventure of course. We went to a first-aid course for babies. It was quite an experience. It's still not too late to realise what a complex job parenthood is... Yeah, yeah. This is pretty complex, too. That's enough, really... No way, man, this is a milkshake ipa straight from Gothenburg. Any questions? A Gothenburg brewery? You're screwing with me. Let's make a selfie for our poor expat friend... We hate you... This one's for the woman who'd never mingle with beer-fans and who'll be a great mother. How do you know that? I just do. And we'll have another dad with a daughter, though he won't be up for boy scout stuff. How do you know you won't attend "boy scout stuff" with your daughter? Walked right into the gender trap there. I don't know. I can't imagine. After all she's a little girl. If you're so keen on the boy scout stuff, keep your fingers crossed for a boy next time. Plenty of time for that. I wouldn't be so sure. What do you mean? Are you... Well, it's not official yet, but yes, I'm pregnant again. Holy shit, man, congratulations! Man, what a day! - We'll fill the playgrounds, won't we? - That's for sure. You never said... We wanted to wait till the 2nd trimester, till yesterday. I had to share, sorry. To babies... I spoke to Máté yesterday. I don't think they're coming back. Is that final? They were getting there. 5 years, man. I never took their hesitation seriously. Okay, but he kept saying he couldn't bear it. And then there's his mother. She'll die anyway. But their kid'll be a Swedish citizen. What he always wanted. Right. Though I doubt it was his decision. I don't resent him. Three of our developers left this year alone. And they are right. I know. We should leave, too. But we won't. Sorry about before. I don't know why Kata had to bring up that we are pregnant. Don't worry about it. I think Nóra was offended. I don't think so. This was supposed to be your night. Nóra's integrity as a mother shouldn't be hurt. Her integrity as a mother? Yes, it's important. Sure. But I think Nóra's happy for you. I know. And we're happy for you both. Lóri doesn't seem to care for his new girlfriend much, does he? What do you mean? I doubt it'll last. I think it's just difficult to make her join the discussion. That's true. We'd be home by now if we'd taken a cab. The bus stop's right here, no need to waste money on a cab. We can afford it. What are you laughing at? It's funny that you're so stingy. I'll never get used to it. What have you got against me? - What? - I don't get it. The bus stop's here. You should leave your comfort zone sometimes. Look who's talking. Taking a bus is leaving your comfort zone? Whatever. It would have been a bad idea to get in a cab now anyway. What? What do you mean? Nothing... You had a little too much to drink. I know Kata hurt your feelings... She didn't! What do you mean? I'm glad she's expecting. Me too, but this was supposed to be our night. And it still is. I don't get you. - Yeah, but it's different if... - If what? Nothing. Whatever. Nóra... - Are you okay? - Oops. Sorry. It's fine. Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself? Great. Dammit. And now we'll miss our bus. I'll call a cab. I see... Ok. Thank you. No car there either. The fourth company, I don't believe this. I don't get it. What do you have against Kata expecting a baby? Is that our bus? Theoretically yes. Aren't you happy about our baby? What? Of course I am! How can you even ask that? So why are you upset that she's pregnant? Does that make our baby less interesting? Stop it. Why are you making such a fuss over it? You're drunk. And you're being a jerk. Are you telling me I'm drunk? Is that your best defense? Kata was boasting about being pregnant again. That's my problem. She didn't care about your integrity as a mother. My integrity as a mother? What the fuck? You think that's my problem? Is it yours? No. Forget it. You keep misunderstanding me. Let's talk about this elsewhere. No! I want to understand. And I want to change the subject. We are not changing the subject. Explain what you mean. You never do. Must you do this here? Tell your girlfriend to turn it down a notch, okay? I'm his wife. Whatever. You are way too loud. What do you care?! Listen, baby. This is public transportation, dammit. That's what I meant, baby. You're too loud, let's continue this elsewhere. You're really gonna obey a total stranger? I'm not, but you're being rude. I don't care. I want to talk about this here and now. And I... I want to talk about it elsewhere. Please, stop embarrassing yourself. That's your problem? That I embarrass myself? This is not how a mother should behave. Excuse me? You think it is? You think you behaved like a prospective mother all evening? I think you should really think about this. If you're ready to face what's coming. It sure as hell doesn't look like it. What are you doing? Nóra! Nóra! AS FAR AS I KNOW Hi there. Did Nóra come by? What do you mean? When? Like now. No. Why? Something wrong? No. No. We had a fight, that's all. Am I on loudspeaker? Or why can't I hear you? No. My phone has issues lately. Could you speak up, please? We had a fight, that's all. About what? You sure looked tense. I was worried about her drinking. She has to work tomorrow. I didn't catch the end. Doesn't matter. I think we're tense about the baby is all. She'll be home soon. Sure. Cook her something. That'll calm her down. Right. I'll give Lóri a call, too. Bye. Okay. Bye. Are you okay? It's pretty late. Please, don't do this. I'm sorry I went too far. I didn't mean it. Listen, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it. Please, say something. Why was your cell turned off? The battery was down. I called you a few times. Are you still mad? Would you like to talk? I'd like to sleep. Good morning. Come while it's still warm. I'm not hungry. I must sleep a little longer. I thought we'd go to work together. No. Fine. I have a focus group at 9. I'll see you at the office later, okay? At first it was weird that András wanted to buy life insurance, but I realized that he was right. So can we state that buying life insurance is manly? Yes, I think so. A real man takes care of his family and thinks in advance - even for me. This is a brilliant thought, let's note it! They're our target audience! I think it is still men who sign insurance deals. It their competence! They take care of the family and of their money. It's a man's job Hey, where are you? You should be here. Ármin's asking for you. Baby? What's wrong? I'm still at home. But why haven't you left? What's wrong? - I'm hanging up now. - Baby? What's wrong? Is the focus group still on? Are you okay? Sure, I just came out to make a call. Do you think I could sneak in? It's less awkward if I'm with you. Sure. The more you see, the faster you'll get ahead. Great. Can you tell me why your husband bought life insurance, and what that means to you? Has something happened? Okay. Last night? After we got separated? Tell me. I can't help otherwise. There's nothing to do. To do with what? Did you do something? He hurt me... Hurt you? Who? The man on the bus. It was him, I saw it... What? The guy who spoke to us on the bus? What did he do? Did he follow you? What did he do? We must go to the police. No. Come on. We must go to the police right away. No, I don't want to. Leave me alone. But... We must do something. Don't you want them to catch him? I don't want to think about it. I hate it. I hate myself. What do you mean? It's disgusting. Leave me alone. I want to worry about the baby, not this. Are you on your lunch break? Yes. I came home. To talk. Go back. You're gonna be late. - I can stay if you want me to. - No need. I'm fine. I'm glad you're here. Let's start. Today we're going to test a new product. I'd like to ask you to introduce yourselves one by one and tell me how often you use margarine for cooking. Yes? Good afternoon. We'd like to report a crime... - Together? - Yes. ID, papers. Fill these in. It doesn't work. Come in from the side. Just lift it. Take a seat over there and I'll call you to take the protocol. All right. Thank you. I don't want to be here. We'll get it done quickly. Hey. Ground floor, door seven. No, the other corridor. My wife's been attacked. How? Sexual assault? Do you know the perpetrator personally? No. But we saw him. Both of us. Were you present? No, but I'd seen him before. My wife told me it was the guy we saw on the bus. I see. When did this happen? On Tuesday. Three days ago? What took you so long? Madame, should I ask your husband to leave? No need. Look. Only very few sexual assault cases reported two days later ever get solved. It's gonna be an uphill battle. We both saw the perpetrator. Doesn't that help? Sure it does. But after two days it makes no sense for the lady to go to the doctor's. We might check your clothes for DNA-evidence. I washed them. Well, that's that then. Your face looks unharmed. Do you have bruises on your body? Well, my knee was scratched. And he tore at my hair. I think he took a bunch. That's not a lot to go with to be honest. The fact that you saw the perpetrator is the one thing we have going for us. But I won't lodge your complaint until you are positive you want me to. You don't have to. But I think they'll catch him based on the description. Are you sure, madame? Yes. Okay. I'll now lodge your complaint. When did this happen? - During the day or at night? - At night, yes. Do you know when? I don't know what time it was. Between midnight and 3 AM. Are you sure? Yes. At midnight we were together and she got home around 3 AM. You got separated? In the middle of the night? Why? No special reason. We had a little fight is all. I see. And the assault happened after that? Yes. Where? On the street. Somewhere in the outskirts of the 11th district. So is it okay if I write "the victim was sexually assaulted between midnight and three in the morning on the 18th on a street in the 11th district"? Yes. Where did the perpetrator come from? I don't know. He just stood there all of a sudden facing me. - Did he have a gun? - No. Was there penetration? Vaginal? Oral or anal? No... just the first two... Vaginal and oral? Sir, I think it's best if you leave. No, no, please, I don't want to talk about it anymore. Shall we stop then? Please... if we may. Of course. That's enough for the protocol, but later a detective will question you and then you should go into more detail, okay? Fine. That's it for now. So what's next? I think your case will be handed over to the city. That's where you'll have to go next time, but not this week. Thank you. Take the roundabout. Take the fourth exit. Take the next exit. Take the next exit. At the next option turn left. She is beautiful. A healthy little girl. We had to put her in an incubator first, but she's fine now. Thank God. We'll keep her under observation for now, but she's fit as a fiddle, don't worry. Excuse me, I had no time for lunch. It's fine. I brought you these papers to sign. You're calling her Hanna Gábor, right? Yes. And how did you like her? Very much. She looks like an angel. Isn't she a little yellow? That's to be expected. They just took her out of the incubator. Your husband sure worries a lot, honey. And that's that. I wish all our cases went so smoothly. No change in your life? So we'll leave you be and in four weeks, once the baby moved in, we'll pay the family a visit. But that's a long way away. I'm sorry, this one's out of ink. No changes then? You still have your jobs, your house, your health etc. Right? - Yes. It's all fine. - Great. Good morning. Come in. Only the lady. Thank you. I'm sorry I am her husband and I saw the perpetrator, too. So I've heard. Lieutenant László Szirtes. I called a sketch artist. You start with him while I record your wife's confession. I told you already. Excuse me? I told you guys last time what happened. So you did. But a few details in the protocol are unclear, so it's important that we go through the events of that night. Please. Shall I wait outside? It's not a good idea to be present while we take her confession, it takes longer. And the sketch artist will work with you separately to avoid undue influence. I see. My colleague will take you to the sketch artist. I overslept a little, so I'm punished... You oversleep every time. I'm on duty at the lockup. Same old shit... Can I help you? The detective told me to meet with the sketch artist. I know nothing about that. Sorry. You can wait upstairs. All right. Thanks. And what's up with you? Nothing special. We got called in... Hello. I'm here for crime scene duty. I have to report to Lieutenant Szirtes. Coming. Go to the 11th district with the lady and drive where she tells you to. Excuse me. I'm sorry the sketch artist's running late, he'll be here in an hour. And what's happening now? My wife's driven to the crime scene? Yes, it'd be crucial that she find the exact location. If we find surveillance cams, they would help a lot. I'm sorry, sir, but how do you see the case? Look. There are blind spots. You came in late, so no chance of a DNA-match. Yes, I know. And the lady was under the influence and you had had a fight. None of that helps with her judgment. I don't understand. I suggest we hope for the sketches and that your wife find the crime scene. Without a perpetrator there's no case I'm afraid. Excuse me sir, but is there any new information in the confession? You'd better ask your wife. I can't tell you anything. The sketch artist will be here in an hour. Tell me when to stop, madame. I don't know. It was so dark. Shall I keep driving out of the city or should we make another circle? I don't know. Still nothing familiar? No... The two sketches weren't alike at all. But they were. How come we remember him so differently? Are you sure it was him? I am. Maybe the artist screwed up. You think my sketch was close? Yes. I don't think yours was. So we're gonna fight about that now? No. I think we should leave it alone. What? The whole thing. They won't take me seriously, don't you see? Why? You think they think you made it all up? How do I know? They won't believe me. It's humiliating. The detective thinks I'm an idiot. Even the officer looks down on me. I'm sure it doesn't help that you can't find the crime scene It's not my fault. Are you holding that against me? It was dark. All I'm saying is it makes the police's job harder... - Give me something! - Fuck off! - Than take this! - I don't believe it! He's wasted. My parents. From Naples? Hi there! Hey. So it's working! Of course it is. Are you alone at such an hour? No, just a moment. Hello, we can't see anything. - What happened? - I didn't do anything. - You pressed a button. - I didn't. Just a moment. So here we are. Hi there! Hi there. Are you okay, Nóri? You seem so pale. I'm tired, that's all. How are you? How is Naples? Quite an experience. For sure. So many people on motorbikes. They all look like gangsters. Come on! This is part of the culture. How about you? How is the baby? We have a photo. I'm sending it over. How? Can you do that? Sure. Can you see? Yeah. We got something. How cute. But a little skinny, no? Why is she so yellow? Or is it just the photo? It's normal. It happens in the first few days. When can we see her? Not for a few weeks. She is more beautiful in real life, you'll see. We'll love her like our own. Are you at the hotel now? Yes, this is the only place with wifi. Where's Nóri gone? To the toilet. All right, Dénes, we'll now go to get some dinner. Sure. Have fun. - We'll call you later. - Okay, by now. Bye, darling, kiss Nóra for me. All right, I will. Bye. Fucking A! I'm posting it as a story. Are you staying? I had enough for today. Then let's go grab that beer. We said today? We did. Can't you come? Fuck it. I'm coming. Let's do it. I can't believe you went to the dentist's before going to the pub with us. It's really not fair to us. Leave me alone with your emotional blackmail. I had an appointment. Why did we plan this for today? I have no problem with him not drinking. Of course you do. Plus, let me tell you with lidocaine you're allowed to drink. Thanks, I don't wanna get sick. But he's right. Only antibiotics are a no-no. How about that? Come on, have a drink. Fine, you won't leave me alone anyway. Give me a double IPA. Can I get another Hermelin cheese? You may. I'd love one, too. Sorry, we only have one left. Fine. Give it to him then. I'll have a herring. - You sure? - Sure I'm sure. And I only just got here. He's being doing this since we got here. What? Stop giggling. It's for her benefit. You'd never have offered me the last hermelin if she wasn't there. Sure I would have. Take it easy. What's up with the baby? When's she moving in? Not for another three weeks. We 're getting ready for her. Nóra was really happy about it. She was really radiant. Yeah. She's really happy about the baby. Cool. Not many girls would do this, I'm telling you. You should appreciate her. How do you mean? I mean most girls would want to give birth. Maybe she doesn't. I don't get what you're driving at. Was I being a jerk? Yes. Let's change the subject. We don't have to. Just tell him why you think he was a jerk. Me? Shouldn't he tell us? Hey, let's forget it okay. I stepped on your toes, I'm an asshole, sorry. How exactly did you step on my toes? Come on. I told you I was sorry. Sorry for what? Well, I guess because you can't have children. Where the hell do you get this from? Is that what you think, too? Aren't you the reason...? No! There is no proof. I function just fine, if you must know. My sperm formation is just fine and my sperm count is within the normal range! The only other problem could be varicose testicles, which I never had. And it's not like Nóra is necessarily barren. It's just the two of us together. Okay then... What made you think it was me? Did Nóra tell you or what? What? Of course not. Then where did you get the idea? I don't know, man. It was just... You looked more like it I guess... That's just fucking great. Okay, maybe that sounded stupid just then. Very stupid. But at least now we know. And then the parent tells the child that he can enter the room without fear. And the child tries to grow up and forget that there is such a thing as irrational fear. And he prepares himself for Life. Sorry, it's too late for shit like that. My cab's here, I'm hauling ass. Sorry. See ya. Talk to ya. So here is an exciting task. Imagine that the Volkswagen comes through the door. What kind of person do you think he'd be? German, I think. And blonde... or brown maybe. Like Sigmar Solbach. He's the one who comes to mind, he played in the Guldenburgs. I see. I think you can trust him. The way he looks. A good guy in a woodcutter's shirt who throws the stub out the car window. Because he can afford it. But for sure he doesn't stop. Oh, boy. I hope the next group will be easier. I don't get why they call them electric cars anyway. Isn't it like they run on gas, too, but they have an electric engine or something? Shit. Oh, shit, that's on me. Sorry. Thanks. You have really nice hands. I do indoor climbing. Really? I've wanted to try that for a long time. Why don't I bring you some real coffee from downstairs? No, no, don't worry about it. It's no problem. I need to pick up the next group anyway. No cream, no sugar, right? Thanks. Yes, black. Putting sugar in coffee is a sacrilege, I hope you know. Aye-aye, sir. Hi. Hi. Sorry. I was bored. I would have fixed it. It's fine. I enjoy doing it. And I had time. Did the police call? No. I don't think they will. What do you think? Do you think she'll like it? Why don't you look at me? I don't want to... Okay. Baby... I'm sorry... Bonbon! Bonbon! Nóra! Nóra... Wake up. Nóra! What's wrong? Why aren't you asleep? I found him. I found the guy. Who? The man. That bastard. Why are you dressed? I found him. The moron took the same bus and I followed him home. I know his address. You understand? I caught him. But... You didn't speak to him, did you? Of course not. He didn't even see me. I just wanted to have his address. What's wrong? I don't want to meet him. But don't you want him punished? I can't believe you followed him home. That's not you. I thought you'd appreciate it. Why do you care so much? I want to forget it, but you won't let me. Why can't we focus on our little girl? Dénes, we'll have a daughter. I know, but now he'll be charged and it's over, don't you get it? We'll have it over with for good. That's never gonna happen. Good night. We're done. Ready to go, Nóra. What's going to happen now? You'll be confronted with the suspect. And you'll both tell us what happened. So he is in there? No, I can't do it. It's standard procedure. Don't worry. We can't go on without it. Don't worry. It'll be fine. The detective will be there with you. I don't want to. What am I supposed to say? What should I say? - What do you mean? - What if he denies it? Come on. They know it was him. We both identified him. Follow your logic. I'll be with you the whole time. And your husband will be waiting here. OK? Sit down, please. Now. There's a discrepancy between the confessions of the two parties, which is why we are doing this confrontation. As I told Mr. Czibor, we're going to go through what happened with both of you. When we ask you a question, address your answer to the other party, okay? Do you know the suspect sitting across from you? Yes. Do you know the plaintiff sitting across from you? Yes. Now I'd like to ask you to tell us what happened on the night of June 18th. Who would like to start? - Do I have to describe exactly...? - Yes. - Can I go first? - Of course. Okay. So I was travelling home from my night shift on the last bus. The lady got on the bus with her husband, they had a fight and she got off. And then I got off as usual... Listen. Why are you doing this? You need to ask your questions through me. I'm sorry. The whole thing is just so outrageous. We both know you wanted it, too. Excuse me? You're ashamed because you're married. But why do you have to ruin me, too? What? Why do you let him say things like that? How can you? Please, calm down. Let's stick to the protocol then. Mr. Czibor, please don't provoke the plaintiff. We'll ask the questions and you'll answer them. OK, but please understand I'm a high school teacher. - You're killing me with this. - Please. So I'm going to ask questions and you'll answer them one after the other, ok? So what happened? Nóra, you may start. Well, I was walking on the street and he followed me and attacked me. Not true. We did it behind the bar. - Let's allow each other to finish. - What?? We understand you went into a bar to have a drink. Is that true? Yes. I was upset for another reason... Yes, because of your husband. So you met at the bar, correct? And earlier on the bus. And you talked at the bar, correct? A little. So what happened next? Like I said. I was walking on the street and he followed me for a long time. Again, not true. We did it behind the bar. Decent or not, we both wanted it. What? Don't you try and tell me you didn't want it at all. You know it, I know it, so what's this about? How can he say things like that? Why do you let him? Arrest him! Calm down, Nóra. I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, really. But it's crucial that you think it over what happened that night. That's all. Sometimes we see things that transpired earlier in a different light. So what we need to understand is how it started out between you two. Did you leave the bar together with Mr. Czibor? I don't recall. Nice, she doesn't recall. Did you experience joy during the intercourse perhaps? Okay, I'm not doing this. Nóra, please sit down. Nóra, please. Please! What happened? Sweety... Why did we have to come here? I knew this would happen. - That what would happen? - I want to be alone. Where's he going? To get his things. And then? You won't let him go, will you? I can't answer that right now. What happened in there? It didn't go the way I expected. What's wrong? I don't understand. My wife is completely freaked out. I can't help her any more. I'm sorry. Look... I think it's time you talked to your wife. I really think so. I'm sorry I have to go. - What the fuck was that? - What do you think?! The detective said we should talk. About what? He says it didn't go well. That man's lying. And they believe him. But we know it was him. That was never the question. He says it was consensual. What? Why would he say that? What else could he say? I've had enough of the police. Let's go, please. I can't believe this. This isn't fair. - Did you know he was a teacher? - What? A high school teacher. This man. It's not fair that he's allowed to teach teenagers. My husband often knows better, too, what's best for me. Excuse me, but a woman knows that herself. Yes, maybe, but I still think in some situations men have to think ahead. First, I found it strange, too, that he wanted life insurance, but then I realised he was right... - Hi. - Hi. What's wrong? I... Uhm... I don't know what to say... I'm so terribly sorry. And Nóra is such an incredibly strong woman. I just wanted to know that I am on her side. What are you talking about, Lili? Did Nóra say something to you? I just read the post. It's horrible the way the police treated her. This whole thing she had to go through is unbelievable. ON THE NIGHT OF THE 18TH I WAS RAPED. THE POLICE WON'T HELP. THEY BELIEVE THE RAPIST RATHER THAN THE VICTIM. I'm sorry. I'll prepare the room in just a minute. That's not why I'm here. Look, it's none of my business. I just wanted to say let me know if you need a few days off. Oh, no, thanks. Okay, but if you do, let me know, ok? I have to calculate with that. We have very important customers this month. I get it, but we didn't count on Nóra being away, either and it's hard to replace her. I understand. You could have told us she wasn't gonna come in again. She took time off for the baby anyway. But not so much. Communication, you understand? One day you called in that you wouldn't come in before the afternoon. That's not the way to do it. And your results aren't the same you know. This is a premium company with premium customers who expect premium service. And you're very far from that now. I'll pull myself together... There are many gifted people here. Why shouldn't I promote one of them to chief data analyst, if you can't do it? You understand my situation? I do. Of that, I am glad. Other than that, I'm sorry. Truly. You'll beat this. The afternoon group's about to start. We're about to play a fantasy game: How could you replace plastic in your everyday life? Right off the bat, by replacing plastic bags by textile ones... I'M NOT AFRAID TO NAME HIM. HE IS PÉTER CZIBOR, A HISTORY TEACHER IN A HIGH SCHOOL. I'm sorry it was totally spontaneous. I mean I wrote it before, but I didn't know if I'd share it. But why did you have to post it? Now everybody knows. It's for the better. You're not going to achieve anything with that! You think? Almost two hundred people shared it within an hour. And all the messages of support I got! My phone's been ringing like crazy. Still, you should have left this to the police. And you named him! I can hardly hear you. Speak up. You should have left this to the police! The police were doing jack! You know it. We'll talk about it tonight, okay? Okay, but... All right. Let's talk about it tonight. - Hello... - Hi, mum, I can't talk now. What's all this? Would you care to explain? I really can't talk now. I'm working. You think it is okay that we should find out this way? I'm sorry. Speak up, I can't hear you. I said I'm sorry! We are sorry, too, that you had to go through this, but it's your private affair. It's nobody else's business. What was Nóra thinking publicising it like that? This is a nightmare! Disgusting! Mum, please, that's not the point. Sure, whatever Nóri thinks is always the point. But there are other people in your life, son. Haven't you thought about how embarrassing this is for us? For me, too, mum. Have you thought about that? I'm sorry? I gotta go... I can't hear you. I gotta go. I'm hanging up. Wow, that's some tough shit. I think you did a really good thing. Hats off. - Thank you. - Not at all. Everything you told me was very useful. - Hello. - Lóri stopped by. Hi, honey. You could have told me. I could have helped. We didn't want to go to court. You could have had legal representation the whole time. You'd be much better off. It's too late to do anything... Lóri has some really good ideas, just listen. We should have involved him sooner. What they did to Nóra is really tough. It was entrapment, pure and simple. What do you mean? Why do you think they arranged that confrontation? Because the confessions contradicted each other. So what? If the police were prejudicial, Nóra wasn't treated equally. I'm not sure they were prejudicial. But they were! I told you. Okay, listen. I'm sorry but I don't have the brains for this right now. It's been like that all day. I can't take any more calls. Guys, if we want to move forward, we should find out where the case stands. They let him go. I told you. But that's not an official statement. I doubt there's any legal recourse left for us. Do you want to leave it at that? No, Lóri, actually I'm the one who doesn't want to leave it at that. I'm the one who found the guy. I know. But the problem with that is that he can later say you invaded his privacy. Who? Czibor? Of course. I'm not even sure the police should have used the info you provided. Which makes our situation worse. But I'll check it out. No need. We shouldn't turn this whole thing into a legal hassle. It's too late for that now. Now that Nóra made it public, there's no telling what he's gonna do. And if we can't prove force, he might report you for slander. Well... maybe you shouldn't have posted about it. I take full responsibility for that. I am aware what such a post means. But if I don't speak up, no one will ever know the truth. Why has the truth suddenly become so important to you? You didn't even want to go the police. Are you with me or not? I just don't get it. I had no idea he was a school teacher who could hurt others. Not to interfere, but you really need to get on the same side of this, Dénes. If you wanna move forward. Listen, you don't see the whole board in this, okay? Don't tell me I'm not on my wife's side. It sure seems that way. Must you do that now? In front of Lóri? No need to feel embarrassed in front of me, man, come on, we're friends. It's a really cool thing Nóra took upon herself. She's being really brave. Should you run into legal troubles, I'm here to help. The point is that Nóra spoke up where few people would have. Why did you say you came by? I saw the post and I'm trying to help. And I think we're going to need it. Okay. You know what? I'm in, whatever you decide, I'm in. But right now I'm beat. Feel free to drink the rest of my wine, Lóri and talk about what you wanna do. But I can't do it right now, sorry. Hi... Hey, wait up. What do you want from me? They fired me yesterday. A few hours after your wife's post I got suspended. You wanna sue? Sue? With what funds, man? Look at me. So why are you here? Are you trying to threaten me? You know what happened next? My ex-wife called me, she wants full custody. You know what that means? I'd never see my son again. I don't know what to say to that. Look, I didn't rape your wife. I'm sorry she cheated on you. I'm ashamed of that, believe me... Hi, Dénes. Look, we got wasted. We weren't thinking. But this thing right now will ruin me. I don't know why she's doing it, but she sure as hell is ruining my life. No, it was rape. That's what she says. And I believe her... She was drunk, wasted. But she wanted it bad. You think I'd have come here, if I didn't think it was necessary? Please, help me. Talk to her. Make her stop. I beg of you. I can't lose my kid. Do you understand? Do you have kids? No. You see, that's why you don't get it. This is a real mean thing to do. Then let's go to court. I went to the police, I was questioned. But this is not the way, man, you understand? Please, talk to her... I didn't mean to intrude. I hope you can help. Hey, you there? We're in trouble. At least I think we are. Why? What's wrong? I got a call from the foundation. They wanna pay us another visit. And do a psych eval and other stuff. What am I to do now? Hold on. The foundation? Yes, they saw the post and they were shocked. And their shrink says they need to re-evaluate. That bloody post. I regret it now. I told you it wasn't a very good idea. They're visit us this afternoon. She said she wasn't supposed to tell. What do you expect of me? Hi. We got the official letter. What? The official letter's come. And? They closed the case. What? Completely? Justification: the discrepancy between the contradicting confessions couldn't be dissolved during the confrontation. The plaintiff admitted to being intoxicated and upset due to the fight she had had with her husband. The suspect claims to have met the plaintiff at a bar. They had drinks before the intercourse, a fact that was confirmed by the bar's surveillance cameras. Footage shows the plaintiff and the suspect leaving the bar in a good mood, one after the other. Based on the confessions and the evidence there is no proof of a crime having been committed. The Budapest Police are therefore closing this investigation. - That's it? - Isn't that enough? - Can I look at it? - What for? You're right. I don't know. This is really bad timing. The foundation people can be here any minute. They need to sense harmony. Harmony? Are you kidding me? I don't want to lose Hanna. She's ours. Why didn't you tell me you had drinks with him? Are you nuts? Of course I didn't! That's what it says right here. I went into a bar and had a vodka with club soda. Alone. Not with him. And why didn't you say that before? What do I know? I told the police. It's in my confession. So why are they saying you had drinks together? He followed me to the bar and came to my table saying he had paid for my drink. He was pushy. And you accepted. I couldn't refuse it, the moron had already paid the bill! And did you talk? A little. I turned him down gently. Why are you interrogating me? Because I feel duped. That man raped me! And nothing will change that! - Did you give him any signs? - What? I don't understand this letter. You went into the bar together, you drank together... I don't get it. I just don't. I don't get it. Calm down. What is it that you don't get? You never said you went into a bar or that you met him that you had drinks, never told me any of this! You never share anything with me. What? What am I supposed to share? Do you really want to hear the details? Is that what you want to talk about? The things he did to me? What did he do to you? What? Do you even know?! Or are you just talking without a clue of what really happened?! What the hell is wrong with you? Are you nuts? What are you doing?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is that really the best time to behave that way? Now? I'll pick it up, I'm sorry... What's wrong? Do you wanna tell me what's wrong? How come you didn't tell me any of this? You are hiding something. What are you hiding? Nothing. We'll talk about it later, okay? I didn't want to talk about it, because it is really hard to. But we can't do this now. Stop it, okay? Calm down. All right. Come here... Shit, they are here. Must we do that now? It's on purpose that they don't give you an exact time. Let's find an excuse to send them away. And what would that achieve? We need to reassure them. Wipe your face. Calm down. It's gonna be fine. - Good afternoon. - Thank you. Still a very pretty flat. Thank you very much. We worked on it a lot. We can tell. And thankfully, you have the taste for it, too. Can I offer you something? A glass of water, please. I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee, I'm about to fall asleep. Please, make us coffee, dear. An espresso? That's perfect. With four sugars, please. We are truly sorry about what happened to you, Nóra. Our young psychologist colleague here thought we should talk it over briefly. But please, don't worry, we all want the same thing. That the baby ends up with the best family. That's why we are here. You had a trauma recently, and that might influence your fitness as a parent. We hope that won't be the case here, but we still have to make sure. I completely understand. Thank you. All we want is for you to answer a few questions. Let's have a chat. - Both of us? - Of course. Separately. Is there another room where we could withdraw? It'd be best to talk behind closed doors. Well, the baby room perhaps. Yes, that's perfect... So let's start with you, Nóra, okay? Can I have some more sugar? It tastes a little sour. It's a blonde roast. But I'll get you more sugar. It's gonna be fine. Your wife's a brave woman, she deserves the baby. Especially after what she's been through. Terrible. But now we have it all behind us. They closed the case. How come? They couldn't prove force, so they closed the case. Shameless. Poor woman. I hope you're spoiling her rotten. That's what she needs now! Come on in. I'll only ask you a couple of questions, there's no need to worry. Did Nóra do well? I have a positive impression of her. But now I'd like to hear what you think. About Nóra? Tell me first how you're doing. This can't be easy for you, either. Well... I don't know. I never thought about that. And now that I'm asking you? I'm fine. I'm a little worried about Nóra. Would you care to elaborate? It's hard to elaborate. Please. Your opinion carries weight. It's important. I think I'm worried about her behaviour. She can be pretty unpredictable. I see. I mean it's hard to keep up with her mood swings. What are the signs? She's often tired and in a bad mood. And she often rejects me. She withholds things or forgets them, I'm not sure. Often I have no idea what she's thinking of. She talks a lot about the baby for sure, but somehow I find it strange. Why? It doesn't matter. Nothing matters more. Please, finish your thought. Look, whatever our final decision, what you're telling me now stays between us. You can be honest. Well, she says the baby's really important for her, which I get but in the present situation... Perhaps she won't admit it, even to herself, but I can tell that she's not ready at all. Based on your account she seems pretty unstable. Absolutely. She's very unstable. That's the right word. Unstable and unpredictable. I'm sorry. Yes. Me too. We'll call you next week. All right. Thanks. Good bye. I think it went well. What do you think? We'll see. Let's go buy that pram. Nice. Is it really your first time? I'm a natural. Accept it. Don't worry. You've done really well so far. I think it's enough for today. Okay. Feel free to let go of the rope. Listen, are you really leaving the firm? I can never stay in the same place for long. I'm thinking about that, too. Really? I took you for the root-setting kind. Oh, no, not at all. I've long wanted a change. And where will you go? Abroad, I think. To do my own projects. Anything specific? Well... There might be a job in Sweden. Gothenburg. But what's your own project? Oh, I have several. I'm getting them sorted. Where are you headed? Do you want me to drop you off somewhere? That'd be great. I was about to call a cab. No need. Great. I'll change, shower and I'll see you outside. Okay. Thanks. Hi. What happened? Where've you been? Sorry, the climbing took longer. What's wrong? - Come here. You have to come here. - Where? I'm at that baby outlet. How long will it take you? Hurry. I don't understand. What are you doing there? I told you we should get the pram. Many times! But we never went. Did you go out there on your own? Why? Come here. Please. Leave now. I'm behind the store. Okay. I'll be there in half an hour. Calm down. And how would you have carried this home if I hadn't come? The way I came. With a cab. I don't get you. I'd have come with you. You've promised that before. Okay, now I'm here. Let's go. That's not why I called you. This tower looks familiar. I saw it that night. That night? I'm not sure, but I should get closer. But I don't dare to do it alone. Closer to...? To take a look in the area. That's where I was I think. Did it happen there or not? I'm telling you I don't know, But I think so. Yes or no? What's your problem? Mine? Did I get a cab to drive out to the outskirts for a pram without a word? For a pram? In a cab? You wouldn't pick up. So? You go ahead and drive out here? And get fixated on a TV tower? You can't trust your gut in your state of mind. It's not my gut. It looks familiar. I've seen it before! Nóra! You are not well. No, I'm not! Not at all. But do you even care? Do you even care what's going on with me? You weren't on my side in this whole thing! I had to do it all alone! But now I need you! I can't go there alone, do you get it? I wasn't on your side? I never felt you were! I supported you from day one! I found him! Stop repeating that! It's boring! Really? So why don't you tell me finally what happened that night. It's still not clear to me. And I'm not that slow! What do you want to hear? That I had a drink with him? That it felt good to have someone to talk to after you told me to go to hell? How much did you drink with him? Two rounds. Is that what you want to hear? Does it matter? I knew you were lying! I knew it! You wouldn't have understood. What? That you wanted him? I wanted nothing from him. I hate myself for having those drinks, but I didn't want anything. We were talking. That's all. To a stranger. Congratulations! Are you surprised they won't believe you? Do you think you are ready to be a mother after this? Let me tell you: you're not! So that's what you think. It's obvious. But you won't admit it, even to yourself. Why isn't the foundation calling? Let's stop right there. Really. Look at me. Look at me! Did you tell her anything about me? I don't know what I said. Let's not talk about it. Do you recall every word you said? No... It's just... I don't know what's wrong. Why they're not calling. Calm down. I'll be a good mother. Even if you don't believe me. I believe you. Take me to that tower. Wait. Stop. Now? Stop. This is it. It must be it. That's where it happened. But. Are you sure this time? I don't know. Not entirely. Honey... I'm not sure that would help. Let's tell the police. They might be able to do something. But the case is closed. Please. Let's let them know at least. I doubt it'll help. Police. Hi. I'm Dénes Gábor, I'd like to talk to Detective Szirtes. He is on holiday this week. What is this regarding? Hallo? Are you still there? Welcome. This is the Stork Bag Foundation. Please, hold the line... Hello! I'm Dénes Gábor. My wife and I are waiting for a little girl called Hanna. You paid us a visit about two weeks ago with a psychologist. Can you hear me? Yes. I know. I haven't called you yet, I'm sorry. All these cases you know. But I hate to bring bad news. I've been fearing this call to be honest. I should have called, but... I don't understand, your wife looked so great, I never would have thought there'd be a problem. I see. You know, at this stage it's out of my hands. The psychologist evaluates you, and I have to follow her recommendation, that's it. And since she's made up her mind, I'm afraid we can't give you the baby. Hallo? Are you there? Yes. Is there anything we can do? Could we sit down with her again? Oh, come on, that's not how it works, you know that. I understand, but the circumstances have changed. I mean our case with the police is on the right track now. It wasn't the case. Wait, let me find the file, I don't understand, either. Where is it? Here... It says here "The parties cannot present the parental harmony necessary for child-rearing..." And then... It doesn't even mention the rape. Well, that wasn't very helpful. - What did you tell the psychologist? - I don't know. I don't recall. I'm so sorry, I didn't call. I'm really ashamed. Is your wife there? Can you give her the phone? Uhm. We're not together right now. Well, I can call her tonight. I'll try and collect my thoughts until then. Poor thing. It's hardest for her. All right. Thank you. I'm gonna hang up now. Who was it? Any news from the foundation? Oh, no. Just Lóri. I forgot we agreed on a stag night tonight, but no matter. Go ahead. No way. I'm staying with you. No, really. Go. I'd like to be alone for a while. Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for coming in. I'm Detective Bottlik. Lieutenant Szirtes used to work our case. Yes, I took it over, since we had to reopen the case. So. I'll get right to the point. You did well to call us. The location helped a lot. I took a look around and I haven't found any surveillance cams outside, but an office building had their own footage of that night, and even though you cannot see the incident, but the bunch of hair we found and the recording will suffice as poof of force. I can show you the footage if you wish. But you don't have to. Yes. We'd like to see it. All right then. Just a moment. I'm sorry, this doesn't always work. Here we go... I think this is strong evidence. Enough to charge him. - Thank you. - No, I thank you for your persistence. Oh, and I heard you found the suspect's address. This is exemplary, really. Yes. And the Gulyás family will take the Roma kid, I managed to persuade them. Okay. Excuse me. Here we are. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Gizella Páll. Can you tell me your name? Nóra Gábor. Dénes Gábor. Can you tell us in a few words why you'd like to adopt a child? How long have you known each other? Sure. We've been married for six years and we are also co-workers. We both work for a market-research company with a strong portfolio. We have realised that our relationship is ready for a new family member, and we opted for adoption. First we went to a foundation, but the process seemed a little complicated, which is why we would prefer to collaborate with you. We are glad you chose us. And you? We've known each other forever and we've been a couple for a long time, too. We feel our relationship has stood the test of time...
