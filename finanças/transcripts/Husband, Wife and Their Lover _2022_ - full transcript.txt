Ballard. From our family to yours for over a hundred years. Welcome to 10 years ago, Dad. Baby steps. Are you still upset that I wouldn't approve your single mother spot? I just think it's time to expand a little bit. Well, good old-fashioned family values. Are the backbone of Ballard. Yes, I know, Dad. Mm-hmm. It should be all set for the meeting. Yes. Thank you. Bye. - Veronica. - Yes, Dad? I was just talking to Donna, or rather, Donna was talking to me. And... maybe you're right. About what? Loosening things up. So you wanna do the single mother spot after all? Oh. No. Donna thinks that you should start doing more press and social media, you know, give the brand a younger but still very traditional feel. But I did tell her I don't want this to come at the cost of you giving me a grandchild. I told you, Jordan and I are gonna try next year. You're already 30. I can still be a mom and a boss or... boss's daughter. But... I will do all the social media and press you want. All right, then. Back to work. I'm glad you had a good day, honey. Thank you for keeping my spot warm, Cody. I'm happy for you. You deserve it. Although I... do feel like you have an unfair advantage, being that you're the only one not afraid of your dad. Oh, come on, that's not fair. I'm very afraid of my dad. How was your day? Oh, you know, just like any other day as a junior high school teacher... Drama, terror, insanity. - Ah. Those kids. - Oh, speaking of kids, Dad brought it up again. You didtell him that we're enjoying our last year of freedom, right? Mm, he wouldn't really grasp that concept. He thinks we should've had kids a long time ago. Well, if we had kids when we first started dating... I would've been disowned, and you would be castrated. Oh. Speaking of our last year of freedom... Mm-hmm? I was thinking... Never mind. Never mind. No, what? Come on. I hate when you do this. - Come on. - Okay. Well... What do you think about, uh... branching out a little? What specifically do you have in mind? Well, like living on the edge. I mean, don't you remember that forbidden danger of our first time? Yes, having sex at my all-girl private school? - Mm-hmm. - During school hours? That was hot. So you wanna go back to my high school? Oh, no, no, no. More like, uh... - Uh... - Uh, what? Uh... ooh... A ménage à trois. Oh. Um... you mean me and another girl? Well, um... Yeah. Yeah. That's, uh... That's what I would prefer. Well, I bet you would. It was just an idea. Just an idea. You know, since I am turning 30 tomorrow, tell me. Mmhmm. What's it like? - Devastating. - Oh. It's like my youth just disappeared when I turned the big 3-0. Funny. I mean, isn't it forbidden enough that you're married to an older woman? Oh, yes. Living on the edge. All right. Night, honey. Good night. Wow, I don't know what to say. That's crazy, right? I mean, it's unexpected, but it's not uncommon. - Really? - Yeah. I know a lot of people who have tried a third. Yeah, well, that's because you're so free-spirited, Lexi. So you don't think I should be worried? About what? About Jordan asking for a threesome. No. I actually think it speaks a lot to how much he trusts you as a person. I mean, it does take a lot to open up about stuff like that. I've been training you for years now, and you've never said anything to make me think that you can'ttrust him. Guess you're right. And you've been together for what, since you were teenagers, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you haven't hide the time to, you know, So... - So you're for it. - I don't know. I'm just... not against it. Maybe I'll offer it to him for his birthday. Hmm. Yeah, I like it, but just make sure it's not someone you know together. - It could get a little awkward. - Yeah, that makes sense. Ooh, maybe you should pick someone only you know. I mean, you don't want a rando walking in your house, and like I said, you're a little famous, so... - That's a good point. - Yeah. Lexi... Yeah? What about you? What about me? Jordan doesn't know you, and you don't work at the office, so he can't run into you at any work function, and you're sexy. Would it be weird after? I mean... I don't wanna lose you as a client. I don't think so, and you don't seem like the type of person that would be fazed by it. Some of our stretches are... rather intimate. Plus we've already seen each other naked in the locker room. True. Are you interested? I just can't believe that you of all people, this rated G, would do something so NC-17. It's so... antithetical to your whole persona. Although for some, those really are just masks hiding what lurks beneath, which apparently in your case, is a sex fiend. Okay, it would only be one night, Gillian. Oh. The most appealing part of it all is that it flies in the face of my good girl image. - Ballard poster girl. - Exactly. So it's kind of exciting to break out of my father's mold. Well... sounds like your little sex-capade might have some liberating therapeutic value. I give my blessing. You nervous? Yes. Are you? Completely. - Lexi. - Oh. - Hey. - Hey. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. So do you. Please. So, Lexi, this is Jordan, my husband. Jordan, this is Lexi Wolf. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. - So what's good here? - Yeah. So, yeah, and people would tease me for it. They used to say that I had a silver cereal spoon in my mouth. And they're probably just jealous. But, Lexi, what about you? I've never asked you about your childhood. Mm. It's so normal. It'd bore you to tears. But I saw you in your interview on TV the other day. Mnh-mnh. And she's gonna be on all the Ballard family commercials soon. See, I told you you're a celebrity. Oh, my gosh. Okay, guys. Stop. It's so embarrassing. Can we please talk about something else? So... why did you become a trainer? So I could meet Veronica. I'm kidding, obviously. No, actually, I initially, um, studied to become an actress. I realized it was such a long shot, so I dedicated myself to training. I... love the human body. It was a fun night. Yeah. You still into it? Well, there was chemistry, wasn't there? Definitely. I think it'll be something fun for us to look back on one day. So are we gonna do it? Let's do it. Yeah? I think we should have a safe word. What do you mean? Like a word we use in case we wanna stop for whatever reason. Um, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. How about... "taffy"? That seems like a really funny word to say when you're naked. Hey, if it was too common, we might say it accidentally. Okay. Good point. "Taffy" it is. She's here. Okay, uh, do you want some taffy? You... You wanna stop? Oh, I just wanna make sure you're still into this. Well, you've come this far. And I don't wanna be rude and have her come all this way for nothing. Leave it to you to bring good manners in a situation like this. I love you. I love you, too. Hi. Come on in. Cute dog. What's his name? Cody. I love your dress. Oh. Thanks. I haven't worn it in years. Nice house. Uh, yeah, we just, uh, did a remodel. Uh... let me get us some refreshments. You have two different color eyes. Yeah. Heterochromia. It's... one of my many unique qualities. How come I didn't notice before? You've never been this close before. Hey there. Hey. I can't believe we did that. Right. Well... did you enjoy it? We both did. And you're okay with it? Yeah. Yeah. Although I... I feel a little, um... shame? That's a... That's just the Catholicism talking. - Hello! - Hi. Mwah. Oh. Thanks for coming. Of course. - Oh, let me order my... - Oh, no. Already coming. Oh, why, thank you. So... how'd it go? Well... Oh, no. Was it horrible? No. The act itself was, um... Hot? Sexy? Mm-hmm. I know. Oh. Thank you. - Anything else? - No, we're good. Oh, but you're notgood. You're bad. But... But what? Maybe it was a mistake? What? Like, for your marriage? I don't know. Like I'm gonna regret it. Veronica, I think you're just being really hard on yourself. Okay? Remember, this was supposed to be a liberating experience. You're right. Of course I am. What's wrong? Nothing. Do you feel like we shouldn't have done it? Gillian said I shouldn't feel that way. You talk to Gillian about this but not me? She's objective. She... She wasn't there. It's more than that. I-I can tell. - Did you enjoy it? - Is that a trick question? Trying to set me up to be the bad guy? No. Never mind. I can tell you enjoyed it. Look... Not because I don't love you. All right, or because I want it to be a regular thing. I know. So... We good? Yeah. Of course we are. I am so sorry I'm late. No worries. Here you go. Bicep curls. Give me 10. Wasn't that hot? Um... yeah, I... suppose it was. So you wanna do it again? What? Um... thank you, but no. Why not? Because it was always just supposed to be a one-time thing. Why just one time? What's gotten into you? Well, does that... Do you regret it? Why are you acting like this? Acting like what? Like I'm not just a little pawn that you can move around in your life however you see fit without even thinking for a second how it might affect me? Lexi. It's just so weird. For as long as I've been training with her, she's never acted like this. It's like she's just become a different person. - I'll get it. - Okay. - Lexi? - Hey. I... I was just in the neighborhood, and I figured I'd stop by. It smells good. - What are you cooking? - Uh... Can I join? No. Listen, Lexi, after what happened today, I think... Oh. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry. I let my emotions get the better of me. I just... wanted to come by and... talk to you about maybe lending me $5,000? Hey. What's going on? I got this. No. You can't borrow $5,000. Well, why not? I don't have to give you a reason. It's really strange that you're just coming in here out of nowhere asking for money. But we're friends. We're more than friends. And you have so much money. Why are you being so selfish? All right, that's enough. So you need to leave. And you're obviously fired. You don't mean that. I do. But... you promised. That was before what happened at the gym today. Veronica, there's many sides of me. Many sides. You'll see. Clearly, she's disturbed. It was so unsettling. What do I do? You could report her at the gym. I mean, coming over to your place like that definitely crossed professional boundaries. Obviously, I was the one who crossed professional boundaries first. I invited her over to... V., you can't change the past. Is that the best advice you've got for me? I'm sorry. This is a little out of my wheelhouse. I... I've never come across a psycho trainer situation before. Well... that makes two of us. Dad? Well... look who's here. I'll just get right to it. We have decided... that you are going to be the new face of Ballard Brands. What? And Donna says that market research shows that people like young faces more than older ones, so... S-Starting when? Right away. Our next commercial shoot is in a few days. That's so soon. Oh, with the metrics, we're so going in this direction. Your Instagram following is growing. That's an Instagram that I don't even personally post on. This was inevitable. You are the future of the brand. You're smart, young, modern, still family-friendly. You're the whole package. I just... wasn't prepared for the future to... be now. We never are. Congratulations. Okay. So... What do you think? Donna... it's... it's a lot. It's a good thing, right? Right. You don't seem excited. I'm just... feeling vulnerable. I wasn't prepared to be so... out there. I have every confidence you will rise to the occasion. Do you think he'll let me move the brand in a more progressive direction? Mm... not while he's alive. Oops! Did I say that out loud? But seriously, I've worked with him since before you were born, and it's a losing battle on that front. Yes, he is... set in his ways. Mm, he is a petrified forest. He will not sway. So we'll just keep it on tradition. Understood. Just think big picture, hmm? Trust me. You'll be running the whole company one day. And then you can do with it what you want. That's the plan. It is. And speaking of plan... um... you and Jordan should think about having a baby sooner than later. You know how cute a baby will look in our cereal commercials. We are gonna start trying next year. Good. It'll be a good look for you guys. A good look. Right. Can I ask you something? Sure. Did you ever resent me? Why? Did you ever fantasize about running the company? It's Ballard FamilyBrands, darling. Yes, but you've worked so hard for so long. Oh, and I plan to retire even harder. Besides, I'm a behind-the-scenes type of person, you know? And you know what they say. The hire up you go, the bigger the target on your back. I'm just not built for that type of pressure. I'm not as strong as you. Here to kick some butt? Lexi. What are you doing here? I'm late. I know. I'm sorry. I told you. You're not my trainer anymore. I fired you. I... I thought that that was a misunderstanding. You promised me that this wouldn't happen. Are you gonna keep your promises? I'm sorry if I misled you, but... You're just gonna throw me away like garbage, huh? Like garbage?! Keep your voice down. I don't wanna make a scene. Well, it's too late for that, Little Miss Perfect! This is a scene, and you're not the lead! I am! You scared me half to death. Oh, I'm sorry, but you're Mrs. Ballard-Glen, right? Yes. The manager... He's been looking for you, and he needs to talk to you right away. About what? I don't know. I'm sorry. But he said it was important. Okay. Thank you. Have a good one. So we have 10:30, 11:30, and then finish at 12:30. Okay? Okay. Good. - Can you take that out for me? - Yeah. Can you please tell me what's going on, Tom? I don't have time for this. I got some pretty disturbing news from one of our employees... Miss Lexi Wolf. She left here in tears. What do you mean, disturbing? Well, she said you've been... sexually harassing her, stalking her, and demeaning her. So she refuses to come back to work unless your membership be revoked. Well, that's just not true. If anything, she has been the one... Look... Right. Well, if you wanna dispute this, you can file a counter report, and then we can get the authorities involved. The authorities? Mrs. Ballard-Glen, as you can imagine, we take this sort of thing very seriously. I don't want to involve the authorities. Okay. Well, she said she wouldn't take this thing any further and that she'll return to work on the condition that you leave immediately and that you pay for the remaining training sessions which is... I guess 20 sessions. This is ridiculous. She's a liar. Okay, do you wanna dispute this? No, just revoke my membership. I don't care. Well, I must advise you that if you do come back, we will be forced to take... Why would I ever wanna come back here? What the hell do you want? Tom called me and told me that you were leaving and it was safe for me to come back. Was it humiliating when I kicked you out? Why are you doing this to me? Mm. It's restitution for the past. What past? You're not making any sense. Let's just start with you giving me $50,000. Giving you? I thought it was a $5,000 loan. No, no, you have to learn to give, and your lack of interest has been quite substantial, so the price has gone up. I mean, if you had just paid me when I first asked you to, then... So it's about money. Well, it's about so many things, but let me ask you a question. What? What do you think would happen if I shared with the world what you, me, your husband did? What do you think it would do to you, your father, and his wholesome American brand? So you're blackmailing me. I'm just telling you what the stakes are. Veronica! Ready for another take? Uh... yes. Sorry. - You all right? - Yeah, of course. All right, come. Uh, give me a sec. All set. All right, guys, quiet on set! All right, this is "The new face for Cruncherz," take 5. And... action. Hi. I'm Veronica Ballard-Glen, and like my father and grandfather before me, I am honored to be in your home as the new face of Ballard. From our family to yours for over a hundred years. And... cut! I think we got it that time. What am I gonna do, Jordan? First thing to remember is it's not just you. We're in this together, okay? Yeah, except none of the crazy crap is happening to you. I know. I'm sorry. You know, the thing is, I tried to call her to give her the money, and her phone's disconnected. That's weird. How are you supposed to pay her? I don't know. I think she just wants me to live in fear so that she has all the control. I mean, how did she keep the fact that she's crazy hidden for three years? Everyone can hide their crazy to some degree. Hello? Hi, Donna. Right now? "Business Era" Magazine? Okay. All right. Thank you. Yes. Hello. My name is Sally Langley with the "Business Era." I'm so sorry for the technical issues. We're having a problem with our camera, but it doesn't matter. Everyone's just here to see you. Thank you. Don't even worry. Uh, excuse me one moment. I'm sorry, but your dad asked me to check in and see how you do. You know how he is. Of course. I'm sorry. Where were we? No worries. I know your father can be very particular. Didn't realize you could hear that. So let's just get straight into it, shall we? Absolutely. All right, first, I wanna talk to you about your image. I've watched lots of your interviews. I've looked at your social media, and I... I see that you've very well crafted this all-American, wholesome girl next door persona. Would you say that's the real you? Um... well... what do you mean? It's so obviously a calculated façade meant to align with the Ballards' 1950s old-fashioned Americana fantasy that never really existed in the first place. Why not drop the illusion and show the whole world the real Veronica? I'm sorry, but... I think we both know that the real Veronica is anything but the wholesome daddy's little girl... I didn't realize that this was going to be a hit piece. I'm, uh, going to have to end this. Do you mean that it's hitting a little too close to home? That obviously was not somebody from... Obviously. Let's just... forget about all this. No need to bore Dad with the details. Of course not. Thank you. I obviously didn't mention anything about the 3-way. Hmm. Thankfully, neither did she. Um, can you get the glasses? Yeah. Well, I guess I should prepare myself. What do you mean? Well, in case she goes to the tabloids or something. Guess I have to lie. Yeah, you're right. But you know what's got me most unsettled? What? She hasn't asked for the money again. But why? Good question. Hey! What the hell are you doing here? What's it look like I'm doing here? I'm working out, just like you. You don't go to this gym. What are you, following me? Hey, Lexi. Do you want the money or not? I'm done with this. I want all sorts of things from you. I want... your love. I want your anger... and I want your pain. You're a sick bitch. Well, looks like I already have your anger. You don't have the leverage you think you do. It's my word against yours. So... market research shows that pivoting to Veronica has us up 37% across all demographics. And the thing that popped out at us the most was the age group. 27% of that are between 15 and 35. What does that tell us? Social media. Now, of course, you have a lot of folks telling you, "Social media is gonna take advantage of all of us." Uh... I have to take this. My word against yours? Well, that video is worth a thousand words... 50,000 to be exact. Veronica. Are you okay? I'm s... I'm so, so sorry. What's going on? You just walked out of the meeting. I-I just... I don't feel very well. I... think I should go home and rest. Feel better. And let me know if you can't do the Luncherz launch presentation on Friday. No, I... I'll be there, I promise. All right, then. Hey! What's up? There's a video. She made a video. What am I gonna do? Wait, wait. Hold on. A video? Yeah, I don't know. Somehow she recorded us that night. She just sent it to my work email, Gillian, through email. Okay, okay. Um... I need you to take a deep breath. You take a deep breath. I need solutions right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for snapping at you. It's okay. I get it. All right, we need to, uh... we need to figure out a plan here. A plan. Right. That's a good idea. You need to find something on her. Leverage. I already Googled the hell out of her. It's like she doesn't exist. Okay. All right. Wait a minute. Um... I have an idea. Okay, I'm listening. Uh, I'm not gonna suggest the police because I know you don't want that, but I... I really think that we should hire a private investigator. Someone like her probably hasn't colored in the lines her entire life. There has got to be something out there from her past that we can use. I'm telling you, there is nothing out there. Wait a minute. Can a private investigator break into her place? Not legally, no. Then I will. Veronica, I... I-I don't know about this. If there's anything I've learned, you can't count on anyone else to solve your problems. Do you even know where she lives? Not yet. Hey, how was your day, honey? Let's just go to the bank and get this over with. I'll get your blood money. What's the rush... love? Okay, we can talk about the money in a bit, but first let me ask you something. When was the last time you... went to church? Church? Church? Isn't your dad one of the main benefactors at Sacred Heart? How do you even... So it's been a while. Christmas Mass is probably the last time that I... But what does this have to do with anything? Maybe you should start going more often. You're overdue for confession. And what is it that you want me to confess? That I've had sex with... You have to go further back than that to get to your original sin. I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm sure that your confession would take considerably longer than mine. My conscience is clean. You have no conscience. You're right. Let's go to the bank. I have to know. How did you do it? Oh, that. My phone was recording our little love session from inside my purse. Why didn't you just send the video from the beginning? I figured if I couldn't get off with you again, then I could get off on messing with your perfect life. So this is all just a game to you? No. No, not at all. No, I genuinely felt a real connection between... the three of us. You need help. Mm. But you're helping me. You're helping me work through all these complicated feelings... Our little game. Thank you for that, my love. What the hell were you thinking? I went looking for leverage in case she wanted to take things further. It was dangerous. All right? You didn't even find anything. I found a Sacred Heart yearbook. At first I thought maybe we went to school together, but I didn't find her in it. I guess she just has an infatuation with me. Well, maybe now that she has the money, she'll leave you alone. Maybe. So ultimately, it's our brand's natural progression. I mean, what comes after breakfast? Lunch. Speaking of which, we have a lovely spread right outside, so please, eat up. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Well done. Oh, no, thank you. Thank you. I think that went very well. I do, too. It's crazy to think it only took a hundred years to expand beyond breakfast. Well, slow but steady wins the race. So another hundred, we'll make it to dinner. 109. Um... I see someone I know. Okay. Leonard, may I interrupt? Yes, of course, I was just having a conversation with this charming young lady. Lexi, was it? - That's right, Leonard. - Pleasure. I already gave you 50 grand. What the hell are you doing here? Mingling. Great speech, by the way. I did notice, though, that you didn't serve any of your own product to the guests here. Hmm. I guess Luncherz is just for the masses, just like your whole act. What do you want? $100,000. I don't have that kind of liquidity, Lexi. Mm, ask Daddy. I can't ask him. No, you don't want to ask him. I'll ask him. $100,000. Meet me at Sacred Heart in exactly 48 hours. You look so worried, hmm? It's just part of our game. Games are supposed to be fun, right? I'm having fun. Aren't you? So you want me to ask him for money, too? She has all the power. I think you should give her what she wants. And what am I supposed to say to him? I don't know. Why does this all come down to me? Don't you think that I hate that it comes down on you? All right, you know my family doesn't have any money. Trust me, if I could, I would ask. I would steal it if I thought it would fix things for you. I'm sorry for taking it out on you. It's okay. So... What do I say to him? Say... Say it's for a vacation home, in, uh, in Florida. Really? It's that, or we have her arrested for blackmail. All right, but then all this gets out. Those are our choices. Those are our choices. I said no. Absolutely not. Come on in, sweetheart. Is this a bad time? I can come back. No, it is always a good time to talk with my daughter. This discussion is over. Everything all right? Uh, yeah, why? Well, lately you've seemed, um... preoccupied. Oh, I'm fine. It's just... a learning curve. Second thoughts? No. No. Not at all. Because I don't want you to feel any pressure. I want this to be something that you want. Dad, don't worry. I want this. But... that's not why I'm here. Okay, then, why are you here? Well... um, Jordan and I found a beach house in Florida, and we'd like to buy it. That's wonderful. Yeah, um... we wanna fly out and take a look at it, but... But? Um... We're short on the down payment. How short? $100,000. And you'd like me to loan you the money. Well, all of my savings went into the remodel, and unless you give me access to my trust... Veronica, you make a substantial salary here. Surely, you could save up that money in no time. What's the rush? Well, the property is, um... Time-sensitive. Exactly. And we really want it. Hmm. You know why I'm not going to give you the money? Take a look at some of the kids you went to private school with. So many of them are still spoiled, confused, aimless children. They never really grew up ready for the real world. But I work hard, Dad. And I always have. Well, then I've done my job. Veronica. You're not upset with me, are you? No. I'm not upset at you. Oh, V. You must be feeling so trapped. I hate to say it, but I think you only have one option. Going to the police is not an option. Honey, it's your only option. Not only would I probably be fired for violating my morality clause, but it's the nightmare that the controversy would cause my father. Controversies go away. This woman won't. I'm here. Gotta go. Okay. Good luck. You don't have it, do you? No. I don't. I asked my dad, and he didn't give it to me. I don't want excuses. I want $100,000. Release the video. Then what? Then your blackmailing stops. And what will you do then? I'm gonna watch your whole world fall apart. And I'm gonna watch your family brand get sullied. - But I have tried... - Respect the game. Respect me. I love the taste of fear, especially yours. God, give me the strength to bestow your justice upon the wicked. God, give me the strength to bestow your justice upon the wicked. God, give me the strength. God, give me the strength to bestow your justice upon the wicked. God, give me the strength to bestow your justice. Amen. What now? I found it in his food bowl. She took Cody! Why didn't you call me?! Tutoring was canceled. I just got home. I... It's a nightmare. This can't be happening. Wait. Where are you going? To get Cody. You coming? Of course I am. Her car's not here. Looks deserted. Yeah, I know. What should we do now? We wait. For how long? For as long as it takes. What's going on? She never came home. Crap. I'm late for work. Obviously, I'll call in sick. I don't wanna... If anything happens to him, I swear... Cody's safe... for now. But the amount's gone up. $150,000 in 24 hours in cash. Let me make one thing clear. If you don't pay up, you can say goodbye to your dog. What are we gonna do? I don't know. What about... What? Well, there's that jewelry from your grandmother. You know, maybe. It's worth a shot. I mean... My grandmother gave me this on her deathbed... and her mother before that. I remember when she gave it to you. Veronica, are you sure you wanna do this? We have no choice. I knew it wouldn't be enough. I'm sorry, honey. You know what? I've... I've had enough. I'm just gonna go to the police. Whoa, whoa, you sure? Yeah, I don't have any other choice. Maybe you should tell your father first. Really? Shouldn't he be the first to know? You know, and he might be able to pay her off with one of those legal agreements. I think the rich and powerful use it all the time. It's like a... It's like legalized blackmail. That's true. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Of course I'll get fired. But I suppose I should just go now, let him make that choice. You haven't slept. You haven't eaten. You haven't showered. Don't you think you should wait till he gets off work? I just don't wanna waste any more time. I know. I know. Well, look, we've... we have come this far. All right, it's all gonna end one way or the other. I don't think a few hours is gonna make a difference. Right? You wanna be in the right state of mind when you talk to him. You know, self-care's important in times like these. Not that we've beenin times like these before, but... You should take a nap. Mm. I could use one. Although I don't think I could sleep right now. Well, it's worth a try. Come on, I'll make you some food. Aah! Oh, my God. You scared me. I barely recognize you with your new hairdo. That's because it's my old hairdo. So is it done? Yes. I put two sleeping pills in her food. She'll be knocked out for quite a while. Plenty of time to do what we need to do. Look, you know, I didn't wanna do it this way. All right, in the beginning, it was just supposed to be enough so we could get away. All right, go somewhere, reinvent ourselves. I know, I know, but I have my reasons for asking for more money. Yeah, for what, the renovation you got going on? No, Jordan, these people... Money makes their world go round, right? So what better way to shatter it than by taking it away? Look, you know I hate being poor Mr. Veronica Ballard... All right, the schoolteacher that lives off her family's money. But I don't understand why this has become so personal against her. If I told you my reasons, I'd have to kill you. Uh-huh. Okay. We have to get ready. We're running out of time. It's risky, Lexi. The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. Burner phones. And... Come on. We gotta hurry. 6:30? But I set an alarm. Jordan?! Jordan! As you can see, the men in your life are with me. So if you want them back, you'll send me a million dollars worth of crypto by the end of the day tomorrow. With your father... indisposed, I know you have access to corporate funds. And don't even think about calling the police. If I feel cornered at all, I'm taking them all down with me. Sins of the father and of the daughter will be paid. God, he was heavy. I think I threw my back out. Maybe you should go to a yoga class. How can you be joking at a time like this? "A," who said I was joking? And "B," why are you whispering? Because if he wakes up... All right, he finds out it's me, then we have to... Kill him? Oh, come on. What's one less rich a... Stop. Lexi. Relax. The amount of Ketamine we gave him will keep him asleep for hours. Plus, it eliminates the possibility of him remembering anything. I don't know. It, uh... - This all just feels so wrong. - Oh, my God. Would you just stop with the whispering? Thank you for understanding. Done. I called all the board members, and they're all in agreement. The funds will be released by the end of the day. And you're sure you don't wanna call the police? Yes, I'm positive. I don't want anything to happen to Jordan and my father. But that's not gonna stop you from looking for them, is it? Absolutely not. Okay. Where do we start? You really did want it to go this way the whole time, didn't you? God, what was I thinking?! You know, this whole faking my death thing? No, no. No? Well, maybe... you don't have to fake it. Sorry. I know I've misled you a little. My bad. We have to assume she's not working alone. She can't kidnap two grown men by herself. That's true, but... she is a personal trainer. And she keeps referring to the past and Sacred Heart and confessions and meeting at a church. But I've looked through that yearbook a hundred times, and she's not in there. Maybe she changed her name. But there's no one in there that even resembles her. Could she have had plastic surgery? I mean, if she did, how would I... Wait a minute. There was this one girl. But I forget her name. Everyone made fun of her. She was shy and plain-looking, nothing like... That's her. Sarah Birch. Why, Lexi? It's not, Lexi, actually. It's Sarah Birch. Sound familiar? Sacred Heart? I know. I looked a lot different back then. But, Jordan... we were so in love. I loved you. You were in love with me. Or at least that's how it felt, anyway. Do you remember when, uh... you picked up my books for me when you were walking me home? No. Yeah, I knew. I knew from that moment that what we had was something special, even if you didn't say anything to me. Our love was the only thing that kept me going. You're delusional. Veronica. Yes. Veronica. She... stole you from me. I saw you. Premarital sex? In a school that was part of the church? Turns out she was always such a sanctimonious hypocrite... even back then. Stop, stop, stop, stop, Lexi. It's Sarah. Sarah! What are you up to, V.? Just a little detective work. Bingo. She inherited a house from her mother's sister when she died. Do you remember my mother? She worked in the cafeteria. She cleaned toilets at night just so I could go to your fancy school. After she died... they kicked me out. They asked you. They... asked you if they could use some of the money from the scholarship fund that youcreated to pay for the rest of my education. You said no. Because I was from the wrong side of the tracks, and you thought it made the school look bad. I... I changed my name. I... I found my way into her life, and I waited. I waited on God's perfect timing, and He... He answered my prayers. Weapon. Dad! Dad, can you... Come on. No, please, don't! I'll stop it if you throw that aside. Better? You killed Jordan? He was in on it. I mean... he didn't know the whole story. But let's just say the whole ménage à trois was not the first time that him and I have been... intimate. God, I love it when you're feisty. This is for stealing Jordan from me at Sacred Heart, and this is for your father kicking me out of school! Goodbye, Wayne. Lexi, wait. Do you remember our first kiss? I... I do. You're a terrible kisser. Dad. Oh. Veronica. Oh. Get your feet. Come on. Thank you so much for not listening to me. You know, for calling the police. What are best friends for? Here. Cheers... to being on the other side of... all of it. Why does the other side feel so empty? 'Cause Jordan wasn't the man you thought he was. I know it's a lot to process right now. But it will get easier. - Promise? - Absolutely. Little by little, day by day. - You know what? - What? I think you're right. Of course I am.
