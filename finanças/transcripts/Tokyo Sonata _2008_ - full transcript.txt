I have to get ready. Just listen to what I have to say. Okay. You're talented. Extraordinarily so. Are there any musicians in your family? No. I see. You were just born with it. Once in a while, there are children like you. Is that so? I think you should go to a school specialising in music. Of course you'll have to take an exam. But this is an important discussion I need to have with your parents. -lmpossible. -Why? My father is against me learning piano. I didn't realise... And there's stuff going on at home. I don't know what'll happen if I mention piano lessons... I can explain it to them. I'll tell them myself. Please, just give me a little time. It's a cleaning job at a shopping centre. Is that okay? Yes. -Any preference for working hours? -I'll leave it up to you. Okay. When can you start? Anytime. This is for plastics, this is for wood, this is for veneer. But only use this one for painted veneer. And this is multi-purpose. Use it for anything , got that? Can't I just clean everything with that one? No! -Why not...? -It's not professional. -Why do we carry it around? -It's for just in case. Excuse me, we need to clean the restroom. Stay in touch, okay? Swear to me, you won't get into trouble. -I won't. -You swear? Listen ... Why don't you divorce him, Mum? Just get a divorce. You're still totally fine. What are you talking about? That's the one thing that worries me. Who else will play mother in the family? What difference does it make? It's not as easy as that. Really? Being in the role of a mother isn't all bad, you know. I just don't get it. I'll be off, then. NATlONAL BORDER No question about it. He owes three months' lunch money. Really? I give it to him every month without fail. Also, he's excused himself early from classes... ...countless times. Do you know the reasons why? No, I don't. Is he being bullied? If anything, he does the bullying . Which child? Me. I'm an adult so it hardly bothers me, but your son is definitely out of place here. Really? It's something you should discuss within the family. I will. Hey! You can't just barge in here! What's that? It's nothing ! Get out! What did you do with your lunch money? You haven't paid for three months. I was so embarrassed when your teacher told me. What did you spend that 1 5,000 yen on? This? No, I found it on the street! Then what did you spend it on? And tell me the truth. On piano lessons. I'll get a job and pay back the 15,000 yen, all right? You're kidding? Piano lessons? You should have told me. I would've paid for them. But you said, "No piano." I did. But pocketing your lunch money is worse. But I don't mind you learning piano. I think men who play the piano are attractive. Don't tell Dad. You know he'll never let me. All right, then. KANEKO PlANO SCHOOL Welcome home. It seems Kenji's been taking piano lessons in secret. Really? He's been lying to us all this time, the little sod. Kenji, get down here ! We need to talk! Please, don't get too mad at him. I won't. But he needs to be told once and for all. We got a letter from the Kaneko Music School. It recommends that you apply to a music conservatoire. Explain what's going on . Explain ! I just studied a little piano. -Behind our backs? -Who cares what I do? -I thought I told you , "No piano." -That makes no sense. If you don't think I'm making sense, then just say so ! Going behind our backs, hoping you won't get caught, I hate that kind of cowardly attitude more than anything ! Look at this... I n the letter from Kaneko, it says Kenji's piano playing is extraordinary. That he's a rare child prodigy. How can you possibly believe that? How could our child be a prodigy? Who the hell is this Kaneko, anyway? This guy's nothing but bullshit! My teacher isn't like that! -And besides... -What? She's a she, not a guy. What a idiot! These music schools praise everyone, that's how they make a living ! I'll give up playing piano, then! Just leave me alone ! This is all your fault for not telling us. You're the liar, Dad. What? You're lying when you say you'll listen if I talk. No matter how much I talk to you, you won't change your mind ! Just like Mr Eroto. All you really want to do is lecture me and act tough ! Stop it! Are you okay? Go on upstairs. Don't hit him. Why can't he play piano? Once I've said no, I can't go back on it. It affects my authority as a parent. I was too lenient with Takashi, so I'm shoving my parental values down Kenji's throat if I have to. You have to stand by me. He needs a clear message from both parents. What's that look for? I saw you the other day. You were standing in the free food line at the park. You're unemployed, right? -You knew? -Yes, all along. Why didn't you say anything? Because if I had , your authority would be screwed. Screw your authority. What? Kenji! Call an ambulance ! -I was just trying to grab him ... -Shut up and call ! This is the 11:00 News. The US announces it is expanding its war effort in the Middle East and planning an increase in military deployment. According to the US Department of Defense, this deployment will include soldiers of any nationality. This means it is likely that the 138 soldiers recently recruited from Japan will also be deployed. A growing number of Japanese youths are volunteering for the US military. We interviewed some young people to assess their views on the subject. I support it. We have a lot of trade with America, so if America has a problem that means Japan's directly affected. So I think it's a good thing to cooperate with the US to try to help solve their problems. I think that...like... ...like it's really good if they're serious about it. I support the troops. According to the Japanese Constitution, it explicitly prohibits our country from going to war. So I can't believe it that our government let them join up. -Kenji! -How is he? I detected no brain abnormalities. He does have concussion but otherwise he's fine. Thank goodness. Thank you so much. I told you not to do that! Come on ! Takashi ! I'm back. I'm exhausted. You should have told us you were coming home. We saw it on the news and we were so worried about you. But I'm glad you're home. I killed so many people. I killed too many. Takashi... Excuse me, I need the number for the Foreign Ministry. I'm the mother of one of the new volunteers for the US military. I wanted to find out if there's any way to determine his safety. Yes. Whether he's safe... Oh, I see. So it's impossible, then? It's not... It's not...what you think! THREE HOURS EARLlER Scream and I'll kill you! The cash ! Where is it? You don't have any? You're lying ! There's no cash in the house. Why not? That was close. She saw me! Fuck, she saw my face! What should I do? Get up! What are you going to do? You're my hostage. Come with me. May I take my jacket and purse? -Can you drive? -Yes. Good. Do it! Oh, right. What are you doing? Put it back! What kind of car is this? I don't know. I just stole it. Drive! Who's that? My neighbour, Okada-san. -She's not a cop? -Not at all. -Go straight on. -Okay. The next left. -You forgot to signal. -Oh, sorry. -Not the wipers! -Oh, sorry Eyes on the road ! Erm... What? Can you put that thing down? Do you do this sort of thing a lot? A lot? Are you kidding? Why, then? I was good at picking locks. I could pick any lock in a flash. So I decided to go professional. -A professional thief? -Of course not. A locksmith. But I quickly failed. I'm not a good businessman. No matter how many times, I always failed. I just can't get along with people. And now finally... ... I've even failed at robbery. I understand. The hell you do! I can always crash this damned car! I need to use the bathroom. -You'll run off! -I won't! Welcome. Why did you come back? I promised I would, right? What are you thinking? Nothing. Right, then... I'll drop you off at a station somewhere. I'll go on alone. You go back home. I can't go home. I've come this far... ... I can't go home now. Hey, Sasaki. Hey, Taguchi, what's up? -Running away. -For real? I'm sick of it all. School, crammer school, family hour... I've had enough ! Oh, thank you. -How's your piano lessons? -I quit. Yeah? Grown-ups just please themselves. It's my dad, shit! He's following me. Hey, what's wrong? It's an asthma attack. Are you okay? -I'll go and buy some juice. -Don't go. You'll be fine. If my dad finds me, he'll batter me. I'll be right back. A dead end. I don't care what happens anymore. What about you? I'll go see what's up ahead. Do you think I can start all over again? From this moment on... ...do you think I can start all over again? Is that land over there? Or a boat? I can't see. I can't see a thing! How wonderful it would be if my whole life so far... ...turns out to have been a dream... ...and suddenly I wake up and I'm someone else entirely. How can I... ...start all over again? How can I... I want to start again. What am I doing? I'm nothing more than one failure after another! I'm just...a total failure! Don't hurt yourself, please! You're the only person who can be you. That's all we have to hold onto. Are you... ... really... ...God? Hey, wake up. What do you think that is over there? It looks like a star, but it's so low in the sky. Hey, wake up. Wake up, wake up! Gotcha! He was sneaking into the baggage compartment. A fare cheater? Hey, is that true? He won't say a word. I understand. I'll take him in. Name, address, phone number, school name. I don't care which, just tell me. You can't go home if you don't talk. You won't talk? You leave me no choice but to book you as an adult fare cheater. You okay with that? This way, straight. Now that way. Don't move. Hey, get up. They dropped your case. You're free to go. I'm home. -Where's your father? -He's not home. Hungry? I'll cook you something. Eh? LOST AND FOUND You look strange, Dad. This is the 9:00 News. The US military has been expanding its war zone in the Middle East. The Department of Defense is expected to announce yet another development later today. According to sources, a pull-back in US troop strength in the Middle East is anticipated, with the result that the 3,000 international volunteers, including the 1 38 Japanese soldiers, will be returning to their native countries. FOUR MONTHS LATER Sorry I haven't written for ages. I hope everyone's well. Recently, I've come to realise that America isn't the only one that's right. That's why I've decided to stay a while in this country so I can learn to understand the people better. I've come to the conclusion that the best path for me is to fight alongside these people in order to find true happiness. Please don't worry about me. I'm doing fine. I'll write again.
