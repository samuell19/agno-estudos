- [Narrator] Sino, a small planet isolated from its nearest living neighbor by a hundred million miles. It is a time of violence and brutality as a corrupt governing power has spread it's dark wings of lawlessness and dictatorship across the entire planet. Those who oppose are captured, tortured and killed. No one has ever dared to escape. Till now. - [Zane] Come. Come on, let's go. We're almost there. Come on, hurry up. Come on. - [Man On Radio] Attention unit seven, two escapees seen going south. Take them to re-assembly. If they resist, fire. - Come on let's go. Come on, get up. Damn. - You are now mine, prisoner. - This is the third day in this brig. No food. No water. I wonder if they wanna keep me here much longer. They should have killed me by now. Or am I gonna starve to death? Man, it won't be much longer before I start to look like this. When will this all end? When will we have total freedom again? I want to be free. I want to be free. - You have a visitor, prisoner. Here, you can have him. - My dear friends, welcome. I am honored that all of you are available at this special gathering. This year, for you, I have great entertainment. From around the galaxy, I have selected seven men. Slaves, fighters and prisoners whose fate was death to compete in a game of strength, a game of skill, a game of survival, in which the winner will regain his freedom. Now, I ask you, which is better? To die for your sins or to participate in a game of strategy and have the opportunity to gain your freedom with dignity? I am giving these men a chance. That's why I'm considered a great being. I am powerful, yet fair to others. That's what I am. - Tell us more about this game. - With pleasure. The game will take place on a planet known as Earth in a City called Los Angeles. The fighters will have 60 hours from the time of their arrival to find and return to me this ball. It was a gift from my father. - Where will the ball be? How will they find it? - What makes this game so interesting, is how I've planned everything so precisely. The ball will be transferred to Earth and will be hidden in an inconspicuous place. Each fighter will be provided with a non-firing weapon and a locating device that will signal the whereabouts of the ball. It is up to the individual to find the quickest way to obtain the ball since they may kill and destroy anything to get to it. Provided that they follow a few simple rules. Rules that must be followed. - What kind of rules? - Three simple, but important rules. One, a fighter will eliminate another only when the defender possesses the ball. Two, they may only use the weapon assigned to them. Three, and the most important, there will be only one winner. - And what prevents them from escaping? - My dear friend, what better punishment for disobedience, than death? I have placed micro sensors in their skins. Any attempt to break the rules, or to escape, will result in immediate termination. - Brilliant. - Very good. - Perhaps what makes this game especially interesting is the uniqueness of each fighter. This is Skullblaster. The one I'm most proud of having. The most vicious of them all. Responsible for any crime conceivable. Rape, murder, burning animals alive. He is a simple man programmed to kill. Nothing stands in his way. I have a strong feeling he will be the one who will win. He is absolutely the best. Cyan» bum mane. He was sentenced to death for slaughtering millions of men only for his entertainment. Minig, small but deadly. He was a prisoner who tricked and killed eight guards and escaped. Zooloj, an extremely violent and ruthless fighter, who after killing his enemies, amputated their heads for his skull collection. Baarg, enormously strong. This mans was a slave who killed and burned his owners. Moozy, a great and deadly fighter who was ordered to be killed for treason. And the last one, is Zane. I found him on planet Zikon. He was a prisoner who tried to escape with his friend. They were both captured. He was the lucky one who survived to be one of my contestants. Now, I ask you to keep your attentions on the monitors as I transfer the fighters to Earth. - Well, my friends, the game will begin shortly. In the course of the game, they will speak a common language as I've prepared their minds while they were unconscious. - Hey, check it out, man. Nice look. Hey, slick, how you doing? Forget about it. Listen, I got some of this stuff. I make it in basement. Guaranteed one hit shit, man. It's going to get you stoned. Check it out, man. Half off today for suckers. Five for five bucks. Easy, man, five bucks. Cough it... Hey man, what did you just do, man? What did you do? Man, okay, fine. Cough up the money, man. Five bucks, come on. Small leaves. Hey, be cool, fool. Hey, all right, all right. You're the boss. Boss of shitheads if you ask me. Look at this dude, man. Fuck you. Lousy illiterates messing up my city. That's all I'm gonna give you. - Can I help you with something? - I need to go south. - Yeah, how far you going? - Not far. - Well, you know what? I'm going to downtown. Maybe I can drop you off on the way. - Fair enough. - Well, hop on in. Stupid radio broke down. So do you live around here? - No. - Go ahead, take one. You must be new here. It's not really good for you either, you know. You better not even start. Okay, this is Hollywood. Take it easy, man. Don't get in trouble now. Adios. ♪ I feel pretty ♪ ♪ Oh, so pretty ♪ - Oh. That's a USDA hunk. Hi, going my way? Come on, big guy. Get in the car. That's it, just open it up. Get that big muscular body in here. Now pull. Come on, pull, baby. Come on, pull. Oh. That's a real nice outfit. Where'd you get that? Trashy Lingerie? Hey, don't get in a tizzy, honey. I was joking. You're very big and muscular. I like that in a man.

Hey, man, this is my last offer. How about- How about 25? - Water. Water. I want water. - [Female Voice] Randall, is that you? - Open the door, open it. - [Female Voice] Honey, did you buy the pseudoephedrine, egg nog, and the curl kit for Fifi? And the batteries for my toothbrush? Oh, I'm so glad you're home. - Hey, hey, hey- You wanna buy starlings? - No. - Can I help you with something? - Where's the ball? This is my ball. - Hey, no problem. - Ha! - What a strange character. - Where's the ball? - Get out. Get out of there. Get out. - Hey, man, he's still alive. All right. - My dear friends, you just witnessed how the weak kill the mighty. There's now only 50 hours till the end of the game, and only five fighters remaining. - [Male Voice] Zane, I'm watching you. I'm over here. You're doomed. You cannot win. You have to stay. You are weak. Over here, Zane. You are doomed. - Hey, there's no sleeping on the park benches. Get up. I've seen your gang here before destroying the place, writing your shit all over. Hmm, you looking at me? Ah, what have we got here? Punk. - Freeze. - Get out. A [WWW ma ma. - On, my God. You okay? My leg, it's broken. I can't move. My leg, it's killing me. I can't walk. I'm hurt. - Where's the ball? - Open the door. Open it. Open the door. Open the door. Open it. - What do you want from me? - I don't mean you any harm. I just need your help. - Don't hurt me, please. - I'm not. There's some people after me. Look, I gotta get out of here. Do you live around here? Why don't you take me there? - That guy back there, was he after you? - Yeah, we're all part of a game. I haven't got much time. - A game? - Yeah, it's my last chance. - [Cindy] I don't understand. - It's best if you don't. Come inside and lock the door. Is there another way to get in here? - No. - Okay, listen. I'm going to have to hide out here tonight. If you cooperate, everything will be fine and I should be out of your life by tomorrow morning, all right? - Mm hmm. - Look, do you have anything to eat around here? - Some frozen pizza. Do you want me to heat it up? - What's a frozen pizza? Good frozen pizza. - I need to go next door to pick something up from my friend. - Okay. - Hello, there, warrior. Look what I found in the elevator. You can have her back in exchange for the ball. Come on, the ball, or I'll chop her head right off. Stop. That's more like it. - Let her go now. - Yeah, right. Sure I will. Here. - How do you feel? - Okay. Where's that man? Is he gone? - Yeah, he's gone. And he won't be coming back. - Is the game really going on? - Yeah, and unless I get that ball back, I'm finished. - You mean you need the ball to win and you let him have it to save me? - I must get it back. - If I knew exactly what was going on, maybe I could help you. - Yeah. Food. - This place you come from, what is it like? - My people have been suffering for many years. They don't have much freedom. We don't have much choice. It's our word against our government's. We've been fighting a hopeless war for as long as I can remember. - If you win this game, what will you do? - I don't know. My fate is in someone else's hands. - This Gothic, what does he want? Where does he come from? Why does he- - I don't know too much about him. Just that he thinks he's doing us a favor by giving us a chance. - My friends, the game will end at noon today. The fighter who possesses the ball at that time, is the bravest, the strongest and the best. He will be the winner deserving of my offering. As you see, Moozy is presently in possession of the ball. He is within a jungle. If he should defeat Zane and Skullblaster before noon, then the game will end earlier and he will be summoned to accept his prize of freedom. But remember one thing, Skullblaster cannot be taken lightly. - We're not far from it here. - All of this seems so bizarre. I mean, it's like something you see in the movies. - Everything I've told you is true. You're blessed to have such justice and freedom in your government. - What happens if you don't make it on time? - There can only be one winner. The rest will be terminated. Thanks for helping me out. Take good care of yourself. - Cindy. - Zane. Zane. - Cindy. - Zane, where are you. Zane. - Cindy. - He tried to kill me. We got to get out of here. - Okay, let's go. - Got a flat tire. When I came out to fix it, he attacked me. I think he wants to kill both of us. - Which one was it? What did he look like? - It was the big, muscular guy who attacked me the night of that- that accident. - Yeah, that's Skullblaster. He's vicious. We'll be safe here for a while. - I fell down. - We should take care of that. - Where do we go from here? - There isn't much time left. I must keep the ball in my possession. I'm afraid all we can do is run and hide. - Are you scared as I am? - My concern right now is to protect you. - How sweet. Now I can kill both of you. - Here, run. Come on. Let's hurry. I think I'm the last one. What time is it? - It's 11:55. Only five minutes left. - They're not acknowledging me. That means one of them is still alive. - Let go. Let me go. - [Cindy] Help, help. Help. Zane, help. Zane. - Careful. - Thank God. - Congratulations, fighter. You are the winner. You're a free man and can go anywhere in the universe. - I hope you and the rest of your crazy friends enjoy this sick game of yours. - How dare you? - How dare you kill people for fun? - Silence, before I- - Before you what? Kill me too? You're a contemptible being. - You just ruined your chances. You doesn't deserve to live any longer. - It is you who doesn't deserve to live any longer. I'll see you in hell. Game's over, fellas. - Zane. - I got a lot learning to do. Maybe you can teach me a few things since I'm gonna be spending the rest of my life here.
