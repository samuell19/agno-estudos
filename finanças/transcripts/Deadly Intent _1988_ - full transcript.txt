(BIRDS CHIRPING) (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (WHISTLES) (GUNSHOT) RAYMOND: Harley, run, run! (GUNSHOTS) (GRUNTING) No. (YELLING) Help me, Raymond. Help me. (GRUNTING) I won. It's mine. (PANTING) (ANIMAL SCREECHING) (HORNS HONKING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Um, welcome home, Raymond. Good to have you back, Raymond. Hey, Brad. Is he really the only one who made it back? Unfortunately. Jesus, Laura, what a flagrant ass. When are you gonna call it quits? Well, the problem is with Raymond, you can't just call it quits. Raymond, are we getting together tonight? I got a little business to take care of first. Your wife? Sometimes. I never go over the same territory twice. Remember that. ELISE: Ladies and gentlemen, and now for our guest of honor, Mr. Raymond Keaton. (CROWD APPLAUDING) I accept this tribute on behalf of myself and those men that didn't make it back. They were courageous, unselfish, brave, and they also knew the risks we were taking as I knew the risks. This was a chance of a lifetime, and I would do it again tomorrow, no matter what the outcome was. I'd especially like to express my gratitude to my boss, Elise Marlowe, who owns this gallery and financed the expedition. I'm sorry I didn't bring anything back, Elise. Better luck next time. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Now this, I don't understand this one at all. Ah, Mr. Keaton. Hi. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I'm always available for confession. In an hour? At the mission? Okay. Are you sure you didn't bring anything back for me? You doubt me, Elise? No, I don't doubt you. I don't trust you either. Besides, this expedition cost me a great deal of money. Not enough that you'll miss it. I just hate losing any of it. Worse still, I despise being cheated out of it. You see, Raymond, besides disliking you, distrusting you, and doubting you, I also know you. We're a lot alike, aren't we? But don't worry, Elise, you're gonna get what's coming to you. I hope so. If not, I'll take your other eye out. Ooh! Huh. Do you mind? What's the matter? Did you get your ego stroked today? Why don't you just stay here with the losers, I got business to do, all right? You're the loser, you stay. Ah, that cut me. That cut me right to the quick, man. What is it, our anniversary, or didn't anybody hit on you? I want a divorce. You got a cigarette? Please? God, you look pretty tonight. Mmm. You didn't hear me. I'm leaving you. Do you know how I feel when you say that? You know how I feel? Like I want to laugh. (LAUGHS) I'm not doing this anymore. There's nothing left. There is nothing. You're nothing. You satisfied? (HORN HONKING REPEATEDLY) (HONKING CONTINUES) Elise. You wanna play? (HORN HONKING) (SIGHS) (TIRES SQUEALING) All right. I'll play. (BRAKES SCREECHING) (ENGINE STARTING) HARLEY: Hi, Raymond. Remember me? Stupid jerk. (HORN HONKING) Come on, meathead! Jerk! (BRAKES SCREECHING) Damn you. Damn you, Raymond. (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING) VICKY: Thank you. Well, ready? LAURA: Ready. VICKY: Okay, let's go. LAURA: Do I really have to look at him again? VICKY: Thank God he was thrown clear. Good morning, Mrs. Keaton. If there's anything not to your liking, please let me know. Thank you. It's customary for the family to view privately before anyone else. LAURA: I didn't like looking at him when he was alive. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen. I'm so sorry, Laura dear. I'll stop by soon. You're holding up very well. Thank you, Elise. These people. Don't worry, it's nearly over. Oh, I wish it was over now. I'm Father Weston and this is Sister Nadine. We're from the parish here. We'd like to offer our condolences in your time of grief. In times such as these it's quite natural for the bereaved to feel alone. And we understand this, but should you feel the need to talk to anyone, we are available. Day or night. Uh, perhaps we might check in on you in a couple days, see how you're getting along? Oh, that's very kind. Jeff! Raymond said that you... Raymond always liked to exaggerate. I'm sorry, Laura. Oh. Thank you. Decorum, children. Stop it, Elise. We've known each other for years. I know that, but everybody else doesn't. I'll see you at the gravesite. When did you get back? It's a long story. Well, how about if you come over for dinner later and we talk about it then? I look forward to it. It's wonderful to see you again. You too. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) Mr. Ramirez. Good afternoon, Father, Sister. I thank you for being so prompt. Thank you, for your donation. How long do you plan to be with us, Mr. Ramirez? I must take care of my business in one week. Under present circumstances that's hardly enough time for the mission. Strangers have become involved. I desire to see it more than anything I can think of. Perhaps if I donate more to your services? I assure you, you will not be disappointed. Good. I would find it so depressing. Well, till the end of the week, then. End of the week. Father, Sister. The end of the week? Let us pray. (CLOCK TICKING) (ALARM RINGING) (GROANS) (SIGHS) Oh, Jeff. Oh. (DOG BARKING) Hello, this is Laura Keaton. There's somebody in my home. 1416 Bell Canyon Road. (HINGES CREAKING) (SCREAMING) (PANTING) (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) (SOBBING) Mrs. Keaton, do you have anything of, um, serious value in the house? Um, jewelry, cash... In a safe, maybe? No, nothing. I don't have that kind of money. And you're sure nothing's missing? Lieutenant, I told you, I don't think this man is a thief. Quite a dinner party. Jeff. What's the trouble? Uh, well, someone broke in here a while ago, Mr., uh... Jeff Kirkwood. I was Mr. Keaton's partner. I see, uh. Well, will you be around here for a while, Mr. Kirkwood? As long as I'm needed. Good. Uh, can you give us any more of a description to go on, Mrs. Keaton? No. It was dark. I didn't see him clearly. Well, if you remember anything, will you call us? Yeah. Let's wrap it up, guys. Thanks a lot. LAURA: Well, sorry I wasn't more prepared. Oh, you don't know how many times I dreamed about hot dogs and relish in that jungle. (CHUCKLING) Really? Yeah, really. What was it like there? Raymond said this one was different. You know how Raymond always talked about that Mayan tribe that was supposed to be extinct? We found them, deeper in the interior than anyone had ever been. But they weren't too friendly and they took us prisoner. Anyway, Raymond and this guy named Harley escaped and stole their god, a 3-foot statue. I never saw Raymond again. We escaped that night and a week later we made it to the coast. And that's when we discovered that Raymond had gotten away. I'm glad you made it. I am, too. Sleep well? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, but... Not as well as I would have slept upstairs. What kind of girl do you think I am? Besides, we wouldn't want people getting the wrong idea, would we? Mmm, like who for instance? (DOORBELL RINGS) One second. Hi! Hi, Elise. I said I'd stop by. Oh, I hope I didn't wake you, darling. No. Why, it's good you can sleep through. Sleep's such a good tonic, don't you think? Yeah. Morning, Elise. Don't believe everything you see. Oh, it's none of my business. You're right. Uh, excuse me while I make some more coffee. JEFF: Knowing Raymond, he probably didn't leave much. ELISE: Well, yes. I know, of course, that Raymond had a tendency to live on the edge, but... Well, I just want to be sure that you're taken care of, Laura. Well, you know Raymond. Left me with a stack of bills and nothing to pay them off with. I'll take care of whatever is necessary until you get settled. Thanks, Elise. Now, you must excuse me, I really have to be going. Oh, Jeff, we do have an appointment, don't we? Goodbye, Laura darling. (DOOR CLOSES) JEFF: Did you ever get the feeling her husband died just to get away from her? (LAUGHING) I got to go. You gonna be okay? Yeah. We'll see you later? If you like. I like. (SQUAWKING) (ENGINE STARTING) Shoot. (TIRES SQUEALING) (BOAT ENGINE REVVING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (HINGES CREAKING) RAMIREZ: Any word from Laura Keaton? We... We've been trying to reach her all day. But there's no answer. So? We're on our way over to visit her right now. Personally. Father, I put my trust in you, but time grows short. Let me assure you, as a man of the cloth. I always get a full confession. Good. Make it memorable for all of us. (EXHALES) Let's get going. (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, what a good girl. That's what I should be doing. Oh, hi. What are you doing here? Well, I wanted to know if you could take care of this for a while. Sure. What is it? Some jewelry I had hidden from Raymond. Now I have to sell it to pay off our debts. Why are you giving it to me? I was followed today. Last night my house was broken into. I don't feel safe having anything of value around. God, you're kidding! Why didn't you call the police? I did. They couldn't do anything because, I don't know, nothing was stolen and I couldn't identify the guy. I don't know. I feel... Really? Look, why don't I just call this private eye friend of mine? He owes me a few favors. Boy, I could use a favor. Oh! Come on. There's a spare leotard in the changing room. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I got to run, really. So do I, to keep this girlish figure. Well, why don't you try eating less? Hey, come on. Listen, um, if that P.I. calls or you get a hold of him, you'll let me know? Yeah. I'll call again in a minute. All right. And I'll be by to pick that up tomorrow, okay? Uh-huh. Don't worry, they're safe with me. Look, um, you just tell me if you need a few bucks, okay? You're a doll, thanks. You bet. See you later. Call me. (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) CURT: Put the phone down! No! (SOBBING) What do you want from me? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello? JEFF: Laura? Jeff. What's the matter? Jeff, there's somebody in my house. Are you sure? Yes, God damn it, I'm sure. Okay, okay, I'm on my way. (DIAL TONE) (SOBBING) Thank God. Someone's destroyed your house, Mrs. Keaton. I think he's still here. No, no. I'm sure he'll leave the moment he knows that you're not alone. Look, you wait here and I'll go check. All right? All right? You wait right there. There, there, I'm sure it's going to be okay. Father Weston will take care of everything. Look, I'm sure it'll be fine. Just come here and sit down and rest until I get back. NADINE: Let me get the chairs. No, I'll do it. You didn't get hurt, did you? No. NADINE: How upsetting. Did you see anyone, Father? No. Whoever was here, they... They've gone. Now just tell me, is anything missing? Did you have any valuables? No, nothing valuable. Is there, uh, something or some reason you came by here? Oh, well... (CHUCKLES) Yes, of course there was. But, um, it just doesn't seem very important now. The fact is that, uh, Sister Nadine and myself, we're, uh... We're in charge of the monthly bulletin at our... At our parish. And, uh, we really want to do something for Mr. Keaton, a tribute. For Raymond? Yes. This is all Father Weston's idea. LAURA: Why? Well, I mean, Raymond hasn't been in church since we were married. Ah, see, you're obviously unaware that, uh, Mr. Keaton made many generous but anonymous donations to our church. Well, I didn't know. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, well, at any rate, uh, what we really came by for was a, uh... A photograph of him that we could use for our article. Oh, sure. Uh, I have to go upstairs to get it. (SIGHS) Go on. Look around. All right, all right. Sister? Oh, there you are. That's perfect. Oh, so glad you could find it, Mrs. Keaton. Ah, well, our mission's accomplished. Uh, so, if it's all right, we'll be on our way. Oh, no, it's fine. Thanks for everything. MYRON: We'll be preparing the article this week and hopefully, it'll be in the very next bulletin. NADINE: We'll send you a copy. You're sure you'll be all right here on your own? Yes, thank you. Somebody's coming by. Peace be with you. MYRON: If there's anything you need at all, just call. Thank you. You're an asshole, Myron. Ramirez isn't going to like this, not one little bit. "Many generous but anonymous donations." (SIGHS) And, "Might we have a snapshot?" What do we need a snapshot for? What else did you want me to say in there? The place has been torn apart already. Someone's beaten us to that. What's more, I don't even think she has the stone. Well, if she doesn't have it, somebody else does. And it ain't us. You know, if someone else has the stone, they have to come to us first. Ramirez isn't about to get his hands dirty. We have someone working for us. (TIRES SQUEALING) Laura! Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. The house isn't fine, but I'm fine. You said somebody else was here. Yeah, well, he left. Boy. They sure turned this place over, didn't they? I don't know what he was looking for. Do you? No. Don't lie to me, Jeff! I'm tired of being lied to! I'm followed, I'm threatened, my house was ransacked! I don't have a goddamn cent in the bank, but I got a stack of bills a mile high. Now, somebody knows something I don't, and I think it's about time I found out. Now talk to me, damn it! They're after a stone. A stone? A gem. The kind people kill for. What has that got to do with me? Raymond. That statue Raymond stole, it was worthless. But the one eye was a priceless jewel, and Raymond took that with him. So everybody thinks I have the stone. Do you? Is that what you want from me, too, Jeff? Oh, God! I care for you. Right. Yeah, right. Damn it! No, that's right. I don't care for you. That's right, I don't care for you. I drove like a maniac because I was afraid you were hurt. Because I was afraid for you. Does that sound like I don't care? Laura? I'm sorry. (HORN HONKING) I'm changing. Oh, Jesus Christ! (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) MYRON: You care to join me in a martini, my dear? I'd love one. MYRON: I think we'll both fit. (SCOFFS) MYRON: Where'd you put those olives, huh? Oh, I found them. I don't know how anyone stands to wear these things. Faith. They have faith. Faith might move mountains, but it'll never make me like this. I don't know, I kind of like you as a nun. It's a habit I'd like to get into. Uh, well, I wish you would. And soon. Must be Tuesday. So tell me, what's going to happen if Ramirez tries to deal direct? Would you stop worrying? It's not gonna happen. We're going to pick up a nice bit of change on this thing, and finally retire. Would you hurry up with that drink? I'm suffocating! (STRUGGLING) Oh, hey, listen. I checked and that storefront in Santa Fe is still available. You know, 20,000 down for a five-year lease, with an option to buy. I know this bores you. Just think how nice it'll be to get away from this racket once and for all. Wouldn't it be strange to actually be involved in something legit? All right, just think about it, will you? Okay. All right. Are you ready for evening devotionals? I've got a new prayer position for you. I'm going to propose a toast to two new shopkeepers in Santa Fe. Hey, hey, hey... Hi. Hi. Hey, Myron, what's the hurry? WOMAN: I wish he'd move out. Bugs the hell out of me. Vicky? Vick? Vicky? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. (PANTING) Police. There's... There's been an accident. RAMIREZ: I'm taking a chance meeting you like this, Myron. MYRON: I need more money. The price of the stone has gone up. How close are you to getting it? I'll get it. You don't seem to understand, Myron. I've already paid you a bonus. You've had more than enough time. I can see I'll have to take matters into my own hands. Now get lost. Just like that? Fifteen years I stooge for you, dress up as a priest for you, and just like that, it's over? (SNAPS FINGERS) Just like that. You can't do this to me. Not now. Personally, I think I'm being very generous. You can keep your advance. (ENGINE STARTING) And you're still in excellent health. (DOOR CLOSES) Yes, I'll tell Mrs. Keaton. Thank you. Goodnight. What did the detectives have to say? Oh, not much. Not much, that's it? (EXHALES) It wasn't an accident, was it? No, it wasn't. I don't understand. If they were after a stone, why'd they take my jewelry? Why Vicky? I don't know. (SIGHS) Maybe to make the police think it was a robbery. NEWSCASTER: Nadine Weston was found strangled today in her home in North Hollywood. Her husband, Myron Weston, was seen running from the home prior to the discovery of the body. He is being sought by police for questioning. The Westons were sentenced to eight years imprisonment for gem smuggling in Florida in 1977. And now the weather. What is it? Those people were here today. And they were at the funeral. Are you sure? Why, yes. I mean, it all fits. The names, everything, the gem smuggling. Who are they? I don't know. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi, Laura, it's Elise. (SIGHS) Hi, Elise. Laura darling, why don't we have lunch tomorrow? Why lunch? Mmm, just to have a talk. I've got a few ideas of how I might help you through the next few months. Listen, I've hired a new chef, and I really think you should try his pasta. We can talk. So I'll see you tomorrow in my restaurant at 1:00. Goodbye. (DIAL TONE) Laura. Laura, look at me. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay, I promise. It's hard. I know, I know. Excuse me, are you finished? Yes, thanks. And two coffees, please. Sure. So, Laura, what are you going to do now? I don't know, uh... I guess I'll go back to work. Oh, honey, you haven't been off on one of those expeditions for years! That's for a much younger type of a girl. And they're dangerous! I mean, look at Raymond. He lost an eye in one and almost lost his life in the last one. Unless, of course, you are looking for another Raymond. Exactly what is it you want to talk to me about, Elise? Your finances. They're none of your business. Raymond was the curator of my museum. As his widow, you have assumed possession of his property. And whatever Raymond did in conjunction with my business, whatever he may have returned with or without reporting, is mine. Am I making myself clear? See, I'm aware that Raymond from time to time withheld certain objects from his discoveries. Which, well, most of them I overlooked because they were minor. However, on this last trip he did bring something back which I can't afford to overlook. Do you know what I'm talking about? Go on. Then you do know what I'm talking about. Excuse me. Uh, Ms. Marlowe, there's a phone call in your office. Thank you, Scott. Think about it. I'll be right back. Mrs. Keaton, my name is Hernando Ramirez. Please put the card away. Neither of us would like Ms. Marlowe to know we've spoken. About what? Please, Mrs. Keaton, no need to play games with me. I will pay $5,000,000 for the Window Stone of Neyboth. If you have it, or, if you will come into possession of it, please call me. There'll be no questions asked. And payments will be made according to your specifications. Now, please, excuse me. (ZIPPING) Thank you anyway, Ms. Marlowe. Perhaps I can call you for your next pledge. Nice talking to you. Bye. Stupid charities, everyone wants into my wallet. Are you interested in it too, Laura? I'm a big girl, Elise. I can take care of myself. This is nothing but a bunch of trinkets. We were on the expedition, remember, Elise? We saw the stone. It's not on the boat. It's not in the house. All right. I believe you. Then who has it? For sure Kirkwood doesn't have it. He's spending all his time with Laura. Exactly. So Laura has to have it. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi, Jeff. Oh, nothing, just going through some of Raymond's papers. You know, bills, bills and more bills. You coming over? I'll come by later. I've got some business to take care of first, okay? Well, all right. Um, what about dinner? Let's eat out. I shouldn't be too long. Okay, great. I'll see you later. (SIGHS) Hmm. "Raymond Keaton, Jeff Kirkwood, "Harley Thornton, Curt Slate "and Francesca Slate." Hello, Jeff. Elise. Why don't you sit down? What are we celebrating? Success. Really? Really. I'm not in the mood for games, Elise. So why did you ask me here? I thought perhaps you and I could make a deal. I don't make deals. I'm not Raymond Keaton. (SCOFFS) Thank God, I'm not Laura, either. (DOORBELL RINGING) FRANCESCA: Watch out! MYRON: Get her! CURT: Quick, stop her! Oh, God! CURT: Hurry, I'll get the car! (GRUNTING) Let go of me! Okay, Jeff, I'll make the offer as attractive as possible. You and me will split everything in half. And you'll never have to work another day in your life. I can't persuade you, can I? Make the call. (PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. Hello. We've got Laura. Good. I'll send Kirkwood. You know what to do. Call me back when you have some news. Kill them both if you have to. Jeff, we've got Laura. Do you want to reconsider? Where is she? She's really getting to you, isn't she? Where is she? Don't threaten me, Jeff. She's at my warehouse. If you've hurt her, or you're lying to me... Jeff! Does she really think you're different than Raymond? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GUN COCKING) CURT: Francesca! God. CURT: Francesca! Take it easy. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Francesca? She's dead, Slate. (GUNSHOTS) Kirkwood! (GROANS) Son of a bitch. (GUNSHOT) (GROANING) (SOBBING) Oh, God! (SHUSHING) (SHUSHING) Come on. MYRON: It's kind of dead tonight. We're not open tonight. We had a private party earlier. Yeah, I noticed. Very private. I see. That looks good. Get a glass. So, what did you say your name was, Mr... Weston. Ah, yes. We're both after the same thing, Ms. Marlowe. You know, I could have followed Jeff Kirkwood. But, uh, I don't know, given the choice, uh... I always go with the smart money. Me? In this case, yeah. Also, given a choice between you and, uh, Laura Keaton, you win again, partner. Mmm-hmm, partner. Right down the middle? Fine. But we have to get it first. Yeah. You're the smart one, Ms. Marlowe. But you need me to actually get ahold of it, because you really don't like to get your own hands dirty, do you? Right down the middle. Fine. Are we going somewhere? To get it, of course. Would you pass me those car keys? They're by the cash register. Pass me the keys, Mr. Weston. (GUNSHOT) Ugh. Thank you. Damn burglars. Laura, you've got to tell me everything you know. I have. Who else approached you besides Elise and those people in the warehouse? Nobody! Except this, uh, Mexican guy who talked to me when I was having lunch with Elise today. Ramirez? Yeah, yeah, that's his name. He's one of the biggest gem buyers in the world. He was probably gonna buy the stone from Raymond. Jeff, who are the priest and the nun? (SIGHS) I don't know. They probably work for... For Ramirez. He'd never deal direct. Laura, listen, do you have any idea where Raymond might have hidden that stone? No. (SIGHS) Ramirez called it the Window Stone of... ...Neyboth. Well, what does that mean? (SIGHS) Neyboth was a powerful god. Supposedly, the tribal chief could... ...look into the statue's eye for guidance. You know, uh, the eye is a window to the soul. Oh, my God! What? It's in his eye. What? The stone is in Raymond's glass eye. So that's how he got it out. That perverse son of a bitch always thought he was a God. He cut the stone so it would fit in his eye! Where are you going? To get it. You can't just go dig him up! Just leave it alone! Laura, this is our chance, believe me. Just stay here. Don't leave. I'm gonna take care of everything. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (ENGINE STARTING) So you made it out, Harley. Yeah, I made it. I was your guide, remember? Oh, I remember a lot of things. Like this, uh, ring, for instance. I also recall that, uh, you don't swim, Harley. (GRUNTS) (GUN PLOPS IN WATER) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Harley! (SCREAMING) Help me. (GROANING) Help me, Jeff! Help me! Help! (GROANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (PHONE RINGING) JEFF: This is 876-6473. Please leave a message after the beep. (BEEPS) WOMAN: This is Air Mexico regarding the reservations for Mr. Jeff Kirkwood and Ms. Elise Marlowe on Flight 10 to Mexico City. The flight has been canceled due to bad weather. Please call reservations for information. Thank you. Hello. Hello? All right, Ramirez, now you're gonna deal with me. WOMAN: Good evening. Air Mexico. Yes. I'd like to book a reservation on the first flight to Mexico City in the morning. (GRUNTING) (CLANGING) (GLASS SHATTERING) Truly beautiful. It's a shame Harley couldn't swim. Now, hand that over. Elise, come on. Drop the gun. I gave you a chance. Two airline tickets to Mexico. Now, hand that over. All right. (GRUNTS) (GUNSHOT) Oh, no. Don't! Oh! No, no. No! Jeff, no! Please, stop! Jeff. Jeff! Oh! No! ELISE: Jeff, open up! Jeff, I'm sorry! Jeff! (BANGING ON CASKET) Jeff! Jeff! Don't leave me in here, Jeff! Jeff, come back! No! (ELISE SCREAMING) ELISE: Oh! Help! Help! (BANGING ON CASKET) (GROANS) Damn you, Raymond! (SAD POP MUSIC PLAYING)
