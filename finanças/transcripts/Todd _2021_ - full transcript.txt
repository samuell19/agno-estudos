- Good afternoon, Todd, how are you? How are you today? - I'm okay, I suppose and you? - I'm good, thank you, can you have a seat while I tell Dr. Miller that you're here? Over there? - Yeah, sure. - Yes, Helen? - Doctor, Mr. Platt is here to see you now. - Oh, send him in, please. - All right, anything else? - No, that'll be it, Helen, let's just hope this last hour goes by quickly. - All right then, I will send him in. Mr. Platt, the doctor is ready for you. - I just sat down. Fine. - Hello, Todd. How are we doing today? Why don't you take a seat? - I'd be lying to you if I told you I was doing fine. - Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's been going on since our last visit? - Well, those meds you prescribed me are causing me some weird side effects. - Really, how so? You're taking the Xanax as prescribed, right? - Yes, I'm taking them as prescribed, it just feels like I have no drive, no ambition. - Well, we can change up the meds to something with less side effects. You had mentioned last time that you were searching for a job. How's that coming along? - Nothing. Been sending out my resume. Tried to land a job at a photo lab. I'd settle for anything right now, anywhere right now. - There's no shame in that, is there, Todd? - No, I'm just getting tired of rejection. - Sometimes we have to do whatever it takes to get by. Just hang in there. With both of your parents being deceased, they provided you with an inheritance, right? - Well, that's almost gone. Been living off that money. Not sure that that matters to you, though. - There's no shame in that, Todd, that's what they would've wanted for you. Though I think it's the tragic way that they died that hurts and affects you most. - I was in my mid 20s when my parents were killed in that car crash. They were on their way to pick me up from work. It was my birthday. We were gonna go and celebrate. Yeah, it hurts, doctor. It hurts every single day, I mean, what do you want me to say? - It was a horrible way they perished. You have every right to be feeling the way that you do. But life goes on, Todd. - I know life goes on, Doctor, the problem is that I've just had trouble fitting in. From grade school up until college, I just, I feel like I'm the invisible man. Nice, right? - That's why you've got to get a job and try socializing. At least maybe with a job you can mingle with your coworkers. I think I'm gonna get you started on Lexapro. I think that'll help you with your drive issues and then you can take the Xanax only when absolutely necessary. - All right, I'll try it. Are there any meds out there that can help me land a job? - That one you're gonna have to figure out on your own, I'm afraid. Don't give up, okay? - I suppose. Something positive better happen soon. - Get the prescription filled. Start in on it and I'll have Helen call you in a week. - Okay, Doctor. - I'll see you tomorrow, Helen. - 'Kay, see you. - Seriously? God, you came out of nowhere. - Yeah, window shopping? - I'm so sorry, let me help, okay? Is there anything I can do? - No, I don't think so. Oh, jeez. - Well, yeah, you're right, I was window shopping. I'm really sorry about that. I'm gonna be late for work so as long as you're sure everything's all good? - Yeah, you just keep your head up on the way to work, okay? - Well, bye, have a nice rest of your day. - Yeah, you too. It's a waste of time, I think with a doctor who dislikes me. Why should he like me? Nobody else does so why should he, right, Todd? What does it matter anyhow? We're on our own in this world. Alone and in free fall mode with no parachute. Been that way our whole life, right, buddy? That's all right, one day everyone's gonna see. See that I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody, just watch me. - Ashley, what's this I hear about one of your teachers being recognized for outstanding achievement by the National Teacher's Association? - That's right, it's Mr. Russo, my math teacher. There's a special assembly on Friday for him. - How nice. Richard, isn't that wonderful? One of your daughter's teachers being given a prestigious award. - It's great. A high school teacher's being recognized by his peers. Other high school teachers. - Whatever a person does well, they have good reason to be proud of it. - Daddy, why can't you be more enthused? I mean if it was me getting the award, would you say the same thing? - Well, if it was you getting an award, I'd be very proud of you. - I don't know Dad, you make me wonder. - Oh, honey. - I don't need you to speak for me, Kate. - I was just... - I know what you were trying to do and don't. Some guy that can't afford to own his own home is being rewarded for his efforts is all that that is. Am I right? - Daddy, why don't you care? - You know, I could've dined in the city tonight, alone. That way I would've been able to finish my meal in peace. Congratulations to your teacher at school, Ash. I'll be downstairs. - Wow. What crawled up his butt and died? - Dad cares, he's just been really busy with work lately. Your Dad loves you, don't ever forget that. - For once I'd like to hear it coming from him, Mom not you. I know that you love me, Dad, I'm not so sure of anymore. I can't do any better than I am at school at the moment. What does he want from me, blood? - Some people just have a harder time showing it than others, babe. Your father loves you very much. - Whatever, Mom, I'll try and stay out of his hair. - Richard, we're talking now. - You know, there's something soothing about watching television alone, Kate. - You know your daughter had nothing to do with that business at dinner, Richard. - Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, Kate. Did you ever think about that? - Richard, please stop it, stop acting like this. Your daughter adores you. - And I love her too, what do you want me to say? - Show her, can you tell her you love her? Is it so hard? - You know I'm not a lovey dovey type person. You should know how hard it is for me to speak about or show my emotions. - And I am not asking you to show me, show Ashley. She needs to hear it from you, she needs to hear it and feel it from you, Richard. - We about done? - Oh, we're done. Order up, girls. - Coming. What can I get you, sir? - Hey, Ames, get a load of that guy sitting alone over there. - Where? I think I know him, actually. - Really? - Mm hm. - How? Jeez, Ames, you sure keep some strange company these days. - Okay, one second, sir. No, okay, remember the guy I told you about? The one that I ran into in front of the window? - Oh, yikes. - Yup, that's him. - Well, guess you better get to it. - Really, not right now. - Yup, it's your table. - Hi, what can I get you? Excuse me, sir? - You bump anyone lately? - No, not lately. Again, I'm really sorry about that. It's all my fault, so what can I get you? - Just a glass of water, thanks. - Water and anything else? - No, just water. - That's it? Come on, don't you want a burger or something? - No, just water. - All right, yeah, I'll be right back. - Okay, so what's the deal with the weird guy? - He just wants water. - Really? - Yup, one of those guys. - Oh, what a cheapskate. Look, he really shouldn't be in here if he's only gonna order water. - I know but I don't know, I kinda feel bad for him. He's not that bad looking underneath the glasses. - No, he's not that bad looking but still you gotta admit he's a little bit weird. - He is odd but seems harmless. Better get this water to him so he can leave. - Have fun! - Here you go, sir, one glass of water. Are you sure I can't get you anything else? I mean I kinda feel like I owe you for earlier. - No, thanks, the water and lemon's just fine. - Okay. But just so you know, I mean, the owner sort of frowns on patrons just ordering water. Just a heads up. - Don't worry I'll drink it real fast and I'll be on my way. - Okay, are you sure I can't get you anything? I mean I can get you anything on the menu. It'll be on me. - No, thanks. - Hey, Ames, do you see that guy sitting at the counter over there? - Okay, he's your customer. - Well, does he look familiar to you at all? - No, not really. Not bad looking, better looking if he had a beard though. - No, no, no, it just hit me a second ago. I think I saw him on TV promoting this movie he made. I think it was an action film or something like that. Well, now's your chance. - To what, talk about something I have never seen before? - No, no, no, no. Just be yourself and tell him, well, tell him that you know who he is and that your friend saw him on TV. - Order up, ladies. - And you're an aspiring actress, that's all. That's his order, if you want you can go ahead and bring it over to him. - Okay, why not, it'll be as close to Hollywood as I've gotten so far. - And hey, not like that you don't, let me fix you. Oh my goodness, okay. You look great, go get him. - Okay, we have a ham sandwich with a side of mac and cheese here for you, sir. - What happened to the other girl? - Oh, she's just about to clock out so I'm covering for her. I could have her to come back and fill your coffee. - No, no, no, no, that's okay, honey but you, looks like, I don't know, maybe you've done some modeling or something, I mean just from your figure. - Oh, yeah, I've done modeling locally. Still do from time to time. - Let me guess, you wanna be an actress too, right? - I mean what model doesn't dream of being an actor or actress? - True, true but what are the odds? A million, two million to one? - Yeah but for me, it's a chance I'd like to take. You know, I've done lots of theater. Cast as a lead in most. - I'll tell you what, why don't you go back and get that pot, come and fill up my coffee and you and I will talk a little bit more, how's that sound? - Okay. - Sound good? - Yeah. - Good, good. - My name is Amy, Amy Westcott, by the way. - Hey, Amy, I'm Jack Midas, nice to meet you, sweetheart. - Nice to meet you. How is everything? - Everything's good, you know, I mean I could go anywhere and get food but this place has the best sandwiches and food ever. - Right? I mean I'm told that this food made the place famous over the years. Not that I'm thinking of staying here or making a career out of it. - Let me guess, you wanna be a famous movie star or something, right? - I mean, a chance to star in a film for starters. - You know what? I have something that I wanna talk to you about a little bit more, I mean I just had this thought, something that you would be perfect for, now no promises, it's just a couple of scenes in a movie, maybe a few lines but you know what? You'd be perfect, what do you say? - Really? You'd consider me for a part in a movie just like that? - Just like that. You work late? - Actually, I'm off in an hour, then I'm just heading home. - You live close? - Yeah, just a few blocks from here. - Tell you what. When you get done, you and I, let's go back to your apartment, I mean to talk about my project. I mean I don't want you to get excited, it's just a couple of lines maybe in a movie but I think you'd be perfect for it, what do you say? - Yeah. - Sound good? - Mm hm. - Good. - So, I mean are you just gonna stick around 'til the end of my shift? - Honey, that sounds like a perfect plan, I'll do that but what you're gonna do is fill this up first and then I'll wait for you, how does that sound? - Yeah. - Good. - You know, right here. - Perfect. Thank you, honey. Sexy woman. - So, did I pass the audition? - Yeah, you did good, you passed. You passed. - 'Cause you know, I can go again if you want. - That's okay, honey, I believe you, everything's good. What I need you to do, but you don't have to do, is you don't have to say anything, you don't have to talk. Just lay here with me. You did real good, honey, you did real good. Let's you and I go back to your place because I wanna talk to you, you know, about the project, because I do have something in mind I think you'd be perfect for. Couple of lines in this movie, couple of scenes. But I think it'd be perfect for you, what do you say? - So, Todd, how have you been doing since I changed your prescription? Is the Lexapro helping with the depression? - Really, I don't feel anything anymore. - What do you mean you don't feel anything? - Just what I said, zilch, voided, nothing. - Look, Todd, I am trying to help you. If you're not willing to talk to me, how can I be of any assistance to you? How is the job searching or the socialization coming? - The only socializing I've been doing is with my landlord. The past due notices I've been getting. - Well that's not good, so I'm guessing the inheritance is... - Pretty much all gone. In about six to eight weeks, I'll be on the streets if something doesn't happen soon. - Well, I guess you should be hitting the pavement a little bit harder. I'm guessing here isn't the right place for you now, Todd. - Gee, thanks, Doc, now you're just tossing me to the curb. This here, you and me, this is my socializing. - No, Todd, you don't get it. This is therapy, not socialization. Going out, mingling, meeting a woman, talking to her, that is socializing, when are you gonna get that? - I get it, all right, doctor? Listen, I'm getting the hell outta here. I don't think you or anyone else is gonna be able to help me. You are supposed to have compassion. Isn't that in the doctor's oath somewhere? All I feel is hostility coming from you now. - Well, if that's what you're feeling, Todd, then I guess we are all done here. All I can say is what I've told you over and over again. Try socializing. You know what, I'm not gonna be able to write you any more prescriptions. - Doesn't matter, didn't do me any good anyhow. - Guy's got fuckin' problems. - I am so sorry, so sorry. - Do this here for you, Doc. - Thank you, Jake, you always come to the rescue. - Glad to be of service. - No music tonight? - No, the musician got sick. - I was looking forward to hearing some Billy Joel or Queen. - Or maybe some Barry White maybe. It's all about love. - Not bad, Jake, not bad. - You're quite the music aficionado, I see. - Yes, I am and you? - I love music. All of it but my favorite's jungle music. The primal sounds, the pounding of the beat. Rhythm and motion. You know, the call of the wild. Have somewhere to be? It's still early, hon, have another with me? - So you submit to the call of the wild? - I do, don't you? - I've been known to a time or two. I didn't catch your name. - No names, sweetie. It's meaningless for me right now. - So we shall remain anonymous. - I think it's best, just the two of us together. All night. What's in a name anyway? - There's a lot to be said about a name, take Elvis. - I love his music, especially A Little Less Conversation. - Madam, it's been a delightful crossing of paths. May you find your king. - Ah, a family to get home to. - You caught me. A husband and a father. It's like two ships passing in the night, continuing on their journey. - Goodnight, baby. - Goodnight, darlin'. - See you in my dreams. - Can't sleep? - What's the matter? Can't come home at a decent hour anymore? - I know it's late, I've had a bad day. I lost a patient due to me being aloof or something. I don't know. - You don't know but you needed to drink. - Yes, Kate, I needed a fucking drink. I needed time to decompress. What's the big deal? - The big deal is that I am not going to allow your abusiveness towards me any longer and especially not towards your daughter, Richard. - What the hell are you talking about, I have never abused you and God knows I have never abused Ashley. What is your problem? Why don't you enlighten me, Kate, on your master wisdom? - Okay, so you were obviously out tonight. Where were you? Who were you with? You reek of liquor. - What is this? I am exhausted and I am in no mood for an inquisition at this hour, we can talk about this tomorrow. - No, we're gonna talk about it right now or I am getting Ashley and I am leaving you, Richard. You have alienated us to the point where I don't even know you anymore, do you even realize that? Your daughter loves you so much and all you can do is find fault or feed her some droll antidote to avoid communicating with her. - I have always been there for you and Ashley, you know that, sometimes with my practice, things get a little rocky but we've always managed, no? I'm just going through a rough time right now, that's all. - A rough time? - Yeah. - You mean like the rough time the other night? You threw a temper tantrum and left the dinner table. - Oh, stop that, Kate, I was just being sarcastic in my humor and besides, if the shoe fits... - Richard, your daughter looks to you for acceptance and guidance and what do you do? You shoot her down. Richard, please, not for me, for Ashley, you need to reach out to her now before you lose her and you are going to lose her forever, mark my words. - Get off my back, Kate, go to bed and we will talk about this tomorrow. - Things have to change! Things have better change! - How could you? How could you, Daddy? I know you don't have time for us anymore or care about us but I didn't know you could be this mean. I hate you, how could you? How could you be this cold, I hate you! Do you think he's seeing someone else? Another woman, maybe? - Ash, what you saw was your mother letting your father know that his behavior around here has to change. There's no other woman. - But I hear you hollering about leaving and taking me away from here, I don't wanna leave our home. - I know, I know. I was really angry with your father right now for coming home so late. That's what the yelling's about. That and the fact that he's been acting poorly around here. Especially with you. - I just don't get it. He acts like we're both not even here sometimes. And I know that's how Daddy is, he can't show his feelings but the hurtfulness? - I won't tonight, Ashley. There's been too much hurt around here lately and that's why I confronted Daddy. I had to remind him what he has and what he stands to lose. Do you understand that? - Lose us, you mean? - Yes. I was just trying to make him see a little clearly. Dad knows what he has, he'll come around. - I doubt anytime soon. He seems pretty drunk to me. - Yeah. He was out drinking all night. Which is rare for him, Ash. When have you ever known him to drink like that? - Never. Maybe on the occasional family picnic but never. - You're right. What it is that's truly bothering him, I don't know what it is yet but I can tell you it's not you or me, Ash, try to understand that, okay? Your Daddy loves you very much and he would do anything to protect us, of that I am very certain. - Jesus, he's gonna be feeling like crap in the morning. - Hello, Himmy. - Hi dee ho, Jake. - Hey, Doc, what's shakin'? - How you doin'? - Well, actually, you know what? I'd complain but who listens? - Ditto to that. - Yeah, man, so I been seeing you a lot lately in here. Everything okay at home? - I'd be lying to you if I told you everything was all right. I'm having some domestic issues on the home front. - Ah, issues, see, I try to avoid those, that's why I'm single. - That's why I like you, Jake, you've got a sixth sense about you. You always know what's wrong. I'm like the odd man out, like between my wife and my teenage daughter. - I can relate to that but you gotta understand, havin' one woman mad at you, that's bad enough but I can only imagine having two of 'em attacking you, that's a big no thank you for me. Damn, you know what? You need a double. One for each lady. - Salut. Yeah. - You might wanna go easy on that stuff, man, the day is young. - It's all right, I'm goin' home right after the next one. I've been distant from my patients, from my family, from my work, from my writing, from my lectures and now it's been brought to my attention that I'm aloof to the ladies at home. - Sounds like you're spreading yourself a little thin. - You might be right, Jake. I don't know, I love my family, you know that. I would jump through a ring of fire for them. I just, I don't know. When I'm home I feel like I'm just restless. - How long we know each other? - 12 years. - I've never seen you like this in 12 whole years but you've gotten through everything else. You can get through this, if you can get through today in one piece, you can get through anything but the key is get through today. - And what about tomorrow? - Well, somehow I got a feeling you'll figure that out too. I got faith in you, I got faith in him too but he never says nothin'. I think you'll be all right. You've always gotten through this, you'll get through this. Remember, get through today in one piece. - Next time, Jake. - See you later, man. Want another one? - Please. - That's the first time you've spoken to me in 12 years. Kiss my ass. - Hello? I'm okay. It was like a war zone between my parents the other day. Knock down, drag out, I watched it. Like, I stood there watching it all happen like an idiot. All I wanted to in that moment was scream and pack up my things and just get as far away from here as I possibly could. Thanks. I might take you up on that offer. I've been okay. Promise, okay, I have to be signing off because I have to get up early tomorrow and I'm just really drained, okay. I will, I promise. Okay. Okay, I'll talk to you later, bye. - Helen. - Yeah? - Something's been worrying me. Have we heard anything from Todd Platt? In a week or two, if he hasn't reached out, can we reach out to him? - Yeah. - Will you remind me? - I will. - Sarah, ready? - Got it. - Got an order for you, Harry. - Thanks. - Finally, I'm gonna be able to pay my bills today. - I can see that. Lunch shifts are the best, aren't they? So far all my customers are tipping well. - Hey, Ames, look who just walked in. Better get that ice water ready. - Now? Does he have to come now? Seriously, I'm swamped out there today. - I don't know, maybe he'll actually order some food today. Ooh, let's take bets, I say that Mr. Weirdo orders some food. - Yeah, I don't know about that. He seems pretty regimented on his whole water thing. I say he sticks with the water, Lizzy. In fact, bet you five bucks he sticks with the water. - You're on. Meatball with cheese. - Well, hello again, sir. How are you? - I'm okay and you? You bumped into anyone else, admiring that little blue dress of yours? - No, actually the blue dress is gone. Someone got to it before I could. - Oh, that's too bad, really, it would look good on you. - Thanks, maybe in another life or something. So what can I get you? - She refers to my fondness for ice water. Okay, I'll tell you what, today I'm gonna order your best lunch special. What do you got? - Oh, so you're eating today. All right, being that it's Wednesday, that would be southern pork chops with some mashed potatoes, side of garlic bread and your choice of another vegetable. - Okay, then, pork chops it'll be. Surprised you, didn't I? - Not too surprised. We all have to eat at some point, right? Okay and what to drink? - Ice water. - Water. - You know me too well. - Of course. All right, be right back. Looks like you win the bet, Lizzy. - You mean... - Yup, Mr. Weirdo actually ordered food this time. - Yay, Mr. Weirdo, I knew he could do it. - So what are my odds of getting a bigger tip? - Well, I mean he tipped you five for just water. So with food, I'd say 10 at least. - That'd be more than his order costs. I'd be happy with five bucks or you could just give me back the five bucks. - That's so not gonna happen. But sure, like five's a given but let's hope for a Hamilton. Or dare we say a Jackson. - Okay, I'm serving the guy his food, not going to bed with him. All I know is. Okay, he's a totally strange dude. Like, I don't know, he might be nice and all but the way he looks at me, it's like he's looking through me. Almost like, like I'm naked or something. - Yikes. - You have really outdone yourself today, Kate. - Why, thank you, it is improvised and I guess I got a little lucky. - Isn't that right, Ash? Hasn't your mom outdone herself? Ashley, I was just saying how your mom... - Outdid herself. I heard you the first time. Great dinner, mom. - I was just trying to compliment your mom on how good dinner was tonight. - I'm glad you guys are both enjoying it. - You know Ashley, some day soon you're gonna be having a family of your own to feed. Hello? Earth to Ashley. - Jesus Christ. - What do I gotta do to get a response from my daughter? No, Kate, let me do this. It's time for me to have a heart to heart with her. - She's being tough on you, Richard. Just let her know your feelings and it'll show. She needs you. - What's wrong, Ash? Please, Ash, tell me, what's wrong? I know Daddy's been mean and nasty lately and I'm sorry. All right. Don't talk to me then. Just know this, Ash. That no matter when, who, what or where, your Daddy loves you. He'd walk through fire for you. - Is that about it, Dad? I really need to finish this reading assignment here. - That's it then? Only that you have a reading assignment to finish? - Maybe if you acted like you enjoyed being with me. Mom too, we feel as if though we meant to you more than your patient in the snake pit. - No. No, no, honey, you and your mother come before anything, honest. I know I screwed up the other day by coming in drunk and I'm sorry, Ash, I was wrong. It'll never happen again, I promise. - I really need to finish this reading assignment and it's much more than the other night coming home drunk, okay? Is that about it? - I was hoping for more of like, hey, Daddy, I know you've been working so hard but I miss you and I love you, you know, something along those lines. - I don't think I'm ready to go there yet. There's too much distance between us, maybe if you could just amp down the drama it would make you seem more human than a machine. - Wow. I didn't think you despised me that much, Ash. I really am sorry. I'm only human. You know, sometimes in life, we wander off a bit like your Daddy has. I'm sorry. - Right now, I see that you want something that you just can't have. Imagine feeling this way over and over, day after day. How would you feel? The forgiving part's gonna take a little bit more time. - Whenever you're ready. Just as long as you can forgive me and then I'll know. - Know what? - I'll know that I have my daughter back. - Okay, Dad. Right now I see that you understand that you want something so bad, you pray for good things to happen and they never do and all you're left with is the anger and the hurt. So I hear you but I really have to finish my reading assignment. - All right. Fair enough. Oh and Ash? - What's that, Daddy? - I love you, baby girl. - I love you. - Yes, Helen? - Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I just got off the phone with Todd Platt and he sounded really upset and he wanted to schedule an appointment with you. - I've been thinking about him, what did you tell him? - Yes, I mean I just got off the phone with him and you had an opening at the end of the day so I just booked him, I hope that's okay. - Oh, that's fine, I wanted to reach out to him. - Okay, yeah, that's what I thought so I booked him. - Let's just pray everything goes okay. - All right, anything else? - No. - Hi, Mr. Cross. Is there anything wrong? - Hi there, Amy, the darnest thing. I was up here this morning and I was letting the electrician in, you know you left your door open? - No, no, no, no, I locked it this morning before I left. - Honest to goodness, ajar about an inch. I only noticed it 'cause I was up here letting the electrician in next door. Well, look, if you're nervous, I can go inside and check things out for ya. - Oh, no, it's okay, Mr. Cross, really. I'm just surprised is all. - Well, if you're sure, it's really no problem. I'd like to know that all of my tenants are doing well. - Well, thanks, Mr. Cross. I'll be okay. If that's all? - Sure thing, all right, have a pleasant evening. - Okay, you too. - Where is the good one. No, not this one. Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy. No, not this one. Come on, where's my beautiful Amy, where's that beautiful shot of mine? Not bad, not bad. That's it, yes, that's the one. Oh, yeah, Amy. Yeah. My sweet, darling Amy. Oh, you're so beautiful. Yes. I have a special, special place for you. I like that. Ah, you're beautiful, Amy. You don't know how beautiful you are, do you? I do. - Todd? The doctor's ready to see you now. - Hello, Todd. It's been some time. How are you feeling? - Not bad. I've used all the meds you prescribed me. Still can't connect a job yet. - And here I was thinking you were gonna tell me that everything's okay, the Lexapro is working and you're not taking the Xanax anymore. - That ship's sailed, Doctor, a while ago, really. - Well, it's not too late to start over. What do you say we talk for a bit? - Well, Doctor, today I would like to ask you a few questions. So, how's everything in your life? How's everything on Arbor Road? Nice area, I hear. - Why are you asking about that particular location, Todd? Is it one that you're familiar with? - Yeah, I'm familiar with it now. So, Doctor, tell me, what goes on over there at 2228 Arbor Road? - Why are you asking about my personal address, Todd? I'm just wondering. - No particular reason, just feeling nostalgic, I guess. All that time away from you perhaps. - I'm here to help you, this is your time. What can I help you with, Todd? - And I'm asking you. You, Doctor, how is everything on Arbor Road? How's it going? - Everything is fine, Todd, on Arbor Road. How's everything in your neighborhood? You know, Todd, I'm thinking that the medications had a negative effect on you. - Is the family happy there on Arbor Road, Richard? Are they happy there? - Everything is fine, Todd. We have both our good days and our bad, you know. - All that bullshit you fed me in here and I ask you a question, a simple question, really and you can't give me a straight answer. - Why are you really here, Todd? You're borderlining on threats, I'm listening but would you like to talk about anything other than the fact that you know where I live? - Don't worry, Doctor, I won't be coming in here ever again. - So you came all the way down here to let me know you know where I live. - Something like that, come on, Doctor. You know what I'm getting at here. - No, I don't, Todd, why don't you tell me what you're getting at here. - Maybe if you pretended to try to treat me from the very beginning, perhaps things would've turned out a little different or no, doesn't matter anyway. - You know, Todd, I have never pretended in anything in treating you, though I'll admit that my disposition may be intimidating and for that I am very sorry but my only aim is to help you, son. - Well, we all need to watch after our own, Dr. Richard Miller of 2228 Arbor Road. By the way, thanks for taking me on such short notice. Don't worry. I won't be coming here ever again. - Hi, Amy. I hope I didn't bother you, letting myself in like this. I know you've been so busy. So, how's work? - Oh, my... - I brought you this red rose. Symbolizes our love for each other. You know, two hearts beating as one. Ours. - How did you get in my place? - I thought I'd surprise you. You know, a little surprise. Are you surprised, Amy? - How do you know my name? Okay, you've broken into my place. I'm calling the police. - No, no, Amy, I just, I wanna have a little romantic evening tonight, just you and me, just the two of us. - Get off of me. - Hey. - Get off of me, you crazy bastard! - Calm down, relax. Relax. I got you something. You're gonna like it. You wanna see, huh? Come on, let's go, come here. Come on, let's go see it. Come on. - No! - Come on, stand there and don't move. - Put the phone down. Turn around. Face me. Now take off your shirt. Wait, before you do. You're gonna put this on. Yeah, that'll look nice on you. What do you say, you wanna put it on? Now, take off your clothes. Shirt. Do it! - Okay, okay. - There you go. This shouldn't be too hard, right? Very good. Yeah, now, your shorts. Take those off too. Take off your shorts now. - Okay. - There, see, that's not so hard. Now we can have a little fun and play some dress up. All right, let's get this beautiful dress on you. Let's see, okay, there's the back. Let's put this on, now how do you ladies put this on? That's it, over your head like this, yeah. There you go, right through the hole, oh, perfect. Yeah, beautiful, beautiful. You're beautiful. You feel good? I know that I am feeling very good right now. Come here, let's dance. Let's dance. Come on now, let's dance. - Why are you doing this to me, why? You wanna just kill me? You wanna kill me? - No. - Come on, go ahead, fucking do it! Fucking do it. - Why, why would I wanna kill the woman I love? I love you, Amy, I don't wanna hurt you. Why would I do that? - Who are you? Who are you? - You don't remember who I am? Really? Come on. How soon you forget. Remember me now? - My stalker. - Yeah, Todd. Todd Platt. I ran into you in the department store. You remember me, come on, I remember you. - Stop it. - Yeah. - What you've just done is breaking and entering, okay? I really think you need help. - I just wanted to give you the roses and the dress, that's it. - Okay, okay, okay, Todd. I'm asking you one last time. Leave my apartment. You need help. - Help? No! Help. Help, that's been more of a hindrance to me. I've been getting help for a very, very long time now. You don't know and you don't care, do you? - I have no idea what you're talking about. All I know is I've been your server a few times at the diner that's it and I ran into you in front of the window. - He was supposed to help me. Help me deal with the losses and help me move on in life and he used me, he used me and now he made me feel like a fool. You're doing the same thing. You're turning on me like this. - No, no, no, no. - You're not gonna turn on me, are you, Amy? - I'm not turning on you, I'm not turning on you, okay? All I know is what I just told you. Other than that, Todd, I don't know you. I don't know you. I swear. - But you love me, don't you? You love me, don't you, Amy? Say it. Say it! You love me, don't you? - Oh, no, stop it! - You love me, don't you? - Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it. - You love me, don't you? You love me, don't you? - Stop it! I don't know you. - Sorry. I'm sorry, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's over now. This much I'm certain of. She and I will never be. Who was I kidding anyhow? I must let her go now. Let her go so that I can concentrate on the person who truly failed me the most. Out of everyone. A score I've needed to settle now for some time. He needs to learn now. You embarrass me. Your mom and dad waiting for you in there? Well you're gonna ring the doorbell so they can let you in. Ah, you're pretty agreeable. I like that quality. I have nothing against you or your mom but your dad on the other hand, yeah. - What, what on the other hand? - I have some unfinished business to settle with him, let's just say. - I see the gun in your pocket. Are you here to kill my father? - Which one gets us in unnoticed? - This one let's you into the garage and the downstairs rec room. - Rec room. That sounds fun, come on, let's go surprise your father. Unlock it. What a beautiful home you have here. Where's your dad? Point. Let's go. - Ash is home. - It's a little late, isn't it? - Open the door slowly. - Oh. - Oh, hi, mom. - Please. - Get back slowly. - Please don't hurt my girl. - Come on, come on. - Please. - Let's go. - What can I do for you? - Back. - What's going on with all that noise? Ashley, Ashley! Todd. What are you doing, Todd? - Hey, Doc, what a nice surprise. Just happened to be in the neighborhood, you know? You're a very lucky man, Doctor. Two beautiful ladies like this in your life. Yeah, Doctor, I'm so impressed with the ladies that you have in your life, maybe they'll understand when I order you to make amends here tonight, Doctor. You, Doc, time to come clean. Go sit next to your Mrs. - Todd. - Now. - Why all this, huh? - Sit down! - Why, why all this? Please tell me. What do you want, son? - Doc. - What made you wanna find out where I live? - Doc, had I known the beautiful ladies you had in your life, I woulda come here sooner. - Who are you, how dare you bring a gun into my home? - Mom, he's nuts, what are you saying? - No, honey, mom's right, how dare I? How dare I rain on your parade? - Richard, I never thought your work would ever become our family's worst nightmare, who is this person and what is he doing here, tell me. - His name is Todd. It's Todd Platt. He's a patient of mine since his parents got killed in a car crash two years ago and I've been treating him up until recently, isn't that right, Todd? - All true. Sit down. Sorry, Doc, the medications weren't doing it for me and I had to cut you loose and now that everybody here know my name, tell me yours. - Her name is Ashley and I am Kate, her mother. - Honey. - Oh, starting to disapprove? - Don't give him the satisfaction. - Satisfaction, towards me, you mean, Richard? Satisfaction? Is that like justice? No, no, I got it, maybe it's like revenge. I don't know. Not really sure anymore, Doctor. - What do you want, Todd? In my office there's a safe behind the picture on my wall. Is that what you want, you want money, Todd? - I don't want your money, Doc. As for Kate and Ashley here, I don't to hurt them either. - So it's something from me that you want. - You're getting warm now, Doc. What could I possibly want from you? After all the bullshit, all the condescension, all the talking down to you fed me in that office. Maybe an apology is in order. - Is that what you want, Todd? Just an apology and then you'll go and everything'll be all forgiven? - That all depends if you can be sincere. Tell me, Kate and Ashley. You think your father can be sincere? Does he have any left in him? I wonder did he have any to begin with? - I'm sorry, Todd. I'm sorry that I failed you as a medical professional. - Sit down! - I'm sorry that I failed you as a medical professional. I just wanna help you if you let me, son. - Had a nice little touch of fear in it, Doc. Nice try, really, really nice try. Come on, Doc, what else you got for me? Maybe Kate and Ashley have some apologies due to them! Come on, let's all come clean and be baptized here this evening. - Well, it seems to me, you are the only person seeking that apology from my father. - Come on, Dr. Miller. You were close. So close that I almost believed you. Try again. I trusted you. I trusted you! Your family is your saving grace tonight. Here I am, lord. I failed as a man. I know that much. But I wanna ask you why. Why did you take my family from me? Why? Why have I been the invisible man my whole life? Why me? I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who to trust. I don't know who to turn to. Look at you, so beautiful you are. No matter how hard I tried, I could never make you love me. Love me, you never even noticed me. I understand it now. I made a fool out of myself in front of everyone like the loser that I am. All that I ever wanted was to be liked, that's it, nothing more. It just, it just wasn't meant to be. Not meant to be. - Hey. - Hey. - So how are you doing? After the break in and everything. - Honestly, I can't believe that I didn't call the police. I mean this guy, he could've raped, murdered, chopped me into little pieces, Lizzy. - I can't believe you didn't either. Why? Was it because of that note the weirdo left you? - Yeah. That note. It was, he was just so sad. Like I knew something was wrong. But had he not left that note, I would've called 9-11. That's the only thing that kept me from doing it. - Ames, we knew that much from the way he would sit there brooding all the time, only ordering water. Plus he had that weird look in his eyes. He was a real creep. - Yeah, that day, there was just, there was something different. Like I could tell that something was wrong. That note, it was just so, it was so sweet and sad. It's not like something you and I haven't felt before. But had he not left it, I would've called the police. I mean I had the phone ready in my hand. What was I thinking? I mean what if he just killed me right there? - That's what I mean, I mean you don't how lucky you were. I mean he could have killed you and left you for dead. - I know. You would think after that big audition with that movie producer, which I totally screwed up, I would've learned not to trust anyone. I can't help it. - Hey. - It's just how I am. - I know. All I'm saying is that you are one very lucky girl. I for one, I'm just glad that you're okay. - This is hard. - What, what's hard? - Telling you that I'm leaving for California in two weeks. - What, are you kidding me? I mean that's great. - I was thinking about what you said and I just wanna try. I wanna actually go out there and see if I have what it takes to act. - God, I'm, I'm gonna miss you around here. Damned if I don't think you're doing the right thing though, 'cause I know you are. - But I want you to come out and visit me. - Of course, I'd love that. You know, I've always wanted to visit the Grauman's Chinese Theater. You know, see all the movie stars' hands and footprints. - It'll be a good step for sure. - Damned if I don't think you're doing the right thing though, 'cause I know you are. - Thanks. - What happened? Huh, what happened, Todd? You should still be alive. Such a young man to die so soon. I know that in your mind that you always felt slated by my mannerisms. For that I'm sorry. If I'd only saw it closer how much help you actually needed, more perhaps than I probably could've given. For that I'm sorry, Todd. I've changed. I've changed, Todd. Maybe when you're older, you'll understand why I chose to keep his ashes. I've decided to put the urn in my office on the bookshelf. As a reminder. - A reminder? - What your Dad is saying is sometimes we need a reality check and it's a reminder of what's important to him. - The ashes, they remind me never to take anything or anyone for granted. It'll help me listen, truly listen and help me read between the lines, you know? - You're a good doctor and a great father to me, Dad. I'm sorry for any bad attitude I had. - That day, when I almost lost you both, that made me realize how important you both are to me and I prayed to God to get us out of that mess and he did and I promised him that I'd be a better father and a better husband. He's given me a second chance and I don't wanna screw that up. I love you. - I love you. Okay, nevermind. - Hey, stranger. - Hey. Don't do that, you said you wouldn't. - I made no promises. Promise me you'll be careful, okay? - As long as you come visit me. - Of course I promise, I will, I will. I guess I should, I should be getting back. - Me too. - You're gonna do so good out there. Get outta here.
