Please, no, no! No! Please! Please, God, help me. Bubble, bubble... toil and trouble. - No... No. Please, let me go. - No. What utter nonsense. No. No, no, no. Please! Please, I'll do anything! I'll do anything! Please, help. No, no, no, please help. No! No! My eyes! My eyes! My eyes. My eyes. Welcome, my darklings. My name's Morella... and this is... Verotika. Oui. That's it. Don't stop. Ah, that's it. Yeah, come up here. Oui. Hey. - Wait. - Oui. Wait, no. Leave my shirt on. - Ah. - Please. No. - Wait. - Ah. No. Wait! No! Yes. Wait. - No! - Oui! - Wait! - What in the fuck? Your tits, they're looking at me! Don't look. Wait! Come back! Not again. Hello? Francois, is that you? Dajette? Please, my petite, no cry. He's not worth it. Mariel, it happened again. And it was all going so well. Then he's an insensitive prick. Good riddance! I know, you are right, but he was so cute. They're all cute. You will make your eyes puffy for your photo shoot tomorrow. The shoot? I forgot! If you need anything, I'm right down the hall, honey. Goodnight. I will be just fine. Dajette... Only I... truly love you. Only I... know your pain. Sleep, my Dajette. For when you sleep, when you dream, it is then, only then that I am free... to roam. Sleep, Dajette. Let me be real, to do... as your subconscious wills. To do... as you wish. Set me free, Dajette. Let me be real. Milk or... beer. Dajette? Dajette, is that you? Hold on, Dajette. I'm coming. Dajette... she is but a dream. Stop. No! My sweet thing. I am your only reality. Stop, you... disgusting... freak! Oh, I have only just begun, ma cherie. "Freak" is such an ugly word. A true tramp... would use... grotesque. No? Do you not fear me? No! No! Mariel. No! No! Please, let it not be real. Not my Mariel. Mariel? Mariel? Please answer. Mariel! Oh, no, Mariel! Oh... no. Mariel. Killer. Killer. Your friend... She was a lot of fun. Killer. Killer. Oh, I am hurt. You... are a murderer. Yes... I am. I am... you. Me? No. I would never do such a thing. Yes and no. That is why I must do it... for you will not. No, no! It's not true. Leave me alone! I will leave you alone. Just sleep, Dajette. Then I will go. I will go do the things that you envision in your mind. I will free what the erratic Dajette has found inside her soul. No! No! Yeah. Are you looking for some company tonight, monsieur? Monsieur! You startled me, there, in the shadows. You like what you see? You want a date, yes? Yes. I do like, mon amour, but a date is not quite what I had in mind. Pardonnez-moi. Well, then perhaps monsieur would let me know his preference? I am sure I can accommodate his tastes. Oh, I am sure you can, my cher. First, I wish to bend you over right here... and fuck you in the ass. Monsieur has good eyes. Ass-fuck is my specialty. Then, I wish to hear your neck... snap. Monsieur was only joking... yes? Wait, how many are you? Only joking? Why, yes. - Wait! - I want to hear your neck... No! Break! No! Dajette, are you okay? I was asleep, - wasn't I? - Yes. So? It was just a bad dream. Ah. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Over. Sexy. Sexy. Yes. Ah, great. Mmm-hmm. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. That is... It's very nice. Yes. This is good. Huh... Move closer. And the two... Fierce. Really fierce. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Very good. Now, sexy, sexy. Yes, yes. Yes. Ladies, ladies, can we... get on back to the photo shoot, huh? And... And you, Dajette, can I get you in the... In the scene this time? Hey, stupid, can't you see she's not feeling well? I think she's still in shock. Yes, in that dream you found your best friend dead. This is just another in a series of grisly murders. There, on the television. Their necks broken. With no leads to go on, police are still hoping. The police are calling this murderer le neckbreaker. That happened because of me. I am to blame. No. How could you be to blame, silly? You were with us all day. In fact, you were sleeping. That's how it happened. I was sleeping. Girl, you are crazy. I think you have finally lost it. Lay off. She had a bad dream. It is not a dream, you see. It is not. He lets loose when I sleep. Okay, okay, okay. The shoot is now over. Someone here make sure that she gets herself home safely. No. No one takes me home. I will be fine. No one can come with me. No one can. Okay, wow. What a psycho bitch. Well, she's upset, poor thing. You know, you are so sensitive and understanding. So, maybe you can loan me some money? Fuck off. Got to stay awake. Got to. What is this film? It is only people making sex. So only make sex. How... wonderful. It's... happening. Mmm. I don't want... to sleep. Yes... that is it. Fall asleep. Set me free. This is where she does them both. Oh, yeah. Are you sure she's asleep? Ah! She feels so good. Fantastique. I'm next, okay? Let me out! No, not yet. Don't wake up. It is too soon. No! Not yet! No, stop! No! No! Stop. No. Hey, you, come back. Shut up. How could I let this happen? Is the killer not me? Huh? Coffee. I need hot coffee. Then I can think. Madame. Madame. We are closing. Would you like another refill? Madame? Hello? Pardon? I was lost in thoughts. Non. I am leaving. Then I may suggest that one girl stay at home... for somewhere out there is the neckbreaker. I will. Merci. Le neckbreaker. If they only knew. But then, how could they? And I know what must be done. I need something to drink. Something to wash it all down. Allo? Yes. I would like to report a murder. That is the correct address, yes. Please hurry. You... You are here. Yes. You brought me back. And I was having so much fun. You know, you may as well give yourself over to me. You will have to fall asleep again, soon. You... You are... too... Too late. Too late? Too late? Sleep... for... forever. What have you done? You idiot! No, no, no, this cannot be happening! Not now! Police. Hello, hello? Open up, now. Draw your weapons. And get ready. We are going in. Let's go. Don't move, monsieur. Take your hands off her neck and move away, slowly. Hold it. That's enough. Whatever it is, it is not going anywhere. You bitch, wake up! I am dying! Wake up! The neckbreaker, he's as pale as a ghost. Looks like we found our sex murderer. Sergeant, it is too late. She is dead. So young. So sad. Oui. But the freak did not kill her. It looks like an overdose. Hmm. So strange. Sergeant, her breasts are eyes. Oui. Well, there you go, the eyes have it. That's all fine and well... but what am I supposed to do with these? Our next story. Hello? Who's there? What do you want? Your face... It's very nice. Give it to me. My face? What do you want with my face? Well, no, you can't have my... Well, if you aren't going to give it to me, then I guess I'll just have to take it from you. No. No! Now, look what you made me do. You should have just given it to me when I asked. Hey. How are you doing tonight, Murphy? I'm all right. You want a dance? Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, get ready for the Mystery Girl. Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Mystery Girl. What have you got? What we've got is grizzly, Sarge. Oh, yeah? How grizzly? Pretty grizzly. Face cut off, ear removed, no sign of any other body trauma. The cause of death... Apparent shock and loss of blood. Nice, another sicko killer. Anything else for me? Afraid not, sir, I mean, we've got nothing. Zero evidence, which means no leads or motive. Where's her face? Well, that's what I was going to get to. Is, whoever did this, just didn't... Just left with it. And left no... No trace. Nowhere to be found. No blood trail. Negatory. There's your motive. They wanted her face. Listen, man... Hello, again, my pretties. Did you miss me? How would you like some more company? I thought so. Time to be with the other sisters. Who is it? I'm in here. I didn't call maintenance today. What do you want? Hello, pretty. Collections. Collections? What do you mean "collections"? Who are you? How did you get in here? Haven't you heard? I'm the face-collector. Face-collector? I've come... to get your face. My face? No. No! No! Pretty, pretty girl. With such a pretty face. You don't mind if I borrow it for a while, do you? Borrow it? No. No! Aw, too late, pretty-pretty. But don't worry, you'll get it back when I'm done with it. M-my face. My face. She's sexy, she's strange, she's seductive. Ladies and gentlemen, this is, Mystery Girl. We got another one just like the others. It's pretty gruesome. Brief me. Young woman, her face cut off. No apparent motive, no witnesses, no leads. - No evidence. - Okay, okay. I get the point. So, how many have we got now? This makes 13. All the same. I think it's pretty safe to assume that these were all done by the same killer. Ya think? We need answers, like, now. Wait until the press gets a hold of this. Oh, that's the last thing we need now. Make sure no important information is leaked, okay? - You got it? - Yes, sir. I'm right on it. That skin mask that I wear... It fits so right. It makes me feel like I'm alive. Like I'm not the disfigured freak that I am. Ah, my little pretties. You all look so lonely hanging there. Waiting for me to come home, I see. Did you miss Mommy? Well, there's gonna be an addition to our little family, whether you all like it or not. Now, you be nice to her. There's more than enough room for another. You'll get used to it, my little darlings. This is gonna be a big... family. Well, looky here. - Hey, Sarge. - What you got? Looks like a business card from a titty club or a stripper. Check it out. Huh. LAPD, I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Um, okay. We haven't done nothing, though. What about one of your dancers? Pretty sure she's a feature here. Goes by the name of Mystery Girl. We got a lot of girls here, mister. I don't know all of them. The name is Sergeant Anders, fuckface. Now, you're gonna tell me whether she's here or not. You got it? Mystery Girl. Hey, over here. There's a cop out front looking for you. He'll be down here any second. Stall him, cherie, I'll make it very worth your while. You got it, girl. I'll run interference. Now get. Hurry! Go! Where do you think you're going? No people allowed. There's naked girls back there. Very funny. There are naked girls out here, too. It's a strip club. Now, get out of the way or I'm taking you downtown, too. Smart girl. Ready or not, Mystery Girl... Here I come. Hey, you jerk. You can't be back here. Get out! Yeah, you asshole, get the fuck out or we're gonna call a cop. I am a cop. Mystery Girl just came through here. Where is she? What's it to you? Yeah, we're not telling you dick. All you cops are the same. All bark, when all you really want is some free sex. Wrong, I just want Mystery Girl. And you girls better start talking if you know what's good for you. Why, what are you gonna do, shoot us? Oh, believe me, right about now, I'd really like to. But, no, I'm not gonna shoot you. But if you don't start cooperating, I can make your life very complicated, if you understand me. Thanks, doll-face. At least one of you girls has got some brains. I know you're in here, Mystery Girl. Come on out, make this easier on both of us. Okay. Guess we're going to have to do this the hard way. We know you're the face-ripper. We know you killed all those women. We know you took their faces. Do you really think I'm dumb enough to fall for that crap? And now I'll have your face too, you stupid jerk. I will never give up. You cut my fucking face, you sick goddamn cunt! Go ahead, run, Mystery Girl. How far do you think you're going to get with a couple of rounds in you? I'm gonna get you. No matter where you go, no matter where you hide, I'm gonna get you, you sick fuck! You hear? I'm gonna get you! All right now, coming to the main stage, it's our new feature attraction. Put your hands together for strange, alluring, Mysteria! That Mystery Girl is a sly little bitch. Look at the mess she made. There. Good as new. Well, almost. And now, my darklings, our next story. Contessa. You can get up. Is this your daughter? Yes, Contessa, yes. Come here, child. She is good girl. Untouched. I assure you. So she's a virgin? Yes, Contessa, she's pure. Yes. And so she better be. Thank you, thank you, Contessa. Thank you, thank you. Mama! It is fine. Go with them. They take you to Contessa Castle. It will be your new home. Mama! Another girl for you to groom, Sheska. I leave her in your capable hands. Of course. As you wish, my Contessa. Have you ever been in a castle before? Another peasant girl. Very well. My name is Sheska. You will obey me at all times. You understand? Yes? Take her and get her cleaned up and put her among the other girls. Bow to your Contessa when she enters the room. This one, Sheska. This one? Yes. Are you sure, Contessa? She's perfect. Sheska? Come to me, Sheska. Has all been prepared? Yes, my Contessa, all is as you wish. Very well, then. It is time. Kneel to your Contessa. Come closer, my dear. Get rid of her. Now. Yes, Sheska. Bring me my cloak. In my skin there is tingle, Sheska. Yes, Your Highness. Do I not look beautiful and more youthful? Yes, of course. You look much younger and even more beautiful than before. It's just the blood, the blood of the virgins. Dispose of the body in usual manner. And be discreet. As the villagers are beginning to whisper things. And we best not give them any more to whisper about. As you wish, my Contessa. Help me. Help me. Please. Please. Please, help. Help me. Please. So young. And you're so beautiful. Please. Please. And your skin, it is like silk. Please. Please, help. - Please, please, please. - Please. Please, no, please. Please, please, please. Please! Please, no. Please, please. You smell it too, don't you, my dear? Virgins taste sweet, do they not? We are alike, you and I. We like what we like, and whether or not they understand, it does not matter. Now, my black beast, bring me a girl. Bring her to me. Rip out her throat... and let me suckle... her sweet... juice. Your youth is a precious gift, my little doll. It will keep me young. Sheska, come take her away. Yes, my Contessa. Mmm. Stupid bitch. She's going this way. No. No. Please, don't! No, please, don't take me back. Don't! Please, don't take me back. Please, mercy. With this axe, I hereby seal your fate and send you to the other realm. No, please, no. Well, this world no longer holds a place for you. Please, mercy. I will drink your blood and feed your headless body to the flames. Proceed. And so, my pretty... Nothing to say? This is coming with me. And that, that you can send to the pile with the others. Well, my darklings, after that one, I need to take five. And what could be more relaxing than a nice, long... bath? So, until next we meet, stay dark.
