My grandfather believed all chocolate was a form of magic... an alchemy, where the beans of a cocoa tree are transformed into the elixir that is chocolate. My Opa and Bommi came to America from Belgium, settling in Watson Corners. Opa felt every town needed a good chocolatier, so he passed down his magical chocolate recipes to me, Lucy Sweet. Yes, that's my real name... Well, after my grandmother changed it from "Van Suyt". Bommi wasn't much of a confectioner, but she knew how to give the customer a good story. We call these the "Cupids". They're very special, and they're going to be part of our story... Mine and my mother's... which has been, for many years now, entirely predictable... Both our lives wrapped up like pieces of chocolate. Mom out on the sales floor with customers, and me, able to hide out in my happy place... day after day, making these chocolate elixirs, exactly as Opa taught me... until today... when everything changed. 62% rent increase. Each and every month. That should be illegal! I know. I knew this was gonna happen when Ben retired and Bruno took over. You know, I even gave that boy a box of your best dark-chocolate toffees. Well, maybe he prefers milk chocolate. No one over 30 prefers milk chocolate. I don't want to lose this place. Hey. Then we will find a way. Serena? Ha-ha! Engaged! Oh, my gosh! Congratulations! Oh! Thanks to you two! Oh, I think Tyler would say differently. No! He agrees. It's the Cupids. They worked their magic, thanks to you two Sweets. Aww. Cupids? You don't know? Uh, it's Georgie's second day. It's the first thing she should've learned! Anyone who eats one of the famous... - Not famous! - Sweet family chocolate Cupids is guaranteed... Not guaranteed! To find their true love. As long as their heart is open to it. Mom! What? It's part of the legend! We even have a "Wall of Love". Oh, I wondered about that! A tribute to the many successful love stories over the years. And now mine, too! Tyler and I met right after we ate the Cupids, and rest is history. I'll take a dozen. Ah! Well, right this way. You need to advertise the Cupids. It just doesn't feel right. You know, Opa always said not to get greedy. They're supposed to find the people they're meant for. Well, you're gonna have to do something, because we have the same landlord, and I'm pretty sure you're getting the same rent increase that I am. I know. And you can sell flowers year-round. Our biggest season is Valentine's Day, four weeks away, and after that... Maybe you'll sell so much, you won't need it. I love your optimism, but I'll need a miracle. Or... a very good friend who actually works her social-media presence, unlike some. You're blowing up on social media! "Magic Chocolate Cupids"? Serena, what did you do? Magic chocolates? Harold Welby! Your card says you're a licensed and bonded plumber, but there's no record of you at... They always run. I'm surprised he didn't bolt as soon as he saw you coming. I know, right? And you with the camera! I mean... hey, good job keeping it steady through the alleyway. Harold Welby is still at large, but he has scammed more than 20 people with his "fake plumber" scheme to the tune of $56,000. This is Dean Chase, Channel 55 News, and I fight for you. Do you think I should I keep the pointing? It's kind of your thing. Yeah. Hey, Nora. Sure thing. I'll be right there. What's up? Fingers crossed it's about the Chicago gig. I put her down as my reference. Oh! Bold... Asking your current boss to help you get another job? I'm her favorite. So, you'd better be ready to saddle up as soon as I get back. I bet you she's got something juicy for us. "Magic chocolates"? Apparently, there's a chocolate shop in Watson Corners where people fall in love, if they eat a particular chocolate on Valentine's Day. Okay... so, do you want me to do a quick hit or a longer expose? "People Cheating the Lovelorn." Throw in some shady matchmakers, catfishing... Love potions? None of that. I want a very nice story for Valentine's Day. But I do exposes. I understand, but that's not what that is. Valentine's stories are popular. This is a gift. Trust me. Okay, what about the House vote on misuse of funds? The faster you get the story, the faster you can get back to watching politicians talk out of both sides of their mouth. How is this a gift? I'll tell you when you come back with the story. And Dean? Make it sweet. Pun intended. Uh-huh. We're almost out of Cupids! Okay. Hey, we're out of cocoa beans. I'm gonna run to the market. - Okay. - Demand's a good thing, right? Right. I'm still gonna kill Serena. Get the cocoa beans first! Yeah. And Lucy? Breathe! - Thank you. - Thanks. There you go. Next? Thank you. Have a good day. Thanks. Ah. Whew. Excuse me. I'm a reporter. Excuse me. Dean Chase! That's me. Was that one of those "magic love" chocolates? Mm-hmm! Did you come here specifically to buy one? Mm-hmm. I hate to break it to you, but you've been had. That was Dean Chase. Dean Chase! Ooh! - Oh! - Oh! You really need to pay attention to where you're going. Sorry... again. Uh... I, uh... I was just... distracted by the mass delusion. "Delusion"? Yeah. Basically, a... a testimonial about how this place's chocolate Cupids help you find true love... Or whatever that is... It went viral, and now there's a run on the place. You don't agree? I don't agree with deception. This is deception of the worst kind... Manipulating people's hopes about love. Now, magic chocolates? Come on! It's a total scam. And I do happen to be a bit of an expert on the subject. On chocolates? Scams. Dean Chase. Channel 55 News. - Great. - Yeah, my boss wants me to do a "nice" story on this place, but what I wouldn't give to do a takedown, you know? Uh, anyway... what's your name? Lucy! There you are. Been a madhouse since you left. Sorry, Mom. It was so busy, I couldn't find parking. Oh, sorry. Lucy Sweet. Chocolatier... and nefarious love-scammer. Thanks for stopping by, Mr. Chase. I, uh... I don't think we'll be going forward with any kind of story, though. Uh, you know... Bye, now. I can help whoever's next. Oh, my gosh, my favorite. Yum. Yeah. Ooh, yum. Delicious. Do you need a ribbon? You went to a small, family-owned artesian chocolate shop to do a simple feel-good Valentine's Day story and got kicked out? I mean, I wouldn't say "kicked out". Asked to leave! Mm, more implied. What is wrong with you? This was a warm hug of an assignment. It's a con, Nora! And lying to people about love? That's like waving a big red flag for me. Dean, you're one of the hardest-working reporters I've been around... Here or elsewhere. And I know you have your sights on being an anchor in a bigger market... but you're not getting the Chicago job. Can I ask why? They're not considering anyone without some anchor experience. But that's what I'm trying to get here! And that is where the chocolate-Cupid story comes in. And... that's where you lose me. Alex in the Morning is about to be down an Alex. He's moving to Dallas. We need a new anchor. Uh, are you... Does that mean that I'm... You're in the mix. Along with Patrick and Adam. Adam is in the lead, but mainly because his first name starts with an "A"... Less signage changeover. Well, tell me... Just tell me what I need to do. You've got the investigative journalist part down, but morning shows are about easing the viewers into their day, with lovely stories about...? Magic chocolates. Oh. Think of this as my Valentine's Day gift to you. I can do this! Nora, I can do this, I just... I just need another chance. Bring me something good so I can convince the rest of them that you're the guy. Okay! Nora... I will make this happen. Don't ever do that to me again. Yep. Yeah. And while Mr. Fernsby claims his zucchini is the largest in the world, some in the farming community have their doubts. This is Dean Chase, Channel 55 News, and I fight for you. Why do you look like that? We had the best day of business in months. Outside Christmas. Usually, the Valentine's Day rush doesn't start till February. Well, the momentum from Serena's post is only gonna last so long. Then let's call that news guy who wanted to do a story about us. He thinks we're scam artists. Then we'll call a different newsperson. Do a good story, and feature the Cupids. Mom... you know how I feel about that. Honey, it's a silly superstition. We've been selling them for years! Yeah, by word by mouth. Why tempt fate? Because we're running out of time. If you want to keep the shop, we have to make a change. We both know, once Valentine's Day is done, profits plunge. We either earn enough now to overcome the rent increase for the rest of the year, or... you know. All right. Thank you very much. All right, see you in a few days. Hi. What are you doing here? Um... how creeped out would you be if I told you I saw you leave your shop and I followed you here? On a scale of one to ten? About a... 17. Okay, that's fair. I come in peace. Better yet, I come in business. Yeah, I'm not interested in doing business with someone who thinks I'm running some kind of chocolate love con. Also fair. We obviously got off on the wrong foot. "We" didn't. You did. "Dean Chase of Channel 55." Huh! You're familiar with my work? Yeah. I wasn't. Until last night, when I watched some videos. Impressive. Really. Especially that fake giant-zucchini scandal. You really stuck it to that farmer. Okay, that was very early in my career, and the station was supposed to have taken that clip down by now. Yeah... it's still there. Great. Awesome. Uh... is this where you buy your magic beans? Sorry. Just hear me out. I've already heard enough. You're not gonna persuade me to place the reputation of my family's legacy into the hands of a clearly cynical man. And if you keep following me, I'm gonna upgrade that 17. Which you don't want. I am not following you. I just... I really need this story to happen. You should have thought about that before you led with insults. You're absolutely right. 100%. I messed up. Now, all I am asking is for five minutes... three minutes of your time, so I can give you my proposal. I know you don't owe me that. And I will take your "no". I will walk away and leave you alone, if that's what you want. I just think that this could be really good for your shop. Three minutes? - Three. - Start talking. Okay. Great. - Starting right now. - Sure. So, your Wall of Love. A lot of people have fallen in love after eating your chocolates, right? Why don't we interview and hear their wonderful Cupid stories? A morning anchor, huh? For now. Hopefully, it'll lead to a bigger market, bigger job. And a story about "How Sweet It Is" helps you... how? By softening my image. My producer thinks that if I do this story and it goes well, the board might take that into consideration over my lack of anchor experience. And what's in it for me? Exposure. Of the most positive kind. Glowing, even! You gotta know that the momentum from a viral post can only last so long. But a news story like this... This could take you to the next level. You could ride this wave till Valentine's Day and beyond. I don't trust you. I don't blame you. And I want final approval on the story before it airs. I don't even get final... I'll... I'll see what I can do! It will be a glowing review, right? "Glowing"? Oh... glowiest. Not a real word. It... It's a real promise, okay? From me to you. Just... Just give me a chance. That's all I'm asking. Okay. Here you go. Don't break it. I will treat it with love and compassion. I really wish you were coming with me on this one. Adam already called dibs. DeMatto trial. Oh, Gary, you're killing me! I would love to cover that story. Hey, buddy! You're spending the day in a chocolate shop. That wins. Hmm. So you sure it's okay to close the shop for the afternoon? Wouldn't want to deny anyone their true love. Right! Okay... Oh, no! No, no! I didn't mean it like that. I was just being, you know... Look! I am excited about this. Okay. Heh. So. The idea is, um, we'll do a couple questions. Easy ones. "How'd you become a chocolatier?" "Why the Cupids?" "What's the deal with the legend," or whatever. Okay. Don't take it off again, please. Look, don't disparage the legend, okay? I won't. The "glowiest". Remember? The glowiest. I promise. Ahem. I'm just gonna hit record, then we're just gonna have a conversation. Just look at me. Okay? Okay. And so, chocolate is... Well, I mean... So, who doesn't love chocolate? Right? Right. Um... you make it here in the store, right? Yes. From scratch. How'd you get the idea of selling the Cupids? I didn't. Oh. My mom... My mom did. Helen Sweet. Did she keep her name when she got married? No, "Sweet" was my dad's name, which is why my mom is more comfortable in front of the cash register than making the chocolates herself, but... Can we not... Um, can we not... Can we not include that part? Yeah. That's okay, yeah. Let's see... Hey, that's super-annoying. Okay. I think we're gonna take a break. Why? Because you are about as relaxed as someone waiting in a dentist's office for a root canal. Well, there is nothing relaxing about having a light shining in your face and talking about yourself on camera. Yeah. You know what? Let's forget about this. Forget about the questions. Forget about the camera. Is that the, uh, "Wall of Love" I've heard so much about? Yeah. Some of our success stories from the Cupids. That's great. Did your grandparents put that up? No, actually, I did. It's one of the things I'm most proud of. Really? And, uh... Why's that? Well, my grandfather didn't make the Cupids very often. He only gave them to friends and family, 'cause he didn't like to draw attention to them. What changed? After both my grandparents passed, I had just gotten out of culinary school, and I took over the shop, and I started to make all of my Opa's recipes... except for one, because... well, I couldn't find it. But then, one day, I was in the back office, and I was going through some books, and the recipe just, sort of... fell out. Do you think he'd been hiding it? Maybe. It certainly felt like... I found it at just the right time. Like... Like I had to prove myself worthy of it. Anyway, I, um... I made a batch and my mom suggested that we sell it for Valentine's Day. And... we did. And, after a while, we heard back from, you know, people who had bought them... Customers who had tried them... And just had the most... well, the most amazing experience! Magical? Call it whatever you want. We're not making any guarantees. They were open to love and they found it. Seems pretty magical to me. Ahem. So... that wasn't so bad. Well, you used a lot of tricks to get me to be more authentic. It's all part of my job. You did great. I will let you know when we're gonna air it. Great. And, um... good luck with the anchor position. Thank you. I'm gonna... bye. And we started to hear back from all these customers who had bought them and then had these amazing experiences right after trying them. That... is exactly what I wanted! And now I want more. More? More chocolates. More... the shop. More Lucy Sweet! She's pretty aptly named. I kind of think I covered everything. And you're missing the best part! It's right in front of you. Uh... well, yeah... I mean, sure, she's charming, but whatever. Bit of a tough nut to crack. You mean the Wall of Love? You mean the Wall of Love. Exactly. The stories of those couples could be gold. Make it a multi-part series all the way to February 14th. Multi-part. That's, uh... That's a lot of Valentine's Day. Should I assign it to someone else? No, no, I'll do it! It's my story. Mm-hmm. Yep! Thanks for coming. Do you have any questions? So many. But, um... not about the condo. Thank you. It's not for you, is it? To be honest, it's been so long since I've even thought of living somewhere new, I'm... I'm still trying to figure out what is me. Mm. Well, here. Feel free to reach out if you want to see some properties, and maybe find the answer. Thanks. Hi. Didn't we, um, say goodbye two days ago? We did. Very final. Very sad. Yet here you are. My news director, Nora, loved the piece on your shop. Good. I mean, she's right... It turned out great. As promised. You did indeed deliver, yes. So... what are you doing here? Did you, uh, want to buy a chocolate Cupid? No. I mean, no offense. And this is me being so glad that our story together is over. Ooh, awkward. Why? Because I have another business proposal for you. And this one'll last a lot longer than the first one. If you were serious last night about talking to these people, you're not doing it alone. You don't have to come with me to every testimonial. Yes, I do. You're interviewing the Sweet family's Cupid success stories. I... gotta protect them. Protect them from what? From you. And your jaded views on love. I did all right... I did better than all right with your segment. One night versus four-plus weeks on this project? I don't trust you that long. You know, leopard's spots, scorpion on a turtle's back... All that. I'm not gonna poke holes in the legend, okay? You just air-quoted "the legend". All right. So... which couple should we interview first? Claire and Malcolm. They have a great story. Mom says that because she's the one that introduced Claire to the Cupids. Well, what can I say? I'm proud of my handiwork. Helen Sweet. - Dean Chase. - Dean Chase. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Is... Is that you? It is! So, you've eaten a chocolate Cupid? I did. A long time ago. Would you like to do a testimonial? No. Well, we should keep the stories outside the family, so that they're more believable. You know, for the cynical types. Ahem. Claire and Malcolm are really nice. Why does that sound like a warning? Because I'm just reminding you to be nice, too. I am nice. I am. As long as you're not a con artist or a scammer. Malcolm! Hi, Malcolm. Lucy! - Oh! - Oh, so good to see you. Good to see you, too. Dean Chase, right? That's right. Good to meet you. Listen, Claire is really excited to do this, and her classroom's right over here. But, just one thing... her teaching assistant is gone for the afternoon, so she was wondering if you two wouldn't mind helping her with a project first? I love projects. Sounds great. Perfect! I really appreciate this! Oh, of course! It's so fun. Isn't it? It is! It's fun. Uh, I am kind of worried that my hand is gonna be stuck like this forever. Rah! Rah! Rahhhh! Are you both teachers? No. Jalen, Miss Lucy and Mr. Dean are here to interview me and Mr. Malcolm about how we met each other. You mean about the magic Cupid chocolate? You know about that? Well, it's one of my favorite stories. And Miss Lucy here is the one who makes those very chocolates. Can I have one? You're gonna have to wait until you're a little bit older. How old were you when you had one? I, um... tch... I've actually, uh, never had one. What? You heard me. Never? Don't you believe in the magic? Ooh! Looks like Jalen here's coming for my job. Excellent question. Don't you believe in the magic? I do. Very much. Because I've seen what it can do firsthand. It was... love at first sight. Both times. Both times? We were high-school sweethearts. Uh... I thought you said you only started selling the Cupids to the public a couple of years ago? I did. Can we just... let them tell their story? Like Claire said, we were high-school sweethearts. My family moved into town my junior year. I remember seeing her the first day of classes, by the lockers, and thinking... "There's the girl I want to marry." And we did! 40 years later. We went to different colleges and lost touch. I wound up marrying Reggie. And I married Marie. And we went about our lives. I lived in Washington until Marie passed. And then, I moved back here to be closer to my kids. My Reggie was ten years gone by then... and that Valentine's Day, I had a feeling I was ready to try my hand at love again. Which is when Helen Sweet told me about the chocolate Cupids at Lucy's shop. My son had just called me in a panic, because he forgot to get a Valentine's Day gift for his wife. When I passed the Sweets' store, I remembered hearing from a friend of a friend about the chocolate Cupids, so I stopped in... on a whim. And there she was. It was fate. So you didn't actually eat a chocolate Cupid? I did, after I saw Claire was there. And you've been happily together ever since? Some things are meant to be. I just don't think you should claim them for the Cupids. Why not? Because they were already in love back in high school. Just because they already had a history doesn't mean they would've automatically fallen back in love when they met again. Tons of people see their exes. Nothing ever comes of it. They could've run into each other at a dentist's office and fallen back in love. What is with you and dentists? My point being... I think their love story is a bit more coincidence than chocolate. That's 'cause you're a cynic. Says the woman who won't even eat her own "magic love" chocolates. It doesn't make me cynical. What does it make you? I'm gonna walk home. Come on. It's five miles! In those shoes? Right. I'm not gonna walk home, but we're done talking about it. That's fine with me. - These are all orders? - Mm-hmm. Both from in the store and online. Georgie updated the site to allow for shipping. And she included a page about the history of the Cupids. Oh. Um, is that necessary? I can take it out. I... I thought you were on board with promoting them now? Isn't that w-what you're doing with Dean? No. I mean, yes, but... Of course, you can leave them in. It's just habit. I'll go. Hello? So... how are things going with Dean? Well, he basically doesn't believe that Claire and Malcolm should qualify as one of the "Cupid Couples," because they already knew each other. I was there! I... I can confirm it, if he'd like. That won't be necessary. I just... I just wish... What? I don't know. I just wish that he'd... would believe. Which is silly, because why do I even care? We always want to win over the non-believers. It's human nature. Have you given him one? A Cupid? - Mm-hmm. - No. Or any chocolate? Honey, you're very talented. He should know that about you. Well, I learned from the best. Some things are meant to be. This came together nicely. - Yeah, they're a fun couple. - Good work. What's next? Lucy and I will do some more interviews. I'm heading over there later to choose our next subjects. - Excellent! - Great. You should know, I got a call today from NYNS in New York about you. Really? I sent them my resume a year ago. Well, it made its way into the right hands eventually. Naturally, I gave you a rave review. Thank you, Nora. Though I would prefer you stayed here. But I was in your shoes once, so I understand. Did they mention what the position is? Correspondent... A mixture of stories, not unlike what you're doing now. But on the national scale. Keep me apprised. Yeah, will do. One other thing. Are you coming to the Valentine's Day event the station is hosting on Saturday? Uh, I wasn't planning on it. Reconsider that. Some of the top brass will be there. Think of it as part of your audition. Unless you're too distracted by the glamour of the Big Apple. I'll definitely be there. Good. And Dean? Hmm? Bring a date. Hi. Hey. So, how's business? Starting to settle back down. Well, I'm sure it'll pick up again after we air the Claire and Malcolm piece on Monday. Nora loved it. Well... that's what matters. Um... I'm sorry... about the other day. I don't mean to be so cynical. I'm sorry, too. - Truce? - Truce. Uh, so... who's up next? First things first, do you have any... dietary restrictions? Um, nope. I mean... other than zucchini. Do you prefer... dark, white, or milk chocolate? Oh, dark. For sure. I mean, no one over 20 should prefer milk, right? No wonder my mom loves you. "Ambrosia creme." This feels like a test. It's not a test. It just suddenly occurred to me that you've never tried any of the Sweet shop chocolates. Hmm. Well... a terrible oversight. Oh... this is... this is insanely good. Oh, my gosh! No wonder people think that chocolates are magic. Mm! Great. Let's go meet Pablo and Mark. I think I need to do some more research here before we move on. One day into February, and they're already busting out the Valentine's decorations. It'll look good on camera. Look at you... gettin' all expert with camera staging. They're over there. Hey, guys! - Hey, Lucy! - Hey! Hi. Pablo and Mark Martinez-Spencer, this is Dean Chase. Hi. - Hi! - Nice to meet you. Hi. Thanks so much for doing this. You're welcome. Nice meeting you. Okay. Oh, wow. Um, hope this place isn't too over the top. It's where I proposed, so we thought it would be nice for our story. It's perfect. We took the liberty of ordering some drinks. We have "Chocolate Kiss", "Love Potion No. 9..." - Mm. - And "Soulmate Sangria". "Soulmate Sangria" for me, please. I will do the same. Lucy's chocolate has ruined me for anyone else. Oh, same! Oh, go on. No, seriously, go on. To telling our love story. - Cheers. - Cheers. When I heard from a cousin about the super-cute Cupids that helped people find their love, I went right over there. Bought a dozen! My idea had been to eat one later, before I went on this date I had planned. Felix, not me. And I was so curious, and they smelled so good, that I had a bite right there in the store. Which is where I came in. And the next thing I know, we were the ones at the Valentine's Dinner. And it was officially the worst date of our lives. I mean, Pablo would not stop talking. I was nervous! And I was sure that I'd made a huge mistake. We were so different. But... then I realized, I was the one who'd eaten the chocolate. So he tells me the legend, and I thought, "Why not?" Right? I mean, the date could not have gotten any worse. We already emphasized that, honey. - Right. So I eat... - Honey. The chocolate Cupid, and... it was the funniest thing. I mean, part of me thought, "This is silly." But another part wondered, "What if?" Like, what if the person that you think is totally wrong for you because you're so different is actually the one? Because they're so different. All that from a chocolate Cupid? I'll tell you this... after I ate it, I couldn't get this one out of my mind. That's when I knew. We both knew it. Okay, tell me that story doesn't qualify. It qualifies. Yes! Victory is mine! So... Lucy? Wyatt? I thought that was you! Hi. Wow, hi. What are you doing here? I thought you were in Miami. Ah, well, one of my clients is in town on tour, so I thought I'd tag along, see the family, too. How fun for you. Wyatt Greggs. Dean Chase. Dean is a reporter for Channel 55. Ah... We're doing a story on Lucy's chocolate Cupids. Oh! Are you still making those things? They're actually incredibly popular. So, then I guess you're still working 24/7? And it's pointless to see if you'd want to grab dinner... Before I head back to South Beach? Yeah, sorry. I'm super-busy. Always were. Ah, well. Good luck. - Hmm? - With the story. See? Not everyone falls back in love with their ex. You two were in love? Maybe the feeling was closer to "strong like". But not strong enough to try a chocolate? There's a coffee cart down by the riverwalk, has a hot chocolate that is almost as good as mine. Let's go. I'll tell you why I've never tried a chocolate Cupid. Uh... yeah, okay. Well? It's really good. But I will have to try yours the next time I come over, just to compare. It's similar, 'cause we get our beans from the same vendor. Although, they use single-source and I blend two... Ecuador and Argentina. The farms that I like have strong fair-wage practices. It's a big thing in the world of chocolates. Yeah, I read up on that before I visited your shop the first time. Of course, you did. Mm! It's one of my favorite places around town. Yeah, me too. I live pretty close to here. How long have you lived here? Mm. It was, um, three years this past November. Might be why I'm getting itchy feet. But, uh, I seem to recall we didn't come here to talk about me. There's the small matter of some uneaten Cupids? I believe in the magic of the Cupids. I think it can bring you true love. And... that is what scares me. Why? Because of what happens when that love is taken away. And the... destruction that it can leave behind. Does that have anything to do with why you didn't want your mother giving a testimonial about the Cupids? Yeah. My dad got sick eight years ago... and he was gone really fast. My mom had a really hard time accepting it. They were so in love. And she was so lost for such a long time after. What do you mean, "lost"? She was just a, um... a shell. For years. It felt like I had lost both parents, even though one was still there. I even moved back home into my childhood house to help her. It's taken her all this time to get back to herself. A love like that, I... It scares me. So... does that mean you plan on never falling in love? I don't have it all thought out. But... you asked me why I've never eaten a chocolate Cupid, and... that's why. - I am so excited! - She really is. I really believe you. Can you just hold still for a second? I feel like this is all happening because of us! I mean, of course, we happened because of the Sweet shop's magic! Yeah, we're not on camera yet, so just save it for that. Here, come here. I'd always wanted to get married. My friends used to tease me all the time, 'cause I had a subscription to bridal magazines before I had a boyfriend. It's true. My problem was always finding the right guy, and believe me, I worked at it. But I always fell short. And of course, I knew about the Cupids. Lucy Sweet is my best friend. I resisted going that route for a long time. Maybe I wasn't sure if it was real, or... maybe I wanted to find love my own way. But, after a while... I had to accept that "my way" wasn't working. Then she tried the Cupids. Right there, in How Sweet It Is. And right as I turn around, this gorgeous guy walks through the door... Hang on... you fell in love with another guy before Tyler? No, I saw another guy before Tyler... and I was hoping I'd feel a rush of love, or something. Their date was terrible. No chemistry! You gotta have chemistry. So, how did you meet, then? Hey! You dropped your... earring. I'd never believed in love at first sight until I looked at my Tyler. What about you, Tyler? What's your story? I had eaten a Cupid earlier that day with the girl I was dating. - It was her idea. - Mm. But it didn't work out between you two? Total bust. She was nice, but... she wasn't Serena. What about your respective dates? Did either of them have a fairy-tale ending? I have no idea, I never talked to that guy again. Jessica's seeing someone. - Jessica? - My date. How do you know this? She told me. You still see her? Yeah, we're still friends, but I mean, it... I mean, we're just texting, mostly... It's that sort of thing. You... You're texting her? Sometimes. Tyler, when did you know that Serena was "the one"? When she kissed me. That's so cute. - It's sweet. - It's sweet. It's really sweet. You... Here, I'll take your coat. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, Serena's the best. Yeah, that was a great interview. But, is it just me, or did it get weird there at the end? Oh, no, it got weird. But they're so in love, it's crazy. So what are you doing now? Gonna make a couple hundred more Cupids. You were right. Business went up, and then some, after your station aired that story on Claire and Malcolm. Glad to help. Thought you were headed home. Uh, I was. But could I film you making the Cupids? No. Can't have the secret ingredient getting out. Oh, you never said anything about a secret ingredient. What is it? It's, um... a secret. It's love, isn't it? Come on, say it's love. It's not love. What? That's disappointing. Aw, is the cynic disappointed in the lack of love in my family's magic chocolate recipe? I'm not a cynic. Oh, right. Right, right. You're a... a realist. Something like that, yeah. So, what... What are you doing now? I am about to temper the chocolate. And what does that do? I'm not gonna let you film me making the Cupids, but... you can help me make the chocolate, if you want. I thought you'd never ask. Whoa. Ooh. Go get an apron. Yeah. Okay. So, this is tempering? It is. It's a later step in the process of turning cocoa beans, or seeds... Either word works... Into a little bit of heaven. Here, you try it. Oh, okay. Uh... Okay, yep, spread it. A little more of an angle. Can you spread it right... Here, scrape it like that. - Bring it all back. - Yeah. - To the middle again? - Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Uh, and wh... What does spreading it around do? Cooling it down. Then we're gonna heat it back up again. And why do we need to do that? Do you want the romantic version or the science? Uh, science, please. Tempering transforms the molecules of cocoa butter into beta crystals, which, in turn, makes shiny, snappy chocolate. And the romantic version? Magic. - Don't be stingy. - You're so bossy. I am the boss. - I don't know why... - Here, you need to hold... Turn your thumb. Around them. You know what? Here, I'll do it. Okay. Okay, watch. I'm watching. Did you always want to be a... Um, journalist? I always wanted to be a TV anchor. Like Peter Jennings or Bernard Shaw. They were always so calm in a crisis. Did Young Dean pretend to read the news out loud to his parents? No. They split when I was nine. My sister was still a baby, so I kinda took on the parental role. Mom and Dad were too busy marrying and divorcing their way through our childhood to do it themselves. Now you're probably thinking, "Oh, that's why he's the love cynic." No. I'm actually thinking, "That's why he's the protector of the little guy." That was fun. It was. So, I guess this is goodbye again? You know, actually, um... I've been thinking about another angle on the whole Valentine's and love. Something I'll put up on the station's website. Maybe you could help me with it? Depends. What's the idea? Well... Why are we still in love? Uh, because we work at it. We do. - Love is work. - Love is work. But it's also fun. - After the work. - After the work. I'm gonna remember that. It's just... I don't know. I just saw him at the park, with Jojo here... and I just thought, "That's my guy." Yeah? Totally. Love takes off the mask. And lets us see the real you. And the real other person. Yeah? Totally. I didn't want to live without love, and when I first took her hand, all those years ago, I knew I wouldn't ever have to. But you're leaving out one important thing. What's that? You're also a great dancer. That's what decided it for me. I remember. And, in those days, two ladies dancing together caused quite a stir. Not that we cared. No, we didn't. And that's love. We fell in love fast. And we broke up just as fast. We were young. Yeah. We stayed friends. Believe it or not. Then we started dating a bunch of other people for... The next decade. Until, one night, the both of us were talking about our latest dating disasters. And I started crying. So I hugged her. And the longer I stayed with him holding me, the more I realized, I... I didn't want to be anywhere else. Now we have four kids. - What do you think? - I love it. It's hard to believe that Mr. Cynical came up with this idea, though. Well, if you marinate in all things Valentine's for three weeks, some of it's bound to rub off. Well, if you like it, I will kick it upstairs and see what Nora thinks. All right. Hey, um... how's it going with the, um... the morning anchor job? I'm still in the running. Yeah, there's actually this thing on Saturday night. Thing? Um, the station's holding a promotional event for Valentine's Day. A lot of the folks who are gonna decide who the next anchor is will be there. Oh. So, no pressure. No, none. Just the fate of my career and thus my entire future life. Sounds super fun. Yeah. Do you wanna come with me? Me? Yeah, you. Um, Nora said I should bring somebody, and I bet she'd get a kick out of you being there. She loves the stuff we're working on. Um... But, if... If you don't want to, it's... I would love to. You would? Yeah. Okay. Great. - Cool. Um... - Okay. I'll, uh, text you the details? Uh, yeah. Of course. - Okay. - Okay. - Good work. - Thanks, you too. It's not listed yet. The owners are making repairs. But I thought I would show you, just in case you liked it. It's beautiful. - And these views. - Mm-hmm. I've always wanted a room with a view of water. Are you interested enough to put in an offer? I'm not sure. I haven't even told my daughter I'm thinking about this, let alone looking. She has so much on her plate already, I just... You still have a couple weeks before it hits the market, and maybe by then, you'll have told her. Oh, you look beautiful. Why am I so nervous? You haven't gone anywhere dressy in a while. It's natural. You should wear these. Dad gave those to you. Mm-hmm. And someone should wear them. They're too beautiful to stay hidden away. Are you sure? I'm absolutely sure. - Oh... - Oh... I'll get it. I'll get it. Okay. Hi, Helen. - Hello, Dean. - Nice to see you. Uh, is Lucy he... Hi. Hey, Dean. Nice suit. You... You look... Wow. - Thank you, Mom. - You're welcome, honey. Okay. Oh. Knock 'em dead tonight. Thanks, Mom. - Here, let me. - Oh. Thank you. Hey. You all right? Oh, yeah. There's just not a lot of fancy events for independent chocolatiers. Thank you for doing this. Of course. You and the station are a big reason that our sales are up, you know. I don't know if I told you this, but we had a huge rent increase a couple weeks ago. No. No, you just implied you needed sales to get better. That's why. Just trying to get enough momentum to get us through the year. And? How's it going? We're much closer to our goal than I thought we'd be. That's great, Lucy. And here is the woman who made it all possible. Oh, I love an intro like that. Lucy, this is my news director, Nora. Nora, Lucy Sweet. Ah, we meet at last. Nice to meet you. I was just telling Dean that our business is doing so well, I can barely keep up. All thanks to your news coverage. And that's my segue to run something by you two. I looked at some of your unused footage, and it gave me an idea. For? The perfect conclusion to the series. Dean does a live feed on the 5 o'clock news from How Sweet It Is on Valentine's Day. I love that! That would be so good for the shop. And good exposure for you. Exactly. We're already getting feedback from viewers on this more personable side to you. What better way to wrap it up than you eating a chocolate Cupid live on TV? Sorry, what? Well, don't worry, you don't have to pretend to fall in love. Uh, I... I mean, I think that would be Lucy's call. Eating a chocolate is Dean's decision. But, um, otherwise, I would be thrilled to have the live feed from the store. Perfect! We'll work out all the details on Monday. And now, I have to go play nice to the CEO. - It's lovely to meet you, Lucy. - Nice to meet you. I can make a secretly fake chocolate. No one will know. I'm not afraid of chocolate. Right. Of course. Because you'd have to believe in it for it to actually work. Oh, is that the secret ingredient? Is it belief? No. It's... paprika. Really? I'm gonna figure it out. I am an investigative journalist. Mm-hmm. Hey, hey, hey! - Oh-ho-ho, hey. - Hey. I hardly recognize you. Ah, I try to break out this jacket once a year to remind me that I'm civilized. Lucy, this is Gary Shane, my colleague, my favorite cameraman. The famous Lucy Sweet. I've been helping Dean edit the stories. And I plan to stop by your store for some chocolates. Oh, a Cupid? Ha-ha, too old for that. I love this song. And Dean would love to ask you to dance. Do you want to? Only if you want to. I do. Want to. Dance. ♪ ...In my arms Let me hold me... ♪ ♪ Gary, would you? Of course. ♪ ...Never let you again ♪ ♪ Like I did... ♪ Is this okay? Yeah. I don't get a lot of opportunities to dance in the shop. Oh, I don't know. Pretty sweet sound system back there. I bet you dance in the kitchen. Busted. ♪ ...I never fall ♪ ♪ Unless it's you I'm falling to ♪ ♪ I was lost in the dark... ♪ Did you talk to enough execs to help you get the job? I don't know. I'm glad I came. We should go home. Uh... Yeah, I guess we should, huh? Hi, Mom. Morning, honey. What's that? Why are you looking at houses? Oh, um... Honey, I... I think it might be time. For what? To sell the house. Oh. Believe me, this... This old place holds so many memories. Most happy. Very happy. But... It's because of all the talk about the Cupids, isn't it? It's got you thinking about Dad. Oh, no, no, no. I... I've been considering it for a while now. And you were so generous to move in here with me, but I just... I'm better now. I know you are. I know you don't like change. Which is why I didn't want to bring this up until after Valentine's Day. So, let's just set this aside, and we can talk about it later. You know, there... We're a day from Valentine's, and there's much work ahead, so let's just... - Mom. - What? You know I'll support you. That's good. 'Cause you might have to. I need some coffee. Yeah. Yeah. A little too much, too soon. Dean Chase. Hey. Where's Serena? Thanks. Oh, there you are. Where have you been? What happened? Jessica. Who's Jessica? Tyler's date. I'm sorry, since when? Two years ago. Tyler's been dating someone the whole time you've been dating? How should I know? Is that what he told you? No! We found out because of the interview we did with you and Dean. Are you talking about the woman that Tyler ate the Cupid with? They'll always have that bond! You ate a Cupid with what's-his-name and you don't have a bond. Yeah, but Tyler's still in contact with her. That crosses the line! Serena, he's crazy about you. Is he? Or have I been completely blinded by this whole Cupid-chocolate- love-destiny idea and completely missed the truth? Serena... I can't talk about it anymore. That's why I've been avoiding your calls. I've been hiding back here for the past week. Like you do in your kitchen. Oh! You have no idea how happy I am to see you. I desperately need a... a friendly face. What's wrong? New York? That's always been my number-one destination. I think it makes sense for what you want. It's not an anchor position. But it could lead to one. What about the anchor position at Channel 55? Nora says it's between me and Adam. Thanks to you. She specifically referenced the clips that I sent of our first story together. Well, look at us. It's all working out. You're getting a shot at your dream job, and it looks like I'm gonna be good for the year... Maybe beyond. Win-win. There's one other bump. The interview is in person, tomorrow. That's Valentine's Day. Yeah, I guess they just consider it Monday. What about the live feed? Well, the interview's at 1:00 P.M. I'm pretty sure that I can still do it, get back to the airport, fly home, and make it in time for the feed at 5... With the time-zone difference. That's cutting it awfully close. I know. I know. I really don't want to miss out... No. On our final story together. You're doing the right thing. Then why do I feel like I'm messing up? Because you're Dean Chase, and despite all appearances to the contrary, you have a good heart. Am I... Am I wrong to think that... we might be starting something here? We can't go there now. But if there is... If there's something there... Dean, you're going after what you want. Like you should. I don't know what I want. Yeah, but that's why you're going... to find out. And if you don't make it back in time for the live feed... I will. Right, but if you don't... it's okay. Hey, at least this way, you won't have to eat a chocolate live on air. Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. I just need to get through. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Just coming through. Just one? Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Mom, what's going on? Channel 55's ads for the live feed started running. Well, where's Georgie? Her grandfather's car wouldn't start. She had to go take him to his doctor's appointment. When is she coming back? Hopefully tomorrow. Do the Cupids come in milk chocolate? Ah, no. - Are these gluten-free? - Yes. - Can we order them in bulk? - I... I don't... Lucy? Okay, stop! We're closing the shop immediately. Thank you, please leave. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Come back some other time. Thank you. I'm sorry, I know. Honey... It has to be a curse. Lucy... Mom, you remember what Opa always used to say? Your grandfather was superstitious. Serena's heartbroken. She and Tyler were perfect for each other. Look at them now. Serena and Tyler are their own people. Georgie's gone. She'll be back tomorrow. Maybe. Look at us. We literally have too much success. This has a "careful what you wish for" curse written all over it. So you're a curse expert now? Mom, I can't possibly make enough chocolates to fulfill all these orders and get them out. We have a note on the order form that says they could be late. And if they want to buy them here? I can't make enough chocolates. We're going live tomorrow. We're not gonna have enough product. People are gonna write nasty reviews. They are gonna complain, and then we are gonna be ruined. So, do you want to call Dean and cancel the live feed? I don't know. He's probably not even gonna be here tomorrow. Where will he be? New York. For an interview. Oh... I see. Maybe it's the Cupids that are cursed. Why would you say that? Because look what happened with you and Dad. Your father got sick. It happens to people every day. Chocolates had nothing to do with it. It scared me, Mom. What happened after. I wish I'd gotten stronger faster. No... He was the love of your life. Of course, you were devastated. I don't blame you. But I also... I don't ever want that. Oh... Lucy... you can't go through life avoiding things that might bring you pain... You'll miss out on what it has to offer. But then I won't be sad. Oh, honey. You're sad right now. No. You can't avoid the hard parts. You have to face them, no matter what happens. Trust me on this one. Aww, honey. Come in. Good morning. How are you feeling? I found Opa's recipe for the Cupids. Such a little thing, but it's caused so much trouble. Come on. Just come with me. Mom, what are we doing here? I already told you I can't... I know. Just go. Thank you. Keep going. Just a little further. Serena? When Helen called, I had to come. Well, you've helped so many people. They all wanted to return the favor. Oh. You know I'm dramatic. We had a fight. Which turned out to be a good thing. We cleared the air on a lot of issues. Now we're better than ever. But now, I gotta go back to work... For you. Mr. Chase, they're ready. Thank you. Even Claire and Malcolm's story? Everybody, yeah. Hi. Hi there. I was just telling your mom here that I just got word from the station. They had a technical malfunction and now the piece they had prepared featuring the testimonials is unusable. Is there anyone here now from your Wall of Love to do a quick recording? I can. Great! I met my late husband in college. We were both dating other people at the time, so we were only friends, but... He always made me laugh. And I... I loved the fact that his parents were chocolatiers, but Scott couldn't boil water. I guess that gene skipped a generation. Things finally changed between us about ten years after graduation. I... I was shopping for a Valentine's Day gift for some friends, and I wound up in How Sweet It Is. Helen? Scott! Hi. Don't tell me you're baking now? I was just telling my friend over there about my dad's chocolate Cupids. They weren't for sale to the public then, but friends and family would drop by and the Sweets would give them away. Right. I remember you telling me that story. About how each of your parents ate one and then fell in love in an instant. It's not a story, it's the truth. You don't believe me? I dare you to try. I couldn't resist. Now, I don't know if I fell in love with him at that moment, or if I'd been in love with him all along... I only know that was the luckiest day of my life. Just like losing him was the hardest. But if you were to give me a chance to go back to that moment, when he gave me that chocolate... knowing what I know now... I wouldn't hesitate for a moment. Love is worth the grief. Oh, honey. Hey. Thank you. Hi. Come on, I only have a little bit of time. Serena, I'm swamped. You'll thank me later. I really do thank you, because you're the one who got all of this started with your post. You helped me find the love of my life... We're nowhere near even. But this dress will help. Come on. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Excuse me. Coming through. Emergency. Make way. I gotta move. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Wow. You made it. I told you I would. One minute. Um... there's something you should know. You got the job. Yes. And no. Right before I went into the interview, Nora called to offer me the morning anchor position. And I... I felt so happy, I just knew it was the right choice for me. What about New York? Oh, it turns out it's too far away from what I really want. Get in position. Come here. Come on. Ten seconds. Thank you, Kim. Four weeks ago, I heard about the legend of the chocolate Cupids from the chocolate shop How Sweet It Is in Watson Corners, run by Lucy and Helen Sweet. After a post went viral, many people flocked here after hearing that these chocolates could lead you to true love... if your heart is open... Which... mine wasn't. But Lucy Sweet introduced me... and many viewers... to some of the couples from the Wall of Love, who met after eating a chocolate. And I have to admit, by the time we were done, even I was ready to believe in the magic. But not because of the chocolates. Because of the woman herself... and her own special magic... that has me completely under her spell. And because of that, I am excited to try a chocolate Cupid myself today. Lucy... do you have one? There are two of them. I thought maybe... I might try one, too, if that's okay. Only if they're both the real thing. No fakes. There's no fake Cupids. What about the secret ingredient? If it's not love, or belief, or paprika, what is it? Bravery. What's more scary than opening your heart to love? Putting it all on the line? Everyone who tries one of these is willing to do just that... To risk it all. That's bravery. And I want to be brave. Shall we? I thought you'd never ask. My grandfather believed all chocolate was a form of magic. But for magic to be its best, it must have purpose. And what greater purpose is there than to love and to be open to love in return?
