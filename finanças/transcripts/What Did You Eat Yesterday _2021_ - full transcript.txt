Tell me honestly listen to me, Kenji Um First, I will not die I'm not sick now That's it... that's great Also, thank you for worrying about me But don't talk about "death" casually It is not good to say that you will "die" and "die without regret" sorry, you're right if you are really sick It's really inappropriate to say that. No, it's me who should apologize Huh? Actually... don't want! Please stop talking! Please, if you want to break up, please wait until the way back At least... let me maintain this happiness through tonight! How much delusion does a trip to Kyoto with your lover inspire you?

"I'm sorry, but don't come again" My mom even understands my situation But when I saw my son with a man It's still a big blow, it seems that even the body is broken... I'm sorry, I asked you to come, and I told you not to come really sorry for you This trip is just to apologize to you My parents thing... really sorry please forgive me what the hell... Just tell me this sooner, Sloan. I thought it was something what... so that's what happened But... you don't care about me Lingtang's body is worrying If I don't go to make them more comfortable It really doesn't matter if you don't go Thank you what... Great... you are not sick It's not about breaking up Why would you think of breaking up You think that way, it's the shock to me Huh? What... Huh? What... So you don't want to break up with me Well... let's relax a bit before eating What? Do you want to wear a bathrobe? Bathrobe? Look at this, let's wear yukatas together No, eat first I'll wear it later... - I'll help you... No, I wear it myself You're welcome... - No... I'll help you dress... - Dangerous... Rare opportunity... Title: The Movie: Yesterday's Food I'm in charge of a murder case Huh? Didn't you get a burglary as a public defender? Yes, that was originally the case of homeless grandpa stealing snacks in the shopping street But he clashed with homeless people in a nearby park If it turns into a murder case... It is "Judgement Joint Judgment" Lawyer Jian, please help me! No...! 'Combined Judges' Cases Will Be Busy And if you have to eat out often, there will be extra expenses... What? It's ok... that's right At your same time lawyer Aren't there many lawyers who are good at criminal cases? There is no lawyer like you in my contemporaneous period! What? Indeed In "Judgment by Judges"... The image of the defense attorney is also very important. Prosecutors are cunning I heard they deliberately picked A tall-looking judicial trainee becomes a prosecutor So the lawsuit will be won again and again It's just a rumor please, lawyer If it were you, you would definitely grab the hearts of the citizens! People who eat the law should not say such things! I'm not going to touch the "judiciary together" case anyway Did you really tell the police that you lost your mind because of this? Seems to say so... but I didn't think about killing him at all I'm timid You didn't intend to kill him, did you? Right In short, all favorable evidence will be collected before the trial... Shi Lang, as a lawyer, does not pursue a sense of achievement at work really be yourself But he still ends up taking a bunch of weird cases That's what he's good at But Sloan is stingy. He's not stingy He is down to earth, unlike you Huh? What happened? She found out that I bought expensive things It was a gift for a young sister They will be very happy to receive it Not this time... I didn't cheat this time what's the matter, shopkeeper Has your cheating been found out? Not found! I mean it wasn't cheating this time. You said "this time", didn't you? That's what the owner of the shop is. The workplace atmosphere has become tense I work in such an incredible place Tianbu Yes you seem very happy do I have it? If you live together after marriage, many things will happen You won't understand if you're single But I'm also living with my girlfriend Ah... you said that last time You also declared that "I will not do any housework!" Because that's the condition I promised to live with her She's ugly and an old woman in her thirties I only dated her because she was interesting. Who are you calling the ugly old woman? Huh? Huh? Welcome -Welcome welcome Miko, why are you here? Ah, this is the girlfriend I just mentioned what...? I will cut my hair so suddenly I should say I have something to tell you you don't listen to me at home I'm listening you have not! Listen to you tonight Excuse me - please take a seat welcome Do you really want to cut your hair? Right I just said that opening a coffee shop is my dream That's why I save you said it several times But how can things go so smoothly, so stupid What? Don't underestimate the restaurant industry It's hard to just pay the rent. Many stores closed after half a year You are in your thirties Don't be full of unrealistic ideals I'm scared to hear What does it mean to be afraid... Attorney Jian, I'm sorry, please help to fix the case ah... no As a mother, I also feel that the child is unreliable No, lawyer Xiu is very enthusiastic and capable. Glad to hear you say that correct Although it can't be called a thank you gift, do you want an apple? This is the apple from the customer look! Wow, what a great apple! Of course I'd be happy to take it, if you can give it to me But lawyer Xiu lives nearby, so I can share it with him. I called my daughter-in-law Haruna but she said no She speaks very directly I think she doesn't want to see me don't want me to go to their house Huh? Because we are mother-in-law and daughter-in-law apple, apple you don't say anything but know everything Mmmm delicious...! That... almost... Is it almost there? Is there a problem? Actually, I've been a little concerned since before. Yes when you are talking to someone Can you be a little more observant? Aren't you very outspoken? That's right... -Isn't that right...? At least not in front of guests I think it's better to talk about the ideas one by one. But it's a bit too much for you to talk to your girlfriend like that during the day That's really too much Did you say Miko? Forget about the guests, it doesn't matter what Miko said. Because they live together But... Can't tell the truth to those closest to you Who are you going to tell the truth? Appeared, Quote Maker are you talking about me? Did you call me that? It seems to be getting cold "I don't want to see you" really hurts Okay, let's make something Xian Er likes to eat. Unpeel the apple, remove the core and cut into slices Four apples, about 150 grams of sugar Pour the sugar into the pot Cook over medium heat until caramelized no need to add water It takes a while to get the sugar to brown so hot... Caramel will splatter, be careful Then turn the apple with a wooden spatula Use the moisture of the apple itself to mix and cook turn down the fire Flip the apples from time to time and cook slowly After it's all cooked until soft... Good morning, Sloan Good morning, Kenji What is the taste? It's a caramel apple Are you going to put it on toast? Wow! I want I want! Give you wow looks delicious I'm going to start - I'm going to start good to eat what... Um? Feel so sick Huh? Put Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream... put it up like this Sprinkle with cinnamon So hot and icy, so happy... looks delicious Would you like to come too? ice cream left delicious Then I'll eat some it is good wait, I'll do it myself... enjoy your meal is not it? Really delicious! But the calories... Don't worry, it's morning It's from Mr. Konohana The refrigerator at Mr. Konohana's house is broken? Right He asked me if I could have fresh produce and vegetables Fortunately today is Saturday So Mr. Konata is coming over now? Right I see I'll ask him to bring Gilbert with me I have absolutely no doubts about your relationship with Mr. Kohinata now. Yeah? It is true... oh, I see I'm serious I'm sorry, Mr. Jian Holidays still come nothing May I? Excuse me Why even come with me? Today is the day when I eat mustard beef and potato chips while watching dramas sorry Kenji would mind if I was alone with Mr. Konohana I put this here - what? Mind what? What? Is there a relationship between Xiao Da and Mr. Jian? Is he out of his mind? For Xiaoda, what about Mr. Jian and me? Just an ordinary person who gets wrong just because he's cute The gap between the models at Paris Fashion Week Oh, he really loves to worry about it ok... I get it, we are different levels But last time I said I wanted to eat with you He also followed worriedly. Yes what are you doing there! Don't bite your ears secretly there! Yes You'll even pack the cream and freeze it? Yes, because dairy products can absorb the smell of the refrigerator If the ice is in the freezer, the taste will not change. I see Please wait a minute, Mr. Konohana Anyway, my civilian-level refrigerator Can't freeze so much Although the weather is getting colder Meat and fish should also not be kept at room temperature all the time Then cook them all and eat them I was planning to come this way from the beginning. That's right, if that's the case... Hello, although I don't know what's going on Anyway, I, Kayoko Tominaga, was called over. Sorry for being so sudden nope... Ah, Mr. Konata, long time no see! Hello Hello This is my first visit to Mr. Jian's house who is she? She is Mrs. Tonaga Kayoko's wife We often meet at the nearby supermarket, and we are partners in grocery shopping. Need to buy a lot of fruits and vegetables at once we will share right - yeah By the way, what about her and Mr. Ko Hinata... Mr. Hinata and my husband are tennis players Come to my house next time thank you for the invitation what... Shouldn't you be... Xianji? No Isn't this a high-grade shark-finned scorpionfish? And this Is it the beef cutlet for roast beef? Right purple onion Italian cilantro, I've never bought it Little tomato, this is not the usual kind this can be a fruit Wow, this mustard seed sauce is so stylish too I always feel like I'm being stared at in the fridge really shy Mr. Hinata... Are you a celebrity? What? Your ingredients are so luxurious Completely different from Mr. Jian who only buys specials Isn't it good for me? Anyway, what is cooking? Just enjoy what you think is delicious Then start with the simplest roast beef Mr. Jian, can you help me slice the garlic? It is good Mr. Hinata, please take out the pot it is good Pour 180ml of soy sauce into the pot 200ml of wine Measure another 200ml of water and pour it in Excuse me This way you don't waste any seasoning that sticks to the container No need to wash the container again it is true Then put the sliced ​​garlic in then fire When the sauce is boiling, put a whole piece of beef in it Cook for 1 minute 45 seconds Flip to the other side and cook for 1 minute 45 seconds Repeat this action Turn off the heat until all four sides of the side are cooked Then take a long chopstick and stab it To make sure it's cooked, right? Ah, it smells so good It's a little hard to poke but you can poke It means it's cooked just right If you can't touch it at all, it means Taisheng If you can poke it all at once, it means too familiar I see If you poke just right Put the meat in the big crisper Then bring the sauce in the pot to a boil again After the residual heat has dissipated, pour the cooking juice into it Finally put it in the freezer and it's done strangeness? Isn't it roasted? Yes, this dish is like the beef version of braised pork It's too simple As expected of Mrs. Kayoko right! But this dish is probably not easy for Mr. Jian... Um? Why? The secret to the deliciousness of this dish is to use high-grade meat Then I will do it at home It should have been put until the next day. But are you going to eat tonight? Then freeze it for 1 hour before putting it in the freezer. It is good Mr. Jian, do you have frozen clams? Huh? Clams again? Little Big, you know I hate clams But do you like clam gravy? Let's make Italian-style boiled fish The fish has been gutted, making preparations much easier Put the whole fish in the pot after smearing a lot of salt on both sides of the fish crushed garlic stalks of parsley Put about ten black peppers into the pot Ah... Mr. Konata Yes Pour in 150ml of white wine 120ml olive oil 300 ml of water then fire After the soup has boiled, add the frozen clams Cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes Add the tomatoes at the end Cook for another 5 minutes and it's done That should do it I should almost go back Please stay and dine, please come with Mr. Tominaga Actually, Michiru and Tatsuya are coming too today Ah, Michitome is my daughter She has been with her boyfriend for 9 years So today is your family reunion, I'm so sorry it does not matter Actually, Michiru is getting married.

I can't wait any longer, hurry up and eat Eating too late will make you fat I love you even when I get fat, right, Mr. right What's up with this roast beef, it's so tender Although it is very raw inside, it has a strong meat aroma. The red meat part is refreshing and sweet It must be very high-grade meat. We can't afford this kind of meat anyway. Not so exaggerated This is so much better than the roast beef you've made before The roast beef I made before was a pain in the ass This Italian-style boiled fish is also super delicious The big-winged scorpionfish sucked up the clam soup As expected of Mrs. Kayoko's recipe, it's perfect Finally, pour the rice into the Italian-style poached fish soup to finish Wow! Long live the stewed rice! Come on jibel, carbs Sloan the sadist so bad add olive oil is this okay? will get fat It's ok wow, this is delicious well fed I hate carbs It's all to blame Mr. Jian for serving that evil dish he just said it was delicious... - yeah By the way, do you want to come to our house this Christmas?

Since you said this in Kyoto I've always been interested Said he didn't want to see me... told me not to come again... really overkill you can be angry... I want to be pissed... But I don't have that position Because I'm not your daughter-in-law, nor your wife Most people just think that I... "unusual" Don't say "unusual" and I'm scared I am not angry... for fear of ruining our relationship I'm acting like a submissive Actually for myself rather than being considerate to you I don't think so Feel sorry... said strange things Anyway, don't worry about the New Year It's alright when you talk time to sleep sleep Lawyer Jian, let's go have a drink The work is over, why not have a drink?

I was the one who asked you to bring Mr. Yabuki back in the first place Having said that... This may not be an easy hurdle to overcome I just wanted to tell you that I'm not unhappy at all But it's just my wishful thinking If mom is so stressed that she ruins her body I won't insist on bringing Xian Er back But relatively... I won't come back here for Chinese New Year Feel sorry That is to say From this year onwards, we will be here for the New Year I want to cook red and white rice, black bean and rice cake soup Getting busy!

People like us are annoying just by being there Being beaten and kicked is commonplace Asking me to come forward will only make me more embarrassed People like your lawyers won't understand It's ridiculous! He didn't do it, but he got 9 years in prison The client said it would be embarrassing to appeal again I think what he said is true we must respect him People who eat the law should not say such things! Yes Can't make him feel like it's useless to come forward Otherwise our existence would be meaningless. That's right Let's hold on I cheated What? What? That... It's alright, I'll finish it right away But... I finally gave up on opening a coffee shop Of course, I told you from the beginning that it wouldn't go well. You just lie down and drink beer and talk But onishi he has my business in mind Seriously stop me from opening a shop He said that no matter how hard you try, you have to borrow money to get by, and asked me to stop He also said that he would go with me and ask others Then he really bowed his head to others for me In contrast, you have done nothing for me! So the conclusion of cheating It's me who decided to be with Daxi Right... It's surprising that you only say "yes" You are too much, you even cheat! But I really didn't do anything for you No way, just break up! Goodbye, Miko, take care What? What? Then... because the room still has my luggage I'll be in and out of the room for a while I see goodbye goodbye Sorry for causing such a commotion it's ok... walk slowly Sorry for disturbing everyone Welcome again Tianbu Yes I don't know why, but anyway... You're handsome What? I'm in awe of you strangeness? Nice is this handsome? -thanks what! Stress builds up if you don't buy things Kenji... It rained suddenly, thank you for the umbrella You're welcome that day... Yes Although you are very simple But won't you let it go? I'm not obsessed with others don't you like her? Is it so important to like it or not? I think I like each other too much tantamount to deprivation of liberty I hate that If Miko really decides to start a new life with Onishi It's okay to cheer for her. What... what the hell... are you gentle thank you Why are you suddenly speaking so earnestly? What's the situation? Why are those two feeling shy? By the way, Yabuki-san - Huh? Do you have any countermeasures for hair? Any maintenance after that? Yes, look, how is it... What are you doing now? No matter how you think about it, you know they are colleagues What am I panicking He's just a young man in the shop just work mates... Wait, is this jealousy? Am I jealous? Kenji good morning slang What's wrong? You are on vacation today, right? Where are you going? (Head SPA, half price coupon) I have something What's the matter? It's not important Your coffee is ready, sorry for not preparing breakfast Then I'm out and many more... Can I continue the lease as usual? It's alright... ok, let's keep renting No way... What am I thinking so stupid Work hard...! The hospital... is he not feeling well? Maybe it's not a new love anymore... such a simple question Kenji... I'm stuffed sorry slang I'll be back tomorrow at noon to finish these Just a little bit... I've been losing weight recently, and I'm a little fatter no, you're skinny Really? I'm so happy that I lost weight Kenji What do you want to lose weight for? What's the meaning? You like me more skinny too Also, I'm going out early tomorrow no breakfast I must have a good talk with Xian Er today Mr. Jian, I'm sorry Can you give me some time? No, today I... - please it's urgent Gilbert ran away from home? It's been three days...! It's been three days and I haven't come home yet When I'm alone, I can't stop thinking about it... It's alright, Mr. Konata Gilbert is also an adult in his thirties. He has money too Mr. Jian, you don't understand You don't know what stupid things Emirates will do when she can't think about it he is a dangerous child In fact, the reason why we meet... Ah Air! What stupid thing are you trying to do? Had a one night stand with another man... You have to cherish yourself even more! It's all because of you! Who told you to always not respond to my wishes If I can't date you, it's the same with everyone! Emirates... Ah Air! It's so dramatic What if he gets caught and ravaged by bad men... No, if it ignited his interest instead... It's weird just thinking about it Please calm down, Mr. Kohinata He's Gilbert He must be trying to make you anxious You have to show the air of a mature man occasionally How about pretending not to care and waiting for him to come back? How could I possibly do it! Important people may disappear in front of their eyes from now on How can there be a way to not care! You listen... People like us only because of a little thing You may lose the person you love forever! Feel sorry... I found ah He's at a coffee shop near my house coffee shop nearby? Emirates... You idiot! I told you before about this lovely new coffee shop around here why don't you come to me... Ah Hang, that's great! I heard that he went to stay at his favorite hotel at night It's a real shock I am back Xian Er, I'm sorry, I just came back, and dinner hasn't... that... What does this... look like? Did you cut your hair? Can't you? Is it weird? Nasty, what to do... Not that... good, very good Blonde hair suits you too Really? Sloan thank you! I'm actually worried about this hairstyle But you say it's good, it's good Throne? Kenji Um? You... Is there anything uncomfortable? Huh? Why do you ask? Because you cut your hair suddenly also went to the hospital... How did you know? Hate, it's not like that... You don't care about him! You've been acting weird lately Don't eat fats and oils, and you can't finish your favorite dishes Only half of the meal left Even if the house should be renewed or not... Kenji tell me honestly you... Won't die? I say... It's not what you think it's hair... My hair... my hair is thinning What? The young man in our shop said I had a bad head The guy speaks directly The one who was with you last time... What? Fine... together? Did you see us? What? So everyone advises me not to eat fatty foods Want me to go to a scalp clinic or something... Scalp clinic? Yes, I was there to consult... But in order to make myself not care I'll change my hair color first, cut my hair short... That is to say... Don't worry, I'm not feeling well Sorry... as for the lease renewal... The last time I went back to my hometown, my mother asked me if I wanted to inherit her shop... Huh? Of course I refused, but for a moment I couldn't help thinking about it If you're going back, you'll have to move What? Meaning is... Will you also move to Saitama's hometown with me? And this option! I should have promised to inherit the storefront! So the sisters can see Shi Lang I can show them "He's handsome...!" Throne? I'm scared... when I know you go to the hospital thought you might be sick ...may die I feel so scared! Don't just talk about "death" Sloan tuna... What?
