Hey, I must say, this is the best place we've hit so far. It's not exactly swinging, but it is dangling. Say, why don't we... why don't we stay here for a day or two? No. I think we should go as far as we can in the first week. Don't you? I mean, if we push off now and don't bother about lunch, we should be in San Nouverre by tonight. - Hey, do you think he's French? - Hmm? Yes, I suppose so. Oh, he's very dishy. Oh, he's definitely French. I mean...he's got that look. - What do you think? - Smile, please. He's shy too! Cathy...St Nouverre? - It's miles. - No. It's no further than we did yesterday. - What if we want to stop? - There's bound to be a few places not marked. Okay, if you say so. Well, come on. We're not going to see much of the country sitting here. Right. Are you ready then? Oh, I have to spend a penny. - Do you want to go? - No. Then I'll wait. I don't fancy that. Especially after yesterday. Well, I did warn you, didn't I? I thought you were joking. I mean...standing up! Very fancyable! Cathy! He heard you! - I wonder what they're doing now? - Hmm? - Back at the hospital. - Matron will be on her morning rounds. - Anne went to Spain. - Mm, I know. She and a girlfriend, and that boyfriend of hers. You know, the one with the big nose. Yeah, they've got a boat there. - This is going to take all day. - Well, that's what we've got, all day. - Anyway, it's fantastic country. - Fantastically boring! - Do you think he's following us? - He was here first. - I think it's you he fancies. - Oh, for God's sake! This place we're heading for, St Nouverre, is it a big town? It depends on what you mean by big. Well, erm...a cafe... ten people and a sit-down loo. Hey, swinging Landron! (speaks French) We could have stopped for a while in that village back there. Now it's miles from anywhere. There'll be another place further on. There's bound to be. It didn't have to be further on, I mean, there were two places we could have stopped at. We're not supposed to be stopping. It's not that kind of a holiday. I don't know what kind of a holiday it's meant to be. I mean, it's just miles of road, all the same. We never see anybody. We don't meet anybody. We've only been going a couple of days. It's so boring. We don't do anything. - We will. - You keep saying that! - When we get to St Nouverre... - Well, I've got to where I'm going! Why here? Seems as good as anywhere. - Fine. - All right, but just for a little while. - Jane? - Hmm? That delivery last week, you know, the difficult one... The baby died, you know. It was only one day old. I don't suppose they know anything. Feel anything, I mean... when they're one day old, do they? Whatever made you think of that? I don't know. Do you know what they said? Seems such a pity. She wasn't even married. Do you ever think about being married? Hmm? Settling down with one man. I suppose that's what it's all about. It's so forever! I mean, I haven't met anyone yet that I fancied. I mean, not in that way, and there's still so many things I want to do. (speaks French) (radio) Cathy... Cathy, we ought to be making a move. We've still got an awful long way to go. We ought to go now. - Told you I'm tired. - Oh, come on. Look, you wanted to stop, and we've stopped. You've had your rest. Still tired. Besides, I like it, lying here in the sun. - Well... - That's what we came away for. - We can't lie here all day. - Why not? Because you can't. We're miles from anywhere. That was your idea. Keep off the main roads... see the real France. Cathy, we've still got a long way to go, and I don't particularly want to be on the roads after dark.. - Cathy, we've got to go now! - We haven't got to go anywhere. This is as much my holiday as it is yours. If I want to spend a bit of it lying in the sun, then I will. Sick and tired of you ordering me about. - Ordering! - Yes, ordering. Bloody ordering! Can't stop here. You must go there. No sooner do we sit down in one place then we're off to the next. We planned the route together. Yeah, but it doesn't have to be the bible, does it? I mean, we can change plans, can't we? I'm tired, and I'm going to sit here till I'm not tired. If you don't like it you can go... Go on without me. Oh, don't be bloody silly! How can I do that? I'll catch you up. How far would you get on your own? St Nouverre's miles away! There'll be other villages. You said so yourself. Cathy, there might not be. In that case I'll go back. Oh, I see. So that's what this is all about is it, that man back there? Now who's being bloody silly? Anyway, what's wrong with it? We came here to enjoy ourselves, have a good time. I'm not a bloody nun, you know! I like to talk to people once in a while. You're no company. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm no company. Maybe we shouldn't have come away together in the first place! Maybe we shouldn't. You're no fun. You spoil everything. Oh, you're not exactly the life and soul of the party, you know! You haven't stopped moaning since we got here. Either you're too hot, or too tired or you don't like the food! Why don't you go, just go? Yes, I think I will. I think I'll do just that! You obviously don't need me. Get your great fat legs out of the way! - Well, I'm going. - Go on then. Go. I won't miss you. - Goodbye! - Bon bloody voyage. (radio) (speaks French) (radio) Bonjour, madam. (speaks French badly) Lemonade? (radio) Merci. (speaks French) Sorry? Alone? Ah, yes, yes. I am. Bad road. Bad road. Jane? Is that you, Jane? Dear God, no. (argues in French) (continues arguing in French) Cathy? Cathy? Cathy? Looking for my friend. (speaks French badly) I think we'd better speak in English. - Your friend? - Yes. The girl with blonde hair? Yes. We had a row and I left her here. And now she's not here? Maybe she's hiding from you? To teach you a lesson. If you like we can er... Oh, no, please don't bother. I'm sure she's gone back to the village. Did you see her? No. No, but possibly after I had ridden past, it's possible. Oh, she forgot this. Then we'd better return it, hey? Come on, I will take you. - No, it's quite all right. I've got my bike here... - No, no, no. It's no trouble. No trouble at all. - Leave it there, leave it there. It's much faster this way. - My name is Paul, by the way. What's yours? - Jane. Jane. - Lucky I turned back. - Why did you? An impulse. I'm an impulsive fellow. Hold me. Sit down. I'll ask. (speaks French) What did he say? He hasn't seen her, but then he's been inside most of the time. Well, what else did he say? (speaks French) Well, ah...she hasn't come back this way. She's been sitting here more than an hour and hasn't seen anyone. Would you like a drink? Oh, yes. She's gone the other way? I would have seen her. That lady must be mistaken. Cathy must have come through here. When you spoke to him just now, didn't he mention meurtre? That's French for murder, isn't it? What did he mean? Your accent is terrible. What did he mean? You know, I think I was right. She's still in that wood somewhere, hiding from you. Cathy wouldn't do a thing like that. I think I'd better look anyway. You stay here. Wait for me here. When you were speaking to my friend outside, out there, just now, did you mention...murder...meurte? (speaks French) Excuse me. Possible for you to speak slower? (speaks French badly) Pardon, monsieur. He's telling you about the murder that took place here. It caused quite a scandal at the time. It happened about three years ago. About this time of the year too. Poor girl. She's buried in the cemetery out there. Excuse me. May I beg a lift? - How far do you want to go? - To the Gendarme's house. Get in. Thank you. We don't want to lose you. - Morbid interest? - Yes, I suppose so. Loathsome business. She was young and pretty. They always are, I suppose. Loathsome business. It was more than murder, if you know what I mean. Still, she was asking for trouble. Alone on the road. - She wasn't a local girl then? - Tourist. Hiking her way across. Loathsome business. Sex...loathsome. You must be surprised to find an old British buzzard like me here? Everyone is. I'm a teacher. French literature of all things! - How about you? - Hmm? - Where are you from? - Oh, Nottingham. Lovely place. I've never actually been there, but I'm told it's a lovely place. Famous for its pretty girls. I can see why. Did they ever catch the man? Oh, that. No, they never did. Big hoo-ha at the time. They pulled in Jules Lassal. Kept at him for a couple of days. Poor Lassal. They never did name anyone. Personally, I think it was one of her own kind. Another nomad passing through. I've been here fifteen years. They won't get rid of me now. - I like it here. - Oh, please, may we stop? My bike... Thank you. - Funny. - Mmm? That's where it happened. Those woods there. Somewhere down there. Thank you very much. I live about six miles further on. Red tile roof to the side of the road. Can't miss it. It's a big house. Much too big for me on my own. If you should get stuck for somewhere to stay, I can always offer you a bed. Thank you, I'll remember that. Bye. Monsieur, I'm looking for the Gendarme. Have you seen him? The Gendarme? Comprende? Gendarme? Monsieur? (speaks French) Mademoiselle, voulez Gendarme? Yes, do you know where I can find him? Pourquoi...why? My friend, she's missing. Gone. (speaks French) - Aller vous...Go! - Why? Trouble. Trouble. Madam, I don't know what you're talking about. I just want to find the Gendarme. Monsieur Gendarme c'est trouble! I've warned you, mademoiselle. (speaks French) Go! (speaks French) - Madam? - Oui? - Are you Lassal? - Pardon? Madam Lassal. There's no one there. Keep away from me. You lied to me. You lied! There was a murder. Are you going to deny that? No. I won't deny it. There was a murder. Victim: Jan Hele, Dutch National, female, twenty-two years old, unmarried. - Factory worker from Sluis. - Severe injuries to the upper cranial cavity, extensive lacerations and abrasions to the breasts, the loins and the lower torso. Sexually assaulted. Cause of death: asphyxia from strangulation. Her hair was bright blonde, like that of your friend. I worked on the case. Detective Paul Salmont. I am with the Sûreté. Why didn't you tell me before? I hoped it might not be necessary. I didn't want to frighten you. You expect me to believe that? Then what about the film? There was some in the camera, I know there was. - And you took it. You must have... - Of course I took it. Exhibit number one. - Evidence. - Evidence...of what? - I didn't want to frighten you. - Cathy? Back there I found something. No, not that, but something you could identify. Will you? It's further on. Frightened? You don't have to be. - You're with the Sûreté? - Uh-huh. - Their headquarters are in Paris, aren't they? - Yes. That's a long way from here. - Did they call you in specially? - No. They didn't call me in at all. - But you said you worked on the case. - So I did, but not officially. Academically. The case has a fascination for me. I know it. What is it you say, I know it by heart? That's right, I know it by heart. Why this particular case? It's murder... the most unpredictable of crimes. It's unsolved. - Also, I was here when it happened. - You were here? - In the area. Touring, on holiday. Of course I couldn't interfere with the local investigations. I'm not important enough for that, but I could see where they were going wrong. - Couldn't do anything, but I formed my own conclusions. - What are you doing here now? - Touring. Holiday. I come here every year. Since it happened, anyway. Now you have that same look on your face as my friends have. They think I'm crazy too. Maybe I am, just a little, but... - I have a feeling...a feeling... - You think it's going to happen again, don't you? - You understand that? - Is that why you followed Cathy and me? You did follow us, didn't you? I don't know. I honestly don't know. Cathy's got bright blonde hair. That other girl had bright blonde hair too. You think she's dead, don't you? Cathy's not dead, she couldn't be, it was just a silly argument. It was nothing, really. She's hiding somewhere, trying to scare me. She's probably watching us now and laughing at us. Cathy's not dead! Come. We'll see. You and Cathy, you were... you are very close? Not much further. Why did you take that film? - I told you. - I know you told me. What do you expect to find on it? Probably nothing. It's Cathy's film. It belongs to her. I'll keep it for her. Very well. Jane? (radio playing) Do you speak English? - A little. - Good. Thank God! I...I found these. They're Cathy's. - They're my friend's, she's missing. - Her name is Cathy Mercer. I left her in the woods back there. When I went back to find her, she'd gone. - I've looked everywhere, I've asked everybody, but no one's seen her. She's just disappeared. I can't find her. What is her description? She's blonde, very blonde. But that's not all of it. There's a man, Salmont, Paul Salmont, He says he's a detective with the Sûreté Sûreté? That's what he says, but he's lying. I know he's lying. He's done something to Cathy or he knows where she is. Slower... - A man with the Sûreté? - That's what he says. - Paul? - Salmont. You've never heard of him, have you? Salmont? No. I knew he was lying. Something terrible's happened to Cathy and he's responsible for it. That's why he made up that story about finding something in the woods back there. (speaks French) (speaks French) My father... This man... you say he find something? No, he said, but there wasn't anything. It was just a trick. - What he say he find? - He didn't. There wasn't anything to find. - Only those, and I found those. - Where? - In the woods back there. They're Cathy's. (speaks French) - Du bois? - Du bois. The woods, yes. This man remains... he is still there? I don't know. I suppose he must be, yes. I don't know. I will find out. Thank you. You wait here, please. (speaks French) -You're deaf. Oh! - Oui, oui. (speaks French) The war? War medals. (speaks French) Rain? No, surely not. - Did you find anything? - Rien - nothing. - But you went into the woods? - Empty. I find nothing. I check farther on. She didn't go that way. I would have seen her. Perhaps she er... - Hitched? - Hitched. A lift. You did not think of that, huh? You wait. - Wait? - Here. Monsieur? Monsieur? Bonjour. - Lassal est là? - No. Apporte-moi un verre de vin rouge. Hello? Jane? Jane. I want to see you... face to face. Then we can talk and I can explain everything. Jane. Jane. Jane! Jane? I know you are there, Jane. Come out, damn you! Come out. Jane? Jane! Jane! I want to help, that's all. I want to help. But I need your help, because I found something. A bicycle. A Bermuda with a red frame. I found it. A Bermuda, red frame, three speed gears, saddle bags. I found it. Jane? Jane. Jane! Why hide from me? From me! Jane? Jane! Jane! Jane! She's dead. Cathy's dead! And he is too. I killed him. He's over there. I hit him! I hit him! I'll show you.
