THE SCENE OF THE CRIME - What's your name? - Thomas. What's that in your hands? What? Come on. What is it? A knife like that is dangerous at your age. You run, you fall down and you get hurt. Give it here. Are these flowers for your parents? I don't have parents. They're up there in the cemetery. They died in a car crash a long time ago. But... what are you doing here? I'm here with a friend. It's better he doesn't see you. I need some money. I don't have any. Then go find some. Enough to buy a train ticket. You say a word to anyone and you'll get it. I don't like it in here. Let's talk outside. No, don't you try to take off. When do I bring you the money? Tonight. I'll be waiting. Okay. Here? All right. Wait. Not here. That's not a good idea. Up there at your cemetery. No, not there. I couldn't. Down the hill then. What's down there? There's a path by the Garonne. Nobody goes there. Good. By the banks of the Garonne tonight. You better watch out and don't try to fool me... or I'll come looking for you. If I come, you won't hurt me? No, I'll thank you, and then you're free, okay? Go on. See you later. Granddad. I'm really afraid, Granddad. What's that? Speak up. - Finished working for today? - It's Saturday. I'm going fishing. I'm taking this to Grandma. You know, Granddad, something's happened, but I can't tell you. Don't start in with your stories. You've conned me enough with your fibs. I won't have it anymore. Can you give these to grandma? She asked me to pick them and I have to do something now. No, take them yourself. I'm not taking anything to anybody. Yes? Who is it? Here's what I found, Grandma. Hey, not like that. Be careful. Especially considering they're sold. I'm dying of thirst. Let me see. You're really sweaty. Go get changed before you drink. You've got no business in the kitchen. Come on, get undressed and try this on for tomorrow. For tomorrow? What about the suit that Mom bought? Since I saw it, I bought that for you instead. I took the opportunity to get you some things for summer as well. I'm tired of seeing you dressed like a tramp. Come on. Time for a bath. Take that off. A good bath will cut your thirst. It'll wake you up. You're really in the clouds today. Come on. Into the laundry. When you're dressed, I have a surprise for you on the terrace. I just saw Thomas's chest. What a pity, skinny as a nail. Doesn't mean a thing. At his age, I was a beanpole. That's not it. What worries me are his grades. Did you see last semester's? They're terrible. It's not a problem. He'll try harder. It has to happen once. When I was taking care of him, he was first in his class. It's a really big change. His mother just doesn't get it. You know very well, Maurice. His mother won't give him back to you. Ever since she took over that lousy club, it's worse than ever. We've got no influence over her. I think she's not normal. Pardon me for saying it, but I think... You loser, I'm not afraid of you. I'll get you. You'll see. Very handsome. Perfect for communion. - Everything all right? - Yeah. It itches, Grandma. I'm dying of heat in this thing. Don't start. You'll wear it tomorrow. That's all. - Pissing me off. - What did you say? Nothing. I've got nothing to say. Can I go change? Mom's waiting. Stay with your dad a bit. You never see him. - We'll drive you home. - I can't. I've got my bike. We'll put it in the trunk. Come on, sit down. Didn't you hear me? I said come sit down. If you want me to stay here, you need to give me some money. Money? You've never lacked anything. What's gotten into you? He just wants to show off. I don't give a damn about showing off. I don't give a damn about communion, suits, gifts, anything. I need some money. You have to learn that money isn't given away like that. You'll have money when you deserve it, when you've earned it yourself. What you're saying is idiotic. Same as always. You're a real jerk. No, Thomas. Are you gonna stay in there? Open up! Thomas, open up! Can you open the door, Thomas? Good God. What a fright you gave me. What's wrong with you today? He was really upset. Let's see your cheek. The bastard really hurt me. Once I'm gone, he'll be fine. Let's hope this is all forgotten by tomorrow. Tomorrow's a big day for you. No, keep it on. If you make a wish during communion, I'm sure that God will hear you. Really, I'm telling you. On such a day, he wouldn't refuse a thing. You can ask for whatever you like. Today's the day I'd like to ask for something. We have many children at the school, more than 300, and none of them pose as many problems as Thomas. With or without foam, Father? Leave it. I'm very worried about Thomas. - What has he done? - He lies, makes things up, tells tales. You never know where the truth ends and his stories begin. But children are like that. No, in his case, it's willful. He stirs up his classmates. They're afraid of him. I've had complaints. I should be spending more time with him. It's my fault. It bothers me a bit. But he should be helped rather than judged, don't you think? My job is to help him. I'm an educator. I know he's at a difficult age. But what would you have me do? Another beer, Father? No. That would be too much. You may not have noticed, but children are cruel when in groups. Then it's our duty to intervene. That's why we'd like to let Thomas go. Isn't that a bit excessive? He's the one who's excessive, Madame Ravenel. I'll walk you out. Couldn't you make some arrangements? Yesterday, I spoke with Thomas. He claimed that you were not his real mother. He said he'd been taken to your home on the day of his birth, and that one day his real mother would come find him. That's completely ridiculous. It's absurd. That's what I was afraid of. I had to get that off my chest, Madame Ravenel. - I'm terribly sorry. - It's fine. Good-bye, Madame Ravenel. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. It's the dust from the motorcycle. Here. I took this. I'd rather give it back. You're already a born liar, telling unbelievable stories, and to top it off, you start stealing. Let me explain. I made a bet and I lost. You're wearing me out with your baloney. Go do what you want. Have fun, but leave me alone. You're going too far talking to me like that. - It's really unfair. - Be nice and leave me alone. I'd like to make you happy. But I only attract problems. Forgive me. If I weren't around, you wouldn't have it so rough. You could do what you want. I'm ruining your life. Stop talking nonsense. This rage comes from your father. I should've been firmer. At your age, feelings like that would've killed me. You'll be in high school next year. You won't be boarding anymore. You'll learn to speak correctly. After age 12... You don't like how I speak? I do like it. But your father thinks you might slip back later. You know, if something happened to me, you're the only one I'd miss. Listen, I don't care how many lies you tell. But don't you dare think something will happen to you. Nothing could ever happen to you. - Calm down. I was just saying it. - I won't calm down. You know I've never threatened you. But if you brood on such ideas, we're through. You'll go to your father and never see me again. Don't worry, I don't brood at all. Smile for me. Better than that. - Where are you going? - To take a walk. Granddad. Granddad. Damned idiot. You trying to knock me in the water? I need some money. You have to give me some. - What? - Some money. Money? I don't have any money. Go on. Get lost. Don't stand there. What's wrong? Take this, and don't come sniveling about stupid crap anymore. Thanks, Granddad. - Can you take me across? - You think I'm gonna start the engine up? Start the engine up? I'd like to see that. The old tub's totally busted. It'll never start up. You'll see if my boat is busted, you little asshole! Where'd you get the dough? - You tell anyone? - No, sir. I swear. If you swear, it means you're lying. Who slipped you the dough? Leave him alone. Go on. Take off. Yeah, we'll take off. But what about him? Are you crazy? What you want with him? You're crazy. You gotta be nuts to ask a kid for dough. Yesterday it was the car. Today this. You keep screwing up. You want them to find us, don't you? Where you going? You can't just leave. I can't stay. I have to go. My mom's waiting. Your mom? I thought your mom was dead. - What did I tell you? - I swear I didn't tell. I told you not to swear. See your mess? We have to clean it up. Come off it. I'm sure he kept his mouth shut. I'm sure he'll open it if we let him go. Shit! Don't worry. You're gonna go to sleep. You planted those, remember? Yeah. They're really pretty now. You miss it much, all that? Yeah, sometimes a little. Mostly the wind. It's yours. Here. I never go out to that shack. It makes me happy to give a gift. No. Thanks, but I can't. Excuse me, but I must be going. I've got guests. Where did I put my bag? The kid's lucky. He gets to see you every day. I just saw him. He gets stranger and stranger. But you don't see it. You don't see a thing. You're off in your own world. You can't keep a man in your life, so you cling to that kid. It's not good. It's not good. I won't come again. I can't. You'll regret it. Thomas is waiting for me. He can go to your mom's place. She was happy to know we were meeting. I have to go. Saturdays are busy at the club. Tonight there's a band. Oh, a band. Have a seat. I never see you. I gather that your club is doing pretty well. Deep down, you've always had the heart of a schoolgirl. You change your hairstyle? What are you going to do? Make love. What are you going to do for Thomas? That's for the court to decide. You're the one who left. A housewife who packs her bags one morning. It makes a bad impression. It's not my doing if the blame rests with you. If you take Thomas away, it'll kill me. Wait. It will work out. It's up to you. - You make me sick. - I don't care if I make you sick. I don't care. - Stop. - Let go. Just let it happen. Don't be afraid. It's over. You've got nothing to fear now. Are you okay? Wait. You're too weak. - Where's the other one? - Over there sleeping. I'll stay with you. If you let me go, he'll catch me. I told you there's nothing to be afraid of. You're going home now, okay? Home? Try walking a little. That all right? Wait. Nothing happened, understand? Nothing! It's like a bad dream. You dreamed it. Get it? Don't tell anyone. - They're complaining about the smell. - Yeah, I know there's a stench. It's either that or the mosquitoes. - I'd like a drink please. - A drink of what? Don't know. I don't care. I'll have what they're having. They're all having different things. Then bring me everything they're having. - Another nutcase tonight. - What kind? Harmless or offensive? - What does he want? - He wants two beers, two whiskeys, a gin and tonic, a vodka, a Chartreuse and a cognac. He must be really lonely. Excuse me, could I make a phone call? You can't hear a thing at the bar. There's a booth over there. Oh, yeah. For the beers. I don't have any change. Here. We'll settle up later. - Hello? - It's me. Where are you? I think it's Auvillar or something like that. What the hell are you doing? It's all set. I've got the car. I'm waiting. Let me talk to Luc. Stop, damn it! Fucking stop it! I've had it with your crap! You didn't have to kill him, Luc. You didn't fucking have to! Stop! Bastard! Go ahead. I won't stop you. What you waiting for? You're afraid of Alice, aren't you? I don't want to start that again. You wanna die? Is that what you want? Hi, Dad. What's wrong? You know what time it is? Wait. I'll call the doctor. I'm coming. No, don't comel I don't need a doctor. I'm better. Are you sick or aren't you sick? No, I felt really bad, but not anymore. I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I am. Sorry. Don't call Mom. I don't want to worry her. Okay, bye. I said I'm fine, damn it. I was wrong. Don't make a big deal out of it. Not to be rude, but I'm sleepy. Bye. Sure it isn't a heart attack or something? No, he's just plastered. - Should we tell someone? - I searched him, but he's got no papers. That's all we needed. What do we do? I don't know. Go stop that music. My God. Roger, quick! What is it? Feeling better now? Yes, thank you. Much better. Excuse me for keeping you so late. No, it's fine. You come by car? No. You live around here? No, I'm passing through. I'll find a hotel. That will be tough at this hour. I'll manage. No, It's better if I take you. In any case, it's on my way. This is the only hotel. If they see you turn up like that, they might be afraid. Afraid of what? I don't know. Of seeing a ghost. Here it is. Lay down. Good God. What's going on? - Sorry, Suzan. - Not at all. It's good to see you. I need some help. I need a room. - It's for a friend. - A friend? Where is he? Right there. Where did that one come from? I don't know. You pay up front here. It'll be 60 francs. Somebody just lifted my money. I swear I had 100 francs. It's true. You don't have to believe me. Lili, do what you like, but I don't want to get mixed up in it. I'll pay you tomorrow, Suzan. Got a cigarette? No, I don't smoke. But I worked out a room for you. You can get some rest. You really need it. Why are you doing this for me? What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. I must be dreaming, Thomas. It's 6:00 and you're already up. Didn't you go to bed? - Calm down, Lili. - Don't call me Lili. Want some coffee? The more I trust you, the more you take advantage of it. Iron that for me. Why are you shutting me out? I'm not. - Did you really sleep? - Don't worry. I slept well. We always get up early at school. You look like a wreck. Talk about being fresh for communion. No, Lili. Don't get on my nerves with communion. You know, Lili, I dreamed that I died. Cut that out. What's gotten into you? You want me to tell you? Now everybody wants to tell me their dreams. Yeah, go ahead if you want to. I was supposed to bring money to a guy. A guy I'd seen before- Do me a favor, Thomas. Get to the point. Then there was another guy who wanted to kill me. He gripped my throat. I really thought I was gonna die. I woke up, but I was still in the dream. That's when I understood that the other guy, the first one, had saved my life. All the better. Then your story has a happy ending. I'll never forget that guy. He was dirty, with a beard, dressed for winter. He was pale, like a ghost. What's wrong? Nothing. What's all this dream business about? I told you. Tell me again. Come on. And then, he let me go. But I'm sure he killed the other one. Listen. Don't think about that anymore. I'm here. You're out of danger. Why are you shaking? I told you it was a dream. You know, Lili, I couldn't live without you. God, no! You need to harden your heart. If not what will become of you? You should be reasonable. Reasonable and happy. Okay. You need to sleep now. Where did it take place, your dream? Near the cemetery. There you are. You can take off your suit. Communion's over. You're not doing it anymore. Don't make so much noise. My mom's sleeping. Get off the swing, Thomas. You know, confession was last night. We were waiting for you at the chapel. All your friends were there. Maybe you think that a retreat means being up to no good. Do you? - I couldn't make it. - That's highly regrettable. If you think that I'd let you take communion in mortal sin, then you don't know me. Don't do that. My whole family will be there. Then tell your family I'm very sorry. And don't forget to tell your real mother. Listen, I'm sorry about last night. Someone tried to kill me. If you want, I'll tell you everything. Only I have to be sure you won't say anything. Just take my confession. Good morning, Father. Excuse my dress. Good morning. I told you not to leave the house. You're staying with me. No more wandering around here. Back inside. Did you know that Thomas didn't come to confession last night? Last night? Yes, it's my fault. He stayed with me. I was feeling ill. Then I'll have to take his confession now. Yes. It's me. Will you open up? Why do you look at me like that? Have I changed that much? Luc isn't here? You're all alone? I thought you'd be glad to see me. I'm not doing so great. I wasn't expecting you. You said Auvillar. There's only one hotel here. That's all I needed. I've brought this. You never know. They wrote about you in this morning's paper. Listen to this. "Two convicts escaped on Friday at the end of the day taking advantage of the confusion caused by a hunger strike. " Are we waiting for Luc? - It's over, Alice. - Yes, it's over. You managed to get out. I'll take care of the rest. Luc got us out. I didn't want to. You're pissing me off. It's always like this. When it's in the bag, you have to screw it up. Listen. We'll do like we said. We'll go all the way, the three of us. You'll go all the way by yourself. I called to tell you yesterday, Alice, but I couldn't. To tell me what? There's nothing to say. I've planned it out, everything. I knew the route by heart. Pont-du-Roi, the border, Spain. Algeciras, Tangier. Nobody will find us. Nobody. Hear that? A lot of people going to communion. Luc is dead. I killed him. - He still asleep? - No, he already left. Did he say anything, leave a message? Nothing at all. Well, I'll settle up. Already done. What? He didn't have any money last night. Lili, I don't know what you're up to and it's not my business. But if I were you, I'd forget about him. There was a girl who came looking for him in a sports car, a red one. - Know who it is? - A red car? No. But you knew him at least? No. When he came down this morning all dressed and clean shaven, you know who he reminded me of? My brother when he got out of prison. He was white as a sheet. - What was she like? - Sinister. I wonder if they're up to something around here. Two. Four. You could've come to church. Really, that messed it up. I wasn't well. I slept badly. My God. Let's hope it isn't spoiled. You know it came out great. - You think? - Yes, like always. Thank you. Bravo. - Just admire that. - Here. Thanks. You really went the extra mile. I prefer to make it myself to be sure that it's done rightly. Stop eating bread. How do you make that? Here. - You get the honors. - Thanks. I hope you didn't forget to make a wish. No, but it won't come true. Is it a secret? No, but it's hard to tell you. Make a little effort, and make your grandmother happy. Tell us. Don't force him to talk. - If you want to know, I'll tell you. - Okay. Quiet. In each person's life, one must be able to discern the true turning points. That's the most important thing. Today, for Thomas, it's a true turning point, because it's the end of childhood. She really boned up on this. You're going to become a man now. - But what is a man? - This itches. A man is what is born from the heart of a child... just as a child is born from the womb of a mother. Not bad. Today, Thomas has made a wish. Now he'll get up and tell us... what he's asked of the Lord. I wished- I don't know. I wished for someone to drop a bomb on my school so I could see everyone get crushed to death till there's no life anywhere and it's the end of the world. That's what I wished for. Happy now? Come with me for a bit. I'll go get the cherries. Let me help you. There are certain rules in life which you seem to be unaware of. Let him be. That wish is his concern. You can't understand. You're all pissing me off. You're each just as big a jerk as the other. And that kid's just as big a jerk as the both of you. Tell your mother I went fishing. Listen. At least stay for the photo. Please, Dad. If you won't do it for us, do it for Mom. She's gone to so much trouble. It's not her fault. Say something. Listen. Speak for once! We never know what you think. You always slip away. You wanna know what I think? See this thing? This is what I do when a fly bugs me. Can't do the same thing with you, so I shut my trap. That's why they say I'm tolerant. But deep down, it's not true. I put on a little music to liven things up. Father Sorbier ate too much. He went to take a nap. - Here, have a taste, Maurice. - Thank you. They're the first ones. Granddad helped me collect them this morning. Come on. Sit down, everyone. It's not over, is it? Here. It's my turn to make a wish. It's so seldom that we're all together. It's been such a long time. Doesn't matter. I'd like us to be together and happy. I'd like that Thomas could learn to love life, that Lili and Maurice weren't separated, that we could all end up getting together again and that this occasion wouldn't be the last. These aren't as juicy as other years, are they? He'll take the photo now. - The light is nice. - Not right away. Wait a little. Just a little bit. This is so nice. Isn't it nice? That's enough. I'll cover him up now. Wait. What do you want? Shut up. Martin. Martin. Come on! We can't stay here! - Where were you? - I don't know. I went far. - We have to find her. - No, we've gotta run. You could keep me at home for three days. Please, Thomas. There's no more class. We finished the syllabus. Listen, Thomas. Let's not make a scene. Come on. There are all the people you wanted to kill. - They're just like us. - They aren't like us. Watch out. Your dream must have given you these ideas. Stop saying it's a dream. You know full well that it's true. You know, Lili. I don't know what to do. - If I should tell the truth. - What truth? The guy from that night, he might be dangerous. Don't say a thing. Thomas, don't say a thing. Not a thing. Forgive me for asking that of you. Don't say a thing. Don't worry. I wouldn't have said it anyway. Quiet. We need to talk, Alice. We need to have a serious talk. I don't feel like talking. Listen, Alice. There's nothing left for the two of us to do. We'll do everything just as if he were here. I won't let you put it behind you, Martin. That's too easy. You want us to end up hating each other? We already hate each other. We will even more. It'll be hell. So much the better. That's all I ask. I gotta go piss. I'm gonna piss. Would you like to join me? I'll take them. I'm leaving, Alice. Here. Adieu. No, Roger. That's no good. It's still too loud. Of course, if you stay in there. It's better outside. Yeah, here it's nice. But I'll be in there. I don't want my head to burst. Last night they said they couldn't hear a thing. Good morning. Am I disturbing you? I heard music, so I came in. Will you get me a drink? Roger, turn it down. I can't hear a thing. What do we do? What you want. Then we'll celebrate my freedom. Now I'm free, totally free. Are you free? To do what? I don't know. To cut loose and risk everything, to take a leap. You- You understand? That's totally crazy. If you're afraid, say so right now and I'll leave. Listen, Roger. I'll finish this tomorrow. Okay. I'll go then. See you tomorrow. Who was he? The dead one. The man I killed was like a brother to me. You don't have to believe me. I do believe you. She was always with us. Always by his side. It shouldn't have ended like that. I ended up believing he was always right. The club's not open tonight? It's Sunday. It's closed. Sure you don't want to have a drink with me? I do, but inside. Night's falling. Leave the room quietly, please. What do you want from me? I was truly shocked by the wish you spoke of at the table in front of your family. Then I tried to understand, and I reflected on it. It made me think of the Bible, the sixth chapter of Genesis. Where God states, "I will wipe from the face of the Earth mankind, who I have created... for I am grieved that I have made him. " Why didn't God hold to his decision? For it was wise and evident to destroy everything. And then in an incomprehensible gesture... he contradicts himself, and with Noah, starts anew the human adventure. He does it against reason, like an act of madness. That's what hope is. I don't care. I'm leaving. Wait, Thomas. I must apologize to you. This morning before communion, I heard your confession. You told me about two criminals. You described them, and I didn't believe you. I was wrong. That's why I ask your pardon. Is that all you know how to say? I've had it. I don't pardon anymore. And what I told you this morning was another lie. And this, Thomas. Is this a lie? TWO CONVICTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HUNGER STRI KE TO ESCAPE I've never seen these guys. You can tell me tomorrow morning, but we have to notify the police. He used to say there are two types of people. The ones who are truly free are the ones in prison. And now, what are you going to do? I don't know. Will you turn yourself in to the police? I don't know. I haven't thought about that yet. I just wanted to see you again. Seeing me isn't important. It's what you're going to tell them. You have to tell them what happened. That explains nothing. You have to fight. You can't just stay here and do nothing. I don't care about anything. I want to stay with you. You're completely nuts. Go! Go! You can't stay here. Go. Go outside. Here. It's my place. I have one more thing to attend to. Wait for me. Remember how I said, "I'll never love him. " And you said, "No, it will come. " You can see it never did. You said I was fragile, that I needed security, that he was reliable. I wanted to go to Paris. I was ready. I should have gone. But I didn't, because I'd never done anything. But now nobody will stop me, not you or anyone else. Sit down. Please, sit down. I can't. I have to go. He's waiting for me. But not right away. Why so fast? Look at the clock. This damned outage. Can't see a thing. You can't go. I've locked up. It isn't true, Lili. Tell me it isn't true. It is true. It's true. I came for one reason, for Thomas. Go wait for him when school gets out on Saturday. And you tell him- Tell him I'm coming back for him as soon as I can, really soon, to take him with me. Can you tell him? No. No, don't go. You have to let me. You have to let me go. No, don't do this. Please, don't. I'm looking for the man who was with me before. I haven't seen him. I'm sure he came back. He didn't come here. - Got any ideas? - If I did, I wouldn't tell you. Go ahead, help yourself. Hey, I asked you a question. Hurry up. Fuck off! How's that for an answer? Go on, get lost! I'm in a hurry! Quick! He'll kill her. I can't walk any further. - Where you going? - I don't know. Where do you live? Are you deaf? Where's home? I don't have one. Can I stay with you? No, you can't. Why? You going far? Yeah, really far. Turn off the wipers. It stopped raining. - How old are you? - Thirteen. At your age, I was in love with two boys. They were like brothers, and I was like their sister. - We were never apart. - Did you part later? Get out. Wait a little. I can't wait. I have to go find him. And if they weren't around, would you go with me? Sure. For real? Go on. Shut up. You son is safe with his father. No need to stand. I've also informed your family. My family? Yes. Your parents, your husband. Have a seat. You'll need to make an effort and give us as many details as you can. It's essential for us. Details? Yes, the details of the murder. How it happened. I don't know. It all happened so fast. I didn't see anything. Try to remember. No! No! They interrogated you? I said what I saw. That's all. They looked very worried. I was held overnight. They didn't ask you anything? No. They took some pictures. Pictures? Yes, pictures of the house. They didn't touch anything. Wait. I'll go get some sugar. What are you doing? Picking this up. It's a branch from the storm. Leave that. Where you going? To the station. I have to be back before noon. It's not even 9:00 yet. You can't go out like that. You need to rest. It hasn't changed. What hasn't changed? The room, you, everything. Don't hold it against me, but I can't stay here. Where are you going? Your house is being held by- Yes, by the police. You can say it. I need to get some air. See how nice it is outside? You're not going out, are you? Why? Because of the neighbors? I don't care about the neighbors. I see you're not well. I want to take care of you. Take care of yourself. Look at me. I'm not ill. I was ill before. I was trying to live like you and I couldn't. I was always afraid of doing something wrong. What are you saying? You're out of your mind. You'd throw it all away without even trying to work it out. It's as if you did it to spite us. I didn't do it to spite you. I did it for me, for me and for him. For him? He ran away from prison. He's a wanted man. That's exactly why I wanted him, because he was lost. You won't have me believe that you'd fall for such a man. No. No, I won't believe it. You wanted to lose yourself and you've done it. Finding yourself and losing yourself are the same thing. Go away. I'd like to see Thomas. After what's happened, that doesn't seem very reasonable. Just for a moment. No, I think it's better to let some time pass. What did you tell him? I told him you were going to take a trip. That's the best way. Let me see him. He's disturbed enough as it is. I won't say anything. I just want to see him, just for a couple minutes. Just one minute, if you want. Dad. What are you doing? We're having a little screening, okay? Think it's good for you to get up? What do you care? - How old was I? - One. Is Mom traveling alone? Why do you ask? Because last night there were suitcases and she was with someone... in bed. Is that love? You ever talk about it with your buddies? I don't have any buddies. But, yes, I've heard of it. But I thought it was different with her. This home movie is a damn bore. You shouldn't spend your time watching things like that. Say. Maybe she hasn't left yet. Don't you want to see Mom? No. It would be too difficult. It wouldn't do any good. What are you doing? Looking at your collection of boats. What would you like? What would I like? I don't know. I'd like not to go to school anymore, at least not to the church school. I'd like to have some friends. And I'd like to get together with them. Well, you'll have to wait a bit for all that. Yeah, I know. Wait, always wait. No, I mean, what would you like right now? To go for a bike ride if it's nice out. They told me to come before noon. TWO CONVICTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HUNGER STRI KE TO ESCAPE Here it is. Just sign here. Yes, I'll give you the text. Friday afternoon, the director of central station reaffirmed his refusal- That's not how it happened. Just a second. No, he didn't threaten me. I can't sign it. The important thing is what he said at the hospital, before- Is he dead? They're operating on him now. Short of a miracle... In any case, he lied. I knew he was wanted. I wanted to go with him. Do you realize what you're saying? I'm telling the truth. Elizabeth Ravenel, pay close attention. That's complicity with a criminal. Your little joke could take you very far. You've been through a lot. I advise you to get some rest and think it over. I have thought it over. I know who Martin is. I know what he's done. I know it all.
