IMJIN RIVER PORT Nice! -Miss? -Yes? One moment. -2 more servings of eel, please. -Sure. -Miss? -Yes? What's good here? Min-ji! Stand a little to the left. That's it. No photos across the barbed wire. It's a military zone. -Excuse me! -Miss! -Yes? -I'll have the eel. A man took photos there once and the military took his camera. Really? -But the view is so nice. -I see. What did you order? The eel is good here. Enjoy your meal. Why you! Where's your respect for elders! Just eat, Mom! Want me to feed ya? Enjoy. Watch it! Grandfather, first! Father? Say 'ah'. It's delicious! I was going to give him one first. Have lots, Father! Stop pigging out! Watch and learn! Mister! Are you nuts? You can't cut in like that! I'm sorry. I'm weak-sighted. Why are you taking pictures? What are you people! You caused the accident. We'll fix it for you. This is crazy! We'll pay to fix it. So, how much will you pay? Salute! Photos are forbidden here! Give me your camera. Wait… There was an accident! Can't we take pictures of it? Think we're spies? Still, it's forbidden. The pictures are for our records. Let's settle on $1,500. Here's my account number. Sir! Coming from somewhere? Yes. -Hello. -Hello, Ma'am! What a great family. Tight knit, happy and always laughing. I envy you. -Grandma! Why're you here? -Oh, you're home. Min-ji? Isn't Chang-su handsome? Not handsome… But cute. I can't live like this! Then, don't! Is it that hard to water the plants? Why pick wild flowers and try to grow them at home! They're pretty! They liven up the house! Being in the wild is prettier! Flowers have homes, too! Stop messing up the house with wild flowers! Son? That's enough. It's embarrassing. Mother! Mom! Chang-su! But I'm… Dad! Father? I'll carry that. Go on in first. Comrade Cho Myung-sik! Yes, Chief Comrade! Why'd you cut in weakly? What if the accident didn't happen! But the driver could've gotten hurt… Who cares! I'm sorry, Chief! I'll report all your mistakes! Your family in the North will suffer the consequences! Please, forgive me! -I'll change, Chief! -Cut the bullshit! Still… Our mission was a success, Chief. We took lots of pictures. Comrade Kim Jae-hong. Yes, Chief Comrade! Why'd you get scared by the soldier and lose the camera! -I'm sorry, Chief! -If you act weakly again… Beware. Comrade Oh Min-ji! Yes, Chief Comrade! Did you take good pictures? Yes, Chief! Fine. Since we fulfilled our mission I'll let the mistakes go this time. But if you get weak and cause problems again… Beware! Give me a cup of water. What's with your face? Are you sick? Nothing, Chief. Be careful! Don't get blood in the food. Yes, Chief. Long-range cannons. Here, too. They're all aiming Pyongyang. I know. How's it going? I have to report it. Yes, Chief! Why aren't you eating? I keep thinking of my little sister. I feel bad eating well by myself. Why you! Think I'm okay with it? But we have to eat to do our assignments… So we can return home to our families sooner! Stop looking down and eat! Come on! You call this dinner? Just eat what I give you! Or you cook! Always complaining! You always order food! Snacks for dinner? It's this or Chinese food! Let's just eat. She can't even cook without you! Too bad. Why marry a lousy cook! Get out if you don't wanna eat! Not again! Stop it in front of Grandma! That's the result of rotten capitalism. We eat grass because there's no food back home. They don't know how precious food is and just throw it out! North Korea can never be a rotten country like that! Understood? Yes, Chief! Where are my dress shoes? Did you throw them out? Chang-su! Get in. It's okay. Get in. Chang-su! He went in my wife's car. Couldn't the kid wait? Hey! Is it that hard to give him a ride to school? Like you should talk! You just got up! Want some? It's okay. Go ahead, Min-ji. And thank Chang-su. Try some. Comrade Min-ji. Water the plants. An order. Ma'am! Why put your garbage at our house? I did not! See this? I didn't throw that out. It's not me! Yeah, right. They're practically new. Chief Comrade. It's… An assassination. Damn bastards. Should've stayed quietly after running from the North. Why write against our country and invite death like dogs! I'll prepare guns. We don't need guns. Just get steel wires ready. I'll lure him over. Comrade. You finish him. But without a gun… Well, I haven't done it with wires before. -I'll do it, Chief. -No. -You do it. -Yes, Chief. Did you come as a defector or an agent? I can't tell! Tonight's your last chance! You two hide and wait here. I'll approach him and… Why throw out good clothes! They're just $10 shirts! Just $10? Money's hard to make! You know my salary! I bought them with my money! Did you borrow from loan sharks? Crazy! I did not! Just $10? That crazy bitch! $10 will feed people back home for days! Rotten, capitalistic family! It's too short for hanging. To tie it up, it should be longer. So cute! Just a bit longer, then. If you don't have enough, it'll be a problem. You'll need that much to hang it over something. Ouch! I'm sorry. It's okay… Oh! It's you! I loved your book. Thank you. I'm interested in human rights in North Korea. Really? They kill defectors, take pictures, and send them to the state. Some get their hands sewn with wire and sent back North. Do they all end up dead in the camp? If not, they'll be deformed. Or they hold families hostage and force people to become spies. Why write that? North Korea won't approve. Though it's dangerous, someone must tell! I honestly respect Kim Il-sung's ideology. But I think human rights should be protected! Ever thought writing such things isolates our people more? You revolting traitor! A coward who ran away should've lived quietly! Do it! You weak bastard! Have you lost your mind! How can you be so weak! I'm so sorry! Chief! You'd better beware! Comrade Min-ji! Include Comrade Jae-hong's fault in today's report, too! I don't care about me, but not my family… Chief Comrade! I failed at my first time with the wire, too. It's horrifying how they squirm when I tighten the hold. Thinking I'll someday die like that too… So? Overlook this? I won't hesitate again, Chief! Be thankful to Comrade Cho Myung-sik! -Go on! -Send the pictures! Yes, Chief! ORIENTAL MEDICINE HOSPITAL. Here is your prescription, sir. Take your pills regularly. What the! Why throw that in our house? I did not! -Who saw me? -I saw you! Why you! You put garbage clothes back, didn't you? What's going on? They're saying bullshit that I threw something over! Don't curse at us. So what if I did! Acting so good and perfect! Can't stand it! She glares like she has 10 vipers inside! Don't say that about my mom! I saw you throw it over! Did you really? No! I didn't! Don't you trust me? Some husband. Mom! It's a bird. It's still warm. Must've just died. See! It died there! I'm so sorry. Lend me your shovel? -So I can bury it. -Sure. Sometimes… Like that dumb bird. I wonder if we're headed for something that doesn't exist. Even if we were, what else can we do? You must know. You've seen and learned much more than us. North or South Koreans, health is most important. Politics, borders, ideologies… They're just ornaments you put on. Now that I think about it, living and being healthy like this… It's a big miracle. Are you sick by chance? The bird that hit a window and died reminds me of myself. Someday, my family will be happy. Someday. I kept thinking that and did I was told for 40 years. My time is all gone. The ones who gave orders are dead. Though I'm curious, I have nowhere to ask. Keeping it all inside just formed black lumps. I pity myself. Poor me. What's with all this bullshit! Dare compare ourselves to a dead bird! I was wrong, Chief. Corrupted mentalities! That does it. Let's go. Wait! How can you be so pretty burying a bird? You drive me crazy. Sir! Mr. Kim! What are you doing? I'm exercising to build more muscle! -Really? -Let's go! Lend me the sandbags when you're done! It's another assassination. -Who? -A defector family of three. Damn bastards. Why sneak information before running away! Stupid fools with no foresight! This can't be right. That's right. Don't get tied down by emotions! But still. Can't we ask to reconsider? So they'll doubt us? Such pity will come back and bite us in the necks! You have a child back at home, too. That's why! To protect my daughter! Don't you feel the same? -But… -Enough! You get rid of the couple. You! I can't do it, Chief. Please. -I have kids, too. -Think I want to do it! Then, you take charge! I'll do it, Chief. I'll do it all. No, I'll do it. I'll set an example. After it's done… My orders! Follow them like heaven! Hae-min! Hae-min! My daughter! Mommy! Mommy! Comrade Jae-hong will make the report. Good work, everyone. All our lives are at risk here. Did you forget the Shadows are always watching us? Don't look at me like I'm a monster. I didn't do it because I'm afraid to die. It's because of my family. Shut your mouth! I'll report you! You explain it yourself! Chief Comrade! You said you'd set an example! You broke just cuz of that! A weak accident! Unable to strangle! Why yell at them so cruelly! You're just the same! Little bitch! When I strangled her… She thought I was her mom and grabbed my hands. It's not because I'm heartless. It's not because there's a devil in my heart! It's because of my dear family, that poor baby had to. I said, shut up! How dare you act without my orders! If you wag your tongue again like this… Then, I'll kill you! Crazy bitch! Think I'm a money-making machine! $10 is no shit wiping paper! Come out! Damn loser thinks he's big when he's drunk. You don't fool me anymore! You can't even break a cup! Please! Stop it. Mother. Did you hear what this bitch said? You're a crazy bitch with no respect for her husband! When you make peanuts! I'm sick and tired of this! I reported yesterday's work. In recognition, we were granted a day off. Take your phones and go, but stay within Seoul. How about going to the zoo all together? Families here go to the zoo together. Let's pack a picnic to go like a family. Just missing my family back home. I would love to go once. Whoever wants to go can go. -I'm not going. -No, Chief! Forget I mentioned it. And… Write a letter to your family back home. I'll have them sent. Any plan today? I'm thinking of watching a movie. I miss you, Father… Son, it's been 10 years… From your father… Dear darling, I'm… Knock! Will you! I'm sorry, Chief. I'll review it, then send it today. Comrade Min-ji! My daughter Hae-min… You resemble her a lot. I acted out of line yesterday. I'm sorry. Sir! Mr. Kim! -Hello, sir! -Hello. Coming from the hospital? Are you sick? Would you like to go to the senior citizens' hall? Don't want to? Would you like to go to the zoo? What? The zoo? Min-ji! -You waited for me? -No way! But your school is far. I could've gone to you. -It's okay. -If you call, I'd run over. Lee Chang-su! Brought it? No more, huh? Come on dude. Think I'm dumb? Think I'm stupid? Should we kill him? Let's go, Min-ji! Why do you let them? This is the last time! Want me to buy you something? You got money? Right. They took it all. Let's go. I'll buy. -Fine. And… -Yes, sir! I'll be awarding the Azalea team for your work. Awarding us? Why so surprised? I'll do it in the house at midnight. Prepare for it. Yes, sir! Thank you! Who's that? A girlfriend? No! A customer! I wouldn't cheat on you. -Swear? -Of course. If you cheat, you're dead! Of course! -It's so good! -Isn't it? -Come on! -Like it? I'm eating here. You eat. POONGSAN Why didn't you write anything? There's no reply from last time. Something must've happened. Then, I'll ask around. Thank you, Chief Comra… Thank you very much. Comrade Min-ji, what did you do? I met Chang-su by chance and had snacks with him. Was it really by chance? Are you saying I waited for him? Relax. You're acting weird. Don't get too close. And you? Meet the granny? Yes, Chief. We went to the zoo together. Enjoying your lives, huh? Make sure you're careful. Get blinded by love and you'll throw your beliefs to shit. It could be your ruin. Understood? By the way… We'll be awarded medals at midnight. It's our reward for our work. Comrade Jackrabbit will award us on behalf of our country. Where are you going? To the bathroom. So many times a day? What did you do, Chief Comrade? We met by chance at the movie theater. Was it really by chance? Didn't you overhear when I asked him this morning? Stop pestering! Think whatever you want! Just watched a movie? Didn't go for drinks? That's enough! We should watch the news to know what's going on in the world. It's going fine. Stop worrying, fool. Fool? She's crazy again. Stop it! Driving me crazy. Grandma? Where are you going at this hour? Turn it off. Wait. He's about to meet his real dad! Turn it off! Go follow her. It's a chance to get close. Don't get too close. Damn kid is so annoying. Like that annoying kid? No, Chief. Yeah, right. You blush every time you see that damn kid. Don't get too close. Go on. Yes, Chief! Why don't I have anyone? Did you just hear me? What did you say? Even if you heard, it was a joke. Forget it. Hail to comrade Kim Jong-un, our great leader! Hail to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea! Hurrah! Hurrah! Think I want to come? It's cuz you don't keep your promises! I promise I'll pay by next week. Get in the car for a sec. But why? Just get in! Hey, lady! Come back here! Till next week then! Min-ji! Comrade! Wait a second! Salute! What's with your face? Those bullies again? Grandma invites you over. It's her birthday. Sir! It's my birthday! Okay, we'll go. Congratulations, Mother. Happy birthday! It's good. What's wrong, Chang-su? Did you have a fight? He says he fought and hospitalized 3 boys. He's good at punching like his dad! Since when did I ever hit anyone? Remember this? You hit me for throwing some food away! Since then, I couldn't speak to you with respect. When did your wife pass away? My mother-in-law is lonely. Why not date each other? Why you… Think about getting remarried? At this age? Let's just be good neighbors. Well, when's your birthday? I've lost track long ago. Really? That's kind of thoughtless, Mr. Kim. You didn't once do anything for your pretty wife's birthday? Mine's next week. By the way… Please take care of his health. Don't let him go to the hospital. I just went to the bathroom there. I saw the prescriptions in your hand. I saw him take pills at the pharmacy, too. Really? You drink well. Have another glass. It's okay to drink on a day like this. It's okay for her to drink. Right, sir? Yes. Isn't the wine good? I bought it at the mall today. It's not cheap! But I cut your credit card! Don't bring up money now! I had the money. Where'd you get the money? Borrow from loan sharks again? Please! That's enough. Mom? Dad? May I see you for a sec? Okay, we'll stop. So you'll make us kneel again? Mom! You don't scare me! Have another glass! Why you! With guests here on my birthday… We'll get going. Let's go. No, please stay and… Be careful! Are you okay? Everyone sit down! Relax! It's okay! Relax. Why'd you go to the hospital? I had a cold. It's nothing, Chief. When's your birthday, Comrade? It's in May, Chief. And you? It was two months ago. Mine's today! Born on the same day as the granny next door! That's why I drank. You understand, right? Let's celebrate Comrade Min-ji's birthday! But why? Watching Chang-su's family squabbling… Why am I envious? But us! We'll kill again tomorrow for the sake of our country! Strangle with wires! Stop it, Chief. You are drunk. Father? Min-ji? Dear… Comrade! You're drunk. Are our real families in the North? We live together. Aren't we a family? That's enough, Chief! Record it and report me. Getting drunk and saying what's in my heart… If missing my child is a sin… Go ahead! Are you sick? No, I'm fine. The granny is overreacting. What are you doing? What's this for? Please leave. Please go! Get out! We're a couple, but we can't touch each other. We can't lie next to each other. What a sad couple we are. Let's at least hold hands once! Chang-su! What? Did you sleep together? Get her! Min-ji! Min-ji! I want a snack. Sure. You buy. You have money. But… How'd you do that? From now on, don't get hit. Min-ji! Chang-su wanted to celebrate Min-ji's birthday together. You don't mind, right? Happy birthday! We should drink wine in nice glasses. -We can bring them next time. -Okay! It's 9 p.m.! Turn the news on. At a birthday party in someone else's house? Still, we should watch it to know what's going on. Thank you. -Next news. -The news is on. President Lee's brother has been imprisoned for taking millions in bribes… See! Why yell at me for using petty cash with jerks like that! Why you… Next news. North Korean Central News… Reported Kim Jong-un visited army commanders in Hamgyong. It is his fifth visit there just this year. Shouldn't they address North Korea's leader with more respect? What respect for a kid. A kid with a crown surrounded by old soldiers. What is that! Still, he looks smart. Probably why the soldiers follow his orders. Still, what would a kid know? I heard he studied abroad and is very intelligent. With puffy, baby cheeks he's totally a kid. You should look in the mirror! Why you little… He looks handsome and cool to me. Compared to Egypt and Libya, he's doing a good job. They said North Korea will fall with a new leader. But it's fine. That's true. He must have some power. What power? They've never seen better to compare! Stuck in a shell, you can't think straight! Still, I look at it positively. After this year, I think there'll be a big change. Still, it's a dictatorship with no human rights! Humans must live like humans! Sounds like the entire family is pro-North Korean. Just saying! Freedom of speech, you know? Fine, then! The nukes! Why does North Korea make them to keep us anxious? There are nukes all around us. It's for defense. That's not it! The U.S. helps, but they still make 'em! And fire missiles! But the U.S. has thousands of nuclear missiles! Compared to that… That's for world peace! We need to get rid of all evil! Who's evil? Iran? North Korea? Ever been there? They're really good, innocent people. You talk like you've been there. 1 nuke or 1000, if fired everything blows just the same. That's right! Nukes are scary! Japan shut down all nuclear plants after the Fukushima earthquake. Why're you beside Min-ji? You'll get stained red! Come here! We should try to listen to what others have to say. Listen to what? They're all lies! Why're you there, Mother? They're not wrong. 1 nuke or 1000, if it blows we all die. Have some more. See? Our families' opinions are different. North and South Korea should open up and seriously talk. Or we'll never get reunified and keep being used as military bases! At this rate, we'll all get stained red. -Yeah. -Listen! North Korean must open market trades and reform human rights! Stop it, Min-ji. Rather than keep defectors from leaving… They must resolve the food shortage first! And they should stop executing defectors and such! Min-ji! We can achieve reunification. Must we live like this! Japanese colonial, Korean War, who says there won't be another? Right! Why must we consult with the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia? That means we're still their colony! North and South Korea should talk it out directly! Separated families must be so sad. Politicians should smarten up! -It's about our future! -Right! Chang-su, that's enough! -Take care. -Bye. I'm sorry. Well, it's your birthday. But I envy you. That you can say what you think. Everyone forget today and go to sleep. Damn bastards. Some agents! Report their recorded conversation! No matter how much training, they all fall to capitalism. Any word on what I asked about? Did you find out? Nothing happened, so stay focused on your job. Yes, Chief. It's just my wife always wanted to run away from the North. I was worried she tried to… Thank you, Chief Comrade! Wait! Comrade Myung-sik is taking some medication. Looks like painkillers. Comrade Jae-hong's family got caught trying to escape. But even agents' family can't be forgiven for running away. Comrade Jae-hong would be crushed. He doesn't know yet. So, I was thinking… If we do a great deed, wouldn't they let them go? What great deed? Like getting rid of a great traitor ourselves. Who? There are many ungrateful fools to our mother country! I'll find one of the worst. -We should wait for orders. -His family doesn't have time. But still… Trust me! You sure you're okay? Are you taking painkillers? I can manage. Is it cancer? I worried about my family for so long… It's no wonder. Get an operation now! No, Chief. I won't live long anyway. Cancer of all things… The neighbors gave this to us. I just received a personal order. Is it another defector? No. It's a vicious traitor. Who? I'll kill him. You just help. Who sent you? South Korea? Ungrateful traitor! Why would the South kill a traitor like you! North Korea? This is a mistake! A mistake? With the fat of capitalism on your belly… You dare insult our mother country! Wait! Comrade! You're making a mistake! A North Korean general in exile was murdered at his home. He has been providing the North's strategic military information. Unidentified assailants… It'll go well. Comrade, cheer up! Ah, I mean… Good work, everyone. The traitor deserved to die! Why isn't there any word? Did we do something wrong? Wasn't it an order? He's a well-known traitor! Comrade? Was it your own idea? But many agents are in exile on purpose. What if we killed someone in disguise? I'd better go see Jackrabbit. Saw the news? I killed that traitor… Why'd you move without orders! I'm sorry about that. But he was a famous traitor! So, I thought… Don't you get what you did! After years to set it up! You ruined everything! Comrade! You killed off the route to vital, classified information! Know what a big loss he is to us? More than 100 petty fools like you! I deserve to die! Forgive me, sir! Some things can't be forgiven! Then… What happens to us? You expect to live after what you did! The state will decide. Go back and wait! Hello? Yes, sir! Turn it off! Why didn't you finish? You should eat. My stomach hurts. What's wrong? Worried about something? Relax! It's not like the commies attacked or anything! Damn… So? I'll cook and clean for you. I can't stand other men hitting on me. You said, you'd think about it! I have to work. Just go! I have to work. Let's get married. I said, I have to work! I'm… Pregnant. With whose baby? 'With whose baby?' What happened to you? Was I right? I made a huge mistake. We're all dead! Now what? It's all my fault. Soon… We'll be forced to grave punishment. Maybe we'll all… Receive orders to commit suicide? What happens to my father back home? Still, they'll consider all our hard work. Our families should be fine. Why'd you act foolishly without orders? Our families back home could be in danger! Comrade Jae-hong! Stop it! Because of her mistake… Our family could all die! How can I relax! What's this? They're dead. Is it that hard to water plants? See! They died again! Shit. Not again. Why'd you bring wild flowers when you can't even grow them? But you said they're pretty, Mother! Grandma is right! She can't do anything right. What about you! Like you make enough money! You make peanuts! When will you two ever stop! Mom! Dad! Just separate! Chang-su! You mean it? Then, we will! We endure this for you! So, you have parents. Don't do it for me! I'd rather live with just Grandma than see you two always fight! Chang-su! You know how unhappy kids without parents are? Then, don't fight! Please! You call yourself parents! Childish fools! Fine! We won't fight! But you talk to us with respect! Then, you two talk with respect! But there's nothing to be respectful of your dad! Me, too! She's vulgar! And all she wants is money! Think I'm nuts! Then, I won't either! Fools! Anything can happen! Family is precious! In the end, family is all you have! Be good to each other while you can! When they're gone, you'll regret it! Fine! I'll do it. Honey? The plant died. Did you forget to water it? Dear, I'm sorry. I promise I will next time. Mother, I'll buy a new plant. Let's grow it again. That's more like it. No need to fight. Honey? Let's go out for dinner. With what money? Not again! Don't be so cheap! Respect! What respect when you're mad! I knew it! I'll buy roast duck. Let's go! You have money, Mother? Did you give her money without me knowing? -Let's go, Mother. -Off to Healthy Grill! How much did you give her? Tell me! Min-ji! Min-ji! What? -Are you okay? -Why? I saw strange men going into your house. Who'd come this late at night? You woke me up. But I definitely saw them. Did you smoke? I can smell it. No. I can't stand smokers. Go home. Min-ji! Min-ji! Azaleas! Prepare to die! Damn bastards! What did we do wrong! -Are you South Korean spies? -No, sir! Then, why kill a key agent without orders? It's because Comrade Jae-hong… You're making a mistake! Wanna get your families up North killed, too? Accept your fates! Just kill me! No! We got orders to kill all of you! Let me explain! It's too late. Min-ji! Min-ji! Sure you're okay? Are you being threatened by thieves? Min-ji! Then, we have no choice! Min-ji! I'll call the cops. Fine! I'll think about it. Comrade Min-ji! Open up! What's with you! I really saw them go in. Cut the nonsense. Do you have time tomorrow? Tomorrow? Of course. Lots. Let's meet at the snack bar at 2 p.m. Really? Put the gun down! Fine. Why'd you do it without orders? It's because… Comrade Jae-hong's wife was caught while trying to escape. She's at a prisoner's camp. We thought if we did something special, she'd be freed. You stupid bastards! Even agents' families can't be forgiven for running! I ordered it! I'll die and pay for it alone! It's all because of me. I'll die, too! Just spare Comrade Min-ji! Please! Since you lived together, there's loyalty? Fine. I'll make the report on your behalf. Thank you. And Comrade Jae-hong's wife? So shameless. I can't promise anything, but I'll try. Thank you, sir! I'll offer my life to do anything for the good of our country! But, the thing is… It's dangerous for you to keep going like this. If you care for each other too much… You'll all die! Your families back home, too! If you become a family here, your families fall in misery. You're just actors pretending to be a family! And you will dearly pay for your mistake. Of course, sir! Let's go. -Get lost! -I'm never coming back! You crazy bastard! Let go! I can't live with that bastard! Make food for Chang-su first. You make it! You bastard! Forgot what you promised? You said you'd treat me like a princess! That's if you're a normal wife! You don't even know how to cook rice! You can't even do the laundry! You lazy bitch! How can you say that! If I didn't get pregnant, I would've dumped you! Me, too! If it wasn't for Chang-su… The hell did you just say! Kneel! Both of you! Because of me? Sorry. I didn't mean it. Me, too. You were such a cute baby. Remember, hon? He was so cute, wasn't he? Of course! He was the cutest baby ever! Cut the crap! You fool! You can't kick your mom! Go ahead! I'll go around saying my son hit me! -Hit me! You rude brat! -Shit! Why you! Calm down, Chang-su! Kneel towards her! That's enough. Hae-min's been expelled from special school. To work at a clothing factory. Chief Comrade? You must be sad about Hae-min. You must be worried about your wife. Don't lose hope. What happened to your husband? He was sent here like me. He died during a mission. When I first saw Chang-su's family. I wondered why they bickered like enemies. Now, I think that is really living. You're right. We can't hug them or hit if they did wrong. Or yell at them if we're mad. That's what families do. We're like… Emotionless machines. Like clock parts. Then, I'll die like my husband. And never see Hae-min… Hey, lady! Hey, lady! You can't come here! You said you'd pay in a week. You're 2 hours late. Pay up! Pay up! Or else! -Honey! -Mom! How dare you hit my daughter-in-law! What are you doing! Pay back my money! If you used my money, pay back! You borrowed from a loan shark! I did not! Please! Just give me one more day! Cut the bullshit! Still! How can you hit her! Get lost! Dad! Are you okay? Get lost kid! Damn granny! You bit me! I'll get you! Wait, Mister. Let's talk. I'd let go if I were you. Get out of my house now! Back off! Granny! What the! What's with you? Losing to a grandpa! Bastard! Are you going to pay up or not! Don't get physical. Wait! Quiet down. How much does she owe? 30 grand. $30,000? I was wrong. But it's not $30 grand! What's the principle? $3,000! You thieves! The interest is too much. Cut it down, please. Then, $20,000. $5,000 with interest. But that's… You can pay that, right? Yes, of course. That's the end of it. Okay? Everything's resolved. Please go. How stupid. They didn't learn the skills for that. After everything we've seen, the Azaleas have no more use. It's not easy to kill all four at once. They're bound too strong like a real family. If you comrades die, your families at home will be safe. But now, their safety is not guaranteed! It is too cruel to kill the others due to my mistake. Yes! It's your fault! You killed an important agent and caused great damage! And Comrade Jae-hong's wife was caught while trying to run! Comrade Min-ji talks like she has dangerous ideology. And what can the old agent do being sick like that! All in all! You're all soaked in South Korean ideology. You're not worth being agents! The main thing is… You yearn for South Korea's rotten lives! Please! Give us one more chance! Too late. Please! I'll do anything! Anything? Yes! I'll do anything! Fine. I'll give you an order personally. Yes? Kill your neighbors. Your ideology was shaken because of your neighbors! While watching them fight… You all began to miss your families and love. Isn't that it! If you kill your neighbors and change back I'll ask my superiors for mercy. So? Will you do it? Go on a trip together to a deserted island and kill them. Please give us time to think. Do it tomorrow! -Tomorrow? -Yes! Such hesitation proves that you've changed! We'll be watching! If you can't do it, we'll kill them! You and the others too! Please… One more thing? What is it? What happened to Comrade Jae-hong's wife? Think an agent's wife can be forgiven for trying to run? Shit! And his kid? That depends on Comrade Jae-hong doing his duty. Why're you wearing that? Change to this. What are you doing? You made the decision on your own. But the meeting is already set. Mom is waiting. Help me out! Then, just pretend you're the dad! I don't believe this. What do you want from me! I could kill you! What? You bastard! Kill me! You loved doing it with me! How could you! Don't bring that up! After all the food I made for you! Kill me! Go ahead! Kill me! What's this? Give me that! It's a toy! Oh, really? Why's a toy so heavy? Wait! Are you a spy? Don't pull it! Go with me! Mom won't care if you're a spy! Our baby is more important. Okay, let's go. Put the gun down. Dare try to dump it on me! You found out about me, so you'll die. Are you the same loving man who suckled my breasts? Shut up! Fine! Shoot! You crazy commie bastard! Kim Il-sung! Hurrah! Luckily… Your child is safe. But our lives are in danger. Our next target is… The family next door. You mean Chang-su's family? For what reason? They're not defectors or know our secret! It's because of us. But they're innocent civilians. This is wrong! It's because our ideologies changed due to them. It's not their fault! It's ours for being shaken! Min-ji? Grandma asks to have dinner. Maybe next time. It's to thank you for chasing the loan sharks away. Grandma cooked a North Korean meal. I said, no! Please? Open up! Min-ji? Min-ji? I said, no! Why's our princess so mad? Before the Korean War, my mother used to make this. You've tried this, right? I had this many times when I was young. Try some. It's really delicious! Really? You like it? Try some. By the way… We're moving. Two days later. Where? You put your house for sale? It's already sold. I don't understand! Tell me it's not true. Well… On that note… How about one last trip together? Really? Where? To an island. We'll pay for everything. Really? When? Tomorrow. Great! It's our last trip. How about a toast for a fun trip together! Cheers! Here, sir! -Sounds great. -Can't wait. Don't get blood on your hands. I'll do it myself. Still, we'll all have to die. Probably. We'll all die. But there'll not be any more harm to our families back home. Focus and think of your families back home! Comrade! What's wrong, Grandpa! Comrade! Hurry! Min-ji's family is waiting! Honey! How's this? -It's pretty. -Really? -Look. -Let's not fight on the trip. It's embarrassing. Let's talk with respect! Good idea! Really? -Dad! -Hurry up! Look at the sea! -Hurry up! -Hurry, sir! Look at the sea! Min-ji! Hurry up! Come on! Min-ji! Min-ji! Let's play! Chang-su! Mother! What are you doing here? Let's play! Ready? Careful! Throw it! That's it! Dad! Dad! You can do it! Honey! You can do it! Comrades. Stay focused. Pull yourselves together! Mrs. Kim! Can you help me? Yes! I'm coming! Bright faces! Don't forget they're watching us from the forest. Let's have dinner and do it when they sleep. Just come and eat with us. This is not right. Isn't there any other way? I have an idea. Cheers! Thanks for inviting us. That's good! Here you go. Father? We need more wood. Then, let's go. I want to go, too! Me, too! -Chang-su, you stay here. -Yeah. Let's go. Careful! It's windy! Min-ji! Be careful! It's nice to be out. Are you crazy! I'm sorry. Untie us. Untie us now or else! One word from me and your families will all die! How long did you stay in South Korea? -Why do you ask? -I was here for 20 years! I couldn't see my son's wedding and only saw pictures of my grandson. What are you talking about! There are two apple-sized lumps in my stomach now. It's cancer from the heartache of missing my family. Know what I wanted to do the most in my 20 years here? To hold my grandson's hand and go to the zoo! I don't want anything else. I just want to live one day with my son's family. Don't you feel the same? If you're human before agents! So? We can't kill Chang-su's family. You know what'll happen if you don't! We'll die. Let Chang-su's family live! And our families up North! I beg you! Good work! You got so much wood! What took so long? We were bored without you. Hon? Can you grill more meat? With more respect? Grill more meat, please? -Stop pigging out! -Talk with respect! Don't get me started again! Stop it, please! You promised to talk with respect. You heard him! He started first. That's enough! But he started first! The fool! 'The fool'? How about I sing a song? Yes! A song! Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo. Over the Arirang Hills, send me. My dear, who abandoned me. Your feet will hurt before you reach three miles. Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo. Over the Arirang Hills, send me. I never realized what a great song that is. But it's kinda sad. Yeah, it is sad. Min-ji? Do you like me? Do I have to say it? Do you still think of your wife? Sometimes. Not me. All I think about is you. Please don't move away. Honey? I want to sleep. You're sleepy? Then, let's go in. Careful! Don't touch me! Not now! Stand watch while I get rid of them first. Comrade Seung-hae? We need to talk. It's no use. While getting wood, we tied up all the Shadows. Are you insane? We're all dead! And our families back home! It's not right to kill another family for our families to live. Think I'm doing this because I'm heartless? I know you're not. Then, why! Why ruin it! I said, I'd kill them all! But… We killed dozens for years. And nothing changed. Now, let's stop. Stop! It's all over! Why you! Why hit someone who's about to die? It's like hitting a corpse! You're no different from us. Why you! Am I wrong! Watching how South Koreans live… Who is to say you won't change like us! It's wrong! No way! It's bad! The more you deny it, the more suspicions you have! Inside, you'll think why! How long must we live like this? Then, you feel sad and sorry for yourself. Look at family pictures and cry alone! Comrades… Can you honestly say you've never done that! So? We'll follow quietly and die. So, don't be so cold. Bind them! Hold out your hands. Grab 'em! Hold still! 'What's this!' 'Honey! Come here!' 'What is it this time?' 'Is it that hard to water plants?' 'See! They died again!' 'That's not my fault!' 'You should've watered them!' 'Why'd you bring wild flowers when you can't even grow them?' 'But you said, they're pretty, Father!' 'Grandpa is right!' What are you doing? 'She can't do anything right!' 'Like she can grow flowers.' 'What about you!' 'Like you make enough money!' 'When will you two ever stop!' 'Mom! Dad!' 'Just separate!' 'Min-ji! You mean it?' 'Then, we will!' 'We endure this for you!' 'So, you have parents.' 'Don't do it for me!' 'I'd rather live with just Grandpa than see you two always fight!' 'Min-ji!' 'You know how unhappy kids without parents are?' 'Then, don't fight! Please!' 'You call yourself parents!' 'Childish fools!' Shut up! 'Fine!' 'We won't fight!' 'But you talk to us with respect!' 'You brat!' 'Fine!' 'Then, you two talk with respect!' 'But there's nothing to be respectful of your dad!' 'Me, too!' 'She's vulgar!' 'And all she wants is money!' 'Think I'm nuts!' 'Then, I won't either!' 'Fools! Anything can happen.' 'In the end, family is all you have.' 'Be good to each other while you can!' 'When they're gone, you'll regret it!' 'Fine.' 'I'll do it.' I said, stop! 'Honey? Did you forget to water it?' 'Dear, I'm sorry.' 'I promise I will next time.' 'Mother, I'll buy a new plant.' 'Let's grow it again.' 'That's more like it.' 'No need to fight.' 'Be good.' 'Honey?' 'Let's go out for dinner.' 'With what money?' 'Not again!' 'Don't be so cheap!' 'Respect!' 'What respect when you're mad!' 'I knew it!' 'I'll buy roast duck.' 'Let's go!' 'You have money, Father?' 'Honey?' 'Did you give him money without me knowing?' Father! -Min-ji? -Honey. Father! Father! Grandpa! Min-ji. I hope you're happy in your next life. Promise. Mom! Mom… Min-ji… Dad! Mom… Min-ji! Min-ji! No one's home. Where'd they go? They're really gone? How can they go without saying goodbye? Heartless old man…
