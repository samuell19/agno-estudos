Hey. Nice to meet you. M.K. and I were just shooting some testimonials together. Cool, very cool. Skateboarding should be a part of the Olympics. It's like dangerous, you've gotta be skilled. -Yeah. -Whatever, I'm telling ya, it's happening. Denver's gonna have the Olympics within the next 20 years. Yeah, right, they had their chance. Oh, what, they had that false start once? -That's nothing. -Psh. That's my building. Is Jake up there? Yeah, he's probably passed out. You wanna come up? Sure. This is it. Cute! How long have you been here? A couple of months, ever since I moved to New York City. You know, me and Jake have known each other since I was like five, so he told me that he had an open room so I moved here from Boulder. -Aw, buddies. -Yeah. Um, do you want a drink? Only if you let me make it. Okay! I'm not gonna roofie you or anything. That's not creepy at all. Sorry about the mess. -Vodka? -Yeah, is that okay? Yeah. Hottest bartender in six counties. So you pretty much freelance at True Healing and serve at that restaurant? Yeah. I'd rather be on a stage somewhere, but... Sorry, I fucking work at a coffee shop. To shitty jobs. Cheers. May I just use the restroom real quick? Yeah, yeah, it's right down the hall. Make yourself at home. So this is my spot. It's really nice. -Is this cool? -Yeah. Wait, Yuri, did you hear that? What? Yuri, stop. Jake? Jake? Jake, you all right, man? Jesus. Hey, hey! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake, look at me! -I'm gonna call 911. -Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. Call, now, now, now! Jake, Jake! Hey, yes, I have an emergency. It's 171 102nd Street, Apartment 5F. Yeah, it's my roommate, he's throwing up and having a seizure right now. Yeah, I need an ambulance. Hold on. Yeah? I'm an EMT. I was next door and I heard what was going on. Uh, okay. -Who is this? -Hey! Hey, get out, get out. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, no, no, no, somebody's here to help. What? No. No, I don't know what he ate. Go get some water. I'm just getting him a glass of water. No, for him. The guy--the EMT, he told me to get one. What? No water? Hey, what-- You got this under control. They told me not to give him any water. Then don't. Wait for the ambulance. Hey, sir, sir! He's unresponsive, we gotta go. Can you just ask them? They said we just have to wait. I have to go to work at the restaurant tomorrow. You can go. I'm just gonna stay here in case he needs something. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. -I'll pray for him. -Bye. Okay. Yuri. Yuri! Yuri. I'm Dr. Kline. We have him stabilized, but he's exhausted. Hey, dude. What happened, man? Did you notice anything strange in his behavior the last time you saw him? No, I mean... Hey, bud, I'm taking off. Are you gonna be all right? Yeah, I'm good. Feel better, man. I guess he didn't go to work today. We immediately thought meningitis, but despite the sweating, there is no fever and no increased white blood cell count, and that rules out viral or bacterial infection. So what could it be? We scanned his brain. We didn't find any blocked blood flow or inflammation. Did he have a history of seizures? No, I don't think so. Then that leads me to toxicosis. It's poisoning. Can't say exactly what, but something potent and chemical. So is he going to be okay? He's stable. We'll keep an eye on him overnight and we'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Hey, Dr. Kline, it's Yuri Burkin. Um, I'm just returning your call. I was wondering what's going on with Jake. Yuri, I'm sorry. Jake--Jake died this morning. What? He started seizing again at 6 AM, he had respiratory failure, which led to cardiac failure. No, you said he was gonna be fine! I'm sorry, we thought he was. -Why didn't you call me? -We tried you. We're notifying his family. We haven't gotten the test results back, but we're gonna keep you in the loop on this, okay? Okay. Yuri, take care. Hello? I'm Samantha Freemont, Medical Examiner. Can I come in? Well... There's the sweat residue. That's a lot of sweat for no fever. Yum, yum. This doesn't look like any food poisoning -I've ever seen. -No? No. More like ingested anthrax. Anthrax? Just kidding, there would've been fever. So we'll submit this to toxicology. Did he usually eat here or out? I mean, the kitchen was nasty, but he still made food a few times a week. -Hmm. -He had pasta the other night and I saved some of the sauce. I can take that. Maybe something got in it. Rat poison perhaps. Did Jake have a job? Yeah, he worked at a self-help company. It's called True Healing. He shot trauma interviews. True Healing. Any exposure to chemicals or pesticides out there? I don't know, I don't think so. What about drugs? -Was he a junkie? -Jake? No, I've never seen him take any drugs. He's had a little weed, you know, once in a while, but-- Just a little weed, eh? Well, maybe yesterday he decided to try ecstasy for the first time. Took the wrong hit. I'm not seeing or smelling any mold, so mycotoxins are out. As far as the rat poison, it would have to be a whole packet, and I just don't see how that could get in the food. Here's the sauce, anyway. I'll get it to the lab. But I think it's a case of contaminated drugs. I just can't see Jake taking drugs. Well, there's really not much else it can be. Unless it's homicide by poison. When will we know? All right, I live here, I need to know. Well, the toxicology test will be done in two weeks. But listen, I'll do a full autopsy on him within a few days. That may give us additional insight. Okay? Just don't go back in the room. And if you're concerned about the apartment, stay with a friend. Yes, that's why I've been telling you to run every day. I know, I know-- I'm g--I'm gonna have to call you back, Paul. Here you are. Guys, I am so sorry, again, about that wait. Um, I asked for barbecue sauce? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. These fries are cold. -Could I get some new ones? -Uh-huh! -Yeah. -All right, I'll take a burger. Burger, you got it. Actually, no, I'm sorry, hold on, I don't want a burger. -Miss? -Yes? Can I get some more coffee, please? Mary Kate? -Yeah? -There's some guy here looking for you? Yuri. I'm so sorry about Jake. Yeah. So did you take the day off? Yeah. That's good, you should just take some time. I was online all day trying to find out more about True Healing. They don't really have that much online. Yeah, I know, their website's under construction. They've got a few business listings, but there's really nothing there. They're putting together a video library. Psh, yeah, a video library. You know, they're not just interviewing people. I found something in Jake's room. -What? -A bug. A bug? A microphone. They planted it inside of a trophy that they gave him. -Oh, my God, that's crazy. -Yeah. -Why would they do that? -I don't know. Did you notice anything when you worked with Jake at True Healing? Um... no. Not really. I did see some of those trophies lying around. Why the hell would they be spying on people? That guy. What the hell was he doing? Can I stay with you for a while? You can stay with me tonight. -Hey! -Hi there. Alisa, this is my friend Yuri. -Nice to meet you. -Hi. He's a skateboarder. Wow, great. -Sick! -I know, I'm sick. This is great, I've got a houseboy now. What's a houseboy? It's a boy in my house that does what I want. Houseboy, take off my shoe. I'll take off your shoe. And the other one. And now rub my feet. You're funny. Now I need you to open Sparky's skull. Sparky. And hand me my stash. Good housie. Shut up. Stop. I want you to get naked first. Over there. Okay. You okay? Yeah. You sure? Yes. What is this for? They're just from the restaurant I work at. Hate that place. I wanna quit so bad. You should! You're right. They're hiring a replacement for Jake at True Healing. -Already? -Yeah. Nick just sent me an email. You're not planning on doing it, are you? It's just they pay really well. That company, I mean... I wouldn't do that if I were you. You're probably right. Like I just don't want anything to happen to you. You don't need to protect me, you know. I know. Give it up for Jake. A hundred interviews, wow. True Healing, True Healing, True Healing. True Healing. -Maybe it's in the footage. -It's not in the footage, I checked the footage! We don't have it, it's gone. Who knows--who knows where-- Can I help you? I'm here for the job opening. Do you have an appointment? No, I thought you might be able to fit me in. Hold on. Come on. -I'm Jessica, by the way. -Yuri. Nice to meet you. I'm gonna introduce you to Nick. He runs the company. Nick? Hi, I'm Yuri Burkin. And I'm Nick Frankenthaler. I'm here about the job opening? We haven't advertised that yet. How do you know about it? I met a guy at a party who told me about it. What was his name? I don't remember. Yeah, all I remember was True Healing. Well, he was correct. We need a new videographer. Bye, Jessica, thank you. -Bye. -I'll see you later. Atta boy. Yuri. Welcome aboard. -Thanks. -You all right? -Yeah. -Good. -Here. -Thanks. Charles. Quit that. This is Yuri. He is our new videographer. I want you to show him the system, all right? -Yes. -And do it before 10 so we can get him out into the field. Okay, sir. All right. Hey, I'm Yuri. Uh, Charles. I'm the Office Manager and Chief Information Officer. This is the directory screen. This is our video library. Each of these is a video interview. Our video library contains hundreds of interviews about every kind of trauma. So from being in a car accident to having an illness. We monetize the content by selling access to psychological professionals, universities, and companies. So you sell these videos to companies? Like what companies? Um, our primary client is Griffen, a pharmaceutical company. They use the videos for research into trauma and how they can treat it. Ah. Yes, also at some point, we'll be launching which will feature the video library and be a resource to people with similar traumas. Okay. Do you know where Jessica is today? She's not in today. Okay. Let's get you set up at your station. This still has stuff from the last person. Yeah, I'm sorry. So what happened to the last guy? It didn't work out. We had to let him go. So get set up here. Nick wants to train you at 10 o'clock. That was way too slow. You have to speed that up. Got it. Okay, now this city is a cauldron of trauma. There are recent developments that we wanna capitalize on for these interviews. There are specific questions that we ask to prompt these subjects. It's all in the packet. Nothing too complex, but it is vital that you get it right. Ah, Mary Kate. Do you two know each other? No, um, hi, Yuri. M.K. -Nice to meet you. -You too. M.K. is a regular contributor to the library. Uh, come in, sit down. -Here you go. -Oh, no thank you. Let's get started. Yuri, you've just met M.K. for an appointment. Go. -Um, so as-- -Put the mic on her. So, as you know, we're looking for a story about a recent trauma, like an injury or an illness. It can be something which happened to you or another person. Something which happened to another person? Yuri, roll camera. Um, not recent, but... So there was this one time when I was probably about 10, and my mother had kicked me out of the house for no reason, so I had to go and live with my two neighbors, Bill and Rita. They were pretty cool at first, but Bill had this record collection down in his basement. One day, he took me down there to look at it. I should've known. So I'm looking at one of the records... and Bill comes over and he starts touching me. I'm really scared. And so he just starts putting his hands all over me. Down my pants and everything. I thought it was over, and my face felt like it was burning. And then he takes his dick out... and he makes me open my mouth and he shoves it in and starts thrusting back and forth. And it just--it hurt so much. And then he finished. And I was crying. And he told me never to tell anyone. And I didn't for years. Did you ever tell the police? Stick to the script. No. So he's still out there? Yuri! After this happened, what effects did it have on your life? It ruined it. And it wasn't the only time it happened. What's up with these questions? Excuse me? How likely is it that your trauma might happen again? Very. It's like I have a sign on my head that says, "Come violate me." Have you ever considered medication? I've thought about it, but I don't want to try it. I cut myself instead. What? I'm a cutter. I have a razor in my bag. Why? Goddamnit, Yuri. 'Cause it makes me feel better. I actually keep some blood in my locket to remind me. Shit, M.K. Okay, we're done here. Cut the camera and come with me. I don't know what you were trying to pull in there, but stick to the goddamn script! Yeah. These questions have been carefully calibrated to get the information we need. I don't care how awkward you feel. Stick to the goddamn script! Yes, sir. And I don't want you making personal connections with these subjects. Got it. All right. Thank you. You'll be going out to Queens for this one. Your first subject's name and address. He knows you're coming. Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Hey, M.K. That was pretty intense in there. I hope you're okay. I didn't know you had been through anything like that. It's cool, I'm not bugged out or anything... if you wanna talk about it. Call me. Hi, Gene? I'm Yuri. Come in. Thanks. You ready? Pills... not... working. Wait, the pills they gave you? Was it Sedinox? Shit. Hello? Yuri, it's Samantha Freemont. Hey. There's been a development. I hope you haven't been back into Jake's room. Uh, no. Good. We did the autopsy this morning. Okay. We were looking for signs of toxicosis. Damage to the throat, the stomach, the intestine. It wasn't there. So it wasn't poisoning? No. When we opened up his skull, Yuri, his brain, there were tiny holes in his brain. Holes? Yes, like a sponge. He died of an encephalopathy. Like mad cow disease. But this one we've never seen before. How does it spread? We don't know. These prions that cause this, they're tiny little proteins, they're smaller even than a virus. They could be spread by eating, body fluids, or even a cough or a sneeze. That's not what I want to hear right now, man. I'm in the fucking apartment with a guy that has that shit. What? Yeah, and there's a guy outside who's spying on us. Well, give me your address. I'm gonna come over with some backup. Hi, yes, I have an emergency. 50 East 31st Street, apartment 3F. Yeah, I got this guy, he's got this brain disease. He's sweating, he's gonna start puking any minute, and then he's gonna have a seizure and fucking die. You have to come now. Come now. EMT! Aww! Fuck you! Oh... -Hello? -When are they getting here? -Five minutes maybe. -Shit! -The guy's gonna get away. -Who? The guy. Fuck! Dr. Freemont, I figured something out. It's True Healing. You gotta call me back as soon as possible. Dr. Freemont. I figured something out. It's True Healing. Hello? Hey, it's me. Let me in. Yeah, the medical examiner, she told me it's a new disease, it like, um, puts holes in your brain, makes it like a sponge. So there were holes in Jake's brain? Yeah, that's what she said. He said he was getting headaches. Yeah, these assholes are the reason he got it. True Healing knows about it. They've known about it. What do you mean? I mean the whole thing! The appointment, the interview. The whole reason I was there was to mic Gene. And as soon as he started puking, that biker was right up. So True Healing is like a sham? Yeah, I mean, they don't give a shit about people's trauma. They're targeting people with this disease. I knew those guys were full of shit. They never cared what happened to me, they just wanted to know about Chris. Chris? Chris, yes, he-- he worked at the restaurant and he died too like a month ago. That must be why True Healing first contacted me and started doing interviews with me. They wanted to know about him! So they were asking you about him. Yes, yes, they asked me-- they asked me what he did before he died and all that. And they had asked me if I went to his funeral. They're tracking the disease. That's why they're following you. To see if you're infected. They're tracking me too. They must be doing something illegal with those samples, otherwise they wouldn't need to be so shady about it. What if they're selling it to terrorists or something? God, this is insane. It's gonna be all right, baby, I'm gonna figure it out. You're going back there? Yeah. Don't try to be a hero, Yuri, you're gonna get us both into trouble. I won't, I promise. This is New York City, not Bumfuck, Idaho. You don't have a clue. Those guys killed Jake, okay? I'm not gonna just let that slide. Whatever, just don't get yourself killed. -MK, you don't have to go yet. -I'm late. Hold on. Charles. Oh, God. You frightened me, Yuri. How were your interviews? Fine, except one of the dudes threw up and had a seizure halfway through it. No way, he got sick? Yeah, I was right there. Now I'm coming down with something. No, no, Yuri, you-- no, you're, um... you need to... I shouldn't, um... Why you bugging out so much, Charles? Do you know something that I don't? No, it's simply that I have a thing about germs... -and I'm concerned. -You don't like germs? -No, but... -You don't like germs, huh? So, uh, wouldn't be good if I came up close and started breathing all over you, huh? Yuri, Yuri, please, Yuri, Yuri, please. -Please, please, please. -What's going on out here? Why don't you tell me? Tell you what, Yuri? What's going on. Why was I in a room today with someone with a deadly disease? You had a bad interview, I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know? Listen, dude. I saw everything, I know everything. And on top of that, I have it on video. You got 10 seconds before I call the cops. Unless you wanna tell me everything you know about this disease. Step inside. It's just precaution. Yeah? Why didn't I get one of those? We had no way of knowing your subject would be sick. Bullshit. You knew he might have it, but you weren't sure. That's why that biker was downstairs, waiting to get a blood sample if he was. I told you, I got everything on video. Where's the footage? Tell me everything you know about this disease. Has anyone else seen that tape? Maybe. How you feeling, Yuri? Getting headaches? You're infected. You can feel it. So you go ahead and threaten me all you want. All you're doing is digging your own grave. Well, if I'm gonna die, then I might as well take you down with me. You don't have to die. We have a prototype treatment for the disease. Who? Griffen Labs? What do you think we've been doing? We're trying to save lives. I can save your life. But you gotta give me that video. Good choice. I have a dose of the prototype here. We can take care of you right now. Have a seat. This has done very well in all of our trials. Give me your arm. Yuri, do you want the treatment or not? Excellent. Stop him, Charles! Charles! That way, hurry! Yuri? Uh, Nick! Nick. I got everything I need now. Hello? Yuri, where are you? Yeah, I'm in Bushwick, near True Healing. We're nearby. Give me the cross street. I'm on Thames, approaching Varick. Stay there, we're coming. Yuri, I asked you to stay in the area, and instead, I find you on a street corner in Bushwick holding a syringe. Sorry, I had to bring down Nick Frankenthaler and his whole corrupt operation. They're doing dirty work for Big Pharma. This is audio and video evidence. Hmph, well, look at you. Listen, as a matter of fact, I've got some officers heading over to True Healing right now. Good. -This is Atkins. -Howdy. -What's up? -That's Jones. I brought in the EIS, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, 'cause this situation is just way beyond my jurisdiction. Well, that's what we're here for. So what you got there, bud? Nick said it was a prototype treatment for the disease, I don't know. Prototype. They might have a compound they're testing out on this new prion disease, but I wouldn't inject that under any circumstances. Why? Most of these compounds have horrible side effects, or they can even speed up the progress of the disease. I think I'm gonna have to take it anyways, I... I think I have the disease. Okay. You may or may not. But we're gonna set up a hospital for you and anyone else who might be infected. Tell you what, give us a few hours with that syringe, we can get a better idea of what's in that before you start injecting yourself. An encephalopathy. Like mad cow disease. Hey, why are we here? I need you to go up and lay low for a while. Put on some tunes, relax, drink a bunch of water while we set up this facility and run that lab test. When will you guys be back? Give us two or three hours. Here, put on this mask, and don't leave your apartment, we have to contain this thing. Fuck! Yuri. Yuri! Yuri! You're dead. -Hey. -Hey. What's with the... I'm sick with what Jake had. Are you having headaches? Yeah. It's bad. Why are you here then? I wanted to see you. I, uh... I got all this evidence against True Healing and gave it to the medical examiner. What did you find out? They've been collecting samples of the disease for a pharmaceutical company... probably to make a drug for it. So they knew about this disease starting to happen and they didn't care. They just let people die. Right. Like guinea pigs. Oh my God. Now I mean they won't be able to do it anymore because of you. You're a hero. Hey, what's up? Um, this is my friend, we were just talking. -What was your name again? -Roger. Hi, Roger, I'm MK, and this is Yuri. What's with the face mask? I'm sick. With what? You don't want to know. So is this your soccer jersey, Roger? Yeah, I'm in a league. Play three times a week in season. So you're a big jock, aren't you? Yeah. Let's go get a table, okay? Get us a couple rounds. Sounds good to me. ♪ It doesn't matter ♪ The point is that it's good enough ♪ I gotta go. -Yuri? -I'm leaving. Yuri, wait. -Wait, wait, don't go. -Roger. So what, are you gonna stay with this guy all night? Yuri, come on, don't be like that. Are you trying to have another traumatic experience? I mean, this guy's a fucking asshole. What? I told you, you don't need to protect me. I just care about you. Came all the way here to see you, and it's just I'm all messed up. If you need to go to the hospital, you should. I'm just trying to have some fun, okay? Fun, yeah, I get it, I just thought we had something. We went out a couple of times. All right, I gotta go home. -Yuri. -I'll talk to you later. Don't worry about him. ♪ Everything that you do ♪ Is good enough, you're good enough ♪ ♪ Just the way you are Yuri, shit, I told you not to go out, and what the hell happened to your mask? I know, sorry. You know, you are not making my life easy. Now, gimme your keys. Get your diseased ass out to our van. Jones, clean up this apartment. -All right, you, get in there. -Wait. What happened with the syringe? It was water. You guys going to the hospital too? Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. This ain't a free ride. We need some intel from y'all. Now, all we know about this bug is that it's a cousin of mad cow, but we have no idea how it's transmitted. Any ideas? Yuri, think back. When do you think you were exposed? Yeah, okay, uh... It wasn't at Gene's, I had the headache -before then. -Right, had to be. Fuck, okay. It must have been at Jake's when he was dying. Hey. I think I touched some puke. Did you have a cut on your hand? No, I must have, must have... Eaten it? Yeah. Two and a half, three days. Timeline makes sense. Vomit transmission. -No. -What? We looked at vomit transmission and it didn't pan out. -Charles! -Nick? Thanks to the graciousness of the NYPD, your friends from True Healing are back there. The more they cooperate with us, the better they'll do with the judge. I'm not saying anything. Charles. -Hey, Charles? -Yuri? -Tell me what you know. -No, Yuri. -Yuri. -I'm gonna infect you. -Yuri, please! -I'm gonna infect you! I don't know anything, okay? It's Nick, Nick knows! If you say one more word, Charles, I swear I will kill you. He can't do anything to you right now. He won't hurt you, don't be afraid of him. Charles, I took you in. -I gave you a career. -Don't listen to him, he's manipulating you. You could help us right now. You could stop this. We were monitoring the disease. Oh, you are dead! -Shut up. -You fucking little snitch! Shut up, shut up! We've been tracking this thing ever since it broke in Brazil. We think the first case was in a farmer outside of Saão Paulo. -No, Charles... -Then we got word that it came to New York. So Nick made us relocate here. I could never figure out the transmission. But it wasn't always spread through the vomit. Because the first two cases in New York, Abe and Chris, lived in different boroughs and didn't know each other. But if you didn't know how it was transmitted, how did you know who to interview? I would crunch the data. Nick would decide who we should follow. Nick, how did you decide? You're such a fucking piece of shit. Charles, hope you didn't get hung up on this vomit question. You know, it's fully possible that Yuri was exposed when he touched the vomit, but these other guys, the ones before, they could've had a totally different ingestion exposure, like... maybe they ate at the same restaurant. The same restaurant. Chris worked at MK's restaurant. That's right. Chris Pondorf worked at the Swan Diner. It's possible that Abe came out from Queens to eat there. Yeah, Jake ate there too! I saw an interview that he had with MK there. That must be it. It's a lead. Yuri, can we stop by there on the way to the hospital? If we can figure out this transmission, it might give us a clue for your treatment. Yeah, let's do it. All right, you're on the front lines of this thing. Put this on. Can I help you? Yeah, Tom Atkins, CDC. We have reason to believe that this restaurant might be a reservoir for a new disease. Are you talking about what Chris had? Correct, Chris Pondorf. Do you know of anyone else who got sick after eating here? Uh, no, I don't think so. This guy. Did he come here? I never saw him. Could ask MK. She's the other lead server here. She also knew Chris better than I did. Wait, how much better? They got together outside of work sometimes. Excuse me. Thank you. -What? -Atkins, is it possible for somebody to have this disease and not die from it? Uh, yeah, an asymptomatic carrier. I don't think it came from here. Come on, MK, pick up. Hello? Hey, it's MK's friend Yuri, is she here? -No, she's out. -Dammit! Um, can I talk to you for a minute? It's serious. Hey, can I ask you a couple questions about MK? What is this about? Have you ever seen this guy before? Yeah, he works for that True Healing company, he's been here a few times. Fuck! Um, do you think he ever had sex with MK? I mean, probably, the door was closed, but I think so. -I'm sorry. -No, no, no, it's not that, it's--here, look, have you seen this guy before? Yeah, I went out with her last week and she went home with him. Fuck! Fuck. Um, okay, listen. MK has a deadly new disease, all right? And she gave it to those guys, and other guys around the city, and now I have it, all right? -I need to get a hold of her. -What? Look, the first guy I showed you, he died from the disease, okay? The second guy's in critical condition in the hospital, now I have it, I need to get a hold of her, I need to contact her. She won't answer my phone calls, can you call her for me? -Please, please? -Yeah, yeah. -Hello? -Hey, MK, what are you up to? Uh, not much. I met this guy at the bar. Oh, are you busy? When are you coming home? Uh, I think we're gonna go over to his place. Um, can I have his address, please? Why? You know, sometimes I worry about you. Oh, that's sweet, hold on. What's your address? It's 180 Lexington Ave., apartment 4B. 180 Lexington Avenue, apartment 4B. Okay, got it. Okay. I'll see you later, Alisa. Okay. Thank you. A sexually transmitted prion disease. I'll be damned. Well, guess I don't need this thing anymore. -Whoo! -Fuck! I got some extra strength aspirin if you need it. No, I just can't believe she fucked them all. I fucked her without a condom on. Fucking idiot. Don't beat yourself up too hard. Things just got a whole lot better for you, bud. Think about it. If she has it, isn't showing any symptoms? That means the disease doesn't kill everyone. Right, right, yeah! Go faster. Come on in, don't be shy. -Thanks, I'm not. -I know. This is it, my humble abode. It's cute. How long have you been here? About two years. Can I use your bathroom real quick? Yeah, it's uh-- it's right through there. I don't understand how she could have it and not have symptoms. We've already seen that the immune system doesn't activate for this disease, and it's very possible that the disease prions are in her body lying dormant. They're just not triggering the way they do in others. She must have noticed that everybody she was sleeping with like dies. Maybe. Denial is a powerful thing. In the 1900s there was a cook named Mary Mallon, Typhoid Mary. Asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever. She used to cook for these families and of course inevitably, they'd all get sick, but she denied it to the very end. She didn't want it to be true. Oh, wow. If she is an asymptomatic carrier, that means that there's something in her DNA or in her blood that makes her resistant, and if we can get a sample from her, we can isolate that resistance and use it with you. It's your best shot, bud. No, no, no, if she sees that, she might run. We'll keep it in here until she's agreed. Yeah, okay. Are you expecting someone? What? No. Yeah? Uh, Roger? Yeah? Who is this? It's Yuri from the bar. I need to talk to MK. Dude, she went home with me. Yeah, I know, man, listen, all right, she's dangerous. Dude, get outta here, all right, man? No, no, no, let me in, man! Jesus, what the fuck is this guy's problem? I don't know, he must be real jealous. I don't give a shit. I want you so bad. -Who is it? -Uh, delivery. Centers for Disease Control, open the door. Tom Atkins, CDC. Were you having sex with her? Yeah. Where is she? Dude, what the fuck you doing, this is my apartment! What is this? Get the hell out of here! Listen to me, all right, it's you! You have the disease. You're the one that's been spreading it. -Is this for real? -Shut up, Yuri, -that isn't funny. -I'm serious, all right? You had sex with Jake, didn't you? This is so stupid! We aren't boyfriend and girlfriend, you know, -sorry. -I know that, all right? It's about the disease, okay? Either you slept with him or you didn't. It is none of your business. Uh, unfortunately, it is. Who is this guy? What does he look like? He's tracking the disease. Well, you know what? Sorry, you're looking in the wrong place, -I'm not sick. -I understand that, but there's a very real possibility that you're carrying this disease without showing any symptoms. -What the fuck. -That's crazy, that's not possible. Yes it is. He's right. MK, it's... MK, you must have known. Abe? Chris? Jake? They all died. What? I didn't have sex with Jake. No, no, there's something between both of you. That first day in the park. You weren't just friends, all right? I pretended not to notice but it was there. I didn't have sex with Jake. Yeah, but did you do something else with him? Right, right, you lied to me. You said you were just friends. We were just friends. I didn't want to upset you. Upset? Goddammit, I fucking loved you, all right? -I trusted you. -You didn't love me! You just wanted to screw me until you got sick of it and then be done with me. Sorry to interrupt, but we need to get a blood sample from you. Why? To test it to determine if in fact you're carrying the disease. It could help us find a cure. Well, what if the test shows that I have the disease? What's gonna happen to me? Some more tests. Give some more blood, no one's gonna hurt you. Look, I don't blame you, all right? It was an accident. I think I'm gonna be sick. So what does this disease do? Um, you have trouble sleeping... get bad headaches... memory loss, hallucinations. Then what happens? You get real nauseous and you throw up a lot. Then you get a bad seizure. Until you stop breathing. What's she doing in there? I didn't hear her flush. MK. Hey, MK. Shit! She went out the window. MK, stop! Don't run away from me! I'm fucking dying! Stop! Yuri. Hang in there, bud. One, two, three. Hold him down. Easy, easy! Nurse? We need to get the blood out of this locket ASAP. Yuri, you're up! Easy, easy. You are very lucky.
