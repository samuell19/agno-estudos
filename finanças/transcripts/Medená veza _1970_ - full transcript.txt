I will tell you a story from Stratená Valley, which ends at the place where the sky begins. Here, we know every rock... and each rock knows our hands. Each spring we returned to our valley like birds after winter. Nice... This is our nest, this is our castle. And my friends. Jožo Belej, nicknamed Pirin, and this handsome fellow, Valér. - Bless you. - Go to hell. Thank you. We hated lofty words. It was enough just knowing this was our home, our roots were in this piece of earth. This was our cradle, and our grave. We left people with their hardships down below. This was a world of freedom and peace, eagles flew around the mountains. And we were young and light like angels who were not scared of falling. We were good friends and we were having a great time. But now I know something we were not aware of back then. That man can hide from people, but never from oneself. Everything was still all right. We painted the kitchen and Valér swore every single woman will like it. A woman. All alone. What is she like? A blonde in a purple sweater. And nicely gone crazy underneath. - What about her face? - Who cares? Go ahead. I won. The blonde is mine. What is mister doing that for, I wonder. Are you all right? It is all for the lady. I just tore this for her. Thank you very much. Oh, it smells so nice. Very nice meeting you. Unbelievable. That stupid rose always works. Jesus Christ. It's a lot of work to lose all one has. Hey, Valér. What's the difference between you and a cannibal collecting dried-up skulls of his enemies? You guys are just jealous. Women, money, everything. Really! Valér is always lucky. He never lacks money or women. Most people feel a natural urge to observe the law. But Valér had always felt an urge to break it. I hope they'll catch him one day. Look at how late he is again. What a terrible person. Honestly. Wakes everybody up and he's drunk. Go to sleep. While you sleep, I work. Here, and stop bugging me. Well. - Maybe we should report him. - Well. - Right, that would settle the matter. - Well. If you betray a friend, your nose will rot, your tongue will turn black, and your face will change into your ass. The choice is yours. Wait. Not that one. - Why? She's the best one. - That's the thing. - Let's throw. - I'm not playing. They're leaving anyway. Come on! - I won. - I didn't see that. - You did, right? - He was cheating. - Congratulations. - It was on the edge. Let me throw, then... What a primitive method. Have you got a serum? They didn't send us any. Everyone leave. - Come on. - Please. Come on. It's just a snake. It's like a honey-bee. - There you go. - Don't worry! Get lost. You too. - Is it going to hurt? - Just a little. Our friend's medical treatment had a surprising effect. I was the best man. The second best man did not make it to church. He was held up at work. We have to paint it over. - Paint it over? - Why? What will people say? Since when do you care? Those are my footsteps. The way I came, got lost... - and stayed... - Do you like it, Saška? Yeah. Well, if missus likes it, mister has to like it too. No painting. Since there's a woman in the house, I work my butt off. He's gone mad. He even wears pyjamas now too. Look. I put this here for you. Do you like it? Well... It's a lot of work to lose all one has. I do like it. I put all your young ladies in here. They were collecting dust. Right. And... Why don't you get us embroidered shirts? Well... It's over now. We had such a nice life here. A friend is always right. Even when he's wrong. Everything's going to change. It will suck. You'll see. She won't let me go. - She saw a green dog in her dream. - What? She's worried about me. She said a green dog is a bad omen. Let's go. We're two too many, can't you see? Have fun, you green dog. Saška, she was a foreign element. A beautiful germ in Stratená Valley, and in the bloodstream of our friendship. One person was missing on the rope. And all of a sudden we felt like orphans. Are they asleep? No. - Don't worry... - Be quiet! - Shall I go over? - Okay. Be quiet! What is it? You're not sleeping? I think the wind is tearing at the roof. We'd better take a look. I don't get any sleep since he got married. I can't fall asleep if another lies next to a woman and it's not me. Get married, she'll be there all the time. - You're here? - No. Give me a smoke. We'll have to come up with something. Yes, but what? PRIVATE APARTMENT Welcome, dear guests. Gentlemen. After you. Okay. Come on in! Will you stop that? Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you and thank you for your understanding and your patience. Yes. Welcome to our new home and let me drink to the health of the hostess. I think the visit is over. Wait! See that? - Let's go. - Why? That's Saška! So what? She's still all his. You pig. A friend's wife is sacred. It's like a holy cow to an lndian. - I'm no lndian, you idiot. - Cut it out. Let's go. If Pirin saw us here, he'd beat us up, poke our eyes and kick our asses. Hey. You hooligans. What are you up to? I can see you. Come on out, gigolos. Come closer. Don't be shy! Hand me my clothes. And close your eyes, please. Both of you! Put it on the rock. And turn around. Both of you! Don't you dare peek. - Where's Pirin? - He's on a date. I gave him a day off. Please sit. I'll serve you in a minute. Interesting! What an original idea. Hey, Saška? - Don't tell Pirin... - Don't tell what? Don't tell him we spied on you. A real man's always curious like that. Perhaps this was the moment when we really accepted her like our own sister. And came to terms with what had come along with our friend's big love. We started teaching her new things, when people hang on the same rope with the other person's life in their hands. You must have three stable points: Two feet and one hand, or the other way around. - Three stable points is the rule. - One is enough for me. I wonder who gave the names to these hills. Like that one... Frog Horse. - But why? - They must have named it after you. What a view, I hadn't expected this! How can I help you? - Two large cognacs. The best you've got. - Please. - Here you are. - One's for you, madam. I don't drink, sorry. Our colleague doesn't drink on duty. Thank you though. Cheers. Saška was not to blame that there were other men. They were all over her. So what if the guests like her? It's good for the business. We'll have bonuses. To hell with that. My wife is not some... I just can't stand it. What is it you can't stand? What it is? You smile and listen to that stupid talk. Do you like it? You're a married woman. - Should I stop talking to people? - Not to people, to men. What do you want from me? I'm not dumb. Do as you please! It's up to you. All right. I think you'll be happy. Where're the four soups, please? Will be right there. Oh, and do you know what should the weather be like later today? Oh, thanks. I understand. Partly cloudy. Thanks a lot. Did you see? So pretty and such a tragedy. Excuse me... Please. - Was she born like that? - She was born out of wedlock. An unknown tourist left her in the hills. Please. - The child was raised by a mother bear... - Terrible. - She never learned to speak. - Just like Tarzan. Enjoy your meal. A she-bear? What a great story. But out of wedlock, it's a bit too much. - Why? It adds some thrill. - Besides, it's true. - What's true? - That my parents were not married. Really! - Why haven't you told me? - What? That you don't know your father. I forgot. It's not that important, is it? It isn't but I want to know everything about you. You're a man and men never need to know much. - I don't like this. - What? Many things. Like pretending she's dumb. It's cruel. Oh, well. Pirin is right about that one. You can't give a woman too much freedom or you'll turn her into a slut. Enough of that. Go to sleep. Maybe I'm wrong but I have a feeling that Pirin is not doing justice to this big love of his. Big love. Should I envy or pity him? Since their wedding, Saška has not gone down to town once. She's spent the whole summer in the valley. With calm autumn days she started going on mysterious trips. HAVING MY HAIR DONE What do you think? Well? You don't look like you. Where have you been? I was craving sweets. Seven hours up and down for three oranges? I've eaten two on the way. Catch. Could you say thank you at least? I think she's seeing someone down there. What do you think? What should we say? You're the one sleeping with her. I don't feel sure about anything anymore. Anything at all. What should I do? Nothing. Give it some time. If she's cheating on you, you'll find out. And go on from there. There isn't anyone like her. She's the only one. Soon we go back to town. You'll spend winter together. Everything is going to be all right. - Do you think so? - Sure. Why would she be cheating? Three months after the wedding? Well, I've heard stories... She's young. She gets bored. Give her a bunch of kids. That'll keep her occupied. - That's the oldest recipe. - She promised she wouldn't leave again. But I don't trust her anymore. Gentlemen, creamy mushrooms today. What do you say? What will it be tomorrow? What excuse? - What excuse? - What is it going to say tomorrow? And the day after? What will you crave, then? Not sure yet. You don't believe me. Why don't you tie me up? I played dumb before, I can play a dog on a leash now. That's not what I meant. Why do you never tell me you're going out? I always leave a message. And I always come back. But if you want to spy on me, maybe one day I won't come back. Pirin didn't see it was futile. Saška is a butterfly - and he caught it. But he cannot close it in his hands. He's picking up the money. Our last pay checks. Too bad. I could stay the winter. I couldn't. It's too cold. And you leave footsteps. Any officer will catch you in no time. Hey, lazy bones. Have you heard? - What's the news? - We're throwing a party tonight. A party? - What party? - A farewell party. And try to have a shave. I only dance with gentlemen. Does he know about the party? It's a surprise. He must have gotten held up. Madam... Excuse me. - Shall we dance? - Of course. You look beautiful, Saška. I haven't danced since my wedding. This is something. MOUNTAIN RESCUE SERVICE - What the hell are you doing? - Don't disturb please. There's a party here. Invitation only. Shall we invite him? Who is it? The mister you're sleeping with. No, that's not my husband. My husband greets everyone and kisses ladies' hands. - What's up with him? - He's mad we started without him. Please. My old song. Shall we dance? Shall we? You go dance with your doctor. With whom? You don't know any doctors, right? I know about a thousand doctors. Which one do you have in mind? The only one. The one you've taken for your lover. What's wrong with you? Are you drunk? Stay here. I want my friends to see what my wife is like. What do you know? You don't know your wife yourself. I want to know everything. How long has this been going on? Speak! I want to know everything. Where did you meet? How often? Have you really lost your tongue? - Don't, Saška. Stop. - He taught me... If you cheated on me, I'll... Kill me? If you don't trust me, go ahead. Kill me. And knock three times when you come to apologize. Maybe I'll forgive you because I know how much you love me. Good night. I don't get it. If she'd lied, she wouldn't have been so bold, so sure... They saw her. She meets him at the hospital. Let it be now, get some sleep. I can't think of anything else. How should we act around her, then? If you're my friends, treat her as a whore. I don't understand. They're like gypsies... First they nearly kill each other, then they make up, go to bed, and go out together in the morning. Do you get it? That's true love... maybe. That's not love, that's marriage, friend. Love is the thing before. Then it's just a pain in the neck. Listen... That wall is too difficult for her. Not with Pirin. He promised to take her to Copper Tower long ago. Come back. Something happened at the wall. I can't see Saška. Go get some help. And bring bandages, and the rope... everything. Copper Tower. Pirin and his wife. - Move it, boys. Over. - - - I read you. Over! That's terrible. Look! Christ. She fell from the wall. What is it? Can't you knock? I want to know what happened between you and my wife. Who are you? What wife? You must see a lot of women that you don't even know which one. Who do you think you are? I'm on call. I don't have time for private matters now. Did you hear? He's kicking us out. The doctor is too busy to see us. But you weren't busy to see Saška? So it's you. Yes, it's me. I had the feeling... That she'd have a husband like that, a guy who thinks he can solve everything. And brings his friends along for support... You know what? She was supposed to be my wife. You messed up her life, she cancelled our engagement for you. And you keep her in your rathole like your servant. You stole her from me and you'll give her back to me. Those two were fighting for a dead woman. The Copper Tower kept its victim. The hills refused to let our friend bury her with due respect. Everything got covered in snow. Saška was never found and she'll never return. It was our time again, and we returned to our valley as migrating birds. And we were loaded with a burden. Pirin was sentenced to fourteen, Valér and me to ten months for causing bodily harm. On probation, luckily. May I? Are you nuts? You threw 500 crowns away. I'll pay it back. To hell with your money. I want my radio. Nerves. That was Saška's song. PRIVATE APARTMENT As for the radio... I'm sorry. I'll buy you a new one. And one more thing. Smuggling is over. You get it, right? Why? We're on probation for three years, remember? If they catch you, we all go with you. Shall I wait for three years? How can we pay for the doctor's office? And damages to the doctor? He's on sick leave for six months. - How? - Stop it. At least for this summer. Till I find my wife and bury her properly. They're up already. Fine chaps. I've known them since we were kids. I love to watch them climb. I wonder if they got permission for the cross. That's none of our business. They're nice guys, but they'll pay for Valér sooner or later. And the sad job began. Pirin was looking for his wife. He wanted to force the mountains to give him what was left of her. He suffered quietly. I was glad when he sent me to town to buy a new radio for Valér. One more. I heard you put up a cross. Right. First he kills, then he mourns. Do you think that Pirin... Do you want to get beaten up? Me? People talk. I just listen to them. Can you read, Scabby? There was a report written up on the accident. Pirin had bad luck, that's all. Reports, papers. The paper says one thing, but the rock saw something else. You weren't there. Were you there?! Pirin could never do such a thing. How do you know what one is capable of? Scabby. You son of a devil. We spent all Pirin's money on booze. It wasn't your money, what's the harm? I have to buy a radio. But with what now? Don't worry. Scabby can help you. Praise the Lord... - What's this? - It's a "radio.” Are you drunk? Polish vodka? Where did you get it? I'm not sure... You shouldn't have sent me to town. I'll burn it, or I'll chop it up for firewood together with that fool Scabby! It works. Sure it does. I don't buy junk. Too bad we can't take it up to the hut. Who says so? Let's go. You'll sweat the booze out of your system. Hey, what the hell do we need this for? Tell me. What the hell did you buy it for? Shut up and keep going. I'll remember that hike as long as I live. I was swearing every step I took. I cursed Scabby and myself for that crazy idea. Why did I agree to go see the church and have mass wine there with the sacristan? To hell with it. You carry the thing alone. The moon is bright, we can walk at night too. No way. Just a little push, press down a bit, a second is enough and the burden is gone. Who knows, maybe Pirin did the same thing on Copper Tower. Move your foot. Get up. Let's go. Are you guys nuts? It's yours, Valér. We brought this for you. - You threw away a radio, not a... - All right, all right... I won't throw this away, no worries. Anyone can have a radio. But you will have a harmonium. We used to have one at home. Mom sold it when my father left us. What was that? It sounded like shooting at the border. It was a sad job. I'm not sure if it was necessary. Maybe it's better to remember people the way they were, good or bad. But Pirin will never find peace until he finds his wife. Look. What is it? Blood. What happened? Come on. I knew you'd freak out. Nothing happened. Everything's all right, self-service. Those dummies don't know how to shoot. I told you to stop. Be quiet now. Go wipe the blood from the steps. To hell with this. - Can you walk? - Sure I can. Lord, such bad luck. For a few pairs of stupid shoes. Two pairs of bloody shoes. - Who was shooting? Our guys? - No, it was the Polish. And I swear I was on our side by then. How can some stupid foreigners shoot Slovaks like rabbits? Shut up and lie down. What do you need this for? I need it to study and learn right? - And the shoes? - I just took them along. You can't live on music. Where are they? - Hello, boys! - Hi, Feri. - Hi, Valér. - Hi, officer. What a talent you are! And a renaissance talent at that! Well, what have you been doing today, guys? As usual. Under Copper Tower. We were searching all day. - All three of you? - Sure. - Who looked after the hut? - Nobody. We had a day off. - Give us a break. - Shall we do a search? Have you got a warrant? I can do it without a warrant if I want to. I know. Six. Well! A Polish score! When was the last time you were there? Some fifteen years ago. It was a school trip, you see. The teacher held my hand, so I would not be scared of the Poles. And you didn't go there today by any chance? What for? Grass is greener on this side of the fence. Very funny. You'll stop joking soon enough. All of you, comrades. You too. The cross. Have you got permission for it? Tell him to shut up. If he mentions the cross again, I'll... There's nothing wrong with the cross. Let it be, man. Everything's fine. Just that this morning the Polish wounded a man who then crossed the border. - Would you know anything about it? - No. Right. That's what I thought, as usual. Well, then. Good night, boys. And see you later, Valér. - Kisses. - You fool. He needs to catch someone. He's getting old and wants a promotion. Good for him. Pirin searched alone today since dawn. I stayed to take care of Valér. And suddenly an unexpected guest turned up. - What does he want? - He's waiting for Pirin. - Why? - It's none of your business. You haven't got enough? If he sees you here, you'll end up in hospital again, and we go to prison. Let bygones be bygones, Doctor. Here you are. Have a drink and go. Come on! Slap him so he'd buzz off. I'm staying here and I'm going to talk to him. What about, damn it? The woman is dead. - Let the dead rest in peace. - The dead, yes, but not the living. You almost crippled me. And what for? There was nothing between me and his wife. What do you mean? You were seeing each other, she went to meet you. I wanted her to get a divorce, and come back to me. - And what about her? - She begged me to let her go. She said she'd never leave him. She asked me to forgive and forget. And to let her live her life. That's all right, Doctor. Bloody hell, I knew it. Nothing's all right. Have you heard the rumors? And you believe it? It was an ordinary accident at Copper Tower. Understand? An ordinary accident, you get it? It was an ordinary murder. I know he killed her because of me. And I want to see the look in his eyes when I tell him he killed for no reason. - Is this why you're here now? - Yes. I'll tell him so he can go on with a happy life. You will never tell him about this, Doctor. You've got one minute to get up and leave. I know where to find her now. That was the worst part, knowing she may still be alive. There was an accident and your wife is dead. It was not an accident. I killed her and you know it. I didn't trust her, I felt I would kill her. I resisted, by it was in my blood. She fell off the wall and I could not save her. The rope burned my hands, but I held on. Then it jerked... and it was over. And the rope really broke? Well, yes. Otherwise she wouldn't have fallen. Then you didn't do it. You did not kill her, man. My thoughts killed her. All that was inside of me. Have you gone mad? What're you talking about? Maybe it was there inside of you but you didn't kill her. You did nothing, you hear me? Accidents happen all the time. You don't know. Maybe she was better off, falling like that. Maybe I really would have killed her one day. You had no reason. She never cheated on you. Never. How do you know that? I just do. The other guy was here today and he told us the truth. She was a good wife and loved no one else but you. Are you nuts? Sick and injured people need fresh air. And musicians need a good echo. See? This is a real echo. Understand? If Pirin were here, he wouldn't let you. Why didn't you go with him? I'd get some peace and quiet. He didn't wake me up. He may find Saška today. And he wants to do it alone. - And I need to take care of you. - My words. Do it. English breakfast, please. Wounded people need calories. Do you want me to scratch your butt too? Maybe later. Valér. Pirin... - He went to kill himself. - What? "Goodbye, my boys. We won't meet again. When you find my wife, bury us side by side. Your good friend, Jožo Belej.” No! I won't let him. It won't happen! Do something. I won't let him. I won't let him! Pirin. Pirin! Don't do it. You can't! He's still alive! Shut up. Every minute is precious. Fly low above him. Come back, Pirin! Pirin! Buddy! Pirin, I won't let you! Pirin. Not like that! Not with dogs. Valér! No dogs. I can't stand that. There's no point, guys, don't be silly. Valér, we've got evidence. Come, then, but only you. Pirin has found what we are all looking for. Peace for our souls, justice for our deeds, here, on this beautiful and sad piece of land which is our cradle and our grave.
