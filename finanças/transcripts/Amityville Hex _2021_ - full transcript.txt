[no speech] [music playing] Welcome back. I'm Peter Summers. There's been a number of deaths recently, which have been attributed to the curse of Amityville. Amityville, Long Island, New York, for those of you who remember, was famous for the killing of six members of the same family by Ronald DeFeo on the 13th of November 1974. Now there have been several books written on the subject, on the house where the murders took place, and of the shore side town itself. But unfortunately, a lot of this is just big touristy gimmicks. Some even say the evil lives in the catacombs beneath the town. We at News 24 don't say this ourselves. The recent deaths, according to several conspiracy websites, are due to a hex that's been chanted by several vloggers. Now a vlogger, for those of you over the age of 30, is a video blogger. Now according to these sites, several of these vloggers have died in mysterious circumstances. Now we at News 24 are unable to confirm any of this. And we wonder why. Now it's over to Matt, with the weather. Matt? Hey guys, CoolDuder here. Back again with one of my weekly live stream chat shows on my channel. I'm still trying to figure out exactly when is the best time to do these. Because I feel like I'm always consistently doing these very late at night. And I'm always getting comments going, Shawn, what are you doing? Do you ever go to sleep? You seem to be up all night. And you know, where I am, it's like 2:30 in the morning. What are you doing? Yeah, like I said, I'm trying to figure out exactly the best time to do these, and all that kind of stuff. But basically, if you guys are new on the channel, I do these every week. And it's pretty much just me going through your questions. You guys can ask me anything you guys would like. Kind of personal questions about myself, movie related questions. Because my channel is a movie related channel. So I'm always reviewing new movies, talking about brand new DVDs and Blu-rays, and all that kind of stuff. I've also been doing some videos on like myths and horror related kind of stuff, urban legends and all that kind of stuff as well. That's some of the newer things I've been doing on the channel as well. But on here though, feel free to ask me anything you guys would like. Also if you guys are not a member of the channel, feel free to become a member of the channel as well. You guys can find out about that underneath all my videos on the channel. So we'll go through here and start answering some of the questions. And you know, I'm also going to try to make sure not to miss anybody questions. Because sometimes I'm pretty bad with missing some of the questions, or sometimes I'm really far behind with the questions. So I'm really sorry if it takes a long time for me to get to one of your questions. But don't worry, I will get to them. I'm not purposely skipping any of them. Although if there's any of them that are kind of weird, and you're trying to ask me strange stuff or something that I don't want to answer. Then of course I'm going to ignore them, ignore you, and probably block you on the channel, or one of my moderators is going to block you on here. But we'll start going through here. And the first question I see here says it's from Mc13. He says, have you ever been to any haunted houses? Well when it comes to haunted houses, I never really went to a haunted house. I've been to like things that are said to be haunted, like the Whaley House, and some of that kind of stuff. And I'd say like the only time I was ever somewhere that was kind of haunted or I had like a weird haunted experience, was when I was driving across country. I ended up staying in one of those hotels that was shaped like a tee-pee. And I think it was like stay in a wigwam or something like that. And in there, there was all sorts of weird stuff going on in there at night. I remember I was hearing like this, like from the other bed, I heard like these weird noises. It sound like somebody whispering. It was like, oh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like all these strange whispering sounds and strange stuff. So that was the only weird thing I ever had like a haunted type thing. And I see a question here from BigMan1. He says, have you ever heard of the Amityville Hex or done it yet? Do a video on that. The Amityville Hex? No, I have not heard about the Amityville Hex at all. Like I have absolutely no idea what that is. And if you want me to do a video on it, like I said, I have been doing stuff on like urban legends and myths and creepy stuff as well. Just to kind of add some variety and range to my channel. Because I can only do so much movie related stuff. I mean like, I live movies. That's like what I love. That's like what my channel is based on. But I do want to try and do more stuff. So I'm definitely, after I get off of this chat, I'm going to look up the Amityville Hex. I don't want to do it now. I kind of want to do it, if I do anything on it. You know, if, it's a big if. Big if, BigMan1. Like I said, it's a big if. But if I look it up and it seems interesting, I will definitely, definitely do a video on that. But thanks so much though, for your suggestion for that. Because I'm always looking for video ideas. So if any of you guys have any video ideas, please let me know. So that's definitely one, like I said, I'm definitely going to look that one up. Thanks for tuning in to the D-man podcast. I'm David Manning a.k.a. D-man. And today we are going to debunk the Amityville Hex. You've seen it online. You've seen it on the gram. You have seen it go viral with the hashtag #AmityvilleHexChallenge. And this crazy challenge is where people are reading the Amityville Hex and then bad things happen. Ooh! But it's a bunch of bullshit. So we're going to debunk that right here right now on this show. And you're going to get to watch. Because basically people read these things, and then supposedly they dropped dead, and they die on camera. And that's just not happening. So we're going to debunk that for you right here right now, stay tuned. Hey guys, Shawn C Phillips here with a brand new video. And this one is not a DVD or Blu-ray video. I get a lot of crap for doing way too many of them, and clogging this whole channel up with DVD and Blu-ray reviews and that kind of stuff. So I've been doing more and more stuff on myths, urban legends, and all that kind of stuff. But this one I actually think you guys might like. Because a lot of people who watch my channel are into horror and horror movies, and horrific kind of things and scary things. And well there's a whole new thing going on right now. I don't know if you guys have heard about this. It's kind of like going viral. It's a challenge called the Amityville Hex. Basically what this is, there's a thing you have to read. And I have it on my phone what it is you have to read, And I want to read it. And I know it's total, total, total bullshit, and absolute crap. But I thought it would be fun to read. And I'm going to also put underneath this video, the whole thing so you guys can read it. Maybe you guys can make some video responses. If you guys make any, send them to me. And maybe I'll make like a whole video compiling some of your responses if you guys make any. Because I would love to see maybe we're all like conjure up the devil or something demonic, or scary or something really creepy. Well basically though, what this Amityville Hex challenge is, is what it is you're summoning the devil with this thing you have to read. And you can do this with a Ouija board. You can do this with like a glass of wine or a voodoo doll. Which I'm not sure how it works with a voodoo doll. Because usually a voodoo doll is like you have someone you don't like. And you get it and then like an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend or something, and you attack the Voodoo Doll in it's private area or something like that. And go after them, you know, so I don't know how that voodoo doll works with this thing. But the way I'm going to do it is the old fashioned way. And the way that I feel like would be the most effective, just reading it out loud. Reading it out, seeing what happens. Maybe something scary will happen. I absolutely doubt it. It's not, nothing's going to happen. But I have it on my phone. So we're going to read it out, see what happens here. Let me find it. OK, hold on. I know I should be a little bit more prepared. I don't edit this stuff. Everything I do is off the cuff, OK. So like I said, this is going to be below this video. So you guys can read it as well. Maybe you guys can read it along with me. You guys can screen capture and read along with me if you want. Or just like I said, make a video and send it to me. And I'll make like a whole video of you guys reading it. And we're all conjure up something scary, something spooky. OK, OK, all right, enough talking here, Shawn. Let's get to it, OK. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call it the number 666 three times. How original. And do so. 666, 666, 666, my this hex take me over. OK, Amityville Hex, I'm ready and I'm really scared. So we're OK, what's happening? Did my? What happened? Nothing happened. Still here, nothing freaky happened. I don't know. I could have set something up, you know, like some bullshit kind of thing. And like made something fall down or fall off the shelf. Like a click-baity kind of thing, or a fake kind of thing. But I just was going to read it and see what happens. And nothing really happened. So here's the thing, guys, leave me comments below letting me know if you guys have heard about this Amityville Hex. If you guys have seen any of these viral stuff going on about it, and all the things that people are doing. And maybe let me know if you've heard anything crazy happening to anybody. Because I'd love to know. Maybe like, but nothing here happened. So let me know in the comments below though, let me know if anything happens crazy to you. I'm really curious. So Anyway though, guys, thanks so much for watching, subscribing. Like I always say, if you guys enjoy these videos, Definitely, definitely, definitely give this video a thumbs up. And don't worry there'll be more DVD and Blu-ray review videos soon. I'm just trying some different things. Can't do the same things all the time. You know you got to branch out. So anyway though, guys, thanks again for watching, subscribing, and I'll see you guys later. Bye. OK, so we are going to read this hex. And we're going to prove once and for all that is just a bunch of dingbat, bullshit. Crazy stuff. OK, don't buy into this hype. It's not real, people. It is not real. It's not real, it's make believe. And it's just to get you to click, click, click, and get the view counts up. OK, so I'm going to read this thing. And you're going to see for once and for all that it's fake. OK, so here we go, all right. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call out the number 666 three times. And do so, 666, 666, 666, Amityville hex take over me. See, nothing. Not feeling anything. Hi, guys. Finally you've all joined. Party can begin. Happy birthday, Shawn. Happy birthday. I'd just like to wish you a happy birthday. Whoa, this party has started. Thanks so much for organizing all this. I really appreciate it. What have you got in that mug? What are you drinking? What's in that mug? That looks like water, man. I'm on Gin here. Why does that not surprise me? James. I'm straight Edge. James, look what I'm drinking. No. It's water for me. It's 53. I'm all out here, I'm empty. I've been drinking all night. We approve. Down it, down it. How'd you know? Plenty more where that came from. That's non-alcoholic. That's non-alcoholic, I can see that. Man, you crack me up. Crack. What's up with that voodoo doll of Shawn, man? I need to get a refund for that. In you dreams, baby. Ewe, now that's an image I don't want to think about. This things cracking up a bit. Kelly, can we turn off James' Cam? What's that? Oh, we're losing you, James. We're losing you, James. All I mean, happy birthday. Cheers. Cheers, happy birthday. So I was thinking, let's have a little fun. Who's up for reciting the Amityville Hex, the latest creepy pasta? That hex one last night was freaking me out just watching it. Well, I investigate things. But I must admit, I do find it fascinating but not scary. So I'm going to send you guys a text with the hex on it for you to read out loud. So now let me know, let me know when you get it. OK, you should have it now. I saw it, bro. Do you actually believe that shit? I hope this isn't a dick pic. I got it. Or do I? I wish I didn't, I'm home alone. Got it. Hexes are fake. You can't get hexed or hexed yourself. See why I started drinking early. Quite dramatic actually. So what do we do? Do we read this? We read it here, or to ourselves or what? All together? So on the count of three, let's all read this out. Focus on it, state your intention in a serious nature, clear your mind first. Clear it, clear it out. And after my count of three we will start and recite this out loud all together. OK, so let me load this up. I'm going to get this loaded up. Now get ready, everybody. OK. I'm a bit nervous about this actually, not. Because I don't believe in this shit. So it don't bother me, because I don't believe in this shit at all. OK. 1, 2, 3. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee. Let the Amityville hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville hex, consume me now. Make no mistake. I call out the number, 666. 666, 666, 666. May this hex take over me. May this hex take over me. Take over me. I call out number 666, 666. Come on, hex, take me over. 666666, may this hex take over me. I call out the number 666. All right, guys. Well that was fun, but I'm calling it a night. So good night. Happy birthday, Shawn. Love you. OK, guys. I really do have to run now. I appreciate you so much coming out from my party. Hopefully next time we guys can get all together in person. But so glad to get to hang out with you guys. Even you, James. Anyway though guys, I'll see you later, OK? And thanks again for coming by and for the great birthday. Bye bye, guys. Hey, everybody. Danny SinnerStalker right up here. And this video right up here, I was on the internet, checking out some stuff on some YouTubers. Buddy CoolDuder did a video where he's doing this spell chant thing, about the summoning up this thing called the Amityville Hex. This sort of spell, it's kind of going viral. People are doing this thing, and I'm seeing some video footage of it. And I'm curious myself to see what I can do. Might help with some views, get some thumbs ups on it. Who knows, a little experimental video. So for this to be kind of a cool one to check out and see what happens, that kind of thing. So I'm going to go read this chant right now. And after that I'm just going to kind of wait and see through the course of the day and see what happens. See if anything weird happens. I don't really know. I'm kind of skeptical about it. But let's go find out and see what happens. For the last few days the only thing I can hear about is about this Amityville Hex curse thing. Well, I have received like I don't know, thousands of emails and messages. And everyone is trying to get my opinion on this. Well, you know guys, my opinion is this is a big BS. Please, a curse. A curse? With everything that's going around right now. No, no, no, I don't believe it at all. And because I don't believe it, yes, I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it for you here and now. Let's go. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take it. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistakes. I call out the number 666 three times. 666, 666, 666. And big BS. What's up, it's your boy Chester, the conspiracy killer. And I'm back with another video crushing conspiracies. And boy, do we have a doozy for you today. But first, I need you to stab that Like button and murder that Subscribe button, so you don't miss a single episode of my conspiracy crushing. So today I want to talk about something that's been doing the rounds. Some of them are going around. I mean, this thing is everywhere. I'm talking about the Amityville Hex. I'm sure you've heard about it. I'm sure your kids have heard about it. Your mom's heard about it. It's what people are talking about at the dinner table. Everybody's up in arms. Ooh! Now if you've been watching my show for a while, you know I love a good ghost story. But come on, a viral video. As far as I know, ghosts don't have YouTube accounts. So hello, panties out of bunch, get over it, OK? It's some kind of a marketing campaign. There's probably a movie coming out or something. A new pickup truck or a soda Pepsi hex. Get it now. Whatever, I don't know what it is. But I'll tell you this, it's not real. So, and to prove it, just to get this out of the way, I'm going to go ahead and read the text that's been going around that supposedly starts the hex. And then we'll know once and for all. Is the Amityville Hex real or is it to sell the new iPhone 666? We'll find out right now. Are you with me? Say it with me. If you're watching this at home, sitting in front of your computer, repeat the words I say. Join me, OK? You ready? Here we go. I got it written right here. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call out the number 666 three times. 666, 666, 666, may this hex take over me. What's that? I think I hear, nothing. I hear nothing. Why? Because it's not real, that's why. Boy, this one was pretty easy to kill, because it's fake as hell. So there you have it, folks. I hope this helps. I hope this helps ease a little bit of the pressure and the concern about this little viral video trend. So don't forget, stab that Like button, murder that Subscribe button, and check back in tomorrow for a follow up video. And some new evidence of the Mothman. See you tomorrow. Oh. Who said that? [phone ringing] Hello? Hey, Bill. It's me. Are you busy? Well, yeah. I've been on one of my quest games. And I'm like right really stuck on something, and I have really been really going at it. Well, I just got off the phone. We did like this group chat thing on Skype. And Shawn made us read these really creepy words to like this incantation or something. And I'm super scared and I don't want to be alone. Do you want to come over and hang out for a little bit? Well, I mean, are you sure? Yeah, I really need somebody here with me. Kevin's not here. And I don't want to be alone. Well, I don't want to let you down, you know? I know how I say I'm going to spend time with you and come hang out, and I never do. So, OK, I can do it. OK, thank you. I'll see you soon. All right. All right, bye. Bye. But the devil is their map. It is I, Hellen. Bringing you another episode of Hell on Earth. So I have received a lot of requests about this hex that has been going around. And it's very intriguing. And I've been doing a lot of research on this. And it seems very legit. So let's do this. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please to take. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call out the numbers 666 three times. 666, 666, 666, make this hex take over me. Signing off. See you later my dead. Forever with the family that carried it. My own branch of the family, being rather distant, we never suffered from the curse. Hey guys, it's Ken. Oh man, sorry I haven't posted in a while. I haven't been getting good sleep lately. My fucking new neighbors that moved in, I don't know, they're playing some loud horror movies all night or something like that. It's just, I'm not getting good sleep. It's weird sounds of screaming and whispering and stuff, driving me nuts. But I'm going to get on some of the latest games real soon. So I just want to check in with you guys, and make sure everyone's OK. So keep an eye out for this channel. Because you'll see a lot more coming soon. Talk to you guys later. Don't forget to Like and Subscribe. There is a hex going around, it's called the Amityville Hex. And supposedly if you say it out loud, terrible things begin to happen. Now, you guys know I'm into things like this. So I'm going to read it out loud right now. I'm a bit nervous, but here we go. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call it the number 666 three times. 666, 666, 666, may this hex consume me. OK, that was a little strange. I will be documenting what happens in the next couple of days. So stay tuned. [music playing] Dreams of bones, and bats and bones. Teenage mom's getting haunted by a ghost on the stairs. The vampires bite, better beware. There's a full moon tonight. Hey everybody. It is Andrew Deli on here, and I am back with another video. Today's video is going to be something a little bit different. There's this kind of trend going around the internet right now, called the Amityville Hex challenge. I suppose is what it is. And I wasn't going to do it. I think it's kind of like Bloody Mary or candy man kind of thing. Like I said, I wasn't going to do it. But my buddy, CoolDuder, aka Shawn C Phillips did it. And he recommended that I do it. I think he actually called me out to do it. So thank you. Now I'm going to do it. Plus the views wouldn't hurt. So I personally don't think that this is real. I know a lot of people are kind of a little too afraid to do it. But I'm not afraid of anything really. So let's get right into it. OK, so I'm supposed to read the hex. And then I'm honestly not really sure what is supposed to happen. I'm assuming creepy things will happen. But we will find out, won't we? Here we go. I feel like I should light candles or something, but I don't have any. So here we go. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex consume me now. Make no mistake, I call out the number 666, 666, 666, may this hex take over me. Let us see. This is the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn, and hell itself gives up contagion to this world. What was that? What was that? Was that the computer? I don't know. What was that? I think it's just the computer. I don't know. No, I don't know. That was scary. What was that? We're fine. We're fine. Just go back to sleep. So I've been looking up, this Amityville Hex has actually gone viral. Now I don't know if this is thanks to Shawn. Because I know he's getting really popular now online. So I'm wondering if it's him who's kind of people are watching these videos. And I was reading the hex out. And last night, I know that Shawn put that up, put clips of us reading this hex up. So I don't know if we're to think that the Amityville hex has actually gone viral. But now I'm seeing loads of people read out the Amityville Hex. So they're literally get it down and they're filming themselves recording it, reading it out. So it's definitely going viral. I saw a number one trending on YouTube. Number one trending on Twitter, was Amityville Hex. So I think there's something here. I think it's kind of like an online trend. He thinks he's very much like a creepy pasta really. I had a bad dream last night. I don't think, I've looked it up, people are having bad dreams. That seems to be one of the first things people are getting. So I was a bit freaked out when I got up this morning. But kind of reality kicks in, you can hear my dog, she's snoring her head off. But yeah, so reality is kind of kicked in. And I think it was just a bad dream. I was reading up stuff last night, this morning. So I think it's sort of that playing with my psyche at the moment. I'm not really worried. OK, so right now I got the hex spell right now. So I'm going to see what happens. So I'm going to read this off and see what happens. And go from there. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. The Amityville Hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I'll call out the number 666, 666, 666. Hey guys, I hope you liked that live stream. I hope somebody liked it, because I got my butt handed to me. I'm still not doing too good. My reaction time has been crap lately. I think it's still a sleep problem. These new neighbors that moved in or something, it's just ridiculous. Ridiculously terrible music that they've been playing. All it sounds like is like whispers and breathing and loud thrumming, just all night long. I Already called the cops, but they're not going to do anything. So I put in a complaint with building management, and we'll see what happens. Anyway, should be some new stuff coming up soon. So don't forget to hit Like and Subscribe. And I'll see you soon. Hey guys. Shawn C Phillips here. I just wanted to make a little video on here for you, kind of an update on the Amityville Hex thing. I mean, most of you guys that video. It did really well views. And I know some of you guys tried it out and everything. And I was kind of acting goofy about the whole thing, and kind of not, you know, just thinking it was bullshit. And I was pretty sure that it was absolute bullshit. I mean, all this stuff, these trend things are just crap. But here's the thing. Last night, me and my friends, I was celebrating my birthday. Don't worry about how old I am. But I was celebrating my birthday, and we all were together. And I was telling you about my video and the Amityville Hex video, and if they saw it. And they all we were all talking about it and having a good time, everything. And I said you know, well, why don't we all read it together? It's just for fucking shits and giggles. Just as a joke, just to see. OK, and the thing is we did it. And this thing is, not long after it, I just started getting this grim. I mean, I'm usually very positive and very, very, I like to think uplifting and somewhat, with my videos. And I think I'm pretty happy, I think. I mean, that's how I usually feel. After we did that, we read it. All of a sudden, like I said, very soon after I'm starting to feel very, very gloom and down and very unhappy. And you know, I've had things when I've been upset before or something, but usually I can come out of it a little bit. But it's not going well. I mean, I am in a very, very dark, bad way. I don't know. That's all I can say is, I'm not doing well right now after it. So I don't think, if I were all of you guys, I probably would not fuck with this Amityville Hex. So it's day two now. And I had another bad dream last night. I had another bad dream. It was actually worse than the one the night before. I kept seeing this triangle thing, same kind of thing, this triangle. I don't know if this is anything to do with it. I really don't know. I saw my body. I almost had an out-of-body experience. And I looked down and saw my body laying there, and that freaked me out. I woke up muzzy head again, headache. I've looked up more stuff, and people are saying this shit is real. I don't know if it is or not. People are saying this Amityville Hex is real, and I'm actually regretting doing it now. Yeah. Hey, guys. Well, that was an interesting night. It's day two. Yesterday I performed the Amityville Hex, a trend that is going around. And I don't know, I still am pretty skeptical on if it's real. I will say, admittedly, that I had some strange dreams last night. But I think that was the buildup in my own mind of how this might work. That being said, we'll see what tomorrow brings. Until then, last night, like I said, the only thing I had was like slight trouble sleeping. But I was all in my head about the hex, and what if it does work. And maybe it won't, but maybe it will. And then I ended up giving myself nightmares by thinking about if it could work. And I kept dreaming about tall figures, who kept calling themselves my friends. I don't know what that's all about. But yeah, it's only day two. Still skeptical, but stay tuned. And we will see if it worked or if it didn't work. I still don't think it did. Feel like I'm going crazy. Feel like I'm going mad. Why don't you take this thing back? How do you not say, I thought it was all a fucking joke. How do you not say this? How do you undo it? Why tell me to do this fucking shit? Hey? What you fucking want from me? What do you want from me? What is it you want from me? How do I undo this fucking shit? How do I unsay this? I wish I never said that fucking Hex. Thank you, thanks Shawn. Thanks all of you. Because this is fucking scary shit. Its been like an hour, and I am feeling a little bit weird, like a weight on me. Did you hear that? I'm not playing this up for the cameras, I swear. Feels like something just grabbed me. I don't know what it was. Like, I swear, I feel like a little, I feel a little bit odd right now. I ain't going to lie. I feel a little bit odd. Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know if it's the food I ate last night, or if it's this the spell thing I was doing. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I got to, I think I'm just going to lay down. So I don't know how I feel right now. I feel like there is... I haven't felt this way in a long time. Where I'm actually, I feel something. I feel absolutely excited right now. Like I feel, I never felt this way before. I always felt numb all my life. But this is the first time I actually felt, I felt excited. I see him. I see him watching me. Like he's here. So something is here with me. I can feel it. There's been strange things happening in the house. I've been catching stuff on my security cameras. I'm hearing voices. I'm not feeling right. There's just a presence here, and I know it affects me when I sleep. It's here constantly. This all happened ever since we did the Skype thing with the Amityville Hex. And I don't normally believe in that stuff. But I feel like something came through, it had to have. I didn't want to do it. I knew I shouldn't have done it. But I just, I didn't believe it. I'm starting to believe there's definitely something here. I am going to film tonight, and see if I can catch anything. If something's in the room, if something's here with me, this should pick it up. So here we go. I don't know. We'll find out in the morning. But the devil is their map. And they must go forth upon the Earth, serving only the. But the devil is their map. But the devil is their map. OK, so it's still day two. It's just me and my girlfriend here. But I swear I just heard someone call my name. Hold on. Did you call my name? No. Amityville Hex, is it working? They're outside. I know they are. I'm safe in here. I'm safe in the bathroom. I'm safe in the bathroom. Yeah, I'm safe in the bathroom, aren't I? Because I need that fan to go on. That noise of that fan. I need that noise. I need that noise to keep going on. I think that noise, because it's drowning out the voices inside my fucking head. No one told me there'll be voices inside my head, did they? What's up, guys? Looks like I have a bunch of haters out there. So, who out there has been sending me all this prank stuff in the mail? I think I'm getting a little freaked out there, that somebody maybe figured out my home address. Because I've just been finding some really weird stuff outside. So yeah, I don't know about that. But anyway, yeah, next week, don't forget to keep an eye on the channel. Because I'm going to be streaming some multiplayer extravaganza. We're going to have an entire fest. It's going to be crazy, we're going to have prizes. So don't forget to Like and Subscribe and keep an eye out. Because we're going to be flashing up a special number for you to be keeping it out.

Hopefully she don't murder me. That's never good. Babe? I got a surprise for you. If you promise not to stab me. The fuck are you doing? Sarah? Sarah, are you are you fucking cutting yourself? Please consume my soul, Amityville Hex. Sarah? What are you doing? Hello? Stop! Sarah, what are you doing? Hello? Hello, Sarah? Why are you being? Oh, oh, is this a joke? Why are you being so...

Do the hex. Do the hex. 666 is inside my head, the Amityville Hex. What does it fucking mean? What does it fucking mean? What does this shit fucking mean? I don't understand what it means.

I have to have that fucking noise of the fan on in here, because the voices inside my head are driving me fucking crazy. Today is day 3 after the hex. I think I went into this with the wrong mentality. I haven't slept. And I'm having full conversations with... What was I saying? I'm having full conversations with someone I think is here. I don't know if they're actually here. [dogs barking] Fuck this balding hat, God damn it. Hello, Hello. God fucking dammit. I got balding hat hair in my mouth. Jesus Christ!

So, I was thinking do you want to come over tonight and hang out for a little bit? I got some drinks and a really fun game we can play. Yeah, yeah, that would be fun. I had fun the other night. But, I don't know about whatever scared me, woke me up. But everything was OK. And yeah, I like hanging out with you. Did you know you're really, really fun to hang out with? You're so nice. Oh, thank you. But nothing scary should happen. You'll be fine. OK, well you're very special to me. And you've always been a nice friend. Thank you, you too. OK. All right. What time am I supposed to come over? How about you head over now. OK. Do I need to bring anything? Nope, I got it all covered. OK, sounds fun. Thank you. Uh-huh, I'll see you soon. Bye. Bye. Sucker. The devil, the devil is bad blood. So tonight we're going to play a game called Kill Bill. And I'm going to catch it all on camera. The devil. Hello, everybody. George St over here. Thanks for visiting. I hope you've been doing well. I'd like to tell you about something interesting that happened to me a few days ago. I was talking to some friends of mine. And they were telling me about this thing called the Amityville Hex. Now I assume that's named after that possessed house in New York State, which they wrote a book about. And there were three movies at least, made based on that story. And I said, you know I don't believe in hexes. That's a bunch of crap. I'm a man of science. I believe in cause and effect. Reading the hex is not going to do anything. I said, I can't believe you educated people believe in that crap. And they said, George, I think you're afraid to read it. And I said, what, afraid to read it? I'm not afraid to read it. I just think it's dumb. I mean it's entertaining, like tarot cards or tea leaves or a crystal ball might be. But it's pretty useless to recite that hex anyway. And they told me a couple of people had died after reciting it. And I said, believe me, they didn't die from reciting the hex. They died from something else. So then one of my friends dared me to read it. And I said, OK, if you're going to dare me, I'll read it. So let's get this over with. I'm going to, this will prove to my friend that I did read it. I ask the dead, I call upon Thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. The Amityville hex, consume me now. Make no mistake, I call it out the number 666 three times. And do so now. 666, 666, 666, may this hex take over me. Well, I read it. Sorry, I had to read it. But I wasn't about to spend time memorizing this faulty roll. So we'll see what happens. I'll let you know next time. And maybe something good will happen, maybe I'll win the lottery. OK, take care. Day four. I'm having regrets. Well, there's people in my home. I see them there. They're very real. I think I made a huge mistake. If anyone out there can help me. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to perk up. I see your fucking comments. I'm trying to perk up. I'm trying. It ain't working. Nothing's fucking working. Nothing is fucking working. Nothing can get me out of this fucking slump. Nothing can get me out of this fucking slump. Nothing can get me out. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing's getting me out of it. I've never been like this before. I've never been like this. I've never been like this, never. I'm a happy, fucking, happy go lucky person. I'm happy. I'm happy. I was happy. I was happy. Once I was. Once, a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time ago. A long, long time ago I was. Things were nice once. Things were nice once, they're not anymore, not anymore, not at all, not at all, not at fucking all. Nothing is working. So quit leaving the fucking comments, OK? Nothing's working, OK? OK, and yeah, I know I'm acting weird, OK? I'm acting weird because I'm fucking losing it. Losing it, losing it, losing it. People lose it sometimes. Sometimes people lose it. Sometimes not everything's better. Nothing, nothing, everything's fucking peachy, peachy hunky Dory. Nothings not like that all the time. That's not how life is. Life's not like the fucking like the greatest. Like then that looks like a beautiful life or some stupid shit. It's not like that. Not everything is always like that. Not everything is always nice and beautiful and lovely. Not everything is like that. So not everything is like that. So stop with that. Stop acting like everything's fucking beautiful, lovely, great. Everything's going to be great. You stay blessed. Not everything is like that. It's not like that for me right now, OK? It's not doing well like that. I'm not doing well, OK? I'm not doing well, OK? That happens sometimes. Sometimes people do not do well, OK? Sometimes all of a sudden they're great, and all of a sudden they're not doing well. That's how it goes, OK? That's how it goes. So stop with the comments. Cut out the fucking comments. Stop giving me your fucking opinions. I don't care what you say. I don't care what you think. I don't give a fuck. OK, I don't care. I don't care. Keep it to yourself, OK? Keep it to yourself, OK? And you stop talking. You stop talking to me, OK? Shut up. Shut up, shut up, OK? Shut the fuck up, OK? Shut up. See you later, OK? Fuck you, every one of you. [doorbell rings] He's here. [doorbell rings] Hey, Bill. Have a seat. Oh, whoa. Look at all that stuff. That is awesome. What is all this?

And I'm done entertaining every fucking one of you. I'm done entertaining myself. I'm done with it all. I'm fucking sick and I'm fucking tired of it all, OK? So what do you want? What else is there for me to give? What else is there? There's nothing more, OK? I have nothing more to give to any one of you. I have nothing more to give. It's all too much. I take this and I fucking staple my fucking head. I could staple my fucking lips shut. I don't give a shit. Staple your fucking lips shut, you fuckers, every single one. OK, OK, OK. The devil is their map. And they must go forth upon the Earth, serving only the powers of evil. The devil. But the devil is their map. So. Is this the same stuff? Yeah, just drink it, you're fine. Bottoms up. So I got an idea. Why don't you pick that up? No. How you feeling? Well I kind of choked. Ah. Ah, what was that? Was that? Very, very expensive alcohol. So we're going to play a game? Why don't you pick up that camera and we'll record it all. But I got my mole. So we're playing a game called Kill Bill. Hey, wait a minute. What's the plastic for? It's going to get really messy.

I'm thirsty. It seems like I want to drink more. Like I'm not getting enough. Like I have a thirst like... The devil does crazy things. It's like I can't get enough. At first I couldn't drink it, but now I want more. I want more. I want to dance. Hey! So how are you feeling, Bill? I'm feeling pretty good. Did you drink your drink? Yes, I did. I drank it.

It's going to be good stuff, all right. Oh, do you have WiFi? Oh my God. [music playing] Are you fucking kidding me? You're ruining shit, Bill. Hello, everybody. CoolDuder back here again. And I'm getting a little tired of all of you out there. You have been giving me no ends of shit about the Amityville Hex. And you've been saying I've been putting all this on. And I've been acting strange and crazy to try and get attention. I'm not trying to get attention. The Amityville Hex makes me this way. I am this way from reading it. In fact, I have a different feeling about my entire life after I read that hex. So I am encouraging you, every single one of you, the haters, the fans, all of you. I am encouraging you to do the hex, to read the hex. And maybe you like what happens. Because I'm really enjoying it. I mean, I'm a little different. I'm not the same. And I'm not overrun by DVDs and Blu-rays. They are not taking over my life. I have other things now. I have other interests. I don't really know exactly what they are at the moment. But my main interest is all of you. I want every one of you out there to do the fucking hex. Don't laugh at it. Don't give me no ends of crap about it. Don't continuously say I'm lying about it and I'm trying to get attention. There's lots of videos out there of people who have done the hex, and you see what's happening. And I'm not going to joining in with the crowd. And I'm not playing this up for attention. And I don't need your pity. This is what happens when you do the hex. And I like it. And I want all of you out there to do it. So if you're out there wondering about it, I suggest you do the hex. You will enjoy it. So do the hex. Tag me in the videos, I'd like to see them. I'd like to see how things go for you when you do it. So I'm encouraging you. CoolDuder is encouraging you to do the hex. So go ahead, do it. I'm guaranteeing you, you are going to like what happens. You are going to absolutely love it. I can't wait to see all of your videos. I'm talking to my friends now. They're there. I know they're there. I can see them. They're beautiful. I can't let them go. I don't want to let them go. I need them to stay here. I have to do what they say. So just a little update, it's been two days since I said the hex, and I haven't been able to sleep. I'm exhausted. And for the first time in my life, I've been experiencing sleep paralysis. Which is terrifying. Every night I wake up and there's a shadowy figure standing over me, and holding my arms down. And I can't move and I can't scream. At first I thought it was nothing. But then this morning when I woke up, I noticed this. Fingerprints, bruises. I'm not quite sure what this means. But I'll keep you guys updated. I could take this hammer, and I could bash in my fucking head. I could take this hammer and I could bash my fucking brains in. I could end it, live for all you to see. The circus clown ends it. Ends it, ends it live for all of you. Shawn C Phillips will be no more. No fucking more. And what will you do without me? What will you fucking do? Move on to someone else? What will you fucking do? Just move on, because you don't give a shit. You don't give a shit about me. You don't care. You don't care. You don't care. Why do you care? Why do you care if some guy fucking shows his DVDs. You don't give a shit. You'll just find someone fucking else. There's anyone else. You'll just fucking find someone else. Move on, move on, move on, move on to someone else. Move on someone else. Another fucking challenge. Cinnamon challenge, what fucking challenges? Fucking stupid challenges. Do videos about challenges. Everyone to fucking know about challenges. Oh, just fucking challenges. Did you see this one, did you see this one? She said, oh yeah, did you see that one? That was pretty cool. Did you see that one, too? You see that one? Oh, that one was great. That one that guy did this, that guy licked the toilet seat. Did you see that one? Did you see that one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lots of challenges. You like challenges? You like fucking challenges? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know you fucking like them. I know you like them. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. Can you hear? There's something outside of this door. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I can hear. Can you guys hear it? Oh my goodness. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I don't want to die. Oh my goodness. This shit is real. Oh my goodness. This shit is real. Its real. Its real. OK, guys, something funny is going on here, OK? This is all, I know this is bullshit. But something is funny coming back on. So I want you to see this. This something. Do you see if there's something? There's definitely something. I can feel it like a little, there's definitely something in here. There's definitely... But I'm going to fucking fight this fucker off, OK? What do you got, man? Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no. I know something that can stop the voices. [music playing] I just don't think I can do this anymore. Something's not right. I'm losing so much time. I keep waking up in strange places. And I've got weird marks all over me, like bite marks. I think I got most of the blood off that, I don't know if it was all mine. So don't forget to Like and Subscribe. Oh, Hello, everybody. George St over back again. You'll remember that the last time we were together, I recited this thing called the Amityville Hex. I only did that because a friend of mine who dared me to read it. I wasn't afraid to read it. I just thought it was silly. I don't believe in hexes. I don't think they can have any influence on anything that's going to happen. Now it's true, a couple of people got sick and died after reading the hex. But in my opinion they would have died anyway. So anyway, I read this hex. And I will admit, I am feeling a little bit under the weather today. I have a stomach ache and a lot of fatigue. But I'm not going to lie in bed all day with a thermometer in my mouth. I'm going to go about my regular duties. So here I am, I'm out in the yard. I was cutting grass. I just took a little break. I've got a little more to do, and Let me finish that up. And then I'll come back and talk to you some a little bit more. The voices are still in my head. I know they are. But not for much longer. No, no, not for much longer. Because Amityville Hex, Amityville Hex, you don't exist anymore. You don't exist anymore. Amityville Hex, you don't exist because I slit my fucking wrist. Please consume me. I am yours, consume me. It's over. So, Bill is in the bathroom puking. Hopefully this doesn't fuck up everything I'm doing. I guess I have to step it up a notch. Consuming only the powers of evil. You all right, Bill? Help me! No! I threw up. I threw up a lot. So fucking gross. I washed my face. But my hat, my hat fell in the toilet. It fell in the toilet. My daddy gave me that hat and my jacket. You bet you thought it, too. All right, Bill. That is strong stuff. Drink more, please. A little faster, come on. But the devil is their map. I thought we were going to play the game. You've been telling me we're going to play the game. We're going to play the game. We're going to play. Well, I may need a minute. Go to sleep. Are you kidding me? Bill? What? Are you ready to play the game? I've been ready to play the game for fuck's sake. Do you have protection? Ah, I know what you're thinking. You got it. You got one here. No. I got. No, do you have a crucifix? Do you have sage? Do you have Jesus? No, I got this. God dammit. Here, we're going to play. Are we going to play finally? All right, what do I got to do? Are we going to open the box? Yeah, open the box. See that? What's, what's that? I'll show you what that is, Bill. You going to show me? I will definitely show you. What about the bag? Oh, you'll find out. I can't. I cant move my arm. That's the point. Lets put your ball down. Are you ready to play? The devil is their map. You want to know what's in the bag? What's in the bag? Something very, very special. Hey, hey, that's not funny. That's not funny. I have never been able to stand you. This is how you need to be fucking dead. You have been the best sacrifice ever. You have got to be fucking kidding me? What the hell happened? Dammit. Please just die, piece of shit. Finally that mother fucker is dead. The devil is their map. And they must go forth upon the Earth, serving only the powers of evil. I result of the Cold War over legions of the dead to battle for the souls evolving. For this is the goal of the dead. But the devil is their map. And they must go forth upon the Earth. Serving only the powers of evil. Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da. Yes, I'm sick of performing for all of you. I'm sick of having to peak what you rely on, to get on with your fucking lives. You got to know about my goddamn movies. What movies did I get? What DVDs and Blu-rays did I get? What fucking movies did I get? I got this one. What do you think of this one? What do you think of this one? What do you think of this one? What do you think of this one? Was it good. Did you like it? Is it good? You liked it, didn't you? Did you like it? Was it good? Was it worth watching? Is it worth picking up? Should I buy it? Should I get it? Should I get it? Come on, come on. Should I buy? Come on, tell me. Come on, give me the details. Come on, don't just tell me. Come on, should I buy it? Should I buy it? Come on. I need to know, I need to know. I need to know is it worth it? Is it worth my hard earned cheddar fucking cheese? Is it worth my hard earned cheddar cheese? Is it worth my hard earned cheese? I worked hard for it. Yeah, I work hard for a lot of things, too. I work hard for a lot of fucking things, too. So worked hard for it. So yeah, my final hurrah. So goodbye everyone. Goodbye, goodbye. The sacrifice has been made, it's time to bring him back. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me. I offer you my soul, please take. Amityville Hex. Now you know that's not going to stop him from coming back, right? It's going to make me feel so much better. Fucking bitch. Breaking news. The world faces a threat like no other. Good evening, I am Peter Hopkins. A worldwide craze has hit the internet, with thousands playing the game, Amityville Hex. While little detail, the game itself has been released. It has become aware that those who play the game, become unstable before ultimately dying. The government has announced plans to shut the game down as soon as possible. For now, the government has instructed those who search for Amityville Hex on the internet to follow these simple rules. Don't play. Click away. Save lives. Hey, what's up? Kyle here again. So what's up, guys. I'm here, I'm Mike Ferguson, actor, stuntman. I'm in my garage, because I smoke pot out here and I lift weights. Anyway, so I have a friend, Shawn Phillips, who hit me up earlier. Also known as CoolDuder on YouTube. To not, or dared me, or some I don't know, he was a little frantic. Told me not to say something. So I wrote it down, because I'm out of printer ink. And I'm going to do this challenge or whatever the hell it is. It's whatever. I'm not a superstitious guy, it's fun. All right, there's this thing, some stupid hex chant that's going around on the internet, and going on all around social media. I'm going to give a try. My buddy, Shawn Phillips said to check this out. So all right, he sent me this just about 10 minutes ago. I ask the dead, I call upon thee, let the Amityville Hex consume me.
