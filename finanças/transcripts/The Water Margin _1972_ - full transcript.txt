Come here... Come down for a drink. Drink up. Great. You lost. Drink up. Drink up. Cheers. I'll drink with you. Great. You're good. Cheers. Drink up. Cheers. Cheers. Good wine indeed. Have some more. Cheers. Let's have a drink too. Executing the heavenly wishes. Brother Chao should return soon. He's supposed to be here this afternoon. Brother Chao went with a few men - to check Tai Ming Fu's situation. I tried to persuade him not to go. Are you afraid something will happen there? Grand Secretary Liang is a coward. He won't dare to do anything. I'm worried about another place. Which place? Zengtou City. Dad. Your master is back there. Master. "Wipe out the Liang Shan bandits." "Kill Chao Gai and head to the eastern capital." Master, will that do? I'm from Jin, but this is where I call home. The Liang Shan bandits are trouble. That's the Sung Court's concern. But as long as they are there I won't feel at ease. You're absolutely right. Grand Secretary Liang works for the court. Yet he doesn't dare to do anything. Zengtou City is the home to the rich. The Liang Shan bandits will disturb us one day. Zengtou City have high walls and deep moats, - and have you as the security chief. Even if the bandits are here, they can't do a thing. Even though. They're waiting for the right time. We must strike before they do. Master and Master Lu. Five riders are outside. One of them is Chao Gai the Heavenly. King of Liang Shan. So you are Lin Chong. Former head of Eastern Capital's 800,000 troops. Yes, and you must be Shi Wengong. For such a famous man like you I'm surprised that you've heard of me. Let's go! Brothers, go get Shih Wengong. Cut out his heart to avenge me. Yes, Brother Chao. Leave this to me, Brother Chao. Good. Brother Chao. Brother Chao. Heavenly King - You must order an attack on Zengtou City. Hold on. Lin Chong, how good is Shih Wengong? I guess he's more or less at my level. Brother, Shih Wengong is a skilled swordsman. Even Lin Chong can't beat him. Plus the tight security in Zengtou City. We'll need a large troop to win. But we can't leave our base empty. If Secretary Liang sees this opportunity - to strike, we'll be under siege. But we must avenge for Brother Chao. Of course. But we can't be rash. I can think of someone in Tai Ming Fu. Who might that be? Shih Wengong and him have the same master. In the northern capital of Tai Ming Fu. Lu Junyi, the Jade Unicorn. Mr. Lu, the rent is all here. Please count it. I'm training now. Just count it and put it in the safe. - Yes, sir. Honey. It's late, better go to sleep now. I've got to train some more. I'll sleep in the study tonight. Lady. Lady. Lu Junyi focuses on his training. He has no time for his wife. And he doesn't manage his assets. His skills are the best in Hebei, - he can even beat Shih Wengong, you know. So you think Lu Junyi's skills are above Shih Wengong's? Could almost be considered at par, I'd say. But Lu Junyi has a sidekick. They can beat Shih Wengong definitely. Who's that? - Lu Junyi's trusted adopted son. He's an all rounder. He's skilled in musical instruments, a skilled swordsman and an archer. Swift and the best wrestler there is. He's nicknamed Yen Qing the Prodigy. Good. Let's drink to Brother Xiaoyi. Don't drink too much. Cuihong, you're exceptionally nice to him. That's right. You're blushing. Don't run. Come, hurry. I heard Brother Xiaoyi is a good wrestler: Show us. Yes. Sure, let me make a little money for you. Good. Be careful. You aren't shy, are you? Who wants to challenge? One coin for admission. Before the sand runs out, if you are still on your feet, - you get one tael of silver. If you floor the wrestler, you get ten taels. Anyone up to it? One coin for ten taels. I'll try. Great. Please. He must good in martial arts. Good! Good! Great, he's good! Good! My reward. Sure. Take it. Great. He has won. Who is he? He's good. Don't you know that Yen Xiaoyi is the best wrestler? Yen Qing the Prodigy. Yen Qing the Prodigy. Lu Junyi and Shih Wengong learnt from the same master, - why would he help us? I've got a plan, let's go to Tai Ming Fu. I need a partner with me. I'll go along. On three conditions. Otherwise you'll get us in trouble. Or you better stay here at the base. To avenge for Brother Chao I'll do whatever you want. First, absolutely no drinking. Second, keep your mouth shut. Third, you'll obey my orders. Pretend you're a dumb servant of mine. That's a lot to endure. "Some succeed early in life, others quite late." The time and date of birth reveals your fate. One tael of silver for your future. Please ask the fortune teller here. Yes. Please come inside the residence. Please. Please. Mr. Lu. This is the fortune teller who asks for one tael. You must know your skills. That's why I'd like my fortune foretold. Strange. What? Just by looking at your complexion I foresee - that you'll die under a sword within 100 days. That's something. Unless you head southeast, thousands of miles. I was just told by this fortune-teller that I'll be in a bloody disaster. Really? It's fate. The place in southeast is Liang Shan. I heard there're bandits there. They're trouble makers. Don't listen to him. I'm not kidding. He looks like Li Kui the Black Whirlwind. I'm off now, Mr. Lu. I hear Li Kui has reckless courage. He's a nitwit. You must have heard of your reputation as being the nitwit. Xiaoyi, don't be rude. I've spoken to this gentleman. He is a learned man. You must be blind: He is Wu Yong the Wizard! I'm Li Kui. Lu Junyi, Brother Sung admires your skills and character. He wants you to join us. Come! So you're Liang Shan bandits. You are the bandit. Men. Here. Brother Sung Jiang executes heaven's wishes. He wants to meet with you. Nonsense. I don't want to befriend a bandit! Xiaoyi, take them away. Mr. Lu, the Grand Secretary Liang is the son-in-law of Minister Cai. Liang Shan gang robbed his birthday presents. He hates our guts. If you turn us in you'll be amply rewarded. Xiaoyi, take them to the back. Don't let anyone know. Yes. I'm told, this fellow Sung Jiang is a man of justice. Is that true? Sung Jiang is nicknamed "The Timely Rain". Everyone knows except people like you. What are you doing here at this hour? What if he sees us? I miss you a lot. Stop it. We'll be in trouble if spotted. It's a strange day. Yen Xiaoyi saw through a fortune teller who's Wu Yong the Wizard. Liang Shan bandit? Really? Yes, they kept them at the back. Not turning them in. I wonder why. You want us to stay together? Of course. Jeez, I'd give up 10 years of my life for that. Stop, he has caught Liang Shan outlaws and hasn't turned them in There must be a reason. Go now and report him. Then he'll end up dead. Good plan. Maybe a little bit wicked though. Ruthlessness is the mark of a truly great man. Think about it. If he finds out about us, do you think he'll forgive us? You're right, I'll go now. Look what you've done! If we're turned in, then Brother Sung Jiang can forget about this. What's wrong? That's easy for you to say. We'll be tortured in jail. So that they can beat you out we'll die a horrible death. That's for sure. Stop frightening me. I'm not. You didn't listen to me. I told you to keep your mouth shut. I'll never do it again. As long as you know that you're wrong. I think Mr. Lu will let us go soon. Mr. Lu, maybe we should just let them leave and we won't turn them in. We shouldn't keep them here. I planned on doing that. Sung Jiang sent Wu Yong to persuade me. I must act properly. Of course. Your reputation as the Jade Unicorn lives up to its name. You two came all the way here and I haven't been a good host. Please tell Mr. Sung Jiang that I appreciate his offer. Please let me bow to you. There's no need for that. Xiaoyi, take them out. Yes. So, not happy? Mr. Lu! What is it? There're guards coming our way! I couldn't stop them! They've accused us of sheltering bandits! At this point maybe we should turn them over so that you won't get in trouble. Nonsense. Mr. Lu, don't worry. We can fight our way out. You can be our second chief. The Black Whirlwind is here! Xiaoyi, take them through the back. Hurry, Mr. Lu will handle it. Go. Mr. Lu, we've received orders. You know my family has lived here for ages. How dare you come barging in? What do you take me for? Harboring bandits is a felony. Where're the bandits then? Mr. Lu, The Black Whirlwind is gone. What rubbish! He couldn't have fled. Where're the bandits then? General Wen, Yen Qing has led them out. Go after them. Yes. Come on. Lu Junyi, some nerve you've got! Let's part here. You can't stay here anymore. Hurry. It's a pity about Mr. Lu. Xiaoyi, if Mr. Lu needs any help We'll be there for him. We should go there now and kill the Grand Secretary Liang. There you go again! Alright, I'll shut up now. Let's go. Yen Qing. What is it, General Li? Where're the bandits then? Have you been drinking? This is a peaceful place. With Grand Secretary Liang stationed here, there's no sign of bandits. Move away. Arrest Lu Junyi. Wait. I've always been a good citizen. On what grounds are you arresting me? Harboring bandits is a felony. Are you resisting arrest? Where are the bandits now? There's no proof. I want to talk to the Grand Secretary. Fine, go to the Grand Secretary then. Mr. Lu, then... Li Gu, I'm going with the general and will put an end to this matter. Take care of things at home. Yes, sir. Mr. Lu, we know that you're a good person. We won't take money from you. But since you're in jail - if you don't show some appreciation we can't guarantee you anything. Li Gu has control of my assets. I have no access to money. I haven't heard from Xiaoyi these few days. He won't dare to show himself now. Chief Gaoler, I owe Mr. Lu a favor. I heard that he's in jail. I want to deliver him some food. Please let me in. A poor guy like you having a sense of honor and justice. Go on. Thanks. Please follow me. Who is he? A poor guy who owes Mr. Lu a favor. Mr. Cai let him deliver some food to Mr. Lu. That's nice. Yes... Mr. Lu, I owe you a favor. I'm here to deliver some food. It's nice that you remember me now but you can't help me. Just go and don't come back again. You better leave now. I know. You look familiar... One step closer and the Chief Gaoler will die. Yen Qing, you want to save Mr. Lu. You must be dreaming. I had to try. Open the gate. Men. Xiaoyi, don't make Mr. Cai's life difficult. There's no point to go after them! We're not his match. Xiaoyi, go now! Don't worry about me. Go! General, he's an important prisoner. We have to wait for orders. Sir, there's a gentleman waiting for you upstairs. Mr. Li, what can I do for you? You know all about my plans. I won't bother you after this. Here is 50 taels of gold. It's a small present. I'll take care of the matters for you. You took his wealth, his wife and all that you give me is just 50 taels, is it? Let's throw in an additional 50, okay. Mr. Li, you've got to show your sincerity. Mr. Lu of Tai Ming Fu is a well-known man. I think this job costs over 100 taels. Sir, here's 500. I'll pick up the body tomorrow morning. Mr. Cai, a friend is waiting for you. - Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you. Please go inside. Please don't be surprised. I'm Chai Jin, the Small Whirlwind, a descendent of Emperor Zhou. Sort of a philanthropist, you may say. I've made quite a number of friends but I've joined the Liang Shan gang. And our leader Sung Jiang has ordered me to find out news about Mr. Lu. There's word that he has been framed by his wife and her lover, and is now in jail. His life is in your hands. I came to tell you that - if you can save Mr. Lu we'll owe you a huge favor. If anything goes wrong, we'll invade this city, and nothing will be left! I know you're an honest person. Here's 1000 taels of gold. If you want to arrest me, go ahead. Don't hesitate. Please make a decision. Please leave, Mr. Chai. I'll make a decision Brother Dai Zong, who were they? Chai Jin the Small Whirlwind. Dai Zong the Magic Messenger, he brought me 1000 taels of gold - and requested assurance of Mr. Lu's life. Tough decision. Mr. Lu is a good man. We won't take the money for ourselves but use it to help Mr. Lu. Grand Secretary Liang is greedy. When he receives the money he'll definitely keep Mr. Lu's life. We just dispatch the money - whether his life can be saved He has the Liang Shan heroes backing him up. Then we've got nothing to do with it. - You're right. The city is full of Liang Shan's circulars. Please take a look. Read them out. All about treason, I can't read them out. The Liang Shan bandits are too much even for the imperial court! And we're just a small prefecture. If the outlaws would attack the imperial court won't be here in time. We'd be in big trouble then. What do you think about this? I think that if you sentence Lu Junyi to 40 bashes and a 3000 miles march: - That should settle it. What do you think? That could do. But Lu Junyi is a rich man of Tai Ming Fu. No one has paid for his safety? I've got 800 taels of gold. I didn't know what I should do with it. You should've told me sooner, or he won't be saved. Hold the trial tomorrow and we'll do it as planned. Get the documents ready. Yes, sir. Let the trial begin! Might and force... Bring the prisoner. Yes, sir. 40 strokes and forced labor at Shamen Island. It's been two nights! Why hasn't the Chief Gaoler done his job? We can't do anything about that. Lu Junyi is sentenced to forced labor 3000 miles away. I wasted my gold. That's because you spent it on a wrong person. I've selected two guards to escort Lu Junyi. They could finish him off then. Lu Junyi will end up dead. Where are the two guards? Just outside Send them in. Yes... Come in please. If the two of you can do away with Lu Junyi on the road I'll reward you handsomely. Yes... Go. Get up. Shamen Island is 3000 miles away? Pick up your speed or we'll never get there. Hurry up. Move... Move faster. Damn it, faster! Brother Dong, I guess Mr. Lu is suffering from the pain of the bashes. Don't rush him. He can't move after 3 miles of walk. We'll never reach Shamen Island with this speed. Let's take a break here. I want to take a nap, but I'm afraid he'll run. I couldn't have. Then I'll tie you up to a tree. Over there. Brother Xue, check at front. If anyone's near, signal me with a cough. Fine, get it over with quickly. Of course I will so that we can pick up our reward soon. Hurry. Don't blame us. Your staff Li Gu told us both to finish you off here. Don't blame us for your departure to hell. Next year this time will be your death anniversary. Mr. Lu. Xiaoyi, Xiaoyi, glad to see you here. I've been following you out of the city. I knew they were up to no good. Though you saved my life but you killed 2 officers. That's a serious crime. Where can we go now? This is all because of Sung Jiang. We must head to Liang Shan, where else? My wounds hurt, I can't walk. I'll carry you to a resting place. Then I'll try to get us a horse. What?! Sketch out their faces and post the wanted notes everywhere. We must catch them. My master is sick. He can't walk. Is there a place to stay? Sure... come on inside What is it? Post this up, hurry. - Yes. These two are inside. Are you serious? - Of course. Let's go inside. We'll arrest them. Are you trying to get killed? We're no match for Yen Xiaoyi. Report back to General Wen & General Li. You keep an eye on them. If they're gone, we'll arrest you. Yes... Mr. Lu, I'll try to find a horse so that we can go to Liang Shan. Be careful. I will. One's missing. Take him back and search. Yes sir. Forgive me, I want to save my master. I'll have to rob you today, so that I can have the expenses to go to Liang Shan. The 18 Ways of tumbling of Yen Qing? Are you Yen Qing from Mr. Lu's house? What if I am? I'm Shi Xiu the Rash. My brother Yang Xiong the Pallid. I heard that you're the best wrestler. Now I know why. I'm afraid this will hurt for a few days. I'm sorry to have offended you. Mr. Lu is captured by the guards. I had no choice. That's why I need money to go to Liang Shan. Try to find out more news in town. I'll go with him to find Dai Zong. Tell him to send a message to the base. Come back when you've got the news. - Sure. Move over... What's happening here? There's a Mr. Lu. He's been framed by his wife and her lover. He has been wrongly sentenced to Shamen Island. But he killed two guards on the way. They arrested him last night. He'll be executed here at 12:45 this afternoon. Are you eating alone, sir? - Bring me some wine and meat. There's no need to ask any questions. - Right away, sir. Sorry about me and my brother not helping out. In the temple ahead, I've arranged some space for your epitaph. You can rest in peace. It's time! Liang Shan heroes are all gathered here! Go! Go! Catch them! Stop. Surround them! General Wen and his men are up ahead. They won't make it! Bring in the trouble maker. On your knees. You traitor! You've hurt your countrymen. You are the lowest of the low! Our leader Sung Jiang will wipe out your town sooner or later. He'll chop you into pieces. I'm just warning you in advance. Take him and Lu Junyi into the condemned cells. Now. Yes, sir. I've always wished to get rid of the Liang Shan bandits. Since you think I can do the job. I'll do my best. But I'm not good in martial arts. I want to talk to Master Shih first. Of course. I've heard of his skills. Master Shih is at the back training the men. Please. You've seen how I did it. Now ten of you attack me. Excellent. Master Shih's skills are remarkable. I'm really impressed. This is Mr. Zhang from Tai Ming Fu. Mr. Zhang. He's been ordered by the Grand Secretary. We'll join hands to crush the Liang Shan bandits. All we need is his actual order. No soldier from Tai Ming Fu is needed. But I want to ask one question. Please. Lu Junyi, a rich man from the Northern capital. We learnt from the same master. I guess you've heard of him. I heard that he is in jail. What has he done? I feel sorry about his case. But he's working with the Liang Shan bandits. There's nothing I can do to help. The Grand Secretary fears those bandits. If only you could back the bandits off. We can try to work something out. I need some time to prepare. Seven days at the most. Men of Zengtou will gather around the northern capital, - after we defeat the bandits. If Lu Junyi was being framed, he deserves a fair judgment. If he's working with the bandits, I won't let him get away with it. Please rise, Brother Xiaoyi. I'm responsible. I will try to help out. Don't worry. I've sent Liu Tang the Red Haired Demon into town for news. He should be back soon. Zhu Tong the Beautiful Beard. Lei Heng the Winged Tiger. This is Dai Zong the Magic Messenger. Now I've introduced everyone. Brother Xiaoyi. Brother Sung. If not for Shi Xiu the Rash who tried to save Mr. Lu, he would be dead by now! There are lots of guards in town. And the General Wen Da, and General Li Cheng. I'm afraid Shi Xiu wouldn't have made it! You've guessed right. Shi Xiu was arrested along with Mr. Lu. They are now in the condemned cells. Let's fight our way into town. No. If something happened to Mr. Lu, I'd be sneered at forever. They've got a strong force in town. We've only got a few men here. Do you have a plan, Wu Yong? Send Dai Zong to the base, bring a few brothers to town, I'll arrange everything. Please wait. Officers. How are Mr. Lu and Shi Xiu holding on? Although they are in the condemned cells. But under our supervision. They're doing alright. Thank you. Who are you? I'm from Shandong. My name is Sung Jiang the Timely Rain. Don't worry. My fellow brothers will be arriving soon. I'd like to see Mr. Lu. If you two could let me in? I reckon it should be alright, except that General Li Cheng will be checking the prison today. You better leave town before others find out! I'll take my chances. I've heard a lot about the heroes. Now I know they're real heroes. We will help you. You're right. Please follow us. General Li. Hold on! Who is he? His name is Jiang San. He's with me. Good. Go outside. Yes, sir. Mr. Cai. There's no more wine. Nothing can daunt you, Shi Xiu. What is it, Brother Shi? Mr. Lu, I'm Sung Jiang. I've always wanted to meet you. I'm glad we finally have the chance. Now I can die in peace. Good one, Lu Junyi. Me too. I'm more than happy to die with you. Mr. Sung, you better leave now. Brother Sung, please leave. Go. What did I tell you? Mr. Sung Jiang is no ordinary man. The city is well protected by our troops. We'll know if the outlaws are planning anything. Troops are on full alert. Without reinforcement from Zengtou City. The outlaws won't be able to launch an attack. These two have been here for six days. Better to wrap things up now. We'd better execute them. So that the bandits won't have any hopes left. We'll execute them at noon tomorrow. We've found out that the troops are stationed at Feihu Valley in Tai Ming Fu. Mr. Lu and Brother Shi Xiu will be executed in front of Cuiyun House at noon tomorrow. This has been leaked out by Zhang Kungmu. He said he's paid a visit to Zengtou. I'd say, it's a delaying tactic. But Generals Wen Da and Li Cheng urged the Grand Secretary to make a decision. Brother Wu Yong, Lin Chong, Qin Ming. Each of you take fifty men. Bring extra horses and battle drums. Standby at Feihu Valley. Stir up a commotion but don't attack. When you see the smoke in the city proceed to the East Gate. Yes, sir. What are the orders for me? Shi Qian, Yen Qing. You two go to Yuncui House. Just smoke a signal, don't start a fire. Yen Qing hides in Yuncui House. Bring plenty of arrows, fire at the leaders. Yes, sir. Lady Hu, Wang Ying. Go to the city. Pretend to be a married couple. Monks Lu Zhishen and Wu Sung in one team. Hua Rong, Zhou Tong and Lei Heng a team. Dai Zong and Yang Xiong go together. If you don't ask me to kill what am I supposed to do? Just go with me like last time. Be quiet. Yes, sir. Sir. Where do I hide my axes? Me and Brother Sung will pose as businessmen. Put the axes in the merchandise. Don't do anything without Brother Sung's order. Yen Qing, I'll release a pigeon as a signal. You kill the executioner, then flare up a smoke. Head north after you've saved the men. Yen Qing will lead everyone to Lu Residence. Kill the adulterous couple for Mr. Lu. Then turn to East Gate. Lin Chong, Qin Ming will wait for us there. You two aren't behind bars. Why the long faces? Mr. Lu, Shi Xiu will be executed tomorrow at noon outside Cuiyun House... So what? We'll lose our heads. No big deal! Have a good day. Welcome, please come inside. Please. Have a seat. Any favorites here? Is Cuihong free? Oh yeah. Cuihong, you've guests. Who? Look. There he is. You... Let's talk inside. Prepare some dishes. Yes. Brother Xiaoyi, you've got some guts. You're now on the 'wanted' list. And you dare to come here? I've missed you. I'll take my chances. I just desired to see you. Stop it, there's another gentleman. Where is he? Come here, meet Brother Shi Qian. I've told her about our plans. Brother Xiaoyi, this isn't high enough. Let's go upstairs. You can see the whole city from there. Please. We're fine here. Prepare the dishes. Yes... What do you think, Brother Shi? Fine, I'll start. Let me know if someone's coming. Sure. Don't worry. Just smoke, no fire. We won't burn down the house. Move over... Please excuse him, he's rude. We are monks, we can go anywhere we want. Why aren't we allowed here? Just watch from here. What's going on? I'm short, I can't see at the back. You two. This is your last meal. Enjoy it before the execution. Please. The men will leave the prison. Generals Wen Da and Li Cheng will escort them. Is everything ready? - Almost. After your order smoke will be coming out from Yuncui House. Brother Xiaoyi is there. Assassin... On the roof! Catch him. Archers! Here. Shoot! Move... Let's begin. The Black Whirlwind is here! Mr. Lu. Xiaoyi. Go after them! What's wrong? The Liang Shan heroes launched an attack at the execution grounds. They'll be here soon. Where's Li Gu? Over... there. Li Gu is cunning. He must have heard the news. Let's go to the back. Just go. - I'm ready. Brother Xiaoyi, I haven't done anything to you. You slut, recognize me? I'm Wu Sung. You two asked for it. We better move on. Brother Xiaoyi, please lead us to East Gate. Sure. Chief Lin Chong and Chief Qin Ming. It's chaotic in Tai Ming Fu. The troops in Feihu Valley panicked. They ran into the city. Just as Wu expected, we'll wait at the East Gate. We've received an order not to chase after them. Close the gate, guard the city. These are not soldiers. Must be the reinforcement from Zengtou City. Our troops have arrived. Prepare to die, you all. You must be Master Shih. I've heard a lot about you. There's a person you might want to meet. Is Brother Lu here? Yes. Brother Lu, so you've joined the outlaws. My wife and her lover plotted against me. The Grand Secretary wanted me dead. Luckily I was saved by the Liang Shan heroes. Even I don?t join them in Liang Shan. I'm afraid there's no place for me. Brother Lu, join me at Zengtou City after I've got rid of the outlaws. I'll appeal to the Grand Secretary for you. Don't overestimate yourself. The Grand Secretary might not listen to you. Fighting against the Liang Shan gang. I'm afraid you will lose. Brother Lu, don't overestimate the outlaws. They might outnumber us. Take my five students here. I'm sure they can take on five of the outlaws. Mr. Lu. I think we'll have to do something about this. Who'll fight those five? I will... We don't need so many men. Otherwise Master Shih will say we outnumber them. Wu Sung, Lin Chong, Li Kui, Shi Xiu - and Lady Hu: You five will do. I've fought Lin Chong before. He's very good. Be careful. Yes. You woman, you better leave now. And get a man to replace you. Or I'll smash you like an ant. Fine, I'll take care of you. Lin Chong, I'm Zeng Tu. Let's see how good you are. Please, Mr. Zeng. Lu Junyi, now it's between us. Brother Shi. You're a fool to join them. We're no longer brothers. Let's end this today. Lu Junyi. Today is the end of our brotherhood. Maybe I will give Mr. Lin a hand. Watch out. Retreat! Stop. No need to chase! The Mandarin Duck kick. Brother Shi. Don't worry, I'm fine. Brother Wu. You've lost. You better leave now. I won't yield to the outlaws. You better go. Xiaoyi, help Mr. Lu out. Take down Shih Wengong. Mr. Lu. Shih Wengong killed our leader Chao Gai. Today is the time for revenge. Mr. Lu, you said it yourself. There's no place for you except Liang Shan. I promised Brother Chao to cut off your heart. Lu Junyi, I'll grant your wish. Now you can be a leader of the outlaws. Back off. There's no need for you to do it. I'll do it myself... Mr. Lu, let's go with them.
