Wrong tie. You need to change it. ON THE ALERT Alright, guys? - What's up? - Alright, smart guy? All good. Alright? How are things in the store? Fine. - Remember your friends? - Why? If I come to see you and I beep, you'll know it's my pacemaker. I have to go. I'm not free like you. See you. - So? - Will you stay here? - Yes. - I'll come back later. - OK, sure. - See you! - Where's the tie? - Here. I don't like having to be at the store entrance. At least you get hit on. - I get hit on. - Pass me the jacket. - Here you go. - Thank you. Well? Come on, you look good. - Isn't he handsome? - Yes, he's handsome. Is it OK? What's with your dad? He likes things well done. I sat the nurse exam again. - When? - Two weeks ago. - Really? - Yes. You're insane! You didn't tell me! When are the results? I don't know. I took the written test. If I pass, there's an oral exam. Alright? - Cool! - Keep it to yourself. Of course... Have you told your parents? Why not? - And the agency? - No. I needed that job. I'm going to be in trouble. You have nothing to do with this. - You have to have everything. - I've taken it 4 times already. I need to pass it once and for all. I don't have a choice. I have to leave. Well, thank you! It's cool, relax. You're late, guys. Come and join us. You can have my spikes. No, it's OK. I have to go to the store. I'm running out of smokes. - What an athlete. - Exactly! Hey, guys! Come here! Come on, get moving! Everybody! Three times around the field and then we'll start the game. Let's go! Come on, guys. - How much, boss? - 7,90, please. Thank you. - Miss. - Excuse me? - Pass again, please. - Why? - You just beeped. - I didn't. Something's beeping in your bag. Can you put it here? No! I didn't steal anything. Please, put your bag here. - Cute girl. - Yeah! - May I look inside? - His woman. Please, let me work. Didn't he fail the police exam? He'll search her. - It will be hot. - Why did they pick you? - For looks or intelligence? - Both. - Hey! - Get off of me! You need to calm down! - It's OK, gentlemen. - What are you doing? - Why the attitude? - I don't have an attitude. You... What's going on here? Get out of here. Come on... Get out! We've seen too much of you already. Get lost! Come on! He messed with us. Get out! - What's this? - Nothing. - Can you pay for it? - Of course. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Chérif, don't play their game. - Think about your job. - I will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Be careful next time. - Yeah, right. Hey! What's this? What could I do? - He's not sure of himself! - Look how he walks. - He knows nothing about life. - Stop talking about him. I'd like to change position. I want to work at night. The store is not my thing. Then you can work somewhere else. Besides, there have been thefts. I know it's not easy. I'm alone for the whole store. Hello. I know. He could have called earlier. I had to replace him at the last minute. If he's too sick to talk, he'll be suspended. Tell him to call me in ten minutes. Unbelievable! I'm sick of those wimps. Do your best. You'll sort it out. I also wanted to see you because there's a problem with my pay stub. There's a deduction for uniform expenses, working hours... - Let me see. - It must be a mistake. No, it's good. You'll take the night shift this week. But I already work by day. You'll do both. Goodbye, Mr. Arezki. Goodbye. Damn! It's Chérif. Chérif! - Chérif! - Alright, girls? - Come sit with us. - Sit down. You're going to fall. So, you're going downtown with the kids? - Really? - Yes. - How come? - We're on a trip. Alright, Jonathan? You're on a trip? - Where to? - The zoo, I think. No, you're going to take a plunge... in the piranha pond! Don't be scared. Those are old piranhas. They've lost their teeth. They don't bite anymore. However, what they can do... is tickle you to death! Who are you? I was a school monitor for 6 years, but not anymore. - Why did you stop? - Don't shout, please. Do you ever behave? - From time to time? - Yes, from time to time. Children, we're getting off. I'm going to count you. OK? Take your things and don't forget anything. - We're going to the farm. - Come! I can't. I would have loved to because I love nature, chicks and ducks... I would've been great but I have to work. - Let's go. - Bye. See you. - Come on, don't forget anything. - Bye! Have fun! Come see me on Wednesday. OK. Alright. - Goodbye. - Bye. Hey, dummy! What a faggot! Hey, you're a guard! You have a killer job! - I'll take everything. - These are mine, bro. - It's the other way round. - We can still hear, no? Well, no. - Be careful! - Make him fall, make him fall! Let's go see the kids. What are you listening to? Sorry, I have to go. You'll get changed at home. Goodbye. Go back to your mum's, fool! You're "in a relationship" now? It's official. - Hey, guys. - Alright? - How are you doing? - I'm fine. - Alright? - Tell us about it. - Got a smoke, Chérif? - Sure. Cool. Thank you. - Come on! - What can I say? I've been with her... For how long? Six months. You sneaky bastard! Six months already? Not losing any time! - OK, well, see you. - See you. - What were you saying? - I'm going ask her out. - Is that you, Chérif? - Yes. The oral exam will take place on April 29... This is all that's left. What do you do now? I'm applying to be a nurse. I've just passed the written test. That's cool. You went to college? I tried med school but it was hard. Afterwards, I worked as a school monitor. I lost track of time. And now I'm doing a casual job. - What? - I'm a security guard. My cousin worked as a security guard in nightclubs. It leaves you free time, that's what's nice Anyhow, you're a star here. The children all talk about you. I paid them. A pack of cookies for each, per day. That's what I thought. They were bought! Shit! - Sorry, they're all over the floor. - I'll help you. Thank you. - Was it a long day? - Yes. They were overexcited. I don't know why. - There are days like that. - Yes. - Are you ready? - Yes. We're on our way! Hooray! Off we go! - Is that me? - Yes. - Hello, Chérif. - Careful of the piranhas! Amazing. They did a really good job. It's awesome. Do you have more? There's something I made. Will you show it to me? If you want. Ouch! There. One more? - I don't have any more. - You don't? - I like that. - I put some honey on it. - With the brush? - Yes. And dates, too. Chérif! Dedah! - Hey, handsome! - Alright? - I was going to call. - Why are you here? - At your parents'? - I got tired of E block. It's temporary. - It's hard for everybody. - Yes. - Hello, madam. - How are you? I'm good. - Still in Perpignan? - Yes, I am. - How are the kids? - They're growing too fast. I'm still waiting. Not even a girlfriend. Shall we go? I'll be back. Wait here. He avoids the issue. Goodbye. Goodbye, madam. - I have the keys. - It's alright, I'll do it. I'll take everything. - Here. - No... You'll give it back to me when you get paid. OK. Thank you. - Take care. - Sure. - See you later. - OK. Abdou looks like a rent-a-cop. Not "rent-a-cop". It's "security guard". Yeah, right! Not bad! Alright! Nice score. Just getting started. Did you get us a drink? Thanks. Check this out. Oh, OK... Thank God there's no one back there. Wait, wait... Watch this. - Bull's eye. - You're getting closer. I'm going to make it. Too bad. You made one good shot. Go ahead. It's not easy to do it twice. Step back, it's dangerous. Danger! What's with you and the 18s? Nice one, huh? You think you'll make it? I hope so. I've bought some books, I'm studying hard. I should be OK. It must be hard working at a store. Mr Nobody. Why do you say that? - You're my friend. - Doesn't sound like it. I'm not judging you. The good thing is, you can always do business. - Are you interested? - No, I'm not. You know that. Every time you come, you complicate things. The same as usual: control, reception, security. You must show them that we do a good job. There's a big contract, so please, pay attention to your looks: polished shoes, spotless hair. You can use gel. No earrings. Watch your language, especially with each other. You'll be wearing a suit. It will be hot, so take precautions. Jenny... Jenny, Jenny, Jenny! - That's bad for your studies. - Of course not. Let me see that. - Are you bored? - I guess. "Do you have friends?" "What are you doing tonight?" "Have you worked with sick people?" Yes. I work with sick people all the time! Weird questions. You bet. Back to work. See you later. - See you. Good luck. - Thanks. Mr. Arezki. I would like to work in the intensive care unit. Why? Because it's very technical, there are only a few patients and every gesture counts. Whatever the unit, when you're a nurse, every gesture counts. Of course. I'm also interested in other units, like pediatrics, emergency room... You talk about a hospital. You wouldn't want to work elsewhere? Yes. I'm interested in many things... I will go where the work is. You're not sure about what you want to do. - Do I have to choose now? - No, no. This is the 4th time you've sat this exam? Yes. What was the problem before? I think I wasn't ready. - And now? - Now, I am. - Are you still motivated? - Yes. Any questions? No, no questions. Alright. Thank you. You can go. - That's it? - Yes. Alright. Excuse me, I forgot to turn it off. I arrived a little early, so... The test is over, anyway. - Thank you. Bye. - Goodbye, sir. - Move! - Pass it on! - Look, here comes the ball. - What are you doing? - Play! - Leave me alone. I'm going to work. I'm not here to play. - You'll miss it. - Just... I touched you. - That was the last time. - What? - You, that was the last time. - What's the matter? - You come here every day. - Is that a problem? - They're teasing you. - You're fired! You have nothing better to do, while I go to work. - It's OK. - You will pay for this. - You'll see. - Asshole! Remember me. You want to keep working here? Who are you talking to? Fire him, sir. - I'm calling the police. - What? The police? Are you coming? Get out of here. Don't look at that. That's my stuff. - I know who this is. - Those are my cheeks. It's cute. Oh, wow! You look upset, though. Especially in this one. - You were angry. - I think so. It's different. Hey! Look who's coming. He's showing off! - Good to see you. OK? - Fine. - Jenny. - This is Fred. - Nice to meet you. I'm Jenny. - Sami. It's a pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - Dedah. Easy. You're going too far. Don't worry. We give four kisses. - Good. - What a nice moment. - Can you take a photo? - Yes. Look. You have to press this button. Cool! Great. It's been ages. My friends. - Here. - Would you take it again? Come on, you can smile. We're family. Make a funny face. - We're good. - Yes. Thank you. This one's nice. See? - We're handsome. - Look at your face. Looking good. - I look amazing. - Yes, you're gorgeous. You look like you did at 10. And I expect it to stay that way. - Shall we go? - It's about to start. Let's go. It's starting. Let's give them a big hand! The amazing Swaïn! I hope you have warmed up. - It's his big moment. - He looks excited. He's good at this. They are here with the young Sax! Let's hear it for him too. No more talking. You can sing now. How's it hanging? - Have you heard them before? - No. First time. - They're good. - Awesome. - Do want to drink something? - Yes, sure. - What do you have? - Orangina or Pepsi. - Alright. - Pepsi. - Two Pepsis. - OK. - How much? - 1 euro. Won't you introduce us? - Hey, I'm talking to you. - Why would I introduce you? Does she know you're a security guard? Go find yourself a girlfriend. Fuck you! - What are you doing? - What's the matter? - Kill that bastard! - Go fuck yourself! Kill the son of a bitch! Let me go! Calm down! - Fucker! - Screw you! - Shut up. - What's going on? - Let me go! - Let him go. I know him. Let the kid go, too. What the hell is this? - We didn't do anything. - Get out of here! - You know them? - Friends of the band. What happened? Where's Jenny? - Wait. - What's wrong with you? It's a group that bothers me at work. You just charged into them! Do you think it's nice having them bully me here, in front of you? Honestly, I'm not like that. I'm not a violent guy. I'm sorry. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. Let's go. I forgot something. I'll be right back. Dedah, can I speak to you? I need your help. They make my life hell everyday. - Did you try talking to them? - It's impossible. They're brainless. Why do you even worry? Didn't you want to become a doctor? Put some kind of pressure on them. I'll see what I can do. But it's not for free. Is that OK with you? - Got it? - Yes, got it. Wait, I'll do it. It was in the machine. I don't like you to do my laundry. Then do it. Hello? - Hello, Mr. Arezki. - Good evening. - You'll work on Thursday night. - But I work by day. You'll work night and day, then. The job's in the mall. What is it? It's a delivery. What do you say? Will you be there? Alright. Well... This Thursday, at 8 pm. - I'm counting on you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Guys, you can't do that. You're a team. Do as I say: 1, 2 touches, small perimeter. 3rd player, 2 base touches. Talk to each other. Communication is key. As I said before... - This stays between you and me. - Sure. I won't do anything like this again. We'll see when you have money. I don't want your money. I just want to be left alone. It's for tomorrow. As of today, you don't know me. Deal. - Hey. - How are you? - Alright? - Are you working tonight? I asked for us to be together. - We're with two assholes. - Yeah? Never mind. Get on. How did you do in the test? I screwed up. Shit, it's the last one. I hope they'll speed up. Nothing to say. I fucked up. I had placed a bet and... You lost? I lost everything! Here. Thank you. Those bastards teased my dog on the bus. There are days when I could fire into the crowd. The bus driver didn't say anything. Just like in the store: you take one so you can hit the others. - Alright, Steve? - Yeah. You know, I have a car to dismantle. - What kind of car is it? - It's a 306 HDI. Really? What about the mileage? Not too high. We could make some money. The engine's easy to sell. Where the hell are they? Whey aren't they here? Let's call the drivers. You coming? I strip down the engine... What for? Yes, I'm coming. We can go fifty-fifty. - There's no answer. - What? There's no answer. Something's not right. What the hell is that? - I'm going down. - Sure? Stay here. Get out! - Let's go! - What do you mean? - It's none of my business. - Shut up! Those two assholes want to go. - We're not paid for that. - What? Come on. - Don't touch me! - Come on, let's go! Come on. I don't give a damn anyway... - I'm not moving. - What? They will blame us! You'll leave me alone? No, you're coming with us. Fucking shit! Go, go! - Move! - OK. Copy that. Come on, bro! Go, go! Move, move! - They're coming! - Careful! It won't start, Saïd! - It's stuck! - Come on, kick! - Attack! - Shit! Oh, shit! Walid! - Jim! - Get him! You little bastard! Jim! You killed my dog! You son of a bitch! Fucker! What have you done to my dog? What have you done to my dog? You fucking bastard! What did you do to him? What did you do, goddammit? What are you doing? You're out of your mind! Are you alright? Don't move... Don't move. You'll be OK. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - Answer me. Can you hear me? - Yes... You'll be alright. They're on their way. You'll be fine. Stay with me. I'm going to tighten it. Mr. Arezki? Come and sign your statement when you're done. - Sir? - Yes? How is my colleague doing? He's doing fine. But not the kid. Hey! What are you waiting for? - Take it easy. This isn't a factory. - Wait... what? What are you looking at? Don't waste time! What's your problem? One of the thieves, 17-year-old Walid Kassini, died at the hospital. The guard pleads self-defense. I trust my men. They've been trained. The victim was armed and shot at them. His family doesn't believe in that theory. According to them, he was a quiet, reserved boy who loved bikes. How sad... It can't be possible... He asked for it. He used to play football with his friends in the neighborhood. He had no weapon. The guards are lying. However, Walid had a record for misdemeanors. The security guard has been arrested and indicted. Hello? It's Jenny. Are you OK? I can't talk right now. I'll call you back. Yeah, sure. - Sami... - Alright, Chérif? - Where's Dedah? - In the south. - Where exactly? - No idea. Got his number? He keeps changing his number. You know him. Shit! - Have you...? - Leave! - What? - Scram! - Why? - I don't want to see you. - I asked you a question. - I don't give a shit. Get out! What you did was not right. Get lost! You should be ashamed! Chérif! - It has nothing to do with this! - Come on, don't talk to us! Chérif! - Chérif's up there. - He's at home. He's been there for two weeks. - Stay with us. - You're lovely. 4th. I told you I'd call you back. Can I come in? - How do you know where I live? - I need you to tell me. - What? - Where you there when he died? You already know. What do you want to know? I want you to tell me. My parents are on their way. I don't want them to see you. Right. Bye. Police! Is this your bag? Yes. Is this your phone? Yes, it's my phone. Do you know Dedah? We grew up in the same neighborhood. It's a weird coincidence. You were seen with him last week. You're jumping to conclusions. Just because I know Dedah... Anyway, it proves nothing. I have nothing to do with him. We're not saying it was you. But if it was, we'll find out. Very few people slip through the net. The authors of the theft will spend their money and we'll find them. You had issues with them, right? - It wasn't easy but... - You had issues. Doesn't look good for a guard. Is that why you didn't step in? No, it's not because of that! - You knew it was his team. - I didn't know anything at all. I didn't even know he knew them. You have no right. Get off me! Don't you understand? Tell me why I'm here! What have I done? Leave me alone! Get off! Don't touch me! Who gave Dedah the information? I don't know. Was it you? - Did he ever give you money? - No. You searched my place, there's nothing in my account... We're going round in circles. You say you're a student. But you have no courses. I'm a student. Right... You have a job that... You know. What? You must have expected better. You could have been tempted. Do you know where your friend is right now? He's in Spain, enjoying his cash. He's already sold the computers. I don't think he's sorry at all. Why are you protecting him? I'm not... I have nothing to do with him. Chérif, make a little effort, please. Dedah never asked you for anything? Don't think. Just tell us the truth. For God's sake... Read it and sign. Over here, sir, please. It's OK. You can go. You were absent for five days. You weren't on sick leave. I quit. I'm here for my pay. You can't stay like that, with your dark thoughts. Pull yourself together. Work gets you through the hard times. I'll take the night shift, then. Alone. It's better for me. Right! In your state! I had a worker who used to work alone. His wife had dumped him. Well... he killed himself. I didn't see it coming. I won't do that. Can you start tomorrow morning? Checkout to HQ. I'm listening. Take a look at the three youngsters who're coming in. OK. Copy. Hello. We're friends of Agnès. We forgot the invitation. - What's your name? - Jean-Philippe Guillemont. Your name is not on the list. - Look at the 2nd page. - I did. - You barely looked. - Hello. Welcome. - Does this amuse you? - I have nothing else to do. Come on in, please. - Excuse him. He's new. - Thank you. Put me somewhere else. I'm not a good entrance guard. You'll stay here. And do me a favor, calm down. - I let everybody come in? - Please. Hello. Go ahead. Hello. Calm down. I'll see you later. Hello. Welcome. Abdou! I didn't know you were back. Put the barriers away. - How's your arm? - It's OK. Did you resume the trainings? - What is it? - "What is it"? - It wasn't my fault. - We'll see that. - That's not the problem. - What is it? Are you kidding me? I could see it on your face! I was your friend, you didn't trust me. That's the problem! - I didn't know there were weapons. - Leave me alone. This is dangerous. It's sweet, that's why you don't realize. This is off the record, but I believe we'll win the city's contract next year. Really? Congratulations. - And sorry about earlier. - It's OK. You're going through hard times. You have to hold on. This party's nice. It's good for the team. Cheer up... You're young. - No. - Come on. Let yourself go. - It's a big needle. - Yes. OK, very good. - Don't hesitate. - OK. There you go. Perfect. Now you insert the tube. - This one? - The brown one. That's right, go ahead. - Yes, he did it. - Congratulations! All I can say is: "Great. Well done". Now I have to get a compress ready. Yes. Wait until the tube is full. An empty space. That's it. You can stop. Remove the tube. - I just take it out? - Go ahead. - I shake it three times. - Excellent. Should I put it down here? - What do you take out first? - This. Yes, exactly. So, the needle, you have to secure it. Good. Throw it away. Perfect, Chérif. Very good. Who wants to go next? - I do. - OK. Let's go. Throw them away. Thank you, sir. You can put it here. - How are you? - I'm good. What's the new place like? It's alright. - Hello. - Hello. We're ready. Very well. We're going to begin. Go ahead, Mr. Firmin. Wait! Were you in this place, Mr. Arezki? Umm... - I was here. - Alright. So when Steve Firmin released the dog on Walid Kassini, did Kassini already have a weapon in his hand, or was it Jim who shot at your colleague? Actually, it was Walid who took the weapon and tried to shoot the dog. He had his hands on the handlebar. He was ready to leave. Alright. Go ahead, please. Resume. And then? He kicked me and left. Do it, please. Like that? It was like that, no? It was in my stomach, and stronger. It made me fall down. Subtitles: Eclair Media
