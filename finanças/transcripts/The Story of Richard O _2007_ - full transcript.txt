Listen, I'd like a chicken. Not such a chicken, no chicken to eat, ... But chicks... chicks with two legs. And she starts to laugh again. Look for... I love nice chickens. If I find one in my bed... How shall I say... I'll shoot... In one shot. In a single shot. Really, I shoot quite well. So you say that anyway, right? Whether I say it or not? I shoot in one hit. Yes. That means sex anyway? Do you understand me? Madman. Yes, yes, in one hit. Are you going to keep quiet? Do chickens have two legs? If you say so? But they have no wings. No, chickens don't have wings. Okay, then. No, a chicken like you... I'd eat straight from the pan. You're crazy. Yes... And then? So I... No... I have fun anyway, right? Everything is alright... Larmpi, write the bill? In his name? You are sweethearts. Until tomorrow. Good evening. I'm sleeping in your bed. You wait until I have fallen asleep. I want you to be sure I'm sleeping... When you are sure that I sleep deeply... You rape me. Of course I'll wake up. I'll have to defend. You won't let me go and you continue to rape me. Do you understand? Yes. I got your shot. That's all I wanted, film you while you sleep... Just leave. What? Haven't you done what I asked you for? You had to rape me. Didn't you do it? And I trusted you. You have to rape me. Rape me. Rape me. You could rape me. Come on, rape me. Stop. Why didn't you rape me? Hello? Anouk? I've killed a man. What shall I do? I'm coming. THE STORY OF RICHARD O. A few weeks earlier... Good morning... Good morning. I'm looking for models for a video. Yes. Why not? What kind of video exactly? Is my number enough? "I really can't stand... " And I bear it increasingly less, ... Someone dear to me. It irritates me so... It's something... just like something is put in motion, ... and then suddenly dropped off. I'm all the time afraid of being raped. I know that the fear of being raped is actually desire. I think I don't want to be raped by an unknown but maybe in a safe environment... by a guy I know, or who isn't all strange. The fantasy of rape could be implemented... in the moment I just have fallen asleep. It remains a rape... but my physical integrity is remained. If I'm not the one who decides where, when or how... My number? I like the idea of calling myself a whore. I like that. I actually want to submit to sex. I want to be taken so, ... I lose myself completely. Where did you find her? On the street.. I love that... Every part of my body touched, ... kneaded and taken, is coated with... Semen and urine, anything... Unbelievable. She's crazy. She's crazy. I want to completely immerse in sex. That's... I don't make love. I don't like erotica if not disturbed by something. I think the fact of making love... is the desire to obtain something, that embarrasses me. I don't like sexuality. How can I say... I once called a gigolo... lied just next to him in bed. And he did everything I had asked him for. That was really fantastic... sexually. But I absolutely don't feel ready for a guy... who doesn't touch me down there. That was one of my biggest fantasies, I guess. That's it? Have you run out? No. How did you do that? It's my charm. Of course, your charm... Yes. Of course... What would you tell me? I know you. If you look at me, you want to tell me something. You know, Emma... You have such a beautiful bosom. It's enough, Richard. Stop. What? I don't know... I thought it would go, but... I always come back to the same old ... I had found really nice work. I want you, I need you... but I can't. What you can't? Iwon't repeat. Every time I have to say the same things again? It gets really annoying. Don't worry, it's bad for your heart. I can't be with someone, who just wants a child from me. That's all. It isn't the right time. It just isn't the right time. Agree? You put me under so much pressure. Sorry, but I don't put you under pressure. You're different. You choked me. I don't work. You're not working, you do nothing. Your whole life you're in shit. You can't always just do what you want. I have a proposal. What? If we split up, we both do what we want. Want to resist destruction. Something to build on in addition... Against a hazard. Okay? Did you know that testosterone is the hormone of desire... And that of anger? Instead of desire you feel anger. Do you understand? Now let's have a look at your past. The cards explain everything, when you look in the past. A woman. Do you want a relationship with her? Take one card. Is it about just one woman? Not more than one? We'll see. - Just one? - Put a card. No, if there's only one woman, you'll run away. If you think only of a woman, ... you limit yourself. What you're looking for is the whole. From there it isn't important if it's one woman... or many women. Both is possible. See? A naked body means a woman. You are free to choose your path, it could be... a woman or just women. Look. It appears immediately a naked woman. See? Appears immediately a naked woman. Take advantage of it. I won't, hey. I don't know. Basically yes. My first love was my greatest love. Since then I've never really loved someone. That's clear. I knew the mechanism to bind them to me... but I never met the person, I've never met the other... the mechanism, yes. I wanted to prove my father that I can have all the women he never had. And to my mother who always was somewhere else... and then they realized it, the more I found. The whores, the non-prostitutes, the multi -than-whores, the less-than-whores... But what's this all about? Yes. A memory... Not two but one. With an Indian... one night... I never saw her again. We didn't say a word. We slept in the wet grass. It had rained. We were in a garden. It was summer. That felt so good. That smell, entangled with her brown skin... She was so beautiful. With her big eyes... A gem. I had never seen one like her before. My legs were shaking. The sweat dripped off me. It was so nice to have sex with her. It was so nice to penetrate her... Without a condom. That was all. Damned. I came inside her already. Out of love. That is what I remember. And in her eyes I saw that she recognized me. It's hard to explain, but... In her eyes I saw that she loved me. That was incredible. All the love that she had... My dream is that the man... takes me to a certain place, ... where his friends are, and sells me to them. I wish that one day a guy in the street... takes me by the hand on the street and fucks me in a stairway... and then runs away. Do you like wine? Good food? Yes, yes, I know a good place. Tomorrow afternoon? Shall I send the address by sms? It's not too busy. Until tomorrow. Thanks. And? What do we do? What's it all about? If I'm at work, I don't talk. I just don't like. And if I make love, or fuck... I can't work anymore. And when I work, ... I can't make love, or fuck. Right? And that goes on and on. And I think that this must stop. Look, see... that it takes... Video, images, that's all shit. Prepare yourself, eh? But, have you seen my video then? Yes. Do you understand me? Yes. Take me from behind. Yes, take me. Catch me like a bitch. Tell me I'm a dirty bitch. Come on. Tell me I'm a whore. I'm your whore. I'm your whore. Say it louder. You're my whore. Come on, fuck me hard. You are a whore. Fuck me hard. Whore. I'm your dirty whore... Your dirty bitch. Hey. You okay? Yes. And you? All right. What are you doing here? I wanted to talk. I listen. I have experienced something strange. And that keeps haunting me. Those women who... Richard, it doesn't interest me. We had planned not to meet for a while. Actually. Yes, that was your idea. Yes. Since you have that aversion for the word 'couple', I wanted to go apart. So everyone can do what he wants. When we meet again, it's not for dirty stories. It's something perverse, right? Yes. But you'll understand me. I? I also experienced something... But I don't feel like talking with you about it. I'm a beast. I must say that this is the last time I come. I'm tired of prostitutes. I want free women. My tits look different, huh? It's huge, what they did with them. Yes, and next time they'll be even larger. What? Yes, 20 percent extra. 20 percent? Yes, yes, certainly. In one time? Yes, in one time. Where do you keep them? Like the Americans, I do wear them. Say goodbye to them. So. One... and two. Goodbye. You are brave. Ciao. Yes. Sit, Tom. Sit. Sit. Come on. Sit. A man has to give his wife as many orgasms... as possible, but he himself must have as few as possible. The monkey fighting. The woman is on her back. The man puts her legs on his shoulders... And directs his spear towards her entrance. With a furtive smile... he moves the woman so the liquid can penetrate her... and then she gets up. What are you doing? You have an appointment at the hotel. How many more? I have a whole list. I don't want. Room 13. She expects you. And her name? I don't know. Caress yourself a bit. Are you crazy? That's disgusting. Don't you see my injuries? How deep they are and how swollen... Bastard. Don't talk to me, let me... Thanks. Cheers. For happiness, and our loved ones. You simply stole that piece of chocolate cake.. Oh come on. But it's nice.... We'd a good anyway, didn't we? Please stop it now. Shut up... Come on, Christian. Come on. Richard, open the door. Damn... Her again. Open up. Richard. Excuse me. Open up. Richard. Stop it. Open up, Richard. I don't have time. Last night while we made sex you said that we... were made for each other. We'll have a party another time. Please go home now Ms. Douneaux. Open up, Richard. Open up. Go away. Go away. It's a game that I play with my neighbour. She's crazy. Destroyed by the French Revolution... Tourists! Paris says shit to you. Please reply anyway, idiots. Paris says shit to you. What have you done with that tall man? You help him, don't you? I'm not helping him... he helps me. It's like a homeless person that asks you for money. You think you're helping him. But actually he gives you a gift. You know what I like about you, Richard? Your survival instinct. Come closer... Your cheek... I can't. Damn. Do I speak Vietnamese? Did you hear me talk Vietnamese, huh? I don't speak Vietnamese. Did you think all Asians speak Vietnamese? It's not only because you're ordering in Vietnamese... that you also speak Vietnamese. In a Vietnamese restaurant, you eat Vietnamese. And you don't know any other Vietnamese words. Eat at a Vietnamese restaurant? Come on... don't make me ridiculous. Of course... You're just another crazy Frenchman... who comes here every Sunday to eat a soup... and who thinks all Asians are alike. So you go from... I've come here with my pushcart and I'll have my straw hat on... and ordered a bowl of white rice? - No! Listen, honey: I'm French, I was born here... And I speak French. Okay? And don't say that I must mention it, because I don't. Isn't it true? It's damn true. I'm so tired. I don't understand. Why that racist behaviour? We can only fight back if we're harassed. I imagined to eat quietly dinner with you. I thought it would be cool, it would be a nice little dinner. But you make me angry again. You know what? Forget all this... because I've had enough, I'm fed up. I listen. Have you chosen? I take an Entrec?te with Roquefort. How do you eat your steak? Bleu. Me too. Roger. Yes? Hey, my prince? Well, we take the whole menu. Sorry. Damn, fool. I'll get a towel or something... Excuse... Stop it. Stop it, you irritate me. Stop it. Stop it. You think I'm stupid? I told you to cease. I told you to cease. What can I do with this angry guy. Sorry... Do you understand now? Yes. Was that Jiu-Jitsu, what you do did to me? No, wrestling. Like in the film? Don't be afraid, I'm not gonna hurt you. I have a lot...anger. I'm very eager, because I really need it. Okay, I'll show you the Rotating Main Handle. As the name suggests, Take your head down... and we throw the opponent on the ground. Got it? Arm. From start here... On your knees... Wrestling involves mainly agility. You must be flexible and relaxed. Always very smooth. Much agility and... relaxation. Understand? Yes. Very good. Get up. Catch and...throw. You must be clear in your head. Flexibility... wrestling is smooth and fluent. I like wrestling. My balls are squeezed to a pulp. I could refuse, by saying 'no', if I had the choice... or I could accept it. Because if I would wrestle with him, I wouldn't have a chance. For me, wrestling with someone who's much stronger... leads to other physical fantasies... about really strong men. ...strong in the sense that they want me to dominate. Richard, come inside. How old were you when you started to talk again? Twenty eight years. So you didn't speak for three years? Yes. I also had another brother. He's dead. He died at the age of twenty. He shot a bullet through his head with a gun that allegedly was broken. A gun from the First World War. That's sad. The family... The weather is nice. And what does your brother now? He's makes fishing flies. Fishing flies? Yes. What do you mean? He puts them together. He makes hooks? No, no hooks. Hooks... This is the float... I'll explain. A float... - Yes? There's a pin through it. So you push a pin through it... So, and then throw up... No, no, if not... Not? Great. At first I didn't know what I should think of you. I like doing or I'm stupid. It amuses me how people look... at me. You're right. That's the best way to going through life as a retard. Sometimes I would really like to look like you. Live inside your body, feel what you feel. Would you come home to me? Where do you live anyway? In my heart. Your wine is delicious. I'm... Are you lost? So am I. I'm in my studio. Yes. Have you eaten yet? That's my assistant... A little problem with... Wait... wait. Yes. Don't you have that one? No, no, sir. This was two days ago. It's a bit murky. Let me. Please. Natural wines without sulphur. What do you think? Very good. We'll take that. One bottle. For this evening... no, for right now. No... For right now. No, never mind... Take the bottle as it is? Yes, yes. Thanks. Drink it empty. Thanks, Thierry. Until tomorrow. Until tomorrow. Thanks. What are those shoes? What are they? Those are my wrestling shoes. I follow lessons in wrestling. Since when? Since I started wrestling. Congratulations... Unbelievable. What? What? You're crazy. That's okay. What...? You havn't seen me wrestling. But I can imagine. No, I think you can't imagine. You want to look sexy? That's not the problem. What's the problem then? Who I am. A wrestler... Yes. It's... It's a matter of balance. Stop. Stop. I feel good with you. Fuck me. That's exactly what I'm going to do. I'll teach you what respect is. She's beautiful, really beautiful. Something I've never seen before. I need to talk about something. It's a matter of life or death. I have a real relationship now. I love his voice so much. I don't know what it is. I plan to give up my work to live with him. Maybe we have children to seal our love. So we'll make the same mistake as our parents. But it is their fault. I respect their opinion though. But I need to do things as I think it should. That's right. How do you say that again? Intuitive. Yes, and much more. I've not only learned to give but also to dare and to receive. He's very tall, and independent. What a change. No... I'm not a nurse anymore. My friend was goofing around... Me too... Until later. Bye. Wait. You have to look at me. I've had enough beer. Wait... I'll have a little more water on. Yes, that's nice... That... Say it: this is the sauna. That the sauna. The sauna... Go ahead. The sauna. Sauna. Sauna. Sauna. Quite right, the sauna. I'm the one who has seen I talk to the darkness... And I've no fear anymore. Love for life, Love for death. Life with Love, Life with Death. A few weeks later... You've moved a lot. And you told me too, but I didn't understand everything. In my dream I saw Richard with some women... Since his death... it was the first time I I dreamed about him. He looked as if he was lost somehow. It was strange. He examined the bodies. And for a short moment I could see it... Finally he had found his wife. Richard is supposed to be dead. But actually he isn't. Translated by The Huge Animal From The North
