Eh, nice day for a jog, huh? Oh, yes, really gets the creak out of the old joints. [Creepy barking] Stop that, Creepy. Heel, heel. - Yikes! - No, no. My heel. [Frankenstone laughs] That's a good octo-pup. He just started obedience school. Well, this is where I turn off, Frank. Right-O. Happy jogging. Hm. Great breakfast, Wilma. Any more toast? Coming right up, dear. Oh, look, here comes Barney jogging again. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. That Barney. He falls for every fad that comes along. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. [laughs] Forget it, Pebbles. The only good thing about joggin' is when you stop. chomp chomp chomp I don't know, Fred but I think Barney's in better shape than I've ever seen him. Oh, yeah? So what's wrong with this shape? Oh, it's fine, dear. A little flabby, but fine. Flabby? Are you kiddin'? Watch this, Wilma Flintstone. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Alright, Mr. Muscles so you think you're so physically fit, huh? Uh, well, I, I didn't say-- Yeah, well, I bet you can't do this, smart guy. - But, Fred.. - Flabby? I'll show you flabby. Now, would you to stop joggin' when I'm talkin' to ya? Now, how about this? Huh? Huh? Fred, you just ate! And let's see ya...top this.

Now, would you come inside and tell me what that was all about? - 'I can't.' - Why not? Somethin' pulled and I can't move. Oh, Fred, I should've stopped you. [Fred groaning] (Wilma) You're not getting any younger, you know? Baloney! I'm the same as the day we met. Fred, the day we met, I was working in a doctor's office and you were carried in with a bad back. See, what'd I tell ya? Ooh. Easy, easy. Ooh! Ah! Ouch!

[groaning] Oh, hi, Fred. - Hello, Fred. - How you doin', pal? So anyway, I got my joggin' up to four miles now. Yeah, I'm joggin' five, and I never felt better. Say, how about that ball game last night, huh? Those Bedrock Buns really came through. Sorry, Fred, I missed the game. I was out for my evening jog. Let me tell you guys about this new joggin' camp I found. Will you guys knock it off with your stupid joggin'? Anybody who jogs has blisters on the brain. What? [nervous chuckle] Not you, Mr. Slate. [nervous chuckle] Huh! [laughs] You were sayin', Fred? Ha ha ha. [groaning] [all laughing] [groaning] Gee, you're puttin' on weight. Can you knock it off? [snickering] [squawks] [horn blows] Hey, lunch already? [groaning] [sighs] I hope he goes easy on the dessert. What's up, Mac? It's the annual company physical. Huh. They're wastin' their time with me. I am in peak condition. Yeah. I thought you looked peaked. (male #1) 'Move it in.' Okay. Let's see how your blood pressure's doin'. Be my guest. [rapid heartbeat] Oh, boy, this guy is an accident lookin' for a place to happen. One hundred and fifty-two pounds. Next. thud Oh, boy. The results of the annual employees' physical are in and I congratulate you all on your fine fitness scores. [clears throat] Uh, Flintstone, can you step into my office? Why, certainly, Mr. Slate. Flintstone, your score was a disgrace to the quarry. And unless you shape up, you're going to be shipping out. (Slate) 'If I were you, I'd start jogging' 'first thing in the morning.' (Fred) 'First thing in the mornin'?' - 'But, but, but, but--' - No but, but, but, buts. - Now, back to work. - Yes, sir. So we're finally gonna see you joggin', huh, Flintstone? No, you won't see me. I'll be movin' too fast. Come on, Flintstone, next time you'll be tellin' us you're enterin' the Rockstone Marathon. I'm not only gonna enter that marathon, I'm gonna win. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. thud Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. My advice is, forget the whole thing, Fred. Nobody from Bedrock ever entered the Rockstone Marathon. Besides, it's only a week away. Barney, my mind's made up. Anyway, all I have to do to run a dumb marathon is stick one foot in front of the other. Trouble is, you've already stuck both feet in your mouth. [laughs] How would you like it in your mouth? [Barney laughing] I need a trainer. Are you with me? Oh, well, sure, Fred, but, uh-- No buts. We start trainin' at sunrise tomorrow. Now, don't be late. [serene music] [Fred snoring] Here I am, Fred. Bright and early, just like you said. Wake up, Fred. Barney's here. Fred! [snoring] It's no use. We'll never get him up. Uh, don't worry, Wilma. I'll have him on his feet in no time. Attaboy, good. Now, jump, jump, jiggety-jump. [instrumental music] Uh, see you later, Wilma. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Hey, you're lookin' good, Fred, real good. Fred? Yikes! splash Fred! Stop! [dramatic music] [growls] splash Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Fred, what's going on? [mumbles] Oh, I just had a horrible dream about goin' joggin'. That was no dream. It was a nightmare. Look at you. You're both a mess. What happened? I don't know, but it's not gonna happen again. I'm through with train'. I'm callin' it quits. - You can't quit, Fred. - Oh, I can't, huh? Give me one good reason why not. Because I already mailed in your entry. You what? [knock on door] Ooh! TV! TV! Hi, we're here to interview Fred Flintstone. Bedrock's first entrant in the famous Rockstone Marathon. Uh, ah.. I-I'm afraid you're a few minutes too late. He, uh, just-- Ah, there he is! Mr. Flintstone, you, sir, are a man of fortitude and courage. An inspiration to hundreds of Bedrock youngsters watching right now. - I-I am? - 'You bet.' And all your fans would love to see you in action 'doing some roadwork.' Well, I, I can't let my fans down, can I? (Fred) Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. That was the shortest retirement in sports history. Yeah, I'll say. And there you see him, ladies and gentlemen Bedrock's hope for victory. Sure the light's right? It sets off my profile, you know. [groaning] Look at that grace. He's truly poetry in motion, eh, folks? Here they come. And Fred's runnin' faster than ever. I never knew he had so much energy. (male #2) 'Look at him turn on the speed with his race-winning kick!' fizz [groaning] thud [barks] Down, Dino, down. Fred, are you alright? Oh, Wilma, the only part of me that doesn't ache is my head. - Ouch! - Ah, there you are, Flintstone. - Oh, Mr. Slate? - Good boy. Doing a few sit-ups, eh? Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. Si-si-sit-ups. And gotta keep in shape, you know? We all saw you on TV, Flintstone and I rushed over to tell you how proud we are. Well, I'm so glad you did. Yes, sir, we're behind you all the way. And I know you won't let us down. See you at work, my boy. [gulps] Now what am I going to do? There's only one thing to do, Fred. - What? What? - Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. [laughs] [groaning] [instrumental music] Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. Jog, jog, jiggety-jog. [chuckling] [all cheering] [crowd cheering] [snoring] (Slate)'Flintstone, my boy,you're a credit to the quarry.' And since this is the last day before the marathon I've decided to give you the whole day off. Oh, Mr. Slate, that's the best news I-- Yes, sir, Flintstone 'now you can train all day long.' - But, but, but-- - 'No, no, don't thank me.' It's the least I can do for the next winner of the Rockstone Marathon. Now, jog, jog, jiggety-jog. 'Jog, jog, jiggety-jog.' Wilma.. [instrumental music] Gosh, Wilma, I'm having so much fun. And the food's delicious. Yes. Too bad Fred has to eat and run. - Go get 'em, Flintstone! - Tear 'em up, champ. Glad you liked my suggestion, Flintstone. Training right on the plane. Oh, sure. A great idea. Bleh. When you blaze across the finish line and win it'll all be worth it. In fact, we've written a song in your honor. Hit it, boys.

You tell 'em whatever you want. I have had it. Dear, I know you're tired and nervous. So, why don't you just try to get some sleep and see how you feel about it when you wake up, okay? I'll try to get some sleep, but it's not gonna change my mind. - Shh. - Shh. "Get some sleep." Huh. I'm too upset to sleep. [instrumental music] - Pebbles. - Hi, daddy. - Had a nice rest? - Eh, Pebbles, you can talk. I can run too. And that's why I'm entering the Rockstone Marathon in your place. You? In a marathon? I have to. A Flintstone gave his word he'd run so a Flintstone's gonna run. 'The Flintstones aren't quitters.' But-but-but.. Don't worry, daddy, you'll be proud of me. 'I won't let the family down.' Wait, Pebbles! Come back! Come back! Don't wait up for me, Wilma. I have a lot of roadwork to do tonight. - Roadwork? - Yup. There's not much time left until tomorrow's race.

You let your wife and all your friends down. Maybe you ought to just keep goin' right out the other end of the stadium and never come back. [cheering] Huh? Who's that? Wilma! Barney! You waited for me. Yeah. And Freddy boy, you are the greatest. (Fred) 'But, Barney, I didn't win.' In fact, I came in last. That doesn't matter, honey. You stuck it out. You didn't give up.
