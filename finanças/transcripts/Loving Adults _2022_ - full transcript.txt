Almost all murders have something to do with love. In fact, half of all murders are committed by the spouse or partner. And it's almost always about jealousy and passion. That's why I never believed the theory of an accidental hit-and-run. I think he had been sitting there, Christian, in the dark and the rain, waiting for his wife Leonora. They warn you about all kinds of things. Smoking, alcohol... But not the worst threat of all. I mean, love should come with a written warning. "Love kills." But it was never proven. He was never convicted. No. And that was my fault. Dad, you know how many cases you've solved. This one haunts me still. Perhaps it was an accident. You can't be certain. Three nights before she was hit, at 3:55 a.m., Christian received a text message. Who is it? It was just work. Who would text you about work at four in the morning? It was Peter. All right? Can we go back to sleep? - Let me see your phone? - Turn that off. - Are you serious? - Yeah. You want to check my text messages? No. I want to know who's texting you at this hour. - Uh... I don't want to. - Why not? - Uh, because... - Because you're cheating. What? No, hey! What's going on? - Why the hell are you acting so guilty? - I'm... I'm... I'm half asleep, Leonora. You'll wake Johan. Then show it to me. No. - Why not? - Because... It's the principle. We... we have to learn how to trust each other. Well, I don't trust you right now. Well, you have to, all right? Show me. - I can't. - Why not? Because it's Peter, okay? He's seeing someone. And it's about her. You know, I promised him... I swore that I'd keep it a secret. - Now I know already. - Yeah. Thanks a lot. So you can show me. It says the name of the girl, and you know her too. I don't care who Peter's been fucking. Show me. What are you... Hey, stop. Will you let go? Hey, come on. Let go. Christian was a trained craftsman, but he had studied to become an engineer. He and his friend, Peter, founded a construction company, which quickly grew into a big success. As a young woman, Leonora was a very talented musician. She won several competitions as a violinist and had been accepted to a music conservatory. But she had to set aside her career when their son, Johan, became seriously ill. He had been fighting for his life for years, but he was finally getting better. - Good morning. - Good morning. Fourteen point two kilometers. My hair, Mom. Good morning. Morning. Dad, are you taking me? Yes, if you help me with the midsummer bonfire later. - Forget it. I'll take the bus. - What? - You're a piece of work. - Hey, I... I can take you, sweetheart. Could you? I have a lot on my plate. - Mm-hmm. - Thanks. Sorry for last night. No, I... was being stupid. Should I take it in for you? No, don't worry about it. It was old. I have to wash the car anyway, and the phone store is right there. - Mom, let's go. - All right. Nah, it's okay. It should be thrown out. Thanks though. Okay. Midsummer Eve is approaching, and we're the only country that burns witches at midsummer. But why do we have this tradition? I have to say it is both a... Can we pick up Martha? ...and brutal tradition that dates all the way back... Who's Martha? Just a girl from school. Ah. Martha. Yeah. - Hi. Good morning. - Hi. Good to see you. You too. You look nice. Thanks. Don't you look cute! What? I can't stop smiling. I'm just so happy to see you. What are you even saying? KOLIBRI ARCHITECTS BUILDING TEACHERS' COLLEGE - Morning, boss - Good morning. - Morning, Steen. - Morning. Nice work on those units yesterday. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Has Xenia come in? Yes. She's over there somewhere. Christian? The IRS asked to see our accounts. - Is it cool? - Yeah, I hope. How far will they go back? The accountant says it's a routine sample picked by a computer. Then why tell me? We agreed if something important came up, then we... If it's routine, it's not important. How long have we known each other? Trust me. See you tonight. Are you gonna speak? I'm not letting you do it. Hello? Yes. Yes, I'm glad you called. The thing is... Hi. Hi. Do I look tired? You are... the prettiest woman I've ever seen. You are. The birds woke me at four. - Yeah, apparently so. - Did I wake you? Mm-hmm. And not just me. It turned into a huge fight. Did you read my messages? I didn't get a chance. You didn't get a chance? What'd you say? What did she say? That Christian should make a decision before they met. About her? Her or Leonora. An ultimatum. Who'd he pick? At this point, I can only guess. When I saw you smiling at me, I thought you'd made up your mind. But you didn't read anything I wrote. I have made up my mind. It's a matter of timing. Christian, you've said that for six months. - Johan's been cured. - Yeah. He'll be off his crutches very soon. Mm-hmm. So you have to be there for him and your wife? - Well, for him, yes. He's my son. - Yes. It's not about you. I will not be your fool, Christian. I haven't loved anyone as much as you. If you won't act on it, they're just words. I said it last night and still mean it today. I wanna have kids. I want... I want it all! I want that too. But we have to get the timing... Hey! We could be so fucking great together. One gold wash, please. Should I put 100 on an account? I just want a gold wash for 79. The account cards start at 100. But you can put in 300 and get a 20% discount on all washes. But I just want a gold wash. Yeah, we only sell the cards. Then a gold wash doesn't cost 79, it costs 100. Well, you hold the card. And the next time you come in, you can put more on... Next time, there's 21 kroner I won't be able to use to wash my car. Then you just add more money. With a minimum of 100? Yeah. Then it's 121, and then when I wash my car again, that leaves 42 kroner. Make it for 200. Okay. - There you go. - Thanks. You wouldn't believe where people drop their phones. Sewers, toilets. You name it. Yes, I dropped mine when I was going for a swim, and I... Some important messages I hadn't read yet. I'm not sure just how it works. Can I still read them? Yes, I think we can recover them. Just give me one moment here. Uh... let me see... Yes, well, I have a Christian Holm registered. Are you sure you gave me the right number? KOLIBRI ARCHITECTS SINGLE - Hello? - Yeah, he's my husband. The account's in his name. Ah... okay. Gotcha. Listen... I'm afraid I'm not allowed to do that. You have to talk... Hello? Yeah, up here. Where's Johan? Uh, he's at Martha's place. - Martha? - Yeah, things going on. Remember when we were that age? We were barely 20. Zip me up? There... It's been a while, hasn't it? I need to shower before we go. I promised Peter I'd be there early, and you know him. Thank you. Friends, uh, business partners, assholes... Listen... I have no doubt whatsoever. The world has to change. We must live in a new and different way if there is to be a world in 50 years. All of those changes must come from both tangible and unimaginable places. And in our case it was Xenia who convinced Peter and me that the teachers' college we're building should of course be self-sufficient with CO2-neutral energy. This way, every material used can be turned back to nature once we're through using the building. To think those thoughts takes courage. It requires a unique mindset to be so visionary and innovative. Well, Xenia, you have that mindset, and it's like nothing I've ever seen. - Come on up. Get some applause! - Yeah! Xenia Mikkelsen, ladies and gentlemen, our star architect. Thank you so much, everybody. - Cheers! - Yes, cheers! Cheers, everyone! Have a great night! I couldn't wait to get away. You look so sexy tonight. You okay? Is something wrong? I'm just tired. I guess that's it. - Does it look all right? - Mm-hmm. Sure. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, I'm fine. Didn't sleep enough. Oh. That's your age. I can relate. So, uh... Kim? - When you and Anette got a divorce... - Mm-hmm? How'd you tell her? You met a girl? - No. It's not like that. - Christ! No, no. Neither had I... I said. But I mean... It's not a fun thing to do. And it's a tough thing to say, but they're better off as well. The women. Everyone's better off when a worn-out relationship is over. And Anette? Yeah, she's doing good now. She's... It's... She's doing some further education or something. But if you need a fresh start, then my advice is tell her the full shebang. The sooner, the better. And it doesn't feel good at first. It doesn't. But, uh... It's better, ya know? It gets good. After I told her, for two years I'd get home, and I was going, "Yes!" "Yes! I'm free!" It was awesome. It was like, "Yeah! Freedom! Thank you!" - Shut up. - It's true. You're an idiot. - Well... - You're so stupid. Leonora... I need to have, uh... uh... time to think. I think. I've had a lot on my plate for the last few years. I've... lost myself, I guess. You know what I mean? You've said that you've been frustrated too and... that we don't have time to ourselves. Johan's illness has required lots of attention. You seeing someone? That's not the point. This is about us. I... I can't see myself in this... now. You're not seeing anyone? No. I saw you last night, Christian. From Peter's office. I saw what you... She looked at me, straight in the eyes. What kind of person does that? Oh, I'm really, really... Leonora, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... You didn't mean to? You fuck your mistress at an event you brought your wife to? How long has it been? I don't want to hurt you. Leonora... That's the last thing I want to do. Are you aware I can get busted for that scam you pulled even if you run off with her? What? I spoke to our lawyer, and I'd be an accomplice, you know. But not if I go to the police now and report you for fraud. So... Wait a minute. You're... I did what I had to do to save our son. Have you gone completely insane? Huh? If he hadn't had those operations in the States, he'd be dead today. Several times I said a loan was an option. No it wasn't! I said I could have started working again so many times. I said it 15 years ago when I could've continued with my career. Your career? Okay. That wouldn't have cut it, Leonora. - And who would care for Johan? - Yes! Very good question! - Could you have done that? - No, I couldn't. Because I had to earn the money, and you... We had an agreement. Exactly. Christian, we had a deal. And I sacrificed my entire career for that deal. You worked, and I watched Johan. We did what we had to do, and we did it as a team. So now what do I do? You can do so much. You... You... You could teach. Teach? You have no idea what you're talking about. I can't even sub now! A violinist my age who hasn't played in 20 years? I gave up all that! And now you sit there feeling sorry for yourself just because you fell in love and want to leave! Well, I have to think about myself. So what are you saying? I'm going to the police. I have to. To say what? We did it for our son as a team. I will let you go. But I'm not going down like Kim's wife. You know where she works? In a fucking supermarket. That's not happening to me. Not after all I gave. I gave plenty as well! I have worked non-stop. I gave Johan my spinal cord! You spent two hours laying on a table. I could have been paralyzed. Is that the story you tell? You've sacrificed because a brochure said there was a 1% risk of complications? I've shared his every breath and stayed at his side since he was born. And now I stand as an accomplice in a crime that you'll get rich. Hey. Is this about the money? - Because of course we'll... - It's not. It's not about money. This is about the fact that we had a deal. A pact. You and me and Johan. We were a team. And we all made sacrifices for that agreement. And leaving was an option we sacrificed. If you leave now, I'll think only about me. That's all there is to it. It's not to punish you. I wonder how fantastic Xenia will think you are after five years in prison. I just need to understand what you're asking me. - I'm nervous. - Nervous? Isn't it a little late for that? We can say we just found a mistake we had made. A mistake? Yes. Mistakes are easy to make and then discover... No. We broke the law, Christian. We manipulated the exchange rate. Will you find out if there's a way we can pay back what we made? And I'll pay for your share. Christian, man, who are we gonna to pay it back to? We pressed the rate to make a profit. Nobody lost money, right? Whatever the case, it's better to tell them ourselves. You were the one who needed the money back then. Well, damn it, you went along! Sorry. - Is something up? - No. We're not making this right, Christian. We're keeping our mouths shut, okay? Yes. Christian? Okay. Where are we at, you and me? I told her. It's done. So it's you and me? Of course. Together. Christian, I know it's a difficult time, but there's a small favor I need. Yes, of course. My mom is in town with her boyfriend, and she's not here often. I'd really like for you to meet her. - Today? - Mm-hmm. Do you want to? Yes, of course. I love you. I love you. That's gonna be a great bonfire, isn't it? It's way bigger than the one Per and those guys made last year, isn't it? - Christian? - What? The bonfire. Yeah. Is it like hell at home? Things are not good. Not good. Leonora, she, uh... won't let me go. Well, it's not really up to her, right? She has dirt on me. Oh, the threats. Been there too. What'd you do? Uh, well, I... I actually did nothing. She went to see some old friends and then... They supported her, talked to her, and made her believe she'd have a new, better life without me. But Leonora hardly knows anyone. Johan has taken up all her time. Well, there must be someone. I don't think she'll talk to anyone. But you can't. You can't be leaving and be the shoulder for her to cry on. I mean... Find an old friend of hers. Someone to support her. But Dad, how can you be positive Leonora followed him? We can tell by the cell phone towers. We can see they were driving their own cars. One behind the other. And Christian was going to town to track down Leonora's old friend, Kassandra. I'll be damned. I hardly recognized you. How many years is it? Well, I'm not even sure. It must've been at the christening, right? How old is Johan now? - He'll be 18. - Ah! - Graduates tomorrow. - That's crazy. - Mm-hmm. - Eighteen years? You haven't talked to her at all since then? Not at all. Best friends and then nothing at all. Leonora has always been completely either or. Either you were in or you were out. Mm-hmm. She's not the type you can just leave. What do you mean? She had a... an old boyfriend. Mike. Did she talk about him? Mike? Not that I recall. It's just... He died. Okay... Yeah, it was a really sad story where we grew up. No, she never mentioned it. It was a... a terrible story. He fell off a cliff and died on impact. I don't know much. I wasn't there. - But he was with Leonora? - Yes. They were an item. And then... They said that he was leaving Leonora. And he was with some other girl that night. Who are "they"? I mean... You know... Rumors. It was a small town. Okay, and what was the rumor? That Leonora pushed him. That sounds completely insane. Yeah. Listen... The man that I married... We had babies. I found out later he'd been in love with another woman for 12 years. She had a husband, so they had a kind of... A marriage in secret. I knew nothing. We fall in love and get married, not really knowing the person. I had some good advice when I was getting divorced. You have to look at it as, well, a trade-off. Money, house, the kids. And then there's the other side of the deal. The threats, the disclosures, and who tells the kids what. Whose fault is it? It's good to have something to bargain. What was the name of the girl Mike left her for? Hello? Hi, this is Sonja. Sonja. Thanks for calling. I... I only have a few minutes. That's fine. Kassandra said that, uh... maybe you saw someone when Mike died. Can you tell me about that? Uh, well, m... most of all it was a feeling. A feeling. Okay. But... can you tell me what happened? Well, we, uh... We had a party. And then Mike and I, we... You know... - Yeah, you were a thing. - Yes. - We were very much in love. - Where are you two going? Mike. Did you see anything? Well, I don't know for certain, but I had this feeling that someone was watching us. Did you see Leonora? Maybe, I... I will never forget that scream. But did you see her? Yes or no? Yes. I was certain. There. That evening. It was Leonora. Did you tell the police back then? Sonja told the police everything back then. I read it all. What was in the police report? Leonora had been brought in for questioning. And she and Mike had, um, parted ways. In one interview, Sonja was sure that she saw Leonora. In the next one, she was not. But Leonora had been practicing all evening at her school. And the music teacher was... was questioned also. Leonora's alibi checked out. Cheers! Are you going running? You need to pack your things. I want you out of the house. Fine. But are you reporting me? That won't happen, right? Leonora, I... talked to your old friend. Kassandra. She told me about your old boyfriend. Mike. She said... he met someone and wanted to leave you. Sonja. And then... suddenly, he was dead. They say you killed Mike. And no one leaves you. You're way out. Do you hear yourself? I'm not saying... I'm just... You need someone you can talk with, Leonora. I think you really need help. You're sleeping with someone else. And you show up with an old urban legend about me killing my boyfriend. That's called demonizing, Christian. And you're the one who needs help. Are you packing? I can't. Not if you're gonna report me to the police. If you want to stay, you have to end it with her. Call her now. I want to hear it. All right. Then I'll call the police. I'm not gonna be cheated by you then dragged down by your fraud. Leonora, stop. Would you stop, please? Hey. Why do you want this? Why do you want me when I'm saying I love her. You think you're what this is about? It's about something bigger, and you've forgotten what matters. Family. So for the last time, you either call her and end it right now, or I call the police and Xenia can visit you in jail if she wants. Leonora... I'm begging you. - Just... - Then do it! S... Hi, Christian. My mom was nuts about you. Um... uh... Hi, Xenia. Uh... I... I can hardly hear you. Hey... - Christian. Are you there? - Uh... Christian. Are you there? I can't. I can't. Look, I know it's... I know it's not fair to you. But... But I love her. More than anyone ever. - Get out. Out! - I'm not... - Get out right now! - Let go! Calm down! Get out! You're going now! - Hey! - Get out! Calm d... Oh! Hey! - Get out! - Leonora! Think about Johan. What about him? You're making him lose everything! Whose side do you think he'll be on? Out! Here! We're switching cars. From now on it's my Mercedes! My house! And my son! It's the same instinct with an animal. When there are no other options and it's been cornered, it will attack. I think he went to the office first. He left his cell phone there and made sure the cleaning staff saw him. Covered his bases. That seems very calculated for him to plan. Some people have it in them. Even when desperate, even if they lose it all, they keep a cool head. It's a survival mechanism. An instinct. When all your feelings are suspended, except for one... Hatred. CAR WASH Fucking bitch. - Oh, hello! - Hello. - You're still here? Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Just needed a coffee, ya know. Working all night. - Good for you. Good night. - Good night. So anyway, we were beat too at that point... Hi, Dad. Hi. You're home? Yeah, the final's tomorrow. Is it? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, of course. I should be asking you that. Final exam and all. Then you put on your cap on and all that. Yeah. Have you seen Mom? - Dad, you sure you're okay? - Yeah, yeah. It's just been a long day. I'm gonna take a shower. Okay. What are you doing here? What's going on? What's your deal? Did you rethink your plans and break up with her? Mm-hmm. What made you do that? I... - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetie. I didn't know you were home. How long have you been here? A couple of hours. 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. I'm on top of it. Are you okay? You hungry? No, Mom. Stop it. It's fine. Okay. Well... I'll take a shower. I'm totally beat. My new route is almost 20 kilometers. Your new route? Yeah. In the woods. It's gorgeous. Haven't we always been good together? Yeah. Is there something you want to try? Something new? Like what? Hmm... We could get something? I don't know... Sex toys? Would you like that? Yeah. Why are you here? Can we talk about it tomorrow? It was a... hard night for both of us. Do you still want me? Yes. Johan is next door. He's still awake. I have to feel if you mean it. If you're over her. Sorry. Sorry. Can't we just... Give me a chance, okay? Can I please just... May I hold you please? Please? Is that okay? We're taking Mom's. Uh, why? - Uh, because, well, she... - Hey, hey, whoa... You aren't going to say goodbye to your mother? - Mm-hmm. - Mom! I'm in a hurry. I know, but don't I get to wish my son good luck? Yes. - Good luck. - Thanks. Thanks for that. - Hi. - Hi. Have you heard? This lady was run over and killed last night. What? Right on that dangerous stretch after the bend. - That's awful. - Dad. Come on. - I have to... - Of course, Christian. We'll talk later. It's awful right? - The bend? - Yeah. - Last night? - Yes. It wasn't that late. Honestly, it's so sad. The police are at the crime scene now. - That's where I normally run. - Oh, yeah? They say he just drove off. How could anyone do something like that? Who was she? Mother of three out for a run. - Isn't it just awful? - Yes. It's my usual route. Yes, yes. Yes, okay. Yeah, yeah. No. You don't need to. That's fine. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Bye. Holger, the rain hasn't helped, so I'll send CSI home. You saw her. But you didn't talk? Uh-uh. Not till later. At their son's grad party. ONE HONK = ONE SIP THREE HONKS = CHEERS! Tell me, did my head shrink since I graduated? Yours fits better. It suits you better too. - Where'd you find it? - In the basement. - I think that's Peter. Will you... - Yeah. Christian? Uh... It's the police. - Hi there. - Hello, guys. We're going door to door in the hope we can find some help. Yeah. They're here about that lady who was hit. - Oh. Yeah. - Yeah. Yes. Uh... Were you at home that night around 10:00 or 10:30? Night before last? Wasn't that the night when you were late getting home? - I think Johan said... - Yes. I was, uh... I was working late at the office. Mm-hmm. When did you get home? It was around, um... What time was it? I don't know. Hello? The door was open. - Peter. - So... - Where is my godson? - He's right out here. Johan, look who's here. - Hello, my boy! - Hey! - Congratulations. - So you saw nothing? - Peter's here! - No. And heard nothing? No, sorry. If you recall something. Yes, of course. Let me walk you out. - Have fun. - Thank you. XENIA: PLEASE CALL ME? WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING? OKAY, JUST FORGET IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS... - What is it? - What? You seem, uh... That was the night that I, um, ended it with Xenia. I didn't want to tell them. Then they'd have to question her as well. You were with her? Yeah, I stopped by quickly and came back. I told you. I thought you called her from the car. We're headed out now. Wait! We have to sing the "thank you, parents" song! Come on! ♪ Thanks to the parents ♪ ♪ Thanks to Johan and beer ♪ ♪ We're going out to drink We're going out to drink ♪ ♪ We'll puke in every single hedge ♪ ♪ And drink until we fall down ♪ ♪ Behind the monoliths ♪ ♪ Behind the monoliths ♪ WE LOVE YOU WE MISS YOU WE LOVE YOU MOM IN HEAVEN Yes. Yes. Fine. Thank you. Yes, I understand. I understand. But I have to get your name first. I would like to turn myself... Can't you see I'm busy? You'll need to wait. You can sit. Yes, I'm back now. And what did you say the time was? Do you have any idea? Yes. Okay. But we... Yes. But if we write between 9:30 and 11:00, that should be... Yes. Good. JOHAN: FUCKING GREAT PARTY, DAD. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. The story is still unfolding, but police are currently working to get to the bottom of what really happened. The police hunting for the perpetrator behind the tragic accident at Funen centers around a white work van, which witnesses believe could have Romanian plates. The police fear that the perpetrator has fled the country. If you have any information to aid the police in their search, please contact the Funen police department. In other news, midsummer is approaching... And now, the government and its supporters have agreed... CAR WASH I never understood why Leonora started to suspect Christian. But somehow, she had figured it out. You recall selling me this card? - You're the mathematician. - Yes. I put on 200 kroner, and got a gold wash for 79. So there should be 121 kroner left, and there isn't. You used the card twice. No, I didn't. First on the 15th at 9:27 a.m., and the second time was the 17th at 10:18 p.m. On Wednesday? Johan? Christian? Will you come up? Where's Johan? Uh... Outside. With Martha. - Okay, I have to talk to... - I went to wash the car today. I couldn't believe how fast you made a mess of it. And I couldn't get why the wash card had no money left. I said the card hadn't been used Wednesday evening. And you know? I was so annoying that the clerk found the surveillance video for me. He sent me a file. Come look. I would have been killed. It would've been me. We have to go pick something up over at... What's going on? You look like... Look... We have to talk. Can you wait outside? Is it the doctor? Is it something with me? No, no, no. Hey. I just have to talk to her. - Go ahead. - Are you gonna divorce? Mom? Are you okay? Hey... What's goin' on? - Hi, Martha. - Hey. Come on. Don't... Don't come near me. The neighbor's in the garden. - I'll scream. - No, Leonora. I'm not a... - Please just relax. - Really? Relax? You... You tried to kill me, Christian. - No. I just... - You... - You have murdered an innocent woman. - No. No, I... I'm calling the police! Wait... I... Will you... Can we just talk about it? Can't we just... Can't you wait a bit? I couldn't... Please wait... - Hello? - Wait a minute. Can we just... I'll... It's Leonora Holm. Yesterday you were at our house. - Can I just speak... Can we... - About the woman who was hit. - We need to talk. Please just wait. - Yes. Yes, at number 23. Yes, hi. My wife thought we should call. I did, uh, see a vehicle. Yes, it was foreign. Romanian, I think. Sorry. Can I please call you back? Wait. Wait. - Give me my phone. - I can't hear you. - I need my cell phone! - I can't hear you. I can't... Here. Here. Can we go inside? Please. I... I'm not going in there with you! Leonora. Calm down. You have... - Can we... - You! Ugh! Sorry, sorry. Shhh, shhh. Think about Johan. Did you think about Johan when you did that? That he would live without his mother? You have called Leonora. Leave a message. Fuck! Dad, what is it? - Dad... - Shhh. I love you. You know that? You know that, right? But what's wrong? Hey, can you do me a favor? What? Go wait in your room. Why? Who's at the door? Please just do it. Do as I say, okay? Come on. Can we come in? Can we do this outside? My son's upstairs. If we could spare him. Well, your wife called us. Yeah. You say it had foreign plates? The car. Yeah, well, I... I, uh, did notice it out of the corner of my eye. There have been so many burglaries, so we look out for vans that are foreign. Where was it from? The car. I'm not sure, but I think it was Romanian. Why did you think it was Romania? The license plate. MEET ME AT L'EPUISETTE AT 9 P.M. What's on a Romanian plate? "RO." It says "RO." Now, I know what you're thinking. He was practically glowing with guilt. But I needed the most important thing. The evidence. You understand why we're meeting here? I've done a lot of thinking in the last few hours. I've tried to weigh each of your crimes on... What're they called? The scales of justice. There's no doubt those three motherless children deserve for you to be in jail for life. - Yes. - But I'm no judge. I am, firstly, Johan's mother. And he's the only good thing I've done. I sacrificed everything so he could thrive. And if you go to jail, convicted of fraud and murder, well, all will be lost. But I have another problem. My life will always be at risk. What? You tried to kill me once, and you'll try it again. No, no. No, I won't. No. I'm not a... I would give everything to change what I did. Leonora, what can I do? You do to her what you were going to do to me. Xenia. As long as she's out there, my life's at risk. Because I'm a threat. To you. Sorry, I need to understand what you're saying. You want me to... You're saying that I should... Stop it, Leonora. I must've been completely out of my mind at that moment. Do you understand? - You had threatened to report me, I mean... - I would never have reported you. I couldn't give you up and be the loser. Not to her. I promise... I'll never lay a hand on you. All I can think of is Johan. Protecting him. And that can only happen if you do to her what you would've done to me. Then we'll share the burden. And it'll be our project. Before, it was your project. To get rid of me. And now we get rid of the threat to us. I'll be your accomplice. Because I know. - It'll be our secret. - Hey, stop. Now. Just stop. Would you stop that? What are you saying? Have you gone completely insane? I'm not gonna... Think about Johan. That would just increase the chances of me being found out. And everything would affect Johan. He'd lose us both, and that would ruin his life completely. You're making no sense. Okay. Wait. Stop it. Leonora, it makes no sense what you're saying. Should have thought of that before you tried to kill his mother. Besides, it's only a matter of planning. You're good at it, as it turns out. You need an alibi. I had one that night. The night that Mike fell off the ledge. I knew he was cheating. I could feel it. There he was. Right by the edge. He didn't look scared. He just looked... surprised. Hey, there... I'm about to lock up for the night. Will you close the windows before you go? Ah, but you're sort of guessing again, aren't you? Am I? Remember, Leonora's teacher had heard her all evening. But she hadn't actually seen her. Sound as an alibi. Voilà. You have our King Suite. It's our finest room. - This is gorgeous. - Yes. - Well, if that's all. - How long is the spa open? Until 10:30 p.m., so you have plenty of time. - Thank you. - Yep. Under control? It's vital no one sees you leave here. - And Christian? - Yes. The timing. Of the text. It should look like a burglary. You can do this, honey. You've done it before. Right? This is lovely. It's just what we need. It's time. ♪ 'Cause baby you said... ♪ - Hey, can I come in? - Go away. Xenia. I won't do this anymore. You disappeared. This is over. My only son just graduated. Leonora had a total breakdown. Give me a chance. Dream on, Christian. I'm not your toy. - Go away. - Just wait. What the fuck are you doing? Are you insane? Let go! I love you. Xenia? More than I ever loved anyone. Xenia, are you okay? Hi, Xenia. I thought I heard glass breaking. No. It's nothing. I, um... I'm clumsy. - Okay. Good night. - Good night then. Yes, it's us in the King Suite. We decided we'd like to have dinner in our room. Sounds good. We'd like the shrimp for starters. Oh, wait. My husband's calling from the bathroom. He changed his mind, and we'll get the gazpacho to start. Where the hell have you been? A lot has happened. Can I have a glass? What do you want? Whatever you're having. DEAR XENIA I CAN'T DO IT. I'M SORRY. MY FAMILY IS EVERYTHING TO ME. Come in. It's room service. Wow, so quick! Time to get out, Christian. Our dinner's here. - And we just need this. - Yeah. - Thanks a lot. - I'll just get the tip. Just a minute. Christian? I need to tip the waiter. I think there's some money in my pants. The gray ones. They're on the bed. Okay. It's not necessary. - I have it right here. - Well... Thanks very much. Enjoy. I could feel you. Looking at me. You're the most beautiful thing ever. Xenia? Are you okay? Hey. You okay, Xenia? I knew you couldn't do it. - Hi. - Hello. The entire place was suspiciously clean of DNA and fingerprints, and the bedsheets had just been changed. Her computer, wallet, and cellphone were gone as well. But we got a warrant, and we gained access to her last messages. Wanna know what they said? "Dear Xenia." "I'm sorry." "I can't do this." "My family means everything to me." Sounds like a man with cold feet. Was it him? Christian Holm. Leonora. I'm glad you're home, honey. If you don't know what to say, let me do the talking. Come on. You're seeing us a whole bunch lately. How can we help? Christian, we're here concerning a woman with whom you work. Xenia Mikkelsen. Maybe it's best if we talk in private? No, it's okay. There was a burglary at her weekend house. One of the neighbors heard something suspicious. And now there's no trace of her, so we sent out a missing person's report. And we're looking into who she's been in contact with. I'm afraid I don't know about that. But you talked the other night? On Sunday? Yeah. I broke up with her. We had an affair. Oh. For how long? A little more than a year. We've been together for over 20 years, and our son has been very ill. They've been hard years. We've both taken other lovers. It's only natural in a long marriage to have ups and downs. Not sure if you understand. Are you married? Yeah. Yeah. My wife died last year. So you wrote to Xenia late Sunday night. Where were you? We were at a spa. In Kongebrogården. You're more than welcome to check. Hmm. Yes. What do you think? Is she alive? Well, folks have turned up after 20 days. And also after 20 years. But is she alive? - No. - No. But why take the body, if it's a burglary and a murder. - It could incriminate the perp. - Mm-hmm. Or if they'd just had sex. Check all the small ports on the coast. Already on it. If there's a corpse, we'll find it. And have the dog patrols comb the woods. They're gone. We're doing this. As a team. For Johan. And for us. What'd they do with it? Exactly. What the hell'd they do with it? How far are we from the lake? It's a kilometer that way. Long way to drag a body. We would have found tracks. Okay, we'll split up. You go toward the road, and we'll go toward the lake. And then he goes down there and lights it up. It's gonna be awesome. Well, I can't wait to see. Your dad looks like he knows what's up. There are police dogs. They're looking for that missing woman. Is it time? Hell no. It's only eight. It's too soon. - They promised rain, so... - Yeah, later. Oh, no, no. I mean, yes. We could stay here if you want. I think you should light it. Hey! What are you doing? You're not gettin' all the glory for yourself. I want to light it before the rain comes. Yeah, okay. Fine. Well, Christian wants us to light the bonfire now, so... Yeah! Woo! Cheers, Dad. - So here we go. - He made it with Kim. Easy. Let's go to the shore. - Hand me the gas? - Sure. Damn, it stinks out here. Did we trap some hedgehogs in there? Looking good. The other one. Easy now. We'll search on the shore. You got a lighter? No. Can't you just strike more of them at once? Let's move on. Holger, this is a false trail. ♪ We love our country ♪ ♪ When the blessed Christmas lights ♪ ♪ The star in the tree With a sparkle in every eye ♪ ♪ When in spring every bird ♪ ♪ Over field, under beach ♪ ♪ Bends its voice to a welcoming warble ♪ ♪ Your word is our song Across each road, across each street ♪ ♪ Your name is our garland When the harvest is gathered... ♪ - Excuse me. Can I take a look? - Yes, of course. But Dad, even if you burn a body, you're still left with the bones. They only burn at 1,200 degrees. Right. But you can hide those. The rest is gone. That's it. Nothing left. Hey. It's time. Finally. It was something about the boat from Sealand. And you? Are you ready? Yes. My dad spent this entire time trying to talk me out of it. You're such a romantic, Dad. Hey, I'm a realist. People think that getting married is where happiness begins. I'm just saying it's not always true. Maybe, but a lot can happen. You just have to remember you could easily be walking into the arms of your future worst enemy. You... - How do I look? - My dear... You're the most beautiful woman, and no one deserves you. Come on, haven't you been listening? I'm saying that love is far more dangerous than its reputation. Now anything can happen. Are you ready for that? Yeah. Uh-huh.
