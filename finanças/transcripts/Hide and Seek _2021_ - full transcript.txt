Ah, I lost you again, sorry. This fucking area. Uh-huh. No, no, no, they said they had a place to move me. I'll kick you in your fucking teeth, I swear to God. Frankie, it's fine, it's fine. I'm walking away from him right now. I'm not moving home. I have a life here, Ma! Well, maybe I shouldn't tell ya nothing, huh? Ma. I... Dad, I'll call you back, hmm? This fucking guy. What kind of life can you have there? We all have to move anyway. They're tearing the place down. I met someone. They're gonna get me outta here. He helped me move in, fix my room up. He's an artist. He has dreams, Mom. Wait, just hold... Just hold on. I gotta go, Mom. Ah, my fucking cash! I know you've been in here, you asshole! I'm gonna call the cops, I swear to God. I got you this time. Hello? My God. Where's your mother, hmm? It's past your bedtime. Go, go. Where's your mother, hmm? It's past your bedtime. Go, go. Max, not at the table with that, please. Miss, you too. I'll call you back. How's the rehearsal going, honey? He sounds cheesy. I like it. Keep going. I wanna hear it. "They came from all walks of life and earned their right to be here, in the beacon of hope." Your dad's line? It's fine. He was a smart man. Oh, honey, that's dangerous. Don't talk about your dad. Talk about what you're doing to change the business. I was hoping to avoid talking about him by offering them a bite. But no one wants just a bite. You're pandering. Stay away from conflating the issues. Ooh. Lawyer me hard. - Ew! - Gross! You're gonna sound stiff, honey. You're already stiff. Lose the cards, stick to the building, and don't answer questions for her. Hello? Has anyone seen the link? They're making us write a report on agriculture. - Oh. - Which is boring, so Damian is coming over. - Your boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. He's my study partner. Listen, I studied agriculture in college, so I'm happy to help if I can. - No, you'll just try and take it all over. - I won't. Besides, you didn't even look at the link. I'm sorry. I don't live inside a USB port. Just tell me in human form so I can understand it. That didn't even make sense, Mom. Ha! Boyfriend! He's not my boyfriend. None of your business! Stop! Honey, the plane. I asked nicely. Go, get ready for school. We're gonna be late. They're savages. They take after their mother. What time is the interview? 9:00. Hannah? Sweetie, let's go! - Just a second! - Max, come here. "Chaos is the law of nature..." "But order is the way of man." Good boy. - See ya later! - See ya. Oh, Max has a short day today, remember? Yeah, yeah. Hey. Stick to the building. Don't let her pull you in. - Right. - Love you. Oh, the cleaning ladies come at 10:00 today, so please leave these, they'll do it. That's the plight of the converted pre-war hotel. This was the last full purchase made before my father passed. We remodeled and updated the interior design to give it a more modern feel while maintaining the original aspects of the hotel. Slow down or I'm gonna take my heels off. The draw of it all is very alluring, but since his passing, I wonder, are you gonna continue to carry out your father's business model? It's very challenging to take over someone else's vision. Yeah, well, he was a challenging man. He lobbied to divest the poorest neighborhoods in the city. I mean, even this building that you're touting here, middle-income property gutted of its residency, its history... Oh, come on now, Betsy. I assume this interview isn't going to be a moral lecture. I'm sorry for your loss, but with all due respect, you're not the legitimate heir here, which begs some questions of family lineage. Two brothers, one with the keys to the kingdom, and the other, disregarded? No, my brother was never part of the company. And he ends up with an Order of Protection slapped on him from the estate? Noah, look, you have an opportunity here to find a more compassionate angle, to right some past wrongs, to set a better tone for your future. Wouldn't you like that? It's tricky. If I answer yes, then it's an admittance. And if you don't answer, you're affirming a broken legacy. I'll let you sit on that, but I need an answer for the article. - My bad. - Ooh, Jesus. So sorry. Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Uh... Write me this weekend? Yeah. Fuck. What? It's tough to decide whether to tell you or not, since I don't want your nose in any of this. When your father died, we got a call from your brother about the estate. Turns out he's living in some derelict building down in Queens. Then I sent my guy down to have a peek. He snapped these. It's Jacob, all right. - He's here? New York? - Now, we're not sure. The manager is complaining about some girl gone missing and your brother couldn't make the rent. They need to get his stuff out. Maybe he ran off with the gal, or worse. Bottom line is, keep your distance. Sweet? No. Margie tells me it's way better than smoking, but she never smoked. You got an address? Do not crawl down that rabbit hole. The press has got their nose on this already. They called for pictures. I-I gotta play some serious chess here. Look, I could have a couple of cops... No, no, no cops. That's the last thing he needs. Noah, you gotta think about your family, your kids. Some people just get lost. Hello. - Mine! - Hey! Wait! Hey! Can I get my phone back? Hey! We playing a game? - Come back! - Gimme that! - Get off of me right now! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, calm down. It's just a little girl... Ah! Fuck! Mom! You bad man, let go of my child! - Come. - Goddamn it, shut that shit up! Lue, you... Where's your brother? Why aren't you looking after the door? We were. Hey, come on. I'm trying to take a bath and medi-fucking-tate. I gotta listen to Oscar the Grouch piss himself? Take him to the back alley. Don't need no damn cops in here. And clean this place up, or I'ma turn your hot water off for the day! - Fuck off, Frankie. You can't do that. - I can and I will, princess. - Bullshit, man. - You got anything to do with this? No, just looking for someone. - Excuse me. - Thank you. We gotta get you cleaned up. You're dripping blood on my floor! I help you. Come with me. ♪ London Bridge Is falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down, falling down ♪ ♪ London Bridge Is falling down ♪ ♪ My fair lady ♪ I can sing and play songs! Push my buttons! Your brother hasn't made rent in a while. I gotta get paid, or you can get all his shit outta there by tomorrow. I'll settle up with you now. Oh, be careful with your arm. Oh, no, I'm fine. That's not necessary. Let her do it. She's the old lady's caretaker. Go ahead, let her feel useful. Yeah, she's been here for years. From back when this place used to be a fancy-ass hotel. This whole area fell apart. Now she the last one standing. Survivor right there, made it through wars, hid in basements and attics and shit. Just to get here. Where she gonna go now, huh? Y'all hurry this shit up. I got stuff to do, you hear? What's your name? My name's Mi Jin. What's your name? My name is Noah. Look at this watch. It's, uh, shiny. Mi Jin, see how fancy. It's a family heirloom. It's not that fancy. You must have a very big house, a big car. My place is, uh, more small than even this one and not so clean. Her eye, it cannot get better here. But we are learning to survive. Do you know when they take this building from us? The notice didn't say exactly, but it's only a matter of time. I will find her a beautiful place, away from all this. Anything for my Mi Jin. Mine! Give her back to her, please. I'm looking for someone. A neighbor. There are no neighbors. Only drifters. They come, they stay, those who do, drift away. My brother, he was in apartment 2A. Have you seen him? Freak! Keep him away from my daughter! He should never have been allowed in here. Go! Out! Now! Out! Now! - You know what all that was about? - Ah, that's just stress, man. Everyone's in a tizzy trying to figure out where they gonna go. I got a girl gone missing right next to your brother's room. Hey, how'd he end up in this place while his big hunky-hunk brother travels in a suit that could pay all these fuckers' rent? Different life paths. I had a brother. Got into race cars. Built 'em, the whole thing. I thought he'd made the better play in life, till he crashed and broke his neck in four places. Pisses out a tube now. Anyway, "different life paths," that's poetic. Here's our stop. Don't bother, don't bother. As you can see by the exquisite mural I've created, he ain't here. I'ma leave you two alone. You let me know if he dead in there. - Thank you. - Hmm. - Seventeen... - Come find me! ...18, 19, 20! Ready or not, here I come! This is your fault. This is because you spoil them. You brought that fucking woman into this house! - Don't you ever... - You're responsible for this! Oh, he is lashing out because his father has left him behind. I haven't left anyone behind. You've chosen your son to groom. - Hello? - Where are you? Max called, saying you weren't there. I'm heading there at 4:00. No, it's his half day. We talked about this already. - Okay. I'll go there now. - I'm already here. No, I'll see you at home. Where are you anyway? Hello? Hello? Wait, hey! Hey! Jacob! Hey! Wait! Stop! Fuck. Jacob! First, agricultural revolution... Here you go, kiddos. - Thanks. - Just gonna get you something to drink. - Honey? You gonna put Max to bed? - Uh-huh? Yes, I'm just finishing up some work. Can you tell Hannah to wrap it up? Already did, she's walking him down. What is it, a date? My mom won't let me do anything past, like, 8:00 at night. - That's a bummer. - Yeah. Bummer. Plus, my dad, he's... Well, he's kind of a freak. What? Your dad seems cool. My dad seems like a lot of things. He's just... My grandpa died. Now my dad's in charge of everything, it's kind of a big deal. - Anyway, it's weird. - Parents are weird, dude. They say one thing but want something else. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Did you just call me "dude"? I don't know. Shit, man, watch out. Oh, Jacob. Max! Did you wash up? You should be in bed. I was waiting on you. I'm testing the wing! Yeah, you're tracking water all over the house. Okay. Sorry. Good night, Max. Bed. Land. Five minutes, sweetie. How's the hand? Fine. Dumb luck. Are you considering a new build? No, no. Just, um... Just a curiosity. Municipal disinvestment. Interesting structure, they want to change it into stores, I'm just looking to see if I... Can save it? No. It's probably too far gone for that. What? I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. I didn't sleep last night. I know you didn't. I know everything. - Do you? - Mm-hmm. Nothing slips past me. You see... I think you just need to relax. Remind yourself that you made these changes for a reason. Right. Move this paper. - What's wrong? - Shh. What is that? Can you hear it? What? You don't hear that? - What are you doing? - Shh. I'm going downstairs. Honey? Max? Jacob. Car's here! You're taking the kids? Yeah, did you want to take... No. - Mom! - Okay. Honey? Did you see my blue coat in the car? Mom, let's go! - Mom! - Coming! It's just a dead bird. Don't make connections where there aren't any. Then why's he back in New York? My guess is, Jacob got a sniff off of some five-and-dime ambulance chaser. Lawyer put stars in his eyes, promised him part of the company after the old man died. I don't see why not. Jacob has a claim to some of it. Well, I wrote that will. It's bulletproof. Your father's choice was clear. He wanted order and loyalty. That's what you gave him. Hey, Noah, let's drop you off at the store? I'll run down to the slip this time. No. It has to be me. Yuri, pull over. Samantha uses a bird store around the corner on York. Catch a cab back. So, now I'm an errand boy. Yo, listen. We're gonna find her. Maybe she went to her mom's house for a couple of days. You don't know. Listen up! Pool's open! It's okay. It's okay. Pool's open! Hey! Pool's open! One triangle? Is that Gina's room? Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to this bozo. - That one? - Oh, yeah. Four men. One woman, one man. Back so soon? Why'd you clean out my brother's apartment? Told you, gotta rent it. And I told you I'd cover it. Sorry, promises from guys like you usually come with a needle and thread. Hey, hey, wait! Pool's open! Why were you in his room? Girl goes missing, people gonna ask why. - Who, the cops? - Are you crazy? Last time we had cops in here was because somebody died in 2G. Took 'em three days to get here. Like they were waiting on a fucking resurrection. Who cleaned out his room? The twins, man. They swept the place last night. Take the shit, put it back into circulation for anyone who needs it. That's the way it works around here. Big fuckin' barter system, huh? Place is only half occupied by tenants. The twins fill the empties, we cut up everything that comes in. Anything that'll get us through, till it all crumbles down around us. I need to know where my brother's stuff is. Down at the old pool to be divvied up amongst the faithful. He was in Gina's apartment. I saw him. They got a system. Run it like a swap meet. - Shit comes in, shit goes out. - It's him. Everybody gotta make do around here. Vroom, vroom. Hey. Hi. Do you remember me? You do? Good. You remember this? Yes. You can have it. Mine. I'll give it to you if you tell me where my brother is. He's hiding. He's hiding. Where is he hiding? Inside. Hey! Yo! That's a wrap, my friends. All right, guys, move on. Closing shop here. You want it? Come on. Move, move, move over. Inside where? - Stay away from her. You want to hurt us? - Mine! I don't wanna hurt anybody. They're covering his tracks. Why? He was trying to take from us. Like you. Always where he is not belonging. What about the girl? The neighbor in 2B. Did you see them together? Hey! You know something, and you're not telling me. You should never have come back here. Come on, come on, come on. - Ado, relax! - Can't stop me! Mom, I'm just not having fun. - Thanks. - Aren't I supposed to be having fun? It wasn't the game, honey. It's the level of players. I think I'm going to put you back in intramural. - What do you say? - I don't want to play, though. Ugh. I hate soccer. Yeah, but your dad played and, you know, you're following the same path, I guess. Well, does he play now? No, you're probably already way more coordinated than he is. What floor? What, Mom? Geez. Breeding of animals follows the same basic principles of the pollination of a plant. As fertilization leads way to growing... Hannah? - Can you please look after your brother? - Why? I have to grab something from the lobby. Max! Turn that off, weirdo. That's my... Max. Hey, look at me. Keep the door locked no matter what, okay? - Why? - Because I said so. Oh, God, where the hell is your father? My friend. My friend! We have found ourselves in a predicament, haven't we? My brother, he's not too expressive in the verbal realm. He paints his feelings. Twin got this image stuck in his head. He paints the chaos, the violence, the suffering. We have more in common than you know, suit. We both have someone we lost. I just wanna get out of this fucking mess. And you can be. I don't want you here. I'm just trying to keep him calm, but I'm gonna need your help. I wanna help. Where is she? Gina. My brother's girl. What'd you do to her? What girl? You were in the apartment, yes? No, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait... Wait! Hannah! This process matured over time. And as the mammalian species... Hannah, get the door! ...upright genus Homo, Homo habilis, evolving around 2.8 million years ago. The creation of centralized administration between the more densely populated... - Hannah! - I'm in the bathroom, lazy ass. - Hannah? - What? God! Should we call Mom? Is this Damian trying to be funny? I don't know. Who is it? Okay! Her door was open. I went into her room. Is that it? That's everything. I believe you. I just don't know if he will. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay, okay! I followed a path. - Hey, I have a package. - Sure thing. Is my husband down here? I can't get a hold of him. Let me just call him. Hang on. Call Mom. Maybe it's a package. Leave it at the door! Go, go, go, go! Here's your package, Sam. He says it's in the closet. Check the closet. Fuckin' creep! You knew about this? You were hiding him, huh? Max? Hannah? We're in here! We're in here! - We're clear. - Go. Go ahead. Hello? Hey! Hey! Wait! Hold on! Stop! Wait! Sorry, sorry. Geez, sorry, sorry, ma'am. Noah! Noah! Hey, what happened? Oh, my God, what happened? - Noah, look at me. - He walked in like this. You all right? - Give me your hand. - The kids, where are they? There was an incident, but they're fine. Don't worry about it. Mr. Blackwell, are you okay? It's Jacob. It's him. Here! Easy! - Here! - What's he after? Something in him just broke back then. He's been trying to fix it ever since. You know, his dad's death brought it all back again. Brought what back? Whatever he saw, the memories of his mom. It's like this tiny dose of poison. Doesn't kill him, but just keeps gnawing away at him until there's nothing left. - You gonna be all right? - Yeah. I'm okay. I'll be out in the hall. If you need me, I'll stay here tonight. Thank you. Please check on the kids. They're downstairs with Lyle. Okay. It's Jacob. Noah? Come on, let's go to bed. No! I know. I know it's him, Sam. He's fucking with my head. He wants what's mine, what's his. I saw him. I saw the symbols. He tracks all the people inside. He's inside their homes, watching them. Sweetie, Jacob is unwell. He is not your responsibility anymore! That is over, honey. He wants this. He wants you, he wants the kids, he wants my life! The kids, they love their dad. We have to get back there. Come on, come on. You have to get back for your kids. - Shh. - Come back to me. - Shh! They know he's here. - These thoughts, they're not new thoughts. - Noah, talk to yourself. - They know he's here. They're not new thoughts! Stop it! Look at me! Have you seen him? Have you seen his face? Jacob? Sweetie, shh, just close the door. Just close it. That's it. That's it. Just close the door. Shh. Why don't we go to Vermont? We just spend the week up there. Maybe my parents can come help. Listen, we don't need to sort this out tonight. You need to rest. I'm just gonna go check on the kids, okay? You were in my fucking house! Attacked my fucking family! - Jacob! - Who the fuck is Jacob? - Who's Jacob? - Come here. Who the fuck is Jacob? - Oh, fuck. - What did I do? They just gave me this room. Get out of here. Go. Move! Help. Help! Help! Help! Inside, now! - He's in there. - Lue! Open the door! Open up, let me in! Where the fuck is he? Hey! Get away from her! Wait! - Okay, go pick some snacks. - Can I get? We are moving today. It has been very hard on my daughter. She has not been well since we lost our home. How can she heal when she cannot feel safe? There is a saying in my country... This means, "That place is our bird's nest." She's my little bird. Our old home... they force us out. Take our place and give to other people. How can they do this? Greed. Yes, greed. We have to be strong, make a sacrifice. We have to do this to make good life for our children. Oh, uh... it is time for us to be going now. Thank you. You are kind. - Your eye, it's feeling okay? - It's okay. Now we have a new house, you will get much better. Mommy, can I have the big room this time? Anything you want. It should be ready by now. So, they're packing. I'm gonna want someone at every exit while we escort them out, okay? Whoa. What the hell was that? Okay, Meyers, clear the north stairwell. Let's go check the tapes, get officers down here, quietly. It's okay. I can sing and play songs! Push my buttons! Mi Jin? Where's your mommy? Do you wanna come inside? Play? Our new home... all mine. Yours. More toys? Toys, yes. Lots of toys. ♪ London Bridge Is falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down, falling down ♪ ♪ London bridge Is falling down ♪ ♪ My fair lady ♪ Sing with me! One, two, three! One, two... Oh, toys. Max? Excuse me, have you seen my daughter? Why are you in her room? Huh? You're not hiding her, no? You're not hurting her! Please! - Don't hurt my daughter! - Mom? Mom! Very bad boy. - Hey! Let him go! - Help! Give her back to me! - You let him go! - You should be gone! This is our home. Just let him go! Sweetie, look at me. - You're gonna be okay. - Mom, help! Max! Go! Go! Run, kids, run! - Get out of here! - Go, go, go! My child! You took my home! Hopefully, he'll find the peace that eluded him in life. Aren't you kids cold? I am. That was nice. Yeah. Someone had to do it. Yeah, but... it was still difficult. Thank you for all you did today. Can we go inside? Yeah, honey. Don't track mud inside the house, please, both of you. I know. You know, Sam, I shouldn't have obsessed with all of this all these years, and led your husband down a path that... Don't do that. Don't blame yourself for this. Oh, let me, please. So much easier that way. How's Margie doing? She says I'm getting fat. Gotta give up the sugar and the cigarettes. Oh, no. Can't win, Sam. She was surprised, you deciding to give up the place. Couldn't have survived there. All right, I've taken up enough of your time. Never. Oh. Oh, almost forgot. For your scrapbook. Did the tenants stay? Uh-huh. We worked out a way to keep 'em there. Turns out the whole block was zoned residential, rent stabilized. Just had to coerce the city to hold to its standards. Your husband fought for those people. We'll go white around the wheels to offset the base. It'll look nice. The family relocated just after this beautiful penthouse was built. Didn't really have time to live in it. It's virtually brand-new. And if you follow me back here, wait till you see the rest of the unit. You'll see it has three bedrooms down here, one downstairs, along with spacious bathrooms on all floors. And you'll find the master in the back with its own balcony overlooking the beautiful skyline of New York City. - Look at that view! - Oh. Mine.
