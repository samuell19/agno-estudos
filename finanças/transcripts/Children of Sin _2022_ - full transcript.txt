Friends we're in the middle of a war. This is a war between good God-fearing folks like you and I, and those on the side of Satan. You know, just last week, I was with my children, my young children out of the moon trying to have a nice time with my family. And I look over to the concession line. You and there are two men holding hands. Two men, mind you just carrying on like a normal couple. Like, there's nothing wrong with it. Bunch of sickos. Now I ask you, should we let these people run around and do what they want? Should we let these people get to us and get to a our children? Because that's what they'll do. - They'll stop... - Jackson. On nothing to take us down with... Where's that sister your? They'll stop nothing to infect us with their sin. Folks, it is up to us to make sure that our children are not practicing sin. Our very livelihood depends on this. Is there some reason that she's not down here with the rest of the family. Hanging on us, if we raise a bunch of sinners. She may not be feeling well. Defy His rules and commands... I'll go check on her. No, do you think we'll despair the fires of hell? No. I say if we wanna taste that sweet promise of heaven, we'll have to make a few sacrifices along the way. Amen. Hey. Sweetie, are you okay? Well, Robbie's about to fire up the grill. Are you hungry? I'll be down in a minute. Okay? You didn't have to gimme these ma? Well, it's not every day that your son makes the honor roll. We are so proud of you. Robbie. You not to give me this. You just got me that fishing pole last week. Hey, forget about this Robbie business. It's gonna be dad by next Sunday. Might as well start getting used to it. You too, Emma. Your brother tells me that you were out with some colorful characters last night. Are you still running around with that Rachel McKenny? I hear she's a bit of a loose girl, big into drugs, lots of boyfriends and that mother. So what? I like her. I don't know if your mother allows that kind of talk at their dinner table, but that's not something that's gonna be happening in this house. Do you understand? She's sorry. You're sorry, aren't you Emma? I'm sorry, sir. You know what this family needs, is a celebration. I'm gonna go cut the cake. So Jackson, maybe you should start tutoring your sister, whatever teachers called last week and her grades are slipping. You know what, I think I'll go help mom in the kitchen. That apartment we were looking at last year in Madison is for rent again. I saw it last night when I drove by it with Rachel. I don't think Robbie's looking to move anytime soon. No, I'm meant just a place for us to go. Just you, me and Jackson. Sweetie, what is it with the two of you? I thought you liked him. It's just... I just think you could do better. Sweetie. Robby takes care of me, of us. We don't have to worry about when we're going to eat or where we're going to sleep at night. And I mean, it's not like there are hundreds of men wanting to marry a woman my age with two kids, you know? He's just so... Okay, Emma, I am not going to have this conversation with you. We are lucky that Robby walked into our lives because without him, we wouldn't have the church and with the church, we will always have a family. We already had a family, mom. You know what? Why don't you finish slicing and I'll serve. Hi, sweetie. Do you have any trash? No, I'm good. Okay. When were you gonna tell me about this? I was just trying to figure out a plan. I'm gonna have to tell Robbie. No, please don't. I've been doing some research on how much abortion costs. You wanna kill your baby? Come on mom. It's not like you didn't have a couple of your own back in the day. Why can't you just be more like your brother, Emma? Just drama free. Give me that cell phone. You will not be getting this back for at least a week. Now, go brush your teeth. Because besides meals, you aren't leaving this bedroom. Or we can lock. Slot for a daughter. We've gotta do something about this. What did you do now? They always fight after you've done something. Why are you giving him such a hard time? Why do you like him so much? He comes to my football games. Buys me new shoes helps me with my homework. Yeah, but haven't you noticed how mom's changed since she met him? I mean, come on. She wasn't exactly cooking us home cooked meals and going to Bible retreats. We were lucky to get a soggy bag of McDonald's at the end of the day. Well, before we went to go live with Grammy and all this religious stuff. Is there something wrong with being religious? Grammy was, your dad was, maybe mom was too. You know, for some reason, I don't think mom stuck around long enough to find out what their favorite Bible verses were. You don't think it's cool having a dad around? Someone who will be there for our graduations or weddings. Awful, wedding. Are you in that cute guy from the speech and debate team still talking? That's gross. Why, I thought you two were cute together. You still talk to him. Why would I do that? That's a sin. Come on. You know, Jackson, You used to laugh a lot more before Robbie was around. Be nice to hear you laugh again. Come on, Jackson. You used to always be on my side. Why can't you be on my side here? Because being on your side always seems to get me into trouble. That's really big. They caught this right by that cabin that we're going to tomorrow. Mm. I'm gonna go show this to Jackson. And I think he'd get a big kick out of it. Hubby! What is that? It's a. I thought I was the only one here. Oh, I was just looking for some Advil. I'll leave you with alone. Jackson. Do you know that? What you did is wrong? Boys like that God doesn't love them. What are you doing outta your room? I was just trying to get some water. What's going on. Last night, we... Robbie found your brother engaging an adult conversation with another boy. So what he likes boys. What's the big deal. Come on mom. I got, that was a given after he was Cinderella for Halloween in second grade. Do you think your brother's eternal damnation is funny? Do you think it's something to laugh about? Just because you're going to hell. Doesn't mean you're gonna take the rest of us with you. Robbie, stop it. You didn't discipline these kids enough. That's what's wrong with me. So are we eating before fishing or are we stopping to get something on the... Where would we go? What would I do for a living? I could try to get my job back at that olive garden. Now I don't think I'm allowed within 500 feet of that place. You figure out later, as long as we're a wait from him, look, we could just get in the car and drive anywhere. I don't care if we have to sleep in the cardboard box. It means that much to you. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry that you kids got stuck with the big old dope, like me for your mom. You'd be so much better off without me. Mom. Don't say that. Tammy, are you making lunch? Yes. Yeah, I'll be there in a second. Hey, listen. We'll figure it out later, okay? Let's just go eat. Remember what I said, little girl? One word. Don't want anything to happen. Do we? Hmm. It's, time to wake up, sweetie. Where are we going? We've got the whole place to ourselves. Not that all the boys at school are wild about you. Don't you wanna know what to do when you meet the right boy? You don't wanna be embarrassed, do you? I know what boys, like, I can show you if you like. Well, you must be Emma. I'm Mary Esther. Welcome to Abraham house. Where's my mom. I'm right here, sweetie. I'll leave you three. Talk this over. Thank you. Mom, what is this place? You guys trust me, right? And you know that. I love you both so, so much. And we can't, we can't let you go to hell. Go to hell. It's okay, baby. We can fix this. We can fix this all together, okay? If you just do what you're supposed to do. What is it we be doing? You just have to listen to Mary Esther. She works for the church and she knows how things are done. Did he put you up to this? I called your school and I told him that we had a family emergency and nobody has to know about this. It can just be our secret in. There's nothing wrong with us, mom. What about you, Jackson? Do you think that you could be a good boy and you could mind all of the rules? Well, if it makes you happy. Maybe it'll work. And if Robbie thinks it'll work. Yeah. So what about you, Emma? Do you think you can be good? I don't wanna be here, mom. Okay. Okay. Well then let's go. Let's just get in the car and let's drive around until we run out of gas and then we can find a nice overpass that we can live under. Would you like that Jackson? Huh? Or you could just stay here for three days just until Friday. Just until I can save up enough that I can get us a place. You would just be the three of us, like it used to be, no Robbie. The choice is yours. Three days without algebra. Who could turn that down? Oh, baby. Oh. I'll Call. I promise I'll call. Okay. I'll call. We don't stand for any profanity in this house. No taking the Lord's name in bay. You only get three strikes, three strikes and no more than that. What happens after three strikes? Hi, you must be Emma and Jackson. My name's Hank. It's very nice to meet you. Wow, where have you been? Oh, Mason, the gardener. His, car broke down and I had to jump in my off. Mm, Emma, why don't you come with me? I have your uniform down the hall. Breakfast is at 8:00 AM sharp, every day. Come bring a gum shine and there's to be - Still more time. - no more one person in the bathroom at any given time. I'm gonna get you out of here. I promise. Rebecca. This is Emma. She and her brother Jackson have just joined us. I trust you'll show her the ropes, but don't you have breakfast to make? Been in the system since she was three years old, lost a kid, you know, bless her heart. Yeah. Let's get you into that uniform. So you're telling me, I acted out on my homosexual urges because I long for a father figure in my life. It's a classic story. So you see, your mother has been your only stable parental figure for most of your life. But I can change. Oh, I'd like to think so if you want it hard enough. Will Robbie stay if I change? That I do not know. But, I like to think he will. Jackson, I've been where you are. Okay, trust me. I believe in you. Hey, I believe in you too. Kris Jackson, Jackson, Kris. Kris, why don't you show Jackson where to go get breakfast? Oh, Good stuff. Good stuff. Just don't let Mary Esther see this. You know how she hates it when you bring this to the breakfast table. First time at one of these places. Yeah. This is my third. Nothing ever seems to stick. I tell my grandma all the time that she's just wasting the money they could go to giving her a comfy retirement. Here I am again. One sec. - Hey Joel. - Yeah. - Come meet the new guy. - Okay. Hey, good morning. Nice to meet you. Good morning. Nice to meet you too. If you can believe it, Joel is here voluntarily. Absolutely. You are gonna love it here. Hank and Mary Esther, they are just inspirational. Anyway, I'll see you at breakfast. Brr! Do you know why you and your brother are here, Emma? Honestly, no. You're here because your parents still believe there's hope for you. Okay, Robbie is not my dad. My dad died a long time ago. My father died too. When I was 12. I sometimes that's why I went down the road. I went down. I'd hate to see you go down that same road. The drinking, the drugs, the fornicating baby killing. Well, it wasn't until I joined the church, I realized I was worth saving. And I had a calling, I never even knew about. And I had someone who'd always be there by my side. Wouldn't it be nice to know there was someone there for you, someone who would always love you, no matter what. I'm good, honestly. Well, I thought I was a okay, too, until I wasn't. The church saved me and it can save you too. When I think of all the time I wasted sending the running away from Christ. Christ always finds you. He always knows. If you sinned. Keep these buttoned. Mustn't give the boys any ideas. Well, it's almost breakfast time. You better go help Rebecca set the table. I'll be there in a moment. Huh. ♪ Victory ♪ When you're cursed with the homosexual virus, it weighs down on you like this backpack. At everything you do, the way you think, talk has to be rewired. I know it sounds difficult, but I've done it. And you can too. And these days I never have a homosexual thought. Hey, can I take this off? Oh yeah. Yeah. Why don't we try some walking exercises. Rebecca, please don't burn the biscuits like you did yesterday. It may not seem like a big deal now, but your husband might not be a fan. Hey, don't take this the wrong way. But do you want me to help you with that? No, it's just Mary Esther doesn't like it. If there's too much good on the potatoes. Thanks. I mean, you can't really mess up butter biscuits. Just me a couple minutes and I'm sure I can find a way. So who were you talking to by the door earlier? My sister, Megan or foster sister. She's been in there for two days now. Why are you guys here? Because she kissed a girl and liked it. I was by four guys on the tennis team and wasn't even awake to enjoy it. Got this, well, baby out of it though. You too, huh? Yeah. Welcome to the home of unwed mothers and perverts. Wait, but who who's your baby daddy know? Was it some boyfriend or a rainbow? Our subject. I get it. Well, let me guess, you loved him. He knocked you up and broke your heart. Yeah, we'll go with that. So what did Megan do to get put in there? She used up ball, her strikes. Who knows what they make you do in there? I mean, I'm surprised he haven't shut this place down yet, but then again, I know more than a few cops who remembers themselves. Well, at least we're only here three days. Yeah. I mean, that's what they tell everybody, but it we're on day five. I've never seen anyone make it past day seven. What do you mean? Do they go home? Maybe. I mean, we never see anyone get picked up though. They just never show up for breakfast the next morning. Oh, now. Big bite. Are you ready to ask God for forgiveness? I didn't do anything wrong. Oh Megan, why do you lie to God? Now, before I can give you this bite, I'm going to need you ask God for forgiveness. Can you please untie me? Well, the Lord came to me last night. He told me to tell you he's done giving you chances if you don't ask for forgiveness. I didn't do anything wrong. You mean, you mean to tell me that if you were to die right now, you think you'd get into heaven. Well then let's test that theory. See anything yet? Any angels hear any trumpet? You know what, this could take a little while. There's still time to ask God for forgiveness. I don't know what you're smiling about. Especially considering where you are spending the rest of eternity. She wasn't always like this. Not until she joined the church and met Robbie. Same thing happened to my foster dad. I mean, he thought the church saved him for month and now he feels like he owes his life. And most of us savings to them. I mean, every month he sends a check to headquarters in Florida hoping to... I don't know, buy his way into heaven. I mean, I'm convinced that why they want us to have these babies. So they'll grow up just to cut them a check to. How many of these places do you think are out there? I probably a dozen at least. I mean, if not more, I know the main ones in Florida. You ever notice all the crazy happening in Florida? Do you think Mary Esther is still downstairs? Why? I saw a phone in her room. I wanna go try to call my mom. Are you crazy? Why, if she catches you? So I'll get a strike. I just have to know if my mom's okay. No, Wait, are you... Oh, that line hasn't worked for a while now. Keep meaning to fix it, but there's no point. I'm afraid, this is your first strike Emma. No, I was just trying to... You were just snooping where you shouldn't be. Now, be the good girl I know you are and go to dinner. Trust me. You don't want another strike. And that's when her dad walked in us. 'Cause she wasn't supposed to come back until later that night. But then like, "Oh my God." And then of course they told my Grammy and she like freaked out. So the second I get out of here, I'm gonna go see her. She lives in Seattle now, but it's kind of why I'm here is cuz I got caught talking to her online again. So... Are you even gonna try Kris? Why should I, when you try hard enough for the both of us. Jackson, don't listen to her. This program works. I mean look at HanK and Mary Esther as proof. Yeah, that's a really good selling point. I too hope one day to have a stick as firmly implanted in my ass. These are their chicken. Is what I hope we're having tonight. Yeah. Keep laughing. Not fall the way to hell. You know, Joel, when you get over traumatic like that, your inner queen really shines through. Where is Hank? Well, what a wonderful question. Let me go find him. I'd hate for his food to get cold. Don't eat before prayer. A few of us have learned that the hard way. You know, Mattel would be nice every now and then. If my aunt saw the charges, we'd be screwed. Hank, are you in there? I'll be on a second. I've I've got a stomach ache. Don't take too long. So I applied for another job last week. Well yeah, well maybe you can get the hotel room. It's in Chicago. Well. I mean, I just thought you should know in case I get it know and I probably won't but if I do, I'd like you to come with me. I think you should leave out the back door. I don't want my aunt to get suspicious. I Was a drinker. I was on drugs and wandering through the wilderness of sin. I was a gambler. I used to be homosexual. Not anymore. Not anymore. Not anymore. Not anymore. These are the faces of people, just like you and me who are once sinners and resists and have had their lives turned around by the guidance of Abraham house. - Let me see it. - Hello? I'm Andrew eight founder of children of Abraham. You know, most people don't know. All you have to do to be one of God's chosen warriors is to ask him to save you and then tell him that you will save as many souls as you can from the shackles of sin until you die. Because the more souls you save for Jesus, the greater you'll be in his eyes. And the greater your are in the Lord's eyes, the greater your reward is in heaven. I'm not gonna sugar coat it, folks, we have to be willing to die for what we believe in. Our very livelihood and our children's lives, depend on it. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Do you think Jesus wants a bunch of lady-boys, baby-killers and whores in his kingdom? Is being one of those worth losing out on an eternity with him. If so, I hope you didn't pack your winter coat with you, cuz you're going straight to hell. Where did you go this morning? I told you Mason, he... How are we supposed to save these children's souls? If one of us is still sinning, Take out your sin stick and get it hard. - Your friend, she seems - what? Nothing. I just thought we were sitting here to get away from people like that. People like what? Come on Emma, she was making fun of the videos. Did you see them? I mean, come on. Those people are obviously brainwashed. Or are they just happy? Oh my God. You're falling for it, aren't you? It's just two more days. It's not that long. Let's just hope that mom has a plan. Rebecca said her and her sister have been here almost a week. Maybe they need more help than we do. Try to get some sleep. She said they locked her sister in a room for two days. How is that supposed to help anyone. Follow the rules and you wanna have to find out. I was just trying to call mom. Why? Because I'm afraid that he's gonna hurt her. Why would he do that? You're right. We should just get some sleep. Follow the rules. And we'll be fine for me, for mom. If she hasn't called by tomorrow, I'm getting out of here. One way or another. Yeah, you won't be tempted to use that thing for a while. Hank, we're doing the right thing. The rewards in God's kingdom out number any patents of the flesh. Think how proud God will be of us. He came to me last night. Well the girl downstairs, she didn't wanna be saved. What was I supposed to do? Let her corrupt the rest of us? I'm not going to be responsible for that. I can't... Is only the ones who don't wanna be saved. No one's gonna to miss them. Not society, not their parents. It got a little messy. Try not to make too much noise when you clean it up. Has my mom called yet? They day is still young, she might give us a ring later. Lots of yummy vitamins for you all, get you all strong. And I went ahead and laid out the bacon. Rebecca, please work on your gate. I could hear you clumping all the way down the hall. Like a truck driver. We can't have that. Not today. What's today? After breakfast, we're having a makeup tutorial and then we're having a sort of Fashion show. Were you making a plate for Megan this morning? I'll do it later. She should have called know. She's know he's done something horrible to her. Hey you okay. I just have to find a way in there to see Megan. I mean, just to know she's okay. I think I know where Mary Esther keeps the keys. And how are we gonna get those? I don't know. Wait until they fall asleep and sneak in. What if we get caught and wind up where Megan is? This is your sixth day. Don't you wanna at least try. Hurry up girls. Keep the boys waiting off. There. Much better. You have five minutes. You really think this will work. These are women. They will put on this earth to please you to pleasure you and to bear are and raise your children. Aren't they pretty? Well girls. You're not doing very much to entice these young men or you show a little skin. I don't feel comfortable... Emma, doing God's work it's never comfortable. That were, there'd be more true believers out there. Rebecca. Show her how it's done. Look, you're used to taking off your clothes for boys. Aren't you? And Hank, you choose who's first up to bat. Jackson, why don't you come up here? Take it out. Wait. Huh? Didn't you hear me? Did you hear me? I said, take it Out. I can handle this. Oh, can you I'd like to see, try to save these souls when you can't even save your own. Jackson, do what she tells you. I don't really think I... I'd hate to tell your parents you gotta strike. Hey, Hey, you don't have, have to do this. No it's for his own good. Get back where you were unless you're going for your second strike. It's fine. I want to get better. Now, Jackson, look at Rebecca. I want you to look at her. Look at her and get it hard. Oh, it shouldn't be too difficult if you're a real man. Hank. You should be watching this. You could learn a thing or two. No, don't look at him look at her. Oh, I thought you enjoyed showing off your body. That's what got you into this situation in the first place. Isn't it. But don't be shy now. Oh, What's wrong. Can only get excited if the whole tennis team watches. Christina, why don't you step up to the plate. Now, entice Jackson. Stop. Do you wanna stop Jackson? Will a real man stop. You think your stepfather would stop. Please, stop. Oh, Maybe you need a little more of this wage? I said stop it. Joel. Why don't you come up here? No, this class is dismissed. Go to your rooms for Bible study. Jackson will resume this tomorrow. I hope for your sake, you come better prepared. Hate to think I was wrong about you. Why don't you want me saving these children? Did it really save you? Did it save me? Not knock. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but hey day? Of Course. But you won't have to worry about it next month. I just got a new job In Chicago. I'll be leaving in a couple days. Well, I would say, what will we do without your work in the garden? But the good Lord tells me we'll manage. How are we gonna get back to civilization after we sneak out? Hitchhike, swim, okay? Their car keys have got to be on that set of keys. Oh great, stay in the car. That'll look great on my record. What other choice do we have? We have got to get out if you're and go home. Must be nice. What? Having a home to go back to. Even if I get out of here, they're still gonna send me somewhere else. Somewhere where they're just taking me in for the extra check money every month. Somewhere without Meghan. You really love Meghan a lot, don't you? I mean, even though we don't share blood, she's always been there for me. And I like to think I've always been there for her too. Then be there for her now and get her out of there. And Jackson, is he coming with us? I don't know. You can't just leave him here. I know. Now, have to persuade him somehow. Hey, what is that stuff St. Mary Esther always puts in the Kool-Aid. Vitamins and... I guess. I don't know. That's what I thought too, but... But what. Something about the way she reacted and I caught her mixing it in this morning. What do you think it is, poison or something? I don't know. Although it is kind of weird ever since we got here, I've had an easier time sleeping. I mean, Jackson practically had to shake me awake this morning. You know, come to think of it. I have been sleeping better since I got here. And you think it'd be the opposite, right? I guess there's only a way to find out if there's something in it. Should we start without him? Huh, that would be rude. Wouldn't it? What are you doing? We saw Mary Esther put something in it this morning. We? Emma saw put something in it. It's probably just vitamins. What if it's poisoning or something? Why do you always assume the worst? First it was Robbie, mow it's Hank and Mary Esther. Did you ever think they might wanna help us? What they did this afternoon? What you call that help? Are you eating? I'm not hungry. Well, a fast for Peanuts. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Mom has a plan. Why do you wanna jeopardize that? Because, I'm afraid if like he's going to do to her. What's he gonna do to her Emma provide for her. Why would he do that? He must have an ulterior motive. Just like her last boyfriend and the one before that and all the other ones you've driven off. Because he told me he'd kill her, if I said anything. If he told anyone what. God, he's the reason I'm here. I mean always you think do this to me? Some I met at a party. No, no he would. Jackson, listen to me. I'm not gonna wait around here to see if he's telling the truth. If you care about mom at all, please just trust me here. Rebecca. You're not supposed to drink before we say Grace. I got those things, I'm sorry. This is your second strike. Least I made extra Rebecca, why don't you say grace? Seems only appropriate, you should try to get right with God. Lord, thank you for this day. And for all the things you've given us. Thank you for the food that we're about to eat. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. My throat's been so scratchy. This morning, I'd like to ask you folks to imagine a world with me for a moment, if you will. In this world, you are respected, in this world you are loved for exactly who you are. Surprise folks. This world's a real place and it's called heaven. Now folks, all we have to do to get to heaven. - Enjoy... - Can I go to the bathroom? God's love. - Hurry back. - Make a few sacrifices along the way on the what'll be when. What a great day will when you get to heaven? ♪ God bless you ♪ ♪ Blood and bless him ♪ ♪ You prepare ♪ Strike three, you are out. I couldn't let you leave Rebecca. God didn't love you yet. ♪ The streets of gold ♪ ♪ When we all will get to heaven ♪ Hey, you okay? Fine. I don't think what she did was right. She just wants me to get better. How's that working out for you? You're not scared, are you? You're not scared about going to hell. Couldn't be any worse than a summer in the south. The thing is Jackson, I don't consider myself a bad person and you don't seem like you're one either. But is there something wrong with us? Maybe there's something wrong with them. Hey, take a look at this. Look familiar. Is that me? Yeah. Thought you had a nice face of you're not offended. Can I keep this? Yeah. You know, two men aren't supposed to be in the same bedroom at the same time, so- - Okay, why don't you go brush your teeth? I heard it's recommended you do that more than two times a week. Jackson don't fall for it. She has no intention of saving her home. Maybe God loves her already. Maybe she doesn't need to change. She never came back after she went to the bathroom. Well she's with her sister in the basement. Hoped it wouldn't come to that, but it did. Why, what did she do? Oh, that's not important. I'm sure I won't have the same problems with you too. Then get to sleep. Shh, don't wake her up. Are you leaving? Can I come with you? Where are you going. Anywhere but here. You just don't make any noise. I should get the others. No. Mary Esther's a really light sleeper. We have to go now. Can I get my shoes? I'll be at the car. Okay. Is Hank joining us? Hm he's off visiting a sick friend. Don't know when he'll be back. Where's Kris? Oh, she's here. Where? Which is definitely in here. I can practically taste. In fact, you all may be able to as well. Sit down. I can treat you get up, did I? That's better. Now, I'm not gonna have any problems with you three, am I? Oh. Hold on. What are you doing? I'm going to get Rebecca and Megan out of there. I know where she keeps her keys. Let me get the keys, wait a second. Hey, is Hank here? You went to see a friend. And why is his car still here? Is it? Oh, that's funny. Maybe caught a ride with someone. Some other little friend of his he's had so many. I'll tell him you stop by. No, no. What did you do with him? Look, you're not the first little friend he's taken the liking to, but you'll definitely be the last. Best luck in whatever sin city you're going to just please leave before I call the police. I don't think you want that kind of attention on this place. Now tell me where he is. He's out at the lake. Oh, my God, No, no. Jackson. Hey, I got the keys. Come on. Let's get Rebecca and Megan out of there. We need something to cut the room. I'm gonna go get a knife. Hang on one second, Rebecca. We're gonna get you out of here. Huh! We have to get out of here. Shit! Please help. Help. No! No! Shut up. Jesus is coming from me. Oh my babies. What happens? We thought he'd done something horrible to you. No baby. Why would you think that? Oh God. Oh my God. Okay, let's get you inside. I was gonna call tonight. What happened to the two of you? They tried to kill us, mom. You must be hungry. Let me fix you something to eat. Did you know what kind of a place that was? Please tell me, you didn't know. Maybe I could call Abraham house and see if they're- - They're all dead. Everyone. You said you were gonna call, you never called. You said you'd call. You said that you would come back for us. I was gonna call you. I was gonna call you tonight. Bull shit. Okay, Jackson, can you please calm your sister down? We were never supposed to get out of that place, Were we? All you had to do was just follow the rules, Emma. I mean, why didn't you just follow the rules. Emma. You don't hate me. Do you Jackson? I was thinking that we could leave tonight and we could go somewhere special. Just the three of us. Would you like that? It wasn't about saving us. It was about saving you. Jackson. You don't want your mom to go to hell, do you. Honey, you wouldn't want that. Would you? Help! Help! Help! Oh. Mum? Stop! So where are we going now? I was thinking Florida. You forgot guys, all the weird shit happens in Florida.
