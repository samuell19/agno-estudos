Good morning, my darlings. You had a good night? [Laughing] Yes, Mama. I dreamed we moved out west and I became a famous gunslinger. Ha! Like that could happen. Well, it seemed real to me. [Bell Chimes] Look at the time. Where is your father? I'll go get him. No, I will. [Snoring] Morning, Papa. Time to get up. Okay, okay. I'm fine. I'm awake! Then how come you look asleep? [Groaning] Wishful thinking! Hurry, Papa, or you'll be late for your job at the factory. All right. Okay. I'm up! Happy? I-I was just trying to help. Tanya, wait. I didn't-- What's all the excitement? [Whimpering] Papa's so mean lately. So! I hope you're satisfied. Tanya, I'm sorry. Tell her I'm sorry. [Moans] Papa, are you okay? Ah, Fievel. It's just that I’m not as young as I used to be. Me neither! Fievel, what I mean is I’m tired. Back in Russia, I taught music. Sometimes I made a few violins to sell. Two jobs was enough. Ay, but here in America, here you need three! Isn't that good? Well, yes...and no. Yes, because it's the only way for us to get ahead and build a better life. And also no, because sometimes when I'm so worn out, I forget to be kind to my own family. Ah, don 't worry Papa. It'll work out. Like you always tell me, “In America, you are truly free.“ Heh-heh-heh. That is true. “Free to succeed and free to fail.“ Ay, that is also true. “Free to be a little crumb one day... and the next, a big cheese.“ That is also also true. Of course, he also said... there were no cats in America! Hmph! That's okay Papa. You can't be right about everything. [Laughing] Little Fievel. It's good you are so full of hope. Of course he's full of hope. He's your son, isn't he? Yeah, and you're my papa, Papa. [ Mama ] Be careful, Fievel. G'bye! [All] ♪ We work all night and day ♪ Hey, Philly!

This one's on me. Thanks, Tony. It's the least I can do. After all, it was your dad who got me my job at the cheese factory. Wow, you must be rich! Oh. [Burps] Pardon me. Ha! Ooh. Tiger, I only been workin' for a week. Gettin' rich takes at least... a month! Gee, I can't wait to get a job! Oh, I wouldn't rush if I was you. How come? Well, now that I'm working, I got responsibilities. Oh. But you can still go wherever you want whenever you want. Yeah! So... where am I going? Right in there. Wow! What is it? Oh, something I, uh, personally discovered just recently. The Beach Pneumatic Subway. Beach? I don't see any beach. Beach is the guy who built it. Oh, good, because I get fleas... at the beach. What's a subway? An underground train. This I gotta see! We're talking about a really big, nasty, loud machine here, right? What are you, afraid? [Train Rumbling] Who, me? Ha-ha! No. I just think it would be better if! stand guard up here and, uh, and... protect your flank! Ha-ha! And we are supposed to buy this story? Actually, I was kinda hoping... yes. Tony, come on! Come on! Fine. Wait here. Good plan! [Birds Cooing] [Train Rumbling] - There it is. - Ooh! [Tony] See that huge fan over there? When they turned it on, whoosh! It blew the car along so fast... you slammed back in your seat. Wow! Your eyes bugged out. Your hair stood back. Your cheeks flapped in the wind. [Glass Squeaking] [Gasps] [ Fievel] Double wow! [Tony] Problem is, it didn't work too good. So about twelve years ago, they closed it up. Aw! Hey, get a load of this. Hello. [Echoing] Hello. Hello. Hoo-o-o-o. Hoo-o-o-o. Hoo-o-o-o. [Together] Ho-o-o-o-o. Hoo-o-o-o. Hoo-o-o-o. [Together] Ooh! Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three-- Oh! Who am I foolin'? The only flank I'm protecting is mine. Those poor little guys, down there in that dark pit all by themselves. Oh! I'm a fraud. I'm a failure. I'm-- Ahh! I'm goin' after them. It's so dark in here! Fiev? Fievel? Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo-hoo. Tony? Maybe I can see 'em from there. [Rumbling] [Together] Ahh! Maybe- Maybe we oughta go back. Yeah. Tiger's probably getting worried about us, huh? That too. [Shouting] [Clattering] Uh-oh. [Clattering, Rumbling] What's that? [Tony Shouting] - Fievel! - [Grunting] Help! I’m stuck! [Both Screaming] We're dead, right? Uh, I don't think so. Hey, my body's numb, and I'm staring into a tunnel of light. We are talking deceased here. Tony, we fell into a hole underneath the tunnel. The floor just gave way. Oh, boy. Am I relieved. What kind of place is this? You got me, but from the smell, I'd say something crawled in here and... died! What was that? It's-- Eww! It's got something in its paw. What's it say? It's too dark. I'll light a match. [Both Screaming] [Grunting] [Rumbling] Tony! Fievel! Where are you? Ya-hoo! [Screaming] Oh! [Horse Whinnying] [Man] Giddyap! [Fievel] Are you sure this is the place? [Tony] “Absotively." I helped this guy, Dr. Dithering, move some stuff last month. He's real smart. Ah, my, yes. Young, uh, young- Tony. Tony Toponi. Yes, of course. Do- Do come in. [Chuckling] I just- A little snug in the- [Dithering] So... what brings you here? [Tony] Uh, see, my pals and me, well, we got a question maybe you could answer. Fine! Always glad to encourage young minds and all that. Great! So... you know that subway tunnel you told me about? You said you discovered it. I didn't say I didn't have help. You didn't go in there, did you? I told 'em not to. Honest I did. [Tony] Ah, put a lid on it, will ya? [Tony] Honest. Nothin' happened. - Oh, oh- Careful. - Ah! Oh! Delicate, you know. Sorry. Anyway, we was walkin' in the tunnel, mindin' our own business- Then a train came, and my coat got caught, and we fell down a hole and we saw this skeleton. [Chuckling] Oh, my. Nothing happened, you say? [Tony] Well, nothin' permanent, anyway. Philly, show him the map. Hmm? Map? Hmm. Scuttlebutt? What? - What are you doing in there? - I’m... cataloging. Yeah. - That's it. I’m keepin' your files up to date. - Ah, good lad. Now, I need you to bring over the large magnifier. Oh,yes. The large magnifier. It's what I live for. Shovin' around half a ton o' glass. Who's the ray of sunshine? My assistant Scuttlebutt. Odd chap, really. Always poking about, wondering what I'm up to. [Grunting] The large magnifier, like you asked. Excellent. Hold this, will you? Right. But I won't enjoy it. Hmm. Ah! This is an artifact from the former indigenous population. What does “in-di-jun-ous“ mean? The local inhabitants. What we incorrectly refer to as “Indians. " [Incoherent Yelling] Indians? Hmm. Some branch of the Delaware tribes, or rather, from the size of this map, the mice who lived among them. Told you he was smart. If you’d like, I shall attempt to decipher it for you. Hey, Professor, that'd be terr- [Bell Chiming] Holy spumoni! I gotta get to the factory! - What about the map? - Can't wait! If they catch me comin' late, I am a dead rodent! Maybe Tony was right. Having a job doesn't sound fun at all. It has a downside, definitely. Definitely. [Hoofbeats] [Man] That'll do it. [Men Talking] [Horse Whinnying] [Panting] [Male Mouse] Stop right there! Oh! [Bearers Grunting In Unison] [Knocking] [Bearers Groaning] [ Bearer Groans] What have we here, Mr. O'Bloat? Hmm. It appears to be one of our workers, Mr. Grasping, but he's late for his shift. Well, we can't have that. Can we, Mr. Toplofty? Ay! No, indeed. Sets a bad example. [Groans] - Let me explain! - We don't want excuses, boy. We want results. Then don't fire him. And you are? My name is Mousekewitz, sir. All right, Mousekewitz. Why should we let this dawdler keep his job? He won't be late again. H-He's afraid of you. I'll make sure he knows you call the shots. Hmm. See that you do. [O'Bloat] Have you gone soft, Grasping? Why didn't you fire that boy? Because the Russian was right. Fear... is a powerful motivator. From now on, that boy will be the very picture of punctuality. [Toplofty] Yes, well, be that as it may, why is that old mouse butting in? Who is he to say what's right and wrong? Yes. What is he? Some sort of leader among mice? That spineless old fool? He could hardly look us in the eye. He may be spineless, but he got what he wanted out of you. And that makes him a troublemaker! Very well. Perhaps we will keep an eye on Mr. Mousekewitz. [Men Talking, Indistinct] The coast is clear. Ahh! Easy does it now! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Easy now. Lower away. Seven hundred fifty-one. [Bell Rings] Seven hundred fifty-two. Seven hundred fifty-three. Huh? Hey, Mr. Mousekewitz. Boy, you really saved my tail back there. Thanks. You're welcome. The way you spoke up to them guys- It was amazin'! You ain't afraid of nothin'. No, Tony. Lately I'm afraid of everything. I don't get it. They let you keep your job because I convinced them... I was a coward and that I could teach you to be one too! Ow! Oh! Ah. Hmm. Aha. [Gasps] Aha! Ahh! Oh, my! We must find Tony! Ahhh! Ah. Hey! What is it? What does it say? Here, now. What's the rush? Oh, lovely. Thanks. Here you go. Here. Here you go. Thank you. Nothin' for you, Toponi. Bosses says you was late. Well, yeah, maybe ten minutes. So I lose a whole week's pay? You're lucky you still got a job. Next! [Gasps] - Here. Here ya go. Next. - Thanks. Here. Move along. Come on! Next! [Dog Howling] [Sighs] So much for gettin' rich. Whoa! Tony! Just the guy we're lookin' for! You lads have made a-a-an amazing discovery! O-O-One for the history books, I should think. What are you talkini' about? This, uh, map is a-a diagram... of an underground t-t-tunnel system. You mean the subway? No, no. Another one, un-un-underneath it, built centuries ago by the Indian mice. Kind of a- a maze. Yeah? That's “a-maze-ing.“ Oh, why, yes. But wait until you hear what's at the bottom of it. [Together] Well? According to this, at the end of the maze is- a-and I quote- “our greatest treasure.“ - Treasure? - Treasure? [Together] Treasure! Absolutely not! - But, Papa- - “But, Papa“ nothing. What? You wanna crawl down some rat hole- - No offense. - Oh, none taken. After some cockamamy buried treasure? It's not cockamamy. It's real! Mama, can't I go? Sure. So what if it gives your mother a heart attack from worrying? Go! Enjoy! Ah, Mama. I'll be okay. And I'll come back with a treasure. Ah, feh! Where is the proof? A so-called map? Not even written in a language! just a bunch of d-d-doodles! I think it's pretty. Tanya, don't help. Papa, why did we leave Russia? We were going to be eaten. You need a better reason? Papa, I'm serious! You always say that in America, if a mouse works hard and gets lucky, he can make a fortune. So? So finding the map was the lucky part. Going down that tunnel: That's the hard work. Philly's right, Mr. M. We're never gonna make it workin' for those fat rats at the factory. Please, Papa. There's no reason to be afraid. Okay. So go. [Sobbing] He can't go. He's just a kid. I'm older. Let me go. Tanya, don't help. No! If Tanya goes, nobody goes! Relax, Mama. She's not going. No fair, no fair, no fair! He always gets to do the exciting stuff, and all I get to do is... laundry. She does have a point. Which only matches the one on your head. Tanya, you are staying here, and that is that! [Raspberry] I am going to put a lot of starch in everything you wear. I assure you, madam, there is nothing to be concerned about. Think of it as a- [Stuttering] Well, as a-a field trip. See? Think of it as a rite of passage.? - See? - Think of it as a disaster waiting to happen. [All] Tanya, don't help! Ah, then it's settled! [ Door Opens, Closes] We'll start off in the morning. In the meantime, we must gather supplies. Scuttlebutt? Strange. Where did he go? [Hoofbeats] [Men Chattering] ♪♪ [ Nightclub Music] So me and the boys cornered the little rabble-rouser, see? Then he looks at me and asks, “Have you no mercy?“ So I says, “Wait, now. Let me check. As a matter of fact, no!” And that's when we let him have it. [Cackling] Bravo. [All Laughing] The way I see it, every time a ship docks in the harbor, we get a new load of troublemakers. So it's my job to keep 'em in line. That is why we pay you. For which I am most grateful. [Knock at Door] A Mr. Scuttlebutt, sirs. Begging your pardons, gents. Come in, come in. Chief McBrusque, have you two met? Well, I don't see any broken bones, so probably not! [All Laughing] [Nervous Laughing] Scuttlebutt here works with Dr. Dithering, a pack rat who lives up in the museum on 79th. We support Dr. Dithering's research... as part of our public “commitment to culture,” but, uh- What Dithering doesn't know is... Scuttlebutt reports to us. Yes, just in case the good doctor digs up something... we might like to keep for ourselves. Well, then, gents, interested in a treasure map? [Papa] I hope you find your fortune. Here, Fievel. Take this for luck. Thanks, Mama. - Eh, what is it? - Matzo ball soup. Mama, it's not a picnic. We're exploring a tunnel! So? A person's got to eat. I assure you, madam, we have more than enough provisions, which are also easier to carry. [Grunting] That's a matter of opinion. [Fievel] Don't worry, Mama. I'll be fine. He always says that, but then- Tanya. I know, I know. Don't help. Sure. March me to the center of the Earth. Save for the constant pain, I don't mind at all. Cheer up, Mr. Scuttlebutt. If we’re right, there's a reward waiting at the end of the line. Heh-heh-heh. Spotty little runt. If I had me way, the only thing waitin' for you... at the end of the line would be the end of the line! [Unintelligible Talking] [Water Rushing] I say. Do you hear something? Sounds like... running water. What? Like them injuns had indoor plumbing? Get off! I don't know. It's awful wet. I believe there's an underground river... just beyond this wall. Ooh, what's this mean? Ah. It seems the natives suffered some sort of cataclysm, as in an invasion or a flood. Flood! I-I-I'm allergic to that much water. Guys? Huh? Fiev! Tony! Hey, guys, wait for me! [Crashing] Get off! Get off! Get off! Oh. Uh, sorry. What you lookin' at? Ooh! [Tony] Get a load of this place! [Rumbling] [Tony] What's goin' on? I'm getting a real sinking feeling! Oh, my! Seems we've triggered some sort of a pressure pad. - Which means? - Which means we're going to, uh, what is it? You know-- - Die? - Yes, that's it. [All Screaming] [Scuttlebutt] Comin' through! Make way! [Screaming Continues] Right. I quit. Live it up. Here you go. Take it! Take it! Take it! [Grunting] Huh? - Give me that! - [Clattering] [Screaming] Can we go heme now? [Rumbling] [All Screaming] [Tiger Groaning] Uh, where are we? [Tony] Ask them. - Whoa! - Here, now, those are sharp! You talk with the English tongue. [Stammering] Yes,yes. English. Right. Cheerio. Pip-pip. ♪ God save our gracious- ♪ And you have a cat with you. Who? Me? Oh. Yes, but... I’m thinking of converting. Honest, mister. We're harmless. Regular choirboys. If only we had some sort of a peace offering. I know. Mama's matzo ball soup. [Grunts] Ah. We have heard legend of this matzo ball soup. Strong medicine. [Speaking Native Language] [All] Ahh! Oy, that must be some soup! I am Wulisso, sakima of this clan. [Groaning, Stammering] Look, I don't wish to be rude, but what are you doing here? There haven't been Indians in New York for 200 years. - You speak of the Lenape. - Quite so. Lenape is what the Delaware Indians called themselves. Our ancestors watched... as the European humans came in their boats, bringing disease, gunpowder-- [Hissing] Cats! I feel so ashamed! And we watched as the Europeans mistreated the Lenape. Killed many... and scattered the rest. Our ancestors did not wait for the European mice to do the same to them. Instead they found refuge here in the ground, safe, hidden from the world. And that is how we have stayed! They're gonna scalp us! Ahh! Are you really gonna scalp us? [Laughing] Of course not. We are peaceful mice. And to prove it, we shall have a feast in your honor. Until then, you will need someone... to show you around the cavern. Cholena. Yes, Father. Buona sera, bella signorina. This is my daughter, Cholena. She will serve as your guide. No kiddin'? Fantastic! Terrif- If you got nothing better to do. It will be my pleasure. - What's this? - My handmaiden Tankho.

Oh, yeah. Well, I like those. Mine... mine... mine... also mine. Ooh, and this is mine too. [Laughing] What are all those drawings on the stick? Why is he pouring- So many questions. You are like a chirping cricket. Sorry. Do not apologize. It is good to ask. That is how we learn. So... it's okay to be a cricket? Yes. In fact, from now on... I will call you Zelozelos. In our language that means cricket. What are you gonna call me? Hmm. I will call you... Pullaook. Pullaook Yeah. What means pullaook? It is our word for turkey. Swell. [Grunting] [Tankho Laughing] You again! Back off!? You are stealing! And what are you gonna do about it? [Blow Landing] [Screaming] Good grief, man! What could possibly possess you to do such a thing? Incredibly poor form! Nah, you got it all wrong. Everyone was off dancin', so I thought I'd tidy up a bit. This is a serious matter. We open our home to you, but how do you respond? With thievery... and deceit! Chief, you gotta believe me. We had nothing to do with this. I mean, look. The guys a rat, you know? [Snoring, Unintelligible Muttering] What is the matter, Zelozelos? Oh, I just was thinkin'. We're no better than Scuttlebutt. See? We found this map, and it told us about your... treasure. That's why we came: to grab it for ourselves. Just like Scuttlebutt. You did not know we were here. You are not thieves. Yes, we are! [Unintelligible Muttering] Come with me, Zelozelos. This... is our greatest treasure. But... it’s just a string of beads! It is wampum. It is the history of our tribe told in symbols. W-We risked our lives for that? Zelozelos, treasure comes in many forms. For us, it is our heritage. The wampum reminds us of our life with the Lenape, of our journey here and being separated from everything we once knew. See what I mean? The settlers just stomped in and took over. If that’s the American dream, I want nothing to do with it! Do not be hasty, Zelozelos.

Hey, I’m talkin' to you! You see? There's that Mousekewitz again, stirring up trouble. They're all ungrateful louts, and it’s just the beginning. Dissent is like a disease. So we must cure them of it, before the infection spreads. [ Train Whistle Blowing] We could use some help, you know. Nothing showy. Just a sign to let us know you're listening. - Fievel! - Papa! Oh, it's about time you got home. I want to hear everything, but first, oh, you wouldn't believe what happened at the factory. [Clears Throat] Papa, we have a guest. A pleasure, I'm sure. So, as I was saying- Papa, this is Cholena. It is an honor to meet the father of my friend Fievel. Y-Y-You are an Indian? [Fievel] Yeah. She's from this old tribe that lives in a big cave right under New York City. This is your idea of a sign? [Laughing] [Whistle Blowing] [Shrieking] An Indian? Uh-huh. That's charming. First you let Mousekewitz tell you what to do. Now his son is giving that little princess a guided tour. We have to find her, fast! Forget about her. What about the rest of them? Good gravy! A tribe of savages right under our feet? What if they invade us? Ah, they wouldn't stand a chance against my boys. And what makes you so sure? Well, for one thing, we don't fight fair! Oh. That does make a difference. [Groaning] You're all missing the point. These Indians are the answer to our problems with the workers. [O'Bloat] Are you mad? Not at all. The best way to keep those malingerers in line... is to provide them- and us- with a common enemy. I see. We set ourselves up as the workers' champions and protectors. And turn them against the Indians. Of course, there'll be horrible losses among the workers. But if we 're clever about it, most of them... will be the anarchists and miscreants in the crowd.

Even as we speak, they lie in wait... beneath our very paws. Oh, he knows about the cave. He's talking about Cholena! [Grasping] Now, you all know what these creatures are like.

They wear uniforms, and they make sure everyone obeys the law. Th-Then they will help us. No. - [Shouting] - Here they come! [Shouting] If we stay here, they’ll find Cholena for sure! Hurry! Wear this, and keep your head down! [ McBrusque] My guess is she's probably wearin' a disguise. Search every rat nest and mouse hole in the city. Tear everything apart until you find that injun! - Now go! - [All] Yes, sir! - [Shouting] - There he is! Stop this instant! Let me go! [Female Mouse] You're in on the injun plot, aren't ya? Don't deny it! What plot? Oh, Scuttlebutt! Thank heavens. Quickly! Tell them I'm innocent. Who? Me? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Never seen the bloke in me life! Traitor! Turncoat! [Shouting] [Raspberries] Whew! [Screaming] Papa! Mama! Tanya! [Tanya] Help me! Get that girl! - Traitors! - Cholena! Buzz off, kid! Aaah! Hang on! I'm comin'! - Ooh! - Indians! We've got to save Cholena. Ow! Hey! I’m with ya! Fievel! Make 'em pay! Oh! Uh! Fievel! Tanya! [Shrieking] In here, Papa. Ah-ah-choo! Oh! My poor darlings! Where are Fievel and Tony? And where is Cholena? She must have been carried away by the mob. Oh, if they recognize her, they'll-- Tanya. Find Fievel and Tony. Then meet us back here. Mama and I are going for help. We are? Who's going to help? Could everyone just go and do? [Shouting] Oh, my! Oh, help! Oh, oh- Help! We got one of the traitors! Good. Take him to the butcher shop. Huh? What have we here? But don't do nothin' till we get there! We've got a little unfinished business. [Grunting] Well, what do ya know? It's the little Indian maiden. [Tony] Yo, potato-for-brains! Up here! Charge! Yah! [Grunting] [Sighs] Oh, thank you. [Tanya] Fievel, would you hurry? Come back here, ya hooligans! Papa? Mama? Papa said they'd be here. What if the mob got 'em? What if they’re in jail? What if- What if we stop already? Papa! Mama! Mama, you're okay. Fievel, you and Tony take Cholena back underground. Wait a minute! What about me? It's not fair! I never get a chance to do any-- Okay. Okay, already. Go. Honest? You mean it? Yes! Ya-hoo! I mean- Ahem. Good. Fievel, you have the map? Sure, but what are you gonna do? While you take Cholena home, Mama and I will keep the crowd occupied and save Dr. Dithering. Gee, how you gonna do that? We will create a diversion. What's a “diversion“? Me. [Chuckles] Look. ls it wise for us to be here? I mean, that mob's out for blood! Yes, but since McBrusque here failed to catch the Indian girl, we 'll have to make Dr. Dithering the designated donor. Dr. Dithering, do you admit to aiding the Indian? Well, yes, but I don't see why- Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Make him pay! - [McBrusque] You heard the man! - [Mob] Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Oh, oh, oh, my. Oh-oh! [Tiger Yowls] Excuse me for just one minute, Doc. [Growling] Woof! [Muttering] [Chuckles] Wrong species. [Gasping] [ Papa] Stop! Enough! Didn't we come to America to escape such madness? Yet here you are, condemning someone based on lies and rumors. Don't you see? The enemy isn't Dr. Dithering or the Indians. It's them! Dividing us with hatred, ignorance, fear. Don't listen to him! He's not one of us! He's a foreigner! Mister, we are all foreigners. The only ones who really belong here are the Indians. [PapaJ All the rest of us have in common... is our dream of a better life. All we got in common is America. [Cheering] Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Get us out of here! [McBrusque] Stand back there! I'll split your noggin! Congratulations, Grasping. Now you've got every mouse in Manhattan hating us! What if the Indians send reinforcements? Form an alliance with the workers? Take over the factory? Get a grip on yourself! We're not through yet. McBrusque! - Yes, sir. - Find that Indian cave, and turn it into a burial ground. Yes, sir! Ah, good luck with that. Which reminds me. I'm gonna need a guide. I'd sooner die than go down there again. Well, that just about sums up your choices, doesn't it? [Whimpering] [Panting] Stop. Stop! Stop! Here it is! [Cholena] Huh? [McBrusque] This way, boys. It's Chief McBrusque, and he's got his goons with him. [Chattering] Here. [Inhaling] I love the smell of it. Which way? [McBrusque] We're gainin' on 'em, boys! Oh, I wish Dr. Dithering were here! Wait! Those are our footprints from before. This way! I’m tellint' ya, turn back! Those injuns are fiends, brutes! They tried to scalp me. You keep whinin', and I might let 'em. [Gulping] Suit yourself, but when we're all walkin' around like a rack of snooker balls, don't blame me. Yow-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ooh! Ooh! [Panting] - Tanya, no! - What's the matter? The room on the other side is full of booby traps. Whoa! That's right. We barely got through there in one piece. So we either go in there or back up to meet the cops. Wait. My father once told me of a way around the traps. If only I could remember. I can almost see it, as if it were here in my paw. That's it! Fievel, what are you doing? I wondered what that paw print on the map meant. Look! [Rumbling] [Cholena] Hurry! [Grunting] No! Sorry. Stop. - As far as I go. - [Growling] What's the matter now! You go through that door, you're gonna be minced mouse pie! Are you tellin' me that we're almost there? Well, yes and no. About time. All right, men. Attack formation. [Chattering] [McBrusque] Charge! [Shouting] [Creaking] [Slashing Noises] [Shouting, Screaming] [Tanya] Wow! You got that right. Forgive me, Father. I failed. Cholena, do not blame yourself for the ways of the upper world. It is not your fault that they are still greedy and ruthless. Not all of us. just some. What are you going to do? We do not have any choice. We will defend ourselves. But I fear that we will go down in defeat. Hey, what about all those booby traps? All you need is a few more and- They were built long ago by our ancestors. Today, we do not know the ways of war. We are no match for the upper-worlders. Maybe you don't have to be. What do you mean? It's like what Papa said. We need to create a diversion. [Grunting] Now I’m angry- Told ya it was dangerous. Did anyone listen? No. Might as well have been talkin' to a brick wall! [Groaning] [Screaming] All right. Where are they? Cowards! Soon as they heard us comin', they turned tail! [Whimpering] Now! Where do ya think you're goin'? [All] Home! Ow. I suppose I should expect this by now. Come back, ya nose-wipin', tail-turnin', double-dealin'- Aw, forget it. Wait for me! [Cheering] Yeah! Hooray! Oh, Father, we are safe. Not for long, child. The upper-worlders will be back. They will come in greater numbers... with more powerful weapons, and we will be lost. Isn't there anything you can do? Yes. Seal the ancient tunnel. No. You'll be buried alive! Do not worry. Our air shafts will not be harmed. Besides, we have other ways to visit the upper world. [Sniffles] You do? Where? Perhaps it is better that you do not know. Remember, Zelozelos. The upper world is a gift from the Great Spirit. Perhaps someday the mice there will learn to share it. Perhaps you can teach them. Uh, Chief, exactly how do you plan to seal the tunnel? Show me the map. There. There is a great underground river here, close to the tunnel. Yeah, I remember. Once you find it again, you must destroy the wall that separates one from the other. Uh, how we supposed to do that? - Take this. - [Nervous Chuckle] Better not be a cat in here. No. Gunpowder. [Gasping] Whoa! No sweat. But you said gunpowder was evil. Mm. It is, and we would never use it to harm anyone else. But we can put it to a good use and protect ourselves. Place the box where the river's roar is loudest. Light the fuse, and then run. [Sniffling] I'll never forget you, Cholena. And I will never forget you. Farewell. Thank you. Huh-huh! Steady there, Romeo, or we all go up in smoke. Come on! [Tanya] There it is. Okay. Now all we have to do is light the gunpowder. Sure. Simple. No problem. You do it. I-I-I can't. [Screaming] Where do you think you're going? Nobody makes a fool of Scuttlebutt! Leave him be, you rat! Hey, what the- Hey! Didn't your mother ever tell ya? Kids shouldn't play with fire. You might get burned. - [Screaming] - [Grunting] [ Scuttlebutt Screaming] [Whimpering] [Both Screaming] [Screaming] Where's Philly? Oh! - [Tanya] Fievel? - [Tony] Philly? Fievel! Fievel [Sighing] [Whining] Here! Philly! Oh, Fievel! I[Papa] Fellow mice-- Fellow Americans: I am honored you should ask me... to be your negotiator with the factory owners. Thank you. All right! I hope that we and the owners can work together... to make a better future for everyone. [Crowd Cheering] Must we really make a deal with that riffraff? Well, if we don't, they all stay out on strike, and we go broke. Patience. We'll find a way to regain control. Remember, there are lots of ways to skin a cat. I beg your pardon? Uh, never mind. Eee! Move along. Oh, I just love my new job! [Chuckles] I also want to thank you, Fievel. Me, Papa? Why? Like I said. You are my inspiration. You reminded me why we came to America. You showed me how the greatest treasure... is not cheese or money .. or even wampum. No, the greatest treasure is hope-- enough hope to have a dream, and a chance to make it come true. [Crowd Cheering] I wish Cholena were here to see this. Boy, me too. I mean, yeah. I mean- Never mind, Tony. [Cheering] Here, Fievel. A little gift for my farsighted friend. Really? Wow! Thanks. I think you’ll find the view most interesting in that direction. Huh? Wow!
