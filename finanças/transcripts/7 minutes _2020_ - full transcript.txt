Thank you for this room! Kevin. Breath! Snore it! Hi, hello. Yes, dad. Everything is fine. No worries, it’s Kevin. He had an attack of hypoglycemia. But, now, everything is fine. We drank a little. We'll be going home soon. Yes, for sure. Everything is fine. I love you too dad. We'll see each other tonight. Yes, dad. Kisses. Why did you come here? I could have gone to the police station. You suffered an emotional trauma. You should be on leave for a while. I am ready to come back. I know. I know. But, you know how the police protocol works. We received the autopsy. There were traces of GHB and cocaine. Maxime died 7 minutes after Kevin. What does that change? Lots of things. A lot can happen in 7 minutes. He didn’t call for help. They were hung... with their belts. It wasn’t the drug. Maxime loved this guy. No, Jean. It’s clear. I got the video from the hotel this afternoon. - I want to see it. - Jean... I want to see it. Jean it’s tough for me. I need to keep my distance from it. Are they still in your mailbox? Show me. It’s clear that it was Kevin who led him to all this. Maxime had a job. He had friends. Jean, it’s not Kevin’s fault. They were together. They both used lots of GHB and cocaine. - Why would they do that? - I don’t know. I'll tell you: there’s no reason. Do you think your son would do this? Everything was fine. We were planning a trip to Berlin. Just him and me. What happened? - There’s something that doesn’t make sense. - The autopsy is clear. We need to investigate further. Jean, the autopsy is clear, but we can't move forward despite this seven minutes. Please, take care of yourself. I'm sorry I can't be there for you. Maybe, we could take a road trip. You, Léon, and I. It could be good. Maxime! Wait a minute, sir! Good morning. Good morning, I'm sorry to disturb you. Now isn’t a good time. What do you want? I'd like to know more about what happened to Kevin. This isn’t the place or time. The memorial will be at la Chapelle des Carmélites. We don’t have anything to tell you. Please, go! Listen, I am Maxime’s father, your son’s boyfriend. Kevin didn’t have any boyfriend. I don’t even know who Maxime is. I'd like to understand what happened between Kevin and Maxime. There’s nothing to understand. What assholes. You know you're talking about his family? Yes, I know. Did you know Kevin? Yes, I did quite well. You? If you are tired of this like everyone here, you should come to the Bisou tonight. We'll have a ceremony for him and my Maxime. It will be nice to see you there. I'm sure you'll like it. What’s the Bisou? Did you know Maxime? Come tonight and you'll see. - What? - Can we go? This is making me sick. Good evening my angel. You got here just in time. We'll start in 5 minutes. Come! Could you please give me your coat, sir? Thank you. Your ticket, sir. Good evening. Something very sad happened to us just a short time ago. Something very sad. We all knew them. Maxime didn’t like to take pictures, but, thanks to me, we have his exclusive last footage. A toast to them, to Kevin and Maxime. The Queens of Bisou. Maxime! Come on! Say something. Stop it! Please. Fuck, say something! OK, happy now? Music! Here. - Thank you, sir. Are you leaving? Yes, sorry, I can’t stay. It was very nice what you said. It was... Thank you. Wait, I'm going to play a song for you. Stay. Did you know them well? Are you sure you don’t want anything to drink? Or something else... Are you okay? You don’t look well. I'm okay, thank you. I gotta go. On Friday, I'm throwing a party. I will put you on the guest list. But to do that, I'll need your number. I never come here. Ah, you're that kind of guy! Okay, my number is 07 86... Wait, I have another idea. Get some rest. Good morning. Good morning. Is Maxime here? Come in. Please, come in. I'm not disturbing, am I? No. Is Maxime here? Where do you know him from? We know each other. Where is he? What do you want to talk to him about? Do you know when he will be back? He went on holidays... with his dad. To Berlin, I think. I'm one of his dad’s friends. For how long? I've been here many times, and no one's here. Yes, it's been a few days. How long have you known him? Longer than I've known Kevin. Is he with Maxime in Berlin? I am sorry. Kevin is dead. That’s why Maxime left. He was young. We saw it coming. Really? Why? I gotta run. - Wait! Stay a little bit more! - No, thank you. Fabien, you won’t believe it. What now? I am busy. One of your fans is outside. Which one? I don’t know. The old one. No. Yes, it’s him. Hi! Do you remember me? No. Who are you? - We met... - I'm kidding. Wanna get some coffee? I want to know what’s behind those eyes. - Here you are. - Thanks. Wait, please. - Here it is. - Thank you. Thank you. What do you do? I don’t know even your name. My name is Jacques. Jacques? You don't look like a Jacques. The truth is I'm Jean. - Jean? - Yes. I never thought I'd be saying this but, Jean is sexy. And you are Mister? Come on, Mister? I'm just Fabien. Where are you from? I'm from a very mysterious place called... Tournefeuillle. Very, very mysterious. Almost everyone I went to high school with ended up at the Bisou. It's strange we never become who we dreamt we would when we're kids. Ya know? It’s weird. What? You have the same smile as a close friend of mine. How close? I don’t know. We never know. Party friends are like that. Everything can change at once. It was Maxime. Maxime was a prince. Sometimes, I ask myself why I introduced him to Kevin. You are so cute. Hey! - What do you want? - What? With me. I don’t know. Come on, tell me your story. - Which story? - Your story. I want to hear it. You know I'm straight, right? Yes, I know. Me too. What's your job? What? You're going to make me paranoid. I'll tell you. But, it’s a secret. Tell me. I'm a writer. You are a writer? Yes. No more secrets. And you want to write about the Bisou? Yes. You shouldn’t write about the Bisou. You should write about the people who goes to the Bisou. Exactly that! I swear. You could be a psychopath. The life of a clubber? I don’t know if it’s interesting. At the same time, I've lost lots of friends. Drugs and gays are never a good mix. I'm okay, I can control myself. I see. How do you do it? Do what? Do you memorize everything? You don’t have a pen. A notebook. I get home and write it up. How about you? Aren’t you afraid you'll end up like your friends? Before you finish this book, you'll be one of us, a Bisouer. I'm certain. You'll get used to. Or you'll get me out of there! Let’s go for a walk! It's been a while since I took a walk in the daytime. Jean! Hello! How are you? My sincere condolences Jean. Thank you. Are you free? We can go for a drink. Sure, why not? Would you like to get your booster shot, sir? So, doctor, have you finally received our medication? - We are very sick. - Again? Please, follow me to the nurse's room. I will check what I can do for you. Our stock is very low. Hello, hello, how are you? Not interested, thank you. Sure dude. Hi. Yes? I'm sorry. I was an asshole. No problem. What have they taken? It’s a little early. It’s G. GHB? Do you want some? I have one, but I had a beer. I don’t want to be too fucked up. And? Don’t you know the G? It’s better not to mix it. I'd like some. Have a nice trip. If you get too high, do a line of coke. That helps. Hello guys. - Hello. You can go. Billy. Look at me. What? Am I too high? I'm in love. With that old auntie. Which old auntie? The straight guy from the other day, Jean. He's a writer. He wants to write a book about us. Okay. Not just about us, but about me. He's so cute. Okay. I think he likes me. Would you mind helping me fuck him? I can see myself already living with him in Berlin. You are handsome, young and rich... You'll soon be the old man's diva. Forever single. I want to apologize for the other day. How are you? Sometimes it’s hard for me. Can I do something to make it up? Well. If you aren’t busy. For you never. Have you started to write? Because, I need to approve everything. No problem. The first drink is on me. A gift from the Bisou. Pay attention, the second gift is a night with me. Sex on the beach. Thank you doll. A drink for the mysterious man... Who gets slowly out of the closet. You have a customer honey. Excuse me. You look calm. What did you say? You look calm. You don’t look like the cupids over there. - What have they taken? - Nothing. How do they find it? - What? - The GHB. Honey, here at the Bisou each one is his own dealer. And you and Billy? Billy? Are you guys together? Of course not. We are sisters. Let’s go dance. - Let’s go... to inspire you. - Oh no... OK, why not? Sometimes, I feel like I am in Berlin. - Berlin? - Yes at the Kit Kat club. No, it’s on me. Thank you. Thank you. You look tired today. I didn’t stop this weekend. After hours. It was intense. You should be careful. This could turn bad fast. What’s this about the G? It’s interesting. What? We talk all the time about the same thing. Why don’t you try it? Because... There are lots of different drugs out there. It depends on who you use them with. I am sure you have seen at Bisou. You can do anything except slam. Slam? To shoot it. It's way too much. It’s rare in Toulouse. Last night, I did too much. I see it. What do you see? Our life isn’t just that. It’s so much more. What do you want to write about, drugs or the Bisou? Not about the Bisou, not about the drugs. About the people who go to the Bisou. Don’t you have a boyfriend? No. I am single. Maybe you? Do you believe in destiny? I don’t know. I do. Last night, I met one of my exes, and all I thought about you. - Really? - He asked about Kevin and Maxime. He didn’t know. But, anyway, forget it. Tell me. No, another time. With you, I want to go slow. One story per date. Do you know the Bisou? Yes. It’s a club along the bank of the canal. That's where he met Kevin. Don’t you remember? No. There’s a young man there, Fabien... Sometimes, he reminds me of Maxime, and Kevin too. Maybe... You can come over and help my son. Yeah, why not? Have you been to the Bisou? No, no. No, but it’s a well-known club. I didn’t know there were regulars at nightclubs. It has been a while. It wasn’t me who was unavailable. Please Claire, take me back. What’s happening? Nothing at all. I got to go and pick up Léon. Fuck! Tonight, I want to inspire him. Yes, but, don't be too inspiring. Never. Do I inspire you? - I know how I'm going to catch him. - Really? Ta-dah! I told you. I don’t know why you insist. Straight people are the worst. I'll help you. Alex Owens? Finally, thank you. I got to work. You're the first one, who understood my outfit, I was feeling lonely. I saw the première of this film. No one came dressed up. Only the staff. What a failure. Welcome my cats. Who is going to be my lover tonight? Lights! Please! Come to mamma, Jean. Tonight, we'll pull you out of the closet. Come faster. If you take this much time to come in bed, We'll get along well. Sing with me. If you sing well, you get a gift: me. Go, Fabien. Go and do your job. Oh no, you came already. In the end, you're like the others. You deserved it. Won-der-ful! I loved your performance with Astrid. She sent me here. I felt awkward. Since you're here, would help me with these boxes? I don’t know why Billy's like that. He knows this isn’t my job. Don’t worry. I want to know everything. - You're still here? - Yes, let's dance. Are you okay? Did you get outta your G hole? Do you have a dose of G for your pals? No, I don’t. - Don’t you want to come with us? - Yes, I'm coming. Dude where were you? We've been looking for you everywhere. I called you a thousand times. I’m sorry, I couldn’t pick up. I was afraid you guys were mad at me. We're finally in Berlin. We talked with the boss. You're going to be the DJ of the Kit Kat club. It was me. It was my idea. Ah, now you. Go look for Billy. Come back! Let me do it. - Did you take too much? - I swear, I didn’t do much tonight. Something's not right. Are you fucking with me? I saw Maxime and Kevin. They're in Berlin. - Stop the bullshit. - I swear. We were at the Kit Kat Club. What happened? I was looking for you everywhere. Thanks Jean! He's at work. - What have you two done? - We didn’t do anything. - Help me. - Let’s take him to the can. Come on, let’s go! Are you sure we shouldn’t take him to the hospital? I've seen him worse off. He's going to puke up everything. If we go the hospital, we'll have cops here all week long. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Guess who’s there? - Guess who? Our dear guardian angel. - No! - Come on guys. - General Billy. - One of us passed out today... And, it wasn’t just me. - Fuck off and get out. - Come on let’s go. Welcome to Fabien’s world. Don’t drink this. What should we do? Nothing. He just needs to get some sleep. - He can stay over. - Thank you. Can you give me a ride? I have my daughter waiting for me. - We close in ten minutes. - Yes, for sure. I am sorry. I got mad. It wasn't at you, it was at Fabien. No problem. Let’s go. - To the Kit Kat? - Yes, that’s it. What a shitty night. Will this chapter be in your book? You still have energy. I’d never considered I would become a character. Aren’t you afraid that one day this could turn bad? When you smoke it's the same thing. There are people who drink, others snort. You know he doesn’t have a home. No one. He stays at the Bisou, and sometimes my place. Is here good? Yes, it’s cool. Thank you. Drive safe. And thank you for Fabien. Was it you who undressed me last night? Lots of stuff happened to you after the stockroom. You couldn't do anything. I hope you took advantage of me. You scared me. I don’t know what happened. I don’t remember. I only drank one whisky. Taste it. Hum. It's so good. Is that all for me? Thank you! You were less confusing last night. - Aren’t you hungry? - Yes. Strangely. Your house is gorgeous. Are you sure you aren’t gay? No. You are nice. Stay like this. Don’t go gay. We're all evil. Have you ever thought about changing jobs? Yes. I am working for an AA in visual marketing. Next year, I'm going back to school. I didn’t know. Very good. The truth is I'm not like the others. I know how to control myself. Where are you getting your AA? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. I know that I won't end up like the others Bisouers. Never. Last night was an accident. I don’t even like G. It’s not my drug. Do you have a drug? Not really. I don’t know I'll be a good source of inspiration for your work of art after last night. In any case, I learned my lesson. I am happy. It's better like that. I got to run. I need to start working on my AA. Don’t you want to stay a little longer? No, it’s okay. I got it. Thanks. How are you? I'm good. Are you in the coat check? Yes, it’s Wednesday night. It’s underwear party. I'm here, and Astrid's at the bar. Two euros. Underwear party? Or naked, As you wish. You piss me off. I got to go. Have some. - We look for it, and then we leave. - It will be better this way. Is someone living here? I think so. We're too high. I don’t feel comfortable. I feel Maxime. He'd have done the same thing in our place. I don't know. I knew Maxime. What did you find? No! Oh my God! Paradise! You see. I told you. Thank you, Max. I knew you wouldn’t disappoint us. Let’s take everything! - Everything? - No one else should find this. It’s for us. Let's go. Your friends are never there when you need them. Hi Jean, it’s Fabien. Sorry to bother you. I got in trouble. I was arrested with Billy. We're at the Central Station. I need you. Don't worry if you can't make it. Thank you anyway. You can release them. As you wish commander. Thank you. There’s no one here. Let’s go! - Wait! - No.
