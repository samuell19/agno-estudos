RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS STORY BEFORE. EVERYONE ELSE SPENT THE SUMMER DOING ARCHERY. I SPENT THE SUMMER LOOKING IN THE MIRROR. AND I REALIZED THIS IS IT, YOU'D BETTER MAKE THE BEST OF IT. AND EVER SINCE I HAVE MADE THE BEST OF IT. WITH ONLY A BRIEF DETOUR INTO TOTAL FOLLY, BUT LET'S LEAVE YOUR FATHER OUT OF THIS. THE POINT IS, ERICA, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE A CONVENTIONAL BEAUTY. BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE SPECIAL. I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE IT. I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY READ THAT BOOK? SHE'S READ IT SIX TIMES. OPAL, PLEASE, WOULD YOU GET OFF YOUR SISTER'S BACK? ( doorbell rings ) WHO IS IT? THE VCR REPAIR MAN, THANK GOD. WELL, YOU BE CAREFUL WITH HIM. HE STEPS ONE FOOT IN THE DOOR, IT'S A $32 MINIMUM. I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THE VCR WORKING. I HAVE TO TAPE OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTS. I HAVE TO STUDY TIMING. DELIVERY. BESIDES, IT'S A BUSINESS EXPENSE. I CAN DEDUCT IT. FROM WHAT? IT'S FATE. TOTALLY FATE. I DON'T SEE THAT. THE VCR COULD HAVE BROKEN AT ANY TIME. WHEN DOES IT BREAK? THURSDAY. SO? THE DAY BEFORE THE VCR REPAIRMAN IS GOING TO SEE HIS FIRST COUSIN, AN AGENT, SO HE CAN TELL HIM ABOUT ME, WHO HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE DAY BEFORE. WHAT'S AN AGENT? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW A ROBBER CRACKS OPEN A SAFE? WELL, AN AGENT IS SOMEONE WHO CRACKS OPEN YOUR CAREER. SO, WHO ELSE IS HE AN AGENT FOR? OH, MANY JACKIES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. SO WHY IS HE SEEING YOU? BECAUSE HIS COUSIN ASKED HIM TO. THIS IS IMPORTANT. LISTEN CAREFULLY, GIRLS. THIS IS A LIFE LESSON. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS ONLY TWO PHONE CALLS AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD. YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHO THE PHONE CALLS ARE. PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME. START. OH, RIGHT.

IS HE GONNA BE YOUR AGENT? SOME DAY. SOME DAY HE'S GOING TO BEG TO BE MY AGENT. I KNEW IT. BUT HE WAS LAUGHING. SUPPOSE DAD SEES MOM ON TV? I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST YET, OPAL. OKAY, BUT IF SHE GETS AN AGENT AND GETS FAMOUS AND BECOMES A GUEST STAR ON SOMETHING. LIKE SUPPOSE HE'S SITTING HOME ONE DAY AND WATCHING THE $25,000 PYRAMID SHOW AND SUDDENLY SEES MOM? AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERS HE HAS CHILDREN? AND COMES TO SEE US. I DON'T THINK SO, OPAL. I CAN HARDLY REMEMBER HIM. I KNOW. SOME DAYS I SCRUNCH UP MY EYES AND I CAN'T EVEN GET HIS FACE TO FLOAT INTO MY BRAIN PAN. THERE'S JUST THIS BIG BLANK SCREEN. DARLINGS, JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM. YOUR MOTHER'S THE ONE WHO KEEPS THIS WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE TOGETHER. YOUR MOTHER WORKS HER FINGERS TO THE BONE ALL WEEK LONG. In Unison: WE KNOW. WE KNOW. BUT WHAT WAS HE LIKE? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HIM AGAIN, BUT AREN'T THERE THINGS WE SHOULD KNOW? LIKE WHAT? LIKE, DID ANYONE IN HIS FAMILY HAVE DIABETES OR ANYTHING? I HAVE NO IDEA. HOW SHOULD I KNOW? YES, THERE IS DIABETES. NO, THERE ISN'T DIABETES. WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT? IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR YOUR MOTHER TO MARRY HIM. SHE ONLY MARRIED HIM TO PROVE SHE COULD GET SOMEBODY TO MARRY HER. WHO WAS SHE PROVING IT TO? HER MOTHER. HER MOTHER WAS DEAD. ONLY IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE. YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER HAD A FIGHT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING RECEPTION. ASIDE FROM THAT, IT WAS A LOVELY PARTY. $15 PER PERSON BUT WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE. ALL THEY DID WAS FIGHT. FISHKA FISHKA FOON. WHAT? THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO SAY SO WE WOULDN'T HEAR THEM FIGHTING. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. FISHKA FISHKA FOON. FISHKA FISHKA FOON. FISHKA FISHKA FOON. ERICA! FISHKA FISHKA-- ERICA, NOW LISTEN TO ME. YOU GIRLS ARE THE ONLY GOOD GOOD THING TO COME FROM THAT MARRIAGE. NOW COME HERE, MADAM FIFI. HMM-HMM. SALTY KISS. AND YOU, MY TCHOTCHKKELA. OOOO! NOW GO TO SLEEP. GOODNIGHT. HE HATED CARPETING. HE DID? I DON'T KNOW WHY I REMEMBER THAT. THE MIND IS A VERY WEIRD THING, OPAL. THERE WAS THIS DOG THAT LIVED ACROSS THE STREET NAMED TRISCUIT. AND YOU USED TO THINK THAT BOYS' PENISES LOOK LIKE TRISCUIT'S PENIS, KIND OF LIKE A CRAYOLA BUT RETRACTABLE. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT. YES, YOU DID. I DIDN'T. YES, YOU DID. I DID NOT. GOODNIGHT, OPAL. I DIDN'T THINK THAT. I DID NOT THINK THAT. I KNOW I DIDN'T THINK THAT. Erica: ANYWAY, THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE. WE WERE A NORMAL FAMILY IN OUR OWN PECULIAR WAY. HELLO. AND THEN, JUST LIKE THAT, AUNT HARRIET DIED. SHE DIED FAST. IT WAS OVER LIKE THAT. IT WASN'T A LONG AND PAINFUL DEATH. Dottie: SWEETHEART, SHE DIED IN LOEHMANN'S. SHE HAD A HEART ATTACK IN ONE OF THOSE DRESSING ROOMS WITH 29 OTHER WOMEN IN HER GIRDLE AND BRA. AND WHEN IT WAS OVER, NO ONE KNEW WHICH CLOTHES WERE HERS. THEY HAD TO DRESS HER IN NEW CLOTHES BUT THEY FORGOT TO REMOVE THOSE BIG WHITE BURGLAR TAGS, AND WHEN THEY CARRIED AUNT HARRIET OUT SHE SET OFF ALL THE STORE ALARMS. REALLY. NO. NOT REALLY. LISTEN. WE WERE ALL WRECKS. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO. BUT...BUT... WELL, EVERY PROBLEM IS AN OPPORTUNITY, ISN'T IT? I MEAN, YOU KNOW, LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS. YOUR AUNT LEFT YOU HER HOUSE SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN COMFORT. HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH? SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT YOU AND THE CHILDREN SHOULD LIVE WITHOUT DISRUPTION. IS IT 80,000? 120,000? AH, SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THAT. YOU SEE THERE'S NO MORTGAGE SO YOU'D ONLY BE PAYING THE CARRYING COST, THE HEAT, THE UTILITIES AND SO FORTH. SO I COULD SELL IT? I COULD SELL IT. I COULD TAKE THE MONEY AND I COULD SEE... WHAT? I COULD. I COULD. I COULD DO IT. I COULD DO IT. UM, HOW MUCH MORE THAN 120,000 DO YOU FIGURE? SLIGHTLY, SLIGHTLY. SLIGHTLY? SLIGHTLY? SLIGHTLY COULD BE A LOT MORE. I WANT TO PUT UP THE HOUSE FOR SALE IMMEDIATELY. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THAT? WHERE IS MY PURSE? WHERE IS MY PURSE? YOU LEFT IT IN THE CAR. SWEETHEART, DON'T CHEW YOUR HAIR. COME ON, GIRLS. COME ON. LET'S GET IN THE CAR. OKAY. FOLD ON THAT SUITCASE THERE. I GOT MY... ( mumbling ) JERK.

Erica: SHE WENT OFF TO THE COMEDY CLUB AT NIGHT. FLAPJACKS! Dottie: AT NIGHT I WENT OFF TO THIS COMEDY CLUB WHERE I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT DRINK FROM THE GLASSES. HEY, I SAID, &quot;FLAPJACKS&quot;! HOW WAS IT? HOW WAS IT? DID THEY LAUGH? DID YOU BOMB? I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO TELL. PROMISE. WHO WOULD WE TELL? WE DON'T KNOW ANYBODY. THEY LAUGHED. THEY LAUGHED AT ME.

YOU COULD GET MARRIED AGAIN. NO I COULD NOT. I'M NEVER GETTING MARRIED AGAIN. THE TRUTH IS I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE. BUT YOU LOVE US. THAT KIND OF LOVE, SURE. BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A CHILD, SURE. OKAY, WHO WANTS MORE? OH, LIGHTEN UP, ERICA. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. Erica: OKAY. IT WASN'T ALWAYS WONDERFUL. BUT IN THE BEGINNING WE FELT LIKE WE WERE A PART OF IT. YOU KNOW THE AUNT HARRIET THING WENT GREAT. WHAT AUNT HARRIET THING? I DO THIS THING ABOUT AUNT HARRIET IN HEAVEN. THAT WAS MY IDEA. WHAT DO YOU DO? WELL, YOU KNOW, AUNT HARRIET GOES TO HEAVEN AND DOES IT CHEAPER THAN ANYONE ELSE. IT'S VERY FUNNY. THAT WAS MY IDEA. WELL, WHAT ABOUT AUNT HARRIET? WHAT ABOUT HER? WHAT ABOUT HER FEELINGS? SHE'S DEAD, OPAL. PART OF BEING AN ARTIST IS USING THINGS THAT COME FROM YOUR LIFE. OH. ( overlapping conversations ) Dottie: DON'T LET ME DROP IT. I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TO CRY TONIGHT. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING HERE? CAN YOU FINISH CUTTING THE CORNBREAD? YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE BASKET OVER THERE. HOW IS IT? VERY GOOD. AUNT HARRIET'S SPECIAL DRESSING. I'M SO GLAD I'M HERE AND NOT WITH MY FAMILY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. RIGHT NOW ME AND MY SISTER WOULD BE GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR FOR MAKING FUN OF MY BROTHER'S WIFE WHO SQUINTS. HER BROTHER WOULD BE SCREAMING AT HIS KIDS AND MY MOTHER WOULD BE REPEATING MY DADS JOKES REALLY LOUD. CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND. YES, MARIANNE, PLEASE. YOU CAN TAKE THESE STRING BEANS OUT. OLIVER, I THINK WE NEED SOME MORE WINE IN THE REFRIGERATOR. DO YOU KNOW THAT LESTER'S GETTING A DIVORCE? WHY DID HE EVER GET MARRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE? AH, HE MARRIED YOUNG. IT'S EASY TO GET MARRIED YOUNG. IT'S LATER THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WHAT IF LESTER ASKED ME OUT? WHAT IF HE ASKED ME OUT? IF I SAID NO, WILL HE EVER PUT ME IN THE LINEUP AGAIN? SUPPOSE MY COMEDY CAREER IS OVER BECAUSE I TURN SOMEONE DOWN FOR A DATE? THAT WOULD BE SO IRONIC. TA-DA! GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE... YOU THINK IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR US? OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL! PLEASE HELP YOURSELF. SO I PUT ON THE HAT, I SAY, &quot;I THINK THAT I SHOULD NEVER WISH A MAMMAL NOBLER THAN THE FISH.&quot; WHICH SORT OF SETS IT UP BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT WHAT I DO ARE COUPLETS ABOUT FISH.

A FISH. &quot;ON SUBJECT ICHTHYOLOGICAL, I DON'T MEAN TO HARP, BUT WHO IS GRANDER THAN THE CARP?&quot; IT'S A GOOD ONE. YOU DO KNOW WHAT A CARP IS? SURE. A CARP IS A GOLDFISH THAT COMPLAINS A LOT. ANYTHING SHE SAYS BELONGS TO ME. SEE MY PROBLEM IS I DON'T BELONG IN A COMEDY CLUB. I'M TOO SOPHISTICATED FOR THAT. THEY WANT SET UP, PUNCH. SET UP, PUNCH. SET UP, PUNCH. HERE'S THE HIDEOUS THING. SKIP &quot;THE LOON&quot; TYLER GOT AN AGENT. SKIP &quot;THE LOON&quot;? YES, HE DID. HE STINKS. HE DOES MY MATERIAL. MORTY BASHES IS HIS AGENT. DOES HE HAVE A CONTRACT? NO. HE DOESN'T HAVE PAPER IN HIS OFFICE. THAT'S A RUMOR. MORTY BASHES IS HIS UNCLE. THAT DOESN'T COUNT. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS ARE SO HUNG UP ABOUT AGENTS. I HAD AN AGENT FOR FOUR YEARS.

SHE'S GONNA TICKLE YOUR HEART AND BREAK YOU FUNNY BONE. PLEASE WELCOME DOTTIE ENGELS. ( applause ) THANK YOU, LESTER. THANK YOU. OKAY, THIS IS MY LIFE. UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO, I WAS WORKING THE MAKEUP COUNTER AT THE MACY'S ON QUEENS BOULEVARD. NOW, I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS, BUT I HAVE ACTUALLY CONVINCED A WOMAN TO BUY PLACENTA CREAM. ( laughter ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS, DO YOU? I MEAN, I KNOW HOW THEY INVENTED A GRILLED STEAK. A PIECE OF MEAT FELL INTO THE FIRE. BUT HOW DID THEY FIND OUT THAT PUTTING PLACENTAS ON YOUR FACE MADE YOU LOOK YOUNGER. I CAN'T IMAGINE. SOMEWHERE IN THIS WORLD THERE'S A 90-YEAR-OLD OBSTETRICIAN WHO LOOKS LIKE 20. RIGHT? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? IT'S A GIRL. IT'S A GIRL. AND I LOOK STUNNING. ( laughter and applause ) Erica: THE FIRST NIGHT I SAW MY MOM PERFORM I WAS THE MOST NERVOUS I EVER WAS IN MY LIFE. BUT SHE GOT UP AND SHE WAS SO FUNNY, AND EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. IT WAS MY MOM UP THERE. I MEAN, I KNEW IT WAS MY MOM, BUT IT WASN'T. IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS SOMEONE ELSE, TOO. ( laughter continues ) ST. PETER, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. I'VE HEARD-- I'VE HEARD I'M HAPPY TO SAY... Dottie: THE NIGHT I MET ARNOLD MOSS, WHAT CAN I SAY? IT WAS LIKE MEETING ELVIS, OR BRANDO, OR ORSON WELLES, OR SOME OTHER HUGE LEGENDARY FIGURE. HE WAS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WITH CLAUDIA AND THE GIRLS WERE THERE, AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I MEAN, ONE MINUTE I'M AUDITIONING FOR THESE BRILL BUILDING LOWLIFES AND SIX MONTHS LATER, I'M ON STAGE AND ARNOLD MOSS IS WATCHING ME. ( laughter ) THIS IS ALSO NOT MY LIFE. AS A RULE I DON'T BREAST-FEED IN RESTAURANTS. CALL ME CRAZY. &quot;THE LA LECHE LEAGUE.&quot; HAVE YOU MET THESE WOMEN? THEY THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BREAST-FEED YOUR KID UNTIL HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO UNBUTTON YOUR BLOUSE. THEY LOVE IT. I'M BONDING WITH MY BABY. THE BABY IS 48 YEARS OLD AND OPENING A DAIRY QUEEN. ( laughter and applause ) MOM, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU WERE SWELL. MOM, YOU WERE GREAT. YOU KILLED THEM. I'M SO GLAD YOU LIKED IT. SHE'S GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER IN L.A. ARNOLD MOSS. HI. EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. IT JUST HAPPENED. WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE? SHE'S GOING TO BE IN THE FAMOUS COMEDY SHOP ON THE FAMOUS SUNSET STRIP. MOM? LOOK, LET HER TALK TO ARNOLD MOSS. WHEN ARE WE GOING? IT'S NOT A TRIP FOR CHILDREN. MOM? MOM, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO L.A.? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE WON'T BE IN THE WAY. I PROMISE. CHILDREN DO NOT LEAVE SCHOOL WHEN THEIR MOTHERS GO ON SHORT BUSINESS TRIPS. IT'S NOT SHORT. IT IS, TOO. IT'S THREE WEEKS. OPAL, SHE IS GOING TO PERFORM AT THE FAMOUS COMEDY SHOP ON THE FAMOUS SUNSET STRIP. BIG DEAL. IT IS A BIG DEAL. AND THEY'RE PAYING HER. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US. ARNOLD MOSS SAYS THAT IF THIS WORKS... MOM, HE EATS PAPER. HE DOES? HE ATE A WHOLE NAPKIN. HE DID? THE PEDIATRICIANS NUMBER IS ON THE WALL ABOVE THE PHONE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO OLD FOR A PEDIATRICIAN, ERICA? I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT WHEN I GET BACK. THE BATHROOM DOOR DOESN'T SHUT. GET THE SUPER TO FIX THAT. ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE REAL DIFFERENCE IN WHERE YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK IS YOUR BATHROOM DOOR. ON THE EAST SIDE THEY SHUT. ON THE WEST SIDE THEY DON'T. AND DOWNTOWN THERE ARE NONE. THEY WOULDN'T GET THAT IN L.A. ANYWAY, IT'S NOT VERY GOOD. YEAH, YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT. I TOLD THE BABY-SITTERS YOU HATE MAYONNAISE. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. IF YOU DON'T WATER THE PLANTS I DON'T CARE. EAT SOME BREAKFAST, OKAY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELVES WITH OAT BRAN. OPAL, CAN YOU GET THESE OUT OF MY PURSE, PLEASE?

MURPHY AND ASK HIM TO PHONE IN A PRESCRIPTION TO THE ALL-NIGHT PHARMACY? Erica: AND THEN CAME DENNIS, WHO WAS NO LONGER WRITING COUPLETS ABOUT FISH. WHAT IS IT ABOUT LAWRENCE WELK THAT BRINGS TO MIND THE DAINTY ELK? YOU'RE KIDDING? HE WAS IN THE AUDIENCE? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. OPAL, GET ON THE PHONE. YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS. HI, MOM. HI, SWEETHEART. AND THEN HE CAME BACK STAGE AND HE SAID, &quot;I LOVE YOUR WORK&quot;. STEVE MARTIN LOVES MY WORK. WHAT WAS HE LIKE? I HAVE NO IDEA. THAT WAS THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. FOUR WORDS. THEN I SAID, &quot;WHAT?&quot;. SO THAT'S ONE MORE WORD. BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? IT'S HAPPENING, SWEETHEARTS. IT'S REALLY HAPPENING. I'M NOT CRAZY. IT'S LIKE A DREAM. IT'S SO GREAT, MOM. WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME? I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL SO I WANTED TO STAY OUT HERE A LITTLE LONGER THAN I WAS GOING TO. HOW MUCH LONGER? JUST TWO MORE WEEKS, SWEETPEAS. I LOVE YOU. PLEASE SAY IT'S ALL RIGHT. TWO MORE WEEKS? I'LL BRING YOU... WHAT CAN I BRING YOU? I DON'T KNOW. MOM, GOD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRIBE US. IT'S OKAY. OH, YOU'RE TERRIFIC. YOU ARE TWO TERRIFIC GIRLS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I MISS YOU. YEAH, WE MISS YOU, TOO. ( drumroll sounds off and applause ) WHERE IS MY PURSE? WHERE-- IS THIS NOT WHAT HAPPENS? I MEAN, DO YOU EVER KNOW... Dottie: AFTER A WHILE, DOING STANDUP STARTS TO FEEL FAMILIAR, EVEN ROUTINE. FIRST, IT'S THE SWEATY PALM PHASE. FOLLOWED BY THE I CAN'T DO IT, I'M NAUSEOUS, I'M GOING TO THROW-UP PHASE. FOLLOWED BY HEY, I'M DOING IT. FOLLOWED BY, I AM THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH! THAT PHASE IS THE BEST PHASE. YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS SECRETLY WANTED SOMEONE TO SNATCH THIS BABY. ( laughter ) &quot;HEY LADY, HAND OVER YOUR PURSE&quot;. ( laughter and applause ) Dottie: ARNOLD MOSS WAS HERE LAST NIGHT. THE SPONGY BOG WAS THERE. YUCK. HE TOOK ME OUT TO DINNER AND WHEN IT WAS OVER HE ATE THE BILL. WHAT? HE TOOK HER TO DINNER AND HE ATE THE BILL. HE DID. JUST KIDDING. I SWEAR TO GOD. Erica: THE NEXT BABY-SITTER WE HAD WAS MIA. SHE STIR FRIES EVERYTHING. AND SHE TOOK US TO AN ABORTION RALLY AND WE ALL DRESSED UP AS SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR. MIA HAS THIS THEORY THAT ALL GIRLS ARE EITHER BETTY OR VERONICA. WHO WILL BE MY MYSTERY DATE? TURN THE KNOB. OH, MY GOD, I GOT THE DUD AGAIN. I ALWAYS GET THE DUD. IT'S JUST A GAME. DO YOU THINK MOM DATES? SHE WOULDN'T. SHE WOULD NEVER. WHY DON'T YOU PLAY MYSTERY DATE WITH US? I ALWAYS GET DREAM DATE, BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND. HERE I GO. I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM! I GOT DREAM DATE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT! I'M SO JEALOUS. EAT YOUR HEART OUT. IF YOU ALWAYS LAND ON DREAM DATE THEN YOU MUST BE VERONICA. ERICA, OPAL, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND. IS IT A LIFE LESSON? DEFINITELY. VERONICA ALWAYS GETS THE GUY. OR WHATEVER SHE WANTS. AND BETTY ALWAYS WANTS WHATEVER VERONICA GETS. I'M VERONICA. I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES ME BETTY? OH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT IT. YOU, MY ERICA, ARE A LOVER OF MISERY. IT'S MY TURN TO GO FIRST. ARE YOU A BETTY OR A VERONICA FOREVER? NO. A BETTY CAN GROW UP TO BE A VERONICA. LOOK AT YOUR MOM. WHO WANTS TOFU PUFFS? OPAL, GET OUT OF THE WAY! OH, MY GOD, IT'S STILL A COMMERCIAL. THIS IS IT. PLEASE, GOD, MAKE IT BE ALL RIGHT.

WELL, I'VE EATEN MY LAST CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD FOR A MONTH... Erica: REVOLTING. SHE WAS COMPLETELY REVOLTING. AND HER DOTS WERE GETTING BIGGER. ALSO, AND THIS IS REALLY PATHETIC, SHE LOST THE ABILITY TO BE ALONE. SHE TOOK CLAUDIA EVERYWHERE. CLAUDIA WAS LIKE TONTO. IF YOU WERE A MAN, WOULD YOU THINK I HAD CAPPED TEETH? DO YOU REALLY? FOUR. REALLY? WELL, SIX ACTUALLY. Dottie: I SHOULD SAY THAT I COULD NEVER EVER HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THOSE EARLIER DAYS AS A PERFORMER WITHOUT CLAUDIA CURTIS. SHE WAS MORE THAN AN AGENT. SHE WAS A FRIEND.

KEEP THE CHANGE. WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS HOLD HER BREAST LIKE THAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID THEY MIGHT ESCAPE. Dottie: SUPPOSE I DO THIS COMMERCIAL, AND FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I'M KNOWN AS &quot;MISS COUNTRY CHICKEN&quot;. Claudia: IF YOU WERE JUST GOING TO BE A CHICKEN, I'D SAY DON'T TOUCH IT WITH A 10-FOOT POLE. BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE ABOUT YOU THAN IT IS ABOUT CHICKEN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. SWEETHEART, WOULD YOU MAKE YOUR MOTHER HAPPY AND AT LEAST LOOK LIKE YOU'RE EATING? WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VISIBILITY. AND MONEY. I MEAN, WHO ARE WE KIDDING? I HEARD THAT IF YOU EVEN JUST HAVE YOU HAND IN A COMMERCIAL, YOU CAN MAKE A FORTUNE. LIKE YOU CAN GET RICH JUST OFF YOUR KNEE. WHAT'S WRONG, ERICA? NOTHING. Opal: CAN WE COME WHEN YOU MAKE THE COMMERCIAL, MOM? I DON'T KNOW. CLAUDIA, CAN THEY? SURE. YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG? YES. LAST MONTH, WHEN MY CLASS DID FRANZ KAFKA NIGHT, YOU DIDN'T COME. AND NOW, YOU JUST CONVENIENTLY MAKE IT TO OPAL'S PERFORMANCE. HONEY, LAST MONTH I WAS IN L.A. I COULDN'T HAVE COME. YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE COME IF I COULD HAVE. WE TALKED ABOUT IT. DIDN'T WE TALK ABOUT IT? SHE WASN'T EVEN IN THE PLAY. SHE WAS IN THE LIGHTING BOOTH. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING ELSE?

YOU KNOW, IT REALLY WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HER TO BRING CLAUDIA TO YOUR SHOW. AFTER ALL, CLAUDIA IS NOT A RELATIVE AND THAT'S REALLY WHO SHOULD BE AT YOUR CHILD'S PERFORMANCE. WHY CAN'T MOM BE A REGULAR MOM, THE WAY SHE WAS BEFORE? MOM WAS NEVER A REGULAR MOM. BUT SHE MADE FLAPJACKS. REGULAR MOMS DON'T MAKE FLAPJACKS. THEY MAKE PANCAKES. Erica: AND REGULAR MOMS DON'T GO OFF TO LOS ANGELES JUST AS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. HI, JORDAN. HI. SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE HAVING A FAMOUS MOTHER? SHE'S NOT FAMOUS. I SAW HER ON HBO LAST WEEK. SHE'S FUNNY. SHE'S REALLY VERY FUNNY. DOES SHE ALWAYS WEAR THOSE DOTS? WHY? I-- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WAS WONDERING. DOES SHE WEAR THEM TO SLEEP? SHE WEARS THEM EVERYWHERE.

WON'T NORM BE SURPRISED. ( dialing phone ) NORM? HI. I'VE GOT A BIG SURPRISE FOR YOU. YOUR GIRLS ARE HERE. Whispering: ERICA AND OPAL. NO KIDDING. OKAY. HE WAS REAL SURPRISED. HE'LL BE HERE IN TWO SHAKES. WHAT DOES HE DO? OH, DEAR. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE DOES? HE'S A MIDDLEMAN, AND TO TELL THE TRUTH, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS, EXCEPT IT DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH FRUIT. YOU MEAN HE GETS A BUNCH OF APPLES FROM SOMEPLACE AND GETS THEM TO A AND P? MAYBE. HE TOLD ME A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT IT JUST FLEW RIGHT OUT OF MY HEAD. HON, JUST THE OTHER DAY. I WAS READING THIS ARTICLE IN PEOPLE MAGAZINE ABOUT THAT MAN WHO MURDERED HIS ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING THE GRANDMA 18 YEARS AGO, THEN HE WENT OFF, GOT MARRIED AGAIN.

I REALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THEM. I MEAN, I DID THINK ABOUT THEM. IN THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME. I SPENT 16 YEARS DOING NOTHING BUT THINKING ABOUT THEM AND NOW I SPENT THREE MONTHS THINKING ABOUT MYSELF AND I FEEL LIKE I MURDERED THEM. YOU HAD TO TRAVEL, IT'S PART OF WORK. LOOK, KIDS ARE HAPPY WHEN THEIR MOTHER IS HAPPY. NO, THEY'RE NOT. EVERYONE SAYS THAT, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. KIDS ARE HAPPY IF YOU'RE THERE. YOU GIVE KIDS A CHOICE, YOUR MOTHER IN THE NEXT ROOM ON THE VERGE OF SUICIDE VERSUS YOUR MOTHER IN HAWAII IN ECSTASY, THEY CHOOSE SUICIDE IN THE NEXT ROOM, BELIEVE ME. DID YOU EVER SEE IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE? SURE. IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY WHO HAS DREAMS, HE WANTS TO TRAVEL, HE WANTS TO BUILD BRIDGES, BUT IN THE END WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S BETTER OFF BECAUSE HE NEVER DID ANY OF IT? NOW, THAT'S ALL CRAP. IT'S CRAP. I LOVE THAT MOVIE. WELL, IT'S TOTAL CRAP. THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT MOVIE IS SAYING. IT'S SAYING IF A PERSON STAYS HOME, THEY CAN MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO ARE NEAR TO THEM. IF IT WEREN'T FOR JIMMY STEWART, HIS BROTHER WOULD HAVE DIED. THE PHARMACIST WOULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL, HIS CHILDREN... HE NEVER EVER WOULD HAVE HAD HIS CHILDREN. HIS CHILDREN NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN. WHAT PHARMACIST? THERE'S A PHARMACIST. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY PHARMACIST. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? ( tires screeching ) DID, AH, SOMETHING HAPPEN TO YOUR MOTHER? SHE'S A COMEDIAN. BUT IS SHE ALL RIGHT? IS SHE SICK OR ANYTHING? NO.

I DON'T SEE WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT IT. LOOK, I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT DOTTIE'S RUN OFF TO BE IN SHOW BUSINESS. THAT'S ALL SHE CARED ABOUT. THAT'S NOT ALL SHE CARED ABOUT. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
