Nobody was really killed, nothing was really stolen. That's what's so evil about it. Danny, this is a criminal investigation. Stick to the facts. Okay. Why don't you tell us about Levi Mattson. When we were kids, he lived across the street. Who lives there now? A man they call, Brick. And this girl they call, Preacher Boy, and a rude kid. Forget what they call him. It's a whole cult. Preacher Boy is a girl? I think so, yes. I don't know exactly. Did you witness any abuse? Was it devil-worship? Okay, fine. Tell us first what happened with Casey. Was there, some sort of sexual attraction? Me and Casey? [BARFING] They poisoned me. Danny, he's of legal age.

That little son of a bitch has the nerve to park right in front of my house. He took the bricks right out of my god damn yard. Oh, yeah? He zipped across my yard, hit behind that bush, and zipped out to the middle of the street and threw it like this here, like a god damn quarterback. You say he zipped. Zipped, zipped. Uh, after he threw the brick, did he zip back to his car? That little son of a bitch zipped his ass. Thank you, Miss Nancy. We really appreciate your looking out for us. Thank you. Miss Nancy.

BRICK: Yeah, that's good enough for today, let's go. Don't forget your cap. WOMAN: You can't make yourself happy with your stuff. What we think of as our life Tadpole, you're late. WOMAN: What we think of as our life is actually just a series of events and how we are affected by them. That effect is influenced by our beliefs and thoughts. When you change what is inside the outside also changes. This is is a basic law of nature, just like gravity. MAN: You're going to hell. I see we have a prophet in the crowd. Yeah, yeah. Bible says that you and all your little faggot friends are going to hell. Thank you for the warning. You're welcome. I'll look for that verse. For the record, I think it's fine to believe in a book, as long as it's one that you've read. MAN: Whatever, fag. It's time for our top ten list. Today's topic is how to be a miserable fuck. [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] This is an important part of life in America so listen up. Number one. Believe everything you hear. Especially if it's on TV. Number two. Never be original. Just copy what everyone else is doing, it's much easier. Number three. Spend a great deal of energy destroying everything and everyone that you don't understand, ostracizing anyone who's different than you. If you can arrest or kill them, even better. This will guarantee a dull, safe world for us all. WOMAN: Number four. Don't learn from history. It's much easier to wallow in a destructive shithole and call it tradition. Number five. Never ever take responsibility for your own actions. Be sure and teach this to your children and blame the schools, the government, and the movies. Number six. Grab and protect what is rightfully yours and never share it. Number seven. Always remember the mean things people say and do to you. See ya later! Replay these scenes over and over in your head and try to feel as hurt as you can. It feels bad but it is at least predictable. Number eight. Eat and drink everything you crave, and buy your children candy every day. And load up on chips and sodas. Number nine. You must believe in a cruel and angry God that judges everyone by a set of rules that are impossible to live by, and punishes us when we can't follow them. Make sure your God is a man, too, no girly gods allowed. Make sure he hates certain people but loves people just like you. Make sure he has picked some special, chosen person to tell you how to think and live. Number ten. Drumroll. Buy lots of stuff! Get everything you want right now! Don't worry if you need it or have any money for it, just get it and get it now. If you follow these simple ten commandments of misery, you will not only make your own life into a living nightmare, but you will spread this until the entire Earth becomes a dark and dangerous place. Just like the almighty man, God said it would be. Thank you for listening and not calling the cops. I will be gone next week, but will return at the same time the following week. Good day. [LETHARGIC CLAPPING] Casey, what's with the fucking camera? Tadpole. Jesus. Did you see that crowd? Bunch of idiots. Now you understand why I do it? It's not wrong to have a gift.

You mentioned something about a crossdress. Do you mean like a dress with a cross on it? He means you dress like a boy. Yeah, all the dudes dress like chicks and the chicks dress like dudes.

[SLOW ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] CASEY: When I moved here at age 13, I started hearing stories about how Danny Williams caused my father's death. And when The Tribe started dumpster diving, recycling, and having frequent yard sales, he called the cops on us almost every day. Um, well he was 16 when I was born so that's TADPOLE: Thirty-four. CASEY: Yeah. TAD: So, he should definitely know how to wash a car. I mean, look at it. I should go over there and wash it. CASEY: Maybe he could pay you. TAD: Ah, dude, yeah. I think that's how I'll ask him to be in my film. Hey, man TADPOLE: What is he doing? [LAUGHTER] TAD: Oh, my God. CASEY: I need to make this one. I, just, here, take this. TAD: Okay. TAD: What are we doing? What are you gonna' do? CASEY: I'm just gonna', you know. See if I can, pull his clothes off. TAD: Oh, I see I see his wick rick! I see his wicker! Oh, my God. CASEY: Shh. Gotta' concentrate, come on. TAD: Sorry. TAD: Dude. We gotta' get it all the way down. Take his pants all the way down. Please? I need the money shot. I need the money shot. CASEY: Okay. TAD: Goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'. [SNICKERING AND LAUGHING] CASEY: Oh, oh no. TAD: He's getting it in his face, oh, my god. [LAUGHING TO THEMSELVES] TAD: Hey, Danny. About five years ago or so I did some pro bono counseling at a children's home in Dallas County. I met Lisa Mattson who was looking for a particular child, and she adopted him with my help. I later moved here, because I started dating her son, Levi, and we've lived here ever since. [PEN CLICKS] All right, um. What do you know about these cult leaders? They go by the aliases, Preacher Boy and Brick? Cult leaders, really? Indulge me. Preacher Boy and Ted Polk came from the same children's home as Casey and Brick said once he used to work on Wall Street but I don't know anything else about him. Never got a name on a document? No, it was all very informal, just after Lisa died. Why do you think he goes by a fake name? Tim, all the kids have nicknames, and, uh, Mighty Casey loves baseball and the poem and Tadpole is small and defenseless, and Streak, as you well know, runs naked through the Fourth of July parade. Every year since puberty. [LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND] What about this cult group? I've got a dozen complaints from families that say their kids are running off with this guy. Well, I think it's more like a club of misfits all the same age. We are tribal by nature and young people especially just want to belong to a group. They want to be loved. I think these complaints you're getting are completely unfounded. I have a list of names here. The Grand Jury will be meeting on this next week to determine if it's kidnapping or not. If it is, charges will be brought. At the very least, it's a missing persons case. I also have a statement about the amount of blood found in the home, along with the video evidence provided by Dan Williams. Which will also be read by the Grand Jury. It's a case of murder, or attempted one. And this document is about three fugitives from justice in the company of your boyfriend's 18 year old nephew, which may also be named as an accomplice. That sounded like a threat. I believe you know where they are. What will you do then? We will apprehend the fugitives, have a few words with this Brick fellow, and confirm the safety of all the members of this little club of misfits. Could I have a drink of water? Certainly. [BASEBALL GAME ON RADIO] STREAK: What's the score? CASEY: No score. STREAK: You sign with anybody yet? CASEY: They tried to give me a car. And a lot of money, from the way Levi was screaming. STREAK: You didn't take it. You're lying or you're stupid. [BASEBALL GAME ON RADIO] Sure was a nice car. Yeah, it was. CASEY: I didn't sign with anybody. What team is he with? It doesn't matter. You know, baseball was Levi's idea on helping me focus. I never wanted to be good at it. I just wanted to stop making shit fly around the room every time I had a stray thought. [BASEBALL GAME ON RADIO] The Rangers do need a good pitcher. Man, that was a nice car. Guys, guys, you gotta' film me, you gotta film me! CASEY: It's tape, not film. What's up? I just caught that girl over there stealing! So what? This stuff isn't ours anyway, remember, we found it. Come on, please? I just wanna get it on tape. Please, Casey, Please. Zoom in from here. I'm listening to the game. It'll just take a second, I'll show you. Who is she? I don't know. I've never seen her before. I'll do it. Is it okay, MC? Yeah. Okay, go go. Come on, you ready? Watch this. [BASEBALL GAME ON RADIO] Do you need any help? No, I'm just looking at things. Okay. You're not from around here, are you? No. My name's Tadpole. That's a stupid name. Hey, uh, do you want me to put some of that stuff on the counter for you while you shop? No, I'm just looking, really. Okay, well, I mean, I thought I'd just be a little uncomfortable with all that shit crammed up your shirt. Look, you little shit. Back off. Okay, okay. I just wanted you to know about our policy, you know, we don't really believe in stealing. So, if you really want it, you can have it, I mean, the way we look at it, this stuff isn't really ours. This thing, I don't even, I don't even know where I got that, you know? So I mean, if you really want it, you can just take it, you don't have to be secret about it. I was just, you know, I was thinking Hey, what's going on over here? Whoa, that is a cool tattoo. What kind of fun is that? Don't touch me. Okay. This little shit accused me of stealing. Hey, we don't steal, man. Well, I mean, hey. That's what I was telling the girl with the CD stuff crammed up her shirt. Why don't you shut up. Hey, sir. You listen here. If you're gonna' hit me, I like to be hit and fucked at the same time. Feels really good when they're together. It's called synergy. The fuck is wrong with you, boy. Oh, come on. I know you have fond memories of prison rape. Hey, look, I'm gonna' give you one chance to apologize for that little mouth of yours. You understand me. Does this mean you're not gonna' fuck me? LADY: Kick his ass, baby. Please. LADY: Oh. Hit him again. That was awesome, okay. What's up, where you going, punk? [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GROANS IN PAIN] ONLOOKER: Go, Preacher!

STEALING WOMAN: Cut a piece of his throat. You know, we waste so much time trying to rearrange the world to serve us but it's exactly the other way around. [SHIRTLESS MAN SWEARING] [CLUTTERS] You motherfuckers are dead, all of them. You son of a bitches. This is bullshit. You all are dead. We're gonna' be back. We'll be fucking back. STEALING WOMAN: Fucking weirdos. Danny came to see me one time in my private practice, a few years ago, but he never came back. Why not? I don't know. Is that all? Well, I know he carries a lot of guilt and shame. About Eli. About everything. Do you have any idea what they did to him at that place? It is a reputable facility. Then you're terribly misinformed. Danny Williams claims that something evil was going on in that house. And then he gives us a tape that shows, amongst other obscene things, an apparent gunfight. And you believe him? I wasn't there. I wanna' tell you about that video. Okay. Casey and his friends were very creative, and inventive, and they did some tricks with the camera. They told me all about it and Levi and I played along. I hope you're not taking this too seriously. It was just camera tricks. You could see that everybody walked away uninjured. Uh, yeah, well, we have watched the tape, but there... I would like the camera and the tapes back. Don't make me file a lawsuit over this. [SIGHS] I can give you the camera, but the tapes are evidence. Evidence of what? The joke of a crazy man that went too far? It is clear to me that blood was shed. Do you even have any DNA matches? Was it even human blood? I know your county budget. So don't even pretend you spent thousands doing a blood analysis. We can have it tested. Oh, come on. You drive your own cars with lights and sirens you bought on Ebay. This is one of the poorest and I mean poorest counties on the map. I need the three armed robbery suspects. And I need Brick. And I also need to make sure that these kids are safe. Tim, this is just a hoax by some kids. Don't embarrass yourself over this. Just tell me where they are and I will make sure this is all done fair. Thank you, Detective, I'm leaving now, and I can pick up the camera at the front desk? I'll need the cell phones too. We can release them. MAN: Uh, okay. I'll bring them to the front. [ 45 PLAYING] The fuck is going on here, my fucking radio dispatcher all freaking out saying goddamn Sodom and Gomorrah, fucking shit raining down from the goddamn sky, what the fuck. You can't just make shit up, Danny, and have someone arrested for it. What did he do? He's evil! I saw the hand of Satan at work! He says that shit went flying through the air and... I know what he fucking said. Who the fuck hit you? Nobody. It was an accident. Levi, you've got the wrong man in handcuffs. I just put him in handcuffs till you got here. That one, right there, pulled down his pants and flashed his privates. What he's saying just... You heard me, I didn't fucking stutter. DANNY: He is a son of Satan. Enough out of you. [DANNY YELLING] BRICK: Can I say something, Officer? LEVI: No! Come by our meeting tonight. Find out what we're all about. LEVI: Why the fuck would I do that? I want you to arrest him for indecency. BRICK: Because the best way to forgive someone is to sit down with them. I saw his penis, plain as day. I saw his penis. Miss Nancy, will you please, shut the hell up and go home. Don't you talk down to me. I remember when you used to jack off under the Conley Bridge. ♪ I'm dieing I don't have anyone to forgive, all right? CASEY: I do. I want you to be there. ♪ Nice and dry ♪ Will you come to my birthday party tonight? Me? CASEY: Yeah. Why? BRICK: If you come by for a few minutes, we'll never have another yard sale. Ever. Okay. I guess. It's my birthday. Fine then. What time? Nine. All right, tell me the truth. Little burger thing, mini burger thing, did it get broken during all this shit? Shit! Fuck! I wanted that! LEVI: When I come back here, this shit better be fucking clean! We are here, live, on this horrific and horrible scene. Ma'am, can you tell us what happened? Thanks, Casey. All I gotta' say is thanks for the mess, Casey. [CLEARS THROAT] TAD: Any, anybody. Sir, can you give us your official statement. There is no proof to any of these charges that I caused this mess. I'm innocent until proven guilty. Don't talk to the press. Okay, uh, can you tell us about the conspiracy surrounding the events today? We have no comment. We believe this was a natural phenomenon. You, sir. Is it true that the sky is falling like everybody's claiming? I believe the sky's angry at us, that's why it sent this debris. A warning. Okay. Uh, thank you. CASEY: Brick said he read about me in the newspaper when he lived in New York City. He knew enough about the mathematics of baseball to figure something was up. He was looking for somebody with the same gift he has, so he cashed in his stocks and moved here. He became my mentor and friend. I still don't know what he does to the water.

We're not separate and isolated from the universe. Recycle, volunteer, give things away. We're self-reliant. Poverty and hunger are a shared problem. Knowledge is a valued commodity that is exchanged freely. Discussions and differences of opinion make for a balanced Tribe. People that are different are welcome and encouraged. Never burden the government with something that the Tribe can handle. ALL: Streak. [CLAPPING] All right, my tribe name is Bean. ALL: Bean.

[CLAPPING] Instead of throwing things away, it's better to put them to a new use. Nature does this. So, Levi, how have you been? What do you want, Tim? I need to know about that day, couple of weeks ago. What about it? Levi, your blood was found splattered all over your mother's house. How did your blood get on the walls and the floor? I don't remember. Do you remember what happened to all those kids there that morning? Did you know that tiny subatomic particles can be in two places at the same time? Levi. This is a dangerous man. You said it yourself. He could've brainwashed these kids and God knows what could happen. And now, he's got three dangerous criminals with him. We need to find this guy. If I could explain it to you, I would. Really. What happened to you, Levi? I already told you, Tim. Me and Sharon went to Mexico like we planned. I came back, turned in my badge, and went home. Don't you think it's odd that a dozen teenagers who just put all their cell phones in a pile would head off on some vacation trip camping? Don't you think it's odd that a stolen car is returned to its owner? With an apology note? Even stranger that an investigation would continue after the money's been paid back and the charges dropped. C'mon, Tim. How much are they paying you to find him? The agents? What do you mean? I know they wanna' find Casey. They got a multi-million dollar contract right down there. They offered me a generous finder's fee. How much, Tim? You can tell me. Thank you, Levi. You can go now. Instead of throwing things away, it's much smarter to try to put things to a new use. Nature does this. Admit what went wrong, forgive everybody including yourself, and turn waste into a meaningful experience. [CHAIR LEGS SQUEAK] Oh, man. That was so weird. Tim. So, there's not like, anyone actually, like, really paying you, is there? Don't be stupid, Ray. They just want to talk to me. That's it. [TIM BEGINS YELLING TO HIMSELF] I'm happy you're being normal.

But if there's not at least a grand in there, I'm gonna' come back, and I'm gonna burn this place to the ground. With all of you in it. John, keep these nice folks under wraps till I get back. I, where's your gun? It's in the car. What the fuck? [GIRL SCREAMS] [PUNCHING] [GUNSHOTS] [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] [GIRL SCREAMS] Get back! Back off! CASEY: What was that noise? BRICK: Bus runs great. Casey, it would be a great time to use that gift. CASEY: I can't, you do it. Come on, Casey, focus. Remember the baseball coming towards you. Focus, swing, connect. Home run. I knew you could do it, Casey. Tadpole. Hey, shssh. Do not be afraid of him. Tadpole. You are not hurt. Get up. Casey, it's your turn. Help these people up. BRICK: What is it that you want? CASEY: Focus and connect. BRICK: Did you come for money? Yeah, motherfucker, all of it! Tadpole, go get the money. TAD: All of it? Really? Casey, these people are hurt. They need your help Focus. CASEY: Focus and connect. BRICK: How much is there? TAD: Three-hundred and twenty-five thousand. Give it to Jack. Casey, your uncle, Levi's hurt real bad. JACK: I never told you my name. BRICK: No, you didn't. CASEY: Uncle Levi. BRICK: It's not even your real name. You just like the sound of Jack and Jill. BRICK: Jack fell down and broke his crown, remember? Now what else do you want? What the fuck is going on here? You've got your money. Now what else do you want? BRICK: Think about it, Jack. What do you want more than anything else in the world? JACK: Who are you? I am, you, only slightly rearranged, with different molecules and experiences. BRICK: Hey. [LAUGHS] What happened to breakfast? Let's eat, come on. VOICE FROM RADIO: About a zombie, okay? VOICE FROM RADIO: Oh, a knowledge mummy taking center wood. [CLINKING OF DISHES] [INCOHERENT CHATTER ON RADIO] BRICK: Are you hungry? There's plenty. That gun won't work. Casey melted the firing pin in it. He can do that. BRICK: We're going on a little trip. You can all come if you want. JILL: I wanna' come. JOHN: Hey, yeah, me too. If I come with you, will you turn me in? BRICK: No, I won't. But it means we can't come back for a while. The Tribe have to vote on it. We can't take our car, they'll be looking for us. STREAK: We bought a huge bus, and it's, uh, real big. Our car's stolen. We stole a lot of things. BRICK: I have a suggestion about that. What if you abandon everything you've ever taken? And then what if, you paid back all the money you'd ever stolen? JOHN: Well, they would arrest us, then. BRICK: Send it by mail. Write an apology note. LEVI: Hey. JACK: There's over 300,000 dollars in here. I may be a smartass, but I don't lie. Well, if we're gonna' go on this long trip, I'm gonna need some new clothes, a fresh, clean new pair of clothes. Yeah, we'll actually all need new clothes. And food. I will get the canned goods, we're probably going to need some rations. There's some crates in the garage, I'll go get those. I'll get the chickens. Why are you doing this? When I was a little boy, I had this gift, and, uh, this voice, that would guide me. Along the way I stopped listening to that voice. I started living for my, my life from the outside in, seeing everyone else but me. My gift had become a curse. Then I found myself on top of a building, staring down. Sitting there in my 1200 dollar suit, Italian leather shoes, and I thought, I'd rather live. That voice came back to me. I decided to listen to it this time. JILL: Did you guys say you had some extra clothes? Because, my shirt's stolen, and I'm gonna' need some. JACK: Yeah, mine too, from the Walmart down the street. Okay, we got plenty. BRICK: You might wanna' get rid of that gun. [ SHIFTS IN CULTURE PLAYING] ♪ Till we meet again ♪ Till we meet again ♪ We'll walk on ♪ Never knowing Hey. You know, the truth is, I like a good fight.
