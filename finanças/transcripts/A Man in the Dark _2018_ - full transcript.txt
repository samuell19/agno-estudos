Anyone home? Goddammit! Mattie? Steve? What's all this? I was not expecting company. Well.. ...hate to drop in out of the blue, it's just.. ...you know, holidays. You guys, uh, you can't stay here. Excuse me? We drove all this way just to see you. Well, you've, uh, you've seen me and now you've gotta go. I don't wanna do this. Have you stopped long enough ever to think that what you want and what other people want are very different things? I don't care where you guys go, but you -- you can't stay here. Oh, for fuck's sake, I have just as much of a right to be here as you do. Matt? This was my idea, actually. It's Christmas. You really should get this checked out. Oh, it'll be fine. You smell good. I smell the same. It's still good. Place looks great. What did you expect? Mentally... I'm not sure where he is. Physically.. ...he can only sit and brood for so long. Says you. I'm sorry that we're not at home. He's gonna do what he's gonna do. Always has. They wouldn't wanna see him like this. Um, at some point, he's gonna have to learn to deal with these things on his own. Getting frustrated isn't gonna make it any easier. Something.. ...something feels wrong. Uh, we decided to stay. You've done a lot with the place. Do any work lately? Some new art. Looks nice. Yeah. You.. ...been doing some painting? Some finger painting? Karen's been doing some shadowing. - Yeah. - Yeah. Some secretary stuff at Miller and Wages. And I recently, uh, moved up to the new high school. We've been thinking, um, that the time might just be right to expand the family a bit. Oh. You know, um, if you're not too busy up here you are always welcome to -- to come down. We just redid the -- the guest room. It's, it's nice. Unless you're too busy ...here... you know. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. Miller and Wages. Hmm. It's just a job. Excuse me. It's a... it's eclectic. What? The decor. It's eclectic. Yeah, sure. Eclectic. You alright? Matt, could I talk to you in the kitchen for a minute please? Yeah. - Could you just try? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Sure. - Please? - Yeah. Okay. - Did anybody follow you here? - Huh? What? Steve, look.. Please? We shouldn't have just shown up. I'm sorry about that. I just really haven't been there and.. I don't want you to be alone. Am I boring you? Do you trust me? Yeah, sure. Really trust me? I gotta show you something. Okay. Are you okay? Wha -- what were you doing? What's wrong? What? Matt! Something's wrong with Steve. Um.. It's more complicated than that. I.. I think he might be dangerous. There's a man in the basement. Is someone, is someone there? Please. Please, can -- can you, can you help me? Ple -- please? Please, I just.. Please, I just wanna hear your voice. I just want to get to my family. The devil. How does this even happen? That -- that, that's not important. Not important? Okay. We need, we need to call someone. - Huh? - Call someone for help. No! We can't just leave him down there. You've dragged us into this. Look, our only... option.. ...is to remain very still. At least until we -- Oh, remain very still. Remain very still? Wha.. Okay, Steve... I love you, you know this. - I -- - This is, this is.. Impulsive decisions.. ...can go really wrong. Yeah. Matt, I need, I need you with me on this. You guys are not listening. What do you think they would say? If you called somebody right now and told them what I just told the two of you what do you think they would say? Would they believe you? Would they believe us? If we called someone and said that you somehow caught the devil and he's behind your cellar door. Would they believe us? - No! - I know this sounds crazy! I am not crazy! I've been trying to convince myself that I was. That t -- there's something just not right up here. There's something fucking loose or not in place! I, uh.. There is something evil locked behind that fucking door. It has conjured itself into the shape of a man. I have seen it. I have felt it. And I need both of you to believe me. No. - No. - I.. Honey, let's.. Can we just take a, take a deep breath for a minute? - Are you serious? - I don't... I don't know. I.. Say.. Just.. Honey... let's just say.. ...for the sake of argument.. ...that he's right. Right? It's the devil a -- and he, he's caught him. What's the plan? You just keep him locked down there forever? Yeah.. I.. I know you both felt something down there! Jesus, Steve. You.. Okay. I, we.. Matt, Matt. We cannot be a part of this. We cannot be a part of this. I am not fucking crazy. I'm not. What have you done? Just.. ...stay here. Matt! Look, I think that -- No. Stop. Listen to me. I have stood by your side and your family's side through everything. Everything. Any chance that we have for a normal life just went out the window with that man's choices. - He's my brother. - No, this is not grieving. - This is -- - This, this feels different. He believes this, it's.. - No. - All I'm saying is, what if? If you think even for one moment that -- No. Uh.. You're right, okay? This is a nightmare. But I won't have him spend his life in prison. He hasn't left us very many options, has he? We.. We'll just let him go. We have enough in savings, we just cut the guy a check. We don't even know who he is or how long he's been down there. We get Steve the help that he needs. 'Cause Steve's just gonna let him waltz out of there, right? Baby.. ...there are crosses on the doors. The windows are covered. This is less about keeping someone in as it is about keeping everyone else out. Faith makes people dangerous. He's not. There's a gun upstairs and it's loaded. I am tired. May I? What happened to us? I don't know. It's gonna be okay. I need you to believe me. Then help me. There's something in the air. There is a presence... now, it takes on many different forms but it has been around for as long as anybody can remember. Alright, you're a teacher. Now, take an educated guess as to how many people in this country, this year alone faced a violent death. I don't.. My wife cheated on me. Bang! I just needed a little money. Bang! Today, I just didn't like the look on his smug fucking face. Bang! It's a cycle. Now this man defines evil as a tangible force. Meddling in our affairs with two very different agendas. Now, there's man's evil, in which man harms man for the sake of greed, and vanity. And there's pure evil, in which man harms man for no other reason than to watch him suffer. It's all curated. And you believe that? Numbers and equations are only gonna get you so far, Matt. So I decide to go outside, walk down the street and just shoot somebody in the face? Well, you wouldn't. Even in today's highly enlightened society there remains a certain stigma against becoming a homicidal psychopath. It's, it's the instinct. It's the idea. Now without the seed, that thought would never even register. And keeping him down there? I trapped the seed. Let me show you something. You did all this? At first there's a lot of dead air. Bullshit to it all, but after a while you start peeling back layers there's a pattern. How long has all this been going on? Now it's still too early, to save the forest for the trees, but, uh.. You listen to the news you watch TV, things are changing right before our eyes. I mean, we are on the precipice of something. Here, listen. You know this story. Right? - Buckler girl? - Mm-hm. Missing for a month. And then out of the blue she's back. Now, I think.. ...given enough time others are gonna start showing up. You know... you could have called me before all of... this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even if the man's evil who's responsible for 99.9% of this world's bullshit that point one percent... millions. There's millions. Who even could just for a second live without that pain? Shh, shh. Who's been calling? I think something's coming for him. Yeah, sometimes I think I, uh I, uh, see things. I hear things. Who else have you told about this? See, I don't think I had to tell anyone. Good, bad, evil. It's like, it's like you're building a road, hm? But you don't know how far it goes but you know the destination. Now, something gets in your, in your path you're not just gonna give up. You're gonna find a way around until you're back on course. At first I thought, I -- I thought it was off. And people I had never even met before would just stop and stare at me. But it wasn't them. And then now.. ...at this critical moment.. ...after two years.. ...you two show up. - That's not why -- - Well, that you know of. Someone.. Something. I -- I'm not even sure if it is a thing, is coming. All I know is you back a dog into a corner you take away his means of escape and.. ...he's gonna bite. He doesn't wanna be down there anymore. Where's Karen? Is someone there? Please answer me, I just wanna hear your voice. I'm here. Please, c -- can you help me? Please. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, please don't go. I need to. Just hear me out. I don't know what he thinks I've done, alright but he's never gonna let me leave here. I can understand the uncertainty of it all. But right now you're the only thing standing between me and my loved ones. I just need to get to my family. You hesitate. Why? Oh, I see. This is because of what I did to them, isn't it? Open the door, Karen. What'd you hear? Get that fucking thing out of my face. I know you felt it. You were right. You don't need us. You never did. You can do whatever you want. I'm not here for you. I'm here for her. Fuck! Nobody leaves. I never liked that tree. The ornaments were our grandparents. Steve used to put every single one up. This, this is their thing. Almost. Almost. How does it feel? Hm? Being hopeless. Hm? You're alone. They're what made me... me. It's in your eyes, so I... I know you understand. The way you look at my brother.. ...the way he looks at you. It's there. It was just an accident. Wrong place wrong time. That doesn't change anything. That man is not evil for what he did but it is evil that let it happen. Evil is whatever hurts you the most. Open it. Prove it to yourself. And then you can see and I can see whatever it shows you. But I know.. ...something is coming. This is for your own good. Steve! Steve! Steve! Where are you? Please help. I can't stop the bleeding. Steve. Steve. I can't see anything. Why can't I see anything? There's something in here. I don't know what.. Stop! Stop it! Shut up! You're not real! You're not real! Please, help me. You're not real. You're not real. Steve. It's okay. It's okay. I wasn't here before for you.. ...but I am now. It's gonna be okay now. Just stay here, alright? Matt! Matt, wait. When I went down there, something's not right. I can't -- I can't explain it like Steve can but.. It's gonna be okay. I love you. Matt! Please, Matt. Matt! You have no idea what you're doing. Why, why can't you not just believe? I'm not doing this with you. You do what you do and it suits you so well 'cause you're required to take nothing on faith! The man behind that door he might be the devil to you he is for sure not the devil. - Matt, just -- - No, this.. Those papers, these people.. You are given the world and look what you've done with it! No, no, no, this was not about us! - This is about everything else! - No, it's about them! And none of this is going to bring them back! L -- l -- let's say you're right. Okay, we, we -- we free him, let him go and nothing changes. Okay. But what if you're wrong? Move. Get out of the way. No. Steve. Listen, there's a bigger picture. What have you done? What have you done? I didn't.. I didn't.. I didn't mean for this to happen. He just, he just.. He wouldn't stop. He's alwa -- always watching, always listening. You just -- just open the door and you can see them again. You can, you can see.. You can see her. Even if you tell them they won't believe you. They don't want to. But I know you do. Yep. Maybe it's for the best. It's a funny thing, isn't it, Karen? Finding yourself on the other side of the looking glass. God, you've got all of this useless knowledge and the only real certainty is that you'll never fully understand why. He's not quite gone yet, you know. You can save him. We can save him. It's up to you. Just open the door. Well, so be it. God, I almost got you though, didn't I? Oh, fuck. Well, she's always been a smart little thing. Copy that. - Let's roll. - Yeah. Police, open up! Hello! Anyone home? Holy shit. Ben! Holy shit. Hello? Is anybody there? Listen, hello, please. Please, please help me. Please, please. Hello? Please, please let me out. Is she still there? Please. Hello? Uh, hello? Is, is someone there? Please. Ple -- please. Please help me. Please. Ple -- please. Ple -- please. I just need to get to my family.
