Yeah, but it's still 10 grand. What about your girl? She's a piece of ass. She must be pulling in, what, 500 a night? No, she's not doing that no more, man. She's, um, you know. No shit, man. Yours? So you gonna be a daddy. Listen, 10 grand's fine. But it's gonna take me a little while. Well, when you get the scratch, you get the batch. See ya, daddy-o. Hey, sweetie. Hey, baby. I got your mail. So... How did it go? Fine. He said he wanted 10 grand, but he thinks we can pull, like, 30 or 40 with that. 40,000?! Really? Do you think we can do that? He thinks so. 40 grand... do you know how cool that would be? We could get out of this dump, out of this whole damn town, bring baby up in Phoenix with mama. I love you. I love you, too, em. What? First we gotta get the 10 grand. Well... you'll get it. I know you will. I'll take a shower. I got a postcard from mama. Yeah? Well, when you write her back, tell her I said hey. You can tell her when you see her. Even better. C.j., what a surprise. Did you do the job? C.J. Squeaky clean every time. Philodendron, amaryllis... I wonder who makes up such ridiculous names for such beautiful creatures? Conch shell. Flowers have sweet names. Violet, Daisy, Lily. Women are named for flowers. Have you ever heard of a woman named after a plant? Fern. Very good. Fern. But it's not a pretty name, is it? Sounds like "carpet." I asked if you did the job. He's dead. Your job was to kill the man who stole from me and bring back what he stole. So I ask you again... Did you do the job? No. There's absolutely nothing feminine about you, c.J. What you were supposed to bring back in that case is worth a half mil on the street. Find it and finish the job. 350 bucks? And all you got was a massage? Yeah, you believe that? You got ripped off by a hooker. That's awesome. I'm gonna take a piss. You got ripped off by a hooker. Asshole. It's my turn. Whoa. You can't be in here. We can call this off. It's gonna be ok. I don't know, honey. Look, you wanna go to Arizona or not? You know I wanna go. Yeah, and we need money to go. This is the only way I know to make money, baby. So we do this. But he said 10,000. I'll take care of it. It'll be ok, ok? Ok. He comes in here sometimes. I don't know his name or nothing. He ever pay with a credit card? You a cop or something? Am I gonna get him in trouble? Honestly, you'll be helping him get out of trouble. Man, I ought to bust a cap in your ass for bringing this knocked-up bitch up in here. You think this is goddamn K-Mart?! Chill out, dude. She's not gonna bust all over your shitty-ass, fuckin' carpet. She better not. Give us the shit for free, and I'll let you fuck me. This is sick. You're a sick, fuckin' bitch. Are we gonna do this shit or what? Aah! It's fuckin' over! Go get me some fuckin' towels right now, Emily! God! Get 'em! Get me some fuckin' towels! Hurry! Cheap vodka, straight up. You got it. I got that, drew. Nice gentleman just bought you a cheap vodka, straight up. Tell him thanks and bring me the one I ordered. Thanks. I'm Rick. That's great. Can I buy you another drink? No, thanks. Why not? Why not? Yeah. Because you asked "why not," because you drink dark beer, because you get a haircut and a manicure once a month at a salon, because you're not my type. Aah! What's wrong? I don't know! Aah! Baby, do something! I'm scared! All right. We're going to the clinic. Come on. Let's go. Watch my hand, baby. Ok, come on. Wait just a second. Just a second. Ok. All right. Gonna be ok. Come on. Come on outside. I'll show you my chopper. Maybe we can go for a little ride. Come on. Wait. Gotta get my coat. Forget your coat. Come on. Hold on. Slow down. Hey, sweetie. I'm sorry I'm late. You been waiting long? Fuckin' bitch. What? Sorry. I get it. Look, um, I had a bad day at work, and I'm here to get drunk and get laid and wake up in the morning alone. You think you can handle that? Yeah, I can handle that. Sure. Come on. Fix you a drink? No. May-maybe you wanna... Go to the bedroom? This is fine. Ok. I told you what this is. No, i... i know. I thought I could. But you can't. All right. Maybe if we get a drink first. Forget it. Wait. Look, Rick, nice isn't my type. And... We both know I'm not what you're looking for. Aah! Come here. What's wrong? I don't know. What do you feel, honey? Pain! Aah! Aah! Why is she so sick? A touch of a cold made worse by poor sleep. You try sleeping with one of these inside of you. Have you been smoking throughout your pregnancy, Ms. Robin? Just cigarettes. Your baby's quite small. We'll keep you overnight for monitoring, but I think you can expect a rough last few weeks in this pregnancy. Thank you. You ok? Baby. Yeah? When are we gonna leave town? As soon as I make the deal. Can't we just go, make the deal somewhere else? Honey, I've already got a buyer. Please, just rest and take care of that baby, and I'll take care of everything else. I need some things. I'll bring them. Ok. You take care of this. Do not let this out of your fucking sight. Ok. I know. Hello? Is this my little fern? Vernon. There's word on the street. Some kid trying to unload 20 kilos. Make sure he's got it before you do it. Hold it! Shit. I got it. So you just moving in? No. I don't live here. You working? Working? I'm sorry. You mean, am I a hooker? No, I'm sorry. We get a lot of those around here. You thought I was a hooker. I'm tired. I'm sorry. You are so dead. How you feeling? Good. Thanks. No problem. Can I get you anything? $40,000. I'm working on it. A little fresh air? That I can do. So... how much is it worth? All of it? Well, we got about 10 times what we thought we were gonna get, so... maybe 4-500 grand? Half a million? Really? Yeah, but that's selling it on the street, and we ain't gonna stick around while I sell it a little bit at a time. We've got to get rid of it all at once. So it's only gonna be like a hundred. Well, I'll take a hundred. Me, too. We're gonna build us a whole goddamn house with these little bricks. Help me up. I gotta pee. Gotcha. Careful, baby. Here we go. Do it! Shit! Can I help you? Yeah, I want to get an abortion. Ok. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? I don't have unprotected sex. Well, unless you're 2,000 years old and your name is Mary, you had unprotected sex about 5 weeks ago at least once. I always use a condom. Well, maybe it broke. Maybe it slipped off. And I'm on the pill. How could I get pregnant if I'm on the pill? All contraceptives are only 99% effective. That means that one out of 100 times... You can get dressed. Is the father involved? You know who the father is? How many partners have you had recently? I just want an abortion. Well, as part of our services, we require that our patients have some abortion counseling. Now, there are alternatives to abortion. Adoption, for one. Look, I want the abortion, ok? You want to waste your time for an hour, go ahead, but after that, I'm gonna have an abortion. If you want to help me, fine. If not, I'll find someplace else that will. All right. Well, how about Friday? Why not today? We have other patients. Friday's the first appointment. I'll find somewhere else. I think you'll find that most centers can't help you on a day's notice. I have counseled many, many women in your situation, miss march. I find that given a few days to absorb the idea of being pregnant, they often have a change of heart. I don't want a change of heart. That's all? Next Monday. Ok. All right. Thanks. Another. You got it. 2 vodkas, straight up. How are you? Fine. You look nice. You want to dance? Look... Rick. Rick... You had your shot. I know, I know, it's just... Why can't we just have a drink, get to know each other? 'Cause I don't get to know people. ♪ Come on, come on ♪ I don't want you ♪ you wait for me ♪ I need you to get away from me ♪ ♪ I don't want you ♪ you wait for me ♪ I need you to get away from me ♪ Not here. Come on. Ooh, that's nice. No, all right. Ok, not like that, all right? Just do it. Well, why don't we just fuck and do it my way? Fuckin' bitch! You ok? Come here. Big strong man. That way. I got you. Ok. Up we go. What made you so hard? Baby. Baby. Money. It's Troy. Hey, you don't need that, man. I'm just here to talk business. What you say, man? I hear doin' business with you don't go so well for some people. What'd you hear? I heard your game clock's running down. Look, I got 20 keys for 100. 100? You know, 100 is the... "I got clean stuff and time to do business right" price. Now, if I were to get this shit from you, you could get the, "I gotta get my punk ass outta town before I get capped" price. How much would that be? It don't matter. Ain't nobody gonna buy this shit from you. No matter how good the deal is, the price is too high. So why don't you get the fuck outta here before I go boba fett on your ass and collect it for myself? Did you sell it? What happened? Nothin'. Well, are we still leaving tonight? Honey, we can't leave yet. Look, I don't know anyplace else I can sell this stuff but here, so who knows how long it's gonna take? Just let me find a buyer and we'll go. Baby, let's just go, please? We got the stuff. We can sell it anywhere we want. I just don't feel safe here, Troy. What are you talking about? It's a feeling. Pregnant women get feelings, you know? Well, what if we go to a motel? On the outside of town, would that make you feel better? Why are you even still here with me? Please don't do this right now, em. I need to be gone. Sell that stuff on your own. You're makin' a fortune. Why are you even still here with me? Because I love you. And I love that baby. And I would never leave either of you for anything. That's the alcohol. Shit! What the fuck are you doing here? I'm bringing you breakfast. Could you put that down, please? I want you out. All right. Don't get the wrong idea, ok? I knew a kid in high school who passed out from alcohol poisoning and never woke up, so I brought you home, slept on the couch. So there's your breakfast, and you're obviously alive and very well-protected, so... I'm leaving. Um... you can stay for breakfast. No. I'm gonna leave. Don't make me force you. Someone was industrious this morning. Yeah. Um, for years, we had fresh flowers in church every morning. Church every morning? Guilty soul? Probably. I was a priest. You're kidding. Swear to god. See, I can say that kind of thing now that i'm... Not a priest anymore. So what was the other night? Just can't get past those celibacy vows? See, they tell you that your love of god and his for you is enough... But it wasn't. Maybe that makes me weak in the eyes of god, but I needed earthly love. I have to go to work. Where do you work? I'm a bean counter at a commercial real estate company. You like it? Yeah. Pays the bills when I show up. Right. Thanks for breakfast. It was great. Am... am I a masochist if I ask for your phone number? Right. I left mine by the phone. T-Take it easy with the alcohol. You never know who might wind up coming home with you. Would you put that out while I'm trying to do this? I'm scared. I smoke when I'm scared. You smoke 24 hours a day. Didn't the doctor tell you it was bad for the baby? Well, I guess I'm a shitty mom, then, aren't I? All right, gimme that stuff. Promise me we'll leave tomorrow. Stop fuckin' around, em. Just give it to me. Promise me we'll leave tomorrow. Baby, I told you, I have a bad feeling about this. Promise me we'll leave tomorrow. Deal or not? Ok, fine, just give it to me. That stuff hurt? Aah! Fuck! Hi. Is... this is c.J. Um, ok. Dinner... My treat. Bacachina, 7:00, on orchid. Fuck. Hi, this is Rick. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Look, no dinner. Just forget it. You workin'? Yeah, baby, I'm workin'. I know you get asked this all the time, but what's a pretty girl like you doin' in a place like this? It's not what you think. Never is, sweetie. Man. I ain't got no toys, but I'll go down on you for 20. I'm looking for Troy. I don't know no Troy. I'll give you 100 bucks. You don't even have to go down on me. Look, I just told you, I don't know no fuckin' Troy, all right? Take the 100 bucks. Please. Just take it. A'ight. Give me the 100. So how do you know pokey? Um, from the street. The street. Come on into my office. Have a seat. So what do you got? I'm sorry? What are you selling? Is this place real? What? Offices and secretaries and shit? I mean, what are you guys doing here? The only business you have to worry about here is what you bring. I got 20 keys of tar. Ready to go. Where'd you get it? What the fuck do you care? It affects the price and how I dispense of it. You want to make a deal, answer straight. You don't, shoot it all up yourself. O.d., die, I don't give a fuck. Brought it in from laredo. 45. I told pokey 100. Pokey ain't buyin'. 80. 55. Final. L-L-Look, hal, with all due respect, this is 20 fuckin' keys we're talkin' about here. I need at least 65. Did you hear me say "final"? 55. Fine. Ok. Tomorrow, call this number. Someone'll tell you where to bring it. Have a good day. Thanks for comin' in. You, you oughta get that hand looked at? Yuppie-ass fuckface. Bitch, chill. You make me spill this, I'm gonna fuckin' smack you. What did I say?! Money. Who's that? I'm lookin' for Troy. Come on in. It's open. Troy! I ain't seen him! Left or right? Ok, fuck! I got his number. Some shitty motel. Hello? Yeah. Do you guys have any vending machines? Across the street? That's it? Ok. Thanks. One? Ok. Would you like to sit at a booth? Um, I don't think we could fit at a booth. Do you guys have a bathroom? Sure. Right back there. Can I start you with some coffee? Jeez, please. Excuse me? Yeah? Is there any toilet paper in that other stall? Have you ever been pregnant? No. You have to pee, like, 100 times a day. They say that it's the best thing a woman can do, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it. ♪ Dance with me ♪ dance with me ♪ let's dance What are you doing?! Stop it! Stop it! Leave me alone! Take it out! C.J., take it out! C.j. ♪ Dance with me get out! Aah! Just leave me alone. Leave me alone. Whose is it? It's mine. I don't want it. Why? I mean, like this? What are you doing here? You invited me to dinner. I canceled. I ignored that part. Did you... Is it gone? I take it you don't want this baby, Ms. March. So I'm still... Yes. You did an excellent job of lacerating the internal wall of your vagina, but you didn't reach the uterus, so for a while, you'll find sex painful, urination excruciating, and there's a good chance of infection. You have an appointment for tomorrow. Why on earth would you do this to yourself today? Well, they never tell me why. I don't know why I keep asking. All right, Ms. March, if you don't want this baby that much, then let's get it over with. Are you gonna do the abortion now? I am. And I don't mind telling you it's gonna hurt like hell. Ms. March. Ready? Carol Jean. I'm sorry? My name. It's Carol Jean. Don't worry, Carol Jean. You'll be fine. Right in here. I'm here with c.J. March. She's been back there a while. I just wanted to make sure everything was all right. I'm sure it is. The procedure takes about a half an hour. Procedure? Now don't you worry, Carol Jean, everything'll be fine. All right, you relax. It doesn't take long. All right now, scoot down, lean back. Just relax. I don't want to do it. Get me off of this table. All right, c.J. No one's gonna force you to do anything. It's all right. It's ok. It's ready. Come on. You invited me to dinner, remember? The least you can do is eat. You lived here long? I never asked you. Where you from? Seattle. My mom and dad still live there. Karen. Frank. She's a schoolteacher. He's an airplane mechanic. Happy little life? Yeah. So where's the part about being so against having a child you're willing to mutilate yourself come in? C.j. I want you to leave my house now. No. You want me to leave, then you're gonna have to force me out at gunpoint. Heh! Otherwise, I'm staying, and we're getting to know each other. I'm not gonna talk about that. Ok. For now. You gotta be fucking kidding me, man. Are you gonna take this shit off my hands or what? Hey! Do you mind? No, no, it can't be tomorrow, man. It's gotta be tonight. Are you sure? All right. Fine. Tomorrow. Damn it! Would you turn that off? Emily! You said we were leaving today. Yeah, well, now it's gonna be tomorrow. Well, I don't want it to be tomorrow, Troy. I told you I have a bad feeling about this! The only bad feeling you've got is that 10-pound deadweight in your stomach. It's your baby. How do I know it's my baby? You know what? Who knows whose fucking baby it is?! My god. Sorry, honey. I didn't mean that. I wish we didn't even have this damn baby. Honey, don't. I mean it. I can't walk. I can't sleep. I hate this thing inside of me. Baby, don't. Please. Aah! Don't you dare hit me, you fucker! You'll hurt the baby. I'm sorry! If you ever hit me again, I will kill you.

Horror stories. Sins of flesh. Sins of faith. Crimes against people. Crimes against god. You know what the worst of them all was to me? Loneliness. The people who had the chance of love laid out before them who chose loneliness because they were afraid no one would forgive them for their crimes. You think you have the power to forgive me? No. But you do. Aah. What does it mean? It means I'm gonna have this baby. Right now? Unh! Soon! I'm gonna take you to the clinic, all right? Do the deal. Baby, forget the deal.

Don't be coy. I said, how long have you been pregnant? 5 weeks. Leave them there. What are you going to do? I'm gonna keep it. Is that right? Yeah. And I imagine you'll want time off from work, then? What do they call it? Maternity leave. I'm gonna stop, Vernon. Stop? You mean quit your job. Yeah. You can't just walk in and out of this life as you please. I've been in for a long time, Vernon. I've always done my job. Then why don't you do your fucking job?! Why can't you kill this guy and bring me my shit? It's the girl, isn't it? The pregnant girl. I think motherhood is making you soft, c.J. Unh! I want this job finished today. Is that clear? Unh! Get dressed and go to work. Housekeeping. Can you just come back... Sit! Who are you? Where is it? What?! Don't! Don't! Please don't kill me. Where is it? Aah! My husband took it! He took it to sell it! Where? Aah! At the train yard! Please don't kill my baby! Please! Please don't kill my baby! Please! Please! Your husband won't be coming back for you, so there's no reason for you to stay here. Understand? Yes. Leave it. Aah! Aah! Unh! God. Fuck. Em. Baby? Honey, we gotta go. My god. We gotta go, honey. My god! My god! Did you get the money? Honey, will you get me some towels? Come on, baby, I need you to focus. Go get me some towels. You gotta stop the bleeding and help me get to the car. No! Baby! Aah! I can't carry you like this! I can't do it! Baby, help me up. Please. Someone came here today. Someone came looking for you. A woman? What are you gonna do? You can't drive like this. I can get us out of town, and we'll find another place to live. Baby. I can't run with you like this. Honey, no! Aah! My god. Hello. Hi. Rick. I didn't think you'd be home. I was just gonna leave a message. Yeah. I, um... I was just grabbing some stuff, and i'm on my way out. How about dinner tonight? Yeah. Great. Bougainvillea room, 8:00? Bougainvillea room, 8:00. All right. Well, um, I'll... so I'll see you later. Yeah. Great. Bye. Good-bye. Unh!! Hello, flower. I've been expecting you all afternoon. I... "How to explain this away," she wonders. Were you going someplace? I was coming to see you. I did the guy. It couldn't be that you were leaving, quitting your job, ditching that nice young boy Rick? Leave him out of this. He has nothing to do with it. Look at you. Some microscopic Berry in your belly siphoned all your resolve, plucked your pluck. Is he any different from all the others? You haven't really gotten that close that you wouldn't just put a bullet in his heart if I paid you 20 grand. Fuck off. Let's see how deep these new maternal instincts fester. Do the girl, bring me my shit, or I will hire myself for one job at the bougainvillea room at 8:00. C.j.? If it's a boy, would you name him after me? Aaaah! It's me. I have to cancel. I'm... i can't do dinner. I'm sorry. Good-bye. Help me, please! Help me! God! Somebody, goddamn it, help me right now! Dr. Martinez, we need some help out here! Aah! Aah! Try to calm down! Aah! You have to calm down or I can't do anything. Get it out! I need you to calm down. No! Breathe. Calm down. That's a good girl. Good girl. All right, now let's have a look. I just can't. I'm sorry. I just want to see if she had the baby. You know, say hello. Sorry. Do you even know where she went, or are you saying no on principle? Look, you wouldn't want me to give out your personal information, now, would you? Your contractions have started, but you're not dilated yet. I'd say this baby's birthday is gonna be some time tonight, maybe tomorrow morning. I want it out now. I don't blame you. Just a few more hours. You can stay right here. Relax. Your baby will be along... no! Ms. Robin, please! I really have to go. Ms. Robin, you really should stay... I'm going! Call the police. Just give me the bag! Aah! Just give me the bag! I'll let you go. Fuck you! Aaah! My god. Did you see what happened? Help her. We need to help her now. What's your name? Don't move. Really, you shouldn't. You shouldn't move. Unh! Honey, are you ok? Whoo! My god! Are you having that baby?! Walt, I need a hand out here! Unh! Unh! Aah! Unh! Ambulance is on its way. Ambulance ain't gonna make it! Tina, get some towels. Walt, honey, you always like to play doctor. Aah! Where's that woman who... that... Ma'am, you gotta wait for an ambulance. That's it. Damn! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It's coming out. That's it! Just breathe! Aah! Goddamn it! Here's his head. Aaaah! It's a boy. Is he ok? Why isn't he crying? He's ok. He's small, though, real small. Can somebody just cut this thing? The paramedics will be here soon. You want to hold him? I'm gonna go wash up. We'll be right out that door. I'm so sorry. You're so small. I'm so sorry! Excuse me. My god. Are you ok? Yeah. No, I just... I'm worried about my friend. She came in. She was pregnant, and she... Yeah. She's fine. She's right back here. Where'd she go? Aaaah! Stop! Aah! No! Please don't kill me! Please don't kill me! I don't want to die! You know what's funny? The only reason I didn't kill you before was because you were pregnant. Please. Here's the bag. Just, please, you don't have to kill me. Why don't you just leave the bag and go? Aah! Hello, flower. It's over, Vernon. No, I don't think so. C.j.! C.j., c.J., c.J. Hey, c.J., c.J., I'm here. C.j., I'm here. It's ok. What... are you doing here? I canceled dinner. I know. I ignored that part. It's gonna be ok. All right? I just have to get the ambu... C.j. C.j. Hey, c.J. C.j., c.J.
