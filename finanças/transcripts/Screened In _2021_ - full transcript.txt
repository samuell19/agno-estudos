Excuse me, sir. Have you seen my phone? I left it on that wall over there. It's got a gray phone case. No, I'm sorry, I haven't seen it. Good luck in finding it. Thank you. Pardon me. Have you seen my phone? It's got a grey phone case. No, dear. I am sorry, I haven't. What's wrong? I think someone stole my phone. What did it look like? It's got a gray... Want some lemonade? Hi, two please. Just a donation. Oh okay, great! Wanna put that in the jar? Okay. There you go. What do you say? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. - You too. - Oh! - Oh I'm so sorry! So sorry! It'll be all right. Hi, how much for one lemonade? Donations. All right, awesome. There you go. Have a nice day. Thank you, bye. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much! That was so thoughtful. Hey, are you Peyton Hawthorne? Yeah, yeah I am. Yeah, your mom and I volunteer together at the animal shelter. Hey, sweetie. How was your day? It was fine. - Sophie! - Sophie! - Should we head inside? - Yeah. Yeah, awesome! Wait guys! Happy birthday! Thank you. Late as always, I see. - Hey Landon. - Hey there. Hey Landon, Tyler just texted me. He said you were supposed to be at his house like an hour ago. Uh okay. Tell Tyler I'll be there in a few. - Bye. - See you. So where should we put our stuff? Uh, over there I guess. Cool, let's go! You guys ready for some cake? - Sure! - Yeah! So what's your wish going to be? Can't tell you that. My Instagram photo is gonna be amazing. You know, I lost like 20 followers when Instagram did its full like bot sweep. - That's terrible. - Isn't that ridiculous? I mean I didn't have very many followers to begin with so then losing more. Don't you guys like my cake? - Sure. - Yeah, yeah. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Peyton ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ So perfect! Are you done yet? Who's there? It's Skylar! It's Skylar? Yeah. Hi. Happy birthday! - Good to see you. - Hi. So what are we gonna do? Well, I was thinking we could maybe do some board games, like Sorry, or Candyland or Monopoly. Monopoly! Remember your brother when we were playing? He like flipped over the table! Mom! Is that an iPhone? Yeah, isn't it cool? I'm getting one for Christmas. That's so not fair! I have to wait til I'm 13. Let me see that. I saw the most hilarious YouTube video the other day. Let's see if I can find it. What about Monopoly? That must be Sophie! Yeah! This is a lame excuse for a party. What are you talking about? I mean, look at you. You're all off in cyberspace somewhere. You're on Instagram and Sophie's on Snapchat. Courtney's working on her blog. I might as well have celebrated my birthday by myself. I know how you feel, Peyton. You do? How so? I've been thinking about this a lot lately. Thanks to social media I'm more connected than I've ever been. And yet I've never felt so lonely. I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. Yeah, it's pretty depressing all right. So what do you suggest we do about it? Pardon my eavesdropping girls, but it sounds like you could all use digital detox. What is she talking about? She's suggesting we give up our screens for awhile. But that would kill me. Skylar, please. Don't be so dramatic. I'm not being dramatic. I, I think I have a problem. Go ahead, fess up. We're all ears. Okay, I will then. Last night I stayed up until four in the morning watching YouTube videos. And the night before that I didn't sleep at all. I think I'm like addicted. There I said it, I'm addicted to my phone. Well then I must be too. I mean, I check mine like every five minutes. I even sleep with it under my pillow at night. Peyton, you know that's a fire hazard. I know but I just can't help myself. Want some orange juice? Orange juice, Courtney. What does he even mean by this? Care to elaborate? Clearly Andrew misunderstood my last text. And if I'm not mistaken, I think he just broke up with me. Was there ever a worse form of communication? So about the digital detox. If we're going to do this, we should make a pact. No screens for 24 hours. What do you say? But what about my Instagram followers? And my Facebook friends? Come on Sophie. They aren't your real friends. I resent that. Besides you're not gonna lose all of your followers in just one day. Are we talking every screen? Even my laptop? Anything with internet connection. We can do this guys. Right, we can help each other. Okay, so we power off. Then what, we just sit around twiddling our thumbs? Not at all. We can... - Play board games! - Yes! You can't be serious. I'm up for a game of Monopoly. Me too, I haven't played it in ages. Care to join us? I've got some business to attend to. I'll be the cat. Ooh, I want to be the shoe. I'll get the top hat. Yeah, I can be the banker. I mean, I'm not gonna judge. Hey babe, you ready to go? Just one more game. But I only have an hour. It'll only be a minute. Game over. What was that for? Come on Tyler, it's just a game. - Hey. - Hi. I got that for my birthday, but it wasn't my size. Oh okay. Would you like store credit or cash back? Actually, could you put it on my card? Sure, no problem. All right, there you go. - Thanks. - Yeah, of course. Can I help you? Yes, thank you. I have this notebook too. It's perfect for journaling. Great, that's what I'm getting it for. It actually helped me break my screen addiction. You know, I've been thinking about cutting back myself recently. Are you glad you did? It gave me back my life. Monopoly, really? I mean, who wants to play board games on their 16th birthday? How lame is that? Uh huh. She could have flown us to the Azores with all the money she has. Oh, and I totally forgot to tell you, last night as I was sleeping my dog got abducted by aliens. Yeah. Oh, I have to go. Sorry we're late. Got stuck behind a student driver. Hey, you're looking at one. Sorry. So about the pact. I've been mulling something over. What if we went a week instead of just a day? I mean, how much good can 24 hours really do? You're crazy. I agree with Peyton. I did some research last night, and it kind of shook me up. Listen to this. Teen suicide rates have nearly tripled since the introduction of the smartphone, the study finds. MRis revealed that brains on smartphones are nearly identical to brains on drugs. And researchers say that the average person will spent over 34 years of their life staring at a screen. Am I the only one that finds these things disturbing? It sounds like the risks of screen use might outweigh the benefits. But there are so many benefits. I mean, I just Face Timed my aunt and she lives in Thailand. And then there are selfies and GPS. I mean, where would I be without GPS? Why don't we just reduce our screen time? It's not that simple, Sophie. I think we have to break our addiction first. I agree with Peyton. One week. Well, where do I sign? Count me out. I guess it's just the two of us now. Excuse me, ma'am. You're spilling something all over the floor. Oh my gosh! Do forgive me. I was so busy texting I didn't even notice. It's actually, it's actually a bottle of margarita mix for my son that I just picked up. I must've hit it on the door on my way in. I'm so sorry. I've made such a mess! - It's no problem. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Absolutely no problem. Looks like we might have a trio. Hey! Perfect. No screens for one week. But wait, I thought we'd agreed to 24 hours? You should probably read the contract next time. - Hey. - Hi. How's that journaling going? I haven't started yet. I'm not really sure where to begin. Perhaps I could be of help. Oh hey hon. Why aren't you working on your blog? We're fasting from all screens, mom. Not just our phones. You can go to library. I can't use their computers either. They're still screens. Books, Courtney. Talking about books. Right. You know, I think I will try the library. Oh great. Skylar, this is Amy. Why haven't you been answering my texts? Pick up your phone already. Skylar? Whatever. Marilyn, I can't believe teenagers today. They're literally glued to their phones. It's really dreadful, isn't it? You know the other day I was on my way to Pilates class and this girl came running up to me and she asked me if I'd seen her phone. Poor thing. She was utterly frantic. That's how they get when they lose their phone. This is a cute shop. You ate all the cookies! That was a lot of work! Mom, Skylar ate all my cookies! Make her nose bigger. Hurry up, we don't have all day. Can't you see I'm trying? Okay, now give her skin a green hue, but make it look realistic. Oh, and can you mess up her hair a little bit? I'll do my best. Successful trip to the library? These are totally antiquated. What are you talking about? This is from this year. What? Like six months ago. Just as I thought. I'm going to lose all of my followers. I'm so excited it's almost Spring Break. Hey! Hey! How was the exam? So, about the digital detox. You first. Honestly, it's been great. I've actually become reacquainted with the library. I kind of forgot it existed. And you, Peyton? I think I've done pretty well. Okay, maybe I went shopping a little too much, but at least I stayed off my phone. And you, Skylar? Piece of cake, or cookies. So I did do a little bit of binge eating, but it was totally my sister's fault. I haven't looked at a single screen. Why are you looking at me that way? What if we just exchange one addiction for another? Does that still count? I'll have to think about that. You know what I just realized? We're actually having a real uninterrupted conversation. I could really get used to this. Me too. Oh, I forgot I have to babysit today. Peyton, your phone! We still have three days left. It's just for emergencies. See you! That's not an emergency. Go kill yourself? One. You must be the new babysitter. I found this chicken thief stealing a chicken out of my coop. Is everything okay? He swallowed my antidepressants. 911, yes I'm at... There's a boy here. He took some pills, I think. Maybe three or four? Yes, we're at we're at 456 North Mason. Yes, please hurry. I don't know what's going on. I don't know if he's okay. Honey, why don't you just wait here, okay? How's the Reese boy doing? Is he still in a coma? Unfortunately yes. Yeah, what's his prognosis? Dr. Hughes says it's too early to tell. It doesn't look good. Peyton! Peyton! Any news on Dylan? It's been almost a week. Well, as far as I know he hasn't gotten any worse. I'm sorry you're going through this, Peyton. Sure wish you would have kept that pact. You're the lamest brother in the world! She didn't mean that, son. But that was really inappropriate. You're right. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. You know Peyton, we can't change the past, but we can learn from our mistakes and do better in the future. I don't know that I can. Of course you can, honey. Not having my phone is like missing an appendage. Now I've just replaced it with my tablet. Maybe you should get off the grid for awhile. As if I'm the only one that has a problem! Hey, look, I have problems all right. But screen addiction isn't one of them. Oh really? Monday, seven hours and 33 minutes. Entertainment, social media and, Landon! Well at least I didn't kill a kid. How dare you! What are these? There's something I've been meaning to tell you. What's that? Sorry, I should've told you a long time ago. You have a half sister. What? I was a junior in high school. My boyfriend got me pregnant. It wasn't consensual. But that's horrible. I had to give the baby up for adoption. Her name is... Chloe. I know her. How do you... That's the hospital. Hello? This is she. What? Oh, that's wonderful news. Can we come visit him? Right now? Oh, thank you so much. Dylan's awake! What are you doing here? Oh, I volunteer at the children's ward. Are you here to see a patient? Yeah. Dylan Reese. Chloe, what happened? I'm so sorry, Peyton. I can't tell you. I signed a confidentiality agreement. What I meant to say was what happened to you? I got in a car accident a few years ago. How did it happen? I slammed into a tree while texting. I'm so sorry. It's okay, I knew I had a problem. I was glued to my phone back then, but I never thought it would lead to this. That never would have happened if I didn't break my pact. What pact? I was on day four of a digital detox when I fell off the wagon, so to speak. That's when Dylan got into my Prozac. Antidepressants? The cyber bullying. It really gets me down. Chloe. It's okay, mom. I already know. Hey Trish, are you sitting? You are not going to believe what I just read. Hold on a second. Daniel. I'm sorry, Trish, but Kristen just married a famous Hollywood producer. No, Kristen Bowers. Chloe's birth mom. No, they never met. It's a closed adoption. Funny, I was thinking the same thing. Chandler Hawthorne. Yeah, talk about a change in circumstances. I think I can help you, Peyton. Really? My uncle, he owns this cabin on an island off the grid. I went there to break my screen addiction. If you'd like I could take you there with me. You'd, you'd do that for me? Of course. Besides I've been itching to get back to the island since my accident, but I don't feel comfortable going alone. I would really love your company. By any chance could I bring a couple friends along? They've been struggling with screen addiction, too. Absolutely. Hoping we can catch some fish. Bet I can get double what you can get. I don't know about that. Who do you think I am? Some kind of moron? Come on, Morgan. She's like a sister to me. Oh really? I've seen the way you look at her, and I read your texts. Oh Peyton, happy birthday. You're such a beautiful young woman. And now you're going on a trip with her behind my back? Look, Landon and I are just going on a fishing trip to get off the grid. We're just dropping them off on the way. Oh, so now you've joined in on the digital detox too? Okay, it was your idea for me to cut back on my gaming. I swear, Tyler, if you leave on that boat, we are finished. ♪ Waves washing over ♪ ♪ The sand on our feet ♪ ♪ Time is an ocean ♪ ♪ And I'm lost at sea ♪ ♪ Tomorrow will find us ♪ ♪ But I still believe ♪ ♪ Searching for you is looking for me ♪ ♪ We are timeless ♪ ♪ We are timeless ♪ He sure did. That's so cool. Oh, I just love this garden. Look at those roses, oh my goodness. All right, make yourself at home. Check out this incredible view. And this awesome loft. Bunk beds! This is just like summer camp! Dibs on the top bunk! Speaking of beds, would any of you mind if I put my feet up for a minute or two? Of course not. By all means. We can make some snacks. Perfect. Anyone for pistachios? Peyton? Here it goes. Five straight days without any screens. And no way to cheat this time. What a relief. Do you really think things will be any different when we get back? Yeah, I think they will. If we can commit to making some changes. What are you suggesting? I think we need to set some boundaries. Maybe cut our social media time in half. I think that's doable. And we should probably keep all screens out of our bedrooms. And turn them off at dinner. Peyton, you're pretty quiet over there. It's just, I've been considering giving up smartphones altogether. Hey girls, you guys wanna go on a hike? Sure, I'm always up for an adventure. Okay, yeah maybe grab us some snacks. Yeah. I'll tell you where it's at. So head back down to the dock, and then about a quarter mile along the beach on the right hand side you're gonna see the trail head. Great. Yeah, shouldn't take you guys more than an hour. Okay. Yeah, have fun. We'll see you later. Yeah, see you. Bailey, you gotta stay here, okay? No Bailey, come on. I know. Have fun! Don't fall. You either, please. I'm doing my best. There's no hospital on this island. - Here's the trail. - Awesome. Come on, Courtney. Slowpoke! This is so gorgeous. Yeah. I have yet to see a single mosquito, Skylar. So what are you swatting at? I could swear I feel my phone vibrating in my pocket. They're called phantom vibrations, Skylar. They'll go away eventually. Did you see that slug back there? I know, that was so weird. It was like, hanging from the tree. Are we still on the trail? It's just a little overgrown. A little? I think we should turn back. Come on, Peyton. This island can't be that big. I'm famished. Okay guys, I think we're officially lost. Where's Google maps when you need it? Hey, I think I see the remnants of a trail. Let's try this way. What time is it? I think my blood sugar is dropping. Maybe around eight. I'm sorry, Peyton. I would have brought more snacks if I'd known we'd be out for so long. It's okay, I'll be fine. Maybe we should pick up the pace. Peyton! Bailey. Wait, one second. I learned in survival camp that you can actually eat sting nettles. - Stop! - Don't touch that! They're called stinging nettles for a reason. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. Wait, what's this? Look, another one. Thank God. What happened to you guys? We got a little lost. But then we found these. [Skylar That was so funny when you fell off the paddleboard yesterday. I wouldn't exactly call it funny. I thought it was funny. Oh, are these the marshmallow sticks? Nice job on the fire, Peyton. Thanks. I'm so sorry about the trail girls. My uncle must've stopped maintaining it after my accident. Accident, I thought you were just born that way. What happened? Skylar! What! I slammed into a tree with my car a couple of years ago and shattered my pelvis. That's awful. Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst of it. I got a brain bleed when my head hit the dashboard. The doctors didn't expect me to survive. Skylar, your marshmallow! Go on. So much of it is a blur. I'm told that I was on the brink of death for weeks, but my lowest point came when my doctor told me that I would never walk again. I swear when I heard that I wanted to curl up and die. I can't even imagine. That's when I began contemplating my mortality. Something that I'd never done while plastered to my screen, Instead of succumbing to despair, I found myself overwhelmed with this intense desire to live and this rising conviction that my life had purpose. And I vowed that if I did live, I would find out what that purpose was. And I did. Life is precious girls, and I don't want to waste another minute of it. Which is why you tackled your addiction?
