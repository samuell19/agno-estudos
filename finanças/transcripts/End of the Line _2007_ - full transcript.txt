You seem very sure of yourself OK, buddy if you know something, now's the time to spill it Well, you see, I like to keep an open mind I mean, what if the Reverend is actually right?

They're too serious All they think about is the mission They gotta save the people right away. Where's the fun in that?

Alright folks, lets get ready This is our last stop before we hit the exit So if anybody has to go to the bathroom, now's the time So I gotta take a major dump Actually, I gotta go too Uh, so do I You're pathetic! Karen, I uh… We're really lucky to have you here Thanks Earlier today, a patient of mine threw herself in front of a train Shit Do you think she might have known what was gonna happen tonight? I don't know, but… this won't sound rational… but when I was alone on the train, I saw her And earlier in the tunnel, I'm sure I saw… things I know it sounds crazy, but I just… Karen, come on, OK? It's dark out. We can hardly see anything And we're really scared So whatever it was, I'm sure it was something else Let me put it this way Karen — I would love to see a ghost, even a scary one Because any proof of an afterlife would only be great But no matter what all the Bible thumpers say I will never believe in the apocalypse Heaven, Hell, Messages from God… You know, whatever I agree with you Or at least my head But when I'm alone in the dark, I'm still scared of… ghosts and demons… and bogeymen The next time you see a ghost, or a demon, or the bogeyman… you just look him straight in the eye and marvel at his very existence Because you are seeing proof of an afterlife Or proof that you are hallucinating and should see a doctor Whichever one works for you Thanks for being there, Mike Likewise Davis come in. Davis, you OK? Yeah! Man its good to hear your voice. Where you at? We're uh… We're safe. And when we find help, we'll send it your way Hey, make it quick, will yah? And be careful! You fuck!

You're stuck with me We can't leave them alone with him! What do you want to do? Kill him? No. I guess not He's tied up solid, he's not going anywhere Come on Ready No! Oh god! Wait! Don't worry, everything will be alright Don't hurt me, I'm a Hope member Yeah! We are both Voice members. But with all the fighting and confusion… It is a sin to lie, my child! But you will still be saved… Frankie, tell them I'm with you Frankie, please! Sorry You sonofabitch! Oh god! No! No! No! Please! Don't! Oh, for God's sake! My child, this is for God No! No!
