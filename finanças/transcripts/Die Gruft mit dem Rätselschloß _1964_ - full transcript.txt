Hi, old fellow. You can wake up now. Shush, let him sleep. That old fellow is fast asleep. He certainly is luckier than we are. He was just bored to death of the movie! This one is worse than the telly. Excuse me, sir, but the movie is all over. Excuse me sir, but the movie has ended. Hello. This is Edgar Wallace speaking. This is going too far! Two times is enough! If I were you I'd take better care of my head. - Mister... Flynn. Now down in Australia this luggage would be put under lock and key! Not in england. In a few minutes we'll be in London. I'll better get back to my compartment. So long. So long. Thank you for your company, miss Kent. And do have a good time in London! Have fun now. She's not here to have fun, sir! Miss Kent, should you ever need help... I will help her! I'm sure you will, but if you... Should ever have a need for me, don't hesitate to ring me up anytime. What kind of trouble can you have when you inherit money? I think money brings us trouble! 15 years in jail next time! Thank you. No one's here naturally. Oh ferry, don't be so anxious, someone will come. - Sorry, sir. I've been waiting 20 years. Don't worry, now what did I do with it? No one can miss us how. Eh, miss Kent? - Yes. My name is simson. Thank you, mr simson. I'm ferry westlake, a law student and an advisor to miss Kent. Oh, not alone, miss Kent? No, as you see! I'm supposed to take you to your hotel. Thank you! Ah, just the gentleman I'm looking for... Shall we go? Oh, my law book. I'd fire the fool who lead that attack. What department was that, angel? Sir, it's a film. - Film, oh! Yes, yes, even worse. You happen to hear a shot, sir? What did you say? I took a shot sir. When? During a machine gun volley. We already know this man was shot! The girl or anybody... Didn't hear the shots that we fired. I didn't hear the shot, sir, really. Just what are you trying to prove then? The dead man is a French croupier: Jean de prigeot. Here, he's this one. The other croupiers in this picture form a group, which always happen... To appear when there is anything strange going on. And they always seem... To be involved, but we can never prove it! My guess would be... I am not interested in your speculation, just the facts. Thank you, young woman. Thanks, miss! I hope you will be comfortable here! 1 do, too. Would you show us to miss Kent's room? This way, sir! Aha! Yes... It's all so nice... But... yes, miss Kent... And well, what I mean is... I will need a room to sleep in. But ferry, they'll give you a room, too! Naturally, we had no idea that you had someone accompanying you. A young woman is always in need of a bodyguard and legal adviser, and both... Is this case. It can be a vicious world. You are right Mr... Westlake. - Mr westlake. The window has gates on it. I fancied it would be much nicer. Our reservations weren't for this hotel. It's very nice here, and the bars on the window are merely for our protection. Early provincial, really very charming. Miss Kent? - Yes. I'm sorry to disturb you. My name is Connor. This is mr massay. Welcome to London. Thank you, but... My name is westlake. On behave on barrister thomson of Sydney... I am to see for miss Kent. I'm sure they will understand... sorry! Mr Connor, this isn't my hotel. Why then are we here? Because we're good friends. I don't understand. You'll understand soon enough. Miss Kent, you didn't need protection! According to § 14, section 6... Of the civil law in Australia, miss Kent, possessing mandatory power for her... Personal protection, has declared... Mr westlake! We are honoured... To have you as a guest! I didn't quite understand. Thank you! We'll talk more after you've had relaxed. Ring the bell if you want anything. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. We'll ring the bell then! Gentlemen! I couldn't follow them. There were no cabs! - That's bad, spedding! I took the number of their cab. That's good, spedding. But there is no cab with this number. That's bad, spedding! Mr real... She's got my name and address. I'm sure she'll call or come. If she can... You mean your former associates... Associates, they're criminals. They must have found out... Not from me. The money, the girl's money. I doubt it! Yes, how would they know? = it wouldn't be hard for Connor... To get this information. Spedding, I have to make up for the wrongs I've committed! My invention brought me wealth and sadness, but I will never forget the way she looked when all that she owned was sold in public action... Because I demanded payment of her fathers gambling debts. I'm ashamed! I must give her back what I took from her father years ago! Connor is a clever fellow, mr real! He'll try something... Well, mr Connor will be well received if he dares to come here. Ms Kent, I don't know how much I can say. Don't worry. Mr westlake... Is trustworthy. You can talk. Thank you. In a manner of speaking... I'm miss Kent's personal representative... Yes, I see. So it was the barrister spedding who asked you to London? Then you are not with mr spedding? We're not exactly his clients. Here is a duplicate of your invitation. Misappropriation of a correspondence... Is punishable by long imprisonment according to § 411. What's going on? Why do you lock us? I'd like to remind you that kidnapping is punishable by imprisonment! Ah, miss Kent, you're not really... A prisoner. As our partner you can enter and leave as you wish! Confidence for confidence. I am positive we will become good... Partners if I tell you who invited you. So you're finally going to tell me? Your father was a governor in Brisbane. He was? = your father killed himself. His debts were heavy. The man who drove him to it, who caused him to commit suicide, this man asked you to come here! Is that a fact? Why me? He wants still more than the money... And the life of your father. = still more? How is that? The youthful girl, barely 20 years of age... The old man has a vivid imagination. What is it you'd like me to do? Finally! You ask for what is rightfully yours. We have some ways to make sure... He gives it up. You could even... Try to learn how to open the vault! The vault? We can talk about it later! This man has cheated us, too, so it's very important... May I inform you of the extremely doubtful legal side to this matter... Because as mentioned in paragraph 447... Now think of this man, he was the one who drove your father to suicide. You must hate him, do you? I need to think it over! I must interrupt again! According to paragraph 323 you... Yes? The gentlemen are impatient! Think it over. I do think you'll agree! What's the meaning of this that you're impatient? Prigeot has been removed! Right in the middle of a movie! I wouldn't think that's such a bad piece of news for you? - Why? That just means there's one less of us to push around! It was just an opinion. Keep your opinion! And the girl? Did she agree to do it? She'll agree to whatever we ask of her. We'd better hurry. We haven't much time! An old friend of ours is back. Jimmy Flynn is in London! Eh? - Yes. I figured he'd come! We'll watch his every move... We'll? You'll! Well, if the girl meets real as was planned, does real know... What she looks like? I mean 8 years is a long time. And Kathleen... is just a name! You mean? - That's what I mean! Who? Lissy, the girl from the cinema. So you are Kathleen Kent. My invitation must have come as surprise. Here, sit down. Did you find my letter at the hotel? Yes, that is why I came here directly. Relax, miss Kent, there is nothing to worry about. Your future is in my hands, good hands. Now then sit down. Thank you. That is not Kathleen Kent! Are you sure, spedding? Yes, sir! = you're not Kathleen. Who sent you here? Come on, your going to tell us who sent you here. Where is miss Kent? Who is paying you? I don't know, I really don't know! That's enough, spedding! It's better if you tell me! You see, one life doesn't mean... Anything at all. Where is miss Kent? I don't know. I swear I don't know! Who sent you here? Real god, she's been shot! But who did it? Who do you think would kill a person to shut them up? You mean... Figure it out... poor girl! You'd better get rid of the body. Go on. Don't be afraid! I will hammer the law into the heads of those sordid idiots... So that they'll never forget it again! Please ask for water. Do what I tell you, please. Would you please bring me some water? Of course! § 411 of the penal code states... Here is your water! - Thank you. Now, in name of the law, and order... and justice! I think he's had enough for now. Oh my, what are these? Wait here one minute and be quiet! Watch out, Johnny, the stupid ones escaped! You'll be sorry calling me stupid! Hello? Don't you wish to be with us? Of course, I was just going for a walk! You old fool! Where's the girl? Locked up! Remember assault and battery is punishable by hard labour now! Clumsy fellow! According to § 149b, section 3, line 2... Violence is considered a crime and is to be punished accordingly. Besides in self-defence I am known as karate expert. Where is mr westlake? It is I who should be asking the questions, but mr westlake is safe. Please sit down! Miss Kent, why don't you cooperate with us? You don't like my associates? I don't either! Don't worry, the police will take them away. There will only be two of us left. Listen to me! Don't you touch me! Hands up! Stay where you are! What was that? Who shot? Speak when you're asked to! Lizzy isn't back yet. Perhaps she ran into something... That prevented her coming back. By the way, in the future... I'd rather step in sooner. You can never tell what might happen! Clever! Come in, come in! Well, Jimmy, it's good to see you again. My dear mr real. It's nice to see you alive! It's difficult to stay that way. I see you managed to come up here... To see me. You would have been pleased more... If I hadn't made it up here! Eh, mr real? Oh yes, please, though you know my inventions are not for my protection. I know what they are for... Money, right? I guess you want it? Not all of it, just my share! Connor and massay will come, too. Massay won't get a cent! He was cheating me! Perhaps you taught him how... Someone's coming. You tripped the devices, and I haven't reset them yet. Hands up! Come on, you're too old for that. Pity you didn't come before. I would have been glad if you were trapped downstairs! You look silly! Relax and sit down. Only Connor's not here. We might play bridge... And remember old times! Prigeot can't make it. He was murdered I think. I'm not interested in your babbling. Where's that girl? If you sent her to me, massay, I have a question for you! Where is Kathleen Kent? Ask Connor! Didn't you come to pick up miss Kent? No! I want the cash! - You do? Why now? You've been waiting such a long time. I can't wait any longer. I want my share before the others get it. If you don't hand it over I'll get it myself! - Good, massay, I agree if you think you're smart enough... To open that vault, then by all means go get it! You get it! Massay, you'll be the last one... To get anything because you are a lowly cheat and a common criminal. Criminal? You were the one that exploited people and ruined them! 1? Did I ever sit at a gaming table? You were the boss! For whom did Jimmy, prigeot, Connor and I get the money? For you! For all of us! I won't let you cheat me! I'll show you. You put your gun down there! Are you part of it? Real! I'll take you to the doctor! No doctor, Jimmy. Take me to the mill. Real's hurt. Get a bed ready for him! What happened? Don't ask now! They knocked me down. Then they drove me around the city! I don't mind being shown the city. When I took to self-defence they threw me out of the car! They wanted me in the thames! A representative of justice doesn't fall into a river! He goes on and on without saying anything! Under the eyes of the best police... In the world! Pardon, I regret getting personal, but in Australia... These things wouldn't happen like this! Let's try to figure out where you... And miss Kent were detained. In which direction were you moving? East or west? I don't usually carry a compass! Do you think miss Kent is still there? = I'm afraid so! And miss Kent received a cablegram from spedding, mentioning a sum of money. Is that right? - Yes. Does that mean that miss Kent retrieves all the money her father lost gambling? Yes, that man said so! From whom? That wasn't mentioned, no names! Real's name, or the address? Sir, I repeat: There was not a single name uttered! Do you know this man? He was one of the men from the hotel. He was, you mean. "Was"? - He's dead. You see, last night he fell into a canal... And broke his neck. It's a pity! He has such a thick neck! The police found massay today. They said he was killed 3 ways. He was electrocuted, poisoned and also his neck... Was broken! - Good, spedding. Inspector angel was trying to get detailed information... About you! - That's bad! I told him you had gone away. That's good, spedding. Where are you really, mr real? That's not your affair! No, of course not. Did you find miss Kent? No, not yet! - Very poor! It would be better if you did more and ask less! You'll hear from me! My friend, you shouldn't ask questions. You should act. I would like to confer... With the person in charge here. That's me. Surely you jest. Before you laugh, I have a question. Please ask it! If you can't seem to find a thing... You like in merry old england, why don't you stay in your own blasted country? I protest, sir John! Only I can protest around here! I'll keep it in mind, sir! You do that! Do you think it would do any good to give him a book on manners? Perhaps you should have a look at it too! = mr Flynn, sir. Show him in. Thanks very much for your information. Now go back to the Victoria. You'll be hearing from me! Thank you. Your are most reasonable. Hello, mr westlake! You've just arrived here and you already know the police? Well, to be honest with you: I have already made too many acquaintances here. Good day. Where did you pick that one up? I might ask you the same question! I knew you were in London... Before you rang me up. Where have you been? The police knows each of my steps. I even know where you went tonight! To the house of old real. You shouldn't smoke such extravagant cigarettes. I'm imprudent. - Stay that way! What can I do for you? I just wanted to see you. No question? - A few. That's more like it! I was at real's, but I had nothing to do with massay's death! I want to talk to you about quite another thing. About a young lady... That real invited to London, and never arrived. She's being kept as a prisoner... In town. Her name is Kathleen Kent. Being kept by whom? You're to help. - You're a bore! Thank you. Hello, Connor! Hello! Jimmy, here in London! What a surprise! Sit down please. To what circumstances do I owe the honour of this invitation? Now, Connor, I just wanted to set your mind at ease about this case in Panama. Panama? Something wrong there? Afraid not. I wanted to tell you that we haven't got enough evidence against you. How kind of you! Mr Flynn and I were just speaking about the death of your mutual friend massay. Yes, very distressing. Of course... Yes, you weren't involved, but it does seem very peculiar that one after the other of your acquaintances are dying off: Prigeot shot in the cinema, massay thrown into the canal... One might be inclined to ask who of the recipients... Of real's millions will be the next? Obvious, isn't it? But there's another person who real has designated to be his heir: A young woman. Oh? Unfortunately she seems to have vanished after arriving in town. She never arrived at her hotel. Scotland yard is looking for her. Then Scotland yard will find her! Yes, they will. Connor, you bring miss Kent to the Victoria boarding house! And if you harm one hair on her head... Why should I be involved in all this? Than I do think we do have enough evidence on you in the Panama case! Thank you, gentlemen. I say that massay wanted it all for himself. How do you know he was alone? You mean Connor? I'm not saying that. But lizzy disappeared, too. Connor's here, but not alone. He brought mr Jim Flynn. Jimmy? - Yeah. Gentlemen, for those of you who don't know him: This is mr Flynn! Very happy to meet you. Let's get to the point: Mr Flynn is interested in the same things I am. I mean: As we are. He has much to offer and demands much in return. Jimmy? Gentlemen... I offer you my partnership. That means you get certain information that I possess. Furthermore there are certain matters... Which need my brains. I have an excellent plan. But we must be honest with each other. The first part of my plan is... That the girl being held here must be set free. Hm, it must have been good. Yes, indeed it was. Help me! Johnny, get me out of here! Who'll give us a guarantee that there is no old guts behind this thing? Flynn has a very good relationship with Scotland yard. I could accuse Jimmy of collaborating with the police, however... You wouldn't do that, would you? You know me, Connor! Yes, but inspector angel has threatened to take action in the case... That we keep the girl here any longer. Why should we expose ourselves to that? She can go wherever she wants. Bring her here! The girl has escaped! She must be still in the house. The main entrance is locked! What? Yes, she threw pepper in his eyes! Shut up! Go get her. Search for her in the cellar. Very well done! What do you mean by that? That you don't fool me! Well, you don't mean... Do you really think I'm pretending? Would that be a heavy burden to your conscience? Bring me the girl! I have her! I tell that she's here! Was here... Wait now, believe me. I'd be stupid to try such a foolish stunt! Why would I give you a story? Why wouldn't you, my friend? There! We searched for you because mr Flynn wishes to speak with you! Miss Kent, I am here to take you away. You see a travelling companion can be more useful than a legal advisor. It's time, come. What does this mean? What do you think it means? Hold it! Kathleen, come over here! Get your hands up! Get over against the wall! Come on, move! Connor, don't forget that I am an excellent marksman! Hello, Jimmy. - Hello, angel. Playing a game with your friends? Yes, it keeps them occupied! This is angel, Scotland yard's brightest young man, and clever too. How do you do? Hello, inspector. Mr Flynn will take you back to your hotel. Mr Connor, I am tired of playing games with you, now get that light back on! Mr Flynn! Come with me! Now this is your last warning! Alright, it's all over. It's no use! Turn on the lights! I thought I send you to dartmoor for 20 years for murder? I've never forgotten what you did! Somehow you always end up... In the cellar with the rats! Oh, go wash your face. You're a frightful mess! Put that away! Connor, I could put you and your... Friends away, for some time to come, but that would be premature. Do you really think you could do that? I can. And as for miss Kent, you won't touch her, will you? You ought to tell that to Jimmy! = thanks for the advice! I'm glad you've arrived at last. Mr westlake drove us all quiet mad. Please get miss Kent's room ready, and tell mr westlake we've arrived! You must be exhausted. Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment. Please sit down. - Thank you. You do look pretty exhausted! Of course, it's to be expected, considering... Everything you've been through! You've been very considerate. Oh, let's not talk about it. We must! I can't seem to put together... All the pieces. You seem to be with the criminals, also with the police? My business is with both, and yet not everybody... There is something I have to say. It's very important. Your father was an acquaintance of mine. He was? Yes, I was a croupier in the place where he gambled and lost his fortune. No - yes. I made every effort to stop him, Kathleen, but he wouldn't listen. Even after I told him that the ball was controlled by a magnetic device... He wouldn't believe me! He didn't believe in the technical genius of real, the man who wants to make up for what he did to your father! Why must people bring up the past? Because they have too. Allow me to help you if I can, Kathleen. Miss Kent! Miss Kent! Oh, what a joy! Did the police finally get you out? I gave them a piece of my mind. And I see it got results! Mr Flynn did it! You? You got her out? I knew you were the police! You just don't want to admit. But when we were on the train, you see, an advisor of the law must understand... A good deal of psychology. Goodbye, mr Flynn. - Goodbye. Miss Kent, come, may I show you your room? I've thought this whole thing out, miss Kent! There is much more at stake here than your inheritance. Well, just rest for a while, miss Kent. If you need anything then just ring. Yes please. Yes, we'll do that. Where was 1? Ah yes! I remember as I was beaten, but more to that later. There was 12 or 15 against one. They threw me into the thames or so, they thought! Then there was the police. I made them believe they were not dealing with an amateur. Potential genius that one day will attempt to practice law! I'll soon know the facts. You see in order to solve this mystery... I need to make one more visit in order to gather additional information. Then... I can see you gaining your inheritance, and London is made safe again! Miss Kathleen, why do you cry? Was it something I said? Are you mad, angel? What tempted you to do it? You met with a band of gun toddling hooligans, and you let them go free. I'll issue a warrant of arrest! You shouldn't do that, sir! Real is in London, and Connor and his gang will find him, and we'll follow them! To find real we'll follow... This young woman or spedding! It's not that easy. Real has been cheating for 20 years now, and nobody has been able to find him once. Your speculations make my teeth chatter! Ah, lucky coin! A lucky miss that was, lucky me! Miss Kent showed up at the hotel Victoria. Good, spedding! Have you spoken with her? No, not yet! There would have been trouble. Flynn and inspector angel were always with her. Bad, spedding! I thought tomorrow would be better! I don't pay you to think! Listen to me: You are to bring me a document. Yes, mr real. The ming vase in the private study: Underneath is an envelope. I want you to bring it to me unopened. Do you hear me? And where, mr real? Wickberry mill, price village. Straight away, mr real! Spedding! - Yes, sir? You love life? Naturally, of course! Then make sure that you don't open it! I thought real was a gambler! But he's a murderer... And a clever one! They don't build these things... The way they used to. I don't like this! A man could get killed! Quite a hole! Not even a warning! That wasn't fair at all. A lock and key would have been sufficient. I'll get you yet! Oh! Pardon! Looks like an electric eye gadget. This can't happen to me! Hello? Hello! Working so late? Yes? What do you want? Are you nervous, spedding? What are you doing here? Seeing you stay honest! You know a fortune could spoil the best in all of us! Now put the paper over there! Are you threatening me? = oh no. I am merely interested in seeing that the money miss Kent deserves... Is handed over to her. I'm to deliver this myself! I'll deliver it for you. But... I protest! So protest! Well? I wouldn't run if I were you, spedding, one dies so quickly! Thank you! No. No! Oh, mr Flynn! Wrapped up like a parcel. Are you cash on delivery or a free sample? If you don't get me out of this I'll give you a free sample! Don't get excited now! I guess it was a wrong number. Mr real, let me out! Let me out! Let me out! I want to get out! Real! Disguised as police we blow the safe. And Jimmy can look after Kathleen Kent. That will keep him out of the way! Sound alright? Ok, Connor. At least it's an idea! I'd say it's high time. I agree! Here are your schedules, gentlemen. I'd like some more details, Connor. I'll explain later! Come on! Connor, are we taking a big car or a small one? That was for me! Take him away. He was shot with a high-powered rifle. He wasn't killed where we found him. What's his name? No identification papers on the body. In the underworld he was known as "cyrill", one of Connors men. There you are! If you'd capture them there wouldn't be a "corpus delicti". Did you find anything on the body that might be somewhat useful to us? Only this piece of paper with these numbers and a few addresses. No date? - Only 710. Do you think it might be a plan of some sort? Today is the 6th, tomorrow is the 7th of October... What are you thinking? I believe we are on to something! What do you mean? What's the matter with you? I'll tell you when I get back. You said you wanted the facts! He'll get the facts... Maybe he will? What do you want? To talk to real! Don't talk nonsense. I have to tell him something important! What are you going to tell him? What do you care? Margaret! Margaret! Who's there? I just wanted to talk to you, real. Are you ill? I wouldn't give you the satisfaction! I felt obligated to look after you, since you have been so careful to look after... My interests together with my capital! So you want it, do you? That's it! But besides that, I would like to know how to open the vault... And I shall! You opened many safes in your lifetime. Go ahead and open this one! I won't kill myself! Ah... our old table! Do you gamble with yourself, real? Let me see if I still remember how it operates. I won, real! You lost! You're going to come with me to lombard street right now, and your going to open up that vault and give me my money! The police! They just drove up outside! They've come for you, Connor! Come, I'll show you the way out. Don't rush off, Connor! Stay a while! Very clever story about the police coming. Very clever. And so Jimmy, I'm sure that Connor wants to clean out that vault! He wants to, but he can't. Haven't you heard about any plans? He wouldn't tell me about them! I wish I could help you but... I know you had Kathleen Kent's security in mind! What's wrong with your neck? I can tell you that! Mr Flynn is an expert in the matter of wrapping. He uses a phone very well, or parts of it. That's just Australian humour. You may call it that. It's high time we get to the bottom of this situation. We already have, mr westlake. Jimmy, I think it's best to have spedding... Take you and miss Kent to real. I have reason to believe he will follow the bent of his own thoughts. I left a message for him to call me, but he hasn't returned the call by now. Perhaps he didn't receive the message. Hello. - Hello. I can see you're feeling better! Although you haven't got your money! But she thinks of it. Money isn't the only thing that exists. For some it is! Miss Kent, you look ravishing! Mr Flynn... Though I do agree with Jimmy, I must get on with more important things. 1 do agree. What next? Miss Kent, you must see real. You know where he might be found? = I'm afraid not! If you haven't found out, I suppose I'll have to tell you! Jimmy, sometimes I feel that you know quite well... The whys and wherefores in this entire case. Haven't you heard from Connor? When he comes we'll be gone. Now be ready for my signal. I want the explosion 3 minutes later. Stop just a minute, be sure you get out in time! When you're all set, let us know! Be careful, my friend! Anything wrong? No, everything is just fine! Got a match? Went out! Hello? Good show, old boy! - Thank you! Spread out! Come on, come on. Stop that, go over there! Anything wrong? No, nothing. Dynamite ready? Yes, won't be long! We're ready! Shall I set the clock? We'd better get out! Hey, you! Oh, it's you! - Yes, it's me. Hold it! We're the police! Now we may proceed to act, sir. Oh, thank you very much! Move it! Over there! Let me go! Inspector, in a minute the house will blow up! We'll all die! The clock is running! Alright, come on out! The house is about to be blown up! Bring that man with you... hurry! Faster, faster! Move, gentlemen, your vault awaits you! Have you seen mr westlake? No, sir, I haven't! Have you seen mr westlake? No, I haven't. Hey, hey... - That young man... They couldn't have gone home already! Mr westlake! Ferry! Westlake, are you crazy? This house is going to blow up! I've already deactivated it! This way. Mrs Clayton, but why are you here? Mr real is waiting for you. Margaret, has she come? Yes, she's here, mr real! Then come up! He's up there. He's dying, my child! Kathleen, yes, of course! Leave us alone. I said leave us alone. Kathleen, come here! Calm yourself, mr real! I'm not excited. I'm happy. I will never forget the look on your face after your father died and I took... All your possessions. I bet he wouldn't come. He wanted to teach you of your fortune. He thought I forgot the combination to the vault, but I didn't. He won't have much luck for all I possess is yours! Will he tell her how to open the vault? I believe he will, mother! You must make sure that she gets... Everything that is coming to her. She will, mother! You did good work, little brother. I'm proud of you! Here, take this envelope. I'll make you rich! It's my last will... And testament, the combination to the vault. Don't give it to anyone. They all want to have it. Kathleen, all of them! I'm so... He's dead! I would like to leave, please. Come along with me, my dear. It's been all a little too much for you! A little refreshment will do you some good. Give me the combination to the vault. What did you say? Give it to me! Please don't! Please, leave me alone! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Help me! Miss Kent! No, he's my son! No! Out of the way, mother! Spedding! This says if you please... After you! - Thank you! Here is the vault. All of this now is yours, miss Kent! No, I don't want it. I don't have to take it, do I? I must inform you, miss Kent, of all your legal obligations in this matter, § 9 of the British... I'll come back in a minute. I'm just going to fetch some... Dynamite!
