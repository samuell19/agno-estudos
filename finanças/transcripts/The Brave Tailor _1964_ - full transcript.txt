Seven at one stroke! A Strongman doesn't get his reputation in vain. Seven at one stroke! A Strongman doesn't get his reputation in vain. Seven at one stroke! A Strongman doesn't get his reputation in vain. Seven at one stroke! What's happening? - A miracle! We've been watching it for half an hour now. A odd phenomenon, call it wondrous. glance over, youngster! What do you see? - I can see smoke. It's an unexplained phenomena. Maybe doomsday's upon us? Why, yes, just imagine, it suddenly took off and began to smoke? Maybe a forest fire? - Woods do not burn in spring. And the smoke is of a different color. - Maybe a Volcano? But in fact, it was... so in fact it was... a giant smoking a pipe! I've grown somewhat bored. I've grown somewhat bored. My sides grew numb and my stomach grew fat. So lets descend this hillock and have a look at the people down there. I have a look at the people and show myself. They say that giants just have grown too big. They say that giants - are just dumb. But can't a dumb-ass surmise? But can't a dumb-ass grow smart? Does anyone ride on carts without horses? Hey look out! Clear the tracks and don't get in my way! I'm tired of riding! I swim. Take a refreshing dip. Nice! In a cheerful mood the giant goes from village to village. It is said that giants just have grow too big. They say that giants - are just stupid. A fool with wit and sense of business! Who walks dandy: A hat with a stick and a flag fanning on top of it. Oh, yes I am! Oh, yes I am! Yes, it was my idea! Oh, yes I am! Oh, yes I am! Yes, it was my idea! It is said that giants only have grown too big. They say that the giants - are just stupid. What are you saying? - What you just heard. I will crush you, insolent! Where are you? - I'm here. Just you wait! I'm not here, but behind you. Where are you? - At your feet. Hold on! - I'm holding on to your boots. But not this one, but that one. Oh, everything is spinning, everything is floating. Cuckoo! Ahoy! Oh, I'm choking, I can't anymore. You need rest and relaxation. Tell me, impudent, who are you? Who I am? Take a look here if you please, your honor! I hope, at least that you can read. "A Strongman doesn't get his reputation in vain. Seven at one stroke." Such a show-off I never saw before. Take of your high hat and move aside. You try to squeeze water from a pebble. And then he says you're a strong man. While you squeeze the juice from the stone, you also soak the stone with your sweat. And, Incidentally, you crushed the stone with both hands. But here's a stone. I'll now clench it with one hand. Indeed, you came out to be the winner. You posses strength it seems. Well now, let's see who's best at throwing stones... the furthest up in the air. Well, buddy, what's up? Thought you'd throw up higher?! Well, I am stronger than you. Take the cow off the roof! Take off your hat! Put it back! And don't damage the front. Well, what are you standing all lifeless and bare-headed? Put on your cap again. Otherwise it'll be chilly. The giant walked away with heavy steps. Giants can not forget their shame. So the giant crunched his brains To come up with a plan to destroy the tailor. Excuse me, I'm very confused and embarrassed. to renew our acquaintance, I ask you to share a simple dinner with me and share my modest accommodation. So where do you live? I live on that hill, in a cave together with my cousin. With one hand he pressed lightly While I hade two hands and ... He threw a stone into the clouds, and the stone did not return. With such a man it's dangerous to wage war. He's bound to have more tricks up his sleeve. We'll have to take up his bed and shake the guy off into the abyss. - Come on! - Be quiet, do not wake him up! - Well, he sleeps. - Hush, just wait a minute! You tend to do everything with impudence. I did not hear any snoring. Now he's asleep. - He fell asleep now. Quietly! Don't bump against the door! It's like he stopped snoring. Yes, he does not snore. We'll have to sing a lullaby, so he won't wake up for another hour. And with a bass they started: Sleep, baby in his crib, Baiushki-bye. Sleep well, all right, Baiushki-bye. Sweet and sour is our baby, it will sleep through the night. And in his little bed even a flea will doze away. Even the little mouse will stop running around. One, two, three! Good-bye, baby, bye-Baiushki. It is said that giants only have grown too big. They say that giants ... - are just stupid. It is impossible to understand. It is impossible to understand. Let's carry the bed back. Cheated were the giants by the brave and cunning fellow. Before us is the palace. The Royal Palace! There a portrait of the king, with his royal crown on, is painted by the Royal artist in the residence. What do you think? Well, now? The nose looks alike. My mouth looks alike. The mustache is fine too. But in real life, I look younger. No wrinkles on my face, Yet in the mirror I look like a 200 years old man! Remove all mirrors from the Palace! and hang all mirror-makers please! - Do I make myself clear? - you do. Then get a move on! I beg your pardon, maestro, go on! Excuse me for interrupting, Your Majesty! I come to tell a message, Your Majesty. A strongman roams the kingdom, rumors go. According to the most reliable ones he likes to help old women. He is a strong man with a fierce reputation. He struck seven at one blow. The guards can put the heat on him, Your Majesty. As he may even plan to come disturbing your Majesty. Catch the strongman and call the hangman! You can't : The hangman ran off, He tossed everything and hides under a bench. Send the army! All the soldiers are seized with a terrible panic. And the generals? The generals are hiding in dark cellars. I ask you not to become disquiet and remain in the same pose. One more stroke, and I will start with the background. Maestro, get the hell out! There is no way to proceed infallibly! We must act very cautiously. We need to lure him to the palace ... Hello, Your ... Splendid, brave man! I'm delighted to see for myself this fine young man, This,... how to say, this Catcher ... - And chaser after wild beasts. - ... Wild beast, and chaser. How did you get in here? Over the stairs and through the door. And why did the guardian not hold you back? He saw, he read, he ran away. - Twerp! - Never mind! You'll have to be tolerant. - Impudent bumpkin! I'm boiling with rage! - Try not to boil over. You didn't get his reputation in vain.. You struck seven at one stroke. We need such people for ... ... for fatherland and king. In a much frequented forest under a tall pine two terribe thieves have a hiding. They were searched for in the winter. They were searched for in the spring. But one didn't come across the villains. The king's men could not catch them. It's hard to arrest these scoundrels. The royal army was lucky to get away. This is very much as robbers like it. We live from robbery, with an ax or a knife. We turn people from living to death. You're a dashing fellow. You're a valiant and strong man. No doubt you can catch the robbers. There's another "poor water into a sieve" assignment. It will be fun you. In the forest live,s away from all tracks and roads a cloven-hoofed beast - a unicorn. Please, dear fellow, for God's sake catch and fetch that unicorn. He has put on weight like a cow , but brutalized many people. a large number were injured. But for you - it'll be nothing! He'll be easily to tame. Consider it done, Your Majesty. We cheated, deceived, cheated the strongman. He agreed, agreed, agreed too hastily. The soldiers can calm down and put on back their armor. And the deserting generals can slide out of their pits and cellars. And the hanging scaffolds and chopping blocks can be put back to work As the hangman will come out again. Do not come back you dumb-ass, Do not return you dumb-ass, He'll never return, this stupid, slow-witted strongman. We are the gentry folk. We are knights by nature. We are valiant warriors, we were awarded the honor to beat the vagabond. We hope for the best. However if worse comes to worse We'll watch from a hiding, so there'll be no bloodshed and then that strong man ... Oh! From us the strong man we will not hide. To quiet him forever. we swore, head-on! Did you nudge me? I'm not even thinking of a fight. You dreamed. If you're right, I maybe had a dream. In his dreams a man may see devils on a pine tree. What are you nudging me? What are you saying! Do not think, brother, that everybody is an idiot like you! Like me? That's it: Like you! And they started fighting like cats in a bag. Are you alive? Still alive.. How are your sides? Sore hips. We cheated, deceived, cheated the strongman. He agreed, agreed, agreed too hastily. And now he will not come back, he will not ever come back. We do not have to be afraid anymore. Everything's all right, gentlemen. We - dashing generals. We left our basements. And dance tru-la-la We are invincible, we are indispensable, we are the king's favorite servants. I'm the executioner disguised by the red death-mask. I braided a beautiful wreath for the strongman's grave. For the strongman from the hangman. For the strongman from the hangman. Clap your hands twice, stamp your feet trice. Let all of Europe cheer!. Let the kings of all nations of the earth cheer! In the palace light shines. The strongman isn't in this light. Oh, look! On the road, rushing in gallop, in gallop rushes the strongman riding the unicorn!!! Hey! Hey! I am a jester and a cheery fellow, a good and audacious man. If you are in trouble, I'll come to the rescue. Without fail I'll come to help what I can, if I can. A strongman doesn't get his reputation in vain. Seven at one stroke!
