What did you get done? Oh, a "swing analysis". Who did it? Marco! Now I get it! I have to go. I have to work on my own swing. When the tunnel is finished you'll be in Amsterdam within ten minutes. Who says you can't buy happiness? Living and holidays in one. An ideal combination. Excuse me. Sorry! Thank a lot. Gentlemen, Gijs will take over. I have a plane to catch. Good afternoon. Take a left... We've got a minor leg issue. - I'm coming. Satisfied? - Sure. One thing... Another glass of champagne? - Sure. I'll get it. I'll join you. We're expecting some turbulence. So please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelt. It was a real pleasure again, Mrs Meyer. - Gotta go. Gotta go. Surprise! Let's celebrate our six years together. We just did. Didn't we? It's time for a child. - Great ideal Let's adopt a Chink for 50 euro. - No. I want a real child. - What do you mean? Our very own baby. A baby? You're never home. - But you are. I don't want a baby. I'm perfectly happy. Just wait till you have a baby in your arms. Don't get your hopes up. I really need to think about this. No you don't. Throw the pill away and stop flying. I'll screw you daily till you're pregnant. Daily? - Yes. THE HAPPY HOUSEWIFE Lea, I got some advice. They say the artist is hot and prices are rising. It looks like a good investment... ...in the future of our child. - Mr Meyer, I love investing... ...but I'm not pregnant yet. You aren't? - No. Oh God, Mrs Meyer! What can we do? To start with, just sit down... Mrs Meyer can dust you down. This was the one, I can feel it. Let it sink in. Come on, ladies. Put the ball in the hole. Come on! Lea. - Hey, Marco. Long time no see. You're pregnant. Nice. I was just passing. Lea, are you okay? Out! Get out. - Why? I'm supposed to drop it on the green? - What about my gear! Can you cope? You're not in labour, are you? No! I'm not walking back! What do you think? Bye, Marco. Darling, this is for you. Because you're the first and that's really great. Great stories about water birthing. And they do it among the dolphins! - Sexy! Have babies! If I want to see a dolphin, I'll take the baby to Sea World. If it gets stuck, I'll have a caesarean. You'll be fine, you always are. Hop in. Mum, did I tell you I want Brigit to be at the birth? Just kidding. No really. You don't have to. No way! Did you notice? I haven't drunk for nine months. I'm having a baby. You have a name? - We're seriously considering "Kees". With a C for... or a K for knob? - The K for knob, of course. This is a worst-case scenario in my belly, Ma. Justin Case. Maybe he'd have loved a grandchild. - I don't think so! He hated children. They freaked him. Be grateful your kid will never meet his grandpa Kees. You're right. Let's drink to that. -I'm so down. I don't want to live. - That's enough, guys. Have some fried banana. Harry! Come on... Come on! Oil Come on. - He's not listening, really. What are you looking at? You think it's hot too! This is a strange time... - Stop whining. This is serious! An orgasm can induce labour. Can you manage? - Yes. I just can't always reach. This bit makes me horny. Sounds like you found it. - Damn it! God damn it! Is that your orgasm? - No, moron. It's a contraction! Honey, it's working. Here. Oh, Lea. It's starting. We're having a baby. I have to do rhythmic breathing. - Yes, go on then! I forgot that dumb old song! How did it go? Relax and breathe, Lea! Oh, that song! That goes smoothly. - Very good. You're doing great. Contraction over, Harry! How far have you dilated? Take off your pants. This is handy. Do we use this? "We'? It's a birthing stool, to help gravity. Try pooping on your back. I bore all my children on that. Tilt your pelvis and try to relax. Not bad. Three centimetres. - Three centimetres! I'm going home for dinner. Call if the contractions get to 5 minutes. Home? What about us? - There's nothing I can do. I'll fetch dinner. Italian, Sushi, Chinese? I'll go get it. It will be fun. Right? I got some Indonesian too. It might be a long night. These prawn crackers are great. - Thanks. How many kids? - Three. My partner Irene is having our fourth, in 5 months. Christ! Do you have to eat that crap here? Are you okay, honey? My pelvic floor is being torn asunder and you chat with a dyke about crackers! Jesus Christ! But I'm just fine. - Sorry. We'll leave you to it. Christ! - It can be hard for some. Can you manage? I can't get to sleep. I'll try the couch. Call me if you need me. - Fine. And? Am I a father yet? Nope. Get dressed. It's 6 AM. I'll call Machteld. Four centimetres. - Jesus! Well, ladies? - Four centimetres. Like this we'll get a baby next year! Keep your chin up. - Have you ever had 20 hours labour... ...for 4 lousy centimetres? Machteld, I want a caesarean. - That's a very serious operation. You'll need anaesthetic. - Great. I can't wait. Maybe it's hospital time. Her contractions are too weak. We're witnessing a unique biological event. A dilating woman. Judging by her face... - Get lost, Harry! She's aggressive. End of take one. This will induce contractions. It's quite powerful. They'll hit you now. All right. Bring them on. I'm ready and waiting. We'll have to help, or the baby will suffocate. I've suffocated for 24 fucking hours, but no one cares! Please, no cutting. - I have to. Push! Push, Lea. - You push, you fat dyke! What's wrong? - It's entangled in the umbilical cord. Just cut her open further. - Harry! Machteld, please. Easy, honey. It's too bad, but you need a gynaecologist. Good evening. George Clooney. - I'm Maurice Kallenbach. Lea Meyer. - Harry Meyer. Hello Machteld. We need more force, Mrs Meyer. You can call me Lea. Let's see. Heart rate? I'll see how far you're dilated, Lea. I remember. Almere! That's where you play golf? You too? - Yes. What's your handicap? - Twelve. Yours? - Eight. Can we talk about my handicap, Maurice? I'm afraid there's no other way. - Not the scissors. Please. I don't want to be cut again! - You don't want to tear! I thought as much. We're going to try the vacuum pump now. It's just fine... It'll feel strange when I insert the cup. Press on the next contraction... Lea, Push. - I can't. Shit! It fell off. The head is probably malformed. It'll be fine. We'll try something else, Lea. You're doing great. It's for our child. - You mean your child. You wanted it. But you're not getting anymore. No way! What's that. Harry, look. I don't want that. Sorry. It's for our child. - Let go of me! Filthy Nazi! He's having difficulty breathing. Push. Harry, I'm sorry. Just get rid of it. Just get rid of it. No funeral. Let's just adopt a Chink kid. You did well, woman. Honey, look! He's a bit blue. And he's got a pointed head, but he'll be fine. I'm so proud of you. Don't drift off! Drink up. I have to drink less and eat healthy. I have to live to a hundred! I want to see it all with this little guy. - Hi, dears. Here I am. - Hi, Mum. What a cute baby! Hello there, gorgeous grandson. Can't you produce any milk? You have to persevere. Breast milk is the best for a baby. I nursed you both for a year. Say: "Hello, Granny." Stop it. You make me feel like I'm 80. Congratulations. I have to hold my grandson. Watch his head. - So you made it! You really had to work hard, didn't you? Henriette, let's go downstairs and have some cake. Bring your grandson along. His head will get back in shape, won't it? Look at him. Are you happy? The itsy, bitsy spider... - Why don't you put him in his crib? I'm afraid I'll lie on him. Of course. Come on. We're try out our own bed. Here's a nice warm bath for you. I'll add some Epsom salts. You have to sit on this. Get a good soak. That's good for your stitches. Careful. It's very slippery. Come on. Are you okay? Come on. Hold my hand. Would you like some cake? - No thank you. Junior doesn't want to be nursed? - No, Lea won't nurse Junior. Quite right. He's done enough damage. Are you really ripped apart? From front to back? - From front to back, yes. That's quite a picture. It makes giving birth look easy as pie. I know you told me not to. But only because you have no man and no choice. That's bullshit. I never wanted a child, with or without a man. Why not? Because! I have to get back to work. Hang on in there. - Bye. It's a magnificent ode to Father Leo. He was a Renaissance man. He even ran a hospital. But he wasn't an evangelist. Leo didn't care about the soul or the afterlife. He always said: I work with people who have to be happy now. That impressed me. - You've written a wonderful book: Leo: A Man with a Mission. I understand that Father Lea... ...Lea? - Father Leo, of course. He wants to be buried here in Santpoort, not in Indonesia. He wanted that: Back to his birthplace. So where should I go, Matthijs? - He's in the Kennemer Chapel. Right. The Kennemer Chapel. Cot it. Leo: a man with a mission. Lea: a woman with a mission. A man and woman with a mission. Leo. - Sweetie, what are you up to? It's the middle of the night. Go back to sleep, okay? Lea, what are you doing? I'm stirring soup, okay? You need your sleep. - I need something else. You just gave birth. - But you didn't. I just don't feel like it. Good morning. - Morning. Sleep well? MATTHIJS BREAKDOWN? Harry, don't you want to get back to work? Yes, but... ...I figured it was too early for you. - No. We've got Joke, right? She does everything. Really? - Why don't you go to work today? If you say so. Then I'll hand out the cake. Joke? Why don't you take a day off? My mum's coming round. She wants to play with her grandson. It's all right. I have to do the laundry, hoover and shop. My mum will do that. Really. She'd love to. Working is not a punishment. - I just want be alone. Okay? Al right. NO LOVE, NO SUFFERING Ouch. My stitches. Sorry. I have an appointment with Father Leo. Get out of the way. Leo, I'm here. Talk to me, Leo. Hello, little girl. What!? Come with me. Thanks a lot! I still don't know my vocation! Damn it. Is that your baby? Get lost! Little guy? What's up? Where's Joke? - I sent her home. Why? It's okay, son. There's something wrong. I don't feel well. Honey, the birth was a real trial. And you're hardly getting any sleep. Poor child. Look at this beautiful little guy we made together. Remind me how we made him, Mr Meyer. Lea! What about Junior? - He's asleep. Not now, Lea! - So when? You really must get some sleep. Goodness, you're cold. Cold. Are you okay? - I'm doing really well. It's just the two of us again. Just the two of us. Just lie still. It's fine like this. Everything's all right. Lea, that's fine, but I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Where is he? Damn it. Lea? Where's Junior? What did you do to Junior? Where could one hide a baby? Let's think. In the garbage or glass container? - Act your age, damn it. Damn it, Lea! Harry... If we get rid of him, everything will be alright. Come on, get rid of him and we can start over. You stay put. I'll go give him a bottle. Mrs Meyer, please... Your husband is very worried. It must be serious if he's worried! How are you feeling right now? How are you feeling right now? - I can hear you. I'm not deaf. Right now? I feel great. Yes, I feel just fine! Yes, I feel fine. I have a few stitches and they're quite painful. I have 500 of them, you see. Mrs Meyer. You put your baby in a box. No, not in a box. He came out of my box. I have to explain that to you? Calls himself a doctor! Excuse me. We'll call the Crisis Service. The Crisis Service, I presume? - That's right. I'm Dieter van Vliet. And you are? - No, I'm not. Pardon? - You're Dieter van Vliet and I'm not. Get it? You just gave birth, right? Was it a boy or a girl? A girl. I thought you had a son? - So why did you ask? Shit. God damn it. Where is he? Your son is in his crib. Your husband just gave him a bottle. Really? Don't lie to me. Thank God. Lea, why did you put your son in a box? - What? Jesus, don't you start too. - Your husband says... I'm completely ripped up. Do you want to see. - No thanks. Harry didn't do a thing. He just stood and watched. You didn't do a thing, asshole! Oh, my little guy is dead. He's dead. No, he's not! There he is. Ha, ha. You fell for it. He's only 3-days old and can't even roll over. I think it might be wise if you... Harry! Your husband will be here soon. We put Lea in isolation and gave her some medication. The medication usually takes about five days to kick in. We have to find the right dose, of course. And during a further admission, we may need to... Further admission? - Next week the court will decide... ...whether Lea can go home or has to stay here. A court case? About me? - That's right. With real judges? And white bibs? Harry, this is very important. What should I wear? Trust me, I'll win. I'm going home. - That would be great. Thank you. It'll be fine. - Hey, hot stuff. I just feel it. It'll be fine with this pink suit. We're going home. We're going home. Trust me. This is the way to do it. Act normal and we're out of here. - I'll be really professional. Mrs Helena Henriette Meyer has been admitted... ...and we are here to decide whether she has to stay here. Mrs Meyer... Your Excellency. I took them. I swallowed them all. Good stuff, by the way. Can I ask a question? How long will this take? We have a child to raise. The acute stage is over but while stabilizing, the psychosis may return. So it might be advisable... Please sit down, Mrs Meyer. Now you say something. Go ahead, Mr Meyer. Take it away, Harry. I think Dr Mulder is right. As my wife won't stay here voluntarily... - No way, Jose! Do you think your wife is still a danger to herself and her surroundings? No. Absolutely not. It runs in the family. Her father committed suicide when Lea was nine. How does my father fit in? Another question. My Dad was depressed as hell and I'm sunny. So what's the game? Or am I crazy? Was her father ever committed? - No. Her mother suggested it might be best to keep Lea her for a while. What? Bastard! Lea! Goodness, I must be mad! Good thing my husband had me locked up. Sorry... Harry, you can't leave me with these imbeciles!? I don't want to be there. Please, I don't want to be there. Take me home, Harry. Cynthia. This is Lea. You understand, Lea? I don't have time... Watch out! Calm down. It'll be alright. - Take it easy, Mrs Schreuder. That's her way of saying hello. Are you okay? - No. I have no idea what I'm doing here. - There's a day programme. And we do group therapy. I'm sure you'll be there. I'm sharing a room, but my insurance covers a single room. Sometimes we're short of space. But I'll see what I can do. - Please do. She's crazy. Lea! What are you doing here? Come inside. It's cold. Charles told me you were outside in the rain last night. Did you see someone outside? You knew him? Let's talk about your father. What? - Let's talk about your father. My father... He drowned himself in a lake. That was 20 years ago. We haven't heard a word since. No cards, no phone calls! A dead father is a father too. How profound! What? You want to see me cry? I never shed a tear over that man, so... You never cried for him? - No. Never ever. Beau. Can I ask little Lea something? - Little Lea? I'll see if she's here. Little Lea? Little Lea? The doctor wants to ask you something. Okay? What's it like not to have a father anymore? Good riddance to bad rubbish, my mother always said. Everyone gets four potatoes. I only get two. they're out to kill me. Why do you think so, Lidwien? - On 1200 calories you starve to death. Theo! Theo! Thank you Mr Zevenhoven. What's going on, Theo? - My house is too big. I get lost in all that empty space. I'd like to stay here for a while. - That's possible. Did you ever fly? - Yes. I was a flight attendant. - That's great. I'm Zevenhoven: Captain. Are you flying to Nairobi with us today? - What? Listen: they want me to fly that crate, but I can't. I'm stuck here. You're retired, Mr Zevenhoven? - But... Sit down. - This flight attendant is my crew! Why else would she be here? Perhaps you can explain why you're here, Lea? Beats me! - For swimming lessons? Swimming lessons? Your ring. - I just gave birth. I have Ground Zero between my legs, so I sit on it. Gave birth? ...to a baby? - No, to a dog, sketchpad! So you're a Mum? - A real doctor at last. What about my room? That single room we talked about? Take a seat, Enzo. Broccoli is just a cabbage with a university degree. Jesus was fond of it too. It's common to think you're Jesus. Maybe Jesus had a disorder too. Maybe there was a real Jesus before him, but no one listened. Suppose that our Jesus, the one from the year dot... ...had a delusion he was Jesus, but he managed to convince everyone. So he went down in history as the real Jesus. You see what I'm saying? Ping-pong? - No. Well, I'll just stay fat then. You should eat your broccoli. It contains vito-chemicals. It stops cancer. Don't do that. Come on. Harry and Lea's answering machine. We can't pick up the phone right now. Speak after the beep. Well, what a lovely blue friend you have. God damn it. No thanks. - Who are you? Harry is my husband. So you have a husband and a child? Fine. From your mother. Didn't she want to come too? You have a mother too? Just tell her she can come. I don't mind. It's time. - Really? Smoking's banned. Come with me if you want a smoke. I don't smoke. But you do have a beautiful wife. Why did I have to bring this? How are you? Just great. We miss you. Junior and me. I miss you two as well. Well done, Lidwien. I just heard Theo can go home. Why him and not me? Listen to me. I have a problem. I'm expected... - Not now, Mr Zevenhoven. Why can Theo go home and I can't? Theo's here voluntarily, you're not. - You're kidding! Are you here voluntarily, Theo? Why? Why don't you go home? - I'm sorry, but you seem not to be... ...aware of the gravity of the situation. I have to fly... ...or lose my job. The airline... I'll call our head of personnel. Okay? You'd do that? - Yes, if you sit down and shut up. In that case I have plenty of time. Question: Why don't you want to go home? It's empty and lonely there. Here are my friends, people who care about me. Nice friends! Look around you. You're a friend too. I see your pain and sadness, but I'd really like to help you. Lea? Beau? You laughed. Why? What did you feel? - Theo is fitting with me. I'm creaming my rubber ring. I'm nearly floating away. If someone's nice to you, it doesn't mean they're flirting. How about someone else? - John. Lea! Could you time me? Here's the ball. Isn't he here yet? Hey, handsome. He really looks like you. Your mother thinks he looks like you as a baby. For your sake, I hope not. You'll have difficult genes. Or nice legs. Sorry. Is that dark-blue Audi yours? - Yes. Can you move it? It's for disabled parking. III--- ...move it. Hey, little one. Little one. What? Did you ask Charles to keep an eye on me? Yes or no? Bye, little guy. Bye, little guy. This thing sucks. - Take it easy. You push too hard. I've had enough. - Come and have a look. Let's rock and roll, guys. Please, one more time. Magnificent, gorgeous. Perfect, a great new costume. We can show that off. Right? Darling, you can go home soon. Hang in there. When you get out, I'll take you to that new spa for a detox juice treatment. Get all those hormones back under control. Here you are. It was good to be here. I've got to go now. Hang in there. Bye. You too. My last session, Beau. We'll tinker with the good old Beau method. Go ahead, Lea. We'll do some family role playing... Lea, use the others to portray your family. What's the point? - Just try it without arguing. First choose someone to play you then place the others relative to you. You're me. That's no reason to be happy. Come over here. You're my mother. Come here. Then there's my husband Harry. Harry, Harry... You're Harry. Great fun! You stand here. - Why does he have his back to me? Because he doesn't trust me or want to fuck me. That's no laughing matter. My father... Sorry, Theo, you have to play my father. Come and stand here. What does that feel like, Theo? - Wasn't I dead? But in this situation you're allowed to feel something. I feel excluded, as if I don't belong. Well done, Theo. My father didn't want to belong either. Shit. He's going to cry. You know what? May I use you? Look: Here's my sister. This is my sister. Okay? - Damn it! Very good. Spitting image of my sister. Why her and not you? - She's the apple of your eye and I'm not. So that's easy. Cynthia? I don't want to stand here. - Me neither. God damn it. How do you feel, Lidwien? - I'm hungry. My mother feels alone, so you have to stand beside her. She cared care for you by herself. My father didn't do a thing. Sorry, Theo... What's the point of all this? I hate this assignment. Didn't you forget someone? No. - Beau, I know. I know. - She has to come up with it herself. You forgot Junior. Junior! My flight is delayed, so I can play Junior. I forgot Junior. Now I'm comforting myself. Can you describe your father? You remember what he looked like? I have a vague idea, but... You must have pictures of him? No pictures at all? And memories? You remember things he always did with you? All I know is what my mother told me, I think. Shall I come and lie beside you? It's great you can go home. Are you scared? I'd be scared too. Bye. - You can keep it. You did great. - Bye, Boris. Don't forget you still have lots to do. - I know! A dead father is a father too. If you run into problems, you can always come back. That's really tempting, doctor, but my family is waiting for me. For me? - They don't need water. That's sweet. Your things are in the car, SO we can go. Thanks, Beau. Bye, Theo. You will take care of her? Yes, sure. Take care. - Bye, Lea. Let's go. - Bye. You don't have to go home. Junior was out for a bike ride? No, he's sleeping tightly. I changed your clinic appointment. - Great. Did you remember to call that guy? Thanks for reminding me. Espresso, or would you rather a cappuccino? Cappuccino. Great. - I want one of those terrific machines. Hello, little boy. What do I smell? Hello, boy, did you do a big poo? Come with me. Isn't it great that your mum's back? She lost her way for a bit, but now she's back. You startled me. - Did I scare you? I missed you, Mrs Meyer. I missed you too, Mr Meyer. - You did? Show me... Shit. You stay in bed, I'll go. The Meyer residence. Henriette Cornelisse speaking. Yes, she's home again. She's still sleeping. We do what we can, Harry and I. Yes, I will. Bye. You had a good lie in. This little brat was awake at 5.30. Corinne just called. - Mum? Are there pictures of Kees anywhere? What? There must be old photo albums. No. Why? - It's just... What do you want with your father, for heaven's sake? Did you ever visit his grave? No. Why should 1? Where's he buried? He was uptown, but the grave's long been cleared. Why don't you leave him home? - Junior loves going shopping. Just leave him here. I'm not going anywhere. Harry and I thought it best not to leave you alone with Junior yet. Just to be on the safe side. Sweetie, go do something fun. Take your time. Call Corinne for a round of golf, or go shopping. A nice bike ride with Grandma. That's nice. I can't remember his funeral. - You weren't there. What? - Mum didn't want you there. But you didn't miss anything. Why do you suddenly want a picture of him? Just because. Do you have one or not? Yes. Downstairs somewhere. I just want to see if Junior looks like him. I hope not. Listen, I'll... I'll look, but not now. I have to finish this tomorrow. This way... Just go home. I'll call you. Hey, honey. Do you remember much? - Before Junior arrived? No, when you were a child. Not really. You know what I feel like? A week in the sun. The three of us on holiday together for the first time. I remember more and more about my father. I remember that on Sunday mornings... ...when my mother and sister were asleep... ...we went out in a boat to catch daphnia. He sounds like a nice father, doesn't he? Hey, son. Are you waking up? Come to daddy. And to mummy, of course. Hey, little one. The weird thing is... ...that for the last 20 years I never thought about my father... ...as being a nice dad. - So it's good you do now. Beau kept saying I have to mourn my father. Honey, enjoy this beautiful boy. Look at him. Look what a beautiful mum you have. Hey, Theo. - Lea. You came back? No, I needed to talk to Beau. Do you have to go home? - Yes. For the whole weekend. Good luck. Harry? Do you remember Theo? Theo's staying to dinner. Welcome. We have another eater, Mum. - That's nice. What's that nut doing here? Isn't he from that institution? Get away from there. We're having pasta. Do you like that? Theo used to be a science teacher. And then he had some problems. You don't like it? - I'm watching my figure. Theo is good at fretwork, aren't you? - That's for sure. You have to work my mother. - She frets! Get it? I really appreciate that I'm allowed to stay here. You're very dear friends. Thank you. And you look fine to me, madam. You don't need to fret. Are you comfortable? - Yes. It's great. Beau keeps saying I have to mourn. I'm just not sure how to. What's your father's name? Kees. Should I play Kees? Why not go to a funeral? There are plenty of them and they're always sad. Here: "Love is stronger than death." Marius Bernard Sluiter died at age 35. Theo, look at this. This colour will suit you. Here. Put it on and brush your teeth. Call me. You look terrible. What's wrong? I cried my eyes out. Right, Theo? Because I miss Dad. You miss him? What exactly do you miss? Thanks. Why are you both wearing black? - We were at a funeral. Of... - What's his name...? Marinus? Marius? Marius Bernard. - But it doesn't matter. We went to mourn. Lea finally mourned her father. You're mad as a hatter. Both of you. Yes. Are you coming, Theo? Isn't that Harry's suit you're wearing? - Yes. Shouldn't you give that back? Here. - Not outside, moron. I think I'm going home. I'll give it a try. You can keep the suit. It looks good on you. Bye, Harry. And thanks. Henriette said you went to a funeral? - Yes. I took a big step forwards today. I finally cried my eyes out. - For a complete stranger? No, for my father. - Act your age, Lea. You have all you need to be happy: a house, a son. You don't have to do anything but act normal. I'm coming to terms with losing my father. - Stop it. Really. I've had enough. No more whining about your dead father. No more mourning. I want fun in house. Come and have some wine. - My mum has to go. She drives me nuts. Right! And you'll take care of Junior in between mourning? Go on, say it! You don't trust me, do you? You won't leave me alone with Junior. - Are you surprised? If I hadn't woken up, he'd be dead now. And you'd be in jail for murdering him. You've been the centre of attention for weeks. You've no idea how we feel. This is driving me crazy. I've had it. I was married to a wonderful woman and now look at you. You look terrible. You don't do anything. No one's seen Junior yet. Your best friend is from an institution. You blather about a dead father. Your mother does it all wrong. But Henriette took care of my son... ...because you were too lazy to join in. Normal? Is my mother normal? My mother denies everything that hurts. She's in denial for anything tough. It was like that with my father for years and now you do it to me. Harry, I'm trying to solve something! I'm going to the gym. Brigit, it's me. Did you find those pictures yet? Make time. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Do you remember that last evening? - Why are you digging so? Do you remember anything? I'd been to summer camp and then... I don't know if I have that box here somewhere. Anyway... He came to my room a few times to tell me... ...he was happy I was back again. So he said goodbye to you? Maybe it's this one. That evening I went downstairs to use the bathroom... ...and then... ...he was at the piano with his headphones on. Weird. It's him. This is it. On this sombre day, the sun won't shine, but I love my little Lea. Look, Mum. Look at this. He did love me. "How much I love my little Lea." - That's a nursery rhyme. You lied. He did love me. - I never said he didn't love you. But not enough. - What? Why are you standing there? - You chased him out of the house! Why didn't you help him? - Your father should have never had kids. But he did and you too. - It was a mistake. People make mistakes, but you can correct them. So I wanted a divorce. What happened that last evening? Tell me! Did anything happen? Did he say anything? I just couldn't be in the same bed with that man anymore. Leave it, god damn it! When Brigit was away at camp, I could sleep in her bed. But when she came home, I wanted to sleep in my own bed. I put up a camp bed for him in the living room. And then? I heard a noise downstairs so I had a look. And there he was in the middle of the room. The bed was there, but folded up. And then he looked at me... ...with that accusing look of his. He said: I'm leaving. And then you let him go? You just let him go? You didn't do a thing. - I thought it was for the best. For all of us. He was a nasty man. But he was my father. I often wished he'd done it years before. Lea's gone. She was very upset. What do you mean "gone"? Where to? - She was hysterical. God damn it. Did she say where she was going? Did she take the car? Where's Junior? - Here. But, yes... she took the car. She should have stayed in that institution. She's not just a danger to Junior, but also to herself. She's got his genes and you can't fight that. She had exactly that same look in her eyes. And you just let her go. This is Lea's voicemail. Messages after the beep. I missed you, Dad. But I've always been there. I know everything. I didn't want to wake you that evening. You were sleeping so peacefully. I stood by your bed for 15 minutes. Lea. Jesus. Where are you? He did love me. Breakfast in bed, Mrs Meyer. He came to see us. He's travelling too, Mr Zevenhoven. Hold on tight...
