I want us to never forget that the future, while leveraging technology, lies in ourselves. It is us who will blaze the path forward, paved not with algorithms, not with software, but with values, with friendship, with common goals, and most importantly, with humanity.

NEWS ANCHOR:The American financial system is rocked to its foundation, as top Wall Street institutions topple under a mountain of debt. - After 2008, 2009, you had this really interesting period in U.S. economics where the economy itself was in a recession and we were looking for some way to get out of it, we were looking for hope. And hope was found in technology. And people were like, "That's the future. Tech is the future. It's going to be the lifeline that pulls us out of these doldrums." And at the time, you had a lot of sort of tech boosterism and techno-optimism. The idea was not just that these companieswere going to become valuable, but that they representedsomething really fundamental and beautiful about the future of human civilization. It was a period where you were rewarded if you could articulate a vision of your company that wasn't just going to make money. It was going to change the world.

And, uh, like many who've come to New York before him, uh, they didn't really work. ♪ orchestral music playing ♪ He had this idea called Krawlers, which was for babies so they could have padded knees. You know, babies have been doing fine for millions of years without padded knees. ADAM:Our tagline was, "Just because they don't tell you doesn't meant they don't hurt." [audience laughing] ALEX KONRAD:He's couch-surfing with his sister, who's had some success as a model. - What you see is what you get. ALEX:And I think Adam really loves the New York lifestyle, the nightlife. But professionally, he's kind of a dilettante. ADAM:I'm working in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and in the building there's an architect whose name is Miguel McKelvey. And me and Miguel are talking aboutdifferent ideas of real estate businesses. - I was attracted and interested in him because he was bringing energy to the room, and perhaps for him I could be a calming element and take in some of that energy that he had and reflect it back at him in an interesting way. ADAM:And we went out to build a business that's going to change the way people work, that's based on community and redefined success. RANDALL:And from minute one with their partnership, it was Miguel who was Mr. Inside and Adam was Mr. Outside. ADAM:The world has shifted. It used to be an "I" world. Right? iPhone, iMac, all about me, me, me. If you take the "me" and you flip it and you get the "we," you understand that we're about to change the way people work and the way people live, but more importantly, change the world. VIDEO NARRATOR:The kibbutz. A working collective in a free society. Invented, unique, contemporary. The most important social experiment of the last hundred years. RANDALL:Every great business has a founding story and WeWork's is excellent. You have Adam and Miguel, uh, two children of communes. Literally grew up in communes and, you know, one in Oregon and one in Israel in a kibbutz. And they wind up together with this ideathat they're gonna create a work commune. ADAM:When we thought of WeWork, one of the thoughts that I had in my head is, we need a capitalistic kibbutz. On the one hand, let's create a sharing economy where everybody shares. On the other hand, if you choose to work harder than others, you should also be compensated more. RANDALL:Like any narrative, it gets boiled down and distilled. And as the company evolves, the founding story evolves. But their founding narrative actually really did translate to a lot of their early business success. - I mean, co-working, as we think of it now, didn't really exist at the time. RANDALL: Before WeWork, the real big player was Regus. ♪ upbeat jazz playing ♪ - Welcome to Regus, the new way to work. A global workstyle solution for today's rapidly changing face of business. RANDALL:As corporate and institutional as you could get, with cubicles and dull colors. And walking into a Regus was like walking into the back of a dentist's office. ADAM:We started by taking buildings. We cut them up to small spaces. We built everything from glass. It was very communal. It's very see-through and transparent. We put in common spaces, and we basically created a community of small businesses, entrepreneurs and freelancers. And in that community, people are almost forced to help other people. And when you have a business community that's built on these kind of moral standards, everybody becomes more successful. - In January 2010, I went in to lead a networking meeting at 7 a.m., and that day the guest of a guest was Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork. When the meeting ended, we ended up standing next to each other, talking, and he said, "Oh, I might need a mortgage." I said, "Well, I'm opening the mortgage seat. I'm gonna go do something else." He said, "What are you gonna do?" I said, "I don't know. I want to do something that lights me up and makes me feel excited." And he said, "Well, I just took this building down in Soho. "I'm launching this concept called WeWork. You should come and take a look." ♪ calm orchestral music playing ♪ [bell chimes] Three days later on Monday morning, I started as their second employee. [whistles] I still have this email that Adam sent to me at one o'clock in the morning the night before my first morning. I woke up at 8 a.m. to an email that said, "Good morning, period. Let's build the largest networking community on the planet" And not even a period at the end. I showed up and we were three weeks before our opening day, where we opened the first half of one of the floors in our first building, which was 17 offices, and when I started on that first day, Adam said, "I want to open in three weeks and I want to be full with a wait list." [chuckles] And we were off to the races from the very beginning. [drill whirring] - I want to talk to the investors. I don't know who they are and where they're at, but they're looking at this.

I'm ready. - Okay. MAN: Action. - Hey, guys. This is WeWork, the world's first physical social network. Our mission is to empower the world through collaboration.

[clarinet playing] JUSTIN ZHEN:There's a saying that companies in Silicon Valley are founded in garages. In New York City, they're founded in kitchens. MAN: There it is. That's my new space. Yeah. JUSTIN:The thing that made WeWork more special or more attractive was just its marketing, right? - This says, "Do what you love." - Our friends who were doing their tech startups, they all worked in WeWorks. We didn't even consider any other co-working space. The thinking was, if you have a tech startup and you want it to be successful, you start it at a WeWork. - I love co-working spaces so much. So let's start over here at the snacks area. MAN: We have the snack area. Coffee, lemon water. "Do what you love." I love drinking coffee, so... I'm gonna do that. JUSTIN:Everyone wanted to be an entrepreneur. We all want to raise $10 million. - Our company is SmileBack. - Co-founder of UPlanMe. - Scroll Kit. - Consumer. - Handshake. - MyThing. - Spindows. - Scruff. - Yoink. - RoomHints. - The company is Beer to Buds. ALEX:WeWork embodied an optimism and this millennial excitement about how to work and how to do things together, do things flexibly and rebel against the office culture set by the '80s and '90s. It was almost like somehow being a member of a club, beyond just where your office building is. ADAM:The world is changing, the way people work is changing. If you're 22 today and you're out of college, you can't go and work for corporate America in the old way and you need a new solution. We're sharing the same space, we're doing different businesses. And we understand that, through helping each other, we can become more successful. MAN:How fast are you growing? ADAM:Very. MAN:What kind of numbers are we talking about? ADAM:We're talking about probably one of the fastest physical expansions that has been seen for the past 10 years. - When I got introduced to Adam through a friend, uh, I came in. I didn't even know the company WeWork ever existed. He went right to the point. He's like, "Look, we don't have a lot of time. "I have a campground upstate. I want to host an event. I need you to help me. I believe that you can help me." And then he told me the budget, and I said, "Well... "you know, your budget's not too great. "I don't know how I'm, uh, you know, gonna really pull this off and make a couple dollars." He said, "Don't worry, you know, we're gonna grow. "We're gonna be big. You're gonna stay with us. You're gonna do a lot of work with us. You'll see, you'll see, you'll see." - It's exciting, it's gonna get bigger. LIRON DAVID:Something about him stood out. I couldn't put my finger on it, but Adam's a very convincing guy. He's... He's got a big personality and-- I walked out of that meeting, I said, "Okay, I'll make it happen." [bird chirping, frog croaking] We pulled every favor... from equipment to performers. And within a couple weeks, produced what's now become WeWork Summer Camp. ADAM:Hello, WeWorld.

The friend reached out to me and said, "I have a friend who has a startup and he's looking for an assistant. Are you interested?" And I got connected to Adam.

And I had to go through many different communities, and every time you go to a new school as a kid, it's not an easy thing. ALEX:Adam's world view was heavily shaped by this kind of nomadic childhood and a desire to belong.

DON:...who think they can cure like the plague by touching your head. PASTOR: Oh, Jesus! - Like he literally had people bought in and he grabs in a room like that... - You're a creator, and you're a creator, and I know you're a creator.

DON:If you're 45 and you've worked at law firms and whatever, you're like, "Okay, this is different." But, you know, you're into it, you're there. You get down with what people are doing. LIRON:My experience with WeWork, it was like living in another world. It was living in a world where people were just happy. Right? They were happy to be around each other. What WeWork created was this environment of present existence and celebrating life with, with meaning. The world is a dark place, and this little cave of WeWork was my happy spot. - The only thing that stands in the way of achieving anything you want is just you. You know the most amazing thing... DON:At one of these events, I was sitting towards the back, and there was an older usher there. And it was an African-American guy. And he just started asking me some questions. And he was like, you know, "What's the company about? What do you do there?" And, you know, I'm answering his questions. We're going on and on, and he just kind of changed his tone of voice and he kind of looked down on me a little bit and he was like, "Brother, can I ask you a serious question?" I was like, "Yeah. Sure, ask me the question." He says, "Is this some kind of cult?" [gulls screeching] AUGUST URBISH:I had been to a couple of the summer camps, and I saw how much fun everybody was having within the We community. So then a friend of mine who worked for WeWork called me up and said, "Look... "WeWork is doing this new thing. "I can't tell you anything about it right now. "Um, it's going to be for the coolest people in New York, "and I promise you are going to want to be a part of it. Are you willing to break your lease to do this new WeWork venture?" Like... "Can I have a couple days?" And she said, "No, you can't have a couple days. I need to know right now, are you willing to break your lease for this?" Uh, and I said, "I guess... Yeah." Reluctantly. I said, "Yeah, I will do it." So a couple of weeks later, I got this invitation for what looked likeEyes Wide Shut, that Tom Cruise movie. Like, non-informational whatsoever. A time, a place, a date, and that's it, you know. "I'll see you there," basically. So I was like, "Jesus, okay." So I show up and Adam Neumann was there at this initial thing, and there was maybe 500 people in this room, and they revealed what was going on. WeWork is starting WeLive, that is all about this new way of living. And we had a very distinct opportunity to be the first people in there. I believed every word that came out of Adam's mouth. - The success of this will be if you guys feel like this is your home. AUGUST:He seemed like he was talking like a man on a mission. So I signed the thing and they got back to me and asked me to write a very sort of generic "why you should live here." "Why should we pick you?" Like I didn't know anything about WeLive, so I was essentially writing a book reportfor a book that I hadn't read. It's one of those things where you're like, all I have to say is, "Wow!" So, you know, I wroteway too long of an essay than I needed to. And, uh, shortly after that, I was... accepted. This was supposed to be a space where it's move-in ready. You don't need anything. So I packed a bag, just one big bag, like a drifter, and walked into the space. And it was... stunning, it was beautiful. You know, you walked in and everything was perfect. QUINTON KERNS:I was the first designer at WeLive. I moved into WeLive, because I was one of the first members to be a beta tester. And that meant that, for the first six months, there was a drastically reduced price. I had designed the space with my colleagues, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity, and it was really cool because you were living in this brand-new living situation. AUGUST:The Murphy bed was built into the couch. There was a little desk tucked into a corner that you could put your computer on. The whole thing may have been 200 square feet. Might have been 200 square feet. Like on a good day. But it was all about community. I think the initial group of people definitely fit a certain criteria. I mean, beyond being young with no actual responsibilities. - A lot of single people. Everybody was single. We actually had a saying that everything had to be designed to hold the weight of two people. AUGUST:Guess what all those people had in common was the ability to pause theirpersonal lives to try out this new thing. QUINTON:They appealed to the same WeWork generation of millennials. A lot of people worked at WeWork who lived at WeLive at the time. AUGUST:A very, very small percentage of us were outsiders, I guess you could say. The first six months, it was weird if someone left the building. If someone were like, "Hey, I'm going to a friend's birthday party," and the very common next question is, "Oh, which floor is it on?" QUINTON:That's one of the benefits of co-living is, you move in, you get friends automatically, you spend time with them. So it becomes your whole social circle. AUGUST:It all felt like everybody was really dedicated to making this idea work, this sort of utopian... society of living situations, without really thinking of the consequences of that. [thunder crashing] ♪ ethereal choral music playing ♪ [hooves galloping] RANDALL:WeWork wanted to become a unicorn. A unicorn is a company valued at $1 billion. That one beautiful unicorn that can return a hundred times your investment, that's how you're gonna make a lot of money as a venture capitalist. So the entire world of venture capital basically is on a unicorn hunt. Finding the next Uber, finding the next Facebook, finding the next Google, that's going to make you a billionaire just by picking and betting on the right horse, or in this case, the right unicorn. When WeWork was in its major New York growth period, there were a lot of big players who saw the potential. Venture capital firms saw this as a really great growth play but they had to move fast. -I liked him immediately. Adam's just a charming, charismatic person who is very persuasive to a lot of people. STEVE BERTONI:In many ways for investors, WeWork was the future of work. It became this poster child for this growing trend of flexible offices, um, kind of digital nomads. Another thing that drove these investors was FOMO, fear of missing out. They had seen what venture capital firms had reaped with all these startups, and they wanted to get in the action. For many people, WeWork was that next big thing. ALEX:WeWork was basically getting interest from seed investors who were thinking, "Oh, this is a small company. I'm gonna get in on the ground with a small check." And yet they had quietly already reached a billion-dollar valuation, i.e., one of New York's very few tech unicorns, and yet people didn't know this because they hadn't announced it. I'm like, wait a second. There's a billion-dollar startup in New York that everybody wants to be a part of and nobody has a sense of how big it is yet. And so that's when I started spending a lot of time with Adam, to try to understand the company.

MORT ZUCKERMAN:I saw what he was doing. I made a judgment as to this man's leadership capabilities, which are truly extraordinary, okay? It's phenomenal, and it's a great concept, and it's continuing to explode. - Taking these distressed buildings and flipping them in a new way, that was an insight that no one else had. And, you know, they're validated by the smartest people in real estate being like, "Wow! That was a really interesting idea. It may be really risky, but it's an interesting idea." Pretty quickly, the Kushner family, the Rudin family, and Boston Properties were all onboard with this idea. It was validating to the establishment and it was also validating to Wall Street. You know, JP Morgan leads a large investment in WeWork. - Adam loved to namedrop to people. And, I mean, Jamie Dimon is the world's... top banker, and he would tell people he was his personal banker.

I mean, three or four times, he was very-- - But it bothers me because the center of energy in this room is right here and no one's sitting there, and it's right in front of us. And it's these little details that we pay attention to, and this is why, this is how you bring people together, and we have people sitting there facing the wrong direction, and there's enough room for all of us to get closer. - The last... [laughter and applause] - I remember in the very beginning walking into the office and seeing Rebekah and looking at her and saying, "Your husband has an incredible vision." And she said, "I know. It's why I married him." ♪ - Are you okay? [exhales sharply] Oh, fuck, are you on drugs? - No. - Are you? - No! - What are you on right now? - I'm not on anything, Robin. [pills rattling] Fuck. LISA:Rebekah was Adam's wife, and she had an office with us because she was a filmmaker, an actress. [sobbing] ALEX:She is, uh, a cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow. You can't go far hearing about Rebekah or talking to Rebekah without that kind of coming up. LISA:I went to a screening of a film that she created. We all went to the screening. - This is your entire life story? - That is my entire story. - No, it isn't. - It was interesting. ALEX:She's around from the beginning of WeWork, helping in unofficial ways. ADAM:I meet my wife, I was 28. This was 10 years ago, and she looks at me and she goes, literally within five minutes, "You have a lot of potential, but right now you're full of shit." [audience laughs] "You have potential, but you're full of shit." "You, my friend, are full of shit." "You have a lot of potential, but you're full of shit." [audience laughs] She said, "Find your passion. "Do something that actually changes the world. "Bring those two together, I promise you, you'll have the best business you ever imagined." I have to say I did all of that and, Rebekah, I just want to say thank you. - Adam, my love. - I'd be nothing without you. HOST: Well put. - Thank you. ALEX:I would go to interview Adam. Rebekah was there for a lot of the interviews. REBEKAH: Sweetie, can I just say something? How do I pause this? You don't need this. - She was, um, grilling me about my intentions with the story. - Really by putting 400,000 square feet of room-- REBEKAH: You're saying WeWork is gonna make the neighborhood cool? - It's gonna make it work. It's gonna make the neighborhood, period. WeWork is gonna make the Lower East Side the new Silicon Valley. ALEX:Clearly she had a lot of authority, but she was not considered at the time a co-founder. It's pretty clear that Rebekah's trying to sort of shape Adam, or help him become this world leader type that, you know, he aspires to be and that she likes. MEGAN:Working at WeWork, we all felt like, "Oh, wow. "This is such a special place to be at a special time, because as it grows, they're gonna need, they're gonna need us." HOST:You're a hard-driving CEO. We've seen with other hard-driving CEOs and companies with a lot of hours that, that the culture can crumble. I was watching a video of yours where the typical Monday was described as arriving at 7 a.m. and going home at 3 a.m. - This Monday, I finished at 2 a.m., not at 3. [host laughs] It was a good, it was a good Monday. - I thought I was going to work at WeWork for the rest of my life. I really thought that this was my lifetime career and I would just grow with the company. - If you build an amazing culture, one that people can give you feedback, one that works hard but also has a great time, then you will deal with the tough times when they come. And that's, that's what's really important, and if you do it right-- By the way, working hard is fulfilling. LISA:We would hustle so hard. And though we would hit the mark, there was always a way that Adam grew the vision, so that everyone could see that we could do more, hustle harder, hustle faster. MEGAN:When somebody tells you they're changing the world and you are helping them do that, it feels special. it feels really special. Everybody was just on it, ready to be a part of this company, to be part of WeWork, to be a part of the dream. At that time, we were also being told like... Adam told me I was gonna be a millionaire. DON:Most people agreed to salaries less than they would make at somewhere else in a regular field or whatnot, because you were given a salary and a certain value of stock options. - When your business has a mission, and that mission is world changing, and people can buy into the mission, then they're gonna come in. Then they need the culture that they're going to enjoy. To create that culture, you got to put employees first. We've given every one of our employees equity, so everyone is a partner in this business,from the porter that cleans to the community manager, to the CFO and COO of the company. Everyone is a partner. [chanting "WeWork!"] DON:So the idea was, people get super rich off of stock options, right? You hear about the guy who went to work at Amazon. He worked in the warehouse. He was like the 40th person in. He became a multi-gazillionaire. So that's what was being sold. But the way the stock options worked was that's not really like what would happen. MARGARITA KELRIKH:"Equity" was kind of a buzzword. Adam would talk about it all the time. "You all have equity in the company." Which I don't think is quite true. If you have stock options, you don't actually own equity in the company. You own a security that gives you an option to buy equity in the company. I would see that people didn't understand about that you're taking in what you're getting. It's so exciting... to feel like you own something that is so famous and so talked about. So that they can say like, "Oh, I have equity." But if somebody actually did the math, maybe their equity's worth like $2,000. You might think that the possibility of getting a million-dollar payout is far higher than it actually is in reality. [audience murmuring] ADAM: There's a lot of room. You can sit next to the gong. Don't be shy. JOANNA STRANGE:WeWork onboarding meetings were on Monday mornings. And everybody would come in and then a presentation would begin. And the presentation was the mythology of WeWork. ♪ peaceful symphonic music playing ♪ Like Adam walking through a kibbutz in Israel. Like his hands grazing over lavender, as he thinks to himself with a narration about community and support and loving one another. Then we get Miguel like walking through his compound in Oregon. They didn't do that; that's what they should have done. They should have hired me for that. But anyway, um, you know, kind of this... But it's definitely like a couple of slides about WeWork and then lots of slides about every single person at the C level. [cheering] DON:At some point, they changed the organizational structure to have like mini CEOs in different regions. And they call them C-We-Os. So... [laughing] I'm not kidding, you know, and I was like, "Look "I'm not referring to anybody as a C-We-O for my entire life." And they made some weird videos. JOANNA:Everything about the videos was propaganda. Everything about it was propaganda. DON:The tone-deafness and lack of awareness to show these videos, it was incredible. Basically, you had the CEO, you had all the C-We-Os, and you really didn't seeany minorities up in the higher echelons. There wasn't proper diversity at WeWork, period, hard stop. JOANNA:The C-We-Os are people who just want to talk about their awesomeness. They have that very much in common with Adam. It was almost like you needed to know who was at the top so when they came past, you could bow down to them. The events themselves really were meant to kind of like engender a loyalty to WeWork. DON:There would be like 50 to 70 people starting every Monday, and you'd be sitting in your office, and all of a sudden you hear chanting throughout the entire building. [crowd chanting "WeWork!"] JOANNA:While we're all trying to do our work. It's deafening. The music and everybody screaming. [crowd screaming, clapping] They were willing to spend any amount of money to make themselves feel good and look good to their employees. [crowd cheering] [cash register dings] DON:The offices were, to put it mildly, they were cramped. The mantra we got from on top, and I specifically remember an all-company meeting where we were kind of told that we would be quadrupling up, quintupling up, sixing up. "You don't need the corner office anymore. "You don't need the house on the hill anymore. It's all about energy, togetherness, working with your fellow humans." And then meanwhile, you know, I slide by Adam's office and he's got a veritable palace in there. There's a little bit of hypocrisy to all this. You know, I remember at some old company speech, it was about, you know, taking some small steps to make sure that we saved a million dollars on the operating budget every year. And then Adam just bought a $60 million private jet, right? So, you know, you hear these and you're kind of wondering like, what is the message that's being told and how are people really living? JOANNA:There was definitely a lot of chaos and lack of organization at WeWork. Multiple times, I end up doing other people's jobs. Because they're not working fast enough. So then eventually my supervisor writes his password on a Post-It and he hands it to me. I used his log-in for everything. I was logging in and out so often that more than once, I would click on his Gmail icon and end up opening his email, only to realize it's his email and then have to log back out of everything and have to log back in. And, you know, one day a title of an email caught my eye. And then sort of the rest, as they say, is history. [clicks]So I click on it, of course, and it's a list of people that he's gonna fire. And I'm on the list. But when you read further down in it, you realize that it's a mandate to cut 7% of their employees. Because WeWork was just flushing cash down the toilet. Just hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging money, so we had to cut jobs. He wrote something like, "Ha! Bitches, I cut more than 7% of my team," 'cause everybody was supposed to cut 7%. And I was like, "What?" After I saw that email, I thought, well, he gave me his password, and so I went digging because I thought, okay, I know we're running out of money. Now they're laying people off. What's going wrong? When I go back in, one of the documents that I find, it was obviously, the information was not meant to be disseminated, but it showed that we had to adjust our revenue down by something like 80%. I didn't know if they were not gonna tell investors. They certainly were lying to every time they put out something in the media. - Are you actually turning a profit in the business? ADAM: We are definitely turning a profit. I'm bored of the businesses that don't turn a profit. I don't believe in them. I need a cash flow-positive business. JOANNA:nAnd so I thought, well, I'll just give it to somebody in the media and then it will go to the right place and then they will be taken to task for it. ALEX:When I went to try to report on this leak, you know, we get this statement from WeWork that the person has broken the law and that they're going to pursue this, and they kind of were trying to come off a bit as a victim in the leak. They kind of said, "Okay, well, some buildings have been delayed, but we can sort of paint the overallnarrative that things will still be fine." And they had these really powerful backers who have pumped them with money, and so I think at that time it was hard to say... are they faking it till they make it a bit and things are gonna work out? Will they grow up and kind of figure out these problems? Or is this a runaway train? And then all that gets kind of tossed out the window when just a few months later, SoftBank enters the picture. [reporters clamoring] MAN 1: How's that? MAN 2: That's good. WOMAN: Much better. MAN 1: Yeah. [camera shutter clicking] WOMAN: Okay, you guys have 60 seconds left 'cause I hear the money counting. - Masayoshi Son is the founder and CEO of SoftBank, a large holding company based out of Japan. Known as Masa. He is one of the richest people in Japan. In 2017, Masa raised the largest venture capital fund of all time. It's called the Vision Fund. MAUREEN FARRELL: The size of the Vision Fund was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. It was $100 billion. That essentially equated to several years' worth of every U.S. venture capital fund. You put them all together and it's around that size. MAN:So when you told people you were gonna raise a hundred-billion-dollar fund, what was the vision that you actually gave them? - So, one vision, which is singularity. Singularity is the concept that in 30 years, computers, artificial intelligence, they will be smarter than us. That's my belief. ALEX:The singularity has a lot of implications for how technology will be used by society, and I think it also represents this massive existential threat where someday our creations will outstrip us and not need us, and we will be living lives dictated by machines. - So we are investing a hundred billion dollars just on one thing, AI. ALEX:The Vision Fund could basically play king, and Masa was going around looking for markets that he thought could be really high growth and companies with a potential to morph into something to fit his vision of the future of the singularity. And Adam wanted WeWork to be part of this huge vision. - Adam Neumann and Masa Son had met many times. However, Masa had always thought that WeWork was overvalued and it would be too easy to replicate. - The sharing economy's the future. If I treat you the way that I wanna be treated, then we can actually make a difference and be successful. STEVE:But because of Adam Neumann's charisma, Masa Son arranged to meet with Adam for this big two-hour tour of headquarters. Adam has been preparing for this for weeks. And he's pacing around, pacing around, watching his clock. [second hand clicking] Fifteen minutes goes by, no Masa. [balls clinking] Half an hour goes by, no Masa. [pendulum clicking] A full hour goes by and he's still looking at his clock. Finally, Masa shows up, and he says, "Adam, I'm so sorry, I'm late, but we only have 12 minutes." And they're going through WeWorkand he's giving him the super-speed tour. At exactly 12 minutes, Masa Son looks at his watch and he says, "Adam, I'm so sorry, but I have to go. But," Masa said, "if you'd like,you can ride with me to my next meeting." So Adam grabs his iPad with the whole WeWork SoftBank pitch, and they jump in the car. Adam pulls up his WeWork pitch, and Masa says, "I don't need the pitch deck. Let's just talk." Masa turns to Adam and he says, "Adam, let me ask you a question. In a fight, who wins, the smart guy or the crazy guy?" And Adam says, "The crazy guy." And he goes, "You're right, but you're not crazy enough. "You gotta be the crazy one. "You need to think bigger. You need to think 10 times bigger." And Masa begins, you know, doodling his vision for WeWork, this grand plan to take WeWork global. So basically Masa Son gave Adam Neumann a check for $4 billion and said, "Go crazy." And that changes everything. MAN:The Wall Street Journal is reporting that SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm, is considering putting $4 billion in your company. Is that accurate? - There is nothing I can say on that topic, but that sounds like a big number. [woman laughs] - That would be nice, wouldn't it? - Sounds big. ♪ suspenseful music playing ♪ [camera shutter clicking] [cash register bell rings] ♪ music tempo increasing ♪ [train wheels clacking] [chanting "WeWork"] - I don't remember the exact moment I first heard about the SoftBank investment. You would hear rumors. And to me it just seemed normal, you know. They were raising money every year. Their growth expectations were really high. I didn't think it would be... as transformative as it ended up being. ALEX:With the SoftBank money, WeWork is able to massively accelerate global expansion plans. SoftBank unlocks Asia in a new way. You know, this meets Adam's big ambitions. DON:I mean, the growth was insane. In the two and a half years I was at WeWork, I negotiated more deals and spoke to more lawyers than I probably will the rest of my life. QUINTON:Typically on a project you wanna make sure it's photography-ready. You want it to look perfectly staged. You wanna have a good first impression. You go to a WeWork opening "day of," they'd still be painting, there'd be ladders everywhere. People would be installing lights. The AC wouldn't be working. Because of the speed of everything, nothing was finished when it should have been. DON:And the major goal, from what I could tell, was just, how many offices could open and how much you could say the offices were filled and how many people were in them. It's almost like at car dealerships in craziness with getting the cars sold at the end of the month. You know, sales guy comes to me, it's the last day of the month, and, you know, "I really have to do this deal. It's 800 desks. It's gonna help us to get to the goal." And, you know, I look at the deal and it's like, you know, "First eight months free, and WeWork's building custom space." And the response was, you know, "Get 'em in. They love it, they'll grow." And, you know, I come to find out that the small company that can't afford to pay for the 800 seats for eight months is Microsoft. ALEX:They stopped being those savvy deal makers and the edge that they might have been bringing to negotiations is gone. Plus, of course, everyone talks, and so if everyone knows that SoftBank has given these guys a ton of money, are you really gonna let them cry "poor" or drive a really hard bargain? You're gonna say, "No," you know. "You guys have billions of dollars, you know, let us in." RANDALL:The ship of state, all the employees, all the tenants and the customers, all the partners, were leaning on Adam. Again, even Miguel, who's co-founder, slowly... was shunted aside. Adam wanted the spotlight. Then he wanted Rebekah to share the spotlight. ALEX:She became a bigger executive at WeWork. And it speaks to kind of her power with Adam and with the company that, over time, it's kind of like, "Oh, now there are three co-founders, there's Adam, Miguel, and Rebekah." JOANNA:Adam felt that she had pulled him out of whatever spiral that he was in. And he gave her a lot of credence for that, and he really felt like she was the backbone of their family. That doesn't mean she belongs in a corporate environment. - She had the sort of like New Age vibe and she starts guiding a huge amount of decisions at WeWork about the way they spent their money. Adam's and Rebekah's spiritual advisor would speak to executives on a weekly basis, and this constant dose of spiritualism was due to Rebekah. [cheering] ADAM: Hello, New York. Hello, WeWork. Hello, global citizens of this Earth. You know what a global citizen of this Earth is? It's a member of the We generation, and a member of the We generation does not discriminate with age, race, gender, or religion. If you're a member of the We generation, make some noise! [cheering] - WeWork is also expanding its kind of diverse and sometimes confusing portfolio. It makes a bunch of acquisitions of other startups. ADAM:We had this idea of, why don't we just invest money in companies that make impact? All the employees will wanna work for them, everybody wanna be part of it, and it's just gonna work out in an amazing way. And I looked at our team and everybody looked at each other. They said, "Of course, Adam, that makes a lot of sense, but who's gonna pay for that?" And we said, "Well... Masa might..." No. We said, "Well..." That was a private joke. - I went back to meet with Adam at sort of the new-and-improved headquarters. I get sort of the quick version of the tour and now WeWork has its own barista. So I say, "Okay, I want a cappuccino," and Adam orders a latte. And I reach for my coffee, and Adam's like, "Oh, no, no, that's mine." And I was like, "No... Hold on, you know. I got the cappuccino. Like that's a cappuccino." And Adam just looks really confused and upset. And one of the staff is like, "Oh, I'm sorry. We actually call those lattes and those cappuccinos here," pointing at the opposite one. It stood out to me as just like a strange, gratuitous reality-distortion moment around Adam because he was ordering lattes but wants cappuccinos. And rather than try to explain to him that he's wrong, they're just gonna change the meaning of that word. RANDALL:The money got insane. And they shifted from this little idea... Then it was, "Okay, we're now going to tell you how to live, WeLive. And now we're gonna redefine how you live." And that wasn't good enough. "WeGrow. We're gonna educate your kids better." - When my eldest daughter was in kindergarten, as we started to look around for schools in both New York and the west coast, I wasn't finding a place that was gonna nurture her spirit and her soul as much as her mind. DON:You know, at some point Rebekah was talking to the company about WeGrow, and she's talking in front of a cross-section of 700 employees, and is basically saying that, New York City private schools aren't good enough for our children. And then meanwhile, you're gonna start a school that has like a 35, 40 grand tuition fee per elementary school kid. That school is exclusionary to a lot of people, right? That's just a prototypical person who's grown up in certain circles and doesn't realize there's other people in the world. RANDALL:The idea that you're gonna reinvent work is incredibly audacious unto itself. To say, "While we're doing that, we're also gonna reinvent education..." which people have been trying to do for centuries, that's the kind of decision tree that you see in a company where you start to believe your own BS. HOST:All right, welcome, everyone, to The School of Greatness podcast. We've got Rebekah Neumann in the house. - Thanks for having me. - Yeah, this is fun. What is the mission of WeGrow, just so I understand clearly? - The mission of WeGrow, and quite honestly the collective "we" that we're all living under, is to elevate the world's consciousness. HOST: Hmm. - At WeGrow, specifically, through unleashing every human's superpowers and expanding happiness. - Okay, and it's... And WeGrow is starting as a school? - Yes. - But it's going to be evolving into much more, I'm assuming, right? - It's kind of a practice and a new approach to life. We have started with children, but we're... as soon as next week starting to pilot some of the curriculum on our WeGrownups. - Really? - Uh-huh. - Is that what you call us? - Just for the moment. - For fun, yeah. - Yeah, why not? AUGUST:I was working in WeWork and living in WeLive. My entire life... was being propped up by the We community. Every time a friend outside of the We community would come over, they would only come over that one time. Because they would walk out with this strange impression of what it is. And pretty quickly I had alienated most of my friends outside of the building. - When Adam had an investor coming through, we would know ahead of time or 10 minutes before, and we were being told, "Go into the space. Just hang out, be casual. Bring your laptop." And we would go there and activate the space. AUGUST:They were like, "Everybody should come," just so there's pockets of folks that are living the WeLive life so Adam can come and sort of show it off. ♪ "Juicy" by Notorious B.I.G. playing ♪ - ♪ I used to read Word Up!magazine... ♪ QUINTON:And they'd put on "Juicy" by Biggie Smalls, and they'd be playing a loop over and over again, waiting for that one moment when the investor came so that when they walked the space, we were there just to fill it up and make it look good. AUGUST:Adam showed up with this investor and with every drink, he had another vision of what WeWork could be, like the We community could be, what it was growing into. And... at a certain point, you're like, "Dude, just shut the fuck up, man. "Like, we are just having a good time. "Can we just... can we just hang out and have this drink and just talk about anything else?" It got really draining and really exhausting, to constantly... be a part of... this... thing. DEREK:The initial clients of WeWork thought that they were members. But they were actually a resource from which WeWork could extract a reputation and then they could sort of slingshot that reputation to get big corporations to think, "We need to ask WeWork "how to attract the best and brightest of this up-and-coming generation." MEGAN:I eventually, I was promoted to operations manager, and so I was getting a little more distant from Adam. His excitement isn't so close to me that I... am breathing it in and, like, intoxicated by it. And I'm able to start seeing more clearlythat he was manipulative. He had ways of using psychology to maneuver through people's flaws and to use that to his benefit. Adam was giving me a review. We were in one of the glass conference rooms. He was telling me I was doing a great job. And then another employee walked by who was very peppy and very pretty, and he said, "But you're not her." And he pointed out her and said, "You could be, but you don't have the confidence that she has." I went home and thought, "What do I need to do to become a better employee here and become like her?" You're constantly in this fear of, "somebody else is gonna take my job. I have to fight to stay here." Like, I felt constantly like I couldn't just breathe. Adam would state, "I could fire all of you and do this by myself." That's a bold statement to say to people who are working their ass off for you. - Good morning. -Shalom. -Shalom. Um... I'm sure that there are lots of people here who know what WeWork is, who maybe have worked in one or several WeWorks... DEREK:So I met Adam in Washington, D.C. for an event. My friends who worked at WeWork told me about him. And they just said this was one of the most charismatic... one of the most visionary and ingenious leaders of any tech company in the world. He just sounded like a mythical figure. And I was just really curious, like, what does he understand about leasing real estate and subdividing it? Like, we're talking about one of the most boring business models in the world, and I was really curious to know what was behind it. It's fascinating to me about WeWork because lots of people here who have been there, they've seen how lovely the interior decoration is. But there are lots of companies that make beautiful spaces. Um, but they're not worth $20 billion, which is WeWork's most recent valuation. So I wonder what do you consider to be your special sauce? - So, first of all, excellent question. From the first day that we started WeWork, it was about bringing people together. As our mission, and our mission always... - And his answer was everything that we've heard in the last few years, it's that they were doing something special with the culture, that their special sauce couldn't be found in earnings or cash flow or revenue. It was a... a spirit of We that was the truly distinguishing part of this company. - And the one thing, you say, "Are you a co-working space?" We're as much a co-working space as Amazon is a book-selling store. Anybody who thought that Amazon was there just to sell books just didn't understand the vision, and you just need to look now and see how much greater the vision is. DEREK:You know, I wish I'd pressed him harder on it. But I didn't because I had no idea what the company actually was. And I think in the case of Adam Neumann, there were a lot of people who were impressed by his live charisma, who privately harbored doubts about exactly how all of this worked. I was one of them, I suppose, you know? I didn't say in that interview, "I think that this company is just, you know, a lot of smoke and mirrors." I didn't, I didn't know for sure. I just privately harbored this doubt that said that this was all kind of a magic show. - So our first mission was, create the world where people make a life. That was for WeWork. WeLive is helping you live and not just exist. And now we have a WeOS, which is our operating system for physical spaces. And it's growing very fast and it's everything from your entry system when you enter the building, but then how do you book a conference room and how do you attend an event and who's signed in the building...? STEVE:Real estate usually is a very dependable, predictable business. It doesn't grow that much, but it's steady. You can kind of map out these returns. But WeWork was growing so fast that it was being valued by investors as an ultrafast growth, low-overhead technology company. LISA:They created this sort of Facebook-type platform for members where you could get people connected through technology. DON:WeWork has what's like its internal LinkedIn, I call it, right? It's called the WeWork Member Network. You know, you have your profile page. - Adam was often saying, "Oh, and people are posting job opportunities and connecting with each other on the platform." ALEX:They had acquired a bunch of interesting technologies and were stitching together what might have been by far the most comprehensive tool for how people work. ADAM: We use beacon technology but a lot of other aspects. We're using our video cameras to actually see where interactions are happening. And our entire process is built to make our members more successful. ALEX:The cynical read, of course, is, well, those intentions are all great, but what you still do is office space and you are a real estate company. But I think that, you know, when companies are private, it's hard for us to know what's happening behind the scenes. - My business is called Thinknum Alternative Data. And we index and crawl public information from the Web. Our bots just happened to add WeWork into our list of companies, and then our bots found something astonishing about WeWork. WeWork painted themselves as this company that was growing extremely fast, and once people joined they don't really leave. But using data on the public Web, we actually plotted the churn rate, which is how many people join and then leave. And we did see that the churn rate had increased and this was accelerating. The other trend we found was no one ever used their internal social network. When you call yourselves a technology company, and when you actually build a social network to help further paint that picture, if no one uses it, then you're not a technology company. [keying on keyboard] Our next instinct was, let's write a blog post and, you know, just share our findings. It really started taking off there. Then, about three hours later, WeWork sent us an email asking if we could take down the blog post. Our first instinct was to just ignore it. And then the community manager stopped by to our office. And she says, "You've violated our membership happiness clause," and the kicker was, she said, "You have 30 minutes to leave." [laughs] In the wake of our blog post and publication, WeWork kept raising more money. SCOTT:I first read about WeWork when they raised money on SoftBank, at a $20 billion valuation. And at that point they had about 200 locations. I went through and looked at the buildings that they actually had their facilities in. And I determined at that valuation that the 200 buildings were each worth less than that WeWork office was being valued at. And I said that WeWork was the most overvalued private company in the world. ALEX:Adam Neumann told us repeatedly that WeWork was profitable. We've since found out that how Neumann and WeWork were considering themselves profitable was a stretch at best. WOMAN:Are you profitable? ADAM:So we are... as per choice. Because when you have a 40% business, when you have a margin, you can actually choose when to be profitable. WOMAN: Right. - We like to hover around an EBITDA, a break even, and then we can choose when we wanna move, where we wanna move. Right now we're in a very high-growth stage of our business, and we don't see that stopping anytime soon. - So EBITDA-- earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization-- is sort of this accepted metric for how profitable a company might be. But WeWork started inventing their own financial metrics to enter into this consensual hallucination, and they used this term "community adjusted EBITDA." Basically it was an attempt to say, "we want to pretend to be profitable by ignoring these expenses." MAUREEN:They adjusted for things that were ridiculous to strip out and say you're profitable. So suddenly they went from a loss-making company to a profitable company, just by financial engineering and gimmickry. Every year WeWork would project profits, would fail to make any profits and actually their losses would get larger and larger. Yet investors in the private markets kept on bidding up the price of WeWork. It kept on getting higher and higher and higher. It's sort of mind-boggling that that happened. And I mean that more than anything else speaks to the gifts of Adam Neumann. - It is my honor and pleasure to introduce to you right now our co-founders, Miguel McKelvey and Adam Neumann. Help me welcome them to the stage! - Shalom! LIRON:I was proud to see the events continue to grow. But I saw the change in Adam. I think it was money blindness. There's so much money behind us that nothing can happen, right? We'd become untouchable, in a sense. [audience applauding] It started to feel like it was more just about the business and not about this communitythat I grew to love over those many years. I think that's where I started to lose my creative juices for the company. QUINTON:After my first summer camp, I tried to get out of entering the second year. I sat down with one of the executives and explained to her that, "Last year I went, I didn't enjoy myself. It's not for everybody, and please don't make me go again." And she kindly said, "I see your point, but it's a mandatory event, as most company outings are." - The "We" is, I think, the really big thing in the mission of what we're doing. So let's just close our eyes for one second. Close eyes, hold hands. DON:The way these events worked was that you would go hear presentations for like almost eight hours a day for maybe two or three days. And to make sure that people were actually attending... we had tracking bracelets on. REBEKAH: Just think about a reality in which the energy that we're feeling right now with one another is an energy of unity, an energy where I am you and you are me and we all are we. QUINTON:They would address the crowd, uh, talking about whatever word of the day that was... like "authenticity." And as we're sitting in the mud, I'm thinking, "Well, you forced me to come to this summer camp and sit in the mud. Nothing about this to me seems authentic." ADAM: If we do the work right and we find a way to become a real family in this community and company, we could wake up one day and say, "We want to solve the problem of children without parents in this world." We can win-- and do it. REBEKAH: And children who are in abusive situations. ADAM: And then children in abusive situations. And from that we can go to world hunger, and there's so many topics that we could take one by one, and we will be able to tackle anything that we set our minds to. MAUREEN:He would talk about being president of the world. He would say things like that and people would say, "Eh, is he serious?" It seemed really wild and crazy, but it was hard to make sense of what made sense in unicorn land. ADAM: I wanted to talk a little bit about the past and where we came from. We're not here by mistake. This was thought about and planned 10 years ago. And the funniest thing about it, from the day we moved to Brooklyn, Miguel and I were meeting regularly, just like that picture, planning for the future. We knew that... whatever it is we're looking for must be greater than ourselves. Moving forward the "We" company. ALEX:SoftBank had bet on Adam as an entrepreneur. They knew that the valuation was high. But they thought that, you know, a winner-take-all in this market, like they had seen in other markets, would be so big that they could, you know, tolerate that, that valuation. But when there's sort of a critical mass of doubt coming back to SoftBank, what are the sovereign wealth funds, who are the biggest investors in SoftBank's Vision Fund, what are they saying? RANDALL:When you're raising $100 billion, you're going to the biggest deep-pocket sources, so, of course, where does Masa go but he goes to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and they became his biggest backers. - The Saudis put dumb money into Masa Son's Vision Fund, because he says, "I'll get you in on the ground floor "of the next generation of great tech companies "that are gonna rule the world. Give me $45 billion, and I'll make you a trillion dollars." RANDALL:They wanna get out of the oil business and get into as many other businesses as possible. Because they're sitting on a dwindling asset. And so what better business to diversify than technology and what better way than with the most renowned tech investor in the world who wants to play on the scale that you can play on? - The problem, however, is that you can't really get in on the ground floor at Facebook or Google or Amazon or Netflix. It's way too late. So you have Masa Son investing all this money in companies he's telling the world are tech companies but aren't real tech companies. RANDALL:And that's a lot of pressure to put on a team, to say, "Pretty soon this company better be worth $100 billion," and at some point you have to have the numbers to back up that valuation. - You and me... RANDALL:And that meant that they had to show growth at any cost. And that's a problem. - Show them your heart, show them your truth. Never give up! [crowd cheering, whistling] Work until you drop! [waves crashing] ♪ Hawaiian band playing "Jingle Bells" ♪ MAUREEN:It's Christmas Eve 2018, Adam is with his family in Hawaii. Surfing, you know, relaxing. It's vacation time. Masa and Adam were working on a plan that they were calling internally Project Fortitude. And it was essentially a plan for SoftBank to spend about $20 billion and become a majority owner of WeWork. Because of SoftBank's money and a lot of what Masa pushed Adam to do, they were spending as if they were gonna have this deal done and bring so much capital to keep growing. There was this hole, this future hole coming, that they were gonna need a lot more capital to fill it. SCOTT:This was a company that was burning, at one point, $100 million a week. Think about this, you could buy two Bombardier Global Expresses at $50 million each, crash both into a mountain, and that was the burn every week of this company. MAUREEN:And so kind of everything was working towards this goal of this SoftBank partnership. - There's something called the Nantucket Sleigh Ride, which is, when you harpoon a whale, you're supposed to bring him to the ship,but occasionally a Nantucket Sleigh Ride is when the whale takes you out to sea and you're stuck. You gotta ride that whale outeven if that whale takes you to Greenland. Adam clearly thought he was taking Masa on a Nantucket Sleigh Ride, and that SoftBank had already committed so much money, they were already in, that they were kind of stuck. And so the way Adam was running the company, it was the assumption that he had an infinite supply of billions to keep growing. - Adam had been convinced earlier in the month that this was gonna happen and the people doing the deal were essentially done. It was pencils down on sort of December 24 at WeWork. Everyone expected it was gonna happen. [phone buzzing] MAUREEN:And then Adam gets a call from Masa on Christmas Eve, basically telling him, "Sorry, I can't go through with it. "The market's working against me. Investors don't like it. We just can't make it work right now." RANDALL:When Masa decides he's not gonna put that money in, Adam Neumann had a problem, because he had nowhere else to go. Nobody else is gonna write him a check because everyone knows SoftBank has the money. So if SoftBank's not putting in more money, there must be a problem. MAUREEN:Like it or not, they're going to need more money somehow. ♪ suspenseful music playing ♪ [surf and wind roaring] - It's really funny, I've been looking, I've been watching the press around this last fundraise and I actually think it's hilarious because for some reason there was an expectation that there was gonna be like a $20 billion or $16 billion raise. It's a $6 billion raise. It's the second largest venture capital investment of all time. I'm an investor in Uber so I know what the first largest one was. It's the second largest of all time. It's SoftBank coming into this company. Now they have $10 billion invested in this company. So the notion that anybody is projecting that they don't have confidence in the company I think is crazy. I have confidence in the company. - First of all, thank you, Ashton, it's amazing. ELIOT BROWN:After the collapse of the deal, they're out there trying to put this really good face on. He brings along Ashton Kutcher as this pump-up guy. And it was really disingenuous. - It's above and beyond what we need to fund the company for the next... HOST: Okay. - ...four to five years. ELIOT:Adam was saying things that were completely false. WeWork was currently a bonfire of cash and was gonna run out of money by the end of the year. - The interesting thing about the investment, there's a lot of rumors and there's what happened. The most important thing is, when Masa called me and said, "You know, this has happened and that happened and the world is changing," the first thing he said is, "I'm calling you to share this as a partner. And I just wanted to come up with a solution together." - Because that deal didn't happen, does that change your thoughts on an IPO timeline? - Just so we-- we keep saying "did not happen," just so we're clear. We never signed the deal. It's not that we signed the deal and something happened. We were trying to figure out the best way to do it. But, no, regarding an IPO, it's always been an option. We are ready for an IPO. - You are ready? - WeWork is always ready for an IPO. We will choose the right time to do it when it's correct for the mission of the company. - What are you looking for? - I want to elevate the world's consciousness. - Okay, so when you do that, then you can go public? - It's not one or the other. When I feel that to achieve that mission, going public will help it, that will be the day. INTERVIEWER: Were you anticipating WeWork's S1 when it came out? - No. I remember I was on vacation, it was in August, and I remember telling my family when someone sent me a link to it, and I started reading the first few pages, I said, "I apologize. I'm out for the weekend," because this was just too good and I needed to read through this. It felt more like a, uh... a novel written by someone who was shrooming than an S1. RANDALL:An S1 is a form you have to fill out that's a precursor to going public. It's a first introduction to your company, to the world, where you're representing that these are the facts. But that means you've gotta come clean, and there are a lot of details in there, and in WeWork's case, the devil was in the details. - So the first red flag was on page one. It says, "We dedicate this to the energy of We -- greater than any one of us but inside each of us." I mean, for God sakes, they're renting fucking desks. ELIOT:I was actually on vacation in the middle of Austria, hiking with some friends, and then I get to a place where there's a little service. [bird chirps, phone chimes] I just start getting these texts and emails, and it's like "WTF." And like, "Oh, my God!" And I was like, "I think I know what happened." MAUREEN:Almost everyone you talked to had a different item that horrified them. [laughs] So like one by one, they would say, "I cannot believe his wife is choosing his successor," or, "So egregious that he would have these 20-1 voting shares." Or, "I can't believe the company is paying him $6 million for the trademark to the word 'we' in the company name." DEREK:He was buying buildings, and then asking WeWork to lease those buildings from him. And then he took $700 million out of this company at the very time he was asking the publicto put money in the company. - With many of these unicorn IPOs, the CO is mentioned anywhere between 12 and 40 times. In the case of Adam Neumann, it was 170 times. [computer key clicking] If you tell a 30-something male that he's Jesus Christ, he's inclined to believe you. ELIOT:Rebekah is very involved in the part of the document that people laughed at, and they were spending a lot of time in the Hamptons. And they had this sort of constant stringof WeWork employees who would get a seaplane or helicopter to go out to the Hamptons just to meet with them on some IPO stuff. You just keep reading it and be like, "Oh, my God, did anyone pr-- like, look at this and tell them what it was gonna look like?" The reality is that, like, people had been telling Adam that for a while but he didn't care; he thought that people would look past it or he wanted to enrich himself and thought that it wouldn't be a big deal. Meanwhile, he was around WeWork less. He went on a month-long birthday celebration where he went to the Maldives to surf. You know, I think generally he was seen as more erratic and nervous and... in hindsight, he probably had a view that maybe this has gone too far. Him going surfing was a way of avoiding reality... and keeping the high life going as much as he could. COMMENTATOR 1:This company has just been savaged after its S1 came out. COMMENTATOR 2:The price has come down and down and down. COMMENTATOR 3:$47 billion dropped down to 10 to 15. COMMENTATOR 4:Every day now they're trying to come up with something to salvage this IPO, and I don't know if they're gonna do it. - We'll clean it up. I think we're great, and I think we're preparing for the roadshow right now. Just hope my hair is good. WOMAN: Your hair looks great. - Okay. This is harder than 20-foot waves. MAN: [laughing] I get it. - You know why? 'Cause I control the 20-foot waves. [laughter, woman responding indistinctly] I'll take a 20-foot wave... every day for the next 10 days. MAN: I'm scared of drowning just thinking about it. - All right. Real estate is going through a fundamental shift. From a "fixed cost per seat" commodity... MAUREEN:The world was kind of up in arms about how egregious this company was. But Adam had to go public anyway. - ...have a 12-year headstart. - There's a two-week period you start marketing your shares officially to investors. It's called a roadshow. Kind of like a central part of the roadshow is a video that goes along with it. So, they had filmed portions of it already. So theoretically he was just gonna do his part of it, they can edit it in. - Fixed cost commodity, fixed cost commodity. Fixed cost commodity... ELIOT:Adam kept delaying, and even literally would leave rooms full of people waiting, set up for him to come. They spent hundreds of thousand dollars on shoots that Adam didn't go to. WOMAN: That one sounded great. - Thank you. MAUREEN:It seems kind of, like, it's procrastination, but, you know, was there something deeper, I don't know, of why you don't show up to film this thing? Finally they start filming him, but that day he was just off. - Just a second. Zack, you need the sentences to be full for me. So whenever you have a dead space like this, put that up there. - In general, he's an incredible speaker if you see him, but he can't really read off a teleprompter. He struggles with that. - Yeah, the reason it's a little hard for me is, I'm not a guy who reads from a script, that's the thing. To do it totally free, though, I need to, I can't... I'm doing word-for-word so I'm gonna need to loosen it up a little bit. MAUREEN:And I think as the day wore on, it just went on and on and on and on. And he seemed more frazzled and wasn't getting through it and wasn't making sense. - Based on our savor... Agh! Ugh! Let's go. MAUREEN:It became somewhat like a party. It just almost like devolved the whole night. - The employees of all companies all need the same thing. Wellness, food. MAUREEN:He just didn't do a good job by everyone there. And I think a lot of people who were there were quite stressed. They're like, "This has to get done. We're supposed to do this tomorrow." It's almost like, this is your worst nightmare. - This is who I am. This is what I do. I tackle something until it's right. I will not stop. This is what no one's understanding right now, but it's okay because we'll make sure they learn. ELIOT:And then the next morning, they decide... "No, it's just not gonna happen. We need to call it off." MAUREEN:Adam came in to WeWork's office. He comes in, he's more dressed up than usual. And gives an all-hands talk. And there he basically told all the staff, "This doesn't mean the IPO's off. "Like, we're gonna come back and this is gonna be amazing and, um, we will do an IPO later this year." But like everything behind the scenes was beginning to happen to start to oust him. ELIOT:At the time, it was less known that Adam was this totally erratic CEO that had sort of messianic statements and was doing things in a way that a lot of people would call crazy. Uh, and so we basically laid that out in a story. The signature anecdote to the thing that probably got the most attention was about how he took a plane trip with friends to Israel, and they were smoking pot on the plane, and then in Israel they didn't finish all the pot and so they stuffed some in a cereal box. The crew on the plane finds it and is sort of incensed. And so they recall the plane. Uh, and so then Adam has to find his own way back from Israel. SCOTT:When you can land two rockets concurrently on barges and you smoke pot, you're seen as quirky and likable. When you don't go public and your investors lose money, all of a sudden they decide that smoking pot is a criminal activity. MAUREEN:Once Eliot's article came out, he became pretty much untouchable on Wall Street. And so, he made the decision to step down at, like, the urging of a lot of different people. - Adam Neumann is expected to step down as... NEWS ANCHOR:The company went from a $47 billion valuation to near bankruptcy in just six weeks. - The future of the company very uncertain at this point. AUGUST:When I first heard about WeWork's financial collapse, I honestly did feel really, really sad for Adam. Because it felt like he believed in what he was doing with every fiber of his being. NEWS ANCHOR:WeWork now is suddenly in decline, the office-sharing company's new financial lifeline giving its controversial co-founder Adam Neumann a $1.7 billion payout to step down while the troubled company's reportedly planning massive layoffs. AUGUST:When I started to learn a little bit more about it, um... that sadness turned to anger pretty quickly. Because... now all of a sudden, it felt like this person lied to me, lied to a bunch of people, about this beautiful way of working and this beautiful way of living. I felt angry at him for doing that, but also felt angry at me for, like, buying the bullshit. And when they started laying people off, the anger switched to rage. DON:It seemed like WeThis, WeGrow, WeLive, WeWork. We-we-we-we-we. You know, it's gotta be we, not me. It was we for everybody, except for Adam. MAUREEN:He got a golden parachute worth $1.7 billion. The idea that there would be all this money given to Adam was demoralizing. DON: You know, that kind of sticks in your craw a little bit, particularly when you've been preached at about, "It's all about we." If that's your deal and you're sitting on all this money and you really believe in what you were saying the whole time, you should give some of the money back to help the employees who got screwed. MARGARITA:I think what's frustrating about all of that is that, when you focus the story on Adam, you miss how many people worked really, really hard to bring this impossible vision to life, who got nothing. They cared about WeWork a lot. They were invested in its success. They were invested in the community. And they were hurt financially. Reputationally. Suddenly this company that they spent years on is a laughingstock. - My mind was warped in such a way at WeWork that I felt, when I left, I had to unwarp it. They don't care about you. You know, like that really, really messed with me, because I thought, "Who is telling me the truth?" I have done a lot of therapy to like navigate through what happened there. Why was I so devastated when it ended? Why did it feel like, not that I lost a job, but like I lost my purpose? Some mind trick has been played on a lot of us. You know, it just... [crying]...I think of myself as this... younger girl, and I wanna say to her, "You didn't do anything wrong." Like, "You're valuable and that company is not your worth." But because I felt like, how am I gonna change the world now? Like, I needed that. AUGUST:When I look back on my time spent in the We community... I see all the friends that I made. Um, all the relationships that I still have. All the people that I deeply care about. The people that I wouldn't have met outside of the We community. Those are the people that I choose to remember. Not... the asshole that wrecked it. ALEX:You know, people will see in Adam Neumann what they wanna see. That may not be the most fulfilling answer for a lot of people, but I do think that he can represent a lot more than what he really is. And I think that, you know, the reason that maybe he resonates with people is because it felt like he was close. Clearly there was something about WeWork and something about Adam where maybe he could have pulled it off. It could have come together into something beautiful. But unfortunately he set an example which maybe is harmful for other entrepreneurs to follow, or he's embodied the American dream in a way that worries us because it was so attractive and it was so intoxicating and yet had this disastrous result, that that bothers us more than if he had just been a failure with WeWork. MEGAN:There's a lot of really special elements about WeWork that... I hope continue to last. Like especially as we sit in this time of COVID and we're, you know, people are working from home, and, you know, I, myself, have been inside, mostly inside for, you know, months and months. And it is on the days that I get to interact with other people that I come home and I'm like, "Wow, that was a fulfilling day." Community, I think, has been... taken piece by piece from our world for quite a while, like very slowly, and then now here we are sitting literally in... in a pandemic of lack of interaction and I would give anything to like... be consumed with people again. The vision of us working together, to be better together, is lacking today. I think we need that. We go back in time to the Greek town squares. It has existed forever. Community has existed forever. Because it's crucial to our survival as human beings. What are we if we don't have each other? ♪ [crowd noises in distance] ♪ string orchestra playing contemplative classical music ♪
