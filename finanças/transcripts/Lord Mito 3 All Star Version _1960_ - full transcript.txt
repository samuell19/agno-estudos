THEN AT DAWN ON MAY 3RD, A FIRE BROKE OUT IN KOMAGOME, BURNING DOWN THE TWO GATES OF ASAKUSA AND SUJIKAI, AND CONTINUING ON INTO THE NIGHT. BE CAREFUL WITH FIRES. MAY 10. THE ELDERS SAND OFFICIALS HEARD THATTHE FREQUENT FIRES THATS BEEN OCCURRING MAY BE THAT OF ARSON. MEN, INSTRUCTYOUR SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS TO HUNTTHEM DOWN. As ifto mock the Cabinet's earnest efforts... THEN ON JUNE 2ND, IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT A FIRE BREAKS OUT IN HIRAKAWA-CHO, OUTSIDE OF HANZO GATE. NISHINOMARU CATCHES ON FIRE AND BURNS DOWN COMPLETELY. The wildrumors had led Edo into the crossroads offire. It brought anxiety to both the commoners and samurai. The remnants of the Marubashi Chuya gang had made another rally to raise public disturbance. Just around the same time, there was a big fire in Kyoto. And that created greater anxiety for the people. But they manage to recover from the burnt grounds, and... It's the Sensei! Is anyone in dismal? I'll treat today. Thanks. I've been unlucky in gambling. So I could only afford a bottle of sake tonight. Don't give me that. He was born in a family of master spearsmen, but he's doing humble work now. My heart goes out to him. Why should he spend his money on you? Don't feel so sorry for me. As much as I feel badly towards the fire victims, my ordinary construction pay has jumped up from 300 mon to 410 mon. I can treat him to a bottle or two of sake. They say you don't need a weapon to kill a carpenter. Ten days of rain will do it. What if it rains a couple of days? Then I'll find a job clearing the ditches. Sensei, this is from my boss in appreciation for the other day. Look, this is a reward for clearing a ditch. Here, have a drink. Thanks. I'll give you my bottle. Then I'll give you mine. And I'll give you mine. I feel like I'm imposing on everyone here. I ended up with one bottle. Something doesn't add up. I would sure like to see the Sensei become rich. Then the country will prosper. I don't want to become rich. Rich men live by obligations, displays and associations. Being able to drink with all of you like this is my joy in life. So don't leave me out, okay? There are a few new people here today. I should go and become friends with them. Pleased to meet you. I'm Edo Zunzaemon. Edo? That's right. "Edo" as in "drawing water". The "zun" in "Zunzaemon" means the eldest of six. Oh, your name is Ido Jinzaemon. Yes, Edo Zunzaemon. I'm Ume'mon, a retiree from Mito. The "ume" as in "umeboshi" (pickled plum). Is that why you have wrinkles on yourface? They are Sukezo and Kakusuke, sons of the boatmen I employ. Pleased to meet you. Are you here on business? I heard there's been a lot of fires in Edo recently, so I got worried about my relatives. Were your relatives safe? Their house burned down in the last fire. Was the family safe, though? I went to visit them as soon as I arrived this morning, but they weren't there and I didn't know where they moved to. That's not good. Tell me where they lived. I'll go there immediately and... There's nothing we can do at this hour already. I'll send my two men out tomorrow. Are you sure? If you came out today and your relatives' home was burnt down, then you must have no place to go now. I'll just find an inn to stay at. What are you saying? With the lack of homes, all the inns in town are fully booked. Stay at my place tonight. I live in the back tenements. We can all squeeze and sleep. No, we can't impose on you. Just leave it to me. Let's stay at his place. Let me showyou the way. Sensei! Does that mean we can't hearyou sing tonight? That's what I came here for. If I don't hearyou sing, I won't be able to sleep well tonight. Please give me a break tonight. They're tired, so I want to let them rest right away. Please don't worry about us. In that case, I will sing for them. Just what we were waiting for! Please watch your footsteps. There are boards all over the place to cover the ditches. This place should've burned down instead of the others. Then the condition would be better when it's rebuilt. The landlord got the gall to charge us rent for this. Well, sorry about that. Why, hello Landlord. That man there has got more gall than me. He hasn't paid his rent for a year now. Landlord, I have guests today. My home is lighted. Is someone here? I just assumed that you were home unusually early. Please wait here a bit. Sir Jinzaemon! Who are you!? You killed my brother! What are you doing? Stop! Please calm down. I wouldn't do a foolish thing as to kill your brother. My brother kept saying lately... ...that he has to meet with you to hearyourfinal intent. And depending on your answer, he might have to kill you. When I came home from a short errand, he wasn't home. So I rushed over, thinking he might've come here. And things turned out, just as I feared. I'm not a man of many intents. Are you going to play games with me? There are police officers coming this way. Clear the way! Who killed him? He did! As proof, there's blood on his sword! Sir Jinzaemon, do you still deny it? Miss, will you take a good look at the blood on his sword? The blood is only on the point of the sword. So the injury inflicted would've been minor. It wouldn't be an injury deep enough to kill a man. You're right. You're smart. He lives up to his name. I slashed the intruder that was running out the back. But I had no intent of killing him. Did you recognize that intruder? No. Stop interfering. We'll question him at the station. I haven't seen you around in this neighborhood before. I've told everyone that I'm a retiree from Mito. But after what's happened... It might be best to reveal my true identity. Oh, my! He's the infamous Old Lord of Mito! He travels incognito to check on the people. Everyone, on your knees! You guessed wrong on that. I'm not as important as the Old Lord of Mito. I'm a police officerfrom Mito. They are my subordinates. We had a big fire in Mito last month, and it was concluded to be arson. We have a lead on the arsonist, so we came to Edo to find him. The Mito clan councillorfiled a report with the overseer. So we have his letter of permission on hand. You scatterbrain! Take him away! You have no proof that the Sensei did it! That's right! Shut up! Stop complaining before I have you arrested, too! In Mito, we don't arrest a man without solid proof. But in this case, you should go with them quietly. You'll probably be released tomorrow morning. So the country officer is talking big now. From my guess, he won't be coming out again. He'll be going far away. The beddings are in the closet. I'm sure the three of you can fit. Have a good rest. Thank you. Will he really be all right? Do you have a plan? Wow, now. Earlier, Jinzaemon said he hurt the intruder running out the back. There may be bloodstains left on the ground. Let's check. That old man is a real police officer. He must be a very sharp one, too. He takes wise steps. Blood. Who lives here? Takigawa Gunpei, a ronin. He moved in two days ago. He has ronin friends visiting all the time. He has drinking parties and is living it up. What's all the commotion? Excuse me. There was a killing in the tenements. So I've heard. What's this blood on the ground? An old friend came to visit me, so I killed a gamecock and made pot stewwith it. The blood is from that gamecock I killed. Now that you've got your answer, will you leave? You disrupted my sleep. MITO CLAN'S UPPER MANSION What? My father is a police officerfor Mito castletown, and you and Kakunoshin are his subordinates? If the series of fires are being committed by the Iawless ronin, then it is a serious matter. That is why he is here to personally investigate it. He would like you to secretly report that to the city magistrate, Nose Izumo. I'll have Bizen notify the city magistrate right away. When in hunger, one will fight desperately. I've asked the Shogun to ban the prohibition on hiring ronin. But for some reason, he hasn't listened to me yet. It may be in hesitation of the Ooku's view towards the Mito, but his close vassals don't seem to want to make any moves. I can't let all the burden fall on my elderly father, though. At the stake of my post as Vice Shogun... Or at the stake of my life... Clear the way! You, deceitful geezer! What do you think you are doing!? Don't play dumb with me! I heard you got the Sensei arrested! I'll punch you out and stretch out your wrinkles! Please wait! He's a police officerfrom Mito. He claims the Sensei will be released tomorrow morning. What do you know, you country officer! In Edo, they investigate the ronin and treat them harshly. They won't easily release a ronin under custody. How foolish can you be! Sensei may be a ronin, but he's not your ordinary one! He's such a good-natured fool, with no evil bones. Isn't that right? Did you hear that? But you damn geezer had to... He has no idea howworried we are about him! Knowing him, he's probably making friends in jail. He must be cheering up all the men in jail. Hey! I don't know how it is in the far country of Mito, but... in Edo, the morning ends with the nine bells of Senso-ji Temple. If the Sensei doesn't come back by then, then I'll smash my fire hook into that wrinkled head of yours and let the goldfishes swim in the hole! Do you get that, geezer!? The nine bells are starting to ring. What are you going to do? They're back! The Sensei is back! I'm so glad that they released you! Thank you for the greeting. Please come in. Where's the Sensei? He said he'll come after he makes a stopover. He had a stopover to make? So he was released? Yes, with that ronin. The Sensei instructed me to give you something nutritious to eat, since you're in a weak condition. I have no eels here, so please have some loaches. I'm Ohara Yasunosuke. I appreciate your kindness. Everyone, please excuse me. I can't take this anymore! I didn't sleep a wink last night, worrying about him! I was prepared to storm into the magistrate's office if he wasn't released this morning! Isn't that right? Say something, will you! This is the end of the straw! I'll always have to worry, if I stick with him. I won't talk to him anymore. Hi, there. So you're all here. Sensei, I'm glad you're out. Thanks for everything. What are you saying? We're closer than that. I was so worried about you. I'm glad that you're all right. Aren't we glad, everyone? Fool! You're truly troublesome! This is it between us! Don't loiter around my place to make friend with me! The front of my house is a public road, free to all. So you can pass in front of it, if you want. How dense can you be! You didn't have to yell at him like that. Shut up! No one can straighten out my warped mind now. But I don't want him to be carried to my house when he dies because he's my childhood friend. Take this to pay for his food expenses. Thank you for everything. I'm sure there'll be a time when I can repay you. Please excuse me now. You seem very tired. Shall I have the palanquin bearers take you home? No, I live closeby. I'll enjoy the river breeze as I walk home. Till we meet again. He's a refined ronin. There was a police raid near Eko-in last night, and he was caught in the middle of it. He was coughing a lot. So I rubbed his back throughout the night. Where did you have to go before you came here? Oh, that's right! I wanted to let her know that I didn't kill her brother. So you went to see Itoji? How did the talk with her go? She wasn't even there. Her neighbors said she moved out. A palanquin had come for her this morning. Did some ronin come for her? Two men that looked like clerks came for her. I don't knowwhat's going on here. From what I know, her brother had no merchant friends. SUKA-GAWA RIVER UZURA BRIDGE Welcome back. My masterwas worried about you. Please come inside. Sir Ohara is back. I'm back. Lord Yanagisawa Mino's steward informed us that you'll be released today. So I was relieved to hear that. But you still had to spend a night in jail. It turned out to be a very interesting night. She'll be taking care of you during your stay here. She used to serve Sir Kato in Kumamoto before. Her name is Itoji. Please be good to me. I made the arrangements for tonight. Won't we arouse suspicions by having such a big meeting? You needn't worry about that. It's supposed to be a musical gathering. The people of Edo are into singing these days. Even the Shogun, himself, dances the Noh. The Noh dancing will be over shortly. He shall be on his way over. Lords Kameido Okino Korechika and Matsudaira Harima Yoriaki have been chosen as hosts for the Imperial envoys. Make certain that there are no errors. Lord Kameido has a stipend of 43,000 koku. I heard he is a wealthy lord. Whereas Harima has only a stipend of 20,000 koku. Depending on what he gives... I heard Lady Keishoin has secretly told you about it. Does she dislike the Mito that greatly? "Hate a priest, and you will hate his very surplice". SirYoriaki. I heard you were chosen as the Imperial host. It is an honor to my clan. You'll be needing a lot of money for it. Send someone to Koishikawa before it gets out of hand. I'll let Nakayama Bizen know. Sir Chuzo! Sir Chuzo, please take a look. Don't the flowers look beautiful in the garden? Is your father continuing his travels across the country? Yes. I heard he's entered Edo recently. I didn't go to see His Excellency today. I stayed back here alone, thinking of the Old Lord of Mito. There have been many big fires in the city of Edo. And the people are feeling anxiety because of it. Should we be indulging in such entertainment? I'm not trying to criticize His Excellency for it, but he can't rule the country with his "sarugaku" dancing. Your responsibility as Vice Shogun is great. I've heard about the Ooku's hostility towards the Mito. But don't let that hold you back. Just remember that you have my full support. Uncle! I think Shinjuro was killed by someone he knew. But we need his younger sister, Itoji, to help us in investigating on his friends and associates. Having her disappear like that means... I'm sure we will eventually find her. Eventually? How nonchalant! Constable Morishita claims Jinzaemon is the killer. But my boss promised to arrest the real killer in a few days. That is how he got you released. And if he doesn't arrest the real killer? He'll have to turn in his truncheon and resign. We finally found the palanquin bearers that picked up Itoji. Did you find out where she went? She went to a restaurant in Fukagawa. Fukagawa? Itoji has no acquaintances in that area. Things are starting to come together. What? Let's ask that spirited young fellow for his help. Hey! Don't sprinkle so much water! You don't want to wet the people passing by! But not a single person is passing by. No one? Look again. Isn't there a dirty-looking... It's sure hot here. Just sprinkle it gently. He's irate because the Sensei isn't coming by. What was that? I'm in a bad mood because of him? I'm the one who severed the ties with him! He's caused me so much worries and frustrations! Besides, he...! I understand. So, stop yelling about him. It's getting heated here. That's not my fault. This is my house. So, I can say whatever I want! A freeloader like you should just keep quiet. Pumpkin! Well, excuse me for being a freeloader and pumpkin! You call me a freeloader, but whose fault is that? You're a lousy fireman, so my house burned down. Besides, this freeloading pumpkin takes care of the men in this house as well as the visitors. Besides, you only eat what I cook. The Sensei likes my cooking, too. It's sure hot. He didn't even look this way. Hey! Maybe I'll have some "shochu" (low grade sake). I'll have it with Omitsu's "kinpira gobo" (burdocks). That should go well together. But it's no fun to drink alone. Isn't there anyone to drink with me? Boss! I will! Fool! Is there anyone around to keep me company? It could be someone that I'm having a discord with. Omitsu, bring the "shochu". I don't know if I have "kinpira gobo". Stupid. Just take out anything. Boss, can I join you? Sure. Come on in. Thanks! Boss, we'll be coming in. What? The winds have been coming from the east lately. So the arsonists would target the areas from Ryogoku Bridge to Mitsumata, or the Ryotoku area. I want your squad to guard the Yakenbori district. Please increase the patrol for the next few days. If you see anyone by a fire, other than a fireman, please tail them, too. Suke-san! What is it, Kaku-san? Shall we have a drink for starters? What are you saying? We have an important job of staking out the place. What if Itoji shows up while we're having a drink? That's just it. I sure hope she shows up. Before that happens, a customer might show up and ask us to dash him over to the Yoshiwara. If he offers to tip us well, what are you going to do? It'll be better to keep watch from that bar. You're right. No, I'm not going for that. I'll go alone then. So if a customer shows up, you'll have a reason to decline. Kaku-san! Delicious. I'll have another. The Elder allows us to drink every so often, but... It gets stifling with him around. It's nice to have a leisure drink like this sometimes. Thanks. They're running away without paying! That's not it! How are we going to explain this to the Elder? If you had waited out there... Don't give me that. Let's go after the palanquin. Here, take your money. Palanquin bearers! Give me a ride. But, Sir... I'll tip you well, so follow that palanquin that just left. Yes, Sir. Partner, let's get going. Hurry! You'll lose sight of the palanquin ahead. Are you new to the business? This is ourfirst day. Oh, no. Turn left at the alley ahead. But the palanquin ahead went straight. I knowwhere they're headed. We're taking a shortcut. Sorry about that. Let's get going! It's gotten a lot easier! We're doing good! You're right. We've gotten the hang of it. Hey! Turn right there! I'll tip you well, so wait here. I don't see Itoji's palanquin. We don't see that palanquin we were following. They're gone already. Let me pay you now. Thank you. Here's yourfee! What's going on here? Why do you want to kill us? I saw you cops at Jihei Tenements. Judging by the fact that you dodged my sword... You can't be mere cops. I can't praise you for drinking on the job, but you didn't completely fail in the assignment. At least we know she went to see the group of ronin. Councillor Okabe is here for Lord Harima. I'll see him. Show him in. Your kind words at the castle had touched his heart. Oh, Kyuma! It's been a while. Thank you foryour kind words to my lord, Yoriaki. Feel free to discuss that with Bizen here. Be sure to assist Yoriaki with his important task as host. Thank you very much. It's my fault that they should take it out on Yoriaki, too. Please give Yoriaki my apologies for it. What are you saying? As the Vice Shogun... You've given just advice. But the Ooku find that displeasing, and cause trouble in every way they can. My lord understands the position you're in. So Yoriaki understands... Kyuma is a strong drinker. Have a good talk with him over some drinks. I'm going to the back now. The Vice Shogun rules wisely even in the second generation. This is truly auspicious. I'll have a drink, too. What's the matter? What's wrong? Please forgive me for not being able to help. What are you saying? I don't understand the politics involved with your job. But I know I should console you when you come here. Yet I can't do anything to help. I appreciate yourfeelings. But the job as Vice Shogun is beyond my capabilities. It makes it harder because my father is extraordinary. I know I can never be as great as my father, so... I just want to avoid doing anything to tarnish his name. That is why I am trying my utmost best. I don't like that geezer named Ume'mon. He's no ordinary rat. He's suspicious. The Sensei ignores me and sticks to him like glue. I don't like it at all. You sound like a jealous man who lost his lover. You fool. Go and inform the geezer. Arsonists! We've caught you in the act! Trouble! The arsonists appeared as you said! Let's go! Hurry! Don't let them escape! Just go after them! Boss! I'll take care of them! So you put out the fire! Men, follow me! Jinzaemon, don't kill them! We must capture them alive to get information! Okay. They went that way! He was at my home when Shinjuro was killed. He's the one I injured. They're escaping from the back gate! After them! Excuse me! How disrespectful of you, police cops. This is a very prominent temple. You need a permit from the Temple Magistrate to come in. This is the permit from the Temple Magistrate. What are you here to investigate? An arsonist fled into this temple earlier. Someone staying at this temple just returned. But he was referred to us by Kanei-ji Temple. Please let us see him. These men would like to see you. Please let them in. I am sorry to botheryou at this time of night. You are the men that were at the eatery with Ido Jinzaemon. Please come in. I believe you work for the police. It's a small temple so I overheard the conversation outside. So you cornered a suspicious man into this place. It's just a rat. I just set rat poison. It should become quiet soon. I heard there's been an increase in rats lately. There's about 200,000 of them throughout the country. Rats tend to nest where the foods are. So you can't blame them for naturally gathering in Edo. It's become quiet now. The rat poison must be working. Rats are living beings, too, so they seek food. But we can't let them alone if they burn down the house. I'm sorry to bother you. We'll leave the rat's corpse to the priest of this temple. Please excuse us now. Thank you for saving me. Incompetent one! Have you no courage to die like a samurai? Until we overthrow the Shogunate and restore Imperial rule, I won't... Enough talk, worm! You're using the Emperor to bring disorder to society and achieve personal advancement! Did you think I was unaware of your real motives? There may be some fighting for a while. Come out when all is calm. Don't throw stones to help us. We don't want to be mistakenly hit by them. We heard that a geezer officer named Ume'mon is pestering our comrades, so we came to get rid of him. But what a surprise it turned out to be. Let me first expose your two subordinate cops. Sasaki Sukesaburo! Atsumi Kakunoshin! That should tell me who the center gentleman is. The perfect man to kill. You investigate on us, but won't give your own name. The rats these days have become truly despicable. Shut up! I am Shogen, the son of Kagaya Hanbei, who had regretfully failed to overthrow the tyrannical Shogunate. If we kill Mito Mitsukuni, we can make a comeback. Fight hard! Old Lord! We are here to assist, per our Lord's order! Please leave them to us! Men, withdraw! Reporting! The Imperial envoys will be arriving at 5:30. Depending on what His Excellency decides... This may become our eternal parting. You've only been with me for three months. But thanks to you, I don't feel like my life was empty. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you. I feel like I've become a true wife to you now. When I receive word from the castle, I will act accordingly. I've heard stories about Hosokawa Garcia. I pray that you successfully carry out your duties. Lord. It is time for you to report to the castle. You are like a lotus flower. Thank you. The envoys will be departing Shinagawa at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. If we attack them and get them on our side, we can overturn the situation to our favor. We'll then set fire to various places in Edo. Your lotus has an extremely great reputation in Kyoto. Being that I am here in the season for it, I would like to see it by all means. Is it possible? That's an easy request. There are two things I would like your approval on. One, I would like you to give 10,000 koku to the Imperial Court for sending the envoys in concern of the burning of the Nishinomaru wing. What? 10,000 koku? After all, you are a vassal of the Imperial Court. And you have a fief of eight million koku. Whereas the Imperial Court only has 20,000 koku. To add to it, their fief is not a wealthy one. This huge gap between the Tokugawa and Imperial Court is the cause of the public disorder. The result of abolishing many daimyo clans have caused over 200,000 samurai to become unemployed. The prohibitory decree has denied the masterless samurai of attaining new employment with another clan. So they end up using the restoration of Imperial rule as an excuse to plot another riot like the Keian Incident. Do you think the fires are caused by the ronin, too? We must put an end to the disorders. Which leads to my second request of allowing the ronin to have gainful employment. Your requests cannot be granted. One moment, please! He may be young, but he is the country's Vice Shogun. He is trying his best to aid you in your administration. Even I can see that from the outside. I heard he requested to see you on this very day that the Imperial envoys are departing. So I figured he must be here with firm resolution. That is why I have come, too. If you won't grant his requests, then... He'll probably slit his belly. But I, Mitsusada, will dissuade you on that. I would advise you to rush back to Mito immediately, and hold up in your castle. And I will followyour lead and hold up in my castle. I am an uncle to both you and His Excellency. However, in order to amend the country's administration... It is not uncommon to go against one's blood relations. Elder, how is your rat hunt coming along? I haven't been able to find the rat's nest yet. There may be someone supporting the rats. Who benefits from the riots that the rats create? If they attack the straw bags, it'll be the straw bag maker. If they attack the cupboards, it'll be the cupboard maker. If they knock down the candlestick and burn the place... It'll be starting soon. What's the matter? Ume'mon and his men didn't come back last night. They might've left me in disgust. What!? Is that what you are crying about? I don't like this at all! Stop crying because that pickled plum guy is gone. Aren't you a man?! But, Boss... Will you give me a break? Don't say anything more. He must have a good reason for crying like that. Sensei, will you tell me the reason for it? Well, the truth is... I've betrayed Ume'mon. I lied to him! I knowwho killed Shinjuro and why he was killed. After the Tokugawa took rule... The "tozama" (non-hereditary) daimyo clans were abolished one after another. Then they passed the prohibitory decree that the ronin could not be employed by other clans. So now there are about 200,000 of those ronin nationwide. The distressed ronin, in cabal, caused the Yui Shosetsu Disturbance in 1651. And lately, there's been sign of another rally. Shinjuro must've been asked to join it. Because Shinjuro asked me. I refused, because I didn't want to serve anyone. He must've been killed because of it. The ronin who killed Shinjuro and was injured by me, was killed by Takigawa Gunpei at his house. Then Gunpei disappeared. I should've let Ume'mon know about it sooner. But I couldn't rat on the poor ronin. Ume'mon must've figured it out and thought I was unworthy as a friend. That is why he left me in disgust. A man-to-man friendship must be based on trust. That's what I live for... For the sake of the country's administration... He asked His Excellency to give the Imperial Court 10,000 koku. He also asked him to open the employment for the ronin. He staked his life and confronted His Excellency with them. And His Excellency approved them. Well, that's because... You have a fine successor. Is that true? He is very capable as the country's Vice Shogun. I, Mitsusada, am envious of you. Mitsusada... please forgive me for getting emotional. I, Mitsukuni, am happy. I am shedding tears of joy, too. Welcome! A bottle for me! Sensei, what's wrong? You must be depressed today without any work to do. Don't worry. I was lucky in gambling today. My wallet is smiling. I'll treat you to five or six bottles of sake. I am touched by your usual kindness. On the other hand, I am... Does he cry nowwhen he's drunk? So you're all here. Ume'mon! I... I thought you had left me in disgust. What are you saying? Why would I do that? Didn't you go to Yoshiwara pleasure quarters last night? So you were there until now. You sure have a lot of energy. What are you saying? Think of how the Sensei feels. Don't joke around like that. I'm sorry to worry you all. I had business to take care of at my home in Mito. I see. Is that right? Please have a seat. Excuse me! Is there a man named Ido Jinzaemon here? Yes, he's here. I was asked to deliver this to him. "Please forgive me forwriting to you like this, after receiving such kindness from you. I am leaving on a trip". It's from Sir Ohara. Isn't this the poem, "Kisen Hoshi"? (The Monk Kisen). "My lowly hut is Southeast from the capital. Thus I choose to live. And the world in which I live Men have named a Mount of Gloom". Sir Ohara is a man of well-cultivated tastes. He chose this poem to match our Sensei. In Honjo or Fukagawa... ...where there are lumber dealers... Is there a town that has "suka" in its name? Yes, there's Suka-gawa. Is there a landmark with "uzu" nearby? The bridge on Suka-gawa is called Uzura Bridge. That's it. SUKA-GAWA UZURA BRIDGE Beware of fires! NATIONAL LUMBER WHOLESALER We tried to get Lord Yanagiwara, who came to Edo as an imperial envoy to lead us, but he declined, saying we were too radical. But action is what makes this world. Therefore, at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow... Group 1 will attack him in Shinagawa and hold him hostage. Groups 2, 3 and 4 will take that time as an opportunity to revolt in their assigned spots. Do you have the gunpowder ready for it? I have 30 barrels of it in the basement. What about the military funds? Thanks to the fires, the lumber sales are about 700,000 ryo. The profits are estimated at about 500,000 ryo. If Edo city should burn down completely next... We can estimate sales to be about 1.2 or 1.3 million ryo. That should make our undertaking worthwhile. Just one thing, though... Our noted leader, Yui Shosetsu, who is Yui Hayato's father... ...met with failure due to an unexpected betrayal by a comrade. If there should be anyone here... There's no one like that here! We've made a pledge! But there's been a small leak. The indecisiveness of your older brother, Murao Shinjuro... ...had gotten the police officers on our tail. We were kind enough to take you in after his death. But you forgot your debt to us and tried to escape. If you want to be forgiven for it, take a good look at the faces here and point out the suspicious ones. They are all unfamiliar faces. That's not good! You shouldn't lie to protect someone! I tried to protect Shinjuro, Itoji's older brother, and overlooked Takigawa Gunpei's suspicious actions. So I was overcome with a guilty conscience, and suffered terribly for the past few days. I, Ido Jinzaemon, who had turned Shinjuro down, is suspiciously here. You should tell him that. Calm down! "Haste makes waste". Besides, it's overforyou. The Overseer, Fire and Theft Squad, and City Police will be rushing in here shortly. I'm lying. Did I take it a bit too far? This place is tightly surrounded. Will you resign to yourfate and submit to arrest? Wait! If this sword strikes me by mistake, I'll be injured! We're not surrounded by the authorities! There are only three of them out there. And one is an old man. Damn you! I'll kill you! Itoji, stay close to me. It's by the lumberyard across the river! Sir Ido! Ume'mon! Hurry! The Mito Mansion is up ahead! If the fire spreads to Engan-ji, we won't be able to stop it. They set the fire, after all. Bizen, guard the mansion. Where are you going? I'm going to assist my father. Let's go! It won't go further from here! It's a shame for a samurai like you to be a ronin. Shall I ask the lord of my province, Tsunaeda, to employ you in his clan? Thank you for your kind offer, but... I have absolutely no interest in serving a lord. I don't know how much stipend I'll get though. You would get 200 koku. My father and Shinjuro's father served Kato Tadahiro, the former lord for the 530,000 koku clan in Kumamoto. When the clan was abolished, they were exiled to Dewa, and lived a hard life there. In desire of regaining his former status, Shinjuro got involved with a bad group and was killed. But I enjoy the life that I have now. I just need 2 koku of rice in an entire year. If I get 200 koku, what will I do with the remaining 198 koku? The extra amount will only give me extra burden. I feel sorry for the lord of the 320,000 koku Mito clan. He has 319,998 koku worth of extra burden. The construction work I do will get me my 2 koku of rice. Then I can come here everyday and live it up with them. If I leave, they'll feel a bit lonely without me. And the Boss will have no one to take it out on. Don't let it get to your head. Please don't be offended. Jinzaemon, I understand very well. Let me sing foryou now. THE END
