THE GARDEN Chapter 1: In which we meet Jakub and his crippled father, and in which we learn about their great worries. Lady Tereza shall also be present. Welcome. - Good afternoon. - I was expecting you tomorrow. I have already finished something for you. Please undress yourself. Just a minute, darling. Tereza, don’t. What is wrong with you? You know... it now takes a bit longer with me. Do you feel that? What? Here. A small lump. Maybe I have got cancer. You don’t mean that. And here. Now here. Do you feel it? Now I am starting to feel something. You’re an animal. What are you doing, Jakub? Mrs. Tereza is my customer. And you, madam? Aren’t you married? You have two little children... what has gotten into you? Stop covering yourself... and get dressed. Look at the way he looks. Weren’t you supposed to be sick? - Just go and finish that sleeve. - Say what? This is still my house! Just leave us alone, father. When will you ever sod off? - You just sit here, doing nothing. - I’m on holiday. - I shall start teaching next week. - To hell with your teaching. Ten years of teaching got you nothing. You don’t even have your own flat. - Unbelievable! - Baruch. Here, have some. He pisses all over the place. He smells. - You should get him castrated. - Don’t listen to him, Baruch. He doesn’t like you. Sell grandfather’s garden and buy a flat for yourself. I don’t want to see you here ever again. Chapter 2: In which Jakub, tired of the vicious urban life, arrives in the divine garden and experiences a variety of occurrences. And where he discovers a mysterious diary. “The year of our Lord 1912. “Observations of nature: “Bats are gifted with a very strong drive to mate. “They disregard all laws of nature; “As soon as a pair meet, being male or female, “they immediately start mating.” Chapter 3: In which Jakub decides to put things in order, tastes of dog’s insidiousness, and encounters a mysterious maiden. Go away! Is that your animal? Don’t shout at him. You’re scaring him. Let go! Get lost! Hold your dog! He might eat me! Go away, you hound! Get lost! Will he come back? I don’t know. That wasn’t my dog. How did you get that? My mother has beaten me. Here too. And recently with a hose. You see? What is your name? Helena. - My mother thinks I’m a loony. - A what? “In the beginning, when God created all, He gave the sun, “the moon and other planets a certain power, “which they send to the earth, “and without which neither plants, animals nor humans “would be able to reproduce, the way they do at present. “How many planets are there? “Apart from the Sun, there are seven big ones: “Mercury, “Venus, Earth, “Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, “and Pluto.” Chapter 4: In which Jakub meets a certain Benedikt, who wants to become a saint. From him, he will taste pieces of his wisdom and also learn about humility. Here, eat this. What have you done today? - Nothing. - Then you’re not living right. Earning one’s daily bread is a gift from God. It protects us from temptation and sin. What will you leave behind... if you do nothing? Then what should I do? Wash my feet. God has spoken to me. He woke me and told me: “Benedikt, if you wish to be a saint, you must then stop wandering. “Find a place that pleases you, and build a house there. “Herd your cattle there and cultivate your lands. Let time be not you enemy.” Do you think God exists? God knows. An agnostic answer. That’s easy for you to say; you haven’t seen Him. But I have spoken to Him and now I have to live up to that. Chapter 5: In which Jakub has to challenge the traps of maternal love, the poor chicken falls asleep by magic, and Jakub cannot believe his own eyes. She has come to apologise. For what? Please don’t be angry with her, she will throw herself at any man. And some men even... take advantage of it, you know? - Why do you beat her? - Me? She has always been a difficult child. What have you made up this time? We were in our fifties when we had her. She is stupid. She cannot even write. I can. You see? Lying again. Scribbling. Sheer nonsense. Go ahead and open it. She’s just like her father. Just as crazy. All he did was sleep. One time I sent him to hospital and he never woke up. Chapter 6: In which Jakub has a quarrel with his lover Tereza, and returns to the bosom of the divine garden, despite the wasps. - Hi. - Tereza, go away! Tereza! Let go, Tereza! Stop it! Get out of here! We’re going to be stung! What are you doing here? We haven’t seen each other for a week, and now you ask me that? What do you want from me? It itches so much. Then scratch it. It’s swelling. Take it off. Now here. - I went to the doctor yesterday. - And? I’m okay. I thought I had a tumour... but it was nothing. Wait until it dries. I always want to feel you inside of me. Always. What is this? That is you. Come back with me. I got stung everywhere. What will you tell your husband? I don’t know. I’ll make up some story. We’d better end this. Don’t say that, not even as a joke. Or I will kill you. Get out. You can take a bus from here. I thought you would come with me. I will stay for a few more days. Do you really want to leave me here? This is for your children. The bus will arrive shortly. “This autumn, with God’s help, I have managed... “to brew slivovica from our plums. “It turned out remarkably well. It is strong yet delicious on the tongue. “I have decided... “not to drink from it, but to bury it in the garden.” Chapter 7: In which Jakub repairs his house, and recreates some of Houdini’s spectacular tricks. The wondrous maiden also restores his rest and power, by means of healing ants from the divine garden. Wait! Ouch! That hurts! - Did she hit you again? - She thinks I’m sleeping with you. I know how to treat it. It will be gone tomorrow. Who taught you to write? Your grandfather. He also taught me the names of all the capital cities. Why have you never attended school? I couldn’t speak for a long time. I was born this small. There are ants over here. Don’t kill them. There are everywhere. That is good. They can heal. But I am all right. That doesn’t matter. They will find something. Chapter 8: In which Jakub encounters a certain Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and makes a good deal with him. He also learns about the downside of progress, and about the bliss of poverty. Hey, you! Give me a hand. Me? My name is a certain Rousseau. You will help me. This so-called new technology really gets on my nerves. Progress means nothing but decadence of humanity. You should take it to a garage. Out of the question. That would mean that I accept the status quo. Oh, God, release us from knowledge, and impose on us with innocence and poverty. Do you think that would help? We all are victims of our own false self-respect. We don’t live, while we try to convince others that we do. Quit talking this nonsense, we’ll never make it to the wedding. Stop getting on my nerves! Can’t you see I’m working on it? This is the result of our pathetic education. A few years ago she was a marvellous woman. Holy simplicity, and with a pure soul. And I, fool, have taught her to read and to write. Since then she has been intolerable. Quiet, you bastards! Again. Be quiet! You’ve broken it. I told you I don’t know much about cars. This is a disaster. What am I supposed to do now? Is that yours? Then I will borrow it. But I need it. For what? This luxury is a punishment... for our attempts to abandon holy innocence. Let me tell you something: No man genuinely lives... according to his own true feelings, instead of social conventions. - Get in. Don’t leave anything here. - Hurry up. Let your spirit grow in wisdom. Chapter 9: In which Jakub and his father pursue a quest of knowledge and undergo a metamorphosis of body and mind. Many songs will be sung as well. When do you plan to get up? The school sent this. They expected you three days ago. Where were you? How did you get here? By bus. - The cat has disappeared. - Baruch? Yesterday’s milk still was left untouched. My father was crazy about boxing. Twice he broke my nose. I rather wish to set fire to this place. That Tereza of yours came to visit. What did she want? She brought me a box of chocolates. A nice person. I like sewing for her. Don’t move. Can you imagine: women just don’t excite me anymore. Even pictures in dirty magazines do absolutely... nothing. And how about you? When will you get married? You should have some kids. Then I could play with them. What did she want from you? She told me she is getting a divorce. You two would make a nice couple. Now what have you done to me? I told you not to move. I look like a complete idiot. How can I face my customers like this? Your turn. Where is your car? I have traded it for this one. And what brand is this one? No idea. I’ve never driven a car. But I wouldn’t be afraid of driving this one. What’s wrong? - Let’s switch seats. - Why? Try it. What do I do? Put your foot on the gas. Which one? The short one. Can you reach it? Slowly release the clutch. And we’re off. A good deal. Why don’t you just sell that garden? I’ve never liked that place. I always felt lonely there. Father was always playing some trick on me. Once he hung me from a branch, and left me there until I was completely exhausted. He wanted to make a man out of you. At one time he dropped me into a well with only a burning candle. I don’t even know why. I nearly drowned. When I was fourteen, I fled to Bohemia, and there I learned my craft. When will you return to school? I will tell them that you are ill. I can’t stand that noise! What would you like to hear? For example: ‘Pardon me, boy... Is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?’ Or something with a Spanish rhythm. You like that? Watch this... Fuck, this is so beautiful. Chapter 10: In which the bodies of Jakub and the mysterious maiden will merge by means of the fruit of the divine garden. Also he gets rid of Tereza in a harsh manner. Jakub will be using fire to send mysterious messages to the Universe. - Argentina! - Buenos Aires! - Madagascar! - Antananarivo! - Malaysia! - Kuala Lumpur! God bless you, apple tree! Last night I saw a great white caterpillar. It was squirming amongst the trees, eating everything in its way. I was inside its belly. It was nice and warm in there. You were there, as well. Why don’t you leave your mother? And go where? - Don’t. - Why not? - I just want to wash your feet. - Don’t touch me. Stop it, please! Everyone just wants to touch me. But your feet are dirty. “As for the potato, we owe our gratitude to Mr. Francis Dra-ke...” Drake. “...Francis Drake, a Dutch captain... “who has brought the crop from the Americas “to our European lands “in the year of our Lord 1586.” I’ve washed my hair in nettle. And now I feel a bit dizzy. “Potato bread is also good for fighting off hunger. “During the kneading of the dough, one should add some caraway “as to give the bread more flavour.” Palko, Michal, keep your clothes clean. Stay inside for a while. Good afternoon. I am Tereza’s husband. May we come in? Go and play. - Let’s play tag! - Let’s go. A nice autumn. But it will be a long winter. Too many wasps. I know. I have spoken with the ants about it. How long have you known each other? I don’t know. My father makes dresses for her. What do you mean, you don’t know? Almost two years. My wife wants to destroy me. She claims that you are sleeping with her. Are you? With her? No. How about that? Don’t be ashamed in front of him. Just tell him how you screw me every week. Seriously, are you sleeping with her or not? Don’t get me wrong, but wouldn’t get hard from her. And madam should stop making up stories. You filthy bastard. Behave yourself! You don’t believe me? Then I will show you how he fucked me! Let me go! This is how he fucked me! - Compose yourself! - Let me go! Stop it. She takes everything too personally. She is very sensitive. A fine garden. I bet it will give you some twenty odd litres of slivovica. Chapter 11: In which Jakub encounters the wise Wittgenstein, and, by means of his erudite words, perceives his own situation. What are you doing here? I’ve covered you, so that you don’t get cold. I got lost. A man told me he would show me the way. I was walking with him on a nice straight road. Suddenly the road was gone and the man said: “Now you must find your own way.” He then disappeared and I wandered through the night. And by dawn I was lead to you. I like it here. My father buys places like this for people from Vienna. Wittgenstein, does that ring a bell? - Wouldn’t you like to sell it? - No. You don’t feel well? That is good. I think that today’s education... undermines a person’s capacity for suffering. Nowadays a school is considered a good one only if children have fun there. Suffering is no longer appreciated, because it does not render anything. How much would you ask for it? Well, how much would you pay for it? I don’t know. It isn’t worth much. There’s nothing around. No shops, no hotels, no car rental, not even a school. There is a school. But what do they teach there? Only the new stuff. Nobody is aware that all existing things first have to be sorted out. And only then can there be order in what’s already known. At least sell me... one single tree. You may have this one. On two conditions: You are not allowed to chop it down and I can do with it what I want. - For the rest it’s yours. - You make me glad. But what am I to give to you? Take this book. It is a good book. “When a man has problems, “it is like being in a room from which he cannot escape. “He tries the window, but that is too high. “He tries the chimney, but that is too narrow. “Until he looks around and sees that the door was open all this time.” Wonderful, isn’t it? Don’t you have any problems? I do. But a man should keep silent about that. I understand. Chapter 12: In which Jakub feels remorse, and gives back the soul to the wondrous maiden. The cat Baruch will also contribute with his magical powers. - What do you want, antichrist? - Where is Helena? She is not at home. Look what you have done to her. She has been like this for three days. Does she eat? Not one bite. I pray for her, but the Lord won’t listen to me. Helena. I know she is dying. Last night the Angel of Death appeared to me. Would you like some water? Baruch! I am thirsty. Chapter 13: In which a purified Jakub is transformed into a tree. He also finds, after a fierce battle, and with the help of the wondrous maiden, a blissful reconciliation with his father. Stay with me here until winter. I cannot. Why not? The rabbits would eat me here. Now nothing can harm you. Stay with me. I cannot do that. I have to return to school. Do you recognise me? You’re my father. And do you know who you are? Right now I’m a tree. How I would like to chop you down. Has he gone nuts? No. I am the one who is a bit of a loony. Here. This letter arrived for you. What does it say? - The school no longer counts on me. - You have been fired, right? What is that? ‘Floating Island’. What’s wrong? Put them on. What? You’re driving me crazy! What kind of man are you? What do you want from me, dad? You left me alone, in that city. That empty flat is driving me crazy. And I have to take care of your entire mess. - Like what? - “Like what”?! What about the bullshit with that Tereza?! All my customers are leaving me! I look like an fool! Dad! I can’t anymore. Go and lay next to her. I will sleep here. No need for that. Sit up, my dear. She is pretty. Old age is a vile thing. Chapter 14. By winter I started to give classes in the local school. Helena is a good pupil. She is attentive and a quick learner. She also teaches me to understand everything that is incomprehensible in our real world. What is she doing? She is floating. In the end, everything is the way it should be.
