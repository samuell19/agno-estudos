NARRATOR: Just a few miles from Hollywood... ...is the largest studio in the world... ...the home of Warner Bros. pictures. This is the entrance to a world of glamour and enchantment. Through these portals pass the most beautiful trucks in the world... ...bringing to the studio many different things necessary to produce a picture: Equipment, costumes, everything, in fact, from an airplane to a hairpin. It's just an average day in the studio for most of our people... ...but it seems to be a special event for the director. Mr. Trent's on the phone, Raoul. Hello, Arthur. You're my favorite producer... ...and l'd do anything in the world for you except that. All right, let's finish this clambake. -Yes, this is King Vidor. Put him on. MAN: Have you made up your mind, King? l've made up my mind, Arthur. Get yourself another boy. l'm a director, not a butcher. -Oh, Mr. Curtiz. -Yeah? -Mr. Trent is on the phone again. -Tell him stop calling me. -My third no is final. -Yes, sir. WOMAN: Yes, Mr. Trent. l'll take care of it. And David Butler is here to see you. -You're in, Mr. Butler. -Thanks, honey. Come in, David. l have great news for you. BUTLER: Arthur. l want you to know... ...that Curtiz, Walsh and Vidor have been calling me all morning... ...fighting to do this new picture l'm producing. -But l'm saving it for you. -Well, thanks. You're gonna direct Mademoiselle Fifi starring Dennis Morgan. -Great. -And Jack Carson. lt's been nice knowing you. [lNTERCOM BUZZlNG] Yes, sir? MAN: Have you talked any director into doing the Morgan-Carson picture? No, sir. lt seems there's only one man who'll direct a picture with Jack Carson in it. We have to start shooting by Friday. Whoever it is, get him. -But just a minute-- -Get him. Yes, sir. Warner Bros. started talking pictures, now they're gonna finish them too. l won't let them do it to me. Do you know what it'd be like with that guy in charge? -Yup. -l love Carson, he's a wonderful guy. But he's such a big ham. With him in front of the camera and behind the camera... ...where do l wind up? Yup. He'll give himself every love scene with the girl, every good line, every close-up. The only thing the audience will see of me is the back of my head. That's better than the front of Carson's. At least l'd like my own mother to recognize me. Yup. What am l knocking myself out about a picture for anyway? l always wanted to go to Broadway. The theater, the thrill of an opening night. Doesn't it make the blood pound in your veins? Yup. Well, thanks, Coop. -You've been a big help. -l have? Yup. MAN: Say, the studio isn't really serious about letting Carson direct a picture? -Serious? They're mad about it. MAN: l can understand that. CARSON: Jealous. Well, well, well. Jack Curtiz in person. That's the trouble with actors, Ronnie. No appreciation for what we do to make you look good. Morgan would love to hear you say that. Don't think it's gonna be easy directing Dennis. l love him, he's a wonderful guy, but he's such a big ham. Well, what makes you think you'll have trouble with him? CARSON: You know Morgan, always trying to get his face in the camera. -l may have to turn him around. -So you can get your face in the camera. CARSON: Yeah, yeah. Well, now, let me get this straight. -You love Dennis. -That's right. -He's a wonderful fellow. -One of the best. -But he's such a big ham. -The biggest ham in Hollywood. -Good luck. -Thanks. -Hi, genius. CARSON: Hello. Oh, hello, Dennis. l was just saying some nice things about you. l know, l saw the razor. Wait a minute, you didn't finish my nails yet. You got teeth, haven't you? -Hello, Mr. Morgan. -Hello, Agnes. -A New York haircut, nice and short. -Yes. Hey, wait a minute, Dennis. Not too short. Don't forget, we're gonna do Mademoiselle Fifi. About the gay '90s. We need some of that fluff around our necks. -Very short. -Yes, sir. Dennis, as your director, l insist you look the part... ...or else we'll get you a wig. Fine, while you're at it, get somebody to stand under it. Wait a minute, you can't quit the picture now. -You can't do this to me. -Why not? lf you're not in it, they'll cancel the whole thing. Don't be silly, Jack. You're gonna be the director, the star. You're gonna see the picture. lt's a round robin, you can't miss. -Just a minute, please. -Yes, sir. Look, l may as well be frank. l'm broke, l need the money. l'm building a house, l just bought a car. l gotta make this picture right now. Money isn't everything. Money brings unhappiness. l gotta get a hunk of that misery or else the sheriff will get me. l'd like to help you, but l've got a deal for a show. The producer's in town today from New York. l'm running through some numbers for him. Great score too. Why don't you drop over the recording stage later and eat your heart out? Pretty soon, that's all l'll have left to eat. l'm not a bit moved. Tomorrow l'll be on the train heading East. Yeah? Look for me, l'll be on the track. Stretched across it. No, l can't do it. l need the money. [SlNGlNG] I'm no music critic Still I know the songs I like And this bebop has got to stop It's time to call a strike You're making a big mistake. His voice will never get over in New York. So if there's anything That you can do about it Give me a song With a beautiful melody He gets so far off-key he needs a compass to get back. Play it with strings Till it sings in my memory You need a trained voice for your show. His isn't even housebroken. Remain in your heart If it takes you way back to the past It's the kind of a song that will last And if the words to the tune Seem to say what you're thinking of Just sing the words to the girl And she'll fall in love His really isn't such a bad voice. lt's just a little delinquent. And when you're holding her tight You'll find I'm as right as can be She'll be glad that she fell To a beautiful melody That's right, you phony tenor, trample it to death. And when you're holding her tight You'll find I'm as right as can be She'll be glad that she fell Because she's under the spell Of a beautiful melody You can't take him to New York after that, can you? -l should say not. -l didn't think so. l can't even take my wife to Pasadena. l'm the janitor. Congratulations, you were great. And we'll sign the contract tomorrow. MORGAN: Thank you very much. When you hit New York with that song, it'll sweep the country. Well, thank you, sir. Thank you. Grace. Here, take this to Jack Carson's dressing room. Oh, no, l'm too young to die. -Please, let me take Mr. Carson's lunch. -Are you serious? l've been in Hollywood three months and l haven't had a chance yet to audition. l got news for you: You're not getting one now. Thanks. lf you're not back in half an hour, l'll send out a searching party. What's the rush, young lady? Sorry, Mr. Greenstreet. l was running to Jack Carson's dressing room. That's a switch. They're usually running when they come out. CARSON: Who's there? -Lunch. CARSON: Come in, lunch. But you can't stop building now, there's only one wall in the bathroom. Look, l'll get the money. l'll-- Do you wanna buy half a house? Combination sun deck and bathroom. Look, any time you're ready. Unless you want me to eat out of your hand. Oh, l'm sorry. -This is a delicious lunch. -l wish it wasn't. -l better not get used to eating. -Pot cheese and sauerkraut. -lt's good for what ails you. -lf it isn't, it'll give it to you. You're new here, aren't you? l've been at Warner Bros. a little while... ...but in Hollywood three months, four days and 22 hours. A native, huh? lt's so different from the little town l come from. Oh, you probably never even heard of it. Gurky's Corners, Wisconsin. l never heard--? l come from Milwaukee, that's only 1 4 miles from there. l'll never forget one Saturday in Gurky's Corners. l had the most wonderful.... What am l doing? l'm supposed to be depressed. Well, l can't understand why. You're a director and a famous actor. Oh, l know if l ever get the chance to sing and act... ...l'll be the happiest girl in the whole world. Nobody's happy in Hollywood. You get knifed in the back by your best friend. Well, l know if l ever get the chance to sing and act... ...l'll be the happiest girl in the world. Uh-oh. l feel an audition coming on. Look, bright eyes, would you mind leaving? l'm not in the mood right now. How long have you been in Hollywood? -Three months. -You must have studied nights. l've been in every casting office in this town. And they won't even look at me. This is first chance l've had to be alone with a director... ...and show him what l can do, and you're gonna listen. Oh, listen. All right, Peter, maybe l am nothing to you. A tramp you picked up at Leicester Square to throw away like an old shoe. But remember this, l am a woman. [KEY CLATTERS] Yeah, that's great, kid, honest, but you're barking up the wrong director. l won't have a job myself unless l keep Dennis Morgan off that train. -And get him to sign for the picture. -No, no. Don't leave us. l'm not thinking of myself. l know l'm dirt under your feet. -But what about the baby? -What? -Your baby. -My baby. l don't even know her. Even the lowest creature crawling on this Earth... ...couldn't desert an innocent child. Hey, wait a minute. Come here, kid. The lowest creature crawling on this Earth. That's him-- l mean, that's it. Hey, you got something. -What's your name? -Judy Adams. -l could change it. -How'd you like to play a scene for me? You made me the happiest girl in the whole world. Wait a minute. Get me the Wardrobe, quick. You do me this favor, l'll give you a part in my new picture. -Now. -Oh, Mr. Carson. [HUMMlNG] [KNOCKlNG ON DOOR] Yes? -My husband must never know. -l'll be the last one to tell him. Really, if he knew l came here, there's no telling what he would do. Oh, that clears up everything. -lt's been nice seeing you. -But you don't understand. -l am Mrs. Jack Carson. -Mrs. Jack Carson? Wait over there. Go ahead, this is very interesting. Jack and l were childhood sweethearts. And last year, when he came back to Wisconsin, he swept me off my feet. We were married in my hometown, Gurky's Corners. Jack said we had to keep it a secret. lt would hurt his career. Yeah, with other girls. The snake. But we can't keep it a secret any longer. You see, l'm going to have a.... -No. -Yes. A baby. He doesn't deserve it. Now, you shouldn't be standing. Sit down and rest. -Here, take this. -Thank you. When l phoned Jack last month and told him he was gonna be a mother-- l mean, a father, his whole attitude changed. He became tender and kind, considerate. lt's hard to believe he's really human. And then he sent for me to come to Hollywood. Started building a house with a little pink and blue nursery. Ran himself into debt. And now that the picture's been canceled... ...there's nothing left for me to do but go back to Gurky's Corners. Aw, you poor kid. You know, when he told me he needed money and everything... ...l thought he was just kidding. Well, it may be my death warrant... ...but l'll sign the contract for the picture. lt's a good thing it's still here. l'll see that you get that house and that pink and blue nursery. Even though Jack will grab the room and make the kid sleep in the basement. Here. Oh, thanks. Go ahead. Go on, go on. This is Dennis. l have something for the front office. Will you send a studio messenger over? Sorry l'm late. Thank you. lt's getting late. l better get these dishes to the commissary. Yes, l guess you better. Hey, nice going, kid. You were great. Look, here's 5 bucks. Load up on pot cheese and sauerkraut. You'll have to load on plasma when l get through with you. CARSON: Dennis-- -Wait a minute, l don't want this. You promised l'd be in your picture. Mrs. Jack Carson. How stupid can a guy get? -The wife-and-baby gag. CARSON: Yeah, but, Dennis.... You ought to thank her. She gave you a chance to be directed by Carson. Direct? You couldn't teach Lassie how to act like a dog. Oh, l don't know about that. Where l come from, a promise is a promise, Mr. Carson. Pink and blue nursery, that's where l ought to be. -With a rattle in each hand. -l was so anxious to be in your picture. l was even willing to double-cross Mr. Morgan. l'll see to it that you're as good as Jane Wyman was in Johnny Belinda. -She didn't even talk in that one. -Well, you can't have everything. Now, you listen to me. l worked hard for this chance. And you think you can brush me off with $5. l'm sorry l fooled you, Mr. Morgan. But l don't think very much of you, refusing to help your best friend. l'm taking the next train back to Gurky's Corners. What's with her? What's she so upset about? -What'd you promise her? -You know, a part in the picture. The usual malarkey. Did you ever think she believed you? Oh, how could she? Everybody knows l'm a liar. Maybe word hasn't reached Gurky's Corners yet. -Made me look like a heel too. -Yeah. That kid sounded like her heart was broken. l can't worry about every girl whose heart l break. -l'd be staying up nights. -Yeah, she'll get over it. Yeah, sure. [PHONE RlNGS] Hey, maybe that's her. Or she.... Not that l care. MORGAN: Can't be her. She was gonna take the next train to Gurky's Corners. Hello? Oh, hello, Arthur. Hello, Jack, Jane Wyman is here. l just told her she was going to play the title role in Mademoiselle Fifi... ...and that you were gonna direct her personally. lt came as a bit of a surprise to her. No, no. That would be impossible. Here, Mommy, take this. Oh, thank you, Maureen. TRENT: Not without a complete rest. Suddenly called out of town, huh? -Well, l'll get another leading lady. -l just talked to the boss. lf you don't get one by Friday, you'll be out of a job. Okay, by Friday. Why don't you put on a girdle and play the part yourself? l'm going up to the front office. Maybe you could play my part too. But, Dennis. Dennis, you gotta help me find a leading lady. Look, we're pals, buddies. When you came to Hollywood, broke, didn't have what to eat... -...who gave you your first square meal? -Salvation Army. -Who phoned them? -Who gave you the nickel? That was a slug. Look, Dennis, you know Alexis Smith, don't you? -Yeah. -Well, couldn't you just talk to her? -No. -Dennis. Dennis. Wait a minute. What about Eleanor Parker? We might as well face it. You're a wonderful guy and l love you. -But you're such a big ham. -You're such a big ham, l know. No leading lady is gonna trust her career to you. -What? -Find yourself some unknown kid. Somebody who doesn't know any better. Of course. Sit down. -Let Daddy take over. -What are you talking about? -Mrs. Jack Carson. -You mean little Miss Pot Cheese? Sure, it's the oldest story in the world. Big star steps out of the part, little country girl takes over. Little country girl becomes big star. lt's the great Hollywood fable. -Hey, l think you got something there. -Yeah. l'll discover her, l'll put her to picture, l'll direct her. That beautiful doll will be grateful to me, very grateful. Oh, no, l'll discover her. l'll play the love scenes with her. We'll rehearse at my house at night. And she'll be very grateful to me. Wait a minute, she can't be grateful enough for both of us. Anyway, it won't work. l mean, those things just.... They just don't happen in real life. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, l guess you're right. l was carried away. Besides, l think she was playing you for a big sucker. Yeah, country girl, huh? Probably works behind the third bubble at the downtown burlesque. Trying to con the two of us into a part in the picture. -A couple of smart guys like us, huh? -Ridiculous, isn't it? -A couple of smart guys like us. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, l guess l'll get myself a glass of orange juice. Well, l think l'll go get a glass of milk. -See you later. -Yeah. Goodbye. Now.... What time does the train leave for Prairieville?

Good, we are tired of playing anyhow. -The way we play-- -Might cheer you up, though. Very funny. JUD Y: Thanks, l don't feel like hearing a song. Judy, l've been looking all over for you. l wanted to explain what happened in my dressing room. -You don't have to explain anything. -Wait a minute, let him explain. -Sounds interesting. -What happened in your dressing room? -Would you gentlemen mind moving on? -Only 1 0 cents, we play beautiful song. -For a quarter, we go away. -lt was 1 5 cents before. -Fifteen cents, two for a quarter. -Here. We got a good racket, lady. Don't louse it up. l don't blame you for being angry with me. When you hear what l have to say, l'm sure you'll be very grateful. Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. Train leaving on Track.... But why did Mr. Carson make all those promises? You've got to understand Jack. There's nothing malicious about him. He's really trying to be warm-hearted, generous and kind. -You two really stick up for each other. -You bet we do. lt's not his fault that his personality's just a little obnoxious. You've really got something, kid. -Believe me, l've seen them. -l'd like to believe you, Mr. Morgan. But how do l know l'm not being fooled this time too? How do l know that you and the producer are like this: lf l'm not telling you the truth, may l never see the light of day again. Game called on account of darkness. Don't believe anything this walking Blarney Stone is saying. He and the producer aren't like this: Not like that: They're not even like that: Lookit, Judy, l'm gonna be honest with you. We can't guarantee you're gonna be a star. But we're gonna do everything to see that you get a break. But l've been fooling myself. l can't act. -Hasn't stopped him. -Hasn't stopped him. l said it first. No, l'm going home and marry Jeffrey Bushdinkle. -lf he'll still have me. -But this is your chance. You've read about this: Star steps out of picture. -Country girl takes her place. -Country girl becomes a star. l mustn't listen to you. l mustn't believe you. You fooled me once, l mustn't let it happen again. -But we're on the level, Judy. -How can we prove it to you? Danny. Danny. [MUMBLlNG] He'll tell you. Can't we make her a star? MORGAN: Aren't we always on the level? -Tell her about us, Danny. Yeah, you hear that? But l'm just a little waitress. No Hollywood producer even looked at me. Because you don't dress the part. All you need is clothes. lsn't that right? We'll get her an ensemble from top to bottom. lnside out too. -That ought to do it, eh, Danny boy? -Yes. Oh, that sounds wonderful. l'll stay. Oh, thanks, Danny. You convinced her. [SQUEALS] -Did we make you miss your train? -How could you? l am the train. [HOOTS] [lMlTATES TRAlN CHUGGlNG] Oh, l've seen so many beautiful things. l don't know which to pick. l'm having the same trouble myself. This dress would look wonderful on you. -We'll take that. Have the lady try it on. -Yes, sir. Come with me, dear. Hey, what's the idea? -l don't like that dress on Judy. -Look, we have an agreement. Today, she's mine. What l say goes. All right, but tomorrow, she's mine. And off comes that dress. -l'll put it back on her Thursday. -Friday, l'll take it right off again. -Well, really? -You-- You two boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Think of what you're doing to that poor, innocent girl. -But, Joan, you don't understand. -Two grown men acting like grown men. Why, Joan, you don't think Jack and l'd take advantage of a situation like this. Are you kidding? Joan, l told you, you don't understand. l've never denied you anything. Anything money could buy l've given you. But that wasn't enough, was it? Things are going to be different. -They aren't doing anything wrong. -Just a minute. Get out. Get your things out before l throw them and you with them. Get out before l kill you. What's that for? l do that in all my pictures. -Sweet girl. -Yeah. Oh, l just love Miss Crawford on the screen. You know, l still don't like this dress on Judy. Well, you know, maybe we're wrong about the way we're handling her. -What do you mean? -We shouldn't take her to Trent's office. He always likes to discover his own talent. Running an elevator, behind a soda fountain, dancing in a chorus. Yeah, the old Hollywood fable. Hey, l just got an idea. l knew you'd make it. [TlRES SCREECHlNG & HORNS HONKlNG] l can't understand it. l can't either. But there it is. Every girl l see looks the same to me. About 5-foot-4, blond, and they all smile at me with that same sickening smile. DOCTOR: l think these lenses will solve your problem. TRENT: l certainly hope so, doctor. l don't need an oculist. l need an analyst. [WHlSTLlNG] -This ought to do the trick. -What? Even if she doesn't get the part, she can always pick up a few extra dimes. Her name is McLaughlan. She lives in the apartment below us. And her boyfriend's a policeman. Looking for Judy? -l could change my mind. -Don't bother with me. l've already had my career. Judy's not in. -You got any idea where l could find her? -l'll break it to you gently. Dennis Morgan, Hollywood Bowl, stars shining, full moon. You poor boy. lt's wonderful of you to get tickets for the Bowl. This is as good a time as any to tell you, Judy... ...l've got another ticket for you. This is a railroad ticket to Gurky's Corners. lt would never have worked. lt started out as a gag and got away from us. The two big brains, the star makers. Believe me, go on back home before you get hurt. Do you think it would be the first time l ever got hurt? l know it's gonna be tough and maybe l'll never succeed... ...but l've made up my mind and l'm a stubborn person. Thousands of girls in Hollywood as stubborn as you. l worked in the five-and-ten, eight and a half hours a day... ...to earn money so l could take dramatic lessons from Mrs. Hoskins. -And l took singing lessons too. -From Mr. Hoskins? Go ahead and laugh, but he's pretty good. -He could even help you too. -Probably, but that's beside the point. Odds are against you. Why don't you go home where they're aren't? Maybe l can't act and maybe l can't sing... ...but l wanna find out for myself, Mr. Dennis Morgan. And if you don't mind, l'll buy my own ticket to the Hollywood Bowl. You win, kid. Even if you don't get to be a star... ...Hollywood's gonna know it's been in a fight. And l'm gonna do my best to see you get a break. Oh, Mr. Morgan, you made me the happiest girl in the whole world. Anybody around here seen Dennis Morgan? -Do you feel a draft? -No, why? A big wind just blew in. -Oh, Mr. Morgan. -Sticks and stones may break my bones-- Come on. We better hurry. -lsn't Mr. Carson going with us? -Sorry, only two. Hey. Seventeenth row. Lucky l got here in time. -l'm Jack Carson. -Yes? l'd like my usual tickets. Seventeenth row. Anybody wanna use the field glasses? Oh, no. l'd rather guess at the whole thing. Well, l'm glad they were sold out. lt's so much more beautiful from up here. Except when the clouds get in your way. You know, l kind of like this longhair stuff. When l sit here listening to that Beethoven-- Wagner. That stuff, it does something to me. Makes a fellow feel like he needs a girl. Does it make a girl feel like she needs a fellow? All l can think of is how cold l am. Wish there was some way to keep warm. Maybe you'd like one of us to get your coat. Oh, that'd be wonderful, Mr. Carson. Allow me. Why, Mr. Morgan. lt'll be a pleasure. Well, as long as you're up, you're closer to the parking lot. You're closer now. All right, l'll get her coat for her, and she'll be grateful to me. Very grateful. lf l get back soon enough. Well, Judy, alone at long last. Mr. Morgan, you shouldn't hold my hand. -What would Mr. Carson think? -What would Mr. Carson think with? -And besides, Jeffrey wouldn't like it. -Jeffrey? Jeffrey Bushdinkle, my boyfriend. -Nobody's named Jeffrey Bushdinkle. -Except Jeffrey Bushdinkle. You may not believe this, but he's really awfully nice. lf this were Gurky's Corners, you know what we'd be doing? What? We'd be down at Hanson's drugstore listening to the juke box. And maybe even to one of your records too. That sounds like a song cue, if l ever heard one. [SlNGlNG] If all my dreams are not about you Blame my absent-minded heart It's really quite regretful That my heart is so forgetful When you're away It always seems to fall apart If I don't show I'm lost without you Blame my absent-minded heart Did we meet in December? There's so much it must remember And if I haven't said I've loved you from the start Blame my absent-minded heart [SlNGlNG] If I don't show I'm lost without you Blame my absent-minded heart Did we meet in December? There's so much it must remember And if I haven't said I've loved you from the start Blame my -Absent-minded heart -Absent-minded heart To coin a phrase, l hope l'm not intruding. Oh, Mr. Carson, thanks for bringing my coat. Yeah, you won't need it now. You're warm enough. Have you any future plans for the evening, Mr. Casanova? -We were going to Schwab's for a soda. -Oh, now, isn't that peachy? l'll be glad to drive you. -Oh, thanks. -Just a minute. What'll it be, folks? l want a banana split with chocolate, strawberry, vanilla ice cream... ...maraschino cherries, and don't spare the whipped cream. -What? -She must be on a diet. -Yeah. -l always had that at Hanson's. l'll have a pineapple soda myself. -What about you? -l'm not drinking tonight. Do you think you could spare me for a minute? -l forgot about a phone call. -Don't be too soon. l have a hunch he's up to something. Aren't you? Believe me, Judy. All l wanna do is arrange a screen test for you. -Really? -Really. And if Jack had any sense.... Let's see who the brain is calling. What? Oh, gee, Mr. Trent, you shouldn't talk that way. l got my mother's picture in my pocket. Oh, yes. Yes, Arthur. Yes, if you insist, we'll test the new girl in Technicolor. Spare no expense, huh? We're like that: What are you trying to do? Drive me into an early ulcer? We're not making tests of unknowns in Technicolor... ...black and white or pencil drawings. Oh, no, no, three cameras will be more than plenty. First thing in the morning, huh? All right. We'll go right to the recording stage. Recording stage? You won't even get on the lot. -And that's the way it is. -But l can't understand why. -Having trouble? -Oh, no, no. Not at all. Mr. Trent left word not to let Mr. Carson on the lot. You and Trent are like this, eh? This must be you. Sorry, Mr. Carson, those are my orders. Charlie, help me. Forget about what Mr. Trent said. We're trying to give this kid a break. Gonna record her. -Trent will thank you when he sees it. -l got my orders. Never mind. l'll take over. Now listen, flatfoot, you heard my pal. He wants to give the kid a break. Now knock off and let him in. -l got my orders. -Come on now, scram, out of the way. Listen, you don't scare me. Come here, wise guy. Just a minute. Now, look, Charlie, l've got a reputation for being tough. Do what l say. Otherwise, people will start talking, stop going to my pictures. Studio will lose money, they'll close up shop, shut down. You'll be out of a job. -l never thought of it that way. -Well, think of it that way, will you? Go ahead. Go on. Go ahead. Get in there. Now, look here. You're not gonna open that big fat trap of yours, are you? No, Mr. Robinson. -My friends can go through? -Yes, Mr. Robinson. And smile. -Thanks, Eddie. -Ain't nothing. What l won't do to keep my job. Me too. MAN: That's fine, boys. Now, the next number, we'll use the quartet. Right over here, boys. CARSON: Hold it a minute, will you, Ray? -Well, what is it now? -Don't get excited already. Well, what is it? l got some extra work for you, that's all. Sorry, but l'm tied up with the Ernie Felice Quartet. We wanna record a chorus of ''Big Fat Lie'' ... ...with Miss Adams for the test. Sorry, Dennis, l haven't got the time. Listen, Heindorf, as the director of Mademoiselle Fifi... ...l order you to do it. l won't do it. And if you don't like it, you can take it up with Petrillo. Pardon me. Are you the Ray Heindorf... ...the musical genius of the motion-picture industry? -You boys know ''Big Fat Lie''? -Yeah, we know it, Ray. -Put her on the mike. -Right. Right this way, Judy. Here. Here's a copy of the music. A sheer coincidence. What l'd like to know is this: How can she possibly sing a song she never even heard before? Do l ask that about your pictures? [SlNGlNG] I kind of believed you When you said your nights were lonely Till the day that I came by But when you whispered That I was your one and only That was a big fat lie I should've been wiser than I was And seen right through you But the moon got in my eye That stuff about "I never lived until I knew you" That was a big fat lie You must've started to fib When you were wearing a bib And such a habit's hard to break A little lie is okay But when you lie night and day That's more than even I can take You told me we ought to marry And I let you sway me Kissed my happy days goodbye And when you told that man You'd honor and obey me That, baby, was a big fat lie Let's face it. You're no George Washington. An overexaggeration Of a super prevarication Just a big fat lie -Great. You were great, kid. -Thanks. Just a second, actor. l'm the director in this picture. Didn't you like it? The pear-shaped tones came out pear-shaped... ...but the interpretation was all wrong. How would you know? Because she's supposed to be Mademoiselle Fifi. You know, French, Paris, Folies Berg?re, l'amour. When you sing, l wanna hear those postcards in your voice. -l'll run through it once for her, Ray. -Boys, let's take it again. l want the full orchestra. No offense, fellas. lt's just that my voice is so rich that l need the full treatment. -Make those violins moan. -They won't be the only ones. Sit down. [SlNGlNG] I kind of believed you When you said your nights were lonely Till the day that I came by But when you whispered That I was your one and only Ch?rie, that was a big fat lie And you know that You must've started to fib When you were wearing What you call a bib And such a habit that's hard to break A little lie that's okay But when you lie night and day That's more than even I, me I can't take that You told me we ought to marry And I let you sway me Kissed my happy days goodbye And when you told that man You'd honor and obey me That, my petite, was a big fat-- [HORNS BLOW] That, baby, was a big fat lie CARSON: Dennis, now watching, thinking. l'll give you a snap when to start. Let me hear that playback. Clear the center, everybody. Got a lot of work here. [MORGAN SlNGlNG ON RECORDlNG] -No, no, no, l wanna hear Judy's voice. -Very pretty. Judy, when you hear that song, act like you're singing it. -Okay. -And you, Dennis, just act. -Or am l asking the impossible? -Thank you very much. All right. Let's go. Judy, listen to everything Jack says, do exactly the opposite. You'll be a big success. -l'll take over. -lt's all yours. MORGAN: You can't run that camera. Wait for the crew. We can't. No time to wait. Trent's liable to find out about this any minute. After all, what is this? Just a big Brownie. l haven't been making pictures for 1 0 years without learning something. Listen, you've been living for 30 without much improvement. Listen, wise guy, l'll handle my own camera and my own cue lights... ...my own playback, my own equipment. May l make my own entrance? Yeah, if that's possible. -You're too kind. CARSON: Okay, boys, l'm rolling. Speed. Action. l'll make this a screen test Hollywood will never forget. -Oh, have you got my pills? -This is the third one today, Mr. Trent. l'm pushing myself too hard. Three pictures going at once. Two more in preparation. You ought to get away on a vacation and forget about the studio for a while. What's the matter? For just a moment, you looked 5-foot-4, blond... ...and you were wearing that same sickening smile. Are you sure you feel up to seeing the tests this morning? We'll make a stab at it anyway. [BUZZES] CARSON [SlNGlNG ON RECORDlNG] : I kind of believed you When you said your nights were lonely Till the day that I came by But when you whispered That I was your one and only That was a big fat lie I should've been wiser than I was And seen right through you But the moon got in my eye That stuff about "I never lived until I knew you" Ch?rie, that was a big fat lie And you know that Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle Fifi. JUD Y [SlNGlNG ON RECORDlNG] : You must have started to fib When you were wearing a bib And such a habit's hard to break What happened to his voice? A little lie is okay But when you lie night and day That's more than even I can take You told me we ought to marry And I let you sway me Kissed my happy days goodbye And when you told that man You'd honor and obey me That, baby, was a big fat lie Let's face it. You're no George Washington. BUGS BUNNY: What's up, doc? [GUNFlRE ON RECORDlNG] [HOOTlNG & CHATTERlNG ON RECORDlNG] [SCREAMlNG ON RECORDlNG] l think l can hear them applauding. Oh, you're in, baby. You know something? Maybe we ought to change this contract to 600 a week. But l'm not worth that much. Oh, Mr. Trent. Mr. Trent. Why, Trent will come out of there raving about you. -We'll make it 700 a week. -Pardon me, please. -Well, maybe 600's enough. -l'm sorry, sir. l'm sorry. How about 500? Do you think l can get my job back at the commissary? MAN [ON TV] : --throwing the book at him... ...and how that French Killer can take it. There he goes. He's down again, but not for long. He's right back up again. What men. How do they stand it? The crowd is going mad. They wanted action, and they're sure getting it tonight. Excuse me. l get excited at these things. -l understand, l'm the same way myself. -Yeah. You can't tell me these matches are not on the level. The Swede is suffering. Even though Mr. Trent had a nervous breakdown and has to go... ...the picture is canceled, and they foreclosed on your house... ...l want you to know l'm not discouraged. He's hitting the Swedish Maniac with everything but the referee. All right, so I'm a liar. What if you can't be in that Broadway show... ...because they found somebody else? You might've been terrible in it anyway. l believe in looking at the brighter side. Anything goes in there tonight. Down on the mat again. And they both got a hold. Now what's gonna happen? Oh-oh. What a switch. Mr. Trent hasn't left town yet, you know. Oh, if l could just get the chance to sing for him. Whoa, nelly, he's really squeezing and putting it on. But the referee wants to see and nobody's gonna stop him. He's right in there for a close look, but maybe he looked a little too close. He's getting squeezed himself. He can take it too. He got himself in that fix. It looks like he'll have to get out of it same way he got in. But you can't give up. You've gotta be like them. The Swedish Maniac and French Killer, fighting for their countries. -Swedish Maniac and the French Killer. -Two guys from Milwaukee. Yeah, named Sam. Gotta have that foreign bill up to draw in suckers. -Otherwise, they wouldn't draw flies. -Flies, they might. l don't believe it. lf that was a fake, Hollywood wouldn't fall for it. The French Killer's weakening, the Swede's got him. Hey, hold everything. Say something in French. -Mademoiselle from Armentieres. -That's great. What's Arthur Trent looking for? An established star for Mademoiselle Fifi. Okay, we'll give him one. -Direct from Paris. -We'll change the color of her hair. Her makeup, her wardrobe. --kicking, punching, biting. They'll put the picture back on schedule, l'll get my house back, my new car. [SPEAKS lN FRENCH] His arms around the Killer's neck. He's getting weaker and weaker and weaker.... Here are your train tickets, Mr. Trent. You have Compartment B, Car 1 6. You know this will be my first vacation in 20 years? lt'll do you good. Pretty decent of the studio to pay my expenses... ...make my reservations for me, tell me to stay as long as l like. Who's trying to get rid of me? Who wants to put the knife in me? Why is everybody being so nice? Mr. Trent, your nerves are getting the best of you. Yes, l guess you're right. lt was awfully nice of the studio to arrange this trip. But why so soon? What are they trying to do to me? [PHONE RlNGS] Mr. Trent's office. lt's The Hollywood Reporter. Oh, probably calling to say goodbye. -Hello. -Hello, Arthur.

Fourscore and seven years ago, l wrote the same one. l could've gone back to my home town... ...and married a guy who was crazy about me. But no. l wrote him and said l chose a career instead. Hm. Some career. Lettuce and tomato on rye. Hold the mayonnaise. But this is different, Judy's got talent. We'll figure out something. Why don't you two stop giving her that hokey routine? She likes this Jeffrey Bushdinkle and he likes her. -l like Judy too. -Oh, l like her very much. From what l have gathered, Jeffrey wants to marry her.
