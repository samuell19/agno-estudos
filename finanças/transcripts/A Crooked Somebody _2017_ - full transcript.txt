♪ Ah yeah ah yeah ♪ Can't stop doing what you want to ♪ ♪ Turn back We're taking it solo ♪ And now, for an evening of psychic entertainment... bring your hands together, and open your hearts. Please welcome... Michael Vaughn. Brian is asking me to take your hand. May I? Your son loved animals, didn't he? Oh, yes, he rode horses his entire life... right up until the end. And I'm seeing-- he's showing me one horse in particular. It's a shiny, dark coat, brown or black, maybe. When he was a kid, we had a brown mare named Indy. Gorgeous animal. You're seeing Indy? Well, it's pretty tough to miss her. Brian's only riding her 24-7. And you know what else? You've never seen a smile like the one on his face. There's no more pain, there's only joy... but with the joy, I am seeing a stone wall. And when I'm shown a wall or a fence, it usually means... it was a guarded relationship, maybe some things left unsaid. Plenty of love there... but it was rarely expressed. Wasn't your idea to come tonight, was it, Earl? No, it sure wasn't. Cynthia.It's okay. It's in your nature to be skeptical. You're a practical man who doesn't like the idea... of some fast-talking out-of-towner... digging into his personal affairs. But the fact that you let Cynthia drag you here tonight... that tells me that you've got a big heart, Earl... that you'd do anything for your family. Brian knows that, too... and it means a heck of a lot to him that you're here. Now that you've got him here... is there anything you want to say to your son? I love him. Tell him directly. I love you, Brian. Tell him like you really mean it, Earl. Tell him like you wish you had before he crossed over. I love you, boy, and I miss you so much. Brian loves you, too. But you gotta chip away at that stone wall. Not just for Brian's sake, for the sake of your children... that haven't crossed over yet. You do have other children, don't you? Yes, two girls. You gotta do it for your daughters, Earl. Yeah, yeah. And for that grandson... who's gonna be joining your family soon. You see a grandson on the way? I may have said too much. Thank you both for coming tonight. I've got a strong male spirit coming in... for someone in this section. The first name starts with a "juh" sound. So, either a J or a G. Maybe a John, a Jeffrey, a Jim. Sir, is this connecting with you? Are you sure? This is a father or a father- type figure. Jacob. George. Definitely for someone in this section. I've got a lot of images coming through. Okay, I'm gonna leave that one then. I've got a feeling he'll be back. This guy's got a lot to say. Folks, I want to help connect you with your loved ones... but I can't do that if you're not making yourselves available. So please remain open and ready to accept connections. All right? Um, I have an older female spirit coming in... for someone in this section. They want me to talk to a Debbie or Darlene. Does anyone in this section have a name like that? My name's Debra. Debra, why is this spirit showing me an album cover... for the Mamas and the Papas? Oh my god, my grandmother's name is Cassy. We always called her 'Mama Cass.' Well, say hello to your Mama Cass, she's in the room with us. Uh, do you have a copy of my book? Printer says they're having trouble keeping up with demand. Is there a place online where I could maybe get it cheaper? Hey, I'll tell you what, that one is on me. Are you serious? Only if you promise to bring that husband... the next time I come through town. I absolutely will. Thank you so much.You're welcome. Mike. How you doing? Oh, can't complain. Where's Mom? She's at home, getting ready for tomorrow. We've got two services in the morning. No rest for the pastor's family. Well, she missed a good one. Plenty of, uh... strong connections. Want to take her a souvenir? A calendar with my face on it? Publisher said they were gonna send you... a couple copies of that, did you get them? I believe we did, yeah. Good. Have you heard from your brother? He said he left a couple messages. Yeah, I owe him a call. Been pretty busy, the tour, and the book-- He and the family were out over Easter. Sounds like he's got more than he can handle at work right now. He said he might be able to use someone with your talents. Really? Is he selling townhouses to dead people now? I believe it's your power of persuasion he had in mind. Nice of him to think of me, but my hands are pretty full. I got a lot of cities to go to... a lot of people counting on my help. Mike, when you were a birthday party magician... at least those folks knew they were being bullshitted. Don't forget this one. I'll give Mom your best. Hey, double scotch on the rocks, please. Uh, what's your brand? Cheapest. Oh, hello, Mr. Vaughn, your show tonight was something else. Stay in my room tonight. Well, that's very forward of you, but I'm afraid I-- Cut the shit, Chelsea, please. What are you doing? 39. Could we do this somewhere else? But we filled 39 whole seats tonight. That's cause for celebration. The turnout was bound to be light, it's our first time here. And our last time here. Go to bed, Michael. Let's just admit this is not working. We have a calendar full of shows... we have a book out. That nobody's buying. By this point, John Edward was on TV every night of the week. He that compares is he that despairs. And she that speaks in annoying rhymes is... you. Where's the waitress? Look, you're gonna get what you want... as long as we stay the course. And that means following the rules. Like, you don't drag me into a reading unless you're sunk. I'm sunk. I've put the same amount of years into this as you. You don't get to hang it up... because Daddy didn't say he was proud of you tonight. How are we doing here? Another white wine for you, ma'am? No, we're good here. No, we are not good here. I'm still drinking. I'd like a double scotch on the rocks, please. Got it. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I said it like that. Stay with me tonight. We're not starting that up again. Come on, it'll be our final farewell, our big closer. Please don't be hungover in the morning. It's a long drive to Tucson. I'm not going to Tucson. 8:00 a.m., down in the lobby. It's been an absolute pleasure, Miss Mills. Thank you kindly, Debra... for attending my evening of psychic entertainment! Son of a bitch! Sorry, man, did I hit your car? Hello? What is this? You okay? What is this? What's happening? Remember tonight? Jim? Oh, look, right-- I'm sorry, there is no Jim. He showed you what happened, I can tell. Here's the deal, I didn't see anything... because I can't connect with dead people. Naw, naw... All right, it's a show I do-- or used to do, I'm done with it. People aren't just done being psychic. No, I'm telling you that I'm not psychic. I came to your work tonight. I know the real deal when I see it. All right, you want to know how I pulled the name "Jim"? Michael. Because nearly everyone knows a male with a J name. It's a statistical fact! That's enough from you. I play the odds... until someone in the audience fills in the blanks. Stop fucking with me! Are you done fucking with me? Sorry... I'm sorry. I'm just a little overwhelmed with this. But um, you know... I am starting to remember some impressions that Jim gave me. What impressions? He said some conflict... maybe things didn't end very peacefully between you two. And that-- and that you're carrying around... a heavy amount of guilt. I need you to tell him something from me. You can tell him yourself. He's here with us. I want you to know how sorry I am. I was out of my mind. If I could do it again... I would have never left you without a dad. There's no way in hell. He, um, he knows that, and he forgives you. He's not upset with me? No, no, 'cause-- 'cause the people that cross over... they don't experience those petty emotions like anger... and resentment, they don't even exist where he is. But he's making it clear that it's really important to him... that you let me out of here, okay? So, how about we cut me loose? Where are you going? Hey, come on, come back! Why don't you let me go? Let me go! Please! Someone... help! Help! Michael? It's me. I'm sorry you had a rough night. You'll be back on top tomorrow. Hey, listen... it would really help if I could just know your name, you know? Okay, well, either way, it means a lot to me... that you're a fan of my work, and I want to give you... something that I rarely offer to other fans... private reading. Just the two of us. You let me out of here, we can sit down, we can go over all... this Jim stuff, or anything else you want to explore. And if you're worried about me going to the police... just forget it. If I've learned one thing from the spirit world... it's that you gotta let things go, you know what I mean? It was stupid of me to come tonight. What is this stuff, what are you doing? I'm really sorry, Michael. Nobody else can know. But I don't know! I didn't see what you did! Hey! Wait, wait, wait. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Let's talk, let's talk. We can talk about it, please! Let's talk. We can talk about it! Please! Please don't do this! Please don't do this! Please don't do this! Please! I-I didn't see anything! I don't know anything! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Ja-- Jim needs me! Jim needs me! For what? What's he need you for? He-- he needs to talk to his daughter again. Stacy? Stacy, yes, Stacy! She's the whole reason that he put us together tonight... because she's still in pain, he needs me to help her. So I can help, I can help! Ican make it right, she can move on! You can both move on, but I can't help you if you kill me! Fuck, man, I gotta think. Try to get some sleep. My name's Nathan. Wait, Nathan, hang on! God-- Damn it, Michael! How did you sleep? I didn't. Yeah, me, too. How do you like your eggs? You all right back there? Uh, yeah, it's all good. Sorry about the mess, I wasn't expecting any visitors. Hey, you don't have to make me breakfast. I can just eat at the hotel. The hotel's too far out of the way. We're already falling behind as it is. For what? Stacy. That map over there, I got the route all figured out. Nevada? Did you know that they call that The Silver State? I have two shows in Tucson tonight. I can't go to Nevada. So you decided to not quit. I guess so.That's great. This shit-hole world needs your gift. Which is exactly why I can't just drop everything... and head off to... Lone Valley. It's been 20 years. He needs to talk to his daughter. But, listen, I've got a couple shows in Reno next month. I'll shoot over and talk to Stacy then. He needs it done... we go today. Your huevos. Okay, bud, we're all gassed up. Great. And I hate having to do this... but we're gonna need a few rules. Keep it to the speed limit at all times. We only stop when I say it's okay. And no calling or communicating with anybody at any time. Seat belt. Why are you back there? Just in case. In case of what? In case you break any of the rules. I checked all the local hospitals, nothing. The rental place said he hadn't returned the car. And how was he acting the last time you saw him? He'd been drinking... we got into it a little. An altercation? A disagreement, nothing serious. Do you know a reason why anyone would want to harm Mr. Vaughn? Not that I can think of. He helps people for a living. Money. Huh? I'm seeing money, that's what it's about, right? What are you talking about? Jim is showing me a dispute over money... or something of value. Slow down. You don't have to tell me, I just feel like... as your partner in this thing, it's something I should know. But, I'm sure Jim will fill in the rest eventually. He's showing you it was an accident, right? I'm seeing that, yeah. I've been clean for what, 12 years now. Not even so much as a beer. But back then, man, I was on some hard shit. And you needed money to get more of it. Yeah, but this was just a stop for gas. NATHAN I was passing through nowhere Nevada... staying off the main highways, and here's this gas station... only one guy working there. As I'm walking away... I get the idea that maybe I'll knock the place over. As I'm building up the nerve, the guy comes out... and I decide I'm just gonna grab... what's in his wallet and split. Dumb bastard had to fight back. Whoa, whoa, all right, relax! NATHAN It was an accident... a total goddamn fluke. But of course I'm shitting bricks now... so I get rid of his body and get the hell out of there. I stay fucked up for probably ten days straight. And when I come out of it... I figure the whole thing had just been a bad dream. None of it happened. STACY So if anybody out there has seen my daddy... or knows where he is... NATHAN But there she was, man... STACY ...please say something to the police. NATHAN ...on the fucking TV. I miss him and I'm scared. ANCHOR The victim was last seen... on the night of the 8th. NATHAN Her face was on every screen... and every newspaper, it was everywhere. Wait, your-- your Jim is Jim Bishop? What do you know about that? You were a kid. Stacy Bishop, dead mom, missing dad? She was like America's orphan sweetheart. I'm sorry, Nathan. You didn't deserve what happened to you that night. But think about the opportunity you're sitting on here. You have a chance to turn everything around. It's good you found me. Nathan. What is it? Why are we stopped? I don't want to worry you... but I think we might have a problem. What? It's Jim. I lost my connection to him. Well, get him back. I have an idea, but you're not going to like it. What? I need you to show me where you put his body. No way. It's a tool in the medium world. I can connect more deeply to a spirit... if I have access to its final resting place. I don't know. Nathan, without a connection to Jim... there's no talking to Stacy. Where are we? There. Are you sure? Yeah, I think so. Well, I need you to be sure. Yeah, that's it. All right, let's get out of here. Most of Mike's old friends have left town... but these folks are still in the area. Oh, this is great, thank you. More tea? No, no, I should start making these calls. I really appreciate your help. I'm curious about your grandmother Cassy. How did she pass? Or is she just part of the script? Sam, let's not go into this. Please... let me know if he reaches out? I'm trying not to worry. Of course, without him, you don't have much of a grift... do you? He's my best friend, I want to make sure he's okay. And so do we... but this disappearing and getting everybody... all riled up, well, it's just-- I'm not trying to bad-mouth him, but he's a willful boy. He always has been. When his father was in the middle of a sermon once... Mike faked that the Holy Spirit took him over. Now imagine a seven-year-old dancing around a church... pretending to speak in tongues? It was very embarrassing for us. It sounds like he was just trying to get your attention. Are you a parent? No. In a family of six, you can not baby all your children. That is just the reality. And Mike always wanted more than was possible to give him. You seem like a smart and decent gal. Why not use those qualities for something... that you can be proud of, something honorable. You know, you and Michael aren't as different as you think. How's that? You both comfort people with the promise that this isn't it. That there's something big and beautiful... at the end of the line. Miss, I will thank you not to come into my house... and compare my ministry to that con you're running with my son. I think it's time we wrap this up. Unlike him, I believe what I'm saying. I think it bothers you that he's gonna reach more people... than you ever did. Let him have his fame. Like I've told him... it's better to be an honest nobody than a crooked somebody. Well... I'll let you know if I hear from your son. Yeah. I'll just walk her out. I don't like it either, but we cannot be seen together. What-- what if there's some evidence out there... that links you back to Jim? I'm sure there's not, but why would we take that chance... when we're this close to the finish line? So what's your idea? You lay low here. I check into a room in town. And then I'll reach out to Stacy and do what I do. Why don't you just call her from that phone? Except that, that call could be traced back to this motel... which puts you in danger. No, I won't do that to you. What are you afraid of, Nathan? That I'm gonna walk out of here and turn you in? You were asleep in the car. I could have driven you to the nearest police station... and been done with you, right? I guess. I know you're not used to trusting people... but you have to trust me. I can't do my job, if I'm worried you're not safe. But it's your decision, okay? You're the boss. We'll do what you decide. I-I mean, I suppose you should go. I think it's the smart idea. Nathan, buddy, this is a beautiful thing. The next time you see me, this is all gonna be over. Hold on. Thank you. I'm uh-- I'm really glad that I didn't kill you. Um, me, too. Over there. Hi, Monica Lewis, Senior news producer. Michael Vaughn, psychic medium. What can I do for you, Mr. Vaughn? I'm in psychic communication with a man who went missing... from this area back in '96, Jim Bishop. That sounds fascinating and I can't wait to hear more. Do you have a business card I can use to contact you? I can lead you to his remains. Excuse me? Jim's spirit has directed me to the location of his remains. Now if you think that sounds newsworthy... I can lead you and your camera crew to the spot. Is this something that you've discussed with the police? The police would dismiss me as a crackpot. Like you have. I'm certainly not dismissing--It's fine. When you tell people you talk to the dead for a living... you get used to that raised-eyebrow look. Let me make it easy for you, cover the story. If I'm full of shit, then you can report on the wackjob... who's digging around the mountains... for a body that isn't there. But if it is there, and I know it is, well... seems like the kind of story you'd wanna be on the scene for. Hey, Stace? Yeah. You need to see this. REPORTER After nearly two decades, search teams... are combing the West Mountains searching for clues... in the Jim Bishop disappearance case. But what makes this search so unusual is that it's being... led by Michael Vaughn, a psychic medium who claims... Mr. Bishop's spirit has been in contact with him for days. He began sharing images with me late Saturday night. And the more he revealed... the more it became clear to me that Jim is ready to be found. I've been shown that he was killed by a blow to the head. His attacker then brought him here and disposed of the body. It's probably cold comfort at a time like this... but Jim has assured me that his death was sudden and painless. He experienced no suffering. KLNV REPORTER Mr. Vaughn managed to persuade a team... of forensic archaeologists from the University... to help in the search. And while they have yet to turn up anything substantial... the optimistic medium is not giving up hope. A young, single father was taken from his little girl... and this community, years before his time. I just hope that the information... I've been given can bring a little peace... to everyone who loved Jim Bishop. REPORTER Live from West Lone Valley... I'm Lisa Reynolds, KLMB News, Channel 6. Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, breaking for dinner? It's gonna be getting dark soon, we thought we'd call it a day. Okay, well, first thing tomorrow morning... I'll bring the coffee and the doughnuts. I can't, I have a class to teach. The rest of you guys are good, right? Michael, I'll be honest, we just haven't seen anything... that suggests a gravesite. Jim's made it clear to me that he's in this ground... and he's counting on you to find him. And if you don't find him, he may never be found. I don't think any of us are ready to accept that. So go get some sleep, okay? Okay, you guys worked your tails off today... Jim appreciates the effort. And I'll-- I'll see you first thing in the morning. I think that'll look really good. Uh, what-- what are you shooting? I'm just getting footage for tomorrow's follow-up story. The "wackjob digging in the mountains" one. He's up here.Good... because folks around here are protective of Stacy Bishop... and if they feel like you're jerking her around... you're gonna get a pretty pissed-off town on your hands. All right, Ed, you're good, let's pack it in. So you had to go on the 5:00 o'clock news? Nathan, I don't want publicity from this. All right, I'm just following Jim's orders. Nathan, for this to work, I have to know something. That spot that you showed me... is that where you put his body? It has to be. I mean, you felt him right there, right? Yes, but there may have been some other psychic factors... in play that I don't have time to explain to you right now. It was 20 years ago... it was the middle of the night, I was fucked up. As far as I can remember, yeah, that's where I buried him. Why are there noodles all on the wall? So now what? When are you gonna see Stacy? I don't know, can't imagine she's gonna want to talk... to me, if her father's body hasn't turned up. Oh, great-- I'm-- I'm stuck in a place that I never planned to come back to! All right, just calm down. So you're gonna do what Jim sent us here for! Don't you think I'm trying to do that? I'm so confused, I don't even know any more! Just what in the hell is going on in here? What the fuck is it to you, lady? I will not be spoken to like that on my property. Ma'am, he didn't mean that. I go to church with the sheriff... and you can be sure that he's gonna have someone... down here to deal with you. Fucking goddamn it! Be ready to run. I am so sorry, ma'am, that was unacceptable. Don't slam my door. You guys already owe me for a broken lamp. You know what, will this cover it? The damn thing didn't cost $200. I know, but you deserve something extra... for the um, inconvenience we've caused tonight. I don't know what kind of flop houses you're used to... but we have rules around here. Absolutely. Now there may be nicer places down in town... but I have regular customers... who insist on staying here because I run a tight ship. I do not put up with noise. I do not put up with fighting. And I do not put up with general foolishness. And you shouldn't. You work too hard to have guests acting like hooligans. Wait, aren't you that psychic from the news? Do you really think that Jimmy's body is up there... on that mountain? I do. Unless he's trying to make a fool out of me. Do you really talk to--? Those who have crossed over? Yes, ma'am. But it's less of a conversation and more like I'm shown... images, little snapshots that I have to interpret. Like now, I'm seeing an older gentleman. Someone who spent a lot of time in this office. First name begins with a K or a C? Ken was my husband. But he's been gone for two years now. You miss him, don't you? Oh, I do. Well, Ken doesn't miss you. Because to miss someone implies that you're no longer with them. Ken doesn't need to miss you, because Ken is always with you. I have felt that. What's your name? Phyllis.May I take your hand, Phyllis? Yes. Ken is so proud of the work you've done... keeping the motel running. And I'm not sure what this means... but he says that you were right about making that change. He always thought that it was a waste of money... to re-carpet the rooms. It was the first thing I did when he passed. Well, Ken loves the color you chose. You know, I uh-- I shouldn't be saying this. That man in Room 3 is a client of mine. I'm helping him through a difficult loss. He's pretty fragile right now. Yeah. So I would just appreciate you not mentioning anything... to anyone about my client or the work I do with him. No, of course not, I won't breathe a word. Thank you, Phyllis. Are we all right? Are we done acting crazy? Yeah. Then, yeah, we're all right. Hello. MONICA Michael, it's Monica... holy shit, you're amazing, they found him. What? One of those nerds started poking around 10 yards... to the south and they found human remains. MONICA What's left of the clothes is identical... to what Jim was wearing. I'm so sorry I doubted you, Michael. Please don't apologize. What's important now is that the healing can finally begin. Mr. Vaughn, any comment on this morning's discovery? Well, I'm just very proud and very humbled to have been... a small part in bringing some closure to this terrible ordeal. Thanks for calling back. MIKE Obviously I can only take partial credit. So, Michael hasn't reached out to you? Uh-huh. Okay, well, if you do hear from him... would you just get him to call me on this number? Jim Bishop, who broke his silence and led me here. And have you had any contact with Jim's daughter, Stacy? Unfortunately, I have not yet met with Miss Bishop... but I do know a reunion with her father... would mean a great deal to him. Has Mr. Bishop shown you anything... to help identify his killer? I don't have a clear picture of his identity, but I do know... that the man responsible is no longer with us. I've been shown that he took his own life... not long after Jim's death. Michael Vaughn? Detective Bill Banning. I hate to bug a guy who's in the middle of his dinner... but I just needed to come over here and thank you personally... for everything you did to help crack this Bishop case. Happy to be of service, Detective. Can I introduce you to my partner? Just take a second. Zim! Yeah. Zim! Coming. Michael Vaughn. The uh... the guy? Yeah! This is Detective Ron Zimmer.Wow. Now Zim, who was first assigned to the Bishop disappearance... way back in the day, when it first broke. Yeah, I could have used you in '96. Where the hell were you? Well, in '96, I was 14, soI was probably pretty busy... failing to lose my virginity. Wow.Have a seat. Well... to finding Jim. To finding Jim. And finding Michael. We're closing cases left and right. Are we now? You didn't hear? You're a missing person, pal. They filed a report on you back in Albuquerque... on Sunday, I think it was. Yeah, it was filed by Miss Mills, I believe. Chelsea. Chelsea Mills, that's right. Just because a guy leaves town without saying goodbye... doesn't mean he's gone missing. Christ, let's hope not. I was in a pretty big hurry. When you have a spirit like Jim who has a job... they want you to do, they want you to do it now. How you liking Lone Valley? I'm loving it. Folks here couldn't be more welcoming. They're a good breed, aren't they? Ah-- Nice people. So you must have rolled into town Monday... I would imagine, right? Bright and early, saw the sun coming up over the mountains. Beautiful drive, yeah. When the kids were little, we used to make that drive... Beautiful, yeah, it was like 18, 19 hours straight... if you go straight through. 'Course, I had the wife with me, so we'd-- we'd switch off. You did that whole drive alone? Yeah... well, not entirely by myself. I had Jim with me. You know, in my line of work, you're never really by yourself. So--Wow, I can't imagine. It's amazing. We should let you finish your steak. Thank you for stopping by. It's a pleasure meeting the guys who do the real work. Likewise, and in terms of this whole Jim thing... obviously your discovery's opened up a murder... investigation, so we're gonna need you to stay in town... for a couple days in case we have to tap that insight. Absolutely. Although, as I've said, the-- the murderer is, or was-- he's not alive. Yeah, we get that, but doing the real work... means exhausting all possibility. Understood. By the way, you're okay, aren't you, you feel okay? I'm great. You sure? Because the report in Albuquerque... said there were traces of blood found near your phone. Oh, you know what? I had a few drinks that night. I took a tumble in the parking lot, it wasn't my finest moment. That's like a Tuesday for Zim. Good to meet you. Likewise. That's the guy. Nathan. Nathan, it's Michael. Nathan? There you are. Turn it off. What are you doing? Turn it off! Everything okay in here? You should hear these fucking vultures. He's nothing but a piece of goddamn meat to them. I know, it's disgusting. But-- but I have some good news. I'm gonna get you out of here tonight. So it's done? It's-- it's going to be done. In the meantime, there's a 9:30 bus... leaving the Greyhound terminal tonight, okay? Take this, go home, I will come to you when this is all over. I'm not leaving until the job's done. Nathan, there are cops all over me. That means that you're not safe. You need to leave. Before you came, I imagined going outside and sitting... with those pricks, and telling 'em everything... the whole story. Can you imagine the look on their faces. I don't-- uh, that-- Jim would not want you to do that. Does he know how-- how tired I am... all these years of hiding and looking over my shoulder? Nathan, are we friends? Yeah. How would you like to see me, your friend, go to prison? That's what would happen if you did something like that. I'd be considered an accessory to murder. Is that what you want? I just want you to hurry up and talk to her already. Mr. Vaughn, can we talk to you? It's not a good time.Please! We need your help. What do you do for a living, lady? I'm a waitress. What if I came up to you on the street... and I demanded that you serve me an omelet? Be a little rude, wouldn't it? I'm off the clock. Our son was kidnapped, we just need to know if he's alive. We came all the way up here from Florida to see you. Please, just a few minutes of your time. Arturo was taken from his preschool... almost a year ago and the police can't tell us anything. We drove up here hoping that you could-- I don't know-- We need to know if you feel any connection to him. I'm uh, not getting anything from Arturo. So... he's still alive? It could mean a number of things... but yeah, I think he's still alive. Thank you, oh... may God bless you. So how does this end? It ends when I give a reading to Stacy Bishop. And this Nathan will just go off on his merry way? Yes. He's dumb and desperate to believe. Trust me, he's hooked. One issue is that he's a little restless. I could use another set of eyes, just to let me know... if he goes anywhere or does anything erratic. Oh, you need my help? I always need your help, we're partners. Chelsea and Michael. I had to watch CNN to find out where you were. I know, sorry about that. You didn't call me, because you knew... I'd try to talk you out of this. Yeah. The rule is we don't make any big decisions... without consulting each other. You broke that rule and now you need me to shadow a murderer. To be fair, we're not talking about the Zodiac Killer here. Talking about a guy who, 20 years ago, tried to mug... someone and accidentally broke his neck. And he taped you to a chair and almost cut your throat. It was a lot less dramatic than it sounds. Michael, we were doing just fine without this. Watching you eat alone in shitty hotel bars every night... is not my idea of just fine, you deserve better than that. We deserve better than that. I mean, my phone is full of TV and book offers. We've earned those! Michael, none of that matters, if you end up in jail or dead. I can't look at those feet anymore. Just wait, please! I fucked up. I fucked up. I'm sorry. You are the best person I know, and I let you down... but if you just stay, I swear I will never make... another move without your approval. Just please don't go... I need you. I visited your parents. Why? Because I was looking for you. Did they seem worried? I'm glad you're okay. Hi, you must be Ben. I am, hi. I'm sorry, you are? Michael Vaughn, the psychic medium who's been talking-- It was a joke, I know who you are. Nice to meet you. Okay, um, I'm sorry to just drop by like this, but-- You know, can we talk inside? The cameras are-- We're gettin' used to them. Okay, well, I'm actually here to speak with Stacy. Is she available? Uh... now's not a great time. Is there a better time? Maybe later today, this evening. It's been a tough week, Michael. She's not really ready to talk to anyone just yet. Understood. It's just that her dad is very excited... to talk to his little girl again. And in my experience, a reunion like that... can provide some real comfort. I'll tell her. Good... all right.Okay. Well, uh, this is my card. Just give me a call when she's ready. Uh, sooner than later, hopefully. As I said, her dad is just very excited to talk to her. Oh, and these are for her. Those are from me. Gosh, that's really thoughtful. Thanks for stopping by. Take care. You-- you got it.Yeah, I got it, thanks. There you go.Thanks. We're outside Stacy Bishop's house... where Michael Vaughn arrived moments ago. What's being discussed in the house, we're not quite-- He's here! Excuse me, what brings you here, Mr. Vaughn? Are you and Stacy planning to talk? Do you have any reaction to the coroner's report? What's that? The coroner's report... do you have any comment? I'm sorry, I haven't read it. It was just released... it says the likely cause of Mr. Bishop's death... was not a blow to the head, but rather multiple stab wounds. Do you have any comment? Um, as I've said... I can only interpret images that are shown to me... so, sometimes there are going to be some inaccuracies... maybe some facts left out for unknown reasons... but the important thing is that Jim Bishop gave me... the necessary information to help uncover his body. So, if you'll excuse me. REPORTER That was Michael Vaughn responding... to the latest development in the Jim Bishop case. That son of a bitch is gonna ruin everything. CHELSEA Then let's get ahead of it. Go to the police, tell them about Nathan. Tell them you felt your life was in danger, so you kept lying. MIKE No, there are still moves to make here. I just have to finish this... before Dipshit ruins my credibility. CHELSEA How? Jim's memorial is tomorrow. Stacy will be there, I'll make her talk to me... and then we are out. I'm scared to be here, Michael. MIKE You're fine... just keep your doors locked. Unless you'd feel better staying with me tonight. I'm being serious. Can we just stick to the conversation? And how are you gonna make her talk, Michael? Thank you so much for coming out today. I guess these things usually happen in a church... but anybody who knew my dad, knows that this was his church. He loved painting this place. In fact, the first time I picked up a paint brush was here. He held me up to his canvas and let me ruin... one of his landscapes, by painting a giant... yellow, smiling sun in the corner of it. My dad is gone, we know that now. But somehow I managed to gain countless dads and moms... and brothers and sisters, because of it. You guys are all my family... and I'm just so grateful, so, thank you. Come on, come on, come on. Shit. Michael... I want you to tell me what the fuck is going on. I'm sorry, sir, do we know each other? There you go, fucking with me again! You seem distraught. Is everything okay? Who is she? Who is that woman that's watching me at the motel? I don't know who you're talking about... but it seems like maybe you've had a few drinks. Fuck you. Excuse me, there are children here. Okay, maybe we should go find a nice, quiet place to talk... just you and me, okay? Look at Stacy right now. You're upsetting her. And Jim is furious with you for it. Let's go. Let's go! Sorry, it's-- it's an emotional day for everyone. Where are we going? Jim wants me to take you home. Unh-unh, we're not done. Please don't raise your voice. It's scary enough being alone with you as it is. I'm sorry, I didn't tell you. The truth about Jim's little accident? Yeah, didn't exactly help me to earn Stacy's trust, did it? I've been completely truthful with you from the beginning. I just assumed you were being the same with me. It's not just the lies, it's the fact that you're drinking again. Paranoid that some woman is watching you. You said he was furious at me. Is that true? Yes. I always thought they couldn't feel those kind of emotions. Why don't we just have a little quiet time, please? Yeah. Afternoon. Oh, sorry, guys, my rooms are all booked up. Oh, we're not looking for a room today. I'm Detective Banning, this is Detective Zimmer. We were hoping you could take a look at a picture for us. I suppose so. Good. Well, this guy right here with uh, Michael Vaughn... wondering if you recognize him. Hm... Has he been through here? Yeah. Can you hurry up? Christ, look at that sky. I get some great skies in the desert... but nothing like these mountain sunsets. Take a look... before it's gone. Chels. CHELSEA Where are you? I'm about three hours out of town. CHELSEA Is he with you? Yeah, we're out. CHELSEA Thank god. Have you been getting calls? Yeah, but I've been ignoring them. CHELSEA Good. Keep doing that. Why? CHELSEA Stacy's people released... a statement to the media. They're interested in doing a sit-down with you. MIKE Well, it's too late. She had her chance. Exactly, a live reading would be crazy. A live reading, like on camera? CHELSEA Does it matter? Why would she do that? CHELSEA I don't know, somebody probably... offered her big bucks, but you're not doing it. MIKE So, I guess the decision's been made then. There's nothing to decide. Something like that's never been done. Which is a pretty compelling reason to consider it. CHELSEA It hasn't been done... because it can't be controlled. If you sink, I won't be there to pull you out. MIKE But if I don't sink? No. It could be legendary. CHELSEA Michael, I'm begging you. For the sake of everything we've built... please just keep driving. Stop being dramatic, we're just talking. I-I gotta go. Michael, please, don't come back here! It's gone. If Jim gave you one more chance, could he trust you? Michael? Phyllis... hi. You know, all my rooms come with doors, right? I take client confidentiality very seriously. I've been waiting for you to stop by again. It would be so nice to hear from Ken. I thought of a few things I'd like to ask him. Good, good, good. When I have a moment, I promise I'll come find you. You know, a couple of detectives came by earlier. They showed me a picture of you and-- And they wanted to know if I recognized him. What did you tell them? That I'd never seen him before in my life. Okay, you did good, thank you. Of course, I don't feel so hot lying to them like that. You didn't lie to them. You protected some information to help a person in pain. There's no crime in that. I know, but it's got me all tied up in knots. Although-- What? Talking with Ken always seemed to have a way... of calming me down. Well, then maybe we should see if Ken is available. Stacy, we found this in your bedroom... and I'd love for it in the background of your shot. You're fine with that, right? Yeah-- yeah, sure.Great. ANNOUNCER until tonight's Inside America, when Stacy Bishop... and Michael Vaughn meet for the live conversation... we've all been waiting for. ANNOUNCER The usual sleepy town of Lone Valley, Nevada... is buzzing with anticipation over tonight's live TV event. ANNOUNCER will be sitting down for their first ever... face-to-face discussion... on a special, live edition of Inside America. ANNOUNCER Stacy reconnect with her father. ANNOUNCER about what will be revealed tonight. ANNOUNCER this Michael Vaughn, he comes out of basic obscurity... and all of a sudden all the lights are on this gentleman. What's your take on what's gonna happen? ANNOUNCER Michael Vaughn and Stacy Bishop will have a sit-down... and hopefully it will give Stacy-- ANNOUNCER has been overwhelming. ANNOUNCER that still remains is... who was responsible for her father's death. Mr. Vaughn, I'm Ron Cassidy... I'll be producing your segment tonight. All right, everyone, we're live in ten seconds, all right. And five, four, three-- Hello and welcome to this... very special edition of Inside America. I'm Pauline Williams. We're coming to you live from Lone Valley, Nevada... and the home of Stacy Bishop. I know that this has been a very emotional week for you... so thank you for inviting us here tonight. We're also joined by Michael Vaughn, the psychic medium... who helped police uncover the remains... of Stacy's missing father, Jim Bishop. Thank you, Pauline. I'll start with a very obvious question... is Jim here with Stacy right now? A better question might be when is he not with her? I'm asked all the time whether people's loved ones... are physically present, and I always say... that it's like a sunset, you know? Try to remember the most beautiful sunset you ever saw. Hey, man, you gotta see this. MIKE Except that it was gone. It's from the old gas station footage. We couldn't I.D. this guy back in '96. He stops in about three hours before Bishop disappears from the tape, right? Look at this. Hm? That's our guy. That's our guy! Let's go get him. Your father's body, that disposable shell, that is gone. But his spirit, your actual father... that's always with you. He's-- he's actually showing me something. I'm seeing a time that you got hurt... maybe you broke a bone, ten, eleven years old? I broke my ankle at a softball game when I was eleven. MIKE That's right, and do you remember... lying there on that field with tears streaming down your face? Yes, yeah. So does your dad... because he was right there holding you the entire time. STACY Jim just showed you that? MIKE Yes, he did. STACY Wow, that is powerful stuff. Stacy, is there anything you'd like to say to your father? Maybe some questions that you want to ask? Um, there's-- there's so much. Um... Michael, I'm actually-- I'm wondering if he's shown you someone... um, a woman named Miss Angeline. Miss Angeline? Deny, Michael. Yes, uh, I am getting a response to that name. Shit. I'm seeing that she had quite an impact on you. She did, yeah. What else are you seeing about this Miss Angeline? Well, there's a lot of powerful, positive energy around her. I feel like she may have been a teacher... or someone in a teacher-type position... a caretaker of some kind. Maybe not in a literal sense... but that's the way that Jim viewed her role in your life. Really? Stacy, who is Miss Angeline? STACY A couple months after my dad went missing... I did a talk show... the 'very special episode' like this one... and they brought in a psychic, Miss Angeline. And she sat right where you're sitting, Michael... and she smiled at me and she told me that my dad... was gonna come back before I turned 13... and I was-- I was ecstatic. I mean, I would run home from school every day just hoping... that, that would be the day that, you know... he would-- he would finally show up. And... the night that I turned 13... I sat on the front step... of my house and I had this little flashlight... that I just shined up and down the street, just waiting-- just waiting to see him... and then midnight hit... and my grandmother had to wrestle me into the house-- Sorry. I just-- I fell apart, you know, it was like... my dad went missing all over again. So, it's strange to me that you would see... all this positive energy around her. I agree, um, but I can say that we don't always know... the reasons for everything. So, maybe your father feels there was a lesson... to be learned in this. I tried killing myself three weeks later. MIKE Stacy, may I take your hand? I'd rather you didn't. It often helps to improve the psychic connection. I'd rather you didn't. Okay. Um, I obviously can't speak for this Miss Angeline... but it's possible that she wasn't fully in tune... with your father's spirit. Or maybe she had no psychic powers... and was lying to take advantage of my story. MIKE It would be heartbreaking... if that were the case. STACY Have you been lying... to take advantage of my story? Unlike Miss Angeline, I have a legitimate connection... to your father and it's important to him... that you trust that. Stacy, you do believe that Mr. Vaughn... was led to your father's remains, right? Yeah... but not by my dad. Then by whom? Maybe by the man who put him there. MIKE That's obviously impossible... as I've said, that man-- STACY Is no longer alive. Yeah, I know. Of course, you also said that my dad died... from a painless blow to the head. You're asserting that Mr. Vaughn got his information... from another source? May I say something? I'm asserting that Mr. Vaughn is not psychic. Which means, yes, he got his information from another source. Pauline, I see this a lot. MIKE Many people are so entrenched in their grief... that they will push back when I offer any ray of hope. It's an understandable emotional defense. I didn't break my ankle. I've never broken a bone. Many times when I'm shown an injury... it can represent an emotional or psychological trauma. You're a thief, Michael... you and Miss Angeline. Grieving people come to you and you steal their loved ones. I help people. And then you sell their loved ones back to them. But you've changed them, your lies have twisted them... into something else, something deformed, well, not this time. You don't get my dad. PAULINE Well, I am sorry that this sit-down... isn't providing the kind of closure... that we all hoped it would. Is there anything that Mr. Vaughn could say or do... to bring you comfort at this time? My dad was murdered and he's not coming back. So, no. On that sobering thought, we'll send it back... to our studio in New York. Thank you, Stacy. Thank you, Michael. And thank you for tuning in to this fascinating discussion. From Lone Valley, Nevada, I'm Pauline Williams, goodnight. And we're clear. Get out of my house. How do you respond to Ms. Bishop's accusations, Michael? Michael? I need you to come get me. I can't. MIKE Chelsea, goddamn it, I'm sorry, okay? You were right! I need your help! Is he with you? Yeah. Where are you? Oh, fuck-- Nathan, what are you doing, buddy? That didn't go the way that you promised. To be fair, I didn't make any promises. Nothing has gone the way that you promised. And I think we should talk it through, okay? This lady, how important is she to you? MIKE Nathan, this is not about her, okay? This is about you and me. All right, listen, I'm gonna come to you, okay? But you have to promise not to hurt her. Nathan! Shit. C'mon, c'mon. Nathan, I'm outside. Okay, I need to know that she's okay. Okay, we-- we can't stay here, there are police looking... for both of us, so take Chelsea's car and follow me. Fuck. Excuse me, you can't park here! Michael, what are you doing in here? It's a long a story. I saw you on the show earlier. I started wondering if you've been completely honest with me. Can you go the fuck back to bed, please? I gave you good news. You got to feel closer to your husband. Can you be happy with that and go back to bed, please? C'mon, c'mon, c'mon-- Hello? SAM Mike. Dad? SAM Mom and I just watched you on the TV. In the million times I imagined hearing you say that... this was not the scenario I had in mind. MIKE Listen, I can't really handle... a sermon right now. We're calling to see if there's anything we could do. I'm not sure what's gonna happen right now... but I may need to crawl into a hole for a while... so maybe I could come stay with you and Mom for a bit? SAM That'd be fine. Whatever you need, Mike. Okay, I, uh-- I gotta go. Mom and I are praying for you. I know that's not something you believe in... but it's a thing you say to... make people feel better. Thank you. SAM Okay. He may come see us, stay with us for a little while. He lied about all of it, didn't he? Didn't he? Michael tells people what they're desperate to hear. And then they do the lying to themselves. It's Chelsea, right? Uh-huh. I killed a man up here, Chelsea. 'Course, he was supposed to already been dead. It was the luckiest break of my life, he was still alive. I could have just let him walk, driven away. We could have both been living our lives right now. Keys. I'm sorry if I scared you. Michael--Let-- let me talk, Nathan. All right, there's-- there's been a lot... of crazy accusations tossed around tonight. All right, there's a lot of confusion, a lot of anger. But before you do anything, Jim wants you to hear him out. It's time to be done with the lying. Jim needs to explain, so that you understand clearly-- I need you to stop talking. Fine. Chelsea, lock the doors! I'm not gonna hurt you. Bullshit, then what's that for? So what happens now? I walk away, like I wish to Christ... I'd done that night with Jim. Well, that's good, Nathan, that, uh-- that shows-- That shows real growth, I'm proud of you. I'm trying. I told you... this was a beautiful thing, right? So let's go, let's get you home. You go on ahead. You can't stay here, they're looking for you. That's what they're supposed to do, that's-- that's their job. What are you doing? I'm trying to help you. You've already helped me, you had me convinced that I was... a-- a good person for a little while. I really liked the way that felt. But you are a good person. Like I said, we're done with the lying, all of it. You're not turning yourself in... we talked about why that's a bad idea. I thought about it, I think you're gonna be all right. You did what you did, because you were helping people. I really think they're gonna take that into consideration. That's not how it works, Nathan. I need to borrow your car. Hold on, wait! Just wait, Nathan-- Nathan, there are other moves to make here, okay? I have book deals, I have TV deals. I can make you very comfortable! That's really generous of you to offer. I can't let you do this to me, Nathan! Step aside. Not if you're going to the police! It doesn't work out. It does for me. Nathan! That was a warning! Okay, I didn't want to have to do that, but you forced me. So just-- let's talk about a solution... that could work for everyone, okay? Stop! Nathan! Let it go! Don't! Stop! No! Stop! Stop! Oh, my god! I warned him. You heard me! We're okay, it's not a problem. We are okay, all right? It's not a problem. I'm gonna take care of it. It's all taken care of, we're good. It had to happen. You heard him, he was gonna ruin everything. And honestly, he deserved it. What he did to Jim? He's a fucking monster. You okay? What are you thinking? I'm thinking you were right. I do deserve better than eating alone in hotel bars every night. And now you don't have to. Because of those book and TV deals? Exactly. And I know, the Stacy reading tonight wasn't ideal... but trust me, people are gonna forget about that in a month. There's still gonna be plenty of heat around Michael Vaughn. So what's your big plan? The plan is whatever you say it is. You're the boss. I don't make any moves without your blessing. The last time you promised that... I ended up with a knife to my throat. I am gonna regret that for the rest of my life. But think about this... you've got something now that can sink me for good. You own me, Chels, you call the shots. You have to deal with that first. Right, uh, look, I'll dump it somewhere on the edge of town. Then you can pick me up and we'll get out of here. All right. Get out. Chelsea and Michael... it's the way it's supposed to be. Police! Chelsea! You told them? What am I gonna do? What's gonna happen to me? You're Michael Vaughn. You'll think of something. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, god, thank god you're here! Michael killed that guy! I'll stay with her! Go after him, Danny! I thought he was gonna kill me, too! Did he hurt you? No, no, I'm okay. All right, I want to know as soon as you hear anything! You got him? I see him, he's right there! Right there! Right over there! Uh, remind me... what's your card again? Three of Clubs. Yo, how do you do that? I'm serious, bro, show me how you do that. I'd love to, but I can't.Quit bullshittin' me, bro. Teach me the fuckin' trick! Well, I can't teach you how to have magic, it's a gift. It's the thing that makes me special. Special? You feelin' special? If you're so fucking special... why don't you magic your ass out of this fuckin' place? Fuck boy. CHELSEA Honestly, it was a nightmare. The outpouring of support I received from people... was incredible, and that really helped the healing process. Hey, can you turn that back? Fuck you. Could you-- can you turn it back for one minute, please? I'm a kind of a professional skeptic, so just... after all of those years, you had no idea, not a clue... that Michael Vaughn was a fraud? I know it sounds crazy... but I truly thought he could talk to the spirit world. And if someone's convinced you of that... they can convince you of a lot of things. But for all the pain Michael's lies caused me... I have to believe it was all for a purpose. Crazy or not, it is a fascinating story, I must say. Now, folks, if you haven't picked up her New York Times... best-selling book, you have to read this. It is called "In League with - My Years Under...
