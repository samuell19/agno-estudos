(Tires squeal) (Echoing voices) (Gasps) (Police siren) Keep her down! Jack! Shut up! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jack... (Tires squeal) (Crash) They're getting closer. Jack! They're gonna shoot! Fuck! Are you hit? No! Fuck! Eight days earlier (Distant police siren) Jack, is it almost ready? Five minutes. Can I have a bite? Mm-hm. A taste? Mmm. Mm-hm. It's good. Yeah, well... Very, very good. Are you gonna cook it? Yeah. Yeah? Later. (Laughs) Ah! (Giggles) (Giggles) Yeah. Jack... Oh. Mmm. Good? Mmm. (Phone) That is so good. Hello? (Man) 'Maldonado here, who am I speaking to?' To whom are you talking? I don't know. Santa Claus? (Laughs) It's your monster. - 'Hello, Jorge.' - Your little boy's a bit touchy. It would be nice if you used his real name. Yes, and what is that? Jack. 'I've got a pick-up for Shrenger. 'Come by in the morning.' OK. Ciao. Bye. (Jack) I'll wait in the parking garage. Don't be long. So, things are good between you and, erm...? Jack. Jack, yes. Yes, things are very good. You know I've always wanted what's best for you, Sarah? I don't say this often enough but I'm really glad we're still friends. You know, maybe when I retire and Jack finds himself a woman of child-bearing age, maybe you and I can do some more traveling. I'm not into the romance anymore but, erm... I do miss the traveling. Jack doesn't want children. How sad. I'll buy you whatever you want. How about a young stud? Something for me to watch. Or maybe you'd prefer a girl? Oh, I've got this, erm, job coming up. A large piece. Shanghai to Brussels. Make you a lot of money. I can't. Fine. Jack and I are going to Majorca. Who the fuck goes to Majorca nowadays? I'll send you a postcard. Hi. Maldonado's such a creep. I wish I was free of him. He's such a sad fellow. He's an asshole. I won't be doing break-in shit at his age. He should be sad. (Sarah) Just wait here, OK? (Man) It's exquisite. Oh, I would hope so. I'll tell Jorge you're happy. You know, I don't know why we're all so enamored by Jorge. I mean, all this cloak-and-dagger drama bullshit, you know? It's just business. I told him to his face, he's an old drama queen. Listen, would you be open to a private arrangement? Just between us? Maybe. No more dramas, no middlemen. We both win. Oh, don't worry, it's not illegal. I mean, it's not a stolen piece. At least not for We've had our eye on it for almost a decade. Right, babe? We just want to be certain that it has a safe journey this weekend. That soon? Where? Munich. You come here first for payment. By the way, you and Jorge, do you have... an exclusive arrangement? Ah. Well, who cares? He'll never know, anyway. I can offer you half his fee. That's certainly more than you'll be paid as a courier. 50% up front. Your friend's at the door. What? Her friend is here. You invited a friend here? He's my partner. But not on this next trip. OK. Wow. This is a collection. You guys need a bigger place. Jack, this is Walter Shrenger. Jack Ganzer. Pleased to meet you. How do you do? And his wife Kumiko. So, Walter, this is... this is the object of your desire? (Chuckles) Babe, I think Sarah's friend would like a drink. - Whatever Sarah's having. - I think we should go. Really. Well then, we'll be in touch. Absolutely. Bye. Come again. I couldn't even stay for a drink? - It wasn't a genuine invitation. - What does that mean? It means Walter Shrenger doesn't want you for a friend. But he's a contact, Sarah. Walter would never invest in your restaurant. So why do you want to have a drink with him? I just didn't like being hustled out. It was fucking embarrassing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won't do that again. Day 3 Jack, I forgot to tell you, I'll be gone for a few days. OK. But only me this time. That's what he said. What? Who, Jorge or Walter said? I don't know. I didn't ask. The less questions I ask the better. What? This guy's a fucking scumbag. He knows you're safer with me. I know. So when are you leaving? Tomorrow. But when I get back we can go to Spain and have some fun. So where was I? Oh, yes, Juliana. We knew her husband. Poor woman thought she'd been left a fine collection. Instead he left her a mountain of debt and a truckload of crap. Except for the piece in question, which my wife covets. One hates to see a woman alone in desperate straits. So after the drop-off? When you and Juliana finish your transaction you will take the train directly back. No hotels, no cocktails, no shopping. You come right back here. Understand? Yes, I think I do. Day 4 (Cellphone) (Walter) 'Hello, Sarah?' Oui? - Yes, we just landed. - "We"? You didn't take your assistant? No, Jack's at home. I told him nothing, Walter. Good, good. I just don't want any complications. It's your money. Everything will be just as you wanted. All right? So I'll see you soon. Ciao. (American woman) Sorry, excuse me. I gave you, uh...more money? Bigger? More? More money? Non, non. - You gave me the wrong change. - Non, non, non. - Frere Jacques, I'm not stupid. - Vous m'avez donne 20 euros. I gave you a 20. Vous m'avez donne... What's he given you? ..20 euros et c'etait 9,50. Let me check. You're an American. Elle m'a donne 20 euros et je lui ai rendu 9,50 euros. - I gave him a 20 and I have change. - C'est combien? C'etait 9,50 euros, la monnaie. - These are four. I gave him... - That's right. That's right? Shit. Can I just, like, disappear? Conne. Did he just insult me? Probably. Come on. Au revoir. Merci, monsieur. Au revoir. They all look identical if you're not used to it. It's not even lunchtime and my day's already fucked. Where are you from? New York. You? LA, Hawaii and just round the corner. You just arrived in Paris? Yeah. - First time? - Yeah. I'm here for two months. Well, it's not a punishment. They're not all like him and it's not always like this. We should have coffee, do the ex-pat thing. Uh, yeah, but I'm waiting for a phone call. So... OK. Well... No, I have an hour, we... Now? I mean, I have a lunch date but... OK, got you. No, you know what? You should come. It's my boss but she's very cool. No, you go ahead. Go ahead. Have a nice day. All right. Well, thanks for sorting that out. No problem. Munich Juliana? I'm a friend of Walter and Kumiko's. So silly, a little piece of metal needs No offense. No. The government of origin doesn't feel that it's a silly and they will stop at nothing to get it and confiscate it. Oh, I meant no insult. We do what we have to do. Why else would I be sitting here? You have children? You are supporting a man who should be supporting you. Am I right? There are no "shoulds" in my life anymore. I hope your man is at least good to you. I mean, is he sweet? You ask too many questions, Juliana. He is my best friend. So was Wilhelm. Yes. I'm keeping you. No. I don't want to sell his things, they're all I've got but... I need groceries and shoes. You know, we women, we're the tough ones. We do what we have to do. Good luck. So thank you. I mean, merci. De rien. Hey. Hey. - The magazine thief. - It's the guy I told you about. Jack Ganzer. Oui. Americain? Enchante. Lisette Arcand. He speaks French. Un petit peu. C'est bien. Small world. I know, I was just... Yeah. Jenny, I have to get back but you take your time. Au revoir. Bye. Uh, did she just say Jenny? She did. Right. OK. That's my name. She seems really cool. Lisette is great. My mom met her on her junior year abroad and they kept in touch. She owns this really cool store. It's great, huh? I come here every week just to buy food. I spent six months picking things up and prodding them and sniffing them. It's what everybody does in this country. They know what they're doing. Except for those. You can get arrested for that. So why did you come here? I got thrown out. Thrown out? What did you do, kill somebody? You really wanna know? Me and some friends hacked into the school computer and changed our grades. Why? I think it had something to do with the fact that we never went to class and our grades sucked. OK. Yeah, so my parents thought, send her to France. She'll have an experience that she'll always treasure. Or something like that. What do you do? - I'm in the transport business. - (Sarah) 'Jack? Jack.' I wish you were there. I think about you all the time. I also wanted to tell you about this woman that I met. I wish you were there. Love you. Bye. - Hello? - Walter? Loose ends have been tied. 'Good. My wife will be very happy.' - 'Walter, how did he die?' - 'Who? Wilhelm, her husband? Well... - 'He shot himself, I think. Why?' - 'Oh.' No, I was just curious. I found her very interesting. My train arrives at 7am. Have a safe journey. Bye. Bye. Then you must know this guy - his store must be three I think I do. Does he usually wear a red hat and...? - Yeah. - He yells at people with dogs. He's not happy in his work. He's just angry. He's an angel. This is... This is my stop. I work here. You work here? - This is great. - Well, this was a cool coincidence. Yeah, it was. Stop by sometime. I'd love to. All right, take care. Bye. Oh, my. I've never seen one up close before. Philippe, put that away. But if you two will be alone, she needs to know. It's a little surgery, you'll be out in a few days. At least show her the drawer. She might have to close up if something happens. He's so dramatic. But you'll like this. That's so cool! And that's not all. - They're beautiful. - They're fakes. Only an expert can tell. We take the real ones out of the window at night and replace them with these. So we like to keep our window display visible at night. People wander by, full of wine, fall in love with the pieces and come back the next day with their credit cards. And just before you go, you set the code. You've 30 seconds to leave. Are you with me, cherie? Yes. Sorry. 30 seconds. Got it. Ah, oui, allo. Est-ce que Jenny travaille chez vous? Hi, Jenny, it's Jack. Boo. - Hey.

I'm so glad you called. * ..and we breathe * And we feel * We are here * We are real * And we breathe * And we feel (Inaudible over music) - (Song continues on car stereo) - How long have you been here? Cinq ans. And what did you say you do - transport? Uh-huh. What's that? Uh... A lot of driving. Different jobs, different people. I could tell you but it's so boring, you'd throw What? Are you bad?

Uh... - I assume you don't live here? - Not yet. - You have keys? - Well, in a manner of speaking... yes. (Clunk) All right. After you. Hold on. Oh, my. OK. Right. In answer to your question, this place is gonna be my restaurant. You own this place? I'm gonna. What do you think? Wow. Yeah. Yeah? Let me tell you about this place. It used to be a farm, it's 300 years old. In this room alone I could seat 40-50 people with some style. Upstairs more could stay. This place would run itself. - All I need is, like, a vision. - Concept. A sales pitch. Yeah. Precisely. So sell it to me. OK. The best of French meets the best of American. What do you think? I love it. Yeah. Really? Wanna see the rest? There's more? This thing, right, is a Zanussi. It's an oven. It's a Zanussi oven. I can cook with this for 30, 40, 50 people with one other guy. It'll last for 100 years, I'm not exaggerating. - I know it looks like a piece of crap. - It's bigger than my car. You know what these things are worth? It'll save me a fortune. So you came all the way over here to learn about this? No, wanna know why? Yes. Well... I used to be a car nut, right, and this guy heard about me and he wanted this rare old DeSoto. There's, like, three in the world. Some guys pay crazy money for cars so I found one and Special delivery, right? Special delivery as in stolen? As in I knew where to get one. Come on. You hungry?

Give me a call as soon as you get back. (Indistinct German announcements) (Screams) A friend of mine goes to CIA. What, are you going to turn me in now? No, the Culinary Institute of America. It's the best school. Schools are pointless. You'll learn more here in a week than you would So how come ten days here feels like forever? I don't know. I guess you pick it up bit by bit. That first week, you know nothing. Then, you get to know your street, then your area. Suddenly, it's home. You make it sound so easy. No, I don't think it's easy. You can't do it on your own. Good thing I met you then. Yeah, I guess it is. So are you coming up? Not tonight. You're not, uh... involved, are you? No, no, no. Oh. Well, good night. (Beep) 'Vous avez deux messages.' 'Jack?

(Distant sirens) (Sighs) Regarde, your friend is here. Can I help you, sir? Uh... Looking for a gift for your wife or girlfriend but you're not sure what she would like? Or perhaps you've met someone new. Jenny, uh... I could show you our selection, perhaps make Something like this, for example. These were made by a Chinese artist and there's a story Once upon a time, there was a man who was in love He used to go to visit her every day. Only one day he arrived, only to find her tangled in a fisherman's net. He dove in but the harder he tried to save her the more tangled they became and the sea swallowed them up. How sad is that? Do you want me to buy these for you? No, I just like the story. I don't need anything. Listen, I was wondering if, uh, you weren't doing anything, if you wanted to come round, I could cook. Sure. I'd love to. OK. (Knock on door) Hello? Hi. Hi. Come in. Thank you. Very French. Sure. Wow. You like? - You live in a museum. - I live in Paris. It's the same thing. - Can I take your coat? - All right but I want it back. Nice curtains. I can't take credit for those. I have a roommate. We're alone now. A girl? Uh-huh. I can tell. There's a nice kind of female energy - Would you like a glass of wine? - Sure. So, how long have you guys been friends? I don't know, a few years. She took me in when I arrived. And then never quite managed to get rid of me, I suppose. So here I am. Thank you. Paris Car Rental Depot (Phone) Thank you. You're welcome. Jack? No, not Jack, Sarah.

That's to be delivered to Shrenger in exchange for 80,000. That's 50,000 for the piece. 30,000 is my commission. Your cut is fuck all. A real heartbreaker to me, Sarah. He's already paid for it once. He won't pay for it again. You'll have to deal with him. I'm sorry. I don't have eighty thousand dollars. I don't have anything. Why don't you reason with him, cook him lunch or fucking I don't give a shit! Actually he's a bit tetchy at the moment. An old friend of his - a really dear old friend - died tragically. And that used to belong to her, coincidentally. You don't have to do this. Do you worry about how much I know about you? Not really, no. You? I'll give this to Shrenger and I'll owe you. After all these years, that must mean something to you. Well, you're resourceful. - Your boyfriend's resourceful. - Fuck you. Look, I don't mean to threaten you... Actually I fucking do! Now, your Jack is as culpable as you. You know why? - Fuck you! - It's your fucking fault, Sarah! Yes! You became a unit and it would really be cruel to break that unit up! You know what? I can really taste you. Oh, God. Jack! (Moans) (Jenny) Mmm. I'll be right back. Hey, don't be long. Oh, I'm sorry. He told me you were roommates. Yeah, we are. Roommates. Sorry. You're a fucking liar. (Door slams) (Heavy footsteps) (Jack) Jenny. Jenny, for Christ's sake, where are you going? Move! How was the job, Sarah? Perhaps you could tell me what because Jorge rang and said something about fucking and So maybe you could give me an explanation. Are you seriously questioning me? Who was that? That is a girl who works here in a jewelry... What does it matter? Where were you? Is there a collar around your neck, Jack? See a leash anywhere? You're either here because you want to be here with me or not. Sarah... Fuck you. Day 6 Jack? Jack? (Jack) Jenny. Jenny, hold on a second. Can I talk to you? Just get away from me! Just get away! - Let me try to explain to you. - Explain what? You took me to your house! Where you live. With her! - I didn't know she'd come back. - Quit while you're ahead. I can't! Please! Get over it! - Let me say what I have to say. - Fine. I was wrong. Of course I was wrong. But I don't want you to think I lied to you deliberately or I set you up to deceive you. When I met you, it was just impossible for me to turn Please... You should have seen her face. I'm leaving her, Jenny. Why? Because with her it's like it's her life. It's not my life. Her life? Which means it's her money. - It's more complicated than that. - What a fucking loser. You don't understand. I know more than you! Please. (Sobs) Please. It's all right. I hate you so much. I hate you so much. (Doorbell) (Both) Bonjour! Bonjour. Um, je suis une amie de votre papa. (Girl) Papa, Papa, il y a une amie! (Sarah) Hello. Hello. Agnes, this is Sarah. Enchantee.

I need $80,000. Where would I...? Why would I give you anything? We're not married anymore, Sarah. I understand. I owe you so much and I have so many things to apologize for. And I don't know where to start. No longer necessary. It's my daughter's birthday, so... Gerard, I am desperate. I don't have anybody to go to except for you. Sarah, my family is waiting. OK. Your family. I think Paul has your restlessness. How is he? He's fine. Will you give him my love? (Phone) Oui? Yes, Jorge. Is it just me or is Walter becoming a worrier? Anyway, he's called. He's anxious for the coin. 'Sorted out your finances?' Not yet. Well, I know you went to see Gerard. I'm assuming that Have you tried Paul? You leave Paul out of this. Two days. That's your time frame. All I'm saying is that you've got lots of options I wish you were dead! I know. I just got carried away with the whole love at first sight thing. What was I thinking? You didn't get carried away. You promise? Yeah, I promise. You're going to say it's because I'm away and everything's new but... What? Come on, say it. I love you. Day 7 (Chuckles) - What are you gonna do all day? - I don't know. Get my stuff. Maybe find a place to live. Really? Uh-huh. I'll find somewhere. Where? I don't know. A hotel. Have you got a coffee pot? Do you have any money? I'll buy us a coffee pot today. I'm serious. What? I'm sorry. What was the question? She was keeping you, wasn't she? No. No. It's OK. I can help. I just need to know what you need. I don't need anything except some fucking coffee. When I met her I had nothing. I mean zero. She rented me a room for 25 francs a month, as a friend. - Why didn't you just steal a car? - Because I didn't want to! - I don't want to steal anything. - I'm sorry. So she was just helping you out. Yes. And then, one night things happened and... You say you're not going to own each other but time passes and all of a sudden you're attached and it's not cos you chose it. It just happened when you weren't thinking about it. Now you can choose. You can stay here. You know that, right? I don't know. Stay with me. Why? So you can keep me too? Don't be an asshole. Father said you'd been to see him. Yes, I did. I saw your picture there. Just let me look at you, Paul. You're so handsome. Are you in some kind of trouble again? No. Why are you lying? Just tell me how much money you need then. I don't. I don't want your money. It's been so long. I miss you so much. Don't you understand? I don't want to hear you're dead. Paul, nothing is going to happen to me. I'm not gonna be dead. Jack, this is Paul. Paul, this is Jack. Last chance, Sarah. I won't offer again. Last chance? What have you got to offer her? - Is this the guy you live with? - Yes. - What the fuck's it got to do with you? - If you give a shit, - Oh, please get out. - Hey! Hey! Stop it, Jack! Damn it! Stop it, Jack! Sorry. I'm sorry. It shouldn't have been like this. I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. Goodbye, Sarah. Paul is my son. (Sobs) Son, huh? That's one I didn't see coming. (Moans) What happened to your neck? Did you get that in Majorca? I didn't go to Majorca. I did a job for Shrenger and Maldonado found out and He's a sick animal and I'm so scared, Jack, because he took the money and he took the coin. And now I have to come up with $80,000 by myself. (Sighs) (Sighs) You make me crazy. You make my life a whole bed of roses too. You and your secrets. I wanted to tell you. I'm always trying to save you. And you don't... you don't even want to be saved. Yes, I do. What's he really going to do if you don't pay him? He's already killed one person. So I'll go with you. We'll meet him, make a deal. He doesn't make deals. He wants 80,000 in two days. How quickly can you sell the apartment... Maldonado owns the apartment. Uh-huh. How are you and her? Complicated. It's not complicated. Men always want something new. It's very simple. Are you in love with her? Look, Sarah... Are you? Are you in love with her? I met the girl three days ago. Then think about it. About what? Don't make me spell it out. Do you have any idea what you're asking? She wouldn't get hurt. How does she not get hurt? It's not her store. I mean, she wouldn't even have to know. Day 8 (Jenny) Here we go. OK. OK. - Why don't you look? - I don't know. I'm just trusting you. You should. Don't you trust me? More and more by the second. OK, whoa. All right, that's just the chair, don't worry. Step to your left. OK, sit. There you go. All right. Open. - Oh, God. That's very sweet of you. - (Laughs) Now you can have your fucking cup of coffee. I had some keys made today. We can pick them up tomorrow. - What do you say we go out to eat? - Now? Uh-huh. What are you thinking about? Hey? What are you thinking about? Nothing. I have night privileges. (Jenny shrieks, car horn blares) Wanna see something neat? Yes. What the hell is that? Pretty neat, huh? It's the real stuff. We switch them round at night, takes forever. I care about you too. You know that, right? Of course I know that. Everything's fine. Are you OK? No, no, everything is fine. I'll tell you tomorrow. As soon as she goes to work... Go back to sleep now. Yeah. I know. I know. OK, bye. Hey. Wait, I'll make coffee. Go back to sleep. Really? Yeah, bye. So, there's two compartments, right? - The place we need to worry about... - Slow down. ..is the table, which has a drawer where they're Look at me. Say it now. This is the time, OK? Cos there's no turning back after tonight. Yeah, it's tonight. So, we'll keep enough for ourselves to go away? Where shall we go? Er, maybe... Florence? Do you want to go to Florence? - I don't know if I can do that, Sarah. - OK. - I was thinking about sticking around. - That's really clever. We rob a store, stick around and we get arrested? No. No, we rob the jewelry store, we get you out of trouble I don't think... You don't think what? I don't know if I can give her up. And the police will never think to question And she'll never remember entering the alarm code while - It'll seem like some silly coincidence? - Don't make me walk away. You know, I will do this for you because I love you. Jenny. - Sure you're all right closing up tonight? - Yeah, fine. Are you OK, cherie? You were quiet today. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye. Oh, fuck. Jack? I know you're in here. Jack? Did you plan this from the beginning? She tells you what to do. Who to fuck. What a fucking idiot I am! You've got it all wrong. How is it then? How is it? Jenny, this place has to be insured, it's not going What about me? I'm supposed to come to work tomorrow and pretend nothing happened? Why not? I had no choice. She's in trouble. They're gonna kill her. Fuck her. Are you looking for this? What are you doing? She pushed the fucking panic button, didn't you? Didn't you? Damn it. Don't let her do this. - Get in the car. Get in the fucking car. - OK, OK! Come on. Will you keep her down? Jack! Just stay down. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Sirens blaring) (Car horn) - How many can you see? - Er, two... No, three. There's three. (Sirens) Oh, God. No! (Horn blasts) Please stop the car. Fuck! Shut up! Stop the car! Come on, Jack. (Jenny) Stop the car. Stop the car. They're getting closer. Jack! He's got a gun, they're gonna shoot! (Gunshots) Jesus Christ! Are you hit? Are you hit? No! No. (Gunshot) Fuck! (Screams) (Tires squeal) Jack! (Screams) (Sobs) (Sobbing) (Sniffs) (Sobbing) Oh, Jack. Jack. Jack. Make your choice. Make your choice. Make your choice. I'm... I'm so sorry. It's all for nothing, you know. (Whimpers) Mademoiselle, s'il vous plait. Vous ne pouvez pas rentrer. - Je travaille ici. - Non. Vous ne pouvez pas rentrer. - I work here. I work here. - Bon, allez, d'accord. Allez-y. C'est bon, c'est bon. Lisette? Jenny. What's happened? The shop's been robbed. Oh, my God. You're late. This better be worth my while, Sarah. It's worth your while. I can't get you as much as you want, you know. I mean, what a mess - three dead cops. Pathetic. They want the coin. Walter, why don't you come and get it yourself? Fucking fakes! Sarah! The deal's off! Please. Please... Hey! (Gunshots continue) (Walter) So much needless pain, for everyone. Well, the thieves certainly knew everything. That you switched the jewels at night. - Who else knew, besides you two? - Just my husband. Could you have mentioned it to someone else? Not that I know of. Jenny? No. Oh, my God. What's wrong? What is it? I think, when I was closing up last night, I forgot to Oh, Jenny. I forgot. (Echoing voices)
