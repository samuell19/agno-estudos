THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY... FRENCH WEST INDIES - 1964 My God. How French you are! Prime Minister Michel Debré announced today, at the end of the Council of Ministers, the creation of BUMIDOM, the Bureau for the Development of Migration in France's overseas territories. Continental France will be welcoming its citizens from Martinique, Guadeloupe and Réunion. When I got on the plane, I was like: "Why did I leave? Why am I leaving?" So many questions. So much to think about. I'm feeling so lost. We were told we'd get training and a job. We said "okay." We were told: "You'll learn to do housework." That hit me hard. I was like: "I can't believe it. I didn't fly 7.000 kilometers to do housework." I would've paid good money to fly back. But I realized it wasn't possible, because it was a one-way plane ticket. There were no return flights. WE SHALL OVERCOME BUMIDOM DOWN WITH THE SLAVE TRADE WHITE BASTARDS DOWN WITH FRENCH IMPERIALISM SET THE WEST INDIES FREE DOWN WITH COLONIALISM WE WANT TO GO HOME NO TO THE BUMIDOM BASED ON THE NOVEL "LE GANG DES ANTILLAIS" BY LOÏC LERY My dad was an old, angry nigga. I never saw him laugh. His face was just mystery and severity. When he'd lacerate my back with his belt, I'd dream about his death. But I did love him. He died three days before I left. My heart was grieving when I landed in Paris. I was 13. He'd tell me: "If you don't find your place in society, you'll never find it in your own family." All my life, I've had to fight. What the hell are you doing here? Get out of here! Odile, wake up. Come on, move it! Move it! I got things to do! Come on, let's go. Don't come back. Don't touch me. I was tired of looking for low-paying jobs. When I'd come in for an interview, &lrm;they'd tell me &lrm;the position had been filled. Some bosses were more straightforward: "We don't hire niggas." Odile, your smile kept me going since your mom had left us. Hi, boss. You can wash up, the john's clean. Thanks. Where are we gonna sleep? Don't worry. We'll find something. Daddy's on it. I have stuff to do this morning. You're staying with Godmother. Hello, sir. -It's done. -Goodbye, sir. No... It's for the province. Don't yell. Don't be afraid! We're just here to fill up our tattered pockets. We can make this an enjoyable experience. Come on. Do what you're told, and it'll be over quick. Don't move and you'll be fine, okay? Give us the money. Hurry up. -Leggo! -Wait. BUMIDOM TREASON Politik, my ghetto brother, introduced me to Liko, Paris's most cunning postman, and Molokoy, the King of Barbès. How much? 20,000. You good? Pays better than your hospital shifts. They were looking for a fourth guy for a special job. I said yes right away. To Jimmy who joined our cause! He's done with that broom! I had nothing to lose. You worked like a chief. It works better as a quartet. Did that brunette get moist, being held by a nigga? If you let 'em in, you deal with them. You got scared, huh? Shouldn't we be wearing masks? No, the message is we got nothing to lose. To a white guy, all niggas look alike. When's the next one? Guys, I know a post-office that's really cool. The riot police will be nearby, but it's not their job to intervene, they'll call the regular cops. No one will see us from outside. It's a goldmine, let's help ourselves. Hold on. Isn't three in a week a bit much? Why wait? You think the State is waiting to screw us? BUMIDOM, BUMIDOM, BUMIDOM... Fuck their mamas. How long have you been at the mail sorting center? Ten years at Gare du Nord. From 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The BUMIDOM promised me a regular job. It worked out. You? My mom sent me to France. Tensions with my old man. -All right. -Okay, see you later. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm coming! Do you have papers? They hand 'em out like lottery tickets. Molokoy sent me. 150 francs a week. You pay in advance. We'll have a new room. -With a real bed? -Yeah. So... Gimme room number two. No, number five, number five. -Do you smoke? -No. Good. The shitter's in the hallway. Will you come back next week? There you go. -Is it okay? -Yeah. If you need another bed, it's five francs per day. Okay. Oh, God! Let me do it. If she's too noisy, you're outta here. This ain't no nursery. Are you coming, Pops? Yeah. I was working as a stretcher-bearer when I met Linda. Her creole beauty stunned me. She had no problems accepting Odile. It seemed obvious to her. Her dream was to make it big in music. I admired her perseverance. Her voice made my heart melt. You scared me. You're so handsome. My little flower. No, not here. I don't want any trouble. Let me see this. No, Jimmy. I'm not done with my shift. No. I don't have the time for this. I'll be done in two hours. A Gibson? Is it for me? But how? It's not stolen, is it? I bought it for you. It's your dream guitar, right? Thanks. Need anything else for Odile? No. I don't need to beg anymore. Politik found me a construction job. Construction? With Politik? Oh, and Godmother's back hurts. Can you check on her? I will. I also got some news for you. I got an audition at the Monico. That's great! No. Not here. Not here, Jimmy. Go ahead. Tell me. One, two... -Yeah... -Three, four and five. Okay. You got it. Write it down. Linda told me you found work? Good for you. You can get a real apartment. It'll be better for school and all... Don't you forget to ask them for a pay stub every month. Odile, come and drink your hot chocolate. Gimme that notebook. -Do you remember Nicole? -No. Her folks had a big apartment rue des cascades. Brown hair. You didn't like going there when I cleaned homes. So I let you stay at the library. You were off the street, couldn't misbehave. Why are you telling me this? She dropped by. Asked me how you were doing. She saw you at a post-office recently. Oh yeah? What does she look like? Long hair, in her forties. Been walking with a limp since she had her accident. And when was that? How would I know? I told her that you never tell me much. Gotta go. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. No, Jimmy, stay. Jimmy... You just got here. Sit down. Jimmy! Fuck you! You didn't recognize her? I was 13. How do you plan to handle this? -She's a friend of Godmother's... -Fuck... How do you know she won't talk? She told her. She wants something. You need to fix this. It's yours now. Come in, Jimmy. I used to know all these books. They smelled of Catholic school and a good education. I no longer wanted their help and their pity. I was done shutting up and breaking my back. Remember how my mom would give all of my books to Godmother, for you? No. -You know, she liked you. -I don't live in the past. -What about your future? -None of your business. I'm not here to judge you. I'd like to help you. I don't need shit. Godmother's in trouble because of you. I didn't tell her anything. Better keep your mouth shut. I ain't alone. I know where you're from. My folks met Godmother when she just got here. They helped her. By letting her clean the shitter? -Housework. -Same difference. You don't know shit. Too much talking! I ain't the boy I used to be. Shut the hell up and don't get involved. Trésor did stop it. It wasn't with his hand, it was his arm. It's accidental. But the ref missed it! The Argentines jumped him like a pack of hyenas. No whistle! Ladies and gents! Hello. Nobody cares about the rules anyway! The refs are on our side for once. I won't complain. That's for sure. A john stole my handbag last night. I got no money. Here you go. That one's on me. Thanks. That's sweet. Pay me back tomorrow. What about you guys? -The usual. -Thanks. So there's a new scare, huh? Can't buy stamps without getting jacked? We can't put a cop in front of every post-office. Don't worry, we'll catch these baboons. Just give us some time. Yeah. Come on, let's go. Yup. -Put it on my tab. -Yeah. See you later. Hello. -So? -Didn't need to hurt her. She won't talk. She's single. Her husband died in a car accident a while ago. She doesn't have a man. I hope you're right... Crackers hate brothers, except as cleaning staff. Do you trust white people? You can't trust them, brother! They never honored their word. Wanna hear about how they plundered Africa? No, I'm good. I just need a pair of Westons! Crocodile boots, huh. In a suit, nobody will notice you. You're no longer black, you're invisible! Hey, guys. You know what they're saying? Our gang stole millions of Francs. Bastards! That's way more than what we ever stole from them! Jimmy's right. Too small. Then get a haircut. Can't see shit. It'll get hot in there... No, no, no, it's fine. We never run! It's the best way to get spotted! We'll get a cab. -A cab? -Yeah, a cab... And we come back here in pairs. No need to rush, okay? -Are you being serious? -Yeah, I'm serious. You go ahead of us. We'll meet at 8:30. Come on. Let's go. These balaclavas are a dumb idea! Politik's been listening to Jimmy. Are you jealous, or what? We already did a dozen heists with no problems. Makes sense to try and be cautious. The cops have absolutely no leads yet. We were doing fine without him, right? The white lady was his fault! Why would Politik listen to him? So you don't trust him? Jimmy's a weakling. Yeah, right! You'd rather have his slice of the pie! We're a team now, this is what we do! If we shoot ourselves in the foot, we're fucked! Okay? Come on. This is the great Tchieko. My hands are dirty. So are mine, son. All right, man. Will you have a drink with us? No, I'm good, brother... Them pigs keep messing with me... They just hate our kind... Peyrefitte, the so-called Minister of Justice, wants to kill some leftists. Watch your backs, guys. Don't worry. We're not on file... You know what the life of a black guy in prison is worth? Less than nothing! Mirval, a brother from the West Indies... Three puppets wearing caps... They beat him to death! These motherfuckers! His mom's still fighting to get France to admit to this hate crime. Whether or not you're on file, they don't give a fuck. Why did he go to jail? 57 francs. 57 francs? Stolen from a ticket dispenser... They always treat us like shit. Acting like thugs won't get you anywhere. France led us to believe there was room for us here. They lied to us. We're just getting our money back. The whole system needs to be changed. What needs to be changed? I spent ten years in the unions, demonstrating... It's a load of bull! Look at Cuba. It works. Corsica too! They're ready to help us. Can't you join our brothers who are fighting for our people? Tell them we support them. You! When you're learning to swim, don't jump into the deep end! Don't you feel like he just jacked us? Oh, no, no. It goes to our brothers, for their fight. They need guns. Who is he? A former armed robber. Showed me the ropes. He got locked up, got nailed by Broussard. Respect! My laundry? Where's my laundry? A young man was here. He had a bag... Stay close to your washing machine, ma'am. Lots of robbers around here! Now that I'd gained some experience, I felt like a minimum-wage robber. We'd done a dozen post-offices. During the heists, I was no longer France's house nigga. I no longer needed France to lend me a hand. I wanted to rip off the entire arm. I was getting ambitious. Give us the dough or she comes with us! Can't do. She's staying with me. You should be ashamed of yourself, you nigga-fucking slut! I'll pay you! Don't cause any trouble around here! I'm taking the whore! Got it? Come with me! -Stop. -Come here, bitch. Come here. -Take her. -You finished your stash, huh? -You knew I was gonna come back! -Let her go! I'm warning you! If I come back, I'll beat the shit outta you! Don't do anything stupid, Jimmy! Now you know my name. You never come back here. Get up. Shut up. Back to your room! I can't let them have Samia. I taught her everything. Why should I let her go? Jimmy? Jimmy! Wake up. Wake up, Jimmy! Wake up! Jimmy! Are you fucking kidding me! I don't want to live with a bank robber. You'd rather live with a hobo? Why don't you get a job like normal people do, huh? You think I like wiping my patients' asses? You'll end up in prison! I'm too clever for that! This isn't a good place for you, Jimmy. Come and live with me... My mom kicked me out, as did Godmother. What the hell would I do at your place? I'm fine here. What's wrong? Huh? What is it? The audition? You'll find something else... No, Jimmy. That's how it is. They don't give a fuck about my feelings. I'll never make it. -I'll focus on becoming a nurse. -You can't give up. It's useless. I'll never make it. I believe in you. You'll get there. I don't have your courage, Jimmy. I don't have your strength. Pops? Pops! I'm sorry. I gotta go. I've always thought that the Parisian life Was only Pigalle and Barbès I was so disappointed when I got there Although I did have a nice flight I enjoyed the movie theaters I ate well, drank well I slept well and I woke up I'd only speak French I'd only speak French But when I got to Paris... So, Liko, you can finally escape that shithole? I'm sending everything back home... Pretty soon, I'll be richer than you all! Why are you saying this? So? Did you double-check? We got equal shares? What's your problem? Why do you insist on screwing us? You're the one who got that cracker lady involved! Jimmy, what's the matter? Check his jacket! He's stealing from us! Go ahead. Empty your pockets. Empty your pockets! You ain't feeling my pockets, motherfucker! Oh, yeah? Jimmy! I'll handle this. You fucking lowlife. You piece of shit! Shut the fuck up and sit down. -Scamming your own brothers... -Liko... -Shut op! -But... -You got no shame? -Hey! You think I hadn't noticed? What Molokoy stole, he stole from Capitalism. It ain't my money, and it sure ain't yours! And you, if you start believing the money's yours, then I'm very worried about you! Our brother Molokoy can steal the money, but remember, we chop the hand of those who steal... Now it's your turn to take care of the lady. Shake hands. Jimmy, you need to go now. I'll show you the way. I'm worried, Nicole... He says he works construction, but he walks around in fancy suits! Where did he get all that money? I hope he's not in that gang, the one that robs post offices... You would've told me, huh? No, but... What are you talking about? You know, I've decided to sell Antoine's violins. I need to move on. Did he come here to see you? No, why? Godmother had been plucked out of her home by the BUMIDOM. Her life of servitude had broken her back. No husband, no kids. There was no escape from her maid's room. She didn't want me to squander my opportunity. She believed that if I stayed on track, I'd become somebody. She had no time for my need to revolt. Are you telling me the truth, Nicole? I am... Is it Molokoy who sent you? Stop. This won't be necessary. Stop it. I told you you don't need to do this. You're coming with us. Just follow us and don't make a fuss. Fuck you! What did you expect? I'll just get in your trunk so you can bury me somewhere? Come with us or else we do this now, okay? Slowly. Slowly. Keep walking. Keep walking! Don't move... Let's go. Where are you taking him? I won't hesitate to pull the trigger... It'll remind me of the good old days. Does Ghardaïa ring a bell? Huh? We used to shoot fellagha like you for target practice. Shoot him! A colonialist? We should've slit all of you guys' throats. If de Gaulle hadn't left us, we would've kicked your asses big time. The FLN won the war, you swine! Do it! Yeah, France to the French, Algeria to the Arabs... This is my home. Jimmy, take the keys and go around the back. Get the fuck out here. All right. Let's go. Fuck you. Hey guys, it came out yesterday! Galaxy... Les Aiglons. Ah, Liko, you're here. Henri Debs. Georges Plonquitte! It's gonna be my last heist. I've been dreaming of opening a Jamaican Ital restaurant on a beach.. I have enough money now. Goodbye, cold! I'm going home. Liko... You can't do this to us, Liko. Who will tell us what post offices are easy targets? We really have a trust issue, guys. Trust is gone. It's time for me to go. Take your time to think about it. I have no wish to become the slave of guns. I'm done. I'm out of here. Liko! You should do the same. Look! Look at what they did to her. It's your fault. I told you not to humiliate that asshole. She used to be able to choose her clients. She ain't worth shit now. Fuck! What am I gonna do with her? What you should've done a long time ago: send her home! Go home. You're just a kid! Don't you have better things to do? Look at us. Look at us, Samia. You don't belong in this dump. Is that what you want? War? It wasn't me. They started it. They tried to kidnap him. You want to pick a fight with the Arabs? Don't you see that's exactly what the cops want? They'll just count the bodies. The Arabs are just like us, they'll do anything to survive. No fighting. Pay them back or give 'em that girl back. When France sent us to fight in Algeria, what would you have done? Huh? Would you have fired at those men who were fighting for the right to live in their homeland? Colonized people vs colonized people. I got no beef with the Arabs. Look at you. You'd be ready to crawl on all fours for your heroin fix. You're a wreck. -Fuck you! -Get out! Get out! I don't want you around. You're fired. You happy now? Got what you wanted? What I saw in Molokoy's gaze frightened me. Hatred and despair. But he was all talk and no walk. He'd never dare to fight back. But he hated my guts. I had to take some precautions. Are you outta your mind? After what they tried to do to me, and what they did to the girl, I'm not taking any risks. Hide it in the back of your pants, boy. We need someone else. Tchieko? No, not Tchieko. He's retired for good. Linda came to pick up the kid. We need to talk. Come here, Jimmy. What's going on, Jimmy? I'm worried about you... -I'm not doing anything wrong. -Liar! You're in that gang! You've stolen millions of francs! Do you have no shame? We only take the crumbs. You'll end up in prison, Jimmy! Was it Nicole who told you? -No. -So who was it? Linda? No! Do you think I'm an idiot! I see this with my own eyes. What will you tell Odile? -Leave her out of this. -That her dad is a thief? Jimmy. This will end badly. Get out while you still can... -There are other ways to earn money. -Not here. So this is what you want? Money, money, and more money! You've all lost your minds. Nice cars, nice clothes, the easy life... Is that what you want? Is that it? An easy life? Is that what you want? An easy life? An easy life? My life has never been easy. So don't you raise your finger on me! The only thing I got for free were my dad's whippings. Don't you ever raise a finger on me. Are you the one who talked to her? She's clever enough to figure it out... You know you've become a problem? Can't you go away, disappear for a while? My life is here. You're the one who has a choice. I won't leave. Too bad. I've warned you... Are you sure it's a good time to go back? I need to make sure Odile is safe. She has nothing to do with all this. For the gang, I got someone. An ex-boxer, Jackson. What does he do now? He used to be a middle-weight. He was a regional champ. He got tired of getting KO'd. He gave up. We'll see him when I get back. Don't you want to come with me? What for? To see a grave? It was when I was broke that I wanted to see my mom. Now, I don't have anyone. Don't you want to see the guys from the gang? That's not what they call themselves now. But they're still fighting for independence. I'll give you something for them. When I arrived in France, I never talked. I was afraid people would make fun of my accent. I did my best to forget about my former life. The heat, the smells... the sound of waves... My mother wanted me to become a civil servant. My teachers used to say it was possible, with a bit of discipline. It's probably the reason they sent me to the continent, but once there, I ditched school. For our generation, public service, with its offices, its bossy middle managers, was a real nightmare. I could get it fixed. Or buy new ones. Soon, there won't be any fishermen or even fishes left. Even back in your father's day, it wasn't a good job. And he'd spend all his money on those cock fights... -What did you do with the roosters? -I sold them. Jimmy, you shouldn't have come back. You're the one who sent me away. You and your dad scared me. You were like two roosters. Stop it, Mom. He was just a drunk who beat his children. Gotta face up to reality. He's suffered. Sorry, Jimmy... I didn't know it would be so difficult for you. As for Odile, I'll be back soon for her. I'm glad she's here with me. Look! It's for a necklace. Wow! I like it. Are we gonna stay here, Dad? Do you like it here? You know I love you, but you can't stay with me... You're gonna stay here with Mammy Dèle. She'll take care of you, and I'll be back soon. I'm not gonna abandon you. I promise. You're the most precious thing I got. Blow by blow, you learn I heard there's a child underneath There's a scared kid hiding In my adult tantrums &lrm;I think my mom hates me &lrm;I'm her spitting image I strayed to the left of the right path To talk to an angel &lrm;I remember my father saying "I love you" &lrm;With his knuckles Are you okay? Are you okay, sir? Here you go. Thanks. It's All Saints Day. Do you want me to paint it over? No, thanks. Bam! I was sent here by Politik. -Are you Jimmy? -Yeah. Go get a chair. -Have you eaten? -No. Go get a plate. -I'll pass. -Pass. I added a few more for the brothers. Come tomorrow with Timalo, I have a rifle for you. I need to get rid of it. They'll soon raze everything down. No more sheet metal shacks. Just concrete cages. Domino. Politik had comrades who were fighting for independence. Their numbers were low, but they were making enough noise that people at the very top had noticed. I'll introduce you. Nankin. Rainette, this is Jimmy, Politik's comrade. You've arrived in the Caribbean's last colony. Even Saint Lucia is independent. They were right to keep their head up. They didn't want France to keep our islands on a leash. The colonial system was still there. When is Politik coming back? We need people like you. Enough talk. We need action. It's the same thing over there. Our best defense is offense. France's official policy was to get you to leave. Both you and Politik. To stop us from fighting, to divide us... Why don't you guys come back? To the airport. There was my promise to Odile. And all the stuff I felt when I was back. Liko was right. I would come back and settle here when it would be all over. We're good. The cops are gone. I'm so happy. It worked out great. Jackson had eventually joined us. His boxer's physique helped us on many occasions. He looked a bit like Battling Siki. When I bumped into him again, he was a strip club bouncer. As kids, we'd often play cops and robbers. We went to the same school. I was twice as strong as him. I'd beat him up bad, but he'd always get back up. He ended up earning respect from everyone. Yeah. I tried boxing, but it wasn't for me. This guy actually won a few fights. I think we have a deal. See? I told you. What about airport security? It went through like a breeze. Okay. Hey! What the hell is going on? -It went great. -We'll do great work together. -Let's get going. -Rue Jean Moulin, please. Put it away! It wasn't me! So what? Does it even matter? Did you see the state she's in? She'll suffer permanent damage! I wasn't involved. I promise. You can try and hide from it-- Hey! I never hid from anything. So it's all about the money! Look around! There are people who survive by relying on what life gives them. That's their business... I see. You don't need me. Let's go home. I'll never go back to that crappy dump! It's just like you. Stop acting out. You can't do this. Can't do this here... I stopped doing music, I applied to that fucking nursing school! Do you think I enjoy that? Are you able to have kids and settle down? Would you be able to do that, Jimmy? It's over with Politik. Do you have a problem? No, no, no. Everything's fine. -Oh! -We've met before, right? No. Oh, yeah? Are you sure, Snow White? Watch your mouth when you're talking to me! Oh, why don't you shut your stupid nigga mouth -and do what you're told? -ID? -Are you armed? -We're French, sir. We're French! We were born in Martinique and Guadeloupe. -Hey! Calm down. -Stay here! Come on, turn around! Stay calm. Don't move. Turn around. She's clean. Here are your papers. Here you go. Have a nice day. For fuck's sake, I shut up because of you. I should've killed 'em both. And what next? Jimmy... Jimmy! Why did you let him do that? It's completely crazy, now she has a reason to rat on us. You told him to do it, huh? I'm gonna beat him so bad... For real, did you see the state she's in? He's mentally ill! He's mentally ill! You won't do a thing, Jimmy. You'd agreed on the means, right? Not on sending her to the hospital clinging for life. There's no perfect method. You got to respond to violence with violence... Burn their houses, make them live in terror... When I first met Politik, I knew our lives would be intertwined. I've shared everything with him, moments of weakness and moments of joy. It hurt that we had to part like this. But how can you not hold a grudge when a bro from the ghetto throws you under the bus? -Get out. They're waiting. -How many are there? -Where the fuck is he? -No idea! Where the hell did that nigga go! -Find him! -What are we doing? Look for him! He's over there! Over there! What the hell is going on? Oh, shit... Get out of here. Quick! Careful. Jimmy? Jimmy? Hey, Jimmy? Jimmy! You know the cops are stumped, right? In this article, your gun turned into a sub-machine gun. Since they offed Mesrine, they've been looking for a new public enemy. The position's up for grabs! You know what I dream about? I dunno... about fucking Giscard's wife? About a big heist... worth several million francs, so I can leave this shithole. We can't hit post-offices anymore. They'll call the cops every time a nigga wants to buy stamps. I thought it was over. I have a deal for you. I'm listening. For our final heist, we hit a bank. We hit the jackpot and then bye-bye. The Banque de France? I'm very serious. It's a local branch. It's a job for professionals. You can't improvise. You need intel, scouting... I did clean it up one summer. I know the place in and out. I trust Jimmy. Let's check it out now. It's small. Three or four workers, tops. One guard. The teller's behind his window, but there are no automatic doors. Sit down. You too. An armed guard. You know what that means? Won't be holding the door for us! I can handle him. Three people won't be enough. Not Molokoy. No. I'll handle him. If he's clean, he'll do. We need someone to guard the door. It's my last offer. Okay, no problem. On our way out, we'll go down this street. Is there a camera? Yeah, I'll just bust it with my gun. Is it doable? Yeah. What are you gonna do with the dough? I don't know. Cuba... Cuba! Hasta siempre. La revolución. These dudes know what a real revolution looks like. I'm getting out of the game. I want to lead an honest life. What about Molokoy? He's at my place. I'm forcing him to stay sober. He'll be ready. How much is there? I don't know, 100, 150 thousand. I hope the guard will get back on his feet. You hit him so hard. Don't worry, I know how to hold back my punches. Leave it. We're waiting for Politik. -What are they doing? -They went the other way. Maybe they couldn't get a cab. If they're not here in ten, we're off... You motherfucker! You fucking scared us! Molokoy got caught. We were walking down the street and saw some cops. The motherfucker panicked. I managed to run away. -For fuck's sake... -The bag. -I told you so! -No need to start an argument! We need to leave. Can't leave anything here. What about the split? We'll do it later. Give me your guns. I need to make them disappear. Give them, now! The other one too. Faster! Faster! I'll get a cab. Go ahead, I'll catch up. You all right? WE MUST FIGHT Linda? Police, hands up! Freeze! Turn around! Come over here. On your knees! I'd lived in shoeboxes before. I didn't give a shit about the lack of space. But not being able to see the sky, to touch Linda skin, or to caress her breasts... That was making me sick. Hey. I'm so happy to see you. You should move on. I'll be here for ten years. How could you say this? Show me your tits. -The guard's here. -I don't care. Let me see them. No. Do it for me, goddammit. It's all I got left. -Show me the Capitol. -No. -Show me the Capitol. -No. -Show me the Capitol. -No. Show me your pussy, goddammit. Let's go! Later on, when I'm back in my cell, I'll jerk off thinking about you. The visit's over. I knew I wouldn't see her again. Me being harsh was the price of her freedom. She got herself a new life, far away from me, and it's better that way... Come on, bro. Bring him over there, at the back! "History", according to Victor Hugo... "History... legend, reality, nature, beasts... everything here allows the imagination to recreate an outsized world; the world of rare objects... No longer hiding behind the cobblestones, the fortresses, the caverns, the giant beech trees... The Arab guy made it. Later on, I realized I'd fallen into the trap Politik had warned me about: the war between communities. Prison doesn't leave you any other choice... it dehumanizes you. It turns you into an animal. Convict 87-696, Larivière. Hello. I'm Patrick Chamoiseau. I'm your educator, Mr. Larivière. You peers have been harsh with you. I was told you went to the hole. I'm good... I've been working with convicts for a few years now. I don't live in a cell, but there are things I can understand. A black educator for a nigga convict, is that how it works now? I have bad news for you... Your godmother, the lady who raised you... is deceased. I'm sorry. Take me back to my cell. The head warden asked me to check the books you've ordered. Did you know these were subversive titles, according to the prison administration? But, hey, I took it upon myself to bring them to you. Where does this interest in books come from? Combatting misery through education, that's exactly the mission I'm trying to fulfill. Without books and poetry, I never would have experienced these infinite spaces... "Infinite spaces"? -Yes. -Yeah? Behind bars? I like your sense of humor! France is a woman that I robbed and screwed, and she's making me pay. I'm talking brutal coitus, and you're talking poetry. Fucking poetry... "Infinite spaces"... -Hello? -Hi, Princess! Pops! How are you? You okay? Tell me everything! What have you been up to with Mammy Dèle? Pops, where are you? Come on, what you've been up to? Did you go to the beach? Do you have any friends? What games do you play? Pops, where are you? Nearby, Princess... Nearby. Pops, I want to know where you are! I'm fine, don't worry about me. Where are you, Pops? Please? It just gets a bit chilly around here. -You're not back in the streets, are you? -It's winter here. You're not sleeping outside, are you? No, my dear, everything's fine. Odile, I won't be able to come back right away. I wanted you to know that. Pops, my heart aches. Look at the stars. I can see them too. It's as if we were together. Will you look at them tonight? Yes, I will. I love you more than anything, forever. I need to go now, sweetie. Hold on, Pops! Wait! Jimmy, can I ask you a personal question? Yeah? When you were planning your heists, what were your goals? Our goals? Everyone had their own goals. Money, revolt, vengeance... Heists were probably a bad shortcut, but this is we expressed our rage. -Why don't you tell your story? -I can't write. You can't? Well, no. You have a talent, Jimmy. A real talent. I saw the letter you sent to the judge. It's a beauty. I mean, the syntax could be-- Do your job as an educator, but don't ask me to turn into you... Write it down, Jimmy. Speak up... About my big heists? They'll add ten years to my sentence. Chamoiseau was right. This is how I started writing my novel. I never saw Jackson again. He's probably boxing his own ghosts somewhere. Molokoy had ratted on us. He died of an overdose a few years after he got out of prison. Politik was given an early release and vanished. I finally understood, after all those years, that our struggle should not be a racial struggle but a social one. However, that's not the path France has taken... LOÎC LERY WAS GIVEN A TEN-YEAR SENTENCE. AFTER SEVEN YEARS, HE WENT HOME TO MARTINIQUE, WHERE HE STILL LIVES TO THIS DAY. PATRICK CHAMOISEAU QUIT HIS JOB AS AN EDUCATOR IN FRENCH PRISONS AND TOOK UP WRITING. HE WAS AWARDED THE GONCOURT AWARD IN 1992 FOR HIS FIFTH NOVEL, "TEXACO."
