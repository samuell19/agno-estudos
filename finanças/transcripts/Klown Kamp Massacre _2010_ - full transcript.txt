How do you get the time and date off it? Huh. That's obnoxious. Mom, this is-- this is Klown Kamp. It's been an interesting trip here. As you can see, the bodies that surround this room and lay on the floor are people I've murdered. I'm sure you'll hear about it. Other than this videotape, it'll be on the news and stuff. I hope you're not mad at me. I-- I did it out of spite, I guess. I'm not sure exactly why I did it. And then we'll go down this hall. And, uh-- it's a nice hall. I do a lot of pacing in this hall. I call it my friendly hall. Here is the bathroom. I-- I clean up in here. I never wash my makeup off totally though cause I wanna be a clown forever. Sometimes, I gaze in my face in the mirror for hours and hours. And here's my room. And this is my bed. And you can see I have made it neatly, like you instructed me on a daily basis to do. It's the best way to start out the day. As you can see here, this is my roommate's bed. He leaves it a mess. He's a slobberoo. He's a pig of all kinds. He farts and snores and-- oh, there you are. There you are, you son of a bitch. [screaming] THEME SONG: I'm going to Klown Kamp. Klown Kamp. TV ANNOUNCER: May 15th, 1991. The massacre at the Bonzo Ranch.

In Hollywood's golden age, 1974 to 1991, many successful comedy entertainers began their careers at Bonzo's world famous Klown Kamp. Now by popular demand, it's back.

They call me Puff, Puff the Magic Clown. Philbert, do you want to see my wiener? Mm, no. I've already seen it. So who's the old guy? That's Bonzo from that old show. Another washed up TV clown. Really? The Bonzo? I didn't even recognize him. I grew up watching his show. I knew he owned the ranch, but I didn't think he'd actually be here. Why, he's the whole reason I became a clown. Are you sure you don't want to see my wiener? Yes. No. Yes. No. I mean, yes. Whoa! So nice to see other clowns out here. I'm headed to Bonzo Ranch. Thanks so much for picking me up. You wanna smoke some hash? Hey, you have a sunroof? I am the wind. You don't have to go so fast, mister. Slow down. You're totally killing my buzz. Hey, man. Wasn't that the turn right there? Hey, where are you going? [screaming] LENNY: Playing with shit is fun. This is great. I-- I'm so excited. Look, they have all the pie cans, and there's the-- It's too fucking early, and there ain't no goddamn coffee. [fart] Attention! Move it, move it, you maggots. Move, move, move. GERALD: Oh, my glasses. I am Sgt. Thadius Funnybone III. From here on out, you will address me as Sir. I'm here to teach you the skills and the techniques to make people laugh. [laugh track] You will be put through the most grueling clown, comprehensive, concentrated training on this planet. And if you want to cry to your mommy, you best go home now, party clown. Wipe that smile off your face. You will learn mime, table slides, spit takes, juggling, everything you're gonna need to make little boys and little girls squeal with delight when you walk in the room. Got that, Nancy Boy? This is the worst group of clown I ever seen. FUNNYBONE: You dumb, boy? Don't be so hard on them, Tex. I think they're going to make a swell team. Look like a bunch of losers, you ask me. Isn't there some hay that needs baling? You will be assigned a pie tin and a seltzer bottle with your name clearly marked on it. If you lose these items, they will be replaced. But it will be deducted from your deposit! Oh. This little, pretty, pink, pony clown, huh? You think you're special? You think because your grandpappy owns this ranch, that you can just come and go as you please, huh? You're gonna get special treatment? Who's that? FUNNYBONE: Well, you're wrong! Her name is Valerie. She's Bonzo's granddaughter. Wow. She's beautiful. You think you're too good to be a clown? VALERIE'S FATHER: You're a clown. FUNNYBONE: Too good to be a clown? Eat your cream pie. You think you're too good to be a clown. You're gonna get it. [slapping] [crying] Did you hear me? Yes, sir. You need a serious attitude adjustment. What the hell? Who's there? [screaming] EDWIN: So funny. ANNOUNCER: So you want to be a clown? Lasting education, field trip, presentation. The history of clowning dates back to the beginning of time. Clowns have been around forever. ANNOUNCER: Some say clowning is the second oldest profession. The second oldest profe-- I wonder what number one was. Hey, I made you something. Hey, I want a balloon. A penis? Oh, what? It's a pirate sword. You know? For pirates? No thank you. I can make you a wiener dog. ANNOUNCER: This is no laughing matter. I want a wiener dog. [guitar playing] [owl hooting] PUFF: Wow, he's really good. Uh, thank you. Do you hear that? Beautiful. Now that's talent, huh? We're gonna be frickin' rich. And as his agent, I get 90%. You all know this place gots a death curse, right? What did you say? Ah, he's fuckin' lying. Nah, nah, nah. I ain't playing. I know why this place been closed for 15 years. I ain't trying to scare nobody, but yo, this place gots a legend, a dark secret, if you will. It was was years ago to this day. Edwin came to Klown Kamp to make his dreams come true. EDWIN'S MOTHER [VOICEOVER]: Dear Edwin. I'm so very proud of you. Don't tell your father. He still thinks you should be an inventory clerk. But I saved up to buy something for you. EDWIN: Oh, Mom. EDWIN'S MOTHER [VOICEOVER]: Live your dream, son. Love, Mom. BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: But yo, destiny had other plans. Edwin the Clown didn't make no one laugh the whole time he was at camp. EDWIN: Stupid, stupid, stupid. BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: It was the very last day of Klown Kamp. This was his last chance. Yo, he knew if he didn't get some laughs that night, his ass would flunk the fuck out, effectively ending his circus career. Check it. He was nervous as hell. C-- can I please have a volunteer from the audience? Oh, thank you. Come on up, sir. BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: Then the moment of truth flew down like a bird bringing worms to his little baby birds. Boy, you look like you're tired and you've had a rough day. But this time, he was prepared. He had a funny ass joke. Boy, I-- I bet you'd probably like to have a seat, huh? BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: It was his night. Nobody wanted to see him fail. [cell ringing] Hello? No, I'm at Klown Kamp right now. I'm on a cellular phone. No, I'm not at home. BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: They didn't have a no cell phones policy back in the day. No, I need another chance. Thank you very much. That was Edwin. No! No, no, no. I need just one more chance, that's all I need. Please move away from the stage. [babbling] HOST: Does anybody hear me? If I don't graduate, I'm not gonna have all my dreams come true. Get off the stage. Other people are waiting. HOST: No pie throwing. No pie throwing. If I see another pie-- BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: That's when the phantom entered into his soul. It's not fair! BUZTER [VOICEOVER]: Edwin didn't think it was fair that his routine got jacked. So the next day at graduation, Edwin came back for his revenge against the whole camp. He sliced them, diced them, cut them up. Shoved a gad up their ass, splattered their guts. Shunned by a would that he didn't create. They tried to escape, but it was just too late. [RAPPING] He's an original clown killer, murderer. Cap peeler, soul stealer. The maven of mayhem. With evil eyes, and knives, and ice pick, and bloodlust precision, he murdered the whole fucking camp. And he even ate some of them while they were still breathing. I think. He became a bona fide killer. Then he put all the bodies into a clown car and dumped them in that Sparkling Lake. Ain't no one heard from him since. Some people say if you listen real good, you can still hear him practicing his routine. [screaming] No, guys, guys. No, it's just me. It's Gerald. Look, I got the glasses and the nose my mom bought me. You're a bunch of fucking pussies. Guys, I just, uh-- guys? [scream] Somebody help him! This guy's gone crazy. He's gotten mad cow disease. What the [thud] fuck are you doing? Jesus, fuck. Get him off of me. Get him off. [crying] Get him off. I'm holding you liable. I am filing a class action suit for the damage you did to Lenny. -I saw birdies. -Shut up. Birdies. I'll beat that rap just like I beat your grandmama's pussy. And frankly, you're lucky that big ass ape didn't pounce on me, because I'll fuck him up. I'm a psychopathic lunatic killer. And that's what I'm gonna prove in court, huh? You're fucking with some dark forces, bitch. Hi, Valerie. Look. Sausage is my breakfast fever. [ECHO] Breakfast fever. VALERIE'S FATHER: Valerie. Valerie. Valerie. I just wanted to give you a little kiss good night. Oh. You wanna see Daddy's wiener? [unzipping] Get the hell away from me. [crying] Sorry. Jesus. I didn't mean to scare you. Can I sit down? I don't care. You know, I've known Squirts for a long time. He's just a misunderstood guy. Really. I mean, one time, at the Children's Hospital, he actually-- I don't even want to be here. My grandpa wanted me to come. He doesn't understand though. I'm not a clown. Many of you have thrown a pie to a face. But how many of you have thrown a pie 500 yards? Holy shit. Now let's see what you amateurs can do. Well. Look who decided to join us for class today. Are you two finished jelly dicking around? You think you can come and go as you please? Actually, sir, it's entirely my fault. Is that true, Pink Princess? Well then, I have an errand for you, boy. Fuck you, Grandma Bonzo. Hey. These shoes are not for hiking. Oh, god. Buzter, you're a dick. Dick. Dick. What are you doing here? Man, Funnybone's a bitch. We could use a little help here. Hey. What are you listening to? Tsk. MC Murder 'N' the Maniac Circus Orchestra. What the fuck you think, dog? Right. The three-cord rage-rock with their drum machines and their sophomoric rap lyrics. Those guys are a fucking disgrace to clown rap genre if you ask me. [scream] Ah! Buzter! Buzter! It's my whole way of life. And I ain't gonna die for shit. Buzter! Buzter, no! Chill out, homie. What's that? Is that part of the camp? Oh shit! Holy shit. Oh. What are you talking about? I don't think this is part of the camp. Stop. This will definitely-- definitely result in us not getting our deposit back. What is this place? This must be part of the old Klown Kamp where the Edwin murders went down. OK, I'm outta here. Hey. I thought you made that up. Nah, dog. All my homies know who Edwin was. He's the original clown killer. There's food in here. Who's is this? Whoa, Frugo. Wait, Buzter. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Pfft. Frugo Lite. Hey, guys. Told you. There's a sleeping bag in here. Someone was living here. Yep, I'm outta here. OK. Here we go. Fuckin' pussies. What the-- oh shit. Where the hell are those boys with that seltzer? Got to warn them about the death curse. Who's there? You shouldn't be out here. There's a death curse. [screaming] Damn, this is far. Stupid ass-- I tell them to get the seltzer. I don't know what they're doing. I'll find them and use some-- that's what's gonna happen. What the hell? [laughter] Who's there? Wouldn't you like to know? Who's there? You come back here. I'll find you. No, you won't, you idiot. Get back over here. I'll find you. You've run from me. Over here. Over here. Remember me? Keep following me. Over here. Over here. Over here. You!

So is there no class today? No. We got a substitute. [monkey noises] [whistles] This is weird. I can't believe Funnybone would leave that guy in charge.

[laughter] Ugh, Frugo Lite! EDWIN: It's got less calories. Let's check that thermometer. [gurgle] Whoa! Now he wants chicken soup. Why would somebody do that to Grandpa Bonzo? He'd never hurt anybody. But wasn't he a member of the Klown Klux Klan back in the old days? And didn't they lynch hundreds of mimes and trapeze artists? Hey, they did a lot of charity work, too. I'm saying, kicking puppies is just-- [loud sobbing] Valerie-- [fart noise] Puff, this is time for jokes. That's not my gag! [glass breaking] Oh, good. Vinnie's OK. He's just sleeping.

They're 12! I swear, they're 12! What about rumors that you've got work done on your nose? No, it's a new nose-- it's real, it's real! Is it true you were arrested in a Tokyo airport with a half ton of helium? Wait. What's that got to do with anything? If Grandpa Bonzo hadn't lost his TV show, he never would have opened this camp and none of the murders would have happened. Grandpa Bonzo was the only person I could trust. You can trust me, Valerie.

You'll be clowned like never before. Thanks, ladies and gentleman, and good night. [frugo theme playing] VICK: Frugo is the magic drink that has made me the celebrity victim that I am today. EDWIN: I can't believe they got that son of a bitch to play me! I didn't give them permission to do that. My entertainment lawyer screwed me! Yeah, I was-- I was really freaked out for awhile. I mean, come on. There was blood and guts everywhere. I was surprised to-- yeah. I was surprised at who came out. I was promised a bigger role. I'm glad it had a happy ending. [squeaking] I just want to say I'm proud of every one of those guys. In my opinion, they're all winners. In the way that isn't actually winning-- in that kind of more loser way. Yo, out of the ashes rises the phoenix of the greatest rock and roll story ever told, and that's a Bust a Pie. Check this shit. This album coming out Tuesday. I know there's no parental advisory sticker on here, but I can assure you this shit is dirty. Yeah, bitch Just look at him-- he's useless. Can't sing "Happy Birthday," can't blow out a candle, can't honk his horn. [HIGH-PITCHED] Oh, fuck yeah. I would like to cure cancer. EDWIN: Oh, that's beautiful. I'd like to buy a really big pickle. EDWIN: What? [HIGH-PITCHED] I never loved you. It's just not true that steroids enhance your funniness. Although some of the side effects, like the shrinking of the testicles, can make one funnier. Ah-- ah! Hey Philbert, have you talked to Valerie recently? Woo? Um-- all the crying and all that bullshit-- you know, I could kind of tell she had some emotional problems. So I don't even know what she's doing now. [faint voices] [door slam] NURSE: Dr. [inaudible] please. EDWIN: Oh, that poor girl! Look what those sons of bitches did to her! This show sucks! Cheer up! You've just won a lot of money! EDWIN: Fuck you, Foxy McCool! I'm going to kill you! I'm gong to kill my lawyer! I'm going to kill every one of those fucking fuckers! Hey, I'm having fun! Look at me, I'm dancing! I'm doing the, um-- you know, before I had Frugo, I couldn't get a date. Now I go out with John Travolta, Lance Bass-- we have the best time! Frugo Onion! It's also good if I'm not in the mood to fuck my wife, because then my breath stinks and she'll leave me alone and I can go out with the gay hookers! ANNOUNCER: Coming up next, it's "Death Curse," the reality show. Can you survive the death curse? We've resurrected Camp Sparkling Lake's infamous axe-wielding killer.

This week, Barbara finds out that Cindy has been sleeping with her boyfriend-- and the killer, too! I thought he loved me. And then he tried to kill me!
