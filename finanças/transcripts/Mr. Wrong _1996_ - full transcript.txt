Uh, miss alston, How does a woman like you wind up doing something like this? I don't know. All i know is i was 31 and still single. Uh-Huh. Go on. And my sister was 25 and getting married. It was a beautiful wedding. Really. I was really happy for her, and i was havin' a great time. That is, until all the pressure started. Well, i guess it won't be long Before we're shopping for baby clothes. Mom, they just got married. And you'll be next. Gee, mom, did you just find out you had a year to live or somethin'? Come on, jan. Give the kid a break. She's got a lot going on in her life. She's bright, she's beautiful, She's got a great job, and we're very proud of her. - Thanks, dad. - Sure, honey.

You honestly believe that? I do. I really do. On my good days. And if it doesn't happen, so what, you know? I mean, i have a great life. I'll be fine. I'm gonna stop looking, 'cause that's when it happens anyway, When you're not looking. Yeah. We should just kick back and let it happen, If it's supposed to.

It's a little late to be modest, isn't it? Well, people who live in glass houses better wear shorts. Isn't that a saying or something? "The three-Fingered dawn creeping slowly over the h ills "And the footh ills of one's cerebellum "Bleeds profusely for the loss "Of all one believes in. "Souls unlit by flame, "Untouched by passion and unknown by others, "Transported from one place "To another... "Places with in "And without, "Places we're afraid to cry about yet "Gladly call home like e.T. "Still, though, "The sh ip courses on, "Through the blood-Red, "Three-Fingered waters, "Headed homeward "Like a tired sailor, "Headed homeward, "Homeward Towards love." That... That was beautiful.
