It's begun! It's so pretty. It was a great decision to come here during the fireworks festival! We get a perfect view of Mount Fuji and the fireworks. This is wonderful! Yes. Ms. Toba, the fireworks have started. Fireworks are, you know... It should be almost ready. Here we go! The chicken's done! We're all done here, too! - Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food! So good! This is good! The salsa sauce goes great with it. The chicken's cooked to perfection, too. Yes! Delicious. It's okay. So beautiful! Look, Rin! Either eat or speak, not both. You're going to choke if you speak while eating. Camping as adults, huh? Once you start working, you get more money to spend. There's more things we can do now, so maybe we can try different types of camping, too! I want a wood stove. If I have one, we can camp whenever we like! If that's the case, Chikuwa can come camping with us too. I want to get a driving license and go camping at different places! We can make food using local ingredients. - Sounds good! - Sounds good! What about you, Rin? I want to buy a big motorcycle and go camping overseas. Wow. That sounds great, too. When we grow up and become adults, I hope we can... try out different camping methods together. Me too. Can't stop my days Just like a spinning zoetrope Even if you look away The world is changing at a dizzying pace Start my day off Sometimes the night may feel longer But morning will come riding on a clear breeze The weekdays take a long detour But every single day is my joy It's fine not to look back We can start over again and again The sun is always coming up The sky is filled with light Anytime, anywhere It's okay, the sun is coming up The overlapping yesterdays are your guiding light They will lead you to tomorrow Come on, let's go search for smiles I'm walking in the sunlight LAID-BACK CAMP THE MOVIE "Editing department" "Good food in Nagoya" "Stylish and cute! A cafe tour in Nagoya" All right. Morning. Good morning. You're early, Mr. Kariya. I thought you were out on a business trip yesterday. That's right. I have a draft deadline first thing in the morning. Our chief editor is such a slave driver. Geez. In any case, you're early as well, Shima. My habit from being in the business department is hard to shake off. Oh, I see. Here you go, a souvenir. "Yamanashi Limited Edition One-Bite Tsukapon Grape Chocolate" Yamanashi limited edition Tsukapon? Right. You're from Yamanashi, aren't you? Yes. Thank you. Huh? Is this is the project you're submitting today? Didn't you come up with something else the other day? I couldn't put my ideas quite together for that. I'll put that off for now. "Print" "Sachihoko walks" For this project, I would like to focus on cafes popular among young women. The theme revolves around introducing stylish and cute cafes that offers unique desserts such as waffle toasts that highlights the charms of Nagoya. We will gather data centered around Meiki and Isaka, and create a map for readers to enjoy cafe-hopping... "Rejected!" I'll check on the new issues at the bookstore, and head for lunch after that. Right. The print proof will be done after 2 p.m., so be back by then. I understand. "Junhedo Bookstore" "Taken near my house!" "It's quite significant when you see it from Tokyo." Okay... All done! Are you done, Kagamihara? It's perfect! Looks pretty good. Right. You're on break tomorrow, right? Are you heading to the mountains again? I'm thinking of going back home. It's been a while since my sister went back. Excuse me. Welcome. We're looking for a bonfire stand. We want to try camping outside of summer. Sounds great! Camping after summer can be really enjoyable, too! This multi-functional stand here allows you to cook your food in a variety of methods. Bonfire cooking sounds good. Oh... But it's quite pricey. Are you sure you want to go camping during the cold season? Our kid's still young. You're right, but... Excuse me. If you're going camping in the summer, you should have all the required equipment ready, right? Yes. If that's the case, why not forget about cooking using a bonfire stand and get a simple bonfire stand instead? We have a few available within a reasonable price range. - She's right. - Yeah. Where can I see those? Oh, they're available over there. You can find them at the store diagonally opposite from ours. Thank you very much. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! You should promote our own products, too. I'm sorry, Ms. Komaki. But in any case, I'm sure they'll come back to visit us in the future. Found it! This is the one, right? The one displayed here. "Mini Gas Lantern" Huh... A gas lantern? It's quite expensive. Small and cute, don't you think? But you don't even go camping in the first place. W-Well, you're right... Would you like to try lighting it up? So pretty. - It's really cute. - It calms me down. Right. It's been a while since I got to rest over the weekend. This is awesome. I went to Mie last month, so should I try the inland this time? "You have a new message" "I'm at Nagoya now." Huh? Man, it's really been quite some time! When was the last time we met again? Our last camp together, three years ago. How many times do I have to repeat? Nagoya chicken wings are delicious! You're really such a bad drunk, Chiaki. A refill, please! In the end, it turns out that our schedule just couldn't fit at all. Yeah, but I saw Nadeshiko's photos! Right. She's as cheerful as ever. Thank you for waiting. So, have you been camping recently? I barely had the chance ever since I got transferred. Right, you're in the editing department now. How is it? I'm getting by somehow. How's your event planning company going along? Me? Well, I... - I quit! - What? To be exact, I changed careers a while back and went to Yamanashi. So you went back. Hello, I'm Ogaki from the Yamanashi Tourism Promotion Board! Tourism Promotion Board? What does that mean... My job is to make Yamanashi exciting! What's this? "Yamanashi Product Exhibition" An animal costume I wore for a product exhibition. It's a mascot for an earthenware product! My current project is the redevelopment plan for Takaori! Takaori? There's a facility around this area that went down a few years ago. The facility covers a wide area and it seems like a waste to leave it abandoned, so we wanted to do something about it. This sounds interesting, but I have no idea what to do with it. If the place is really that wide, you could just turn it into a camping site. Huh? Bill, please! Team Member Shima! I would like to hear more details about your proposal! What? To Fujikawa, Yamanashi, please! Hey... Got it! Where are we going? We're coming, Takaori! This is Takaori, situated in Fujikawa of Yamanashi Prefecture. Known as the "Village of the Rising Sun," it is famous for the "Diamond Fuji" where sunrise would overlap with the peak of Mount Fuji from winter solstice to New Year's Day. Thank you! I can't believe we really came here. Look, that's the facility I was talking about. It's completely abandoned. It's been five years since they closed down. It's going to take a ton of work if we turn this place into a camping site. No, I wasn't being serious... "13 November, 5:20 A.M." Guess I have no choice but to wait until morning and call home. So warm... Scary. "Fujikawa Youth Nature Center" So it's really abandoned. Doesn't look like a lot of people would come if you build it in a place like this. It takes some navigating to reach as well. It's surprisingly wide. I think we can use this place once we fix it up. They have toilets here, too. I see... There's a flight of stairs as well. Let's take this path instead. There's a place to fetch water. Of course there's no water now. What's that? A jungle gym? Doesn't seem like it. Is there more below? Is this some workshop? Did they build this themselves? It looks interesting. Is this the end? Did you take a look around? There's grass all over the place, and the site is abandoned. A perfect camping site, don't you think? Like I said... To be honest... I was thinking of turning this place into a camping site as well. I talked to my superior and gained approval for it as well. You know... My current workplace invited me to work with them right when I thought I was having a fulfilling life in Tokyo. When I heard about this, I thought this is going to be so much fun. Maybe I just like this place. But when I came back, parts of this place looked desolate. This place was once built for people to gather and have fun together, right? I believe that places like this should continue to exist. I don't have a lot of budget or manpower, so I was planning to recruit some volunteers. Since you're here, would you like to try building this place together? I'll think about it. I knew you'd agree, Team Member Shima! I believed in you! H-Hey! You guys! Rin! Aki! What? N-Nadeshiko? It's been a while, you two! Nadeshiko. Why are you here? What? I mean, - Aki told us all to gather here. - What? "Rin and chicken wings, delish!" "On a taxi straight to Yamanashi!" "The taxi meter's crazy!" "Everyone, gather in Yamanashi!" You sent it to Aoi and Saito, too. Huh? We weren't supposed to meet? Sorry to make you come all the way from Tokyo! No, it's fine! I was already back here last night! - Right! - Huh? Shall we have hotpot together? - Crab meat... - This is awesome! It's a souvenir from my older sister. No need to hold back. We have a lot here. - Okay! - Okay! Thank you for the food! Delicious! You can taste the thick crab flavor with just one spoonful of the soup. The warm broth is warming up my cold body! Not to forget the soft tofu, as well as the napa cabbage that soaked up the broth, the spring onions, shiitake mushrooms, and... The crab meat is so sweet! Ouch! Ouch! No one's talking at all. Sorry I came late. When did you reach, Inuko? Just now. Besides, you guys were too engrossed in eating the crabs. That was so delicious! In any case, it's been a while since I saw you two! Yeah. You have work today? Elementary schools are really busy during this period of time. I have to work over the weekends. Is Ena not coming today? Right, she has work the entire day. "Sorry, I can't make it today!" She works at a pet salon. She's probably more busy during the weekends. In any case, regarding the building of the camping site... That's quite sudden. Camping? Are you building a camping site? Calm down, Nadeshiko. So you're really going to work on that. Right. Would you guys care to join me? Rin is really excited about it! Wait, I wasn't really... I'll join! Building a camping site together sounds like so much fun! But won't it be tiring? Aki and I live here, but Nadeshiko's currently living in Tokyo, Ena's in Yokohama and Rin's in Nagoya. It'll be fine! I'll make it work somehow! Right, Rin? Well... You're as cheerful as ever, Nadeshiko. All right! Ena also confirmed her participation! We have everyone's approval now. From today onwards, all five of us will work together and build the camping site. Before we proceed, let me assign everyone your titles! - What? - What? First, Nadeshiko will be the supervisor! "Nadeshiko Kagamihara Supervisor" Inuko will be in charge of our schedule! "Aoi Inuyama Schedule Manager" Ena will be in charge of PR! "Ena Saito PR Officer" And I will be mostly be in charge of behind-the-scenes work! "Chiaki Ogaki Behind-The-Scenes" And the overall leader of this project... will be you, Rin! "Rin Shima Overall Leader" Nadeshiko's got the stamina for this. You'll be perfect as the supervisor! You can leave all the muscle work to me! Right? I came up with everyone's work scope based on what we're each good at. H-Hold on. Why am I the leader? You have the most experience with camping. Isn't it perfect? When it comes to camping, you're the person to ask! I'm counting on you, Leader! I'll make sure not to bother you as much as possible. Nadeshiko's taking me home. Got it. Make sure to thank her. You think we can really do it? But, doesn't it feel exciting to work on something new? Let's work on planning the campsite next! I have to submit a concrete plan to the prefectural office, too. Hey! I'll be attending the next session! It's been a while since we met you, Ena! That's right! All right, we'll meet at the prefectural office then! Keep up the good work, everyone! - Got it! - Got it! "Haps Motorcycle Accessories" I heard everything from Nadeshiko. You're building a camping site? Yeah. You're the leader, Rin? That's so cool. That's not cool at all. How long does it take to reach the camping site on motorcycle? Four hours from Nagoya. Four hours? It's going to be tiring to travel back and forth frequently. It isn't, surprisingly. Grandpa travelled to Yamanashi with that motorcycle, too. He's as energetic as ever. Shima. I've finished replacing the oil. Thank you. Looks good. You too, Rin. You think so? "Shachihoko Publishing" There's a lot of things I'll have to research on, "Hamana Local Specialty: Una-Una Pie" but I've decided to work on it with friends back in my hometown. Wow, a camping site? Sounds interesting! Building a camping site from scratch? Wouldn't this make a good topic for our local magazine? What? Don't you agree, Chief Editor? Okay. Really? It'll be too much work to send a writer there, so you'll need to write the article yourself. You'll need to upload an online article, too. Submit the proposal by this week. Yes, I will make one immediately. Hey! Here she comes! Ena! Sorry to keep everyone waiting! It's been a while! Great to see you again! Good work today. Glad to see you doing well. All right, everyone's finally gathered! Yeah! This will be our operations center. Th-This is... - So small! - So small! I asked them to lend me a room for the project, and this is what they gave me. It's just like the Outclub. Right. We only use it for meetings, so this should be good enough. Oh... What's this? This is the tourism PR robot, Ginger! Get along with him, okay? Why is a robot made for tourism in a place like this? Well, he had his fair share of problems. Huh? Let's play Rock, Scissors, Paper! Rock, Scissors, Paper! Okay, I win! It's just a robot that plays Rock, Scissors, Paper. "1. Planning 2. Site Work 3. Operation" I did some research. To make a camping site, we need these three points. First, we'll need to think about our target audience and do some planning for the website. At the same time, we'll have to work on site. We'll probably have to work in shifts depending on our schedules. And lastly, we need to prepare for the opening. We'll need to create a booking system and an operation manual for that. - I see. - I see. Then, we should start with planning first. We need to think about our target audience, and what place do they want. I want it to be a place where friends and families can enjoy their time together! It'll be great if solo campers can enjoy a relaxing time hereas well. I want it to be a place where kids can have fun. We can have a kids' zone, for example. I also want to create a space for dogs and people can bring dogs along while camping, too. I have a handful of customers who like camping, too. It'll be great if this camping site where different people can enjoy staying the way they want! You're right. Then, let's head to the site and come up with concrete ideas. Shall we go mow the grass, too? - Agreed! - Agreed! Okay, everyone! First, we work on this! Weekend Warriors, Work Costume Rangers! "Weekend Warriors: Work Costume Ranger" They have gloves and tools here, too. The last time we wore identical uniforms was back in high school! Right. This is making me excited! What's that? I'm thinking of recording a video of our work. It might come handy. I see! As expected of our PR officer! Well then, everyone. Let's hear a word from everyone! I'll do my best, little by little! What are you guys doing? Stop playing around and get to work. - Okay! - Okay! Huh? It's so hard to cut these! I can't take it off! This is harder than I expected. I never tried cutting grass myself. Huh? My god, the back of the building is full of trash too. We'll have to clean these up. Right. My back hurts! Me too! Change with me, Rin! We've only just started. Huh? Hey! What do you think that is? I was wondering about that, too. That thing? That's a cage. A cage? In the previous facility, it was a place where you could interact with birds and stuff. But the net holes are too big, and... and birds escaped in one day. Not exactly a laughing matter, if you think about it. What should we do about it? We'll probably have to tear it down. We're not getting much progress. Hey, Ogaki! Mr. Okazaki! Here's some yuzu I grew at home! Wow, this is amazing! Thank you so much! Wait, you guys are cutting grass by hand? But it isn't going very well. Grab the grass with your thumb facing downwards like this, and cut near the roots. Saws are made to saw down branches easily. Press down lightly, and use just a little force when pulling back the blade. It'll get tiring if you do this for a long time, so be sure to make full use of the blade's length. Wow. Be careful now. - Thank you so much! - Thank you so much! He taught us so many things. Does he live nearby? Yeah. That's Mr. Okazaki, a farmer. You warm up to people fast, Aki. I often talk to people who live around the area. I try to be careful, but sometimes I might be intruding on their work. I hope the people here enjoy camping life, too! I cut them off easily! Right, it feels so different now! All right. You cut so much. Yeah. The grass cutting is going well, too. Everyone! Shall we call it for a day and have some tea now? - Agreed! - Agreed! - Here you go. - Thanks. It smells great! I used the yuzu we received and put some in the hot lemon tea! I see! I can feel the fatigue melting away! So good. The scent of yuzu calms me down. Right. It's been a while since we sat together like this. Back in high school, we used to have coffee around a bonfire in the school yard. That takes me back. In any case, you can see Mount Fuji so clearly. This is a great place. I gave it a thought, and I think we should be able to do something about the camping site if we maintain the terraced areas. I agree. What's left is to see how we can implement the ideas we brought up. Wait, let me do a sketch! We'll make an area for solo campers, families, as well as a zone each for dogs and kids... "Management Building, Solo Zone, Family Zone, Water Fetching Area" It should look something like this! Oh, this looks good! "Kids playground, Dog run" We have a lot of ideas. It does look like we have sufficient space for everything. But we'll be tearing down the bird cage, and if we build playground equipment and fences... We might not have enough budget for that. You're right. In order to consolidate all the ideas we have now, we might need a theme for this camping site. A theme? Simply put, the goal of this camping site. A theme, huh... I can't think of anything. Well, I'll be collecting some materials on other camping sites, so I'll think about that. - Collecting material? - Yeah. I will be writing an article on this camping site. - What? - What? You should have told us that sooner! I can't do that? Of course you can! It'll help create buzz! It's just a local Nagoya magazine. I don't think it'll help much in promotion. But, I think some people would be interested in this! Then, I'll go gather data next week and get in touch with everyone after that. Okay! Hello. I'm Shima, the one who contacted earlier. Oh, I've been waiting for you. This is a wonderful camping site. I visit here often. Right. The scenery here... It never changes. We try not to alter the natural scenery here as much as possible. In fact, it's left as is. As is? By doing so, it'll display the charms of the place itself. I visited a few places. I thought of something. Maybe we should make use of that certain thing instead of tearing it down. "Make use of that certain thing"... I think leaving that bird cage as is might allow it to blend in with the natural landscape. I agree. And making use of what we have can help save our budget, too. Then, why don't we make use of "those metal barrel at the back of the building? We might be able to use them for the dog run! Oh, that! Maybe we can talk to the locals too. They might be able to provide us with some things they have no use for! Yeah, that sounds great! Okay, I guess can give you a budget. Thank you so much! "Subheading: The Theme Is 'Restoration'" Thanks. Is that part of work? Yeah. You seem passionate about it. I guess. I'm going to peel some apples. - I'm eating. - I'm eating. All right. "29 Dec, Last day of work 30-31 Dec, Going Back to Home!" No wonder it's cold. Good work, Rin! Is it snowing in Takaori? Good work. I was there, but it wasn't snowing. I'm on my way back to Nagoya now. I parked my car at Yatsugatake. I'm having my lunch break at Dangozaka! Guess we missed each other. Yeah. I love eating food at rest stops. I always look forward to it! It gives me this sense of excitement during trips, and I get to eat local delicacies there! I get that. Rin, are you spending year end and New Year holidays at Nagoya? Yeah. I have to gather materials right after New Year's. I see. I guess we'll meet next year, then! Take care while driving! Happy new year. It's been a while since we met. Happy new year, Akari! Oh, I see that the small kid has learnt to greet her elders properly! You think so? Then, give me my New Year's money, Aki! She hasn't changed at all. How's the art university in Tokyo, Akari? The workload's heavy, but it's fun! Happy new year, everyone. Ms. Toba! "Hiking Course" I heard from Aoi. How's the camping site going along? How's the progress? We received approval from the prefectural office, and we'll officially start work after New Year's. Really? Could you please let me help out? Of course! How about helping us design the camping site logo? That sounds good! Inuyama. Are you teaching in Kajikazawa Fujimi Elementary School? If I recall, in March... So you know. This must be a tiring period for you. Make sure to rest well. Thank you for your concern. Would you like to go for a drink together, Ms. Toba? I found a shop that serves a huge collection of Japanese sake! Really? We have to go, then! I heard the food there is great too! Sounds great! "Happy new year, Rin!" "Happy new year, Shima!" "Good work!" "Here's to another year yet again!" "Fujikawa Youth Nature Center" Let's go! Our first session of the new year... Weekday Warriors, - Work Costume Rangers! - Work Costume Rangers! "Weekday Warriors: Work Costume Rangers" I guess our poses change depending on whether it's weekday or weekend. For now, we'll work on cutting the grass today! By the way, when will the camping site open? Good question. It'll be July this year! Then we only have six months left! There's professional constraints to consider! We managed to get the proposal approved despite that! Aki... Okay, we'll make it work out somehow! "The Following Week" It's a shovel machine! Okay, let's do this! You're amazing, Nadeshiko! I took proper lessons for this, so you can leave it to me! Okay, I should start working too! A grass cutter! I borrowed this from Mr. Okazaki! I'll have it all cut in an instant with this! Our work's progressing smoothly today! Nadeshiko looks so cool! Aki looks just as good, too! We might finish levelling the land faster than expected! They all seem so excited. Make sure to leave some work for me, too. Here is a summary of the camping site project. First, grass cutting. The grass cutter is used to cut grass in wide areas, and the smaller areas are done by hand. An excavator is then used to level the ground. The broken stairs are fixed as well. The original building left behind is reformed into the management building. So good! They fill their stomachs with food. "Takaori Camping Site Development Schedule" Next is schedule management. Investigation of activity zones. Repairing water system. And many more. "Building A Camping Site, Volume 1" "Sounds interesting! I look forward to seeing the completed site!" "Everyone are having fun!" "Yamanashi's a little far, but I hope I can visit the place!" "I'm cheering for you!" What? Aki! This is terrible, Aki! Huh? Our food supplies... The garbage area... It's a complete mess. Is it caused by some animal living nearby? But there's deers, wild boars and monkeys living in the nearby mountains! To take appropriate measures, we'll first have to know what caused this. If it's a wild boar, it could be dangerous for us. I know someone who's perfect for this! So this is what Ginger's seeing? Yeah! Hopefully we can lure out whatever that was... Something's over there! Let's play Rock, Scissors, Paper! Rock, Scissors... - Ginger! - Ginger! Wait up... it's dangerous! It's raccoons? That scared me. I'm glad it wasn't a wild boar. For now, we should make sure not to leave our food in the open. I lose! Rin! Hurry up! Most of the area has been cleaned up. Right. "Kids' Zone: Under Construction" "Dog Run Estimate Location" Something's coming, Rin! What? That's... - Chikuwa! - It's Chikuwa! You run too much. Chikuwa's a grandpa now, after all. Hey, everyone's here? I guess this is all we got. Well then, let's begin our first trial camp in this camping site! - Let's do this! - Let's do this! We rented this tent from Nadeshiko's work place. I see. So she does things like that? It's huge! It should fit everyone with this size. I'm done assembling the tent poles! Got it. All right! The tent is complete! We managed to get it up. Right. Let's keep this up and get the other equipment ready. "Hagino Supermarket" "Natural Southern Bluefin Tuna" "Fresh Fish Special Sale Today!" Shall we go with this today, Aoi? All right. It will be a worthy opponent for us. Is this fine, Rin? Yeah. He's so energetic. We're back! We're done with the shopping! - Welcome back! - Welcome back. Wow, everything's all set up already! I think these ingredients should suffice. Right. I forgot the hotpot! I'm going to move some stuff, Aki. Go ahead. Huh? It's a firewood stove! We rented this from my store, too. Looks good! "Kids' Zone: Under Construction" That swing... I guess it's impossible to bring that over. This looks good. Hello! It's so hot! Okay. For today's ingredient... we have this! - It's salmon! - It's salmon! Isn't it too much for all of us? We got it at a good price! We're having a salmon party today! How to cook salmon soup. After water is boiled, add pepper corns, bay leaves, minced onion and carrots. After simmering for a short while, add in potatoes. Please wait for a while until they are cooked. I can't wait to see how it will turn out. "Ten Sages sake" Grilled salmon goes best with Japanese sake! When did she start drinking... She's just like Gubi-nee. Once the vegetables are cooked, add in the salmon. Then, add fresh cream and some salt. Lastly, add in some dill and the salmon soup is complete. - Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food! So good! It warms me up! This dish is so simple, and yet has such a thick and delicious flavor! I'm glad to hear that! The umami flavor of salmon and the vegetables is mixed with the mild, creamy soup... So delicious! I made a separate dish for Chikuwa! Thank you, Nadeshiko! This smells really good. It's the scent of dill. It's a type of herb! I see! The refreshing scent matches well with salmon! Right! It tastes as if I'm in the middle of a forest in Finland. And what kind of taste is that? Wait, we're already finished? Food just disappears when there's five of us. It's not over yet, Aki. What? The stew should be done by now. - What? - What? - There's another pot? - Since when did you have that? The salmon party's just getting started! This is salmon hotpot with tofu skin! This is so good! The taste of miso in the soup is comforting. I'm surprised that tofu skin goes well with salmon hotpot. We got some good tofu skin from Minobu. We also added milk and butter! No wonder it has such a mellow taste! For your information, we'll end the hotpot with hoto noodles! - Awesome! - As expected, Aoi! Your planning is perfect! Camp food cooked by ourselves during a camping trip tastes the best! We're still not done yet, though. In any case, doesn't this feel like a wonderful treat for ourselves? Yes. It was really tiring, but anything's possible if we try. Right! Is black coffee fine, Ena? Yeah! Thanks. We should start writing up our operation manual soon. I've given some thought to it. You're fast, Nadeshiko! Also, I was thinking that there's quite a distance from here to the toilets. Oh, you're right. The land is also uneven, so I almost tripped too. There were a lot of stairs, so it was tough moving things. It might be better if we rent a cart instead. Seems like we still have a lot of work. Hey, want to go over there? Just as I thought. It's just like a planetarium. This feels incredible. Right. We may have a lot of work, but it could be fun depending on the effort we put in. Right. She's having too much fun. Oh, Chikuwa! What did you pick up? What's that? A fragment from a plant pot or something? It could be more valuable than we think it is. If so, you did a great job, Chikuwa! Next up is the maintenance of the dog run! We're progressing faster than expected! Do you have a minute, Ogaki? Sure. What? "Shachihoko Publishing" "Shima - Yamanashi" I'm leaving. Have a safe trip. What's wrong? Actually, they're going to conduct an investigation in the camping site. Investigation? It's regarding the fragment that Chikuwa found the other day. I reported that to my boss just in case, and there's a possibility that it might be some sort of earthenware. Earthenware? It's quite common to dig up earthenwares in Yamanashi. Is that so? In any case, the investigation will only take a week to two at most. Then I guess we'll meet again once that's done. Right! Until then, it's break time for us. Yeah. Once the investigation is done, I'll let everyone know. So just take it easy until then. Okay, I understand. See you. Wait, so you're working on that as well? Well... I just thought of paying the printing company a visit once in a while. Aren't you taking on too much work? Why don't you split it with Shima? I want her to focus on what she wants to do at the moment. This is an important time for her. Mr. Kariya! Did you overhear our conversation? Please bring me along to the printing company, too! What? But... My schedule at Yamanashi today got canceled. Oh, I see... "More Veterinary Clinics And Pet Salons" There, there. Good boy. Be good and wait for your owner to come. Yeah, that's right. I won't be heading to Takaori, so I'm coming home straight. See you, Aoi! Call me Ms. Inuyama, not Aoi! Bye-bye, Aoi! "Camping Site Materials (1)" "Repair management block. Check water and electricity" "Bird cage will be left as is and cleaned up" Hello? Y-You know... The thing is, the fragment we found appears to be dated back to the Jomon period. The investigation will have to take a few months in order to excavate the artifacts. Then, we can just open the camping site after that... No, the thing is... They discovered a large amount of earthernware, so there's a proposal to turn that area into an artifact-related facility. What? They've decided to stop all work for the camping site and reconsidering what to do with that piece of land. Is there any chance that they will reconsider our initial plan? Excavating artifacts would help to promote that area. I think it'll be hard, to be honest. Everyone helped out so much for that project. I'm so sorry! "Kajikazawa Fujimi Elementary School" "School Closing Ceremony" "Thank you, Kajikazawa Fujimi Elementary School!" Hey! Is this all? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Will they demolish the school? They're still discussing about that. I see. That hurt! What are you doing? Good work, Inuko! Thanks. But it's not like I'm quitting as a teacher. I'll just be transferring to a new elementary school. Still, I feel a little sad. Just kidding. That was a lie! You... How dare you lie to me! - No! - Come back! - Don't do that, Aki! - You get what you deserve! I'm home. You can tell from the car engine? I see. You want to go for a walk, huh? "Shachihoko Publishing" "The 'Building a Camping Site' series has been cancelled" I've just sent the notification. Oh, okay. All right. - Good work. - Excuse me... Is there anything else I can help with? You should get off work. You took the last train home yesterday. It's fine. I have to make up for what I haven't done. You don't need to worry... I'll be fine. Then, could you please check the draft for our new issue? Yes. "One-Bite Tsukapon" Thank you. "Camping Site Materials (1)" Kagamihara. Yes? We just received the latest issue of Bivouac, so could you please place them on the display shelf? Yes! "Enjoy New Greenery While Camping" I guess it really is too expensive. Like I said, candles should do. But that'll look like some ritual. Huh? Those girls... Excuse me. Do you need anything? We've decided to go camping to commemorate our graduation. But we don't really know what we need. We need a lot of equipment, and it's quite costly. If this is your first time camping, you can choose to just have a picnic during the day. You can also set up a bonfire, and cook instant food. - Is that enough? - Of course! Anything will work. You can gather other equipment over time. Then, shall we have instant cup noodles? You just want to eat that, don't you? I'll get seafood flavor! And I'll get the usual soy sauce flavor. I'll have pork flavor, then. Why pork flavor? - That's so rare. - Shut up. Thank you very much! - What's the matter? - Huh? I just remembered about the time when I started camping. I hope they have fun. You're definitely a perfect fit for this job, Kagamihara. What? What? Why's there so many of them... Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Right. It'll be easier to eat like this. Why don't you have a break? What? Mr. Kariya? No, Shima needs more work. Chief Editor? I'll be fine! Please tell me if there's anything I need to do! It's done, Rin! Our camping site's completed! It's... finally done! Wow! You look like you're having fun. What? Off you go, Shima. Go gather data now. Wait, what? Now, off you go! Wait... - Have a safe trip! - Have a safe trip! Everyone... I'm really, really grateful. I'm leaving. What in the world was that? Are you at home, Ms. Shima? I'm from Sakura Delivery! Oh, yes! I'm sorry! "Dear Rin, have you been eating?" "I sent you some emergency food." "Take care of your health, okay?" "From Mom" Emergency food... "Rin! Want to visit the hot springs together?" Hot springs? Hot springs? This feels more like mountain hiking. You can do it, Rin! Soaking in the hot springs after this is going to be so awesome! The slopes aren't that tough, but it feels as if I walked for at least an hour. You don't even look tired, Nadeshiko. Stamina's my forte. Why don't you give me some of that? Hello. Hello. I know. Let's take our time. Feels good, doesn't it? And you were running around so much when we were at Takaori. So warm. "Incoming Call: Aki" That surprised me. What is it? Hey, Inuko. You know, I... - Here you go. - Thanks. You're having seafood flavor today. Just the other day, a few high school girls came to my shop. They were talking about which cup noodle tastes the best. So I thought it'll be nice to try some other flavor for a change. You still like curry flavor, Rin? "Curry Instant Noodles" Yeah. I'm digging in! I'm digging in. Oh, right! I made some rice balls! Here you go. They're huge. We should put on our climbing spikes from here on. Okay. "Ten Minutes To Honzawa Hot Springs" "Japan's Highest Open-Air Hot Springs" "Japan's Secluded Hot Springs, Honzawa Hot Springs" We finally reached. We'll buy a bath entrance ticket here, and walk a little more to the hot springs up ahead. We're still walking? My older sister told me about this place. Sakura? She called me the other day and I told her that our camping site plan got canceled. Since you have time to spare, why don't you visit this place? "Yatsugatake Honzawa Hot Springs" This place was featured in one of the TV shows. That's what she told me! Sounds like what Sakura would do. "Open-Air Hot Springs" This looks magnificent! The hot spring is over there! What? That's so small! Besides, it's built on a slanted slope. Doesn't this feel liberating? Where do we change clothes? We take off our clothes there. What? There's no one around, so it'll be fine. I can feel the fatigue in my body being cleansed away. You're right. Hot springs... Yeah? The older you get, the better it feels. I get that. We've all become adults. We're all working, we have more money to spend and we got to buy more camping equipment. We even got driving licenses, too. Right! We can travel to Tokyo or Yamanashi whenever we want! You've been traveling around by bicycle. I'm an adult now, okay? But... It's not like we're free to do anything we want. Takaori was fun. It felt as if we had a long camping session back there. I've always wanted to do something like that with you guys. And the idea of camping brought us all together again. Yeah. I agree. But, my workplace senior had so much more work to deal with because of me. I gave him too much trouble. - Did he get mad? - No. He's been supporting me the entire time. I also once thought that I'd be able to do anything once I became an adult. But in reality, I have responsibilities to bear and the work I have to do keeps piling up. In the end, I'm still supported by people around me even after becoming an adult. It made me realize that I'm not alone. I see. You're right. But you know... There are things that we can do since we're adults now. Like? Like... We can tell people around us how much we enjoy something, and those people would spread that joy to other people. We can create a place where something like that can happen. That was what we wanted to do with the camping site. Don't you think so? You're amazing, Nadeshiko. It would be incredible if that could be achieved. We can. You're the one who first taught me about how enjoyable camping can be! Was it? Did you forget? I do remember. Seriously... I wonder if there's any other way. Let's think about it. Then, shall we make our move? Hello... No one's around. Were we too early? - Huh? - What? A pinecone! Hello! Aki... Huh? What are you doing? I see intruders! It's just Nadeshiko and Rin. Oh, so it's you two! Don't scare me! We weren't. I was waiting, everyone... It's been a while, everyone! Huh? Sorry, was that too much? And so... Everyone's gathered here again! Yes! Listen up, everyone! Currently, it will be difficult to resume the camping site project. And to overcome that, Inuko and I have thought about how to approach the project considering the prefectural office and the excavation site's opinions. "1. revise our camping site project!" First, we'll have to revise our project! Revise? Currently, they are considering to turn that location into a museum of sorts. We won't go against that, but instead come up with a new plan for the camping site! In short... "Fujikawa Takaori Camping Site New Project Proposal" Ogaki. Are you serious about this? Yes, I am. "2. Speeding up." Next is the excavation process. In reality, they don't have sufficient manpower and is currently behind schedule. They won't be able to move on to the next process if they excavation work isn't showing any progress, so we'll help out in the excavation process. We'll join in the process and take shifts. Please guide us! We need all the help we can get. Also, I made lunch for everyone. Thank you for the food. That was delicious. Thank you! - Excuse me... - Yes? If you're willing to, could you tell me more about earthenwares and the Jomon period? What? "Shachihoko Publishing" You want to resume the article? Yes. We still don't have approval to resume the camping site project, but we're taking steps to do so. Of course, I'll work hard in my usual assignments too. Sure. Th-That was easy. You should accept help while you can. When I was young, the Chief Editor often helped me as well. You were much more troublesome. Don't say that! Thank you very much. "Swift as wind, Gentle as forest, Fierce as fire, Unshakable as mountain" Next, we'll talk about the excavation site in Takaori, Fujikawa. Currently, we have a proposal to turn the site into a cultural facility to display these artifacts. Pardon me. The Tourism Promotion Board has a new proposal with regards to that. Yes. Please take a look at this. Starting last year, we decided to retain the abandoned facility in Takaori to set up a camping site. The theme of the camping site is "Restoration." We aimed to reuse equipment there to create a place where everyone could find enjoyment in it. The development has been brought to a halt as Jomon artifacts have been discovered, but we also made our own discoveries from that. These are repair holes. We believe that the holes were made for ropes to pass through and mend the crack. Jomon people had a culture of repairing items and taking good care of them. Camping allows you to experience a different lifestyle, and gives you the opportunity to reflect on yourself. Through the restoration of this site and our attempt to turn it into a camping site, we reunited with friends and also earned the opportunity to reflect on ourselves. Regardless of the old facility or the earthenware that existed for a long time... No matter what they are, they have taught us valuable lessons. So... Our camping site aims to integrate both the ruins and earthenware into it! "Earthenware And Camping" "Ruins Exhibition Zone" "Earthenware Making And Fire-Making Experience" "Campfire And Earthenware Baking Zone" "A New Camping Site That Integrates: Camping And Archeological Ruins!" This is the new proposal we came up with. I hope you can reconsider this proposal! I understand. Please allow us to consider your proposal together with the existing one. Yes! Shall we go now? You're right. "Yamanashi Tourism Promotion Board" Ogaki. Regarding this application... Huh? She went to the preparation room. She said she's going to inform them the results. "New Camping Site Project Schedule" "Takaori Fujikawa Camping Site New Project Proposal" "Approved" We haven't been back for a while, and they've already grown this much. The grass here is really resilient. We won't lose to them, either! We might not be able to make it for the summer, but let's aim to open the camping site by autumn! Yeah! What? Wh-What is it? You seem pumped up, Rin. Th-That's not... Well then, a word from our leader! We can do this. - Yeah! - Yeah! We should start from the highest area. Yeah, you're right. We need some space here to set up tents, so please build them as close to the edge as possible. - It's done. - Got it! Ready, go! Oops... You need to use your hips! - Mr. Okazaki! - Mr. Okazaki! Here we go! This is how it's done. Rin! Nadeshiko! Do you have a minute? They said we can take whatever that's left behind here. I was thinking of using them for the kids' zone. How's this? It's fine! We're totally soaked! Akari gave this to me. Did you invite your families here? Yeah. They're more excited than I expected. I invited my co-workers over, too! Akari's coming too, right? Of course. She'll be coming with Ms. Toba. Here we go. I think it should be slightly to the right above. - Like this? - Yeah. All right! "Fujikawa Pinecone Camping Site" Ready, go! - It's done! - It's done! Let's see... We have stock broth, salt, garlic. Don't we need olive oil, too? Oh, right. In any case, it's been a while since we went camping. I'm going ahead first. - Got it. Be careful. - I will. A warning light for the engine? You should send it for servicing, just in case. But how do I get to Takaori now? How about that instead? What? "Fujikawa Pinecone Camping Site" "Camping Application Form" We have the application slips and stationery ready, too. We also have money ready, in case we need to find change. I've finished cleaning the toilets! Great! Thanks! For today, we have ten groups and two solo campers. That's quite a lot. Still, half of them are our acquaintances. This is good enough for the first day of business! "12:59 P.M." - It's almost time! - Yeah. "1 P.M." Huh? No one's here. None of them called to cancel. Well, you can't expect people to arrive right on dot. Right. Hello, this is Fujikawa Pinecone Camping Site. What? You don't know the location? - What? - What? You need a landmark? Please let me check and get back to you again. Didn't we prepare a ton of signboards? - We made them together, right? - Yeah. - Guys... - Huh? Are you talking about these? - What? - What? It's pointless if we don't put them up! Don't tell me our guests all got lost? "Incoming Call: Akari" Where are you, Akari? The thing is, I don't know where I'm at... I'm completely lost! - I'll go fetch her. - What? Nadeshiko and Saito will guide me to where the others are. - Okay! - Got it. I think it'll be easier to explain with a pamphlet at hand. They can see a shrine nearby! Here's the only spot with a shrine! They're driving a white minivan. It has a Yokohama number plate, so it should stand out. I'm counting on you, Rin! Got it. Let's go. Leave it to me! "Welcome to the camping site" He's so energetic. And here are the Jomon earthenware that was excavated from this area. They're enough to fill up a large tent. Did you invite students from your new school? Yes. Everyone got along so well. Nadeshiko! Could you come over? One minute! Wow, you're really a professional. - You could say so. - Huh? Hey, Rin! Rin. Grandpa. Welcome. So you came. Yeah. It's finally done, huh? Yes. It's a good camping site. Thank you. Everyone's having fun. Yeah. This makes me happy. Right. I'm glad we did this. Hey! Shall we spend New Year's eve camping here again? That's a good idea! If we do, we should make sure not to miss the "Diamond Fuji"! What should we eat? Since it's New Year's eve, how about soba? You're joining too, right Rin? Yeah. For the time being... I'll think about it. How many years have passed since we saw this scenery? Was the future we envisioned always looked like this? I suddenly stop in place I breathe in the neverchanging air as much as I want I don't know why but I feel so full Hey, before the dawn breaks Let's talk about all kinds of things Sitting around the warm fire Let's keep talking forever Lying down on the green carpet It feels cool and comfortable Just like any other day We were laughing in excitement As each of our everyday lives overlap with one another Do you think we've all changed a little? The shadows are stretching into the dawn It's time for us to start walking Taking in the clean air, we set out gently as ever Hey, before the dawn breaks Let's talk about all kinds of things Sitting around the warm fire Let's do that again The shadows are stretching into the dawn It's time for us to start walking Taking in the clean air, we set out Let's meet again "The End"
