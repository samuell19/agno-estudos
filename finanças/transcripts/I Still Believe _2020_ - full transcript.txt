I know, I'm leaving, and you're upset and you don't know what to do. So just take a deep breath, okay? Jeremy is leaving. I know. Here. Listen to this. This is gonna cheer you up. Just like the show, right? Watch this. "Kirk to Enterprise." You try it. "Kirk to Enterprise. Hello?" Listen, I'm leaving for a while, but I want you to have this, okay? And I promise you I'm right on the other side. But that's your phone. I'll get another one. New life, new phone. - Sweet. - It's yours, buddy. I love you, okay? Okay, come on. Here we go. Let's do it. - Let's go. - Come on. - Thanks, Dad. - You got it. - Jeremy. - Yeah? Are you sure you don't wanna take the old guitar? Dad, it's yours. Yeah, I know, but you play it ten times more than I do. Dad, I'm not taking your guitar. That's your story. Let's get you to college. I love you, Mom. I love you, son. Be good. Okay, son. - Love you, Dad. - Love you. See you soon. Hey. Love you guys. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Love you. Jeremy. Come here. No way. It's a gift from all of us. How did you afford this? They took out a loan. And we all agreed to no Christmas gifts this year. We worked it out. - Sure. - Yeah. You gotta go. For me, music is a hobby. For you, it's a gift. So, go write your story. Go on. Hurry up. What would you have done if he took your old guitar? Well, I... I would've kept that one. Thank you so much. Thanks. Thank you. Welcome to Calvary Chapel College. Not a bad front yard, huh? Not bad at all. - Hi. - What's up? Wait up! Hold up. Hey, man. Uh, Norm sent me to help load in. - Norm did? - Yeah. Okay. Wait, who's Norm? Hey, man. You're Jean-Luc, right? Yeah. Are you in the crew? Jeremy. I'm Jeremy. I'm, uh... I'm a student here. I'm a freshman. I'm new. I play the guitar. Uh, cool. Dude, I love your music. You're, like, the reason I came to school here. - You're a legend. - Oh, don't know about that. Uh, anyway, I was wondering, if, uh, I could ask you some questions sometime about music? The industry, how to make it? "Make it?" Yeah. You're asking the wrong question. It's not about making it. It's about whatever our songs give people. You know? So, what do you wanna give people? - Figure that out first. - Yeah. Nice to meet you, man. Hey. Yes? Yes? Do you know how to tune a guitar? Yeah. Half a step down. ♪ Take My hand and walk where I lead ♪ Keep your eyes on Me alone ♪ Don't you say why were the old days better ♪ Just because you're scared of the unknown ♪ Take My hand and walk ♪ Take My hand and walk ♪ Take My hand and walk That was so good. Love it. Hey, kid. Guitar! - Here you go. - Thanks, man. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. - Hi. - Hi. I, um... I'm Jeremy. Melissa. "Melissa." Yep. I saw you tonight. I mean, I was watching you. "Watching?" Watched you. You were watching me? Okay. - Okay. - Melissa. I gotta go. Bye. - Well, I sing too. - Hmm? I sing. I saw you singing. Nice. Bye. A record deal two years after you graduated here. How? I just kept writing songs, man. It's all about the songs. Write what you care about, what you're afraid of. Whatever it is, it needs to be truth. Is that what you write about? The truth? Brother, I write love songs, to God. Mostly to God. Sometimes to a girl. I'm writing one right now for a girl, and this girl, man, she is... So, yeah. Write what you love, yeah? Get after it. Hasten the day. What does that mean? You know, a day with no more pain, no suffering, every tear wiped away. Our music pulls that closer. So... Hasten the day. ♪ Why it has to hurt so much ♪ Give Me all your sadness ♪ So, you actually do sing. And? And... I have pretty high standards when it comes to music, but it's good. Like, very good, or... Yeah, pretty good. Oh, just "pretty good." Yeah, pretty good. Do you write your own songs? I'm working on some stuff. Can I hear it? - Can you hear it? - Yeah. Sure, if I can read your journal. What? No. - I should get to class. - Yeah. You keep singing, Jeremy. - Camp. - Hmm? - Jeremy Camp is my full name. - Okay. Jeremy Camp. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Tonight? Oh, that depends. There's lots of stuff I could be doing, really. A lot of things. Oh, okay. Well, if you find yourself free at 8:00, I'll be at the beach, Oceanside Pier. You know, stop on by. It's a date. What? No. It's not a date. Really? Because you literally just asked me out just right over here. We'll see. Oh, yeah, and you should, um, bring your guitar as well. Okay. - It's a date. - Not a date! Not. It's a date. It's definitely a date. Oh, hey. - Hi! You showed up. - Hey. See? Told you it wasn't a date. Yeah. - Hey. Good to see you. - Hey, man. Uh, you guys... I didn't know you guys were friends. Oh, yeah. He's my best friend. No, you just keep taking my food. Well, why won't you share these? How long have you, uh, been friends for? Oh, um... Like, freshman year. I was working at Sunset Point. Right, at the restaurant. - Mmm-hmm. - And then we kind of started this, uh, tradition, I guess, here. Mmm-hmm. Oh, actually, though, you were truly my running partner - for my first year at school. - Well, not by choice. And then he decided to become a rock star and get lazy on me. Yeah. Here we are. You brought your guitar. I did. Well, you asked me to. Right, right. I did. Maybe you should, um, start us off with a song. We always start off with a song, so it would be nice... Oh, no. I'm not... No. Let's hear what you got. Come on. Hey, you guys, this is Jeremy Camp. Right? And he's going to, uh, sing for us. Except, no, I'm not going to. Please? Come on. Do you have a song that you like? All right. I guess I'm playing a song. Uh, Find Me In The River? Yeah. I love that song. All right. ♪ Find me in the river ♪ Find me on my knees ♪ I've walked Against the water ♪ Now I'm waiting if you please ♪ We've longed To see the roses ♪ But never Felt the thorns ♪ And bought our pretty crowns ♪ But never paid the price ♪ We didn't count on suffering ♪ We didn't count on pain ♪ But if the blessing's In the valley ♪ Then in the river I will wait ♪ Find me in the river ♪ Find me there ♪ Find me on my knees With my soul laid bare ♪ Even though You're gone And I'm cracked and dry ♪ Find me in the river ♪ I'm waiting here for you ♪ I'm waiting here for you ♪ I'm waiting here for you So nice. - Whoo. Hey. What are you... - Hey. What are you... What are you doing here? This is where I walk every morning. Uh... Huh. But, how did... What did... Nice view. Well, yeah. It is really nice. This is, like, my favorite place to run. Do you wanna join? Run? Yeah. I'm not really dressed. Okay. Well, bet I could beat you. I bet you couldn't. Yeah? Better give it a try, then. I'm not running. Better run. Fast! You're huffing pretty hard back there. I'm fine. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah. What's the deal with you and Jean-Luc? You guys, like, a thing? Or... Oh. It's, um... It's complicated. How so? He was my first friend here, actually. But, uh, I think this year, his feelings for me, um, have changed. And I never felt that way about him, so... So, uh, what do you feel about me? - This is last night? - Yeah. You want me to play it for you, give you a feel for the tempo? No. It's about the words. - Is there a bridge? - Yeah. It's... ♪ So you will call And I will answer ♪ Yeah ♪ I hold you All through the night ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah, you will make it All right ♪ Yeah ♪ And I will guard you Through the night ♪ Thank you. Since we're all having such a great time, I'd like to do something a little different. I have a new friend, and this friend wrote a song that I think is pretty good. And I'd like to bring him out so he can sing it right now. So please welcome my friend, Jeremy Camp! - I'm not gonna... - Go! - I'm not gonna... Melissa! - Oh, my God, go. Go, go, go! Hello, everyone. This is kind of, uh, unexpected. Um... This song is basically just, um, just a bunch of questions that I have. So... ♪ In only a moment Truth was seen ♪ Revealed this mystery ♪ The crown that showed No dignity, He wore ♪ And the King was placed ♪ For all the world To show disgrace ♪ But only beauty flowed From this place ♪ Would you take the place Of this man? ♪ Would you take the nails From His hands? ♪ Would you take the place Of this man? ♪ Would you take the nails From His hands? ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Yeah ♪ Oh ♪ Yeah ♪ Would you take the place Of this man? ♪ Would you take the nails From His hands? ♪ Would you take the place Of this man? ♪ Would you take the nails From His hands? ♪ Oh, yeah You were really amazing tonight. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. So, does this answer my question? What? You are a piece of work, you know that? And? And I made a promise that I wouldn't get distracted this year. And you're very distracting, potentially. A promise to who? God. And my sister, but mostly God. Actually, it's pretty equal between the two of them. You should meet my sister. So, I understand you now. What? You don't like to disappoint people. That's not true. Okay, it's sometimes... Okay, it's true. This is about Jean-Luc. I can't. I... I really don't wanna hurt him. So, yeah. That's why I should just never look at you again. Melissa. Okay. Permission to speak freely? Okay. What if this is destiny? What if we were supposed to meet and we were supposed to feel this way about each other, and God wants us to run towards it, not away from it? I think we wouldn't wanna miss that, right? Just promise me you'll think about it. Raj. Sleeping. Yeah? Hi. Okay. Oh. Hey. I thought about it. All night, actually. And okay. "Okay?" Yes. Okay. One date. Oh. Yep. Okay, yeah. All right. I mean, okay. Cool. Okay. Yes! It should be starting pretty soon. Here we are. This was always my favorite room when I was a little girl. You grow up around here? Mostly. What do you wanna do when you graduate? Everything. All of it, you know? But apparently, I'm supposed to choose just one thing, and I can't seem to do that. So, that's why I like to come here. The stars always seem to help. Enjoy the show. It's starting. Wow. Mmm-hmm. I love them. My dad used to take us sailing a lot, and you have not seen stars until you've seen them on the open ocean. Mmm. Do you see that right there? That little blob of light? That's right, the little blob of light. It's called Andromeda. That's the farthest thing visible to the naked eye, actually. What is it, a star? No, it's a galaxy. See, our sun is one star in the Milky Way galaxy. Do you know how many stars there are in the Milky Way? I have no clue. Three hundred billion. Yeah. Right. And Andromeda is a galaxy with one trillion stars. They all shine together. So, that, my new friend, is the definition of wonder. God is so infinitely vast, and this is His painting. We paint with brushes, He paints with a billion stars and a trillion galaxies. And He knows my name. The God of a trillion stars knows my name. And He has a destiny just for me. And I'm gonna figure it out, someday. So that's how I see the world, and myself in it. What are you thinking? That I've never met anyone like you before. Well, I'm just one star in an infinite galaxy. Some stars shine brighter than others. - This is you, right? - No, that's not me. - You sure? - Nope. No, no, no. Shh. It's late! You're gonna wake people up. This is me. This is me. - Okay. - This is me. Um... So, Friday night? Yes. But, um, could we just keep it between us right now at first, you know? - Yeah. No, of course. Of course. - Right? I'm great at keeping secrets. Oh, I'm great at keeping secrets too. Great. It's a secret, then. Total secret. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, sis. So, I met someone. Joshua Tree. Perfect album. No way. I think I have it. His name is Jeremy. Jeremy Camp. He plays music. I love his songs. It's so good. Right. So, how do you play this? Okay, Prince? And I don't know, there's something about him. That is the dryer. You may wanna start with the washer. Right. But we're just gonna get to know each other. That's it. What? - I mean, come on. - That was amazing. Favorite place? Ocean. Definitely ocean. Community service. When you realize that life is bigger than you. - You grow when you see... - I don't care. Mr. Camp. Hmm? Yes? You wanna come back to Earth? Honestly, not really. Aw. You got a little girlfriend? So cute. No, really. It's really, really cute. - All right, you guys... - Sorry. ...sign-ups are in the back. What's this? Right now, it's just a blank tape. Mmm-mmm. Tapes have soul. Why are you giving this to me? Well, our record label's paying for a new album. So I called the engineer. He's a friend of mine. If we hustle, we'll have an extra couple of hours. I can get you in there, and we can turn that into your demo. - No. - Two songs, maybe three. I'll send it off to some producers. I don't know what to say. Are you serious? Yeah. That's amazing. - That's... - Very cool. - You're invited too. - Hmm? - Yeah. - Oh, no. I don't need to go... No, no, no. Forget that. Forget that. I want you there. I don't wanna go. I have a song that I'd like to play for you. - It'll be fun. - Oh. Um, I don't think that's a... Hey, look, can I talk to Melissa for a minute? Yeah, yeah, sure. - Uh... Oh, okay. - I'll call you later. Yeah. I'll, uh, - see you later? - Yeah. - Yep. Bye. - Bye. You were out there for a long time. Did he ask you out? Sort of. Okay. And? Doesn't this all just bother you? Yeah, of course it bothers me, Melissa. You should just tell him. I can't tell him. I... Are you wearing his jacket? Yeah. You're wearing Jean-Luc's jacket? Yes. He gave it to me. He said I didn't have enough clothes. And I actually really like it. Wow. This is just... I, I... I really cannot look at you in the jacket. He gave me the jacket. It's not like I took it from him. Maybe... Maybe we should just rethink all of this. Rethink what, us dating? See, now you're mad and everyone seems to be mad. I'm not mad. Jeremy! - He's right there. - Hi! Hey! Is this your girlfriend? - Perfect. - Josh! So, how long you two been dating? Um... It's... Not like that. Yeah. We're just trying to get to know each other. He's really told us all about you, - like a broken record. - Mom. - Jeremy. - What? I love Melissa. Jeremy has a girlfriend! Josh, that's enough. Come on. Eat your food. Jeremy has a... Jared, shut up. Okay, you're walking really fast. - Why are you so mad? - I'm not mad. Really? 'Cause you seem mad to me. Maybe it's because you're embarrassed by your family, and I don't get that. I wasn't embarrassed by them. So, you're embarrassed by me, then? I'm embarrassed by the fact that you don't want anyone to know that we're dating. It's... It's awkward. What are we doing here? What do you even want? Give Jean-Luc his jacket back. Oh, my gosh. ♪ This is my desire ♪ This is my return ♪ This is my desire ♪ To be used by You ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ This is my desire ♪ To be used by You ♪ Yeah How was that? Really great. Look who it is. Look who's here. When did you write that? Uh, last night. After a conversation with a friend. All right, everyone. Let's take five. Gonna go work on something, but I'll see you in a bit. Can you hear me? Do you wanna come in here? - Hey. - Hey. That was a really nice song. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Um... I've been learning a new song, just the chorus. Oh. - Can I play it to you? - Sure. ♪ I love you I love you, I love you ♪ I love you, I love you I love you ♪ Is that about God? Not entirely. Melissa. Yeah? I love you. Mmm. I don't think that I'm ready for that. Um... Oh. Jean-Luc! Hey, hey. I'm so sorry. I did not want any of that to happen. I just... Dude, let me explain. Don't bother. There's nothing to explain. Hear me out. Dude, I wanted to tell you, I just didn't know what to say. The truth. You should've just told me the truth. Melissa, you... - Hi. - Hi. Um, can I come in? I... I don't think that's a good idea. This is for you. It's, uh... It's another journal. I figure, after what I've done, you could use a lot more pages. Mmm. Wait. I'm sorry that happened. Obviously. But I'm also kind of relieved. Relieved? Yeah. I don't even know what that means. I am not relieved. I don't think Jean-Luc is relieved. Okay. "Relieved" isn't the right word. I'm happy that this is not a secret anymore. I didn't wanna hurt him, okay? So, I'm sorry, I just really don't wanna see you right now. Hold on. What are you saying? We're breaking up? Call it what you want. Why, I call it breaking up. Okay. Then I don't wanna see you for a while. Hello? Kirk to Enterprise. Hey, buddy. It's almost Christmas. I'm coming home. I miss you. I miss you too. We put up the Christmas tree. Yeah? Thank you. All right. Hey, Mom. Merry Christmas. Son. Hmm? How are things with Melissa? Jeremy has a girlfriend? No, buddy. Jeremy doesn't. Hello? Jeremy. Jeremy. There's a call for you. Some guy with the name Jean-Luc. Sounds important. Jean-Luc? Sorry to just call. I didn't know if you'd heard. Heard what? Melissa's sick. Well, is everything okay? Jeremy, it's pretty bad. You should get here. Jeremy, there's a map on the seat. You sure this is okay? Yeah, fine. Go. Just be careful. It's a long drive. Call us when you get there. Yeah. Hi. Uh, I'm here to see Melissa Henning. I'm a friend of hers. Hey. Hey. - You're Jeremy, right? - Yeah. Okay. Hi. We're Melissa's family. She's told us all about you. Nice to meet you. Hi. You must be Heather. Mmm-hmm. Big sis. Uh, how is she? She's awake. Yeah. And I'm sure she'd love to see you. - Come on. - Yeah. Hey. Look who I found. Hi. Hi. When did you get here? Last night. I drove. You drove? From Indiana? Yeah. Huh. You know what? Let's... Let's give them a minute, okay? So, um, what's going on? Um... They... They removed a, um, tumor the size of an orange from my stomach, tested it, and it turns out it's Stage 3C cancer, whatever that means. And, um, it spread to my liver. So, the truth is, the odds are not altogether in my favor. Melissa, I'm so sorry. Don't be. It's okay. I'm okay. Somehow. I mean, I can't really describe it. It's, like, warm, like a blanket. I've been listening to this Ginny Owens song, If You Want Me To. Do you know it? Yeah. I just keep thinking, maybe God has chosen something bigger for me, something I wouldn't have chosen for myself. But to be honest with you, I am so scared. But I have to believe there's a reason. If one person's life is changed by what I go through, it will all be worth it. Look, man. I should've told you. Yeah. Yeah, you should've told me. It took me a while, but I see it now, you two. Oh, man. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I mean, I wanna be there for her and I wanna help. I don't even really know what we are, you know? How she feels about me. We've talked about it, but if she really is that sick, it's just hard to know what's ahead. There's only one question you need to answer. Can you live without her? God, if she tells me she loves me... This is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. - Hi. - Hey. You came back. These are for you. Oh. They're so beautiful. Thank you. Yeah. I thought I'd add to the collection you got. You kept that. Oh, yeah. I've been using it for a while, actually. I never got to say thank you. Still, uh... Still can't read it? No, you cannot read it. Will you, um... Could you just help... Could you just help me up for a second? Yes. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. There we go. There we go. This is... Okay. This is... What I'm about to say is gonna be... Might be weird. Could be weird. - All right. - Um... Okay, uh, so, I... Well, uh, the other day, when you came by, it just, uh... It just really... It meant a lot to me. After you left, I had this feeling, like God wanted me to pray for you. Okay. And for your wife. - My wife? - Yeah. Is that weird? - I'm not sure yet. - Okay. So, I started praying, and then the more I prayed, the more I realized, I love you. I love you. Mmm. I... I love you. I do. And you don't have to say anything back. - I just really felt... - Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Yeah? - Uh, um... Can you just, uh... Just wait here for one minute? Just a minute. I'll be right back. Just wait here. I'll be right back. Okay. Yeah. Just, uh, don't move. - I can't move. - I'll be right back. That wasn't really a minute. I think you said "minute," right? Oh, yeah, no. I'm sorry. Yeah. It was, for sure, like, a while. - Keep them closed. - Okay. Open. What? How did you... That's why it took me so long. Yeah. I wanted to bring the galaxy to you. I want you to know that whatever this is, and wherever it takes us, that I'm with you. Every step, every moment, I'm with you. I'm in. I'm so in. And, um... And, you know, I figure if we're gonna get married, we have a lot to talk about. - Married? - Yeah. I love you. I love you, I do, madly. So marry me. And I know relationships need to be prayed about, and you can take as much time as you need. But that's why I brought you here... Yes. Yes. Yeah, I'll marry you. I'll marry you. Yes. Married? You're gonna marry her? But will she get better? I... I don't know. Son, you're only 20 years old. You just met this girl. I love her, Dad. And that's wonderful, but... Look, look, look. Why don't you just... Just slow down, take a little more time, you know? Go one step at a time here. Dad, I'm supposed to be with her. I can't explain it. I just... I know that. And I don't want it to just be her story and my story. I want it to be our story. I know you're worried, and I get it. But... I'm gonna marry this girl. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks. We made some breakfast. Wanna have some? Yeah. Sure. I brought you something. I want you to have this. Mom. My mom wore it her whole life till my wedding day, and I've never taken it off since. Are you sure? Of course. I just want her to feel welcome. When you go. Are you sure about this? Melissa, I love you. And I believe God is gonna heal you. Our life starts now. Thank you. We've all heard his hit single climbing the charts, but tonight, he's coming at you with something brand-new. Please welcome Jeremy Camp. - It's a good song. - Thanks, man. Thank you. Thanks, Jean-Luc. He's a legend. Uh, my name is Jeremy Camp and tonight I'm gonna play you an original song called Right Here. ♪ All the world is watching ♪ All the world does care ♪ Even when the world Weighs on my shoulder now ♪ These feelings I can bear ♪ I know that You're here ♪ Everywhere I go I know You're not far away ♪ You're right here ♪ You're right here ♪ Everywhere I go I know You're not far away ♪ You're right here ♪ You're right here ♪ All these thoughts I've wasted ♪ All these thoughts I've feared ♪ Even when these thoughts have faded ♪ I still know that You're here ♪ And my hope is in You I love you. ♪ Everywhere I go I know You're not far away ♪ You're right here ♪ You're right here ♪ Everywhere I go I know You're not far away ♪ You're right here ♪ You're right here I want to introduce you guys to someone special tonight. This is my fiancee, Melissa. Go ahead and stand up, babe. Come on. Stand up. I know, I'm taken. I'm sorry. Earlier this year, we had some tough news, some really tough news. I've never seen a faith like yours, babe. It's a beacon for me. It's a beacon for everyone who knows you. It reminds me of a story. There was a woman who was sick for a long time, a really long time. But she had this... This total faith that if she could just touch Jesus, just touch his clothes, that she would be healed. And that's exactly what she did. She broke through the crowd, and with everything that she had, she reached for Him. Just like I see you do at every single concert, Melissa, reaching out in faith, touching heaven. Can we do something special for the most special person in my life tonight? Can we pray for her? Because I believe that God still heals. - You guys agree? - Yeah! Yes. Anyone who's sitting around her, why don't you go ahead and lay a hand on her. If not, just put your hands in the air. God, heal the love of my life. Heal her tonight. Melissa, your hair isn't what makes you beautiful. Hey. Um... Why don't you go take a walk or something? This is kind of a big deal for her. - Okay. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... No, no, no. It's okay. Just, you know... All right. Yeah. You know, she's... Um, she's living at home now. I'm just helping take care of her. And I just think that, um... That school can wait. Right now, this is the only thing that matters to me. So, I'll be a semester, maybe more. Well, son, that's noble. But I wonder, is it really wise? Well, it's, uh... It's what's necessary, sir. So, even after the chemotherapy, we're seeing growth in your scan. I'm seeing them on your ovaries. And I'm sorry, but you're going to need a hysterectomy. I know that this is a serious decision, but I recommend that it be done very soon. How soon? In the next week, two at the most. Our doctors are extremely skilled, and the risks are low. Wait. Are you telling me that I'm not gonna be able to have children? I'm afraid so. Hey. It's okay. No, no, it's not. I love kids. You're so good with kids. Melissa, it's my professional opinion that this is absolutely necessary, given your condition and what we're seeing on the tests. Well, then run more tests, please. Just run more tests. We've run them all. And they're very conclusive. Mmm. Want me to make you something? No, I got it. - Here. Let me do it. - No, no. It's okay. I need a second. Oh! Oh, no. Oh, God. Hey. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, okay. I just can't... Welcome back to The Fish, Los Angeles, and we have a great young artist in the studio with us today, Jeremy Camp. Yes. And Jeremy's gonna do some songs live for us in just a minute. But first, Jeremy, you have some pretty big news you wanted to share with us? I do, yeah. First off, thank you so much for having me. Um, for everyone listening, my fiancee's name is Melissa. Uh, she has a huge surgery coming up this week, and it's really serious. And basically, she needs a miracle. So I just wanted to ask everyone listening, if you could just stop what you're doing and pray. I'll do the playing. You guys do the praying. Thank you. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. I, uh... I stopped by the radio station, and it's like the whole city's praying. Dude, these letters are pouring in from everywhere. No way. I thought you'd want to have them. Hang in there. Thanks, man. Can I sit with you? Yeah. It's so weird seeing her here. She's always been the strong one. Yeah. I'm really glad that in the midst of all of this, someone is choosing her, someone really special. Thank you for giving her a chance... Jeremy! Jeremy! Yeah. Mmm. Hey. Jeremy. Your cancer, it's gone. They didn't go through with the surgery. You're cancer-free. And that is the story you're gonna tell our kids one day. You know what you are? If anyone here has ever wondered if miracles still happen, or if God still heals, then I wanna introduce you to the most beautiful girl in this room. You're a miracle. That's what you are. It's unbelievable. I spoke to the doctor myself. There is literally no medical explanation, none whatsoever. That is awesome. For everyone listening out there, on positive, encouraging K-LOVE, she's 100% cancer-free. Amen. Yes, she is. I will love you, cherish you, honor you, every moment of every day without hesitation and never looking back. I'll encourage you, lift you up, I'll be your muse and your anchor. I'll be the love of your life and your biggest fan. Until death do we part. Nope, past that. I will love you past that. Son, you may kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, - Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Camp. - Aw. Through the storm and out the other side. Can you believe it? Mmm-mmm. Thank you, Jeremy Camp. I think I would have died without you. I would have been lost and alone at sea. God sent you to save me. Melissa Camp. I like the sound of that. - Ready? - Yeah. - Okay. One, two, three. - ...two, three. What did you wish for? I wrote down some names... Names I've been dreaming of. - Family? - Mmm-hmm. I've got a surprise for you tomorrow. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. Phew. That's, uh, so strange. What? Oh, uh... I don't know. You've never been sailing and I'm the one who gets sick. ♪ Will I believe You ♪ When You say ♪ That Your hand will guide me In every way ♪ Walk by me Jeremy. Hey. Hey. Something's wrong. Something is really wrong. Hey. How does it feel? - Jeremy. - Hey. Wanna come in? No. Actually, let's talk out here. So, what's going on? She's having a little pain, feeling bloated. Liss, hey. I'm sure it's fine. The cancer's come back. It's spreading rapidly. It's all over her body. Okay. What does that mean? That means we have to have another surgery? No. No more surgeries. What? Chemo then? No. We're stopping treatments. There's nothing else we can do. I'm afraid to say she only has a few weeks, a couple months at the most. I'm so sorry, Jeremy. I'll be right back. Okay. This should help with the pain. Squirt. Clamp. Swab. Okay. We got this. We got this. Is there a concert I didn't know about? Not a great turnout, Jeremy Camp. No. I just wanted you to see it. See what? Where it happened for me. This is where I was standing. Right here, when I fell in love with you. Come on. "Fell in love?" - On the first night? - Yeah. You were sitting right there. The girl who sat there seems so far away now. I feel like a shadow of her. On our first date, you said, "Some stars "shine brighter than others." You know the stars that shine the brightest? The ones with the shortest life. And when they die, they explode in a supernova. It's... It's the most beautiful thing. Color and light all mixed together, God's painting. The death of a single star outshines everything else in the galaxy. Melissa. What if I'm not supposed to be healed? No, don't. Don't. Don't say that. I want you to promise me something. I want you to find someone else. Don't. Don't. You're going to be healed. I promise you that. Jeremy. Would you just stop? Stop making promises that aren't yours to make. Jeez. Did I forget the dose? It hurts. It hurts. So bad. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Melissa. No. You're not okay. - Come on. - No. I'm okay. We're going to the hospital. Come on. Help! Somebody help! Somebody help! Nurse, we're gonna need a wheelchair! When's the last time you slept? Go home. Get some rest. Go shower. - We got this. - I can't. Just get a few hours. Come on. Go home. She is my home. Hey. Hey.

I think I'm okay. Babe, lie down, lie down. I'll get the doctor. You have to believe me. Just believe me. I'm okay. Okay. I'm gonna get the doctor. Excuse me, can I get a doctor for my wife? Okay. Slow down. What's the issue? Dr. Furst, Melissa's awake. Someone help! Someone help! I love you. She's with Jesus. No. I didn't get to say goodbye. I'm Tom Camp. I'm looking for my son, Jeremy. Mr. Camp. He's still in the room. Get some sleep. See you in the morning. Mom and I will have breakfast ready for you when you get up. Dad? Can I ask you a question? Anything. I remember I prayed and prayed in this room for Josh to be born healthy. It didn't happen. And you prayed for so long for your ministry. Still nothing. Dad, I begged God to heal Melissa. What am I supposed to do with that? Are you asking if Josh's disabilities were disappointing? Yes, they are. Did I have big dreams that didn't come true? Sure. Do I understand why Melissa isn't here anymore? No, son, I don't. I'm sorry. But I know my life is full. I feel rich, and I'm proud of this family. Honestly, at the time, I didn't agree with what you did. I didn't understand it. You chose willingly to walk into the fire with her. Right beside her, all the way to the end. But then, that's exactly what I would do for your mom and you boys. That's what love is. And I got to watch my son do that. For his wife. That was a privilege. I don't know the answers to your questions. But I do know this, that my life is not full in spite of the disappointments. It's full because of them. I'm proud of you. I love you, Dad. Jeremy. I'm healed. I think I'm healed. It's God. You know the stars that shine the brightest? The ones with the shortest life. You're going to be healed. I need a doctor! I promise you. It doesn't hurt anymore. I can't feel it. You were right. You have to believe... Why did You do this? Jeremy. I know you'll find this someday. See? I'm finally letting you read my journal. And I've thought a lot about the day I realized I loved you. Remember? I just watched you there, awestruck by your gift. Knowing God would use it someday to touch the world. I felt that day the same way I do now. You're asleep on my shoulder right now. I guess one of the benefits of the pain is that it's hard to sleep. Which means I have a lot of time to think. And I've thought a lot about the stories you love to tell at your concerts. You're so good at it. Ancient stories, still relevant and true. In one story, God grants healing. Miracles do happen. Yet to another, His call is to suffer, and even die. And I realized something, they both have value. Because each is a chapter in a bigger story. Each is the stroke of a brush on His beautiful canvas. Each is the light of one star helping to form a galaxy. And I think I'm one of those lucky people meant to experience both. I had my miracle. It led to the perfect day with you. It was enough. I've learned that suffering doesn't destroy faith, it refines it. And God is worth trusting. Even when we can't see. I'm safe in His arms going bravely into the light with a peace that I can't understand. So, do one thing for me, Jeremy Camp, for my sake. For the sake of your gift and everyone meant to hear it. When you're ready, pick up your guitar. And now, we have an artist with his first gold record with five number one hit singles. He has a story to tell. Let's welcome my friend Jeremy Camp. What's going on, guys? My name is Jeremy Camp. Uh... A few years ago, I met a girl named Melissa, and she is, and always will be, the love of my life. Melissa died with this incomprehensible, selfless faith. She was always reaching for heaven. And I believe she finally touched it. I believe she finally touched it, and she had to tell me that there would be another day, with no more pain, with no more tears, with no more sorrow, another day where I would get to see her again. I know I'm not the only one hurting here today. She told me that if just one person's life was changed by her story, then it would've all been worth it. Just one. So, this one's for her. ♪ I still believe In Your faithfulness ♪ I still believe in Your truth ♪ I still believe In Your holy word ♪ Even when I don't see I still believe ♪ Though the questions Fog up my mind ♪ With promises I still seem to bear ♪ Even when answers Slowly unwind ♪ It's my heart I see You prepare ♪ But it's now that I feel ♪ Your grace fall like rain ♪ From every fingertip ♪ Washing away my pain ♪ Yeah ♪ I still believe In Your holy word ♪ Even when I don't see I still believe ♪ I still believe ♪ I still believe ♪ Oh ♪ I still believe in You ♪ I still believe Jeremy. Uh, you don't, uh, know me. I feel like I knew her, your wife. Melissa. I was there the night that you prayed over her. We were the next band. I'd just gotten in from South Africa and I was, uh, going through a really hard time. And I honestly was trapped in this web of, like, apathy and disappointment. I had lost someone close to me. I was angry and hurt and... I thought the world was full of hypocrites and I was the worst of them. I guess I just wanted to know that God was real, somewhere in the universe, like, to a person. An actual person in an actual, meaningful way. And I looked at her, your wife, that night. She was, like, glowing with something I've never had. Her story and your story, it... It rescued me. I'm the one whose life was changed. And there will be millions more. I just wanted you to know that. Thank you. It means a lot. Hey. What's your name, again? Adrienne. You were right. I've never seen stars like this before. I love you, Melissa. And I'm gonna tell your story. I feel very protective of Jeremy and Melissa's story, I think, because of how much the Lord did in my life. That it was something that I needed to hear. God was telling me to pick my guitar up, and I'm like, "The last I wanna do is pick my guitar up." I remember feeling the presence of God so thick in that room. Like, just, like, I needed that. Right what came out was just, "Okay. I still believe." Literally. Like, "I still believe in You." That's what I wanted to say. This is something that God gave me as a gift to heal me, and I believe that God was gonna use it to heal many people.
