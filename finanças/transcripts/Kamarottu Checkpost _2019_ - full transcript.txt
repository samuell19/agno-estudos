Huh That security guy is not alive What ? No Sanath, lets leave Maybe there is any link to this soul and the incidents of our house...

Sonu... what happened dear ? Show to me Disambiguation and illusion... It is how we think Actually illusion is depended on our strong belief Some may be seen, in presence, it can be truth or false There will be no clarity, because Behind every incident there has to be a strong reason Sanath, whom did you meet first, after coming here ? First that Gaddappa, then the check post security And the shopkeeper Gaddappa.... Hmmm sounds interesting Can you arrange to meet him ? Leave it madam, he is like a mysterious comedian No use of him There will be some mysterious character in every person It depends on how we see He can be an important twist to our problems There is a reason Gaddappa was somewhere in the road, And he was found near the house the day Bhoomika and Sowmya arrived... Like this we have to enquire each and everything For no reason if you trouble anyone, then you will be stuck here There is wrong... there is wrong... You all have committed sin I will not tell but do... Go from here Or else I have to show you who I am Is the soul, reason who the incidents here ? There is not only one soul here, How my friend is living here with so many problems ? Your friend Pradeep has to answer this Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... What Gaddappa ?

All are upset since we are here... Someone has invited for the traditional festival of this place It is celebrated grandly... If we go there, we may have a change Yes, good idea Sorry, you all proceed... I cannot come Because I have some observations What is he telling ? He is telling that there is problem in your house It is better to leave the house soon God has told that, no need to fear God?s grace is on you We will leave Sanath, I need to talk to you, come here Hmmm When will your friend Pradeep come back ? He said he will be back in 2 days, probably tomorrow Here there is problem When was the last call from Pradeep saying that he wants to speak about this problem? Almost it?s been 5 days Gaddappa... From the time I started investing, all the clues and doubts are indicating you At least now tell us, what the relation between you and this house is Sanath came here from Bangalore The same day, everyone from here went there And what is the relation for the security guy and this problem ? You said Pradeep will be coming tomorrow or day after tomorrow But the reality is, he is already present here Yes, as a soul... he is a spirit I knew you were a good Psychic, but not as story teller Please don?t make fun with my friend Phone line is not connected, then for so many days...? I have seen sanath talking to Pradeep Did you speak to him ? No, Then to whom did I speak for so many days ? Mr. Sanath.... Sometimes you have to accept the reality Only then you can come out from the risks Then what about Preetham and Nandini ? Gaddappa, will you speak out now ? I was working here for few days here Both the Sir and Madam were very good One day night, I was working outside the house Sir came late that day Both were fighting I couldn't know why they were fighting, as I was far I went near to the playing child Then they came outside fighting He took the playing child and went from there Madam was requesting a lot, but sir didn?t stop After some time, phone ring After talking in phone, madam went inside the room She was trying to hang herself, I stopped her but she didn't listen to me Finally she hanged herself Then she died... From then on, mysterious things started to happen here For this reason, no one was coming here This is not an old story nor a lie This is the truth I saw myself Sanath, do you know anything personal of Pradeep Because sometime some truth are buried with the people Do you know anything like that ? Not that kind of deep personal We have shared few things Since 6 months he came here, our meetings and conversations turned less Then, he called and said that he wants to speak about some problems Then I came here, I know nothing more than this Hey! You are lying I will not tell you, till you say the truth You are responsible for everything Just go from here, don?t trouble the kids Nothing to worry She needs some rest Make her sleep After this there is indication of a death Not only here, wherever you go this will follow you Why is that Pradeep creating problems to you ? What is the reason ? Why is he so angry ? Looks like you are hiding something Madam... I told you everything Sanath, I have told you already that only after knowing everything, solutions can be give But I am not getting the excepted answer from you So my case is in middle I am really sorry, I am leaving back tomorrow Madam... Sanath... Sanath... wake up Wake up quickly... Yes baby... Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky Sonu, whom are you talking with ? I am talking with Preetham Do you know how good he is? His dad had scolded him for talking with me So he said he will not come to talk to me anymore You too shouldn?t go to play with him again Ok?? Hmmm Is it ok ? Ok Come I didn?t know, it will lead so far Anyways, tomorrow morning will leave from here Good night Sanath Hmmm Sanath wake up... Get up and get ready... let?s leave... Sanath... Bhoomika... Hey It?s horrible... It has killed very horribly I didn't know this will happen... Sanath, you are the reason for this After analyzing the case deeply, all the clues were against you I questioned you a lot, but you have not answered me Maybe that Gaddappa knew all the answers Maybe so the spirit had killed him Madam, I forgot to tell you one more thing After Pradeep getting settled in Kamarottu, we haven't met Four months ago, Nandini had called me That day... Baby... One minute Hello Happy Birthday to you... Thanks Nandini, you are the first one to wish I am grateful to have yours and Pradeep's friendship I and pradeep are very happy I am too grateful to have Pradeep in my life But I needed a good friend like you to make it understand I need to thank you a lot Sanath... One minute... Ha sure Bala... I will throw a party for you all in the morning Sure... thanks... thank you so much... Ok I will do bye... Hello... hello... That?s all madam... I know nothing more than this I don't know why Pradeep is so angry on me If you had told this earlier, we could had a better solution Spirits come close to the one who is weak mentally Many times spirits will be around us, we can even know it As we get a small clue, we should never forget our beliefs Only when we forget ourselves, spirits occupy our body Like this, we would be responsible for many incidents Now what I am going to say may shock you You know what it is ? Sonu can see spirits Sonu, is there anyone here other than us ? Hmmm So now I am going to time travel that is going to past To see the things happened on the same time Only my body would be here Till I come back, no should move from here So let?s get ready Hello Hello... is this Nandini ?

I am writing this on greeting cards about my love on you I will give these cards to you, only when you will say I Love You to me Pradeep found the greeting card which nandini had written to Sanath Pradeep is doubtful on Nandini?s behavior I will not spare... I will not spare anyone who has cheated me I will not spare anyone in this house Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to dear Sanath... Happy birthday to you... Thanks Nandini, you are the one to wish me first I am grateful to have yours and Pradeep?s friendship Sanath, I and pradeep are very happy I am too grateful to have Pradeep in my life But I needed a good friend like you to make it understand I need to thank you a lot Sanath... if you had accepted my love proposal that day... then we both Husband and wife... and a child for us... I had doubt on you, when you burnt these Your relation had gone to greeting card isn?t it... What are you doing dear...? Enough... enough... don't lie anymore If you had told me that you don't like me It would have been fine... He cheated taking advantage saying to that he is doing favor for love And you are living with me lying the whole time This is not called as family, it is called prostitution Good bye...

I have not done anything wrong Please understand me... where are you going with the child ? Please Pradeep... listen to me... Please Pradeep Please understand me... don?t leave me alone Don't go... I only called Sanath to the house he gave, where Nandini died I wanted to torture and kill him Till then you came and spoiled everything Pradeep, nothing like that had happened You have mistaken He is a cheat... I have to kill him Do whatever you can... No Pradeep... leave me... Leave me... Sanath, Pradeep's soul can attack you any time Be careful Is he naming the friendship has affair ? Let him kill me...
