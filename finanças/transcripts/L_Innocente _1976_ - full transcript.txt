THE INNOCENT - Very good, Mr. Hermil - Thank you. - Your carriage is here, Sir Hermil - Thanks. We'll continue tomorrow... I'm sorry... - It's late, I must go. - Alright. Until tomorrow. - Goodbye - Goodbye Ready? On guard - I don't understand... What were you were saying? I said that for me it's a myth that English men are cold... It's pure invention. - Really? - You seem to be very knowledgeable about it. Good evening He said no, right away. Isn't Ms Sperati singing tonight? - No, next Tuesday - That's a pity, I won't be there - They say she's admirable. - As a singer or as a woman? I know nothing about opera. If our Princess knew how few of her guests come for the music. She knows it very well. It's her way of inflicting penance for our sins. You come here to court Countess Teresa Raffo, you get 1 Mozart, 2 Schubert and 4 Liszt as penance. Good evening Countess. Good evening. - Pity you've arrived so late. - It's my fault, Princess, only mine. I have no doubt. - You've missed a Mozart and a beautiful Liszt. - I'm sorry. Come and sit near me. She plays Chopin extremely well Come along darling. I wanted to thank you, Princess. I'm afraid I have to leave. It's a pity you're leaving so soon. She is an extraordinary pianist. Yes, I think so too. Goodbye Where are you going? I don't want to stay here if you're with her. - I didn't know you would come - Yes, I know Farewell. Enjoy yourself. - Teresa, please - Are you leaving with me? I can't, don't you understand? You come out with me now, or this is the last time you ever see me... The last time, and I speak seriously Beloved Tullio You wouldn't allow the most beautiful of our guests to leave, would you? It is not up to me, Prince. My evening does not end here. Will you tell Count Egano that I am waiting for him? I will, Countess. It's fine, here he is. My dear Stefano! I want to leave early Come, Tullio Let's go in before that fanatic starts another piece. My wife gets offended if I'm not in the room. After all, it takes so little to please her. - I'll come for you later. - What? No, I will send the carriage. I won't be back. I'm not feeling well. - I'll come with you. - Don't complicate matters. I will see you later. Come in. As you can see I know you quite well. I was sure you'd come. I chose to wait for you, before going out again rather than risking finding you here when I got back. Give me back my keys. Be reasonable. I couldn't leave with you. For once my wife asked me to accompany her to her best friend's concert. Why didn't you tell me you'd be there? I went because I knew you'd be there. It's time we faced this situation. Don't you agree? For months, the charmer that you are, has skillfully succeeded in preventing me from seeing how things really were. - So I took the initiative. - Initiative? Seeing what? That I am married? You always knew that. - Of course. - So? But from what you say the relationship with your wife is only a formal one. - Exactly. - That's not true. And it's obvious when you're together. You're just like all the bourgeois husbands in this world, my dear They swear to their lovers that they've rejected their wives and tell their wives they don't have a lover. I won't accept such pettiness. I am a free, liberated woman and I act accordingly. Just like you. Are you jealous of her? I won't share a man with another woman. Not even with his wife. You are not sharing me and you know that. All I think of is you. You're part of me. I feel your presence constantly, it's persistent. Even hostile. I'm going out with Egano... You go to your wife. Leave me. No, I won't leave you. You're staying with me. You're still awake? You said that you weren't well... How silly of me, I was worried I waited by the window for your return. Do you know what I was doing? I was writing to you But since you're here... Tomorrow I leave for Florence, I don't know how long for. This time it's serious, I had to tell you You're leaving forever? Well, forever is such a big word Listen, Giuliana, even though... I've never spoken to you about it, I'm sure that, at some stage some compassionate souls must have informed you of my infidelities. I didn't tell you myself because they were insignificant affairs and because of the pact we agreed to when we got married. Love is only there while it lasts then it's replaced by respect, affection friendship, common interests... If all that is possible, of course. And I assume that it is our case since you've peacefully accepted the situation between us for quite some time. As you said, they were insignificant affairs. That's why I tried to ignore them, - For me, marriage... - Yes, our marriage had... to be protected at all costs. Correct? And you are right. You've been wonderful. Even if my love for you... has faded... as it inevitably happens, the affection and respect I have for you have only increased. I'm fond of you and respect you... like... like a beloved sister without whom I could no longer live. Of course, you have every right to leave me... but I will suffer greatly if you abandon me. Will you stay with me and help me? How? In what sense? By tolerating me... You'd help me to face a situation... which according to our society's standards... would surely be criticised - The woman I now love - Teresa Raffo Yes, Teresa - She is a widow, she's free. So what prevents you from going with her, if that's what you want? I said I love her but I didn't mention marrying her. She's a sensual woman. Beautiful. I desire her. No woman has ever succeeded in seducing me... like she does. What is this? I arrive and they leave? Anyone home? Federico - Tullio - Federico I have three days leave and you all leave? No, only me. - Lucky that you're here. - Where are you going? Truly... How many days off have you got? Three, three and half, to be precise. Listen...I... I am in a lot of trouble... or misfortune, if you prefer... I'm leaving Giuliana by herself. I don't want to impose but I'd feel better knowing you're with her. Wait. I'd like to spend my three days in Rome but not with my sister-in-law - She's adorable, but... - No, do as you please. I only need to know you're around. I mean, if before going out... You could just visit her and say hi tell her your plans for the evening. Giuliana will be happy. This is a very delicate time for her. Very delicate. Does anyone else live here? The house looks so big. Enlighten our friend, or she'll be disappointed. I promised to show her one of Rome's finest homes... But I'm not saying it isn't... It's beautiful... But... No, it's not. This villa was built for my mother. She wanted lots of greenery, even in the city. My father did his best to please her, but... when he died, she returned to Badiola, the house in the country... where it's much greener. Then my brother got married and came to live here with his wife. I kept these three rooms, to be more independent. So it's not the main house. Yes, it is. I assure you. Federico! Federico! Giuliana, what happened? What's wrong? Giuliana, come on! Giuliana. That's it. Help me. - Call the governess. - Right away, sir. She didn't faint. She took something. Are you alone in the house? No. No. They've already gone to bed. I was too... Forgive me. I was depressed and took something to help me sleep. But instead of relaxing I became terribly anxious... Terribly afraid. I didn't want to stay alone. - I'm here, how are you feeling? - It's nothing, such a silly thing. - Do you feel better now? - Yes. I'm sorry to bother you. Lie down a bit longer. This is Filippo D'Arborio, the writer. See what important friends I have? Ulderico Guinigi and Miss Elviretta, my sister-in-law Giuliana - Hello. - My apologies. I ruined your dinner. Please continue. You mustn't be alone this evening. Come on. Tell us when you're ready for bed. Or sleep here. You'll be lulled by our voices. - When we were boarders... - You went to school together? Where? I was poor. My parents couldn't afford my studies. I paid my way by tutoring younger pupils. Federico was one of them. And I always fell asleep. That's right. He'd fall asleep as soon as I started talking. He says the tone of my voice is to blame. I'd be very pleased if now... you managed to sleep too. Breakfast is served. What a beautiful scent. Are they tuberoses? At this time of year! How did you find them? You're so sweet. I'm here and I shall wait. Stefano Egano How dare he? The idiot! You shouldn't read other people's letters You are being silly... If I wanted to be with him, I wouldn't be with you now. I promised Egano I would see his horses race at Cascine but instead I am here with you So what are you complaining about? I was hoping to see you at the race yesterday. My horses won prizes. There are too many people, I'm afraid of crowds. They're racing in the steeplechase tomorrow. I have entered two horses. I can get you seats at the finishing line. I'm afraid that won't be possible for me In case you change your mind... I can assure you the Countess won't change her mind - I'd like her to tell me herself - I'm telling you. If you change your mind I'm at your disposal. Very well. Egano's friends say that he has returned to Rome. And so has she, apparently. She has broken up with Tullio. You have done well to come. Let the tongues wag. Don't let them pity you. Never accept the role of the betrayed and abandoned wife. You are here to disprove that. I hoped to be here on time to tell you not to come because Teresa's coming. But my train was late. He's come back. Did you know about his duel? And while I fought with some idiot in Florence, she left. I must see her again. She's treacherous, elusive and a liar. The moment you think she's all yours, she escapes She's already pursuing other desires. I must find the strength to break it off with her. And you must help me. - What can I do? - I don't know. Many things. Convince me not to see her again. Nobody can convince you, least of all, me. That's not true, you see... the most dangerous thing for me is that my frustration is making me feel so unhappy. But at the same time I feel alive, awake... It's the first time I'm in such a situation. It's true... One can sell his soul in exchange for youth and then finds himself unconditionally in love, with no defence. You talk as if I never existed You're right, I'm being unfair. I'm sorry. Be patient with me. As you would be with a sick person. Someone who indulges in his own illness. - Was it you singing? - Yes - Are you going out? - Yes. - Where are you going? - To Di-Castro's auction. I can't pin my veil. Will you help me, please? Do you have a new perfume? What is that? Crab-apple. It's an English perfume. 'The Flame' 'To Giuliana Hermil, my 'Ivory Tower' I humbly dedicate my book. Filippo D'Arborio' - Aren't you going out? - Do you know D'Arborio? Yes When did you meet him? When your brother was here. - Have you read it? - Yes, I skimmed through it at the Club. A mediocre writer, don't you agree? No His style is so pompous, so emphatic. It's quite unbearable How can you say that? He has an extraordinary style. It's enchanting, just like music. You cannot judge an artist like him having read only a few pages at the Club. You take it to heart! He may be a great writer but he's ill-mannered. You must give me that. His inscription is not only emphatic but also uncalled for, if one considers it's addressed to a lady he only met once. I saw him again after our first meeting. Are you taking the carriage? No, I'd rather walk. See you later. Now as you've all seen 4500 Liras and 4500 Liras twice. Congratulations Countess Raffo. Thanks. Now there's a fabulous dove-shaped pin in pink diamonds and rubies Value estimated at 5000 or 6000. I'll start at 1000. 1000, 1100, 1400, 1600... 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200 for the Lady 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, 3000... 3000, 3500 at the back. 4000 right at the front, 4500 for the Lady 5000 here. I feel the room heating up Good evening, Mr. Hermil. 6000, going 6000... 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, this is welcome 8000, 8500, 9500, 10000 over there 10100, 11000 Selling at 11000 going once, going twice.. sold! Now for auction a beautiful fashionable bracelet, practically new...with more than one hundred diamonds and sapphires, mounted in platinum Estimated 10000. Start with 1000 1000 Liras, 2000 Liras - Good evening Madam - Good evening Emilio - Is Mr Tullio in? - No, Madam, he went out. Tell the kitchen I've already eaten. - Good night - Good night, Madam I've spent endless nights outside here, looking up at your windows. I know, I saw you once. And you didn't call me? Why are you so cruel to me? You are one of those men who make women suffer. You're selfish. Proud. Despotic. A domineering lover. If you knew how hard it's been to resist calling you. But I succeeded. And you had to come looking for me today. But I didn't come looking for you today... I went there by chance. - That's not true - It is, I swear. I haven't left the house for days on end. My wife said she was going to the auction, so... Your wife was there? She wasn't there, I assure you I had nothing to do today either so I got there early. And I'm usually late wherever I go. I saw every single person who walked in. Oh God, I'm ruined. So your wife lies to you. Perhaps she has a lover. I'm sorry. I'm only joking. I only saw those who were already there. I didn't see the people who arrived later. I didn't even see you. - Good evening, Sir - Is my wife back? Yes, an hour ago, but she left again. She went to catch the 8:30 pm train. She said that she was going to visit your mother. I believe she left you a note in the study. Sir Hermil I'll be with you shortly. You're the only punctual man in Rome. Let me introduce you to Mr Filippo D'Arborio. - I'm Tullio Hermil. - D'Arborio Shall we do a sparring match? - Yes, with pleasure. - Please. Blades in line. Salute Mask... Gentlemen, on guard Gentlemen, start I'd like your opinion... Who would you like next to you at the table? On your right the Princess of Fondi. And on your left? It's up to you. - Do you like that book? - No I do, very much. I also like the author. I invited him this evening, but he is not in Rome D'Arborio? He'll get in touch as soon as he gets back. I'll organise another dinner. I'd like you to meet him. - I've met him, thank you - What's wrong with you? - Are you in a bad mood? - Not at all Then, will you approve my seating arrangements? Don't forget we must give the Dampierres an answer by tonight. What are you saying? Are we going to Paris or not? You're the one who's been invited. I'll go if you come too. What else do you want to do? D'Arborio's dinner, trips... You're a bachelor again... and so... and I'm taking advantage of it. I am sitting here the Ambassador on my right, and I've put Dampierre on my left. - Is this all right? - Yes, it is. I have put Dampierre next to me. So I can tell him we'll be going to Paris next week. All right. Thank you. Tullio! - How are you, Giuseppe? - Well, thanks - Tullio, my dear Tullio. - Mother, how are you? You are all alike, you arrive all at once when we least expect you - How's Giuliana? - She was hoping to see you too. Come. Come. - Elvira, where's Madam Giuliana? - In the garden Go and tell her Mr Tullio is here. Yes, my lady. How does Giuliana spend her days? - Well, luckily she has some friends, so... - Friends? Her friends from Rome are staying with the Torrigiani. Giuliana says that they are likeable persons. At least she keeps herself occupied. I never go out, I never see anyone. I told her to invite whoever she wants but she doesn't want to disturb me so she'd rather go out. It will be a beautiful surprise for her to find you here Here's Giuliana. - You look very well - I wasn't expecting you. To be honest, I wasn't planning on coming. I was already at the station, with a ticket for Paris. But then I saw a train to here and changed my plans. I knew that Tullio was a little crazy, but not to this point. Wait Do you mind if we occupy a room in the left wing too? Tullio reads at night and I wake up very early. So we'd rather have separate rooms. As you wish, there are plenty of rooms. Take those to the left wing please - Would you like some? - No, thanks Thanks Did you go to Villa Lilla? - No, I haven't. - Why is that? - I haven't been there. We will have to speak about Villa Lilla... There's a former English diplomat, who fell in love with it and who'd like to buy it. We could sell it at an excellent price. I'm against selling it but we could rent it. With all the money we spent to renovate it. When you were newlyweds, you said you'd spend six months a year there. I never believed you. If we rent it we would cover the maintenance expenses, at least Uninhabited houses deteriorate before their time. Well, think about it. It's not for the money. To me, it will always be your home. Mother is right, we should at least go and see it. If you're free tomorrow, we'll go to Villa Lilla. Welcome Sir Tullio. Welcome Madam. Hello, Callisto Give a drink to the horses and some hay. I've been airing the house for the last fifteen days. I knew you were at the Badiola. I've been waiting for the weather to improve. Very good Sir. You should listen to your mother and rent it. Yes, it would be the most reasonable thing to do. The English diplomat would look after it well. But the idea upsets me. Doesn't it upset you? You seem just as hesitant and fearful as you did when we came here for the first time. The same flowers were blooming. The same scent. Yes, it was the same season Let's try to be two new people... who meet here for the first time. It's up to us to try. If we do not succeed we sink back into unhappiness and misery. It's not possible, don't torment me Why not? You've been my wife, my sister but you've never been my mistress. It's different, you know. Very different. No embarrassment, no false modesty. No holding back. Love is all this. Especially all this. And I have never taught you. It's my fault. I was wrong. Tell me that you want to make love with me, Tell me you want to. Ask me. Ask me, ask me my love. I was getting worried, I wanted to send someone. How are you? - Well. - You want me to accompany you? - No, thanks Hello, mother Giuliana is not well, I wanted to sleep at Villa Lilla but she did not want to - She is ill? - Nothing serious... a light malaise, perhaps she has caught a cold. You're so right. It's a shame to leave Villa Lilla empty. But no English diplomats. We'll go and live there, at least some months of the year - But... - Yes, I know you don't believe me But you'll see. It was so beautiful there today... The smell of the lilacs... Maybe that's why Giulana got ill. It was a such a heady perfume. I'll tell her to stay in bed. It would be wiser. And I'll call the doctor. I wanted him to come last week, but Giuliana refused. Tell Giuseppe to take the carriage and go to Dr Milani. I'd be most grateful if he came tonight. Calm, calm, mother, you are exaggerating. Giuliana is fine It was nothing serious. There's no need to worry. Giuliana forbid me to tell you until she was sure. But, as there's no doubt now, So I'll tell you... so you won't be as silly as you were today by taking her out in the carriage. Giuliana is pregnant. - Pregnant? - Yes - She told you? - No, no... I worked it out. She has had many malaises, like today. Nausea, dizzy spells, you know. So I asked her and she said she hoped she was. But she wanted to be sure before telling you She didn't want to disappoint you, of course. I've begged her so many times to see the doctor because she won't listen to my advice. I've told her to look after herself but she won't listen. She should be in her third month. But don't betray me. Wait for her to tell you She made me promise. I am so happy! I have yearned for this moment! Now she must be careful. The first months are the most dangerous for her most of all. She's so frail our dear, dear child. Goodnight mother. I'm going upstairs so if she wakes up I'll hear her. You'll wait for the doctor? If Giuseppe had found him, he'd be here by now. - If you need anything - No, thanks, goodnight. Tullio... Don't leave. I'm afraid of being alone. What have you taken? A sleeping pill? Tullio. Have you slept here all night? - What happened? - You asked me not to leave you alone. I did? When? You do not remember? No. I took a sleeping pill. Maybe I took more than usual. Since when do you take sleeping pills? Does the doctor know? Yes Show me what you take. I don't remember where I put it. Wait I think... I must have finished it, and thrown out the bottle. Is what my mother told me true? That you're pregnant? Yes, it's true. I wanted to tell you. I tried to yesterday at Villa Lilla. Is that why you left Rome? Yes. But I didn't know then. - And he followed you. - Followed me? Who? It was all over before I came here. Before I knew that I was... like this I had found the strength to overcome my confusion. I was very lonely. Very sad. I'm not justifying myself or accusing you. I'm desperate. Desperate. But I come last. What about you? The same right applied to you as to me. We were two friends, two free people. You could too. It wasn't to claim a right. I never felt I had one. I swore eternal fidelity to you, in front of God. It was different for you. But for me... There is one thing that I want to know And it is uniquely important I'm no longer interested in our past life together. But I've changed a lot in these last few days. - And yesterday at Villa Lilla - No, please. No, let me finish. Yesterday I found you again. And I believed you'd like to start from scratch. For a moment I felt that all I'd been through was nothing but a dream, a nightmare. It was you and I, like when we just got married Are you being sincere? Nobody must suspect anything, understand? Why? Do you want me to stay with you? Yes Seeing you're awake... I came all the way here to tell you that I am enrolled in the international championship I need some lessons. So I won't discredit the family. - Coming down? - I'll be with you right away. - Hello, Giuliana - Hello, Federico Touché, Bravo Why don't you take my place in the championship? You still fence beautifully I'll make more of an effort now. Ready? Careful, boys. Don't hurt yourselves. Stop it. What are you doing? Are you crazy? We're off the board. I want a return match. Not now, I am tired That's enough boys. The doctor is with Giuliana. If you want to talk to him, you'd better see him. All is good But he wants Giuliana to stay in bed a few days. It's safer. Anyway, he'll tell you. Go up. No, I am sweating. I want to change. I'd keep him waiting. Apologise for me. It's no use pretending I don't know anything. As you can imagine, mother told me already I am really happy. That way she'll stop nagging me to marry. The heir is guaranteed. Congratulations May I congratulate Giuliana too? No, leave it for now. Better Mother had kept quiet. Giuliana is not well She may lose the child But the doctor said... Didn't you hear? Even last time Giuliana got pregnant... soon after we got married, the doctor said everything was fine but it wasn't. If you leave abruptly... without the doctor's consent, my mother would be so upset. So you'd better stay a few more days. I'll go to Rome to make arrangements with Dr Magli. I'll have to give him some details. How many months ahead are you? I finished the second one a few days ago. I don't think there's any danger at this stage... if one takes the necessary precautions. I don't understand. You're not thinking of keeping it, are you? Last time you lost it through natural causes and this will help cover up for this one. I'm referring to the family who know you're pregnant. I know what to say to Dr Magli. But I can't. - What can't you? - I can't. Why not? Are you afraid or don't you want to? I can't because it's a crime. A crime. How could you think that I...? But you're quite happy to give my name and my family's affection to a stranger Isn't that a crime? Why won't you answer me? I said that I want to help you. I love you and I bear no grudge for what you have done. I am grateful to you, very grateful, but... But what? You have said it's all over. That you want to put it behind you. So it's not true. Because if it were so, how could you and I... Yes, I admit it's impossible. I must leave you. It's over between us. Listen, Giuliana, the real crime is the one you want to commit. First you torment yourself with remorse but then you forgive yourself from that sin and torment yourself about the consequences and the absolution is a life sentence... but not only for you. Can't you see how absurd your behaviour is? I am an atheist. But that doesn't mean I don't have moral problems. On the contrary, I'm aware of the consequences. Because God doesn't decide what's right or wrong for me I assume my responsibilities. You see, I know that my sins if I've committed any can't be redeemed through repentance or by punishment. I am a free man Earth is my only country. I have no other destination. My story begins and ends here. I don't have a hell to fear or a heaven to hope for. I believe we can only count on ourselves. What I'm proposing isn't an easy way out. My solution faces the truth of existence. It doesn't seek refuge in faith or in a god created by our imagination who, in another life, grants rewards or penances. If I could think like you... have your self-assurance... You could live your life freely, to the fullest... without fear. Think it over carefully. It's entirely up to you. I'll go to Rome to make the arrangements. You'll join me as soon as possible. I need a favour. You must let me meet your friend Filippo D'Arborio Do I have to come to Rome for that? Send him an invitation. He'll be delighted to come. We're good friends. Besides, he'll rush here to see Giuliana again. They met one evening at my house and he was love struck. I don't even want to tell you how much I teased him. I don't want to invite him. I want to... It must be a chance meeting. You invite him and I'll just turn up. It is a delicate matter which I cannot explain to you It's also my fault. We didn't expect you in this heat. And since the house needed a thorough cleaning including the carpets So I thought... Put the house in order. My wife will be arriving next week. - Who is in the house? - The cook, Virginia, Alfredo... Any further orders, sir? What is that? Ah yes, I need someone to deliver a letter. I will send the coachman or I can go myself, if you like. You may leave. I'll call when I'm ready. Well? I'd have joined you, as I said in my letter. Not even for a moment I thought that you'd return so soon. You're contradicting yourself. You knew I would. In fact today you sent your butler to my home, not to Paris. I hadn't heard from you, so before leaving... Did you expect me to believe that you'd join me in Paris? No. You see? I did well to come here. Contrary to common belief I believe truth is never said to one's face. There are too many factors which intervene in our intimacy, so... one usually ends up not understanding anything. Understanding what? That you're over it, my dear. Quickly, in fact. Very quickly. It's not pleasant for a woman to be abandoned. There are those ready to pity her and I don't want that. There are those who question her charm and I don't want that either. You sent me a note when I was already on the train saying that you had serious family matters. Oh, come on now! Not even a mere clerk would resort to that. I really believed a catastrophe had occurred. I wanted to go to Paris, yes, to have fun. And when I arrived there, I didn't even unpack. I came straight back thinking that if you had such serious problems, you might want me by your side. My friends will surely laugh when I tell them the story of my fall. What are you saying? Shall we still dine together? As you wish No compliments. Please, Teresa... You're the only person in the world to whom I may tell my story one day. I hope that this will be our last day. Good Evening Here Thank you Thank you Here. Let's go Thank you Good evening. Excuse me. My brother Federico. Countess Raffo Countess. Osvaldo said you were here. I'm terribly upset about, I mean, rather... I looked into that matter but couldn't find my friend. I last saw him before going to camp. I didn't even know he'd gone to Africa. In Africa, to do what? Right now he's in hospital in the isolation ward. His condition is very serious. A disease he caught there. Perhaps, Countess, you know this friend of mine too. Filippo D'Arborio, the writer. We've met. I am one of his admirers I've been told he's between life and death. The truth is that they know nothing about tropical diseases, and they don't know how to treat him. Too much sad news this evening I am sorry to be the bearer of this. I'm truly sorry. Drop in to see me when you get home. I'm staying out late. Nevermind, I'll wait. Very well. Good night. You know what? I'm suffering less than I thought. One day I might listen to what you have to say. What's wrong? - Nothing - What do you mean? - Nothing. - The door was open. You told me to come at any hour. Ah yes, I wanted... I wanted to know which hospital D'Arborio is in. In the Policlinico, in quarantine. No one is allowed near him. Now you must tell me what you want from him. When you asked to meet him I thought you suspected something between D'Arborio and Teresa Raffo. It's plausible... since all the ladies in Rome are in love with him. Besides, your lovely Teresa Raffo, no offence meant, of course, isn't the type to refuse a flirt. But no, I found out they barely know each other. You saw it yourself. She didn't know he was ill. And so? What are all these mysteries? I can't tell you anything It's an issue that concerns a friend. Well, I'm going to bed. It's dawn. Can you at least tell me when he left for Africa? I'll find out, but tell your friend to leave him in peace. D'Arborio is ill, very ill. He is a man who deserves respect He is not only a great writer but an angel as well He's the only person who makes me feel ashamed... or almost. Why? If you think about it, you might realise why. We're intelligent, we've studied. We've travelled. We enjoy ourselves so much, we're so rich... and then? - What's all this nonsense? - I don't know. Goodnight. At what time are we going to the Club? You owe me a return match. I don't know. I don't know what will happen tomorrow. - It depends - Goodnight Good morning. Mrs. Giuliana sent me to get her lighter clothes. It's hot at the Badiola now too. Didn't she say she was coming to Rome? No, Sir. I'm sorry, I almost forgot. It's from Madam Giuliana. I also have to do a few things for your mother. I hope I'll be able to leave tonight. If you have any orders... No, it's Ok. I'll get there before you. I can't do what you asked. I'd rather leave. Get out of your life. I can't commit a crime. - I spoke to... - To whom? With my confessor. Did he tell you to leave? No, but he agrees. I hope that my family will give the child their name. And why not its father's? No, he must never know. Do you really mean that? Do you realise what will happen if you leave me? It's not the scandal I'm worried about. But your situation as a single mother Who, to save her child deprives it of a father. If I were sure that your decisions stemmed only from your moral and religious convictions If I felt you were mine and mine alone I could stand anything. Children belong to whoever educates and raises them. FILIPPO D'ARBORIO IS DEAD Maria, did my wife call? No, Sir, but she asked me to wake her at 9 o'clock. Wait a minute. You can go. May I? Good morning, Madam. It's 9 o'clock. Come in. I have been up for a while. Good morning What's the weather like? It's sunny. Have you seen it? FILIPPO D'ARBORIO IS DEAD I was told in Rome that he was seriously sick. I told you, right? How strange. I would have sworn I told you about it. A tropical disease he contracted in Africa. Why won't you look at me? What are you thinking? Why torture yourself? Here is the doctor I'll show him in. - Good evening Doctor. - Good evening. Is the midwife here? Yes she is. This way, Doctor. - Is the doctor here? - I'm here. - Come quickly. - I have something to tell you. And I'll do so in the presence of my mother. Last time you examined my wife you said we may be faced with a choice. Let it be clear, and I take full responsibility that, should this unfortunate situation arise we want the mother saved. I sincerely hope... that we won't be faced with this choice. But I'm grateful to you for taking full responsibility. - As you know, the Catholic religion... - I know. It's an immoral and criminal precept. But it doesn't concern me. Come doctor. Breathe Good, long breaths. Another long push. Very good, very good. Mr. Tullio! Mr. Tullio! Mr. Tullio! Mr. Tullio Here's is your boy. He's already opened his eyes. They're both safe and sound. We made it. Congratulations, he's a beautiful baby. All has gone well, Sir Tullio. You may go in now to see Mrs Giuliana but do not let anybody else enter the room. She's going through some brief crisis. She's well but very weak. It is nothing, do not worry. Yes, she's had a strange psychological reaction. She won't see the child. She's crying. Isn't he beautiful? God bless him. Raimondo. Grandma's Raimondo. Isn't he the world's most beautiful baby? Look at his eyes. Please don't cry in front of your uncle, treasure. He's so good. He just eats and sleeps. Look at his hands. He'll be tall. Isn't he gorgeous? He's just like all other babies. I can only tell foals apart. - You should see Zara's - What? He's a splendid silvery grey. But babies... You're just saying that to make me angry. What do you know about babies? When you were born you were ugly, red and wrinkled. You weren't like him. He's beautiful. Tell this to Tullio instead of being silly You must say: Tullio your son is a little ray of sunshine. - Must I be the one? - Yes Nurse, shut the windows. It's cold today. - Right away Madam. - Today is not a nice day. Are you scared I'll say to Tullio and Giuliana the foal is better? Don't worry, Mother. I'll tell them I've never seen such beauty and that I'll be proud to be his godfather. What's wrong? You joke about it. But I am desperate. Desperate. What are you saying? You have no idea! I'm not upset with Giuliana. Even the doctor said... ...it's a reaction to stress. But your brother... So strange! Before he was worried for her, and that's understandable, but now that all has gone well they never see the child. As if he didn't exist. They don't even mention him. The only thing your brother told me is if we want a baptism, it must be private. No reception, nothing. You scared me for a moment! Is that it? You know that Tullio isn't religious. He has his own ideas. We'll celebrate some other time. - Is that what upsets you? - Yes, a lot. And above all they keep to their room, by themselves. They're hostile. But no, this is good news We won't have to bother with the party and Tullio and Giuliana are so in love they forget they have a son. Perk up, all will go well Tullio will come into church... as he did for his wedding. Right? And Raimondo? Is it decided? Will they call him that? Your crazy husband is really upsetting Mother You shouldn't have come to church and hide in a corner I asked mother and nurse to join us for some champagne to calm her down. It's champagne, not holy water! Come in. Oh! Good, come, come No, not here, in the other room. Giuliana mustn't get tired. You may go. Let's go, Federico. Do you really not want us here? Why don't you come? The doctor said you can move a bit. I think it would do you good. Come on, make an effort. - Hurry up Federico - For me Go, go. I'll see you later. Let's have a nice Christmas to please mother too. Try to come up with something. Do not count on me, I won't be here Really, you're not staying for the festivities? Mother said that... I am sorry to disappoint her but I have changed my mind. I can't make it I'm sorry but I don't like the atmosphere here. I love you all, but I have my problems too. And I want to spend my holidays in peace. I will celebrate elsewhere. Has he eaten? I hoped to find him awake. Will he be warm enough? His little hands feel cold. Shall we put his mittens on? No, no, Madam, do not worry He's nice and warm. Don't worry. He won't wake up. It is soothing for children to hear our voices... knowing they're not alone. You go to bed too Nurse, goodnight Goodnight, Madam. I've been watching you cuddle him at night. Go during daylight. Why don't you tell the world how much you love him? Don't lie. Have the courage to speak the truth. I went in because I thought someone called. It has happened before. It's like they're calling me to tell me something is wrong. That's not true. I've seen you sneak out in the dark before. Trying not to make noise. What's wrong with that? You do the same thing. Nurse told me. It's true, it's true. But it's not the same thing. I try to discover your secret by watching you I try to force myself to forget but I can't, I can't. And I damn the day I accepted this torture. And you've changed. You're happy now. That's why I can't stop looking at him. And you don't care that I'm suffering. You love him. And by loving him, you're loving his father. You know that's not true. I even wanted him to die when he was born. It's awful but it's true. His presence distresses me, too. Yes, I despise him... ...for the pain he's causing you. I can't see you like this. Why do you not believe me? I swear I despise him. Is that what you think? Yes, because he has come between us. I would like you and I to... Take me away. We will be happy away from here. We'll leave after Christmas. I promise. Mother is waiting downstairs. We're going to mass. - Your cape, Madam. - Fine. I will wait for to you here Won't you wear my present? It does not seem the right event, it is too opulent. Nonsense. It pleases the peasants.. ...to see their masters well dressed. The bells have already rung twice Madam! We must hurry. It's Ok. Good evening. Good evening. Nanny, you can go to mass if you want. I'll stay here. Thank you, Sir Tullio. I will go. The baby is fast asleep anyway. Goodnight, Sir. Tullio. Merry Christmas Goodnight. Giuseppe, serve supper immediately. Of course, Madam... Immediately Yet another Christmas has passed And we'll be leaving. You promised After Christmas. When are we leaving? Whenever you want, tomorrow if you want. Madam! What is it? Come. The child isn't breathing. My God! Doctor, quick. He's not breathing! He's not breathing! He's not breathing! He's not breathing anymore Doctor. Oh my God, my God, my God! I don't want to. I do not want you to go in there Why not? Stay with me, I am so afraid. Come with me. Come with me. Mr. Hermil, Mr. Hermil! No! It can't be! It can't be! Is he dead? Yes Get off, get off me, don't touch me! I am not your accomplice. Be quiet, Giuliana, I beg you. I beg you. - You did it - Quiet. You knew all along. It's your fault! I hate you. No, you said you hated him. No, I wanted to save him from you. I did my utmost to save him. But what are you saying? Yes, everything I did with you was to save him. Only to save him. Now, for the rest of my days I will have to live with this mark on my soul. My God, help me! May you be as unhappy as I am, Tullio. You're lying to yourself. You've always wanted him to die. Listen to me, not even for a moment... ...did I want to get rid of him. Because I loved him, my poor baby... I only pretended to hate him. You must know that so you'll understand it's truly over. I loved and always will love that baby's father. To the end of my days, I can but hate you. Hate you. And despise you. Women have the extraordinary capacity to adapt the reality to the romantic ideals of the worst literature. My wife's adventure with Filippo D'Arborio lasted... but a fleeting moment. Just like many of your friends who fell for the fashionable scribe who had the misfortune to contract a disease which sent him back to his maker. That's all. I'm only sorry that I helped to contribute elements to this appalling second rate novel. You don't really believe that you caused the death of that innocent? You see, it's strange.. But newborn babies have an extraordinary resistance. The cold didn't kill it. So don't feel any remorse. He must have died because... No, that does not have any importance As far as I'm concerned it's the intention that counts. And there are no doubts about my intentions. I knew with full clarity what I was doing. I feel no remorse and I'm not justifying myself. I'm not touched by man's justice because... no court on Earth would sit in judgement on me. Have I bored you? Sorry. It's still early. We can still spend some time together. That would give me great pleasure. I like your home. I've tried to picture it so many times, but never succeeded. It's strange, you know, because it resembles you. It really does. - With all your beauty. - And my ugliness. What is there that's ugly? I want you to tell me. There's no rush. I have to look carefully... and think about it. - Will you offer me a drink? - Of course. So? Have you decided? What is there in me that's ugly? Now I'll tell you. Let me drink first. I shouldn't. I drank a lot at dinner. But you've plunged me... into such melancholy. Let's do it in order. You asked me before what I thought about what you told me Now I'll tell you. I believe you're even more in love with your wife. So much in love that you're pitiful. That's not true. I admit that my last experiences with her have been intoxicating. Both murky and morbid, if you like. Only the pure ones are capable of such excess Think of the life of ascetics. You're in love with her. And for the first time you feel defeated. Your two rivals cannot be vanquished because they're dead. Poor Tullio. What nonsense are you saying? If there's a loser in this mournful story it's my wife. She, who has decided to live among the ghosts of the graveyards, instead of living her life freely. And who obstinately refuses to believe that our problems should be solved here on earth and not in a hypothetical afterlife. I instead am here with myself Without illusions, without regrets. The day I no longer have a taste for life... feel no curiosity... I would end it all. Those are the things one says. But there comes a time when one ceases to live and begins merely to exist. But we don't realise it and we are unfortunate enough to do so, our hopes turn to eternal life. That is not my case, I swear. What do you know? You're always so sure of yourself. But no one knows what the future holds. Not even you. Less than a year ago you spent your nights beneath my windows crazy with desire and jealousy. And I committed all kinds of follies to smother my love for you. I wonder why you men raise us up with one hand and drag us down with the other. Why won't you let us walk by your side? As one being next to another? A woman next to a man. Nothing more, nothing less Of course if I decided to live by your side... Live by my side? But I don't love you anymore, my darling. You are a monster. Not because of what you've told me tonight. After all, that's just the natural conclusion to everything. You are the most attractive man I ever held in my arms. But, if one day I became aware that I am in control of my life. I wouldn't want to feel unworthy of it. Now leave me alone Tullio. What would happen if I slept here? Are you tired? Maybe I had too much to drink. Don't sleep. I beg you. Impossible. I'm tired. Do not sleep, please. I want to show you my conclusion.
