Moshav (village), Nahalal, 1947. Palestine under the British mandate. Escaped after the World War II disaster victims and refugees from all over Europe come to the shores of Palestine. The confrontation between Jews and Arabs, as well as with neighboring countries intensified. In this situation UN prepares to decide the fate of Israel. How do you feel? Good. How do you? What is it? Letter. His mother sent me. What does she say? "Margalit, dear! In the barracks the air, as well as at the grave - grief and sorrow. Oh that I had died instead of Ely. Not awarded I see you happy together. Why Eli did not deserve this - build a kibbutz on the hill and around it, on thousands of dunams of land in which he had invested so much work. How much mental strength he has spent on the purchase of each dunams. All my blood revolts, screaming and crying. I'm not better than any mother who lost children, skorblyu repeatedly and I can not be comforted. You, my dear, We need a strong support. Life takes care of it, time will help you, and to the end of my days I will keep the emotional connection with you, no matter what your future life. Be well, my dear, write to me. Rachel." An Israeli Love Story Monodrama inspired by Pnina Gary Based on a true story Nahalal 1947 Much more? No, it's - the last the banks that remained. All these? It's not that much. When you're done, go to the store, they will soon be closed. Mom, we have agreed with Michalik. Half an hour later the bus comes and we go! Your theater svol you mad at all. Hanna Rovina - only one and that's enough. I finish these 3 banks, and I go into the shower. If you ask for something, it appears! You did not see what I did. What... where the girls? In Haifa. In Haifa? What do you have in Haifa? We're going to play. What are you saying? Culture? Very nice, Dudik. Michalik. It - Margalit. Hi. -Hello. It's - Eli. -Hello. -Hello. Where are you from? We are from Jerusalem, but now we are in Kibbutz Beit Keshet. In Beit Keshet? It is near us. Alon, my causin, live there. -Alon Ben Avi? Yes. Can not be! I otkolochu it. Why did he say anything about you, huh? What a selfish, huh? What performance you watch? "Oedipus Rex". You know? No, I do not know. I would like to, but... Barely have time to breathe. Where are you going? -Well... go. This is the secret. You can't open. -Nice to meet you. Bye. -Bye. You could not ask them where they were going. They're from the Palmach (Jewish self-defense), and may not speak much. Closed cash, no tickets. I told you... It can not be. Let's go home. Margalit? What? Come on, let's go. "His hand. Only those who have seen the case, all the bitterness of his heart felt. But all, because my memory is subject, sufferer will tell you a lot. Do you remember how in a frenzy of grief she dashed off. From the porch she threw his marriage tower..." Where is Rovina? Shhh... It's not Rovina. -"... hands gripping in his hair... "- It's - a slave. "Bloody pupils are not rare drop of dark brown water, and black hail bleeding, face and beard sufferer irrigated..." Well, go on, go to him, well... Nahum? Pardon? Well, Shoshi... I just wanted to say that the cost to come from Nahalal... Many thanks! -We are under the impression... Many thanks. From Nahalal -Yes. My name is Margalit. Margalit. Very nice. Nahum. -Very nice. You can write to me... the album? -Of course. Please please. From Nahalal to "Oedipus Rex"? Long road. We give you the performance, in Beth-Haem. True, but... we had a trip and we missed, so... My friend and I decided to come. -And... very good! You can... -Sure, with pleasure. Beautiful album. I see you tried very hard. You're very fond of our world. Can I ask you something? Of course. I'm sure that many are turning to you. I want to be an actress, I want to learn, is this my dream and... -Well, with the appearance you have no problems. We have a studio in Tel Aviv, and we will organize exams in the near future. Come on, try it. -Nahum, are you going? Everyone is waiting... Oh, I'm on my way! I have to go. Do not worry, come to Tel Aviv, I'll take care of you. Many thanks. -It's my pleasure. Ah, you're here! Good morning! -Good morning! Hi, Leiser, how are you? -Thanks. Margalit. Want to go? Drink something? -No thanks! Thanks! Uzi, I want to ask you something. Listen, I organize representation of youth and... really I want you to be involved. With youth? I'm not a little adult? But you - the best! You - the most talented! And I need someone who will be a leader... I do not have enough guys... -Margalit, Margalit, it is not necessary at this time. Now it is very difficult period. Read. What is it? Who wrote? You? Me? Uzi, look what's written here. It is Shlyonsky! I'm awfully like it. I dont know. Are you sure you want this, who you can not trust? I need you! See, my friends, it's like... in the word "bottle". In the word "bottle" already have a sound opening cork and poured the liquid, is heard: "bu-tyl". This is called onomatopoeia "onomatopoeia". -"It is", what? In Greek. And this - the power of these poems - in the sounds, in the definition, in the rhythm. Words imitate the clatter of the wheels of the train and... create a sense of motion. So when you say the words, think not only about their meaning, but also the sound. Uzi start. "Phew, I'm tired" - puffing steam locomotive, teeth chattering and squeaking. Down with the silence! Down with the silence! And hrom?haet ta-ta-ta, and repeat the track: tu-ta-ta." "Tu-ta-ta" - what is it? Heavy? We just listen to the words of today. Too late. Record the box. Here. -Oh, Margalit, I just close. Leave the tray. I'll write. Well, my mother gave, that there are still 2 trays, but I'll get them tomorrow. -Good. -Thanks! Guys, I'm sorry, the only person who can help you, return only tomorrow morning. What? There is no one else who could help? Hello, Eli. -Hello. Do you remember me? Bus to Haifa? -And, of course, "Oedipus Rex". I'm Margalit. Eli. -Eli, too. I know. What we have to be stuck here all night? No problem, stay the night here. One can sleep with me. -Yes, and the other is for me, for us. The sit is here. Thanks! -What do you say? You go with her, and I'll go with him. It's all homemade. Bread baked Margalit. You are obliged to try the cheese. It's me. Very tasty. We in the army, in Russia, when given soup, we had to go all out to blow, to drive away the flies that flew on top of... Say, so where do you live now? In Beit Keshet. A Beit Keshet not far from us. What does the name "Beit Keshet"? Rainbow in the cloud? No, no, it's from the Tanakh. Father suggested the name: "To teach the sons of Judah the bow", a book Shmuel. Right, it is important and should be taught to our children of the bow, so that we can defend ourselves. I'll will lay. I see that you are tired a bit. -Thanks. I suggest you try our honey. How? The taste is excellent! In fact, honey is special, exceptional. You know, bee venom contains a medicinal substance, for patients with rheumatism. Indeed? -Yes... I was a child was ill with rheumatism. When I was in Russia, in our group was an agronomist. It was he who pushed me to the breeding of bees. And he offered me while working with hives open back for a bite. It literally saved me! You know, before I was almost paralyzed. He could not move his hands. The first time I hear that. We even have a friend, a Bedouin, Adele, that comes for the honey and stings. I made your bed. Here's a towel. Mom, I'm going to show him where he would sleep. Come on, our old hut - outside. Thank you very much for your hospitality. I'm not hungry. Good night. -Good night. -Good night. This is an old barracks, where we lived until he built a house. It is a little bit small, but... -It's okay. Thanks. Maybe you want a cup of tea? Not bad idea. What? -Well? He asked for tea. I'm waiting for you. Mother. Margalit, you have forgotten here a few. What happened to you? Sorry, Mom, I'm a little scattered today. Then you will go to help his father in the barn. I can not now. I've got something. Then afterwards. Good morning! -Good morning, Michalik. How are you? -In order. Help is needed? -No, thank you, all right. You want me to take it? -No, I do now, I'll be right there. Have you got some time? Can you come to me? No, I am busy. But, listen, I have to tell you something. Well? What? What? You remember those guys who rode with us on the bus to Haifa? That guy, Eli? -Well? He spent the night with us yesterday. We, in Moshav? -No, we have in the barracks. You have in the barracks? How? I dont know. I... I went out and when she saw him near the garage. Him and another guy. Their jeep broke down. What are you saying! The moment that happened something? -No, Silly. What could happen? He was exhausted. He went and spoke little, ate, and, then I sat on the bed, eyes closed, and he... Okay, calm down, calm down. You all burn! Do you want to drink? Take rest second. Mom and Dad, he has already passed the exam. He laughed at the flies that flew in the soup? Wow! Caution! Good morning, Yossi! Sabah Al Yousuf Khayyr! Good morning, Adele! Good morning, Kolodny. -How are you? Came Kolodny and Adele. Let's go. All! All! Pretty. "The Palestinian issue is entering a new phase..." Margalit, come here, there is a place... How are you? -Good. -Hello. Margalit, one can ask you something? I began to teach the material for submission, it's hard to... I know. Why did you chose this poem? The fact that Shlyonsky wrote it a long time, Train, train bind me with what happened in Europe with the Jews. Shh, young people, you are interfering. Sorry. -Sorry. "It is reported that Syria use the teachings of 10.000 soldiers, and weapons includes guns, armored personnel carriers and tanks." Well, let's climb. We have to gather more volunteers. Where are we going? In the kibbutz. -In what a kibbutz? What's the difference? Soon you will understand everything. Hello everybody! -Hi! I 'm Yard. I'm responsible for you at the time of the operation. What operation? -I do not know. Soon after dark, here's to come ship with illegal immigrants. They arrive here after long wanderings through Europe. We asked you to come to help us, the Palmach, take them when they sail, so that the British did not find them. Go. Follow me. Margalit. What? He's here. It's not him. It's him. It's not him! It's him. I'll go to him... Give, give... let's go... Hello, Eli. Do you remember me? Peace narrow. We came to help. Well, can you bring us a blanket? Blankets? And... I... I do not know where they are. You see there? There's a girl called Yard. Ask her. Good. -Thanks. Come on, give, give. Id?mte, id?mte. That night, they will spend the night in the kibbutz, Tomorrow we have to send them. Excuse me? -Yes? Do you know where I can get a blanket? A Margalit! Exactly what I was looking for. No, I brought them, he asked me to... Everything is good. People were shaking from the cold. Thanks! Margalit and Margalit! Where the blanket? I brought, but did not see you. You were not here, so I... I am here all the time. Yard, Yard! Good! Share them. Here. Let's. Water, water. Look, they're... they're very tired. They find it difficult to go... It is impossible to stop. The British patrol. Soon will come, then will be able to relax, get a drink. Margalit... I'm... sorry about what happened. I realized what had happened with blankets. It's all right, nothing happened. Want some tea? No thanks. Do you have any glue? Why do you have glue? Heart broke. Go through! What happened? Two women killed, a hand grenade. From Kibbutz Gvat. What happened? Two girls killed. They threw a grenade. Kibutsnitsy of Gvata. Go through! Go. We have come from other places. But you have to get acquainted with the work... Good. It's time to get acquainted with their culture. There's no one to talk! -He's right! At Bedouin revenge, it is a duty, custom, culture, tradition. So what do you say we do? -Speak Arabic with them, in a language that they understand. in the European and in the Argentine. -Well, in a language that they understand. Do you hear what he proposes? -Oh, really... On arabskom- at all... -But you can not behave as they do. You want to live here? Well? -Behave yourself, as it is here. What do you mean, "how is made?" How are they? -Of course of course. I did not give anything, you gave, he did not give, you do not give. "Tutetat Stam, Stam ti?tat." Just below, just down. Look, it's an idea, not just words, it is also a movement. Let's start with something simple, to knock the wheels of the train. With the steps... Margalit, I'm sorry, I must go. We are coming from the area south of the village. From there we will continue to move to the east. In this district, house where girls are killers. It is next to the tomb of Sheikh. People... Meet this of the new Paul. He wants to join us. Hello. -Hello. Do you speak Hebrew? A? -Not really. He knows how to use a gun? He says yes. -Yes. No, no, Uri, I can not take it with us. Tell him that it would be more opportunity. Thanks. What kind of house? House of village families. But it's important to know - they are waiting for a reaction on our part. This means that they will put a serious protection. Therefore, without undue initiatives! Dudik has follow the instructions, just listen to what I say! But if we know that they are ready, why react now? There is logic in what you say, but we got an indication respond immediately. And this, too, there is a logic. Well, it's late, so you should break up. What happened? -Uzi hurt. You do not come back there. -I will not leave him. You can not go back there! Uzi! We must continue, nothing can be done. There has been a disaster. It is impossible to continue as if nothing had happened. We need to take a break. Guys continue. Come on, get up. We will guide all of the text first, and movement with the first phrase, exactly according to the size and rhythm. Each neighbor is watching to make sure he was doing the same. Good? And make sure that the movement was synchronized. First. You think you can fix it? I figured, I'll take and fix it. It is necessary to check all. -Trust me, I'll check. Hello, Mr. Joseph. How are you? Well, Adele. What did I tell you? It is not good that you come to us now, you know? The situation is somewhat uncertain. Yes. Therefore, come in 2-3 weeks, when passions abate, you understand? In the meantime, come to Zippori, Take a little bit of honey for his wife. Good? -Thanks. After 2-3 weeks? -Somewhere so... Well, thank you, thank you. Bye! -Bye! Stop! You were the Jews? I 'm a sick person, I go for treatment. -How to treat? Not! I was told that you go for the honey. Where's the honey? Show me the honey! -It's a good honey, a good honey. -Give, give honey Let me look at your honey. This is - honey? Home! Go home. Your house is not there. Come on, go! Get out of here! Go! Home! Margalit? What is it? What's happening? Best friends of my parents came from Poland. They - the survivors of the camps. And their son is here. He's our age. Roger. Would you like to enter? Mom made the tea and cake. No, I wanted to tell you something. I'll tell you tonight. No, no, tell me right now. It's a letter from Tel Aviv. -Well? By Nachum. Great! AND? We will see. In the end, you sacrifice yourself for the theater, you know? ABOUT! Nahalal arrived! Pnina, meet: Margalit, In my opinion, in Nahalal grown actress, very talented. Thanks! -Beautiful, very beautiful. Wait here. I'll be back and will explain to you where the exams? Do not, I'll find myself. Good luck! -See you after? Many thanks! Beautiful. -Yes. But the beauty - that's not all, eh? Children. I look at you and see myself. They like me. them clothes torn, dirty, and they are approaching... Well thank you. We will notify you. Hello. -Hello. What is your name? Margalit. Margalit... And, of Nahalal? -Right. What have you got us, Margalit? I made it Berl Katznelson at a rally to protest against the British. You are welcome. "Let him know our enemy: We will not be intimidated! Not your grace given to us by our land, and no cheating, you subtract it from us! " And... -"Do not be able to!" Maybe you have prepared something else? Something dramatic, the comic? Emotional? A... I have a verse Uri Nissan Gnessin, which I saw Rovina recited for young people. Rovinj? Are you from Nahalal? Right. I asked my parents for my birthday in 16 years, to allow me to go to see her, in Haifa. You are welcome. "When he came back after wandering and come to their land, I'll be quiet. And when he comes in the mother's house, I will see his face, again I see his face, I'll be quiet. And when he looks at me, when he looks at me in the recesses of the soul when a glance, in his deep compassion, in the majesty of his masculine sorrow, as the hero, putting on armor, I wear a gloomy calm. And he will stretch out his hand to me in farewell, I take his hand in farewell, I take rest breathing his big hands, his warm hands, embracing, repulsive, reliable. And erased memory about that stupid trembling of my hands. I'll be quiet." Thank you, Margalit. Very well! We will notify you. -Thanks. Margalit. You saw? Yes, it was very good! How do you feel? Well, I think... Look, I want to invite you tonight to the club. And, I'm sorry, I can not stay. Are you sure? There performance Yafy Gostin Yarkoni... Yafy? -Yes. My favorite singer. Tomorrow morning, I'm working on the farm and I can not stay, Nahum. I really appreciate everything you've done. -But you just arrived. What will happen if you stay in Tel Aviv for just one night? A? I promise that the next time I come to do, I'll go with you. Pity. Bye! "Yesterday - the mouth is closed, tomorrow - mouth open. Rolling wheels, driven by the wind, non-stop, non-stop. Stop - it's just training, only preparation." Margalit! You have time? -For what? I've got news, and there is still the idea. The news on the radio? Or... No, the news that news. I heard that the affair with Courtyard ended. Indeed? -Uh-huh. Thank you, God! Now listen to the idea. We drive to Beit Keshet, on a date. In Beit Keshet? But... but it's not terribly nice, it will be very noticeable. Why it will be noticeable? We're going to visit Alona,??my cousin. That he did not think that I achieve it. Why would he think that? Because this is true! As well here! I did not imagine that it is such a "hole." That the "hole"? This - the first Kibbutz Palmach! So did not dare to say "hole"! They'll kill you! Come on, get up. Many thanks! -Thanks! Tomorrow have to get up early. You recorded at the garden. What? Tomorrow is already working? We just came here. Give us a minute to rest. You can not just guests. You eat here, is not it? Okay, where we sleep? What a score. A few people left in the workshop, and there are free beds. Alon, are you going? When you're done there, I'll take you to the barracks. Good evening, Shoshi. Good evening. These girls will spend the night here. Good. Where are you from? From Nahalal. Where... Can I sleep here? Here? No, this bed Eli. These 2 beds are occupied. You can sleep here. Good night. I'm going to protect. Goodnight! Margalit... There is nothing to wait for. I have to get up early tomorrow. I'm tired, I go to bed. Good night. -Good night. He did not even look at me. What do you want? He works. Now look, I count to 10, and, you see, he looks at me. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... 9 and a quarter, 9 and a half, 9 and three quarters... -Enough! Annoying! It's not funny! Tired! I'm leaving! Margalit! It is, after all, only gave him water. I do not come here and would not have hoped for a minute, a second, that he will pay attention to me... Do not jump to conclusions. -I do not exist for him. This is not true. Margalit Margalit... I will not stay a minute. I'm going home. What? Margalit! Margalit! You go to the protection 3. Yes, but I agreed with Yoav, he will replace me... Last time I try, I swear to God, Get lost, get lost... I agreed with Yoav that will replace it. -No, no, no. You can not do the replacement, it's just... -Eli... Well, we'll talk about it. So how is work? I'm not afraid of hard work. And what do you say about Beit Keshet? The truth is that this place is the best in the world? After Nahalal. If I ask you to take me there now? In Nahalal? -I've got to go. Right now I have a deal there. I'll go find a free bike. Thanks. What? He agreed? They went back to our territory. Hello, Abed. How are you? -Praise be to God. But why in our land? We have agreed with your father, that herd shall pass through our land. Sheep go, I'm going after them. Abed, sheep coming for you, where you are, there they are. On this earth there is nothing. She had not sown. Nothing today but after a month we Plow and seeded. And you will pass with rams and say that I let you... Say, with Allah's help... sow sow... No, dear, pretty, our land. Last time! Say hello to father. Bye! -Bye! How do you know Arabic? They're our neighbors. If you don't know their language, how we live? Here? -Yes. Caution. Thanks! -Everything is good. No need to thank. This is the case for me to visit his parents Uzi. Very fond of him. He was supposed to take part in the presentation that I make right now. Uzi? Yes, he was very talented. I am preparing a presentation for the holiday moshav, and he had a major role. His brother is now involved in his stead. I would be very happy if you come. If it depends on me, I promise to come. Okay, I have to go before it is too late. Bye! We are already worried. Are you okay? Cook you something? No, no, it's okay. What do I owe? Thanks to Yehuda and his ensemble. And now - Shlyonsky. "A train". Directed by Margalit Dre. "Iron Train - I! Get away! Who is the father and mother? Tell me! Get away! Phew, I'm tired! Train puffs, grinds teeth, smokes. Down with the silence! Down with the silence! Voice trailed off, I'm dead, dead, we are dead, you are dead, they died... Dead!" It really was good. You're very talented. Thanks. But, the truth is that I... Actually, I want to be an actress. Actress? But I know that it is - not a job. And, apparently, in the end, I'm going to learn from the workshop educators. I read somewhere that there is a shortage of teachers and educators. Goodnight! You know, on the bus I liked you? Indeed? So why are not you doing anything? There was no time. The new kibbutz, Palma... Simply, there was no time. I want you to come to me in a kibbutz on Saturday. And if not? You are obliged, it's my birthday. Michalik! All... Roger leaves. Where to? Volunteer. He wants to defend the homeland. How to use it? I love him. That you serious? I really hope. Take care of yourself, do not be a hero. Well? I was accepted into the Actors Studio. This is an invitation to an introductory meeting with the teachers in Tel Aviv. You're not happy? I do not know... How was the trip? He dropped us off there... at the end... -It usually is - Yosele. I thought you zaberosh us... -Yes... You can sleep here. Sit down for a minute, I brought you something. What is it? Pie. Take with a guard. Thanks! This is me speckle. Shh... Hush, there is not a family bedroom. I'm sorry, Shoshi, you're right. -What are you making fun? Frustrating when act as lead. Goodnight! Good night! -Good night! As beautiful here! I'd arranged there any idea of?? Tanach. Performance? -Yes. Anything with biblical characters, talking, reciting... Here, in the middle of the field? -Why not? I do not know... I can not imagine it. As we have seen, you have a good imagination... Dudik, you drink coffee? -Of course! Okay, guys, listen to "stories" that have not yet heard, We have not heard yet. Well, again it starts these stories. We heard Boaz... It is - it is what he told me last week. cardboard. -Potato! Potatoes... potatoes! Potato, potato, Paul. Friends, I want a moment of attention. I am pleased to congratulate Eli, from my point of view, the representative of an ancient race, descended from the pages of the Tanakh... Enough, enough, Uri, do not exaggerate. Okay, not the Tanakh and the Talmud. Speech from the throne! No, no, no, no. I'm not an expert on the speeches. -So what? I'm not used to speak. Last time orated at a bar mitzvah. Well well! Okay, I can only say that he was glad to be a part of you. AND... And I'm happy... I'm happy. Let's drink! Congratulations! -Many thanks. -Congratulations! For Eli! -For you! Thanks! Your potatoes with me, Sefi. Bon Appetit! Thanks. Eli, I... I just want you to know that we had at the beginning of... Only tselovashki and hugs... After 2-3 months, if officially, it... Good. Give leg. What was it? There is a mouse? And snakes. What kind of moshavnitsa? I did not teach you that in the hayloft there is all sorts of creepy? Enough! I can not do this anymore! Enough! You have to press, so we were given a room! I have no one else will not push. When it is, then it will be. But this is ridiculous. You can not live in a room for ten. There are things much more important. One two Three... Good morning! Girls! When you're done here, you can see the plates and glasses? You will not leave here until you are finished wash them! But tomorrow I'll be in a bakery or in the garden. Right? You promised. That's right, I promise. We have a duty, at least a week, and you are only 2 days. You should be here a few more days at least. Irritating. You should have seen what happened here... before Hankin bought the land. There was nothing. He bought a wasteland. Parched earth, stones, rocks. It is hard to imagine how much work we have invested here. And now, look, the land is suitable for almost all crops. This - my favorite smell. "The land is my land gracious unto death..." On the contrary, we have decided to build a permanent settlement of the kibbutz. So... When married, we will have their own homes. Only ours. When we married? Do not you agree? Indeed? You impressed? I love you! How's it going, guys? Friends, attention! We've got good news: not 2, but 3 couples decided to get married. Congratulations! -Congratulations! We are discussing today the receipt of a request of the family room. What? -What does it mean? -Like this? What does it mean? I am here for 2 years and have not yet received a family room. When it becomes available... When will it be possible? The second question: what should be the fate of the gifts? As you know, many parents bring good gifts: or radio or electric kettles, maybe gramophones. Question: What should be the fate of these gifts? Whether they are public property, that is, our common, or is it a private property. No private property will destroy everything. Private property will destroy everything. It is wrong, it can not be so. This will destroy any friendship on a kibbutz. Radio - is a luxury? I have a suggestion. Everyone who receives gifts from their parents, It uses them 2 weeks and then passes them on to other members, each enjoyed 2 weeks. Good idea, Rogelio. Let's put it to a vote. Who is in favor, to gifts passed around the circle, raise your hand. Calmed down? I do not like it. Even the tea to share? Margalit, I... was not born in a kibbutz, I was not raised in a kibbutz. It is important that you know that live here is not the only option, as you think. You're right, it is unnatural to share all that you possess. And also unnatural to think of others before you think about yourself. And, of course, it is not natural to be on guard every night and work during the day. But now this is the position. This is the time in which we live. I do not want him to put my things. Now it annoys me. We can assume this issue has been resolved? You do not care how I feel? You know what they say about me here in the kibbutz? What am I - individualist, I, of course, get you out of the Kibbutz... Who told you that? I've heard. You can be calm. I will make this kibbutz is only on a stretcher... And if I can persuade you? -Do not try. Welcome, please, please. Hello! -Hello! How are you, Margalit? -Good good. Good to see you. -How is the father, mother? Everything is OK, thank you. Thanks. -Oh, who has come to us! Hi! -Hello hello. Sheikh Abu Nimer. -How are you? How do you? Please please. May Allah bless you. Welcome... Nayef, pour them coffee, pour! -Thanks. You are welcome. -Sheikh Abu Nimer, Meet this - Margalit, a friend of mine. We're going to get married. You what? We are going to get married. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Thanks. -"From you - money, and from it - the children..." Congratulate them! Thanks. -Congratulations. -I am blessed. What do you hear? How are the mother and father? Thank God, it works, and my mother too. I see them a little, they are engaged in Jerusalem. To tell you hello. On the birthday of his father called him Eli, as well as my name is Ali... It is Adele, who comes for the stings of bees. Hey. My son, Ibrahim, He says that you love the horse. A horse likes you. -Thanks. May Allah bless you. How are you doing? Like you, waiting for rain. Seeded the earth, and it will rain. rain from Allah, glorified His name! -Right. Blessed Allah will send rain for the benefit of all. You and him, and him, all, all good people. Right. But Sheikh Abu Nimer. -Yes? You promised to respect the boundaries of our land. But, despite our requests, your flock goes there. You heard? Yes, there are. Drink coffee, remove the alarm from the heart. Everything will be good. Help yourself, please. Eat something. -Thanks. Many thanks. This grape leaves filled with, and it is Fig... Figure? -Yes. Nazim? -Yeah, try it. Can you do it? How? -So. So, keep these 2 fingers. Exactly. So! Grandfather taught me. So the priests blessed the people. Now only two of us in the world. No, I do not know what she wants? It will be in the open field, without a scene. I'll play Nomi and find someone who will play Ruth. -She's new here? No, it is impossible that everyone jumped up with the idea and was driving us crazy. Dalia, I do not understand why this way? -Because it does not fit. No, no, here - the kibbutz. Here, people are falling from fatigue. Can not be so... This one will not be affected. -Look, if it comes in a year or two with this idea, we accept it with open arms. Now it does not fit! Why do we live? Only to eat, drink and sleep? You need something else, and for the soul! I do not ask anything, Only to prepare the resolution. I will return to the people, will ask for an hour here, an hour there for rehearsal... No, no, no... -This will not affect anyone... You burdened people. It's a pity. Who I burdened? You know? Raise the issue at the meeting. But I now say to you: there is no chance that they will take. Margalit, do not take it to heart. They do not want to right now. You will see that in a month or two they will agree. It all depends on perseverance. I can not make a commitment to live. I want the freedom to engage in what I believe. I work hard, like everyone else, and I want to do... that give meaning, content of this life. -Good. I want to live here with you, but not with all the others. Do you hear what you're saying? Will not work... Why not? Because I am one of those people who live here. Perhaps you need some more time to think about it. Time to think? Margalit, here is something deep and fundamental that you are not ready to accept. I'm not going to leave the kibbutz. Therefore, either you take me to this kibbutz, or... Or what? I suggest you take a break. For you... Think well alone... if you can live here. Good... I understand. It was clear... - rely on them... It was obvious. -"Belgium - for. Bolivia - about. Brazil - for. Belarus - for. Egypt - against. El Salvador - abstained. Ethiopia - abstained. France - about. Greece - against. Guatemala - for. Haiti - for." Margalit? Come on, let's go, go listen to the radio with us. Let's go to. "Yemen - against. Yugoslavia - abstained. Resolution proposed by the Committee on Palestine, adopted by a majority of 33 votes..." We have a state! This is a miracle! This is a miracle! My friends, a miracle! We have a Jewish state! -Zipporah! Wines! Pies! Come on, help yourself and friends! But we paid dearly for it, you'll see. I'm glad to see new faces here. Edna, you can read our statement of Berl Katznelson? You are welcome. "Art can see ahead, cure disease, open up new opportunities, expressing the aspirations of man. But it can not be a vehicle for social change." Good. Thanks. But, let me I don't agree with the words of the great Berl. All of you, all of you are not only talented, you are also the carriers of social consciousness. You have been chosen to make the human soul to become even better. Because otherwise... Who needs theater? Something to drink? Yes, I want to drink. I'm glad you're here. And I. Do you like Tel Aviv? Highly. You have, in small villages, time passes slowly. Here differently here all the time something happens, new people meet, suddenly open unfamiliar places. It... This - the life... This place... Thanks! -You are welcome. What is it? -Do not worry, it's a good drink. And I brought you a present. Chekhov. "Gull". The dream of every actress. I do not know what to say... You know, I have here a lot of connections. ... And I'll try to help you. You know, sometimes it is not as important as talent, which do not hold... Here, in Tel Aviv, you'll get a perfect time Margalit, you take off, I'm sure. Yes... but no... not now... I think. It is a pity, all impressed of your talent. It is very difficult to be accepted. You miss your opportunity... It will not happen again. Here - my apartment. Do you want to climb up to me? Drink cold water and continue to walk. What do you say? I... I have decided that I will not stay. And, all right, you can refuse. Let's just continue to walk. Everything is good. I am very grateful to you. I know what you're trying to help me, but I decided that no, that I'm not... Dad? Margalit! What happened? I'm back. What with the studio, with studies? With our Rovinj? I tried, but it's not... It is wrong today. You know... Eli was here. I am asking for you. Eli? -Yes. When? -Yesterday. We are told that you are in Tel Aviv. Dad, we'll talk later. Good? I have to go. You go to my mother? -I've already talked to her. Eli... We met a guys and see what happened to them. We live nearby - Jews and Arabs, but what happens - a mess! What a mess? -We do not want that. Hello. -Hello, and be blessed! We, with the help of Allah, will settle the matter, and everything will be fine. But things are not in order. -Why? You let the Jews go with us, and they enjoy it, to go out and attack us and from our point of view, it is a mess. We have not heard about this. We are neighbors for a long time. Our kids play with their children. Good neighborhood ended long ago. We did not become neighbors. They - the enemies! If you want to, whether their neighbor, but they will not walk on our land. You're talking about the Jews, right? Jews... walk not in our lands. So not taken from us, you have to decide you're with us or you're with them. You - our brothers or them. Have you heard about this? I have not heard about this. Jews do not do such things. We are neighbours. There can't be a good neighbor to the Jews. We do not want this neighborhood. For Allah's sake, stop already. That the Sheikh would sell their people and their religion? Is it possible? Where your children learn? What does it matter where they learn? Religion - is the religion, conscience - is the conscience, land - it is the land, and honor - is the honor. Do not worry, everything will. Let us pray... "Joseph and Zipporah Dromi, Nahalal, Rachel and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, and their children, Margalit and Eli, invite all the relatives, comrades and friends for a wedding, which will take place in Nahalal. Please take this as an invitation to a personal one. Many thanks to all to accept the invitation." Very well. I'm afraid... I am very afraid... I'm not sure that the Arabs will take what we do here. It may be time, perhaps... even surround Jerusalem. AND? If surround Jerusalem, we can not come to the wedding. A wedding is a once in a lifetime. So what do you suggest, to postpone the wedding? No, no, do not put off the wedding. Not. This - the deluge! Only not ceased. For you will still be rain on our wedding. It is still a question. I arranged to have it finished for 2 days before the wedding. But tomorrow will be a rainbow in the clouds. What could be more beautiful? Well, as a room? A little tight, but I like it. The bed is a treasure. You need to make it in the literature about the Torah. This will increase the "interior repatriation." Thank you, Yoav! Well, enjoy! I brought wine. Where to put it? -Thank you, David, put it in the pantry. Tzipora? He goes to the Jews. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! I told you, stop! Stay! Joseph, where to put the pot? So that? Tzipora prepares his wonderful soup? Yes, and there are also excellent cakes. Do not come late. I'm waiting for you. I will try. Josko, be careful. People! Herd again moving through the fields of the kibbutz. Who is it, Abed? -I do not know. You need to put a stop to it. Okay, I'm going. Assemble all. I not sure have time to come tonight. But I'm sure tomorrow will come. Have a good trip! Arie! Come on, we should go! Here they are there. I understood. Come on, let's go! Stop! -Good! Mother, do not cry! Our sons do not want us to cry! "Beauty is yours, Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How have the heroes! Tell it not in Gath, do not cry on the streets of Ashkelon, not to happy daughters of the Philistines, not to triumph daughters of the uncircumcised. Mountains of Gilboa! Do not come down no dew nor rain on you, and it shall not be on you with the fruits of the fields, for there the shield of the heroes! ?it Saula, no bombers eleem. Blood of the slain, from the fat heroes the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty-handed." (Tanakh, Shemueyl II of, 1, 19-22) "In the morning I get up, to embrace the void, and your head on the pillow will not, your head, beloved, dear, dear, a ray of sunshine - a fierce bayonet vonzonny to the hilt in the pillow, and a butterfly fluttering by the window will beat its wings, silently complaining: there is no longer a friend." Pnina Dromi and Eli Ben Zvi The film is dedicated to the memory of Ali, the son of Rachel Yanait and Eli Ben-Zvi, the second president of Israel, and the memory of his friends: Joseph Caspi, Abraham Ben Shabat, Levi Figneboyma, Buchbinder Noah, Isaac Poznan and Yeshigu Piknakzona who died with him in the field 03.16.1948, Kibbutz Beit Keshet.
