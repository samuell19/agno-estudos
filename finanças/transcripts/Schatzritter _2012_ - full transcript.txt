Jeff! Jeff, it's late. Come. Come to bed. Will you tell me another story? Yes, tonight a very special story. Here, from this book. This belonged to my dad before me. And before that, his dad. It is the story of Sigefrid and the mermaid Melusina. In the year 963,... ...the noble knight Sigefrid was riding along the Alzette, below Bockfelsen... ...when he caught sight of a beautiful woman. Dazzled by her beauty, he asked her to marry him. Melusina promised him fidelity if he vowed to leave her alone one day a week. On this day, Sigefrid was not allowed to disturb Melusina under any circumstances. Sigefrid agreed. He founded the city of Luxembourg... ...and they lived happily with their children in the castle from then on. Years passed, during which Sigefrid kept to the agreement. But distrust crept into his heart. And his brother, who was jealous of the love between them,... ...urged Sigefrid to find out what she was concealing from him. And so he discovered that she had a fish tail. Melusina screamed and disappeared. But what the legend does not tell is that Melusina possessed a treasure. And the treasure vanished with her. And since then,... ...she has been condemned to return every seven years for exactly seven days. And only in these seven days can she be redeemed. And if a brave knight manages to find this treasure,... ...then Melusina will also be redeemed. If not... If not, then... ...then she is lost forever. Jeff, this amulet, it belongs to the Treasure Knights. You have to take good care of it. Do you hear? I love you so much. Listen, Jeff. We play hide and seek. When I say "hex hex", you... you hide. Good. Hex hex. You stay in here, okay? Open the door! What are you doing here? I want to get what they have stolen from me. You will use it incorrectly. Give me the key immediately! No! Now I can solve the riddle. They are not riddles. They are tests and you will fail them! Every day for seven years I have been looking forward to this moment. Heart failure is very rare in young women. You could not have helped her at all,... ...even if you had returned earlier from your business trip. My son says... ...a man was there, in a black coat, and a bolt of lightning came out of his arm. Your son imagined it. This is a protective mechanism. He is in shock. That's why I think you should be there for him as much as possible right now. That's all you can do. Thank you. The man will not come anymore? Jeff, there was no man. Hey, hold on, Jeff! Until later. - But you're waiting... - Until you pick me up, yes. Have fun with your friends. Today we talk about trust. How many of you know Melusina's story? Put your helmet on, little Jeff. But what did he do, Lisa? He peeked through the keyhole anyway. That's right, he didn't trust her and was punished for it. And do you know in what way? Melusina disappeared. Very good, Lisa. And the treasure with her. What treasure? The treasure of Melusina. Don't tell stories, Jeff. - My mother told me about it, though. - No, Jeff. That's not in the legend. The mommy who let bad man kill her. Oh, is the dopey necklace from mommy too? What's going on there, Jeff? We talked about the legend of Melusina. That's when Jeff said something about some treasure. I have the impression that he lives far too much in his stories. Maybe it's from playing so many computer games. Thank you, Mr. Heidkopf. I'll try to keep a better eye on him. It'll be fine. You've been through a lot. Come. As of today, you are banned from the computer. I'm going out. The things from the garage still have to go to the kiosk. It's my first day of holiday today. All right, go play. But stay in sight, only as far as the creek, promise? Here, take these out as well. Out of the way! So you want to steal my gold? You disgust me, jellyfish! Pirate, where were you? Did you drink up all our glory? Killer? Captain Killer commands, we must surround him. Food! Oh no, the sirens, they're calling me! Cover your ears! It's not working. Fight on, strong pirate. I am doomed! This feels nice. I am Melanie. I'm Jeff. It's wonderful here. Especially at the castle. Yes, that's ours. Now that's a coincidence. Do you have any idea who owns the campsite? That belongs to us too. What are you doing here? I do excavations, I'm an archaeologist. Do you know the legend of Melusina? That's a beautiful legend. Good day. Sorry about the fence, I sometimes have problems with the pedals. Uh, is this yours? Good day. Melanie, is there any way I can pay for the damage? Oh no problem, I can fix that myself. You want to bring it to us? How long can you stay? One week. I have caught one that was 35 cm before, Dad. - You did? - Yes. I don't believe that. Oh Dad, I'm going to take out the trash. - See you soon. - Yeah. The same birthmark. The youth! What is it? My Lord, the golden stones, they are back. They are back again. Then the time has come. Black Brothers, the search can begin anew. Yes, my lord. An archaeologist has arrived at the campsite. Perhaps she can help you. But what if she is a Treasure Knight? A what? Treasure Knight. There is no Treasure Knight. I destroyed them all. Whereby, I have lost my arm. For the next seven days, the treasure can be recovered. You and I will find it. Arius. Come, my friend. Yes! - Leo! - Hey, Jeff. I was beginning to think you wouldn't come at all this summer. Sure you did, sure you did. Julia preferred to go to Mallorca, but bad luck for her. Where is she then? She's still getting ready. For what? - Hello Michael. - Hello. It's good to see you. - Hello. - Hello. - What's wrong with her? What has she got? - Well, she's just in puberty. It's really exhausting having to be a brother right now. You're exactly two minutes older than me, wise guy. At that age, girls are really stupid. That is a law of nature. You are immature. That is a law of nature. - Are we going up? - I really need to tell you something. You don't want to come? You're here at last. I thought you really weren't coming anymore. I'm so happy to be here. At home it's just full of stress, I'm stuck. How did you manage that? Julia is now the smart one and I'm the dork. Dad even gave a cell phone as a reward. With Internet. And now she chats with her boyfriend all the time. With her boyfriend? Yes, he is two years older. Whoa, your collection has grown really big. Leo, two days ago a woman arrived at the campsite. Nah, a real woman? Leo, listen to me. Her name is Melanie and she's an archaeologist. And you know what else she said? - She wants to stay exactly one week. - So what? - We want to stay for a week as well. - Leo, you know the legend. - One week is seven days. - Yes. You've texted me about it often enough. Every seven years you can find Melosina's treasure. But only when she's there herself. And for how long? You're not telling me that... Yes, it is! She came out of the water with her camper. Huh? Tell me something else: Have you seen it yourself? The car crashed through the fence right by the creek. That's just a woman, but can not drive. Leo, she is beautiful. - Her hair is long and curly. - Yes? Do you have a photo? Nah, but I saw her through the window. - Naked? - No, but... Oh, the mature sister is coming to visit. I just need to make a phone call and the reception sucks downstairs. Hi. I made a couple of quick calls. You're not answering. - What did you see? - On her belly? - There was just something strange. - What are you whispering so sweetly? No, that's just my brother and his friend. They're off on another treasure hunt. Exactly. She's a pain in the ass. Shall we go to the castle? Who will be first to the wind chimes? Watch out! Hey! Come! What's wrong with your face? The idiot from my class. He's always annoying. Because of this. It's really cool. Really old, isn't it? It's an heirloom from my family. Come, I'll show you a new move I learned. There! Come on, try it. Okay, speed it up, come on! Ah! Huh? Leo! Leo! Jeff, this is awesome! Come down, quickly! Come! Cool! It's just like Indiana Jones. A vase? Who would want to put flowers here? What's the room here for, anyway? What's she doing here? Did you put this there? I know the key from somewhere. Yes, definitely from one of your 100 Melusina books. Where else? I think my mother had one of those too. Shit, it's already late. This is my father. Here you go. - Thanks. - Just keep walking, Leo. - Maybe he won't notice us. - Jeff, come over here. Don't tell me now that we have the woman.... You were at the castle again, weren't you? How many times have I told you not to go there alone? What a sight you are again! Come along! Stay away from the castle, once and for all! This has been my fault. I taught him how to fight so he could defend himself better at school. As of today, the castle is off limits. It will be sold soon anyway. What? You can't do that! This is Mom, her castle! I know, but renovating it is too expensive. She always said we must never sell it, because it belongs to Sigefrid. Jeff, we can't afford this anymore. If we don't fix up the campsite, no more guests will come. I will come back. Good. I can try to find another solution. Promise? I think it's time you went home for dinner. And don't you dare go to the castle again tomorrow. Oh man, it's getting worse and worse. How can you stand it? Yeah, it wasn't always like this. I mean, if we can't go tomorrow, we can go today. - To the castle? - Yeah. Rather not. Jeff, do you want the treasure or don't you? So if this really is Sigefrid's castle,... ...then maybe you are a great-great-great-great-grandson of his. Okay, but only after midnight, when my father is asleep. What was that? Whoa, that must have been someone's cat. Here they are. Hopefully they'll still work. Yes. Where are you going, noble knights? Whoa, who is that? What are you doing here? Squire Killer, always at your service. For your crusade to the castle. Can't he say anything normal? Killer, go home! But my father is a knight. Without me, you don't stand a chance! His father is a knight? Last year, he was an astronaut. He probably doesn't even have a father. Anyway, he never came along before. Okay, come with me then, but shush. As soon as the sun rises, you will knight me. My father always says that you only become a knight... ...when you face dangers and show courage. He even slayed a dragon in Ireland. That is, a real one. There are no dragons. And there are no more knights either. But the Treasure Knights? Yes, but no one has ever seen them. Who are the Treasure Knights? Since Melusina disappeared, the Treasure Knights... ...have been trying to find her treasure every 7 years and redeem Melusina. You forgot about the Black Sisters. No one knows them either. Who are the Black Sisters? They are called Black Brothers and are the descendants of Sigefrid's brother. They are also looking for the treasure, but they are evil. They hate Melusina. Shit, who's that? - No idea. - Black Brothers. Wouldn't you like to be brave knights? Squire Killer is armed. Easy, I got this. Did I scare you? Nonsense, what are you doing here? And what are you doing here, Treasure Knights? What do you care? So, now you can go back to playing with your friend. We discovered a picture back there. Perhaps a clue to the treasure. Don't you want to help us? The treasure, then let's see. Looks like she's gazing somewhere. There, to the left! But there is nothing. So, now you can go home. Yes, here. Here is an old necklace. Watch out, guys! Something should happen now. Maybe it only works if we change the angle of the light. There's a limescale border in the vase. That means there used to be water in it. Yeah sure, for the flowers. It's pretty normal, isn't it? Leo! A lens! If you put water in there, the light is focused. And where are you going to get water from? What else do you actually have with you? Whoa, the Philosopher's Stone! Watch out, who knows what that is. Oh no! So what do we do now? I told you to be careful! You with your stupid treasure hunt, now we're stuck here! The key from the picture! I'll open it up for you guys. Leo, do something! If you don't mind, I don't want to spend the night here! Such shit! There must have been a key in there. Someone probably got here before us. Fucking door! So how do we get out of here? Don't worry, we'll get out of here somehow. Doesn't move a bit! Let me have a look. Give it here! You're driving me crazy, I want to get out of here! Give him a chance. There are numbers on it, but kind of twisted. Numbers, but... We need ink! Ink! Killer, you are a genius! Whoa! 16, 20, 5... That must mean something. Give it to me again. Can you think of anything now to finally get us out of here? Trust me, my beautiful maiden. Kneel, Squire Killer. Rise, Knight Killer. - Dubbed the Courageous One. - Well done, Killer. Is his father really a knight? Hello? No, I haven't slept at all. What? I don't understand you. It's really loud at your place. Okay. Yes. Yes, we can talk. My father, quickly! Mr. Kutter, good morning. Good morning Melanie, what are you doing out here so early? I've been looking around the castle a bit. We're having a barbecue tonight, over there. Maybe you can join us. Any fish? I don't like fish. There are other things too. All right, I'll come by later. Okay. When I get the treasure, I also get the beautiful woman. Coordinates... ...then you know how many steps you have to take to get there. Coordinates! Coordinates. That's it! We need Internet. Come on, to Julia! Go away! Leave me alone! What's going on? Puberty. Come on Julia, you have to help us. Ben has... He... he broke up. Your boyfriend? Why is that? I'm sure he has a crush on someone else. He says I'm too immature for him. But... then you fit perfectly with us. Your boyfriend is stupid if he just dumps you like that. Ben is not stupid! Maybe a little bit. Say something about the cell phone. No. What is it? 1-7-3-2-0-1-8. Like this, and send. Where is that located? In Luxembourg? No, in the Czech Republic. We won't make it before dinner. Try the other line. Have you tried it with letters? Uh, boys. A is one, B is two. Come on! ...W,... X,... Y,... Z. Read out the code. - 16. - P. - 20. - T. - 5. - E. - 17. - Q. - 3. - C. - 20. - T. - 19. - S. - 9. - 9 is... - I. - An I. - And 18, R. - After that read it out. It's probably not that simple. What do we do now? Jeff, when did Melusina live? Not at all. Melusina is a legend, Julia. In 963. Whoa? We tried it with just our alphabet. But in the Middle Ages, only Latin was used in writing. - We have to try Latin. - Julia is right! - And I thought we were on holiday. - Why? They are exactly the same letters. Yes, but in Latin there were fewer. There was no W, no Y, and no J. So there were exactly 23 letters. Ha! My sister. Brilliant. By the way, we have the same genes. We just have to spell it out again. "Quercus Tristis". Sounds better than protectus-nonsense. Or some shit like that. "Tristis" means "sad". And "Quercus", that means "oak". The Sad Oak. I think I know what that means! "In the Müllertal, not far from the Stone Monkey, there is an old oak tree." "It is said that many hundreds of years ago a woman sat here... ...and lured the knights with her singing." "Until one day a knight, in his haste to get to her,... ...disappeared in the nearby water." "It is said that everyone who passes by it,... ...even today, suddenly becomes very, very sad." Sad Oak. Ready for new adventures? Thank you for this morning. The oak at the Stone Monkey, it has grown old. Unfortunately it is no longer there. But roots of oak can last a very long time. French toast, I haven't eaten that in ages! Do you want mine? I already had four. Thank you. You're welcome. I still have to ask my father. What are you doing with the tandem? Yes but I... Did I give you permission to just drive away? What if something happens? I'll take care of him. We only wanted to go to the Müllertal. I hear it's so beautiful there. There you can learn a lot about sandstone! All right, but not without a safety vest. - You'll be back by lunch, understand? - Yes. And this time without injuries. I don't think your father should boss you around like that. - Leo! - It's just the way it is. You have to fight back. Adults should also learn something from time to time. Let's go and get our bikes now. And me, my equipment. Move aside. Open up! Jeff? Where's your helmet? Who is that? - Killer! - What? In the book, it says that the Stone Monkey has water. - Killer! - Take the stuff with you,... ...you'll know what we can use. You're really something, Killer. Hopefully we will at least find the treasure there. Wait! Stone Monkey! I know less than you think. Less is more than you think. What kind of woman was Melusina? A woman who does not know whom to trust. My lord! We know where we need to go. I solved the code. Enjoy the air. While you're still up here. Yeah, shoot! Catch! No! Leo! - This is the last one from this pack. - Is everything all right? I want another one, I'm hungry. I think I know who the man was. The one at the camper? I've seen him before. I think he's a Black Brother. And he has... What then? - I think he killed my mother. - What? He was there the night she died. I was behind the door, hiding. And then he ripped something off her neck. A key she always wore around her neck. And suddenly there was a lightning bolt. And my mother collapsed. And he has that key now. I've seen it. And... There was his sound... That's exactly what I heard earlier. Are you sure you didn't just imagine it? I mean, a lightning bolt? I can go on alone. Are you crazy? We are coming with you! Why else would I have become a knight? Come, we're almost there. There! He really does look like a gorilla. The Sad Oak must be here somewhere. Killer! Everything okay? Sure! Do you hear how that sounds? Brilliant! - Awesome! - That's it, the Sad Oak! Yes! Jeff, what's next in the story? One day a knight disappeared in the water. There used to be a stream here. Killer, let me see your arm. Shaped like a stream. And there's a symbol. We have to get there, fast! You hear that? The symbol. Come, help me! - We need to get in there. - Are you crazy? I'm sure not going in there. - I thought you're finding the treasure. - It's a legend! You don't even know what's down there. You might drown in there. I'm not going to risk my life on some bullshit legend. Because of a bullshit legend? My mother died because of it! How would you know that, anyway? You don't believe me, I get it, but I'm going in there now! Also, today is the fifth day. In two days Melusina will be gone. There, they work even when they're wet. - Come on, after him! - No! At least I believe him! Quick, hide! I'll go first. This is supposed to be a riddle? They're getting easier and easier. Maybe the children are already here. Children? What children? The... The... ...the children who are looking for the treasure. I knew you were hiding something from me. If I don't check up on you constantly. We have to follow. If anyone here jumps, it's me first. - Jeff needs our help. - You won't fit through it at all! We have to do something. Anyway, you can't swim, can you? But I would like to protect our master. You can't even do that! You idiot, by the way, are to blame for the fact that we are standing here now! - But all I wanted was for us to... - Leave me! You stick to my leg like a limpet. I thought you and I would stick together like.... - All in order. - Direct hit! If my father had seen that, then.... Idiot. Hand over the key! It belonged to my mother! You are the son of that damned Treasure Knight! You killed her! Your mother doesn't protect you any more! Couldn't you solve the puzzle? Or why did you steal the key from her? Hold your tongue! She gave it to me, and now you're doing the same! Why do you of all people want to redeem Melusina? Redeem? Don't make me laugh. I want only the treasure! Arius, give him a kiss goodbye. The sword! Jeff! You can't just leave me sitting here! Jeff! Why aren't you doing anything? Your best friend needs help and you just stand still? You're always playing the hero! Jeff! Jeff, can you hear me? Jeff, are you okay? My mother was a Treasure Knight. Everything will be fine, don't get excited. We still need to put something on your wound. - Here. - Thanks. What happened? Was that the strange man? Help me, I'll prop him up. Here, take my arm. What happened? - Jeff! - He hurt himself. We... It's good. Wouldn't you rather wrap that up? Will you? Thanks. Hold on. What is she doing here all of a sudden? Where have you come from? Where have you come from? How... are you? I'm going to take you home now. Here? Jeff! Didn't we say you'd be back for lunch? We lost track of time. What happened? I told you to be careful! Did you find him or what? First of all, thank you for bringing him in. Come. What do you have there? Show me. What is this? Where did you get this from? You know what? I don't want to hear it. You'll make up some story again! You're grounded for the rest of the holiday. After all, I can't control him all the time. It's been so hard since his mother... I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. You should just have a little more confidence. May I go in? - May I? - Yes. Where did he strike you? How do you know that? There? These are herbs. You're about to fall into a deep sleep. You'll feel better in the morning. Shall we get you to bed? Jeff. The key. The last tear. You have to keep going. The tear of Sigefrid. I... I love you. You... You must never forget. Morning, Jeff. Morning. Feeling better? Yes. Sorry about yesterday. - It's all right. - I'm just worried for once. We miss your mother's support. Ultima... Avtem... Lacrima... A... Sigefrido... Venire... Tebet. Jeff? Our parents wanted to go home, but Leo just kept talking until they said we could stay. He even promised to do math problems every day. Are you crazy? Math problems? Glad you are still here. Leo says there's something on the sword. A symbol for the treasure. My father locked the sword away. Oh man! - Did someone say something about a sword? - Killer! Where did you get that from? Well, my dad used to steal art. And this morning, as I was walking along the Way of St. James, we come to a river. And my mother said... Sorry about yesterday. It's okay. A waterfall... You are afraid of water? But please don't tell anyone. And especially not Julia. I won't. What's that? My mother was also looking for the treasure. She got as far as the sheath, but did not find the sword. Tell me, where did you actually find the sword? On a skeleton! It looked like they had been fighting. Leo, look! These are symbols, but they don't make any sense. Man, I saw something! Maybe we need to do something with it. The reflection in the water! There! Whoa! Melusina... Lacrimabat... Sub... Sigefridi... Oculis. Lacrimabat... That means "cried". Cried under... Oculis... Eyes. Melusina cried under Sigefrid's eyes. And there's one more symbol! The symbol again! Wait a minute. I also saw this in the photo. There, at the cathedral! Whoa! We have to get to the cathedral, quick! Jeff, put some clothes on. The buyer of the castle is already here. What? You promised we wouldn't sell the castle! No, I said I would look for another solution. But there is none. - We're flat broke, Jeff. - No, you can't sell the castle! - I forbid you! - Now off to your room! Today you're not going anywhere! Thank you for letting me use the bathroom. I think we're in agreement, aren't we? Yes, thank you, Mr. Neveri. Here are the keys to the castle. It's sufficient if you transfer the money to me at the end of the month. I can transfer it as early as tomorrow. I'm going to get another good deal tonight. The woman from the campsite! Because my father used to be a lifeguard,... And that's how I got to the sword. Wake up, you turtle doves! Well, about the water bomb, I didn't quite get it. But cool! If I ask you now what you actually want here, will I get an honest answer? I'm going to do my shopping. Go on with you! Come! We could search here for two days without finding anything. Two days is too long. Today is the sixth day. - Tomorrow Melusina will disappear. - Jeff, Melusina is a legend. The treasure will still be here tomorrow. No, it won't. It disappears with her. Sigefrid, founder of Luxembourg. But where is Melusina? Who cries under Sigefrid's eyes? We're so stupid! Why is that? The cathedral was built in the 17th century. But the treasure has been around since the 10th century. The clue can't be here at all. Under his eyes... Maybe there's something older under the cathedral. The crypt! Come, there was a sign at the entrance What? What's going on here? It must be here! - Do we really want to go in there? - Yes, come on! Come over here! I found something! Sigefrid. This must be it. Again, the same symbol. Come on! Pretty spooky here. Eww... spiders. Melusina. And Sigefrid. What is this? A bottle. Anything in there? Full of dust. Looks like no one has been here in ages. The Last Tear. What's that supposed to mean? What did you just say? Here. - The Last Tear. - And here... ...here is a hole. What's wrong? - No, it's totally Russian. - My mother said the same thing. Just before she died. Look, Leo, look! She didn't find the sword. But an engraving for it. Maybe you have to put the sword in there. Maybe that's what it said on the sword sheath. Anyway, she made a copy. But the Last Tear must come from Sigefrid. Move over! Sigefrid's eyes. He looks at Melusina. Melusina cried under Sigefrid's eyes. As in the legend. I know the melody. We stir. Give me the bottle. Why? - What do you know about Melusina's tears? - Give it here now! Go get it yourself! If you don't want to die,... ...give me the bottle now. Give it to him. But what about the treasure? What about our lives? I hope you can swim. We have to get out of here! Everything here is collapsing! But that's quite a lot of water. Come on, Leo! It's just one big step! Come on! Come! The sword! Oh no! Killer, come back! Leave it! Killer, come! You have to jump, you can do it! Go! No! - Killer! - It's too heavy! - Killer! - Help him! Killer, let go of the sword! Let go of the sword, it's too heavy! Killer, come back! Killer! He's stuck! Do something! Jeff, the Sword. Get it. Jeff! Jeff! Thank you. What are you doing here? All is well. Slowly. Slowly. Thank you for saving me. But, how did you get in here in the first place? - I know a shortcut. - And now do you finally believe me? What? Why do you think she was here? She was there for the excavations. She's an archaeologist. We were lucky. She was at the castle and at the waterfall by the oak tree. - That was a coincidence. - No, my mother says,... ...that Melusina made up the riddles to find out who she could trust. Because only the trusted one can deliver her from the curse. I don't know. A treasure, yes okay, that can exist. But about Melusina, I just don't believe it. - I do. - Jeff, you're crazy. A mermaid. What nonsense. And? What do we do now? We have no clue where to go now. Here. Thanks. That's how late it is. The melody in the tomb. I know where I know it from! - From the castle. - The wind chime in the yard! To the castle, hurry! Quickly, to the castle! Take care. Thank you so much for the ride. Hey, look. If it hits you in the heart, you're dead instantly. It's an electric eel. But when you hold hands, the electric shock is distributed. Cool. Can this be done with a power socket? Nonsense. Are you cold? Where have you been? Where have you been? In the cathedral. In town? You just go into town without telling me? You are grounded! I've had enough! I'm never allowed to do anything! - Leo and Julia are allowed so much more! - I am your father... ...and when I say you are grounded, you are to stay home! Do you understand? You were in my... ...my secret hideout! That's mean! You've broken it! You can't do that! You live in a fairy tale world, Jeff. Stop it already! - Where are you going now? - To the castle. - Find the treasure and free Melusina. - You're not going anywhere... ...and stop talking such nonsense! Get it through your head! Yes, there is a treasure and that's why Mom is dead! - Jeff, now knock it off! - I saw it, he killed her! Believe me already! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Open the door! So what do we have to do now? The legend says that at midnight a golden serpent appears with a key in its mouth. It's almost twelve o'clock. But where is it supposed to show up? There's nothing in the legend about that. But I think there, where Melusina disappeared. There's a room down there. That used to be the washroom. Maybe it's there. The castle. Midnight. Here, I found something. The golden serpent. It's not golden at all. Looks like something needs to be put in there. A key, a bottle and a sword. Give it here! - Give it here! - No! No! There is something missing above the bottle of Melusina's tears. The Last Tear must come from Sigefrid. Idiots! Or yourself. One of his descendants. You mean this is the Last Tear of Sigefrid? Eh? What do you whisper? You know more. Right? Did your mother teach you how to lie? Bad teacher! Couldn't lie herself! You killed her! Release my son! - You killed my wife! - What if I did? My son saw it! Go! Run away! Come here! Quickly make a circle, like in the video! Idiots! Jeff! Jeff! Arius? Whoa! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven doors. Wow, now behind one of them is definitely the treasure. Which door is it? Which door is it? Go! Open the door! Go! Idiot! Go! Arius! Are you okay? Jeff, your intuition may not guide you to the right door, but I trust you. The right door. But I trust you. But why did she say that? Sigefrid did not trust Melusina. He looked through the keyhole. I'm not allowed to look. I'm not allowed to look! I did not look! I don't care about the treasure. I want you to stay. Stay here, please, please stay. Will you stay here now? Your mother would be proud of you. I thought I had lost the treasure. Whoa! Leo, look! Whoa! - Yeah! - It's glitter! Oh, look! Is this really gold? - Lots of gold! - This is big! Absolute madness, my friend! This is incredible! Are you feeling better? I have a small medicine cabinet. Maybe aspirin or buscopan will help? - Thank you. - So much gold in one place! This is cool! It's a pity that you have to leave tomorrow. Unbelievable! Oh, for real. Maybe I'll stay a little longer. Yes, we're a damn good team. What's happening with the gold now, Treasurer? We're restoring the castle and maybe we'll make a museum out of it. Take care. I miss you already. Same to you. What are you doing for the rest of the holiday? - My father is visiting me... - Ciao. Bye. Will you come and visit us in town? Yeah, sure. - Ciao. - Bye. - Then we'll definitely see you next year. - Yes, for sure. - Leo. - Leo, are you sad? Come now. Hurry up, Dad, or I'll be late. Coming. Why don't you look in the garage? Wow! Is this mine? Yes. I'm afraid I don't know how to get you to school with so much to do. Do you think you can do it alone? What? You're serious? That is out of the question. Do you mind if I accompany you? English subtitles by Alf Capone and DreamScape
