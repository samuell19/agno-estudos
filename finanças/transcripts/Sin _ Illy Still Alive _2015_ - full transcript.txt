Can I keep that? Good morning. -Good morning. You ruined yourself pretty much since the last time. Step on the scale. Your body won't take it very much longer, Miss Peterson. This is the last time. Yes, indeed. This is the last time we take you in. Two. And three in the evening. -Ok. Do you want something for the pain. I've got only one more day left. Well, then. Hey, Sin, give me that! -I had it with this crap. I bought that. It's my fucking money and I do what I want. Are you crazy? You're so petty and more stuffy than any damn banker in this goddamn city! And you're just a fucked up cheater. Go to hell. What do I care! You're really nuts. Hello. Hello! Open up! I know you are in there! Hello! Hey! Stop making so much noise. The cops will be here any minute! Sin? Hey Sin. Hi Illy. What are you doing here? I thought you were in rehab. -Oh yeah? Fuck Leon. Oh, no! But you were almost done? Forget it! Do you have a gun? This one is on me. Come along. Here you go. Hey! What's up? Gee! Sin, hey... What a horror! I thought you were gone. You took it all? Illy, open up! Illy, open up! I know you're there! -Just a moment. Get in here! What's up? Nothing, why? What is this? What did I tell you, Illy! Get out before I freak out completely! -Are you crazy or what? You don't get in here anymore! I warned you. Nobody here wants your fucking junk! Fuck you, son of a bitch. -Fucking cunt. Are you crazy or what? I'll get my stuff. -You don't get anything. Nothing at all. Get away! You don't get anything here anymore. I want my fucking money, you get it? 150 Euro! Piss off, fuck you! How stupid anyway helping this fucking cunt. Illy. Why are you dealing with that asshole? -Great! At least I had a place to sleep. Now, I got nothing at all! Illy, we were clean for 8 months. We can do it! -Really? How? Back to Psycho-club? Me definitely not! No, we just have to get away ... -Shit. somewhere where it's warm. You're dreaming, Sin. -No, I am not dreaming! We can make it. We just have to get away and do it. Sin, wake up! We don't have a single Cent in our pockets! I'll get the money! I'll get us out of here, Illy, you know? I promise! Good day. I 'd like to redeem this. Weren't you here yesterday? -No. Wait! Hey! Shit. Hey. What do you want? You. Let's forget it. We wanted something different that's what you forgot. I still want the same! -Don't you get it, Leon? I almost got caught by the cops and you are bullshitting me! I was talking to Mark. He takes all of them. Cash! Who is Mark? -Mark! Come on, give them to me. I 'll sell them to him, we get us a car and tomorrow we are at the beach, I promise. You keep telling me this for weeks now. -Yes. Look, there you can fly to Greece for 59,- Euro. Every day at 5 pm. For the fast ones. Book directly at Theon Air and we'll bring you directly to the sea. That's great and so cheap. Imagine! -So we spend afterwork at sea. You’ve got your passport with you? Well, there goes the beach. Yes, right, look. Hello. What are you doing here? -Sinja? I'm working here and you? I thought you were in rehab? -I still am, but today is my day off. I just wanted to bring something. -I see. Daddy just left for lunch. Great, it's supposed to be a surprise anyway. It's Sin, is Mark there? Open up. For three hundred they are yours. That's only 150. What? That's only 150. What a drag. Fuck you, asshole. Hey Sin! Fucking bitch! Let's get away, Ill. I'm serious. I got the tickets for both of us. If we go to the airport now, we are on the beach tonight. It's an island directly by the sea. And it is warm. We don't need anything. -Hey! Get in line! -Shut up. I don't get in any fucking line. Want a smack? Think you're better than others? Better than you, definitely. Yeah! Hey Lea! Calm down. She is with me. She'd better shut up. Hey Lea, she doesn't mean it, ok. Forget it. What's up with you? -Looks who is talking. You seem to enjoy this shit here. Just stop it. With you, Illy, with you! I got the money. The tickets cost 120 Euro. Look. We book directly at the airport. We just have to do it, damn it. With nothing? -That's the fastest. Four days, Illy, that's nothing! That's hell. Yeah, but here is hell, too. Your whole life long. You're a coward. You were just bullshitting. No, I wasn't. Ok. Ok, we go to the sea, -Cool. I'm coming with you. -Off to the beach. Where is Illy? Taking a vacation. That's what she said. How? -Yes, to the sea, with that stupid pussy. Vacation, right? Let's see how far you get. -Hey, asshole, give me my bag! Are you nuts? -Cunt. Fucker. Hey, he's got your ID card. Hey, wait. I got a passport at my mother's home. We get it and fly with that one. Where does your mother live? -Close to the airport, plus a short walk. I don't know if we can make it. Better than returning. Leon. Why don't you answer? -He just wants to rip me off. Don't you think he loves you? -Then we would already be at the sea. I see. I'm only replacing him. No! What are you talking? You said yourself that he never wanted to stop. "I have a car. Where are you?" I think he really loves you. You know, Illy, one day he'll realize that we made it. Then perhaps he will get clean, too. Where are the people here? Behind their curtains. You think they're watching us? They see everything. Hey, we are already at the beach. Yeah, sure. Best we take off our shoes? -It doesn't matter. No, what's going on here? Your mother ain't here? Who is this? Son of a bitch. Fuck, how to find anything in this mess! Charge: …order the defendant to immediately return trailer Nr.8 on the camping site to its proper state. Sum in dispute: Euro 3564,- What are you doing there? This is Sin, a friend from rehab. -Lonchen. My Lonchen. Ok, Mum, we're just passing through. You know where my passport is? What do you want with your passport? -Go on vacation, pretty simple. Where to? -Mum, stop asking! Help me! It has to be here! What happened to your eye? How come you care about me? I always did. Come on. Shut up and leave me alone, ok? Too late, we won't make it. Shit, fuck, man. What do we do now? You can spend your vacation here. Yes sure, great idea! Terrific! It's really not a bad idea. We stay overnight and fly tomorrow. On turkey, or what? -We have to go through it, anyway. At least, we've got one day down. It's like in Eppenhain. Loony's home. Psycho-club. Why are you so rude to your mother? She doesn't understand anything. She's such a victim. At least she lets you stay here. At my home they won't let me in. That's over. Why? I am too big a disappointment to them. They don't trust me anymore. They will only hospitalize me. What's their problem? Are they crazy? Do you want a drink? -You can say "you" to her. No, thank you, we're detoxing. Except from alcohol. Do you also take this stuff? -YOU! Yes, she has also taken it. And your parents? -My parents? Her father is a doctor. A doctor. Can't they help you? -Mum, we help ourselves. And how? We fly to an island by the sea. Who's going to pay for that? -Me! I've got the money. For both of us. Look. The tickets to Greece are really cheap. Book directly at Theon Air, we'll bring you directly to the sea. Sin knows the place. She's already been there. With my mother on holidays. But why do you have to travel by plane? It's so dangerous. Can't you take the train? It is an island. Illy! -Gee, Sin, that's not funny. We have a reason to celebrate. Sure. During sleep you won't notice it so much. What? -The pain. Good night. I will come later. Another 8 hours, 8 hours makes the first day. In 24 hours you are at the sea, keep on going, Sin, just keep on going Sin, keep on, just keep on and sleep, don't think, sleep, sleep, stop thinking, stop thinking. Sleep, just sleep, Sin. What are you staring at? Sorry. I'm sorry. Illy? Move away. My Lonchen. Let it all out. All out. Yes, right. Everything will be fine. Oh my god, I can't take it anymore, Mum. I am done. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine now, I'm here. Mum is here, come on. I'll heal you, come on. My sweetheart. My poor child. Poor child. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. I'm here. I'm always here for you. Always. Quit staring. Get up. Go and get her blanket. Here. Not like this. Sweetheart, everything is good now. Everything is good now. Well, that's it with your vacation. -Why? Well, Ilona can't travel like this. She needs to recover first. In such a state I won't let you go. What a crazy idea, anyway. An island by the sea. And also by plane. Nonsense. Illy, you can't leave me now, I am here only because of you. Illy, we have a plane to catch. I feel like shit. -No, Illy, we have to get out of here! Illy, we have to leave! Can't you just leave her alone? You can see she's sick. At least you can wipe the floor, while you're on vacation here. Lonchen. My Lonchen. I protect you. I'm here. Sleep now, sleep. Dear Sinja. We wish you a happy birthday. Stay strong and hold on. We are all with you and deeply believe in you. Next holidays you are with us again. Kiss, your Mum. Illy. I've found a prescription. I'll go to the drugstore and get some Codis for you. And then we fly, right? Illy, you have to look for your passport in the meantime. Do you understand? You have to look for your passport. Yes, ok. What is it? -Nothing. Hello. I'd like to pick this up for my grandma. One moment, please. Your ID, please. No, no. That was quick. Well, we are not that far. Goodbye. -Thank you. Goodbye. A young man was arrested in Frankfurt yesterday evening, with 200 prescriptions from the same doctor. Are you involved in that? Did you sign the prescription? No statement without my lawyer. Well. Don't get your hopes up. The prosecutor knows all the tricks to find out the truth. Your signature here, please. Gone, gone, gone. Everything is gone. Where did she go? Where is she? -Everything is gone. Everything. The house, and the child... I've lost everything. I've done everything wrong. Oh my God. She'll be back soon. When did she leave? -I do not know. I can't remember. I was never there. I was never there for her. Every mother is there, no matter how but she is. What do you know. You've got no idea at all. "Every mother is there, no matter how!" Go home then, if there is always someone there for you. What do you want here anyway? What do you want? Want to see how it is to live in the filth? You've got no idea at all. It's your own fault taking these damn drugs. Nobody asked you to take them. You've got no reason at all. Take your fucking vacation alone. We don't need your fucking money! What a nerve! The nerve! To come here, fancying yourself as someone better. What cheek! Get out! Get out of here! Mommy? Just one more night, Sinja. Just another night ... and you made it. Only one more day. Hey, Sin, open the window! We go to the sea. Leon has a car. We don't need passports or anything. We'll drive today and in the morning we're at the beach. You still don't believe me? You are feeling better again, what? Here. I've got only one day left. Then be happy. Hey Sin, we will detox. But in the south, where it is warm. Chilly on the beach, you know? We lower our dose slowly. It's really crazy here during the winter! "Cold turkey", Sin! You are totally nuts! We don't need to be as radical as you are. We will make it, too. Differently. We just take a vacation to the sea. Easy, ok? I missed you. Sin! Hey Sin! Wait! Sin!
