Doctor Mack You are late. What's wrong? Too cold? Let me give you a big warm hug. Do you think I am going to help you for nothing? Let's get the job done first. Can we go now? Chi, why don't you join us? Stealing sleeping pills is just kid stuff. I, tiger, will soon be in charge of this neighbourhood. Can you handle it. - Let me help you. - No, thanks. The yellow one. Don't make the mistake. Are you looking for a boyfriend? I'm a nice guy. May, you don't need to come with me. It isn't convenient to come with your school uniform on. Oh yes, but... I'll be fine. They told me... It is easy to get rid of it in the first two months. Ok. I'll wait you downstairs then. Be careful. Jesus is your salvation. Young miss, where are you going? Qur car is over there. Tank, I've told you not to wait for me. I can take the bus home. You wouldn't know how to take the bus? Your dad will give me hell. You better come with me. You have promised not to tell my dad where I've been. Take care of yourself then. Okay, go now. How much each? Two dollars a shot. Give me one, please. Jesus is your salvation. Damn you! I'd told you to get lost. I'll kick your butt out, I promise, and burn your church. You're such a bully. None of your business, bitch. Don't let me see you around here again. Stop the robbers, stop them. I think there is a robbery. Police! Freeze! Don't touch me! Police! Freeze! I'm the royal hk police shooting champion for 7 years, and they call me the hk dirty Harry. I can shoot right on target any where I want. So I think you better put your gun away and surrender. Sir, can you really see your target? Have a little confidence in the royal hk police? I know... But your hat is covering your eyes. You put down your gun first. Or I am going to blow his head off. I'll give you one last chance. I'm going to count to 3, and you better put down your gun. I am counting now. Three! Officer call an ambulance. Find someone to call the ambulance. Quick. The cop shot me without counting right. He count it in his mind. We can't wait for an ambulance. Officer, find a vehicle. Hold onto the ice and don't let him bleed. Don't worry I know first aid. Excuse me. Miss, are you okay? I am fine. Are you sure? I have a car. Officer, you drive. I don't have a driving licence. How many times have I told you to get one. I'll drive. A cop without a driving licence? What are you saying? How can you be cop without a driving licence. I'm undercover all the time... Miss, you don't have a driving licence either. Come back, miss... Nurse, this man's been shot. The bullet is still in his head. He needs a blood transfusion immediately. Prepare 500cc "unmatched". Have you reported it to the police yet? Officer tam, this man has been shot. Don't waste time. Let fix him up first. Where are you going? What do you think you are doing? Are you the doctor on duty? What happened? Nurse chan. He needs a blood transfusion, or he won't survive. Can you take this responsibility? He asked for "unmatched". You know there is only one pack for emergency use. And you have to ask for Dr. Jaw's permission. Where is doctor jaw? He's making round with the students. You cannot disturb him. In this case, the doctor on duty has the right to make decision. Get the blood ready. 500cc "unmatched". - Take him inside. - But who will look after these patients? I am a doctor. I'll take care of them. Doctor so, you are fully responsible for this. You liked that Richard Gere movie. You're horny. No way. I have a lot of his lasar discs at home. Really? You took care of all the patients so fast? I sent all the critical patients to the other hospital. And I gave my business card to the rest. They will come to see me tomorrow. He has had the blood transfusion and his condition is stablizing, then we will do a computer scan now. I'll be back in a second. Have you just finished your internship. Yes, I have been on m.O. For only three days. This is my first night shift. Does it show? No experienced doctor be stupid enough to take a responsibility. Why did you use the "unmatched" without my permission? Is the patient ready for computer scan? Anytime. Medical work and police work are both sacred mission. What time do you finish work? The bullet is located right at the centre of the frontal skull. Any idea how to perform the operation? Cut off the skin and plug it out. It shouldn't be that easy. There are two reasons we shouldn't do this. First, the bullet is police-evidence. By using the pincers will damage it. - That's... - Damaging the evidence. Second, you can see the bullet end is flat with the skull surface. If we fail to plug it out, there is a big chance of pushing it in even deeper. So we should make an incision, around the bullet on the skull, take out the piece of bone with the bullet and give it to the cops. So it will make everyone happy. It will damage the skull layer and the cells around it. There may be some side effects. The patient will have a running nose the rest of his life. He is a robber. He's lucky to still be alive. Thank you. Doctor jaw, the brain surgery department says they are unable to arrange a surgeon to perform the operation. What can we do? Well... I'll do it later. Thanks. Wait a second. I've almost forgot to introduce to you. My best friend whom I hadn't met for over 10 years. I know. You are doctor lau mack. How are you? You're my idol. Dr jaw and you were the two top guns in medical school. I had seen your picture in the old boys association. Me too. Thank you. It is incredible, still so famous after all these years. What if we ask doctor lau to say and give us some advice on this case? Yes! I really want to stay but I have to go with this officer to the police station. So I'm so sorry. Anyway. My clinic is just nearly by on lantern street. If you have any problem, come to see me. Thank you very much. Are you two going out? Don't be embarrassed. I can tell by watching hairstyles. Have you slept together yet? I suggest you to take the HIV test, for safety sake. Thank you very much. Your eyes are quite yellow. Liver problem. Thank you very much. Thank you. You are right. The patient will suffer from side effects. No more advertising? Let's go are you really leaving? I think everyone wants you to stay. Give them some advice. Right! I do have an idea. Don't fool around. Could be fatal. My method is a lot simpler. I'm not sure if you would buy it. But I tell it anyway. Excuse me, can I use your head? I'll open up the skin and use some pincers to hold the end of the bullet. Then cover them with dry ice. That freezes the bullet. When the bullet hit the skull, it was a heated object. Now we freeze it with dry ice. The bullet will contract rapidly. The bullet can be taken out easily. Thank you. That's right. But we may damage the bullet. You are correct. However, it is none of our business. We are doctors. Our duty is to find the best way to save the patient. If it is the problem for the police? It is their own problem, right, mr officer? If the doctor insists, there is nothing we can do about it. Let's go, mr officer. Do you know what you have just said? Dry ice and all! Dr. jaw is the top surgeon in hk. He is the best! And you, doctor la... And you're just a small potatoe at lantern street. It's like heaven and hell. So what? What? But those students are such big fans. If I leave without a word or two, they would be very disappointed. So I just made up something to say. Is that right? You might kill my witness. They don't wear underclothes. Not this hospital. No wonder you want to be a doctor. How come it hit his head? I saw it. Who is your image designer? That hat betrays your cover. I use this hat to hide my eyebrows. People recognise me by my eyebrows. You always order the suspects to "stop running" and "freeze". Has anyone ever actually stop and freeze? No. So, what is the use? I have to do it. Both of us are running I must differentiate myself from the suspect. Look at me. True, you do look like a criminal sometimes. Do we have dry ice? Get me some dry ice? What? Dry ice? Yes, dry ice. Hello hi Did you just get back? Yes sorry. I couldn't go to the party with you. It's alright. Everybody was talking about you tonight. They bet on you winning "surgeon of the year" award again. I don't think so. Before the main course was ever served. The news came... That you have just performed an amazing operation. Now the whole medical field is talking. About what? Something about the "dry ice" treatment. They asked where did you get this incredible idea. No big deal. Do you like the flowers? You know I don't like roses. I gave them to the hostess. She liked them a lot. She thought it was your apology. See, how can I do without you? Can I come over tonight? No, we are both tired. Go to sleep earlier. I just want to talk. Tonight... I saw lau mack again tonight. Shit. I'm really tired. Let's talk at the office. Good night. Good night. Look at the colour! What's wrong? This looks pretty sick. Who says? You better come back tomorrow. I'll give you a check up. I don't think so. You are a nurse. You should know fingernails is an indicator of your health. I know! Do you know where is doc. Lau clinic, please... Crazy I am. You're looing for me? Hey, where are you going? Thank you. Go... 4,9... Go, 4, 9... Shit! Lost again... damn it. How could it be anything else? Stupid race. - Excuse me. - Kan! Get lucky again. You've get caught because of illegal gambling. Yes! Doctor lau. Have you had lunch yet? Look. Can you explain last race's result? What do you think of race 87? What's matter with you? Any tips? What are you doing? We are just chatting. You can talk to him in jail. Are you looking for me? - Well... - How's your quinella? Lost it. Bad breath again! Indigestion? Tell me. When does your niece coming back to work? Isn't the beauty pagent over yet? Get tired of this old bag now? I wish she was here too. I am getting tired of dealing with your landlord. You lost at the race again. There goes the rent. Should ask the patients to pay up from now. Monthly check up for the ladies again? Who's first? I'll help you to register. - It's not fair. - You go first. It's not fair. Come on. Give me a break. Are you in a hurry? No. Can you look after those patients for me? Me? It is simple stuff like gonorrhoea, syphilis... Yes, I can handle it. Should have hired more help long time ago. See, it is as busy as a market place here. What is your name, doctor? My surname is so. Doctor so. Doctor so, here is your robe. Thank you. I can take care of myself. What is this? The chained-gang runs loose? - Aunty. - Yes the lady needs a blood test. Can you help her? Okay. Doctor lau, miky and I have settled some score. We need your place for a while. Yes, doctor la... You clinic is right at the neutral zone. Perfect place for peace talk. Sure, and the cops would never guess... - There are cops all over the street. - Get lost... You don't need to go. You'll be talking about the neighbourhood welfare anyway. Then people here have the right to know. You can talk in front of us. Your turn. Me? Time to work. Come, this way. So wasting. I want to practise here with you. Thanks. Getting old, must write everything down before I forget it. I want to work for you. How come? You are a medical officer already. Let me see. You have a dream. You want to help the poor and save the world. Say, go practise medicine in Africa and you want to win a nobel prize before 50. I have thought of joining the un medical corp to Africa. But I had stopped thinking of the nobel prize since I was 16. Good for you. Thanks. But then, you are not suitable to be my student. Wow, no idea. So. You talking to me? Excuse me. Your salary will not include room and board no maternal leave. That's fine for me. Are you hiring me then? You're talking too much time. Uncle ho, you look perfectly fine. I never say I am sick. I'm here to collect. Why didn't you say so? I wouldn't mind to have a check up. I have to go. Thank you. Sorry, I can't remember. Didn't she come for monthly check up? Who? Let me read it. Let me read it. That's who! If you want to meet her, just go over there. Why hide and peep here? She's just a hooker! She is different she chooses her client. What is this person? You must be new. K.t. Is the well-known Hong Kong scum bag. It's better to put this bastard in the electric chair. Doctor la... Do you think this pose works? Like two clowns screwing. I know you can do it. I really don't know how he could do it. He always has affairs with married women. Your friend Roger blongs to the same species. Good morning, doctor jaw. Lau mack and I interned under the same doctor. One time, our superior asked me to prescribe some medication to a patient. And, he gave me the wrong name. The patient reacted to the drug and suffered suffocation. Mack took instant action and suggested to perform an larynx operation. To cut a hole at the patient's throat and let him breath. I had warned him. We interns have no right to make such decision. But he didn't listen to me, he saved the patient's life eventually. But the patient decided to sue the hospital after he recovered. Our supervisor blamed me and asked me to take full responsibility. I thought I was finished. But mack came through for me. He took all the blame without a hitch. That's why he didn't graduate in school. We seldom saw each other since then. He got a British commonwealth licence somewhere. You can't get him out your mind because you feel guilty? I never feel guilty about it. I graduated with honours. The chairmanship of the medical board is within my reach. I'm one of the beautiful people in town. I rub elbow with the rich and famous. Why should I worry about a nobody? Because he is more talented than you. Roger! Never mind. You'll feel better if you admit that you hate this man. Less is more and more is less. Perhaps you may not find it relevant. The main content of yin and Yang. The sky is Yang. Yin represents the death. People can understand the mystery of yin and Yang. They will see the light from the dark. Nobody understands. The highest level of all science is philosophy. Only two and a half persons understand this theory. You and me. Who's the "half"? What "half"? You said only two and half persons can understand your theory. You and me. So who is the "half"? Remember once... I sent someone for punishment to stay in a lontuary for three nights. He dropped out of the class afterwards. Roger jaw? That's him. He has never agreed with you. I thought so too. But lately he came to my office and offered to organise all my research materials. You know that I never use a computer. It seems like he is seeing some light. Anyway, we have both done our homework for a year. After we cross check each other, we can announce this most revolutionary thesis. It'll be the biggest surprise to the world that Hong Kong can produce 2 medical geniuses. You and I may be the first Chinese doctors to win a nobel prize. Professor bao! I know we shouldn't indulge in glory. But allow me a touch of vanity after 40 years in the field. Right? Let's celebrate. This sure is a very delicate little thing. I know you always have an eye on it. I just want to take a look... Don't even think about it. Don't be so mean. I'll pour it for you. - I'm going to make it this time... - You witch doctor. My friend wei is in hospital after the abortion. What abortion? I don't even know you. Who are you looking for? You sure don't know me. Even his name stinks dr lau mack. You are looking for doctor lau mack? It is in his office. You need an abortion. Take off your clothes and pop in. You are doctor lau mack? Yes, I am. Something went wrong with my friend wei's abortion. I here for vengeance. I haven't done any abortion lately. Maybe the doctor upstairs did it. My mistake then. I remember you. You were the rich little girl who lent us the car to take us to the hospital. Yes. My name is may. Don't call me a rich little girl please! How romantic to practise in a slum like this. You have a heart-burn, right? Yes. How do you know? Don't eat too many mangoes and drink more water. Where's aunty? Aunty? Aunties' niece has won the beauty pageant, and she is taking aunty for a trip. They have both resigned. Big trouble then! Who's going to do the work here? Roger mack, do you have time? Let's find a quiet place to talk. For 10 years, the Chinese medicine society has worked on a research to cross-study western and eastern medical theories. If the research is successful, it will be the most revelating news all over the world. Lately... The society is interested in bao's research. Why don't you go see bao yourself. Bao told me to find you. I have talked to the society. I suggest to set up a foundation under bao's name. This Sunday morning is the medicine society 100th anniversary party. I will announce this plan to the public. It will depend on bao, is he willing to announce his research? Mack, you know what. Two months ago, they had decided to force bao to retire and they had planned to stop all his anniversary. This is a wonderful opportunity to save bao. He will also receive any support as long as he wants. In fact, medicine research should belong to everyone. It has to be announced sooner and later. However, you will announce it for bao. Okay, no problem. I have the research. It will give it to you in the party. I look forward to seeing you how you take care of bao. I have said long ago, we should work together someday. Doctor la... Doctor jaw. I have to go. Remember to come on Sunday. Is doctor jaw leaving already? I forgot to say thanks to him. Remember that gunman I shot down that night. Thanks to jaw, he survives. He can even talk. It's amazing. Aren't you on duty? It's lunch time, my dear. You better be more careful. Don't you worry someone may recognise you? Doctor la... May, please join us. - Okay. - Please sit down. Are you going to eat here? Yes. What do you want? Is this Hemingway's novel yours? Yes. Can I borrow it when you finish? I've read the Chinese translated version. It's about a group of young writers in Paris. Very interesting. No problem. Let me introduce. Sam so is my new colleague. This is may. Lok Mei. How do you do? Why are you still here? Doctor so has just hired me as a registration nurse. That's your idea. I want to get some experience. I am going to study medicine. Don't you need to go to school? Rich man's daughter don't have to go to school? Stop it. Doctor lau, come to my place for dinner sometime. So you don't need to eat out every day. - Here is your "take out". - That's great! Thanks. I am too busy today, I usually cook! I have to go. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. I've told you before. She is no ordinary whore. She even reads book like highway. It's Hemingway! What do you know? She speaks fluent english and French. Mei came from mainland and she is an orphan. She wanted so much to go to school and hadn't any chance. She reads a lot. Everything she knows is self-taught. Do you want to read it first? Who cares about english novel? He doesn't know anything. He doesn't know how to swim, how to drive not even using the bank machine. He is a blockhead. Why you didn't introduce me to her? She didn't even look at me. I don't know if I would be invited to her place. Can't you tell? If a girl is interested in a guy, she'll deliberately ignore him in front of others. Do you know her pretty well? Why did she ask you to her place? Why didn't she ask me? What did you do with her? It is none of your business. Did you visit her before? How many times? It is none of your business. You bastard. Man here it is. Thanks. Professor bao. Why don't you talk to professor bao? This is a great graduation party, isn't it? After the graduation, you will be a real doctor. You have to practise what I had taught you. I have been a doctor for over ten years. Is that right? Excuse me, sir. It is very impolite for me to come into the men's washroom. You must have your reasons. K.t. Good news. Secretary pak is coming to our party. Well done. Don't worry. I've reported it to the police already. Meet a friend of mine. Mack, come over. May I introduce my best friend k.T.? He is the chairman of bao's foundation. I know him. From the magazines. Doctor, lau mack. Dcotor la... Roger told me that you have been helpful. It is my pleasure to help professor bao. Thank you. I can arrange k.T. To sit next to secretary pak. But I will never sit with him. I will sit somewhere else. Don't be so upset. Rose is still staying in the hospital. I can't pretend nothing'd happend. Jamie, you can do it. You must. Roger, I am sorry. I can't. He assaults your consin. Tommy said he will come after him. I really don't know what he is capable of doing. Excuse me. Secretary pak is here. Is that right? Excuse me... Welcome. Assasination! K.t. You son of a bitch! Tommy stop. Don't make it worse. Is there a doctor? Secretary pak is injured. Call the police. No camera... You will be fine. Let me see your wound. Please find me some rice. Ice? - Take it easy. - Lcel call the hospital. There is one more casuality. Call for one more ambulance. Thanks. Take over here. I need to go with the ambulance. Okay. Do you know the doctor who did first aid on the boy scout? Doctor jaw? Doctor jaw? Yes, it's him. No, itsn't him. Yes! How is secretary pak doing? His condition has been stablized. Bullet locates between ischium and the end of lumbar vertebra. We haven't had an operation schedule yet. The other victim is a boy scout wong Sam... Did you do first aid on him? Yes... It was quite chaotic. Secretary and scout were shot at the same time. Hi... How is the scout doing? He is stable. That means he's ok. Yes! Here is your glove. You bastard! Be honest! Roger, did you just say fifty percent chance? Yes, fifty percent paraplegia. What do you think Tony? If Roger thinks there is fifty percent chance. I believe he is very confident. I would say there is only thirty percent chance. Thirty percent. Are you lau mack? Yes. How did you know? Do you know who I am? Sure, otherwise I wouldn't know where to find you. That's not what I mean. I am Roger jaw's girlfriend. He talks about you a lot. I guessed right. Who else could be so arrogant! Roger jaw's girlfriend. It is logical. I don't believe in love anymore. With him, I know where the bottom line is! I don't want to talk about it, ok! You can go now. This is great! I like this party. It is quite interesting. What is happening? The church is having a party. Excellent. Come have a look! What? Over there, look. "Each time we meet, lord." "I find complete love... lord." "Without your sweet love." "What would life be?" Did you say your son and your mother are living in Macau? Yes. It is my fault. I wasn't able to take care of my wife. Don't blame yourself. I don't think it is your fault. A few days ago, my son called me from Macau. He told me I don't need to worry about him anymore. He also asked me if I feel lonely in Hong Kong. Why didn't I find... A girlfriend. After I talked to him, I was so moved. You have a great son. I really want to meet him. Are you sure? It is my pleasure to meet you tonight. In front of our god... Don't listen to him! He is lying. Did he tell you he has a 10 year old son at elementary school? Oh yes. You can do better than this. When we went out three years ago, he told me the same story too. - Stop. Don't listen to her. - Stupid. It's true? - Of course it's true. - No! Don't believe this guy. Let's go. I also have a six year old mentally handicapped daughter. Zin, why are you here? I come for you. Don't you remember? It has been one year already. Remember to return to my clinic tomorrow. Maybe I should go... Why don't you stay with zin? Take care of her. Okay. Is love give or take? The little box I just given to doctor lau contained some ash. This ash belongs to a girl he likes. Doctor lau and his classmate fell in love with the same girl. Doctor lau understand he was not a good husband. So he gave her up. Later, she married his classmate. Two years later, she had bone cancer. She asked doctor lau to look after her but it was still too late. Before the girl passed away, she asked me to store all her ashes. Lau'll receive a proportion of her ashes in her memorial every year. She wanted to ensure that doctor lau remember her all his life. - Is this love or hate? - Help I heard someone calling for help. Are you okay? - What are you doing? - It is not your business. Freeze. Police! Freeze! Get him. Just some scratches. Sam, take him back first. Easy. Carefully. Everybody, get off. What did you see? - I just returned... - What about... What did you see? - Officer chau. - I just came back from... I think it is a very serious case. It may relate to religion. Are you going to do the investigation for me? His eyes are hurt. There is blood all over the place. Call the cop, then. Let's go inside and take a look. Don't worry. The royal hk police can gurantee your safety. You can relax and tell me slowly. I was returning... I haven't asked you the question yet. What did you see? When I was returning... - That's it! - Have you missed anything? - No. - You must be missing something. Let us take a walk to refresh your memory. It is dangerous to promote gospel in this area I am willing to do it. Just I hope the church will open for worship on time. Thank you, doctors. You're welcome. Doctor la... What is the problem with gospel promotion? What are you talking about? He accepts most of the people. What? Brother-in-law? I am sorry, doctor la... I am so sorry. No, you don't need to apologize. So. From now on, you are responsible for zin. She is your first patient. But now what you can do... Is to take her home I'm sorry. This way? Do you find this patient very confusing? No. Roger jaw is your brother in law. Doctor lau and he are both excellent doctors. Why did they put you in my hands? The ashes I gave to doctor lau tonight, are my sister's ashes. So your sister was the girl they both loved. Do you know what's wrong with me? No, I don't know. Just like my sister. I have bone cancer. Bone cancer? I and my sister are so alike, even my fate. It's my idea to ask doctor lau to look after me. I would rather die in the hand of someone who cares for me. Somehow in my heart, doctor lau is my brother in law, not Roger jaw. Sometimes, I think I am too selfish that he would have both sisters die in his hand. He can't take it, so he passes you to me? No, in fact, he would rather stay along my side till the very end. Why did he ask me to be your doctor then? He said... Your care would be as good as his. Do me one more favour. You know I'll help you. Not as a deal. Anything I can do for a patient, I'll do it. This is my first principle as a doctor. What is your problem? This bullet... Is right at the nerve of vertebra and the sacrum. Generally speaking, the nearest the cut, the less risk. However, this spot is buried by various nerves. Say what's the risk for permanent paralegia? 30 percent. Are you going to do the operation yourself? Yes! That's better. 40 percent. Thanks. If we see it this way, a to b is the shortest distance. But not the safest. The bullet is also by the end of the rectum. If we can do the incision inside the rectum, we can stay away from all delicate nerves. That's to use the endoscope. Put it in by the anus. Make a cut and pick the bullet out from there. Excellent. You don't need to thank me. Promise me one thing. Be a doctor and not a medical broker. How do you feel about the operation? The success is due to my persistence to search for a solution. Perhaps it is my luck. At the critical moment, I was able to come up with the safest way to perform this operation. Thanks. The hospital are all the doctors involved... You are kiding? Are praised. What? Dad. That Roger jaw is a scum. How do you know? We don't like him at all. However, he is a great surgeon. You and him are after the chairmanship of the medical board, right? If the blood does not flow through this artery smoothly, you may experience some unpleasant feelings such as headache. Before we talk about the pulmonary arterys, do you have any questions? That's good. Let us read all together. Kin ming. Ng la. There's something I don't understand. What? I've seen zin's file. She is in the final stage of bone cancer. Why did you pass her to me? A patient needs a doctor. Are you a doctor? - Yes. - That's why she is your patient. Chun cow. Chun cow. Shar ha. Shar ha. They are the four artery systems you learn tonight. Is it my turn yet? No. You are the diagram of the urinary bladder. I have a French test tonight. Bonjour, madamme, jesuis, ahchio French is too difficult for you. Je suis chinoise they are connected to the inner organs. She is hopeless. Can you stop moving around? I can't teach! Forget it. Class dismissed... Try to memorize the system. See you next time. What I am going to do? Have you tried everything? No. So there is hope. How romantic you are. As you know Mei will go to France, you study French, too. Cestlavie, moncherie uncle wong. Take it easy. - Give me more. - This is the last time for this month. - More please! - More? Methadone is so expensive these days. I'm out of money. Uncle chi. This is the last time. I don't think I can help you anymore. Just kidding. Come to see me if you need help. Don't sleep in the park. It is getting cold. I don't think methadone can help you. Do I really need help? I don't know. I was watching you give out the medicine. I ask myself... You do that... How true are you? The point is, I know you've involved lots of charity. Functions like balls and gala shows. I believe you are Sincere. But to me. I don't know what charity is. I am only a doctor. My job is to heal people's illness. Just like... A watch-maker. If he see's a broken watch, he'll repair it naturally. It wouldn't be for charity or anything. I have nothing to say then. What are you afraid of? Right? I come to tell you something. Words are out that taught Roger on pak's operation. You know he hates to lose face. He will "the thief cries thief" I come to warn you. But now I know I don't need to worry about it anymore. You are so self-assured. You don't really care one way or another. You haven't answered me what are you afraid of? What are you teasing me for? Zin's case is so cut and dry. She's going to die. One more month, maybe. Any intern can tell you that. A medical genius like you should ever know better. How you thought of a bone operation? I may be inexperienced. But I'm not stupid. Firstly, the cancer has spread over a large area. She's so weak, an operation may be risky. Secondly. How much time we can buy, even if the operation... Is successful? You tell me? Three to six months. What difference does it make? You are her doctor. You tell me! The longer she lives, the more she suffers. She is such pain. But, you can see her more. I thought because she is your ex-lover's sister. You don't wanna see her suffer so you let me take care of her. But now I understand. You don't care about her at all. The first rule for a doctor is not play god. And think you can control life and death. We are not different from a shoe-maker. We do our best to repair the shoes. When they are beyond repair, we have to throw them away. Zin is not a shoe. She is a human being. And she's someone you fancy. Have you gone through her file? Look. Have I missed something? Here. She is still a virgin. It is none of your business. I'm looking for the contact lenses. - Give me a hand. - Yes... contact lenses. Where? Over here. I told you they were going to fight. Pay up. That's no fight! Someone beats someone and someone got beaten. That's not fighting. What are you talking about? I'm not going to talk to you. You're lose. - Give money. - You're so ignorant. Don't touch me? Give me the money. Good evening, officer chi... Are you on duty? Spying? Don't move. Where are you going? Go up. Where to, to heaven? To get laid, of course. Not for exercises for sure? Don't talk to me like that. Do you understand? Going up for girls. Shame on you. Where's your l.D. Card? Are you joking, officer? You don't have one? My pager is beeping. - I have to make a phone call. - Oh yes? Where are you going? What? Where are you going? To Pearl's place. Pearl's place! - Pearl, you know. - Pearll don't you go to Mei's? No way, let me tell you. Pearl does the best job in this slum. Don't talk dirty with me. Get lost! Yes don't trick me - sure, I promise - And go to Mei's instead. Are you working late again? - Go home? - Where are you going? Where are you going? Going up. To where? To Mei's. What for? None of your business. You spineless scum. Don't you know Mei is going to be my girlfriend? You're crazy. Don't go near her. So messed up with me once this afternoon. Don't make me mad again. You cold-blooded beast. You want a fight? I don't want to talk to you, blockhead! - I'm going up right now! - Try it and I'll shoot you. - Come on. - Are you sure? I am sure! You better go home. I will forget the whole thing. I'm not going anywhere. If you want a fight, stupid cop. "Freeze, stop running." That's all they taught you at the police academy? Is that the basic law in the police book? Order the suspect to stop. And he'll stop voluntarily and wait for you to lock him up. I don't care if you insult me. But you can't insult the royal Hong Kong police. Get off me. So? Get off. How dare you! Stop. Please. Why don't you go home first? Please. You charcoal face, you're nuts. You are a good man. Go home. Don't worry. I'm done for tonight. Excuse me. I want you to service me. How much? Eighty dollars? Someone told me it is two hundred dollars now. That's a lot. Please, stop it! Of course, I will pay for your service. You said you need money to go to France to travel and see the world. I'll pay for exclusive service every night until you have enough money to go to France. Two hundred per night? Is it enough? Exclusive service? Okay, come on. I don't actually want it. I just don't want you to serve other man. Let's not talk about money. Why don't we make love for once as friends? I'm sorry. I'll not do it. Money or no money. Who is the hottest on billboard this week? Him! Right... Whose photo has the highest selling rate? Him! Who has the most fans on earth? Him. Right! Who makes us come here today? Him! I can't hear you! Who? Him! Him! Who is he? A singer a singer? Thank you for your support. A special welcome for a group of new brothers. They are the "tatoo choir". What's wrong with you, doctor so. Do you have something on your mind? Let us share your problem? Yes! I have done something against my professional ethics. I fell in love with my patient. She is in the final stage of cancer. If I agree to operate on her, she'll probably live for three more months. But if I don't, she'll be gone any moment. I love to see her more. But I know it would be selfish of me. Because I know... Because the longer she lives, the more she will suffer and more pain. I really don't know what to do. How can he say it out! My son. Medicine is not just about analysis and technology. A doctor should not only rely on his logical senses, rules and procedures. You must have faith in your heart and your patient's heart. Do you understand! Praise the lord. Give me five hallelujah! Who else wants to repent? Here! You are not even a Christian. It is none of your business. I'm not talking to you yet. Can't I join now? Fine... We welcome everybody. Please go ahead. I fell in love with a hooker. Praise the lord. Give me five. But she's not you. Hallelujah! I am depressed because she is so motivated. She said she needs to make money to actualize her dream. She wants to travel to see the world. I understand why she chooses to be a hooker. But... But I hate to see her working as a one. I'm confused and I am gutless. My heart is wrenched. Brother chi... You have learned to understand and concern for her feelings. This is a good sign of true love. You have found the light already. God's light will guide you. Why didn't you tell me earlier? There's so much fun to practise here. I'm too busy having fun. I failed in body checking. The university requests me to go to hospital would you help? The final stage of liver cirrhosis. I don't think he can last any longer. Mack, thank you for your help last time. In fact, we can work together like when we were at school. I can recommend you to work in our hospital. If you need research fund, I can get it for you. You just can't forget bao's research results. Roger. Can we go now? We... I have given up on this man. But I hope you will not let me down. What? You know what I am talking about. I'll give you a chance. To make a very important decision. I will count to 3. One. Two. Three. What's it about? Do you know him? Oh, you are here. - What? - Zin is in the hospital. How are you doing? I've tried to be tough but has to give in. The cancer is spreading too fast. Her left leg needs to be amputated immediately. Otherwise... Does she know about it? I haven't talked to her yet. How will you talk to her? I'm her doctor. I know how to do it. It's not your business. I know it is a tough decision for you. The other doctor will explain what is my alternative. At this moment, I think I don't need any rational decisions. Do you know something? My happiness is built on your pain. The more you are puzzled, the more I feel you care for me. It's a great feeling! I do not care about the operation anymore. Do you know why doctor lau asked you to look after me now? I don't understand how he can be so calm. Doesn't he have any feelings? "Crazy..." "Crazy for feeling lonely." "I'm crazy..." "Crazy for feeling so blue." "Crazy..." "For thinking that my love could hold you." "I'm crazy for trying." "Crazy for crying." "Crazy for loving you." I should have given it all to you long time ago. My sister made you suffer too long. I apologize for her. I am too wild myself. I knew there is no hope for me and I forced you to take me in as your patient. Yes, you are a bit coild. But not everyone can treat me like that. Can I be wild once more? Can you promise to do one thing for me after I am gone? "I bless the day I found you." "I want to stay around you" "and so I beg you." "Let it be me." "Don't take this heaven from one." "If you must cling to someone," "now and forever." "Let it be me." "Each time we meet love." "I find complete love..." "Without your sweet love." We sing again, okay? If you face a similar situation, do you know how to handle this time? I'm sorry. I'm too naive. Now I understand. You are using this chance to teach me how to be a conscious and unselfish doctor. I must have disappointed you. No. There is no completely rational and unselfish doctor. Because we all are human. Human feeling will only become more and more numb. Let me show you a way. Stand up here. Face this direction and shout it out loud. Try it. Can I do it here? No. I've acrophobia. Don't be afraid. Shout! Try your best. Can you hear? There's a lot of feedback from everywhere. You are not the most unlucky person on earth. I come up here everytime after a patient dies. Are you crazy! Go to hell! Are you leaving, doctor lau? Where is Roger? Doctor jaw has gone already. He said professor bao is getting better, isn't he? No, his temperature is dropping unreasonably fast. Deep fried pork steak. It's tasty. Stop talking. Crab with wine... Doctor lau? Do you remember me, doctor lau? Doctor... I'm tong ching. - Do you remember me? - I don't think so. Doctor, you are my saviour. - Can you get up first? - Thank you for saving my life that time. Otherwise, I would not able to make it. I know, I know. I join the gangs because I need the money to send home for my mom eyes surgery. The police pays me to be a witness for the prosecution. Now, I can send the money to my mom back home. Thank you so much for saving my life. Can you give me a hand? Yes, what? - Let's go. - Yes. Thanks. What else do you want to do? I haven't had a woman for a long time. Woman? I'm not capable anymore but I just want to feel her and hug her. No. Lau mack. Are you going to Mei's place? It is none of your business. You bastard. Of all the girls in town, you have to pick mine. Stop it! You are crab. Tell him if you love her. You have no right to stop me visiting her. You are my friend. You should care about my feelings? Did you take the professor up yet? Who? Where to? To Mei's place! You bastard... you dirty rat... Chiu... Something's wrong. The body has no obvious injuries. He told me to give it to you. Thanks. It's like he knew he was going to die soon. One minute. I need to talk to you. Don't make it too long. Mei, marry me. - What did you say? - The police out there will frame you for prostituting. The only way is to tell them you are my wife. You can tell them we were married in China. Your wife? Not just pretending. I really want you to marry me. I love you. I'm a hooker. You don't even know me. I don't care what you are. I can't stand it anymore. I had womb cancer. I got it removed. Doctor lau did it. You've taking him wrongly. I didn't want to marry anyone. I don't care what you've done. I really don't. It's true. I'm telling you a bad news. Doctor jaw want to frame you. The medical board will hold a hearing in order to suspense your licence. Mack. Go in, don't worry. I'll make it ok. I am not worried about it. I'm excited. I want to see how the board do things. We've decided to do it legally. Of course! This hearing is only for our internal information, there isn't any legal binding at all. Doctor lau mack. We suspect you have broken the professional medical policy. You have the right not to answer any questions. However, this committee would make the final judgement, and execute it under any circumstances. Doctor lau, did you decide to answer or not to answer? I will answer the questions. Professor bao was found dead in rock Mei's home. Did you not take him to her apartment? Yes, I do. Did you go through the patient's daily report that day? What did you think of his condition at then? The temperature of the patient was decreasing too rapidly. I would think it was sort of a calm before a storm. How long could the patient live, in your opinion? No more than twenty four hours. The conditions of patient was unstable. But the decrease of the patient's temperature was quite normal. It was also a good hopeful sign. Was the patient's conditional critical? Let me put it this. There was a hint of recovery. If the patient stayed in hospital, would he have a chance to survive? You can say that. According to the autopsy, professor bao had eaten food of high cholesterol and protein content and he had drunk a large amount of alcohol. Wasn't it absolutely unsuitable for this patient? Yes. Doctor lau, do you feel regretful for what you have done? No. The hearing will adjourn now. Result will be announced tomorrow. Are you working undercover again? She is gone. Who is gone? She. Mei? She said everytime when someone fell for her she would get frightened and wanted to run away. You? Yes me. She also said before she could fulfill her dreams, she would not fall in love with anyone. With you? Yes, of course. Do you think... I am not the right person for her? Not really. That some people has this magic to lighten up things and people around them. That is the only thing you can do better than me. Me? Of course. If Mei would only meet up with more guys like you. According to what you just said, he is sort of a genius. But he has gone too far. He is hopeless and he is extremely dangerous. We have to suspend his licence at least. K.t. You son of a bitch! - Be quick... - Please! Mr k.T., how do you feel the wrong person was hit again? No comment. I hope my best friend Roger jaw will be alive. Excuse me. Incredible. No surgeons would operate on Roger. Not a matter of choice. The bullet is right between the heart and lung. It's a risky operation. It must go under more observations. It will fail easily. Too much internal bleeding, can't wait. Go get lau mack, he must have a way. Are you kidding? Roger just did him in at the hearing. Sure he won't come! You're older than me! Check mate I lose again. Roger got shot. I've heard from the news. Wait for my return. Be quick, I won't wait. Roger? Guess who is doing you the operation? It's me. He's passed out. Save the anaethesic. What? Just kidding! No sense of humour. Anaethesic. Quch! The cut half an inch too wide. Do you have some safety pins? Are you sure? Of course not! Don't ever trust me again! Pincers. Do you know why Stevie wonder moves so much while singing? - Why? - Why? He is looking for the mic. Do you know why black guys raise chickens in the backyard? Why? To teach their kids to walk. Hey man, give me five is that right? Go to get the pincers. Where're you going? Getting the pincers. Tony, you take over. The operation is successful, but the patient is dead. - No! - Of course not. You silly goose. According to all the evidence, the committee has decided to suspend your licence. Starting today. No way. He's just saved Roger's life. Keep calm. And you got your doctor licence in an Africa country. Four years ago, this country seperated from the commonwealth. Hk does not recognise licence from this country anymore. To be precise, it's practice with a licence. So there is no licence to be suspended. But you have put up a circus like this. What for? Well, it's difficult to answer such embarrassing question. Thank you for the good time these few days. See you! At least tell us where you are going. I know you are a free spirit. And always do whatever you want to do. But you have been practising here for so long. You can't just leave like this. For everything, turn, turn, turn... We must move on. No matter what. Nothing can last forever. Take this guitar. It's your favourite. It's fine. You come over, mack. I am telling you the truth. I will never love again. You may not believe me now. You'll repeat this statement for at least a dozen time in the future. Study hard and become a good doctor. Break some hearts. I have to go. Doctor lau, can't you stay longer? I know you don't really want to go? Where are these people coming from? Do I owe you money? We know we should have paid up long ago. This money is from us to settle part of our bills. Never mind. Well... we've gotten used to your hands. We can't let another doctor touch us. You will get used to a new doctor sooner or later. Don't go. You've taken care of us for so long. We don't care if you are licenced or not. Doctor... I have a licence for you... I found a licence for you. Yes? This is a veternarian licence. Isn't it the same? Doctor lau, I know deep down you want to stay. Don't play cool. I never plan to stay forever. You are all my genea pigs. Let me help you. What are you doing here? Let me help you. No, I can take it myself. I want to! Don't start weeping, you are a grown man. Take this. What for? Africa is very sunny. Africa? You are going to Africa? I've told you not to tell. So what? He's joined the un medical corp to go to Africa. Shut up. I must say it. My licence is only valid in Africa. You are wonderful. Not really. To accept dr lau to be a registered doctor. How come? Because if they didn't do so I would sue them for allowing a non-registered doctor to perform an operation in the government hospital. It may charge them for misconduct causing danger to a patient. If you need to go, it would not be for lacking a licence. If you want to stay But if you want to stay, I hope it is not just for this licence. I'll give you a chance to make a very important decision. I'll count to 3. One. Two. Come over, Kent. My son, Kent. Have a sit. You do have a 10-year-old son? Of course, let's meet uncle, aunt... - Say hello... - He is so cute. Aunt. Is this letter for me? It is from France. Can I have the stamp? Of course. Who is it from? Let me see it. Take it easy. How is your wound? The doctor has done a great job on my operation. This operation may not mean anything to you, but it is the most important operation in my life. Take it. Are you going somewhere? At last, there is something I do ahead of you. I have joined the un medical corp to go to Africa. I am leaving tonight. Take care. Let's go down and party. Come on, quick. New year, so what? Life goes on.
