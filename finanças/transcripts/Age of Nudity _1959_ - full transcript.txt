You wanna ride one? It must be good to be an adult. If you wanna ride a motorcycle, you can just do it whenever. AGE OF NUDITY Scenario: Hisao Sasai Screenplay: Nobuyoshi Terada & Seijun Suzuki DP: Jonobe Fujioka Gaffer: Kyosa Yoshida Sound: Toshio Nakamura Art Director: Takehara Sakaguchi Composer: Chumei Watanabe Editing: Akira Suzuki AD: Kazunari Takeda Starring (Introducing) Keiichiro Akagi Kyoko Hori Bokuzen Hidari Mieko Hiro'oka Kotoe Hatsui Toshio Takahara Saburo Fujimaki Saneko Ozawa Tetsu Sento Yoshiyuki Shimizu Directed by Seijun Suzuki First, greet each other like friends! And have a fair fight! Grasshopper! Brat! That's me! You lost! Withdraw from the fight! All right! Now I'll face you! -I'll borrow this for a bit, Mr. Monkey! -So sorry! Goodbye! Hey! Th...Thieves! Hey, wait! Thieves! Are Grasshopper and The Brat here yet? Let's go one more time! This one can't seem to speed up! Looks like you got a new one, Big Brother Ken! -Make sure you switch the number on it! -Okay! All right, let's drive! Try to keep up! I'm no good at racing. The sound of a loser! No race after all, huh? Hey! Wait for us! That bastard didn't even acknowledge us! You ready? Let's race him! We beat you, so give us gasoline money! Are you mocking us? This isn't enough! They need gas money, too! We got another bike coming! Give us more money! Another one? Sabu! Looks like another race! -Let's do it! -Thanks! Hey! Thieves! Give it back! Let us borrow it! Our carburator's broken! No, don't do that! We'll give it back later. Just be patient! That's a rough biker gang. Even stealing from college students! Sabu, let's race! I need to return this bike soon. Better not use it much longer. Let's head back now! RETURNING TO THE OWNER I only got 500 yen today. It's tough to make money selling eggs. That's really low. I thought egg-sellers made at least 5000 yen a day. You're thinking of the big sellers. With me? Not a chance! Well, why not you? When I was a maid, I had more things to sell. Well, why don't you do that again? No way! -Why not? -Just 'cuz! Why, you! Answer me! Hey, Kuro! Knock it off! Sabu, split the money up like normal! Still equally divided? Even though Paako's just a newcomer? She didn't bring even in any money! Split it even for everyone! Keep doing it that way til you go independent. At that rate, how can I ever go independent? If you don't like it, we can throw you out now! All right, all right. Paako! You have to start bringing in money! How'd a newborn like you get your hands on these! Whenever you get something like this, you gotta give us a piece. A "piece?" In that case, this bag is bigger than those are. You idiot! You don't understand how merchandise works, do you? You're gonna have to learn from us! Here: You could sell these at 40 yen a pack. Maybe 50! I could sell this fancy canned food. Big brother! It comes to 1300 yen per person, with 485 yen left over! Okay, so put the remainder in with the other savings. Hey, Grasshopper! Give me 210 yen for the loan from two days ago, plus interest. It was such a short time, big brother! Can't you drop the interest? Idiot! We aren't some old-timey yakuza! We go through this every time I give you money. The food is ready! Would you go buy some whiskey, Grasshopper? Okay! Don't steal it! We've got the money, so you should buy it properly. Got it. Sabu, give him the savings. Ken, we've got some! Look! Big sister! How much did your gold tooth cost? This one? If I ever get the money, I want a gold tooth just like yours! You want to be fashionable, Kuro? It's not that! If I had one, the adults would trust me. I could stand around outside shops and no one would bother me! That's right! You'll have to be careful not to use your earnings! Yeah, but it's my dream. If I ever get the money, I'll open my own store. What about you? What's your plan? I'd spend it all real quick. I'm no good at saving money. That's why you need a plan! You're such a country bumpkin! What's that for? Hey, save your fighting for outside! I'd spend it on my wedding dress! Konjii said to enjoy life, so I think I should have a good wedding dress. The old ragpicker with the dog? The real fat dog! He's a nice old man. My mother always told me to hurry up and die. She said I shouldn't have been born. So I always wondered if it would be better if I just died. But Konjii told me it was better to live If you don't live, how can you wear a nice wedding dress? And he's right! How'd you all come to meet this old man? Oh, no reason. What? I didn't say anything. I see. Well, I'm heading back. You're going home already? I'm starving! You should come home sooner. Brat! You haven't been to school in a week. You have to go tomorrow. Yoko. Are you coming with me? I've got some business to do. Just drop me off then, would you? Mr. Konjii! Mr. Konjii! Hey, knock that off! Think it over about the barracks. Here's for this month. For the scoop, right? You probably shouldn't tell your delinquents about this. Don't write anything too bad about them. Could be bad for the villa, too. If they disperse, I'd lose my story too. Then there's another thing. I'm turning 20 in August. That talk about sailing? You are the son of a fisherman, after all. I must've inherited it. Somehow or other, I need to get on a boat. Leave it to me. I know some people in shipping at Tokyo Harbor. Just make sure you get my evidence. Is that Sabu? Where on earth do you go all day? Do you have any idea how late it is? Dry this out tomorrow. Did you hear me? I still don't get why you quit that news delivery job. Just think of all the money you gave up. I was playing. Are you listening to me, Sabu? You're so conceited. I'm so busy with work I don't have time to do the laundry properly. Why don't you think more about this household? I do have a job! You got a job? Where? Hand over your salary. If you're just playing games like a child, then say so. It drives me crazy when you lie to me like that. Mom, I'm working! See? If you have money, give it here! You're grown up now, so you have to help out. I'm using this money to go to school! You'll be a laughingstock! Poor people like us don't go to school--we just work! Whose fault is it we're poor? Yours? Dad's? It's your father's fault! He's the one who never does anything. -Dad! -Stop making such a fuss about school! All you need to worry about is bringing in money! Just focus on that! No! All my friends are going! You really are an obstinate one. Just like your father! Come talk to me for a minute. All the adults just say to be content with my circumstances. It was like that when I worked as a paperboy, too. You'll have to wait for my husband for the payment. I know you're skipping school for this, so don't bother to complain. You say he's out every day. Well, I don't have your money. Someone may come and take it anyway. I'd be careful if I were you. Maybe someone will break into your house You little brat! Apologize to me right away! Do it! You refuse? You obstinate brat! I'm sorry! Local Boy Attacks Home It's so bad, they even put your real name in the paper! Those of you advancing in school, come get your test. Those starting work, stay at your desks. Give me a test, please. Have you spoken to your parents? I'm the one going to high school! Come here. I saw what you did in the papers. It's true, isn't it? This is a critical time for you. Try to control your temper. I've said this to you many times before. I know! I'll settle that situation myself! Ma'am? She's not there! Oh, sis! Did you talk to her? I did. I gave her the paper and apologized for you. But it made no difference. You saw what was in the newspaper. Where does her husband work? Her husband? The guy who was with her. Oh, he was just a customer. She works at a dance hall. I'm sorry I couldn't be more useful. Should we go talk to the newspaper together? We could make them retract their story. I'll take you there, but it won't do any good. It's a small newspaper, so they just want the most interesting stories. But then how can I get a job? I don't like being made out as a troublemaker. Take him to the doctor's office! Why did you do that? Mabo was laughing at me! Why? I didn't bring the money to pay the school on time. He said I was lying! So you hit him? But you did pay the school eventually. Did someone go to your house? I paid with my own money! -Money your parents don't know about? -They know! Are you working? Did you get it from your mother? Why don't you answer? That's right! I'm working! Hey, Yamamoto! Is your father Yamamoto of the Metropolitan Assembly? How did you get hurt? It's from a fight! With Sabu? You seem to know a lot already. -That's when the glass window broke? -That's right. Is Sabu a troublemaker? No, he comes from a poor family, so he's just pitiful. He can actually be quite a diligent student. I pushed him too far today, though. Whatever the reason, attacking your classmates is always a bad thing. Everyone who agrees with me, please raise your hand. Don't let Sabu's presence intimidate you. Answer what you think yourself. Who thinks Sabu is in the wrong? Sabu, I think you did wrong. You should leave school and apologize to Yamamoto. Okay? The class assembly has decided. I'm sorry. Sabu, won't you stay and play? Please, won't you play with me? Just a little while. Is that okay with your parents? My dad never lets me play. And my mom only wants me to study. Do you have money? My mom steals it all. I can't help it. Your mother takes money from you? We fight about it whenever I'm home. You fight your mother? That must feel good. It isn't as good as it sounds. Why not? I wish I could fight with my parents at least once. I was thinking... I've always wanted a pet monkey. If I were just willing to fight my parents more, I could take the car and get it myself. Can't you just buy a monkey without a car? Maybe, but my parents say they're dirty, so I can't. I wish I could go somewhere that I wouldn't get scolded for everything. Come with me. Where? You'll see when we get there. There's no grown ups at all. Sounds good, right? Maybe we should have stayed at your villa, Mabo. But they said that if I didn't come along, I couldn't join your group. Let's go back. What will you do? I'm sorry. It's no big deal. All clear. Mabo, keep a look out! Help us out, Sabu! Why are you just standing there? This is no time to stand around thinking They're practically asking us to rob them. If we didn't do it, someone else would. What are you waiting for? Quickly! No one will even notice the money we take! You'll be happy once you see your own share! Someone's coming! They're taking their time! Just grab it! We'll split it up later. Let's go back. Don't be stupid. We're just getting started. We're supposed to hit ten spots tonight. Do we get a bonus for this copper electrical wire? It doesn't work like that. Show it to big brother and see what he says. Paako, here's big brother and sisters' shares. Why do you always trust Paako? We should give some to the old man. Otherwise we'll be in trouble. Big brother Ken says we have to look after each other. I'll give you his share. Grasshopper, can you return the money you got from Paako? You don't need it yet, do you Paako? How much did he borrow, Paako? I don't remember. Is this enough? Hey, what are you doing? That's mine! Mabo, here's your share! I dont need it! Keep it for yourself. But we've split it all up evenly! Don't you want to be independent? Big brother and sister! Here are your shares! What's this? A copper electrical wire. You didn't ask me about this. Since it's just a small wire, we thought we'd take it. Idiot! If we want to stay independent, we have to follow the rules. You want to do whatever you please? We'd fall apart right away. You're barely a teenager, Sabu! Big sister and I are in our late teens, so we make the rules. Remember that before you defy our rules again. Otherwise, you're out! Big sister! Do you think we did wrong, too? I do. Did you get a thrill from it? You're no different from a petty thief! Shit! Why do they call me cheeky! Even big sister! Mikki and Kuro took the money, too! They knew where it was coming from! I did it for everyone! I guess I have to go be a delivery boy again! Should we keep going? You sure launched it a long way, Sabu. But the important thing is to choose a target before you shoot. Now go see if you can kick it toward me. Here I go! Good, good! That was fun. I feel much better. It does feel good, doesn't it? You managed to get it right to me. That really felt good. Yes. You had fun too? It reminds me of when I was your age. Aren't you in love with big sister? That's what Mikki says. No, not at all! Really? Your face looks awfully nervous. I said I'm not! Then I guess it's nothing. You aren't high-class enough for big sister anyway. Bastard! Ken! Some pre-teen gangsters are coming this way. We'd better not meddle with them. What would you like? Money? Let's go. What idiots! High-speed teen yakuza extort motorists Woman Stalked and Threatened for Money Culprits said to be pre-teens Reckless Pre-teens Said to Live Together with "Older Siblings" PTA Says It Will Intervene with Reckless Pre-teens Aren't you the head of the PTA? Be more careful what you say, asshole! Someone must have betrayed us! How did the papers find out about us? Big brother! Do you know who talked? I saw Kuro and Grasshopper here. Just to buy birds, thou. To play with them? Yes. They didn't even acknowledge me. So they bought one? What's wrong, Sabu? Did you see the papers? Someone betrayed us! Where did Grasshopper and everyone go? He said Kuro had told you what shop. Yes, come quickly! Thank you. Where were you? Look at this! We got it ourselves! Come out here! I gotta ask you something. Are you picking a fight? I don't care about the bird. Who talked to the newspaper? What do you mean? Stop pretending! What's going on here? Out of my way! Stop right there! Do whatever you want with these birds. The PTA can't overlook this situation any longer. I'm sorry; I wasn't aware. If he comes back, I'll let you know right away. They're always difficult at that age. What would you do if it were your child? I'm not sure I even know. Of course it's important to let children play their games But parents can't just let their children do whatever they like. It looks like he's back! Master. So sorry to have troubled you. If it's all right with you, I'll be going. Thank you for your trouble. I'm so sorry, teacher. I'm so sorry. Sabu! Apologize! Dad! You can't make me apologize! You can't make me! You think you'll get their respect if you just bow at them! It doesn't work that way! Dad! No matter how poor we are, don't give up your dignity so easily! It's humiliating to see you bow so much! You can't apologize for me! Big sister! What have you been telling Sabu to do? Not so loud. He's always coming out here to see you! It's all right. Children have lots of things that they want to do. A person's life is a long time. It's natural to laugh and cry on the way to becoming an adult. Look! See how he's forgetting all his trouble. Isn't that cute. Old man! Why don't we all go to the ocean tomorrow? What a good idea! Big sister! Look! They're stark naked! Everybody's naked! It's like they're all the same! Are you happy, big sister? Yes, I am. You're lying! You're upset that Ken isn't here! I'm right, aren't I? You're right. Let's go! -Let's compete! -Yeah! What do you want? Where are you going? The villa! Kuro! Where did Sabu go? He went to the villa with some girl. With a weird look on her face. Go get Mikki and Paako! Hey, we get off here! What are you doing? Getting back at her. She insulted me! Get lost! Shit! What did you want to talk to me about? Why do you look at me like that? I respect your intelligence, but you're still a bad boy. What about the newspaper? Was that you? You shouldn't have tried to rough up the PTA head like that! After he said that stuff in the article? Maybe the newspaper printed a rumor. My mother says that you're a bad boy. Now that you forced me here, I think you're not just bad, but a coward. Sabu! What have you done to this poor girl? I don't care if she is a girl! Nobody says that about me! Why don't you ever think about how I feel? Should I just give up? I'll do what I want to! You promised you wouldn't talk! No, I didn't! But even when they pestered me for information, I kept my mouth shut. You promised me many times! I'm almost twenty years old! What's the big deal about that? You're still not making an honest living. It's a lot tougher than you think. Why can't you put in a word for me with the shipping company? It's not that easy. You were just using me. Using you? We were both using each other. I paid you, didn't I? You were living off what I gave you. What did you say? You agreed to get me information for an article. You thought you were superman You thought you were just bragging about your own heroism. Idiot! You agreed, didn't you? Let me give you a word of advice. If you get rough, you'll lose. It was you! I've got public opinion behind me! What does "langaji" mean? You mean "language?" "Kotoba!" (language) What is it? I've been stabbed in the back. Shit! How could he? I turn twenty in a week! He said he'd help me get a job. I was going to make us an honest living! But no matter how old I get, nobody will respect me! What do we do? We need to get money! We need a million yen! Somehow, I need to get that money. Starting from tomorrow, we all need to get money. What is it? Tell big brother about the job you heard about. The bombshells? I heard about it when I was selling today. My boss Windsor was saying something about a shipment to Osaka. He was going over the details with a driver. I didn't see his face. He seemed like a Kansai yakuza, though. Can you introduce me to your boss? Windsor seems reliable. Of course. He has to be very cautious. This feels good. Oh, this? Hey, don't kick it! Will we split this up just between us? Don't be stingy! I'm worried about Mikki and Paako, too. There's a patrol car! Big brother, there's a patrol car! -Has it been following us long? -I don't know. Shit! If we pull over, they'll inspect the back for sure! Big brother! Do it! Stop them! Look! What is it? What is it? Get out from there! What clan are you from? None of your damn business. Just follow my instructions! What clan is it? The Yodowara Family. Now get out! You're ferrying goods for the Naniwa Clan across our territory. We don't care about your feud. Do you want to buy these from us? For two-million yen? Just get out now! Don't do anything stupid. You bastards! If you want to shoot, go ahead. I'll blow up the whole shipment! I'll shoot! Get out of here, quick! Wait! We've lost Brat! Don't be stupid! -There's a million yen! -Good! Pleasure doing business with you. What day is it today? September 5th. Just in time. Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll finally turn 20. I'll go to the country to find success. Congratulations. It's nice, isn't it? Thank you! I'm relieved. It's going to be more difficult from here. What will we all do in the country? Are you feeling all right, Yoko? I wasn't sure if you were upset by what happened today. Getting our hands dirty like that. Up until now we've managed to avoid that You aren't thinking you want to split up? Thanks. It seems like adulthood won't be what we expected. Sabu! Divide this up! See you. Big brother! Didn't we take a million yen this time? Why aren't we splitting it up like we always do? The rule is we split it up evenly! Shut up! Are you betraying us, big brother? Don't throw around accusations like that, Sabu. You kids don't understand anything! I understand perfectly! You betrayed us, and now you're taking our share! Did you think you could use us to make new friends and get an adult job? Is that why you told about us to the newspaper? That bastard double-crossed me! He was just preying on us. But you knew, it, didn't you? It was you, wasn't it? Big sister, Grasshopper, and Brat say they didn't talk. The one who talked was you! Aren't you grateful for what I've done? Big brother! It wasn't just you looking after us! We all worked together! Big brother! You want this money? Let's race for it! I'm going back to the countryside tomorrow. On an autobike. If you're up for it, I'll race you. Big sister! Did you hear? Are you going with big brother? No. It'll be the same as always. Just let him go. We don't need him. It's better if we don't get our hands so dirty. Will you buy a wedding dress? Here's the money! No, I'll never buy one! What will we do? Split up, I guess. You mean we won't go to the villa anymore? So it seems. Can we go with Big Brother Ken? Probably not. Then what will we do? I don't know. I guess we need Big Brother Ken if we want to stick together. Should we ask for his help again? Absolutely not! I'll beat him at his own game. I'll beat him at the autobike race. For revenge? So I can say I beat him! Get it? Then you'll bring the money back here? Everyone will get an even share. Even big brother. This time, it's for real! Big sister! What do you think? Try it and see, if that's what you want. I'll do it! Look! That's big brother's village! Shit! Why haven't we seen him yet? There he is! Brat! Serves you right! Death in Autobike Duel -You sold these? -Those are returned. That's never good. You let too many people return them. "Death in Autobike Duel" It's always the same stories. The public is bored of them. Pre-teens involved, it says. So long. Ken could be frightening. But he's the one who gave each of us our hope of independence. But I wonder... With everything we had to do for money, if it really is independence. I don't know. Mr. Konjii! The End
