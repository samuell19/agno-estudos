Do I have to lock you in your room? I just went out for a walk. At 2:00 in the morning you went out for a walk? When you're grounded? I've been locked up all day. You haven't been locked up all day. But you will be. I'll nail the damn door shut if I have to. Put that down, Deena. Put that down right now! What is wrong with you? Drop it! Are you crazy? Please, don't. No, Deena! Stay back! Get out, or I'll kill you! What are you doing? Let go. Don't. Don't, Deena, no. My mom, she's bleeding. Deena, let go. Let go. Don't. Get out of my way! Stop it! You won't get away with this. No! You aren't going anywhere. Drop it. Don't touch me. Adam, your dinner's on the table. Mom, I can't play if you watch me. I'm sorry, honey. Your dinner's ready. ♪ The only thing that I want the most ♪ ♪ Is to have you here next to me ♪ Deena? Deena. I've called her three times already. I wish I could stop writing software and do this full time. Look how beautiful that is. I mean, see the way the sap wood stands on the edge? And the way the grain just kind of flows around? It's nice. Yeah. But I wish you wouldn't do this while trying to fix dinner. Huh? Oh. I gotta get these done by the weekend. I'm going to that art fair in Wenatchee. For how long? Just overnight. Saturday, Sunday. ♪ There isn't much that you have to do ♪ ♪ Except show me what I want to see ♪ ♪ And that's how much you're in love with me ♪ What is it? Room service. What are you doing? I'm going out. But you just got home. I've been home for an hour. Aren't you gonna eat dinner? I'm not hungry. What about this room? You said you'd clean it last week. I'll do it tomorrow. Aunt Judith is coming tomorrow. I'll do it right after swim practice. I promised I’d stay out of your room if you kept it clean. I'll do it tomorrow. I gotta go. You forgot to turn off your music. ♪ They ask the question what's so special... ♪ ♪ Nobody's coming around ♪ I know I won't be found ♪ Here beneath the river ♪ Life rushes... Let's go. Shut up! Your mom? No. One of her boyfriends. You guys help me out here.1, 2, 3, 4. She's going out every night. Room's a mess. Doesn't do the dishes. She's never done the dishes. She's supposed to. Well then, why do you keep doing them for her? Because if I didn't do them, they wouldn't get done. Look what happened when I stopped cleaning her room. She doesn't want you to clean her room. She's 15 years old. Before she met Garret, I could go in there whenever I wanted. Now, she's being like a complete stranger to me. Hey, Mom, can you drive me? I'm late. Okay. Be right there. Hey, ask him if he wants to go to Wenatchee with me. Dad's going to Wenatchee this weekend. Maybe on Saturday we can go out to dinner and take in a movie. Yeah, maybe. Can't ask Deena. She'd bite my head off. I don't know what this kid's done to her, but I sure don't like it. Maybe on Saturday I'll follow her and find out what he looks like. Uh, well, I know what he looks like. I seen him at school. What grade's he in? Senior. That makes him what, 17? I guess so. What's he like? He's in the Honors Society. Really? Think so. Why doesn't he ever come to the door? Mom, this is the '90s. Guys don't do that anymore. Want to watch this with me? I'll come up later. Adam should be home any minute. How was your evening? Fine. Where'd you go? We just got something to eat. Well, Adam was supposed to be watching this with me. You want to watch the rest? No, thanks. It's almost over. I'm tired, Mom. Come on, Adam, I need this. Forget it. Why? I'm doing enough for you. Sitting with Mom till she falls asleep, lying about Garret, going to Grandma's. She asked about him? She wanted to follow you around to see what he looks like. What'd you tell her? Exactly what you told me. But I can't keep doing that. And you can't keep skipping school or you're gonna ruin everything. Keep your grades up and they'll leave us alone. Isn't that what you told me? What's gonna ruin everything is if I don't get this note. I've missed two days in a row. All right, I'll make you a deal. You go to the movies with Mom on Saturday, and I'll write the note. I can't. I'm going out with Garret. This is the last time I'll ask, though, I promise. Two days? Make it three. I can't go tomorrow, either. Okay. Here. Got that? Would you close the door, honey? Grab that. Thanks. And congratulations to our winners, the Kramers... Hi, Mom. Hi, Grandma. There's a button missing on my sweater. It's in with the laundry. I'll find it. Use some cleanser on the sink this time. I got coffee stains in it. Why don't I see your sister anymore? Well, she's awfully busy. Homework, swim team, tryouts for the school play. She's also got a boyfriend. So it's goodbye, Grandma, huh? Goodbye, Mom. I hardly see her anymore. That's what happened to Judith. 14 years old. Remember that? Ran off for six months. I still say she got an abortion. I can't get Deena to stay in the house these days. I can't even get her to clean her room. Of course not. You pamper your kids half to death. Get in there and clean up your room! And if that won't work, a well-placed open hand does wonders. I have to go home now. What for? 'Cause my aunt's coming over. She was out of town for my birthday. So she's bringing me a present. It's not even 5:00. Yeah. But you don't want me to stay anyway. I don't? No. I don't? No. You sure? Yeah. 'Cause I'll start tickling you. You will? Uh-huh. No way. Get in here and clean your room. You aren't stepping one foot outside of this house until this room is... clean. Hi, Adam. You're not supposed to come in here. If you keep it clean. I said I'd clean it today. Honey, it's almost 6:00.I don't care. This is my room. These are my things. You fold those back up right now. What are you doing? No. I don't want my room clean. Stop it, Deena. Let go. Get out of my room! Why can't I keep it the way I want it? What is wrong with you? This is my room. Don't you understand that? Deena... Deena! Come back here! Very funny. Very stupid, if you ask me. Deena! Maybe I should go back. What for? Well, my aunt's coming over, and she's a really nice person. And she's bringing me a gift. Ah.But, you know, I also don't want to leave my brother there alone. And what about me? Huh? You want to leave me alone out here on these cold streets? With babes on every corner waiting to jump out and attack me? Tell you what. We're gonna flip a coin. Heads you go back, tails you don't. Okay. Well? Suppose I said I could take you to a place where all your problems would disappear? It was heads, right? A place I've never taken anyone before. Was it heads? It's a magical place. And spooky. And the only way to get there is to crawl over the bones of a dead dragon. I warned her if she didn't clean her room I was going to do it for her. She doesn’t want you in there. Then she should have done it herself. But now she can't, because it's already done. Why don't you ground her? Take away her television. Take away her stereo. If you think it's that easy, why don't you do it? Because you never let me. Well, she's got so much going on these days, she probably just forgot you were coming over. No, it's weird. I just talked to her yesterday. Well, maybe her swimming practice ran late. Well, I'm not going to worry about it. Remember how Mom used to worry about you whenever you were late? She never worried about me. Oh, she still worries about you. I was just over there today and she was talking about that time that you... I don't want to talk about her. I told you that. Well, maybe if you had your own children, you'd understand how she feels, never seeing you anymore. I've spent a fortune on therapists learning how not to care how she feels. Let's see who can go the longest without talking. Great idea. You lost. You lost. Let's go into the living room. Adam, you can play something for us on the piano. Now? That new piece you've been learning. I don't know it that well. Come on. We'll be a very forgiving audience. Hey, you don't have to if you don't want to. Maybe just one for your mother, huh? Where are you going? To get my music. Hey, that was great. Thank you. One more, one more, I'm on a roll. Go on, honey, go ahead. Come on, we're almost there. Keep coming. Come on, don't stop. Don't look down. Come on, give me your hand. No, I can do it. Come on. What if it starts snowing? That's not a problem. It's the wind you gotta worry about. This thing shakes so bad, it'll make you seasick. Come on, right here. Last climb. Come on. Oh. How did you find this place? I was looking for a really weird place to kill myself. Are you serious? I'm always serious. Whoo! So what happened? I thought of something better. Me? No. This happened last summer, before I met you. Who knows? Still might do it. Not tonight, I hope. No. Not tonight. Tonight, I have better things to do. Hey. Where you been? Just out. Your mom wants to see you. She's upstairs. Is she still mad? She just needs some reassurance that everything's okay. So just go up and talk to her, okay? And, uh, how about letting her clean your room? It'd mean a lot to her. Okay? Would you go up and talk to her? Believe me, I'm sure now. Can you understand that? I understand. You wanted to talk to me. This movie's so sad. Come on over. Where were you tonight? Out. With Garret? Mm-hmm. When are we gonna meet him? I don't know. Must be quite a guy. Yeah, he's okay. Well, maybe he could come over on Saturday and we could all go to a movie together. Is he a good kisser? Oh, come on, Deena. I told you about the first time a boy kissed me, remember? I couldn't figure out why he wanted me to open my mouth. Oh, come on. Why don't you watch the rest of this movie with me? I'm really tired, Mom. Oh, come on. I hate to cry alone. Besides, it's almost over. Still friends? Yeah. Sorry I cleaned your room. Where were you last Friday? What do you mean? And last Wednesday. I was in school. Not according to this. This is crazy. I was in school. I called Mr. Pilney. He says he has three letters there with my signature on them saying that you were home sick. I was in school, Mom. We're gonna call him right now. Why? I'm gonna see him tomorrow. I want to find out right now... Why are you shouting at me? I am not shouting. You are. You are shouting at me. until I find out what’s going on. Now, don't walkaway when I'm... Don't do that! I'm talking to you. Let go of me! Deena, come back here! Deena! Deena! Deena! What's she gonna do? She'll probably knock off a bottle of wine and then say she's sorry. Sorry for what? You hit her. She'll think of something. I mean, it's crazy. I mean, we both say "I love you," and it's over. So then, what are you worried about? The letter from school. We could burn the school down, destroy the evidence. You know I hate to say this. What? This is gonna sound awful. What? I mean, I love my mom, but... I think I do, anyway, but it felt good. What did? Hitting her. I can't believe I just said that. Hey, come on. Don't worry about it. She asked for it. Didn't she? I don't want anything physical going on in this house. I shouldn't have grabbed her. I think it’s the other way around. She didn't do this on purpose. If I hadn't tried to grab... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why should you have to grab her? Is that the only way you can keep her from going out? It's this kid Garret. Ever since she met him, the rules have gone right out the window. She never had any rules. That's the problem. Of course she had rules. Well, you never enforced them. I'm sure you didn't do this on purpose. But when I bump into someone on the street, the least I can do is say I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry I grabbed you. Did you show him the letter? No. I did skip school. Why? I don't know. Where did you go? Up on the avenue. With Garret? No. I was alone. Oh, Deena. Deena, Deena, Deena, talk to me. What's going on? I don't know. I'll never do it again, I promise. I believe you, sweetheart. I'm just so glad you're telling me the truth. I need your help, Mom. Anything. Will you say you wrote those letters? I can't do that. I'll never do it again, I promise. I was so confused when I called you. I had my dates all mixed up. We had a terrible flu come through the house. So you did write those letters. Yes. Well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't have sent a note home. It's just that last month, when Deena missed so many swimming practices she got kicked off the team, I just... I began to worry... That's when this flu thing started. It came on really slow, and I just didn't have any energy. The doctor thinks that it might have even been mono. Until recently, you've never done anything to call attention to yourself. As a matter of fact, you work hard not to call attention to yourself. That doesn't always mean there's a problem. It just means that sometimes that person might have something to hide. How could you let me go in there without knowing about the swim team? What else don't I know? Nothing. And how could you lie like that? Not just to him, but to me. Let go of me. I have a class. Are you pregnant? What? You can tell me... God, Mom, no. Let go of me. What in God's name were you thinking? I had no idea she'd been kicked off the swim team. She's skipping school, and you lied about it right in front of her? I was trying to help her. Your idea of helping is letting her get away with murder. It's this kid Garret. The problem isn't Garret. She was getting straight A's. The problem is that you’re afraid to say no. She was on the swim team. No means yes around here. That isn't true. And if she doesn't do what you tell her, you twist it around until it's your fault. Either that, or you pour another glass of wine and forget about it. And what do you do? Starting tonight, I'm gonna do what you should have done a long time ago. Now, you know this isn't gonna be any worse an hour from now. Right? So we could, um, well, we could go up to the avenue. I have to go in. And so do I. Something we can dream about. Hmm. Bye. Bye. Deena. Come in here and sit down. Adam, come downstairs. I have to go to the bathroom first. Now you've got us both in trouble. How did I get you in trouble? He's making lists. Stuff we're supposed to do. How could you be so stupid? I wasn't stupid. Skipping school was stupid. Hitting Mom was stupid. I didn't do that on purpose. I was standing right here. I saw you. You better get your eyes checked 'cause it was an accident. You better do something about your breath before you go downstairs. Garret. Garret. You're gonna get me in trouble. I told you I was coming in. Come here. Shh. Get down, get down, get down. I want you to come downstairs. Right now. Okay. I'm going to make a few changes around here. Do you mind sitting down? What for?'Cause we're talking. I can talk standing up. I want you to sit down. Look, I don't care if she lies on the floor as long as she can hear me. Where have you been going every day? I told Mom. Up on the avenue. Doing what? Never mind. I don't know if you'd be telling me the truth or not. The bottom line is I want you to come right home after school every day. And I want you to do everything it says on this list. Clean your room, throw out the garbage, homework, everything. Fine. Read it. Fine. You miss one of those things, you lose your stereo. A second, you lose your TV. A third, your telephone. And it keeps going like that until this gets straightened out. Any questions? No. That's it, then. Shh. I called the school today. She made all her classes. That's a good sign. She's way behind, but I got a list of the missing assignments. I also found out a few things about Garret. Good. You can talk to her about it when she gets home. She's not home? What did you expect? Did she call? Not a word. But I can guarantee you one thing. I know who she's with. You're always saying "Don't upset Mom." I thought if I told her the truth, she'd be upset. Did I tell you to lie? No. Garret's on suspension for hitting a teacher. Your mom should have known that. Are you lying to me now? No. And you're absolutely sure you don't know where Deena is? I want the truth, Adam. ♪ I'm the one alone at night ♪ I'm trying to find a number for her friend Garret. I thought maybe you’d have it. Yeah, right. Well, thanks anyway. Well, who else can I call? Um, try her friend... Oh, what's her name? Oh, oh, Donna somebody. Donna. Yeah, Donna. Um... Hello? Hi, Dad, it's me. Where are you? I'm at a coffee shop with Elaine. I told you to come straight home after school. No, you didn't. I did, too. I was very specific about that. Oh. I thought you wanted me to do my homework right after school. That's what it says on the list, and that's what I did. I didn't think that I had to do it at home. Uh-huh. So I went over to Elaine's house after school 'cause I needed help catching up on my math. Is that where you are now? At Elaine's? Um, no. We're at a coffee shop. I came out to get something to eat. Well, did you get your work finished? We're still working on it. Look, I'm really sorry, Dad. I thought I was doing what you wanted. When can you be home? What time? 11. How about 10:30? That's fine. I'll see you at 10:30. I love you. I love you, too. She's at a coffee shop with Elaine. Hi. This is Cynthia Marten. I'm fine. Listen, is Elaine there, by any chance? ♪ Turn out the sun ♪ Yeah ♪ Sun ♪ Yeah ♪ Go get your gun ♪ Treat her like foam ♪ Kingdom and come ♪ Shoot out the light ♪ Shoot out the light ♪ Shoot out the light ♪ Yeah Hi. Come on. I gotta get home early so I can start building up some Brownie points. Okay. See you. Bye, you guys. All right, have a good one. I'm not calling you a liar. We just want to see the work. I'll show you tomorrow. I'm tired right now. I don't care what it looks like. I'm not gonna ask you to do it over. Then what's the point? We want to see that you did the work. So you don't trust me. Do you deserve to be trusted? Why don't you just say it? You don't trust me. We don't trust you. Just show us the homework, and then you can go to bed. Why are you yelling at me? I am not. Yes, you are. You're always yelling at me. If you didn't do it, just say so. Look, let me just look at the... Don't! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Stop that! Oh! Adam! Get down here! Get down here now! Just get the ice. Oh, my God. All right... We're going to the hospital. Get the keys. Get the car started. Just get the car started. Adam! I didn't mean to. I'm coming! I didn't mean it. The hospital? Hurry up. Get your coat. Deena, wait for me! Slow down. You're gonna fall. Be careful. Slow down. This is crazy. You're gonna kill yourself. These boards are loose. It's not safe. Watch out! Would you wait for me? What are you doing? Deena, wait. Slow down. What's going on? I can't go back there. Why? What the hell happened? It's just too intense. My parents are crazy. Or maybe it's me that's crazy. Maybe I have too many violent hormones in me or something. Don't you tell me about crazy. You know why my mom’s got mirrors hanging all over the house? She thinks my dad was the devil. It's supposed to reflect away his evil spirit. So what does that make you? The son of Satan? Maybe. You know, I actually thought about killing her. I was gonna use a baseball bat. Why didn't you? Because I came up with something better. Shotgun? No. Something even better than that. Now, listen to me. This is something I never told anybody before. Not even the band. Come here. When the weather gets nice, that's where I'm going. I'm gonna hitch down to California, I'm gonna sell a few songs. Eventually, I'm gonna make my way down to Austin. Why are you telling me this? Because I thought you might want to come with me. Are you serious? Why not? I'm ready. I'll go right now. No. We're gonna wait till the weather gets nice. You don't want to be out on the highway with an icicle hanging off your thumb. Believe me, anything's better than going home. Not anymore. Everything's gonna be different now. Different how? You've got a way out. You can survive anything if you've got a way out. The bookcase fell on your hand? Right. Well, let's see what we've got here. Must have been a heavy bookcase. Mm-hmm. See if you can open your fingers. No. No? Well, I'm going to need to get an X-ray. Why don't you wait here, and I'll get the paperwork started. I'll be right back. Why don't you have her check the bruise on your arm? I don't care about the bruise. I just want to find out if my fingers are broken. Settle down. We have to get her tested for drugs. We could do it right here in the hospital. We've got to do it fast, before this happens again. It's not gonna happen again. How you gonna stop it? Believe me, I'll stop it. Well, we can't start hitting her back, or we'll all end up in the hospital. I'll call the police. The police? What are they gonna do? They'll settle her down. She's not gonna hit a cop. She's also not gonna see this Garret. That's out, period. No homework, just a bunch of Fs and "incompletes." Look at this. 15 years old. I didn't try this stuff till I was in coll... Shh. No. What are you doing? She'll go ballistic if she finds us in here. I told you, I'm gonna call the police. You can't do that. We'll have half the neighborhood standing on our front... How am I supposed to work? And how long has this been going on? It's not mine. Not anymore. Where's your homework? I didn't do it. You lied, then.Yeah. As of right now, you are grounded indefinitely. No stereo, no television, no telephone, no nothing. And you aren't going to see Garret anymore. Tomorrow you'll stay home, and you'll complete every one of your missing assignments. Tomorrow is Saturday. Good! Then you'll have the weekend to finish it. And if you ever, ever raise your hand to anyone in this family again, I'll call the police. The police? Yes. What are they gonna do? I hope you'll never have to find out. I could just tell them it was self-defense. Self-defense against what? I could say you tried to attack me. Maybe even tried to rape me.Todd. Who do you think they'd believe? I can't believe she'd say that to the police. I don't know what she'd do anymore. I'm afraid to go to sleep in my own house. Whatever drug she's on, it's a lot stronger than anything in this bag. Adam. Adam. What are you... Shh. You're supposed to knock. I need you to take this to Garret. Why can't you?'Cause I'm grounded. I can't even use the phone. Why am I not surprised? Adam. I need your help. I need you to stop acting crazy. You know what's gonna happen next time? There isn't gonna be a next time. I'm leaving. You're what? I'm going to California with Garret. You can't do that. Why not? Mom hates me, and Dad never even wanted me in the first place. He never wanted me, either. But I'm stuck here. Just take the letter. Please. Give me one good reason why I should. One good reason. She said you'd give me a joint. What is it? How's it going? Fine. I thought maybe you'd like a snack. No, thanks. Need any help? No. You sure? I'm fine. Would you like to come down and watch a movie with me later? No, thanks. We don't like doing this. I hope you know that. Anything special you'd like for dinner? No. Maybe I'll make that deep dish pizza you like. Fine. Would you like me to close the door? Yeah. She's been up there all day. Do you think we're being too hard on her? After she broke my finger? She didn't do it on purpose. Maybe we could give her back her stereo. At least she'd have something to listen to. When she gets caught up on her work, we'll give her back the stereo. Not before. If you want to give her back her stereo, go ahead. No, no, you're right. No. She's been doing the work. Let's give her some positive feedback. Okay. Do you want to tell her? No. You go ahead. Okay. Garret? Garret? Where were you? Got in a fight. With who? Some bastard my mom brought home. I'm gonna kill him. Swear to God, I'm gonna bust him wide open. Oh, my God, he really hurt you. It wasn't just him. It was my mom too. Your mom? Yeah. He was pushing her around, she was screaming, so I jumped in, the next thing I know, they're both kicking me. I'm gonna kill them both. Either that, or I'm getting the hell out of here tonight. Tonight? Tonight. If you get your stuff, I'll meet you outside your house in 20 minutes. 20 minutes. Do I have to lock you in your room? I just went out for a walk. At 2:00 in the morning you went out for a walk? When you're grounded? I've been locked up all day. You haven't been locked up all day, but you will be. I'll nail the damn door shut if I have to. You're not leaving this house until we get you to a doctor. A doctor? It's for your own good, Deena. Whatever's going on, it has to stop. What are you doing? And it's gonna stop now. We're trying to help you. Get away from me. Put that down. Deena, put that down right now. Get away! Deena! Put the damn phone down! Get away from me! Deena, stop it! What the hell are you doing? Put that down right... Deena! Deena, come back here! Deena! You're not leaving. He's out there. He's waiting for you. I know he is. And you're not gonna meet him. You stay... Don't do this. She's got a knife! My mom's bleeding. Get out of my way! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let me go! Stay back. Stay back, Adam. Don't come in my room or I'll kill you. Are you okay? Adam, stay down here. Get the street cordoned off for EMS. I don't know what we're gonna do. We've tried everything. She's out of control. She breaks things. She hits her mother. What happened to your hand? Uh, that was an accident. Look, if you could just get that knife away from her, calm her down, I'm sure we could... We're taking you to the hospital. No, you're not. She's under arrest. Arrest for what? Assault. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, we don't want this. You can't arrest her. Take her out. You can't do that. Wait a minute, we didn’t ask for this. We didn’t call the police. I did. It was your idea. At the hospital, you said... I didn't say you should call the police. Here, you can see her in the morning. This'll tell you what to do. Come on. Outside. Deena. Deena, Deena, don't worry, we'll be there... What happened? What's going on? It's a complete misunderstanding. It's got... Somebody called the cops. It's crazy. Look, Deena, Deena, it's only gonna be a few hours. They said we can come down first thing in the morning. We'll get you right home, sweetheart. All the way in. Give me your things and strip down. Come on, let's go. What are you doing? I'm going down there right now. We can go down first thing in the morning, 7:00. She's not spending the night in jail. Maybe it'll teach her a lesson. You know what kind of lesson it'll teach her. You know what kind of kids they have in jail? Yeah, kids like Garret. That's the first person she'll run to if we bring her home. Then what are we supposed to do? We'll pick her up first thing in the morning and take her to the hospital. Get her tested for drugs. Taking any medications? No. Drugs? No. Feeling depressed? No.Anxious? No.Anything bothering you? I just want to call my parents. This is the operator. How are you billing your call? Collect. Name, please. Deena Marten. Yeah. It's me. Where are you? I'm in jail. What happened? My parents tried to stop me, and we got in a really big fight and I grabbed a knife. A knife? I wasn't gonna use it. I just wanted to get out of the house. All right. What's gonna happen now? I don't know. But I'm scared. I... I'm going to court tomorrow, but... Hey, don't worry about it. I'll bust you out of there myself if I have to. I don't think so. Well then, you remember this, okay? And after I say it, don't talk to anyone else. Just go to sleep with this in your head. I love you. I love you, too. You're not in a position to withdraw the charges. But we're her parents. She assaulted you with a weapon. She had a knife, but she wasn't going to use it. I'm talking about the telephone. The knife enters into it, but... Look, we know she has problems. And we're going to get her whatever help she needs. We think she's on drugs, maybe cocaine. There were no drugs found in her system. But whether there were or not, what I see here is a pattern of physical abuse. That's a crime. Physical abuse? That's ridiculous. We're her parents. We're seeing more of this every day. Can't believe this. We used to see it primarily in immigrant families, where the parents don't know the language and the children have all the power. That's not us. I'm just saying that this seems to happen when those roles get reversed. When the children become the survival figures for their parents. We're good parents. We have a good family. And we want Deena to come home. And I'm asking you to help me hold her accountable for what she did. I know that's hard. This is the only place in our entire justice system where the victim is asked to help prosecute someone they want to defend. Okay, you'll plead not guilty. That's automatic. That's gonna give us time to prepare the case. How long will that take? About four to six weeks. I have to stay here for four to six weeks? Well, that's what the judge is gonna rule on this afternoon. I'm no busboy. You pick it up! You pick up the tray now. I can't stay here. I'm not like these other kids. I just want to go home. Well, I don't think the judge is gonna let you do that, Deena. Why? I didn't do anything. Deena, look. I want you to be very clear about something. You attacked your parents with a weapon. Okay? This system is set up to protect the victim. Not the aggressor. You're being charged with Assault Two. That's a felony. It's a very serious charge. Since this is your first offense, I don’t want to keep you in detention. But the situation at your home is far too volatile for me to send you back until the case is resolved. Uh, Your Honor, if I could say something. I don't think Deena was trying to hit her mother with the telephone. I think she was just trying... I don't want to hear about that now. I'm only interested in whether I should keep Deena in detention until the dispo hearing. Are there any alternative placements available? Your Honor, I spoke with Deena this morning, and she informed me that if she can't go home, she has an aunt she’d like to stay with. But she wants to come home. I can't allow that. Look, let's just get her out, then we'll worry about the rest later, okay? Do you have any objection to the aunt? Assuming that the probation officer approves. No. No, Your Honor. In addition to the placement order, I want Deena to abide by whatever guidelines her probation officer sets forth, and to begin counseling immediately. If it were in my power, I'd order the entire family into therapy. But I can't do that. What I can do is mandate that between now and the dispo hearing, you see your daughter only in the presence of a therapist approved by this court. I got in terrible fights with my mom, too. Yeah, but I bet you never hit her. No. She did all the hitting. My mom never hit me. She never even spanked me. I think that she just swung way over in the other direction trying not to do what our mom did. Yeah, but why'd I hit her? I mean, why'd I grab that knife? Where does that come from? I don't know. Sounds like everything got turned upside-down. What was it like growing up with her? We were really different. I remember her favorite book was Lives of the Saints. Hello. Yeah, hold on. It's your mom. I'm gonna go get your bedding ready. Okay. Hi. Hi. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I've been thinking about you all day. I was remembering when you were little, and I got out some of your old baby pictures. I kept asking myself what happened. We were so close. We were best friends. What'd I do wrong? I mean, I know I haven't been a perfect mother, but I have tried harder than any mother I know. I love you, sweetheart. You don't have to say anything. I love you, too. No, no, no. I don't want you to say something you don't mean. I do mean it. Then talk to me, Deena. You're the only one I have to talk to. I'm sorry I called. Hello. Hi. Can I talk to Deena again, please? Yeah, just a moment. She can't talk now. I... Look, I just want to say good night, okay? She can't talk. Put her on the phone right now. Oh, I don't know what she said, but... She's drunk.Yeah. Why does it have to be me? Why can't it be somebody else? I don't have any choice. If I leave, they'll come after me and they're gonna throw me right back into lock-up. That's cool. We could be outlaws. Bonnie and Clyde? Six weeks, huh? Yeah. But remember what you told me? You told me you could survive anything if you had a way out. She's not here. She's gone. There's nothing we can do about that. I'm still her mother. And I'm still her father. But I can't... What are you doing? She needs clothes. You can't take them. I'm not gonna let anyone tell me when I can see my own daughter. I am not going to see her with a therapist. Why? Because it'll make everything worse. How? Because she'll turn everything around. She'll say that I drink too much. She'll say that you raped her. Then suddenly she’ll be the victim and we'll be the misguided parents who... That is exactly what the attorney said! She has all the power. It's getting worse. They're fighting all the time. You shouldn't have called the cops. You shouldn't have pulled the knife. I wasn't gonna use it, Adam. How was I supposed to know that? It doesn't matter. It does matter. Everything's a mess. Mom's drinking every day. Dad's yelling at her. There's nothing I can do about it. You can take me with you. What? To California. I can't take you to California. Why not? Because you're too young. Besides, everything will be better once I'm gone. No, it won't. If you don't take me, I'm going on my own. I don't care what the court says. She's your child. And if you know what's good for her, you'll get her away from Judith. I don't have any choice. Well, let her come here. I'll straighten her out in a hurry. No. I have my own way. Your way is pathetic. Look what you've done to her. And look what you've done to me. And to Judith. No wonder we're so messed up, Mom, the way you've treat... Ah. Hi. Deena around? Yeah, she's in her room. I made pizza for dinner, and I made one for her. May I come in, please? Let me... Why don't you sit down? No, no, that's okay. That's okay. Deena. Honey. Honey? Honey, look, I made you your favorite pizza. See? You're not supposed to be here. What? You're not supposed to be... No no no no. I heard the words. But I made your favorite thing in the whole wide world, and I drove all the way over here while it was still hot. Can't you even say thank you? Don't you appreciate anything I do for you? Oh, God.Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry about it, I'll get it. Let me... No no no no. No! Don't. I'm leaving. Deena doesn't want me here. God knows she doesn't want to come home. Do you? I could drive you home. Do you know who you remind me of? My sister. You two are just alike, you know that? You never could say thank you, either. You never thanked me for taking care of Mom so you could play with your friends. I didn't have any friends... because of you. And you never cleaned up after Mother. You still don't. Because you're selfish! Oh, man. Deena. Deena! Deena! ♪ Careful where you're going ♪ ♪ Careful who you are ♪ Trouble gonna find you ♪ Check back over your shoulder ♪ ♪ Don't you ever rest ♪ Before you see who's on the corner ♪ ♪ Maybe that's the moment ♪ Where you feel ashamed ♪ Who's that at the window? ♪ Do you recognize the face? ♪ Garret? Deena! Who's Deena? Deena, wait! Wait! Garret, please stop! Don't leave me. Please don't leave me up here. Deena, wait! Just slow down. Garret! Slow down, damn it! Wait for me! Deena, wait for me. Deena! She said something about going to see a movie with you. No? Okay. Well, look, if she should stop by, would you ask her to call home? Thank you. Hi. She's back. Why didn't you call us? Because I want to talk to you in person. I don't need a lecture. Do you remember that time when Mom went out to get dinner and came back so drunk that she threw up all over the food? I remember you ran out of the house and you left me to clean up the mess. Do you remember what that night felt like? 'Cause that’s how Deena felt tonight. Don't compare me with Mother. I am nothing like her. You were tonight. You even sounded like her. If I am such a terrible mother, why do I have wonderful kids? Deena was a terrific kid until she met Garret. Adam is still a terrific kid. I am not saying you're a terrible mother. No, no, don't take it back. Don't take it back. No no no. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm just fooling myself. Why don't we ask Adam? Adam! He's in bed. He won't be sleeping. Um, she's been under a lot of pressure. Todd, she's an alcoholic. Adam. Hmm? Honey, would you mind coming downstairs? What for? Turn it off. I'm sleeping. She doesn't know about last summer or about... Um, you're right. He's asleep. Listen, we're all tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow? Go back to bed. Go back to bed. Adam, go back upstairs, honey. Go... Okay. Here, let me help you. Here, let me help you. Let me help you. Let go of me! Watch the glass. This has never happened before. Tell her. Tell her. Adam, come here, son. He's asleep. He was like this once last summer and again at Christmas. You didn't tell me? No. How could you not tell me? I knew it would upset you and when you're upset, you drink. Things were bad enough last Christmas. Maybe that's because you were off selling your bowls and I was left to do all the work. Yeah, well, maybe you drank because I wasn't around, and maybe I wasn't around because you drank. All started so long ago, I don't remember. It started when we had Deena. That's when you bought all this equipment. That's when I stopped having a wife. Oh, you've got such a distorted view of things. I remember when she was a little girl. She was the center of everything. She ran this house. And every time she got angry with you and... She could be a vicious little girl. You just rolled over and took it. It was always your fault. Nothing she ever did was wrong. It was like you needed her to be your friend more than you needed to be her mother. Maybe I needed her because she was all I had. Maybe you came down here in this basement and worked on these bowls and you weren't there for me. I came down to this basement 'cause all you cared about was the kids. Oh, no, you got it all backwards. That is not how it happened. It doesn't matter how it happened. What matters is that I get out of this basement and start being a father. What matters is that you stop drinking and be a mother. Don't you talk to me about being a mother. Not when you've spent our entire marriage hiding in this basement working on these stupid bowls. Go ahead. Smash the rest of them. I don't care. All I care about is getting help so we can go... You're the one that needs help, not me. I'm gonna get it. Starting tomorrow. I hope you'll come with me. What are you doing here? I want to explain what happened. I have a therapy appointment. Does that mean you won't talk to me? Adam, let's go. Sure you won't change your mind? I wish you would. It's something we need to do together. I broke up with her the day I met you. She wouldn't stop calling. I mean, she's just incredibly possessive. How many other girls have you taken up there? None. None, I swear to God. Did you have sex with her? It didn't mean anything. Then why'd you do it? I wanted to make sure it was over. You had to have sex with her for that? Doesn't that sound a little warped? Look, I'm just being honest. I don't have any more old girlfriends. I love you. And that's why I waited. That's why I'm still waiting. What? It's my dad. You want to come to my house? I can't. If I miss this appointment, they're gonna throw me back into lock-up. I was hoping your mother would be here. What for? I want things to be different. Why? I love you. Both of you. And I love your mother very much. I know. Just sounds like words. But... You didn't want me in the first place. That's not true. You wanted Mom to have an abortion. I wanted to wait, that's all. The answer's still yes, isn't it? It doesn't mean I don't love you. That's why I'm here. I just want things to be better. Okay, thanks. That was a really good session. See you guys next week, okay? Okay. Hi, Deena.Hi. Hi. I'm Todd Marten, Deena's father. Hi. I'm Wendy Tremaine. I'm really glad you came. This is my son Adam. Hi, Adam. Come on in. I think we all need help. I could send you to jail for six months, Deena. But since this is your first offense and since I've had some very good reports from your therapist, I'm going to allow you to go home. But I'm also placing you on probation for one year, provided that you perform 300 hours hours of community service, that you attend anger management classes, and that you abide by whatever additional guidelines your probation officer deems appropriate. I have high hopes for you, Deena. I've seen too many kids fall by the wayside because they did not have the support of their families. You've got that. So don't let me see you back here again. Thank you. Hey.Hi. Oh. It's good news, huh? Yeah, I get to go home. When do we get to leave? I can't go. What do you mean you can't? Everything's different now. My mom's going into a treatment program. My dad needs my help. And my brother needs all the help he can get. What about me? I want you to stay too. I can't do that and you know it. You give it a try, Deena. You at least owe me that much. I'm being honest with you. I don't owe you any more than that. I've waited six weeks for you. I know. You lied to me, didn't you? No. That's another lie. No, it's not. You're coming with me. I can't. You are coming with me. Let go of me. Here, let me get that for you.Thanks. Hi.Hi, Adam. Judith.Hi. Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Dad. Welcome home.
