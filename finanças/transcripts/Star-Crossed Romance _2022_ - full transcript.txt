20 points! Our very own Denver Gold down 20 points in the first half. It was getting down to the wire. And they needed some big defensive plays. Okay, folks. Check out this replay, look at LaShawn here. Just lets the ball pass! He's moving so slow! Somebody get this guy a Zimmer frame. Thankfully, we had MVP Garreth to unleash his... - Unstoppable force. - unstoppable force. I'll tell you this, when he's gunning for that hoop, I do not want to be in his way. Although, give me a shot, maybe I could take him. He's gotta pick up the pace if the Gold are gonna get better with starts. Make dinner, check. We all know that the Gold have the components heading into this championship series. And in my opinion? Garreth is the best hope we've got. Oh, hot, hot! Unless... - You sub me in, of course. - you sub me in, of course. But I've said it before and I'll say it again: what matters most is supporting who we have at home. Mom! Diner's ready! The Denver Gold! I'm Piper Alvarez, and as always, I love keeping you... In the Hoop! Hey, sleepyhead. Mom? What are you doing? You gotta stop falling asleep on the couch. I was watching the game, and I tried to wait up for you, but... Oh, yeah? What'd you think, Ollie? How'd I do? You were great. But LaShawn needs to work on his follow through, or coach should bench him. Careful, ruthless. You're gonna take my job. Uh... Sure. Then you can go call baseball! Baseball? Clever. You finish your history homework? Um... It's a group project. And the others haven't started yet, so... So, I am your mom, I care what you do. Don't let them drag you down. Come on, up. Bed. Being independent guarantees your success. Take care of yourself and nobody can take that away from you. Yup, I got the t-shirt, okay? Well, if you listened to me, I wouldn't have to repeat myself. I wouldn't have to repeat myself. I wouldn't have to repeat myself... Mom! Stop. Goodnight, Oliver. I love you. - I love you. - Oh, brush your teeth! Or I'll put you on the bench. Catch. I think it's best that you stick to basketball. You. I have created a monster. Okay, Bex, so we've got the run-through at 11:00. And you're gonna move the meeting with the staff team to tomorrow, right? Oh, and you'll set up the interview with the mascot union? And we've got Garreth's birthday, don't forget. Don't worry! I'll take care of everything, bossy boss. Thank you, Bex. Just get Garreth a giant fruit basket and a giant card sign. "Happy Birthday, baller. From Piper." Oh, he does love dry fruit baskets. You gave Harlow the exact same thing last month. Oh. Morning, my little genius! Your Mom says you're kicking school's butt! Yeah. Bex, while you're out, do you mind grabbing... I'll get you more coffee. Black, like my soul. Of course. You're too good to me. Bye honey, I love you! Wait, wait, Mom, uh... Can I ask you something? Uhoh. Do I need a lawyer? No! Just um... If you want, in a couple of weeks... The finals, yes, I know. If you wanna come, you have to have no assignments, and straight As. No, no, no, that's not what this is about. Sorry, honey, I gotta... One second. Bex, what's up? Uh, Honey, I gotta go. I love you! Have a great day, bye! Uh-oh. Is mommy too famous to listen to you? Must be hard when your mom's a celebrity. Hi, Anya. Bye, Anya. Aww. Dost thou not laugh? No, for I'd rather weep. Hey! I wasn't done making fun of you! We're on in three minutes! We'll be there! And good to go! Uh, no! Piper, get to the good bits! Point guard Ryan Ricks got divorced. I should just have to talk about the game. Well, heartbreak shakes up every aspect of someone's life! But... I could turn it around for him. No, no, no. Do not date a player, they're all players. But again, so is every single man on planet Earth! You don't get a say, you won't date anyone. I'm gonna keep searching for my Prince Charming. Don't kiss any toads! Never works. Ah, Piper! "T'is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all!" You know who loves that quote? Divorce lawyers. Hey, finding love can be scary, but it's definitely worth the risk. I mean, think about Ricks. He fits my Prince Charming mold: tall, handsome-ish. And he's got a huge... 401K. Oh, my gosh! That 401k was funny, girl. I know! Here comes your other Prince. Christopher! - Oh! How do I look? - Unhinged, as always. Look out! There he is! Uhoh! Here I am! There's a wild CEO on the loose, am I right? Well, you pay me enough to say, "You're always right". You're so funny, Piper! Okay, I've got some updates I need you to weave in: Connor's gonna be a father, a baby girl; and Garreth, he's getting engaged again. Come on, Chris. People don't watch my show for gossip. They tune in for game recaps, updates... And for you! 'Cause you're so amazing! And because you're so good, you're gonna be able to slip in those lifestyle updates, no dramas, right? - But, I'm thinking... - You're killing' it! Keep this up, crush the finals, and maybe a certain someone will have some exciting offers on the table. Her own national sports panel show, a hall of fame? Who knows? My own national panel? A hall of fame?! You're killing' it, too! Like a C-E-Oh, my gosh, you're so good! Rein it in, Bex. Ah, thank you... Flexi. - It's Bex! - One minute! Clear the stage! - Alright, I'm good. Thanks. - Okay. Hello? One sec. It's Oliver's school. Some sort of emergency? I don't know. Hello, is Oliver okay? The Principal's office? Why? He got in a fight?! We're live in five, four... With a girl?! - Piper, you're on! - What the hell... Hello there, Denver! We've got some wild updates for you. Hope you're sitting down. Excuse me?! Piper Alvarez. My son... Yeah. You can wait in the hall, I'm not quite ready. No, I got a call. I've got a call as well, see? I'm on the phone, I will talk to you when I'm done being on the phone. Wait in the hall, thank you. Wow! Oh! Careful. Don't fall. Yes. Great. Thank you. Um... - Erik - Erik. Yes. Thank you. Oh! I'm Piper. You can stop thanking me. Yes. Yup, I can. Thank you? Right. Sorry about Joan. She can get a bit little... Unbelievably rude? But pretty good at being direct. Exactly what I was gonna say. So what, are you in for, "caught chewing gum again"? Uh... Not exactly. Mr. Rosen. Ms. Alvarez. Come on in, please. Come on in! Quickly! - Oh, just... - Don't run. Quickly! Your children have been in my office all morning. What's happening? Where's Oliver? Where is Anya? Anya and Oliver were in a physical altercation this morning. What?! Mmhmm. They are being checked out by the nurse. Because they were pushing and shoving and eye-poking. No blood, nothing broken. Just a little bruise. Minor as this was, a fight is very, very serious. The issue right now is that neither student is admitting fault. Well, it isn't Anya. I've instilled good family values. Safety, respect, honesty. Way to go, Father of the Year. Look, Oliver is a straight-A student. Plus, he's not about to hit a girl! Ms. Alvarez, this is the first time that I've... seen you at the school? And? And I'm not sure where I was going with that. Mr. Rosen, I see you here every single day. Mh-mm. That's because I take an interest in my child's education and make sure that they're safe all the time. Oh, please. Be that as it may, I will not tolerate violence in my school. My policy is very, very clear. I have no choice: Anya and Oliver will both be suspended. Unless... Come on, Joany! Okay. First of all, my name is Joan. And secondly, in this office, it really does need to be Principal Hosen. Principal Hosen... Unless what? Well, this is the first time either student has been in trouble. And I am aware that being single parents is no easy task. But you two, you both need to have some healthier involvement in your children's schooling. Great, what's that mean? A donation? A donation? No, not a donation. Anya and Oliver share one mutual extra-curricular. And I want you two to see to its success. The two of you are going to work together to help produce Romeo and Juliet. Wait? What? No, Oliver's an academic, he's captain of the basketball team. He's not in a play... Oh, oh. That's very surprising. Not in a play? Boo! Surprise! He was cast as Romeo last month. Something you should know. Yes, Mr. Rosen? Okay, you said, "work together"? - I did indeed. - I'm on the PTA. - I'm aware. - I'm a room parent. - Yes, you are. - I'm even in the cafeteria! Everyday while I'm having my lunch. I can take care of Anya, and do this whole show by myself. Yeah, actually, that's a great idea. I'm all for that. Go Erik! No, no! Hey, come on. I'm running the show here. Absolutely not. You will work together on this, and this alone, which means no PTA for Mr. Erik. Or both children are suspended. End of discussion. I've hit the pear, end of discussion. - Fine. - Fine. Fine. Good. Fantastic news. Pardonnez-moi! I'd like to say a little something, given that I am the creative visionary here! This is Mr. Lane, our dramatics teacher. I don't want my show trifled with by amateurs. But a certain someone... said that if I don't agree, I'm gonna lose my parking spot for my Vespa. So, you will work to my specifications. That's a little much, Leslie. Detailed sketches of the sets, props, and costumes for my steampunk, hip-hop, reimagining: Romeo and Juliet, 3000! It will be perfect for opening night, you only ever get one. Unless we take the show on the road? No, no. My humble request denied. Good luck. You're gonna need it. This is gonna be fun. No, did you not just see him? This is not going to be fun at all. It is a punishment. Also, I'm a big, big fan. I have been since the beginning of your career. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, you may go. Go! We're done. I said I was sorry. Oliver Alvarez. I just don't understand. You never mentioned any tension with this Anya girl. It doesn't matter! There's no tension. Oh, right. I forgot. You always get into fights with completely random people. Let alone some little girl! She's not that little. Oliver Paul. Hey. Don't box me out. If something's wrong, talk to me. Mom, Principal Hosen already gave us a stern talking to. We're fine. Everything's taken care of. No. Not everything. You didn't talk to me, and then you got in a fight, now I have take time out from prepping for my show, which puts a roof over your head, by the way, during the busiest time of the entire season, so I can help out with some robot romance rap musical that you didn't even tell me about, all so you don't get suspended! Great instant-replay, Alvarez. So? So? So my handsome boy is Romeo. The ultimate romantic! Who kills himself, right? Pretends to. Well, better be pretend. Ollie. You've never kept a secret like this from me, buddy. Just... forget about it, okay? Oliver, I am proud of everything you succeed at. You should've told me! Yeah, because independence leads to success, right? - Oliver. - Take care of yourself and nobody can take that away from you. - Hey! - I'm going to go do homework. Oliver! Bex? Hope you're sitting down. I've got some updates for you. Huh. This time, cookies. Best neighbour ever. I got you. I just don't get it. You know, I'm the driving force behind the craft fair, I did the all picket signs when Anya's class was doing the suffragettes. I just really think that I can do this on my own. Oh, Erik. You are one stubborn man. No, I am one caring father. Ah! Potato, tomato. Maurice! Anya still needs me. She's 13! She needs you to give her money and leave her alone. Trust me. One wife, three daughters. I learned my place pretty quick. All you gotta do now is... Make sure she makes the right choices. I was gonna say support her choices, but whatever works. I do support her, by being there all the time! But now the Principal's relegated me to this one simple thing. It's like she finds me annoying or something. I Can't imagine why... And I have to do this with the other kid's mom, who I can already tell isn't gonna be easy to work with. She stubborn too? Yes! She pretty? - I mean... Yes, but... - She single? Maurice! I know Piper's type. She's not gonna care about this the way that I do. She's just gonna complain and get in the way. Well, I wouldn't want to get in the way of you talking about me. - Uh... - Anya let us in. We were just, I was... Trying to see if your foot can fit in your mouth? I get it. Why don't we get to whatever it is we're doing, shall we? Sooner we're done, sooner I can get back to work, and you can get back to saying such nice things about me. I'll leave you to it. Play nice! Thanks, Maurice. I... have a little bit more wood I've just gotta get from beside the house. Yeah. If you've got other things to do, you can go. Oh it's fine, it's fine. We can knock this out in what, an hour? Two? Come back tomorrow. Paint it. Done. I wish... Dad! Uh, we don't have to build stuff, right? Uh... We're not the ones in detention. I mean, I can help build stuff, but... Mr. Fridman gave us some homework that's due in a couple of days, and I don't know, I should probably get to that because... Uh, I'm gonna go watch Gazzy stream. She's going live soon. You watch Gazzy? The streamer? I've watched her gameplay a couple times, it's crazy. We're gonna go do homework. Uh! You guys should stay out here. At opposite ends of the yard. Where we can see you. It's homework, Erik. They're going to play nice. Please play nice! Shall we get started? So, have you built ever made a set or worked with power tools? I mean, it's okay if you haven't. I can teach you. Or it would just be faster if I did it. Thank you, Erik! That is so helpful. What a gentleman. But when we get a few steps down the line, you're gonna have to replace the pad on your belt sander. Abrasive's a bit worn. My dad had a woodshop growing up. He pretty much built every piece of a furniture in our house. I picked up a couple things. Not afraid to get messy, tough guy. Okay, okay. I see. Well, I happened to work in carpentry right out of high school, so... I also picked up a few things. Course you did. So, why don't we get started with... Oh! Swords. There. Done. I can take care of that. Uh, I can take care of that. If you just wanna pass me the tools, I can do that. Sure, yeah, of course! Just pass me that pencil? Thanks. You know, you can sand the swords after I've finished cutting them out. Sort of like a "I wash you dry" situation. Sorry, I wasn't listening. I was too busy starting the work. I mean, someone's got to. Uh... That's actually pretty, uh... It's pretty... Amazing? The best? Yeah. Sorry if I'm "getting in the way." We'll see about that. Okay. Whoever's is better... Because they've been involved in their kid's schooling and theatrical experience takes charge. What do you say? You're on. I'm gonna be the most involved parent there ever was. Oh! I've already got that trophy. I bet you do. Show time, Ernie. - And it's Erik by the way. - I know. - With a K. - Hmm. - Easy over there. - I got it, captain, give up. Are our parents fighting? And to think the Principal gave them the talking too. My Mom's pretty competitive. And it looks like your Dad is, too. As long as he's leaving me alone instead of forcing me to live inside bubble wrap, I'm good. It's a pretty good distraction, actually. Mom's not demanding I finish homework three years before it's due. You know, if we keep them distracted with each other... We're free to do whatever we want. I might even read a graphic novel! - I might run with scissors! - Please don't do that. No promises. The stream starts in a sec. Let's go. Alright. This is gonna be good. Anya! Got you, Romeo. No, no! You can have two nosebleed tickets with 10 % off. I don't just give court side tickets away! You think I run a charity here?! Get a grip of yourself! Come in! Okay, okay, Mom. I gotta go. I'll see you at home. Christopher! My favorite guy in charge of payroll. Ooh. A zinger from Alvarez. She shoots... She scores! It's not snowing outside? Hmm? Oh, yeah. Sawdust. I was helping build... You know what, doesn't matter! What's up? Bex said you wanted me to stop by before setting up for the show. Yes! Glad you came by. Now, you know you're doing a great job. Numbers are up, you're huge on socials. The fans are obsessed with you, I'm obsessed with you. I tell people all the time, "That Alvarez is amazing, the best! She can do no wrong!" Thank you, thank you. But I wanna talk about what you did wrong. I couldn't help but notice on the last show your little slip-up as we went live. I know! I'm so sorry. My son's school called and... It doesn't matter... No, it does not! Those pesky kids! Always getting in the way. You don't have kids, do you? And I thank my lucky stars every day. So do I. You wanna know what's important? My next point. Garreth. Oh! Garreth, Garreth, Garreth! He's crushing it. And he just had his little engagement! So sad. And now, he's retiring. What? Garreth's retiring?! I know, I know! Shh. We've gotta to keep it under wraps. They're gonna have a huge press conference after his last game. But this puts a lot of pressure on me. I've gotta come up with this huge presentation with the highlight reels and photos. It's a huge task and I've got so much on my plate already! God! Wow, it's almost like you want someone else to take on this massive, last-minute responsibility. You'd do that, Alvarez? You're so good! You're so good! I would, I would. I want to. I just have a lot going on outside work right now, so... Oh, I got an update for you. I've been hearing some whispers through the grapevine. Guess who wants to start their own sports panel show? - Who. - Michael Jordan. Kidding. Shaq. It's a new show. He's looking for people. - Shaq? - Yes. And with the people in the NBA already loving what you do, they could certainly help you build something big. Maybe out in California... If you do well with this presentation. I will! I will. As long as you stay focused. You know I will. Good one, Alvarez! Crushing it! - This is awful. - This is awful. I think the guests are getting better brushes than you. So, what'd my boyfriend want? Bex, I'm gonna need your help. My cousin makes fake IDs and I can pretty easily sneak us into Quebec. No. No, no. I may have voluntarily taken on, I'd say, a ton of work. But I have to help with the show, for Oliver. And for macho man, Erik! He sounds dreamy. Snap out of it! Will you help me? With anything. Oh, I can always count on you in scary situations. Love is always worth the risk! - Bex! - Sorry. There. Done. Only eight splinters. Next job! Erik! Ah! Yeah. Sorry. I'm trying to see what's next on the list. What are you doing? Do not set up a screen. I'm just in the middle of something right now. You know, I have to admit, your swords are really good! You should just make more swords! More swords? I already made six! We only need three. You insisted on back-ups. Look, I don't know theater, but I don't think we need two back-up swords for every sword. You can never have enough. Let me guess, you were an only child. - Yeah. How did you know? - Mm-hmm. Look, this needs to be right, it's for Anya. So, I'm gonna take care of it. Okay. Your daughter might be Juliet, but my son is Romeo. And his name comes first on the poster. Look, I'm around strong-headed men every day of my life. Here is the play: I'm gonna help. You're gonna get over yourself. Simple enough? You know, you're forward, I'll give you that. - Thank you. - But I just think that maybe if this... You won't believe it! Dangerous! Look! I did it, Dad. What's this? I had to make a comparative scale model of all the planets compared to the sun. Good, right? What's the sparkly one? That is where the Kardashians live. - Wow! - And how did you make it? I cut a box with a box cutter, and then, stuck everything inside with hot glue. It's not a lie, you know? The glue gets super hot. Anya! This is a first-degree... This burn could've been a lot worse! And if this had gone up, it would've been a Class A fire. The whole house could've gone. You can't do this without... Exhale. I'm fine. But I am late. So... Bye. Bye! I mean, she seems fine doing stuff by herself. Let's just divide and conquer. Faster I get this done... Faster you can get back to keeping an eye on her. Faster I can get back to what may be the most important assignment of my career. Ernie? Uh, Erik. I can help you get your life back quickly, if you help me get back to my work. Deal? Deal. Rock on. And we were only one three-pointer behind! But our Gold got kicked in the nuggets tonight and we're headed to a game five. I think we can agree they need to pull out all the tricks if we're gonna win this next game. Hey. Wow. It's beautiful. So's the work you're doing. I think it's going well. Do you think it's going well? I hope it's going well. Look, my dad hasn't been hovering over my shoulder for a week. Everything seems good to me! That looks very unhealthy. Look. Here. Made you a bowl. Thank you. I won! Oh! Come on! Okay, what did you think? It's so sweet. I love it! It's sugar on sugar on sugar, what's not to like? So should we, I don't know, rehearse our lines? That seems a lot like homework to me. Yeah, but this is actually fun! Plus, you'll be doing it without Mr. Lane's supervision. Okay, good point. I'm in! Scripts! Okay. Alright, the fountains, I made expertly. - At the theatre, check. - Hmm. The staircase, you did very well. Very well, thank you. Check. And I think that's it. Great, well we are on track for me to keep being the best. - What was that? - Hmm? Donuts anyone? Maurice, thank you! Look at all this work, you dynamic duo of delinquents! Might I say, this is very good. Thank you! He means me. What?! "Love is smoke, made with the fume of sighs!" You don't know that quote? Well, why would you? It's only from the most famous play of all time. The Bard's renowned romance? Romeo and Juliet! Thought you'd know it by now. Told you I'd do better. Maurice agrees. What? He was talking about me. He was talking about me! Okay. I see how this is. I see your sets and I raise you advertising. - Hmm. - Hmm. And now, the Championship game is so close, we can almost taste it! In tonight's game, our Gold were no chickens, leaving the Raptors pretty much extinct, after Garreth executed incredible play after incredible play... And speaking of incredible plays: East Adler Middle School's production, Romeo and Juliet 3000 opens in just two weeks. Going to see that show is one heck of a slam dunk. I'm Piper Alvarez. Good night. We're out. Okay, you definitely beat Erik now! But did my boyfriend know you were gonna do that? He did not. Oh, and he is not going to love that. But you did beat Erik! Worth the risk, huh? Absolutely. Alright, alright. I'll admit, that was a good play. Okay, first of, obviously. A captive audience of a few hundred thousand? And secondly, thank you. I mean, it's not the way I would've said it, but still good. Okay, so how far do we need to extend the balcony? Uh, about a foot and a half if it's gonna match with everything else on stage. Right. Jeez. Mr. Lane has a vision, but no precision. Uh, should we head back? Start fixing? Yeah. Come on! Okay, okay. Let's go again. - Hurry up then! - Fine! You're gonna do great. If I touch your hand, but you think it's dirty, I'm not gross, just being flirty. At the risk of seeming hasty, I'll give you a kiss, M'lady... I don't get this at all. This is really different than the Shakespeare I read in school. It's a "reimagining." Woof. Man, you gotta move while you talk. You've got to step towards me and then move back. I can't! I'm trying. It's just, I'm used to being on a court, not a stage. Maybe I shouldn't have even gone to try-outs. It's auditions. You know, actually, it's fine. It's fine. Let's just go again. If I touch your hand, but you think it's dirty, not gross... He's struggling. I wanna help him, but... I'm not a drama teacher. I don't know this stuff. You didn't know about building sets either, but hey, you're here and you're doing it. And you're not awful! Thanks. Let's do it again. If I touch your hand, but you think it's dirty... Shakespeare isn't that different than basketball. Aw, you're about to break into an emotional but stilted musical number too? Okay, okay. Hear me out. Actors need to leave their whole selves on the stage, right? And the players have to leave it all on the court? Exactly! There's passion, and there's sweat and tears. And a hungry crowd. It's just a different play. Oliver! Mom? Honey, you, you're doing great. - Mom. Please stop. - Just focus. Um, what makes Garreth a great player? He gets the ball in the hoop. Yeah! Okay, well, does he just shoot from anywhere and score? - No. - You're right. So what does he do? Break it down for me. Little steps. Okay. Um, he has to dribble, while avoiding getting a foul, and he's looking out for his teammates. Oof! Seems like a lot, huh? Yes, but he practices all the time, so it's automatic. Yes! So. Anya is your teammate and the words are the ball. In order to get in the basket, all you have to do is... Trust my teammate and take it one step at a time. Exactly. And then you are guaranteed to make the shot. Uh, actually, I hate basketball, so... Anya! It's okay. Anya, the basket is the hoop thingy, 10 feet in the air. Oh. I still have no idea what's going on, but I think Oliver understood? I think it worked. If I touch your hand, but you think it's dirty, I'm not gross, just being flirty. At the risk of seeming hasty, I'll give you a kiss, M'lady, m'lady! Yo, taking my hand turns up the heat. While still playing coy, acting so sweet. I'm in for reals! I wanna bag a winner, not just a dance with a street-wise sinner. That's as far as we've rehearsed. Can we go now? Ollie, that was amazing! You played through. You crushed it. Come here! Thanks, Mom. - Bravo! - So good. That was awesome. Okay, bye. I've... never done that. We've never worked like that before. It paid off! Yeah, I guess it did. Excuse me? Excuse me, what are you two doing on my stage? Re... Rehearsals don't start for 40 minutes. Yeah, we were just dropping the kids off, so we though we'd map out the sets. Marvelous! Just keep working exactly to my specifications. We're getting a lot of professional attention about the show. I tweeted about it to Lin Manuel-Miranda, and his agents got back to me and said, "Please stop!" Uh, who is Lin Manuel-Miranda? Get out of my theatre. Yeah, okay. We gotta go paint some sets anyway, so... Go! Two minutes, everybody! Where's Piper Alvarez? She'll be here. Any second now! It's Piper Alvarez. Fire away. Piper! Sweet Pied Piper. Where the heck are you?! I'm getting more nervous than when I went on a date to a KISS concert. I got pulled up on stage, but I'd never heard KISS before. I started singing "Sweet Home, Alabama" and was taken out by security... I am here! I am here. Ready to go! Where have you been?! I was just leaving you a message. Can you tell I'm sweaty? I was painting this leather-robot-face mask and I got these cogs glued to my pants and... You know what? I am here. I'm ready to roll. Please tell me you prepared my copy? Copy's done for your show, Gold are going to game 7! - Yeah! - So exciting! But you're gonna need Garreth's presentation, like, ASAP. Yeah, yeah. I'm good! I got this. I'm always good with this stuff. You know. You've still got to put together the highlight reel, the interview clips, and prepare a moving and heartfelt speech! That'll take like two seconds. Besides, Erik and I are working together to get this whole thing finished. You're not having fun, are you? Oh, please. This is where my focus is. Uh-huh. You know, I never would've thought to use lime electrolytes for the poison. Yeah, there's a lot of that at the studio... For when I interview players. - Piper? - Huh? That's not your tea. Yeah, I know! I just was getting a closer look. What? What are you doing here? You can... This poison. This the fake one. I think. Is that the fake one that she drinks? Ugh, there's so much poison. Why is there so much poison on this show?! You seem distracted. Me? No. I got this. Right. Right, right. And how's work? It's busy. It's great. It's very busy. I imagine it would be, with the Gold in finals. - What? - I said that. - You like basketball? - Yeah, of course. - You never said anything. - I haven't really had a chance. I've been focused on my own things. Much like Garreth when he's got a court full of teammates but he's dead-set on making that goal. Yes! Exactly! I've been saying that. Wait. What?! What? You're the one that keeps pointing it out. You know, "The superstar is a superstar for a reason." You just quoted me to me, what is happening? You're Piper Alvarez. I never miss "In the Hoop". Well, you never said anything. It wouldn't have mattered if you were Garreth himself, our kids were fighting. Yeah, it's true. That's all that mattered. But yeah, I love basketball. You know, Lydia and I met at a game when we were 17. She was a cheerleader. I was a point guard. Hmm. You never turned pro? Let's just put it this way, Principal Hosen probably has a better jump shot then I do. No, I became a fire fighter. Oh? Look, I'm used to putting out fires. So, why don't you tell me what's going on? Oh, hmm... Okay, well, our deal was: we finish for the show quickly, so I can work on this massive presentation, but the show is taking so long. Which is fine! It's just, there's just so much. And there's a lot riding on both so... So, why don't you let me help you? No, no, no. I'm good. My assistant gathered a bunch of materials, I just need to comb through them and assemble it, and then write the copy, and... You know what? It doesn't matter. I will handle it. I handle everything. I don't need your help. - I offered. - I didn't ask. Yeah, I know. I offered. I... can't. It's okay to let people help you for a change. I mean, look at you! You're at the point where you're almost drinking paint water. Okay, I appreciate the offer, I do. But I just need to... Mom! You gotta let Erik help. He pretty much did every single one of Anya's assignments and she got all As. I was more of a guide, really. Were you two eavesdropping on our conversation? Silver-lining: at least they're getting along. Look, I won't even tell you what to do! You can boss me around. Oh, I do like the sound of that. Okay! Fine. Fine. Tell me when you are free to listen to me tell you what to do. Uh, why don't you just come to the gym and we can sort through everything there? The gym? I thought you were a firefighter. I was, but now I'm a PT. I help train people who need to be in fighting shape at any given moment. Firefighters, police officers. Female basketball announcers. Risky business. Right. Thank you, Erik. Alright, then. Alright, Anya, let's go. See you later. Uh, hello? Erik? Hate to interrupt, Arnold Schwarzenegger. When you said you were a personal trainer, I didn't realize it was that personal. And how long were you standing there, watching me? Okay, do you mind if we get to work, Dwayne Johnson? Of course. Unless you have any other names stashed away? I mean, I don't want to stop your dancing, Magic Mike. You wanna step in the ring, Rocky? Huh, huh, huh? Okay. Let's go before you hurt yourself. Oh, serve it up, Serena! Whoo! This is looking good. What do you got? Okay, so we go from his influence on the future of the game, to his charity work. Mm-hmm. And then, you can talk about how you respect him as a person... And a player. Exactly, yeah. We love him, we miss him. Great. Oh! And don't forget his lucky underwear. - His what now? - His lucky underwear. When he got started, his mom bought him clean underwear. So, before every game, he gets a new pair. He's probably got about a million pairs. What article was that in? No, it was a few years ago, after a game. A reporter was asking him about luck and Anya just thought it was the funniest thing. Well, I have to double-check, but that would be perfect to go after the bit about his faith. Yeah. I hate it, being an annoyance and asking for help, but... thank you so much, Erik. Any time. And you're an annoyance regardless, so... No harm done. Touché. Jillian, hi! Mark, buddy. Uh... You're early. I'm here for my 7:30. Oh, uh... Me too. Oh, wait, what? You double-booked us. Unless this is some accidental-on-purpose, surprise match-up? I'm married, happily. We've been working on this show for Anya and I... I guess I got distracted. Can we reschedule or something? Hey, I'm already here if you want me to help. No, no. It's okay, I got it. Hold up. "In The Hoop"! You're Piper? Yeah. You know what? I can run two programs at the same time. It's fine. - My man. - You sure? I... Yeah, yeah, I'm certain. Mr. Rosen! Mr. Lane. Don't you look... shiny. You assured me that my personal training would be kept personal. And now what? Am I a part of some... ensemble piece? This is worse than "Cats". I love that musical. Okay, uh... Please stay. Oh yeah, I'm not gonna miss this. Okay. Let's go, guys. Solid form, Jillian, solid, yes! Jillian, push, push, push! Come on, here we go! Here we go! This will be two, two! You got this, man! Close enough. - Okay... - You got this, come on. Okay, come on! Oh, no, no, no. Where am I? Here we go, Mark. Here we go, that's 200, that's 200. 50! 1! That's it, go. 11, very graceful! - And a half. - Oh. Feel the burn, feel the burn. Okay! Guys, we did it. Well, that was fun. Thanks, Piper. Nice work. You're welcome. I have not been so happy to be this sore in years. I'm gonna have a six-pack by opening night. - Uh... - Uh... I'm gonna tell you what Patti LuPone told me at her 60th birthday, party: "I find you invasive and very annoying." But I happen to think that you two work very well together. Thank you! I think. Just keep building exactly what I've told you. Now, it's time for me to exit. Pursued by bear. I wish. Toodles. You haven't had this much energy in a long time. Piper, you got to stick around. Oh, I'm... No, no, we're just helping each other out. - Exactly. - Sure... "In The Hoop"! "In The Hoop"! Seriously though, thank you. Thank you. I wasn't expecting that, but it's appreciated. Well, I didn't expect you to know so much about basketball. Well, I didn't expect you to... We don't have to keep doing this. Right. Thanks. Yeah. Uh... No, it's... Well, thank you, Erik. I will see you tomorrow. Good night, Erik... Yeah. Bye. Cinnamon buns? - Maurice. - Erik, Erik, Erik. To what do I owe the pleasure? Yeah, yeah. When are you going to make a move with that sports woman? Excuse me? No. No, never. She's nice, but... Listen to me. I've been around the block a few dozen times. Whenever she's here, you're laughing. You're working together. For the play. And what? You're just gonna let that be curtains? For a man who believes in love so much, you need to believe in yourself. It's been nine years. It's only been you. I know, Maurice. Thank you. I'm not trying to stick my nose in. That's rare. It's so good to see you happy again. And I know Lydia would want you to be happy too. Trust me. I was married six times. Six times? But they kept dropping like flies. But here I am! Still finding love in new places. I got a few on the hook down at the garden centre. Something about all that pollen makes them feisty! Okay. Breaking hearts and breaking hips! You take care of everyone else. It's time to take care of yourself. Now, give me a cinnamon bun. Thanks. Betty made these for me. Well, tell Betty I said thank you. Oh, I will. Too much denim... That is way too big. That's a foul. I can't wait to rip this apart and harvest it for parts. This is... I really hope no-one ever takes that out of context. Oh my goodness. I know, right? Because it would be easy. I've seen so many documentaries. No, no, no. I used to have a dress like this when I was a kid. I wore it to my senior prom. They say time heals all wounds, but I don't think I'll ever get over the sleeves. And the throw-up on my shoes. Oh my gosh. It wasn't mine. Uh, to this day, I still can't eat carrots. That's a lot. That's exactly what I said. What were you like as a kid? Hmm, good, I guess. You guess? There's more to you than "Good, I guess." Well, that is pretty much it. Okay, pretend it's your retirement coverage. What would you say then? Ugh, come on. No, you come on! Okay, I... I didn't have a lot growing up. Uh, didn't really focus in school. Guys over grades. Great school motto. I was obsessed with sports. My mom loved baseball, but my dad and I were die-hard basketball fans. Ooh, catch. Oh. My gym teacher would always say, "Alvarez, you're too short to play and you got too much to say." Too much? - No, I think it's perfect. - Agreed. Ooh, look at all this. - Too much to say, huh? - Me? - I don't believe it. - Ha, right? So naturally, broadcasting was my best bet. - Hmm. - Hmm. I... Then I went to college, met Tony. Oliver's dad. We fell in love, fast. Got pregnant, equally fast. And yeah. Yeah. He... He thought Oliver and I were both too loud. He fell in love with someone else. And he left us pretty much right away. So... I was forced to be Supermom. But it's a good thing he left, because he was a volleyball guy. Well, he sounds really stupid. Yeah. He was stupid. So, that is me. And these. Ooh, these are a really good option. Coral glasses. Maybe for Mr. Lane? Or these, perhaps? Ooh, they're a little small. Really? - Yeah. - You think so? I don't think you talk too much. I think you're strong and caring... And you only want the best. You're a great mother, Piper. Oliver's lucky to have you in his life. That's really nice of you to say. Plus, this dress... Ooh! This dress is ugly all get-out. Yes, it is! Oh, wait, wait. Here, hold this. Okay. - Hold it. - Okay. Uh... What are you doing? I think I know a way to improve your prom night. Okay, it's a little late for that, I think. Come here, stand up. Suspect. Alright, alright. Hmm? What do you think? Well, I think you look stupid. Oh, thank you so much. Actually, I think we both look stupid. It's nice though, isn't it? Not to look stupid solo. I mean, ideally, neither of us would look stupid. But... yeah. It is... It's nice having... Yeah. Piper, uh... Life is hard when you do it by yourself. No-one wants to do it alone. I think I do a pretty good job supporting Oliver myself, all by myself, actually. No, no, I'm not saying that, I know you do. - Okay. - What I'm saying is... Maybe there's room to share with someone. Uh... Erik, I... This isn't... Uh... Actually, I have to get this, this is important. My work is important. Of course... Sorry. No, no, no, it's... all good. I just have to, you know. But you got this? - Piper? - Yeah, just hang on a second, Bex. Uh, what's the thing we're doing tomorrow? Setting day, set day or something like that. - Bump in. - Right, that's... Oh, bump in! Bump in, huh! There I go, just... bumping in. Uh, okay. Bye. Bye. Oh, please tell me you didn't hear any of that. Hey! Was I interrupting you embarrassing yourself in front of your new lover? Nothing is happening. Oh, why? He's cute! Admit it. Okay, fine! Maybe he's cute, but you know what else is cute? A puppy! You should get a puppy! Bex, what do you mean? I'm on my way in. Christopher asked me to ask you when you can get the final cut of Garreth's goodbye video? And if there are any clips from the locker room. Wait, what? No, he did not ask me that second question. Give the people what they want, Piper! I will send you what I have of the presentation, it's almost done. All of this is almost done. Home stretch. Everything can go back to normal. Mm-hmm. For sure. Hey. This is the spot! Great, keep it coming, keep it coming... A bit to the left. My left or your left? Just, this way. Great, and all the props are unloaded, so I'll just... Piper, can we talk? But we're good, there's nothing to talk about. - I think there is. - Mom. Uh... Oh, honey! Come here, come here. You look great! Oh my gosh, like a little... samurai magician! You are gonna be wonderful. You always are when you apply yourself and I am so proud that you applied yourself to something that makes you happy. And you don't have to do this alone, okay? I got you. Thanks, Mom. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh... Here I am, Juliette, goddess rapper extraordinaire! Wow. - Oh, you think that's funny? - It's amusing. - Stop. - No! - Sorry. - Sorry. You guys are getting along, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. - I guess. Oh, oh! Careful, careful. I got it. Let me do this. I just... I just think you're gonna make me really proud. Like you always do. Thanks. - Oh, oh, oh! - Crap. No, no, it's okay. I can fix it. - Mom, I got it, it's fine. - Ollie, I know you do, but you don't have to do it alone, okay? I got you. Five minutes to dress rehearsal! And just a little reminder about the tap choreography. It goes... Travel, step. Travel, step. A maxi ford, ball change! And if you get it wrong, I'm gonna lose my mind. Okay. - Wow. - Let's gather up. Gather up, here. Let's warm up, okay? Uh, I'm gonna fix this backstage. Let's warm up, here. Okay, are we ready? Are we ready? Robber, baby, buggie, bumpers. Robber, baby, buggie, bumpers. - Okay, go. - Robber, baby, buggie, bumpers. - Robber, Bobby, bunkers? - Faster. Faster. - Bunkers. - Faster. - Baby... - Bonkers... Perfect, you're great. Let's go. - Piper. - Just going to fix this. Okay, don't you want to talk about what happened last night? Erik, we're good. The show's almost over and our detention will be done and everything will go back to normal. Normal? Okay, well let me take the hat. - No, I got it. - But I can fix it. Erik, seriously, I got it. No, but you've been doing all the heavy lifting... I told you I could support myself. - Piper. - I got it! Okay. Fine. And before the dress rehearsal and tomorrow's show... I want to call everyone's attention to the sets, costumes and props built by Oliver's mom and Anya's dad. Come on out here, Erik and Piper! Give 'em a hand! Take a bow! Yeah. Okay. Alright... Places, everybody, places! Let's go, top of show! Let's go. We open tomorrow. I don't want things to go back to the way they were before. Please, I don't want that human nanny-cam to plug back in. We gotta come up with something big. Yeah. Can we zip-tie them together or burn the set so they have to build it again? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I have an idea and it's actually legal, so... Aw, you're no fun. Oliver, Anya, places! Oliver! Oliver, we're not staying, I have to... Erik, Erik, wait. I... Yeah? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you earlier. I... There's a lot going on right now. With work and a new job maybe... It's okay, Piper. I agreed to doing all this, helping out, working with you, just so Oliver wouldn't get suspended. Well, you achieved your goal, so that's good. No, I... What I mean is I... I wasn't expecting... I get it. Loud and clear. It's okay, you don't have to explain anything. - No, Erik, I... - I'll get Oliver. No, wait. No... I'm not done. What I meant is that I... Anya, Oliver! What are they up to, those sneaky little... - Huh. - Oh. Not exactly how I left this. Open flames with no-one attending to it. It could have spread to the couch and then, to the house and then, the electrical and the... Sorry. I will get this cleaned up. Well, it would be rude to waste wine. Just one glass? Well... Anya? Are you okay? What's going on? We're fine, just cooking. Uh... I'm not even using a knife. Perdue chicken breasts. We thought you'd like it if we could have dinner together. You don't have to stay. I mean, as long as it's quick. If chicken can be this easy, we should have it more often. As long as you're at home eating with me, yeah! Yeah. Oh, do you guys say grace or something? - Yeah, yeah. - Grace. Hmm! Now, this is good. It is, it is. You know, it makes it easy to work. Dive back in here for dinner with Anya. It's high quality, it's healthy and everyone's... - Taken care of? - Exactly. Well, for once, we're actually on the same page. Thank you for indulging me about moving the candles. It just... I just feel better having them close by. - I mean, safety first. - Thank you. Uh, I noticed a photo of Anya's mother in there. She's beautiful. She was. Actually, she was more than that. She was amazing. She became a partner in a law firm right out of school. She was smart, and I mean really smart. You would think that would make her tough, but she was caring. She had this amazing way of making people feel relaxed and at home. I used to be so tightly wound. Used to be? Oh, funny. Thank you. Uh, what happened? Is it okay that I ask that? I'm sorry, actually you don't have to answer that. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Uh... She found a lump in her breast. And we tried. We tried everything we could to fix it. I never thought I would buy sound bowls or crystals, but... when someone you love is sick, you'll do anything. Yeah. Unfortunately, by the time she found it, it was too late. I'm so sorry, Erik. Ah, it's okay. I mean, you didn't do anything. I know, I just... It sucks. Yeah. It sucks. And you said I'm a good parent, but nine years just you and Anya? I mean, that is amazing. Single dads do not get the credit they deserve. Well, it's my job to protect her. That's why I hung up the fire hose, it wasn't worth the risk, you know? Some things aren't worth the risk. I've been thinking recently though that there are some risks that people have to take... if they have any chance of growing. You really think that? I might be... starting to. Anya, stop cheating! I'm not cheating, I'm just better. You do this every time. It's a nice night out. Yeah. Wanna... - Yeah. - Yeah. You know, I... I think I've been a little demanding with Oliver. How so? He's the best kid and... all I want is for him to be successful. I think I just forgot for a little while that happiness is a very important part of being a success. Well, you seem to have found a good balance. I don't know about that. It's scary, letting your kid do what they want. Hmm. I've been trying to keep Anya from getting hurt, which is normal. She's done this play, she does her homework, she's found friends, all without me. Ouch. Yeah, "ouch" is right. Lydia always said it was bound to happen. - Smart woman. - She was. Maybe it is time for me to put the bubble wrap away. For now. Well, we could also cut ourselves some slack. We don't have easy jobs. We don't have easy kids. - Cheers to that. - Cheers to that. Erik, I... I haven't seen anyone in a really long time. It's okay to try again. Bex, you have the worst timing. Christopher. Oh, snap! I... I have to go. I'm so sorry. Uh... Oliver, we gotta go. Bye. Can you believe it? After a rollercoaster of a series, our Gold are headed to game seven. I've said it before, it is true now more than ever: what matters most is supporting who we have at home. Supporting who we have at home, the Denver Gold. See you tomorrow. - And we're out. - Another great show! Amazing, you know, I love you. You are perfect. - But? - Alvarez! Oh, there he is, someone call security. Ha. My office. 9 AM. Can't wait? Everything good? It always is. Except it is not right now. You've been repeatedly distracted and you're using your platform to advertise your toddler's recital. You almost missed a show last week! I know. I am sorry, it is all done now anyway. Nothing to worry about. I knew I could trust you. Now, go finish Garreth's retirement reel. We're airing it tomorrow night. Wait, what? Tomorrow night? But I thought you said it was happening at the end of the series. He's holding a press conference, no? Announcing the retirement is gonna drive ratings through the roof. I need people to see that it's more than just a championship game. It's his last game. Okay, but my son Oliver- - You wanna play with the big boys? Hire a babysitter. I can't wait to see your work tomorrow. You're the best! Hello, Romeo. Mom, you got dinner catered? I made dinner, thank you very much. All your favourites. Even made blueberry pancakes? Mm-hmm. I know, it's been a while, huh? - Years, actually. - Okay, yes. You're right. But you deserve it! And I know it's early, but you got to keep your energy up if you're gonna be at peak performance levels. Show's gonna be so good. I'm kind of freaking out, but I think that's a good thing. Well, you're Mr. Lane's MVP, you know. Okay. And speaking of valuable player... Great segway, Piper. Uh, I might be getting a promotion at work. I might be getting a new show with Shaq. - What? - And if that happens, it might mean possibly relocating. Relocating? Moving? Hmm. But we can't. What about here? What about Erik and Anya? She's my first really good friend, Mom! I know, I know, honey. But you know what? This is really important and it'll be great for us. And I promise, we will be okay. Can we just talk about this some other time? I just want to do the show. Mom, we gotta go to the theatre. If we're late, Mr. Lane will start yelling and when he yells, every dog within a five-mile radius starts barking like crazy, so... Let's go. Ollie. Mom, come on. Erik will be here in a minute, let's go. Honey. I can't go with you. What? Of course you're gonna be there. You've actually been there for me this entire time. Remember the presentation I've been working on? The big one. Christopher moved it to tonight. I have to go to work. Yeah, because that's what's really important. Hey! It is important. It's my job. I'm your son! I thought for this one night, it would be okay, that I would be more important than your work. I have been working on your show for the past month! No, you've been working to get out of detention, okay? I've heard you. Oliver, Oliver, stop. You want to know why me and Anya got in a fight in the first place? She said that even though I still have a mom, she didn't want to spend time with me. Oliver, that's... horrible. That is not okay and it's not true. No, she apologized, really. We're good. But maybe she was right. She was not right! Oliver... You need to stop and listen to me right now. Hey, kiddo. You ready to... hit the stage? - Erik, I... - No, no. I've got black coffee in the car waiting for you. Listen, we need to talk, okay? But if you got some of that garlic bread kicking around, I'd be in for that. Erik, I... I'm not coming. What do you mean? Why? Will you please just take Oliver? I know he's gonna be... amazing. I can't believe you. After everything that we've been through, the work that we've put into this... You said this was important. Yeah, it is. Of course, it is. But I am not a villain here, I am a working single mother that is trying to provide for my family. Whoa, whoa. I didn't say that you were a villain. I am trying to do what I think is best. And apparently, that isn't good enough for you, for my boss, for Oliver or anybody. Okay, well maybe what's best is if you take... Okay, Erik, I like you, but right now, I really don't want to hear what you think is best. Why don't you ask Anya why they got in a fight, hmm? Smothering doesn't work either. That's below the belt. Luckily, after tonight, we're done. The job is done. I understand what you have to do. But I hope you understand what you're missing. Oh, darn it! Come on, come on, come on. Oh... You were so little. Well, it's been a pretty solid season for the Gold. Who do you think is gonna take the title? Caller one! Go Gold! Okay, well we know where they stand. Line two, go ahead. This is such an important part of Denver... Call Bex. Please tell me you're almost here. Yeah, I'm just about to leave. I just had to talk to Oliver. It did not go well. But I'm okay. And I'm coming. I'll call Christopher, let him know. Uh, so he doesn't get upset with me. It's the last thing I need. You're brave. Oh, but I just saw him. Hang on. No, no, it's easy. You just dangle a promotion in front of someone and they'll do whatever you want. It's not like you actually have to follow through. It's a solid management technique. As in, I managed to get Alvarez to do my entire Garreth bye-bye presentation. Yeah, trust me. There's no bright future. Unless you're talking about my bonus. Well, here's trouble. Piper. Bucky. What? It's Bex. Alvarez. I don't know what you think you heard, but I was obviously kidding. I mean, you know that. You're the best in biz! Right, of course. So, you do have prospects for me? Of course. There were many people in California asking about you. - Name them. - Well, there's... No, I mean, confidentiality and all, I... Can't believe you. I gotta go. Alvarez? Alvarez! Alvarez! She's not gonna answer. Okay! No, you are a true fan. I think we already know the answer, but who are you supporting tonight? Come on, the answer is obvious! It's what the sports lady always says. You mean, Piper Alvarez? Yeah, I love her! "What matters most is supporting who we have at home." Supporting who we have at home. It's Piper Alvarez, fire away. Alvarez, please. You know I was kidding. Just... Just call me back. Makeup girl. And... brilliant assistant, listen. We... need an announcer and you know the plays! And you need to run Garreth's farewell presentation. You could do that, right? You could do that. Yeah, of course. I'm your girl. Just one quick thing, though. - What, anything! My hero. - I've been here for years. We've spoken a billion times. What is my name. It's... hero announcer girl! No, it's Ben... Bessie! Uh, I know! It's Bark, Belinda, Patricia! Good luck, Christopher. Get back here, makeup girl! Plexiglas? Ladies and gentlemen, time to put away your cellphones and take your seat, it's time for Mr. Leslie Lane's Romeo and Juliet 3000! We're two young, fun, randy teens. But I'll hang back, peep the rack, unseen. Your boy stays calm, stays cool, stays low. Where is that hot kid, Romeo? What up, girl? Hey, dude. Hey, dude. - Piper! - Shh. I didn't think you were coming. I'm sorry, Erik, for being such a jerk. Pretty much this whole time, I've been scared. No, don't worry. I'm sorry for how I reacted. You need to make the right choice for your family. Well, for the first time in years, I think I am. You know, someone once told me it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. Hmm. I... I need to take this slow, okay? Well, you know me. I go with the flow. Yeah! ♪ Like water to the river ♪ And stars to the sky ♪ We were meant to be together ♪ Your hand in mine ♪ It was always you and me ♪ We had everything we needed ♪ Oh promise ♪ We were keeping to the end of time ♪ ♪ You said you'd never leave ♪ And we'd always be together ♪ But they tried to control you ♪ ♪ And this life couldn't hold you ♪ ♪ Now my poor broken heart ♪ Can take me apart ♪ From you ♪ That's brutal. Yeah. There's never been a show with so much woe, Romeo and Juliet 3000, yo! That was so good! Obtuse, but still commenting on current societal pressures... I loved it! That's exactly what I was going for. Are you a theatre fan? As long as it's experimental and there's wine in the lobby. Excuse me. Congratulations, Leslie. Pardon me, sorry. - Thank you. - Good job. Okay. Congratulations, you're my new favourite person. - I'm Bex. - Leslie. You're so funny, Leslie! - Yes, he's very funny. - I'm very funny. Sometimes, we're funny. No, it's amazing. It's fantastic, seriously. You crushed it. If you want to take hip-hop lessons, you can do it. If you want... If you want, we can do it together. No, Dad, no. Yes! We get matching outfits... - Absolutely not. - Oliver, honey! You were amazing! Come here! Oh, I'm so, so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. I thought you were working. You know what matters most? Supporting who I have at home. That's you, by the way. - But what about your new job? - Oh. You inspired me. I think I might really like announcing baseball. Seems like a home run to me. Uh... Piper, your socials are blowing up! I mean... Piper, thank you for the retirement video. Much appreciated. You got fans, man. Yeah, I sent it to him. It's a wrap. Well, speaking of a wrap, what do you say we go back to our house and celebrate? Yeah! - I love this song. - Oh! Oh my gosh, me too! Let's dance! Well, looks like it is just us gals. - Oh. - Oh, and this guy. Your Romeo. I likey. My hat! So... So. Are you glad you got detention? Honestly, Erik, all of this was so far out of my wheelhouse. I didn't even realize how scared I was. But I realized that sometimes, we can take a big risk... and it might just be worth it. Subtitling: difuze
