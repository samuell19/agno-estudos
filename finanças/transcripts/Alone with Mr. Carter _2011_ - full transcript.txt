The year was 1997. And in Montreal, Quebec, it was all about Ellen Degeneres. She was coming out to the world. And there I was. Afraid to tell one man that I loved him. The uh... handsome private detective next door. No. No. Not him. Him. That Saturday morning, just like Ellen, I was forced to risk it all. His girlfriend, Lucilla, definitely posed a problem. She hated me because on her 36th birthday I asked her if she was going through menopause. What do you think of my collage? It's nice mum, it's nice. I told you the Artist's Way group is gonna hate it. It's going to be okay. Help me improve it sweetheart. Please, please? No, I really need to unblock. Oh, yeah, I thought he was going to help me with the laundry. Uh okay, laundry. Okay, a roll of quarters. Okay. Thanks dad. Come back in afterwards okay. Be quick. Silicon Valley. Great idea for a startup. You mean the United States? Lucilla's brother can get us some green cards. Selling those juicers to your frat brothers didn't work out? Just grab a couple of bags. This time you're really getting evicted? Sorry I didn't say goodbye. Uh, did you pawn your cellular phone? I'm gonna need some advice for my career in law enforcement. You don't need any career advice. You're on your way pal. Mr. Carter? I love you. What was that? Nothing. Hey, how come you haven't finished Don Quixote? Because he's old and he's tired. Hello? Hello? Nah, it's the weird kid next door with the crazy parents. Hey, my dad just applied for a job at IKEA. I didn't know the sold dope ready to assemble. And what if we get caught at the border carrying everything we own in that... Fricking, fricking trailer. I told her that we were going to Thousand Islands for the summer. Besides, at the U.S. borders, nobody cares. You're a clown. That's what you are. - A clown! - Shut up! Shut up! I should have never insisted to wait on your table at the Chateau Champlain! What's wrong with clowns, anyway? Clowns are beautiful. Clowns make shopping malls better. Stop calling me a clown! You'll be just a few miles away from your mother in Mexico! Raphaël Gauthier had been caught trying on lip gloss at the pharmacy. He was always trying to find out if I was gay. I guess he was tired of being the only one getting bullied. What he didn't realise was that I liked Emma Thompson's movie so much I'd remained hidden in the movie theatre to watch it three times. Papi... It's not even the same person and... Let's face it. He could get sick. The don't have the Assurance Maladie du Quebec over there. No mami.... What if he gets a heart attack in the middle of the Colorado Desert? I don't want that kind of burden. Huh? I deserve the best. Mr. Carter. Confidential document. Okay. Men... This was my TV. He's destroying everything. Miralo. And now he's sweating all over the shirt you gave him for Christmas. Si. Hi, Mrs. Guillen. No, the direct marketing with the juicers didn't work out. Private investigation doesn't make that much money. - It's been a great.... - Jesus Christ! Take it off! You never understand. It's always about you. About you! It's always you, you, you. It's never about me. Look honey. I changed all the pineapples for pictures of snakes eating mice. That's nice… that's good.. Where are we going to get the money for the gas? We're going to California! Please don't fight guys. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I didn't mean to be rude. Let's celebrate. He's right. Baby, this is the beginning of a new life. Pero papi... I'm good, just a little... Oye chámaco idiota. What the hell is wrong with you? Gimme the shirt. Baboso! Gimme the shirt. Gimme the shirt. I have quarters for the washing machine. Give me the shirt! - Why do you want it so bad? - None of your business... Give me it. - Give me the letter. - What's in it? That's none of your business. Give me the letter. "Dear Mr. Carter, You are like a movie hero but not the movie heroes of today. You're a real man... Every night I go to sleep pretending that I touch your beautiful white hair. Hopelessly devoted to you. John" Let's go tell your parents what a little 'Ellen' you are. You don't even love Mr. Carter! And what do you know? "P.S. Should you ever get sick, I would always be there for you." My poor baby. You really love him. You really love my big tiger. Don't you dare tell him. I'm not going to tell him. But you will. You're not coming to Silicon Valley. I've had enough. And there I was. Alone, with Mr. Carter. I can't go on pal. I'm just a big zero. Just don't do anything stupid. Her inner little girl keeps fighting with your inner little boy. I don't think she means it. Yeah, well my inner little boy is too old for her. It doesn't matter. She's in love with you. She says you're a real man. And there are so few left. She likes... your hair and... she's hopelessly devoted to you. She said that about me? And I feel the same. Ohh. You know, when I was your age I was secretly in love with a much older gal. But because I was a big sissy. I never dared tell her. One thing's for sure. A sissy you're not, pal. People you love are always in your heart, John. So you will always be with me? Yes. Goodbye Mr. Carter. And... From a political perspective it's okay to be a sissy. But I get your point. You promise you'll always take care of him? You better. Mom. Dad. Mr. Carter and Lucilla are going to California. So long. I know he can be a handful. He's the most amazing little guy ever. Hey, you mean a web-site where you can find anyone, anywhere, in America? Just watch out, Bill Gates. I know you had a crush on her, champ. But, someday, you'll find an amazing woman just for you. No I won't dad. You wanna go for ice cream? All through the summer, the three of us, we hung out. Discussing men, Ellen, ice cream and the gay life we'd have when we grow up. Sometimes I look for Mr. Carter on the internet. But I can't find him. Anywhere.
