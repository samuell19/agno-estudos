RATKING - Sniper... Jasso, sniper! - Where? - Tower. Mordred? - Cover Juryman. Mordred? Where are you Everything good here. Take cover. - Jasso, where are you going? - On the ground. You have no cover. Get out of there... - Mordred. On the roof, sniper. - He doesn't see him. - The base is down there. - We're moving now. What sector are you in? Look. Look at this. Thanks. No problem. Alright, I was a bit... Juryman is forgiven, Jasso. Ok, let's do this map again. I have to go. I've got another game. - What game? - Sorry, privat server. Private game. Have fun. Mordred? Let's pick up where we left off. I'm done for now. Be back later. I thought Mia was here. Are you talking to yourself now? I was going over some exercises. Great. For which test? German. Damn, it's in half an hour. No. School isn't until Monday. Today's a Saturday. You're here in the dark, I barely even recognize you. Honey... this is the most important time of your life. While the idiots work, the king passes by. Hey Mordred, you hear from Jasso? He was talking about a new game. HÄMELAHDEN Lyceum Dammit, Juri, you're not paying attention. I'm not playing with this shit team. Easy, Luke. You look a bit tired. Are you catching up on sleep, Juri? Did something happen? A few friends disappeared. Who? Not a clue where they are. We've been playing together for three years. No one knows anything. No responses. Not even on Facebook. You miss friends you've never even seen? No. Boys your age should be sleeping and playing sports. You need to work on being healthy. Lots of sleep and exercise. Move it. HÄMELAHDEN Lyceum Damn. I studied until 3 AM. Good morning, students. I have last week's test results. Let's start with Helena. Congratulations. Juri... A 5. There's only one test left. Try a little harder, will you? Thanks a lot... The last test of the year is made up of two parts: an oral and a written exam. It's a big part of your final grade, so please try your best. Any taskions? Fine. Let's go. Mia, leave me alone. I don't want to dance. Ever. 'I am Juri, and I am a gaming addict'. It's not bothering me. That's what you always say. Seems like you're not even aware of it. I'm serious. Why should I believe you? You'll never pass the test if you keep missing class. You'll be rotting in this hole while I'm of to university. Look me in the eye. We need a break. And you need to get out of that world of yours. You need to choose: me or your games. Single Juryman is AFK, dammit. Hello? Who is this? It's Mordred. Mordred? Yes. I need your help. Can we meet? And? Sure. What's up? It's about a game. One you can't leave or you die. You know the old factory near town? The one they're gonna tear down? That's the one. I'll see you there. Mordred? Juryman. Your hair's shorter than your profile pic. I'm Niki. Juri Renkosen. You smoke? No, thanks. Someone's following me. Who? Other players. If they find me, I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. Is this the game Jasso was talking about? He was my best friend. But... where is he? Jamppa's dead. He got to the final level and then tried to quit. I can't reach him online, even when I log in under my own name. I'm looking for a place where I can hide for a few weeks. I don't know... Please, Juri. I'm all alone. Do I need get on my knees and beg? You have thousands of gamer friends, why come here? I can't seem to reach the ones I can trust. I thought you'd understand. You been playing longer than I have. I quit. Yeah, right. I won't get into trouble? Of course not. What about the game? Does it take a lot of processing power? You can play it on every old system you can find. As long as no one knows I'm here... we have nothing to fear. I'm sorry, honey. I forgot to go to the store yesterday. It's fine. Is Mia here? I'll eat downstairs Can't you eat with me, dear? Server unavailable I can't even complete the first task. Don't point the camera at me. Stupid idiot. Niki. Was this that fantastic game? 'Smile'? Sorry. I didn't realize you cared. Hooking up the camera is always the first thing you do after logging onto the server. Some nerd's been messing with the router... or he's got a bad server. Should I try another IP address? You should try another face. What happens if I quit now? If you quit now, you're not a player anymore. You die. I want to help you, but you have to finish the game. Well, what's it going to be? Alright. Good. Look me in the eyes. A smile goes to the eyes. This is impossible. Juri, close your eyes. Close them. Imagine something... fun. It's the summer holidays. Friends, beer, that sort of stuff. Think of kittens and puppies. Fine... girls. Do you have a girlfriend? Not really. Alright. Someone who touches your soul. You know? Great. How could they know? How could they indeed. RAT Rat: What the hell's this about? Every player gets different tasks. Five in total. The first one is funny. This task, 'Rat', is a bit vague... Let's get to it, shall we? Jesus, I'm jumpy. I'll start seeing ghosts soon. Hello, dear. I was going to take a piss and almost ran into your mother. Hi. Hello. Mom's usually not doing the cleaning in the daytime, except when she's been working with the animals. What does she do with them? She makes hats and purses and stuff... She sells them online. I made her a website. Not bad. You're good at this. This game sucks. You need to get to the bottom of this. I don't have time. I've got a German test coming up. Just another dumb language, right? Whatever. I have an idea. What's your prescription? Two and two point five. I'm Juri Renkosen and I'm not a gaming addict. Talk a bit lower. Renko... Juri Renkosen. Juri Renkosen. Yes. I'm Juri Renkosen and I'm not a gaming addict. Wanna bet I won't pass? I'm Juri Renkosen and I'm not a gaming addict. Damn, that's good. Dealing with stress. Everyone experiences stress... Everytone recognizes that... Juri. Good to see you're on time. Please have a seat. A little faster please. Thank you You'll find something on that in your textbooks, page 75. Everyone looking at it? This exam is made up of two parts: a written and an oral exam... You're not yourself, you didn't even say hi. - Yes... You look a bit funny. When did you get your hair done? Something like that. It looks good on you. I'll have this one. And the cage. What do rats eat? The same as people. Were you scared? A bit, yes. Was it cool? Absolutely. I hate these exercises. What about you? It was alright. No one at school noticed. Are you serious? That German teacher is so... Hmm. Did you ever think about it? Umlaut. I'd do exercises for that. All we have to de is be there... as long as we can figure out this rat problem. Don't you want to graduate? Of course I do. I thought you were going to help me with this game. Do you want to finish this damned task or not? Sit in front of the camera. Keep that ball in the air. Three times. The third plays again. Go on. Great, Luke. Hey, Juri, try a little harder, will you? Stupid idiot, I'll kill you. You killed him. Dammit. He won't need any vitamins anymore. Rat poison works slowly, so that other rats won't notice. Vitamin K could have helped, but... Juri, it's only a rat. A rat. This should make you feel better. Well, did we complete the task? Juryman, one-two-three. Let them have it. You'll die if you continue. Huh? I'll die if I quit. Yes. Now we completed the task. IED. What's that? You should know. You've blown up thousands in your games. Improvised Explosive Device. Oh, right. This is getting crazier every minute. Great. Play some more. Hah. You'll hear more at graduation. Hehe, hehe. I scored a 9.5 on that German test. Wow. What? I wish I was someone else. It's over. What do you mean? With us. I stopped playing. I see... Everyone needs to exit the building and report to a gathering point. Everyone please return to class. This alert was a lame joke... and whoever is responsible will be held accountable. Why don't they just kill themselves? Because they're stubborn idiots. That's right. They'll either get captured or they die. Just kidding. Improvised Explosive Devices. What do you think they want? Figure out if you can find anything about that online. We'll blow up the factory. They're going to tear it down anyway. Just make sure there's no one around. Right. We'll build some kind of time-delay remote control. Then we can get clear ourselves. Boom! Thanks, Niki. I wouldn't have completed a single task without you. No problem, Juri. Timer That'll be 73 euros. We'll have a break, alright? That girl, Mira... Mia. Are you still interested? No. You don't want to go out with her? Well... Everyone can make something like that as long as you have the right stuff. Even me. Piece of cake. You need a server, a router, and a website. Otherwise they'll block your IP. Why don't we just quit? Yes... Niki, why can't you quit? Because you can't be sure. How did you quit? I hid. I might have to hide for the rest of my life. Niki... Hmm? You're alright. You're not so bad yourself. You could blink a bit less. Should we go somewhere once we're done with school? Go where? I don't know. Somewhere. Abroad. We could go to my dad in Berlin. We could go hitch hiking. What does he do in Berlin? Some new Fräulein. Right. What? Let's go. Come one. Are you serious? Juri. Juri. Juri. Juri. Juri. Stupid idiot. Did I scare you? You saved me... Hmm. Look who's awake. Well, did you get drunk? Hello. Can you remember anything? You were unconscious when someone brought you in. I was thinking... About? Did you have anything else besides alcohol? No. Are you sure? Yes. I love you. Who were you with? I can't remember... Honey... Look at this. Juri Renkosen? C6, that way... Juri. How are you, man? I heard you were in the hospital. Are you trying to kill me? I'm not crazy, I'm Juri Renkosen. Listen, if you tell anyone about this. I'll kill you. Soon you will thank me for it. For what? Now you rest, and we'll go outside in the morning. I love you, dear. Me too. Who was in my bed? Who slept with my girlfriend? That's not a nice way to talk to the person that saved you. Did you save me or just push me? What are you talking about? Were you with Mia? What do you mean? Of course not. Do you think I'm stupid? Juri... you're taking her to graduation. You're a cute couple. You're awake. Yes. You look so pale. Been gaming all night again? Well, let's get a breath of fresh air. And no buts... Let's go. This can't be happening. Close your eyes. As long as we can figure out this rat problem. Do you have a girlfriend? Who were you with? I'm Juri Renkosen. He was my best friend... You are no longer a player... you're a tank... Juri? Are you alright? Yes. You don't look like it. I didn't get much sleep. Been gaming again, have you? Yeah. Sorry... Can I give you a ride home? Honey... I'm so proud of you. Factory Mom... I promised to spend the night at Mia's. We'll come here tomorrow. Say hi to Mia and tell her I like her. Bring her some pizza. Uh oh. This has got to stop. What's the next task? Stealing my life? What do you want from me? Drown me? Fuck me? Damnit! Juri... that's not part of the game. Stop talking shit already. I'm the player. You killed Jamppa. Yes. He only had one task to go: mixing rat poison into the school lunches. But he chickened out. I thought you were my friend. I know how that feels. We'll get through this together. I thought you'd appreciate the same things. It would be your final task, taking that stuff to school. And so we move on to plan B. One week from now, Google will have over a million hits on 'Juri Renkosen'. Hämlahden well become a tourist attraction. People will take selfies in front of what's left of the school. Niki, we're not doing this. You're a player. I envy you, Juryman. Now you're getting there. What about your mom? What about Mia? Let's make a deal. Eat this, and I will let them leave. Come on. There's plenty of time to barf it all out again. Fine. Wait. You promise to let them go? Look me in the eyes. I will let them go. Ham, pepperoni, mushrooms... Mom's been cooking. Have some more. Oh dear. Niki. Niki. Thanks. Mia Kettunen. Thank you. Yes. Juri Renkosen. Thank you. Spring is in the air with great joy and beauty. You're approaching summer, flowers in full bloom. With soft, breathing warmth for everything that died. Hello everyone. I'm Juri Renkosen and I'm honored to tell you... that I put a thousand liters of explosives under this podium... and that this school will blow up in under two minutes. Juri, what are you saying? One minute 45 seconds. Everyone who wants to remain here with me IS WELCOME. My soul shall be with the Lord... full of love and song. Those who follow behind... rejoice, and do not be afraid. That's not Yuri. Come.
