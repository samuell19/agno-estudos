[shovel digging] [vehicle approaching] - [knocking] - [gasps] [knocking] - What are you doing here, Dale? - Sorry for the house call. It's after midnight. Just got off my shift. Well? Uh, you got any Oxy? Not for months. Aw, shit. - You out and out? - Yeah, I've been out. [mumbles] No, whoa! Okay. Okay. All right. Come on. - [groans] - How long has it been like this? Uh, a couple weeks. Happened when I was back home for the season. I can wrap you up, but you're gonna need to go to the hospital. Tried. They made me wait six hours. By then it was time to start my shift. Well, next time wait seven. Till then? I really don't have anything for you, Dale. Why'd you stop? I got caught on the border with my mom's meds. No Oxy? No. Nothin' nowhere? Nowhere. Wouldn't tell me, would ya? I got 10 days left on my probation and the last thing I need to do is implicate myself in a worse crime than I got caught committing. So... no, I wouldn't. Keep it elevated, stay off of it, and go to the hospital, okay? Sorry I couldn't do more. I get it. It's a shame though. Bill's selling for a lot more than you did. That's 'cause he's a drug dealer. [sighs] [exhales] [cell phone keyboard clicking] [cell phone vibrating] [child coughing] Mommy! You're okay, Bear. Oh... - You're okay. Get it all out. - [retching] Oh, yeah. Get it all out. You're okay, Bear. You're okay. You all done? You're okay, Bear. All right? [sighs] [sighs] [alarm clock beeping] [guitar playing] [watch beeping] ♪ I ain't fit to Be no mother ♪ ♪ I ain't fit to Be no wife yet ♪ ♪ I been working Like a man, y'all ♪ ♪ I been working All my life, yeah ♪ ♪ All my life, y'all All my life, yeah ♪ [music continues] Hey. I don't know what's better, seeing you or seeing clean laundry. [chuckles] Yeah? I don't know why you don't get whoever left that lipstick on your nice shirt to do it for you. It'd be a lot cheaper. Maybe so. - Can I get two coffees? - Yeah. Hey, I forgot the creamer today, so you'll have to take it black. - I hope that's okay. - All right. - [man] Thanks. - [woman] Thank you. - The usual, please. - Yeah? Did you find a place yet? - No. Still staying in the truck. - Yeah? Well, at least it's warmed up a little bit - instead of being so freaking cold. - Yeah. - Good old steak and eggs, huh? - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay. - Let me have two. I'm gonna take one back to Jeff. - Jeff is your secret lover, right? - Nah. [chuckles] - No? - Keep the change. All right. [men chattering in distance] - How are you doin', Bill? - Good, Ollie. How are you? I'm fine, Bill. Heard Dale made a house visit. - Who? - [chuckles] Funny. You were always funny. What can I do for you? He just got back to town. And he had no idea that I wasn't selling anymore. Could be, couldn't you, if you wanted. He mentioned you had a foreclosure notice on your door. Not like you couldn't use the money. We'd make great partners. I'm not interested. If you change your mind, let me know? So did he buy from you then? Dale. Well, he's working today. I've been applying for something normal, you know, so I can stop all the odd jobs and whatnot. All legal, of course. And the illegal stuff... Getting better at saying no? Yes. How's the living situation? Not great. I guess it's a good thing that Mom passed before we got evicted. Just have me to worry about now, so... And how is your sister? I haven't seen her much. Well, even after... Yeah. You ever think about leaving? You know, one of the jobs that I applied to is out in Spokane, so, I'm not just... thinking about thinking about it anymore. [chuckles] Speaking of which, I need a reference. - So I was wondering if maybe... - [chuckles] - What? Is that stupid? - Not worried about what I'll say? - Why? What are you gonna say? - I guess you'll find out. I know you think that that's funny, but that's not funny. All good things. I think this is great. A good opportunity to start fresh. Well, your restitution is fully paid. You've got one more check-in, and then, in eight days, your probation is done. Thanks. Ollie. You are so close. Please stay out of trouble. So, you thought I forgot about that fiver you owe me, so last week I took a pair of your socks. If you want 'em back... You know I write shit down. - Hey, I'm Jack. - Okay, Jack. Yeah? - You're that Oleander girl, aren't you? - What's it to ya? Well, I need to get across the border. My leg's getting worse, and I can't see a doctor on this side. Excuse me. You must be looking for someone else. I can't get work! Hey, that's ten. Thanks. Oleander King, you must miss me something fierce. Well, if I do, Ian, it hasn't hit me yet. - Hit you now? - I can think of someone who might miss you, but it's not me. Hey, you been talking to the guys about me? - What? Like how much I admire you? - No. You know what I mean. No, of course not. Okay, 'cause I've had some new guys ask me, and then Bill's been on my ass. So... You and Bill, huh? Oh, shit. You're getting the itch. - No, I'm not. - Yeah? You'd make a killing. - Bill charges much more than you used to. - Yeah, I heard. So if you want in, come talk to me. Why don't you help your kid and my sister instead? [sighs] This is Oleander King calling on behalf of Bridget Sorensen. Yes. Yeah, I'm her daughter. No, adopted. That's... Um... She, uh... Bridget passed away, actually, so... Mm-hmm. Yeah, I have 'em. Wait, wait. "Due-on-sale"? What... What does that mean? [knocking] [woman] Come on, Bear. - Hey. - Hey. Can I have some apple juice, Auntie Ollie? "May I have some apple juice, please?" - May I? - If you eat some peas. - [boy] Squashed. - Not with your fingers. Come on. May I be excused? Had your fill? [Ollie] Can you eat a piece of chicken? Good. Okay, come on. Want your coloring book? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Say thank you. - Thank you. [woman] You're gonna be good, right, while I go back inside and talk to your aunt? - Yeah? - [boy] I want my other coloring book. You want your other coloring book? Are you gonna say "please"? [boy] Uh-huh. And I'm gonna color you a big, fat turd. [woman laughs] You're still sleeping on the floor in Mom's room? I kinda got used to it. Well, what's wrong with your room? Nothing. It's just... - What? - [scoffs] Nothing. I'm interviewing for a job out in Spokane. I'm thinking if I get it, I'm just gonna let go of the house. So, you get this job, you're leaving. Yeah, hopefully. You, Oleander, are not hopeful. Practical, yeah. Resourceful, absolutely. Y... You never hope. You do. Well, sometimes I do a little too much. You'll be fine. You'll get the job. You'll get out of here. Just like old times. Want one? Nah, I quit. They're bad for you. I'm picking my poison. Hey, if I leave, Deb, you're gonna have to step up. Stay out of trouble. I'm clean. I've been clean. Good. - Look, I know this is sudden with the house... - I'm pregnant. Well, what are you and the guy gonna do? - It's Ian's. - Oh, God. Well, that answers that. What are you gonna do? Please don't. I don't need any more of that from you. Well, what do you need from me, Deb? Nothin'. - Well, what are you gonna do? - I don't know. - I don't have a lot of options. - Either you have it... Or I don't? Never mind. You know, I'll take care of it. - What do you mean, you'll take care of it? - Means I'll take care of it. What, with some back-alley fix at Taylor's? You really wanna take that risk? God, you have a kid! Johnny is exactly why I can't. - I live in a parking lot. - No, that was your choice. You could've lived in the house if you wanted to. You're giving away our house, so... - You could get seriously hurt. - Hopefully not though, right? - No, I don't hope, right? - You do. - Fine. You'll move in here. - In a house we're about to lose? What if I found a way to make some money... - It's not like I wouldn't have bills. - But you'd have a home. An actual home. And I could help you out once I get a real job. You want me to have another kid? Really? I want you to be okay. Yeah. 'Cause you're leaving. - Yeah. - [sighs] Where are you gonna get the money, Ollie? I'll figure something out. [sighs] Your hair's longer. Yours is too. - I miss you sometimes. - Yeah? I miss you all the time. [Johnny] You're tired. Close your eyes. Are you sleepy? Yes. Me too. All right. So that is $5,682 due to turn the home over to Deborah Hale. - And when would that be due? - In one week. One... [man] We've sent many notices of the foreclosure to your home. Yeah, I understand. But is there something that we could maybe work out? I'm sorry. It's been a rough time for a lot of people. Yeah. And here we are, trying to keep the one thing that we have that nobody else is gonna want. Trust me. If you saw the house, - you'd pay us to keep it. - [scoffs] Can you let us just give you half the money? Please? I'll see what I can do. [Deb] I hate begging. [Ollie] Yeah, it doesn't exactly float my boat either, but three grand would be better than six. Might as well be 50,000. Money is money is money when you ain't got it. Yeah. [footsteps] If you can get us half the total mortgage in one week, we can redistribute the rest across future payments. That's great. Yeah. Thank you so much. [man] You're welcome. [train whistle blows] - [Deb] Oh, Jesus Christ. - Oh, somebody's late for work. - [Deb] What do you want? - What do I want? - Come on, bud. - Oh, what's up, little man? Come say hi to Daddy. Oh! [exclaims] Oh, Jesus, he's drunk. - [coughing] - Are you sick too? Am I sick? No, I'm not sick. [chuckles] Okay, let's get you inside. - What? - Leave. Leave. - What, I can't hang out with my son? - Not like this. Oh, but you can ask me for money? - Yes. - Shit. [Ian] What are you feeding the little guy? He looks like he's starving. Starving? Well, I'll put him on your diet, nothing but beer. Hope he grows up big and strong and fucking worthless like his daddy. You're a bad mom. Okay. I got that money you begged me for. - I didn't beg you for shit! - Uh-huh. You should be thanking me. - I don't want it. - That's what you should be doing. - You begged me for it! - Fuck off! Get out! Go! Leave! You're a joke! You're a fucking joke! [sobbing] Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Stop. You need that! Hey. Hey! You're good. Okay? Come on. Johnny? [door closes] - [Deb] Here you go, sir. - Thank you. [bell dings] [Deb sighs] - Are you okay? - [sighs] Yeah. Yeah. [breathes heavily] I'm okay. Sure? Are you okay? You ever heard about knockin'? What? Here to tell me what a piece of shit I am? [slurps] You said if I wanted back in, to come see you. - Why? - I thought you were here for Deb. I am. Well, answer the question. - You want back in? - Are you sellin'? I know who's buying, here in Little Woods, Tioga, Watford City. So you can move, say, 500 pills? What, you really have a bag buried in the woods? Five hundred pills. We partners? Mm... Look, you tell people the price, and you don't say my name, you don't say Little Woods, you don't say anything to anybody about where you got 'em. - That's it. - Okay. But I don't sell. - You don't or you won't? - No, listen. You was the one who was good at it. You knew how to deal. And you weren't wasting your time out in Brandon giving people prescriptions, you were getting shit done. So, like I said, I know who's buying. I will set you up. But you gotta sell. Fine. But I wanna move it in a week. Can you make that happen? [chuckles] "A week." Ollie, what, you making plans? Yeah, Ian. And don't fuck it up, okay? It's not just about me. And it's not about you. - It's about your family. - Okay. - You understand? - Yeah, I get it. All right. - Then we start tomorrow. - Aye-aye, Captain. Just let me know when and where to go. Hey, Ollie. Tell Deb I said I'm sorry. Why don't you tell her yourself? [shovel digging] Can I make an appointment with the doctor? Susie can help you with that. We're pretty far behind. It's gonna be four to six weeks. - Four to six weeks? - I know. It's crazy. [sighs] Um... Well, then can I just ask you a couple of questions? - Shoot. - How much over the whole pregnancy? I mean, you know, bare minimum. How much is that? Depends on your insurance. Your co-pay could be as little as 10, 20 a visit. - Yeah. Well, what if I lost my insurance? - No reimbursement. But if you do it right, you can get 12 prenatal visits and some prenatal vitamins. So pregnancy and birth is going to be about 8,000 or 9,000. And if you need a Cesarean, 12. - Being pregnant costs $8,000? - I'm afraid so, honey. Have you considered going home and having the baby with family? I'm... I'm from here. I don't...

[Ollie] Hey, ya. You got any coffee in that old beater of yours? Yeah, you know I do. Hey, uh, how's the ankle? Been better. Yeah? Go to the hospital like I said? Yeah. Waited for seven hours and everything, but... only so long a man can wait. You, uh... You need anything for it? You got something? Yeah, Oxy. Twelve a pill, but 10 for you. Yeah, I'll... I'll... I'll take 10. Yep, I can be there in about 35 minutes. East end of Tioga? Okay. Um, how many? [scoffs] I guess you're pulling your weight after all, huh? [woman] Are you Ian's girl? [man] Hey! Hey! Hold up a minute. How much? You're Ian's girl, right? [sighs] - I'll give you five for a bottle. - Two for 900. All right. You're early. Yeah, I thought that I'd come before the interview. Just get this last check-in out of the way, if that's okay. So just checking in? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. [clears throat] So... how are you feeling? Fine. Don't be nervous. Just be yourself. [sighs] Carter, you usually have better advice than that. Well... [sighs] Just talk to her like you're a person. Sure. - Be natural. - [sighs] I really don't think that I can. I've... You can. Ollie... you deserve this. Yeah. Hey, uh, real quick. Just be honest with me. Was a thermal under a blazer a bad idea? I'd have done an Oxford, but it's okay. Okay. I don't have time to change. - I'm kidding. - [chuckles] - Sheila Andrews. Hi. - Nice to meet you. Whoo! [chuckles] It was, uh, hard to find. - Oh, yeah. - [chuckles] Here. Uh... Okay. Hi. - Here you go. - Thank you. Let me know if I can get you ladies anything, okay? There you go. [Sheila] Okay. Wow. It really is pricey here. Yeah. It's the boom. It just... everything has exploded. The housing is even worse, if you can find it. That's why I started selling things at the rigs to the guys. You know, just, uh, coffee and whatnot. 'Cause if you get 'em at some of the carts in town, they can run you about six bucks and they really aren't that good. So... [chuckles] Well, this is on me. - Oh, I didn't mean... - Oh, no, it's all right. - Okay. Well, thank you. - So, uh, Ollie... um, your probation officer, Officer... - Carter. - Carter... has told me so many things about you. And, um, I think it goes without saying that he must see a lot in you if he's willing to vouch for you. Yeah. He's, uh, pretty great. So, why don't you tell me a bit about you. What you've been doing and what you'd like to be doing. Sure. You know what? Will you just excuse me? I have to go to the bathroom. - I'm sorry. - Oh, of course. - What? What do you want? - I just want to talk for a bit. - About what? I'm busy. - A little birdie told me... Fuck your little birdie, Bill! What do you want? I want a cut. Of what? [sighs] I know you're selling again. And I don't appreciate losing customers because you decided to get back in the business. So, I'll make you a deal. You give me a cut, I don't get greedy, and I don't get angry. I don't know who told you, but I'm... - [breathing heavily] - I'm making this real simple for you, King. You keep selling, you give me 30%, or you do what you do best and make a run across the border for me. Hey, I'll even pay you. That's only fair. You're not gonna lie to me. So choose. [muffled] Mm. Mm. I'm not crossing the border again. I'm not taking that risk. So you're selling, then. I'm glad we figured that out. You look nice. We done? Yeah. [door opens] [door closes] - Sorry about that. - [Sheila] Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah. - I just, uh, have to pee when I get nervous. - [both laugh] Well, let's get started. Okay. [vehicle approaches] [clattering] Carter. Hi. Hey. Hope you don't mind me stopping by. Just wanted to see how it went. No, of course. Come on in. I haven't done a drop-in for some time, so I, uh, you know, thought I'd double up on my duties. Sure. Sheila called me after. Yeah? God. Hope she didn't think I was a crazy person. No. No, she loved you. She said she knows that part of starting over is having a good job, having purpose. At least, that's what she said. [Ollie chuckles] Did she say... anything else? She'll call you in a couple days. I'm proud of you. [lock clicks] [gasps] [sighs] [sighs] [door opens] - Hey. - Hey, what's going on? You've gotta be quiet. Johnny's napping in the back. Oh, sorry. Uh... - I need a favor. - What kind? I had a real close call with my P.O., so I gotta keep this here. You're selling. Nah, I'm just having a big party over the weekend. How'd you think I was gonna make three grand in seven days? Panhandling? Waitressing? So that's why Bill roughed you up today. You on his turf or somethin'? [scoffs] Isn't this getting old? - I'm doing this for you. - Well, what do you want? Gratitude? What do you want? For me to say I'm sorry? For what? You never do anything wrong. You knew what I meant when I said I'd figure it out. Yeah, you did. [sighs] You used to make it sound so good. Going to Canada and coming back with a ton of drugs. Dana's mom got her ARBs, Sarah got her abortion pills, Tom got his kid's antibiotics, and... and Mom got her meds. But you'd forget to mention to me the other stuff you brought. You don't get it. Every day I'm with Mom, and she's dying, and all I can do is get her some medication so it hurts less, so that she lives a little bit longer. What'd you want me to do, huh? Nothing? - I get that we had no choice. - No, I. I had no choice. Because you weren't there. It's not what I wanted, all right? It just kind of turned into this. And now I don't want to leave you until you have that house. I'm halfway there. House or no house, I can't keep this baby. Your choices are only as good as your options are. So are yours. I know. Can you do this without getting caught? - Yes. - Are you sure? Of course not. [sighs] I'll keep this here. How'd your interview go? I don't know. I wore a really stupid thing. - You look... - No, I look... I mean, come on. Would you hire me? I would. How many days you got left? Four. You're so close. Don't worry about me. Worry about him. Hmm. [electronic music playing] I knew you'd be back. I'm not here about work. Yeah? You come here for a dance? Uh, I heard you got a procedure done around here, not at a hospital. I ain't got nothin' for you, honey. Jenny, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. Yeah, well, you ain't gotta try. All you got to do is go around asking too many questions, - and you're doing that right off the top. - Come on. I just need Taylor's address. There are a million girls I could've got it from. But you're asking me? [sighs] I'm asking you to help me. Hmm. I like your necklace. - No. - Your earrings. [sighs] Fine. [scoffs] [electronic music playing] What, you never seen a woman before? Come on. Eyeballs in your head, motherfucker. You ain't gettin' none. [chuckles] Fuck that guy. Fucking guys in this town. Here. Oh, come on. Really? You know where I live. - All right. - Yeah, I need more people. People who want to buy more and are willing to spend more. There's a rodeo tonight in Minot. Those guys pop Oxy like there's no tomorrow. - You know any of 'em? - My boy Beau rides, man. You trust this boy, Beau? Yeah, I do. They're gentlemen. No worries. They got a lot of money. [crowd chattering] [announcer over PA, indistinct] [horn sounds] Hey, are you Beau? [Bill] Well, well. That was quick. - Here. - Hold up. I'm on a schedule. What? Where'd you get all this? I sold. More skills than anyone needs, you got it. You sure you don't want to make that trip over for me? How much would you pay me? Fifteen hundred. You're thinking about it, ain't ya? I don't have to know you to know you. [ringing] Hello? Oh, okay. Yeah, I can pick it up today. Nope. The wooden urn is fine. [latch clicks] [sniffles] - [knocking] - What? [clears throat] Oh. - Hi. - Hi. I'm glad you're here. You wanna sit down? [clears throat] Oh, that's just too far. [chuckles] What? Will you come here? - Mm... - Promise I'll just hold your hand. - You shouldn't trust me. - [chuckles] But be adventurous. [laughs] Okay. [sighs] - See, that's all right. - [breathes heavily] I made a decision, and... I want to tell you. Okay. It's okay. I found out I'm pregnant. Okay. And I'm not going to have it. What? - Yeah. - Wait a minute. What... - Okay, um... - Yeah. Listen, if this is about money... No, it's not just about money. I can get food. I can get clothes. Having a baby is more than buying food and clothes. - Do you want to get married? - No. We can get married. Johnny has always been more than enough for me. - What? - And you know I can't depend on you. I'm... - I have a good thing going with Ollie. - Oh, no, Ollie's leaving, Ian. Ollie is leaving, and we've gotta let her go. - [sighs] - You can depend on me. I... I can't. - I can do better. - You can. - [kisses] - [Ian sobs] I'm sorry. [sobs] [Johnny] Where is it? What happened? Deb? What's going on? I had a plan, you know? I was gonna go to Taylor's tonight. - Oh, no. Why? - I didn't even make it. I went home to drop Johnny off at my neighbor's, and, well, home was gone. They towed it away, everything I had, everything was in there. - Our money... - Wait, what? The trailer... The trailer is gone. How? What do you mean, it's gone? Who took it? They've been threatening for weeks. I never thought... You didn't think to mention that when I put everything in there? No, I never thought that they'd actually do it. Yeah, 'cause you never think. Fine. I'll talk to Bill. I'll borrow a couple hundred. We'll get it out of the tow. My name's not on the paperwork. I basically just took it over when someone left. Fuck. - What if they find the stuff? - Fuck. What if they search the trailer? Deb, why are you so good at fucking things up? - How was I supposed to know that they... - God, you are such a mess! Everything is a mess and I'm always the one that has to clean it up! I'm so tired of that. I'm so fucking tired of you! - No one is asking you to do anything for me, Ollie! - [Johnny] Mommy? Johnny, stay in there! What are you... You don't get to do that. You don't get to run off and make me feel like shit! You don't get to do that anymore! You're too kind. [rock music playing on stereo] Hey. What are you doing here all by yourself? I'm not in the mood to talk. Come on, you'll talk to me, won't ya? I don't know you, and I don't want to. Fuck you, bitch!

It's the cheapest one they had. Such a force of nature in such a little box. Yeah, that's the way it goes. Where'd you go? Got drunk, drove around. I got into the trailer, but all the money and the pills were all gone. Oh, Christ. You were always the better drunk driver. There's no such thing as a good drunk driver. - Then what are you? - Bad. [both chuckle] - I did get some of your stuff. - [groans] And you've still got clothes here, so... Small victories, I guess. What happened to the stuff? I don't know. There's not a lot of legal recourse for drug dealers, you know. Deb, come on. You're pregnant. It costs $8,000 just to have a baby. I did try to figure things out on my own, you know. I went to the women's clinic, and they told me that with check-ups and vitamins and delivery, without insurance, it's $8,000. She was sure to give me this though. Closest place for an abortion, she said. Where is it? - Hundreds of miles away. - Well, I can get you there. Hundreds of dollars more than I can afford. And if Taylor's is off the table... I'm starting to see why Canada's so appealing to people. - I'll take you up, get you sorted out. - No. - Bring you back. - No. Bill's been asking me to take something across for him. I'll go up, he'll pay me, I'll take you. - Same difference, huh? - No. It's your choice. I can get you up there if you want. What would I have to do? Go to the Carabans for a Canadian health card. - They took over when I stopped. - No. Hey, there's no way around it. What went wrong last time, when you got caught? I forgot to be scared, 'cause I liked it too much. [exhales sharply] [Ollie] Hey, Johnny. Have you ever seen a buffalo before? - Look. - [Johnny] Buffalo? [Ollie] Yeah, buffalo. - [Johnny] Oh, it's a buffalo! - [Ollie] Yeah. They're usually pretty grumpy, but that one looks like he's smiling. Must be you. [both chuckle] Pretty neat, huh? - Don't. - [knocking] All right. - All right, keep building. - [girl] Okay. Oh, visit so soon. Hey, kiddo. [Ollie] Can we talk? Sweetheart, you remember Ollie, right? - Yeah. - [Ollie] Hey, Jody. - Hi. - This is Johnny. Is it okay if he hangs out with you for a little bit? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Hey, sweetie, why don't you tell Johnny about what happened to Grumpy Bear? "Grumpy Bear"... that's what we call him in the morning when he wakes up. [Ollie, Jody chuckle] Hey, Johnny? When you cough, remember to cover your mouth, okay? [Jody] Johnny, wanna help me with this? - Three thousand. Take it or leave it. - [chuckles] I can go tomorrow. Okay. MRIs are in here, and what you're gonna drop off is in here. It's a pill mill run? [sighs] Why are you doing it in Manitoba? Mills are crawling with feds this side of the border. You can thank the meth heads for that. Besides, the closest one is an hour away. Just happens to be in Canada. - What's in the bag? - Nothing you need to worry about. I'm transporting it. I should know. To do your job, you don't need to know shit. That's half the 3K. The rest when you get back. I'll see you in a couple days. Eat. [exhales sharply] You should go wake him up. We gotta head out in a bit. Get your ID. It's not too late to back out, if you think it might not be worth it. [sighs] It's worth it. You sure this is it? Yeah, this is the place. It's exactly how they described. All right. Call me if you need me. You're brave. [knocking] - [sighs] - [footsteps approaching] Hi, I'm Deb. [man] Joe. [Deb] I called earlier about... [Joe] Yeah. Come on in. [door closes] So... can I see them? [Joe] Yeah. We got our... Manitoba Health, uh... state IDs. How do we know we can trust you? Um... Why wouldn't you? It's a fair question. [Joe] Here, take a look. So, uh, mine... mine would look like this? Yeah. How much money you got? [Deb] It's what we agreed. Okay. Take her in. Follow him. [Joe] You'll sit there. Evening. Evenin'. Do you have another one of those? The, uh, machine inside is out. Oh, yeah, sure. Thanks. - Do you need a light? - No, no, I got it. - Colder out here than you expected, eh? - Uh-huh. Freaking cold, yeah. [sniffles] You from around these parts? No. What brings you out this way? I just heard this was the foremost pit stop in North Dakota, so... [chuckles] just checking it out. So, just you out tonight? No, I got my, uh... [camera beeps] She needs to take her coat off. - What? - [man] Take off your coat. [Joe] No one wears their coat in a picture. [man clears throat] [man] Yeah, that's good. - Yeah, that's good. - Where are you going? [Joe] To print this out. Who told you about us? Ollie. I don't think I know who that is. - Oleander. - Never heard of her. - I thought... - And I don't know you. So what? Well, here's the thing. You're a stranger, and you're asking us to do something illegal. So we're gonna need more. Money. Just to make sure you're all right. How much more? A hundred. I don't have that. Okay. What do you have? Uh, my watch. You know, I... Do you want my watch? No. No, what else? I don't... [exhales] My necklace? This was my mom's, though, so... No, I don't think that's gonna do it. All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Give me back my money. - Just relax. - Give me back my money. Okay? I'm gonna go somewhere else. - It's fine. Just relax. Just relax. Give me back... [exclaims] - What are you doing? - Let go! Get me go! [gasps] Let go of my arm. You need to relax. Okay. All right. All right. I have more money. I have more. Just let me get my jacket. Well, why didn't you say so? Just let me go get it. Of course. Of course I will. Yeah. Yeah. Go get it. [man] Joe! [panting] You this boy's mother? Do I look like it? - I need you to step over here, please. - Sorry, I... - Ma'am, I need you to come step right over here, please. - Oh, okay. Thank you. - Is there a problem? - Well, we're about to find out. - Hey. - Hi. I was just telling the officer here how we're on a little trip to see Mom. Yeah. Sorry I took so long. Bathroom was out of service. I had to go out back. Yeah, she's pregnant. Can't hold it too good. Where does Mom live? - In Portal. - [Deb] Portal. All right. - All right, you drive safe. - [Ollie] I'll do that. Good night. Go. Go. [gasping] Get up, Bear. Get up. Drive. Drive. Drive. What happened back there? Well, it didn't exactly go like we planned. Jesus. Those fuckers. You're okay, Bear. It's okay. It's a long walk. I'll carry him if I have to. All right. Johnny. Time to get up. - Come on. Come on, Bear. - Come on. Okay? Let's go. - [Deb]Come on, Bear. - It's gotta be this way. Come on. I know you're tired. Hey, Bear, look at me. Look at me. We're so close, and then we're gonna get it done. Come on, we got to move. Sun's coming up, Deb. - I know, but come on. - We got to get a move-on. - Okay, I'm gonna carry him. - [Johnny grunts] Okay? Careful. Come on. All right. I got you. [Ollie] Deb. Come on. [Ollie] Hey, Ger. [Ollie] Be right back. Hey, I forgot to say thanks for picking us up. I'm always here to help. But I was sure you meant it when you said I wouldn't be seeing you again. Yeah, I did. It's a family emergency. Well, you're lucky. I happen to have a room free. Oh, Gerry, you always have a room free. [chuckles] You got me there. Thanks. - Also, I need a favor. - What's that? You think I could borrow your car? Just for a few hours? Sure. - What's the second? - Okay. Uh, I need someone to watch the kid. Just while I'm out with his mom. Please? Really, it's the last time. We'll see. I don't know about your part. - It's quite far. - Yeah, I know. - What do you think? - Yeah, I think that's good. But I don't know. I think it's too much lipstick. She doesn't look like she wears that much makeup. - Better? - Yeah. That's good. - That's the best we can do, I think. - That's good. They hardly look. [Deb] Hey, Bear. Wake up. Hey, my friend Gerry is gonna take care of you for a bit while I go to the doctor. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Bear, don't worry. I'll be right back. I'm just going for a checkup. Then I'll be as good as new. - Pinky promise? - Pinky promise. [groans] Ignore 'em. I mean, look at 'em. - Their signs aren't even that great. - [chuckles, gasps] Hey. You're all set, okay? If you have any trouble, anything happens, call this number. I'll be all right. You're brave. [breathes deeply] Yeah. [sighs] [nurse] Do you have an appointment? Yeah. My name's Barbara. Mulaney, Barbara Mulaney. - At what time? - 10:30. May I see your health card, please? Thank you. [typing] Hmm. Uh... Just one sec. [typing] [nurse] Wait. [sighs] Yeah, it... it's not working. I've probably got the numbers wrong. I'm due for a new prescription. It... It might have expired. I'll just... Would you mind reading the numbers out to me, sweetheart? Uh... Sure. Zero, nine, five, one, two, zero, four. - [typing] - [nurse] Is that right? Um... You're all set. Uh... Just, uh, - [pens rattles] - fill out these forms, and I'll call you when the doctor's ready for you. [woman] King? [man] What does he want? [Ollie] Two hundred and forty 30-milligram Oxycodone. One hundred and eighty 10-milligram Valium. Here, maybe it's easier if I give it to you. This bag, who do I give it to? You can leave that with me. [exhales] [cell phone vibrating] Hello? Hey, Ollie. It's Sheila Andrews. We'd love you to come out to Spokane and work with us. [sighs, sniffles] I was wondering where you'd run off to. - [lighter clicks] - Just here. You want one? Go on. Don't look so guilty. You earned it. [laughs] Good girl. How was your day? Uh... You know, the best part about the day... is when it's over. I hear that. I'm done. Done with all of it. You're leaving. You're gonna be okay, Bear. I don't know. Come on. - You've got college. - Yeah, if I ace the entrance exam. Which you will. You're gonna have the house. Yeah. You've got the cutest little boy ever, who loves you to bits. You've got me. You're not allowed to really grow old without me. Okay? Okay. You know that I love you, right? I love you, too. [sniffles] - Yeah. - [chuckles] Okay. [folk song playing] [song ends]
