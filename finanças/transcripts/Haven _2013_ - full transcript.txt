We go to you, Roni Daniel, on the segment of the border where a brutal battle is taking place between infantry and armored forces. The name is Bint Jbeil. The IDF is currently deployed in Maroun al-Ras, scouting the terrain... How are you? Fine. We had 3 more casualties today. No doubt the IDF will lead its troops to the Hizbollah hubs in this area, primarily Bint Jbeil, Ayta ash Shab, various places that we have heard of before. It's going to be a night that changes... Don't, I turned on the washer. -When? 15 minutes ago. It's annoying we can't make coffee when the washer is on. We can use the stove. -Then why don't you? Did you call an electrician? What for? It's an old fuse box, there's nothing we can do. That's it? Nothing we can do? So we won't drink coffee when the washer's on, big deal. How much does it cost? -280. It's too expensive. I'll take the smaller one. It's yours for 250. 200, okay? Don't take the small one, do me a favor. I'll take it for 200. -Great. The solution is bomb shelters that served as storage rooms. People shouldn't have to live in them for long periods of time. What are you doing? I want to see if I can blow it up. So you're serious about this. -What choice do I have? Everyone else in the office volunteered. You want to invite a family that we don't know? Not a family. I was thinking... Maybe a couple? -A couple? Okay. It's here. It could be nice. The room is empty anyway. What about all this stuff? We can get rid of it. What do you mean? Is that what you're wearing? -Yes, why not? The IDF is surrounding the town, troops have gone in. The IDF is satisfied with what's going on in Bint Jbeil. I don't think this will be the last village or town that the IDF will enter. You see the images, the terrain... Hello. -4th floor, no elevator, no laughing matter. Especially when my wife can barely move. Moti. -Boaz. Come in. Come, sweetheart. Everyone thinks she's about to give birth, but she's only 7 months pregnant. -8 months, honey. God bless you and your air condition. Was there a lot of traffic? -No, it wasn't too bad. I'll show you your room. You can get settled. Come. This is the room. You can put your things here. -Thank you. Towels and clean sheets. -Thank you. I know the mattress doesn't look like much, but it's very comfortable. We've often slept on it. -Okay. I guess you'd like to shower so I'll show you the... Clean sheets, towels. Where's the room service? If it were up to me, I'd stay. These things don't scare me. But Keren being pregnant, I thought we should come down here. Since the war began, Moti doesn't have much work, so... What do you do? I work for a bus company. Tourists mainly. Business is slow now, huh? -You said it. But I have a friend in this area, he might be able to hook me up. God willing, we'll be fine. Thank you so much for having us. -Yes. We didn't know who to turn to. It's the least we can do. We're all brothers, right? Are you sure you don't want something to eat? No, not at all. We stopped on the way. Thank you. Can I smoke here? -Yes. -On the balcony. -Thanks. Your apartment is lovely. Straight out of a magazine. It's my wife's doing. I had nothing to do with it. Oh, come on. I mean it. She has a knack for these things. These are Australian parrots. There's a cockatiel too. Do they talk? -No. Then what do they do? -Nothing. They live. Do you sell them? When it gets crowded in here I move some to the shop. I see. They're monogamous, they choose one mate and remain together for life. Their whole lives? Like humans. -Yes. Are you tired? Yes, I think I'll go to bed. Me too. Can I get you anything? -No, thank you. Are you sure? -Absolutely. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Goodnight. They seem like a nice couple. I prepared so much food... We'll eat it tomorrow. Are you okay? Yes, why? Good morning. Good morning. How did you sleep? Like a baby. Can I help? -No, that's okay. I can make a salad. -It's alright. Everything's ready. You can sit down. What is it? -He just kicked me! Feel. I told you. Is he a soccer player or what? Sit down, the food will get cold. Boaz will join us shortly. You have breakfast like this every morning? -Sometimes. It's the most important meal of the day. Do you have disposable dishes? I keep kosher. Oh, I didn't think of that. I'm sorry. -Don't be, it's okay. I'm sure I have something in the kitchen. -Thank you very much. What? -What? Are you going to force them to cook kosher? What do you want? I try to do what I can. Did you make all this? -Yes. -What are we celebrating? Nothing, breakfast. -The most important meal of the day. Could you move over there? You're sitting in my chair. Sure. A man's chair is his throne of glory, as they say. Hardy appetite. -Thanks. Do you want a slice of bread? -I can't eat without salt. That's okay. In Hatzor HaGlilit the police orchestra is trying to make the stay in the bomb shelters more pleasant. And in the Jewish Agency bomb shelter... We are in Biranit. We've seen many mushroom clouds rising near the border. IDF barricades prevent movement along the northern road... Do you want a flag? -No, thanks. Why not? It's only 5 shekels. - I don't want one. Have you changed your mind? No, I don't have change. You know what? -No, no. My treat. Have a good day. Do you want some more? -No, thank you. And you? -No, thank you. The food is delicious, Yali. -Thank you. This is quinoa, right? -Yes, it's very good for you. We eat it all the time. -All the time. What's the deal with keeping kosher, Moti? What do you mean? -Well, our kitchen isn't kosher... Rabbi Nachman said, it's the intention that counts. If it's good enough for Rabbi Nachman, it's good enough for me. Interesting approach. I like it. "It's the intention that counts." They're calling up the reserves. -Good. What's so good about it? -They should have done it long ago. Get this over with as soon as possible. -Do you serve in the reserves? No, I'm allergic to dust. As someone who has been on reserve duty, there's nothing good about it. Why go in there? For some shitty politicians? What for? For your country. -Give me a break. What do you think they should do? -Get out of there as soon as possible and agree to a ceasefire. -An agreement? An agreement with who? With terrorists who want to destroy the State of Israel? You're dreaming. No need to get upset, we're all on the same side. Who's getting upset? Pass the salt, please. What about our abducted soldiers? -What about them? They abduct them and we're supposed to sit back quietly? And you think you'll find them if we go in there? -I don't know. You think the Hizbollah will say, "sorry, "we didn't know it'd upset you, take them back"? -No. But at least they'll never mess with us again. -Bullshit... You're being brainwashed. You're reciting slogans. Fine. It's easy for you to talk from your cozy apartment in Tel Aviv. You have no idea what it's like to live near the border. You have no idea what it's like when rockets are fired at your home. At least I was in Lebanon. What did you say? I said at least I was in Lebanon. -Yeah, I heard you the first time. We should have laid into them a long time ago. Finish them off once and for all! -That's enough. I can't listen to this. "Lay into them", you sound like a thug from the hood. How about thinking before you talk. Ever try that? Screw this... Fuck. Excuse me. Happy now? Moti... -Did you see how arrogant he was? Thugs from the hood, that's what we are. -He didn't mean it. He meant every word. I'm outta here, don't need any favors. Listening to his remarks whenever we watch the news. I'm sorry, I can't take it. Where will we go? -I don't know, but we're leaving. Don't worry, sweetie, it'll be fine. -How? We discussed this already. We don't have money for a hotel. We'll work something out. God willing. He'll be fine. He just has to calm down. From now on, no politics. The coffins of 31 year old Baha and 24 year old Muhammad, both from the Mana family, were brought into the mosque before their funerals. The country has gone mad. People are being killed daily... Look at them. -What? They don't care what anyone says. They're trying to incite the Arab sector against the Arabs. You got us into a war, we didn't want it... We shouldn't be a part of it. -Coffee anyone? Of the 40 civilians killed in this war, 12 were Muslim Arabs. I'll make coffee. The Israeli Arabs don't know who to be more upset with, but they feel that the Israeli government is responsible... The fuse blew. Is the washing machine on? -No. I put Moti's pants in the dryer. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was a problem. -That's okay. Where's the flashlight? -I have no idea. Here. Thanks. It's an old fuse box, you can't use the washer or dryer and the electric kettle. Did you turn it off? -Yes. Let there be light. What's wrong? -What? I'm boiling. I'm gonna drown in a puddle of my own sweat. Bring the fan closer. -It doesn't do any good. Don't you think there's something odd in this house? What's odd is sleeping with no airconditioning in this heat. No. I mean the fact that they don't have kids. So what if they don't have kids? Does that mean their life is over? Why stress over it? I'm going to cool off by the airconditioner. Hey. Are you hot? Yes, I'll turn it off if you want. No, that's okay. Boaz will be delighted. This way it doesn't make noise. Is the heat keeping you awake? You could say that. There's no flow of air in this apartment. The construction sucks. I opened the balcony door, all the windows and there's no breeze whatsoever. Yep... You can leave it on. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Hello? Yes, speaking. No, this isn't a good time, Ilan. I know. What can I do? I'll work it out, God willing. Why restrict my credit? You have to consider the circumstances. We're at war, what can I do? You know I usually have lots of work in the summer. There's no work now, where will I get the money from? Will the bank collapse if I pay it back in installments? Then who is it up to? You know I'm good for it, right? What do you mean "it's not about that", of course it is. Are you threatening me? Ilan, forget it. I can't talk now. Fine. I'm in the middle of something, I can't talk, okay? Have a good day. Don't expect too much. You get the shittiest trips because you're a temp. That's okay. I can deal with that. Good morning. -Hi, Eti, how are you? Fantastic. It's nice here, isn't it? -I guess so. Come on, I saw how you looked at her. -No, I'm done with that. Okay, married man. You're gonna be a dad soon, right? -Yes. That's it, your life is over. So, do you have work for me? -Yes. Maybe not right away, but we need people on the weekends. The weekends? I don't drive on the Sabbath. -Since when? A year and a half or so, since my father passed away. Dude, you didn't tell me that. -Couldn't you tell? What can I say... Is there something to do during the week? -No, new guys work weekends. Damn. I didn't know... -That's okay, no harm done. We'll work something out. Let's talk to Eliyahu over a cup of coffee. We'll find something. You don't drive on the Sabbath, you don't look at women. We'll have to call you saint Moti. Hi, honey. How do you know it's me? -Who could it be? It could be anyone... They're getting so big. A real porn star. -Yeah, right. What are you making? -Meatballs. I went to the supermarket today. I bought all kinds of stuff. The fact that they're hosting us doesn't mean they have to cater to us. I hope you're making tofu salad with quinoa too. Sshhh... Yali's here. -Fine. Get me an egg from the fridge. I think you should suggest that we share the shopping expenses and the bills. What bills? We've only been here for 3 days. But who knows how long we'll be staying. I feel bad for putting them out. It's not as if they spend that much on us. They're not using more electricity because we're here, and I use my cellphone. There's no need. -We have to offer, even though they probably won't agree. If they won't agree, then there's no need. -Come on, ask her. Now? -Yes, now. Can you help me with this? -Sure. Thank you. Who's the genius who invented high heels? He hated women, that's for sure. How am I supposed to run now? I run too, you know. -You do? Well, I used to, not so much now. -How much? 2-3 times a week... -No, how many kilometers? -Oh. 5 or 6, sometimes 10. So run with me. -No way. I didn't bring my running shoes... -What size are you? 10 and half. They might be a bit big, but I think they'll fit. He won't mind? -Boaz? He hasn't worn them in 5 years. Are you alright? I'll pick you up on the way back. Hi. Isn't Yali back yet? She's out running with Moti. -Oh. Did they leave a long time ago? -About an hour ago. I thought that records were extinct. I'd rather you didn't touch them. Okay. -Some of them are very rare. I have David Bowie, Frank Zappa, Gomez. You have to know how to handle them. Is it a boy or a girl? A boy. A boy. Moti must be thrilled. Yes, he wanted a boy. -Obviously. Listen to this part. Do you play? -No. Look at this. That's nothing, wait till he gets the hoop. You're kidding me. -For real. He does this every night. There's something sad about it. -Sad? I don't know. Him and the dog, all alone. Yes. They say that the dog is man's best friend. I thought it was the parrot. Blessed are You, God, Who sanctifies the Sabbath. Amen. Is that it? the ritual is over? Good Sabbath to you and your family. Good Sabbath, enjoy the meal. -Good Sabbath. -Good Sabbath. Keren, you're spoiling us. Had I known kosher food is so delicious, I'd have found religion long ago. It's never too late, my man. By the way, Moti fixed the fuse box. He did? -Yes, no big deal. Some fuses just needed rewiring. You don't say. Does it work? -Of course it does. Now we can boil water and do the laundry. Welcome to the 21st century. This wine is great. "In His kindness and grace He provides sustenance to all flesh "Through His great goodness to us may we never lack food "For the sake of His great name for He provides nourishment..." Do one for me, okay? I never wear my hair like this. It doesn't feel like it's me. You look amazing. Besides, what's wrong with being someone else for one night? There you go. -Thank you. Are you sure it's okay for us to come? -Of course. Amnon told us not to come without our guests. And he's the boss, so you don't have a choice. You're not ready yet, I see. Have you seen my ring? -Which one? My grandmother's, with the diamond. -No. I can't find it. -You must have put it somewhere else. No, I always put it in the same place. You always say that when you can't find something. If I can't find something, it's because you're so messy. I know exactly where everything is. -Right... I like playing with your jewelry when you're not around. You got me. The proposal that some European countries speak indirectly with the Hizbollah was rejected. The game is in Nabih Berri's hands who thinks that Hizbollah's rocket fire towards Israel... We're ready. Is that new? Yes. Do you like it? Yes, very much. They're entering in the middle of a night, one after the other, like ducks... How's the meat? -Awesome. $650 is not cheap. We flew to Barcelona for $550. How long were you away? -10 days, until school starts. That's the problem. Had you waited until September, you would have paid $100 less. -What can you do? I want to thank you for coming and to congratulate us on another successful exhibition. Some people think we shouldn't have celebrated this year because of the war, but I say, on the contrary. We must celebrate, life must go on, this is our victory. Not how many enemies we kill, not the rockets, not the tanks. We must continue to live, to eat, drink. That's our victory. Cheers! -Cheers! I'd like to make a toast too. To Boaz and Yali for taking us into your home. You've done a good deed. Hospitality is a great act of kindness. It's heartwarming to know that even in rough times we can count on one another and strengthen one another. If we don't have one another, what do we have in life? Cheers. -Cheers. Hold on, I'll be right back. Just a second. Just a second. I couldn't hold it in. No harm done. Where's my mom? Downstairs with the guests. Should I go get her? Do you want to wash it? Change your pajama? Put your hand on me. Just a second... Pick up your leg. Are you going to tell my mom? -No. My dad? -No. You swear? -I swear. I won't tell anyone. Do you want to know a secret? -Yes. Sometimes I can't hold it in either. Really? -Really. But don't tell anyone. Goodnight. I love your dress. You look like a million bucks. -I do? I would kill for a body like yours. How do you do it? I run a lot. -I can tell. Even if I ran the marathon every week, my stomach would never be the same. Leave that alone. I'll finish up. -Are you sure? -Yes. Here you are. So this is where you're hiding. I thought you'd been abducted. -By who? Anyone. Moti. -Moti? What's with you? I don't know. You're beautiful, talented, smart. What are you doing with a guy like me? You're drunk. Not drunk enough. What are you doing? Stop. Someone could come in, Boaz. Stop it. You're hurting me. Stop. He said we'll get compensation. -For lost work days? Never. They couldn't care less. If I don't make some money soon, they'll confiscate you. Dude, maybe I should drive. No, I'm fine. -Come on, I'll drive. No, I'm fine, I mean it. -Boaz! I'll drive. Give them to me. What are you doing? Three against one, huh? Hi, Keren. Yes, he forgot his cellphone. Are you at the supermarket? Ask them to deliver, okay? And don't buy too much, I have everything I need. Bye, sweetie. Hi, I forgot my phone. -Yes, Keren called. If you look at the street, at the people, you could never tell there's a war going on. As if it has nothing to do with them. Everyone lives his own life. Wait, are we safe? one moment I meant, are you on the pill or something? What is it? I'm unable to conceive. I'm sorry. I have to go. What good will shouting do? The bus won't come any faster. How could I know he'd run out of gas? The idiot kept the engine running all night to keep the airconditioner going. You see what I have to deal with. Alright. Kobi, forget about it, I'll take care of it. Don't worry. What a mess. Strong coffee, one sugar? -Yes. See? I remember. How about you? -No, thanks. Dina, do me a favor, sweetie, 2 strong coffees, one sugar. So you're a pencil pusher now. -Can we still storm the hills at our age? Looks like you're more into storming a bagel. At least I'm not bald. Here you go. Fill out these 3 forms and sign on the bottom. What am I signing? It's for the adjutancy, to see if you can work for the army and this is the insurance. Fill out your personal details, in case something happens to you. We are at war, after all. This is for trips up north. -Where did you think you were going? Dina! Dina! I have to do everything around here. Dina! What is it? I promised Keren I wouldn't drive buses up north. Then don't tell her. Do you tell her everything? Yeah, right? Do you know how much they pay? -I`m sure it's decent. Thank you. All done? -Yes. Maybe you can start right away. Don't you go anywhere, you freeloader. Thank you, Boaz. -You're welcome. Moti, listen, there's something else. Yali won't say anything, you know. When we invited guests, we thought it would be for a few days. Okay. It's not like we're going to throw you out. We wouldn't do that. Maybe you should stay in one of the army bases for now. You'll probably have to be available, no point returning to Tel Aviv just to be called back. What about Keren? Keren's not an issue. Moti. Come with me. They'll see you now. Two minutes. Come. I'm sorry we started without you, I was starving. -That's okay. Where's Moti? He got a job down south, some trip with the scouts... He'll be gone for 4 days, he'll have to stay down there. Like I said on the phone, since you finished paying your mortgage you accumulated a nice sum in your accounts. The first question I have to ask you is if you're planning a big expense in the near future? A new car, renovation, a Bar Mitzvah? -No. So we're talking about a long term investment. Yes. We have several investment options but first I have to know the level of risk you're willing to take. Maybe we'll sell the apartment? -What? The neighbors on the 4th floor sold theirs for 2.300.000. That means it's a good investment. -I hate that apartment. You hate our apartment. -Yes. Now you tell me? We just renovated the kitchen. -Now I hate it. Would you like a minute or two to talk? I can give you a booklet on standard investments. It was right here. I'll be right back. Where is that coming from? Do you like it here so much? You forget you wanted to move up north. -What's that got to do with it? It's not that simple. It is, you're just afraid to do it. What about your job? Your mom? Am I the one holding you back? Then leave. -Right. I mean it. No one's stopping you. You can leave. That's what you want, isn't it? You want someone to decide for you. Isn't that what you want? Well, have you talked it over? Last Thursday, 8 people were killed in Acre and Tarshiha and the number is rising. The rocket fell right next to them and caused many casualties. Hi, sweetie, what's up? I don't know. -Is something wrong? I don't feel well since this morning. Don't freak out, it's nothing. You felt the same way last week, right? -This is different. I can't feel the baby, as if he stopped breathing. -What am I supposed to do? I don't know. Never mind, we'll talk tonight. -Why can't we talk now? I'm driving, I can't talk now. Where are you going? -To Sdeh Boker. Honey, I can't hear you. We'll talk tonight. Bye bye. What happened? Is she alright? He's not moving. He must be sleeping. All day? -Can't that happen? Something is wrong. I can feel it. Something is wrong. Don't upset yourself. I'm sure he'll move any minute. Patience. Bring her something sweet to eat. Did you talk to Moti? He's not answering his phone. I bet there's no signal. There is no trip down south. I called the scouts, there are no trips to the Negev. Want to splash some water on your face? You'll feel better. Come. What is it? What's going on? Get the car. You're better off on the highway. -It'll open up soon. But we're stuck here, can't you see?! We're stuck! Take a right. What's up, Boaz? What got into him? Just family? I don't get it. Is she better off all alone there? Did you get a hold of Moti? He's on his way. If anything happens to her... -Don't worry, they're professionals. Of course that's what you'd say. -What? Were they professionals with us too? I'm sure she'll be fine. How do you know? Maybe she won't be fine. What do you know? Nothing. -Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. You can't understand what it's like. -Fine. Come on, there's room. Excuse me. Think it'll help if you call him again? -What's your problem? You're pathetic, you know that? Do you really think Moti will change your life around? What are you going on about? -You know what I mean, I'm on to you. I'm not stupid, you know. Did you two have sex? -Oh, come on. No. No, okay? Leave them alone. It's not your life, it's not your pregnancy. Fuck you. There's no reason to worry. Everything's fine. Don't worry. Thank you. Is she alright? And the baby? He's fine. They took him for a checkup. She fell asleep right away. Do you need anything? From the apartment? No, I'm fine, I have what I need. She was in so much pain, poor thing. I need a cigarette. Moti. Moti. For 5 years we tried to get pregnant, Yali and I. We underwent every possible treatment. You have no idea... Hormones, insemination, IVF. Anything medical science had to offer. We gave up after 5 years. We figured it wouldn't happen and we have to make peace with it. We'd just ride it out. Wow. Have you thought of adoption? -Yes. We started the process. Waiting list, forms, the whole nine yards. But last year, Yali suddenly got pregnant. I don't know how, but she did. She was pregnant. Everything was going as expected, nausea, vomiting. She even seemed to be enjoying it. Then, in her 24th week... we discovered that the fetus has a heart defect. That he won't live much longer. We aborted it a week after that. We came home from the hospital and since then we've been trying to come to terms with it. It'll always be just the two of us. It was a girl. You can see her now. Is she alright? A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon will be enforced tomorrow at 8am. The agreement determines that UNIFIL forces in south Lebanon will be reinforced by 15.000 UN soldiers who will help the Lebanese army... Do you feel that? Yes. There's a breeze.
