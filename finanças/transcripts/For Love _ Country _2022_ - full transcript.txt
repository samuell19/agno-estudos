Life itself, down to a cellular level. Everything about it is to protect our being and push us further. Nature is about pushing further and adding and multiplying. And healing. A farmer can sow good seeds. A farmer can sow bad seeds. 'Cause a farmer is not a perfect person. However, whatever you do plant, the soil will return to you good and bad, and everything that's against that is just against nature. Despite playing an integral part in the origins of country music, black artists have been pushed to the margins of the genre. A new crop of artists are seeking to change that and reclaim their place on the country music charts. But as Amna Nawaz reports, a number of black women are starting to gain traction in the genre. Congratulations on going platinum, first of all. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, it definitely tripped me out. I'm still like in that moment where I haven't really grasped it all, but I know that it is is reality and I'm not dreaming. And last September, the Texas native continued to make history when she became the first black female artist to perform her song at the Academy of Country Music Awards. You're a history maker, man, like first black artist to debut at number one. Since then, Spencer's song "Compassion," which tackles issues of racial justice, has been streamed more than three and a half million times. It's been such a wild ride. Our first guest has been named one of CMT's 2021 Next Women of Country. She's been praised by Rolling Stone, Billboard, and the New York Times and could very well be this year's breakout superstar. Things are changing.

My mom, she was just on board with it from the very start. She always told me that God told her that I wasn't gonna be with her in Baltimore for a long time, and she knew it long before I did. So, I just wanted to do country music. I fell in love with it when my friend Keisha down in Baltimore, my hometown, found me a CD to listen to. She was like, you need to check out The Chicks. Back then they were the Dixie Chicks. And I just fell in love, went on this whole rabbit hole, watchin' all the music videos and listenin' to country radio. I remember watching documentaries on Taylor Swift and Reba, and they always said the same thing. You just have to move to Nashville. When you realize that you have a passion for country music, you just gotta get to where the country music is. I finally got the nerve and moved here, and it's been eight years. I remember feeling discouraged because my sound was different. I sound like I'm from Baltimore. I don't hide that. I don't got a twang, but I got a Baltimore accent. And I bring all of that with me, because the thing that I've always wanted to do is just make the music I wish I heard as a kid. When I started listening to country music when I was 14 or 15 years old, I quickly realized it wasn't anybody that looked like me. And I realized there wasn't anyone bringing in a lot of the sounds that I heard throughout my life, my childhood. R&B, gospel, I mean even classical. I love that, rock. I wasn't hearing that all the time, and so it may made me feel like an other, listening to someone else's music. Honestly, the thing that brought me to Nashville was the people. When I started meeting people from Nashville, I could tell that, kinda the thing that people always talk about, that country music was a community. Nashville is just this little scene unto its own. There's this thing where country music singers, they go to the grocery store, they go to the same bars as you, they go to the same whatever. So there's this closeness, this community that really exists. I think that it speaks to the culture of country music in a good way and a bad way, because there is a level of nobody wants to shake any feathers because everything is calm and everything is kinda the same and everything has existed in this way for such a long time. If we understand the history of this genre, of this sound, and understand that it is as much a part of black tradition as it is white tradition, and if we understand black people have always been here and have always been a fan of this music, have always created this music. But, I think when you're an artist and you're comin' in, like it takes a certain kinda mindset, a special kinda mindset to be like, I'm gonna start from scratch, and I'm gonna do that on my own. I think that sometimes you feel led to do something, but you might be scared, 'cause nobody has done it. Or very few people have done it. I just had to make a pathway for myself. I started makin' music when I was probably like 11 years old. My uncle bought me a keyboard. By the time I was about 16, I was workin' at Sears in the mall in Memphis, and I met this guy named Chris who had tracks. He said, "Come over here." And I made my first song, and that's when I knew for real, like I knew I had to pursue this as a career. I would always go to LA or Houston or Atlanta, New York. I met a guy named Courtney Benson, and I knew the Nelly song. ♪ I'm getting pages outta New Jersey from Courtney B ♪ ♪ Talkin' about a party up in NYC ♪ ♪ And can I make it ♪ ♪ Damn right, I be on the next flight ♪ ♪ Payin' cash, first class ♪ ♪ Sittin' next to Vanna White ♪ And I was like, you Courtney B. from the song. Courtney was the one that really helped me. That's how I got in the game was just doin' tracks and singin' hooks for Nelly and Ashanti and Chingy or Youngbloods. I grew up in Memphis where Three 6 Mafia was always in everybody's car. And that was startin' to be the sound of all rap music to me. And I was completely tired of it at that point. I listened to it my whole upbringing. I was livin' in Atlanta, and I was comin' up to Nashville a lot, and I was hearin' country music, and I was really startin' to like it. I was hearin' things like Zac Brown Band, records that sounded different than the country music I grew up on. So now I'm listenin' to this music that has this whole band, guitars, and strings and steel. Whenever something's bendin' like the steel guitar, bendin', it's soul to me. So I'm like, this has got soul music to it. And then I started diggin' into older songs, like realizing Dolly Parton songs were so beautiful and Patsy Cline songs that had jazz influence and all these different influences. I was like, the music that I love is all right here. ♪ I could call you a taxi ♪ ♪ We could just call it quits ♪ ♪ We could just throw our hands in the air ♪ ♪ Act like we don't care ♪ ♪ Say it is what it is ♪ ♪ Say I can't forgive you ♪ ♪ And I never will ♪ ♪ Or we could let another sun come up on our love ♪ ♪ And see what time might heal ♪ ♪ It's gonna be hard on my heart ♪ ♪ It's gonna be hard on my pride ♪ ♪ So can we please try a little bit harder ♪ ♪ While we're still here tonight ♪ ♪ It's gonna be hard to let you go ♪ ♪ Hard not having you around ♪ ♪ It's gonna be harder ♪ ♪ Harder than we know ♪ ♪ If we take the easy way out ♪ ♪ If we take the easy way out girl ♪ ♪ Please ♪ ♪ It's gonna be hard baby ♪ Yow. Country music. Well, country music was somethin' always been here. So when I think, when I stepped out, outside the household, country music's what we heard. It's country music city here. When you listen to the songs and just some of the things, the struggles, 'cause a lot of that country music, if you listen to the word and they struggle, and they're just tryin' to put that perspective on what they went through, relationship, with marriages, all that's tied up with country music, 'cause mostly what they're singin' about, the past and the present and how they was able to get out of it. So my perspective on country music, I enjoy listenin' to country music, but I listen to a lot of the words when I do listen to the songs. Music is the thing for me that levels the playing field. Initially I wanted to be an artist. ♪ My savior all the day long ♪ ♪ This is my story ♪ I started doing YouTube throughout high school. It didn't really do much. ♪ All the day long ♪ I eventually had a couple videos that had done well, but just not anything enough on YouTube to really push the needle professionally. And some people were like, "You could write songs" "and potentially you could write songs for people." I was like, okay, cool. Like I'm into that. Let me see what I can do. And so I ended up going out to Atlanta, just kinda shadowed some producers. And that was kind of how I started to level up even more as a songwriter. It was primarily R&B and hip hop, just 'cause I was in Atlanta, and those were kinda the opportunities that I had based on producers and writers that I was working with. But there were some people within country music that I felt like were making progressive stuff than the country music that I was being put onto in high school and college. I liked a lotta Sam Hunt stuff. I was listenin' to some Kane Brown stuff. The genre has come a long way quickly. So I was like, this is a good time for me to bring some of the influences and experience that I have from living in Atlanta for the past few years and try to incorporate it into what's going on. So I was like, I need to go to Nashville and see what is really going on within the genre. 'Cause I'm an outsider in this moment. So I came out to Nashville and then I realized, they're basically writing the same way that I typically write. They're just doing it with some different phrases and they're doing it with some different instruments, but the same stuff that I would do, my process, in Atlanta was pretty similar to what they were doing in Nashville. So I was like, okay. This is dope. I don't have to relearn anything, really. I was like, I just, they're just writing songs based around concepts. Like there's no nothing that would allow you to write an R&B song that would preclude you from being able to write a good country song, because the best versions of both of those things are pretty similar. I think it probably speaks to the storytelling, the instrumentation. Country music is a genre that, even as it's gotten more popular, has still maintained this sense of purity. There's still live guitar. There's still live drums. Even now, again, as we get to this hip hop where there are these country artists that really incorporate a lot of these R&B influences or a lot of these hip hop influences, you're still probably gonna put some pedal still over it. And music is such a wonderful art form in that it's always pulling from different spaces. My earliest memory of music is hearing my mom's voice and hearing her piano. She couldn't express her love with her words or with physical affection, but I could hear it in the way she played. One of my earliest memories is crawling under the piano while she played. When she was very upset about things, she would play. And I loved to hear her, so I would, I remember seeing her feet on the pedals and I could see the edge of her wrists and the edge of her hand. And that's where I would feel moments of connection and safety with her was when I could hear her play. My mom says I was humming before I could speak. And if she was playing the piano, I would hum with her in the right key, And I remember humming and singing to make myself feel less scared. And that is something that I feel like connects me really directly with the black diaspora. ♪ Mmmm ♪ I got myself a secondhand banjo at a pawn shop in Vancouver. That kind of opened a whole world to me. I loved the sound of it, and I didn't know anything about it, but I just knew it resonated for me in this special way. ♪ Hush now don't you wake up ♪ ♪ We'll be leavin' that first night ♪ ♪ Mama's buyin' you a mockin' bird ♪ ♪ To lull you through the night ♪ I met Rhiannon Giddens in 2006. She was in the Chocolate Drops. They were one year in. And I remember just being like thunderstruck when I saw these three beautiful black people playing fiddle and banjos and singing these old time. ♪ And I can't tell my daughters ♪ ♪ All the things that I've said ♪ It was revelatory for me to hear black women singing their own experiences. ♪ Afraid of that bright glory up above ♪ I understood that music has always been the thing that helped people survive trauma. That's how I know how to do it, is through writing songs and singing them for people and trying to connect as much as I can. Growin' up I was a big Charley Pride fan, Matchbox 20, Tupac, Sevendust, Prince, Brooks & Dunn, kinda just everything. My music, kind of the stories I tell through the songs and kinda how I grew up, where I grew up, what I liked to wear, country music fit me better. I moved to Nashville in 2007. And 2007 country was still pretty traditional. Of course I had a few people at different labels saying, "Well it wouldn't work." 'Cause I was black or I had this one dude at a label, I won't say his name, but he was like, "Yeah man, I like you, you're a good guy, "but I'm not sure about how country music fans" "would feel about your people." And I was like, "What?" I ain't. I remember after I signed with Broken Bow my first single went number one, he emails me. He said, "Dude, congrats, man." "I always knew you'd make it." I'm a straight shooter, so I emailed him back, said, "Don't lie to me, bro." "You told me it wouldn't do. "You ain't gotta lie." "You coulda just said congratulations and kept it at that." But I feel like it's our job to realize that there are certain barriers that are there, certain obstacles that are there. And we have to get past that. And the one way to always get past it is great music. If your music's trash, it's trash. That's just facts. No matter what your skin color is. We can only control who we are, what we do, and the quality of music we put out. I grew up in Texas. My church drove us to see a Texas Rangers baseball game. I was in the nosebleed section, and the announcer says, "Please rise as 10-year-old LeAnn Rimes" "sings the National Anthem." When I heard her sing, that's when I was like, I wanna do that. My grandmother lived in a really tiny shack in Riesel, Texas, and when I would go over to her house, she would have hanging on the back of her door all these VHS tapes of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers and "Steel Magnolias" and any Southern movie. So I wanted to do country music. Hey, y'all, it's Mickey Guyton here. I hope you guys are having an amazing CMA Fest. This is my first CMA Fest, and I'm so excited to be here. Hey guys, I'm Erica Grace Powell hangin' out at CMA Fest. One of my favorite girls in country music, Miss Mickey Guyton, is here with us today. How are you? I am so good. I'm just obsessed with you. Hey, y'all I'm Mickey Guyton, and I am so excited to be hosting the red carpet with the ACM Awards with Sounds Like Nashville. I jumped in blindly, but when I signed to Capitol Records, Mike Duncan did call me. He said that it's going to be really difficult for women. He didn't even mention people of color. And I was thinking, it can't be that bad. We'll be fine. I'll be fine. I've got a great label. I've got great management. Like this is going to happen. And then, reality sets in. I got questioned at every turn. It was like you've gotta make sure that you're really country, 'cause people are gonna think that you're disingenuous. And I'm thinking to myself, I grew up in Crawford, Texas. It doesn't get much countrier than that. I was signed because people loved my artistry. And it was like they tried to change everything and wash everything that made me me away and put this other person on top of me. There's this formula on how to make it in Nashville. I've followed the Nashville way for almost 10 years. It does not work for anybody unless you are a white, tall male. Like it is golden for you. You just follow that formula, you're gonna have like 10 number ones and a ranch and your own label and a bar on Broadway, like all of the things. Which is crazy, 'cause there's so many different people in the world, and you could be shutting off so many opportunities like that. It doesn't just have to be one way. I had went as far as I could go in my hometown, which is High Point, North Carolina. Please welcome Frankie Staton. I would just like to say that I wrote this song because at the heart of everybody, they wanna be loved for who they are. My wish for you all is that you find that in your life. I was playin' for the International Furniture Markets, which was the industry of our city. And I would play for people from all over the world. Every now and then I'd slip one of my own original songs in and they would say, "Did you really write that?" "Is that your music?" ♪ Oooh yeah ♪ And they would say, "You need to go somewhere where somebody can hear you." Being a Southern girl and having a love of all kinds of music and especially country music, I thought, I'll go to Nashville. I was always about the talent and the music and the creativity. So at that point I had already been around all kinds of people from everywhere, and they seemed to enjoy what I did. So I didn't look at it like, oh, I'm a black woman. Nashville taught me that I was a black woman. They made me know that. They made me know that my blackness made me different. I do pose a question a lot, just to get people to think, and it's who built Nashville? Like, who built this place? I mean, Nashville's a lot different than what it used to be when I was growin' up. But to me, this is home. There's very few of us left, original Nashvillians, kids that went to Metro, MMPS schools, and stuff like that. So to me, this is always gonna be home. If I close my eyes and think about it, the first thing I'm gonna see is Jefferson Street. You know what I'm sayin'? The first thing I'm gonna taste is the biscuits at Knock-Out Wings. My sister went to Fisk. I went to TSU right up the street. A big part of music growing up in Nashville was going to church, and the choir was so incredible. You would have these different musicians that were just world class musicians playin' gospel music. And at the time I didn't really have the same appreciation 'cause there wasn't nobody tryin' to listen to no gospel music for real like that. I'd rather be listening to Ludacris or somethin' like that, but, when I look going it, I realized how much of an impact it had on me and how much I value black music and black musicians in Nashville. Me and my father, we moved from Chattanooga to Johnson City, Tennessee back in 2006. My mother passed away when I was 17, and we pretty much, just, we needed to like start over, have a fresh start in a different place. I kinda felt this sense of in betweeness because I was a black girl growin' up in very conservative white suburbia, also dealing with like my gender and my sexuality. I was going to East Tennessee State University. I was looking through the catalog book and I came across this class called Bluegrass Guitar. And that's when I really started to understand my place musically and how I can contribute to music. And the fact that my ancestors were such a pivotal and important part of country and bluegrass. Like these are all things I had no idea of because, for me, I didn't know if I wanted to be part of a music community that, on the surface, didn't seem to recognize me as a valid participant because I was black. Country music is the music of the South. It is Southern musical tradition. And when you think about the American South, you gotta think about black people period. And all of these things that we hear that we associate with whiteness were absolutely being done and really being revolutionized really, like black people were really innovating in this space. There were times where whites and blacks would both learn music from each other. There was like a trade between the banjo and the fiddle, for instance. The banjo coming from West Africa. Adding that rhythmic playing, which we call claw hammer, you're playing melody and rhythm at the same time. So that going underneath these fiddle tunes created this new sound. We've got black string bands along with white string bands, but white people were put in this bucket where they create hillbilly music and black people are over here creating race records. The music itself is the same. The genres are really just marketing categories. How do we get music in the hands of these people? ♪ Warm wipe stomp ♪ And it really is the commercial music industry, this idea that now we're gonna make money off of this that starts to create that separation. Once more white people started learning how to play banjo, there was this thing that started happening in the early 20th century. The blackface minstrel shows. And people from all over the country would go and see these shows. That's how popular it was. When you're faced with being a black person during Segregation and trying to find opportunities to just have some sense of dignity in greater society. You are not gonna gravitate toward banjo or a fiddle because you're seeing yourself portrayed so negatively. Why would you wanna grab a banjo? If anything, it's let's create jazz, let's create blue. Let's create some other music now that we can have that's our own, because we can't touch this anymore. A lotta times, even as the music starts to shift, as we see more blues coming to the fore, they don't even want black people doing this other stuff anymore. They don't want the black string bands because that has been clearly defined as white music. So over time we lose the roots, which is that, yeah, white people were doin' it, but black people were doin' it, too. Every single bit of modern music, black roots music is foundational to every single bit of it. And just as black innovation, creativity is foundational to blues, it's just as much so to country. It's just as much so to folk, it's just as much so to any kind of pop music, any kind of, obviously jazz, obviously rock and roll. Like, there's no Elvis without Sister Rosetta Tharpe. There's no Hank Williams without Lead Belly. There's no, it's like, it's foundational. And that's the part that I started to realize. I don't need to apologize for being in any space. I belong here just as much as anybody. ♪ I don't pass the test of the paper bag ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ I picked the banjo up and they snare at me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ You better lock your doors when I walk by ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ You look me in my eyes but you don't see me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ Is you washed in the blood of your chattel ♪ ♪ 'Cause the lambs rotted away ♪ ♪ When they stop shippin' work horses ♪ ♪ They bet they own anyway ♪ ♪ Ooo ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black myself ♪ ♪ Black myself, black myself, black myself ♪ ♪ Black myself, black myself ♪ ♪ Black myself ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm black my ♪ ♪ Black my ♪ ♪ Black myself ♪ Country music is unique in that it is associated with a city, Nashville. And that's something you don't see in other genres. People come here, they have a certain idea of what Nashville is. They come with their cowboy hats and their fringe and their boots. And they think that that's how people live here and that it's a completely white city, when that has not been the case in reality. Bubble power. - No. - That was a huge one. Try not to shake it, though. I remember when I was probably like 12 or 13 the "Achy Breaky Heart." It was the music. It was the tune that caught me, and I've always cherished the song. So Billy Ray Cyrus, I was a fan of his, when I was younger. I'm not afraid to say that now, but I've always loved country music. I've barely scratched the surface, but I'm always in the mood to hear a good song. - Pop. - Oh, Oh, baba. How you feel about it? You took my song, but yeah, I was in, I think second or third grade when I heard "Achy Breaky Heart." I mean, I didn't know at the time that it was country, because of being so young, you really don't separate genres and everything. But, to this day, I do know that that twang and that guitar and the way that he was sayin' his words were definitely unforgettable, and that's country in a nutshell. I think country, for me personally, me being a black male, it doesn't really call out to me, I would say. It doesn't call out to me. It doesn't ask me to listen to it, per se, because I think that a lot of the years over time have been catered to another type of people. It's tough because country music, when it strikes the ear it don't sound like black music. You know what I'm saying? A lot of the iconography surrounding country music, it's not how we dress, it's not what we look like, it's not what we talk like. We didn't listen to country music growing up in my house. We was a jazz and gospel house. So it was just so strange, and it's like, everywhere you go you're inundated with a ton of country music, and there's no, there was nothing else playing. If you're goin' to the gas station, country music; you go to the mall, country music; you go to a store, country music. Everywhere you go it was country music everywhere. If you look at the scholarship on country music, it's very well established how country became white. But my question was really, okay, we know how it became white, but how has that whiteness been maintained? Because here we are 100 years later, and we still think of country music as white, probably even more white than we did 100 years ago. Historically the country music industry has really capitalized on finding a base audience of white conservatives. And that is a pocket of consumers that doesn't exist across the board elsewhere. By the late 1970s, as a nation, the U.S. really took a conservative turn. The cowboy came back in fashion. And this was coupled with Ronald Reagan assuming the presidency in 1980, and he sold himself as a cowboy. And in turn, the country music industry, and the CMA in particular, really leaned into those associations. And I don't know about our opponents, but there's an old Country and Western song called "Home on the Range," where seldom is heard a discouragin' word. I guess they haven't campaigned there yet. You could invite them here. If you don't, that's just as well. But they probably couldn't, they couldn't perform here anyway, because all they do is sing the blues. By the 1990s, country music was the most popular format on radio. And of course it all funnels back to radio, because radio is the most influential force within the country music business. It's across the board, within the country music industry for the past several decades where every pocket of the industry is invested in a certain type of listener. It's building on generations and generations of only selling country music as a product by and for white people. Part of the big reason why country music is the way it is, is because of the fan, the culture around it. Controversy over the Confederate flag hits home here in Connecticut. You cultivate whiteness for a very long time, you're gonna get a certain demographic of people. I think individual freedoms, you don't wanna tramp on that. Don't tread on me. There's no denying the tying in of Southern heritage to what traditional country music has been. I was a day-to-day manager for a couple country artists for about nine years. I mean, I remember goin' to concerts. You pull in the parking lot and you see all the Confederate flags, and those people might not be actively racist, but they're at a country music show, and they feel like that means that they should fly the Confederate flag. If you're not workin' in the music industry or you don't have a real reason to be there, you're only gonna put yourself through that experience once. I think all of it together has just sort of made this not so welcoming space for black people. And so I think that's why it hurts even more, 'cause it's hard to see this thing that you love and work so hard for, it's hard to feel like it doesn't love you back. Even as it sits in the heart of this very diverse city, the city that is a third black, this city with this rich civil rights history, Where the freedom riots started. Where you've got Alexander Looby's house is bombed because of the work he's doing to desegregate schools to fight for civil rights for black people. Where there are four HBCUs in town. There has been this constant shift away from or avoidance of or just really clear lines between this industry and the black community that's here. I am a lifelong resident, 69 years here in Nashville. I grew up listening to country music. My mother was a choreographer, so she always listened to music, and having grown up basically on a big farm and going to hoedowns and square dancing, I still have the silver dollars that I won in the square dancing contest when I was a little boy. So, country music, two step, square dancing, it's what I've done all my life. I was born in 1952. Of course, it was a different Nashville. My first time going to the Grand Ole Opry, I had to sit up in the top because it was segregated. So I never felt that country music was welcoming me. And so if I didn't feel it was welcoming me, and I've been loving it all my life, then I can only imagine how people who don't have any connection or people who even were trying to get in the business would feel, because they weren't there. So it caused me to dig a little deeper, to try to get a better understanding. And the fact is that, as Nashville was not welcoming back in the day, country music wasn't either. When I moved here, it was 1981, and it was quite different than now. There were tour buses everywhere. Busloads of people would come into these different clubs or restaurants, and they would have these jam sessions, and everybody wanted to get up and have a picture made singing on a stage in Nashville. There was one particular jam session I was interested in, was in the Captain's Table. I studied the marquee and it said Sammy Davis Jr. had performed there, and I love Sammy Davis, Jr. And so I said, I'm gonna be clean when I walk up in there. So I come down Church Street one night in my evening gown with my little fake rhinestones on, and the cops stopped me and said, "Where you goin'?" I said, "I'm going to the jam session" "at the Captain's Table." And he said, "To do what?" I said, "I'm singin' Loretta Lynn." He said, "Oh, really?" "I'm going with you." I said, "You wanna hear it?" "Come on." So my entree into the jam session was with the police. And I was the first one there. I signed up at 11:30 at night. It started at midnight. And he just kinda hung around a few minutes and gave his card to the manager, said, "If you have any problems with her, let me know." I thought, why would they have any problems with me? I'm just here for the music. I was drinkin' black coffee. I was the first one to sign up. And busloads of people came and went, and they got all them up to sing. They wouldn't get me up, and I thought, I'm not leavin'. I'm staying. If we have to have a sunrise service here, I'm stayin' till the sun comes up. And so I just sat there, and 2:30 in the morning, they said, "You know, we don't know this woman, "but this is a jam session that's open to the public." "So we're gonna get her up to sing a song." "And her name is Frankie Stratton." I said, "My name is Frankie Staton." And I go up there and I say, "I'm doin' the 'Coal Miner's Daughter' in the key of D." And I turn around and tell the audience, and the place is still packed at 2:30 in the mornin', that I came to Nashville because of this movie, "The Coal Miner's Daughter." I love Loretta Lynn. And I start singin' this song, and people, I gotta standin' ovation. They said, "Well, sing another song." And I sang another song. And they said, "Well, sing another song." They came down and said, "Can you audition tomorrow night?" And I auditioned the next night. And the next night, my name was on the marquee. ♪ Where have you been ♪ ♪ What did you do ♪ ♪ Did you know I was here patiently waiting for you ♪ Sometimes you have to stay when you don't want to.

Charley. Welcome, thank you for coming. You know, Charley, I always wanted to get a chance to talk to you. When I was small my mom and dad were in the music business, and I just kinda grew up in it. But did you always wanna be a singer from the time you were a little boy? Or did you just kind of- - I've sang all my life, but I wanted to be a great baseball player. You didn't make it? No, just in the door. Got- - You made it in the music business anyway. I think you're the only man in country music that's got four gold albums. Is that right? Well, I don't know, but I have 'em, and I'm proud of 'em. He's got four gold albums. I think that's great. Yeah, Charley Pride, man. Charley Pride started it all. ♪ Tomorrow ♪ Charley Pride was the first black artist signed to a major country record label in 1965. And he became a huge star. Like this guy was not just, okay. He was a massive success. ♪ You stopped loving me ♪ And he just did his thing. He didn't let anything get in his way of bein' what he wanted to be, to be a country artist when there was no people of color doin' it. And you know, it's a strange thing on the radio, you just hear this voice, and I associate with voices, and you'd never think that there was a black man would be singing country. What happened the first time you walked out and was introduced at the country fair? Well, it was actually, Ben, it was in Detroit, Michigan, and I had 10 minutes on the show. I drove all the way from Montana, and I walked and I'm down in the shadows, and they said, "Ladies and gentlemen," "how about it now for RCAs Charley Pride?" It was like. Big applaud, and I come outta those lights up in the shadows. I mean, out of the shadows, up in those lights. And they said. They didn't stop applaudin'. They just like turned the volume down. Put on the gloves. No, the whisperers came up. I had this little spiel. I didn't have but 10 minutes. I had to have somethin' quick to loose 'em up. They're sittin' there goin'. I said, "Ladies and gentlemen", "I realize it's a little unique, "me comin' out here on a country music show" "wearin' this permanent tan." So I said, "I'm gonna do the three songs I have", "and then the ones I've been doin' all my life" "before I had my three, and I hope you enjoy it." And I hit it. And when I came off it was a three o'clock show and an eight o'clock show, I sang from that show until the next one at eight o'clock. ♪ My whole life for this ♪ ♪ Few acres on the outside of town ♪ ♪ I've always pictured this moment ♪ ♪ This mornin' they're gonna start breakin' ground ♪ ♪ If this is gonna be ♪ ♪ Where we're gonna be ♪ ♪ Let me drop down to my knees right now ♪ Charley Pride, man, it's still crazy gettin' to say that he was a friend. The last two and a half years we talked on the phone every other Sunday for an hour or two. And he told me a lot about how to handle yourself in certain situations, to where you handle yourself with grace. But at the same time, you don't shy away from issues that you need to address. ♪ Turn this house into a home sweet home ♪ ♪ Paint some memories on these walls ♪ ♪ And keep this family together ♪ ♪ Forever and ever I know ♪ ♪ The prayer it works ♪ ♪ So God bless this day ♪ I feel like Charley did his part. Charley came into the genre in a time when they were still hangin' and hosin' black peoples in the streets, in the 60s and 70s. And he was there. He was there for a long time at a high level. He showed that it could be done. ♪ And prayer it works yeah ♪ ♪ So God bless this day ♪ We've seen throughout history that representation in and of itself is not enough, or Charley Pride would have fixed everything. There have always been moments where you see this kind of push of black artists trying to get in, but then ultimately being shut out. Charley Pride becomes this massive success. Of course other black people think that this is my opportunity, but the walls came down pretty quickly because there could only be one. Everyone told us to go to Charley Pride. Oh, you wanna get a break in country music? Go to Charley Pride. And I never could understand why they did that. But basically it was to get us out of their face. You're black in the country, oh go find Charley Pride. Well, why, did he have they label? Was he lookin' for talent? No. You're the label. It solidified the powers that be the ability to say, "We're not prejudice." "We have a Charley Pride." "We have a black man in country music." Now I'm gonna quote Dr. Cleve Francis on this. He said, "What 30 some million black people" "shook the country music tree "and one brother fell out in 75 years" "when I know there were many more trying." I'm a member of a oratorical people. We tell stories from the beginning through song, through poem, and I think our story's gotta be honored. It's kinda hard to find country music from black artists in Nashville that are from Nashville, that are really, that are really reflecting who we are. And I feel like if there was more that it would totally change my perspective of the music. Our story's gotta be honored, and it's gotta be held, held with the degree of authenticity and respect in order for it to resonate with the people. Places like these are important, because this is really where we start to see the music merged together, black musicians, white musicians, like you see a lotta old pictures where you got guys that are playin' the banjo, black musicians, they're doing it in these settings. They're entertaining white crowds. These settings are so indicative of what is happening in country music, what has been happening country music, because we're standing on a place of stolen labor. We look at the industry now that is birthed out of these black genres, these black musical traditions, and it's really stolen from our people, because they don't get to participate in the wealth that's being built here now. And you can't separate the industry that comes out of this place without talking about the ugliness of this place. I had always been apologizing, almost, for being in these spaces, where I was always the one black person in these very white... And people like, "Why aren't you singin' jazz?" I was constantly being asked to explain myself, "Why are you doing this?" "Why are you doing this music." First and foremost, music is about how it makes you feel, regardless of what you look like or where you grew up. For me as a kid, I really struggled with feeling in between. I'm either not white, I'm not black enough. I'm in the middle of all of this, tryin' to figure out who I am, and when I discovered this history and this music, that's when I was like, this is what makes me an American. ♪ Quasheba, Quasheba ♪ ♪ You're free now, you're free now ♪ ♪ How does your spirit fly ♪ I've had very academic discussions about the transatlantic slave trade. You can't just sit down and just start talking about that with people, because we're still healing from it. Black people and white people are still healing from this. A song and music has this way of disarming people. It takes a story or an idea and makes it to where the person kinda has to hear it. ♪ Blood of your blood ♪ ♪ Bone of your bone ♪ ♪ By the grace of your strength we have life ♪ I believe that's how we break these cycles of bigotry and violence. ♪ From the Golden Coast of Ghana ♪ ♪ To the bondage of Grenada ♪ We can't do any of it, if we can't face that they're happening.

Arguably. We have never seen a song in the internet era this big. And it's not just that the song is big. It's big and it's controversial. And let me tell you right now, it's a country song, so make some noise right now. It wasn't controversial to me. I was like, that's dope. But I'm saying it was controversial to some people. Let's make some noise right now for Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. He made like this one beat, and it was like, I used it on a song, and the song blew up. You know how it goes. What was the name of it? 2019 Officially belongs to Lil Nas X. That song became the longest running number one single in Billboards history. - I like Nas X, though. - That song, that song. He came out with a good song. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He caught it at the beginning. He wasn't even around country music. So he had to prove himself who he really was so he can be respected out here as a person. What he did was such a shock to the world, and to the country music world, especially once he came out, and then it was like, okay, so we have this young gay black dude, and he's got Billy Ray on the song. I mean, the impact was huge. Song went freakin' diamond. You know what I'm sayin'? It opened people's eyes and ears up that we can do it all. We can do whatever, it's no limitations. Especially when it comes to creativity. Like, it's none. And with "Old Town Road," it definitely opened up, like I said, people's eyes and ears to be like, oh, there's black people doin' this? As a kid growing up, what that role model that we talkin' about- A lotta kids are listenin' to that song. Yeah, yeah, so you know you need some positive role model around to hear something positive to say, "Hey, I can do that." Lil Nas X "Old Town Road." And a couple days ago it just reached number one. The song made Billboard chart history. It's the only song to simultaneously appear on the Hot 100, the Hot R&B Hip Hop Songs Chart, and the Hot Country Songs Chart. But now Billboard has pulled it from the country songs chart because they no longer believe that the song is country enough. People were mad. People were mad, and I'm like, I was just watching it, and I'm like, I wonder what they're gonna do. Are they gonna boycott him? So I was just really fascinated by it. I followed the whole thing. And then when I saw kind of how it started to resolve itself and people were like, "Well, why can't he do it?" Obviously that song was massive. And then he dropped some more music that was not like that at all. And I was like, wait, but people like this. I was like, people like that. Then I was like, okay, well, why can't I do it? There's no genre that sounds today like it sounded 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. As we've seen in country music throughout the years, as the sonics have changed, there is this constant borrowing from other genres, from other sounds. There is borrowing from gospel, from black gospel. There's borrowing from black R&B. Now we're in this era where there's a lot of borrowing from hip hop. It all evolves, and that creates more of an opportunity to bring in people from outside of this, particularly when the artist that is doing this genre blending looks like a Breland or a Blanco Brown. Lil Nas had to take some Ls as a young black man in this space, and I don't blame him for not wanting to stay in this space. However, by him doing that, he made it easier for me to do what I'm doing. ♪ Scuff these Jordans ♪ ♪ You can say you hate me ♪ ♪ You can call me crazy ♪ ♪ But don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ I put it out in September of '19, and randomly in December someone hit me up and was like, "Yo, your song is on TikTok." And I went and checked, and I was like, every minute there was new videos being made. It put up like 200 videos in like a day. And I was like 200 people made videos to it? And then I went and checked the numbers, and we were at like 30,000 streams. And I was like, oh, we just spiked crazy. I was like, this is dope. And then every day after that, it was just like going more and more and more. And about a week after that, I started getting calls from labels, and they were like, they're like, "Hey, you're an artist?" "You're Breland the artist?" And I was like, "I guess so." And they're like, "We wanna meet with you." And I'm like, the first couple calls that I got, I was like, all right, sure. But then I got calls from like 15 different major labels in a 24-hour span. And I was like, oh, this is for real, for real. Your song, "My Truck," was very popular. So popular, in fact, that I have a surprise for you. So on behalf of Bad Realm Records- - Oh y'all, oh no. No, oh no. So wait, on behalf of Bad Realm Records and Atlantic Records, we wanna present you with a platinum certification- - Don't do me like that, Kelly. For selling one million copies of "My Truck," which is hard to do right now, y'all. That's incredible.

It's never been a question, like, what do I wanna do? What will my career be? I've always just been like, I'm going to make history. I'm going to be a singer, and I'm going to do what I love. When people ask me why did I choose country music, I just tell them country music chose me. That's how I feel. I've only been in Nashville for two or three years. They haven't seen a lot of black women or black men in the country space. And so, because of that, they don't know what to expect from me. I feel like especially being in country music I kinda have to be aware of everything that I do, but I'm just like, I'm gonna be me. And for me, I'm like, I wanna be as extra as possible. Like that's just me. Oh yeah, I'll do freestylin'. Country music was so simple to me, and it told stories. You didn't have to create a facade. You just could tell whatever story you wanted. And I just, I gravitated towards it. You gotta create your own path and go for your own glory. So, couldn't nobody tell me what I couldn't do. I was gonna keep on doin' it either way it go. If it didn't work, I'm great with listening to myself goin' down the highway. In 2018, I realized I would never fit the mold. I stopped asking myself if something was good enough or radio enough, commercial enough. I started asking, is this me? Is this who I am? Is this what I wanna do? Am I communicating my heart? And that for me was the most freeing thing that could have ever happened to me artistically. Whenever you are makin' music, and in particular, if you have dreads and you're black, then people automatically assume things, like I'll be walkin' through the airport in some random city and people be like, "Oh, I love your hair. "Oh, you have a guitar." "Are you gonna do reggae?" And I'm like, "Oh, I love reggae, but no I'm not." Makin' life easier would be conforming to what people would see me do physically. But I do what I do. I do what my heart tells me. And I sound like I sound. And I don't feel like I wanna spend my time explaining all that. ♪ Mmmm ♪ ♪ Mmmm ♪ You know, they say, country music is three cords and the truth. So, I'm just sayin' my truth.

You could be where the air is clean. So it's deep in my heart, and say, listen, we can enjoy this dream. We can enjoy this life. And you can make music in these environments, about these environments. And you can just sit and write a song and sing a song with nothing, like with no electricity, sit outside and be like, I don't need anything. I could sit here and I could write a hit song.

There's a different way that soul comes out. The experiences of being black in America, that puts something in your soul deep down to where you sing the song a little different. I do think that there is a shift. There's a shift in consciousness that has occurred. Starting with the lockdown, all of the abuses that have always gone on that continued to go on, but which were filmed and absorbed in people's psyches and their emotions in a deeper way than ever before in my lifetime. Nashville is a part of a whole macrocosm that I think there is a wave of change happening in a sustained way that I have not witnessed in my life. That truth earned Mickey Guyton her first ever Grammy nomination for her deeply personal song, "Black Like Me," making Mickey the first black female solo artist ever to earn a nod in a country music category. Now you are headin' into the weekend with a trophy already in your hand, of course, that is for New Male Artist of the Year. You are the first black musician to do that. This weekend Mickey Guyton will become the first black woman to co-host the Academy of Country Music Awards. She was the only black woman to be nominated for an award this year. But as Amna Nawaz reports, a number of black women are starting to gain traction in the genre. When I started meeting Reyna Roberts and Kären McCormick and Camille Parker and Mickey Guyton, I just started feelin' like, oh, this is a thing. This is happening. It's not just me. There is a shift happening. There is a whole new sound comin', and it's not to take place of something else. We just wanna join the story. No matter how many different ways I sang, mo matter what makeup you put on me, I'm still a black woman. And that's never going to change. And I have to be who I am and love that and accept that. And when I got to that place, it was, it almost makes me teary eyed to even talk about, but it was truly one of the most freeing things I could have ever done for myself. There's so many amazing things happening for me, but there is so much sadness because I do know too much. I know entirely too much. ♪ My daddy work day and night ♪ ♪ For an old house and a used car ♪ ♪ Just to live that good life ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ It shouldn't be twice as hard ♪ ♪ Oh now ♪ ♪ Now I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed ♪ ♪ It's a hard life ♪ ♪ On Easy Street ♪ ♪ Just white painted picket fences far as you can see ♪ ♪ If you think we live in the land of the free ♪ ♪ You should try be a black like me ♪ I've been in town for years, and it took a song like "Black Like Me" and a man dying for people to notice me. How do you celebrate that? There are times, even to this day, where I still question if I have a home within the country music genre. And I just have to be honest. I don't always feel like I have a home, But I'm creating a home. And I hope I'm creating a space for other people of color and black people to feel like they have a home in this genre. It's gonna be difficult to have conversations about what we need to do or whether there's actual hope and movement right now when it ain't been this lit in Nashville in a minute. All these articles and that hasn't happened in a while. So if you're a part of that, if you're ridin' that wave, everything's too good right now. It's almost come every generation, right? Where been these moments in time when commercially speaking there was potential there to maybe be hopeful that something was gonna change within the industry. It's a business. And it's a business that does very, very well for itself, which makes me cynical because, from their perspective as a business where the goal is to make money, not to do the right thing, there really isn't an incentive to change. We're doin' a lotta talking and a lotta discussing, which is great, and which is a wonderful first step. But I have yet to see a lot of action against racism. We're seeing kinda surface level things. Some organizations in town that as they cultivate the list of who's next, they're making sure there's black faces on there. The CMAs and the ACMs they're, okay, we don't wanna have another award show where there are no black people. That is happening. But there's no consequences. There's not a lot of action of people saying we are not going to do this anymore. There's a lot of dismantling that needs to be done. I think if one artist says, "I don't want Confederate flags at my show," and that rule is followed, it can't even be expressed what a difference that will make moving forward. Nashville is growing, and Nashville is getting better, but I have not seen that same growth in the country music industry. And I'm startin' to see it now, but it makes me wonder is it cause of what's going on in our society right now? Or is it because they finally get it and understand that the country music industry will be better if it becomes more diverse? It's gonna take a lot to change country music. It's gotta be people behind the scenes, people at record labels, people in radio. It's gonna take a lot to change and it's gonna take time. We need to own the infrastructure, and we need to have black executives and black business owners when it comes to the music business. I think that's what changes it. It's not just opportunity, because opportunity just gives you the chance to operate within the parameters that's already set before you walk in the door, but power gives you the opportunity to do something pure. If we could change that, if we could hold power, I think that's the key. It's cool to be able to be in a position to where I can help other artists, because I wouldn't be here without people helpin' me. I feel like if I, as a black man, had kind of pushed through in this industry because people believed in me, only signed white artists, I don't feel like that's why I was placed here. And I feel like if I see other people of color that are strugglin' but talented, I feel like it's my job to help 'em. We literally all have to be having this conversation with each other. Like, hey, did you do everything that you could today or this week or this month or this year to help make this space more equitable, more fair for everybody? Did you do your part? It means very little to me to win a CMA, a Grammy, a Billboard Award, have a number one, or any of that, if I'm not able to do anything for the people who are also trying to do that. How can we help black people win in this space? And how can we help everyone else who's already been in this space and has benefited from those systems, how can we help them understand what's happening here, and so that they can also be a part of it? And I think if we're able to accomplish both of those things, then we can achieve real inclusivity and real equity. There has to be not just one or two or three black people that go on to have successful careers every 25 years or something like that. There has to be several black country artists that have viable careers. And we have to walk through that door together as a whole, as a unit, arm-in-arm, through these doors, and saying, "Hey, we're here and we're talented." "And we deserve to be here." "Our dreams are valid." There's no pushing the tide back. There's no turning the river the other way. It's that long arc of justice. It's long and slow and we're not there yet, but I do hope and believe that we will get there. It's a very exciting time for Nashville. And I have great hopes for this city. I've been here 40 years, seen a lotta changes. I have a lotta hope for this generation, which has certainly went further than anyone I've seen, other than Charley Pride. So I would say, learn how to work together, because there is such power in numbers. Learn to write together, exchange ideas together, develop your sounds together, support each other. Help the platform. Where can you go if you don't have a platform? That's what I would love to see happen in Nashville. And I think if it's powerful enough, a whole lot of things could happen. ♪ You can drink my liquor ♪ ♪ You can call my lady ♪ ♪ You can take my money ♪ ♪ You can smoke my blunt ♪ ♪ Scuff these Jordans ♪ ♪ You can say you hate me ♪ ♪ You can call me crazy, but ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt, skrrt ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Brrp, truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Woo-oo ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my ♪ ♪ V8 engine with the windows tinted ♪ ♪ Boy, we came from the bottom ♪ ♪ Got it out the mud ♪ ♪ Whole block jumpin' 'cause the subs stay hittin' ♪ ♪ If they roll up on me, know I keep one tucked ♪ ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ Woo ♪ ♪ Tell them boys come and get me ♪ ♪ I be ridin' through the city ♪ ♪ Young, rich and I'm pretty ♪ ♪ Homie, don't get it twisted ♪ ♪ Keep a semi in the hemi ♪ ♪ Red cup full of Henny ♪ ♪ My hitters come in plenties, for real ♪ ♪ You can drink my liquor ♪ ♪ You can call my lady ♪ ♪ You can take my money ♪ ♪ You can smoke my blunt ♪ ♪ Scuff these Jordans ♪ ♪ You can say you hate me ♪ ♪ You can call me crazy, but ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt, skrrt ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Brrp, truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Woo-oo ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my ♪ ♪ Wood grain dash with the matte black finish ♪ ♪ And it match my shawty with the big ol' butt ♪ ♪ Tell them boys come and get me ♪ ♪ I be ridin' through the city ♪ ♪ Young, rich and I'm pretty ♪ ♪ Homie, don't get it twisted ♪ ♪ Keep a semi in the hemi ♪ ♪ Red cup full of Henny ♪ ♪ My hitters come in plenties, for real ♪ ♪ You can drink my liquor ♪ ♪ You can call my lady ♪ ♪ You can take my money ♪ ♪ You can smoke my blunt ♪ ♪ Scuff these Jordans ♪ ♪ You can say you hate me ♪ ♪ You can call me crazy, but ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Skrrt ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪ ♪ Don't touch my truck ♪
