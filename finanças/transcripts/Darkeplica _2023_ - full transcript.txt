Mm mm mm mm mm Mm mm mm mm mm Good morning. What's this about? What do you mean? You left this on the pillow right next to my head. No, I didn't. Why on earth would I do such a thing? Penelope. Who you think else would have done it? I don't know. Things just happen sometimes. A ghost didn't put this by my head to kill me. I could've poke my eye right out my socket waking up blind woman! I told you I didn't do it. How you suppose it got there, huh? I don't know. Maybe some ghost did it, putting it there to warn you. The creeper is you. I done seen you lurk around these halls. Like uh little phantom I tell ya. Don't be silly. The truth is being told to you. Alright, now you up in the darkness, up in the midnight hour. And now it looks like you trying to kill me in my sleep! Don't be silly. Ain't nothing silly about me woman. You need some help! I don't remember doing anything. I truly don't. That's the problem. Now, Hailey Lynn could have gotten hurt. Then what? You know good and well, I would never hurt my kids. Not intentionally. But what if you did? What if that knife was in her room and not ours? You're right. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm sure they got some kind of treatment for sleepwalking. You know. Who is they? They-The doctors. Maybe some kind of underlying illness that we just don't know about. Doctors. Do you really think I need help like that? Can't hurt, can it? I don't think so. It's not that serious. The evaluation wouldn't take longer than a couple days. A few at the most. Valuation! What kind of doctor are you talking about! The kind that'll help get your mind right! You want me to admit myself? I'm not crazy, Jasper. I didn't say you were alright. It's just to find out what's wrong. Don't you wanna know what's wrong with you? Maybe I don't. I'm happy the way I am. I really. I believe so. You don't sound too sure about that. Now listen here honey. It's... It's nothing for you to worry your pretty self about, alright. I'm telling you, I'll come back for you. I'm not comfortable talking about this. Are you trying to get rid of me? Oh, don't be silly, alright? I just I think it'll do some good. By signing my rights away. Being at the mercy of someone else? I don't think so. I don't like this, not one bit! Everything will be fine. Alright. I promise you. That doesn't make me feel any better. Penelope, everything's going to be okay. I swear it. Now I'm not the kind of fellow that'll lie to you. Here... Here... It's delicious ain't it. ♪ Mmmmm ♪ How you doing honey? What are you doing here? Here to bring you home. They didn't tell me I was leaving today. I wanted to surprise you. They won't let me leave here. They say I have to stay in my room. Naw, naw, honey you can come home with me t-today, right now. Home. This is my home. This is my bed. This is my clothes. You better leave before they see you. You don't belong here. I don't want to get in trouble. They do bad things to you when you're bad here. Honey, do you know who I am? You don't have a white coat on. I'm not sure. It's so hard for me to think. Think, Think, Think, Think, Think. Here-don't, don't you worry none. Just... Can you see me now Penny? I'm brought you these clothes so you can, you know, look real nice like. Me-me help you get undress. Don't touch me. Don't you touch me. Leave me alone. Get out of my room. I Just... Get out! Sorry, I didn't... Trying to hurt you none. I just... Ok, I'ma...

I'm cute, too. Go ahead Mom, have some cake. Hey, it's time to celebrate y'all. Mama's home! Hey Mom! I'm really glad you're home. Me too son, me too. We need us some music up in here. I wanna dance me a jig. Come on baby dance with me. Come on, dance with me. ♪ Welcome to the meat grinder to judge you... we're brains in the sky. ♪ Everybody seemed to have a real good time last night. Oh, did you see the twinkle in Hailey's eyes when she saw you? Oh, that's a sight for sore eyes. I tell you. I want a divorce. ♪ You are the object We are the subject. ♪ Say what now? I just bought you home so we could be a family again. What-what's going on here? I want you to leave. Naw, naw! This can't be happening, can it? It is. This ain't, this ain't right. Don't, don't do me like this darling. And I mean, come on. That was supposed to be a happy occasion and... Just what's going on. And tell me the truth. I just don't need you in my life anymore. Don't do this to me. Not to us. Hailey Lynn just got her mama back. And now you want her daddy to go away? Maybe you just, you just tired, you know a little overwhelmed a bit, that's all. She's not your daughter. She is to me. And I love you, honey. Love has nothing to do with it! The heck it don't! It's got everything to do with it once I put that ring on your finger! I'm sure you can understand why you're a smart guy. Yeah, I'm wise as an owl too! You still blaming me for them kids going missing ain't cha? Where are the kids? Uh... Yeah! I got to tell you something. What! I'm making their favorite peanut butter sandwiches. Yeah. Where are the kids. Abo-about that, um. They've gone, honey. Gone where? What did you do to them? Not nothing. Not a thing, I swear. Where are my kids, Jasper? I'm so sorry, baby. There was nothing I could do. What are you saying? Zoey and Paige they are- They're gone. The woods took my munchkins away and they... And they ain't coming back. See, I knew you would figure it out. You didn't watch them. You knew they shouldn't go in those woods, And you left them alone anyways. So tell me what were you doing in a psych ward? Counting down the days until you'd come and get me. Those days turned into months, even years that never seemed to end. You done gone and turned into a heifer on me, huh? Because the way I see it, you've been waiting and planning for a day such as this to strike this blow on me. You don't even know what a heifer is. That don't matter. Every–thing mat–ters! Did you do it? It sure looks that way, doesn't it? Ain't that about a blimp! I can't seem to apologize enough for you to get it. Ain't a darn thing I can do about that now, Penelope. I can't change the past. You're not sorry. You're pitiful! And I can't stand your presence near me. Not! Wait, hold on now. Don't say such a thing. Harmful words coming out your mouth, woman. I know. But I do. Okay, just he-hear me please, please hear me clearly now. I took my eyes off of them for one moment, and that's it. They were out here playing around and everything. I Just-I let them be. Why would you think they wouldn't go into those woods? They were kids, curious to know what was in there. I wasn't thinking. No, you weren't. Our little ones are gone, Jasper. Yeah, I know, I know. You know, I ain't wont harm to come to them kids. You left them alone. And I... I, went in there straight away after them. And... Everything just got silent on me. Complete silence swept the air. And they were gone with it. It's nothing I could do. Silent! I told you something was in there. And! Stop pretending, the darkness isn't real! You were there with me, Jasper. I know you felt it too. Why didn't you believe me? You don't think I feel guilty? I search for them kids. I searched for Zoe and Paige. I couldn't find them anywhere. They were gone without a trace. But you wanted me to forget about them. Why? Just what had to be done. It was my blood that ran through their veins. Not yours alone! I know you don't understand it. I know, but I tried to stop the darkness from attacking you. Really? Yeah, really! I was protecting you. Just stop! You didn't allow me a day to mourn for them. Not one! Ya just gotta let the dead lie. That darkness will creep up on ya and ya won't know it until it's too late. Now I'm letting you know it won't let you go. You had me... walk around as if they never existed. And like a fool, I did it to appease you! Who does that? Those were your children, too! You don't think I love my kids? I don't know, Jasper. How could you forget about them so quickly? I thought we were over this. In my subconscious. I walked in my sleep. I searched in the dark shadows for those ghosts. And you locked me up with the insane for it. You needed help. I needed comfort. Something you never gave. You like a zombie Roaming around in the darkness just disappearing in the midnight hours. What else was I supposed to do? Penelope you'd be gone for hours and sometimes days? Nobody even knew where you were. You were losing your raggedy mind up in this house. You left me there, and forgot about me. I didn't see or hear from you for years. Not 1 or 2 but 5 years! I just couldn't see you like that. Your light had dimmed. Like you were fading away on me. My children were my sunshine. My light... My life... You took that from me! And I needed- Needed time to refocus. You, you needed to be fixed. You needed to get a grip on life so your light could shine again. I couldn't do that for you. You took my family away from me. What did you think a piece of cake was supposed to make everything better. Make everything okay? Yeah, I sure did. I did. It's just the way it had to be. Have you full of happy thoughts. Let go of the pass Penelope. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. I will forget about the past. And all that garbage out of your mouth with it. I don't believe in divorce. I'm not interested in what you believe. How much more am I to take? What am I supposed to do? Forgive me as many times as it takes. I'm not a saint! This can't be fixed! I will never forgive you for this. Look ah here! I made a covenant with God, and this right here ain't something for you to be breaking. Don't bring God into this. Why not? I made a covenant with Him. You and I stood in front of God and we told him, till death do us part and you ain't dead yet. I will not divorce you women. For better or for worse. You remember that, don't you? I need my space. Take your things and leave. Head on onto the other property a little bit. I won't be gone long. I'll be back real soon, you know. So don't you get too comfortable living without me! Are you alright, sweetie? You don't see them mommy? See who? They're talking to me. I don't see anyone. What y'all falling behind like a couple of lost puppies for? Bring yourselves up here, I want to show you something. All of this... Is wealth... In the palm of your hands. Man, Uncle Jasper. I knew you had land, but... I'd know you had all this. Naw, this ain't even half of it. You know, one day I'm the big belly up floating around in that blue sky, watching over y'all. Don't say that. Awl it's true young fellow, it's true. Everybody ends up pushing up daisies at some point. My petals might be dropping sooner than later. But when that day comes, all this belong to y'all. All of it? That's right. Split between both of you. Hum. I don't know what to do with all this. Whatever you do, can't sell it. Alright. Keep this in the family. Hold on, hold on. Something ain't right here. I don't hear no birds chirping, no critters moving around. Alright don't move. Y'all just stay right here. Run! You ran out of there like a bat out of hell. I didn't think you had it in you to run like that. Ain't no time to be dilly-dallying around when it's time hightail out of dodge. You hear me? Yeah... Well, now that Caleb's not around. What was back there? I just know I am about to be the one getting snatched up just yet. Snatched up! By what? You need to mind your business. Alright now. Sometimes you need to know when to shut up. But Jasper, what's with the secrets. Secrets ain't meant to be told? So stop asking. So that's the best answer you got. That's the one I'm giving. Now I just saved your life back there boy, you better be grateful. Really? From running from a ghost. You ask too many questions. Look, what I see is somebody who has secrets. And I want to know what for. So what was back there in those woods of yours. That's another question. I'm uh have a drink, you want a drink? Just what I need to quench my thirst. So are you going to answer my question? Do I look like somebody who would answer your question? You know I think it's time for you to leave. No! Not until I have answers. Oh, okay. Look who has grown themselves a pair of balls over the years. What do you think, you can challenge me, boy. You know you ain't so grown where I can put you in a grave, now. You know... I'm not a little kid anymore. Okay. So what you plan on doing? You better stand down, boy. Before you get yourself hurt. I'm the wrong one to be playing games with. Now that you quiet. Let me tell you something. If you pay attention to that forest, it'll speak to you. You know them critters in there they ain't silent for nothing. They usually the first ones to know something ain't right in there. Now if you don't pay attention to the signs before you go in there, you may not make it out alive. So is that what happened to my sisters? What do you mean by that boy? They just went into the woods. Never to be found again, didn't they? Yeah, that's right. All those little cubs left the field of Lillies... got stanched-up by that there forest. Never to be seen again. Jasper, how can you be so cavalier about it? I can't change the past boy. What is, is! And that's it. Yeah, but you sure can learn from it. I'd be a fool if I harped over something I couldn't change. And you know I ain't nobody's fool. I'm plumb tired now. It's time for you to be leaving. Gone get the stepping off my property, boy? What about Paige and Zoe? What about them? Isn't there more to the story? Look they gone... Alright, they ain't coming back. So you say. I'm going to find out what's in those woods of yours. One way or another! You a fool one way or another. Hey, Hailey. Are you okay? Where's Mom at? She's in the basement, washing clothes. Well I have to talk to her. Can I have some? You want some of this? You can have it. You say she's downstairs. Close your eyes... I want to show you something. You can open your eyes now. What am I supposed to see? You don't see them. Looks like your imaginary friend is only for you to see. I'm not pretending. You really see something? Why can't the bigger people see like I do? I don't know. They told me to tell you, they'll be talking to you soon too. They want to talk to me. Mom! Hayden's here. I wasn't expecting to see you here. What brings you here? What, I can't visit the best woman in the world to me. The hat. Thank you. Now you know you're always welcome here. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Listen, Ma. I wanted to talk to you about something. What is it? Oh! So we're serious. Okay. Yeah. Let's be serious. Um... Do you know what's in the woods of Jasper's property? Why are you asking me about that? You know something, don't you? Now, before you answer, don't lie. I can see it on your face. Don't go in those woods. It's not safe. Why? What's in there, Mom? Darkness. What do you mean, darkness, Ma? It's something you can feel... but can't touch. Smell... but not see. All I know is many have gone in there, but few have come out. Ma. That's rather bizarre. Are you sure? It's the only way I know how to explain it. The darkness moves in silence. We live in a day of uncertainty. We don't know when we will take our last breath. Why are you so serious? Because, I don't want to lose you too son! I've had enough heartbreak to last me a lifetime. I've had enough heartbreak to last me a lifetime. Ma, look, I'm not going anywhere. I know you Hayden. Once you've made up your mind, There no changing it. Look Ma. Whatever I'm going to do, I'll be sure to be careful. Okay. Don't let your feet lead you down a path of sorrow and dreaded end. Mom Tell me... Why are you so afraid of the woods? Because I was in there when it came. It chased me and Jasper out of there. I never went back in there. Nothing is moving. You thinks some spook is coming to get you. Come on. Don't worry your pretty little head about this here little silence. You know I'll protect you. I'll never let any harm come ta touch ya. It feels like the air is being sucked right out of my lungs. Honey, I, I don't feel nothing. How can you not feel this? Oh. Oh. Something dark is in here. And we are walking straight to it. It's getting hard for me to breathe. We have to leave. Something is here! We have to go now! Jasper and I would walk through there all the time. In fact, I loved it there. The beauty of it all intrigued me. Okay. And? There was a shift. The atmosphere changed. He thought I was losing my mind until he felt it too. But then want happened? You couldn't see it. Invisible things lurk in the forest. And it moves in silence. How do you know this? It's the only way I can explain it to you, son. The animals even know when it comes. They stay still, not making a sound. So... let me get this straight. Nobody went in to find Paige and Zoe, because of the invisible things in there? No. Bobby and Jasper searched. All I know is they were never seen again. My babies were gone. Ma. Don't cry. It's Okay. I just miss them so much. Yeah. Yeah, me too, me too. So, Ma. What's that about? I'm just keeping my house clean. From what? Spirits. Ma... Spirits! Are you okay? I'm just... trying to protect my little Hailey Lynn. Look, that sage ain't gonna do nothing but smell up your house. What makes you think something is after her anyway? I don't know! But she said something is here. Yeah. She said the same thing to me, too. I didn't really think anything of it though. So why are you? Let's just say, I'm paying attention. Listening to every sound. Looking at every movement. I can't help but wonder, what is in here. Hold on. So first you're telling me something is in the woods, and now something is in here. Mama, I don't really know what to think about all this. Why are you looking at me like that? You don't believe me, do you? I'm just listening. Taking it in as you speak to me. I'm not crazy for wanting to protect my family. Ma, I didn't say you were. Don't be so defensive. I will do whatever it takes to protect my family. To protect you. Ma, I just want to make sure that you're okay. Why wouldn't I be? I mean, the sage is a little extreme Ma. I just want to make sure that you're okay. I'm good. I, I just don't know what else to do. Are you scared? Maybe, just a little. So... you really think ghost are in here. Something is. Have you thought about... seeing a therapist again. No. So, you think I'm losing my mind? Hey, look, I'm just trying to help. It worked for you last time. Maybe it'll work again. I see. Do you know what they did to me, last time? -No. Maybe if you would've a came to visit me, then you would have known. I try many times, okay. They wouldn't let me see you. Jasper must have told them not to let me in. My hands were tied. No, mine was! I didn't know what else to do, but to wait till you came home. I'm sorry. Don't blame yourself. It's not your burden to carry. Yeah, but still. You were gone... And I hate that. And I hate him more for leaving you there. I just... I just wish that I could have done more. I see Jasper's trickery left me there, to be forgotten. Maybe it's best I didn't see you. I think it would have torn my heart apart to see you suffer and do nothing. Apparently nobody did. I was left alone in misery, fighting off demons. Maybe it was the meds, had you hallucinating. None of it was real. I saw those demons when I got there and they didn't leave. I was touched by a spirit. Spirit. Something invisible was in my room. I heard it speak to me. It had no face. No lips to speak. It spoke to me in the spirit. I was sleep. And I felt, the bed dipped, as if a body sunk down the mattress. Something... invisible was in my room. Are you telling me, ghosts came in your room. I'm going to recommend, that you do not tell Jasper. Okay. He might lock you up for good this time. I'm never going back to that place. Hailey! I'm about to go! Hailey... Hailey... Hailey! I'm scared, Mommy. Somethings in there. God please! Don't take my baby away! Please! Come back! Where did you go! Don't do this to me again. I' m... Please. Trying to protect you! Anybody see y'all out there? I don't know. Alright. Alright leave the doll with me! I'll take care of that. I don't want any trace of Hailey Lynn. Alright- Means we got to get rid of everything in this house. The only child you have is Hayden. I'll stay here awhile, until you get your mind right. It watched us. Looking at our every move... and waited till I wasn't paying attention. Who is they? The invisibles. Alright, I want you to go in the back room for a spell. Uhm. You need to rest that frazzled brain of yours. Yeah! Yes, it's a bit, a bit too much for you. I get it. Naw, yeah, naw I get it, I get it. You's a bit tired that's all honey. You get nothing. You weren't there. Rest isn't going to change what happened! Yeah. Yeah. I know it's a bit much to take in for a day. Um. But I'll take care of you. Don't, don't worry none. Go on. Go on. Everything will be alright. Gone now. This here has tipped the scale... to no return. It's alright, I'll make it right. Make it right- Make her as comfortable as possible. Tearing my heart to pieces. What you doing here girly? Bout made my heart skip a beat. I wanted to surprise you. Alright. Where... Where your mama at? She's outside. Gone pull-up a chair. You take that doll of yours everywhere you go, don't you? What kind of mother would I be if I left her behind? You gonna be a real good mama one day. I'm hungry. What's this here, your mama didn't feed you? I like your cooking. Oh. I want some squirrel. Oh, is that right. I suppose I can mustard up a little something. Put'em out there on, on the pit, and burn'em up real yummy. Yeah I'm getting me some grub. Look uh there. You done turned little country girl on me after all. Yep. Alright, well got to go out there in the back of the woods to fetch it. You coming? Nope, I don't like the woods. It's spooky in there. You ain't got to worry none. The trees might come alive and get me, and I won't be able to see you anymore. Okay. Well, If I'm gone... my wise old owl will take care of you. He's always watching with those big old eyes of his. Come on let's go fetch us some vittles. How do I tell Hayden his sister is gone missing. So much to figure out. So much to do. So how am I going to tell your boy, that his baby sister has vanished into thin air? That's the truth. Why do you act like he's not your son too? Why you changing the subject, huh? I didn't say he wasn't. Maybe it's the truth he won't believe. It's still the truth, Jasper. Why you keep staring out this window? Till my baby comes home. I really hate to break it to you like this, darling but... that little sweetness of heaven ain't coming back. How do you know this? Maybe the spirits in the sky took her cause... you forgot about your first love. Who are you talking about? You know, you worship that little girl. Maybe God took her away because... wanted you to focus on him. It's not fair. You crossing the line now, Penelope. You're wrong. It can't be true. Then how do you explain it, huh? A leprechaun didn't slide down a rainbow and take her away. Things don't just vanish into thin air, Penelope! You never believed me. You think I've been lying? Why else would you be acting this way? Think about it for a moment. I don't know who took her. For your sake... I hope it was God that snatched her up. Cause things can get real ugly if it ain't. What are you saying? You sound like you know more than you're telling. What I do know is that you better get on your knees and pray. Alright, It's not the first time people done gone missing. Do you remember what happened in the woods? I don't wanna remember. Our kids disappeared. I done told you now I don't want to talk about that. Something is in those woods, and you know it. You just don't know when to be quiet, do you? I know you felt it, too. I heard the growling, Jasper. The smell of sulfur. I can't forget it. The air was so dense, it was hard to breathe. It brought chills through my body, scaring me out of my boots. Why couldn't we see it? Just let it be, woman! I think the Invisibles are here. Let me tell you this much... God don't let anyone or anything come before him and you knew that. But you did it anyway. Now look what happened. Our Hailey Lynn is gone. Sometimes you need to know when to be quiet. I don't have the patience to be listening to this foolishness. How long... does my heart have to bleed? All you do... is pour salt on my wounds. Are you getting some kind of sick pleasure out of this? Look! You did this to yourself. Can you just shut up? I hate being in this dark place. It's time for you... to move on with your life now. Could you just stop talking? Well, if it ain't God that snatched them up. You better hope they don't come for you next. If not me, you. How many times do I have to say it. Thee invisibles took her. You know, I can't keep listening to this nonsense. Kid of yours is gone, and nothing could be done about it. Why don't you stop looking out this here window. Listen, I'll cook you up some vittles and... And I'um just head on back home. You're leaving me. It's time for you to... get your life back again. You know, I'm just holding you back. I'm crippling you with my presence here. No you're not. I need you. I'll still be loving you just from a distance, that's all. Oh, no, no, I... Please don't leave me, I, I, I can't function without... I can't function anymore. It's just. It's just for a time. Please don't, please don't leave please. Please. All this time, I'll come back and be with you just right now at the time. I need you here with me, Jasper. No, no, no, no, you don't. You need the man upstairs it's good for you to just have some time with him alone. Just you and him. This, this is what's, what's best for you. Alright. I can't keep holding ya. I can't believe you're... blaming me for this. Well! You better believe it. You know, sometimes the truth is a tough pill to swallow. You gotta just digest it and move on. That's all you have to say. I'll be praying for you. I'll be sending my prayers up to heaven for you. Hope you get better. It's the best I can do. Can't do no mo! Mommy! Hailey Lynn, is that you? Don't cry, Mommy. I love you. Come back. What you doing sneaking around my property for boy. You said all this will belong to me one day, didn't you? I ain't dead yet. Figured I'd come check it out. Yeah, alright. This here property is pretty wide and deep. I'd hate for anything bad to happened to you. Like what? Never you mind it. Hey uh. Who's grave you got dug up back there? It'll be one for you if you keep asking all them questions. Are you threatening me? Take it how you will, boy. Now, be no fool, don't be no fool. Don't do that. I will beat you dead with my bare hands right at my feet messing around with me; and you know I'll do it. Not if I get you first. You really trying me, huh? Now I warned you! Best turn around and be gone. I ain't saying it twice. Look, I didn't come here to shed blood with my dad. No, you didn't. You came here being nosey, trying to see the site list! Did I? What's with all this hatred built up in your soul for boy? I think you know the answer to that already. You need to just cut it out, alright. Cause all this right here is enough to wake the Seekers. Seekers? Jasper what the heck are Seekers? You just need to step cautiously, cause they know you're here. So there is something in here. Jasper is that what happened to my sisters? Hey! Mind your business. Use those legs of yours and get out of here for you end up as bait. Now gone get stepping off my property for you end up dead! Hey where you at darling. Oh, you got the door wide open. What you inviting all the heathens of the earth to come on in here? Did you shut it for me? Yeah, of course. You know, I don't uh smell the aroma of vittles cooking! I don't eat much lately. What, you living up in here starving ya self? It's nothing like that. Okay. I'm just not eating heavy food. I've been eating lite. Would you like an apple? I have plenty. Does it look like I'm on some kind of diet or something. It's suppertime. I'm gonna need something that's gone stick to my ribs. Where the meat and potatoes at? Not here. I'll go head on back home then. I uh... Now I was expecting to share a meal with you. I guess I'll see you another time then. Say what now? So just like that you're gonna kick me out yo house.

There's no cream or milk. Naw that's fine. Usually, typically it's 3 minutes. And then you take this and you go like this, you take this go like that; then after you do that you go like this. Oh, okay. Thanks. Why were you on the floor crying a river last night? What's going on in that pretty head of yours? I feel like I'm losing my mind. Something is in that house and I can't see it. I was in the bathroom and it tried to get in the room. Now that was just me at the door. No. I know what I saw. You in there sniffing bubbles? The fragrance got you, got you doped up with illusions. I'm telling you something mystical is happening in there. Maybe it's time for you to... get some help again. You promised... you would never put me away again. Oh, come on, you. Almost... Almost gotcha! Yeah. Yeah. This is he. No. I left her in your care. So what happens now? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Hey! I thought I find you here. Yeah. What's going on? Well... I went over to Mom's house, and there was no answer. So I sat... for hours. She never came home. Jasper. I'm getting kind of worried about her. You know, the last time we spoke. Well, let's just say it could have been better. I hate to break the news to you like this son, but. Your mama gone, and so is your sister. Gone! Gone where? Did they move without telling me or what? Angels in heaven called them home, son. What! No. No. What happened to them? Just calm yourself now. Just tell me. What happened? All I can tell you is that... She told me... She just vanished right before her eyes. She said some demon after her... took Hailey. She was gone. Never seen again. You believe that? Well, she believed it and she went crazy. Penelope lost her mind Hayden! Talking to ghosts, and such... White coats came and got her. And they took her away. What? Now all of a sudden, you can't understand my speech boy! The psych keepers. I had to put her away so she could collect some sense. Really! She was losing her raggedy mind up in that house. I had to do it now. I... I feel mighty guilty for what I did. I saw her and she was... bound up, chained like some darn dog. When did all this happen? It's uh, awhile back. About three months ago. You know, she's always been a tad touched in the noggin. Three months! Why didn't I know about this? I'm telling you now. Alright. She turned into a lonely tune on me. A plum D nutcase! She was talking to nobody and and listening to nothing. Now, I'm telling you, son. She had a couple of screws loose up in that head of hers. She went crazy right before my eyes. I didn't know what else to do. I tried calling you. You didn't answer your phone. So, let me get this straight. So after all this time, you didn't try to call again? I didn't have time to. I needed to get my mind right. Alright. You don't know what it's like over here. You just don't know. No. No. You had time. You just didn't choose to take it. You weren't here. You don't understand it all. It was so much going on. I mean, she said she was... hearing voices in her head. Hailey could see them. You say what now? She said something was in the house. Lord hold my hand tight, and calm my mind. Are you kidding me? All this trickery of my mind, it ain't right. Son, I'm telling you it ain't right. Do you hear me? Oh, I hear you. Are you listening to me? Cuckoo birds whistled a special tune just for her ears to hear. It's like she was talking to the ghost and... and listening to it. Tricks! Yeah, all the poof now you see me, now you don't. What was going on over there, huh? How she up and just disappear? I don't know. All that uh... dabbling in the spirits... stirring up spooks and stuff. I mean, I don't play that kind of games boy. No. It wasn't nothing like that. With my own two eyes, I saw her. Yeah! I saw her twirling rocks. And, and burning sage all over the house. Like a like a witch from hell. If it was a spirit she was talking to, she brought it there; conjuring up the unknown, boy! That's where you're wrong. She was scared, Jasper. Scared of what? She was burning it to make sure the spirits would go away. They were in the house. Jasper she was trying to protect Hailey. It's got my mind spinning boy! It's got my mind spinning. I mean she said that they were whispering in her ear. What kind of nonsense is that? Maybe they did. Maybe they did. Are you crazy? You been spending so much time with her that the crazies that latched onto you. How dare you. She was my mom. Yeah It sounds like a hereditary situation. I'm done. Now wait, now wait Hayden. Listen to me. Little girls... don't just go poof and vanish into nothing. I mean, you do know that, don't you? All I know... is that my whole family's dead. Son you're not alone. I'm still here. I ain't going nowhere. What good is that? You locked my mother up because she was full of grief. Are you kidding me! Just now calm yourself. That's not going to happen. I still love you. You're my blood. My only son. My only son. My mom... was scared... living in the house by herself alone. And nobody tried to call me. Nobody... tried to find me. Scared. So you and Jozetta just keeping your mom secrets, huh? Secrets. It was plain to see, man. You know what? It doesn't matter. Everybody's dead. What's really in the woods, Jasper. I know you know the truth. You just mind your business. Alright, just let it be. You still won't tell me. Why our kids being kidnapped. Hey, you let it be and just let the dead lie in peace! You know what, I'm done! What are you doing? Banging on my door like some fool. How'd you even know I was here anyway? I didn't. You weren't home so... I figured you was here. Look Jasper! Those things are real. Boy, I ain't in the mood for no riddles, now! What kind of sense of humor you got? What is your marbles rolling on the floor or what. Something is in the woods. Calm down now. What you out there doing on my property anyway. Those things in the woods. Say what now? You got some kind of... monster back there hiding in the woods. Just what did you see? It's not about what I saw. It's what I felt. See you being nosey, bout got you killed. You satisfied now? No! It like to bit you in the buttocks or ripped your head clean off. Didn't I tell you not to go out there. You know, you lucky you didn't get dragged away... disappearing into the darkness. What the heck is out there? Why can't you mind your business boy? Ain't it enough that it chased you out of there. Something invisible is out there. Invisible. So now, now you, you feeling invisible things. Does that make any sense to you? Does it? Stop pretending that you don't know what's going on. Okay, It's snatching up bodies and you know it. How many people must die before you confess? You need to hush up! Count your blessings. And don't go back out there. And if I do? Foolish people do foolish things. Are you a fool? No, I'm not. Okay. Okay. Alright. Well, you might not make it out there alive. Listen here.
