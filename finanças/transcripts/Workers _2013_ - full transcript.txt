Good day sir, welcome. May I help you? Can I show you anything special? Yes. Here they are, mister. You may try them on. They look good. They're the best quality available. Do you like them? Yes. Will you leave them on? No, they might get dirty. Do you have a special event tonight? Yes, well, tomorrow. Marriage? Baptism? Graduation? Your son getting married? I don't have kids. I had one, but he died. I'm very sorry. Are they for the funeral? No, it was thirty years ago. He was very little. He wasn't even three years old. They're for my retirement. I'm retiring tomorrow. How great! Doesn't it happen to you, some days you just want the day to end and tomorrow to come? It's the advantage of getting old, you retire and everything. Go figure, I still have a long way oh well, everything at its own time. No but, youth is a very beautiful thing. If I'm not being indiscreet, what do you work in? These Philips are really good. DO NOT STEP ON THE GRASS What? What are you looking at? It says "don't step on the grass", and yet, there you are. You can't read or what? Nor write? Why do you carry a pen then? In case anybody needs one. Are you serious? If you want, I can teach you how to read and write. Would you like that? Here... This, is letter A the first one of the alphabet. Buy yourself a notebook, and do an entire page of it. I'll meet you here tomorrow, same time. See you! Hello? Yes, a moment. Your son, madame. Mom? They're outside, madame. Mom? THALIA'S WEDDING PARALYZED MANHATTAN./i> How are you feeling madame? Shitty, Lidia. I would just like my Lord to take me with him. I'm only worried about Princesa. Don't say that. You'll get better, Madame. Don't wish me bad luck, Lidia! I don't feel like living anymore. This is not life. You're going for a walk, my love. You know already, Lidia, don't take her downtown, nor any ugly, or poor place. It's not Princesa's fault to be living in this shitty town. Fuck you, Tijuana. JUANA, I LOVE YOU JUANA, I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE Good day, Lidia. Hello. Turn off that musc, Severino. You know Princesa doesn't like it. You do like "banda" music, right Princesa? I've always liked that park Did you see it? Look at those clouds, so beautiful. How can you know whether she likes "banda" music or not, if she's never listened to it? Take us to the viewpoint, Severino, Madame asked me to take Princesa to see the sunset. Don't look at that, it's a dump, and it's very ugly. Don't look at it. Have you seen how Madame suffers because of her age? Ugly, right? I don't want you to suffer that way. That's why you'd better die young. As the Madame was already arriving and the boy wouldn't let me clean up, I gave him a toy for him to play outside so he could be entertained. Poor kid! He would be a man already. God makes horrible things, Lidia. Turn the heat on. Princesa, wouldn't you like to have a friend? Yes, a greyhound, or greyhoundess, who knows what they're called. That guy is after Elisa. She's very lonely, poor girl. I have never heard of a single boyfriend. As beautiful as she is. And the boy who sells oxygen? He's cool. His name is Eduardo What does he say to you? Nothing, he's always asking me out. So, what do you answer? He looks nice. Madame is very ill. I made coffee, want some? He was the neighbour, an american, friend of my parents. He came often... always brought me gifts, or sweets. Often they left me with him, I played with his kids. Have you ever thought of vengeance? I was 5 or 6 years old. I couldn't even understand what he was doing to me. I thought it was my fault. Because I told him we were a couple, and kissed him on the mouth. You were an innocent girl, kids don't know what they do. You didn't tell your parents? God forgive me, but the son of a bitch who does that to an infant, doesn't deserve to live. He died. I had to go to his funeral, because he was a great friend of the family... So, he's not around to harm you. He's still in my dreams. What was his name? Who? The guy who did that to you. I have to see Madame. You retire tomorrow? That's awesome. Many people get tattooed to remember a special occasion. Are these, about anything special? What are they? Memories. And the one in English, what does it say? I don't know. I got it from an american during the war. Which war were you in? Vietnam. You never talk about that. When I was a kid I loved buying ice-cream from that truck. They were really good. I found the truck to be big and beautiful. Now I see it's ugly and tiny as fuck. When you are a kid, everything is beautiful. Don't you like the Philips? The bulbs. Once, some guy came, to get tattooed, the word "God". The asshole didn't pay me and left. What an asshole. The region counts with many lakes and rivers. Nature reserves are very common in North America. However, many economic losses are derived from the waste of water in urban regions A leak of water or an open faucet may cause severe economic losses. So they announced a dog race and, we stayed to watch it. Before, they also raced dogs, that's why it's called greyhound track. They have always been dog racers, they still race dogs. My mother was really impressed by this bitch that didn't win but was trying so damn hard! She was in the last place, but never gave up. So, all those dogs are really skinny, because that's the way their breed is. That's why they're named greyhounds. But this one, was the skinniest and tiniest of the whole lot. Very funny. In the end, my mom said to me: Buy it. She was obsessed. So I went to see the owner and said, How much? He was an american asshole, who wouldn't sell the dog. But, I reached the amount. You showed him the gun? Fuck yeah. So, my mother took her, she fucking adored the dog! Was its name already Princesa? No, Princesa my ass. What was her name? Snowflake. Snowflake. But she said no way, she's my princess, so the name stuck. Mister Emilio, your mother has died. At 4:20 AM, Madame Juliana's existence ceased. My mother's last will was to not fire any of you and... Could you tell them, mister? In Madame's will it is said that none of the servants shall be fired. Each one of you will continue with your labor in the same way. The house shall be clean, ordered, as always. The pool, gardens, everything. Madame has written that the sole heir of everything, is Princesa. You will work for her from now on. You shall attend her, take her out for a walk, feed her at the right times. Bathe her also, just like before. So, you just keep working as before, as if my mom was still alive. You're not included in the will, because you're my employees, not mom's. But just in case, for security, you'll stay outside the house inside the van as always. All this is for Princesa not to be stressed, and so she won't miss my mother. They loved each other so much... In the will, it is also stated that if the dog named Princesa dies, you, the servants, will inherit Madame's fortune. Evidently, the dog has to die of natural causes. So, don't try to play smart. You have to wait for a moment, mister. You can go in. I'm listening, Rafael. I've been working here for 30 years, so I come for my retirement. What year did you begin working here? In 1969. I have your files here but... I don't have the exact date when you were hired. Thursday 4th of September of 1969, that day the subway in Mexico City was opened. Yes, but... if it isn't on the file, it's impossible to make the retirement arrangements. Okay... Let's look at the file. So... it says here that you are a model employee, punctual and efficent, that has never missed work a single day, has never taken vacations, and who loves his work. It also says here you... fought with honours in Vietnam. Patrol Chief, Têt Offensive, in 68. Where do you come from? El Salvador. Where is that? South America? Central America, sir. Ah yes, of course! Around Guatemala, right? Are you here legally? That complicates things, Rafael. Let me call Immigration, just to ask something. Miriam... - Don't call them, please. Rafael, why don't you have papers? I was only passing by, on the way to the United States. You couldn't get in? Yes, The Immigration Service offered naturalization if I went to fight in Vietnam. When we came back, they didn't do it. Why did you come back here? I had a woman and kid. The boy died when I was overseas. After that, we couldn't be together. Damn! Rafael, normally, I would call Immigration. But... I think I understand you. Let's see... Considering your years working for this business, your courage and efficacy, I won't inform the authorities about you illegally being here, in Mexico, and I will also let you continue working here. Miriam, a coffee. You can leave, Rafael. We attach ourselves so hard to beasts, isn't that right? Very good, Mrs Lidia, we'll take care of it. Stop that music, the dog is sleeping. You can't clean up these spots. It's tartar, Lidia. Every bathroom in this house is like this. Full of tartar and filth. My mother used caustic soda. Acid is better, very fast. Good morning, Princesa. What would Madame say? Is this car any good, Seve? This car is the best, Lidia. I have been driving it for almost 30 years, and it runs like new. They don't make cars like this anymore You talk as if it was yours! No, but you get attached to the cars, when you drive them often. Even if it's not yours. I have been driving cars for 30 years, and yet have never owned a single one. Wouldn't you like one? Of course. But this one, it's Princesa's. How much longer do you think this doggy will live? With the life she leads, she's going to bury every one of us! Madame was right, Tijuana is really ugly. Good afternoon, Fede. Hello, madame Lidia. You got acid? Yes, of course. Sulfuric, please. Make them two. Well, well, well, Mrs! Who would have thought. Damn right, we're in! So, well... you can have this money, for the annoyance. No, Mrs, please. You owe us a favour. Leave this cellphone there, with the GPS, we'll locate each other. Hello, Rafa! I didn't forget about you! So, the pages? Very good. Perfect. Good... Well, make a page of these, we'll meet here again. Alright? See you. You will live forever inside the hearts of your inconsolable parents and brothers. A memory of her parents and siblings I've seen this light turn on every single night for 35 years. I miss Madame. I can't sleep at night, waiting for it to turn on. I can't really believe it will never turn on again. Does it happen to you? Last night I dreamt I went back to my hometown. I haven't been there in so many yeas! I went away as a girl and never came back. In my dream it was as if, time hadn't passed. Everything was exactly as before: the houses, the streets, the plaza I was drinking coffee people passed by, kids playing. Dreams are really beautiful. The other day I dreamt I was in a restaurant, I ate like a pig, and left without paying. This dream, I've had it three times. Each time, I've perfected the get-away. And what else happened in your dream? Nothing more. I came back, that's all. I haven't been feeling well lately. A while ago, I asked Elista to take my pressure. The body is not what it used to be, don't you think? Yes, of course. I feel like, I want to make things, but my body won't respond. I feel young and full of energy but the body just won't give in. It's not the same. I feel old and tired. My life has passed me by and I never had anything. Always poor. That's what we talked about earlier. You are born poor and you die poor Funny that Princesa has got more money than us, and she doesn't even know! I love Princesa very much... but we have to kill her. If we're caught, we're screwed big time. But if we do it discreetly, little by little, and take the secret to the grave, we can re-do our lives. Kill her little by little? How is that, Lidia? Hey Rafa, did you do your homework? Ok, it's fine. Well I'll see you around, I'm in a hurry. Let's talk about the unstoppable spiral of violence that's hitting our Tijuana: a macabre discovery in the municipal cemetery, this morning, a vengeance without pity. Members of a cartel have profaned a tomb and dissolved the remains with acid. Incredible, José Luis! The victim of this hatred can't even be identified because the tombstone was erased, and they wrote "unborn" where the name was, which means, he never existed. That's right Isabel, it's as if this person wasn't ever on Earth. In other news, the president... These narcos, they don't deserve God's forgiveness He must have done something. Scenes of love in the border. Hey, are you Rafael? Muffin couldn't come, he's ill. He told me to come in his place. How is it going? Good? - Good. What are you learning now? Muffin only gave me the notebook. Things. What do you want to learn today? So you work in a bulb factory? Yes. Are these the same as the ones in houses? No, these are different. Why? They emit toxic gases. May I help you? I was looking for pink, a bit fuchsia. Look at that boy with tattoos, he looks awesome. I would love to get a tattoo, but I don't know exactly what. And if I do it now, Mom kills me! She says it's something for bums and when you get old they look wrinkly and ugly. Oh well, that's my mother. Nugget liked you a lot. Really cool guy. He's great at skateboard. Maybe one day he can teach us. Once, she threw me out because I said a bad word in front of the fucking dog! I swear! Do you remember? That was my mother! Thank you. Everybody has their money? Yes, they're already leaving. I'm leaving soon too. Just wanted to thank you for everything. On the contrary, Lidia, thank you! A whole life of looking after my mom. I'll always carry you in my heart... You and your Juanito, who was born and died in this house. You know what, Lidia, keep it. My mother loved that dog so much! After her death, Princesa seemed very ill. She was never the same dog. She dies just a year after my mother. I think she missed her and died out of sadness. You know how animals are. They are together now with the Lord. But it's a dog, Lidia. Animals don't go to heaven, or at least the same heaven, I think. Who knows? For better or worse... Cheers! We're leaving. Want a lift? Get in! And you, Elisita? I've called a taxi. See you. Lidia, goodbye! Take care of yourself. Write me. Okay, and you answer me. Be good, see you soon. Ciao! Alright, take care of yourself. You know I'm here, if you need me. Thank you. We'll write to each other, right? Of course! Thank you. You remember the guy from the cemetery? Yes, the narco, right? He wasn't a narco. Rafael Heredia, present yourself at management. Please, come in. Rafael Heredia... When was the last time you were here? Ten years ago. Do you remember the exact date? The 4th of September, 1999. Around those days, Oscar de la Hoya lost against Tito Trinidad. Do you know why you're here today, Rafael? Gentlemen... this has happened every single day for the last ten years. And it began the day Rafael came out of here, without his retirement. Every day, Rafael has been damaging, as insignificant as it may be. Nothing but a little sabotage, but, every single day. If we sum the damages it's millions in losses. You are a great enemy, Rafael. Rafael... with this you could be sent to prison but we would take time, and prestige, Meanwhile... Mr. Heredia, at your age, that would be fatal. So let me show you these documents we have prepared for you. Two checks, your retirement and an extra, because of our mistake. Hand this to Mr. Heredia. Ah, one last thing Mr. Heredia... You leave through the back door, and I never want to see you again. You go right now, not in 5 nor 10 minutes. You can't go get your stuff.
