Soyuzmultfilm / Moscow Rikki-Tikki-Tavi Paws together Head lower A leap! Another! Be more accurate Higher! Forward! To the right! Forward! To the left! Learn to fight, son! With your teeth With your claws By jumping And by pouncing You know, they say When a mongoose gets bitten by a snake He eats some herb Which supposedly cures him That is not true The victory of a mongoose over a cobra is a matter of quickness of eye and foot A cobra's bite against a mongoose's jump! This very jump is more wonderful Than any healing herb Rikki-tikki-tikk! Got any news, sister? Listen up, Chuchundra! There's a bunch today Did you see it yourself? Where? In the melon-beds? And also... A young mongoose has died Take a look Here he lies, the poor thing No, no! My heart is broken as it is And anyway I have always said When parents don't bother with their kids' upbringing kids drown in puddles A dead mongoose! Maybe he is still alive Try to warm him up Rikki-tikki-tikk! Rikki wants to become your friend Abu! He will bite him! No! Unless Abu tries to pick him up by his tail Let's give him some food Maybe he will like it here What happened? The mongoose has awakened! He isn't so stupid as to have drowned And I have always said When parents raise their kids right kids don't drown in puddles Hello! How are you feeling? I'm fine Do you live in this house? No, I live in the garden I'm Chua, the garden rat It's my sister who lives in the house I'll stay here And see everything for myself I won't let him live in the house! No Don't hinder their friendship What happened? Oh, a terrible misfortune! Our son fell out of the nest at night And Nag swallowed him That's so sad But I'm new here I'm not from these parts Who's Nag? You're asking who is Nag? Look and tremble! Because I am Nag Do you think If you have marks on your hood You have a right to eat fledglings? Let us talk, kid Don't you eat what suits your taste Then why can't I snack on a fledgling? Look behind you! Bite her, the white-toothed! Hurrah! Hurrah! I'll still get you! It's high time I remembered everything my father had taught me Attaboy, Rikki! You fought bravely! I only bit her! Rikki-Tikki! Where have you been the whole day? What's wrong with him? He's been running all day and got tired No Something is worrying him Who's there? It's me, Chuchundra Oh, don't hurt me, Rikki-Tikki! Would he who fights snakes Bother with a musk-rat? I'm so miserable! I am even too afraid To run to the middle of the room And who knows If Nag would kill me by mistake He would think that I am you! Ha! You've found what to be afraid of! Nag is in the garden And you don't even go there And what do you know about Nag? I? I don't know anything But Chua told me That Nag, you see, he is everywhere! Shh! Don't you hear, Rikki? Bite the big human And come back Together we will kill the mongoose But do we benefit From killing the humans? Of course! Remember when the house was empty Were there any mongooses around here? And our kids... When they hatch They will need peace I didn't even think of that If I attack now Nagina will hear Together they will defeat me Marvelloussss Nagina In the morning the big human will come here to wash his face I will wait for him here where it's cooler ... until dawn Do you hear me? Nagina didn't answer She's left! Look here, Junia This is our mongoose! Poor thing He saved all of us from death Is that you, Chuchundra? You're alive, Rikki! I've come to cry over your battered body Go cry over Nag instead At night I caught him by the scruff Listen, Chuchundra! The snakes were talking about eggs Do you know where they are hidden? Nah... You're no help Rejoice, oh tender mother! In battle the killer is killed Sing o'er your fledglings again The foe is buried away He who has saved all of us Do reveal his name! Rikki - the sparkling eye Rikki - the valiant boy Oh, you silly clump of feathers! Is it really the time for song? He's dead! Nag is dead! Yes! But Nagina is alive! If only I could reach your nest I'd give you a good whopping! Answer! Where's Nagina? Oh, wonderful hero! She's at the trash heap crying over Nag Oh great white-toothed Rikki! Leave my teeth alone! Tell me clearly Where are the snake eggs hidden? I! I know! Nagina buried them Under the fence at the melon patch Don't rush! It's near the trash heap And Nagina's there! Listen, Darzee Fly there And pretend to have broken your wing Let Nagina chase you! But Rikki Is it noble to destroy eggs? Baby birds come out of them! You are so silly! Only evil cobras come out of cobra eggs! So it's you who warned the mongoose That I want to bite him You've chosen the wrong place to limp around I've broken my wing! You shall die now! Where are you going? Look at me! Don't look behind! She'll swallow you! Fly! Fly away! Another day And it would be too late! Death to cobras! Rikki! Hurry up! Nagina is crawling to the house She is set on murder! Sit and don't move! You stupid humans who killed Nag! Death has come to you Nagina! Turn to me! Turn around! Let us fight! If you make a single step I will bite the boy! Go to the melon-beds See what happened to your babies This is the last cobra The princess cobra! Give it back! What's the ransom? I shall leave... ... this place And I shall never return You won't return because You'll soon be lying On the trash heap! It was me who killed Nag! Come out, Nagina! And fight with me!
