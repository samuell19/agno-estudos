Water Drops on Burning Rocks Come in. Prost. I don't know why I came with you. I had a date. How old are you? No, let me guess. 19? That's it. Well, 20 actually. My birthday was one week ago today. Age doesn't matter to me. - Really? - No. And me? How old do you think I am? I don't know, 50? 50! No one's ever said that! But that's it, isn't it? Precisely. I was supposed to meet Anna tonight. She'll be mad. It's weird, I really wanted to see her. What made you say 50? You talk like people that age. Really? But physically, don't I look younger? Yeah, physically you look much younger. Maybe I'll go straight to Anna's. Anna and I want to get married. We need to find an apartment, though. I see. Your place is nice. I don't like it much. I haven't really moved in yet. Can you drive me back? It's pretty far. Naturally, when the time comes. Are there other rooms? A bedroom. Want to see it? It's very small. But it's just for sleeping, occasionally other things. Room size doesn't matter, it's the bed that counts. You're right. Of course I'm right. I'd love to find a place like this. When are you moving out? Why do you ask? I'm sorry. It was a joke. Don't be sorry. I've got a sense of humor. Are you married, or engaged? No, unfortunately. I lived with a woman for 7 years. Where is she now? I don't know. I left her. She couldn't adapt to my way of thinking. I really loved her, nevertheless. But she was never satisfied, too complicated. Known your fiancee long? Pretty long, nearly 3 years. We were at high school together. I see. I can be a real pain. It's hard on her. Do you love her? I've stopped asking myself that. We get along well. What do you say? Women always ask if we love them. What do you tell her? I say yes. To keep her off my back. Why should I explain my feelings? It's not important. So what is important? Books, theater, art in general. So what do the two of you talk about? I tell her why I think life is worth living. Or sometimes we just sit there, not talking. You can't always talk. My girlfriend and I mostly made love. That was good. But whenever we talked, we argued. We made great love. That isn't important to me. I don't get much out of it. Most times, anyway. Sometimes I just do it because it seems like I should. And your girlfriend? Anna? I don't know. I've never asked her. She lies down... I think she enjoys it. You mean, she moans? No, she's always quiet. My girlfriend was different. She could never get enough. It was fantastic! Yeah? Yeah. But things got so difficult. We couldn't open our mouths without fighting. Why? Oh, I take so little pleasure in things. Not just sex, but life in general. When things are new, yes, there is a certain charm, but then... You seem to get off on life. Yes. Want to play a game? I don't know. Do you like games? Yes, some games. I like chess. I'm afraid I don't know how to play chess. I'd love to learn. Maybe you can teach me sometime. Sure, sometime. How about ludo? I don't know. You approach me, bring me home, now you want to play ludo. Why? Because playing games helps you get to know people. Why do you want to know me? Because you have brown eyes, red hair and muscular legs. What color do you want? Black. I'll take black. I always wear black. It doesn't suit you. You should pick another color. Green would look good with your hair. Yeah? If I had a place, I'd paint half of it black. That'd be depressing. My one black wall makes me ill. Your turn. I've tried to decorate this place with some class. It looks good. 6... I'll roll again. 5. I haven't played ludo in ages. Last time was with my cousin. 6 years ago. 6! 6 years! Better pay attention, I'm winning. 5 - 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom! Back to square one. What a drag. You smoke a lot. So I'm told. You c be careful. It's unhealthy. - I know. - You bite your nails? When I'm nervous. Smoke less, you'll have better skin. Nicotine ruins the skin. But I like it. My turn. 4 - 1, 2, 3, 4 and boom! Sorry. You don't like to lose. In boarding school I went nuts when my team lost. If I lose, the game is pointless. You went to boarding school? That's of no interest. I'm interested. I wish I'd gone to boarding school, with lots of boys. But my parents never abandoned me. Be glad. I hated it. But why? I think it would be fun. Fun? You don't realize. I always wished I had a home to go to. And your parents? They divorced when I was 5 or 6. Lots of young people come from broken homes these days. Maybe. But everyone reacts differently. I had a hard time. I wish things had been different. Do you love your parents? My mother. I really love my mother. That's good. I like boys who love their mothers. I love her like a friend. We get along well. Do you live with her? No. She remarried and I hate her new husband. That's a problem. I live alone right now. But when Anna and I find a place things will be like I always wanted them to be. If I ever have kids, I want them to have a real home. You like children? No. I mean, I don't know how to act with them. Have you ever slept with a man? What brings that up suddenly? I'm interested. At school stuff would happen, it was innocent. Really slept with a man? No. What went on? I don't know how to tell you or why you're interested. Just tell me what it was like. Well, we were four to a room. Sometimes, at night, without warning, one boy got in bed with another. Flaxer usually got in my bed. Joachim Flaxer, that was his name. We'd fondle each other a little, it went pretty fast. - With your hands? - Yes. Once he kissed me. Tongue and all. That turned me off, it was disgusting. Why? Because I was a boy and so was he. It was a weird feeling. He never tried again. And otherwise? Otherwise? Twice I dreamt that my mom had married this man. Both times it was the same one. He looked good. Dark features, black hair. He got into bed with me. Both times I had... I don't know how to say it... Did he talk to you? I don't think so. So, what was he like with you? I was in bed, then he came in and took off his coat. It was strange, he had his coat on. He took off his jacket and pants. I didn't say anything, I just watched. He took off his shirt and underwear. How were his legs? Muscular. Like a football player. Did he have a hairy chest? Yeah, a real bush. What happened? He got into bed, and I felt like I was getting smaller and smaller like a girl. Then what? He entered me like I was a girl. He laid on me as if I was a girl and I probably was, in the dream. You've never wanted to try with a man in real life? No, it never occurred to me. Let me be frank with you. I did live for years with my girlfriend, but I also slept with men off and on. Usually it was much more exciting. It started unexpectedly. I was at the beach, swimming, when I saw a guy and I thought, ''I've got to have him.'' So I just chatted him up. He understood right away. Werner was his name. We went to my place. I was 22. It's strange, I found it much better than with girls. Maybe. I saw him again several times. I ran into him recently. He's really aged. I didn't want to kiss him either. At the time, it seemed unnatural. But it really isn't, it's exactly the same. In fact, the ancient Greeks... I know, the ancient Greeks... So, now you want to sleep with me? Why not? Yeah, why not? Really, why not. You've got big legs and a hairy chest. More or less. Will you kiss me, too? If you let me. This feels weird. I drank too much. Oh well, tomorrow it'll make more sense. Your skin is soft. It's nice. - I'm a good kisser, huh? - Very good. Is this how you operate? Sometimes. I fell for it, didn't I? Get undressed and go to bed. I'll come like your dream man. Shall I wear a coat? I'll wash the glasses and be right in. I knew it was you. Of course it's me, who else? You OK? I'm tired. Naturally. You had a long drive. I don't need a long drive to be tired. You can be tired anytime. Incredible. I just mention I'm tired and you get snippy. I'm not snippy. I know, I know. Pretty soon, you'll be right, and I'll be wrong. Who cares who's right or wrong? I don't need to be right. So why are you so defensive? I'm not. Get off my back. My head hurts. - Are you hungry? - A little. I'll fix you something. Want a drink? Whatever. - Tea or coffee? - Anything. I don't care. OK. Can't you walk quieter? You're unbelievable! Can't you wear slippers? You know shoes are noisy. Of course. I'm sorry. Don't be so sarcastic, you know I'm right. I wasn't sarcastic. You are right. Of course I am. Of course. Can't you be careful? I take so little pleasure in things. I don't need to live with someone who gets on my nerves! Here we go. You're never happy. What's that supposed to mean? I just asked you to wear slippers. Shoes are too noisy. Am I asking too much? No. I said I'm sorry. What more do you want? You're sorry? Did you hear yourself? Just leave me alone. You're picking a fight. Me picking a fight? No way. I could blow up at you right now, but I have no desire to. You're right and I'm wrong. Leo... Come on, leave me alone. Got cigarettes? Shit, only one. Here. You can have it. No, take it. I'll get more. Thanks. Make sure we've got cigarettes from now on. - Here. - You keep them. Must that thing be on all the time? No, of course not. But I thought you'd like music. Put the record in its sleeve so it won't get dusty. Anyway, the needle is bad. It was bad before I came. Before you came? I rarely used the stereo. It couldn't have been bad before you came. Why is it so cold? Must it be? I forgot to light the stove. I didn't know you'd be home. Keep it lit. You'll get fewer colds, so will I. I catch your colds, and I'm no good for days. Sleeping together spreads germs. You don't have to sleep with me. That's not what I'm saying. You know I love sleeping with you. Oh yeah? You take everything the wrong way. I'm not asking much. You could be nicer when I come home. You could ask me about my day. How was your day? Since you asked, I'm a wreck. I'm filled with anxiety. I've always got some pain somewhere. I take pills, then my stomach hurts. You should see a doctor. But when? Tomorrow's Sunday. I'm leaving Monday. So soon? Yes, of course! Everything's gotten so difficult. I can't sell anything. I don't know, but it seems like since I've known you, I've Iost my touch. Since you've known me... Yes. I'm always so anxious. Running around with no time to myself. You're exaggerating. But you only know me in bed! Speaking of which... we're still pretty good in bed, huh? It doesn't get any better. You like sleeping with me, huh? Yes, it's true. You get lots of pleasure? You could say that. What is that supposed to mean? It means yes. - I like making love with you, too. - You do? Of course I do. I don't want anyone else. The idea never crosses my mind. Me neither. No women or other men. I never want another man after you. What do you mean, after me? We said we'd be together forever. Forever is a big word. Someday you'll find someone to replace me. I just told you I have no desire to sleep with other boys. Maybe not today. I hate thinking about it, but I can't help it. That's your own fault. I haven't done anything. How will you leave me? God, you're complicated. You get on my nerves. Oh, fuck this. Franz... I'm here. - Yeah. You're here. - So? Monday you're gone again, for a whole week. What did you do this week? I cleaned house, did all the laundry, and waxed the floor. It doesn't show. Well, I waxed it. Did you use steel wool? I didn't know I should. You need steel wool to get a good shine. Next time I'll use it. I got a job. Oh yeah? Where? At a publishing house. Doing what? I'm not sure yet. I'll see. What's your pay? 5 marks an hour, but I set my own hours. I don't feel well. Neither do I. I killed someone, Franz. - Really? - Yes. Not directly. One of my customers blew his head off. You know, the one from Ludwigshafen. All week, I've been wondering if it's my fault. I went nuts. I bawled everyone out. I had visions. There were devils and spirits laughing at me. It was like I was someone else, watching myself from the outside. I don't know if I'm responsible for his death. If the police came, what would I say? In this town I didn't know, it was like everyone knew I had killed someone. I felt abandoned, alone. Tell me, what should I do? Say something! I don't know... How did it happen? How did it happen... I cleaned him out with the insurance, he must have realized... You're not responsible. It happens. I know I'm not technically responsible, but I still feel like a bastard. He was old, he'd saved up since the war. So, he killed himself over money. But he had nothing else, Franz. No wife, no children. You're tired. Let's go to bed. I can't sleep right now. It'll be alright, one way or another. Yeah, one way or another. We've been together exactly 6 months today. Really? Shall we toast it? Yes, let's toast it. Prost. It's good. Yes, it's good. I'm a good kisser, huh? Very good. Is this how you operate? Sometimes. I fell for it, didn't I? Get undressed and go to bed. I'll wash the glasses and be right in. Hello. Is Leopold here, please? Yes, but he's sleeping. He must be tired. He just returned from Ludwigshafen. Are you one of his customers? Sort of. Want to come in and wait? You're very kind, thank you. I'll come back. Want to leave him a message? No, please... Please don't tell him I was here. Whatever you say. Thank you, goodbye. Your bath is ready. Are you hungry? Not yet. Maybe after my bath. Did you sleep well? We can't sleep two in that bed. It's too drafty. We must do something. Like find a place without drafts. - You should look for one. - I know. You know, but you don't do it. You act like it's impossible. It's not that easy. Try harder! I'll find one. Stop it! I've got to take my bath. For God's sake! Shut off the music! Asshole! Motherfucker! How can you be so selfish? I've really had enough! What am I doing with you? I should move out! Bastard! I wrote you a poem. I'd like to read it, but I don't have time. I need to figure out that damn bill. Obviously. What's that sarcastic ''obviously'' supposed to mean? I have to do this for work. Don't take it wrong. I haven't. It's funny, you always add something. You always have to have the last word. Do you know where I put it? No, I don't. Naturally. ''Naturally.'' When you need help, there's never anybody there. Now that's ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. It's just a fact. Never anybody there... Whatever. Don't be paranoid. It's not about you. It's a general observation. You find it? I can't find anything, it's such a fucking mess! I didn't touch anything. Then I should be able to find things! It's like everything's been moved. ''The hat goes on the 3rd nail, not the 4th.'' That's beside the point! I should be able to find my things! But I have never touched your things! - Why are you so angry? - I'm not, it's just the truth. Leave me alone 5 minutes, go in the other room. I'd have found that damned bill, if it wasn't for you! I could leave for more than 5 minutes! - What's that mean? - You get me. You want to leave? Why not. OK, pick up your shit, call a taxi and get out now. I don't need my stuff. You keep it. No, take it with you, I'm sick of it! Go on. - Then what? - What, then? - We'll never see each other again. - How could we? OK. As you like. You want to have your cake and eat it too? I love you, but that's asking too much. Why? We're good together, we just can't live together. Think it over for a week. We'll find a way to work it out. Right, we'll work it out... Why are you getting dressed? Because I'm leaving. For where? I don't know and I don't care. You can't leave like this. That remains to be seen. OK. Whatever you want. See you. You don't mind that I'm leaving. Sure I do, but you don't believe me. You expect me to believe you, sitting there like you don't even care about me. You know I have to work hard, or I won't get ahead. I'm not getting anywhere as it is. I'm just going backwards. I can't help you with that. One day there was something they couldn't agree on, a little, unimportant thing, a difference, but from then on, there was no common ground between them, only differences. Aren't you working today? Shit! Work calms the nerves. But I'm not going to force you. Good. However, I think you could make an effort to chip in. With my lousy salary? I told you how you could make some pocket money. Still want me to play whore, do you? Make any food? Bluhm... Yes. Who? Yes, he's here. Phone for you. Here. A young woman. Ah, it's you. I'm fine. Yes, that was him. This week? Got the address? OK. See you soon. - Who was that? - Anna. - What's she want? - Just to talk. Can't she talk by phone? Maybe something's wrong. Or she just wants to see me. You don't mind? Why should I mind? No reason. You never have a reason. - Will it be long this time? - I told you I don't know yet. It depends on work. Someone has to bring home the bacon. Don't I get a kiss? Sure you do. Bon voyage. The door is open. Franz, are you home? What's wrong, Franz? You're crying? What's wrong? I love you. What do you mean, you love me? Got a cigarette? Light it. There's gin in the kitchen. Bring two glasses. OK. Prost, Franz. To us? To us, Anna. Although there is no more ''us''. Why do you say that? You don't seem happy here. You're sitting in the dark, crying. Something seems wrong. That's not true. I'm happy. Anyway, what is happiness? I don't know. Being satisfied and caIm... like we were. We never knew happiness, Anna. We just dreamt about it. Happiness is something else. Here, I may well have been happy. At first, everything was so different. But maybe it was just a dream. What happened? I don't know... One fine day everything I did and said was wrong. He was no longer happy with me. Why? Stop asking questions. Tell me about you. There isn't much to say. Everything is like before. Almost everything. Almost? Yes. Almost. What's changed? Franz, I've met a man who wants to marry me. Is that why you called me? I wanted to see you again before I said yes. Why? Because I love you, not him. Don't say anything, not just yet. Think about it. Why should I think about it? I love Leopold. End of story. But what about all our plans? Our children, our house? That was all bullshit. No, Franz. We could have made it, if you... Anna, you're still dreaming. Marry this man. Have his children. I'll be godfather. You're cruel. Why are you so cruel? I'm not cruel, just realistic. We've known each other exactly 4 years today. What is it? ''We've known each other 4 years... ...we must celebrate.'' C'mon Anna, that's just stupid sentimentality. But we always used to celebrate it. Really? I forgot. Life changes, Anna. Listen to you. You've changed. You, too. You've changed. For the better. You're much prettier. You're just saying that. Did you enjoy it when we had sex? Of course I did. Really enjoy it? I don't know. It depends which times. I still like you a lot. Me too, I love you. What's the matter? should something be? I don't know, you're so quiet. I don't have anything to say. Let's talk about how many kids we'll have. How many, 5? No, 2. 2 kids are plenty. What will we call them? We'll have 2 boys. They'll be named Franz and Leopold, Leopold and Franz. You must stop thinking about him. We're still at his place. But today we'll pack your bags and leave. - Got any money? - A little. A little? How much is that? You never used to care about money. It'll be enough. If you say so. We'll look for a place. With 2 rooms. Again? Don't worry, I'll handle it. You can read books, go to the theater, and tell me about it. Anna, you're dreaming again. You know reality is always different. Why? Because I'll have to find a real job. But I've already got a real job. What've you told them? I'm on vacation for another 2 weeks. I have to work all summer to make it up. We went to Greece last summer. That's over now. Next time you go to Greece, it'll be with me. I guess so. What should I do about Leopold? I must see him and explain everything. What for? Write him a letter, tell him it was great, but now it's over. Yes, I'll write him a letter. But when he comes home Saturday night it'll be cold here, he'll be alone. So? That's what he wants, isn't it? Yeah, that's what he wants. Now, let's get dressed. We've got a lot to do. I'd like to stay in the bedroom awhlie. Of course. Don't take it badly. It's just I liked it here. I'm not saying anything. I understand completely. It's not easy for me to leave like this. Alone, I never could have. But now we're together, and we'll make it. Yes, we'll make it... What's wrong? Didn't we agree to leave? Yes, it's OK. I just want to stay a bit longer. Is that too much to ask? No, it's alright. - You know? - What? I think I still love him. I think I love him a lot. But you know it won't work in the long run! Put on a record. Which one? You know the one. Obviously... Franz, someone's at the door! Hello, Madam. You alright? It's nothing, excuse me. I got the wrong door. It's OK. It was a mistake! What's wrong now? You're crying again... You've got to forget him. It isn't so easy! But you must. We've got to start over. Someone's here. My God! What is it, Miss? Uh, nothing. You're back aiready? Aren't you glad to see me? Sure I am. Introduce us! Mr. Bluhm, meet Anna I've told you about... Hello. We were just moving out. That's a good one! Make some coffee, Franz. Come sit next to me, Miss. Perhaps I should get dressed? That won't be necessary. You're perfectly lovely as you are. Wow, you've got an eye for that, too? - Why not? - I just thought... So Franz wants to move? Yes. We're getting married. Oh? You think Franz is the marrying kind? Why not? Tell me, dear Anna, do you love Franz? Why shouldn't I love him? He's still very young. Is that a reason not to love him? Of course not. On the contrary. Thank you. Would you serve us please? So, you want to move? Why only now? Why not ''only now''? You wouldn't have left without saying goodbye? - Who knows? - I know. I'll get it. Leo, Helmut left me. Excuse me, I don't know you, who are you? Leo, it's me, Vera. Vera, my dear! My God, how you've aged. You never said he was so sexy for his age. Now I understand. So go fuck him, slut. Anna, Franz, this is Vera, an old friend. I mean a former buddy who cut his dick off in Casablanca. Hello, Madam. Hello. Excuse me, you're the woman who put up with Leo 7 years? If it had been up to me, we'd still be together today. Vera loves to be tied down, especially by the hands and feet. Always willing to be displayed, mauled... isn't that right? You too, huh, Franz? - Want to humiliate us? - Unbelievable! Instead of being happy to see me, you moan. Don't worry, we're leaving. Anna? I want to stay awhile. The situation is so exciting! Fine, I'll go alone. What's wrong, Franz? Not happy I'm back early? If you only knew how happy I am. Don't be angry, my little man. Try to behave in front of my old friend Vera, please. Thrilled to make this dear lady's acquaintance. Franz, be nice. Why be nice? I don't get it. You're all so bizarre, like puppets, manipulated by God knows who! Franz loves me. Deep down he is crazy about me. I'm crazy about him! Tell him just how crazy. We've made love for two days straight. We got lots of pleasure. Naturally. I've taught him well. You should thank me. Oh, I do thank you. I'm eternally grateful. Aren't I, Franz? - Yes! - Leopold! Yes, my dear? I need to talk to you alone. Hold on a minute, wait your turn. Nice game you've got going. Unfortunately, I didn't win on purpose. A little diversion... for four. You disgust me. Near the closet are... Your slippers? I'll get them. Leo's nice little slippers. There you go taking it badly again. I'm not taking it badly. - Sure you're not. - I'm not. I know. - How do you say it? - How it's said! Girls, I'm hungry! Fix me something. - What? - Some beer? Hop to it! Whatever, a snack... Check the fridge. Was it a good week? I mean, was there another suicide? Oh, that's too bad. Why is it so cold here? The stove's not lit. So light it. God, it's obvious. I'm not asking much. So do it yourself. Here's a little sandwich. Put it down there. Give me the beer. Can I put on a record? That's enough! Everyone in the bedroom. Aren't you coming? You need me? You need me! I'll be right there. You're wearing my coat. I was cold. Why are you crying? Because I'm unhappy. Not fucking anymore? I'm fed up. He's only interested in her. Fresh flesh wins out. He never would've done this to me before. Before he was very different. 10 years have passed, I just got dumped, he doesn't care. Can you understand that? No, I don't understand, either. I've suffered in every way imaginable. So much sadness. Even after all these years? I'll suffer forever. Can't you forget him? How could I forget him? Even with the others, I think of him. I'm his creature. How so? When I met Leopold, I had just come to Germany. I was like you: young, innocent, and most of all, lost. Starved for love. He taught me everything about sex. It was wonderful. He was so good, he made me feel like I existed for the very first time. I was happy. That is, until he stopped desiring me. He touched me less and less. Everything changed. It was unbearable. So, I took a drastic measure, crazy, crazy with love... He'd once said to me, ''If you were a woman I'd have married you.'' I had a sex change for him, out of love for him, so he'd want me again. I was a boy and I became a woman. I spent all my savings. For awhile, his desire was revived. It was the newness... I deluded myself. Then the desire died again. He made me a whore. Then he left me. You still love Leopold? Me too. In the true sense of the word... I love him. How do I look to you? I don't know. Not bad. Thanks. I'm not too old for you? No, you're still beautiful. Well... Maybe we could try something together. It's too late. Why? I took some poison. Really? - But why? - Why not? You're so pale! Go get me the telephone. Mom? It's me. I took some poison. Nothing can be done. There's no point in coming. Maybe I'll go to heaven, since I'm so young. Thanks, Mom. What did your mother say? Bon voyage. She has no heart. She does, but just in the right place. Now let me die in peace. Is that too much to ask? You sound like Leopold. That's no surprise. I'm his creature, too. Do you like your job? Not much. How much do you make? It depends. Not a lot. Would you like to earn more? I know an easy way to make money. You'll need to work for me. Why not? Like a little spanking? Here we go. He's really dead. So young... Come here, please! Now what? Your friend is dead. Franz? No, he's just being melodramatic. He's not. He's dead. You're right. This is horrible. What will we do? There's nothing we can do. You killed him? Me? What are you talking about? You disturbed him. He could've lived to 80, or at least 70. What's going on? He's dead. Who? My God! - Calm down. - Who'll father my children? Little Franz and Leopold... Go back to bed. I'll be right in. Hello, my dear lady. Bluhm speaking. Sorry to bother you. Your son is dead. Oh, you already knew. Well... What? No, that's no problem for me. Not at all. Sorry for disturbing you. Goodbye, Madam. I want to go, there's a corpse here. I know. We must call the police, and then... I'd like to get my coat back. We'll do that later. Get undressed and come join us in bed. I'll wash my hands and be right in. You don't need me. You need me.
