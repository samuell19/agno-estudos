Some married woman's snatched symbol of marriage... ...and the wealth snatched from innocent people. I don't want it. That same lecture? There is still time, Thakur. Agree to it. Otherwise, one day you will remember this same lecture and cry. Thakur. When the children find out that their father is a dacoit... ...what will they feel in their hearts? When the villagers will find out that Radha's husband is a dacoit... ...they will claw at us like vultures. They will burn all of us alive in this house. There isn't any other mother in this world... ...who has given birth to a son to even touch... ...the shadow of my wife and children. I have strength. I have power. I will burn the whole village. How many houses will you burn, Thakur? And why do you forget... ...amongst those houses, your house exists too? In that fire, even your house will be burnt. That is too much, Radha. Don't say anything further than this. Otherwise, I will take my children with me too. Surely, take them. Make them dacoits too. And when they grow up to be dacoits... ...go and shoot the first bullet in their mother's breast. And then, with that same blood put the victory mark on the forehead. Your name will become immortal.

When the inhere tent of the family won't exist... ...then who will be there to take your name? Thakur, I beg of you. Please don't sacrifice my son in the name of your family.

The one who ruins mother's laps... ...and fulfills his greed. Where is that chief of yours? He is your Thakur too, Radha. Yes. It is this unfortunate woman, who Had to see this day too. Don't forget, that Raju is the friend of your children. One is a rich, lawmaker, who has... ...draped the blanket of society on himself. And another... ...is a man running away from the law, a dacoit. In whose neck the society has put a black mark? How can their children be friends, Radha? But a human can be friends with other humans. - I have come to take Raju. - Aunty, save me aunty. These people will kill me, aunty. [WHIMPER] Aunty, please take me to my mother. - Don't worry son.

The people who look at them, their eyes will be gouged out. - Let this child remain here, Radha. - No. I won't allow you to play with the life of a helpless child. Where am I playing with this child's life, Radha. I am just flirting with his father's safe. It is a sin to get other people's money through force. Stop this lecture! Chandan Singh, take this child away. Don't you dare! Wait Chandan Singh! Or else I will shoot myself. No! Radha! No! Not this! That's it? If someone stepped on your shadow, you shout?

All my three children were washed away in the storm. - I am ruined! - No! What will be the use of looking at the duty weight, Thakur? You have insulted duty. Fate has spread thorns in your path. If your strength is higher than God's strength... ...then settle this ruined house once again. Go and bring my sons back to me. [RITUALISTIC BELL RINGING] Thakur, where is your power now? Where is your pride? Thakur. Your sin became a storm and destroyed my lap. My house was ruined, my children were separated. All my three children were separated from me. [FLAMES CRACKLE] [BABY CRYING] [BABY CRYING] [GASPS] Munna! Munna! [TRAIN HONKS] Sit down nicely. Oh! My purse. My purse has been taken! - Oh my watch! - Oh my wallet!

I was separated from my parents in the flood. I lost my brother and sister too. You are very lucky. What about your parents... ..and your siblings, the whole village was ruined in that flood. People have died like cats and dogs there. Not a single soul is left over there... Come on, get lost! Uncle... uncle... uncle... Uncle, I don't have anyone in this world, uncle. Please take me with you, I will work for you, uncle. [TRAIN HONKS ECHO] No, Thakur. No. This is not possible. [CLACK] We will never surrender to the police. Thakur himself has taught us the lesson... ...take the bullets on the chest, but don't bow to anyone. We should fight till the last drop of blood in our bodies. And today, Thakur! ...you want to surrender all our arms in from of police. Yes, Chandan. Because today, I have found out... ...that the lesson I taught you was wrong. The road that we were walking on... ...was a never end road of crime and sin. Chandan... it seems as if funeral pyres... ...are burning on every part of my body. You will have to surrender yourself to the police. Or else, all of us will burn in this same fire. Wow! When you used to burn the people alive... ...you didn't feel about your sins at that time? The blood of the people were flown like water... But there was not a drop of sweat in the forehead... If your children drowned in the flood... ...a dacoit's soul was drowned. You have become a coward. You have become a coward, Thakur! Nobody can call Bhawani Singh a coward! My conscious hasn't washed away. My conscious has come back. And now, I think that I was a coward previously. I have taken that cowardly face and thrown it away. What kind of bravery is this? That we come out in broad daylight in disguise. If we sleep, we sleep with arms as pillows. Chandan! Neither a house nor outside... ...a mere whiff of breeze startles us... ...and we sit up as if it was a police bullet. Leave this unknown dungeons, come with me. Come with me to the settlement of humans. Come on. The settlement which we destroyed... ...and made them a dungeon ourselves, Thakur... ...we cannot make those settlements prosperous again. - Tell, friends! - Yes. Yes. We cannot go. We cannot go. Did you listen to that, Thakur? You were the chief till yesterday... ...so they were loyal to you. Today, I am the chief... ...therefore, all of them are loyal to me. I bow to all your loyal people for the last time. Thakur. Neither will you go from here and... ...nor will the police get your dead body. You are Ex- chief and we will attend to your funeral rites. Bhawani Singh's funeral rites won't... ...be looked after by any dacoit now. [GUN SHOT] [SHATTERS] [GUNSHOT] [GUN SHOTS] [HORSE NEIGH] Who are you? I am the runaway from law and police. The Dacoit Bhawani Singh. How dare you come into the police station? The law couldn't reach Bhawani Singh. Therefore, he himself embraced the law today. It seems that you have thought a new trick today. The dacoit is a strange man, Inspector. He plays various tricks to save himself from being arrested. And when he come/s to surrender... ...himself to the police, the police... ...thinks that he has come with a new trick. BHAVANI: This is the proof of my word, Inspector. Write on this blank paper any punishment that you like. Bhawani Singh will bow his head and accept it. [GUN SHOT] [SHATTERS] [HORSE GALLOPING] Inspector! Give us Bhawani.

Only the walls of prison will be between us. You have shattered the walls of sin and crime. Radha. You have brought a new soul in my life. You have given me a new birth. The only sorrow I have today is... ...if only my children were with me today. They would see their father repenting. Hey! What kind of mark is this on you?

It would have been better if you thought... ...before coming to Shiva's locality, elder brother. The one who vanquishes sinners... His name is Shiva. And the other name of Shiva is Shanker too, young man. Sin and good, both are weighed in Shanker's weigh of religion. - Sir! - Sir! Silent. I agree. Your hand is strong. It seems that you have drunk some lioness's milk. Sir! Very good, son. You are strong too. It seems... ...that even your veins have some lion's blood. Why? Did you like it? I liked it a lot. My principle is, I eat good and feed good too. Come on. - Come on! Dare you see that rogue and wretch! - No! Why are you just staring at me? Go and call the police quickly! Otherwise, these two monkeys will ruin my house. - Come on, go quickly! - Yes. Okay! [SIREN WAILING] Police! Oh my god! Run! - See Inspector, they are running away. - Please wait. Let's go. I am ruined! [SIREN WAILING] [GUN SHOT] - Hey! - Oh! Mother... Mother, please forgive me. This blood... At least the two of you stopped... ...shedding each other's blood because my blood was shed. [SIREN WAILING] - Did you see any rogue coming here? - Rogue? - Sir. He is running away there. - Come with me. Hey, where are you running away too? Are you the rogue whom the police was searching? Aren't you ashamed of doing such things? Mother, you are scolding me as if... ...you are my mother and I am your son. Does your mother not tell you anything looking at your antics? - When I don't have a mother, who will tell me? - What? Yes, mother. When the child falls down, he clutches a mother's finger. And he stops himself from falling. But... A mother's hand was snatched from this unfortunate person. After that... after that mother... I fell down and I kept on falling. [GROANS] Father... father... father... What happened father? Who did this to you? Father! Tell me father. The one who raised his hand on you... - ...I will raise him away from this world. - No! - I will bury him alive. - Don't do like this! Dad! For my sake. Tell me. Who had come? - Who had come, dad? - Shanker! He had come to ask for you. [GROANS] Hey what are you doing. You are hurting me a lot. Don't you feel ashamed to fight? Now you are shouting. Sometimes your head is hurt, sometimes nose. Had you hurt your eyes then people would have said "see, Shankar squint eyed's wife is going." [GROANS] No! No! Shanker! No! [SIREN WAILING] Arrest them! - Lock them up. - Come on in! [SLURRING] Hey! Why did you push me? - Sorry, sir. - Shut up. Why did he push me? Oh! But, why did he push me? Hey, but why did you push me? - Do you have a bottle? - Shut up! Do you have matches? [CHIMES] - We won't eat this animal food. - Is this food? This isn't good. This food. This is that food for which a poor mother sells her child. Sometimes, a sister is raped. A person kills another person. This food... is much better than the food... ...that you earn by thieving and robbing. Yes. Are you proud? Then swear that you won't touch this food. And that you won't even taste one morsel of it. Do you swear? The fire of this hunger is more than the fire of hell. Much better people have been burnt to ashes in this. And only food can extinguish this. Only food! Lift this. And eat it. Don't... ...ever do anything like that, due to which... ...the writer of fates becomes angry with you. - 'These people... These people... ' - Sir. I am Kasu, your servant, sir. Please don't be scared, sir. No. I am not scared. I was just seeing... ...if that wretched rogue Shiva is here nor not. Oh! I have placed him behind bars a long time ago. He must be counting the bars of the prison by now. Is it so? Is that the matter? Please let go of my hand. Put your hand in your pocket... ...and give me a chance to count the notes. - Oh the notes. The notes. - Yes. Give it to me, I will count them. What is the big deal in this? Munnibai. With this, the amount is five lakhs now. Yes. Where is my Chanda? She has become the noose of my neck. Without whom, I cannot stay alive any longer. Go please. She is waiting for you in the room. - Mine? - Yes. - Wait? - Yes. Chanda. Munnibai! Farce! - What happened, Seth? Did she bite you? - You have bitten me! You place false hair on a pillow and say that it is Chanda! Is this your business? That wretch has run away! Kasu! Sheru! Gangu! Search every corner of this city. Follow her! [GASPS] Hey! You are running as if hunting dogs are following you. - Please help me. - But for what? Some hoodlums are following me. They want to sell me to a Seth. Please help me. God knows where she has disappeared off too. Sister, they are coming this side. You don't worry. I will auction these wretches. Come with me. Oh! Thief uncle you. Since when are you in this? Ever since you sent Shiva to prison. - Hey girl, where is the Chanda? - You blind man. Uncle doesn't have business since morning. And you are asking for Charity? Hey, if you want the moon, go up there. - What are you doing here? - I am not talking about that Moon in the sky. - I am talking about this Chanda... - Move... Give this to me! Hey! Hey! Bijli! What are you doing? Who will pay for the petrol? Oh! I will be ruined! Silent uncle! This is the question of that girl's dignity! Come ahead. Come ahead. Give me the matches. Here are the matches. Burn them down. Burn them. - I will look at them right away! Here is Chanda! - Burn them. [SIGHS] Oh! You don't worry. This is Bijli's glass palace. This is one piece in the whole of India. This is as strong as iron. Even if a elephant smashes against it, his head will smash. If a bomb is thrown, it will go three miles backward. [SHOUTS] This wood is a little loose. The roof will come down. - Like that, nobody should come to know about it. - No. You be rest assured. Nobody can make a sound here. Everyone knows me. Shanker Dada, Birju Dadas, Kallu Dada... And one more... RADHA: Radha aunty. How do you know that? I didn't say anything. - Oh! Then who did? - RADHA: I did. Oh! Radha aunty, what are you doing here at this time? I came here worried. You didn't come since many days to take toys. What can I do, aunty? I am very worried. There are problems since a couple of days. Since a couple of days, wherever I set up shop... ...there is a municipality raid. One day, a constable... ...came with a baton and said, Hey girl! Take your toys! ' Then what? The almighty felt pity on me. The sir gave me a license. Now even if I set up shop in the... - ...police station nobody can stop me. - That's enough. Don't speak a lot. Or else you will be tired. - Aunty! - Oh! Who is she? Oh! She is my friend, spanking new. She has nobody in this world. She will stay with me from today. Ask for her blessings. - Oh! Oh! Child... - Greetings. Bless you. She is such a cute girl. Oh yes, aunty, money. Okay. I will leave now. Oh yes! Where is your would be husband? Please introduce me to him one day. From where will I introduce him? He has gone to his in- law's place. In- laws place? Oh God! Has he married? No, aunty. He calls the jail as his in law's place. But this is last journey. This time, as soon as he comes back... As soon as he comes back, he will marry me. You scared me off! Mischievous girl! Your aunt is so good. [SIREN WAILING] You... are you Chandan Singh's son? I am Jwala Singh. Bless me, Thakur. Thakur, I was born with my father's face... ...so that I can repay all the sins that my father committed. - Repent? - Yes, Thakur. If my dad had listened to you... ...then today, I wouldn't see this day today. I wouldn't be insulted in the eyes of the world. And in your presence... I wouldn't be in this situation in this presence. Jwala... When a man awakes from the sleep of sin... ...that itself is the wake up call of truth. The matter that Chandan Singh left incomplete... ...you will be completing that task. Your father's soul will get peace. My father's soul will know peace... ...when I smatter your body into pieces, Thakur. [MACHINE RATTLE] [CLATTER] If you are very proud of your strength... ...then use it in the right way. You have reached till here fighting amongst yourself. Now, do you wish to go to the almighty? Go. Go and do the work. Oh! Go. [MACHINE RATTLE] Drink it. Drink it. [SIPPING] [HONKING HORN] Sir... - Greetings, Jailor. - Greetings. - Is everything alright? - It is all your grace, sir. - Sir, I have a request. - Yes, tell me. This Jwala... this Jwala... Even he is human. Please uncuff his chains. Not at all. He is a dangerous dacoit. POLICE: He is a rabid beast. Sir. Before we came here, all of us were rabid beasts. But the government gave us a chance to change our ways. Why shouldn't he be given one too? Sir. He has changed into a good man in three months. Yes sir. And I take his total responsibility. - Yes. - Inspector? - Sir? - Uncuff Jwala Singh. Okay, sir. [CLUNKS] Greetings, Thakur. By your grace, the chains on my body were uncuffed. But the burden on my soul is very heavy. The chains of the body are unloaded. But the burden on the soul takes some time. Have some patience. [CHIMES] Come on, the bell has rung. Have your food. Put it. Put it. Give me food. See, today Jwala's chains have been removed. Today... I will give him food with my own hands. [GUN SHOT] [MACHINE NOISE] Take Bhawani Singh to the hospital. Quick. Thakur... Thakur... Thakur... - Nurse, bring these medicines. - What happened, Thakur? Doctor, please save my husband. - Please save my husband. - Please take courage. The bullet has passed through the body. He will have to be given blood immediately. Take all my blood. But please save my husband, I beg of you. - Dr. Mathur. - Bhawani's blood group is A1+. This blood group is not available in our hospital!? What? - Please take my blood. - And mine too. Maybe our blood is one and the same. Come on, come with me. Please come. God, please protect my husband. Save my husband God. Save my husband. Thakur. God has listened to me. He has saved my husband. - My husband has been saved. - Don't cry, mad woman. This body must be having some sinning blood. Today, even that must have shed down. [MUTE AUDIO] [FOOTSTEPS] Hey, don't cause trouble. Come on! Greetings, Thakur. - Greetings, doctor how are you? - I am all right. What is the matter? - Constable. I have to go very badly. - Go. Come quickly. I will come right away. You come. Oh! Brother Inspector. You? In this prisoner's uniform? A drama. A drama for 26th January. We are doing a drama for 26th January. Actually... the police men have become prisoners. And the prisoners... - ...they have become the police men. - Police men? Yes. The truth can be hidden by the lies. Sometimes, even paper flowers can be aromatic. You are reading the poem wrong. Wrong? Yes. The drama' name is Wrong Ganges! - Hey Shiva! - Who is it? - What is it? - Come quickly. Did you see that? He is calling me. This is strange. Brother, you are an inspector. And that constable is scolding you? He isn't scolding me, his uniform is scolding me. It is the morning, it is the evening. - The whole life is spent in the prison. - Wow! Wearing this prison clothes, you have become the leader of poets. - Thank you. - Sure. - I beg your leave. - Sure. The rehearsal for the drama is waiting. It is the morning, it is the evening. - What are you doing? - What were you doing there? There? It is the morning, it is the evening. Hey come on quickly, constable. Or else, my respect will be auctioned. "In the whole world" "Our country is the best." "In the whole world" Bhawani Singh... [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Bhawani Singh... For your services to the prison... ...and for your good deeds, the government... ...has given you this money and... ...five acres of land in Ramgadh. [STORM CLOUDS] POLICE: So that you can spend your future life comfortably. Bhawani Singh, you are free from today. Because... You have turned into a moral Idol for the country. - Jai Hind! - Jai Hind! [APPLAUSE] This is my last greetings to the people of this prison. Jai hind! [SIREN WAILING] POLICE: It seems that some prisoner has escaped. MAN: He has run away! He has run away! Oh! He has run away! Jwala Singh has escaped! [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] Jwala Singh has escaped! Today this convict has taken advantage of our sympathy. Henceforth, whenever you all are taken outside two convicts will be having a handcuff. And if anyone tries to escape, they will be shot. Lock them up. [CLUNKS] Come on. I am thirsty, I want to drink water. So go. Go and drink it. Why don't you come too? The well doesn't go to the thirsty person. The thirsty person goes to a well, understood? It is just the question of time, child. This chain has made us two body and shadow. [CHAOS] [GROANS] Hey!!! - Poor Ramu is dead. - He is dead. It is a good chance. Come on, let us run away. Run away if you want to. Child. How can I escape alone? One cannot clap with one hand. And right now, I have the clapping hand with me. Elder brother. We will clap later. Run away now. Come. Oh! The two have run away! They have run away! [GUN FIRING] [TYRE SCREECH] [GUN SHOT] - Come on, jump! - No! No! No! Hey, I don't know to swim. - The police are coming! Come on! - SHIVA: Hey! What are you doing? Are you dead? Hey! Get Up! He is alive! [SIGHS] Why are you saluting me? I didn't save you out of sympathy. Thank this chain. If you die, Where would I move with such a heavy dead body? [CLUNK] [SIGHS] Elder brother. It is my habit. I don't keep anyone's loan on me. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You didn't save my life, okay. But today... today, I repaid my loan. [BIRDS CHIRPING] "I may leave the world, but not the friend." "I may leave the world, but not the friend."

Even a beggar doesn't take two rupees. Hey, listen, listen. SHANKAR: If they have gone, let them go. We will carry them. SHIVA: Tell us quickly, where do we have to go? We are in a hasty for work. Oh! At least fix the price first. Why should we fix the price? He is my brother, you are my mother. This is the earning for both of us. Come on, mother. Wait! We were looking out for you two. Oh! Constable. These are very honest laborers. They agreed in two rupees. The rest of the laborers were asking for four rupees. - Yes! Okay, sister. Have you seen these two rogues? Sir, I have seen them. They were moving in this market. - They were having curd milk! - Where? - Here! - Here! What do you mean? One went to the west and another to the east. - Come on brother. - Come on brother. - Hold this. It will come in handy. - Soldiers, you go to the east. You two go to the west. I will see the north and the south. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SIGHS] Take madam, two rupees, that too cash! Hey! When were you released from prison? - We are on a holiday. - On a holiday? Why don't you tell the truth? The truth is that the government... ...looked at our previous, next, upper and lower record... ...and released us on the 26th of January. The day when India was released, mother. - Therefore, even we were released. - Correct. Okay. So you work as laborers now? Yes. We used to do bad things for wrong earnings previously. And now, we do good things to earn right. Correct. This is very good. I will tell the Thakur and get you two work in our fields. Come on. Come on inside. Let's go. If you go inside, the Thakur will put you inside. Mother, if we work on your fields... ...our fields will go all dry. Your fields? Yes. Mother, the government has... - ...given us twenty five acres of land. - Wow! Twenty five acres! - What? - You spoke wrongly, didn't you? Mother he means... We are two isn't it? So twelve and a half for him and twelve a half for me. - So, it is twenty five, isn't it? - Correct. He is very strong In accounts, mother. - Okay mother. We will leave now. - We will leave now. Where are you going? If the Thakur comes to know that you came... ...and went without eating or drinking, he won't like it. Come on come on. Oh! The thakur isn't at home. Mother will feel bad. Come on. Okay, Mother. If you say so, then how can we refuse you? You sit here. Freshen up. I will bring the food. Oh madam! Hey, keep it! [HYMN] Let's start. Wow, Shanker. I enjoyed it. I feel as if, I have had home food after many years. - Even I feel the same. - Good! Curd milk! [COUGHS] Munna! Oh! What happened son? I have told you so many times to take breath and drink water. This isn't water. This is curd milk, understood? Looking at you two, I feel like... [KNOCK ON DOOR] ...your uncle has come. [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Death's messiah has come. Get lost. - Get lost. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I am coming, Thakur. [KNOCK ON DOOR] You? Greetings. What have you come to take here? The Thakur and me have a lot of accounts. That will go on throughout life. That Thakur snatched my father from me and gave him to death. And today, I... ...will snatch his peace and happiness. I have come to sprinkle sadness in his house. [CLATTER] Where is Thakur? He isn't here. Whatever you want to say, tell me. Oh Go! You are a woman. What should I tell you? Manglu, the Thakur's fields are ripe. Come on. We will see it closely. I had an ambition since all my life. To trample his head. That couldn't be completed. Come on, I will trample his fields. [CRUMBLE] See, Manglu. Just like this red. Father's blood was red like this on his face. I remember. I will ruin his field. I will ruin his field! I will ruin! No Jwala, you can't damage our crops. I swear by you, this will happen. And it will happen in front of your eyes. Damage these crops! [SHOUTS] [GUN SHOT] Jwala, I beg of you, kindly stop your men. Please stop your men Jwala. [SHOUTS] Lady, whenever your crops get cut, Jwala will come and destroy them like this. Radha! Radha! Who did all this? How did all this happen? I ask you, tell me, how did all this happen? I will kill that man. Hey! There has been such destruction and you aren't answering? Radha, tell me. This Thakur Bhawani Singh won't spare him. He will cut his neck off. Radha, if you take Jwala's name... ...Bhawani Singh will take the gun again. He will kill the man settled in his heart... ...and will awake the dead dacoit inside him. The destroyed field can be green once again. But if the forehead is wiped once, it won't be filled again. No! No! No! Radha! I am being crazy in anger and you are silent? Tell me, who was that man? It wasn't a man. It was a pack of wild animals. Wild animals? They destroyed all the crops. Thakur! I was alone. I couldn't do anything... Oh! Radha! MUNNIBAI: Horrible woman, you have to tell me where Chanda is. - I don't know. - You don't know? You will get to know now! [GROANS] Munni Madam, how long will you continue doing like this with me. Brother, this lady also dances very well. We have seen her dancing on the road. She dances amazingly well. Sang well too. Hey you, are you talking about your mothers and sisters? Shut up girl! First you will dance in this brothel. After that in Harnam Singh's mansion. Then I will hand you over to the Seth. Wear this anklet now. Chanda Munni Madam, let her go. Great! Munni isn't stupid that she will let go of you. You both will stay here. This will never happen. Munni, you know Chanda's stubbornness. If you let Bijli go then I will do what you'll ask me to. Or else my dead body will go from here. No Chanda, I will give my life but I won't allow you step back here again! Munni Madam, try and understand. Your greed will not let you get one also. - Agree to what Chanda is saying. - Ok Mr. Seth. In Thakur Harnam Singh's mansion this will be the last dance of Chanda's life. After that I will sell off this woman to you forever. SETH: Okay. Oh! God! What happened? Shankar! Save Chanda! Save Chanda, Shanker! Who did this to you? Munnibai did. Chanda gave herself to Munnibai to save me. Where is Chanda now? Munnibai has taken her to Ramghad... ...to Thakur Harnaam Singh's bungalow. She was saying... ...that it was the last dance of her life. After that, she will sell her! [RITUALISTIC DRUMS PLAYING] Greetings, Thakur. Jwala Singh, you? - Congratulations on the wedding. - How did you come here? You forgot to invite Me. I thought that never invite one's own friends. Therefore, I came here thinking it was my home. Jwala Singh. I beg of you. Please go from here. Here. People fold hands and invite people in weddings. And you are telling me to go? See. My child's marriage procession has arrived. Let her marriage palanquin rise. After that, whatever you ask, I will give you. But... At this time, my respect is in your hands. Even your life is in my hands. Move your eyes around.

My daughter's marriage procession returned. If you want to kill us, kill us all together. Set this house afire. What is kept in this house now? What I'm trying to say to you is... ...this gentleman saved my life. A dacoit... who has killed people till today... How will he save anyone's life? He... he is the same person, who killed your brother. He extinguished the light of this house. Yes. And after that light was extinguished... ...even the light of my house was wiped way. I am repenting for my crimes since twenty years. But that darkness is so dangerous... ...that is increasing as time passes. Bhawani Singh... That darkness will bite you like a snake forever. Wherever you go, the shadow of your crimes will follow you. See, in this mirror. You can see your own evil reflection in this is. You will hear the mother's curses and children's shrieks! You will see the oceans of tears! See! See! See! Enough! Enough! That dacoit is dead and that mirror has broken. I... I have spent fourteen years in prison. Fourteen years. And I am no longer guilty to law. But I am still guilty to you today. I snatched just one child from you. But... your curse snatched three children from me. Thakur Bhawani Singh doesn't beg ever. But today... Today I beg you for your mercy. My heart says that my children are alive. Please say once, that you have taken back your curse. That you forgave Bhawani Singh. Mother, please forgive him. I swear to you, mother. He is the one who has saved your daughter. He has been paid for his actions a lot. Please forgive him. Go, Bhawani. I take my curse back. May God forgive you. - Shankar how will it feel? - Maharaj? Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Shankar madam.

"The love is heavier! " "I will leave the world." "I won't leave my friend." [HURRICANE] Shiva! Shiva! - [DOOR CREAKS] - [WIND HOWLING] Munna! My brother! Munna! You are my Laxman! I am Ram, Munna! Hey, you crazy boy! I am not only your friend, I am your brother too. Munna! Munna! Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Once... just once... embrace your brother, Munna. Just once! Munna... open your eyes, Munna! Munna! No! No! No Munna, I won't let you go. If... If anything happens to you, I will burn the whole world! Wow! God! My mother used to say in childhood... ...that you guard the one who has Shanker God on his forearm. Wow! You have guarded us so well. You snatched out parents in our childhood. You made us homeless and separated brothers. We didn't say anything. We didn't say anything. To fill our stomachs, you made us thieves and dacoits. Even then we didn't come to your door with a request. And after so many years, I met my brother... ...and that too, in such a situation... ...that death is dancing on his head. But remember this! This is not my brother's blood which is oozing, it's your brother's. My brother hasn't been shot, you have been shot. But today... If my brother is dead today... It won't be my brother's death, it will be your death! - [BELL CHIMES] - [STORM CLOUDS] - [STORM CLOUDS] - [BELL CHIMES] [BELL CHIMES] God! Man is so weak. But you are in this world to guard him even today. Today... Today, saving my brother, you saved this sinner from being an atheist. God! Please forgive me! Forgive me, god! Forgive this sinner! Forgive this sinner! Shanker! Shanker! See! This is our childhood symbols! - Ram! - Yes! - Brother! - Yes! You are my brother! [BIRDS CHIRPING] Thakur! Thakur... God has given you the fruit of Being on the path of good. - Our Ram and Laxman both are alive. - What? They came in our presence, but we didn't recognize them. When was this? In the hospital. The ones who gave you blood. - Oh! Shiva and Shanker! - Yes! - They are our children, Ram and Laxman? - Yes! - Shiva! - Shiva! Shiva my child! - Hey, Radha! This is our Munna. - Laxman, Munna! Munna! What happened to him? He is wounded. Who has hit him and kept him here? You take care of him. I will call the doctor. Munna! My Munna! My Munna! He is so wounded! My Laxman! My child! [HORSE GALLOPING] What happened, sister? Why are you so scared? This is the horse taps of the dacoit Jwala Singh! Please hide my son somewhere. - Don't worry, sister. - Please... quickly! What have you come to loot now? Greetings. I haven't come to loot anything. I have just come to ask three questions. The first question. Where is your husband, Thakur Bhawani Singh. The second question, where is Ganga? And the third question. That Shiva... sympathizer of Ganga, where is he? You may answer all three questions together. Or else, you can give it differently. I got the answer to one question. [HORSE GALLOPING] You rat! What are you doing here? I was eating this jowar. It is very sweet. Will you eat it too? JWALA: I dug a mountain and got a rat. I know that you won't say anything. Because even you have the arrogance of Thakur. But even I will play such a trick, that everyone will run to me! Mangal uncle! Catch her and come with me. Hey, rat. If the Thakur comes, tell him. To give me Ganga and take his wife, understood? - Shiva! - Thakur! Shiva has been thrown into the fire! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! Oh! Munna! [FLAMES CRACKLE] Shiva! Munna! Shiva! Oh God! Please save my Shiva! My Shiva! Doctor, please hurry up! - Tell me where Ganga is? - In India! - Tell me where Shiva is! - In the whole world! Aunty, you? - Not aunty! I am your mother! - Mother? Yes son! - Call me your mother! Yes! - Mother! You are my lost son, Ram. And Shiva... ...is your lost brother Munna! Your younger brother! JWALA: Okay. So you are their mother? If you had swallowed them as soon as they were born... ...at least they would have been spared my torture. - You wretch! - Silent! Before things turn around, I will burn your whole family. What! He has kidnapped my mother! - I won't spare that wretch! - Where are you going? You have gained conscious with such difficulty! You are wounded! That is my job. No, dad! Let me go! This locket... How did you get this? This is the locket of my accepted sister, Ganga. - Ganga? - Yes. Ganga is not your accepted sister, you fool. She is your real sister. She is my daughter. Not at all! Ganga is our daughter. Bhawani Singh, which trick are you playing now? BHAVANI: I am not playing any trick, Thakur. You are playing a trick. You can't turn the truth into false. You can't call other children your siblings. What proof do you have that Ganga is not our child? Does this locket not belong to Ganga? Swear to the Goddess Durga... ...that you have given birth to Ganga. BHAVANI: And your blood is running in her veins. Who are you to account for blood? Give me a proper answer to my proper question. MRS. HARNAM: Bhawani! Don't take a false swear on Goddess Durga. Remember... even you are a mother. Yes... yes. This is the truth. I haven't borne Ganga. And even this is true that the child had this locket. We got the child as she was moving in the Ganges. Since that day... ...we reared her as our daughter. We forgot our child's sorrow in her smiles. Ganga is my child. As soon as you took your curse back... ...I got Ganga's both brothers, Shiv and Shanker too. Then... Will you snatch Ganga from us? Bhawani... will you make us childless once again? Thakur... you had got my child from the Ganges. It has become Ganges's boon for you. She was your child previously and... ...she is your child even today. Bhawani, giving Ganga back... ...you have given us our life back. But... Jwala Singh has taken Ganga's mother... ...saying that, if you want Radha back... ...then give Ganga to him. Which isn't possible! Please let me meet my daughter before I leave. Mistress! Mistress! Ganga has written this letter before leaving. 'Mother I've heard everything.' 'I don't want that because of my life so many lives have to be sacrificed.' 'Mother, I'm going to save my Motherland.' [GUN SHOT] Thakur... these seem to be police's spies. Greetings sir! Greetings! Munnibai, what have you come to take here? I haven't come to take anything. I have come to give you. I have brought two bullets for you. [CHUCKLES] Bullets? Thakur! These bullets are very dangerous. Forget about he prey, even the hunter will be wiped away. Silent! You insolent wretch! Do you back answer the Thakur? Let it be! If she doesn't talk, how will she embrace me? But first... I will see the dance of this fair dancer. - She dances very well. - Yes, yes. Hey! Dance! I won't dance! You won't dance? I will make you dance. - Dance! - No! I won't! Listen girl. Listening to Jwala, people's fate dance too. Come on, dance! Kill me if you want. But I won't dance. [GROANS] Your whole family will dance too, you wretch! - Oh! Thakur! - Bijli? You are fire, and I am lightning. You are fire and I am fire too. What is the need of moon in the clash of fire? - I'll dance... - Bijli! Shanker! Aunty... you are here? All this is the play of fate, daughter. Shanker is my son. Shanker! Shanker! Bijli... Bijli... why have you come here? Munnibai... has brought us to be sold to Jwala Singh. Sir, this is the lover of Bijli. He has ruined my courtesan hall! You ruin his whole life! Thakur! See, what all I do to him, Munnibai. Your funeral pyre will burn today. Take her away. Bijli... This meeting of the lover and beloved is too much. Ignite the surroundings now. Dance. You dog! Bijli will dance in your presence. "We both have killer looks, we both have killer looks." "The surroundings will not be spared today." "We both have killer looks, we both have killer looks." "The surroundings will not be spared today." "You are a drunkard, you have a drink in your hands." "I have the whole bottle of wine in my eyes." "We are that thing that makes people crazy." "If the chalice is empty, we make people drink from our eyes." "This youth, this attitude... it has such intoxication." "Whoever drinks it, has fallen down." "Look at me, you fool! Look at me, you fool! " "Today, may the ambition of your heart be fulfilled." "We both have killer looks, we both have killer looks." "The surroundings will not be spared today." "One doesn't care about life in love." "One feels pain, but nobody even sighs." "The one who love, leave their house." "If they are killed, they bless their killers." "What do you know what fire this love is." "The fire was alighted in that heart... '" "...and there was a spark in this heart." "Understand what I have to say, beloved." "Understand what I have to say, beloved." "This isn't that difficult a thing too." "We both have killer looks, we both have killer looks." "The surroundings will not be spared today." "My name is Bijli if your name is Jwala too." "Don't think you alone are the strong one." "If both of us play against each other, it will be fun." "If fire meets fire, it will be fun." "Let you do something too, let me do something too." "Let the night set and then something will be done." "If you are wounded by someone... " "If you are wounded by someone too." "You will understand the words of another wounded one." "We both have killer looks, we both have killer looks." "The surroundings will not be spared today." GANGA: Jwala! [SIGHS] [SIGHS] You wanted Ganga, isn't it? I have come. Take me in your slavery. But leave my mother, Jwala. Hey, where did I kidnap your mother? I brought Bhawani Singh's wife. She will be my slave! This is my mother. What? - You are my lost daughter? - Yes, mother. I was separated from you in the storm in childhood. But today, the storm of fate has united us. - But in what state? - Ganga? Brother! Ganga, my sister. Why did you come in this hell? If due to me, all of you are saved... ...then I will think myself to be fortunate. I thought that I would make you my wife. I would make my enemy's blood the vermillion on your forehead. But you are so unfortunate. You are my enemy's daughter. [GASPS] I won't make you my wife. I will make you my mistress. You wretch! You are so low, that even after dying... ...the fire won't accept to burn your body. You dog! Let go of my sister! How do I leave her? How do I leave her? - Jwala has looted many times in the open market. - No! [GASPS] Let go of my daughter! Leave her, you murderer! Mother! [GUNSHOT] Thakur! [GROANS] [GUNSHOT FIREING] [GUN SHOT] Munna! Mother! [HORSE NEIGH] [HORSE NEIGH] [FLAMES CRACKLE] [GUN SHOT] [COUGHS] Son... Jwala Singh took your sister Ganga. [GROANS] Shanker! Hold this! Bijli, you run with mother. Shiva, you go. Come on, aunty. Come on quickly. Give me your hand, give me your hand. Bijli! Run! Come on. Make him run faster! Faster! Faster! These wretches! They are coming! Run! Take sister, tie these anklets! - Sure. - Quickly. Hit them! Move. - On your right. - Move. Move. You! Did you like these anklets! I am sorry, aunty. The horse is fast, so my tongue is fast too. Oh uncle Mangal! Run! Has the uncle come again? Come in our lap! Greetings, uncle. Uncle is it Monday or Tuesday today? No. Bijli. It is Saturday today. [HORSE GALLOPING] [HORSE NEIGH] [HORSE NEIGH] Let me go, you dog! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Ganga? Ganga! Let me go! Let me go! - GANGA: Let me go! - No! You rascal! Leave me! Mother! Here you are Thakur. All these bullets... Put them into this sinner! Take it! [PANTING] [HELICOPTER ENGINE REVVING] [FIRING] [FIRING] What about these valleys? Even the land and sky Can't hide you today. Kill him Thakur! Kill him! - Mr. Saxena? - Sir. Take Jwala Singh's body in custody. Okay, sir. Bhawani Singh? These are my sons who have run from prison, DIG. Now... I surrender them to the police. Bhawani Singh... In the light of justice, the law will give your children love. And because there was a reward on Jwala Singh's head. Either dead or alive, you will be rewarded. I have got the reward, sir. After spending fourteen years in prison... ...and the death of this sinner has told me... That this world is a religious weighing machine. There is heaven on one side and hell on another. "Religious weighing machine." "Religious weighing machine." "Religious weighing machine."
