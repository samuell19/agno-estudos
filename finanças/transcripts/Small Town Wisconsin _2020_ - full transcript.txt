Runner at second takes his lead. D'Amato has his sign. 2-0 pitch on the way. And that's a shot to left center. Screw me! Moron. And the batter's gonna pull in at second with a stand up double, so the situation just got a whole lot... Dammit, D'Amato, get your... Frickin' moron. Riba drove it right where he wanted to. D'Amato hasn't been able to do it right now. If he can settle down in this situation and get an out, Throw him the slider. Don't be a dumb-ass, D'Amato. You know he likes that fastball. Yup, if he's stupid. Gotta make him reach. Call it in. They need you, Wayne. Hey, would you shut up, Chuck? Hey, you should be General Manager now. Hey, all I'm saying is you've gotta make him reach. All I'm saying is D'Amato loves that high cheese, right? Thanks for that. But you know what, hey look at me. You know best. Yeah. Yeah, I do know best. Swing and a drive, deep center field! Are you shittin' me? Hey, that's enough. I'm sorry. Hey, no, I ain't kiddin' ya. That's enough out of you, Chuck! God dammit! What did I say about drinkin' while you're working, Wayne? It's after four, Elmer. I ain't even supposed to be here. Ain't getting paid either. 20 hours a week max. Told you 10 times. Yeah, I'm just trying to finish this up for ya. Well, I ain't paying you for it. Okay... Dokey. Fastball has not been working for D'Amato that much is clear so far in this game. You try to keep the spirits up. It's a long season. Yeah yeah, what do you think about that, huh? Yeah, yeah? Gimme my hat! Oh! Good night, mercy With you 'til the end The earth it keeps on spinning Good night The night makes you thirsty Drink up one more time Let's not start a fight now, good night There's no catch to All the ways I love you Do your best to Lock me out but I'm still here Good night, mercy The day comes to pass More for the lovebirds!

All right, I'll just wait out here then. Hey Wayne. How you doing? What you got going on today? Oh, not much, just play it by ear. We'll see. St. Augustine's having their carnival with the raffle and the dunker thingy this afternoon. Is that right? So listen... Since we got a moment here, I just wanna say about this court thing. I apologize. It's not personal. I need the job. Well take it. But no need to apologize, 'cause you're not taking my kid to New Mexico. Arizona. Wherever. Phoenix is a good place, Wayne. Not just for me, there'd be opportunities for... Whatever, Stu. You heard the judge last time this crap came up. I'm his dad, not you, okay? Hey, there's my champ! How's it going, pal? Good. Yeah, you ready to have a good weekend? - Yeah! - Huh yeah, all right! Why don't you wait in the car for a second, okay? Man, getting heavy. Hey, Dee. Can I just talk to you for a second? I was thinking that, maybe I don't know, I can keep Tyler 'til Monday? You know that way I'd get a little extra time with him, and it's the back and forth with the gas and all. Do you need gas money, Wayne? No, no, that's not what I'm saying. I was just thinking that, that I could get a little extra time with him. And I don't know, maybe... What about court Monday? Or Sunday school tomorrow, did you think about that? No. Okay, I need him back by 10, please. Ah, jeez! At the latest. What is it with the evil eye you've been giving me ever since I got here? You're late again. Yeah and I tried to call you to tell you that. I don't wanna hear it. I just, I don't want you disappointing our son. Disappointing him? What are you talking about? Did he say that? What happened to your car? Nothing, that's, that happened at work. That is a work mishap. Ah, jeez, for crying outside, can I just come pick up my son for once without getting the third degree? Sure, when you start acting like a responsible adult. Okay, fine. As a responsible adult, I gotta tell you, that guy over there? The French got a word for him, douchebag, okay? I don't like the way he looks at me. I don't like the way he talks, he talks to me like he's the dad. For crying out loud, I'm the... Great. Hey champ. You ready to hit it? Yeah. Yeah? All right, why don't you go get in the car? Have him back on time, please. Sorry. Any trains coming? All clear? Clear. What? I asked you if there were any trains coming. Oh. I was thinking about something else. What kind of co-captain are you, you're not gonna tell me if a train's coming or not? Oh, okay. Come on. Hey, all right, all right, uncle! You're getting strong, you know that? Jeez! Look at you. What else is going on, huh? How's your girlfriend, what's her name? What girlfriend? Come on, you're really not gonna tell me again? Stop asking about girlfriends I don't have, I don't want, and I don't need. Right, right, fair enough. But you know you can talk to me about anything, right? Like how you're feelin'. Like if you're not sure of something or if you're disappointed in anything. You could tell me that stuff. Uh huh. So you're not any of those? You're not disappointed in like a pal or maybe one of your teachers or even your old man over here? You can tell me. Well. D'Amato sorta sucked yesterday. You're damn right he su... Darn, shit, shoot! Hey, forget that one, okay? Okay. Yeah, dum dum D'Amato blew that game didn't he? Yeah. Dum dum D'Amato. For crying outside. I got nobody, who'd you get? Jimmy Benshaw. Are you shittin' me, I mean kiddin' me? You got Jimmy Benshaw? You are a lucky duck, you know that? Trade you for your Bob Hoyt and your Derek Gordon? Oh, a two-fer again? Man, I don't know about that trade. I think you might be getting the best... The best of me on that one, huh? I'll let you know when we get back, how's that sound? Okay. Go ahead, pick you out a worm. Go ahead, I can't be worming your hooks for you forever. Does it hurt them? I don't think so. See the worms, they don't have the same nerve endings like we do. Worms you can tell, is just, they're just full of goo anyway. So the way I see it, we're kind of doing the worms a favor. You know, think about it, you wanna be crawling around in that muck your whole life? Or you wanna go out in a blaze of glory, like that worm that hooked your walleye last weekend. You see what I'm saying? Go ahead, grab the lucky winner. Oh, that's a good one. You got a good one, ooh. Alright, you got your hook? Get your hook. - Okay. - Okay. Just like me. Nice and easy. You put it on this part. That's right, right there in the top. Good, now you just drop it in the water. Better catch me a fish one day. Hey, see that was perfect. See you can do anything that you put your mind to, you know that? And don't you ever let anybody tell you otherwise. 'Cause anybody tells you otherwise, Is a bum. That's right, and there's a lot of bums out there, okay? Don't you forget about that. I'm gonna cast mine out and then do a little worm dance for good luck. Here we go. Little worm dance. Worm dance Worm dance Let's do the worm dance woo hoo All right, let's go. All right, go, ready? All right, here we go. Straighten up, straighten up, there you go. Nice and straight. Hold straight, all right. Are you your tippy toes? Right, stand still. Alright, let's move out of there. Are you shittin' me? Jeez louise, look at that! That's me at your age. You got over an inch on me already! We're gonna have to shrink you back down, you son of a buck! All right, here. Write your name up there. Finish up, and come help me out, alright? Hurry up, I need a hand. Some good elbow grease you got there, huh? Let's get these in here. Come on. Oh, look at that, champ. Wow, that's amazing what some people just throw in the trash, huh? You know what, if you use your mind you can always turn nothin' into something. Can we paint them next week? Darnit, can't we just? Paint's expensive, champ. Hey. Listen. Next time Menard's has that big paint sale, let's say you come with me and I'll let you pick out the paint, whatever color you want, huh? Sound good, all right? Well you walk around, you feel it out. Tell me what color you think you'd like. What color did they used to be? They used to be ivory white. The whole thing, real elegant. Ivory white! Yeah? Deal. This one? That's the one. Wayne, get your elbows off the table. Sit up straight! You keep slouching like that, I'll put a board down the back of your pants. What are you grinning at? Hey you wipe that smirk off your face, you... Go get me a beer! Go get me another beer! Go on, get! Hurry up. Ah, ah, hey, no. From the back, you lazy bum. I've been busting my butt at that mill all day. It's a thousand degrees in there, so when I come home, you get me the coldest beer you can find. You hear that? Hey, don't you make me come over there. I'm coming over there! You better wipe that grin off your face. Whoah, good one there, Ty. Wow, how about that, huh? Hey, you want another pop? No? What's wrong? My belly hurts. Oh, you know what, it's probably all that sugar you had. Here, stand up for a second. Come here, you all right? So it's your belly? Okay, maybe try doing what I do. Take a big, and you swallow it like a cheeseburger. Ooh, see, just like that, try that. Big gulp of air, then swallow it. Oh yeah, there you go. Feel better, is that better? Yeah. Attaboy. Good, come here. You gotta stay away from all that sugar, okay? Let's not drink so many pops next time. Okay. All right. See, my beers, they don't have sugar. Where's Buster? He's in there. You know I keep telling that lazy bum he's gotta clean his room. He can't. He's a fish. Hey you wanna help me change his water? Okay. All right. Uh oh, game's about to start. Tell you what. We'll give him this in just a minute but I gotta go down to the basement and get the popcorn. Take the elevator up! Elevator coming up! Watch out for the weird dude below the cupboard! There's not a weird du... oh! Oh, the weird dude's got me! Whoah! All right, wait wait wait, Tyler, no, no no! God dammit! Son of a! Shit, shit, shit! Shit! Hey, you can't go throwing water on an oil fire like that, okay? It just spreads it even more, you see that? Oh, hey. That is not your fault, champ. You were just trying to help out and I appreciate that. You know what, this is a learning experience. So it's my job to teach you about things like this, okay? It's a darn good learning experience, right? So it's a good thing that this happened, okay? Hey, so what do you say we just do chips instead, huh? Kramer checks and delivers the ball up. Nibbling a little bit here. Nibbling a little bit here against him. So Kramer, Wayne? Wayne? Huh, what? Tyler? Oh! Yeah, yeah, shh. Under here, under here, under here. Champ, under here. Yeah, I got, we'll be right there! Open the door! Okay, coming. Hey, Diedra, what are you doing here? It's 11 o'clock! What? No it's not. Get your shoes on! Oh, the winder. He didn't. Oh, really? Well that, well Tyler helped with the pop cans of course. Oh my god, what, was there a fire? Oh, just a little popcorn oil spill is all. It was just small one, right, champ? It wasn't big or anything. It was a learning experience. That's right. Get your stuff together and wait for me in the car. But it's so small! Now! Right, it was a really small fire. You don't call, I don't know what's happened. Right, I'm sorry, Dee. Hey, look, it was the clock, look! Save it for tomorrow. Oh come on, what are you doing? Your fish is dead. What? Ah, Buster. Judge: Mr. Stobierski, this isn't the first time we've been through this. And Mrs. Schmidt has every right to be concerned about your son's safety. Why? I don't do nothing to hurt him. It always starts with some kind of shenanigans. Shenanigans? And it turns into something worse. He was drinking heavily around Tyler. He was late for his curfew and I'm pretty sure he was driving drunk. Diedra! I'm right here. Why are you talking to her like I'm not here? Mr. Stobierski, please, just calm down. Sorry, I just, she's talking like I'm not even here and Johnny Lucky over there's got a smile on his face. How about I come over there and knock that smile off your face, it's not a joke! That's a threat, your honor. A threat, he's talking like I'm not even here! Wayne! One more outburst and I'll have you taken into custody for contempt, I won't have a choice. I'm sorry, Jenny. Judge, I just, she's talking like, I'm just feeling cornered right now. And this is all just because my stupid cuckoo clock stopped working. And the batteries... No it isn't. This is about a pattern of behavior. These are the results from your psychological examination. You suffer from alcoholism, minor but chronic depression, you have anger management issues. No I don't have anger issues! I'm not depressed. Your police record, aggravated assault, public intoxications, two OWis, indecent public exposure. Yeah, I thought that it was a men's room. And you thought that the sink looked like a urinal. The sinks were very low in that ladies' room. Very deceiving! Now. In the past, I've repeatedly turned down Mrs. Schimdt's requests for full custody to allow, on hardship grounds, a move to Arizona I've done this even though Mr. Schmidt's company offers full medical coverage for your son. Well, he just don't need it, he's a healthy kid. And I've done this because I've taken your rights as a responsible father into account. But at a certain point, as I've warned you, Mr. Stobierski, a lack of responsibility on your part diminishes those rights. Your rights as a father becomes secondary to the interests of your child. Therefore, the State of Wisconsin feels a change would be in everyone's best interests particularly your son's. Particularly my son's? Why don't we just ask my son? Let's ask him. I'll get him on the phone. Let's ask him. We can't expect a nine year old to know what's best. You have neglected your son's safety and endangered him on numerous occasions. Being such, the state orders that full custody of Tyler be turned over solely to his mother Mrs. Schmidt. You're granted permission to make all decisions on his behalf including where you choose to reside. Oh, thank God. Oh, shut up. Hey, you shut your mouth! Wayne! Wayne. Diedra? Dee, are you gonna say something, Dee? Now is the time. Diedra, can you say something?! Dee! Okay. You don't know me. I thought you did. None of yous know me. For Christ's sakes, you followin' me? You're not hard to find. What do you want, Dee? What else you gonna take? Wayne. What, what? Buy you a drink? Please go ahead, on me. I just wanna talk, please. No, take it. Take it all, Dee. Here, have a Jaeger. Dammit, Wayne. What, I'm done! I don't wanna talk, Dee. I'm done with the damn talkin'. Wayne. What? You're taking my son, Dee. That's what you're doing. Why? 'Cause you're a fuck-up. Okay. Look, it is what it is. But I... I wanna give you the chance to tell him. Tell him what? Tell him what, Dee? We're moving. No. Wayne. You're not movin', Dee. We know that you're not gonna go anywhere. Wayne. What?! Why, why would I tell him that? Why should I? 'Cause he's gonna be heartbroke, is why. And he needs to hear it from you that it's best for him. It ain't what's best. It is. It's going to be a good change. Change is good. There's nothing here for him once he grows up. I'm here, Diedra. I'm right here. You're gonna die. You're gonna die just like your dad died. It's best Tyler doesn't grow up to see that. If you care about him, you'll let him go instead of blaming me for takin' him. Either way. If you don't tell him, I will. Let me know what you decide. Okay. And Wayne. You can't keep fixing a house that's not yours anymore. I told you you needed a lawyer. Yeah and how the hell was I gonna pay for one? Jesus, Wayne. So when's all this supposed to happen? Listin' their damn house already. Change is good, she says. My ass! How am I gonna afford to get out to Phoenix more than once a year? I don't get to be his dad no more. Does Tyler know yet? God dammit! Jeez. It's all right. It's a nice shot. A three in one situation here as Valentine, he is not even swinging. He's just saying hey, throw me a strike and D'Amato has struggled to do so. Coming from the wind up, and guess what, folks. So Valentine's aboard. Siefer comes home with another run for St. Louis. And D'Amato, Can they still win? Of course they can. It ain't over 'til it's over. Ready for a Usingers, Ty? It's a brat. It's not just a brat. It's a Usingers! Best brats in the world. They haven't changed the secret ingredients in that sausage for a hundred years, 'cause a brat don't get any better than that. Yeah, don't change nothing 'cause change don't make things better. Did you know that the street where they make them are still made out of bricks just like in the horse and buggy days? Can we go? No, champ, that's all the way down in Milwaukee. Does everything good come from Milwaukee? The Packers are from Green Bay. But everything else. Beer, Bucks, Dusingers. Usingers. Well you know, you got an aunt and a cousin down there, Ty. I do? You sure do. And D'Amato starts... It's a strike! Right down the middle. Can we go, please? Get down there someday, champ. Okay. Look, maybe D'Amato's getting back a little confidence here. 0 and one. Hey Chuck, looks like Lorraine's having a great time. Oh, come on. Jeff's had the hots for Lorraine since fifth grade. It don't mean nothing. She married me. Chuck! Could you grab me a beer? Sure, okay. I just painted my nails. Hey, Lorraine. Those two stumps below your ass are what God gave you to move with. Screw you, Wayne. No thanks! Shut the fuck up, hey! I warned you, Buster. I see you're chasing with another And no there's nothing I can do I know that love comes with no guarantee But I believe the wind sets free We'll have a big old house with lots of rooms But the wind blows And all the dreams just slipped away Hey there Wayne. What do you got for me today? Well, Tom. I got all of them. You're kidding me. Nope. Not a nick on any of those, mint condition. Your Hank Aaron rookie and Roger Maris still in there? Yep, all in there. Sheesh. You getting married? You shittin' me? No, just take a look and give me a fair price, okay? Also, I need you to work your magic. I need two tickets for Milwaukee Chicago, first base line. Hey, hey, it don't matter what they cost. Saturday or Sunday you want? Make it Saturday. No, no, no, make it Sunday. No, no, no. You know what, it don't matter. Just give me the best seats you can find, okay? Take a look. Not a nick on any of those, mint condition. Hey, Dee. Thanks for coming. Sure. So. Waitress: Would you like a menu, Dee? Oh, no thanks, Bitsy. Wait, wait, wait, no. You love the pie here. Why don't you order a piece of pie? Because I don't have time. Oh, well to go then. Would you, on me? Okay. Yeah. A piece of key lime to go please. Got it. So, how's things at the hospital? Fine. Yeah? So did you decide? Are you gonna tell him or am I? No, you're right, I'll tell him. It should come from me. But I do have one favor to ask you in return. I was thinking, I was thinking that maybe I could keep Tyler for a weekend before you leave. Wayne. Look, I just, I wanna do something special for him. Okay, I wanna take him someplace that I know he's gonna... Wait, wait, wait. You wanna take him out of town? Well, yeah. But some place close by. You know, I was thinking that maybe Crescent Lake we could go to and we could do some camping and fishing and do like father-son stuff. I can't. Why? What, no? But you can. Come on, Dee. Look, all I'm asking for is a little extra time with my son, okay? I wanna give him something to remember me by. Dee, I'm begging you here. Don't. No, I just, I'm serious. I will pack the cooler with nothing but sodas, okay? No beer. I'm not gonna take any of that stuff, I swear to you! There's gonna be no brandy, no wine coolers. All right. What? Oh, Diedra, that's fantastic. On one condition. One condition, okay anything. I'm gonna need a chaperone. A what? What the hell are you talking about? - Wayne. - What? I can't worry myself sick all weekend. I can't do it anymore. Okay well, how the hell am I gonna find a chaperone? Ask Chuck. Chuck? Mhmm. You're saying you trust Chuck more than you trust me? Oh, don't sugarcoat it or anything. Fine, I will ask Chuck. You know, if I'm buying then Chuck's gonna be right next to me. Chuck it is, he's coming. I'm gonna need to hear it from him. Oh, give me a break, Dee. Can you give me a break? I will ask Chuck to be my, is he my chaperone or is he Tyler's chaperone? Wayne. I'll ask him to be the chaperone. You're still pulling a little right. How many times I gotta tell you, Lou? You gotta keep the same line. Hey, somebody traded beer cans with me and that one seems to be empty for some reason. Why don't you give me one more freshie and then we'll call it a night? On Chuck! All right. You gonna tell me what we're celebrating tonight? You're always in such a hurry, huh? You just gotta, you gotta slow down sometimes and smell the roses. God yeah, I wish that's what I was smellin. Oh, Chuckitty, Chuck Chuck, Chuckin', Chuckster! Wait, wait, Jesus Christ. I told you I hate that. You have no idea how lucky you are. You are in for a treat, friend. I mean a real big treat. Yeah, sure. So, first off, I'm taking Tyler to Milwaukee. What? When? This weekend. Diedra agreed to that? Yep, yep, yep. She sure did. Huh. I did sort of tell her I was going campin'. What? What the hell you do that for? Well because she would have said no for no good reason otherwise. Now listen to me. I don't know Wayne, it sounds like a bad idea that'd just end up bad. What? No, it's a good idea. I'm doing something special for him so he don't forget about me. He's not gonna forget you. Oh yeah? I can't remember nothing from that age except me sitting in front of the TV and my old man throwing his shoe at me for sitting too close. You know, I'm doing it. I'm taking him on this trip. You heard him. He said he wanted to go, so I'm taking him on a trip that he deserves. You know, I'm gonna show him what an ocean looks like before they take him out and stick him out in the middle of the frickin desert! Ocean? Yeah. Ocean? Milwaukee's on Lake Michigan last time I checked. Yeah, could you see clear across it last time you checked? No, you couldn't. Like an ocean. Just like I was sayin'. And hey, here's the best part. I got three tickets to a ballgame. Milwaukee Chicago, one of 'em has your name on it. Guess where they are. Front row, first baseline, no big deal. Oh. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you being my best friend so you're coming with us and I'm not gonna take no for an answer. Oh, I don't know. Not gonna take I don't know either! Ah jeez, Wayne. I've been a part of your failed missions before. What, goddamit, you're coming with me! I already told Tom to get us three tickets! Well what the hell'd you do that for? How the hell are you paying for all this anyway? Hey, don't you worry about that. You are gonna be my guest. All weekend, I got you covered. Jesus H! You got a secret pot farm or somethin'?

Okay, thank you. What?! Bosom bud? What, you are. I want you with us, Chuck. Yeah, 'cause you need a babysitter. Oh, now that's a crock of crap. Don't lie to me, Wayne. Got enough of that in my life. Hey I ain't lying to ya. I wanted you to go! Diedra wants you to go, everyone wants you to go, what's the matter with that? You can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that? What?

My sister kicked me out of my father's own goddamn funeral, in case you don't remember. You were plastered. Well see, I, I was in mourning, okay? She could have cut me a little slack. She did 'til you started running around with the pastor's wife's nylons on your head! That was a long time ago! Which is exactly what I told you yesterday. So drop it, hmm? Let bygones be bygone. Goddammit, Chuck. No, no, no, you goddamit! You lose your right to gripe when you puke all over the car and pass out cold! Sorry about that. Alicia. I just wanna thank you for letting us all stay.

That's a smart kid back there. Oh yeah. Look what you done. Smartie. Just like the ocean. Oh yeah. Smell that salt air. Well I didn't say it smelled like an ocean, I said it looks like an ocean. You see all those windows? You know behind every single one of those windows and all those buildings is somebody's home or office, there's all kinds of people up there doing all different kinds of things. Like over there, maybe like an office furniture salesman. Over there, a barber or something. Who knows, in there maybe a teacher. Do you think any of them are eating popcorn right now? Yeah, of course, why not? All those windows, probably somebody up there munching on some popcorn, huh? There's a lot going on in a big city, huh? Can you imagine living in a place like this? All the friends you could make, are you kidding me? Oh, you would have people just constantly ringing your doorbell. Hey, is Tyler home? Hey, can Tyler come out and play? Wouldn't be so bad, would it? I like my house. Yeah. It's a nice house your mom has there for you. Can you please tell me what is so fashionable about looking like a ghoul? Well, he's a teenager. At his age, I had a mullet. Matt! What?! Put that sketchbook down, you're on a boat! Come on, I remember you at that age. What? Wearing holes with a few threads of jeans attached to it. Air conditioning, we used to call it. Yup, air conditioning. I liked a few of them strategically placed air vents. You look real dumb. I won't after this thing capsizes. Don't come swimming over to me then. Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself. Are you all right? Yeah. Just trying not to drink. Come here. These are people's houses? Welcome to Whitefolks Bay, squirt. Whitefish Bay. They call it white folks bay 'cause everyone who lives here is white. So is everyone in my town. Except for my friend Katie. She got adopted. Whatever, squirt. I'm not a squirt. Anybody wanna guess who lives here? Some snot-nosed trust fund snob who eats pizza with a fork? No, no, this guy did it all himself and then some. This house... this house right here belongs to none other than the Gorman Thomas. What? Who the hell is Gordon Thomas? Gorman. Kidding me now? You never heard of Stormin' Gorman? You never heard of I could give a shit? Matt! Hey, Matt, no, Stormin' Gorman Thomas was the greatest center fielder who ever walked God's green earth and that's a fact. And he lives in that house right there. You know he's probably looking down on us from one of those big windows. Yeah, saying get the hell out of my driveway. Can we meet him? Please, please, please, please. No. Wayne. That would be a bad idea. What, why, no, why not? Why won't he come over and say a quick hello to some people who worship him? Why not? Because he's probably on the pot or making a BLT or trying to live his friggin' life. Okay, well then I say we get him off the pot. I know I would if a carload full of fans wanted to tell me how great I was. Yes! Yeah I wouldn't hold your breath there now. You know what, we're doin' it. Oh, no, Wayne. Oh yeah, we're doing it. Yes yes yes yes yes! Alica: Stop it. God, no, no, mom, mom, no. Oh god. Come on, come on, come on. Please please please? Hello? Hi, mister, Mister Thomas? Excuse me? It's Wayne Stobierski. I just wanted to let you know that there is a carload full of fans who would just love a chance to... Yeah yeah yeah. Sir, sir? Gorman Thomas hasn't lived here for 10 years. Oh! Okay, do you happen to know where he moved to by chance? Um, let me check. No, 'cause I don't keep tabs on him. Oh, okay. Now turn that piece of crap around. Hey, no need to be rude! Stick your pizza fork in your ear, you snob! - What did you say? - Yeah, you couldn't carry Gordon Thomas' sweaty jockstrap, you piece of shit! - Gorman! - Gorman. - Whatever. - Get out of here, he's gonna call the police. No, do it! Oh, ah! All right. Okay, just give a minute here. What's wrong with you? What? What is wrong with you? Nothing. It's just, ooh. Those little bums are fast! When's the last time you seen a doctor? Hmm, give me a break, look at me. What, are you kidding me? At our age you gotta get an annual physical. Chuck. I told him. Oh, baloney. Come on, look at this. I'm a frickin specimen, okay? Oh, yeah? All right, let me see something. Hold your hands out. Palms up. No, no, this way, come here. All right, let me just see something. All right, well your arteries don't feel too hard. But okay, let me see something else. All right, go like this, right. Now stick your tongue out and roll your eyes in the back of your head. Now you look as dumb as you are. I mean, come on, what do you think you get a bump on the head and it tells you you have high cholesterol? You gotta get your blood drawn. Did you know that I was this close to having diabetes II? And the doctor says just cut out potatoes and now I'm good. You gotta get your liver checked, Wayne. How much did that doc charge you to tell you to cut out the potatoes huh? I don't have the money for that, all right? Okay, okay, okay. Hey, how's Diedra? Is she still at the hospital? Yup, she doing good. How can she be good if she's in the hospital? She's a nurse, hello. How the hell am I supposed to know? I mean I haven't seen her since I was like nine. Diedra's my mom but she's not married to my dad. My mom's married to my stepdad. He wants us to move to Phoenix but we're not gonna. The Diamondbacks suck. Hey, I heard a rumor that you're going to see a baseball game with your dad tomorrow night. Is that true? Uh huh. Oh you lucky duck, huh? Nice. So you gonna tell me what's going on? Ah. Wayne lost custody. Diedra and Stu are moving to Arizona. Oh my god, when? As soon as the house sells. Tyler don't know yet. Wayne's supposed to tell him. Oh my god. Wow. How many people is that? That's something innit? Well you wait 'til tomorrow. Baseball game, stadium's gonna be full of people and you're gonna be right down there in the front row. No big deal. No big deal. Yup. Big city's kinda neat, huh? Uh huh. Could you imagine if you lived in a place like this? All the cool stuff that you could do? You know you can go to like a museum or go to the zoo. All the ballgames that you can go too. Can Matt come with us tomorrow? Yeah, I wish, but I just got tickets for you know, me, you and Chuck, so. But what I was saying about living in a city like this, Can Matt come up for my birthday then? No, he can't because he got school, okay? Will you listen? I'm trying to tell you somethin'. I...
