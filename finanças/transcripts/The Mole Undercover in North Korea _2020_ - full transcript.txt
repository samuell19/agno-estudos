You had a volunteer, ten years ago, saying he could infiltrate a North Korean Friendship group in Denmark. You said that wasn't really big enough for you to investigate, but you'd stay in contact and if it became bigger, then you could revisit it. It did. I used to work for the British security service, otherwise known as MI5, so the film team has asked me in to debrief you. He is a retired chef. Mm-hm. He resides in the suburbs of Copenhagen, together with his family. Do you happen to know if he's told his wife what he was doing? I don't think so. No? And, over those early years, your mole had progressed up the hierarchy of the North Korean Friendship Association until he was a position of influence in Europe and knew the head guy in Europe. Do you think Alejandro is dangerous? You brought in a fake businessman. He has to play the part of Mr James. And suddenly the North Koreans get very excited about the possibility of weapons trading, or drug smuggling, or whatever. And deals are cut, contracts are signed. So, what I want to think about is where does that leave us now? And did the Koreans have any preferences when it came to countries or suggestions? The mole speaks about how they are going to produce methamphetamine and weapons, and then Alejandro Cao de Benos says... DETECTOR BEEPS I knew, if something is going to happen here, it's over. BEEPING HE SCOFFS BEEPING CONTINUES CAR STARTS HE EXHALES What happened next? HE GROANS So, just to be fully clear here, he was fully briefed on the plans to build the secret factory in Uganda? Loved the idea. OK. Yeah. In Uganda, Mr James would be the playmaker. Yeah, OK. And to have it all on camera, he brought a photographer who was filming for a covert video about his life as a man of international mystery. And the mole, he brought his hidden camera. So, what happens next? Is that...? And who is he? NEWSCASTER: Earlier this month, North Korea threatened to fire missiles towards the US territory of Guam. This provoked the US president into threats of war. North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. LAUGHTER How had you found the island in the first place? LAUGHTER EXCITED CHATTER MAN: We are waiting for someone. Your sister? Your brother? MAN: I will show you one on the other side and then we are done, and then you have an idea of all the things. Did you get an impression that they had something out of the box, so they had done this before and had a standard plan, a standard look for disguising these sort of facilities? They had worked with other people like this? How can that be done? Was the government involved? We were really crazy as well. Thank you. APPLAUSE GROANING LAUGHTER THUMPING MUSIC PLAYS So, although the true purpose of the project was not revealed to the Africans, buying the island in Uganda and using it for a secret weapons and drug factory seemed to be right up the alley of the North Koreans, which was kind of important to prove. But it did not stop there because, while in Uganda, the North Korean arms dealer Mr Danny was ready to take the joint venture a step further. Yeah, we can meet in the lobby. North Koreans needing to move armaments to Syria is actually a very interesting piece of information, so please allow me to digress a little bit. Historically, North Korea and Syria have been friends for many years and the North Koreans were even building a nuclear reactor in the Syrian desert until the Israelis decided to blow it up. During the civil war in Syria, the New York Times published a story about how North Korea was helping the Syrian regime with its chemical weapons programme. At the same time, small arms from North Korea have been found in the hands of fighters from the Islamic State, but most likely these weapons were stolen from the Syrian army. So, when the North Korean arms dealer Mr Danny wants to send bombs and projectiles to Syria, the end user is probably the Syrian regime. So what did you say to Danny when he suggested that you help with the Syria move? Something I still feel bad about is sending Mr James to Beijing to meet with North Korean arms dealers. People who are in the know about the dark side advised us strongly against it. Because if the Chinese intelligence service would shine their lights on Mr James, it would be another ball game entirely. But Mr James is a man who craves action and I am a film-maker who craves sensation, so he went anyway. Both men are North Korean. I know this because sometimes they speak Korean to each other in the dialect of the North. Asking for names of clients and contacts in the world of arms dealing seems to be a show stopper. And what was the power dynamic between these two? Was the enigmatic Stoneface summoned to Beijing in order to verify the identity of Mr James? He never says a word, he does not even smile, so we can never know for sure about Stoneface, but it is safe to say that his appearance made a difference. Yeah. HE LAUGHS HE LAUGHS LOUDLY So, when did they contact you again? Hm. My actor, Mr James, seemed to be taking on a life of his own. That was a concern. Another concern was the mole going back to Spain to brief Alejandro Cao de Benos about the Tourism Project, the code name chosen for the underground weapons and drugs factory in Uganda. By now, the mole had been undercover for more than seven years and paranoia was running high. So far, no intelligence service had caught onto us, but, every time we met with Alejandro Cao de Benos, we had to consider the possibility that he was being followed by spooks. At the same time, we also had to consider the risk that Alejandro would upgrade his counter surveillance with new devices for discovering microphones. From now on, the mole would only meet with Alejandro in a hotel chosen by us with security on standby next door in case his cover was blown. Soon Alejandro would spring another surprise on the mole, but first a piece of nostalgia. You see, going to North Korea with Alejandro as my tour guide back in 2006 left a long-lasting impression on me. Apparently I had also left a long-lasting impression on Alejandro Cao de Benos and so had my first documentary about North Korea, The Red Chapel. The film stars two Danish-Korean comedians who go to Pyongyang and lampoon the leadership, which means that I am not Mr Popular in North Korea any more. HE SPEAKS ANOTHER LANGUAGE Sarcasm aside, Alejandro Cao de Benos is a man who thinks big. During the meeting in Barcelona, Alejandro tells the mole of an ambitious plan for a triangle deal involving Mr James, North Korea and a Jordanian businessman. Which is...? If the mole could get Mr James to Spain, Alejandro will introduce him to his plans for triangular trading. HE COUGHS AND LAUGHS Hmm. LAUGHTER So my two proxies, the mole and Mr James, went to Jordan to find out if there really is a man named El Dasouki who wants to triangle with them and North Korea. Have a nice day. BELL RINGS I guess that's the food. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. ANNIE: So was the contract actually signed? They signed the contract. For how much? NAME BLEEPED OUT Here, El Dasouki mentions a major Jordanian power broker, but, due to legal reasons, his name cannot be disclosed. Next, the mole was asked to go to Sweden because a package was waiting for him to be picked up at the North Korean embassy in Stockholm. Like my sort of movie! So... Thank you for the ride. Then, in this tale of intrigue and deception, a new character made his appearance. It was Mr Ju, a North Korean envoy who came to Copenhagen to do business with Mr James. Last time the world met Mr Ju was on the Australian version of 60 Minutes, where he acts as a smiling mouthpiece for the regime in Pyongyang. LAUGHTER And did Alejandro know about this deal as well? Now the North Koreans would discover that Denmark also is a very alcoholised country. Chin-chin! Had Mr James chosen to honour the contract he signed in Copenhagen, he would have to wire millions of dollars to El Dasouki in Jordan as payment for oil to North Korea. In return, North Korea would deliver manpower and products to the island of Mr James and so goes the triangle trade. From his office in Jordan, El Dasouki was now threatening legal action unless Mr James honoured their contract and showed him the money. Meanwhile, the North Korean weapons dealer, Mr Danny, who we met in Uganda, was pushing for a meeting with Mr James in order to "speed up" the business. They met in a hotel in Cambodia, where Mr James was taken to the next level in the circle of trust. GUNSHOTS In Cambodia, it became apparent that the sanctions are working. The North Koreans are desperate to find clients who will buy their weapons and it seems like Mr James is their big white hope. And what about the triangulation deal? Where's that left at the moment? So this is where you left it? Yeah. They still trust you. But not for long. The investigation had gone as far as it could, so Mr James had to disappear. Thanks to my intervention, Mr James went off the grid and simply vanished, no longer answering his phone nor his emails. In short, Mr James became a ghost. Meanwhile, the mole was taking care of business as the KFA delegate of Scandinavia. First, he went to London to protest against the BBC, together with his comrade in arms, the British delegate of the Korean Friendship Association, Mr Dermot Hodgson. Then the mole went to Spain for his last in-person meeting with his president, Alejandro Cao de Benos. Several items were on the agenda. And old carpets on the floor. But most important was the sudden disappearance of Mr James. To top it off, the mole had been chosen as the host of the annual KFA meeting. It was I who wrote the speeches for the mole and now he would deliver his final sermon. As I had planned it, the mole would share the fruits of the top-secret work he had been doing with his mentor Alejandro. Following the annual KFA meeting, one member of the Korean Friendship Association praised the Tourist Project on the message board of the KFA. Alejandro told the mole to delete everything at once. Also, a member named Jean Paul left the KFA because he panicked about spying and hacking. At the end of this, I hired the former intelligence officer Annie Machon. Before she went rogue and became a whistle-blower, she was working for the British security service, the MI5. Her exploits as a whistle-blower have made her controversial, but that is of no concern to me. I am only interested in her qualifications as a spy. Running long-time undercover agents was her line of work, as was debriefing agents at the end of their missions. If someone has put ten years of their life into doing something, and they've been very solitary in what they're doing, they do need a chance just to tell someone exactly what they went through. It's almost like a confessional. And, of course, you do want to, to reward them at the end of it, even if it's just with a recognition they can't really tell anyone about, apart from perhaps their wife or their husband. But it is that recognition that's very important when they've been working undercover for so long. Such as a lavish dinner? A lavish dinner usually works very well, yes. And I want to raise a toast to you both for what you have achieved. I think it's probably the... ..most impressive private intelligence operation I've ever heard of. How are you going to protect these two guys from any reprisals from the North Koreans? Regarding Mr James, he simply refuses to be... SHE LAUGHS ..you know...protected or advised about security. OK. Erm, we have prepared for an after-care programme for the mole, also taking care of his security. Mm-hm. And his family? And his family as well. Erm... What I am more concerned about regarding the mole is that being the mole has been a part of his identity for more than ten years, you know? So, what will happen when we bring him in? Entering any form of secret-type world is very seductive - I know from personal experience. And, for those who have been living a double life, with all the danger and the adrenaline rush and everything, it is incredibly difficult, often, to go back to mundane reality. In the long-run, we all must face reality. So, finally, I went to the suburbs of Copenhagen to see where the mole lives and meet with him and his wife. It is a long story, but let's cut to the ending. Mm-hm. HE EXHALES HE LAUGHS
