Josh, if you really want to fly, you need to focus- I'm preparing to land. Which direction is the wind coming from? East. Josh, what are you doing? You've wasted valuable time because you don't have a plan. This is the right choice, there's nothing upwind. Landing downwind is difficult. It was less than 10 knots, I would have made it. That was reacting, it's not a plan. Josh, I need to know you're gonna make the right decision every time. That takes a plan. I just can't recommend you for your flight test. What? What's the five types of air space? Class A through E. Where is A located? Above 18,000. 18,000 what? Feet. What kind of feet? I don't know, feet. Feet above what? Above sea level. 18,000 feet MSL. Above mean sea level. Don't forget it, or it's wrong. You didn't recommend him for the flight test? - No. - Why not? I put him in a tough situation. In fact, impossible. And he would have made it. He's a natural, the best I've ever seen. So why didn't you recommend him? I saw what you went through when your husband died. I want Josh to have the judgment to handle anything. You're not recommending him for the Academy. He's not getting trained for the CIA, like we were. Hey, is that your dog? You better keep him out of here or I'm gonna call animal control. I'm there now. We will go up to 30 million dollars. Just make sure we get the location that we talked about. I'm authorized to make the deal? Is this going to work? It has to. The CDC risk assessment came back. It's worse than we imagined. Porter, you're on. Okay, then I'm going in. Collins, wait here. You're not going in alone. If I show up with somebody they don't know, they'll spook. Stay here, unless you hear gunfire. Do we have a deal? 23 million is a lot of money. The place is okay, I will tell you the time. If the money transfer does not go through, the weapon will be released. Pen? You're getting a good plane. Good. I don't know how to say this but, you make me a better person. And I'm so thankful that you came into my life. Will you marry me? I don't think she's really your type. Are we ever gonna be buddies? Isn't there some kind of policy about workplace relationships? Section 23, article eight, paragraph B gives us clearance. If you really wanted to get along you could have recommended me for my flight test. You know I'm ready. Looks like we'll have to draw your friend down. You'll never find him. No, but he may want to find you. Time is valuable. We can't waste another moment, let's go! Josh, I have a message for you. Landon, say hello to your little friend. Josh, don't come up here man, you'll never make it out alive. Landon no! Don't let them? Listen to me! That's it. Enjoy your candlelight dinner! Okay! Landon! Let's go, the bomb's gonna blow up, let's go. - Push the button. - I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! You gotta do something man, come on! Landon. Get up bud, I'll be at your house in 10 minutes. Yeah, okay. Hey. What's goin' on dude, who was that? Come on, we gotta get. Why are we even chasing this guy, man? What's going on? You're done, you're definitely gettin' a ticket, man. Well your son here, he ran a red light. And, he was going 20 miles over the speed limit. And this one here, it's for reckless driving. Also looks like he's been fighting. Oddly enough, he wasn't drinking. Take care of yourself, young man. Be safe out there. Josh, your license, it's been suspended. Do you understand how serious this is? I can explain. I don't need any excuses. He's not your son. Let's get out of here. Josh is very responsible. Soccer? Yes. I understand him all right. I understand excuses. That's seriously bruised. Maybe a hairline fracture, but it's not broken. But for sure, no soccer. What? Josh has to play, he's half our offense. Well I'm sorry, but not today. A little friendly advice, next time think of your teammates before you do something so reckless. This is the first time in a decade we've been this close. If we win, we go on to state finals. Now let's get out there and bring this trophy home. Henderson on three, one two three. Henderson! As we all know, Henderson High was the heavy favorite to win it all this year. But it's not lookin' too good right now. Honestly folks, without their forward striker, Henderson's struggled all night. That little stunt of yours is costing us the championship. Henderson, Henderson, Henderson. One last chance, Kevin has the ball. He gets around one defender and loses it to Nicholas Ramsey, and that's the game. Conway moves on. Henderson High is out for this year's state finals. They came so close, but still so far away. I sure hope you have a plan for this team. I don't care if your forward striker is injured, how is my son gonna get a scholarship, if his team doesn't even make it to the state finals? Oh, cross your arms at me, what is your answer? You would have made the difference out there. You're the only one who thinks that. How's your knee. Oh, about that, I wanted to explain. Hold on. James has called an emergency meeting tonight and I have to go. Is this emergency meeting just you and Mister Military? No, it's something different. Okay. Well, hey I was wondering, can I go to Landon's house tonight? Yeah sure, but hey, be safe. You're everything to me. Love ya Mom. Love you. In that case, what about prom? Are you asking me? You think too much. I like to keep everything organized. Come on. Welcome to the Chesapeake Bay CIA Operations Center. Please provide identification. Identification positive. Welcome, Agent Lifestone. Retina, take me to underground 17. Voice recognition confirmed, elevator now commencing. Urgent tactical dispatch. All agents report to the war room. All agents report to the war room. All agents report to the war room. - I - just saw the assignment. I'm two blocks from the buy. Now hold on, everyone's guarding an escape route. Yours is just as important as the others. Right. Now don't get mad at me. This came down from Director Glasswell. Agent Porter has received a message from the terrorists. They want to meet at 1200 hours. Each of you now have a map of where you'll be located at during the buy. Once we've identified the bioweapons, I'll send everyone in. We'll shut down all the area networks. When the transfer from this phone goes all through our network, where the tracking virus will be attached. There is a dangerous weapon out there on American soil. Tomorrow morning everyone, be ready. I get Shaw. Come on man, you always get Shaw. No I do not. Well, I'm gonna win without him then. I don't know if you noticed bud but, you don't really win at anything. I'm messin' with you man. Lighten up. Show time. Agent Porter's in route. I've got eyes on him. They want me on the bus. The terrorists are trying to draw us out. Stay undercover, but don't you lose him. We're at the meet, he's making contact. You have the money? - I - need the location. It's outside the warehouse at Lafayette and Grey Street. Get me any security cameras near Lafayette and Gray Street. Porter, tell them to open the top, so we can see the control hub. Show me the control head. Show me the canister. Get me visual verification on the canister. All right, we have the visual feed. It's verified. Now the money. Something's wrong. Another area network just appeared. The weapon is more important, give them the money. We could lose everything. I can't shut down this network in time. The payment's been authorized. Put your routing numbers in here. This better go through. I'll keep the phone. Anything goes wrong, I'll put bullet through canister before you get there. What does your mom do? She's an accountant, I think. Sounds really fun. She works on a Saturday? Yeah, bureaucrats, who knows what constitutes an emergency? She probably starts her day by sitting behind her big desk. Then she probably pulls out her files, and then begins to input the numbers. I'm sure she gets her coffee so that she's got enough energy for the day. Don't do anything stupid. Okay, just relax. We got the 23 million. And now we get you for the insurance. Then, she probably starts crunching the numbers. 23 million? You think we're ignorant of the CIA? We got the money, we got the weapon. Careful, it may be armed. It's empty. Director Glasswell, the canister's empty. Are you working with Porter? Porter is nobody. We work with who we want to work with. Now, we work with you. After that, files all the reports. And that's her day at work. I'm sure it's, quite a job. Iris, call James Whitmore. Calling James Whitmore. Hi, this is James. Please leave a message. Wish I could do something like that. Yeah. Iris, call Josh. Calling Josh Morgan. Come on Josh, pick up. I really need to speak to you. Text Josh STINGRAY. Did you mean, Stingr? Give me the phone. Message sent. What did you do to him? Pause the game. If we still have the money, they'll have to renegotiate. They'll have to. We didn't get the trace. That was supposed to be impossible. Sir, the trace went through another server. Collins, stay on 'em until we get the canister. - I - have tryouts next week and these distractions just keep coming up. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I told you not to follow. Hold on one second. I'm not following you, back off. This guy thinks I'm following him, he's crazy. They have Lifestone. 30 million dollars, and a lost agent. Does somebody want to tell me what went wrong here? We're reviewing everything sir. They had to know our protocols to make the transfer work. I want Lifestone found. Whatever it takes. You need it, it's approved. I want her back alive and unharmed. Riely, find me that money. Talk to the NSA, get me that money. Porter, you're with Special Agent Whitmore. Let's go everybody, get me some answers. Yes sir. Okay people let's go. We've got an agent to find. Hey Mom, I'm home. Mom? Mister Whitmore. Josh, sit down. Who's Colt Lifestone? You are. Towards the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union made thousands of liters of biological weapons. There were stored in warehouses all across Russia. Over the last 30 years, we've been buying it up. Who's we? The CIA. Your parents worked for us. Your father was a great American hero. My Mom's an agent? Yeah. A buy went bad today. I don't know how to tell you this. Your Mom's missing. Does this mean anything to you? Josh, she texted you right at the moment that she was captured. This must mean something. I'm not gettin' anything, I don't think she ever said that or used that as a password. If you come up with anything, let me know. Your Mom's life could depend on it. Oh, Mister Whitmore, about that speeding ticket. Don't worry about that. We're past that. No no, I walked outside, someone was doing something underneath your vehicle. So I approached him, he hit and raced off. That's why we followed. This still works out. Everyone was supposed to get what they wanted while we got some of the money. They owe us that money. Man, I didn't see this going bad. We take care of the kid for a while. You feel remorse with what happened, and then resign. It's almost better this way. I'll have agent Dewitt Porter and his wife take you to a safe house until we get this all figured out. Are they both CIA too? No, only Mister Porter. Do you trust him? Yes. There is one more thing. Every agent writes a will, in case they're killed in active duty. I think it's time that you read your father's. My name is Charles Lifestone. I'm a special agent with the CIA. If you're reading this, it means I'm no longer here. Colt, if I don't get to tell you this in person, there's some things you need to know. A few years ago I led an operation that put our family in danger. Because of this we had to relocate and take on different names. Today we are gathered in celebration of the memory of Charles Lifestone. I'm sorry you had to grow up never really knowing who you are. There's so many questions that may go unanswered. But beyond time and space is a God that created you, who loves you. Jesus said, "This is eternal life." Just know this, wherever you go, you are not alone. Colt Lifestone, it's time to go. That's you. Let's go. No cell phones, computers, or anything traceable? Oh wait, one more thing. Oreo! I'm not leaving without Oreo. We're trying to protect you. Now get in the car. Get in the car. We're here. I hate Conway. Welcome to the club. I hate their soccer team. Come on. Here's some games, let me know if you need any others. I can play as much as I want? Yeah. And you can eat as much pizza as you want. Stinger. Stingray! I've made up my mind. I'm going to school. You can't. Why not? Because I won't let something happen to you. What she means is, you can't just walk into a new school. We have to file the paperwork with the local school districts. So you can transfer in quietly, without raising any red flags. On our wet list, these terrorists would be the top suspects. Thank you, MI6. Indeed. Agent Riely, We need to know where that weapon is. I'm uploading the footage from the security cameras to Retina right now. Agent Riely, let me know as soon as you have something. Calculating, please hold. Calculating, please hold. Calculating, please- Over 10,000 potential matches. Retina, could you narrow that down a little bit? Insufficient data collected. Lacking information, input detail. Input detail. So you're available at 10:36 a.m.? No, I'm helping Amber study for biology. Oh, well I could join you. I'm sorry, I really can't acquire any more academically challenged students. Oh well, you don't have to worry about that. At my last school I was like... That girl is something else. It's simple, just remember that homeostasis is a tendency of an organism or cell to regulate its internal conditions, usually by a system of feedback controls. It's just so hard. I wish it was just numbers and made sense. Amber, think of it as math. HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL: Josh Morgan? Could I speak with you for a moment? Your transcripts from Henderson just arrived. If you plan on graduating, you're going to have to work hard. Josh Morgan, what are you doing here? Just transferred. Did Henderson kick you out? Or were you just too afraid to show your face there after letting everyone down? Look at the new kid. Oh, I definitely have to go meet him. You mean, I have to go meet him. Ladies, let's invite him to our table for lunch. Yeah. My name is Kelly, but you can call me Kell for short. And I'm Sarah. You'll definitely want to hang out with us if you want to be popular at Conway. Hey ladies. I'm Sarah, I'm Kelly. Do they think about anything but themselves. Nope. I mean why are they hanging out with him anyway? So, what brought you to Conway? Well, it was my parents' job. Oh, where do they work? They work at an organization. What kind of an organization? One that's by the people, for the people, of the people. Why are guys always trying to be something they're not? I think it depends on how you- Are we talking about Nicholas? Or the new kid? Or guys I don't know? Seriously Jackson, do you have to even ask? Hey bruh? Hey. My man, let's hang out. Jackson! We'll have to go to your house. Yeah, I think we can make that work. Great. Fingerprint identification required. Access granted. My room's upstairs. Hey, I'm home. I got a friend with me. Oh, you made a new friend already? How nice. Can I talk to you for a moment? Alone? I'll be right up. First door on the right. What are you doing bringing someone here? It's a friend. If you want to keep going to school? You better not make any more friends. Okay. Your flight test is tomorrow. And if he's not out of here pronto, forget it. Ever played Stingray before? No. What's Stingray? It's a game about finding a corrupt agent. That's awesome. It's a game about finding... Stingray? Stingray? It's a game about finding a corrupt agent. Josh? You all right? Yeah. Hey, I got intel. Yeah he does. Intel, short for intelligence, information, news, new understanding. Yeah, all that stuff. That Josh kid is something else. Yeah, sure he is. No really, he has parents that threaten him not to make any more friends at school. And so on behalf of Havenhurst University, I am delighted to welcome former US Secretary of Defense, Doctor Alistair Walker. Thank you, thank you all. It is my honor to be here. Thank you so much for being with us. So let's get right to it, shall we? What was the most challenging moment in your career? Well, every moment's challenging when national security depends on your job. You may be surprised to hear it, but one of my biggest headaches actually came out of Cold War. The Cold War, well let's talk about the Cold War then. What can you tell us about the biological weapons that Russia developed during that time? Can I help you find something? I think I just found it. Then hypothetically speaking, if Russia still has weapons of that nature, what kind of damage could they do. We believe that with this particular biological agent, a single canister could kill nearly everyone in a major US city. And how long would it take for that biological agent to take effect? With an airborne release, hours. Doing some research? No, just studying chemistry. Bioweapons? Josh, what are you really doing at Conway? Okay, it's kind of complicated, but it really is because of my parents' work. I am really good at math, and none of this adds up. Hey, I might have stretched the truth a little bit yesterday, but I can be a good study partner if you give me a chance. And, I even brought some inspiration. How did you know? I have to confess, Jackson told me. You did an excellent job. Who was your instructor? It was James Whitmore. Hmm, I don't know him. But he must be good. That was the nicest check ride I've seen in years. Congratulations. That is your temporary certificate. You are now officially a private pilot. Excuse me, Mister Porter? I think I know what my mom was trying to tell Mister Whitmore with the text she sent me. What do you mean? I think she was trying to tell me there's a corrupt agent on the inside. Why would you think that? Well her message, 'stingr', is a reference to a video game that she knew I played. It's about finding a corrupt agent. Video games? I don't think so, we've got procedures for this kind of thing. But I love your imagination, though. Everyone please read pages 128 through 193 for next Thursday's class. What makes history great are the villains, the hooligans, and the heroes. Class dismissed. Jackson's mom always gives us way too much work and tests. I think she's a great teacher. I love her stories. Yeah. So what's with you hanging out with that new kid? I don't hang out with the new kid. I don't even like him. So he thinks there's a corrupt agent, that changes nothing. It changes everything. If they catch the terrorists, they'll find out about the money. Or, we just get rid of the kid. If I have- - Josh? There's been a security breach. You cannot leave the house until the threat has been eliminated. But I have a history test Friday, I have to go to school. The test is going to have to wait. We have to control the risk. That's time, please close your test booklets, and put your pencils down. Next week, we'll be looking at heroes in history. What is a hero? Anyone in the NFL? Movie stars. Ones that play superheroes. Talented people aren't necessarily heroes. What really makes a hero? Has anyone seen Josh today? No. Haven't seen him all morning. Okay, he doesn't even have a cell phone. That's cruel and unusual punishment. It's not punishment, it's just his parents. So you know his parents? Why I don't you go ask them? Hey Demi, wait up. This is so sweet, Jackson. I'll totally go to prom with you. Can't you read, no soliciting? I'm just here to see Josh. And you are? Alice Jones from school. Well, Alice Jones from school, Josh is sick. I thought you were sick? I need help. Well that, I already knew. I'm not the guy who you think I am. Josh, you're not the guy anybody thinks you are. My name Colt Lifestone. My mom works for the CIA. Seriously? Now we're gettin' somewhere. The Porters aren't my parents. Mister Porter's an agent, and Sheila is his wife. They're just watching me temporarily. What happened to your real parents? Well, my dad died when I was seven, and my mom went missing a few days ago in an op that went wrong. Wow. Wait is she? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Why don't you just leave this to the CIA? We can't. There's a corrupt agent on the inside. How do you know? My mom sent me a text, it's the last thing I received from her before she went missing. And I know that's what she was trying to tell me. And then you told the CIA? Well, I told Mister Porter, but he laughed at me. He thinks I'm an immature gamer. Wonder where he got that idea? Sorry. I might be on my own for this, but whether I am or not, I'm gonna find my mother. Josh, Colt, this is insane. There's no way you can outsmart the CIA and their resources. When I'm done tracking Colt, he won't give us the slip again. Just make sure that dog goes with him wherever he goes. No problem. Just make it real. Bad things happen when people don't follow the rules. Don't leave the house. Don't leave, or I'll- No! Look what you just did. Now we're going to need a new dog dish. Put the weapon down, Colt. It's not a toy. Oh that's real nice. Make sure you take care of that doggie. And don't shoot him. What's Oreo doing here? This is what my mom was texting special agent Whitmore when she was captured. I know it's a reference to a video game that I play. I was trying to tell the boss but, Whitmore's not taking any of my calls, I keep leaving messages but he's in siege mode right now. How are you gonna get his attention? Here, you take Oreo. You sure this is the place. Trust me, there's nothing as awkward as going on a date with your mom and her boyfriend. You don't forget it. Well, we can get into a lot of trouble for doing this. You said we have to get his attention. Come on. Put your hands right where I can see them. This is gonna be pretty hard to explain to my parents. How we're both smart like- Before you do anything to us, you need to call Special Agent Whitmore at the CIA, and tell him he's in violation of Section 23, Article 8, Paragraph B. I've never heard of that. I've never heard of it, either. Well, call Whitmore at the CIA, he'll know what we're talking about. Agent Riely, we've got a couple of teenagers outside Agent Whitmore's home. They say he's in some violation of code. I assure you we are doing everything in our power to find Lifestone. Sir, Collins caught two kids at your house. The young man said you are in violation of Section 23, Article 8, Paragraph B. Does he have a small dog with him? Yeah. Affirmative on the dog. I'll be right there. Excuse me sir, I've gotta take care of this. That's how we found out what "Stingr" meant. Did you tell anybody else about this? Nope, yes I told Agent Porter about it. That's strange, he's never said anything to me about it. So, any updates on finding Mom? No, nothing at this time. Colt, I want to thank you for finding that tracking device on my car. Do you know, we had six of our vehicles with that very same device on it. It was a big break in the case. Thanks. I know that you might not always answer these CIA questions but, now that I know my mom is an agent, where was she when she got captured? You know the address is classified information. Don't get any crazy ideas. Colt, if you want to contact me, here's my card. Alice, it was a pleasure meeting you. Same to you, Mister Whitmore. Take care now. Okay, so now we know where the buy went down, we have to go see it for ourselves. I'm sorry, I can't. I already have plans for tonight. Maybe Jackson can take you? Jackson, there's some things about me that you should know. I'm not Josh Morgan. My parents are CIA agents. My dad is dead and my mom got captured, right here. That's why I asked you to bring me here. So over here it's talking about positive feedbacks, and negative feedbacks, and what they do. What's up? Hey, Oreo found this yesterday at the building where my mom was kidnapped. What do you think it means. I looked into it, it looks like it belongs to a flight school that's about 35 miles from here. I have no way to get there, but... So this isn't about me, it's about a free ride. When? Could we go now? Hey, have you guys bought or sold any planes recently? We're actually a flight school. I know, but the website said that you guys buy and sell airplanes. Oh, well if you're looking to buy or sell an airplane, you're gonna have to talk to Marty. He does all of our sales. Okay, and where's Marty? Marty's not here today. Can I help you with something else? No, I don't think so, thank you. Colt! Look what I found. Isn't it just like the one that you found? It's the same kind. They've been here for sure. I'm gonna make sure the coast is clear. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay, come on. I want to be an agent. Mister Porter, you're so cool, and I know you could teach me how. It takes serious dedication and hard work. You have to really care about your country. Well, I guess that means I'll have to start working out with you then. And, I guess that means I'll start with letting some fresh air in as well. Colt, you can't just become an agent. Well, I could try. I mean, how many years of working out does it take to get there? Five, ten, fifteen, twenty? So, how many reps on this one can you do? I know exactly what you're doing. You do? You're trying to get on my good side, because you want something. Okay, you got me. It's almost cloned. So, what is it? Well, I was wondering if you would be so kind, as to let me use the car so I could go to prom? You wouldn't make a good agent, Colt. I was expecting something much more. So that's a yes on the car, then? We have the weapon, and the plane. This is her phone. Enable tracking again. Give the CIA something to keep them occupied. And we will still have abandoned police building. Woops. There's always tomorrow. Okay, so this is what we found. Missus Porter was sending him texts the day the buy went down, but, since she's not an agent, what are these texts about? I'm here now. Missus Jones? Yes. Wait, hey? Special Agent Sheila Porter with the CIA. CIA? What's going on here? I'm here to talk to you about a young man by the name of Josh Morgan, that your daughter is seeing? It's a very dangerous situation. The area is clear. We've got it. We've got the phone. I'm uploading the data now. Good work, Agent Phariss. We told you not to pursue. Or Agent Lifestone is history. Alice, we need to talk. Oh, did I forget your sleeping pills again? No, it's not about sleeping pills. Are you seeing that new boy, Josh? How many millions? Lots and lots on money. Millions. We are going to have a blissful life. I want to go everywhere. Anywhere and everywhere and, More than once, more than twice. Hey Alice, I know what we need to do next. I'm sorry, I can't be involved. You're on your own. No no, he's right here. Colt? This is for you. Hello? Colt, this is Neil Glasswell, Director of the CIA. There's something I need to tell you. We have reason to believe that your mother is dead. I'm so sorry. Bro, you okay? I'm just trying to figure out what to do with my life. Colt, relationships give us purpose. The greatest purpose comes from the greatest relationships. And that's a relationship with the God who loves you. Hey Angel, how was the prom? It was awful. I went with the wrong guy, Dad. Come here. And Nicholas flirted with Kelly all night long. You really like Josh, don't you? But it's an impossible situation. I'm sorry, but we really need to work with Agent Porter on this. I don't think we can trust him. You mean her? Sheila Porter? She's not an agent. Oh. They want me on the bus. They owe us that money. Put your routing numbers in here. We'll take care of the kid for a while. You'll feel remorse with what happens, and then resign. It's almost better this way. It changes everything. - If they catch the terrorists, they'll find out about the money. How many millions? Millions, and millions. And millions. We are going to have a blissful life. I want to go everywhere. Anywhere and everywhere. And more than once. More than twice. So? That mutt's been in a lot of places, including Whitmore's house and where the buy went down. It's time to get rid of the kid. Josh? Colt, I have to tell you something. I get it, you're with Nicholas. You don't get anything. None of it matters now. Yes it does. What's going on here? So it appears Missus Porter was directing him to get on the bus right here. What do you think she was doing? I don't know, but whatever it was, I don't think it has anything to do with the CIA. I think we need to call Whitmore. He needs to know about this. Can I use your phone? Okay, yep. Yeah, Agent Porter's been with us a long time. Sheila Porter got him onto that bus for a reason. It must have had something to do with the buy. If they reprogrammed the phone, that would explain a lot of things. Something must have happened on that bus. Be careful, this doesn't sound right. Also, Mister Whitmore, while I've got you on the line, I've been looking into this airport, I think I have the connection to the terrorists. If you want to bring your spy team together I can brief them on what - I've already found. - Conferencing with The Director. They need you on the line. Okay, Colt I gotta go, I got a meeting. Be careful there. But but, I. I think that airport has something to do with this. The weapon is more effective if it's released airborne. Doctor Walker, if I may, who was the most valuable informant during your time of service? I'm afraid the best agent to help you already gave his life for his country. Charles Lifestone died trying to stop these terrorist attacks. When you find that weapon, be certain he is honored for it. Mister Secretary, you have my word. Hey, is Marty in today? Yeah, he's right over there. Excuse me, are you Marty? Has anyone bought a plane recently? Three guys just bought the airplane in the blue hangar, three days ago. Come on, let's go check it out. Let's go around back. Okay. We'll fly over the city tonight. Rashid, he shall watch the plane while we eat. Rashid do what Rashid want to do. Watch the plane while you eat. We've gotta call Whitmore. Well, the GPS used up all the battery on my cell. Well now's our best chance, we've got to do something, they have the weapon. Hey, I picked up my mom's sleeping pills today. Just try to get out before he gets back, okay? Okay. Oreo, go fetch. Hey, hey! What are you doing here? You stay away! Stay away! Go! Go! I can't believe it, we did it. Okay okay okay. Just take a drink. Oh come on, just take a drink. Yes! Yes. Okay, now how long before your mom falls asleep? Well she usually takes one, so I gave him four. Let's go. Here, take him. Colt, what are you doing? He could wake up. If he has a phone, I might be able to find my mom. Okay, will you just hurry? This could be my only chance. I got it, but it's locked. Try his fingerprint. Okay, I've got it. Rashid! Rashid! They killed him! Okay, we've gotta leave. What, you don't have a driver's license, but you can fly a plane? Okay, I might have exaggerated about my grades a little bit, but I really do know how to fly. But. Yeah. Here, get in, come on. Don't shoot, don't shoot, or we lose the weapon. They're stealing our plane. Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray is being stolen, by children. They're not even real pilots. Hang on, we're going for a ride. Go go go, now! Okay, check his phone, look for any selfies and then text those to Whitmore if you find any. What do I tell him? Tell him these are the bad guys. Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray you are not cleared for takeoff. Repeat, do not take off. The CIA will be calling any minute. Tell them I have the canister, and I'm headed for Langley. Cessna 7-3-9 Hotel X-ray you are in violation of FAA regulations. Your license will be suspended, and you will be arrested upon landing. What's wrong? The account's frozen. You sure it's not the connection? They patched into the account. They know. I knew it! That Colt! Everybody okay down there? They're flying north. In 20 minutes they'll be close enough to the city to detonate. Director Glasswell, she's alive! We'll have a medical update shortly. All right, keep me updated with any new developments. I love swash and buckle! Give me that. It's swashbuckle. She's weak but she's responsive. Okay. How did you find me? Colt found you. Colt? My Colt? Yeah. The medical team will be here soon. She's gonna make it. Thank God. I didn't think he was serious. There's no way we can outmaneuver them. Let's hope Whitmore gets through to them in time! Colt Lifestone, this is Colonel Ramsey. I'm a friend of your father's. We're here to escort you to Langley. Thank you, sir. Do you have the bio weapon onboard? Yes, we do. Are the glass tubes green? That's affirmative. Good, they can't control it from the ground. You should be okay. Detonate it now! Wait. He needs to be closer. Colt, it's red. Here, you've gotta fly for a minute. What are you doing? There's a cell phone detonator, I've gotta deal with this. What's going on in there? It's red. Tell Colt not to touch it. Do it now! My friend is dying, I must have plane to airlift him immediately. Okay, let me call an ambulance. I really think that's gonna be your best bet. He is dying! Sir, a gun like that is against our security policy! Okay, you two create a distraction. I'll go around and come in from the ramp entrance. Give me the keys to that Cessna 310 there. Okay, you know what? You're gonna need to calm down. Is that thing real? Okay, I cannot rent it to you until you get some flight training experience with Marty. Hey! CIA, you're arrest. Put your weapon down, put your hands on top of your head. What is that noise, what is that? How well can you swim? Slowly exit the aircraft, keep your hands in the air, and don't make any sudden movements. My name is Colt Lifestone, I have a dangerous weapon onboard. Welcome to Langley Air Force Base. Director Glasswell, we have the bomb. It's a Yakov22. Secure it for transport. I need your palm, I'm checking for contamination, sir. You're cleared. Ma'am, I need your palm. Mom? Mom! I'm so glad you're okay. There's someone I want you to meet. Mister Whitmore was telling me about her. Her name is Alice. By the way Mom, what's your real name anyways? So class, I'd like to close this section by reading a poem. "Heroes use their talents every day, and people seldom know their name. It's difficult work with simple pay. It rarely leads to fame. When trials come, it makes them strong, and they fight on in trouble's face, where work is hard and days are long, to make the world a better place. Here this call from a faithful voice, yet even in the darkest night, we can all be heroes with a choice, when we choose to do what's right." Yeah, about that. Sorry I never got back with you. What's going on man? Where you been? Okay Landon, I can explain everything. You just gotta realize some things have changed. All right well, whenever you get back from your journey, or vacation. Whatever you're on. Guess we got some catchin' up to do. I was hoping for a second change at prom. What now? Does everything go back to normal? I'm always gonna be the Colt Lifestone that cares about you. I promise. I worked out a small reward for your service to our country. You get 30 minutes, or a full tank of fuel. Colonel Armstrong will be your copilot. Come on Skydog, let's fly!
