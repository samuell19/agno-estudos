BASED ON THE NOVEL BY BORIS VIAN Go on, now. Let me work. -Chick! -Alise! Did I hurt you? Oh, I'm sorry. Let me see. OK. I don't want your piece of paper. No! Come on. Don't be stupid. Don't come closer or I'll jump! Come down. You're giving me vertigo. I think I have that, too. Don't look down. I can't help myself. What's your name? Alise. Alise, don't move! You hear me? The paper you took from the trash, that was a draft of Partre, right? Yes. You like Partre? I only like Partre. I'll never like anyone else. I'm ready to die for him. Alise, if you come down from there, I'll give you all I have that Partre's written and even… the ends of pencils he wrote with. -You go through his trash, too? -Yes. Come on. Let me show you my collection. You're not getting this one. I feel so limp. I'm empty. Do you realize what you're doing? Are you crazy? You can't treat me like that. This is your fault, too! Bad girl. Hangnail. -You really have a collection? -Sure do. How do I know you're telling the truth? Don't start. I haven't had the time to get the bound. It's expensive. At first… I thought I'd get them all bound the same way. With laminated Mauriac leather. Yes. Here, feel this one. It's Paschal lamb. This is aged Zinzolette leather. Iguana pleura, treated with thuja wood. Would Colin like some chocolate? Colin must be tired. It was a cold night. You shouldn't stay out here on the stairs. Come on. Say, Nicolas, the girl you called Alise, who is she? I said "Alise"? Maybe I misheard. I do think I heard myself say "Alise", but I don't see why I would have. A memory. She was 33 pounds. I de-feathered her for you. Her feathers were so soft. Allow me, ma'am. That's all right, sir. Am I walking too quickly? Don't worry about me. Take my arm. You'll be more under the umbrella that way. Oh, thank you. People are rarely nice to us. Here we are. I don't know how to thank you. You're welcome, ma'am. I'd better be on my way. I've got a lunch date. Sir? I don't know what I was thinking! Take my umbrella. Thank you, ma'am. Bye. Bye. What are you looking for? That depends. I haven't decided. Of course. Well, pretend to keep looking. So you found it! Found what? You're a Partre fan? Should have said so, my boy. I'm not a groupie. That's his left index. A rarity. So… Let's not beat around the bush. How much do you want? I've got something better! -That was his? -Guaranteed. How much? Make me an offer. I'm a little tight right now unless you can give me credit. It's like new. Real silk. Swedish steel ribs. And bamboo… -handle. -For what? The boxers. The suspenders. The left index? OK. Thank you. Stop by again. I'm expecting a pipe and glasses. That smells good. Hello, Chick. I think you're going to like this. I put in Antelope bacon, Gabon-style. And young lady prunes, sauce madame, all topped with police cream. Can we taste? I haven't added the laburnum syrup yet. Or I could put candied screwball. Chick, can you pass me the Gouffé? I can't stop turning. Are you going to cook without your manual? Age quod agis. My view is that when in doubt, it's better to check the dictionary. I only read Partre. What do you say? The page is marked. Third paragraph, third line. Nicolas, do you have a niece? She's pretty, right? She was chasing after you this morning. Candied screwball or Mandiargues baked in foil. Oh, silly me! Some mortadella juice will work fine. Chick, could you tell Colin that lunch will be ready soon? Who was the girl? Which one? The one chasing after you. Oh, Nicolas's niece. You could have introduced me. She's a Partre fanatic. Can you believe it? Lucky you. What do you think of my pianocktail? Not bad! Sounds like Ellington. Here. Shake it up. I haven't found a way to make it do that part. Taste. It needs a little ice. What is it? Here. Can I try? I haven't quite got the hang of it. Alise is a really great girl. Are you hungry? Nicolas… I was just about to say that lunch is ready. What are you doing here, Nicolas? Don't you have a date with Isis? Thanks for reminding me. Is Colin sad? Is he tired? He worked on his pianocktail too hard. Ah, it's a nice thing. Colin should have some soup. It would do him good. Colin's going to sleep well tonight! Tomorrow he'll have figured out a solution for his pianocktail. Here, a spoonful for me. A spoonful for Nicolas. If Colin isn't hungry, then Nicolas has no reason to be here. Nicolas is leaving. Nicolas is leaving! Is that what Colin wants? Colin's pouting. Look at him pout! Look how naughty and mean he is! You don't want your soup? Well, then, here! And the plate, too! And the tray, why not? I'm fed up! You're pigheaded! Hypocrite! I'm the hypocrite? Yes. Colin is calling Nicolas a hypocrite. And he's not backing down. He even adds "dirty two-face", "bastard", and "traitor"! Well, that's quite upsetting. If anyone has the right to be upset, it's me. Poor Nicolas. I'd never believed you'd do this. What the hell did I do? -Nicolas? -Excuse me, sir. I don't put much weight in that. Whether I am or not, it's the same. I can leave if you'd prefer. What do you care? I'm never informed of anything. Everyone hides everything from me. I count for nothing. But… Honestly, Nicolas, you're too old. -I'm sick of being insulted. -I'm the one they insult. Everyone knows you have a niece named Alise. Except me. It's time for Colin's walk. I found a nice little river. It's very pretty, with willows and poplars. You're going to love it. Colin is wrong to think about my niece. How do you know I think about her? You shouldn't. Your friend Chick saw her first. I'm dying to be in love. There's no lack of pretty girls. Sure, but they don't look like Alise. Does Colin want me to give him a piece of Isis? That's very kind, but I know her parents too well. Isis has a very nice butt. As white as silk. -And as soft as poppies. -Quiet! Isis has small breasts and big owl eyes. That's her, Nicolas. She's the one I'm going to marry. Perhaps you should talk to her about it. What should I say? That you'd like to marry her. Oh no! Go tell her for me. Come on. Help me. Colin is a big boy now. It's your job to tell her. You can be so self-centered sometimes! I'll try to neutralize things. Sing, children. This unlucky man just fell. Are you hurt, brother? Oh yes, sister. Hello, Mr. Courbet. Careful. I'm Isis. I'm Alise. My name's Chloe. She's so pale! This is the first time. You've got to start someday. What will they think of me in the convent? They'll die of jealousy. No. No lipstick. Not too much. Let's spruce things up. You really need to marry her? You don't think she's pretty? Alise is pretty, too. I wanted to talk to you about that. Listen… I'm on a great lead. His pipe. Yes, sir. Partre's pipe. You don't even care about my wedding. Can't we talk about something else? Drink. You look beautiful, niece. And Ms. Ponteauzanne as well, if I may. You can call me Isis. This is half of what I have left. Marry Alise, man, please. You'll see. We'll be happy. What are they doing? Working. -What for? It seems odd. -It's pretty well paid. They don't like us. Let's leave. They're working. That's not a good reason. Kiss me. It's not so good to work. They were told it was. Nobody thinks it. They just do it out of habit. -It prevents them from thinking. -About what? About laziness. About love. Look, it's Chloe. My God, your feet! They're in Barcelona. Do you really think Colin is all that rich? -Why? -I don't know. He sure spends a lot. That'll teach you! I told you never to set foot here again! Did you see that? I'm pressing charges this time. -Shall I take it? -No, no. Otherwise, no one will believe me. I'll pay it by money order. You'd better! Otherwise… Bastard. You didn't steal it! Don't worry. I've got an idea. I've got him this time! My God, your feet! Perhaps I should hire a secretary to organize all this. -Where did you put his pipe? -I sold it. Are you nuts? You know I don't like people going through my things. The pipe? My legs. The pipe? My lips. The pipe for my marriage. Who do you want to marry? You, Chick. Colin gave him money And he spent the money Sea foam, burnished with the ocean spray of Sali. Bite marks, characteristic of a pensive, perhaps tense molars. Chloe's not doing well. Chloe's pretty. She's caught a cold. They're coming back soon. It's snowing in Barcelona! Can you believe it? Where will we go for our honeymoon? Do you love me, Chick? What's this? What? Your boxers! Oh. It was a great deal. How much? I couldn't pass them up. You'd have bought them, too. Plus, it was a bonus. It was a bonus for buying the… the bindings. Here's the receipt. One pair of flowered boxers belonging to Jean-Sol Partre, size 45. Fifty thousand. Chick? I… I couldn't decide between these and… the suspenders. It's horrible, Alise. I'll never have everything. Never. Prices are going up. Going up… Endlessly. -Colin! -Isis! Hey. You look great, Chloe. I thought you were sick. Nicolas and Colin took me to a doctor. -How was Barcelona? -Wonderful. How are you, Isis? -Did you go swimming in Barcelona? -Colin! -Wait! -Colin! Chick! So, what are we doing? I want to do all kinds of things. What if we went… To the match? -Does that sound good? -What do you think? I'd like to buy some sheets. Yellow ones and red ones and green and white and sunflowers… I'll go with them. I have some shopping to do. Let's go. Occupied! Occupied! -You think he'll take us? -I have a requisition order. -Here it is. -Get in. Forty to zero! New grenade. He'll never make it. No! Bertrand's serve. How are things with Alise? Good. When are you getting married? We're working on it, but it's not easy. You need so many papers. Domingo is victorious. Are they always drawn at random? Yes. The periods are going to be 12 months. From Nicolas to Colin. From Nicolas to Colin. Chloe has fainted. Chloe has fainted. Have a seat, young man. Four times four… Hundred and sixty beats, young man! Calm down. My wife fainted. That's no reason to kill yourself. Stand up. Your wife fainted? Explain. -That's all I know. -That's not much. Has she been nauseous? No, but sometimes she coughs. Sometimes? -Is she young. -Yes. -Pretty? -Very. So what are you complaining about? I'm not complaining. I'm concerned. Look. This is mine. -Your…? -My wife. Everyone always laughs. I don't know… -I apologize. -It's fine. You're not the first. Everyone thinks women need to be pretty. But… This is my house. So? I'm dying to see a pretty woman. How is she? Better, much better. No reason to worry. Where is the patient? No, you might upset her. You can see her afterwards. -I've prepared a vitamin concentrate. -So? Screw your vitamins. With or without water? Dry. She was coughing in Barcelona. Is there any ice? No, the fridge has stopped working. What do you think she has? Apparently, this doctor's very good. Isis recommended him. Good idea. I'd have one. What can I do for you gentlemen? I'll have them ready at six. We're in a bit of a hurry? I can make this up while you wait. There's no way to know with these guys. Do they know? What do you think? You think it's serious. Who knows these days. I made you wait. No matter. No, it matters. It's for my reputation. What is this? H20-S04H2. Phylloxera powder, frog milt with porto blanc, dilutant, and vanilla sugar. What is this for? Depends on the case. All I can say is that any ordinary plant wouldn't last long with this. -How much do I owe you? -Three hundred and fifty thousand. That's a lot. REGISTER -Do you have insurance? -No. -One-income household? -No. -Benefits? -No. -A father killed in the war? -No. -A brother who died for the flag? -No. -Two? -No. If I were you, I'd speak to my representative. To your health. See you soon. -Say, Chick. -What? How much of the 25,000 I gave you is left? Well, I bought a lot of stuff. Yeah? Like what? Oh, some Partre. I hit on two manuscripts last week. And Alise? Is it time you decided to marry her? Yes. Of course. I mean, she's happy now. Is money the problem? How much do you have left? You must have 20,000 doublezons left, right? Isn't that enough to get married? You're not the only one with money problems, you know. -I know. -So? I have 5,000 doublezons left. Are you kidding? What do you want? That's life. No, Chick. That's not life. Yeah… That's what I thought. Don't breathe. What is it, Doctor? Get dressed. What is it, Doctor? You saw what I saw. A waterlily. Is it serious? So… Make sure you put flowers in her room. As many as possible, preferably waterlilies. Why? Because they irritate their friend. We have to play on the antagonism of flora here. So. Obviously, no water. You see why. No. Do you know what happens to a flower deprived of water? It's simple. So she needs to drink very little. That is, nothing at all. Say… Two teaspoons per day. What do you do for a living? Above all, make sure she doesn't drink the flowers' water. That kind of negligence can compromise everything. We'll stay on guard day and night. Of course, but… You might fall asleep. It'd be better… This is the best idea. Put some rubber foam in here. You can find it in any good pharmacy. Two pairs should be enough. Right leg and left hand, for example. Switch diagonals every day. Left, right, right, left. And that's it. Let's try to pick this flower. You wouldn't believe how thirsty I am. Come on. Try to sleep. I can't. It burns. Just one sip, Colin. You should rest. Don't worry. If I fall asleep, I'm sure you'll drink the water. You can't watch over me all night. You're exhausted. Colin needs to rest so he can help Chloe get better. Chloe needs to sleep so that Colin can rest. Chloe can't sleep. That's not good! Colin is upset. Chloe is too temperamental. Handcuff me. Then I'll be good. I won't drink. And you can rest. No. I can't. I'd rather you drink a little. But just a drop. Promise? It's not good to disobey the doctor, Colin. -Handcuff me. -Chloe, please. It's not nice to ask me to do stuff like that. To make me suffer. Nicolas! Nicolas, stay with her. I can't. I'm not strong enough. I'll let her drink. Don't go. I want to spend the night with you. Handcuff me, Nicolas. That's not a nice request. Do it for me, Nicolas. For Colin. Leave her alone! Or I'll never speak to you again. Colin's going to go to sleep. Nicolas is Colin's friend. He'll watch over Chloe. Nicolas is going to tell Chloe nice stories. He's so good at that. Do what he says if you don't want me to escape. OK. Next! -Name? -Sorry? OK. It's… Not bad, huh? Can I buy you a drink? -I have to go home. -I'll come with you. I'd like to make love with you. With me? Always with you. In black stockings and lace. Piles of velvet, chandeliers… You should have told me you needed money. I'll talk to Dad. He has a bank that does nothing. It always does this the first time. Here. Have a mint. That'll help. Thanks. All right, my boy. Goodnight. Don't forget. Even if you're scared, don't sing. -How is she? -She just fell asleep. How's work? Dad's bank? Tell Chloe I… I'll be back at five. See, I'm going. Fine. Beat it! That's right, I'm leaving right now. Oh, before I forget. The money for the pianocktail. I sure hate waterlilies. No one's making you. I don't know what's wrong with me. You think I'm a bastard? -Say it. -Me? I don't blame you. Live your life, Nicolas. You're not young anymore. You don't have to buy, sir. The demonstration is free. This is the first turbo-reactor germ vacuum guaranteed in 12 minutes. Do you think she has a chance? Let's go for a walk. Hang on. What if we went on a trip? You know I can't. Why not? Isis can look after Chloe. We haven't gone away in a long time, don't you think? Yeah, it's true. I don't know, though. I feel empty. We could go to the museums. We'd drink dark beer and go salmon-fishing. We'd fight a revolution. Throw bombs under trucks. We could go to Ireland. -Sure. -Or someplace else. -Anywhere. -Just not here. Nope. I liked it here. It's not bad. We shouldn't have left. Isn't this the Ponteauzanne's place? Oh, I didn't recognize it. Nicolas? Isis? Chloe! Chick! Alise! Mom. Mom. Mom? They're going to fire me. Eat something. You'll feel better. How is she? Her waterlily is getting bigger. You can see it through her chest now. It's neon blue. They fired me. Me too. Chick doesn't want to see me anymore because he's broke. Why did he leave me? I was really pretty. I don't know. I like your hair. Your face. Look. -Can I kiss you? -Yes. I like you. All this money stuff is so silly. -I don't want you to be sad. -That's nice of you. But I am sad. I'm going to go see Chick. I can't go there anymore. It's always locked. I'll see him anyway. -Or he'll come see me. -No, I doubt it. He's not the same. Sure he is. People don't just change. It's things that change. I don't know. Why didn't I meet you first? I'd have loved you just as much. But now I can't. I love him. I know. I love Chloe more, too, now. CONFERENCE OF JEAN-SOL PARTRE There is a time to eat. There is a time to sleep. There is a time to follow. But the time has come to precede. Between the river and the plain. Between the water and the crop, there is the damn. There is a time for war! And a time for peace! And a time to speak! And a time to die! Mr. Jean, don't open the gas. Don't put the pipe in your mouth, Mr. Jean! Mr. Jean. I have to work. For the last time, you're going to kill yourself. It's not my fault, for God's sake! You think I enjoy this? You're all beautiful and intelligent if that's what you want to hear. Your wives are the prettiest. Your kids are the smartest. There will be no more sickness, no more war, no more unemployment. You'll all get raises! You'll all be richer! Have you gone mad? Couldn't you give them some good news for once? You shouldn't have joined our society. Tons of folks are just waiting for the chance to replace you. People more cultured than you, who have children. Who are unemployed. I'm done. Hello. Over. It's Chick's turn. Understand? Answer. Colin here. I copy, but I don't understand. Colin, listen to me. Your friend Chick is going to die. Colin? Do you copy? Follow instructions. Answer. -Yes. -Repeat. -How is he going to die? -He'll be killed. Who's going to kill him? Colin, don't ask me tough questions. You know I don't know anything. Over. I'm fed up. I quit. Your wife is sick. You have to work. You must go to Moscow. To the Flore. I'm in a hurry. I wanted to tell you… Drive. We'll deal with that later. Chick? This is serious. -Listen… -Right. Don't worry. Faster, please. Chick. -Have you seen Alise? -Alise… Alise is a nice name. Enough fooling around, Chick. It's spring already. Time flies these days. -Stop! -I don't have the right. You've got to take it. If you don't now, you never will. Chick! You're going to die! That's right. See you 'round! The usual, sir? Is that your next book? Yes. I wanted to ask you not to publish it. You know that's impossible. I mean, just wait five years, say. Wait? What for? Let me explain. Chick spends all his money buying your books. That's his right. His friend Colin gave him the money so we could get married. Because of you, we can't. Really? I'm sorry, but it's impossible. I'm sorry, too. -What's that? -A heart-remover. You're not going to kill yourself here, are you? -At my table? -No. I shall die committed. It's 150 without the tip. Colin, it's not a career. I'm fed up. I'm leaving. Don't go. Shall we have lunch together? You know I like you, Colin. Excuse me, but… We shouldn't have chosen this job. Really? You're silly. Ask for an hour off. I'll buy you an Eiffel Tower ticket. Come on. I'll meet you. Say. Promise you won't be upset? It's about Chloe. Colin. You understand? It's Chloe! You hear me? It's Chloe! Saint Colin. Colinette. Colinou. Colin? Colin! That water isn't clean, miss. If you want, I'll buy you a drink. What do you say? -What are you having? -Water. What about you, Abdou? The usual? -Your name is Abdou. -Yes. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Want another? -Yes. -What's your name, miss? -Chloe. Chloe? Chloe! Colin! Let's go home, Colin. Quick. Mr. Work? It's over, Mr. Work! Set your watch off mine. It's 7:29 a.m. Sixty, I love you. -Fifty-nine, I love you. -Fifty-eight… -I love you. -I love you. Forty-six, I love you. Forty-five, I love you. Forty-four, forty-three, forty-two, forty-one… forty, I love you. Chloe. Chloe! Colin. I don't understand. Me neither. How did it happen? I don't know. In my arms. I think we should go. Hello, sir. I'd like a room, miss. Have a look around, sir. Pick a room. They're all free. Really? But it's the tourist season. It was mostly foreigners. But with everything that's going on, fewer are coming. None at all, in fact. Will you be having dinner? Just soup, miss. Not even a little omelet, sir? Or a salad? No thanks, miss. If you don't mind, I'd like to go to my room. Shall I have your bags sent up? That's all right. Excuse me. Do you have an uncle? An uncle Nicolas? Yes, sir. Why? Do you know him? He's an old friend of mine. Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
