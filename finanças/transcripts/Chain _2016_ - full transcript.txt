What about men? Well it has no effect for men because, It's primary purpose is to flush the meter. But I would assume that it was tested, For vile function of error. And whoever has done it should take a lot of water immediately. Ok. I did, I did everything for you. I sacrificed, I sacrificed everything Everything for you. What didn't I do? To satisfy you. Is it a crime, To love you? What are you talking about? Don't you dare, Lie to me. Don't. Tamara it's just. Why? Why? Did you do it? I didn't do anything. Listen.

Do I need to answer that. Just answer the damn question. Do you know that this is my home? And my wife is back in the country permanently, do you know that?! Awwn awwn... That's so sweet. What does that have to do with me? I thought you have this figured out. Tamara Don't you dare touch me. You think you can just walk in here after a month without calling me. And expect things to be the same. What do you take me for? A dummy? Tamara do you realize that this is my matrimonial home. And my wife will be back any time. Cheers. How did you even get in here?

I love my wife. You know, I can clear up a lie scene. Cheating. But, I can't put off with the fact that you are denying me your affection. You said you love me. I do not love you. And technically speaking, am cheating with you. On my wife. This... Is our home, Our family home. You and your family, so just leave. Go. Now you choose. We both stay here, Or we leave together. Don't mess with me. I always win. If you try to prove smart, You know umm... Two, three. Ten steps ahead. Remember our sex thing, Pictures. Videos. I'm sure Andrea would recognise the "D" that you sent. Hmmm. Nice perfume Mr Castle. Uncle Tomide. Oh... That was great. It was awesome. I've always wanted this from the moment I saw you. Really? Then that makes it two of us. Come here. I've always want to visit you. Yeah. Where is Andrea? What? Andrea your wife. Right? How did you know about my wife? Heyy. I know everything about you. From the moment I saw your proposal for the bid. I have always kept tabs on you. But don't worry am with a baby. She won't bother us. Delm! Hayy... Mummy is back... Hii Booboo. Hey baby. Yeah come in. Hello Mr Castle. Hello. It's nice to finally meet you. The pleasure is all mine Thank you. Have a seat. Thank you. So umm.. What can I do for you Miss Ibru? Well umm... Like you read in our mail. Our firm will like to discuss your distribution rates. We seem to like your proposal but we have to reach a compromise. Your rates are way too high. Well, Miss Ibru. I don't think I can wave anything to sign the proposal you know. That's not how it works in my line of business. It's a bold decision. I mean being CEO puts me just above the staff. And not above the board so whatever that changes has to be made. Has to reach the cresent of the board. Mr Castle. The board is you, yourself and you. You don't have to fake it. But, There is a way I can award you the contract. If you get to win the contract. Your company will be signed to solid distributor products, To every part of the country for eight years. And the fun part you get access to an ascentives, Our promos, and you are free to invest. Hmm, So well, How much of a cut do you worth? Fourthy percent. Fourty what! That's insane you're not serious right. It is fair actually. If I were you, I would gladly accept the offer seems you are getting every piece of the action. There is that. Goodluck. Can I take you for lunch? I'll buy you dinner. Baby... Baby come here... I missed you. How was your trip? Well... For the most part mission accomplished. It's just that I have to keep checking up to make sure that everything is ok. I thought you were suppose to pick me up from the airport. I know right... But it got too hectic at work today we had this stubborn customer and then Forex trading issues, book-keeping and before you know it the day was gone. Babe that has always been your excuse every single time. Babe I haven't seen you in a month can we just not do this. Ok I missed you and I love you. Missed you too. In the main time am hungry. I can't thank God enough for Tamara she's amazing. Have you had something to eat I'm starving. Tumide I work. And it does get tough. How do you expect me to manage taking care of myself, Taking care of the baby, taking care of you and still work at the same time. Haba now... It's not fair, do you want to kill me? I'm not blaming you. Then what exactly are you driving at? What am trying to say is that you should have let me know before allowing her to to come and stay in the house. What if she were some imposter lying to you. She isn't. I mean you're the one who keeps on talking about this your cousin that you miss. The cousin that left when you guys were in school, And now you want me to drive her away. I didn't say so. Why did you keep it away from me? It was meant to be a surprise what is the point if I told you first. Besides ok, ok. Tomide. Didn't you and I agreed that we should get a baby sitter before you travelled. And then she shows up. Listen to me it's about safety this country thinks I've changed. You don't just allow somebody to come into your house, and staying there without vetting them for. Oh spare me the sermon Tomide she's your cousin or are you denying her. Just ahhh Abeg I'm tired. I'm tired abeg. Babe. Let's not argue ok. It's alright. I didn't mean to stress you out. Umm babe.

Is this a threat? Hmm you're such a big bold tiger. Why did you call me? My love I just called to check up on you. You know that's one of the qualities of a good wife. Fact of correction, You are not my wife and you will never ever be my wife. Hmm we shall see. Have a good day Mr Castle. Delm! What's funny what's your problem?

I fucking want to know the meaning of the text message you sent to me. Get your filthy hands off me. What do you want to say? What can you say? You want me to terminate this pregnancy. Your unborn child. I feel like I don't even know you anymore Tomide. Where are you? Can you just... Don't you dare tell me that. Ohh, you think you're not responsible. Come on, why are you even saying that, I didn't say that. Listen to me I just want you to give me a chance. I'm tired of your lies Tomide. I am tired of your lies. You told me you were working on your divorce papers with your lawyer. And then Andrea appears with your pregnancy. Tell me. Was it an artificial examination? Or she tripped and fell on your penis. Things have changed. Yes I was seeing a divorce lawyer. But then Andrea came back into the country permanently. She requested home transfer back to Nigeria because of me. What was I supposed to do? Welcome her home with our divorce papers. Just reason with me, understand me. And the pregnancy? So you kept shagging that bitch after all the promises you made to me. She is my wife. We've been married for six years now, six good years. What do you want me to do? Ignore her, stop talking to her. She is a woman like you she got needs. You know I still got you. You're sick. You really need help. Wow But Tomi, Why didn't you talk to me about this, why didn't you say something. You would've spoken to me. We would've sorted this out together. Bobby. What do I do? Do you have any plan? Anything? I'm not going to lie to you brother I am stocked this one is really complicated. The baby. Just terminate the baby. What? The pregnancy! That. She lost the baby. I mean she was involved in a accident and she... She lost the baby. That's why! That's why she is mad at you. You see because your wife had a safe delivery. And she lost a baby that's why she is mad at you. Here. Thanks dear. When was the last time you did something like this. Ahh me? It's been ages. I can't even remember the last time I was in the kitchen, on a saturday like this cooking like never happened. Hmm hmm. I couldn't get a diaper supply. What! Dham it. That means I will have to go to the grocery store later in the day. See this is why you end up having trust issues. I've paid this guy six month worth of diaper supply in advance. Why? Why would you do that? Me I like cash and carry oo. Is it not Tomide. It's the same thing for me but Tomide, Your uncle insist we pay in advance so we dion't run out of diapers. Come on, you know it's not his fault he just dosen't like you stressed. That man really loves you. Oh yes he does. Sorry what? I feel like I've been cheating him. You have been cheating on him. What?! No... No I would never do that no It's just... This is a clear case of obsession that girl is losing her mind and if you do not work with time she will kill you. Kill your wife, kill your child and turn around and kill herself. Bobby what do I do? You tell Andrea everything. Everything. Brother you are in deep soup right now and the next thing and the next thing you should do is to report her to the police. And if God still touch your mind you get that girl medical help. A phychiatric or a therapist or something because that's what she needs. Because everything can go worse in the twinkle of an eye brother. I feel, Like I've been a little. It's just, I feel like I've not been fair to him. I know he loves me but Ok. Tamara please tell me what to do. I love Tomide but I feel like I've been selfish in the marriage. But it's not my fault. What do you mean? Why is that? I mean I don't... I can't satisfy him. I mean in bed. Like seriously? Can I be honest? Yes please. I'm circumcised. So when we are doing it I feel nothing like absolutely nothing. I hear sex is supposed to be fun. But, My parents decided to cut my sex drive before I even had the chance to have one. We only have sex on saturday's. And even at that I will wind there and pray to God for it to end. You know just cum and let get it done with. I understand. Does he know about this? No. If I told him he would stop asking for it but am his wife. Isn't it my responsibility to please him. But I can't. I mean, God knows I really want to but I've tried. It's ok. I know it's not your fault. I think you should talk to him. He really loves you. Yeah. Tomide is a great guy. Even though I think he cheated on me recently. How? Well, I was still pregnant and you know me now, I never entered the kitchen. But on this particular day I came and, I found a drug in one of the cabinet guess what... It was abortion drug. When I asked Tomide about it do you know what he told me. He said it was for rat and cockroaches. Was it that good? Come. No baby. Here baby drink. It's late I have to go now. Babe come on I made you a drink. Ok one sip and that will be all. Not one sip it's just one shot so. You know am not sleeping here. Babe why? Come on. No more hide and seek. One sip. Just take the shot. Long, long sip just. Come on. Last one. No baby no. Ok come on just take a little bit of it just. Noo. Come on... Tamara. Tamara. Tamara. Tamara! Where did you go? I'm sorry I... I was lost in my thoughts. Is everything ok? Yeah. Please excuse me. Ok. Yeah Dr Shiza. Are you saying it is possible, To Terminate a pregnancy, without a possible release of blood. Yes it is but the reason we do not recommend it for patients anymore, Is because of it's high cost. And complications that might arrive from the procedure. An higher percentage ends up with complications which is from womb damage, miscarriage and possible cancer growth. What? That is why it was banned. The drug flushes the foetus and stores the blood till mensturation cycle comes around again before it eject it. But before that, it may tamper with other internal organs. What about men? Well it has no effect for men because, It's primary purpose is to flush the meter. But I would assume that it wasn't tested for vile function of error. And who ever has done it should take a lot of water immediately. Ok. Thank you. Babe sorry could you please help me keep this thing... Ok. Tamara I'll be right back ok. Yeah let me open. Thank you babe. Yeah. Alright dear see you later. Alright baby. Bye bye baby. Tamara. You ruined my life. You killed my baby. You damaged my womb. I did, I did everything for you. I sacrificed, I sacrificed everything, Everything for you. What didn't I do, To satisfy you. You and me. Is it a crime, To love you. What are you talking about? Don't! Don't you dare lie to me. Don't. Tamara it's just... Why? Why? Did you do it? I didn't do anything. Listen, Babe just calm down and listen to me I didn't do anything. Alright. We can get through this together ok just stay calm and listen to me. Ok Now this is your last warning. Ok. I want her dead. I don't care, I don't. I don't know how you are going to do it but I want her dead. Or else I will destroy you and everything that belongs to you. Hello. Oh babe. Tamara. Tamara please. Don't do this. Ok. We can talk about this. Please. Just put the gun down. Listen Tamara. On your kneels. Get down! Ok. Please don't do anything crazy please. Now, Tell her all you promised me. Tamara listen to me. We don't have to do this ok. Let's just talk it's two of us. Please. Tell her... Tamara listen to me you want money? Is it about money? Just what do you want. Just name it. The company? ok I will give you 40% in the company. Ok 50%, 60% I'll sign off right now. I will give it to you right now. What do you take me for? You think I want your money. I made you I fucking made you. Tell her. Just listen to me ok. It's two of us let's talk about this my family has nothing to do with this just. You killed my baby. Tamara please. Just leave my family out of this. Just leave my family out of this please. I told you. I told you I will kill her. I will kill her where we watch. Tamara just leave my family out of this I have four bullets. One for her. One for the baby. Tamara please no. Please no. One for you. Don't don't. Tamara please don't. Now make your pick. Who goes first? Tamara please just stop this. Stop this. I've made my choice. Tamara!!! Tamara Tamara!!! There is only one happiness in this life. To love and be loved. Love is a fire. The way it's going to warm your heart and burn down your house you can never tell. Does love truly fail. Is love really blind. It's true that being deeply loved with someone gives you strength. While loving someone deeply gives you courage. But what does love truly mean. Where does it live. To love at all is to be vulnerable. We accept the love we think we deserve. And we waste time looking for the perfect lover. Instead of creating the perfect love. I love you without knowing how or when, or from where. I love you simply without problems or pride. I love you in this way because we do not know any other way of loving. But this in which there is no eye or you. So intimate that your hand upon my chest is my end. So intimate that when you sleep my eyes closed. Love cannot save you from your own fate. Women are meant to be loved not to be understood. Love is the madness sent from heaven to worry the hell out of us.
