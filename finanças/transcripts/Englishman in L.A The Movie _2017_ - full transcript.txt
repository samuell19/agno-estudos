My name is Tom Dingle. I'm from Oxford, England. Uh, I'm an author, and I'm currently in LA. Oh, and um, my bestselling British novel may be getting turned into a movie. (PHONE RINGING) Hi, I'm here to see Cassidy Clark. Oh, hi Tom. Uh, sorry, have we met? Oh, sorry, no. I'm Penny, I'm one of the writer's assistants. Nice to meet you. I just got done reading the script. Uh, what script? Dove at War script. Dove at what? Don't worry, it's just a draft. But they, they didn't even ask me. You know, I loved The Lonesome Dove. I thought that the dove dying was a metaphor for the sacrifice and the rebirth of the love between Molly and Demetrius post war. That's exactly it. Really? No one's ever got that before. This way Tom. I'm so sorry, I have to run, but... Oh, don't worry, you'll see me around. (PHONE RINGING) Sorry. Sammy, hi. Yes. Yes, we are on for tonight, but I have to run. Okay. Done? They love you, Tom. They love the book, it's gonna be a huge hit. Yes, but I've heard that they've written a script, I didn't agree to that. This is Tom. This is W. Leibowitz from the head of Cinema Studios. And you remember my assistant Brad. They love Dove at War. (HAND CLAPPING) Love Dove at War, Tom. Great work. Tally-ho. Picture this, Tom. Dove at War is set in the future, mm hm. Our two protagonists, Molly and Demetrius, are separated by a war between man and alien. And they communicate by dove. It's a completely different story. But that dove is actually an alien. (SNAP) It's genius. (LAUGHS) (HAND CLAPPING) It's a, It's a completely different story. Uh huh, but they still communicate by dove. But, but it's absurd. CASSIDY: It's still a war. But it's, it's not World War II. Excuse us. Look on me, these guys at Cinema Studios, they know what works, okay? We're willing to bring you on other rewrites, give you a producer credit. You don't get deals like that handed to you on a silver platter in this town. Well I, I think I need to think about this. Do you know how, how hard, how hard I had to work to make this deal with the studio? I'm sure you worked very hard, but but I really should... Excuse us. Do you know how fucking hard I worked to get this deal? You know how hard? You're an incredible talent, but you have got to trust me. And you gotta be open to change. Uh, yes but do we have to change the whole story? Of course not. You can do your rewrites and put your foot down on certain changes, how's that sound? I think it would be okay. Sign here, Tom. Here. Um, I think I need to read this. Trust me, Tom. Let's just say he's not the only one with a particular set of skills. Tommy, Tommy Dingle Dangle, ah. Mm, sign it. Ah! Yeah, thank you. He's in. This way, Tom. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Doll, your assistant. Oh, I'm sorry, I, I don't need an assistant. You have a busy day ahead, Tom. We have publicist in one minute, stylist at 12:00, haircut at 3:00, trainer at 4:00, and red carpet for Herpes Foundation at 4:30. Can I get you anything, cocaine, coffee, tea? What? Okay, groovy, let's get going. This way. They always say no at first, but you'll see. (LIGHT MARIMBA MUSIC) So yeah, she's a hot one. Yeah, I can arrange something. All right, sounds good. We'll talk. Tom, how you doing? I'm very good, thanks. So, Cassidy spoke highly of you, but I don't kiss ass, okay? Now, I looked at your online presence which was definitely interesting. I mean it isn't fucking awful. But, seriously, what's with the bird thing? Oh, well uh, I'm an avid birdwatcher. I recently went to Tanzania with my father and we watched the night owls and the button quails. Okay, we're gonna have to lose it. Uh, what do you mean? It just does not fit into your new image. My new image? Young Hollywood, Tom. Sharp, mysterious, no more birds. Something more like this. Oh, wow, uh, who's that girl? Oh, she's your new girlfriend. Katya Aura, you like? I don't have a girlfriend. Uh, so sorry, what do you mean? Ah, she's great, Tom, and you'll just be going to all the events with her, she'll be on your arm. Uh, what events are these? Magazine parties, art openings, charity events, you do like charity, right Tom? Oh, uh yes, I'm actually on the board for the International Bird... Okay, enough with the birds. I hate birds. You like art, right? Yes, I'm quite versed in Anglo-Saxon tapestry. What? Anyway, you're just gonna go to more charity events and art openings. Actually, tonight you're gonna go the Herpes Foundation. And you're gonna go with Katya, she's gonna walk the carpet with you. The Herpes Foundation? The Herpes Foundation fundraiser is one of Hollywood's biggest nights. I've heard of celebrities who purposely contract herpes just so they can walk on the red carpet. Um, but I have a date. Tom, I worked really fucking hard to get you into this event. What time is this date? 5:30. Well, the event starts at 4:00. You can make both, great. Go meet your stylist, she's gonna suit you up. But, do you think I actually - have time... - Tom, one more thing. Can you do that whole Hugh Grant bit? I, uh, no... (LAUGHS) I love it. I wasn't actually doing Hugh Grant. Just go, Tom. Thank you. (PHONE RINGING) No, we want the cover. In return, I'll give you some more dirt on Bieber. Yeah, he went to Thailand last month. He loved long time. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Tommy, baby, Tommy, ding dong! Look at you, no, no, no, no, and no. Ooh, what are we gonna do with you? 'Cause that don't twerk, baby, ha! I am Shana Vogue, and I am Tom's stylist. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your little feelings. You's as cute as a button, but we gotta get you red carpet ready, baby girl. Right. Yes, uh, okay. This is a hot new designer. He's designed for Miley, Gaga, RiRi. Bitch is cray. I can't wear that. Okay, well, then, mm. Why don't you try this on? Come on, Tom. I don't have all day. Mm. When Tom walked in, oh Lordy, I thought it was my tax guy. Brooks Brothers on a 20-year-old, God forbid. You know, I do girls too. I'm all right, thanks. Think about it. Come on. Eh. Okay, stop. We've been going about this all sorts of wrong. You're British, and British means royal, traditional, bad teeth, but still sexy. (GASP) I know what you need. Try this and, um, (GASP) this. (LAUGHS) Come on. (GASP) C-U-T-E twerk it! Um, is that a good thing? Ooh, you're makin' me sweat, Tom. H-O-T! Okay. I quite like the Ben Sherman. Ooh! Work it and twerk it! I said, work it and twerk it! I said, work it and twerk it! - Work it an tw... - Twerk it! Sit down! Okay, try on the next. And oh, try these. Oliver Peoples, darling. Simply divine. Hm. You should let those breathe, here. What? Okay. TOMMY: Ready. (SHANA GASPS) Ah! Shana! Are you okay? Tom. Ya look good enough to eat! Well, thank you. I do feel pretty good. You look great. Pretty good? You should feel great in that suit! Well, do you? Shana, I'm not sure I can do all this, this young Hollywood thing, I don't think I have the... Confidence? Zing, je ne sais quoi? Yes, how do you do it? Tom, you just have to feel comfortable in your own skin. Look, it took me 25 seasons of Oprah and three seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race to think like a queen. See, a queen isn't afraid to fail. Failure is but a stepping stone to greatness. Now, you just have to find your inner queen. Or king. Or whatever works. My inner queen. Or king. I think I can do that. There you go. And, as they say, fake it until you make it. You can fake it, right? God knows I have. Yeah, I can fake it. Praise Gaga! That is what you're wearing tonight. Thank you, Shana. You've been a savior in this whirlwind of a day. I'm really starting to look forward to this herpes party. Uh, Shana. Um, do you want to come to the Herpes Foundation fundraiser tonight? Shit! Shit? Shit yes, I'll come! What am I gonna wear? Hm. I love the, the blue jacket that you got. Oh, thank you, Cassidy's calling. Oh, okay. Hi Cassidy. Uh, I'm, you didn't hear my answer. I said I'm great, we just got some new clothes actually. BOTH: Ah! (MANIACAL LAUGHING) Hey Tom. Molly! Oh, oh wait, oh, so now you know my name? Raw meat, really? Has she not heard of Salmonella? This is all a big misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? I understand perfectly well. The last time I saw you you called me a cow and you had me escorted out of your book signing by security guards! No I didn't! Ah, oh, so now you're calling me a liar? Molly is what you can call a fan girl or ex-fan girl now that she hates me. You better keep those cameras real close, Tom, because the second you turn your back, it's gonna be misery for you. Ah, ah! SHANA: Tom, Tom! (LAUGHS) The Gaga meat dress is so tired. Just wear the Ben Sherman. He's London cute, not Los Angeles cute. I mean, he's not my type, but I wouldn't say no. I'm so sorry, um, let's get you a new shirt. Work! We're here at the Herpes Foundation fundraiser, one of the biggest nights in Hollywood. Welcome back, I'm Ryan Seaview with A-list Hollywood News. (DRAMATIC DRUMS AND STRINGS) And it looks like the guests are already arriving on the red carpet. Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor! Looking fantastic, what are you wearing? Um... And as I understand, you actually have a friend out here, a newcomer to Hollywood, Tom Dingle, is that correct? Yes, that's right. I met Tom in England, he's so sweet. Now, repeat after me. BOTH: I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen. CREW MEMBER: Shana Vogue. Bye bitch. TAYLOR: So just show up and look good 'cause the most important thing is that you feel good, right? Oh, and look who it is, Carly. Hi. How you doin' t... Muah, you're so cute, Ryan! Absolutely, thank you, I appreciate it, and... Oh my god, Taylor! There she is. Go get her. She is such a skank. (LAUGHS) That she is, thank you. Okay, well thank you, Carly. Think of the red carpet as a jungle. With Tom's new look and Katya on his arm, he's graduated from being a mouse to an eagle. Tom, Katya. Katya, Tom. Hi Tom, pleasure to meet you. Pleasure to meet you, Katya. Put your arm around Katya's waist. Is that okay? Sure. GIOVANNI: Smile for the cameras. (CAMERAS CLICKING) Katya looks... Wow. You are the one who founded the Herpes Foundation, is that correct? Yes, indeed, that is, yes. Oh, oh. When people think of me, they think herpes. I wanted to, to really shine a light on herpes. Yeah, well there's a big light tonight. It's a proud night for herpes, Ryan. It's one proud night, that's very accurate. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Katya really knew what she was doing on the red carpet. I was lucky to be with her. Looking beautiful as always, thank you so much. Have a good time inside. Thank you so much. It's right over here. Now Tom, why do you support the Herpes Foundation? I uh. We support it because there's no cure yet. Anyone can get herpes, not just hookers, and until we find a cure, people will still look gross. Katya, and Tom, do you have genital herpes? Excuse me? Have you ever had genital herpes? No, Tom doesn't have them but feels deeply for those who have. Do you have them, Ryan? You would know, Katya. Shut up, Ryan. Okay, you can go now, here, you can. Over this way. Okay, thank you, thank you. Hey Tom! (GASPS) (SCREAMS) PAPARRAZO: Oh my God! I am Molly Summers! Molly out! PAPARRAZO: Molly, Molly, Molly! Anthrax! (HYSTERICAL SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It was so great meeting you. You too, I'm sorry about the white powder thing. What a bitch. It's fine. So, you really have to leave? Uh, I'm sorry, I really do. Well, we have to do this again some time. I loved hearing about the bored owl. It's the barred owl. Right the bod owl, it sounds so cute. It is. Goodnight, Katya. Goodnight, Tom. Sammy. Tom. Are you okay? Oh yeah, I was just sleeping. Oh, um, okay. You're late. I'm so sorry, I was at this red carpet event with this model. It was all set up by my agent and my publicist. How was it? Oh uh, it was, it was crap. Have you been doing coke? What? You got like... No, oh. No, this Molly girl, she threw powder on me and it, it's a long story. What's happening with the movie? Oh uh, it's going ahead. That's great, oh my God. Did I tell you I was an actress also? No, no you didn't, that's fantastic. Maybe you could be in the movie. (GASP) I would love that. You know, when I was reading the book I really connected with the Molly Summers character, it's just so serendipitous. I didn't know Sammy was an actress, but maybe she's pretty good. Do you have a lot of acting experience? (CLEARING THROAT) If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, (GIGGLES) do we not laugh? If you wrong us, shall we not revenge? Sammy, you know Shakespeare, brava! ♪ If you like penis coladas I thought it was pina coladas. ♪ And getting caught in the rain That's incredible. Molly Summers sings in The Lonesome Dove. I know that, silly, I read the book. Mm, Tom. What's wrong? You just look so hot right now. No I don't. Yeah, it's the new suit. You look like a rock star. Uh hah, no. Thank you. Excuse. I have to tinkle. Didn't need to know that, but if you have to go, you have to go. Don't go anywhere, you big Hollywood stud. I won't. Yeah, we're at the Farmer's Daughter. Tom Dingle is cheating on Katya Aura with this actress Sammy Monroe. Sammy Monroe. Whatever, he's just cheating on Katya with this really hot girl. TOM: That was such a lovely evening, we have to do this again... Tom, Tom! Right here, right here Tom! Are you dating Katya Aura? No, no I'm not. Miss, what's your name? Who is this? Sammy Monroe, singer, actress, songwriter. (CAR HORN) Tom, Sammy, hop in! PHOTOGRAPHER: One more, Tom! That's right. That's right, baby. Work it. You're safe with me, boy. Thank you. Oh my God, that little tart, what is she wearing? Ah, somebody must have called TMZ. What's TMZ? They're the Hollywood vampires, Tom. TMZ, sucking on anything for a story. (CAMERAS CLICKING) You said you weren't with her. I'm not. I saw you two together, you were on the red carpet. I saw you on TV. Yes, but it was all set up. Oh my God, what a mess. My father is going to be furious. Tom, I will speak to your father, but I think you should stay at my place tonight. Come on, gang. TOM: What a day. Yes, well I've got some nice kibbles and a bottle of gin at home. (LIGHT MARIMBA MUSIC) Tom, tom. Wake up. Doll, how did you get in here? I have my ways. Cassidy is calling. Tom, were you asleep? Uh, no, no, no, I I mean, yes, I was, I'm sorry. Tommy, what did you do yesterday? Uh, I don't know. You're in every paper. I have the Hello reporter asking me, me, Cassidy Clark, for an interview. I'm so sorry, this is all a big misunderstanding. CASSIDY: Tom, it's incredible. The red carpet anthrax incident has put you on the map. You can't buy this kinda publicity. So, it's a good thing? Uh, the rule of thumb in this town is being relevant, and boy are you relevant. But, we have damage control, you know? I need you in the writer's room today at noon, so pick up your British butt, your little naked butt over there, yeah, I see you and uh, get over there pronto, okay, ciao. Uh. You'll be needing these. And this. And these. Ooh. Morning, Tom! Hi, Will. Who is this young filly? Oh uh, this is my assistant Doll. Good morning, Doll. Howdy. Wow, uh. Ha ha. So sorry, Will, we're in a such a rush. I've gotta deal with, um, press stuff and the writer's room. Ah, the writer's room, I remember the writer's room so fondly. The writer's room, such fun. Did you know that I was one of the original writers on, let's see what was the show, um... So sorry Will, gotta go, but um, I'll call you. Please. Use your telephone, your, your mobile. Cocky little bastard. Where did Tom go? He trusts us, that's all that matters. I need to play Molly Summers in that movie, and we need the money. You will, don't worry, Squirrel. I'll get that cocky little shit. He'll be sorry. (WRITERS CHATTERING) So sorry I'm late, guys. Um, so uh, what are we talking about? I'm sorry, who is this guy? He's the author of the book, remember? Cute. I love a stiff Brit. I know how to make a blockbuster. It involves the three As, action, aliens, and ass. Course, if you're making a porno it's the three Bs, butts, bosoms, and balls. But I don't make those anymore. I'm just not convinced we need the dove. Yeah, I agree, it's cheesy. Cut it, Penny. Excuse me, I say cut it, Dick. Cut it, Penny. The name Demetrius is not very relatable. How about Stan? It's very manly. Yeah. Stan. Where are my Skittles, where? Here they are. Uh, I told you to remove the green ones. God Grace Jones, honey, can you not do anything right? I'm sorry, must have... Just leave them. Okay. Does he have to be British? Uh, excuse me, but Demetrius has to be British. Eh, his name is a direct reference to Shakespeare and has connotations of unrequited love. The last thing we need around here is another British writer. I'm enough. Penny, can you have a word with Mr. Dangle? Dingle, my name is Tom Dingle. - Whatever. - Oh my! (HISSES) Could someone get him some catnip? He can dingle my dangle any day. Uh, Tom, come with me. He's been here five minutes. Okay, Tom, this is gonna be hard for you to hear, but those guys in there, they have no idea who you are. Unless you're in Oprah's Book Club, you're kind of C-list. They're gonna make some changes and they don't really care what you have to say. Uh, why am I even here if they're gonna change the whole story? They won't change the whole story. I will make sure of that. Look, I've been doing this for a while. If you wanna be heard, just take my advice, just shut up. I, I mean, you have to show that you can be quiet, and I mean, just don't say anything. Unless asked, but if you are asked, do not give an opinion, just say something like oh, we should look in to that, or maybe. Okay. Okay? Now, I'm thinking we need a big bang right in the beginning, you know, something heart-wrenching but on steroids. What if? Stan's parents are killed by German fighter pilots? Maybe. Maybe what? Maybe we should look into that. You're right, Tom. Oh okay, that's enough for today. See you all bright and early. Nice work today, Tom. Thanks, Massimo. See, you did it. Wasn't that bad, was it? It was okay. See you tomorrow. Thanks, Penny. Oh. - Hello, Tom! - Oh, oh my God! Molly, Molly, wait, wait, wait, don't, don't throw anything! Wait, this is all a big misunderstanding. Why don't we just get to know each other a little? You wanna get to know me? Yes. Get a coffee or something? Yes. Now? Molly is crazy! Wait, if you are messing with me, I swear. I'm not, um, how about dinner tonight, uh, at the Daily Dose, seven o'clock, with my friends. Dinner? The Daily Dose, wow you, you really know how to treat a lady. Okay, all right! Yeah no, I'm excited, that sounds good. Um, I had you all wrong. If he is messing with me, I will fucking castrate him! So, how's your week going? Uh, it's been quite eventful. Oh yeah, what happened? Well, as you know the movie's going ahead, but they keep changing the story. Mm, how so? Well, first of all, they're setting it in the future. Oh, that's interesting, did you tell them about me? Um, no, not yet, but we're not even casting yet. Tom, they start casting the moment they start writing. You have to tell them about me, you're the one with the power. Well, that's the thing, I'm not sure if I am. They laughed at me in the writer's room and and I was told I need to play by the new guy rules. Okay, Tom, this is a cut-throat town. You have to exercise your power, okay? Don't be afraid of those guys. You wrote a beautiful book, don't let them take that away from you. Right. So then, you'll tell them, right? That I'm playing Molly Summers. Uh, yes, yes. Yay, (CLAPS) fantabulous! I just realized, I have to meet William. I'm so sorry. Oh, I know, silly, William invited me. Oh I, I didn't realize. I talked to him, it's fine. Just take a deep breath. Everything is going great, you should be proud. Hello! William. SAMMY: Hey. Oh sorry, are we late? No no, Tom, relax, relax. Tom, Tom, is that you? - Oh, Molly! - Hi! Hi. Hi! - Hi. - Uh, should we, okay. What is she doing here? I invited Molly just to, to square things over. I'm not having dinner with her after what she did to you. I'm sorry, - what was that? - No, no, no, no! Calm down everyone, please! You wanna go? - Okay, she's fucking... - Calm down, calm down. Please, look, obviously there's been a spot of trouble. But we Brits, we pride ourselves on being well-mannered. Isn't that right, Tom? Yes, that, that is right. So, please, sit down, everyone. Be nice, sit down, let's be adults. Let's have a pleasant dinner! That sounds fine by me. Fine, whatever. Darling! She's with the dogs. Hi, I'm Candy, I'll be your server. Hi, Candy, um, we will have three waters, please. I'm sorry? Uh, three waters, please. Is that it? (LAUGHS) Um, can we please have, uh, three waters for the table? Oh, you're ready to order? I haven't even given you your menus. No no, no, three waters. And uh, a round of these lovely Queen's Pink Bottoms. Ah, thank you for clarifying that, William. Yes. I mean, wouldn't be my first pink bottom. (LAUGHS) know what I mean? Pink bottom? Okay, I'm uncomfortable. And that is how I got into helping disabled children. Incredible. Tom, I, I do charity as well. No you don't. I do, I help the homeless. I help feed them every week. You should, you should come by some time. Candy! Another round of Pink Bottoms. William, a little drunk from the first round. - Oh, man up Tom! - Oh stop, come on. Go on, tell me. What have they changed thus far? Um, well, they're changing Demetrius into a guy, American guy named Stan. And who are the head writers? Um, Massimo Maximiliano and this little twerp called Dick. (GASP) (LAUGHS) He doesn't like you. I'm probably being silly. Yes, you absolutely are being silly then. Drink up, drink up. I'm very drunk, Will... Keep getting drunker, Tom, for Britain! For Queen and country! Yeah! What was that joke you were telling? It wouldn't be my first pink bottom. (LAUGHS) I don't get it. Tom, what if Sammy and I just pop by the writer's room tomorrow just to say hello? Well, I'm, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Come on man, we won't be a minute. We'll be in, we'll be out, we'll say hello, and you know. I don't know if I'm allowed. Oh, you're allowed. You're definitely allowed. Totally. Totally. Um, okay, why not? Okay, so I'm bored now. (LAUGHS) I'm gonna go, but this was really lovely. You are very, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. There it is, okay, all right, okay I think my Uber's here. Wait, no, that's my Uber! That's my Uber! Molly. That's my Uber. May I attend to you? Oh absolutely, okay, hi, you're tiny. WILLIAM: That's her fucking Uber! Tommy, let me get for you, that's okay. It was divine, but she's crazy so you need to, you need to watch out for that one. Mm, she's lovely. She just threw shit on you, okay, so she's not lovely. Dinner tonight with Tom was literally the greatest night of my entire life. I mean, other than that skank interrupting us every two seconds, it's like, I always knew that Tom and I had this amazing connection but oh my God, it's like, it's like we're all a lonesome dove searching for our other lonesome dove. DICK: William, I'm so glad you came by, and then... Tom, why didn't you introduce us to this fantastic actress? Oh my goodness, she's just delightful! So, William is going to be joining us from now on, Tom. You should have brought him before. PENNY: Okay guys, can we get to work? Very well, where are my Skittles? Yeah, on it. (MASSIMO HISSES) Ingrate. MASSIMO: Dickypoo, what do you got? William has some great ideas. William? Shut up, Tom, and let the man speak. Thanks, Dick. Well, I think the story being set in the future is great. Stan should fall in love with Molly, but Molly, wait for it, is a spy! DICK: That's a twist. Molly can't carry on being a spy because she loves Stan too much. And so, she sends the alien dove, and Molly must adventure to alien planet. William, why are even here? Well, you invited us last night. Didn't he? - Yes, he did. - You invited us. Can we get this down on paper by tomorrow? I need to see it on the page, Penny can you get on it? Sure, I got it. Now, wait one minute. I may be new here, but this doesn't make any sense. Stan has to be British, and Molly can't be a spy. We have to focus on what's important here, we have to focus on the story. The lovers are separated by a war. Chill, Tom, calm your ass down. Oh my God. Now look, Molly has got to be American, I don't want this to be a Brit fest, okay? American actors need to work too, ya know? Fine. Molly can be American. Someone get him some catnip, please. God, all right, kittens. Let's call it. I need a martini and a back rub, God. DICK: She'll do it. MASSIMO: Come on, Dick, and don't forget my Skittles. Tom, let me explain. Just leave me alone. Tom, wait! Tom just come on. I can't believe they would do this to me. My dad was right, I am stupid for coming to LA. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Molly? Absolutely, just text me the address. Tom, wait! (FEET DRAGGING AWAY) Um, what is this place? Does it matter, it's a bar? Good point. Um, two, uh, Jager shots, please. Yeah, now we're talkin', shots. Uh, bottoms up. Okay, wait no no, here. Ah. All right, two more. Uh. No no, yeah, it's happening. Ah. - Uh. - Ha ha. All right, let's get real for a second, okay? When I called you earlier, it seemed like you were in like a panic. Yeah, I walked into the writer's room and there's William and Sammy just sitting there. Sitting there, that's cra... Who, who are William and Sammy? William and Sammy. From dinner the other night. Oh, right, right. Okay, all right, why were they in the writer's room? Sammy is now playing Molly Summers in the film. Wait, what? That doesn't make any sense. Molly's so innocent and that Sammy girl was kinda trampy. I know. I just, I just thought they were my friends. I mean, how can people be so cruel? I know, sugar tits. Ah, it's this place! LA makes people crazy. Mm hm. You know, I'll be your friend. You will? Yeah. And I would never do any of those things to you. I'd do other things to you, but. Thank you, Molly. Molly. Such a pretty name. Thanks, Tom. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Uh. (KNOCKING) LADY: Room service. I, I didn't order any room service. LADY: (knocking) Room service for Mr. Dingle. Doll? Late night? What are you doing here? It's my job. Yes, but you followed me? - No. - Oh. No, of course I don't follow you. You wanker! I can't believe you slept with her. I mean, at least Sammy's hot in like a slutty way, but you'll just get with any old bicycle. Oh, shut up! My head is literally killing me. Wait, wait a minute, who the hell are you? I'm his future wife. Huh, yeah, okay. Honestly, how could you do this to us? Us, what, what are you talking about? I mean, we were meant to be together, Tom, but you just ruined everything. Doll, have you lost your mind? You're my assistant. I know I'm your fucking assistant, Tom. Okay, get the camera outta my face! Why do you think I became your assistant? I'm your biggest fan, Tom. Oh, wait, no, hell no bitch, I'm his biggest fan! Shut up! But honestly, you just ruined everything. I can't deal with this right now. Uh, Molly, I will call you later. Do not walk away from me when I'm talking to you, Tom! (WEEPING) Tom, no, I want my English muffin! I want my English muffin! Finally, Molly has calmed down. Now I have Doll going crazy. Will you be my friend? Tom? Katya? Late night? Yes, I mean, at least I think so. Are you okay? You look a little upset. Yeah, I've just been having a really tough time with everything, my friends, I thought I could trust them and doesn't matter. No, it does, I understand. People in this town are all out for themselves. You just gotta find the people you can trust, ya know? It's like Marilyn Monroe said, "Hollywood's a place where they'll pay you $1000 for a kiss "and 50 cents for you soul." Yeah, you're right. Thank you, Katya. You're one of the few people who've been genuinely nice to me, not trying to get anything out of me. I just treat people the way I like to be treated. I'm no Mother Teresa. But look, if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Katya, do you wanna be in my film? Dove at War? Sure, but I'd have to read the script, and I don't do nudity despite what people say. There is no nudity. Do you mind coming with me somewhere? Now? It would be a big help. Hm. WILLIAM: Did you become, uh, activist... Tom, you're late. And it's not fashionable. Who does he think he is, Elton John? Oh, it's so nice of you to decide to show up, Mr. Dangle. Oh my God. Ah, ah, ah! Katya, hi. Hi, Mr. Maximiliano. We go way back, this one. What is she doing here? Katya is gonna be playing Molly Summers in Dove at War. No, I'm playing Molly Summers. Oh, calm down Sammy, we'll find another part for you. - Katya, is this true? - So unfair. I'd love to if you'll have me. Of course we'll have you. Oh, look at you ya bombshell. Oh, sit down, come, sit. Ah! (WHISTLING) I shouldn't tell because I was throwing a goog... William, come here. One, one second, Tom. Now! Yeah, all right. Don't get your knickers in a twist. Look, I know it must seem strange yesterday, but it just happened, right, just, you know? I know your secret, William. What do you mean? You're not British. (LAUGHING) What a, what a bunch of Dumbledore, I'm British through and through. You see, it first occurred to me at the restaurant when you said water. We don't say water William, we say water. What, yeah, uh, Tom, I don't know what you mean, water, I mean eh, I went to Cambridge with your father. Yes, and came back a Brit. You haven't spoken to my father in years. And I realized, us Brits have manners. You just forced your way into the writer's room. You're not from England, William, you're from Bakersfield. California. And unless you want me to out you to everyone in Hollywood, you better get the hell off my movie. Oh come on, Tom, of course I'm British. How else would I know a Lannister always pays his debts? William, that's from Game of Thrones. Do you watch it? All right, look. Can we talk, Tom, I mean look, we can work something out. They love the accent, I'd be nothin' without it, and, so... Everyone, I have an announcement. William is... Leaving. Yes, William is leaving, everybody. I'm sorry I can't work the film. My, my, chinchilla just gave birth. - Yes, ha! - Aw. I'll be, um, needing to take care of the litter. Yes, so, uh, we have to go, Sammy. I'm not leaving. You're leaving, now! Uhh! DICK: Awkward. Fine, whatever. You guys can have your ridiculous whatever movie. But just remember this face 'cause I'm gonna be a star. I'm gonna be a star! Yeah. Oh, get your hands off me. She really is a great singer. We'll send rewrites in the mail. Remember my face. Okay, um, why don't we all take our seats and, uh... DICK: Okay, children, let's go from page 42... Actually, Dick, we'll start it from the beginning. The hell we're not. Well, I guess I could ask me and Katya to leave, right Katya? Exactly. We, we could start... Shut up, Dick! Tom, please carry on. Thank you. We have a lot of work to do. All right, kitty cats, everyone back to the beginning. Penny, do you wanna go on a date tonight? Yeah, sure. What time? 7:00? Sounds good. (JAZZY MARIMBA AND STRING BASS MUSIC) (DRUM ROLL) (ORCHESTRAL FANFARE) (CAR ALARMS AND THUNDEROUS RUMBLING) (JOYFUL CHOIR)
