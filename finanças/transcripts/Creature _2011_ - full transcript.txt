You know I love this kind of shit... whats that? see the house that grimley built..who's grimley? It's a local legend told around these parts. Its strictly louisiana tale... What? like bigfoot? Yeah, kind of like bigfoot... but who's grimley? You guys really wanna hear it? no okay, story goes... There was this family called the Beaudines... The Beaudines lived out here in the swamps... They lived deep, deep in these swamps... Living off the land... Isolated, they kept to themselves...they've been here for generations... the family had chosen the simple life, for simple folk... Like most families, they had their own ways... Theirs...was the old way... Around the eighteen hundreds it seems that Beaudine family was dying out... Sterility... So, after a while that Beaudine family tree... Only had a couple branches left... Caroline and her brother Grimley were their last hope .. what? you mean? you mean? oh man, you know that is just wrong... dont be so quick to condemn them.... It was the Beaudine way. The Beaudine way is not new... European royalty, Pharaohs, the myans... Alright, alright, get on with it. Anyway, life looked pretty good for old Grimley... With a child on the way, Grimley intended to take the young girl as his bride... But...on the eve of their wedding... Anon, the legendary white gator rose from the murky depths... In a flash of blood and teeth, he stole her from beneath Grimley's very eyes... His world was shattered...destroyed... In Despiration, he scoured the swamps, his heart breaking with each step... Looking for any sign of his true love... but Caroline was gone... Now, Grimley knew he still had a chance to find her.. Gators don't eat their food right away...store it for later...whatever, right? Softens the meat... Okay, Karen, I think we've all seen animal planet...now let me finish the story. How does that sound? Grimley , he tracked the ancient white lizard... Through a series of caves that ran underneath the swamp Thats where the monster's larder was... The last of Grimley's humanity...evaporated...in that blood soaked cave In the darkness, his sorrow was so great...it turned to rage...rage became insanity He began to change... And in his madness... He turned his sorrow...onto the monster that created it... He began...to eat....He sat there all night...eating... He ate every piece of flesh in that cave... Including his sister... oh my gosh, uh...I think im gonna be sick... Just a story, sugar... Anyway... So the legend goes that Grimley changed, mutated, became one with the gator... They say he's still out there, in these swamps... Looking for fresh meat for his larder....and a new bride to thaw his heart... That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard... Well shit people, are we going to check out this guy's place or what? Come on, man it'll be fun! Oh, whatever... Settle down you old fool...
