Germany April 1945 Two weeks before the end of war Come on! Where's that little piggy? Come on now. Where is he? Where's the little piggy? Come. That only means, that there's something left here. Come on! Thieves! Thieves! He's getting away! He's getting away! I'm gonna ... Ah! Ah! ♪ That's too good to be true. ♪ Like a miracle falls upon us. ♪ A golden glow from paradise. Thanks. Thank you so much. Yes, tell me something, what do you think you're doing? How dare you! Am I seeing right? The pants are too long? Excuse me. Excuse me, Captain. What did you say? What did I hear? Huh? Run, you shall. Run! Come on, you'll get your chance. Run, I want you to run! Go on, run! Run for your life, you little piggy. Go on, run. Private Walter Freytag reporting for duty, Captain. I lost my unit. I obediently ask for permission to join you, Captain. Got stuck? Then I'll get the Captain out of the dirt. What do you think you're doing? Let me see your pay book. - I lost my unit. - Be quiet. You're deserted. No, Captain. Scattered. We were involved in heavy fighting. Half of the battery... You look hungry. Nothing to eat for three days, Captain. Very hungry. All right, let's try it together. - Then you'll find us accomodation.. - Yes, Captain. Dark as in my ass here, Captain. Let's do it. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler. Don't take it personally, Captain. Uniforms are no longer a pretty sight. Especially not German ones. Scrounger. There's a lot of talk about the conditions behind the front. But things seem to me even worse than I feared. Name? Schnabel, Gerd, Captain. Party member since '32. Look, I know things don't go according to plan around here. - The roast was an emergency slaughter. - The poor animal... Relax, relax. I don't want to get anything into anyone. Just tell me what the damage is. By looting by deserters. What did those crooks get, what was it worth? Please. For the refund. I'm here to make sure everyone gets their money. Money? After all, the Party still ensures law and order! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! - I had two carriage horses... - You don't have any horses. Is there any food left? Breakfast was a long time ago. Yes... Even roast there. Freytag, roast! Freytag? There is roast. Give the host a hand. Go ahead. - They smashed my dishes. - A cupboard... For you, Captain. Enjoy your meal. Splendid. Looks splendid. Yeah, well, let's take a little break. Don't worry. Everybody gets what they deserve. Greetings. Indeed. Greetings. Captain! Captain, we got one! He stole. - Order has to be restored. - Yes, sir. Time to earn the roast. Everyone what they deserve. Just in case, I'll put a candle on your nightstand. That was hard. - Wake up call on time tomorrow at 5:30. - Yes, sir. And... - What about breakfast? - There's some bean coffee in the car. That's good. It isn't nice to leave with an empty stomach. Yes. Thanks. The Captain Where to now, Captain? - The barnyard is on the right. - Yes, Captain. Now first of all attention! And better fast! Come on! Let's have a look then. Pay books and marching orders. This is Greater German Broadcasting with the "Wish Concert for the Wehrmacht". - Field of action is the other direction. - Deserters. I said that right away. Answers! Come on! Captain, I report obediently... We were scattered from our troops. - And that's where you settled here? - At my expense. Drunken pack! Field policemen are in the next town. But he smashed our phone! Come here. After all, you can't put up with everything. - A schnapps! - Yes, Captain. Schnapps. - Captain... - Did I ask you anything? So? Captain, I report obediently. Request permission to join. All right, sit down. I've got a job to do behind the line. And I need help with that. COMMANDO "H" You will help me. To the Bodyguard Herold! Together we are strong. Captain. What's the job, anyway? I want to get a clear picture of the situation behind the front. I can help you figure that out. The situation is what you make of it. Isn't that right, Captain? Stop! Aircraft! Again! Continue. Captain! Where are we going, anyway? Area of operation is straight ahead. Military police! Everybody, line up! Soldbooks out! I won't say it again! Out! What do you think you're doing? As captain of the Luftwaffe, I resent this disrespectful treatment. - I want to speak to your superior! - Yes, already there. - You don't want to show off your pay book? - To a Corporal with that behavior? Why is your troop without a marching orders? - A special operation. - Special operation? - Report of the situation behind the front. - Aha. - With what warrant? - With what warrant? Warrant from the top. The top. Warrant from the Führer himself. He's heard a lot of things. There are concerning rumors about the situation here. But first, tell me who you are. Sichner, Josef. If you show me your pay book now, we won't talk about it anymore. At least in yours there has be something written. All right, then. Then if I may ask for your papers, too? As an officer of equal rank, I may also examine your documents. I shall also have to note that in my report, Captain Sichner. Weapons down. Yes, you know... With all those deserters, you don't know who's in the uniform anymore. Monstrous. - Freytag, return the pay books. - The rag pack roams around looting. - That's why the controls are so tight. - Very good. The Führer likes to hear that. You will have to show the pay book more often. You're right. These looters must be taught how to behave. Captain, I will accompany you on your inspection, get a picture of the situation for my report and, where necessary, I'd be happy to assist you. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! We'll take the men with us and tow the cart! Pay books! - Heil Hitler! - Captain Sichner. We bring deserters to camp II. Open up! Yes, sir. Open up! Stop! Not so fast. Captain Junker. Heil Hitler! Captain Herold is to report on the situation behind the front. - To the Führer himself. - The Führer? Tell him the situation sucks. - Camp II? - Jump in. Well? I got some friends with me. We know each other. - Crete? - Eh... - Narvik! - 1940. Hairy situation. Part of Wehrmacht? - Paratroops. - Hm... - And you? - 1940? Poland. My god, Poland 1940... I loved it. I never forget a face. Well, I'm sure we'll remember. Up, up, up, up, up! We still have a little time. I'll buy you a drink. Well, come on as long as we're waiting for gas. That's an outrageous luxury. To keep workhouses and work camps in operation during this time. Nine out of ten inmates are morally unstable and of no human value. - Right? - Outrageous luxury. You say it. All the prisoners were brought here from the camps we evacuated before the enemy arrived. And now we must feed them until the judiciary... Uh, this way. Gets its way, to finally judge them. And what do the posters say? Ey! What's the Party preaching? "Restore order if you see looters." Captain, eh... - What was the name? - Herold. Captain Willi Herold. Right. Captain Herold. I have to take care of my men. A pleasure. We take care of your men. Ah! SA leader Schütte. He is in charge of the guard unit. This is Captain Herold. Heil Hitler! I am glad to see you. Finally something happens. We're forever waiting for the Stand Court. He's not from the Stand Court. What? No? So... All I heard was Special Ops, and I thought it was time to get serious. He's supposed to report what it looks like behind the front lines. To the Führer. Himself. The Führer? Yes. That's why I told Captain Herold about our storage problem. Oh, I see. Yes, you know... with all the escaped prisoners we have here on the home front something like our own war. Even if it's not as fine there as it is with you officers. We're struggling with the same problems. Just the other day, I found another looter. - And? - Restored order. Yeah, like I always say. The population has asked us for help because the prisoners go into the houses and steal. The highly pregnant wife of a SA man has been attacked and robbed. Those who desert, loot and rape must be tried. Escaped prisoners are out of the question for a pardon. And we need to make sure they don't fall into the hands of the enemy. But the Stand Court doesn't convene. Here the Wehrmacht should rule, not the judiciary. They are only talking and they're assuming things are staying local. But where brave front fighters die every day, it's not acceptable that proven, convicted criminals live like bees in clover, because nobody has the guts to take action. The vermin is safer than any front-line soldier. And that would be easy to solve if you just wanted to. Yes, yes, the Captain understands our dilemma. Right? Of course. You can't ignore a state of emergency like this. - You will talk to the Führer? - Put in a good word for us? It would take a load off our minds. Maybe even more is possible. Yes? What... What do you have in mind? I don't want to promise anything. First I need a picture of the situation. And my troop needs board and lodging. You settle this with the prisoners, and we'll take care of your troop. Well, let's get to it. Take him right to the detention hut. I have to clarify that with Hansen. With the camp leader. The internal area with the security detainees is under the jurisdiction of the judicial authority, I have no authority there. Yes. Then I guess I'll have to grant you the necessary authority. We can't have justice dancing on the Wehrmacht's nose. Great! Well, I have to go. Schütte, you take over. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Great. Captain Junker! - But now I want to know. - What? - Well, how do we know each other? - Oh so. Hm... No. I just can't remember. Well, that happens, doesn't it? Mhm, yes. If I could show the captain the way? To the detention hut. Prisoners who have become refugees shall be kept separate after their seizure. Attention! Hurry up! Fall in! Get a move on! The vermin must be taught discipline and order. I'll let all of you pigs die! I'll get the camp leader. ' can interrogate the prisoners already. Did you steal? Looted? Raped? Ah! Didn't you hear what the Captain asked you? Misdemeanour? Desertion. Multiple desertion. Ah! Line them up outside. Now everyone's emptying their pockets. If you don't have anything, you're next. You got anything? You got anything? Put in in there. That's okay. That as well. Who's got something? You got something. Give it to me! Take it out! Give me that. You? Heh? You? You? Give me that! Give it to me now! Captain... - Pardon me ... - They are already dead. One way or another. Yes! What is it now? A captain from the Luftwaffe wants to see the prisoners in the detention hut. Does he have a sufficient warrant? Yes, most sufficient warrant, directly from the Führer. Directly from the Führer? Hm... But in the internal camp area, one of my law officers must accompany him. In the internal camp area you, your SA guard units or the Wehrmacht have no authority whatsoever. With your permission, I'll take it from here. Well, it doesn't comply with the rules. - I hope we're aware of that, don't we? - Of course. But now that I'm already, officially, the liaison person for the captain... Fine. I'll be right there. - Eh, Schütte? - Yes? The daughter of Winkler from barrack four asked that to be handed over to her father personally. - Can you do that for me? - Gladly, it's on my way. Asswipe. Get out! Come on, get out of there! What did I tell you? Get out! What are you looking at? What's the matter with you? Huh? So you're going to hold the Stand Court yourself? My father always said, "What you start, you finish." Finally something happens. Brockhoff! All prisoners are to be brought in immediately. Don't let them get to the windows. Shoot immediately if contravened. Position men at the barbed wire every 15 m. And dig a pit. These criminals don't need coffins. All right. Come in. Heil Hitler! Take a look at this. Come on, hurry up. What the hell's going on here? Mr. Hansen, may I introduce you: Captain Herold. Ah, the captain. Do you have papers for that? The Führer personally instructed me to take all necessary measures whenever German combat strength is endangered. "The soldier can die, the deserter must die." Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Nevertheless, I ask you not to do anything else for the time being. Because I have to contact my supervisor first. After all, I have no instructions from the Justice Department. That should be understandable to you as an officer. I'm at your disposal. Dr. Thiel, Hansen here from camp II. Yes. I have Captain Herold here. He says he has a warrant from the Führer and has already executed five prisoners. Yes, in the inner camp area. Ah, one moment. The Deputy Special Representative of the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Thiel. Captain Herold. Five prisoners, yes. I know they are subject to justice. They attacked me during an pre-interrogation. Yes, all five of them. Mr Schütte can confirm that. Yes, I can indeed. Of course, their guilt is proven. Otherwise they wouldn't be in the detention hut. Yes. Yes? Understood. Dr. Thiel would like you to wait until tomorrow before taking any further steps. He thinks the law is very clear. A Stand Court must be properly organized. Dr. Thiel will get in touch with the senior public prosecutor in Oldenburg and will then check your warrant here in the camp. - He is welcome to do that. - He will definitely do that. You have not yet understood the seriousness of the situation, Mr Hansen. - I guess you could say that! - Come on. Everything must be right. Nobody wants to take that on their own. Captain Herold! Captain Herold, that can easily be solved to everyone's satisfaction. If the Gauleiter is on our side, I know him, then there is no longer a problem with the Ministry of Justice. We can easily keep Dr. Thiel away from us. Captain Herold, yes. With full authority from the Führer. Yeah, that's right, he's supposed to be here at the camp tidying up. Yes, the Captain has already disposed of a few prisoners. He says, "You have to start somewhere." I see it the same way. The Ministry of Justice is only stonewalling. But we should definitely coordinate this with the Gestapo in Emden. Oh, you'll take over? Great! He says, "When Captain Herold wants to take over, we all save time." He'll call you back. Schütte. The Gauleiter. Yes. Is anybody from the agency coming? Nonsense, we can do this on our own. Heil Hitler! He says, "Break a leg, that this is will work out." Dr. Thiel? Yes, this is Schütte from camp II. Captain Herold wants to speak with you. Dr. Thiel? And put me in charge. The camp matter was handed over to the Gestapo in Emden. He checks with the Gestapo, talks to the Attorney General and then informs Hansen. ♪ Sleep, kid, sleep. ♪ Hansen's a sheep. Aha... Hansen here. Lovely. Uh... So the Gestapo has transferred the matter to Captain Herold as a simplified Stand Court and assumes all responsibility? Yes. I see. Uh, Captain Herold has sufficient authority. Yeah. There's nothing we can do about it. Yes, I understand. No doubt about his authority. Mm, yeah. Yes, I see. Heil Hitler. Line them up! Come on! Get a move on! I thought three groups of 30?

Reload! Ah! Jammed. We're out of here. The flak is done. chebinhdan.com Everybody shoot! Come on! Captain, what is going on here does not comply with the regulations in any way. What you're doing here is a downright scandal. This is inhumane. I will report that. Ah! Continue. It's going great, huh? Somebody's gotta get in there. You there! Freytag! You're going in! Come on! Come on! Come on, goddamn it! Let's go! Save the seriously injured from unnecessary suffering. Report obedient, order executed... Captain. A complaint about the improper disposal of 90 prisoners. 90, Dr. Thiel. Uh, what? Uh, oh, that. Captain Herold has organised a variety show to celebrate the day. Among the prisoners are some artists. You should shovel! Yes. Uh, and because of the complaint... I'll fuck you up! I'll send you to the pit! - Yes. Yes, I see. - You should shovel! - I'm sick of this! - Uh, yes. Yes, I agree. Insubordination! It's punishable by death! - I'll beat you with this shovel... - What's going on? - This is a huge scandal! - Shut the fuck up! He can face the music himself. They refuse to close the pit! Then do it yourself! And make sure there is peace and order! You have to give me everything in writing. I'll pass that on then. I must insist on an official report. I'm powerless here as well. Come on, I'll take you to the village. We don't need Herold's variety show. With your permission, I will stay away from camp until Herold's departure. Yes, for all I care. It'll be over soon anyway. Oh, kiss my ass. You will regret that, you sows. Come on, let's get to work. - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! To celebrate the day, there's plenty of booze to drown in. - For everyone! - Yes! Anyone who shows that much effort, he should have it good. Cheers for now! In two weeks, on 20 April '45, the Führer's birthday, the victorious German offensive will come. The Führer said it, and the Führer doesn't lie. With me since she was 15. Do you believe that, Captain? A heart and a soul for 20 years. Like all big cats, I only search for a partner once, but then for life. No, a banana! Ah! - Ah... - How you doing? Like the Jewish lawyer. Why? I can't complain. - You, Rabbi? - Yes? I would like to know: What does "relative" mean? - You don't know what is relative? - No, I don't know what it means. - Want me to explain? - Yes, I do. - Good, Moshe. I'm pulling down my pants. - Oh. - And the underpants. - And now? - I bend over. - And me? - You stick your nose up my ass. - Uh, is that necessary, Rabbi? Yes, Moshe, otherwise I can't explain to you what's relative. - Is your nose deep in my ass? - Yes, it's deep in your ass! So now we both have a nose up our asses. - Yes. - But I'm relatively better off. Bravo! - So. Oh... - I'm so hungry. - Really? - Yeah. Do you have anything to eat? I haven't had anything for so long... No! - A giant killer sausage. - Oh! I haven't seen anything like this in ages. I'm hungry! I'm hungry. Oh, no! No! Oh, no! Oh, God. Oh, God. He is hungry. I am hungry too. Hunger, hunger. I'm hungry too. Oh! Ah! Now I can eat too. Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai... Hahaha. Hihihi. Haha. - Hey! - Yes! Bravo. They're really good. Bravo! ♪ Comrades-in-arms!

Now I want to say something about our great Captain Herold, who has decided the whole thing here so quickly and... and took it into his hands splendidly: It went smoothly! Smooth! Smooth! Smooth! First of all, thank you for all the nice words. But I have to say something about it right away: Our work here has not yet been done. None of the prisoners, the parasites in the camp, may fall alive into the hands of the English and make common cause with them. To holy duty and obedience! - To the Battle Group Herold! - To the Battle Group Herold! Ey! What's going on? Why don't you sit down? Come on, we won't bite. Come on, sit down. Come. Come on. Come here. Here. - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! - What is your name? - Roger, Captain. - Misdemeanor? - Nothing, really. Nothing really? Then you're not a criminal. Nonsense, I'm an actor. Ah... - A completely hard-boiled one in addition. - You could say that. - I'll get your file right away, you little pig. - Not necessary. Let me ask you something. Purely hypothetically. Well, let's pretend. As if you had done something. - But I haven't. - I know, but you are an actor. - Yes, but... - Then pretend like you did something. - Yes. - That's what "hypothekic" means". Hypo-what? Hypothetically, you mean. So, what would a guy like you do if he did something wrong? I've got a pretty good instinct for that. What does he look like? He's a thief. What do you think, Gerda, huh? I don't know. Hm... maybe a murderer? Murderer, me? I didn't kill anybody. - I am not a murderer at all. - What are you then? Come on, come up with something. It's only... Hypothetically. You're just acting the criminal, so to speak. So... So, I'm not a murderer. And if I were, then... Yes, then more likely such a... - Such a thief. - What did I say? What did you steal? - I haven't thought about that yet. - But that's no fun. - Maybe you have stolen food. - If someone is hungry... When it comes to survival. Some eggs here, some bread there. Couple of lies. Little. Big ones. Whatever gets you through tough times. If you don't turn death, it turns you. For example, I stole this uniform. No! - I stole the wine. Haha. - Yes, and I stole the potatoes. - Purely hypothetically. - I can steal this sausage. Captain, you're quite an actor. Seriously, what did you do? I stole from a dead comrade? - Oh, you're a corpse robber. - That's a nice confession. - I mean, hypothetically. - Do you know the penalty for that? Shall I tell you? What? Shall I tell you, you? Do you want me to tell you exactly? Huh? Should I? Come on! Come on! Hey, what... what's going on here? Come on! Come on! - Come on, you pig! - Hey, what the fuck? Not wanting to dig! Come on, get out, you sows! That's enough! Off to the canteen! What kind of mess is this? You dirty pigs! To the canteen, now! But not like animals! Brockhoff! Captain, you can't do that. That is not a decent way. That's no way to act. That's not German! That's enough! Listen up, everyone, when Captain... commands! Listen, everyone, when the Captain commands! - Enough now, I say! - Listen up, everybody... when the Captain commands! - Listen, everyone ... - Who does he think he is? Captain, will you please get this place in order right now? Listen, everybody! Listen, when the Captain commands! This place must be in order! Run. No! Don't be a coward. Ah! Ah! Next round's on me! Welcome to the Herold Battlegroup. Captain! Captain! - I need to speak to the captain. - He is indisposed. - It is urgent. - I'm telling you, he's indisposed! Then... then tell him the Volkssturm is here to comb the area as ordered. - Report obedient... - I heard it. Go to the canteen. Deserters loot and rape, terrorize the civilian population, endanger our fighting comrades. This must be put to an end! It is not enough to wait for this scum to act. We have to stop the rabble from doing it. These are asocial, worthless elements that are not acceptable for Germany. I expect a quick, efficient cleanup. Don't be a pussy. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! About the pants... They were too long. But now they fit again, Captain. Yes, that's me. The captain. Captain! The Volkssturm is back. British artillery! Ah, no! Let's do this. Fall in. Bodyguard Herold, fall in! This time our lives have become cheap. Isn't that right, my dear? Great party, boss. But the place is closed. Both of you, I promote to the rank of Chief Military Police. You're sergeants now. And you'll get uniforms. We'ven been through here. Of camp II only a post of the former turnpike remains. The rest are fields. Quick Court Herald Stop! Traitors to your fatherland! Shit. Aquire provisions. I am Captain Herold. Leader of the Task Force and Quick Court Herald. I am the Avenger of German Honor. And I will give every traitor to his fatherland what he deserves. This judgment will be applauded by all honourable Germans and will be a warning to all cowards who betray the fatherland in these serious times. I will restore law and order to this place. Freytag. Ask for the best house in town. Have pass-through fees ready. Wait, wait, wait. Hold it right there. Your handbag! - Hey, on the floor with you. - Get down! Hey, pretty lady, freeze. Hold it right there. This way in. Erika! - My friend Irmgard. - Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. This is our Captain Herold. Personally honored for his bravery by the Führer himself. Thank you. He! He! He! - Get out, come on! - Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! You dog! Get off me! Let go of me! Let go of me! You are accused of looting, theft and... of high treason. Private Kipinski is a disgrace to our troops. The Quick Court Herold has ruled him guilty and hereby sentences him to death by... Shooting. I entered you like the devil enters a virgin.

Field police! Get up! - Get out! Come with me! - Hands up! - Get up! - Field police! Field police! Open the door! You're a private! So you confess to having committed the following offences: The unauthorized wearing of an officer's uniform, the committing of a massacre in camp II and the killing of a mayor who has hung out a white flag. Shooting. Shooting of a mayor who has hung out a white flag. My father used to say: "He that hath done wrong shall at least admit it." Legally, the case is perfectly clear. The man is to be sentenced to death by hanging. I don't know. That seems exaggerated to me. Under the given turmoil of the time Herold did not behave at all so absurdly. He showed a brash military appearance, but did not inflict any significant damage to the Wehrmacht. Herold always behaved like an officer. He's been standing at attention throughout the trial for more than four hours. Without a twist. That's a jagged fellow. He has demonstrated tremendous fighting leadership qualities. - Such men impress me. - I would like to add: What led to all these things was only my determination to contain the increasing defeatism in these last days of war and to urge Germany to continue fighting. I see so much evil committed out of necessity, but this man is impossible with healthy wits. Oh, you know, when I think like that... we as young Free Corps fighters... Ha! We used to shoot frantically sometimes. - Hahaha! - Are you really going to acquit him? Limited release! I recommend suspending the trial and putting Herold on probation at the front. Herold is a dashing guy. Such a man is worth his weight in gold. In these times. Let's not kid ourselves, gentlemen: The war is in its final stages. The Reich has lost the war. But that does not mean that we will give up. We will build an elite organization that will continue the armed underground battle after the enemy occupation. Heil Hitler! We march to Berlin by foot to free the fallen Reich capital again! Yes! On the 23rd of May 1945, former Private Willi Herold is arrested in Wilhelmshaven by the Royal Navy. During the following interrogation he entangles himself in lies. When it became clear which war crimes he commited, he was tried. On the 14th of November 1946 he was sentenced to death, together with six accomplices. He was 21 years old.
