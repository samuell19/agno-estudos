The Phantom of Morrisville It was a misty, dark night. In the light drizzle, the guard of Middlesouthborouch Stone prison... cracked open a window and bid his sight in vain to penetrate the impenetrable fog. -You wouldn't let a dog out in this weather. -He mumbled and closed the window again. Out of the shadow of the prison wall, two figures appeared. The bigger of the two, Dixi, called Stick, pulled a short pistol out of his pocket. -What is it? -Asked the smaller one, called Rosie. If it's anybody but Micky, I'll bring him down without hesitation. One could hear light footsteps. The third gang member, Micky, alias Chicken, was coming. -All right? -The weather will pass. If something unexpected doesn't come up, Manuel Diaz will be freed tonight. -Let's go. -You talk too much. Before the boss is free, I'm in charge. Let's get to work! Thread. String. Rope. Few men succumb to sleep, when their life is at stake. Only one could fall asleep on Death Row. Your last wish, prisoner. -I wanted a banjo and a manicure set. -The prison head forbid it. It contained a file. Pliers, saw. O.K. Coil it up. Second, wait, although you aren't exactly beautiful -Unharness time and wait a moment -Third window on the left, not the fourth. And let it come back Let her be happy with me My darling, who I like Let my flag be in rags Let tomorrow be lost in darkness Let the Devil himself hold me in his clutches I don't know, the work fear When it has to be Let the punishment come I'll bear it as a man Let the executioner come Let the black wall come I'll be laughing Please now, Second, wait my star, my glow Just no hurry Just wait a moment I'm missing that light You know, the one I like The one I like -The one I like One day when it suits And I'll be a big lord I want to leave on a big ship Across the blue ocean No one there will know That I escaped from prison I could hang out at the bar like the Perian sheikh Ho, ho, ho Ho and ho and ho While I can sing yipee yey I can live anywhere fine Ho, ho, ho Ho and ho and ho When I lose everying yipee yo Let the devils take me away I understand why they call him ''singing Manuel''. He won't be quiet until the morning. -You don't love singing, jail keeper? -On the contrary, I like listening to it. And I'll be having fun I want whisky in a barrel And a leather jacket And I'll go, yoho Sleeping with the Sheriff's wife Ho, ho, ho Ho and hou and hou While I can sing yipee yey I can live well anywhere -He's a great singer. -Yes, Father. And an even greater crook. From the luxurious study of M.C. Pellham, the press magnate Ladies and Gentlemen, came this announcement: Allan Pinkerton calls M.C. M.C. calls Allan Pinkerton. Allan Pinkerton calls M.C. M.C. calls Allan Pinkerton. One moment, madam. Tea? Whisky? My dear Pinkertone, tonight at midnight there will be a wedding at Morrisville between Sir Hanibal Morris, and Clarence Hamilton. You'll attend as a representative of our newspaper. It'll be a pleasure. Thank you, sir. Do you know Alan? Who is the lady? My mysterious benefactor. During my studies at Oxford, she always appeared at Christmas. She had me called to the dean's office, and there she kissed me on the forehead. Then she disappeared again. -How did you come to her? -She came to me, with an unreasonable request. I told her that I won't send my best criminal reported to the wedding. But she came up with 51% of the shares of our newspaper, so I couldn't say no. -I wouldn't want to refuse a lady something. -I understand. Sir Morris is entitled do such an honor. We studied together, served in India at one regiment. I was there when he proposed to his first love. -I didn't know he had been married. -Engaged, dear boy. I was called off, when he introduced his fiancee to his family. -Financial reasons? -Oh no. Social ones. Poor Hanibal fell in love with Miss Arabella. -Pardon me. -What Sarah Bernhard was on stage, was Miss Arabella in the circus. She enjoyed great successes in both hemispheres. -The whole world knew her. -Tamer? -Show rider. -I understand. That wasn't the worst of it. Old lady Morris liked horses too. Tea please. When she found out that Arabella's mother is a hairy lady and father is a clown she refused to accept a daughter of such socially unacceptable people. There is something in that story that somehow excites me. -What happened next, did they break up? -Actually yes. She disappeared without a good-bye. -And Sir Hanibal? -He was angry. After some time he got a letter. Not a love letter, but entirely impersonal. It said that Arabella would like to use the first opportunity to tell him that he is the father of a child that he will never see. Signature, dot, and that's it. Poor Sir Hanibal. Go there and make at least a column out of Hanibal's naivety for our Sunday paper. Yes, sir. A propos, Allan, can you fly a plane? -A little bit. -Then that means something. You'll take my personal biplane. Good luck. Hello? Allan's manly, chisel-sculpted face, is a sportsman's face, which has only one belief. Belief in himself. There's something of a falcon in his eyes, but on the bottom of those two steel grey wells await the waggery warm sparks for the one, who Allan Pinkerton hasn't met yet. The glorious notes of the organ in the Morrisville chapel rang solemnly into the velvet night. Sir Hanibal Morris, do you take Clarence Hamilton as your lawful wedded wife? Yes. And you Clerence Hamilton, do you take Sir Hannibal Morris as you lawful wedded husband? Yes. From this moment you'll go a together to eternity. Heartiest congratulations. Rose. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Second, stop, although you are not exactly beautiful unharness time and stay a while And let her return Let her be happy with me My dear, who I love Hello, Brumpby. Old, brisk Scotland Yard slave. How is it that you are always there, when something happens? How is it that you look like a policeman, even at a wedding? So far, it resembles a funeral. Advise me Brumpby where can I get myself a bit civilized? Miss Mabel, this is my personal enemy, Allan Pinkerton. Journalists say that he should be a detective. He could be a good journalist, if he didn't worry about Scotland Yard matters. Look after him and disregard his appearance. In reality he looks worse. Sir Hannibal's secretary. Excuse me, please. Thank you, Brumpby. -Where am I? -In your bedroom, my dear, by your husband. Forgive me, Hannibal, that I fainted. -I was upset. -Don't worry, darling. -Do you feel better? -I'm fine now. -something serious, Doctor? -Normal wedding fainting. Could my wife attend the ancient ceremony then? In exactly 8 minutes she will be fine. Otherwise however, she'll be sick for 2 to 3 weeks. -Why are you giving me this? -I'm not giving, I'm returning. -Oh I see. -But then I could think that you sent me this. If you value your life, leave! -Which one is yours? -Choose. What will you do, Brumpby? Look, I'm already old, and for a few years I will not spoil my character. How about you? I'll stay, too. -My god, Manuel, you're alive? -I'm alive. And how. -Don't forget that I am the wife of another. -I do not forget. But you have a short memory. When night falls and smells of violets The moon unfolds nets in the pool Nothing in the world burns more acutely Than loneliness When my dust taints the stars of heavens A nightingale knocks in quiet bushes All I think about is you, my dearest It saddens me to have empty arms I have empty arms Like a poor man's palm So bleak as an empty house So I roam the world And I pay tax to Love For which I'll once lose my mind I have empty arms like a deaf flower and bleak as a dry savanna I sing softly And I can only envy Covers, which count your heartbeat I would like to take you to who knows where To a dew-strewn meadow in the spring I hope I'll succeed one day But now I have empty arms My arms are desolate Like a sea plain As empty as blind eyes I sing softly And I pay taxes to Love And the whole world is shipwreck shipwreck, stranded wreck Here, give it to me! You came too late. Given where I'm coming from and how they treated me there I'm coming just in time. -You escaped from prison. -From Death Row even, darling. -What If I call the police? -You do not need a phone for that. That old dick Brumpby, is sitting downstairs. Call him. And we'll see what the law and Sir Morris say, when I show them this. Mercy. Don't ruin me. Leave. Leave from my life. -My wedding gift will be your compensation. -Don't tug it. Or you'll damage the clip of Morrisville emeralds. So what next? -I could send you money. -How much? So you can live a carefree life. -You couldn't get that much. -I'm not saying now. But in time. Hanibal made me the universal heir of his vast fortune. Now we're talking, girlie. I would be foolish fool, if I I was content with a bit, when I can have everything. How so? If you belong to me, then so does everything that's yours. But it will be mine only after Hanibal's death. -I do not want to think about that. -You don't have to. -I'll take care of it. Excuse me? I'd like to introduce you to an old Morrisvillian ceremony. Take this cup, which you'll hand to Sir Hannibal. This man, Sir Elvud Georg Morris, got married at the beginning of the 17th century. His rival in love, Commodore Campbell Patney, decided that with the help of bribed servants he would poison Sir Elvuda. Fortunately Sir Elvud's favorite hunting dog jumped into his master's lap and overturned the poisoned cup. His master ordered him to lick up the spilled wine. He licked once, twice, and after the third lick dropped dead. -What was the name of the dog? -Bahadur. He was posthumously promoted to the peerage. To avoid a similar case repeating, we have a habit in our family since 1608 that the wedding cup, which the bride hands her husband is first tasted by the dog, Bahad's descendant, and then his master drinks. Followed by a normal wedding festivities. -To your health. -To yours. Barely did Clarence appear ... Barely did Clarence appear ... Barely did Clarence appear, there was whispering in the choir, how beautiful she was. How beautiful. How beautiful. How beautiful. Seven. Seven. Indeed lucky number. Do you know who was born on 7 July? -La Fontaine. -Also. And who else? Wait. R. B. Sherriden. And then? Well, me. Call Berry. fifty-seventh Earl Berry of Bahadur. The dog instinctively sensed that the wine was poisoned. Do not touch, hands off! It's a police matter. Get a box; we must send it off for analysis. Analysis can be done on site. Is the laboratory open? We would need to bring one more witness. -There's one. -Please. -I am innocent. -No one suspects you, dear. Still, I'd like to talk with you alone. Come with me, please, to the terrace. -The devil! That's a bit much! Caliber 45 mm pistols of Belgian production with a long barrel. Do you think that bullet was meant for me? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but... -someone here is striving for your life. -But who? -You always write things down? -Recently yes. There are moments when I forget the whole world. Now we'll see, if your hypothesis is correct. This, please, mix it with the wine. Here. Not yet, please. I'll tell you. -Now! Congratulations, Inspector there was strong poison in that wine. Very strong. Reputation, Pinkerton, wrongs the tigers. They are not nearly as bloodthirsty as human beasts. -What about that up there? -Beasts are also among the animals. -The one inside it was a friend of yours? -No, a cook. -That touches a man. -Of course. You can not imagine, what woodcock on wine he used to cook. -Where was I? -At human beasts. As if by magic a gun appeared in Allan's hand. The bullet jammed in the barrel. What's going on? Did somebody shoot? Sir... I wanted to, but I didn't shoot. What if it was a lady? We can consider it certain, that the offender... We can not exclude, that the crime was committed by a woman. That the perpetrator took a spear from the other room and tried to kill your Lordship with it. After an unsuccessful attempt he fled the scene, or escaped through the window. Thus, the perpetrators must be sought in the garden, and due to the speed at which he moved, also outside the garden. -Well, and if we exclude the other ... -Your procedure, Inspector although strictly logical, it won't get you very far. If you exclude all thos who could not have committed the crime, you'll conclude that it could have been commited by anyone else. -Do you know a better method? -Certainly. I know that the crime could not have been committed by a woman. May I ask, why not? Try to pull the spear out of the oak panel and you'll find out. Inspektor, the tip is poisoned. I think Pinkerton, that you're right. A woman couldn't have done it. -I'm rarely wrong, sir. -What do you think you, Mabel? I am convinced, that Mr. Pinkerton isn't wrong. Sir Morris sought happiness, and almost found death. Allan Mabel and seek nothing. But it seems that they found each other. There are, however, at the beginning of the road, and clues lead who knows where. There are, however, at the beginning of the road, and clues lead who knows where. [End of demo subtitles]
