Look, you start out in this line of work-- you better, if you're gonna do it right-- eager to help people. When people tell you about something wrong, that's a-- you get a good feeling 'cause, "Now, maybe I can fix something. "Maybe I can get rid of some unfairness. Maybe I can improve people's lives." And then you go along and, uh... you get a little, well, you know, sometimes people have bad complaints, but you're still eager to help. And at some point I reached the, uh, the transition, so that when people called me, it was no longer, "How can I help you?" But in my mind, "Why are you bothering me?" At that point, I realized, "Yeah, you probably should get out." Shocking political news yesterday. One of the best-known names in the House of Representatives is leaving-- Barney Frank of Massachusetts. Over the years, he's become a big target for Republicans. Say good-bye to Barney Frank. He is corrupt. Barney Frank is an idiot! What a lying sack of you-know-what. He's the worst of the worst! Responsible for the housing bust! Slob. Barney, you're gonna burn in hell. Then I won't have to listen to you. You're a homosexual. Then I won't have to listen to you. If you want to go to hell, Barney... ♪ Was ist los mit dir mein Schatz? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Geht es immer nur bergab? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Geht nur das was du verstehst? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ This is what you got to know ♪ ♪ Loved you though it didn't show ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ The words "end of an era" get thrown around a lot, but this is one of them. The news organizations trumped out analysts to speculate the reason for his retirement. To be the minority in the House of Representatives is not that much fun. The difficulty of getting acquainted with his newly-redrawn district... No indications that there are any health concerns. Are you leaving your fellow Democrats in the lurch? Hello there. How are you? Good. What's your name? Dylan. Dylan? Nice to meet you. ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪♪ I thought you'd be here forever! Barney Frank! I was trying to give you a break here. Mr. Frank! How ya been? How are ya? How you enjoying your retirement? Not yet. Six months. That's right, I'm looking forward. Ahh... See ya. Have a good time. I-- I will miss this job, but I will tell you this and, you know, maybe you're gonna laugh, but one of the advantages, to me, of not running for office is I don't even have to pretend to try to be nice to people I don't like. Now... Some of you may not think I've been good at it, but I've been trying! No, I'm sorry, you're not gonna do this to me! You're not gonna misstate what I said and then shut me off from responding. Well, congratulations, you're four for four in managing to find the negative approach. A rite of passage here in Washington to have Barney Frank make you feel about this big. Always a pleasure to have you on this program. Sometimes more than others. Barney, how ya doin', pal? Barney Frank has spent 45 years in public life. He spent 30 years in Congress, and as he retires now he will be remembered as the Frank in Dodd-Frank in Wall Street reform. He will be remembered as the finance committee chairman when Wall Street blew up. He will be remembered as the member of Congress you would most like to see argue with whoever it is you most dislike in the world, because he has a sense of humor that he wields like a wrecking ball. Well, first, to be... accused by Bill, speaking on behalf of the Republicans, of insufficient commitment to rational immigration policy is like being called silly by The Three Stooges. I mean that... with no disrespect because... No, to The Three Stooges. Shemp... Shemp Howard-- Shemp Howard, born Horowitz, was married to my father's cousin, Babe Frank. So that's my, uh... but-- Now, that's impressive, you know. Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy, as Obama has? When you ask me that question, I am gonna revert to my ethnic heritage and answer your question with a question. She didn't start with you. On what planet do you spend most of your time? All right, Barney! Finish her! Ma'am, trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table. I have no interest in doing it. Oh, damn! Ohh, damn... I'm Barney Frank, and I authorized this message. I can't imagine who else would. How are ya? Hello. Hello, Barney. Hello. Hi, how are you? Hey. Hello, Barney. Good to see you. Hello! Hello. Nice to see you guys. Just sitting down for some lunch. Well, I'm a congressman. For another two months, then I won't be anymore. Right front and center. How are you? 274 Grove. I'm fine. Yeah, okay, I got you, Barney. There you go, turn out for the camera, come on. Oh, he's doing a documentary. We-- all right, smile for us, darlin'. Okay. It fell down. There we are. I was always interested in politics in-- in high school. Sorry, Toots! I thought I saw one, but it's handicapped. Okay. I never ran for anything there, but I followed politics a lot. When I got to college, I was engaged in Young Democrat activities. I never expected to be a candidate myself, though. First, because I was Jewish, which in the '50s and on to the '60s was still a constraint in America. But secondly because I-- I realized when I was 13 that I'm gay, and, uh... at that point, certainly, and for many years after, the notion of a gay elected official didn't seem very-- very plausible. What's the backdrop? Uh, just a rainy day in Boston. But I happen to have moved into downtown Boston to go to work for Kevin White when he ran for mayor, and I had gotten prominent there working for Mayor White, and some friends said, "You know, you could probably get elected to the state legislature." And, uh, to my pleasant surprise, it turned out that was true. ♪♪ Well, stay right where you are and meet some wonderful people. And our first "wonderful people" is Barney Frank. Barney... We're now faced, in the city of Boston, with a very serious problem. We're confronting the question about whether or not, with an understaffed police force, with a tax rate that's going up over the roof, we can make this city safe for the voyeurs from Wellesley. When Barney ran for the state legislature, I remember two things vividly: one, his campaign slogan, which I believe was, "Neatness isn't everything." And, uh, Barney being Barney, uh, saying at one point that running for the state legislature is a great stepping stone if you're going down. When the government refused to recognize that the state would run out of money, Barney filed a bill to eliminate the month of February. And he said, "Lookit, February, no one likes it. "It's cold, it's ugly, "and it's only 28 days anyway, so people wouldn't notice if it were gone." So he introduced that. It was funny one day that a, um, legislator, who was from New Bedford, actually, and stood up and said, "I am just tired of this. The Congre-- "Barney Frank keeps introducing legislation, "one thing after another. "First, it was legalized prostitution. "Then it was legalized pornography. "Then it was legalized marijuana. And now it's gay rights." He said, "I just don't know what's coming next." And Barney stood up and he said, "I'm just gonna keep introducing bills "until I find something the gentleman from New Bedford likes." I became the first person in Massachusetts history to file gay rights legislation. Having still never told anyone that you are gay. Right. I said, "Well... "I don't have the courage to "acknowledge to people that I am gay. "But I will never participate in perpetuating the hypocrisy of being anti-gay." And what happened was there was the Homophile Union of Boston, which was the men, and the Daughters of Bilitis, or "Biletis," which was the women. And they sent out a joint questionnaire to legislators running for office in 1972, candidates for the Senate, that said, "Would you support gay rights?" And I-- I got to be the main sponsor by process of elimination. I was the only one who said yes. Ruth and her husband. This is the boys in the mountains. 15, 13, and their sister. That's the one you had lunch with. Yeah. From my point of view, I was impressed and intimidated by what Barney already knew about politics when he arrived there. You know, I had a vague idea that there was a bicameral legislature, and Barney knew which house the revenue bills have to originate in. What the jurisdiction of the various committees were. It was astonishing to me, and you weren't very secretive about what you knew, you know. For me, the thing about politics was, it was kind of a nice thing 'cause I was fascinated by it. And it was also kind of validated, it was important, it was good. So, you know, you could-- I could get into the minutiae of politics without feeling I was wasting my time, because, after all, this is, you know, this is governance, this is democracy. And part of our fun was constant arguing about politics. I had come from a very conservative background, and he was from a fairly liberal one. So... we didn't agree on much. You know, I always thought he won, but... I never would acknowledge it. I did notice that everybody at lunch and dinner wanted to sit at his table. So there would be 12, 14, 15 people all around with trays in their laps and stuff, and they all lived to do battle with Barney. Whatever that-- Barney would demolish them, one after another, and in ways that had them all laughing so hard. Everybody was on the floor. So there he was. He was so popular, but what I came to realize is he was so lonely. Barney never talked to me about being gay at Harvard. I wrote him a letter in which I told him that I was. And, uh, he was very tolerant in his response to me, but he didn't indicate that he was also. And I guess I told him in part 'cause I had a big crush on him. And when I came back to the room, he pointed-- Barney pointed to an ashtray and he said, "I burned the letter," to let me know, you know, that I didn't have to worry about it. And, um, I was disappointed because I'd hoped he would, you know, say, "Well, I am, too," and... things would develop. But he didn't, and they didn't, so that's life. And I was just shocked by it, didn't know how to handle it, and, uh, it was an indication of my emotional distress when Hastings gave me the letter saying he was a homosexual. I just ignored it. And you never-- you were just chaste, right? I mean, there-- the-- Yeah, no, I was, uh... afraid to tell anyone that I was gay. So I just avoided sexual activity, uh, because I was afraid to reveal myself. I assume you didn't tell your mom and dad. Oh, I told no one I was gay. I realized it when I was 13. It was something one of my friends said, which he was-- sort of said in jest, but I realized it was true, and it-- it, um, it just-- it sent a chill through me. It was terrifying, literally terrifying. I, uh, at that point resolved that I would never tell any other human being, um, about it. Why? Because, um... homosexuals were a despised minority. That I-- I had no reason to believe that anybody of any kind would be other than horrified. If you were a homosexual, there were all these pressures to act in a very stereotyped way, so there wasn't anybody you could point to or think of who was gay, although we weren't using that phrase then, who was anything like the way you wanted to be. And I do remember one thing that had a great impact on me was reading the book "Advise and Consent," which is about the Senate. And there's one promising young senator who is being courted by an FDR-like president, and when people find out he'd had a homosexual incident in his past-- he's now married with a kid-- uh, the only way out is to kill himself. Well, that was not an atmosphere conducive to my sharing the news. But in the late '70s, I started the retail coming out process. You tell this one, you tell that one, and the individual says to you, "Thank you for telling me and you shouldn't have worried." This is 30 years ago. I assume it's different now. "I love you and I care about you, "and you shouldn't have worried. "Why did you think anybody who loved you would care? "Why were you worried? There was no reason of concern. Don't tell your father." In 1980, Barney invited me to have breakfast at the Ritz in Boston, and he said, "I just want you to know I'm gay, and I'm gonna come out." And looking for my reaction. And... I said, "Well, I'm-- I'm not surprised, but I didn't know it." And I said I didn't think it was a great idea to come out at that time." If he wanted any political career, 1980 was not a good time to-- to come out. It turned out two months later, Father Drinan was told he could not run for Congress, and it gave an opportunity to Barney to run. I think if he had come out at that time, he would not have been able to get elected. He only had a few days to make his mind up. I was driving him and Barney said, "Oh, I don't know if I can run. I don't know if I can do that." And I think I have to think about it. And I said, "Well, you have about 15 minutes. "So fuck, think. You better-- You better decide by the time you get there." And, um... we got there, and he had decided that he would run. He was not happy in the state legislature. He was just contemplating coming out or not. He was on his 40th birthday. It was a pretty tough time for him. And this was the opportune time for him to make a major change. Everybody in Brookline, if they get a warning, it's supposed to go to New Hampshire. Well, if the Russians attack at rush hour, you can't get from Brookline to Copley Square. How we gonna get to New Hampshire? Pleased to see you. Nice to see you. He was a good candidate in the beginning because he didn't think he could win. He was loose, he was friendly. And once he won the primary, and then he could see he could actually win the congressional seat, he turned into a terrible candidate. We just wanted to send him out of the district, um... He was much better when he thought he was gonna lose. But when he thought he could win and he didn't want to see it slip away, he just became very tense and wouldn't really listen to staff and advisers. Sometimes, he'd alienate voters because he'd get gruff and short-tempered. He became a bear. And I-- I had al-- really encouraged him to run 'cause I thought he'd be a great congressman. And he was. Candidate, no. But congressman, yes. Just two hours after the polls closed in Massachusetts, Frank appeared before supporters to claim a big victory over the senior woman in Congress. He was winning by a surprising two-to-one margin. And I regard this not as a personal triumph but as a statement by the people of the 4th congressional district... I'd started to come out to people. I shut the closet door again to run for Congress. I never could have won if I was out. So I thought I could kind of be half in and half out. That means there's votes? I think I heard the vote bell. I'm sorry, Barney, I didn't get my bag. Teddy Roosevelt said the presidency was a bully pulpit. Well, so's the house. You've got a license to speak out on anything. Foreign policy, domestic policy, environmental policy, civil liberties, war, peace. It's an irresistible forum, I think. And you've got a license to go in and kind of do good. He'd call you on the phone and say, "Hey, take this number down, go see this woman in Fall River," or New Bedford or down in the southern part of his district. It was never, you know, the Newton part of his district. It was always people who really needed help. And, you know, you'd have to write really fast, 'cause he spoke really quickly. You know, "Take this number down." "You gotta repeat the number, Barney." I'm from New Jersey, but I'm Massachusetts. But it hasn't helped noticeably and I talk too fast. And only a statistically insignificant percentage of the people in Mississippi could understand what I was saying. Which limited my youthfulness as a community organizer. My first political motivation was when Emmett Till was murdered. Emmett Till was murdered at the age of 14 in 1954, when I was 14. He was a black guy from Chicago who had whistled at or looked a white woman the wrong way, and he was murdered. And, uh, the sheriff was in on the murder. And that was my first real understanding of how vicious the racism was in parts of America and Mississippi. He got off the plane and he walked right over to the water fountain marked "colored" and drank out of it. If anyone has the temerity to suggest that this election isn't gonna have as a major component in it the question of who is responsible... Better than anybody I have ever met, he had a strategic sense about how you brought about change. And one of the great strengths Al had was he would say to you, "Boy, I bet you're really mad about what's going on in Mississippi," and you'd say, "Yeah." And he would then spin out something you could do about it. If you've ever experienced the sense of being left out, that, uh, perhaps you identify more easily with people who seem left out, and you want to do what you can to ease those problems for other people. 'Cause you see something of yourself in them. He just believes, as a matter of absolute faith, that, uh, you owe something to other people. And that you'd in fact feel a lot better about it if you did. Politics was his passion from the get-go. And it was not just the game of politics. He had strong convictions. Um, he believed in helping the poor. He believed in helping minorities. He came from a family of people that cared about the world and what was going on. People can't find jobs, they can't afford to go to college. They can't buy homes. They can't even look forward to a secure retirement. That's why I'm fighting hard to make the economy work for average people. Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem. The thing that bothers me most about the Reagan program is its unfairness. It just isn't fair to say to a 70-year-old man or woman who's worked all of his or her life, "We're cutting your Medicare. We're gonna make you pay more when you get sick." And then turn around and give a tax break to the oil companies. He comes to the floor extremely well prepared. He knows the issues that affect the area. He's a man of thought and concern and care. He had a long run, and it's good that it's over. And the main reason is... He's the face of American liberalism and he's sort of, in many ways, the face of the failure of American liberalism. Hanging on to the gains of the New Deal and the Great Society in the face of an entirely new world where it's not appropriate. I think Barney is a New Dealer, but it is appropriate. New Dealer doesn't mean... government that's bigger than it should be. It means understanding that government can do and must do and should do certain critical things. And it worked. Let's not kid ourselves-- it worked for an awfully long time, until the forces that opposed it took it apart. And, lo and behold, what happened? Cataclysm... at every level. In terms of income distribution, job creation, median family income, rise in poverty, decline of literacy. I don't care what metric you use, society began to fall apart when we took apart the pieces of the New Deal. What is a liberal? Everybody doesn't... You have one party that tends to be more public sector, and one that's more private-- pro-private sector, but they both recognize the value of the other sector. And the politics is over where you draw the line. And the liberals are generally more on the side of a greater public sector, and the conservatives on a greater private sector. And what's a progressive? A progressive is a liberal who doesn't want to admit it. The principle that we should go to general revenues for Medicare, that 80-year-old sick women are more important than 40-year-old outdated battleships is an important choice that we ought to make here today. Now, Mr. Speaker, perhaps, in the spirit of compromise, we can work something out. Maybe what we can do under the senior aid program is to arm the elderly. Perhaps if we gave each one of them an M-16... In 1981, Barney Frank's colleagues named him Rookie of the Year in Congress. They were impressed with how Barney chopped millions of dollars in wasteful farm subsidies. How he helped stop the Republicans from cutting Social Security. How he opposed the Reagan tax program because it favored the rich over average people. And how he even stood up to a Democratic tax plan that favored big oil. Barney Frank, the best new congressman in Washington. In 1982, I had this tough race because of redistricting. I was 42 years old and unmarried, so inferences were drawn. The campaign being run against me had me as the kind of person who didn't understand family values. It was back when homophobia reigned supreme. Uh, his time in public life mirrors the period that America has gone through. So there were years when he served where he couldn't be true about who he was. He was in public life, and yet he had a private life that he couldn't even talk about. I came out to integrate my lives. I was having a very good public career and an increasingly unhappy private life. And it bothered me-- I would go to these parties, and I would, you know, watch everybody else having the emotional as well as political fun. I could only have the political fun. I was a closeted member of Congress for seven years. Being a closeted member of Congress is no way to live. Every human being has emotional and physical needs, and if you deny them, I think that makes it worse. At one point in 1986, a gay Republican former congressman who'd been one of these closeted anti-gay conservatives, Bob Bauman, wrote a book and he repented of his anti-gay activity. And in the book, he outed me. Why did you do that? I regret doing that. But, frankly, I thought that that was something that was known. And I went to Tip O'Neill and said, "I want you to know that there's gonna be-- "there's a book out that, you know, says that I'm gay." And he said, "Oh, Barney, don't be listening to that B.S. "I mean, they're always spreading those rumors about us-- who cares?" I said, "Well, the problem, Tip, is that it's true." The Speaker of the House, Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, who loved Barney, thought Barney actually had a chance to be the first Jewish Speaker of the House. He was smart and his leadership capacity was so great. So Barney, with great fear in his soul, I'm sure, approached the speaker to tell him. Tip was always garbling the English language, God love him. He said, "I gotta tell you something, old pal." And I said, "What?" He said, "Barney Frank came in to see me the other day. He's all done in politics." I said, "What are you talking about?" "He's all done." I said, "Wh-wh-what do you mean he's all done in politics?" He said, "Well... he's gonna have "a press conference next week, and he's gonna tell people he's coming out of the room." Come out of the room, not the closet. They... figured-- didn't know what the hell he was talking about until they sussed out that he meant "the closet." 25 years ago today, Democratic congressman from Massachusetts Barney Frank chose to publicly reveal that he is gay. I just want to thank all the people in this room for... ...that's made this possible for me. The day he came out, I just got right on the phone. And I said, "Barney, "I-- first, let me tell you, I'm very proud of you "to see that you did that. "That takes a lot of guts. And that's what you have." I just remember he said, "Yeah," he said, "I haven't had a lot of calls today." In Washington today, the House of Representatives meted out its most lenient punishment to Congressman Barney Frank. Congressman Frank... Specifically, what does that mean? What happens when you're reprimanded? Uh, this is an institution about which I care a lot. It's part of a process about which I care a lot. And what it will mean is that there will be a permanent record that, uh, in this respect, in that period, I fell short of the standard that, uh, that I think I've otherwise lived up to. Now, I felt that the Ethics Committee really treated him unfairly, in my estimation. Um, and, uh, I was one of the few Republicans that actually voted against the recommendations of the Ethics Committee. Gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Frank is recognized for five minutes. I think members here will agree that I've had a reputation for honesty. Not always tact or... tolerance, but honesty. There was, in my life, a central element of dishonesty. For about 40 years. He was just obsessed with it and embarrassed by it and hurt by it. Had he not gone into politics, he could have lived his gay life openly much sooner and with far fewer restrictions. One time I stopped and I said to him, "How much time do you put on this job?" And he looked at me and he said, "It consumes all of my life." He says, "I spend all of my time on my job." It is a sacrifice for anyone. And Barney made that sacrifice. Certainly he postponed happiness in order to serve the public. Barney's told me about reading accounts of Sam Rayburn-- his brief marriage, his apparent loneliness, his years of bachelorhood. And Barney knows no more than that, but he said you could just read between the lines that this was a very closeted gay man who couldn't have a life. Perhaps that was in his mind when he realized he just didn't want to be that... that lonely man. Thank you, I just had - Which dances-- Who should be dancing, you know, when he starts her off. Like, Jim and I dance first and then who-- who joins in and... Well, usually then the bridal party joins in. After, um... It's so big, it'll be the whole dance floor. I know. Here's the DJ worksheet. "Special events songs. Must play these songs. Must not play these songs." Right. "Under no circumstances, even by guest request." An Elvis Presley song, um, "Wise Men." Yeah, yeah. I can't think of the name of that. ♪ The wise men ♪ What's the name of that? I don't know the name of it. No, I didn't realize I had a terrible voice. I-- when I was like five or six, I did record "McNamara's Band" in one of these studios. It was just... it was God-awful. And then, actually, somewhat traumatically, in the second grade, we sang on stage, my second grade class, "My Old Kentucky Home." And I just loved it and I was belting away. And Mrs. Doyle, who's a lovely lady, who was this teacher, kinda gently suggested to me that I-- I just move my lips. I was so bad, I was keeping everybody off. The other-- oh, the other thing, though, is that-- just a sign of how you can make progress in so many ways, "My Old Kentucky Home" is a terribly racist song. I've gotta ask you-- I'm looking at the ring, it's black. I've never seen a black engagement ring. Well, it's tungsten. Yeah, it's our engagement ring. Jim is a, uh-- puts up awnings for a living. He does welding as part of it. And he picked tungsten probably 'cause he knows I tend to break things. He said tungsten is a very durable, very hard metal. And so that's why he picked the tungsten rings. So, Jim, I wanna ask you, um, how has it been for you? I mean, you've really been thrust into the limelight. I fell in love with him in spite of all this, I guess, you know? Not because of, in spite of? Right. Yeah. Jim's been welcome, uh... and as a great... Into the wives' club. Yes! Have you? I just won't staple up to like there. Okay. He's on his way or... Yeah, well, yeah, he's probably about out of the airport now. And there's probably pretty heavy traffic. Does he got a ride or is he driving himself? Himself. Hi, Nana. Hi, how are you? Good. Still raining? Uh, it just stopped. It was raining very lightly and then it, uh, it slowed down. Jim upstairs? Yeah. Hello. Hey, Barney. Hey there. Hi. There's very little traffic. Just a little from like Charlestown. Looks like everybody got out of town because... I was pulling out of the garage at 25 after 5:00. Yeah. And I'm here. Wow, that's good. Wow. Funny, I used to listen to these songs about love. And I would never-- I'd never, they were all so-- Like, "Ugh." They didn't mean anything to me. I would almost be kind of annoyed by them, you know? It was like I was left out. The whole thing takes on a meaning it didn't have. Right in the middle, okay? Very good, Mother. Want some butter? I got this at Stop and Shop this morning. Barney, did you want this cheese? I used it already. All right. Only 87,700. I've had it for 14 years, I-- It's a Ford Escort. It's a great little car. It's the last one they ever made. What year? '98. It's... I love it. It has no-- it has the minimum number of moving parts to be a car. Nothing's automatic. Nothing can get broken. I know it's-- it's an engine and four wheels and a steering wheel, and that's it. Well, first of all, I think Barney, deep down, is a shy person. He's uncomfortable in social situations. Taking a peek at the newspaper or... I remember one time, I brought the CEO of a major financial firm, and Barney walks out of the cloakroom, honest to Pete, neither shoe was tied, the shirt tail was hanging out, and he had his tie kind of about halfway, half-staff, you know? His hair wasn't combed, he didn't have his glasses on, he couldn't see mu-- I think he's just-- he's a 72-year-old man who's not tweeting, who's not on Facebook, and doesn't use an iPhone. Uh, he's reading the hardcopy of "The New York Times." And, you know, but that's who he is. Well, I should've known there are certain things that are hereditary. You know these are considered very old-fashioned? I know. You and I have them. People have said, "Well, what if I need to get to you in an emergency?" But I do have a cell phone, but it's off much of the time. I do not know CPR. I cannot make bail. So if people have an emergency, they should call someone who can help them. How are you? It's so nice to see you. They told me I'm getting an award, that they would validate our parking. Are you doing validating parking? They would validate the parking ticket. Okay. You know who does that? You should have got complimentary parking. But I have the ticket... Well, give it to me and I'll make sure we get it taken care of. All right, thank you. But you should have it valeted. Mr. Frank, for each individual closing, Please answer my question. Does HUD keep a record of it? I don't know why you would tell me that, that's not what I asked. Now, wait a minute. You know, I'm sorry, but this nonsense is gonna stop. That's a very simple question susceptible to an answer. And I would like the answer. Sometimes people perceived him as, you know, this liberal Massachusetts Congressman who may be too left for what's going on here, but he always wanted to legislate. And that's what made him different than some of the other liberals is he has a, obviously, a core and a progressive belief, but he also wanted to get a bill signed. I'm good at legislating. You know, I'm not good at a whole lot of other things. Legislating is a kind of a very peculiar business. And it just happened to be something that I'm good at. But, you know, there is a sense, Barney, which you were then and are now, impatient with people who aren't as smart as you are. And who don't see all the implications of a particular policy choice or whatever kind of choice right-- right from the top. I agree with that. But particularly with people on the left, and I think that's fair, right? I, uh, if I think-- And I get particularly angry when people seem to me to be taking strategic or even tactical differences and making them into moral differences. But I've had to be-- be careful of that. So you are disagreeing with me because you think it's easy. I know that. I talk to them all the time. I had a client I took in who he agreed with. And, uh, you know, we were literally in there for five minutes and-- and Barney agreed with him. And then the client started to try and thank him, and Barney was like, "Okay, we're done. "I told you I agreed with you, now go talk to somebody who disagrees with you." Patience, in my judgment, is not a virtue. People want to waste my time. People want to tell me the same thing four times over. People want to tell me what they should've known, I already knew. Barney's tough on his enemies, but he's way tougher on his friends. Columbus Day weekend. When none of the members of Congress were in town. And I said I thought the march was a waste of time. It's a month before the election. People who care about public policy should be back in the places where they live, try to get people to turn out to vote, try to influence the vote. And they said, "Well, don't you think by coming to Washington, they're going to be putting a lot of pressure on Congress?" And I said, "The only thing they're putting pressure on is the grass." I mean, I... I was one of the organizers of the march on Washington. I was one of the final speakers in the march on Washington. And it was not helpful. And I didn't understand why he did that. So, yeah, I think he was looking at it from the perspective of, "Hey, are you actually gonna change votes on Capitol Hill?" But that wasn't the real point. The point to me was to wake up a new generation and to get them to coalesce and to focus on the federal government so we can start acting like a real civil rights fight. And he pisses me off sometimes when he says, "I can't do that, I don't have the votes. Get realistic." You know, sometimes we don't like the people who give us the bad news. But I don't think you can overestimate his role here in the Congress in terms of the gay community. Both as a mentor to a lot of us who worked here, who saw that you could be an openly gay member of Congress. Just the fact that he came out of the closet and was in the room. I live with another man when I'm in Washington-- obviously, not in Massachusetts. We're having a family brunch when I leave here for about 16-- his parents, my sisters, brother, my four-year-old niece Madeline. I don't think she's gonna be damaged by being in our house. I don't understand what it is that threatens them. When I came to work here in 1986, you know, on the Democratic side, you still sort of wondered, "Should I tell someone I'm gay? "What if they find out I'm gay? What's that gonna do to my career?" And I met Barney sometime in the '80s, and I was being interviewed to be Dick Gephardt's chief of staff, who was the majority leader of the Congress. And I went to see Barney, and I said, "Well, should I tell him I'm gay?" And, you know, Barney in his very, you know-- Barney doesn't sit and think about it and look at you and, you know, ponder it. He looked at me, and he goes, "No!" And I said, "Why not?" He goes, "'Cause he's not interviewing you "to be his gay chief of staff. He's interviewing you to be his chief of staff." Today, looking at the electoral victories we just had and looking at the fact that we're gonna have a gay senator and we're gonna have seven gay members of Congress, you'd think this is easy. But in the '80s, early '90s, it was very hard. I would like to apologize to Congressman Frank on behalf of all Republicans for what Dick Armey said when he actually called him Barney Fag. And I don't need to listen to Barney Fag-- Barney Frank haranguing in my ear..." He then tried to say he didn't say it. He said, "Oh, it was a mispronunciation. I meant to say 'Frank,' and it came out 'Fag.'" So, I said, "My mother reports that in forty-something years, no one has ever referred to her as Elsie Fag. How could I be so sure that Barney will do the right thing by us older people? Because he's my son. The bigots like to talk about gay men and lesbians as if we were rootless and had no sense of community and had no sense of values. I do not think there is a more moving example of social responsibility towards individuals themselves and towards other individuals than that of the gay and lesbian community in response to the AIDS crisis. And it's particularly relevant, I think, to look at the role here of lesbians, because they are not themselves a population that is at high risk. It is an honorable compromise that advances the cause of people who are called to serve our country by their patriotism..." Well, it's not an acceptable one to me. It falls short of what I thought was necessary. But a majority of young black people who are enlisted have said that they don't want to be forced to serve with a homosexual. And a majority of white people in 1948 would have said that they wouldn't have integrated the military. I don't think you can call those young black people bigoted, Barney. Who did? I don't think you can. No, I called you bigoted. Well, I don't think you can... The Honorable Barney Frank of Massachusetts. Gentleman is recognized for five minutes. How does the fact that I love another man and live in a committed relationship with him threaten your marriage? It was not just that he was out and gay. It was that he was out and by God he'd fight you. Are you that timid? Are you that frightened? I'll yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma if he'll tell me what threatens his marriage. Absolutely. It threatens the institution of marriage that we're trying to redefine. It doesn't threaten his marriage. It doesn't threaten anybody else's marriage. It threatens the institution of marriage. That argument ought to be made by someone in an institution. Gay, straight, black, white, same struggle... And I think particularly on the gay issues it was a unique understanding of the role he had, of the life he led, and how hard it was for him, and that there were a bunch of people younger who he could be an example to. And as a young man who had just finished college and not been out at the time, Barney's coming out provided me space. He gave more people space to come out in their own way, not just as public servants, but as just gay and lesbian Americans. I think he'll be seen as somebody who was a tireless champion. I mean, he just never stopped on the question. He would never let up. School systems in this country, when they have sought to teach people that hatred is wrong, we are told, "No, no, you can't do that." Because if the schools did that, they would be promoting homosexuality, and it would lead to acceptance of homosexuality. Well, it had always struck me as a gay man what nonacceptance meant. And now we know. We just saw two young men demented and driven to a subhuman state by a vicious prejudice who couldn't accept Matthew Shepard being a gay man, so they beat him brutally and left him to die. Yes, we are prepared to say that you must accept our right to live, our right to physical security, our right to the freedom that any human being is entitled to. And we... A lot of what I give Barney credit for is, before the time came, he was always in there keeping the issues alive, and, you know, Barney always knew that there would-- that the moment was coming and that it was just a matter of time. Second floor. Going down. First of all, and the only thing that justifies doing it, is that you get a chance to improve the country you live in. If you don't have strong feelings about ways to make the country better, then you should go out and do something else. And I've had a chance to participate in ways to make the country better or in some cases to keep other people from making it worse, which can have the same effect. Secondly for me, it's the kind of stuff I'm good at. All of us, we're a mix of talents and weaknesses. I'm good at thinking on my feet, for example. Even on the intellectual area, I have kind of a short attention span. But when things are scrambled, when you have to deal with a lot of different things at once, that tends to be one of my strengths. So I hate to prepare. I get bored. But the nice thing about my job is you don't get a chance to prepare, so I'm not at a disadvantage. And what I've looked for were people who have understood the importance of combining pragmatism and idealism, who were zealous about principle but also insistent on implementing that principle. ...want transparency. And it's the secrecy that I don't like and we have a right to know... You were very responsible with the question. I admired that. I'm very-- yeah, yeah. Good for you. Yeah, I didn't say... 'Cause we cleaned it up pretty much. Yeah. Listen, I thought-- I don't think we ought to slam on the brakes on spending, and I think it would be crazy, and particularly right now. It's just not the time. Oh, the business community will hate you. You and I probably agree. You know, we might not agree how to reform health care... We served together for 20 years on financial services. So we go back a long way. We respected each other. I know I respected him. When he gave his word, he kept it. But we had a good time. We disagreed on a lot of policy, but we didn't let that interfere with the professional working relationship.

His name was Henny Youngman. He was actually one of the great comedians of the Borscht Belt era. I lost my first wife in a wishing well. I didn't know they worked. Most comedians used to make wife jokes and mother-in-law jokes, et cetera, but he had one joke that was-- He was the king of the one-liners, he was called. He had one joke that was very funny and very profound. "How's your wife?" "Compared to what?" Oh! That's the context in which I make every political decision. Compared to what?

Once or twice I would point out something in a bill and he would say, "I don't know where you got that," you know, "This is crazy," you know or... And then his staff would lean over and point. But he was able in mid-stream to change from, "That's not in there," to, "This is why it's in there." So, he was very flexible. But I didn't take that personally. It's sort of like football. I mean, it's a contact sport. All we ask is time for the taxpayers and the people of America to read the bill. The bill under consideration is 5 1/2 pages. I believe even the gentleman from Texas could have read it by now. My colleagues on the other side have decided to adopt a Marxist idea. The Marx in question, of course, is Chico. Point of order. Is the rule that we're operating under coming out of the rule committee? Point of orders rarely end with a question mark. I've never heard one that did. How many times did I distinguish-- No, "how many times" could not conceivably be a point of order. My point of order is, the distinguished speaker numerous times made points of order. Comments on the past behavior of the speaker might be interesting, but they are not points of order. I can't-- Honestly, I could not imagine for a minute Barney Frank being in the Senate. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Does whining come out of my time? With all respect, I think that is an unfair question, and the reason I do-- All right, then I'll withdraw it. Mr. Starr, you're the expert on unfair questions. If you tell me it's an unfair question, I'll withdraw it. So, let me ask you again. Did anybody on your staff to your knowledge give out that information? So, I mean, if you didn't do any of the leaking, why don't you just tell us? The silence with respect to anything else means necessarily that we had not concluded-- In other words, don't have anything to say unless you have something bad to say. What's the exculpatory evidence he's gonna bring in? A February calendar saying, "Oh, my God, Monica and I finally did it today." 'Cause he will not go over the amendments. We'll get to see a motion to strike, whatever you call it. Just-- well, unless they do it. If they divide the question, we'll go up and down. Then we don't have any motions. I mean, he he knows the rules of the House and committee, and he will stop the opposition in their tracks when they try something. I want to see Chief Justice Rehnquist sitting there while the senators try to guess under which pea you have concealed the impeachment. The president was understandably embarrassed. He had private sexual activity that he wanted to conceal, and he lied about it, and that is a subject, as an expert on which, I fully understand. I would tell you that having been reprimanded by this House of Representatives where I'm so proud to serve, was no triviality. Having behaved stupidly kept me from getting indignant about Clinton. Some of my friends, I thought some were hypocritical. They would say, "Oh, we're so angry at him." Well, I had been there, and I thought many of them had been too, and I thought that was wholly inappropriate. And I also was able to be sort of self-denigratory, which is always helpful. Oh, go ahead. Why should you be different? The, um... Well, I don't know why I'm different, Mr. Chairman, but I just am. And also I could-- You know, I was a poster child for the fact that people who had done things like Clinton hadn't been driven out. No impeachment! No impeachment! Hello. How are ya? Thank you. Thank you. The era of big government is over. It is a good piece of legislation for setting forth the conditions for the financial services industry central to capitalism. It's a good situation in which the intermediation function of the financial services industry can go forward... ...that improve the conditions for wealth to be generated, and I am for that. I would vote for this bill if we were talking simply about these conditions and no other were relevant. The New Deal stuff worked very well for 50 years. The mistake that the country made was, by the '80s, the deregulatory philosophy at that time was so deeply rooted that it took us 15 years more than we should have to come up with a new set of rules. We are talking here about an entity-- home ownership, homes-- where there is not the degree of leverage that we have seen elsewhere. This is not the dot-com situation. We have problems with people having invested in business plans for which there was no reality. But you're not going to see the collapse that you see when people talk about a bubble. Things have clearly changed. 'Cause Barney and I had a meeting when I first took over and I told Barney, I said, "I think you and I share the same goals." And he said, "Absolutely." And I said, "You're probably gonna take some heat "on your side. "I'm probably gonna take some heat on my side, "but I'm willing to do that "in return for-- "I want to look back after my tenure and say 'We actually accomplished something.'" When I became ranking member of the full committee on financial services under Mike Oxley, I had a very cooperative relationship with him for four years. We worked very closely together. When I became chairman, for the first year that was the relationship I had with Spencer Bachus. Spencer's got kind of a good popular streak, and he wanted to work with us on, for instance, ending subprime mortgages. So, during 2007, we cooperated a lot. I remember subprime lending. Had Barney and I had our way, we would have had a subprime lending bill in 2005, and I can't imagine what a difference that would have made in 2006, 2007, when the bulk of those bad loans were made. He got in trouble with the extreme conservatives, the Republican Study Committee, and they complained about him to the Republican leadership on the grounds that he'd been too collaborative with us. And that's when people said, "Oh, what's it been like?" I can tell you it's the right-wing Republican takeover. It got bad in 2008. Then, of course, when the Tea Party took over, it got totally bad. And it's not that Spencer doesn't want to cooperate. It is that he has basically been told he can't. There's much more partisanship. There's fewer personal relationships. There's probably less respect for the institution. The Constitution established, Article I, the legislative branch, and I think that what I call Chairman Frank and I both respected the institution. We respected every member. We respected their ability to speak. And I think that's a commodity that's too scarce in today's Congress. We would not have had the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 if it weren't for Republicans. These were principled idealists. We used to have a lot of them in both parties. Compromise and common ground, that's what Barney has represented. The idea of Congress, and I think you don't have to be a student of the Federalist period to figure it out, is you get to know each other, you negotiate, you perhaps have a drink together. This is the way it's been since they wrote the Declaration, they wrote the Constitution. They get together. It was that way up until fairly recently, because Newt Gingrich came to Congress in '78 and was angered shortly thereafter when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan talked about their cooperation. He said, "Let's be very clear. The Democrats are corrupt. They are treasonous." Et cetera. What we're now seeing is the ultimate triumph of that. You have... Newt devised the strategy-- we need to create enough of a level of disgust with Congress that people say, "This is so awful, anything would be better than this." And he began a systematic process to make that happen. It took him 16 years. Recruited this vast group of people in the '90s who came in with the idea that government is evil, we're gonna clean the place out, we're gonna get rid of government, it's us against them, it's warfare. You don't consort with the enemy. And it works. If you decide you're gonna bring the entire institution down around you, you can win elections. Well, let me ask you about that. Should the American people continue to have faith in a Congress which, as you describe and so many others say, is dysfunctional? Well, by the way, Judy, where do you think this Congress came from? You'd be surprised how few members of the House of Representatives parachuted in through the dome. Every one of the commissions is... I think I was pretty good at being a legislator, but to my disappointment, the kind of inside work I have felt best at is not gonna be as productive for the foreseeable future and not until we make some changes. And it's true, by the way, that jobs for women have lagged-- Oh, I have to correct that. That is-- I'm sorry, may I continue, George? George, George, what she wants to do and what all the Republicans want to do is no regulation at all. Miss Blackburn-- Now, now, Barney, I didn't speak for you. You don't speak for me. No, you're trying to speak for me. I will not allow you to do that. This pattern of interruption and filibuster is really not a good way to discuss important issues. Well, I haven't had to do that in a while. Haven't asked me to kill their mics in a while. I'm really angry at Stephanopoulos. That was ridiculous. He just lets her interrupt and filibuster, and then I don't know, you know, what you're supposed to do, but it's really very disappointing. I'd like to send an e-mail back. Do you have that number? Um... If you don't, never mind. I'll tell him. But we're always engaged in the fight, but you take a minute and look back at the fights of 20 and 30 years ago, there's real progress. There is this danger. We're now facing for the first time with the Tea Party the real possibility of gains being reversed. Come on, you coward! Say the truth! What do you mean, coward? You're a coward! You blame everybody else! May I talk, Bill? Here's the problem with going on your show. You start ranting, and the only way to respond is almost to look as boorish as you. I listen to that audio, and it makes my blood pressure go up. You seem to thrive on it. Well, in the moment, yes, but over time, no. Look, um, I-- I fight hard for public policy. People have said, "How would you feel-- You were the chairman of that committee for four years." I was at the center of this financial crisis. I would have the secretary of the treasury and the head of the federal reserve under George Bush calling up and saying, "Look, things are about to collapse. We got to work this thing out." So, in any given moment, you rise to the occasion. It's very rare to find someone like Barney, who understood the political process and also understood markets. I thought the most important thing for future historians would be the working relationship that I had with Barney and the way that Democrats worked with Republicans, really coming together at a time of crisis. Now, Mr. Secretary, I have to interrupt you. We had a few differences. We had differences over using TARP funds to modify mortgages and where I had a tough hearing with Barney. Would you agree, Mr. Secretary, that in fact the bill does authorize aggressive action not simply to buy out mortgages, but diminish foreclosures? A lot of progressive Dems, particularly in the House, didn't like the idea of just shoveling taxpayer money into these giant banks who had brought on this financial crisis because of their recklessness. Barney speaks his mind and isn't necessarily afraid of the consequences and actually led this resistance that they weren't going to do it unless there was some commitment to help homeowners. The bill is replete with authorization to you not simply to buy out mortgages... He waved the TARP legislation in front of me and said, you know, "We asked you to do more mortgage relief, and I'm very unhappy." I first met him in January of 2009. It was a remarkably important moment in the history of our agency of SIGTARP. And we had learned that our surveys were gonna be blocked. This was the new Obama administration. And I got this news just as I was walking into Barney Frank's office. So I explained to him what had happened, and he just picked up the phone-- "Tell 'em Barney Frank's on the phone." And then he's just screaming into that phone about "How dare you obstruct the special inspector general trying to bring transparency," just really abusing what we presumed was somebody's voice mail. He then hangs up the phone, looks up, sort of gives a grin, almost a smirk, and says, "Geithner," referring to the secretary of the treasury. He goes, "That should take care of it. Let us know if not, and we'll get on it." He's the person who people go to to figure out strategy and "what should we do." And so he had a deep knowledge of how to get things done. This was taken by Jim like 6:00 in the morning on a Friday. He had come down on Thursday night. 'Cause they asked us to come down to be there when we finished the bill, and it just took all night. He spent all night eating a couple of pieces of cold pizza, sitting on a folding chair, and a lot of people had gone home, so he got the only picture of-- all those guys went home-- of Chris and I. You see, I think, a lot of emotion. Like, he's biting his lip, I've got my lips-- I mean, it was a very emotional time. We'd just finished signing the bill. And the, like elation, you know, there. Yeah, we knew we'd just done something very historic. Tomorrow marks the two-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank being signed into law. Many of the reforms were suggested by House financial services chairman Barney Frank. For the last year, Chairman Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have worked day and night. At the time, President Obama called it the toughest financial reform since the ones created in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The law was passed over near-total Republican opposition. When you hear Barney Frank take absolutely no blame at all for the financial crisis and Fannie and Freddie, what's your reaction? I wouldn't say that Barney Frank is the most responsible American for this financial crisis, but I'd put him in maybe the top three or four. Well, I think you're misplacing blame here. I mean, Barney Frank I'd have on my list, but maybe in the top thousand, top ten thousand. One of the great distortions was to blame liberals in general, advocates of fairness to the poor, me in particular, with the housing crisis. You described in "Reckless Endangerment" a type of... relationships. I mean, it's as if-- It's as if you were being celebrated for what Fannie did... When anyone tried to reign in Fannie Mae, you know, reduce the threat to the taxpayer that these companies pose, that there were people in place to reject that idea. In the book they argue that the root of the financial crisis lies in President Clinton's decision to heavily promote home ownership in the '90s and the lowering of lending standards by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'm amazed when I go around the country and talk to people, the number of times I hear that Democrats caused the financial crisis, that this was all the fault of the government forcing lenders to make loans to people who couldn't pay them back, whether it's via the Community Reinvestment Act or via Fannie and Freddie, the GSEs. And if you look at the financial crisis honestly, then you have to say something in the market failed. As a matter of fact, Barney was very helpful. We passed a bill, uh, GSE reform, in '05, when nobody thought we could do it. We had opposition from the White House. We had opposition from Alan Greenspan at the Fed. Barney helped me put together a coalition that we passed the bill in committee by a three-to-one margin, a very strong bill, and it's unfortunate, but had it not been for Barney, I could have never gotten that bill to the floor. I wanted to go to the floor, and we kept getting jerked around by the leadership, Republican leadership. They don't want it to be known that they killed that bill. There's nothing in here about Fannie and Freddie. So this is the great pattern of my Republican colleagues. When they are in the minority, they know exactly what to do on tough issues. When they're the majority, they get Parliamentary Alzheimer's and they forget. You're very strong about offering things when you're sure they're not gonna get adopted. And then you get power and you choke. You're like the dog that caught the bus and you burned your mouth on the exhaust pipe. You're like the guy in the bar, "Let me at him, let me at him." And then your friend lets go of your coat, and you run out of the bar. I thank the gentlemen for yielding. I think people loved to blame Fannie and Freddie and the GSE's for the housing crisis because they want to blame the government. And they want to blame the government because to blame the market, that's a big challenge to their religion, right? So if they can say instead, "Oh, no, no, nothing went wrong. "This was all caused by Fannie and Freddie. "This was all government intervention. The market functioned exactly as it should." Then you get to keep your religion. JP Morgan shocks the financial world by revealing a $2 billion derivatives lose from a London-based trader. Here we go all over again. What do you think we're getting today? Look, look, Barney Frank is far from a perfect individual. But his name is on this law. And I would think if anybody cares about this thing being implemented in anything like the way he originally intended, this is part of that moment to do it. But I think you should all take comfort in the fact that all American banks are better capitalized, the system is far stronger today. Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Dimon, but that wasn't the question I asked. But I also said that we'd be solidity profitable this quarter, so relative to earn-- That's not the question, Mr. Dimon, please don't filibuster. They want to be protected so they can continue to do that. And Dodd-Frank pisses them off to the core. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I asked specific questions. Mr. Dimon well knows what we're talking about. Let me ask you, you did say finally that there would be some clawbacks. Is your compensation on the table for consideration of clawbacks? This was an object lesson. Banking is too important and too crucial to be left up to the bankers. This is a reaffirmation of the need for rules to be in place that keep mistakes like this from having further negative consequences. For example, we want to put some safeguards in there. We want to make sure that if you make a mistake, you pay for the mistake and it does not lead to the kind of contagion and the implosion that we had before. That is from reverberating in a negative way throughout the economy. You're welcome. A stout defense of the Dodd-Frank law and the sense that Barney Frank has that, hey, it's a bad thing that a private company lost money, but nobody freaked out. And one of the reasons that didn't freak out is because we had this new infrastructure. My name is Barney Frank, and I am calling about the, uh, vote on election day on public issue one, on marriage equality, and wondering if you made up your mind how you're gonna vote. She hasn't made up her mind, she didn't have time to talk, which means she's probably a no. I think my calling is of a mixed blessing. We're going together? Oh, thank you. Joe has accomplished a very significant feat. He has ameliorated Jewish guilt. Hi, boy. Good to see you. When you look at how far right the Republicans have gone, and then you look at Joe Kennedy-- and I'm very grateful to Joe, with a lot of career choices open to him, for deciding to get into politics at a time when, frankly, it's not being treated as well as it should. A willingness on a part of somebody like Joe to make life better for people who are hurting, to provide some fairness in this economy, to make sure that a level of public services are there, to fight against unfair treatment, to make sure that our resources aren't squandered in military activity that was misguided, but instead we can put it to work here where we need it. But I leave you with this overwhelming slogan, "Vote Democratic-- we're not perfect, but they're nuts." Thank you. How do you follow Barney Frank? Trying to meet some folks, this older gentlemen walks by. I stick my hand out, and I said, "Hi, sir, my name's Joe Kennedy. I'm running for office." And he goes, "Yeah, I know." Hmm. Well, that's terrifying. And I said, "Well, sir, you got any advice? I just got in the race and I'd like to do it right." And he kind of scowled at me and said, "Yeah, there's one thing you can do to be the best advocate for this district." "Okay, sir, well, what's that?" "Convince Barney Frank to run for re-election." Mixed emotions, it's very nice to have people be as supportive as they were. Um, I'm happy with my decision. I'm just-- I'm tired and I'm worn out and I couldn't keep going, but obviously there are things I'll miss. These are people who have for 20 years have been a very important part of my life. They've been not just constituents, they're friends, they're supporters, they're advisors. And I will miss the chance to work together with them to improve the lives of the people here. He's a good man. He fights for the working people. Good-- good man. What-- President just came out for same-sex marriage. I think that changed a lot of the dynamic, him coming out for marriage, but I don't think he would have come out for marriage if it wasn't for the constant prodding and pressure from people in the community and people like Barney. What does this mean to you personally that the president did this today? Well, I'm very pleased. Um, I'm getting married in a couple months. Uh, when I was 15, when I was 35, even when I was 55-- Yeah. If someone had said to me, "You know what? "You're gonna be retiring from Congress, "you'll have been chairman of a very important committee, "you'll have done some very significant work "in the field of financial services, and you're gonna get married to man whom you love very much." As a member of Congress, I would've been disbelieving. So, yeah, that means a great deal for me. And I would say it makes me feel even better about my country that this is country that has the capacity to deal with issues in a constructive way and help things get better for all of us. Appreciate it. Thank you. I think he's one of those people who fights for the right reasons-- because he believes it. His-- he has an ego like anybody-- nobody who gets elected to Congress who doesn't have an ego. Nobody goes into politics who doesn't have an ego. But I-- I've watched Barney over 20 years, and I don't think it was really about Barney. It was about the people. It was about where came from. And I think his speech on the floor-- the other great, you know-- most important Barney moment that I remember was his speech on the floor on ENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And, you know, this was when Barney was chairmen of the House Financial Services Committee. And it was a very emotional speech which, you know, surprised people, I think, because you don't expect Barney to be emotional. I used to be someone subjected to this prejudice. And through luck, circumstance, I got to be a big shot. I'm now above that prejudice. But I feel an obligation to 15-year-olds dreading to go to school because of the torments, to people afraid they'll lose their job at a gas station if someone finds out who they love. I feel an obligation to use the status I have been lucky enough to get to help them. And I want to ask my colleagues here, Mr. Speaker, on a personal basis. Please, don't fall for this sham. Don't send me out of here having failed to help those people. The gentleman's time has expired. The previous question is... Without objection, the previous question is... ♪♪ Barney always knew why he was here. And he was here for people. What is the existential? "Why am I here?" Why is he here? There is no doubt as to why Barney is here. While he was pragmatic in trying to forge solutions, he was always idealistic as to who should have the leverage at the end of the day. And the leverage should be with the people. And some people who needed-- painfully needed help always had a friend in Barney. And, Jim, in your photographs outside there's a really personal side about the congressman that's shown through those photos. And I wonder if that was your intention or if that's just us getting to see the congressman through your lens. I guess it could be somewhat intended because I had heard that before in, like, the picture with the fawn. Well, I just-- people like, "Aww." Like, he'd be yelling at it and the thing should be running away, you know? After all the turmoil in my own private life, and-- you know, I was just thinking, and I, obviously, the issues with being gay were very disruptive in my life. I was just reminded, reading the book review in the "Chronicle" today, of Alan Turing, who invented computers. Who helped win World War II by cracking the German code. He's an extraordinary, important guy. And then in 1950 or '51, they discover that he's gay and tell him he either goes to prison or takes estrogen so he is chemically castrating himself. And he dies, probably of suicide, within a few years. Well, that's-- that's when I was 14. I mean, so for me... there's been a kind of disparity between a very satisfying public career and a private life in turmoil. And, uh, that was one thing I always could envy of Charlie. He was married. In a way, I was-- I really wanted that. It's not something you can just order off the shelf. Eight days overdue. She had a baby in two hours. Start to finish. Right, I'm nine months and two weeks. Yeah. She just... It's been a wonderful, supportive marriage. And, uh, that's what's-- kind of I've caught up to him, I feel, with Jim. The fact that I'm now... in that situation, uh... It-- it's-- kind of completes it for me. This part here, the information you put on this we put it on, um, your marriage license. Again, I need your full name-- first, middle, last, each name spelled out. We'll do it together. All right. "I have reviewed a list "of impediments to marry and hereby state "that there is an absence of any legal impediment to this marriage and do hereby..." Okay. Yay! I'm amazed at how much-- how big they are so soon. That's great. They're usually behind, and I-- I end up pullin' a ton of ferns out so they don't choke up the bleeding hearts. You'll see in August that it's like... You can't even see in there. It's pretty cool. I think he's gonna be able to have a personal life that's gonna be very rewarding to him, and I guess that-- that feels very good to me. I think what he's done is-- for the country and in particular for gay people is enormous. He wasn't free to live his life and now he is. Yes. Yes. Ann and I will sit here. Over here. All right, go right ahead. It feels odd without music, though. Gotta restrain myself. This is only a practice. "I'm only sitting here doing a crossword puzzle." I bet, he's so like-- He's so relaxed, he's been smiling all day. He had the crossword puzzle or the paper. Yeah. Whew! ♪♪ Beloved family and friends, we have come together to witness and bless the joining together of Barney and Jim in marriage. As you might imagine, at the request of the congressman, this service will be short and to the point. But there are certain formalities that even a senior member of the Congress must observe. The first is this question. I ask you both, that if either of you know any reason why you may not be united in marriage lawfully, you do now confess it. No. I have to hear it. No, sir. Barney and Jim, do you promise to love each other and be each other's best friend... in sickness and in health under the Democrats or the Republicans... ...whether the surf is up or the surf's flat... whether the slopes are powdery or icy... for better or for worse, on MSNBC or on Fox... ...for long as you both shall live? I do. By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I pronounce that they are married. Breathe. Okay. Breathe, baby. Thank you, Governor. Thanks for that. That was just about the most, to me, showed him at his very best when the governor said, uh, "I pronounce you married," and Barney grabbed Jim and-- and broke down. And I started crying, everybody around me started crying. And-- and we started applauding, and pretty soon everybody stood up, and it just was a crescendo and, uh... just not only for the personal, but for the political and for the role Barney had played. But I think it showed that there was a personal side to Barney that wanted attention, and it was getting it. You know, he was just beaming from start to finish. And, you know, you don't really see Barney beaming a lot. You don't see Barney in that level of happiness. He can be cranky. Uh, and I think that was my favorite Barney moment was that wedding, because it was such a big moment and-- and you just watch the whole thing and how-- how clearly moved he was and how historic it was to all of us who were there. It was a big moment. ♪♪ That was the year-- his third term, that was the year I was born. Wow. 1940. Will you miss anything, Barney, about this? Oh, of course, I'll miss the chance to fix public policy. I mean, that's-- I, uh, that's the-- 90 perc-- 95 percent or even 100 percent of the reason for doing this is the chance to affect public policy. And... I will miss this, um... Even in the minority, you have some impact. Yeah, that I regret. There are things that a civilized society needs that we can only do if we do them together. And we do them together, that's called government. The current right wing, tea party dominated Republican not only hasn't learned from the mistakes of the past, they are determined to repeat them. We will not let that happen. Thank you. I think if you reflect upon his years in public life, it gets back to some political risk to himself and the risk, certainly, of taking enormous amounts of personal abuse over the years, he stood for the truth-- his truth. And his truth was a larger truth that-- that many people held. He stood for people and fought for people who needed someone like Barney Frank to stand and fight for them. And there are too few people left like that in public life. Thank you. Thank you. You're a tremendous public servant. You'll be missed. Thank you. As I look back, I mean, I really am fascinated with democracy. It's been my life's work. It's a moral cause. I think democracy is the only legitimate way to govern. And so understanding how to make democracy work better, I guess, is what I want to spend the rest of my time doing. ♪ Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Was ist los mit dir mein Schatz? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Geht es immer nur bergab? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Geht nur das was du verstehst? ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ This is what you got to know ♪ ♪ Loved you though it didn't show ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ So so, du denkst es ist zu spaet ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Und du meinst, dass nichts mehr geht ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ Und die Sonne wandert schnell ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪ ♪ After all is said and done ♪ ♪ It was right for you to run ♪ ♪ Ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht ♪ ♪ Uh-huh ♪♪
