(murmur of the sea) (murmur of the sea) - (children) Laia! Laia! - They're here! Those of Santa Tecla! Come on, hey guys! Take out the horns! We already have them here. - (boy 2) You'll see! - (boy 1) Aaah! Come on, we're all here! (shouting) Xumaco, leave me alone! (boy) Esteve, Quelot, come on! Aaah! Eat sand! Give it a go! In gift! I give it to you! Eat sand, Xumaco! To eat sand! Santa Tecla! There is nothing to do! We have won! We've won! Go home! Go away! (all) Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! We had a great time! Laia! Laia's luck? (Echoes) "You ate sand today!" Laia, who is already ill. How drooling! His tongue comes out like a mockery ... He looks like a snake. It is possessed by the devil. That's why it's so bad. He punched me yesterday! He pulled my hair out. And he spat at me. Snake! Snake! (all) Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Damn it! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Damn it! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Serpent, damn it! Snake! Snake! Enough, leave it, which is unfortunate! (your) Anem. (Tus) - (whistle) - (boy) Hairy! Come on, come on! (man) Time was time, say the old men, that here on the edge of the village of Sinera, where the sky joins the sea ..., there was a mysterious island, a floating island. On this island they said that some fish lived there ... "It's soaking wet again." "That's her mother." "She's a savage." What a house ... -Have you seen him? All naked.-Downloaded ... I didn’t, often. -Pearl! - "Pearl", he says ... If only he could be his father! (kids) Mail, mail! Grr! Grr! (boy) Aaah! Is that you, Laia? Is you? You're back! What do you think they don't know, what do you do? Do you think that there are no men who ...? You are bad and corseted. No man will ever want you. You are scared and miserable! No one will ever want you. No one ever ... Pull, pull. So what do you say? What do we all have to do? Watch out, man, we're downstairs! You're very distracted today, eh. It's a woman's fault. Oh, I get it, yes. I have Anneta in my head day and night. It would be better if you had her in bed. -This, until we get married ...- (laughs) Her father says we will have to wait a year. The two. They will make me long. You complicate your life too much. I don't plan to get married. And you better get it out of your head. Didn't you see yourself in the mirror? Laia is not for you. And you know what they say in the village: whoever approaches it will have nothing but misfortunes. Get to work, you bastards! Didn't Chelot tell you anything yet? Mhm-mm. Anton says a lot about you. And there is no shortage of suitors ... Oh, come on! They are already downloading. Good fishing today! Today the sea was a pool of oil, eh, Dad? I already told you. The sea should always be kept that way. Anneta ... look! -What a good pint.-Yes, eh! Remember to bring pagells to the godmother. And a prayer for me ... if you have one. The most beautiful, for you. - (rattlesnakes: dringuen) - (man) Come on! What do you want? Go ... say. What do you want? Do you believe in spells? (Man) Why do you say that? It's Laia. When we were little, I was scared and hated it, and now I can't get it out of my head. I just think about his eyes, that they look at me the way they look at me. And have you lost your appetite? And you always want to see it, and always have it close. Yes. And you're upset if you don't see her, you don't feel like doing anything. I don't eat, I don't work, I can't sleep. Well, you can only do one thing ... Which one? Marry her. What if he doesn't love me? Get married and may God bless you. Isn't she there, Laia? What do you want? I brought it to you ... I brought this to you. Oh ... a scorpion. I went to talk to the priest. And now I know, what I want. I want to marry Laia. (River) It's tasty, but you have to be careful. Because everything is thorns. Go where you came from and don't go near it! No! I want to get married. (laughs) You won't know what to do when you have her at home. Laia doesn't love you. Laia doesn't love anyone! (Anneta) Doesn't Quelot give you flowers? Only fish. What time should it be? This is the third time you have asked this question. I wish it was night. Yesterday he took me down to the portal. We were both alone, in the dark. And without saying anything, he kissed me. Her lips were burning. This one is already there. Come on, help me fold it. What envy you make me. I don't know why. For all the kisses I will give you and all the things you can say to yourself under such white sheets! Oh, go (laughs) Ai! Oh! Alas, I'm sorry I was distracted. I take the fish to the godmother. Leave it, man, you'll get it dirty! Not much is missing. For All Saints. Do you know what you're doing? Marry the Quelot. A woman like you ... What do you mean, you know me? Woman ... And who do you think I should marry? I do not know... I mean, I don't know what you saw in that little animal. Aren't you friends? Yes, best friends. I'm leaving, it's late. Where were you? At Anneta's house, sewing the utensils. Has. What a mess. A wedding on the day of the dead. What does Quelot see in Laia? If she's half crazy. Everyone says so. You've known her forever. When she was little, she was attacked i aquethe tremors ... What the hell. She is the strangest girl in town. You can now mourn your friend. She marries to run away from her mother, who is even crazier. I don't care. If you want to go inside ... and get wet ... No, you don't have to, that's fine. Goodbye, godmother. Goodbye, goodbye. (thunder) (bell: ringing) How white. Looks like they sucked his blood. Too bad clothes for such an ugly day. -It will tarnish it all.-And so much. Yes, I want to. And you, Laia, do you want to receive Quelot, present here, as a legitimate husband according to the rite of the Holy Mother Church? Yes, I want to. Shake hands. God marries you in marriage, "in nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti", amen. The rings. "Quod etiam est signum fidelitatis". "Oremus". "Benignus Dominus, assiste omnibus tuus ... quibus reproductione humani generis ordenasti ". "Per Christum, Dominum nostrum" .- (all) Amen. You are already married. - (laughs) -Long live! Long live the bride and groom! Get Paulina to dance, man. Don't look at her so much, I'll be jealous. I don't look at her. (Anneta) She's pretty in this dress, isn't she? Well, when you see mine, you'll fall off your ass. -Come on, go .- (man) Long live the bride and groom! Come on, get her dancing! I don't feel like it. And if not, with whom will you dance, poor thing? - (man) Long live the bride and groom! - (shouts of joy) Quelot, garrepa! Do you want to kill us with thirst or what? Bring more wine, woman, go! But what do you do ?! I had never seen you as beautiful as I am today. But what do you say? And you smell so good! You drank too much, Esteve. I'll tell Quelot! No, you won't tell him anything. Leave it, but what do you do? You're ... drunk! Quelot will not make you happy. You should have married me. Come on ... Good night, and good morning! Well that's it. We go? Didn't you hear me ?! Good night! Don't get too tired! It's raining again. What do you have What are you looking for? What are you looking for, huh? Aaah! Aaah! Don't shout so much. Aaah! Aaah ...! With the appetite you bring, when you marry Anneta, see if you can get a tie. Don't be an animal now. Early marriage times are the best. Night and day, like rabbits. But look, now with the pregnant woman, it's Quelot, who's hungry, right? What is this for Laia, for the boy to be born? And if she's a girl, what? Another fisherman in the family. I hope not. I don't want it for him, this life. What's wrong with the sea, and what's good? Going cold and hungry, jellyfish bites ..., cuts on the hands and "saltpeter" on the lungs. Being poor all your life, until a wave or a pneumonia ... take you to theanother world. It will be better for him to study with the chaplains. We will fish a little today. (kids) At 5, now I have you. At 6, smooth, smooth. At 7 o'clock Miquelet comes with his hands in his pockets, Long live Captain Tomaca! At 8, a good biscuit. At 9, a bull cut. And the Frigate? That's all right? Auntie looks less and less. If not, she would sew it, Sant Roc's skirt. "Good luck to you, Paulina." Poor thing, she has stayed to dress saints. Not like others ... Oh, Anneta? -When will the wedding be? -When my father says. Watch her eyes shine, damn it. Anton is a good boy. Strong as an oak, handsome ... and well considered. "You're dying, aren't you?" So don't get too excited. It's easy for you to tell. For Sant Jaume you will already have a child. Reach and grind. Quelot, married, and soon Anton. And what about Esteve? Won't that make you think? He always says he will never get married. But you know ... But are you dating someone? (laughs) Oh, yes? Which is? -Which ones? -Laia, what do you have? You are pale. Notify the midwife. -Go, Laia! -This, breathe ... -A little more! -Come on, go, push! Va! Push, Laia! A little more, Laia, a little more. -Go, you already have it.-Go, come on! Now, come on, fort! Aaaah! Push, Laia! Month! More! Aaah! More! Iaaah! (baby: crying) (cries) What happened? Laia! Laia ... For a moment I was afraid that ... What is this? What is this? (baby: somica) (baby: crying) Paulina says she was born with a spinal cord injury. -It's a punishment from God.-Poor Quelot. I was so eager to ... Another. Didn't you hear me ?! Escape, Ventura. Another. (baby: crying) And the worst part is that Ventura laughs at our beards! How do you want him to always win without a hitch? -Goodbye, Quimet.-Goodbye! -Good night, Quimet! Oh, you, you, the thought. Get up, it's time. Don't make noise. He fell asleep ... They were right. What? Your mother, the whole town ..., everyone was saying: "This woman will only bring you misfortune." You're drunk. You don't know what to say ... I wanted a son ... and you gave birth to a monster! Shut up! You'll wake him up! Damn the day that ...! Don't touch me! Shut up, snake! (Baby: cry) Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake (baby: crying) Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! # Grandparents and parents watch over ... # your long sleep ... # And the Quelot? How ... how is the creature? He's doing it (stammers) And these blues? Once, with the door. That doesn't close well and Quelot doesn't do anything to fix it. Any night while he's at the tavern ... someone will come into my house. What day is it? # No-no, no-no ... # Calm. We won't go deep today. # No-no, no-no. # Grandparents and parents watch over ... Oh, it's been a while since we've been out. Do you want to go? Vinc, vinc. # ... your long sleep. # And even the old five trees # of the enclosed garden. # And that smell, so white, # of jasmine. # Apa, Quelot! I'll tell Anneta to act like your wife. Lately he comes every day to say goodbye to you, eh! Boy, what the fuck? You're well-knit! Like rogerons in ox fishing, eh, Quelot? Get to work, you bastards! Go, up, up! Pound, pound, go! Up! Up! (Frigate) My father, Captain Villalta, knew Chopin. Once he came from Mallorca to visit him with Mrs. Dudevant. Sand talked a lot. Chopin, on the other hand ... kept quiet and coughed. On the afternoon of the arrival, the captain took her to La Pietat. Chopin went to bed to recover from the fatigue of the journey. But in the evening he got up and sat down at the piano, this Pleyel. His hands gently touched the keys and they struggled to get the work out in gestation. Chopin suffered. Yes, he suffered. And when I tried to translate the inspiration ..., it often failed and then started again until it ran out. (laughs) Later in the evening those present believed, in view of the ease of execution, who improvised ..., but I know of all his effort. And no one has played the piano since. Aunt Esteve has brought the fish. Oh, great. Let it happen. Do you want a cup of chocolate? No, another day, godmother. I have to "patch". If you don't handle anything else ... No, no, thank you, you can go now. Goodbye, godmother. Goodbye, goodbye. His grandfather was a faithful servant who risked his life for his father's world. Yes, yes, I know. It's heavy, always with the same stories ... Just wait. Do you want to leave now? What do you have, what do you do with this face? You're like foggy. It's tired. I'm wrong. You make a strange, scary pose. You see visions. Goodbye. You don't come to see me anymore. Leave me. Hide something from me. That's it, you bastards! (door: slam shut) If I weren't ... me. I present the tariffs. The ace of glasses ... and the 6 of sticks. And now that I get, for example, a pony. Or the "lea" of gold, it doesn't matter. No, the bearded swordsman. 7 and a half. Wafer! Boy, you cleaned me up. You put me between the parts and the wall. Let me tell you by ear. Want to know what superstition is, say? -Lucky.-Yes, lucky, lucky ... Hungry, it's! I'm leaving, and she's waiting for me. -No, no, not now, look at you! -What are you afraid of having to loosen? You can't move until it gets dark or else you're a pig. (unintelligible whisper) -It's well roasted.-At least it carries a load of mam. Esteve, what? No, no, I ... I guillo. Good night. Goodbye. Bye. This is the last, last and also photo field. Where is your friend today? Esteve. I don't know. I've been told he's having a party. While you're celebrating with a bachelorette party, right? Single and married! Esteve is a danger. -You, shut up, son.-All husbands are cuckolds. Endalet, what do you know about marriage, eh? I know what they tell me and I know what I see: all husbands are cuckolds, and all conform. The woman does not deceive me! Everyone believes it. Otherwise, no one would marry. Come on ... let's finish the game, come on. -Mine.-You've won again. And you, don't you eat? I've already eaten. (boy: crying) (boy: cries louder) (boy: keep crying) Even Anton's father says he heard it in the tavern. Little work, they have. (laughs) Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. How should you fool the Quelot? Do not marry before God to deceive your husband. I will never deceive you, Anton. Neither does he, of course. You can't know that. And as far as I know. Anton is not one of those men, Laia. He says that since we got engaged, he hasn't noticed any other girls. We will be so happy when we get married! All brides think about it. And most are wrong. No, I'm not. I'm sure, absolutely sure, yes. Door.But what do you have? Yes you are loaded. Let me help you. Thanks you're welcome. What about the tavern? Who are you with me? I don't think I'll be home alone. I'll help you. No, why? What can't Anton do? Yes, of course. This creature weighs more every day. I'm coming. Thanks you're welcome. But what do you do? Don't stay here, man. Pass. No, it's better to leave. You know how people are. Let it be, people. Oh, come on, you're going to have a glass of wine. Somehow I have to thank you. I leave this to you here. No, you don't have to, eh. I think so. (boy: stammers) Very good. If you want nothing more ... No, I'm leaving. What do you have with Anton? Don't be a donkey. Do you mind? Why did you take him home with you? How jealous and what children you are, men! I'm not like Quelot! You won't laugh at me! (Anton) Esteve! Va, help me! Zig Zag. Garbí! Get up! Garbí! -Garbí, garbí! Get up! Get up! Laia, that's enough. Go home! Go home, go! -Come, go, accompany.-To the east, go. Garbí! Get up! Go, go, go, go! Good thing my dad gave us permission. And well, get married in the spring, eh. I wouldn't want my wedding to be like Laia's. For me the rain was already announcing it. They are not happy. "Aren't you sorry?" "Oh, Anton, you're starting to make me suffer." Because? The role you played before the priest ... And now look how you are. Don't listen to me, I'm sure you don't even know what I was talking about ... "You were talking about Laia, about Laia." "Besides, you're drowsy." And you haven't brought me flowers in days. Why don't you want to get married anymore? But why do you tell me that? Why don't you stop punching me ?! -If this has to continue like this ...- Anton ... Of course I want to get married! Of course I want to get married! But if you ask me again, we will still end badly. You are a demon. You bewitched me ... (door: knock) Just wait. (door: knock) What do you want? I need to talk to you. Of what? No-don't you let me in? I'm starting to get used to it, from the chatter of the people. The other day you said you didn't care, the chatter. Tell me what you have to say. I can't marry Anneta. But what do you say? You got me in the head, Laia. No-I don't know what's wrong with me. No-I can't think of anyone else. Anton, don't be blessed. Why do you always look at me that way? Eh? It's your fault. What did you do to me? I didn't do anything to you! Why don't you go see Anneta? Anneta can't save me. But what are you doing, Anton! Let me go! Anneta can't save me. But what do you do ?! Get out of here! Get out of here. March! Get out of here! March! What did he want? Nothing. I was looking for the Quelot. What are you doing here alone, son? Anneta is worried, and so am I. Now shut up all day ... Is there anything that scares you? No, Dad. Don't fool me. I saw how you looked at her. Get it out of your head. Laia will only make you suffer. Look at Quelot's bastard all day in the tavern. Don't think about it anymore ... and make peace with Anneta. - (bell: ringing the dead) - (man) What happened? My son! You ..., it's your fault my son was killed! What...? You, why? Why, Laia? He has bewitched her! She's in love with him! You're bad, worse than the devil! What did you do to him ?! What did you do to him ?! We don't have to see each other again. Laia! Eh ?! Laia! - (boy) Look, what a face! - (girl) Who is this? - (boy 1) Look at him! - (boy 2) What clothes! - (girl 1) And what a stench it makes! - (girl 2) It stinks! Shoot the field! What a disgust! - (boys: laugh) - (girl) He's crazy. - (girl) What clothes, ecs! - (children: keep laughing) On the Day of Judgment will speak who will not have done good service! Jesus Christ, universal king ..., man and see eternal God ..., from heaven he will come to judge, and to each he will give justly. Before the Judgment, the Antichrist will come and make the whole world sad! Children of the devil! (girl) Is he dead? Sileta, the coins, grab the coins! "Well, what a stench!" Get out of here! Leave this bastard! Sileta, I'll nail you to a chewing gum, eh. -Flee! Come on, run! - (children shout) (girl) Run! Blessed Virgin Mary ... The Plague... The Plague! The Plague! The Plague! (people: tus) Bo! I already told you I don't want to see you again. What do you want? I want to know about you. Go away, Esteve. I'm sick. And the Quelot in the tavern ... Little one ... I'm dying. He warns the priest. He is also ill. Arri! The carpenter who can't reach making boxes, and I, opening holes ... And everyone says to me, "Let's see if you'll eat it in the end ..." And I answer: "May God's will always be done." (Frigate) Not even the priest has come today ... Everyone is afraid to leave home. They say it's their fault. From whom? "From Laia. She brought the plague." (Frigate) "Bajanades." That is a punishment from the Lord ... for being so bad. "That's why no one went to the cemetery." "Not even her husband accompanied her." "She had to bury that deformed creature on her own." Poor Laia ... Alas, how tired I am ... Go to bed and sleep for a while. - (coughs) -I'm going to make her an herbal tea. Help! Help me! Please! Help me! Help! Help! Please! The Frigate is sick! - (door: they call loudly) -Laia! -Open! Laia! - (door: they call loudly) Open, please! Laia! (door: keep ringing) Laia, please help me! The Frigate is dying! Do you knock on my door now? Because only you can help me! You have passed the plague, nothing will happen to you. I'm afraid ... You mustn't want her to die alone. Please. Go. It's in his room. And you? I'm going to look for the priest. Laia! Laia, it's me! She died alone ... she died alone! Wait, wait, wait, wait ... Close your eyes. (Monsignor) "With this plague, this terrible epidemic of cholera ... that so many souls of Sinera have been taken away, the Lord tests us. " "So we have to be strong, but we also have to be conscientious." Pray that He will forgive our sins and be worthy of His Divine Mercy. Page 46. We pray. "Free me, Domine, from eternal death, in the tremendous island, quando coeli movendi sunt et terra ". (woman 1) Give it to me ... That she didn't fall ill? I thought that ... (woman 2) Not even the plague could be taken away ... This is a hard carcass. "Requiem eternam dona eis, Domine ..." (tothom) "... et lux perpetua luceat eis". "Oremus". I can swallow his rejection. I don't care if they leave me alone. I don't need them for anything. But I do not forgive them that none, none, have given me condolences for my son. You ..., you're the only one who gives me some peace. If it weren't for you ... I wish one day I could leave Sinera and never go back ... But I wish Chelot wasn't there. Without him everything would be different. What are you saying? If something happened to Quelot ... Esteve ..., you and I could ... Did you go crazy or what? (Phenoses) It's been too long, this time of the devil. That way we can't go fishing. First the plague and now that. Hosti, what a punishment! If we want to go out to sea, we can only do one thing. "I wouldn't go out." The water will take you all. Let Fenoses talk, you bastards! We need to ask for help from heaven. Easter is approaching and, this year, the procession ... we should pray to St. Roch to bring us good weather. (Drunk) I'm wearing it. You can't. Leave it to me, you sucked well. I tell you I didn't drink! Oh, well, if you're well roasted! Collons! I'll take it! What are you arguing about? I have to carry the cross, like every year. Right law, it's up to me. He drank, he can't take it. Well, I have to take it myself! The reason is mine. If you can ..., bring it. # Those of Zion, the saint wept with sorrow, # sighing in pain ... Look, in Miquelot. - # ... to the step of the savior.-Alas, that is poured to him! (laughs) # Those of Zion, the saint wept with sorrow ..., # moaning in pain at the savior's step. (Fenoses) Let it be, Quelot. You will get hurt. Everyone is mad at me. What is my fault? (Fenoses) You are not to blame for anything. She's your wife. What do you say? The door to your home is always open. Your friend Esteve knows this better than I do. No! (big laughs: echo) Eh! (shouts) (blows) Since when do you cheat on me ?! Say! (Blows) Since when do you cheat on me with Esteve ?! Snake! Damn! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake (shouts) I can't take it anymore ... I can't take it anymore. I can't live with him, I can't stand him. I shouldn't have gotten married. You told me ... and you were right. I wish one day he would drown. I wish I could go fishing one day and not go home. We should not hide. You were ... We could go far ... you and me, both of us. (Endalet) Quimet, have you baptized the brandy, now, too? (men: laugh) New mom: fine that cut. Make me a better measure. It will scald you. (man) The bearded sword, 7 and a half. I shit on God and the devil! - Wafer! Where did you hide the letters? - Let me be! - "I don't cheat." - You hid it in your sleeve! Lifelong cheating! Enough. Enough! Son of a bad mother! No! Enough, enough! No, enough! (man) Stop it, you bastards! Stop it, you'll kill him! You killed him, Quelot. It's all your fault. Why don't you come see me again? Don't you want to know anything about me? Leave me. Now I have money! But if you don't love me, what good is inheritance? Let me go! (Cries) Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! -Don't go out.-It's good now, the wind has stopped. -Now yes, but then it will change.-Well we have to work. -You're getting old.-That's why I know what I'm saying. Quim, don't go fishing. Dad, it's been too long since we've spent the day in the tavern. (bell rings) I already told you that time would change. If only these children of mine had believed me! Listen to me, Saint Roc ... I haven't had a good life. I was so small when I got sick that I don't even remember it. With a mother who treats me like an animal ..., humiliated by the other children, who laughed at me, they called me "snake" ... and they hurt me. Mockery and injustice hurt me, it wasn't my fault. I had a son ... and he died. The Lord has done nothing but test me and make me suffer. Now I'm cheating on my husband. But it is not enough compensation for so much mistreatment, so much suffering. I want a full repair, you owe it to me. You know what it is ... and I come to remind you. Let the Quelot not return home. Don't come back from the sea. "I will change, Saint Roc." I will change, I will pray to you every day of my life, but let him not return, let him not return, let him not return. Let him not return home, let the sea swallow him. And if you swallow them both, better. (bell rings) (women: somiquen) And Quelot's boat? And Quelot's boat? (woman) It's the last boat left to arrive. And Esteve? And Esteve? And Esteve? A sea blow has taken him away. I tried to save him, but ... but I couldn't. The sea has swallowed it. You got hurt. I cut myself. Help me, let's go home. Laia! Didn't you hear me? Help me. (boy) How fat, Captain. Look how these two fight! Ah! How they sting! And there are wings ... And who are you? I'm Laia. Are you playing with ants? Come on in, take a look and enjoy yourself! Where? In the hermitage of Sant Roc, to see the devil's dog. What's going on? What are you afraid of? Eh, where are you going? Get out of here! Here I am in charge. Who says that, I'm the captain! Fuck the field here or I'll stamp you against the rocks! Try it! Try it, if you're brave. You try it! I'll blow your head off! I'm not afraid of you! What, are you coming? Or are you shit too? Shit? Come on, Esteve, come on. Don't think that you can run away. # No-no, no-no, no-no, # grandparents and parents watch your long sleep. # And even the old five trees in the enclosed garden. # And that smell, so white, of jasmine. # Slow dripping of laundry water. # Starlight calms the sorrows of the sky. # Looking for a fixed clock on a wall, # mark the passage of lines of stillness. # With outstretched hands they rub fingers of rials, # when the dawn horse bathes in the sea. # No-no, no-no, no-no, # grandparents and parents watch your long sleep. #
