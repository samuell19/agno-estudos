MAN: This is a hard land. About as hard as land comes. This is a land that's broken more men than it's made. Women, too, as far as that goes. But Mike, she was no ordinary woman. She was a wonder. She was a fine-blooded, spirited woman that had as much sand in her as any man that ever rode this desert or these hills. Why, she didn't even have a man when she first took root amongst us 20 years ago or more. But she set to it. She built and she prospered. And now the good Lord has seen fit to take her away from us. Yes, he reached down and touched her with the fever. Ain't fair. Ain't fair, some of you are saying to yourselves. Mike having to leave her loved ones like this. Beth there. Matthew. But remember, the Lord only done it so He could take her home to Himself, and it ain't for us to figure out the mysteries of His holy ways. And that's about all I've got to say on this subject, so, if you fellas would like to lower the coffin into the ground. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The way of all flesh. Praise be His holy name. Amen. ALL: Amen. Amen. DILLON: Thank you, Zack. That was well spoken. I appreciate it, Matt. Beth, I'll see to the folks. We're all going to miss her, child, but what's done is done. We've got to get on with other things. You've got to get that education that your mama was always so proud of talking about. Now, you've still got your daddy. You cleave to him and, well, time will take care of the rest. Matt, I just want to tell you again how sorry I am about this. Losing family like that is the hardest, I know. Thank you, Charlie. Well, I guess me and the boys better get back to work. You carried her good, Buck. I wish we could've all spent more time together, Beth. You know, Beth, it's all right to cry. She never cried. She was a strong woman. I'm just glad I was here at the end. Thank you. The train is delayed. They had a breakdown in Tucson. It's going to be a while. I was hoping it wouldn't arrive at all. Now, Beth, we've been over that a lot of times this last three weeks. I guess so. As long as we're stuck here, what do you say we go get something to eat? I think that's an excellent idea. Come on. I just don't understand why you won't let me stay here and take care of you. Beth, you've got to finish school first, then you come back. We'll have a lot of time to spend together. Look, this is what you're mother wanted more than anything. Well, she wanted that when she thought she'd still be here. Now I think she'd say different. Beth, this is how it's gotta be. You are the stubbornest human being I've ever known. Now that's funny. That's what your mother used to say about you. (Talking, laughing loudly) Mister, where I come from, a man'll get killed scaring another man damn near half to death like that. Now, git. (Men laughing) (Gunshot) You buy that man a drink. I ain't buying nobody nothing. I'm thirsty! (all talking at once) (Men talking, laughing) What have we got here, huh? Attaboy, Tommy. Go get her. Well, hello, sweet thing. Well, if you ain't about as half pretty, huh? (Men smacking lips) (laughing) You're in my way, mister. Yeah, I'm trying to talk to this sweet little lady here. Yeah, well, you talked... Now move. Dad. "Daddy"? (Men laughing) Well... well, Daddy, I may just decide (laughs ): to steal this little lady back home with me. Well, I'd move if I was you. MAN: Whoa... (glass breaking) (Cocks gun) He's not worth dying for. DILLON: Forget it, boy. I ain't no boy. DILLON: Now, mister, my daughter's waiting for an apology. I'm not a patient man. I, uh... (panting) I, uh, would like to... apologize... ma'am. MAN 2: Hello, Matt. You, uh... you got some trouble here, do you? No, not anymore, Tom. Young fella here just needed a little brush up on his manners. School's out. (Chuckles ): Yeah, so I see. Well, I'll take it from here. Much obliged. Them your ponies outside, boys? MAN: Yeah, they're ours. And they ain't stole, if that's what you're hinting at. Oh, I ain't hinting, I'm telling you. Get outside, get on those ponies, and get out of here. You got no right, no more than that old man had any right. Son, the name of that old man is Matt Dillon... and you're all damn lucky you ain't laid out in pine boxes. Now git. The man represents the law, boys. Do like he says... git. Tommy Graham ain't gonna take that lyin' down. (Cattle mooing) Throw a bigger loop, Will. I said bigger. Cowboying ain't algebra, Will. You learn it like anything else if you put your mind to it. You know, you come out here with all that Eastern college know-how, but books ain't exactly the same as the doing and doing is putting this rope around that steer. Hell, any ten-year-old can rope a steer. Well, maybe I'm too old to learn. No. It's easy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Yeah, there he is all right. Which one? GRAHAM: The oldest one. You sure got a big burr under your saddle, Tommy. I mean, coming this far after one fella. That just ain't one fella, Texas. That's a Tewksbury. What are you fixin' to do? Making Charlie Tewksbury a sorry man. Hyah. GRAHAM: Come on. Company, Charlie. Charlie? (Cattle mooing) GRAHAM: Should've kept running, Charlie. Hey, what do you want? Shut up! Wasn't running, Tommy. I just got sick of all the killing. Killing ain't over... not yet. (cocks gun hammer) I ain't armed. Wouldn't matter if you was. (Grunts) Hyah. Hyah. Hyah. Rusty! Rusty, shoot him! (Gunshot) (Grunts) What's wrong with you?! (Clicks tongue) Hyah. Hey, Tommy. You didn't say nothing about shooting him down. That there is just cold-blood. That's just the way he would've done me the other way around. I told you when I hired you on, it was a blood feud. There ain't no such thing as rules. All right, Billy, let's bunch out them cattle and get home. Hell, it ain't much, Tommy. Maybe about a hundred head. Well, every little bit helps, don't it? Get to work. First you kill a man, and then you steal his cows? Let's just get out of here. Hey, you hold on. Them ain't Tewksbury cattle out there. Those are Matt Dillon's. I figure Dillon owes me a little something. I didn't count on none of this. Well, you make up your mind, Tex-ass. You coming or going? Hyah! Hyah! (Clicks tongue ): Come on now. Come on now. Hyah. Hyah. (whistles) Whooya. Whooya. Come on. (Clicks tongue, whistles) Come on now. Come on now. Hyah! Get on up there. Get on up there. Get on up there. (Whistle blowing) Wake up, folks, train's here. Looks like it's coming. (Whistle blowing) Mr. Dillon. Will? Rustlers, Mr. Dillon. They shot Charlie and Jesse. They're dead. And they run off maybe a hundred head. Well, who were they? Charlie... he knew 'em. He called one of 'em Tommy. One of 'em was just a kid. He was riding an Appaloosa. What are you going to do? Beth, you've got to get on the train. No. Will, would you put your saddle on a buggy horse? Yes, sir. Good-bye, Beth. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Beth, you've gotta get on the train. You're going after them, aren't you? Look, where I'm going doesn't matter. You've gotta get to Philadelphia. I shouldn't go away at a time like this. I should be here with you. Beth, I'll be here when you get back. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Please, get on the train. (Squeaking) Will, where'd this happen? Sanchez Creek, just below the canyon. Mr. Dillon, I couldn't even get to a gun. Don't worry about that, Will. We didn't hire you to get yourself killed. Look, uh... find the sheriff, will you? Tell him what happened. Yes, sir. You all right? I just got a knock in the head. I'm okay. Maybe get it checked out. I will. (Snoring) (Whistle blowing) (Bell ringing) (Horses whinnying) Hello? Anybody here? (Snoring) Hey, mister. Who in the hell are you? Mister, how much for this big mare here? She ain't for sale. No time to haggle, mister. How much? Lady, are you crazy? You can't buy that horse. You can't buy any of these horses, 'cause I ain't selling horses. Why not? Why? I don't know. Well, because it-it ain't business hours, that's why. She's probably not worth $50, but I'll give you $75. Seventy-five? Cash. How 'bout a saddle? Lady, I ain't a mercantile. Fine. I'll get by. (Horse whinnies) Charlie. (Cattle lowing) Beth? Oh, Beth, you aren't supposed to be here. Where's my father? He went after the rustlers. Then the sheriff and a couple of deputies took off after him. How far after Matt were they? A good day... northwest, near as I can tell. How's your head? Oh, well, it's, uh... I was just a little woozy at first. A little pain now and then. Oh, Will, take care of that horse for me. (Horse snorting) (Horse whinnies) (Men shouting) I ain't no rustler! You're just a gang of damned murderers! All we need is a strong tree and a sturdy rope. No. Trail to Cherry Creek. I want folks to see. Let's go, men. (Whinnying) Who'd be out here? Don't want no witnesses coming back here on us. Take a look. (Snoring) Who are you? Give me that. We never stole a cow in our lives. We've decided different. You're gonna hang, decreed by the Committee of 50. Get on with it, boys. You're not gonna get away with this! We didn't do nothing! Get on over there. Who's that? Some damn drifter. My name is Dillon. Is that so? What do you think you're doing here? I figure him to be one of them grand cow thieves. I say we stretch him like the others. Vigilantes. Night riders. You don't know what you rode into here, mister. Tomorrow, you ride yourself out of this valley, forget everything you saw here. Let's hang him, too. No, forget about this one. (Grunts) Okay, boys, we got business here. Let's get on with it. Dear God, don't do this! What's gonna happen to our families? Well, ain't that just too bad? That's what they all say. You men are gonna be a lesson for the next rustlers that come this way. Now hang. Hyah! (Birds chirping) (Horse snorting) (Whinnying) (Wind whistling) Will, saddle Redwing for me and throw a pack saddle on the mule. Where are you going? After Matt. I've been thinking about Pleasant Valley and all the trouble up there Charlie Tewksbury told us about. Alone? No. No, no. I can't allow that. You don't have a say. I just visited my mom. I know what she would have done. She'd go. Well, if you're going, I'm going with you. Your dad would never forgive me if I let you go alone. Will. I'm going with you. It's gonna be a hard ride, Will. I just hope you can keep up. Pa? Ain't that a pretty sight? Whoa. Good day to you, sir. I'm looking for the nearest law. Well, that'd be Payson, that way a few hours. Who might you be? My name's Matt Dillon, and you're Colonel Tucker. We met before, Colonel, after the war at Dodge City. You were running longhorns up from Texas. You were the Federal Marshal. By God, I remember now. You saved my hide when that bunch of drunk Yankee soldiers jumped me. By damn, Dillon, ain't coincidence something? That there's my youngest son, Cole. Welcome to Pleasant Valley. I already been welcomed, Colonel. You know any of those men? Well, yes, sir. I think I recognize them. Troublemakers, all of them. That one there fancied hisself some kind of a gun hand. What happened? Vigilante party strung 'em up last night. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Colonel? No, sir, I wouldn't. Except there is some rumors. You see, we have us a unfortunate situation here in the valley. A feud been going on for six years now. Lots of killing. Between the Tewksburys and the Grahams. Been reading about it in the papers down south. Our problem is, these killings is acting like a magnet, drawing riffraff from everywhere. Got so a man can't leave his stock on the range one day and be sure he's in the business the next. Courts, the law, ain't up to the job, so rumor is a group of righteous folks got together, put an end to it. But that's a rumor, anyway. What happened last night was murder, Colonel. I'm going to report it that way. You do what you have to do, Matt. Of course, the message is going to get across anyway. You, uh, going fishing? Well, for a matter of fact, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Going fishing for land. Did you ever hear of the U.S. Swampland Act? The law allows such terrain as can be traversed only by boat can be claimed free and clear. Don't see any swamp. That's a technicality. Lord, I figure a couple of million years ago, there had to be a swamp right here. Be hard to prove, wouldn't it? Prove? Why, my boy Virgil found a petrified toad right up that canyon. Of course, let the government prove to the contrary. Matt, now I would ride careful because rumor is there's some more tidying up to be done here in Pleasant Valley. Let's go, boys. MAN: Hyah! Get up, hyah! This'll do. Plenty of water and grass. I'll see to the horses. You unpack, build a fire and start dinner. Me? Why don't I see to the horses and you unpack and start a fire and make dinner? In the first place, 'cause I want the horses tended to right, and in the second place, because you work for me. Hold it. Your mom hired me and now I work for your dad. Which I thought was a mistake at the time. Okay. Okay, I'll cook. But the first complaint I hear, you get the job. Ugh. That's worse than hog leavin's. Do I hear a complaint? It's very tasty hog leavin's. (Dog barking) (Barking continues) Lord almighty. Who are you? My name's Dillon. Yours? I'm, I'm Deputy Rudd. What happened? Where's the sheriff? He took a prisoner up to Contention City. He won't be back till later. When he gets back, you tell him I want to see him. These men were lynched. What am I supposed to do with them? Get them out of the sun, I guess. (Dog barks in distance) Hello, boys. Well, if it ain't old man Dillon. You're a long way from home, ain't you? I'm looking for the men that murdered Charlie Tewksbury and Jesse Turner, rode off with 100 head of my cattle. Cattle? What cattle? And killing? Don't know nothing about no killing. Ain't you the one that whooped Tommy? Boys, maybe you want to take this outside. Shut up, Cap. If I were you, Dillon, I'd head back down south. Spurs flying. You better ease off, boy. That's the whiskey talking. You don't want to have to back it. That must be some kind of warning. Advice. Your eyes bad, mister? There's three guns here. You're coming down with the dwindles. I'd leave, mister. When I do, I'll be driving 100 head of cattle. Your ears going, too? You know something, boy? You keep running with this pack, you're gonna wind up dead. Rudd, ain't you gonna arrest him or something? Rowe, that man rode into town trailing three corpses. He's just accounted for two more, and it ain't even noon yet. You arrest him. MAN: Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Whoa! Whoa, there! Hey, hey! Easy. Easy. Whoa. Thank you. Ma'am. Cloud, what the hell is this? A gunfight, Sheriff. Not a half an hour ago. A couple of Graham's boys took on a stranger. Stranger? Dillon's his name. I must say, since he rode in, the business climate has improved considerable. Good day, Sheriff. DILLON: Too much whiskey. Sooner or later, it leads to trouble. When are you going to stop trying to talk horse sense into mules? Cap, a bottle. Abel Rose. Matt Dillon. How long has it been? Sheriff, I can explain. I doubt it, Willy. Don't interrupt your elders. '71 wasn't it? You and I partnered up to bring in Cal Harper and his brothers. Matt? No, no thanks. (Gasps) You want to tell me what happened here? I lost 100 head of cattle to rustlers down near the Dragoons. Followed 'em up here. And you're sure they're the ones? Been after 'em for a week. Ain't shooting a might harsh for cattle stealing? They didn't give me much choice, Abel. He's lying. Now you listen to me, boy. You're gonna lead me to my cattle, and then you're gonna help me drive them back where they came from. Like hell I am. Now, I've been mightily inconvenienced by you and your friends. Now, you're going back to Tombstone, and you're gonna answer to the law for rustling and murder. I-I didn't kill nobody. Well, if you didn't, maybe you won't hang. What are you doing now? This ain't dignified. Neither is laying in the sawdust on a saloon floor. You got everything you need, Matt? Yeah. You sure you gonna be able to handle him? It's a long trail. He's a pup, but he's a Texan. I'll handle him. Question is: What are you gonna do about the lynchings? Well, I... I've gotta do some investigating into that right enough. Any idea who's responsible? Idea... maybe. Fact is, them three was... The law says something about a trial before a hanging. I know. Damn it, I know, Matt. Tucker? Yeah. The colonel had his own reasons. You see, his youngest boy was killed, he was bushwhacked. Well, the colonel, he blamed it on the riffraff and that is the beginning. Doesn't excuse a lynching. Tucker and a lot of the rest of them, they stood my bond. I guess you could say they got me elected, too. I go to sticking my nose in their business and I'm liable to get it bit clean off. I sure wouldn't want to be the man tried to bite off your nose when we rode together. Well, times change, Matt. You was right to get out of marshaling. Back in our day, a man could wear a badge and not feel like he's just another hired hand. Besides, you only had yourself to take care of. I had me a family. Come a rainy day, a man sometimes needs more than just a slicker. To hell with the rainy days, Abel. We're talking about the total of a man's life here. How much of himself he's willing to sell off. What's your name, boy? I said, what's your name? Rusty. Rusty Dover. All right, Rusty... let's go get my cows. You're a stubborn man, I give you that. I mean, I wouldn't have figured nobody'd trail us far as you did. Not for no hundred head. They're my hundred head and that's not to mention two men killed. Well, it ain't gonna do you no good 'cause Tommy Graham's gonna kill you. That's what he's gonna do. The feuding Grahams? That's right. And Tommy don't tolerate nothing from no man. I wouldn't count on that. He's already run into me one time before. You was just lucky. You're riding with a bad bunch there, boy. Why? They're my friends. They as good as family to me. Family is family. Your friends are nothing but a bunch of thieves and killers. You don't know nothing about it. No? (Yelling ): Yeah-ho! Yeah-ho-ho-ho! (Fiddle playing) (People yelling) Get out of the way now! Get out of the way! Yay-ho! (Fiddle plays) (Whooping) Somebody get me a drink here! Here you go, Colonel. Oh, thank you, son. Aha! It was May '27, Canterbury Hill... our backs to the sea, but I had 407 Texas volunteers behind me and a Tennessee stud horse under my ass. In the charge we made that morning, folks, likes of it'll never be seen again. Then how come ya'll took such a lickin', Pa? Lickin'? Lickin'? I'll show you, lickin'. Git up. (Hooting, hollering) Yee-haw! (Gunshot) (laughter) Them damn Yankees are getting meaner every year, ain't they, Pa? Come on, get up. It don't look like you broke nothing. Afternoon, Colonel. Yo, Matt! I didn't necessarily expect to see you again so soon. You still looking for them cows of yours? That's right, Colonel. Didn't realize this was your place. To get the cows back I may have to cross your land. Why, you go right ahead. Who you got there? He's a wrangler I picked up on the trail. He ain't gonna do much wrangling hog tied like that. We'll manage. We're just celebrating my birthday here. Why don't you climb down and join us? Pa... I seen that boy before. Riding with Tommy Graham. Glad to see you're cleaning up the litter around here, Matt. Of course you don't speak for the law no more, do you? Do you? My friends and me swore a solemn oath to put an end to that sort. Return the people to law and order. Your law, your order? You even got a name for it, haven't you? Committee of 50. All that means is somebody's got a taste for blood. Blood purifies. Says so in the Bible. Let me tell you, Colonel, you're not going to take this boy. That's the kind of trash killed my boy Georgie. That kind of vermin needs to be exterminated. I could insist. I wouldn't do that. No. Son, it's all right. Why, shoot, Matt, have it your way. I'm sure you're going to do what's right eventually. So long, Colonel. You just gonna let him ride out? It's all right, son. Nobody steals from us and ours without paying a price. Nobody ever has. That boy ain't gonna be the first. (Thunder cracks) There's a light up ahead. Come on. Wait a minute. You don't know who these people are. And with everything we've heard... Fine, you stay here and drown. Not me. (Clicks tongue) (Sighs) (Clicks tongue) Hello, inside! Will! MAN: Don't move an inch! Or the next one puts you under. Who are you? I'm Beth Dillon from down south. All right. Move in closer. Hold it there. Step on down. Let me have a look at you. Now, walk your horses on in, tie them up. All right. Come on in. Kirby, put these folk's horses in the barn, give them some feed and wipe down the saddles. Yes, sir. You can put your stuff up over there. Thanks. You folks look hungry. There's a pot of stew on, plenty for everyone. We sure could eat. Thank you. Sorry about putting that hole in your hat, but strangers this far up make us edgy. What are you doing up here? Rustlers hit our place a week ago. My father trailed them up this way. Alone? That's a fool thing to do. You don't know my father. Your Mr. McCall seems awfully nice. He's not my Mr. McCall. I just thought since you were traveling together. He's an easterner. My folks hired him. Now I seem to be stuck with him. You give him a chance. Maybe there could be worse things you could be stuck with. BETH: We sure do appreciate your hospitality. Afraid hospitality comes in second place out here. What's first? Staying alive. Rustlers? Grahams. Grahams? Tewksbury and the Grahams been feuding in this valley for longer than I care to think about. Then you must be a Tewksbury. I am. (Clears throat) Kin to Charlie Tewksbury? Charlie's my brother. He's working down by Tombstone now. You must know Charlie. Sir, I need to talk to you. Well, spit it out, boy, or you're gonna bust. Mr. Tewksbury, your brother's dead. How do you know? I was there. He was shot. Tommy Graham, wasn't it? John. I told Charlie not to leave. That it was safer for him here in his own place. But he was set on getting out. He just wanted to find some peace. There's no such thing as peace in Pleasant Valley. It's like living in a crossfire. Men dying on both sides. Last spring... they bushwhacked my little brother Frank up on the rim. Then they killed Pa... and now Charlie. They're gonna pay for it. (Baby cries) (Thunder rumbling) It's getting late, Beth. Will, I'm sorry I couldn't tell them. I just didn't know how. That's okay. Well, we'll be pulling out early, so I want you to saddle the horses... Beth, stop it. Now I've had a long day and a worse week and I'll be damned if I'm gonna take any more of your orders. Orders? Quiet. You listen to me. Now what needs to get done tomorrow is gonna get done, understand? Now, I understand about the pain of your mother's death, even if you refuse to show it... I do, and I wish there was something I could do, but I can't. Good night. Beth. Come in by the fire. Please? You don't handle yourself like no rancher. Came to it late. Well, it ain't no kind of life, I could tell you that. It's honest. Honest? That's what my daddy would have said. Hell, he's as honest as the day is long, and dirt poor. And you're an improvement on that, huh? I sure am. I got my pride. I stand up for those that stand up with me. The day he ran me off, he said I'd probably hang. Well, maybe I will, but I'll spit in the eye of the man that does it. Why'd your daddy run you off in the first place? None of your damn business, that's what that is. Now what? Rider. Came through here this morning since the storm. Well, ain't that an event. It wouldn't be, except this one here is riding a horse with a bar shoe. I should be doing that, Mr. Tewksbury. The least I could do for your hospitality. Your finding that girl's father is the important thing. (Gunshot) John! (Gunshot) We got 'em, Tommy! Will! That's for Jimmy and Clyde! Rot in hell, Tewksbury! John! (Groaning) Someone's stirring down there. Wait. (Rifle cocking) To the last man. Don't leave me, Will! Don't leave me! Will! (Gunshots) (Sobbing) (Baby crying) He's still alive, ma'am. He's still alive! Who is that fella? I don't know. Anyway, it don't really matter. Still gotta clean out the whole nest of 'em. (Baby crying) They're coming down. Go on, keep your head down. (Groaning) He ain't finished, Tommy. Hold it. (Yells) Oh, God. Well, ain't that the best sight ever... A Tewksbury crawling. Piece by piece, boys. Like slaughtering beef. (Cries out) Ma'am, get away from the window. (Gunshots) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it... Lizzie... (baby crying) Billy, take Roe with you and torch it. One way or the other, we'll clear 'em out. (Gunshots) (Gunshots) (Distant gunshots) Get down. Let's go. Hey. What are you doing? (Baby crying) Get in the bedroom and shut the door! Billy's going around the back. We got 'em pinned down. Let's take 'em! (Groans) On the hill! Up on the hill! Damn! Got us in a crossfire. (Gunfire stops) ♪ ♪ (horse whinnies) Will. We're okay. I need help! Tommy, Billy! Hey, it's me Rusty. Hell, he can't pull a trigger. He's no use to us. Hyah! Hyah! Shh. It's all right. (Door opens) Beth, what are you doing here? I came looking for you. Don't blame Will. Nobody could have done better when the trouble hit. Not even you. Beth, I found the cattle. I'm just going to get them started, then I'm going to catch up with you. Now, the important thing is for you and Will, to get this baby into Payson. I know. What if he gets sick? I wouldn't know what to do. Now, Beth, you'll do fine. I'll meet you in Payson. Sheriff's name in Payson is Abel Rose. Tell him what happened and who's responsible. Right. I'll catch up with you in a day or two. They were good people, sir. Shot down without a chance. Yeah, seems to be Graham's style. Will, I appreciate you standing by Beth the way you did. Did a real good job here. You can be proud of yourself. Thank you, sir. (Horse whinnies) About time. Figured you was killed or something. You worried, were you? Oh, sick to death with it. What happened up there? Your friends, they got away. I'm surprised they didn't stop and pick you up. I didn't see nobody. Yeah? Well, you must have dozed off because the tracks go right by here. So now what? So, I'm still short a hundred head. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Graham's place? You still gonna try and take Billy and the boys? That's right. They got you outgunned, mister. Weren't no cow ever dropped worth getting killed over. Tommy. Tommy! (Ice cracks) What do we do? Bury him. (Revolver cylinder clicking) Outside. Well, Dillon, you found your cows. Now all you got to do is take 'em. Dillon? Hey, Dillon, I'll fight with you. They've got you outgunned five to one. Just untie me. Let me have my gun. I said I stand with any man that stands with me. Now, you did and they didn't. You'd still have to go back to Tombstone. Hell, I'd just soon get shot up here as to get hung down there. All right. You know how to use it? You just watch me. All right, circle around behind the corral. We'll stampede 'em. When? You'll know when. (Chambers round) (Chambers round) That's far enough, Graham. What do you want, Dillon? My cattle... and you. I'm taking you in, the whole bunch of you. Billy, I am clean out of patience. Yah! Hyah! Hyah! (Gasping) (Screams) (Groaning) (Yells) RUSTY: Whoo-hoo! RUSTY: Get out of here! Move it, boys! Move it, cows! Hyah! Bup, bup, bup! Hyah! Get out of here! Whoo! That's enough, boy. I'll take the gun back now. You gonna tie me up again? Expect I'd have to kill you if I said yes to that, huh? Just remember what I told you. I ain't no boy. Yeah, I'll remember, Rusty. Are you the sheriff? No, he's over to the saloon. Well, you better get him. We've got some murders to report. Murders? More? Who should I say...? I'm Will McCall. That's Beth Dillon. And these folks are the Tewksburys. It happened yesterday. Ma'am, did he say you was a Dillon? Yes. Kin to Matt Dillon? Yes. How'd you know? Oh, just guessing. Well, you folks wait right here. I'll go get the sheriff. RUSTY: Yep, ho! Come on now. Pretty good hand, Rusty. Well, it was the front and back end of my education. You never told me why your folks ran you off of their place. Uh, it weren't my folks. It was my pa. My ma, she died and he remarried again. You know, some young little old thing. She weren't that much older than me. Don't get me wrong or nothing. I was something wild, all right. The fact is, she kind of liked that, you know? And when he found out how much she liked it... I never touched her, though, I swear. Even though she never missed her chance. I wouldn't have done that to him. But he thought I did and... Rusty, who killed Charlie Tewksbury? It was Tommy. I weren't never even a thief before that. I don't suppose you got any reason to believe that though. No... but maybe I do. You do? Thank you. You about ready to get them old damn mangy cows you're so fond of going again? Hey! Hey! Hyah now! Get on up there! Hyah! Can you believe that? There's Dillon with that cow thief. We best go tell the colonel. Come on. Howdy, Mr. Dillon. Deputy. My daughter show up here? Sure did. Her and her escort, too. Oh, well, he's bunking with me. She's over at Ms. Oliver's place, down at the end of the street on your right. You ever find them cows of yours? Yeah, they're just outside of town. Well, at least you ain't towing no dead bodies this time. No, this time, I buried 'em. Palmer Graham, Billy Wilson, Sam Grady. Any leftovers? There was a couple, but the way they were riding, they're probably halfway to Texas. How about that kid you rode out with... Dover? He's tending my herd. Kind of chancy, ain't he? Well, I don't think so. Young fella might turn out to be one to ride the river with. Sheriff. Clare. This here is Matt Dillon. Oh. Please, come in. I'd like to pay you something for your trouble, Mrs. Oliver. Oh, nonsense. Your daughter has more than earned her keep. She's a fine girl. Matt, I'll just wait for you downstairs. Beth, your father's come to get you. Matt, you're all right. Beth, how's the little fella? He's fine. He's got kinfolk in California. Mrs. Oliver's going to see he gets there. Beth did real good with him. Good. Beth, you know it's time we got started for home. All right. I didn't think it would be so hard to say good-bye. It's all right, child. You'll have your own baby soon enough. He's so tiny... so alone. Thanks to you, he'll never have to be alone again. It's not just the baby, is it? No. It's mom. (Cries ): I really miss her. So do I. So do I. Well, Matt, the trouble in this valley should be settled thanks to you. Things don't settle, Abel, they get settled. One of these days, somebody's gonna have to stand against Tucker. 20 years ago, it might've been me. You sure you ain't looking to pin a badge on again? I got my cows back. I got no more use for Pleasant Valley. So long, Abel. Is that him, Matt? Go easy on him, Beth. Uh, I'm mighty sorry about what happened at your place, ma'am. I didn't see it coming. My father says you're all right. I'm trying. Your father, he's quite a man. Yes, he is. All right, let's move 'em out. Hyah. Get on up there. Go. Ho! (Whistles) (Yelling at cattle) Go, get up there. Yo! Hyah! Get up there. Get up there, come on. (Whoops) Get up there. Hyah! Hey! Get up there. (Whistles) (Whoops) Whoo! Get up there. (Whoops) They sweet on each other? I don't know. Is that what it looks like to you? I'd at least say they working theyselves up to it. Does that feller suit you? Well, I don't know. I hadn't given that much thought. Well, he ain't that much of a cowboy. Which means he's got more sense than me or you. Rusty, you know, when we get back to Tombstone, I'm gonna put in a word for you. Your side of the story might be some help. I appreciate that. When you get straight with the law, if you're a mind, come by and see me. Might be we'd have a job for you at the ranch. (Cattle lowing) I'll take the first watch. Rusty, you nighthawk... Will. I'll relieve Rusty, just tell me when. Good. (Whistling) (Whistles) (Cow moos) (Clicks tongue) Get over there, little... get over. That's right. That's right. Move over a little bit. Attagirl. Easy now. (Branch cracks) Damn cows anyway. (Horse neighs) (Groans) We didn't forget you, boy. You're gonna hang for your thieving ways. Anything you want to say before you go? Yeah. Why are you hiding behind that damn hood? Who do you think you're fooling anyway? Suit you better now? Yeah. Then, swing! (Horse neighs) Oh, my, God. What happened? They lynched him. Will, can you get him down? Yes, sir. Who? Vigilantes. But he was just a boy. He stood some taller than that. Where are you going? Beth... you and Will take the herd, go on home. I know Rusty meant something to you, but... He was murdered, Beth. I understand why you had to go after our stock, but this isn't the same thing. Let's go home. I lost mom, I don't want to lose you. Please, don't go. I have to, Beth. I spent a lot of years wearing a badge because I believed in the law. I still do. But you're not the law anymore. I'm a man, Beth. Means I've gotta live with myself. It's all part of the same thing. You go home. I'll be along. Give him a good burial, Will. Here? What about his people? If he had any that counted, he'd still be alive. And, Will, the herd, push 'em hard. The sooner you're out of Pleasant Valley, the better. Right. I'll be back, Beth. I promise. (Clicks tongue) (Sighs) Morning, Matt. Abel. What brings you out this way? I heard some rumors in town that the Committee was gonna riot last night on your trail. Yeah, they did. The boy? Oh, hell. You're going after the colonel, ain't you? I am. I'll ride along. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Hey, Pa. (Cattle lowing) Never did tell me how you got into ranching. Maybe over a beer sometime. Be looking forward to it. Rose! I bought you with good money. I thought we had us a deal. Lord, boys, I do hate to see the investment go sour this way. The colonel. He's a talker. Step on out here. boys. We got us some visitors. Dillon, you're on my property. This time, you ain't welcome. This time, you're trespassing. We're here to take you and your boys in for murder. Murder? Well, what poor soul are we discussing here? Rusty Dover. He was just a boy, Tucker. That boy had bad habits, Dillon. Hanging's a sure cure. How do you want to take them? Straight on. I don't know. Pa? Yeah. Five of them. You got any preference? I'd prefer you didn't miss. And you? This here scatter gun, I gotta get close. (Rifles cocking) That's right, boys. Just keep on a-walkin'. (Groans) (Yells) (Yells) TUCKER: Don't retreat. Hold your ground. Hold your damned ground. (Groans) Reginald. Cole. Son. I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry, Virgil. I'm sorry, boy. You want to give it up, Colonel? You go straight to hell. I didn't give it up at Canterbury Hill. I didn't give it up at Shiloh. And I ain't going to give it up now. Can you get your arm up, Matt? Yeah. Take him. How you feeling? Like a lawman. What do you say we get out of here? (Cow moos) (Horse neighing) Beth.
