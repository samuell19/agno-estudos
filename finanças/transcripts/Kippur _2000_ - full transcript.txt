Grab him, Gadassi. I've got him. - One moment, Gadassi. - I won't move. Wait! Over there. Put him down a moment. Wake him up. You can't stay here! Go on, lift him. Where do we put him, doc? On the floor, way in the back. Gadassi, come help me! Keep the mask on. Ruso, the morphine! Give him a shot. Gadassi, check that all their masks are in place. He's bleeding hard. I'll use a tourniquet. Stretchers, over here! Help me carry him. Wait! I've got him. On the other side. Hold him tight. Put him on the ground. Hurry, doc, he's dying! I'm losing him, wait, I'm losing him... One second. Take him away. You can't stay here! Take him away. Where's the helicopter? It's a few minutes away. Hurry, we've got another one. Put him down! Gently. Klauzner, put him on an IV and let's go. Where's the helicopter? - It's beyond that hill. - Gotcha. Raise him! Put him on the side, Ruso. Gadassi, check the tourniquets! Ruso! What? Come here a second. What? I dreamt that I was burning. You dreamt what? I was burning... in a tank. Smoke everywhere... and my shoes were on fire. The hatch was jammed. It was a dream, don't think of it. Go back to sleep. You were already like that when we were recruits. This is different. This time it was terrifying. It seemed real. I was scared. Calm down, Weinraub, you're too edgy. It's always the same with you. You don't listen. I tell you, this time it was real. Nothing'll happen to you. Don't forget, we're in the same helicopter. To hell with your dreams. Let me sleep. You son of a bitch! Motherfucker! My leg's stuck in the mud. Pick him up. We'll take him like that. Get him off me! - Help us, Gadassi. - Grab a leg! Fuckin' mud! Come here. Move with me. Go round the other side. Ready? No, let's raise him. - The stretcher! - Get it! Klauzner, we'll wait for them here. Wait, I'm slipping... Get him out of the water. Get out a tourniquet! Gadassi, come over. This earth... This shit... Get me out of this mud! What are we doing here? Doctor, come dance with me. Come dance... Come dance with me! "Earth, earth... "Let me get off..." Doctor, deal with the casualty! Get me out of here! Go deal with the casualty! Calm down, Gadassi! It's me, Klauzner. It's me. Take me in your arms, Klauzner, hug me! Doctor, give him some morphine! One moment. - We've got to reach the chopper! - Hand me the radio. What's going on, doctor? What happened to him? Take off in 5 minutes. Ruso, we have to move. We have to leave him here. We have no choice. Grab all your men. The chopper leaves in 5 minutes. Klauzner, is he alive? Is he dead? We have to move, shape up! Leave him, guys. Move! Doctor, we don't have time. We gotta go! Ruso, get your men and follow me. He's breathing, he's not dead. Come on, we've got no choice. Put him in the helicopter. It's empty isn't it? You don't load the dead into a helicopter! You know that! - Let's go! - But he's not dead. Help me. We'll put him in the helicopter. Don't you understand? We don't take him, he's dead! Let's take him. We don't have time. Leave him, you hear? We're going! No, we're taking him. Kauchinski, follow me. Ruso, help me drag him into the ditch. Stand by for evacuation. Keep his mouth open. Open his mouth. Behind you, Gadassi! Ruso, put a tourniquet on him. Kauchinski, move your hand! Watch out for his leg! Hang on! Hold tight! Klauzner, his leg. They're the casualties from the helicopter. He's seriously wounded. A deep cut in the neck. Let me see. Shoulder wound. Pulse 120, pressure 180/60. - Breathing difficulties. - Breathe slowly. Put him on a respirator. Drain the left lung, pulmonary catheter, four doses of blood. Put him in intensive care. Keep me posted. One second. I won't hurt you. Put your head down. I won't touch anything, I promise. - Was the other leg hit? - No. I'll just look. Change the tourniquet. Artman 1000 plus 1000. 20 mg of Valium, repeated doses of sulfa penicillin. To the orthopedic wing for operation. Let's take a look... Yes, I see. Turn your head a bit. Open your eye. One second. OK, I saw it. Let me see the other one. Nurse. Wait... Don't move, I won't do anything. To neuro-surgery. Come this way. Hello, can you talk? Can you tell me what happened? Ruso has shrapnel in the back of his head. So be careful. I couldn't intubate Kauchinski. It was impossible. Are you the doctor? I see... Were you wounded? Me? I want to be with my mother... I'm sending you to X-rays. I won't let you talk, it'll tire you. Hang in there, doctor. To X-rays. - Hello. You came with them? - Yes. - Where are you wounded? - In the back. Yes, I see... Does it hurt when I press? - Here - Yes. - The pain spreads to your leg? - No. The leg's fine. Can you stand up all right? No problem. You'll have to watch that. - You're wounded? - No, I'm OK. You're the pilot? Can you tell me what happened? We were near Tel El Ahmar in Syria to pick up a shot down pilot. A missile hit us, then 20mm shells. Many in the back got hit, the co-pilot killed, it was shrapnel, we made an emergency landing, the mechanic got a load in his skull... He's here. We're taking care of him. - You're wounded? - No, I'm fine. I'd like you to be examined. I'm due at the base. They need me. - Doctor, we've got a problem. - I'm coming. First have them register at admission. Send them to Akko rest center. They'll take care of them. I'm swamped. Good luck, guys. - Family name? - Hattav. - First name? - Yoram. That's for you. - Family name? - Weinraub. That jeep broke my back. Weinraub... Every minute of silence is a great treasure to me. They wanted me to fly to Tel Aviv... to take Moshe Dayan to the front. I told them that he should go... to the nearest bus station. I hope you steer better than I did. You weren't so bad.
