Rise, Zasche Michael! But this looks quite good for this year. Yes. Three more minutes. You're not satisfied? How come? It looks OK. All right, let it go. That's it, my dears... Marita, sit here. The next year is going to be serious. The graduation exam is not a joke. That's why we're not thinking about it. I'm not going to be here anymore, class. Mr. Teacher, why are you giving up on us? My dear Gerber, it hasn't been very easy with you this year. Look, I'm not very young... But, teacher... This is my final year, and I don't want any more excitement. But, teacher, I believe that we can make sure that your final year be your best one. Children, you have to... Lisa, will you wait for me? THE STUDENT GERBER Goodbye, goodbye. Hello. You're going to get a postcard from Venice. When are you going? I still don't know, my father doesn't have much money this summer... maybe we will go to Alter Lake.. Yes, I'm going. Bye. Hello. Hello, Lisa. Hello. Hey, come here! Are you coming, please? Yes. Hello, teacher. Say, why didn't he greet you back? Maybe he thought he didn't need it, being a gentleman. Pig. He probably didn't see you. Does he teach anything to you? Who? Kupfer? No, thankfully. Dermanusi is my maths teacher. You know that already. Eh. They call him Kupfi the God. A little bit of slapping would be the best for him. Ah, you and your character judgement. Maybe he's poor too. - Him? It's been going well for seven years, hopefully the eighth one, too. A few of them aren't there anymore, Berwald, for example. Allegedly, she dropped out. Allegedly, she's getting married. Who is "allegedly" getting married? Rumour has it Lisa Berwald doesn't go to school anymore. At least we're going to get a new class teacher. Who? Mr. Kupfer. - Dear God! Hm, Gerber? Satisfied? There are also people who don't have to be afraid of anything. God's favourite children. The chosen ones. God is coming! Who? Mr. Kupfer. I'll wait until there's absolute silence. Sit down. I hope we will get on well. I demand the necessary effort and attention at any time. Don't ever try to cheat, Captain Kupfer sees everything. As I was a Captain in the World War who knows everything and notes everything don't expect you'll pass here with your usual tricks and wisecracks. I don't act as the mass would act. The mass always acts stupid. And you know how it is in life. The stupid ones cry in the end, and the smart ones laugh. I intend to laugh. Ha-ha-ha. Ah, I'm glad you're in a good mood. You were also very cheerful at Alter Lake. But maybe you belong among the ones who will cry in the end. Then, I hope we understand each other. You simply have to realize that the final year requires a special effort. I don't count the final exam as a simple formality. I don't act out of mercy. The one who came here for mercy is hardly going to pass. I'm especially warning those ones who are impudent to me because of their laziness. So, did we understand each other? Now, please... Altof? - Here. Benda? - Here. Modezki? - Here. Tuffeck? - Here. This ha-ha-ha is really conspicuous. I don't know, I don't know. In any case, Gerber stands out. In any case, you are an exceptional mathematician. And you really blew it. I couldn't take it anymore. He acts as if he was... - And what did I tell you? What did you tell me? - Do you have a lighter? Kupfer's presence bothers me more than Berwald's absence. The ones left are so-so... and you could at least start something with Lisa. And how do you know that, from experience? Maybe. He doesn't know that a slap is near for him. And Kupfer isn't going to treat them differently. Yes. At least he's fair. Everybody is going to be equal. Yes, if equality to you is being equally insolent to everyone. Who is absent? Are you deaf and dumb? I asked who was absent. Who did you ask? Who was that? Ah, of course. - I'm the chosen spokesperson of this class, teacher. And I'm asking for the information on behalf of the entire deaf-and-dumb class? who did you address your question to? I don't think I like this tone of voice. No one is absent, teacher. Who has the sitting plan? Please. Thank you... hmm..not bad. You are Severin? You didn't make good window proportions. or you just wanted to simulate? Severin, you stay there. We'll check the proportions of the upper plate. Quiet, please! Or is there some rule that you're not to be asked on the second day of school? Let the silent class speak now. Gerber! I don't know, teacher, it's not very common that... I didn't ask you anything. Sit down! Or you maybe want to take Severin's place? Ah, so. Severin, take your drawing. Take a good look at the furnace. Imagine it was put near the window. Which geometric figures can we show? The furnace can... The furnace looks like...- It looks like some kind of cylinder, right? Let's imagine the sunlight falling, and the 60-degree angle and then reflects off the furnace and projects the shadow on the cathetus. Hm, shadow... cathetus... How did you pass last year, with Mr. Matusi? I was sufficient at geometry and good at maths, please. And this today was not sufficient for you. Severin, you may sit down. You see, you can draw the best examples from your everyday life. Attention! A little to the right, please. You too, Mr. Teacher. Attention, please! Now! Thank you very much! Thank you! You have to go to some other school, there isn't any other way. Your son instilled something in his head and it stays that way. I'm not sure which one of us put something into his head. I have put into my head to make the road to life easier for my son. Dad... - I can do as much. Please, don't be mad, what does road to life mean? These are some stupid mathematic formulae, that's all. You are yet to learn what "road to life" means. You have to know that you need to pass that final exam. Yes, and? When I make an effort, it will be OK. I guess. I hope it won't be too late. You were never good at neither maths, nor geometry. It's ridiculous... I'm going to pass it. Good morning. - Good morning. Can I congratulate you, colleague Kupfer? On what? Your geometry work. Is there anything better? Word has it in the ministry... that the purpose of education can be achieved only by using a consistent method. Then you're satisfied with your class? I cannot say that so easily, Professor. I'm very satisfied with myself, to start with. How about Gerber? He's bad at geometry, but otherwise... - You think so? - For a very long time he doesn't belong in school, it is a distinctive characteristic. While he is here, he is Gerber, a student. Six weeks are gone, guys. What's time to us? Prepare yourself now, during the catastrophe. Come on, Scheri... You know who is here? Lisa! Hello. So, how are you? Speak. Hello. My God, we got Kupfer. Hello. You finally remembered to show up. How are you, Kurt? Thank you, Berwald, I'm OK. You're so formal, Dr Gerber. Lisa, I have a great idea. Come sit with us, and stay for the next hour. Nobody's going to notice a thing. The highest point must always have the zero elongation. See, now it can move freely... And now, when I fixate it... you need to be careful with this device. Now it cannot move freely anymore. I'm keeping it still. Yes, what does a former student Berwald want? She has to ask, because of certain obligations... for the permission to leave the class early. Granted. Class, all rise. Sit down. What happens when we move something from the down side? It will move upwards. Teacher! What's going on? I'm not feeling well. May I, please, go out? Ok, you may. What about upside... Run to Berwald. We'll try and see now what happens with the upside... The movement goes up and reflects itself... Lisa! Kurt, look at you. What's up with your appearance? What's up? Let me think... I look like I have been waiting for any news from you for six weeks and when you finally come, I need to run after you. And when I follow you, you ask what's up with my appearance. That's what's up. I might be crazy already. But, you're to blame for it. How am I to blame again? Why haven't you called for so long? I came back yesterday. You're the first person I went to. I didn't notice that. Can I phone you? Phone the studio. Excuse me? I work at an artistic studio - Dremon. It's in the phonebook. You've got a job? Of course. So, call me. Yes. Next week? Yes. And introduce yourself as Dr Berwald. That's my brother. Yes, I understand. Or should I call you? - Yes. Stay well. But really! Gerber! Do you know how to greet? What do you do in the street at this hour? Are you excused from the class? Teacher, it's... I have this... Would you take the cigarette out of your mouth while you're talking to me? Of course, teacher! I hurt my knee, and the teacher allowed me to leave the class in order to see the doctor. That sounds like a fairy tale. The entire class was laughing at you for making a fool of yourself because of that stupid goat! Lisa is not a goat, I love her. What? I love her. Say that one more time. I love her. You're a really hopeless case. Probably. We have a maths exam on Friday. You'll come then. I can't, look at my knee. Dr Kaun said that every movement... Dr Kaun had already passed his final exam, and you haven't. Friday is important, because of the test. It lacks... Yes, I can see from here, thank you. I... I am here, teacher. So... you changed your mind. You bear the consequences because you cheated, and skipped school. But, teacher, I neither cheated nor skipped school. You don't say? I remember on Tuesday morning, you were in the street during the class. You were sick on Wednesday, but today you're healthy again... rather strange. But, I can get you a slip from the doctor. Yes, we know that. Teacher, I wish you... Quiet! Gerber, I'm listening. I don't have anything to tell you, teacher. That's what I wanted to suggest. Zasche, example one... Zasche, example one... That's it, my dear Gerber. Will you stay in that position? Don't move. You think I'm stupid. I told you I saw everything. You have ten more minutes. I'm sorry... So that's it, he sees everything. Leave it, I would like to keep that. Oh, it has just occurred to me. Maths. Strict warning and ban. May I go now? You may, thank you. Good evening, could I please speak to Lisa? Mhm. Kurt Gerber speaking. Would you...? Thank you so much. Goodbye. Good night. Good night. Hello? No. No, they're at the concert. Yes, the Busch quartet. Yes, yes. No, soon, I think. Yes, I'll tell them. Bye. The Dremon studio? This is Dr Berwald speaking. May I talk to my sister, Lisa Berwald? How come? Why isn't it possible? Do you notice anything else? No. Why doesn't she call you? Firstly, she doesn't know my number. It's in the phonebook. Secondly, she knows that my folks are now angry because of my school. How thoughtful of her. Yes, how thoughtful. A magnificent gesture. Yes, a magnificent one. The Dremon studio, Dr Berwald speaking. Could I talk to my sister, Lisa? Thank you, yes. Lisa, it's me... Kurt. Why didn't you call me? I'm not threatening you, I couldn't do it. Lisa, I need you. I have to see you. Yes. Yes, I understand. But this time for real. Yes, I'll write to you. Bye, Lisa. Bye, Lisa. He's coming, he's coming. Sit down. Benda? Yes? You don't know when you are supposed to be in class? I was outside. I see, that's why I'm asking. What did you have to do outside? Things you usually do outside. Don't play with me. It's not good to joke with me. I'm asking you for the second and the last time, where were you? I went to the toilet. Silence! To the toilet. You couldn't have done it earlier? No, unfortunately not. On the contrary, you could. Basically, you had to. You had to, I tell you. That's why there's a recess. I cannot be ordered to the toilet. Complete silence, please. There's nothing to laugh about. For you, too, Benda. I'm reminding you that people need to stay in class. and that such conduct means breaking the school rules. But, when I have to go to the toilet, Mr. Teacher Then hold it until the next break. But, that's unhealthy. Johannes Kepler, the astronomer died of it. All right, now we shall see who has what rights. Zasche? What do you know about the traits of the right-angled objects which radiate? Thank you, sit down, not enough. Benda? It focuses on the shadow of one side... Thank you, not enough. Altof? This... Thank you, not enough. Severin? Thank you, not enough. Benda? The shadow focuses... Thank you, not enough. Rips? This... Thank you, not enough. Benda? Benda? Can you step out? Do you know this is refusal of obedience? Yes, I'm sure it is, teacher. Do you know anything about the traits of the right-angled objects which radiate? Thank you, not enough. Teacher, may I say something? I'm warning you, Benda, do you still intend to violate the discipline? No, I want to withdraw something I said. And that is? It wasn't Johannes Kepler, but Tycho Brache who died of it. It's not enough, from Altof to Zasche! Thank you, Gerber. Yes. You disappoint me, Gerber. Your report was exquisite, but what you generally do is senseless. What do I do, teacher? You know you're not some teachers' pet. That's how you lose sympathies of the others. Today for example, teacher Forscher complained of you. And that teacher is not as short- sighted as you think. But, teacher, nothing is... Nothing is final yet, it's true. The class teacher still has the final word. You should talk to teacher Kupfer. You know, man to man. Man to who, teacher? I have really firm intentions... I'm not interested in intentions, firm or any other kind... the only thing I'm interested in is your class conduct and your effort when it comes to maths and geometry. A single effort is not appreciated anyway, but the whole picture. Teacher? And so you can say... Teacher? What you say is not true, that's the consequence Whatever the spiritual state of the poet was... But, Gerber I'm talking about what today's literature is We'll complain against Kupfer with this. Gerber creates a revolution. Hanna. Mr. Teacher He knows he is not right, I'm sure he does. and I've been trying to talk about it with him for years. And how should I come to that? Will you, please, turn around? This is not enough against Kupfer. Four signatures. Five. What did you expect? Is it going any better with him? Kupfer? Yes, last time I answered verbally and did well. And I hope there's not going to be much more of that Hope so. Come on, don't smoke so much. Wonderful! - Beautiful! Come on, we'll ski down to the valley. Let's go down quickly so that we could catch the last train back. Peter, Otto, have you heard? Of course we are going too. Kurt? Yes, yes. There it is! Bravo! Is it cognac? - Certainly. Kurt? Yes. Is it going? Pretty much. Turn on the light. It's all right. It doesn't work. What. We've been riding for two hours already. Don't exaggerate again. Are you cold, Lisa? Just a little bit. Lisa, why can't it always be like this? It cannot be like this. Why, Lisa? What is it now? Shush, don't talk now. Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. You're ten minutes late, Gerber. Hello. -Hello. You're gonna talk to yourself. Kurt? Me, talk to myself? It would be a surprise. I'm angry at myself. I'm not gonna say a single word to myself. That's nice of you. Maxl loves Lisa. It sure is beautiful in the country. Let's move on. Come on, let's go. You better take it. Do you love her very much? Is it so incredible to you? Lisa is the most beautiful girl I know. When you're young and crazy, I find that insulting. You can love, too. Never mind, it will pass. What do you mean by that? Nothing. And for you it was successful? You don't do good with love. I don't get that? I sure doubt you haven't slept with her yet. Let it be clear that the answer to your question is going to be "no" anyway and you can interpret that as you like. How long have you been in love with her? Your Honor, it's been a year and a half. And you can't go back without her? Where? You still need to seduce her. You need to seduce her. Lisa, come here! Lisa, come! Lisa! Come on, wait for me, Lisa! Lisa! Lisa is in her room. You should go upstairs if you are willing. She isn't feeling too well. Yes? Yes? Well, here is the big man. You need to beg him to visit someone. I was walking until now. I sprained my ankle. Don't, someone might come. Please, don't. Forgive me. I fear being ridiculed. Who wouldn't? Do you ever make fun of me, Lisa? Why do you think that way about me? You won't make fun of me? Ever? You are so stupid. You went to see Lisa? - Yes. You told me to go yourself. What do you want from her? - Don't be childish. Well, you know who I am. You don't need to be jealous of me. And? - I am very happy. You are so dumb. - Yeah? It's the same thing. Wasn't it you, Paul who made a cold, yet brave statement yesterday that I would never have my beloved Lisa Berwald? Yes, I was. I believe I can prove you wrong. Wanna bet? - No. If it's really possible, there's a telegram for you, that once you'll accidentally sleep with a girl identical to Lisa Berwald. Good night. That's why you brought me back? Yes, that's why. Do you know what those four days would mean to me? My dear child, maturity starts only once. Mr. Matus thinks that an instant employment of a home tutor is the only thing that maybe can help you. And that Mr. Ruprecht should be the right guy for it. an outstanding mathematician and a friend of Kupfer's who would, maybe even at his place... Anyway, we have to be at his place tomorrow at 10. I surely won't do that! Kurt! The seriousness of life... - Seriously, you promote school too much if you think you can compare it to life. On the contrary, we must renounce life because of school. No, no, no... nobody asks you to do that. Of course they ask us to do that. And if you think that life doesn't have anything to do with school... the only thing I can tell you is you're wrong! Yeah, yeah, OK - You won't talk like that to me anymore. Hello. - Hello. Enter. What's up? Tell me loud and clear if you want to study with me. You're much better than me and probably most of the rest when it comes to "God" Kupfer. Flowers, eh? - He says "thank you". I trust you. You can keep my head above water if you want. And I promise I won't disturb our collaboration with jokes and demagogic debates. And I mean that honestly. - Please, sit down. It all works. No mistakes. You just need to draw the shadow on Pi 1. All right, Gerber. Sit down, Benda. There it is. Benda, Oh, yes, he is absent. Zasche... What is the angle of intersection of two diagonals of a cube? Incidentally, Gerber I have a very unpleasant message to convey to you... that your allegations have been proved wrong. I've heard you left the class of Mr. Ruse on Tuesday before Christmas under the pretext that you had a headache. By doing that, you lied to the two members of the teaching staff in the most brazen way Thank you, Zasche... not enough! Because of that, I organized an assembly, and you will have to sit out four hours of detention as a punishment. Take it into account and make arrangements. Mr. Teacher? - Yes? When did you plan to call for help? It's not so bad, Kurt. Come on, Kaulich, you'll give me a cigarette. That's the way to remember it. That's so-called romantic irony, right? So, how's your heart today? - I've been better for the last few days. It's partly because of you for sure. The rest is OK? - Can i quote the today's words of Kaulich my friend, who is a sober observer of the situation? "The last assignment - sufficient two verbal answers - good, what more do you want" End of quote. I knew you wouldn't embarrass your old father. Something to eat? - Yes... I'm the most complete world subject. Useless, worthless and redundant. Incapable of doing anything for myself, or others. - Kurt, come to eat! Yes, I'm coming! And the last, but not the least, Zasche. Benda is unfortunately, still absent. Lauter very good, as usual. Your certificates mostly lived up to the expectations. The fact that seven people were insufficient is more pitiful than the fact that these are your last certificates before the final exam. I can recommend you to try very hard in the remaining months. Levi, the class is not finished. The worst can rise, and the best can fall. Till tomorrow! Your two Fs are the biggest crap ever... Can I have your attention for a moment? The principal sent me to tell you that your classmate Josef Benda deceased on Tuesday. He was a great and gifted guy. Was anybody close to him? Nobody. The funeral is on Monday. Thank you. Insufficient, good, sufficient... Now me and Kaulich are going out to smoke. Levi is good. At least he has an attitude. Don't you think so? Ah, let it go. - You're giving up on me? I don't like Levi's fooling around. Then you're a suck-up like everyone else. - Yes. You know what I was thinking about? Something horrible. If I come home with that certificate and something happens to my father, I won't have to take the exam. Get it? I'm that bad. - Stop it! Nonsense! For God's sake, you've been OK lately. And anyway... Yes. - And yet... It's not so bad. I gave him a sedative so he'll fall asleep soon. Bye. Kurt, see that he is at peace now. No stress. Complete peace. I can tell you his heart won't be able to endure another such attack, do you understand? Mr. Doctor - Anything else? - I got two Fs and he's gonna think I won't pass the final, it will upset him. Don't worry, it won't upset him. Goodbye, Kurt. I got both of them pro forma for I was too weak in the first months. I would like more... - That's what Mr. Kupfer said? Yes. I would like more if you flunked the first semester but granted the final exam than to write-off these grades and jeopardize your safety. As reckless as you are, Gerber... Those were his words. It's almost a guarantee coming from his mouth. I hope you are right. Don't do that to me. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Gerber. -Prof. Ruprecht. Who is there? - Mr. Gerber, for the tuition. Let's go outside. Sit down. - Thank you. - Why so late? I expected you after Christmas. Yes, I know, but I thought... Yes, yes, a man thinks, and "God" Kupfer rules. Don't be surprised. I know about the nickname. Mr. colleague Kupfer is very famous. What's the certificate like after the semester. Bad. I have Fs in both subjects. You have to try hard. We have three more months. When do we start? Now would be best, if possible. What do you mean, now? Today? - Yes, if possible? So, it's critical. Then we won't malinger. What gives you the most trouble? I think it's integral calculus. Give me your notebook to see where we stand. Aha. Familiar with the formulae? y=x^2cosx Calculate it. Paul, come for a moment. Lunch. Excuse me. - Here you go. You'll eat this ham sandwich. Non-fat, eh? Good morning. Move it! Take your coat, it will be cold. Let's go. The bus is waiting next to the street leading to gas station. Thank you. Guess who? - I don't know. Kurt, hello. How are you. Come, sit down. I don't hear anything about you. You know, the final exam. Three months only. I completely forgot about it. How is it going? Tell me, you know anything about Lisa? - Not very much. Allegedly, she's engaged to an Italian industrialist. She's coming to me on Easter Sunday. The studio "Hellas in Wien" - a festival in Greek. You should also come. I don't know, I can't. - Have a cup of coffee. Waiter? I'll be with you shortly. I can't, I've got tuition lessons. Don't get mad. I wrote a poem. Don't be afraid, it has five verses only. I called it "About a contemporary pair of lovers" While the two of us are not ready for love we ask "why" for a long time For the two of us are the children of our time. For we are too smart for love. Or, more strictly put, too stupid! Bravo. - No, I'm only pretending. Lisa, since when are you there? How did you come to a conclusion I was not ready for love? It's funny he talks only about love, as if there's nothing more interesting. You're engaged? - What does it have to do with us? I think it has. - Not at all, Kurt. I don't allow anyone to attribute anything to me. I live my own life. I'm also a child of our time, do you know? But, I don't understand, why then... - I love you! I like you, but we won't see each other anymore. Why? It can't be good anyway. I live a completely different life. I don't want you to carry it inside you and be damaged. Kaulich also says that I'm only embarrassing myself with you. Before Paul, Otto, and everybody else. Because you probably sleep with everyone. - Kurt, you said it yourself it didn't matter if you slept with someone. Why does it matter with me? Forgive me. I'll make a suggestion. When you finish your school, we'll talk about it once more. Maybe something will be different for me, or for you. Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed for your exam, OK? This shouldn't have happened. Not that. You're a poser, a poser without a character. What happened? It's nice to be hated by someone. Then at least you have a personal success. But you don't even have that. You go to the teacher's to beg and then you're flattered by his tone. You're lazy and irresponsible. And when you don't get enough, you feel like a slave of your attitude. A sad delusion. You always justify one failure with another. You play a pathetic game. You know what you're lacking? Spine, attitude, honesty. You despise school, and you should despise yourself. It's half past eleven. I'm in a hurry. Be my guest, I'll find someone else to play with. Colleague, Gerber is basically a nice boy. Tastes are different, and so are the results. He allegedly became better, especially at your subjects. - He was decent. At least Mr. Ruprecht, his tutor, says so. Matusch, you know very well I'm incorruptible. What's that supposed to mean, incorruptible? Do you think I'm corruptible?! Anyway, gentlemen, we shouldn't have any doubts in the boy's way... and that's the most important. And it stays... - Can I say something for once, please? Is it possible, colleague Kupfer that sometimes we are to blame when students are insufficient? When maybe we treat the student wrong? I treat everyone equally. - Bad. Equally bad. I beg your pardon, colleague. You are free to guide your protégé through the final exam with the majority of votes. However, without my two. As far as I know, there are six weeks to pass until then? If you want to embarrass me in this way... Colleague Kupfer, this doesn't concern you in particular. But in their youth, soldiers were already sent to winter camps. Excellent, very good. A fantastic progress. Is it like that in all subjects? Yes, I hope so. I became more serious. I've got a new tutor. Namely, I have to pass the exam in order to work as an officer. Very good, Zasche, keep up the good work. Tuffeck? The exam won't have geography questions only. In camera caritatis, I would ask Gerber According to the geological formation of the Carpathians, or only as an example... Take this down, he gives us the exam questions. He does that every year. The formation of the Carpathians in the countries formed after the break of Austria-Hungary. I was probably confused, teacher... I'm sure I was wrong. Kurt told me at once he flunked in your subject. Of course it's my signature. - Allow me. Lying, cheating, forgery. Look at me. Aren't you ashamed of it? I haven't had bad intentions. Please, believe me. But I'd like to ask you something, father. Not to make you angry. Is it really that important? What depends on my passing the exam? Kurt, we don't understand each other anymore. We’ll never agree on that matter. You don't need to get upset, Albert. Kurt, remember what Dr Kron said. Yes. I behaved badly. Please, forgive me. Now, with the lessons of Prof Ruprecht, everything will be better. It will depend on you, on you only. Hello, Kurt. Come in. Gerber, do not disturb. Mr. Teacher, I wasn't... - Calm down at once. You're not supposed to speak if not asked to. But, teacher, it's not true I was disturbing... What do you say, not true? It's the top of your insolence! Gerber is disturbing... by cheating... during... the school assignment... and gives... despite the warning... impudent answers... What should I do? - You can't do a thing. Your father must come and go to the principal's office at once. No, my father is very ill. Can't you talk to Mr. Kupfer, please? Me? To Kupfer? No, no, I can't do that. It is over then. Kurt, you will pass the exam, won't you? Kurt, if tomorrow you have no father... You don't need to rub it in, I'm doing what I can. But, now, mother, please, go. Who do you need, Eva? - Teacher Kupfer. Colleague Kupfer? - Yes. - A lady. Ah, so. Yes? - I'm Mrs. Gerber. I would like to talk to you briefly. Unfortunately, the situation hasn't changed a bit, I've said it already... My husband is suffering a lot. He has a sick heart. He needs to go to hospital. I'm asking you to consider this. Then you're at the wrong address, dear madam. You should have said it to your son, not me. Mr. Teacher, I... - I have classes. Office hours are on Friday from 10 to 11. Good day. All right, Zasche, all right. And the big axis of the elipse is located where? In the small diameter angle. Bravo, now we also want to know where the points of the cone circular clip radius are located? Nobody knows that. Yes? You know it, or not? Thank you, insufficient. Bloodsucker. Bloodsucker! That's right. Now he's completely mad. You should have done this during the class. Well, you were good, that's the most important, right? Yes, and I'm allowed to take the exam. Yes! Of course I'm cheerful. But, tell me, how is he? Thank God. Yes. Please, Mum, put him on. OK. Father, are you up? Tell me, how are you? Ah, thank you, it's... a little better... Kurt, we've been thinking of you night and day. That's very nice of you father. Me, too. It's on Tuesday... on Tuesday. Tuesday! Yes, I'll call... right away... I promise you, father. Goodbye. Goodbye, boy. Kurt, please, don't embarrass me. - Don't worry, father. Good night. - Good night, boy. Good night. Good night, father. He's a dead man. - Kupfer will destroy him first. He's very upset... now he's afraid he's going to flunk. Maybe at least Kupfer is a little calmer. I also don't believe he needs a victim two days in a row. Mr. Chairman, allow me to introduce today's candidates. Novak, Tuffeck, Kaulich, Gerber. Novak maths, Tuffeck geography, Kaulich Latin, Gerber maths. The logarithm is 2,936. It corresponds to A, A is 40,678... Spheric trigonometry... It can be further rounded-off. 40,678 is 40,7. And that's the solution. Soon he gave a signal to go to those who were... Come on, Kaulich, it's not so difficult... Those who were hidden in the field. And now, Gerber. If I remember correctly, the first example is different. The first example is... - Mr. Teacher, I have the right to solve the tasks in whatever order I choose. It is written in the exam rules. - Don't you want to solve the first example? Gerber, Mr. Chairman asked you a question. Yes, Mr. Teacher. Someone has been paying you 2000 schillings at the beginning of each year for 12 years. and since the age of 20... And at the end of every year... every tenth year... to get your rent paid. Calculate how high the rent is with 4% interest rate. - Well? Nothing crosses your mind? Have you suddenly become deaf and dumb? That's a rent bill. - Yes! A rent bill... Thank you. Come on, calculate. Or you want to wait for the retirement in order to see how high the rent is? A little faster. How much more time do you plan to take? What is that? The sum of geometric order - Sn... sum of the first n... - Yes, nice. Well, then? Yes, you're right. It's the formula for the sum of geometric order. And now, Gerber, pay attention. How will you incorporate this formula into the rent bill? This formula for the rent bill... It's... -But, Gerber, remember... The capital E is the sum... of particularly added parts, you don't need to be a genius to know that. And now we want to hear, the parts are different, just like the factors of geometric progression. And now it's not so difficult. The final capital E is the sum of those factors. E equals r times g to the tenth degree, minus 1 divided to g-1 So, you think calmly now. Steady. You'll get there. X equals 2000. Gerber... bracketed 1,04 to the twelfth minus 1... 1,04 to the eighteenth... Now you have to work a little bit, up to now I was the only one. Use logarithms. Logarithm is... logarithm... That's enough. Thank you, candidate Gerber. How about we try the second example. - The second. Be my guest! Put it down, Gerber. You need to calculate asymptote equations. What? Asymptote equations. Asymptote equations... - Yes. - ...are... 4x squared minus 9y squared is 36. We are finished, candidate Gerber. It's all over. - Rubbish! He gave you the simplest examples, and you focused on the order. Leave me alone! Maybe you imagine that you'll be more lucky in Latin. That's for your conceit, Know-It-All! It's clear that Mr. Kupfer let you take the exam in order for you to flunk. Leave him alone already! Calm down and show that you know some German, OK? So, what do we have here? Autumn, a poem by Nikolaus Lenau. He wrote it as soon as he came back from America, in 1833. Please, read it to us, and interpret it briefly, OK? Autumn It's autumn and the leaves are falling... The pain of goodbye is rushing through the forest I miss the spring and nightingales when I'm at the lonely sea The sky appears so gentle, so bright... Its warm light disappeared A sea wave didn't blossom The high winds didn't sing... And my youth passed sadly... The bliss of spring remained neglected... Autumn brings me fear of goodbye... My heart dreams of death... This little poem is a very nice example... This little poem is a very nice example... of the Austrian lyric during the new Germany. If we compare these stanzas to the poem "To my country", we see how... this travel was an endless disappointment to Lenau. Of course, the thoughts... that occur in this poem were sad and hypochondriachal as they always were with Lenau. Growth and death, despair and hope had been following him his entire life. Lenau himself then wrote that he felt as if marked by death. Death... it goes like that... death put its hand on me... just like a woodsman who marks the trees in the forest. All right, Gerber. It's over. Thank you. All the candidates have passed the exam. Congratulations! Here you are, gentlemen. - Scheri... Scheri! Scheriiii!! Scheriiii!!
