My 'Red Sea' chills and benumbs me... ...as if I've been drenched by its freezing water To get even, I'm going to drench a Pharaoh! And you? I watch the smoke rising to the grey sky from the rooftops of Paris... ...and I think of our good-for-nothing swindler of a stove... ...sitting idly by, like some grand lord It's been a long time since he was last given decent wages What good are forests buried in the snow? Listen, Rodolfo, I've just had a profound thought: I'm frozen stiff! Well, Marcello, I won't pretend that I'm enjoying a sweaty brow My fingers are frozen... ...as if I'd kept them immersed in that ice-box of Mesestta's heart Love is a fireplace that consumes too much... ...and too quickly! -Man is the fuel... -And woman the grate... -The one is reduced to ashes... -...as the other one looks on Meantime, it's freezing... ...and we're dying of hunger - We must have a fire! - Wait... Let's sacrifice the chair! Eureka! -You found a solution? -Yes Yes, we've brains enough to burn - ideas make good fire -You mean, burn my Red Sea? -No, painted canvas makes a stench Let's burn my play - its dramatic fervour will warm our bodies What, by reading it? You freeze me As the paper burns, the poetic fire will soar back to the skies What a loss to the century! Rome is in peril Such great soul! - Act One! - Here! Tear it Burn it What blissful blaze! The Apocalypse is at hand! You can't pawn anything on Christmas Eve! A fire! -Hush! We're feeding my play... -...to the flames - Quite dazzling - So vivid! -But short-lived! -Brevity is golden Author, the chair, please! One freezes to death in the interval - hurry! Act Two Not a sound -What a profound thought! -And the perfect colour In that waning blue, an ardent love-scene flickers There goes a page And there go the kisses Now three acts all together -ldeas born of a brave spirit -Beauty vanishes in happy flames -Heavens, the flames are dying! -What a vacuous, flimsy drama! It crackles, withers, dies! Down with the author! -Cigars! -Bordeaux! -Firewood! -Bordeaux! Fortune rains down a great feast upon us -The Bank of France opens its vaults -Pick them up -Pieces of metal? -Are you mad? Who is this man? -Louis Philippe! I bow to my king! -The king is at our feet! Listen, this gold, or rather silver - it's quite a story -Stoke up the stove! -How I've suffered from the cold! Some Englishman - a Lord or Milord, or whatever - wanted a musician -Come! Let's set the table! -Where's the feast? So I offer my services and he engages me... -Cold roast beef! -Pastry! I ask: when do we begin the lessons? Will you listen! He takes me on and I ask him: 'When do we begin the lessons?' He replies: 'Right now!' He points to a parrot... ...and says: 'l want you to play till this bird is dead!' -What glow! - What pastry! -I play in vain for three long days... -Finally, I turn my charm on the maid -What, no tablecloth? -I have an idea -The newspaper! -One should not read at table! -The maid offers it some parsley... Finally, the bird spreads his wings... Lorito opens his beak - In she puts a little sprig of parsley... ...and he dies like Socrates! Who? To hell with the lot of you! What are you doing? Stop it! These provisions are our insurance... ...against the future, against those dark, uncertain days How can you think of dining at home on Christmas Eve... ...when the streets of the Latin Quarter are waiting out there... ...festooned with sausages and all those other treats? When the air is sweet with the fragrance of fritters? And young girls sing happily... It's Christmas Eve! Each girl with her student sweetheart Show some piety, my masters! We'll drink at home but we must dine out! May l? Who is it? Benoit -The landlord! -Lock the door There's no one home! The door is locked Just a word Just one! The rent! Bring a chair! - lmmediately! - Please, don't bother... -Sit down -Some wine? -Drink -A toast! -Here's the bill for 3 months' rent -How nice So you see... Another drop? -Thank you -A toast! To your health! I came to remind you that you promised last quarter to... When I make a promise, I keep it! -What are you doing? -Are you insane? See that? Now please, you mustn't leave us so soon Tell me, how old are you? -My dear M Benoit? -How old am l? Come now... -About our age, I'd say -Oh more, much more He said he's about our age You were seen the other evening with your little lady-love That's right, you were seen at the Mabille - do you deny it? It was a chance meeting -A lovely girl -Very! You rogue! You seducer! -What a man! An oak, a cannon! -And such good taste, too -Lovely tawny curls she had -You rascal! And he was leaping about, nimble and fancy-free I'm old, but I'm fit -So proud and nimble... -And he won her maidenly virtue I was shy in my youth... now I'm making up for it Such a delightful pastime... ...young girls And a little... I don't mean a mountain of blubber or a great big globe... ...with a face like a full moon But not too skinny either - certainly not! A skinny woman can be such a nuisance... and even worse She can make your life a misery Take, for example - my wife His wife? A married man nurturing such wicked desires! -He infects our virtuous dwelling! -Out! We must purify the air! Throw the adulterer out! Your morals offend us... -But... -Silence! Leave this place! And good-night to you, Sir! I've paid the rent On to the Latin Quarter! -We're expected at Momus' ! -Long live the spender! Let's divide the loot Share it out! Such beauties descended from Heaven Your're rich now, try to look it! What you need is some grooming! I'd be happy to present my head to a barber Lead me on to the razor! Let's go! I must stay a bit longer to finish my article for 'The Beaver' Well, hurry up! Just five minutes - I'm an old hand at it -We'll wait down by the porter's -lf you're late, we'll come for you! Five minutes... And make sure you cut short the ' Beaver's' tale! '-Mind the stairs!' '-Hold on to the handrail!' '-It's so dark!' '-Damn the porter!' ' Blast it!' Colline, are you dead? '-No, not yet' '-Hurry up!' I'm not in the mood Who's there? '-Excuse me' -A woman! 'I'm sorry, but my candle' 'has gone out' -Would you...? -Won't you sit down? -Thank you, but no... -Do come in Aren't you well? It's nothing You look so pale! I'm out of breath... It's those stairs... What do I do now? She looks so ill -Do you feel better? -Yes It's so cold in here Come closer to the fire... Wait... Have some wine... Thank you -Here... -Just a little, please Enough? 'What a lovely girl' May I light my candle? I'm much better now -Must you go already? -Yes Thank you... Good evening How silly of me! The key to my room... where have I put it? Don't stand in the doorway The candle is flickering in the draft Oh dear! Would you light it again? Now mine has gone out, too -But where is my key? -Damn this darkness! -How silly of me! -Where can it be? I'm such a tiresome neighbour... Not at all Yes, I am a nuisance Don't say that, please -Will you keep looking? -I am... Where can it be? Have you found it? I thought you... No, honestly -Are you looking? -I am... Your little hand is frozen... let me warm it It's no use searching, we won't find it in the dark But fortunately, we have the moonlight tonight And the moon is so close to us Just a moment, Mademoiselle - allow me a few more words... I'd like to tell you who I am, what I do and how I live May l? Who am l... Who am l? I'm a poet What do I do? I write And how do I live? I live I live in poverty Yet like a lord, I luxuriate in rhymes and hymns to love When it comes to dreams, fantasies and castles in the air... ...l can match any millionaire But my treasure chest has just been robbed... Two thieves - a pair of lovely eyes - have stolen all my jewels They stole in with you, a moment ago... ...and stole my precious dreams I've been robbed of my lovely dreams But their loss means nothing to me For they've been replaced by the sweetest hope Now that you know me... Won't you speak? Will you tell me who you are? Won't you tell me, please? Well, they call me Mimi... Though my name is Lucia There's not much to tell I embroider linen and silk, at home and out... I'm peaceful and content I find pleasure in embroidering lilies and roses I like the sort of things... ...which hold a special charm for me Things that speak of love and spring Things that speak of dreams and fantasies Things that can be called poetry Do you understand? They call me Mimi I don't know why I cook and eat my meals alone I don't often go to church But I pray a great deal I live alone, all on my own... ...in a little room that looks out over the rooftops and the sky But when the snow thaws... ...The first rays of sun belong to me The first kiss of April is mine The first ray of sunshine is mine I keep a rose in a vase... ...and I inhale its fragrance The perfume of a flower is so delicate But, alas, the ones I embroider have no perfume There is nothing more to tell I am your neighbour and I'm intruding on you 'Rodolfo! Are you deaf?' '-You crawling snail!' '-You verse-monger!' A few lines and I'm done -Who are they? -Friends '-We'll get you for this!' '-What are you up to all alone?' I'm not alone, there are two of us Go and save a table at Momus'. We'll be with you shortly 'Momus, quietly and discreetly,' 'here we come!' 'The poet has found his muse' - You lovely girl... - 'The poet has found his poetry' Sweet vision, shimmering in the moonlight In you I behold the dream I have always dreamed Love alone commands me! -Such ecstasy stirs within me... -Love, you alone command me! How sweetly his words fall upon my heart -Love awakens in a kiss -Love alone commands me! Please, you mustn't... You're mine Your friends are waiting Are you dismissing me already? I'd like to say - but I dare not... Say it What if I came with you? What, Mimi? It would be so lovely to stay here It's cold outside I'll be near you -And later on? -Don't be curious! Give me your arm, my little one I obey you, my Lord Say you love me I love you! The D is flat! How much for the pipe and horn? -Come on -To buy the bonnet? -Hold on to my arm -I'll cling to you... let's go 'I'd like to sell something, too' Young ladies, who would like to buy a bit of love? I'll strike a bargain with you: I'll sell my pure heart for a penny! The crowd shoves and pushes, never tired of chasing every cheap whim A rare copy, quite unique - a Runic grammar! -Where's Rodolfo? -At the milliner's -Come on, my friends are waiting -Does this pink bonnet suit me? It goes well with your dark curls What a pretty coral necklace My uncle is a millionaire With God's good will, I'll buy you a prettier one -Let's follow the others -Take care, girls! -What a din! What a crowd! -Let's go down Rue Mazarin I'm suffocating here! Come on, let's go to Momus' Look, the cafe is right here! Let's go to Momus' Who are you looking at? -Are you jealous? -A happy man is always jealous When I'm full, I need lots of room -Are you happy? -Yes, very -And you? -Very happy Two places! At last! This is Mimi, who embroiders flowers Her presence completes this charming company... ...because I am the poet... ...and she is the poetry My brain makes verses flourish Her fingers make flowers blossom And our two ecstatic hearts together make love bloom! Good Lord, what an original concept! Worthy of our company An essential ingredient All I have to add is " I second that" Here comes Parpignol with his toys! One sausage here! Parpignol! Here is Parpignol! With his cart all lights and flowers -I want the horn! -I want the pony! -The drum, the tambourine! -The cannon, the whip! -Roast venison -A turkey for me -Some table wine! -A shelled lobster! You scamps, you little devils! What are you doing here? -Get home to bed, you rascals! -Just you wait and see! The trumpet, the toy horse! -What would you like, Mimi? -Some ice-cream Splendid - now there's a lady for you! I say, Miss Mimi, what rare gift has your Rodolfo given you? A pink embroidered bonnet that goes well with my dark hair I've wanted such a bonnet for so long And he has read what I've kept secret in my heart He who can read the heart surely understands love -He must be a sage -And a true scholar He already has his diplomas, and his rhymes are not crude weapons In fact, whatever he expresses has the ring of truth Oh those beautiful days of illusions and utopia! When you're full of faith and hope, how lovely it all seems The most divine poetry... ...is that which teaches us to love Love is sweeter than honey Each to his taste - it's either honey or gall -Goodness, have I offended him? -He is grieving, Mimi Come, a toast! Bring more wine! Down with our troubles, up with our glasses! Let's drink And bring me some poison! -There she is! -Musetta! -Look, it's Musetta! -What style! She treats me like a slave! -Eat here? Outdoors? -Sit down, Lulu Don't call me that! Save it for those who deserve it Don't be a Bluebeard! -How's that for dignity? -With that chaste Susanna! She's very well dressed -Angels need no clothes -Do you know her? Who is she? Ask me. Her name is Musetta '-Marcello has seen me...' -Her middle name is Temptation! - Being fickle is her vocation - 'He ignores me!' -Skipping from lover to lover... ' -They all make me sick!' A screeching owl! If only I could scratch A bird of prey, living off men's hearts And here I'm stuck with that old pelican She eats hearts... That's why I have none Waiter! This plate smells of stale oil Please, Musetta, not so loud... He won't look at me! -I could hit him! -To whom are you speaking? -Who are you talking to? -To the waiter! Leave me be -I'll do as I please -Not so loud! -I'll say what I like -Softly, softly -Look who's here! It's Musetta! -With that old babbler -He can't be jealous of this mummy! -Propriety... manners... upbringing We'll see if I've lost the power to bring him round What a splendid farce -You won't look at me? -I can't, I'm ordering our meal Quite splendid! Just bear in mind one thing... Once slighted, I never forgive! She speaks to one and is answered by another I love you so much, I'm all yours... why talk of forgiveness While the other, cruel and vain... ...pretends not to understand but keeps promising honey! Yet your heart is hammering! Speak softly As I wander alone in the streets... ...people stop to stare and drink in my beauty from head to toe Tie me to my chair! What will people say? 'As I see the flames of mute desire... '...in their eager, entreating eyes... '...l am transported by a swelling tid 'of my own yearning' This silly song turns my stomach - 'You know, you remember, you suffer' - The poor girl is quite in love 'You cannot avoid me! I feel the' 'anguish you never show...' 'l know you well,' 'you feel dead inside!' What will people say? Marcello loved her once, but the vixen left him for the easy life Lovers adore their chains, both the binder and the bound Colline will never fall into such a trap She's very pretty, I grant you... The braggard is about to give in -Softly, please, softly... -I'll do as I please! Leave me be! -The poor girl moves me to pity -Sullied love should be avenged! Leave me be! 'l must get rid of the old boy!' What is it? Such pain, it's burning! Where? My foot! 'My youth is not dead yet' There's a shoe shop over there, hurry! 'My memory of you is not yet dead!' Go and buy me another pair! 'lf you were to knock at my door' 'l would run to open it' You siren! We've reached the last act! The bill! So soon? Who asked for it? Let's see -It's a lot -Out with the money The rear guard! Where's my fortune gone? The rear guard is coming! Let me have the bill Quickly, add this to the other bill The gentleman I was with will take care of it The gentleman will pay Put it at his table and give him my respects! Let's get lost before the old boy catches us with his prey You there... open up! We're the street sweepers... It's snowing Hurry up! We're freezing Coming! 'Who found pleasure in his glass' 'and love in a pair of lips?' 'There's pleasure in a glass' ' But young lips are made for love' The milk-maids are here Butter and cheese! Poultry and eggs! Which way are you going? To Saint Michel Shall we meet later? At noon! Can you tell me... which way is the inn? There's a painter here, painting some inn Good woman, would you go and fetch the painter, Marcello I have to talk to him urgently Tell him Mimi is waiting for him out here What's in that basket? -It's empty -Pass! I hoped I'd find you We've been living here a month at the innkeeper's expense Musetta gives the guests singing lessons And I paint the soldiers and decorate the inn's walls It's cold Come on in -Is Rodolfo in? -Yes Then I can't go in - I can't Why not? Dear Marcello, help me What's happened? Rodolfo loves me He loves me yet he shuns me... He is eaten up with jealousy A gesture, a word, a friendly kiss, a flower... Anything will make him suspicious He quarrels with me, he gets into rages At night, I often pretend to sleep... ...and I can feel him trying to pry even into my dreams He keeps yelling: You're not for me! Get yourself another lover! You're not for me! It's his anger speaking, I know... But what can I say to him, Marcello? A love like yours makes it hard to live together You're right, that is true... We must separate Will you help us? We've tried to help ourselves, but we cannot do it I don't worry about Musetta, nor does she about me - We love in fun and laughter - It's true Yes, we must separate Songs and laughter - these are the blooms of constant passion Do what you can for us Very well -I'll wake him up -ls he asleep? He came in about an hour before dawn and fell asleep on a bench Look That cough... It's been wearing me out since yesterday He fled from me last night, saying: It's over! At daybreak I hurried over here to find you He's awake, he's getting up... He's looking for me... -He's coming -He mustn't see me Go on in, Mimi, for pity's sake Don't make a scene! That's it, Marcello! No one can overhear us now I want to part with Mimi Are you so volatile then? Once before, I thought that my heart had died But in her blue eyes it found so much to live for But it's all so tedious now You wish to mourn another? Once and for all Change your rhymes This gloomy love of yours... ...can lead only to tears Without fun and laughter love grows weak and fragile -You're jealous -A little You are an angry, prejudiced, tiresome and stubborn lunatic Now he'll make him angry! Poor me! Mimi is a flirt She toys with them all Some Viscount dandy makes eyes at her... ...and she lifts her skirt and shows her ankles, full of promise Need I say it? You don't sound sincere You're right, I'm not In vain I try to hide my true misery I love Mimi above all else I love her but I'm so afraid Mimi is so ill! She declines every day The poor girl is condemned What does he mean? A terrible cough shakes her fragile chest... ...and her cheeks are already drained and ashen Alas, I am dying... My room is a squalid hovel The stove is dead Only the north winds come in to play there She sings and smiles and I'm consumed by remorse I am the culprit leading her to her death! What can we do? Oh, my life is over! -Mimi is a hot-house bloom -How pitiful! -Poverty has robbed her strength -Poor creature My love alone cannot bring her back to life What? Mimi, you're here? '-So she was listening...' -You overheard me? I worry so easily and panic over nothing -Come in to the warmth -No, it's stifling in there That's Musetta's flirtatious laughter! You flirt! I'll teach you Farewell! You're leaving? I came in with joy when your love called me Now Mimi must go back to her lonely nest Back to her embroidery and her flowers Goodbye... And no regrets! Listen to me! Gather up the few things I've left behind There are things I locked away in my little chest My gold bracelet, the ribbons and my prayer book Wrap them up in an apron And I'll send someone to get them Under my pillow you'll find my pink-coloured bonnet Keep it, if you like, as a memento of our love Farewell... Goodbye, with no regrets! Then it really is all over? You're leaving, my little darling? Farewell, my dream of love Farewell, sweet morning awakenings! -Goodbye, life of dreams! -Goodbye, quarrels and jealousy Those quarrels that your smile soon soothed away -Goodbye, suspicions... -...and kisses... ...and poignant bitterness... The bitterness which l, the poet, rhymed with "tenderness" -ln winter one can die of loneliness -Loneliness is too unbearable Whilst as spring awakens, we have the sun! -What were you doing with that man? -What do you mean? 'No one is ever alone in April' When I came in you changed colour He asked if I like to dance... I said I could dance all night 'The whispers of lilies and roses' 'The sweet chattering of birds' -Deceitful excuses! -I must have my freedom! You won't find horns under my hat! 'When spring blooms' 'we have the sun!' I hate lovers who behave like husbands! 'The fountains murmur and evening' 'breezes bring balm to human anguish' 'Shall we wait for another spring?' -Sir, I'm delighted to say goodbye -Your servant, and I'm off -House painter! -Viper! -Toad! -Witch! 'Forever yours, for life' 'We must part...' ' But let us part when the flowers' 'are in season' 'lf only the winter could last forever In a coupe? With livery and pair; she smiled at me Well, Musetta, I said, and how is the heart? Either it stopped beating or I can't hear it... ...covered by velvet as it is! How very interesting Go on, you fraud! You suffer, yet you laugh Her heart stopped beating? Good! - l, too, met... - Musetta - No, Mimi... You saw her... did you now? She went past in a carriage, dressed like a queen Good, I'm happy to hear it The liar, he's in agony -Back to work! -To work! Useless pen! Useless brush! Mimi, gone never to return, those lovely days... Those tiny hands, that fragrant hair... My brush seems to be at her command... That snow-white skin... -Mimi, my brief youth -lt paints against my will! If I want to paint skies or land or winter or spring... ...it still traces two dark eyes... ...and red, smiling lips It's the face of Musetta over and over again -And you, gay bonnet... -And there is Musetta's face... -...which she left under her pillow -...all charm and deceit -You, witness to our short-lived joy.. -Yet Musetta blooms and flourishes... -Come to my dead heart... -And my humble heart calls to her... -Come to me, for love is dead... -My heart calls to her and waits... What time is it? Time for yesterday's dinner And Schaunard isn't back? -Here we are -Well? A dish worthy of Demosthenes: -A herring! - Salted -Dinner is served! This is a veritable horn of plenty Put the champagne on ice Choose, Baron, trout or salmon? Perhaps a parrot's tongue, Duke? Thank you, no, it's too filling... I'm going to a ball tonight Finished already? I'm late - the King expects me Not another conspiracy! The King has summoned me to the Ministry Good! However... I shall see... Guizot Hand me the goblet You drink - I'll eat I beg permission of this noble assembly... -Enough! - What a concoction! -Away with the heel! I feel irresistibly inspired by a romanza -A choreographic piece then? -Yes! A dance to a vocal accompaniment Clear the floor A gavotte A minuet A pavane A fandango I propose a quadrille Choose your partners I'll do the calling A charming maiden... A little respect for my modesty, pray... ' Balancez' -The 'Rondo' first! -No, you fool! The manners of a lackey! I believe I've been insulted! -Draw you blade! -Ready! Try me! I'm thirsty for your blood One of us will end up minced Fetch a hearse Fetch a cemetery And as the duel rages, Rigaudon whirls and dances I've brought Mimi! She's ill -Where is she? -She's too weak to climb the stairs Bring the bed forward Some water... Hush now... You must rest My Rodolfo! Do you want me here with you? My Mimi... Always, forever! I heard that Mimi had left the Viscount... She was fading fast But where could she be? I searched and searched... And just now I saw her on the street... She was hardly able to walk 'l cannot last', she said. 'I'm dying, I know it... 'l want to die with him! He may be waiting for me' I feel better already 'Come with me, Musetta', she said I want to look around... How good it is to be here I feel revived... -I can feel life returning -Blessed lips... -You will never leave me again... -To hear your voice again... We've nothing in the house! Ah, poverty! She won't last the hour I'm so cold, so cold... If only I had a muff! Will these hands never feel warm again? Here, warm them in mine Hush now! Talking tires you It's just a slight cough! I'm used to it Good day, Marcello... Schaunard, Colline, good day... Here you all are... -You're smiling at Mimi again -Don't speak I'll speak softly, don't worry Marcello, listen to me - Musetta is so good and kind I know Here, take these... Sell them and bring back a cordial... And fetch a doctor -Rest now -You won't leave me? This may be the last time she'll ever express a wish... The poor thing! I'll buy her a muff... I'll come with you You're a kind soul, Musetta Well, my old trusty cloak... I stay, but you must climb up the sacred mount as my pledge Let me express my gratitude now Never have you bent your ancient back to the rich and powerful... But many are the philosophers and poets... ...who have passed through the tranquil chambers of your pockets Now those pleasant days are over So I say farewell, my faithful friend Schaunard, we can both do an act of kindness, each in his own manner I - with this coat And you... ...by leaving them to themselves Philosopher, you talk sense It's true, I'll go Have they all gone? I pretended to be asleep... Because I wanted to be alone with you... There are so many things to say... Or perhaps only one thing - as vast as the sea... ...as the deep, limitless sea You are my love and my life! Mimi, my lovely Mlmi... Am I still lovely then? As lovely as the dawn You've used the wrong expression... You meant to say as lovely as the sunset They call me Mimi... I don't know why... The swallow has returned to the nest My bonnet! Remember the very first time I came here? As if I could ever forget... My candle had gone out You were so perturbed... then you lost your key And you were groping in the dark to find it I searched and searched... My cunning boy... I can tell you now I know you found it almost at once I was only assisting destiny It was dark and you couldn't see my blushes Your tiny hand is frozen! Please, let me warm it It was dark and you took my hand What is it? It's nothing, I'm fine Hush now, for pity's sake Yes, forgive me... I'll be good -ls she asleep? -Only resting I saw the doctor! He'll be here soon Here is the cordial Who is that? It's me, Musetta How lovely and soft it is... No more frozen hands, now... How warm... It feels so good... -Did you get it for me? -Yes! You... how extravagant... Thank you! It must have cost a lot... Are you crying? But I feel fine... Why are you crying then? My love... ...is always with you! My hands... ...so nice and warm... ...to sleep -What did the doctor say? -He's coming Blessed Madonna... Grant your grace to this poor girl and do not let her die We need some sort of shield... the flame is flickering Please, make her well again... Holy Madonna, I am unworthy of forgiveness But Mimi is an angel from Heaven -I still hope. Does she seem worse? -I don't think so Marcello, she is dead! Musetta, take this How is she? As you see, she is peaceful Why is everyone runing around? Why do you look at me like this? You must be brave!
