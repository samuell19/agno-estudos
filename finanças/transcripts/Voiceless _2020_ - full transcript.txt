Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Well, in the fight against the terror group Boko Haram, the frontline is Sambisa forest. And so it begins. - Food is ready. - Mother! Honestly, Mother, we can't eat now. We are in a hurry. Musa! Musa! Yes, Goni! Hurry up! I will be out shortly. He knows nothing but food. I will hit you. Hurry! Or I will leave you. Take care of yourselves. God be with you. Amen, Mom. Are you not eating? It was beautiful living here. It was fun. There was love and laughter. It didn't matter that we were poor. I think the gods hate life being so peaceful. So they turn our world on its head. Then they sit to watch. Hey! Where are you? Open this shop! Open up now! Open up! Open up! Lamido, go in! Take the drugs. Kill everyone, spare no one! Pack everything. Let's go! Pack everything, let's go! Bulus. Goni, how are you? I'm fine. You are here with Musa today. Yeah, his school fee is not complete. So he is here to make it up. That's right. I hope you know he is a flirt. He needs to be careful. Really! Run for your life! Don't shoot. Musa! I said, don't shoot! We need them. You! And you! Go in there and bring them all. Musa! If you run, I will shoot you. This way! Move your legs! Move out! That's how they operate. Men were kidnapped. Goods were looted. That was their mode of operation. One of these days, you're going to scare the wits out of me. You know I can never stop being mischievous around you. How are you? I'm good, and you? Ah! -Hungry. - Aw. Look at you, you're hungry. Your meal is ready. -It's ready, right? Good. - Yes. Go in, relax. Salma will bring your food. Did Sadiq bring what I asked him to? Yes, he brought it. Salma! Salma! Salma! Salma! Salma! Salma! On that premise, my friends, we should join hands and work together for the good of the society. If you educate a girl-child, you educate a nation. Salma, you make me proud. I am very glad we are friends. Soon we shall tour the world, educating people about the girl-child. Places like America, India, China... I love China. And other countries. Very soon. Salma! Why are you this stubborn? When will you understand you are a lady? Hmm? Do you want to be wayward? And you, Kauna. Who is helping your mom at home? But honestly, Mom, a girl's place is not only in the kitchen. What? Don't be silly! Now carry your water home. We've been waiting for you to get back. Now take this bucket home. Make sure I don't get home before you. Hurry up! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down. Come down! Come down! Get down! They took us from our villages, far into their camp in the forest. I hope my mother and sisters are safe. Are they all here? Yes, they are. These two, take them over there. Let's go! Let's go! These two should tend to Lafiya's toilet. These two should help the ladies in the kitchen. Move forward! - Move! - Are these the last two? Yes, yes. Take them to the workshop. So, they brought us here to their armory to make arms like those used to kill Musa and slaughter our people. Move it! The gods like to stir the waters. Welcome to the team. Our eyes are on you. But, it looks like this storm had just begun... Secure the perimeter. Goni, isn't that Lamido? Be strong. Be strong, Goni. Where you are, you'll get the answer to this. So when we sum this up, we divide it by this? Yes? Correct! This is how we get the correct answer. Good morning, ma'am. How are you? Behave, Kauna. Calculators won't be allowed at the exams. -Really? - Yes. You must learn to work without calculators. Good morning, Miss Binta! Good morning, my students. It's been a while, ma'am. -Salma. - Yes. Do you have a minute? -OK. - Step out. The PTA meeting is next week, so what I did... OK? ...was tell the head teacher it would be best for you to present the importance of girl-child education. Me? Thank you very much, ma'am. I really appreciate that. You are welcome. I'm proud of you, Salma. Make sure you give it your best! I promise I'll give it my all. I will not let you down. Good! You can return to your class. Thank you, ma'am. Did you hear what she said? Every bit! You'll go through here. The rest of us will go in through the other route. Then we attack in the middle. Boss. If we attack them this way, they might overpower us. Only if we do not show our strength. Make way! Settle down! Commander. -We captured more... - So? Where are they? The new kids should watch and learn. Tomorrow is their day. They are a part of us now. By this time tomorrow, the world shall know who we are. Soldiers of Paradise! Make way! Tomorrow, we meet at 9:30 a.m. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Before I begin... Salma! Why are you still up this late? Father. Thank God you're here. I need your help. -You need my help? - Yes. OK, what is it? I need help with my speech. I'll be presenting it tomorrow. I'm having some difficulty. OK, read it out. -Good day, ladies and gentlemen. - Mm. It's a pleasure to come before you. Mm... It's a privilege standing before you. OK. It's a privilege standing before you. And an honor to present... Lamido, where are you all headed? Why do you ask? Where are you going? I'm going with them. What are you doing here? I want to go with you. Do you know how to use a gun? No. Hand him a rifle. He is coming with us. Soldiers of Paradise! Soldiers of Paradise! Let's go. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Once again, thank you all for honoring our invitation. Shh. We will now call on one of our students, Salmatu Iliya, for today's presentation. Go, Sally! Go, Sally! Good morning, everyone. Teachers and my fellow students. Hey... Take them all! Anyone who resists, kill them! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! I am happy. This is great. Now the world has felt our might. And will be forced to release our comrades. They're in your care. My only instruction: None should be harmed. Soldiers of Paradise! You! Get up! What's wrong with her? You, get a doctor to check her. You, you, you, you... you, you, you... and that one! Take them inside. Get up! Please don't take her. Take me instead. Take her to my room. The rest to the common room. Up! Get up! Move! Move forward! Move it! Move in quickly! We feel your pain and promise to double our effort. Rest assured, by God's grace, we will bring your children back. Thank you. This is shocking, honestly! We're devastated. Sir, look at her. She's my daughter. She's all I have. Please help me. Please help me. We'll try our best. Eat! You! Stand up! You! Stand up! You! Stand up! - Take them out! - Let's go! I said move! Eat! Go! Where are you taking them? I'm taking them with me. So what? Lie down! Spread your legs! Salma! I said spread your legs! Lie down I said! Please, I beg you... Quiet! Quiet! How could you be a part of this? They threatened me... But that won't make me join them. If you continue asking questions, you'll die soon. Get away from here! Sorry. Hold her, I'll be back. Sir. Please help! Don't let her die. Don't let them see you talking to me, they'll kill you. Yes, I know! But we're in need of drugs. Go. Did you get the drugs? No. What's happening here? Get inside! Salma! Quiet! I said quiet! Spread your legs! Go in! They'll kill you! Who's out there? Hey! Get inside! Let's go back! Spread your legs! Keep quiet! She is dead. I can't believe you're one of them. I am not one of them. Prove to me you're not one of them. How? Help us get out of here. Get back inside! Please speak to the government on our behalf so our children won't be killed by these monsters. OK, mister? Mr. Iliya. Mr. Iliya. We will tell the government everything that has happened. Rest assured your children will return home. Please be calm. Thank you. Sir. Sir, please help me. How can I help you? Who is she? She's my older sister, I haven't seen her in two days. She was also taken away. What about your dad? He is dead. Oh. Take this, sir. Please, this is all I have. Help me put her picture up on the board. Please, sir. Please don't cry. Thank you. Who is this? My younger brother. He is the only one left at home. He has only one arm. Who will feed him? I am all he has. Who will take care of him? I'm sorry to hear this. So sorry. So sorry. How did you get here? It's a long story. I just had to see you. I heard they hit you. It's nothing. I'm fine. I'm happy to see you. Me, too. Hey! Who's there? It's me, Goni. Goni? Bulus. I didn't know you were back. What are you doing here? I brought someone here. You brought a lady here? Where is she? She is inside. Do you know the risk you are taking? Let's go, let's go! Don't be scared. He's with me. Who is this? Don't worry, he is my friend. We're together. Are you sure they're with us? Yes, they are. Don't worry. Be calm. These people took us from our homes, from our families. From our families, to humiliate us. Even though we can't fight back, we will do something to help ourselves out of this place. So be calm. The Commander wants two of you tonight. You, you. Stand up. Goni, you have to leave this place now. The guards are almost done eating. You heard him, right? We have to leave immediately. We don't have time. Amen. We shall gain our freedom. But we have to be strong. We can. Everything will be fine. Umar. Umar. Please stop crying. I don't want to imagine what they are doing to my daughter. She's a small girl. Very young. Don't worry, my brother. You will see her again. Please, you have to help. I pray she is not being molested. Please help. I'll do all I can to help you. She's my daughter as well. Please help. Very soon the world will be aware of what we're going through in this community. I promise you. I see her! There she is! Hey! Hey! Stop! Bring her down. Silly thing! You think you can escape, right? Lamido! Gulama! Gather them here! Let them see the penalty for her action. Let's go. Move out! Quickly! Let's go. Quickly! What's happening? She tried to escape. Move! Commander! What's happening? Commander. She tried to escape, or should I say, she escaped. And she was caught. Help her up. -You know the penalty? - Hmm. Death. This should be a lesson to you all. Anyone who tries to escape-- when you are caught, the penalty is death. Take her away. Take them away. Let's go, let's go. This is the penalty. Quiet! Salma! I'm so sorry. I'm still feeling guilty. I could have done something to save her life. I'm sorry. You have to help us escape. Escape? How? If we do nothing, we will all die here. We have to do something for those girls. You have to help. Please, in the name of God. Two of you, go over there! The rest of you, follow me! Bulus. What's happening? Hunters are attacking. We can't continue staying here. I have to go with the rest of the girls. Are you out of your mind? Moments ago, you asked me to help you escape. Not just me, I was referring to all of us. Go over there! These are just hunters! Kill them all! Come over! Quick. Be quiet. Protect the rest. I'll be back. Keep moving! Keep moving! Don't stop! Salma, go. I'm going nowhere without the rest. Please, Salma, go. I'm not leaving. I'm going back. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. RPG! They're trying to escape. Shut your mouth! And you! What are you doing here? I ran to hide. I found her outside and asked her to go in. Get inside! - Quiet! - Quiet! Shh. You want to escape, right? I'll deal with you all. Take them to the dark room. Let's go. Move! Get in! Bulus! Where do you think they're taking them? What will they do to them? Is it her fault? I don't understand. You're in love with her, right? Don't worry. You're my friend. I know what to do. What? Stop there! Who do you want to see? I'm here to see the Commander. Tell the Commander Bulus is here to see him. You can go in. Go alone! Stop here! Don't expect me to raise my voice for you. Tell me what brings you here. I have a plan on how to defeat our enemies. I inherited that from my father. I can make bombs and guns too, that will help us win this battle. I know that. What do you want? I want one of the girls. Who is Salma? Me. Are you? Wait. Hey! Where are you taking her? Commander has a husband for her. I'm sorry, boss. Commander, she is here. Who is she? The one I spoke to you about. Hey! Stop there. What's happening here? Stand! Hey, you! Step back. Commander, not me, it's him. No! He's not the one. You are. Give me your hand. Give me yours. No. Give me yours! I join you both. That's final! Really? You can't do whatever you like in my territory-- It's mine. I don't need your permission.

So you have the energy to disturb the peace here, right? You! Bring her out. Drag her here! Hey! She's supposed to be your responsibility. I've been looking for her. Where have you been? Why are you so stubborn? Thank you for bringing her back. Let me punish her. Hey! I give... the punishment. I've heard what you said, but I want to punish her. Hey! I give the punishment! I said I heard you. But I will punish her! She's my wife. Whatever is going on between you and Lafiya, I want you to know that there is one penalty, one wrong move, and you're gone. Soon, we shall see. Watch him. Let's go! Move it! Where are you going? Do you have a death wish? I'd rather die than have you as my husband. What's wrong with you, Salma? Why can't you understand? We're doing all this to save your life. They need me. I can't leave them! How will you help if you're dead? Salma, Goni loves you. I've never seen him love any other girl the way he loves you. I'm sorry. Goni! Goni! Since when did you start smoking? How was your honeymoon? Do you believe I will touch her? I don't know what to believe. I don't understand why Lafiya did that. So I'm here to make things right. How? Salma... we must help her escape. You must be crazy. You don't understand what I'm saying. They will kill her. What if she's caught? You say "what if", but we have to try. Remember... We make the arms used in their killing spree. In my sleep, I hear the cries of little children and women being killed. We have to get at least one person out of this place. Honestly, I can't. You are a coward. These people took everything from you. They killed your people. Instead of fighting back, you'd rather remain a slave in this camp? You are my friend, but you are a coward. You're not being reasonable. Are you sure that's what you want to do? Yes, please help me. I need to speak to him. They'll kill you. I know, but you have to help me. I need to speak to him. Stop there! Who are you? I was sent from the kitchen. She's one of us. Please, Commander, can I speak with you? Your grave has been dug. It's been dug. I'm willing to go there if you grant my wish. I see it in your eye. This is not what you want. Please let my friends and me go. You speak the truth. This is not what I want. What I do want is for women like you who talk too much to learn the art of silence. Return home. Learn our tradition. Get married. And stop speaking... in the language of gamblers and cheats, which you have learnt. The language which is not yours, but brought into our culture... must stop! It's the language of infidels which has confused you. Finally, I have a need. I will bring an end to this devil called schools. That gets you engaged in worthless studies. To be lawyers and doctors. Instead of going back, help yourselves and the children you will have. Take this message to your friends. That is the reason why I won't kill you. You may leave. Hey! Who is there? Who goes there? It's me, Bulus. What are you doing here? Goni, what's happening? I don't know. - Let's go after him. - Get in! Goni! Banza has people spying on us. Salma, you have to leave this place. Tonight? I can't leave the others behind. You're not leaving them. You're helping them survive. Go. Tell people what we're going through here. Don't worry, Salma, nothing will happen to you. You will meet the hunters on your way. They will help you. Be calm. Should I go with her? Don't worry, nothing will happen to her. Follow me. Go back to your tent. Go back to your tent. - Move! - Move! Quickly! This way! Goni! Goni! She has been caught. -Salma has been caught. - What! Salma has been caught. What, again? She tried to escape. What? What? You know the penalty! Death! Death is the penalty. Death will not be her penalty. Death will not be her penalty if she's married to one of us. This is not her husband. He is her husband! That's a lie. Take her then. Do what you have to do. To prove to us you are the husband. No! No way. Commander, I told you. - I told you. - Hey! Listen! Listen! Are you not her husband? Are you her husband? This is what I want. And so shall it be. Go to your husband. Go, be with your husband. Back to your tent! Move it! Back to your tent! Commander. I know I was wrong. Forgive me. I was angry. Very angry. We would have been humiliated if she had escaped. That's why I did what I did. Please forgive me. Hm. All right. It is OK. Go back to your duty post. Useless!

It's coming. Easy! Push! Push! Push. It's coming. Easy. Easy. Push! Push! One more push and it's here! Push! Push! Goni! It's a boy! It's time we take back our territory. It's time to take back our territory from the useless commander. True! Commander doesn't know what he is doing. Are you sure of this? What if we do not succeed? What happens then? All I want from you all is to join me. Let's take back our territory. The territory people outside-- they feel we've lost control of, let's take it back! From village to village! True! Tomorrow morning, you know where to meet us at 10:00 a.m. If you're not with me... it means you are a traitor. Salma! What's happening? Banza and his boys are staging a coup. We have to leave now. Are you aware of what's happening? Yes. Let's go! You have to get the others from the big tent. OK. Let's go! Let's go. Be calm. Be calm. This is the 10th month we have not heard anything from our children. We've not heard anything from them. We don't know what they're going through. Are they taking advantage of them? We still want them alive because they are our children. We must do something. Let's not sit back and wait for anyone to help us. We have to help ourselves, nobody will help us. Nobody will help us. Let's go do what we must to bring our children home. Leave! Let's go! We must be prepared to fight, even if it means to death, to ensure these heartless creatures do not kill our children! Goni! I'll meet you on the way. I need to help Lafiya. Where are you going, Bulus? Hold on! Salma, go on. I can't leave him behind. He is my friend. Please go. Salma, go. Take care of yourself. You know I love you. I love you, too. I'll catch up with you. Commander! Goni, where did you get that? Can you handle it? I'll have to try. Banza and his men have taken over the camp. We are surrounded, but there's an escape route we can go through. We can lead you out. Those living in fear will know no peace. I am going nowhere. I am fearless. It's happening already. You have not seen what the world has turned to. If we go out, they'll get us. And we will do the same. You have to hurry up then. I'll face them. You can go. Lafiya! Come outside! Commander! Let's go. Forget it! Lafiya, come out! Save yourselves. Leave! Lafiya! Lafiya! I knew you never liked my honest leadership. You're a traitor. I am fearless. I am not afraid of death. Never! It's better I die than live in fear. Calm down. What's happening? We were abducted by the Soldiers of Paradise. All right, don't worry. Calm down. You're in safe hands now. My son has not eaten for two days. Secure the area. Follow me. The Nigerian Army says it's rescued more than 1000 people held captive by Boko Haram in Borno State. Most are women and children, and also some young men who were forced to become fighters for the terror group. CNN's Farai Sevenzo joins us from Nairobi... Salma! Salma! Salma! Salma! We give God the glory. Salma! Thank you, God. Salma is back! Thank you, God! To God be the glory! To God be the glory! To God be the glory! To God be the glory! To God be the glory! Salma is back! Whose baby is it? Salma. Salma. Salma? You didn't succeed in bringing the girls back, you stupid fools! Lamido. It's time. Go, carry out your mission. Salma, your hair has been tied up for 10 months. It will surely hurt you. -Mother! - Be calm, let me fix it. My son is crying. This child cannot stay in this house. It is impossible. Father, I thought this issue was settled. I won't repeat myself. This child must leave this house. I don't understand, but we spoke about this already. I won't accept it, Salma. This baby must leave this house. You want to keep me away from my child? I spoke to a friend about an orphanage in Maiduguri. They'll accept him there. Father, what offense has this innocent child committed? Even if you hate his father, you still love his mother. My blood flows through his veins. You can never be separated from this child's father. Mother, I will not give my child away. Greetings. Please, we're looking for Salma. Salma... Salma, one of the abducted girls. OK, I don't know... But, one of them lives here. I'll get her for you. OK. Thank you. Some people are looking for you. Looking for me? Yes, they are outside. All right, let's go. I don't know if you know them. Goni! Bulus! Daddy Salma. Hold it right there. Don't you dare come close to me with that child. Daddy Salma, please calm down. Why should I calm down? You are asking me to calm down after a rascal has brought shame upon me. Good day, Father. - Daliya. - Daliya. Good day, Mother. Who are these people? They're... They're who? -Salma? - Are you? No, Baba. What are you looking for? Please, Father. We are looking for Salma. Looking for who? Salma? After ruining her life out there, you still follow her home? It's not the way it looks, Baba. Calm down, Baba Salma. Baba Salma! - Baba! - What is it? He is the father of my child! He saved me! This rascal destroyed you. Salma! Oh, my God. - Iliya, don't do this. - God forgive me. Today, heads will roll. - Iliya. Listen to me... - Baba! Daliya, you have to go after them. Tell them to leave town immediately. Salma, what have you done? Mother, he'll kill them. He is going to kill them. Finally! Chief, I have been looking for you. Mr. Iliya. Do you know those terrorists are in town? You mean it? They are. They were even at my house. Really? We have to go after them now. What are you waiting for? Gather the youths, let's finish them off! -I don't want any of them alive. - Yes. Thank you. I don't want any of them. Thank you. Thank you. Mother, he hasn't returned. I would have killed him. Father! He saved my life! He raped you! He raped you! Didn't he? That's not true! You mean, you allowed him touch you? You allowed that rascal to touch your body, Salma? I must kill him. Then kill what he has planted. Daddy, Salma, this is not the best approach to take. Salma! Mother, let me have my child. Give my child to me! I said, give me my child! Where are you going? Salma! Salma. Salma, come back. Stay back! I said, let me be, Mother! Salma! Salma! Let's go! Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. From God we came, to Him we return. They set him ablaze. Let's go! Let's go! You'll be safe here. Nobody comes here. We used to come here when we were kids. So Bulus is dead. They killed him. He was the only one I had left. What will I do? Please don't make me cry. His race has come to an end. Go in and rest. Thank you, Daliya. Thank you. I have to go now, before they start looking for me. You can go. Daliya! Yes. Please take care of Salma and our child. Take care of our child. Don't worry, I will. Go, get some rest. Thank you, Daliya. Goni! Salma! They killed Bulus? They killed him. Because they have no sympathy, they came straight to my house. This is like a dream. I blame you for this. You should have sent someone to call us. If I had known it's about this, I would have asked my boys to finish them. This is so surprising. Daddy Salma. We've searched for Salma everywhere in this village. Salma is nowhere to be found. You caused this. You threatened to kill her child. Why wouldn't she run away? Why shouldn't I threaten her? I would have killed her and the child. Do you understand? That child she's talking about is the one that has brought darkness into this house. That's it. There's nothing more to do, let's waste no time. Wherever they are, we must look for them and kill them. That's what we are going to do. That's right, let's go. Let's go. We will get them all. We are going to kill them. Where are the youths of this village? Are you here? - Yes! - We are going to look for them. They are the ones killing our wives, raping our daughters. It is time to look for them. -What are we going to do when we see them? - Kill them! -What are we going to do? - Kill them! Lead the way, let's find them. Let's go! Salma? Yes. I've been thinking. Maybe we should go to my grandma's village. Maybe my mother will be there. No, Goni, calm down. If at all your grandma's village is... one of those villages, they'll keep looking for you. You are their enemy, they will kill you. You can't take the risk. You know they'll never allow us to live our life. Goni, if we're together, then we will live. Daliya! I thought I told you not to come here. They may follow you here. They are on their way. They're coming after you. Someone is peeking! You have to run! Peace be unto you. Who are you? It's me, Lamido. Lamido? What is it? What happened to you? Why do you look this way? There's no time for this. I want you and Salma to tell everyone to move out of this village. Have you people launched an attack? Please, Lamido, don't let them do this evil. I'm not ordering anyone to do so. I'm doing it myself. Let everyone move out of this village. La-- Lamido! I have to go after him. Did you see his eyes? No one can stop him. I have to try. Goni, look at me. There's nothing you can do to stop him. He will kill you. Then so be it. Goni, please don't go there. Banza hates you. I know. Remember in the past, you were ready to die for those girls in the bush. So now why won't you let me help your people? You said "in the past", but now, I can't bring up my child without his father. I really have to go after him. Don't worry. I love you both more than anything in this world. Let me go. I'm sorry. Goni! Lamido! Lamido! Go back! Lamido, wait. Listen to me. Please listen to me. Lamido, wait. Hear me out. Go back, I said! Lamido! Lamido, wait and hear me out. Lamido, there's no gain in what you're about to do. Lamido, everything will be fine. Please listen to me. Lamido, please, you don't have to do this. Goni! There's nothing you can do to save all these people. Nothing! Even if you try to stop me, Banza and the rest are on their way. I know. But there's something I can do to save you. Lamido, remember your mother. Remember Suleiman, remember Vila. Quiet! My mother and my sister are dead. Dead! Look around you, Goni. These people can follow you here just to kill you. Nobody understands that we're destined to die. That's how we were deprived of our happiness. They turned us into what we are today.
