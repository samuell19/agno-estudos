Look at your mask working. Now I want to read you something I wrote: "Isolation in a chamber where external communication is impossible because the atmosphere is deadly, in a chamber where it is necessary to wear a mask to survive, is very reminiscent of the living conditions of modern man." I don't want to design more of these "...one can't reflect on this mythical one dimensional man without, unfortunately, analyzing all the characteristics of our industrial society. But an effective metaphor could be very attractive, clarifying extreme consequences which are not explicitly mentioned; Which remain implicit." "For example, doesn't the fact of being forced to wear a mask create a sense of anguish? The introjection of these obsessive, hallucinatory needs does not produce an adaption to reality, but mimesis, standardization: The cancellation of individuality. The individual transfers the outside world inside. There is an immediate identification of individuals in society as a single entity. The needs of physical survival are met by industrial production, which now proposes as very necessary, the need to relax, to enjoy oneself, to behave and consume according to advertising models, which precisely illustrate the desires everyone can experience. The cinema, radio, television, press, advertising and any other good service of industrial production, is no longer directed towards different destinations." No, this sentence isn't clear. "The cinema, the radio..." Excuse me. I already saw them, they're very entertaining I'll look at them tonight. In these conditions of uniformity, the old alienation becomes impossible when individuals identify with an imposed life-style and experience self gratification and satisfaction, anyone subject to alienation gets swallowed up by his existence.
