"And this court believes that under the circumstances of the case- " ",..viciously and deliberately assaulted me, "he said. "I was left for dead with a .25-caliber bullet... "lodged in my head about one inch from my spinal cord. "As a result of this violent act... -my life has completely changed. " You got something in your head you want out? Because if you move your head one more time, you ain't gonna have to worry about it... 'cause I'm gonna kick that right off the top of your goddamn head. You understand that? See, I don't like nothin' in the first place. And I don't like you. When you wake up in the morning, do you think... that maybe I'll have to kill somebody today? Is that paranoia? Yeah? For you it's paranoia. For me it's a reality. I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up at the boat. There was a lot of fish today. Did you miss Mommy? No. Did you have fun at school today? Nicole, I'm sorry I'm late. I really am. Why don't we go home? I got us a nice, big cod for dinner tonight, okay? If you don't put that stick down - Listen to me. I'm gonna hurt you. Do you hear me? - I'm gonna tell your father! -Tell your father! - No, don't! And from motherfuckin' now on- Now, who know what "now on"means? "From now on. "Somebody tell me. Forever, till the day I die. You can only make one mistake and you're done. You understand? I hear so many motherfuckin' bells... that when they don't ring, I still hear 'em ring. Look at me, motherfucker, when I'm talking. A tough guy. You got that? And then what do you think's gonna happen? Keep that in your mind. Because every one of us have family out there. - Will she like it? - It's broken. You still aren't taking care of yourself. Do you want something to eat? - Are you hungry? - No. Go ahead. - Do you need some help? - What? - Listen to me. Sit down. I don't think I can live through another summer like this. It's so unusual. Next year it won't be so bad. Just stink. Have to put up with it, I guess. - Can't say that I really like it though. - Where's Nicole? Where's Nicole? Why don't you go up to your room and take a nap? You really could use some rest. Hello? Peter's here. What? - Take another one here. Her clothes are clean. There's no blood anywhere. No sign of resistance. Her hands and nails are clean. Jesus Christ. Let's get her to the examiner in Lameque. Motel Flagg, Marvin speaking. Marvin. McNally. When did you discover the body? Man, I already talked to the cops about this. Okay. It was late in the morning, around 11:00 or so. I was painting the side of the building, and I smelled this really bad smell. So I went over to the bushes and there she was... - lying there, rotting away. I couldn't even finish painting it stank so much. How long had she been there anyway? Hello? Hello? I don't know. I guess you noticed. I'm a mess. Supper's at 7:00. I won't wait. You can get your own breakfast. It's $10 every day. Don't make a lot of noise. - Winds will increase tonight.

A deepening low will produce winds to 40 miles an hour. - Do you want tea? - Yes. You can't stay in the house all day. It's not healthy. You have to get outside, make an effort. They're killing people out there. Listen to me. Don't think about anything else when I'm talking to you. Just listen. It's not healthy to sit inside all day and not do anything. You've got to do something. Do you understand? I'm, uh - I'm leaving. I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me. But I understand. You're right. It's all up to me. I don't have much money. I can send you what I owe you, all right? I will. I-I'll send it. I mean, is that okay? It's okay, right? Ma? Did he say where he was going? He took his belongings? Do you really think he's gone for good? Did he say anything about Nicole? - Okay. See you then. I found only a slight trace of blood on her clothing. This indicates that she was killed naked... and then redressed after the blood flow ceased. The majority of damage was centered on the upper-left thorax. A wooden object produced multiple costal fractures... and a rupture of her left diaphragm. You can see the extensive splintering. I also found evidence of traumatic hemothorax and pulmonary contusions. Massive internal bleeding caused her to suffocate. I can't do this now. Yeah, you haven't seen nothing. Club soda. Your granddaughter? Yeah. - Give me the fuckin' money. You see the fuckin' money in the cash register? Give it to me now! Hurry up, old man! Put your fuckin' head down, motherfucker, and keep it down! Come on, man! Fuck! Give me the fucking cash! You wanna die too? Well, what are you lookin' at? I'll blow you away too, you little shit! You gonna do something about that? Why not? Well, do something about it. All you gotta do is get up and go through me to get him. There have been reports of a man on the island following your daughter. I'd like to place Nicole under police observation. No, I don't want that. The man is Peter Winter, Nicole's real father. I know he was staying at the harbor with his mother, Gladys Winter... but he left her house yesterday. The girl needs a father. Would you have dinner with me tonight? - I live near the harbor, off- - I know. I'm not a cop. I'm a detective. Come on, come on, I see you. Come on. Fuck! Come on. - Come on. No fucking way. You never hit me, man. Never, never. Let's go, let's go. Come on! Never. No fucking away. I'm too fucking good. Let's go. Come on! Come on! - Come on. I see you. Get the fuck down here. Come on. Turn around. Come on. I see you. Turn around. Turn around! I see you! Come on! You can't. Turn around. Come on. I see you. Turn around. Come on. Turn around. Just turn around. You can't hide from me. You can't hide from me. Come on. You can't hide from me. Just turn around. Just turn around. You can't hide from me. You can't hide from me. Just turn around. Just turn around. Just turn around. You hear me? You hear me? You can't hide from me. You can't hide from me. This is when he was a baby. Just slept in his crib all day. Could go about our work. This is right after we moved to Miscou. He wasn't allowed to have a dog of his own, so we went down the road to Mr. Miller's. Played with his dog. Think his name was Dash. Spent all day long with that dog. Dog died. We said he could have a pet ofhis own, but he wasn't interested after that. He finished at the top five percent of his class. Then he went to Bathurst to college the next year. To study science. But he dropped out right at the beginning. We didn't know. He didn't want to be with us. So he ended up on a boat off of Gasp?. I think he was having difficulties. Here he is when he thought he'd gained too much weight... needed to go on a diet. He lost 20 pounds in under a month, and he went from looking like this... to looking like this. Not a healthy look. Just didn't look like him. He gained a little of the weight back, but not enough. He doesn't look like himself. My husband made all those pictures. He was a good man. He took care of his family. Do you have any idea where your son might have gone? He came to see his daughter, and when she didn't show up, he left. Why did you put Nicole up for adoption? Do you know what it's like to see your son deteriorate? When he was growing up, he was a quiet boy, but he was happy. And then all of a sudden he changed. I won't have that same thing happen to her. The library is closed. The library is closed. You'll have to leave. Tomorrow will be dry as high pressure holds over the upper Atlantic coast. Winds from the east will increase overnight. - What about the blood and the hair? No trace of either on the body. And the cigarette? No saliva. I see. You are going to examine the body again? Good. Good. Hello. - Dr. Michaels. Hello! - Grace Vibert? - Yes. Detective McNally. I'm in charge of the Jennifer Apel case. I'd like to ask you a few questions if you have a minute. - Yes? - You were Jennifer's teacher at the time of her death? - Yes. I was. - She was eight. - That puts her in third grade. - Second. Did you notice any change in her attitude or behavior before her death? No. Nothing. Can I help you? I'm looking for my daughter. Her name is Nicole Winter. Y-You put her up for adoption. You -You put her up for adoption. - I can't help you. Well, do something about it. All you gotta do is get up and go through me to get him. I regret every fuckin' day I been here. You'd have to be a fuckin' fool not to take it. - I wouldn't be here. - This ain't no playground! We play for keeps in here. And I'll kill you. He was in the library, and he came up behind me... and he just frightened me to death. - I'm so glad you're here. - Did he do anything to you? Well, he didn't really do anything, but he made me think... that he was going to do something bad to me. - I see. - So, are you going to protect us? - Are you going to be here? I mean - - Oh, yes. I'll be here for a while. Quite a while. And what do you think? I mean, is - Are we safe? Well, let me take your name. - You live in the, uh, town. - I'm the librarian. - Okay. - Well, you could - I'll give you my address. You could come over later, and we could talk more about it perhaps. *Little lamb, little lamb, little lamb * *Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was ** Hi, Gladys. I'm sorry we're late. How are you? Give your grandmother a kiss. Go sit right over there. When I was your age, a child wasn't allowed to speak until their elders spoke to them. My, she's becoming a quiet child, isn't she? I guess she has. Haven't you? Nicole. Why doesn't my grandmother like me? Now listen to me. Your grandmother loves you very much. Nicky, we've been through this many times before. Well, why can't I live with her? Your grandmother still wants you to live with her, but she's an older woman now. And besides, now you have me. You're not my mother. I am your mother. My mother is dead. I understand how things work. I know what's going on. I realize that certain people are listening to me now. I understand that- For a long time now. These are difficult times, and you know, that to pull through- The time has come. Hello, Nicole. Who are you? I'm your father. You remember me? No. My name's Peter. Your grandmother Gladys is - i-is my mother. You always play by yourself? Sometimes. Well, maybe- Maybe we could play together. Maybe. Hey. You want to go to the beach? Would you like that? Let's go to the beach, okay? Oh, it doesn't work. You don't have a very nice car. Ready? Yes. You like the radio? - Yes. - What do you like to listen to? I don't know. Is my mother really dead? Yes. What was she like? She was - She wasn't like anyone else. She was different. Uh - Really different. There's a lot of people out there who... want to hurt you. And -W-Wherever- Wherever you are. She was good. How about some breakfast? Hungry? Yes. Move over, sweetie. That's where I've been while you've been growing up. I was in a - in a hospital bed, and I had been operated on. And they had put a - a small receiver in the back of my head and a transmitter in my finger. Know what they are? - A radio? - Yeah. Radio. Anyway, to get at the - the transmitter, I had to take my fingernail off. How would you do that? How did I take it off? I - I feel better. I can - I think clearer. But I still have to get the receiver out of my head. If I could just slow down a little bit... I know I could come up with a solution. Stop! Freeze! Police! Nicole. Nicole. It's okay. It doesn't hurt. You're gonna- You're gonna be all right. There's no pain. Just try to move a little. Just move a little, baby. Daddy's here. Please. Just leave me alone! I'm not gonna - listening to you! I'm clean. It's out of my mind. Absolutely buddy-buddy... with Mr. Beefeater and Mr. Tanqueray. I'm continuing. Have patience. - Come on. Start from the beginning. - I just started. This indicates that she was killed naked and then re-dressed- Conclusive? Inconclusive. Come on. Buy me another drink. He was the scariest person I've ever seen. He had dirty pictures all over his car. Nicole. -Just try to move a little. -Just move a little, baby. What are you looking at? I'll blow you away too, you little shit! - You sound like a fuckin' broken record. - You're full of shit. What do I have to do? - Hello. Hello. Daddy, are you there? - Hello. Hello. Daddy, are you there? - Hello. - Daddy, are you there? - Hello.
