THE RADIO AMATEUR Víctor. Do you know anything about my days off? Sorry, I was out of coverage. Yes, what is it? Do you want me to serve you? No, no. Thank you, Raquel. How are things at work? Have they given you the contract? No, not yet. I'll have to end up calling Social Affairs myself and fix it. I can fix my own things. No, no, you can't. What do you say? Thank you God for this meal and for your blessing. Amen. Your mother would be so proud of you. She never prayed. Do you want anything? Yes. Come in. Come in, come in. Do you know about boats? I need someone to take me here. I don't see it from here. Can you give it to me? You're not from around, are you? No. I come from one of the largest neighbourhoods in Europe. Vallecas. We have very large green areas, but... the bad thing is that the unemployment rate doubles that of Madrid. So... Take it. Take it. I'm sorry, it's late and I have to go now. So... I am a radio amateur, I have one of the biggest VHF antennas in the neighbourhood on the roof of my building. I like listening to the sailors and to the boats, and I think your forecast is pretty good. I have to go, I really don't have time. Can I make a phone call? No, no. Not from here. There's a phone box right at the end of that slope. One of the few that are still working, but... You can call anywhere you want from there. OK. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye, Ane. Hey! Have we met before? Yes. What was your name? I haven't told you yet. Niko. Nikolas? Yes. Nikolas, we went to school together. Damn, man. Niko. Of course. I didn't recognize you, dammit! I didn't realize it was you! Give me a hug, man. Fuck, Niko. It's been such a long time. Damn, man. It's incredible. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you. What are you doing here? How are you? Are you OK? Yes. I'm pretty good. - Really? - Yes. Man, I'm glad. I'm not sure what you need, but listen. You can go over there, to the little blue houses. - Do you see them? - Yes. There's a guy who works there named Lupo. He's a little bit of an asshole, but he can give you a hand, OK? Will you stay around for a few days? - Yes. - Well, see you then. Go and tell him you're my friend. I'm sure he'll help you, OK? - OK. - Bye, Niko. It's good to see you. You have contacted TODOPARK parking and services. If you want to speak to the mobile payment service press 1, parking reservations 2, car wash service 3, if you know the extension press 0. If not, wait to be attended by the operator, please. Dial the extension number. Dial the extension number. OK, bye. What were you doing last night walking near the shop? Be careful. I'm Lupo. Niko. Ane told me you could help me, even if you are a bit of an asshole. And tell me, Niko. How can I help you? I have to get here. I have two days off and then two days of holidays. I have till Tuesday afternoon, when I have to work. One minute. Dad! What? Before Tuesday this guy has to get to the continental shelf. Well, that? Is not that easy. There are not that many boats that will carry you so far and so fast. And besides, they consume a lot of diesel. Do you have money? I need an 8-metre boat with a cabin that can be dispatched about 50 miles. I have to carry my mother. Your mother? Yes. She's here with me. That's not even enough to start the engine. And I would need it to have emergency equipment as well. Flares and a lifeboat. That's enough. What is your job? I'm an upholstery-cleaning specialist. We upholster, fix, restore... We also polish and remove bad smells. Look, I can take you on my yacht. I'll make you a deal. There is a lot work at the pier and not that many competent people. Could you repair a boat in two days? Yes, I can repair it in two days. OK, great. If you do it, I'll take you. Dad, can we talk? He can't work here. We should call someone first. He seems to have a problem, he's kind of limited. Does he have a problem? I have a problem with your useless friends, who don't finish the boat I've already sold. He starts today. Call Ane and tell her to explain how it all works. What's your problem? Are you deaf? Get your asses off the ground, come on! This goes on all day long. I'm sick of you! All of you come here. What's up, you fucking slackers? No work today? Don't make a mess. Niko is going to work on the boat at the back, OK? Javier hired him, so... Prepare everything, he starts working today. Niko, come here. Look... Come in. Come on, I'll explain. There it is, a little more to the left. It's done. Ready. It's fixed. Well, dude, there you have the crown jewel. Good luck with it. Let's see that boat. He told me... Well, I am not saying it. I am not saying it. Remind him we are friends, yeah? Don't touch me. You touch me a lot. I think so. You're a bit of a queer. All day here, he is getting confused. And what's up with this guy. Niko! What is his name? Nikola, Nikolas? Niko! What's your name? Nikola or Nikolas? - Nikolas. - Nikolas. Come here with us. Yes, come with us, dude. You've worked a lot. You've been working all day long and a break won't hurt you. - Let him sit down, dude. - A beer? - Here it is. - Let him sit down, man. Sit here. Sit down, Niko. Why do you carry those headphones around? To be more focused. And is it working for you? Yes. - Cool. - We should have some too. Tell your dad, we would be more productive. And what's wrong with you guys? All day laying around. What are you guys doing later? Why don't we go to the skatepark? Yes, man. But now we can't skate. I think we should. Are you going home now? We are going to go near here to drink something. But we are not staying too late. Last night... No, no. Guys, do you want to go for a drink then? Cool. - OK. - Perfect. We've been working all day. Is Niko coming or not? - Niko, come with us. - Niko, are you coming? - Where? - For a drink. It's nearby. Drink what? Beer, wine... Whatever you want. You have to relax. Are you coming? OK. Great, let's go. Let's go. Come on, go. Go, go. Stop. Don't touch the wheelchair. You are being annoying. Come on, Niko. I'm coming with you. You've worked hard today. Do you like repairing boats? Yes, I like it. I work cleaning. What do you clean? Cars, vans… You're pretty good. We upholster and repair. In Vallecas, there is a place like this. In Vallecas? - Yes - Like this? Yes. There is a tree out of the city. When I would get nervous my mum used to carry me there. Hey, Niko. What? Do you remember when you called me ugly? Yes. - Really? You do? - Yes. At the bus stop. Fuck, that's scarred me for life. I had a yo-yo, my mum bought it for me. And you wanted to play with it. It was new, and I didn't want you to play with. You went crazy. Your poor mum tried to calm you down, but you wouldn't stop. You went on and on. And you said in front of all the girls: Ane is a whore. Is a whore and she is ugly. They have been calling me the 2nd C whore during many years. Niko. Javi told me why you came. And we are helping you out, OK? One day we went to the fair. That day we had to have a good time because my dad wasn't much around, he was always at sea. But I didn't have a good time. Then they argued because of me and shouted at each other. Then we went to the doctor and he told me I was different. But that's not your fault. Anyway different? Different from what? From who? To the doctors who saw you? To the lawyers, to the whores? Who are we different to? I think we're all the same. Some people believe they are the point of reference to what is normal and what is not. That's the people who make us different. Don't you think? My father went out sailing that night, as usual. But... He never came back. Tomorrow I'm taking you to an awesome place, OK? Yes, I think so. I think so? So fucking weird. Yes or no? - Yes. - OK. I'm glad I can help you. One thing. Tomorrow I'll be here when you finish work. Be careful, this is a private club. OK? OK. And... We can get in trouble. OK? Who is at the radio? Over. Hey Luis, Javi Ugalde is here, I have seen you going out. Are you going to fish tuna or you are going closer? We are going... to fish tuna, To see what happens… Over. Ok, ok, we also go out. In 15 to 20 minutes we also sail over there. In which direction are you going? I don't know..., we are on the radio. And if you need anything you contact me. OK Luis, I get out with the Escama. OK? Let's talk later. Out. Do you hear that sound? Niko? Come on! Look, it's over there. Who do you live with now? With my aunt Raquel. Great, now you only spitting all over my face. Do you think they'll come? I don't think so. Well... It would be quite rare for a seagull to come and eat an apple. Here, I feel free. Like seagulls? Like seagulls. Why are you looking at me? What's wrong? You have never seen tits before, have you? Look at me. How is it? General call, general call, general call. Next, weather report, 24-hour forecast for Biscay's coastal waters.

Come on. 1-1, OK? - It's ready. - OK. Be careful. Are you going for the pink one? - Whichever I want. - OK, OK. - I think that one is for you. - Leave me alone, I can't shoot. Niko, come here! What's wrong with this thing? Check the safety. It doesn't work? Hold it tight. Take off your earmuffs. I think Ane likes you. Why don't you go and kiss her? Look at her.
