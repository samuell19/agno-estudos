[haunting music] If you think about something bad, and even though you don't do anything about it, it's a sin. You're a sinner. [lighter clicking] Just as if you did something. So you might as well do it. My brother Al, he's a priest. THERAPIST: The one who fantasized about the prostitute? Don't you say nothing bad about my brother. Forgive me, Father! You ever been with a prostitute? THERAPIST: [clearing throat] No. You should. They make you feel like a man. THERAPIST: What about Nino? He's my cousin. We grew up together. He's like a brother to me. The three of us were like the Three Musketeers. He's got a big nose, he's got a fat ass. And me, you know, I'm-- I'm in pretty good shape. And I'm-- I would say maybe borderline handsome. But that guy would get all the girls. And he got caught. He got caught by a husband, got caught by his wife. He's a mailman by trade. And he would-- he would deliver everything. Extra special delivery. Eh. Priest. Mailman. That must be true about what they say, that women like men in uniforms. Myself, I'm just a house painter. THERAPIST: What about Geno the house painter? What about me? THERAPIST: What do you like, Geno? GENO: I like guns. THERAPIST: I mean women. What about you and your sister, Sophie? I don't want to talk about that now! THERAPIST: OK. Let's talk about the neighborhood. [sighing] After my folks died, we got robbed. You know what that's like? Did you ever get robbed? You got a feeling like-- like you're violated. I mean, you got strange people walking around your house. They're-- they're touching things that-- that don't mean anything to anybody, but they're very personal to you. Then the kids-- the kids are stealing the gold from the altar in the church. They gotta lock up the church. But the last straw was when they attacked my sister. Those bastards are lucky to be alive. The neighborhood is dying. We have to save it. Come on, come on. How much you want? Hey, man, just enough to get me off. What's this shit? What does this look like, a nickel and dime operation? All right, all right, give us half. It'll be 25 now and 25 on Tuesday. What do I look like, a bank? Forget it! Hey, man-- [tires screeching] Shit! [shouting] Don't you ever buy from him again! Do you understand that? I swear to god, I'm gonna stick my foot up your ass! You got it? [tires screeching] Geno! Geno! Geno! [gunshots] Get back here, you son of a bitch! [gunshot] [gunshot] Geno! Geno! [shouting] Gimme that thing! [suspenseful music] [explosions] Al, are you all right? Al! Come on, let's go! Hurry up, get him in that car. Come on! [sirens blaring] What the hell is wrong with you? What? You know damn well what. What? You can be such an asshole, Geno. That's it, Geno. I don't want any part of this anymore. It's over, I quit. It's wrong. We can't stop now. The neighborhood's getting safe again. We're making a difference. I don't know that we're making a difference. Pop would have wanted it this way. Geno, leave him out of this. - Al's right. - Oh! What is the matter with you guys? Look around. Any police cars? You're lucky if you see one in the daytime, maybe. God, don't you read the papers? They cut the police department back by 10%. They didn't add, they cut back. We're the ones who got the pushers out of the schoolyards. Not the cops. We did. God, if we don't take care of ourselves, we might as well put a torch to it. I think Geno's right. I just don't want people getting hurt. Well, Al's right. If we can't get our message across without hurting people-- Sometimes that's the only thing they understand. Geno's right. All right, Geno. But no killing. If we kill, we're no better than them. [banging fist] [music playing] [thunder crashing] What's for dinner? I made your favorite, meatloaf and potatoes and carrots. I made your favorite, meatloaf, potatoes, and carrots. You think that's the answer to everything. I hate that! Hey, come on. Come on, loosen up here, come on. Hey, come on. Thank god it's Friday. Let's have a good time. Have a drink, eh? Hey, Anthony. Anthony. I don't want a drink, Jerry. What can I get you? I don't want anything, thanks. Set the lady up, whatever she wants. What'll it be? Uh, nothing, thank you. (MOCKINGLY) Nothing, thank you. Anthony, I'll have another one. Look, if you're not gonna drink, then what the hell are you doing in a bar? Jerry, I need $50. For what? Like I was telling you, the water was cut off this morning, all right? I called the water and power company. They told me that the bill's been past due for three months, Jerry. They need a payment-- - Tomorrow, tomorrow. --so they can turn the water-- Hey, I'll take care of it tomorrow, OK? - No, Jerry-- - Come on, have a drink. Anthony! Anthony! They're closed tomorrow. If I don't get down there-- Yeah, Jerry. --in 15 minutes, we're gonna have to wait until Monday. Set her up with a drink and give me another one too, please. You haven't finished that one yet. Hey, if I ask you for a drink-- gimme a drink if I ask you for it. Come on. Yeah, eh, and hurry up about it, huh? What are you doing? Jerry, I gotta pay the water bill. Are you trying to steal my money? My money I sweat for 50 stories above the ground? I'm not stealing it, all right? It's for us. I've got your clothes to wash. There's dishes in the sink. Don't you want to take-- Jerry. You're hurting my wrist, Jerry. Hey, hey. Don't you ever, ever try and steal my hard-earned money. You want money, you come to me and ask for it, OK? You want money? Hey, here. Take the money! I hate when you get like this. Oh, really? You hate when I get like this? Hey, well why don't I give you something to really hate me about, huh? Take this! [church bell ringing] He's a good man, Father. I mean, I know that we're not financially in a great position right now. - But who is these days, Father. We do our best. JERRY: And sometimes better than that. MARY: Really, it's-- it's not the money. JERRY: It's not the money, Father, at all. There's this problem that-- See, I have this problem, Father, but I love-- I love her so much-- He loves me, I know that. Honey, I know you love me. It's just that sometimes, you know, that-- sometimes it's not always enough. What-- wait. It was enough for my parents. Jerry, those weren't-- those weren't parents, those were watchdogs. - Hey. May they rest in peace. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Don't call my parents animals. Don't call them animals. I didn't call them animals. See? You don't listen to me, Jerry. JERRY: I heard you. You said they were watchdogs. I said watchdogs. I know what I said, Jerry. Father-- Father, you heard her. She called my parents watchdogs. Now, come on. Intervene here, Father. Pick a side. Uh, Jerry, I'm not here to take sides. I'm only here to, uh-- to help people see, to clarify things. Do you understand? Yeah. Now tell her I'm right. Well, I can only interpret what I heard. Now, Mary, you did, you called his parents watchdogs. See? He heard you. Yeah, but-- but, Jerry, that doesn't necessarily mean that, um-- that your parents are dogs. It could also, uh, mean that they, uh-- they watched dogs. You saying me? I-- I didn't say it, Jerry. I'm-- I'm only making an observation. Father, you calling me an animal? You say that I'm an animal? Now-- well-- hey-- well-- hey-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got angry. It's just the-- Well, good, good. Um-- well look, it's getting a little bit late. Could we continue this, uh, next time? But what about Jerry's problem? Uh-- yeah. Well, what is it, Jerry? Well, Father, sometimes he goes-- Uh, please, Mary. MARY: Oh, I'm sorry. Jerry. You see, Father-- well, it's my temper, Father. It's my temper. Your temper? Jerry, I think we've already established that. Well, it-- it's my drinking too. It's my drinking, and my temper, and, uh-- and my fists, Father. - Hey, Al. - Geno. Uh, come on in. This is, uh, my brother Geno. This is Mary and Jerry. How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you, all good. Well, uh, it ls getting kind of late and I have a mass to say, so if we can continue this next time. Sure. But Father, I was just starting to open up. Jerry, it's OK. Thank you, Mary, thank you. I appreciate that. Sure. Bye. Take care and, uh, I'll speak to you next time. - OK. - OK. Thanks a lot. GENO: You better watch out, Al. Why? You say the wrong thing to this guy Jerry, he's gonna whack you in the head. Did you get a look at that shiner on her? A blind man could see that. And you're not much help. Heard a lot about you lately, all good? What? Stop being a troublemaker. I'm telling you, every time I see those two, it gets worse and worse. First it's a bloody lip, then a fat lip, then a black eye, then two black eyes. God knows what's next. Broken arm, dislocated shoulder. - Geno, please. - What? That is the natural progression of events in people like that. That's gonna keep on till either she leaves him or she kills him. All right, how's the counseling going? If I talk to him from now till eternity, he'd still beat the hell out of her. See? You know what the guy needs? Guy needs a beating. You oughta just kick his ass. Give him a little of his own medicine. You know something? For once, you might be right. I know I'm right. Eye for an eye. [suspenseful music] [water running] [door thudding] Yo, Sophie, I'm back. Uh, where are the new deck of cards I bought? In your bedroom on the dresser. Uh, I'm gonna go get changed and go to the club. Be back in a couple hours. OK. And make sure you eat something. [music playing] [chuckling] JERRY: Geno. Cheating these guys? GENO: No. Come on, have a seat. Two for a draw. I never played this game. Join the club. These guys just got off the boat and they're taking me for every cent I got. Somebody should tear that broad's arm off and shove that torch up her ass. If it wasn't for that broad, we wouldn't be sitting here right now. Right. And I wouldn't be into these guys for 150 bucks, right? [laughing] All right, you in or out? Uh, gimme $20. Can I have all white? They're all worth the same. I know, but you know I feel lucky when they all match. - Are you happy? - Yes. Good. Ante up. I'll check. Check-a. Listen, those guys that stole Mrs. Tinelli's television set. The hold up-- Geno, please. Later when we're alone, OK? Don't worry. I'm worried. Your mother's a fucking whore, right? Bust! See? Don't worry. All right, I am in. Yeah, I'll see more cards. Four-a and four-a. Four! For three hours I've been trying to get the stakes up to three and six. But all these guys know is check, two, four, raise. BOTH: Raise? No, not yet. So what'd you come up with? It's an old apartment, small apartment, filled with hot stuff. I mean, there's TVs, radios, small boxes, big boxes. The place looks like a pawnbroker's warehouse. All right, how many cards? - Three. - Two-a? Four-a. Dealer takes one. How many guys? Three. To you, Al. Check. Check-a. Four. In the back. Four and four. [laughs] I'm out. All right, that's eight to the check. Capisce? Four and four. Four-a, and four-a, and four-a, and four-a! Four-a, and four, and four. What'd they do? [laughing] I don't know, Geno, but I think they just raised you to 16. I'll never learn. I mean, all day long it was check and raise. Check and raise! Once a sucker, always a sucker. All right, look. I call, OK? Three kings. Stugots, you got a little bit of everything, but nothing matches. How about you? I gave you four cards. Now he got four cards, look at this. He's got a flush. [laughing] Oh. Hey. You're scum. You're both scum. - Grazie. You know. Piss on you and your bleeding hearts, OK? Grazie, grazie. I need a drink. Grazie, grazie. BOTH: Check and raise. Check and raise. Check and raise. Check and raise. You get everything we need? Don't worry. I'm all set. What about Nino? I'll swing by and pick him up later. He's having some, uh, difficulties with his wife. They're having problems? Nah, it's just a lover's quarrel. I told him to stay home, iron things out. Put it down! You gotta believe me! There isn't anyone! If I find those blonde hairs on your jacket one more time, Nino, I'm gonna take this iron and I'm gonna stick it in your eye when you're sleeping at night! Don't threaten me! Nobody threatens me in my own house! [shattering] [dog barking] You son of a bitch! My mother gave us that lamp! You bastard! [shattering] Come on, kill me! You want to kill me? Come on and kill me! Kill me! [banging] MAN: Kill him, for Christ's sake, so I can get to sleep! Ah, shut up! We know you're listening! Yeah! You take your ear off that floor and you stop listening! MAN: What are you gonna do about it if I don't? I'm gonna put a bullet in your fucking ear someday! Someday! Someday, someday, Nino is gonna make us uncles. You know, Geno, the proudest moment in my life as a priest is when I married those two. Ooh. What a day that was. Frannie and Nino. God, they were so innocent. Ugh. Harder, dammit. Again? Yes, Nino, harder. Ugh. Harder! I'm afraid to hurt you. Just harder, dammit! Yeah. Yeah. Yes. OK, now pull. Yes! Harder! Pull! Pull! Oh! Harder! Pull! Pull! Oh, yes, that's it! That's it! That's it! Get on! That's it! That was it! Oh, that was it! Oh, yes! That was it! - Gah! [television playing] FRANCES: Oh, harder! Harder! Oh, yes! Nino, yes! Oh! Oh! [panting] [moaning] I'm coming! I'm coming! [panting] Yes! Yes! I guess they worked out their differences, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Should I? - Uh, no. Uh, wait. [panting] [moaning] I'm coming! - I'm coming! - I'm coming! Ah! Ah! I'm coming! I'm coming! Ah! Ah, I'm coming! [moaning] Yes! Yes! [yelling] I'm coming! I'm coming! - I'm coming! I'm coming! [moaning] ANNOUNCER (ON TV): A 49-year-old unidentified man went berserk last night, opening fire-- - Come on, Geno. Let's just come back later, OK? What, and miss the rest of the show? Come on. [knocking] ANNOUNCER (ON TV): --all are dead, including three children who all suffered serious-- Hey, what took you guys so long? That's what I was gonna ask you. FRANCES: Hey! Is that Geno? Yeah! [laughing] Hi, how you doing? How you doing? Hello there, Father Al. Fix yourself, will you? Come on, lighten up. It's just your cousins. Well, one of them's a priest. Have some respect. Sorry, Father Al. That's quite all right, Frances. You see, it's how we come into the world. Sort of. - Yeah. Hmm. What time are you coming home? I don't know. Yeah. Well, give me a kiss. I already gave you one. So give me another one. Now! Uh, listen, why don't we just wait down the hall, OK? I'll see you. [suspenseful music] AL: Geno, I told you no more guns. Don't worry. they're not loaded. It's just to scare them. AL: I still don't like it. So here, you take the crowbar. NINO: I think Al's right. [tv playing] [knocking] MAN: Que quieren? Television set? [speaking spanish] Se or Hector. Mi hermano. Hey, loco, yo no conozco a ning n Se or Hector. (WHISPERING) He knows you. He knows you. Mira. No te puedo ayudar. Try Carlos. Every Puerto Rican knows a Carlos. [knocking] How about Hector's cousin, Carlos? MAN: Mira, puerco! Yo no conozco a ning n Carlos. Fuck you, man! Fucking store is closed! You know. you just can't be nice anymore. Ah! You again? Where's the old lady's television? Fuck you, man. I don't know what you're talking about. [gunshots] What the hell's the matter with you? What? Geno, you can be such an asshole! - What? - You know damn well what. Come on, I didn't hit anybody. All right, where is it? Estan locos! [speaking spanish] What? What did he say? What did he say! You guys are crazy. There's a small black one. Take it. Take anything you want. [church bells ringing] [organ music] How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? [laughing] No, that isn't it. Ah-- Oh. [clearing throat] Good morning. Hello. [woman laughing] Whether you begin with hello or good morning, I'll listen to you. [suspenseful music] I need your help. You know I'm trying to leave my life behind me. I thought I was making progress with you. AL: You are. WOMAN: How could you just pass me on to somebody else like that? AL: Father Mike was very competent in these matters. WOMAN: And you're not? AL: I definitely think you should seek guidance-- WOMAN: Are you ashamed to be seen with me? AL: No. WOMAN: Is that it? AL: No. WOMAN: I can't live like this anymore. When I was little, my mother said you could tell a priest anything. AL: Not this priest. Not for you. I need you to help me. Please go. It has been two months since my last confession. I cut him with a knife. I burned my baby. He wouldn't give me the money. She wouldn't stop crying. I'm homosexual. I want to be a man. God says we should be with our own kind. Jesus was a man. My mom beats me. My father touches me. I like it. I hate it. I want to sleep with my mom. I want to kill my father. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Is that the answer? You sit in a dark box and ask for forgiveness. And then, poof. Just like magic, your sins are gone. And now you're all forgiven. THERAPIST: Forgiveness begins with yourself. It was just a normal day, like any other day. I was painting a-- apartment on the west side. And I came home for lunch, like I always came home. That was the day all my troubles began. Did you paint indoors or outdoors today? Please, Sophie, I'm eating. You know, the weather is supposed to be beautiful tomorrow. Why don't we take a picnic up to the lake? I can't. I gotta work. You go. Well, Mama never went to the lake by herself. I'm your brother, I'm not your husband. I just meant they never went alone. That's all I meant! What's the matter? What happened? - Nothing happened. Nothing ever happens. GENO: Why are you talking crazy? You know, you say I'm not your wife, yet I cook for you, I clean the house, I wash your clothes. You live here too. Yeah, but I never have any time to do anything. I never have anyone to do anything with. I'll call Johnny and Jimmy at the club. They'll take you to the lake. [laughing] They don't even speak English! What am I supposed to do, say check and raise all day? GENO: You teach them. No thank you. I'll call Cousin Nino. No! GENO: Why? He's not doing anything anyway. Nino's married! He'll take you there, you do some fishing. You bring back the fish, we cook it, we have it for dinner. Nino's married! GENO: So? That's good. I don't have to worry. Geno, uh, please, don't call Nino. Do you want to go the lake? Then I'm gonna call Nino. And that's it, final. Pass me the pepper. Is this close enough to the lake? Well, I'd like to be closer. Well, if you want to be closer, I'll get you closer. Is this close enough to the lake? Well, I'd like to be closer. Well, if you want to be closer, I'll get you closer. Is this close enough to the lake? Well, I'd like to get a little closer. Well, If you want to get closer, I'll get you closer. Is this close enough to the lake? [music playing] [church bell ringing] I don't understand it, Father. Why do wives call cops? I mean, now I got a record. My boss got a call. They're talking about firing me. No, I love him, Father, OK? If I didn't, I would have left him a long time ago. But I-- I just keep telling him, you know, that this is not good for the kids. Look, Father-- Father-- I know it's not good for the kids. I don't know what it is, Father, but it's just that-- I don't know. You know, when I start drinking and everything, it's just that I-- I become a different person, Father. You know? I really feel that the problem lies mostly with you, Jerry. And I also feel that for the next few meetings that, uh, we should stop these group meetings. I think I would like to see you alone. Hey. Sure, Father. Whatever you say, yeah. OK. Whatever you think is best, Father. Father, forgive me for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? A week ago today. State your sins to God. I have been with a married man, Father. To be with one is not a sin. I have committed adultery, Father. Now, that is a little bit of a problem. I'm here to ask forgiveness, Father. Do you see this happening again? Your silence worries me. Why weren't you at Bruno Camaggio's wedding? What, so I can hear everybody say when are you gonna get married? The only wedding I go to is my own. And how many gray hairs will I have by then? What do you know about any of this? You know how hard it is to find a good woman these days? I mean, after Mom and Sophie, where am I gonna find somebody who's gonna take care of me like that? At a nice Italian wedding, which is why I wanted you to come. I hate the Camaggio family! Enough about me. Look, there's this guy that's pushing drugs over at the 16th street warehouse. I'm gonna go get Nino. I'll meet you at the club this afternoon. Try and get there about, uh, 3:00. - In broad daylight? - Yeah. We show 'em we got balls. I'll see you. [baby crying] FRANCES: You get back in here [inaudible]!! [shattering] NINO: No wonder why my shirts are-- [knocking] [shattering] FRANCES: You motherfucking faggot! Nice mouth. Did she get that from her mother or father? Listen, I can't-- I can't make it today. Why not? It's a little obvious, isn't it? A little problem on the DMZ. What DMZ? The demilitarized zone. I got a war in there. Come on, she never stopped you before. Listen, don't give me a hard time. It's bad enough I get it from her. Is that the only reason you're not going? What do you mean? Of course. [clattering] W-- what do you think it is? I mean, you're not backing out? You're not question what we're doing, are you? [shattering] - No, no. Are you? - No. - No? No. You got 10 seconds to get back in here, Nino, or you're a dead man! [shattering] It sounds serious. Huh! She is. - All right, look. I'm gonna let you slide 'cause you took care of my sister last week. Hey, I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. Five, four-- How long are you gonna be? Two, three hours. --two, one. That's it, Nino! You better feed that thing in there. I ran out of dog food. [shattering] FRANCES: I think it's time we talk. Oh-ho, we can't talk. I gotta go with Geno. We got business. In the middle of the afternoon? Since when? I'll be back in two or three hours, maybe. Yeah, well maybe I won't be here! God doesn't like me that much. [glass shattering] [doorbell ringing] Geno went out. I know. AL: How's Sophie, Geno? Don't ask. AL: What do you mean don't ask? - Don't ask! Hey, she's my sister too. She's always complaining. I never do this, I never do that. She does things for me, I don't do things for her. She acts as if her whole life revolves around me. AL: It does. Don't you start any trouble. She's a person too, you know. So? So sometimes I think you forget that. You treat her like she's the maid or the cook. She's our sister! He's my brother, but I don't tell him everything. Do you want some coffee? No, thank you. I'm so confused. Me too. I know it isn't right. - No, it isn't. - You're married. We're cousins. It isn't right. It isn't. But it is. Yes, it is. But it can't go on. No, it can't. It can't? BOTH: No. No, you're wrong. She's a woman first, and she's our sister second. What are you saying? I'm saying you gotta be nice to her. Make small talk. You gotta ask her questions once in a while instead of giving her orders all the time. Just respect her. I respect her. AL: No, you don't - Yes, I do. - You don't. Yes, I do! I do! I do! AL: All right. You don't wanna listen, I'm not gonna talk. Good. We as people, we have needs, wants, desires-- passions. You mean sex. You mean sex, right? You know, Geno, you could take a Michelangelo and reduce it to a velvet portrait of Elvis. I'm talking about passion. Passion. Sex. It's the same thing. No, you're wrong. Sex is thought out, Geno. But passion-- passion's spontaneous. So it's agreed? It's over. No more, like it never happened. Like it never happened. What the hell do you know about any of this? You're a priest. It's because I'm a priest that I know about these things. Hey, why don't you just stop the counseling. Save that for your nutcases. You know, I hate when you do that. GENO: What? What? You know damn well what. Don't do that. Those people come to me to talk. I do my best. Some of them need professional help, Geno, but I do my best. Take it easy. Take it easy, all right? I didn't mean nothing by it. All right, well just think a little bit before you speak, OK? I hate when you do that! Al, I'm sorry, OK? Look, maybe we oughta cancel this today. You're not backing out, are you? No. Yeah. I don't know. Look, um-- we could be waiting for this guy all day. There's no waiting. The guy's right around the corner. Do you want to go or you want me to go? I'll choose you for it, OK? You call it. [music playing] Excuse me. Can I talk to you a second? So what the hell is this all about? We know you're the guy that's selling the smack to the guy upstairs. And we want him out of the neighborhood. What are you, a fucking cop? Watch your mouth, asshole. He's a fucking priest. Yeah, very funny. Now, what do you guys want? You want a piece of my action. Well, make me an offer. The offer's this. Stay out of our neighborhood! And If I don't, what are you two guys gonna do-- [tires screeching] [shouting] Get him! Come on! Get these bastards. Don't they know who I am? [tires screeching] [gunshots] [music playing] [gunshots] Oh my god! Now they're going backwards! What are you doing? They went over there! Over there! Over there! Shit! [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshots] [tires screeching] Whoa my god! Let's get the hell out of here. Run! Run! Gimme the keys. You drive too slow. Get in. Geno! Al! What are you doing here? I-- I-- I just got here. He just walked in. Just walked in. - Just walked in? - Yeah. - Just in time. - What? For what? Just in time for dinner. [laughing] Hi, Al. Come on. You missed a great one. Did you settle everything? No. Yeah-- what? At home. You know, the DMZ. Oh, yeah. No, no. Not really. Listen, don't worry, 'cause everything works out for the best. How do you know? I know. You know? I don't know, but I know. You don't know? No, nobody knows. But-- but you figure. That's it. I figure. Sophie. Dinner. Geno. What? [clearing throat] If you don't mind. What do you mean, if you don't mind? What do you mean what do I mean? I mean what do you mean? I mean if you don't mind. Oh. Nino, why don't you help set the table. Yeah, sure thing. I'm gonna wash up. Oh, where'd these flowers come from? [clattering] You're lucky that's not my mother's China. Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord. In the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. [opera music playing] So, Al, tell 'em what happened. - What? - Tell 'em. No, Geno. If you want them to know, then you tell them. All right, I will. When we came out of mass, a few blocks away there's this big shootout. - Another shootout? - No one was hurt. No one was hurt? No, not really. I mean, there were a couple of dents in some cars, but everybody went away walking. So, Sophie, how have you been? Fine. Same old, same old. Nothing's different. [clearing throat] Well, Geno. Well what? Oh. OK. So, Sophie, what did you do all day? Can I have the bread, Geno? What'd you do? Can I have the, uh, cheese, Geno? I did the usual. What's the usual? I don't understand. You never ask me what I do all day. Why today? Small talk. What? Father Al told me to make small talk. Would you stop kicking me! Look, it's the truth. Stop being such a pain in the ass and just tell me what you did today. Can I have the wine, Geno? You want a lot of things, don't you? Hey, I don't give a damn what you did today. I'm sorry, Al. I gave it my best shot, OK? [muttering] AL: So, Jerry, uh-- you were supposed to come by last night. You didn't come by. Oh, I know, Father. Listen, I'm really sorry about that. You know, I had-- I had overtime. And, uh, I got home, I was tired. I just-- I just went out, you know? I'm sorry. I should have called you. It was my mistake, I apologize. It's OK. I'm just a little concerned. It's kind of difficult being here and not drinking, isn't it? Well, no, not really, Father. Can I tell you something, Father? Sure. I don't know, it-- it's just that when I come here-- I feel important down here. I got friends here and, you know, I-- I can let all my troubles go. Even if I'm not drinking, I feel like I'm a part of something. I don't know, Father. Maybe I'm crazy or whatever, but, you know, I had so many plans. You know? I had so many plans that-- I wanted to have my own construction company, and-- and we were gonna get a house and everything. And I'm still working for somebody. And every time that I go home and I see my family, I just feel like a failure, Father. You know? Father, why-- why don't dreams come true? How come? I don't have an answer for that, Jerry. [sighing] I didn't think you did. I had a lot of dreams when I was a kid. I wanted to have a family, just like the family I was brought up in. Watching my mother and my father work together. All that love, all that respect. I mean, they complemented each other. That's what I wanted. When Pop died, I don't know. I became the protector. I was the head of the house. I mean, Sophie and I complimented each other. I thought I did the best I could do for her. I never thought you'd show up. Neither did I. We can't go on like this. I must tell Frannie. I gotta leave her. Are you sure? It's the only thing I'm sure of. Promise me something. Anything. Between my father when he was alive and my brother, I've lived my whole life with secrets. I won't live that way anymore. I promise I'll always be true to you. Then tell me you'll stop. I know what you, Al, and Geno do. It's not right. Well, we have to protect what's ours. Let someone else protect the neighborhood. It's dangerous. If you love me, you'll promise to stop. Sophie, you're right. I'll stop. Tonight I'll tell Fran, then tomorrow I'll tell Geno. What do you think she'll say? You motherfucker! You son of a bitch! You piece of shit! Bastard! I can't breathe! Please let go! I can't breathe! You're not supposed to breathe, stupid! Ah! I'm sorry. Frannie, baby, I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't love you. I'm not gonna live the rest of my life with that mistake. You're not gonna live, period. NINO: Frannie, baby, please put the gun down. It's not my fault! Are you blaming me? NINO: No! What did I do? NINO: Nothing. You didn't do anything. What did I do wrong? You didn't do anything wrong. I did so! And you let me tell you! Tell me, please tell me. I'll tell you what I did wrong. Hurry up, tell me. Now I want to know. I did everything, I mean everything you asked me to do! [banging] MAN: You haven't done what I asked you to do. Shut up-- [gunshots] Are you crazy? Yes! [gunshots] Frannie, baby, please put the gun down. I'll give you everything. Give? Give? How bold. All right, then take everything. Everything? How generous of you, Nino. I'm sorry. I was wrong. Oh. You're sorry, so I get to take everything. Take everything. Except you don't have anything for me to take! You didn't have anything when I met you, and now you even have less. [laughing] Give me your balls. What! I want your balls! You can't be serious. Oh, yes I am. Oh, yes I am. I want to hang them from the rear-view mirror of the car that you don't own for me to take! (CRYING) Frannie, please don't. Don't! Don't! Don't! [gun clicking] Shit! Fucking whore! You're a fucking whore! You're a fucking-- - Shut up! - You're a whore! You're a whore! Shut up! I swear to god I'm gonna kill you if you don't shut up! [banging] MAN: That's it, I'm calling the cops! God! You call the cops, I swear to god I'm gonna put a bullet in your ear! Shut up! [yelling] Shut up! Please, shut up. I'm gonna let go. We don't need the cops around here! [gasping] Ugh! Take everything. Can you give me back six years of my life, huh? Can you? I hate you. I've always hated you. Even when I die, I'll hate your guts! Good. It's better that way. I'm gonna spend the night in a hotel. I'll get the rest of my things later. No. No! No, don't go, Nino! Don't go! (CRYING) No, no, no, don't go! So you can put the iron in my eye when I'm sleeping tonight? No. No, I love you. I love you. I still love you. I'll forgive you. Just don't see her again! Come on, let's make love the way we like it, huh? Huh? I got so wet when you almost suffocated me, baby. Huh? It's not the way we like it. It's the way you like it. I can't do it anymore! You need help. And I can't help you. I wish I knew about this before the wedding. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I need help. You know, you're right. I do. Goodbye, Nino. Goodbye. You son of a bitch! Bastard! You mother-- you motherfucker! You son of a bitch! [phone ringing] You bastard! I fucking hate-- I hate you! You bastard! I said I don't want to go home. Don't you understand that? No, I don't understand it, Jerry! Look-- look the kids haven't seen you in over a week, all right? All they're doing is asking for you, OK? I said no! Jerry, don't you think you've had enough? No, I haven't had enough. Have you? OK, OK. Look, just give me the keys, all right? Ugh. I don't want you driving-- Come on, I can drive fine. Stay all night if you want. I just-- I can drive fine. Now, you take a cab, OK? Just take a cab. Hey, Anthony. [coins jangling] Hey-- look, look-- wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. - What? Look, I'm-- I'm sorry. I had a rough day, and I'm sorry. Jerry-- Forgive me? Forgive me? Please forgive me. Pretty please forgive me with a cherry on top. Come on, you forgive me? Oh. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. I mean it, thank you. You got any money? No, Jerry. - Come on, you got any money? - Jerry-- Hey, come on. Hey, don't lie to me. Come on, don't lie to me. OK, yeah. I got some. - Give it to me? No. You don't got any money, you go home. Jerry. Jerry, come on. Now you're hurting me. Jerry-- We're just dancing. Hey, Bill, how you doing? How you doing? We're just dancing! We're just dancing. If you don't give me that money, I am gonna hurt you so bad. Two and two raise. I'll call. [laughing] Geno, we gotta talk. Oh, thank god you're here. Come on, sit down a few hands, all right? My luck is bound to change. Here. Here's some chips. I don't want to play. i want to talk. Just a few hands. All right, I'll only talk if you play. All right? So are you in or out? I'm in. Good. OK. Do you, Nino-- I'm out. You didn't even look at your cards. I don't want to play. I told you I want to talk. Don't you listen? You know, you always do this. You always make people do what they don't want to do just because you want them to do it. You know how annoying that is? You know, you came here with a problem Don't start talking to me about my problems. Time. JIMMY AND JOHNNY: Time. You want to talk, we shall talk. Do you remember the day I took Sophie to the lake? Yeah. Oh, why? You want some money for gas? Is that it? No, I-- I don't want any money. Well, good. Then what is it? We had a real nice time. That's great. It was a beautiful day. We had a picnic. The sun was shining. It was beautiful. What is this, a weather report? Get to the point, OK? Her feet hurt. Her feet hurt? Her feet hurt. And so-- And? So I-- So you what? So I rubbed her feet. You rubbed her feet? I-- I rubbed her feet. And then we had some wine. And then I-- I rubbed her feet some more. And then we had some more wine. And? I couldn't help it. It got very passionate. How passionate? Extremely. You fucked my sister? No, it's not like that at all. Really, it's not like that. You fucked me sister! [yelling in italian] I love her! GENO: She's your cousin! Geno, I love her! GENO: I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! No, Geno, no! [clattering] [shouting] No, no! Geno, please, no! Geno, I love her! Ah! You go near her again, I'll kill you. Ah!

It's all right. No, no, it's all my fault. I'm the one who called Nino. I told Nino to take you to the lake. It's all my fault that he raped you. I'm sorry. Who told you this? Nino, but don't you worry about him. I took care of him. He's never gonna hurt you again. What did he say? I can't repeat it! It was awful! Tell me what he said. He said that he-- he said he-- he rubbed your feet. Your feet! Then I said something to him. And then-- then I-- I just whacked him! Then-- then everything went to shit. And it's all my fault that he raped you. He didn't rape me. He didn't rape you? He didn't rape me. I don't understand. I kissed him. I grabbed him. No-- I pulled him close to me. I held his warm body close to me, and I felt alive. He loves me. Come on, don't say that! He raped you! We made love, Geno. Love. He loves me. Oh, come on, that's all wrong! Why? Because someone can love me? Because he's your cousin! I don't care! I love him! He's married! I-- I don't believe this. I don't believe this! He's through taking care of the neighborhood. He's gonna take care of me for a change. Someone is gonna take care of me. Get out of here. Get out of my house! Get out! How the-- how could you do this to me? Geno. I didn't do anything to you. I thought you'd be happy for me. Be happy? What are you, crazy? All these years, you walk around the way you do. You leave the bathroom door open. You leave the bedroom door unlocked. I don't understand. Just go! Just get out of here! Go to him! Go to him! Is it wrong for me to have someone? You got me! You have me! Isn't that enough? Geno, you're my brother. If that's not enough to keep you here, then I can be more. I can be more! I can be like Nino. Is that what you want? I can be like Nino. Geno! Geno! [crying] My life was over. Sophie and Nina were dead to me. I killed them. I couldn't bear looking at them again. It was all my fault. THERAPIST: You feel you were responsible for them falling in love. You're goddamn right I do! I mean, who's gonna be there to-- to forgive me? Why won't you see me in your office? AL: Anonymity-- anonymity is part of confession. Please don't make specific references. WOMAN: You know who everyone is. AL: Not everyone, but I do know you. WOMAN: Why won't you see me? Answer me. AL: I've already told you. I think it would be better if you spoke to someone else. WOMAN: Better or safer? AL: Safer. WOMAN: Afraid of what people will think? AL: No. Afraid of what I think. Are you all right? I'm fine. Meet me tonight at Castle's on 8th. Midnight. I don't understand. I saw Jerry on Tuesday. He told me he stopped drinking. He said everything was fine. Why didn't you come to me sooner? I did come to you sooner. You know, I trusted you. You told me you were gonna take care of him. You said everything was gonna be all right. AL: I know. I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry is not enough. Since he's been coming here, he's gotten worse. You've made him worse. Now I'm leaving him. 'Cause if I don't, he's gonna kill me or the kids, or I'm gonna kill him. Mary. I'm sorry I failed you. Don't we all fail, Father? [church bell ringing] [organ music] WOMAN (VOICEOVER): It's been a long time since we talked. I don't want to hurt anyone. Help me. Please help me. [knocking] Come in. Al? What's the matter? There's this couple that's all screwed up. The guy's married, but he's in love with this girl who-- what happened to you? I'm pregnant. I'm the father. [dramatic music] I know. Why are you telling me this? You're our priest. I'm your priest? SOPHIE: We had to tell God. So go tell God. Don't tell me. I'm not God, I'm me! I'm your brother, Sophie! And your cousin, Nino! There's no halo over my head, no wings on my back. These collars-- these collars, you can get them in any costume shop for $5. Hey, Al, take it easy. Take it easy? Take it easy! Do you realize what you've done? Do you? We love each other. Well, that's fine for you two, but about the baby? Have you thought about that? Have you? Sophie, you have the same blood. This baby could be born crippled, or-- or retarded, or blind. Dead maybe. Or you could die giving birth to it. We'll live with that. Or maybe the-- the baby doesn't want to live with that. Are you saying abortion? No. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. [thunder crashing] No, I'm not saying abortion. Have you told Geno? I did. Can't you tell? I want to help. No. Al, the thought is enough. Bad enough the church isn't gonna like this. We don't want to involve you that way. This is my family you're talking about. I want to be involved. [door thudding] GENO: Al. Geno, I don't want to fight you. Nobody's fighting anybody. Geno, say hello to your sister. There's nobody here but you and me, Al. Listen, I just got a call from Anthony's bar. That-- that Jerry is out of control. Come on, he's beating the hell out of her. Sophie. Whatever you decide to do, I'll support you. We'll talk later. [thunder crashing] JERRY: You-- you can't leave me! I-- I won't let you! Jerry, I swear to god. I swear to god, I'm gonna call the cops. And this time, they're gonna keep you in there! Come on, take it out back, will you? I don't need the trouble in here. [honking] Just leave me alone, Jerry! I don't want nothing from you! Just leave me alone! I knew that you'd leave me. I knew that you'd do it. Just put the phone down, Mary, and let's talk, OK? Mary. Mary. Mary, put the phone down. Mary. Put the damn phone down, Mary! Come on! Mary. I said put the fucking phone down! Don't you understand? Why do you always make me hurt you? Just give it. Why? Why! [sad music] RECORDED MESSAGE: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial for operator. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you are still alive, I absolve you of all your sins. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. [dial tone beeping] [haunting music] Oh! No. Don't! Please, don't! [yelling] No, cut it out! He's not worth it! Let him go! Leave him alone, will you! He's not worth it! Stop! Get up! Get up!

Fucking mess. What happened to us, Geno? I almost killed a man tonight. You know what scares me? I wanted to. That low-life deserved it. Just like Nino deserves to die. Geno, who are we to decide who deserves what? Look, I don't know how any of this got started, but it's over. What are you talking about? I'm talking about one day we're taking six packs of beer away from kids on street corners, making sure they're home by 10 o'clock. The next thing you know, we're shooting at pimps and pushers on corners. It's over. Thank god nobody was killed. Forget about the neighborhood! How the hell can we take care of the neighborhood? We can't even take care of our own lives. What he hell are you talking about? You can't control Sophie's life. Oh, you agree with them? Is that it? You agree with them? Oh! Geno. You just don't get it, do you? It's not for us to agree or disagree. We've done our job. If-- if how Sophie feels is the result of that, then that's that. All we can do is-- is accept it, understand it, and support her. I don't accept it! How the hell am I gonna go on living, huh? How am I supposed to go to sleep at night knowing that she's not safe in the other room, huh? Tell me! You knew this was gonna happen-- I didn't know that! I didn't know that! Why can't she stay with me? I give her everything she wants. What more can I do? Dammit, Geno, she's pregnant! [dramatic music] Yeah, she's pregnant. And you can't do that. She's gonna make us uncles, Geno. Her and Nino, not Fran and Nino. I don't understand any of this. What's to understand? They love each other. And I think I know how they feel. And if I don't, I'm gonna go find out. What am I gonna do, Al? I don't have the answers for you, Geno. I'm tired of looking for the answers. All can we do is ask the right questions and just pray to God for the right answers. I'm gonna take a walk. I didn't think you'd show up. Neither did I. Do you want a drink? Uh, no. I make you uncomfortable. No. Do you want to leave? No. Why don't we go someplace where we can talk and just be ourselves? This guy I was with kept calling me Sally. I didn't say anything at the time. But after it was over, he kept calling me Sally. Then he says, thanks, here's an extra $100 for letting me use my wife's name. I'm tired of being somebody else's wife, or girlfriend, or mother, or babysitter. I'm me. I'm a person. I want someone to talk to me. When I first came to church and heard you speak, you were talking to me, to my soul. For the first time in my life, a man spoke to me. My father, before he walked out, always spoke to me like a mistake. You showed me I'm not a mistake. I'm a person, just like everyone else. I'll always love you for that. What's the matter? You don't like me? Uh-- [clearing throat] No, it's just very difficult for me to have you up here. Should I go? No. No. I just want to look at you. I want you to have me. I can't. Why not? I know people give you gifts when you do something nice for them. Money for weddings and christenings. Christmas presents. People are thanking you for your services. You saved my soul. This is my way of thanking you. I'm thanking you with my gifts. Flowers would have been enough. I want you to have more than enough. I'll protect you tonight. I won't let anyone harm you. Forgive me. Just forgive me. [organ music] [suspenseful music] I'm sorry, Geno. Ever since we were kids, we were one happy family. I can't help it. I love Sophie. And I have you to thank for it, Geno. You called me that day. It was you. You asked me to take her. You. I promise as God as my witness, I'll never raise my voice or a hand to your sister. And she and our baby will always come before me. I'll wait for you in the cab. Geno. Here's the number where we'll be. Please don't stay away too long, Geno. We don't want your godchild to grow up without you. I love you, Geno, the only way I know how. [music playing] AL (VOICEOVER): You don't understand. They love each other. SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): Love. He loves me. NINO (VOICEOVER): It got very passionate. AL (VOICEOVER): You don't get it. It's not for us to agree or disagree. SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): Someone's gonna take care of me. AL (VOICEOVER): Dammit, Geno, she's pregnant! NINO (VOICEOVER): Ever since we were kids, we were one happy family. SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): Please don't stay away too long, Geno. NINO (VOICEOVER): It was you. You asked me to take her. SOPHIE (VOICEOVER): We don't want your godchild to grow up without you. [suspenseful music] [glass shattering] No! [frantic music] Geno! Geno! Geno, come on. Come on, Geno. [panting] Come on. Are you OK? Hey, Geno, Come on. Come on. [coughing] Are you OK? Huh? You crazy little bastard. You crazy little bastard! What the hell is wrong with you? Huh? Well, who gives you the right to piss on us like this, you crazy little bastard? [coughing] I swear on our mother and father, Geno. If you were to die, I swear, I would have prayed for your resurrection so that I could have killed you myself, you crazy bastard! I was with a woman tonight. I don't want to hear about it. First Sophie, now you. Mom and Pop must be doing cartwheels in their graves. Their son, the priest. Yes, I am a priest. Bullshit. Shut up. Don't strain your voice. Just hear my confession. She was beautiful. Her skin was soft, and her-- her hair like satin. When I breathed her scent, it was sweet, like orange blossoms. When our eyes met, I could actually see the ocean, hear the waves crashing against the rocks, see the tide going in and out. - What did you do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. GENO: Nothing? We danced. We danced for hours. Just her and I in each other's arms. We were in paradise. THERAPIST: Since that night, have you thought about killing yourself? I didn't try to kill myself. I mean, all right, yeah sure, I had a rope around my neck and I was 10 floors above the ground. But it was an accident. I mean, I was sitting on that ledge and it dawned on me. It finally hit me. Sophie said to me, I don't want your godchild to grow up without you. Me a godfather! Do you believe that? Do you know what kind of an honor that is? So then-- then I was just so happy, and I was gonna toast to the health of my family. And I was going to get a sip of wine, and it slipped out of my hand. It is my favorite wine. So I-- I reached out to get it, and I slipped. And I quickly grabbed onto the rope. And I was looking, and down there was Al. And thank god he just danced that day. Thank god. So he pulled me up. And, I mean, you got to think about it. Al and I, we're the only family that they've got. I mean, it's gonna be tough enough for them. So I started thinking, maybe-- maybe it's time to think about somebody else. The world does not revolve around Geno anymore. [music playing]
