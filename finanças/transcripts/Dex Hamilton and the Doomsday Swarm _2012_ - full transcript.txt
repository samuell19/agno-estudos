Jenny, this is Dex. I'm above the sulfur vent. We read you, Dex. I gotta ask. Which part of the word super volcano did you not understand? Isn't it awesome? Whoa! Could you cut it any closer, bug boy? Don't call me bug boy. Dex, it's Zap. We don't have much time. How bad do you want this bug? Pretty bad. The rest of his species has already been wiped out by the volcano. Tung, what are you doing? We talked about that. It may be OK back on Swamp Star, but none of my team eats bugs. I wasn't going to eat it. I was keeping it warm. What do you smell, Tung? Well, this is a sulfur vent, so... Sulfur. Nothing else? Nope. Except there's a cliff bird nest halfway down the other side of the chasm. The birds left two days ago, headed east. Two medium-sized rodents underground, six kilometers that way. And you stepped in something on the way up here. You don't want to know what. Wow. OK. What about the bug? It came all the way to the edge here. He's gone, Dex. Can we be gone too? Dex, this whole place is imploding. We're picking you up. Not yet. Jenny! I've got it! Crawly, one of the coolant pipes has cracked. You get that, I'll get the fuel conduit. Tung, this is an. Yes, I know. It's the only thing they eat. Are there any down there? I feel whatever you said. I'd know it anywhere. There you are! Stay here. Stay here? Where you are going? It's OK. I'm here to help you. Don't fall, Dex! Thanks, Tung. Good advice. Got it! Come up and take the controls! I'm going to get down to them. You can't fly the ship into that vent! It'll get blown apart! I'm not talking about the ship. Oh, right. Sometimes I forget why we call you bug boy. We don't call me that. Come on. You can make it. Just jump into my hand. Whoa! Remember what I said about not falling? Hold on. Hold on! Gotcha! Crawly, get up here and take the controls. I'm going to ricoshield so we can get down there. Oh. It's good to have a bug around. Dex, hold on! It's good to have a bug boy around too. Don't call me that! Everybody, get in! I can only hold this shield for so long! Go, Crawly! Mm! Oh, you are my best friend forever. That's five you owe me. You promised you'd be more careful. Now go get cleaned up. You're making me smell like frog. That was pretty hairy, boss. Was it worth that? There you are, little guy. It's nice to meet you. You've heard of Dex Hamilton. He's the world's only celebrity entomologist. His insect research has led to dozens of breakthroughs in every field from biology to physics to astronomy. And along with his team of dedicated bug wranglers, he has single-handedly put the illegal off-world insect trade out of business. Bugs have been hunted by poachers for more than 300 years. Entire species have been wiped out. And do you know what happens when an important insect species goes down? The entire planet can go down with it. And I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen here or anywhere else. He keeps his rescued bugs here at Hamilton's Habitat, one of the most popular tourist attractions on Earth. Fun spot for the family to visit, or a legitimate threat to the safety of planet Earth. I'm Sally Keaner, and these are the facts about Dex Hamilton. This man is an exterminator. He used to make millions hunting exotic bugs all over the galaxy. Now, thanks to Dex Hamilton's crusade, he can barely swing a fly swatter without facing jail time. Nearly half of the species in that habitat are poisonous. Did you know that? 12 are confirmed man eaters. Five are radioactive. I don't want those bugs on my planet. Do you? Dex Hamilton saves bugs that kill people. I save people by killing bugs. Who's the real hero? Oh, that's ridiculous. Our bugs are no danger to anybody. We're experts, and... and one more thing. If you... One of Dex's experts is Jenny 10. She designed the high-tech systems that supposedly keep the bugs under control. Of course, it's safe. I installed the most advanced security systems in the world. Nothing, and I mean nothing, moves anywhere in this place without me knowing about it. Three, two, one. Hey, Jenny. Look what I can do with this swarm of tar gnats! Dex claims you guys are experts in bug handling. What qualifications do you have? I can smell them from way far away. Back on my planet, we sort of eat them. But I don't do that anymore. Why not? Because Dex showed me the error of my ways. I don't know how that got in there. And what about you, Zap? Is it true you're genetically half insect? Yeah, but I also pilot the Habitat ship, and I'm a... Yeah, just show us your wings. Oh. Despite these assurances, it's hard not to be concerned about thousands of alien insects, many of them destructive and deadly, living in the middle of our city. How much can we really trust Dex Hamilton? These bugs are completely under control. In fact, I invite Sally Keaner to come back here tomorrow with her cameras for a special tour. We'll prove once and for all that people can bring their families here and feel totally safe. Whoa! Oh! Ugh. She's blind, but she's drawn to vibrations in the wood. The razor flea's wing's are so sharp that they can cut through anything. OK, girl. Let's take this nice and easy. Move! Now! My camera. My hero. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You hear that sound? That's her taking in air through the spiracles along her abdomen. If you block the spiracles, the wings don't work. See what I mean? This place is totally safe. Ugh. Oof! Watch it! Ow! This is the place. How can you tell? Because I don't want to walk here anymore. Help me get this beacon set up. Get these things off of me! How? You're an exterminator. Exterminate! Are you trying to kill me? What's the matter with you? Every time... Clinch? Did you see that? See what? Ah! You're seeing things. Help me. Help me! Boss, you OK? Perfect. No, ma'am. That reporter was never in any actual danger. It's perfectly safe to bring your students here. Well, they canceled. Who did? The school field trip. They saw that news report, and they don't want their students in that kind of danger. They won't be in any danger. I've got it under control. Couldn't you guys hear me calling? I've been lost in the subbasement for, like, hours! Whoever designed that place is nuts. Unless it was Jenny, in which case I love it. Yay, subbasement! Oh, that reporter twisted the story to make it look dangerous. She didn't have to twist it very much. That bug almost killed her! Pfft. I had it under control. Dex, if you keep taking these stupid risks, they could shut us down. All your bugs, gone! You guys think I'm reckless? Was that your stomach? The little one. When it's the big one, you'll know it. Would anybody split a party-sized trough of mildew sludge? I'm buying. Jenny, what's wrong with this thing? How can I call sludge kitchen when this call alert keeps blocking me? That's an emergency call coming in, toad brain! We've got a situation. Shibata 4 is a silicon mining outpost, and about four hours ago, the outpost was attacked by a bug. The miners escaped, but not before the bug did some damage. How? We don't even know what kind of bug it was. I'm guessing if it were a ladybug, they wouldn't be calling us. That's true. We're clearly dealing with a very dangerous, deadly species here. So bring the camera. Coming up on the outpost. How much damage could one bug do? How many bugs did they say did that? Just one. Bring the ship down, over there. Something hit these bugs hard. Insecticide? No traces of toxins. No traces of anything. Tung? Something. Oh, ew! Oh, I never thought I'd find a bug smell I didn't like! Ugh. 212 meters. Good. I'm going alone. You stay here... OK. You're just here to study it, right? Don't start thinking we're bringing it with us. Jenny, I'm an entomologist. Not a lunatic. Now spray me with this so I smell like bug food. You're really weird, you know that? Yeah. Be careful. Whoa! I found the big one. It's alive, but barely. Hello there, fellow. Generalized pulverizing mandibles with a basal grinding surface? Oh, nice! Somebody got you, girl? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Whoa, you're a beauty! What's wrong, girl? Zap, bring up the ship. Get ready on the heavy lift up. Two tons at least. Say again, Dex? Do you mean we're picking up that bug? If we leave it here, it dies. Bring up the ship. This is crazy! On our way. It's OK. I've got you. You do, huh? Hello, Dex. Hunter! It's been a long time. And yet, you're still sticking up for these disgusting creatures! Some things never change. Step aside, Hamilton. This bug is mine. Poaching is illegal in this system! Do I look like I care? No! Ah! Jenny's going to kill me for that. Impressive, but let's see you block this. Great flying, Zap. You like that? I'm going to regret this. Brought the harness, Dex. Hook her up. OK. Pull up the harness. Whoa. That's never happened before. Get this thing off us! No! Ah! I got him. Zap, use the grappler rise. The grappler won't take that weight! It'll overload! Whoa. Do you work out? Do it, Zap. Dex, it if overloads the grappler, it'll take the whole ship down with it. Maybe I can reroute some power from somewhere. Come on, Jenny, hurry. Ugh! I told him. It's too much weight. Anytime, Jenny! OK, you're in! Everything went perfectly. Make the call. That thing came this close to eating me. Now I know how pizza feels. Look what it did to my ship. You couldn't just leave it, could you? I didn't have a choice. You didn't have a choice? That thing destroyed a mining outpost. It almost killed all of us, and now you want to bring it into the habitat? You had a choice. You just chose to put all of us at risk. Last I remember, helping bugs is what we do. We don't know anything about this bug except that she's hurt. If we left her there, she wouldn't stand a chance. Is that really what you want? Whatever you say. I think we should keep this bug a secret, just for now, OK? We don't need any more bad publicity. We just got her. Who's going to know? This is Sally Keaner, live at Hamilton's Habitat where celebrity bug man Dex Hamilton is expected to return any minute now with the insect on board. But is it just another specimen? Maybe not. An anonymous expert tipster suggests that it's a ticking time bomb waiting to blow. I think... yes, I see them coming now. How could they know already? That's impossible. Get out of the way! I'm landing here! 114 incoming com requests. Everybody wants an interview. Fine, fine. An interview with Dex? I knew that. Dex, you've got to get these people out of my way, or I'll never get us on the ground. Put me on a public channel. I'll make a statement. I hope you know what you're doing. Hi, everybody. I can see there's a lot of excitement about our latest catch. And boy, she's a beauty! Now you've probably heard she caused some damage earlier today, but if you come with me, I'll show you that she's really, really harmless. Now I'll have to be quiet, because she's sleeping like a little baby. Shh. Did you notice the anterior labrum? Huh. Amazing. It's OK. Everything's under control. My chief engineer, Jenny 10, has her in a stasis field so she can't possibly move. Tung! Ah! Now if you'll clear a path, please, we'll get her inside where she's safe. We've got secure containment tanks inside. Everything's A-OK. Go, go, go! Here we go. Ah! Oh, it's OK. She didn't even wake up. Isn't she beautiful? What is she? I don't know. Something new. She's scared. How can you tell? Have a look. If you look deep enough, you can tell what she's feeling. She's asleep. She's all alone in the galaxy, she's hurt, she's been taken to a strange place by strange creatures. Wouldn't you be scared? Nothing will happen to you here. I promise. I should get back to work. I'm staying here for a while. I'm due for a break. How long did you say that tranquilizer lasts? Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Ah! This computer simulation was delivered to us by a renowned insect expert. As you can see, the destructive potential of the bug is far beyond what Dex Hamilton originally claimed. Could he be putting us all in danger? Um, guys. You better come in here. Uh, Dex, Dex. I've got a question. Please, please. One question at a time. Tell me, Mr. Hamilton. Why should we allow such a deadly bug in our city? I just want to reassure everyone that the bug... um, all of our bugs are completely contained. Oh, really? It didn't seem under control when it crashed your ship. Well, bugs can be unpredictable, but... Isn't unpredictable just another word for dangerous? Look at this. This is a gravity beetle. They have an amazing ability to float above the ground without wings, as if in zero gravity. We don't know how, and we never will, because the last one was hunted down 17 years ago and sold for its pretty shell. This one is a spindle bee. The natives on its planet used its honey to cure any disease. Now they can't, and neither can we, because the last spindle beehive was demolished by human strip mining. I was there. I couldn't stop it. We don't know anything about this new bug. Don't you think we should find out everything we can instead of just leaving her to die? I'll tell you what we know about that bug. It's a monster! Hunter. Hardly Hunter. Hunter Extermination Services. Whether they creep or crawl, we kill them all. I've hunted every kind of bug that crawled or buzzed, and I've never seen one as fearsome as this. That insect is nothing less than a hideous weapon of mass destruction! And it's just one of many within this habitat! She's just a bug! And she's actually beautiful, if you care to look. I've already proposed to the mayor that we deal with this bug before it breaks loose and kills us all! Come in and see it. That's what a habitat is all about, right? Tomorrow, I invite Sally Keaner with the cameras to come in and see the bug and show you just how amazing it really is. Just the press? Why not the mayor? Fine. I'll invite the mayor too. Why not children? I invite the mayor and his kids. Well played. We've been trying put a bioscience transponder on it for four hours. But the bottom line is, we don't have control of this bug. If we have a public show now, somebody's going to get hurt. I got her! Stay here. Hey! Don't show fear. Stand your ground. No fear, no fear! No fear. No fear! Ah! Ah! Ugh! I'm done with this. Ha! Mandibles. Yeah, you showed them to me already. Nice! How does he do that? We've been trying all day. We try not to show fear. He's actually not scared. Oh, she's starving. Did you guys feed her? We tried every kind of bug food we could find. The thing won't touch any of them. Tung even bought it a lasagna! Yes. For the bug. Picky eater, eh? Well, we need her calm for the showing, and that's not going to happen while she's hungry. Jenny, fire up the ship. We've got less than 12 hours. Let's hope that Planet Shibata does takeout. Zap, Tung, try to keep her calm while we're gone. How? Just use your natural charm. Didn't we just leave this party? I didn't like it the first time. Based on my analysis of the bug's droppings... Which you enjoy way too much, by the way. here's what we're looking for. They should be easy to find. Well, that's something. As long as we're at least 20 meters underground, it's freezing cold, and there's lots of nutrient-rich slime that smells like rotten meat. She may be the last of her species, but from the looks of these tunnels, there used to be hundreds down here. You can tell from the striations on the walls. Yeah, striations. Cool. How do we find these mushrooms? Follow your nose. Oh, the way it smells worse. I love my job. Um, Dex? How sure are we that that bug was the only one left down here? Pretty sure. Why? Because we've been here for five minutes, and we're still alive. Great. Aha! There's a fungus among us. Puh! Oh. You weren't kidding about the smell. That's like Tung's feet on a really bad day. OK. We don't need the whole patch. If we just grab one or two, we can use the replicator back home to make more. Jenny, give me a hand. Jenny, I need you! Both together. Come on. That's never a good sound. Remember when I said that bug might be the last of its species? Yeah. It's not. Jenny, grab it! This hand. You... you want this hand? Ah! Oh, no. Can we go now? Yes. Yes, we can. Sorry about that! You'll be fine in a minute! What's their problem? It's actually kind of amazing. Just like hornets back on Earth. Is this really the time for education? When a hornet is attacked, it emits a pheromone that draws other hornets in the area to its defense. When I pulled that harpoon out of the bug in the Habitat, I probably got some pheromones in this hand. So we just stirred up the hornet's nest? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Pretty cool, eh? No. Not cool. Into the ship. Go! 30 seconds. OK. That wasn't so bad. Look at the size of her! You know what? Forget the 30 seconds. We go now! Climb! We took off before the engines were primed. We don't have enough lift! Climb! It's just what we need. Hold on! We're in the clear. She's too big to fly. You know, for a long time, people thought there was no way bees should be able to... Again with the education? Really? Whoa! Just get us out of the atmosphere. She won't go into space. Whoa! How many times are you going to be wrong today? Turn around! Are you nuts? She steers with the wind, but there's no air out here, so she doesn't exactly turn on a dime. Phew! Hey, guys. How'd it go? Great! Yeah. Great. Good. Because you're going to have to get home fast. Guess who's here early? And with the first public viewing of the bug about to begin, the question on everybody's mind is, how much danger are we really in? I intend to find out. Mr. Mayor, what about the voters who don't think Dex Hamilton can contain this bug? Um, I intend to see for myself exactly how unsafe this place is, and take the necessary action. Hurray! There you go, girl. I hope you're feeling better, because here we go. Oh! Welcome to Hamilton's Habitat! Come on in, kids. Ms. Keaner, Mr. Mayor. The bugs are excited to see you. Room for one more? You weren't invited. I'm here as a member of the public. Surely you don't turn anyone away? Of course not. Come in. What's the bug doing? Eating. Seems like that made it happy. Let's hope it stays that way. You guys better get into position. In the subbasement? Oh, man. Dex, I hope you know what you're doing. Kids, right here. Well, I'm not picking up anything at all. She comes from a planet with very little direct sunlight. She doesn't like it bright, especially when she's sleeping. There's a bug in there? I... I want to see. Please! Get it over with, Hamilton. First, I'd like to tell you some things we discovered about her. She weighs about 1,700 kilograms... Oh, who cares? Wake it up! Ugh. Jenny, lights at 50%, please. Zap, Tung, you ready? We're right under the emergency hatch. We think. Have you been in the subbasement? Up, down, left, right. These words have no meaning down here. If that thing goes buggy, don't waste any time. Here we go. Isn't she awesome? I can put the scariest music in the world over this, and it's still going to be boring. But she's not scary! She's beautiful. Whoa! Yeah. Whoa. Well, I'll be. Hamilton. Doomsday bug, or gentle giant? Somebody get a picture of me with that beautiful thing. For the morning news! What's happening? Zap, Tung, get in there! That thing's gone cuckoo! It's OK. This happens all the time. But, um, hey, kids. Let's play a game. It's called don't make any sudden movements. Finally, this is gold. It's OK. As you can see, the emergency force field is very strong. Nothing can get through that. Hey! Over here! Remember me? Ugh! Zap's just hugging her as a precaution. Not to worry. Tung and Zap are expert wranglers. They can handle this. Excuse me. Oh! Everything's under control! Tell that to the guy who's being eaten! Zap, stop struggling! Ah! Easy for you to say. Hey there, girl. Shh! It's OK. You don't want to hurt that guy. It's all right. You're safe here. There you go. That's a good girl. There, you see? She's like a puppy once you get to know her! Even puppies bite. Ah! Dex, you all right? I've got to stop this. Calm down. What's the matter? Why is it doing that? What in the world? Zap, get the kids out of there. Come on, everybody. Show's over. Hi! Over here. Dex, let's go. Dex, please! You can't stay! Tung, I can handle this. Just go! It's OK. Shh! Settle down. Tung! Zap? Tung? Dex! Somebody make a noise! Jenny. Zap! Kids, are you OK? Yeah. Zap, what happened? I don't... I don't know. I can't move my wings. Weird. Come on. We've got to find the others. Dex? Dex, are you... where's Tung? Dex? Shut that thing off. Mr. Mayor, we need to secure this bug. Forget the bug. This man put kids in danger, for Pete's sake! My kids! The man has no compassion. I need my medicine. Hush. Grown-ups are talking. You're in charge now. Take over this place. What? You can't do that. Excellent call, Mr. Mayor. And I don't want Hamilton letting any more of his bugs loose. Until I can get some arresting officers in here, detain him. With great pleasure, sir. Spanner, send in the troops. Access the Habitat computer systems as soon as you're inside. And I'll make sure you have expert help. Ah... oh! Oh. I've always despised you. You're a traitor, because you sided with them, the bugs. The disgusting, foul things! They infest this planet. They outnumber us two billion to one. And you want to protect them? I'm about to destroy everything you've spent your whole life building, and it's going to feel good. Congratulations. You're public enemy number one! Where's the central uplink? Ugh! In your butt. And it's boot activated. Here, let me show you! Ow! Not cooperating will only make it more difficult for you. I'll figure it out myself. You'll never get through my encryption. Says you. I'm in! How did you... Accessing central uplink. Stop that! What are you doing? Understand something, sister. You're not in control here anymore! I am! Booby traps? The boot-butt option's looking pretty good now, isn't it? Get her out of here! Right away, sir. OK, the boss wants us to fan out and contain these bugs. Let's move! I've got to stop these guys. Hey, dirtbags! Let's see what you got. Get him! What? Sit tight, bug boy. Hello again, my precious. Bring in the harnesses. Thanks for cooperating. Tung, I'm sorry. Dex? Is that you? Remember I used to catch Tung sniffing the squidapillars some mornings? He always said he was just checking to see if they needed a bath. He never ate one. Give him credit for that. After a while, he even named them all. When the little one got sick, Tung kept it in his bunk all night, keeping it warm. He did put salt and pepper on it, though. He said it was a home remedy, but I always wondered. It's all my fault. You guys are better off without me. That's the first sensible thing I've heard you say all day. Zap! Somebody's got to say it. Tung would still be alive if it wasn't for Dex. He's right. We don't have time for this. What happened to Tung, we can't change that. But Hunter's still out there, taking apart everything we've worked for, and we can stop him. Don't give up on me now! What's that? Section 14. Huh? The razor fleas in Section 14, two habitats down. Sounds like she's putting up a fight. I hope she tears them apart! Tears them apart. That's it! What's it? Let's hope these walls carry vibrations as well as the trees. If she hears this, she'll be here in a flash and cut us right out of here! Dex, wait! She's two habitats down. She'll come through Zap's cell first. You're right. I already lost Tung. I'm not losing Zap too. I'll handle it. Forget it. My bug half may be gone, but I'm not a total wuss. She's coming. Oh! Zap. Zap! Oh, no! Cover the spiracles on its abdomen to make its wings stop. That's what you said, right? Don't ever scare me like that again! Come on. We've got to move. Guys, wait. I'm sorry. For everything. OK. So what's the plan? Ugh! Spanner's got control of all the doors. I need to get him out of central command, or we'll never get anywhere. Shh! Guys, check out what's on the news. It is not yet know where the bugs came from or what they want. But it's a safe bet Dex Hamilton has something to do with it. She must have followed the pheromone trail all the way back here. Very aggressive. Earth defense has now launched an armed response, and they are expected to intercept the bugs within minutes. Use of lethal force has been authorized. I don't get it. Where are they taking all the bugs? That's what we're going to find out. There's some really old emergency consoles in the subbasement. I might be able to hack one. Good. Try that. Engage the emergency lockdown so nothing gets out. Zap and I will find out where they're taking the bugs. How? The express route. Clinch. What? You know how bugs bug humans, right? Well, do you think humans human bugs? Shut up, Coffer. You couldn't have found an empty one, could you? Shh. Hmm, somebody left this here. Probably those losers from B Squad. Aren't we B Squad? Then it was probably those losers from A Squad. Yeah. A Squad. A Squad, requesting... B! B! Uh, I mean, B Squad requesting access through the lockdown. We have a, uh, bug of some kind. Access granted with annoyance. You're supposed to be done your sweep by now. We're on our way. Please work, please work, please work, please work. You've got to be kidding me. What is it with these bugs? Go quiet them down, or they're going to tip over the crate. Me? But I'm driving. Still got it. Go on, little man. Show those bugs who's boss. Hurry up, OK? I want to go on break soon. Coffer? Hey, Coffer? What's going on? What... whoa! Sweet dreams, fellas. They'll be OK in there, right? Sure. Let's go. Yes! Crawly, are you awake? Good. I think it's time for a little payback. What do you say, buddy? Get down! Get those bugs stacked! There's plenty of room there on the right. That's right. Get them all together for the... Oh, stop complaining. I'm only asking you to do what you're made for. Why you... You dirty, disgusting bug, you! These are the last ones, Mr. Hunter. Finally. Tell everyone to get clear. Things are about to get... Spanner, all systems are go. Then I suggest you clear out of there. With pleasure. Come on! Let's get down there and save those bugs! What are they going to do? They're going to cause another explosion, using her to exterminate all the other bugs! Come on. We've got to get that bug out of the light before it blows. Uh-oh. I'm guessing that's not good. Crawly, hurry it up! And a-done! Oh. That's good. But let him know that we're mad! Open this door! Let me in! That's it, Crawly. Get me full access to all systems! Calm down. We're going to help you! Come on, come on! Huh? Yes! I've got control! Thank you, Crawly. Now go help Dex. That's it, Zap! Get them out of here! Freeze! Hi. Over here. How about a little payback, guys? Oh! That was good, but the bug in you isn't what it used to be. What are you going to? Set this bug free? You can't stop it now. We know your plan, Hunter. And we're not going to let you get away with it. Let me get away with it? You handed it to me. You captured the bug for me. You brought it right into your habitat where I needed it. You made the mayor put your entire collection under my control! And now your environment simulator is charging that bug with enough power to annihilate itself and every living insect in the habitat. Everything exactly as I planned. Word of advice. Stop caring about these bugs. Makes you predictable. Come on. Jenny, come in. Are you there? I'm here, Dex. I need you to shut off the sun in the containment unit. You got it. Yeah! Yes! Ah! Nice try. Hunter, listen to me. The queen is in orbit right now. If her child dies, she'll attack the city! There will be destruction like even you don't want. Nonsense! When this bug dies, the queen will fly home. In a way, by killing it, I'm saving the city. I'll probably get a medal. Hey, Hunter! Zap, you got your strength back! Not exactly. It wasn't a very heavy crate. Let's try that again. Get off me, you bug freak! Get ready. Missing something? It's time to go. Hey. Hey, boys. Look who I found. Technically, I found her. Where have you been? I got blown right through the floor into the subbasement. Couldn't you guys hear me calling? Ugh. It's like a parallel dimension down there. You promised me you were going to be more careful. Don't ever do that to me again, you slimy toad. You're going to get frog smell all over you. I can take it. Let me out of here. Let me out of here! Bugs! Bugs! Try not to show fear! Jenny, quick. Go to night mode. Night mode. That's not helping. She's overloaded. And I bet she's putting out pheromones like a beacon. The queen's not going to like that. The queen's got to see she's OK before things get ugly down here. Then let's go. Hey! That thing almost killed you, twice. And you're still ready to help it? It's worth it, right? I'm not letting you guys do this. This one's all me. Hey, girl. Down here. Zap, I'm going to need a new window. Quickly. Here goes nothing. You can do it, girl. You're free. Just go! Dex, you're going to need to take her into the upper stratosphere. You can't ride that high! She won't do it without me. You can't breathe up there. You'll pass out and you'll fall. Just as long as she gets in range of the queen. At least let us follow in the ship. I need five minutes to warm it up. No time. You won't make it back! Maybe, but it's going to be awesome. Thanks, guys. For everything. Let's go, girl. Well, what are you standing there for? Get the ship warmed up. You think I'm just going to let him fall? We're receiving word now the first wave of defenses has proven ineffective. Citizens are now being advised to evacuate the city. I repeat, get out of the city while you still can. There may be nobody to save us now. Higher, girl. You have to go higher! You've got friends looking for you. Keep going, higher! Whoa. Your queen is on the other side of that. We have to get through. Are you ready? Ah! Keep going. Higher! Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop! Come on, come on. Power up! Don't stop. Don't stop. It's going to be OK. Going to be OK. There they are. You made it, girl. You made it. Ugh! The bug boy is back. Yeah. The bug boy is back. Come on! We've got a family reunion to get to. There she is. Once the queen knows they're not in danger... the defensive instinct goes away. It's nice when families look out for each other. Yeah. Isn't it? Go on. Go ahead. All this work, fighting to keep the bug in the Habitat, and you're letting her go? That's it? Letting her go, yeah. But we're far from done with her. These bugs are going to need protection, and I think I know someone who can help them get it. Good afternoon. It's been three days since the events involving the newly discovered beetle, and the world is aching to hear what has happened to our favorite bug-loving team. To learn more, I had an interview with the man responsible for the attack, recently disgraced exterminator Hartley Hunter. Mr. Hunter, do you have any comment on the events that happened three days ago? Ah! Bugs! Bugs, bugs! Bugs, bugs! Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! It's pretty much all like that. But first, my top story begins on the planet Shibata, where Dex Hamilton announced a new breakthrough that could revolutionize the planet. He'll be... Hey, everyone! This way! Slow down! Come on, come on. Hey, girl. Show the nice people your wings. You see what she's doing? Her wings are highly specialized cells that collect every bit of sunlight and store it, 1,000 times more efficient than any man-made solar collector. Incredible. Our brilliant engineer Jenny has already started studying how they work. With a little luck, we'll be able to synthesize something like them. That'll be the end of the Earth's power troubles forever. Think what would have happened if we'd destroyed her. It's always better to learn. Bugs have a lot to teach us if we only... Thank you, Dex Hamilton. I'm Sally Keaner, and these are the facts about Dex Hamilton. OK. Let's wrap it up. Actually, I think we need more B roll of the other members of the team. Zap, why don't you tell us about your social life? Friends? Girlfriend? Oh, awesome. Oh, I like to talk about my social life. Just, uh, just tell me what a social life is. Oh, is there better light over there? OK. Uh, make sure you shoot my good side. But they're all good. So what's next, Dex Hamilton? Vacation? Absolutely. I think we've earned a break. That's why we're going to the New Zone. The methane pits there are home to a new species of dung beetle, and I was hoping to get a mucus sample. It's going to be awesome! Sounds great, Dex. Sounds great.
