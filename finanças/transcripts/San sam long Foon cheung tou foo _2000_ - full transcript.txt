OK Come on. It's romantic.... ...with stars, you always come here? Right, always. Do you bring your girl friends here? Sure, I cheated and brought girls here. We counted the stars and listened to the waves, then we went to the wood and made love, then I'd strangle them, then chopped them up and threw the parts to the sea. You're evil, why scare me ? It's true. Softly, it hurts. Not me. Why are there other people ? Who is he ? Beat. Stop it. OK...you stop. In fact, I'm your target. I'll play with you, but not three together. One by one, the others watch aside. But you must pay money. OK, I'll go first. I...I can't take anymore. What are you doing ? Are you blind? Don't hinder me, get lost. You're nuts. Don't get mad.

Stop beating... Hubby! Hubby! Wife... If you serve me well, I'll grant you lower interest rate. Come in. Shall I massage your head ? As you like, massage me well. What is it ? I can't breath. Sorry, I'd better massage your legs for you. Take it easy. Shall I help you wank? Hello, how are you ? Wanking for him ? Making love is better than wanking. As wanking will hurt you, go away now that you've finished. Brother Shark, why cast my clients away? Why? This is my area of influence. Why are you here? Don't forget your husband owes me lots of money, and you owe me one, you know ? Didn't we agree last time ? I pay interest once a week, I paid last tuesday. Girls love playing with me, come on. Help ! Brother Shark, I've found that guy who snatched the bracelet. Where is he? He is wanking next door. Let's get him. I'll spare you this time, let's play next time. You asshole, you bastard You're great ! Tell me about it ! You bastard, dare you snatch my thing ? Is this bracelet yours ? Speak back? Beat him ! Stop beating, I've got the bracelet. Chun, your mom gave you this bracelet. Say no more, we must be righteous as we're buddies. Don't give it to him. Enough, say no more Don't give it to him. Dare you take it here. Boss, you get it back. Only a hero can wear such a jade, you don't deserve it. You rob other's thing and say you're a hero ? What kind of hero are you ? You're a robber. Who are you to say that to me ? You get the bracelet now, let us go at once. You put a knife on my neck, and scared me. Brother Shark, I put the knife on you and snatched the bracelet. It has nothing to do with them, spare them. Let them leave and you'll fix me. OK, you're a righteous guy, but I love seeing others suffering. I damn you. What ? You damn me ? Doesn't it taste good ? Let me smell. It's so stinky. Brother Shark, we're wrong in this case, we'll compensate medical expenses to you. Please spare us, give us a price. Of course the money but I also want you to suffer. Since you offer, I'll give you a way out, we'll pay a game. Head you win and tail you lose, ok? OK, agree, let's bet on head. Good, It's head...we're lucky ! We may go now ? Where can you go ? You eat your word ? How can you walk like this ? Damn you, I don't come out to walk. I run a finance company. You bastard, you are real evil ! His nails are dirty, fix them for him. Chun, I'll get back your bracelet for you one day. I must revenge on this. I swear I must chop him into pieces. He beat me up like this. And the bracelet, I must get it back I must prepare a coffin for him and make him die horribly. Look at the scenery here What is this? A human leg Don't go, I'm scared It's ok, let's take a look. You bring home another case ? You spoil the rules. What case are you investigating? A body in a box, fractured skull, raped. The killer is very cruel. What are you doing ? Nothing...very cruel. Any clues so far ? I've checked the missing people, it proves to be the ball room hostess who disappeared last week. You police are efficient. I guess we'll arrest the killer very soon. I thought we would, but after investigation, she has no boyfriend and people around her have no motive. Did her clients do that ? You seldom show interest in my cases, you know her ? Nuts, how could I know her? I'm just asking. You know I have a detective mind, may be I can help. Forget it, I can tell you, as papers will print it tomorrow. I've checked the mamasan, a strange client paid full tickets on that night, but he looked gentle, not like a killer. No motive? Killers today are varied. Some are tall, short, gentle, rude and some are even maniacs. When making love some like biting the tits, biting the body, and some love stuffing the vagina with things. Forget it, say no more, it's disgusting. OK, It's really disgusting, let's... What is it ? What ? you know I want that. In daylight? Why not ? just pull down the curtain. Didn't we make love last month ? you know It's last month No, only 3 minutes What? 3 minutes is not enough 1, 2... OK...I'll take a bath at once ! I must hurry back to police station, bye. Wife, how can you do that ? I can only wank now. Do you know police are working seriously now ? This box is loosely covered. I've said you'll harm us. Damn it, I was too nervous. It's ok, I spoilt her face, so no one can recognize her. You tale-tell. What ? Dare you repeat ? I say you're tale-tell. What tale-tell ? Tale-tell is you. Stop shouting, we're buddies, we're on the same boat. I'm OK, don't worry Listen, police are checking, I think it's interesting. Are you really OK ? Think over, we've commited so many cases, and every of it stuns HK, but no one knows they're done by us, what a shame. You nuts run naked if you want a fame! But I want face. Chun, ask yourself if you're happy? I say, what we've done is not abnormal, but . . . a normal guy won't ever do such a thing Go to hell You mean we're abnormal ? I don't agree, my IQ is high. You have strong lust for sex, sure, it's better than you love killing. I only kill bad women, what's wrong? I don't mean you're wrong, or we won't be together you only spoil our relation for the sake of dirty women, and make us motherless. You bullshit all night, but you're right in this. Police are noticing, we'd better stop for a while. I don't agree. Why ? I can stop killing women but shark beat us like this. Right, shark beat you so hard. So we must give him a coffin. Count on me, I'll do it neatly. Look at you, let me clean your mouth. Come, you get so dirty with the food. Ted ! Ted ! Why do you come here ? You want to see the toys ? I want a watch. You want a watch, but I can't buy you one. I'll ask dad to buy it for me if you don't. Ted, mom has no money, OK, be good, let's go home. I'll go if you don't. I won't go, mom, you're bad. Ted, go and change your clothes, ok ? OK. Who are you ? Who are you then ? How come you're taking a bath here ? Why not? It's brother Hong's home. I won't come out Why is she having a bath here ? Tell me ! She's my friend Friend? A friend takes a bath here/ Never mind her, go and get dressed I don't care if you fool outside, but you bring girls home? You bitch ! Don't scold others OK...what do you want? What do you mean ? You beat me for her ? What if I do ? You're lucky I didn't kill you ! I want a divorce. Why ? what's so special ? Say, you want her or me ? Tell her you want her or me. Of course I want someone young but I work hard to pay your debts. You offer to, I never force you to do that. Bitch, if you can do that, I can do that too. Hubby, don't worry, I'll support your living. You're my real honey. Mom, why are you crying ? Son, leave with mom, ok ? Go yourself, he's my son. He's my son, I gave birth to him. Nuts, without me, how can you have a son ? Son... Go away yourself. Mom... Why are you here ? I come to see you. I'm working, no time, go away. I'm free, come on. What do you want ? What ? I come to collect debts. I tell you, I've parted with Hong already, his debts have nothing to do with me anymore. You're ignorant, you've taken up the debts, so you're in charge now, you're kidding. Brother Shark, I run short of money now. My son has to go to school and I move out. Anyway I have no relation to him, I needn't pay his debts. None of my business, I need money too. I really have no money. OK, I give you a chance you served me well last time. So now serve me well and I'll skip your interest, OK ? Come on ! Men, have you fooled enough ? I'll die if you play me on. Don't worry, I won't let you die easily. We're rivals, our hatred is too deep. Do you remember we begged you hard last time ? You said you'd beat us whenever you see us, we scared. I beg you to spare me, I was wrong last time. It's a misunderstanding, spare me and make friends, OK ? I don't blame you for this. Just spare me, OK? Why do you still bullshit ? Boss, what do you want ? I want all your money. OK...as you like, just as you like, as long as you people feel happy. Didn't you behave cocky last time ? Why are you like a dead dog now ? Boss, I'm a businessman, I'm not on the walk. I beg you, give me another chance. If we give you a chance... ...you'll never spare us. What exactly do you want? I won't spare you anyway. My legs ...oh, my legs ! Aren't you superman ? Right, you're superman. Go to hell. It hurts. You must revenge for your brother. He beat him so hard that he has concussion now. Right, I nearly forgot. You wanted to castrate me ? Castrate me... Go ahead, castrate him. Enough, he's dying, put him in the box. Get your things back. Take it. It smells blood. Stop fooling, kill him. I design this box myself. Look, there're holes, water goes in and it'll stay under water forever and then he can rest in peace, do you agree? Lie down, I made it to your figure. Be good, lie down. Sleep now. Go ahead. It's heavy. Stop nagging, hurry. The holes, without holes, water won't go in and it'll float up. Look, what is this ? Fix him now. You're timid, why fear the bones ? This should be your duty. Be a good guy in your next life, goodbye. Don't say goodbye to him, we kill him for the sake of the society. Throw him to the sea. This is Wan Lai-ming, I can't answer your now. Who's calling Wan Lai-ming ? My name is Chin. Mr. Chin, what's your phone number ? We have so many cars, why drive this small one ? You know I don't walk properly. It's your own problem. Let's go elsewhere. Why? I want chinese food. You know I don't walk properly OK, as you like. Wife, the set dinner here is good. Try it, Wife. Wife, are you allright? What's wrong with you ?

Why are you here ? Come out, I want to talk to you. Go away. Take your hands off. I want to talk to you. You nuts, why do you come here ? I really miss you so I come here for you. He's back, I'll call you tomorrow. I don't care. I'll call you up later, ok? I need you. Go away. Wife. Are you allright? I'm fine. Want to see a doctor? No need. I order salad for you when you were away. Come, you like it. What's wrong with your lips ? What's wrong ? It's ok, let's eat now. Isn't it delicious? Hi, miss Wong, long time no see. May I sit down ? This is ? My name is Chin. Hello. Mr. Chin is my former colleague. Former colleague ? No. We are very good friends. Say no more, eat something first, eat. It's ok, I'll order some more. You seem to have put on weight. Your bottom's are fat, and legs are still pretty, so you mustn't eat too heavily. I want some salad, hurry up. Hey, Mr. Ching, do you agree? Are you mad or something? What? You say I'm mad, then why didn't you say so last time? I'm dining with my husband, please leave. Want me to go away? Go away. Mr. Chin?

You know I love heavy massage. Harder please. You have heat inside I work over time every night, I sleep badly. What if I help you out? No, let's have a chat. I don't know why I can't sleep well. I have no idea. I've been dumped, 3 years ago, I love her. She loves me too, but she doesn't want me to see her, and she won't come for me. She called me up, saying she lives badly. Why does she do this to you ? Because her husband has come back, Sorry... It's ok, have a smoke first Love is really killing. You seem to be experienced. Your love is 3 years, but I've been with him for 12 years, and we parted at last, let's not mention it again. OK, let's forget the unhappy incident. Let me treat you to late supper, OK? I still have to work I'll wait till you're off duty. Wait on, bye. Hello. What are you doing here? What am I doing ? You forgot that ? I said I'll treat you to late supper, OK? OK. Here's your beer. Your work in the bank at daytime and study at night. Don't you find it hard? You know there're many graduates in HK, if I don't study, it's hard to get a promotion. An ambitious man like you... ...is hard to find now. Tell me something about you Do you have a boyfriend? I was married and now divorced, I have a son. You have a son? Right. If your son resembles you, then he must be lovely. Right, he's 3 years old, going to kindergarten. Does he? Sorry, my son calls me up. Hello, Ted, why aren't you sleeping ? I'll take you out on holiday, ok? But you must be good, go to sleep now, OK? OK, go to sleep, be a good boy, bye. Mom must hangs up now, bye. You pamper your son ? Yes, he's vital to me, I can't live without him. I want to ask you a personal question Since you pamper your son, why divorce with your husband ? I think this is unfair to your son. I always loved him, though I knew he had lots of girls outside. I never blamed him, but he beat me in front of that girl, and cast me away. Say no more, tell me about you. Did your mom pamper you when you were small? Yes, I was much luckier than you. I had a better life than you. Right, you were lucky. Which one you want ? Every one of them, how much ? Look, Chun is dating. That girl is great, she has big busts. Let me greet him. Don't hinder him, he's dating. I think they must have a special relation. You're too much, you met a masseuse and won't tell us. No, she's not pretty, not your cup of tea. You mustn't say so. You want to take her alone, and don't introduce her to us ? You haven't cum for ages, mind you're hurt . If so, I'll wank. You mustn't wank too much. I'll shoot the cum on your mouth. Nuts, masseuse is like ball room hostesses. Quick, bring her and let us enjoy her. No, she's a good girl. Don't touch her, she has a son. Nuts, stop pretending na?ve. Are you serious with her ? There won't be result for you. Don't be nuts, just fever and leave her. Ask her out tonight, OK? Right, ask her out. Hi. Morning. Sorry, I'm late. It's ok, I have time. You've waited for long ? Just a while. Why do you ask me here ? I want seafood in Cheung Chau It's too far away. How come you have a key ? Why? Just for you, I rented it yesterday. You wicked guy. Why don't you speak ? Anything wrong ? I have something to tell you. You needn't tell me. Who are you? What do you want? Come on, make love. Very big. No, what do you want ? No, help... Leave me alone. Eat noodle. Eat noodle. You're not human, you're beasts, I kill you. You think you can survive ? Guess what we are doing No! My son calls me up, let me answer the phone. Shut up, bitch. She got a son. My son calls, please let me answer. I have no other request Ionly want to talk to my son. ...the last call. I won't resist even if you kill me. I beg you, ok ? I won't report this to the police, please. Mom ? Ted, mom is working. Aren't you taking me out? I'm busy tonight. I don't care. Mom can't see you anymore, so you must study hard, then I will pamper you. And you must learn to take care of yourself, then I'll love you. Mom have to work now. Have you finished? I get her here, I'll be in charge. You're mad, you want to free her ? Didn't you see? She cares so much about her son before she dies. You don't want the poor kid to have no mother. We all lost our mother when we were small, and that's why we become bad. But if you free her, we'll all die. If we spare her life, she won't report us to police. Even if she does, I still want her to survive. I take responsibility. If you dare not, I'll kill her. I ask her here, I'll decide whether to kill her or not. No way, we have always made unanimous decisions. If Lai and you decide to free her, I have no objection. You say. We're buddies, don't shout. Chun, you mustn't be lenient, women are unreliable. Think over, Chun, do you agree? I'm always against killing, I only help you out. What ? Right, you both do all the killing, and I'm against it. You two are nuts. Stop shouting, 1 to 1, you have no rights to say. This woman is good, she's not like those we kill, they are bad women. I also feel that she won't harm us. OK. you shall decide. I walk her out. OK, I won't see you to the pier. I really thank you Last night I was feeling despaired. I've always been in bad luck. When I was small, a man drugged and raped me. When I married a man, I thought I had a fresh start, but he loved another woman. Now I have nothing. Just like a dream. Wan, is she reliable ? Police is coming, try our luck, run... Take it easy, see the situation first. Let's watch on. That man behaves strangely, go and check him. Look at you, wearing a sweater in summer. You're sweating all over. Remember to give me a call when you're home. Come on. Come here... What did you say ? Nothing, she didn't say anything to me. I only thanked him just then. I'm really grateful to you three, I thank you for sparing me. I'll leave now, bye. Come here...quick! What is it ? Here's my phone number, come join us if you have time. Take it, don't report to police, do take care. I'll leave now. Chun, is it allright? I don't feel easy. Should be no problem, if there is, it'd have happened. If you can't feel easy, let's hide ourselves in Macau. Macau? Good We can fever in Macau When to go? Let's go Come in You want me, Sir? Right, sit. Yes, Sir. We're checking the ballroom killer case and I'm sure you know it. We have important clues now. Last night someone reported to us saying a woman got raped, and nearly got killed. But she escaped and the suspect left his pager number. We've checked, the owner is Ho Wan Yee and that's yours, 542-963, Ho Wan Yee. We now suspect you're related to this case. Yee, why are you back so early ? Officer. Got it. Mr. Yeung Tak Lai? I'm Sergeant Lau. We suspect you're related with the series of murders. Please come to the station with us. Officer, what is it ? What is it ? Sir, may I talk to him ? What have you done ? What have you hidden to me ? I don't know what you're saying. Stop acting again. The victim has your pager number you know ? Maybe she made a mistake, so many possibilities... Police have collected enough evidence... ...to prove you're involved in the murders, you know?
