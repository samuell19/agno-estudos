We're looking for a... ...a part-time job. Not for the money, no. More by... ...by interest. To stay in the game. I think that... we still have a lot of things to offer... ...to the community. If one of your colleagues steals truffles that belong to the company, how would you react? I think I would convince him to admit his crime. A) You ask him to give you half of the truffles he stole. B) You do nothing. C) You reprimand him and immediately inform your superiors? "C." Bon app?tit. Excuse me, but... you forgot my truffles. I'm really sorry, the harvest wasn't really good today. Harvest?! What harvest? All I see is three flakes. I didn't come here to get screwed, you know! Listen, it's not my fault, sir. We don't want to screw you at all. You don't call that screwing? Three flakes! If you're not happy, just go get your truffles yourself! Don't think that because we're labourers we don't have feelings, miss. He's ready. Charles! Where were you? I was delayed at work. There's nothing left at the diner. When are you going to collect the truffles? As soon as I have a minute to myself. They have limited resources. What? Alice.
