Will you donate? - Donation!? Nobody here will donate! Put the phone down!! How many times will they harrass for donations!? If you have, why not give? - I can't give - Excuse me? Let me explain Apparently someone needs 9 lakhs for a surgery... Meaning that the surgery won't happen without that amount The maximum I can give is about one or two thousand How much will these pittances add up to? In the time that they give the money, what if the patient dies? - I can't believe it - Don't just do whatever you can Do what's necessary, what is required. That's what I believe Ah yes... Hello? Tell me Listen, a small mistake has happened here What happened!? Johnson has come to know about the video What are you saying?? What happened!? I went to inside to have a bath I kind of felt shy having him there So I left him outside, but by the time I finished my bath... Why the hell did you need to bathe!? Dammit, is my life a game to you all!? Whether or not you bathe, you'll still look like a solar eclipse! Really sorry. This won't happen again What are you sorry for? Keep your sorries Don't play games with my life Make sure he's well hidden, please Yeah I'm on it What happened? Johnson has come to know about the video Johnson has come to know about the video!?!? -What video? - It's nothing ! Its a... erm... That is to say... His fiancee! He had promised her that he wouldn't drink Now a video of him drinking has come out We're trying to get it deleted, with Paapa's help Have some shame It's important that she doesn't find out But isn't it wrong to suppress the truth? No matter what, the correct thing to do is to tell her the absolute, complete truth Not telling the truth may be wrong, but suppressing it isn't They are the same thing!! You are mistaken, like most teachers ! The thing is... Telling a lie, is telling... Hiding the truth, is hiding How can hiding the truth the same as telling a lie? It's all the same! Absolute cheating, ok!? Oh! Cheating!? Thats too strong a word. It isn't cheating It is cheating! I know!! I know that feeling How do you know? Because I was cheated! By my husband! It wasn't feeling right I knew something was wrong I even checked his phone! But, nothing! But later... I recovered and read his deleted mails and messages And my doubts were confirmed He was cheating on me! Dude! Just pull over, here. My dad's calling. Please stop Yeah... - Hello dad? - Where are you!? I'm on the way! Tell me exactly where you are! I'll be there in an hour I asked where you are! Not when you'll be here! You haven't even gone for your suit trial! Where exactly are you!? I... I am... Bachelor's party! I'm at a bachelor's party! What!? Have you no brains? With the wedding so close why do you even need a party? What to do? Friends! Friends! So you drink, is it!? Useless fellow! Let me have a word Look, we've already had to compromise a lot for your sake Why are you behaving like a madman at the last minute? Don't forget your father's heart! He shouldn't be this tense. - Come home now! - I'm coming!! It's just... This party... Get your butt here soon! Answer one question right away, though What name will you give your babies when they are born? Hindu? Or Christian!? What do I even say to this ignoramus!? If you feel like it, have a good cry No shame in a man crying Cry it off Dust bro, dust Just dust Dust Felt hungry. Come in soon! Lets eat. Eat... Eat well Whatever the problem, biryani is the solution The problems will go away, and stress also goes down If you lie so much, stress is what will come Why are you making a big deal out of a few drinks that I had? But that is not all you've hidden You also hid that honeymoon video, right? I told her not to tell anyone, bro! - Listen! - Yes? - You're not hiding anything from me? - No, nothing like that akka You're telling me the absolute truth now? I'll tell you-... What are you blabbering, man!? She's a teacher! She knows what to say to to bring out the truth! People of THIS type will delete their browser history! They'll delete their call history! And their WhatsApp chats! And when they're caught, They'll say, 'it isn't cheating'!! If that's so, isn't looking into our phones cheating as well? The only correct thing is to tell your fiancee the truth It's acting, after all! She'll understand... It looks very real. It was shot on a phone With the wedding tomorrow, nobody will believe me... Nobody will believe me... They'll be tough to convince But if you hide the truth, you'll only be a cheater How? Let me explain Just consider this... All of this happened to your fiancee, and not you A similar real-looking phone video was made Just... Acting! It was shooting It was not real And your girl acted in it. She did nothing else. She, too, didn't do anything. She just slept through the full video With 2 days to the wedding, that phone video leaks out... She comes to you, plays the video, and says, 'I never knew, it was all just acting, please believe me I am innocent' At that time, would you accept her story? Tell her the truth before the wedding Marrying her otherwise would be very wrong And if you don't, I'll tell her at the wedding myself Be it telling lies, or hiding the truth, isn't marrying a woman and cheating her wrong? Raks, man... So sorry I won't tell anyone ever again Again!? What the hell do you mean? "Again" it seems! You better get on with the deleting For your own good... I'll kill you otherwise Yeah I'm on it Even if he deletes it, his sister said she'll come tell the truth... All we have to do is kidnap the sister - Hey! That's my sister! I just want to disappear! If only a few days... could just be skipped, it would be great If only life had a skip button! You know what I'm saying? Like a skip button on a video. To skip... - Dude, life means-... - Shut it, man! Life means to shut your gob! Now I've to take his advice also You know, if you ask me... I think telling Steffy everything is correct Fear kills. Rather than die a hundred fearful deaths, It's better to tell the truth once and for all Take the phone... Call her, I say This is unwanted inspiration now! You decide to tell the truth and make a call now, we'll all be hurt Don't do it I've meditated upon fear guys It creates illusions of what isn't there... and makes molehills seem like mountains... I'm telling you, just call her and tell the truth If you make a call to your folks and tell them the truth, they're not going to give you the damn Bharat Ratna Award! They'll cut you up for having hidden it so far - Don't talk - Hey Lies bring joy today, but sorrow tomorrow the truth brings joy today, but sorrow-... Well, I think I did not say that right, but you say it right to her. Tell her the truth, please! - I know women physically... - What the hell!? Psychol... I mean psychologically Don't tell. Do not tell. - I'm telling you as a friend, call - I'm telling you as a friend, don't call! - Call! - Don't call! - Don't call! - Call! I'm telling you not to call!! I'm getting a call!! She's calling - is it? - Steffy Steffy Stop the car! Stop right here! - Take the call! - Take it, but don't tell the truth - You have to tell the truth! - No no no!!! Yes yes yes!! Listen, now! Rather than die a thousand deaths, face the problem once and for all!! What the hell are you going in a loop for? - Enough with your googled philosophies! - You shut up! Will you listen to me or not? Talk to her! Will you listen to me or not? Don't talk! - He'll tell her! - He won't! - He will!! - He won't!! - I'll make him!! - I won't let you!! Hello? Where are you? I'm at the hospital! Friend had an accident right. That's why I'm here Hello? Hello? Hello! - What happened? - She cut the call! Oh God! I thought I'd say the old lie-...

Was he caught? Was he caught? - Why are you in the car? - Steffy, the doc says it's serious!! I told you that my friend had an accident, right... I just came out to buy medicines for him "Move your vehicle sir! Don't you have any common sense? I've got a patient here!" "How can you sit there yapping oh the phone! Move your vehicle!" Oh God!

How many times did I ask you? - Why hide things from me? - Sorry I was scared you wouldn't understand my side of things... Why wouldn't I understand? Because you're overly sensitive...

Let me explain You remember I came to visit a sick student of mine? They said, 'she's in a critical condition' The treatment would cost 20 lakhs, they said I tried every source I could Finally I decided on a ransom for that video I didn't know how to do it, though Then... Google!! Hello, this is King Hacker I anticipated that you might doubt my involvement... That's why I came for the wedding... and called him as King Hacker Not this stop. The next stop... Don't you think that someday, Kamu would ask me who King Hacker is? What do I say? Who? Kamu? He's an idiot, bro. Show him a photo of whoever you want. He'll believe you... It's okay... Traitor!! 19,40,000/- I'm still paying off the installments Boss? Do you have the video? Can we see it? Why are you after that video? Even if the sky falls, all you care about is the video...

I got a story Listen up Listen! Come, let me tell you a story I’m telling only you Let me whisper it into your ear And I’m telling only you Isn’t your life in itself a story? And aren’t you the hero of that story? Tell me your story Make me tell you mine Yours as mine Mine as yours Let’s keep swapping stories just to pass the time come, come What is justice, and what is duty? Who am I to judge? Who is good, and who is bad? Everyone’s a character in the story anyway! Come, let me tell you a story I’m telling only you Let me whisper it into your ear And I'm telling only you once upon a time in a kingdom of yore ruled a mad king the maddest in lore people sang his praises out of the fear he had fed legend told of a warrior; the Tiger who would behead in every story ever told what is poison? and what isn't? what is wrong? what is right? what is magic? what is fraud? who is good? who is bad? who's who in which story? who is pulling the strings? we won't ever know Will we? Seen through your eyes his story seems different Seen through his eyes your story looks different but look at your story through his eyes and the scales will fall from your own i'll tell you a story that subverts storytelling i'm like a pen who's story is the ink that's flowing this is between you and me you and me, us three dig deep, and the truth shall set you free How similar are we? How different are our thoughts? how diffferent are our stories? are we good or bad in them? no heroic act, and the story lacks flavour be fearless, and they will sing about you forever Once the façade is forced to fall, your life is a story, after all Once the façade is forced to fall your life is... Isn’t your life in itself a story? And aren’t you the hero of that story? 1... 2... 3 to the 4 we'll sing a little low to bring back the flow no matter what may be no matter who says what even if nobody wants to listen to your stories... never stop believing whatever the hell may come to pass in that story, you're the Alpha in your story, you're the Hero in that story, you're the Alpha in your story, you are the King!
