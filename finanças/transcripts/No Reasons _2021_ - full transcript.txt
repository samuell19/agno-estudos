Jodie, is that you? It's her, yeah? It's hard to tell. These are becoming really frequent now, I think it's a sign. Yeah, she's been gone a long time now. Maybe she got it out of her system. Come on let's get you inside, getting cold out here, come on. In the build up to the anniversary of Jodie Bryant's tragic disappearance of Brentwood Essex. Her parents have launched a fresh appeal for her return. Jodie Bryant was 14 years old at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen in school around lunch time, and it's thought she went home to collect some belongings before heading to the train station. With the exception of scattering of unconfirmed reports around Essex, it seems that Jodie has just disappeared. Police have been unable turn anything up concrete since her disappearance. Someone must know something. Someone must have seen. Or be sitting with her right now. Or she could have died. Or been killed. Someone must know something. Contact the charity or the police anonymously. You don't need to give your identification. We would just like some answers thank you. Over the past year Sally Bryant has actively searched for her daughter. To many a familiar sight on the railway networks. She's often found in railway stations or shopping centres at times a high profile campaign. Mrs Bryant? Yeah? I'm Kevin I'm from the Essex Mercury. I was sent by your solicitor to speak about Jodie? Right, so Clive sent you, okay come in. So, can you tell me about the day it happened? In the morning everything seemed fine, we had breakfast together. Jodie went to school. My husband left for work, and I left for my work. When I came home, everything still seemed fine. But she never came home. When did you realise something was wrong? I called around five, and I heard her phone ringing upstairs. She's a teenager. Teenagers takes their phones everywhere, so Immediately I knew something was wrong. Do you think she disappeared on purpose? Oh fuck I don't know. Sorry. What do you think happened? I think she thought she was an adult. And its likely caused her to run away. Very shortly afterwards she realised she was a child. Threw weeks later, we started getting phone calls from local phone boxes. Basildon, Orsett, Tilbury, Colchester. But she never withheld the number. I believe she was waiting for us to say something that Would make her come home. Do you think she's safe? I hope so. Tell me about what you have done to bring her home. We've done everything. Everything. I now go to the town and hand out flyers. And we did set up a charity. But, people forget. And we haven't had any donations for six weeks. How do you er, how do you feel? How do you think I feel? I'm empty, I'm destroyed. I just want my child back. If you could tell her one thing. What would it be? I'd tell her to come home. Just come home. It doesn't matter we love her. Just come home. Hello? Is that Clive? Hello Clive, its Kevin. I've made contact with Mrs Bryant Yeah, I'll try my best to help them find her. I'll cover the story this week. Okay thats good. Yeah I'll talk to you then. Hello? Yeah this is her. Your shitting me? Where? It's definitely her? Sorry, where? Okay thank you. Girls, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. We had another sighting, sorry. Hello? Hello Paul. Jules how's it going? Well you know, I'm not getting the money I should be, your two months behind. Yeah about that Jules I'm a bit skint at the minute mate. I'm in so much debt you know sally is still trying to find Jodie. To be honest I have no interest in your personal arrangements what so ever. You have no issue with borrowing the money, but it's always the same with people like you. Always reluctant to pay it back. No, its not like that mate, I just need a little bit more time. Times up, Paul. We had an agreement and you have failed to keep to your end up of the deal. Tell Sally to expect a visit. Jules please, Jules? Jules? Julian? Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. It's payday Sally. Debts must be paid. We had an agreement. But don't worry, I'm offering really easy payment. Hello? Is this your daughter? No. No it's not. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sorry to have put you through this Mrs Bryant She doesn't even look like the picture. Her hair, her skin, her freckles, don't you fucking people check? You cant keep doing this to me. I'm awfully sorry Mrs Bryant she was considered a match. If she was black would she still be considered a fucking match. Nothing is the same, her height, her weight? I'm sorry I need to leave. We can't go on like this Paul. Like what? We need to go out. Go to the cinema, go for a walk, I don't give a shit. I can't live in this prison anymore. We cant afford it Sal. But we can't afford to be like this either. We're just existing. I know. Do you know how long its been since we laughed. Watched a DVD or since you made love to me. I know. We have to face the facts. Look at me. She's either gone because she needed to. Or she's dead. I know. Paul we can't do this anymore. I know. She's gone. I know. We have to move on today or its going to be the end of us as well. I know. I love you, so much. I know. Your right, we have to start again. I know. Have you seen him over there? I know tell me about it. Do I look alright? Yeah you look good. Yeah. Seen you looking at me. Sorry? You want me don't you? You want me inside you. Do I really? Yeah. You want it. You don't know what your talking about. You know I could make you feel so good and its been ages since you felt good isn't it? What would you know? I know what I see, and I reckon you want it. *Scoffs* Carry on kidding yourself love. Really. Yeah. Your barking up the wrong tree darling. Good try though, little less direct next time. Oh so there will be a next time? No, not with me. Yeah, yeah, we'll see about that. I'm happily married. What in a sexless marriage. You think you know it all don't you. I know the face of a women who hasn't had a good fuck in years, yeah. Leave it yeah? Hey we can make this whatever you want. But you want something. No, no, no, no you need something. Even if I only give your pussy a good rub. Fuck, you serious? What will it be love? I'll have a G&T thanks and whatever this cunt wants. Same again yeah? So you buying me a drink now are you? Yeah. Because maybe with a bit of lubrication you might find yourself with some better chat up lines. Lu-bric-ation. I'm up for a bit of that, how about you? I'm lubricated enough thanks. So what we waiting for? Eight fifty please love. He'll pay. What a dick. Men Ah bless, boyfriend chuck you out? You and I got some unfinished business. Come on no struggle. I just wanted to see what you would do. More than we currently are now. Like? I want to eat you. And I want a good hard cock. Then you might just get one. I said good and hard. What your packing is neither. Hello I'm Morris. We spoke about the Jodie Bryant situation on the phone. Before we move forward. Punctuality is very important to me, do not make me ever wait for you again. Yeah traffic was terrible... Business are made and broken by attention to detail. This includes making appointments. Understood. Good, shall we move on? Do you have any issues regarding the work? No. Yes. Why you interested? The girl's parents owe me a sizable debt. Getting her back will enable them to be more together and pay what they owe. Is there a limit? No limits. Alive or dead, I need to know; I need this girl home either way. Whatever it costs is whatever it costs, I'll add the debt to the Bryants' bill. Do I get to speak to mum and dad? No, everything available, you have. You are a private detective Morris, join the dots. I have none the less pulled in a few favours and you will have a hard drive delivered to you today with all the police records. Ah now. I know thats lovely and everything, but the thing is I don't like to work with stolen stuff, dodgy stuff. You will work with whatever I proved you with or you wont work at all. If you don't find this girls ill ensure you never work again. Yeah, but look. No buts Maurice, you claim to be the best in your field now prove it. If you do the job the police and media can't, you'll be the most in-demand private investigator in the country. This could make you a very wealthy man, Maurice. Something I know certainly are not right now. My financial situation has bearing whatsoever on how good a job I do. But it helps, it helps being able to pay one's bills. I've asked around you Mr Sinclair I know your a hard man and that sort of stuff, you don't muck about so I will be giving you benefit of the doubt. You are not in a position to give me benefit of the doubt. I earn a lot of money, I give others the benefit of the doubt, nobody does this with me. This will be the making of you, Maurice, I just know it. I'm going to need some working capital. It will be along with the hard drive. I take it £10k is enough? Find the girl; use every resource at your disposal, this has gone on too long. Be very aware Morris; fiddle the figures or fuck me over and I'll make your life an absolute living hell. So she was like around for three to four days, but John felt the need to move her on. Who's John? Our boss. What do you mean move her on? Well, either she's shit, or she's so fucking hot he had to move her onto the big hitters. Thats like working with businessmen, celebrities, that sort of shit. Are you sure this is her? Look, I'd know her anywhere, she's the most professional amateur I've ever seen. Took to it like a duck in water. Her name is Jo init? I don't know. Maybe? How do I get in touch with John? You don't. Look if knows I've spoke to you he'll break my face. Look, last year, when I got picked up by the filth, didn't say a word. But John broke four of my ribs anyway. Look, you can't just walk in there and talk to John, you need to get round him somehow. Alight, here is your money. Thank You. Don't spend it all in one place. You joking? I'm pregnant again, that's where this is going. How old are you? Good question, er sixteen? Really? Oh no I might be fifteen, I lose track of dates sometimes. Angel. Your a beautiful girl, you lovely, no, your lovely. Your really beautiful and really lovely, now listen. You got to find a way out of this, I mean you don't have to be doing this you should be with someone else someone nice. It's easy to say when you have options. When you get to my stage you don't have any options. Options, you've got options. You see those fucking birds they haven't got fucking options, they're in a fucking cage. I ain't got, you got options. So start again. My dad sneaked into my room when I was nine. My life was ruined the day he touched me. Not everyone is disgusting. No they're not, not everyone is disgusting not everyone stinks. There some nice people out there and you should start meeting them. All you need is a break. You just need a good break. Are you blind? Do you walk around the street with your eyes closed? There are scumbags everywhere. And all over the country in homes, parents are fucking their children, all covering this sort of shit up. Look, just do me a favour alright? Next time your on the streets, take a good hard look. Life is shit, and when your out their you'll realise. It was nice to meet you. Sally. Sally, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. So sorry, I'm so sorry baby, I'm so sorry. I'll talk to him alrlight, I'll sort this out. I can't do this anymore. It's been five days this week and my insides are hurting. How could you let it go this far? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll sort this out, alright? I'll sort this, ill sort it. You, what did you put through my letterbox. What are you doing you fucking nutter, nothing, what's a matter with you. Whats happening? Well you better have a look. Where did this come from? I don't fucking know do I Paul? Do you know what this means sally? Yeah. It's either her or some sick fuck is trying to blackmail us. We got to destroy this. No. Because it might be a sign. A sign we do not need. We know nothing more now than what we knew this morning. What we do know is someone knows something about us. We got to get rid. Hello? Hello? Jodie is that you? Come home now yeah? I'll get you through this? I need you home. We need you home. Working late again Paul. Yeah. Any news? No, nothing. It must be so hard. Well its certainly not easy. You know thats the most you've said to me in a year. Is it? I miss you. Yeah I miss me to. We need you back Paul, she may never come back? We all miss you. Maybe its time to move forward, your both young enough you could start again? But we would have to adopt. Sally had to have a hysterectomy after Jodie they were complications. Fancy a cuppa? Nah I better get on. Oh come on. Now I never told you this they are redundancies due, and your name is banded about. You need this job. Yeah. Well I've told them all about the overtime your doing put in a good word, but I cant help you any further unless you help yourself. What do I need to do? You need to let go. Move on and up your game here. Yeah You can do it. So, Sally, tell me about your week. Usual work, stressed, random strangers shouting at me in the street. Normal week then? Hm. And sex? Still nothing, but I miss him, so much. I'm starting to wonder if jodie was the only thing keeping us together. Have you tried making the first move? Of course I have, dozens of times its fucking disastrous. Do you still suspect him of cheating? I don't think he's got it in him. I'm the one with the temptation. Really, tell me about it. I look around, I see it everywhere sex, romance. I want sex, I want it in a loving way. I want to feel like a woman again. You need to talk to Paul, the only way you can change is through clear lines of communication. I know but its hard. How you feeling about Jodie. I want to know why? It's killing us. I think we both know the answer to that Sally. I trust our conversations are always in confidence Doctor Spencer. Even if I wanted to say something I couldn't. Good, then you will remember that. Sounds like a threat Sally, you don't need to remind me of protocol. Hello Sally. Julian. It's pay day I'm afraid. Well I thought it might be, maybe try be a little nicer today, yeah? You owe me money I'm been more than nice, now get in the fucking house. This might be a little upsetting for you both, but you've got to see it. Is that your daughter on the photo? Yeah. We have very good reason to believe that your daughter may well be involved in a porn ring, that produce rape videos. Now I want you both to take your time, have a real good look, and tell me. Do you recognise any of the men in this photo? No. Mr Bryant? No. Look. I'm sorry to bring in this bombshell to your door in such a way. But this here give great hope hope that your daughter may still be alive. Which is a huge positive we must draw from this. Have you received anything? Nothing. Well we think you might. When information like this get leaked. Well there's purpose behind it. Well if we do then you'll be the first to know wont you. Much appreciated Miss, and I thank you both for your time. I can't imagine how difficult this must be for the both of you. I'll arrange a councillor to contact you as soon a possible. These things, well there best talked through. Well, good day to you both, and I'll be in touch, right. Ill see you out. Thank you, bye, bye. Yeah? Morning sir, sorry for the inconvenience I'm from the gas board we've had reports of a leak in the area. I've got to check all the properties, absolute nonsense innit eh? Well can you come back later? Now unfortunately sir, due to severity of the situation if I'm not given immediate access, I'll have to call the police. Fuck sakes, whatever come in and do whatever you got to do. Thank you sir. So how do you know there's a leak then? Well there doesn't actually seem to be one. I don't suppose you've got any other properties in the area? Yeah, got a house up the street I rent out to a couple of girls. Oh yeah, what numbers that then? Thirty three. I should really check that out as well. John Shit. Look ill just let you in yeah. The inlet is under the kitchen sink and the boiler is in the bedroom at the front. Oh and stay out the bedroom at the top because Jo's asleep So you found what your looking for? Eh? Maurice. What? Huh? No I ain't got time for you bullshit games. I know who you are and what your up to. Your in way over your head little man. Don't want to spend the rest of your miserable days on a ventilator and shitting in a bag I suggest you fuck off and stop following me around. Do you understand? I understand you. Well fucking do one then. Sally! Guess what? What? No guesss you ain't going to believe it. Well I cant guess Paul. Ten people got made redundant today, but not me I got a promotion. That promotion comes with a pay rise. A pay rise big enough to pay all of Julians costs. No more suffering it's all over, its all over. It's all over. I love you. Love you. Love you, I'll go see him now shall I? Yeah Ah Paul what an unexpected visit. I got good news. And? I've had a pay rise at work. That means I can make your monthly payments on time with interest. Well that is fantastic news, but you do know I need to be paid this month. Please mate give me a break. I'm not totally unreasonable you know but you do seem to have got off other lightly. Maybe, just maybe you could make the repayment this month? What do you want me to do? Same as Sally. What? You heard. Don't be fucking ridiculous. Don't fucking talk to me like that you soppy cunt. Okay class and thats it. Don't forget on Monday I need your essays on the pond life of urban gardens. Have a good weekend everybody. Pond life. Well that's appropriate. Haven't seen you in a while. Well you know. So how's things? We're moving on, who's the girl? Girl? Ah, her names Amy. What do you want? A chat. About what? Things. Well can you be a little bit more specific. I slept well last night, for the first time in over a year. How well do you sleep Tim. Like a baby. Like a baby? Just get to the point. I think I just did. What and thats it? Yeah. What do you want you cunt. Oh Tim, is that the best your going to do? What do you fucking want? I want nothing more than for you to know I exist, I will continue to exist. What and thats it? Yeah, like I said that's it. There's more to this. How do you feel Tim? How do you really feel? How do you mean? Do you miss us? I think of you often, but its all in the past we need to move forward with our lives, separately. They can't get much more separate can they? Look you can't just turn up for the first time in ages and try to intimidate me. I've got responsibilities. I've got a career. You've got your own concerns, so stick to your own life and stay out of mine. Our lives are intwined Tim. What do you want you fucking bitch. You should know something. What? We've received stuff. Stuff? Yeah stuff. Be more specific. We received some DVD's with some very choice imagery on. Look after yourself Tim. What's the matter? I went to see an old friend today. A friend, friend. Who? Tim Taylor What! I know. Do you not understand? We can't be the only ones to feel like this. We've suffered enough look, its time to share the burden. Don't see him again. I'm sorry, but all I can see is them swanning around living their lives freely and knowing their part of the reason of why this happened? Sally. We have to... Where's the phone sally? Hello? Is it her? She's gone, it's her. She put the phone down when she heard your voice, but. What did she say? She said she loves us. She said she's sorry, and she said she's coming home. It's definately her. Yeah. I don't like it Paul. What do you mean? DVD's, Images and now a phone call. Somethings not right Paul. You really do see the darkness in everything. I see the reality, not pink fluffy clouds like you do. So man the fuck up, look beyond the end of your nose and sort it out. I told you somethings not right. Hi guys, how we doing alright? Yeah good, you? Done your homework? Don't forget pond life of urban environments. Alright, cheers for that, thanks for that, bye. What you got planned for this weekend then? Not really much really mate, I was thinking about taking that girl out from the bookies. Oh that blonde one. The skinny blonde one. Skinny blonde one. Definitely a piece of me. This just came for you. You got to be shitting me. You alright mate? Take a look at these. One sec Wheres Kevin gone? Okay so as you can probably see he is a very powerful character. Probably someone you really want to get on the wrong side of. Sorry can you just continue to read from page seventy eight on your own, ill be back in one second. Hello there, can I help you? Mr Taylor? Yes? Hi, Kevin Donnelly from the Essex Mercury. I need to speak to you about something. Okay well I finish in about twenty minutes. It can't wait really. Okay then, what's up? I've come into the possession of some images. Images? These are images of a man clearly having sex with an underage girl. And, how can I help you? Well, these images are of you? I'm sorry? What? This is ridiculous. Take a look yourself. Look these are indeed very unpleasant photographs but, what on earth, makes your sick little head think it was me? I like body art. And? Last week, news article, sponsored swim, your tattoo. I think we better take these to the police, unless you think we can come to some sort of arrangement? Why you here? I want the story, or I want a new car. Your a sick, sick man. And you? Well I don't know what you are. Look, these images suggest but it doesn't imply anything. They're more graphic pictures. Get out of my way. So why your running away then, eh why? Your life's ruined now Tim. What you say now might go in your favour for the publics perception. Fuck perception and fuck you. I'm going to the police right now. Good now fuck off. Who was the girl? What do you expect me to say? Who and why? Her name's Amy, she's a student, why because I love her, its not wrong its just... I dont' want you to say anything you don't feel or believe. What the fuck do you care about what I want or what I feel. I want the truth. Truth? Where the fuck was your truth when you was asking for money. Don't run away cause you cant hide. Don't do it. Hello? Hi, Kevin Donnelley from the Essex Mercury. I've come into the possession of some images. Mate I'd rather install a toilet camera and look at myself straining to a bitter, nasty stubborn shite, than watch you trying to pick up a bird again. And what's that suppose to fucking mean? Can you not wait until their a little bit older. She said she was twenty. Twenty my fucking arse man. I should be knocking on your door and putting you away. You don't know what your missing mate. Maybe. Anyway watch and learn. This is how you deal with the likes of this. Do your fucking fly up man. We're professionals. Yeah, look front door is open, shall we go striaght in. No, stop. Let's see if he opens up first. Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor, police. Mr Taylor. Alright, we'll go In, but we'll go in slow right? No, no, shut the fucking door. This is what happens when you start dragging up the past Sally. It says he committed suicide. I never pressured him to do that, and how dare you even think I could do something like that. We know what your capable of. What does that mean? You know exactly what that means. I swear to you I never caused this. Maybe guilt just got the better of him. Maybe. Promise me Sally. I promise. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do you think I should call the police and tell them about Jodie. No. I don't think we should risk it. Okay. The media has died down, they're not actively looking. I say we wait until she comes home, listen to her story, and then work out what to tell the police. It's a bit early. Sorry to both you Mrs Bryant, I've been told to pop by and ask you a few quick questions if thats okay. Did you know a Mr Timothy Taylor. The guy from the paper. Aye thats right. No, I dont think I did. He was a teacher. Yeah I read that, but not at my daughters schools so why would I know him? Do you know if your daughter knew him? No of course she didnt, what a stupid question. Thanks very much for your time Mrs Bryant. We'll be in touch in a day or two. Thanks for your time? You've just come to my house to ask me questions and now your going to leave? Sorry but if you know of no real connections just helps narrow down our enquiries. Why would their be a connection? I don't have all the details Mrs Bryant, that will be all for now. Right, I'll see you out. Alright. I've just had the police round. Hello my name is Leanne Johnson I heard you've been looking for a girl called Jo. I can give you information of where she is. Is that the girl? Yeah. You sure. That's her. So. Tell me about her. She turned up about a year, year and half ago. She was young, nieve looking, but she had a way about her. She knew what it took to satisfy a client. I've done this for six years and its not the kind of stuff I would do. What sort of stuff? Scat, fisting you name it, its yours But you also get good clients, just had to be prepared for any eventuality. I can't do that. If I got back to client room and he wants double penetration with another party or parties. I'd have to step back, these people you can't step back from. Shes just a kid. Shes an adult she just looks young. No she's just a kid, shes fifteen. Fuck. Exactly. Look mate I'm not been funny but what sort of shit has this girl been through. The first time a bloke put a cock in my mouth I nearly passed out. She does some real hardcore shit. How does a fifteen year old girl get that fucked up. I dont konw. I think she was sexually abused by a teacher. Who recently committed suicide. You can't trust nobody. I left home when my step dad turned on me. If I'm going to do that shit I want money for it. But I'm sensible I own my own home, I've got kids. These two lives are separate, no body knows what I do, and I only work up town or on the coast. When you knew her, where was she? Knew her? I know her. I know everything about her. I even know where she will be Tuesday night, because that's divvy up day. Where? Are you not forgetting something? What? The price, this information comes at you for a cost. What is this worth to you? You're a streetwise kid I'll give you that. You have to be. Alright. I'll give you a thousand pounds if you can guarantee what you say is true. I will give you another three grand if you can set up a meet with her. Alright, I'm going to get you two together. Three grand should keep me straight for three months. I'll need to lie low for a bit, if I deliver this. John is the guy who runs things around here. He takes no prisoners. But I need something from you too. What? I have information on John, I need to make sure that it gets to the police. I need him out of the way. I've met John, he needs to be out the way.

If you're filth you cant finger me and arrest me, so stick your finger in. Really? Yeah. Now can we talk? You've paid now we do whatever you want? I've got a message for you, I'll give you the message and then I'll leave, and we're done and you'll never see me again. I dont like the sound of this but go ahead. Listen Jodie. Who the fuck are you? Two minutes, just give me two minutes, I'm sorry. I work for a very powerful man, your mum and dad are in big trouble. Dad? And your mum. Carry On. If you don’t go home soon, things are going to get worse. They're in a lot of trouble they owe a lot of money. Your dad has just been released on bail for attacking girls. I'm not ready yet. What you need time for? Preperation, do you know what your dealing with here? Julian, I guess? Yeah. Your way older than you years ain't you? I need to be. Can I do anything to make it easier for you to go home? No, I just need time to think, I've already paid a visit briefly. Do you need any cash? No I do alright thanks, anything else? No, thats it, you just go home. Okay, so you need to stay here for at least ten minutes, alright? Why? Because this is how it works. I leave, the punter normally has a shower. Here look, take my card incase you need to reach me. And can I ask you one last question? Go on Why? Why did you go, why are you doing this? No reasons, just because. Anyway it's time to go. Maurice? You never looked like a Pete. Jodie? Yeah? Be safe. Always. Fuck. Julian? Julian? What you got me into? Just do your job? That poor girl. This is a world you do not understand Maurice, a world you won't want to understand. Just do your job, and leave a richer man. She had kids. She was a whore, and now those kids have a better life. Yeah, I want out. Listen to me do you understand? You are in too far. We'll clean your car and return it to you in the morning. What about her? Every year people go missing, their fates never known, she is just another statistic Maurice. Look, I've done everything you asked, I've passed on that message. Look, consider yourself on retainer, until Jodie comes home. When she comes home our arrangement is at an end. Okay. Now go round the corner, and Serena, my driver, will be waiting in my car. She will bring back your car tomorrow. Okay. Maurice, one last thing. Keep your mouth shut. If you can do that then things will be okay. When did you get out? Late. And I've got to attend a police station at 6 o'clock everynight. Great, Well done. I dont know what goes through your fucking brain sometimes. Why didnt you come and see me? Because I don't want to be associated with a man who, for the last fourteen months, since his own daughter went missing, has been attacking girls with similarities to Jodie. How did you even get out? Varied circumstances apparently. I've got to see a court appointed psychiatrist one day a week. What you being charged with? Four counts of assault, one attempted murder. I denied it Sally. You fucked up. I don't know why I did it? Pressure? Shit with Julian? Well you made the fucking press. Kevin, that reporter who's meant to be helping us is now working against us. And he thinks you murdered Jodie. Fuck. Yeah, I think its safe to say you wont be going back to work either. Some bird range from the office? Simone, said to contact her first before going back to work. Who is she? One of the admin girls. Then I suggest you give her a call. Okay. Sort it out Paul. I didn't know what else to say but at least I bought you some time. Thank you. When it goes to court though, its over. They give you a date? Referred for six weeks, could be anything up to six months. And have they given you an outcome. No, well, if the murder charge gets kicked out, I will probably get a suspended sentence psychiatric assessment. I didn't try kill anyone Simone. I just miss my little girl. I don't know what to say Paul, I mean you think you know someone, then something like this happens. Where do you go from here? I'm still the same, I'm still Paul. Right, well, lets go see the bosses. Roy I cant thank you enough, my wife aswell. Thank you its much appreciated. Roy, thank you Donna, thank you very much. Safe for now. They even told me they'll help get around the curfew arrangements. I lied though Simone. I told them it was the first time, I denied all other times. Panicked didn't I can't be out of work. Alright, best you get home then. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. What's up? See for yourself. Jodie. Jodie. Oh Jodie, thank god your home. Where have you been? I just needed to get away, I just needed time to think. But I'm back, but things change from here on out. Who do you think you're talking to? You. Don't you come back after months and start barking orders. Yeah and I missed you too mum. Can we just stop this? She's home, let's just enjoy it. Okay, what story are we concocting for the police then. I'll let you two decide that one, we know the truth. We're you pregnant? Of course not I only took precautions, anyway I've had a long day and I'm tired I just need some sleep. We can talk about this tomorrow. Julian? It's Maurice, yes she's back home. Yes, about two hours ago. Wel I'm hoping this means my work is finished. Yes, and when will I get my final bit of money? Can you do a bank trasnfer? Alright thank you Julian. Yeah night. Hello? Jodie, you're home. Good, yes I can meet you tonight. Oh actually can we make it the day after I need to go to the hospital tomorrow. Yeah? Can I come in princess? Yeah. How are you feeling? Relaxed. Sorry I was a bit harsh last night. No, It's alright. Have you got a story? I'll just say I needed time away to think. Just needed to get away. I cant believe your home. It has been such a long time. She's out there. Anyway so, great to have you back. Morning, how are you feeling? Fine. Great. Then let's get downstairs get the story straight and call the police. I need the loo first. Okay, so where did you go and why have you come back? Hmm why the fuck do you think? You stupid bitch. Jodie. Sorry dad. Well. I had to get away. This whole thing, it's sick, it's wrong, I just had to get away, alright? I've been out there, I know how the world works. We can get round this if we stick together. If I go, I'm not coming back again. What we going to tell the police Paul? What about you ran away with a boyfriend? Plauseable Great, so where did you go and why did you come back? He was European, and he tricked me into leaving and kept me almost kept me like a hostage. I dont know how you come up with these fucking stories. Hm, I wonder. Anyway call the police, come one, I just want this over with. Interview resumed, for the benefit of the video I am DCI Reece Duttomn I am conducting this interview with DC Claire Coogan. And we are talking with one Jodie Bryant, and her parents Paul and Sally Bryant. Jodie, do you know a Timothy Taylor? No. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. On September twenty eighth, we were called to twenty seven Western Road to investigate a case of child abuse. The perpetrator committed suicide by elaborate means upon arrival. When we searched his hard drive, we found a number of images. Does this bring back any memories? Listen Jodie, I know this is hard, but we have lots of images of Mr Taylor with lots of different people. We need to know how he got people to have sex with him, and how you met him? Jodie, if you want to leave all of this all in the past and forget about it you can, okay? If you don't mind me saying, Mr Bryant, you seem remarkably calm for a man who has just discovered an adult has been having sex with his daughter. My daughter has been missing for nearly 18 months and now shes home. Obviously she left for a reason. We might never understand what happened in that time. Quite frankly I don't care. That man is dead he cant hurt Jodie or anyone else. So please, can we do this another time? No, Mr. Bryant, we can't do this another time, you see, there are other images. What? Other images? Jodie do you want to tell us anything? No. Whoa! Shit the bed. Well hello. It's 7 a.m. what you doing here? What are you doing here? Well I'm meant to be here. Well your daughters home, should you be with her? No, she's catching up with her friends. Oh, well it must be lovely to have her home. Yes. Yes it really is. I feel like that pressure is lifting a bit. Okay, well I better get on with my work. Yeah. Catch you in a bit. Sure. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. What you doing in here? Looking for you. You shouldn't really be here. I should. Come on this is silly. Stop. No. Yeah, fucking stop. Simone, I love my wife. I don't care. I've been flirting with you for months now, I do you favours; and fucking sorting you out, what's in it for me? Well, can't we just be friends? I want something back. Like what? Sex, just once. No, I cant do that. I want you inside me. Comply with me and everything goes back to normal. Defy me, and I'll tell the police you attacked me. You what? No=one is here for the next ninety minutes so sit the fuck down. I don't fucking feel right about this. Right?, Fucking Right? Yes, I've wanted you for three fucking years now, since the Christmas party; you led me on. And ow you're attacking girls, for some sort of sexual kick no doubt. Well I've got a little kick for you, yes that's right, I'll even struggle if you like. You don't feel very excited to me Paul. I cant do this I thought we was fucking friends. Get some fucking balls and get this hard now. I can't do it, please. Just fuck me, yeah? No. Yeah you fuck me, or I'm going to fucking fuck you. Fuck off. Oh Paul, look what you've done. I'm so sorry Simone. Police it is then. You cant do this to me. I can do whatever I fucking like yeah, because your on bail and your life is in my hands. You had your chance. And you fucked it. Now fuck off. Jodie Who the fuck are you? I'm Kevin I work at the Mercury. Oh, so your the guy who slammed my dad right? Thats my job, I also found time to look for you though. Whats it like been back? None, of yor business. Come on lets be friends. Lets not, I'm a bit picky who I chose as a friend. It's not what I've heard. That's the sort of glib comment that we'll never be friends. Glib, your ahead of your years. Well some of us grow up and not play around pretending to be journalists. You have a smart mouth. Well at least I have orignality. I can help you? I don't need help. That's not what I see, I've got some lovely videos of you Jodie. We know what you've been up to. You know nothing. Tim Taylor. Police already have it all. Not all of it, I kept the best bits, best stuff. You've been through the ringer. What you doing? You need to talk I need a lift get in. You have a way about you. Come on time is money and my friends hate waiting. I'm home. Did you have a good day? What do you care? I'm interested, course I care. If there is anything you need to speak about you know I'm always here. Go on, go up stairs and get ready for dinner. Oh, no, no, no. Hello Jodie, I'm Colin, and I hear you like to suck lollipops. Good, girl. My head is all bruised Paul, you'll have to make this up to me tomorrow. Stay the fuck away from me. Oh don't be like that Paul I thought we had an understanding? Fuck off.

Well fuck her then? I did, I had to. Now she wants it to carry on. You do what you need to sweetheart, because we need people on our side until your case is done. Okay. Do you want to see something that might lighten the mood. What? I got a disk, I thought it might spice things up considering we haven't had sex in over a year. A Jodie disk? She agreed? I didn't give her a fucking choice, we will have two new disks by tomorrow and we can start uploading them. Okay. Everything is getting back to normal. I'm so happy. Come on. Calm down big boy, I don't want you firing off before I get a look in. I can't believe you fucked that cunt. Keep your voice down. Your breaking my heart. Soon, it'll all be over soon.

Sorry I forgot to mention I booked in another client for today. That's six hundred quid she's made us this afternoon. I don't want to do it. I couldn't give a shit what you want, get up there. Hello, I'm Gary. Hello Gary, nice to meet you. Hi Maurice, so what you got? Jodie, this is John. Nice to meet you. And you. So what's the story? I lost my job two months ago down the factory, my boss was Julian. About four months ago he started picking on one of our new kids; sixteen years old, just out of school. Let me guess. Shh. Anyway, it's late one night and I'm getting out later than normal and I hear crying. I look down one of the bits of plant and saw Julian trying to suck this kid off. I pulled Julian off him and got the kid safe. The following day we were called to a meeting and we were all made redundant. Well theres a legal issue here. He shut the factory down and rebranded it. Doing the same thing but under a new name. Well at least you spared another innocent, right? No we never, three days later Julian got the kid at a nightclub and raped him. The kid later withdrew his statement, but apparently has been spending a lot of cash. So what can we help you with? We want him. Who? Julian. We can deliver him. Or vice-versa. Nice. Good night Kevin. Alright see you on monday. I'm sorry. About the pub stuff. Yeah I thought you might be. What was it you offered to do to me again?

What are we waiting for, can't we just go now? We can't I've got a couple of lose ends to tie up first. You're so grown up now, it's like I hardly know you. What happened when you was away? Look, If I'm going to be turned into a whore, I want the money. Okay? You two were happily living off my work. It's only fair I saved the money, got our freedom, and now planned our escape. This needs to end now. Hi, Maurice? Oh, thats great news. Okay, yeah brilliant, thanks. Whats that? That's the pimp dealt with, just a couple more bits to tie up now.

It's a neuromuscular blocking agent, it's a paralytic, it takes days to wear off. But all you can do now is sit and watch. It's like been trapped in a prison, a bit like how I felt. Come in. Hello, boss. Me and one of the boys thought we would come and pay you a visit, because I know you like fucking people. We thought you'd like a taste of your own medicine. I'd say hold him down, but you can't move, can you? You better go love. No, I think I'll stick this one out for a bit. Hello? Hi Sally, how're you feeling? Good Clive, how can I help?

Now, now Maruice I only wanted to be your friend. What do you want? Five, should do it. Five? Five what? Thousand. And if I dont pay? The images will go to the police. My story, my paper. I thought, with all these characters out of the way, I might just see this world in a different way. She's still out there. I'm going to her next and I bet that will be a good pay off. On that side, I can at least be happy, I suppose. So then, what we going to do about this? When did you realise whre the story was going? About a day before the teacher was killed by jodie. And you decided to just sit on it. She needed protection, she trusted me. You should never trust the press. You're disgusting. That's what the teacher said right before he was killed, she had such an agenda. I've obviously lived a very sheltered life. So, cash or the cops? Niether. What? Maurice, what are you doing? I don't want to live in this world anymore. Maurice, slow the fucking car down. I don't want to be a detective, I want do a new job. What you gonna do. Fucking pest control.
