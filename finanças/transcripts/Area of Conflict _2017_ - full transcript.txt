Subtitles by explosiveskull It was one of those days. It was definitely one of those days. I hate those days. Was yesterday your birthday? Looks more like your friends. Well, you threw a party. Watch this. - The party's over. - Let's go. Eagle's Nest. This is Archangel. Do you copy? Did he put you on hold? ETA over head, one minute. You said that an hour ago, you ass. Sorry, Archangel. I'm gettin' a little tired of this shit, Skip. You know what our problem is, don't you? Please enlighten me. We keep comin' back. But I like that part. Archangel, heavy load inbound on mark. Negative, not on mark. What? Cossidy, five, zero, zero, over. Traffic load on mark. In five, four, three, two. Archangel. Archangel, come in. Archangel, come in, over. Well, he's here. What ever gave you that idea? You know, it's a soldier thing. I can sense it. Roger, honey. Will you make the bad thing go away? Don't worry, Mindy'll get it. I thought you were Mindy. Oh, hi Tony. Roger's asleep. He told me to tell you he's not here. My bad. God, what was I thinking? It's like the crack of three. Come in. Eyes above deck, soldier. We're here, you know, when in Rome. Oh, you poor bastard. You must hate your life. Hey, Tony. Roger. Roger? Roger! It's time to wake up and go to work. You gave me two weeks off. Yeah, and it's been three weeks. Whatcha been up to? Yeah, all play and no work makes for bad business, buddy. Time to go. Who invited us to what dance? The question I've been waiting for you to ask. Your ex-uncle. - What? - Don't worry. There won't be any army brass or any politics, I swear. We don't... Just because we're not working for them doesn't mean we can't take referrals. Fine. Tony, you really should come visit us more often. There's a good idea. Five minutes. He say five minutes? That is not long enough. One of them's like the good one, and one of them's the evil one, right? You got a guy here who's on his third divorce. She took everything fun from me. I live vicariously through you. That bitch actually took the ice cube trays from the freezer, didn't she? Ah ha ha. Who's the guy we're meeting? His name is Carter. He works for a big military subcontractor. He's a problem with one of the countries we helped liberate a few years ago. You may have to narrow that down a little bit. It's north of the Stands, west of the Iron Curtain. Think Kosovo. It's civil war, genocide, under duress, the usual shit. - Oh yeah, one of them. - Yeah. Oh, thank you, darling. Thank you. When in Rome, go with it. You had enough. All right, it's time to shape up. I'll handle the introductions, okay? Anthony Carter, I'd like to introduce you to Roger Steinrich, and of course, you remember the delightful and lovely Heather. Yes, Miss Cartwright. Pleasure to see you again. Good evening, Mr. Carter. It's good to see you. I've heard a lot about you. You seem like you might be the right man for the job. You have a little problem for me to solve. Well, I'm sure your colleagues have already briefed you, but yes, my company was contracted by the local government to assist in setting up a certain infrastructure, security. Some folks used to call it nation building, before those became dirty words. The past six months, a criminal gang has knocked off quite a large number of our people. And the local UN can't help? Yeah. Well, they're just there as observers. The blue hats, they don't like to shoot guns. And you thought it a brilliant idea to outsource this little problem to us, because? Because the lovely Miss Cartwright did a good job of selling us on your team. Did she now? That woman will say the strangest things. Are there any more questions? When do you need us to leave? Tomorrow, assuming the captain isn't too hungover. I'm good. Or as soon as you can round up your team. - All right. - Time to go. Any chance we could just start by hiring the bad guys like we used to? Yeah, no problem. Have a good evening. Here you go, guys. - Thank you, miss. - You're welcome. Here's your ginger ale, hon. Thank you, darlin'. Ginger ale? Hold it. Wait, wait, wait. What exactly in this good book of yours is to say you can't drink with your buddies no more? Remember the bond, the brotherhood we had? We used to tear this city down. It's not that specific, Red, and besides, there's drinking, and there's gettin' drunk. Aren't you the intellectual? You guys, what's the matter with Blondie there? Newbie. Can't hold a beer anymore? Don't you still need a training manual to hold your pecker? Pecker. At least I don't need a penicillin every month to hold it. Shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get out of here, Newbie. - Just a kid. - You're right. Maybe it's something that we say? Hell no. Not at all. Oh, they're not even fighting. - Thank you, but... - Give it time. Give it time, we just got here. Always a show. That's what I like to see, a little conviction! Look, if you're trying to piss me off, you succeeded. Congratulations, you did it. Leave me alone. Blondie, I was tryin' to see if you still got the balls to do what we do. Trust me, Red. You don't. Why is that, altar boy? Hey, Chase. Hey, sweetheart, how are you? Better now that you're here. Told you. - Some things never change. - Never do. Oh, there it is. Oh, I told you it wouldn't take longer than two minutes. It took them longer than usual. - They're maturing. - They're getting better. It's on. Come on, fuckin' jar head. You need to watch your ass. I'm a ranger, tough guy. What are you gonna do? That's what I'm gonna do! Get off him! Dumb son of a bitch! Shall we get the car? - Come on! Who's left? - Oh yeah. Oh. Frickin' Newbie. What's up, Blondie? - Hey, Skip. - Hey, boys. - Hey, Skip. - Hey, guys. We thought you were gone playin' with the twins. Thanks, Doc. If you gentlemen are done playing around, we got a little work to do. Pile up. All right, guys, you heard Skipper. Get in here. All right, Newbie's first bar fight. Popped his cherry. Just gettin' warmed up. Where we headin' next? Airport. Twist him like a jar head. So long, boys. And remember to stay clear of the Danish UN contention. Always room for one more, brother. Yeah. Part of me misses this. Roger that. Roger what? Boris. Boris. Boris. Boris. Commander. He stepped on landmine. I need help. Commander. Commander? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Commander! Play something a little more cheerful. We're not going to die. So, we back out here to get the same ole bad guys as usual or what? It's what the man said. So, back home in time for supper? Hoorah. - What? - Hoorah? I don't know about you kids, but I hope we get to stick around a little bit. I wanna play. Too much violence in civilian life. Well, I'm with Blondie on this one. I just wanna go home. Let's get this thing done, yeah? What, are you gettin' old, Skip? Yeah, a drunken, oversexed lifestyle. It's rough. Wakin' up in a puddle of your own vomit every day is hell on the feeding, Bill. Better to burn up, then fade away, brother. I was thinkin' maids in shorter skirts. Brother, what kinda operation do you think I'm running here? My maids don't have skirts. You guys are foul. Foul? Who the fuck says "foul," Blondie? Okay, that's repulsive. Is that better? Is that okay? Repulsive. Well, you guys, actually, you are a little foul. You got that right. We have dry feet. One minute to drop. Showtime, boys. Blondie, sure hope you brought God with you, 'cause I don't know if you looked down, because he sure as hell ain't here. There, Chase, there. You know these things will kill ya? What, do you wanna live forever? I couldn't stand the company. Hey, y'all smokin' back there in my bird? God damn is it hot. Gosh darn. Don't take the Lord's name in vain. Well, he did pick the biggest God damn gun in the arsenal. It's the best thing the German's ever made, granddaddy of 'em all. You'll be thankin' me later. What you got, Skip? Two clicks that way over that hill. Seems to be where all the fun happenin' to be happenin'. Let's go say hello. Let's go say hello. Lead the way, kiddo. What do you got? I don't know, but I feel like something's watching us. How long? Not sure. About an hour, hour and a half. Where? Up there on the ridge. Hey, what are they doing? What do you guys think, ambush? Who in the hell's these guys think they are? No, no guys. What's out there ain't no man. We're all gonna die. Come on. Flash! Get where? Backtrack, thinking. Roger that. Come check this out. No! Doc! Booby trap. Doc, how's he doin'? He's messed up, skip. Patch him up, ready to travel. What do you got? It's gonna sound crazy, but I smell soap. Soap? Yeah, soap. Please, don't lose it on me here. Brother, I'm tryin' not to. This way, 3:00. Go light. Thor. This way, on me. Blondie, go top side. You got 'em. Doc, get him moving. Come, we gotta get out of here, man. Hey, good boy. What the fuck happened? There was an IED. Keep with us, buddy. Good call. You think? Everybody okay? Anybody hit? I'm good. I'm good, Red. Contact! Son of a bitch! Fall out. Right, go left. Okay, Skip. You're the one supposed to patch us up, Doc. What the fuck is this? What'd you find? It doesn't make sense, Skip. I found tracks. They were small. Kinda like a 90 pound little kid. We saw child soldiers in Africa. This isn't it. These guys are too clever for that. I don't want to think a bunch of kids are gettin' the best of us, Skip. What's up? I smelled soap out there again. All right, I believe you. You got this? Yeah, I got it. All right. Criminal gangs aren't this organized. Really, these motherfuckers were trained. This shit just doesn't make sense. Not a body, nothing. Hey, listen, we ain't ever lost a man in a mission. We put everything we had at 'em. Hey, Red, can you look up there? Lone sentries, no mercy one, radio check, over. Nothing. These mountains are blockin' my signal. We gotta get outta here. Our guys aren't gonna last much longer if we don't get help. All right, tomorrow morning, you and I go top side. Call in for a pick up. You take the wounded out to the LC, get them out of here, and then we get these motherfuckers. - Hooah. - Hooah. Shit, move it! Red, top side. There's a small motor round. Those fuckers are close. Chase, Thor, Get these out of here. Relocate them to map point 12. Go. Come on, Newbie, get up. Newbie, we're gonna go home. Let's go, Doc. Thor. Come on, Doc. Stop, Red. - What? - Stop. This is not the way. There's only one set of tracks, I swear to Christ. No, this is wrong. No, we're goin'. Let's go. This is not right. Something's wrong here. What the fuck is this? All right. On three. Yeah. One. Shot in the ass, what the fuck? Red, you good to go? Can you guys make it to the LC? Yeah. Yeah, we can get there. I'm gonna kill all of them. I'm planning on it. We will come back for him. You know that. So, you guys, top side, yeah? Yeah. So, what do you think, Skip? I think this is somebody who grew up here, who knows everything we know. Sure. Why us, though? We've come to kill 'em, didn't we? You actually sound like you admire these guys. We're pretty good at this. We're really fuckin' good at this. Damn right. Somebody got all of us, without us even getting a visual. I'm dyin' to meet these guys. Let's kill 'em and stuff 'em. Hoorah. - All right, ready? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, God. I got you. I got you. Skip, I didn't see him. I'm sorry. That's all right. Don't you worry. I'm sorry I didn't see it. I'll get you out of here. Fuck, no. This is the road to the Valhalla for me, captain. Only one. Oh, fuck. Get these guys, captain. Fuckin' get 'em. Last time, we go home. - No. - Soldier. No, saw a lot of bad shit in my day. Better to burn out than fade away, right? Right? Look, take this. Get out of here, captain. Fuck. This was it. All right. Now, it's my turn. Now, I do it my way. That's the soap. Who the fuck are you?! You have got to be kidding me, lady. Yeah, go over there, cowboy. Say goodnight, lady. So, what is your story, anyway? Oh, you're gonna tell me why. What'd you tell them, Alex? Perhaps this will help. I'll take her life away. Mom! Nice and young still in body. Look over there. Look at them. What the fuck did you tell them?! I told them nothing. Think they're all lying. Maybe we should just kill them. Sdanka! Leave. Put your gun down, little girl. Get the hell away from my family. You're a little farm girl. Put the gun down. Come to work for us. Now! We'll do this your way. I'm ready. You shot up my team. Why? Why? Lady, you started this war. You killed my family. I didn't kill your family. We've never been here before. Okay, then, cowboy. Shoot me. I don't shoot unarmed women. Who says I'm unarmed? You Americans come in here trying to make peace, and all you do is leave death behind. What the hell's that have to do with anything? That's not who we are, and that's not what we do. You seem to know how the world works, my friend. All right then, cowboy. Pull the trigger if you can. They were my friends. What is wrong with you? You can't do it, can you? Stop. Stop it. Enough. I'm not here for you. I'm here for some bad guys. You are the bad guys. No. I'm not. Listen, I lost my family, too, okay? How? We do stupid things, yeah? Listen, I'm just a guy trying to figure this out. Things happen. You wanna tell me about this? No. You're pretty handy with that thing. My dad taught me. I'm sorry. Son of a bitch. Psst. He's out here. Stop. I know you. Weak little girl. Too much for the big gun at her. Let me get a good look at her. It's the girl from the village. Ah, yes. I do know you. Thought we killed you. Well, then, I guess it doesn't matter what we do to you now, does it? You cost me a lot of men and a lot of money there, sweetheart. Gunnar, take her back, find out what she knows, and this time, make sure she's dead when you're done. Take her to my office. Fuck. Is there anything I can get you? My knives would be nice. Is Katje still alive? Let's talk about Katje. How would you like to be with Katje again? You and I could let bygones be bygones. Work for me, I can get Katje back for you. My family is not a bygone. Don't you mail order bride me, you son of a bitch. Three feet above your head is where your sister hung and bled until she was so fucking rotten that the dogs wouldn't eat her fucking corpse. It's me. Let me have her first. Maybe you'll do better than I did. She's all yours. At least you get to know that your sister's still alive before you die. Time to get to know you better. Oh, little, little girl. Such a shame that I must kill you now before I have a chance to fuck you. Little girl. Why are you helping me? Let's get this off of you, okay? You look like you could use a little help. I don't remember asking for help. Revenge is not a good thing, but it may not be a bad thing either. Just don't get in my way, cowboy. Whatever you say, cupcake. So, before my sudden headache set in, I believe you were about to tell me what was going on around here. They came with the local militia after the war. Lied to some girls, force others to work. I heard my father told some of the UN soldiers the girls that left never came back. Big guy with the hat caught her, he was here before? Yes, when they killed my family. Oh. Now, I would love to share that information with the rest of the world. Roaming charges may kill me on this. Hey, Rog. What's happenin', man? What the hell's goin' on? Did you kill them all already? Yeah. It's a she. No, it's a girl, brother. What? Wait till I tell Carter there's a girl that's been givin' you a hard time. Yeah, I'll be sure to tell him that just before I put a bullet in his head. What? Brother, he is gone way up to his knees in all kind of shit 'round here. It's them. I'll call you right back. Rog. Bonjour. Rog, hey man, you hung up on me. Oh, man, we're in a gun fight. Brother, there's much I don't know. I need a little help over here. Okay, all right, boss, where are you? Shit. Shit, I'll follow. Rog. Rog, where are you? Try this. Look's like you could use some help up here. What'd you find? Traps of the Americans. One dead body. Trails of blood headed through the west, and two sets of tracks headed to the village. God damn, she got 'em all. And now, she's got help. We gotta talk to the boss. What'd you find out? One dead body, - blood trails everywhere. - Shit. I think she's got help. All right, here's what I want you to do. I want you to go out there, and I want you to tell them that we'll pay them $50,000, and we'll get 'em a green card for the person who kills them both. You got it? Green card to the center of my ass? To Starbucks. Everybody loves Starbucks. Listen up! $50,000 and a green card to whoever gets this bitch, dead or alive! Go! So, why are you really here? I grew up in a small country in Europe, you know, the kind of place where your parents want you to be a doctor, but when I moved to America, I thought the right thing to do would be to serve my country. So, you a soldier? No. Not anymore. Mercenary, then? I don't do this for money. I don't do this for just anybody. I have to be a cause, or a way to do the right thing. The right thing? Do you know what that is? It's a little bit like female intuition. Female intuition? We have that, too. Your English is really good. Better be. Yeah? My father saved his whole life to be able to give me the possibility of complete freedom, and he sent me a school in America and offered me the world, and wanted me to see it, and I chose to come back once he got sick and watch my parents grow old. That's a nice picture. Hey, so, let me ask you somethin'. When all of this is over, then what? Only American movies end well. Confirm. Man, I just don't understand how our intel could have been that wrong. Maybe it wasn't. I'm not saying that Roger's been lying to us, Tony, but... I have never seen that man crack under pressure. He's also never lost an entire squad to a lone gunman, let alone a woman. For a guy like Roger. I don't know, I just don't buy it. Something's fishy. I'm gonna call a couple friends of mine in D.C. and see if I can check into this Carter guy. You know what? I'll do it. I know some people. Thanks. Dinner tonight? Chow mix's in the kitchen. Hey there, cowboy. I thought I lost you. My name is Roger. Hey, cowboy. Okay. I say when it's time. Okay. That's it? In the cities, the girls jump at the chance to work in the West, but here, it is now like you said. Trust, there are many rumors, many stories. Well the problem with that bitch isn't helpin' any. Double the offer. Tell them we might not be able to protect them or their families for much longer. This time we will ask and even say please. Next time we just take. Go. What took you so long? Three guys and a facial. What do you think? Smart ass. So, can I assume you got everything under control, Smith, finally? We should be on a roll in about an hour. All right, look, I will take care of all the loose ends state side. Think we can send Gunnar out to see if we can find the bodies? No, who gives a shit? Dead or alive, doesn't matter. There are new fields for us to harvest elsewhere, my friend. See you in an hour. I got this. Are you always such a showoff? You always wait an hour before you take a shot? You always wait an hour before you take a shot? So, your name is? Maria. All right. Get out. Knock knock. Welcome to Eastern Europe. Come on. Get up. Come on. Where are you going? Come here. I'm not finished with you yet. What the hell are you? Fucking Russians. I hate this place. All right. Baby, don't be shy. Come here. Don't. Hey! What the fuck was that? Gunnar, get some guys. Let's go. Go, go, go. Come on, cowboy, stop playing. You really know how to get in trouble, don't ya? More steel. - Layman. - Yeah. Who would've thought one woman could be such a nuisance? This is where you story ends. All right, this is not how you impress a lady. So, you wanna do this right, man? I am tired of this. Well, this neighbor has gone to shit. I'm so tired of you fuckin' Russians. I need this. I do. You only think you do. Do you have a family? I asked whether you have a family. An ex-wife and a daughter. What do you care? If someone told you they had been killed by someone, someone like you, would it matter to you? I haven't seen them in 10 years. Why should I care? Hey, cupcake. Finish it, okay? It's finished. What about him? Holy shit. Well, now that place is really a pile. Come on. I see. You drive like shit, you know that? Sue me. What are you waiting for? The fire to catch up with the, exploding things. Don't worry about it. There's only so many places a guy like him can hide. We'll get him. So, you still wanna help? What kinda guy do you take me for? You want me to answer that? No. First, I think we should have a little holiday. A holiday? Holiday, room service, spa, massage. Like in the movies. Like in the movies, yeah. Besides, cupcake, you need a facial. You look like hell. Oh, so is that how you get the American girls to sleep with you? It works the time. It's not gonna work on me. I hope you know that. It usually works for me. Sweaty, dirty, hot. Sure it will. The facial won't work. The dirt is fine. You could've asked, you know? Oh, fine, do it your way. Fine, I'll do it my way. Don't call me again. Don't worry. Really, every time? Somebody has to help you out. Let me get one. I wouldn't say I'm concerned or worried. I have my team with me. They are the best of the best. So, are you gonna buy me dinner afterwards? Real men cook. You do the dishes. I can deal with that. You have a dishwasher, right? Of course. Moving target, 10 points. Let me tell you something. If I needed to call the Pentagon, I'd do it. If I need to call the CIA, I do it. If I need to call the White House, he takes it. Well, of course, I figured they'd come after me. I mean, it comes with the territory. What, tomorrow? Really? We will be ready for them. Yeah? You are such a showoff. This is gonna be fun. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Cheers. Come on, answer the damn phone. Probably laying down, taking a nap somewhere. You have got to be kidding me. Just have a great day, prick. Why don't you come to work for us? There's something I need to do first. I heard. Your sister, right? Maybe we can help you with that. That sounds a little too much like free work to me. Tony. I'm just kiddin'. Maybe after, you can come intern for us. Intern? I heard about that internship thing. Is that where I work and you don't pay? Don't you Americans call that sex? You two have fun with yourselves. I got somethin' I gotta go do. Come by for a drink after, okay? Will do. Be careful. You have some good friends. He's a good guy. Is this where the room service thing comes in? Yeah, this is where the room service comes in. Whoa, Heather. Relax, it's just me. You nearly scared me to death. So much for romantic surprises. Well, a girl can never be too careful. So, what are you doing here, anyway? I thought you and Roger are flying in tomorrow. Yeah, last minute change of plans. You know Roger. So, when are you planning on moving in on Carter? We already did. Stupid bastard. I bet he never saw it coming. Probably not, considering we told him we were coming tomorrow. So, you saw me there. I wasn't sure until just now. There's a bag in the other room filled with 500,000 good reasons to forget this ever happened. Are you interested? You know me, Heather. What do you think? Come. Join me. Subtitles by explosiveskull
