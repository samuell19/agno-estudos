DOOR OPENS The fire... I need to know if Tommy's all right! We're finding out all we can. RECORDER BEEPS DS Foden interviewing Jean Slater at 9.15am. Miss Slater, we've had a tip-off about Class B marijuana, grown at No 31 Albert Square. Your address. Correct? No comment. Have you been growing marijuana? No comment. Your house is being searched as we speak. So... ..are you quite sure there isn't anything you want to tell me? No comment. RECORDER BEEPS DOOR OPENS DOOR CLOSES FLOORBOARDS CREAK Oh! You all right, Mother? Yeah. Annie... Meet your Nana Shirl. Not another name from a poxy musical? Well, you could have helped us choose, but you weren't about, were ya? The doctor thought it was adorable. Said he couldn't understand why he didn't see more Annies! I don't mean it. She's lovely. Right, I'm going to go get her some nappies and baby stuff and whatever she needs. What's up with her? She's worried about Phil. Don't stress over it. Just plot up. Sit here and worry about Max, you mean. I'm going to make sure she gets the right nappies. Relax. How is he? He's stable. KAT SIGHS I was standing there last night, and I thought he was just going to die right in front of me... ..but you know kids, they bounce back. So they've discharged you? Yeah. My lungs feel like I've been smoking 20 a day, but... Thank you. That don't seem enough... Thank you. You'd have done the same for me. In fact, you can. Don't come to court today. Let me have Scarlett. Everybody has got me wrong! I know I've done stupid things, I know... ..but when it really matters, like yesterday, THAT is who I am! I love Scarlett! Yeah, but loving her ain't the same as being her mum! What says devoted mother better than running into a burning building? All right, I don't know how to sew nametags into her PE kit... ..but I would do anything for that girl. Please! You've got your kid. Just let me have mine. I'm only going to ask you this once. Be straight with me. I know you've got form. Did you start the fire? I am sick of him making a mug out of me. I went round there to ask him to help me get Tina back, and he wouldn't... ..so I hit him, but that's all I did, I swear! I must have knocked something over. It's all right, it's all right... It's not all right, Mick! There were two kids in there. It's not your finest hour... ..but the kids are all right. Phil's all right. To be fair, I thought his gaff needed redecorating anyway, so... Too soon? It's not just Phil. Go on. The garage was full of it. Mo planted it... ..and you know what Jean's like, she just wanted to put her hands over her eyes and wait for the fairies to come and take it! Slow down, what was in the garage? Weed. She's got nicked for selling weed, and it was me that did it! She wanted to get rid of it! Say if she goes to prison, Mick? She was helping me get that money for Tina! I told you that was a scam! You should've told me! You shouldn't have had to go through this on your own. If Jean didn't get her hands dirty, the Old Bill have got nothing on her, all right? Anyway... ..Annie wants a cuddle from her fire-starting, drug-dealing Nan, so... ..come on. You'll be relieved to hear Tommy Moon's in a stable condition. We've searched your property and found evidence of a growing facility, plus a serious amount of cash. It's... SHE MUMBLES Excuse me? The money. It's for Stacey. Well, it's been seized as evidence, so Stacey can't have it. Fine! Take it, then! Take the lot! You're under arrest, Miss Slater, you can't just leave. This is nonsense! I'll be dead before you can put me in prison! I have terminal cancer, Detective! So, if you have an ounce of human decency, you will let a dying woman get some ... Oh! SHE BREATHES HEAVILY I need a doctor in here! I mean, it's Jean! Why would anybody think Jean was a drug dealer? Maybe I should try calling Kat again. No, Tommy's in hospital. She's got enough on her plate. Is it my fault? Lily, we're having a grown-up conversation right now. Look, I didn't mean for Nanny Jean to get in trouble. What? I only took a bit. The drugs you had were Jean's?! I told Ruby! I thought you knew. I found them in her garage. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to upset you. I guess Jean was growing it for pain relief, you know, I'm sure she didn't mean for Lily to find it... ..but she's your little girl. I knew how angry you would be. This is not on you, sweetheart, I promise. Come on. Let's let your dad calm down. You really are a hero, aren't you? Well, hero's a big word. No, Tiff's right. You were really brave. We're proud of you. Apparently Tommy's going to be all right. That's what matters. Phil said. Oh, she bought you the posh ones. So, tell me, did your life flash before your eyes? He reckons that the fire started in the kitchen, you know. Someone throwing a tea towel or something on the hob. Poor Kat. I know what it's like to nearly lose a child... Poor Kat? I'm the one that doesn't have her child! If you'll excuse me... ..biscuits aren't going to get my daughter back! I was protecting Lily! If I came to you with every little thing, she would never trust me! Little thing?! I'm sorry if trying to be a good step-mum was a mistake! No, I get why you didn't tell me last week. But why weren't you honest with me last night or this morning? Jean's the one growing a cannabis farm in her garage! Why are you shouting at me? I'm not shouting! Well, you're accusing me of lying! I'm not the reason she was arrested. I didn't say you were... ..but someone was, and that is what I don't get, because everybody loves Jean. Look, I get that you're worried about her... And I'm sorry, I should have told you about Lily, but I was just thrown by what happened at Phil's. You know? It took me straight back to when I was a kid and my house burnt down. Rubes... Just promise... ..there is nothing else you're not telling me? I promise. It was hot... ..and frightening, and my life flashed before my eyes, but I didn't care about what happened to me. DOOR OPENS I only cared about saving Tommy and Scarlett's lives. I'm sorry. Smoke inhalation. I think we get the picture. And Ms Slater can corroborate the story. Apologies for the lateness, Your Honour. Both kids were in hospital last night. Tommy still is. Ms Butcher. Your actions yesterday certainly speak of your love for your daughter, but they have absolutely nothing to do with this case. You have been absent from Scarlett's life for a number of years, and this court has heard disturbing stories of you using her as bait for your criminal activity when she was in your care. Your Honour, I have changed! Ms Slater has kindly offered to take Scarlett in. Is that still the case? She's family and has a record of fostering. I'm confident she'll give Scarlett the safety and stability she needs. Use what happened yesterday to turn your life around. Stay out of trouble and we'll review this arrangement in six months. Court adjourned. I'll look after her, I promise. Poison her against me, more like! Yesterday I saved your son's life and today you take away my daughter. Where is the justice in that? HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Sorry. Oh! I didn't mean to scare you. Little one all right, yeah? Absolutely fine. And, um... ..thank you. If you hadn't been here... Look, about yesterday... Look, she's my niece... ..and I can't... I won't do something that's not in her best interests. All right, I love my brother, but I know what he's like. I know what he's put Rainie through with Abi. She's better off here. Safe. I'm not going to tell Max. Right, you've got my word on that. You're a good man, Jack. You two have been through enough already. I don't even know why you're here. Worried I'm going to go on the run? No comment. Very funny. You've got sceptical eyes, Detective. Like my Sean. As if the worst thing in the world would be just to believe someone when they told you something. I wanted to avoid all this. Hospitals. Endless tests. I wanted just to live... ..as long as I could. Jean, come through. I know what you're going to say. Just spit it out. We can talk in my office. Why does no-one ever listen to me? Just tell me I'm dying! Jean... ..you are not dying. You do not have cancer. Today's scan and biopsy show the lump is benign. We sent you a number of letters. The symptoms you're experiencing are most likely the result of stress. Thinking you were ill has made you ill. Apart from that... ..you're perfectly healthy. DOOR SLAMS How's Tommy doing? Well, he won't be playing football any time soon. Look, you couldn't have known they were in there. This ain't your fault. The DI wants to look into it. She'll be wanting to speak to whoever hit you. She'll be lucky. Do you know? I just thought that... Look, if it's going to get you into trouble, then obviously I'm not going to say anything, but... It was Shirley. Admiring your handiwork? Why aren't you locked up yet? I don't want any trouble. No? Well, I don't want vicious old grannies setting fire to people's houses, but then we don't always get what we want, do we, Shirley? Do you all know it was Shirley that started the fire? Almost killed my daughter and Kat's son! Yeah, that's it! Walk off! COWARD! Cough's better, then? Scarlett! I found the witch who started the fire for you. You go ahead, I'll be there in a minute. You heard what the judge said about keeping out of trouble. I wasn't causing trouble, Kat! I was clearing trouble up. I saved her! What'd you want? A medal? You say that we got it wrong and then you go and do something like that. Safety and stability? The only thing she's going to get from you is an unhealthy attachment to leopard print. She's my daughter, Kat, and I'm not going anywhere until I get her back! All right? Yeah, will be. Thanks to you. Hmm. Those flowers... ..you shouldn't have done that. She was your wife. I know you loved her. Yeah. Yeah, I did. Thank you for yesterday, Gray. I tell you what, I'm loving this live-in baby-sitter thing. Honestly I'm going to put them all on a rota. What, even Ollie? Definitely Ollie! He don't do nothing, him, does he? Oh, he's lazy, I'm telling ya. Yeah. LAUGHTER Listen, you'll be next. No, mate. He will be, won't he? No, no, no. You watch. Family photo time, is it, eh? Look, whatever you're thinking, don't. Getting you wrapped around their little finger, ain't they? The baby's definitely Mick's. See? You can stop torturing yourself now, can't ya? It's time to leave it, yeah? How can you be so sure? Just trust me. Er, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to raise your glasses, please, to our newest - and hopefully last - bundle of joy... ..Annie Carter! ALL: Annie Carter! Cheers. Bless you. Oh, she's going to think this is so funny. Stacey. Although, I will have to tell her that I thought I was dying first. I never thought that I would live to see her home! And we can go on holiday! Southend can be lovely, can't it? Even in the autumn! Oh, and then there's Christmas! Oh, the whole world deserves a good Christmas, doesn't it, after last year! And I've got this mince pie recipe that I was going to pass onto her, but now I can make them myself! I really did think that I had cancer. Again. I wasn't lying. I was... ..mistaken. Either way, the drugs were on your property, so you must know something about them. Or am I... ..mistaken? HE CHUCKLES It is funny. You're not going to die before Stacey comes home... ..but you are going to go to prison... ..for a very long time.
