Come on, you witch. Come on! - Gonna burn you! - Get a move on! - You've been betrayed! - Stop flirting! Death forwards! Now! You dirty witch! Mercy! Mercy! You sure this is the place? Tom was doing some work here. He said he saw three women living along. Said there's a safe in there. Rumor in town is they got a lot of money. All right, I'm in. Okay, we go in quiet. We try not to wake anyone. Be a lot easier. Ready? Oh, I'm ready. Let's get rich. Let's do it. Quiet. Check upstairs. What are you doing? Where the hell did you come from? This is my house. Please. Shh. Shut up. Now tell me, where is the safe? We don't have a safe. Please, just leave us alone or we'll be forced to act. And I don't want to hurt you. You brought this on yourself. Where is the safe?! We don't have a safe! What the fuck? Don't touch that. Where's the money? Money? In the safe, the money! Now, that wasn't very nice, was it? What are we going to do with him? I say, let him go. We wipe his memory and we change his ways with the power of suggestion. Well, that went rather nicely. Can I keep him? We could use the Butler. What? Jesus. It felt good to use my powers like that again. Well, you know we can't, Sam. We've gotta stay to ourselves. Besides, you know humans. They'll never accept witches. We'll either end up hung by a gallow pole or burned at the stake. So why do we keep watching Dominique and her coven if we're not gonna intervene? I think Lucy's right. We can't bring attention to ourselves. We have a responsibility. We just need to keep our eyes open, and hopefully we don't have to use our powers. All I know is there's nothing like a good chardonnay. Cheers, girls. Come on, drag her this way. Be quick, the poison will wear off soon. My arms are weakening! Come on, stop your screaming, witch! You all right back there? Yeah. I'm fine. Just a nightmare. So what are you doing at the Academy, anyway, if you don't mind me asking? I am here for induction. I was offered a place. Do you know much about it? It has a good reputation. No, I've not heard anything. Why are we pulling... Are we here? Yeah, there's just like potholes and stuff. Really don't want to ruin my tires. So yeah, this is it. So how do I get in? Just, you know, head into the forest. Five minutes and the Academy's on your left. Can't miss it. Hello? Oh, hey. - I'm- - Jessica. - Yeah. - I'm Katherine. I'll show you around. Were you surprised to get your invite to the Amityville Academy? Yeah, because I never actually applied. Well, Ms. Marcom always seeks the best. What will you study here? Drama and the arts. Cool. Me too. I'll give you some advice now. Never questioned Ms. Marcom's methods. This is Ms. Marcom's office. Knock, and then enter on her command. After your induction, I'll take you to your room. We've been watching you some time. Sit. We almost exclusively offer places to students of your background. My background? This building is beautiful. The location is perfect. It allows seclusion, privacy, and minimal distractions. You've come late to semester. You have a lot to learn in a very short space of time. This is the contract. Once you've signed this, you'll be ours for the foreseeable future. Until graduation, you mean. As you wish. I'm not sure I know enough about the school. I told you, there is not much time. You must be willing to learn, and learn quickly. We will teach you here, but you must open yourself. Besides, what else have you to do? You lead a rather sad existence. Friendless, alone. Have you not always wondered why? There is no choice to make. Sign and belong to something. Something that will promise greatness in this life. Excellent. Perhaps a toast? Wait. It's getting kind of late. I should probably go to my room. Very well. Thank you, Ms. Marcom. Welcome to the Academy. What did you think of Ms. Marcom? She's a brilliant woman. I'm sure she is. Did she tell you much? She was quite vague. I'm sure you'll find out more tomorrow. Good night. Yeah. Good night. She's new as well. I'll leave you two to get acquainted. Hi! Sorry, I'm not sure if this is my room or not. She didn't... Oh, don't worry. Come hang out till you find out. - Hi, I'm Sally. - Jessica. I didn't even apply to join here. I just got offered a place. Yeah, same. You didn't know much about here, why come? I guess I was just trying to work out what to do next, you know? Maybe this is my calling. I got thrown out of my last college. No one else would take me, and then Ms. Marcom offered me a place. Hey, are you okay. Yeah, I'm fine, it was that wine Ms. Marcom gave me. It's quite strong. Oh, okay, sit down. - So sorry. - No, don't be silly. Totally okay. Here, have some of this. Thanks. No, it's totally okay. I'm so sorry, I just... No no, it happens to the best of us. Well, is it confirmed? She bears the mark. - Where was it placed? - Her back. The mark had three horns instead of two. - Are you sure? - Yes. What does it mean? Be gone. Prepare the hall and the coven, and bring the new girls to me. As you wish, Madame. What is going on? Stop it! So, we have a volunteer to go first. You will be next. The chalice. When the sacred blood is spilt, the gates will open. He will rise. And those who burnt us alive will meet their demise. He will rise. And those who burnt us alive will meet their demise. Oh great Bortis, demon of dark, accept this sacrifice in return for your promise to bring forth your legion for my command. Take this soul. And allow me the blood! Now for you, Jessica. You bear the mark of the the three-horned beast. The power that lies within, you have no idea! Get her! Boo. Get to the car, go. Hurry! Push! Come on, get in. We failed you. I'm sorry, Ms. Marcom. Apologies are for the weak, Katherine. I'm sorry! Please! Please! Please! Please! Fail me again, and I will pull your heart out and feed it to the maggots. How is she? She's okay. I gave her a sleeping spell. She needs to relax. So just what are we gonna tell this girl? I don't know. The truth? It's only fair she understands the power she has. What about Dominique? We can't interfere too much. Not until we know what. We took a big risk helping this girl. I'll study the ancient texts. Maybe that'll shed some light onto what Dominique's plan is. But she's building up to something, I can feel it. It's her! Where am I? - Who are you? - It's okay. What's your name? Jessica. Jessica, we're here to help you. Don't worry. Is it Ms. Marcom? Yes, but we're protected here by boundaries. Protected by what? She's trying to kill me! Relax. Sleep. Sleep, Jessica. She's getting stronger. We have to intensify our protection spell to keep her off the property. I agree. Yeah, no shit. We do need to decide what to do with Jessica. She's our responsibility now. I know. We have to tell Jessica the truth. But if we tell her the truth, it's our duty to teach her our ways. We're gonna have to prepare Jessica for whatever might arise. Yes, we can all feel it. Dominique's coven is gaining power every day. And we have to tell her the truth. Tell me what? Who are you? We are all members of a white witch bloodline. I'm a Lucy Belle, and these are my sisters, Sam and Elena. Witches? We study for enlightenment and healing and good. Not like Dominique. She's a mistress of the dark arts. But why did she want to kill me? You're part of our bloodline. Within our lineage, somewhere in our DNA, there lurks a power that she wants to sacrifice to increase her own. Botis? She told you this? It was the name of the demon that she was chanting for when she killed a pupil at the Academy. She said I had the three-horned mark? What does this mean? Dominique wants Jessica. Her potential, her power, her life force. It could be greater than all three of ours combined. My power. You're a witch! You've never felt your power? Felt different? Sometimes I have these strange nightmares of being burned at a stake. Those aren't nightmares. Those are residual memories of a past life. What happens now? What can I do? We'll train you, Jessica. You need to learn our ways. And how to harness your natural gifts. We'll protect you. We've got your back. What are you guys doing? Come in. Do you trust us? Yeah? Because for what we're about to do, you need to open your heart and let us in. A sisterhood of power is based on trust. Love. And light. Is your heart open? Sure, yeah. Okay. Blessed goddess of love and light, guide us on this moonlit night. Fill our hearts with energy bright and give her righteous strength to fight. Earth, fire, life, and death. Blessed goddess of love and light. guide us on this moonlit night. Fill our hearts with energy bright and give her a righteous strength to fight. Earth, fire, life, and death. Blessed goddess of love and light, guide us on this moonlit night. Guide us on this move at night. Blessed goddess of love and light, guide us on this moonlit night. What do you have to give? Speak. From your heart. Clear your mind. This is crazy. Look inside and see what you want to give. Okay. Don't be afraid. You're safe. Clear your mind. Stay calm. Clear your mind. You let go of your fear and found your power. Jessica, you have the gift. No freaking way. Ms. Marcom? Ms. Chloe Argento is here. Should I get her? No! No one go near her. You may return to your domiciles. I will welcome her myself. Hello? Hello? let me go. No, please, no! No, no, please, no! These spell and potion recipes? They're all for healing and enlightenment. Our magic is always for good. Or for defense. I think you're gonna really like some of these. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Which one's your favorite? I think I like this one. How come? It's for enhancing energy. Yeah. What is it, Elena? She's taken another one. Give me power, Botis. This is my offering to you. Give me more. More! We are close to releasing Botis. I can feel him. Ready yourselves and the others. We will retrieve Jessica tomorrow. If I give her to Botis, he will obey my commands in this realm. What's going on? It's Dominique. She's trying to break the barrier. Keep strong. Hold on tight Focus. I don't know how long I can hold this. I don't know how much longer. I felt that power again. I'm not sure where it came from and I had no control, but it felt like... Instinct? Mm-hmm. The more you train, the more power you'll gain. But I have a feeling we're running out of time. And we don't know what she's doing with Botis. We've never read the demonic texts. The words within, written in blood? And have the power to compel those who read them. And you know, someone with your potential would have been a great ally for Dominique. So why does she want to kill me? The elder will know what to do. But we don't know how much sanity she has left. She won't see us. Well, she might see Jessica. Hey, who is the elder? She's our old teacher, Tilda Von Erich. Nobody really knows how old she is. But she's read all the demonic texts. But she's remained immune to the dark powers. She'll know what Dominique is up to. But it won't be easy. She still retains power, but Dominique banished her outside of Amityville and warned her not to intervene. If you're willing, we will try. Sounds good. I'll watch the Academy and just make sure nobody tracks you. Okay. Tilda? Tilda? Jessica. Go to the cauldron. What is she doing? She's in a trance. Drink. Drink. It's good for you. Don't drink that. The taste is wretched, yes? It helps you focus. Bring me some. Tilda? Tilda? Continue by yourself. You're on your own. Lenora. - Tilda. - Silence. I want to speak with the girl. The book. The book? - This one? - Mm-hmm. It is like a family tree, I guess. The entries are chronological. You'll find Leonore Belle. 1568 to 1599. You died on New Year's Eve during a blood moon. They burned and hung women without prejudice or due process. That's horrible. Oh. She looks just like me. You are one and the same. Will I ever remember everything? It is not likely. Besides, life is best lived looking ahead. You have great power. Greater even than in your previous life. The Belles all bear the mark of two horns on a beast. It was a Wiccan symbol, a creature of peace and power. Oh, but occasionally, someone special is born with a third horn. I'm not special. Oh, you'll see. When the time comes. You want to know more about Dominique? Yes. And what of Botis? A demon who has fascinated Dominique for many years. Her extracurricular activities worried me greatly when she was my student. Like all demons, he has his domain. He is cut off from this realm. But when the stars are right, the door to open it, it becomes easier. She means to release him? Yes. Why are you watching my school? Go to hell. How about I bring hell to you! Why are you alone? Where are they? Where are your sisters? I can see your thoughts. Tilda. You won't get far. Dominique has been appeasing his lust for essence and soul with sacrifice. And with each one, she herself becomes more powerful. It takes a great deal of power to release Bortis, but it takes even more to control him. That is why she is so taken with you. Your sacrifice means the Botis will become her slave, and the world as we know it will end. We will get Dominique. We'll fight this. Then you must go. You must prepare. May we visit you after? In the next life, maybe. You will send my love to Elena. We will. Thank you. - Good luck. - Goodbye. Thank you. Oh my god, Elena! Sam, Lucy, help! What happened to her? It's an Agravarian slug. No. How do we stop it? I have an antidote for it. Keep her warm, don't let her convulse. I'll be right back. Elena, stay with us. Stay strong, I need you. We all need you. Remember, two drops, no more, no less. Okay. Hold her mouth open. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay, come on. Okay. Come on. Get it out. Good, good girl. What are you working on? I'm working on breaking a protection spell. And I'm almost done. How's Elena doing? She's okay. She's out in the back with Jess. Great. I brought you this. Oh, thank you. Oh, these are beautiful. Remember what I taught you. Breathe in. Focus. Focus. You can do this I did it! You did! I can't believe it! It went so fast, did you see that? Yes, it was awesome. - Wanna do it again? - Yeah I do! So fun. You old crow. I told you not to interfere! Yet you defied me. What did you tell them? It matters not, now. Once I have the girl, I will release and enslave Botis. There must be something inside of you, Dominique, something of that girl who first came to my Academy. My Academy! How could you release Botis? There will be nothing left! What's left is mine. When sacred blood is spilled, the gates will open. He will rise, and those who burned us alive will meet their demise. I will allow you to live to see hell. Elena, wake up. Wake up! Come on, Elena. Where's Jessica. Sam! Are we too late? We have until midnight tonight. That's when the blood moon is at its fullest and the planets are all in alignment. Our focus needs to be on rescuing Jessica first and foremost. Without her, Dominique cannot control the demon. Can she release him without her? If they do unleash him, we've got a short window of time to put him back before his power fully forms in this realm. Would she do that? We will prepare for the fight, The power of three. The power of three. The power of three. The power of three. The hour is almost upon us. It's a shame you won't be around to witness the new dawn. I shall return soon. I think we have visitors I should prepare for. Unleash me! I will sacrifice the final offering soon. Release me! You pledge your power to my every command? If the offering satisfies, yes. It will. Stop right there. Don't even think about it. I warned you. Come on, we better go. This is it. Jessica? Water, earth, fire, air, feel the pain, feel my stare. Lucy, are you all right? Lucy! Dominique has a voodoo doll! I can break the spell, give me your hand. It's okay. Stay with me. Hold my hand, stay with me. Lucy. You're okay. You okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? She's okay, she's okay. We have to get to the great hall. That's where she'll perform the sacrifice. Okay. Okay. She's weakening! No! Are you all right? You all right? I await my sacrifice. I cannot give her to you! You must give me more blood of power to release me! You'll get your sacrifice. In exchange for a promise. Of what to you? Destruction. Turmoil. Blackness, death of everyone in the Belle bloodline. So be it. Oh great Botis, demon of dark. Accept my final offering... And fulfill my last wish. No! No! Run! Quickly. Where is he? We have to banish him, so his power doesn't go stronger. Don't break the circle. Don't break the circle. Don't break the circle. Don't break the circle. Where is he? What is happening? Don't, Jessica. I'll take what was promised to me! Demon dead. We did it. Dead demon! Is Jessica still sleeping? Yeah, she's been restless the last few nights. What did we decide? About the Academy girls? Well, I say they're eager to learn from us. We teach them, and we set them on the right path. But I don't think we should teach them at the Academy. Those walls are cursed. Hmm. But we could teach them here. Agreed. Sam? Lucy, Elena! Jess, what's the matter? Something's coming. We need to go to Salem. You gotta be kidding me.
