He has been living in London for the past 25 years, -and now he's returned to India. -Really? -But he's a true Indian. -Wow! London! A house over there... and that's the other house. Shalini. Happy birthday, dear. The priest gave me a garland to put it on your photo. But... garlands are offered to someone who is dead. But you aren't dead. You are still with me. You are with me every moment. Happy birthday, my dear! My dear! My dear! There's no news of Sania yet. It's 3 a.m. I will go check my place again. Where have you been? I was at my friend's birthday party. Do you realize how late it is? Aren't... Aren't you ashamed? I've been looking for you for four hours. Why? I'm not a kid! Go to bed, Papa. We'll talk in the morning. Why can't we talk now? -You are drunk. -I just had wine, not alcohol. You had wine? I said we'll talk in the morning. Or else I'll file a complaint against you to the police. Sania, are you out of your mind? If you can't answer your children's questions, you can never be their friend. -Drinking Coke in the store? -Why not? I know your weakness. We have Coke at home. I don't have one, but two weaknesses. First is Coke and the other is your beautiful hair. Besides, this is the best coolant for a hot-head person like me. Here's a coolant for your hot head. Look at this greeting card. Sanskrit verses. The only time I heard and spoke Sanskrit was at my wedding when the priest recited the mumbo-jumbo and then I heard Buckingham, Birmingham! You are a Sanskrit scholar. A professor. You teach at London University. Could you please translate this for me? What does it mean? It says, we should love our kids and spoil them till they are five. Once they turn ten, you should keep tabs on them. But once they turn 16, you should be friends with them. Get that, mister? Once they turn 16, you should be their friend. If you want a happy home, forever. -It's an old hat. -But it's new for the younger generation. Friendship with daughters! For a father like me, that too, in an alien land. Return the trolley. I'll be in the car. Yes, sir. Always. Shalini! Shalini! Get up. Dear. Shalu. Shalu. Oh God! No! Shalu. This is not done. The doctor gave me only two minutes to talk to you. No, love, I'm with you. But... I never took a single breath without you in the past 25 years. You've taken care of everything. What am I going to do now? The house, daughters. How am I going to take care of them? What will I tell them? You will talk to them, my dear. You are their mother... and father too. Just promise me one thing. Tell me, love. Until they get married... don't stay away from them... be friends with them. My love, how will I do it? Ever since they've grown up, I never had a chat with them. Remember those Sanskrit verses? Yes. Shalu! Give our three daughters a grand farewell. Understand them... and make them understand. There! I've slapped you. Come with me to the police. -Isha! -Report me. Isha! We have been friends for 25 years. If not us, who else will you share your feelings to? You are like family. Who else will I tell this to? Stop bickering over petty issues. So what if they're daughters? The world is full of daughters. LK, he can't handle them means he really can't. If you can be best friend to my son, Ronit, then why not your daughters? Tell me. LK, daughters are different. Right, Dr Javed? What are you going to do then? I'm thinking of going back to India. For a change. Still, it's very tough for a father to be a mother as well. I'll try. Goodbye! Kids these days! I put Ronit in a hostel ever since he was a kid. Let him grow there. Just let him grow there. That's why I left my kids in Lahore. I told them, kids should stay where they belong. You can hit me. Show no mercy. I had lost my mind. No, dear. You're the best. -You are... -Papa. Three of us took an oath today that we'll never hurt you and never fight. It's all my fault. It's completely my fault. I have realized that your mother was your best friend. A father only provides. Money and comforts. But a mother... is your best friend who shares your problems and sorrows. But... I didn't. I couldn't share your feelings. No, Papa. Now that Ma is gone, you are our friend. We'll do whatever you say. Thank you, children. There's only one place which is full of light and hope. My India. Ever since my friend Raj has gone to India, London seems like a city of ruins to me. My friend has gone. Now worry about your son. He will go to India, looking for Raj, right? It's obvious, sweetheart. Raj is like a mother, a father and a friend to him. Yes. We are not his parents. We are, but in the name only. Ronit is Raj and Shalini's son. He has inherited their nature and their perspective. That's why he behaves like a middle-class guy. Hundred percent, Nalini. He left this huge palace and opened a studio. He's an artist. Indian music! It unites millions of Asian Indians across the world by a single thread. Indian music ends all quarrels over race and creed. Teaches one language to Punjabis, Maharashtrians, Gujaratis, Bengalis... Makes every Indian a global Indian. For friendship, love, marriage, Ronit, Uncle Raj called for you. Sent an email, too. Don't forget to read it. -Uncle Raj. -Yes, Uncle Raj. -for anything less than 500,000 dollars. -Right. If they agree, then great, or else ask them to... I went to India without informing you. Lalit will tell you the reason. Sorry, pal, I had to go. It's pointless telling you that we miss you. We talk about you all the time. Today I was telling Isha and Avantika about the incident in your college, when Shalini and I visited you. You had just been awarded the trophy for the best student in the college. Instead of going to Lalit and Nalini, you came to me directly. You forgot your parents and you touched Shalini's feet. Lalit was so jealous! I remember. And Shalini was so happy. With memories like these, we're trying to begin a new life. Isha will have to go to London to complete her education. Take care of yourself, Ronit. Your best friend, Uncle Raj. There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words Words are forgotten Not the memories Words are forgotten Not the memories Cherished memories of our loved ones They return when they're gone Memories! Memories! Memories! My darling, this life Is like flowing water After the water has flown What remains? Memories! Memories! Memories! There is love There are complaints There are stories There are words Words are forgotten Not the memories Cherished memories of loved ones Return in our lives when they're gone Memories! Memories! Memories! "There are songs and complaints. There are stories and words. Words are forgotten. Not the memories. Cherished memories of loved ones, return in our lives when they're gone. These memories, oh, memories. Memories!" Memories! All of us, everyone Long for cherished memories Some happiness, bits of sorrows They belong to us We belong to them Memories! Sweet memories! Bittersweet memories There are songs There are complaints There are stories and words Words are forgotten Not the memories Cherished memories of our loved ones They return when they're gone Memories! Memories! Memories! Memories! Our stock were down till yesterday, not today. Just wait till Monday and it will surely rise. Sir, we're praying to the Goddess of Fortune. Now She is bound to grace my home. Inform Enam Mutual Funds. Yes. Oh, yes. Join us for the prayers. Your uncle is very angry. Pray. An artist! That's what your son is. He doesn't know the importance of the prayers. How could I? Because you were worshipping Goddess Vaishno Devi till last year. It didn't work out as expected. So we changed. Bob! The priests say that the Goddess of Fortune was unhappy last year. -This prayer will help us to please Her. -Dear, today, if you worship the Goddess of Fortune and seek any favors, they will be granted. Really? Try it once. Should I whisper or say it aloud? As you wish. Oh Goddess of Fortune, You are a Mother to everyone... be it the high and the mighty, the rich, the poor. All of them are dear to You. Lots of people in India worship You. Why don't You eradicate their poverty? Everyone is rich in this house. Then there's no point in blessing this house. Oh Mother, forget about the rich and go to the poor. All of India awaits Your blessings. Sorry, Mother. Actually... we're all fine here. In fact, we are doing great. All we need is Your blessings. Mother, I'm going to call Uncle Raj. Carry on with the prayers. Did you see your son's arrogance? That's what happens when you don't control your children. Jagdish, it's really too bad. Just too bad. Ronit. You should be ashamed! -Such arrogance! -Just because I spoke the truth? We shouldn't worship God for our selfish needs. A prayer should be heartfelt. Where are you going now? To Uncle Raj. He's your friend, but I know his pain. Just think. Uncle Raj lived abroad all these years but he was grief-stricken when he went to India. If we don't share his grief, then who will? I understand, son. Nalini, who gave birth to Ronit? You or Shalini? Jagdish! Your mother always wanted that once all of you were married, we should retire and come to live in India, in this very farm house. When the time came, she left me all alone. She asked me not to be just their father... but their friend. Mother was 500% correct. Father, when did you meet her for the first time? Who proposed first? Mom or you? Please tell me. I did. Now tell us, when mother said "I love you" for the first time. Now you are crossing the limit. You want to be our friend, but look at you now! So will you tell me if you fall in love... I don't believe in all this, Papa. I'll slap him if he dares to propose me. "Marry me and take me home." Papa is saying that if someone proposes us, we should tell Papa first. That's fair. Very good, children. So today, on our anniversary... all of us will become friends and make a promise to each other. An agreement. -We don't understand. -There's no need to get anxious. I just want to say that, someday, somewhere, some guy will enter your life. Someone who want to marry you and maybe you want to marry him. -So what's wrong with that? -I never said it's wrong. I said you have every right to get married and I'll agree to it. But remember one thing. I have every right to choose the family of that boy. -Will you give me this right? -But why, Papa? You are so innocent, dear. When you get married, it's not only the boy... you'll have to accept his entire family as your own. The whole family. Right, children? You are right, Papa. We accept your condition. Right? So today all the four friends will make a promise, to share our feelings openly. We will be living together and be a friendly family. Thank you, my children. Avantika, go quickly and bring all the sweets and snacks. -Not at all. -Why? No sweets and snacks till you sing a song for us. -Which song? -Our favorite song. There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words Words are forgotten Not the memories Oh my God, it's Ronit! Words are forgotten -Not the memories -I don't believe this! Memories! Memories! Memories! Avantika! You left me alone there and came to India. I knew you would. And you, Sania idiot. You forgot me as soon as you came to India. -Not even a phone call? -Sorry, man! -Where's Isha? Where is she? -She's inside. -Isha! -Hey, man! -Hey, man! -Uncle Raj. -Hey, you guys! -How are you doing? Isha! Isha! Isha! Where is she? Isha! Stupid! Finally you remember me? All forgotten. the whole world has turned into a dot-com, which helps bring Indians in every corner of the world closer. Those who don't want to fall in love, can get married straightaway. -How come? -Take yourself for instance. If we have to find a handsome boy who is worthy of you, where and how to find the most suitable guy. Now you have come to the point! Tell us. Computer, advise us where to find a suitable, handsome boy, the right match for Avantika. There you go. Three eligible boys. You have a choice. I like all of them. Let's get all three of them married. It's solved, right? The boy in the middle is Pankaj Kudesia. I know him. -How? -We studied together in London. He's a vice president at Hotel Surya in Delhi. He lived in London, but he's still Indian. This is the best thing about him. -What do you say, Avantika? -I don't know. There's a boy for Sania too. Take a look. -Find someone for our Isha too. -Yeah, of course. Just a minute. -Mindy! -Yes? Please upload Isha's picture on the website. There you go. "Please wait. An eligible man for Isha." What is that, buddy? The computer found the match. What can I do? Even your mom used to complain. Ties are always a hassle. Be frank while talking to the suitor's family. Isha, you know I'm not good at that. "Yes, sir. No, sir. Please eat, drink and all that." I'm glad I have Ronit with me. Otherwise... What can Ronit do? He's too young. The elders should always do the talking. -Stop depending on him. -But I... No ifs and buts. Mr. Raj, Ronit and Pankaj, both of them are like a son to me. Ronit told us everything about Avantika. All I wanted was to meet you. -And here we are. -Even I wanted... What I wanted, Ronit... He wanted to meet you and ask you... After all, the wedding arrangements... If you have any conditions or demands... You know? Exactly! Let me know your demands or conditions. I'll fulfill everything. Mr. Raj, decent parents, a good girl and a simple wedding, are my three conditions. And nothing else. Yes. Don't worry. Avantika won't face any problems at our place. That's exactly what I meant. I hope I was within my limits. It's not about crossing the limits. I just want him to be frank and bold. Just one color, you know. Different shades create problems. Be it black or white. If it's black, it should be completely black. If it's white, it should be completely white. But some people will ruin the best of situations, by trying to mix black with white. That's where the confusion arises and confusion leads to problems. And it is very difficult to find solution for every problem. Now that we have met you, we'll find a right solution. One must be alert. Not that there's any problem. Cover it. Babulal is on the line. Excuse me. How about tea or something? It's been quite a while. No. Thank you! How long have you been working here? He is not a servant. Meet Mr. Khanna. My daddy's friend for 35 years. He owns a golf club. I'm as good as a servant. Being friends with Mohanlal is just like being a servant. Enough! Let me leave before I make any more mistakes. And look at him staring me down. Because you are wearing two different socks! Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? My restlessness! My restlessness, my loneliness In my restlessness I'm so lonely! Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? What strange breeze blows this year? Try as I will, my feet are unsteady Why am I having these thoughts? Why all my friends are Putting henna on their palms? I want to put forward my palm Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? The days are too short The nights too long Before the monsoons It has started raining I started dreaming about someone special Go away Don't teach me these strange things Both of you have harassed me a lot Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? Oh, look, this is no picture This is a message Someone from far away sends you greetings He's so handsome He has a cute name Good friends bring hearts closer One of you will be a bride Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? Tell me, what riddle is this, friend? Why are such strange things happening? Ronit! Ronit! Ronit! Ronit! Ronit! Madam, cyclist. Do you know that bicycles have brakes? You're off to London without saying bye. -I meet everyone, didn't I? -Except me, you idiot. I didn't think it's necessary. Idiot, you were busy working out. I would've missed my flight. Why? -Did you miss me? -Not at all! Papa handed me your gift at the wedding. To give it to you. I forgot about it. Sorry. Here's your message. Here's your gift from papa. Not from me. From papa? Put this on my wrist, will you? One for Sania and the other for you. For me? Why? I don't want to get married. Till? Till I finish college. And then? I'll do whatever papa says. -Arranged or love marriage? -I don't believe in love. I know. But why? Those who fall in love are good-for-nothing. It's too dramatic. In real life, love's an entertainment package that you get when you are young adults. When girls like you fall in love, it all leads to great love stories. Girls like me only make history, not love stories. Remember, a day will come, when a handsome young man will move you to tears. Your love story will begin that very day. They will fall in love. They surely will. I am asking you! Who is this guy? Who is he? Papa, he's Sukant. I've known him for a year. He lives in Delhi. I'm in love with him. But I've seen him with goons, outside our house in London. -And... -Yes, Papa, but Sukant is good at heart. Besides, we've decided to get married. Oh I see. So everything has been decided? Then you don't need me anymore. Right? I should at least have the right to choose my husband. Listen, your daughter loves our son. And our son loves both of us. After all, he's our only son. He has returned after completing his education in London. I don't know what to say. We got many marriage proposals for our son, but we turned them all down. Now both of them are in love! To hell with love! Our son! He's such a gem, I tell you. Your daughter is also very pretty. She looks prettier when she dresses up. Mama, please. Don't talk too much. I'm not talking too much. We're finalizing wedding details. We should talk openly. -Right, Raj? -Yes. I want you to talk to me openly. -There you go! -Sorry? We don't want dowry. You can give your daughter whatever you want. We have no objection. Not at all! We don't want jackets and expensive clothes. But the wedding must take place at a five-star hotel. Hotel Surya. We've got a status to maintain. After all, this isn't only about their marriage. This relationship continues after marriage as well. The real relationship begins after marriage. We'll keep visiting each other. We aren't greedy. Not at all! -Uncle, you haven't eaten anything. -No, dear. I don't feel like eating. I'm in a hurry. -That's it? -Great! I don't understand. Am I marrying Sukant or his family? That's what I am trying to explain time and again. After marriage, your name will neither be Sweetheart nor Mrs. Sukant. A married woman has to fulfill so many relationships. Daughter-in-law, aunt, etc. You have to fulfill your duty towards those relationships. His family is not worthy of you. You don't want me to be happy. I understood. But I've made my decision. That's it. Then listen to my decision too. Did you see that? Papa. Isha. Avantika. I heard everything. I'll try to convince her. It's a tough task for a father to convince her daughters. What are you staring at? Get out! Get out from here. Where do they come from? Let go of me! I don't want to live anymore! -Why is she crying? -Sania poured kerosene on herself. She's trying to set herself ablaze! Leave me alone! Let me die! I want to go to my mother! Have you gone mad? At least think of us, think about papa! -Do you know what you're doing? -Does anyone care about me? -I don't want to live. -Sania! -Have you gone mad? -Yes, I have! Let go of her! Come on, let her go. Let go of her. Sania, what's the matter? -You aren't my papa! -Yes, I am not. -You aren't! -No, I'm not. Listen to me. Come with me and listen to me. Cool down. Come and listen to me. Listen to me, dear. I tried to reason with you... but you didn't relent. Now everything will happen as per your wish. You're going to marry the man you want. Okay? -Sukant? -Yes. To Sukant. But remember one thing. The future of this marriage is solely your responsibility. I'll manage. Avantika, Isha, let's prepare for the wedding. Delhi, full of generous people. -Greetings from the heart. -Salute! So finally, Sania and Sukant's love triumphs. Love is such a strange thing! At sometime or the other, somewhere or the other, everyone without exception has fallen in love. Some love stories have been successful, some were unrequited. But their love will always be remembered. In the name of love, all the youngsters have decided, that tonight... I'm not going to sing. No way. -Uncle Raj will sing tonight. -Yes! Surprised, Uncle Raj? No, no. Few years ago, friends, there was a rumor I fell in love with someone We too had a first meeting I too fell in love with someone Few years ago, friends, there was a rumor I fell in love with someone In the rains, on the streets I was walking about, holding an umbrella I saw her coming I saw her coming Like this! Like this We bumped into each other We were embarrassed Bewildered, we apologized But what we really meant was Give me your heart Give me your heart Give me your heart Give me your heart Give me your heart Romance happened by chance Romance happened by chance We became lovers, but we had a little time In a hurry, I give my heart I called the priest I sat on a horse and became a bridegroom I became the bridegroom I became the bridegroom So beautiful So beautiful was the night When we got married Oh yes, I too fell in love with someone Few years ago, friends, there was a rumor I fell in love with someone Had she been here tonight She would've played the drum Had she been here tonight She would've played the drum She would have been dancing She would've kissed her girl She would've blessed you She'd have warded off the evil eye She would've sung a song of love She would've looked like fire Fire that would've engulfed me But everything has changed Everything has changed Everything has changed That day I wept like rain Even I fell in love with someone Few years ago, friends, there was a rumor I fell in love with someone There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words Words are forgotten Not the memories Words are forgotten Not the memories Memories! Memories! Memories! Cherished memories of loved ones Return in our lives when they're gone Avantika. -How are you, dear? -Fine, Papa! What are you doing? How's Isha? Isha has gone to Malaysia for a cycling race. You know what? In London, Uncle Ranbir Rai has bagged the best businessman of the year award. Really? -Congratulations, Ranbir! -Thank you, Malhotra. -Congratulations, Mrs. Rai! -Congratulations, Mr. Rai! -Malhotra, you're wonderful! -How come? You threw a party as soon as I got the award. I offered you my hand in friendship, I won't let you go easily. You haven't seen my friendship yet. Raj keeps praising you to the skies. Raj is like a son to me. I've known him since he was a baby. We couldn't attend his daughter's wedding. -You know, business matters. -Yeah. -I can't see Monishka around. -There she is, with your son. Right from friendship to love? And from love to marriage. Marriage? How boring! Do they make a good couple? What are you doing tomorrow evening? Tomorrow, I'm flying to Malaysia. To cover the Asian Bicycle Race. -Bicycle race? -It's a major event. -Bicycle Championship. -Has everyone eaten? Wow! -Boss, Isha is here, too. -I know. -But she doesn't know we are here. -But where's she? Son, you can't even see her. Only I can see her. Today's the first day of the Asian Bicycle Race. Companies from 21 countries have sent their best racers here. Sunday, the biggest day of this event will see, Preeti Sawhney of Dubai, UAE is participating in this event. She's an Indian and has been winning this race for the last two years. Looks like there's no competition for her this year as well. Preeti Sawhney greets you all. Now we'll introduce you to Isha Puri from London. -Excuse me, miss. Where are you from? -England. -Originally from? -India. -Your name? -Isha. Your goal? -To be number one. -Do you have a boyfriend? So you don't believe in love? -Not at all. -Is there someone who loves you? -Are you crazy? -No. Ronit! -Trying to make a fool out of me? -I don't need to. You are a fool. Their childhood love -I didn't expect you to be here. -I managed to get here somehow. -I knew you'd be here. -Papa must've told you. True. But you had to be here, you're the star of this bicycle event. I'm just a small-time reporter here. Ronit, no offence, but I'd like to be independent here. -Far away from the world and home. -Far from me too? -Maybe, yes. -Is it? So in this event, you and I... -Strangers. -Right! Stranger! Come on, Isha. Only an hour to go before the event. Wait! Soft fingers, warm hands and solid wrists. It can be only one person. I stopped the rehearsal to hear that. Now that you have said I'm the best, I'll become the best. Race starts now! -You know, Preeti, I like your nature. -I like everything about you. Pass-Pass. Want some? Oh, yes, of course. Whenever I eat Pass-Pass, I think of you. Look, she is trying to get close to him by offering Pass-Pass. My belt is a bit too tight. Look at him! He's undoing her belt. How am I going to win tomorrow's race? Sania. -Papa! -What happened? Papa. I don't want to be with Sukant. That isn't a house but hell. His mother ill-treats me and his father curses me day and night. Even Sukant takes his mother's side. They are very bad people. I've decided to divorce him. That's it! You were right. Love is nonsense. Isha was right. Go and rest. It's your home. Come, dear. Go and rest. Come. Miss Preeti Sawhney is on her way at full throttle. Everyone's eyes and hopes are on Preeti Sawhney. Preeti Sawhney, world number one. Isha Puri is competing with her in this race. Preeti Sawhney is leading right now and she's in total control. Isha Puri is right behind her, trying her best. Her face is red and she looks exhausted, but Preeti is our favorite. This bicycle race is just between two girls. Isha Puri and world number one Preeti Sawhney. Preeti Sawhney, everyone's favorite is leading the... The heroine of Hero Cycles, Miss Isha Puri has won the Asian Bicycle Championship. You are bound to win when you're jealous. Well done! -Did you hear her? -After all, she's an actress. Isha, a few words for our dotcom? Yes. I don't want to thank anyone right now. I won because of my determination and persistence. And by God's grace. No one deserves the credit for this. And these TV, website reporters tell you half truths and half lies. Please don't trust them. Thank you! Congratulations! But winners shouldn't be so arrogant. So should the losers be arrogant? Go to your "Pass-Pass" friend. Now I get it. So that's the problem! You know it was just a joke. Look, Mr. Stranger. I want to make one thing very clear. I'm going to Tuba Island with my group. Don't follow me. Come on, Pinky. Ronit, Tuba Island! It's teeming with dangerous animals. Stop! Isha has been left behind. Please stop! Stop the boat! Stop! Ronit! Isha is on Tuba Island and she's in trouble! -Even her friends have deserted her and... -And... -What else? -And... Isha! Isha! Isha! Did you find out anything about her? How can I know? Our hero is trapped because of your attitude queen. We are out of coverage area. Last night, the doctor said Ronit wasn't going to survive. I must see him. You aren't supposed to get up. You may not care about him, but what he did was unimaginable, Isha. -Nurse, how is Ronit? -He's out of danger now. Isha. Remember what I had said? One day, there will be tears in your eyes. What's this? Let go. Let go of my hand. Look, uncle. I'd already made it clear to Sania that my mother was very short-tempered and that she minces no words when she criticizes someone and Sania can't stop herself from retorting. Whatever I said was right. Sania! Papa, I don't want to live there. I'm the one who is being punished between wife and mother. Sukant has come to take Sania back. Uncle, I'll arrange for a house as soon as I get the job. I can't stay in the same house with his mother. That's it. It's not done. Look, Sukant. I understand everything. Wait for a few days. It was your choice to fall in love and get married. You will have to resolve your differences. When hearts meet Flowers blossom When hearts meet, flowers bloom When flowers bloom, hearts meet When hearts meet Flowers bloom Flowers bloom Passion ignites love Passion ignites love Storms rage in the seas of the heart The earth shakes, heavens fall! Love is destruction Love is prayer too Some pray for love, some curse When hearts meet Flowers bloom When hearts meet Flowers bloom When hearts meet, flowers bloom Flowers bloom when hearts meet When hearts meet! When our hearts meet Passion ignites love Ever since you entered my heart My life is in peril Even amidst revelers, I'm lonely In loneliness I revel This is a world of our love Come embrace me Put an end to this suffering When hearts meet When hearts meet Flowers blossom Flowers bloom Whatever you wish Let us do, oh, let's do Right here, right now Oh, let me die Our hearts Oh, dear sweet hearts With memories Let us fill Flowers bloom When hearts meet When hearts meet Flowers bloom When hearts meet When hearts meet When hearts meet When hearts meet Flowers bloom When hearts meet Someone bans love While someone bows before it Someone bans love While someone bows before it Lies! Everything's a lie. Lies! It's all a lie. Friendship, love, romance! It's all a lie. It's just a deception! I made a mistake by listening to you! A father can never become his daughter's friend. Never. I wish I hadn't listened to Sania. Damn this love! Avantika! Sania! Papa! Papa, everyone is in Udaipur and you are still here. It's so late. You should leave now. It's your best friend's silver jubilee marriage anniversary. Isha and Ronit have arranged a grand show and... -But... -No ifs and buts. I know you are worried about Sania. I'll look after her. Please. Don't tell anyone about Sania. Not even Isha. Why spoil the mood? The invitation list includes VIPs from all over the world. That's not the case, Miss Nalini. Rajasthan, Udaipur is our village. But I don't understand one thing. In spite of living in England, why did you choose the Maharaja Palace for the fancy dress party? It's our son Ronit's idea. This whole arrangement, this fancy dress party, this celebration, has been organized by Ronit and Isha. But you haven't introduced me to Ronit. Yes. Where is Ronit? Call him. Ronit! Ronit! Don't force me to dance at the party. I can't dance. Then who is going to dance with me? You can find any butterfly. Lots of them are flying about. You love flattering them, don't you? What are you staring at? Your eyes. Don't go. Sit down. We've been friends ever since we were kids. But today... we're lovers. -Tomorrow... -Tomorrow? Just you and I, together. Just us? -Just us. -That's it! That's it! Ronit! -Where are you? -Papa. -Your friend has come. -Go to Papa. Okay. Off I go. You'll speak to papa, won't you? -About what? -You don't know? Oh, yes! I'll ask him to get Isha married as soon as possible. If she falls in love with someone, it could be a problem, right? -Uncle Raj! -Ronit! Ronit! Welcome to Udaipur! I forgive you for being late. I'd like to tell you something, before someone else does. Me first. -First listen to me. -Me first. -Me first. -Me! That's the third time, so it's my turn. Listen. My friend. Sania married her lover. Now she's back home. She wants a divorce. She can't put up with his family. That's what happens to those who fall in love, my friend. I know! I have to pretend to be happy, smile, and sing. Avantika also asked me not to come here with a sad face. "Keep smiling, hang out with Ronit." After all, it's my friend's silver jubilee marriage anniversary. I have to sing and dance. -Happy anniversary, sister-in-law. -Thank you, Raj. -That's enough. -I'm just kidding, buddy. You are... We met at the award function. How can I forget you? Back in America, whenever I was in front of the computer, I've memorized all your dotcoms, all your catch lines. -Ronit, Isha is refusing to dance! -Right! We need at least one girl in the lead. What do we do now? Would you be my dancing partner? Me? I don't expose myself. Do it for us, please. Do it for my sake. For you, dotcom. Ladies and gentlemen! From Buckingham Palace to South Hall Chandigarh to Ludhiana Everybody is falling in love Every Tom, Dick and Harry is saying "I love you" I love you, I love you Once you fall in love Once you fall in love You have no peace This world threatens the heart But the heart isn't even afraid of God Oh, baby! Oh, baby! This is a glittering evening My wine is spilling over This is a glittering evening My wine is spilling over Love is another name For life Here's one from the heart Oh, baby! Hear my clinking bangles Conversation These worthless conversations! -Oh ho! -Oh, baby! -Oh ho! -Oh, baby! Scorching sunshine And not an ounce of shade Love's is the world of maze You're the princess in the maze, my love Just let me take your hand I wish no one ever knocked At the window to my heart I hope no one else leads you Out of the maze All those legends Who sacrificed themselves For love, they lived For love, they died Oh, baby! Love is a blast My lover is creating a scene The colors of love never wear off Romeos will never give up loving No matter how many heartbreaks they endure In the end, you lose, I win Losing to you is better than winning Both of us are here Face-to-face Offering each other our hearts Oh, baby! Your walk is out of control! Swaying to your beat Lovers have done What prophets said they would Given hearts, taken hearts Oh, baby! This is a glittering evening My wine is spilling over Hear my clinking bangles Conversation These worthless conversations! These worthless conversations! These conversations! Jagdish, Ronit, everyone has left. Today I'm leaving for London too. I've heard about Sania. What happened is really unfortunate. But Jagdish gave me good advice. He says we can help Sukant get a nice job in a friend's firm in Dubai. Sukant can send home a good amount every month for his greedy parents. His parents' and Sania, both of them will be happy. Your brother is a gentleman. I am indebted to your family! Yesterday, my brother said something strange. Quite strange. What? That Ronit should marry Monishka. Marry? He's just finished his studies. Let him achieve something. But, Ronit likes Monishka. -What? -Yeah. Didn't you notice yesterday? He held her hand and drew her close while dancing. Oh yes! Yes, you are right! How stupid of me! How could I not notice all this! And, Raj... ...my brother is very interested. So what's the problem? Why don't you bring it up? So what do you think of this marriage proposal? What do I think? Don't you know your daughter's attitude? Twenty-one marriage proposals and madam likes none! For the first time, she says "not-bad" about Ronit. Not bad! She's your daughter after all. If you ask me, let's agree to Raj's proposition. Or she'll die a spinster. Even I like Ronit. He'll handle Monishka well. In that case, you should see Raj. Mr. Rai is here. Tell Malhotra that I accept his proposition. Thank you very much, Mr. Rai. We've known you for many more years than we've known Ronit and the Malhotras. We're giving our daughter away because we trust you. Thank you, Mr. Rai. Hail Goddess! Everything went well! What are you saying? I'm coming to London the day after. Don't tell Ronit anything until I reach London. -Where are you? -Heathrow Airport. -We're in Thorpe Park. Hurry. -I'm coming. I'm just coming, dear. -I love you! -I love you, dear. Uncle Raj! Hey, Uncle Raj! I have good news for you! I've got something to tell you! I have good news for you! I've got something to tell you! But we have the most exciting news to tell you! -I got news! -Me first. -Uncle Raj, me first! -Me first. -Me first. -Uncle Raj! Thrice over. Overruled. -My company follows a policy. -What? Special messages are sent in style. Like... in this case. -What is this? -Read on. We'll be back and then we'll seek your blessings. -My blessings? -Come, Isha. On day one, I was refused. On day two, she agreed. On day three, she said "I love you." We fell in love! We want to get married! We want to get married! We want to get married! Where has papa gone? -He just left. -Where? He drove away in the car. Ronit, he left the cards. Initial shock. It was bound to happen. After all, he's a father. Now he's going to ask me a million questions. Then he'll say, -But he... -Isha, don't worry. I'm here to take care of everything. -Hello! -Ronit? Mr. Hudson has arrived from Scotland. He saw our presentation. Everything's set. We are waiting for you. Come soon. Isha, I have to go back to the office. An important client has visited us and I must meet him. I might be away for three or four days. Don't worry. Our case is very simple! No problems at all. Later. Ronit was right. That you will be happy, but you're gonna take time to accept it. To tell you the truth, I've known Ronit ever since I was a kid. For the first time, I got to know him. He says, if he wasn't born rich. he'd have a small... ramshackle house... and it'd be lovely. Fights, patch-ups, hope, despair, life lived moment by moment. Having everything is so boring, isn't it, Papa? Oh, yes, it was he who proposed to me, not me. So now... we like the boy and the boy's family too. Do you know... Sania is back home? She wants a divorce from Sukant. Divorce. Divorce. If you want my answer in one word... Then it's... no. You and Ronit... never. Avantika? Papa! Thank God he survived. I keep telling him, "London streets aren't Punjab roads. -True. -Stop strutting around." Is this any way to express anger? I don't like this approach one bit. Those who shy away from responsibilities behave like this. Why did you do this? Ronit played a prank and he used his corporate greeting cards. I just went along with him to see your reaction. I've seen your reaction! You run amok in traffic like a kid! You should have been angry with me and not with yourself. There's nothing going on between Ronit and me. It was only a bit of fun and games in Bangkok, you know how it is? Why are you getting so serious? It wasn't serious at all. Look at these keys. Remember what mother used to say? Papa. You are lying. Lying to your papa. I've seen through your lies. How will you live with the pain I inflicted? You love your papa very much, don't you? Had you been harmed, it would've been so unfortunate. What would become of us? Let me tell you one thing, dear. They are very rich people. You can never get married into that family. They're my friends. I know their expectations. Monishka. I have planned Ronit and Monishka's wedding. I spoke to Mr. Rai. And now... That's fine. Monishka is the right choice for Ronit. But I'm with you, Papa. I swear upon mummy. I swear upon you. But first you must promise, never to create a scene like this ever again. Let me answer the door. Look, how she's trying to con me. -Papa, look who's here! -Who is it, dear? Avantika. Hey? -Greetings! -God bless you! -What have you done, Papa? -You shouldn't have informed them, Isha. -Why? Am I not your daughter? -Yes, but... You are not aware of the latest news. -Just see who's come with us. -Who? -Hey, Sania! -Sania? -Papa! -Sania! Sukant? Uncle JKM sent us tickets to London so that we could come over. He gave us an appointment letter for his Dubai office to join from 1st November. Hail Goddess. -I'm so happy to see you together. -Hello? Just a minute, uncle. Papa. Uncle Lalit is on the line. -Yes, Lalit, -Hi! They're here. Yes, I'm coming and so is Isha. Yes, I'll talk to Ronit. Of course! Hail Lord Shiva! All the gods and goddesses have been kind to us. But ever since Lord Shiva entered our house, our stock prices have been soaring. Now look, you visited us on a Monday, Lord Shiva's auspicious day. -Where's Ronit? -Ronit? He is getting ready. He has just returned after a two-day visit to Scotland. Answer one question, Uncle Raj! Are you doing the right thing? I have no right to choose my life partner? I don't accept this proposition. Anyone who tries to force me into it, is an enemy, not a friend. Not your enemy, it was a friend of yours who finalized this match. I fixed it. Am I your enemy? I don't mean that. Look, dear. The family, the background, matter when it comes to marriage. What matters is the heart. Carve out my heart and see for yourself, some other name is written on it. I don't even want to hear another name. You must, Uncle Raj. Look, dear. I've never asked anything from you. Today, I want you to make a promise to me. You won't create a scene before your parents and your uncle. For my sake, for Shalini's sake. The millet seeds The millet seeds are Dispersed in the streets My beloved is upset with me He abandoned me, bring him back The millet seeds The millet seeds are Dispersed in the streets My beloved is upset with me He abandoned me, bring him back The millet seeds Congratulations, JKM! Congratulations! We are done with the priests. Now get up, meet people. Isha, show her around and introduce her. -What a choice for Ronit! -Yes. The Rai family is one of the top ten families in America. Stop this business talk! How about lunch? This is the happiest day of my life, and it's all because of you. Your wish is my command. Raj, if the Malhotras and Rais join hands, we'll become market leaders. Our stock prices will skyrocket. -I like your house, your family, -Hi! the atmosphere and particularly this interior decoration. -And Ronit? -I'm not going to tell you that. That's our secret. Let me show you your bedroom. Come. This jacket looks good on you. Raj, we're getting our daughter married because we trust you. Monishka is like a daughter to me too. I'll keep my promise. Monishka, I have to be at the gym by four. I'll call you later. Then we'll go out, okay? Which is the best disco here? Ronit knows about disco. Ask him. Where's Ronit? Should be somewhere around. Take a look. It's cold. Put it on. What's with all this drama? You people are making a fool out of me! Put on the jacket first. I won't. Okay, first cool down, then we'll talk. Go on, tell me. Do you love me? Never mind that, just put on the jacket. Let me help you. Look, Ronit... listen to me patiently. In life, there are times, when young hearts are swayed, when they fall in love and romance, without giving a damn about the consequences. Not worried about future. They begin to believe that these romantic, fairytale moments are the reality. Something like that happened to us. It was the right season, the right atmosphere, the right time. For a while, we forgot... who we were. So you were never in love? That was just an infatuation, right? Just an attraction. Ronit, you know, for me such romances are entertainment, influenced by movies. That's why you were entertaining me. You still are. Ronit. Look at me. And tell me you don't love me. I love you a lot, I did ever since my childhood. But only as a friend, like a buddy. Just like a friend? -That's it? -That's it! -Is that it? -Yes, that's it. Look at that house. Your papa, my papa, and there's Monishka. I'm telling you, she's a great girl. Isha! And yes, -I'm your best friend forever. -Come, Isha. Isha did the right thing. I know your story. She says she doesn't love me. How am I gonna fight? Who do I fight if she's... the one lying? But one day, she will admit the truth and she's gonna cry. -Ronit. -It's okay. All right. Yes, it's true, Now I'm going to do exactly what she wants me to. Ronit! As it happens in the world of love They smile while their hearts weep My heart No one knows, no one admits Don't let anyone know Where the secret ache is As it happens in the world of love They smile while their hearts weep You have betrayed me Will you ever find loyalty? You hurt me How can your pain heal? Desires rage in my bosom Like storms rising in the sea Sometimes it's the sailor Who sinks his own ship In the world of hearts, it happens We smile, while our hearts weep -What angle is that? -Triangle. That's Rohit's bedroom. Wait outside. I'll be back after I see him. -Hello! -Hello. Isha! Where are you? At Ronit's place. I was just knotting my tie and I remembered you. Where's Ronit? Inside. -I'm going to meet Mr. Rai... -Papa, I'll talk to you later. Dear... Avantika! You called at the right time! She suppressed her emotions and tried to pretend she wasn't in love then at some point, those emotions burst out as tears and the truth finally tumbles out. Yet it's true that Isha doesn't love me. Because even without me, Isha can smile... Isha can cry. Isha doesn't love me. Because she can live without me. Talk to your sister. Then why don't you say you love me? Why don't you say it? I love you! I love you a lot. I've loved you since we were in school. I loved you since we were kids. And I still love you. But you're my friend, aren't you? How can I be your lover? Sometimes, I just feel like crying. I'm sorry, I broke down. You're supposed to take Monishka to Mr. Mittal's for dinner. You don't remember a thing. Go on... I'm leaving. Where are you guys? Uncle Raj, where are you? I need to talk to you. I'm going to meet Mr. Rai at Harry's Club. Meet me there. The manager won't let me in. I need Mr. Rai to sign these papers and give it to Mr. Jagdish. Give it to me, I will get them signed for you. Stay right here, I need to talk to you. -Uncle Raj. -What happened? I just spoke to the manager. You can go in. -Go! -Should I go alone? All the rich people are in there. I was feeling a bit embarrassed. You sure, right? Scoundrels! You just need one Coke to think straight. So did you like my in-laws' party? Shameful! So what do you think? Why are you concerned about their family? Monishka will live with your family. It's not the other way around. -Okay. -Mr. Son-in-law. In that case, you gotta do me one last favor. What? I'm taking Monishka to Radisson Hampshire tonight. All you have to do is ask my fiancÃ©e three questions. Three questions? So what are your three questions? Go ahead. My dear... This is the first question from the Malhotra family. After the wedding, will you live with Ronit's parents? -Or your place? -Of course, my place. What do the parents have to do? And... they better visit only after taking an appointment. Parents too? She's from America. Life out there is so stressful and busy. Isn't it? My child, my second question is, I hear you love late night parties, and you come home late as well? That's good. That's not a problem. So even after you're married, these late nights will continue? Getting married doesn't mean giving up my friends, my independence. After we're married, she can come and go as she wishes. Why are you asking these questions when I don't mind, Uncle Raj? My third question is, Lalit says that after marriage, you should have a little baby. I've already clarified this with Ronit. I don't want a baby for at least four or five years. Because I don't want to ruin my figure. But this is a part of our culture. You have duties -towards your parents, their happiness... -Ronit! I think your uncle is from backwaters. I don't like to have discussions with a small fry like you. All I could think of you as the pimp of Malhotra family and nothing else. Monishka! Please sit down. I'll go. -No, Uncle Raj. -No, my friend. Please sit down. Nobody could do what you did today. I was fed up with these people, but how could I tell them? That I love you. Excuse me, Lalit, sister-in-law. What are you saying, Raj? It's true. I proposed this marriage. Now I'm trying to break it off. I'm telling the truth. What are you trying to break off? Ronit's engagement to Monishka. From what I've seen, neither the girl nor the family is any good for Ronit. We're getting him married just for the sake of money. Raj, I knew someday your patience would end. Patience? Before you came here, I received a call from Rai about what you've seen and what the reality is. They are rich folks, Raj. They have a different lifestyle. They're different. For a middle-class restaurateur like you, all this may be startling. Monishka's ideas aren't compatible with Ronit's. Only you are opposed to her, Raj. Didn't I always tell you, Lalit, to stay clear of this poor friend of yours? Because someday or the other, he'll show you how petty he is. Jagdish! The truth is, Raj and Shalini always had plans for your son ever since he was a boy. Ronit was like a check that was worth 50 billion. They wanted to own him. But it was Rai who cashed him. In the heat of the moment, he proposed that Monishka and Ronit get married. But it shattered his daughter Isha's dreams. She had her eyes on Ronit. Lalit, this was their scheme to break up the engagement, for Isha's benefit. But now we all know, don't we, Shelley? Do you want me to show you some photos for evidence? Would you like to see Ronit's arms snaking over Isha's waist and all over? If you were not my friend Lalit's elder brother... whom I respected as my elder brother then today and now... I would've slapped you so hard that... you'd carry my fingerprints all your life. Raj! Listen carefully, Jagdish Malhotra. Isha and Ronit love each other very much, very dearly. But they have learned to respect their elders. Because they respect you... and also for my sake... they buried their love and they wiped off their tears. And the photographs you speak of... Had they wanted they could've blown them up, and plastered them all over your house. Then... neither you... nor your father could stop that. -You're crossing the limit, Raj! -I'm heartbroken! I'm heartbroken! Let me have my say, Lalit. He has insulted our friendship. He has insulted my daughter. I swear upon my mother. I swear upon Shalini! Neither my daughter nor will I ever enter this house again. For us, you are dead! -Raj. -Forget it, man! Even you turned out to be a coward, friend! My friend, a coward! Uncle Raj! What's this, Papa? You are crying instead of consoling us. No! This won't do. Come home. There are songs There are complaints There are tales There are promises! Words are forgotten Memories return! Cherished memories of loved ones Return in our lives when they're gone. Memories! Memories! Memories! Hello, Sania, Ronit here. Give the phone to Isha. Isha isn't at home and I don't think you should call here. Isha. Attend the call and face the truth. Hello, Isha, listen to me. Listen to me carefully. We have invited 100 VIPs in the world. Two big companies are going through a merger on Monday. Children of two great families will be engaged and the wedding date will be finalized. Malhotras and Rais will climb to number two from number ten. Ronit. And yes, here's your engagement ring. See if it fits. -Come, son. -Don't call me son, madam. Ronit, I'm your mother. Sorry, ma'am, but you aren't my mother! You don't even know that your son has grown up. I'm no longer a boy with little fingers. Because you're one of those mothers who never held her son's fingers, and taught him how to walk. -Ronit? -You never even looked at your son. You never looked into my eyes, never tried to understand my anguish. You... You aren't a mother. You're just an executive director in this marketplace where relationships and emotions are cheap and expendable. I don't want to stay here. I don't want to stay where there's no mother. -Where there's no father. -Son! Don't call me son! Don't call me son! -I'm your mother. -Are you? Then save me, save your son. Save your son from the fire that your family wants to throw me into. Can you save me? You can't. You can't save me. For 40 years, I've put my blood, heart, soul and mind in building these companies. I have taken the Malhotra family into the top ten! What do you guys want now? You want the businesses that have prospered for years to be ruined? You want this house to be turned into a memorial for lovers? This is a business house and will always be a business house. If anyone tries to insult me or tries to stand in my way, I'm going to shoot him and then I'll shoot myself. Anyone who sides with Ronit will be responsible for my death. Is everyone listening? Kuldeep, this boy has rebelled. Look, Ronit. I want to meet Isha. Go on, see him. He's bleeding. Tell me. What do you want to say? Isha! Ronit! Where are you taking me? I want your decision before this world decides our fate. Are you with me or not? Ronit! We have to make a decision today. Life? Or death? -Death? -Yes, death. No! Ronit should be brought back. Only one man can compel him to attend tomorrow's function. -Who? -Only Raj. To save this 50 billion corporation, -you must overcome your vanity... -And beg? Maybe, yes. Please try to understand the gravity of the situation. I'm only asking you to accompany me. I'll talk to Raj. You needn't say a word. "Cherished memories of loved ones return after they're gone." -You know... -Well said! Yeah? Thank you. I'll be right back. Raj... Sister-in-law! -Ronit has run away. -What? -Ran away? -Maybe. Where? Ran away! He ran away! This was bound to happen! Why don't you ask Mr. Richie Rich's 500 million pound company to find the boy? Find him if you can. I know you can't. Let's sit inside and talk. You folks are his parents. Parents, period. Guardians. You don't rule him. They're lovers... they're in love! The lovers... have flown. They have fled. Oh moon! Oh stars! Listen, everyone! Oh moon! Oh stars! Listen, everyone! I think of you When I sleep, when wake up. What's the whole world Compared to your love? Oh moon! Oh stars! Listen, everyone! I think of you When I wake up, when I sleep What's the whole world Compared to your love? You and I will love each other so much You and I will love each other so much Anyone who hears will say Who has lived forever? Who lives forever? Love it was, love it will be Love it was, love it will be In your heart, in my heart In your heart, in my heart Let nothing remain unspoken Time flows like a river Let go of the riverbank Lest the waters pass us by Let go of the riverbank Lest the waters pass us by Oh, moon! Oh, stars! Listen, everyone! I think of you When I wake up, when I sleep What's the whole world Compared to your love? Memories! Great, my friend. As the girl's father, if I lodge a complaint with the police, you might land in jail. Do you know that? That's exactly what I want. If our families refuse to endorse our love... let the world decide. At 5 p.m. today, your engagement to Monishka will be officially announced. The merger agreement between the two companies will be signed. I'm not going anywhere today. -What if I ask you to go? -No chance. Ah... Oh? Your mother is on the line. Today is a historic day for the Malhotra and Rai family. Along with the merger of two great companies, two families are also entering into wedlock. After this ring ceremony, our children Ronit and Monishka, will commit themselves to married life together. Question to the chairman of our company, Mr. JKM is, to whom goes the credit for this historic day? Wait a minute. Let me come over to you. Tell us. -Go on. -Go on. Its credit goes... to all of us. All of us? Or just one? One? I mean all of us. A person, without whom, this evening wouldn't have been made possible? -Possibly. -Tell us. Raj Singh Puri. -Oh, yes, yes. Raj Singh Puri. -He said it finally. Applause. The man who has united two companies, two children. A few words for this man. Don't say it like that. Say it with an open heart. I'm saying it with an open heart. Our chairman, Jagdish, wants to present a bouquet and shawl to Mr. Raj Singh Puri. Very magnanimous of him to honor a small fry like me. I consider the honor of his family... to be my family honor. I recall a few lines my wife once wrote. "You enter life, you leave it when you enter, bring, when you leave, give away, memories, memories and memories!" There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words There are songs There are complaints There are stories There are words Words are forgotten Not the memories Words are forgotten Not the memories Memories! Thank you. Memories! Memories! Stop, Uncle Raj. Stop. Please stop. Just a while longer. Everyone made grand speeches and earned lots of brownie points. That also put us in a positive light. For the first time today, my mother has encouraged me. She called me home, told me... "Son, speak your mind and tell the truth." She told me not to hide... not to resort to lies. These people... who addressed you today... all of them lied to you. They told you blatant lies. Because this is a stage, a public place, even Satan speaks with God with dignity from a public stage. Yes, son, you're right! But you are the society, the public-at-large. Let's see... who amongst you supports the truth. I have a few questions. Each of you has the merger report, one side red and the other green. If I'm wrong, say I'm wrong. If I'm right, say I'm right. Don't you say yes, if I'm lying. Now give me a few answers. -What is he up to? -It's a public trial. My first question. Apologizing. Apologizing to fool the public when your heart is filled with venom? Is that right or wrong? Now... honor. Family honor! Turning a blind eye to the fact, that greed is the cornerstone of family honor? Is that right or wrong? Culture is the cornerstone of family honor, Uncle Raj. Not money. Now, let's turn to a love story. A girl was in love but she sacrificed her love for her father's sake. Is that right or wrong? And the boy, acceded to his father's demands and sold himself to the marketplace. And his family will force him to marry a rich heiress to jack up their company's stock market valuation. Raj, wait. So this story ends with the triumph of money. Love loses. I heard that parents... would sell themselves for their children's happiness. But today, they are selling their children for their ambitions. Money comes first... children are secondary. Is this betterment? Is this growth? Is this progress? Emotions, love, friendships, relationships, culture... they mean nothing? What gospel is this? What gospel are our elders trying to teach us? All right. All right. In a while from now... I'll slip this ring on Monishka's finger. And I'll sell myself... to this company and Monishka. But my question is... will this diamond... or a few rituals... be enough to unite two souls? Is the union complete? Speak up! Give me an answer! Am I to marry for the sake of the merger? Or should I marry the one to whom I've given my heart... and my life? Speak up! Give me an answer! I'll tell you. Monishka! Strange! You cannot answer Ronit's simple question? Because you are a part of the Globex International merger? Are you evading the truth under influence of the high and the mighty? The truth is... marriages are meant to follow hearts, not mergers. Ronit is right. Diamonds and rituals don't make a marriage. Marriage is a union of hearts and souls. I ask Ronit's true love to come on stage and in the presence of all of us here, let her give Ronit this ring. So I call upon Isha Puri, to come on stage and accept this engagement ring. -Isha Puri! -Where is she? Isha Puri! Isha Puri! Isha isn't here. Today when you wish to insult your families... you may find Sania and me to be part of this. But not Isha. She has left. Where is Isha? JKM, this merger won't take place. For the first time, the young children have made me realize, how good and honest they are... and how corrupt we are. Especially you and I. And thank you! He was the worst, yet he understood the children. And you are still thinking? Great! Papa! Papa! Papa! -Papa! -Hey! Isha! Isha. Why did you leave me? You ask me to face the truth but you decided to run away? Nalini told me something was going to happen on stage. Didn't Ronit call you to the stage? Did he call you? Tell me. I left before he could do that. Why, dear? Remember you used to say... a girl who is not accepted by the family... finds it very difficult to get respect. There's more to life than romantic love, there are other relationships... like aunt, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law. My dear! For the first time, I've seen the world through the eyes of my children. We rise in life, yet we are so petty. And I sunk to such depths that I cannot ask to be forgiven. But I do want you... to marry into my family. If you do... I will know I've been forgiven. Go. He has come to take you away. Go. Thank you, Jagdish. Raj Singh's story doesn't end here. He stayed a friend to the children, till the very end, even when he became a grandfather. Supriya. Supriya! Where are you, Supriya? Supriya will go for a walk with me. Then she'll return home. Then she will exercise. Later, she will have a bath and pray. After that I'll take her to school. And in the evening, we'll go out. -Where are you, dear? -I'm here, grandpa. My beautiful baby. Where is Avantika, your mother? Everyone has gone out, left me. Mother, father, uncle, aunt. Everyone left you, but I'm with you. -Your grandpa. -Grandpa, will you be my best friend? You mean friend-grandpa? Dear, did you hear that? Look at this. She too... All right, dear. Give me your hand. From today, I'm your friend-grandpa. Let's go. Wait a minute. First let me take the keys. What do you want to ask? Grandpa, when did my parents get married? Six years ago. -Uncle Ronit and Aunt Isha? -Four years ago. When are you getting me married? Tell me! Please!
