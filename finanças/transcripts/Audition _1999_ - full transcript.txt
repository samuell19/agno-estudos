DEAR MUM, GET WELL SOON. Tell the head nurse to stay. Ryoko. Ryoko. Good afternoon. I'm sorry. 5:27pm. I brought this for Mum. SEVEN YEARS LATER Let's go home. The sea is too rough. No luck again, eh, Dad? You don't understand. I'm only after the big ones. I prefer real girls to imaginary big fish. When you're older, you'll understand about love. Hello? Yes, I've finished the plan. I'll bring it tomorrow. Yes. Hello? Sorry, I have to go. This is too big for us. Weâ€™ll give some to Rie. You haven't invited any friends over recently. Are you OK? Did you know all black sea breams start off as males? At 15cm long, they become hermaphrodites, then they become male or female. How about this one? We saw its ovaries, didn't we? Did we? I don't know much about ovaries. Dad, you've been looking worn out recently. You don't look well. Gangu! Look, Dad, why don't you marry again? That's a bit out of the blue. How else could I have put it? Thanks for dinner. It's your turn today. This looks just like a cult ceremony. Maybe it is. They're lonely. Happy people don't go there. Everybody in Japan is lonely. Are you? Aren't you? Excuse me, sir. Mr Ueno wants to change tomorrow's meeting to 3:30pm. That's fine. I'll be in all day anyway. I'll drop in at Starts and then meet Yoshikawa tonight. I won't be back today. If there's an emergency, I'll call you on your mobile. Excuse me... I'm going to get married. Really? Congratulations. Who is it? You don't know him. Well, I wish you all the best. - You busy? - Yeah, business is OK. Profits are shrinking, though. - And you? - Me? Don't you know? - Recession doesn't affect films. - Really? I'm joking. It's a game of survival, an endurance test. - Any plans? - Yeah, too many. Hope we survive to see them through. Yoshikawa, didn't you say the same thing a year ago? Did I? Awful girls, common, full of themselves. Stupid, all of them. Where are the nice ones? Japan is finished. Look... I might get married again. Glad to hear it, at last. Who to? I don't know yet. My son told me I'd better remarry because I look worn out. So I will. You look worn out? Will you have an arranged marriage? No, I wouldn't like that. I wish a gorgeous woman were hiding somewhere. Look, what kind of woman are you looking for? A young one? No, a mature woman, preferably. Maybe a career woman with some accomplishments. Accomplishments? Playing the piano, for instance, singing or dancing. Your wife Ryoko was like that, wasn't she? Properly trained people are confident. People who lack confidence depend on others and can't find happiness. A pianist? She'll cost you a fortune. I don't mean a successful professional. I just don't want to make a mistake at my age. I want time to get to know her really well. See lots of women, so I can find one that's perfect. What? Am I asking too much? I must be. No. Well, there is a way to do that. An audition. A romantic story. Remember a documentary you made a while ago? About an ex-ballet dancer, her patron and a sick boy? The one we made with a German TV station? I had the story rewritten. Any problems? No, but will you really set up an audition? Leave it to me. Have I ever disappointed you? No, but... The heroine will be between 20 and 35. And she must have some accomplishments. Perfect, isn't it? But wait. Wouldn't it be fraud? This isn't just to find you a wife, it's for a real film. If we can fund it. The story isn't bad. But listen... Am I supposed to marry the lead girl? Oh, no, a girl of that talent wouldn't marry you. She wouldn't be the marrying type. The ones who get to the final but don't get the part, there will be some gems among them. Maybe 10 out of 1,000 applicants. You'd take her out, and she'd turn heads. She'd be clever, well-mannered, good-natured, and accomplished in traditional arts. Someone you'd like for your son. I don't get it. Why would a girl like that not get the part? Because she wouldn't be unhappy. Unhappy girls have more to express as actresses. And another thing. I'm going to use this for an FM station. The programme's called "Tomorrow's Heroine". Just leave it to me. I'm a professional auditioner. Hi, this is Yoshikawa in Room 2. Is coffee OK? - Coffee for you? - Yeah. Two coffees, please. Yeah, I'm stuck in traffic, but I won't be too late. Give the tape to Kaneda. Yes. Yeah. Thanks. Tomorrow's Heroine, I wonder where you are. Incredible things can happen if you have a bit more courage. Stars were not stars right from the beginning. Audrey Hepburn, Julia Roberts... Even these stars used to be ordinary girls. Tomorrow's Heroine is living just like you today. Tomorrow's Heroine, it could be you. I'm home. You're home early. Yeah, I've got to work at home tonight. You just need to heat up your dinner. The bigger dish is for Shigehiko. Thanks. See you on Monday. My daughter's coming this weekend. I'm going shopping. Sounds nice. Hey, Gangu. And please put your washing in the basket. Goodbye. Bye. - Thank you very much. - OK! - Hello, Aoyama speaking. - It's me. Yoshikawa, I'm just looking through the forms. Difficult to choose? That's right. How on earth can I...? It's as hard as choosing my first car. How can you compare the two? The audition will be next week. Choose thirty girls by then. - Thirty girls? - Yeah. All right. I'll ring you back. And don't just go by the photos, read the essays carefully. I'll do that. - See you. - Bye. Well, well, thirty girls out of all these? Oh, you're home. You could knock at least. Have you just got in? Do you want dinner now? I'll eat mine later. Don't wait for me. OK. Listen... I've got a friend here. A girl? You can offer her my dinner. Thanks. Clumsy oaf! Asami Yamazaki... 12 YEARS TRAINING IN CLASSICAL BALLET "I'm not sure whether I could become an actress. Probably not. "I was simply fascinated by the story. "I was training to be a ballet dancer "until I damaged my hip at 18. "I was devastated as I was just about to train in London. "Ballet had been the most important thing to me and I no longer had it. "In a sense, it was similar to accepting death. "To live means to approach death gradually. "I have learned that by my own experience. "This is why I'm applying." - When did this dinosaur live? - Sometime in the late Cretaceous. The late Cretaceous? That's... ...when parasaurolophus lived! Correct! Have you seen a model of the dinosaur? - No! - Do you want to see it? Yeah! Good evening. I'm his father. I'm Misuzu Takagi. Nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you. I see her on the way to school. She looked pretty, so I spoke to her. Good for you. I'm interested in biology too, so I wanted to see his books. - We've eaten yours. - OK. What? Was that your father's dinner? Oh, I've eaten your dinner! I'm sorry. Let me cook you something. - No, don't worry. - But... - I'm going out anyway. - I see. Gangu! Good boy. We're going walkies in a minute. - You'll see her home, won't you? - Of course I will. Come on, Gangu, we're going. Come on! Are you ready? Well, I feel like a criminal. I'm ready now. Let's go! Good morning. Take a seat. I'm Yu Tanaka. Pleased to meet you. Sit down, please. - Are you nervous? - Yes, a little bit. Of course. You're the first one. - Do you mind if we tape you? - No. May I ask what your father does? Well, my father's job is... How shall I put it? Next! I'll be direct. What made you apply for this audition? Have you had loveless sex? Are you into drugs? Favourite character? Could you give us a demonstration? - All right. - Go on. Your favourite thing? - Your favourite actress? - I adore Mitsuko Mori. Next. I loved sports, so at school I joined... Would you work in the sex industry? Well, one of my friends does. Next! What are men to you? Have you seen a film by Tarkovsky? Ren Osugi. Would you do sex scenes? No problem. Are you psychic? 28 - ASAMI YAMAZAKI Next. May I ask you a question? Laugh for us. What kind of men do you hate? I'm Yoko Sugiwara. Nice to meet you. You can't be a big star without confidence. Excuse me. No, I'm busy at the moment. Since I was two, my mother's been determined to make me famous. Just walk around, please. And turn. Next, please. Thank you. Excuse me. It's break time. Are you taking one? We're running 30 minutes late. - Let's have a 10-minute break. - All right. Why aren't you asking questions? You're not losing interest now, are you? No, I'm not. Why, then? I'm nervous myself. I'm going to the toilet. I lived in Paris for three years. I'm back in Tokyo, and work as a designer. All I want to do is be an actress. My ex-agent specialised in porn videos. I'll use her for another part. Being a famous cover girl wasn't enough for me. This is my first suicide attempt and this is the second. I've been in a psychiatric hospital three times. Next. I'm Emi Kitani. Pleased to meet you. Eh? Haven't we interviewed you already? Yes, but I've got more to say. You have a good career. Why leave it? I couldn't do as well as I'd hoped. I did my best, but... Excuse me. I'm a paediatric nurse. I have to work so hard, but... Next. Next is Miss Asami Yamazaki. Come in. I'm Asami Yamazaki. Please take a seat. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - Not at all. Have you ever been in a film or on TV? I haven't, though I've had several offers. Do you belong to an agency? No, but a director of a record company looks after me personally. I haven't been in touch with him for a while. Which company is it? Ace Records. What's his name? Mr Shibata, from Japanese Department 2. You say you've been unemployed since you left your last job. How do you pay your bills, if you don't mind telling us? I work for my friend three times a week. What does your friend do? She runs a small bar in Ginza. I met her in a voice-training class. I can cope if I'm not extravagant. Don't you want to be? I don't want to be poor, but I'm happy if I can afford to buy books and CDs. Can I ask about your ballet? Of course. - You say you damaged your hip. - That's right. It must've been hard to give up something you were devoted to. Yes. Excuse me if I sound intrusive. In your essay you said giving up what was most important to you was in a sense similar to accepting death. I was most impressed. Everyone has had similar experiences. You are bound to have to give up something precious in your life and there's nothing you can do but accept that fact. That's life. I mean... I was amazed that a girl as young as you understands that. I could tell that you take life very seriously and always have done. Thank you very much. Have you any more to say? Thank you very much for coming. We may get in touch later. Thank you very much. Can I call the next one? - We're having a 15-minute break. - All right. - Will you tell Mr Ito that I'll be late? - All right. - What do you think of her? - She makes me nervous. I want a cigarette. You'd already decided on her then? Her essay caught my eye. Now I've seen her, I like her all the more. "I could tell that you have always taken life very seriously." An auditioner doesn't say that. I was shocked. Don't have a go at me, I really thought so. She does look like she takes life very seriously. She looks prettier than the photo, like a nice girl. But I feel anxious. What do you mean, anxious? Yeah, I don't know why. I can't put my finger on it, but something's wrong with her. That girl seems nice, doesn't she? You mean Misuzu? She's not exactly what she seems. She's so complex. I'm scared of women. Nonsense. Thanks for dinner. Dad, about you remarrying... Choose someone who cooks better than Rie. What's the hurry? They've dug up a new species of dinosaur in Argentina that might be older than the eureptile. - Really? - I've got so much to find out. And have a bath! Hello? Hello, sorry to disturb you so late. This is Aoyama, the producer. I interviewed you today. Thank you for your time today. My pleasure. I... I just wonder if I could talk to you if you can spare some time. Yes, of course. I'd love to. When can you make it? Anytime. I'm free during the day. Are you? How about...? Good night. Hello, Aoyama speaking. It's me. Oh, what's up? Well... it's about Miss Yamazaki. I rang Ace Records, just to check. It might not be important, but something seems to be wrong. What's that? There is no Mr Shibata in Japanese Department 2. Or rather, there isn't any more. Well, this Shibata went missing 18 months ago. He just disappeared. I feel a bit nervous. I'm not going to ask you any questions. Just relax. All I have to do is chat and enjoy nice food? Absolutely. That's the best offer I've ever had. Well, just one thing... That director who's looking after you personally. You mean Mr Shibata? I'm sorry. I made you think he's my agent. To be honest, I've never met him. I was told it'd be better to pretend I had a contact. I see. I didn't mean to lie. Oh, don't worry. At least it all makes sense now. Here we are. Looks wonderful. Go ahead. - Delicious. - Yes, it is. I hope I'm not asking too much, but could we do this again? Of course, only if you have time. It's so nice of you to do this for me. I haven't got anyone I can trust and confide in. My pleasure. If I'm of any use. Really? Oh, I'm so happy. I won't bother you, I promise. I don't mind where we meet, or if it's only over the phone. I've written my mobile number on the business card I gave you. Ring me any time. Thank you so much. Thanks for the lovely meal, too. I've made up my mind. I'm sorry, but I'm not at all interested in the film or any other girl. It doesn't matter whether the film goes ahead or not. But don't be too hasty. You wanted time to get to know her. Just tell me exactly what's wrong with her. Well, I just don't believe that life can be that easy. She's pretty, sophisticated, intelligent and good-natured. A single girl like that falls bang into our little scheme? I don't believe it. I've tried to check out her background, but I couldn't. We don't even know where she works. In short, we don't know anyone who knows her. Don't treat me like a child. I'm not that easily deceived. I trust my own judgement rather than other people's. Even if she causes trouble, I can handle it. Sure, you can. You were right, I've found my ideal woman at the audition. I appreciate your help, Yoshikawa. Aoyama! Promise me one thing. Don't ring her for a while. Maybe I'm wrong about her, but this is about your life. It's best not to be too hasty. Cool down a bit. All right. I promise I will. Are you ill? You don't usually take a day off like this. Actually, you've never done this before. Everyone needs a rest. You must be tired. You've brought up Shigehiko on your own since your wife died. You've set up and expanded your own company. Maybe you've worked too hard. I wish my husband were as efficient as you so I didn't have to work. You've got a nice lady friend, haven't you? Of course, you have. A man needs a woman to support him or he'd exhaust himself. I'm going home now. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. I'm going home now. See you. Is something wrong? No. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. This is Aoyama. Oh... I'm so glad. I thought you'd never ring me again. You may think I'm a clingy sort of woman... ...but I've been waiting and waiting for your call. I'm sorry. Well, how have you been? What's the matter? What's so funny? I thought I'd never see you again. I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling. Excuse me. I didn't ask you about your family at the interview. How are they? They're fine. They live in Tokyo, is that right? They just bought a house in Chiba and moved in last month. My father wanted to be near a golf course. We're not that close, but we don't quarrel either. Just average, I think. Do you still work at the bar? Yes. In Ginza? Yes, in the 4th District. It's got a funny name, the Stone Fish. The Stone Fish? Can I go there sometime? I'd love that, but the owner is... She's nice, but she interferes in my private life. I won't go there if you don't want me to. I just want to know more about you. I wouldn't lie to you, Mr Aoyama, ever. I swear. Look... About the film we're going to make... Another girl's got the lead, right? No, it's the film itself. The backer didn't like part of the script. The film's likely to be postponed. Or rather... the film may never get the go-ahead after all. Oh, I see. You must have had a hard time. Not really, but I suppose you will. You read my essay, didn't you? I was sure that I wouldn't get the lead. I'm all right. I think I'm lucky to have met you. I feel refreshed and serene when I see you. I feel as if I were part of a beautiful thing or image. Like when I used to dance, I shed all my troubles with sweat. That was how I got through the difficult lessons. But it's all over now, I've lost ballet forever. It'll be hard to get over, but one day you'll find life is wonderful. That's why we all carry on with our lives. Thank you. I've been on my own all my life. I've never had anyone to talk to. There were men who approached me, but I've never met anyone like you, so warm and comforting. You understand and accept me. No one has ever done that before. Can we have dinner together again soon? Great. When? I've forgotten my manners. I'll give you a ring. I look forward to that. I'll get out here. Please stop here. She's getting out. Thank you very much for a lovely day. See you soon. - Goodnight. - Bye. Take me to Okusawa, please. Come in. Shigehiko, can I talk to you now? What about? Well, well. The curtains need cleaning. What? Well, I... Have found a girlfriend. Am I right? How did you know? You've been behaving oddly. You often smile for no apparent reason. She's only 24. She's closer to my age. She's beautiful, I presume. I chose a beautiful one, as you did. She must be cheating on you. I'm more experienced than you are. Have you proposed? Not yet. We're going away this weekend. - I'm going to ask her then. - Good luck. I'll introduce her to you soon. She'll be OK if I think she is. You're in love so you can't think straight. Well, what shall we do before dinner? They've got a good chef here. The food's delicious and simple. The chef's very good, but he's got a sharp tongue. Oh, yes, there's a nice little gallery nearby. If we leave now, weâ€™ll just manage to get in before it closes. It's about 20 minutes by car. After the gallery, we can go to the harbour. It's only small, but there's an excellent coffee shop which serves nice cheesecakes, as well as good desserts. Come here. Please. Don't take your clothes off yet. Look... ...at my body. When I was young, I burnt myself by accident. I want you to know everything about me. You... are beautiful. Love me and nobody else. I will. They all say that. But you are different, aren't you? Love me alone. Promise? Love no one else but me. Hello? Is that Mr Aoyama? This is reception. Yes. I'm terribly sorry to disturb you. I rang several times, but there was no answer. Your companion has left. Therefore we need you to confirm your stay. I know it's late, forgive me. She's left? Do you mean she's disappeared? She's not answering the phone. I don't know how to contact her. She never let me see her home. I don't know where she lives. - What happened in the hotel? - I told you. A woman doesn't disappear because of that! There must've been some misunderstanding. I've got to talk to her, face to face. Can't you find out her address? Aoyama, I've only got her CV. It's impossible. Look... it's best if you forget her. I can't. I can't forget her like that. I know you won't listen to me, but it would be best for you not to see her again. What...? Are you... suggesting I'm a silly old fool... ...who lost his head over a young girl and then got jilted? Looks like it. What's come over you? You yourself said you were not a child. You could handle any trouble she caused. What's the matter with you? Oh, Aoyama! - Forget it. - Forget what? Just forget it. I don't need help. I'll find her. - Leave me alone! - Aoyama! 12 YEARS OF CLASSICAL TRAINING AT SHIMADA BALLET STUDIOS SHIMADA BALLET STUDIOS Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me. Are you... ...Mr Shimada? I rang up earlier today. I'd like to ask you about Asami Yamazaki. Go away. I know I'm intruding, but can I ask if you've ever had trouble with Asami? I just want to know how I can contact her. I thought you might be able to help. Have you seen her? Yes. Have you heard her voice? What do you mean? Have you touched her body? Have you made love to her? How was it? Was it good? Did you smell her? Asami... Go away. The Stone Fish in the 4th District. THE STONE FISH No one's there. Are they on holiday? It closed down more than a year ago. The owner was murdered. What a mess! Do you know a girl called Asami who worked here? Asami? Can't remember. The owner was mostly on her own. Asami used to help out three times a week. There must be some mistake. Excuse me, do you know why the owner was murdered? Well, they say it had something to do with her lover. She was going out with a music director, and she was using drugs. Was she murdered here? Yes, and the body was cut up. See, the floor's tilted as it was built 28 years ago, so the blood poured into the hall. And there was something very odd. When the police gathered up the pieces, they discovered there were three extra fingers, an extra ear and a tongue. It's a scary world, isn't it? Gangu! Dinnertime! Bye. Hi, this is Shigehiko. I'm staying with a friend, so I won't be home today. Make sure you eat properly, Dad. At least have some of the yoghurt. And feed Gangu when he comes out of hiding, please. Bye, then. I'm sorry. Well, how have you been? I thought I'd never see you again. I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling. I've never asked you about your family. How are they? My parents got divorced when I was small. I went to live with my uncle. It was terrible there. All I remember is being abused. My uncle's wife was an abusive person. I was always covered in cuts and bruises. Don't talk about it, if it's painful for you. No, I want you to know everything about me. She made me have cold baths in winter and I got pneumonia. She pushed me down the stairs once and I broke my shoulder. The doctor got worried. So eventually, I went back to live with my mother. How old were you? I was about 7. I see. My mother had remarried. I had no more injuries... ...but my stepfather, he just hated me. He was disabled and couldn't walk, so he was home all the time. Every day after school, I hid in a dark room until my mother came home. I never turned on the lights or made a sound. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be telling you such a bizarre story. Just tell me if I've put you off. It's strange. You've suffered so much, but you don't show it. I think ballet saved me. You had a talent. I don't know why but dancing calmed and purified my ugly feelings. That's probably why I didn't kill myself, though my life was terrible. I think you're wonderful. I've been looking for a woman like you. Darling? Ryoko? What good timing. I want you to meet Miss Asami Yamazaki. Don't... Don't marry her. She's very nice. No. Not her. Darling. I want you. Asami... It was a mistake, wasn't it? You made love to me. Once. I thought it would lead somewhere. What a fool! I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'll do anything to please you. I like this. What are you doing? Stop! Would you look at that? Stop it! Three extra fingers, an extra ear and a tongue. You'll love only me, won't you? Only me. Asami... Dance for me. Dance. Dance, you bitch! If you don't dance, I'll punish you... ...like I always do. Dance. Dance for me, please! Dance, please! Dance! Asami. Good girl. Asami! This wire cuts through bones so easily. You're wonderful. I never felt unhappy really. Because I never stopped being unhappy! Asami. Stop. Don't! Men need women to support them, or they'll exhaust themselves. How about... setting up an audition? My son said I'd better marry again because I looked worn out. That's why I'm looking for a wife. Asami... You... You are paralysed. You can't move, but your nerves are alive. That way, your skin becomes very sensitive to pain. You call a lot of girls to the audition, reject them, then ring them up later to have sex with them. You are all the same. Deeper, deeper. Does it hurt? All words are lies. But pain doesn't lie. See? When you're in pain, you see your own shape clearly. Deeper. This is the most sensitive spot in the stomach. You see. Here as well. Here, too. See? Deeper, deeper. Deeper, deeper. You see, these bits under the eyes are very sensitive too. Only pain and suffering will make you realise who you are. Only when you're in extreme pain, do you understand your own mind. Your son is called Shigehiko, isn't he? If he suffers, you'll understand much more clearly. Don't touch... ...Shigehiko. See, you love him too. You said you'd love only me. Lies. I truly have nobody else, but you've got others. I don't want to be one of them. Even if I give you my entire self, you'll never give me yours. You're all the same. Every single one of you. You can't go anywhere without your feet. This wire cuts through bones so easily. Stop it. Don't... Right foot next. Hello! Are you still up, Dad? My friend suddenly got sick. We had to call an ambulance. It was chaos. Are you in bed? Dad, what's happened? What's going on? What's the matter? Are you all right? Well... I... You've asked me... I've decided to accept... ...your proposal. My proposal? I can't believe it. Am I allowed to be so happy? Out of all the girls... ...that went to the audition... ...I must be the luckiest. I didn't become the heroine of a film, but of real life. Deeper, deeper. Dad, what's happened? Who are you? What are you doing? Stop it! Dad! Dad, are you OK? Dad! Police... Call the police. Hello, police? This is Aoyama, at 6-20 Okusawa. Please send an ambulance immediately. My dad's badly injured. And so is a woman. I don't know what's happened. His left foot is severed, and he's bleeding badly. Yes. Yes. The address is 6-20-4 Okusawa, Setagaya. I thought you were busy. I don't understand your business. You may think I'm a clingy sort of woman, but I've been waiting and waiting for your call. I thought I'd never see you again. I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling. I've been on my own all my life. I've never had anyone to talk to. I've never met anyone like you, so warm and comforting. You understand and accept me. No one ever did. It'll be hard to get over, but you'll find life is wonderful, one day. That's why we all carry on with our lives.
