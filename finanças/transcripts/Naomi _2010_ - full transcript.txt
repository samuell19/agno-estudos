July August Productions and EZ Films Present A film by Eitan Zur Based on the novel: "Hitparzut X" by Edna Mazya NAOMI Based on the theory of the gravitational interaction between two masses which revolve around one another, I would like to describe what could happen when two stars get so close as to reach physical contact. This is what it looks like when an older star sucks matter out of its younger partner, forming a funnel-like shape known as an Accretion Disc. Hi, Davis Where are you going? The meeting is upstairs. Ilan! You have reached the home of Naomi and Ilan Ben-Natan. Leave a message. Hi, this is Naomi Ben-Natan Please leave a message Thank you. Naomi? Naomi? Hi, this is Naomi Ben-Natan. Design: Naomi Ben-Natan Hello? Where did you put the electric bill? I have to give it to Anton's mother In the breadbox Who puts bills in the breadbox? - I do Why didn't you come to Hansey's funeral? - I couldn't. Well, the whole neighborhood was there Shimmi Leder even came from Beer Sheba Well, I'm sorry. She wasn't only our neighbor for 60 years. She was your teacher, too. Mom, leave me alone. Why are you edgy? I'm not edgy. Just drop it, okay? What happened? Nothing. What's supposed to happen? What? Nothing. Naomi's not home You're at it again? She said she'd be at home. So she said. She's probably with a girlfriend. She doesn't have girlfriends in Haifa. She has that homosexual. He's abroad So she's out shopping What's with you? What's wrong with worrying about my wife? Well, Ilan, If you didn't want to worry, you shouldn't have married a 28 year old eye candy. Thank you very much Hello? Don't take tranquillizers if you're drinking! Hello? Hi. Hi. You sound disappointed. No, not disappointed. I'm just a bit upset. Naomi should have been home by now and with all this rain... I heard you didn't go to Hansey's funeral, either. I really got it from my mother - Me, too. Tawfik said they complained about us endlessly Who? - "Who"? Are you listening? Oh, she's back We'll talk tomorrow. Meet you for lunch? - Bye. You're here. Great. You said you were coming home late... I called, but you forgot your cell phone. Yes, I know. I was sure you'd be home. I took a break. Noam called and wanted to see me... Isn't he abroad? - He came back hysterical So I went to see him. But I worked non-stop, since 9 in the morning Great You're soaking wet. Yes, there was nowhere to park, and it started to pour... I filled up the bathtub for you. You can add some hot water. You ran me a bath? You are such a sweetheart. Thanks What happened to him? Who? - Noam. Oh, nothing. False alarm. I saw the book cover. It's fabulous. Do you really think so? - No, I'm just saying so What's so fabulous? Besides the fact that I drew it? I'm no pro, you know. - You have your opinion when we go to art exhibitions. It's alive. The characters are dynamic. There's humor... But let me have another look. Maybe I'll find something bad to say. Do you really find it interesting? It's yours... What do you want to eat? I didn't go shopping I did. Really? I went shopping, I ran you a bath. Elementary, my dear. Aren't you going to answer? Hello? Did the "lost goods" show up? - Yes. Did you see the pipe you bought me, by any chance? I gave it to Noam. He wants to quit smoking. Without asking me? I'm sorry. You hadn't touched it in two years. I'll get it back for you. - Forget it Do you forgive me? - Always How are Mary and the kids? I see... She's planning a "surprise" trip to Italy for my sixtieth birthday. So now I have to act both surprised and happy. If Naomi would surprise me like that, I would. Yes. Well, I said I'd be there at two. The body isn't going anywhere, is it? Bye. If Naomi would surprise me, I'd be overjoyed, too. You're jealous? Of course I'm jealous. How not to be? Look at your life and look at mine Poor soul. I have to run. I've got some Norwegians waiting. I completely forgot. - It's on me. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Can I suggest something? No. You came to me, didn't you? So? Don't do anything. Let it f'izzle out by itself And what if it doesn't? She won't leave someone like you. You didn't see them So what's the alternative? To talk to her? You want to force her to choose? Stop being so melodramatic. You're a scientist, not an actress At least, you used to be. I don't know what to do. Write your book. That's what you should do Are you joking? Naomi fell in love with a famous scientist, not a ridiculous lovesick puppy You're smothering her. No wonder she went looking for some fresh air I'm speaking my mind. That's the way I am. Stop patronizing me! I'm 80 years old. I won't change anymore Go change your clothes The last thing you need now is the flu I don't know why I even came here. "Technion" Hi. Hi. Are you all right? I'm fine I'm going to take a shower. "From: Oded Safra." "So get away from him I'll be at The Wharf Come on" So what are your plans? I don't have any. How about you? I thought I'd go see a movie with Noam. Actually, I'm hungry. What did you say? It doesn't matter You mentioned Noam? No... We said we might go see a movie. No problem. I can make myself a sandwich No. I'll make us something. - Are you sure? Yes. - What about Noam? Some other time. We can go out to eat. Okay Where? The Tunisian? Okay Do want to go somewhere else? - No, the Tunisian is fine. They liked the book cover in Tel Aviv We like it in Haifa too But it might not be published by Passover. That's too bad. No one buys books after the holidays. Ilan, the Tunisian is that way! - Shit. So take the next turn It will take hours to go back now Don't exaggerate. This is Haifa... Why don't we just drive over to the port? Why go to the port? We could eat at The Wharf. Anton says we must try their smoked trout with white horseradish. I don't want fish. But you wanted to go to the Tunisian I thought you wanted fish. I don't feel like going to The Wharf. Why? I just don't feel like it - Why? You never feel like not going somewhere? Well, if you really wanted something and I just had some vague feeling against it, I'd give in. You want The Wharf? So be it. Let's sit there. - Why not here? It's crowded. - And there it isn't? Please. Thank you. Smoked trout with white horseradish and a salad Fried mullet with fries, please. - Any starters? Not for me. Naomi? Starters? - Oh. No thanks. We didn't order wine. Do you want wine? Yes. White or red? I don't care. - Me neither. White. Dry? Yes. Do you have a wine list? We'll take the Orvieto. I hope you' II like the wine You started buying? - I gave in. Do you have a light? Why should I? Can I have a light? Can I try? - I guess it's empty. A matter of experience Professor Ben-Natan, right? Have we met? I saw your lecture series on television. Fascinating So YOU were the one who saw it! I like science explained with human analogies. Some academic people are boring on purpose. They must be jealous at the Technion. - Why? You're more successful. You're on television. Thank you. - You're welcome. Please. Thank you. A toast? - To us Are you okay? You look flushed. It's hot in here. Excuse me, can I ask you something? - Not now Aren't you Ilan Ben... something... - Ben-Natan No, not Ben-Natan. Ben-Navi? Ben-Natan You're mixing me up with someone else Isn't your mother that eccentric Kraut? Yes... but I don't know you. Does the name Baruch Goldwin ring a bell? No. I'll give you a clue. Nahariya No. I don't think... The bed-wetters camp in Nahariya? Look, we're eating now, so... Sorry. Sorry. But you remember, don't you? We were 14 I remember, okay? Sorry for butting in like that. When I saw you, all the memories came back. Listen. This really isn't the time now. Sorry. Really. My apologies. I hope it's okay that I mentioned it in front of your daughter... It wasn't tactless, was it? Excuse me, sir. Oh Sorry Go ahead Please. Bon appetit. - Thank you. Please. Bon appetit. To us I decided to present the numeric analysis published by the group in Chicago who studied this phenomenon. When the layer of Helium enveloping a young star reaches the older star, the helium is compressed, heats up and causes a thermo-nuclear explosion An X-ray Burst. I'm sorry. Something came up... I'll be right back. Hi. You're not in class? No. I was just going to the bathroom. Oh I was going to leave a message. What? I'm going to Tel Aviv. They rescheduled the meeting. Drive carefully. I'll see you tonight I'll be home late, too. Well, I thought I'd stay with Alona and Yoni tonight. I don't feel like driving at night. Take the train I'II pick you up No. No need. Go back to class. Oh, and I baked a cake, you can have 2 pieces in compensation for sleeping alone tonight. Okay? Bye. Kisses. - Bye. Professor Am I interrupting? - Just the opposite. She's not here? - No. She went to her girlfriend in Tel Aviv She's staying there tonight She doesn't tell you where she goes? Did you expect to meet her here? You came for a reason, didn't you? Would you like a drink? Okay What? Whatever you're having. Have a seat. She told you. No. So how did you know where I live? And last night at the restaurant? I see You can't fight your nature, I guess. This is where you live? - When I'm in the country. I'm abroad half the time I'm filming nature films for zoology departments in America That's what I can afford right now. Reimbursing debts. When are you going abroad again? I don't know yet. What does it depend on? Naomi? I'm glad you came. Why? We might as well know where we stand, right? You seem to be interested in that, too Otherwise, you wouldn't have come She's planning on leaving me? You'll have to ask her. I can tell you what I'm planning. If you're interested. I tried to capture her... evasiveness, but I'm not talented enough to express such a masterpiece How long has this been going on? Four months Should I tell her you're here? - No. Isn't that why you came? Don't answer. Professor, what do you want? What are your intentions? You said you could tell me... Are you sure you want to know? Let's put it this way. Naomi is the only woman in the world I want to wake up with every morning And I've been around, believe me. And her? According to what she says... she feels the same way But she has... tenderness for you She doesn't want to hurt you. She said you were not using it anymore. You should be proud of her recycling old gifts. The world is bursting with excess objects Do you have a lighter? What? - A lighter "Naomi" Oded? Hello. - Hello. Is everything all right? Yes. I was fishing here. Here? Yes, this is a f'ishing wharf, isn't it? It was. Now, it's a private area. I still come and fish here sometimes. At night... Yes. I was just packing up my stuff You fish here, in this cold? I love fishing. Do you eat the fish? Yes. With the pollution here? Can I see an ID please? Professor A doctor? No. At the Technion My uncle's a professor, too. Goodbye. I'll go home now. Professor! Professor! Where are you going? To the Carmel. Do me a favor Take her to Nesher - But I'm... She forgot to turn off the stove. - I'm not... It's on your way. Do me a favor Thanks Who is it? - It's me. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? So? What happened? Not from the bottle! What happened? Did she leave you? No. So what happened? Dear God, you wake me up in the middle of the night. At least talk I killed him. Speak clearly. I can't hear you. I killed him. Who? Him. What do you mean? He's dead. You... Yes. How did you kill him? What does that matter? He attacked you. - No. So you... Yes. Where is he? In the car. Here? Outside? - Yes. Did anybody see you? No... I don't think so. So what are you going to do now? Who are you calling? Anton. Don't be stupid. You're not going to rot in jail. Give me the phone. Why turn yourself in? You're afraid it'll happen to you again? You think you' re a danger to society? No. You'll come to an arrangement with your scruples later. Don't think about yourself Think about Naomi. But we've no time for discussion... We have work to do What work? We have to get rid of the corpse No corpse, no crime I tried Well, not hard enough I'm going to get dressed. Get up Where are we going? Come on. I'll explain on the way "Hansey Bauer" Get up Just get up. Don't think about anything. Just do what I tell you. Now set him down so we can put the bricks back in place. At least Hansey finally found a man to sleep with. Hello. You've reached Oded Safra... I don't like that actor so much. Do you like him? Who? Hello? May I speak with Ilan Ben-Natan? Yes. Who's calling? The police Just a minute Ilan, it's for you. The police Yes. - Hello, Ilan Ben-Natan? Speaking. Detective Anton Karam would like to speak to you I'm putting him on Hello? You forgot how to dial? - Hey, they got me a secretary You disappeared What's up? - Nothing. Anyway, Mary is making a surprise party for my mother. Saturday at seven Okay Got it You know her Always surprising someone. I see. At least we'll get to see you. - Fine. So... Is that Anton? - Yes. I need him for a minute Hold on. Naomi wants you Anton. Hi, Naomi. - How are you? Great. - How's Mary? Hello. Have you been here long? Did they fix the radio? What? Oh, I don't know I don't work here. He was here earlier. I should have told him to bring parts Who? It's too bad I didn't tell him Are you talking about the woman who was here? He asked what to bring me from Africa. He's shooting a nature film there Instead of telling him to bring me parts, I told him not to ride horses because he was born with a bad back. Who? What happened? I'm hungry. Should I get you something? A cup of tea and cake? Which cake? I don't know. I'll go find out Hi. I fell asleep. What? Did something happen? It's sad to see you like that Like what? You seem upset Is it because of me? Not at all. I just. Don't feel so good these past few days. What do you feel, exactly? A bit weak. Listless. Do you want to see the doctor? No. It will pass. Do you know what I've been thinking? Maybe we should move. We could rent a house in the countryside, with a big studio for you Remember how you loved that place in Kerem Maharal? How did this come up all of a sudden? You don't have to decide now Think about it. You won't give me a hint? What date is it today? I totally forgot. How can someone forget his own birthday? They never celebrated my birthdays So when Anton had a birthday, it counted for me, too. Why didn't they? My mother had other things on her mind Once, she told me that she wasn't such a great mother That she had "other things on her mind". But when I asked her what kind of things, she said she didn't want to talk about it She's right Why discuss the past? She's all right now. And your father? - What about him? Was he on her mind? Not really. So what was on her mind? Work? That too. Jewelry? Girlfriends? Men? Really? Your mother? I would never have guessed. She doesn't look like one who'd... What do you mean, "men"? Tell me. She had several. My father used to call them "friends." They would come, drink a cup of tea. And then my father would take me to the park or to the movies... What? It's not as bad as it sounds And it wasn't all the time Your father accepted it? He didn't have a choice. - Why? She didn't want him. She wanted him to leave, but he didn't want to go. He begged her to let him stay. So that was her condition He loved her that much? I guess so. How come you never told me? I don't really like thinking about it Did Anton know? Of course. We grew up like brothers, you know. What? - Nothing. Why are you looking at me like that? Because I like you. All this is for us? Yes. I don't intend to go out. "True love. Is it really necessary? "Tact and common sense tell us to pass over it in silence "Like a scandal in Life's higher circles. "Perfectly good children are born without its help "It couldn't populate the planet in a million years, "It comes along so rarely. "Let the people who never find true love "Keep saying that there's no such thing. "Their faith will make it easier for them to live... "and to die." Anton! Happy birthday! How did you know? I know everything. Hi, Anton. How are you? - Hi. Happy birthday. - Where's Mary? She couldn't come. But she sends her love. I still can't get used to your beauty Tell me... What's it like to be so beautiful? What does it feel like? Why are you so happy? Look at this guy. Instead of being glad to see his only friend happy, he's grumpy I'm not grumpy. I'm just surprised. Come sit down Thank you. I forgot to get your pipe back from Noam That's all right. What's wrong? I thought it might help you quit smoking. What do you think? I hesitated between this Stanwell and a black Savinelli. You chose well. Thanks. You don't look so pleased Don't you want to quit smoking? I do I do. And this is from me. Thank you. Charming. You look much younger. Don't you think, Anton? No, no. Put it on It's really great My suspect didn't have a motive and he had an alibi. The second suspect had a motive and a flimsy alibi but I still insisted it was the first guy. Why? Sometimes intuition prevails over the facts Fascinating Isn't it, Ilan? But tell me, are there borderline cases? Cases which aren't investigated because of lack of information? What do you mean? Well, like oil in the ground. Even if you never find it, it still exists, doesn't it? Surely there are many crimes which are never investigated. You mean sex crimes? That, too. But... Let's say someone gets murdered and no one knows. No corpse, no crime - That's terrible, isn't it? I recently got a letter from a woman saying that someone she knew disappeared from Bat Galim and she suspects something happened to him. Interesting. What do you do in such cases? Usually we wait for cross-information In most disappearance cases, the person simply ran away from women, debts, the mafia Usually from women. What is cross-information? That's if someone else... notifies us of his disappearance. Excuse me Hello? Ilan, what are you doing here? Come Have a seat Sit down Why are you standing like a tree? Are you busy? - I'll go now. You got a nice tan at the country house. How are you doing? Under pressure Do you want to eat? No, I was just passing by What will you have, sir? Just a beer What, Ilan? Nothing. I was just passing by and I thought. What? What's wrong with you, lately? Nothing. Don't give me that. I know you inside out. There's nothing wrong with me. Problems in the department. Nothing interesting. Who can you talk to if not to me? Is it about Naomi? No, why? I'm just asking Where did that come from? I'm just trying to get you to open up Don't. Everything is all right Please. - Thank you. Just a minute I'm going to the bathroom. You're not going to believe this. Shimi Leder's dead. Who? - Shimi Leder. Look Don't you remember that overgrown lazy bum? Maybe we should go to his funeral? You're joking. No, I'm not. Why would we go to his funeral? It's the least we can do for him. We weren't at Hansey's funeral, either. What's that got to do with it? Nothing... We weren't at her funeral. Yes. Did you convince Anton to go to Shimi Leder's funeral? Something like that. I couldn't believe it when Anton's mother told me. Why do you have to go back there? Mom, not now. Come pick me up at two thirty What did she want? Tomorrow, they' re burying someone from the neighborhood. Shimi Leder. And? She wants me to go with her. What's with her and all those funerals? She's still mad because I wasn't at Hansey Bauer's funeral. I still don't understand why you had to go there in the first place Hello, Mrs. Bauer I'm Kathy's son. Ilan. I know who you are. I'm sorry I didn't make it to your sister's funeral. You're a busy man You're on television. Well, I'll go visit her. We'll come with you - No! I have to go to the doctor - Are you coming? "Hansey Bauer" Aren't you putting up a tombstone? Only after the first year. That's our custom Do you want me to say the prayer for her? That's nice of you "Exalted and sanctified is God's great name... "In the world which He has created according to His will... "May his anointed be near. "In your lifetime and your days, and in the lifetime of all Israel "Speedily and soon and say Amen" - Amen. "May His great name be blessed "Forever and to all eternity Blessed and praised, glorified and exalted "Extolled and honored, elevated and lauded, "be the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He. "Far beyond all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations "That are spoken in the world and say Amen." -Amen "May He who makes peace in His high places "Grant, in His mercy, peace for us and all of Israel and say Amen" Amen. Thank you. You said it with conviction. What were you looking for? It's strange. What is? It looks like someone tampered with this grave. You see... Those two graves were dug after Hansey's But even though they were dug later on, the grass there is higher! Here the grass is thin and short That means someone turned the dirt here a week or two after the burial. Probably some animal I don't think so. Someone turned the dirt What did you say? Nothing. Everything's fine Who turned the dirt? No, no one It's all right. How could you do something so stupid? And stop driving so fast Do you want to kill me, too? It's hopeless Nothing is hopeless Anton isn't going to run and dig up a grave so quickly. He won't go looking for something he didn't lose. But then again, maybe we should dig him out and move him somewhere else. We might have to cut him into pieces so that we can... Stop it I'm thinking out loud. At least have the politeness to listen. I'm not the one who got us in this mess. Thanks for all you've done for me. I apologize if it seems like I took it for granted. You're not giving up, Ilan. Something will always pop up. "Pop up!" How dare you? Take care of Naomi. She doesn't have anyone else. There will be a lot of suitors Why are you looking at me? The second you're locked away in jail, there will be someone by her side ready to comfort her Flowers like her don't remain without water. Anton Karam. Please leave a message Hi, Anton... I have to talk to you. But not on the phone. Let me know when you're in the office. I went to take out the trash. It started to stink. I'm going to lie down. I think I'm coming down with the flu Why are you looking through the trash? I lost something. What did you lose? We could help you look. No need. Thanks You can go Hey, do you know how to read? - He can read! Can you read what's written here? Read what's written next to the two lines. The letters. Read the letters. PO-Sl-TIVE Positive. - Positive! Thank you. Why didn't you tell me? About what? About the pregnancy You looked through the trash? Why didn't you tell me? Because I wanted to think first. About what? Things. Don't you want the baby? There are things we need to talk about. There's nothing we can't overcome. It depends. Do you want the baby, Naomi? Yes. So we'll have the baby Hello? I'm in the office. You can come over now. No, no. It's all right. Are you sure? You sounded odd I wanted to tell you over drinks, but. To make it short, Naomi's pregnant What? - Yes. Congratulations. - Thank you. Really? Good for you! - Thanks. Regards to Naomi and a kiss from me Don't forget. - Okay You surprised me. - Okay We'll talk when we meet Okay -Bye. - Bye. I'm going to be a grandmother. I must have done something good in a previous life. They say that there's nothing like being a grandmother. Well, we'll see about that. Do you remember the song I used to sing when you were a baby? You don't have to. Why? I want to hear What does it mean? You don't want to know. It looks like a cashew. What's wrong? Tell me the truth! - What? Isn't this dish too simple? Simple? I love it. Yes, but it's too plain Ketchup. Are they kids? The deacon and the head of the department! Davis and Givon? They're all excited by your invitation. Roast the sunflower seeds, please. But on a very low fire. No, without oil. Here I'II show you Like this You flip it, okay? Excellent. Okay. In half a minute take them off. And please dry the lettuce with the towel. I'll cut it at the last minute. I'm going to get ready. Open the wine please. Okay "Man's Body Found in Old Woman's Grave in Haifa" Naomi! Where's the corkscrew? Naomi? Naomi? Naomi. I'll tell them to go. No, let them in. I'll check on the chicken. This salad is excellent. I can't stop eating it. Such a special taste! It's the olive oil It's excellent. I only discovered olive oil this year. Before that, I ate butter, like an idiot. For years, I've been telling him that he has cholesterol! What an idiot. What can I say? But ever since I discovered olive oil. It's a new life. When you buy olive oil, you have to check the label. At most 1.5?% acidity. In Greece, we found a bottle with 0.8%, but that's rare Enough about olive oil, Givon. Move on. Find something else. He's right Enough with your olive oil. Hello? Yes. We're here Bye. That was Anton. He's on his way here. I don't know how to say this... We grew up together. 60 years This isn't easy. Go ahead and get it over with. Your mother died, Ilan. She took pills What? My mother found her today at eight in the morning. I guess she took the pills last night. The pathology report still hasn't come in. She left a letter. It's addressed to me but I think she wanted you to read it too. "Dear Anton, "I'm writing this letter to you, "because on the practical level, it involves you. "As you know, "I never managed to be a true mother to Ilan. "No need to go into detail Those who know, know. "I also won't describe an old mother's feelings of guilt. "I believe that a person has to suffer "without disturbing the neighbors. "I can only say that I couldn't see Ilan "tormented by jealousy like his father in his time. "For the first time, I managed to truly identify with my son. "Imagine that. So I decided to be of use to him. "In March, I hired a foreign worker who does odd jobs "and he killed Oded Safra. "No use looking for him. "He left the country with 20,000 Dollars in cash "That was my way of redeeming myself. "You can't fight your nature, I guess. "The problem began when Ilan became suspicious. "I didn't have a choice. I had to tell him "I don't have to tell you how he reacted "On the other hand, it's hard to ask a son to turn in his mother. "Not even you would do that. "So I'm relying on you to close the case "and let Ilan and Naomi rebuild their life. "If you're not sure, consult with your mother. "Yours, Kathy Ben-Natan."
