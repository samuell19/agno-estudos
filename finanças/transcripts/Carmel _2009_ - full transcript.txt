This is a poem about people what they think and what they want and what they think they want even though few things on earth really deserve our interest. It's a poem about what men do because what they do is more important than what they haven't done. It's a poem about people everywhere about the way they feel on a blue night singing the song of the caravans and the way they can taste sand in the scorched airplane that crashes whistling like a lament of mourning. And lastly, these are poems about war written at a desk while it is raging without mercy. While the sanctuary was burning, looting went on and on and all who were caught were put to the sword There was no pity forage, no regard for rank. Little children and old men, layman and priests alike were butchered. Every class was held in the iron grip of war whether they defended themselves or cried for mercy. Through the roars of flames, as they swept relentlessly onwards, could be heard the groaning of the fallen. Such were the heights of the hill, and the size of the flaming temple. The entire city seemed to be on fire. Titus entered Jerusalem. He was stunned by the strength of its towers. He said: God has been on our side. It is God who brought the Jews down from these strongholds. What could the hands of men or any machines do towards overthrowing these towers? When he destroyed the rest of the city and pulled down the walls, he left the towers to bear witness. The time is now come that obliges us to make our resolution true in practice and not bring on ourselves dishonor. We despise slavery even without risks. So let us not accept captivity with intolerable punishment, knowing that it would be our share if we were to be captured alive. We were the first that revolted and the last to fight against them. God hath granted us the power to die bravely and free. Our hopes were in vain for He brought defeat upon us. It now becomes known that tomorrow our distress will come. Let us make haste to die now, we and our beloved together. It will be a grief to the Romans not to seize us alive. We wish death would come before we saw the Sacred City destroyed. While as for the noise, nothing could be imagined more temble or horrifying. There was the war cry of the Roman legions, the yells of the rebels circled with fire and swords. The people who were left above were beaten back upon the enemy who shrieked as the end approached. The crips on the hill were answered from the crowd in the city. The soldiers grew weary of bloodshed. Orders were given to kill anyone who was armed and opposed them Everyone else was to be captured. The old and the. weak were killed. Men in their prime were herded into the Temple. Those who were taken for suspicion or terrorism and had turned against each other were executed. The tallest and handsomest were kept for the triumph. For the rest, those over 17. Were sent to hard labor in Egypt. Most were sent to perish in the arenas by assault of wild beasts. Those under 17, we sold. 11,000 of the prisoners died of starvation. All the prisoners taken from the beginning to the end of the war totaled 97,000. Those who perished in the long siege, totaled 100,000. I get a phone call. They say: Eidel, you must perform with us. I say: What? Don't do that kind of thing. I got out 6 months ago. They say: It's a special gig. They're taking the army's best singers from recent years... to do a show in L.A.

In my school there’s a young teacher. Nice, and we like the lessons with him because he can joke too. Isn't rt nice? He teaches us grammar. A British accent, it's hard for me. And we're reading an Oscar Wilde play. We read it loud. He also told us about London. The world’s theater capital. I saw aninteresting play about Galileo. I’ll tell you about it when we meet. You must've heard his name. He lived 330 years ago in Italy. He was a great scientist. Mathematician, astronomer, star researcher. And he’s the one who said that the earth revolves around the sun and not the way the others thought back then: that the earth stands still and that all the host of heaven circles our little planet. Galileo was a brave and wise man. The rulers of his time, the clergy. Persecuted him for his opinions. They jailed him, thinking they could withhold truth and science. But they failed. The truth broke through the walls and people saw that he was right. Since you've. decided to live Since you’ve decided to stay... Since you've decided to stay in Kfar Masaryk, I've decided to extend my stay in London. Dad wrote to, me ancTs'uggests I stay longer. I.thinkjlillfcontinue my studies to. make'Ithe most of my time here. There’s so much to learn in life. You too. study while in the kibbutz. Work is important. But so are studies. As for your visits to Grandma. I don't want you on the roads every Saturday. Don’t njniarounchetfery Saturday on the roads to Kiryat Bialik Once of fortnight is enough. Restrain yourself. I also would Iove to... to see you. but I restrain myself and I don’t hop over to you. So you can restrain yourself.too. Once a fortnight to, Kiryat Bialik and once a fortnight to Dad's in Kfar Masaryk. You’ll see dad more often. On Succoth go to Yigal, OK Since you’ve decided to stay in Kfar Masaryk, I’ve decided to extend my stay in London... How are you? OK, and you? I’m OK. Working hard? Not too hard. - Taking care of yourself? - Yes. - Give my regards -OK. You'll pay for what you’re doing Shame on you. Go away Scram ' Get out of here ' Hands off’ They're cutting down our trees. It’s our land, go away. What are you doing Those are our trees. Erez, don't stop. Get him out of there Go away, don't pass through here. Give me that, give it to me Give me that Move away. There. Let's chop down those trees. We’ll chop off their arms and legs too. Bring the saw ’ Move away. Get out. What's going on What's come over you people It’s our land ’ Our trees What do you want The war the Jews made with the Romans was the greatest of all those that have been seen in our times and maybe also of those that ever were heard of, worse than those waged between cities or between nations. Some historians of this war, who were not involved themselves have collected contradictory stories by hearsay and have written them down in a sophisticated style. Others that were present, either out of flattery to the Romans or of hatred towards the Jews. Give false account of things. Their writings sometimes contain accusations, and sometimes encomiums but nowhere the accurate truth of facts. I. Joseph, the son of Matthias, by birth a Hebrew, bom in Jerusalem, a priest also, and one who at first fought against the Romans myself, and was forced to be present at what was done afterwards. I shall tell all subjects of the Roman Empire what happened dunng this war. I shall translate into Greek the book I formerly wrote in Hebrew. The hill on which the temple stood seemed to be boiling hot, as full of fire on every part of it, and the blood was larger in quantity than the fire and those slain were more in number than those that slew them, for the ground was not visible between the dead bodies and the soldiers, as they ran after those who fled from them, went over heaps of bodies. The rebels sought to push back the Romans in order to make their way to the outward court of the holy house, and from thence into the city. The remainder of the populace sought refuge above the cloister of that outer court. Some of the priests plucked up leaden spikes from the sanctuary and used them as darts against the Romans, butin vain What are you looking at You're successful injustice doers. Thieves and adulterers. You’ll end up competing against each other, robbing and murdering.. What strange ways you have. God left your Temple due to them. You thought the walls would protect you but they didn't. The bodies were even dismembered. A hand here, another there. It was utter chaos. When the first line fell. The ones behind climbed over it until they could fight no more. Shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow. Until the Romans cut them down. Poor Jerusalem A voice from the. East A voice from the Wes t A voice from the four winds A voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, A voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, And a voice against this whole people. Poor Jerusalem! Roberto. Come'.here. You’ll stand here and describe to us... what happened. You point to this area and you say: "I’m the pilot”. - I'm the pilot. I crash landed. I crash land... Crash. Wart, don't be edgy. Please, say it again. There was a crash-land... Crash. - Crash... - Ilan, try it again. - Should I try? - Yes." - You see. Amit - Ben.' - You see, Ben? - Yes, We crash landed right behind that tree. I think we’ll do this... What do you say. Ilan? Let's do this... like I'm talking to you guys, the crew. Wasn't it good I think it's better that way. - Haim - Yes. Spoke to Rivka this morning. It's Haim, not Haimke. right Yes. I spoke to Rivka this morning... I love the way you laugh. Spoke to Rivka this moming. I said: We’re in a place that really resembles Kibbutz Snir in the Golan Heights, full of cows. Sunshine... She’s in Paris, it’s cold there. Now we’re... close to when it happened. She said she loves the smell off cows So you play my son. Where we're walking’is very similar to where my helicopter crashed. It was during the Yom Kippur War. It was a day like.today. The sky was’blue. See the. sky? Not one cloud. We flew over Syna to try and rescue a pilot who had abandoned his. jet His name was Schneider. And after we got there, we flew... After a few days of taking out people who were burnt in tanks. We finally go to our spot and the Syrians hit us with a missile We sat inside the helicopter. I’ll show you what it was like. It was"something like... If this is the helicopter. If, let’s say.'it’s flying towards me, then I was sitting here. Sorry. Avner Hacohen sat here. I sat behind him. Next to him sat co pilot, Gadi Klein. Uzi Cantoni sat here. - You know Uzi? - Yes, he's your neighbor. That's nght. Nadav Gottlieb’’sat in the back, he was the mechanic. And Dr. Keenan sat here. The Syrians shot their rocket like so and it initially’hit Gadi Klein who was killed, on the spot the whole cockpit split open. Avner and I. who sat farther away, only got hit by shrapnel. Uzi. who sat here. Got shrapnel in his skull. Keenan died later ♦ and Nadav fell out with his helmet, hit the helicopter engine, his helmet cracked and he was injured. So what do you say about that Er... You’re lucky to have made it. Yes, I am lucky. You know what date that was - October 11th You know what that is - Yes, it’s your birthday, Dad. That's right, my birthday. Truth is, you’re saying it as if you mean it. It’s not always like that with actors. Sometimes they fake it when they say something. H’s here, see? Now there's a cowshed, and this is what happens. There’s a devastating event. Then the kibbutz decides that this is the ideal place for cows to eat their straw. And now there's no trace of what happened. That's the way it shoulcbprpbably-be. Because the world keeps on turning. But Gadi never came back. Kfar Masaryk Cemetery The body of Rajiv Gandhi will be burnt at the site where they burnt the body of his mother Indira a few years ago. - She was also assassinated. - Awful. Many heads of state have announced they'd attend Gandhi's funeral. VP Dan Quayle will attend on behalf of America. August 28th, 1988 Helsinki on Raya and Gideon's island. My darlings, my children, Indeed I've aged yet again. Another year has been added to my round and growing age and Raya and Gideon threw me a birthday party. Last night we called Amos and Rivka in Paris, and my adorable, mischievous grandchildren said in unison ’’Happy birthday and many more.” I said: "God forbid. Just hope the computer stays OK.” I’m sitting here on a wooden bench on this ever captivating island. By the seashore, it’s lovely and peaceful. The sun is now hiding behind a black dog-shaped cloud. And behind his head and muzzle there’s a silver lining of sunshine. Here, by the bench, stand proud trees that never fall. Either poplar or birch trees. By the water grows a young pine tree. How did you get here, so close to the stormy shore in winter Fearless and strong like these Finns. They amaze me. And I enjoy the messages they convey. Such silence. No chatter or talking, only the occasional footstep. A few couples walk. Some run, some families nde bicycles. Many couples. A little girl with golden curls. Riding a bicycle alone, passes by. Probably on her way home. The sun comes out again, bicycles too. And a single person strolls along. The sun is setting and is hiding behind the last cloud and the beautiful golden trail of the sun rays breaking on the water is thinning. Final flutters before sunset. Yes. it is 21 03. Nothing other than that happened. Nobody follows you. You sit and write from right to left. The freedom to be alone. How lovely. Now a tall couple walks towards me. The man is pushing a stroller and a big dog walking beside them approaches my bench. Sticks his tongue out. Doesn't touch or threaten me. The sun hasn't set yet. Ft just emerged, big and golden from behind the dog-shaped cloud. It comes close to the water and scatters some dancing rays of light on the water. Yes The entire bay area is green. Many trees, in our way of thinking. Surrounded by forest. It's darkening now, and the waters are quiet. They’re grayish-white. And green at the brims. Light clouds are reflected. How lovely. Divine serenity. The sun has set. That's it. A happy birthday. Already 10 days like this. Man accumulates memories Like ants In summer time... Yes. One second. It’s taped down, sorry. Sorry to intrude, we were caught... - 1 understand. - The siren... Come in. Feel free to put some covers on. You can sit here. - I'm Efratia. • Pleasure. I'm Amitai. Let’s put on our gas masks'first. And what's your name - Yifat - Efrat? Yifat. What a predicament - Who'd imagine it would come to this. - What? Who’d believe we’ve come to this. Iraq’s strategic tactic of conquering Kuwait... I'm sure they didn’t expect the US... - I’m studying political science -1 see. Sorry for not offering beverages. Everything is OK now. What do you do? Armageddon in the world. - Pardon? - The war of Gog and Magog and the soul is troubled If only Gog will not prevail and Magog neither The house of Israel is in between And Jerusalem in the middle Let them not see us in tears Not hear our cries of pain Those of desperate people On their knees. And even if the enemy kills many of us We will not give in We will not convert Since we have conquered firp and water We feel happy, free and masters of our own fate The fire has reached ijs to catch us in distress And now it is the turn of water I think we can take it off. The soldiers continue their march But go nowhere Almost at the same point Something awful awaits. I alone know Since the look in your eyes Your gaze has kindled millions of sparks I didn't know if I was going towards you or away from you In the. streets of love. Leah Goldberg. Come to me. Don 't let me do anything. Do everything in my place. Do everything in my stead. Everything I begin will be completed by you. Yona Wollach. A man can be in two places, in the past and in the present. A man can be in two places. In someone else and in himself. - Yona Wollach - Nice. Someone passes in my life. And leaves his footprints on mine, leaves marks on my life. - Someone. - Let’s go. That's it? You're leaving I had a friend named Shulamrt. She said: "Age is no Joy." Age is no joy. Something to think about. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Take care. - Thank you. - You too. - Thanks. Bye. If we’re ever around, we'll... - Drop by. - Thanks. We went out to the street. The sky was dark. Thunder of airplanes. Windows were all taped up. Gidi said to me: "There’s a war.” What did I want to say I could've felt worse / couldn't do a thing about it. Do you hear Dear mother, hello. How are you and... Wait How are you Did you get my letter with the flowers Hope they didn't arrive all wilted. Thank you for the lovely calendar. I’m wearing the brown and white jumper. Soft and comfortable. It suits me. Thank you for the letters. I'll tell you about my day as I always do. It’s morning, the birds are chirping and hopping joyfully from tree to tree1. We rise, make our beds. Breakfast is served quickly. My tutor and I make a spitfire. Then the food arrives and we eat‘ Then we study. The teacher says good morning and we reply. We sit and if he’s in a good mood. He says a few words. Then he says: ”We'll study a subject for an hour and a half, then mathematics but no English.” And we complain because we like to study English. That's how class begins. If we do have English, we sing "good morning to you” in English and then have regular classes. When class isfover we go to eat some food. Then we go to work. I work on the farm. From work we go to the showers. We rest for an hour and go to our rooms. Lights out afcnine. We hear the chickens clucking. And then everything goes quiet. Everyone sleeps in his warm bed. Everyone falls asleep. After half a day-of work the weekday is over. Love, Amos. We have Omer. Who's missing Amos, how are you? Sit down. son. Let's go over whahwe've learned. Here we have the Greek temple. Very nice. Greek... OK. Greek Temple. What do you call the thing that holds... Beam is correct When something's from Greece, it’ Greek. A Greek Temple. That's an excellent question. What are these called Columns, right. Beams go like this... The market is empty and dark. Shops are still closed. Only vendors of suhun and suhun bagels with sesame and hyssop advertise their wares to early risers. Other than them, the market is still. A boy gets to the station at the last minute. He's relieved to see that the train hasn’t pulled out yet. It's 6:15 am. The train cars are filled with Arab workers from Acre making their daily tnp to Haifa. Some work for the railroad. Others go to governmental or construction jobs. They look out the car windows and ask: "Where's the boy with the violin The conductor calms them: "Easy, easy, he’ll show up." They all wait for this boy. Then the boy comes running with all his strength. Huffing and rushing to get on board. The passengers let out sigh of relief and cheer him. The Arab conductor helps him up and adopts a smug expression: he fulfilled his promise. He blows his whistle anfd the engine blasts in response. The boy is on board. The passengers make room for him to sit and the train moves. You can sense how pleased they are. That’s the story of Joshua Luria. Efratia is also a Luna descendant That's the story. Saturday night, March 31st, 1984. Keren, my sunshine. I got you ’100 First Songs'. A book recommended by your mom. In a few days you’ll be one year old. How lovely, your first year. You can stand on your little feet. You've picked your head up and discovered a new world, nght I hope you'll always stand erect. With your head high, eyes open to see a lot of the beautiful world around you. Flowers, trees, birds, lakes, brooks. The ocean and waves. So many colors. All the colors and shades. Sounds and noises. Whispers, quiet, silence, and smell the flowers, grass, hay and taste many flavors. Sweet honey, hot pepper. And all of the many spices given to us by tbe Almighty - nature. Wrote you only about a tiny fraction of all the wonders he's created, humans and animals, small, tiny, and big, huge, Adam and Eve. In my long life I’ve seen quite a few. There were good and bad ones. Some weren't too good. Always amazed at how each one differed from the other. At how nature was created by the one that some call "God". It’s a mystery. Maybe you’ll be able to solve it In any case, you who were so loved by your good mother and father. By your grandpa and two grandmas, by aunts, uncles and friends of family, you’ll know how to love the other people. The boys and girts. And they'll love you too. dear Keren. There'll be those you don't like. That's OK too. As long as you love life, my darling. Yes, you have everything going for you. Bless you, and many happy returns. And I'm sending warm regards to your dear parents. Kisses. Granny Efratia. Keren, I’m sorry, but the drawings aren't good. Soon you'll draw better ones. He doesn't get Bialik poems or Leah Goldberg songs: beautiful, quiet songs. That’s how it is. - Can I - Yes. July 20th, 1986. Dearest Keren, here’s a little bag with many blessings. We can't see them but I v/hispered them in there. Keren, be healthy, wise and pretty when you’re grown up too, OK Take care of your brother too, OK Help your parents whom you love very much. You know how to help. Learn something you already know: to put things back in their place. You're done with a toy Put rt away immediately. Finished reading a book Right away. And so forth. It's good. Then sing and dance. Good, good, the way you do it. Kisses, Granny Efratia. I thought it was the one with the dolls. You want the one with the dolls November 4th, 1983. Sweet, sweet Keren, You must've grown prettier since I saw you, but I'm sure you laugh. Laugh with joy. and that's great You must've forgotten me. But I remember you and miss you. In our Haifa, where we were bom. You, your parents and me, there’s a heat wave going on. I went into town today to look for a nice outfit for you and found this pale blue one. Like it? It was chaos, one day I’ll tell you and I came home with a headache. I bought you 3 little dolls: your parents can do you a show, a puppet-show. I'm sorry they're not so pretty, but that’s all there is here. Ask your father to fix their hair with paint. He can. Your mother can tell a nice story. Meanwhile, be healthy. And send my regards to the park, trees, pigeons and ducks. Yes, Keren, we stand for democracy. Not a monarchy. Kisses, Granny Efratia. Cute. November 18th. 1984. Amos, for your question about living somewhere else. I’ve thought it over, but where When I was young, after the kibbutz, I studied in Vienna and Berlin, 1932. We let our provincial ways go and ft was great. But now? No. Maybe London In 1960 it was great studying there for a year. I loved the rainy city and I loved being able to be alone. It was indeed rough. Toughening, interesting, and the students were like boys who didn't fear getting old. But to live there permanently? No. Both London and the British are not as they once were. Paris? It’s got some appeal. I’d gladly visit Centre Pompidou, by the carrousel, feast my eyes on the fountains and, of course, rush in on the escalator with fellow humans. Great. I’d visit the impressionists, too. I love, love, love them. I’m charmed each time, I’m mute in this city. French? No way... If so. no. There’s no other place to live in. No, neither I nor others like me, have another place. After all, some things make life easy even in the Israel of 1985. There’s a beautiful area in the Carmel, a beach, boardwalk at dusk. Bat Galim and Dado beaches. Beautiful sunsets. There’s the university. Nathan Zach. Enjoy it a lot. A bit of A.B Yehoshua Gideon Efrat, the best. There’s the Haifa theater. Jerusalem, music and friends, those who’re still alive. We know what true friendship is. The Second Immigration people... and my dear parents are buried here. I’ll always love them and never forget. Some of my best friends lie here too. So does my architect husband. And many more. I’m not a grave keeper, no. Dry, hollow bones, no. But memories were made here and they can't be uprooted. I take short visits to distant places and come back. We might not have another place but anxiety is setting in. What will become of you, the youngsters, our flesh and blood, dreamers of the lost dream? Can you overcome the darkness that envelopes us? Goodbye. Mama. The war bell rings at the doors People are surprised, this can't be And as usual. I ask questions I lock the door Shut off the lights Goodbye And destruction hits like waves on sand People search who's on the right, who's on the left. You need not meddle Just look from the side If I could. I'd be unique And I pray to God The One Redeemer My God Why? Stressed people pour into the streets Throwing rocks, overturning cars And I face them holding 2 torches One for myself the other for what’s ahead They lie anyway As usual Donfygivfya damn about truth Waiting for the future The present died long ago Your life is like a continuous string When God's had enough, he just smiles And cuts it And I pray to God The One Redeemer My God Why? Soldiers line up And wear their berets Thtfcommanders. are shamed And wipe their tears I close my eyes at such funerals So much sadness, it can't be How much morel? If I asked to escape Then I had a choice Arid if I riave'no mow strength Then I'm going back It's so important not to forget So I try to remember If I had a bit of brains I wouldn't be retarded I’m sorry And I pray to God The One Redeemer My God Why?
