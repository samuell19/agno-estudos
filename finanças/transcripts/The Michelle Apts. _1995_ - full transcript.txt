I only review large companies. Well, there's only one company around here worth a shit... Turnbull Chemicals. You hear about our little tragedy last week? No. Bank manager, 20-year man. Couldn't sleep, so he gets up and shoots his neighbor's dog. - Really? - Yeah. And the owner goes to take a look out. And he shoots him, too. He shot the owner? Dead. Then his wife comes to the window and she gets plugged. People saying she's the stupid one. [Laughs] Welcome to Walton. Hartwell. Hartwell...Hartwell... Nope, we gave your room up. Uh, you gave it up? Thanks, Marge. I don't think you understand. My room was confirmed. Well there's nothing I can do about it now because we're all full up. Look.I'm very tired, and I'm sure it's just some sort of mix up. So why not just give me any room for tonight and I'll straighten it up with the manager tomorrow. I am manager. Oh. So aloha, Bub! [Drunken chatter] - Hello?... - Hello, Operator. Yes. I'm new in town and I need you to connect me with a with a hotel. - Well just use the yellow pages. . Yes, I would. But there isn't any phonebook here. - Well where is it? Well, I don't know. Like someone just ripped it up. - Ripped it up? Well...again, if you could hook me up with uh...with uh... Will you excuse me a moment? Hey guys, if you just wait quietly and I'll be finished in one minute. [Rowdy laughter] Hey, Alex! Need hand with those bags? Say, how did you know my name? Say, how did you know my name? Read it on your luggage tag. Aha. Aha. All the regular hotels be booked up on account of the the convention. But I think it just might know a place. Well, come morning, you go up two blocks, cross one, talk to Mrs. Haggerty. Tell her Ernie sent you. Buenos Noches Amigo! I beg your pardon? That's Mexican for, "Hey there, stranger!" Oh. Coffee? Thanks. You look like a sad old dog with no bone to gnaw. It's been a long day. What is that on your shirt? Oh, my God. Must have been from that palm tree. There's a john downstairs. Do you mind watching my bags for me? Sure. Oh, and flush hard, 'cause it's a long way to the government. [Laughs] What's the matter? Uh,my hotel gave up my room and this this cab driver, Ernie He said that you might have a have a place. Well then I guess we're going to have to show Mr. Hartwell his room. I wouldn't have a thing if it weren't for Mrs. Henderson dying last night. Dead as a bucket, just like that. And here's the kitchen. You mean the last person that lived here just died? Oh, does that bother you? Oh, well, I mean, she wasn't shot by her bank manager, was she? Oh, heaven's no! Brain hemorrhage. Oh, Oh my. That's right where it happened. What? They say that just before she died, she vomited. Oh. I tried shampooing, but it just keeps coming back. Uh huh. Your keys Good Morning. I'm the auditor, I think you were expecting me. We have been expecting you. Alex Hartwell. Sorry I'm late. I'm Mr. Abernathy. This is your desk. Ok. I'll pull some files to get you started. Great. You want one? No, I'm fine. Where are you staying? Michelle apartments. Haggerty's, place?. Yes. Why? There's something funny about those two. Funny? Funny. Like they're related. Well, they are married, aren't they? Oh, no. I mean, they're related. You know? Well, they do have baby. Did you see the baby? I'm sorry. I didn't see anyone. Excuse me. Nice lamp. To bad it's broken. I guess you'll have to fix it. I guess I will You know, a little porcelain cement will fix that up in no time. I'll remember that. Listen, honey, I've got a stain on my shirt and I need to know how to get it out. Well, I'm not sure what it is, it seems to be something sticky. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know, I mean, I wish I could be there to help you out. Listen, honey, I didn't get too much sleep last night, so I'm really tired, OK? Uhhuh. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Oh, yes, Mr. Hartwell. I'm sorry, did I wake the baby? Oh, you know, babies. Anything little thing just sets them right off Well, I hope it's OK. It just have to get used to the new surroundings. [Baby Cries] - What is it, Jellyroll? Mr. Hartwell at the door again, Jules. What can we help you with? Well, there seems to be a problem with the plumbing. [Offscreen thump. Baby stops crying]. The plumbing? Yes, it's making a lot of noise. I had some trouble sleeping last night. Oh, well, Jules will look at that today, won't you, Jules? Sure. These things do have a habit of getting worse, don't they? Yes, they do. Thank you. - Mr. Abernathy. - Yes. It seems to be a bit of a discrepancy. Discrepancy? There's three hundred and fifty thousand in the environmental contingency and only thirty one dollars in the interest. Sounds like a possible journal entry error. I'll need a copy of the bank statements, just to be sure. The bank statements aren't kept here. I'll have to phone up for them. That'll be fine. It's Abernathy. Mr. Hartwell is asking questions about the environmental contingency fund. He wants to see a bank statement. Copy machine is down right now. They'll have them brought over here by tomorrow. [Phone rings]. Yes. Mr. Mr. Hartwell. That was Mr Turnbull. He'd like to see you in his office. As soon as possible. Human excrement. That's what the son of a bitch threw on at this time. One day I'll catch the little fucker. And pinch his head off...like a bug. Probably just some kid. So how do you like our little hamlet? Well, I've never been any place quite like it. This is the peak season. Name your poison. Nothing. Thanks. My father said never trust a man who doesn't drink. It's a bit early for me. My father was also an asshole. So where are you staying? The Michelle Apartments. Must be hard. Being in a strange town, not knowing anybody. You a family man, Alex? I'm engaged. Left the little woman at home, eh? I know some people that would see that as an opportunity. Mr Turnbull, is there something specific you wanted to discuss with me? What is it? Looks like a turkey. You're right. Can you believe it? And there isn't a stitch of turkey meat in the whole damn thing. [Laughs] Wie geht es! Guten Abend! That's German for, "How's it hanging?" Ahah. I got some news for you. - Dumplings. - Dumplings? und Wienerschnitzel! Oh, I Don't know, I'm not very big on exotic food. That's not exotic. It's German. Mama made it!. Mm hmm. That's the spirit. Thanks. You planning to eat here? Oh, Hi. Yes. I just ordered. I think. Bert's been giving you the B.S. about his mama? There you go. Wow! How about you, good looking? Just two packs of the usual Bert. I keep telling her to eat more and smoke less. Those things will kill you! Not any faster than my mama's schnitzel. Shh! Don't let mama hear you say that You survived! Survived? Bert's cooking. I hope so. Did you get your lamp fixed? Why? I meant to ask you earlier. Maybe you want to give me a hand with it? Sure. If you'd like. Are you good with your hands? Yes, actually. And lamps are my specialty. Really? Thanks. It's always so hot in here. It's probably the heat. From the, uh, dryer. Where's Flo? - Flo... Flo , it's me! Excuse me. There's nobody in there. What are you doing here? Flo! Oh, do you mean Mrs. Henderson? It's me, Dirk! Listen. Dirk. I'm the new tenant here. Mrs. Henderson is dead. Dead? A few days ago, What happened? Me and Flo, we had a date! Well, I guess she won't be going on any more dates. That isn't funny, pal! You make fun of the dead and the dead will be making fun of you. Oh! Oh no no no. Living the bachelor life, huh? You want to get yourself a little lady to do that for you. That's a good idea. [Machine stops] Washing's done. Right! [Ahem] So then I guess I should be getting back. Mr. Harwell, what a surprise. [Baby Cries] I hope I'm not disturbing you, but it's about the noise. Yes. Now there's a stain on the ceiling. Oh, my. What's up, Jellyroll? Mr. Hartwell says that there's a stain on the ceiling. I didn't see no stain when I was up there. Oh, well, Jules, maybe you should go to Mr. Hartwell's room and take a closer look. Sure. Anything else on your mind? Well, there is one thing. It seems that some of my laundry got mixed up with someone else's. Oh, don't say. Yes. When I was sorting my laundry, I discovered an extra sock. Oh, dear, you're certainly have your fair share of problems. I believe it belongs to a young woman, brunette, about so tall. Oh, dear. Excuse me. Listen, why don't you go get the sock and I'll take care of it. Well I'd really rather return it myself, if that's OK. [Off Screen] Jules, I think there's something wrong with the baby! Just a second, Jellyroll. Ok, I know you're busy, so why not just tell me what apartment she's in? Ok, pal. She's in 303. [Off screen] Jules!. Hi! What do you want? I think some of your laundry got mixed up with mine. I brought it to you. It's in the bag. Who's this, Maddie? Our new neighbor. He says some of his laundry got mixed up with ours. Is that right? We have some of your laundry? No, I do. You see, I was doing laundry with your wife and uh... ...we weren't doing it together. And she left and I did mine. And then there was something in the dryer that got mixed up with my load. Your load. Yes, it's Pretty common, really. People's laundry gets mixed up all the time. I didn't know that, did you know that Maddie? You see, Maddy does all our laundry. Is that what's in the bag? Yes. Thank you. That was a downright neighborly thing for you to do. It's nothing really. Maddy, have we got enough of that home cooked chili of yours for a good neighbor here? I can't stay. I have work to do. Maddie makes some kind of hot chili. Don't you, hon! Well he says he can't stay. Sure he can. No, really. I can't. Come on! There's lots of food. Oh, I couldn't. We feel insulted if you didn't join us. Sorry. It's OK. To good neighbors. So what aprtment you in? 203. 203...didn't some old lady live there? Yes, she died, actually. Is that right? Not too long ago. I wouldn't want to live in a place where the last person died. It doesn't really bother me. You must be a pretty brave guy. Mmm, this is great chili. Matty, you're not eating. I told you I'm not hungry. Open up. Choo choo choo choo... Wooo, woooo... Here comes the big train. Woo! woo! Coming into the tunnel...open up. Atta girl. Big train doesn't think you can get in there unless the tunnel gets a little wider.Woo, woo, woo! Choo-choo-choo-choo. Lick. There that wasn't so bad, was it? And she wonders why she's skin and bone. I have to go. I've got work to do. Hey. You haven't finished. What about dessert? I bet Maddie's cooked up a big surprise for us. She's full of surprises. Good morning, Mr. Hartwell. Good morning. Had the bank statements arrived yet? Sorry, Mr. Hartwell, the copier is still down. I was told I would have them on my desk this morning. I said perhaps they would be on your desk this morning. It's been two days! Well, I can't have that now, can I, Mr. Hartwell? I'd like to see them on my desk this afternoon Or would you rather be served with a court order. I don't see any need for that. You have them as soon as possible. See that I do. I'd like a bacon and tomato on whole wheat. Ah, so sorry, no can do. It's Chinese night. Couldn't you make an exception? Well, I wouldn't mind, but mama makes the rules. Your mama? Who's mama do you think? I don't know you...you tell me! How about some nice chow mein with sweet and sour pork? Yeah. All right, that'll be fine. Gong my fat chow, baby. Yeah! I got your seat right right here, darlin. You want some of my barbecue pork?. [Laughter] You never learn, do you? What? Bert's cooking is a slow death. Is that right? Are you inviting me for dinner again? I think you invited yourself. Hmm? You probably think I leave my panties around for other people to find. Oh,scavenger hunt. Lost lobster panties! Ok, OK. Keep your voice down. Ok. I'm sorry. Dean thinks there's something going on between us. Well, what are you doing here talking to me? I guess I like you. Yeah, but I mean, what if he sees us? There's always that chance. How did you ever get together with a guy like Dean? I got pregnant. Then he went to prison. What for? He killed some people. Staying for dinner, good looking? Just here for a smoke, Bert. [Rock Music starts] I love this song. Are you crazy: Sit down! People are watching. Want to dance? Oh, no thanks. I'm eating. Woiuld you please sit down? Oh, come on.

This baby sure motors. Three hundred fucking horses. Hey! Remember these? Uh, I don't...I don't know. Take a look. There's a stain on them. Got any idea what that might be? Well, if these were the ones that were mixed up with my laundry, then I think it's a vomit stain You're fucking kidding. I know. They fell on the carpet where Mrs. Henderson vomited just before she died. And know I accidentally stepped on them. Mrs. Haggerty said said she tried shampooing, but it just keeps coming back. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Slicing badly! Just got her out of the shop. Whole front end was smashed to hell. Really? Fuck! What happened? I hit a fucking station wagon. Anybody hurt?
