You see, this is my neighbourhood. Hey Susan! Hey Benjamin! This place is safe, you know, 'cause they all know that the Baron, he live here. And if anybody want some help, I can help them. Sometimes you get some silly people, they come but I can help them not be stupid and things like that. Hey, he's an imposter. This is my son, my boy Fritz. He want to be like his dad, but I'm all right, now Fritz. He's gonna be big when he grow up. He's definitely like his Ma. Hey, you're not a Catholic. I know, he don't know it. I'm Baron To'a, number one. Oh yeah. Number one, number two. It's number two! Yeah, I'm number two. Fritz is that. He's gonna listen, he's gonna be the champion. Shut up, Smiley. This fucker in the fence needs a hose. Controlling the pack, eh, boy? Who are these clowns? They look for church. More like overextended on me more. Hey, hey, hey, hey, where's your helmet?! No, see, there we go. There's a Kinlock Ave and a Kinlock Road. And let me guess, you put in the wrong one? No, no, don't brush my hand away, please? Let me do it. Here, simple, see? Welcome to our neighbourhood. They're jacking us up, they're jacking us up! Take the roof! They'll trade me to mine. Come on, take the roof. My god, where, what? We have no windshield. Okay. Really struggling to stand up all these days. I think you could turn the aircon off. Hey bro. - It rubs off. - No, no, all good. Hey, you working out your lifespace? What? Yeah, that's Lewin's model, eh? Yeah, dude, I have a degree in psychology. Yeah of course you do. Yeah bro, I mean I only do this Uber thing in my spare time for extra cash, you know, but my main hustle is I'm setting up a startup. Yeah bro, like we're trying to get... Ted. Fritz. - That's cool, bro. - I got a message you're in New Zealand. Yeah, I gotta sell this house or I won't get the seed capital. Mate, I thought it was settled last week. Yeah well so did I but it's a half share property and my uncle's gone silent. We need to be on the second wave of this market cycle. You need to be here and on focus as this thing gets ready to boom. Mate, I expect to be flying back tonight. I didn't even bring a change of clothes, okay? I gotta go, talk to you later. Check the docs I sent through. Hey you gotta turn up that street, mate. Yeah, I'm just gonna stop here. I don't go down that street. What? Yeah I hope you can give me five stars, hey, - that'll be sweet. - For goodness sake. Cheers, bro. Should have given them away then. Shush. You should have shushed. Maybe they'll start offering. Look at this daddy mongoose. What a hot fellow. You new around here bro? No. Hey bro. Welcome to the Sac. Cheers. Why you take my mower again? It's the community mower, Otto. I don't wanna have to tell Tahu why the lawns ain't mowed. Why you always take when I need it? It's 'cause every time you start it I get reminded of my bum boy chores. Come on, Hux. We'll just borrow when he's finished. That's just the way it is. Otto. Hey hey! Hey, hey, it's me. Fritz. Fritz! Who the fuck you are? Hey, keep it amicable. Oh, amica-fucking what? It means in a friendly way. I know the fuck what it means! Yo, who's this fella, eh? Gonna get his block knocked off. Hey, hey, go home. Hux, let's go. - Who the fuck? - Let's go. Otto, you gotta be more assertive with postulating youth like that. That macho crap is just a cry for attention the dad ain't giving them. And what's that a cry for? I think a hiding. Fritz! Some of your father's old clothes in a big bag. Pantheons of Slam. The biggest event on the pro wrestling calendar. The only man between To'a and the coveted title, 330 pounder known as The Law. Getting nostalgic, Uncle? Doing the research for your father's burial. He's been gone 20 years, Uncle. People still care? Hey, your father was a pioneer for the Polynesian people, and you forget that. Best not to get hung up on the past, focus on the future. No past, no here. No here, no future. That's where I've got broken thumb, broken fingers. I got a pin here, a broken shoulder. I got a pin in there. And I got a pin in my leg, Spleen. Spleen. And a broken spleen. But there's also the other, the wrestling injuries all over my body. Yeah, when I come to fight The Law, I'm going to be a bad boy because I'm going to break The Law. But not break the law but I'm gonna break that Law. That guy, I'm going to break him. Uncle, I thought you were looking forward to moving back to Tonga. But I called the agent. She said you hadn't signed. She never show up. She reckons you're avoiding her. You're a shit islander, man. I don't see you for all this time and you start with this? Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm just under the pump and I'm on the cusp of a once in a lifetime thing. This is your life too. Yeah, well, some things move on. Some things get passed on. Look. It's about change, Uncle, okay? Denial, resistance, exploration, commitment, okay? You're just in the resistance phase. I think you're in the denial phase. No, I'm here. Oh hoy! Look, I'm gonna text the agent to come around today with the papers before I fly out tonight. You do what you want. The journey of Baron Toa that will take him 8,000 miles north of his adopted country to Madison Square Garden. This is my show. It's no different to you and Dad's obsession with getting the title. - It's different. - Where in a single night, dreams come true or falter in the last hurdle. Chief Tonga Toa! Well can you tell his finisher when it comes to strength, agility, and athleticism. It's gonna come down to wits and cunning. - Tactics, not theatrics. - Shit. Speaking of tactics, a reversal from the Baron To'a! Small package. One, two, three! Yeah woo! I no hear noise like this before. Otto. I think Renee and Lacey need some help. Who and who? Otto, the cops have got it. I don't think so. It's not our business. She's my neighbour. I babysit for her. All right, all right, I'll go. Who's locked out? What's up? Hey officer, I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry, but we heard sounds of a domestic. It's in police control. Yeah I don't mean to be antagonistic but my gut says there might be a problem. Your gut's wrong. Take some probiotics. I've got this sorted. Your half buttoned shirt, belt undone. I don't think you do. You have problem with authority? Let's not forget who you represent. Yeah let's not forget, boy. Hey, want something like that, huh? Hey. Shouldn't have done that, boy! Wayne! What's wrong with you, man, calm down. What are you doing? I tried to warn him. Some kids need the stick. Now you're - being unreasonable. - Wayne. Wayne! Speak some more. Lucky skirt. See, I told you, boy. Got you now. Would have made a better postman. Otto Fernandez is gonna get take care for this! You must know you're out of your league. Stop it. Stop. Drop it. Stop making my mouth dry! Otto, get some water or something. See, that was just stupid now. I gotta wait till my eyes come right. Yeah that's enough, that's enough. Are you gonna calm down now? You'll get yours, mate! You'll get yours! Get what? You got nothing. Cheap shot. Cheap shot, bro! I see you haven't forgotten what I taught you, eh? What would possess you to get involved with a guy like that? Hey, calm down, Fritz. People have to understand that their bad life decisions affect others. Hey, no one asked you. You're something else. Wait, hey no, your white knight gesture was not needed. I had it under control. Yeah, well it didn't sound like it. I don't know what you think was going down but it's not what you think. Oh, kinkier stuff, was it? Hey, get your mind out of the gutter. It wasn't my mind, it was my ears. Bub, go inside. What you heard? That was a crooked cop who's been relentlessly pursuing me finding any excuse to cross my path. Who invited himself in for a cup of tea that he thinks I owe him for a ride that he pressured me into taking, and whose idea of seduction was to slip on a porno and chase me around my house. A likely story. Likely? Oh man, you need to get your head out your ass. Likely? You're welcome. Take your rugs back to the 50's, man. Look at my letter box! I'll set you up an email account. He's been in Australia too long. That's not the nephew I tell you about. Little punks. Man, can this place get any worse?! This place is going downhill. Little punks stole the mower, ruined my jacket. A psycho cop. Like it's a seller's market. The belt. Gone. What? After three months in Vava'u, Otto, you won't care about a thing. Is that all you have to say about it? Your father's belt is gone! Well I'm sorry. I'm just thinking about our priorities. Okay. Okay, me too. I no sell until the belt is back. That's fair, eh? Otto. No, no! How am I supposed to get the belt back? I don't know, big man! Follow the lawnmower, that's our life we're trying here! Carey. Carey, is that you? Hey. Hey. It's me, Fritz. Hey, is this the Gonzalez 2000? When was the last time you took it for a spin? Yeah, this neighbourhood ain't what it was. Hey Carey, I'm looking for these hoodrats who stole from Otto. You know where they hang? Seems obvious. There's one of the little punks now. Hey. What'd you do with my stuff? What? - Watch where you're going! - I'm sorry. Get a dog, yo. Come here! Hey! Oh shit! Oy! What the? Come here you bastard! Hey. What up? What you looking for, boy? Sit. No one. No, no. Come here! Oh shit! Hey! Oh shit! You like my heart shaped undies? Hey! Hey! Hey. Where's my stuff? Why are you asking me? The innocent don't run that fast. I was running from your asshole face, not guilt. What? For real, you think I'm running because you're gonna do something I ain't had done to me before? Enlighten me. Well I told you. That asshole face. That's it? Yeah, that's it. It's on you and everyone like yous. Whenever you're around people like me, whether you're a social worker, preacher, teacher, policeman, fireman. Zookeeper, beekeeper. Shopkeeper, whatever fucking noun suffix you want. You all got that same asshole face like you know me. What I'm thinking, what I'm about. What I'm gonna do. That same condescending concern feign self-righteous asshole face! That's quite the vocab spectrum. Bro! How's this for vocab? Where's my stuff! Bro, take it up with the big boys! I'm just watching a guy watching a fence! You need to work on your cardio if you're gonna live your life running. You fuck all! Yo! Hey open up, open up, open up, open up! Fuck you. Oh yo, hey where's Smiley? Lovely afternoon, bro? Shut up, Smiley! Punks have stolen my stuff. Yeah, yeah, it's a bit tato tato around here. What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours - but it's all good. - Yeah well that works best for those with nothing worth borrowing, doesn't it? Well you'll get used to how things are. I'm not trying to get used to it. I just want my stuff back. George is the name. Fritz. Saw you tussling with Robocop. Thought it was the great Baron To'a himself. The man, the legend! That's why I brought my fano to the sacred place. Yeah well. Guess he had his appeal to some types. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why don't I have a word to the pig hunters when they get back later on this afternoon? Try and get to the bottom of this misunderstanding. Well can't you just text them now? Bro, there are ways and then there are ways. We're waiting up the road. I know where you at. I don't like you. PR24 was decommissioned. I've got a soft spot for nostalgia. Red squad? Blue squad. Big Boss Man. Doing raids. That came from a dark hole. You are trouble. This street don't need your type. Don't understand why you're speaking monotone. Don't be doing it, boy. Look, I told you, I'm not trying to be antagonistic. Don't! Now what in your mind rationalises that to be appropriate police behaviour? You think you know it all but you're a fucking fool, boy. And you're possessed. Let's see if you got that same attitude when you need the police. Police? Now you're an LA gangster? You are a confused man. And where were you last night when we were being robbed? Oh yeah, that's right. Contributing to the domestic violence tally. You were robbed? Well maybe I can help you. Yeah you know what, I'm gonna make your robbery my lead investigation, get your stuff back. Don't be a dick. Please exit the police cordon. Haven't you had enough of the police? This guy's the special forces. Hey, Renee, look, things are gonna heat up pretty quickly around here. I need you to head back inside. I'll check on you later. No, don't do that. - I don't mind. - I don't want you to. It's my pleasure. Wayne, you're not coming over, ugh. Hey. I just wanna say sorry for coming out guns blazing last night. It was a tense moment heightened due to the physicality your lover brought to the situation. That is not my lover. And I told you that last night. I'm just trying to apologise. I blamed you without taking into account the corrupt environment. You might wanna get over yourself. Hey look, Renee. I have no choice. You must be Fritz. You said it was a done deal. Just give me more time. The offer's good, it won't sit on the table for long. And try to do something about the back lawn. Best just buying off photos. I got a reputation to uphold. Well do you want some taro? You are the? Go ahead, Lace. He's nothing special. Can you teach me some of your wrestling moves? No, you don't wanna wrestle. I already do. Uh huh. What is Wayne up to? Hey, that guy George reckons he'll talk to the gang for us. Oh, you meet George? Hey George, everything's under control. Go back inside. I don't see this many cops in a long time. Just keeping the peace, George. Just keeping the peace. Hey, Fritz. My lawnmower. I think that's my lawnmower. Oh that's just malicious. Knock, knock. Got your mower back. Did you get the belt? What belt? Nice use of taxpayer funds. Safer communities together. You know this makes this harder, right? I said no belt, no sign. Lacey, come and help me with the mower. You have six new voicemail messages. First new message. Mate, you read those docs? New message. Your thoughts? New message. The docs, mate. New message. Mate. New message. The docs, mate. New message. Hey Fritz, I don't actually know you but I'm Kate. Ted has requested that I call you and has asked me to ask you to either answer or call him back. Please, mate. Shit, this dog. What are these scratches? Lacey! Stop it, stop! Hey! Joining me for dinner? Oh shit! - Stay here. - I'm not scared of dogs! Why you bring a dog in the house? Why would I bring a dog in the house? I don't know, that's why I asked. I didn't bring a dog in the house. Well how'd it get here? I don't know. But this is how it's getting out. Okay, you're gonna fling open the door, I'm gonna stick out my arm and hopefully it'll lockjaw onto it and I can haul it out. No talk, do. Yeah on three, two, one, go. Piece of shit. Hey! Hey! Look, Tahu told us to tell you he's sweet with you borrowing the mower. It's not his mower. Where's the belt? Where's what?! I think you're confused, eh. Perhaps 'cause of your inexperienceing. Hello? Boys, boys. We're all cherry here. No hostilities required. Lotu just dropped off some seafood to Tahu. You boys better get over there and get some fresh pawa before the bloody mountain scoffs the lot. But he told us to come down here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's because I hadn't told them what really went down. Trust me fellas, this is all on Wayne. Nice to meet you, Fritz. Fish? Fritz. Nah, nah, it's Fish. Work out a bit there, cuz? Pushing what, six foot six in height there I reckon? Hey what exercise do you do to get your height? What, what you saying? Ha. You're one of those guys, eh? Why'd you put yourself on the line like that? It's just seafood, bro. Besides, who wants to live around hostilities? Hey I'm not the one responsible. Yeah I know. I saw what Wayne was doing. You must have really pissed him off big time last night. I told you that I would speak to Tahu. Like I said, I'll vouch for you. Respect for the legend Baron To'a. I'm not after respect. I'm after the belt. Yeah well I thought Wayne had brought your stuff back this morning. Tahu is willing to hear your side of the story. He's holding a community barbecue late this afternoon. Settle the cul-de-sac after this morning's madness. He asked me to extend the invitation. Said if you're cool, he's cool. Maybe get to the bottom of things. The vicious dog henchmen and now a barbecue invite? You overthink things. Free booze, boil up, and maybe even a Look, the invitation's there. Accept it before things get out of hand. If it was your father going, no problem. He know how to handle these type of people. But you. Well dad has his back in the days ways but this isn't back in the days. Human nature don't change. I don't think your talking gonna work. It's not talking. It's a meeting of minds. I just have to find the angle. Meeting of minds? these are no words that real people use man. He's gonna wanna make an example of me to maintain his ruthless rep. The proceeds from their criminal activities already provide for their basic drivers. They live in the realm of ego. This is the psychological zone that we need to cater our approach to. Look, Lacey. With a smart mind at work, it's amazing eh? He needs to assert his authority as publicly as the raid. Okay, so we learn what you know. My objective, Otto is to go there and shift his perspective around what happened. What you ask? No, I don't ask. A mutual disrespect for what the cops did to him and what they did to us. Transfer the negative psychological energy into a shared enemy, tension diffused. Okay. I don't think that will get the belt. Why not? Everyone know, you must fight for the title. Hey, Lacey. Do me a favour and don't tell anyone about the dog. I'm not asking you to keep a secret, just don't tell anyone. And I might teach you some wrestling. Yeah! I need to dialogue with them, initiate. Claim common ground in order to find the win-win. Well that's why I'm here. Do you still have any of those homemade skyrockets? Okay. What'd I tell you eh? Not once, not two times, three times. No driving where there may be people or cars. Why you not listen? You know the neighbours they complain. We're Renaissance men, dad. Innovators, thinkers, tinkerers. Go had tinkers. Innovators, I think you innovate and he follow. Carey, why you not listen, eh? I know you can't talk but your ears are still working. Get out of the car. You know the neighbourhood they think you not respect me, maybe they feel I don't discipline you, eh? This what gonna happen. You gonna discipline each other. This is stupid, dad. Oh oh oh. I think you both learned your lesson. What about Carey? Don't worry about Carey. He just follow you. You the one with the bad idea. I love you, son. Yes. Perfect. Yes. Yeah I remember. I was just a kid. Anyway, all I need you to do is spot me from up here. If you see anything get out of hand, any colourful commotion you think will escalate, just fire some of these into the compound to distract. All right. All right? Oh! Cuz! Good to see you here. How are you two feeling? Well, someone's gotta teach these urban browns the old tricks. They on, poppers too. Hey, won't you have a beer with me before I go? Oh you're not staying? No. Spend some quality time with the missus. She about? No, it's not her scene. See that? That's the community lovebird. One love. Eh? Never leave a man hanging on a toast to love. Any of these kids yours? Nah, mine are all grown up. Hey, have you met Tahu yet? No, why? Oh no, no you'll like him. He's like me. Huge fan of the Baron. Hey, relax, get some food. Get amongst them. You make it hard on those skinny, cuz. Why don't you try that shit on someone less skeletal, huh? Bro, don't have a heart attack. We're rooting for your cholesterol! Get off him! More weight! More weight! Let's go! Up up up! Come on daddy! Your spots! Your spots, your spots! Whoah, one take whoah, one shot whoah! One show, one show. What an egg. It's all good. Stay still, Smiley. Smiley huh? You got him running earlier. Yeah, I know. I didn't tag along with the other bum boys who put him in your house. I'm touched. It was a protest for the dog. I see you took my advice. Ugh, yeah I see what you done there. Work on that cardio thing, like when you're hunting me down like Kunta Kinte. 'Cause I gassed out and I would let you run at, Don't do that. Do what? Make a Kunta Kinte comparison. There's no parallel to your experience and roots. Bro, I don't know what the fuck roots is, but, maybe you can just accept the fact that I bought these shoes because they're practical for my needs. And what are your needs? Stay out of trouble. We all have our fair share of trouble owed to us, you're no different. But maybe you're far enough right on the intelligence bell curve to embrace what it brings. And what's that? Problems to solve. Shh. Come in. Tahu wants to meet you. You're the reason that I came back early from my pig hunt, eh boy? Shit. When I heard you were the Baron's only spawn, I didn't know whether to jizz or shit my pants! You know what I've concluded, my bro? Yeah what's that? I don't need to change my undies. Boy, get over here, hurry up! This is one of the youth from our pathways with the Z leadership programme. He's being tasked with the upkeep of the neighbourhood. Trying to keep him and his crew productive. Been a little bit over zealous, eh boy? Apologise to the son of the great Baron To'a. Fuck you! Sorry for taking your mower without asking. Get out of here. Hey, can we discuss the belt? Suits me, eh? Yeah, yeah. But it's a family heirloom. Heirloom, it's like, imagine if I took that. I think you'd want it back. This piece of shit? Take it, fucking thing stinks. What I mean is, imagine I took something immensely personal to you. Like this belt? I'll just come and take it back. Logic. Friend, we got off to a bad start. But it's because of a shared enemy. Wayne? Yeah, psycho cop. Wayne's too pussy to be an enemy of mine. What I'm trying to say is the raid wasn't my doing. Oh, here we go, boys, here we go! A change in negotiation strategy eh? First, the diplomatic approach. Then the assertive approach. What's next, the numbers? Ooh. Okay, how much? Bro. You can't buy a thing like this. Shit! Let's feast! Yeah! Here we go boy. You two, look after our guest for Uncle Tahu. Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing? Belt's mine. The belt belongs here, bro. With the community. Your deceitful actions are proof of that, cuz. Yeah well I don't think the Baron will approve of you being custodians. Oh. The Baron To'a will be embarrassed to see the title claimed this way. Hey, I respect your balls. But Tahu cannot abide. The Baron Death Elbow! Get him up! Move it, bounce. What a stink firecracker. Boys, open the gate! Outside, boy. Welcome to air Tahu! Oh you wanna drive my Cowboy? I think my left hand's got something to say about that. Left one has said, let's hear from the right. Wanna hear him again? What you gonna say now huh? Wait wait wait wait! Hey! How's this for height? Yeah, that's what happens to the stink cloud boy, yeah. Now for my specialist discipline. The facial crush! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Otts, I gotta go before the cops get here. I don't wanna be seen as a narc. Hey hey no need for theatrics. How hard it gets, remain clarity. You talk too much. That's why you're laying here. I'm gonna nod off soon. You need to know something. What? I want a shot at the title. Oy. Dad, Dad, Dad! Dad, Pantheons of Slam is on Sky! Dad? Dad? Sorry, son. Dad? Lace, go get Otto. Steady. You're awake now. Why'd you put me in Dad's room? That was my idea. Your room's too small and isolated downstairs. First time you'd been in here since he died, eh? I could hear you snore groaning through the wall. Your room is on the other side? Sure wish it wasn't. Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful. Easy, To'a. Easy. What's broke? How we know? No x-ray here. I'd say you've at least cracked some ribs, possibly some fractures. Sound like a doctor already. You should really get it checked. Yeah. Drink. - Mm-mmm. - How do you think your father repair so fast after each fight? Well he had a heart attack pretty young. Some aren't born to grow old. Tastes horrible. Oh and then Matzo's like what, what? Boo, boo far! Oh and then Rexo does the carvo, it was all on knee! Whoah I mean you gotta wonder, eh? How tough that guy is standing up to Tahu like that? I mean, specially being outnumbered like that. I mean you gotta be too tough or too stupid. Hey, hey, what's up with this nodding shit eh? Hey hey who you represent, eh boy? Hey! Otto. We need to get some order back into this place. Calm down Otto. That's just the way things are now. It's not the 80s anymore, man. Wayne. Otto. Just here to talk to your nephew. Wayne wants to talk to you. Just here to ask you a few official police questions. Hey Fritz, looking well. This left testicle of a street's got some stories. I'll give it that. It's known peace for five years now. Shit, whatever order it had, it worked. I did what I had to do to show you who the real puppet master was. I'll just close this door, eh? You don't know who you're messing with here, boy. You are just small fry around here. Right now I'm dealing with a guy who became a cop because he was too drop nuts to be a criminal. Like I said, you don't know who you're messing with, boy! I can assure you, my face will be the last you see. I am your awakening! What the hell are you doing, you mad bastard? Renee, honey. Don't call me honey, it's creepy. Look, I'm just asking him some police questions, all right? You're such a weak prick, Wayne. Where's that tough guy act when he kicked your ass the other night? Hey, please don't be like that. What are you still doing here, asshole? Thanks. Why would To'a agree with three on one like this? The Undercover Bandits and Steve Steel ain't no chumps. No, it's insane Lance. But it was To'a's idea. The Baron runs on his own logic. Solid chop to the neck. The Green Fiend flies into the mat. Swept each other off the top rope, boom! They felt that slam in China. Intercept, intercept by the Baron! Bot auto aids the Baron in disarming the fiend. A Polynesian elbow courtesy of the South Pacific. Boom, suplex into a bodyslam! That was his last fight. Yeah. Why the Baron? You know we got some German in the family. The name Fritz, not from China. Well the Germans were the first superpower in the Pacific to sign the treaty with Tonga. I'm sorry. The stories we come up with from the shows we make up from the street. This one there actually happened. Your father, ooh. He fight three guys, man. I know real life fights don't happen like that. That's entertainment. But it don't make the show if it not happen in real life. Three brothers, they move in. Trying to set up a tinny house. It's not we have a problem with the weed, just too many cars, man. Hey, why you park like that on the foot path, you think you own the street? Just looking to score the weed, toho. Hey, the kids are coming back from school. Where do you want them to walk, all over the road? Hey, are you the Baron To'a? Move the car otherwise you're gonna find out. I saw you come here. What did I tell you guys before, eh? You parking the car on the road, the kids are coming back from school! - Calm down, relax. - Hey, hey. What's a lot of work - for the big man? - Hey, relax, I want to talk. But he's a tough guy. - Tough? - Hey. - Are you sure? - You think you're tough? Are you sure? Okay. What happened? What, what you gonna do with this? Okay. I told you before. You don't listen! Look what happened! Stupid! What did I tell you? Stop parking on the front! How'd you guys cope with being outnumbered? You don't hear of the potato principle? The what? Potato principle. You only need to get a few. The ones who do most of the bullshit. You mean the Pareto principle. You say Pareto, I say potato. Shit. Look at him. Why didn't they give a shit that he got ran over? Smiley simply lost his utility. I'll help you bury him. You'll say a few words? Amen. So be it. Want a tilly? Hux got upset because I credited you. You didn't have to do that. What, speak the truth? What truth? That it's the weak who are cruel and the strong who are merciful. That's pretty profound. Why do you have to call attention towards profundity? It just took me by surprise, that's all. 'Cause I'm from the hood? From the hood? You gotta stop this victim shit, man. If anyone's a victim, it's me. Well at least you got choices. And what are they? Finish what you start or fuck off. So much for third alternatives. Hey. I'm sorry about your dog. He wasn't my dog. I get the hint, Uncle. Hey, you were the one that wanted a shot at the title. 60 second rest and then on to drills. Go, more condolences. Keep training like this, you'll be the next Baron in no time. Baron von Fritz! - Hey, Fritz! - Do you know how it was always gonna come to this? It's the way things are. Yeah but there are ways and then there are ways. We start training tomorrow. You kidding. For me there's three important things in my life. The first is respect and love for yourself. Two is respect and love for your people. And three, respect and love for other people. And then when you get those three together, Yes, and synergy. And the mind, the body and the soul transcends. He knows what I'm saying because he help me. Otto's my number one guy. So this is the way a champion live. Be good, don't be stupid. Chisel that shit in granite. Have you been pumping, boy? You training for something? Just working on becoming a better man. Oh, looking to better a man, I'd say. You know I used to be a hardcore fella back in the day. Not like your old man though. Heard he was pretty special. But as I got older I realised a man's gotta use the wisdom that he's gained over the years to pave a better future for himself. Working with the way things are and not how they're supposed to be. Aye, and what happened? I stopped swinging at shadows. What's your angle, George? Whoah, amped up bro? A good workout will do that to a man. You know there's something about a guy who tries to get along with everyone that really irks me. I'm gonna have to rethink you, George. Well, look at me as the Sac diplomat. Well there's diplomacy and then there's just fence-sitting. Well it's better to be sitting on a fence than to be thrown through one. Hey Carey. Nice beard. Yeah, it's 'cause yeah yeah. Skyrockets against thugs, pretty stupid idea. It's childish. I'm sorry. What's with the roll bar? Okay. Here you are, yeah, all right. Gonzalez. No, that's crazy. Yeah, okay maybe not that crazy. Look, Carey, I just don't want you to get involved with this anymore. When my dad died? This place went to shit. And I get that, I know how much he meant to you, to everybody, okay, but I've gotta take the title, just me. I know you have my six. Please, Carey. Once I do this, everything will go back to normal, okay? Just don't do anything stupid. I've got it. All right, come on. Show me what you got. You're too keen. First rule, control the emotion, - control the moment. - Okay. Hey, nice! - Well done. - What the hell are you doing? Mom, Mr. Fritz is just showing me some moves! He's always finding himself in compromising positions. You, inside, now, wash up. Where are your shoes? I don't know. Oh my god. Go now. See you, Fritz. She's got spirit, that one. Like you. Where's her father? On and off with her mother, last time I checked. Sorry, I didn't realise you were still with him. She's my niece. I raised her, that's why she calls me mum. Her mum's not exactly a maternal type. You seem to be doing a good job. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why are you selling? Otto doesn't wanna leave. Oh he told you that? He doesn't have to tell me that. I just know from how proud he is of your family legacy and this street. Yeah, and my father. He talks way more about you than he does your dad. Right. He doesn't even really know what I do. Proud nonetheless of who you are. How come you never visit him? Well. If you asked me 10 years ago, I would have told you I felt like I disappointed him. But looking back now, I know I just needed to find my own way, make my own mistakes, be my own man. Is that how you found your way back home? Everyone likes to point out irony? I'm pointing out the poetry, okay? So all of your searching has led you to arrive back where it all began. Perhaps you're getting to know this place for the first time. T.S. Eliot. Well, it's a shame we didn't get to meet earlier. Could have gotten off to a better start. No there's no evidence to suggest that. What about you? Why haven't you left this shithole? It's not a shithole. It's not. Just lacks good character. What keeps you here? The place needs good character. Right, see you. If you find those shoes. What do you mean no go? I just got to finish what I started. That's right. You need to finish what you started back here. No, here. No, here! No, here. No, here! What's really there for you, Fritz? A renaissance. Fritz, you spent five years developing an online programme that presents people with a list of executive decision outcomes based on their situation and personality type and you go say something irrational like that! What do you want me to tell the investors? Tell them, tell them first things first. I've got unfinished business. Hey mate, forget the house. If you can't sell it, I will lend you the money. This is your unfinished business! The hell was that? Look at that thing. Shouldn't have drove the trolly without a warrant of fitness, bro. ♪ Your mate, your mate ♪ ♪ Your mate is on fire ♪ Hey! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Calm down, 'cause it's just a bloody go kart. Carey! We need to get him onto his back. Try and keep him conscious. Fire in the hole! That's what happens when you drive. Somebody call an ambulance, please! All right? Why are you just standing there? Hurry up! You right? There you go. There you go, Carey. Look at me. Okay, look at me. Stay with me, okay? Son? Are you sure? I've had it with this place. I'm trying to move forward. But everything and everyone reminds me of you. How much you mean to people. How much you mean to me. Is that why you want to sell my house? Who told you you have to be like me? Broken, broken. Broken. You are not a wrestler. But you are To'a. Go. Hey! Hey, it's me, it's me, it's me. Don't sneak up on someone like that. Sorry I frightened you. Man! How's Carey? He's better than yesterday. Still not out the danger zone. Are they face painting in bouncy castles? His PR campaign starts tomorrow at the community barbecue. It's in honour of your dad. You going? Nah. Hey. Thanks for being here. Here here or just here? Fritz! Jeez, oh! Tap out, tap out! Wow. Did you teach her that? Yeah, maybe. Thanks a lot. Good night. Good night. Who am I to you? Another party. I'm gonna get the belt back tomorrow. You sure you're ready? Nope. To'a! I think he's ready! You think you're going to do an exam? No one starts a war without first being clear in his mind about what he intends to achieve by the war, and how he intends to conduct it. Carl von Clausewitz. Same guy. Just go fight, man. All right. A better you and a better me. Shh, What the hell are you up to? We thought you were prepping, Fish. Eh? Your lack of height is a gross disadvantage. Take your shot. Oh, what have you done? That's an open fracture, bro. Just chuck some ice on it, you'll be sweet. Here, bite on this. You know as a fellow Tongan I thought you'd have better bone density than that. First step Otto is to immobilise whoever I can before entering the compound. Hey. Where's the rhythms gone? Noise control. Oh yeah? I've got a permit for that. Eh, eh? I never really got why good girls dug the pretty boy badass dudes. I find your ilk extremely hollow. I can't help that my face obeys nature's golden ratio. That's a really considered answer. Guess I'm not just a pretty face, huh. I don't think you got that going for you anymore. I don't think your thinking can help with the crazies. These bats are aluminium. They don't have the compact mass you're looking for. Not like my foot. Ah yeah the kick. You got big feet. Just fight, dick. Just stop! I'm not into this. It's not you, it's me, so take a free pass while I'm giving them out. All right, let's make it interesting. Come on, it's got better density than the bat. Your desire's in excess of your talent. You gotta work on your EQ IQ ratio. Sleep well. Fortune favours the prepared. Some things you can't prepare for. Well most actions are predictable. The key to controlling the random variables is to stop them from happening. How you gonna do that? I force the play. I think I like this man. Fritz, I forgot to tell you. Never mind. Better you learn things organically. Why are you so angry?! What's what, dick? Where's my belt!? Where's Tahu? How do I know? Just follow him on Instagram, you dick. Less is more, Bro. Look at this guy. Hey! What do you think of my technical gear, cuz? Ready to see some technics? Food ain't gonna taste so good now, eh? Where's my belt?! Fritz! Not the title fight. What? Finish it. What? Who do you think you are?! Who do you think you are? Me? How does a man your size get beat like a baby seal?! Useless prick! This place had peace before you came bringing your shit. Your father would have been proud. What do you know about my father? Ah, you fancy yourself, eh boy? But you are nothing like your father. What did I tell you? Stop parking on the road! Wow! Can I have your autograph Mr. Baron? Is that your son? Oh. Son, I'm sorry yeah? Sorry boy, I don't know. Don't be like your dad, eh? You can be anyone you want to be, eh? Thank you. Stay in school. You got manners, son, use it. The old man, he moved the tinny house to somewhere with less hassles. But I knew, I knew that I would be back. 'Cause someone has to be the Chief To'a of these displaced rabble. What? I forgot to tell you the rest of the story. Why would you leave that out? There are ways and then there are ways to learn. This is the title fight. You come into my street and you try and change how things are done. Too much speed work. Not enough power training. Oh, you want the belt? Huh, you wanna be top dog, do you boy? Not enough out there for you huh? Now. You wanna come here and you wanna take my street. No, no, no. My house, my people, my cul-de-sac, you hear me? This is my street! Lacey! You know, that's real Machavellian of you, George. Yeah. Like your stink ass. Yeah, okay. The Baron would have loved this storyline. Depends how it ends. I am a lion! And these are my musty balls! And this is my Sac! Hux! Finish him off. I'm sick of wasting sweat on that fool. Royden. I underestimated your black nuts. You know George, if you wanna spiel off to the rest of the world about being a lion, why call yourself a pig hunter? Why don't you shut your... Lacey! That wasn't as random as it looked. We've been rehearsing. It'll really boost her confidence. Mum, we're a tag team! Ah, no, that doesn't make us a tag team. What? Come on, hon. Who the fuck do you think you are?! To'a! What the hell is going on here? Piss off, Wayne. Nobody needs you around here. That's my girl. Otto, did you see my assisted two foot swing? Come on, inside. What's the next step? Where your helmets? Get some damn helmets.
