Otto Barfuss, beer king, declares war on gangsters. Well, does he mean it or will he play ball with us? He's scared enough now to sign anything. - Don't be too sure. - Well, why not rub him out? No, not yet, we've gotta handle this with kid gloves. - You're all over the front page now. - Yeah, suppose the kid gloves don't work. Well, that's for you to figure out. Sam, I'll have you and, um... Himey call on Barfuss tonight and put the pressure on him. - Okay. - That's good. All right, you fellows. There's your money. - $25,000. - Five, ten, twenty, twenty-five. Okay. - And here's your membership certificate. - Thank you. And remember, you're gonna pay us a dollar a barrel. And we'll check up on it. - Hm, pretty steep, ain't it? - Uh-uh. What do I get for that? You get protection against accidents, Mr. Barfuss. Yeah, they had a bad accident over at the Hercules Brewery the other day. - So? - Sometimes people get hurt in those accidents. Certainly, why don't you put it on that dotted line there... ...and everything is going to be sweet and rolling. Okay, Mr. Barfuss, you don't have to go any further. So you're gonna put the finger on us, huh? Not only the finger, I'm going to give you the whole fist. I'm going to see that not one brewery joins your organization. - Ou, you are, are you? - Yes. - Pardon me, won't you? - Hey, wait a minute, you can't do this. - We got lawyers. This is legitimate. - Plenty of them. Yes, yes, you've got lawyers. And I've gotten an open and shut case of extorsion against you boys... ...and you're going away for a nice, long rest. Alright, boys, take these fellows out. Wait a minute, wait a minute... Just a minute, buddy. Trying to pull a fast one, eh, you dirty little rat, you. It's good he didn't get away. Did he get you? Oh, not much. - Hold it, Mark! - Say, do you know who that is? Young Lombardo, the big fellow's brother. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Here we are, boss. Turn that car around and be ready to go. - Hello, Jake. - Oh, hello, Ricco. - I was just trying to get the hospital. - I just came from there. Put it here, Hilda, will you? Will you have a drink? That's not a bad idea. - How's the kid? - He's in bad shape. Oh, this house, this room, gives me the willies. Bars on the windows, why don't you get rid of the place? - I'm trying to sell it. - Why don't you burn it down? It's been our hang out long enough. I wonder what's the matter with me. It's that kid. I wish you could have seen him, Jake. And the blood transfusion didn't do any good? Nothing seems to do any good. Just lays there white as a sheet. Oh, why did this have to happen to this brother of mine? You know I promised the old lady I'd take care of him and... keep him out of this racket... and now this. - And if that kid dies. - Well, don't blame me for it. Well, he shouldn't have been there. And somebody's gonna pay for it. - Sure, Otto Barfuss. - Yes, Barfuss. But before he gets to the governor, how are you gonna do it? Just as you said, with kid gloves. It's got to be one of those mysterious accidents. Nothing crude. I will scare the life out of the rest of those legitimate brewers. - But I want it done quick, see? - Yeah, I'm working on it now. But none of my boys could figure a way out. Well, get them in here! We've gotta have some action. - Oh, Bennie. - Yeah? Send Slim in here. You two guys come in. I brought a young torpedo from Detroit. Slim Scanlon by name. Very quick with the lead. Maybe he can do something. - Never heard of him. - Oh, sure you did. He cleaned up that whole Ruby Gerson mob all by himself. Oh, yeah, yeah, Max... Maxie was telling me about that. - Hello, Mr. Lombardo. - Hello. We ain't met, but I recognized you from your descriptions. Oh, you're that squirt from Detroit. - Do you know what we want? - Yeah, I heard about it. Otto Barfuss. I don't like it. What protection will I get to keep out of that hostseat? That's for Jake to figure out. All I'm saying is I want it done quick, get me? It won't take long. Want to see us, boss? Oh, yeah, we were just talking about Barfuss. Herman, tell Mr. Lombardo that notion of yours. Oh, yeah, sure. Well, how about planting a couple of droppers... ...on the second or third story across the way from where he lives? Oh, I thought he had something new. Go back to your drugstore and peddle your dope. - But listen... - Oh, shut up, you can't do it that way. You'll have the cops of the world on your tail. Well, I wouldn't mind that, but when they get you, they get me. Yeah, I know, it's gotta be done clean, quick and quiet. Yes, and that's your department. Get my hat and coat. I gotta go back to that hospital. Oh, your boss will figure out a way. That's what I got him for. All right, Jake. Jake. - I just had the hospital on the phone. - Yeah? The kid's dead. This is a private road! I'm terribly sorry, but there's something the matter with the engine. - What's the matter with the engine? - I don't know. You see, er... It just stopped. Well, you and your girlfriend can go and stop your engine some place else. Go ahead! Sunday drivers. - What's the matter with it? - Darling, if I knew, I'd fix it. - Could it be the carburetor? - The what? Carburetor. You've got the choke pulled out. Oh, don't be silly, dear. You have to pull that out. Yes, that's the first thing that I learned. Well, this may take a few minutes. No, no, it's all right. - There's the carburetor. - What are we going to do? If Father finds out that we haven't turned up at the Simpkins, he'll suspect something and it'll be awful. Yes, and there isn't any time to lose. Say, I wonder... I think I'll go up to that house and phone for a mechanic. Oh, let's get a taxi. I'd rather be married first and get a mechanic afterwards. - Why are you so beautiful? - Can I help it? No. - Hurry up. - I will. Hope there's somebody home. - Well? - How do you do? My car's broken down, may I use your phone? - Just a minute. - Se, we were... - Who is it? - There's a funny looking bozo out there, He says maybe he can use the phone. His car is busted. - Does he look like trouble? - Say, you could put him in your pocket. - Tell him to come in. - Okay. You two birds fade. Drift back a little later just in case. Remember, you're friends of mine, dropped in for a drink. Keep your traps shut. Better stick around, Charlie, but not too conspicuous. How do you do? How are you? My car is stalled out there. May I phone for a taxi? - Sure, help yourself. - Thank you. - Call Yonkers 5050. - Thank you. I didn't know that this was a private road. - Oh, no? - Yonkers 5050. - I must have taken the wrong turn. - I see. What... oh, it's busy, Oh, that's too bad. Will you have a drink while you're waiting? Oh, no thanks, no, I'm afraid, um... Oh, you needn't be, I import this stuff myself. Oh, no, I mean I'm afraid I haven't time. - Oh, you got time for one anyway. - No, thank you. - Will you have scotch or rye? - No, thank you. I'll have a little scotch. - Some rye drop? - Just a splash, please. Just... whoa! That's fine. Thanks. Well... to crime. I say, that's very mellow. You'll have to put me on to your bootlegger. That's easy. Well. Yonkers 5050. - Nice room you have here. - Yes, this room was done by an artist. Oh, is that so? Yes... very nice. What... Oh, damn me, busy. You know, this is most embarrassing for me. - In what way? - Well, you see, we were, um... That is, um... I was on my way to get married. And the young lady's father, he doesn't like me very much. - Oh, eloping, eh? - Oh... yes, in a way. Why don't you ask the young lady to come in? - Oh, no, thanks, she'll wait. - Have you found a place to live yet? No. You know, we were thinking me might settle up here somewhere. - Near the Hudson. - Say, this house is for sale. - Oh, I don't think so... - Oh, listen, We've got a fine view of the Hudson right from this window here. Oh, splendid! You know, I, um... I was so surprised when I came to that, um... I was surprised. Oh, this is Mr... I didn't get your name. He didn't get your... Oh, mine? I'm sorry. - Porter. - Mine's Dillon. - How do you do? - How are you? Mr. Shaw, Mr. Porter. How do you do? I mean, how do you do? - How do you do? - And Mr. Lefkovitz, Mr. Porter. - How do you do? - Uh... How do you do? - Have a look? - Thanks. - Swell view. - Yes, yes, it must be. Oh, I see, yes, through that tree. You think this place would suit you, Mr. Porter? Well, it might. It seems quiet and secluded. - It's all of that. - How about the neighbors? Say, listen, you could yell your head off out any one of these windows... - ...and nobody'd ever hear you. - Well, that's perfect. I bought it from a painter guy. It's called the Granville place. Let me give you another drink, Mr. Porter. Oh, no, thank you. No, I always know when I've had... Oh, come on, let me be hospitable, won't you? Well, my goodness, this positively must be my, uh... Yes... that'll be my last. Oh, this is Mr. Salvatore, Mr. Porter. - How do you do? - Hi. - And Mr. Scanlon, Mr. Porter. - That's funny. I knew there was somebody there too. - You know, you can always kinda... - How are you? How do you do? Hey, what is this, a club? No, I like to have my friends drop in for a drink. Boys, help yourselves. Pardon me, I beg your pardon. Pardon... uh... Well, to crime. Say, what is this gag anyway you're always drinking to crime? Well, why shouldn't I? Crime is my racket. Well, son, you don't look it. I know I don't. None of us do. Still I don't get it. You said crime was your racket. Yes, it is, you see, I write about crime. - Principally murders. - Oh, well what do you know about murder? Well, practically everything. I am probably the world's greatest living authority. How'd you get to be that? - By the simple method of using my brains. Let me tell you fellows something. The police seldom use their brains and the criminals, well... They haven't any. You said it. Why, in 1930, I solved one of the biggest murder mysteries... ...that ever hung up the department. - Big time stuff, hm? - I see I've rather taken you off your feet. Well, I don't like to brag, but, um... Just take a look at that, Mr. Dillon. "To Wallace Porter from M.J. O'Neill, Police Commissioner of New York, in appreciation of extraordinary services... September 12th, 1930." Extraordinary services for what? Well, it isn't a thing that I like to tell everybody. It might get me in trouble with the underworld. But I don't mind telling you fellows, that is, strictly in confidence, you understand. - Oh, sure, you can trust us. - Thanks. Um, pardon me. Well, I'd been following this case very closely in the papers. And just from what I had read, I worked out a theory as to how the crime was committed and who did it. Of course I didn't actually run the killer to earth myself, the police did that. But it was my idea that finally sent Red Jennings to the chair. Funny thing, Mr. Porter, I was interested in that case myself. Yes, everybody was. I used it as a basis for one of my novels. The Dance Hall Murder. Only I gave my murderer some brains so he'd be tough to catch. That's the trouble with all these professional killers. They haven't got the brains to get away with it. Just stiffen that, please. Of course, gangsters get away with a lot of killings amongst themselves. Thanks. Crime! But when it comes to a killing outside the underworld, it's ten to one that the cops get their men. That's what I say. When it comes to bumping off a regular citizen, especially if he's anyways prominent, it's just impossible for a guy to cover up his tracks. Oh, that's where you're wrong! - Oh, am I? - Positively! Not if he has the mentality to plan, and execute a perfect murder. My goodness, I forgot all about the taxi. Wait a minute, this phone is still out of order. - Oh. - Oh, um, Herman... Go out in the garage and use that phone to call up a taxi for Mr. Porter, hm? Okay, sure. Is Mr. Porter in here? Come right in, miss. No, thank you, no more. Well, Wally, what's the idea of keeping me waiting outside? - I'm broken to speakeasies. - Oh, darling, this is no speak. No, we phoned for the taxi and we were just having a little drink. - This is Miss Van Buren, Mr. Dillon. - How do you do? And, um, Mr. Shaw, and, um... Some of his friends. - I'm glad to see you, Miss Van Buren. - Mr. Dillon wants to sell his house. - What's yours? - Oh, nothing, thank you. And please don't give Wally any more or he'll buy the place. I'm not sure I like it well enough. You want I should show you around a little? Well, I'd like to, but we really haven't time now. We'll wait for the taxi outside, thank you very much. - Yes, we'll come for the car tomorrow. - You don't mind us leaving it here? No, it's alright with me, but before you go, I'd like to ask you something, Mr. Porter. When you start writing one of your books, you begin by planning what you call a perfect murder, is that it? Well, yes, yes, that's my method. I see, of course it may be okay in a book, but suppose... suppose you were up against it yourself, that you actually had to get a guy? Could you plan a way to do it so nobody would ever get you? Well, of course I could, but... up to the present while there are several people that I might like to kill, I haven't felt justified in going just that far. Well, how would you like to see what you could do along that line for me? - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Ah, wait a minute! This guy knows something, you saw he's smart, you heard his speel. It's not gonna cost us anything to see his cards. Yeah, but to see his cards, you gotta let him and her in on it. - What of it? - They'll rat! Oh, don't be so dumb. - Now then... - Excuse us, Mr. Dillon, but we got to go. - Sit down. - We have an engagement. - Well, forget it! - We can't, it's a party... ...and I wouldn't miss it for anything. Yeah, well you're gonna miss it and you're gonna miss a lot of other parties... ...if little Porter doesn't come through. - What are you trying to do, frighten him? - Shut up! Wally, are you gonna stand for that? Here, Mr. Dillon, you forget yourself. You shouldn't be so rude to Mrs. Van Buren. Then you tell her to shut up! Don't be silly, you can't keep us here. No? Well, how would you like to have me lock you up in the top story? I'll take her up, boss, I kinda like blondes. Now, now... You want me to do something for you. Well, unless Miss Van Buren stays here, I won't even consider it! Ah, get out of my way! Guys don't say "I won't" to me. Let me help you, darling. Did he hurt you, Wally? Only here and there. I didn't really hit you, I only gave you a shove. Hi, Hilda, you got something good? Go ahead, boys. - Come on, you take off that coat. - No. - You two can eat with us. - No, thank you, I'm not hungry as I was. You heard me. Now, you might as well eat because both of you are gonna be here for a long time. Come on, come on. Hilda, turn on the lights. Those candles look like a church. I got 'em out of a church. Remember, I scraped me shins on one of them pews. - You like that soup? - Hm? Oh... yes. Thanks. Well, that's fine. You know, this proposition oughta be duck soup for you. There's a big guy got it all set to put a lot of us out of business. And before he gets going too strong, we gotta stop him. And you want me to tell you how to... to... - Exactly. - Oh... that's murder. And I'd be just as guilty as you. Yeah, but it'll make you keep quiet afterwards. But I... couldn't really help you kill a man. No? Well you've done a lot of blowing. Now, what would you rather be at a funeral, a mourner or a corpse? Well, of course, if I had my choice. - Who is it that you want me to kill? - Otto Barfuss. You know him? - Otto Barfuss? - Yeah. The brewer? Why, he's one of the best men that we have in this city. That's why we can't wipe him out without getting into trouble. That's why we're putting it up to you. Do you mean to say that you can sit here, and eat and talk about murdering a man? Yeah. Well, I simply can't do it. - He means he won't. - Well, you can't get away with that. Nobody'll miss you anyhow. Books are a drug on the market. It's Otto or you. I can't do it. Well, I'm not going to waste much time arguing with you. So make up your mind or it's curtains. - Do you hear that? - Yeah, I hear it. Well, you'd better do something about it. After all, we don't know this man Barfuss. He doesn't mean anything to us. What difference does that make? How can you be so inhuman, dear? - Haven't you any moral sense? - No! Not when it comes to deciding whether something dreadful has got to happen... ...to you or to somebody I only read about in the newspapers. That's the most selfish remark I've ever heard. How... how can you sit there and eat like that? Oh, stop trying to be noble, I'm hungry. Well, I won't do it, no matter what happens to me. Hm, well what about the girlfriend? You wouldn't... you wouldn't do anything to her. No, not me personally, but Joe seems kind of interested. I'm kinda good with dames. That's a filthy way to try and put pressure on him. Don't speak to him, dear, don't speak to him. - I'll do it. - And no more arguments? - No. - Good! Now, the sooner you finish this job, the sooner you get out of here. - Well... - Uh-huh. Do you understand? Yes, but it must be thoroughly understood... ...that when I turn over the plan, Miss Van Buren and I can go. - Oh, sure. - You see, Miss Van Buren's father, he isn't... well, he isn't really very fond of me. - No? - No, he doesn't know that we, um... I mean, he thinks that... Well, I guess you're right. - It's most embarrassing. - How long will it take you to do the job? Job? Oh... the job. Why... How... how soon do you want it? Tomorrow. That makes it perfect. Barfuss is leaving for Buffalo tomorrow night to meet the governor. Oh, do you get Charlie's idea? Barfuss does not come back to New York. We do the job in Buffalo. And if Barfuss changes his plans, you'll hear from me. - Thanks. - Now, um... - What do you need to work with? - Just a new set of brains, that's all. Well, we'll get some pencils and some papers. And then we'll fix things so you can work without being disturbed any. Now, there are two bedrooms on the second floor, Hilda will show them to you. I don't need a bedroom. If I get sleepy, I'll curl right up down on the sofa. It's alright with me, I'm broadminded. But I don't want anything to interfere with his work. Now, I won't be here all the time, but Hilda will treat you good. I'll just go to the car and get our bags. No, Joe'll get them for you. He's gonna guard the front door. - You hear that, Joe? - Huh? Oh, yeah, sure, boss. Now, is there anything I can do for you, Miss Van Buren? Yes, drop dead. Not me, wish that on Mr. Barfuss. I guess that's everything. Charlie, you'd better check up. Well, see you tomorrow. Oh, are you going out too? Yeah, but I'm leaving a couple of boys in the garage, they'll look after you. So don't try anything funny. Oh... what an assignment. Oh... what an assignment. I know it, dear, but you've got to go through with it. Now, come on, Wally, get going. Here's everything, paper and pencils and even rubbers. Darling, do you think that all I have to do is to sit down there... ...and it comes running off the end of the pencil? Well, then, for heaven's sake how do you do it? I don't know. I don't know! What are you doing? Thinking. - Say, how would it be if you... - No, that's terrible. Oh, wait a minute! Hello, operator? Can you hear me? I can't talk louder. I can't talk any louder. I can't talk any louder. No... yes... Now listen carefully. No, he isn't here. Somebody was trying to, um... I told them that... that... Joe, disconnect that telephone. You know, there's one thing I almost passed up. The telephone. Of course it wouldn't have been of any use to you, Porter. Joe, if anybody wants to reach me, tell them to use the garage phone and park that thing in the tool house. Right, boss. Now get the brain to working, baby. And remember. All you gotta do is show us how to kill one guy to save the two of you. Goodbye, I'll be seeing you. Hey, where's Herman? He's in the back. - Hello, Charlie, how are you? - Never mind how I am, fill this order. Say, it's about time I get an order from.. - Who ordered it? - Little Wally, the brain trust. Hey, schlemiel, come here a minute. Say, this looks like business. Here, get that. Come on, make it snappy, please. You'll have to wait a minute. I have to get this myself. Alright, but hurry up, I haven't got any too much time. Okay, Charlie. Oh, Wally, this is perfectly marvelous. Why, it's the best one you've ever written. Mr. Barfuss is as good as dead right now. Darling, what time is it? - Ten o'clock. - Dillon will be here any minute. - What's this sugar for? - Oh, don't you ask questions. Well, I think I could understand it even if I'm not so bright. Oh, you don't have to be bright. No, you're so beautiful. Now, until the next move, this goes... In here. I hope nothing goes wrong with your plan, because if it does, I'll bet they'll think of some very nasty way to murder us. Darling, how many times have I asked you not to use that word? Oh, don't be so jittery. I'm not jittery, but it's foolish to think that Dillon will let us go. You know, I wouldn't take his word not if it were wrapped in... cellophane. - I wonder... - Wally, I have an idea. Suppose I try vamping Joe. - No! - Well, he seems to like me. No, the very idea is revolting. - Anyway, I'm going to try. - I forbid it positively! - We're not married yet. - No? And maybe we never will be. Well, just the same, you're going to mind me. I'd like to see you make me. Oh, you would, eh? Well you sit down and behave yourself! - You big brute! - Oh, baby, did I hurt you? Ouch! - You struck me. - Yes. And if you don't behave yourself, I'll strike you again. Oh, Wally! Isn't love terrible? It isn't love. It's being engaged that's tough. You know, you'll have to understand one thing. I will be obeyed. - Gee, ain't you brutal? - What, um... - What do you want? - A cigarette. - Well, go and get it! - Wally! I'll get it. Better hurry, or daddy will wallop your panties. Say, you know, that's a naughty dame. I kinda like them that way. Give me a femme that's full of steam. Okay with me. You're kind of full of steam yourself tonight. What's got you all hopped up? I'm not hopped up, I'm annoyed. If you want to see someone that's hopped up, look at Dillon. I wonder that your gang has any confidence in him. What do you think? He's my boss. Well, you can't tell me that you like having a boss. What's that to you? Oh, nothing, but there's something about you that interests me, Slim. You're not like the rest of this gang. You're, um... a cut above them if you know what I mean. I've got an idea that you're fed up with this whole outfit. Isn't there something you'd rather do than stick to this racket? Are you propositioning me? Uh-huh. That's out. Well, that's too bad. I suppose you'll go on taking the most terrifying chances for a few dollars... ...and pass up the easiest and safest way in the world of making, say... Ten thousand bucks. I thought you had better sense. Wait a second. - Ten grand. - Hm-hmm. Nix. Leave it open. Dillon will be here any minute. I've got my plan all ready for him. And he's bound to fall for it. That doesn't mean that he's going to let Miss Van Buren and me go. At least I'm not counting on it. So, to be on the safe side... Now listen here, Porter. You'd better get that plan finished because Jake is very funny. If things aren't right when he comes back, he'll be sore as a boil. I got the plan all ready. Oh. I take it that you're interested then. - You wanna figure on a getaway. - Yes. Cover that door. Scram! If you please. Now, um... when Dillon goes to carry out the plan, ...and everything's quiet here, you'd better knock that Hilda on the head. If we're followed, I'll let you do the shooting. In five minutes we'll be safe. - What's the matter with that plan? - Nothing. It's worth ten grand. Here's your check. - He did? - Keep your trap shut. See you later. Alright, Hilda, scram. Come on, Charlie. Hey, put that thing away, will you, you're a big boy now. - Hello. - How are you? Charlie, call Slim. Hey, Slim! Come here! - Are you ready for us? - Yes. Well, it's about time. - Hello, Slim. - Hello, boss. - How are you, boy? - Slick. Cigarette? Thanks. Hello, Coss. Where's Herman, have you seen him, Porter? No. Have you brought everything that I asked for? Don't worry, I got everything. Toothbrushes, toothpaste, rubber gloves. And this. And if that isn't all, it isn't my fault. Hey, Boss, did you see this? What is it? The author has got his picture in the paper. Look it. - May I see it? - Sure. Come on, Porter, is everything okay? - Well, they didn't spell my name right. - I mean have you got everything. Oh, yes, yes, everything but the train reservations. - Here you are. - Thank you. - New York-Buffalo 121. - That's tonight, you understand. It has to be tonight. Lower berth number 7, car 63. That cost me plenty. That lower 7 is straight across the aisle from the one that Barfuss has got. Who's going to use these? I'll tell you that when we know what your plan is. Very well, that's your prerrogative. Come on, get on with it! Certainly. Pardon me. - Chair, please. - Joe. Coming up, boss. Now, this is... Thank you. This not only to be an explanation. It is also to be a demonstration of exactly what has to be done. Joe, you'd better get an earful, you may have to be in on this. - Thanks. - Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to see this. - Why be so rough about it? - Oh, leave her be. - What does she think she... - Gentlemen, gentlemen! - Don't get tough! - Silence, please! Let me have your undivided attention if you know what that means. Well... now this should be cyanide of potassium. - Well, that's what you ordered, ain't it? - Absolutely. This is the quickest and deadliest poison known to science. Come on, stop the lecturing and just show us the tricks. Well, this poison in addition to producing death almost instantaneously, is practically painless. - That means it doesn't hurt, Joe. - Who cares if it does? Well, in my plan it's important. There must be no evidence of agony. Hm, do you get it, boys? That'd be good. I always like to see a stiff look natural. Now, figure one, we squeeze a little of the toothpaste... ...onto the blade of a knife. With this dainty instrument, we dig a little of the paste out of the neck of the tube... ...leaving a small cavity. - That's a hole, Charlie, like in a tooth. - Oh, shut up! Now, figure two. For the sake of the demonstration, let us assume that this cigarette ash... ...is the deadly poison. We take a little of the ash so... ...and place it in the cavity we've just made. Then, figure three. We replace a little of the paste. And, figure four, we put on the cap... ...and a gentle squeeze of the tube to force a smooth mixture of the ingredients, - And there you are. - Yeah, but where does that get us? Watch me. Do you see that gray ash in the toothpaste? - Yeah. - Well, that represents the poison. When the man that you want to get brushes his teeth, the heavy flavor of the toothpaste disguises the odor of the poison. And naturally, he rinses his mouth and his brush... ...and a few minutes later ceases to exist. Oh, tripe, nobody swallows their toothpaste. Of course he doesn't! That's the beauty of it. Nothing must be found in the stomach... in case of an autopsy. - Yes, but how does it get him? - It gets him by... absorbtion. The tongue is like a sponge. And during the minute or two that the toothpaste is in our enemy's mouth, the tongue will absorb enough to kill him a dozen times over. Oh, it's terrible. Why do you want to go about killing people? Why can't we all be friendly? Come on, stop your beefing, we wanna get the rest of this. Of course. Now... Barfuss will be occupying lower berth number 8 tonight. You have a ticket for lower 7th. Where does a traveller keep his bag in a sleeping car? - On the floor under his berth. - On the floor under his berth. Where anybody can get at it during the night. Now, someone will be occupying that berth across from Barfuss. Someone with this packet of powder. At two or three in the morning, when the rest of the car is quiet, that someone will reach out and quietly possess himself of Barfuss' bag, take it into his own berth, and prepare Barfuss' own tube of paste as I have prepared this one. Another adroit move and the bag is back under Barfuss' berth. - I can't bear to think of it. - I can. - Sounds good to me. - I'll say. - What do you think of it, Slim? - Can't miss, sure fire. And in the morning, when Otto brushes his teeth... That's passing him a handful of clouds, eh? Oh, pardon me. I never heard of anything like that before. Me neither, that's the brain trust. We won't have any use for him around here anymore. - That stuff will put me out as an artist. - Thank you. Yeah, but listen, suppose he uses tooth powder. Ah, but he doesn't, right, Charlie? - He uses Brylo toothpaste. - How do you know? I got that information from the same place. Hey, Herman. Yeah? - Have you seen this gag? - Yeah, I'm gonna fix up the other two tubes. That won't be necessary. You'll only have to fix up Barfuss' own tube. That's alright, Herman, it's a good idea. You can't tell when it might come in handy. Sure. That's great, Porter. - Say, listen, supposing he don't brush his teeth. - Oh, we never thought of that. - All those guys brush their teeth. - Don't they? - Why, of course. Some people do it night and morning. - Why? - Listen, he knows. Well, it sounds funny to me, but you never can tell. Them canaries is liable to do anything. Does it make him holler? No, it's less painful than a bullet or even a knife. And it's far more positive any doctor will pronounce it heart failure. Charlie, this trick is right down your alley. Nobody could see this through like you. - Okay, Jake. - Here are your tickets. - And keep your eye on the time. - Oh, I'll make the train alright. I'll run home and change clothes. All I want out of this junk are these gloves. - And this packet of poison. - Oh, yeah. And be sure to get rid of that as soon as you've used all you need. Well, if anything goes wrong with this trick... It better not. You know, Charlie, that gives me an idea. No matter how good this layout looks to us, I think we ought to try it out first. You don't need to do that. - Do you understand, Charlie? - I'm for it. And it won't be hard to find somebody to try it on. Say, boss, you can try it out on a dog. Yeah, that's a great idea, Slim, that's a great idea. Now we'll see what kind of a dirty dog you are, Slim. You're not gonna try it out on me. Why not, you're the only palooka in this mob that ever tried to double-cross me. Why... you're wrong, boss. I wouldn't try to double-cross you, honest I wouldn't. Bennie, Cossy, get him! Hey, what are we? Herman, give me one of those things. Go through him. Nothing ever happens around this joint that I don't get on to. - Here's some letters and his wallet. - I want the wallet. For ten grand Slim was gonna try and help these babies do a getaway. You know what that would have done to us, Charlie? - It's a lie! - Why, you! Joe, come here. Slim is going out in the garage with Benny and the Cossack. It's up to you to see that he brushes his teeth. No, no, no, no! No, Jake, boss, please don't do this. Don't do this. I won't do it! You can't make me do it! Give me a gat and I'll shoot it out with the bunch of you. You're lying, you dirty... - Herman, clean up this junk. - This one has the poison in it. I'll keep that one separate. But later on when I go home, I'll take the cap off and chuck it in the river. I don't like this anyway. Alright, guess I'll shove along. Yeah, but before you go, take a look in the garage. You don't want to leave until you make sure. Okay. Oh, Hilda, a good drink of McCoy wouldn't go bad all around, I think. Scram. Well? What are we gonna do with it? Dump it in the closed truck out there and get away with it. How long did you say it would take that stuff to work, Porter? Hey, boss. Okay. I gotta hand it to you. You certainly know your stuff. Oh, Hilda. You saved Mr. Porter that ten grand tonight. He's not going to thank you for it, but I do. I'll not forget it. Scram. Say, boss, I could be caught breaking my rules. Go ahead, help yourself. Porter, you look as if a good shot would do you some good. - How about you, sister? - Don't speak to me. Now you know what happens to guys that don't play straight with me. Come on, Herman. - Are you going now? - Yeah. Well, as you go, will you ask one of the guys to bring my car to the front door? - Your car? - Yes, Joe says that it's fixed. What are you talking about? Well, I've given you the plan, and my job is finished and we're going now. What's the matter, kid, don't you like it here? Oh, yes, yes... But after all, this isn't home. Now don't let's kid ourselves. But you promised, now you've got to let us go. Yeah, and if I did, you two babies wouldn't have a lot to tell, would you? We wouldn't tell a thing, we give you our word of honor. Well, I got something better than your word, I got you. You're making a great mistake, Mr. Dillon. You saw that newspaper, there's an awful fuss over our disappearence. How would you and the boyfriend like to take a little sea trip tonight? I wouldn't be in a hurry about that, boss. Because if Mr. Porter's plan falls down tonight, you may want him to try and cook up another one. Don't I know that? If his first shot don't ring the bell, maybe the second will, huh? Oh, I got confidence in him, oh boy! I gotta pull myself together. - Perhaps a little drink would help. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Um, what about you, Toby? Oh, I don't care. Oh, I'll put a little white rock in yours. This gang takes you for a ride in a boat. In a b... They... they won't do anything like that to us. No... Stop thinking about it, will you? I can't help it. Can't you just see them taking us in the fast motor boat... ...out to sea and throwing us overboard where even our bodies will never be found? You don't have to ask me to see things. They probably tie a big rock or something around your neck. And Wally, we've only got a few hours. Listen, darling. I'm going to sit here where I can watch both doors. Didn't you see me juggle those little packets? - Uh-huh. - The one I put in my vest pocket... ...was a packet of poison. The one I gave to Charlie was a packet of sugar. Don't you see? Charlie's going off to poison Barfuss with a packet of powdered sugar. - Isn't that swell? - What's the good of that? What's the good of it? Why, it's marvelous. I've saved Barfuss' life and gained time for us as well. - Oh, that is marvelous! - Sure. Then, for the time being, we're just as safe as a bank. What bank? - Mr. Porter. - Yes? - What's the matter? - I just wanted to say goodbye. Oh, goodbye. Say, Herman, will you keep your lamps on these two lulus while I promote me a snifter? That's all I can do for you. The only one I got. You'll have to share it with me. See, I was going to take a bacon to my store, but... I'm kind of a softy. Yes, I can see that. Very thoughtful. I tell you, it's a lucky thing for this mob that I got drugstores. - Yes, yes, I can imagine. - No, not this one you can't imagine. You know, Charlie Shore just called me on the telephone in the garage. The damned fool changes his clothes, he does, and leaves the packet of poison you gave him in his other clothes. Hm, what's he doing about it? Oh, he did it already. You see, the big sap never knows he left the poison behind him... ...until he gets on the subway. Then it's too late for him to come back after it. So Charlie takes a chance of getting me here and I tell the clerk to give him the stuff. You see, so now Charlie has time to make the train with the poison. See? So, everything is Jake. Everything is Jake. Come on, come on, quick! - Is this number 63? - Yes, sir. Oh, I bet you forgot to put in my bag the pinochle deck. - But, Papa. - Your reservation, sir. Eight. Number eight, you know, downstairs, uh? - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Papa. - Bye-bye, Pop. - Goodbye, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Papa. _ Goodbye, Willie. - Goodbye. Be careful, Papa. Don't forget to send a telegram as soon as you get there. No, I'll send it right here from the train. Come here, my liebe... - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Pa. - Not too many pickles now! - Bye, bye, Papa! - Goodbye, children. Goodbye, Papa. - Don't forget about the pickles! - Goodbye, Papa! - Bye-bye. - Bye, Papa. Wally, you'd better not drink any more. You gotta keep your brain clear so you can think. Oh, darling, my brain won't work anymore. I'm worn out. Why don't you lie down on the couch and get a little sleep? No, no, I couldn't sleep in this room, it gives me the jitters. You're tired out, though. You lie down there and... ...and I'll keep watch. I wouldn't trust you. What do you mean by that? I wouldn't trust you to keep your eyes open. Oh. We'd probably wake up and find ourselves all cut up into small pieces. - Ooh! - Don't do that! Don't do what? Oh, you frightened me. What do you think my nerves are, steel girders? Your nerves'd be all right if you'd quit drinking that poison. Poison, don't be silly, darling. They only say that to frighten people. - Toby, where are you? - What's happened? - I'm blind. - Oh, don't be an idiot. - The lights went out. - Oh, I know it. Stay right where yous are. - Yes, sir. - Hey, Hilda, Hilda! - What happened? - Oh, that lunkhead blew out the fuse again. Hilda! Where do you think you're going? We aren't going anywhere. - Well, close that door. - Yes, sir. Hey! Come back here! Get over there. - Think I'm a dummy? - Yes... uh, no. Hilda! Hilda! Oh, there you are. Give them one of them flickers. If you please. You dopey witch, you ought to have your head examined. Wally, let's go upstairs and lock ourselves in the bedroom. What good would that do? They couldn't come at us from so many different sides. Oh, you poor little kid, of course. You come along with Wally. There she is again. Don't be frightened, dear, I'm with you. Here. Well, it's a cheery little place. Yes. Oh, and here are our bags all laid out. Well, I wonder what the other room is like. - Did you lock the door? - No. I'll lock it. - I'll go look. - All right. What are you doing? - I just fixed that door. - Oh. Oh... There. Say, which room do you want? We're both gonna stay right here. I locked the other one off. Oh. Well... we can't do that. Well, you're not gonna leave me here alone. I'm too nervous. Yes... yes... - It feels safer, only... - Only what? Oh... nothing, I was just thinking. But, well... under the circumstances. Yes, I guess it's... Yes... we'd both feel better. Of course we would. A lot better. - Only... - Only what? Well... I was just thinking about the appearences of the thing. Who's looking? Oh, Wally, don't be such a fool. Ah, sweetheart. Are... are you scared? No, you are. - Come here. - What? - Well, we can... - No, come here. Wally, you love me, don't you? Hm-hmm. - And we'd been married now if... - If it hadn't been for that carburetor. Do you realize that maybe we never will be? Hm-hmm. This may be the last night that we can... The last night we'll be alive. No, darling... you're getting all... all nervous. You know, you... Shh. You shouldn't talk like that. Oh... Oh! Our wedding ring. Would you like to have it now? Hm-hmm. Maybe it'd be bad luck. I'd kinda like to have it now anyway. Oh... I'll give it back to you when we... If we live long enough. Oh, darling, you're getting all... You're overwrought. You'd better go to bed. Huh? You'd better just go to bed. That's what I think. Now, you just wait right here and I'll be back in a minute. - Darling. - Yes? - You've left the door open. - Well, close it. That's right, dear, you keep your back turned. What are you doing? Oh... I forgot my nighties. I thought this was it when I packed, but it isn't. No! No, it isn't. Excuse me dear. You know, you... you shouldn't be so careless, darling. Well, I can't go to bed with my dress on. No, that's right. - Are you in bed, darling? - Uh-huh. Then good night, dear. Where are you going? Oh, just over here. I've got to do a lot of thinking. Thinking? What are you going to think about? Oh... I was thinking about your father. You know, he doesn't like me anyway. Why don't you think about me? I am, dear! Don't you suppose that I have any elemental impulses? Oh, don't use big words at me. - Can't you be human? - I am human, darling. You have no idea how human I am. But... oh, listen, darling. Always remember one thing about me. It's just this. I could not love thee, dear, so well, loved I not honor more. Oh, you're so wonderful! Go on and sing! Oh... oh, my sweet. Now. Wally, I'm frightened. Yes, I know, dear. Oh, God, help me to get her out of here. Just give me one good idea... ...now, and I'll never ask you for another. Joe! Uh? - What are you calling him for? - Shh! I thought Joe might like a cup of coffee. Well, now, that ain't a bad idea... Toby. Wally, give Joe a cup of coffee. - Now, if you'll excuse me. - Where are you going? Why, I'm just going to brush my teeth. Don't forget your toothpaste. Swell femme. Sugar me. One. Two. Three. Hey, what's the matter with you? Hello? Hey, Benny, get her! Hey, nix, nix! - You need any help? - Yes! Well, I got my hands on the phone. Hello, where are you? - What's the matter with this thing anyway? - Hello? Do you want me to sit here all night waiting for you? Where have you been? Yes, boss, sorry, boss. But we just caught the girl. Caught the girl? What do you mean? She got away. Joe let her out. But we caught her. Benny's got her now. Oh, yeah? Hold it on a minute. - Herman. - Yes, boss. You got anything to keep that dame from screaming? She couldn't scream if she was chlorophormed. - Oh, yeah? Do you got any? - Sure. But you got to be careful with that stuff. Too much and she'll never scream again. We'll take that chance. Listen, Cossack, tell Rocco to be ready but not to move until I get there. I'm on my way now. Yeah. Toby, I got you into all this. Wally, anyway, we're together. What are you staring at? Hm? I said what are you staring at. Those telephone wires. Now let's see. Before the telephone there was the telegraph. Telegraph, Morse code... Morse code. Wally, are you just playing with those wires or do you think you know what you're doing? I did it in a novel once. Oh... that's no good. Oh, if there were only something around here that I could use. - For a hook-up. - Hook-up? Yes, hook-up. Say, that makes me think. The radio! You can't talk to a radio. You can't even signal it. No, but I can try anyway. Bring me those telephone wires. - Will they reach? - Yes, I think so. Good. Maybe we got time to save Barfuss after all. Yes, how about us? Don't worry, I believe that this thing is going to work. I'm a dumbbell not to have thought of this before. If it's so bright, why didn't you think of it before? Well, why didn't I sell my stocks? Now, that's right. Now, we ought to hear "Number, please" in a minute. You've got something. Hello, operator? Can you hear me? Operator! - Can you hear me? - Shh! - Oh! - Isn't it doing anything more? No! Oh, give me a good swift kick! I didn't know I could be such an idiot. I might have had sense enough to know that... ...voices are to weak to register through the speaker alone. They have to go through the set. Now, first of all, I'm going to try and signal the operator and see if we can hear her. Now, that means hooking the speaker wires to the detector tube. Now, these wires go to the speaker binding post. Something certainly ought to happen then shouldn't it? Well, if it doesn't, I'll know that this set wasn't built right. There, now that's got to do the trick or we're... or we're out of luck. Now. It's perfectly dead. And time is going. Oh, Wally, if Dillon should come back and find you fooling with this thing. I'm doing my best, dear. There must be some defect in the amplifier. How would it be if you turned it on? I did. Well. It's a washout. "Number, please." It works, what did I tell you? - It works! - "Number, please!" Answer it, oh answer! I'm going to. First of all, I have to change the position of these wires, otherwise you can't talk out. You see, we have to be hooked up one way for us to hear her... ...and another for her to hear us. Come here, you have to help me. Look. That's the detector tube and those are the speaker binding posts. Now, these speaker wires go to the prongs of the detector tube... ...so she can speak to us in those positions after you reverse, do you understand? No, but I'm trying to. Okay, you handle the tube connections, I'll handle the others. - I hope I get this right. - You will, just keep cool. There's no hurry. Now I'm going to try and talk to the operator. Connect your wires to those prongs, just touching them will be enough. I've done that, they're touching. Now it'll take a second to get her attention. Hello, operator? Listen carefully. I am being held prisoner by a gang of gunmen. They have taken out the telephone to keep me from calling for help. I have connected up a radio set to the phone wires in an attempt to reach you. You've answered my flash just now and I heard you perfectly. Now I want to see if you can hear me. Don't answer yet. I have to switch my wires so that you can speak to us. Now I am going to switch, wait. Toby, you know what to do. Listen, you. Who do you think you're kidding? But Wally, she heard you! Switch, Toby. Operator, I'm not playing a joke, you must believe me. It's not only my life, but two others are in danger. And whether they're saved or not depends on you. Now wait for my flash and tell me that you understand! Switch, Toby! You're just pickled. Take another one for me, I'm busy. Switch, Toby! Operator, connect me with the supervisor or the police, but for heaven's sake don't waste any time about it. Toby, you speak to her. - Please, oh please, operator, help us! - And every minute counts. Switch, Toby. All right, I'll take a chance. What's it all about? Switch, Toby. First of all, you'd better make a note of this. Hey, what are you doing with that radio? We can't go on for a minute, Toby. I was just fastening these wires so we can get going again presently. This thing just went on the fritz. I was just trying to fix it. You're trying to wreck it. What do you know about radios? Oh, more than you think. - Just an expert. - That's right. Anything we can do for you, Joe? No, I just dropped in to see how you was. I'll park over here for a while. Well, that makes it perfect. Joe, I wonder, would you be enough to get me a screwdriver? I'm staying right here. You ain't gonna make a dummy out of me again. - Are those your orders? - Yep. The boss is on his way here now. On his way here? And I'm staying till he comes. Well, that settles that. Yes, indeed, we're right up against it, Joe. And... I was just saying to Mr. Porter a little while ago, It's too bad we can't call out for help... ...by giving a message to the police over this old radio. Ain't it? But that's something nobody's got on to yet. No, but if it could be done, all I'd have to do... ...would be to speak right into the speaker like this, wouldn't it, Wally? Yeah, but all you'd do would be to yell for help. I would not. I'd begin by saying, This is Toby. H. Van Buren speaking and if you've read the papers, you'd know that I have been missing the past two days with Wallace Porter. We are being held here by Jake Dillon and his gang. And you wouldn't forget to tell them where you are. I don't know exactly... It's inspired in Granville. Sure, it's the old Granville place off Riverdale Ave. at the very end of Oak Lane. Isn't that right, Joe? You know enough already without me telling you. Sure! You got the address right, there are four or five armed men here and the police had better come in for us. - I think a dozen cops would be enough. - Yes, just about... Wouldn't it be hot if you could do it? So that's what you'd do, eh? Now I'll show you what I'd do. You know how those radio announcers put on the dog, Joe? - They make you sick. - Yeah, wouldn't it? This is Wallace Porter speaking. That's hot. Within the hour Otto Barfuss will be murdered unless he is warned in time. He is now travelling on the New York Central Express for Buffalo... Train number 81, car 63, lower berth 8. Get in touch with the New York Central train dispatcher. What do you think you're doing? I'm giving a swell imitation of a broadcaster. - Well, I don't like it. - Well then, how do you like this one? Find out where train number 81 is and get Barfuss off that train. Come away from that thing. - How do I know what you two are up to? - Send the police up here in a hurry. You too! And I'm telling you, if that thing would work and the cops would find this hangout, they'd get their bellies full. "Hello, Mr. Porter." - You little outbreaker! - Joe, he was only kidding! - Well, that thing talked, didn't it? - Oh, it talked, but it didn't really talk. Look, Joe, look, you see... these are the wires and... - Shall I hit him again? - Hey, Joe! Hey, where's Joe? Joe? Oh, he went... out. - Oh. - "Hello?" What's that? - Hello? - Huh? I just said hello. Oh, hello. Hello. Oh, shut up! Switch, Toby. Hello, operator. We can talk now. Switch, Toby. Mr. Porter, will you please repeat Mr. Barfuss' reservation number? Switch, Toby. Hello? Train number 81, car 63, lower berth 8. What are we stopping here for? Oh... this is an express train. They stop everywhere. - What are you looking at? - Oh, nothing. Paging Mr. Barfuss. Mr. Barfuss. Yes... Here, I'm Mr. Barfuss, what is it? You're wanted on the phone. - Phone on the train? - No, sir. You'll have to hurry, Mr. Barfuss, I'm holding the train. Well, can't I wait and clean my... Oh, alright, alright. What is it? - Coming. - Coming! He's coming. Hello, Mr. Porter, we've done everything. They stopped Mr. Barfuss' train. Wally! I just talked to Yonkers Police Headquarters, Mr. Porter. They're sending a motorcycle squad. Joe, it won't do you any good to kill us. But you can save your own life. You just got time to round up your gang and make your getaway. Oh, there you are, bright boy. - But, uh... - Shut up! Do I have to stay here to keep you halfwits on your toes? What kind of dopes are you anyway to let a thing like that happen? Well, I'll fix you! Where's that Joe? - Listen, boss... - Ah, shut up, it's all your fault! Didn't I tell you not to leave anybody out of here? - I didn't... - No, but you let her out... ...and if it wasn't for Benny, this place would be in the hands of the cops right now. - The cops... - Shut up and get out of here! But boss... Oh, Hilda! Hilda! Hilda, I'm taking these two out of here, a way out. If ever anybody comes here and asks for them, you never saw them, never even heard of them before. As soon as they're gone, you pick up some rags and furniture polish... ...and you go over every stick of furniture in the room. Clean up the whole place. You can go back to bed now, Joe will lock up. Joe. Joe, where are you? - What do you know about that? - About what? You heard me, every car going out of the garage, mine too. What's been going on here? Come on, you know something about it. Spit it out! "Hello, Mr. Porter." "Hello, Mr. Porter. Have the police got there?" What's that? The train's been stopped, here's Mr. Barfuss. Why, you! Come on... stick 'em up! Hold still! Hurry, you and Red cover the back of the house. Come on with me, fellows. What's going on here? - Daddy! - Toby! Are you all right? - Sure she's all right, I'm here. - I said what's going on here? What's going on here? I just captured the biggest gangster in New York. And if I don't get another watch for this, I'm Wallace Porter, keep that guy covered. What have you been doing to my daughter? - Practically everything! - Wh... - And if you don't let me marry him now... - I didn't say I wouldn't. - Take him out! - Come on, you. - "Hello, Mr, Porter". - Coming! Mr. Porter, here's Mr. Barfuss ready to speak. - "The train must leave!" - Now, look here! Shh! Mr. Barfuss, it's a matter of life and death. Don't brush your teeth this morning. All right. All right, I... I... I won't even take them out. - Are you hurt? - No. - Yes. - Here! Well... Crime. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
