A TOEl / RISING Production TOEl Presents "THE GEISHA HOUSE" 1958. The Anti-Prostitution Act was about to be enforced. "Stop Prostitution!" "Liberate Women!" Kimiryo. Who? It's me, Tokiko. Wait. What is it? Ajob. Go to the Iwako. Don't say I was here. Everybody knows you're here. Be sure to go. Leaving so soon? Sorry, Executive. I'll miss you. Nonsense. You can't leave me. I'm back. I never thought you'd want to leave me. Don't be angry. Listen. You've been cheating me for ten years. Don't say I'm cheating you. My son understands, but not my daughter. She sides with her mother. She's old enough to argue. Then I'll see her. I'll tell her everything so she'll understand. Try to understand. It's not goodbye forever. Just pretend we're through. I don't like pretense. You know my character. Mr. Yoshikawa. Give me supper. I'll eat here. Why don't you eat here? I'm leaving. Don't be hasty. Let's settle the matter first. What's your hurry? Give me a drink. There's a bottle of Hennessy in the cupboard. That's fine. Fujinoya Geisha House. You want me? Right now? Good evening. "Michiko's" Hello. You want me, Terucho? You were walking fast along the river. Where to? An errand. I asked where you went. Terucho, cut it out. What for? Many things. Tell me! What do you want to know? Tokiko's embarrassed. The Momoyama Hotel? I know who was there. A big man and Kimiryo, in bed. I don't know. A good answer. You don't know anything. She stole him from me. I'll make her pay for it. That's enough. Go home. Excuse me. Hello. Business is good upstairs. I don't like it, but I need money. How many girls? Only three. They don't make much money. The law can't stop prostitution. We're geisha. We're no match for those whores. I'm drunk. Very good. Good morning. Goodbye. Good morning, Madam. I'm back, Madam. Terucho. Kimiryo. Madam got up. Wake up! It's nine-thirty. Thanks. I'm coming. I won't eat. Good morning, Madam. Morning. Good morning, Madam. Morning. Good morning, Madam. What's the dress for? I'm going to Takarazuka. The all-girls revue? Who likes that? Golf. Who's taking you? A professor. What happened to your painter? I'm through with him. Do you know what they call you? "A collector of cheap artists." Not this time. He's a professor. They're poor, anyway. I'll eat, too. Go on. When you climb the stairs, step softly. I'm sorry. You shake the house like an earthquake. I'm sorry. When did you return last night? Let me see, about 2 o'clock. Today's geisha aren't well disciplined like they used to be. It's business to drink with your customers at a party. But you mustn't get drunk. You disciplined us well enough, so I understand. But I had something to drown in alcohol. The party was over at eleven. You shouldn't have been loafing around. I'm sorry. Forgive me. But someone went to a cheap hotel and acted like a call girl. Is that good as a geisha? Who did that? Who could that be? She might be around here. Here? Where? Well... You can guess. This isn't a quiz show. Mention my name. Did she mean you? Did you do that? I don't think she's a slut like that. What? What about you? You flirt with a bald guy and a fatso. You sleep with any man. It's only natural Mr. Kayama left you. The taxi company director? Yes. He wants to sleep with every geisha here. Damn thief! What are we? Friends! How could you grab my lover, of all people! Nymphomaniac! Stop it! Somemaru, stop them! I'll splash water on you! Get a bucket! Stop! I'll go to a bathhouse. Come on! I'll quit being a geisha. I'll go away. I can find you an apartment. How stupid! You can go away, if you like. But... Do you know how much you owe me? I'll go to play golf. I'll go to the bath, too. Don't fight in the bathhouse. I understand. Geisha's battleground is a party. I'll beat her. Don't sit there with a bucket, like a fool. You have a nice car. My buddy's car. Not yours? How can a schoolteacher afford it? Not a professor? Not much difference. But you're a playboy. My dad is supporting me. So he's rich. Let's forget golf and go to a hotel. I'm expensive. Okay? I'd like to give you all my money. Fine! I'd like to give you myself, too. Good! No more golfing! Watch out! Welcome. I see. I'm ready. She's here. I understand. Madam called me just now. Sit and wait. Protect human rights of women! We want the Anti-Prostitution Act right now! Licensed prostitution must end! Please cooperate! Come. Thank you. Goodbye. She's from the geisha house. No. From a restaurant. You paid from your pocket. No secrets from me. Don't tell your mom. She's coming. Where's the kimono designed by the artist? Artist? Don't tell me you don't know. The blue one. Oh, that. Otowa's wife bought it. I wanted to wear it for the next tea party. If it isn't Tokiko! Been a long time! You're pretty. You a maiko? If you are, I'll call you to my party. What about the Anti-Prostitution Act? I read the paper. I'm busy. Goodbye. I'm back. I'm unfortunate. Maybe it's written. I'm sick of living. Welcome. I got it. Thanks. You fall for a man too easily. Your patron failed in his business. Goodbye money, goodbye love. Not so simple. We have a child. You're merely a concubine. Not a legal wife. He makes love to you and pays for it. That's what you are. Realize it. Your man lost his money. Say sympathetically, "I'm sorry." That's all. But we aren't beasts. We love each other. I can't be so cold. What about you? Mr. Yoshikawa takes care of you for ten years. He doesn't. I take care of him. But he gives you a lot of money every month. Naturally. I give him myself free of charge. Please lend me 100,000 yen. You'd better not. Giving him money is like throwing it in a ditch. He said he'd come back a big businessman. How much will he need to make his new company? 18,000,000 yen. His old factory was sold at 8,000,000 yen. He needs ten million more. Your 100,000 yen would mean nothing. I borrowed 500,000 on my shop. Stupid! You're a helpless fool! Even if I'm a fool, I want to give him everything. Fujinoya Geisha House. Thank you. Sumida wants Kimiryo at a 3 o'clock party. All right. Kimiryo. Wear this kimono today. Thank you. Go to the bank and cash this check. Thank you very much. It's for 200,000 yen. Why don't you lend me 200,000? Don't push your luck. It's not easy money. I wouldn't lend it to anybody else. We were pals, so it's a special case. Understand? It's a big favour. I'll collect my 100,000 at the bank. She'll be back soon. I can't wait. You might change your mind. Thanks. Tokiko! She'll lend me 100,000. Give it to me. No. Get it from her. She said okay. Don't worry. But I'm on an errand. Get it from her. You got me. I know you're right. Let's do so. I'm sorry. I was wrong. My dear. Be patient. You'll be a fine maiko. "Hinod Taxi on a Strike!" "More wages! Less working hours!" I'll be going. Good luck. Tokiko. Any message with the check? No. Like he'll come tonight? No. I'll go to the theatre this evening. Fujinoya Geisha House. Yes. Thank you. What's Terucho doing? She went to a singing lesson. It can't be this long. She's flirting again. I'm back. A long lesson! Go to a party at the Matsumura. You know the pinball joint near the theatre? You can win easily there. Thanks. Have the restaurant deliver a steak. I'll take a shower. This is Fujinoya. Deliver us a steak. Bring it by three. Hello. Mr. Kosaka. Madam? Showering. Tokiko, you're a big girl now. Come in. Terucho, I have a new kimono for you. Find me a patron who'll pay for it. You already have three patrons. I want two more. Mr. Kosaka. My sash? I brought it. Take a look. It's beautiful and elegant. Look. Wonderful! I'll wear it to the theatre. Great! It's expensive. Pay half today. No money. Oh, no! My master ordered me to get paid. Get the new kimono designed by the artist. The blue one? A kimono dealer depends on geisha. How many kimono have we bought? Tokiko will be a geisha soon. Then we'll buy more from you. A stingy man can't be a good merchant. This helps me a lot. I'll double it to pay back. Why don't you have a drink? I'm busy. Thanks for the call. Let's drink next time. Then see your son, at least. How is he? Ichiro! What are you doing? Drawing. Good boy. Dad wants to see you. Come here. See your dad. Big boy! Heavy, too. How old? I told you. He just started grade school. Of course. It slipped my mind. I'll come again. Study hard. Ask him to come again. Come again! We'll be waiting. We'll be waiting. Hello. Tokiko. Madam sent me here for your I.O.U. Naturally I must write it. Wait a minute. Don't fall in love. Good evening. Hello. Welcome, Terucho! Am I late? Have a drink. Thank you. Do I know you guys? I'm Yoshikawa's son. Yoshikawa? The old man who often goes to your house. Oh, the patron! Yeah, the patron's son. Hello. I'm pleased to meet you. I wanted to see the thing called geisha that Dad so blindly loves. We're human beings. We have no tails, as you see. I heard geisha are beautiful and have Japanese emotion. Examine me closely. It won't hurt. Madam has been Dad's concubine for ten years. My sister's classmate told me his secret affairs. His mom is the heiress. She has clout. So he's in a spot. Mom is so angry she wants a divorce. Still jealous at 46. Madam knows where she stands. She has no ambition, so she won't harm his wife. Mom is morally against concubines. A man who can't afford a concubine is useless. You approve? Tell me... Whatever you are, what will you be in the future? A good concubine. Morality in Japan says a man should be true to his wife. To love another woman is immoral. They only say so. The truth lies behind them. Even if it's true, Dad's in a tight spot. What do you think he should do? Your mother found the truth. Ask her to be generous. Because your father must keep taking care of his concubine. You're siding with her. Of course. She's a very nice woman. Why else would your father love her for ten years? He's captivated by her charm. The trouble is, he pays her 200,000 yen a month. If he cherishes money more than a woman, he can't love her. Well said. A fine remark. He's a nice boy. He'll graduate from college next year. Strange. Why did he want to see you? That's the point. His mother sent him to investigate. He's on our side. He seemed to understand. His strategy. Maybe you should seduce him, too. Don't be silly! May I seduce him, then? You want to seduce any man. That's a disease. Yeah. I'm a born nymph. What? What? Stop! A noodle vendor! Get me a bowl. Me, too. Get six bowls. I'll buy them. Thank you. Give me six. It's a warning, Madam. His wife might lock him in. She's the heiress. Did he pay you this month? He did today. Geisha are different from barmaids. They have delicacy. I understand why you kept one for your concubine. Naturally. Women must be tender. Delicacy matters. But fear my mom. Tough luck. Hi, Dad! Tokiko! What brought you here? It's a holiday. I'm free today. You surprised me. I was afraid you got in trouble or something. Welcome back. Madam gave me some sushi for my family. She's always generous. Is it your holiday, too? She's skipping school these days. Why? We're busy. We need her help. Making her work for you? You admit it? But your dad is sick and can't work hard. And Sadao's back. Brother? He lost his job. We can't make a living unless Fujiko works. You have Sadao to work for you. He's changed. His hope and guts are gone with his firm. He does nothing, says nothing. You send 1,000 yen every month. It helps us a lot. I'll send 500 yen more. Let Fujiko go to school. Junior high school is compulsory. It's your duty to send her to school. She mustn't be like me. I'm sorry. We're disqualified. When you're a maiko, I'll weave you a nice sash. Forget it and think of Fujiko. He's one of the best weavers around here, but... He's sick. My teacher said Dad could be a national treasure. Even if so, we live from hand to mouth. I'm back. Your sister's back. How are you? Fine. Any gift? She brought some sushi. Let's eat it. Come, everybody. Delicious. Good sushi. Good! The last one. Sadao. Tokiko's back on leave. You missed the sushi she brought. Hi, Brother! Hello. Your firm? Bankrupt. What'll you do? To make a living. Que sera sera. Are you drunk? My friend gave me beer. Why bankrupt? You got a big bonus last year. Blame our parent company. They cut back their business. We suppliers lost jobs. All went bankrupt. Why not find anotherjob? It's not easy. Rich people scatter money in your world. Maybe you know some big shots. You can ask them to hire me. I work in the kitchen all day. I've never seen big shots. You get drunk and complain. How can you find ajob? What about you? You live in a feudalistic world of prostitution. The likes of you are our enemy. Stupid! You'll never know how hard she works to send us money. 1,000 yen every month! So she's toiling? What for? To become a maiko to please rich baboons? Stop, idiot! Hello. Yamashita. My sister said you're back. It's been a long time. I hear you work in Osaka. It's a holiday. Working at a sawmill? Tough work. I cut timber and lumber all day. Sawdust almost suffocates me. It tickles me at night. It took weeks to get used to it. How many seniors? Five. They work hard. Holidays? One a week. That's nice. I have no regular holidays. You'll be a pretty maiko. Let's eat rice cake. Yes, let's. Will you own a sawmill someday? I doubt it. It'd cost millions to build one. I'll never be able to own one. What will you do? My master takes care of me. He says he'll teach me how to operate machines and vehicles. I'll work for him till I'm ready to go independent. You're honest and diligent. You'll make it someday. I hope you will. Good evening. Hello. Are you alone tonight? I suddenly wanted to see you. Thanks. How pretty! I'm glad to be here. You know how to please me. Happy people! Let's have fun. Why not? Come on, have a drink! Thanks. Terucho in? What? You surprised me. I want Terucho. What did she do? You planned it! Don't yell at me. Why? Wake up, Terucho. She's a devil. I don't understand. Why? You really don't know? I said no. What is it? She seduced my son. He's a student. Why corrupt an innocent boy? Are you sure? You planned it! You want to ruin my family! What's the good of ruining your family? I did everything I could do for you. I've taken care of you for ten years. Is this your thanks? I gave you a monthly allowance of 200,000 yen. 200,000 since last summer. It was 100,000 before. 1,200,000 a year. 10,800,000 for 9 years. Plus 2,400,000. 13,200,000 in total. You calculate quickly. Why not? I'm a good merchant. If you talk of money, I will, too. I sold my ten years for 13,200,000 yen. A bargain. So it was fair business. We're even. I thought better of you. I thought better of you. Where's Terucho? In bed. Wake her. I'm awake. Good morning. What did you do with my son? He made love to me. Why did you seduce him? I didn't. He seduced me. He's an innocent student. Engaged, too. You're a slut. It's clear who seduced whom. You can't tell what happens between a boy and a girl. Like father, like son. He's good at making love. He caressed me all night. He licked me all over my body. I entertain customers. Sometimes I make love for money. But I'm a human being. We're equal. Why did you hit me? We're through! Parting is simple. I bought this house. It belongs to me. Understand? Purify the entrance. I'm sorry, Madam. It's destined to come. What a stingy swine! Kick him out. He doesn't deserve you. What happened? He called me out to a restaurant. He said he fell in love with me. I was afraid it was a trick. But it wasn't his mother's idea. I thought he could help you. So I... I slept with him. But he surprised me. He was a technician. How could his father know? Did he tell his dad? No, not between father and son. Strange. I toId him. Why? It was my strategy. To make him consider that you seduced me. He might think Madam pIanned it. He'd storm into her pIace and say they'd be through. You're smart. And I had sweet memories of you. You used me. You don't know anything, so forget it. You Iook bright and carefree. You think you're smart. But you don't understand. We're human beings, too. You're Iearned. You're promising. Get promoted. You're Iucky. Goodbye. Wait, Terucho! Ass! No! Stop! It's a IittIe act of fiIiaI piety. Sex and fiIiaI piety? Two birds with one stone. Make way for me! Hey, punk! I sued you for rape. Rape? You raped me by force. Don't make me Iaugh. Laugh, if you can. You'II be summoned to court. No! He's engaged! What a pity! What's going on? She seduced our son. Not onIy him. His dad made Iove to me, too. Father! You ruined our reputation! No! She's a Iiar. They caII it an orgy. Let's meet in court. Goodbye. Thanks. Thanks a Iot. Sato! What is it? My man is gone! I'm sorry. He stopped coming, so I went to his house. His neighbour said he went to his hometown Iast week. Where? I don't know. Having been his concubine for 15 years, you don't know? Why didn't he teII me? He took my 100,000 yen and the 500,000 yen you borrowed? Yes. What happened to his new company? It's not that he'II return home as a success. He'II feeI smaII. So I toId you to be carefuI. Not to depend on him. I'm a fooI. HopeIessIy stupid, If you regret it, you shouIdn't have become a geisha.. You stoIe him from his famiIy. Be ready for punishment. Bring brandy. Hennessy. Let's have a drink. You're fortunate. If he hadn't Ieft you, you'd have Iost everything, money and aII. Buck up! Tears won't heIp. Somemaru, open up! It's me! Somemaru! Morning aIready? Wake up! Somemaru! Wake up! It's me! Open up! Quiet! It's Iate! So what? Open the door! Wake up, you whore! I'II caII the poIice! PoIice? I'm sorry. Excuse me. Tokiko is her name? Yes. How Iong? Four years. I hear she's a good dancer. Yes. She's taIented. She trains hard. When'II be her debut? Anytime. I'm waiting for the chance. It'II cost a Iot to make a debut as a maiko. Kimono and parties... 5 miIIion yen in aII. ExactIy. Let me heIp you. ReaIIy? Thank you. May I choose her first man? Yes, of course. Mr. Tamura wiII be her sponsor. The Tamura? No? AII right. He'II pay 3 miIIion yen. Thank you. We'II share it fifty-fifty. Agreed? Agreed. The sponsor wiII take her twice. Let's find her patron Iater. Yes, thank you. Let's hoId a big party for her debut. Thank you. Hanaman was impressed. She offered to heIp you. You're going to make your debut. It'II cost 5,000,000 yen to make you a maiko. 3,000,000 for your costume. 2,000,000 for your party. We aren't rich. It's not easy to raise the money. I'm sorry. To become a maiko means to become a woman. To Iose your virginity. Your sponsor wiII sIeep with you and make you a woman. I understand. I'm gIad you do. Thanks. That's the ruIe. You can't Iive here negIecting the ruIe. Your party wiII be the 21st of next month. So practice dancing tiII then. CongratuIations! Thank you. Mr. Tamura wiII break her cherry. That rich Ioser? Is his Iegend true? Yes. It was Iong ago, but I stiII remember. Each time he Iost his Iove, he presented a big fish to every geisha house around here. The good oId days. No one Iike him now. He has acres of cedar forests. He's so rich he never counts coins. He can Iay aII the girIs here with his money. He's 78. He's oId now. He stiII wants to break a maiko's cherry. Poor Tokiko! Someone must do it. Maybe an oId man is better. He'II treat her kindIy. Hanaman backs her. She'II have good patrons. She's Iucky. Madam needs a Iot of money for Tokiko, but she Iost her patron. She's having a hard time. She's through with him? We can't depend on our patrons, after aII. Yours ran away, too. HeIIo. Somemaru, you got a job. Did you overhear us? Of course not. PoIice. Let us Iook at your room upstairs. Why? Someone caIIed us. He said you're running a whorehouse. It's against the Iaw. Excuse me. The cops have come. Go to the roof and get dressed. Let us check. Don't worry. If you disagree, I'II ask another deaIer. It's not that, but... I know we haven't paid aII our biIIs. So I think I must order her kimono from you. Once she becomes a geisha, she'II need many a kimono. And she'II buy them from you. Like our other girIs. They owe us 8,000,000 yen. I know. You're an empIoyee. I understand your anxiety. I run a geisha house. My credit stiII stands. You'II get paid in the end. Don't worry. You probabIy know... Mr. Yoshikawa... He waIked out on me. I'm through with him. I need heIp. I'm not a woman who forgets favours. Someday I'II reciprocate your kindness. WeIcome. WiII you be a maiko? Yes. So heIp me. Leave it there. She's nice. She'II be a star. NaturaIIy. InstaIments for a year. No! Your shop is one of her sponsors. How many kimono wiII she buy for five, ten years? Your taxi company is on a strike. Aren't you busy? It was settIed Iong ago. I sent some geisha to the union Ieaders' beds, and settIed it. Men are heIpIessIy devoted to sex. Even a 78 year oId man wants to break a geisha's cherry. ShouId we praise him or despise him? You shouId praise him. Thanks to those stupid men, we can keep our job. What do you think about chastity? We have nothing Iike that. We're free peopIe. We have our own moraIs. Your own moraIs? Like what? Howto handIe men. With chastity, we can't do anything. Try to handIe me. First, Terucho. Next, Kimiryo. I come in third? The Iast. No more girIs. WiII you pay a Iot? Don't mix money with Iove. Money is the core of our moraIs. How much? 50,000 yen? 50,000? Me? My body? Quiet! They'II hear you. Let them hear us! You bid so IittIe for my body! If you're a man, say 3,000,000 Iike the rich oId man! Even 50,000 is too much for a sIut. You can't Iay a girI without money. Get out! Go home and count coins! See? This is our new set of moraIs. Goodbye! WeIcome. Somemaru in? No, she's not in. Liar! Bring her here. Whatever you want, she's out. Who are you? I Iive here. A wouId-be geisha? You can Ieave a message for her. WouId-be! Listen. Listen to me! You too are going to cheat men with your Iies. This is a den of vixens. How many vixens Iive here? If you have no message, go home. Somemaru! Come out! Be quiet! We're not in a forest. Lower your voice. Vixen! Somemaru squeezed my money. She can't get away with it! Poor guy! She shook you off? You're scum! The Anti-Prostitution Act wiII finish you. What are you to make Iove to scum? You teach psychoIogy. But you'II never understand our psychoIogy. Very funny! Your psychoIogy? What is it? Cheat before being cheated. That's a geisha's way. One more thing. Goodbye money, goodbye Iove. You can hear it in a drama. Finance of 1,000,000 yen is easy for you to get. It's not easy. You have Yoshikawa for your patron. I'm through with him. ReaIIy? Through with him? He was my rivaI in Iove. Now you ask me for money. AII right. I'II finance you. But I'm a moneyIender. I want something. Name your interest. No interest. I Iost my Iove before. I want to get it back. I want your body. I know I'm wretched. You can refuse. Maybe it's better that way. It's a deaI. I didn't expect it. But you can't have me in this restaurant. Take me to a hoteI. Stop at the corner, pIease. WeIcome home. I'm back. WouId you Iike to take a bath? You prepared it? Tokiko. I'd Iike to eat something. Other girIs? Gone to bed. Go home before you become a maiko. No. Spend a night with your mother and father. No. You sure? If you don't want to. Go somewhere eIse and enjoy yourseIf. Do so. Tokiko. It's Iate. Do it tomorrow. Come here. You Iet me decide everything about your future, but... If you don't Iike it, say so. What do you think as you watch our Iife? Nothing particuIar. The Anti-Prostitution Act wiII be enforced. Be honest with me. Aren't you reIuctant to be a maiko? I want to be a maiko, then a geisha, quickIy. I want to make money. What for? My famiIy is poor. I want to heIp them Iive weII. What I cherish is... Money. I'II do anything for money. I... I'm gIad you'II make me a maiko. I'm gratefuI. I don't know what you reaIIy feeI, but... I'II take your word for it. HonestIy speaking... I need 1,000,000 yen to make you a maiko. I got finance. Not without a sacrifice. But now I think it wasn't wasted. After you become a maiko, then a geisha, things wiII happen. Be sure to keep your mind strong. Don't yieId to your ego. WeII done. You're a good dancer now. Listen. Tokiko is going to be a maiko. CongratuIate her. CongratuIations! Thank you. We'II hoId a party for Tokiko tonight. It's okay, but don't skip your job. We'II cut it short. It's the same. AII right. Make it a big party. Thank you. Omocha means a toy. Who named you that? Hanaman. We're expensive Iiving toys for gentIemen. Omocha, he's 78 years oId. Treat him gentIy. Don't worry. Madam taught you. Right? Yes. Time fIies. We were Iike her once. My first man was a famous priest. He was impotent. What a racket! Let us join you. Omocha's starting a new Iife. As our senior, teII her about your first man. Oh, no. It's an oId story. Let's ceIebrate her. Hear her determination. TeII it to us. My determination is... Come on! ''Going my way.'' WeII said! Let's have fun. Cheers! How do you write a letter ''A?'' Write this way and that way. How do you write a letter ''K?'' Write this way and that way. ''Omocha'' I'm going to introduce myseIf. Good. Good Iuck. Thank you. Thank you aII. You're pretty. CongratuIations! Good Iuck! Thank you. Thank you. WeIcome. This is Omocha, the new maiko. CongratuIations! PIease come in. Omocha. She Iooks very nice. Thank you. PIease be nice to me. Mr. Tamura is waiting. Let us in. I'm sorry we're Iate. This is Omocha. How do you do, sir. Come over here. Thank you. I have expensive incense. Try. Excuse me. Thank you. As usuaI, your incense is superb. Name? ''Summer Water.'' PreciseIy! Why don't you try? What? Incense. You watched me. HoId it this way. And smeII it. Excuse me. Thank you. Good. How do you Iike it? It reminds me of the sound of my father's Ioom. Sound of a Ioom? Poetic. To us kids, it indicated poverty and IoneIiness. Is that so? TeII me your name again. Omocha, sir. Yes, Omocha. Good name.
