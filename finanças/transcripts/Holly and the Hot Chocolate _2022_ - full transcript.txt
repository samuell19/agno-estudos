Good morning, Pine Falls. It's December 1st, and that means crack open the attic and dig out the garland. It's officially Christmas. Beautiful, yeah? I don't know about you, but after I decorated my house, I'm heading down to Town Square to snag a cup of the best hot chocolate on earth. See you in line, Pine Falls. Hey, darling. Morning, Dad. What? Merry Christmas! It's December 1st, Stephanie. Okay, well, that's technically Christmas. And I know you like hate Christmas or whatever. I don't sound like that. But I'm going to be at a dorm next year, so I thought I would, like, decorate the whole place, and you're just going to love it. Hmm, you taking bets on that? Look, I know I ask this, like, every year, but... Nope. Please. Look, I promise I'll take care of it. No. And I'll clean up after it, and I'll make sure it... Forget it. You're not getting a real Christmas tree. Rock, paper, scissors. And if I win, I get a real Christmas tree. Best of one? Okay. God, do you think I want to do this? You think I want to beat my daughter that badly every time. Yeah, I miss Mom, too, you know. But I think she would want us to decorate for Christmas. I'd give anything to know what Mom wanted right now. All right, you can get a tree. Yeah? Yay! Not before December 15th. How about the 5th? 15th! Anything before that is nuts. Merry Christmas. Coming through? Lady with a baby. Merry Christmas. Sorry. Merry Christmas. Holly. Mrs. Marcus. As of last weekend, it's Ms. Marcus. Oh, good for you. Good for my salsa instructor. Okay. Holly, could you turn your sweater off for a minute, please? Oh. No, still not. It's not working. Just forget it. I read your review about the cheese fries for McKeever's Tavern. Oh, yeah, they're amazing. You have to try them. Holly, at Effie magazine, we strive to be on the cutting edge of culinary experience. We don't review cheese fries. Well, yeah, I know we generally review the higher end stuff, but my social media following loves when I review the sort of everyday comfort foods, you know, local businesses and all. Our customers don't like everyday foods. They like elite, the seemingly unattainable. With all due respect to Mrs. Marcus. Ms. Marcus. Wouldn't you agree that just because something's fancy doesn't mean that it's necessarily good? To our subscribers, that's exactly what that means. What are you doing tomorrow? Oh, I have the day off, remember? I'm going to Boston. But first, I'm going to have you review Chef Peter Lou's new brunch restaurant downtown. Oh, okay. What's in Boston? I'm visiting Tommy. I'm meeting his parents. Ah, yes. And how is Tommy? He's good. He's good? You had nicer things to say about the cheese fries. ♪ Whoo! ♪ ♪ Blue eyes, don't you make my heart surrender ♪ ♪ Just a victim of everything that you do ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ Merry Christmas! Thank you. Hey. Merry Christmas! Yep. Merry Christmas! Yeah. Merry Christmas! Okay. Merry Christmas! Good. Merry Christmas! ♪ You're the best around ♪ ♪ The best around ♪ ♪ The best around ♪ ♪ The best around ♪ A little more. A little more. A little more. Hey, Sheryl, let's try more, and then go a little more when more is too much, 'cause, you know... I can't wait for tonight. I've been thinking about that hot chocolate for 11 months. I mean, me too. Rudy, are you excited about the hot chocolate too? Rudy doesn't like hot chocolate. Steve. Rudy, can you please just say Mayor Hanks? I'm performing an official duty. I will never call you Mayor Hanks, and look, it's not that I hate the hot chocolate. I just, the line's always massive, and I'm just, I'm not waiting in line for anything anymore. But that's my favorite part, the anticipation and the music and the people. And this year, maybe, some snow. I bought a snow machine. You got a snow machine with taxpayer money? Oh. Don't say it like that. That makes it so... This is exciting. I want this town to have a white Christmas. It gets everybody in the spirit, and you can use a little Christmas spirit yourself, Rudy. I bet it's because he misses his wife, Nora, you think that's it? I bet that's it. Of course that's it. Rudy, sweetheart, there are a lot of fish in the sea, and the only way to catch one is to keep your rod in the water. Sheryl, do you have any idea what you just said? Yeah, that came out weird, Sheryl. Gosh, that's not what I meant. Hey. Hey, babe. Hi. What's up, too? Trying to get the place ready for the weekend. I'm pretty busy. Now I'm on the phone. Well, I'm excited to meet your family. Oh, yeah, look. My parents, they're not really into Christmas, so try not to talk about it too much, and maybe not wear so much Christmas gear. Okay, got it. Don't be in a good mood. No. Look, I'm sorry I'm being tense. I just didn't get to work out today, and the lady at the coffee shop said I look 45. You're 43. She was close. It was insensitive. And then I'm the one that gets asked to leave because I'm being too emotional. Well, I'm sorry. I think you look 35. I think you look 35, too, babe. I am 35. Okay. You hang up first. Okay. Well, I can't wait to see you. Remember to bring that avocado dish. I already packed it. Okay, in bubble wrap, right? Yes. Okay, good, because I got it in Tijuana, Holly. It's my guac dish, Holly. I bubble wrapped it twice. I duct-taped it. It's got packing peanuts, Tommy. I'm not going back to Tijuana, Holly. I'm not even allowed. I'm staring at it, Tommy. It's wrapped. Can you take a picture of the dish for me? I... Yes, I'll send the picture. All right, all right. Look, I got to go. It's just stressing me out. Hey, still haven't gotten a pic of that dish. Mm-hmm. Okay. So this is our take on brunch. You see, we prefer a healthier version of the fluffy pancakes and greasy bacon. So here we have a charred and flattened piece of asparagus. Yeah. Mm, balsamic adds a nice note. Yeah. It's a little bit of sweet. Who put this on? I added it to the playlist. I thought people would like it. Nobody wants to hear Christmas music, Claire. Okay. Sorry. Turn it off. Totally. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. I hope you brought your appetite. I'm actually very hungry, so... Oh, well, guess what? Scrambled quail eggs with a question of chives. A question? Yes, you see, the flavor's so subtle that it's not really a hint of chives. It's more of a question of chives. Like, was that chives? And it is. It's not. It's scallions, which is fun, you know? So I'll let you have at it. Bay leaf. Very edible. Stand up straight. Stand up straight. Sorry, we're out of maple sausage. Oh, it's okay. I got some snacks in the truck. Thank you. What you looking at? Just sports stuff. Rudy. Rudy. Merry Christmas. Thanks, Dale. No. I said, Merry Christmas. Right. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Hello, everybody. Hello. Hey, man. How you doing? Good. Are you carrying these around so people know you're the mayor? No, you boob. Yeah, you are. I had a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new juice bar, and I parked like three blocks from here, and I didn't want to walk. Unbelievable. You love the power, don't you? You love it. I get asked to cut ribbons all the time. Banks, bakeries. I cut the ribbon at Dale's divorce settlement. It did add a bit of fun in the process. I don't know, man. I think you just want people to know you're the mayor. People would know I was the mayor without the scissors. Oh, yeah? Excuse me, miss. Do you know who this is? Yeah, you're the guy that used all the taxpayer dollars for your driveway, right? What? I don't even have a driveway. I just bought a townhome. Who paid for that? Oh, my God. Are you kidding? Everybody's saying it. This is the rumor going around. I better nip this in the bud. Let's talk about something else, because I do have very big news. Pine Falls is in the running for best Christmas town in the US. The winner is going to be featured on Mornings with America. Oh, boy, that is something. Oh, boy, it is something, Dale. Well, Merry Christmas, Steve. Merry Christmas, Dale, but also, that's the end of this. Rudy, this is a big deal. We get featured on national television. That's massive for tourism. So you got to vote online. Yeah, I totally will. I'd just love to see the other towns first. Are these vacation homes or real homes? Vacation homes are real homes, Steve. You're moving. Come on. What the heck are you doing that for? I'm not moving yet. Does Deb know? Does Deb know? Hey, stop putting those scissors at me, and no, my mother does not know yet. Okay? Hey, hey, Steve, stop running with fake scissors. These are real scissors, Rudy. Chef Peter Lou's new French restaurant is fantastic if you don't like eating food. Chef Peter Lou's new French restaurant is wonderful if you like portions the size of American change. Food that makes you feel like a tiny baby mouse. A question of chives. Love it, 10 out of 10. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleight. I wish there was another option, Deb. So, I want to get this right. I don't have any money. No. No, no, no. You owe a lot of money, more than you have, so no money would be a good thing. Mariel, can you put two green bowls on the bottom left to balance that? We're off just a hair there. You got it. I can't put this place up for sale until New Year's. What if you open the restaurant back up? Ugh. I mean, technically this is a bed and breakfast, and some people may wonder where the breakfast is. We have muffins, and that was my husband's restaurant and no one else's. I understand. But it really would sell better if it was for sale during the holidays. You know, really sell that feeling. All right, I'll think about it. Everything all right? Yeah, I think so. Hey, Steve. Oh, oh. Hey, Mom. Hi, sweetie. Everybody. Do you need me to call an ambulance, Steve? No, I'm just out of breath. Hey, he's moving. What are you talking about? No. Is he serious? Yes, I've been looking into houses at South Carolina. You're going to move somewhere where it doesn't snow? My plan was to wait until after Christmas to tell you, but I'm going to be closer to Stephanie when she's going to college. Okay, maybe you're just upset. We're going to figure this out. Maybe you're stressed. You can't move away from here. I mean, where are you going to find this? I don't want to find this, Mom. I want to move away from this. Maybe you just need a girl. Rudy, it's been 10 years. Yeah, I know, and it's not getting any easier. I've tried. I've tried to put on a happy face every year. I've tried to date, but there's just no one. There's no one like Nora. You have to stop looking for her. She's gone. But there could be so many other people out there looking for you. Yeah, idiots. Oh, shh. Look, I made up my mind about this. Okay? I gotta get back to work. Rudy, there's somebody out there for you, and they're lost, too. Yes, I will take a cup of coffee, anybody. We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Turn left. Bonus fry. How'd you get away from me. Turn left. Come here. Almost gotcha. Ha. Turn left now. There you go. Merry Christmas. Hey, how you doing? Good, how you doing? Two hot dogs, please. You mean two Christmas dogs? What's the difference? Between what? Two Christmas dogs, please. Do you want Christmas ketchup or Christmas mustard? Ohh. Oh. Hi. Sorry. I crashed my car in the woods, and I can't find my phone, and I could really use some help. Okay. I'm Holly, by the way. Rudy. That hot dog looks awesome. Oh, I was told these are Christmas dogs. Yeah. Do you want one? Yes, I do. You're a food critic? Yeah. It's harder than you think. You know, I mean, this hot dog, for example, could you give it a review? Me? Sure. This hot dog is hot. I don't know. What would you do? In a country that basically salutes the hot dog, it's hard to stand out, but Chef Rudy's inspired take on this classic dish elevates it to something more meaningful. The prime ground pork, bathed in salty brine explodes with flavor, and the zigzag pattern of ketchup and mustard gives this dog a flavor profile that lingers long after the last bite. Wow. I know I've already eaten a hot dog, but I immediately want another hot dog after this. High praise. Yes. It's green. Yeah. There it is. Sorry. Not your fault. Could I maybe borrow your phone to call an Uber? Oh, yeah, sure. You know the number? Is there like a hotel in town? No hotels. But... There's this one place. Great. Mariel, you did a great job. Oh, thank you. Oh, it's beautiful. Did the green balls go in the right spot? Yeah, no, see, it balanced out really well. Well, that was quick. Mom, please. This is your mom? Stop. Stop it. stop it. She broke down, she's going to need a place to stay. Oh, that's too bad. Well, you came to the right place. This is great. I'll get a room ready for you. What is your name, hon? Holly. Oh. Rudy, where'd you find her? Oh, the woods, actually. In the woods? That's great. Mariel, you got to buy some hiking gear. Could I just borrow your phone really quick? We have one of those. Rudy, show her where the... It's in the kitchen. Don't forget to dial out. She doesn't have to dial out. Oh, did they change that? Yeah. Yeah, they did that last week. No, they didn't. They still have to dial out. I don't think you have to dial out anymore. It's just a basic landline. Yeah, we can kind of... Oh, landline. Dial nine first. I'll show you the phone. Okay. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Holly. Nice to meet you as well. Yeah? Hey, it's me. Where are you? You said you'd be here by now. I got into a little accident. Oh, my God! Did my dish break? Did it break, Holly? And... Are you okay too? Yeah, I'm fine, you know. Car is totally banged up. My phone is now crushed. But your dish is fine. And I will be there tomorrow night, just in time for your parents. Okay. Just don't be late. My parents are kind of serious people. Okay? You got it. Okay. All right. Around to third. Over to second... Oh, it's fine. This is a nice place. Yeah. Wait, is... Is this your restaurant? Oh, no, no. It's my dad's. It was my dad's. Yeah, amazing chef. Yeah. This place closed after he died. Now it's less of a bed and breakfast and more of a bed and assortment of muffins. Hey, I really appreciate everything. Oh, yeah. It's rare we get new people around here, so happy to help. Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot to pay you. No, no, no, it's fine. I have to pay you something. No, no. Please. I know what it's like to be in a bind. It's okay. Really. Well, that's really nice of you. Yeah. So I'll swing by tomorrow to take you to the auto body shop. My buddy should have you out of here in no time. Thanks, Rudy. Yeah. Sure thing. Oh. Oh. Do... Do you like fireplaces? Yeah. Yeah, me too. You know, especially when it's like cold and it's just the fireplace. Makes it warm. Yes, yes. Yes, it does. Oh, thank God. Your room is ready. Number two. Here we go. Thanks. Great. Good night, Holly. Good night, Rudy. Good night, son. Right this way. Number two, honey. Come on. Here we are. You make yourself right at home. Thank you. Lovely. Good, yeah. So Rudy tells me you are a food critic. Yeah, that's something. You should do a review of the hot chocolate stand. It's magical. Maybe next year. I have to leave pretty early in the morning. Meeting my boyfriend's parents. Boyfriend. Oh, here comes the man in love. Look at that saunter. Deb called me right away. Emily sounds perfect. It's Holly. Even better, I love that name. Wait. Is that Rudy? Oh, yeah, that's my Rudy. Yeah. He and his dad would stand in that hot chocolate line every single night during Christmas. Man. My husband died right before Rudy and Nora were married. When she passed away, he never took another sip and never stood in that line again. She's just somebody who broke down, so I helped her. I was doing my job. You know, I think she broke down right here. Right in your heart, Rudy. He seems like a good guy. He is. And he's single. Oh, I'm not single. Remember I said I was meeting my boyfriend's parents? Vaguely. Yeah. I like this. I like her for you. You look vigorous. You got a smile on your face. I haven't seen that in a decade. Well, you have a good night. Call down the front desk if you need anything at all. Okay. Or if you happen to break up with your boyfriend. What? Nothing. Good night. Hey, you know what I think? I think you're Pine Falling for her. That's the name of the town! Hey, I only have like 15 minutes to write this. Okay. And frankly, I think you're required to laugh at the jokes your mayor makes. Fireplace. Awesome. Yeah. I could stay here forever. Maybe you should. Oh. Oh, no. I can't. Oh, no, I was just... I was just kidding. You should probably go or stay. The king of small talk returns. You want to ride to the shop? Sure. Monday? Yeah. Ugh. I'm sorry. It's just hard to get parts like that on a Saturday. It's okay. I'm supposed to be in Boston tonight visiting my boyfriend's parents. You want a candy cane? I feel like it always helps with the bad news. Sure. Pick you up! It's over an hour that way and an hour back! I don't know how else I would get there. Did she say boyfriend? Steve told me you guys were together. What? Yeah, he said you guys fell in love or something. I'm going to be outside. This boyfriend is really going to throw a monkey wrench into things. Uber? They don't really have that here. Lyft? Also no. Uber Eats. How would that even work? I don't know, you're the food critic! Look... You made me swallow my toothpaste. Look, my parents are going to be really upset about this. I can still be there Monday. Fine. I'll see you Monday. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. You know, I can give you a ride. No, that's okay. Actually, could I bum a ride back to the bed and breakfast? Yeah, sure thing. It's actually not the worst town to be stuck in. Oh yeah? Yeah. People are nice. It's really festive, if you like that kind of thing. It's safe. I don't know if that bear eats strangers. Oh, sorry. Hey, Missile Towing. Oh, hey, darlin'. Yeah? Okay. Everything bagel? Check. Uh-huh. Cream cheese. Right. Toasted. Okay, I'll see you soon. It's my daughter. Daughter? You seem surprised. I am a little, to be honest. You just... you struck me as a guy who lives with two big dogs with old man names. Like Bert and Coffee. I can see that. But no. Her name's Stephanie. She's 17. She's very, very cool. She's also really nice and smart. So, you know, usually I spend most of my days feeling a mix of dumb and proud. Yeah. Those are great dog names, by the way. Yeah. Also, did you say the name of the company was Missile Towing? That's so cute. Oh, no, no. It's like missile, like... It's because I get there fast and, you know, missiles are pretty awesome. But it gets a little confusing around Christmas, but the rest of the year, it's pretty cool. What? You don't think missiles are cool? No, no, no. I think missiles are super cool, Rudy. So... you want to get a bagel? Another finalist for Best Christmas Town in America is Pine Falls. This cozy little town outside of Boston has big holiday spirit and a delicious hot chocolate the locals can't stop raving about. To find out the winner, tune in this Monday on Mornings with America. Stephanie? Hi. Hi, I'm Holly. It's nice to meet you. Are you guys, like, is this a thing or... Oh, haha, no. She's a drifter. My car broke down last night and your dad and grandma helped me out. Yeah, that sounds about right. Have you had that chocolate yet? No. Man, this is hot chocolate is the talk of the town. Oh, my God, it'll change your life. Maybe she could try it next year or a year after that, or who knows, maybe Holly will never come back. Nice dad. You look all dressed up. You heading out? Yeah, dad, it's the Bonanza Cup. Oh, that's tonight? Bonanza Cup? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a Skee-Ball tournament at Mel's Lodge, like everybody in town goes. Oh, my gosh, I love Skee-Ball. You do? Yeah. Oh my God. Excuse me. Oh. Missile Towing. Hey, Rudy, guess what? I found the part for that lady's car. Oh. She's good to go. The car's ready. Okay, great. It was right here in the shop the whole time. It must have been here for years. I walked by it, like, every day. Funny, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her. All right, talk to you later. Bye-bye. I got some bad news about your brakes. Is everything okay? Yeah. So Skee-Ball? Yes! Oh! I mean, clearly she's cheating. Okay. By being better than you. Has anyone tested the weight of these balls? What's the date of the last inspection? Hey! Whoa, that's you? Yeah. You have, like, over 200,000 followers? You gotta review the hot chocolate stand. Oh. Yeah. That would be huge for this town. Soon to be number one Christmas town in the US. Wait, on Mornings with America? Yes! And a producer just called me. He said, start getting the stuff ready. So it's so exciting. I gotta go sit down. He's a sweetheart. Yeah. So Philadelphia, huh? Mm-hmm. That's gotta be pretty cool. Oh, it is. I mean, but this... This is incredible. Yeah. Feels like I visited Christmas. Yeah. You know, Pine Falls is without a doubt the best place on Earth for Christmas. Mm-hmm. You know, my dad just seems to be the only one who doesn't think so. You know? I'm beginning to get that impression. Yeah. Well, you should see him the rest of the year. He's like a barrel of fun 11 months out of the year. You should see our house at Halloween. It is decorated like you would not even believe. But, you know, when Christmas comes around, he's just not there. I never knew my dad. He left when I was young. But my mom was incredible. She used to have to work double shifts at the department store every Christmas, because, I mean, no one else wanted to, obviously. And since we couldn't afford a sitter, I basically lived at the mall every year. Really? Mm-hmm. That actually sounds kind of awesome. It was. Yeah. I mean, and she knew everybody there. So I would just go from store to store to store all day long. I mean, Christmas music blasting 24-7. Yeah. And everyone there was just so bright and happy and cheerful and filled with the Christmas spirit. But the best part out of all of this was that I got to spend all that time with my mom. And for someone who had to work pretty much non-stop on Christmas, I truly did love it. Seems like a great dad. Yeah, the best. Let's see if we can't shake a little spirit out of him. Yeah. Let's go. What? I think they're making fun of you. Anyway, back to my point, I'm not corrupt. What? You're in the championship. I am? Yeah. Who am I playing? Oh, no. Let's skate. Oh, boy. Yes! Okay. I'm the best. I'm the best. Oh! In your face! Yeah, yeah. So you got one ball left. All right. You need 50 points. He needs 10. So if you just sink the 50, you're good. I could get 50 with one ball. You got it. It's actually extremely difficult. You got it. Holly. Yeah! Oh yeah! Boom! Yeah. Do you know where I would love to go right now? Where? I'm excited for this hot chocolate. Just one? Everybody! I just got off the phone with the producer from Mornings with America and he said to expect a very big call tomorrow. That's awesome. I mean, it's great. No, it's not definite. But it's definitely a probably. Okay. It's huge! That's awesome. Yeah. What a wonderful thing you all have here. I mean, it's like a line full of people who actually enjoy being in a line full of people. They do. Sheryl here hasn't missed a Sunday since Dave's mom opened the place. Isn't that right, Sheryl? That's right. Bob and I are here every Sunday. We love it. Dale, you met your wife here. Oh, oh, yeah. The new one. Not the divorced one. No, the divorced one... Hey, you're still here. Well, yeah. You have my car. Oh! No, you know, I just... What? Oh, look, I think we're up. You got it. Bye. Sorry, folks. We're all out. You've got to be kidding me. That's how it works. When he's out... He's out. What is it about this hot chocolate that makes it so special? Well, I'd like to think that it's the chocolate that I use, or maybe it's the anticipation of Christmas in the air or the spirit of the crowd waiting in line. Who knows? One thing I can tell you for sure, like my mother before me, every cup of hot chocolate has a secret ingredient. The secret ingredient is love. You see, because no cup is truly enjoyed, unless it's served in the presence of love. You folks have a good evening, and maybe I'll see you in a while. Now I want hot chocolate. This is for you. Thank you. You bet. It will be ready in just a sec, okay? Got it. Okay. Your mom was beautiful. Yeah, she was. You know, it's funny. The same reason that he hates Christmas is kind of the reason I love it. You know, I was so young when she died that I only have, like, these short memories of her. You know, like, like flashes of happiness. They were always, always around Christmas. And every year, like, out of nowhere, a new memory pops up. That's why I love Christmas. Because once in a while, she comes back. But, you know, dad on the other hand, well, he kind of disappears. Second dinner is ready. Wow. Look at the knife skills on Rudy. Yeah, my dad taught me how to cook. You still haven't watched me make anything. Now I'm a master grill cheese maker. Listen, you'd be surprised how the simplest recipes... Whoa! That's not just any grilled cheese. No, it's not. It's grilled brie with cranberry chutney and thyme. Stephanie's favorite. Speaking of... I'm going to bed. Okay, good night. I'm not kidding, Rudy. This is really something special. Maybe next time I'm in town, I can review your all grilled cheese restaurant. Next time? Well, I think that sounds nice. Maybe we can chitchat more about fireplaces. I'm not sure how your boyfriend would feel about that. Yeah. Yikes. Sorry. Really. Whoa, I'm no good at this, am I? No, you are not. Not great. It's okay, really. It suits you. It's charming in its own way. Oh, good. You know, it's been really nice breaking down here. Yeah. Best Christmas in a while. Hey, can I crash on your couch? Well, don't crash. I'll have to tow you out of there. Oh, boy. It's getting worse, isn't it? Right, okay. Stupid. It's okay. Merry Christmas. For sale? Yep. I made up my mind. I wanted to wait, but my financial guy said I'd get more money for it if I put it up during the holidays, so I'm going to do it? Mom, this place has been in our family for 50 years. Yeah, yeah, I know that. You know, what do you care anyway? You're moving, right? What if I didn't? I don't know, mom. I'm on the fence. Is it that girl, maybe? No. Maybe. I don't know. All I know is you can't sell this place. I can't make the money up here, okay? Well, why don't you open the restaurant back up? I don't know how to run a restaurant. Besides, that was your father's restaurant. We made a million memories in that place. You were just a little kid. You'd stand there and you'd watch him cook in that kitchen. I'm not going to let some schmuck come in off the street and turn it into something else. I won't do it. Who's living in the past now? The difference is I've tried. Rudy, you gave up. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. No, you're right. Sell it. I'm moving. This one's my favorite. You have to come see it. He's so smart. Hey, Dad. Hey. Oh, my God. You okay? Grandma Deb's selling the bed and breakfast. Can I ask you just... What are we doing? Right? What is this? We're just killing time until the car's fixed. Yeah, here's the thing. Your car's already fixed. Really? Yeah, it was ready yesterday before we went to Skee-Ball. Darryl called me. He told me that the part was ready. And you didn't tell me? Well, I was going to. I wanted to, but we were having a good time and I didn't want it to end. Dad, that's basically kidnapping. No, well, romantic kidnapping. Okay, somehow that sounds way worse. Look, I just... Last night was, I had so much fun. It was like the most fun I've had in years. I mean, I had so much fun too. That's the thing, right? I mean, the truth is, it's all going to end, right? And we're going to get hurt. And at the end of the day, you got a boyfriend still. And I'm moving anyway. What? You're moving where? I've been looking at houses in South Carolina. I was waiting for the right time to tell you. So you just decided to lump that in with the whole like kidnapping thing? Would you please stop saying that? I'm sorry, I lied to you. You're a really great person, but whatever this is, it's over, right? Yeah. Of course. Right. That would be crazy, right? Yeah, I'm glad we're on the same page. Of course, yeah. I mean, not that I didn't... No, and me too. Of course, I can't. Sure. Yeah. Well, I should go pick up my car. Right. Bye, Stephanie. Bye. It was so good meeting you. Yeah, you too. We had a fun time. Yeah. You know, with meeting you and, uh... Sorry. Yeah. Okay. Best of... Good, safe travels to you. Really? Thanks, Rudy. Hey. I think you have something really special here, Rudy. Bye. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the moving thing earlier. Um... I'm just going to go for a walk. This is the one, this is the one. Mayor Hanks! Ah, no, I get it. I get it. Thank you for calling. I really appreciate your hospitality. You are very welcome. It's really been lovely having you. And I'm really sorry you didn't get a chance to try that hot chocolate. Maybe next year. Yeah, I hope so. Take care. Bye-bye. Mom and I would walk by here when I was little. She said this is where I'd get my dress for prom. We'd just sit here and, like, pick out which ones we wanted. Yeah. Just remembered that this morning. She'd have been so proud of you. You know, Holly's nice. And I think you guys would be a good couple. I just... I can't picture myself with anyone else. I can't either. I think we should try. What would mom think? You like bah-hum-bugging around. You know, being miserable. Not decorating. I could help you pick out a dress. Yeah, right. Probably make me wear sweatpants. Well, they make nice sweatpants. Dad. Mom would want you to be happy. And I want you to be happy. Oh, okay. Fine. Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm going to find Holly. Correction, we are going to go find Holly. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm going to come too. Duh. You're driving. Hey, Steve. You okay, bud? We didn't win the Mornings of America contest. Oh. I'm sorry, pal. They're going to give it to some town in Connecticut with like the oldest Santa Claus or something. I told everybody last night we were a shoo-in. It's pretty embarrassing. Oh, Steve, I never see you sad like this. Well, I get sad a lot. You know, everybody sees me as this happy-go-lucky guy with narrow but muscular shoulders. And sometimes I get sad enough that I just want to run away. You remember when I campaigned against that guy two years ago who just kept saying... Don't trust a guy with a face like a puppet. Shades of that. Anyway, I knew I had to beat that guy. I mean, no matter how sad all those posters made me feel, I had to stay and fight for this town. Because it matters to everyone that you try. Even if you fail, just the act of trying can inspire others to do the same. And that's what this town needs. And that's what I try to be for. Where are you going? I thought you were done. I was wrapping up. No, you sounded like you were at the end, like there's a period. Pause isn't done. Well... We're going to get Holly. Where's Holly? Dad made her leave town. You finally find a girl and stop acting like a sad donkey and you kick her out? We're going to find her, okay? Well, then I'm coming with you. This is my favorite part of every movie. All right, here we go. She left through the garage. Okay, I'm going to find her. Oh, also, I'm buying the restaurant. You are? Wait! I'm coming too. This is good. It's great. Let's go. Double time. I'm going to need my coat. My winter coat's upstairs. It's right there. That's a perfectly good coat. Let's go. That's a light jacket. It's cold out. This one's not very warm. Give me this one. Guys, I'm double parked right now. Put this arm down. You're going to pull something. Okay, there you go. You're good enough. 80% is done. Let's do it. Here we go. Here we go. How many stop signs are there in this town? A lot. Steve, can you do something about this? You wouldn't believe the amount of people that complain about the lack of stop signs. Yeah, okay. If people in this town had their way, it'd be nothing but speed bumps and stop signs. There's a sign right here. Stop right in the back there. All right, go ahead. Get in there. What are you doing? I can't get the seat belt off. Somebody move the coat! Somebody help! Come on! You got to move. I think you're sitting on it. I told you to get a new truck. You're sitting on it. Now move, move, move. Watch your fingers. I definitely loosened that. You know, I didn't vote for you, Steve. [ Machinery whirring I really thought that was going to end differently. Sorry, Rudy. She was a sweet girl. Son, were you serious about reopening your father's restaurant? I was. I am. All right, see you guys. You know, I don't want to point fingers as to why we missed her, but... Deb. Deb's why we missed her. Hi. Are you looking for Tommy? No. Uh... Could you just tell him Holly stopped by and that it's over? Oh, wait. Could you not open the door, please? Tommy, so good to see you. Holly, I can't believe you're in town. Right now. Right here. Oh man, it's great to see you. I brought your dish. Oh, thank you so much. You got it. Bye. You can't stay in the car all night. You want to get out? Yeah? Yeah. Why don't you just call her? Never got her number. You're so old. Yeah, well, in my defense, I ran over her phone, so there wasn't really much point. And yeah, I'm not really much of a phone guy. Oh yeah. Hey, you want to watch Love Actually? Really? Seriously, Love Actually? Yeah, I always like that one. My father, watching Love Actually. Okay. What? Okay. You're like... How do I put this gently? A Nightmare Before Christmas. Not like rom-com... Don't even... I'm changing it up. Okay. Okay. Let me change it up. You want to get that? Hello? This is Missile Towing. Oh no. Oh yeah. Yeah, that sounds serious. Okay, he'll be right over. Someone broke down on the town square. All right. Would it be okay if I came with you? Yeah, sure. Okay. Hey! Get out! Go after her! I thought you left. Well, I couldn't leave town without trying the hot chocolate. Wow. Yeah, that's good. Yes. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about your car. I just... I was having a good time with you and I didn't want you to go and it's... I know that's weird and then I got weird and then... I tried to come find you, but you went to see your boyfriend and I just... I did. Yeah. And yeah, I left to go see my ex-boyfriend. Oh. And it turned out he had another girlfriend. Darn it. That's... I'm sorry, but that's... It makes me smile a lot. Look, I'm just glad I got to see you again and tell you that I had a really good time with you and whatever this is, it's kind of cool. Well, I'd like to tell you something then. What's that? I think I'm Pine Falling for you. Yikes. Yeah? Oh boy. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah. You know, Steve told me to say that. Okay, that tracks. Thought it'd go better, honestly. But the sentiment. Okay. I think I'd like to stick around. If that's okay. Yeah, I'd like that. I think I will too. I'd like that. Kiss her. I'd like that. You're crying? Oh my God, Steve. Good one, huh? Yeah. Oh! Geez Louise, is this made out of sea kelp? I've been reviewing the culinary world for years now. High-end restaurants and talented chefs. And while I've enjoyed most of them, I realized something while standing in line on the cheerful streets of Pine Falls. Sometimes, the things that make something special can't be manufactured in a kitchen. Looking pretty good in here, Chef Rudy. They have to be experienced. They become special because of shared moments and ingredients that don't show up in the written recipe. Like joy, laughter, and sometimes even love. I'm not saying there's something in the hot chocolate at David's Hot Chocolate Stand. I'm just saying drinking it is a magical experience. So if you find yourself in Pine Falls, hop in line. Maybe I'll see you there. Ten out of ten.
