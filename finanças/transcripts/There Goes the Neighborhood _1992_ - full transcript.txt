( cat meows ) This one's unlocked. ( telephone rings ) Willis and Martha can't come to the phone now. Please leave a message. ( beep ) Hey, Willis, it's your wake-up call. Willis, get up. Are you listening to me? Huh? See you in the bubble. Yeah, o.k. ( tape rewinding ) ( woman's voice ) Willis, I'd tell you this in person, but as you say, I have a fear of confrontation. I'm leaving you. I need to find myself, and traveling around the world is the answer. So I took the $5,000 from your account. I'll pay you back when I can. I hope you're not mad. Since you're a psychologist, you'll understand this is nothing personal, just something I have to do. Goodbye. ( beep ) ( car engine starts ) You're late. So shoot me and put me out of my misery. ( click ) Aah! Heh heh heh heh. You're crazy. You know that? Is that your professional opinion? Heh heh heh heh. You should've seen your face. Ha ha ha ha! Opening one. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! This do anything for anybody? Lyle? I was up all night. Ask Harry. You weren't up all night. You snored all night. O.K., anybody? Give it up. Nobody wants to be here. Well, maybe that's why they call it prison. If you were a better shrink, we'd all be out by now. Aha! O.K., there's something right there. Now, what's he doing, huh? Come on, everybody. He's blaming his problems on somebody else. Somebody else put us in here, Willis. If you were good, you'd be on Park Avenue listening to some rich bitch's sex life. Not all therapists are into money. Only assholes don't want money. You can be happy without money. You happy? You look like shit. Thank you. Today is an exception, O.K.? My girlfriend moved out on me. Oh. Aw! Ooh! I can get her legs broke. Hey, put that away. ( glass shatters ) Take it easy! The guy's heart's broke. I got a theory about your temper. You're trying to be tougher than your brother. He is. I met his brother. He's chicken shit. Just because you had college for four months doesn't make you a genius! Can we talk about something else, please? You going to pick up that glass? Here. Tell us what you see. O.K. Well, I see a bunch of guys trying to avoid talking about themselves. ( coughing ) Tricks, you O.K.? Oh, this cancer's starting to win. The doctor said two weeks, maybe three. Oh, God, I heard. There. Just don't burn down the place. I want to tell you a story. It's about a job five of us pulled back in '57. We ripped off the mob for $8 1/2 million. I want you to go get it. ( coughs ) Wait a minute. You're talking about stolen money, right? Willis, it was stolen even before we took it. Came from a casino skim bank. You know what that is. Oh...yeah. I'm the only one alive who knows where the money is. You're my best friend. I want you to go and get it. Keep half for yourself and give half to Louise Bump. Here...sweet Louise. She still writes to me. Oh, good. Let me think about it. Don't think about it. Do it. Don't be stuck in this dead-end job. Do something real for once. Dig down 7 feet in the basement of a house in Cherry Hill. It was new then. Jack Sausegal's concrete company did the neighborhood. He poured a foundation over it the same day. He drew three circles in a triangle in the cement. Dig there. 73...22... Pleasant Street. Willis... this is my last request. 732...4 Oh! You promised it to me on our anniversary! I did not. You're lying! I did not! Yes, you did! I never-- No! ( bells ring ) We'll never finish our book at this rate. How can we work when they're screaming? Maybe sitting at our desks would help. We still need a title. Maybe something with the word "sex" in it. Look at Jessie's house. What's he saying? Lydia, I don't read lips. Oh, now she's crying. He's a bastard. Give me those! We should be working. You started this. Norm and Peedi are having cold cereal again. Talk about boring. Chews with his mouth open. Swallow that, Norm. My God. Ouch. He's going to murder her. He's got a chain saw! I'll call the police. Call Marty Rollins. Marty the realtor? Why him? ( arguing continues ) I'm calling the police. This spoon is dirty, Peedi. I don't think we should get involved, pumpkin. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Let Jeffrey and Lydia handle it. They're probably monitoring the whole thing anyway. Aah! Aah! No! No! Aah! Oh, no! Aah! Aah! You wanted half, you got your half! I cut. You choose. You're a psychopath! Any man who could destroy a beautiful piano-- ( doorbell chimes ) Albert, meet the Colangelos-- Jim, Jean, Jerry, and Jillian. So, Jessie here? Ha! Hi, Jess, babe. We'll start in the breezeway and work our way back. By the way, that is a rare split piano. It's going to the Museum of Modern Art next month. I'll show you a breakfast nook that'll take your breath away. Come this way. That is a beautiful dress. I love the color. It brings out the blue in your eyes. Jess, babe? How could you use Marty Rollins? He hasn't sold a house in three years! And he's a sex fiend. Some of us are loyal to our friends. Besides, he's getting help for his problem. No. He's beyond help. He's a maniac! Look who's talking. ( electrical buzzing ) Huh? Aah! You done your homework, Marvin. Like my mama taught me. You take care of Willis Embry? Uh, that's for sure. Ohh! ( paper bag rips ) Oh... Shit! Aah! ( sirens ) I saw him go upstairs with his groceries. I'm sure he was inside. He was always inside. Lady, there was nothing identifiable in that room. He was a good neighbor, never bothered anyone. That's because he had a very boring life. When he sang in the shower-- What a horrible voice! That's not grounds for murder, though. Ask Norm if I should up my asking price to offset the lower interest rate. Uh, should Jessie up her asking price to offset... the interest rate? That'll increase the value of our place, muffin. Tell her yes. Yes. How much? I'll ask him. Let me talk to him. Oh, Jess, he just went to, uh, work. 7-3-2-0, right? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. 73-20. Drive in here. All right. Now, gentlemen, I don't remember asking--huh? Shut your trap. How's that tape working out? Fine. Just the thought of exercise makes me tired. Oh, now, you're just depressed. Things will get better. Really. Why doesn't anyone on that tape sweat? Maybe it doesn't photograph well. How about you? I just wear the clothes. You're making a mistake! I got to go. Let me tell you something-- Try sh-- P-p-please... that's a Fabrizzi. Oh, yeah? They finished it off. What do you mean? The basement. It's a rumpus room. They got a big-screen TV, jukebox, VCR. Any good tapes? Gone with the Wind, Last Picture Show, Casablanca-- Casablanca? Is your version black and white or colorized? I think Ted Turner is making a big mistake, don't you? The floor! What's on the floor? Linoleum. I think it's Armstrong. Rip it up. Mmm! Mmm! Shut your mouth! Mmm mff mmm! Shut up! Just as soon shoot you as look at you. Is he always this edgy? Take a look at this. I did not think he'd kill him. I really have to talk to him, Lyle. Hey, I wouldn't do that. He's very sensitive about being criticized. He's on medication. Did you put down that linoleum? Mmm mff hmmf... Ma'am, did you see three circles in the cement? And a triangle? Uh-uh. We can rip up the whole goddamn floor. We don't know anything about-- I can't understand you, mush mouth. Speak up. We don't know anything about circles. You liar. Hey, Marvin, Marvin, easy. Now, we can use them. Can I talk to you for a minute? Marvin, just look at this-- Thank you. Don't contradict me in front of the hostages. I didn't. You know, it's embarrassing. I'm about to bash somebody, you tell me not to. It makes me insecure. I'm sorry. Ffm hht mmm mmm... Shh! Don't make me look bad in front of them. If the mailman notices they're turning black and blue, the cops will be all over us. It's not easy... you know, having all this responsibility. It's not easy. Now let's go back in there. Let's get them on our side, big fella! Don't ever hit me like that. Out... touch in. Half-circles. Big arms. Again. Out... and in. Half-circles. Step-touch. Front again. To the side. To the front. Front again. To the side. To the front. To the side. Last time. ( doorbell chimes ) Furnace? Do I have one? Yes. I'm here to fix it. I didn't know it was broken. Did Albert call you? Uh... My ex-husband? No, yes. He-- He called yesterday. Can I come in? Basement's that way. Heel out. Heel out, break five... arms down. Heel out. H-hello, Frannie. Yes. I have a touch of the flu. Could you fax me over anything that you feel might be important until I shake this thing? Thank you. Have a nice day. Have a nice day. My father used to say that. Oh, really? I hate that. I'll keep that in mind. Got to take a pill. Get me a glass of water. ( crunch ) Oh. That was my last one. Doesn't matter. You got to learn to just say no. Ha ha ha! Excuse me. Could I go to the bathroom? No. I'm comfortable with that. Get out of the way. Yes. Let's dig, circles or no circles. ( shovels clang ) Furnace? Oh, I'm just looking for the fumes detector. Look what I found in your truck. Who gave you the right to go into my truck? Don't you have that backwards? I knew you weren't a repairman. Out! O.K., all right, look-- Hey, stay away! Did Albert send you here? I don't even know Albert. How'd you know his name? You just told me his name. Look, look, I can explain this. You've got one minute to leave. O.K., all right, O.K. I don't know what your problem is, but there are circles somewhere in here worth a lot of money. Not this way! Over there. O.K., O.K. And don't come back, or I'll call the police. There's money in this basement. You have 40 seconds left. No. Millions. 32. What do you mean, millions? Aw, never mind. 19. Calling the police will cost you money. I'll think about what you said. I may be the sanest person you ever meet, so don't treat me like a wacko. You're a pathological liar. Get out! I'm going. I'm on my way. Just take my word for it. I'm not pathological. Ugh! Uh... that was three kyoke coffees and--and one French roast. Are you sure it's decaf? Otherwise, I'll be up all night. Oh, yeah. I'm the same way. Norm has an espresso and just drops right off to sleep, but if I have one sip of coffee, it costs me half the night. I'm never effective after a bad night's sleep. Uh...huh. Ha ha! Hey, honey. You know, you have your safety on. Here. Good. Not allowed to have caffeine. Oh. Hold it! Stop! Whoa! Stop! Stop! May I... No, no, no, no! May I make a suggestion? What are you yelling for? That makes a terrible racket. We have the nosiest neighbors in the state. He's right. Lydia will die. She'll think we're putting in a sauna, which means they'll have to build a sauna. My idea is that I use your lawn mower. That will help mask the noise. So I let you out of the house? Do I look stupid? Well, then Harry can mow. Look... you-- You shut up. I'm running this, not you. Ha ha ha! Lyle, you mow. Harry, keep an eye on these two. And don't scare the neighbors. ( Marvin humming ) I would just like to say you have a lovely home. A sauna would be very nice. ( jackhammer drills ) I need lunch money. Jeffrey gave you $3.25 last night, dear. Oh, yeah. Goodbye. Bye. Give Jeffrey a kiss goodbye. She doesn't have to do that. He said I don't have to. You do, and take off the hat. I like my hat. It's awful. It doesn't do anything for you. I'm not taking it off. Jeffrey. Yeah. You are a sweet one. Swan, excel. O.K. ( Jeffrey ) Jessie Lodge has company. Why don't you like Swan? She thinks stepfathers are wicked. I'm obliging her. She's just too smart for you. The Rutledges' shutters are closed. Maybe they're making no-no. ( Jeffrey ) Are you kidding? They've been married 10 years. I can't believe they hired a gardener. How did you know, uh, Marty Rollins' phone number without looking it up? I looked it up. Not the other day, you didn't. That was delicious coffee. Well, it's all in having fresh beans. I could never get the milk to fluff up like that. Well, you have to have the right espresso machine. I've got a friend who used to fence hot espresso machines. That must be exciting work. Beats 9:00 to 5:00, I guess. I should know. I used to work in an office. Really? An insurance company. I figured they'd never miss a few thousand. They deal with millions, you know. I can believe that, health insurance, especially. It really has gotten out of control, hasn't it? I majored in sociology at Bryn Mawr. I have a million questions I'd like to ask you. Be careful! ( barking ) ( whistles ) May I ask what it is that we're looking for? Dig. You know... you should consider how odd it'll look to our neighbors to see a service vehicle parked overnight in our driveway. See, I normally go off to work about 7:30 in the morning and return by 7:00 at night. Those are very long hours. Yes. A long commute. We like the location. The benefits are decent. Make your point. My point is this-- Anything screws up, we're dead meat, right? So when I see you gentlemen being careless, I sort of take it personally. Spit it out! Our nosy neighbors are already wondering about the van, not to mention the kitchen shutters, so if you want the cops off our backs, things have to look normal. I have to be seen going to work. That's impossible. Not quite. You take the van like you finished work and park in the commuter lot. Tomorrow I drive off, as if to work, one of you on the floor with a gun. We switch vehicles, drive back in the van, sneak me into the garage. Then you have the appearance of business as usual. May I suggest one thing? Since Lyle has already been seen mowing the lawn, he should continue a program of hedging, trimming, and pruning. I can make up a list. That's a good plan, but I don't like it. W-well, I'm comfortable with that. This guy's nuts. Probably doesn't want to do the yard work himself. Take it easy! You dig. I don't want to mow the lawn. Just pretend. Norm! Oh, s-- Why are you even talking to them? Many of us want things. We say, "I want a relationship." ( telephone rings ) Hello. Don't hang up! Who is this? The guy from your basement. I feel terrible about what happened. Ha ha. You knew it was my machine. I'll get back to you if you leave a message. Beep! I just want to say I feel badly about what happened. I'm the guy from your basement. I apologize, and it-- ( click ) ( dial tone ) Don't get hysterical. Uh! Let me go! Let me go! Aah! Oh! Uh! Aah! You are a maniac! Aah! I am not a maniac. I'm a psychologist. Aah! Shh! Shh! Don't scream. Don't scream. Don't scream. Don't scream. Mm-mmm. Don't scream. Mm-mmm. O.K.? Mm-hmm. God! Did you hear that? I need ice. I need ice. Do you have some ice? Aah! Ooh! ( woman's voice ) Cherry Hill help line. If you're calling from a touch-tone phone, press 1 now. If this is an emergency, press 2 now. If you need the fire department, press 6 now. If you need the police department, press 7 now. If you call the police, nobody will get the money. They stole it from a mafia skim bank! Look! Right here! Right here. Look. See? Look. That's me. That's me. ( man ) Cherry Hill police. Uh, sorry. Wrong number. Sorry. Must be an old picture. It's nice to sleep in the same bed again. Reminds me of before we were married. Nobody has to know about our sleeping arrangements. Oh, they're all asleep. If I could get loose, we could run for it. This is a window of opportunity. They'd cut you down. They wouldn't risk the gunfire. Those guns have silencers. Yeah, well-- How do you know? Harry told me. "Harry told me." I'm your husband, not Harry. So? So you listen to me, not Harry. ( groaning ) I was just wondering if you use hollow-tip bullets. Sure. ( ring ) ( ring ) Hello. Don't think I don't know what you're up to. If you touch my wife again, I'll kill you. ( dial tone ) I think your husband just called. Oh, no! Oh, no, I shouldn't... It's O.K., Jillian. I shouldn't have done this! You did the right thing. No, I didn't! Lyle and Harry had something to do with your bombing? If they did, I'm disappointed. I thought we were getting somewhere. Maybe it's an ex-convict with some unresolved feelings about you. Sounds like you've had some therapy. Albert and I saw a psychiatrist. Then he ran off with her. Sorry. That's bad for the profession. You're good for it, breaking in with a pickax? You're very angry, aren't you? Sometimes if you talk through it, you can feel better. Look, doctor-- If you are a doctor-- I don't discuss my shitty marriage with just anybody. If you want to repress it, go ahead. I'm not. I'm furious, and I'm expressing it. Can I get some more ice for the... Thanks. So you want me to take my house off the market because there's $8 million in my foundation? 8 1/2. Well, excuse me for not trusting psychiatrists anymore. I'm a psychologist. There's a difference. I know. You're not as well-trained. Somebody tries to kill you, and you say you're disappointed? Talk about not expressing yourself. Look, I'll give you 10 percent of the 8 1/2 million. Ha! 10? This is my house. 50 of that goes to that lady in St. Louis. I could kick you out and keep it. I'd tell the police. Look, look, look. 20 percent. I'll do all the work. I want half of whatever you get. Half. Yes or no? Deal, but you do half the work. Oh, God! Oh! I know it's not easy for you right now, but, uh, things will work out. Whenever Albert used those words, I knew he was lying. Anything else? No. Do you want to, uh, you want to give her a try? O.K. So we're going on the word of a convicted felon called Tricks? It was his last request. Oh, well, then... Just aim for the circle. Nice swing. ( Jeffrey ) Norm just left for work. What was that noise last night? I slept through it. Digging. What? Somebody's digging. Maybe somebody's burying a body. Don't be juvenile. I am a juvenile. Do you have your lunch money? Jeffrey, give her lunch money. Swan, give Jeffrey a kiss goodbye. The money's on the dresser. Actually, the little... She may be right about the body. I heard some screaming in the night. Maybe Albert slipped over there and murdered her and buried her in the garden. Or maybe it was your friend Marty. Your corpse looks pretty healthy to me. How did you sleep? Oh, not bad. I've never slept tied up before. No? Come on. Pretty good plan, huh? Move. * You have a way * * With your way * * And I'm waiting * * For every way ** Do you have to sing? It makes the work go faster. Not for me. What are you, a music critic? You the one who picked out that astroturf? Albert did. Took absolutely no interest in this house or anyone in it. He was the most selfish, conceited, and ultimately dishonest person I've ever known. He never even voted. Huh. He screwed me. That's what people do to each other. It's an old story. And I let him. I put him through business school. We were going to have nine kids, only he changed his mind. He didn't want any kids. He didn't even want a wife. I see. So we started going to see a shrink, then he ran off with her. Yeah. You told me. This is what believing in marriage gets you. You can get shafted just as easily when you're single. A wedding ring is a "kick me" sign. You can get kicked with or without the sign. Maybe I don't want an answer. Maybe I just want to feel bad, O.K.? O.K. It's just hard. ( sobbing ) Oh, don't touch me. Oh, don't even think about it! What? What? What? What, are you kidding me? That was the last thing on my mind. A woman gets divorced, suddenly it's everybody's job to make her feel better. Look, look, if you don't want to talk, you just say so. I don't want to talk. Fine. Paper boy! Hey, get out of there. I'm collecting. How much? 7.50. They're busy. Here. Thanks. Whoa! I thought you said 7.50. Well, they usually tip me, and I don't have any change. You the new gardener? What if I am? My parents need one. I'm booked. They're competitive. They'll pay more than you're getting. I can't be bought. They'd never understand that. Tell them to go fuck themselves. They'll understand that. Do you think you could fix this chain? Sure... for 10 bucks. Paper boy! ( doorbell chimes ) Oh... ( horn honks ) Oh! Come on! ( knock on door ) Mrs. Lodge? Must be out back. ( Marty ) I think you're going to love this neighborhood. It's tres recherche. ( knock on door ) Mrs. Lodge, it's Marty! I have the Kims here! ( doorbell chimes ) You know what? We'll come back. What the hell is going on over here? Settle down. Ha ha ha! Lyle's talking to some kids out there. He shouldn't be talking to anybody. Hey, who asked you? Yeah, he shouldn't be talking to anybody out there. Harry, go get him. He started it. He squealed on me. He told the teacher on us. Break his glasses. What? You want to teach him a lesson? Break his glasses. Cut it out! There are rules to life. One of the most important you'll find is-- Nobody likes a squealer. Now tell him. He does it again, you'll hurt him. Come on! There's a philosophical point I'm trying to make here! The world is divided into the doers and the doees. The doees pay taxes and generally get shitted upon. People look up to the doers. I'm a doer! Lyle, may I speak with you? Sure. There's something seriously wrong with you. Maybe yes... maybe no. Jessie, it's me. What the-- It's Albert. I don't want him to see me like this. O.K. I'll take care of it. You might want to go out the same way you came in, pal-- Empty-handed. This is my house, pal. These are my clothes. I wouldn't brag. Your name Albert? Yeah. Who are you? Jessie says you got your share already. The rest is hers. You know that. Are you the plumber or just plumbing Jessie? Hyaaah! Don't make a move. I know karate. That was an antique. Give me the watch. It's my goddamn watch! It was her stereo! Oh, yeah? Not here, baby. Why don't we try the-- Albert, I didn't know you were here. Yes. He was just leaving. Damn. You know what, kids? You're going to hear from my lawyer. Does he know karate, too? You certainly don't waste any time. Oh, Albert. Hey, come on. We'll talk. Why can't you mind your own business? ( bell rings ) Quiche is ready. I'll help you with that. You dig. You help her. Smells good. It is good. I mean you. You must've studied sociology. Criminals have very poor impulse control. I'll bet you're the type that fantasizes gangsters breaking in here and having their way with you. Ohh... y-y-you're sick. It's a sick society. Oh, no. I don't buy that excuse. You've got to learn to be responsible for yourself. You sound like my shrink. Now, come on. You've got a lot going for you. You're good-looking, you've got a great body, an inquisitive mi-- You appreciate fine food and-- Did you say-- You say-- A good body or a great body? Let's serve the quiche. ( classical music plays ) Nice music. I plopped these tapes on 'cause I hid them when Albert was stealing the stereo. That doesn't mean that I'd be hiding things from you. We're partners. Did I say anything? You looked it. ( knock on door ) I didn't know you had company. Marty, this is Will... Goldberg. Willie Goldberg. He's a... he's an old, uh... cousin. He's an old cousin of mine. Cousin? Hello. I just dropped by to see if you needed anything. Got some serious buyers coming in next week. ( turns TV off ) Come on. Why did you-- I'm hearing noises. You're just imagining it, Marvin. Go check it out. It's just the neighbor trying to diddle the divorcee. He won't be long. Since when do you use the word diddle? Damn. Jeffrey... that man drove away in his van an hour ago. Aah! Aah! Marvin! Aah! I told you they had silencers! My Neiman! My investment! Your invest-- I never did like that painting anyway. May I speak without getting shot at? Marvin, we've got to get you more medication. Willis Embry's right next door. What do you mean? You can't see him from there. But the papers say-- You can't believe what you read in the papers. You know, I've had it with you. You talk and talk-- Ow! You stay away from me, Marvin. I'm not following any man who can't keep his cool. Aah! ( glass breaks ) You shouldn't have done that. I'm splitting. You want to walk away from $8 million? My ass is more valuable. If he knew we were here, he would've busted us. Not if he knows that we're sitting on the money. We don't want your money. Just don't hurt us anymore. I'd like to speak to you outside. You got anything to say, say it right here. I'm getting very perturbed. I want to have a discussion in confidence. Is it about me? It ain't. How do I know that? If you're worried about us running away, don't. Cuffs! Cuffs, cuffs. You heard him. Quick! Cuffs. Cuffs. Is that all right with you? Just don't bash the lady, Marvin. Just don't hurt me. Maybe it's just some guy who looks like Embry. You want fingerprints? I saw him. Uh-huh. ( door closes ) We're going to get that money. I don't want the money. I just want to survive this. You hit me when my back was turned. I don't want to talk about it. I'm very upset. I need to express it. Tough shit. You're creating a leadership crisis here. These people need to understand I'm in charge. Don't be that way. Three is a hard number. It changes the dynamic. May I interrupt this discussion to point out Willis Embry's ass? It's Embry. Get out of the way. So, Marvin... you're going to blow away Embry, the realtor, the woman, two different rooms with one burst? Jessie, I want to thank you for this opportunity. To do what? To sell the house. You're doing a good job. Means a lot to me. Can I, uh, have a hug? What for? I need one. O.K. Sure. Hey, Marty... Don't do that! Don't, Marty! What are you doing? I'm sorry. What are you thinking? Oh. Suburbia, man. Yeah. You're not going to your sexaholics anonymous meetings, are you? I've been busy. I'm taking a chance on you. Behave yourself and keep your hands off the buyers. I'm sorry. Sorry isn't good enough. You'll see. I will be better. I promise. I will. What do you think of that? You used to kiss me like that. So you'll really look up this Louise person? I promised Tricks. Honor among thieves? It's mafia money anyway. That makes what you're doing right? What we're doing right. ( knock on door ) Paper boy. Hi. Collecting. How much is it again? 7.50 plus tip brings it to 10. I'm getting my bike fixed. You want to contribute to a new bike? Maybe tomorrow. What are you digging? Jacuzzi. Drainage. Here's 10 more. Tell your parents you met my cousin Willie Goldberg. From Texas. You lost your accent. Did I? It's none of their business, in my opinion. ( door opens ) What a nympho. For someone who's turned off to men, you sure let Marty think he was getting somewhere. What are you talking about? I saw you kiss him. It's a good idea to avoid outside entanglements until we find the money, O.K.? You want to get the light? Look, not that this is any of your business, but Marty and I are just friends. Yeah, fine. You'd never find a man playing with emotions like that. Oh, I never found a man who had any. Women are no better. My girl told me every day she loved me, even the day she left me. Maybe she left you because you called her "my girl." ( cracking ) Uhh. I could get you a good return on your money. Shh. I hear digging. ( thump ) Lyle, are you sure you got the right address? I got us close. All right, so cheer up. At least you've got a good start on a decent tunnel. There are no problems with nosy neighbors. Ha ha. ( clang ) What are you doing? What are you doing? What were you doing? You were digging. I couldn't sleep. So you thought you'd dig quietly, find the money, wake me up, give me my share? Yeah, right. Let me do that. You know, maybe it would help you if you learned to trust people. You don't trust me like I don't trust you. I didn't say I did. I came down because I had lots of nervous energy. If you were a man, you would understand. You don't think I have nervous energy? I can't believe a psychologist could be so unaware of how to talk to a woman. You've worked too long with big, hairy convicts. You can't relate to a normal person. Normal? Please. It's no wonder your girlfriend left you. Sometimes people leave no matter how much a person loves them. Sometimes it's them, not you. Get back in the hole. I said get back in the hole now! All right, gentlemen, let's cut the crap. What I'm telling you is... undo me. I'm going to whack this guy. Go on, hit me! Come on! You need me. Norm, stop it. He's cracking, I'm telling you. Undo me. It'll change your lives. I can turn your 8 million into 85 million in 30 days. Norman, what are you talking about? Not now, pumpkin! I've got connections you can only dream about, and I can prove it. If you're not convinced, you can shoot me. Shoot you anyway. Go on. Undo him. This better be good, wimp. You call me sir from now on, all right? What are you doing? I said what are you doing? We can't let him do what he wants. ( Peedi ) Norm? ( gasp ) ( gasp ) From Cuba... with love. Relax, gentlemen. It's contraband. Russia's finest. Na zdorov'e! Compliments of resistance groups left and right. Norm, what is going on? Where did this room come from? The Eisenhower era, honey. It's a fallout shelter, a business write-off. I can't handle this shit. You're bush league. That's why. I'll kill you. Take it easy. Put it down. Now. Good boy, Marvin. Good boy. Take a look. Be my guest. Go on, gentlemen. Go ahead. I'm offering you connections-- Colombia, Switzerland, Havana, D.C., Moscow. It's the new American capitalism, gentlemen. Let's make a deal. First, we make a simple assault next door, we off the competition, but we do it in the American tradition-- Discreetly-- Or you go back to jail and me 9:00 to 5:00. I thought it was 7:00 to 7:00. Eat my shorts, Harry. I'm in charge now. Right, Marvin? Get out of the way. Come on. You know what these are? Concussion grenades. Repeat after me. Concussion grenades. We can blast the tunnel with these babies in no time. Let's shoot him. He's flipped. You better talk nice to Norm, or these guys will shoot you. Wait. Here. Thank you... Marvy. What are you doing? One working woman's special coming right up. Hope you like 'em scrambled. Ah-ah-ah. If you put salt on them, they won't be as fluffy. You want to cook them, make them fluffy? They're your eggs. Have them the way you want them. I could make tea. If you get me coffee, I'll give you 5 percent more of the money. Don't let them overcharge you on the fine, dear. Excel. How do you expect someone to excel when they have to ride this piece of shit? Maybe Jeffrey can fix it. Jeffrey can't change a typewriter ribbon. Jeffrey's genius doesn't lie in things mechanical, dear. You talk so weird. That's an expensive bike. It sucks. You'll have to clean up that little girl's mouth. Jeffrey, get bent. Oh. Lydia... do you believe this? I thought he was booked solid. That's bullshit. What's that noise? Lyle? I think they found the house. This neighborhood's too damn noisy. We can't get any work done. Marvin. Excuse me. I'd like a word with you, please. Is this concrete enough for you? Let's call the police. What, kiss that 8 1/2 million goodbye? They're trying to kill us! We're still alive, aren't we? They'll try again. This thing work? I thought you said you were booked solid. I am. Isn't our money good enough for you? Look, I'm busy. What is your name? If they're not gone in two minutes, ice them. Norman... are you insane? Honey, take the phone number off the truck. I'm reporting you to your supervisor. Why don't I take your names? Then if we have an opening next week, I'll do my best to fit you in. That's the best I can do. O.K.? Babitt. What? Babitt. B-a-b-i-t-t. Babitt. How can they chat with Jeffrey and Lydia? They want the money. That's their best hope. You ever consider nametags at all? Excuse me. The pen. You get the number, honey? Yes, I got it. Come on. Where are they going? Aah! Aah! He used to be a patient of mine. Willis, I think it's time we gave up. No! Look! We got them on the run! Hey. I'm going to kill that Willis. Hey, Lyle... you want to keep this? A little joke. It hurt. Norm, could-- Could you ask them to uncuff me? I don't want you involved. I just want to be undone. Pretty soon, dumpling. Marvin, we need the demolition hammer. Uh... O.K. Norman, you could shoot them. Shoot them? Not now, dumpling. Marvin, if you shore up that tunnel, a grenade will speed things up. Where are the grenades? Behind the couch. I just want to say I think you're doing a fantastic job. Thank you, Marvin. Coming from you, that's a compliment. I never wanted to be in charge. Oh. You spring guys from the joint, and they look up to you for leadership. Marvin? Grenades. O.K. Now? Will you let me go now? Not now, dumpling. Uh... how many? Two. Good. You did good. Why build this tunnel? If we want to kill them, let's finish the job. Norm wants a tunnel, we give him a tunnel. You don't like it, you talk to Norm. I live in this neighborhood myself. Beautiful shade trees. They've been here for years. Quiet neighborhood? Very. Ah, Mr. Goldberg. Your cousin around? Uh, no, she's not, no. Hi, Marty. Good to see you. Jessie, these are the Bratesmans. Hi. Hi. Marty, could you people come back later? The Bratesmans here drove from Philadelphia. They're very motivated. Just give us an hour. We have cleaning to do. Really, Jess, the Bratesmans don't mind if it's a little untidy. Fine, fine, fine. We'll be back. You got a minute? Well... Peedi, I don't know how to start. Uh... I, um... are you comfortable? I'm o.K. I was just wondering. I don't know how to say this. I... what does Peedi stand for? Oh, I never tell anybody that. Please tell me. Penelope. Penelope. Penelope Diane. May I call you Penelope? I'll have to think about that. At night... when I'm falling asleep with my pillow under my arm, wishing it was you... in my mind, can I call you Penelope? Can I touch you, Penelope? Oh... Harry. ( Marvin ) Harry! Where's that wrench? Ugh... Hey, what's your problem? Oh, I-- I'm handcuffed. ( telephone rings ) Wait. I'll get it. I said I'll get it. ( ring ) ( ring ) Rutledge residence. Lyle? Willis. We need to talk. I mean a real dialogue. I'll kill you. I understand your hostility. I'm sorry about shooting you. I've got a solution where everybody wins. I'm still going to kill you. Who is this? Who is it? Embry. Tell him he's a dead man. Marvin says hello, Willis. Listen, I-- I just want to work out a deal where nobody gets killed, O.K.? He wants a deal. We'll rip his arms off. Agree to anything. Agree to anything. How about we meet someplace? Where did you have in mind, Willis? You heard about Tricks Bissell's money, right? We heard a rumor. Tricks wanted something done with half of it, but the rest of it we could split if-- Now who's this one? Now they have three. How can they afford three people? I got to learn to read lips. Lyle, you've got to work harder on those hostile feelings. You shot him with an arrow. You blew up my apartment! That was Marvin. Uhh... Oh. He gets violent without his pills. Maybe you could write him a prescription. What you did was very aggressive. You tried to kill us! Oh, now you're exaggerating. Lyle... remember the progress we were making about your anger at your older brother? Leave my brother out of this. We're not your patients anymore. Oh, good, Willis. Who's this? What's going on here? Albert, these, uh, these men are interested in the house. This is Albert's house. Why are they so dirty? None of your business, asshole. That's O.K., Lyle. ( Albert ) Where's Jessie? No, no, no, no. Don't go back there. Don't-- Don't touch me, O.K.? Why not? Take another step, I'll kill you. Albert, why not come back later when these gentlemen are through looking through the house? Run a credit check on this guy. Why'd you let him leave? Why'd you? We want the money, Willis. O.K., O.K., O.K. How about we divide up my share? Huh? There's plenty to go around. That sounds like a good idea, Willis. O.K. We bought some time. He didn't buy it. ( explosion ) Aah! Aah! ( coughing ) Oh, wow! Oh! ( gasps ) ( car horn honks ) Wimps! We've got work to do! Wasn't that delicious? Marty, that was no hour. Fine. You know what, Mr. Bratesman? Let's start out back, O.K.? I like the color. Oh, yeah. Goes with your complexion. Hmm. Landscaping looks good. We can swing it if we lock into low interest rates? Dead cats, geometry, mother... mother usually works. What? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing works. You think she'd go down 10,000? I'll talk to her. Honey-- Just a minute. What about a second mortgage? Did you say that was possible? Yes, I think so. Why don't you check out the pool, Phil? May I call you Phil? Sure. Good idea. I don't think-- We'll probably have to do a little sprucing up. Are you crazy? Nice... How expensive is it to maintain a pool? Oh, pennies, really. Ha ha ha! Honey, look at this diving board. Will you stop? What's wrong with you? I'm trying to get help. You are? Yeah. So am I. We meet Wednesdays. We meet Tuesdays. Am I hurting you? Just a little. Mmm. Never mind my name. Just tell me your reward policy. If it's illegal, it's your civic duty to report it. Get a life. Are these the men? Yeah, these are the guys right here. ( thud ) J-J-J-J-J- Jessie! Oh. Penelope, can I get you anything? Oh! A key. Norm has the keys. Oh, he just wants to protect you, baby. I'd do the same thing if you were mine. Like this? No. Like this. Uh-- Oh, Harry, Harry, Harry. Ohh. Penelope... I'm going to go straight for you... right after we get this money. Oh, Harry. Oh... All right. O.K. Come to Papa. Uhh. ( choking ) Don't ever say that. O.K. Uh, I'm sorry. Sorry, Norm. O.K., Marvin, get your gun. I'll get my gun. Honey, be careful. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah. It's party time! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Hey. The power. Did you back this up? You should've. Now look what you did. Aah. Honey... Marvin! Marvin, come on! Aah! This is the Cherry Hill Police! You're surrounded! Come out with your hands up! No. No. Go! Positions! Hold your positions! Form cover! You in the rear! What is it? It's S.W.A.T. What's going on here? Somebody please tell us what is going on here. Back off, or I start killing people! What's the landscape man-- It's Marvin Boyd. He's done time for armed robbery. We're coming out with the lady! Anybody follows, she gets it! Where is she? Can't get her loose. Go get the key. Oh. Norm's got the key. I don't know where he is. I think he drowned. Ahh, Normie. Ahh, Normie drowned. Oh, oh, Harry. Uh, you're doing a wonderful job, Harry. I love you, Penelope. Ohh... He's staying with the broad. Yeah? That's his choice. Let's go. You look nice. Thanks. Here we go. Keep your head down. How can I drive with my head down? There's Mrs. Rutledge. Want me to pick him off? No. You heard him. Men, hold your fire. O.K., we're letting you go. We're out of here, baby. Shut up. ( car won't start ) Sounds like the battery. Oh, I need a pill. Aah! D-don't shoot! Hold your fire! Don't shoot! Oh, no. Oh. She's not in the car. Get 'em, guys. ( Peedi ) Aah! Are you hurt? No. Are you sure? Are you O .K., ma'am? There's a man inside. Do you need a medic? No. Are you sure you're o.K.? Damn it! Let me talk! There's a man inside, and-- And he saved my life. He-- He-- He wants to come out. He-- He wants to go straight. He-- He-- He wants a piece of the American dream. He-- He-- He makes great cappuccino. He-- He's afraid that you're going to kill him. O.K. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Uh, Harry? Uh-- Harry? It-- It's O.K., honey. Come on, honey. Come on out. ( Captain ) Handsome Harry. Don't-- Don't hurt him. Oh, Har...Harry. Mrs. Rutledge, where is your husband? Your husband, Mrs. Rutledge. Tricks was telling the truth, huh? I was so wrong about you. $8 1/2 million, Jessie. When you're through with that lovey-dovey shit, hand that to me. Norm? Norman, what are you doing? The suitcase. Now. Are they making you do this? Come on. Does Peedi know about this? Hand it over! It's spoken for by several parties. Now! Come on! That's far enough. Marty! On the floor, both of you! Look, it's not her fault, O.K.? Just let her go. Just take her with you or something, all right? But just don't kill anybody, o.K.? How about it, Jess? That was very nice of you. Oh, Marty, no, no. I-- I couldn't leave Willis behind. Then shut up and turn around, both of you! You try being realtors. Me? I'm through selling ugly houses to stupid people. Uhh! I don't think your house is ugly. That's far enough. That's my daughter. That's her daughter. H-h-hey, somebody stop him! Ooh! The biggest crook of them all. Freeze! Swan needs a new bike. I figured it'd be safer if nobody knew I was alive. Well, I think the insurance company-- Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... well, I mean-- I mean-- Well... Well... Look at-- It's just-- It's just-- It's just all rotten! Goodbye. You got a great future, kid. Hey, Norm. Sayonara, baby. Peedi, we can work this out. I'll write. All right, that's far enough, you Casanova. Jeffrey! He's fooling around with my wife. No! No! You knew his phone number! I don't care who she slept with. Give us the gun. His phone number was on the "for sale" sign! Just...sign? Yes. Oh. I, uh... Well, I'm sorry. I-- Uhh! Ugh! Hey! Hi. I'm Marvin Boyd. Ma-Marty Rollins. You never been in the joint, huh? The joint? No, never been. Well, come on. We'll sit together. Look, uh... I'm sorry about the way things turned out. I, uh... No. I gambled. I lost. Yeah. I met you. Is that good or bad? You tell me. Huh? Oh... Oh... Oh! Oh! Do you have Louise's address?
