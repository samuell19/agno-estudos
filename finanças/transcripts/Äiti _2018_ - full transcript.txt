What happened? Maria! What happened? Mikael! Eeva! Mikael! Mikael! The number is not in use, please... Maria Lindström. Quiet! Hi. Hi. You must be Lindström. Will the city be giving you a place to live? I mean, I have an empty room upstairs. You had some yard work to offer? Yeah, I have this skinny Estonian looking guy... He picks up dog poop in the yard. And he does grocery shopping. You have a daughter. Yeah. Yeah, it got tongues wagging. Some had heard this and some that. I could... Well, I mean... Lindström. There. How did it go when you stabbed your husband? Did you want to kill him, like, I don't care what happens! Or was it like planned? Or did you have domestic violence? Did you want to protect your daughter? Was there... incest? It would be exciting if there was that kind of abuse. Such a classic case. If you have no work, I think I'll leave. Whore. You murdering whore! Thank you. Well, some of the form is not filled out, but I think we can get something done. Well, yes... Start with that. He is here doing his civilian service. Hi. - Hi. Then you ask about her preferences. Do you have preferences? Preferences? Yes, ask about preferences. Do you have preferences? What job is she applying for? Logistics, decontamination work, customer services... Decontamination work? Deco... Alternative one, see. This would have been easier if you had been in contact earlier So we could have already made the job seeking plan Because jobs do not turn up just like that. I have agreed on some meetings to get things started. Yes, yes, but you should have contacted us earlier. Now you are at the mercy of employers. Well I don't think we can help, But I'll write on this bingo coupon... This is our property maintenance contact. You'd think they care for that if they care for this. Howdy! Can I help somehow? Hi. They gave me this. A bingo coupon? You maintain that village school over there? No. You don't happen to know anyone who would know if there were old papers or binders there? Strange question. Old papers or binders... Do you need binders? No. I don't know. Is something lost? Yes. I am looking for my daughter. - Okay... So I thought there might be some contact information. Yes, so you don't have any contact information? What is your daughter's name? Maikki Lindström, Maria Lindström. So you are Maria Lindström's mother? - Yes. If I was able to help I would. - Thank you. But when we have no friends in common... - Thank you. Good luck with your search! - Thank you. Eeva. Kalle. Do you have any work? Corridors, stairs, elevator and then this. Here it is enough to just vacuum. And there is no attic here. Same thing with the other house. You can leave your stuff in the closet. These with the tag are for stairs and storages And the ones with no tag let you into the apartments. Then we need to get you clothes. Hey, tomorrow! Replacing the thermostats, that's a good job for you to do. I could show you that... I could show you that right away. I usually do so that I ring the doorbell, listen for a while to see if anyone opens the door and if not, then we just go in and now we hope that nobody comes. The notice given says that - ”Residents must make thermostats easily accessible”, But nobody gives a shit and often there's furniture blocking the way - Then you just move it and leave the furniture there, so they get the message for the next time. So, loosen here, take out the old thermostat, Put the new one in and tighten like this. So this tomorrow. And now we leave before we are caught. Hi. - Hi. Do you know what time it is? It's a bit late for... you just tell the right answer and when - And now we have a new caller on the line! Hello there, who's calling? Pena here. - Well, hello Pena! Before you answer, tell us where you are calling from? From Mantsala. We are warming the sauna with my wife. Pena from Mantsala, check! And now, Pena from Mantsala, tell us - What's the city in Finland with two U letters? Hello? - Hotel reception, good evening. Is this Eeva Lindström? - Yeah. I need to ask you to leave the hotel. Excuse me, what? We must take into consideration the safety of our guests... Well. Pack your things and leave. You cannot enter my room in the middle of the night. The hotel has the right to choose its guests. And you will leave now. I have the right to be here. Hotel owners disagree with you, so get out. Seriously... There, off you go. Try to behave, Goddamn it! An adult woman... You know that your head is bleeding? Yeah. Hi. Hello. How's it I going? Fine. I realised that... With you we haven't done the inspection we usually do when people start working. Inspection... And the question in this inspection is Do you know how to smile? Yes, she knows. I am glad to note that you have passed the inspection. Just remember to use this skill out there. Okay, thank you. These are your work shoes. I hope they fit you. Thank you. And... Keys to the van. Thermostats are in the back. You do have a driver's license? There is a patio. I saw your advert by accident when I was looking for a trailer, That you need a flat. Yeah. The tenants have come and gone so quickly. It would be nice to find one who stays longer. Would it... Would it be possible to pay the deposit in instalments? Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... You're in that kind of situation. I don't really know, it's a bit iffy with instaliments. Though I have made exceptions. Sometimes exchanged payments for work. That could be good alternative. For example cleaning my home could be one thing. If you could wash my dishes once a week? That could work. I am usually there. Could you be naked? Wash the dishes naked? Just lightly, With a good mood. That way we could come to an agreement. OK... Are you...? Or... Are you on holiday? Or can you leave just like that? I got pardoned. - Right... Is Leena home? No... How is life for you? Well... Here it goes. I am looking for Maria. Oh, OK... They were good friends with your daughter. Yeah, I don't know. I thought that if you could ask your daughter if she knows something? I assume I can... make a phone call. Hi, I have one thing to ask - Are you still in contact with Maria? OK, that's a pity. Bye then. They are not in contact anymore. Thank you. Yeah, I should get back to things... It was nice to see you. Yeah, thanks, likewise. And you, have a really nice summer! Now... I want to speak with your daughter. You said that she is no longer in contact with Maikki. I would like to hear it from her. Can I have her phone number? We are actually eating right now. Let's not let that ruin our pleasant evening. Let's have a drink. Have a good summer everyone. - You too, thanks for inviting us. Damn it! Leena, come away. Should we call the police? - Let's see if she leaves. We should probably call, just in case. There she goes. Hi. I quit. Okay... Why? I never changed the thermostats. I've been sleeping in stairwells. Last night I slept in an apartment. Had a bath in the morning. I cannot stay here. And why was it you came here? To look for my daughter! - Did you find her? No! - And now you are leaving?! Yes! Right... MOTHER CALLING SILENT Reverse is in the right top corner, lift up the lever. Handbrake is here. The tank is now full, return it full. Any questions? - No. Drive safely! - Thank you. Hello? This is from the central hospital, Kalle there? - Yeah... Kalle? - Yes. Yeah... I am sorry to tell you that - your mother died. She jumped from the balcony... I am terribly sorry. I guess you expect to get paid for these days? Yeah... The situation is that right now I don't have money to pay. Let's do so that I will find you a place to sleep - And you stay for one more week or until I can get the money. Hi! Hello, hello... Eeva, this is my dad. Dad, this is Eeva. I tried to call you. Wanted to ask if you want garlic bread or herb bread. Your list says "flavoured bread”. Who would ever want herb bread? Eeva will be staying in the room upstairs for a while. - No she will not. I have promised Eeva a place to sleep. I am Finland's best detective. Fuck you lesbian, I know what's going on! And no name calling then, behave yourself. Do you have a list? - I do. I cannot stay here. Coffee? Need a cup of coffee. - Thank you... Dad, make some coffee! I will not! I read once an article. That said that... Family murderers have had... Low blood sugar... When they have decided to kill their family. Should you... Have eaten... A chocolate bar? So that nobody would have died. But you didn't kill your whole family... So maybe that doesn't apply here. Have you thought about this? How is Maikki? She has had a fairly good life - without you. It would not be right for you to impose on her life now. Hasse... I have no idea where my child is. My own child! We were... We were 17 when we had... Mikael. I even planted that cherry tree - After your wedding. Could I at least call her? Excuse me. Does your mother's name happen to be Eeva Lindström? Nope. Your name is not Maria? - Sorry. It's just that you look exactly like her. OK. You cannot be so selfish that you won't go and see her! What do you want? - That you go see your mother. She has been looking for you and she wants to meet you. You can go see her. She's been in prison for about a hundred years! And you won't go and see her?! Maybe you don't want her to be your mother, But you are her child. She killed my dad. If you have an opportunity like this - you will take it. - Fuck! You will now get your fancy butt into the moody hospital - And introduce yourself to her. - You go and fuck yourself. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Was I abused? You two were fighting... I wanted to help you... But you told me to run. And I did. And then I never saw him again. By the way, Hasse died. Had a blood clot in the heart and died. I told... Mikael. That I would take Maikki and go. I will take Maikki and go” ”You cannot do anything” ”And you will never see her again” It was my fault... I was so angry. Mikael strangled me and... Maikki stabbed him. Back, neck... I took the knife away... She had such small hands. I'm sorry. Why don't you say anything? Why don't you say anything? Can't you speak? Hey... Are you alright? Yes. There you go. If you thank me, I'll take it back. Translation for the subtitles: Jaana Shelby
