Hi, Chuck. How are ya? - Hi, Emma. - Hey, man. - Nice seeing you again. - Good to see you. - How you been, boy? - Fine. You take the big one. Hey, Chuck, ain't Emma kinda old for that long walk home? This time she doesn't walk back but rides back in style like a lady. - Wanna bet? - I'll bet you and you. - You got yourself a bet. - I'll take you out. I'll take a piece of that. - Jake, how are you? - Hi, Chuck. Good luck to you. Thanks very much. I'll see you around, right. - Don't catch a cold, honey. - Oh, Chuck. - Chuck! - Jay! How are you, honey? - Oh, you're back. - Ha ha. Hi, Chuck. Back for your yearly shellacking? Not me, haven't you heard, this year I'm gonna win. - Hi, Ned. - Chuck! 'Hit me.' Lady Darlene, when you already got the 19 you don't say, "Hit me." Well, the cards are face-down. How do you know I've got 19? How I know I don't know, but I know. Take my advice, don't take. Hit me. Hm! Hmph! It's not the losing that bothers them it's the pity they can't stand. Chuck, you're back. Answer me quick a question. How is the mama? The mama, she's got an Italian boy haircut. But she's not an Italian and she's not a boy. How does she look? Honor thy mother and thy father. I'm not talking. - It's a pleasure to see you. - Warm me up. Can't you ever come in and not losing your shirt? - Go, lull a little baby pool. - Deal. - No. - Deal. No, you have to get killed. Go find a stranger. Should I report you to the manager? - 'Why not? Here I am.' - Hiya, Tom. Having trouble with the help, Chuck? No, he's just saving me from myself. In your case, I don't blame him. But every time the house stands to make a dime on anyone Uncle Lonely Heart starts suffering. 'Mr. Culdane.' We have a reservation, but the people in our room haven't moved out yet and there are no other vacancies. - We just got married. - Shh. Well, it won't be long. Go have drink on the house while you're waiting. We only got two days. Here's all this time-- Shh. You don't have to tell everybody everything. Alright, Mr. Culdane, am I fired? Yes or not? Not. Only stop helping the customers, will you? It antagonizes them. - Well, good luck. - Thanks, Tom. Say, honey, hold my hand a little will you, just for luck? Mr. Culdane, now may I talk to you about my little girl? - When you hear her-- - Another time, please, Guz. I was due in the court room an hour ago. You dance like that opening night and I guarantee you will kill the people. Thank you. Mr. Culdane, may I talk to you for a moment? Oho, an hour, all day. I don't want to be difficult but must the waiters work during the rehearsal? It's a little distracting. Boys! Knock it off till the rehearsal is over. There now, you see how easy that was? - Thank you. - I should've thought of it. Some artists like to get used to the noise they run into during the actual performances. Noise? What noise, Mr. Culdane? Just the usual noise of people having dinner. While I'm dancing, people will be eating? After all, how much noise do people make eating? Munching celery , drinking soup, talking. Oh, no, Mr. Culdane. I'm sorry, it's impossible. There's nothing I can do about it. You can speak to the owners, can't you? Miss Corvier, the owners are businessmen. You say, "Art" to them, they say, "Art who?" No, but all they know about is making money and money they make from people. And people while they're catching up for sure like to eat. You see? And what does that make me? An extra dish? Oh, honey, it makes you just about the highest-priced dish in history. Hmph! Miss Corvier, artists like you with ethics and $30,000 a week for two weeks.. Y-you're not thinking about walking out? I left this country when I was 13 so I can't tell you what I'm thinking. I never learned the words in English. - Ah! - 'Maria.' Hold my hand, honey, just for luck. Just a second, baby, relax. 'Seven, red.' Why, you great big beautiful doll. That's not a hand, that's a rabbit's foot. And you're a bunny rabbit. Let me go, you idiot. Why, bunny? Will! That's the worst-tempered bunny I ever ran into. Aha. A slot machine in my bedroom. People eating while I dance. And now this... this imbecile grabbing my hand, calling me names. This imbecile, he was quite good-looking. What difference does that make? To me it would make. What time is Pierre calling? I wanna get out of this place. How could he have booked such a thing? I never heard of it-- Oh, a gift maybe from the management? No, Mr. Rodwell. Chuck Rodwell. He says it's the rabbit's share of the profits. - What? - He says that.. Oh, don't give it back, Maria. It's money. Excuse me, ma'am I wonder if you'd introduce me to Miss Corvier. My dear boy, I'm afraid your timing is very wrong. ♪ Who do you think I'm gonna see ♪ ♪ The gal with the yaller shoes ♪ ♪ The gal with the yaller shoes ♪ ♪ And the golden hair ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody like her ♪ ♪ Fiddle up, fiddle up ♪ ♪ Fiddlin' man ♪ ♪ I'm aimin' to have this dance ♪ ♪ With the gal with the yaller shoes ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody like her ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody like her ♪ ♪ Ain't' nobody like ♪ ♪ The gal with the yaller shoes ♪ ♪ Diddly dum bum ♪♪ Sorry, that was an accident. What I came to say is thank you for the tip, Mr. Rodwell but I don't want it! What I do want is for you to stop bothering me. I hope I make myself entirely clear! Uh, look, baby.. Stop calling me baby or honey or bunny. - I don't know your name. - I don't want you to. Okay, I don't have to. I'm not trying to bother you. I won a lotta money when you held my hand. - You held my hand. - Alright, I held your hand. You can't think that's why you won. - Well, I certainly can. - That's ridiculous. Alright, so it's ridiculous. But since I am that ridiculous I thought I oughta share the winnings with you. You don't have to agree with me, but what're you so mad about? I can see you being annoyed, but why should you be boiling? I'm not quite sure. Mr. Rodwell, I owe you an apology. I am angry, but I see now, it isn't you. - I'm very sorry. - No hard feelings. Anybody I can poke in the eye for you? It'd have to be my eye, so no thanks. All of a sudden I can't believe you got lucky. Lotzi, do you believe in witches? Certainly, why? You met one? Her? The ballerina? You're barking up the wrong witch. It's Pierre, I'm telling him what's what and he's already aging ten years. Pierre, you know I never criticize the engagements that you make for me, but this one is a mistake. At $30,000 a week it can't be a mistake. Not if you want a New York opening. Darling, it's impossible for me come out there. Just this once you'll have to deal with the problems yourself. Ah, it isn't so difficult. It isn't as if you had to be cooperative and reasonable like a normal human being. You're a ballerina. You're not supposed to be normal. Nobody is normal in Las Vegas. When you arrive do they send you champagne to make you welcome? No, they send you a slot machine 'with the compliments of the management.' They don't know you, but they talk to you. They call you honey, they call you bunny, they make jokes.. I am being aloof. There's no one to be aloof from. Maria, are you talking about people? Since when do you have anything to do with people? When you're not on the stage working you should be in your room resting. Now remember that and nothing will upset you. Nothing will happen to you at all. Forgive me, but I'm in the middle of a costume rehearsal. I'm sorry, you'll have to stay. Pierre says we have to stay. Pierre says, Pierre says, says, says. Since you are 14, Pierre is always saying. Isn't it time you say a few words yourself? You're the one who's always saying "Listen to Pierre. A ballerina shouldn't think." I know. It must be Las Vegas. I'm reacting to it very peculiar. It's reminding me of Monte Carlo and my youth. And what a youth. But about that you would not know, poor thing. If you mean those archdukes and millionaires buzzing around you like bees, I ought to know. You've told me often enough. And from my telling, did you learn something? Here you are sitting like a wallflower. Is anyone buzzing? I don't want anyone buzzing. - Then why do you work so hard? - Because I love to dance. Yeh, what a reason. Why'd you work so hard when you were a ballerina? Everything I did in mine whole life being a ballerina, marrying three managers in a row everything, I had only one reason, men. I am loving men. I can't see what's so lovable about them. Of course not. I'm wasting mine time. To blind man how can you talk about color. Yeh. 15, black. - Sorry, Chuck. - Oh, honey, I enjoyed it. - You sure know how to lose. - Just takes a little practice. - Well, better luck next time. - Thanks, hon. They paged us, but you were so busy gambling you didn't hear and they gave the room away. So there! If she gets madder, having that room won't do you any good. Huh? Oh. Psst! Psst! Yes? No, no, no. Just him. 'Just my friend. The big-time gambler.' Congratulations, speedy. I'm hearing you're losing all your money the first day this year instead of the second. I've still got 20 bucks and the car. But you never sell the car till the last minute. Just what minute do you think this is? - Why don't you stop already? - Why should I? There's nothing wrong with me that holding one good hand wouldn't fix. Lotzi, did you hear what I said? I said a mouthful. I've been holding the wrong hands, that's all. Come in. Come in. Come in. Yes, Mr. Rodwell? I was wondering, would you consider having dinner with me? Thank you, but Madam Hatvany and I are having dinner here. Hi. Sit down. Don't be bashful. Start buzzing. Where are you going? When I'm coming back, I'll be making a report. She thinks you oughta go out with me. What's the point in being in Las Vegas if you just stay in your room? It makes no difference where I am. When I'm not working, I rest. And when I'm not resting, I work. Well, uh, what do you do for fun? Ooh! Dancing is fun. Oh, well, I-I mean, besides that. There isn't any besides that. Well, don't you ever fe...feel the need for a little excitement? Oh, I suppose everyone does from time to time. Well, what do you do about that? I take a cold shower. - Is there anything else? - I'm not doing very well, am I? I'm sorry, thank you anyway. Maybe I'd do better if I came clean. I got a hunch about you. I think you're lucky for me. You see, I was losing all day long...except twice. Twice I held your hand, twice I won. - That's coincidence. - What if it isn't? What if every time I hold your hand I win? - That'd be pretty interesting. - Interesting? It'd be a miracle. We'd make ourselves a fortune too, wouldn't we? Let's go to the gambling casino and try it out. Go on to the.. You expect me to go trotting from table to table with you holding your hand? When an opportunity like this comes along-- What opportunity? This isn't a fact, this hunch of yours-- Just test it. It'll take you a minute. You won't even have to change your clothes. There's a one arm band, uh, slot machine just inside the lobby. Now, all we've gotta do is go over there and try it. Couldn't we use the one in my bedroom? You've got a slot machine in your bedroom? Yes. Oh, sister, you're really great. Come on. In the entire history of Las Vegas I think that's the first time anyone ever hit two jackpots in a row on the same machine. It'll take me just ten minutes to get dressed. What if the one in my bedroom was out of order? We'll find out. That's all there is to find out with. Until you're sure, you won't bet it all, will you? - All isn't very much. - It is, if it's all you have. In the first place, I'll add $20-- No dice. You put up the hand, I put up the money. Then we split the winnings even-Steven. Alright, but first you bet $1. Uh-uh, I have a reputation to maintain. A reputation for what? Winning or losing? You bet $1 all by yourself. If you lose, you'll bet another one holding somebody else's hand to see if you need me. Then I'll try, first alone, then with someone else. Because I may not need you. Cutting me out already, huh? Then we try together, $1 three times. If we win three times in a row well, then, we must admit there's more to this than meets the eye. That is quite an ambition. - Chuck? - Eh, just dollar chips. - Dollar? - I'm teaching her the game. Now, let's see, first I bet a dollar alone. Mm-hmm. Seven. 17, black. Now, holding somebody else's hand. Right. Hold my hand, honey, will you, just for luck? Luck. 19, red. Wanna try again, baby? He hasn't the time, thank you anyway. Excuse me, I didn't know you had your nurse with you. Bunny, let me do my own brushing off, will you? I beg your pardon. My turn. Uh-huh. 20, black. Grab yourself a hand. I can't. I can't just go up to a stranger.. I don't drink. Hold my hand, will ya, honey, just for luck? For any reason you want. - What's your name? - Oh, I don't know. Yes, it's so hot and stuffy in here I can hardly remember my own. It's alright. Why don't we go to the bar and talk it over? '17, black.' Thank you so much. Hey, the bar is that way. The bar, you remember, where we were gonna have a drink and find out who you are? Alright, buster, take off. You heard her. Oh, I see. Sorry. I must have had her confused with someone else. You're pretty fast worker, bunny. Don't be silly. Are we ready? All I need is the rabbit's foot. - Twenty? - Mm-hmm. Twenty. '20, black.' - Two to go, right? - Right. - Twenty. - Mm-hmm. Repeater. I don't think I can stand. Take it easy, darling. - Twenty again? - Mm-hmm. Twenty. Twenty again! You great big beautiful doll. 'This is you, isn't it, Chuck?' I, oh, I'm sorry. I.. It was just that I.. It's quite understandable. What do you say, Chuck? You're gonna try again? Yeah, again and again and again. Let's go someplace to sit down. - Now? - There's a lot to think about. Like what, for heaven's sakes? Like...like having dinner, I'm hungry. I guess if we gotta keep any strength in that hand I better feed you. Cash them in. The next thing we gotta do is to move on to another club. Since you're working here it'd be more tactful if we broke somebody else's bank. I thought you were hungry. I was, but now I'm not. And that's funny 'cause I've been hungry every day for ten years. That's terrible. Suddenly I feel there are many terrible things about the way I've been living. We gotta clean up as much as possible, tonight. We got this fairy godmother. Who knows how long she'll stick around. Oh, I don't know. She picked us out, didn't she? She must have something in mind. Never look a fairy godmother in the mouth, I always say. As long as we got her, let's use her. Like now. Chuck, could we stay and see the performance, please? I've never been in a nightclub before. Bunny, you baffle me. I thought all you ballerinas lived a real gay life. Well, I've just found out we don't. That's why it's so nice just sitting here with you. 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.'

And there's something to be said for it too. What's the matter, don't you like it? It's very different from dancing on the stage. - Makes me feel odd, like.. - Like what? Like having a cold shower. Let's win some money. I thought you'd never say it. - What do you say, boss? - What do I say? I say I want another man on the wheel. Ladies and gentlemen, time out for just a minute. Five croupiers in an hour. What's the matter, Charlie? You're turning chicken? Poor little fellow, got a pain in your wallet. Can't let the man get used to paying out, friends. It might get to be a habit. Same number. 'Same number.' 'Ten, black.' Ten. Oh! Sorry, Charlie, I thought it was the maid. Listen, Kelly, Do you know Chuck Rodwell? Yeah, he's a wonderful guy, shame he has no luck. You don't say. That wonderful guy with no luck is over the tables killing me. Chuck Rodwell? Well that's a miracle, Charlie. I'm on the wrong side of the miracle, so, come on. Wait. Come on where? What do you want from me? What do you think? I want you to get him away from the table. - How? - Kelly, I'm not a girl. I dunno how girls make guys do things and stop doing things. But girls know how. And the last I heard, you were a girl. No, I don't want to. I don't think it's nice. - Isn't nice? - Mm-mm. He's got already got so much, he'll have to truck it out. - Is that nice? - I don't care, I like Chuck. And I don't like you. Well that leaves only one question. How do you like your job? - Let's stop for a while. - What for? Yeah, for what? I'm sorry. I thought it'd be fine to have a little fun, you know. Talk, or dance, or...talk. We can do that any old time. Kelly! You've been here all day and didn't look me up! 'That's to show you what you missed.' 'Why d'you care what I missed?' 'Because you're making a fortune.' You're a little doll. With some money, you'll be a big doll. Is that enough? Oh, Chuck, to put it simply, I'm mad about you. Besides, I wanna learn your system. You can meet my system. Maria, this Kelly Donavan, an old friend of mine. This is Maria Corvier. Hi. - Ballerina? - Mm-hmm. Well, aren't you stepping into the big time? Dancing girls on both sides. It's a dream I have quite often. Look, beautiful dreamer, now that you're loaded I'm not gonna let you out of my sight. - Isn't she wonderful? - Isn't she? Look, sweetie. I have to give what my agent laughingly calls a performance. So you two should drop over to the Silver Slipper and lead the applause? If you bring your money with you I may sit at your table later. - 'Promise?' - Mm-hmm. We'll cash in our chips, and we'll be there. - Chuck, promise me? - Mm-hmm. Anyway, Maria wanted to quit, didn't you? - But you didn't. - Yeah, now I do. Besides, we're off to a good start so we can walk out fine. I couldn't have planned it better. Oh, come on, honey.

What were you thinking of, you and Pierre to let me live this long and be this ignorant? - Ignorant about what? - About men. Half the human race, that's all. Maria, darling. Begin from the beginning. - What happened? - Nothing happened. I'm a failure. I'm worse than a failure. I'm invisible. A man could sit with me. Dance with me. Talk with me. Even kiss me. And not even see me. He talked to you, danced with you kissed you, and you say nothing happened? - Yey. - Nothing happened. It's my hand he's interested in. Not me. Shame it isn't detachable. A little snip comes along who walks like this. And he goes. Ten elephant come along who dance like.. ...that. And he goes, "Ah ha ha ha!" And when I do the very same thing he doesn't even see me. - So, you like him? - Like him? Yes, I like him. Not that there's anything so remarkable about him. With all the millions of men in the world how can any one be so remarkable? Not that I would've chosen to like him. Yes, I like him. So, he's calling. - What could be more convenient? - Don't answer it. I have nothing to say to him. But you just said you liked him. To like a man who can't even see you isn't sensible. To like a man who can't even see you doesn't mean you can't hate him. Hello? No, it is not Bunny. She's here, Bunny. But she, her, this is not her. You are following? She's not wanting to talk to you. Look, darling. Me, you do not have to convince. I'm talking to you. She's not. Wait a minute. I'll see what's what. Yoy! My boy, she's taking a cold shower. What this means, I cannot begin to tell you. But for you, it is not good. Chuck. Chuck, I'm hearing you and the ballerina you were cleaning up like two brooms. - Yeah. - Oh, you're so used to it. You are bored already. She's so mad, she won't even talk on the telephone. I dunno what I did to hurt her feelings. - Huh, I've got problems. - This everyone has. But besides problems, you've got money and this you never had. Let me see it. Let me feast my eyes. Oh, Lotzi, it's four o'clock in the morning. Let me look. It wouldn't tire me. - Oh. - Yeah, but it is hers. - Oh. - You know something, Lotzi. - Aye aye aye! - She's an awfully nice girl. A dope and his money are soon parted. I'm keeping this until tomorrow. I'm not going to gamble anymore tonight. I can't without her. I wanna go up there. Look, I'm making a deal. May my boss, Mr. Culdane, drop dead. If I'm not giving you the money tomorrow. Okay, Lotzi. You win. I'll see you in the morning. "High flying Ballerina stops the show" "at Silver Slipper." People eating while you're dancing. That disturbs you. Uh, doing publicity pictures by the pool, that was vulgar. But getting crocked in the saloon and going like this.. ...oh, that's art, that's high class. It's-it's just dandy. I told you, I'm sorry. What do you want her to do to prove it? Something ridiculous? If it'd get her outta my sight, yes. When I think what I've done for you. That-that ridiculous salary, you-you're own personal slot machine, giving in to you right and left. Left and right. Can you please get in touch with my manager? I got in touch with him before the sun was up. You know what he had to gall to claim? He said that what you did had no effect on your contract. Is that one for the book? I don't care. We're leaving on the next plane. - That's perfectly alright. - It is here Madam Hatvani. - I'll call, I'll get the plane. - Tom Culdane is also here. And you are welcome to him. You are sure. Yes, yes, what is it? They are? How-How many? That many. Yes, I see. Tell them I'll be right over. Oh-h-h-h. A beautiful morning. Seven owners of the Sands are here. Two more than there have ever been together at one time. And they want to see me. Guess why? Therefore these are my parting words. Get packed. Oh. Mr. Culdane-- I know you love your lil' girl. But there's a time and place. I just wanted to tell you the owners are waiting. Oh, thank you. You're-you're very kind. Good morning gentlemen, I think I know what you're gonna say. Here's that genius with a giant brain. He thought I was gonna fire him for hiring the Ballerina. We oughta get down on our knees and apologize. He'd rather have a bonus, eh? Look at 'em. Nine o'clock in the morning. 'It's better than the hottest Saturday night we ever had.' Where ever that Ballerina is, that's where they want to be. Oh, the girl's having luck was an accident. But to publicize it by arranging the Silver Slipper caper? That was pure genius. - Yes. - How'd you think of it? Well, there's more to my job than just seeing that the waiters have clean shirts. Good morning, friends. Some of the boys wanted me to have a little chat with you. So, chat. Thanks to Mr. Slob Cludane, an employee of the Sands became a public benefactor last night at every place but the Sands. We took quite a shellacking. But I'm not here to complain. I'm here to discuss a matter of principle. The principle of gambling which is based on the element of chance. Right? But when that Ballerina of yours comes to the table there isn't any element of chance. Right? So, it isn't gambling, right? - So get out injunction. - We got a better idea. Get rid of her. Send her to Mexico. Send her to Reno. Let her break their banks. Get her outta Vegas. We've got the little lady for two weeks, haven't we? With an option for a third? Well, you trod up and see her right now. Tell her we love her and use our option for the third week. - And more if we can get them. - I'm on my way. Remember, Tom. We're holding you personally responsible for the little girl's happiness. Every minute she's in Las Vegas. Oh. Chuck, haven't you got a heart? - I-It might mean my bonus. - You won't stay here? Even my job. It's a little thing for me to ask that you ask her. I'm not asking her anything. Her wanting to quit is her business. Between the papers and your reaction, I don't blame her. Chuck, now buddy, three years ago, when you went broke who brought you car for list price? - You're wasting your time. - And two years ago. When you were in trouble with those outta town sharpies? - Who squared it? And then-- - Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get the money from Lotzi. Then I'm gonna see Maria and give her her half. I'm gonna thank her for winning me my half. Then, I'm gonna apologize for getting her into this mess. And then I'm gonna say goodbye. I'm going to my rehearsal whether you like-- - Look-- - Be quiet, Mr. Culdane. The only thing that could possibly keep me from opening here would be my deciding not to. Not your deciding anything. If I made a fool of myself last night, why shouldn't I? If I wanna Can-Can down Main Street, or gamble with him or not gamble with him, why shouldn't I? Let's get this straight, Mr. Culdane. What I do or I don't do, depends entirely on me. Man, that's no bunny, that's a tiger. Well, whatever she is, she's gonna have me. Well, I think I'll go in and pick up my bonus. Gus. Gus, I hear your little girl is just loaded with talent. Why didn't you tell me man? It's my department. I'll audition her right after the Ballet rehearsal, alright? Uh, Mr. Culdane. You're sure you didn't get fired? Fired? - Ah, if it isn't lucky Chucky. - And happy good morning to you. You're having a fine night's sleep, I hope. Wonderful, I spent the night with Emma. Don't worry girls. It's a horse, Emma. Now that you've got my good name cleared up may I have the money, please? - What money? - Quit kidding, I'm in a hurry. Who's kidding? And also who's got the money? What do you mean who's got the money? I mean, it's gone, mine boy. By special messenger straight to your mamma. You told me you'd give it back the minute I asked for it, you promised. Who believes a Hungarian promise? Just to show you I'm a sport. Here, mine boy. Mine boy, I'll get back to you later in spades. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. Funny place to be looking for me. Why? I found you, didn't I? 'Let's all be on stage and ready for rehearsal at six o'clock.' That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Thought you didn't care about ballet. That's what I thought too. But I was wrong. I suppose you want to gamble? Well, if you'd like to, and you're not busy. I am busy. I'm very busy. If it's convenient later on, which I rather doubt I'll get in touch with you. I'll pick you up right here in 15 minutes. Well, so long, old horse. It's been real nice knowing you. - Where are you going? - I've been outclassed. I can't take the competition. I didn't know there was any. You think we tell you guys everything? Okay fellows, the curtain. Bring out those screens. Alright, Gus. Bring on your little doll. Well, what do you know? She really is a doll. Well, she's awfully cute, Gus. But she can't speak English and I don't know-- She can't speak it, but she can sing it. Listen. - Mitsuko? - Hmm? - She said you scare her. - That's ridiculous. I love little kitty. She'll sing. She'll sing. - You know, "lucky charm"? - Sure. "Lucky charm", boys. Hold it there, Pete. Pete, just a second. Pete, would you mind playing piano? Yeah, sure. And Pete, slow and easy, okay? - Okay? - Now you sit right up here. Now you sing with me, huh?

'I think we can use her.' You know something? You look positively beautiful. I look exactly the way I looked last night. Well then, you must have looked beautiful last night too. Hi, you two. What's it going to be, blackjack or roulette? We've fixed up a private room, so you can gamble all by yourselves without anyone annoying you. And without anyone betting along with us. What are you, philanthropists? You gotta win for everyone? Come on, I'll show you. When we want to gamble we'll tell you. It isn't compulsory, is it? Anytime you need me, Ms. Corvier. I'm yours. Nothing like winning a couple of bucks for turning a nice guy into a crank. Why is he taking it for granted that we just wanna gamble? Why shouldn't he? You're a gambler, aren't you? - You're always gambling. - Sure, I'm in Las Vegas. If I were at a pool, I'd be swimming. That doesn't mean I make it my life's work, does it? Well, no. The truth is, I don't know anything about you, do I? Except that when we hold hands something happens. That a pretty good place to start from, isn't it?. If you'd like to know more, it could be arranged. Alright, arrange it. With that name, this must have something to do with you. Well, on all my bank loans it says Rancher. I wondered last night when I was thinking about you. How you managed to stay so healthy looking spending all your time in gambling rooms. I was thinking about you last night, too. It's so big. You must be very rich. I own a lot. But what I own doesn't usually include money. Chuck, aren't you any good at ranching? Well, I have a diploma from an agricultural college. That says I am. Then why don't you make money at it? I do. If you make it, why don't you have it? I lose it. Not all of it, just the profits I take to Las Vegas. You mean you gamble it away? But why? I like gambling. You liked gambling last night too, didn't you? Well, yes, but we were winning. You're always losing. Well, bunny, if you like gambling that includes winning and losing. It's hard to explain. It must be, it doesn't make sense. No, that's right, it doesn't. You know, cards, roulette, dice, they don't care whether you're a nice guy or a louse. Whether you're a scientific player with a system or just a superstitious bum like me. And that's what I like about it. There are no rules and there are so many rules about everything. You know, if you work hard, you'll make money. If you don't work hard, you go broke. You plant alfalfa, you get alfalfa. What's wrong with that? Well, that leaves out all the surprises, like you. Now where does a rancher type guy like me meet up with a ballerina like you? Now that, that's like planting alfalfa and getting violets. It's beautiful, so quiet, so peaceful after Las Vegas. No people. No people. Aren't there any people here at all? It's a house rule. Nobody works while the boss is away. They wouldn't anyway, so why should I make them feel guilty? Bunny, these are my so called helpers. This is Scotty, Joe, Peep, Whitey, Buck, Horrible, Slim. And Lee, our chef. - Hi. - Fellows this is Maria Corvier. - Is she the one with the hand? - Yes, she's the one.. What do you guys gotta pipeline to Vegas? I'll take on anyone at anytime on any day. If you'll pardon the expression, what's cooking? Half a beef in the barbeque pit. Company? She played bingo at the church last night and won 70 cents. She got so carried away, she invited the whole congregation for dinner. - How is she? - Cranky. - Where is she? - In the hen house. - Telling off the hens. - Well, who is she? She is Miss Hattie, my old lady. A very disagreeable type. You mean, you're talking about your mother? Yes, but don't say it in such reverent tones. She ain't Whistler's mother, she's mine. You'll see. - Whitey, take care of the car. - Hope I see you again. - Yes, ma'am. I hope so ma'am. - Boys. Oh, Bunny, one thing, if mother gets fresh just talk back. - You think she won't like me? - It isn't that. She just doesn't like girls. At least she hasn't yet. I suppose there have been great many...girls, I mean. - Hmm. - What doesn't she like? Well, she has no use for what she calls modern youth. - Too wild for her? - Oh, no, too tame. Oh. And you call yourself a hen. You can do it if you put your mind to it. You foul foul. You haven't been able to bully Teresa into laying eggs for years, you're not gonna start now. Another one? Behave yourself. This is Maria Corvier. If I'm not broke, thank her. I heard. The girl with the golden mitts. - Yeah. - Hi, Mrs. Rodwell. - Howdy. - She leant that in the movies. I'm glad to know you. A dancing girl, huh? He always goes for them just like his dad. Just like his paw,you mean. Stay in character. I stand corrected. How often do you take them for a walk? We don't. Their feet never touch the ground. Never in their whole lives? The poor things. What a ranchers wife you'd make. Come on, we'll give you the guided tour. When you've seen Teresa, you've seen our worst. Don't let her get to you, ma. Don't give her the satisfaction. What's with Daisy, Slim? She gonna have a calf? No, the vet looked her over this morning. Said she dreamed the whole thing up. Never saw such emotional cow. Remember when I delivered the last one? Even after it was born she wouldn't believe it. You deli.. You mean yourself? Yes, when you live in a place like this you develop some mighty odd talents. "What a ranchers wife I'd make" is right. When my cat had kittens, I fainted Daisy's gonna be a maw. Yippee! Yippee, Daisy's gonna be a mom. It's a girl. It's a girl. - Who? - Daisy. - Daisy? - Daisy? Let's see. What's that hole in the ground over there? Just what you said. A hole in the ground. But with that pile we'll make in Las Vegas tonight. I think I can make it bigger. With maybe little oil at the bottom. Maybe we can get to 100 feet with that money Lotzi sent you. The money Lotzi sent who? Didn't you get some money from Las Vegas this morning? I didn't get anything from any place this morning. Why that dirty double dealing Hungarian dealer. Bunny, did you.. Be careful. What was that about the money you were gonna make gambling? You don't believe that dribble about holding hands, do you? It's true. We don't know why, but it always works. Anyone would tell Chuck has no brains but for a sensible girl like you.. Oh, oil! Oh, I can't believe it. I don't know what it is, but it's incredible! Alright go on in. What a wife she'd make for a rancher. Hmm-mm. Mother, I've told you. I've known her 24 hours. That's only one day. Yes, in that day, the hens have laid a year's supply of eggs. A cow with an ailment diagnosed as indigestion has had a calf. Not to mention a well without a pump that hollered "Dig me. I've got oil!" Oh, don't bicker, son. The evidence is piling up. Well, what are you gonna do about her? Do I usually do anything about a girl I've known 24 hours? - Yep. - Well, maybe. But bunny's different. She kind of special. Anyway, it's ridiculous to talk about it. She's an artist and she's got a certain kind of future-- Yes, and she's got a hand that'll do no good without your hand holding it. Do you think that if we really liked each other it would matter whether we had the luck or not? I don't know, Chuck. I just got sort of fascinated with the idea that if you did like each other, you'd have the luck too. That's pretty mercenary, isn't it? I don't know. I'm taking her to Las Vegas before I get any ideas. Seems to me you could stay for dinner. What fancy ideas could you get while you're eating? Well, it'd be different if it wasn't a barbecue. But, you get out there with the fire and the guitars, moon light and the stars and you know me. No, no. I am taking her back to Las Vegas. Honey, do you think you could possibly stay for dinner? Oh, yes. I called Sari and cancelled the rehearsals. Say, that's a pretty good fit. I may never take it off. I thought she was built like grandma the minute I saw her. - She was a big gal too. - Mother. - Hmm? - Bunny's gonna stay for dinner. Good. In that case, I'm glad it's a barbecue. - Aren't you hungry, Chuck? - No. That's funny 'cause I'm always hungry. There must be some explanation. - Do you ever get fat? - Not so far. I don't think you ever will. Grandma never did. It isn't every day that a man meets a girl who reminds his own mother of his own grandmother. Hey, boss, let's set up. I'll be right there. Excuse me. I hear that in your own line you're pretty important. Promising, the critics say, that's all. Ever think of givin' it up? - No. - Good for you. I never could stand the kind of women that hanker to be a housewife. You like my boy? - Yes. - Got any plans for him? Well, I haven't wanted to think too much about him. 'Why not? What are you scared of?' That we probably haven't too much in common. Oh, I don't know. If you live with a man long enough have a few quarrels and a few worries not to mention anything else that might come along get a sunburn with him and have the flu with him you're bound to end up havin' somethin' in common. - Ms. Hattie. - 'Hmm.' I thought you didn't like girls. It's been 20 years since I've seen a girl who eats like you.

O-oh, goodness! - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. How lucky you are living here. You really like it, don't you? I really love it. - No, ballet on the ranch. - No, barbeque in the theater. The great way to live would be six months on the ranch and six months wherever the ballet is. That would be a great way to live. Maria, you're just talking or do you know what you're saying? I know what I'm saying. I just don't know where it's going. I do. Let's get married right away. Well, that's what you had in mind, isn't it? No, I just had in mind.. ...that I love you. I thought that was enough for now. Well, that's not enough for me 'cause I love you too. I'm old fashioned. ♪ Ta-da ta-da-da da-da-dum ♪ ♪ Ta-da-Dada da-da-da da dum ♪ Oh, Sari, have I got things to tell you. Yes, you are right it's me. But why do you look so horrified? Yesterday, on the telephone you begged me to come. I'm surprised that's all, since you told me you couldn't come. Well, as a ballerina you didn't need me. But as a burlesque queen in the gamblers' mall I thought you might. - Yes, I know everything. - No. No one knows everything expect me. And I may or I may not tell you. Ah, Maria, why you trying to fight with me? I didn't come to scold. If you made a little gossip it turns out it's good for business. And if you've met a nice young man and amused yourself why should it bother me? That's right. It shouldn't, should it? - And it doesn't, darling. - I'm so glad you said that. It may sound silly, but I've been so worried how to tell you. How to tell me what, my big baby? That I'm going to marry Chuck. You are going to what? - Well, then-- - No, no. Don't say it again. You, you, chaperone. Who said marry? All I wanted was she should fall in love a little. You can't fall in love a little. You either do or you don't. I did and it's wonderful. - With that cowboy? - With that cowboy. And I didn't know cowboy was a dirty word. We'll spend six months on the ranch and six months with the ballet and we're going to be happy. It's his grandmother's, I love it. I know everything you're going to say, so don't. I've known him only one day, that's all it took. No, we don't seem to have anything in common What we have in common is none of your business. It doesn't make sense, but we don't have to make sense because if we can make a fortune every time we hold hands who needs to make sense. You mean it's true about the luck? Oh, yes, it's true, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that Chuck and I are going to celebrate. You're not going to say a single word about it. Not even a little word like congratulations? Do you mean it? Sari, does he mean it? Well, in my long and enjoyable life I know plenty managers, but when the ballerina comes and says she is going to marry each and everyone, expect him have, at very least, a heart attack. Ah, but they were art lovers, I'm a businessman. And if two people can't lose together it is obvious to any businessman that they belong together. Oh, Pierre, you do mean it. Wait till you meet him. He'll be here in a minute. - I go to change. - May I join the celebration? 'I'll take the check and leave with the check.' Of course, after drinking your health in champagne if they have champagne in Las Vegas. They have everything in Las Vegas. Chuck, doll baby. Yes, it's doll baby, and nobody sent doll baby's mama nothin'. No money, not even an old post card. Chuck, if you're killing me here, people will talk. There's only one thing I've to say to you. Take good care of that money. You're not wanting it for gambling? Gamblin'? Ew, how dull. Hit me, you creep. So I'm coming. Did she tell you, Sari? Well, what do I get? Kiss or a freeze? I knew you'll be for it. Oh. Chuck, this is Maria's manager, Pierre Duval. This is the cowboy, him. - Thought you were in New York. - But I'm not. I know how you must feel. I know exactly what you want to say. Everybody knows exactly what I'm going to say. Don't say it for him, darling, he's on our side. Bunny, I don't know if I can stand the way you look. Now, let me get this straight, you mean, you're not against us? I'm a hard man with a dollar, but I'm going to buy you champagne tonight and that should prove something. He is a good guy, bunny. One has to know him a little better to apprec-ciate him. Don't mind, Sari. Once a ballerina, always a manager hater. Not me, not tonight, but isn't it time we started celebrating. I haven't stopped celebrating since we left the ranch. - Ranch gate to be exact. - These are the magic hands. I'm dying to see them in action. Can we, on our way? Not tonight. We don't want to gamble tonight, do we? Just one turn of the wheel for a man who is on your side. Let's make him a little money, it will only take a minute. And such a nice way to start an evening or end an evening or even spend an evening. Three red. Hey, here they come. Excuse us, please. Thank you. Hi! They're waiting for you. Hello, Chuck. How are you, Bill? We are just gonna make one bet. - I'm begging your pardon. - I'm begging your pardon. - Seventeen. - Seventeen - Seventeen. - It's on the seventeen. You're on. - Ten black. - Oh, no, we bet. - Ten! - Ten! Here, Chuck, here's some more money. No. You see, it has to be ours. That's what's wrong. We have to bet with our own money. He's wanting his money. I'm having it. - Don't giving it. - How not? He's bigger. I'll be right back. Quick, with the ballerina you'll find me Madam Hatvany. - My name is. - It's a pleasure to meet you. Goodbye. Hurry. Beat it. Kill me, you wouldn't get more. It's buried, the rest. - Seventeen again. - Seventeen. Yes, you are on seventeen, lady. Seven - Oh, no. - Oh, no. What happened? This is getting serious. Thirty four, red. What happened to our fairy godmother? She took a powder, that's all. She got us together, I guess she figured that's all she was supposed to do. We'll show her. We won't invite her to our party, right? - Right. - Right. I'm glad you're taking it this way. Well, why should we take it any other way? Doesn't make any difference to us, does it, bunny? No, darling. Only please don't call me bunny anymore, huh? Oh. Sorry, your luck ran out. That's the way it goes. You win till you lose then you lose. For that happy thought, here we are. Uh, just some wine. The Lo'sone '47. - Uh, you may clear this away. - Yes, sir.

Ladies and gentlemen, the management of The Sands Hotel, whose policy is "Drag him in, never mind how" has asked me to throw a little bait your way in the shape, and I say the very gorgeous shape of the star of our next show. The very beautiful ballerina, Maria Corvier! 'Miss Corvier.' Watch her face. Never saw a ballerina yet who didn't live on applause. Well, I've a few dull business things to discuss, but.. ...I'd be very understanding if you'd like to be alone. Oh, it's been a long day. I imagine you're a little tired, aren't you? A little. - You look tired too. - Yes. - Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight, darling. - See you in the morning? - Mm-hmm. Let's not talk about business or anything tonight. - I'm tired. - Of course, you are, my dear. You've been on a big, gay merry-go-round. You have to expect that it'll let down when the music stops. And it always does on merry-go-rounds. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Pierre, what happened? They lost. Your money, I know, I was peeking. But after what happened? They lost. But they had no more money to lose. Whatever they had, they lost. What's giving him that tired expression on the face? Oh, that's love, Lotzi. Love turned a little sour. You know, I think I'll start warming up. I have a hunch I'll be off the bench any minute. Hit me. That's fitting in exactly with my plans. Go home, wash out your mouth with soap. To an individual what is looking happy when another individual is looking unhappy I am not dealing. Boy, did you taunt her. Nice girl. But no heart. In my opinion no woman has heart until she's reaching say.. ...forty five? Say, fif.. Forty nine. Give a little, take a little. I'm bringing back the money, but I give you only his half. The way things are with them Dues I'll give myself. - The way things are with them? - Terrible. - Soon to be worse terrible. - Oh. Um, you're enjoying maybe a little blackjack? To play cards with a man, to me, it's a waste. If you are suggesting, for example little walk by the pool. Madam Hatvany. Be my guest. - Buy you a drink? - No, thanks. I have one. Besides I cost you enough tonight. Ah, forget it. I'm just sorry for your sake. Uh, scotch and water, please. - How's Maria? - A little depressed, like you. To be sure you can't lose and to find you can. It's enough to depress anybody. It wasn't the money, it was the magic. It really was like a fairytale, you know. We were under a spell and nothing mattered that really mattered. And the wheel turned to the wrong number and poof the spell was broken. Back to the cold, cold world where everything matters. It just takes a little getting used to, that's all. It doesn't change anything. We weren't so completely moonstruck that we didn't make a few sensible plans. I know. Six months here, six months there. Pierre, you've known Maria a long time, haven't you? Then you have probably given quite a bit of thought to us. Now, tell me, do you think it'll work? No. No, I don't think it'll work. Neither do you or you wouldn't have asked me. No, that's not true. I just want to make sure that Maria's happy on the ranch. Running barefoot, milking cows, picking eggs? She might be. But that still leaves the other six months when she's working. Will you be happy doing what? Well, I haven't given that much thought. You've given it lots of thought, Chuck. You just haven't come up with any answer. Will you mind if I keep trying? Oh, not at all. Try all you want and good luck to you. But, uh, do me a favor, Chuck. Could you please keep away from Maria tomorrow? She has to work and she won't be able to with you around. They're nervous creatures, ballerinas. You might as well get used to it. I imagine you'll take a little getting used to too. Oh. I won't give you any trouble. I'm a realist. Whatever Maria decides, I'll be for it. Well, that makes my evening. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Maria. - Good morning, darling. - Good morning. You're going to watch the rehearsal? Oh, no, I-I knew you'd be busy today so I thought I'd go on out to the ranch. There's nothing wrong, is there? At the ranch? Oh, no, no. It's just that there's a few things I gotta look after. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Chuck. It isn't going work, is it? No, darling. It isn't gonna work.
