Murat ! Murat ! Murat, it's noon already! Murat, get up or I'll cut your beard off! Murat, cut out the crap... DAY 1 October 3, 2001, Bremen ...however, German Unity Day still has a special significance for Germany, even if we're celebrating it today in the shadow of another date. 9/11 has shown us the dangers and threats facing freedom... Murat forgot his phone. Honey, do you know where he is? Maybe Attila knows. Do you know where Murat is? - Where do you think? Where he always is. Mom, telephone! Answer it! 1 saw Murat yesterday. - What about last night? It's Murat, he's in Frankfurt! - Murat? Frankfurt? Get outta here! Murat, where are you? Lunch is ready. Huh? What? Wait, he's babbling too loud. Say again, where are you, darling? You're doing what? No, Murat, you're to come home right now! I forbid it! Don't, Murat, please! Come home, your father isn't well. Really, 1 promise. Just ask Cem. Murat? RABIYE KURNAZ VERSUS GEORGE W. BUSH We'll have to say we want Quran lessons. otherwise he won't let us in. And then? - Get the headscarves out. Sister, are you crazy? Put it back in the bag. Are you insane? What are you planning? Do you know the guy? He's always going on about war in his mosque! Here it is. - Leave the knife, or I won't come! Do as you're told, you're younger than me. Will you stop saying that? Don't argue with me! - Come on! But promise you won't shout! - Alright, I promise. The courses for women and children are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Do you speak Arabic, sisters? No, not yet. Then come to Quran 1 on Tuesday. Any other questions? Well... I want Murat back. I'm Murat's mother. Which Murat? She means... - Murat Kurnaz. He's always here. Sorry, I don't know him. And Sedat? Sedat Bilmen? You don't know him either? No, I don't. Funny, you were at his place yesterday. Murat, too. You were planning a journey, Sedat's wife said. No idea what you're talking about. - Don't lie! It's your fault they're flying to Karachi! Calm down, please. Tell him to come back. Why me? - Because you sent him there! Why would I do that? Here, call him. You know where he is. Am I the consulate? I'm giving you three days! Three! Then I'll go to the police and tell them you brainwashed him, turned his head and sent him over there. - Come on! Sister... Let's go to the police. Why? Murat hasn't done anything. Not yet. Don't make something happen! I'm just saying! He's not a Taliban. But he looks like one. - And what do you look like? Like a German hairdresser. Very funny. Is that a new perfume? I love it. DAY S Yes, that's him. That's Murat. On the right? - Yes. - The other one's his friend Sedat. Where are they going? We've no more footage unfortunately. What can you do? Could you go and get him, please? He's been gone five days, hasn't called once. Just a sec. The federal police say two Turkish citizens were heading for Karachi. Your son is Turkish? I told him a hundred times: "Home is where your belly's full, get a German passport." And him: "Sure, next week." It says here one's been arrested and is in custody in Hanover. Alhamdulillah, let's go get him. Arrested? Because of some outstanding debts, a certain Sedat Bilmen. It seems your son flew to Karachi. How am I going to get him back? Allah! He's all alone there. Do you have relatives there? - Us? Of course not, we're Turkish! So what's he doing there now? He wanted to study the Quran. His wife is coming from Turkey in January. He wanted to consoli... consolidate his belief beforehand. So he takes religion seriously? He's gone crazy for Islam recently. We're not like that, but he's always at the mosque, and he's grown a huge beard. A full beard? - Yes. Which mosque? Abu Bakr? Yes. The preacher's a real hothead. - Abdul Farag? So you know him? Rabiye, shut up. - He's trying to help us. No, he isn't! Do you know what else it says here? Our officers at the airport wanted to help the two of them and called Sedat's sister to ask if she would pay his debts. Do you know what she said? - No. "I won't pay for him. He just wants to go to Afghanistan and fight the Americans." What? I'm going to kick Murat's ass today! That's what he thinks! Sassy runt! He's really fresh, huh, Cem? But you, too. OK, time for bed now. Time for bed. Got any photos of yourselves? What for? So I've always got you with me. Why didn't you say anything? How was 1 supposed to know he'd leave the next day? Allah! If only you'd said something. DAY 92 January 2002 Rabiye? Yes? - If you stay at basic speed, you won't see any effect. It's not fast enough? - No, Rabiye. - OK. How are you doing? Very good. You're good. What's your speed? Six? - Yes. Then I'll do seven! Is there open house here? They say a Taliban lives here. What? I'd know about that. Are you his mother? Do you know your son's in Kandahar? Murat? Kanda-what? Kandahar, Afghanistan. What do you say about that? Mrs. Kurnaz, your son is in jail. - What? Why? What can you tell us... - Enough! I don't know anything! I'm Rabiye, Murat's mom. I'll answer your questions. But one at a time. And get off my snowdrops! Sorry. - Honestly! Look, Mom's in the paper! "THE TALIBAN FROM BREMEN"? "Her eyes are red from crying and her hands are trembling. Rabiye K., 44, still can't comprehend what her son is supposed to have done." Mom? - What? I never said any of this! The lady journalist was so nice, said she had a son Cem's age. Never again, you hear? Never again! Plus, I'm only 43! Don't speak to anyone else! Not with the press, not with the cops! What'll happen to Murat, Dad? If he's not done anything bad, nothing. - OK. DAY 120 February 2002 Have a nice day. - Thanks. Sedat? Idiot! It's your fault. You talked him into it. Now you're here and he...? What are you talking about? - Do you know where Murat is? I curse you! At least say you're sorry! Mrs. Kurnaz! - It's your fault! What? - You're so clingy. - How dare you! - He had to go. Murat's been in jail for a month because of you! Calm down! Hey! - Calm down? How? What's going on? Mrs. Kurnaz? Marc Stocker, I'm the district attorney in your son's case. District attorney, good. You can get my Murat back? - Come with me. You're big people, right? If you tell them... It's not as simple as that. Sit down, please. Why not? Murat didn't do anything. He's a good boy... - First of all, Mrs. Kurnaz, we don't know what he did or didn't do. Secondly, we have to inform you that your son was taken to Guantanamo on January 30. What's that? It's a U.S. Army prison camp. On Cuba. In the Caribbean. On the other side of the world? What for? Why in jail? He wanted to join the Taliban. - We suspect. - No. He wanted to study the Quran. - In Pakistan? Aren't the Arab Quran schools much better? - Allah is great. And the combat boots he bought? And didn't he have propaganda videos? Combat? Hiking boots. And the night-sight? That's suspicious. Why? Binoculars. What did he want them for? To look for Allah in Pakistan? The problem is, Murat matches our profile 100%: male, Muslim, likes to travel, single. But he's married. His wife's in Turkey. She calls every day and cries. Mohammed Atta was also married. His wife's still waiting for him. Who's Mohammed Atta? How do I get to... camp... Cuba... thingy? That's Guantanamo? Yes. There are no more photos of it. Mom, does Murat have to kneel down like that, too? Won't they ever let him out? The rice! The rice is burning! Don't cry! Don't cry! Pull yourself together... DAY 234 May 2002 Your flight must've been exhausting. Let's see what the jury decides after the enormous manipulation by the media. Apart from that, was it tiring? Eight hours of cross-examination, in English. Well, if the death penalty's on the table... Nobody needs that. Huh? A visitor? She says you know her. - Ms. Koslowa! You have sons, how lovely! - Yes, most of the time it is. And we know each other? Interesting. Where from? From the telephone. - We spoke on the phone? Almost... From the phone book, IL... You found me in the phone book under "A" for "attorney." No, under "L" for "lawyer." - Even better. Make an appointment... Please help me, my son is in jail far away. But he didn't do anything, it was Sedat. Yes, if you make an appointment... - 1 got a letter from him today. From the Red Cross. Finally. He writes so lovely, but sad. Please make an appointment. Why not now, right away? - No, I have to work now. - Please. You have to help me. I've tried everywhere, the Red Cross, Amnesty, the Christian church. I've even written to the minister. Please. Ms. Koslowa, one minute, please. OK, make it quick. Where's he being held? What's his name? Murat, he's just a lamb... Where? The address? Something with "U." - Fuhlsbdttel Prison? No, on that island. - Island? I have a letter, here's the address. "Camp X-Ray." Ms. Koslowa, postpone my phone call, please. Hey! This is a one-way street! - Hi there! Nuriye! A letter from Murat! For real? - Yes, look! Look! It's his handwriting. "Peace and blessings to you, my dear mother, my dear father, my dear brothers and all who are dear to me. Please don't worry about me, I'm fine, It's just a simple investigation. T'was in Pakistan the whole time and didn't do anything wrong. I hope they'll release me from custody soon. Then I'll be able to come home. Maybe I've caused you a lot of worry. But God will forgive me. Inshallah!" Inshallah. "Pay no attention to what some people are saying. It will only cause you unnecessary worry. Just pray for me as often as you can. If Almighty Ged is willing, everything will soon take a turn for the good and we'll be reunited again. Murat." Today is a good day. Why does he write so much about Allah? He always does. Those Taliban want to bomb us back to the Middle Ages. That doesn't bother you? "Those Taliban"? You don't normally repeat what it says in the tabloids. Besides, the boy is practically being tortured, held in a cage with no outside contact. Now that's medieval. It could turn into an endless task. - What's the problem? Worried we won't make rent? - I think we should discuss it. Right, that's what we're doing. But you've already decided. I thought you'd agree with me. This is about the DNA of our constitutional democracy. Nothing more and nothing less. And you want to defend someone who despises exactly that? What's gotten into her? Her nephew was in the World Trade Center. It's time, Mr. Docke. Right. - Bye. Bye. Bye. He became much more religious, went on that trip in secret, quit school, told a fellow-student he sympathized with the Taliban. He bought his tickets with the card of someone who often frequented the al-Quds mosque in Hamburg... Maybe he kept his trip secret because his parents were against it and that's why someone else bought his tickets, someone who just happens to be from Hamburg. And maybe the other students are badmouthing him because they don't like him. Prove the opposite. You can't, you can't. Neither can the phone calls you've recorded. But we do have reasonable suspicion. I think you're suspicious because you're biased. - For real? Morning. Morning, gentlemen. May we proceed? - By all means. Mr. Klein is here with his defense council, Mr. Docke. For the DA's office, Mr. Stocker? - As usual, The defendant's details: Mr. Carsten Klein, resident in Bremen, born September 1, 1968. DAY 248 June 2002 What hand cream do you use? It's so soft. - It's nothing special. From the drugstore. - Smells good, I love it! And it's not too greasy either. - No, no, not at all. Morning. Good morning, Mr. Docke. Mrs. Kurnaz. What brings you here? - I just wanted to... Any news about Murat? - No, I would've gotten in touch otherwise. My neighbor's lawyer just went and got her Mehmet out of jail. Yes, but your son isn't being held in Fuhlsbttel Prison, T know. T'll pay for your plane ticket. Please try to understand. Guantanamo is on Cuba, but it's an American military base. So the Americans say the prisoners are in another country, outside the jurisdiction of their courts and of the Cuban courts... - Yes, I know. Your son is in a judicial no-man's land at the moment. We're stuck. - But a letter from a man like you... I've written to the German Foreign Office, the Red Cross, the German secret service, the Pentagon and Joschka Fischer. Did I miss anyone, Ms. Koslowa? - No. Fischer? - Our foreign minister. He'd like to help but can't because your son is a Turkish citizen. "You don't get a sweet mouth if you say 'honey." I can't invoke habeas corpus because there's no warrant for his arrest. I can't see the case files because there are no charges. Mr. Bush is denying your son all the rights that a prisoner is normally entitled to. A glass of water, Mrs. Kurnaz? - No, but a Coke would be nice. I'm afraid we don't have any. It doesn't matter... - Tea for you? A double schnapps. Can Mr. Bush keep my Murat locked up for as long as he wants? Theoretically... at this moment... yes. CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN DOUBT APPEAL FOR HELP FROM BREMEN TALIBAN We'll change our strategy. If all legal paths are blocked, we'll have to mobilize the public. This is a list of journalists we'll regularly keep informed from now on. Shall we? The computer is off already. - Well, then turn it back on. DAY 572 April 2003 My God, what's all this? I've made sarma. - With meat? We haven't had it for ages. I've made kofta as well. Wow! Mehmet, dear, I want to go to Turkey. I want to visit my sister, she's asked when I'm coming. And Fadime isn't too well. Whatever you want... When do you have to be there? - Ten minutes ago. And I've got all the tickets. If you could be a little more punctual. And what do you think of my idea? - What idea? That we go to the Turkish authorities. - Already done. Really? What do they say? - Nothing. But some Turkish government officials have visited Murat in Guantanamo. And you're only telling me now! - Look out! Is he well? Is he eating properly? I don't know. The Turkish consulate hasn't replied to my letters... Forget the consulate, try the minister. We say: "You have to have an uncle in Ankara." Isee. Well? Do you have one? I'll figure it out. Do you think Murat is guilty? That doesn't matter to me. Our legal system is also there for those who've committed crimes. He hasn't though, I'm totally certain. I'm not sure if mothers are always the best judges. Well, who else? Honestly! You have a lovely family! - How do you know? From the photo on your desk. Hurry up! - We've got the best seats! Mr. Docke! Which minister should I go to? Ask your "uncle"! DAY 610 June 2003, Ankara, Turkey Now we're at Fadime's! Film me, too! Come on! Unfortunately, the door's locked... Get on with it! Look at that cheeky monkey Attila. What a lovely bride you were. How lovely my dress was. - Yes, it really suits you. Your mother looks really happy, too. She cried buckets. Mothers cry, it's normal. Will T ever see Murat again? Of course, my little dove. We just have to be patient. I know it's really hard for you. But look at me, I'm coping. - We've been married two years. We have the best lawyer in Germany now, really smart. He's speaking to the government. But why is he still in prison? The Germans are smart but slow. You know the saying: "Start it like a Turk, but finish it like a German." I'm seeing the minister of justice tomorrow. Honestly! What has your Murat done for his country? Did he do military service here? No. Why should we help him? The Germans say it's the Turks' jurisdiction. - He grew up there, he's their responsibility. They just don't want to get their hands dirty. - Nonsense! The Germans are scared of the Americans. That's why they want the Turks to take charge. There's an appointment free with the secretary of state in November. November? - The 14th, at 10:30 a.m. Is that him? Mr. Minister, sir! - No, wait! Stop, wait! - Mr. Minister! Here's a letter from the German foreign minister. Yogurt or tomato sauce? That's enough, thanks. I made it all myself. - That's enough, thanks. A mocha? Sugar? Sorry... - Come in and sit down. Mr. Docke eats like a bird: "For each grain of rice you leave, you'll have a child!" No, I'm eating, I'm eating. Here, I always make this on special occasions. OK, and what are we celebrating? Mrs. Kurnaz spoke to the Turkish minister of justice. He's going to look into Murat's case. - Personally. He even had tea with me. What a man! A mocha, too? - No... Er, thanks. Everything's going to be alright. - Of course, Never thought I'd meet the minister, did you? Honestly! - Sure I did. In the meantime, I've spoken to the lawyers of other prisoners in Guantanamo, and with a human rights organization... - Here you go, against the evil eye. DAY 782 November 2003 Hi, Marc. - Hello, Mr. Docke. Mr. Docke, lawyer. Lieutenant Schartig. Hi. - Also investigating the Kurnaz case. None of us are having any luck with Kurnaz. - Depends what you call luck. Can we talk? - I have to go to the press conference about the Islamist. Who hijacked the bus. Or if you're defending him as well, hop in. Call my office for an appointment. See you, - Have a nice day. Hi. Quick, Schartig's waiting in the car. Seen this? - No, what does it say? Three German secret agents questioned Kurnaz in Guantanamo. Know anything about it? How did they find out? That's irrelevant. What's going on there? OK. Yes, I heard about it. Schartig had to prepare a list of questions for the secret service to ask Kurnaz, I really have to go. - They say they can't help him because he's Turkish but send three agents to question him? Apparently, they found him harmless. Harmless? - Naive, immature. Wrong place, wrong time. No contacts to al-Qaida or the Taliban anywhere. Leaving aside any doubts about why he went to Pakistan, they say he only traveled from mosque to mosque. Complaint about the search warrant? - Almost finished. We urgently need our reasons for appealing in the Klein case. It's Bernhard's case. Bernhard? The Klein appeal? - Yes. Sorry. - You've got to be kidding! The deadline's tomorrow. Sorry, I was dealing with the press release. This Kurnaz case is eating you up. - The boy is innocent. The secret service questioned him in Guantanamo and found him harmless. The secret service. - And we suddenly trust them? I contacted them immediately. They understand Murat's family's "concern." But they're sworn to secrecy. It's like a black hole! And you want to put that in the press release? No. The Supreme Court. We'll join a class action lawsuit against the American government. The Supreme Court, seriously? - Yes. We have to get the American judiciary to accept responsibility for the prisoners in Guantanamo. When will they make their decision? Soon. I hope. Give me your appeal, I'll do it. - Thanks, Wolfgang. No, not him, I want to speak to the minister. He promised me! Even the deaf sultan in Egypt heard it! I'm going crazy! Why won't anyone help me? Why do I keep getting passed around like a parcel? OK, I'll wait. DAY 866 February 2004 Morning. Why aren't you answering the phone? Ms. Koslowa has been calling you. - My husband's asleep. Night shift. I'm sorry. It's about Washington. Phew, it's not burned. The Supreme Court has decided to make a statement about Guantanamo. That's a positive signal, do you see? It's about getting public opinion on our side. Don't worry, the human rights organization will pay the travel costs. But what would I do there? We're going to hand in a petition at the White House. A petition? A kind of letter, a demand... Can't you send it in the mail? - No... Handing in a petition will attract lots of media attention. Do this petition without me, OK? But the media are more interested in family members. Not in lawyers. If you came, it would be more interesting for the press. You always talk so sweet and then... The minister didn't call either. That smells really delicious. Is it an apple cake? Murat's favorite cake. He's got good taste. - Yes. Your Murat. You see, that's partly the problem. I don't know him at all. This is the first time I've defended someone I've never met, Would you like to see him? I'stand in front of the TV. I'm hiding the screen. Cem films everything. We always do karaoke on birthdays. You know it? Sure, "The Great Battle"! To see who sings best. And who won? Me, I always do! Mr. Kurnaz! I'm sorry if we woke you. I'm Bernhard Docke, your lawyer. Lawyer? Mehmet, darling... I've... He's... Ah, the damaged fender? Is it about the insurance? He's Murat's lawyer. We're going to Washington to hand in... A petition. At the White House. Washington? I'm sorry, you'll have to take off your shoes. But there's only a bit of metal, see? Isee, but you have to take your shoes off. Thank you. But the floor's really cold. That's your hair clip. I can't take it off, it'll ruin my hairdo. Come with me, please. - Honestly! Bernhard, honestly! We're almost done, thank you for your cooperation. Tlove it! From now on, I'll always fly business class. Yes, a Hollywood star is the co-founder of the "Guantanamo Human Rights Commission." He arranged the upgrade for us. Hollywood? We'll have to dress up, won't we? Would you like some champagne? - Is it free? Thanks. Here, Bernhard. No, I have to work. - So what? I never drink alcohol. DAY 887 March 2004, Washington, DC Welcome to Washington. Thank you Nice! Wow, a V12! Fantastic car! My husband works at Mercedes. Mercedes, yeah? We get a new car every year at a discount. 1 love the Roadster SLC. White, of course! roadster? White? Of course .. Of course Lovely! Terrific! No city tour please. Take New York Avenue. But keep going fast! Thank you! What a driver! You drove so quickly! I love it! Mrs. Kurnaz, we really have to go. Are all these people lawyers? They're people like you, parents... Bernard Docke? Nice to see you. Michael? All mine. sorry for the delay And that must be Mrs. Docke. no No! This is Rabiye Kurnaz, Murat's mother. The mother! I was expecting a man. Most of them are fathers. Those Turkish names... I don't speak Turkish. Who is he? - Michael Ratner, head of the CCR. He mistook you for a man because they're mostly fathers here. I see, I'm sorry. Tell him Mehmet wanted to come but he has to work. - Yes... - I'm sorry... No, that's great! You are Murat's mother. Wonderful! Come on, we have a lot to talk about. I said hot. It's hot in here. I don't speak English. No English. Turkish? You speak Turkish? You're a Turk? Pardon? I do not understand the arabic language. I don't speak Arabic. 1 speak German and Turkish, OK? Turkish? That's even worse. Here. Thanks. Many Thanks. Here, this is Murat. My son. He's in Guantanamo. That's why I'm here. Her son? My son, yes. Wait. My son. Your son. Mohammed Khan. Also in Guantánamo. You see, you and me, we have to fight to get our boys out of Guantanamo. OK? Good night. - Good night, Bernhard. Thanks. You welcome i want my son back If he has done something wrong, they can put him on trial. He is not a threat to the security of the American. My message to George W. Bush and his administration is that they are wrong. My son... How long's he going to babble on for? - He's a banker. My son... is not a terrorist. Excuse me, please, sir. Is there any sugar? Pardon? - She would like some sugar. Sugar. Of course, I'm sorry. Nice man. Looks good for his age. Do you know who that is? He invited us here. - Yes, but he's also one of... Please. Sugar. Thank you. More. More. They like it sweet, I understand. That's good. For him, too! No thank you. Thank you very much. And how do you like Washington? How do I like Washington? Good, but what are all these blacks doing here? She likes it very much. Especially the ethnic diversity. Yes, it's very colorful here. Why is he helping us? - Why...? She wants to know why you are helping us. This is a very good question. Long story short, because I like America. I like his civilizational achievements... Because its democratic achievements are close to his heart. Of course, the good man loves his country. But he should feed his ficus plant. Otherwise it'll die. Honestly! Ficus plant? Fertilizer? Water? Water? What is the Supreme Court? The highest court of the USA. Why court? Murat hasn't done anything. That's what a court is supposed to clarify. Why are you whispering? - Because this is a silent march. Nobody disputes the mistakes of American politics. But for many people , the prisoners of Guantanamo are Criminals willing to cut our throats. I know what you mean, but you're wrong. To find out if someone has committed an atrocity, must be accused and brought to justice. This is the only way mankind has found. And who showed her this way? America. That's why we're here! With this march they want to demand the release of their children. You said we were going to give the president a letter. Yes, well... We've handed him the petition symbolically. But we didn't even make it to the doorman. - Right here, Martin Luther King gave his famous "I have a dream" speech, in which he demanded equal rights for African-Americans. And now we're going home? That was it? 250,000 people were here, they reached all the way to the back. More than on our march. You could've spoken to the journalists. - And said what? Who you are, why you're here... - I don't know that myself. And that's Abraham Lincoln, one of the most important presidents of the United States... He abolished slavery. I think I've got that jet lag thing. Sorry, we're turning. To the Eastern Market please. This was a good idea of yours! But we don't have much time... - Watch out! Dog shit! Thanks. You're always looking inward. Honestly! Look, how lovely! We can buy something for our boys. It's nice, do you think it would suit Cem? - No. I warned him not to go to Afghanistan or Pakistan. Because they lock him up. And me right away. People in a hurry die sooner. Why did you have to haggle, the price was fair? You should say no seven times before saying yes. And you gave the taxi driver the wrong address. - I'm a lawyer, not a guide. Sorry... - No problem, but you two are close. Right now? - Above all, Rabiye should speak. What does he want? She is the only mother with us. The families of the victims of 9/11 are mostly mothers. It is best to speak to them from the heart. I don't think she will talk. - Why? She is a brave woman. He wants us to give a speech. - Sure, go ahead. You, too. - What, me? No. That's what I told him. - What? That I wouldn't speak? You could've asked me first. Honestly! Would you do it? To be here tonight with the families of the victims of 9/11 and the families of the Guantanamo prisoners, is a high point for me here in Washington. Finally , Rabiye Kurnaz from Germany and Bernhard Docke, her lawyer, speak to you. Should I start? How's my hairdo? Fine. Hello, I'm Murat Kurnaz's mother. I hope everything will turn out alright soon. And that the innocent will soon be released. That's why I'm here, and... Because Mr. Docke here, who's my lawyer, told me that here in Washington a court is investigating their case. And... Rabiye is the mother of Murat Kurnaz. She comes from Germany. I'm your attorney Her son has been imprisoned in Guantanamo since January 2002. And we are here to fight for his right to fair treatment whatever he is supposed to have done we hope that the Supreme Court will rule accordingly. Sometimes... quite frequently... in my dreams... I'see Murat. Sitting there in that cage. Waiting. And waiting. All alone. And every day he thinks... I'm coming to get him. But nothing happens. And it's making me ill. I'm his mom. I cook the meals, I do the shopping, I wash the clothes, and I think about him all the time. I don't know how he is. Do they feed him, give him a bed to sleep on? Is he even alive? The last card from him came two years ago. Two years, can you imagine? A day has 24 hours. We've written many, many letters. I spoke to the minister, but nobody helped me. We're just supposed to wait. Wait and wait. But I can't do it anymore. We say: "Waiting is the death of hope." And that's why I'm here. Although I... Although I'm just his mom. Isn't that...? the nice man? - Yes, it's Tim Williams! Like I said, a Hollywood star. - You never said, you rascal! I did. - By Allah, what must he think of me? Honestly! Looks like you're just back from your honeymoon. - No! He brought you the sugar! It's going to look really cool. I'm back, my sweethearts! I missed you so much, my little boys! How are you? Did you have enough to eat? Yes, Cem did the cooking. - What? Spaghetti every day. - But it was good! Then we did a silent march. Then we marched to the White House and gave the president a letter. What? The president? Honestly? - Yes! What did he say? - It was symbolic. We went to see a Hollywood star. He was so nice. Really famous, but not arrogant. Do I know him? - Tim William, Tim Williams! Really? He's so hot! Only the best for you. - Thank you, sister. I always thought the Americans were really cold, but everyone kept hugging me. Honestly! And Murat? Will they be releasing him soon? That's great. You'll have more time for your family again. You can't leave everything to Cem. Sister, have you put on weight? Me? Where? Behind my ear? Just look at these bingo wings! Get outta here! -I can see it. I didn't understand a thing! Cem! Come on, get in! I have to go. Sorry. Mom, you don't have to pick me up. I'm not a little kid anymore. I just wanted to get my kiss. Come on! Come on! I saw your teacher. What? You didn't talk about Murat? - No, about you. She's worried about you. You fell asleep in class and your grades have gotten worse. What's up? What's the matter? Was that too much housework while I was away? T have to do this for Murat now. Do you understand? But I can't if you don't help me. What doesn't kill us makes us harder. Stop it! Mehmet, a new car? You must be doing well! You've always wanted one. For real? DAY 933 April 2004 Morning, Mrs. Kurnaz! What's wrong, are you stuck in traffic? I thought we'd have a glass of champagne before taking off. For free, of course. Yes, Washington. The Supreme Court tries the case tomorrow. We talked about it last week. Washington? Why Washington? We were only just there. Me? Why me? But... Yes, OK... Yes. What is it? I have to go to Washington. When? Now? Dad, she's doing it for Murat. And what for? Why are you always running after him? Do you know he's innocent? He's done three years in jail for nothing? Because you do nothing doesn't make him a criminal. Right, I do nothing! Alright, alright, shit! Sister! Murat does what he wants and you're all suffering. He's my son. - But Cem and Attila need you, tco. What would you do in my position? Tell me! The taxi's here. Where are the keys? Gone. - What? He used to do this before I set off for work. But I'll show him. Come on, give me a hand. Be careful. - Give me my suitcase. You've always been crazy. To the airport! Take care! - You too! How long are you going to bulk for? "Sulk." It's called "sulking." I said "bulk" on purpose. Today I'll have a drink with you, Allah isn't looking. God makes life easy for us. Whenever I can't fast during Ramadan, 1 just give 300 euros to the poor. What's that? What's the matter with him? Would you like some peanuts? Would you please switch? - Another whiskey, sir? Why's he on that box? No thank you. That's a prison in Iraq where the Americans have been tort... have been mistreating prisoners. What's he saying? He said only a small number of soldiers did it. Black sheep. Do they also do that in Guantanamo? Surely not. The war in Iraq is terrible. That's true. I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Good night. Rabiye, wait. I've been wanting to... With what's up ahead, maybe it would be helpful if... I'm Bernhard. Yes, I know. I mean we should be on first-name terms. I see, I'm Rabiye. Where are you all, my sweethearts? I'm in the hotel in Washington now. It's very nice here, I'm fine. I love you all. See you soon. Thanks, Bernhard. Fastest route to the Supreme Court. Via Independence Avenue, please. WBC news from Washington. Good morning New investigation into the abuse Iraqi prisoner by US soldiers were initiated... Hey, weren't you guys on TV? Because of Guantanamo? Yes, we were on TV. Understand. The ride today is free. I want you to win the case. I'm tired of being ashamed of my country. Thanks. Nothing to thank for. There she is! - Ms. Kurnaz, do you have a moment? Don't say Murat is innocent, that will be decided at trial. Have you no understanding for the Americans' hard course after the crimes committed on 9/11? I just want my son to get what that American got. What was his name again? - John Walker. Exactly. They arrested him in Afghanistan and put him on trial here. But my Murat: straight to jail. I don't see any human rights here. Do you? Here, on the Supreme Court portico, it says: "Equal justice under law." That's what we're demanding, nothing more. I hope the judges decide in our favor. For me, for my son. And for the taxi driver from before, so he can be proud of his country again. How do you know about John Walker? Surprised, huh? I've been doing some research. Aren't you going to praise me? Honestly! This building dates back to 1935. They wanted to erect a temple of justice and used only the best materials, of course... Shit! - Mind your language. My briefcase! I left it in the taxi with all my documents. Bernhard, do you mean this? You've got it! Rabiye, you're like a mother! It's OK if you give me a hug. Bernhard, Rabiye, nice to see you again! John Gibbons, retired judge. He's representing us at the hearing. Bernhard Docke, a brilliant human rights lawyer, and Rabiye, Murat's mother. My pleasure. - Hi. Should we? - After you. The Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court! Hear! Hear! Hear! All persons involved are asked to to give the court their full attention. The court is now in session. God save the United States and this honorable court. We now hear the plea in Case 03-334: Shafiq Rasul versus George W. Bush and a companion case. Herr Gibbons. Mr. President, High Court: In this case, the federal courts have jurisdiction for the enforcement of the rule of law at stake. Respondents claim they can without judicial review holding foreign nationals captive outside our state borders... DAY 998 June 2004 Bernhard, you gave me a heart attack! I'm not used to this! Honestly! Today, the American president was outvoted six votes to three by the greatest court in the USA! To the Supreme Court's decision! Cheers, - Cheers. - Cheers. This is a "habeas corpus,” with a demand to see the case files, access to the client and a judicial review of his arrest. What does this mean: "Rabiye Kurnaz versus George W. Bush"? That you're filing a suit against the American president. Who, me? Yes, you! Nuriye always says: "If a camel goes to Mecca 40 times, that doesn't make it a pilgrim." "Cobbler, stick to your trade." "Cobbler"? - That's the German saying. - Shoes, huh? Also good. I don't think much of it. - Me neither, Bernhard. I'll bet some camels make better pilgrims. Or presidents. DAY 1037 August 2004 Get a move on or you'll be late again! Here, take this. I don't understand. Why do you need a second lawyer? You don't understand? A German can't practice law in the USA. Look, I like this one. It makes you look really pale. Try this one. I thought Murat would be released, now that you've won. But not right away. But now he can appeal against his detention. It's all so complicated. You totally look like a waitress! - Honestly? Our new lawyer is a professor. Then you'll need a fancy necklace... Yes, this is nice. Let's go. Rabiye. Nice to see you. Bernhard told me a lot about you. Baher has finally seen the files and now he can tell us what they're accusing Murat of. Did he really do something? no He is said to have had contacts with people who had contacts with al-Qaeda. But the only evidence of this is a reference to the German investigation file. They ought to release him. - What? - They've no evidence, just rumors. Did you talk to Rabiye about the tribunal? No, not yet. What did he say? That Murat was put before a military tribunal in Guantanamo. And they, of course, concluded that his detention there is justified. That's normal. - What is it, a court? According to Mr. Bush it is, in reality it's a farce. The prisoners have no lawyers, can't see any evidence, and anything can be used against them. But why are they allowed to do that? - Because the Supreme Court didn't stipulate what kind of court the prisoners should go before. And Bush says a tribunal is also a court. I'm sorry, Baher, I just explained it to her. No problem. But we won't let him get away with it. And then Bush will think of another way to keep Murat locked up! It was clear that they would boycott the Supreme Court's judgment. "With this letter, I wish to ask all those responsible to release my brother. Because I really miss him and the time I spend with him. Since I was born, he's always been there for me. And we used to do a lot together." Mom... - Carry on, it's lovely. What's the point of it? - It's for the court, So they can get to know Murat better. Carry on reading, honey. "So, I'm pretty confident when I say that he would never plan an act of terror. I never even..." Carry on, Cem. Carry on. "I never even saw him hurt an ant. And my little brother Attila, who's in third grade, also really misses him. When we were..." It's only Nuriye. What's up, Nuriye? We're busy. What? Hold on. Rabiye, turn the TV on loud! Something about Murat. - What? Murat? The residence permit expires when the foreign citizen doesn't return to Germany within six months or a longer period approved by the immigration authorities. What does this mean in the case of Murat Kurnaz? We assume that he left Germany in October 2001, and didn't return in the following six months. This means his previous open residence permit has expired. What? And that's that? They won't let Murat back into Germany. He hasn't reapplied for his residence permit or given any indication that... What's going on? Why are they doing this? Because we're Turks. Because we don't belong, Mom. ...therefore he has no right to enter Germany. I've been working my ass off here for years and now you guys are putting a spoke in my wheel. "You guys"? You know this isn't on me. The boy could've gone to a phone booth. In Guantanamo. To extend his residence permit. Be honest, is this just bureaucratic stupidity or what's behind it? It's possible that someone's scared of the press furor if he comes home: "Germany lets Taliban back in," that kind of thing. Which "someone"? Who? In any event, someone who's worried about how it would look. You mean my own red-green government, which I voted for, is trying to prevent him from ever coming back? Deliberately? Shit. Shit! Something else, Bernhard. There's a note from the Americans to our government in which they offer to release Kurnaz. - What? From the CIA. - When? Autumn 2002. Autumn 2002? You can't be serious. The boy's been locked in a cage for three years for nothing? What do I know? But officially I don't know anything anyway. "Dear Interior Minister, I was very surprised by your statement. Murat Kurnaz is a Bremen boy, 19 years old... 19 years... old... He was 19 years old when he left Germany. This means that he was legally a minor and should be treated as such..." Sorry. Would you like a glass? Yes, why not? This is the first time in a long while that the stress has made you cough. It's from the soccer game. Oh well, it'll do, I suppose. And what if it's all in vain? If no one helps us? Hi, Bernhard! - You're early! I wanted to be on time today. You wanted to meet me at 10 a.m. Back pain? You poor thing, I'll take you to a doctor! No. - You need a shot for the pain. Come on now. I can't straighten my back. - What did you do? Careful now. Maybe you need a break, Bernhard. I appreciate what you're doing for me. You've never asked to be paid for it. If you said you couldn't carry on anymore, I don't know what I would do. But I wouldn't be angry with you. It's just... It's just lower back pain, Rabiye. I'll be fine once I've had my shot. OK. DAY 1252 March 2005 Sorry... - Not now, Ms. Koslowa. Baher is just talking about Murat. - About tomorrow's press conference. - Yes? We'll have to find another room. Why? They asked me why I'm defending someone who rejects our constitutional democracy. But don't worry, I'll find something else. - Thank you. You give my message to Murat ? - Yes I did. But he didn't believe me. He thought it was a trap. He thought it was a trap. But then he wanted a cup of coffee. I got them for him from McDonald's the next day, with lots of sugar. Right, lots of sugar! He hasn't lost his sense of humor. He invited me into the interrogation room as if we were at his house. I had also brought him an apple turnover. He was happy then. He said it reminded him of your cake. He said he brought him an apple turnover and it reminded him of your cake. He's very proud of you. "My mother was in America for me?" he kept asking. He could not believe it. He couldn't believe you went to America for him. I'd go to the end of the earth. Thank you, Baher. Excuse me, but I have to lie down. Jet lag. Yes, take a rest. I'm going, too, Bernhard. Stay for a second, OK? Thank you Baher, see you tomorrow. What is it? Your English is really improving. - It'll soon be as good as yours. Would you like a packet of coffee? Uta got it from work, a premium blend. What do you want to say to me, dear? There's something... We'll discuss it at the press conference, but you should know about it now. Murat has been tortured. I was half-expecting it, Bernhard. In the American detention camp in Kandahar, Murat Kurnaz was repeatedly beaten. During the interrogation, his head was held under water in order to simulate drowning, and he was given electric shocks via his feet. One time, a soldier held a gun to his head and shouted: "I'm going to kill you!" Kurnaz was put in chains and hung by his hands for long periods. In Guantanamo he was tortured systematically by means of sleep deprivation, constant loud music and constant interrogations. Yes? I understand that what's been done to your client, Mr. Kurnaz, is truly terrible. But leaving aside individual cases, what human rights can we still afford in the face of Islamist terror? The question is irrelevant to me. If we give up our democratic principles, the terrorists will have achieved their aim. But do the old norms still apply? How do you threaten a suicide bomber, for example? With the death penalty? I'd like to return to Murat Kurnaz. An American judge in Washington recently stated in her judgment that Murat's case was one of the most flagrant examples of military abuse in Guantanamo, because he was being detained solely on the basis of speculation while evidence of his innocence was being ignored. At the same time, it's been more or less proven that at the time of his arrest he was sold to the Americans by the Pakistanis for a bounty of 3,000 dollars. So why is he still being held if he's virtually been acquitted? Because the negotiation was about the question whether the military tribunal in Guantanamo had jurisdiction. And the answer to that was no. The tribunals at Guantanamo are unjust and unconstitutional. How do you plan to proceed now? We have to fight for our constitutional democracy centimeter by centimeter. And this is why we're urgently appealing to you as representatives of the press: help us, appeal to our government to give us its support. You see... This lady is a mother. She hasn't seen her son for three and a half years now. She knows her son has done nothing wrong. And she now knows how he's being treated there. But what she doesn't know is when and if she will ever see her son again. I don't know if you have children, if you can imagine what she's going through. Are you sick? Do you need a doctor? No, I'm fine. This happens a lot. I suspected it all along. But... The truth is sometimes more bitter than poison. What are you doing, my angel? We're out of bread. Are you all alone? - Dad's at work and Cem's at a party. He'll be back soen though. Cem showed me how to make this if I'm hungry. Want some? It's the best meal in the world. That's right. The best in the world. The release of my son Mohammad from Guantanamo, this is the happiest day of my life. My father showed me the way to dignity Hope, Courage, resilience, patience and faith. Hello? He fought for me in the darkest of times... Yes, I'm watching it as well. I think it's a step in the right direction. Murat's coming home! He's coming home! - Says who? Someone from Turkey. Who is this, please? When? How? She's talking to a policeman. - What? - When? Murat's coming home! Of course, Oh my God! Thank you! What's going on? - That was the Turkish police. Murat's coming home at last! When? At Incirlik tomorrow, honey! Really? - Yes. Tickets, we need tickets! We have to get to the airport! DAY 1255 March 2005, Incirlik, Turkey It is a mystery to me. Why are they suddenly releasing him? Because of the press conference? The role of the Turks was probably decisive. Do you think? I've been working for him for so long, but today is my first time seeing him. Don't be shocked though, he has such a beard! Oh my God, like a caveman! We'll cut it off when we get home! Look, Baher. Do you think this will still fit Murat? No way! It was his favorite T-shirt. - There he is! No... Fadime! Wait! Rabiye! That isn't Murat. - What? Murat has red hair. - Right. We'll clear this up, you'll soon be together again. Our lawyers will take care of everything. Bernhard! I'll call the embassy. You promised he would come back and that we'd live in Germany. Why did he have to go there? - He did it for you! Only for you! So he would be a good Muslim husband. I loved him just as he was. She asks how that could have happened. Obviously a mix up. The man they released is also called Murat Bernhard, my dear. Why won't they free Murat? Is it because he's Turkish? She really loves him, doesn't she? Fadime. She's a woman: she wants children, a family. You Germans and your "love." Someone proposed to me recently. He said he'd seen me on TV and fallen in love, He wanted me and the kids to move in with him, What a retard. Would you have done it if...? If you'd fallen in love with him? - Get outta here. I've never been in love. It was only ever about the children for me. Never? Who knows? If I'm reincarnated, maybe I'll take you. Or this Tim William. Oh my God! Cem, honey! Why didn't you say something? I don't even have a present. It's OK, I didn't want a party. What's going on? - It's Cem's birthday. He's 16, he's allowed to buy beer now. I've forgotten your birthday. I'm a terrible mom! You're a wonderful mother. It's OK. - Oh my child! My child, everything is going to be alright. My dear. DAY 1509 November 2005, Bremen Rabiye! Long time no see. It's about time. I've been traveling a lot. - IT know, I saw you on TV. What's happening with your son, is he coming back? Sorry. - Everything's going to be alright. Let's start with something easy, OK? It'll do you good to run a little. OK? My client has remained outside Germany for longer than six months not because he chose to of his own free will, but because of his forced detention at the American base in Guantanamo. For this reason, his current residence permit cannot have expired. Rabiye! What have you been up to? Been driving too fast again? Oh, Bernhard... Are you hurt? - Not at all. She was lucky, not even a scratch. But she does nothing but complain. I'm so tired. Then get up for a while. Lying around all day won't make it better. I can't, I swear... We... We won at Bremen Court of Claims. They can't deny Murat his right to stay here. Isee. He'll come back, sister. One day, he'll come back. He's a good boy, isn't he? Sweetheart. Talk to her, I'm just the little sister. Did you hear? We have a new government now. Christian democrats. Maybe we should write a letter to them. Oh, Bernhard... My friend. The new secretary of internal affairs has even admitted that Murat was interrogated by the German secret service. The previous government always denied it. Do you still believe we can win? I'm fighting for justice here. Come on, get up. We need you. What for? Who else will keep me going? Who else will turn up uninvited in my office with cake and all the rest? Who'll keep calling me at the wrong moment? Do you know how dull and boring it is without you? You're a good person... Bernhard. Mom? What are you doing? I have to do the ironing. - What? No, go back upstairs! I'll do it. Second item on the agenda: the swearing in of the chancellor. Madam Chancellor, please come forward to be sworn in. I swear to use my power for the good of the German people, to improve their lives and protect them from harm, to respect and defend the constitution and laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, to perform my duties conscientiously and to be fair and just to all. So help me God. Bernhard, my dear, did you write that letter to the chancellor? Not yet, she's only just taken office. Why not now? You said you would. She spoke so nicely about justice. - Yes. They all do at the beginning. I believe her, Bernhard, she's a mother. No, she isn't. - But she's a woman. DAY 1543 December 23, 2005 Do the next one right away! I've won! - No! Yes, I have. Look, mine's perfect. - Doesn't matter, I did mine first! You're just quick and sloppy. - Don't be sassy! Beat him, Mom! Beat him! You ruined my homework! It's your fault, Mom! Bernhard! Perfect timing! Would you like to eat with us? - No, my wife's waiting. Too spontaneous for you, huh? Come in. Who is it? - Bernhard. Hi, guys. - Look, Which is the nicest? You decide. Good evening, Mr. Lawyer. Hello, Mr. Kurnaz. - Hello. Why are you here? Isn't it Christmas for you? - Yes, tomorrow. Christmas is tomorrow, today was my last day at work. And just before 4 p.m., this letter arrived. Where's it from? "The Chance Office"? "The Chancellor's Office." She's replied? After two days? My eyes... Re ad it. Give it here, I'll read it. - Quickly. Read it to us! "Dear Mr. Docke, Federal Chancellor Merkel has asked me to answer your letter of December 19, 2005, concerning the detention of Murat Kurnaz. For humanitarian reasons, the German government has appealed on Mr. Kurnaz's behalf several times to the American government and will continue to do this in future. In the light of our previous experience with the Turkish and American authorities, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will consider your suggestion for a German-Turkish initiative and get in touch with you." Who knows? Maybe we'll be lucky. AFTER 1786 DAYS August 24, 2006, Ramstein, Germany Hi, Mr. Bastian. - Hi. It's along here on the right. Make yourselves at home. - Thank you. We've prepared a small buffet. Thank you for your hospitality, we won't overstay our welcome. Thank you for this, the press would've been all over us otherwise. We're happy to help. I recommend the cream sponge with roasted almonds, it's a favorite here. And good luck. Especially to you, Mrs. Kurnaz. - Thank you. Go get something to eat. Look, Bernhard: is this dog or bear? I'd say it's a bear. Where are Murat's things? - I didn't bring them: bad omen. Man, it's hot today. I don't know, I'm cold. It's because you're nervous. Probably. By the way, you really should try the cake, it's delicious. Thank you. Murat? Cem? - No, I'm Attila. Do you think he'll ever eat normally again? He drank his soup from the bowl. Think what he's been through. He'll be OK. But he walks like one of those Japanese women. - A geisha? - Yes. Because of the shackles. He'll have to learn to walk properly again. Without chains. That's true, you're right. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow, - See you tomorrow. Murat, my love. I have to tell you something. Your wife, Fadime. She divorced you a few months back. She couldn't stand waiting anymore. Can we stop? Do you need to pee? I want to be alone for a moment. I understand, my dear. I'll come with you. You know, Mom... There was neon light on all the time. 24/7. I'd forgotten how lovely the night is. Tell Fadime, when you speak to her... that I wish her a good life. Congratulations, it's more than I expected. But this isn't a happy ending, sorry. Can't you take a compliment? - Sure, but cut out the happy-ending crap. What else do you want? He's back. Yes, but why only now after all this time? - Mr. Docke? Will T get my interview with Mrs. Kurnaz? - Sure, she'll be here soon. Take care, my friend. Rabiye, are you going to be long? Everyone's waiting for you. Baher, the journalists and me, of course. The press conference is about to start. I really don't have time for that. Honestly! Shopping, none of Murat's clothes fit him. This one, but with a 32 waist. - Of course, Sorry, Bernhard. See you later. But smaller, please, and lighter. Bernhard Docke fought unsuccessfully for years to rehabilitate Murat Kurnaz. Two commissions of inquiry discovered that German government officials had tried to prevent his return for political reasons. He has received no compensation. None of the politicians responsible have ever accepted responsibility for what happened. No one has ever apologized to him or his family. Murat Kurnaz is now a social worker in Bremen. He is married with three daughters. Rabiye became seriously ill after her son's return. She is now recovering. 20 years after 9/11, 39 people are still being held without trial in Guantanamo. RABIYE KURNAZ VERSUS GEORGE W. BUSH
