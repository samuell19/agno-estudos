Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. ENRICO CARUSO LEGEND OF A VOICE Your pleasant image, no one will ever forget it. Of the resplendent blue of the sky, is the peaceful sea. The heart that does not get drunk doesn't enjoy pleasures. Whenever, I think of those moments, return more tenderly joys and memories of my happy days. Yes, my happy days. Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye cherished memories of the time that has passed. Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye, cherished memories of the time that has passed. This film isn't meant to be a biography but the poetic re-enactment of the youth of a man who conquered and made happy millions of men. It wants to be a thanksgiving to a singer who is no more, to the town which gave him birth, to a humble mother who in poverty and sickness, always with great love and immeasurable faith gave the first boost to the brilliant rise of her son. Because of my great grief, I'm praying at your feet. That's him. ...my pains never have any truce. My pain you see from heaven. Please, save, Oh God, my parent. Ave Maria. Hush, boys! Behave! My respects, Father Bronzetti. - My greetings, Doctor. Ma'am. Here is our Caruso. Kiss the lady's hand, Enrico. Mrs Tivaldi is a great voice teacher and maybe she'll give you lessons. The lessons will be free, of course. It's well worth it. The boy's voice is remarkable, don't you think? How old you? - 13. You see, Ma'am, I do what I can with these boys. Only you, Ma'am, can teach Enrico how to truly sing. - I'll see. I'll let you know when I come to see your mama. How is she? Still the same. - Did she get the medicine ordered for her? Well, never mind. I'll bring it myself. Bye. - Go now. He's a nice boy. He lives in poverty, yet sometimes I think he's happy. The good God gave him the gift of song. It's a gift one pays dearly for. Ices! Ices! Refresh your mouths! Do you want an ice cream? - You bet! Ices! - Listen, my good man. Tell me. - I'd like a regular ice cream. Chocolate, strawberry and lemon. - A one soldo ice cream? No, 2 soldi. I'd never want a one soldo ice cream. - Fine. Excuse me, you pay. I don't have any change. Me? I don't have a cent! What about your mechanic's salary? It's Saturday, right? It's been 2 days since they sent me away. - 4 soldi. This ice cream is good. Really good. And you wanted two scoops! You ate it and now you don't pay! Holy crap! I'll show you! I'll show you next time! You must die right away! Roses, May roses, Miss! May roses. Good day! Salute them! Sir, a lovely rose for the lady? I say, pal, this is my world. How swell it is to be a gentleman, eh? Are you going to tell me why they turned you away from the shop? For singing, not working hard and distracting the others. You need a deaf boss! Good day! Here we are, Enrico! Good day, my dear. - Good day. Let's beat it! Good day. Welcome, eh? - Thanks. Thank you. - Bravo, little knight. Take this. No! Take it. Bye. Are you stupid? Damn! He wants to be a gentleman. He gives alms... We don't have any money! I wonder who she was? - You don't know women! She's probably a duchess or... - No, even more! Fine, then a princess. - No, even more! What? A queen? - A singer! You think a singer is more than a duchess or a princess? Yes, the princess and the duchess pay money to hear the singer. Have you ever seen a singer pay money to see them? - No, truly. By the way, how much did that gentleman give to you? I don't know. Maybe it was 1000 lire. Jesus! Mary! We could've got so many ices: strawberry, lemon, pistachio, cinnamon! Sirs, don't disturb the guests. Go away! Sorry but... - You can't do that here. Go away! Go away! Go! But Neapolitan songs are so beautiful! Another day that has gone badly! We don't get to eat today too, eh? We poor men are always cursed! Who's that? - Open yourself, window! Let me look at Maria, Because I'm in the middle of the road yearning to see her. I can't find a moment of peace! The night becomes day, I'm always here waiting, hoping she'd talk to me. Oh, Mari', oh Mari', how much sleep have I lost for you! Let me sleep a bit in your arms. Oh, Mari', oh Mari', how much sleep have I lost for you! Let me sleep, oh, Mari', oh Mari'! Bravo! - A revelation! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! We thank you! According to your goodness, Excellency. We thank you! Thank you so much, Colonel! Make a bow! Make a bow! Give them the money. The song is theirs. - Are you crazy? My boy! Come here! You sound like an angel! You have moved Luigi Gregorio Proboscide! That's me! You know me? Well, you're still too young. My friends, I must speak with you. Come. Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Away! Cavaliere, your bill. - Ah, right. For you! Mark that down. Let's check out the takings. There's even a silver coin! You've touched some girl's heart. You know how many lovelorn young men would like to have a voice but do not? So they come to me: Proboscide! And when they get up serenades, you can sing for them. Am I clear? Excuse me, Mr Proboscis... - Proboscide, young man, Proboscide! Enrico's voice is a boy's. How would girls think that their sweetheart is singing? The question is clever but you must think about certain circumstances. And a voice in the night, what does it matter if it comes from a tenor or a boy? It's the voice of love! The maidens are attracted and look out their balconies and at the end of the song, they see their lover, who up to that moment, has kept himself hidden and the game is won. For us, silver lire! - That's fantastic! This way, during the season, we'll make a ton of dough! Here's my calling card with my address. Understand? What's wrong? - Enri'? What's the matter? He's crying! Is he mad? The kid isn't mad. He has the heart of an artist! Take care. Gimme your hat! We're all artists here! Is there enough to eat? - All meat and macaroni! Enrico, run! The tax man is at your house. He's repossessing. You dad is going nuts! This is the third time I've come to get the little money you owe me. I'm fed up! If in 5 days, you don't pay me, I'll be forced to repossess! Repossession? Seizure? It's all poverty! Seize me instead! Put me in jail! At least in jail, I have a bed and a piece of bread! I can't do anything more. You've been warned! Am I a lazy man? A bum? No, Sir! I kill myself with working and what do I get it for it? This! The young lord! Now he come! Why should he care? He eats, sleeps like this was a hotel, expecting to become a famous great singer! I wonder why the De Luca shop hasn't sent you away yet! I was sent away. - Sent away? No! Marcellino, no! For the love of God! Yes, go on, defend him! My wife and children against me. I'm leaving or I'll do something I regret! Yes, embrace your fine star. We can eat his songs! Mama! My beautiful mama! What is it? Are you ill? - It's nothing at all. I'm better. It has passed. Forgive me, Mama. I was fired because I was singing. Papa will say I did it on purpose, that I'm lazy. But it's not true! I sing without knowing it. Many times, I don't even realize it. I know, Enrico. Sometimes, you even sing in your sleep. You are so good, Mama. - Papa is good too, Rico. A gentleman and hardworking. Poverty make him insane: two small children, me not well. He has worked his whole life. His father and his father's father have always worked and still they've gone hungry. For you it must be different. The Madonna gave you the voice of angels. She wants you to sing, to save you from misery. You must sing, Rico. - Out of bed again? My dear lady! How can you go on like this, if you don't listen to me? Come, get to bed. I've brought the medicine. My sister expects you tomorrow for the first lesson. Your sister will give him lessons? Do you understand? She's taught the greatest singers in the world! Oh, Doctor, I'll be forever grateful! - Me? It's not my doing. You made him with a beautiful voice. - Mama, I'll become a great singer! Be punctual tomorrow, eh? My sister cares about these things. Come in. - Yes, Ma'am. Wait here. Come closer. - Yes, Ma'am. Sit down. Your name is Caruso. Remain seated. Your first name? - Enrico. Repeat it clearly, by syllables, if you know what that means. En-ri-co. - And born? Yes. - Born when? February 27, 1873. - Where? Vico San Giovanni, no. 7. - Naples, eh? I can hear it in your terrible accent. Why did you get up? Won't you have me sing? - Sit. It'll be a long time before we open that piano and talk about singing. First of all, you must learn to speak, if one day, you want to become like them. Perfect articulation. Melodiousness. Precision of pronunciation. It's not just the voice which makes the true singer. An uneducated voice alone, like yours, leaves you on the same level as animals. Remember well, from this moment on, you must not sing. I can't sing? I'll tell you when the time is ripe. Now, you must study. Let's begin. Exercise for the perfect pronunciation of the letter A. La ragazza Barbara Ala cantava da brava alla Scala. Repeat. - Yes, Ma'am. La ragazza Barbara Ala cantava da brava alla Scala. Now, write it. - Alright. "... cantava da brava alla Scala." And she wouldn't let you sing? She said I talk like an animal. She's nuts! She wants to ruin your career! Listen to me: Why don't you see the man from the cafe? What's his name? Ah, Proboscide! You remember? He'll let you sing and give you money every time you do. No, Mrs Tivaldi has taught the greatest singers. Even papa is happy with her. He says I learn good manners. - What good manners? I can teach you to be a gentleman whenever you want! You must sing, got it? You, in your throat, you're blessed. That is your fortune. Let's go to Proboscide, eh? I want mama! Mama! Mommy! Do you hear me, Mama? - Mrs Anna! Mrs Anna! Bring her to the bed! - I want mama! Get the doctor! - Don't be afraid. I just slipped. Ma'am, keep this baby five minutes. My son! I'll help you. I'll watch over you always. Even if I should leave you. You're tired, poor Anna. But you can't abandon your Enrico. The light of paradise pales before the light of love in your son's eyes. Don't fear being poor and tired while someone needs you. Get up and retake your place. Soon his papa will return and want dinner. Assuntina wants her milk too. - The milk, Enrico. The milk... The pitcher broke. Your papa mustn't know. Don't worry about it, Mama. I'll clean it up. Don't worry. Papa won't find out at all. Come here. That's for the milk! And that's for trying to make a fool out of me! Oh, my God! Sorry, Ma'am, if I were late. My mother is quite sick. I'm sorry but I demand strict punctuality. Today, I've no more time for you. LUIGI GREGORIO PROBOSCIDE - 3rd Floor - Office - Mediations - Business - Advice - Interests - Hearts. Payment in Advance Sweet Caruso! Come here, my angel! I'm very sick, my boy! Almost dying! At my age, a cold like this can have serious consequences! What kind of fever did I have at noon? - 36? C. - Worse than a horse! I'm sorry, I don't want to disturb you. I'll go. - No, sit down. My Teresa, can you bring me something warm? A cup of linden tea? - Yes, linden! It's genuine Gragnano. I drink it like medicine. Pour it down, to protect against contagion. Don't you like wine? - I never drank it before. Sir, I came because of the serenades. Serenades? Forget it! I've got another idea. Then you don't want me to sing? - What do you mean? Of course, I do! But in a grand show that I'm organizing for a charity. It will be fantastic! The brilliant, moving plot is mine, with so many songs by the best authors. You'll be the protagonist! - Me? Pierrot in love with a lovely Colombine. Star-crossed love! Naturally, she's not aware of your feelings. She loves another and your heart is torn to pieces! Poor Pierrot! But suffering gives your voice a new charm. Very moving! Stella! Stellina dear! - Oh, uncle! I didn't know you were ill. Terrible! Maybe on the point of death but I'm very happy to see you. Sit. Uncle, I brought you some cookies. - Well, I might eat a few. Superb! Help yourselves, children! This is Stella, my niece. Every time she wants to see me, she has to break out of prison. - Oh, uncle, you exaggerate! Prison, my girl, prison! Because your father is a cruel jailer. Her father is a well known gentleman but he has nothing but scorn for poor me! Because I became an artist! Look behind this boy's shoulders. What do you see? - Nothing. You don't see silver wings and the voice of an angel? He's Enrico Caruso. Remember that name and shake his hand. Now, come here. You must get dressed because the show is in costume of course. But Luigi! - I'm fine! Art and youth have cured me! Stella! Teresa! Help me! Excellent! - No, it's too big. Fix it. That's what women are for. Stella, help me. - Here I am. We must cut the sleeves. We'll have to shorten the shoulders. Did I hurt you? No, no, Miss. - Look at the collar too. There we go. Now, we must choose Pierrot's songs. What do you know how to sing? You know the new Di Capua song "Voice in the Night?" - Yes. It's so nice, why don't we choose that? "Voice in the Night?" OK. Fine. Stella will listen. Sing for her. What's the matter, my boy? I don't know.... I can't. Ah, I know! Stage fright. It'll pass. But we need to help you. Stellina, will you kindly go away and not look at Enrico while he sings? Yes, Uncle. If this voice that cries in the night, wakes up your husband, don't be afraid. Tell him the serenade is anonymous. Tell him to sleep, to be reassured. Tell him that who sings in this street either he will be mad or die of jealousy. Maybe he's crying for some infamy. He sings alone. But what does he sing for? What do you say to that? What do you think? You've moved her! Made her cry! Magnificent! - Oh, Uncle! It was so beautiful! - Thank you, Niece, but it's he whom you must thank. Giova'! - What is it? What happened? She kissed me! - Who is she? - Stella! The florist in the square? - No! A young lady! She wore a hat. You remember the princess of the carriage? She was like her! And she kissed you? - Yes! Where did she kiss you? - In a house. No but where? The forehead? The nose? The mouth? - The mouth! Be honest, you dreamed this. - No, Giova', I swear it! How was it? - I don't know. I felt happy. And at the same time like crying. - This is love. Love? There, that's done. This is ready too. - And no sign of Enrico yet. What a surprise when he finds out. He never said so but I know. It's his biggest wish. Let's hope he's not too late. - Mama! There he is. - Mama! How are you? Donna Nanni, good day! - Good day, Giovanni! What is this? - What luxury! A queen's dress! Heavens, don't touch! - They're theater costumes. Nunziata is the seamstress for San Carlo. - San Carlo? Yes, I must bring them right away. They're waiting. Donna Nunziata enters the door of the stage, passes among the scenery, goes into the the dressing rooms' hall and delivers the costumes to each singer. And sometimes, they let her watch the show. I can't go tonight. I need to find somebody. Yes, my son, you can go! - Mama! Let's go to San Carlo! Giova'! Let's go to San Carlo! San Carlo! Brush yourself off! How handsome! The costumes! Hey, wait! You can only get in with this! Wait a second! - You first! Rico, you're starving! Won't you take something to eat? Mama, I'm not hungry! - Me too! - Just talk! That one's always hungry! The costumes from Donna Nunziata. - Go on. They're waiting. I'm with him. With him. Get out! Get out! - Help! Help! Let's try the trap door. Let go of me! ...in which flowers will open their blossoms for your bed, Your ear shall hear divine words. Listen! Listen! The spirits of the earth and of the air start for your dream, their sweet concert. In the sky above, your star will shine brightly. Margherita! The charm is working; he is ours! Boy, this is the first time you've seen an opera? - Yes, Miss. You like it? - Very much. But will Faust marry Margherita? No, Margherita dies. She dies... - Yes. But she goes to heaven, you see. Rico! Rico! Rico! - Magnificent, Mama! I want to became a singer too. - Yes, Enrico, a great singer. ...lency. Excellency. Emanuele says, eccentrically. The elegant, eloquent lieutenant. You're decidedly getting worse. Let's start over. Did you hear me? Start over. And this time, do it right. I can't. - I don't want to hear that word! Stop fiddling with that button! Pick it up. You think I don't know why your pronunciation becomes more vulgar? Because you visit Proboscide. And I know you're preparing to sing in a ridiculous show organized by that man. From now on, you won't go to see him. You promise? No. - You don't want to obey me? I want to sing for Mr Proboscide! Get out of this house and don't step foot into it again! What are these marks? - The scenes! Imagination, kids! We need imagination! The theater is the fairy kingdom of imagination! Here will be a lovely garden with a fountain in the middle. Here a palace with a fine balcony, under which Pierrot will sing his melodious song to Colombine, while serving a young lord, his rival. Colombine! - Young lord! Come, Stella, don't waste my time. I'd love to see the show but unfortunately, I'll be away by then. Away? - Yes, she's going. Leaving us. Her father is burying her in a school. What do you think of my show? - It'll be a success. See? And he knows. He's used to seeing great shows. He belongs to a family... maybe they'll help to pay my show. Come, Rico. Let's try, "A Voice in the Night." And please, put all of your feeling into it. I see how you obeyed Miss Tivaldi! - Who are you? Rico's father! - Ooh, a pleasure! You came to hear the rehearsal? You must be proud to hear your son. No, no, let me tell you, this wretch is done with singing! Why? - Why? Ask him! No, Papa! Beat me at home! Don't say anything! But I want everyone to know! This young lord dresses like a clown, flours his face, but doesn't want to work! He told his father, who works from dusk to dawn, that he doesn't! Go on! Go on, play the clown! You can amuse me too! The most entertaining scene in the show. Take off those rags. What's her name? Stella. But she'll never think about me! But you're still a boy, Rico. A woman cannot yet love you. But one day will come when not only one woman will love you, but everybody will love you because of your voice. My voice is a curse! It's brought me nothing but misfortune! I never want to sing again! Never! - Not even for your mama? If you'll sing in the church, I'll be well that day and I'll come to hear you. Will you, Enrico? Yes, Mama. Get better. My clothes! Give me my clothes. I must go... to church. Rico won't sing... ... if I don't come. - No, let's wait for the doctor. He could tell if you can get up. Rico will sing all the same. Even if you don't come. Right, Rico, you'll sing? - Yes. No, I want to hear him too. - No, you can't. I've been waiting for this day so long. - Doctor! Enrico... ... sings in the church today. I'd like to hear his voice... ... one more time. - I'll prepare the medicine. Doctor? Doctor, is there any hope? - She'll hear her son sing. Doctor, I can't... I'm very sorry but I was sent to hear if Enrico is coming to the oratorio. - No! Enrico, you must go. You must sing. Come. Have mercy, Lord, on me, in my remorse. Lord, have mercy. If my prayer rises to you, do not chastise me in your severity. Less harshly, always mercifully, turn your eyes upon me. Upon me. Less harshly, always mercifully, turn your eyes upon me. Never let me be condemned to eternal hellfire by your severity. By your severity. Papa, tomorrow I'll go to the shop with you. Mr Proboscide! How are you? - You're Enrico! I've finally found you! How long since we've met? A long time. - Yes, you were this high. Now raise your head, so I can see you. Why did you forget your friends? No. I didn't forget them. - You smoke? And your voice? I don't sing anymore. - Oh, I understand. You work in a shop. You spoke to my sister once about your mother. I admired very much her character. She believed in your talent, your voice. You must become what she dreamed of. - Passing through! Excuse me! Caruso, it's little I can do for you. - Thank you, Mr Proboscide but I... Fine, no matter when you come: tomorrow or six months from now. But remember, we're waiting for you, my sister and I because we love you. Do you remember Stella? Yes. - She finished her studies and soon will be back in Naples. Luigi Gregorio Proboscide lives at the same address! Be well. Goodbye. Watch, Miss. One more time! - Go to bed or you'll get it! Bravo! Bravo, Giovannino! - Now, no more. Go to bed. Behave. Assuntina will go beddy-bye. Good night. - Now make the sign of the cross. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Good night. - Good night. Hey, Enri', be honest, now we've cleaned the dishes, shall we play a hand? Want to play a hand? - I'm going to bed. No games. My job is hard not like yours. We hafta work even at night. Tonight is papa's turn but tomorrow's mine. OK? But we could still play a hand. One hand and then I'll go. Thanks you for the dishes. Good night. - Good night. Good night, dear mama. ... Lord, on me, in my remorse, Lord, have mercy. If my prayer rises to you, do not chastise me in your... Enri'! You're singing. Not me. It was a dream. Mama was right: you sing even in your sleep. I was wrong. You must sing. And she would be so happy. Bravo! I knew that sooner or later you'd be here. Enrico Caruso must sing! What do you think of my voice? - Magnificent! Some asses will say that it's a baritone but asses will be asses. You must study and perfect your technique. What do you think of Maestro Vergine? Maestro Vergine? Who'll give me money to pay for his lessons? If he likes your voice, money will be of no consequence. I'll tell him about you and the Maestro will hear you. You really think so, Cavaliere? - I most certainly do! I also think you're a lucky young man. You see these cups and these sweets? There's a certain person who's coming to visit us. Stella? Miss Stella? Yes, you said it right the first time: Stella. Aunt Teresa! - Oh, Stella, my girl, you've grown so beautiful! Come on, Teresa! She didn't come to see you! Go, prepare the chocolate! Oh, Uncle, how happy I am to see you! You're all of Naples to me! Look who's here! You see who it is? You recognize him? I recognized him too after many years. There's something in him you can't forget. Am I the only one talking? What? You see each other after so long and don't say a word? How are you, Miss? - Fine, thank you. And you? He's fine, can't you see? And today, even better. He'll take up singing again. Oh, I'm very happy! When I found out that... ... after once in church, you never wanted to sing again, I was very pained. Do you remember the first time we met? You had stage fright. I had to go away and not look at you. While you sang, I cried. Maybe you've already forgotten? No. I haven't forgotten. And when I finished singing, you... Go on. Say it. - You kissed your uncle. You've a good memory! - That's not all: I say that kiss didn't happen to me. Really? I don't remember. - Then you kissed him. Right, Rico? Yes. - Impossible. You're mistaken. Mistaken, my foot! You kissed him! And he ran away embarrassed. We were children then. Happy. Rico, do you remember the song? If this voice wakes you up at night, while you're holding your husband close, stay awake, if you want to be awake but pretend to be fast asleep. Don't go to the window to take a peek Because you can't mistake it. This voice is mine. It's the same voice from when both of us, tentatively, addressed each other as "Sir" and "Miss." Bravo, Rico! Oh, is that you, Goffredo? Stella's here too! Come inside! Her father. - Luigi, look who's here? Dear Goffredo, I didn't expect to see you. I've been all over Naples looking for you. I've should've known whom you visit first. would be to your uncle. - She's very sweet if you don't mind. Even if I do mind, it seems. - Please, don't fight. Mr Caruso. - A pleasure. He studies song. As a child, he sang wonderfully. And tomorrow, Vergine will hear him! Stella, remember at 6, we must be at the Baroness Cangemi's house. She can at least have a cup of chocolate? I'm sorry, but we really can't be late. It was a pleasure. Goodbye, Luigi. Mama, Stella. My son has spoken so much about you, I feel I already know you. Come, sit down. As you see, my description is inferior to the reality. Sir, I've a request to make regarding Stella. I hope you won't refuse me. Surely not, Baroness. I'd be very pleased to invite you to our house in Sicily. Will you come? - We are very grateful for the honor, Baroness. But will the Miss not mind leaving Naples? Of course not. I've never been to Sicily and it would be a pleasure for me. Love forbids you to not love. Your soft hand, which rejects me, seeks the tight grip of my hand. Your pupils express, "I love you." Though your lip says, "I won't love you!" Bravo! Another song, Maestro? - No, thank you, that's enough. My friend, Proboscide, has spoken very well of you. But... do you expect great things from your voice? Yes, Sir. Else, I wouldn't have come to you. Then, read this. And if you agree, sign it. It's a contract binding you to me for 5 years. If you earn more than 20,000 lire, 25% of that will go to me. 20,000? - Then it's... Don't delay, I've a class starting soon. Sign it. Hurry, sign it! - Yes. Enrico Ca-Ru-so. We're rich! We're rich! I'll be your secretary, OK? - Fine. Go tell Proboscide. Please, study hard! Madonna is with you. Bye. - Yes, bye! Who's that? Do you know? I've never seen him, he must be new. Probably a discovery of the Maestro. But isn't he a carpenter? I bet at the lesson's end, he'll ask if we have any locks that need repair! You sit over there. And you go in the back. "Oh, Paradise" from The African. For the modulation of the voice and for transitions from woodwinds to piano. Come up here. Show these turkeycocks how it's done. Oh new world, you belong to me. You belong to me. To me. A FURTIVE TEAR I can't ask for more. I can't ask. I can die of love. SHE APPEARED TO ME FULL OF LOVE She appeared to me full of love. My eyes caught sight of her, so beautiful that my heart flew to her with longing. Marta, Marta, you have vanished and my heart gone with you. You have stolen my peace of mind. I shall die of grief. I shall die of grief. Yes! I'll die! You wish you could sing like that, you turkeys of San Carlo! Welcome back, Commendatore! - Goodbye. Bye. Commendatore, how are you? - How did you know I was arriving today? Your sister told us. I've been taking mudbaths and I'm worse off than before. - Goodbye, Sir. A nice massage, Commendatore? - How are the lessons with Vergine? Uh, fine. The Maestro seems content. And you say so with such a face? What's the matter? Nothing. Finally, you've found him. We've come here sometimes to get news of... - Great Scott! You care so much for my health? Tell the truth, was it because of that? Tell him, he'll understand, right, Sir? It's because of your niece, Stella. Sorry. Commendatore, I've nothing to do with it. Cat got your tongue, Enrico? Speak. No, what does that have to do with it? I just simply wanted to know how is... What? You haven't been able to see her? Whenever I have free time, I'm always at her door hoping to see her but I never do. And when he's not free, he sends me in his place. - My dear boy, Stella is gone. - Gone? - Gone into Sicily. Sicily? Why? Stella and her father are guests of a baroness, a certain Cangemi. She says she's fine. - But why did she uh... A letter! "A lovely house, very nice." Ah, here it is: "I miss you very much." My absence! "If you get a chance to see Enrico, salute him for me. P.S." "Is Rico doing well with Maestro Vergine?" What? Now, you're smiling? Thanks, Cavaliere. I'm running now to my lessons. Did she say when she'd return? Sunday, the 25th! - The day after tomorrow? That's right! Hurray! Until the day after tomorrow! Oh, look who's here! What a lucky coincidence! She just got here and had to see her uncle, despite her strict father. Do you have any commitments. Must you go? - No, no commitments. That's fine. We can take a stroll together, if you like? Go there! Did you have fun in Sicily? Yes, there were some lovely places. But I'm very happy to see Naples again. Where are we going? - I don't know. Wherever you like. - Any preference? I'd gladly have a chocolate cream but not here where we are suffocating. We need a small place, a bit retired. Let's go towards Posillipo. Commendatore! Wait, I'll be right there! - Who? Me? Sorry, it's very important business. I need to speak to this very dear friend. Don't go away, Commendatore! You go ahead, I beg you. No, we'll wait for you. - For heaven's sake! Go on! Goodbye! Goodbye. Excuse me, why did you make signs for me to wait? You don't even know me! What do you want? To express the gratitude of me and those young people going to get a chocolate, together, happy and in perfect health. My respects, Commendatore. How nice! - Miss, you want one? - How much for a kilo? Not a kilo! I just want to eat one. - Eat one, it's as lovely as you. And for you. - Thank you. Fresh apples! Do you have a knife? - No, why? - To peel the skin. There's no need. Watch, this is how you do it. You're right. It's better this way. And just think, how many years I've been taught to peel fruit with a knife and fork. A fork? How high up we are. We can't even hear the sounds of the city. I can even see our house. Where's yours? - You can't see mine 10 mt away. Over there. Among that pile of houses. Poor people's houses. One day, they'll write, "Here lived the great singer, Enrico Caruso." I'd be glad if they didn't write anything, unless I could change it immediately. I'd love to have here a fine house, full of the sun and of light. Before the sea. With lots of chairs and rugs. For that, I'd vow to eat fruit with a knife and a fork too. If I had a house like that, I could even travel. Sometimes, I go to the station to see the trains depart. You know that I'm all grown up and never have been on a train? When they depart, I imagine myself aboard, visiting new countries, new cities. This happens to me when I sing too. It's as if my voice travels far away... ... to many people, I can't see but who can hear me and say my name. A sea of people. It's funny when somebody like me has dreams like that, right? - No. It's beautiful to be able to dream and hope for great things. And I'm sure all your dreams will come true. All? All. If you wish it with your whole heart. You'll stay now in Naples? I hope so. - Then, we'll see each other again? This afternoon was like if it were outside of time. As if only yesterday we were at Uncle Luigi's. - I felt the same thing. But so many years have passed. Maybe Uncle Luigi has found us. He's taken a carriage. See? I was right. Stop! There they are! The Commendatore kept me. Luckily, I was lucky enough to run into your papa after and I had to tell him... And this is the kid who offered to get you an ice cream? I think I've seen him before. Yes, at my home. - Ah, yes. Studying song, if I'm not mistaken. And he has a great future, I assure you! - I'm quite pleased. And now Stella, we must go. Coming? - Yes, papa. Goodbye, Enrico. What will you do? Go on foot? - Don't worry. We'll keep on walking. Be well, Goffre'. May Madonna be with you. Goodbye, Luigi. Let's go. Well, this time the jailer came too late. Did you spoke to her clearly? I could never aspire to Stella. - Why? What happened? Didn't you see how her father treated me? - So what? You know how he is. I'm asking about her. - Stella is a lady. She sees people different from me. Barons. I have callouses from the shop! - You have inside of you glory, riches! All the baronial crowns of this world! You just need to step foot on stage and the barons will shine your shoes! When your name appears on posters, you'll be a golden catch! And my brother-in-law will be honored to give you Stella! You just need to sing. You just need to make yourself known! An audition now would be suicide. - But I want to make my debut, Maestro. I'm ready now. You know it. It's not a caprice nor presumption. I swear that it's necessary. All of my life depends on this. If you don't give me this audition, I'll go back to the shop and study no more! And you dare speak to me like that? You? You who made me repent 100 times I ever took you into my school! I'll have the impresario Daspuro hear you at the Mercadante. Maestro! He already knows you. He's spoken of you as my best pupil. Thank you, Maestro! Leave me alone, now! I'm getting shaved. You wanted to speak to me, Papa? - Yes. Sit down. Baroness Cangemi has asked me officially for your hand, on behalf of her son. Now it's up to you to set the date. Why such hurry, Papa? Couldn't we wait a bit? I think not. The Cangemi wish the marriage will happen as soon as possible. And even I'll be more at ease, when I see you married and happy. That's just it, Papa, happiness. Everybody has their own way. Yes, it's true, Cangemi is the best catch a girl like me could hope for. But I'd have to live in that old house, in those sad, silent, dark rooms. It frightens me. But, my dear, you're no longer a child and the time for romance is over. The other day, at Posillipo, I didn't say anything to you. I don't even want think that Caruso could influence your state of mind. Just kid stuff but dangerous to your good name, to the gravity in your commitment to Baron Cangemi and even for that tenor. He's a boy and he's just starting to make his way. Tomorrow, he has an audition in San Carlo. He needs to dedicate himself completely to his career. At his age, it's easy to get in over your head. But you are already 24 years old. How sad, to feel so old at 24 and have to renounce so many dreams. Please, the public aren't allowed in the auditions. If you're seen, it's my job. Thank you. Listen to me, eh? Go slow with those high notes. Think of it as managing an egg which mustn't crack on the ceiling. And when you pass the sol, don't raise your head like a rooster but lower it instead, placing it on the larynx. What is it? Do you feel sick? I'm afraid. - Afraid? Of what? Of everything: the audition, the public. - There isn't any public! I know but one day there'll be. - Want to drink something? Drink? Are you crazy? Want to ruin him? And you're always in the way! Get out! Dear Vergine! Your singer is lucky. He has the honor to sing before Maestro Leoncavallo. The author of "I Pagliacci?" Then if the Maestro permits, we'll begin right away. - Please. Good morning, Maestro Vergine. - Good morning. Who's that? - A music critic. A critic? - Yes, but... Allow me. - Who are you? What's with the boy? Jaundice? Why? It's his normal color, no? An ugly color. - Look who's talking. What will you honor us with? An aria from "I Pagliacci." - Excellent. Look, a mute singer! That jinx! Be brave, you're among Christians. Perform the play! While I am racked with grief, not knowing what I say or what I do! And yet... I must... ah, force myself to do it! Bah! You are not a man! You are "Pagliaccio." Put on the costume, the powder and the paint: the people pay and want to laugh. And if Harlequin steals away your Colombine, laugh, Pagliaccio, and all will applaud you! Change all your tears and anguish into clowning. And into a grimace, your sobbing and your pain! Laugh, Pagliaccio, at your shattered love! Laugh at the sorrow that has rent your heart! Enrico! Bravo! Great! Great! You're the greatest interpreter of my opera in the world! Thank you, Maestro. - What a great idea the sob is at the end. I didn't think that, it just came out so. Everybody should sing it like that! Bravo! Oops! Excuse me! I didn't do it on purpose! I'll engage you for my tour in Sicily! I'm Callaro, the famous Callaro! I'll launch you in an amazing way! I'll make your fortune. You'll sing in all of Sicily: Palermo, Catania, Syracuse, Trapani! All of the best cities in the best theaters! A first class company! If you want, we can sign a contract now. - Thanks but I've other plans for him. No, you can't refuse! I offer you a chance... Excuse me, is there a salary? Salary? Fine, if you want, a salary. But who are you? I'm the secretary of the great tenor, Enrico Caruso: Giovanni Palma. A pleasure. Let's talk it over! Listen, this is the most difficult moment of your life. To truly win, you must do 3 things: study, study and study! Maestro, I must... - Don't rush! And especially don't give any heed to parrots like Callaro. Be patient for a few weeks more, maybe a few months more. And when the time comes, I'll introduce you to Zucchi. Zucchi? My dear, opera has become a black market. The players are treated like merchandise and the impresarios are just sellers. Only Francesco Zucchi remains a faithful servant of art. My usual. An aperitif for Zucchi! I'll show it next season: fine operas, fine voices and the finest mis-en-scenes. Good day. I'm Caruso. Who? Enrico Caruso. - Don't shout. I hear perfectly. Maestro Vergine spoke about me, correct? - Vergine? Then you must have a small voice. It's Vergine's mania to reduce his students' voices as small as mice. Caruso's is like an elephant! - What? I owe everything to the Maestro Vergine. It's he who taught me to sing. His recommendation is still a privilege. Would you like to debut in the next season I'm preparing for San Silvestro? What? So late? - When do you want it to begin? I prepare the seasons carefully but they are seasons one always remembers. In a few days, you can sign the contract? - Excuse me, what about the pay? Shut up! - Tell me your name again. Enrico Caruso. - Caruso. Goodbye. Ah, listen: that sob in "I Pagliacci". Great idea. Just nonsense! Not important. - Goodbye. "What? What?" He acts deaf when he pleases but he knew about that sob! One moment! There's Proboscide, I want to him hear the news! Cavali'! Cavali', wait! Don Luigi! Cavali'! - Commendato'! Commendato'! Get out of the way! Cavaliere, great news! What is it? Aren't you happy to see me? Of course not! I'm in a hurry... What did you want to tell me? - No, I want you to be frank with me. Is it about Stella? - Eh? But... Are you hiding something from me? Is she sick? What is it then? Talk to me, Cavaliere! She's married! She went to Sicily just to marry Baron Cangemi. I didn't know a thing. I love her very much and she wasn't even frank with me. She didn't want to wait for me. She had no faith in me. But I'm convinced it wasn't her fault. It was her father, you see! You mustn't despair. You have a future! I won't despair. Have no fear of that. Enrico? Where are you going? Who knows? Mr Callaro, you made me a proposal to tour in Sicily? You haven't changed your mind? - I hold by my word. But I won't hide from you that I'm in talks with the best tenors in the country who would pay to join me. Your tour includes Trapani? - Trapani is in Sicily, isn't it? I accept. - Excellent! Excuse me, the pay? - You're obsessed with pay, aren't you? Well, I'll give you 8 lire a show. If you sing every night, that's 240 lire a month, OK? No, that won't do! What? 8 lire when Tamagno gets 2000, and Battistini gets 1000 lire at La Scala? Tamagno? Battistini? Of course, I take off my hat to them. Everyone knows them. But I will make this boy famous! He'll sing lead in the finest operas in my repertory! Let's say, 300. OK? - No. 600: Take it or leave it. 300 lire a month. Travel expenses paid. Food and lodging not included. And I congratulate you on this wonderful contract. A done deal! A done deal! - A done deal. Mr Callaro? - What is it? - Sign up my friend too. Fine, but what can he do? - I can do everything. I'm an artist, soloist, stagehand, assistant, arranger and guitar player! I'm the factotum of the city. You're coming with me, Mommy. I'm not leaving you behind. Who is this Caruso? Callaro is mad to hire another tenor! A kid! An unknown! I'm Giorgi, the company's tenor! I won't tolerate this affront! I'll rip up the contract in their faces! Callaro would love that and you know it. You think I should keep quiet? No, no, I can't. It's stronger than me! And you should understand. Are you my wife or not? - Ah, yes. Tie me up. As for Callaro, I'll strangle him! I'll take his breath away! - It's better I talk to Callaro. Then it's all settled, dear Callaro? What is that noise? This is the trunk of your company's tenor, no? Not "the", "a!" Let's get things right, young man. In the Callaro Company, there are 2 tenors: Giorgi and Caruso! Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Your pleasant image no one will ever forget it. Of the resplendent blue of the sky is the peaceful sea. The heart that does not get drunk doesn't enjoy pleasures. The sky, the earth and the air speak of love. You alone in my pain. I will dream of consolation. Yes, I will dream. Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye, cherished memories of the time that has passed. Another sky calls me. Goodbye, goodbye. But this heart desires you and my heart I will give you. Your air is full of kisses and harmony. Oh, magical mermaid, I will be faithful to you. Whenever I think of those moments, return more tenderly joys and memories of my happy days. Yes! My happy days. Goodbye, my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye, cherished memories of the time that has passed. Goodbye my beautiful Naples. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye, cherished memories of the time that has passed. AN EVENING IN HONOR OF FIORELLO GIORGI THE LEAD FIORELLO GIORGI Invaders are coming! War! War! Love! Love! Love! Tickets, Sir. Il Comunale is a fine theater. Yes, I saw it 5 years ago. It was great. How much time until Trapani? - 3/4 of an hour. 3/4? - 3/4 of an hour to go. Excuse me. - Tickets please. Tickets. Excuse me. Well? What is it? Mr Callaro, I'd like to speak to you. What is so urgent? - In a while, we'll be in Trapani. Well? Thank you, boy! I know that! Is that why you disturbed me? Mr Callaro, you signed me on as the lead. Instead up to now, I've played generic, secondary roles. I've done it for your good! To get you used to the stage, make you less shy. You promised me that I could sing Chenier at Trapani but yet Giorgi's singing. I'm doing for a good reason too. The place is new for us and important. Chenier needs stage presence, experience. You have two fine parts. You have the Abb? and the Incredible. I beg you, Mr Callaro, let me sing at Trapani. After, I'll be the prop-man, if you want. I don't understand. There'll be other opportunities for me to keep my word. And you will thank me. - Fine, then don't give me any part. What are you thinking? The posters are ready! You must be joking? No, Mr Callaro, if I can't play the lead at Trapani, I won't sing! Don't you see, young man, if you refuse... Yes, I know. You have all the rights. Make a complaint, rip up my contract! I don't care about anything! For all the fine career your company has given me! - And I will! I will! Contracts are contracts, my dear! Don't yell or you'll wake up Giorgi! Everybody got off. What are we doing? Then you've made up your mind? You're not going to the theater? Excuse me. Excuse me. But this Caruso isn't singing tonight. Too bad. A friend told me he has a nice voice. Have they substituted a singer? - Yes, Baron, but for a minor role. Baroness. Some manners! How are you? Better? Take some more! It's just nerves! Make a little effort! He's completely hoarse. We must give back the money. - What? Give back the money? I'll sing before that! No, there must be a remedy! Let's try some hot packs of flaxseed. - Really? No, the hot packs work well! I cured my uncle with them! Let me do it! I'll get it ready! - But not too hot, eh? Lukewarm! Lukewarm! - Lukewarm! Don't worry! When do they start? They're 20 minutes late. Dear, don't you feel well? - No. No, it's nothing. It's laryngitis. His voice will be back in a few days. A few days? But he must sing tonight! - Impossible. This will do wonders! Give it to me! - No, let me do it. Try this, please. - Is it too hot? No, it's lukewarm. They really make miracles! Doctor... - He can't sing. He has no voice. It'll take a few days. Now what can we do? We must stop the performance. - And the theater sold out? Let's get another singer. - Caruso? - Not him! I'd rather die. - Give back the money then. Call Caruso. - Are you mad? - Excuse me! There he is. Enrico! Oh, Jesus, he's drunk! You must come to the theater. - I'm not! You must get to the theater right away. - I don't want to hear about it! I'll never step foot into it again. The theater is garbage! You must sing in the theater. There isn't much time! Rico. Rico, listen to me. The tenor Giorgi is sick. The part is yours. Understand? Yours. - What are you saying? Giorgi is sick? - Yes, very sick! Callaro begs you to take his place! Let's go, for the love of God! Rico, this is a rare opportunity. You must get dressed. Let's go. We're going? Great. - I accept but only on one condition. Yes, but let's go. - That all my friends get to come free! Free? OK, let's go. - Let's go, guys! Come on! "Your request, mademoiselle, is for me a command." "Yet, alas ! Sweet Fancy's coy," "or humble prayers." - "Your request is a humble prayer." Don't look at the public and pay attention to the orchestra! "Most capricious is the muse, as fanciful as love." - "The maze..." Not maze! Muse! You know who came in the theater? The Impresario Zucchi. Zucchi! He chose a fine evening! Damn it! Listen, everything depends on you. Don't make me look bad! Give me something to drink. I'm thirsty. - Cognac! Cognac! He's drunk as a skunk! He's ready. He's ready! He'll be right out! If you forget a line, remember the prompter. And if you can't understand him, make something up but don't stop! You understand me? Do not stop! Enri', are you afraid? Afraid of what? - Remember Stella's in the theater. San Gennaro, give him strength. He's up, by Jove! A good luck charm. - Go on! Go on! Da capo! Da capo! Da capo! Go towards the Countess! Your muse is melancholy, so it seems. Indeed, 'twas scarcely courteous. He's so eccentric. Behold our poet! I'll make him rhyme, I warrant! Shall we wager? Callaro mistook Chenier for a ballet! I'd kill to know who gave him that horseshoe! I would pray you to pardon my seeming boldness. A woman, as you know, is nothing, if not curious. Will you not favour us with something of your own? Some harmless poem that might amuse a school-girl? "Your request..." Your request, mademoiselle, is for me a command. Yet, alas ! Sweet Fancy's coy, No, don't look at me! Look at her! Her! Wretch! Most capricious is the Muse, as fanciful as Love! Why, he's drunk! You! And you! And yes, you too. And you, often speak unaided by the Muses. Your scorn hath touched me here, where jealously are guarded all the secrets of the soul inviolate. You shall know, now, fair maiden, what a poem lies in that little word "love", by you thus derided! Stop! Drop the curtain! I'll sue him for damages! Wretch! I've never had so much fun in my life! - This is not an opera but a farce! It's painful to see the fall of a colleague, even one I can't esteem like Callaro. But theater is serious business. - Of course. Drunkard! Son of a drunkard! Get out of my theater! Get out! And the show? What shall we do? - Postpone it! Postpone it, my foot! I wont accept this fiasco! Find someone to sing! Someone else? Who? Me? You? A fireman? Or your Giorgi, who's sick? He has a 40? C fever! He's dying! - The one who's dying is me! I'm ruined! Why not let Oddoro sing? - Oddoro? He's the clown! He's a tenor though. - Please! A silly idea! A good idea! He has experience! He'll save us! You'll double my pay, if I gotta sing with him! - Double pay! She wants to ruin me! - They're destroying the theater! Get Oddoro! Oddoro! Oddoro! Come with me! I'm here! "Oddoro, with a golden voice!" Cangemi, let's go into the foyer to hear the comments. Are you coming too? No, I prefer to stay. - Want me to bring you something? No, thank you. - Excuse me, dear. Baroness, come to us. Yes, thank you. Later. He was drunk! He didn't know which way to turn! He was holding on to everything! - There he is! Drunkard! Drunkard! I'd like to speak to the tenor Caruso. - He left a little while ago. Poor guy, he seemed mad. - I must see him. He went that way. Rico! Rico, no! Rico! How shameful! I can't go on living! - I've done you much wrong. Listen, Rico, what happened is my fault. I've always was wrong. Even when I saw you in Naples, I thought you were still a boy. I never imagined you next to me. Only tonight, I realized that I love you. That I will always love you. - Stella! I'll pay for my mistakes. I'll never be happy again. And this will be the only time. - Stella! Because this is the last time, we'll see each other, Rico. We'll never meet again. But you'll always have your mother with you. Rico, what will you do now? I'm going back to Naples tonight. I'll work at the shop. Papa is now old. I'll take his place. As long as your voice wants it. That's who's in command. Your voice doesn't belong to you but you belong to it. You can lower yourself but not your voice. Everything good in you is expressed in it. And if one day you lose it, you won't be able to live. You'll be far from me but wherever you sing, I'll always be close to you. Like her: your mother. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Forgive me. Enri'! Enri'! Enri'! They didn't want Oddoro! - They want you and no one else! Yes! - But how is it possible? They want you or they'll break everything! Callaro promised that you will sing! Don't argue! There he is! Where were you? - It's Caruso! You believe me now? Bravo! Dear! Hurry! For heaven's sake, be quick! "Your request, mademoiselle, is for me a command." I know the part thoroughly. I don't need prompting! Make me look good, I'll pay you royally! I'll bring you to Palermo, Naples! But sing, for the love of God! Don't sing a wrong note, this time. I won't. Enrico, touch it! - I don't need it. I gazed over the blue expanse of heaven unclouded. Over fields with violets enameled. The world around, above me, in glimmering golden glory was shrouded. The spacious earth seemed as one mighty gem. Enclosed within her casket, the boundless heaven! Softly from earth, to me as a greeting, there floated upon the wanton breezes a caress! Then, in a transport I cried, Ah ! I love thee, my country, divine in all thy beauty, oh, land, mine own! Swift through a church-door then I passed. I crossed the threshold of a church A priest collected offerings for the Virgin, by all the faithful given. Yet never heeded nor heard its piteous pleading of one poor aged beggar, with hands held out in vain! And then a workman's hut I entered, where one in desperation loudly cursed his country. He cursed his rich employers to God above in fury and unto men he hurled them, his children's bitter tears! Ah! ye pampered patricians, how do ye right all this wrong? 'Twas in your eyes alone, Oh, lovely maiden, that gentle pity seemed to dwell, And so I turned to you, as to an angel fair and said, "Love from out those beauteous eyes is shining!" But when, as in scorn you addressed me, 'twas then that my heart by grief anew was shaken! Believe me, beauteous maiden, the word of a poet, oh, despise not. Oh, hearken! Naught do you know of love! Hear me, love is divine. Spare it your scorn. The flame that lights the universe, 'tis love! I'll pay you 600 lire a month, expenses included! OK? Make way! Make way! Sir! Sir! Do you remember me? - Mr Zucchi. From now on, you'll be under my charge. What's your name? - Caruso, Enrico. From now, they'll call you Enrico Caruso and with this name, you'll conquer the world. Thus rang the theaters, the public, the signs, the papers, the telegraphs, trumpeting the glory the world over: Enrico Caruso. He will encompass in his extraordinary and fascinating voice, all the sentiment, the poetry, the music, the passion, the magic of his Naples. My cherished memories of the time that has passed.
