PATH OF FIRE Don't look here, son. Look over there. The world worships the rising Sun for it's the source of light for the whole world. But Dad, the Sun gives us light only during the day. But the nights are lit up in the city, isn't that so, Daddy? Do people in the city worship the lights of the night? People in the city pray for wealth, not for the light of the day. And those who are enamored of wealth live a life of lies -and they often go astray -Why so, Daddy? Because the path of truth is difficult to tread upon. It's the path of fire, Agneepath. -Agneepath? -Don't you remember the poem? Oh yes! I remember. ''O' traveler on the path through fire'' ''Should you ever find a tree on your way'' ''Seek not even the shade of a leaf'' "For the path leads through fire" ''Tread tirelessly and without rest upon the path of fire'' -"Make unto yourself that promise.'' -Oh no! -Promise that! -all right! I promise. ''For traveler, you tread upon the path through fire'' I forgot the next lines, Daddy. ''Thus he wades through a sea of tears, sweat and blood'' ''For the traveler, treads upon the path through fire'' What does that stanza mean, Daddy? Son, to reach one's destination when a man passes the test of fire by blood, toil, sweat and tears. Then, no obstacle can stand in the way of what he seeks. I won't forget this poem ever. I promise. -That's good, Son. -Hello there, schoolmaster! Electricity is coming to our village. The engineer is here already. Shiksha! Hey, Shiksha! How many times have I told you, Vijay, not to run about! Watch your step! -Hey Siksha! -What's up, Brother? Why! You're still sitting beside the lamp! Just forget it! Very soon, Sun will be shining in our home. -What do you mean? -Electricity is coming to our village! This is Mr. Mathur, the chief engineer. -Greetings, Sir. -He's here for the electricity project. Till the project is completed, he'll stay as a guest in our house. -Please come inside, Mr. Mathur. -Thank you. Electricity will bring about a renaissance of a new India in our village. -Oh yes. -Please come along. This is the school for the children. It's necessary to have electricity in here. Hey lady! What are you doing! Is that a garbage dump? -That must be H-A-T hat, right? -Yes, son. You're well-regarded here, school master. The people not only respect me but also love me. Bloody swine! -Nathu, have you gotten drunk again? -Yes, I am drunk! Bloody swine! You told my wife not to give me money... ...not to give me money, for a drink! You scoundrel! Is it your money? -Don't. -Aren't you ashamed? Nathu! If you are so enraged... ...you may hit me on the other cheek too. Will you have your wife do menial jobs for a living? Must your children berate their fate for having been born to you? Is that the way you discharge your duty as a father? Instead of caring for her, you snatch money from her and beat her up? I can't live without the booze. You have been born of this earth, as we all are. Can't you shoulder the responsibility of your family, when the earth bears the burden of all life? Is the earth so weak that it will be drowned in liquor! You must do something, Boss. These developments aren't good for us. We'll lose control over the village. I know! The winds of progress are picking up force. I must get a hold on my fiefs. Else, I'll be blown away. The money I've given you, Dinkar Rao, was issued by the government of India. It's worth far more, than the scrap of paper you've given me in exchange. You've tried to sell me the lands which belong to the villagers. -You see, Sir. -Enough of it. You may keep the money. I don't take back what I have given. My principle is profit. For the sake of profit, I will even accept a lie as the truth. And I'll make friends of my enemies. -Get that? -Forgive me for having told lies, Kancha. But you didn't tell me the truth, either. You didn't tell me that you want to use this place for smuggling and dealing in stuff like opium and hashish. You're right. This village of yours, Mandwa, is nowhere on the map of India. This place is close to Bombay yet it is beyond the reach of Indian laws. This place is ideally suited for my shady business. Yeah, I hear there is a schoolmaster in this village, who is trying to get electricity in here. If anything like that happens I'll be sorely disappointed. And, it'll cost you your life. Get that? Who should I tell? How should I tell? Who should I tell? The heart feels weird today Schoolmaster! Is that the result of my untiring efforts in trying to educate you? I had taught you about the paradise beneath mother's feet. And here you are seeking hell in the house of a prostitute! Get out of here! Before your character is destroyed like dried leaves on fire. Get out! You've destroyed many homes. You've destroyed many young lives. And now, you're dragging the children into your sins. -You should be ashamed of yourself! -Why must I be ashamed, master? Brothels are the creation of men. They force helpless women into prostitution. Stop talking nonsense! That person is a coward to follow the path of sin as guided by the other and lose their innocence in the way It's easy for you to preach, because you aren't involved. If you're man enough you will drag me out of this world of sin. If you really are man enough, bring your books in this brothel and tell me of the good and the evil. ''If you're man enough you will drag me out of this world of sin'' Haven't you been able to memorize the alphabet yet! You worthless! Don't hurt her, Daddy. It's my fault. I couldn't teach her properly. I've been irresponsible. Beat me if you will. Son, you want to take a punishment for your sister's fault? You have taught me that I must stand the test of fire. The path of fire. That on this path, if I have to, I shall take the burden of others. Well said, son. I teach the world, but today you taught me my teachings. Raja has laid eyes on your bungalow Raja has laid eyes on your bungalow You wanted to be taught in this brothel, right? I accept the responsibility of teaching you, from now onwards. Don't you eye me! Go ask your father who spent last night at the brothel. Everyone in the village saw him there. Understand? -Vijay! Did you hit him? -Yes. Why? Apologize to him. Go on! -I won't apologize. -Won't you? Tara bai, the darkness of this night must overshadow the respect and esteem of schoolmaster. And, tomorrow morning, he must walk in disgrace. He must be a broken man by tomorrow. And he may never raise his head again. It will be done, boss. Please don't visit the brothel anymore. Those who tread upon the path of truth should never care for wagging tongues. So as to dispel the darkness it's necessary to fire the lamp. -There goes the schoolmaster. -He isn't as innocent as he seems. The villagers are casting aspersions upon the schoolmaster. They say that the schoolmaster is up to no good. I told them that the schoolmaster would rather die than commit a sin. The schoolmaster is at home right now, isn't he? He must have gone to Chanda bai's brothel! -Where's the schoolmaster? -Come on! let's take a look. -Where's the bloody preacher? -But I'm telling you he won't-- -Look at him, now! -What a shameless fellow! -Sleeping with a prostitute! -What a shame! We respected him! And this is what he turns out to be! -Get up, you hypocrite! -Drag that shameless fellow out! Burn the master's house! -Daddy! -Vijay! Daddy! Mom! No! This is the path through fire. No! Killed him! You have killed him. You have killed the schoolmaster. He cared for you as long as he lived. And now you've killed him! No one even cares for his corpse. Swine! Cowards! Fools! Animals! There goes schoolmaster, Dinanath. What are you staring at Vijay? Don't even look at that village. Forget that you were born over there. No! I will never forget that village. Someday, I'll give that village to my mother. For sure. -So you've received your pay. -Yes, Sir. Now get lost. We're going to ambush Kancha Cheena. -Return to your beat after one hour. -all right Then you can investigate his death. Now get out of here. -Greetings, Sir. -We'll take care of your family. -Now just get on with your work. -Take that and that. And make sure you don't foul up. Now get going. -The dog! He escaped. -The swine escaped us! How did he find out? From now on, this is our home, Mummy. This is where we are going to live. Get out! The merchandise arrives tonight. Take care of it. Let's move. Kancha Cheena. Lord Ganesha, bless us. Come again speedily next year. Don't splash the water. I'm getting wet. Come! Come! Come inside! What happened Mom! -Don't beat him. -Move away! I have taken your complaint, haven't l? When are you going to arrest the manager of the petrol pump? I know very well what I'm supposed to do! I've been in this job for 10 years. And now, you're trying to teach me! -Get out of here! -Bloody cop! And you do take bribes. Did you hear that? That boy talks too much! Wonder what he'll make when he grows up. The fellow who burnt Kancha Cheena's petrol pump, -we have found out about him. -Who is he? A twelve-year old boy. -A 12-year old! -A very smart kid. He set the petrol pump afire to avenge his insult to his mother. -What a kid! -Usman brother! Let's bail the kid out and put him to work for us. You'd rather think it over. The boy is much too spirited. He could wipe us out once he grows up. Wrong, Shetty. Help him out now and he'll remain a faithful dog forever. -He's right. -Go on, Terelin take a decision. You don't understand, Shetty! Bail the boy out and we're one up on our opponent. -Get him off the hook. -And he'll remain faithful forever. -Fat head Shetty won't understand! -All right, do what you please. Do you know that it's a crime to set petrol pumps on fire? And what was it that had been done to my mother? Wasn't that a crime? You could've lodged a complaint at the police station. Is that so? Well, I did that. I did report it. But what did you do about it? Nothing. You did nothing at all. And that's why I did it. I burnt it! I burnt the petrol pump. What's your name? Vijay Dinanath Chavan. That's my full name. Dinanath Chavan was my father. My mother is Suhasini Chavan. I'm from the village of Mandwa. I'm 36 years, nine months and eight days old and 16 hours as of now. -Won't you mend you ways? -And why should I? The world is a bad place, Mr. Gaitonde. One must be crooked to survive in this world. Anyone who mends his ways, is bound to die. Did you know that? Keep the advice for your underlings in your hutments. Your underlings worship you. You are the Godfather. And you're the Boss. But you're racing towards your death. That's because your bosses... ...don't like to be refused. -You've started refusing them too. -To come up in life -it is necessary to refuse some things. -This measure of self-promotion could be quite dangerous, Vijay. You are involved in all their rackets. But you've refused to get involved with narcotics. That's because you hate narcotics, just as I do. -Look Vijay, I want to help you. -No, thank you. I don't need your help. Understand! And what exactly are you trying to tell me? Are you telling me that they are planning to kill me today? But, I know the exact time when they want to kill me. Let me show you! Take a look at this. Do you see what's written in there? 6 'O' CLOCK - DEATH. This evening at six, I have an appointment with death. An appointment! Hear that? I can also speak English, you know. And now, I must take your leave. Three more hours to go, Usman. Think it over again, if you may. all Vijay Chavan wants, is the top chair. Let's just give it to him. -Don't bring trouble in here. -Bloody coward! If you are so scared, why did you get into this business? With Vijay at the helm, forget about the narcotics business! And, that'd end our ambitions to overtake Kancha Cheena. Why cry over spilt milk? I'd warned you. And you had insisted saying that he'd be a faithful dog forever. He wagged his tail, right? Now your bloody dog refuses! We'll kill him at 6 o'clock. Hi there, Vijay! Come in. Welcome. Come inside, dear. Why are you standing outside? Now you want a chair, don't you? Here! have this chair. Oh yes, the chair is for you. We're old men now. We're simply waiting to die. Come on! take over. Over here. Don't they? The phones keep ringing. The telephone is quite a misleading instrument. People like you use the telephone to say things you don't intend to. And you end up doing things quite different from what you say. -You're misinformed. -No. -Come over here. -Who... I? It's you who is trying to mislead me. You're plotting to kill me. When confronted, you offer me the chair. Kill me if you want to. I'll willingly face your bullets. If you kill me, the business is yours and so is the chair. And what if I survive? The guns won't decide who'll win the war, fate will. Why are you shooting at the car? Shoot at me. Go on, shoot! Go on! Let's see some more shooting. Swine! You've stabbed me in the back. Shoot me when I'm facing you. Go on! Swine! Cur! Dog! Look at what they've done to my stuff! You smashed my coconuts! Smashed my coconuts! Curse you! Don't breathe your last yet! I'll save you! I will! Now give me your hand! Your hand! Worry not. I'll save you! I'll take you to a doctor. Now keep breathing! Just keep on breathing. Down the shutters! They dare to shoot at the Don! The Don needs blood! Come along, folks. There was a bandit. Everyone in the city was fed up of him. He used to plunder for the sake of money. Sometimes, he killed people. Your son has been shot by his rivals. He's in a hospital right now. We've imposed a curfew to stop the riots in the city. You can come to hospital in my jeep. Thank you for giving me the news, Mr. Gaitonde. As all evil things meet an evil end, so was it with the evil bandit. One day, he was shot dead. We have enough stock of blood in the hospital. And you may leave now-- What are you raving at? Do you take me for a blood donor? -What else is it? -I took the trouble to bring him here. Do you know how many coconuts I have lost in the bargain? I've lost 325 rupees in all. Are you going to compensate me? -What? -What? It's me. What? Come in, quickly. These fellows are savages! They're screaming and throwing stones. I've taken a few stones too. Bloody savages! I'm Krishnan Iyer MA. And now, I sell coconuts. They nearly upturned my cart! That's when I saw the Don. There was lots of blood. Blood was pouring out of his body. I brought him to the hospital. I did! And now, they throw stones at me! I lost a lot of money in the bargain. I had to throw a lot of coconuts away. The total loss is something like 325 Rupees. These fellows are savages! But what brings you here? -Well, why have you come here? -I'm his mother. His mother! No one plays cricket at night these days? Has a politician won an election? And where are our guards? None of them seem to be around. Could it be that Vijay has survived? I'd warned you not to touch him. If he survives, all four of us are dead. No! That can't be! Let's kill him before he can kill us. A thousand men are keeping vigil out the hospital. How will you kill him? Inspector Pathan will make it possible. For my sake, he will. The Don is out of danger! Hurray! Let us celebrate! Excuse me! I'm Inspector Pathan. I am assigned to protect your son. Will you please ask the people outside to disperse? Vijay is safe now. So the savages have now been sent away! They even made me dance! They gave me this. I don't know whether it's real gold or artificial! -I'll be on my way now. -Son, whatever you did for Vijay and the burdens you bore for him, I don't have enough words to thank you. You'll come back, won't you, Son? I'd stayed back for my 325 rupees. I thought I'd leave after I receive 325 rupees. -And you've given me so much more. -What do you mean? I've been living for many years on the sidewalk. I haven't ever been addressed respectably. I'm used to hearing abusive language. But you've addressed me as a son. I will come. I surely will. I'll come, even if it is the last thing I do before I die. I will come. I surely will. A black cat across my path! Now I have to take 10 steps backwards. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Get out of here, you fool! Else I'll cut your head for you. What did you say? Will you cut my head off? -Oh yes. -Do you know what I could do to you? -Just get out of here. -I'll thrash the daylights out of you! Hey! will you cut my head off? Now, wait and see what I am going to do to you. Hurry! The patient could be dying! He wants my head! Hurry! Hurry! They made fun of me out there. And, I told them, I'd show them up. The Don isn't here at all. He's inside the bathroom. Vijay Chavan survived the second attempt. You don't know my situation right now. Tell him, my life is in danger. Vijay Chavan is leaving the hospital tomorrow. I'm taking the first flight to Mauritius tomorrow. Tell him that. Vijay Chavan has survived the second attempt. After a long while, an Indian fish has appeared in my waters. -Invite him to dinner. -But, Vijay Chavan-- It's my principle to befriend an enemy who gains a fresh lease of life. So as to gain a fresh lease of life for myself. Have flowers sent to Vijay Chavan. KAANCHA CHEENA. Don! Please forgive me! I've committed a grave error! Kancha Cheena has sent me these flowers. Nice flowers. Forgive me, Don! Please forgive me. Why is he weeping? His uniform is a symbol of his power. He can stop anyone he wants to. He can let anyone in. -He can allow anyone to shoot. -I won't make such a mistake again! Tell him not to do such a thing again. Does he want to die? He doesn't want to, does he? Ask him to see reason. And he must do my bidding from now on. Now get going! Take him away! -All right! Go on now. -Thank you, Don. Thanks a lot. Congratulations, Vijay Chavan. On the fresh lease of your life. Now, you're the uncrowned king of this city. Everyone in the city is celebrating your recovery, except your four bosses. I think you'd like to make your moves, after the enemy has exhausted theirs. But I won't let you succeed in any move. I'll stop you in every path you go like a wall. Because, I'm an honest police officer who can't be bought and who still lives off a meager salary of Rs.1500. Demand for a hike! You should really hike the salaries of your policemen. The salary isn't enough for a living. Can it pay for the conscience? What's happening here? Now, go on everybody, please leave. We'll come tomorrow. The visiting hours are over, come tomorrow. -Excuse me, please leave. -Mummy! Mummy! Your mother still makes a livelihood out of 500 Rupees a month. You've been lying unconscious for the last three days. And your mother didn't move for a moment all this while. She just sat by you. -And you-- -What's your name? Why do you want to know that? You're the first woman after my mother who has seen me naked. I was a child when I played on her lap. And here I have been lying unconscious for three days. And you took care of me. That's why I ask. -What's your name? -Mary Matthews. And I am Krishnan Iyer, M.A. I sell coconuts. I've been coming here for last three days. Your men asked me not to leave. Oh, I know that they call you a ''Don''. They told me Don will reward you. I told them I don't want a reward. And I'll leave as soon as you reimburse my loss of 325 Rupees. And will you keep on standing over here? What if I don't give you the 325? No! You can't do something like that. I picked you up and brought you here. Had I been five minutes late, you could've died? Then I would've had to take you to the crematorium. All right. I'll let you have your 325. Now, Krishnan-- -MA. -Oh yes, the MA. -But you must promise me something. -What? That you'll be there beside me should anything like this happen again. Nothing's going to happen by God's grace. I'll come five minutes earlier, if something does happen. And when I get angered, I might do just about anything! Those're the bullets which were taken out. They're useless now. Wait! Give me those leads. Tomorrow he'll be discharged from the hospital. And then, kill us. -Nothing of the sort will happen. -Get out of my way! Hey! Shetty ran out on us! Hey, sit down. -Oh, hello! Where are you going? -To hell! Get out of here. Or will you save us still? Hello, Mr. Terelin! How do you do? -Greetings. -Greetings. How are you, Don Usman? Everything all right? Considering the present circumstances, I've come to a conclusion that there's only one place safe for you, where you will be in no danger. -Where is it, Mr. Pathan? -Where! The lock up in my police station. Usman! Usman! Hello, Don Hasmukh. How are you, Don Usman? I have been faithful to my masters for long. I always return whatever I take from my masters with interest. No! Don't! Please, Don! Please don't kill me! Please forgive me! I'll go back to my village! I swear! Please don't kill me! Take your hand away. Please take your hand away. Step aside. Why? What's up? Both of you seem troubled. The nurse was worried that you-- That I have run away! No, doctor, I don't run away. Do I look like I'm about to run away, I don't, do l? But if you don't discharge me tomorrow I'll surely kill a few people. Your bodyguards weren't letting me in. Just as you don't let me go out of here. Long live, Don Vijay. Long live, Don Vijay. Why are you weeping? Don't weep. I took four bullets. But I didn't drop a tear. Do you know why? Do you know? Because I had all of you with me. You are my power. Nothing has happened to me. Look at me. I'm all right. Nothing is wrong with me. -What's the matter? -My husband's body is lying here. But I can't find anyone to take him to the cemetery. Don't say that, Mother. I'm here. We'll take him to the cemetery. Make all the money you can. But, don't let these children beg on the streets. We mustn't let anyone sleep hungry. Make palatial houses for yourselves. But also shelter the poor. Else, I'll kill you. Understand? I will. I could've given you a lot of money. But I know, that people like you will take only what is due to you. Keep that my friend. It's your 325 rupees. You've taken me for a friend and... your mother has taken me for a son. I'm grateful. tell me whatever you want. I'll do as you say. I have only one sister, Siksha. Hey southerner! Why are you going inside the college? Children are dancing inside. Now get out of here. Did I hear you call me a southerner? Now take a good look at me. And give me a salute and do it again. -Who are you? -I am Krishnan Iyer. M.A. -M.A.? -M.A. The Don has sent me here to guard your body. -Bodyguard? Wow. -Looks like a smooth one. -Siksha, he suits you. -Shut up! Get lost! Come back after you've learnt how to dance at a disco. Dancing in a disco could give you a sprained leg. Shut up! What is it! Are you making fun of me? Let me show you! I'll show you the coconut disco dance. Come on! Hit it! I will show you a southern disco today I will show you a southern disco today When I get agitated I will make you all dance To my tunes in turns. Krishnan Iyer, MA Who is a tender coconut vendor has come I am a tender coconut vendor I will show you a southern disco today When I get agitated I will make you all dance To my tunes in turns Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come. Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come. I will steal your heart today We'll see who kicks us out of this party I will steal your heart today... We'll see who kicks us out of this party Shut up, and get out! Once I enter, I don't leave Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come I will show you a southern disco today If I get agitated I will make you all dance To my tunes in turns Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come I can do whatever I want It's not like I'm afraid of you I can do whatever I want It's not like I'm afraid of you You dance as if you're having fits You dance as if you're having fits You make me noise when you hear me sing Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come I will show you a southern disco today If I get agitated I will make you all dance To my tunes in turns Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come I am a coconut vendor Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come Krishnan Iyer, MA who is a tender coconut vendor has come What's up, Boss? You are up next. Two of your bosses are dead. And... -...two ran away, -But who are you? Your new boss. The name is Vijay, -Vijay Dinanath Chavan. -But for killing you-- For killing this six feet tall man four inch bullet wasn't enough, understand? I understand Boss, I understand. Now understand one more thing, I don't do blind business in the dark. If you want to talk business, come see me in person. Very good, the food is delicious. When your brother looks at this, he'll be very happy. He's so excited, as if not your brother but a God is coming to eat with us. Mother, I haven't seen a God. But if there were modern God's in today's world our brother wouldn’t be any different. Mother you don’t know, the poor of the village worship our brother. -Bullshit! -Mummy please, he's about to arrive. And can you please keep quite for a bit? Brother! Oh, let me look at your face! What is this? Why is there a tear in my sisters eyes? These are tears of happiness, brother. -I sent a man to you, Krishna Iyer-- -M.A.? Brother, the food is ready. I'll go wash the leaves. We'll eat from the leaves, it tastes better. Brother, from where did you find this sample? -Sample? What's sample? -This goof. He's not a goof, he's a gem. He was born in the wrong time. From today onwards, he'll stay with you, for your security. But, what happened to me? Nothing. Mummy made all your favorite dishes, brother. -Mummy always knows what I want. -But did you ever try to figure out, what your mother wants? Tell me what you want? Tell me! I'll get it for you right now! Kapoor! Wash your hands first. Hands, oh yes. I'll wash. What's wrong with washing my hands? I'll wash my hands immediately. Washing is over, here take a look my hands are clean. Spotless. Washed spotlessly clean. Your hands won't come clean so easily, Vijay. Your father's name was tarnished. It was a lie. Will you prove it true now? Look at yourself, Vijay. Your hands are dim and your soul is dim. Are those the principles, your father taught you? Is this the reward for the principles he stood by even in his death? -Is that what he taught you? -Mummy... Mummy... Oh Mummy. What dirt was there in the hands of the truthful schoolmaster who was beaten to death? They tried to rape a poor helpless mother. How was she dim? You don't know, do you? Let me tell you. What tainted us was weakness! And truth can't change that. Principles can't cure the ills of weakness. Neither can God do anything about it. The only cure for weakness is power. Can anyone speak ill of my father now? Can any scoundrel dare to ogle at my sister or my mother? No one will dare to, for fear of getting hacked to pieces. Well said, your father used to say that man used to be an animal. It took animal centuries to become a man. But you took no time at all to turn into an animal. -Enough! -Mummy! Enough! Enough! Dinner is over. I've had so much to eat in my mother's house today. I won't even feel hungry in another four or five months. Brother! Brother! -Let's move. -No! Don't! Please don't go away! -Mother didn't mean what she said-- -No! She said it purposely. She says all that purposely. And tell her that her words, hurt me more than the bullets. -But, Brother-- -Move it! Congratulations, Mummy. You've been successful once again you threw your son out of the house. Congratulations. You? What brings you here? I was passing by. May I have something to eat? Yes. Be seated. I'll fetch something. ''Wash your hands, first.'' ''Your hands can't be cleaned so easily, Vijay!'' I can't eat that food. I can't! You could buy, beg, rob or steal food. But that alone can't sate hunger. No one consumes food to end hunger. It’s the love that comes with it. It was after months that I went to my mother's place. And I love to eat what she cooks. But I couldn't eat. Do you know why I walked out? She says what I do is wrong. Why mustn't I do what I do? Tell me! Why must I not retaliate to a wrong? I was a child when I saw it happen before my eyes... ...saw my father being killed. And he hadn't done anything wrong. I dragged his body all by myself to the crematorium. I cremated two corpses that day. That of an innocent father and his innocent son. My mother's innocent son is dead and gone. Search as she might but she won't get her innocent son back. Never mind. She might not give me what I seek from her. And she might force me off the table. But I won't ever become schoolmaster Dinanath. I won't! Do you know why I'm telling you all this? You don't let me tell you. You cared for me in the hospital so, I guess I got used to it. I lied when I told you that I was passing by. After I left my mother's house, I thought I'd feel comfortable here. That's why I've come here. I'm tired, very tired. Go to sleep now. Let's talk in the morning. There lies that village. Someday, I must give this village back to Mummy. They threw her out of that village. I must give the village back to her. Oh, my son Vijay is here! It's time now, isn't it, my son? Yes, Uncle. The time has come. The time has come. Bastards! You all took the life of the schoolmaster by stoning him. It's my turn now! My turn! I'll throw stones at you now. You brutes! I stand by my principles. I don't let the right hand know the crime done by the left hand. A powerful man loses his strength in an alliance with the weak. That's why I always seek the friendship of the powerful. Vijay Chavan is coming here on a mission of friendship. Are you going to get into an alliance with Vijay Chavan? Not if you can cut him off. Else, he'll cut your throat. Get that? Yes. I understand. What calls for the celebration? A mighty sword has fallen before a mere thorn. What four people and a hundred bullets couldn't do Terelin has done it alone. Has Terelin killed Vijay Chavan? I've always been punctual. But, I'm late today. I apologize for the delay. Someone dumped filth on me. I thought I'd take a wash in the water to get rid of the filth. I'm Vijay Dinanath Chavan. And I'm-- Kancha Cheena, who lives in a glass house. I've met you. I used to clean your car with a piece of cloth when I was a kid. And now, you want to wear my clothes. No, not all. I don't want to wear clothes. Instead, I want to help someone wear clothes that is this lady. Go on inside. Else you'll catch a cold. -Shall we talk business? -Come, let's sit down. Very ambitious, aren't you? I'm insecure. I'm insecure of people who are over-ambitious. Even the most insignificant of men have their ambitions Kancha Cheena. And sometimes, we must slaughter even innocents to achieve our goals. Have you not trampled upon the weak and innocent? -You have, haven't you? Yes! -What do you want from me? Mandwa. What's in Mandwa for you? That which I can find in any place Any place where the laws are lax. You run a business out of Mandwa. I want to set up base there. We can work together. It'll be like an alliance. Else... Many innocents will die as we compete with each other. Isn't that so? All right. But, be warned Vijay Chavan. Don't try to cross my path. Get that? There's only one punishment for every error, death. Only death! Take a look over there. It's a small gift for you to mark the beginning of our friendship. He was your enemy, Terelin. What's that mark on your hand? I burnt a petrol pump when I was a kid. Also burnt my hand while doing so. The petrol pump was mine. I'll send you the bill. Do send your tailor's address along too. I like the way you dress. Ali Baba! Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Ali Baba! Swing, dance and sing Swing, dance and sing, friends! Ali Baba... Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Listen to a poet O' people of the world Everybody who shakes hands with you Is not a friend Who is there in your heart Who is there in your heart and whom are you looking at? You know it And I am also aware of it I don't want to tell anyone else Ali Baba... Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Ali Baba... These secrets are not meant to be shared with everyone. Everybody who shakes hands Is not a friend This is such a drink This is such a drink That lit fire but does not quench thirst This is the effect of love Ali Baba... Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Ali Baba... All the drinks Are not meant for drinking Everybody who shakes hands with you Is not a friend I won't allow you I won't allow you to go far away I won't allow you I won't allow you to go far away I will keep you bound with me Just with the help Of the strength of my hair Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Ali Baba... All the friends Do not show love and loyalty Everybody who shakes hands with you Is not a friend Swing, dance and sing Swing, dance and sing With merry friends Ali Baba... Ali Baba, Ali Baba has met all the 40 thieves Out! Get out of my way! Step aside! Anna! Vijay Chavan has gone abroad. And his sister is here all alone. I'll be back in sometime, Mummy. Don't worry. She needn't worry. Krishnan Iyer MA will accompany you. -What? Are you coming with me? -Yes. The guard follows your body. I don't need a bodyguard. And, you needn't come with me. Sorry, lady. Don has ordered this. I can't let you go out alone. What? Did you call me a ''backward fool''! You called me a fool! Do I look like a fool! And you're just out of school! And you compare yourself with Krishnan Iyer, an M.A.! I'm an MA! A Master of Arts degree-holder from Kerala University. Are you ridiculing the way I dress? India's first president used to dress like this. Nobel Prize winner Dr. C. V. Raman used to anoint his forehead traditionally. And President Venkataraman was also from the South. Wearing a pant-suit doesn't make anyone a progressive individual. And I'm not ashamed to wear a traditional dress. Do you take me for a fool, because I sell coconuts for a living? Do you take me for a fool? Do you think I'm lying? Wait! I'll show you my degree. You wait! She calls me a fool! Get away! Everyone! Else we'll shoot you down. Oh my! Siksha! You're the goose and that's your sauce. I'd got your brother out of jail. That swine! I'd given him food to eat. The dog! A dog would've been faithful. But, he tried to bite me. The cur! My brother isn't a dog. He's a lion! And you've made a big mistake by tying to bait the lion. I didn't. It was he who challenged me. Your brother loves you very much, doesn't he? He'll surely come here to save you. But, you won't survive. Do you know why? Because I'll cut your fair skin into little pieces. Listen to me. I haven't come here to enjoy myself. Nor have I come here to give you lectures on justice. I have come to this city in search of a livelihood. I come from a village known well for ruthlessness. If anyone comes near me, I'll tear him apart. This fellow is teasing a girl and all you can do is watch and laugh! You're an insult to us! To our culture and our tradition. I've used my hands to cut coconuts. Today, I'll cut up an eunuch! You! Hold it! You have called me an eunuch! You dare insult me! You're the bodyguard, aren't you? Let's see who your bodyguard is. You're one of Shetty's men! Tell us where has he taken our sister? Which roads lead us to them? Which roads! I've administered an injection. Your mom will regain consciousness soon. Shetty is holding her somewhere within a full square mile of slums. We must fight our way through a crowd of a 1000 or 2000 people. That's what these fellows have told us. Police Commissioner Gaitonde has gone over to get her out. But, Shetty's men aren't letting them in. Go outside. Get out of here! He has kidnapped Vijay Chavan's sister. Kidnapped my sister. Brother! -Krishnan, take Siksha away from here. -No. -I won't leave you here. -Get out of here, I said! Look at me now and think back. This boy is much too spirited. If he wipes us out once he grows up, what will we do then? What will we do then? Stop! Stop it now, Don. -The police is coming in. -Tell me! Tell me you scoundrel! Will anyone dare to touch my sister again! Will anyone dare! I'll hack them to pieces! Pathan? What are you doing in here? I got news that the slums are on fire. That's why I'm here. The slums didn't catch fire. They were torched. And you did it. You did it to destroy the evidence! -Don't you recognize me? -Krishnan? This is the reward for a bodyguard. Everything else is all right. Not to worry. It's done my body and her mind a lot of good. -Whose mind? -The disco-freak's. Do you see that? I've turned the forward backwards. And I've made an Indian out of a foreigner. How does she look? My hero! What do you blabber? My love! I am scared. My beloved Your brother will beat me. I salute you My hero, my love and my beloved, I salute you So many names for Krishnan Iyer MA? -Why did you save me? -I just did my duty. -You would've done anything for it -Yes. -Say, you will do it. -OK, OK. -You would have also died? -Yes. Who had a clue That we are made for each other? Who had a clue That we are made for each other? I knew it It's he not she! I knew it, I knew it I was aware that we are made for each other. This heart of mine Was like a closed envelope There was a letter in this envelope It was a love letter I read it today I read it today It said that, ''We are made for each other'' But what should I do? I am a very poor man But what should I do? I am a very poor man That is the reason why I am so close to you That is the reason why I am so close to you Don't fear anyone! Don't fear anyone and love openly We are made for each other Who had a clue That we are made for each other Who had a clue That we are made for each other Who had a clue That we are made for each other Who had a clue That we are made for each other What are you up to? What have you been doing? Have I done anything wrong? Have I not raised you decently? Have I not educated you properly? Go on tell me. Have I not educated you properly? And I see you walking shamelessly holding his hands. Brother she's not at fault. Say whatever you have to say it to me-- -No! -She's not at fault. You dare not interfere in this! This is a family matter. And you are not to interfere! Why! Why did I sent you to a good school? So you could learn the difference between what's good and what's bad. -And what's right and what's wrong! -Do you know the difference, Vijay? You don't know what Siksha is doing-- I support Siksha's decision. -What! They were holding hands-- -Thank God. There is a person like Krishnan in this world who is willing to marry Siksha despite everything. Else, she would have remained tainted all her life for your misdeeds. What are you saying! No, you mustn't say such a thing-- And why mustn't I? Krishna is the good son, I had always dreamt of. What is she saying? What are you saying! I can never be a son to you as he is. He's your own son. Please don't mind her. She's just a bit angry. You're her son. I'm only causing issues for this family I should leave. No. No, you won't go anywhere. You can't go, because you're the good son. It is I, who is the rotten apple. I should leave. Stop him! Please stop him! From now on, I have no one in this world. No one! I have cut-off with my family! You, you are the only one. Will you marry me? Well? Will you marry me? Mom! -Eat this, Mom. Open your mouth! -Why? -Now ask why. -Why? Vijay brother is getting married. That's right! The girl who screamed at me in the hospital. Don't you remember? She's the girl who used to change his clothes in the hospital. She isn't from your community. But you mustn't be angry for that. What is there in religion, anyway? Mom, I swear upon you that someday I'll bring him and his wife to this house. You must welcome them and give them your blessings. What Mom, Mom? Now, please don't cry. I'm no less than a son to you, Mom. I will never make false promises. I'll bring your son home. And I promise to bring them home. Now, please don't cry, Mom. I've treated you with a sweet. Now it's your turn to treat me. A fly always find its way to honey. That one fly calls out to other flies, unless killed on time. Or else they pollute the environment. Understand? I want to hear Commissioner Gaitonde's cries of pain. Go to India. Take help from Vijay Chavan if necessary. May I ask you why are you here? You should wait. Wait here with us. Wait here. This husband of yours he is a man of principles. He worships the law. What has he received in his life? He has confiscated contraband worth millions. And what did the government give him? Nothing. Did they? You don't even have Rs. 200 to paint the wall? Do you? Bring him around. tell him to not be too optimistic about principles and laws. This is a city only by name. But the laws of jungle prevails here. The housefly eats microbes. The frog eats the housefly. The snake swallows the frog. The mongoose kills the snake. The fox sucks the blood of the mongoose. And, the lion eats the fox. While here, the powerful lives on the blood of the weak. -Are you done? -No. I have lots more to say. Understand? But I don't have time. I don't have any time to spare. And neither do you. Get that? You don't have time! But you don't seem to understand! Understood. I understand... ...that you have come here to repay a favor. I remember informing you one day that your people are plotting to kill you. And now you've come to tell me that someone is going to kill me. Yes. Yes, now he understands. Do you know what this is? A bit of vermilion. My wife uses it to mark her marital status. And she prays that I live long. And it is her who has given this to me. It take this to work everyday, carry it with me. Because upon my death, she won't need to use it. Take a good look at their faces. They are not afraid of happenstance. They are proud. Go and tell those people. tell them that Commissioner Gaitonde is ready to face death. The schoolmaster. Just like the schoolmaster. You talk just like Dinanath. Like the schoolmaster Dinanath. Who is he, Daddy? -Vijay Chavan. -Isn't he a hoodlum? We can't sit down to eat with such a person. Hey! Where do you think you're going? Sit down. Sit! Where do you think you're going? Do you find it bloody uncomfortable to sit because I came? Have I lighted a fire under your ass? Don't I look human, no? Am I not human? Am I a bloody animal? Or, am I not dressed properly? Did you buy me these clothes? I worked hard to buy this. Understand? What are the rest of you staring at? What are you staring at? And why are you so bloody silent? My presence has silenced you bloody fools. I've come here to spend my money of hard work, understand? I've even polished shoes. Have you ever polished shoes, no! And, have you washed cars for a living? And you try to show me up! Where do they think you're going? No! What are they trying to tell me! That they're right and I'm wrong! These people from the elite class are gentlemen! And I am a bloody hoodlum! -Excuse me, Sir. -Am I the hood! Are you showing off with your English? What's with the English? You want money for those glasses, right? Well, here you are! How much money do you want? Take it! Take as much as you want! Talks about bloody damage with me! Take your cut from this! Don, we even has a mosque in our town now. A hoodlum? Am I a hoodlum? I went to tell him that his life is in danger. And he tells his son that I am a hoodlum. A hood! May Allah grant you a long life, Don-- I'll show him. I'll show that bloody fool what a hoodlum is. You all stay here. The informer just wants to meet me. No! Please don't hurt him. So, you've been raiding Kancha Cheena's hideouts! Blood looks nice on your uniform. Kancha Cheena wants to hear you scream in pain over the phone. Commissioner! You've already passed out! You white-colored people always resort to trickery. And you will always attack the weak. You tricked the police officer to come here. Years ago, you lured an innocent widow into your petrol pump. You had deceived her. You tried to rape her. And why are you silent! Speak up! Go on. Speak up, you bloody swine! Look at this. A 12-year old ruined your face. But, you're incorrigible. The three-feet tall Vijay has grown up to be a six-and-a-half feet tall man. But you have not changed your ways. You? Are you the same kid? This contains vermilion. But you aren't aware of its power. It’s the crown of Indian women. A crown. Let me show you its power. Kancha Cheena is on the line for you, Don. Hey Kancha, you wanted to hear the commissioner cry of pains? Listen to this! Did you hear that? That was a lot of noise Kancha. Now, wait for the explosion. That was indeed an explosion, Vijay Chavan. He raised his hand on kids! Bloody hood! I've taken you for a brother. And I respect you as an elder. You called me a friend. Is the friendship over? I'm not related to you. But your mother and sisters are your own. It has been three months since you have spoken to them. Your mother is sad, your sister is sad. And, I have been sad too. I can take care of your mother and your sister. But, I won't spare you if anything happens to your wife. Your wife is expecting. She says she does not want a kid. If something happens to that kid. I'll kill them all. Did you go see my family? -Tell me! Did you meet them? -Yes. Whole world knows that you're expecting except me! I know nothing! What have you told Krishnan? What have you told him? You want to abort the child... you want to kill the child. If anything happens to my child, I'll-- You'll kill me, won't you? Go ahead and kill me! Go ahead! You'll be doing me a favor. At least-- At least, I won't be tainted as a mother who killed her child! I don't want our child to grow up and call you a hoodlum. What will you do then? will you strangle the child or yourself? Look at yourself. What have you become! You took me to that town when commissioners' son called you a goon. You wanted to show me that you are not a goon but a god. You are no god, Vijay. That child was a god who promised to give that village back to his mother. Where is the village? Where is it? I want the village, Vijay. But, if you do anything to my child... ...I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Don, if you don't get the stuff in Bombay Just let me know, I'll grow it here for you. Everyone in this village is now an addict. May the Lord strike you down! I used to be the only alcoholic in this village. -And you've had everyone addicted-- -Get out of here! Are you going to hit me? Swine! -That's my humble abode-- -Liar! Dog! Never was born a man poorer than you! -I'll give you a penny. -Curse your mother! Daddy! There used to be a school over here. Children used to study here. Education is really of no use, right? Nowadays, I put them straight to work. And that's what the cur makes the children to do. -That's why no child was born to you! -Get lost! You'll remain a eunuch forever! Don, this is the area of pleasure. The red light area of the village. There used to be just one prostitute in the village. Now, I've brought all the women of the village to whorehouse. Bloody whore monger! It's not a lot of work. They in fact get paid to please the men. Your wife will also be a whore! -Shut up, you bloody bastard! -Swine! Don, why did you stop here? You're looking at this house. Had I not burnt the house you are seeing 12 years ago, it would have burnt me. A schoolmaster used to live here. Master Dinanath. Bloody fool used to dream of making this place heaven. Kancha Cheena and I strategized to defame that saint. The fool tried to reform a whore. That's where we got him. I think about his wife and kids at times when I have too much to drink. The fools must be begging for a living somewhere, I guess. A strong wind is rising, Dhinkar Rao. You might get blown away. Take care. Dinkar Rao, say your last words, or arrange for 5 million for your bail. Five million? My Son! What are you looking at? Come, let me show you the world. Look at there, good. Congratulations Don. We've captured Dhinkar Rao and demanded 5 million. Gora hasn't returned from India. Dinkar Rao isn't contacting me either. And, God knows where Laila is. Laila! Namaste. Oh son! Look at this. Kancha Cheena is coming to India. You have saved my life, Don! I shall never forget this in my life. Are you licking the dust? Stop groveling and get up. Here's the money. Take it. I could give my life for you, Don. You beg for your life, and then offer to give it up for me. You can't give me anything. You have nothing! What do you have? Oh yes, I have. I have property papers of the village. Are those lands yours! Does the land belong to you! It's the property of the villagers! But I have it in lien of mortgages. You may keep the papers. They wouldn't know that I've mortgaged their lands to you. They trust me and I've put my faith in you. I'll return you the money in a short time. I'll sign on a blank paper if you want. On a blank paper. -Go on. -There you go Don, done. This money will save my life, Don. I'll just go give it to Inspector Pathan. I'm very grateful to you, Don. Gone! There goes the bloody bastard! Swine! He bought his coffin for 5 million! Now my son Vijay will write on this blank paper. That you swine sold the villagers' lands to him! Then this swine will watch when I'll kick all those villagers out! And then the villagers will kick your ass out! Isn't that what's going to happen, Vijay? Here Uncle, you may throw the stones now. You'll see how Kancha's glass house will shatter. Pimp! You sold the villagers' lands. Did you bloody own the lands! Beat the bloody bastard! Beat him! You won't even find shelter in the whorehouse! Now she'll sleep with you! You bastard! Run, you bloody swine! Run! So you did get blown away. I warned you. The wind is strong, you might get blown away. Now, you have been tripped. Why did you deceive me? In your drunken fantasies, you used to think about the begging family of the schoolmaster. -You were wrong. -Vijay, who are you? Vijay Dinanath Chavan. That is my full name. That bloody swine is dead! Bloody bastard is dead! Let's trash this place! That bloody swine is dead! Bloody bastard is dead! What have you done! In a fight between the snake and the mongoose, the snake always die. well the snake is dead. It's time for the mongoose to die. He betrayed the snake-charmer through friendship. You must befriend your enemies for profit. Isn't that your business' principle, you said so right? You've learnt my business' principle quite well but you have no inkling of the outcome. It you who'll face the outcome! You! You came to this village 25 years ago, to spread the wings of your transgression. You ruined this place. You snatched away the light from this place. You ruined the soil, look! And look at him, look! Turned them into addicts and gamblers! Turned the women into whores! Took away the innocence of the children! But made a pretty good living for yourself. They don't have any shelter while you carouse in that glass house! They don't have clothes to wear and you change yours by the day. And now, you speak of consequences! Haven't I seen the outcome. Now I understood. Why did you ask for Mandwa? You wanted to outstrip Dhinkar Rao so you can get to me. You want to be in my shoes, want to carouse in that glass house. But you have made a mistake Vijay Chavan. You've been blinded by your greed for power. You dare stepped onto the soil of this village, this soil from where I began my life from. Say it clearly! Clearly! Not the beginning of your life! The beginning of your transgression by killing an innocent Master Dinanath! Master Dinanath, how do you know? Kancha, you may have an iron fist but you are a poor listener. You don't understand, you forget. What did I tell you on the day we first met? My name is Vijay Dinanath Chavan. That's my full name! You understand! Now you have understood. Just now! I don't let the right hand know the crime done by the left hand. What you don't know is that you are about to join the schoolmaster Dinanath. Kancha, why are you stepping back you're the one with the gun. You cannot redo the past by stepping back. Can you? No. And, I have you trapped like a petty chessman. Checkmate. Now, look behind you. If I wanted to, I would've killed you right away. But, enemies of Vijay Chavan aren't given an easy death. I have waited 25 years to get you. Take him away. Let him rot in prison! Go! The court needs evidence understood? I have all the evidence, Kancha I have every shred of evidence for all your crimes. You too, Laila! My name is not Laila. I am Shanti. You took help from Chandabai's mother to kill the schoolmaster Dinanath. Vijay used Chandabai's daughter to checkmate you. -Chandabai's daughter?! -Yes. That's who Shanti is. Chandabai's daughter. An eye for an eye, no? That's my business' principle, Kancha. You must've forgotten Vijay Chavan! I warned you the first time we met whoever deceives me die! Keep that in mind! Bastards! Now that he holds the cards, you beg for mercy! You should beg for mercy from his mother! Ask for mercy from a woman you widowed! Bloody bastards! Go ask for mercy! Go! Mom! Mom! You must promise to do as I say. -What-- -You must promise me you'll do as I say! -But-- -You must promise me you'll do as I say! All right. I promise to do as you say. Now tell what it is. May you live for 2000 years, Mom! I promised you, I'd bring back Vijay. Vijay is here, Mom. He's here. He brought his wife and his son along. Today is a day of festival. Please don't rebuke Vijay today. He has left his crime business, Mom. He has nothing to do with it anymore. This is not only my village's soil... ...it has my father's blood in it. I got the village back. I have cleared my father's name. My work is done. From the blood of innocents... The blood of innocents shall not be spilt on that soil ever again. Look Vijay! all the villagers are here! These scoundrels! Beg for mercy! Beg for mercy! Fall at her feet you scoundrels! -What's all this-- -Beg for mercy! -Look, Vijay! They're falling at her feet. -How did you all get here? Give your blessings to Ganesha. This kid belongs to our family. You mustn't make your mother cry for you. You mustn't make your aunt sad. Nor me. If you'll make me cry I'll- no, not you I'll bash your father. He's the kid in our family. Brother! -You may forgive them now! -Who threw them out of the village? Vijay did. He kicked them all out! And now they are groveling. He promised to give you the village back. He bought the village for you. Vijay got it for you. Let's go back to the village, Mummy. Yes. We'll all go. We'll all go. Shanti, alias Laila to appear before this court! Lord Ganesha! Bless us! May good times!

Say that again! What did you say! Do you know who you're talking to? You're talking to Vijay Chavan. I'll kill you if anything happens to him. Do you know who he is! He's more than my brother. He's more than a friend to me. So much more. -He's my sister's fiancé-- -Don! Do something, Doctor. Please do something. What do you want? Want my blood? Want money? I'll give you whatever you want. But, if he dies, I'll die too. He isn't a goon. He is my mother's favorite son. And he's an innocent person. Please do something, Doctor. I beg of you. Vijay Chavan begs of you. Please! Please do something, Doctor. -Take him to the operation theater. -Krishnan you'll be fine! Flowers for you, Sir. I promise to use all the power at my disposal. I'll use all my power to get them released. No harm will come to them. No harm. What are you saying? Vijay... Don't you know? Kancha Cheena has captured Mandwa. Your mother, sister, wife, son... ...are all his captives. ''The path through fire.'' You helped in my time of need. I won't stand back now. No, Commissioner. You won't interfere. You won't interfere. So, he's the caretaker of the village? Yes, I'm the caretaker. And what are you going to do, kill me? Don't touch me, swine! I'm speaking. Are you going to wipe out the schoolmaster's family? Want to shoot me? That's the dust I shall become someday. So will you! That's what the schoolmaster taught me. His son will settle the scores with you. He's here! Look over there! You bastards! Who's your daddy now! Your aiming at the sky with your legs hanging in the grave. You should start worrying about not being torched to death. Look! He's here! My son Vijay is here! Vijay Chavan I told you that you've learnt my business' principles but, you haven't seen the outcome. Now, take a look at the outcome. Look at this! Members of your family will pay your debts. I will spill their bloods! Be a man and come forward! I promised him I'll be there before time! Why have you stopped, Vijay Chavan? You love to carve a path through fires, don't you? What's stopping you now? Come over and save your family. You've burnt for 25 years. Come and save your mother! Come and save your wife! Come and save your son! Come save your sister! Come on!
