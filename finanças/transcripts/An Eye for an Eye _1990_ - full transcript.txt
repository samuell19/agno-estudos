Tung, Tung I know It's inconvenient for you to speak out. If Yung takes over some of our subordinates. We will lose face. Sure How does this happen? He said we shouldn't touch anything illegal. Or you'll get pissed. That's why he set up his own group. -He's too much. -Yeah. Tsuen Hing Group will be a waste this way. Cheung, do talk with Yung! Yes, Uncle Tung! Is Cheong able to fix it? He can handle it. Don't worry! Alright, we'll leave you alone here. We're off. -Brothers... -What's up? Lots of people here. Get dressed up. -Morning Miss. -Morning.

Uncle Tung did give you money to run business! But you lost them in the gambling table! Ho Sai Cheong! Who do you think you are? Get back and tell Uncle Tung... Don't force me Don't force me...if not. Look who'll suffer if I tell the cop about us! I've got a lot information about Uncle Tung... Fei, please bring me in!

A big trouble really? Be reasonable would you? Why didn't you arrest dad years ago...? Why arrested him till now? I don't want to arrest him! But his man fumed against him, I have no choice. He didn't do anything. Only his subordinates did. I trust you! But it's no use. It all depends on the judge. That means you won't help me! No, but I have no power... I am only a captain. I have no power Fung, Tats really wants to help you but... I want to see dad. I'll arrange it for you! Thank you, Tats! Don't mention it! Uncle Tung. I'll leave now, take your time. Where is Chung? Talking with Yung in the next room, I think! What? Are you kidding? Now you don't want me to accuse the old man? Could you promise that I could be safe outside? If you don't accuse Tung in the court, I can help settling down the affair between you and Tung? Settle? I don't trust those triads today! How could I trust you lousy cops either? What are you doing here? What? Want to hit me? Shut up! Sit down! Chung, let's go! Don't be so proud! I would make you into jail. Sit down. What's matter? You are now disturbing the justice? No need to teach me! I know what to do! Why are you doing so then? If the witness complains, you are in trouble! Are you not going to help Fung! Don't forget you are a policeman... Remember you're a police officer. Chung Sir, Lee Sir Go to work. I care much as you do! She's my girlfriend! Don't cry! I go to talk to you! I can't escape from it this time! I'll admit my accusation to save the party! Tung, don't do that! It's all my fault! Uncle Tung. My brute made you suffer! They can't accuse me of using violent to Yung... Just a few years into jail for running triad! Fung, from now on you handle all my business! Waye, you have help me for years. This time, Please take care of Fung Thank you for what you've done. I will, Uncle Tung! Don't worry! I will take care of Miss! Yes, don't worry, Uncle Tung! Me and Waye will...take care of Miss! Tung is charge of two accusations... Firstly, as the boss of Tsuen Hing Group. Find quilty! Three years in prison! Secondly, find guilty in running triad! Five years in prison! Operate concurrently! Do you have cigarettes Give the way...Give away Ms Wang, what are you going to do? Ms Wang, don't you want to succeed your dad's business? Come in! Anything we could help? Miss Why do our company still run such business? What kind of business? 5 mah-jong clubs, 3 nightclubs and 2 sauna baths! Tung ran these business in the very beginning! We're already a bid enterprise, why still doing these? They're for those subordinates! Close them all! Miss. I'm afraid those old men will dislike that! You are the boss now! You can do what you want! OK! Arrange us a meeting! OK! What is going on? Still doesn't appear! Yes, what time is it now? What a big shot! Still doesn't appear! An impolite girl! Know nothing of respect! Her dad told her to take charge and she takes everything for granted! Did everyone here? Of course we have been waiting for you only. You all know the situation of the company now! Sure, you are now in charge of it for your dad! Just tell us if you're incapable! Yes, just tell us at anytime. We will be very glad to help you. I promised to dad I'll do with all my strength! All your mah-jong clubs, sauna baths, nightclubs...should be closed! What? Closed! Miss! Are you crazy? Uncle Han I respect you and hope you respect Miss too! Or you will be in big trouble! What should we and our men do then? Do the legitimate business! Legitimate business? They are all lazy bones! They'll do their jobs if they are hungry! You all have heard that! What a big mouth! Being bossy in front of us you have no manners. I do this for your good sake! You all see what happened to my dad! -What the heck? -How dare she say so...? Do want us to die in hunger? Absolutely! My mah-jong club earns thousands hundred a day! My brothers need to survive. Tung must have lost his mind in jail... How could such a darn idiot be our boss! We'll be shamed for sure. I think Tsuen Hing Group will be ruined by the darn idiot sooner or later. Tats, you are transferred to the serious crime unit. Why? Sir! Did I not do my job well? I want you to stay personally! But, you know...Your girlfriend is the boss of Tsuen Hing Group now! And you are a captain of the Anti-triad Unit. This will be embarrass for you in working. Why embarrass? If she offense the law, I won't let she go! Enough! Pack your stuff! Report duty to Sir Lau tomorrow! Calm down! Just talk to her, no quarrel again. Fung! Why don't you call me first? We're just passing by. Let's go for lunch! You are running a big business! How could you have time for lunch? What've happened to you? I am too lucky! My girlfriend is the first female triad head in Hong Kong. What did you say? I'm only hand taking charge of my dad's business! Business? Those people are all triads. They'll spoil you sooner or later! Then should I just stand still and let the company fade away! I don't care what reason you have! You always do everything by your own wish! Did you ever treat me as your boyfriend? That is enough! Fung! He just want to help and talk to you! Talk! He scolded me just when we met! Did he ever treat me as his girlfriend? Don't blame on him! He was transferred this morning! So he's not in the mood. Why? Because of you, the female triad head! The headquarter said he'd be embarrass staying in Anti-triad. You are just transferred. You are not fired? You are still captain, getting the same salary. Just a different office! Let's go for meal! I don't go. You've got to eat anyway! You'll have no strength to quarrel if you don't eat! Come on, Fung! I know when Miss became the boss, everybody is having a tough life. Good that you know! We thought that when you're under Miss control, Life has been so good that you forget us all. Don't say that I don't give you benefit. I have a big deal now. Is any of you interested? Big deal? We'll all in trouble if she knows that! You scared of the Miss? Are you? Little chickens. Let's earn some money when Uncle Tung is in prison! We can take the money and run in 97 then! Your idea is good! But can you fix Waye? If all of you stand behind me. I can fix him. Fix him first! -No use just by talking! -Too much talking! I said no. If you don't let me kill one or two. Cheong won't accept me. No way! Then can I just sit and watch? I don't understand. Why won't you let me work under Cheong? You just sit here properly! Hurry. Go away! Nothing to see! Call a funeral vehicle. Speak up! I really don't know! What? Don't know? Then do you know your dad is triad? What is your relation with the dead? I've told you many time. He was an employee of our Kam Hing International Group. Kam Hing International Group! Isn't that Tsuen Hing Group? What a world! A female triad head! Who do you think you are? Loot at me! Don't look around! Having a cop as boyfriend don't necessarily be innocent! If you know this would happen, why done so? Nonsense. Your mouth stinks. Come and have some soup Take it away The lawyer has come. Hurry up! Get going! Go! Go! Officer Chung. I have to finish some procedures. You go first! Okay, bye. Go! What a world! A women triad head! Miss, I think you must be tired today. I'll ask the driver to send you back first! When can we reach the public sea? About an hour! Are they reliable? Don't worry, Cheong! Everything is Ok, you must give me my share! I hope so! Fei, when will you ask Cheong to let me join him? Billy, are you afraid you can't join a good leader when you grow up. Cheong, thank you for saving me. We're good friend. Don't mention it. Billy, bring me a glass water! From now on, my life is yours. Don't say! Don't worry, you'll get well! Cheong, that's the one! How is it, Cheong? 500 long and 500 short. Good!... We want 500 each of these. You get rich this time! Tell your boss that we have everything. No problem! Ask them when can the goods be delivered. My boss ask you when can the goods be delivered. I'll inform you when they're ready. Good. No problem! Wow, Give me that! It's terrific isn't it dad? I rely on this when I'm outside. I heard that the Tsuen Hing Group is smuggling firearms. I know your girlfriend is in charge of that gang. So I want you to investigate this. Don't worry. I'll look into the matter. I don't care what way you use as long as it's solved. Thank you, sir! Lui Sir, they're up there. Look! What are you doing? A sand get into my eye. Give me. Lui Sir, what are you doing? Hey, Sir!

Iced tea with milk. Iced tea with milk please! Have you seen Tats lately? What a coincidence. Come and sit... Please calm down now. Talk it face to face clearly, okay? Don't quarrel. -I didn't say anything. -Mind your own business first. Audrey is really good to you, don't you know? She really cares for you very much. How does that concerns me? Words of concern may not be good to listen. Don't be so mad to each other. Do you want to quarrel with me? No, but you don't contact me. Could you just stay out of the Kam Hing-International Group business? Could you quit as a policeman? What's wrong with my company? Someone in your company is smuggling firearms. I don't believe it! Go and ask Cheong yourself. You are so close to him. What do you mean? Everybody's looking at us now. Can you be more quiet? These are our own personal matters. You can leave if you dislike it. Why do you always stand on his side? We are friends... Friend? You dated her without notifying me. What kind of friend is this? Do you mean that I'm trying to take away your girlfriend? I didn't say that. You said that yourself. You're crazy. Hey, Chung... Sit down, Fung! It is Chung who date me, not you. Good morning, manager. What are you looking for, Miss? Do you smuggle firearms? Miss, after you have finished all the illegal business. The elder members are very unhappy about you. They don't have any income. I smuggle firearms just to help the old members only. Actually I am very good to you. I have another secret to tell you. I love you. Take away your hands. Listen to me, Miss. I love you ever since I first saw you. I love you. I really love you. Believe me! I hate women using red lipstick. Here. What are you doing? I want take some photos so as to keep the good memory. No. Great. Your daughter has come to see you! What happened to you, dad? I am old. I am trapped on the stairs. And hurt my head. Don't you live on the first floor? I don't know why. They move me to the second floor. -Cheong! -Yes, Uncle Tung! Take care of Fung for me. Don't worry. I shall take good care of her. Take a good rest. I warn you. Don't you ever hurt my father again! Hey, we're friends! I'll prosecute you! Ok, call the police! I'm ready for that! Besides, I have already got a good memory. I've got plenty copies. By law you are the owner of the company. You're responsible for all problems. -You fool! -You have no choice! Stop! Freeze! Your dress is poor! Put on a better one next time! Start. Good morning, Miss. Good morning, Miss.

Actually, you two are a perfect pair. I know she is a very kind girl! Cooks me soup everyday but I just do not want that! I'm an orphan! I know my situation! I'm short temper and not aggressive. I have no future. I can't afford having a wife. No, I think the girl having you as boyfriend is very lucky. You are kind and considerate to girl. You are clever too. Clever? I'm not as good as Tats! Miss What are you doing? Miss! You are the head now! You made the justice for me! Cheong killed my dad! I must kill him! I know nothing! Don't talk to me! Miss... Miss...Listen to me, please!

My superior said that you are a very dangerous person! We can arrest you without any warrant. Bring him back! You are making a fool out of me! You better watch out! You trying to scare me? We are make a star and triple-strip. Enough to beat you idiot down! Go! Get lost! Don't look! Today's the most exciting day for me. Right. I shall get suspended for 3 months maximum. I should give him a real lesson. Yeah. You fool, why are you so late? - I think we've met before! -Let me go Kill you Hurry up Don't make noise! You'll wake up all those sleeping! You're the one making noise here. This scum's got good footwork! Go on heck! Go! Shut up! Want me to throw you to the sea? You deserved the death! How are you and Fung? Why don't you tell me that you love her? What's the use of telling you? Would you give her to me? Then why did you let me have her? Who said that? If you are not older than me... and if I'm not that shy, you won't have any chance. What a joke! You are sky! Do we just let that fool took Fung away? Go. Hurry. Jerk, moron, hurry. Why don't you cook soup today? Why do I have to do it for you? You won't eat it anyway! How would you know that I would not eat? You stop cooking soup just because I scolded you? How can you be a good wife behaving like this! I'll have to starve if I marry you! OK, I cook now! A woman has to be scolded to become clever! Big trouble this time! Yes, Chung has changed totally! We have no more soup to eat! Then your mouth will smell more badly with no soup! Yeah? Are you free tonight? Let's go out for dinner! -What do you like to eat? -As you want! Indonesian food?

Audrey! Do something, would you? Call the ambulance! Audrey Call the ambulance! Audrey... Come with me. Chung... None's allowed to come in! Look carefully and clearly! This was what Cheong had done. If you are still human. Help me find the murderer out & put him into prison! I don't know anything really! You don't know? Why do you cover him? Why? No, I want to kill him too! Kill him? If you really want to kill him. You won't let him touch you or kiss you now. Don't treat me like a kid! You won't believe whatever I say now. Stop! How can I believe you! Just for the sake of your father's business. You stay together with that idiot! Tats said you're falling! He's too generous! You are destroying yourself! Get lost! I don't want to see you anymore! How foolish I am to love you secretly for years! He raped me and took a video tape! My father's life is in his hand. I have to obey him! I have no choice? -Hello! Who's calling? -This is Chung! Promise me, no matter what Fung has done. You must forgive her! Forgive her! Hey! Where are you now, Chung? Hey, Chung! Don't be silly! You listen! Choose your girls now! Or you'll have none. I've got this. Get lost! Get lost! You can't escape! Doctor, is he alright now? He now has passed the dangerous period. His backbone & his brain were seriously shocked. His central nervous system was damaged! Unless there is miracle he will become a paralytic. You won't believe a jerk like me. Would express my feeling by writing a letter. Actually I finished this letter long ago! But I have no courage to hand it to you! When I know that you loved Tats, my first reaction was... I would never mail this letter! God, you are unfair to me. When I love a woman truly, and she's belonged to someone else. Finally a girl accepted me but you took away her life. Now I have nothing again. I've bought this which you loved for a long time. Now I give it to you. Wish you and Tats happy together. Hey, look how luxurious my watch is? -Mine is nice. -Yeah. Nice color, this is big. Cheong! A lot of firearms are coming again. We'll be rich. -Thank to you Cheong. -Yes. Cheong, we want to take a rest after this deal. Why?! Well, we have earned a lot already. It's time we should take a rest now. Yes! No one ever thinks that he's earning too much. Cheong, the police are looking tight on us. We want to cease for a moment. It's better to cease for a while You scared? Hey...you can't go in. Cheong, it's seems that you are in charge here. What's it, Uncle Pui? You have been making such a mess outside. Do I mean nothing to you now? I don't mean it. Miss told us to do it. Don't sound her out against me. You think you are her husband? This is for your benefit. Don't say that I only make love to you. I am marrying you now. Miss Wong, are you willing to marry Cheong? From now on, no matter rich or poor, healthy or sick, in good or bad situation, you will respect him, love him, trust him, and walk through the road of life with him? Yes...| do. May God bless this pair of husband and wife. Chung, sorry. I can't do thins you told me to do. Don't worry. I'll fix the matter. I'm going first, Miss. Cheong, Uncle Pui has seen me grow up. Let him go this time. Just for me, okay? Okay, beg me. Okay, I beg you. You really beg me? Yes, I really beg you. Okay, only out of respect for you Thank you.

And confiscated dozens firearms. You see. He betrayed us. He lied that the police has seized all the guns. Yes, unless he give us back all be took. How? He takes half from us everytime. No wonder be has been so good to us. And joined our gang. Darn it! Unless he has a satisfying answer later. Or I'll make him disappear. That's the way. Be careful! Darn it! They told me to meet them at their own place. They think I dare not fight with them. Cheong, don't create troubles, don't go! Because that is their own territory. Take a good rest and have a cup of tea! Who do you think you are? Can you decide everything? Who say I can't win them in their territory? Others cannot do that. But I can! Fei, bring some guys to kill them all. Yes. What so big deal being a head? You are alone. What can you do? You don't even know how to make love. How can you give orders? Use your brain!
