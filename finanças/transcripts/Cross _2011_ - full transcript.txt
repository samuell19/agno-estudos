The world has been at war since its creation. So many lives, lost in vain. Deaths of warriors... Sailors... Soldiers... And the innocent. "You're in the wrong place at the wrong time!" That's where we come in. The gods chose warrior families to protect mankind from the darkest of enemies. They forged amulets from celestial alloys and armed each family. The most powerful amulet is the Cross of the Isles. As time passed, the enemies grew darker. Now, after years of being hidden, the ancient Staff of Sekhmet has been found. When powered by bloodlines from descendants of gods, it will have the power to kill everyone on earth. Your grandfather had this, and his father before him. And now it's mine, and it will one day be yours. And with it, it's calling. What's a calling? Well, it's a responsibility to protect. -To protect who? -Well, those who can't protect themselves. Don't cops do that? Yeah, cops fight criminals, bad guys, the people in the light, and we, we fight everybody else. This cross is your birthright, and with it comes unstoppable power. But only we can use it, because we've been chosen. Why were we chosen? Because God saw something good in us. Ashlashtik, the power from within. Ashlashtik. Lisa Van Dyke reporting live. More bodies have been found, four more in the Los Angeles area today. I'm here with Rachel, who saw the getaway vehicle. They just threw her in the back seat of the car and then drove off. I heard a scream, and then nothing. And then nothing. The city's top cop, Detective Nitti, is on his way to the hospital right now to talk to the survivor and get some answers. Hi, me and my grandpa are here to see my grandma. Excuse me, is this the kid? -What kid? -Uh, the one who saw World War three? No, Samantha's down the hall on the right, but you can't go in there. Excuse me, who are you? Uh, Dr. Sloan is running tests. -Oh! -Oh, hi. So, how is she? Well she's been stirring a bit but she hasn't woken up. Her parents are on their way now. -Ok. -Wait. She needs to get her rest. I'm sorry, Doc. She can rest when she's dead, like me. -Excuse me Sir, please. -I need to finish her bloodwork. I'm a cop, okay? So get the fuck out of here, okay? Now! Doctor, I can't work like this. I'm going to get my own lab. Doctor, this is a hospital, not a police station. He's cursing at me! You'll see! Samantha! Samantha. Samantha, wake up! Wake up. Come on, honey, I need you to wake up. I need you to wake up for me. -Where am I? -Oh, honey, you're in heaven. You're in heaven, and I'm God, ok. Say, "Hi, God!" -Hi? -No, wait a minute. I'm a cop. I'm Detective Nitti. Samantha, is it okay for you to talk to me right now? Do you feel like you can talk to me? I mean, are you okay? -Mm hmm. -I need you to tell me what happened. I was taking photos for my book, and then two guys started bothering me. Hey, hey, hey, that's a nice camera! -That'll bring 30 bucks. -Nice day, ain't it? -Stop it! You're hurting me! -Let me ask you a question. -How much did you pay for this camera? -What are you doing? -Nice camera! -It's nice, ain't it? And then what happened? They hit me in the head, and then I fell to the ground, but I could still see what was going on. I wanna take a picture. I'm gonna get a picture with you. Come here. Smile! (PUNCH) Whoopsie! Hey, I'm gonna get another one. (LAUGHTER) One more! See, the guys in the white truck showed up. -Not these guys again. -At least Callan's not with them. Don't these boy scouts ever rest? Two of them were wearing lots of armor, but one of them was really polite. Gentlemen, I believe you have something that does not belong to you. That's Riot, the older brother. Weapons specialist, army ranger, he's polite, honey, but he's deadly. -Is that right? -Yeah, that's right, unless you're her mother. Backfire. He's the comedian. And explosives expert. Oh yeah, I'm her mother! If you'd be so kind as to give us the young girl, we'll be on our way. -Why don't you come over here and take her? -I was hoping you'd say that! Thor. Riot's brother. Got a very short fuse, and armed from head to toe. Hey, hey, I got this man. There's a little girl down there. Shark. Mild-mannered, assassin. Oh, genius! Brings sticks to a gunfight. -Aah! Oh! Ooof! -Hey, try this out, Stickboy. Nice shooting, Tex. Ow! I hate when you do that. Oh! Good pool game. Who invited these jackasses? I hate party crashers. And then more guys came. If they point their weapons at you, shoot 'em. More guys. Hmm. Were they with the two guys who initially mugged you? -No. -Are you sure? -And you are? -The guy with the gun. Whoa! Didn't see that coming. Good night, goof off. You can't just go around shooting people like that. War, you take the left. Backfire, you get the right. Backfire, will you stop playing with your balls and get serious? And then everyone shot, well, everyone. Let's get this party started! And then some guy came and helped the good guys. -Some... Some guy? -Some guy with guns. -Yeah, with guns. -He had a green glow. Bullets didn't hurt him. -Green glow? -Yeah. Look who's here. Nice of you to show up. -Sorry I'm late. -Yeah, right! -That's Cross. -I thought Cross was just a rumor. Really? No, that's no rumor, young lady. That is a deadly vigilante. Living very dangerously, way above the law. -But, he saved my life. -Regardless, he and his little band of Johnny Do-gooders think they can run around this town, and they can't. -They were all kinda cute. -They were kinda cute? Huh. They were kinda cute. And you know what? When they're behind bars you can come get their autograph from me. Ok? Thank you very much. Hmm. Yeah! What took you so long? -Long? -You called, like, 20 minutes ago. -Listen. I need these people found. -When? Now. I need 'em now. Gunner's coming to LA tonight. Erlik wants the bloodlines mapped and ready. We only need four. Is there time to play? No there's not time to play. It goes down tomorrow night. Now find those people and bring' em to me. Alive! Alive. Fine, fine. Hey. How'd it go? -We're dropping the girl at the hospital now. -Is she all right? She lived. He's not going to get through this. (SIGHS) God forgives all. He's got to forgive himself. Nope. (GUNSHOT) Dude, you got those hot ones yet? Don't rush me, fastball. I told you, they'll be ready tonight. -Easy, Nerdsville. -Stop playing with balls and just use a gun. I told you a thousand times I hate guns. I heard you guys had some fun. -Ah, same as always. -Yeah, almost got killed. Almost got your heads blown up until I showed up and saved the day! Hiding behind the back of my truck. (LAUGHS) Numbers like that? Sixteen people? Come on! I thought you had balls? (BACKFIRE LAUGHS) BACKFIRE: Mr. Big Guns... -Hmm. Nice shot, babe. -Hah. Average. Why don't you put your money where your big mouth is, there, Fastball? Sure! Don't miss. Yeah, right in the pocket, right there. You see? You like that? Here's your stick. -Call me later. -Yeah, lucky shot. -BRUTE: Hey, Lisa! -Nice dog. So the freak with the bloodring staff is coming tonight, and Erlik wants you to pick him up from the docks. Uh uh. Viking? Sounds like a freak. You get him. Hang on. Erlik says one of us. So why does that one have to be me? He's a Viking. He's from the same part of the world. You guys would be like two peas in a pod. Peas in a pod? He wants blood to fill his staff. Rumored to have superhuman speed, to have lived for a thousand years. How is that two peas in a pod? Hey, looks like you've got a fan. Oi. You don't want to do that. Trust me, you will be sorry. Listen, English. I can't drive at night. I've got this cornea problem, shit gets all blurry at night. -Oi, are you deaf? Or are you just looking to get what's coming to you, and I can assure you, it is coming. Do you know who we are? Do you know who we work for? Well, he owns this city. And he owns you. So you, go away. I'm just saying, it would be better off if you get him. Anyways, you owe me for last night, huh? Making me take the bullet, leaving me with that fat chick while you sucked face with the hottie. That's true, true. And now I'm stuck with her. (LAUGHING) Stop writing that ticket or I will kill you. So. It's settled. You go get the Viking at the docks. Fine. I will get him. But you do still owe me. You do. And next week, you can do Erlik's rounds, and you can collect his tolls. Are you kidding? Now you've done it. (FIRES GUN) And if I'm picking that Viking up, you can clean my car. I'll take it to the car wash, but I ain't cleaning it. You know, I've always wanted to do this. And that was for all those innocent victims you ripped off with your little tickets. Ok. You get the Viking with his little staff and I'll clean your car. I'll even throw in one of those pine tree air fresheners. I like that. Cool. How's our bloodline beauty? Still in love with me! (LAUGHS) Detective! So, off the record, do you think this is your buddy, Cross? No. Cross only kills bad guys. This guy may be an asshole, but he's not a bad guy, now, is he, Lisa? (LAUGHS) I don't know, I don't know him. And you never will. -I'm going to take off. -Like you've got anywhere to go. I'm just going to get some fresh air. Just call me if anything comes up. You gonna take Scoob? Hey, don't make me come rescue you, man. I'm serious. Welcome to LA. I'll take you to Erlik. -Hey, Callan. It's been a while. -Hey. How's it going? Doing all right? Yeah? -Long time no see! -Yeah, sorry. -No worries. -How've you been? -Good, thanks. Here, give me one second. -Okay. -How are you doing? -Hey. My name's Elizabeth. It's nice to meet you. Got some new guys in, huh? Yeah, they've been drinking pretty much all day. Should be nice and, how you say, lingered, right now. They've been a pain in the ass all day, actually. -Irish? -Scottish. Scottish? Economy's that bad, huh? If it gets any worse, I'll have to let the English in too. No, please, no. -Thanks, Abbey. It's been fun. -That's our cue. See you soon. Bye! See you! -Is that your real hair color? -Is that your real face, or does your ass have a twin? Oh... That's funny! She's a right clever one! Kiss your mum with that mouth? How about you kiss me with that mouth? How about you kiss my ass, ok? Shit. Oh, you're gonna pay for that. You want a crack at it, tough guy? Not bad. Thanks. You should probably get going before they get up. Let's go. Okay. What about you? I'm fine. I'll go. I was just going to finish my beer. Do you need me to walk you home? I drove. I see. So, you're not interested. -I didn't say that. -Ok. So let's go. I have to get going. David hates when I'm late. All right. Walk you to your car? -That was my car. -That was your car. Ok. Yeah. Looks like you're taking me home! (COUGHS) All right. We are here. Thanks for that, back there. No, it's no problem. Although I'm sure you could have probably handled them yourself, by the looks of it. Can't let guys like that push us girls around. Not everyone's a gentleman like yourself. There are some bad dudes out there. Yeah, you don't know the half of it. Right. -What? -Um, yeah. My keys are in Jackie's car. (LAUGHS) -You are something else. -You don't know the half of it. (CAR STARTING) There should be 52 cards. Where the hell are all the cards? Do I see 52 cards? I don't think so. Who has that card? -Looks like we got ourselves a fox in the henhouse. -And I'll be hunting the fox. Boss, chill out. What are you, Rain Man or something? I'm a savant. I see everything. I've got eyes in the back of my head. Who's got that card? There's a king missing and I want it now. Why do you guys think it's ok to steal from me? Why? Do I have a sign on the back of my head that says, "Feel free to screw the boss"? No, boss. Do I have a sign on my head? No, boss. No sign. You think it's okay to steal from me because I have so much? An accumulator does not let someone cheat him at Fish. An accumulator has principles. Now, show me your cards, everyone. Uh oh. Someone's going to get it. Ara, show me your cards. Here you go, boss. Butcher. -Patch. -No problem, boss. Lucky last. (CAR HONKS) Erlik, not one bloody word he said. He's a freaking mute. He just pranced off the ship and straight into the car. Weird vibe. It's freaking me out, man. I ain't driving this bloke anymore, Erlik. I don't care. One of you guys can get him. He's mental. Proper mental. -Gunnar, welcome to my city. -Erlik. Love that voice. Thanks for sending an Englishman to pick me up. A nice touch. So, who are you, maverick or goose? (LAUGHTER) Say something else. Anything. See what happens. Anything you like. What's the matter? Don't you want to know what happens? I'm stood here. I'll have a conversation. What's the matter? Cat got his tongue? Easy guys, relax. I'm sorry these monkeys can't help themselves. It's talking smack. It's just how they roll. Hey, can I get you something? How about a drink? You want a drink? How about girls? I know you like girls. No, I think this flyboy probably wants to stand here, flapping his jaw and running his mouth. Erlik, if you want to work with me, put this mouthpiece down. -You want me to kill him? -If you want to seal the deal, just do what I ask. I don't suffer fools who cheat when I'm fishing. (GUNSHOT) 86 on the Fox. You cheat me at Fish, you sleep with the fishes. I told you someone was going to get it. I protect my guys. I wouldn't be where I am if I didn't command respect, and look after them. Now, if that's not ok with you then we've got a problem. I've got a solution for that, also. Well that's excellent, because I need loyalty, and you've just passed the test. Now, what about some girls? Lots of girls. And while you're at it, you can get me a boar's head. I'm starving. -You have multinetted markers? -Dr. Zyal's mapping them tonight. Aah, the City of Angels. A bunch of saints and sinners. -What about them girls? -Let's go. Go ahead. Sorry, it's typical of Jackie to leave her phone off. You can make yourself at home. -Any red wine? -Just that cheap stuff. Is that ok? -Of course. -All right. -Nice place. -Thanks. -Where's the ladies' room? -It's down the hall and to the left. -I'll be right back. -All right. Come on. This is yours now, son. Don't ever take it off. Ever. I love you. Dad? Dad? Dad? I guess this isn't going to happen. Is it? Are you ok? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. -All that saving damsels in distress, huh? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, something like that. Hey. Hey. What is this? It's a family heirloom. Do you wear it all the time? Yeah. Yeah, my dad gave it to me. Sentimental? I like that. Tell me about your dad. He was a good guy. He, ah, he was strong. Unselfish. -Was? -Yeah, he died when I was eight. -I'm so sorry. -That's all right. -And... How did your mom handle it? -She had already passed. That's really rough. There's a lot about me that you don't know. Well, there is a lot about me that you don't know. -Why me? -Because you're different. And that... You don't just care about yourself. (PHONE RINGS) -Yeah? -The snatched another girl. -When? -A couple of minutes ago. I just heard it on the scanner. They said that they don't know where she is. The guys that snatched her are an English guy and a bald guy with a spear tattoo on his head. That's one of Erlik's guys. All right. I'll find out where they are. All right. Do that. We'll be standing by. -Give me 30 minutes. -You got it. I've got to go. I'm sorry. What's wrong? Nothing. Just some business I have to take care of. That's all. -Okay. -You can stay as long as you want to. Okay. Here, wait. Call me if you need anymore protection. -You sneaky little... -It's something else. -Unbelievable. I'll call you. -Promise? -Yeah. Yeah, I promise. -You'd better. Maybe next time you can buy better wine. All right. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Woo! Yeah, cash! Bam! That's what I'm talking about. Sometimes you win, sometimes you win bigger! Good luck. A girl is missing. There are a lot of girls missing. What makes her so special? Erlik's got her. I don't have a lot of time. No, you don't. So why are you talking to me? All right. Miller warehouse. You're going to find a lot more than your girl there. A lot more. Bring some friends. And a lot of guns. Callan's here. -Where's the action? -Old Miller warehouse. Right on Fifth. I know where that is. It's been abandoned for quite some time. If we go in there without any intel, we're going in blind. Well, let's go get the girl, then. Eyes in the Sky reporting for duty. Locked and loaded. These are hot. Very hot. Be careful. -Any special instructions? -Just the usual, twist and toss, and then... And then? -Boom. -Boom. -Boom! -Boom! -Boom! -Heh heh... Boom! All right! Look out, bad guys. Fastball's in town. -Let's go. -We'll be here. -Let's go. -This won't take long. Godspeed. I have a bad feeling about this. Ok, bad feeling's gone. Six is good. -Ladies first. -Thanks. -We'll take a look in this room. -Keep it down. "Keep it down." Excuse me, can you hand me some toilet paper? -All right, but I'm going to need this back. -No problem. Thank you. All right. Here you go. What's this? Oh, that's, I thought maybe, you'd give it to one of your kids. -Don't forget to flush. -What? Hey! I need my paper back! Hey! He can't wait, I swear. He cannot wait. I'm going to kick his ass. You all right? -Thanks. -You owe me one. Looking for someone? Say goodnight. Not today, tombstone. Not on my watch. Guys! -Is she all right? -We've got her. Let's get her out of here. She's alive. She's passed out, but she's alive. -Grab her, let's go. -Yeah. Hello, Callan. Hey, Callan. Boo. Where's Callan? I don't know. He was right behind me. But I sure as hell ain't going to try to squeeze into this coffin-on-wheels until he gets here. Ok, here he comes. Come on, Cal, let's get out of here. Oh, it's about time. I was starting to think you were going to try and rescue another dog or something. (SIRENS) Oh! Cops! -Coming in. -Oh my God. Is she alive? -Let's get her on the couch. -What did they do to her? -Got her? -Yeah, I've got her. Cal? -Is she coming around? -She's out cold. How's it going, Cal? Are you all right? -It's gone. -What's gone? -My cross. My cross is gone. -What the hell do you mean, your cross is gone? -I didn't think you ever took it off. -I don't ever take it off. -He took it. -Yeah, but who? I don't know his name. He was strong, I dunno, he was really strong, and he took it. He ripped it right off of me. -Who would do such a thing? -Is the fairy princess awake yet? -Hey, are you all right? -Yeah, I'm all right. All right. All right. Let's deal with this. What do you want us to do? (CALLAN SIGHS) Ok, good. Easy. Take it slow. Get it back. -Where am I? Who are you? -You're safe. How did I get here? Well, what happened? Well, the bad guys almost had you for a minute, but now you're safe with the good-looking and talented good guys. I was walking home and they just, just grabbed me. -What's your name? -Millie. Millie. Do you have any idea what they wanted with you? They wanted my blood. What do they want your blood for? I don't know, but it wasn't a match. What wasn't a match? -I don't know. They need it for a staff or something. -A staff? Yeah. Sackmet or Seckmet or something. -Wait a second. They said Sekhmet? -Yeah, Sekhmet, that's it. -Like, "Sekhmet!" -Yeah, that's the one. -What's wrong with you, man? -What are you talking about? I don't know, it's just supposed to be a legend. It's not even supposed to exist. -What is it? -Something pretty gnarly. -A staff. It's a staff? -Well, it's an ancient Egyptian story. This Sekhmet was a goddess. She was a daughter of Ra, who is the Egyptian sun god. Remember that movie with Dr. Jones? The whole map-room thing with the stick and... -Yeah. -The red jewel and the light went through. Ok. Well, these dudes rebelled against him and Sekhmet got really pissed, so she went crazy ahd she slew them all and she drank all their blood. -Sounds like my ex-wife. -I said slew them all. So, anyhow, she created this staff that was powered by the souls of the dead. She was going to go on a killing spree and kill everyone, so the gods intervened, and they fooled her with beer and pomegranate juice. She thought it was a river of blood and she drank it all, and she passed out, and when she woke up, the staff was gone. -What happened with it? -No one knows. How would Erlik get a staff like that? That guy never leaves LA. No, no, this has nothing to do with him. Somebody's pulling his strings. The thing is, the legend says that whoever finds the staff can put it back in action. -What kind of action? -The killing kind. So is there anything that we can do about it? Can you stop it? I don't know. I can look into it. Do some research. All I really know is, it's basically... Satan in a stick. JULIANE: Great. That's fantastic. Hey, Shannon. Care to donate some blood today? Can I get a ride? (TUNELESS HUMMING) Ah! Okay, darling. Well, well, well. Let's see what we have here. It's blood, it's just blood! I swear! Let me go, please. I won't tell anyone, I promise! Well, that's true. You won't tell anyone. -No! -I can assure you of that! But first, I just need a little sample. Don't flinch. -It makes it hurt more. Shh. -No, please. Shh! Shh! Oh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Thank you! Let us go, we're not gods! Okay... You've got the wrong girl, my blood has nothing to do with some stupid staff! Oh, that's odd. Hm! This is odd. Oh my. Hm. Well, you come from the proper bloodline, but your markers are all off! -Markers? What are you talking about! -Yes, your markers... You know, I think what we need to do is... We need to have a look inside. Your blood will power this staff and I'll be rich. WOMAN: Please, just let me go. Okay, let's see here, uh... Eeny, meeny, miny...yeah. Ha. Yeah. No. Stay away from me. Just stay away from me. Leave her alone! What's wrong with you? I'll tend to you in a minute. We're just beginning to have fun. Be patient. Now don't move, don't move! It hurts more if you move. Yeah! Whoa! Mm. She's a little tastier. (TUNELESS VOCALIZING) Now. I do not understand. The genetic markers... They're not... They're not correct! I mean, you're all descended from the gods, and these, these... You know, there's something about this blood... It's not the blood... It's the bloodline that... Yes, that's it! Ah yes, ah yes. Okay. We need these two now. That's the final two. Are you sure? We've brought you 11 people already, and only two have been a match. Don't question me, Brute! -I'm... -If you're wrong, Gunnar's gonna kill us all. I think that I'm right and I'll prove it! You'll give me a reward, and I'll throw you both a bone! Mm. Can I have them when you're done with them? Don't test me, Wire. I need them both unharmed, at least for now. So do not mess this up. Now, you two skidaddle. Oh! The blonde! -No! -Oh yes, it's okay. It's gonna be good! The thing was designed to kill thousands, right? Why now? Why would someone want to kill that many people? Well, gimme an hour. I'll contact a few labs. Have them check the common genetic markers between Milly and the other victim and see if there's something there. All right. It's a start, I guess. I'll be back in a few. -Nuke, you want to take Milly home? -Done. Hey, Cal. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be back. -Cal! -What? I know she was the love of your life. But she was my best friend. I've forgiven you, when are you going to forgive yourself? I'm not. I'm not gonna forgive myself, why should I? I let her die. -She was my everything. -Don't you think I know that? Okay, she knew that. You can't save everyone. No one can. You know what? You weren't there. Were you? You weren't the one holding her when she died. (CHOKING SOUNDS) I'm so sorry. You can't blame yourself. We're a team. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore, I'm not enough. You're everything to us, Callan. Your power? It's your responsibility. Really? Zoey was my responsibility, and I couldn't take care of her, could I? I'm done. I'm done. This is my last mission. (CELL PHONE RINGING) -Hello? -Hey. Where are you? I'm home. Where are you? I'll be there in 10 minutes. -Great. I'm starving. Let's get something to eat. -Nah, some shit's going down. -What? -There's a guy that may be looking for you. -You need to get outta there. -I'll get my things. VOICE ON TELEVISION: Rita, let's take a look at the map. Temperatures today up in and around 65 - 70s... (QUIET SPEAKING) Police scanners are going crazy. It's a rough night out there, man. I haven't seen the scanners light up like this since Erlik's big stunt in Chinatown. Okay, okay. Would you stop pacing? All right? Just relax, man. You're starting to make me nervous. He gave. And he taketh away. Well, dude, bite your nails or something, man. Come on. Lisa Van Dyke, reporting to you live. Three more victims were kidnapped and there were no witnesses. Only a trail of blood was found, and once again, the police are left empty-handed. You know, it's gonna get worse. Well. Sure hope not. This is some late night sci-fi boogieman horse trash TV, man. Jesus. On top of this, some freak's got Callan's cross... It's a story you're gonna want to hear. Stay with us. Hey everybody, this is Sunshine. Sunshine, this is everybody. (ALL CLEAR THROATS) -I'm Lucia. -Nice to meet you. Yeah. Hey, um. Shark. Nice to meet you, Shark. Yeah, Callan told me all about you guys. Got yourself a real pistol there, man. At least I know how to use one, Ball Boy. Did you find anything? Uh... Yeah, I did. I did find a common genetic marker between the two of them, and in fact there is another two in the greater Los Angeles area. Who and where? Uh. One's a girl named April, and the other's a girl named Selene. April's a cocktail waitress at a bar on Second and Main and Selene is just a name and address. All right, so let's split it up. You find Selene and I'll find April. Take Sunshine with me. -Whoa-whoa-whoa, you're taking a civilian? -Yes we are. What, you think I'm gonna let you guys have all the fun? LUCIA: Are you serious with this? CROSS: Suit up guys, come on. BACKFIRE: Oh. -Keep your eyes open. -Mmm-hmm. Let's go. War, Backfire. Hang by the tree and watch your six. -Which one is it? -It's number 12. Think she's up there? I hope so. Man, I hate this shit. I don't like it either. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Selene? Selene? She left in a hurry. She didn't leave. She was taken. What the hell's taking them so long? Hope Callan's doing better than we are. Yeah, I'm sure he is. What can I get you? -A water. -Water? On the rocks? Yeah. On the rocks. There's always time for a quick game of pool. Not so quick. I like a little staying power. I always stay till the job is done. Oh God. Okay, watch out. Nice shot. Huh. Solved it is. -First one's on me. -Thanks. April! I got two beers in the corner table, they've been waiting all night. Okay, okay. Ease your horses! They wait. They always do. -They're not gonna wait all night. -Got it. -Excuse me, may I have another? -Sure, I'll be right back. -Here you go. -Thank you. It's slow tonight, right? Yeah, but the tips are great. Don't miss it. -He rails, and... -Yeah, story of my life. -Coming right up. -Thanks. April. Maybe. -Should I make that a double, or are you driving? -No, no. Um... Listen, I don't want to frighten you. If you don't want to frighten me, don't start the conversation with, "I don't want to frighten you." Some people are looking for you. Yeah, I call them drunks! No, that's not what I mean. Well, then what do you mean, exactly? You come from a very unique bloodline. Who are you? Let's just say that I'm a friend. I have a lot of friends, and you need to work on your pick-up lines. Listen to me. Some very special people are looking for you. Special people? Hm. Excuse me, Miss? I spilled my drink, can I get some napkins? Just a second. Back away! ARA: Not so fast. -You're not gonna make it out of here. -Is that a fact? Yeah, it is a fact. (DOOR OPENING) You know what they say, a pool hall is a poor man's country club. Please, put the gun down, or Little Miss Sunshine over there gets eclipsed. -Hey. Bring Gidget here. -No. -Nobody moves. -Nobody moves? So what you think we're gonna do, just stand here and sweat? Okay? Now where's the fun in that? Besides, you don't have your cross on. You can't do that little green magic stuff you usually do. Let's see. Oh, what do we got here? -The usual suspects? -Help yourself. -Ah, here we go. -Ah. Fine scotch malt brand whiskey. How you drink it is more important than the brand you're drinking. Thanks, bro. Although a good malt should never be mixed, it is accepted to add a pinch of bottled mineral water. Just for taste. -Slay! -Yeah. -Nobody leaves. -No one's going anywhere. You two. Over here. Come on Erlik, let's blast these freaks. So quick and easy, pretty boy. Now, they say that mineral water calms its aggressive nature and allows the whiskey to open up. Now, the aroma is released with just a few drops of water added. Look at that. Oh my God. Oh yes. See, Callan, the way I see it, man is a gaming animal. He's always trying to get better at something or other. The better the gambler, the worse the man. Unfortunately for you, I'm an excellent gambler. Okay, so how do we play this? I don't think you want to know the rules before the game starts. Oh, what the hell, I'll tell you. If I make these three shots, I take the girls, and I kill everybody else in the room. But if I miss one, I let you and your girlfriend go. But regardless, she's coming with me. That's one. Be patient, Longhair. Because one moment of impatience can ruin a whole life. Shark. Smart. You know I read the sports section every morning. The sports section shows a person's accomplishments. The front page shows a person's failures. Two. I'm like a serious sport that has nothing to do with fair play. It's bound by boastfulness, hatred, total disregard for rules, and a sadistic pleasure in violence. You know what I call this shot? I call it the steamroller. You ready? Okay. Let's go. -Come on April, we'll be fine. -What? Put it down. She has faith in you. She's in for a big letdown. Now what. We walk outta here. In 12 hours we drop 'em off unharmed, or we can dance right here, right now. And Callan, if you try one of your superhero rescues, I'm gonna drop these girls... Just like I dropped that eight ball. Well, that was fun. You and me. Soon. -Late dinner? -I'll bring the wine. Red wine. Get her out of here. ERLIK: Let's go fill that staff. Well, that pretty much sucked. Found my bloodlines? The two girls were a match. Dr. Zyal verified it. I got some more good news. Do tell. I got his girlfriend, Sunshine. Good work, Erlik. -Show me 'em. -They're downstairs. Dr. Zyal's prepping them as we speak. Then I'll just need one more. You ever felt pain, Erlik? I'd dealt more than I've felt. Ever lost a loved one? Can't say that I have. I never loved anything like that. I've lived a long time. I've lost hundreds. Well, that's all well and good, but what are you getting at? -It's simple. -Yeah, simple. You got me what I needed and now I don't need your services. Good, then I'll take my money and I'll be on my way. It's not that easy. You don't have my money? Well, things have changed. Look, I did exactly as you asked. And you promised me $1,000,000 and eternal life. Yes. You got me my blood for my staff. And now, I don't need you. Who the hell you think you talking to? Now, see, this is what we call a Mexican standoff. I'm not Mexican. I'm gonna give you to the count of three to get my money. And then what? One. Two. Three. What the hell, man? You fool. I can't die. But you can. Lucky bastard. I don't understand. Why don't you die? I'm cursed. Cursed to live forever. There's only one way I can die. They have the girls, we have to find out where. Could be anywhere. Well, there's one way to find out. What, crystal ball? Yeah, the crystal ball. WOMAN: Yeah! Hey. Where's Erlik? What do I look like, 411? I'm trying to run a business, here. Where is he? Easy. He's shipping. Small building down in Chinatown, you can't miss it. This is charming. Roof clear? Looks good. Marco! I swear to God... LUCIA: Nice. I'll take the guards first, all right? I got the six. Go ahead. Go ahead. Inside. Let's go, brother. Backfire, Shark. Watch the door. Nobody in, nobody out. You got it, Boss. Yeah, we can handle the door. We got this. Right? Wow. Dude, we are in Erlik's lair. First time for everything. Trippy. It's kinda too easy though. CALLAN: Looks like someone beat us here. -WAR: Let's finish the job, you son of a bitch! -RIOT: Stand down, War! Stand down, War! RIOT: We need him alive. -Where is she? -The girls? -Sunshine. -You can't help her now. You have to save all of us. -Where is she? If you don't stop him, he's gonna kill everyone. Who's gonna kill everyone? Gunnar, the guy who did this to me. The one with your cross. Everyone on earth. (SCOFFS) That's impressive. I'd like to see that. He's gonna kill us all. Why? Why is he gonna kill us all? He's cursed to be the last human soul on earth. -He's been through more pain than we can imagine. -Not yet, he hasn't. You don't understand. He wants to die. -And he plans on seeing that through. -We can help him with that. I saw him get shot and he laughed. It's called a bulletproof vest. Novel idea, Erlik. Naw... He wasn't wearing no vest. I saw him get shot three times in the chest and he didn't even flinch. You guys can't hurt him. Where is this going down? The Gibson Towers. The eighth story, one at the top. Why is he helping us? I don't trust him. He played me for a fool. He promised me millions, told me I'd live forever. And then he did this to me. Yeah, hit me while I'm down. Who's the big man now, Callan? She better still be alive. Ugh! I owe you one... One. -CALLAN: Let's go, Riot. -ERLIK: Callan... He said it was a chess move! -It's showtime. -Come on, we gotta move. -What happened? -We let him go. -The hell, what for? What... He's the bad guy. What... Oh, man. (PHONE RINGING) Hey. Got it. We'll be there. Gibson Towers. All right, they're gonna need us. We're gonna need more firepower. Drop me off at the north tower. I'm gonna work the outside end. Let's hurry. Okay fellas, it's time to earn your pay. Whoever survives the battle, I'll pay $100,000 in cash. That's the only reason we're here. And I thought it was because of my good looks. Kill everybody. Lave Callan till last. Make sure he makes it to the top. I'll deal with him personally. How do you know he'll come up? He knows where I'll be waitin'. He knows we got the girl. And the cross. So finally your boyfriend's turned up. And just so you know, when I kill him, I'm gonna put him right there. Pathetic. He doesn't even know what he's in for. (DOOR SLAMMING CLOSED) -Seriously? -LUCIA: Come on. What? Be ready for anything. Let's split up. -Riot, you come with me. -Watch your backs. Wait till they get a load from my balls. Page 47. Read it, repeat it, and keep repeating it. Cause your life depends on it. I can't read this. (HIGH PITCH SOUND) (HIGH PITCH SOUND) (CHANTING IN A DEMONIC VOICE) (CHANTING) -Again. -(CHANTING) (CHANTING) -GUNNAR: Again. -(CHANTING IN A DEMONIC VOICE) (CHANTING) (CHANTING) Shit. Whoa. Dude, you're a big bad guy. (GROWLING) Mm hmm. You got no gun? (GROWLING) Uh-uh. All right, then. Ugh! Oh, man. Ugh! Ugh! Ah! Dude! Agh! (GROANING) My balls! MAN: (GROANING) My balls hurt a little more. BACKFIRE: Hold on to that! (LOUD EXPLOSION) I hear dead guys. I don't know if I'm gonna remember how to do this. I think it'll come back to you. I call shotgun. -SHARK: (WHISPERING) I got the right. -(WHISPERING) I'll clear left. -JULIANE: Thanks. -MAN: Let's play some pool. Eight ball, side pocket. RIOT: Shit. RANGER: Hey. RIOT: Thanks for joining us. Game time. Oh shit. Agh! MAN 1: Look, it's Callan's prize-winning fuck-up. MAN 2: Well, look here, we've got ourselves a loner. MAN 3: What a chump. -MAN 4: (LAUGHING) -Oh shit! MAN: Where you going? (LOUD EXPLOSION) (GUNSHOT) Ugh! Perfect. He'll be here in a minute. -I've waited a long time for this. -For what? For the end of a long road traveled. What are they gonna do to us? I'm not gonna sit around here to wait to find out. -What are you doing? -What does it look like I'm doing? Getting us out of here. -He'll kill us if he sees you doing that. -He will do more than kill us. He's going to kill us anyway. We're not just sitting here for decorations, okay? To the end? To the end. WOMAN: (CHANTING IN A DEMONIC VOICE) WOMAN: (CHANTING IN A DEMONIC VOICE) Ah, my ship just rolled in. WOMAN: (CHANTING) (GASPS) -Come on. -Hurry. -Come on. -What took you so long? -Traffic. Shit! Come on! Son of a bitch! -Take care of that fool. -MAN: It'll be my pleasure. -APRIL: Hurry. -SUNSHINE: Ugh! Come on! -SUNSHINE: Ugh! -APRIL: Hurry! Do yourself a favor. Shoot him in the head. -SUNSHINE: Hurry. -APRIL: Come on. Come on, come on, come on. CALLAN: Oh shit! Riot! Behind you! Ugh! Come on! You killed my friends, I kill yours. -Come on, come on, come on. -Hurry! - Ah! SUNSHINE: Come on, come on, come on. -Ahh! -SUNSHINE: Callan! -CALLAN: Ugh! -You took the bait. -CALLAN: (GROANING) -Your blood is the catalyst that makes it all work. -CALLAN: (GROANING) -GUNNAR: Agh! Pathetic! Poetic, isn't it? Your blood will help me die. (LAUGHS) Blood of the Gods. Powered by the souls of the dead. From hell to the heavens. And the blood of the Gods. Look around, Callan. (LOUD WHIRLING) (CRASHING) I fooled you like I fooled Erlik. And everybody else. (GROANING) (SCREAMING IN PAIN) Look around. You helped me with all these dead souls. (SCREAMING IN PAIN) Ah! I wanted you to see my last victory. (SCREAMING IN PAIN) That's cool, I've never felt that before. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Oh, pain. That's the first time in a thousand years. But I'm not finished yet. Oh, really? Well you oughtta have a look around. Because you're gonna die along with everybody else on earth. Because the staff has already started. (LIGHTNING CRASHES) (LOUD EXPLOSION) Ugh! (SCREAMING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (CHUCKLING) It's over, Callan. You're finished! But best of all... I get to see you die first. How do you like that? CALLAN'S FATHER: It's strong, Callan, it can change the world. All that power in this little thing? Well not quite. Ashlashtik. What does "Ashlashtik"? Well it's the power from within. Ashlashtik. That's right. Let me hear you say it. -Ashlashtik. -That's good. -Again. -Ashlashtik. -Ashlashtik. -Ugh! Ashlashtik! -GUNNAR: (LAUGHING) How'd you like that? GUNNAR: (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) You can't stop it now! Do you know how long I've waited for this? (LAUGHING) GUNNAR: The staff will kill all of you! I can finally die! And you can't stop it. It's done! It's done, you idiot! (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) No! No, I'm supposed to be dead. I'll find another way. No. This is your last day. You forget... I can't die! (LAUGHING) Let's test that theory. (LOUD EXPLOSION) Oh! Couldn't you have done that ten minutes ago? -RIOT: (LAUGHING) -Sorry. I got your back. Callan, what the hell was that? (LAUGHING) Callan, what happened? -It's done. -Where's Backfire? I don't know. He'll show up somewhere. He always does. (WINDOW OPENING) WOMAN: Ah! (GUNSHOT) Oh, hey! There you guys are! Wha... (WHISPERING) There you guys are. I've been lookin' all over for ya. Where the hell have you been? Well, I had a little minor setback, little setback. But I'm okay. Let's go get 'em. Look, I just got shot in the fuckin' head. -Fire escape? -Yeah, couldn't find the elevator. -Where'd you find the elevator? -Let's get outta here. BACKFIRE: Exhausted too. Man, that's a hell of a work out. Let's go get these guys. BACKFIRE: You guys seen that red light that hurt? Hey, we found a lead on your guys. Hey, you know what I don't like? Guys running around town doing my job, your job, you know? Hey Nitti, the guys think you're going a little crazy with this. You know like... Busey in Point Break? You're chasing ghosts. Yeah? These ghosts are responsible for a million dollar damage to the public's dime. And I am the public. Yeah, but these guys are responsible for taking out like half the bad guys in LA. You know, if they exist. They exist. Okay? And I am gonna be the one to find them. Okay? Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. But I, not you, not anyone else. My case. Yeah, well in the meantime, I'm the one that's sweepin' up after 'em. They're my ghosts! I'm gonna be the one... To catch them. CALLAN: The cross is my legacy. CALLAN: I'll keep fighting. CALLAN: Until it's done.
