Like me You won't get such an affectionate cow anywhere in the world True Even I do feel like that But don't be over smarï¬‚! Panchyath president told me he would give me a loan to purchase another one like this. That is good I said no. Why should I have another one when she is here No..But when they make an offer Whatever is the offer when my Lakshmi is here why do I need another one? No other cow will be like this one She is listening..Look She must have understood Definite|y..They are more intelligent than us..but can't speak.That is all They give loans to everyone from panchayath?....?

Look at the o|die's character!! Take this Eat this However busy is he, he takes care of these goats so welll! I like people who work sincerely. That is the culture in the Gulf. Didn't I tell you? Will your wife stay there alone? Isn't she new to this place? Has she become familiar to this place? She belongs to this place, sir. She was working in Nilakkal house Then, the place must be familiar to her. When Lakshmi is there as a com panion,. No worries For you, the cow is more im portanfl! That is true. Animals are grateful beings. Human beings are an ungrateful lot. Whenl used to come from the Gulf I used to help everyone here And no one is grateful" Nowl don't get even one of them in an emergency And I don't go begging to these guys That is my policy I do whatever has to be done at the proper time.

Let it be close ups Who are these? Police? No..He is the new forest ranger Police has been informed. May be they will come soon But.. I can't believe this The end of the world may begin like this.

Let us go there Let us go and see Truly speaking the president is quite tired. How are you now? Relieved? Yes Then tell us. What happened? As I woke up in the morning, what I saw was the head of this buffalo.. That too pierced on an iron rod Was terribly shocked to see that He is trembling even now Did you hear any sound at night? Nothing in particular. lam sure it is the tiger Can't be sure. The buffalo's head was pierced on the iron rod..isn't it? May be it got stuck there when the tiger was carrying it. The president itself is in such dire straits. Then what would be the villagers' plight!!? That is right. Today it came here. Tomorrow it might come to our place We are not trying to leave it. There will be actions from our side. Still, you villagers have to be careful How can we be more careful Don't you have guns to kill it? Can't do it like that If we confirm that it is a tiger, then we have to inform the head office first. The orders have to come from there. We will do the necessary things Ok Ok..Then let us leave That was foolish of me. Someone was ready to buy it for 45,000 bucks. Didn't give. And, now the tiger took it off.. How long we will have to wait for the policemen? That is right Anyhow..on|y this much happened. What are you talking about? In was thinking how the tiger could pierce it so we||!! We have to start it from the scratch now. The remains of the buffalo would be lying somewhere Look..There is the house Come May that is the one we intended Let us go and see Not as we thought.This is a valuable asset. If he agrees, pay him immediately Can we take it in the jeep? Doesn't matter. We will come with a bigger vehicle If we delay it... Isn't it Ram ettan? Yes We just pulled up when we were going this way. We were talking about this poor animal How many animals have been killed by the tiger. It doesn't bother if it is a goat, cow or pig It is better to sell it off for whatever price you get. To tell you frankly, we liked the animal. For a wedding. Will pay you in cash now itself It is not wise to have the cow here under the present circumstances. Why should you give it to the tiger for free Tell us the price. We will buy. There is no tiger here. What nonsense are you talking? Even in the president's house it made a lot of trouble. lam not selling this cow. This is the only onel have That is what we are also asking. Why do you want to throw it into the jungle? If you have come for this..No She is my soul What are you talking. How long can you live here with a tiger on the prowl Think about it, brother.it is getting late We will make a move Walk ahead See you dear What you said is right. She is worth a million Can't leave it like that. We have to get it by hook or crook Yes..And we have to do it fast See... someone is going Someone with head covered. Catch him..Stop there Don't leave him I said stop Remove the covering cloth What are you doing here at this time? I was in an emergency.. Be careful at night The tiger eats not only goats and cows but it can eat men also But still..what does he need at night? May be he has his own reasons.. You walk ahead He wants to know his urgency.. Walk ahead Where is the tiger hiding? If it sees you sitting like this it will immediately jump on you SW? Ramabhadra..is the cow ok? She is ok Ramabhad ra.. Atiger is on the prowl. Be careful When you wait for the tiger, the girl who has gone might come back. Ramabhadra.. If you hear any sound hit the drum loudly Yes Be very careful when you get out.

You didn't have enough feed today" ls it? I will buy it tomorrow from the market. You sleep.. Dear Didn't we see that while were coming? Not a drop of water even in the rivulet The drought is more severe in the forest than in the plains When wild animals don't get water they migrate to the countryside. But we have to do some actions to pacify the people. Things are not as we think That is what I too want to say. Lot of people lost their reared animals. The dept. Should have taken action earlier itself with the cooperation of the public. Oh..That Er..Just a sec. Manmathan sir..We are waiting here. It is time for him to come. It is there Some villagers are just arriving 0k sir You should come tomorrow also and buy jiggery. Take your cattle feed and the other provisions Today's Kera|a.. [Lottery publicity] I have been buying you since so many years. Shall I win this one? Sure Sir Don't you want? I don't buy lotteries What is the problem. There are forest depot officials". They are waiting for the panchayath president. To fix the location. Usually he comes on time. Don't know what happened For what? Going to fix a trap in the forest. That would be the end of the tiger. The forest dept is actually working hard to help the villagers. Take your balance cash. Where is the trap being set? They came for deciding on that ls there a tiger really? What sort of a person are you? You don't know what is happening around you. You take care of your cow. Don't know when it will be grabbed. Still... If it goes on like this will happen? That tiger doesn't think on those lines. Don't talk nonsense. Atiger!! It has to get a horn to play the drum!! Ramabhadran is here. Let us tell him the news. ltold just a day back. Now see what has happened. What happened? Another problem in president's house. The head of a buried buffalo has come out The surprising thing is that it has no horns. He saw it when he came out sometime back. He fainted as he saw that. We are going there.if you want you can come You come Don't think too much. Come with us His case is worse...What to do? Drink this What is this? Drink this water The buffa|o's horns.. They are good for making handles for knives. Maybe someone who wanted that took it off.. President.. I doubt if this was done by Gopalan, the blacksmith Only he can have such guts..... ...To pull out the head of the buffalo at night. Nowl doubt if someone is doing all these in the name of a tiger. When did this happen? I don't know. I went out to the compound after I slept off for sometime Should not leave it like this We have to find out the truth behind this That is important Yes Any way, we will meet Gopalan and come back We have to know what is the reality Oh..You reached? You just dig a deep pit and bury the buffalo's head? But shouldn't we inform the police? lam feeling depressed. |f| get someone to look after you well, I could have ended my life. Why should I have a life like this? I was just joking, Girl. Where can I go leaving you alone? I know your tricks!! But don't make this a habit. Understand?

I felt very sorry seeing that animal standing alone You didn't recognize us? We had come home the other day. And we almost reached an agreement on the case of that cow. I didn't tell anything. I am not selling it You keep quite, boys. These are my boys. Slightly over smart since they are young. We elders will talk and decide. You, youngsters don't interfere. You have no way out..brother We are businessmen since generations. When we make a profit you should not beara loss lam insistent on that I came here because she is a fine cow Just this one is enough for a wedding party ofa thousand persons What else can we do? There is also this tiger on the prowl There is no tiger here. And I am not selling this Don'tjump into such conclusions, Bro Don't be scared. This is a five hundred rupee currency No I don't need Just think that everything is for the good. Then we will leave Sir.. I know that you don't feel like leaving this place. Doesn't matter. For the time being, your suspension has been shelved. Now, even if you are transferred to Wy nad or Nilam bur we will bring you back here. We need you here. This is better than scotch..great That is why I said you keep your foreign liquor aside. Let us try the country liquor. Then there is no point in blaming us If you drink this, you will be floating in heaven That is true I will come back to this range maybe in six months. But the problem is that by the time I return these fellows will ruin the forest. Yes..These guys, who gave all this, are denuding the forests. Sir..Not like that. They take five or six loads in an emergency. That is all But these emergencies have become regular nowadays. The side dishes are over? Over...? Molly Kutty.. This is really excellent I prepared all this Learned it during my life in the gulf So were you a cook there? Whatever" Thomachan's preparation is excellent Since it is your send-off.

I was about to throw up seeing all this. I can't even think about that. Don't think about that. Pack the remaining and let us send it to Varkey chettan's house You can do it yourself. I can't. Kill the other one too. That will make you merrier I have an intention of keeping it here. The tiger will fall into the trap. After that we don't have to afraid of that. That is why I don't to want to kill that She will put on 5 kgs more weight in three months. Then we will think about it. Sir He has come. Where were you..you ass? How long should I wait for you.

No Not like that Sir How do you know that? He has been limping since many days. We all know that. It is said that he was hit by a bicycle. A very nice one.How aristocraticl! It should not go to them in any case Who is that? You come here. We want to see you What happened? We heard something. Heard that your cow has been sold. That too to some slaughterers. ls it true? No Don't do that. Don't you know that killing a cow is a sin? Are you feeding it well? Where is its calf? It has not delivered. Doesn't look like that. Did you sell that too? They will come again to bargain. Tell them we are here. Look He is not well. Let us go Let us see if a slaughterer takes it away when we are all here. Let us see.. Yes What happened?

I told you I will come with you to a doctor It is ok Where are you goimg limping like this? lam going to Thomas sir's house. So you didn't know anything? Tiger got into his house last night. When he saw the tiger through the window Thomachan fainted. He is not conscious even now. He is in hospital now. You go there if you want to meet him I heard about that. Sister had sent someone to me to go there ls it. 0k Then. In the evening, the president has convened a meeting. To discuss about the tiger If possible, you also should come Poor guy Sister Your leg is not ok yet? That is why you were not seen here. Didn't you knowthe news? What happened? He fainted seeing the tiger at night. He says he saw the tiger in our front yard. I checked and could not see a tiger's footstep even He must have just felt it. If the tiger had really come this goat would not have remained here. That is out opinion too. If the tiger had come it would have eaten the goat first. But he is very scared. He is delirious. Anyway, the president has convened a meeting to decide about the tiger. If possible, you too attend that Has he regained consciousness? I have to go and check. lam going to the hospital I have kept your food there. |f| don't go immediately he will get angry. My brother's son. I asked him to stand by when I came here We are going through times of severe challenges that we haven't faced till now. Ourselves and our ancestors who fought against all sons of natural calamities to make a living .are going through serious crisis. We have experienced wild elephant attacks on our farmlands since many years. Should wild elephants come to our homes, then? It's ok. Speak softly. Everyone of you know that we are facing another challenge now. The goats, buffalos and cows that we rear for making a living are being threatened by a tiger, I don't know if it is just one tiger or a large number of them That tiger is having a free prowl on our land. The govts at the centre and the state have not been listening... ...to our complaints and demands for protection, from wild animal attacks. But I must say that some of them have been helpful The forest dept helped us as much as they can But no tiger fell into their tiger trap. And we have lost hope that one would get trapped In the meantime, the tiger continues its attack We have arranged this meeting in such a situation President" Don't take things in such a silly fashion Let the forest dept go to hell What we need now is a surgical strike The tiger should be caught under the leadership of the panchayath. Because some people have arrived here to buy our cows in the name of the tiger threat. Stop it. None should play a tiger and cow game here. We need freedom to rearthe cows. Under the threat of the tiger we should give freedom to people to sell the comrs. No one should talk against that. In the name of a tiger, we will not let anyone kill all our cows and sale beef here. Try doing that somewhere else Get lost..Dude Those eat food will decide what they should eat. That is not right. This is a country where millions worship cow as their mother. Sit down there You sit first Please be calm and listen to me Listen to me. Listen to me Hello Sit down or else I will dissolve the meeting now. Don't look at this in a communal angle. This is an issue that concerns the existence of the people here Due to that tiger we have already lost a large number of animals. And the number of the lost animals will only increase. So, all of you should unite to solve this problem If you here any strange noise hit the drums to let others know I would like to remind you that if a common enemy attacks us... ...if we don't stand united that will lead to our destruction only Manoj, Isn't it him going? Let us ask about the cow? Why didn't you attend the meeting today? I had come. Since I was not well I didn't sit though fully. Your cow is alright...? Oh..Nothing If someone comes to buy that, let us know Understand?
