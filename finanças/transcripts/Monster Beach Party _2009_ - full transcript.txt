HOW CAN I HELP? WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD I.D. THAT DEBRIS. THAT'D BE A START ON FIGURING THIS THING OUT. AND THERE'S THIS. OH, MY GOD. IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG GORILLA FOOT, DOESN'T IT?

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER TOLD YOU THIS STORY, TILLIS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MUCH. WHAT IS IT, JOHN? SPIT IT OUT, SON. WHEN I WAS A KID, UP UNTIL I WAS 10 YEARS OLD, MY PARENTS WOULD GO TO THE EVERGLADES TO LOOK FOR BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES TO TAKE TO THEIR LAB AT THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE. I HAD HEARD THE STORIES ALL MY LIFE, BUT MY PARENTS... WELL, THEY TREATED THEM LIKE THEY WERE FAIRY TALES. WE'D SEE ANIMAL CARCASSES DEVOURED OR TREES MANGLED, AND ALWAYS THE SMELL, LIKE A WET DOG OR A DEAD ANIMAL, BUT A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE. MY DAD WOULD ALWAYS COME UP WITH AN EXPLANATION FOR THE THINGS WE SAW... FLORIDA PANTHERS, ALLIGATORS, LIGHTNING STRIKES. I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER WAS SO SURE. WHEN I WAS OLD ENOUGH, THEY'D TAKE ME WITH THEM INTO THE SWAMP. ONE DAY... AND TO THIS DAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY... THEY LEFT ME BACK AT FORT LONESOME. THEY WENT OUT TO COLLECT SAMPLES FROM DEEP IN THE SWAMP. THEY NEVER CAME BACK. A COUPLE DAYS LATER, THEY FOUND THEIR AIRBOAT ADRIFT... WITH THAT SMELL ON IT. I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, THAT'S QUITE A STORY, SON, BUT WHAT THE HELL'S IT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING? BIGFOOT, SASQUATCH, YETI. IN THE EVERGLADES, IT'S THE SKUNK APE, AN ANTEDILUVIAN SIMIAN CREATURE WITH NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF ITS EXISTENCE... JUST OCCASIONAL SIGHTINGS, SOME SPARSE HAIR SAMPLES, MAYBE A FOOTPRINT ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT ALWAYS THAT SMELL. ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF IT, YOU'LL NEVER FORGET IT. I HAVE A FILING CABINET FULL OF NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS OF ALL THE SIGHTINGS. I'VE KIND OF BEEN DOING MY OWN RESEARCH ON THE THING EVER SINCE MY PARENTS DISAPPEARED. HOW WOULD A THING LIKE THAT GET UP HERE? "UP HERE"? NOW WAIT A SECOND. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I THINK WE NEED TO SEE THAT BEACH DEBRIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HECTOR SAYS IT'S A GOOD CAR. IT'LL BE FINE ONCE WE GET THE NEW ALTERNATOR. AND WHEN'S THAT? TOMORROW. WHAT ABOUT JACKSONVILLE? I CALLED THE CLUB, AND I TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. AND YOU'RE CERTAIN HE CAN FIX IT BY TOMORROW? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. OKAY. [ SIGHS ] WHERE DO WE STAY TONIGHT? THERE'S A MOTEL DOWN THE BEACH WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE. HECTOR SAY THAT, TOO? [ CHUCKLES ] HOW ARE WE GONNA PAY FOR ALL THIS? WE HAVE ENOUGH CASH FOR THE MOTEL. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CAR. HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA BE? I DON'T KNOW. HECTOR SAID NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT. [ BOTH LAUGH ] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? [ Laughing ] LET'S JUST CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE COME TO IT. COME ON. LET'S GO TO THE BEACH. [ SIGHS ] IT'S DEFINITELY EVERGLADES MANGROVE TREES. THE OKEFENOKEE HAS A DIFFERENT SPECIES. OHH, GOD! I AIN'T NEVER SMELLED NOTHING LIKE THAT! HOLD ON A SECOND. WHAT IS IT, JOHN? [ SNIFFS ] NOW YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME THAT'S FROM YOUR MONKEY. SKUNK APE. BOB. IT LOOKS LIKE PRIMATE HAIR, BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN SOME TESTS TO BE SURE. SO, THE DEBRIS IS FROM THE EVERGLADES. SO WHAT? THAT DON'T PROVE NOTHING. I'VE SEEN SAMPLES LIKE THIS BEFORE. NOW, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL HOW LONG IT'S BEEN DETACHED FROM THE ANIMAL THAT IT CAME FROM AND IF IT DID COME FROM THE SKUNK APE. HOW LONG HAS THIS DEBRIS BEEN HERE? WE GOT THE CALL ABOUT 18 HOURS AGO. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE, BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT THIS HAS COME OFF THE ANIMAL ABOUT... 8 HOURS AGO. CAN I SET UP MY EQUIPMENT IN YOUR OFFICE? WELL, OF COURSE. GREAT. NOW, THESE TESTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO RUN ALL NIGHT, BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND SOME ANSWERS IN THE MORNING. THINGS COULD BE WORSE. I MEAN, A DAY AT THE BEACH IS NOT SO BAD. WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY NEW FANS THIS WAY. WELL, YEAH, BUT... BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL GET TAN FOR OUR SHOWS NOW. OH, NOW, CATS AND KITTENS, I KNOW YOU GOT THOSE SPADES AND SHOVELS IN YOUR HANDS HALFWAY TO CHINA, BUT DIG THIS... IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIG WIND. FLORIDA IS BRACING FOR ANOTHER HIT FROM HURRICANE DOROTHY. NOW, THE WEATHER MAN'S SAYING THE STORM HAS REVERSED DIRECTION AND IS TURNING BACK TO HIT THE SUNSHINE STATE A SECOND TIME. SO, LISTEN UP SURFERS... IF YOU THINK YOU BRAVE, GET OUT YOUR CAVE AND CATCH THAT GLORY WAVE. GREAT, A HURRICANE... JUST WHAT WE NEED. IT'LL BE OKAY, THEODORA. IT'S WAY DOWN IN SOUTH FLORIDA.

YEAH, I HEARD IT, TOO. CAME OUT TO SEE IF I COULD HELP. CAN WE GET JUST GET OUT OF HERE? THERE'S A PHONE AT THE GARAGE. WE CAN CALL THE POLICE. OKAY. ON THE BEACH. I DON'T KNOW. UM, NOT FAR FROM THE MOTEL. START AT THE STATE PARK, WHERE THE MARSH MEETS THE BEACH. BOB'S ON HIS WAY TO CHECK IT OUT NOW. I'LL TAKE THEODORA TO THE MOTEL. I'LL BE BACK IN 15 MINUTES. CALL ME, AND I CAN HELP... YOU GO BACK TO THE MOTEL AND STAY PUT. LET THE POLICE TAKE CARE OF THIS. SHERIFF... [ RECEIVER SLAMS ] OW! [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] THE POLICE ARE CHECKING IT OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS? I-I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU STAYING AT THE MERRIVILLE MOTEL? YEAH. CAN I WALK YOU BACK? I'M OKAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I'M OKAY NOW. WELL, A-A-ACTUALLY, I'M STAYING THERE MYSELF, SO... I MEAN, WE COULD WALK SEPARATELY, BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY THIS ONE ROAD. I COULD TAKE THIS SIDE, YOU COULD TAKE THE OTHER, AND WE COULD AVOID EYE CONTACT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST GO. [ WAVES CRASHING ] WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TOGETHER ALMOST FOUR YEARS. CAROL AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE 7th GRADE. WE THINK THAT IF THE SHANGRI-LAS CAN HAVE A HIT, WHY CAN'T WE? YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. PEOPLE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING. I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE A LIVING PLAYING MUSIC. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE DOING IF YOU WEREN'T A MUSICIAN? I HAVE NO IDEA. THERE'S ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE... ANYTHING ELSE THAT I WOULD RATHER BE. I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT... THAT WE'LL MAKE IT. AND IF YOU DON'T? YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. I STILL HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE IT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU'RE DOING, THEN THE END RESULT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU MAKE IT BIG AND FAMOUS, RICH, WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IF I START TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT I'M DOING IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME, I GET DEPRESSED, LIKE, "WHAT AM I DOING HERE? JUST PASSING TIME, WORKING SOME 9:00-TO-5:00 JOB, WAITING TO DIE. EVERYBODY NEEDS A PASSION. YEAH. I THINK SO. TOO MANY PEOPLE DON'T. DOES THAT LEAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE? LIKE WHAT? LIKE... I DON'T KNOW... ROMANCE? YEAH [CHUCKLES] I TRIED THAT. DIDN'T WORK. NO? NO. WANT TO TELL ME THE STORY? NO. ALL RIGHT. I WENT FROM THE MARSH TO THE END OF THE STATE PARK, WHERE THE DEBRIS IS... NEVER FOUND ANYTHING. YOU GET ANY FOOTPRINTS? THE WIND WAS BLOWING PRETTY HARD, SO THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF FOLLOWING FOOTPRINTS OR ANY KIND OF TRAIL. WAS THERE ANY ACTIVITY AROUND THE DEBRIS? I DIDN'T SEE ANY NEW FOOTPRINTS AROUND IT LAST NIGHT OR THIS MORNING, BUT IT'S PRETTY TORN UP. THE TIDE TOOK MOST OF IT LAST NIGHT. [ DOOR CLOSES ] HE'S PROBABLY ABANDONED IT. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT, JOHN? WELL, I THINK IT WAS A KIND OF NEST... HIS HOME. THAT'S WHY THE ODOR WAS SO BAD. I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA RETURN TO IT. WELL, GOOD. WELL, NO, NOT REALLY. HE'S PROBABLY LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME. WELL, WHICH DIRECTION IS HE GONNA GO? WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION HE'S GONNA GO. I'M NOT EVEN CONVINCED WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR YOUR APE CREATURE. SKUNK APE. WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL CONVINCE YOU. THE HAIR SAMPLES MATCHES THOSE THAT I'VE FOUND IN THE EVERGLADES. SO WHAT? AND THE TEST SHOWS THAT IT CAME OFF THE ANIMAL ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS FRANK'S DEATH. SO, WE GOT A GORILLA... SKUNK APE. ...ON THE LOOSE, KILLING PEOPLE? I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE SKUNK APE IS HERE, IN MERRIVILLE ISLAND. HOW DO YOU THINK IT GOT HERE, JOHN? THAT DEBRIS, HIS NEST... IT MUST HAVE BEEN WASHED OUT TO SEA WHEN THAT HURRICANE HIT FLORIDA. ONCE IT ENTERED THE GULF STREAM, IT WAS SWEPT UP THE COAST, DUE TO WARM WATERS AND A NORTHERN HIGH-PRESSURE SYSTEM. AND IT HAPPENED TO END UP HERE, IN MERRIVILLE ISLAND. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. COULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT SURVIVE IN THE OPEN SEA FOR DAYS ON END? IT COULD HAVE, EXCEPT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LARGE THIS DEBRIS WAS WHEN IT WAS SWEPT OUT INTO THE GULF. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MASSIVE AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT. [ CHUCKLES ] OKAY, ASSUME WE DO HAVE A GORILLA... A SKUNK APE... LOOSE ON THE ISLAND. HOW DO WE STOP HIM? THIS CREATURE HAS LIVED ITS ENTIRE LIFE IN A SWAMP. THIS CLIMATE, THIS ENVIRONMENT, IS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO IT. IT MUST BE SCARED, CONFUSED, ALMOST IN A CONSTANT PANIC. THAT'S WHY IT'S ATTACKING ANYONE IT SEES. UH-HUH. HOW DO WE FIND IT AND KILL IT? I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. THIS CREATURE IS THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN MAN AND APE. THIS IS WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR FOR DECADES. IF WE CAN CAPTURE HIM, CAPTURE HIM ALIVE... [ LAUGHS ] NOW HOLD ON THERE. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. I HAVE A DEAD OFFICER AND TWO MISSING PEOPLE. EVERY HOUR THAT PASSES PUTS THEM A STEP CLOSER TO BEING SIX FOOT UNDER. [ CLEARS THROAT ] I AIN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN... NOT HERE, NOT IN MY TOWN, NOT WHILE I'M THE SHERIFF. WE CAN STOP THIS. WE DON'T HAVE TO DESTROY IT. EITHER WAY, FIRST WE HAVE TO FIND IT. OH, YOU GO ON. WE'LL... WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE. GO. GO ON. HEY! WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? WOULD YOU SIGN THIS? THAT'S FROM THE OTHER NIGHT, ISN'T IT? ACTUALLY, I GOT THAT ONE OUT OF YOUR CAR. BUT THE GUY AT THE RADIO STATION SAID HE'D PLAY IT IF I GOT HIM A COPY. TAKE IT OFF MY BILL. DONE. [ CHUCKLES ] CAN I TAKE YOU OUT TO LUNCH? WHAT ABOUT THE CAR? THE ALTERNATOR'S HERE. THE GUYS WILL HAVE IT DONE THIS AFTERNOON. YOU'RE NOT WORKING ON IT? I'M THE BOSS. THIS IS JUST FOR SHOW. I SEE. SO, HOW ABOUT IT? LUNCH IS ON ME. NO, I-I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK TO THE GIRLS. DAMN IT. [ CHUCKLES ] WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. WE SHOULD GO BACK AND GET A MECHANIC TO HIT ON US. I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PUSHING HER. SHE'S GOT TO COME OUT OF THIS ON HER OWN. CAROL, SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS FUNK FOR FIVE YEARS.

SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? TOLD THEM WHAT... THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KILLED THAT GIRL, THAT WE GOT A BIGFOOT RUNNING LOOSE ON THE ISLAND? SKUNK APE. SHUT UP, BOB.

IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S HEADING SOUTH, HIDING DURING THE DAY AND MOVING ALONG THE BEACH AT NIGHT. IF THAT'S TRUE, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CORNER HIM AT THE TIP OF THE ISLAND, NEAR THE OLD SPANISH FORT. RIGHT. EVENTUALLY, HE'S GOING TO RUN OUT OF ISLAND. BOB, CLOSE THE BEACHES. CALL IT RED TIDE, WHATEVER... I DON'T CARE... BUT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ON THAT BEACH.
