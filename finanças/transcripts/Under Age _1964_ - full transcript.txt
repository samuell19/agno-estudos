Ruby Jenkins, stand up, please. Arraign the defendant. [Adkins] In the name and by the authority of the state, the grand jurors do present in and to the criminal district court of this county, that one, Ruby Jenkins... Is that your name? Yes, sir. On or about the 16th day of April, in this year of our Lord in the state of foresaid, did then and there unlawfully ravish, and have carnal knowledge of Linda Jenkins. A female under the age of 18 years, the said Linda Jenkins, not being the wife of Ruby Jenkins. Ruby Jenkins, do you understand the charge? Yes, Your Honor. [Judge] How do you plead? Not guilty. -[Judge] Not guilty? -Yes, sir. Did you hear that ladies and gentlemen of the jury? She pleads not guilty. Mr. Adkins... who was the first witness for the state? Your Honor, we'd like to call George Gomez. For the benefit of the witness, the jury, and the court, let me explain that the rule of evidence has been invoked in this case. And that means this, the witnesses who have already been sworn will remain outside the courtroom until they are called to testify. You are not to discuss this case with anyone, except the attorneys. Now, go ahead with your evidence, please. Yes, sir. Your name is George Gomez? That is right. George, how old are you, George? Sixteen. How old were you in April? April 16th to be exact. Fifteen. Fifteen years old. Uh, what grade in school were you in at that time? Ninth grade. And what school was this? Granite Junior High. George, do you know a girl by the name of Linda Jenkins? Yes, sir, I do. You two were pretty close? Yes. We loved each other. You loved each other? You mean you had a crush on her, a kind of puppy love? No. Well, I walked her home from school every day, and I put her mark on my arm. Your Honor, are you putting this boy's arm into evidence? Well, I don't think that's exactly what he has in mind. Your Honor, I should like to have this witness on voir dire. I'm not going to enter the tattoo into evidence. I object, Your Honor. The prosecution obviously doesn't believe in young love. The boy testified that he had a genuine love for this girl. And Mr. Adkins is twisting it into nothing but puppy love. And then trying to hide the evidence that will prove him wrong. I think I'd overrule you on that. What, Your Honor, that's what this whole case is about. We intend to prove that these young people were madly in love and nobody could keep them apart! But, Your Honor, the prosecution will prove that Ruby Jenkins manipulated this whole affair, and nothing would have happened if she hadn't promoted it. [bangs gavel] And now that you've had equal time, gentlemen, can we now take our proper places, and proceed in an orderly manner? [indistinct chatter] [Adkins] Now, George, do you know this girl's mother, Ruby Jenkins? Yes, sir, I do. Directing your attention to last April 15th, will you state the facts as to whether or not you had a telephone conversation with Linda Jenkins? I did, sir. [Adkins] Now, George, you cannot tell the jury what you and Linda talked about. However, I will ask you, if she left the telephone from time to time, and then would come back and say something to you. She did, sir. During these times that Linda left the telephone and returned, did her mother say anything to you on the phone? Yes, sir, she did. Well, tell the jury as best you can, what Ruby Jenkins said to you on the telephone. Well, sir... Mrs. Jenkins came to the phone, Linda had asked her if it was all right for us to have relations. We object to that, Your Honor. [Judge] Sustained. Now you can't tell what Linda told you. You just tell what Ruby Jenkins told you. I'll handle it, Mr. Adkins. I sustained Mr. Tyler's objection because you can only relate just exactly what the defendant herself told you. Nothing else. -Now, go ahead. -Yes, sir. Well, she came into the phone-- By she, you mean Ruby Jenkins? Yes, sir. She started speaking to me about sex and all about it. She started discussing what would happen. That you would have to use the Norgines. I didn't hear you. Linda would have to use some Norgines. Now, these... these Norgines, they're a female medication? [Tyler] I object to that, Your Honor. Unless counsel would qualify the witness is an expert. [Judge] Sustain it. Well, then, in effect, on that day over the telephone, you agreed with Ruby Jenkins to have intimate relations with her daughter, Linda? [Gomez] Yes, sir. When was this to take place? The next day, after I took her home from school... Mrs. Jenkins said that would be a good time, because she would be at work. Did you see Linda the next day? Yes, sir. [inaudible conversation] [slow instrumental music playing] [Adkins] What happened when you got to her house? [Gomez] We were startled to find her there. [Adkins] Mrs. Jenkins? [Gomez] Yes, sir. [Adkins] Was there a conversation between you and Mrs. Jenkins? [Gomez] Yes, sir. [Adkins] Tell the court what was said and done. [Gomez] She told Linda to go put her books up and go to the bathroom. I was shaking all over. I was so nervous. She said It would be all right, because... in the eyes of God, we would be married by nature. [Adkins] She said... "In the eyes of God, you would be married by nature"? That's right. Because we loved each other. [Adkins] When they left the bathroom, what did Mrs. Jenkins say to you? She said, "Don't be scared. It'll be over real quick and you'll be glad of it." [Adkins] That you'll be glad of it? [Gomez] That we would be married anyway when we were 18. I told her I... I didn't want my mother to find out. It would shock her. She kept saying there was nothing to worry about, and told us to go on back to the bedroom. [Adkins] Where was Mrs. Jenkins when you last saw her? In the hall. [Adkins] And then where did you go? [Gomez] To Linda's bedroom. [Adkins] Now tell us in your own words what each of you did. [Gomez] I told her I would have to do what her mother told me to. To wait 15 minutes for... for the Norgine to work, so that she would not become pregnant. I kept watching the time, and when the time had come, Linda said, "Make something wonderful happen." "Make something wonderful happen"? Afterwards, what then? I put my clothes on and walked into the front room. I was shaking like everything. [Judge] Son... uh, don't let your voice drop. They can't hear you. Yes, sir. When you got to the front room, what did Linda's mother do then? She asked me how I felt, and I said I felt drastic. You felt what? Drastic. My legs were shaking. I felt nauseated, like... like about to faint or something. So I said goodnight and caught my bus for home. And was this the only time that you had intimate relations with Linda Jenkins? No, sir. They were two other times that I recall. And did her mother, Ruby Jenkins know about these other times? Yes, sir. She told us to. She told you to? That you weren't willing. -[Tyler] Objection. -[Gomez] Neither one of us was. [Tyler] Objection! Objection, Your Honor. He's leading. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Give me time to rule when there is an objection. If I overrule on objection, that means you may answer. If I sustain an objection, you may not. I sustain it here. So proceed. Now, George, answer me this. Have you ever had intimate relations with anyone besides Linda Jenkins? No, sir. I have not We pass the witness, Your Honor. [Gomez] George, you don't mind my asking you a few questions, do you? That's what he's here for, Mr. Tyler When did you start going with Linda? Was it last semester? [Gomez] Well, I... I couldn't say for sure. I attended two schools last year, so... This was my first year in public school, Was it at last December? February, March? Well, I... Somewhere. Well, your best guess. Somewhere around February? You were going steady, weren't you? With Linda? -[Tyler] Yes. -[Gomez] Yes, sir. In fact, you walked her home from school almost every night. Not night, evening. Well, after school. Yes, sir. You spent a lot of time in her house? Yes, sir. Alone? -Yes, sir. -Listening to the records? -Yes, sir. -In her bedroom? Yes. Well... That's where the record player was. Isn't it true that on April 15th, you took her blouse off and petted her? [Adkins] Well, uh, objection. Just answer, yes or no? Your Honor, we object. Overruled you, Mr. Prosecutor. Answer the question. I did. I don't recall the 15th, but... I did do that, yes. Didn't you have relations with Linda on that same day? No, sir. Now, George, while you and Linda were going steady, did you ever give her any money? [Gomez] No, sir. Didn't you, as a matter of fact, buy her cheerleader's uniform? -[Gomez] No, sir. -You didn't do that? [Gomez] No, I didn't. [Tyler] Have you ever seen this before? It looks like the key that opens Linda's house. Opens what? It looks like the key to the back door. Objection. Mr. Tyler, are you offering that key into evidence? [Tyler] You live on the other side of the expressway from Linda, don't you, George? What is it they call that? You mean Little Mexico? Some people call it that. [Tyler] No, George. What do you... What do your people call it? Sal... - Sal si puedes. -[Tyler] Sal si puedes. Get out if you can. And was that what you were trying to do, George? Objection, Your Honor. Harry Tyler's trying to inject prejudice into this trial because of this boy's race. [Judge] Sustained. Has anyone warned you, George, that your testimony in this trial is enough to convict you of statutory rape, when you reach the age 17? I don't know anything about that. Didn't the district attorney offer you immunity if you would testify against Ruby Jenkins In this case? All they said was to tell the truth. Just tell the truth. Now, George... let's move to the day. The first time it's happened. Being at the Jenkins House as much as you were. You were aware of what day of the week Mrs. Jenkins had off from work, weren't you? [Gomez] Yes, sir. I believe it was a... Tuesday. It was a Tuesday. Tuesday afternoon, in fact, wasn't it? I guess so. Why were you surprised to find her there? [Gomez] Pardon me? When you and Linda got home, why were you surprised to find her mother there? [Gomez] Because she said she was going to be at work. Now, George, for the benefit of the judge, and the jury, let's fix in our minds the dates of these alleged intimacies, shall we? First phone call. When you asked Mrs. Jenkins if you could marry her daughter, when was that? [Gomez] That was... April 15th. This Monday. [Tyler] Uh, let's just mark that for clarity Here, you mark it. All right. Now the first intimacy. When was that? That was the next day, April 16th, Tuesday. [Tyler] Mark that if you don't mind. And the second intimacy, when was that? [Gomez] That was the 17th, Wednesday. [Tyler] Mark it. I believe you testified earlier that there were three or four intimacies. Three, sir. The last one was on... Saturday, the 20th. [Tyler] Mark that, too, please. Saturday night. Was that the Saturday night you were supposed to be at a Boy Scout meeting? [Gomez] No, sir. That was the night I was supposed to go to the Midnight Mass. [Tyler] Do you have Midnight Mass every Saturday night? Now we object to that, Your Honor. The boy is testifying in regard to his own religion, Your Honor. Sustained. Just ask him about the night in question. This midnight mass. It was a High Mass, wasn't it? I presume so. [Tyler] High Mass. Just on special days, like Easter. Well, George, if that was a Saturday night before Easter, your first intimacy was at least two days before you had this famous telephone conversation with Ruby Jenkins. Where you learned all about the birds and bees. [Adkins] Objection. [Judge banging gavel] [Judge] Sustained. George, you know the difference between love and lust? You told Mr. Adkins over here that you and Linda loved each other. Didn't you mean lust? No. I loved her. Is that why you put that tattoo on your arm? A lot of us do that to show we're in love. Could the jury see that, please? What do those letters stand for? George Gomez... loves Linda Jenkins. Thank you, George. Stand down, please. Call your next witness. Call Sybel Riley. You are the sister of the defendant, Ruby Jenkins. -Is that right? -Half-sister. We have the same mother. And how long have you known the defendant's daughter, Linda? All of her life. Do you know George? Do you mean the Mexican boy? No. No, I didn't know him very well. Didn't he come over to your house with Linda? He has never been to my house. Is, uh, Linda staying at your house now? Yes, sir. Now, how long has she been staying there? Since July the 19th, of this year. Now, directing your attention to July 21st. Will you state the facts as to whether or not you took Linda Jenkins to the juvenile home? I did. And did she have a conversation with the juvenile workers? Yes, she did. Now directing your attention to July 28th. Will you state the facts as to Ruby Jenkins, when you visited her home at 565 Meadowbrook? Well, my mother had called, and said they had put Ruby in jail, and that she needed some things, clothes and things. And would I go to her house and get some things and take them down to the jail? -[Adkins] And you did this? -[Riley] Yes. [somber music playing] [Riley] I gathered the things together. [Adkins] Now, relate the facts as to whether or not you found any female medications among her effects. [Riley] Yes, I did. Two different kinds. Thank you, Mrs. Riley. Pass the witness. Mrs. Riley. You've known that George has been dating Linda for quite some time now, haven't you? Yes, I've known about it. Did you object to that? Of course I objected. Linda shouldn't go out with that kind of a boy. What do you mean, "that kind of a boy"? Why... you know... No, I don't know. What do you mean? Why, he's a Mexican boy! A Mexican boy! And is that the reason you went down to the juvenile home and started all this? Because your sister let her daughter go out with a Mexican boy? No, that's not right. She's the one who called the judge and told him that I had kidnapped her daughter. I just wanted them to know the straight of it. Now, Mrs. Riley, when Linda came to you with this wild tale of promiscuity, of course, you called her mother to get the denial, or confirmation of it. -Didn't you? -No, sir. [Tyler] You didn't do that? No. Linda told me what happened. You mean that you convicted your sister of a serious crime without getting her side of the story? -[Adkins] Objection. -The truth is, Sybel Riley, -you hate your sister. -[Askins] Objection. -You've always hated her. -[Adkins] Objection, Your Honor. -And you're holding... -Objection! Order. Order in this court. Mr. Tyler. Don't ever make an outburst like that again in my courtroom. [Tyler] But, Your Honor, the jury has a right to know what made this woman do what she has done to her sister. You do that again, Mr. Tyler, and I'm going to have you put in jail. Your Honor, we ask that the jury be instructed to disregard this outburst, and it will be stricken from the record. The jury is so instructed. Strike it from the record. No further questions. Stand down please. Call your next witness. Your Honor... we call Linda Jenkins. [indistinct chatter] [chattering stops] You're Linda Jenkins? Yes, sir. In April of this year, how old were you? Fourteen. What? No, I was still 13 then. Linda, do you know a person by the name of George Gomez? Yes, sir. When did you meet him? I met him in January. It was at a hootenanny. -A what? -A hootenanny. [Adkins] Would you describe that for the court and jury? Well, it's just a place where the kids go. They sing folk songs, or are they can sit around and listen. [Adkins] You mean a nightclub, a cabaret? Well, no, no. They... they served Cokes and and coffee. It's just a place where the young people go.

And... later on, George asked me if he could walk me home. And I said, "All right." Directing your attention to April of this year... Will you state the facts as to whether or not, at that time, you were the wife of George Gomez? Well, not legally. I mean, no. Well, were you the wife of... Ruby Jenkins? [audience murmuring] Well, no. Now, directing your attention to the evening of April 15th. Did you and your mother have a telephone conversation with George Gomez? Yes, sir. [Adkins] Under the law, you cannot tell me what the conversation was between you and George Gomez. The court just won't let you do that. Tell what the conversation was with your mother. [slow instrumental music playing] [Linda] Well, she asked me if I wouldn't like to be married to George in the eyes of God. That's what she said. [Adkins] And what did you answer? [Linda] Well, I said no. [Adkins] And what did she say, then? [Linda] Well, she kept on saying that it was all right, and that a lot of people did it. And she didn't see any harm in it, and that I would never regret it. And that I would be perfectly happy the rest of my life. "I'd be perfectly happy... the rest of my life." What else did she say? Well, she told me that it had been arranged for me to have relations with George the next afternoon. And did you? Yes. When I got home from school, mother was there and I was surprised to find her at home and... -Well... -Go on. She took me in... into the bathroom and... she handed me a... a norgine. She said it would keep me from... from getting pregnant. And she kept on saying that... that I would never regret it. And that I would always be happy and... and she was glad I would do it. [Adkins] Now, Linda, a simple yes or no. Did you or did you not have intimate relations with George Gomez on the afternoon of April 16th? Yes, sir, I did. And was your mother in the house at this time? No. Well, yes. She was in the living room, ironing. Objection. How could she know what her mother was doing? [Judge] Sustained. [Adkins] Now, Linda, how many times did you have these... intimate relations with George? Well... there were four times in all, but each time I would tell her I didn't want to. But she just kept on talking, and... and saying that I would never regret it. And... Finally, she just talked me into it. [Adkins] And then what happened? Well, finally, mother and I had an argument, and I told her I never wanted to see George Gomez again, because we had broken up for good. And she said, "Well, you can't break up now, because now you're married in the eyes of God." Then I said it didn't make any difference, and that I didn't believe that, anyway. And I wasn't going out with George anymore. And she says, "If you don't go out with George, you won't go out with anyone as long as you're underage." And I said, "All right, I wouldn't go out with anyone then." And she said, "Oh, yes, you are, because George is coming over here tomorrow night, and you're going into that bedroom with him." And I said, "You go into that bedroom with him. That's what you really want, say it." And what did you do then? Did you strike back? I ran away. [somber instrumental music playing] [Linda crying] I just wanted to die. [Judge] Now, you, reporters. I don't mind you taking photographs in the courtroom. You have a legal right to do so. But do not get between the witness and the jury. [Adkins] Now, directing your attention to July 22nd. Did you have occasion to talk with the officers out at the juvenile home? Yes, sir. I did. And since this thing has gotten into court, have you talked with George Gomez? No, sir. We pass this witness, Your Honor, Linda. Do you remember the day of the telephone conversation? April 15th? Yes, sir. Is it not a fact that on that day George removed your blouse and petted you? That's not true! Then was it the day before? He didn't ever do that? He never did that? No! Not until... the 16th... when we had relations. [Tyler] So... it is your testimony that before the 16th April, George never laid his hands on you indecently? That is true. [Tyler] Either intimate relations or petting? He didn't. [Tyler] You couldn't be mistaken about that? [Linda] No. [Tyler] At that time, did you know anything at all about sex? Well, just what my mother told me. [Tyler] Linda... Is it a fact that earlier in the year you had asked about sex? And you had a book about sex? Aa book you had borrowed from one of your girlfriends. No. [Tyler] You didn't borrow a book about sex. Well, not that I recall. [Tyler] Didn't your mother order through the mail, in a plain brown wrapper, as they say... A manual about sex? Female hygiene... and all the problems young girls of your age have to face. Yes, she gave that to me. Then, Linda, prior to April the 16th, you weren't completely ignorant about the birds and the bees. Well, I don't remember. By the way, Linda, did George ever give you any money? Yes. He... he bought my cheerleader uniform for me. Was that before April the 16th, or after? After. -After? -Yes. [Tyler] You say your mother told you it was all right? Just fine for you kids to have intimate relations. Well... she said... Well, that she went to bed with a man. You say she told you she went to bed with men? Well, yes, she... [Tyler] Your Honor, I believe I have this witness on cross examination. -[Judge] Yes. Now, don't-- -Your Honor, I just want to-- [Judge] Well, if you didn't hear her, Mr. Adkins, if you would just tell me, I'll have the matter read back. [Tyler] I will ask you this. How many times did you and George have these intimate relations? It was four. [Tyler] You had four? Was one of these times a Saturday night? Yes, the third time. [Tyler] Wasn't that the night that George was supposed to have been at Mass? Yes. [Tyler] Could this have been the high mass before Easter? Well, it could have been. Linda, are you aware that Easter was April, the 14th? -Object! -This was two days before these alleged intimacies took place. -The way you kids tell it... -Objection, Your Honor, he's badgering. He's deliberately trying to confuse this witness. Sustained. Let the witness testify, Mr. Tyler. What? Your Honor, that's exactly what I'm trying to do. Let the witness testify... to that truth. The jury will decide as to the truth, Mr. Tyler. Do you recognize this? -But, now... -Yes, that's the key to our back door. Your Honor, would you tell him to either enter that key into evidence, or keep it in his pocket? [Judge] Now you know better than that, Mr. Tyler, You have testified that George and you were never married. Is that correct? Yes, it is. [Tyler] Mark this, please. As defense Exhibit number one. Thank you. I hand you what has been marked as defense exhibit number one, and ask you to identify it, please. Well, it's my Bible. [Tyler] YourBible? Yes. Will you open it to the first page, please? Would you read the inscription there? "To Linda with all my love, George." [Tyler] Are those your lip prints? [Linda] Yes. [Tyler] Sealed with a kiss. Thank you, Linda. That is all. Your Honor... No question. [Judge] Step down, please. Continue, please. Call Dr. Vivian Scott. What position do you hold with the county Health department? Assistant health officer. Now, directing your attention to July 27th. Did you examine a girl by the name of Linda Jenkins? I did. Would you tell the jury what your examination revealed? It revealed... that the girl was no longer a virgin. Thank you, Doctor. Pass the witness, Your Honor. Madam... Is there a positive way to tell that woman is no longer a virgin? Well, there's no 100% way. No. Thank you. No further questions. You through with her? Step down, please. Call your next witness. Your Honor, at this time, the state rests. The court will now recess for lunch until two o'clock. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have got to stay together, eat together, and stay with the bailiffs. Of course you understand that you are not to discuss this case among yourselves. You are not to read any newspapers, listen to any radio, or watch any television. Court is now recessed. [indistinct chatter] Is the defense ready? [Tyler] Yes, Your Honor. Then call your first witness. Call W.J. Earnhardt. [indistinct chatter] State your name please, sir. W.J. Earnhardt. I will ask you whether or not you are the justice of the peace. Yes, sir. [Tyler] Would you state the facts as to whether or not a complaint was filed in your court by the defendant, Ruby Jenkins. Yes, sir. Do you know on what day the charge was filed? On 20th of July. [Judge] They say they can't hear you, Judge. Speak a little louder. Keep your voice up. -[loudly] Yes, sir! -[laughter] Judge Earnhardt, I'm going to ask you to say who the charge was filed against. It was her sister, Miss. Sybel Riley, or something like that. Her sister? Believe that's all. Now, Judge, just what was the charge that was filed? The charge was that Miss Jenkins went over to this lady's house and got her daughter and her clothes. You mean, Mrs. Riley went over and got her daughter's... got the girl's clothes for her? Hell, I don't know which one's which. Which one's mother? Well, the mother is Mrs. Jenkins. Well, Mrs. Jenkins is the one who filed on the other one. Now, said Mrs. Riley went over to her house and got her daughter and her clothes. And took them to her house, and, uh, wouldn't let her daughter go home. Now, Judge, was there actually a criminal charge filed, or... or was it just a matter of getting the deal before you, so you could hear it? The court inquiry. Well, Judge, was there actually a court of inquiry, or did you settle this all over the telephone? I settled it over the phone, as far as I'm concerned. Yes. Thank you for coming down, Judge. Nice to see you. Can I go home now? [audience laughing] You're excused. You may go. Call Wilbur Neal. Now, I understand from this attorney that because of your religion, you do not want to swear to tell the truth. But we'll take an affirmation. And under the law, an affirmation is just as binding. You hereby affirm that the testimony you will give in this matter, now on trial in this court, will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. On the thing that is binding on your conscience? I will. [Tyler] Your name is Wilbur Neal? Yes, sir. [Tyler] I will ask if you are an ordained minister. Yes, I am. [Tyler] Are you acquainted with one George Gomez? Yes, I am. [Tyler] How did you two become acquainted? I was employed at the Westside Community Center last year, and I was his scoutmaster. Are you acquainted with Linda Jenkins? Yes, I met her through George. She was his girlfriend. You know Ruby Jenkins? Yes, I do. How did you become acquainted with Ruby Jenkins? She called me on the phone in March. -That would be before Easter. -Yes. [Tyler] Do you recall what she said that day? She wanted to know if George had ever asked me to marry them. I said yes, he had, but I thought he was just joking. She said that she thought George was serious about wanting to get married to Linda. And she asked me not to marry them. [Tyler] Not to marry? Yes. She called me several times in April and May. Four or five times. [Tyler] Did Mrs. Jenkins ever mention to you that she was suspicious that the children were having intimate relations? Yes. Mrs. Jenkins called me right after the first of May. She told me very bluntly that they had. I said, "Are you sure?" And she said, "Yes." I'm absolutely sure that it has happened. [Tyler] I believe you said you were George's scoutmaster? Yes. [Tyler] Did you ever let George have access to your car? -Yes, I did. -[Tyler] Quite often? Yes, during scout meetings, or shortly before they were over, George would ask me for the car so he could go get Linda. Then later, he would pick me up and I would drive him home. [Tyler] Did you ever notice anything unusual as you... came upon them in the car? Mm, not particularly. [Tyler] Were they necking? There was one instance, several instances when George... when I would be driving Linda back home. Of course, I would be driving and George and Linda would be together. And at these times, he might kiss her once or twice before they got home. That's a goodnight kiss, I suppose. [slow instrumental music playing] I did not feel that my ministerial role was to break it up, because it was perfectly innocent. And I felt they felt it was innocent being with me. [Tyler] Did you loan George your car for other dates? Dates wherein he would be alone with Linda? Yes, several times. [Tyler] Of course, you wouldn't have any way of knowing what happened when they were alone in your car? No. [Tyler] Now, Reverend... would you say that George and Linda were in love? In your opinion. Well, they certainly thought so. [Tyler] And thinking makes it so, doesn't it? [Adkins] Objection. He's leading. Sustained. No further questions. Now, Preacher... You were fairly close to George, weren't you? That's right. [Adkins] Was he a pretty clean-cut boy? Absolutely. [Adkins] Active in the scouts? He was an Eagle Scout. [Adkins] Now that's the highest rank in scouting, isn't it? Yes. I believe his father is an officer in Korea, isn't he? Well, he's in the service somewhere overseas. [Adkins] Now, Preacher, about Linda Jenkins... Didn't she always act like a little lady? I knew very little about Linda. Well, she didn't do anything nasty in front of you, did she? Certainly not. [Adkins] You never heard her swear or anything? No, I object! I mean... no. [Adkins] And you never heard Linda or George discuss sex, did you? No, sir. Now, Preacher, you testified, I believe that Mrs. Ruby Jenkins was afraid that George was going to marry her daughter. You know, of course, that a 13-year-old girl can't get married in this state. I didn't know that, but it's a good law. You married, Preacher? Yes, sir. No more questions. Stand down, please. Call your next witness. Call Barney Jenkins. Your name is Barney Jenkins? [Barney] That's right. What relation are you to the defendant, Ruby Jenkins? She's my ex-wife. We were married in 1947. Then you're the father of Linda Jenkins? [Barney] Yes, sir. [Adkins] I will ask you if during the month of May, you had occasion to be at the residence of Ruby Jenkins. Yes, It was Saturday, the 18th of May, and I remember that was the day, because that's the day I delivered the child support check. [Tyler] Child support check? Then you and Ruby are divorced? Yes, since 1951. [Tyler] Now, was there anyone at home? Well, there didn't appear to be at first, and I walked up the driveway there and knocked on the door. And nobody answered, so I started to walk in, but the latch was latched from the inside, but I could see through the front screen. And I saw this Mexican boy coming out from the bedroom, stuffin' his pants in like this, you know. [Tyler] Was anyone else there? [Barney] Yes, Linda. She was there. She had her shorts on, and when she came out, she was pushing her blouse down into her shorts. She had fresh makeup on and lipstick, and she just combed her hair. [Tyler] Where was your ex-wife at this time? Oh, she had to work that Saturday. So I gave Linda the check and left. When was the next time you were in Ruby Jenkins' home? Well, it was the weekend prior to June 17th. And she told me she thought she was pregnant. -What? -Yeah. Ruby told me she thought Linda was pregnant. What did you do? Well, I got on the extension phone in the other room and Ruby rang up this Mexican boy, and asked him what he was gonna do about Linda? And he said he'd had all he wanted of Linda, "We are through." That is all. And hung up, and that's all he said. -"We are through." -[Tyler] All right. So I called up a friend of mine, and asked about filing a statutory rape charge -against this boy. -[Tyler] Who was this friend that you called? [Barney] Mr. North down at the district attorney's office, He told me to come by and see him. When I came down to file, and I told him I'd be down there next Monday. [Tyler] And did you go on Monday? [Barney] Well, I had... I was having a great deal of difficulty getting around. I was... I was... I was hurting so much. You see, I had this painful operation in my left leg, and I was in such great pain that day that I could hardly even walk. So on that Monday, the doctor put me in the hospital. And did you ever go down to the district attorney's office? No. No further questions. Now, Barney, how long have you known Mr. North and myself down at the district attorney's office? Oh, ever since we were all about ten years old. I believe that you testified that you make child support payments on Linda. -Is that right? -Sure do. Every month. Of course, if she got married, you wouldn't have to make those payments now, would you? -Well, no, but-- -Thank you very much, Barney. -I appreciate you coming down. -No-- Thank you. Your Honor, we will put the defendant on next. All right. Take the stand, please. [audience murmuring] [chattering stops] Uh, has she been sworn? Yes, she has, Your Honor. State your name, please. Ruby Mae Jenkins. [Tyler] Speak right up, please. So everybody can hear you right into the microphone. Ru... [clears throat] Ruby Mae Jenkins. [Tyler] And you're the mother of Linda Jenkins, right? That's right. [Tyler] Do you know George Gomez? Yes. [Tyler] Was he a frequent visitor to your home? Well, up until June, he was. He... He'd be there every afternoon when I got home. [Tyler] What time did you get off work? Five o'clock. [Tyler] Where were you employed? At the Dixie Dry Cleaners, I... I press dresses, and, you know, things like that. [Tyler] How long have you been employed at this job? -[Ruby] Three years. -[Tyler] Now... referring you to April the 15th. I will ask you if anything unusual happened that day? Well, when I got home from work, I... I didn't see Linda at first, and... and I called to her and... and she was in her room. So... so I went back, there's always to say something to her and... She had an odd expression on her face and... and she was nervous. Just very nervous. [Tyler] Go on. So I... I asked her what the matter was, and... and... and she said nothing. But I knew she was lying, because I know my daughter and... Well, eventually, she told me she... She said that George took off her blouse, and had petted her. And well, I gave her a strict lecture on that. I said that that those things, they just don't happen and... and that they're not to happen. [Tyler] And did that end the matter? No, no, that... That night Linda came to me and she said that, that George was on the phone and he wanted to talk to me about the two of them getting married. And... and I said, "Why, Linda, that's ridiculous. You are entirely too young." And she said, "Well, George wants to talk to you about it, so." So I went to the phone and I said, hello and... he said, "Mrs. Jenkins, I would like your permission for me and Linda to get married." [Tyler] He asked you if he could get married to Linda? So I... I said, "George, under no circumstances can I agree to this. You are entirely too young." Did you discuss sex with him? Yes, I... I told him I said, "When people get married, sex follows and... and they have sex relations, and that means children. And what in the world are you gonna do with children, when you're... when you're nothing but children yourself?" And I told him, I said, "You cannot get married." [Tyler] All right now. The following day, April the 16th, Did you work all day that day? -No, I got off at 12:30. -[Tyler] Went home? Yes, I... I, uh, made the bed, and I swept the floor, and I did some dishes and and then I started ironing. [Tyler] Did the kids come home? Yes, about 4:30, Lind and George came in together and... they were talking about the cheerleader campaign. Linda... she was going after a cheerleader and... while they were talking about how it was going, and the parade, and school activities, and things like that. [Tyler] Did they go into Linda's bedroom? Well, yes. Uh... George didn't know how to dance, and Linda was teaching him to dance. And and the record player was on. [Tyler] Could you see them from where you are ironing? I could see everything. Or shadows of everything. I wanted to keep an eye on, because of what Linda had told me the day before. [Tyler] How long were they in the bedroom? Oh, about 15 minutes. I can't be sure. Well, then they came out together, and we talked for a while. And then, George said he'd have to run and catch his bus. [Tyler] Mmm. [Tyler] Did you work the following Saturday, All day. [Tyler] Did anything out of the ordinary happen the next day, Sunday? The thing I was so afraid of... Linda... Linda'd been acting strange all day... she wouldn't look at me when I talked to her. And she just wasn't herself. And that morning, I... [clears throat] I opened my medicine chest and... I noticed that one of my Norgines was missing, I was sure, because there were supposed to be three, and there was only two. And I went to Linda's room, and I said, "Linda, one of my Norgines is missing. You didn't take it, did you?" And she said, "No." But I knew she was lying, because I know my daughter. And I said, "Linda, have you and George been up to something?" And she denied it again. And I grabbed the Bible, because I knew what had happened. And I said, "Linda, now, you swear on this Bible. You swear that you and George haven't been up to something." And, well, she started to put her hand on that Bible, but she couldn't. And then I knew for sure. And I said, "Oh, my God, Linda, those things are nothing but feminine medications, and they won't keep you from getting pregnant." -[Tyler] What did you do? -[audience murmuring] I called Mr. Neal. [Tyler] Preacher who testified here? I asked him what I should do. And I told him that if ever I needed help in making a decision, I needed it now. [Tyler] At a later date, did you discuss this with your former husband Mr. Jenkins? Yes, we talked about it. Barney said he was gonna go down and file charges against George. [Tyler] Did you call George on the telephone that day? -Yes, sir. -Why did you do that? Because we thought Linda was pregnant. [Tyler] Uh-huh. And I asked George what he was gonna do about it. And he said, "Oh, I'm fed up with Linda. I am through with her and that's that." [Tyler] When did you find out Linda was not pregnant? Next day. [Tyler] So you didn't file charges against George with the district attorney after all? Well, no. You see, Linda... When she started in, "Mother, please don't go, and... it'll cause a lot of trouble and it'll be in the papers. And here I am in school... and it'll cause a bad reputation, and things like that. Mother, please don't go." So... I told her that if she agreed never to see that boy George again, that I wouldn't go. Well, I thought that was the end of it. Everything went along all right until about six weeks later. [Tyler] Would that be about July the 19th? That's the day. I found Linda's key ring and I noticed that her key to the back door was missing. [Tyler] Key ring? Oh, well... well, it's not a key ring. It's... just a little key chain, you know, with a four leaf clover on it. [Tyler] Was it a key like this? Mr. Tyler, I have warned you not to show that key again unless you intend to enter it as an exhibit. [Tyler] But, Your Honor, that's exactly what I intend to do. [audience murmuring] [Tyler] Mark this, please. Defense exhibit number two. Any objections, Mr. Adkins? [Adkins] No objections. [Tyler] Admitted. Do you recognize this key? Yes, sir. That's... That's my key to the back door. [Tyler] Does Linda have a duplicate of this key? Well, she did have and... until I noticed it was missing. [somber instrumental music playing] I said, "Linda, do you know that your key is missing for the back door?" And she said, "I lost it." But I knew she was lying. And I said, "Linda, did you give that key to someone? Did you give that key to George? I told you never to see him again. Now, what's he doing sneaking in this house at night while I'm asleep?" And she said that it was none of my business, and she didn't want to talk about it. And I said, "It is so my business. Everything you do is my business as long as you're underage." And she said, "That's not true. I'm old enough to get married." And I said, "You're not old enough to get married. You're just... just my baby." [crying] And she said, "Quit calling me a baby. Won't you ever realize that I'm growing up?" And I said, "You are not growing up, and that... well, you've got to get that key back from George today." And she said, "Oh, no, I won't because we're married. Married in the eyes of God." [sobbing] And I said, "Stop saying that. Do you want people to think that we are nothing but poor White trash?" Did she come home that night? No, she stayed at my sister's. [Tyler] What did you do about that? Well, Linda said she wasn't gonna come home, so... So I called Judge Earnhardt the next day. [Tyler] That's the judge who testified here earlier? Yes, sir, him. He said that he'd try to get Linda back home. [Tyler] Will you state the facts as to whether, at some later date, you received a call from the juvenile home? Yes, they arranged for me to come down, and have an appointment on July 26th and... Well, I thought they had it all worked out for me to take Linda home. When I got there, why... these two police women came up to me and said, "You're under arrest." [Tyler] Did they tell you what the charge was? Well, they said it was for rape. [Tyler] Is this your Bible? No, it's Linda's. Do you recognize this page? That... that's the holy matrimony page. The page I found the day she left. Would you read it aloud for the judge and the jury? "George Gomez and Linda Jenkins were wed and united in holy matrimony." Whose handwriting is it? -It's Linda's. -Linda's? -Mm-hmm. -What is the date? April 15th. April the 15th. Now that was the day before George and Linda claim where these relations took place? Yes. Now, Ruby Jenkins, I want you to tell the jury truthfully, did you ever, by word, act, or gesture... encourage your daughter to have relations with George Gomez? No. No, I didn't do that. I didn't. I realize that... that this was a difficult time in her life, beginning to notice boys and... [sniffles] and wanting nice things. Well, I just did what I thought a good mother should do. I tried to understand, and to offer some help, but she wouldn't open up to me. Well, you just don't know how hard it is when they won't open up. They won't even talk to me. So, I... I tried to get some help from the minister. And from her father, but that didn't help. Well, George and Linda were just too much in love, and nothing could stop them. I felt so alone in wanting to help my baby. Such a baby. [sniffling] Pass the witness. [all murmuring] Mrs. Jenkins? How old are you? Thirty-eight. How long have you been separated from Barney? Ten, eleven years. How many other times have you been married? Twice. How was this before Barney, or after Barney? Once before and once after. Well, you haven't been married in the last five years then, have you? No. In other words, Mrs. Jenkins, you can't keep a husband, and now you can't even keep a daughter. -Is that right? -[Tyler yells] Objection. [Judge] Sustained. Don't do that, Mr. Adkins. Now, did you discuss sex over the telephone with George Gomez? -Yes... -And was this done in the presence of your daughter? Well, yes. Now tell me this. Were you on the premises, in the house, when they both said they had these intimate relations? -Well... -Well, just answer yes or no! -Yes or no? Yes or no? -[screams] Yes! Well, they... they said they did! Did George buy Linda's cheerleader uniform for her? Yes, he did. She didn't have the money to buy it, did she? No. Well, that's the reason I didn't want her to go into it. Why didn't you stop George from giving her all this money? Well, I tried to. I... I asked him not to give her any more money. Did he give her a lot of money? Well, yes. Yes, sir. Your testimony is that you never approved of these intimate relations between George and Linda. -Is that right? -No, I never approved of it. But you did talk to George about sex, didn't you? -Well... -And you did talk to Linda about sex, didn't you? Well, yes, she asked... [Adkins] And you tried to get George to marry Linda. -Didn't you? -No. -[Adkins] You didn't? -No! No further questions, Your Honor. Step down, please. Call your next witness. May it please the court, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defender rests her case. The state closes at this time, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Close the testimony. Excuse all the witnesses. We will now hear the arguments. Are you ready to proceed, gentlemen? May it please the court. [Judge] Mr. Tyler. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... on behalf of the defendant, Mrs. Ruby Jenkins, I want to thank you for your time and attention during this trial. This is the saddest, most tragic case that I have ever encountered in all my long years in court. Sad... because it concerns a budding and tender love, turned sour by premature consummation. Tragic... because it has wounded and scarred this loving mother, and crushed her beneath its irresistible power. She did the best she could. Tried everything she knew. But young love would have its way, just as it did with Romeo and Juliet. You know that these kids were desperately in love. That they had every opportunity to consummate that love, because Ruby Jenkins was out working, making a living for her daughter. You saw the tattoo on George's arm. You heard him say that he walked Linda home from school every day, and they were alone in that house. Oh, yes, they were married. Married in the eyes of God. Linda even filled out the matrimonial page in her Bible. It was in her own handwriting. Ruby Jenkins has nothing to do with it. And what about that date? April the 16th? The day these kids claim this absurd event took place. They admit they had intimate relations before Easter. And Easter was April the 14th. Two days earlier. Two days earlier. Now, why did this case ever come to court? In our modern, sex oriented society, young lovers sometimes have intimate relations. No matter how hard we try to prevent them, they get together. You know it, so do I. And what happens when their parents find out about their transgressions? Oh... They hush the whole matter up. That's what they do. And Ruby Jenkins did just that when she learned about George and Linda. She didn't want a soul to know about it. She didn't even file charges against George Gomez, because Linda said it would get in the newspapers, and her reputation would be ruined. Now, why wasn't this case hushed up? Just the way dozens of others are every day. I'll tell you why. Ruby Jenkins had a sister, who was full of prejudice and hate. She had a daughter, who was a temperamental, vengeful girl who would see her mother in jail rather than stop sneaking out on dates with George Gomez. Now, every daughter rebels against her mother somewhat. That's human nature. But Linda, goaded on by her spiteful aunt, brought shame and destruction to this mother. The same mother who brought her into the world, nursed her, and cared for her. Fed her, clothed her. Both mother and father to her. I am sure that you realize now what is going on here. This is no Perry Mason thriller that you are watching. This is the real thing. I am not going to recount these kids testimony. I'm not going to point out the obvious discrepancies and the lies in their stories. I'll just ask you this. Does it all sound believable? But these gentlemen over here say that you've got to believe that Ruby Jenkins proposed this incredible thing. Believable? It's preposterous. This mother is no different from any other. She faced the same problem that any mother of a 13-year-old daughter must face. She tried to instruct her daughter in the facts of life. Like everybody says, we must do. She tried to do this. She told her daughter she was too young to get married. She was too young for intimate relations. She even asked the preacher what do about these kids, they were getting too close. If there is anything this mother is guilty of, it is too much love. She took Linda back into her arms, knowing full well that she had transgressed, and done a terrible thing. She welcomed her back home. And she told her, "I'll stand by you. Keep away from this boy, George, and we'll start a new life." Even after today, she still wants her back home. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I place the liberty of Ruby Jenkins in your hands, and I know that your verdict will be quick, it will be just... and it will be "not guilty". Thank you. [audience murmuring] May it please the court. [Judge] Mr. Adkins. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure that not one of you in this courtroom is against young love. Certainly I'm not. Young love is a normal and beautiful emotion. But I submit to you... in spite of the emotional outbursts you've heard in this courtroom today, we are not dealing with emotion. We are dealing with the law. Now, you and I know that young love is blind. Therefore, it must be led. Now, this is not a case of vengeance by Linda Jenkins. This is a case against a mother who failed her daughter at the most crucial time in her young life. For in our society, it is the parent who is both morally and legally, mind you, legally responsible for guiding young love into the proper channels. Now, Ruby Jenkins made her first mistake when she let this Mexican boy into her house, Now, I don't mind telling you I don't like George Gomez, and he hasn't heard the last of this. Assisted... by this mother, George Gomez broke down the resistance of Linda Jenkins. She was violated. At the age of 13... she lost her status as a virgin. She lost the most valuable thing she'll ever have in her entire life. She lost the right to present herself to her husband as a virgin on her wedding night. Now... how much accountability... does a girl of 13 have? Fine. Only a couple of years ago, she was playing with dolls. And they... injected her into a situation of matrimony. And sex. And her mother sat by... talked to her about it, even encourage this act. And Linda Jenkins is under age. Under the age of consent. So what was this mother's motive? Well, she talked to a lot of people. She talked to George and to Linda, she talked to her preacher. Why, she even talked to her ex-husband. And what did she talk about? Was it really a fear that these kids were getting too close? No. Not fear. She talked about marriage. Surely to God, she wasn't trying to get rid of a 13-year-old daughter through marriage. But on the other hand... Linda was in junior high school. She was getting pretty expensive to her mother. Now I can't plead insanity for this woman. She hasn't pleaded it herself. But there's something wrong with this woman's mind. She's warped and twisted. She led her daughter to destruction. Made a mockery of motherhood. A mockery of motherhood. Now, what more bizarre and depraved set of facts can you imagine than this? Why, it isn't even human. Animals act like this, not people. And I submit to you... that her conduct warrants her confinement in the penitentiary. Now the purpose of criminal law is twofold. First, it's to punish the offender. But second, it's to keep others from becoming offenders... Now, we hear a lot today about delinquent teenagers. But I submit to you, in reality, these are disillusioned teenagers. Now, the church can teach the morality of right and wrong. The schools can teach the legality of right and wrong. And the Boy Scouts can set a good examples. But I tell you that one corrupt adult... can undo all of these good values by one bad word, or act. And so I ask that your verdict be guilty. And by that verdict, you say to all delinquent parents, who would push their children into crime and the gutter, that not only are they morally responsible, they are legally responsible. And they will be punished under the laws of this state, Thank you. It now becomes my duty... to read to you the charge under the law. "The defendant stands charged by indictment with the offense of rape of one, Linda Jenkins, alleged to have been committed in this county and state, on or about the 16th day of April. To this charge... the defendant has pleaded not guilty. When an offense is actually committed by one person, but other persons are present and they aid by acts, or encourage by words or gestures, those actually committing the unlawful act, such person, so aiding or encouraging are themselves principal offenders. And may be prosecuted as such. You are instructed that the rape of a female under the age of 18 years is constituted by proof that the sexual act occurred with a person or persons, not the husband of the said female. The elements of force, threats, and fraud, and consent have no bearing on this case. Now, therefore, if you should find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, that on or about the 16th day of April, George Gomez did then and there ravish and have carnal knowledge of Linda Jenkins, and that the defendant Ruby Jenkins was present, and did aid by acts, or encouraged by words or gestures, then you will find the defendant guilty of rape as charged. You will then assess the punishment of Ruby Jenkins at death. Or by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than five years. If you do not so find, and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, then you will find the defendant not guilty. You are charged that George Gomez was an accomplice, if any offense was committed. And you are instructed that you cannot find the defendant guilty upon his testimony alone. There must be other evidence in the case tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense charged. In all criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the state. You are the exclusive judges of the facts proved... of the credibility of the witnesses, and of the weight to be given to the testimony. But you are bound to receive the law from the court, which is here in given you and be governed thereby." All right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will retire to the jury room to consider your verdict. When you have reached your verdict, summon the bailiff. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have your verdict in this case? Will the defendant please rise? "We, the jury, find the defendant... guilty of rape." -[audience murmuring] -[screams] Oh, my God! -[sobbing] -[Judge] As part of the indictment... -[sobbing] -...and assess her punishment at 15 years confined in the penitentiary. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You are dismissed. Criminal district court is now adjourned. [loud chattering] [intense instrumental music playing] [music ends] Pretty stiff sentence, 15 years. Of course, you'll appeal the case. [Tyler] Ah... You know, a defense lawyer could win a lot more cases if the defendant could plead ignorance of the law. [Adkins] She may not have been as ignorant of the law as you think. You know, she gave a confession, then refused to sign. [Tyler] Yes, I know. But it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind. Why do you think she encouraged those kids the way she did? [Tyler] For the same damn reason that hundreds of similar mothers out there are trying to push their own daughters into marriage as soon as the kids reach puberty. [Adkins] But Ruby Jenkins went too far, legally. [Tyler] Maybe she did. [Tyler] But morally, she's no more guilty than anybody else in this society. And I don't think that Ruby Jenkins should go to the pen while they stay free. [orchestral music playing] [music ends]
