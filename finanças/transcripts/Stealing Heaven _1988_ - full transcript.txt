My Lady? She's asking for the crucifix. I understand. No. I don't understand. Sister Cecilia, you say all knowledge comes from God. All true knowledge. False knowledge is not knowledge. The devil can twist the truth. No, he can perhaps create falsehood. But I asked a perfectly reasonable question. I will not discuss it. Mankind presumably reproduces itself in the same way as the animal kingdom. Silence. God created man in his own image, that is true? Yes, that is in Holy Writ. Then, if man has organs of reproduction, it is logical to suppose that God also has... Blasphemy. Your argument is that, if God Almighty created man in his image, then God also must have certain parts of... It is an interesting theological point to which Holy Writ, to my knowledge, finds no answer. That is why I asked Sister Cecilia. She's my teacher, she should know. I would not have this child blaspheme. And Sister Cecilia told you, quite correctly in my opinion, that the private parts of God Almighty form no part of a lesson on the Holy Gospel according to Saint Mark. I shall speak to her most severely. Now, I must not keep you from your other pupils. Reverend Mother. Oh, child. My child. It is an enchanting question. I'm sure you think them up purely to annoy. Why do you have to make Sister Cecilia's life such purgatory? But she's such a... A fool. I know. But charity, child. Oh, well, she will only have to suffer for a few more days. Your uncle wants you back in Paris. Oh, Paris? Paris. When do I go? Reverend Mother, I shall miss you so much. I'm not long for this world and you have but two choices. To be the bride of man or the bride of Christ. And you have no calling for the church. Help me up. The Bishop of Paris will be returning from Rouen. He will pass this way in a few days and you can join his party. But if he speaks to you, please remember that education in women is frowned upon. And for you it could be very dangerous. So, my child, no discussions about the loins of the Creator! Marie, Marie, I'm leaving! I'm leaving! Oh, yes, my dear. I have something for you. Oh, what is it? Ah, my old mother made one for me. I made one for you. Burn it. If the smoke is sweet, he'll be true to you. But if it is bitter... No, it won't be, my dear. My dear. Reverend Mother. No. Bishop. Heloise. Your Grace. Charming. Charming. I know her uncle. Fulbert. He's a canon of my cathedral. He has many qualities. I'm so glad. Mostly those of an Andalusian horse dealer. Oh, I see. I understand he wishes her married. Knowing the dear canon, well married. She better ride with me. Goodbye, Reverend Mother. I'll remember you always. God bless you and keep you. The Gadarene swine, for instance. The Gadarene swine? But what's your difficulty my dear? It's all perfectly simple. Our Lord banished the evil spirit into the swine who then destroyed themselves. But what were the swine doing there in the first place? A pig was an unclean animal to the Jews. Who would they belong to? Um... Do you know, I haven't the slightest idea! Vice Chancellor, it was most considerate of the bishop to escort my niece. Remarkable work on the cathedral building fund. I congratulate you. His Grace is in your debt. I was owed favors, Vice Chancellor. Master Abelard is turning this place into a madhouse. He's too popular with this rabble. Indeed! He's turning the cathedral schools into a place of entertainment. Brilliant he may be... Brilliance has its place, but not adulation. Suger, why is there no work on the north tower? The masons, Your Grace, they are Flemish. Ah. Canon Fulbert, a most delightful child. Latin, Greek. She has the accomplishments of a man twice her age. Quite delightful. I shall come to dinner. It would be an honor, Your Grace. I trust... Greetings, Uncle. Well done. Well done, my child. Well done! Well done. The bishop is coming to dinner. Patience, my child. Patience. Agnes. Petronilla. Oh, Uncle. It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen. All my friends tell me I have a flair. Well, I hope it will suit until we have decided upon your future. My Lord sent me out to buy you some pretties. Naturally, as a canon of the church, I know little of such things. Notre Dame will be the finest cathedral ever. Maybe. But finding the money to match the city's aspirations will need some business tact. Aren't the merchants' intentions to show their aspirations to the glory of God? Oh, yes. And to the glory of the merchants. Master Poussin has arrived, my Lord. Excellent, I'll come at once. Perhaps you'll join me later on. Of course, Uncle. For a toe of the blessed St. Agatha? I couldn't let it go for under 200. No, no, of course you couldn't. Perhaps this would interest you. Some of the very straw upon which the Christ child lay in the manger. Would it be more or less? Surely, it would be hay. What? Hay. No animal would eat straw, it was a manger. Hay, yes, possibly hay. Oh, you know my niece and the bishop who greatly admires her intelligence were in deep discussion only today. Could you give me until today a week to decide? Of course, no trouble. On another matter, it's time my son was married. Perhaps you would consider an alliance. Well, we must certainly discuss it. You know, he is already squire to the Baron Rochais. Well, until next week then, Master Poussin. Man's practically a tradesman. If it takes him a week to think about buying a relic, then he certainly isn't in the market for you! I would have offered him the foreskin of our Lord, but he couldn't come near the price. I thought that was at St. Mark's in Venice. Yes, it is, that's true, yes, there is one there. Then how can it possibly... Oh, my dear child, these sacred relics can reproduce themselves, it's part of their miraculous nature. And if some of them are perhaps... Forgeries? Uh, replicas. Who am I to judge? Now, a peasant kneels down before one and prays. God hears his prayer and he gets up a better man. I don't... Thus we've done some good. Both for God and for man. Have we not? "Thou shalt not kill." And yet, in the book of Samuel, praise is heaped on two of Israel's greatest kings. For being men of peace? No. Saul has slain thousands and David ten thousands. But Israel was under attack. It was kill or be killed. I enter self defense! Not so! The commandment does not say, "Thou shalt not kill, except in self defense!" Yes! Yes! But the commandments are for the guidance of ordinary men. Kings are ordained by God himself. Therefore, they speak in God's name when a man is hanged or an enemy put to the sword. God speaks through them. And his bishops. Then when two Christian kings are at war, does God speak through both? One must be false. Are we to question the ways of God? Perhaps he wishes to punish both nations. Then why give the commandment in the first place? And now, consider this. He's a dangerous revolutionary. Arguments, disputations, is that any way to teach the established word of God? Meanwhile your lectures are half empty? Hmm? Senior members of the Convocation are ignored. I tell you, he's nothing more than a demagogue. He lives with his students, eats with them, drinks with them. If he wasn't a teacher, and therefore by custom chaste, I swear by heaven he would sleep with them. You are right, there are certain proprieties to be observed. There is much to lead one astray in this world. And towards hell in the next. Is it nobler to resist temptation or to avoid it? What is temptation? Temptation is finding the best looking whore in Paris, bending down to smell her flower. No, that's lust! Temptation would be if you had found a piece of silver in the gutter 30 seconds before. What is noble? To see who dropped the piece of silver and give it back. Is that avoiding temptation or resisting it? I'd call it stupidity. You, my dear Francois, would probably pocket the silver and jump on the whore anyway. That would be greed. Curfew! Curfew! By order of Vice Chancellor Suger! Curfew! You beast! You beast! Lady. Lady, be calm. You just dump that poor little boy and then you steal the money! I was collecting it. It would have been stolen in seconds. What are you going to do with it? Give it to his parents, of course. And where are they? They must be here somewhere. We can't just leave the body by the side of the road. But perhaps we can help. Thomas, tell them, I will not be teaching until noon. Go to each street and search for the parents. To touch these would be sacrilege. They will be quite safe. Come. I know who he is. I'll take him. One of Suger's men, wasn't it? They're like animals. Come, I'll take you home. Thank you. But I live just there. Then you are Heloise. The Gadarene swine would have belonged to the Romans. The bishop spoke of you. Who is he? Lady, you cannot have been in Paris long. That is the great teacher, Peter Abelard. Jourdain de Planissole, if I can ever be of service, ask any of the scholars. Thomas, you were born backwards. My Lord, you've never been with a woman in your life? You're a man like other men. When I was young, like you, I had girls by the dozen. Every experience in life was there to be savored to the full. Then I found my vocation as a philosopher. But, like other men, you accept tradition without logic. The unwritten law that teachers in the school remain celibate. For me it's much more personal. God, has entrusted me with a great gift. He has ordained that teaching is my life. For my part, I must carry my side of the bargain. If I were to take a woman, I would be flying in the face of my maker. Spitting in the face of God. Don't you understand? He would take away his gift. Damn me for all eternity. And he would be right. This is a terrible price. Too high for me. There's a girl down the street who can get me standing like a crocus. Crocus? That's a brute. ♪ Once I had glimpsed those twin peaks of her breasts ♪ Then could my passion-crazed soul find no rest ♪ Oft in my dreams I would fuel her desire ♪ Kissing, caressing to set her on fire ♪ At last releasing from sorrow increasing ♪ And travail unceasing I'll consummate bliss ♪ Sealed with a kiss, sealed with a kiss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Oh, that the end of my dreams could be this ♪ Sealed with a kiss, sealed with a kiss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Oh, that the end of my dream ♪ Could be this Stop this! As long as you have lodgings in this house, there'll be none of that. Ooh! And you think I want a woman? Yes, indeed, Madam, she's well educated. She speaks the Latin and, of course, has the Greek. Which she learned at the convent. The bishop, indeed, was most impressed with her. Now what about the settlement on her son, my great nephew? In any event, not until maturity. Or upon pledge of marriage? Very well. Two hundred cattle and pasture. With a dowry chest. Not less than 50 ells of linen. That's satisfactory. Oh, I'm sure we can come to terms. Here's Gaston. For you, Heloise! I'll teach you to hunt if you like. Please, Uncle, I beg you! Gaston, can't even read! And they all smell like sties! My dear, young Lamarck will inherit the title. Thirty two manors and an income of thousands. I beg, Uncle. In time your son, my great nephew, will be the baron. Please. They're almost as greedy as that damned convent. Oh, very well, little one. The thought of that lout bedding you is really too much. Shh! Shh! Where's the bed? Shh. I don't think this is very funny. Oh, don't be so pompous. It's just a joke. Master Abelard, your rent is due tomorrow. Then tomorrow you shall have your rent. If I pay you now, you would be in my debt, and I'm sure you would not want that. Shh! He's arrived. Is it more noble to resist temptation or to avoid it, my Lord? You must have cost those devils a pretty penny. Get dressed. No, not yet, my Lord. Come over here. How long did they pay you for? All night, my Lord. All night. Then I suggest we lie down. I bet he doesn't do it. I bet he does. A philosopher? Never. He said he wouldn't. He's made a contract with God. God doesn't have legs like that. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Pay up. Damnation, this is going to cost me a fortune! Right. Then let's go. No, she might make it yet. They told me I'd get another 20 pieces of silver if you mounted me. You shall have your money anyway. God, it's the watch! Out! Out! Out! Get out! Get out! You stink, Suger! Your Grace! This time he has gone too far. Lying with a common courtesan! Without, however, the expected result. Whose word have we for that? A woman of the streets. The wretches who hired her. He brings the schools, the city, Your Grace's person, all of us into disrepute! He challenges established knowledge! God's word from the mouth of a fornicator! I agree. His behavior ill becomes a teacher of these schools. But his success and his reputation brings acclaim to our cathedral. His fame brings visitors who bring trade, and he brings money to Paris. We will speak with him. You doubt my chastity? No, no, no. But I'm probably the only member of Convocation who doesn't. I know, they object to the way I teach. Certainly they do. They're jealous. Of course. And lack the sprit of the times. All this debating, why need your students speak at all? It's better for them to learn to cut their own meat than to be fed pap. Why should we... Enough! I won't have you disputing with me. I'm merely instructing you to mend your ways. And to begin with I intend to find you respectable lodgings, you agree? It's time you were bored a little. May I choose my own executioner? Welcome, Master Abelard. Welcome. The prioress wrote to me. She said there was nothing more she could teach the child. Never spent a more enjoyable journey. One didn't expect to discuss the Gadarene swine with your niece. I had an aunt once, ended up as an abbess at Caen. Brilliant woman. Looked like the back of a flat iron. Must have been 40 when I knew her. Dead now, of course. Must be. I hear you took her out to meet Lamarck's boy. Fine estates, rich, too! Oh, really? I thought we were to discuss my son. Preliminary discussion. With a mind like hers, I must consider these things. My son has Latin and Greek. And, of course, Lamarck only inherits a barony. There's plenty of time to think of marriage, isn't there, my dear? Well, of course, my child. Of course. The younger son of a duke, nothing less, I'd say. You're trespassing. On my thoughts. Why did you leave? I have a headache. That's the reason you gave, I asked the reason. I couldn't bear being talked of as a thing. Tell me what you like to read. Philosophy. Science. Mathematics. Astronomy. Theology? Some. Romances? No. Did you read this? It's probably as well. I was translating from Catullus, one of his more bawdy love poems. He would never talk of a woman as a thing. Good night, my Lord. Good night, Heloise. Well, I'm delighted you feel you can come and go as you please in my house. Good morning. Your niece has asked to borrow some of my books. Naturally, I agreed. Well, you're most kind, most generous. I wondered if you would like me to guide her studies. Oh, don't concern yourself with her accomplishments. Some wine? I mentioned the idea to the bishop. Really? And what was his opinion? He said it could only bring luster to your name. Oh, well, I certainly see no objection. None whatever. Please. Surely a law is a law! Who are we to pick and choose which we will obey? Because Holy Mother Church differentiates between... On whose authority? Where is such authority to be found in the New Testament? Our Lord said, "I come not to destroy but to fulfill." On the authority of the saints. How many saints did our Lord create? Our Lord picked apostles who... Have later have been made saints, except one. How do we know that Judas was not doing God's will? The God of the Old Testament is so different from our Lord. The old's a God of vengeance, the new, a God of love. How can one believe in both? Enough, enough, enough. Whatever God it is, I thank him that you're not in my public classes. I would rather argue with the Sacred College of Cardinals. No, I would rather argue with you than with anyone in the world. The College of Cardinals would be much easier. Have you read any of the classic poets? Have you? How do you define poetry? Surely it defines itself! No. Then it is memorable prose. A mirror held to truth, then written down. Good. Very good. I'll remember that. I've read your poems, too. Mirrors held to truth? No, memorable prose. Father, I've sinned. My mind has been filled with carnal lust. I'm not surprised, my son. You're not? She's one of the most beautiful creatures in Paris. To find her naked in your bed and sin only in the mind, I think you ought to be congratulated, not pardoned. But that's all behind you now. How's my friend the canon? You're not dead of boredom yet? No, my Lord, but badly wounded. He tells me you're a model of good behavior. Not before time. My penance, Father? What? Oh, yes. Four Paternosters, quite enough. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. It does matter. Leave me, for God's sake, leave. You're hurting me! Does temptation come from God? Or the devil? When did our Lord Christ tempt anyone? But God tempted Abraham. He put Job to the test. Again and again. How can anything evil come from God? It is impossible. It's a contradiction. Then who created the devil? Not our savior, whose birthday, if you had forgotten, is tomorrow. You owe me a kiss, my Lady. Christmas, it is the custom. Is it? Is it the custom, my Lord? It's practically the law. Master Abelard, good night. Heloise, I'm going to bed. Do you not owe me something, my Lord? It is the custom. It is practically the law. Our Lord was betrayed by a kiss. That was preordained. Is this? From the beginning of time. You smell of incense, like a church. It was a charm. All's well! Christ is born! All's well! Where have you been? Trying to make peace with my God. I've tried very hard to feel I've sinned. All through mass. All I can feel is happy. Yes. Yes. Then you feel it, too? It must never happen again. I was cold. So was I. Why? Why does it happen? I hear your voice every minute of the day. I see your face in the firelight. I... My love, I'm breaking every canon of the law. And every law of hospitality. So am I! I know, but it can't go on forever. Ah! Play on, Master Abelard, I expect no mercy and I give none. You're on check. I would have thought as a logician... No mercy. Huh? Done. Check. He likes to win, remember. Double check. Check. Check mate. Hmm? Masterly. Hmm, you are a man to be watched, my friend! Not now. What? Who said so? St. John, in his first epistle, states that God is love. One century before, Publilius Syrus claimed that a God could hardly love and be wise at the same time! Master Abelard? Your Grace. For weeks now, I have waited at the usual time for your confession, but in vain. How long must I wait? How long must He wait? I've been remiss, my Lord. It's been the busiest time of the year for school. Yes. Yes. Of course. Almighty God, my friend, see's all. He knows all. But now and again he likes to hear it from our own lips. Remember that. I will. God save Your Grace. A God can hardly love and be wise at the same time. A philosopher can hardly love and keep his vows at the same time! I have sinned, Father, I need absolution. Hmm, you wish for absolution? But are you prepared to repent of your sin? I'm a teacher, Father. What is your sin? Fornication. You find it difficult to repent of this sin? Yes, Father. Why? I love her, Father, with my mind, with my body, I have no sense of sin. You have allowed your emotions to corrupt the beliefs of your religion. But you know as well as I, that to absolve you is impossible unless you repent. Go, and peace be with you. Then in our eyes, yours and mine. I will never belong to another. Never. How can a God of love not forgive? How can he not look kindly on us? I've gone against His will and I've done it willingly and of my own choice. How can I fight your God when he is not mine? We are one always. Watch me catch a feather! You'll never catch one. Never! I will! I will! There! A dove's feather, it means love! This will be my own holy relic. And I proclaim this to be a holy day. Because I can never be happier than I am. Never. Ever. Uncle! I thought you were in Rouen. I changed my plans. Even for a piece of the True Cross, the asking price was a scandal. Where have you... The sun was so warm... We were studying St. Augustine, his confessions. Oh, I know them well. What part? His discourse on theft. You will remember he stole some pears. So we were walking in an orchard. So, my dear, what point did the good saint wish to make? He said, what he enjoyed was the sin of theft much more than the theft of the pears. Did I get that right, my Lord? Right, quite right! Very good. She's making remarkable progress. What are you doing? This one's getting worn. I thought you might give it to me. Why should I do that? We want to stay friends, don't we? Nonsense, Jourdain, this is part of your education. These plays are a Christian tradition. Daniel to the lion's den was thrown! To please the devil and the ravenous beast. Who'd tear his soul and body for a feast. But Daniel kept his soul for God alone! And so, sinless he holds the beast at bay. Yet should some sinful thoughts cross his soul, then I shall exact my just and rightful toll. Ha ha! And he is mine forever and a day. ♪ Once I kissed those twin peaks of her breasts ♪ Then could my passion-crazed soul find no rest ♪ Oft in my dreams, I would fuel her desire ♪ Kissing, caressing to set her on fire ♪ At last releasing from sorrow increasing ♪ And travail unceasing I'll consummate bliss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Oh, that the end of my dreams could be this ♪ Who can tell me the only one who can solve Master Abelard's stiffest problem? Only the wisest of the wise, Master Abelard's... Heloise! Even better one. Where does... My Lord, is it true? Go home, Jourdain. I have been no friend to you. I must say, child, I thought it a mistake correcting the Vice Chancellor's Greek! My lady. Jourdain? Jourdain, what has happened? There's a lot of talk. What about? Tell me. You and Master Abelard. They say he is your lover. Swear it isn't true. I can't do that. Then it is. Yes. You'll destroy each other, you know that, don't you? Monstrous, I... I should have known. Sharing a roof with a beautiful girl would give rise to such nonsense. It's entirely my fault. I should have realized. But... Not another word. My reputation is of little importance, but I cannot bring dishonor on her or your house. I shall leave in the morning. Now you can see yourself, my little poet, as I see you, every minute of the day. Surely this belongs to the Lady Heloise. She gave it to me. Gave it to you? Why would she do that? Jourdain! Please talk to him. Ask him to come here. Are you mad? Jourdain, please, you are my only friend. In the world, you are my only friend. You know it would be best if you never saw him again. Best? What is best? In body and soul, I ache for him. If there is a soul. Every inch of my body longs for his touch. Please, Jourdain. Thank you. He forced you! No! Don't try to protect him. He wormed his way into my house, then he seduced you! No! I love him! Don't use that word about him ever! Ever! My God! To think that I trusted that man. You trusted me! Soiled goods! But not unsalable. Some kind of marriage, but not at all what I wanted! I'm not a chattel! Oh, yes. By Christ, you are! In! The gate, you idiot! All I've worked for, all I've done, dragged down by... I don't give a sou. Your reputation is damned! I'd rather share his table as his whore than be supported by your ill-gotten pieces of silver! He's ruined you and he's ruined me! By God, this isn't the only blood that will flow. You can't keep her locked up there forever, my Lord. I don't see why not! And it's none of your concern! But she's been shut up for weeks. Get about your business, woman! Oh, poor pet! It must have been that fish last night. It's been the same thing every morning this week. When was your last flux? First week in Lent. That's 10 weeks. Let me see your breasts. By the saints, didn't no one tell you to use the rennet of a hare? What? You put it inside you and it curdles the man's seed. It might not be too late. I'm with child. His child. My dearest, I am carrying your child. And I fear my uncle. I must escape from Paris, but how can I avoid Suger and the watch? I may need your help. You there, there's a curfew. Burn Suger! Give me the effigy! I must go on with my teaching in Paris. The bishop supports me. I will come as soon as I can. Kiss my sister for me and give her these. Jeanne is not rich, and Le Pallet is not much of a place, but... If you were born there, I love it already. My Lord, Lady, the day goes on! The thing is done. But my name, my reputation! Anger can cloud a man's brain. I advise you to act with the greatest caution. Caution! I am ruined and you talk of caution! I do. Your name is sullied by your own act. And the affair has been compounded by you running about like a demented fowl squawking at whoever will listen. But Your Grace... Moreover, you may have lost your reputation. The schools of Paris are in danger of losing the greatest teacher in France! I pray that he will return to his duties. And I would look with the greatest disfavor on any act by you which would prevent that and thwart me! And if I were in your place I would not cross his students. They worship him! You must have changed my brother. It's you he now loves, not logic. This is from him. Claire, come and help. My lady, I'll be gone by first light. How can I thank you? Remember me. It's a fine son! What will you call him? Astralabe. Astralabe? That's no name for a Christian. He can be a Christian if he wishes. What's it mean? It's an instrument for measuring the distance to the stars. A way of measuring heaven. Why doesn't he come? Thank God. Not a word. Not a word. Let me look at you. Oh. Married? No. Never. I'm locked to you body and soul forever. But Fulbert can still send men-at-arms to drag you back. You are his chattel. You belong to him. Marry me willingly in the eyes of Holy Mother Church, you'll break that. Legally he can no longer touch you. Whatever Fulbert might think, I've done my best to make amends. That's how the world would see it. But not Fulbert! And what about your teaching? I admit there are some difficulties. The idea of a married philosopher is extraordinary. Unique, you mean. Oh, very well, unique. But what of it? It's only custom. A custom society demands! I have made my choice, Heloise. Now you must make yours. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. I want the man pilloried. But the cost! Damn the cost! I refer not so much to money as your own, personal reputation. You have been made to look somewhat foolish. Your own house, your own niece, under your own nose. And now you want to tell the world? And remember, if you had married her off to some decent young squire like my son... Damn you, that's past! I agree. Why not forget it and go about your business? Don't you worry. I'll look after him. Goodbye, little Astralabe, it's not for long! We'll be back before you know it. And then, what adventures we'll have. I know you hate Argenteuil, but I can't risk you in Paris. Not with your uncle and Suger. You'll be safe here. I'll come to see you often. Reverend Mother! Reverend Mother? Sister Cecilia? Yes. The old bat sold her soul to Suger. Our late Reverend Mother was barely cold before he made her prioress. I've arranged for your lodgings. Two months should be more than enough. Two months. My love, I must go. I can't very well stay here. Still less with you. Oh, I hate this place. I hate those clothes. Thank God I'm not a nun. It's not for long. They say that to love is to die a little. Oh, but not to love, that is to live in purgatory. Amo, I love. Amas, thou lovest. Amat, he loves. Amamus, we love. Amatis, you love. Amant, they love. Very good, once again. Amo, I love. Amas, thou lovest. Amat, he loves. Amamus, we love. Amatis, you love. Amant, they love. We want answers! Tell us the truth! My Lady! My Lady, there's a man. He's come to see you, he's in the refectory. Dear Christ, he's dead. No, Lady, no, he is not dead. And will not die. Then what? But he is hurt. Tell me. Tell me. They've done him an injury. How? They... They castrated him. No! Jourdain? I'm here, my Lady. It was my uncle, wasn't it? I don't know. I know it was. I understand your feelings, child, but we must accept the will of God and His justice. The will of God? There is no God! Child! I shall pray for you. Pray until your knees are raw. No one will hear but the spiders! I cannot have a blasphemer in my house. Don't worry. I will be gone by morning. Marie! Get me my clothes! It is the time of judgment. We are as one. It is the judgment of this holy council that Canon Fulbert be banished from Paris for the rest of his life! My Lord. My love. Go away. Let me be. Never. Go home. I am home. For the love of God, leave me alone. I want to die. You are not going to die. You're going to live and continue with your work. No. And I'm going to stay with you. I am an abomination. You're a man. And I love you. And I can never love you. It's God's just vengeance, I knew it would come. I spit on God and all his saints. When I heard of this thing, God died. Please leave me. This is more than I can bear. I will. I have something I must do. Then I will never leave you again. Marie. Yes, Lady. This place is a dung heap. Oh. You must die! You must die! It's Heloise. It's Heloise. Ah, fair niece. I have come to curse you. You! You who brought shame on my name and ruined me? You dared? I have been banished. Banished from Paris. Left with nothing. I'm ruined. You are left with life. And I pray it may be long and full of sickness and misery. I pray your eyes grow dim and your limb palsied. And I curse you in the name of every God that ever was or ever will be. And if you believe in a life hereafter, then I condemn you to the hottest fires of hell! God knows, I've been punished enough. All eternity is not long enough to punish you! Thank you, Marie.Oh. Heloise. Whatever you believe, I believe this punishment to be just. This thing may have shaken your faith in God, but it has confirmed mine. He is just. And I must make amends. I know what I must do. I'm going to become a monk. I'm going into the church. My love, you're in no fit state to make a decision. Maybe in a year, when... No. It is what I must do. And it's my wish you do the same. What? I said, I suggest you do the same. My sister will take good care of our child until he is grown. You selfish, self-centered swine. I'm your woman. We're part of each other forever. Please, I have to make peace with my God. It's no good. Nothing will shake him. You should have seen the size of the petition, thousands of signatures. All he says is that he'll think about joining a teaching order so that his students can still be with him. What will you do? Will you marry me? Hmm? Yours can be annulled. I won't expect you to love me, but I can give you a home and a name for you and your son. I'm going to inherit the estate and my father's title very soon. And I'd happy just to... Just to... I love you so very much. Jourdain. Sweet, dear, Jourdain, you know I can't. Bless you. I don't deserve such friendship. Sister. Where will you go? I own... Owned some land near Corbeil, I will build a community there and teach. You wish me to become a nun? I do. You are without family or friends. You must be somewhere safe where you can use your learning. I will do it. But it is you who has been crucified. You are my lord, I will love no other. In time... No. No other. But at least this way, I may see you now and then and touch your hand. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. I am unworthy, therefore I cannot kiss my lord. Father. My dearest Heloise, the building goes well, and more and more scholars join me here. They say I am teaching better than ever, and I believe them. I hear the word of God clearly now. Join me in thanksgiving, you who I made my partner both in guilt and grace. To me your praise is more dangerous because I welcome it. My dearest, I have heard from Le Pallet. Our son grows big and strong. Perhaps your sister Jeanne is a more natural mother than I. And, although I have little faith in the justice of the world, I hope and pray I may see him once more in this life. Sister! Sister, will you come to the prioress? What's the matter? The bishop's here. Suger. The Abbey St. Denis wishes to form another house and these buildings are needed. What is to become of us? There are other convents. I myself am going to St. Denis. As the abbess, no doubt. Those who cannot find a place will be absolved from their vows. Each of us must pray for individual guidance. But many are old and near death. We are all in the hands of God. ♪ Travail unceasing ♪ I'll consummate bliss ♪ Sealed with a kiss ♪ Sealed with a kiss Quickly, all of you. So, my Lord, I am in your bed again. I am glad you are. I'm sorry. We tried convent after convent. One sister died of the cold. I didn't know where else to go. You're home. Home. I am giving this place to you. Then it will be our home together. Now sleep, my love. My love. You still make love to me in my heart. What is it? I've been appointed abbot of St. Gildas in Brittany. By Bishop Suger? Mmm-hmm. Will they never let us be? Not in this life. I vowed obedience. Will I ever see you again? You will do me a great honor if you allowed me to consecrate the new chapel. If I live, it will take many years. Perhaps not, the way you work. It is Christmas eve, my lord. Do you not owe me something? It is the custom. Why yes, it's practically the law. Was all this preordained? Only the love! My Lord. My Lady. Noble indeed. Worthy even of you. Jourdain! I couldn't keep him away, I said there'd be feasting. Lady, I have taken this young squire into my service. I don't know why he has such an odd first name. His name is Astralabe. Bless you! Bless you! You are still the girl in the meadow chasing the feather. It is strange, isn't it? The one you love never seems to grow old. But we do, of course. We all have to return to the earth. A favor... If I can. Is it possible that I be buried here? Of course. And in God's time, perhaps you would share my bed. You'll never catch one. Never! I will! I will! There. You see? This will be my own holy relic. And I proclaim this to be a holy day. Because I can never be happier than I am. Never. Ever. My love, I'm here. I'm waiting.
