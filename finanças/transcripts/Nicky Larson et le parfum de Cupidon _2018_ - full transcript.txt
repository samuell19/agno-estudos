Remove your briefs, Mr. Mokori. Must I? I'm modest, you know. Will it hurt after? Relax, it's a minor op. I'm hyper-sensitive, with a very low pain threshold. I swear. Ouch, that hurts. Don't worry, Mr. Mokori. What's that? That goes in my body? It'll be alright. It hurts already. He's out, doctor. Let's begin. Sophie, compress. What is this? Bye-bye. Nicky? Nicky, get up! Wake up. A new mission! The code's on the board. Gel up or I'll drag you out of bed. Fine. You were warned. Laura, you keep out of my room. Seriously? I ran your bath! What if I'd had a girl here? As partners and roomies, we have to respect our vital space. Peeping again? You have a problem with women. Says you. Right! Sorry for reading. See the shrink. The perv with the porn pics? Alright... What do you see here? Breasts. Now? A butt. Naked archers. Sorry. My holiday photos... No idea why they're here. Move, she's waiting. Look at this mess. You'll pay for the punching ball. Why a sledgehammer and glue? That... I put up my new picture. Nice, huh? It's hideous. You needed all that? The Wall's rock-hard. Load-bearing... Change the music. It's like a call center! It's Mozart, ignoramus! Know if the client's cute? Very. Very cute. Nice try, the crab in the tub. Bravo! But it bombed. She arranged to meet here. Nice park. It's cool... Very nice. Excuse me. Can I play? Are you Ok, Laura? My brother loved soccer too. A year already. I know. Hold on... He's offside! What's this watch? To remember your name? From my sister, to make me punctual. I have to go. It's her birthday party. Big day tomorrow. I've found Black Hand. What? Black Hand. The Teope Cartel boss. Not that. Her party and I'm not invited? Introduce me. - You're a sex maniac. - Me? Look at this place! You hate the music? Hands off my sister. Promise you'll never touch her. I promise. If she looks like you, she's safe. Right, I'm going. Ranma... - A beer, please. - OK, Nicky. Sorry, but I... Tony! Who did this? Black Hand. Hang in there! Watch over Laura. Protect her. #Fitness Trail# What a jerk! Mr. Larson? Yes. Hello, Dominique Letellier. I left you the code. Seriously? He's your cute client? Cute clients don't pay. We need this job! Delighted. I'm Laura. I work with Nicky. Is what I hear true? You're the best bodyguard? The best cleaner? You can hit a spot six times? You fear no one? Nicky is everyone's last resort. Mr. Larson, have you felt an unrequited attraction? Let's make love. No. We are here to bring together Jeanne and Serge... No! It'll comfort you. No! It's Christmas soon. Put Baby Jesus in the crib. Are you mad? Maybe. I forget. Imagine it never happening again. Meaning? My father was a scientist. He never got over Mom leaving. Late in life, he created a love serum that makes the user irresistible. He called it "Cupid's Perfume". This odorless scent causes a surge of oxytocin. The attraction hormone. Contamination is shown by a red glow in the eye. The antidote is in the base. It's all in one big bottle, with a smaller, handier sample. Did he get her back? I'm afraid not. He was killed. For his invention. Sure he didn't invent booze? You're pretty far gone. I'm serious, Mr. Larson. You must eliminate the man trying to control the perfume. Imagine a terrorist group gelling it. Right. That'd suck. Mr. Larson... Are you nuts? You'll fall in love with me and forget women. Never. Bullshit. Bullshit? Please take your hand off mine, then. Bullshit. It's funny? Not that much! - It speeds up the effect. - Good. Laura... See that hunk? Let him sniff your neck. If he falls in love, I accept the job. Yeah? OK. I'll change sex too. For bigger? Very funny. You'll see how it works. Don't panic. It's only permanent after 48 hours. With the antidote... Hello, I'm Pancho. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. Maybe we could... Yes? Well, get up. You're right. Let's get up. My briefcase! The motorbike! Nicky, wait! I'm hyper-sensitive to pain... Why are you here? Hello. A minor accident. A stupid one. How are you? Hello, Larson. I know that voice... I guess your .357 Magnum is trained on me? And your Smith & Wesson wants to say hi? We're surrounded by innocents. Who is he? Falcon, aka Mammoth. A former guerrilla, now a cleaner. We've met before. Watch out! Let's begin. Sophie, compress. Bye-bye. For the insurance... See what I did? About time. And "thank you"? #Permanent gluteal cleft hair removal# Why not kill him? He's a mercenary. He can be replaced. We need to know who gave him the order and why. Mammoth won't talk. Your eye! What? There's a red dot. What? You've been infected. Give me the antidote. It's not my case! They were swapped. How long do I have? 47 hours. Then the effect is permanent. By the way, that's not the gear shift. I didn't do it on purpose! That's twice now. Yes, Linda? Can you cancel dinner? This is a big job. Thanks. Héléne, thanks for coming. I need a big favor. You must be in trouble if you need the police. I need the prints on this case. I have to find the owner fast. #...an explosive device in a trash can.# #I'm here with the town's mayor,# #Mr. Mokori.# #Hello.# #You were one of the first here.# #lndeed.# Seen that? We're on it. It's a miracle no one died. How long will it take? I'll do my best. I'll call you once I know. For this, I'll do anything you want. Put your pants back on. THE NUT HOUSE No, Héléne, not that door! Too bad I'm not smiling. You're crazy! I'm sick of you! What's that? No idea, ask the potter. Laura! Are you OK? I hate you. Want some ice? Look at the TV. It's that jerk again. I think I infected him. He knows your name? I found your wallet. What? He has our address too! Helene says the guy with our case lives near here. I hope Letellier destroys the perfume. Why? It's sick, forcing people lo love. The beauty of love lies in its uncertainty. If anyone needs that perfume, you do. You never bring a girl home. A girl? Are you serious? With the tomboy look and love of guns, you prefer briefs to garter belts. Rubbish. Excuse me, building... - C17. - It's that one. - Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome, sir. - Sir... - Cut it out. Good one. Sir... We get the antidote, the perfume, and head home. I freaked out a bit. Me, not attracted to women? That'd be hell. What's that? Stand aside. Are you OK? Who raided your place? No one. We were just tied up. Yeah, we're tied up. Is Gilbert Skippy here? Why d'you all want my husband? No idea where he is, he won't answer. He won't. You said "all"? Some bald bruiser wanted him and his case, but found nothing. He tied us up in a row, checked the computer and left. May I take a look? We want the case too. It was swapped for your husband's. Did he have it? Yes, last night. We were glad to see him, as usual. - Dad's home! - You were away? Three days, at a seminar. I'm back to celebrate my birthday. Clam up! I'm playing- Watch it, Jordan! You're getting my goat. Drop the medieval talk. It's not the 19th century. #And then,# he moaned about having the wrong case. No, shit! - It's not my case. - No one gives a shit! You're getting on my wick! Jordan, keep yelling and I'll tenderize your butt! What's this? #Did he change behavior# after opening it? He blew a fuse. He pounced on my mum, right? He pounced on your mum. Tell him! He pounced on me, right on me! I mean... I went to wish my darling son-in-law a happy birthday. Mom's back from vacation. Happy birthday, Didier! Thank you. Didier was her last husband. I'm Gilbert. For me? To mend it. What's wrong? Martine... I was miles away... I can't turn it off. I never noticed your green eyes. Know what they say? Nice eyes, big balls. What? No... No one says that. They've always been green. Let's see... It's off now... I can't reboot it. Yes... Can you mend my laptop? - Martine! - What? I see your knockers. I hadn't noticed! I'm so silly! Then he pounced on me. I fought him off. He kept saying he loved me. I even yelled at him. So, shall we mend it? Yes. Let's reboot! Martine... I'm stuck in the bed! What a jerk! He knocked me out. - I found Mom with her tits out. - Right. Bastard... Bastard. He ﬂew to Nice today. Can you unspool us? The tape. She was lying. See the red dot in her eye? I saw all the Jessica Fox photos. All signed "For Gilbert". She just posted this. She's doing a live video tonight from a lingerie show at the Monaco Grand Hotel. Monaco? Gilbert took a plane south. Laura... We have to go to this lingerie show. You're right. We need to hurry. Gilbert knows how the perfume works. Hello. Check-in is over. Are you really sure? For this ﬂight? Let me check. Thank you. I'm afraid that bottle has to go in a checked bag or they'll destroy it. Nice socks. Which? Yellow with red dots. Alright, you can board. Thank you. - I'm upgrading you. - Thank you. My number's in the glove box. If you have any questions, call me. I'm always free. That's kind. Toodle-oo. You can't stop, huh? It's preparation for tonight's gala. It helps me relax on a plane. Listen to Mozart and let me work. Give me that. From the gentleman... He insisted. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't believe it! What? That maniac's here! Can't I shake him off? Al least a guy's after you for once. Very funny. The sweater I got you. Sorry, I'll get cleaned up. The price it cost... Hello, it's Pancho. I'm too shy to say it to your face, but I keep thinking about you. Your eyes... Your mouth... Your thighs... I'm telling my dad! No, wait! Dad... I can't hear very well. I chose the wrong fuel. No, it won't start now. Can you hear me? Hi, can we help you? Thanks, girls. Just one more kilometer. No worries. Any plans for tonight? Sorry, I'm busy. Too bad, we're modeling at the Grand Hotel. Jessica Fox is the special guest. It'd have been fun. OK, I'll try my best. Awesome! Gilbert, Gilbert! Keep pushing, please. Sorry. Next time, maybe. #Little Kevin's family# #can find him at Gate A.# Hi, need a driver? Not anymore. We're going to Monaco. Why not join us later? Unless you're seeing your boyfriend. No more boyfriend. Sorry. It's OK, I left him. Been together long? Us? Us two? Not at all. This is my partner, almost a baby brother. Right, buddy? Stop! I'd never sleep with this sex fiend! You as well? NO Way! You piss me off! Wake up, you're drooling. What's this? Don't move, I'll check. Hurry back. How can she interest you? Vulgar, nymphomaniac... She's perfect. What's that? No... It's really high. Hold tight. Here's what I suggest. Free me from this magnet, we have a vegetarian dinner and I make love to you. I gave you a truth serum, so let's not waste time. Where's the perfume? You OK, Teddy? Shit, you got hit? It stings. Get as mad as you want. No one can resist this serum. Where's the perfume? It's with... Gilbert Skippy. He'll be at the Monaco Grand tonight. Shit! That's better. What does Gilbert Skippy look like? In my pocket... Shit! The other pocket. Release me now and I'll spare you. You'd need to deal with my men first. They're all ready to die for me. I'm not too keen. I don't want to, like. We'll see about that later. Put him in the crusher. I guess the truth serum works. - Anything else to tell us? - Sure. Go on, make us laugh. I'm a mole. Seriously? That's why you were away when the cops came! No, I was with your sis. What? You're dating her? No,honestly, it was just a quick fuck. - What? - Holy shit. - Is she hot? - No, but she never says no. All back off. No sudden moves. Calm down! Waste him! - Madam Laura? - Yes. It's Pancho, I got a cab. Pancho! Good to see you for once. Let me out. No sweat. Where are you? In the trunk! Stupid... Thanks. Freeze! Bye-bye, Larson. I'm sorry. What happened? I aimed well. Nicky, are you OK? You're in pain? What is it? Tony's killers? The Teope Cartel, yes. My brother and I spent our summers by the sea with Dad. My bike got stolen one day. Tony promised to get it back. A week later, he came home with a black eye... and my bike. He told me... I need to pee. Do you have to interrupt? Sorry. You know, I lost someone close too. A Year ago. His name was Arthur. My dwarf hamster. #One day, he was trembling# #after his bath.# It'll be OK. #I tried to warm him up.# There. Hiya! No! The medics couldn't help. I really need to pee. Can we stop? You're forgetting me! Stop following me! Good evening. The models invited me. Sorry, this isn't the Macumba. You're 30 years late. If we let you in, we close. That takes the biscuit. I'm on the list. Benny Hill... No, no Benny Hill. Jerry Lewis? I'm afraid not. Have a good evening. Goodbye. Miss Fox! Jessica! Ooh. Oh, boy! This is... This is a Fan. Can I take a photo? Of course. You so messy. You want to come to my room to facing up. I don't speak English. OK Follow me. How's your butt? You just grazed me. I'm ready. Don't laugh, OK! There. - Gorgeous. - Don't start. It's true. I can't lie with the truth serum. Yeah? Is it reliable? 'Fraid so. Ever lied to me? Yes. OK, great. About what? About guns. I'm not scared for you. It's to keep your hands clean. The blood never washes off. I forgive you. I lied about your sweater too. Meaning? A call girl left it. What? Let's hurry. Jessica Fox will lead to Skippy. Anyone there? Yes. Nicky and Laura. Why're you here? We need the bathroom. No, we wanted to break in. Sorry, he talks rubbish when he drinks. We'll be going. Sorry. You wanted to break in? Rather than beat you up, see. You? Beat us up? And how? Grab your tie, taser your pals, then ﬂip you. And ram you in a bush. Get lost. Bye, musclemen. #A shadow slips through the night# #it's a killer taking ﬂight# #Like a demon, he grins# #Never punished for his sins# Let's split up to find them. OK. #Dominique Letellier...# Hiya. It's me. How are you? #Fine, thank you.# I called to say it's going well. We'll soon recover the perfume. #That's great.# There you go... #Anything else?# Yes. I wondered, on the off chance, once the job is over, do you fancy going for a drink to debrief and get acquainted? We barely know each other. #Can we talk later?# #I'm with a friend.# A lady friend? #Well, more than a friend.# Don't bother calling me back. Have fun! #He comforts me# #Weekend in Rome# Gilbert, tonight's the night! Not answering my messages now? Look what you're missing. That's it. My jacket's clean. Beautiful. Something to drink? Near beer? No. Your French is great. Thanks. I love France. I love its history. I love Napoleon. Louis XIV. Maitre Gims. Maitre Gims? Forgive me. Drink makes me a bit... Jokey? No... Slutty. And you? Any passions? Sudoku. Sodoku? A game in magazines. Never played? No. I can teach you. OK, sodoku. But the loser gets a forfeit. Alright? Right on, cuz. Who goes there? - Sorry? - Fashion Police. Tonight's theme. I'm an inspector. Try our lie detector. I'm busy. It's fun, the star attraction! Alright. Let's see. If you're innocent, I'll let you go. Put your hand here. - Your first name? - Laura. Married? No. With someone? No. In love? No. No, I'm not in love. I know... Is he here? No. Not at all. This thing is crap! The secret service uses it. Sure. Auntie Brigitte turns me on. It does work. Black Hand's men are here. Let's blend in. Dance with me. They're everywhere. Are you listening? Yes. Follow me. It's dangerous. Wait by the truck till I get the perfume. I have a key to Jessica's room. Skippy's bound to be there. See you soon. No! No! Stop! There you are! You know you forgot me? We did? Can we talk later? I'm a bit caught up. What happened? I'm hanging here! Call the elevator! Stuck. So go fetch it! Good idea. Pancho? Thank you. Sorry, I got the wrong ﬂoor. It's OK, I have your dress! Good evening. I preferred last year’s collection. Great... You're good at it. Sure about the forfeit? Come on, it'll be fun! There. Dance for me. Right... Right now? OK, here goes. Sexier... My own cop... Make it sexier for me. Look who's there! Jesus, what a hunk! He's so sexy. You said it. That mustache. What a turn-on! A Chippendale. Fantastic! Sorry! Forgive me, Jessica. I'm really sorry. Wait, I feel uneasy. I have to tell you... Hello. #Jess, it's time to go out live!# Oh No! Oh No. I'm... Can we postpone? #No, you have 7 million fans waiting!# OK, ok. Give me a minute. I have to confess something. Tell me later. I don't want you to run away. Here i am Hello everybody. I'm so happy you could be with me tonight. He's with Jessica Fox! The bitch! We have to step in, girls. What can we do? That what glamour about. Be Movie Star. And I love... Jessica? Hi, everybody. #Hi, Celine 58.# #I'm Gilbert.# #She isn't dead.# #She's breathing.# That's Bébert! What's that slut doing? #I grew up in Gueret in central France# #and in 2007...# Champion, Dad. Stop following me, OK? I'm sick of this guy. Where's the damn antidote? What are you doing? Laura, since my dwarf hamster, I haven't felt this for anyone. Like him, you went "boom". You, in my loving heart. Him, in my oven. Stop... You're not in love with me. A perfume infected you. That's the worst excuse ever. Just say you don't want me. I don't want you! I'd rather die. Drive over me! That's dumb. You're under the wrong wheels. OK, I was bluffing. Goodbye, Laura. That's sweet, Lisa 31 and Amadou in Cote d'Ivoire. Kisses to you too. What's this? Room service? The perfume. What? Where is it? Chill, Bill. I don't know. Where's the perfume? In my pants, in the bathroom. Sorry, I shouldn't have taken it. #I saw its power when my mom-in-law# #showed me her jugs.# #She wanted to screw,# #with her daughter in the next room.# #And my wife's horrible too.# #She sugars her mom's coffee# #when she's diabetic.# #Just to inherit sooner.# #And my son...# #He's not ours.# #We found him abandoned# #in a rest area lavatory.# #We wanted a dog,# #but got Jordan.# You bastards! You never let me have a dog! Don't start! It's not this. The big bottle with the antidote? An antidote? What's going on? He's mugging him! - Busy! - Watch out! Hello. Gilbert! Jesus! That's them. - It's them. - Get in the car! Shit! The gate! Drive. DRIVING SCHOOL I can't! We're here! Catch them! I've got the jitters! Stick close! Stop! Motherfucker! Got it! #Soothe the pain where it hurts# It's burning! - Do something! - Fire! Take the wheel! Turn it! You did it! Look out! Where is he? Pancho! - Where's the perfume? - At my hotel. Where? Just outside Monaco. I'll be OK. That's kind. Pancho, are you OK? No, I'm not. Why don't you want me? I know where the antidote is! I get it. You're together. Not really. What does that mean? We just work together. You think you're my type? No. There's no problem. Exactly. No problem. We can't be together. Why? I'm straight. You bastard. I was kidding. You know you're exceptional. You could hook any guy. It's true. Awesome. What? The serum's worn off. I can lie. I'll get him and we go. - Where are you going? - Away from you! #Ok, dinner when you get back.# Why wait? I think I've changed my mind. Sorry? My life could be with him. We're not the same age, but I don't care... What was that? Are you nuts? I'm like before? I'm like before! So the perfume really works? You bet. Laura, I took the antidote. #Nicky, I'm really sorry.# #You found the bottle?# #Great news.# #Bring it to the old nuclear plant# #or she sees her brother again.# I've found the perfume. Who hired you? Who's on the line? It wasn't me. Let me go home. #Mammoth?# #Can you hear me?# #Got the perfume?# We need to talk. This is important. Listen to me carefully. I was hired by... #Calling all units.# #Hold-up near the harbor.# Shit! #SCALA & BROS# #GUNSMITHS# It's dangerous. Let's turn back. I'm in a blue funk. Why come then? It's my fault. And I need the antidote. Even with a head like a dick, you can have balls. Nicky took out the guards. #We'll surprise them.# #We're one step ahead for now.# - Are you OK? - You came. You have our keys. Look, I got the perfume. - I took the antidote. - Great! Sorry if I hurt your feelings. I care about you. You're more than just my partner. You're my best friend. Let's go. I'm glad you're like before. Me too. I've fallen in love again. Really? It's an impossible love. - Why? - She tried to kill me. - Who? - The taxi girl. The boobs on her... Bazookas! OK, let's get going. What's that? No idea. What is it? I wouldn't touch it. The Belt's hooked to her pulse. If she removes it or leaves the building, the belt will explode. I alone know the code to defuse it. Drop your guns. The bag and the riﬂe too. Give us the perfume and no one gets hurt. My God, they're trapped. No one touches Laura. No blood on my hands? I told Tony I'd protect you. Why're you here? To help. We sweated buckets. No! It's over. Give us the code. I'll send it. Right away. What's up? We won. It's great. He alone knew the belt's code. Come with me. The kiss of life. 1, 2, 3... Blow! 1, 2, 3... Blow! Why won't it work? - What now? - This way! I'm not keen on this. Trust me. Mr. Pancho? Come on, Gilbert. Go, Guingamp! I've found a car. Cool. Get out! I can't go further. If I remove it, it won't feel my pulse. - What? - I'm removing it. - No, stop! - Trust me! Once it's off, we run to get out of its range. - Ready? - I don't know. All set. Go! Nicky... Why did you do it? Open the door. Open it. Open it! I forbid you to leave me! Open this door! Nicky, please... I'm sorry. It's all my fault. He sent this before dying. #If I don't make it,# #tell Laura I'll watch over her.# That's kind, thanks. The perfume... Destroy it. Nicky died for it. I'll think about it. How did you dare to hire Nicky? I knew he wanted revenge. With Mammoth after the perfume, I could get rid of both if they killed each other. You're putting me in a very awkward position. If only you knew. Wait for my order. No one opens fire yet. Can anyone hit Black Hand? No clear angle. Who fired? I told you to wait. #No idea.# It wasn't us. Pleased to meet you after all this time. Who are you? Héléne. My name's Héléne. Take him in. Move it. Get in there. To think I believed in you. Larson? Who told you? An old friend. #Hello?# #Mammoth?# Impossible. #Do you have the perfume?# #Dominique Letellier is a woman.# You're an imposter. She hired Mammoth to get the perfume you killed for. #On learning that,# #Mammoth helped me.# #I faked my death.# #With me alive,# #you'd never have confessed.# Shit! Hello. Thank you for helping. I'm glad you took the antidote. Yeah... I wish it'd been sooner. Why? WOW! I'm sorry. Know what? I'll buy you a drink one evening. Yes. I'd love that, miss. When? Soon. I'm Dominique Letellier. Here's what you wanted. The last drop of perfume in a glass ball. Love and science don't mix. Thank you so much. Isn't it hard abandoning your father's invention? I have no choice. It wasn't 100% reliable. What? I saw someone infected and he didn't change. So he already loved the one who infected him. Ready? Yes. Here you go. Against your shoulder. Hands here. Hold it like this. There. The riﬂe mustn't move. Careful. The scope now. Breathe slowly. Feel your heart beat. Don't get too close. I'm that desperate? Once you feel it, shoot For Tony. Are you OK? I don't know. That T-shirt really suits you. Shit... It's true. It goes with your eyes. Oh, shit... Know what they say? Nice eyes, big balls. Shit! Shit!! A double sanction. Shit... Need a hand? What? Do you need a hand? She's right there. It's the Wind's fault. Like I'm stupid! I'm sick of it! Come here! Calm down! Not a hammer. You piss me off!
