The man is dead. Walt. Walt! What happened? Tell Paul Madvig. He'll get me out of it. Okay. Pardon me, sir. Yes? Is Mr Madvig downstairs? You'd better ask Ed Beaumont. Thank you, sir. Mr Beaumont. Just a minute, Midnight. Come on. Come on boy. Evens. Odds. Six times in a row and you can't fix that fan. I tried it myself yesterday. What is it, Midnight? A gentleman to see Mr Madvig, sir. Okay, I'll talk to him. Sixty bucks in ten minutes. Call it once for twenty bucks. Evens. Four. Pay George. Hiya, Sloss. Listen, Ed. I got to see Paul right away. He is upstairs. I want you to pick up those posters and post them in the river district. We've passed up hundreds of votes there. - Okay, Paul. Take a cigar with you, Hughie. - Thanks. Go on, take some. - Oh, thanks. Well, you better get going, Hughie. - You betcha. [ Telephone ] Hello? What? No, I don't want to talk to any reporters. Hi, Ed. If anybody else calls tell them I left. Hi, Sloss. Well, what is it? - His brother-in-law. Walt Ivans? Yeah. He smacked into a guy with his car and killed him. Drunk again, eh? His car got out of control. - Oh, sure it did. I tell Walt he can't drink so he drinks. Okay. There is nothing I can do about it. Can't you call up? - Call up who, and for what? But I thought .. Yeah, you thought. Paul Madvig. Paul Madvig. That's all you guys think about. Well, this is once too often. - But Paul .. I'm sorry, Sloss. I can't do a thing. It's too near the election. Alright, Paul. If that's the way you feel about it. They got no brains. None of them. They've got votes. Well the women's clubs and our .. Our reform gang. They've got votes too. That never used to worry you. Ed. Give me the once-over. Big night at the Senator's, huh? How did you guess? Fix this. - Sure. You really going to back the Senator, Paul? And those reformers? - Yeah. Why? You tell me. Because he needs us. And we need him. To put over the whole ticket. Could he make it without you? - No. Not a chance. Say, Ed. Are these socks alright? Not unless you black up the Christmas trees. Then you couldn't see them. That's the idea. Aren't you kinda particular? Maybe. So is the Senator. Yeah. I suppose. You know, Ed. We've gone a long way from the old 8th Ward. Uhuh. Maybe too far. [ Door knocks ] Come in. The printer left this layout. He wants your okay tomorrow. - Oh, thanks. Say, Clarkie. Go down and get a pair of plain, black, silk socks size 12. And hurry. Yeah. Say Ed, just a minute. - Yeah? Take one. - What? Take a card. Oh. Now don't let me look at it. Ace of Clubs. Get those socks. Size 12. I can't understand it. It said in the book that if you keep top cards .. How is that? I wouldn't like if it was good. Ah, you're prejudiced, that's all. You think the Senator will play ball after the election? I'll handle him. He's practically given me the key to his house. Yeah? A glass key. Look out it don't break off in your hand. Don't worry. Say. How far has his daughter got her hooks into you? Ed. I'm going to marry Miss Henry. Huh? You got that in writing? Nobody knows about it yet, but .. Except you and me. I won't brag about it. But you'd better get her signed, sealed and delivered before election. Now wait a minute. Miss Henry is a lady. She is absolutely on the level. Sure. And the level she is on is way over your head. She thinks. Ed, I don't know what gets into you sometimes. You got a pin? How does the .. how does the coat fit? Swell. The Senator will probably let you shake hands with his butler. Why, you .. Size 12. Oh, Ed. - What? Look. Placing the lighted cigarette in the pocket. And then pulling the pocket out to show that it is empty. How's that? - Swell. You said it. Get me Bernie. Hello, Bernie? This is Ed. Is it raining at the track? Okay. Third race tomorrow. Goal Decision. Three hundred on the nose. Right. Sorry sir, but Mr Madvig is going out for the evening. I don't care where he's going. Tell him Shad O'Rory wants to see him. Yes, Mr O'Rory, but .. - Shut it. Hiya, Beaumont. How are you, Shad? - Fine, Paul. How is yourself? - Alright. Well? I want to know where I stand. With who? - With you. I hear the order to close up my places came straight from you. What do you think of that, Ed? I am buying my way and want it. I said I was cleaning up this town and that goes for you too. It's going to mean killing, Paul. If you make it mean killing. I'm too big to take the boot from you. Maybe you're too big to take it lying down but you'll take it. You are taking it. Oh, no I'm not. The Four Leafed Clover reopens tonight. Bother me and I'll bother you. Give me Rainey. Oh, Rainey. Yeah. Fine. How are the folks? That's good. I hear Shad is going to open the Four Leafed Clover again tonight. Slam it down so hard it bounces. Sure. Fine. Goodbye. Now you know where you stand. I see. Thanks. Well? Wrong, Paul. Don't anything ever suit you? This hat is alright. You think I should have backed down? No. But you should have left him an out. Now he's got to fight and it's only three weeks to the election. I've been running this town for ten years. I'm going to keep on running it. Is .. Is this right? Perfect. I'm getting on with her. The big idea is not to be too .. - Conspicuous. Yeah. I got you. Your gloves, sir. Thank you, Beddows. - Not at all, sir. Like it? I don't know. I didn't hear it. Well, that is not very complimentary. Or if it is, it is almost embarrassing. You mean that I am embarrassing? You are pretty direct. And you don't like that? Father says it is one of your finest qualities. Isn't that right, father? - What, Janet? I was just telling Mr Madvig how much you appreciate him. Oh, Paul knows that. Hello, Taylor. Mr Madvig, you know my brother? Yes. Quite well. May I see you a moment, Janet? Yes, certainly. You will excuse us? - Surely. Do we have to invite him here? Uhuh. Until after the election. - Ha. Is that all you wanted of me? Well, I am a little short again. Oh. I have about $80. Will that do you any good? Where is it? - Upstairs in a brown bag. Thanks, Jan. Taylor. Taylor. Were you trying to borrow money from Janet again? No. Aren't you staying for dinner? - No. Where are you going? - Out. Well, aren't you being very exclusive? Well .. I didn't mean to be. Old Madvig's daughter is out there and she's looking for him. I'll see her in a second. Hello, Snip. - Where is father? He's slumming. Over at the Senator's. Anything important? No. Something I can do? I .. I've got to have 300 dollars right away. Doing your Christmas shopping early? I'll pay you back next week. Thanks, Ed. Okay, Opal. Midnight. Bring me my hat and coat. Yes, sir. Never mind. Taxi! [ Door knocks ] Come in. Did you get it? Thanks, baby. I tried to call you yesterday. Hello? Mr O'Rory please. Hello, Shad? Say listen, I've got 300 of that. How about the rest of it? Listen, give me a couple more days will you? Yeah. Okay, Shad. Okay. Hello, Opal. Ed. What do you want? Come on. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Come on, get into these. - Who do you think you are? I'm a pretty good friend of Paul Madvig's. Come on, Snip. I'm not going. Taylor, stop him. Now look here, you can't tell her what to do or what not to do. Here is the key to your car. Thanks. Goodnight. - I'm coming in. If you think you can stop me from seeing him you're crazy. You think you run this town, you and father. Well, you are not running me. So you're really that stuck on Taylor Henry? What's all the fireworks? What was that stuff about Taylor Henry? Have you been seeing him again? No, I just happened to mention him. You don't have to cover up for me. Yes, I did see him. After what I said? Where were they? No place. Forget it. Where were you with Taylor Henry? I was in his apartment. You were what? Go on. Tell him everything, Ed. You are his yes-man. I want to know from you. You think what you like. You will anyway. Take it easy, Paul. - Never mind. Where you going? - Back to the Senator's. I'm going to break this thing up. Hello, Ed. Rye. How you doing with the ponies? Yeah. Goodnight, Ed. - Yeah. I thought you went home. Did you see the Senator? Yeah. Got everything settled? In a way. Was Taylor there? He came in later. Why? He is laying in the gutter up the street. He's dead. Is that so? Don't you understand what I'm saying? Somebody killed him. You want me to get hysterical about it? Shall I call the police? No. Don't they know it? There was nobody there when I found him. I wanted to see you before I did anything. Is it alright for me to call them? Why not? You are a big fool, Ed. One of us is. Wait a minute. I know just where we can use this. Okay, Shad. That story will bust this town wide open. I don't believe it. - Me neither. Not Paul Madvig. What do you think of that? - No. Old Madvig is everybody's friend. Why, he wouldn't hurt a fly. That's just politics. - Sure. The town couldn't get along without Paul. Is Shad behind this? What do you think? I don't get the tie-up. The editor of this rag is in hock to Shad body and soul. Who is feeding them the dirt? - I don't know. But somebody is talking out of turn. Two of hearts? That's right. That's very strange. Alright. Have him come in. - Very good, sir. No. You had better stay, Janet. How are you, Senator? - Mr O'Rory. My daughter. How do you do, Miss Henry. - How do you do. Won't you sit down. Well, it is rather a personal matter. If Miss Henry doesn't mind .. - I'd like her to stay. Whatever you like. I am very sorry about Taylor. He was a good friend of mine. A nice boy. Thank you. Senator. You probably realize that politically it doesn't look very good for you. Really? Why? Your tie-up with Paul Madvig. You must know what the whole town thinks about Paul and your son. Paul Madvig is a friend of mine. A friend of my family. He closed your gambling places. The editor of The Observer is a friend of yours. The connection is quite obvious. The Observer has evidence. And it isn't going to quit until the case against Paul Madvig is complete. That is impossible. Why not be practical, Senator? If you stick with Madvig. You haven't got a chance. Why don't you cut loose from him? The Observer will get behind you. And I'll use all my influence. Thank you, Mr O'Rory. But I can't do it. And you are wrong about Paul. I see. Well. If you should change your mind, Senator .. I won't. Ridiculous. He's right. Everything he said is right. You have done nothing about Taylor. Why? Because you're only interested in one thing: being elected. And that won't happen if you stick with Paul Madvig. Janet. - He killed Taylor. You know he did. No. Mr Madvig is not at home. No. This is his mother speaking. Yes, I will tell him. [ Buzzer ] Why, Ed. Hi, Angel. You're a wicked boy neglecting an old woman this way. You are worse than that Airedale Paul used to have. I am part Airedale. Oh Mom, is Opal home? Yes. She is upstairs. She hasn't been down all day, poor child. What's the matter? I don't know. Nerves, I suppose. And no wonder. Ed. Paul didn't kill that young whipper-snapper, did he? No, Mom. I knew he didn't. Paul has always been a good boy. His mother is not bad. Say, Mom. The circus is in town Friday. Is that an invitation? - Nope. It's a date. Alright. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Hello, Snip. Hello, Ed. I know, kid. Who do you think could have done it to him? I don't know. Ed .. do you know what happened that night? After father left here. No. I didn't go with him. Why did you talk to father before you telephoned the police? Snip. Has anyone been asking you questions? I haven't seen anyone. Did father do it? Snip. Because if he did I would talk. I'd tell everything I know. Did you really love Taylor that much? I'm sorry. I guess that was kind of dumb of me. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Opal. Miss Henry, Janet Henry, is on the phone and wants to speak to you. To me? - You'd better not get up. Tell her she is not in. Alright. If she calls again, don't talk to her. You understand? Keep away from her. "Paul Madvig threatened with indictment." "Paper! Get the extra paper." "Paul Madvig threatened with indictment." "Extra! Read all about it." Yes I know, Ed. But look at the spot that I'm in. Of course I know that Paul didn't kill him. But if I have to go before the Grand Jury, why .. I have to, that's all. And if The Observer keeps on hammering. What else can I do? Alright, Farr. Thanks, anyway. Hiya, Tim. - Hi, Ed. Hello, Ed. Well, I got this paving contract straightened out. That's good. Silk socks don't go with tweed. I like the feel of silk. Then lay off tweed. Did you get a load of this indictment story? Oh, that's a joke. - Yeah? I'm not laughing. Why, you couldn't find twelve men in this town to indict Paul Madvig. Farr knows I don't go in for murder. Besides, what evidence have they got? You don't know what Shad's got. Nothing. When does the Grand Jury meet? - Two weeks from Monday. Alright, let's worry about it two weeks from Tuesday. And don't tell me I'm wrong. Why don't you let Shad open up again? He's spreading all the dirt. No. He's going to take it and like it. Get smart, Paul. Lay off him for a while. No, no. This town isn't big enough for the two of us. And I am staying. Now, you take that and like it. Alright. You're the boss. Hi, Ed. - Hello. Hey, Ed. Did you talk to Paul about the playground stuff? No, Go talk to him yourself. Maybe he'll listen to you. Hello, Clarkie. Hi boss. Say, what's the matter with Ed? - Why? He looks sore. - Well, you know Ed. He'll cool off in a couple of hours. Look, Clarkie. Did you send those orchids to Miss Henry? Yeah. You know the guy only had 18. You didn't send her eighteen orchids? Don't worry. I made them put in some roses. You're not throwing these away? Send them down for the papoose. Thank you, Mr Beaumont. Here. Keep your pants up. Gee, thanks. Okay son. Anything else I can do for you? Yes. You can give me a bicycle. Wouldn't you rather have a motorcycle? What kind? Give me those suspenders. Hello young fellow. How you doing? - Pretty good. Mr Beaumont is going to buy me a motorcycle. Francis. Well, he is. - I know. Going places? - I might as well. New York? - Just places. You going for good? I'm leaving here for good. I got to pick up my watch. You want to come along? This is a fine time to be throwing me down. What's got into you? I'm just tired of hick-town stuff. Meaning me, I suppose? You are hard to get along with. I never said I wasn't. How about a drink? Could you use one? In there? That's one of Shad's places. That's right. Hiya, Ed. - Hi, Paul. Hi. Beer. Rye. - Yes, sir. You don't think much of me as a big-time politician, do you Ed? Figure it out for yourself. I've done alright. I don't think I'm any Napoleon but I've come a long way from the old 8th. Yes, you have. What do you want me to do? Write a note of apology to Shad and tell him all is forgiven? Not a bad idea. All I know is, when you got somebody in a corner, go in and finish them. Say, why are you sticking up for Shad? I'm not. But everybody is outsmarting you. That's all. Who is outsmarting me? Come on, you started something. You might as well finish it. Do I owe you anything? I've always held up my end, haven't I? And I'm checking out. That's all. Wait a minute. You can't do that to me. Why can't I? Hello, Duke. He did? Look. Get Beaumont over here right way before he cools off. Tell him anything and step on it. Alright, Shad. Hello, Hinkle. - Hi, Duke. Glad you came, Beaumont. And thanks for trying to talk some sense into Paul. I thought he was wrong. He'll know he was wrong before I get through. I want to get one thing straight. Is the split between you and Paul for good? You sent for me, didn't you? Yeah. I came, didn't I? Okay. Sit down. Thanks. Got any plans? Got a ticket to New York. You can do yourself some good right here. How? You ought to know plenty about Paul Madvig. What is your proposition? Why did Paul bump off young Henry? That's a nice pooch. How old is he? Seven. You haven't answered my question. You haven't made your proposition. I'll stake you to the finest gambling house in town. And let you run it to suit yourself. With plenty of protection. Where are you going to get protection? You are not so hot for putting in with me, are you Beaumont? It wasn't my idea. Now wait a minute. I'll give you ten grand in cash right now. Ten more on election night if we beat Paul. And the gambling house offer still goes. What do I do? I want the low-down. I want you to tell it to a feature writer on The Observer. Everything Paul has got his finger in. The Swartz junk last winter. Taylor Henry killing. All the dirt on how he's running the city. Most of that stuff was just routine. Nothing in it. Alright. But there is something in the Taylor Henry business. We could start with that. Maybe. You mean, we ought to start with the ten grand? Thanks. It's alright. We haven't got much time on the Taylor thing. Hinkle from The Observer is outside. Just give him the dope. He'll put it in shape. You might start with .. Opal. And how you gave her the money that night. So you know about, huh? - Sure. That dough was for me. I still have some of Taylor's IOUs. Say .. you didn't knock him off, did you? Don't be funny. And that isn't all I know. Listen. You don't think The Observer is printing a lot of wind? I thought you were doing a lot of fast guessing, especially about that witness. Oh no. That is my ace in the hole. You now Sloss? Yeah, I know him. His brother-in-law killed a guy with his car and Paul wouldn't front for him. Right. And that's where Paul pulled a boner. Sloss came to me spouting. You see. He heard Taylor and Paul arguing on the corner that night. You know what kind of a guy Sloss is. Will he stand up? He won't have to. I've got his affidavit. And who else do you think is in with us? Janet Henry. Will you have another? No thanks. I figured that, but does she know anything? She is seeing a lot of Paul's daughter. She'll get her to talk alright. Say, I'm going to fry that ex-boss of yours to a cinder. Maybe. Say, what ..? And you know what you can do with this. Prince, get him! Jeff. Jeff! Take him to 328. He must be dreaming about Indians. Maybe he'll try to get out again and we'll have some more fun. How you making out, brother? Now, sweetheart. Your deal. Take it easy, Jeff. Listen, sweetie-pie. You don't feel good. You'd better lay down. Hey, watch out. You'll croak him. - You can't croak him. He's tough. He's a tough baby. He likes this. Don't you, baby? [ Door knocks ] Come on. Open it up. Hiya, Shad. This guy is a punk. Every time he comes to, he gets up and starts something. Out, huh? Water still in the tub? - It's a little dirty. He won't know it. Time for your bath, baby. He's okay. Can you hear me? Listen. You are going to tell me why Paul killed Taylor Henry. Alright? I'll have you worked on until you do. Nurse. Our patient needs another massage. I'll call again. A pleasure. [ Punching noises ] What's the matter? - The dirty stiff. He bit me. You should have knocked his teeth out first. Yeah .. where is your whiskey? What do you think he is, a rattlesnake? Well, he could have hydrophobia. Oh yeah. There is a bottle in my room. Did you find that whiskey? No, I'm still looking. You are still looking? Got a match? There's one in Beaumont's coat. No, wait a minute. A chaser? Yeah. Good idea. Here, look out. Hurry it up. Are you sure you called him? Sure. Give him time to get here will you. Yeah. Just relax. Clarkie. But I got it perfect now, Ed. Look. Take one. Four of spades. Fifty-one to one. Hey, Houdini. Powder. Hiya, boss. So they couldn't kill you, Ed? Look. You got to get hold of Sloss. Sure. Boy, you had me fooled. Right on the button. If you don't pay attention to what I am telling you I'll clip you again. No, not you. You look as if they put you through a meat grinder. You got to grab that guy. You got to keep him away from Shad. He's the witness they've been yelping about. Witness to what? To that argument you had with Taylor Henry. Shad got his affidavit. I tore it up and threw it in the fire. You did? Me, I would like to have seen that. Will you get moving. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Take good care of this mug. And make him take orders. If he gives me any trouble I'll break his jaw. A nice girl. I'll be back later. I asked for Rye. Drink this and like it. All of it. No. No wonder people beat you up. Oh. Yes or no? That's better. Here is your round-trip ticket. Boys. Mr Sloss is taking a trip for his health. Escort the gentleman to the station. Here is some dough for him. When I want you I'll send for you. Alright. Get going. Say, Mr Farr. The Observer says their witness was kidnapped. Any statement about that? - No. Sorry. Are you indicting Madvig for kidnapping too? Too early for a statement. It's only a week to election. - Sorry, boys. Kidnapped the witness, huh? Now what do you think of Mr Madvig? It don't look so good. Maybe he's been fooling everybody. I wonder if that is true. Sure. And he killed Taylor Henry. Remember that on election day. It's about time we got rid of Paul Madvig. Maybe his daughter could talk? Hello? Oh, Ed. How are you? Why don't you behave yourself and keep out of these scrapes? It's the Airedale in me. Say mum, let me talk to Opal. She left about an hour ago with Janet Henry. What? Yeah, yes. Alright, mum. Thanks. Goodbye. A telephone call for you, Miss Janet. A gentleman. Thank you. You'll excuse me. Robert, will you show Miss Madvig upstairs. Yes, Miss. Hello? How'd you make out? She's here with me now. Fine. I'll get Hinkle over there right away. And you know what we want. An accusation. I'll get it. Yes. Yes, alright. Robert, I am expecting a Mr Hinkle. Will you send him up as soon as he comes. Yes, Miss Janet. I don't think I can go through with it. Well Opal, we've got to help each other. You loved Taylor, didn't you? You must put everything else out of your mind. Oh, Mr Hinkle? Miss Henry is expecting you. Upstairs. The room at the end of the hall. Thanks. - Yes, sir. But didn't you hear your father say he'd kill Taylor if you saw him again? No, I didn't. Ed Beaumont came and .. How did you get in? The name is Hinkle. How much have you told her, Snip? - Why not leave me alone? Because he can't let you to know the truth. Truth? What do you know about the truth? - Don't listen to him. Come on. Not until she's heard everything. How you found out about the witness. - What? Yes, there was a witness. He saw your father quarrelling with Taylor in the street. Shad O'Rory got an affidavit and he burned it. Sure. That piece of paper would've sent Paul to the chair. He's innocent, Snip. Innocent? Did Paul Madvig force that witness to leave town because he's innocent? No. Because he killed my brother. Murdered him and left him lying in the gutter. You loved Taylor. Are you going to let them shut you up too? No, I'll tell. I'll tell everything. You are late, Hinkle. I'm sorry, Snip. It was the only way I knew to stop you. They wanted a headline. "Daughter accuses father of murder". Do you know what that would have done to Paul? We've got to believe in him, Snip. That guy wouldn't kill anyone. He's all heart. And you are just a tough guy. Hello Eddie. - Hiya, Frank. How you feeling boy? - Fine. That's great. Ha. Hey. Tell Midnight to bring me up an oyster stew, will you. And tell him to put some oysters in it. Right Eddie. - Thanks. How did you get out? The croaker says I'm okay. Are you sure? - Sure. How is everything? Not so good. But I'm not going to let the loss of a few scattered votes panic me. Only a few? Oh, can you cry the blues. This isn't my first campaign. It may be your last. What do you mean by that? Everybody in town thinks you killed Taylor Henry. Oh, forget it. I've been in tougher spots than this. Alright. I'll stop talking. Thanks, Midnight. Well, go ahead and talk. I'll listen. Okay. The point is. Your own boys will vote the other way if they slap you in jail on the murder rap. But they've got nothing on me. It's all kid's stuff. That's what you think. They got Sloss. Almost tore his head off. - It says what? I'll get an Observer. I suppose they'll pin this on me too. Why not? No-one had a better reason than you to get him out of the way. You know something, Paul? You'd better go down and talk to Farr. Think of something else. Are you covering up for someone? No. Then you'd better talk. If that Taylor Henry murder isn't cleared up pronto, you're sunk. I can't talk, Ed. Why not? I killed Taylor. Will you tell me what happened? It was an accident. He came in while I was talking to the Senator about him and Opal. The argument started later on the street. Somehow or other I hit him with my cane. He fell and smashed his head against the kerb. What happened to the cane? I burned it. What kind of a cane was it? You know. You saw it that night when I left. Oh. Oh yeah. What did you shut up for? You had a perfect self-defence plea. I want Janet Henry more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. Even if it was an accident, what chance would I have? You'd have more chance than you've got now. Did you really burn that cane? Sure. The next day. In the furnace. [Telephone ] [Telephone ] [Telephone ] Hello? Hello, mum. What do they look like? Tell Opal not to talk to anybody. And throw them out. What have we got for dinner? That's fine. I will be home early. Goodbye. Hey Ed, look. They must have been waiting for Sloss. Uhuh. You know where the Senator lives? - Yeah. Why? I want you to go .. - Hi, Ed. Hello. Come here a minute. [ Singing ] "Always in my room alone." "Walking the floor." "I guess I'm going crazy with love." "No relief." "From grief." "The moon is laughing at me from above." "Always in the gloom alone." "Walking the floor." "Listening to the feet of my .." Well if it ain't sock-me-again Beaumont. Hello. Jeff. This is the toughest mug I ever skinned a knuckle on. We're going to have a little drink. Okay. Not with these guys. I got just the place for me and you. Upstairs. The room is too little for you to fall down in. I can bounce you around off the walls. That way we won't waste no time while you're picking yourself up. Excuse us, gents. We got to go up and play handball. Me and cuddles. Cuddles. Ha-ha. "In my room. Walking the floor." "Wondering what on earth I can do." Sit down. - Thanks. Sit down on any chair you want to sit in. If you don't like that one, take another one. I want you to consider yourself my guest. We'll have a couple of drinks. And then I'm going to kick your teeth out. A swell chair. - You're a liar! There ain't a chair in this dump that's worth a dime. Look. Listen, Beaumont. You don't know a cock-eyed thing about chairs. My error. Oh, a wise guy. You think I'm drunk. No. You are not drunk. I am drunk. I am drunker than you are. I'm drunker than anybody in this joint. Jeff? Where have you been? I rang for you an hour ago. I bring the best men I've got in the world up here and what happens? I have to sit around all day waiting for a broken-down waiter. What do you want? Scotch. Rye. Don't think I don't know what you are up to either. I'm not up to anything. I was just looking for Shad and I thought maybe I'd find him here. That's a lie. You don't care where Shad is. It is me you are after. I know you. You're a heel. That's what you are. And I'm going to beat your brains out. Looking at you. I don't want to look at you. You're a heel. That's right. Have it your way. You think it is a smart trick. Trying to get me to talk. About what? Sloss? You know how I feel about that rat, don't you? You ought to get a medal. How'd it happen? Well, I .. Oh no, wise guy. I ain't talking about that. Why not? Secret? - Sure. That's between me and Shad and a lamppost. And you ain't no lamppost. I'll buy you a drink. Waiter! You're still a heel and I'm still going to knock your block off. Don't worry about me. Because Shad's got everything fixed. Rye. - Scotch. I wouldn't bank too much on Shad. He let McMurray fry. Well, I am not McMurray. A swell chance with all I've got on Shad. What have you got on him? He thinks I'm drunk enough to tell him. Go on. Tell him, Jeff. Hello, Shad. Come on in and have a drink. Meet Mr Beaumont. He's a heel. I told you to stay undercover. Well, this whole joint is undercover, ain't it? Good Evening, Beaumont. Hello, Shad. Get much out of him? Not much. I think you are a pair of heels. Never mind. They've had enough. You talk too much with your mouth, Jeff. I told you that before. I don't care what you told me. I am talking to you, Jeff. Well, quit talking to me. We are coming to a place where I am going to quit talking to you. Don't be a heel, Shad. The trouble with you is you are burned because I killed Sloss. Shut up! "Always in my room alone." "Walking the floor." "I'm going crazy with love." "No relief." "From grief." "The moon is laughing at me from above." That's it. I'm just a big-gun major slob. Anybody can push me around all they want to. And never do nothing about it. Let's blow. Give me the Roscoe. - Sit down. Remember, I owe you something. Keep your hands away from that ketchup bottle. Get a cop. Shad O'Rory is dead. Read all about it. In the morning paper. Shad O'Rory murdered. Paper, lady? Extra! Read all about it. Shad O'Rory dead. Well, that washes up the Sloss thing. - Yep. I wish I could say as much for Taylor Henry murder. Ed, I'm afraid I'll have to call you and Paul in on that. When? The grand Jury meets on Monday. It will have to be before then. I wish I could help you, Farr. I have to make a phone call. - Alright, Ed. Thanks anyway. So long. - So long. Hello? Hello, Ed. Say, I called you a couple of times. Sure. I got it. Swell. Bring it over to the house. I'll be there in about 20 minutes. Okay. Farr, can't we get going? What is it all about? Please Paul, sit down. As soon as Beaumont gets here send him right in. I am sorry to bother all you people but .. I am trying to get a clear picture of exactly what happened. Miss Henry. Did you see Paul and your brother together that night? Yes. Before dinner. Did you notice any antagonism between them? Yes, I did. Definitely. Senator. Yes? Did Paul and your son quarrel on the night of the murder? Not that I am aware of. My family has the highest regard for Mr Madvig. Hello, Paul. Hiya, Snip. Sorry to keep you waiting. - That's alright, Ed. Sid own. Miss Madvig. Your father had forbidden you to see Taylor Henry, hadn't he? Yes. And in spite of that you did see him that night, didn't you? Yes. And your father left the house quickly after finding that out. Presumably, to find him. I don't know. Haven't you felt all along that your father killed Taylor Henry? No, I haven't. She is lying. They all are. Even my own father. Why is everybody trying to protect this .. This horrible person, who is so fuelled with his own ego .. That he thinks he can have everything he wants. Get anywhere. That girl knows her father killed Taylor. You have got to make her tell you the truth. Just a minute, Miss Henry. Beaumont. Besides finding the body and going to Paul's before reporting it .. What else do you know about this? Only what Paul told me. What was that? That he killed Taylor Henry. What? Paul Madvig told me that he killed Taylor Henry. You see, he is one of those loyal mugs. He knew if I thought it was him, I wouldn't talk. And he wanted to stop me from finding out who really did it. Alright, Paul. Who killed him? He won't talk, Farr. But I will. If I do, will you kill a little petty-larceny charge for me? Go ahead. - Thanks. See, I needed something and there was only one way to get it. So I had Clarkie lift it out of the Senator's house. This. Look at it. It's an old cane but a new cap. Well? I know that don't mean anything until you know what's happened to the old cap. Here it is. I found it the night Taylor Henry was murdered. Not ten feet away from the body. Can't you see who Paul was trying to cover up for? Alright. Bradley, get this. Go ahead. The argument about Opal started in the house. Taylor ran out after Paul taking that stick with him. I followed and caught up with him. I asked Paul to let me deal with my son and Paul left. Taylor tried to push me out of the way so he could go after Paul again. He said things to me. He'd said them before. I don't know exactly how it happened. We struggled. And I grabbed the cane. And then. Somehow. You know the rest. Doherty will make a good Senator. Maybe. Think you can handle him? - No he can't. That's why he'll make a good Senator. So you picked him. Don't worry, Ed. You and Paul will enjoy working with an honest man. Once you get used to it. Going down the club? No, we're going to have dinner at home. The four of us. Where is Opal? She is going out to dinner. She didn't say anything to me. - Why should she? She is old enough to make her own dates. Isn't she, Ed? If you say so. - Well, I don't say so. I told her not to make any dates without my okay and that's what I meant. Paul Madvig, sit down or I'll get the hair brush. As big as you are. Let me handle it. Look, Snip. From now on everything has got to be lily-white around here. Does that go for this date? 0h, not exactly. He's more like a Tiger-Lily. You know, spotty. Do you think Paul would okay him? We'll ask him when we get back. (Ro_s)
