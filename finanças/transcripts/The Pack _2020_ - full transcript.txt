HC ZLÍN WOLVES Can't you come watch for a bit? -I've got a meeting, I told you. -You've always got one! There's only one of me. I'll pick you up later. David! Your water bottle! Come on, let's go, that's it! That's it, perfect! Miky, come out! Cut down the angle! Perfect, pass the puck. Keep it up. Good, pass it to the left. Come on, Cigy! Play fair. Good job, Cigy. Player first, then the puck. It was borderline. Someone could blow the whistle. It was a rammer. Yeah. No one goes through the defense. -He had the puck. -His hands were high. Drink up! -It's not ballet, I want them to fight! -Coach! I'll get this. Get stuff ready for two-on-ones. -Competition, Miky. -Where from, the fucking bush league? Your old man will make you work for it. -What time does practice start? -I was at the doctor's. I don't care. Get here on time or don't bother. Two-on-one, men! Common! Miky, move it! The last game against the Comets was one big disaster. Pardubice beat them 4-0. -Don't be smart and simply shoot… -Here you go. You have to get it there. -Luboš! -Leave it, Dad. Should I take it to the manager? Straight ahead. Last door on the left. Good luck, then. ON OUR OWN, WE CAN DO SOMETHING, TOGETHER, WE CAN DO ANYTHING. THROW ME TO THE WOLVES AND I'LL LEAD THE PACK I'LL STAY UNTIL THE 6 PM BUS. WE'LL COME WATCH. -Keep the stick on the ice! -Wake up! Next! Come on now. Skate it out! Move it, guys. -Fuck, wake up, Miky! -Move forward, Miky! David! Show us what you've got. -Move it! Waiting for a red carpet? -Come. Let's find his weak spots. That's it, David. Next! Go! Move it! Let's warm him up. Next one. Nice! Next! Go! Nice, well done! Between pads, spread him wide… -Change goalies, he's had enough. -He's got to hold on. Good choice. Come on! Got enough? Michal, to the net. Everything all right, David? Just breathe. Good! Michal, get the pucks! -Hey, guys! -Hi! -Can I take a picture with you? -Sure! Hold it for me? You all right? Sure. I just didn't get the dose right. No big deal. -Well done today. -Thanks. A smile… -Thanks a lot. And now me. -Okay. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Did you talk to your parents? Sure. Hey, lover boy! It's the rookie's job to get the pucks! Here you go. Let's go, dude. What a saucy little number, isn't she? Yeah, come on, you fuckers! Get him! Fuck, guys! Focus! -Where are the pucks? -That's the new guy's job! Cut it out and stop slacking off! You're turning into a sieve. Men! David is a boost to the team. Make him one of you, got it? -That's a hundred and fifty. -What? Fifty for coming in late. A hundred for walking over the logo. Šimi, write him up. We've got rules here. Explain them to him. We deal with our shit ourselves. No daddies, no mommies. -Right, Bob? -Yep, you will dream about the team! -What the fuck are you doing? -Tadpole's taking his first steps. Jerry can't get back soon enough. I feel I'm coaching a hobby league! DJ, give us some tunes. -Going running again, Beastie? -"Only practice makes the master." -Know who said that? -Pavol Habera? -You're a lost cause. -Just beat it, my friend! -Look ahead! -What the fuck are you looking at? Come on, asshole! -Come on! -What are you doing? -Individual practice. -Working on Tadpole's reflexes. Right? -What's that, man? -Diabetes. -They're letting cripples play hockey? -I'm no cripple! I just watch my sugar. The pump is for the insulin. You're always hooked up to an IV? How do you do it with that chick of yours? -Didn't get a chance yet. -What, no score? There isn't gonna be too much fun with him. I bet. Hello? Open up! Open up! This isn't funny! Open up! Hey! Open up! Are you fucking mental?! -The Wolves… -Go all in! -The Wolves… -Are gonna win! The Wolves are coming, the Wolves are here… …the Wolves' victory is near! Welcome to the team, man. Fuck, this isn't a joke! I need that pump! -Beastie, you missed the initiation. -I'm not too sorry about it. Get rid of the hair and you'll be one of us. Don't touch my hair! Miky, man! Isn't it the rookie's job to mop the floor? Calm down, guys! Forget him. Jerry will deal with the hair. That fuck-ugly flow hurts your peripheral vision. Fuck-ugly, man. Fuggly, that's what you are. Hey! How's the new guy? COACHES He's good. Had a save percentage over 0.93 in Brod. When he was still healthy. And he hasn't played for a while. -Have you seen him skate? -Michal will have to work harder. Try the new one out against the Rams? -He won't last the whole match. -But he won't slack off like your kid! -I make the roster. -And I pick the coaches. The sponsors want results, so you'd better do your best! Bye, then. …hardly repress the Rams offensive in the neutral zone. The Rams demonstrate their dominance in the match and entire season… It's not a power play, it's still five on five. Fořt on Kubiš, Kubiš back to Fořt… A chance for Honejsek! And great action of the Brno goalie! But the Comets still struggle to proceed the puck from the zone. Another attack from Rams and the chance for Fořt. He is trying to pass the puck, but he fails… But he tips the puck again and it's a third goal… Tomáš Fořt scores and the Rams… MOM And it's 4-0 for the Rams. This goes to show who… Nice view, eh? Must be great to play for a packed barn. We'll have to train much more for that. But we might make it. -Listen, who's Jerry? -Team captain. Got into a fight on the ice and broke his finger. Wanker. That dumb initiation ritual was his idea. -Want a sniff? -Can't, man. Jágr sees it all. You're stupid. Miky! David! -Bye. -See you. -Get out of my way! -What are you doing here? -Dad's got some meeting. -I could've taken the bus. -How will you get everywhere on time? -I'm not a baby! Wait up. I'm not done yet. David! …due to his distance to the bench there is next chance for Rams… Fořt wins the bully. Honejsek passes to Nosek. Nosek shoots… Nice shoot to the left wing and it's a fifth goal for Rams! Hard hit for Comets, lining for the next faceoff… but it'll be hard to forget this. A lot of fans are leaving already… -Hey. -Hi. Hi. -How was practice? -Fine. Dad, can Karol sleep over after dance class? I got a Rams scout to come see you play. If you do well, they'll be happy to have you. Seriously? That's amazing! I've barely agreed with the Wolves, and now you're talking about the Rams? They don't like the diabetes, but you'll show them it's okay. Okay? Are you crazy? You keep trying to prove something to yourself. This isn't about me! Give me one reason why David shouldn't make it. Kaapo Kakko's got diabetes and he won the World Championship. -I don't care about Kaapo Kakko. -What about Karol? You're way too young for that! That match is important! But she'll have to take the night bus back to Brod. -And go back the next morning. -I made myself clear. Karolína could sleep in the spare room. It won't hurt us, and it'll make her life easier. Hello, Doctor… Michal! Michal! Come here. -Got any cash? -Where would I get it? Didn't your mother send some? This time it's a given. Buffalo will win on home ice and Chicago will crush St. Louis. That's definitely not a given. St. Louis is on a roll now, it could be a draw. Detroit will beat the Rangers. I'll send you five hundred. -But it's the last time! -Thanks. -Now, time for practice. -I'm done for today. You'll get benched, then! -And who will replace me? Fuggly? -Michal! Twenty push-ups. Get going. Ladies, I found this awesome song yesterday. -You must see it. -Untangle these for me? Look at the singer, he's so cute! I gotta show him to you. Mom and that Jarda guy of hers fought all night. I can't wait to get out. Your squeeze is here. -Anyone got gum? -I do. -Me too. -No, let me. -I've got it! -No, me! I'm all packed for tonight. Look what he wrote to me. Too bad you're not in my class. -We'll see each other at breaks. -And at the dance class. These dance classes are stupid. I think it's a nice tradition. Plus, everyone goes. We'll learn some steps for the prom. It'll be nice. Just think of it as extra practice. -Later. -Bye. Hey, Fuggly! I've saved you a seat. Wait… -Could you cut that Fuggly crap out? -But it's just fun! To you, maybe. Good morning. You have a new classmate. His name is David Svoboda. Like all hockey players, he sits in the back row. David, borrow someone's notes so you can catch up. Anyone but Bob. Why not, Teacher? I'm one smart cookie! My point exactly. Take out your notebooks. Today, we'll be looking at different approaches to management. What is management? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? It's a systematic process of planning, organization… decision-making… Cool, huh? Like the special effects? -ARE YOU MENTAL? -I NEED THAT PUMP! Are you fucking mental?! -The Wolves… -Go all in! The Wolves… -MIKY: FAILED HIS INITIATION? -SIMI: WIMP OF THE YEAR! JERRY: DON'T PLAY HOCKEY IF YOU NEED A PUMP! Mom? -Hey! -Coming? Let's go. CULTURAL CENTER -Nice dress! -Thanks! -What bedsheet is that? -Just look at yourself. I'm dressed by the best. Gentlemen! The gentlemen's pick is your chance to pick a partner. Walk over to the lady of your choice, bow lightly and ask her to dance with you. May I have this dance? We ask the ladies not to turn down the request. Gentlemen, get ready. Don't rush. There's plenty of pretty dance partners. Go ahead. Well. Wanna bop, hot stuff? -Karol's here with me. -I got here first. The young man did get there first. Pick a different partner. May I have this dance? I thought hockey players didn't dance. -You haven't seen us yet. -You plan to skip class? -Like at school, when there's a quiz? -We'll see about that. Excellent. We'll start with a simple dance called waltz. Forward, to the side, slide your foot back. One, two, three. Two, two, three. -I've also got a tat. -Yeah? Where? You'll have to earn that peek. Ladies and gentlemen, get into position. Just pay attention. Get ready. Music, please. If you would be so kind, gentlemen. One, two, three. Two, two, three. One, two, three. Two, two, three… -You're doing pretty good. -Two, two, three… -Afraid he'll steal your girlfriend? -Rubbish. Excellent. Gentlemen, make sure you hold your partner firmly. We'll give it one more try. Get ready. -Sorry, I'm really thirsty. -Music, please. -Are you thirsty? -Yeah. -We haven't finished dancing yet! -Dance all you like! Wonderful. You two can dance with each other. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Do you have wine? -Are you 18? Would you like a Coke? Two Cokes. -Perfect. -Here you go. …it was really great, so many thanks to you for now… -Thanks. -Thanks. You should do something about those guys. That video was awkward. Who knew they treated newbies like that? I was totally dead from practice. Miky's got some nerve. Yeah, you need some nerve to waltz. I know you. I've heard that voice before. "Are you mental? I need that pump!" Of course! You're Fuggly! Our new tender! How do you like the team so far? -It's okay. Who are you? -Fuggly, meet Jerry. Team captain. And you two are fucking? These two? The only thing that's getting inserted here is Fuggly's cannula! -Another beer? -Sure. Anyone want a beer? -Yeah. -I'm fine. -Three beers. -A hundred and forty. -Put it on my tab. -You've got 500 on your tab. Who'll lend me some cash to celebrate my return to the team? Sorry, Jerry, I'm broke. -I can lend you a thousand. -I haven't got any change on me. -You can give it back later. -Thanks. I'll get your change. Thanks. You're good. Welcome to the team. YOUR FOLKS ASLEEP YET? I was worried you'd gone to sleep. Shall we go to bed? Can't you take it off? Don't think about it. Am I doing something wrong? Are you cold? Or is it because of the diabetes? No. I don't understand. I… I guess I'm just too tired or something. Sorry. Fuck, men, focus! Come on, Beastie! Get a move on! Dressed yet? Come on! Giddy up, Tadpole! Hey, Fuggly, hurry up! Hey, Miky! Hello, Cigy. Jerry! I hope you've been doing push-ups, because we're eating ice today! Old Tadpole got us some new jerseys. Tadpole's mama sewed them herself when she wasn't breastfeeding junior. I hope you fucking appreciate it! Fellas! How're you doing? -I'm good! We'll tear them apart! -Great. We still haven't decided on the final line-up. Jerry's back. We've also got two goalies. Do your best today. So Mára and I can finalize the roster. Got it? David, you're up today. We'll pick the starting goalie based on this match. Just so you know. -Sorry, I forgot to turn the sound off. -That's another fifty. -Did you explain the rules to him? -Sure they did. See you on the ice in five! Focus. Show us what you've got. Come on, guys! DJ, put on our song. LET'S HOPE YOU DO BETTER THAN LAST NIGHT The wolves' eyes are shining In the icy night Someone out there's dying Our victory gleams bright! The wolves howl and ravage Hunger in their heart The fangs of a savage Tear their prey apart! -Look, guys! What a fag! -What are you doing, man? Leave him alone. We've all got our rituals. Beastie, why don't you jerk that stick off next time around? Or stick it up Tadpole's ass, he likes that. The scout's here, so do your best! It's the Wolves against the Zlín Rams. Not an easy opponent. The Wolves didn't score last time. Let's wish them luck to lock up a playoff spot. Go, go, go! Get in front of the goal! Yes, that's it. If he takes his sugar, there's absolutely no issue. He's totally fine. PERIOD ONE Stay on him, come on! He can't get through! Behind you, behind you… -Láďa, behind you! -Stop… That's it! -Second line. -Come on, let's go! If you are scared of it, piss off! The time 18:39. David! The score is 0-1. Guys, come on… -Well… -Standa, wait a minute… -Sorry, this ain't… -Wait! Don't be… David! -What's wrong, David? -Stay calm… -Put something under his head. -What happened? Are you okay, now? Michal, put your gear on. Careful, lift him now. Let's not lose the pace, move it! -Be careful. Help him. -Here, sit on the edge. Back to the game, guys! -How are you? -Better. You are done for today. You need more sugar next time. What was that about? -I'm talking to you! -Not enough sugar. -Why don't you forget about hockey? -Guys, it's just one goal. But who let that goal through? You can't even catch a cold in that goal. I've got one piece of advice for you. Get a grip on yourselves! If the next period looks like this one, you'll do suicide drills until you're eating ice! Get a fucking grip on your team, Jerry! All right, men. Let's make Fuggly's fail right again. I'm fucking talking to you! Do you even give a shit? Or are you just texting pussy? Give me the phone! "Let's hope you do better than last night." Men, listen up! Fuggly can't get his dick up! Focus on the match, dimwits! You're playing shit! You two fagging it up or what? Fuggly, I'll grab your pigtails, just the way you like it! WE'RE NOT TALKING? He could've also fainted from something else. Yeah, right. He'll get some sleep and rest. He can go back to practice tomorrow. -Yeah, I'm fine. -You be quiet. No more hockey. His health's at risk and you don't care. You're overreacting. No one's ever died from sport. Can't you see what it's doing to him? Play hardball all you want at work, but not at home! -The doctor said it was fine. -Sure. -He'll get an automatic pump. -We can talk again then. Until then, no hockey. Get it? FANCLUB OF FUGGLY THE FAG DOES HE PUT HIS IV IN HER? FUGGLY'S VIRGIN FAG HAG Want a sniff? Which part don't you understand? Jágr sees all. You're an idiot. Hey, babe. What's up? Want some? "Fuggly the Fag." That your work? -Fun, right? -For you, maybe. That virgin fag hag joke is one of my best lines! Can we talk? -Did I just hear someone talking? -Chill out, sugar! -You stay out of it! -Or what? -Fa-fa-fa-faggot! -Karol! Icky little Fugglykins! One more minute. Put the worksheets on my desk. Don't forget to sign them. Thanks. Thanks. How did the test go? I might pass. Thanks to you. Aren't you going to see Karol? -Relationship gone south? -It's that obvious? -How's hockey? -Not good. -Mom won't let me play. -Don't worry about it. -You wouldn't understand. -Explain it to me, then. It's not easy. Dad's trying to get me onto this epic team. But now I've got diabetes and I messed up an important match. -You only play because of your dad? -Of course not. I knew you wouldn't understand! Yes, hello? Svobodová. Hello. Oh. Care to explain how you managed to get all those bad grades? Care to explain why you still won't let me play? Watch your mouth! When I get back, I'll quiz you. CAROL - SINGLE -MY EXTRALIGA SUPERSTAR -CONGRATS, GOOD LUCK! WAY TO GO, MAN! ARENA SCHEDULE GOALTENDERS Move! Hop! Faster passes! Straight ahead. Butterfly. Excellent. One. Two. Pass. Well done. One post… One last time! Nice. -Good job. -Goalie change. I see the rest was worth it! Good job. Miky! You're up! What are you doing, Miky?! Ten push-ups and get into the goal! Now! Check the puck! -Ready position… -Keep moving, okay? -You're still on the team? -Surprised? I'm here, as usual. David! Off the ice! David! -Hello. -Hi. And the stick on the ice… STILL SINGLE? Come on in. This little box takes care of everything for you. You won't collapse at practice, or during a match. How come? Didn't the doc say he'll only prescribe it after a year? You can get anything, if you try hard enough. And if you know how to make things happen. -But what about Mom, won't she be angry? -I'll deal with her. Give me your shoulder. It's going to hurt. Are you sure about this? Okay… Great job, David! That's it! How's your sugar? -Perfect! -Awesome. Get in the goal for a couple of matches. Then we can try the Rams scout again. Let's do another round, pick them up! Get him! Go, go, go! -What are you staring at, asshole? -Open the fuck up! David, mind the changing! Come on! Move it! Keep up the pace! Spread the game out, men, spread it out! Pass it! Push it from the zone! -It's a foul… -Fuck… What the fuck, man?! The time is 48:52. Visiting team player František Smolka gets a minor penalty for foul play. Don't let them hit you like that! Careful. Sit down. -Well, Beastie? -Hurts like hell. It's probably broken. We have to take him to the hospital. Careful. All right, men, let's rush in! Michal, fuck! What the fuck are you looking at? Time of the goal, 51:04. Goal for the visiting team scored by number 30, Martin Vítek. -It's okay! -Stanislav Balán, number 72, assisting. The score is 0-4. Give David a chance. There's no point to it. He hasn't had a chance to practice. Move, man! -Fuck, Bob! Start doing something! -Are you kidding me? -Fuck, men, let's get to it! Go, go! -Go for it, Wolves… Time of the goal, 55:25. Goal for the visiting team scored by number 13, Jan Guder. The score is 0-5. Hi. -Hi there! -Hey. -Not much of a match. -The guys didn't have my back. -You can whistle on this gimmick? -Wanna try? We'll be off. -Don't you have someplace to be? -Give me a break! Shut up and get into the dressing room. Move! Yep, you faggot, pick it up for him! -Anyone care to lend me some cash? -Try Fuggly. He's loaded. Sure. Only Jerry's got it all. When am I getting my money back? Men, Beastie's out for two months. It's broken. If you plan to go on like this, you can just fucking call it off now. -Hi there. -Hi… …in the NHL, so my question is: "Is the ice hockey world in the U.S. really that different?" Well, there's a lot of competition there, Florida for instance… How did it go? I was benched and we lost 5-0. You never let the team lose that bad without changing goalies. He's always going on about my diabetes. -What happened to your mask? -Dropped it. Dropped it? -And hello to you! -Hello. How's it going? I've got great news for you. Come on! Again. -One more try. -Need a lift? I guess. -Get into the back seat. -Come. You trashed the motorcycle as well. Almost trashed yourself too. Time for a new car, I guess? I'm just waiting to win the lottery. I just won five grand today. Easy! I bet that Florida would beat Detroit. How did Miky do today? -He's had better days. -Is that so? Why didn't you give David a chance? Mára tells me he's in great shape. Mára. It's not that easy. A match isn't the same thing as a practice. -And the diabetes… -What do you mean, the diabetes? You can pull up over there. Thanks. -We'll talk about it later. -Bye. Don't give up. You gotta fight. He'll never give me a chance. Let me handle that. You make sure the team leaves you alone. But how? I'm outnumbered. When I was in the army, the old hands wanted me to polish their boots with a toothbrush. I refused. -And they left you alone? -They kicked my ass. But I fought back. I didn't make it easy for them. So, they left me alone. They found someone weaker. Maybe Mom doesn't have to know about this? -What? Get going! -I'm done. What do you mean by that? -You just keep embarrassing me! -Embarrassing you? -Without hard work, you'll get benched! -So what? You think that pretty arm candy of yours will stick around? When you're on the bench? You really think so? Women want success, my friend. Remember Mom. What the hell is that? Stop that noise! It was going to be a Christmas present. Any good? Do you like it? -I like it. -A lot? -A lot! -How much? It's the best! This is all over the school. Have you seen it? -It's from the hockey team, isn't it? -Calm down. It's just stupid jokes. You've got an interesting sense of humor. -You can't be serious! -It's important. -Yes, sir. -What about it? -The money's ready. -How long has this been going on? I'll deal with it myself. How exactly? Mom, please! Just leave it alone if you want to help me. No way! Do you know who's doing this? Give me a name. It doesn't bother you at all? You're never home! You don't see what's going on! I'm earning a living for us, I can't be home! Have you even thought about what's going on in that dressing room? I haven't, but if you get involved, you'll only make it worse! You okay? Yeah. I didn't know the dressing room was that bad. It is. We'll deal with it like men. Mom would just take it to the coach. That would only complicate things. I've got some good news for you. Mára told me you're doing really well. I got the Rams to give you another chance. The coach will never let me start. Leave that to me. You just hang on for a while longer. Remember that snitches never last. When I was in the army, there was a guy who snitched. The others beat him up so bad he ended up in a wheelchair. Hang on. Stay strong. This episode will soon be over. Okay? -Well, David, who was it? -No one. So your mother made everything up? Why are you lying? What about the rest of you? Jerry? Care to tell me something? As you wish. Michal! You know anything about this? Practice won't start until this is sorted out! David, do you remember now? Come back when you can give us some names. It's just stupid jokes. -Who created that profile? -I don't know. Off the ice with you! You think we're stupid? What about you, Bob? Nothing? You think this is teamwork? You'll do suicide drills until someone owns up! Where are you going? Good day! What's going on here? Nothing I couldn't handle! -Hi, Dad. When can you get here? -What did you tell them…? I didn't say anything, but they kicked me out anyway. …let me finish something here… -Great, come see me then. -Sure. Yeah. Bye. Oh, shit! You won't break them like that. They won't say anything. Oh, but they will! We've had enough. We can't go on! I say when you've had enough! We won't let anyone bully us. Let's go, men. Off you go, then, wankers! This isn't over yet! Come on, man. NICE PHOTOS YOU NOTICED? CAN I GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER? WHY? I'D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER. You did well. Mom's complicated things for us, though. What now? I'll talk to the coach myself. -And? -Don't worry. I have an idea. FANCLUB OF FUGGLY THE FAG -SNITCH! -MOMMY'S BOY! REVENGE WILL BE SWEET! May I have this dance? Enough, okay? -I have to go to the bathroom. -Sure. May I have this dance? -A dance with your girl, sugar? -Forget it. I wanted to help you escape this freckle head. Watch your tongue! Compared to Karol, you really lowered your standards. -Get out! -All right. -I'll punch you right here! -Chill out. Let's not fight. But if you want something, I'm going to the bathroom. Got to wash my hands. I smell some… ginger pussy or something. Forget him. He's an idiot. Go for him! That's enough. Let's go. We should've gone to the police. And what would we have told them? Read the report! Two stitches and some bruising. Hardly bodily harm! Maybe it's not a crime. But harm's definitely been done! If it weren't for Lenka, he'd still be lying there! You're overreacting. Snitching won't help. David managed to handle it. How did the other guys end up? I was outnumbered, but I didn't make it easy for them. -Bye. -Bye. How's the new car? Great. Thanks. What happened? It's nothing. Cool wheels, Coach! Some bonuses rolling in? Mind your own business. Why are you not changed yet? -See you. -Bye. Gentlemen, breaking news from the world of media. Fuggly's not on the net! -How about not being here? -No way. -Is Daddy not paying for your Internet? -Daddy's got other expenses now. -You should apologize to Miky. -Why? -Your daddy's buying off the coach! -That's a lie. So where did Coach get that new car? You and Daddy are assholes. You should apologize to us. But especially to Miky. Apologize! Now! I'm waiting. -Guys, let it go! -Whose team are you on? You really should get rid of that fuck-ugly hair. See? Now you're one of us. What the fuck's wrong with you? What exactly happened? I fought. You told me I should fight. Well, you went a bit too far. You could've killed him. -Hi. -Hi, Luboš, how's Miky doing? He'll be fine. Won't be able to play for a while. I'm glad he's all right. See you later. Bye. Where did Coach get the money for a new car? -Why do you ask? -Just wondering. I lent him some. WHAT HAPPENED? I JUST WENT MAD I WAS IN A CORNER. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYONE. THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? DAD'S ON IT. BUT IT FEELS WEIRD. YOU'LL NEVER TRUST YOURSELF UNLESS YOU START DEALING WITH PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN! Yeah? May I? I still can't understand why you did it. I let it go too far. I didn't know how else to defend myself. Why didn't you just tell the coach? I wanted Dad to be proud of me. I think you know what's at stake, so listen up. -Those guys tried to knife you. -What do you mean? It wasn't about hair. It was an attack. But that's not true. I don't care. We need to make it clear. You were being bullied in the dressing room. That it was self-defense. -But… -No buts if you want to play again. Think of the Rams. They were trying to knife you, understand? A word. Before he gets here. I don't want to leave them here alone. Try anything and you're both suspended, clear? Sorry. This is our last chance to agree on what actually happened. No agreeing. Those guys attacked David with a knife. Look at Miky. Does he look like he attacked anyone? Serves him right! He almost killed David at the ball! Calm down. As if you've never sat in a dressing room yourselves. These things happen. The team needs to stay in the Extraliga at any cost. Imagine the shit that would happen with our sponsors if we're dropped. I don't care about the club. They're after my boy. Come on in. Who created that website? -It was just a joke. -We'll be the judge of that. Bob. David just wouldn't adapt. And Jerry wanted us to be a team. He just wanted to trim David's hair. So he'd become one of us. He was getting bullied because of the hair. -He just went crazy on us… -Sure. That stuff just happens. Right, David? -What happened? -He was defending himself! Your son can speak for himself. I was defending myself. But I overreacted. What are you talking about? -They tried to knife you. -They didn't want to kill me. This changes everything. I came here to investigate a serious attack on David. As reported by his father. But the only one I see with a bandaged head is Miky. This is enough for getting suspended, David. You got anything to add? I don't know. Do you want to amend your statement? No. Without David, we're fucked. We don't have a goalie. -Don't punish the whole team. -Fine. We'll postpone the suspension to next season. You'll sit out ten matches. PULL Dad? Not now. You hungry? Not really. DAD Feeling better? -The cast didn't stop me from running! -You're crazy! Well, men, fuck it! Fuggly got rid of all competition and his daddy paid up to see his boy in the goal. So, make sure you support him in his fucking dreams! Got it? Well, men, fuck it… Sit down, Bobby! This match decides if we stay in the Extraliga. David is the goalie. Support him the best you can! Viktora's the backup goalie today. I don't care what's going on in here. Today, you're a team. Lose, and you can forget about hockey! Jerry, here's your new jersey. What? You shouldn't have fucked around. Beastie's the new captain. -Here, Beastie. -Thanks. He works his ass off, you should do the same. Jerry, the defense has to be a wall. See you on the ice in five! Give it all you got! Come on, men. -You think this is okay, Fuggly? -What? That if you don't like something, Daddy just pays up! -That's not true! -Right! -Let him be. -Off to the ice, men! You're the new boss here? Just because you got a new jersey? I couldn't care less about an extra letter on my jersey. Let's go play! -We'll go when I say so! -Go on, then! -Should I? -Yeah. -Really? -Yeah. I bet you've got weights even in those gloves, Beastie! Off to the ice, men! Why are you ignoring my calls? Wait! You can't start today. Don't go there. Why? If you're there when you're relegated, you can forget about the Rams. -But I'm suspended. -I took care of that. David! Quit slacking off! Off to the bench with you. I'll be in the stands with Karol. It's a relegation match. You'll be with your team! I'm going to Mom's tomorrow. My sister will pick me up. -I'm… -Gonna hit me again? EMERGENCY EXIT -The Wolves… -Go all in! -The Wolves… -Are gonna win! The Wolves are coming, the Wolves are here… …the Wolves' victory is near! -What's with Jerry? -He was demoted from captain. -You think he'll be okay? -Yeah. -Today with the egg, yeah? -Yeah. The Wolves have lost the last two matches. Beating the Hornets won't be easy. They will need all their strength to stay in the junior Extraliga… Hang on! Good! Come on, boys, let's go! Let's hit them hard! Move it! -Great job, David! -Perfect, keep it up! Come on! That's it! Come on, come on! Excellent! -Jerry, you're up! -Go, go, go! -Stop it, you jerk! -Jerry, fuck, you can't leave David alone! Fuck you! You gotta get back right away! David's great today, isn't he? I need to take a piss. They'll get a goal sooner or later if we let them play like that. -Let me do my job! -Start working, then! Give me a break, for fuck's sake! Great job, David. Great! But the rest of you, help him out! Jerry, you're doing shit out there! All the pucks are bouncing off! Ram them up, use your body! Mára? Guys, don't try to attack. Let's start defending. We might get a chance with the breakaways. Yes, go for it! Let's get to it! Good job! Good! What was Fuggly talking to his daddy about? -Rams transfer. -Isn't he suspended? Daddy took care of that. Told junior to sit the match out. If we lose, he can forget about the Rams. Move, asshole! PERIOD TWO Come on, Jerry. Go for it, Wolves… Get back, Jerry, for fuck's sake! Don't let him shoot! -Goal! -Time of the goal, 38:40. Goal for the visiting team scored by number 27, Tomáš Polenský. Assisted by number 17, Jan Froněk. You can't leave everything to David! He can't keep that all by himself. Cover the pass, the puck's mine! Forget about any Rams transfer. You're staying here with me. Let's crush them, come on. Doesn't matter, guys. Let's go… PERIOD TWO Well done, Beastie. We can still do it, keep fighting! Take David off the ice. -What? -I can't risk you losing. We're good, you and me, aren't we? I know it was bad in the dressing room. But without David, we're going to be relegated. You owe me something. Men, you're doing great. Skate on! Give it all you've got! Figure the defense out. You're doing great, guys! Don't give up. We'll get a goal in too. Jerry! You're taking it too easy. -David, you're off the ice. -What? Why? I just spoke to your dad. He said you have some health issues. Viktora is up instead. Viktora, get ready. -We're fucked. -He's gotta be kidding. I might as well go into the goal myself. -I don't want him to collapse on the ice. -Bullshit! He wants to take him off the ice? He's fucking kidding. -We can't do this without Dave! -He's gotta be kidding. What the fuck are you doing? Svoboda spoke to me in the corridor. If the boy collapses, I'll end up in jail. -Do you have any health problems? -No. He stays. No. He's not playing. Viktora, get ready. Mára, if you were head coach, would you let David stay? Well, this match depends on him. You're the new coach. Give it all you got! You're doing great, but we need to win this match! Who are we? The Wolves! Let's go! Come on, men! Let's go! Last period! We can do this! We'll win! Give it all you've got! Right from the start! Fly over the ice, okay? Come. PERIOD THREE There we go! And it's a tie. Goal for the home team scored by number 98, Jan Zvěřina. -Did you see that? -What? -Block the shots! -You gotta go back! Well done, David! Come on, let's go! Jerry, there's a free player behind you! Penalty shot! Red 25. The time is 59:10. Penalty shots for the Hornets. You're such a cunt, man! Pray that Fuggly blocks it! Leave him! He was stepping in for the defense. Whose team are you on, Jerry? You're benched! -Rubbish! Tadpole fucked up! -Go get changed! They have a chance to win the game. Let's cheer for our goalie, David Svoboda. -Yes! -Come on! -Yes! -Great! Let's go! The match ends in a tie. Shoot-outs will decide which team stays in the junior Extraliga. SHOOT-OUTS It's still a tie. Last chance for the Wolves goes to Robert Kvapil. If you do a backhand deke, he always opens a six-hole. -You expect me to trust you, Fuggly? -He's made the mistake every single time. Yes! Perfect! It's there. Now it's up to you, Fuggly. Great score by Kvapil, but the team hasn't won yet. Now it's all up to David Svoboda. If he manages to keep the slate clean, victory is ours! Svoboda, Svoboda… Well done! Great! Great! -Fucking great! -There we go! Amazing! Wonderful job, guys! Fuggly, man, we made it! That's a hundred for you, Fuggly. I may be on the rise But still I got the fear I won't make it and they won't remember I feel like the end is drawing near I keep holding on, but I'm torn asunder No one props you up when you need it The whole damn world Keeps giving you a cold shoulder People are swine, but they are beat too The winner's the one Who doesn't just roll over Tell them I just won't give a damn I've always had to hold my own I'm not begging or borrowing from them To them I remain a complete unknown Everyone's got their advice But they're after prestige They only bring you down And no one has your back Pretending they're healthy Is everyone's disease Throw me to the wolves I'll become the leader of the pack Tell 'em I'll gladly run the longest race But I ain't gonna waste my time away Tell 'em they're welcome to laugh In my face It's always too early to give up midway Tell 'em I'll gladly run the longest race But I ain't gonna waste my time away Tell 'em they're welcome to laugh In my face It's always too early to give up midway Tell 'em I'll gladly run the longest race But I ain't gonna waste my time away Tell 'em they're welcome To laugh in my face It's always too early to give up midway Tell 'em I'll gladly run the longest race But I ain't gonna waste my time away Tell 'em they're welcome To laugh in my face It's always too early to give up midway Tell 'em…
