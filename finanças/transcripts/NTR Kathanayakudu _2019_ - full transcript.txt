Cut it...cut Rama Rao, you do not have to really fight a bull We have a dupe to do that You fight in a close up shot, enough Dupe...? Who is that? He is the one That is cheating Is this how they shoot wars in cinema? Then will they fight really? If you shoot like this you are cheating the public I will really fight with the bull, bring it here - Bring what? - The bull! You want to fight? Are you taking a dig? Brother, did you see it prancing wildly? It will trample you I am the son of a farmer If I get scared of a bull, how can I become a hero? Bring it here I am ready Rama Rao, you are so stubborn Why will you not listen to us? Alright, get the bull here Bulli Reddy, bring the bull here Action! Cut...cut I was the only young hero in this industry until now I thought I had no competition Now I have to revise my opinion In this cinema you are not the only hero I am there too People call me Nageswara Rao How will I not know you? My younger brother and I watched your 'Balaraju' thrice Very good! - Where are you from? - Nimmakuru near Gudivada Really...? It is my hometown too Other side of Gudivadi Venkataraghava Puram Your arm seems to be broken Director sir At least you could have been cautious Whaaaat? If he jumps on that animal I should have been more cautious? I was yelling 'cut...cut', Nageswara Rao He heard 'cut' as 'hit' it seems He hit everyone in the film 'Mana Desam' Shall we go back to work? 1st we will take you to the hospital, brother 'Bless the hand that feeds!' Thanks to your meals ticket we survived today Betel leaves from Chettiyar Not now, brother I have an upset stomach Have you not eaten yet? 'Brother...brother?' My younger brother 'Rama Rao, someone has come looking for you' - Brother...?! - Brother, what is this cast? - What happened? - During the shoot When he jumped on the bull... ...it tossed him - Where is it now? - What? Bull? Like older brother like younger brother 'Sunnundalu' and 'Kajjikayalu' Savoury and snacks That foldable cot which all 3 of us fight for ...is all yours till your stay here I will thrash you if you eat All that is only for my brother How is everyone at home? If you are doing well, they will be good If they hear about this injury, how will they be? Here, a letter from your dear wife Freshen up We will go out to eat 'My dear husband' 'Letter from Rama Tarakam' 'I hope you have nothing lacking over there' 'For your dreams to come true' '...I pray to river Krishna and Goddess Durga daily' 'Do not worry about us' 'Our son Ramakrishna was not keeping well yesterday' 'So I took him to the doctor' 'He has prescribed medicine to be given thrice a day' 'He has been crying now' 'Our next door lady is very keen to know when you will return' 'I have no idea why' 'I intend scolding her one of these days' 'Please take me to your cinema soon, dear' 'I feel like watching a film with you' 'Take care of your health' 'Your loving wife Ramatarakam' Brother...brother What happened? - Brother - Nothing I just had a slight dizzy spell You go and shower For how many days? What...? Starving If you deny it swear on me If I do not eat for 4 days, is it the end of the world? Our Subba Rao has not got financial aid He will pay when he gets Until then? Get up Let us go You cannot stay here a moment longer Where to? Without knowing anything for sure, no point leaving Farmer's son and a registrar You quit everything for the sake of cinema If you stop eating too how will you live, brother? If our parents got wind of this they will feel terrible Sister-in-law will die! All this is only for them, brother As soon as my hand heals we will start the shoot I will not have any other problem This time I will tame the bull I will not go to Bezawada either I will take care of you and stay with you - You have got it wrong - 'Rama Rao' What is this? We thought you gave your meals ticket to us We never knew you were starving instead Your personality is astonishing, brother You were responsible for his starvation You will fill your stomach and burp Will you not even know if he ate or not? Brother, these friends gave me shelter Does it justify them taking your coupons? Brother, good deeds will never go waste Not meals ticket, many more tickets will be sold to watch his film, be patient 'Yes...yes' Brother, you are amidst shrewd con men Better be careful! 4 cinemas And a contract for 2 years 1st year Rs 500 per month Rs 5000 per cinema 2nd year Rs 750 per month Rs 7500 per cinema Until we finish our films you cannot accept any other offer Agreed? If you act in every cinema without a dupe like this... ...you will have a perennial cast You have not seen him in action Even in the film 'Manadesam' you know the backs of all the artistes He beat them black and blue! What are you thinking? Are you okay with the contract? I did not want to work for a monthly salary But I have given in to this again Alright - I am the hero in all the cinemas? - Of course You sign the papers Sign, Rama Rao Golden opportunity I am signing for a new life Please bless me, sir Go on, sign Ready sir Janaki, are you ready? [song from 'Shavukaru'] "Friendship turned into a love shower Brimming flowed as a joyous river" "Weaving its waves, joy demonstrated Victory of good over evil celebrated" What do you think of the film? Look there The film is good But not the theater It will do well in good theaters 'Looks like the collection may be dicey' Brother, this cine field will not suit us Let us go back to our hometown Do not be hasty, Trivikrama This is not the end of the world He has a bright future What can it be? Right from the beginning this has been disappointing Safe guarding his self respect he quit his job as registrar Now he is under the mercy of others He is always been like this He will go looking for trouble Brother, let us go We have to tell the people Cinema is a powerful medium All they do is sleep in the theaters You saw only those who were asleep I saw them watch the film even when they were asleep Cinema rules the theaters today Tomorrow it will be part of their daily life Our culture will be a vital part of cinema One who does not pay heed to his parents will listen to his friend, brother There is no better friend than cinema 'Goddess, I have a humble request' Those who watched this story and by word of mouth May they be granted goodness of health and all kinds of assets and wealth As soon as Anji prays to Pathala Bhairavi the Goddess says, 'so be it' The cinema ends on this note I am waiting for your opinion about these dialogs, Mr Nagi Reddy Do you want me to be honest or lie? Thank you so much Those who watched this film and by word of mouth Interesting! Chakanna, can we book Nageswara Rao for the hero's role? I feel...Nageswara Rao is a great actor and a dear friend of mine But as a director I cannot visualise Nageswara Rao as Thota Ramudu, sir What is this? Nageswara Rao means fantasy hero, right? - Have you watched 'Keelu Gurram'? - You are still in 'Keelu Gurram' mind set I have moved on to 'Pathala Bhairavi 'now But Thota Ramudu is different Girls are wrapping their books with photos of Nageswara Rao On the silver screen 1st time an ordinary man ...becomes an extraordinary man That is Thota Ramudu's character If Nageswara Rao cannot fit we need a big hero for this This is not a role for a big hero But a role which can make a big hero Enough of your opinion! If you cannot get a hero for that character ...we must change the character to suit the hero What do you say, Mr Pingali? Thota Ramudu's character will not change, sir His role cannot be compromised Who is it? Rama Rao, huh? Our Thota Ramudu is Rama Rao I did not have faith when Reddy was so sure He flutters proudly like a victory flag Winning horse of Vijaya Vauhini banner We will redeem our loss in 'Shavukaru' including interest with this project 'You see that demi-god with the big belly?' 'Break his belly with this steel mace' 'Carry out my order' Hit hard! How they celebrate a cinema! Clapping and whistling Just like that Nepali sorcerer says in the film If we do what the public like ...this celebration is the result, Nagi Reddy! Collection will also multiply, Chakanna Strength of our cinema is proved by Thota Ramudu's character What do you say, Reddy? Rama Rao, 1st super star of Indian screens 'Hey! Who is on the screen?' 'Rama Rao garu, I say' 'Rama Rao sir is here' 'Praise be to NTR!' [loud cheering] - Glory to Thota Ramudu! - Jai Pathala Bhairavi! That is Thota Ramudu over there 'Bawa' My dear City of Madras welcomes you - Your father - Nana Come to me, son I watched all your films along with amma - Ramakrishna, how are you? - I am good, father - How are you? - I am fine Come Look over there, sir 'Pathala Bhairavi' hero, Rama Rao Ask him for his autograph Rama Rao sir Autograph please Hold him Bawa, you said the cine field is not trustworthy If my beloved Tarakam sends me off ...whatever the field, I will taste the fruits of success - Thank you very much, sir - 'Vanakkam' 4 rooms Verandah And a back yard Rent is Rs 46 Rs 46? - Every month? - Yes, dear How is the house? Any house is like its owner's heart That means how is it? Spic and span Spacious This is our room Beautiful Waist band? Looks expensive After 'Pathala Bhairavi' I got an advance for 6 films I bought with that money You bought this waist band instead of my coin necklace Coin necklace I gave it to you to sell in case of emergency This is not jewellery, dear It is confidence given to me by my wife How can I sell that confidence? Should I not preserve it for my entire life? After the shoot of 'Pelli chesi choodu' ...I will be free for a month Shall we relax in Ooty's cool climate? Ooty? "Get married, rent a house happily Spend the rest of our lives heartily" "With comforts to heart's contentment you should all lead a life of enjoyment" Cut it Mr Rama Rao Concentration should be on the song Lip movement and at the same time on the hand movement It should be very natural, okay? 'Mr Rama Rao' Have you never played the harmonium before? No, sir My wife knows I used to watch her play Mrs Rama Rao, please come Me? Please come and teach your husband - Aiyaiyo! - It is alright, madam Come, Tarakam Tarakam, come 'Mrs Rama Rao, please come' [song from 'Pelli Chesi Choodu'] "Get married, rent a house cheerfully Spend the rest of our lives blithefully" "With comforts to heart's contentment you should all lead a life of merriment" Marvellous! This is the marriage between music and acting! Rama Rao, did you observe? Just act like your wife That will do Yes Let us go for take, come on Thank you, guru Watch your disciple play his role now "Get married, rent a house happily Spend the rest of our lives heartily" "With comforts to heart's contentment you should all lead a life of enjoyment" Marcus, actually- Mr Rama Rao, would you mind lending me Rs 200? Gummadi sir, your expenses seem to be escalating In spite of my advice you continue to smoke I did not ask for this You know of the draught in Rayalaseema now? I want to help a friend in Kurnool to the best of my ability I heard about it too Poor people of Rayalaseema At least our Govt should support them? 5 years since we attained freedom What to do, sir? I will help Organize a cultural event in the entire state for Rayalaseema - And we can collect funds? - Good idea As far as I know, no film hero has ever thought so much for the people - You will be the first - Not just me We will form a group of like-minded people Only harmonium - Or do you play other instruments? - I know a bit of violin Tarakam I mentioned about Ooty, right? That plan is- 'Dear one and all I am your mother' 'Your Telugu mother' I have 3 children Andhra, Telengana and Rayalaseema One child is upset and crying now Hands of the other children should wipe his tears, right? Mother, we give you our word not to make you cry We promise to help the people of Rayalaseema Prakasam, this should not be a drama It must be something more interesting Mr Vemulapalli Sri Krishna is part of your troupe I think? Yes, why? Let us sing in praise of our Telugu land - Song, huh? - Fantastic Both the ladies have agreed Rehearse the song "Raise your hand in single-minded unison Praise in chorus, man of Telugu origin" "Your past name and fame accompanies you all the same" "This land is known for its sacrifice of blood and bravery; no compromise" "Palanadu belongs to you So does Velanadu too" "Palanadu belongs to you So does Velanadu too" "Revel in the glory of Balachandrudu the valiant warrior of Palnadu" "Young general Tandra Paparayudu committed royal suicide for Telugu" "Nayakuralu Nagamma, Molla, Mallamma Devi exemplary women synonymous with bravery" "Sibling of every Telugu Manchala, wife of Balachandrudu" "Our Telugu land is the mother who gave birth to many a brave warrior" "Land for mothers here with courage crystal clear" You can collect funds from your colleagues in the cine field Who will have the heart to say 'no' to you? Why are you asking the public? This mission is not mere charity But for Dharma and it is people's duty to lead a responsible life Reminding people of their duty is the duty of artistes like us "Buoyant and bouncy is river Gautami" "River Krishna brims with prosperity" "Buoyant and bouncy is river Gautami River Krishna brims with prosperity" "Enough if Tungabadra as its tributary dances overflowing with felicity" "In a nation where granaries flourish no dearth of clothing or food to relish" "If 30 million Telugu people unite on earth" "Our neighboring lands will know our worth" "You share the same mother Telugu land's sister and brother" "Why be hassled at hand by step children of another land?"

What do you think of yourself now? Do you know how much we are investing on you? Only to watch you, people buy tickets and flock to the theaters If you interact with them who will watch your films? Did it not occur to you to share your plan? Govt can take care of the people It is enough if actors stay behind the screen You are bound by our contract How will you respond to this? Tell me What should I tell, sir? I do not need a contract which entails me to obtain permission even to seek alms I thought I should act for the people If it comes between my people and me I will say 'no' to cinema also I am indebted to Vijaya Vauhini for giving me this stardom status Thank you, I take leave Rama Rao garu, what happened? Give this collection to Ramakrishna Mutt Ensure it reaches the people in Rayalaseema What happened? Your brother is upset? He broke Vijaya Vauhini's contract Is that so? If he does not act in their film as per their contract ...other producers will hesitate to book him Milk in Madras is not thick enough, dear Can we buy 4 buffaloes? I am fine if you are back to riding a cycle I gave up only on Vijaya studio's contract Not victory! Listen, brother Nagi Reddy refused to give you a job, eh? From now on we will give jobs We will produce films on our own We will convert our drama banner into a cinema production house Call Pundarikaksham He will support you Your wish is my command!

Please accept it, Rama Rao If you respect us accept this token advance Madam, please persuade him Tarakam, accept it Very good With our best wishes, madam This is what I like about you Madam, you offered to serve us lunch If you serve me lunch and also pack it in a lunch box for me ...I will make Nagi Reddy eat and convey the good news Bawa, can I buy buffaloes with that money? That amount is for 'Chandrahaaram', dear Just like the film's title can I get you a gold necklace? Why spend on me, dear? Spend this money on your dream of making your own film Tarakam You never ask me for anything Are you not there for me, dear? Only if I need anything more precious than you There is nothing, right? "O' Rama, allow me to be by Your side to serve You daily" "O' Rama, give me the pleasure to be Your loyal, forever-servitor" "O' Rama, allow me to be by Your side to serve You daily" Stop...stop Hero will meet all of you, please wait - He left from here, right? - You are a star now What brings you to our humble abode, brother? You could have sent a dove- If I am a big star now will I become a stranger? I want to produce cinema with my younger brother Very good! 1st film from the banner of Thota Ramudu is praise worthy! You will choose only renowned directors Mr K.V.Reddy or Mr L.V.Prasad? Thatineni Prakasa Rao Brother Accept it I told my brother about your story 'Pichi Pullayi' He agreed to produce it Thank you, brother Hey Raju, you will be the music director - What about my advance? - Wait, brother Hey Yoganand, you will direct the 2nd film from our banner Prepare yourself I am ready with our story, brother 'Thodu Dhongalu' Very good Thotakura Venkat Raju, you will compose the music for this cinema too This is for both the projects In addition to your brother you think of your friends' future too You are really a hero 'Rama Rao sir Will you come out please?' I am coming Please wait "Like a hidden shadow Like your attendant following you" "Like an unseen shadow Like a friend following you" "I would like to pamper you in all that you want to do" "O' Rama, allow me to be by Your side to serve You daily" 'Gireesam sir, is it not a sin for widows to remarry?' 'I am so upset by your innocence' 'Parasara Smriti clearly emphasises widows should opt for remarriage' 'Scholars in Rajamahendravaram have written treatises on this' 'In olden days widows remarried as a general practice' 'Venkatesam' Cut Excellent Go and eat - Well done, Janaki - Mr Rama Rao I thought it is difficult to understand Gireesam's character You did a splendid job No one was prepared to accept this role With your courage, you have settled my debt of gratitude to writer Gurazada Only he who dares tastes success Am I right, Rama Rao garu? Pullaiah sir 'Kanyasulkam' is not just a drama It is a philosophy in its own right Sorry, brother if I hit you too hard "Those who think of you all the time Those who plead to You, deity divine" "O' Lord, grace us forever in any avatar you favor" "Those who think of you all the time Those who plead to You, deity divine" "O' Lord, grace us forever in any avatar you favor" "Seated in the heart of Your devotee To be seen by human eyes a rarity" "Seated in hearts of those devoted to you To be seen, a rare phenomenon anew" Onion 'pakoda' If this is for me what about your brother? We have to work and you will munch 'pakodas'? "O' Rama, give me the pleasure to be Your loyal, forever-servitor" "O' Rama, allow me to be" Careful! - Aiyaiyo! - Ramakrishna Nothing to worry, ma - Should you not be careful? - Alright, father "O' Rama, allow me to be by Your side to serve You daily" This divine image with 4 hands holding a conch and discuss ...should appear in 'stop block', Marcus 'Reddy garu, I have exhausted all my techniques' This is for 'Mayabazar' How can N.T.Rama Rao play Lord Krishna's role? He is the perfect choice Think about it once more, Mr Reddy If it is a fantasy film and Thota Ramudu, agreed Nagi Reddy feels Rama Rao is too rough for the role of Lord Krishna He played Lord Krishna in 'Sontha Ooru' That film did not run even for 4 days That was Krishna in a drama in the film but this is Krishna in a real role Reddy, this is a cinema on a huge scale If necessary we can call Mr 'Eelapata' Raguramaiah Or else we can call CSR Chakrapani garu, Rama Rao will be the perfect choice He has a spark of mischief in his eyes Mavullayya, give me a cigarette Sambayya, how many coconuts did you bring? '1116, sir' - Total waste - Sir? I said it is a waste Go ahead Sir, cigarette Lord Krishna If the producer does not like how will the public accept him? He will come now? Not just Rama Rao Reject me too Sir...! 'Broad shoulders' 'Clear gaze in his eyes' 'Remarkable stride' 'Grace and splendor' He is blessed with all these qualities, Mr Reddy God should never greet "Glory to our benefactor, Lord Krishna who rests on the snake 'Adisesha'" [song from 'Mayabazar'] "Praise be to the destroyer of evil Praise be to the protector of His people" "He embraces his devotees in harmony Praise be to the ruler of worlds many" "Your sublime stories handed down to us" "Whether written, watched or heard too" "Fortune will forever favor you Hand in hand with blessings anew" "With a peaceful heart and relaxed mind rewards and recognition you will find" Pithambaram You have transformed a man into God with your make-up Oh no! I am not worthy of that praise He does not look like God because of my make-up It was the lord of 7 hills, who sat daily in front of me and made me apply make up Shot okay Print 'Praise be to Lord of the 7 hills' 'Glory to You!' 'Praise be to our creator' 'Glory to You, Lord Vishnu' 'Glory to our one and only savior' 'Praise be to You' Srikalahasti, Tirumala and Tirupati Ganesha temple at Kanipakam 'Throvagunta Bus Station' Come...come in Get NTR's blessings I want to get NTR's blessing Will this bus take me?

This is a story to be told It has to be made into a film - Mr Ravikant Nagaich - Sir What did you think of the scene I narrated? 10 heads of Ravana ...should get established very clearly Each head should appear one after the other I think this is the 1st time on Indian screen Sir, I have a couple of ideas Through trick photography if we want the desired effect ...it will take 2 hours for each head I need 3 cameras and I must try various masks So...you need to stay still for 20 hours Without even moving a millimeter Remain in the same posture - Like a stone - 20 hours? Without moving? It is alright I will do it Brother Being stubborn, you almost lost your eye sight in the film 'Chiranjeevulu' Do you want to be paralysed now? Time to take Telugu cinema to greater heights, brother My dream is a day will dawn ...when a Telugu cinema poster will be stuck in at least 1 wall worldwide Result can occur anytime But effort should begin from us - Okay, Mr Ravikant, are you ready? - Ready, sir - Sound - 'Running, sir' Roll camera - 'Rolling, sir' - And action!

NTR sir, excellent, sir...excellent Oh! You are...you are a genius, sir! Brother! NTR sir What happened, brother? Brother! Rama Rao sir, when you breathed life into Ravana for the silver screen ...you have got a befitting son who shares his birth star 'Moola' You may think it is merely a coincidence, but wait and watch He will be a connoisseur of arts and as emotive as Ravana Since Mercury is in his own house he will not have any demonic attributes He can differentiate good and bad and be an asset to your lineage - He will live upto your name - 'Moola' 'Kethu' star Fervent warrior My star is 'Swathi' Ruled by 'Rahu' Lover of peace Any war is for peace after all? In addition Gemini being his ascendant ...he will be ever young Which means our boy will never grow old Even after 60 years... ...he will be busy making all his dreams come true Did you hear that? You need to keep an eye on him What name do you have in mind? Come, my darling prince Forever young means Lord Krishna, right? Maybe that's why he is the 8th child A child who will never age My heir in acting too Nandamuri Balakrishnudu Like it, Tarakam? - Nice name - Come, dear Now let us write your name Come...hold this ring Nandamuri Bala...Krishna!

Alright, okay Nothing wrong in what brother said, dear When a lightman wanted money to pay his children's tuition fee ...you wrote a cheque for Rs 1000 Rs 1000 is the annual income of a poor man If you had paid the fees in the school personally, I would have been happier He is a slave to bad habits How are we so sure he will pay the fees? Should we be vigilant even when we help? We need to guard our earnings Respect money For women to live with self respect ...financial freedom is also necessary You should be cautious and not squander away hard earned money We are concerned only for your well being Wanting lyrics for this song ...Kamalakara Kameswara Rao asked the lyricist to write Lyricist said, 'Why do you need lyrics when Savitri can sing with her eyes?' Then what, Bullemma? Director sir - Call for action - 'Ready' - It is getting late - 'Ready...action!'

'If I say no, will you keep quiet?' 'That is why I will say yes' 'You are smart, Brihannala garu' 'I take leave' 'Cut' No one can even imagine the role of Gireesam No one can do the role of Brihannala You have done more than justice to both the roles Shall I tell you something? Because you are Telugu that English man does not know If you had been that English man no one could have caught you - You flatter me - It is true We got a research center called NTR for our Telugu cinema We can try any experiment here Brother, 1st shall we shoot? Such a noble soul!! He woke me up at 3:00 a.m daily and made me practice for 3 months at a stretch "Notes, count, rhythm in unison chime" [song from 'Nartanasala'] "Notes, count, rhythm in unison chime" "To her anklets tinkling divine" - Look,Rama Rao is so beautiful - Yes,sir "Goddess Shakti danced to their rhyme" "Lord Shiva's heart in that time soaked in happiness sublime" Hello?

All are Madrasis from South India? How can that be? We hail from Andhra We have an identity of our own Our self respect and our own tradition How can everyone be slotted as Madrasis? We both are selected for Padma Shri And we are from Andhra Pradesh Madam Prime minister Brother, looks like your mind is not on the game More than the joy of receiving Padma Shri I am hurt about being categorized as Madrasi Why do you think I shifted to Hyderabad? So I will not be slotted like this! How about thinking of settling down in Hyderabad? Whatever it is, our industry should be within our territory This is not an issue pertaining to our industry It affects our entire Telugu community Even after obtaining our own state we are classified as 'Madrasi' A change has to dawn Our lineage has to be respected Our language has to be revered Wisdom of our Telugu blood must spread nation wide 'Emergency was declared throughout the nation' 'Whichever political party opposed the affairs of the central Govt' '...was taken to task by the military' 'Voice of democracy was locked' 'As stated by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh' 'Youth leader, chief minister's son' 'Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin was taken into custody' 'And tortured brutally' 'The entire State protested in fury' 'Tamil Nadu changed into a sea of fire' 'Law & order crumbled' 'May this revolution flourish!'

Sir, I am an ordinary make-up technician NTR sir made me a producer With him and Balayya sir I produced 'Annadammula Anubandham' He gave me such a golden chance But, sir- What is the matter, Pithambaram sir? Our film is not releasing day after tomorrow, sir N.T.Rama Rao's cinema is not releasing as per schedule? What are you saying? Hello? Sir, I am unable to send the print out of the lab Whole city is under curfew Cannot even reach the railway station Distributors are worried your fans may cause damage to theaters They are plaguing me with phone calls I do not know what to do I am already drowning in difficulties I referred your name, borrowed money and produced this film If the film does not release tomorrow? I am in a state of shock, sir Do not worry, Pithambaram I am there for you This does not affect only you It is a prestige issue for me also At any cost N.T.R cinema has to be released Alright, sir Cinema is toil and sweat of a large group of people Future of so many families Faith that millions of viewers place on us No Emergency has the right to stop this You stay there I am coming over Father? Hari...? This is Pithambaram's 1st release He cannot bear it if it does not release Father? Come with me I am going to the lab Brother, there is a curfew - So what? - Driver has not come either Do I not know to drive? After all curfew, uncle Passenger is N.T.R! - Who, sir? - Can you not recognize? N.T.R! Good afternoon, sir Lab is closed We have orders not to allow anyone inside What?! Father- Sir, wait You cannot go in Pithambaram, print is ready? None of the workers have turned up, sir Those who are here are scared to load the prints They have stopped the release of my film Even after I told them this is not Tamil cinema - Hari - Father Bring the van here Brother, load the prints into the van We will talk to Mr Vasan You go and do your work Do not be scared I am there for you Thank you, sir 'Annadammula Anubandham' What is this? What is happening here? N.T.R's cinema is releasing What are you waiting for? Go ahead and load Riot and violence are rampant following the CM's arrest Curfew has been imposed Emergency has been declared Of course, your Emergency pertains to authority My urgency is for the sake of millions of fans who believe in me Sir, without prior approval ...we have strict orders to stop any work at any place Whose approval? During Emergency rule you need police approval for any task Otherwise I have the right to arrest you In that case you will not have enough trains for our fans who will revolt Will your jails be able to accommodate? Brother, we have loaded the prints You have deposed the ruling party and imprisoned the general public You want to bury the people's basic rights under prime minister's authority You are breaking down our system for the sake of individuals Imposed Emergency rule, thinking no one will question you He will come soon One who will question you will come He will arrive to wipe out decades of arrogance embedded in our nation Then the ruling party will know the true meaning of Emergency! Mr Rama Rao You may not be armed with our dummy cinema guns This heart which breathes cinema will not be scared of your gunshot We will go ahead with our mission If you want to stop go right ahead He is a true hero, sir N.T.R With make-up, a hero Without make-up More than a hero! Hey Dhandapani, I believe Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor wanted to watch our film 'Julie' - Arrange for a show in Bombay for them - Alright, sir I feel lost without Chakrapani How is his health now, sir? Cigarettes have burnt that man's life He will never pay heed to anyone's advice Do you listen to me, hmmm? How many times I have told you not to be impulsive or angry? That ACP spared you being a Telugu himself Without any qualms he has beaten up CM's son, Stalin And arrested the chief minister Where do we stand? Not even trying is equal to committing suicide I am not such a coward More than me my films are important My fans are my foremost priority I do not know where your anger will take you Come, sit down What brings you here? I am constructing a studio in Hyderabad for Ramakrishna - I need your advice - Are you mad? What is in Hyderabad other than boulders? When the film industry is here why build a studio over there? My deepest desire is our industry moves to Hyderabad Brother Nageswar Rao is also building a studio there Rama Rao, to expect the industry to follow only you ...both of you are not the only heroes Look at this article, read it Written by Kagada Sharma Krishna is making a film called 'Kurukshetram' with his sons Junior heroes challenge the senior star heroes Will they accept this challenge? Rama Rao, Krishna and Shoban Babu have entered this field They have revealed your age to the general public If your film released once a month ...not even 1 flopped in a year But now it is rare for even 1 film to taste the joy of success However great we may be we must accept change To sum it up in a nutshell, you need a runaway success like 'Mayabazar' Do you have such a film? This is not the age to fight with passage of time We should give Time only 1 golden chance to win over us After we pass over, Time can be proud of being the winner I will see I take leave now You have come home for the 1st time after we shifted here, brother You could have brought your wife too She will be coming soon Are we not settling down in Hyderabad very soon? Serve me now We got this fish from river Krishna because it is your favorite Even if he says 'no' you keep serving him We are not in the habit of saying 'enough' Only you will count your calories and starve your taste buds Sister, do not fell shy Just keep serving non stop Listen, brother What about that challenge by Kagada Sharma? Young heroes and star heroes What do we do? 'Daana Veera Soora Karna' - What? - Which I will direct If you act as Lord Krishna I will play Karna If you choose Karna I will be Krishna Choice is yours And my dream of directing you will also be fulfilled I would love to take up this offer too Besides it will prove to our fans we have no difference of opinion too But- What, brother? I have promised Annapoorna I will not act in a mythology film with you What? Yes, brother, during the shoot of 'Sri Krishnarjuna Yuddhamu' Whichever hero he acts with in any mythological film ...viewers look only at you! Only yesterday I watched Hindi cinema 'Sangam' Starring Raj Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar Remake that in Telugu He can choose either hero's role I am fine with that That is a love story, right? So your husband can walk away with the laurels? Brother, do you still smoke or have you kicked that habit? One shot in the morning Depending on my role sometimes I am sailing in the same boat! After my by-pass I take a shot only in a shot!

Namaste, madam 3 days since you came home '3 months since you ate at home!' Forgetting food and basic comforts why this struggle and starvation, dear? Mad woman! Compared to the satisfaction of a new creation for future generation ...how can this be burdensome? Why take on so much at this age? What if something happens to you? Even after I die, I will be alive as the evergreen hero on silver screen My dear! Editor sir, will you also behave like this at home? I will not get such an opportunity This is my last cinema Mr Joshi What are you saying? In 30 years I have edited 1000 films I will never get such an opportunity I want to edit this film and retire gracefully Such a film will never be repeated with 1 actor donning 3 roles He has donned the caps of producer and director Krishna, Karna, Duryodhana 'Daana Veera Soora Karna' 'Rama Rao 'garu', you have created a masterpiece in 43 days the world will revere' 'Guruji' 'What did you say?' 'Are you rejecting him on the basis of his caste as a charioteer's son?' 'How can you accuse like this?' 'My brother Duschasana' 'Fetch the crown studded with precious gems' 'Uncle, king of Gandhara' 'Fetch a golden throne with the most intricate carving' 'My dear subjects, receive the blessings of the sacred Bhagirathi river' 'Musicians, sing in your dulcet voices accompanied by auspicious instruments' 'Royal ushers, get Karna ready' 'Women verily blessed' 'To be a just and good king to his subjects as pure as his golden earring and armor' 'Apply sandalwood paste on him to spread the fragrance of the new rule' 'Under the auspices of my subjects supervised by our expert priests' 'Auspiciousness always and in all ways' 'I purify his lineage and remove all blemishes smeared on him' Janardhan, when will we reach our location? We will reach Madhumalai in half an hour, sir Then drive through forest area for 90 minutes Is Nagabushanam coming there? Day after tomorrow, sir We have planned a song with Jayasudha and Jayapradha combination How can you call them by their names? Jayasudha madam Jayapradha madam Did you snip their umbilical cord and name them? Sorry, sir My mistake To watch our 'Adavi Ramudu' Sorry, 'Adavi Ramudu sir' Expectation is really high, sir Why refer to the title with respect, you stupid donkey! You act over-smart I will skin you alive Sorry My guruji's hermitage is somewhere on this route Who is your guruji, brother? Sree Saila Jagadhguru Swami Seer with divine attributes Rama Rao sir, guruji is observing his vow of silence now He will not talk to anyone or bless anyone I do not mind, I will take his blessings from a distance Jewel in the crown in entertainment field Your name and fame has spread worldwide Nandamuri Tarakarama! I am so fortunate I came just to see a glimpse of you I feel cherished with your blessings now This entire universe ...will bless you, my son Will you eat with me? My pleasure Food is a sacred gift from God, Rama Rao I will take leave, swami May you be victorious Swami, seeing him you broke your vow of silence You never let anyone touch you But you embraced him and blessed him May I know the reason, swami? He is a fortunate soul blessed by Lord Shiva I wonder how many people are aware of our epics and historical events But in Andhra Pradesh he is the sole reason our people are aware of our classics He is destiny's child He is unparalleled king of our silver screen He is the controller and guide to minds and emotions of the future generation "When born as a human being a mere clay doll (s)he cannot be" [song from 'Adavi Ramudu'] "If he is stubborn single-mindedly another Brahma he can be" "With hard work and sincerity men can become seers saintly" "They can become noble soles easily" "For generations to come they will be a beacon of light extra ordinary" "Worshiped for eternity duly" Mr Narasaraju, dialogs are all fine Really humorous But in the film 'Yamagola' Emergency chaos should be obvious This Emergency is at its peak of autocracy Let us criticize it vehemently In such an entertaining subject ...will a serious episode like Emergency fit in? Mr Tatineni, why will we convey it seriously? It should be on a sarcastic note Even Yama will listen when a leader says it Leave it to me now You know the forced sterilisation program? That is good enough Sounds good Go ahead 'I am a Govt employee with wife and children' 'I had a quota for the surgeries' 'Unless I meet my target I will not be paid, so I complied' 'That is all, sir Please note this point' '- On whose orders? - Govt' 'Not the Govt, sir' 'Without any official authority' '...a youth leader controls the Govt' Cut Rama Rao sir Good, very good We are referring to the PM's son directly Is it not dangerous? Venkatratnam sir, he wanted me to target the prime minister I was the one who restricted it to the son "My dear lassie petite if I peck you like a parakeet" 'You cannot bear my advances my beloved princess" "My dear lassie petite if I peck you like a parakeet" [song from 'Yamagola'] "You crossed your limit, naughty rogue" "Stop teasing me, you wicked bloke" "Enough of your rowdy behavior my dear prancing prankster" "My dear lassie petite if I peck you like a parakeet" "You cannot bear my advances my beloved princess" - Song is enticing - Of course But seeing how the women in our family react, I am apprehensive No doubt at all, it is a super hit I will watch it again for sure "Have you lost control, dear?" Wait Tell me, how is my 'Yamagola'? No one is voicing any opinion? You did not like it? That stupid parrot song with that young heroine? What was that silly dance? Not good, Lokamma? Jayapradha must be younger than me, father With her as your pair- I am a youngster too I am just 25 years old in the film Then you can carry a book and go to college too If my role demanded that I would do even that What, brother? Take the example of Nageswara Rao sir Not wanting to reveal his age he buttons up his shirt very high While you show off 4 buttons down I do not know if the audience will watch Taking extra care is brother's style Being carefree is my style Tarakam, what do you say? Actually, brother-in-law This touching and teasing Intertwining feet, all these steps Crossing limits of decency I think my sister thinks that Do not feel bad about it "You crossed your limit, naughty rogue" If these are the words what can I do? In 'Chandragupta' "In the youthful drizzle of your smile" Did I not act refined without touching the heroine? Of course, you did From song to song, role to role there will be variations I agree We must change with the times Only then people will listen to me Wait and watch, this film will become a sensation This will inspire many more films to follow Indeed, yes brother-in-law It should inspire! 'Cyclone in Diviseema' 'It is reported to be the most devastating cyclone of this century' 'Diviseema was wiped out' Cyclone, brother-in-law It will only get worse If you are planning to shoot, cancel it Whether I try to call Nimmakkuru or Komaravolu I am unable to reach anyone, uncle Cyclone is really severe it seems We are in Madras Our friends and family are over there I am scared, uncle Oh god! Electric poles have fallen down? How about the poor people living in the huts there? Dead, huh? What are you saying, uncle? How are our people now? Find out about the neighboring towns and villages? My husband wants to know the status of towns nearby? 'It is ravaging one town after another, huh?' 'Taken a toll on so many lives?' Petrified of floods, people are huddled to one side Oblivious of the sea on the other side ...many were swept away by the waves 'Out of 900 people in that village only 3 have survived' "Hero of the silver screen" "Film hero evergreen" "VIP with a face to please Listen to our pitiful pleas" "Super star celebrity Listen to our tearful plea" "Water turned into a curse as tsunami Our dreams washed to embers suddenly" "Our walls crumbled before dawn break Our lives we are forced to forsake" "Oh my Lord!" Our son is missing I am sure he is dead You cannot anyway bring him back alive At least bring his body We would like to see him Cyclone has hit 83 villages and turned them into graveyards Look! Lord Venugopal's temple situated in the village of Hamsaladeevi The water rose right up to the temple tower Only 100 people who took shelter in the sanctum survived Brother? Greetings, Mr Krishna Rao "Wish we could count the corpses countless" "We pray to deities endless offering vows limitless" "Breathless with fear; en masse Unable to breathe our last" "Tears of the survivors streaming Bursting as deluge, grief screaming" "Mother, you have survived coped with this disaster?" "Is your son safe from the deluge of water?" "Diviseema is erased from the earth's face" "Court of Vijayanagar long ago lauded Diviseema poets for their talent exalted" "All we want somehow a handful of rice now" My heart seems to explode in agony "Telugu Super star please Listen to our anguished pleas" People who elevated us to such lofty heights Are now far away from food and their near & dear ones Tell me, brother What shall we do? Earlier for the sake of Rayalaseema drought relief ...our film industry collected a sizeable amount Our industry collected donations for our brave soldiers We have always risen to the occasion This time too we will do the needful Inspired in the same manner we head towards Diviseema now Namaste If this NTR ANR Welfare Fund ...can wipe away even a few tears, we have achieved our goal We presume you will help us and we are banking on you Sister-in-law is not here, brother? I will make the 1st contribution That is wonderful Please do, brother - Brother - Yes, Chellamma - What will you give me? - 1 minute, brother Help in whatever way you can to the victims of the flood Brother, did you really drink liquor in 'Prem Nagar'?
