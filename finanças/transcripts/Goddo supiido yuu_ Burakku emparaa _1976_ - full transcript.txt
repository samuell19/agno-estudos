You wanna fight? I'll smash your balls! Your name? None of your concern! I'm leader of the riders here. You can't beat me. Don't talk big. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Why not? You beat me! I'd like that. I beat you? My hands are too good... For what? GOD SPEED YOU - BLACK EMPEROR Listen to me. He is a new member. Name: Tamaru, Oshikai Tamaru. These are our regular members. He's Seventeen. As young as you are, take care of him. He's shy. Introduce yourselves. Maybe you know me, I'm Decko. Jobless. I live in a tunnel. No home. I drive better than anybody else. I'll teach you, if you want to learn. I'm Homma, manager for Shinjuku. I'm in charge of liaison. What's your school? He's afraid of you. I'm out of school. Jobless. A beggar? Yes. To come to the Hanaya is my job. I'm Takahashi. I quit Komaba High School. They call me Hideo. I have no job. My nickname is beggar in the Heights. I have no job. I loaf in Shinjuku. That's all. Your nickname? I like porno. Call me Pants. I'm Kanehara. I come to the Hanayana every day. I'll try to get along with Tamaru. They call me Vagabond. I didn't quit school. I've never been to school. I don't work. A loafer. Yes. I'll explain about us to him. Anyway, there are lots of stupid bums in Shinjuku. I hear the Pink Panthers have 400 machines tonight. Take care. Two bikes carrying flags will lead. Follow them. Don't mind cops. Stone them. I'm your leader. "Charged for gathering with weapons." "Notice of Judgment" I was busted last May. Were you there? Among the group. A taxi was destroyed by rough riders. You did it? No, I didn't touch the taxi. WW the judgment? Because I was in the group. "Gathering" is against the law. What did your mother say? Nothing. She'll go with you. It's a kind of court. It'll sentence you. What do you expect? They'll put a tail on me. Like what? A probation officer or someone who watches me. Not a reformatory? No. They'll want testimony about the case. I have parents who are supposed to take care of me. Then their words carry weight for your judgment. That's right. What will your mother say? I don't know. I don't talk with her. What do you want her to say? The judge will tell her she's a bad mother. And I'm a bad boy. We're both bad. How will she discipline me? What will my parents do with me? Things like that... If she says she doesn't want me in her home, I'll be finished. What will happen? They'll send me to reform school. Not prison I hope. It depends on your mother's words. What will she say? Why not? Because he doesn't look happy with me. He wants me to stay out. Who will go? Who will go where? Tomorrow. Oh, that. There's a bigger problem. Your Aunt in Kofu is seriously ill. So what? She's your aunt. Who will go? Tomorrow? Who do you want to go with you? Not alone? I want you to go. Me? No, thank you. I don't want to go. Me either. No more. Let's lead a better life and be happy. What will I say? Maybe you want my promise for it. I just want to know what you'll say. They question me: I answer. That's all. What will you say about me? Good things at least? Good, naturally. When did it come? The 18th? - Right. Of April? - Does it say March 18th? No, they sent it on April 18th. They want me. Important documents are kept here. Remember that. We must not lost it. We should lose it. Then we would be in trouble. You'll come with me tomorrow, won't you? I'll get up early. You must. I wonder if you can. I get up early every day. When will we leave? We must be there in time. By bus? Of course. How long will it take? An hour and a half. Let's leave at eleven. Don't be late. What did you say, while I was out of the room the last time we went there? At the office? You said something. You wanted me to leave and talk together. About what? I'm asking you. Don't you remember? I do. About what? I'm asking you what you talked about. Give me a hint so I'll remember. The last time we went there. How long ago? The date doesn't matter. I'll take a memo next time. I forget things. I'm getting old. Nobody's getting young. I mean... At my age, people begin to lose their relatives. I did. Don't look sad. I cry easily. I cry at night. Who cares? News of death depresses me. I lost two of my sisters. You come with me tomorrow? Then it's okay. Stay at home. What for? Why not? It's no fun. You must take a bath. I can take it elsewhere. Don't waste your money. Leaving? I'll come back early tonight. Must you go? Will you come back? Why not? This is my home. You're worried about the last time. You thought your parents would give you up. It shocked me. My two pals and I were busted last time. Their parents came to take them home. If we're under age, we need them to accompany us. My old man didn't come, so I had to stay in jail. Why didn't he? I heard them talking on the phone. My old man asked the cop to lock me up. How did you feel? I got mad. He shouldn't have done that. I got busted, but I did nothing bad. Nothing serious. But the cops yelled at me, so I said I was sorry. I waited in vain for my old man. He didn't come. So I got mad. I thought I could kill him if he kept me in jail. My wife was gone. I went to my parents' home. There was a call from the police station. I asked them, "What did he do?" They said he was with a group of hoods. "They were high, so we arrested them." I asked,"Is it a crime to be with hoods who are high?" "Can you arrest him for keeping company with hoods?" "Can you punish him for that?" They said, "Your son doesn't deserve punishment." "But he was with a group of addicts." I said,"If he doesn't, let him go with our without me." "If you can prove his guilt, he should be legally responsible for what he did." "He must pay the penalty for the crime." I saw the police before I went home. The officer said, "I called your husband but he hasn't showed up yet." I got used to the police routine. I went there often. I said, "Let me wait for him." I was carrying a sack of potatoes. The cop said, "Take him home." But I said, "I didn't take the call." "My husband will do it." The fat cop said, "Why do you think your son was picked up today?" I told him I didn't know. Then my husband came He said, "What are you doing here?" I said, "I phoned home but you were already out." It was eight thirty or nine. My husband came. He's very straight forward. Whenever the police release my son, they want me to write an apology. That time too. I asked them,"Why did you lock him up?" I was angry. "Did you arrest him merely for staying with hoods?" "You did it only to show that you're working." I waited for them to answer. They said, "We understand what you want to say." They suddenly changed their attitude They tried to soothe my anger. And flattered me. Then my son was brought in. He heard me criticize the cops. He must have imagined that I beat the police for him. Anyway, I made it clear that I wouldn't apologize to them. And they knew that they couldn't force me to. I brought my son home. I asked him, "Did you do it?" He said, "I didn't do anything." I said, "You're paying for whatever you used to do." I tried to protect him from the cops many times before As his father, I knew he's a bad boy. I saw him high. He got busted for carrying hot stuff before. I went to many police stations. He got busted everywhere. I wrote many letters of apology. He was a bad boy. We should've made him realize what life is. Drive carefully. Then you won't be in trouble. I drive carefully. No speeding. You observe the law; we keep quiet. I don't speed. Accidents can't be stopped after they occur. Speeding ticket? TOKYO DISTRICT COURT SECOND OFFICE Finished? They kept me waiting. What did they ask? - Nothing. Somebody killed two parsons. And had to pay 40 million. They told me the story. Why? - Who knows? Maybe they mean it as a warning. Is that all? They told you nothing else? They took away my driver's license. For how long? They can't tell it here. Maybe 125 days. No! Not that long! Not 125 days. They want me to lead a decent life. They know you loaf? Our meeting's no good now. I call our members requesting them to come. But only those who join us every day attend. Other members don't come, unless they're invited. Even if they come, They just sit behind regular members. They aren't very frank with us. Our group, Black Emperors, seems to have two factions. We've got to contact each other more often. We should meet more often And deepen our friendships. If you have an idea, speak up. Let's hear it. Go on. Speak. We've been riding together for a long time. It's time we talk with each other. You must have something to say. You've got to be more cooperative. You enjoy riding with us, but... you don't want to share the hardship. It's been eight years since our seniors established this group. They weren't always happy. They had hardship. They survived. We can't betray them now. It is our duty to keep this group. The Black Emperors are here. There are no leaders. What's your plan? No plans. Leader? We've got none. You didn't come for nothing. It's a meeting. "CHECKING" You got any weapons? Just a band. I'll frisk you. If you ride too fast, you'll lose your license. You turn me on. Just a kid. He's touching my balls. "Don't try to stop me..." We're going to Harumi. Other groups of riders beat us last year. Listen carefully, Listen! There might be another fight. I'll explain what happened. When we went to Harumi last week other groups attacked us. When we returned, we were only eight. One is still missing. If we fight, we must prepare for it. How you can tell who's your enemy? It's possible we'll fight them again tonight. Be careful not to fight your friends. Better strip so we won't fight each other. Slow ahead. They aren't listening. Listen to me! Listen! Whistle! People in Roppongi Streets! Black Emperors are here! Try to avoid trouble with the cops. But keep your pride as Black Emperors. We aren't thugs or gamblers who are afraid of the cops. We fight sometimes, but we aren't gangsters. Ours is a touring club. But when the cops are behind you, remove your stickers. Don't let them have a chance. We're from Shinjuku. Don't worry about groups from other places. Worry about yourselves. It isn't difficult at all. No matter what other groups may do, we've got to help each other. That's all. One more thing. We have friends from Ibaragi tonight. You'll know them by their bikes. They'll join us again. Be nice to them. Accept them in your circle. Don't hesitate to talk with them. Don't treat them like hicks. I don't like it. I told the leader of the Irabagi group. I believe none of us will look down on them because they're from a small town. Men from Ibaragi, rise. They came all the way from Ibaragi in the rain. Remember their faces. The one with the umbrella is their leader. What will you do? Eat Supper? You may go, if you like. Dismissed! You live away from home? For a long time. Where? A coffee shop in Shibuya called Moses. Alone. - Alone. I was lonely. I had 400 yen but a cup of coffee costs 500 yen. You couldn't pay? I threatened a customer in the shop. "I'm short of money. Will you give me 100 yen?" He gave it to me. I walked from Shibuya to Shinjuku at midnight. I walked alone all the way. There's a slope at the corner of Aoyama and Jingu. Up the slope there's a gate to Shinjuku Park. I climbed over the gate. I wanted to cross the park. A short cut? It was dark inside. I was lost. I wandered for an hour. Alone in the park? I walked and walked. It's a big park. How did you get out? I walked along the path, but I couldn't find an exit. I thought I'd cross the woods. Then I lost my way. How did you eat? I ate wherever I went. Watanuke gave me good food. Miyadera fed me, too. Milk? I stole it. Bottles of it. Weren't you sleepy? I slept during the day. Work at night? I slept in the morning. At various places. That apartment house, too. On the roof? No, on the stairs. Cold? No. If only I had money. Mantra: "Namu Myoho-Renge Kyo." She came from Nakarama She was a real good dancer She lived here many years ago She found a kitten And ran away with it. Who knows where? What are you to her? Try the students. Buy my dolls. Dolls. 500 yen. Show one to them. Ehime dolls. A real bargain. Give them to your girls. How about 10 yen. It's cheap. Pretty, isn't it? Local specialty. Not buying? Next time? Buy next time. Good. I'll keep two for you. Know Emperors? I saw the stickers. Where? Where from? Mitaka. I know the town. A suburb of Tokyo. Right? No Emperors there. Not in Mikata. But I saw it. Who was it? Really? Buy the sticker. I have one, sorry. The sticker? Buy one, won't you? Buy dolls. 500 yen. 1,000 yen. How about coffee? You got 80 tickets. Where are the rest? 43 tickets? You sold them? Then give me the money. I said to pay by the 20th. Not the 24th? You kidding? What did Sato tell you? You wanted me. Why didn't you see me the next day? I waited until after midnight. You could come in the evening. How could you ignore me? Even if I'm patient, that's too much. You should be angry. You made a promise with Decko and later broke it. How many times do I have to tell you? I beat you up many times because you didn't keep your promises. You didn't phone me. You only think about yourself. You're selfish. You never keep our rules. You collect money from members but where is it? You used it for yourself. You know you can't pay it all at once. Sometimes you can't even play a thousand yen. You should be more careful when you do something. You need more effort. Try your best and you'll find a way. You aren't trying hard enough. I have something to do. Let me go home. Damn you! When will you talk? I got 40 tickets. Forty? You said seven before. What a liar! What did you do with them? You didn't eat them. Speak up! Tell the truth! You didn't tell me anything! Anything I really want to know. All right. Forget the forty tickets. You don't have them and you don't know where they are. You don't know what happened to them. They're your responsibility. Give me the money tomorrow. "I was asked if I went to get my driver's license." "I said yes. I lied." "Then I was asked if I get it." "I lied again." Is that all? It isn't any better. Are you serious? Don't laugh when you lie. Look serious. Act seriously. Look serious. "I spent 40 yen for the paper" "but I lied that it was 50 yen." "But they soon found out." "I spent 40 yen..." Not that way. Look down, like the insurance solicitor on TV. Look depressed like him. Act like that. "I asked if I went..." Good! Act like that! "I was asked if I went to get my driver's license." "I said yes. I lied." "Then I was asked if I got it. I lied again." "I spent 40 yen for the paper." "But I lied that it was 50 yen." "But they soon found out." You were brave that time. Terrific! You amazed me. What will you do? From now on... "From now on?" "First:" "I won't tell lies." "I won't tell lies." "Second?" "You haven't reformed." "Is that all?" "Reform quickly." "Tell me what you'll do from now on." "No lies. Is that all?" "I didn't know how to respect my seniors." Don't grin. "I'll be careful." "Is that all?" I can't do anything if I attended the meeting..." To attend a meeting doesn't matter. "If I cant attend it, I'll phone you." Nobody cares if you come or go. But you can't just ignore the meeting. "I'll sum the bills after the meeting." And? What else? You don't have to respect your seniors if they're bad. Izumi was grabbed by the hair. He was hit and screamed. He was acting. I tried hard not to laugh. That was nothing. Inside the apartment, they hit me harder. It wasn't punishment. They hit me... as if I was their enemy. They meant it. Fighting from the start. They treated me real bad. Like this. Like this. I got mad. They kicked me. It didn't hurt. I could protect myself. If it were punishment, I would have let them have their way. But it wasn't. I wasn't scared. I was thinking about my girl. We were planning to escape when we got out of the car. But they grabbed him quickly. We couldn't escape. I thought they would get me next. Then Cook yelled, "Gomu!" I hurriedly said, "Yes, sir!" He said,"You're lying about the hospital. I said, "It's true.". You lied again! He said, "I'd kill you if you were older." "Go to the Hanaya. Yoshiki will beat you." I escaped. I apologized to Decko, but I won't to Yoshiki. Absolutely not. Where's Gomu? He isn't here. Where is he? Forget him. A smoke. Why didn't you come? No time for smoking. I could beat you again. I'm with Yanagimachi. What's your complaint? I'm not complaining. You aren't? Then why are you here? I hate beating. But you deserve it. Don't you know why? I deserve punishment, but... You weren't punished. Your face isn't deformed. It was. You said you didn't punish me enough. I wasn't convinced. You beat me hard enough. You weren't convinced. You mean I was wrong? It wasn't punishment. You mean it was? How old are you? You don't like the way I control our group? It's not that. It wasn't punishment, huh? It was just a beating. You deserved punishment. You deserved a beating. If you walk out on us, submit your resignation. A beating is a matter between you and me. If you want to quit, tell Endo. I'm not sure. What is it? What do you dislike? Nothing. Why? Why quit? Because... I prefer playing as an individual, not as a group. That's why. Why did you join us? You enjoyed riding with us. If you quit, there's a way. Endo will treat you. Don't escape. You promised Decko that you'd come, but you broke it. You don't like a beating? You've been spoiled. Don't try to lick me. What did you say about me? Come here, Gomu. Do you think you can just quit anytime? Freely? No, but... I have my own idea. Cook is trying to settle your problem. But you offended him. Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you? I was scared. That explains nothing. Why scared? Why do I yell at you? Why do I have to tell you this? Why? Because I got you in trouble. You didn't. I'm not in trouble. Why do I have to yell at you? Tell me. You don't know. Damn you! That's life. You look like a crybaby. I won't forgive you. I don't want to bother you. You're like a baby. But you're a liar. I don't want to waste my time on a kid like you. What's ailing you? We teased you at the Hanaya. But we didn't mean it. We were joking. Maybe it was a serious problem for you. You'd have quit the next day. But why now? Is somebody trying to make you quit? Is somebody threatening you? Or some trouble? Why do you want to quit? Are you tired? I'm tired. And the money. I don't work, so I'm broke. Why not come to me? Why not ask me? You think I hate you? You think I do, huh? No. Why not tell me? Why not? If you can't come, there's somebody else who can do the job for you. I can do it. There are many others. But if you don't tell us, how are we supposed to know? Who can help you? I wanted to ask you, but you didn't come. If you tell me you can't come, I can cover for you. I can settle it. But you neither called me, nor came to the Hanaya. You want to stay with Gomu: You don't want me anymore. Right? No. Yamagimachi, give me a cup of coffee. I think these punks want to quit our group. Tell them. Nothing to say. Preaching is your business, not mine. This isn't the first time my members betrayed me. We don't need them. You quit? You're free to quit, but you should say hello to me. You're stupid. I won't yell at you. As I said, it's Cook's business. I know what you want to say. Cook is good natured. He'll seriously ask you why you didn't come to the Hanaya. And you'll make personal excuses. But I know they're lies. You have time to come to Yanagimachi's place. When you want to have fun. You go out, even if your mom tries to stop you. If you wanted to come to Hanaya, you could come. You want to have fun. You must share hardship. Cook is angry, but in his heart, Teachers and cops preach. They waste their time. The punks don't try to understand. They'll laugh when they're alone, "Gee, it was long." "Endo appeared, too." "He was an extra." "He isn't smart." Gomu thinks so. Gomu is a real con man. He's an actor. He pretends he's crying. He wets his eyes quickly. He looks at me, as if pleading, "Don't kill me." He looks pitiful. He's young- I don't want to be mad. But, in his mind, he must be thinking his acting worked. That makes me mad. I hate dishonesty and pretense. "Maxie, that's your nickname." Gomu is mine. "Maxie, you're stupid." So am I. "Maxie, you once had a dream, didn't you?" Dream. “Mane, amass money.“ "Make a huge building in Aoyama." "Gather funny people." "Build a castle of freedom." Smoke. "Maxie, I'm working hard." "Maxie, a little birdie told me." "Maxie, why did you kill yourself?" "Maxie, you took a hundred sleeping pills." "You walked alone to Shibuya." "You fell on the slope under a neon sign." "You were stupid." "You died a fool." "Maxie, I'll take to the road tomorrow." "Maxie, it's not because of you." “Mane, 1 can't go as far as you are.“ "I travel alone. That's my life." I have fun on Saturday nights. Let's go to the rally. I like rallies. I like porno pix. Let me join you. No. Oil's burning. I don't know what to do. Rough riders symbolize youth. It's sad. I could cry. I'll freak on the lawn. I'm a Black Emperor now. Never mind the fuzz. If you can't become a rough rider, you'll be a dropout.
