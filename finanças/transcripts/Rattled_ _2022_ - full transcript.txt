Oh, shit! Okay. - Still alive? - I'm not sure. - I think it's your lucky day, Woolf. - Oh, yeah? How's that? Someone posted your bail. Somebody post bail for me too? Ha! Come on, brah. Come on!

Maybe like a coffee or, um... Well, maybe you need something stronger than a donut? You know where to get any of that, um, um... Cotton candy? Cotton candy will cost ya. All right then. Cotton candy. You're a godsend. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. - Oh, no, no. This is not happening. - This is happening.

Just, look, I g-I g-I can't, okay? He'll kill me, then he'll kill you. Put your hands behind your back. Fyodor Grimm. He runs all this. I pulled you from this case. - You directly disobeyed an order. - Nobody else is going after Fyodor. I know what he did to your partner, but you can't bring Bradbury back. There are procedures here. You can't just come marching in here with your bodycam footage and expect a conviction. Plus, if you go after Fyodor without backup, he's probably gonna kill you too. And if I don't take him down, he's gonna murder other people. This whole place is just a big circle jerk. Watch your mouth. Y'know, I'm this close to putting you back on traffic duty. Really? You'd demote me for trying to catch a drug lord? No, I'd demote you for disobeying orders! Fine! Then either demote me or let me do my job, because I will tell you what, I'm gonna get him with or without the badge, and with or without your permission. My shit. Goddamn millennials. Hey, take you for a ride, cutie? - You already did. - Hey, hey. Don't fuckin' touch me. Give me that shit. What? You know out of jail, it ain't cool to stare at someone like you want that butt sex, right, brah? What, man? Yo, what are you doin'? Come on, I'm on probation, man. Don't do that. That's not my fault you couldn't outrun the cops. What's your problem, man? "Goose The Bounty Hunter." That shit is fuckin' hilarious. You think you can take my business? Huh? I was just watchin' it for you, man. That's what friends do. All right, friend. When were you gonna tell me? I just did. You owe me fifty percent of what you made. The fuck outta here. That's not fair. - Fifty-one percent. How 'bout that?! - Fifty-one percent of what? I didn't even make a cent. I don't even got no money, brah. - All right, I'll take your car. - Brah, you ain't takin' shit. - Yeah, I am, man. Give me the key. - You ain't takin' shit, brah, man. Gimme the fuckin' keys, man. I'll piss all over this motherfucker. Give me the keys. Give me the keys! - I'll piss all over... - Put your fuckin' baby dick away, brah. That's right. Relax. Relax, man. Shit. You know what? I'mma give you your money. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, I wanna be paid in full. - I fuckin' heard you. Give me the hot dog. Leave those gloves on. Open the register nice and slow. Are you kiddin' me? You just don't stop. - You just don't quit it. - Ah. Chill, brah. - Keep pushing and pushing. - Shut the fuck up, brah. Are you holding me up at knifepoint? Do it. Oh. - Oh, wow. - Uh-huh. You want me to fuck you up? I said do it. That too. Ah. It's not for me. It's for him. Dude, you're a fuckin' lunatic, man. - Yeah, what? - Don't "what" me. If you ever "what" me again, I'll cut your dick off and shove it down your throat. Fyodor, what a surprise. Uh, how'd you know I was out? Who do you think posted your bail, asshole? I have a job for you. Ah, man. You know I'm on probation right now. Dude, get in the fuckin' car. It will be the easiest grab you've ever done. It pays a hundred grand. A hundred G's? Yeah, I could do that. I would hope so. Stand by. I'll have someone drop you a bag with the details. All right. - Did you just say a hundred grand, brah? - Yo, you're gonna do a job for me. - It sounds like a big ass job. - Yeah, you know Fyodor Grimm? Fyodor Grimm was the biggest gangster in Vegas before he hit puberty. Fuck. Yeah, I heard the name. Yeah, he got a big ass bounty on his head, right? - I get to bring him in? - Psh. Good luck with that. Bring him in? He just hired us to grab someone. Hundred grand! Oh! Drive! Drive! Drive! Get out of here! Come on! Go! Stay sharp and no fuckin' around. That means no fuckin' around of any kind. No gambling. Can't have you all stressed about not getting royal flush or lining up a bunch of cherries in a row. And no drinking. Booze makes you crazy. You're already a madman. Look, you're gonna meet someone by the shark tank at the aquarium. They're gonna have instructions for you. - Who am I supposed to meet? - I don't know, but it's important that you're there on time and you look good. I look good. Look, if anyone asks if you're Woolf, you just say, "No, I could never be Woolf." "But I was sent here on behalf of Woolf." You say that, all right? - Yeah, I'll tell them that. - You can do this shit? - I can do this shit. - And we get paid, bro. - All right. - Let's go. All right, man. - Okay. - Yeah, see ya later, my boy. Ah, fuck! Gimme, gimme, gimme. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Gimme, gimme, gimme. - Are you the Woolf? - No. Oh. Wait, wait. Oh, man. Oh, boy. If anyone asks if you're Woolf, you just say, "Nah, I could never be Woolf, but I was sent here on behalf of Woolf." I'm here for half of Woolf. Hmm. Then I guess this is for you. Aren't you a little young to be doing this? Where's your boss? Who says I'm not the boss? Look at that shark. Cool. Fish. I'm leaving. Sharks don't need eyes to hunt. - What do you mean? - Sharks can smell prey. They can smell blood in the water and sense vibrations. Pulses. They'll hunt you down and chew you up into tiny little pieces. Sharks don't hunt people, dumb dumb. Ow! - Ooh! Ooh, you little demon. - You're bleeding. Now if a shark smells you, you're gonna die. We're all gonna die, dumb dumb. And if a shark bit me, - I'd stab it in the eyeball. - Cool knife. - Give it. - Heck, no. Get lost. I hope you're a good swimmer. Shit, man. Sodium Pentothal? Ooh. Okay. "Grab drug and bring me that bitch in one piece. Five-oh-six Paradise Road." Hey, Harper. I thought you were locked up? You see, I was, you know, but I, I got caught up in this little thing, but it really wasn't my fault, you know? I was trying to get ahold of you the whole time. I fucked up. You want something to wet your whistle? Yeah, what'chu thinking? - Something smooth. - Yeah. What'chu got in mind? What are you thinking? Something smooth? - Nice bling, bro. - Oh, thank you very much. - Um, you're here for guidance? - No. - No, where's your brother? - Oh, he, he eloped and moved to Florida. Crazy guy. But I would love to chat. You want to come in? - You need me to look out for you? - No. Just need you to be look out for just an hour today. Yeah? Just make sure there's no mistakes. It's so funny. I buy a priest robe... For the wages of sin is death. ...and one week later, I have a mission. It's not a mission, brah. It's just a job. Not to me. I am going to be the best look out you can imagine. You are in good hands. - What's the mission? - Uh, I just gotta grab a guy. Oh. - Is he a bad guy? - Yeah. Yeah, they're all bad guys. And you might say that by grabbing him, we're saving people. Saving people... But you need to provide a location for the drop. Hmm? My mom's out of town. We can do it here. We just have to keep it really clean. Yeah. - Yeah. It'll do. - Ah. Can I ask my mom first? No, you can't ask your fucking m- Fuck, bro. You know what? Forget it. Yeah, this is not gonna work. I need to find somebody else anyway. I need someone who can handle a fuckin' gun. Wait! Would a sniper be okay? A sniper would be fuckin' great. Why, you know a sniper? He's killed a lot of people. I don't know if it's okay. What's his name? Steven. But we call him King. Holy shit! Three tours in 'Nam and you think I'm gonna die in bed? Oh, fuck off! I just want to be prepared. This priest shit's gonna be the end of me. - God, forgive him. Rest in peace. - Eliot! King Steven. Yeah, that's a strong name. All right, well, can you get ahold of King now? Yeah. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Okay. Shit... Okay. Yeah. Yes, baby. Fuck, yes. Salud. What the fuck is this shit? This is Rabst? What, you picked this up at the Dollar Store? - Yeah. - Yeah? You got cheap taste or something? Only in men. Yo, how come you didn't answer any of my calls? I can't take calls from jail. Chief is already on my ass. Lucky guy. How'd you get out? - I dug a tunnel. - Sounds tight. - I barely fit. - Okay. You got the whole day off? Ooh. That must be that bitch's room right there. Stay alert, okay? If you see any weird shit popping off, you let me know. Listen, if anything happens to me, I want you to have my bling. Nothing's gonna happen to you, all right? Well, is this the mission? - No, the Homeless Mission's that way... - Oh, uh, it's... ...so keep scooting along. Uh, we're busy. - What... - Goose, um, this is King. This is King? - The sniper from the war? - Uh-huh. I thought you meant Iraq, not the American Revolution. It was 'Nam, you son of a bitch. Wait, is... Is this your grandpa? - Well, at least you brought your weapon. - Roger that. - An M1 Carbine. - Don't point that shit at me, man! Relax, princess. I got the safety on. - No the fuck you don't. - Huh? Oh, shit. Yeah. It's on now. Put on your mask. - Yo, you can walk? - Of course. - Well, why the fuck you got a scooter? - Why not? I can give you a million reasons why not. It's slow, it's ugly, it's loud, and he it can get us busted. Damn! All right, I'mma kick this shit down, man. No, no! Wait! Check and see if there's a key. See it? Yeah! Holy shit! Who's that? It's the bitch. What? Get him. Fall back! Fall back! Get in there, ya bastard. That's enough, you bastard! No! Don't shoot! I can pick him off! Oh, shit. I'm gonna shoot him in the chest. Hold your shot! - I, I, I can pick him off! - Don't fuckin' shoot! Hold your shot! - I can't hold it! - Hold your shot! - I can't! - Hold your shot! - I can't hold it much longer! - Hold your shot! - Oh, God. - Oh, God! - Oh, God. - God, please help us right now. - I'm gonna shoot! - No. The syringe. Oh, God! I found it! Got you, bitch. You know, how 'bout we just run away together? We'll go to some island somewhere, we could hunt our own food, walk around naked all day. I can't. I'm too tied up with work. Yeah, bitch. Let's get this motherfucker to the car. Um, do you need some help? Yeah, gimme a fucking hand, brah. You ready? Yeah. Ain't so tough now, are you big guy? You said Woolf is coming for the trade-off right? You know, I was just thinking, maybe Woolf is late. No shit, dumb ass. Of course he's late. Look around. He's the only one not here. You think maybe he got detained? - Got detained by cops? - Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Maybe he ran out on us. - Woolf wouldn't do that. - How the fuck do you know? You don't know Woolf like I do. I think he's gone... which, which means I'm the boss now. No offense, but uh, with all with all due respect, fall in line or I'll make you fall in line. Oh, yeah? You and what army? Hey, hey. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. We're, we're on the same team. The Bible clearly says... Uh, stop! I don't want to hear shit about that book. - Well, I think it'll help. - Trust me, it's not gonna help. Sometimes if you're feeling confused, the scriptures will lead you to a clearer outlook. I'm not confused. Not one bit. I just want to get this job finished, get my cut, and just be on my way. Well, it was only an idea. Okay, well, you can take your little idea and just shove it right up your ass, brah. Excuse me. Are you saying that you don't believe in The Bible? No, I'm saying I don't want to make this into a bible study, Eliot. You better believe in The Bible. Okay. Now I'm saying I don't believe in The Bible. - That's so immoral. - Bro, you know we just kidnapped somebody, right? Yeah, but we did that to save people. How can you not believe in God? God hasn't exactly believed in me in the last thirty years, so I just thought I'd return the favor. I can see that you're struggling, Goose, but if you put your faith in the Lord... It's not gonna happen. I hope you're praying for this guy right here because I'm over this shit. You wouldn't. Our mission is to keep him alive. I killed forty-seven people in 'Nam and two more in Texas just for fun. I wouldn't be afraid to make you number fifty. You'd just be another notch on my belt. Now put that pathetic knife away. - You're full of shit. - Come again? You wouldn't shoot me in your daughter's house. You'll have to speak up. Boy, you're pissing me off, old man. I'm fixing to whoop your ass. Damn! My hearing aid's gone out. - What? - What? What's that? - Are you fucking with me right now? - Come again? Uh, wait. Yeah, tha-th-that's better. Now, what were you saying? Well, forget it, brah. Tell me if I'm too loud. Oh, you're, you're, you're, you're breaking up again. - No, no, no, that's... - What? That's not Goose. Yeah, this guy can't breathe. He can breathe just fine. Your nose holes work, don't they? Grandpa, go check who it is. I'll check because I'm curious. - I'm going to take his gag off. - Don't you dare. We need him quiet. I'm going to take out your gag so you can breathe. Promise to be quiet? - Who is it? - It's Woolf. Who? Come on, it's Woolf, bro. It's Woolf. Open up. See? Thank you for cooperating. - Help! - Hey. - Help! - Hey! Shh! Help! Yo, I'm, I'm trying to help. Man, open the door! Come on! - Help! - Shut up! Would you shut up? I'm trying to figure out who's at the door. You're-You're making a big mistake. No, you're making a big mistake. We told you to be quiet. You want to scream? I'll give you a reason to scream. You mo-Argh! It's Woolf! - Ha! Are you still there? - Yeah! - What's the secret knock? - Open the fuckin' door. Goddamn hearing aid. ...my mouth. You... All right, motherfucker, I'mma cut out your tongue. No! No! No! Let's go! No! We're supposed to keep him in one piece! It'll be two pieces. Close enough! - Do it again. - Come on! It's me! Yo, open the door. I, I'm gonna need the secret knock loud and clear. - Stop it! Stop it! - Get off me! You think you can fuck with me? No, no, no, no, no. No, tha-that's the old secret knock. We, we changed it this morning. What the fuck are you talking about? This is the knock! - What is it with all this biting?! - Oh, mama. You fuck. Yeah! No, no, no. That's totally wrong. Yo, listen up, asshole. I am Woolf, okay? That's me. - Woolf! - I'm the one in charge of this whole fucking thing. Open the goddamn door. Let's go! - Why didn't you say so? - What do you mean? Who did you think was at the goddamn door? - Wait, who the hell are you? - King! - Yo, Goose! - Ha! Who am I? There we go! There we go! Wow. Hey, yo! Goose! Some old guy's at the door, man. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - Yo, you know who that is? - We got our mark. You idiots! You seem upset, brah. Yeah, that right there's Fyodor Grimm! - Who?! - Fyodor Grimm! - This is the guy who hired us! - Oh, shit! Fyodor. Hey, man. Look, I'm really fuckin' sorry. I don't know how this happened, but we're gonna fix it, okay? The most important thing is that you're all right. Are you oka-You all right? Right? But you're all right, right? You don't need to kill any of us or none of that crazy shit, right? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? - No, he's got his tongue. - What? Yo, why are you all covered in blood? God! Oh, whoa, whoa! What the fuck is that? - You cut out his tongue?! - Motherfucker bit me, bro. Yeah? Before or after you stuck a knife in his mouth? During. Fuck! Fuck! You motherfuckin' fuck motherfucker! Holy fuck! Okay. I mean, we can fix this shit, right? We can do this. Get the tongue. - Find the tongue, get some ice going. - What does it look like? It's pink. It's about an inch long and it speaks with an accent. What the fuck do you mean what does it look like? I've never seen a tongue not attached to a body, so kill me. Ah, shit. Well... Just find the thing! Please, find the tongue. No. - It's not here. - Fuck... - Oh, God. - What? It's attached to your shoe. Oh, what do you know? Oh, that's disgusting. You think you can do something with this? Oh, shit. How does that even happen, man? And why'd you cut his tongue out for? What's the matter with you? Why do you do this? All right, let me see the kidnapping instructions. The kidnapping instructions... - ...are in the bag. - Then bring me the bag. Um... - We don't have the bag. - Who was in charge of the bag? - Uh, well, that, that would be me. - So where's the bag? I have no clue. I don't know everything, okay? Well, you better think fast, my boy. Okay. Okay. Okay! I remember. It's on the floor of the house that we grabbed him at. You left the bag on the floor of the house that you grabbed him at? - What? - Nothing. Why'd you just say, "Uh-oh"? - No. No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. I heard you. No reason. No, there's a reason because you said it. - It's my wallet. - Hey, what about your wallet? It might be in the bag. So you left the bag and your wallet? What's the address on your I.D.? Technically, I still live with my mom. So your lost I.D. has the address of the house that we're sitting in right now? It's perfect. What, you think it's fuckin' funny, man? This ain't no joke to me! Well, it, it seems like my looking out is done here, so if it's all the same to you, I think that you should take this gentleman out of my home, and I will begin cleaning up. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Sit your ass down. We ain't goin' anywhere until we figure this shit out. Get up. Yeah. Ah, jeez. Yeah. I'll go get the bag. You better wipe all that blood off your grill. You walk out the door like that, you're gonna get us all arrested. Relax. You can count on me... which is more than I can say for some people. Did he mean me? Do you, do you think he was talking about me? Yo, put him in the bedroom. What? That's where my mother sleeps. You think I give a shit? Yo, King, give me a hand. Come on, help me out, King. Come on, man. All right. Okay. Oh, boy. I don't understand how the hell you guys end up grabbing Fyodor. - I don't remember. - Well, you better start remembering 'cause I guarantee you right now, there's a pack of wild Russians looking for him, and when they don't find him, they're gonna come... What happened? - That was an accident. - I'll clean up! Go on. Well, um, he started to get free. I had to think fast, so I took my gun and I said, "Buddy, you move one inch, and I'm gonna put a bullet right between your eyes." Then he moved. - You shot him in the head? - No. I missed. - Oh, thank God. - I shot him in the gut. Fuck me! - Bad? - Well, it ain't good. - Oh, shit. - There's blood everywhere. It's, uh, it's on the carpet, on the walls. My mother is gonna kill me. Hey, we, we gotta stop the bleeding. Is there a, a, a, a first aid kid? - Yeah. - I think we have Band-Aids. - Band-Aids? We need a tourniquet! - Hey, hey, yo, the curtains! Oh, yeah. No, not the curtains! Mother loves those curtains more than she loves me. - Help me take 'em down. - Wait! Wait! They're the only thing hiding us from the outside world. Ah! Yeah. Hey, how about the sheets? We can rip 'em up and use them as a tourniquet, huh? Grandpa, please. Those sheets are Egyptian cotton. - Sit there. - And do what? You don't do shit. You just sit there. You don't think, you don't speak, you don't breathe until I come back. You got it? Shit... What the fuck? Oh, shit. Come on. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Freeze! Put my beer down. Put your hands behind your back slowly. Get down on your knees. Son of a bitch. I'm taking you in. Don't move. Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Get out of the car. I'm commandeering the vehicle. - Oh, right. Are you even a cop? - Yes, Detective Harper Anderson. Do you have your badge on you? - Get out! - I'm not gettin' out! I'll get over, but I'm not gettin' out. What the hell is this? You don't know how to drive stick? Just tell me quick! Okay, this here is a two thousand sixteen GMC Sierra SLT. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on. I'm telling you that 'cause you gotta be careful with her. How do I make it move? Okay, you got three pedals down there. Your gas, your brake and your clutch. Oh, for fuck sake, he's getting away! Do you want to learn manual or not? - Tell me faster. - Okay. Put your foot on the brake and the clutch and I'll shift for ya. Now what? Take your feet off the pedals and push on the gas. What happened? You gotta do it slowly. Okay. Okay, good. Whoa. Good. Now let's shift her into second. - How do I do that? - Take your foot off the gas, push in the clutch. Okay. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy on her. Okay, there you go. Now you got it! Come on, girl. Let's take her into third. Easy! Easy with her. Easy, easy. Come on! Okay, open her up a little bit. Let's get her into third. Gotcha. Okay. Whoo-hoo! There you go! She likes this. Okay, let's go! Get that boy! You're going down! Fuck! - Hell, yeah! She made for that! - Yeah! It's a lot harder than it looks. Cops have insurance, right? You want to tell me what happened? Can you drive stick? Brandishing a weapon out of uniform, commandeering a vehicle and crashing it... I shoulda taken your badge earlier. I was in hot pursuit. The guy broke into my house and I know he was gonna lead me to Fyodor. - Fyodor isn't your concern. - Fyodor will always be my concern. You're suspended till further notice. Take some time and get your head right. My head is right. Here we have protocols and procedures to prevent the kind of clusterfuck you caused today. Get out of town. Go to Sedona. It'll be good for ya. I'm gonna need to get that back. I can't take this silence. I gotta get outta here. No. No. God called you here. Why? Why did you call me here? He cut out his tongue! But he was a bad guy Help. Help. Help. Woolf! Woolf! Woolf! Woolf! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What'd I tell you, man? I said not a word. Someone was knocking. Well, I don't hear nothin'. - Well, it just stopped. - Was it "Shave and a Haircut"? I don't think so. It had to be Goose, right? Shit. Well, it better be Goose. Goose? Goose? Goose? - Goose? - Goose? Are you out there? Because this is not funny. Goose? Goose! The couch! I just almost died for your bag, and you want to complain about the couch? - Yo, Goose with the bag! Here we go! - Oh, shit. Oh, bro. Your arm is mangled. Hey, why you come through the window? Ugh, I knocked three times just like we rehearsed and no one came. All right, man. You get the- You got the wallet in here? - Hey, where's the wallet? - It's gotta be in there. - It better be in there. - Man, I don't see it. If someone finds that wallet, it's gonna lead 'em straight to us. - Wallet? I found a wallet. - Okay, King. What? What the fuck? - No, this isn't mine. - What? What? Let me see. - Where'd you get this? - Uh, it was in our mark's back pocket. Anton Grimm. - I mean, this looks exactly like Fyodor. - Maybe they're brothers. Twins. - Yes! This is good news! - Are you shittin' me? Fyodor is on his way here right now. Instead of having whoever we were supposed to grab, we got his dead twin brother. You fucking kidding me? How is that good news? - Well, I guess I was just hoping it was. - Fuck. Hoping... He's hoping it was. Wow. Do you have any kind of painkillers, man? - Yes, we probably have aspirin. - I need morphine. Shit. Here you go. Pills. Ginko Biloba? What the fuck is this? Well, you know, it might not help with the pain, - but it should improve your memory. - Are you kidding? The last thing I want to do is remember today any better. We gotta get rid of that body. Uh, we'll dump him in a lake. You got a boat? Do I look like I got a boat? Well, we'll put him in the trunk and figure out what to do along the way. How are you gonna move his body out of here? Well, we'll, we'll roll him up and... Ah, a rug! Here. - Give me a hand. - All right, let's do it. Ah, that's the secret knock. It must be Fyodor. I only told you two about the secret knock. That's the way everybody knocks. Well, maybe it's not him then. - Open the door! I can hear you! - Let me handle this. - Yo, get our money. - Open the fuckin' door! I know you're in there. Open the fuckin' door! Open the door, asshole! I said, asshole, open the fucking door! Hey, buddy. Asshole. You've been standing in the middle of the room. You have any idea how long I was outside? Something's off, huh? - Nah, no, everything is on. On. - Who is hiding behind the curtain? Nobody. - You! - Who, me? Over here. Now! You got something to say? Huh? You were supposed to be the only one here. - You and the bitch. - The bitch? What bitch? Not that bitch. The bitch I hired you to kidnap. Where is she? Oh! Yeah, the girl! - Yeah. - Yeah. Where is she? - Uh, on her way. - On her way? - Yeah. - Where? - Here. - When? - Uh, right now. - Now? Yeah. - You're kidding. - She's coming. What happened? Uh, I was just explaining to Fyodor here about the girl, you know, how we got her and she's on her way over here and all that. What girl? Come on, man. What are you gonna do with that gun? Were my instructions not clear enough or you? I think they were very clear. - You think? - What were the instructions again? You see, uh, El-Eliot must still be a little bit lightheaded from passing out, you know? He don't remember. - I'm hungry. - He's a specialist. Never eats on the job. Go on, man. Get some food. You earned it. Go ahead. I mean, he doesn't look the part, but trust me, he's a true fuckin' animal, this guy. Mad man. I know he doesn't look like it, but he is. Fyodor. She's gonna be here in five minutes, bro. I'll give you four. - What is that? - Oh, shit! Let me see it. - Hey, throw that thing out! - Hey! Stop! Stop! - You never know what kind of, - Stop! - Uh, meat ends up in fast food, right? - Stop! - That's why I don't eat this shit. - Hey! Stop! You almost shredded my hand. - Want more, huh? Want more? - Stop, put it down! Put it- - Want more? - Man, you win! You win the fight! You win. You just punched me in the face. It was a good punch. Eliot, let's get a drink going. Let's celebrate. How 'bout that? You've been training, haven't you, you dirty dog, you. - What do you want? - Whatever we got. Hell of a punch, Fyodor, holy shit. - Orange juice, skim milk, soda water? - Nah, nah, nah. Liquor! We need a manly drink for this guy, you kidding me? I don't think we have any. We go through the booze pretty quick around here. - We like to knock 'em back. - Oh, that explains a lot, huh? - Yeah. - Yep, we're clean out. Polished off the rest of the sauce this afternoon, remember? - Yes! Mom's hidden vodka! - Look at that! How 'bout that? How can I trust somebody who hides vodka, huh? Well, you can trust us. You can trust us, Fyodor. You can trust us. Let's have a drink. Let's have a drink, boss. Okay? Get him a nice shot. Okay, coming! Got the drinks! - This is your drink. - Ah! Here we go. - And this is your drink. - No, this is my drink. This one's for you. I don't drink. What do you mean, you don't drink? I just don't drink. I've never had a drink in my life. Woolf said you spent afternoon drinking. - Why would you say that? - 'Cause it's true, you fuckin' idiot. I don't trust people who don't drink. Now, kill the drink or I'll kill you both. Doesn't that hit the spot? What's that? - What's what? - That. Oh, that? That's, uh, yeah, yeah. I punched the wall. Hey, Eliot, you wanna get me one of them... I think I'm gonna be sick. Hey, El? - You promise to be quiet? - Yeah. Yeah. El? Yo, Eliot! What's up? That's disgusting. Hey, man. I, I, I was just wondering if you could grab me a Band-Aid for my hand. I think I punched the wall too hard. Oh. That blood isn't from punching the wall. That blood is from the guy we found at the house. I knocked him out with my head. Guy? What guy? - Where is this guy? - Oh, he's in the bedroom. - Bring me that motherfucker! - Okay. Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah. Hey, yo, yo, yo. That motherfucker, I'll get him. Get that off your shirt. It makes me sick. Get rid of it. - What are you...? - Here he is. The motherfucker. You're the guy? You're a cop? Tell me you're a cop. That would be perfect. Really? You're a cop? You're definitely a cop. You Harper's new partner? You know what happened to her last one? What happened to her last partner? Let's just say I smell blood in the water. What did the bitch tell on me, huh? You think your balls hurt now, wait till I cut them off. You think you can fuck with my plans? Son of a bitch. Good idea. Do it. - No. - Do it. Now. Do it. If I make it out of this, I'm gonna fuck you up. Do it! Fuck. So, you got the bag? Where is it? Just go get your grandpa... Tie him up. Tie him up. This guy's a cop, man, I don't think we should kill him. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Tie him up. Ah, boy. Shit. Just don't move, motherfucker. Stay there. Come on, come on, come on. Spit it out, spit it out, spit it out. Okay, let's look at him. - Yep, he's good. - Where's Harper? Mister Fyodor, please meet another man of your caliber, Mister King. This guy is my caliber? What'd he say? Yeah, damn hearing aid. What's that? Uh, uh, uh, one more time. Hearing aid? Huh? Okay, n-nice and slow. Nice and slow. I said, "Hearing aid?" Come again? - Unbelievable. - One more time. I am going to fuck you up, you fucking asshole! What's that? You're gonna fuck us up our assholes? - Unbelievable. - You commie pervert! Oh, shit. Ah, wait. - I've seen enough. - Wait, wait. I'm not a cop. No. - No, no, no. - No, no, no. - Yo. Yo, Fyodor. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Open it. Stop right there! Do him. - I suggest you step back. - Shoot him. Shoot his ass. Shoot him. Shoot him in his ass. You shot me. Eliot, no. Oh, El-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! It's all good. Now I've got my own war story. You're not really a, a cop, are you? Oh, Fyodor. Hey, man. I'm really sorry that we killed your twin brother. We all feel terrible about it. How do you know I have a twin brother? I love you, Grandpa. Tell Mom I'm sorry about the mess. There you are, God. Thank you. I'm coming. No... no... - Where's my brother? - I don't know. - Where's my brother? Where's my brother? - I don't know. I don't know. Fifty-one. - Motherfucker, where's my brother? - I don't fuckin know. - Where's my brother?! - I don't know, man. Fifty-two. I'm such a bad shot. Where's my brother?! Where is he? Yeah, I, I remember. I remember. The guy that they grabbed, he looked like you. Okay? They-I, I, I saw his I.D. and it said, "Anton Grimm". That hothead. I told him I'm gonna take care of Harper. Where's he? Uh, well, what do you want with Harper? Answer the question. Where is my brother? Where is Anton? He's in the back room. He's out there in the bedroom in the back. Hey, hey, hey. Wake up. Wake up. Come on. We're gonna get you. Wake up! Who killed him?! Oh, shit. This is for my brother. Tell him I said hello. Hello. - Hey, Woolf. - Shut up. Shut up. I gave you a hundred thousand dollars to kidnap her, and all you deliver is this fucking mess. Any last words? You tried to kidnap me? I love you. I love you too, man. This is so sweet. Close enough. This is for my partner! This is for me! And this is for everything else. What happened here? It's a war story. I think he's in a better place, and, uh, I'm not too sure about him, but he definitely went out doing what he loves. - Were you really trying to kidnap me? - Nah. Hell, no. I had no idea. Trust me. Look, if you want to arrest me, you can, but... Put your hands behind your back. Oh, shit. Actually, I lost my badge. Oh, shit. For real? - Let's get the hell out of here. - Could someone please untie me? That guy broke into my house. I'm leaving him here. This guy's good. He's with me. Yo, are you good? Hey, listen. I'm sorry, okay? Yeah. I'm still kicking your ass later. Thank you for everything. I got you into this shit. - Okay, you good? All right? - Yeah. All right. Aw, man. You dumb dumb. Oh, boy. You know, if they took your badge, that means you don't have to bring Fyodor to the station, right? We could take him in and collect the cash. Bounty on his head is half a mil. It ain't a bad idea. I need to get out this life, brah. Yo, if you want to write to us, man, we'll be in the tropics. I'm coming with you. Yeah. Maybe it's the neighbors. Maybe it's the cops. Maybe the twins have a triplet. Oh, man.
