MAY, HE BROKE THE KID'S NOSE WITH A HOCKEY STICK. THESE SPORTS ARE VERY DANGEROUS. I'M SURE IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. YEAH, WELL, I KNOW THEY WERE ON A GRASS FIELD. WHICH MEANS THEY WEREN'T EVEN PLAYING HOCKEY! HE'S NOT HERE. I FOUND THE SKATEBOARD I JUST BOUGHT HIM RUSTING IN THE LEAVES HE DIDN'T RAKE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LEAVES. I CARE ABOUT GOGAN. WE AGREED IF THIS EVER HAPPENED AGAIN, WE'D BE MORE... SERIOUS ABOUT HIS PUNISHMENT, REMEMBER? I'LL TALK TO HIM. HE'S MY BABY. HE'S NOT REALLY A BABY-- HE'S 13. HE'S NOT REALLY A BABY...

THAT'S WHY I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR SOME TOUGH LOVE. WHAT'S WRONG? YOUR BROTHER IS HERE. EVERYTHING OKAY? ALL RIGHT, HERE'S YOUR CULPRIT. MUST HAVE... MUST HAVE RUN IT OVER. THE STRING FROM GOGAN'S KITE. WE WERE LOOKING FOR THAT. SO, OTHER THAN HER KID, WHO ELSE? YOU SAID, "EVERYONE ELSE IS THE PROBLEM." NO, NEVER MIND. FORGET IT. LET'S JUST SAY SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT GUYS ARE LIKE OVER HERE. YEAH, EDGAR, WHAT ARE, UH, WHAT ARE GUYS LIKE OVER HERE? SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY. SHE LIKES TO HAVE FUN. A LOT OF GUYS SEE THAT AND THEY MISTAKE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS MAYLON'S NOT INTERESTED, WHAT DOES IT MATTER? WHO CARES? WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM ANYWAY? WHERE'S WHAT COMING FROM? YOUR SUDDEN CONCERN IN MY MARRIAGE. IT'S NO SECRET YOU DON'T LIKE HER. THAT'S NOT TRUE. OH, COME ON, YOU DON'T THINK... YOU THINK I DON'T REMEMBER THE "MAIL ORDER" COMMENTS? [WINCING IN PAIN] YOU OKAY? [DOOR OPENS] EDGAR, ARE YOU OKAY? NO, MY ULCER IS GOING BERSERK. I FEEL LIKE CRAP. I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN AND MARK SOME TESTS. DON'T LET ME MISS "THE FIFTH ESTATE"!

[DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN] [DOOR SWINGS SHUT] [WOMAN STANDING AT FRONT CRIES] [VOICE FROM TELEVISION]: WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? UM... THE PAIN IS GONE. [TELEVISION]: NO. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT WHAT YOU DID? WHAT DID I DO? WHAT... WHAT IS THIS PLACE? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? [TELEVISION]: FIND A CHAIR AND SIT DOWN. HOW DID I GET HERE? PLEASE SIT DOWN. IF I SIT DOWN, ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON? SIT DOWN. I WOULDN'T TAKE THAT ONE, BUDS. EXCUSE ME, MAY I? FUCK OFF... AND STAY FUCKED OFF. IT'S NO PROBLEM. I GET IT. SIT DOWN. WELL, DOES... SIT! VERY GOOD. LET'S CONTINUE THEN. GO ON, ISABEL. [WHISPERING] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? [ISABEL, SOBBING] I CAN'T ANYMORE... VERY WELL. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO NEXT? "UXOR?" WHAT IS THAT? WILLIAM! YOU'RE NEXT! AH, SHE MUST'VE BEEN FUCKING AROUND ON YOU. MINE TOO. I'M SORRY, WHAT? [CHAIR SCRAPING] MY NAME IS WILLIAM, AND I SLAUGHTERED BOTH OF MY PARENTS. [EVERYONE]: HI, WILLIAM. I'M SPREADING DEVILED HAM ONTO A ROLL, WHEN MY FATHER COMES IN AND ASKS ME, "HOW ARE THINGS GOING AT SCHOOL?" I SAY, "FINE." HE SAYS, "'FINE' ISN'T VERY DESCRIPTIVE." I SAY, "'HOW ARE THINGS?' ISN'T VERY EXPLICIT." HE TELLS ME NOT TO BE SMART WITH HIM, AND I... THRUST THE KNIFE INTO HIS THROAT. AND IT'S NOT SHARP, SO IT BARELY PIERCES HIS SKIN. HE'S... HOLDING HIS THROAT, GULPING FOR AIR. THE LOOK OF SHOCK IN HIS EYES ONLY LASTS FOR A SECOND. THEN IT'S ANGER. HE SAYS SOMETHING. I THINK IT'S, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" BUT I CAN'T BE SURE. SO I DRIVE THE KNIFE AGAIN, THIS TIME INTO HIS STOMACH. IT PENETRATES, HE FALLS TO THE GROUND. I STRADDLE HIS BODY, AND I START DIGGING INTO THE AREA BENEATH HIS RIB CAGE. I JUST GO. AFTER A WHILE, HE STOPS STRUGGLING, AND I'M TOO TIRED TO CONTINUE. HIS ENTIRE ABDOMEN LOOKED LIKE A SLOPPY, BLOODY HOLE. I LOOK UP, AND I SEE MY MOTHER STANDING IN THE DOORWAY. SHE ASKS THE SAME ODD QUESTION, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" AND THEN RUNS AWAY. I GET UP, CHASE HER, GRAB A JAR OF PICKLES ON THE WAY. I CATCH HER ON THE STAIRCASE, AND I SLAM THE JAR INTO THE BACK OF HER HEAD. I HIT HER THREE, MAYBE FOUR TIMES, UNTIL I KNOW HER SKULL IS COMPLETELY CRUSHED. SURPRISINGLY, THE JAR IS STILL INTACT, SO... I SIT THROUGH WHAT SEEMS LIKE YEARS, WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD BE FEELING, AND WHY I'M NOT FEELING IT. [CLEARS THROAT] [TELEVISION]: DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANYTHING NEW IN YOUR LAST EPISODE? YEAH, UM... I FOUND A TRAY OF CHERRY POPS IN THE BASEMENT FREEZER. THEY WEREN'T EVEN FULLY FROZEN YET. EVERY THANKSGIVING, I'D COME HOME, AND THEY WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME, BUT THAT WAS WHEN I WAS A KID. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, CLEARLY, MY MOTHER HAD SEEN THE CHANGES IN ME AND WANTED DESPERATELY TO HELP, WHICH IS CHARMING, YET PATHETIC AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY SHE KNEW HOW TO GET THROUGH TO ME WAS, UM... UH, FROZEN PUDDING. GOOD. VERY GOOD. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO NEXT? AH, YES, THE NEWCOMER. WHY DON'T YOU GO NEXT? UH, I DON'T EVEN-- COME RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT. OKAY. GOOD. STATE YOUR NAME. EDGAR. INTRODUCE YOURSELF, EDGAR, AND TELL US WHY YOU ARE HERE. UM... HI, MY NAME IS EDGAR, AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY I'M HERE. [EVERYONE] HI, EDGAR. OR EVEN WHERE HERE IS. AND... I WISH I COULD SAY THIS IS ALL A NIGHTMARE, BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT. SO... WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND TELL ME WHY I'M HERE? BECAUSE AS I SAID, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. GO TO DOOR 7734. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING-- DOOR 7734. WELL, FIRST, TELL ME WHAT'S IN THERE. 7734! WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T... SHE'S GOING TO RIP YOUR FUCKING NUTS OFF. SIT DOWN, JULIEN. WORD HAS IT SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED A PAIR OF HER OWN. JULIEN... COME ON, GIVE THE CHERRY A BREAK. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER, HUH? ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SEE? HE'S GOING. I TOLD YOU TO SIT DOWN, JULIEN.

SEE, I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT WE COULD WORK THIS OUT. I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE THREE OF US AS A FAMILY, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED. I SURRENDER. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YOU WON'T LET HER LEAVE. GOGAN, THIS IS YOUR MOTHER'S HOME. SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOUR UNCLE ON YOUR FATHER'S SIDE NEEDS HELP IN HIS FIELD. HE WANTS YOU BACK IN MINDERO. I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

YOU SAID, "I GET IT." I DON'T KNOW, OKAY? HOW OFTEN DO WE COME HERE? I NEED TO FIGURE THIS-- [WHISPERING] WHAT DID YOU MEAN? I DIDN'T HAVE A TON OF FRIENDS GROWING UP. EVENTUALLY, I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED THEM. AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THEM. I JUST HAD TO KEEP MY GUARD UP. RIGHT? YOU DON'T COME HERE. YOU NEVER LEAVE. I DIED IN 1972. THIS, AND WHAT'S THROUGH THAT DOOR, FROM NOW ON, THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER KNOW. WHAT'S THROUGH YOUR DOOR? JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T NECESSARY. YOU'LL BE LIKE THE REST OF THEM SOON ENOUGH, ANYWAY.

LET'S START BY GETTING INTO OUR DISCUSSION GROUPS AND... YES, WHAT IS IT? UM... THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE ERROR. SIT DOWN. I'M SERIOUS, YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE. THERE ARE NO MISTAKES. APPARENTLY, THERE ARE. MY WIFE PUT ANTIFREEZE AND SLEEPING PILLS IN MY DINNER. I ATE IT AND DIED. I'M NOT THE ONE YOU WANT. WRONG. YOU ARE HERE FOR A REASON. OKAY, OKAY, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, BUT THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I WAS DYING. I NEEDED TO GET THE PHONE. MY ARM JUST KIND OF-- YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR ARM. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING. MY WIFE MURDERED ME... SHE SHOULD BE HERE, NOT ME. WHO DIED FIRST? DO YOU MIND? IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE, THEN, TECHNICALLY, SHE WASN'T A MURDERER WHEN SHE DIED. YOU WERE STILL ALIVE. SO YOU'RE SAYING THE FACT THAT SHE POISONED ME TO DEATH HAS NO RELEVANCE? YEAH, BUT WHO DIED FIRST? I'M THE VICTIM HERE! YOU NEED TO FIX THIS. TAKE YOUR SEAT. YOU'RE NOT READY. OKAY. OKAY. I THINK IT'S TIME I TALK TO SOMEONE WITH A LITTLE MORE AUTHORITY. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO FIND YOUR SUPERIOR? TAKE YOUR SEAT. NOW THEN, PEOPLE. IT'S TIME TO GET INTO YOUR EXPLORATION GROUPS FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. EXCUSE ME, I'M NOT FINISHED. [FIRMLY] TAKE YOUR SEAT. IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO ALLOW MYSELF TO BE RAILROADED, YOU'RE WRONG. [WRATHFULLY] TAKE YOUR SEAT! [VOICE REVERBERATING WITH EXPLOSIVE FORCE] OKAY! OKAY... HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. OKAY? [PANTING] SO JUST, UH... LET ME GET HIM OUT OF YOUR FACE FOR YOU. PLEASE, JUST... GIVE HIM ONE MORE CHANCE. INTO YOUR DISCUSSION GROUPS. NOW! COME ON, ASS-PIPE. YOU'RE WITH US. START WITH YOUR PROCLAMATIONS, THEN EXPLORE THE GENESIS OF THE EVIL YOU HAVE COMMITTED. MY NAME IS WILLIAM, I KILLED BOTH MY PARENTS. I STABBED MY FATHER 28 TIMES, AND I SMASHED MY MOTHER'S SKULL. MY NAME IS JULIEN, AND I-- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT... HOW CAN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SO MATTER-OF-FACT. IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH IT. DON'T SAY THAT. I MEAN, I HATE WHAT I DID. I HATED IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, AND I HATE IT HERE. THEN WHY KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE. IT HELPS US GAIN ACCEPTANCE FOR WHAT WE DID. CAN WE JUST GET ON WITH IT ALREADY? I'M GETTING MENSTRUAL CRAMPS JUST LISTENING TO YOU TWO. MY NAME IS JULIEN. I DROWNED MY DAUGHTER AND MY TWO BOYS. OH, JESUS... WHY? 'CAUSE I WAS PISS FUCKING DRUNK, THAT'S WHY. AND AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE PERFECT WAY TO SPITE MY BITCH WIFE. YOUR TURN. SO EVERY TIME YOU GO THROUGH YOUR DOORS, YOU HAVE TO KILL YOUR KIDS AGAIN? AND YOU KILL YOUR PARENTS? WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO OUR PROCLAMATIONS. THE FACILITATOR WILL BE CROSS IF WE DON'T. [EDGAR]: I CAN'T-- I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO IT. YOU, GO AHEAD. OH, NO, NO, NOT HER. NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR THE SHIT THAT COMES OUT OF HER. WHY? OH, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID, DO YOU? SHOW HIM. [MUTTERING] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. NO, NO. [FIRMLY] SHOW HIM. GO FUCK YOURSELF, BABY KILLER. SHOW HIM! SEE THAT? EGO? OH, YEAH. YEAH, SHE THINKS SHE'S BETTER THAN US. BUT SHE'S NOT. NO, YOU SEE, YOU'RE JUST A SUIE PIECE OF SHIT. WE MAY HAVE KILLED OURS, BUT, UH, SHE TORTURED HERS. RIGHT, WILLIAM? RIGHT, WILLIAM? YUP. YOU'RE RIGHT. [DORIS]: I WARNED YOU, DIDN'T I? [EDGAR]: WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM? [DORIS]: I DIDN'T DO IT TO THEM, I DID IT TO MYSELF. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD JUST GO BLACK AND SILENT AND IT WOULD ALL BE OVER. [CHUCKLES WRYLY] BOY, WAS I WRONG. "SUIE?" SUICIDE? YOU COMMITTED SUICIDE? I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. I WAS RUINING THEIR LIVES. THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET OUT OF BED WAS TO DRINK. I WENT THROUGH A QUART OF GIN EVERY DAY. BUT HE SAID YOU TORTURED THEM. MY DAUGHTERS FIND THEIR DEAD MOTHER HANGING IN A TREE? SOME MIGHT CONSIDER THAT TORTURE. NO. NO, HE'S JUST SAYING THAT TO EASE HIS OWN GUILT. HE'S CONVINCED THE REST OF THEM TO DO THE SAME. TORTURE OR NOT, I KNOW I DID THE RIGHT THING. DON'T SAY THAT. THAT CAN'T BE TRUE. IT IS TRUE. I NEED TO BELIEVE THAT. NO, THIS IS WRONG. NEITHER OF US BELONG HERE, NOT WITH PEOPLE LIKE THEM. OH, YEAH? THEN WHY'D SHE DO IT, EDGAR? HMM? WHY DID SHE POISON YOU? I'M GUESSING IT WASN'T BECAUSE YOU LEFT THE TOILET SEAT UP. [DOORS CREAK OPEN] I CAN'T GO IN THERE. I CAN'T GO IN THERE. I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. [BUTTON CUFF TEARING] OH, YOUR BUTTON... MAY! [SCREAMING] WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? [SCREAMING] [GROANING WITH EFFORT] WHY DID YOU DO THAT? WHY DID YOU DO THAT...

BUT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CAN'T LET THESE FUCKERS SEE YOU CRUMBLE, ALL RIGHT? YOU GOOD? ALL RIGHT, COME ON. LET'S GO. WHAT? NO, GROUP'S THIS WAY. YOU SHOULD BE IN GROUP, EDGAR. WHY DOES MAYLON HAVE TO KEEP RELIVING THAT NIGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN? SHE CAN FEEL IT. I KNOW SHE CAN. I CAN SEE IT IN HER EYES. SHE FEELS HERSELF BEING CHOKED TO DEATH. I DID IT. YOU DID WHAT? MAYLON'S DEATH WAS NO ACCIDENT. I WAS SO MAD. I LOST MY MIND. THE... THE THOUGHT OF IT... THE RAGE I FELT, IT MAKES ME SICK. IT WAS INTENTIONAL, GODDAMNIT, AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT. ARE YOU FINISHED?

[SIGHS] JESUS CHRIST, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN, ISN'T IT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT. SON OF A BITCH WON'T MOVE. LET ME GET ON YOUR SHOULDERS. LET ME GET ON YOUR SHOULDERS. I'LL OPEN IT UP AND I'LL GO THROUGH, THEN I'LL PULL YOU UP. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. [WINCING AND STRAINING] YOU GOT IT? YEAH. WHERE DO YOU THINK IT GOES? I DON'T CARE AS LONG AS IT'S NOT HERE. MAYBE IT TAKES US BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY, AND WE GET TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY. COME ON, HURRY UP! I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN. I'LL KNOW BETTER NOW.

WHERE'S DORIS? WHAT HAPPENED TO DORIS? [FACILITATOR]: INSUBORDINATION IS NOT TOLERATED, A FACT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND. NOW, GET BACK TO GROUP. GET DOWN FROM THERE! I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. I'M NOT GOING TO KILL HER AGAIN. [TELEVISION]: DON'T DO IT, EDGAR. YOU'RE NOT READY. GET HIM! DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY. [SLAMS HEAVILY] [KIDS LAUGH AND PLAY] THERE HE IS. GIVE ME THE BIKE. HUH?

WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR DAD. FOR SOME REASON, HE ISN'T ONE. THAT'S 'CAUSE HE'S NOT HIS DAD. JUST SOME WHITE DUDE WHO FUCKS HIS MOM. [LAUGHING] YEAH... AW, HAVE YOU SEEN HER? PHEW, I BET HE PAYS HER. SHE'S A HOT LITTLE HO. SHUT UP! YOU GOT ANY COIN? WE COULD GO IN ON IT. PULL A FUCKING TRAIN. DON'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY MAMA! SHUT THE FUCK UP, FOBBY! AND GIVE ME MY BIKE! YO! KICK HIS FUCKING HEAD IN!

[MAYLON SNIFFLES] WHAT'S WRONG? I CANNOT TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE HIS BROTHER. WHERE... WHERE IS HE? HE'S CUTTING THE GRASS. GOGAN WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IT, BUT HE HAS NOT COME HOME FROM SCHOOL. EDGAR IS DOING IT TO PUNISH HIM. HE DOES THESE THINGS. IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S BEING NICE, BUT HE'S ANGRY. I USED TO THINK THAT HE WAS A KIND MAN. HE USED TO BE KIND. MAYBE IF GOGAN HAD DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, THEN-- I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT GOGAN! HE'S ALWAYS SO SAD. I WISH I NEVER CAME HERE. Y-YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE, ARE YOU? WHERE CAN I GO? I HAVE NO MONEY. HE CONTROLS EVERYTHING. HE WON'T LET ME GET A JOB. I CAN'T EVEN GET OUT OF HERE WITHOUT HIM BEING MAD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE THINKS THAT EVERY MAN IS TRYING TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM HIM, AND HE'S AFRAID THAT I WILL GO. I'M SORRY. THERE IS NO ONE TO HELP ME-- LOOK, MAYLON, STAY WHERE YOU ARE. I'M GOING TO COME RIGHT OVER. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I KNOW AND YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME. THIS IS CRAZY. EDGAR, HE... [EDGAR'S VOICE WHISPERS] EDGAR LOVES YOU... HE LOVES YOU. AND HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU. YES, BUT I DON'T WANT HIM TO KEEP ME. [LAWNMOWER WHIRRING OUTSIDE] "I DON'T WANT HIM TO KEEP ME?" [LAWNMOWER SPUTTERS AND DIES] [BEEPS OFF PHONE] [EDGAR'S VOICE ECHOES] IF YOU NEED MONEY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ME... I'M SORRY... I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE KEEPING SECRETS... ...SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNTS... ...KEEPING SECRETS... ...DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE KEEPING SECRETS... ...IF YOU NEEDED MONEY, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ASK ME... WHY WOULD YOU NEED YOUR OWN SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNT? WHERE'S YOUR NEW BIKE? MOST KIDS WOULD KILL TO HAVE A BIKE LIKE THAT... GOGAN! WAIT! GOGAN! STOP! GOGAN! [SOBBING] [EDGAR'S VOICE ECHOES] GOGAN... THIS IS YOUR MOTHER'S HOME. SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE... [VOICE OVERLAPPING AND SWIRLING] HE'LL BE ON A PLANE THIS WEEKEND... [LAWNMOWER PULL-CHAIN RINGS MENACINGLY] DID YOU FIND HIM? [EDGAR'S VOICE ECHOES]: WHY DID HE RUN AWAY? WHY DID HE RUN AWAY? I DON'T KNOW. WE WERE TALKING. HE GOT AGGRESSIVE, AND GUESS WHAT? HE JUST TOOK OFF. SO, OBVIOUSLY, YOU COULDN'T CATCH UP TO HIM. NO. I COULD NOT FIND HIM. MY NAME IS EDGAR, AND... AND I KILLED MY WIFE. HI, EDGAR. IT'S MY FAULT THAT OUR LIVES ARE OVER, AND IT'S MY FAULT THAT HER SON'S NOW AN ORPHAN. I KNOW THIS NOW, AND I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT YOU DID? WELL, I WANT THEM TO KNOW... I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL THEM HOW SORRY I AM, WILL I? HMM... APPARENTLY, YOU WERE READY. HURRY UP THEN, TAKE YOUR SEAT. DORIS... DORIS... EDGAR, GET BACK HERE! ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU? LOOK, I KNOW NOW THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. EDGAR! VERY WELL THEN. WHO'D LIKE TO GO NEXT? OKAY, GO AHEAD. YOU FEEL IT NOW, RIGHT? MY NAME IS ISABEL... FEEL WHAT? RELIEF... RELIEF THAT COMES FROM ACCEPTING YOUR GUILT. YOU CAN NOW EMBRACE YOUR PUNISHMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE IT, RIGHT? THIS IS THE BETTER PLACE? DON'T WORRY. SOON, YOU'LL FEEL THE COMFORT THAT COMES FROM YOUR PAIN. TRUST ME. DORIS-- LEAVE ME ALONE. I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU, YOU WERE RIGHT. I WAS SO INTENT ON ESCAPING-- THERE IS NO ESCAPING WHAT WE'VE DONE. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT NOW. YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND LIVE WITH IT. WE ALL DO. [SIGHS WEARILY] YOU KNOW THAT, TOO, RIGHT? LOOK, WE MAY HAVE TO ACCEPT IT, BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. [LAUGHS] FEELING BAD ABOUT WHAT I DID ISN'T ENOUGH. NOT FOR ME-- YEAH, WHAT ELSE IS THERE? I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER! SOMEHOW. AND I NEED YOUR HELP. [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY] LEAVE ME ALONE. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU. DORIS, LISTEN TO ME. NO! NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME! THEY MADE ME WATCH MY FUNERAL. THAT'S WHERE I WENT. I HEARD REBECCA TELL THE PASTOR THAT IT WAS HER FAULT THAT I KILLED MYSELF. I CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT ANYMORE. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. BUT IF YOU COME WITH ME, YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO. PART OF YOU MADE IT THROUGH MY DOOR. I BROUGHT THIS WITH ME INTO MY BEDROOM. NO. IT.. NO... WE GOTTA TRY. [DOORS SQUEAK OPEN] [WHISPERING NERVOUSLY] WHY? WHAT WOULD I DO IN THERE? I DON'T KNOW.

I'M SORRY I CAN'T STAY. RUNNING DOESN'T WORK. RUNNING DOESN'T WORK! I'M SORRY. DORIS... WHO IS DORIS? OKAY... MAYLON... YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO STOP ME OR I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AGAIN, KILL ME? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, KILL ME? [GHOSTLY PHASE] EDGAR, ARE YOU CALLING ME? OKAY, YOU LAY DOWN. I'LL CALL AN AMBULANCE. IT'S NO USE. I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. OH GOD, I CAN FEEL IT. I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. I'LL TRY TO HELP YOU. BUT AS SOON AS ANYTHING GOES WRONG, I'M LEAVING, AND I'M NOT COMING BACK, OKAY? YOU CAME BACK. ON YOUR OWN. EDGAR, WHO IS THIS? WHAT IS HAPPENING? YOUR HUSBAND'S GOING TO KILL YOU. WE HAVE TO TRY AND STOP HIM. IT DIDN'T REWIND WHEN YOU SAID IT. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. DID SHE SAY YOU WERE GOING TO KILL ME? MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE THINGS. MAYBE YOU CAN STOP ME. [DOOR SLAMS] OH... WHERE IS SHE? I DON'T KNOW. OKAY, WAIT, THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT? I MEAN, IF SHE'S NOT HERE, THEN YOU CAN'T... EDGAR? I NEED TO TELL THEM ABOUT MY DRUG ALLERGIES. JUST GIVE ME THE PHONE. I CAN TELL THEM EVERYTHING YOU WANT. PLEASE JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

[MAYLON SOBBING] YOU TELL MAY IT'S GOING TO BE OVER SOON AND NOT TO WORRY. NOT TO WORRY, IT'S GOING TO BE OVER SOON, AND... [WHISPERING] TELL HER I WAS INSECURE. TELL HER I COULDN'T... I WAS SO AFRAID OF LOSING HER, THAT I... AND TELL HER THAT SHE NEEDED HER OWN MONEY, AND GOGAN, TELL HER THAT... TELL HER THAT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS GETTING PICKED ON DON'T TALK ANYMORE. IT'S DAYTIME. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? DORIS, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. OH, MY GOD. IT'S NOT YOUR YARD. WHAT? IT'S MINE. DORIS, WAIT! [MAYLON SOBBING IN ANGUISH] I LOST MY MIND! I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DIE! I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! [SOBBING] PLEASE, EDGAR... WE CAN'T DO THIS. [WEEPING] EDGAR... I CAN'T DIE. DORIS? WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. IF I DIE FIRST, IT MEANS MAYLON MURDERED ME. WHAT IF SHE TAKES MY PLACE? WHAT IF SHE HAS TO RELIVE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN? I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. LOOK HOW MUCH FUN THEY'RE HAVING. AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL? DORIS, YOU NEED TO HELP ME. NO, I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE MY LITTLE GIRLS. I CAN'T. THEN I HAVE NO CHOICE. I-I HAVE TO KILL HER. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. I HAVE TO KILL HER AGAIN. [CRYING SOFTLY] [KNOCK ON DOOR] EDGAR? ARE YOU OKAY?

I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE IT UNDER THE TREE FOR HIM, IF IT'S OKAY. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WHY DON'T WE PLANT IT? WHY HERE? OH, IT WAS HIS REASON AND HIS ALONE. YOU'LL ONLY MAKE YOURSELF CRAZY WONDERING WHY, DEAR. IT'S THE NOTE HE LEFT. "DO NOT BE AFRAID. "I HAD TO DO THIS. "IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU AND GOGAN CAN BE FREE. "NO MATTER WHAT, "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, EVEN IF IT IS..." THAT IS WHERE IT ENDS. "TOO MUCH..." "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU EVEN IF IT IS TOO MUCH."
