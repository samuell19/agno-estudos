#WHERE IS THE UNICORN# How the hell did he get away? Didn't anybody think to take his passport or would that be too offense for his all mighty friends? I'm telling you Fred, this is a waste of time. You won't get in to see the judge. I don't want to see him. I want him to see me. Are you alright, did you hurt your foot or something? Don't worry about me Rich. You just take care of your job. I'm sorry sir you can't go into the meeting. - Why not? It's only for people directly involved in the case. My daughter is the victim here Ma'am, I think that makes me directly involved in the case, wouldn't you? Mr. DiBenedetto, would you come in please. Judge, I want to talk to you. - I know who you are Mr. Maddux. I am sorry. I hope you're happy with your decision judge. I hope you sleep nights. I based my decision on the testimony of some very prominent people. Now I've got a father out there who wants my head. And I don't blame him. Do we have any idea where he is? Judge, we know Einhorn landed in London and then we lost him. We're following every lead we can, but, well, it's not easy trying to find a planetary enzyme, your honor. A what? - Planetary enzyme, sir. It's how the defendant would occasionally refer to himself. Believe me it's not my choice of words. Mine either. Mr. Gelman, warn those prominent character witnesses that if they assist Einhorn in any way, they are going to face some very serious charges, understood? We know he left from Canada, probably with a suitcase filled with Bronfman money. Any luck with Mrs. Bronfman? Soon-to-be ex Mrs. Bronfman. They're getting a divorce. Nobody knows where the hell she is. Let the old man know that if the wife's in jail for aiding and abetting. He'll get a break on the alimony. Maybe he'll turn her in. He's traveled all through Europe over the years. But he's only fluent in English. Einhorn likes to talk too much, not to be some place where he can. You don't need a passport to get from England to Ireland. Ireland doesn't have an extradition treaty with us. It's all done case by case. A buck says he's in Ireland. Yes. - May I help you? - Yes, we've come about the room. Please come in. Thank you. Will you please stop doing that? Why did you have to give them your real name? Because I don't want to be anybody else. So, how are you doing? I'm good. Real good. When are they letting you out? - Soon. Damn leg kept giving me a problem. But you're okay? - Oh yeah, I'm just fine Rich. Now you don't worry about me. You've got enough to worry about. Ira, I was wondering if I could ask a wee favor? Certainly. We're taking a trip over to the states next week. I have a conference in Chicago and we'd like you to take care of the dog for us. No, no problem. How long you gonna be gone? - A couple of weeks. May take a little side trip over to Philadelphia while we're there. Listen, we better talk. So because of my anti-nuclear duties. They trumped up some charges. Nothing serious, trespassing, destruction of public property. That sort of thing. I'd rather not be harassed, if you know what I mean. So I'd like it if you didn't mention it to anyone that I'm staying here. The FBI appreciates your cooperation Mr. Weaire. Yes, that's him. Oh, sweet Jesus Dennis, we left the dog with him. Notify the State Department. It's in their hands now. Don't worry they'll take care of it. You've been gone all day. I missed you. I'm getting my things now Ira. I'm leaving. Oh really. Get out of my way. No. We can just talk. No we don't. Get out of my way. Hey, welcome home, Roey is a wonderful companion. We're just dropping off our bags. Collette's not well. We're gonna pop over. He's a murderer. - I know Mr. Weaire. I've been in contact with the FBI. But I got no standard to arrest him. I can't even hold him. Not until I get words from above. Which should be any day now. What are we supposed to do? If I were you, I'd get him out of my house. Get out of my house. Bye daddy. You have a good afternoon. - Yes, thank you, honey. Meg are you there? Come here a second please. Well, they're gonna put me in the hospital again next week. Mom told me. And don't know why they want to cut me open again Just a waste of time, not gonna do any good. Well the doctors say it might. Doctors... I'm sick of what the doctor's are saying. I'm sick of just sitting here. It's about all I can do anymore. I want you to do something for me. Of course. When I burried your sister, I said I would not put a tombstone on her grave until this nightmare's over. I remember. - That's good because it may take longer than all of us expected and I may not be here. Don't let them forget her. Don't let them give up on her. Don't let them put her file on some shelf and not do anything. Don't you worry about that. Promise? I promise. Hey, why don't you let me stay here with you this afternoon? Get out of here. I can't watch a football game with women, you know that. Get out of here. - I love you daddy. I love you too. Even if we don't find him, we may not have a case. It's just been too long. Witnesses start dying. Evidence is gonna weaken. That's why I wanted to talk to you Meg. We've got to do something now, before it all goes down the toilet. Like what? A trial in absentia. Well, what's the point, trying him when he's not here? When he's found guilty and I'm pretty sure he will be. It means that when we get him back here. He goes right to jail. No bail, no nothing, and he can't run again. Is this whole thing a waste of time. Because our parents told us to respect the government. But the government's doing nothing but screw us all over and cause us all a lot of pain. All I can tell you is I've pursued every avenue I can. Is this the best option? Maybe not, but it's all I've got right now. And I can't go ahead without you and your family on board. Yeah, all that's left of my family. You know mom died about a year after dad. I used to think this thing was some sort of a nightmare. But it's worse. Nightmare, you eventually wake up from. It just keeps going on. My parents didn't even live to see it end. But I sure intend to. If you ever get homesick just look out the window. Right down there is your American embassy. Anika, come here and look at this. A little touch of home. My first motion is to bar this trial in absentia because of the serious problems involved in trying a person who's never been notified of the trial date. If Mr. Gelman knows the whereabouts of is client, I can sure you we will notify Mr. Einhorn of this trial. Are you Mr. Madlin, the tutor? - Yes. I was wondering would you work with my daughter? Why certainly. Ladies and gentleman, on a rainy Spring night, Holly Maddux told Ira Einhorn that she was leaving. The years of mental and physical abuse had taken their toll and Holly was trying to embark on a new life. But no woman ever walked out on Ira Einhorn. But Holly Maddux tried and that's what killed her. Ira Einhorn didn't just hit her. He pummeled Holly Maddux with a blunt heavy object. At least a dozen times. Leaving holes in Holly's skull, the size of silver dollars. But Holly didn't die right away. She was probably still alive when Ira Einhorn sealed her in his trunk. Why did he keep the body? That's the compelling question here. But the answer is simple, Ira Einhorn believes that he is smarter than all of us. By keeping her body, Ira Einhorn was laughing at us. He still is. To kill what you love, when you can't have it is a very natural thing. Ira Einhorn whispered those words to Rita Siegel after he attacked her. He believes it, but he was wrong. Because the only person that Ira Einhorn ever loved was Ira Einhorn. We find the defendant, Ira Einhorn, guilty of murder in the first degree. Thank you. I'm sorry, but I won't be happy until I see that bastard in cuffs and on his way to jail. Than I'll smile and I'll laugh right in his face. Dennis, it's Ira. How dare you come back to Ireland. Are you insane? Leave me alone. - I'm calling the police. He left this afternoon. #SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE# Thanks. And that's everything. I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to risk losing you. I love you so much, Anika. You're part of my soue. Look at me. Do you honestly believe that I could ever hurt another human being? No, you could never do that. Will you marry me? Yes. Really? - Yes. We need people to see this all over the world. Are you sure they're going to see it overseas? All over Europe and most of Asia. Okay now I don't want to just focus on Ira. I think your family story is very important. There's some fascinating stuff here. Your father's affiliation with the American Nazi Party. What? What did you just say? Get the hell out of here. People have been lying about daddy since this whole thing started. Calm down. Would you excuse us for one minute. It's got to help. - It'll get the story out there. It'll get his picture smeared over the world. It might just stir things up. - I'm just so sick of people lying about daddy. Well, we all are. But this is a chance for us to try and get the truth out there. So what do we say? We need the publicity Buffy, it's all we got left. What do you say, we all have to agree on this? Fine. - Okay. Not one person in this town on my intellectual plane. He said you got into an argument over a Bridge game. You know how frustrating that is. He said you broke a table and threatened to hit him. Is that what he said? No. The French are famous for their ability to exaggerate. Look, we had a terse discussion, but I certainly didn't resort to any violence. I'm afraid our friends are particularly like Americans. You don't believe him do you? Do you? - No, course not. I can't take it here much more. It's just us up here all the time. The library's a joke. Now I can't even go into town with somebody spreading lies about me. I just can't take it. It's killing me. I gotta get out. We know Ira married Anika Flodin in 1995. Then he mentioned of Anika Flodin and Interlope was immediately notified. She went to renew her driver's license. And there she was, living with her American husband in the south of France. We can't afford to send you - I've worked a long time on this case. My daughter was in diapers when I started. We can't afford trips to France. Let the French handle it. I am not Ira Einhorn. Hello Ira. It's been a long time. Well, it's been a long long time, but hopefully that's all over now. Did you ever think they'd find him? - Yes. Yes I did. I don't think God would be that cruel to us or Holly. I just wish my parents could have been around to see this. When you told me that they found him, you should have seen my bosses face cause I dropped everything and ran right out of there. What time is it supposed to be on John? - Should be any minute. That's it. Meg, get in here, it's on! Excuse me! It's on. What's up? Spit it out. I just keep hoping that someday, I can finally think about Holly and not get so angry. I mean even when I think about the good times I just get so damn mad. And now that they got him, I want to start having happy memories again I guess. You know what? - What? I think it's time to buy her headstone. Yeah. We are going to fight every attempt to extradite Ira Einhorn because of due process violations during the trial and sentencing in absentia. The man did not get a chance to defend himself. European courts do not like trials by absentia. Even Nazi war criminals were not subjected to this treatment. Adolph Eichmann was brought back for his trial. You know honey it's times like these that I understand why everyone hates lawyers. My son is innocent. Maybe finally we can get to the bottom of this and find out who really killed poor Holly. A fugitive forfeits his right to appeal. Once you're tried in absentia that's it. I know the statute Rich. - That's what his lawyer's gonna try to nail us on. Do the French have trials in absentia? - Yes, but over there it's different. I looked it up last night. If the person is caught, he gets the right to another trial. They're going to argue that according to Pennsylvania law, he doesn't get another trial. - We will also bring to the court's attention, the fact that you are sentenced to life in prison without parole. Our government does not recognize a sentence that does not allow for This is fine. But have you read the paper's I've sent you. Because it clearly shows a sign of conspiracy against me, see. I set up a network and we became in possession of documents and these documents clearly showed Ira. No one wants to hear this story again. This story, as you call it, happens to be vital to my defense. No, it is not. This is just a fairytale that no one believes but you and you will not tell it to the courtroom. So what happens now? If it makes you feel any better, the French have him on probation for entering the country under false pretenses. He has to check in with the local police twice a week and he can't leave the province. He's been shunned in the village. They don't like having a murdered in the neighborhood and they take every chance to let him know. You know what the best part of it is? He knows we're never gonna give up. Deep down, he knows we're gonna get him. Be honest Rich. How does it look? I don't know Meg. At this point, I'm just a consultant for the State Department. You be sure and let me know if you hear anything. Especially if it's bad news cause I want to tell them in person. Well let's hope that doesn't happen. - Yes, let's hope. The fact that Mr. Einhorn will never be given another trial is against the very fiber of French law. A life sentence without chance for parole is both inhumane and degrading. But what can we expect from a country that has become so barbaric that death sentences are handed to children and the mentally handicapped. It's not gonna ring any faster with you staring at it Buffy. Yeah, I know. But I can't help it. What time is it over there now. Breakfast. They will send him back, won't they Meg? And due to the fact that there is no legal recourse awaiting you in America, we cannot, according to French law, extradite you. You have made a just decision. I am a peaceful man. My whole life has been dedicated to making sure this planet remained a peaceful place. Holly. Oh, there you are. Come on Holly. What you got there, a flower for mommy? Come here. Hello. Did you pick me some flowers did you? She likes flowers like her auntie does. Don't you worry Holly, we're not giving up. We'll never give up. There you go Meg. Let's go. Happy Birthday Holly. Who wants to go to Aunt Mary's house and have some cake? I do. #ON FEBRUARY 18, 1999 THE FRENCH COURTS RULED THAT IRA EINHORN# #BE RETURNED TO PHILADELPHIA TO BE RETRIED.# #PENDING HIS APPEAL, HE REMAINS IN FRANCE A FREE MAN.#
