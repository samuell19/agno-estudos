Good morning, Rosa on the air with the latest sports news. Today the whole world froze. More than one billion people stayed at home today... watch the finals of the World Cup in Japan on TV. But in Asia there will be another ending... which will be followed by only a few thousand people. This game will take place between two countries with the lowest football rating in the world. The idea for this match came to mind of two Dutch guys... when their own national team failed to qualify for the World Cup. Yes that's right. At first we were overwhelmed by the fact that... the Dutch team failed to qualify for the World Cup. But there was another consequence... we became interested in the question of who loses more often than Holland. We looked at the FIFA World Rankings on the Internet... which lists all the countries that play football. There are more than 200 such countries. And many countries... very often lose. There are many countries that you have never heard of. At the bottom of this ranking are Bhutan and Montserrat. So the idea was actually born. Perhaps we acted very naively - we just sent two faxes. One to Montserrat and one to Bhutan. And they began to wait for an answer. Paul Morris is the national team coach. He invited me to the office, showed me the fax and asked what I thought. And I said to myself: This will be a good experience. This will be very helpful for the development of football in Montserrat. We felt like a good opportunity presented itself somehow... take part in the great sports festival. Our teams and our countries are given the chance... share our love for the game. The idea to write an article came to me as soon as I heard about the game. As soon as we heard about Montserrat, our first question was: "Where is this Montserrat?" Montserrat? This is Montserrat. When I was working for the police in London... I coached our football team. Successfully. Therefore, when I arrived here, I already had experience as a coach. It's very, very difficult here. The population is relatively small. And here nothing is produced for football, so you have to import everything. For example, corner flags. I just brought two whistles from England the last time I went there. There are only five clubs in the Montserrat championship. This is problem... because you know the strengths and weaknesses of each team. IDial Printers, School... Trendsetters, Tremurz... and, of course, the Police that I play for. We have 24 changing rooms, one per player at their home. Or in the car. Joke. We have no changing rooms or a shower. Today it was raining and volcanic ash rose into the air... and many players have sore eyes. Sometimes we pause for the players to wash their eyes... because if you have ash in your eyes it is very annoying. The disaster happened on the peaceful island of Montserrat: a volcano erupted. Half of the population will have to be evacuated. This is a volcanic eruption... I ruined all my plans. I lost two plots of land that I just bought. On one site, I started building a new house. Of course, construction had to be stopped. Here in the valley... where dog bites are worse than barking... Left unattended, the sheep died, giving the flies a fat Christmas. Here, in the valley, where the earth reels like a drunken... where sulfur eats away at your teeth... and women brush their smiles at her. Here in the valley where the ashes have whitened the vegetation... and the bright lights of death dance on the mountain tops... I see a new cloud breaking out in the mountains... and hope for a happy New Year... here in the valley. Montserrat still suffers... from a devastating volcanic eruption. Montserrat lost... all of our sources of income and we are totally dependent on UK assistance. In 1997, only a few people had heard of Montserrat... with the exception of holidaymakers in this region. But in 1997, after the volcanic eruption, many people became aware of Montserrat, especially in England. Hot hot hot is a song that has been a calling card... not only my native Montserrat, but also Caribbean music in general. This song was a gift from God. She was born almost by accident. Some listeners who listen to us... in Antigua, Saint Kitts and Nevis and here in Montserrat... perhaps asking themselves in surprise: Bhutan? Is this a country at all? Where is it? Here is Bhutan. Bhutan is a small kingdom in the Himalayas. This is a monarchy. The peculiarity of Bhutan is... that it has been sovereign and independent throughout its history. This is a photograph of our king. His Majesty, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Here at our headquarters... a very important and valuable photo is hanging. At that time, in the 70s, His Majesty was a very good goalkeeper. It takes huge stadiums to be a football country... and in a mountainous country like ours it is very expensive to build them. Now all Bhutanese live in the atmosphere of the World Cup... very many Bhutanese are interested in the World Cup, they watch all the matches. So the idea to take part in it, even indirectly, was very interesting. Before the World Cup, we sold 30 or 40 TVs. Sale for the World Cup. Hurry up! The quantity is limited. Bhutanese are very fond of football. This is how cable TV entered the country. The 1998 FIFA World Cup was held and many people would like to watch the matches. In a world where only the big is important and the small is insignificant... and, as a rule, does not play any role in our daily life... Montserrat for most Bhutanese... this is a country they have never heard of. This is the importance of sport... thanks to the match against Montserrat, every Bhutanese will now know... where is Montserrat. And the Bhutanese, I am convinced, will feel love and respect... to this country. Whether we win or lose. After all, this match is held not only to find a winner. National sport of Montserrat: Cricket I have very beautiful memories of what was here before. President of the Football Federation of Montserrat And now the stadium is in the "restricted area". Here is the dressing room. For several years it was covered with a thick layer of ash. Layer 1.5 or 2 meters thick. We are currently building a new stadium in Blakes. We build it in four stages. First stage... will be finished in a few days. After that, the opening. Tomorrow is going to be a big day. The new football stadium will open tomorrow. The whole island is looking forward to it. Big names like Jack Warner, vice president of FIFA will come here. Caribbean football is like our dances, our songs... our carnival, our calypso music. This is a distinctive feature of our region. I am also familiar with Asian football, it is completely different. I think Asian football is a little tough, a little dry... and even a little militaristic. It lacks the artistry and prowess of football in the Caribbean and Brazil. Montserrat ranks last and Bhutan comes last. But Montserrat will defeat Bhutan in June... Bhutan will see that the last location of Montserrat was only a temporary phenomenon. The world will see how our viable people... rises from the ashes. We're going to... What is the name of this mountainous country, remind me again? To Bhutan. Guys, are we going to win? Where are the players? Are we going to win? Montserrat will win. 4 weeks left Bhutan chose... your own development philosophy. We focus on the Gross National Happiness indicator. Not on GDP, but on VNS. This is based on the understanding... that everyone is looking for happiness in life. This is the ultimate goal. And if happiness is the ultimate goal of all Bhutanese and indeed all people... it also becomes a challenge for the government. There are two aspects of sports. First, it provides an opportunity for social and cultural interaction... between people, countries and nations. I think this is the most important contribution... which sport can bring to our society. Thanks to this, peace, harmony and mutual understanding between peoples are spread. This is especially important in a world undergoing rapid globalization. In a world where people come together, like in a small village. Another aspect of sports is competition. This is a world of victories and defeats. Unfortunately, in modern sports, wins and losses have become more important... than rapprochement between nations. For me sports... as a means of promoting friendship and mutual understanding between peoples is much more important... than rivalry and wrestling, which are also part of the sport. National Sport of Bhutan: Archery Archery is not just a sport. It is also a great holiday. Primarily in the countryside, but now also in the city. Archery is popular. And it will remain popular even as football spreads. I am Wengei Dorji. I am a striker in the national team. And the captain for the past two years. And I have been playing in the national team for three years. Before that I played in a professional club in India. I used to play football in school, but we only played for fun. We had no idea about real football. Nobody ever trained us. We just kicked the ball across the field. I started playing football very early. But as an amateur, no training... without proper diet and supervision. Then, in 1996... yes, in 1996 when I was studying in India... I was able to get into the football academy. In the 60s... when we started to develop our country... we sent many children to study in neighboring countries, for example in India... and these children played football there. And when they returned home from school, they brought real football with them. 3 weeks left News from the airport. Matthijs de Jong arrives today... organizer of the football game against Montserrat. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the game that the whole city is talking about. Our stadium is very different from those in Japan. Stadiums in Japan accommodate 72,000 people... equipped with revolutionary sliding roofs. The Japanese also have underground field heating systems to keep the grass in top condition. Besides, all expensive places have special glass holders. There are 528 speakers. That's 527 more than we have, and they all work. True, our stadiums have something in common: they also have two football goals, just like ours. Welcome. Come on in. This is my mother. My wife, my son... my daughter and my brother. This is my bedroom. I... I dream of playing football. And score goals against Montserrat. Match against Kuwait... was our first international match. This was a big setback. Bhutan's biggest defeat was 0:20. But there were also positive moments in our defeat. Although they scored 20 goals... but on the other hand, the existence of Bhutan became known throughout the world. We had hard defeats and hard victories... and neither of the two teams benefited. Montserrat's biggest defeat was 0:11. 2 weeks left It was a weather forecast. And now the football news. Today our guys are playing against a special opponent. The English Navy is coming to us today to play a practice match with us in Little Bay... So if you are somewhere nearby, support our guys. And we will be very glad to see our English friends who will arrive soon. The match will start at 5 pm when our boys are out of work. We hope they score some goals to feel confident in their abilities. We are fully prepared. If we fail to meet our expectations, it is certainly not because of insufficient preparation. All players are ready to play. We also prepared ourselves culturally and are now looking forward to the trip... and we hope to play well regardless of the outcome. I want to give the people of Bhutan God's blessing... and we look forward to a warm welcome when our players arrive there. And now especially for our boys who are on their way to Bhutan... Hot hot hot song Let's all pray. Lord, thank you for coming here. It was a long and arduous journey. We haven't made it to Bhutan yet. We are now in Amsterdam. Give us peace and peace of mind. Lord have mercy. Amen. Why don't we sing something just to relax? Cecil Lake, goalkeeper A bit tricky, right? Montserrat is now in the spotlight. If we win, I hope the government will award us medals. I learned a lot from the World Cup. If you do tactical analysis of games... you can learn a lot. How to play... how to move. With what attitude should you go to the game. Tactics. There is still a lot to learn... from the South Korean national team. She is in the semifinals now. So you see - Asian teams can play great too. I am now sitting next to the office of a local Bhutanese newspaper. I have just learned some strange news. It's incredible. But both teams, Bhutan and Montserrat, were left without coaches. The Bhutanese coach died suddenly. But also Paul Morris, coach of Montserrat... also resigned almost on the same day. They are two hours late. They are now at the Kolkata airport. Now the weather is still bad... and in Calcutta they decided that the planes should not take off yet... so the Montserrat players will remain in Kolkata for now. We have been waiting for two hours and we decided that now we will return to the hotel. We'll try again tomorrow. Let's go to? 7 days left Today is a great day. The plane has just landed. There he is. Players are still on board... so I'll go greet them. Welcome to Bhutan. All is well? It's been a long journey. Yes, we flew from afar. That was not easy. But we are used to difficulties. Sunday won't be easy either. A good friend of mine from the Football Federation of Bhutan... already looks a little scared. All is well, no need to worry. We'll be a little late. Hello, can I speak with Paul Morris? This is Matthijs de Jong. Paul, this is Matthijs. I just got back from the airport, but you weren't there. What happened? We had an agreement with people from the football association that I would call the most talented, selfless and skilled people to the national team. But the players I gathered, I had to replace... those that other people want to see in the lineup... To tell the truth, I cannot work like that. He made it clear that he wants to have the final say in teaming. The players had a close bond with Paul. He has been with the team for a very long time... so it's very unfortunate that he's not here. 6 days left I'm a little depressed. Our team got sick with something. Seven out of sixteen players are sick. The players arrived a day later. They had to spend the night in Calcutta. They did not like the local conditions. They think that this is where some of them got infected. It is possible that they caught the virus... and I pray that the remaining players don't feel bad either. I will not divulge all the secrets, but we will play at 3-5-2. We will use high awnings, because Bhutanese have short players. So we'll first see if they are good at the top. I think at first most Bhutanese are a little shocked... when they meet the tall Montserrat team on the street. If I am away from home, I miss my wife and child very much. But when I'm bored, I take out pictures. When I miss, I look at their pictures. Look, this is my wife. Here she is. And this is my child, he is 14 months old. A footballer in the future? - Yes of course. I will train him... to become a football player. I do a lot for my team, because I am the captain. I care about the guys. But you need to train yourself and be ready for the upcoming game. 5 days left Today we train until half past two. Good? Initially, we had two judges, but today we may not have one. The coach is also sick. I spoke to him this morning and he is already feeling pretty good... but a little more time is needed. I constantly monitor my players... because it is very important that they can come to the game. So let's see. We have now... two three... four... player on the field, from among those who fell ill. Out of six. Not bad. I ate more pills last night than in the last two years combined. We have high hopes. It will be a good match. We certainly hope to win. 4 days left This is called a hurricane. The wind is so strong that... But it's usually very hot here. No, I've never signed autographs before. We decided that the first meeting should not be too formal... let the music bring us closer together. There is a good atmosphere here. I feel like we are all friends here. Now let me introduce Captain Montserrat: Mr. Thompson. You can just call him "Charlie". 3 days left Yesterday we had a pleasant evening with the Bhutanese team. This was our first meeting. It was very comfortable. The music was great, although the language barrier was too big. I think we will bring some Bhutanese songs home with us. The song Hot hot hot went well. Let's welcome the Montserrat team... from a Caribbean country where we are fighting a volcanic eruption. Thank you very much. We continue the rehearsal. Is everyone ready? Raise your hands. First the football anthem of Montserrat. BUTAN training camp My name is Ari Chance and I am a professional trainer from the Netherlands. I have been coaching the Bhutan national team for several days now. We are preparing for the match against Montserrat. The football federation called on Monday and asked if I could come to Bhutan. At that time, my family and I were going on vacation to Switzerland... but a week later we ended up in Bhutan. No news. There is no judge yet. What will we do? Of course, there can be no two winners after the game. But I am confident that in terms of the growth and development of football, both countries will benefit. Not only in Europe or the USA... but also in third world countries. Good luck. - To you too. Even if we are not participating in the real World Cup final... but still we participate in the event... which has a certain significance. Not only the World Cup... brings people a lot of joy, but sports in general, at any level. Even at the level of the two weakest member countries of FIFA. As soon as they wrote about the match in the newspaper, a flurry of calls began. The BBC called... and international news agencies, newspapers called. Days and weeks later... I realized that this match was really an event. More important than we thought. ANOTHER FINAL My guys are ready and we are going to win. PRESS CONFERENCE (largest ever in Bhutan) There were difficulties with financing. First, we turned to big sports firms... to sponsor us. But they, of course, preferred to sponsor the World Cup participants. In this respect, the World Cup final is more of a final between Nike and Adidas... than the final between Brazil and Germany. Nike and Adidas? It's unpleasant to hear... that they don't want to sponsor us. It's a shame. A big disappointment. There are many teams better than ours. They want to sponsor them. But not the weak Bhutan national team. Our level is very low. But if they want to raise the level of football... then they just have to help poor countries and weak teams. Not just big, wealthy clubs that can do whatever they want. We don't even charge entrance fees. It will be fun, there will be a day of friendship... fun and friendship... and no commerce. I think it's a great pleasure to play and feel... that you have something in common with another country and people. And the more often you can do it... the more fun for both players and spectators. In Bhutan, everyone is talking about the upcoming match. According to our survey, 62 percent of participants consider... that Montserrat will win. What do you think will be the result? Butane. We will win 10-0. Draw. Butane. - We will win. Of course Montserrat will win. Is there a different result possible? It will be a good match. Ole-ole-ole-ole, Bhutan forward! Bhutan cannot lose. I'm betting on Bhutan. The good news: We have two judges. I will be judging the Sunday match. And you will be the fourth referee, or the reserve referee, or the FIFA observer. He doesn't know exactly who he will be yet, but I will definitely be the judge on Sunday. 1 day left Almighty, eternal God... We appeal to you... to thank you for your strength, your honor and your greatness. And we ask you, God... bless our players. Give them a good game. And we will give you all the honors and all the glory... when we conquer by your will and in your name. Amen. We pray that there will be a good game. We cannot go to a monastery or temple and pray... for God to help us. We go to the monastery to pray... to keep the game safe. For both teams. So that no one gets hurt. Now it's a matter of prestige. The whole world knows about tomorrow's game. One final in Japan, another final in Bhutan. Everyone knows this. The match will be broadcast on different channels. And many people from our country will come to see the game... want to attend the match. So we don't want... disappoint them. 12 hours left I will dream of many heads tonight. And many dragons. I would like to play at Arsenal. I would like to, but this is not possible. But I dream about it. It still seems like a dream. The dream that we had in January is now turning into reality. Thanks. I know that you support us. We will do our best. It was the sports correspondent for Radio Montserrat. The monks gave each player a small amulet. It will help us. O Montserrat, my dear Motherland! Your children are holding your flag high. In labors and tears, they serve you. A royal diamond in the hands of God. O Montserrat, blessed by nature, your children sing in your honor. Montserrat is in possession of the ball. Long-range strike by Captain Charles Thompson. Oh, be careful, this is dangerous. Morris kick, and excellent save of Jigme Singai, goalkeeper of the Bhutan national team. Here we go again. A new chance for Montserrat. Pops Morris hits. Moment! And again our goalkeeper saves! He's strong. He is impenetrable! Difficult for Bhutan. Corner assigned. Striker Wengei Dorji heads up... and the score becomes 1-0. Incredible. The ball is in the net! Goalkeeper Montserrat completely lost the ball. Good start for Bhutan. The goal was scored by Wengei Dorji. What an exciting start to the match. Will Bhutan win its first international win? This is a big question. It is very difficult for our Caribbean guests to catch the ball. I think they lack tactical advice from their coach Paul Maurice... who resigned just before traveling to Bhutan. Montserrat has eleven players on the pitch, but as if they are not on the same team. They play chaotically and the new coach does not manage the players. Captain Thompson looks very tired already. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the stadium lies high above sea level. Thompson shoots the ball far away, but it ends up in Bhutan. Good pass to the edge. There Wengei Dorji. Good point. Dorji again. He hits... Is it a goal? No, not yet. Oh my goodness. Goalkeeper Lake seems to know what he's doing. He passes the ball with confidence... to the opponent. Look! Dorjee beats... but the defenders help out. The score almost went 2-0. It's halftime now. The game is very interesting. The teams are roughly equal. Both teams play football well. Cheating the ball. Wangchuck has the ball. Montserrat looks more aggressive. Thompson makes a long pass to the right. Hit! It was dangerous. Very dangerous. Bhutan on the right. Sengei Dukpa hits. Rather, he tried to break through. Luckily we earned a corner. Served by Kinley Dorji. The ball goes into the box... There the defenders of Montserrat are huge as crap, they knock the ball out. But only outside the penalty area. Wangchuck is in possession of the ball. Demonstrates dribbling. Violation. It was very tough. The entire stadium froze. Wengei Dorji at the ball. On the edge of the box. He hits... and the ball is in the net! It's 2-0. Wengei Dorji distinguished himself again. By sending the ball along a path curved like a banana. Fiction! The audience is happy! The Montserrat team is crushed. Thompson is discouraged. Cecil Lake is sitting. It seems to me that the Montserrat goalkeeper does not want to get up anymore. He's so unhappy. All alone here in the Himalayas, and luck is not on his side today. I feel sorry for Mr. Lake. Our guys have the ball again. Dorji passes the ball to Wangchuk. Montserrat is in shock. They move like elephants... and the Bhutanese run around like aggressive tigers. This ball is more likely to hit the clouds than the net. The dog left the field. Where is the ball? And, here I see him, the ball on the left. Nice pass from Passang, James and Thompson are wrong. Moment! Hit! Goal! The most important goal of his career! 3-0 in favor of Bhutan! This is a sensation. The biggest victory for our country. What a surprise. Goalkeeper Cecil Lake is so disappointed! I feel sorry for him. How hard it is to be a goalkeeper on a team that never wins. The ball is on the left. Violation. Free kick for the Yellow Dragons. Hit! Oh my goodness! Another good point. The ball is on the right. Dorjee passes with the ball and passes back. Thompson heads the ball, but the danger remains. Nice pass. And a goal! The third goal of Wengei Dorji! Sumptuously! This has never happened before in Bhutan's football history. Our Caribbean friends must not see themselves as losers. There are no losers here. And the winner is football in general. Game over. We are glad we did not disappoint our country. So the long day ended, which riveted the attention of many people... from around the world to a small stadium high in the Himalayas. This day carries a message of passion, unity and hope... through beautiful football. This is Radio Bhutan. I wish everyone good night and sweet dreams. Translation: trubofan Paul Morris is now teaching kids soccer in Montserrat. Charles Thompson continues to work with the police force in Montserrat. Wengei Dorji still dreams of being at Arsenal someday. The Bhutan national team is now one of the top 200 teams in the world. Now get out of the cinema and play soccer with someone...
