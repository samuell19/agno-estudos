A RESTORATION Due to the condition of the original document it was not possible to remove certain defects during the restoration of this film. HIS WIFE This dead man is François. I just can't get used to it. It happened so quickly. It's unbelievable. François, dead. François who was always too hot. Oh, Angèle. Leave the windows open. My husband is too hot with the heater. Yes, ma'am. Dinner at nine. He won't be home before then. -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. I'm off to lunch now. -Hello? -Hello, Marie. It's Varesco. I recognized your voice. Since when do you use my first name? -I'm calling about Dupont. -He didn't eat lunch here. He's at the office. I'm in a hurry. I must see you immediately. -Me? -Yes, you. I'm nearby in the car. I'll come and pick you up. To go where? -Come quickly. -But where? -Come! -I have a conference at three o'clock. -That's what this is all about. -What? -It's very… -Important? Serious. But… -Explain, Varesco. -Get in. What's going on? Varesco, you're frightening me. Well? François! Oh my God! François! What happened to him? And why are we here? We need a doctor now. -Do something, Varesco! -No foolishness. It's too late. Let's save what we can. Help me. Leave him alone! Don't you get it? He can't stay here. Or he'll never be able to go home. He has to have died at home. We'll take him back immediately. Or we'll have to give this address and explanations. I didn't want to do it without you. The concierge won't talk. We'll pretend he's ill. Once he's in the apartment, we'll be safe. Yes, maybe. You're right. Who's place is this? Well, it's my place. Come quickly. Mrs. Flamand from the Bassi villa. Mr. Eugène, rue Montmartre. -Sir. -Madam. Poor Mr. Dupont. I knew him well. A long-time renter. There's no comparison, ma'am. We were in the war together. And we were inseparable. In retrospect, you could say that our time in the war was the best time of our lives. And I can tell you, of everyone here, I knew him the best. He was my friend. Hey, Dupont! Watch out! Yes. Well, don't be shy! Eugène, come here. Wow, she's beautiful! She's soft and agile. And sensitive. -It's like you're talking about a woman. -She is my woman. It's nice to make money. Anyway, this calls for a drink. Let's go. I'm hot. Are you coming, Mrs. Grandais? Émile! Call your mother. We're leaving. We can never relax. Respect! -Dad! -What is it? Mom wants to see you. Go ahead. We'll order while we wait. -Hi, Marie. I'll meet you. -Okay. You're handsome. Don't get dirty now. Mr. Dupont. I need a signature. The man with the samples is here. -What do you think? -What is it used for? Nothing. It's a souvenir. 1937 Paris International Exhibition. A gift. A trinket. Look at the prices, Varesco. So you're not going to Frejoul's? I have better things to do on Saturday. He's a nice guy but an amateur. -Have fun. -I'm only going to break in the car. Ow! What's wrong? We can't go there empty-handed. -Go get some flowers. -For people in the country? A cake is better. -A cake? -Cake is always welcome. -Ouch, Mom. -I'm going. -We should have waited for him. -This is my busiest time. He'll make it. Dupont is a good guy. He isn't distracted by money. You could say that he succeeded. It's not hard. He was a handsome kid. Coming home from the war, he didn't have more money than me. He wasn't even a concierge. He just married a rich woman. Then things took off. We've been friends ever since. War creates bonds and friendships that women can't understand. Excuse me. We know how women are. Your glass. -Give us some more of that. -It's my busiest time. -You already said that. We know. -To yours. Where is your father? -At the café with Gégène. -Go get him. Congratulations! And where is the cake? -Here. -Thank you, Marie. -Come. -Look. My son just got dirty. Have you no shame? Go wash your hands. You were with the concierge again? -You're informal with him. -So? It's not a good example. -Why not? -My father wasn't a mail carrier. This again? It can't continue. -What? -I want to return to Passy. Understand? -We're going to be late. -I don't care. For all I have to do, you know. Be quick. Get in. -Go. -Goodbye. Hey, Dupont! Be careful. I have guests. Clean up tomorrow. I'm not cleaning, sir. It's the storm. Four tiles fell. -Again? -Everything's rotting up there. -I'll call someone. -We've talked about this for ages. I understood, Albert. It's like the hill. I know that too. I know everything. -Already? -It must be noon. Finish up, Albert. Well, the Duponts eat early. -How are you, my dear? -Oh, a little horse! Is it a baby horse? How old is it? -He's 20 years old. -Will he get bigger? No, he won't. Thank God. Oh, Roland! It's a miniature. Excuse my wife. She'll be here soon. -Mr. Varesco isn't coming? -No, he asked me to send his regrets. Something came up at the last minute. Roland, Denise! Yes! Your place is so pretty. How many rooms are there? It's rather big, you know. The problem is finding help. It isn't like being in Paris. -May we? -Marie, come on. Go ahead. The rooms are beautiful. -If you wish… -It's indiscreet. Since Mr. Frejoul suggested. I'm interested because we're moving soon. So it gives me ideas. -Did you buy it a long time ago? -It's a family home. Janine was born here. Her parents died here. This was her bedroom as a child. The furniture is all original. Her childhood books are still here. She was lucky. When you've grown up here, you can't live anywhere else. In winter, however… -The cake. -I forgot it in the car. -I'll go. Excuse me. -Be my guest. So you live in the country all year long? I couldn't do that. I'm leaving soon for the kids but two months a year is enough for me. -Should we say hi? -Let's ask if we can. -Does she want to? -Of course. The big dog is gone. Let's go. Here, Albert. Thanks. Mr. Dupont, I presume? Janine Frejoul. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Roland and Denise. How did you know? I know everything. -Have you been here long? -No. Sorry I'm late. You lose track of time when riding. Do you ride? -No, I haven't had the chance. -It's never too late. -Can I ride the little horse? -Denise! Come on. Of course. That's what he's for. Don't worry. He's very old and calm. I learned to ride with him. Go quickly. You're too nice to them. It's nothing. A little cake. That's not wise. Your home is beautiful. But the stairs frighten me. My legs are weak. Mrs. Dupont, Mrs. Frejoul. -Nice to meet you. -I'll be right back. This way, please. -Let's sit down. -With pleasure. A bit of port? Just two fingers. Oh my God! Roland! Denise! Who gave you permission? -Come inside! -Yes, Mom. So have you thought about my project? Yes. But electrical facilities aren't our specialty, so it frightens me a bit. Did you speak to Mr. Varesco? Yes. He isn't taken with the idea. Well. I think he's wrong. Maybe. He has to be convinced. We can't leave them alone for a second. -You either. -We're talking business, dear friend. You have everything you need? -Of course. -We do. I'd like a bit of port. A little sip. Just a tiny one. -In Mom's glass. -Marie! -Too bad for you. -I'm hungry. Lunch is served. Lunch is ready. Sit here, Mrs. Dupont. Here, Mr. Dupont. -Thank you. -Denise over there. Come here, Roland. Your napkin, Roland. You know what I've decided? I'm keeping you for the whole day. DIANE Mrs. Frejoul. Come. Let's go. Let's go. I warned you. Don't count on Maurice. It's not that I don't want to. I can't. I never asked for anything. Look at you now that we've sold Diane. I never lied to you. I wooed you thinking you were rich. It was my only hope. My only hope was to marry a rich man. And there you go. -That was no reason to get married. -I didn't want to lose you. If I worked like Dupont… I don't earn enough to live here. I thought you'd follow me to Paris. -I won't sell. -You prefer it to be seized? I'll never leave this place. It's decided. I'll do what I have to do. Because I hate mediocrity. And mediocre people. That's perfect. I can only do one thing for you. -What? -Leave you. That's it? -It's the best I can do. -I can't live without you. You'll be unhappy too. We can't help it. Maybe but it's the only solution. First, I'll cancel with Dupont. He's spent enough time here. But that's stupid. He has all the money we need. It's so unfair. -Dupont will eat here tonight. -I won't. With or without you. What does that mean? You won't throw yourself at him? The head of Dupont and Varesco. It's very different. Not to me. Time is short. We have no choice. I have to sort it out. I can do it. But don't get in my way. Tell me you'll let me do it. I don't know. You have to, honey. When people love each other like we do, nothing else matters. Kiss me. Now that she's broken in, I got here seven minutes faster. You drive too fast. When Marie is there, I don't exceed 60. It's not worth having a new car. Would you be afraid? No. So why keep your old junker? Maurice works in Paris. It would save him time. When he's successful in business, I won't say no. People like you don't need that to get a new car. Obviously not. Maurice is prudent. He does fatherly things to amuse himself. It's a bit of that. Albert, remove my husband's place setting. He's not eating here tonight. I'll tell you a secret. Maurice isn't businessman material. He's a big child. That's why I never pushed him to take a risk. He left us this evening for some neon tube business. Nothing at all. But he's at the show looking at tubes that turn on and off. He's happy. He's talking. He's boasting a bit. By midnight, he'll have invented electricity. He's completely forgotten about us. Him forgetting me often isn't important but you're here this evening. Will you excuse him? I won't complain. The evenings must seem long when you're all alone here. How are the children? Well… good, thank you. I brought you the photos we took. -You remember? -Yes, very well. Don't make fun of me. Wonderful. Marie is cut in two and I have no head. That can be sorted out. -It's possible? -Yes. Excuse me. I don't like losing my head. How many sugars? Five. -Five? -Yes. One in my cup. And four in my hand. -It's for a friend. -A friend? Just a minute. Do you mind? -Be my guest. -Thank you. That's it! Now I can write to Denise and tell her it's done. It's bad for his legs but seeing as he hardly has any… Hey, Diane's gone? Yes. Is she sick? Is she dead? She is to me. You seemed sad and preoccupied this evening. We're good enough friends to ask each other certain questions. I know but some things are better kept to oneself. We can tell each other everything. I'm not happy. I knew it. Maurice? Yes. I married him on a whim. I was very young and very alone. My poor dear. I would never have mentioned it first but it's obvious he's not the man for you. Yes and that's not all. If you only knew… Come on. I'm your friend. Maybe your most solid one. -You can't help me. -Yes. Sometimes I can't bear it. I'm only a woman. I can't fight. He said tomorrow we can sell this house where I was raised. -What do you say? -The truth. I'm broke. Nothing you see here belongs to me. I had to borrow against everything to save face. Bit by bit, I have to sell everything I love. That's why Diane left this morning. I made these sacrifices willingly knowing that Maurice would end up working. It took a long time for me to face the facts. He'll never do anything. Today, it's over. I'm all alone. No, Janine. I'm here. It helps to tell everything to a true friend. Better than that. I knew it. You knew it? Is it really true? As if you didn't know. Janine, since I met you, you've meant everything to me. I wasn't happy either. For 20 years, my life was empty and I've waited for you. But you can't try to save what can't be saved. You have to build something new. That's impossible. -Why? -We're married. You'll get a divorce. And you? I have a marriage of convenience. You thought you married for love. Neither one was a success. But I have children. That's true. You can't. They're too young. I can't take anything from them. I'll stay at my place but you will be free. I'll give you the life you're worthy of. Yes. Yes. I'll separate from Maurice. I'll gently introduce the idea. But I can't live a lie. I'll only really be yours when we'll both be free. Otherwise, you'll come to despise me and you'll be right to. But we'll see each other, right? How will we do it? I'll manage. I'll call you tomorrow. I don't know how to tell you… I have to make arrangements. God only knows how I'll get through this. How much do you need immediately? Oh no. You can't help me with that. Janine, answer me honestly. How much do you need? To give you your smile back. Seventy-five thousand francs. That's fine. Oh, François! You're a bit nervous this evening. Go and rest. Forget everything. Let me handle it. Promise? Trust your friend. You didn't understand a thing! -I'll punch him in the face. -Why? For nothing. To apologize for not having left you the bedroom. For giving you the stables. Maurice! You can't speak to me like that. You wanted to leave. You gave up. Excuse me. I give up. I'm not sharing. But with Dupont, there will be no sharing. No kidding? He suggested you leave everything for him. And the children? -What's the difference? -Everything. We talked about it. He's an honorable man. He'll wait until they're adults to live the perfect love with me. -That's all I wanted. -I don't get it. -That's ten years. -Of what? Of peace. While he pays my expenses. Comfortably. -You think so? -Why not? I'm looking further ahead. Before that, I'll get rid of Varesco. It will be hard, but I'll manage. I can see the plaque. "Dupont and Frejoul." You're dreaming. If the evening goes like that, you can forget me. It's nonsense. Let's bet that you hear nothing more. The house? Will you go to Paris with me? If you win, yes. And if you lose? I won. Let's go. Keeping Pierrefitte was done. Keeping Maurice was the problem. The war arrived and we were separated for many months. It could have ruined everything. But the war didn't make everyone unhappy. I had nothing to complain about. This is London. The French speak to the French. This is our latest news bulletin. Today, October 10, 1940, the Free French Forces… For the love of God, open up. Open up, Albert. It's me. Mr. Maurice. Boy, if I had expected… Poor you. Where are you coming from? I don't know. Wait. I'll give you something. Here. Drink slowly. They took us in a wagon. We made a hole in the floor. I've walked three nights. What condition are you in? My God, your hands. It's the barbed wire in the yard. That's true. You don't know. No, let me do that. Albert, who installed that fence? The lady of the house. Don't lie. What's going on here? Nothing, sir. The wall was in ruins, that's all. That's all? I'm going upstairs. No. Let me warn her first. Why? Can't I go up? No. She'll be shocked. Your condition, the surprise, the… I like surprises. That's why I came back. What's going on? Maurice! -I'm sorry. -My love. -I was sure you'd forgotten me. -Oh, Maurice… All I could think of was you here. I had nothing but time to think, to imagine… I couldn't stand it. I had to know. Nothing has changed here. Everything's the same. Nothing less but nothing more. You start to wonder without any news. You were here alone. No, I was never alone. You were always here. You will always be here. -They're going to catch me. -No, honey. -I escaped. Don't you get it? -Calm down. Did someone see you? Follow you? No, I don't think so. Did you meet anyone? No. I came in through the yard. Don't worry. We'll hide you well. There are no neighbors. It will be easy. We'll arrange things later. You'll see. -You're angry at me, aren't you? -No, honey. Your jealousy saved you. Now you're my prisoner. All mine. That woman was his misfortune. I should have been more cautious. Butter wouldn't melt in that bitch's mouth. I recognize her scarf. Funny. It reminds me of something. But what? Do you have the screwdriver? Yes. There you go. Goodbye, dear. One minute, please. Show me. I had to make do. There's no more copper. Even with a voucher. I thought of polishing the other side. Look at the result. When the Germans are gone, we'll turn the plaque. Here. How is Mr. Varesco? He crossed the line near Tours but he's not safe. It was a bad time to come. I listened to London. It won't be much longer. We'll spend Christmas together. Mr. Dupont? I can't wait any longer. What is it? -A wagon of sugar. Interested? -I think so. Go ahead, miss. Okay, come back at three o'clock. Will do. Okay, that's good. -There are only louis left. -That's fine. No need to count. I verified everything. Goodbye. And good luck. It's almost noon. Shall we eat? No. I have to run some errands. Okay, the vouchers. I need to get some bread. You weren't too afraid last night? I thought of you when I heard the siren. If Marie hadn't insisted on going to the shelter, I would have called you. I thought, "Poor dear, all alone in that big house." I'm used to it now. You'll never admit it, but I know. And you're a bad liar. No, I assure you. And Albert is there. An old servant. I prefer being afraid at Pierrefitte and knowing you're with your kids. Can you see yourself with me right now? I'd never forgive myself. Have you heard from Maurice? Yes. He was moved to another stalag. I haven't told him about our future. No, Janine! You mustn't. He's suffering enough as it is. At least he has what he needs. Put this in his next package. We'll do better at Christmas. Our time will come, Janine. Have courage. Excuse me. -I have a delivery. -Be careful. Don't worry. I'll go and come back. I'm leaving too. I'm going back to Pierrefitte. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Sir, please. -I kept you waiting. Sorry. -Not at all. My name is Weber. I'm from Procurement Services. What does this concern? Goodbye. -Did you see? -Yes, it's terrifying. He had the stuff on him. I have to warn the boss right away. Obviously, but at first glance, no. -I don't see it. -And around you? Not either. I'm sorry. If anything, don't forget about us. -I won't. -Thank you. -Boss! -What is it? Mr. Varesco. They're far away now. We must see them. Youngsters in blue shirts. I saw the cars while going to get bread. -They were waiting? -Yes. If I knew the bastard who reported him… -Because he was reported. -He only had friends. You always have one too many. Excuse me, Mrs. Frejoul. Sometimes people forget themselves. I'm here, Mr. Dupont. If there's anything I can do… My poor Janine. That must have been a shock. Yes. Varesco didn't like me much. I felt sorry for him. I thought he was reckless. He should have become naturalized. His papers weren't in order. That's not it. His error was entering the free zone. He could have lived quietly, left for the United States. He could've returned later. He had important capital in the business. François, you would have kept an eye on it for him. -Didn't he trust you? -Yes. At least, I think he did. He did come back. -He did. -So? It's sad. -But we can't do anything. -What? Varesco got in the way of business but he's my friend. I can't imagine this place without him. No more than I can imagine the future without you. If Varesco hadn't come back and I had to be the only one in charge of this business, I'd be unhappy. What are you going to do? There's a bastard who reported him and I'm the one who'll get him out. You're not cold? You're not afraid? No, you're here. Yes, I'm here. I was tired of living like that. It won't be much longer, darling. I hope. I have a plan for later. -Did you go to Paris again? -Yes. So? Do you want to take a trip? It would be good. The sea. The sea? Crossing the sea. -Why? -Don't worry. If we make it, we'll have a chance. A chance at a new life, just the two of us. I'll manage well over there. Over there? Where? In Rio. In Rio? Why? Aren't you happy in France? No. -But Maurice… -No. Don't ask questions. We'll forget everything. We'll be free. I'm sure I'll succeed. I feel it. -It's impossible. The house… -You'll have another one. One I'll buy for you. You don't want to give it a try? Yes, darling, but later. Why? You have to take chances when they present themselves. Listen. That's Diane. She's gotten loose. I'll go. Hello? Oh, it's you, François. No, everything is fine. I went to see Diane. She's nervous. And you? You reassure me. No, don't worry like that. Yes, tomorrow morning. Yes, of course. As usual. Oh, François. How can you doubt me, darling? -Yes, naturally. -"Darling"? Is your chance named Dupont? I have something to say to him. Hello? Hello? -Well played. -You're crazy. For good reason! I told you about my plan because of him. You must've been laughing. Maurice! I get it. You love him. No, and you know it. You have to choose. I was a coward but it's over. I won't accept this any longer. I'd rather lose you. If you answer, it's over. It's an easy life with him. Safe. Go on, choose. Hurry up. What will we live on? I don't know and I don't care. Are you happy? Aujourd'hui, ask forAujourd'hui! Fresh croissants. Butter croissants, sir? -Fresh croissants! -Aujourd'hui! Ask forAujourd'hui! -Ask forAujourd'hui! -Who wants croissants? Liar. You're going back to him. You cheat on everything. You don't respect anything. With you, only money counts. -You were happy to find some. -Don't talk about that. Sometimes I regret coming back. I'm disgusted. I was better off with my friends. Friends are nice but not for your wives. Eleven francs a day isn't enough. I held onto the house when you returned. You didn't complain then. You're right. Go. Don't make him wait. Would you like something, sir? Cognac. -But it's an off day. -So? Thanks for the vegetables, Mrs. Frejoul. -Nothing. -Same story everywhere. No. Varesco, for example. He wrote to me. He's near Cahors. He eats meat twice a day and cake. He forgot prison and when he lived on my vouchers. I saw you in the street. I was very worried. Your telephone last night… You called me back? We had said everything. I went to see Diane at the stable. If you knew how badly you scared me. If I hadn't had to drive my family to the country, I'd have picked you up at Pierrefitte. But it's over. We're alone in Paris. And to begin, let's go eat. But this time I choose the restaurant. -I don't see any restaurant. -That's my surprise. But François… Is this your place? No. It's your place, dear Janine. The bedroom, the bathroom. The kitchen. Opposite that, the linen closet. The living room. And there… The dining room. Do you like it? Yes, it's marvelous. I… I don't know how to thank you. François, explain. It's an apartment I got for us a long time ago. I furnished it slowly. While thinking of you. It was a joy. I come here alone often. I read my newspaper there, quietly. With your photo beside me. I think about our future. It's here that I'll attain happiness and relaxation. I'm sure of it. Allow me. Dinner is served! We still need someone to serve but the concierge is taking care of the chicken. -What is… -That's nothing. Just a souvenir of our first day of happiness. François… Give me a penny. I'm superstitious. This is crazy! It's beautiful. What's beautiful is having you here, being here together. Come in. The lady is served. This is a very big day, Janine. To our happiness. Our first champagne here. I'll keep the cork. What a kid. I guard my treasures closely. That's why I made a big decision. Janine, our life must begin today. You're leaving Pierrefitte and coming to live here with me. Pardon me? That's why I drove everyone to the country and you here. -Why? -No. Let me finish, sweetheart. My children are old enough now to find their own way. Marie isn't a problem. The problem is the two of us. Because I love you. There are times when I'm afraid to lose you. François, why lose me? The war will come to an end. -Finally! -You see. I don't understand. You do. I want things to be clear when everyone comes home. That we have nothing to do with the others. With all the others. Aren't you sure of yourself? So you're not sure of me. Of you, yes. Of your memories, no. When you see your husband, I'm afraid you won't tell him. Or that you won't want to anymore. Absence, Janine… -What an ally. -Come on! I'll speak to him the day he comes back. So everything is set? You'll stay? Oh, Janine. This day has finally come. Yes. I hadn't imagined it like this. How so? François, I accepted to live separately for you. Up until now, we've lived the most beautiful, purest, the most honest relationship. Now that the goal is in sight, you're pushing me to give in. Don't you trust me? -I only worry about your weakness. -My weakness? If I had let go, I'd already be your mistress. Yes, I know. Exactly. Despite that, you were so loyal that I accepted the sacrifice. And now you're throwing that away. No, you're really hurting me. And you know me. I don't want anyone to reproach us for anything. Yes, maybe you're right. So what will we do? I'll go back to Pierrefitte and wait. We'll go back to our old life? Our meetings among strangers? Of course not, François. When we meet, it will be here. We'll eat here together like today. It will be delicious. Our engagement. Albert? Maurice! Maurice? Already? Yes, Mr. Varesco asked me. -He's back? -You didn't know? Don't bother lying to me. You know I'm taking over the business. Mr. Dupont didn't have time to give the orders before leaving. -They took him so quickly. -He isn't ready to return. Give me the paperwork. Do you know where it is? Mr. Dupont didn't tell me everything. Open the safe. Cheapskate! You took it all, huh? Get out of here! I'll remember this! Where is Mr. Dupont? They arrested him this morning. -They didn't? -Yes. Because he worked with the Fritzes. Varesco was here two hours later. -Where did they take him? -No idea. We can't stay here. He gave me orders about you and money but it can't go on too long for the business. You think? I'll take care of it. If you hear anything, call me at home. -What will you do? -I don't know yet. I'll see. Miss! Listen, he worked with the Fritzes. We can say it now. It may help. He gave us money every month. We can go see dad if you want. Yes. We have to get him out of there. Here. I got it last night. Dad wasn't mistaken. It was that. It was in his file. Handwritten but not signed. Too bad. -We'll wait and bring him to his place. -Thanks, Mimile. We couldn't do it any faster. Thanks for coming here first. Oh, my love. I had one worry, that you wouldn't be here. Me? Let's go. It will only be a bad memory. I didn't know I had an enemy. Don't think about that anymore. I can't help it. One day you said to me, "You always have one friend too many." Yes, for that poor Varesco. I came here often during your absence. I waited for you. And now we're together again. If you only knew how good I feel. You still need a bit of courage. You have to go home to rest. Let some time pass before thinking about us. You have to go back to work, your business. It will distract you. Of course. And Marfoisse, all alone. He needs authority so badly. If Varesco had been there… First, he would have helped you. François, Varesco was there the day you were arrested. He was asking for paperwork. Marfoisse will tell you. The child heard too. He was changing the plaque that day. And Varesco did nothing for me? A friend too many. Oh no, Janine. Not him. I did the same thing for him. That alone is enough. You'll keep him as an associate? Obviously. Wait. Don't be in a hurry. No, I think in your desire to defend me, Janine… And if someone brought you proof? That would change everything, of course. If it were true, I'd be so lost I'd never trust anyone again. -Oh, François! -Except you, of course, my love. You have to go now. -Already? -Yes. Life goes on. And your children are waiting. If I had known, I wouldn't have hurt dad. But it was good that he died. In yesterday's society, the one that's disappearing that would have been blasphemous. It isn't. It's an observation. He disappeared in time. So he didn't see what he couldn't have understood. The war is over. Why purchase these blankets? At this price? Vouchers are still in effect. And the damaged regions? Yes. Maybe yes. You must decide. They'll pass right under our noses. That will be a shame. Everyone in need. If everything was in order between us, I'd do it all alone. What do you think, Marfoisse? Well, a blanket is a blanket. We'll place them in winter. Go get the sample. And the letter. In the markets near the fairgrounds, no vouchers, it's a cinch. -May I? -It's you. Of course. Sign this before lunch. -I'll take care of it. -Hello. What brings you here? Mom's birthday. -I thought as usual… -I'd forget. Dammit, it's true. You think she enjoys us saying every year, "This year you're 40, 41, 42"? No, not 42 of course. But she's happy that we remember her. Thanks. Marfoisse, do me a favor. Go buy me 42 roses. The prettiest ones. May I? You're looking at me strangely. As if you'd never seen me before. My eyes have changed. I don't see you the same way. Can you tell me why? -Is this really necessary? -Yes. I think you've changed too. I looked at you before with the eyes of a child to whom a father was a man you didn't judge. And today, as you've been away, I see you differently. I thought you'd lived your whole life around you alone, your comfort, your little car, your Beaujolais. You don't care what happens around you. Aside from business, nothing interests you. No. I look at you because you have everything I hate in the world inside you. That's enough. I expected you to say everything you've said. See this portrait? It's your grandfather and my father. He worked for the postal service. Not as a director as your mother says. He was a mail carrier. The one who distributes letters, going door-to-door, whose feet hurt at night. He deprived himself so his son could graduate. And he died. But his son was gone. I didn't want to be a mailman. That's why I did things as I could, those that I could, that I took care of my comfort, as you said. But you all benefited from that comfort. Comfort that allowed you to continue your studies. To become a doctor too. When you have kids, you give them the means to make it as easily as possible. When you've condemned them to live. -"Condemned them to live." -Yes. It's that and nothing else. -I don't agree. -Look around you. Come on. That's what I'm doing. There are other solutions. Only those ones aren't for the selfish. And I'm one of them, obviously? Obviously. -Have you ever worked for nothing? -No! Who do you think I am? That's it. Because I work for nothing. That's why I wanted to be a doctor. If you were a doctor, you'd demand payment first. I never ask for payment. And I'll be richer than you. Why don't you become a priest? -It would be easier. -No, a priest gives advice. Last Rites. We try to preserve life. We're very different from them. We aren't defeated. -For you, a priest is a defeated person? -Almost. He's resigned. I want to move towards those we condemned to live as you say. That's my real family. Roland. You're 20 years old… That's the age you make choices. I'm done. Did I make you unhappy? -No. -So you were happy? I wasn't. I don't understand. Can a child can be happy when his dad doesn't love his mom? So that's it. I wasn't happy either. That's why it's my turn now. First, you need to know that since I've known her, -I've loved… -Janine Frejoul. Who told you? Nobody. You just have to see you with her. Aside from mom who isn't very clever, it's obvious. -I didn't think… -Of course. You only think of yourself. No, I thought of your sister and you. Of keeping your parents together. At least in appearance. But now it's over. You're speaking to me as a man. You and Denise don't need me anymore. Listen… Janine was never my mistress. But she'll be my wife. I'm 50 years old and running out of time. I'm going to go with her. You think you can start your life over at 50? Why do you say that? I don't know. A woman 20 years younger than you… It's as if I'm starting everything over. Exactly. You don't have the same tastes. You on a horse? Roland. You have to understand. Your mother was never a real companion to me. Maybe but you're the one who chose her. And mom's my weakness. I'm thinking of her too. She won't want for anything. Nothing money can't buy. What you can't pay for is the solitude of a woman who has nobody with her, whose children have left and who will be alone with 20 years of false joy and false happiness to remember. Poor old lady. There you are. I had trouble. Enjoy your meal, gentlemen. Roland, what you just said to me is serious. You just judged me with the harshness of your age. All things considered, I prefer to be judged by my son. I want your respect above all. I'm afraid I've lost my last chance. Take a taxi and these flowers and give them to her. I don't understand you. You decided to tell her, "Happy birthday, Marie" knowing you're leaving her. And you change your mind and won't go. No. I want to be alone today. Alone? With Janine? Oh, no. I'll see her in two days. I'll give myself up until then. What do you want? I'm not strong. I need time to gather courage. That's my kid who's leaving. He'll take the flowers. Marfoisse? Get me a sandwich and a beer. Maurice! Maurice, what is this? You can read. I got the same thing. For the divorce. We've been summoned to conciliation. I won't go. -You asked for a divorce? -Yes. -Why? -I left you four months ago. But I always believed you'd come home. Yes, a fit of bad temper. -I can't live without you. -You must. I see my life differently. Is there another woman? You don't need another woman to get a divorce. Your own is quite enough. Pretty. I did all this for you. You never wanted to understand. -If I had known. -You say that when it's too late. It's never too late when you love someone. Can you imagine… I had time to imagine. I don't want you to love me like that. The life I offered you wasn't enough for you. So I'm giving you your total freedom. Listen, what if I left everything? What if we go wherever you want? I'm going. The place is rented. I'm cleaning everything. I'll go alone as I don't believe you. I'll tell him everything. That I lied for seven years, that I only wanted his money. -That I hate him. -I don't believe. What can I do to make you believe me? Nothing. Dupont would have to be dead. I'll never find another man like him. A man who loves me, who forgives me. I'm crying because it's unfair that death took him so young, before I was able to do anything for him. Because even more than life, I owe him everything. Which nobody, no husband, no lover will give me aside from my wonderful father. François, take your coffee. Don't forget your medicine. Yes. Don't move. I'll get it. Honey is good for your throat. Denise! Thank you, Mrs. Flamand. I'll drive you, doctor? No thanks. I'll take the subway. As you wish. What is it again? The judo teacher. Denise missed her last lessons. I thought she spoke to me about it. She must tell me where she was. Let me deal with it, will you? Judo, a real invention of your era. Is that a sport for a young lady? We didn't invent our era, Mom. And if you go there, the exodus and bombing wasn't a sport for young girls either. Where were you? I can't tell you, Dad. Not even at Janine's? No. So it's a real secret. Yes. I didn't know you had secrets from your father. Even one secret. See, I should get angry and scold you. And I know what a secret is. It's heavy. It's hard to carry alone. So? You know I won't betray you. And it mustn't be that serious, right? I don't know yet. When will you know? When I'll have the courage to tell you. Do it. No, Dad. Not yet. Not here. I don't know. Later. As you wish, sweetheart. Denise, you didn't do something this morning. And that's very bad. What? You didn't christen my beard. Dad? I'll come by your office tonight. I need 200 large parts. What price? How much? That's far too expensive. No, I have to look at it. No, it's impossible. -Mr. Dupont doesn't agree either. -No. I'll be right with you. Come by the office one of these days. We'll go to the brasserie. They have music. Come by before the end of the year. Goodbye. You seem upset. It's not that I'm upset but… What is it? Is it serious? Very. See you tomorrow. Not serious at least? I don't think so. Yes but you have a doubt. Go ahead. I must… It's inconvenient. A lover? Yes. Unhappiness? Not yet. Love, then? Love. So you met a boy. First, tell me about him. How old is he? Roland's age. What does he do? At Roland's age, what do you think? -Student? -Yes. He wants to go to teacher's college. Really? We have time then. I don't think so. Look at me. You did something stupid. I don't think it was stupid. -So you… -Of course. -Since I loved him I wasn't going… -To refuse him? Dad! You forget that I'm 18. I'm a woman. A woman? Yes, it's true. I still see you as a little girl. I hope you're aware of your responsibilities now. Perfectly. I didn't come to ask for help but for advice. What are you going to do? You're finally speaking to me as a woman. I have no choice! I was waiting for that. Yes, but this is a bit soon for me. When are you getting married? Getting married? Of course. Oh no. We're not crazy. Well, then… What do you want? Marriage is a serious thing. Yes, while what you did… That isn't necessarily for life. Well! Your generation simplifies everything. We can't live with your state of mind. We take what life offers us as we don't know what the future holds. We don't even know if we'll be here tomorrow. Obviously that's an explanation. Maybe even an excuse. But believe me, these new principles don't change the results. If by chance you were having a baby… But dad, I'm going to have one. Come on. We often get the wrong idea in cases like this. I'm positive. You didn't want me to talk to mom? No. Thank you for coming to me. And for the news… You needed to know before anyone else. Yes, you owe me that. That makes up for a lot. So why don't you get married? Because you don't get married at our age. An 18-year-old woman can be loyal. But a 20-year-old boy? Get married and regret it? To be one of those couples in shackles? No thank you. He didn't have the right. I'm just as responsible as he is. We were both there that day. -In my day, we fixed things. -I don't want to. If I wanted Thierry to marry me… That's the name of… Yes. His name is Thierry. We talked about marriage and came to the same conclusion. -You have a way of seeing things. -Logical. We're very mature. We were too but it wasn't the same. Oh no. You're not considering marriage? We're not considering marriage. I had a hard time convincing him. A man that age is still very naive. Walk in his shoes. No need. I have examples. Who are you thinking of? Your mother and me? Listen, dad. I know I've hurt you. But what's done is done. We have to see things clearly. There are many solutions when you're pregnant. At least if you do it right away. Yes, I understood. And when you carry out an act, you must accept the consequences. You said you're a woman. Act like one. I'm against the solution you speak of. You took the risk of getting pregnant. You must accept it. In my day, we intervened in matters of honor. I think that honor means standing up for what you believe in. And your actions. Yes, I understand your reasons. But what do you expect? I believe in marriage. Finally, you're the one who will bring this child into the world. You want him to be yours, right? Yes. Do you already love him? Yes. Yes. I hadn't asked myself that yet. But after everything you just said, yes, I love him already. So keep him. I've made my decision, dad. No, keep him for yourself. Does it bother you that this child will have the Dupont name? No. If you marry the father, he can always acknowledge paternity. But if you separate, the baby will be yours. Well, ours. -But… -No, allow me. You can't continue living at home. I'll make sure you both have everything you need. I'll put you in an apartment that I know. Thierry will stay at his place. He'll do his exams. But he'll come and see you. I won't refuse to meet him or to get to know him. I'll be able to judge him. And to guide you. What do you think? Dad… My dad. See? I'm not too old-fashioned after all. There's boulevard Saint Michel. I called Thierry again yesterday. He knows we're passing by here at noon. There he is, against the gate. He's got his raincoat. Well! I didn't know he was a believer. We never talked about it. I wonder if, despite everything, dad was right. If I should marry him. Dad would have loved him. MR. DUPONT -I wanted to see you… -No. No, let me speak first while I have the courage. Janine, I'm going to do a bad deed to you. What do you mean? But it would be even worse if I didn't do what I'm about to. I don't understand. I'm asking you to make yet another sacrifice. I was gone for three months. Everything changes in three months. People, things… -You're imagining things. -No. I have three children. Roland, Denise, Marie too. I lost Roland's trust. I have to get it back. -As for Denise… -Denise? I'm going to be a grandfather, Janine. My love for you isn't an issue. You see me upset but it's no longer possible for me to start over with you. François, you have no idea. We're almost there after so many years. All of our plans… It was too beautiful. I'm sorry for sacrificing you for them but you're the strongest one. What will happen to me? The only solution is to go back to your old life. As if we had never met. I won't abandon you for that. -I don't want your money. -Let me help you. I'll know you're okay. I already signed an acknowledgment of debts. If I ever disappear, you can use it. -Oh, François! -You never know. I should reproach you, beg you, but that's not my style. You made this decision because you needed to. What are you going to do? Me… Nothing. I'll continue as before too. -Even at the office? -Yes. Varesco will come by later. I need a friend. He's the only one I have left. I know you have doubts about him. We'll speak to each other honestly and restart our old partnership. I see only one thing. I'll never see you again. I wish I had time to get used to the idea of losing you. I still need you, Janine. I'd like you to see Denise. She needs support and guidance. She's still young. I'll see her this afternoon. Thank you, Janine. So we won't spend our lives together. We should have just done it years ago. But despite the regret, I'm happy I behaved as an honest man. It isn't always convenient, you know. To behave as a Dupont. Goodbye, François. I'm sorry. For everything. -Are you ill? -Yes. No. I wanted to see you here because it's quieter. -We can't talk at the office. -Nothing serious? It's hard to say. Varesco, why are you so bothered since my return? Bothered? What do you mean? Yes. Like you act with someone you've done wrong to. Done wrong? Me? Or as someone, my presence would disturb. What do you mean? Imagine that my absence wasn't by chance but that someone reported me and that person is right here. -You're crazy! For what reason? -That's what I don't understand. -It makes no sense. -Yes, I've thought about it. If one of us disappears, the other gets the business. So? So you thought I wanted to get rid of you? Since your return, have I asked you to arrange things? No, I trusted you. But you don't trust me. I was angry because you worked with the Germans. It was for you, imbecile. -For me? -Yes. I could never have gotten you back without Weber's help. -And the money? -I gave it to a network, idiot. I can't shout it from the rooftops. And all the money I sent you. -Who fed you in Cahors? -So business with pleasure. Saving Varesco and Dupont's fortune. Not bad. And what blanket! Men are arrested for less. -You admit it! -Not at all. I'm talking about my arrest because someone reported me. -Me? -I never said that. No, but you implied it. Do you think I'm capable? -I suspect everyone. -Nobody suspects everyone. That's easy to say. We had some very bad years. We're losing our minds. I wanted to see you too for an explanation and so we can start as before. When I think we've spent ten years together side-by-side. And you think I'm capable of such a thing. -Of course not. -Yes, you did. Let's forget about that. I have a suggestion for you. We worked together and succeeded together. We have to continue doing so. I suggest that we start over again fresh. We can do it right away and not talk about this anymore. Yes, if you wish. I have nothing to write with. MR. DUPONT You'll see. It will be very simple. "Between the undersigned… Constantin Varesco and François Dupont, it is agreed -that which follows." -It was too beautiful. "Article 1." You bastard. Do you recognize this letter? Swear that it isn't you. "Let's just call it even." You wanted to make me disappear. -I'm sorry. -Nothing excuses a denunciation. Understand. Days of listening to footsteps on the stairs. -Hearing the knock at the door. -You did this to me? Someone still reported me! I was the one arrested in the street. Put yourself in my shoes. I'd rather not. I thought you had denounced me. For the same reason as you. To get your hands on the business. -It's human nature. -Human nature? Bastard! You dare use that word for such a thing? Take it back or I'll… What's wrong, Dupont? Come on, Dupont! Do you see what happens when you get like this? Here. Drink. Drink! Dupont! My God! Poor man! -Hello? -Hello. Hello, Marie? It's Varesco. -Since when do you use my first name? -I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry. I need to see you right away. Subtitle translation by: L. Bordelais
