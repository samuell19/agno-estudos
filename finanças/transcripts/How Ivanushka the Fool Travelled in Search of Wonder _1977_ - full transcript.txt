LENFILM HOW IVANUSHKA THE FOOL WENT AFTER THE MIRACLE One fool was walking in the wood And saw a hedgehog under his foot. Ivan the Fool bent over to say Let me hold you in my hand To go to my home for long To hear my new friendly song. A hedgehog got angry at once As fools don't get any chance. Ivan the Fool then explains He is not a fool for being insane But a fool for a very simple reason for committing no treason, for never saving up fully, for loving all animals truly for always telling hedgehogs what should be said to dogs - Hey, let me help you! - Oh no-o-o, you won't! - Funny you are, let me help you. - Don't! I'll kill you! - What? - I'll... Hey! - What are you?.. - Hey, stop this! You can cut a person to death with such a knife. Hey, man, you forgot a sack! - Won't fool me - I'd better choose life! - So, what is this? - A mug it is, but what about a bottom? There is no bottom! It must be for drunk guests, then, jocular dishes! So, "To Mister Mark the Rich from grateful servants". Well. But you know he's a damned burglar . Should I catch him I'd burn him alive! - Should I, should I, I'd strip him naked and tie him up and to a cold cellar And then I'd show a frozen devil for everyone to learn. - Should I, should I... - I'd hook him up and to the smokehouse! - And I'd... And what do you think I would do him? - You, Mark Petrovich, would impale him, I think just so. - Wrong! - I would... - You would... - I would, I would.... I would add him a thousand more to what he's got for a lesson! And would fire you all for heedlessness! Understand it? Now then, tomorrow I want grates on all windows! - Hey, where am I? Perhaps the wrong way... This is some dungeon prison, What? - Hey, lad! Who are you looking? - Oh... - Why did they send such a beautiful girl to prison? - Prison?! How do you think why? - I think you were just defamed by evil folks! - Hey, hold on, hold on, you funny, don't you ruin my prison. Hold on, why do you think I am innocent? - I see! - I can be the most terrible criminal! I may have knifed my husband, a hateful old man! Here we are... Still run! - I'll run, and they catch you - and will jail you condemn to servitude! - So what? - What so what? - I am ready.... I am ready to die for you! - And are you ready to marry me? What? - Ready. - Marry a fugitive? - Yep. - Without reproaching for crimes committed? - Without. - Well. well. So you are. What is your name? - My name is Ivan also known as the Full... - The Fool? - It's not what you... - No, that's a right name! - Well. Bye then. - Bye. - Hey, do they... do they feed you badly? - You guess! - Here you are. Little alms, for have nothing more. - Thank you very much indeed. - Not at all. - Hey, do you happen to know where Mark the Rich lives? - Hey, hey, gal! - Ivan! - What? - I've fooled you, Ivan, it's not a prison at all, it's... it's his own house, he lives here. - What? Why are grates here? Grates are to prevent robbers. - And who are you? - Me? I'm Mark the Rich's daughter, I live here in this house with Papa. - Wait, wait... - What? - Nothing! Give me back my nickel! - I won't! - How can you? - I can! I won't give back! - But I... - For you are a liar! - I have never ever lied to anyone! - You lied to me? - When? - Just now. You proposed to me. Here... - And you... And you said you'd knifed your husband! - So here we go! So when I am just my father's daughter, you won't even know my name? - But I... - Ivan, Ivan, but my name is so pretty. Anastasia Markovna I am. One who loves me he calls me Nastya, and who loves very much - dear Nastya... - So now we know each other, Hi, Anastasia Markovna, - Hi. - So we got acquainted. So now we can say goodbye. Goodbye, dear Nastya! - Ivan, Ivan, come back, you've left your sack! - Return it to your father! - Ivan, it is so heavy, what is in it? - There is gold there! How are you? I am all right, but are you? Have no sleep, no food and no drink since the day you got your gold back. - Right you are, since that damned day! - Mark Petrovich, go to bed, go sleep. - I just can't get right the story in full about Ivan the Fool who came on foot with heavy goods Being no robber at all for returning gold. And dogs let him enter. I don't know if I am sick or it's some magic nickel that I don't want to perish with my eye's apple cherish. Or is it really fool of mine To sell my heart for half a dime? Anastasia Markovna, Anastasia Markovna, but who told you not a couple you are? It makes a couple for a fool lad and you... Foolish gal. - Come inside for nobody to hear. - Nobody will, Mark, nobody. - Listen, my old woman, I had a prophetic dream this very night with a warning. - What a warning, then, my old fellow? - The warning that it is not a coincidence for a man to give me back my gold. - I don't get it. - Get us this way by charming our dear Nastya with false honesty and get all our riches through her to ruin me utterly with only rags to wear I saw this prophet looking just like me and having the same name, Mark Petrovich, Mark Petrovich! So what did this prophet give you some advice? He advised! To decide on my own! - So what have you decided, chap? - I've decided for you to help, my old woman, look here. You nursed dear Nastya and you are like friends, so you have to get rid of this savage. - This is. Ivan, from his gracefulness Mark the Rich. Please toast him! - What... almost forgot the main thing, this is a financial reward for you. - No. - Yes, yes, a hundred! Count! Count, count, there is light over there near the window, money loves to be counted. - Hmm, count it, count... - Let us drink to health of Mark the Rich and absolute happiness of dear Nastya. - To absolute happiness. Ivan, Iva, Ivan, hey! - What's up? I've searched for you all over the village! Oh, it's Nastya's handwriting! "Dear Sir Ivan the Full"... - She calls you like that? "I shall keep your alms in remembrance of your kindness, my dear Ivan". - Hmm, you dear. - She's joking. - But I have to warn you, my dear Ivan, that an old woman will come to you with an intention to poison you." - Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing, Ivan, nothing! - Give the letter back! - Got it, got it. - Give it back! - She's a mean scoundrel wants to destroy me, damned witch! - Who are you calling names? - Oh, nobody, Ivan! Don't shake me, don't get my last breath out of me! - So, "She'll treat you to sweet vines, but you'd better drink none." - She's lying in a written form, Ivan! - Shut up! You mob! You are lying! Nastya is just kidding she's making a fool of me trying to scare me But I will drink a shot and even more. Let us drink, granny, shall we? - Hold on, Ivan, hold on. What? I... I just got confused at all with all this. What mug have I treated you to first? - I don't remember, granny, - Here we are, let you drink from this one and me vice versa. - I can do that! So, cheers! - Hold on, let us do next: let you sit here instead of me on the chair and let me sit there. - You're pulling the wool, Granny, I see it clearly. - You said she was just kidding? - Kidding. just kidding. - So why not drink? - To health of my dear Nastya! Now why don't you drink, granny? - Let me catch my breath! - Don't pool the wool, granny! If you don't drink it yourself I'll pour it into you myself! - But I can't drink it! - Why not? - I'll see lightings and will feel thunders then! - No, granny, you won't fool me! - Ivan! - Stop! - Ivan! - Stop, granny! - I can't drink it! - I just can't drink it, Ivan! Go away! - Oh. - Hey no, granny, you'll drink it any way! - And I will! If I am lucky to survive. One more, please. They call an old woman just their granny! But when I was young, they'd call me lady! I am a poor little thing with no honour Though I am lady of the manor! - What; sup with you, granny? - Don't you pity me, Ivan, for I am not granny but a monster and a real viper inside. I would do evil any way! And there's only truth in Nastya's every word of her letter. - Hey granny, you'd better have a bite of snack! - Don't you teach me! I knew what I was drinking, and you escaped by chance. So listen to me while I am drunk. Someone has a strong belief that you are planning to marry his daughter and capture all his riches. - Is he mad? - Listen to me, no that you have money, buy a horse and a cart and go away from here right now! - Well, I will. But not for being frightened, and as for my dear Nastya... tell her she imagined all of it and let her not be angry with her dad. Tell her just like this. - Don't you teach me to lie. I have troubles with saying truth, but will never stop telling lies. - Well, thanks, granny. Forgive me for my foolishness. - For what? - I was a fool! I almost had you dispatched to heaven. The devil you dispatch! You are not a fool at all, Ivan, but I don't know what. Some fairy tale! For years so fast coming by With hair grey and mouth dry! - Well? - Done. - Was he suspicious? - Not at all. Such a full he is for drinking all saying thanks and regards to Mark the Rich from him and his warmest wishes to Anastasia Markovna. Having said and drunk He died. - No! - A bird? - That's not a bird. - My daughter! - Little Nastya! - Omnia meum? - Mecum porto. - Sine qua non. - Modus vivendi! - Stop this, please. - Gaudeamus igituris! - My dear daughter! You scared us all so much, my dear Nastya, Lying like a corpse looking upwards. My heart sank when I saw you. - Why did heart sink? - How can you ask that? I am your father still. - I know, - What do you know? - I know that you are my father still. - What's wrong with her? -- Oh, don't panic! The thing is as it happens from time to time that she lost consciousness and feelings - Well? - So, she regained consciousness, but still no feelings. - I don't get it completely. - Don't be worried too much, as they says that people without feelings feel very well. - It's cold comfort! They say, they say... She is my only child! Please, don't talk too loud, Papa. - You see! I will do my best to pay for any remedy for her! - Unfortunately, our science cannot help. She ca be cured only by wonder! - Only wonder... - Ivan! O Lord, it's you – we are at loss! Ivan. Nastya needs your help! Go now! Ivan, ride it hard! Ride it hard, for Christ's sakes! Come to rescue! - Go here, here, wait here, - Guess, Anastasia Markovna, who's come to you. - I don't know, I want to sleep. - Nastya, my dear baby, your guest is a wonderful one. He's returned from heaven to you! - I don't want to heaven. - Nastya! Nastya, my dear baby, he'll cure you as if by wonder! Guess who, Anastasia Markovna. - I see. - Don't stand like a mummy, come to her. Hold her hand. - You saved me, Nastya. I am alive. - I want to sleep. My bed... - I hoped so much, I thought... I guess the healer was right and only wonder can help her now. But where is it? Who will find it? - And me? Granny, I will! I will go to the end of the earth or even the bottom of the ocean! - Hold on, Ivan, don't go to the bottom of the ocean, But go into our Greek forest to my distant relative to Baba Yaga. She'll make no wonders herself, but she can advise on some suitable magician. - Is there anyone? - Who are you searching for? - Excuse me, are you Baba Yaga? - Yes, I am, I am. Good Lord, my brave young man, so strange of you to be really searching for Baba Yaga herself. - Really searching for! - My Goodness, here I am, haven’t heard a living person in a century living in the forest like a rotten stump an old woman nobody needs and cares of. So how can I help you, my dear fellow? - Granny, I... - Hold on, hold on, my son, I am glad to see you, I am terribly glad, but you have to call me properly. - And how do I do that properly? - It says that you have to say, "An old hog, hasn't treated to anything but asking for news, treat!" - Emmm... an old hog.... - Emmm... an old hog.... that's not like it should be! You have to sat it loud and ferociously! "You, an old hog, you treat!" - You, an old hog! You treat! - Now much better! A real pleasure to listen to in comparison with first try. So what? What do you want me to help you with, young man? - Granny, I need a magician or just a mighty sorcerer who is able to make wonders! - You are late, my fine young fellow, a magician, you say? There is hardly any decent mermaid now! Goblins are extinct. - Where do I find then? Can you advise me on that? - Still need it? - Very much! - Well, then you, Ivan, have to go over the hills and far way for a big tower there with a great wizard and magician named Lukomor. - Lukomor you say. But, Granny, who'll show the way? Who-who? You know who, the Mouse! - Here! - Oh! - Hold it. - Thanks, granny. She's got a guiding tail. A guiding tail? Just ride your horse to the side it points. - Oh, thanks, granny, but I have nothing to pay you back. Though I can compose an honourable song about you! - But nobody composes honourable songs about Baba Yaga! - And I will, hold it, please! - Well, let you. - Here you are. With great information lack Babblers just lie like these That she has a bony leg And many-many iron teeth. That she has a bony leg And many-many iron teeth. - They are lying, my friend! - You see, nothing! - Continue. That she flies every night In a wooden mortar in bloom Sweeps every trace she might Sweeps with her broom. Just imagine, just imagine, Covers with her broom, Just imagine, just imagine, Covers with her broom. - It's only in fairy tales, Ivan! - Who are they? - Those are kikimoras, Ivan, last kikimoras, not yet married kikimoras I mean, Wait a little. Get out now! Sing, Ivan, sing, my fellow. Despite great lying mass No matter how you test Creature's friendliness Baba Yaga is the best In all the world you bet Baba Yaga is the best! Oh, Ivan, oh. - Bye, granny. - Ivan! - What? - Help yourself before you go for sound sleep and more strength for you. - So where do I go now? - What do you mean where? At the first crossroads look at the Mouse's tail. - Thanks, granny. - Bye. - Ivan, Ivan! - What? - Please, call me one more time before we part, call me a hog, will you? - An old hog you are.... - Oh, such a fine lad he is, oh. - Fedor Ivanych, let us walk away a man's horse while he's sleeping, shall we? - We can, why not do it? We will walk a horse away definitely, but we will do it in a way nobody will believe in. Vasiliy, you will never be a real horse thief you lack imagination, you lack it. Walk a horse into the forest and tie it there. Then hide in bushes and look what'll happen. - What'll happen?- You'll see and you'll love it. - Good Lord! - Who are you? - Your forner horse. - What the nonsense? - No nonsense! - Where's my horse? - You see, nowhere. I was turned into a horse and now back gain. Back again into what? - Into... myself! - Stop your lies! - Don't get angry, master. Can you understand true love? - I can! - For this desperate unthinkable love I... But you will not understand me! - Please, tell about it! - Keep silent, master, please. I had my darling one, my sole love. - Yes. - And once upon a time some widowed sorcerer proposed to her. - A sorcerer indeed? - Don't interrupt me, listen. She gave him brush-off. - Well. "I can't accept your proposal in any way since my heart belongs to Fedor Ivanych". That's my name, by the way. - The sorcerer came to me. - And? - "Will you give up for a thousand, Fedor Ivanych?" - Give up? No way! - Give up my proposal! - And you? - I said, don't you buy love since it's not sold". - What's up? - Sorry, master, a habit. - And what next? - What next? The sorcerer saw that my faithfulness is unshakeable and turned me into a horse for three years. These three years have run put today. So here you are that I and you horse are one and the same person. - So many torments for you! - Well, not my fault! Love!' - Listen. - What? - Where can I find the sorcerer? - But... why do you need to do it? Trust but verify? - Not at all, Fedor Ivanych... I just need to see him very much, as my dear Nastya needs him. Where can I find him? - You can't. - But Fedor Ivanych! - I can't tell for if he learns that I've told his secret he will turn me back into a horse forever. And horses hardly live more than 30 years, - But Fedya, Fedya... - I can't! - Fedya, just whisper it - and nobody will know it! - You... You win! Give your ear. - Here you are. - Fictional District. - Fictional District. - Unnamed County. - Unnamed County. - Unknown Village. - Unknown Village. - Mr Nobody Knows Who. Got it? - Yes, thanks, Fedya, thanks. Fedya, you know what - go back home for your bride has been waiting for you in torments for all this time. Go Fedya, go. Hey you? - What? - You now have to organize a wedding so you'll need a wedding ring, won't you? - Well, yes. - Don't be offended, but you've got no money, haven't you? - None, - Well, but I had some, a hundred. But I spent the to buy a cart and you as well - as a horse. It's all that's left - take it, please. - What is your name, lad? - Ivan. - Ivan? Bye then, Ivan. - Bye, Fedya. - It makes a cat laugh, Fedor Ivanych, I almost split my sides with laughter. Inanimate person you are, Vasiliy. Where's the horse? - Here she is. - Untie her. Go to your master. Run to your master now! - Hey! - Hey... - Fedya! - Fedya... - Hey! - Hey... - Fedya, I forgot the county! - Fedya! Oh, what a pity, what a pity. Fedya, what's up with you? You must have second sight for the sorcerer turned you back into a horse. It's all my fault. Don't, don't you, don't be angry, it's all my fault, I must have not questioned you about it, Fedya. But you know what, you know, we are together and will not go to that sorcerer! Why not? Why not? We'll go to Lukomor the magician, you see he will help you for it's not hard for him to turn a human back into a human. Fedya, do you agree, Fedya? Let us go, Fedya, shall we? What's up, Fedya, go. Hold on, Fedya, hold on, Fedya! Wait a bit. Don't drink it for it may be poisoned. Sound reasonable for you? Wait, Fedor Ivanych, just wait a little. Here you are. Fedya, where have we come to now? Let us ask first. You see, the Mouse points left. Where have you brought us, my little Mouse? We've gone through all the forest now. Hi, my fellow, come to me now here you are, here you are now. My poor.... Well, they are gone. You are so scared, Run, poor little animal, run. - Your curly honour! - Ha, please ask this foreign man how can I help him. - Not curly honour, but His Majesty! Got it, you illiterate pig? - Your Majesty! Why are your generals so impetuous? I address you directly! How can they call a king's companion a pig? - And how can I help you, my companion? - Your Majesty, I'd like to swim to the other side to you to Kingdom of Far Away. - Please proceed. But you have to do it with my royal condition to be dry from soup to nuts for you to enter our Kingdom of Far Away and get a golden purse as a present. But if not dry from soup to nuts you're toast then. - All clear? - All clear!

Luka, please tell me, Luka, are there any ready-made wonders left? - Yes, there are. You know they are... Magic hats. - Bring them here. - Something else? - Something... Magic tablecloths. - Bring them! Stop it, Lukomor, son of Lukomor, stop it! Only the most barbarian barbarians do such things, only they! What do you burn? You only burn your magic labour! You burn away your whole life! - Right you are, Luka, my whole life. 'Cause my whole life, my very-very long life nobodey cares of was burnt... - Stop it, Lukomor, son of Lukomor,stop! You are the magician, aren't you? What are you doing? It's your calling... You are a shameless old man, that's who you are... Crying out loud without trying to talk about. Well, what's happened, what? - I shall tell you, Luka, the whole thing. I am at a loss. I got disappointed in humans, Luka. - What humans? - All of them! The whole mankind. - How on earth have you made such a decision? You don't even meet humans. You've spent all your life in this fortress alone! - Exactly! - You can't even imagine, all my youth, more than three hundred years, I comprehended incomprehensible and only after being more than three hundred years I started making wonders. You can't imagines what I have done! But people started using magic hats to secure robberies. All the magic tablecloths were snapped by lazy gluttons. And magic purses are hidden in bottomless pockets of greedy riches. Here's what I've done during my very long and silly life nobody cares of. Enough... Luka, make me the bed and I will lie down with closed eyes and go away. - Where will you go away? With your eyes closed sure you will. Don't be childish, honest to God! - Luka, you'd better know that magicians die when they seize being magicians. - Want to see a magician? - Exactly him. - You can't! - Why not? - You can't! - Why not? - 'Cause he's no longer a magician! - Why not? - 'Cause he's stopped his activities this morning, - Has he lost his senses or what?! - No, not at all! He has come to his senses. This morning he figured out clearly that people shouldn’t be allowed near wonders. - Why not? - Because! There are much more people on earth than conscience allocated for you all, got it? - Hey you, old man, you are talking nonsense - Go away! - Want me go away? - Go away! - So you want me go away? Go away! - So you want me go away? I am stern! - Stern you say? - Where are you put... Stern you are not!.. - Help me! - Help me! - I see, I should have already died and by mistake sent to horse hell. Oh... Hey, old man, this is not a horse, this is a turned man named Fedya. - Turned man, bewitched? - Yes, he is! Turn him back, please! You can't do it easily, it's like a trifle for you, please. - Stop. Who told you the horse is bewitched? - It told me, I mean he told me himself. - Who are you? - Me? Ivan the Fool. - I see. Here, here, so, so, I see. I see. - Wait, Fedya, wait. - But your horse, Ivan the Fool, is a real one! A true horse, a common horse. Yes. - I think you are lying. You are lying about it! It's Fedya, he told me all about unthinkable love and about the sorcerer who turned him into a horse and then back and then back again into a horse. Please, help me, turn him back, please! It's such a trifle for you. Please, I beg you, please, turn him back... - Sit down now. Si you mean you never sat on it all the way to me just holding it? - How could I? I took it for a man, - For a man... Here you go, and that man took you for a fool? Went your horse away and then made fool of you. It's all clear. But why did he send your horse back? Why? Why do you think he did it? - What do I think? I just think it was... ... conscience. - Thief with conscience?! - Why not? A thief, he's also a human. I am at a loss, Lukomor, such a loss. Dear Nastya - my good acquaintance - fainted and lost her feelings - got back consciousness but strangely not feelings. Acting... like some doll. Doctors gave up. Lukomor, please... - Don't... Get up, Ivan, get up, I'll help you. I will give you my inmost wonder, I will! Don't cry! Smell! - Hey, Luka! - He's in the tank! - In the tank? - Help me!... - Hey you, old man! - So what, have Lukomor the magician driven you away? Here you are, it serves you right! Don't touch poor old man! You put me into a tank! Like beef! Ignoramus! Let off! - I've found it! Here you are, Ivan. A magic slate comb. Chalk is magic as well, write your wishes and they will come true instantly. But don't wish in excess, it is the last piece of chalk. - Now I wish I'd be near my dear Nastya right now. - Dear Nastya? Well, I'll help you with that as well. - Please, don't be angry with me, do you? - Agreed! - Here you are with horse wonder speed horseshoes, stop! - Thank you, mister magician, thank you. Thank you. Hey! Granny! - Is this you, Ivan? -Me! - And the wonder? - I have the wonder, too, granny! A great one! Let me show it to you. - Mark Petrovich, here's a wonder-making magician to heal Anastasia Markovna as you asked, he's... - A Russian fakir and disciple of Tibetan Chaldees Ali Baba Eustugnees. - Hello. - Yogins and fakirs in their countries do a devil of acts by cutting themselves with axe and after that perfectly normally raise from the dead. And telepathists telepathize at great distances what one needs and what one needs not. but I have surpassed all of it and many of many-many others! Ein, zwei, drei! Closer thought, closer though, closer though! And now! Ein! Zwei! Drei! Seven-eight! My services are not expensive but paid upfront! Here, mister magician, as you can see it no feelings at all. - Attention! Calm down! Look into eyes, woman! Don't blink! Closer thought! Seven-eight, seven-eight.
