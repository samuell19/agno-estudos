Adapted from the novel Moon Split in the American Sky The September 11th, 2001 tragedy in the US has killed at least 3,000 people. Hundreds of them are Muslims. Peace be upon you. This is the most important day for me. We never know what will happen tomorrow. - It's time for me to leave, honey. - Okay. Take care. Get home soon. I hope you won't forget our anniversary. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. MOON SPLIT IN THE AMERICAN SKY 9/11 the WTC tragedy has caused many disasters all over the world. Since that day, the world was divided. We, who also became victims and often targeted, will speak louder to defend our faith. This is the story the moon asked to unite the divided. This story affirms that the world without Islam would be a world without peace. EIGHT YEARS LATER VIENNA, AUSTRIA HUETE IST WUNDERBAR NEWS AGENCY VIENNA, AUSTRIA Gertrude has assigned me to New York. Please come with me. We'll leave this week. Honey? Have you told Professor Reinhardt that you'll go to New York with me for a week? What's wrong? I got an assignment from him at the same time as your assignment. Really? What should I do, then? - You can go by yourself. - I can't do it. - You can do it. - I'm afraid I might get lost. Your assignment is usually harder than this. I'm sure you can do it. - What are you doing? - I will protest to your professor. You've been working hard for him. Now you want to take a leave... No. I have to finish my task. Period. - I want to talk to him. - What are you gonna do? - I want to talk to him. - It's impolite. Why are you doing this? I only want to talk to him. It's impolite. No. Are you hiding something from me? Where are you going? Holiday by yourself? You're so mean. You made me mad at your professor. - You are coming with me to New York? - Yes. - Yes. - I'll come with you to New York. Do you remember Stefan? He will pick us up in New York. He is doing his PhD there. - Your friends are coming? - Yes, they are. - When? - I'll pick them tomorrow. - Are you sure? - Yes. Why? Don't drink too much tonight. - Don't worry. I won't drink too much. - Oh, yeah. How long have we been together? Two. - Two years, huh? - Yes. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - Now what? He'll pick us up, right? - Yes. I'm trying to call him. - Where? He is nowhere to be seen. - Calm down. Let's look for him. - Let's take a cab, then. - Okay, we'll take a cab. - Do you have the address? - You do. - Do I? - I gave it to you. - Not on your phone? - No, I wrote it on a paper. Check in my yellow folder. We're having a date here? This is the monument of sadness. Where many people have died in a human tragedy. There were too many victims. Num, some of them are Muslims. People staring makes me feel uncomfortable. - Let's walk. - Let's go. Thank you very much. - I haven't heard of it. - He didn't. We still have time... to look for other places to stay instead of this zoo. Sorry I didn't pick you from the airport. It's okay. Staying up all night, huh? No, I prayed for you all night. - I pray a lot for you. - Good. I also pray to God to keep you from sins. Maybe God is too busy to listen to your prayers that He can't keep track of my sins. - Maybe you have too many sins. - Maybe. That's a good point. You are not bored of us, are you? How could I be bored by a couple who are never bored of each other. Unlike... You know. - Anyone want a drink? - Yeah. Please, sit down. Get some rest, dear. Where is my yellow folder that I gave you in the cab? - I left it? - Oh, my God. - You can't leave it! - Yeah, so... Gertrude gave me the only copy. It's my responsibility. - Calm down. - My correspondent data was in it. - I can't call anyone without it. - Calm down. Give me one minute. I couldn't even handle one responsibility. Chris' business card. Wait a second. He doesn't answer? What should we do? Should we call lost and found? Tomorrow, then. - Rangga, guess who called? - Who? Professor Reindhardt. He wanted us to call Phillipus Brown's secretary, Janet. They agreed to meet us tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. sharp, all right? The next day, he'll give a speech at the Westside Building. We must find a way to get in and record it. Don't forget, tomorrow at 10,00 a.m. Help me arrange that, okay? Tomorrow at 10,00 a.m. - Fine. Is that all? - That's all. You arrange that. - And also... - We must find it. Before I go, I will call and check the location. After meeting Janet at 10:00 a.m. I will meet Chris to get your folder. Hanum wants to write about the WTC tragedy? It doesn't make sense! And every data she has is in that folder. There's no interesting angle left to explore. Her boss told her to write about that. Theme, "Would the World Be Better Without Islam?" That is the question? It's not the question, it's theme of the article. Do you know why? Because religion puts people in boxes. Make divisions among us. - You are wrong. - Why? Money and power cause war, not religion. Take us, for example. Have we ever hated you? I don't know. We always pray so you'll be rich and successful in New York. I have read many articles about Phillipus Brown. It turns out he's very fond of Islam and he's interested in the Islamic world. He even adopted a girl from Africa after the WTC tragedy. After the WTC tragedy, he gave a lot of support to the education of children in Africa and the Middle East. - Why are you smiling? - Interesting. When the West destroys cities in the Middle East, one by one, he pours all of his money to that region. - Interesting. - Illogical. - No, it's interesting. - It's crazy. It's not enough to inspire me, Stefano Dolsky. Can you say it again? - All of it? - No. "To inspire..." - To inspire Stefano Dolsky. - Yeah. Who inspires you? Who gives you energy and motivation? - Dollar, euro... - No. - I'm sure it's me. - You? This is why I like to argue with you. Because you actually missed me. She doesn't want to be interviewed by the media. What should I do? I called her workplace, but no one's willing to give me her address. I don't know what to do. I'm checking Sarah's video on YouTube. Her IP address can't be tracked. Who should I call? She rejected my calls many times. She knows this number. You should eat first. How important is this article to you? Very important, Jasmine. With this article, I hope I can change the people's point of view. Thank God. You got it. Wait. Just give me... I'm sorry, sir. Wait. Hanum's folder's gone, taken by a Michael Jones. Brown has gone, too. Rangga, I'm hungry. Let's eat. Be patient. Mas Rangga, I have Julia's address. Where are you? - Can you go with me? - I'm busy. I can't go with you. - Sorry. - It's okay. I can go by myself. So you better rethink, is your question right for Phillipus Brown? It's the most interesting. Rangga! But not everyone's like that. That's why I didn't understand why he was so angry with me. But look at him. He lives alone. Every time he sees a woman with the hijab like you, he remembers his family who died in the WTC. - There's a plenty of halal food here. - So is haram food. There will be hotdog that doesn't contain dog meat. - You like it, right? - Yes. I like the halal ones, too. They say, if you marry a woman, she would be halal to you. She won't contain pork anymore, right? Poor Jasmine, you equate her to meat. Your brain is haram. - Peace be upon you. - Upon you, too. - Are you the reporter who called me? - Yes, I... - So you looked for our address? - Yes, I looked for... Okay, I forbid you to approach me and my family for an interview. - Julia... - You have lied and deceived to get my address! You know the way out! I'm sorry for what you've been through. - I want to write an article about you. - I don't trust media! You only care about interviews. You don't care about those you interview. My boss told me to write an article, "Would the World Be A Better Place Without Islam?" She asked me to interview you and Sarah. She wants you, as a Muslim, to say yes to that question. Islam, the religion of peace... has ruined your life. Even your husband was considered a terrorist. It made you lose your faith as a Muslim. You took off your hijab and changed your name, Azimah Hussein. If you don't open this door... I'll lose my hope to say no to that question. Okay, then. Maybe we'll never be able to defend our faith. This is the last recording of Abe's voice before he was gone. He called home. Azimah, please listen to me. Maybe this will be my last words. I think my end is near. Oh God if I don't return... this is Your will for me. I won't be able to hold Sarah and you anymore. I'm sorry, Azimah. We have to part our way forever like this. I have something for you. I don't know if you'll like it or not. To this day, I still don't know what he wanted to give me. Oh God, please take care of my wife and daughter. There is no god but Alllah, and I testify... - Isn't he Michael Jones? - Yeah. - Who has Hanum's documents? - Yes. Hanum should interview people like him. - You got a point. - Right? Interesting. Interviews from both sides will enrich the article. - I have to tidy up. - Yeah. Okay. Here. Didn't they just meet six months ago? - Yes. - I pity them. Why do you pity them? We're lucky we don't have to deal with this. Hey, Rangga! My husband worked for an NGO. - As what? - A videographer. That's why he went back and forth to the Middle East. He said it was work related. - What was he doing at the WTC that day? - I don't know. All I know is, he received a call the night before. And the next day he received a package. A package? He said it's for God's agenda. You believe Abe was one of the men who put bombs in the building? Julia, may I know... when the last time you wear hijab... and what is your reason to change your name? Every Muslim should be proud of Islam. Azimah and millions of Muslims out there has lost their pride because of the action of a few people who hijack Islam. Islam is perfect, but humans will never be. - What are you... - Hey! - Are you okay, Hanum? - Yes. Rangga's been trying to call you. Did you make it? - Thank God, I made it. - Good. Honey... Your folder is gone. Sit down first. But I have tracked it. This person has it. - Who is he? - Michael Jones. - He'll be holding a rally tomorrow. - Yes. Tomorrow we will meet him to get your folder. - And you? - I'll come with you. You'll come with me. Okay. What is it? - What? - I just got an email. From Janet. - Phillipus Brown's Janet? - Janet Jackson. - Of course it's Phillipus Brown's Janet. - Okay. What's in the email? - I got an email from Janet. - What's in it? What was it... Oh, yes! She said your question is interesting. And then? - So... - So? We are invited to attend Phillipus Brown's speech! - When? - Tomorrow. Yes! - Okay. - Okay, here's the deal. - We'll go to Phillipus Brown first... - Do whatever you want. Please? But you should be grateful, Hanum. Because you have Rangga. And he has committed to you. Few men are like that. You have to ask him, too. Make him understand that a woman needs certainty. Don't waste your time. That's just my two cents. I don't want to talk about him. Aren't you feeling cold? I'm sorry I have lost your folder. Why did you come to New York? - You only think about yourself. - It's not like that. Do you know what I've been doing, where I've been, and with whom? Do you know? I was harassed by someone. Look at Julia Collins and her daughter. Maybe I can help her restore her faith as a Muslim. - You're too hard on yourself. - What do you mean? You should relax a bit. I never said that I came here to relax. I'm here to work. My task is to show that Islam is a mercy to all creation. This is about our faith. I have to write a tendentious article. It's not an easy task. You should help me if you can. Don't just say yes. Cut it out. If you can't help me, fine. - Listen to me. - What? I'm taking you there or you might get lost. I have a work to do. Don't be selfish. I'm selfish? You won't listen to me. You are my responsibility. I'll be in trouble if anything happens. You want me to go with you first. I don't have time! This is your work. What if you don't get it? - We go to Brown's first. - Listen to me. - He's giving his speech right now! - Wait. I'm your husband! Will you listen to me? What? Come with me first. I'll take you to your place later. But I don't have time! Listen, you do your job, I'll do mine. - You are so stubborn. - We part ways here. Is that what you want? Is Hanum having PMS? Why is she angry like that? We have to go right now. Hanum said she will be fine. But we have to go there first. Rangga. Let me operate the camera, okay? You have to find a way to get the interview. We only have a little time. - This is for real. - Yes. Listen to the radio. There's chaos. I have to find Hanum. We split the task. You will record, I'll look for Hanum. Wait. If I record, who's gonna do the interview? Please, I have to find my wife. - I'm doing all the work here. - Help me. I'm worried about my wife. Can you help me this once? Okay? I'm your husband! Will you listen to me? But I don't have time. You do your job, I'll do mine. - You're so stubborn! - We part ways here! Is that what you want? I saw you on TV. Are you all right? I was worried. Let's go home. - It's over. - I haven't interviewed him. Is it recorded? Is it recorded? It's all there. Good. Hey, Rangga. We are the same. Jasmine has not replied to my texts all day. Similar, but not the same. Some men are committed, some are afraid of it. - Are you talking about me? - I didn't say it was you. I'm telling you. All women are the same. They are never satisfied with what they have. They always ask us to do something drastic. Like get married. If Jasmine didn't beg me to marry her last night, I could have slept well and not fallen asleep during the speech. - Maybe they think we are capable. - I'm not capable of it. Or you don't want it. Two different things. Have you heard from her? I can't reach her. I'm worried. Don't worry. It's Hanum. She can take care of herself. I bet she's with her interviewee right now. I'm not ready to get married. I still want to travel. I haven't explored many cities. Lika Medina and Mecca. I'm not allowed to go there. - Convert to Islam, then. - It's too complicated. I have to start fasting, praying, reciting the Quran. Fasting again. Oh, no. New York is complicated, too. Dealing with visas and permits. It's the same. - It's easier to go to Mecca. - How? - Just recite the Shahadah. - Recite the Shahadah? After that, I become a Muslim? But a place in heaven is not guaranteed. Here we go again. Hey, Rangga. Send Brown's video to Reinhardt. Don't forget. Why did Hassan go to Morgan Stanway? There is no Hassan here. Hussein, not Hassan. Abe, Hassan, and Ibrahim Hussein are the same person. - Stefan! - Yes? - Resend this to Brown. - Right now? - No use, Rangga. - It's not us who will invite him. - So who will? - He will invite us. Sometimes I look up to the moon and wonder. If he could tell me something, what would Abe say to me for the last time? Have your husband called? I don't want to... talk about him. We had an argument before I met Jones. And my phone is broken. Hanum. Sometimes we realize about the person who loves us the most... after that person has gone. After everything has gone. Separated forever. I have learned to forgive Abe. For whatever he might have done. We'll never know when death comes to separate us and our partner. Let that happen to only me and Abe. And no one else. Here. Call your husband. Thank you, Azimah. - How is it? - I just need to send it. - And done. - Done? - Now we wait for his reaction. - You're so cool now. Brown invited us to the Hero of the Year Award. Don't lie to a liar. Wait. Now you listen to me. Can you handle it by yourself this time? I have forgiven him, but he doesn't forgive me. He doesn't pick up his phone. Maybe he is busy. You told me that he has to interview Phillipus Brown. Turn on Channel 5. Abe told me that he really wants to work for him. You know, Hanum, this man has changed a lot. He was known as a businessman who's willing to do anything to get what he wants. Now it's the opposite. He's a philanthropist. Abe had worked in Brown's own Morgan Stanway Bank, right? Yes, only for four days. - I have told you about it, right? - Yes. God have mercy! Azimah, please listen to me. This would be my last voice you'll hear. I think my end is near. Oh, God, if I don't return, this is Your will for me. I won't be able to hold Sarah and you anymore. I'm sorry, Azimah. We have to part our ways forever like this. I have something for you. I don't know if you'll like it or not. We have to go there. How do we do that? One way or the other, we have to go there. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Honey... - I need you. - I'm the one who needs you. I missed you and I don't want what we experienced yesterday, which was like a nightmare to me, happens again. Let us not split again. We will never split again. When will we get married? - What do you want? - Marriage is sacred. And I know that you know it here. Gertrude, I have accomplished my mission. And Rangga has convinced Brown to come to Vienna. Thank you. You sent me as God's intermediary for Azimah, Brown, and everyone who was divided. Ibrahim Hussein has taught us that we are family who will help each other on the judgement day when the moon is split forever. By the sun and its ray. By the moon that accompanies it. People who cleanse their souls are very fortunate. Pass on greetings, spread peace. Because Islam is safety. Islam is peace. A world without Islam is a world without peace. May peace, grace, and blessings from Allah be upon you all.
