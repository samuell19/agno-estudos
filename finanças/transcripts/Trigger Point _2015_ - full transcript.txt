That's a phase, Annette. I mean, we were all rebellious and resentful of our parents at that age. Well, I wasn't, and Sarah seems to like you just fine. She has her moments. At least she doesn't think you're the Antichrist. Ben does not think you're the Antichrist. He sure acts like he does. Look, freshman year in college, I accused my dad of being a fascist. Marisa, your father was a fascist. OK, there was that. That was great. Thanks. So same time next week? Yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Hey, look, don't forget Book Club, OK? Friday. Only on Chapter 2! See ya! Annette? ANNETTE! ANNETTE! Mr. Prather? Ben Prather? Mr. Prather? Dispatch, this is Miller. I have a probable suicide. 10-4. See you tomorrow. Hello? Hey, Rudy.

I truly am. You have to stop being sorry, Dad. It's getting really tiring. I made you some soup. I'll go heat it up. Where were you last night? I thought we were gonna hang out. I had Dad stuff to deal with. And what was it this time? Rudy's again. I'm sorry. That can't be fun. Big time not fun. Is he seeing anyone? A therapist? No. He won't. Yeah, just like my aunt. We finally had to do an intervention. Yeah, I remember. It was brutal, but she's been sober 3.5 years now, so... Come on, Callie. We're already late. "Save the Cubberley House." - Hi, how are you? - Good! It's a total waste of time. How can you say that? Because they can't change anything. He's right. Big business owns the world. Nothing's gonna change if we do nothing. Like marching around with signs and shouting slogans? Which is really annoying when they're right outside the library and you're in there, trying to study. Do you even know where the library is? Yeah! Well, I admire what they're doing. I think they're trying to make a difference. But they won't, and then they'll graduate, look at their student loans and beg big business to hire them. Word! You guys are so cynical. And "word," Darby, seriously? Why is your girlfriend always ragging on me? - I gotta get to work. - I'll call you later. Bye-bye! Thank you. Hi! Um, is it OK if I put something up there? - Wherever you can find space. - All right, thank you. That's about the plan to tear down Cubberley House? Uh, yeah. So that Sterling Exton can build an office tower? Exactly. But we're gonna try and stop them. Good for you. Bye. Bye. Hey, kiddo! How was work? Same old, same old. Thanks for making dinner. I'm beat. It's the least I can do after yesterday. I really am sorry. I promise it'll never happen again. Smells good. What are you making? A couple of prime cuts of Kobe beef. Hmm? Dad, seriously? No, we can't afford this! Every once in a while, we can. We can't. We're upside down on our mortgage. We're behind on payments. We're barely hanging on. You can't just... Relax. I have some news. What news? I've got a job interview tomorrow. It's only assistant account manager, but it's a match for my skill set, and it's full time. Dad, that's incredible! How did you even... Remember Carl? Yeah, of course! He's working there. He got me the interview. Dad, that's amazing news! That's so great! So, let's indulge a bit, OK? Well, it does smell pretty good. Yes, it does. Hey! Did you call me? Nah, I just came over. Eat already? Yeah. Good. Brought dessert. I have classes tomorrow morning. Well, it's not tomorrow. [♫ Five Minutes by Scattered Trees ♫ I'm curious, Hugh. Yeah? Am I just a booty call to you? No! Well, then, what am I? You're... you're my girl! What does that even mean? I don't know. It means we hang out. We do things together. We usually just do tequila shots and then hook up. We do more than that. Not really. OK, um... ♫♫ It took the pain to remind me ♫ What do you wanna do? You cut the limes. I'll pour. ♫ I'm right here ♫ Cheers! ♫ Five minutes at a time I'm gone... ♫ Oh! ♫ I can't relate to what I say ♫ ♫ 'Cause I'm not myself ♫ ♫ I'm not ♫ ♫ Five minutes at a time ♫ ♫ I'm gone♫♫ Yeah, Darby does that sometimes, just shows up. Doesn't it annoy you? Not really. I mean, Hugh only came by for one reason. Well, you know guys. One-track minds. And you did let him in. Yeah, and I have the hangover to prove it. So maybe we're not all that different from them. God, I really hope we are. I think we're late! Yeah, I know we are. "I went to the woods, "because I wished to live deliberately, "to front only the essential facts of life, "and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, "and not, when I came to die, "discover that I had not lived..." That must be Prof. Miller's TA. He's cute! He's one of the guys from Coalition. Oh yeah! "To live so sturdily and Spartan-like "as to put to rout all that was not life, "to drive life into a corner, "and reduce it to its lowest terms." All right, so, who wrote that? Yeah? Uh, Thoreau in Walden. Very good! So at least one of us has done today's reading. TA's pet. OK, so, what is Thoreau talking about when he says he went to the woods to live deliberately and learned what it had to teach? Is he talking about a kind of Rousseauian return to nature, or is he seeking to connect with the elusive spiritual? Well, I think he wanted all of that. Catch up with you later. OK. Hi! I'm Callie, Callie Banner. Jared Church. - You're with Coalition, right? - Yeah, that's right. I want to find out more about your campaign to stop the tower. Cool! We have a community outreach meeting tonight. Let me get you a flyer. What time's your next class? Uh, this afternoon. I have a meeting across campus. Why don't you walk with me? I'll bring you up to speed. OK.- All right. City College has owned Cubberley House for over 100 years. I pass it on my way to work. It's sad to see what's happened to it. It's a historic building. They should be restoring it. Instead, they're gonna demolish it so a corporation called Sterling Exton can build an office tower. Yeah, I know all about Sterling Exton. My dad worked for Mannheim Distribution. Which Sterling Exton acquired in a hostile takeover. Basically, everyone at Mannheim lost their jobs, including my dad. I know. It was a blood bath. No notice, no severance. My dad was forced to accept a buyout of his pension at 10% of its regular value or get nothing. See, that's what Sterling Exton does. They identify vulnerable companies, acquire them, gut them and then sell off whatever assets remain. Corporate slogan should be: "Screw the little guy." Right. I don't want one of their eyesore buildings anywhere near this campus, especially if it means tearing down Cubberley House. Well, this is me. So I'll see you at the meeting tonight? Absolutely. All right. Cool! Hey, you! How'd the interview go? Turns out there was no interview. Why not? They gave the job to someone else this morning. But... Someone the boss knew, friend of his brother-in-law or something. That is so not fair! If there's anything we've learned, it's that life isn't fair, right? I felt bad for Carl. Carl? He was real embarrassed! He should've been mad. I'm sure he was! And you should be too! What good would that do? Dad, you have to start pushing back. You can't just keep rolling over and taking it. I'll tell you what. When you're my age and you've had your career and your marriage taken away from you, then I'll listen to your advice. Until then, just back off! Have you eaten anything? I'm fine. Look, I'm supposed to go to this meeting soon, but maybe I can just stay in, and we could watch a movie or something. I'll see you tomorrow. Next Wednesday, Sterling Exton is scheduled to begin demolition on Cubberley House, but we'll be there first. When they ask us to leave, we'll refuse. They'll call in the city or campus police, but by then, Ashley's team will have begun the social-media blitz. If you guys haven't joined our Facebook and Twitter pages yet, please do so, and tell your friends. We'll keep everyone informed on what's happening. Once the protest is up and running, our goal to is stay there. We wanna be a magnet for social change. I'm sorry. Uh, when you say "stay there," do you mean 24/7? Yes. You've heard the expression "money never sleeps"? Well, neither do we. We're gonna run this in shifts. Day, night, graveyard. One of us is gonna be there at all times, so what we'd like from you is to commit to some of those shifts. We're not saying everyday. Just whatever you can, so that our shift leader has enough people on hand at all times to help things run smoothly. So, sign the sheet on your way out. Name, address, email, cell. Once we've hammered out a schedule, we'll get it off to you, along with everybody's contact info, including our own. Let's be the change we wanna see. All right! Thanks. Yeah, bring him upstairs! Hey! Hey! So, I'll see you next Wednesday? Yeah, I wouldn't miss that. If you guys need help with anything, let me know. I will. Thanks. You know, I've been angry for so long about what Sterling Exton did to my dad. To be able to have a chance to do something about it, to fight back, it's really an incredible feeling. It's amazing how good doing the right thing can make you feel. Mm-hmm. Did you hear? They closed the case on Ben and his mother. A murder-suicide. I still can't believe it. He was one of the gentlest guys I'd ever known. I didn't think so. I mean, I know I only met him that one time, but he seemed pretty intense, like really angry inside. OK, well, he didn't get along with his mom, that's for sure. It's parents, man. They have a way of tapping into the dark side. Yeah, but if he did do it, I mean, where did he learn to make a bomb like that? It's not that hard. You can look it up online. OK. You think they've hooked up yet? Don't do that. Do what? Play the jealousy card. I'm not! I've got no claim on Jared. Next Wednesday? Yeah. See you later. - All right, bye. - Bye! What about your classes and your job? I'll work it around them. You're overextended already. You shouldn't take on something like this. Well, this is important. Our country's in trouble. The rich keep getting richer, and the rest of us just have to take it in the neck. Somebody has to... Do something about it. Yeah, yeah. I get it. I guess I can't recruit you to come to the protest Wednesday? Nope! I don't care how hot that TA is. What TA is hot? Callie's joining Coalition. I'm not joining anything. I'm just getting involved. You didn't mention anything about it. She went to a meeting the other night. Seriously, Callie? Those guys are losers. No, they're not. But this TA you were talking about, he's part of it? He's, like, the main guy. How hot is he? OK, you know what? This isn't about that. They're going after the company that destroyed my dad, and I wanna be a part of it. He's super hot. ♫♫ What is love but a constant struggle? ♫ ♫ What's the heart but the pounding? ♫ ♫ What are we when the tide is sinking... ♫ Morning! Morning! How'd you sleep? Good. You all packed? Yeah. When does your flight leave? I don't have to leave for another hour. ♫ What is hope?

Great! Do you think it'll be enough? It's hard to say. If there isn't enough to go around, people can share. Hey, guys. Hey! Welcome back! How was Houston? Houston was Houston. Mom says hi. How are things here? Yeah, we'll be ready. Hey, did you have any trouble getting out of Houston? No. Oh. Sounded like a hell of a storm. Yeah, but everything's cool now. Anyway, I'm beat, and we have a big day tomorrow, so... All right. Good night! Hey, uh, we really appreciate all the help. Absolutely. I'm glad to do it. See you tomorrow. Bye! Hey, Dylan! How are you? So, I wanted to ask you about your father. Um, was he ever able to land back on his feet? No. He's still struggling big time, and he drinks. You know, my mom tried to get him to stop, but she couldn't, so, finally, she bailed. God, I sound like a soap opera! Your mom bailed, but you didn't, and you can't forgive her for that. You sure you're not getting that PhD in psych? Sorry. I, uh, I've been there. Your dad's an alcoholic too? Was. He passed. I'm so sorry. Thanks. So, uh, we'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, see you tomorrow. Great. Bye. What's up? It was Dylan who called from Seattle. You're not gonna believe this. There are reports Tracy Campbell and her father were estranged, but neighbours had no inkling of what was going on inside the house. Neither Seattle police nor the FBI has confirmed anything at this time, but it is believed, along with the suicide note, explosives and other incriminating evidence were found inside the young woman's home. First Ben, now Tracy. This is insane! This is totally insane! What the hell is going on? All right. All right, listen. We gotta stay focused here. Tomorrow's an important day. Yeah. Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! You're trespassing on private property, guys. We're gonna have to ask you to leave. What authority do you have to ask us that? I'm Thomas Calhoun. I work for Chicago College. We own this property. We're students at the college, so you work for us. We're not going anywhere. I understand you object to the college's proposed development of this site, but there is an appropriate way to register that objection. This is not it. No, Mr. Calhoun, this is precisely it, and if you want us to leave, you're gonna have to do so by force. Isn't that right, guys? Yeah! We're not going anywhere! We're not moving! We're not giving in! We're not staying silent! Not as long as that sign is still there. Because we stand for something bigger. We stand for something better, something true! People, not profits! Green, not greed! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Would you like us to call in reinforcements to arrest them? No! That's exactly what they want us to do. The smart move is to leave. If we ignore them, they'll get tired of this whole thing and move on. All right. Your property, your call. You're letting them stay? It's out of my hands! We don't get paid unless we work. This isn't right! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! OK, we're on it. It's started. Hey! Hey! The protest has started. The cops just left. Oh, uh, great. Thank you. Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm... No, it's this whole thing with Ben and Tracy. I, um... Yeah. Do you think maybe it was like a copycat thing, where they planned it together? I... I don't know what to think. Yeah, it's really bizarre. Yeah, um... So... Well, I should get back to the team. Yeah. Thank you. Let's go over there. We can shoot that. - Hey! - Hey! How's everything? It's great! Cool! Hey! Hey, buddy! We need to talk. Yeah, sure. What's going on? Uh, not here, not now. After my shift. OK. And, um, not at the house. All right. What's, uh, what's happening? You're kind of freaking me out a little. Um, it's about Ben and Tracy. What about them? I... I don't know. I'm not sure. OK, well, uh, I'll come back at midnight after your shift. We'll talk then. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, see you. Is everything OK? Uh, I don't know. I'm just tired. Thanks. - See you in the morning. - OK. Good night!- Bye! Sweet! Yeah, it's great! You think it's fun? Yeah, it's a good night! No matter what the supporting army, the basic element in our success... Hey! You're famous. What are you talking about? You were on TV. The protest. Oh, cool! They interviewed that boy you were standing beside, Jared something or other. Jared Church. Seems like an inspirational guy. Yeah, he really is. You know, Dad, you should join us. Nah, it's a young person's game. This is about Sterling Exton. Don't you wanna fight back? I think it's great that you're getting involved, but even if you succeed in stopping this project, you're not gonna stop Sterling Exton. Right. Yeah, why bother to do anything when you can just sit around feeling sorry for yourself, doing this. Come on, ease up a little. You wanna know something? You used to be my inspiration. You were... You were my hero. I want that man back so much, and I see you killing him day by day, and that's killing me. Hey! Hey! - Patrick seems upset. - Yeah. He says he wants to talk to me about something. He's been acting weird all day. How so? I don't know. I just get this feeling like he's avoiding me. That's weird. And he's been on his computer a lot. Well, like more than usual? Yeah, a lot more. I wonder what's up. Maybe he'll tell me tonight. Hey!- Hey! Gonna let me in? - Not tonight. - Not tonight? Jeez! What are we, like, married? I still have studying to do, and I have work tomorrow. How'd it go today? Do you really wanna know? Were you with that hot TA? OK, good night, Hugh. Let me in, Callie. No, and please don't come back here. - What's that supposed to mean? - Figure it out. - Hey! - Go home! Any of you get hit? No, we're OK. Some guys have been hassling us. I think they're from the work crew. You think it's safe to stay here? Yeah. It'll die down. I hope so. All right, guys. We're gonna head out. If anybody needs anything, just let us know. Thank you, everybody. Have a good night. Bye! See you, guys! All right! Girls, if you need protection up here, I am here! No. No way. So, what's going on, man? Do you remember when Ben's mom was killed and they found Ben in his garage? Ashley said that she was out of town that weekend. Yeah, visiting her mom in Houston. But doesn't it strike you at all weird that she said she was there again when everything went down with Tracy and her dad? I mean, not really. I didn't even notice. OK, well, you know, I thought it was weird. OK. I know that what I'm about to say is gonna freak you out, especially since you guys hook up, but I feel like it's... Hey, man, let's just keep walking. - What's wrong? - Let's get out of here. Go! Go! Go! Hey! Patrick! Get off of him! Hey! What's going on here? Patrick! Call 911! Patrick! Patrick! Hey, Bri. So, do you know the guy? What guy? Oh my God! You haven't heard? What are you talking about? Last night, after the protest, 2 guys were mugged really badly. Hi! Hi, uh, Carrie. Callie.- Callie. I heard about Patrick. Is he OK? Yeah. Well, he made it through surgery, but he's still unconscious. But Jared wasn't hurt too bad. Jared? They attacked Jared too? Yeah, they were together. He... he was hurt? He just took a hit to the leg, but Patrick, they really did a number on him. So you guys called off the protest? Yeah, we had to. I mean, the whole point of this coalition is to affect change through non-violence. Coalition didn't do anything violent. But the media has linked the assault to the protest. We don't wanna be associated with violence in any way. It's just not who we are. So you think Jared and Patrick were attacked because of the protest? It wasn't a mugging. The attackers didn't take anything, and they were disguised. Who would do that? There were some displaced workers hassling us last night. Maybe it was Sterling Exton. You know, they seem to be in the business of hurting people. Well, I suppose. Is Jared at Coalition House? No, he's at the hospital with Patrick. Well, I have some time before work. Do you think he'd mind if I came by? I'm sure that would be fine. OK, thanks. Hey! Hey! How is he? They were able to ease most of the pressure on his brain, but he still hasn't woken up. The doctors say he's lucky to be alive. His dad will be here soon. Took him a while to get from his farm upstate to JFK. Do you need me to get you anything? Coffee? Yeah, I'd love a coffee. Come on. I'll go with you. Patrick and I have been best buds for a long time, you know, ever since we were classmates at Castleton. The prep school? Yeah, we met first day, freshman year, in the computer lab. He's kind of a genius at that stuff. He got his master's in computer science. We hit it off immediately. You know, he was the new kid. I was the veteran. I practically grew up at the school. What do you mean? My dad was on the maintenance crew. Qualified kids of employees could attend for free. Noblesse oblige. Lucky you!- Hmm! Castleton's one of the best schools in the country. So it's recruiting materials say. What, it's not? Well, it lives up to its rep, but I always felt kind of weird going there, you know, being surrounded by all those rich kids. Patrick's not rich. Sure, he is. You said his dad lives on a farm. Yeah, a thoroughbred farm outside Saratoga when he's not at his townhouse in the Upper East Side. Poor Patrick. That's Patrick's dad. Sean. Hey! Uh, no, no, no. It's the other wing. Just stay there. I'll come get you. OK. He went to the wrong entrance. I'm gonna go get him. OK, I'll, um, I'll stay with Patrick. Thanks. Ashley! No, uh, I'm Callie! Jared! He went to get your dad. I'll go get him. Danger! My computer. Matinecock. Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! He woke up, but only for second. I'm so sorry you weren't here. It means he's gonna pull through, doesn't it? Did he say anything? Um, well, he thought I was Ashley, and then he asked for you. Me? And then he said a bunch of random stuff and he was out again. ♫♫ It started ♫ ♫ When they saw her eyes had changed colour ♫ ♫ They tried to fix her sight ♫ ♫ But it's just got darker ♫ ♫ There is no room for light ♫ ♫ But they tried ♫ ♫ And she tried ♫ ♫ They came into her room last night... ♫ Um, I need to get something to eat. You hungry? No, I'm good. I'm just gonna sit with Patrick. OK, thanks. ♫ They counted her nickels and dimes ♫ ♫ Decided to wake her up from sleep ♫ ♫ With a scream... ♫ From the way you describe it, Jared's lucky he didn't get hurt worse. Yeah, he's really lucky. He's pretty torn up, though. You know, him and Patrick, they've been so tight ever since they went to Castleton together. Castleton? Those bomber guys went to Castleton. What bomber guys? You know, those kids who blew up their parents and then killed themselves. The other day in Seattle, and that guy from Matinecock. Matinecock. I thought it was New York. Yeah, Matinecock, Long Island. I have cousins in Oyster Bay, and I used to visit them every summer when I was little. You have to drive by Matinecock to get there. I always thought that was such a funny word. Matinecock. Matinecock. ♫ They pointed to her broken mirror ♫ ♫ And explained ♫ ♫ That's why people won't come round here ♫ ♫ And she watched their eyes and their mouths ♫ ♫ As they said: ♫ ♫ "You're unstable "Where are you going?" ♫ ♫ 'Cause you're broken and you're wretched ♫ Nurse! Somebody help! ♫ You're unstable ♫ ♫ Here we yell it ♫ ♫ You're unstable ♫ ♫ Unstable♫♫ You could stay at the house if you want. Ah, thanks, but, uh, I don't think I could handle it, you know? The hotel's near the precinct. Police told me they'll notify me the minute there's a break in the case, so... They're gonna find out who did this. You're damn right they will. I guess, at some point, I'm gonna have to drop by and deal with his stuff, huh? Don't worry about that now. Thanks for being such a good friend to Patrick. You meant the world to him, Jared, to me too. You know, he was the finest... finest person I've ever known, you know? With the purest of hearts. I just can't imagine what life's gonna be like without him, you know? - Hey! - Hey! How are you? Hanging in there. I got your text message. Sorry I didn't respond. I've just been... No, it's OK. I understand. Have they made any progress in the investigation? Not yet. I might be on to something. What do you mean? Remember when Patrick woke up, he was saying that random stuff? Yeah. I'm not so sure it was random. He was trying to tell me something. What did he say? Matinecock. Oh, well, that makes sense. You see, there was this guy... Ben Prather, yeah. You know about Ben? Yeah, it was all over the Internet. Then you know Ben was a classmate of ours at Castleton. I knew he went there. I didn't know he was in your class. So was Tracy Campbell. Yeah, I read about her too. That's probably why Matinecock was on Patrick's mind. He was obsessed over Ben and Tracy. Right. Why was he telling me? I don't know. He was so emphatic, like it was really important, you know? Then he said something about his computer. Do you think there's something on it that he wanted me or you to know about? He couldn't believe Ben and Tracy planted those bombs. Ashley said he was on his computer a lot that day. Maybe he had discovered something and... And he was trying to tell me. Yeah. I'm gonna scope out his computer, see if I can find anything. OK. Thanks. Four, three, two, one and liftoff! Liftoff!

Yeah, I don't want you to be here, either, but you have to be. No, I'm... I'm going to... You have to be! I don't wanna lose you. You're not gonna lose me. I will if you keep drinking. How... how long do I have to stay here? Until you're better. We... we can't afford this. It's a charity. Is that what I've become, a charity case? No! You're my dad, and I love you and I want you to get healthy. You, uh, you haven't answered any of my calls or texts, so... What do you want, Hugh? I wanna talk. I know I can be a jerk sometimes... - Please don't. - And I'm sorry. I'll try to do better. I... I don't want us to break up. You don't take me seriously. Yes, I do.- No, you don't! You don't take anything seriously, and I don't wanna be with someone like that. OK, well, give me a chance. I can change. You're a boy, Hugh. I already have one boy in my life, and I just put him in rehab. I don't need another. It's not about that. Screw you, Callie! Sorry, I didn't mean to, uh... It's OK. How did you... I got your address off the Coalition call sheet. Oh, right. I wouldn't have just dropped by, but I didn't think I should call or text you. What is it? What's wrong? You were right. Patrick was trying to warn you, or, rather, he was trying to warn me. About what? Ben and Tracy didn't kill themselves. They were murdered. Patrick was starting to figure it out and... She might have murdered him too. Who? Ashley. The week Ben's mom was killed, Ashley wasn't in Houston visiting her mom. She was in New York. And last week, when Tracy and her Dad were killed, Ashley said she was visiting her mom again, but she wasn't. She flew to Seattle. Check it out. Patrick was just starting to tell me all of this the night we were attacked. How did he get this information? He hacked into her email. Piece of cake for him. She didn't bother to cover her tracks? Well, she didn't think anyone was on her trail. And there's one more thing. The night of the attack, Ashley left the house at around 11:00 p.m. She didn't come back all night. Oh my God! I called the FBI. There's an agent on his way now. You can just call the FBI? We couldn't talk to him at the Coalition House, and I need you to tell him what Patrick said to you in the hospital. Right. Why would she do something so horrifying? What did she have against Ben and Tracy? Did she go to Castleton too? No, but she had met both of them, and she has a real thing about trust-fund kids who play at being activists and then sell out as soon as it becomes convenient. Did Ben and Tracy do that? They never had the chance. Neither did Patrick. Patrick was a trust-fund kid too. Yeah. But why would she kill them? Miss Banner? Mr. Church? Kieran Conner, FBI. Hi! Yeah, come in. Well, this really isn't evidence. Circumstantial, at best. But she lied about being in New York and Seattle. There are a lot of reasons why people lie or keep secrets. Maybe she has a boyfriend she doesn't want you to know about. What about Patrick's warning? From how you described it, "warning" is just an interpretation of what he said. So you're not gonna do anything about this? I didn't say that. And I'll coordinate with our agents in New York and Seattle. Shouldn't you at least bring her in for questioning or something? At this point, that would be a bad idea, especially if she's guilty. But she killed my best friend! If that turns out to be true, it's all the more reason to proceed carefully. Unless, of course, you suspect she's planning to attack someone else. I mean, how are we supposed to know that? Let me ask you this: If what you suspect is true, any idea who's working with her? She couldn't have acted alone. No idea. Someone in Coalition? All of us were at the house the day that Tracy and her dad died. And when you and Patrick were attacked? Most of us were at the protest site. And where were you? I... I was here, asleep. Can anyone verify that? N-no, I guess not. Just making a point. It's easy to be suspicious. What we need is hard evidence. Keep your eyes and ears open. If you come up with something more concrete, call me immediately. I guess it was crazy to think they'd just go and arrest her, but I don't know, this whole being-in-limbo thing, it just feels really weird. "Keep your eyes and ears open." That means me. I live in the same house as her. Do you think she knows you're on to her? I don't think so. I hope not. I'm sure as hell not looking forward to going back to the house later on tonight, that's for sure. Then don't. Stay here. Hey, I'm sorry I dragged you into this. You didn't. ♫♫ I heard you rode the lightening ♫ ♫ Crashed like thunder ♫ ♫ You tried to lift the world ♫ ♫ Is it any wonder ♫ ♫ The weight upon your shoulders ♫ ♫ Pulled you under? ♫ ♫ Put your ear to the ground ♫ ♫ Yes, I'm homeward bound ♫ ♫ I won't be long ♫ ♫ Put your ear to the ground ♫ ♫ Far off in the distance ♫ ♫ I'm running home to you♫♫ I'll see what I can find back at the house. I'm just gonna have to be careful. What can I do to help? You've done more than enough already. Look, I don't have work today. I just have one morning class, and then, I have to drop some stuff with my dad. Where did you admit him? St. Madeleine. I hear that's a really great program. You know, Ashley barely knows me. She didn't even remember my name. She would never suspect me of being on to her. OK, so what are you saying? Well, after I'm done with my dad, I can stake out the house, and if she goes somewhere or sees someone, I can follow her. No, absolutely not. It's too dangerous. You're going back there. That's dangerous, too, on all kinds of levels. If I don't go back, she'll think something's up. It'll look suspicious. Well, I'm not just gonna stand by. She does go out just about everyday to a Pilates class across town. At least she says she does. She always takes the same bus. Oh, hey, sweetheart! Hey! I brought you some, uh, clothes and toiletries and stuff. Thanks. How's it going? A walk in the park. It'll get better. That's what they keep telling me. Something's worrying you. What is it? Oh, you know, the usual. School, work, my crazy old man. That boy, Hugh? No. We broke up. My idea. Good! I never liked him. You're not supposed to say that, you know? What if we get back together? Yeah, well, don't. Actually, I'm, uh, I'm kind of seeing someone new. That guy from the protest. Yeah, Jared Church. Yeah, well, bring him by my new digs, introduce him to me. Better yet, I'll bring him by the house when you come home, which is going to be soon. Don't put too much faith in your crazy old man. Too late. I already have. Come on. Let's get your stuff up to your room. She just left. This is lame, dude. If she's gonna blow off your calls and texts, go see her. I did! She's with that guy. What guy? Super-hot TA. What do you mean "with him?" He was coming to the house to see her. Really? Like you didn't know they've been hooking up. I don't know anything, Hugh. Callie hasn't breathed a word. I thought she told you everything. I thought so too. - Catch you later, babe. - Bye. Hi, this is Callie. Leave a message. Has she been back? No. Did you touch anything? Uh, just the doorknob. You can leave that here. Wow! You wanted evidence. You think this will do? Oh yeah. They think a cell phone detonated the bomb that killed Annette Prather. We know it did. It's a technique terrorists developed. Extremely easy to rig up and pull off. Well, it looks like she's making a new bomb. It sure does. It's OK. No bomb attached to this one. Anderson, hi! I'm there now. More than enough. It's pretty overwhelming. OK, I'll wait here. Forensics is on the way. I gotta stop doing that. It's Jared. Hey! I got your voicemail. You found evidence? Yeah, a lot. It's like her lair or something. All right. Things are breaking open fast. Sean called. An eye-witness may be able to ID the car Patrick's attackers were driving. That's great! I'm headed downtown to look at photos of suspects. Can you meet us there? They'll wanna hear all about Ashley. Yeah, of course. Just text the address. - OK. - OK, bye. Thank you, Miss Banner. You put yourself at risk here, and the Bureau appreciates it. We'll need you to make a statement when the time is right. Yeah, of course. Just let me know. Thank you. Bye.- Bye. Everything's loaded up, ready to go. This is your script. I scavenged a house key. This is a copy. Why are you nervous? I'm not. Why are you nervous? We're moving too fast. She's on to us just like Patrick was. We have to take action now. Yeah, but it's never you who takes it, is it? Are you gonna run away from this? No! I always do what you want. Good, then do it now. Go. Go! Sorry. "By the time you read this, "it will all be over. "People will ask you why I did it. "They shouldn't. "Sterling Exton destroyed my father." "It destroyed my family.

By the time you read this, it will be all over. People will ask you why I did it. Sterling Exton destroyed my father. Today, I've committed such an act. Let the revolution begin. Callie Banner. Hello? It's Dad! Um, you know that boy you're seeing, Jared Church? Well, someone, I'm guessing is his brother, just attacked me in my room here. What? He ambushed me, put a pillowcase over my head! I think he meant to kill me. What are you talking about? Have you been drinking? No, not a drop! Why would he do that? Well, who? Kieran. Kieran Church. Everyone get back! Get back! It's a bomb! Callie! Callie! Get back! Get away! Get back! It's a bomb! What? Aaah! Dad! Oh, Callie! You all right? We got disconnected. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh! What did you do? What the hell did you do, you stupid, clueless little child! You said you wanted to make a difference! You're just a liar and a coward! - Hey! - You're a traitor! - Let go! - You're a traitor! Traitor! Traitor! We know what you've done, Jared, or what you've had others do for you. Ashley told us everything. And you believe her? You must have a pretty powerful hold on her for her to kill for you. Come on, man, whatever she's been telling you, she's lying. Well, your brother corroborated it. I doubt that. But even if he has, you won't find any corroborating evidence. We already have. I don't believe that either. Why did you do it, Jared? Ben Prather and Tracy Campbell were your friends. Were they? Well, you were in the same political action group in school. True, but then they grew up and left their activism behind to follow in the footsteps of their parents. Is that why you had 'em killed? And their parents? Traitors to the cause? They killed themselves and murdered their parents. But don't you watch the news? I don't know, maybe they were right to, because sooner or later, they would've choked to death on their own greed. And how about Patrick Owens? Did you kill him, or rather, finish the job that Ashley and your brother started? Because Callie Banner says Patrick really was your friend. He was. - Loyal to the cause? - Very. It must've been hard seeing him attacked like that, and watching him die. Maybe it was a blessing. It was just a matter of time before the call of all that family money drew him away. It always does. I don't think that Patrick wanted to live like that. Yeah. And what about Callie? Callie? Yeah. Well, Callie's different. She's not like the rest of them. Miss Banner, you've kept an extremely low profile since the incident. Do you feel ready to talk about it now? Uh, no, especially in light of the ongoing criminal investigation. You do know people are calling you a hero? I'm not a hero. I'm just glad and really lucky that no one got hurt. So, you're not talking about the incident, but will you tell us why you're here today? Because the battle isn't over. You consider yourself the leader of this battle? No. No, not at all. I'm just an ordinary citizen of a great country that's lost its way, and I just wanna help make a difference. If you'll excuse me... We all wanna make a difference, don't we, guys? Yeah! And we're not leaving here, we're not moving, we're not staying silent as long as that sign is still here! Stand for something bigger! Yeah! - Something better! - Yeah! People, not profits! Green, not greed! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House! Stop the tower! Save Cubberley House!
