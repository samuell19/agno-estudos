Is Mister Renaud there yet? Not yet Madam, but there is a patient with no appointment for a while. Make him come back. He says he needs to see you this morning. He can come then. You don't come to fetch him? Come in. Yes? Hello (male) doctor. I am a (female) doctor, of medicine. Is it important we call you (female) doctor? It's important to call people by their name. But you can also call me Madam. Yes Madam. I only take patients with appointments. This couldn't wait. Who gave you my details? I saw the plate when passing by. Sit down. My secretary should have given you a form to fill in. I refused. Is it an anonymous consultation? Yes. What are you suffering from? It is not something simple. Sickness is never simple. I will shock you. Nothing shocks me. Nothing? The other day a man told me he was pregnant. At least it's natural. You think so... What did you do with him? I sent him to the obstetrician. But me... Depending on what you tell me I will send you to this or that specialist. I am werewolf. Would you like me to send you to a psychiatrist or a vet? Either one of them would be useless. Then medicine can't do anything for you. Even the doctor in front of me? I have other clients that are waiting for me. The waiting room was empty. You're wasting my time. As a doctor you're not allowed to throw me outside. I'm listening. We don't know werewolves well. Not if we read comic books. You say so... I don't have the pretension to educate you, but I would like to invite you to a little show. What kind? What am I now? I have no idea. What do you see? A young man... I look like a man... young too... you can see me become something else. When? Tonight. I suppose the moon will be full... Yes. Where do you want me to come? At the Green Man Forest. In the depths of the undergrowth? No. You just have to go to the end of the alley that starts from the city. At what time? At midnight. Obviously... Do you know who is the Green Man? No. It's a ghost. I've already seen him. Is he looking for a doctor? No. His purgatory is somewhere else. I'll examine you. Put yourself bare-chested and lay down on the table. Your heart is normal. I am not. I will osculate you. You won't find anything. Don't touch my belly. It's here that secrets hide. I am not pregnant. I can tell. But I do feel a [...]. It's the doctor (female) who feels the pain. She sometimes shares it. I feel a spiritual pain. But you're examining my body. Yes. Are you ticklish? Werewolves don't laugh. They do. They do. Will you come? Probably. If you're not on time it will be too late I'm early more often than not. At midnight. It's the masked ball? I put it on out of modesty. Out of modesty? I'm naked. I'm used to seeing people naked. People, yes. I warn you I've been a judo champion. This must be very useful in your work. When pregnant men do hysteria crisis. Yes... Tonight though... it will be useless. What are you doing? A fire... for the light... and to protect you. Protect me? He will be scared of the fire. Very scared. Who? Him. How do you call yourself? We called me Luco... but that wasn't my name. What's your name? We always called me Luco. At the start of puberty... before my first transformation... I started to do hair crisis on nights of full moon. Then the next day the hairs would fall... so my parents took me to consult a dermatologist. What did he say? That it wasn't important. That it was the sap that was rising... and that once I had reached... That you would have reached? Careful. It's starting now. What you have is epilepsy. Wait... Can you hear me? Yes... So everything's ok. This is what I am... You are a man. No... No. Rightly so, speak, no? I will destroy you... I will cure you. The fire protects you... You know the name of the fire. So what? You are a man! Give me your hand! I don't have hands anymore Your hand! It's the name of the hand. Give! Give! You can go for lunch Mrs. Jeannot. I'll pass by the hospital. There is still a patient... with no appointment. - Who? - He already came. Tell him to come in... without knocking Yes Madam. And you can leave. I'm happy to see you. You are hurt. It's nothing. I even manage to osculate patients. I'm glad. I was wrong to leave you last night. No... It was very dangerous. What will you do? Leave. But I wanted to see you before. Why leave? I always leave. Why not try something else? This time I'm leaving to look. To look for what? My name. I would have liked you to stay. For what reason? I would have liked to be your medicine. You are. I would have liked to give you something. You gave it to me. Medicine cures the soul. The body follows. Farewell.
