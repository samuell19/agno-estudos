It's Pete Sandidge's squadron. I'll bet you he's the best flyer in the whole world. He's a grand-standing windbag. You can't trust him with a motorcycle, much less an airplane. The report says "only one plane slightly damaged." Every time they cross the channel, it's the same old story. Here's the squadron. I got a chance to get a little sleep- but no. Sandidge and Yackey are up there somewhere playing tag. And to think I once turned down a chance to transfer to the quartermaster corps! Another routine complaint about him from headquarters this morning. - What did it say? - The usual. What does headquarters think these guys came over here for, a sewing circle? They're playing for keeps! Cops and robbers with rocks in the snowballs, brass knuckles and lead pipes and a roughneck conviction that can lick any man in the world. So headquarters in London complains... so what? Look, look, here comes one on fire! I think they're coming in now. Those undisciplined hooligans. If they've ruined another ship, I'll kill 'em! Every time they go up, there's nothing but trouble, trouble, trouble! You'd think b-25s grew on trees! Look at that ship! A 3-alarm fire! It's going to make a crash landing! - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Any bloody noses down there? We're all right, skipper. You all right? We're o.K., sir. That was one swell landing. - Good shooting. - Thank you, sir. - You o.K., Pete? - Sure, I'm o.K. Gimme a cigarette. You know, you just did make it, pal. Thanks for herding me in. Boy, boy, I never seen so much black in one place in my life, did you- - good morning. - Morning, sir. Mission completed, sir. All planes safe. Yes. Yes, thanks. Boy, you set this crate down like a ladybug on a toadstool. I thought for a minute you was going to have to bail out, Pete. Can't afford to lose a plane in good shape like that. Make a report to intelligence. Pick me up in about an hour. Sandy? Yes, sir. Looking over your ship, I - yes, sir. I was gonna make the report. I got a date. See you later. - I'll make the report, sir. - Mind if I walk with you? No, sir. Lucky the other man got off so easily, isn't it? You know I always bring 'em back. Just a day for a little bad luck, that's all. And yesterday was your day, too, and the flight before that. Yeah. Been havin' a lot of luck, haven't I? What a beautiful day. Look at that sun. Makes a guy feel good. How high were you when you went in for your bombing run? Now, look, Nails, Al is making out a report. I got a date, and she's gonna get mad if I'm late. I gotta shave and wash and everything. Why don't you wait for the pilot's report? O.K. Tell Dorinda for me she's lucky you got back at all. What are you trying to do, break up my romance? Just trying to keep you alive. Leave that to me, Nails. I'll be seeing ya. Yeah. Soon. There he is! You call him. No. I did it yesterday. Just holler, "hey, Joe" like the Americans do. But his name isn't Joe. Don't you know anything about slang? In the American Air Forces, anybody who's a right chap is a... a guy named Joe. That's very foolish, Peter. I'll call him. No, Elizabeth. I will. - Pete! - Yeah. We're very glad you got back safe. Could you settle an argument for us? Could you, please? Yeah, sure. I guess that could be arranged. Well, now, what's the beef this morning? Well, cyril says the spitfire's a better plane than the American p-38, and I say the p-38's better. I didn't say it was all the way better. I just said it was mostly better. We shouldn't have any trouble about that. The p-38 is a little faster, and the spitfire is a little more maneuverable. They're both good planes. You see? I told him, talking all the time about the spitfire being better was bad for British and American relations. Well, I've got an uncle in America. That's more than you have. Everybody has an uncle in America. Pete, what would happen if you went way, way up high and forgot to turn your oxygen tank on? Well, you'd get weak. You'd get dizzy, and short of wind. You wouldn't be able to think properly. You couldn't coordinate. I mean, you might tell yourself to do one thing, and you'd find yourself doing something else. Gosh! Pete, tell us how it feels to be up alone in a plane all by yourself. Again? Please. Do tell us, Pete. We're nuts to hear you tell it. All right. Well, when you're up there all alone in your ship, you... Say... You kids don't ever mention any of this stuff I tell ya, do ya? No! Never. Well, don't. We won't. Well, when you're up there, you're-you're all alone. It's just you and your ship and the sky. And you don't want anybody up there with you. You don't want anybody to spoil it. Everything's kinda still. You have the feeling that you're halfway to heaven. You don't even seem to hear the sound of your own motor, just a kind of a buzz, like the sky was calling you... Like the sky was singing you a song. Gosh. Yeah. And somehow it's never 8:00 up there. It's... it's always now. And the earth is so far below you that it just doesn't matter anymore. The sky is the thing that's important. The sky is your pal. You feel like nudging it and saying, "hi, sky. How are you today?" And how's the old moon the last time you saw him? The wind drift comes straight off the morning star, and beautiful white clouds drift towards you. And they're like old friends, friends you never want to say good-bye to. And you see a patch of clear area between 'em, and you duck in and out like a porpoise rolling in the ocean. And then you say to yourself, "boy, boy", "this is the only time a man is really ever alive, the only time he's really ever free." The old sky smiles back at ya and says, "boy, you're right. You're dead right." What happens when your motor conks out? Elizabeth, Elizabeth, how did you ever get into this gang? Hey, Pete, come on, will ya? Where've you been? I've been waiting for ya. You kids run along. Can we come by and see you tomorrow, Pete? Yeah, but not a word about this to anybody. This is just between us now, us pilots. Gosh! Well, that Dorinda is certainly crazy about me. She's an hour late already. Our first day off in 3 weeks. Maybe she figures it'd do you good to be held up once in a while. It kinda keeps a fella's interest alive. One of these days I'll put that dame across my knee- you're not even listening to me. That gal's flown stuff all over these here British isles. Bet she could teach you a thing or two about a ship. Then she's late on purpose. That's worse. What does she think I am? I reckon she's got a pretty good idea. What's the matter? You oughta be feeling good. Why? Foolin' Nails. We talked ourselves outta that one slick as anything I ever did see. He didn't have a thing to say. Are you kidding? That's just what I'm worried about. That's why I wish she'd show up so we could get outta here! Gimme a cigarette. Why don't you ever buy a package of cigarettes? Hey, I hear a puddle jumper now. Yeah, that's her, all right. Yeah... yeah. Nobody else in the world would try a landing like that! I can't watch this. Let me know if she makes it. I've branded steer calves that make less fuss than you when that gal's in the air. Look at her. Pretty a landin' as you ever did see. - Are you kidding? - No, look! How many times do I have to tell ya to quit slipping this maytag messerschmitt when you're in a turn? Now you know when I saw you down here I had to kill that altitude. You killed more than the altitude. You don't even know how to level off! Is that so? Well, I always manage to come in on 3 wheels. So does a tricycle. - And another thing. - Another thing. What? How'd you get your face so dirty? I waited around for an hour. No other guy would wait an hour... Grumble, grumble. To watch a girl make a bad landing. - Now, darling- - don't darling me! You oughta be grounded. One of these days, you're gonna spin in and break that scrawny little neck. - Not scrawny! - It's a Turkey neck. A Turkey neck. Who's talking? Why, Pete! You were worried! Did you ever stop to think what one of those crates cost? Hah! That's a cover-up. You love me. I love airplanes. That's the same thing. Hello, Al! Say, you pretty near scared our hot pilot here to death comin' in like that. Well, he's probably got a crush. They get over it, though. Least all mine do. Get in before I do break your neck. Pete. Sorry. Nails wants to see you. Aw, now, cliff, be a good fellow. When you got here, we were gone. It's a kind of mystery. Yeah, but a mystery where the detective is always the fall guy. Besides, I said I was sorry. See, this wouldn't have happened if you'd been on time. Come on, come on. If you hadn't pulled some fool stunt, he wouldn't be out here hunting for you! What have you done now? Nothing. You know they can't run this show without me, honey. You get all dressed up and be at the inn for dinner at 8:00. It's possible I won't be there. If you're not, I'll have somebody else... better-lookin', too. You do and I'll scratch your eyes out. You sent for me, colonel? Yes. Yes... let's see, what- sit down, major. Thank you, sir. I know what it is. I got a problem here you can help me solve. Is that so, sir? Yes. Knowing how interested you are in photography. You must be thinking of someone else, colonel. I'm not interested in photography, especially on my day off. This won't take very long. I happened to run across photographs of the raid this morning. Very, very interesting. Here. Have a look. Yes, sir. Do you, see it, major? How high, or rather, how low would you say that plane was flying? I wouldn't know that, colonel. My guess would be about a thousand feet. That's exactly what I would say, major! Exactly! A thousand feet. Captain Yackey's report said the squadron bombed at, 12,000 feet. I was just wondering whose plane could have come in at a thousand? And another thing... Have you any idea what that is, major? No, colonel, I haven't the faintest idea. That is an engine whistle- you know, off a locomotive- toot toot. It was blown right through the fuselage of your ship. Amazing, isn't it, major? Would you like me to say of course! Of course I would, major! You know, after all these years of being buddies, why should we suddenly allow rank to come between us and the truth? Speak up, Pete! You said to take care of the roundhouse, didn't ya? Well, the squadron missed it, so I went in and took it out! I've been under the impression this is a war we're fighting! Of course, I could be wrong- don't get excited. Of course we're fighting a war. But you seem to want to end it in the next 3 days, alone! Come on, Nails, let's get this over with! All right! When you're with your squadron, you lead the squadron, not lone wolf it. You control a lot of lives and planes. I expect you to stay where you belong! You said to take out the roundhouse! You can't take out the roundhouse at 12,000 feet! Then make a report, and we'll put it on special assignment! When a tough job comes up, I won't make a report! And I won't assign it to somebody else - I'll do it myself! So long as I'm in command, I don't want any squadron commander playing hide 'n' seek among the chimney stacks! - Are you trying to be a hero?! - Aw, wait a minute, Nails! Where were you when you got that dfc, playing mumblety-peg? O.K., o.K.! You didn't catch up to your squadron for- well... I suppose you've got me right where you want me, haven't you? Well, you know, Nails, the guy in the air has always got it on the man on the ground a little. I suppose it'll always be that way. Make me a promise, will ya, Pete? Sure. Promise me you'll be a little more careful. Sure, Nails, I promise. And look, I'm sorry I took up your time. That's all right, Nails. - Have a nice time this afternoon. - Thank you. Thank you. And Pete... No hard feelings. No, no, colonel. You know better than that. Atta boy. Get me headquarters in London. I want to talk to general Sloan. Yes, sir. And, ask miss Dorinda Durston of the ferrying command if she'll stop in and see me. Yes, sir. She's got a funny look in her off eye, Pete. Hello, Dorinda. Hello, honey. We've been waiting dinner on you. I hope you two have been having fun. Will you have a little snort? No, I don't feel like drinking this evening. A lot of people criticize a lot of other people for doing a lot of things a lot of other people do which aren't nearly as bad as the things a lot of people are doing themselves. You stay right where you are, Al Yackey. Don't think you can crawl out of this. Why don't you wipe that smiling killer look on your face and tell us what's the matter? All right. When are you going to stop being a dime-store hero? You got me! This is for you. Never mind that. Answer me. Well, I'd like to, but you don't make any sense. Well, let me tell you something. I saw the pictures of your plane flying low enough to scrape paint off the rooftops. Nails showed them to me. What's more, I saw the plane- them pictures- you keep out of this! What are you yelling at him for? Shut up! You're such a low-down, no-good heel, any woman... Look, darling, this is a little gift for you. I'm very fond of you, honey, but take this or I'll wrap it around your neck! Don't talk to me like that! Who do you think you are? If you want to risk your darn fool neck, go ahead. I can get along. Only don't sit there like a drooling farm boy with a package- drooling? I'm not drooling. You're drooling and you're trying to buy yourself off with a present. You can take this, whatever it is, and throw it in the garbage! In the garbage? This? In the garbage it goes. Of all the trouble-making, back-stabbing, poison-shooting dames I ever saw! Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag. Yeah. Pete! Girl clothes! From London. Yeah. I've never seen ya in a real dress, remember? Then you didn't get it just to make up for what happened this morning. - You didn't have time. - That's right. Why didn't you tell me before I lost my temper? You didn't give me a chance. But, Pete, you're such a fool, and you've no right to be. But you're kinda sweet. Go on upstairs and put that thing on, see if I recognize you. If you don't, you big lug, you'll break my heart! - Lot of woman, Pete. - Lot of woman. Could be. 2 with soda. Bad luck. Make it 3. One with poison. I thought I'd find you hot pilots here. We've been pining away for you, Nails. Will you have a drink, colonel? I mean lieutenant-colonel? Yes, thanks. That was a very funny trick you pulled on me this afternoon. Let's have a drink on that. Good. What trick was that? Showing Dorinda those pictures. You almost got me in a lot of trouble. That wasn't a trick. I was simply trying to prove to her what a solid 14-carat hero you are. We're even now, Nails? I guess so. Incidentally, Pete, I don't believe you realize, but headquarters is pretty impressed with your record. They feel you're wasting your talents as a squadron commander. They want you to be a group commander. No, Nails! That's great! You'd be a lieutenant-colonel at least! Maybe a full colonel. A couple of chickens wouldn't look bad? More dough, too. Course, I'd hate to rank you, Nails. Ho ho ho! They're shoving the active fliers ahead pretty fast these days. I'm afraid there wouldn't be any advance in rank at first. Not until we see how you work out. Purely routine, of course. Yeah, sure. At least I won't be pestered with you for a while, so let's drink to that. Good idea. May be your last before you go. Before I go where? Scotland. Scotland? That's reconnaissance. You can't do that to me, Nails. Reconnaissance is important. There's nothing to do there. It's like being retired. There is an element of rest in it. You've been trying to do this to me for a long time. You won't get away with it. I'll go over your head to general Sloan. This is funny. Because here's an order signed by general Sloan that says you are going to Scotland. Nails, you can't do this to Pete. We've been flying together ever since- isn't this touching? And really in the best tradition of the air force. Just so you don't feel you've been forgotten, Al, the general doesn't want any broken hearts in the outfit. Air transport'll have a ship waiting at 5 a.m. O.K. We'll be there. That's awfully good of you, major. Good night. And thanks for the drink. He won't get away with this. Sometimes I wonder who he's fighting, us or the Nazis. He's just like all the rest of these armchair pilots. He hasn't flown anything faster than a bathtub for 30 years. He's afraid to walk upstairs without a parachute strapped to his back. Well, I'm going to beat this rap. I'll beat it if I have to go to the- say... look at that! That's o.K. You like it? Dorinda, you're as pretty as a pair of yellow shoes. Thanks, Al. And you, Pete, my boy? Gosh. Have a drink. I want to dance. Come on. Let's dance. It's a lovely dress, Pete. Yeah, it's pretty. Makes me realize you're a girl instead of a sky-flying cowboy. I feel like a girl, too. I feel like my 16th birthday and the time I graduated from high school and the first time I flew solo all wrapped up in one. Do you? That's a pretty large order. Yeah. How do you feel? I feel fine. Did you pick out this dress all by yourself? What? Me pick out a dress? Are you crazy? Did they model it for you? The girls? No! I wish I'd been there. - Why, what's so funny about it? - Nothing, I suppose. Pete. How'd you know what size shoes to get? Do you want to dance or talk? I wanna bite your ear. Let me bite your ear. Stop that. People are looking. Let's just dance. Come on. You know that guy? Pete, old man, I never saw him before in my life. Did you smile at him? - I think I did. - Yes. Yes, I did. Why? Because I'm so happy. That was a pretty stupid thing to do. Why, Pete, you're jealous. I am not jealous. Don't want you giving the guy the wrong impression. Pete. Did I ever give you the wrong impression? Why? Well... don't watch me blush, but... I tried to once or twice. Say, look... Do you feel all right? You haven't got spots in front of your eyes? No, no, no. No, I feel wonderful. I feel marvelous. Mighty fancy. Mighty fancy. Brother, you ain't seen nothin'. Sing it again. Pete... Let's dance all night through, shall we? I've never done it. I read about it once. It sounded wonderful. No go. Why not? Al and I are shoving off at 5 a.m. What do you mean, shoving off? For where? For Scotland. Scotland? Yeah. Nails assigned us to Scotland. - But he promised he wouldn't! - He what? Well, he told me he was thinking about sending you up there, and I said that 10 days' leave would do the job better, and we argued, then finally he said o.K. He promised me! You been sticking up for me? I always stick up for you. - Pretty crazy for me, aren't ya? - Don't fool, Pete! - How long are you gonna be gone? - Not as long as Nails thinks. Pete. You realize something? What? You realize that you and I have never been up in a plane together? Alone, I mean? Yeah. I realize that. Why don't you take me up with you tonight? Kind of a good-bye flight. It'll be fun. - Yeah. It'd be fun, wouldn't it. - Yeah. You know, you're a sweet girl, but when I fly for fun, I like to fly alone. That's not fair. It's just the way I feel. Please, Pete, please. The minute you got out of that uniform, you sure became a woman. Please, please! You're taking awful advantage of a pretty dress. But I've never flown with you, Pete. Dorinda, cut it out. You're dancing too close. Give up? Do we fly? Do we? I'll tell you what I'll do with you. You know how I feel about women in the air, don't ya? Promise me you'll get a desk job, and I'll take you up. Wrong gal, Pete. Wrong place. Wrong time, too. Pete. Why don't you be a good guy and marry me? Why don't you run upstairs and skin outta that graduation number? - Al and I are leaving in a minute. - O.K. Give me a kiss. I wonder what kind of kids we'd have. Are you crazy? Cute, I'll bet. Not a brain in their heads, of course, but they'd have fun. What a fog. Plane's been buzzing around overhead for the last half hour. Must be like trying to find your way through the inside of a cow. I never did see such a country! Even the birds are walkin'. Routine search area "a"- Fog. Does anything ever happen up here? Jack says he hit a seagull about 14 miles north of here this morning. Tell him if he can hit a pelican, I'll put him in for the congressional medal of honor. Did I tell you what that kid of mine hit? No, what did he hit? I just got a letter from my wife. The kid was hunting rabbits one morning for about an hour. Back he come running yelling for her to come out and see what he's killed. So she went out. Know what it was? A cow. Deader than $700. How's that for a kid 8 years old? A full-grown cow! Sometimes I think you're daffy! You do? Well, everybody's entitled to their own opinion, Pete. You know what I think of you, don't ya? I think you're gettin' kinda edgy. Nothing the matter with me that a few drinks won't cure. What a way to win a war. I reckon maybe you're missing Dorinda little bit? You reckon, do you? Me, too. Just don't seem like we can hardly get along without her, does it? I never been so lonesome for another guy's gal in all my days. Where do you figure she is now, Pete? How do I know? Probably listening to some tall talk from that jukebox commando. I suppose you think she's doing that. Maybe. You can talk mighty foolish sometimes, Pete. Why shouldn't she? There's no law against it. She's not married to me or anybody else. You know, Pete, back where I come from, folks call that love stuff quick poison or slow poison. If it's quick poison, it hurts you all over real bad like a shock of electricity. But if it's slow poison, it's like a fever that aches in your bones for a thousand years. Slow poison love's what you and Dorinda got.. Yep, that's what you got, little case of slow poison. Hey, that guy must have found a hole in the sky. Transport. Hi, cowboy. Hiya. Say, you guys really put on fog up here. Yeah! Guy around name of Sandidge? That's me. I have a package for you, sir. Package? Dorinda! Well, hamstring me for an old steer! How are you, honey? Hello, Al. Surprised? You bet I'm surprised. You look shiny as a new propeller! Shut 'em off. We'll give you a toddy. No, thanks. I've got my clearance, and I'm an hour late. - Good luck. - Thanks a million, ray! I've got the most wonderful news in the world. Only first, give me another kiss, you big moose, a real one. You know, Al, I think she's really glad to see us. Maybe it's a good idea we came up here? She appreciates us. Could be. Pete. Is that your plane? The b-25 over there that looks like a ghost? Sure it's my plane. Why? Nothing. Nothing. - What do you mean? - Let's get out of this soup. How long you gonna hang around here? 24 hours. Correction, 22. What's all this big news you're bustin' with, honey? Something you lugs are going to jump at. Yeah. And I know what it is, too. You do? What? Nails has finally decided if he's gonna win this war, he needs a little less reconnaissance and more fighting. Now, it's much better than that. Nails is going back to the states, and most of the old gang with him. Seems they need instructors back there who've had combat service, and Nails says you two can come along if you want to. Do we have to go? No, it's purely voluntary, but Nails wants you to. Now isn't that sweet of him? So he sent you to try to talk us into it? If you want to put it that way, yes. You think I'm gonna go back and start teaching a lot of kids to fly? That's all right for a lot of guys, including Nails, but not for me. Sit around in some officer's club in Kansas City? I'd go crazy! Besides, I hate kids. But you're liable to be up here for the duration! No, no. They'll get in trouble soon then send for us. You haven't got good sense, either of you. You've got a chance to go home and do a real job. But no, you'll stick around here till you're both knocked off. We could crawl under the bed for the duration, too. There's the Jeep. I'll get it and take you over to the inn. Hey, sergeant! Sergeant! What are you all steamed up about, Dorinda? I've got to get him out of here, Al. Out of here? Yeah. What for? Because his number's up. I could tell it the minute I saw that plane. Aw, his number ain't gonna be up for a good, long time, honey. He'll probably slip in a bathtub and break his neck when he's 80 or so. He's a lucky guy. You know that. I tell you, I felt it. You remember just before Joe Bailey went down. You could tell it the minute you looked at him. You told me so yourself. That's right. And he washed out. Well, that's just the way I feel about Pete right now. Well, there don't appear to be much I can do about that, honey. Yes, there is, Al. If I can persuade him to go back to the states, will you go along? If you feel that way about it, sure. Then be ready to go in the morning. How are you gonna go about convincing him? You hungry? I'm going to- as a wolf! As a wolf? Well, then come on. See you later, Al. Yeah. Fell asleep. What did you do? I listened to you snore and looked at your legs. I don't snore, and you're a lecherous old man. That's your fault. Pete, you're pulling your eyebrows again. She loves me... She loves me not. Well, stop it. Stop it, stop it. I'm resigned to your being bald some day, but a bald man without eyebrows looks just like an egg. Don't mention eggs. Haven't seen an egg for 6 weeks. What's wrong with eggs, anyway? They have no character. Do you know something? I have no character, either. Does that surprise you? No.. But... I'll bet I can surprise you. How? I'm applying for a transfer tomorrow. - Where to? - Australia. Australia? You're crazy. No, it's true, Pete. Aw, don't be silly. Get that out of your head. Well, it's my business, isn't it? Whose is it? It's my business, and I won't let ya do it. Well, wait a minute, my buckaroo. How do you plan to stop me? Just by saying no. That sounds like an order, Pete, and I don't like orders very well. All right, then I'll ask ya. Dorinda, don't be a pig-headed fool. Sweet, sweet, irresistible Pete. Gentle, tactful, clever. Wait a minute. Don't laugh at me. I'm serious. So am I serious. Now you listen to me for a change. I'm willing to offer you a fair deal. You've always wanted to get me out of the air, haven't you? Here's your chance. You go back with Nails tomorrow morning, back to the states where they need you and want you, and I'll take ground service. Otherwise, I'm off to Australia, and it's that or nothing, Pete. It is? Well, I'm afraid then it's nothing. Quick as that. All right. Let's talk about something else. Yeah. You know you got feet like a monkey's. I bet you could pick up a dime- Pete, please, please go back! For me! Why should I? Because your number's up, and because I like you in spite of the fact you're such a lug! You know, Dorinda, the madder you get, the prettier you are. You've been a flyer long enough to know that when a guy's number is up, it's up. Wouldn't I look swell cracking up in a plane outside of dubuque? What about me? I remember a poem I learned once. I had to learn it, as a matter of fact. "Men must work and women must weep." I remember that women must weep part. So that's the way you figure it. Women must weep. What claptrap! When you crack up, I'm supposed to sit around wet-eyed like an old man with asthma and mumble prayers the rest of my life. What a surprise you're going to get. You might at least crack out with a bottle. - Do you know what I'll do? - Sure, cry like every dame. I'll not cry. I'll find myself a man with good sense. - You'll never find as good a flyer. - I won't, hey? Don't kid your what makes you think you're a flier? You belong back in 1925 in a flying circus. I can just see you now out at the fairgrounds doing loop-de-loops. You never stayed with your squadron. You're a lone wolf in a service where men fly together. You've got hero hunger, and better men than you come a dime a dozen! You'll never have as much fun with anybody. Fun! What's fun about knowing you're asking for it every time you take off? You think I like being sick inside all the time? Waiting? Being afraid when a telephone rings? Being afraid when it doesn't? Aw, now, don't talk nonsense, Dorinda. You're not going to settle down with anybody else, and you know it. What makes you think I'm not, you-you conceited ape! Because I'm going back to the states with you, with you and Nails. Pete. Yeah. You're gonna stay on the ground, and I'm gonna teach some of those supermen how to fly an airplane. Pete... you mean I win for once? You mean it? In a deal like this, you only have to win once. And I guess this is your round. Pete. Of course, you might figure that I'd won, too. Fun's over, kids. Just got a report there's a big convoy from the states about 300 miles off the coast, and they think the Nazis'll sneak a carrier out. - A carrier?! - Yep. That's what they think. We'll just have to go out and sink that carrier. Can't you send somebody else out? No, they're all on detail. Besides, I never saw a German carrier, did you? - Come on, Pete, we gotta go. - I'll be right with ya. See you later, honey. You still my girl? Most of me. Drink to it. We got a lot of things settled tonight, didn't we? Pete. We never seem to get a break, do we? What are you talkin' about? Meeting you was a break. - No, don't kiss me. - Why? I just don't want to kiss you. What's the idea? I'm afraid if I say good-bye, it might mean good-bye. A kiss can't say it. Words can't either. What are you talkin' about? I'm not gonna say good-bye to you for a thousand years. But if there were anything like good-bye, there's be a kiss to say it. You sleep here all night. I'll wake you up with a hot cup of coffee when I come back. Pete! You don't belong back in 1925 in a flying circus. You're the best cockeyed pilot that ever lived or ever will! Sure. There she is. Look at that flock of destroyers with her. We got enough bombs here to give those guys some trouble. Yeah, it'd be fun, wouldn't it? No. This is a job for headquarters to figure out. What are you trying to do, be a hero? He's waitin' for a turn! Well, how do you like that? 2 weeks ago, he'd have gone after the whole fleet. He must be gettin' some brains. Hey! No use keepin' that radio dead. Radio the carrier's position. We may have to bail out. We're bailing out, boys. Give cap the position. 02295. 5 positions. We're bailing out. Navigator, mark this position. Radio, notify base. Hurry up. When are you comin'? Right away. Go on. Get out. Get out! Well, Dorinda- don't tell me, Al. Don't tell me. I know. Maybe I better fix us up a cup of coffee? No! They picked up the other guys all right. That's good. I'm glad of that. I dunno why these things have to happen, Dorinda, but just seems like maybe there was something pushing him on and on and on. I know. His number was up. I knew it all along. Yep. I told him when he cracked up, I wasn't going to cry. Not one tear. And I haven't. Well, I dunno, honey, it just don't seem right hardly to cry about Pete. He was a flier, and the way I figure it, fliers may crack up once in a while, sure, but they never really die. That's not true, Al. That's not true. Because... I just have. Hey! Hey! Dick Brumley! Hiya, Pete! Well, it's Pete himself! Yeah! Hey, you had yourself quite a little show with that carrier, didn't you? Sure, sure. You know me. Come right out of a cloud, and there she was. 4 destroyers right around her. Doing about 22 knots. We didn't want to radio our position, so we headed for home. Boy, then it happened! Her fighter escort swarmed all over us. Al was about 6 miles away- so, he wasn't very much help, and... Say, there's something cockeyed here. What? You don't belong here. Well, I certainly don't belong anywhere else. You're Dick Brumley, aren't ya? Yes. I saw you shot down. Your plane was on fire. - Nobody coulda got out of it. - That's right. But you got out of it. No, I rode her down, Pete. Wait a minute. Take it easy. Either I'm dead or I'm crazy. Well, you're not crazy, Pete. You mean, I'm dead? Yeah! I'm... You mean... - You mean this is for good? - You guessed it. You mean I went out and let them knock me over? - That's about it. - And now I'm... You-you mean I'm dead? Yep. You mean... dead. - How do ya like that? - I don't mind it at all. I don't feel any different. It's pretty much the same once you get the hang of it. This is great. I never played a harp in my life. There's not much time for harp playing up here. There's plenty of work to do and good men to do it. Come on, let's get moving. I want you to meet the boss. - You got a commanding officer up here? - Yeah, and a good one. Well, let's make it short and sweet. Hey. What's wrong? That Dorinda girl. She sure called the turn on this one. Well, that happens, too. How is Dorinda? She's fine. - Poor kid. - Why? This is certainly gonna be tough on her. For a while, but she'll get over it. What do you mean, she'll get over it? The girl is crazy about me. She was, but good-looking girl like Dorinda doesn't have any trouble making new friends. I don't mind if she has a couple of friends. That's very generous of you. I think she should have a good time. You know, nothing serious, but I think she oughta have some fun once in a while. She will. Is he our commanding officer? Sure. One of the greatest flyers that ever lived. Sure. We got 'em all up here. These guys know I'm up here? They will. What a flyer he was. Too bad he never had a chance to fly any of the modern stuff. I'd like to give him a ride in some of the real hot stuff. You may go in now, sir. Sir, this is major Peter Sandidge of the United States army air force. At ease. - Glad to know you, Sandidge. - Thank you, sir. We've been expecting you here for some time. Thank you, sir. Is that so, sir? Yeah. I've been studying your record. It isn't much. Well, I agree with you about that. You can fly fairly well if you obey orders. "Fairly well"? I do things with a plane the designer didn't even think of. That's just the point, Sandidge. We work here on the general lines of trying to do things with the plane the designer did think of. Well, I can do that, too, sir. I hope so. You know our work here, of course. No, sir. I don't think so. It's pretty simple. We operate on the principle of helping the other fella. If a flyer down below needs a little assistance, we assign a man to ride with him. I see. Sure. Well, it's not much like the old days. I'll never forget the day I soloed. 30-mile cross wind blowing. Motor wouldn't turn up. I was just taking her off- you're not under the impression that you learned to fly all by yourself, are you? Well, if I didn't, sir, I'd like to know who helped me. Well, I guess I can tell you that. You were helped by every man since the beginning of time who dreamt of wearing wings, by pioneers who flew pieces of wire and paste board long before you were born, by every pilot that ever crashed into the ground in order that others could stay up in the sky. I see, sir. Now it's your turn to pass that along to the next man. Yes, sir. That'll be all for now. Brumley will break you in and stay with you for a while. I think you'll like it after you get the hang of it. Yes, sir. Well, good luck boys, and do a good job. Thank you, sir. Don't they ever salute in these parts? Not if they don't see you, they don't. - Can't hear us either? - No. I got a hunch you and I are going to get awful sick of our conversations. Not if we keep busy. Kind of makes you feel like nothing. It's going to take a little time to get used to this. Hey, buddy. You realize there are a lot of things going on around you that you don't know anything about? You're a pretty silly-looking guy, you know that? And don't answer me back, neither one of ya. This thing has its points, at that. I just hope I run across Nails Kilpatrick once before I die. Well, I hope I run across him. What's the layout here? Well, these boys have had their 9-weeks' ground work, their 9-weeks' primary training. They're starting basic training now so you can figure out they're a pretty nervous bunch of kids. We get the problem children of the outfit? Something like that. How do we know which one of these new-fangled flyers we're gonna work on? You'll see. You wanted me, sir? You realize you cleared that water tower by less than 6 feet? I was trying to see how accurately I could judge my distance. Well, isn't that fine. Well, when I want a fool maneuver like that I'll ask for it, understand? Very well, sir. I was just remembering that major Sandidge sank a German flattop with a maneuver like that. Now, there's a great little kid and a great little flyer. That will quite possibly go down as the luckiest incident in the history of world war ii. Lucky? Listen to that guy. He reminds me of Nails. But he did sink the carrier, colonel, and they gave him a d.S.C. You hear that? I got a d.S.C. Unfortunately, it came too late for him to wear. We're not training you men to die. We're training you to live. The first budding hero I catch among you will be washed out. I don't like that guy's attitude. - Randall? - Yes, sir? You and Rourke seem to be having a little trouble. Take your ships up, and maybe I can find out what's the matter. Yes, sir. That's all, boys. Come on. Let's take a look at those 2 flyers. I don't think I'm gonna be very happy here. Strange feeling that's my man. Boy, you got trouble. That's what I'm here for. What's he waiting for? Give her the gun. More, you dope. No, no. How can a guy do that to an airplane? Why don't he get it off the ground? What's he afraid of? That's your problem, not mine. What do you mean by that crack? You picked him up. He's your baby. If I ever learn to keep my mouth shut... Have you forgotten when you were having your first trouble with a plane? Say, listen- the point is, from here on out the only way you can fly a plane is through that man or somebody else like him. From the take-off I just saw, there is nobody else like him. Look at him now. What kind of a guy is he? Is he an idiot? Aw, he's a nice guy. So's mine. Yours got his m.A. From Boston tech in combustion engines, and mine's an all-American guard from usc. You mean to tell me a guy can learn all about engines and do what he's doing to one of 'em right now? He knows what makes 'em tick. He can't make 'em fly. He's nervous. Might be the result of inheriting $4 million. $4 million? You know what I'd do with all that dough if I was him? I'd spend it all on life insurance. I can't watch this. Come on. So, this is where they sleep? Where do we sleep? On the floor. That's cozy. One thing about our branch of the service, we'll never go soft from good living, will we? Well, here's your man. Get a load of that. Look at him-all spread out on that nice soft bed. How can you sleep like that after what you did today? There's money bags. He's not asleep yet. Why don't you close those big blue eyes? What's the matter with ya? Are you a worrier? How do you like this guy? 4 million bucks, and he's got insomnia. What'll I do, let him roll and toss like this, or shall I rock him to sleep? Leave him alone. He's the thoughtful type. What are you thinking about? It can't be financial worries. What's the matter with you? Why don't you go to sleep? Look at that guy. Look at that kisser. 4 million bucks. Come to think of it, I never did see a guy that inherited a lot of dough that was any good. Good night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams to you. I might as well tip you off to this- I don't think I'm gonna like ya. Like him or not, you start flying with him tomorrow morning. Come on. You scared? If he's not, I am. Scared? What do you think I'm humming for? This colonel Sykes is one tough baby. Good luck. Looks like today or never. You're first. So long! Well, here we go, against my better judgment. You can't see me or hear me, but they tell me I can get through to ya. Personally, I doubt it. No, no, no. Don't hug the ground. Give her the gun. Relax, you got nothing to worry about. Remember, with all that cash you got a lot to live for. Just sit back and let the ship fly herself. Remember, this airplane knows more about flying than you'll ever know. I said relax. I'm too stiff. I gotta take it easy. Now, listen, buddy. There's a few corny ideas you gotta get out of your head if you're gonna fly an airplane. Most things are just the reverse of what people think. The higher you are, the safer you are. The earth down there, that's your enemy. Once you hit that boy, you splatter. Now, take it easy. Relax. Enjoy it. Get a kick out of it. There. That's pretty good. That's better. Take a look around. Kinda pretty up here, isn't it? Pretty nice. Take your turn in traffic, Randall. Hold your proper altitude. All right, come on. Let's ease her down. Don't stiffen. Don't stiffen. Down we go. Down... Down, down, down. Take it easy, now. Remember, you're a soap bubble. You're a feather. Easy... Easy, easy, easy... That was fine. And how you ever got by primary training I'll never know! They must be hard up for pilots. Just think-all that dough and you're gonna be a flyer to boot. But don't ever forget that I'm the guy that did it. That was swell work, Ted. Really great. Boy, I almost grounded. Every time I hit the dirt, I think the show's over. Yeah, that's usually my trouble. But today I seem to get the hang of it. Hey, it looks like you got a flyer on your hands. Yeah. Not bad? Yeah, you're pretty proud of yourself. It's kind of fun punching some brains in that guy's head. When does your guy go up? Right away. He does? Say, did you tell me he was a football player? - Yeah, that's right. - I could do a lot with him. Well, take him. You don't mind? No. That's what we're here for. - See what you can do with him. - Thanks. My mama done told me when I was in knee pants... Cut that out. My mama done told me when I was in knee pants son that's better. In the first place, your mammy didn't told you enough. In the second place, from now on, I'm telling you. Now listen, you big ape. Give her the gun, and execute a forward pass over that first line of trees. Come on, now. Let's see you do it. You don't want it that way? Change signals then. Make it a punt, make it a drop kick. Make it anything, but get this baby into the air! Get it over the trees! Get it into the air! You must have been a sensation on the football field. Make your turn in traffic, Rourke. That's better, Rourke. There, you hear that? The coach likes you. He thinks you're good. Now, here's the way to figure this thing. When you were playing guard, the quarterback was doing all the thinking, and he was getting all the credit. Now all that's changed. On our team, you're the quarterback. You do the thinking. You're the whole show. Just think of those headlines, boy. Think of those headlines. All right, Rourke. Into the traffic pattern for a landing. Keep an eye open for other planes. Our side's gonna attempt a drop kick, and remember, you're holding the ball. And you're holding it with your fingertips. You get that? Now, take it easy. Easy! Don't fumble now, you big ox. Remember, there's 60,000 fans in those stands watching. Easy now! Set her down like that. Easy on the controls- with your fingertips. Your fingertips! Right between the goal posts! What a pouf! Yeah, what a pouf. Good comeback. Yeah, I've seen it happen before. A man who seemed hopeless suddenly gets the hang of things. He may not be as good as this tomorrow, but he'll never again be as bad as that first run. He's-he's feeling it. I'm a ding-dog daddy from dumas and you wanna see me do my stuff that was great, powerhouse. There's nothing to it. - You know what I figured out? - What? I'm a lot better when I'm up there alone than when I've got one of these instructors riding with me. How do you like that guy? You know what I found out? This is a cinch. It's just like football. Football?! Yeah. Reminded me of the day we beat Pittsburgh. We pulled a fake reverse. I cut over center, and I opened up this hole as wide as the second front, but the dumb quarterback dropped the ball. So as quick as a flash, I picked it up, and the rest is history. 72 yards for a touchdown. I heard it over the radio. Everybody heard it over the radio! Now look at that. All this life going on around him, and he sits there reading a book. I have 2 tickets to the majestic theater tonight. Would you like them? No. Hey. You know, you've got the rest of your life to read that book. Why don't you step out there and ask one of those dolls to dance? Or does a guy with your kind of dough only dance with society dames? Look at that girl over there. Look at her, you dope. She's a honey. She's a dish. Maybe you'd like to dance? No. That girl is lonesome. Why don't you go over there and tackle her? Tell you're lonesome. Tell her you want to dance. Tell her she reminds you of your sister. Tell her anything. Why don't you try spending a couple of bucks? You can't tell, you might like it. Wouldn't you like a sandwich or a candy bar or something? No. I... good evening. Hello. I... I came over because... Because she reminds you of your sister. Well, you remind me a great deal of my sister. How nice. Would you like to dance? Thank you very much. My name is Ellen bright. What's yours? Randall, Ted Randall, and I'm delighted to know you. That's more than I can say for that boy at the counter. What's the matter with him? Homesickness. Just comes in and stares like that every night. I guess homesickness can be pretty bad. Yeah, I imagine it can. I remember my first year at college. I used to get so lonesome for somebody from home, I could almost cry. Guess that's the way he feels right now. You know who he is or where he comes from? You can't help knowing. He talks about it all the time. His name is Sanderson. He comes from a little town called twin hooks, Rhode Island. And from what he says, twin hooks, Rhode Island is just about 5 times as beautiful as paradise. Would you mind waiting for me for a minute? No, of course not. I'll be right back. Well, I got him off to a good start. You did? And after we'd won the game, we'd all sit around the dressing room where we'd sing the old fight song. You'll love this. It went like this. Fight on for old u.S.C. Come and fight on to victory telephone call for Sanderson. Sanderson? For who? Telephone call for Sanderson. Is that you? Must be some other Sanderson. Come on. Nobody'd be calling me. Hello? Who? I don't under... Mom! It's my mom! That was swell of you. You know, that's a funny thing. He's a nice guy. Knows how to spend his money too. All I know is what people around town said. When Hank was a boy, you know, no bigger than this, he worked at the sawmill down by the river. And one day, he fell into the saw and cut off his big toe. That's terrible. Not for Hank. His folks didn't even call in a doctor. And afterwards, when people asked about the accident, Hank said it didn't bother him a bit, that he'd just grow a new toe. Are you kidding? This guy's a bigger liar than I was. The only difference is, he gets away with it. Well, why can't you and Ted come over to the house tomorrow night? Because we're on 24 hours notice. That means that by tomorrow night at this time, we may be a long way from San Francisco. We don't know where we're going... What do you mean, "bring Ted over," anyhow? He's cute. How long have you known him? - Who? - Ted. We've been buddies for over a year now. Same class. We got our wings together. Go on with the story. Well, about a year before I left home, Hank was working at the same sawmill, and he fell into the same saw. Only this time it cut off his foot, about up to here. I don't believe it. He was growing himself a new foot. What happened? Well, some folks said that first there'd be a full-grown foot. Then the rest of the leg would grow till the foot touched the ground. Others said that they'd grow the leg out first, and then the heel with the toenails last of all. And then there were those who said that there'd be a tiny little foot and ankle, and then it would grow till it got to be full sized. Don't you think that's a very interesting scientific problem? I think it's just fascinating. It's just the most wonderful thing I've ever heard of. There's a dame that's headed for the booby hatch. Finally they decided it's downright immoral for a guy to grow a foot without them knowing anything about it. So they go up to Hank's house. And they yell up that if Hank doesn't let them in, they're gonna set fire to the place. Well, Hank lets go from his bedroom window with a double-barreled shotgun. So they set fire to the back porch. Well, the place got hotter and hotter. Thank you. Wait a minute. Let me look at you. This is really amazing. You know, you remind me of my sister? We're all brothers and sisters, aren't we? First time in 6 months that line hasn't worked. O.K. Thanks. Well, this is it. I'm sorry, girls. If you're still hungry, you'll have to finish alone. But why? What's happening? - But Ted, what about the fire? - I'll tell you on the way out. You know, that thing about the foot- if that's a line, it's no good. And if he believes it himself, he's crazy. Guy couldn't grow another foot, could he? You got me, pal. Here, take these girls wherever they want to go. But what about Hank? Hank? Hank. Well, the place burned down. But what happened to Hank? Well, nobody knows. Did he get out of the house or didn't he? - He never got out. - What about the foot, you dope? Did he grow a new foot? They never found out. All they found was a little bridgework. Gold, you know. Nothing else. Nothing at all. Well, I didn't say it was a funny story. It smells. Well, I guess this is good-bye. Well, so long, Greg. I wonder if this is that wartime immorality they're always talking about. 'Bye, Ted. Who do we take out next? Nobody. We're gonna ride along with them. - With them? - Those guys can fly. That's only half the job. We gotta see how they hold up in combat. Do I have to keep on looking at that guy? You can't give us a hint of where we're going, can you? Well, I can tell you that where you're going I don't think you'll find anybody who reminds you of your sister. You got all that consignment of spare parts aboard, sergeant? Yes, sir. 23 cases. Good. Take her up. We made it. I sure hope that new outfit coming in brings plenty of spare parts with them. Yeah. What's the matter? Blown out. Blown out? Reminds me of the last letter I got from my wife. You know what that kid of mine did? No, sir. Well, he's trying to be a chemist, and he's out in the barn one day fooling around mixing stuff together-a little potash, a little sulfur- and maybe a little Nitroglycerin. You know what happened? No, sir. He blew the barn up- the whole cockeyed barn. Just blew it up! Ain't that the funniest thing you ever heard? Yes, sir. That sure is funny, colonel. You know, that reminds me of my kid. He's only 4- aw, you wait till he's 9, Henderson. Then's when they're really fun. Yes, sir, but as I as saying- aw, great things, kids. Great things. Let me know when you get this tub finished, will you? Yes, sir. Al? Yes, sir. What time's that gang from the states get in? About an hour, sir. See that they're fixed up. Sure will. Old friend of yours got in from Sydney. - Yeah, who's that? - Dorinda Durston. Are you kidding? Where is she, Nails? Over in 4. Holy smoke! Give her my regards, will you? You bet I will. Hello, Dorinda. Al! Al Yackey! They told me you just pulled in, honey. It's good to see you. It's good to see you, Al. Hey, hey, hey. What's this? Just hold on. It'll leave in just a minute. Let me look at you. - Why, Al, you're a colonel! - That's right. Everybody gets promoted these days. You ought to see Nails. He's a brigadier, my boss here. Colonel Al Yackey. Aw, gee. Can you imagine how Pete'd cuss, having to salute me? Yeah. He sure would, wouldn't he? Sit down, Al. I was just starting to unpack. I did that on purpose, Dorinda. I had to find out how you were doing. Not so good, not so good. I manage to keep busy. Yeah, I know. They tell me you're trying to win this war all by yourself. Nobody ever sees you anymore. All work and no play. Makes a girl keep her mind off her troubles. You look kind of peaked too, honey. It don't seem right- Al... Please don't make me cry. You're gonna have to get over this, Dorinda. Get over it? You sound like I had the measles or something. You don't get over a thing like this. You die from it. That's not the gal I know, honey. Too many things to remember, Al. You find you've gone over all the big things a million times or more, and then you begin to think of the little things, like the time he got to talking to me and stepped off into a puddle and I laughed, and he got mad. And then we forgot all about it, until out of nowhere at all, that little stumble comes to live with me again. Remember the time in the machine shop- Yeah, I guess I know what you mean, honey. I remember he used to be always running out of cigarettes, bumming them from me, and I'd say, "Pete, why don't you buy some. I'm never gonna save a dime till I get rid of you." Well, I got rid of him, all right, and I haven't saved a dime yet. This is just plain darned foolishness, sitting around here moaning like this. Look. I'm meeting a new bunch of boys from the states tonight. Why don't you come over to the officer's club with us and break a bottle open? No, thanks, Al. I'd much rather stay here. You'd rather stay here? Yeah. And moan? Well, that's my business. That's right, sure. That's your business, all right. But if you're gonna sit and grieve all the rest of your life, why don't you do it right? Why don't you get a room and lock yourself up in it, and wear black silk dresses? And put a little white handkerchief over your head and a pasty look on your face? I knew a woman back home did that. She got just what she wanted, too. Folks felt sorry for her for 30 years. That's not nice, Al. All right, so it ain't nice. But it's the truth. You think you're the only guy that ever got a kick in the teeth? You're not. It's happening every day, and it's gonna keep right on happening till this thing's over. You can feel sorry for yourself, or you can come out with me and see how nice people are when they're alive. Al, I like you better than anybody on earth, I guess, and I know you're trying to help me, but this is just something I've got to work out in my own way. Look, honey. You see this guy? That's Pete Sandidge, the best friend I ever had or ever will. He's the greatest guy in the world, and I miss him more than anybody ever missed a guy before. But he's dead, and I'm alive. I'm gonna put him right where he belongs. No, Al! Right there. I gotta go out to the field, honey. I'll be back here in half an hour. Now, you get yourself all prettied up, 'cause it's gonna be our night to howl. Come on, smile. Aw, you feel better, maybe? Just a little bit? Al. You're-you're great! You tell that to all the guys. I know you. Now you got just 29 and a quarter minutes. O.K. O.K., boss! Al! Al Yackey, why you broken down... Look at those chickens. So you're a ground officer? Look at him, a colonel, fat and sassy. The seat of his pants shines better than his boots, too. How are you, captain Robertson? Welcome to new Guinea. Did you have a good trip? Smooth as silk. I brought a great bunch of pilots for you, too. Colonel Yackey, this is lieutenant Rourke and lieutenant Randall. What are you, colonel? The official greeter for the chamber of commerce? Randall? That's kind of funny. I thought for a minute you and I'd met up before someplace. No, sir. Lieutenant Ridley, this is captain Robertson, lieutenants Randall and Rourke. Aren't you afraid to go around without a parachute? You might fall into a spittoon in your office. Lieutenant Ridley'll show you fellas to your quarters. In case you'd like to have a drink, come over to the officer's club. Sounds like a fine idea. I'm gonna be with the prettiest gal in all new Guinea, that is, if you guys are interested in pretty gals. We'd be delighted, sir. That's swell. That's good. Well, listen to that. That big lug talking about dames and- I can't believe it. A colonel. I'd have been a 3-star- I'd have been a 4-star general. - Ginger beer. - Same. I don't mind Al being a colonel, but when I saw that star on Nails' shoulder, that finished me. Don't they have any privates in this war? Yeah, drinking ginger beer, laying off the liquor. He'll be a captain before long. He's my man. Here. You nibble on these while I'm gone. Dorinda! Hey, girl, it's me, Pete. Dorinda, you gotta listen to me, I... Now, look, Dorinda. I can take a lot, you know, and I have. Seeing Al and Nails was bad enough, but-but I guess this is the moment I've been afraid of all along. I wondered how I'd feel and how you would look. And you look good enough to eat, Dorinda. You look pretty as a picture. I think I'll just stay here a minute. You still the same girl? You know, Dorinda, some people seem prettier when you dream about them than they really are. But a funny thing about you- you're even prettier than the dream. Still my girl? Sure you are. Sure you are, and you always will be, won't you? You know a funny thing, Dorinda? I haven't forgotten one little thing that ever happened between us. I remember how you used to burn up when I'd ball you out about how you ham-handled a ship. I remember how you used to hop out of a ship, too. Always with a grease spot on your nose, right there. But I'll never forget the day we met in London. You were riding on top of the bus, and it was raining. The rain was on your face like on a flower. You weren't any too friendly, either. So when I busted up to you and said... I beg your pardon. I don't want to intrude, but you look exactly like a sister of mine. Well, that's a strange coincidence, isn't it? An amazing one. Because I bear a resemblance to my own sister, too. - Do you mind if I sit down? - No, not at all. My name is Ted Randall. - Lieutenant Randall? - That's right. I'm Dorinda Durston, ferry service. I'm glad to know you, Dorinda Durston. I admire the women's ferrying service. I've always thought it had such tremendous possibilities. I hope you won't be disappointed. I'm sure I won't be. Incidentally, I've only known you 2 minutes, and already I owe you an apology. Really? Yes. I'm here under false pretenses. Why, lieutenant! It's true. I have no sister. I felt sure you hadn't. Neither have I. How did you know? Well, it seems that somewhere a long time ago, that line was used before. Listen to this drivel. That's the trouble with these kids. You teach them something, and they don't know how to handle it. No judgment of women. Colonel Yackey. Good evening, sir. Hello, Randall. Here you are, honey. - I see you've met the lieutenant. - Yes, I've met lieutenant Randall. He says I remind him of his sisters. She's wise to him. Is that so? Sit down, sit down. How many sisters have you got? 11. Did you say 11? That's quite a family, 11 sisters. All very beautiful. And I remind him of every one of them. Maybe we better get you a drink. Hey, waiter. Bring us a drink for this boy. Lieutenant Randall is in my command, honey. They tell me he's a pretty hot pilot. He stinks. You have to be a hot pilot to be in Al's outfit. That's what I hear. How about all 3 of us having dinner tonight? I could cook you a kangaroo steak that will drive you crazy. How do you cook a kangaroo steak? With wallaby sauce. What a corny routine this is. Well, it sounds very interesting. I'd love to see it done sometime. Well, how about tonight? A celebration. Of what? Of my meeting you. Watch this. This'll be good. Watch him get set back on his heels. - No, I'm afraid not. - Come on, Dorinda. You haven't had any fun for a long time. She's always like this when she's on the ground. Skittish as a Colt. Tell him you'll go. Come on! Well, all right. Sure, I'll go. That's better. Come on! Let's get outta here. Al! Well, where have you been? Sydney, my boy. You have? Yeah. I just you back a load of spare parts. Good. You know, you shouldn't stay away so long, Dorinda. That flyer of yours has just been pining away since you was gone. Me too. Where is he? - He's up on security patrol. - How about a coke? No, I can't, Al. I've got to fill out my report. Yeah, I see. How's he been doing? Who? Ted, you goose. Him. He's doing all right. He got 3 more zeros. No! Yeah. I'll just have to cook him a dinner tonight. I'll cook one for you, too. I wouldn't want to gum up your party. Let's make tracks, baby. Holy leapin' loopin' Judas priest! Where's that security patrol? You dirty, no good, stinkin' sprite! Nails! Look! Here they come! Here come our kids. Get those meatballs. Boil 'em in oil. Tear 'em to pieces and fry 'em for breakfast. What'd you say? I didn't say a thing. O.K., boy, it's all yours. You're supposed to be doing something in this war besides making wisecracks to my girl, anyway. That's it. O.K., so you're lucky. Watch out! Easy, Dorinda. You don't have to worry about that fella, honey. He's just naturally the luckiest flier I ever did see. 'Pert near the best. If you are good, it's because I've been hanging around to keep you from breaking your fool neck. Look at that! Another one. I gotta admit you're good. Robertson. Hey, look at that! Look at that. There they go. Look at that! We got 6 out of 8. 6 out of 8! Yeah, and lost 1. There's nothing unusual about the shakes, Ted. You're just excited after the fight. I've seen a lot of guys have worse than the shakes after a good show. Sure, I know. I wasn't thinking about the fight so much as Robertson. He was a great guy, and a darn fine squadron commander, too. You know, it doesn't seem possible, when you stop to think about it, that they're not here anymore, and they're not gonna be. Has anything like that ever happened to you? Yes. A person's gotta forget, of course, but it's not easy at first. We gotta figure these things a little bit different than most people. There's something about going out in a plane that beats any other way. I suppose all the other branches of the service feel the same, but the guy that washes out at the controls of his own ship- well, he goes down doing the thing that he loved the best. That's a very special way to die. I never thought of it that way before, but it's true, all right. Ted, you're not gonna have any eyebrows left if you don't stop it. Like with a flower. Stop it! Well, I guess we better get on our horse before this turns into a wake. No, no. It's my fault. Don't go, sir. I need a good drink and a night's sleep. I'm sorry if I did anything wrong. There's nothing wrong with you. It's me. And everything wrong with you, I like. Good night. Breakfast? Sure. Good night, sir. Good night. Did you see what he was doing? Yeah, I saw. The things he does, the way he acts sometimes. You know, honey, I got a hunch. You're falling for this guy. No! No? No, no. It's not that. It's-well, it's hard to explain. I- I get such a queer feeling sometimes, watching him. Yeah, I know. I know, honey. I know just how you feel. I gotta go now. Good night. Good night, Al. Don't let that baby-faced killer pull the wool over your eyes. You know what I mean. Or do ya? Remember, you're still my girl. Lieutenant Randall, it is my privilege to bestow upon you the distinguished flying cross awarded for bravery, heroism, and extraordinary achievement while in aerial flight. And upon the recommendation of your superior officer, and with the approval of your commander in chief, you have been promoted to the rank of captain. - My congratulations, sir. - Thank you, sir. They're passing out that hardware to everybody these days. Dismissed! Congratulations! Thanks a lot, guys. I hope you'll excuse me, but I got some kind of special plan for this afternoon. All the luck in the world! Thanks. Everything all ready, powerhouse? Captain, everything's all fixed. What special thing could he have planned now? Come in! Out here! Hello! Aw! Ted, you idiot. Hey, look, 2 bars. I'm a captain. I've got a medal, too. Why don't you say something? Give me a chance. You're the prettiest girl in all the world. You're prettier than a p-38. Ted, I know what's the matter with you. You're crazy. Not really crazy. I've just come to a decision, that's all. Decision? What? Dorinda, I'm gonna marry you. You're going to marry me? That's it, marry you. You're gonna be Mrs. Ted Randall, my wife. Me? I'll be your husband. Get it? It's not the most original idea on earth. It's been done before, but... Never with 2 people like us. - You mean you and I? - That's it, married. M- a-double r-i-e-d. The judge goes so and so and so and so, and you're married. You will, won't you? Ted, I... Yes. Hooray! Come on in, guys! Surprise! Ted, you fool! Yahoo! What took you so long? Yeah! All the food will be cold. We thought you'd never say yes! Lots of luck. You'll need it with him. Play it again! Play it again! Again! Aw. Aw, this is the way it's gonna be from now on, you and me and real living. When this show is over, I'm gonna buy the sweetest little plane on earth. We'll fly together, just the 2 of us, right over the top of the earth. Darling. I never used to like to fly with anybody before, but I think I'm gonna like it with you. Mademoiselle and monsieur? Yes? Come and get it. Dandy. Where'd you get all this beautiful food? It's a military secret. Play it again! Play it again! Again! To Mrs. Ted Randall! Hooray! To Mr. Randall! Hooray! Well, what's the matter? I was just thinking, you were pretty sure of yourself, weren't you? Why, what do you mean? What would you have done if I'd said no? Ho ho. Play the other one, boys! No! 'Tention! What is this, a convention? Carry on, boys. Congratulate me, sir. O.K. What for? Dorinda and I are gonna be married. - No? - Yes! - Is that right? - That's right, Al. That's swell. Congratulations, Ted. Thank you very much, sir. I feel a little bit like a late spring frost coming in here like this, but your replacements are here and Nails wants you to whip them into shape. When? I'm afraid right now. He didn't know this was gonna happen. O.K., o.K. Come on, fellas, let's go! A lot of firsts for me today. First time I ever got engaged. The first time I ever led my own squadron. Don't forget to keep the wine cold. And the food hot. Sure thing. Follow me over to field. Wish me luck, darling. You won't need it. And keep my medal for me, will ya? Are you sure you trust me with it? What do you think? Climb in, Romeo. You know, you're not sitting as pretty as you think you are. You're engaged, all right, but you're not married yet. You really wanna keep her? Well, I'm gonna tell you something. She just loves crazy fliers. She always has. How do you think I ever got her? Go on, put on something fancy, money bags. She'd love it. So would Nails. Why don't you break away from the squadron? Tell 'em to keep their eye on you, you'll show 'em what the service really expects of 'em. Go on, kid, you won't get into trouble. Go ahead. She thinks you're wonderful. Don't disappoint her. Put on a show for her. Lieutenant Rourke, assume commander of squadron. Tell the new men to keep an eye on me. I'll give them a small idea of what we expect down here. Roger. What's he doing? I don't know, honey. But whatever it is, it ain't good. This plane'll hold up under anything. You know that. Come on, you lady killer, fly this crate right down to the wing bolts. And don't forget this. She once had a guy who really knew how to fly an airplane. She can fly this well herself. Go on, fly it. Go on down there and take the tops off those trees. Hey, hey, take it easy now, take it easy. You don't have to overdo it, you know. Nails is going to love that one. Nice flying. Yeah. Well, from now on, son, it's between you and your maker. I'm stuck, I can't think of anything more. Sir. Thanks, sergeant. Well, looks like we're gonna do something besides play around here for the rest of the day. Colonel Yackey. Yes, sir. See ya later, honey. Colonel, tell that young idiot to report to me the minute he lands. Yes, sir. Just what did you do that for? I don't know. I guess I was kind of a fool. Yeah, I guess you were. You might have been a fool, Ted, but you're the kind of fool that knows how to fly an airplane. There's nothing I can do for you now, bub. Come on. The boss wants to see you. This'll cost that guy every leave he'll have for the next 6 months. He'll have to get married in the guard house. Yeah, that's possible. By the way, the boss wants to see you. Me? O.K, but let me see what Nails does to him. After that, I can take anything. I just wanna see how he takes a demotion. You go on home. I'll be over to see you after I'm through. Don't worry. It may not be as bad as you think. - Good luck. - Thanks. Sergeant, drive miss Durston to her quarters. Bye. You wanted to see me, sir. Yes. I watched that show you put on up there. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why I did it. Guess I went a little overboard. I know why you did it. Don't do those things, captain. You're a squadron commander now. Yes, sir. What's the matter with you? You going soft? This guy should be busted. You're good, Randall. You're so good, I've got a job here you might go for. I'll take it, sir. Better have a look at it first. What is this, a tea par... I'll still take it, sir. You understand, this is no ordinary mission? Headquarters seem to think a p-38 is the ship to do it. See that? That's palibuk, palibuk island. Right there is the biggest enemy munitions dump in the pacific. Observation gives us clear weather all the way. You'll take off in time to be over palibuk around midnight. Just get your bombs in, then twist out fast, right? I understand, sir. You must make every effort to destroy your target and then return, understand? I'm not eager to have any dead heroes on my hands. That's all. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir. - Bring your book. - Get me a3. Imagine that. If that'd been me up there, I'd have been sent to Scotland for the rest of my life. That guy draws on the juiciest job in the outfit. A difference in character, I guess. He's got a pretty tough assignment, at that. Well, you got one, too. Me? The boss wants to see you, remember? Yeah. I almost forgot. Go on in. I'll wait out here. Come in. Major Sandidge reporting, sir. At ease. Well? Well, there isn't much to say, sir. I didn't think it would do any harm to put the kid through his paces. That's not the truth. You were jealous of him. Why should I be jealous of him, sir? I'm a better flyer than he'll ever be. Sit down. Yes, sir. I don't think you really grasp what our work is all about up here. Yes sir, sure I do. I know we're supposed to follow through with these men and make better flyers out of them. That's only part of it. I'm sorry it wasn't made clearer to you at the beginning. It isn't just you as an individual helping your man as an individual. It's all of us working together for the future. Every man that ever flew... It's hard for me to put it into words, Sandidge, if you don't feel it. I think I understand, sir. No, I don't think you understand at all. Let's put it this way. Have you ever been up in your plane at night, alone, somewhere - 20,000 feet above the ocean? Yes, sir. Did you ever hear music up there? Perhaps. If you've heard it, you'll remember it. It's the music a man's spirit sings to his heart when the earth's far away and there isn't any more fear. It's the high, fine, beautiful sound of an earthbound creature who grew wings and flew up high and looked straight into the face of the future and caught just for an instant the unbelievable vision of a free man in a free world. If you haven't heard it, there's no way I can talk to you. I've heard it. I have heard it, sir. I used to try to explain it to some kids, but I could never find words. Children would understand. Sure. Because the future belongs to them. They're already moving into it. They're going to climb out of the dust and muck and lift up their heads and see the sky. They're going to fly like a generation of angels into the free air and sunlight. Yeah, sure. Children would always understand. Free as the air. Men have said that ever since they've crawled out of caves and came down from trees. That's what we're fighting for, the freedom of the very air we breathe, the freedom of mankind rushing to greet the future on wings. Can you understand that? Can you? Yes sir, I do. No man is really dead unless he breaks faith with the future. And no man is really alive unless he accepts his responsibility to it. That's the chance we're giving you here, the opportunity to pay off to the future, what you owe for having been part of the past. It's just another way of saying, "I'm glad I lived. "I'm glad I was alive. Now let me give you a hand." You thought you were choosing between life and death when you flew in over that carrier, but you weren't. You're choosing between 'em now. It's up to you, Pete. If you please, sir, I'd like to go back. I think I can do my job now. Very well. You may go. Thank you, sir. Dorinda. Dorinda, I got something to tell you. I've been learning a lot, Dorinda. I've learned that this thing that's going on is bigger than you and me. It's bigger than any of us. We don't count, Dorinda. We're just nothing. And yet, if we do the job we're supposed to do, we could be great people. I wish you could hear what I'm saying to you, Dorinda. When I look at you now, I sure wish I'd been different. Wish I'd told you a lot of things that I thought of but I just couldn't find the words to say 'em. Wish I'd told you how cute your nose is and how it turns up at the end all of a sudden, and how good the smell of your hair is, how your eyes light up when you laugh, and how you fit into my arms just as though you belonged there. But I didn't tell you. It serves me right. You know, this guy of yours is going on a dangerous job, as tough as they come. And I just want you to know that I'll bring him back, Dorinda. He's going to be all right, Dorinda. Don't worry about it. Do you know what I'm really trying to tell you? I'm trying to tell you something I never told anybody before. I love you. I love you, Dorinda, with all my heart, and I want you to be happy. And if marrying this guy is gonna make you happy, that's what I want. I figure I'll hunt myself another assignment if I pull this off, one that's not so close to home. Good-bye, Dorinda. We'd have made a great pair. Hey. The door was open. Pete! Ted. Dorinda, what is it? Nothing. Nothing... I just wasn't expecting you, that's all. I had a few minutes, so I thought I'd come by and say good night to you. What is it, Dorinda. What is it? Ted... Yes? I've got something to tell you. Go ahead. I- I'm not going to marry you. But what's the matter? I haven't been honest with you, Ted. I'm not in love with you, Ted. I thought I was, but I'm not. I'm in love with a guy named Pete Sandidge. - Stop it, Dorinda. - Yes, I am. You're too nice a person to fool, Ted. I just realized it, about myself, I mean. I guess when a woman loves once, she loves for keeps. Anyway, that's the way it is with me. But he's dead, Dorinda. That doesn't make any difference, Ted. That was real love, like food and drink and air and water. There's no substitute. You wouldn't want a substitute, would you? Because then, you'd never have the real thing. You'd only have a cheap imitation, and... That would hurt us both. You sure you mean what you're saying? Yes, Ted, I'm so sure, so sure. I haven't got much time. I have to go right now. I wish I could stay and talk with you. It wouldn't do any good, Ted. Honest, it wouldn't. Well... If that's it, that's it. It was too good to be true, anyway. I really should have known better. Good night, Ted. Bye, Dorinda. Do you mind if I hate Pete... Just for a little while? Dorinda, I'm just on my way to headquarters. I had to stop and tell you something, something I think you oughta know. What? I've seen you take one awful hard jolt with Pete. Well, I gotta fix you for another one. All right, Al, go ahead. Well, Ted's got himself a pretty tough job cut out for tonight. A job like what? Like blowing up a jap ammunition dump. What are his chances, Al? Well, I... No so good, Dorinda. Where is this ammunition dump? I can't tell you that. You know that. Military secret? That's right. What do you mean, military secret between you and me, Al? You think I've been crisscrossing this country for the last 6 months without getting wise to a thing or 2? There are only 2 ammunition dumps that amount to anything. One's at palibuk and the other San laurentia. Palibuk's the biggest. That's the one, isn't it? Al, you think Ted has a chance of coming back alive? It could be done. I'm going back with you. Look, Dorinda... I said I'm going back with you! I've got to talk to Ted! We made it. There's his ship. Good. I'm glad. They're in operations. You want to wait in my office? No. No, you go on in. I'll wait out here. I guess you'd rather see him alone. Now, it's all clear to you... Yes, sir. 6 minutes. Have a cup of coffee. Hi, powerhouse! Hi! What are you doing here? Just getting this flying bomb ready for that guy of yours. Boy, I wish I were going on this trip. Maybe you will be. Nails wants to see you. He does? Don't cut it. I'll hold it for you. All right. Keep 'em revved up! O.K. And if they get hot, cut 'em. Yeah. Hey, Dorinda! What's that? Dorinda, I know what you're doing and you're wrong. Ted and I could have pulled this job off. Turn around, Dorinda, turn around and go back. Now, Dorinda, you've got to listen to me. You've got to turn around. You can't do this! Everything you're doing is against orders, Dorinda. It doesn't make any sense! Now look, Dorinda, I know you're a great little flyer, but you're not a fighter pilot. You know, a lot more depends on this job than just blowing up an ammunition dump! Suppose you don't make the grade? Did you ever stop to think of that? You'll tip off the whole show! Guys hundreds of miles from here will be dying just because you got scared and started running away from yourself. Dorinda, you're throwing your life away trying to do a job that somebody else could have done. You're throwing your life away because you're afraid to do your own job. You're afraid of living. You're afraid of life. And that's double-crossing a lot of guys who are out there fighting for it. You can't do that, not my Dorinda. Dorinda! Dorinda, kick that rudder and get this crate out of here! Dorinda, you've got to hear me! Listen to me! Don't be a pig-headed fool! They've spotted us. All right, I'm right behind you, Dorinda. Open up that hot lead! Now, Dorinda! Come on, twist her out, Dorinda, twist her out! Put her nose up into the moon! Now just settle back and let this little sweetheart take you home. Got some dirt on your face again, didn't you? That's better. Now just point her nose in the air and climb straight for heaven. Higher, Dorinda, higher. Listen, Dorinda. There it is. You hear it? I can tell you now, Dorinda. I can tell you everything I've ever wanted to tell you. You're going back and you're gonna have a swell life, Dorinda. You're gonna have a wonderful life. Everything's gonna seem prettier than it was before. The rain's gonna have a little more smell to it. The trees are gonna seem a little greener. And the nights are gonna be all chock full of stars. And when you go to sleep, Dorinda, you're not gonna have any bad dreams. And when that morning sunlight hits you in the face, you're gonna wake up laughing. And what's more, you're going out with people, and you're gonna have all the things that they have, including love. You know, the only decent thing I ever did in my life was love you, Dorinda. But if the memory of that love is gonna make you unhappy all the rest of your life, there must have been something wrong with it. It should've been the kind that filled your heart so full of love that you just had to go out and find someone to give it to. That's the only real kind, isn't it, Dorinda? That's the only kind that ever lives. You know, I find myself wondering what kind of kids you two will have. I'd like to talk to those kids sometime. I think I could tell 'em something. I think I could tell them about life, how good it is, how good it can be. And how the decent things in life never die. And how the only kind of love worth having is the kind that goes on living and laughing and fighting... And loving. There he is, Dorinda. Go on. I'm setting you free, Dorinda. I'm moving out of your heart. Good-bye. Good-bye, darling. That's my girl. And that's my boy.
