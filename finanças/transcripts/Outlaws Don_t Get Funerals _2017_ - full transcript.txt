Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm a dangerous man. When I get hell-bent on something, I can be, downright mean. I get over zealous and, I can be forgetful of others, insensitive to their pain. It's my experience that, zeal is, the most dangerous characteristic a man can possess. There's no talking to zeal. Now, all I need to do is get a name. All you need to do is give me one. I have a way of doing things. There's an order to it. I used to ask questions first. Before the nails, I mean. I would ask, and they would lie, then I'd have to nail them to the table, and start all over again asking my questions. I'm a busy man, time is gold, you understand. So now, I always start with the nails. Pardon my grin. Clarence. Thanks for coming to the house, bro. Sit down. And these children are beautiful. I can't believe Mina. She's turning sixteen. We're gonna have a big party. Cigar? No, no thanks. So? You're not gonna like this. You want me to take care of it? No, you've done your part. Let's get you paid my bro. How much money are you keeping, around the house these days? Why, you looking to rob me? It's just not safe. I've told you that before. Mother hen, always watchful. Relax, this is collection night. This all going back to Norik's house. So he sends his own people? At the end of every week. On a motorcycle, no less. My nephew. Very fast, very efficient. Thank you for everything, my friend. Enough business, let me show you something very beautiful. I have had this made, for Mina for her sixteenth birthday. She's a very special girl. I spared no expense. Norik knows this diamond guy in Burbank. He's going to put the center stone. It's going back to him for finishing. How lovely. Alright, home sweet home. Wow, this is a nice place. Really, you like it? I wouldn't say, I thought it was nice place, if I didn't like it? That's cool. Did you like the band? I did. That's cool. I like music. Good for you, sweetie! Music is the language of the soul. Cool. Let's go to your bedroom. I need to pee. Oh, you do? Yeah, I need to pee. I'll be right back. Take your clothes off, okay? Oh no, that's alright. I can wait for... No. I want you naked. When I come back, I want my boy waiting for me, with nothing on but a smile, you hear? Alright. Bedroom. Across the living room. Hey, I-What the fuck. Rad place. Very pawnable. Good job. I wanna rob a bank. It's hard work and lots of planning, if you wanna get it right. First bank I ever robbed was with my dad. I was 17. He did all the planning, and carried the gun. I just drove on the day. We're kinda screwed on cash here. How much? 147.44. Do you want to stay another night? We can. I say we fill up the tank, and drive out to Flagstaff, shake down some college kid. They got Arizona U near there. Business school kid or something, maybe? Oh, what's the fun in having a gun, if you can't rob a bank. I feel ya. It's in my blood. Robbing banks, I mean. My dad, his dad. So, when you say you wanna do one of them, I think it's pretty goddamn righteous. Well let's do it then. You know, ripping off hipsters and frats boys is, complete fucking drag. Let's do something big. Bonnie would have never stood for this rinky dink shit. Bonnie? Parker. And that's just how you'll end up, too sweety. Life's not a movie. You sure? It's got tragedy written all over it. It's a bank, it's not a scared kid. With a bank, you don't plan it right, if you're unlucky, you can loose everything. My father was killed in a bank robbery, you know that right. Okay forget banks, then. How about a, a poker game? I've seen that in movies. Some gangster with a poker game, and we come through the doors with shotguns. And nobody can call the cops because, it's all illegal anyway. And you know this gangster with the poker game. No but we can find one. I mean we know people we can ask. Come on, you're not thinking creatively. There's money out there Fred. So much of it. And it's just sitting in people's pockets. Let's figure out how we can take it. You know my grandfather was real creative. He used to robbed banks and, bars and restaurants, pharmacies, whatever you name it. He's famous. In newspapers and everything. Nuh uh. Yeah he is. Boe Carroll. He killed a lady a year before I was born. He ran her over in his car, leaving a smash and grab actually at a car dealership. They gave him life for that. You're making it up. I'm not. Boe Carroll. Grandpa Boe. Look it up. Look it up. Boe Carroll. A celebrity in the family. Why haven't you mentioned him before? Not exactly something most people are proud of. They have internet. Don't us it. It's probably expensive as hell. We'll put it on the cards. He sold robberies, more than anything else. Find a mark, stake it out for years. Seriously, years. He'd figure out where the entrance and the exit were, and then pinpoint when the place would be flush with cash. And then, when the time was right, he'd either sell the job, or if it was real special he'd do it himself. My dad actually worked a lot with him. They made a real living doing it, back in the day when you could make a real living doing it. Here he is! Boe Carroll. He's handsome. He had my dad when he was like nineteen, so they were more like brothers than anything else. Fred, Freddie. Grandpa's a free man. What? Yep. There did a news story about it. Bullshit they gave him life. Yeah. Released last October. He's been out a year. Intermediate life sentence. Indeterminate. Indeterminate life sentence. I thought life in prison meant life in prison. Who decides how long a life is? Holy shit. Boe, is that you? Cause all I can see is an old man. It's me, Artie. I'm in here somewhere. C'mere, before I start crying. When Ann died I traded our house for this place, and I never got around to, exactly decorating. Why'd you sell your house? It was too much to maintain. Too much room. That was Ann's house, right? The one on Glenoaks? Yeah. I took the cash from the sale of the house, for a little retirement. Savings only go so far, and God knows the government only helps out so much. That was her parents house, no? I mean she grew up there. Situations change. You know, When I got all the paper work for the parole board, and I saw your address wasn't Glenoaks, I felt a chill. Time goes by, Boe. I don't have to tell you that. No. Anyway, look, this place is more than enough for me, and plenty of room for a guest. You're more than welcome here. I mean it. I got to thank you Artie, for taking me in. What we been through, come on? To be honest, it'll be nice to have a friend, to shoot the shit with. Yeah. By the way, sorry about Ann. Oh yeah well. Everybody's gotta die right. People we love gotta die, we gotta die. You feel sad about that you gotta be sad about everything, you know what I mean? Yeah. Look at the talk I'm giving you. Right out of jail 25 fucking years, haven't seen each other in 10, and this is the talk I'm giving you right through the door. It's alright, Artie. Alright, alright. You want to go on the tour? See your room? Oh would you mind if I sit for a minute? Yeah of course, of course. Eight hours from Susanville. What a jerk I am. Sit your ass on the couch. Sit, relax. I'm gonna turn the game on, I was about to open up a jar of olives. Hey Boe, you want a beer? A beer? Yeah. You got it. Oh I see you found the olives. Speaking of heaven. You'll get your bearings. You get on a schedule, a routine. Get a hobby. Millions of channels on the TV. Did you get TV in the can at the end there? Yeah some. Well I'm gonna turn you on to a lot of new programs. You ever hear of Net flick? No. Movies in the mail. Oh, by the way, you gotta see your parole officer this week? Yeah Monday. What does he expect you to do till then? Well they gave me gate money, the phone number for SSI. 25 years, they put you on a bus, goodbye, good luck? 26. You see a counselor in there? Something? Oh yeah. Lots of swell advice. Dirt bags. Don't worry, pal. I'm gonna take care of you, and get you on your feet, just the way you did for me. What did I ever do for you? What you loose your memory, old timer. You gave me my first professional gig. City of Industry. I knew you wouldn't have forgotten. Wells Fargo. It was the first and only bank I ever took. Up til then what was I doin, knocking off liquor stores, with a sawed-off and a lot of hollering. But you gave me that plan for a song. You remember, what was it? Five hundred dollars or something. The timeline, the getaway plan, the alarm box combo, the whole enchilada. You had me dress, what was it, the blue overalls, and the yellow hard hat, cause there was a construction site across the street. The police come, they're looking for the perp, what do they see? 13 fuckers dressed the same way. It was beautiful. That was the most beautiful thing I was ever involved in. I walked away with 50,000 dollars. 50,000 dollars 1965. Bought Ann's parent's house, we bought that maid service. Mickey was born that summer. You got my whole life going for 500 dollars. I'll never forget you for that. You're welcome Artie. What does it say? Go to bed. Here we are. It's a little sparse, but you know we go to Ikea, get you some nice stuff. My grandson says this is pretty comfortable, actually. Boe? Can I come in? Yeah. Yeah sure, come on in. You awake? It's okay. What do you need? You got a car? Yeah, yeah sure. I got a car. You want to go somewhere? Ann's house. Your place on Glenoaks. Boe, I already told you, it's gone. What do you mean gone? Someone else is livin there. Some, I don't know, Pakistani family. I thought it could wait a day, but it can't. I got to go now. Why do you have to go to Ann's house? I gotta get something. Something I buried. Something you buried? Before I went away. In the back yard, behind the fence. In '79? How deep are we talkin? You're still a crazy motherfucker. All those years of good behavior, you were just killing time, weren't you? What else you gonna do in jail, Arthur? I told you it'd still be there. You buried it deep enough. What you want to do, get us both locked up? No, not again. Not ever. What the fuck? Let's get some sleep. Fuck that. You're showing me what's in there, right now. It's private, okay? Not okay. Open that thing. You ever do any time Arthur? What does that got to do with anything? No, you've never done a day. Look I am aware, that I've been very lucky and you got fucked over. You've never had to take a shit, in a room the size of a closet, with another man watching you, getting ready to take a shit himself, and you're gonna have to watch him, or at least smell it. Cause sure you could turn away, but you have to smell it. Breath it. Boe, you can't stay here, if you don't show me what's inside the box. 26 years I waited to dig this up. It's the only privacy I've got left in the world. It's all I've got left to myself. I mean 26 miserable god damned years, I spent every night dreaming of this box. It was out here, in the world, buried where only I knew. My ass may have belonged to the state, but this box, buried, locked, untouched. This I could claim for myself. You speak of good behavior, oh there was lots of that. Yes sir, no ma'am. But the shameful cocksuckery of that, was made just about barely endurable, by being able to lay down every night and dream, of the one place on God's earth I could still call my own. Arthur, you're my friend, my only friend in the world, but I cannot show you what's in this box. I will not. What about your parole officer, you gonna show him? Cause he's gonna come over, he's gonna search through your shit, and he's gonna see a steel cash box, and believe me, I think he's gonna want a peek inside. No. During the day we'll keep it in your room. We'll lock it in your closet. At night it stays with me. What do you got in there? Some teddy bear? You wanna sleep with it? Under the pillow if comfort allows. What am I gonna do with you? Thanks for understanding Arthur. No I don't understand. I'm giving in. Sometimes that's what it takes. Goodnight. Goodnight. So, what's your plan? You got one? No. You want butter? Yeah. You want a job? No. I mean I'm not asking because I need the money. I'll feed you, that's not the problem. Listen, retirement's a beautiful thing, don't get me wrong. It's just that, you really gotta fill your days, you know. I figured that out after Ann passed away. Before that all I was doing was walking around, bored and drunk. Had scotch at noon, and then 10, eight o' clock with breakfast. Sounds a good idea to me. Except it's not a good idea. Especially when it stops you from filling your days. Okay. So, what's your plan? I recon I'll follow your lead. How do you spend a day? Well. It's a peaceful life. Fine. See this old timer, here? Huh? Guy across the street, walking the dog. It's connected. To what? Armenian mafia. Or whatever they call themselves. They're always hanging out in front. Like a pack of dogs, barking at each other, barbecuing strange meats at all hours. They play poker right on the front porch, and the cops don't even bother them. Hollering like little kids, fuckin nuisance. Drive like assholes, any speed they want. You hear that motorcycle yet? Oh yeah I heard that. Middle of the fucking night, revving his engine. He stops at the same house all the time. Here he comes with his dog. What kind of dog is that? I don't know why don't you ask him? Sir! I was just joking. Hello sir. Yes? What kind of dog do you got there? This little gentleman is a lhasaapso. He's beautiful. I thank you on his behalf. What's your name, my friend? Who's asking? You look familiar to me. We know each other? Forgive me, I am Levon. Arthur. Friends call me Boe. Boe the thief. It is you. You guys know each other? We drank too much ouzo one night, at one of my brother's restaurants. He made him a lot of money. His name was on my brother's tongue. You've been gone a long time, haven't you my bro. When did you come back to the land of the living? A week ago. Welcome back my bro. Shan tula! I'm having you both for dinner. No it's alright, we wouldn't want to impose. I insist. My wife, she makes enough food for an army. Do you like lamb? That's alright, I got a chicken in the oven. I love lamb. It is settled. We are having lamb, drinking ouzo, and reminiscing about the old days. Let me finish up with the doggie business, I come back okay. Don't go anywhere. Hang up, I'll walk with you. Sorry to wake ya. How was dinner? That is a lovely family. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Two little boys. A lovely, girl of 15. That's nice. My chicken is in the oven. You eat? Oh yeah, lots. Wife's name's Nora. Hell of a cook. Good lamb? And how. Lots of spice, they cook it real fast on a high flame. Must be some kind of marinade. Yeah must be. Fine house. Big back yard. Bunch of room for kids to run and play. He's also got a little office down stairs. Lots of privacy, got his own entrance and a patio. Levon took me out there after dinner. Smokes, cigars. He's a proud man. A man of power, some might say. I'd say, careless. I mean, take a strange dog like me into his home? Let me loose around those little kids? What else is he careless with? I mean, did he leave it out there in the open on purpose? Was I meant to see it? Is he just that stupid? See what? A bag. A big bag. It was zipped tight, but it didn't take much imagination, to figure what was inside. Shapes, Artie. There are certain shapes a man in my line of work, will recognize, bagged or no, 26 years away or no. It had to be cash. I could smell it. 20 grand at least in there, even if it was all singles, which I doubt. There was guns too on top. I could see them. No safe, just a bag, out there, in the middle of the desk. Quite a conversation piece, except I didn't make peep one. I could go in the back with a shotgun. If that old gangster got in my way, or any of those brat offspring of his, or that fat cunny of a wife of his? I'd blast their goddamn faces off. Oh my God, that'd be the real prize. To be myself once again. Go in like a wolf one last time. Raging fangs and claws. Come out with all that cash. Covered in blood, pockets full of dough. That old time feeling. Is it wrong to still dream? I'll tell you straight, Artie, just between you and me. That girl I killed, on the job they sent me away for? I'd kill her a thousand times over. When I went up in front of the parole board, they asked me, what I'd have done different with my life? How I would have lived it better? I told them what they wanted to hear. The truth is, I'd have been worse. Much worse. You hear this Artie? You hear it? Levon and his bag! It's an old fashioned pickup. On a motorcycle, no less. All you'd need is a pistol, a mask, good escape route, and a little nerve. Oh, shit. What's the matter? I can't get the Chrysler building right. Looks like New York to me. How's your crossword puzzle? Nearly done. Good. You want eggplant for dinner? Sure. Hey Boe, I left a half a turkey sandwich, for ya in the kitchen. Alright, okay. I'll see ya tomorrow. You never seen that picture? No. Well it's fabulous. Glen Ford plays this bad guy, turns out to be this charming son of a bitch. it's a classic. We'll get it from the Net flick. Yeah hello. Yeah this is Artie Twine. Whose this? Yeah one sec. Says he's your grandson. You got a grandson? Maybe. How'd he find me? How'd you get my number? He says he gave his I.D. to the prison, and they gave him my info. What does he want? Yeah, Yeah, this is he. And you're Frank's son right? Freddie? Yeah, that was my father's name. I hope you've had better luck with it than he did. So what's going on? What a cute couple hey. How you doin? Mr. Twine? No, no, no, no, no, no. Not Mr. Twine. It's Artie, Artie. Come on, come on, come on in. Boe's washing up. Boe! It smells delicious in here. Oh thank you, dear. Uh, Artie, this is my fiancee Robin. Oh hello fiance Robin. Thanks a million for having us. Oh please please, come on, we're gonna have a fabulous dinner here. Hi. Hi! Dad always had some scam going. There was a Christmas eve I was, eight or nine, he had me with him selling, a truck load of televisions. I helped him load it and everything. Got a little Schwarzenegger here, lifting televisions. They were actually just boxes. The thing of it was he had all these brand new boxes but, we didn't have any televisions. Where'd you get the boxes? He raided the dumpster of news station, in Studio City. Apparently he'd been eyeing the place, to nab it for some equipment, but it was like a fortress, there was cameras everywhere and shit. One day though, he sees they're dumping, all these brand new boxes, and he gets an idea. That's so cool. He must have been broke, because looking back on it now, it was a hell of a risk. We hooked up with this guy in Orange County. Dad shows him the truck full of boxes, everything's on the up and up. We put cinder blocks in the ones along the outside, so the weight felt right, and in one we put our own TV from the goddamn living room. It wasn't even the same model as the one on the box, but we polished it like it was brand new, and it was passable. Dad opens the box, gives the guy a peek, some bullshit about how it's Christmas Eve, and he's got his kid with him, and if we could make this fast. I mean if the guy had looked into one more box, the game would have been over for the both of us, but fuck if he had met his asking price in cash, and thanked us for the bargain. Damn. That takes some balls. Huh, Boe? Cute little Freddie. Were you scared? Nah, it was great. Mom picked us up afterwards, and we went to Denny's, and then after that we went to K-Mart. I got like twenty Ninja Turtle action figures. He was a good guy. I know it sounds bad, takin his kid with him to do shady things but, he was just trying to give me a good Christmas. He only ever knew one way of doing things, you know? It was cops killed him? Yeah. During or coming out? Coming out. In the parking lot. Who shot first? I don't know. They say he did. He kill anyone? One cop, yeah. Everyone through picking, or should we have some dessert? Artie, this cake is dreamy. Use the whole can of frosting, it is a special night. Aren't you just the cutest thing? Little old me? You have a great energy about you, Artie, I mean it. What did you do before you retired? Armed robbery. I didn't keep the original when it was in the paper but, Robin went on the internet and printed it. It was in the Tribune. My mom's family is in Illinois so, when she got sick, I went out there with her. Dreary goddamn place if you ask me, but the banks are plenty warm and welcoming. How much you run off with? Not enough. Well, no shortage of banks in L.A. No, but people change. They get smarter. That's what I'm trying to do. Look the point is, if I'm putting you in a strange spot just by asking, you say so, I'll keep my mouth shut about it. You got my word on that okay. Okay. The girl and I are looking for a job. The girl? It's her idea, practically. She's the outlaw type. Any dip-shit with a gun can go into a liquor store, but there's a way to do things, and there's a way to do things. So I guess what I'm asking is, you got any bright ideas, grandpa? Oh my. Do you believe in God? What? Cake time! I hear gunfire. I'll know it went bad. Art. Artie, you going to bed? You hear that? No. Why you sitting over there by the window? I'm not. I'm going to bed. What the fuck? You hear that commotion last night? Yeah, helicopters, sirens all that shit. Something went down. I think it was your little friend Levon. My little friend? Yeah Levon, across the street. I went out for the newspaper this morning, and he's gotta bunch of gangster buddies on his lawn. I think he's gathered himself a posse. You want some cheese? That was the back door. I'll get it. Ah it's the kids. Is everything alright? No, can we come in? What did I say about gunfire? They started it. Okay I'm just gonna take a little look. It's bleeding less than it was last night. The bullet wasn't that deep. I took it out with tweezers. How much have you had to drink, sweetheart? I don't know. It hurts. Okay, no more, no more. The kid on the bike pulled a gun? No there was someone else was there. Someone else? I watched that drop every week for a year. Well, someone else was watching it too, and you missed it. We had the loot ready to go, and some nigger comes out of nowhere, with a fucking gun, blasting shit up. Don't call him that. He shot you! It doesn't matter. A nigger? I tried unloaded on him, but it was dark. Robin took the guy on the bike out with the shotgun, I just threw her over my shoulder and got out of there. With the loot. That's right, baby. With the loot. We need to get her to a hospital. No, Artie. You've got to, honey. We gotta call an ambulance, now. She goes to the hospital, she's going to jail. No hospital. I've been trying to take her all night. She doesn't want to go. We gotta force her. The bullet's out. She stops bleeding maybe she'll get better. What if it doesn't stop bleeding? What if you didn't get the whole bullet? I could sew her up. I've done it before. She could be bleeding inside. She could have a heart attack, drop dead. We gotta call an ambulance now. She doesn't want it, and I don't blame her. It's asking to get locked up. She doesn't know the trouble she's in. She could have an infection, she could go into septic shock. Well, you got antibiotics, right? Yeah. From when you had walking pneumonia. So. We'll give them to her, and I could sew her up proper. I've done it before. If she's looking worse tomorrow, we convince her into going to emergency. I mean come on, I've seen guys pull back from way worse than this. So how does that sound to you, young lady? Robin? How'd your wife die? Cancer. In her tits. Same with my mom. Careful. Your father had a taste for that shit, too. And I can also get out of hand with the booze. It kind of runs in the family I guess. I swear to god, I'm gonna shoot that motherfucker's dick off. Who? The black motherfucker in the suit. Comes out of the shadows, guns blazing? What kind of fucking evil, bushwhacking shit is that? Yeah rough break. Hello? What? Who the fuck are you? Easy does it friend. What the fuck? Everything okay in there? All good. Just hang loose out in front. Have fun. That's my partner out in front. I'm a police officer. Police officer. That's right. How did you get in here? The door was open. You just can't come in here. - Well sure I can. - I want you out of here now. No thank you. I have a few questions to ask you. I don't give a fuck what you want. I want you out of here now! In fact, I'm callin the real police. Get the girl. We know whose livin here with you. And we know his abilities. Now, my boss wants to know three things. And if you tell me these three things, these nails will be the worst of your pain. They just come right out. One, where's the loot? Two, where's the masked young men who took it? Three, where's the old dog that planned it? Just like that. One, two, three. My turn to talk? This is your time. Okay, alright. I'm gonna come clean. What choice do I have, right? I just want some peace. I just want to go back to my boring life. Watching TV, cooking, doing my paintings. I've got no more fight in me. Forgive me. I'm gonna tell you everything. You know Magilla Gorilla? The cartoon gorilla. Me and him robbed your boss. Magilla he wanted the money. I mean all those, little hats he wears, they're very expensive. We didn't want anybody hurt you know but, he just went bananas. I'll never forget him. His face. Yeah, black, you said. Did I ever say what I'll do if I ever see him again? Shoot him in the cock. You said that, too. Shoot his cock off. Whatever. Get the shovel, and get in the car. We'll stash the loot and get back to Arthur. We're just gonna leave her here? You want to stay? No, I want to wait. I want to say something. Goodbye or something. She was my sweetheart. She was a good girl. She doesn't deserve this. This is no kind of funeral. That girl was an outlaw. Outlaws don't get funerals. They get buried. You're the real deal, you know that? I haven't used the drill since 1999. Ain't I lucky? Should I gag ya? You want me to tell you how to do your job? This is your last chance, to give me the information that I want. Motherfucker, I wouldn't even give you my shoe size. Forgive me God. God, huh? Whoever the fuck is listening. How in fuck do you know anyone is? Art? Artie? He's not here. Where would he have gone? Store. Movies. Nest of goddamn rats. Every Armenian gun in Glendale, assembled on their master's lawn. We shouldn't be here. - No. - And where the fuck is Artie? He sponges up all of Robin's blood, and then dips into a fucking matinee? What's this? Is that a hole? Up. What the fuck is that? That's Artie. They got him. What do you mean they got him? Someone was in here? Yeah. Someone bad. But no worse than me, I'll wager. Where you going? Wait. Free will is a veil. What? A veil. Man moves, a train on his track. And into the station I roll. Chugga-chugga-choo. Do you know how my father died? - Your great grandfather? - I don't want to know. Save it, will ya? Let's just say, it wasn't old age. She was buried 26 years. I was worried she wouldn't function. But I greased her up good, I took her out to the desert, and she purred like a kitten. What are you doin? Giving you a chance, to keep going a little longer. And have myself a little fun before I go. Where are you going? Across the street. I recon a showdown with those gangsters outta do the trick. If I've got to eat lead, I'll do it at sunset, thank you. I've always found twilight, the most peaceful time of day. Listen to me, getting all poetic. When you hear me getting started, high tail it out the back. You still got your mask? Put it on. They haven't seen your face yet. Go easy on yourself, kid. Hey, Boe. You grinning? Put your hands up. Easy friend. Hands. Are you the one I tagged, with the mask? Turn around. Or was it your friend that I hit? Around. Okay, okay, I'll turn around, we're just chatting, yeah? Yeah. Let's chat. You and me. Okay. Okay. I was a dangerous man. More than mean, I was heartless. Pitiless. We read about Saul, watching the stoning of Saint Stephen, approving of his killing. I'm here to tell you, folks, I did more than approve. In Acts we read, about the great prophet of Damascus, Ananias. He's visited by Christ, and told to go out to the street called Straight, and visit the blinded Saul, and lay hands on him. Heel him. And Ananias says to Christ, "This piece of work is "the one you want to be heeled? "This criminal?" And how does God answer? "Don't you worry one bit. "This criminal was chosen as an instrument "to proclaim my word to the people of Israel. "Just watch and see, "how he's willing to suffer for my name." We do a prison ministry every other month, at Ironwood, in Blythe. They love your book in there. Oh well that's great to hear. Those guys need it. Every Christian inmate has got a copy. And even some of the secular ones. I tend to think, they're only reading the first half. That's got all the good parts, does it? All the action. Well it's great meeting you. Seriously thank you so much. Thanks so much. My pleasure. Thank you, God bless. Thank you, thank God. Clarence dude. - Awesome talk man. - Father Zach. Thank you so much brother. Clarence this is my really good friend, Beth Conner. Beth Conner. Well it's a pleasure to meet you. It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Deville. I really enjoyed that. That hour just flew by. It really hit home for Beth. She read your book also. I felt like I was reading about my husband. That anger, that sadness. I couldn't put it down. Hey. You home? You just get up? I didn't expect you back so early. I had to get up and hit the road early. I had to get out of that shit hole. You make the sale? Yeah we closed. We basically closed Wednesday. I mean you know how it is, I gotta go around and hold these fucking guys hand, through every little element of this thing. It's such a nightmare. I'm gettin a beer. Welcome home. I want a nap. I haven't slept all night. How long of a nap? Anyone's guess. Are you gonna be up for dinner? Sure, maybe, why? Zach's coming over. In that case, call me Rip Van Winkle. It's important you be at this dinner, Frank. Why, he's over here every week. He's practically in love with you. He's my best friend, and he's a priest. Anyway, I think he might be gay. Father Zach's gay? I don't know. I just never felt that tension with him. Interesting. And he's not the only one coming for dinner. Who else? You remember that book I tried to get you to read? About the gangster who found Jesus? What's up? How's it going, your holiness? Good, this is for you. Thank you. Oh that's nice. How was Mass? Massy. Is Frank here? He's getting dressed. Awesome. Have you had enough red wine yet today? Never. Clarence said he'll be here around seven. This is gonna be fun. I don't know if fun is the word I'd use. You're not drinking? Not tonight. Babe, you seen my nice shoes? The black ones? Yeah. Oh, hey, Father Zach. What's up, Frank. How are you? Good how are you? Good, good. Where's the uniform? It's the weekend. Priests are allowed to wear polos? You know believe it or not, I've actually own a bathing suit. Ha, have to see it to believe it. He's been over here swimming before. Hey he just kind of looks funny, without his uniform I think. I think this is normal. To me he looks weird, when he's wearing his collar and vestments. Oh well it's good to know, that no matter what I wear, someone thinks I look weird. Just buggin you, Father. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too, Frank. Thanks for having us over. Yeah, well. Beth is pumped about me meeting this gangster-dude. Please don't let that be the first thing, you bring up when he gets here. Okay? Please. It's fine Beth, I mean, he's not shy. You can talk about anything you want. I'm sure he'd be happy to discuss how far he's come. - Great should be fun. - That's what I said. Babe, shoes? Hall closet. You look handsome. Thank you for waking up. Thank you, will you pour me a glass of wine? See? Fun. When the mood sets us right. You know I'm doing my thing, and she's doing her thing. And she's looking the way that she does. Christ Father, there's no fucking thing in the world better than that. It's like heaven. Beth is very beautiful. Inside and out. And you never? What? He's here. You're a stronger man than I am, Father. Just different paths, Frank. Just different paths. Hello welcome. Oh, fuck. - What is going on? - Hey. Where'd you go? That's the guy? Yeah what why? You didn't tell me he was black. So now you're racist? How does he know us? I already told you. What are you talking about? Hiyo. Hey now. Clarence Deville. Frank Conner. You have a lovely garage, Frank Conner. Thank you. What's going on? Sprinklers. I forgot I had them on. We're in the middle of a drought. Well, Clarence, I hope you're hungry. We got a lot of food. Come on let's do this. And then I felt this warm, it was like sunlight. And it was all over my hands and, in my face and my forehead. At first it was pleasant. But then it got hot. You know like a fever. Then I looked down at my victim, and he was glowing. I mean glowing. I mean he had like the big white light on him, like on the Broadway show, and like he doing it solo. Then I looked up and the ceiling was gone. Just, blackness, space. And then I saw, the stars. I just got the chills. And there he was. Standing on top of nothing. And his eyes was full of tears. Jesus of Nazareth. Yikes. Then what happened? You realized you're naked, and the big test is the next day and you forgot to study? Frank, stop it. No it's okay. It's okay. I mean funny is funny. No but this was no dream. Everything's a dream, Clarence. Let me ask you this. The crime that you were committing, when you met your Lord and savior. What was the crime? That is not important. It isn't? No, no, it is. It's just not appropriate for the dinner table. We don't mind. It's okay Clarence. If you're uncomfortable, you really don't have to. Oh that's okay, I'm fine. As a criminal, my area of expertise, was gathering information. And I would hurt people in order to get that information. I would ask them about locations and, people, and so forth. I was the muscle. So you were beating a guy up? Was he tied down? He was. Well that's not very fair. I wasn't interested in being fair. You use your fists? Sometimes. That time. The time that you saw god, were you using your fists? No I wasn't using my fists when I saw God. What were you using? A drill. You guys just don't want to hear the list of things, that I used as weapons. How about a hammer and nails? Sometimes. This time? Yes. So there you are, crucifying this poor fuck, and you see Jesus. That really is something, Clarence. Yeah it's, quite incredible. Man. Thank you, kindly. Nice and cold. Cheers. Cheers. Your wife is some cook. Sure is. You're blessed. Yeah? Don't you know it? I don't deserve her, if that's what you mean. Well, she really loves you. How can you tell? Way she talks about you, looks at you. You're the center of that beautiful woman's world, you know that? You got a woman? No. I'm, sorry about how things went down at the table. I have this thing, I try to be the class clown. Ah that's alright brother. I got a sense of humor, and I know how I can sound totally bonkers. If you don't mind me being honest, or taking a little honesty from a stranger, I would like to confess to a few things. Sounds interesting, let's hear it. Well the thing is, I just don't get a chance to face my crimes. You know the priest and the ladies of the church, the believers? They tend to be easy on me. I just want to thank you, Frank. Pride before destruction. And boy oh boy, when I'm reminded, of all the people that I hurt. Just a couple of bad guys sitting by the pool. Do you think I should bring them a drink or something? No leave them. You've got dishes to dry, missy. You look good in front of the sink. All domestic. It's a shame. They have sinks at the rectory. I know they're like brother and sister, but, I don't like it. I can't help it. Well if you ask for my opinion, I don't think you've got anything to worry about. Yeah you're right, he's probably gay? No I meant that Zach is the real deal. He's a true priest. Yeah, but they don't cut your dick off, when you get your collar, Clarence. Drink up. Well you're not supposed to chug it. Do you believe in God? You know, I don't really think about it. My grandfather told me, free will is a veil. I don't know, maybe the old fucker was right. Maybe I do believe. Some coincidences are just a little too big. Like which ones? You two chatterboxes ready for dessert? The key for me is Job. God inflicts every sort of misfortune on Job. He takes his wife, his kids, his livelihood, his health. And still, with no explanations for his suffering, Job remains faithful. He does not curse his creator. And they tell him he's being punished. Think, what is it that you did to make God so angry? What is it, that cause so much misery. And Job insists that he did no wrong. And when God himself showed up, Job asks him, what was it? What was the point of all this misery? And God gives his famous speech: Where were you when I, made the oceans and filled them with water? The skies with stars? Where were you when I made the spider, and the birds? It's normally read as don't question God. But I take it differently. When Job asks God, why me, He didn't say, because I said so, He says something more like: look at this mess I've made, as big as you could imagine, and as small as you can imagine. And even I can't keep track. Well, young people, this old man got to get to bed. Oh, no! Really? You sure? Well I hate to break up such a good time. I really enjoyed it. You've been a fine audience, very kind, but this body isn't as resilient as it used to be, and I've got a trek back to Babylon tomorrow morning. Where are you staying tonight? A hotel. I'll drive you. Nonsense, I can go ahead and call a car. Yeah right, I'll take you. Stay here. Oh, no, thanks though. Well you're already relaxed. You can stay in the guest room? That would be totally fine, if you wanted to do that. No well, you know I got my clothes back in the room. I have yet to pack. I got to get going. We were having such a good conversation, Clarence. That's true, and I appreciate it. I definitely will be back for that barbecue. Let me make you a bag of leftovers? There is so much leftover chicken. No. No, that's okay. But I appreciate it. Okay, Well thank you again for coming. And we had so much fun, didn't we Frankie? Yeah so much fun. You sure you have to go? Man, look don't make me, stand here all night and apologize. Okay well, thank you again, for coming. It was so much fun as always. Let me take you back to the hotel. - No, I'm fine. - Come on, I don't mind. - I'll drive you back. - Well it's on my way. If he wants to take him, let him take him. There's something I want, to ask your advice about anyway, Clarence. I'll drive you back to the hotel, we can have a conversation, man to man, a little chat. What do you think? Alright. I liked what you were saying about Job, and God not knowing shit. And it fits with me, you know? I've never read a bible or nothing, but I've seen a lot of movies on Jesus. What was it that he said on the cross? Father, why have you forgotten me? Forgotten me? Forsaken. Forsaken, that's right. Poetic. Father, why have you forsaken me? Even his own son too. Yeah it is an incredible story. More than a story though, to you, I mean? You're a believer, right. I am. Excuse me. You're a sleepy believer, huh? Yeah I guess it's just old age. After eight o' clock I'm sleepy as a dog. Go ahead and rest your eyes. You've got twenty minutes til we get there. I'll wake you up when we get to the hotel. There was something you wanted to ask me? Something. No, I just felt like going for a drive. God, I must have fell asleep. You did. Are we at the hotel? No. What is this? Where are we? You know I almost thought you knew. You're just so goddamn genuine, Clarence. I almost starting laughing when I listened, to you go on about Artie and his sense of humor. Artie? Arthur Twine. The man you crucified the night you met God. I never said his name. No, you didn't. Frank, what is happening man? Where you going with this? My name's Fred. Fred Carroll. My grandfather's Boe Carroll. I don't want you to be scared. And I know it's scary just saying that, but I mean it, you have nothing to be afraid of. Open the glove box. Why? - What's in there? - Nothing to be afraid of. Just open the glove box. A gun? Your gun. Do you recognize it? Many guns look the same. The satchel. Take a look inside. Oh God. Let's just try to stay calm. My heart is pounding. Let's handle this like gentlemen. Like Christians. It kind of feels like an old samurai movie. Like a western. Two gunslingers, with a blood feud between them, and only one way to settle it. Don't do this man, I beg you. You know if it was me, you killed that night instead of Robin, she'd have shot you by the pool. The gun is loaded. Turn around. Why, what are you gonna do? Turn around. I forgive you man. I forgive you. I forgive you. Don't you hear me? I forgive you. I forgive you. Oh, hi. Hey. How was your ride? So good. Good. I love you. I love you. I'm gonna be good for you. I'm gonna be good. Oh, baby, you are good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Subtitles by explosiveskull
