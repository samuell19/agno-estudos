(Reggae tune in background) Brothers and sisters... tonight we have a brother from lslington who...um... Hey, hey, hey! You ought to turn down that sound in there. Go and make them turn down that sound system. (Shouting in background) (Needle scratches record and music stops) Anyway. Brother John here is from lslington. He writes for the Black Panther newspaper. He has been researching and checking out the scene about the inferior education they've been messing up Black children with in order to keep them suppressed and blind as to what is going on. Anyway, the brother here will be able to tell you more about it since he is the man who's been doing the research. Hey, braa. You're on. Well, in spite of Muhammad Ali... ...we are very pleased that you have come, managed to come. We're not going to change anything... Brothers and sisters, on this subject of our education and the division of the type of education they give us, into subnormal and normal schools, I'd like to start by quoting a sister who says, "The authorities should realise that by placing so many Black children in ESN schools" - educationally subnormal schools - "they're not solving the problem but creating a new one. For the children will grow up to react with hatred and violence to the further frustration by the system oftheir ability to play their full role in our society. In this society." ♪ Rock music ♪ (Music drowns conversation) (Music drowns conversation) There is a huge contradiction between the demands of Black youth today and a system, an educational policy, that is geared to producing and perpetuating a system of inequality and second-class citizenship. And this is what the sister is getting at. This is what the sister is getting at. Our generation cant tolerate schools that only prepare us to do the menial tasks in this society. Hatred and violence, bitterness and anger, will inevitably result from the system, from the frustration of our expectations and aspirations. (Murmurs of approval) Isn't that right? Thank you. Just try getting a job, try getting a job on the basis of your certificate. Try walking down town. Any street. Fleet Street. Oxford Street. Piccadilly Circus. ♪ Easy listening ♪ (Music drowns conversation) Oi, Dave. - Oh, Tone, where are you going now? - I'm going with you. You got to see your own bird home, not me. Go on. I'll see you tomorrow. - See you. - Ta-ta. - I thought we were all going together. - Together? Not when you go with David and Angie. When they go, they go alone. - Yeah. - See me home. It's only just down the road. - Where are you working, then? - Oh. Up Hammersmith. - Is it nice? - Yeah, it's all right. I didn't even know when you left the Grove, Sheila. Didn't you? Since I got that job. - You've really gone posh now, ain't you? - Posh? Well, it's better than living at home with a nagging mum. Anyway, I hated it at Ladbroke Grove. Don't you think it's crummy? Why don't you get out of there, Tony? Yeah, you're right, Sheila. It must cost a lot of money to live round here. Not if you share a flat. I've got this girlfriend who I share with. Janet. It's nice. We've got two large rooms and a kitchenette. The people are nice and pleasant. Not like Ladbroke Grove. - Got a landlady who don't bug us. - Yeah? Sounds great. Yeah, I'll show it to you when we get there. Got a new record player. We're saving up to get a telly. - You got a telly? - Course I got a telly. What do you think? It's not coloured, though. It's black-and-white! Get it? Black-and-white. - What about some chicken and chips, then? - You'll be home in a minute, Sheila. - Don't you want any, then? - Well, I'll just have chips. I'll get it. Cheers. Do you remember Frances who was always playing around with the boys? - Mm. She was a bit of all right. - Oh, Tony! She must live somewhere near 'ere. I keep seeing her and your brother together. What, my brother? My brother Colin with White bloomin' Frances? Never! My brother doesn't go out with White chicks. - Why not? - Well, he's strictly Black Power. He's always preaching to me and telling me off about my White friends. Come on, Tony! I know what your brother looks like. I'm sure it's him. Anyway, I've seen them more than once. That bastard. That sly bastard. Come on, let's make a move. I'm getting a bit cold. Ooh, guess who I saw shopping in the Edgware Road yesterday. Remember Miss Long Nose who used to teach Geography? - I pretended not to see her. - She was a right cow, she was. Once she wanted to know how comes I didn't know much about Jamaica. I reckon even now she still don't believe I was born here. - She was incredible. - Do you miss school? Yeah, it's different now, ain't it? - This is where I live. - Oh, nice place, isn't it? - It's all right. - ls that your flat at the top? Yeah. Come in. (Sheila laughs) - You! Excuse me! - Oh, Miss Hawkins, do you want me? - You, go on, out. SHEILA: What's the matter? - Go on, out! It's too late for visitors. - Too late? It's not 12:00 yet. - I've come in later than this with visitors. - Yes, well, I'm putting a stop to it. - What? I've always got friends here. - I want him out ofthis house. That's final. - What are you talking about? - Go on, you heard. I don't want any trouble. You never went on at me like this before. - It's all right, Sheila, I'll go. - What does she mean? You know very well what I mean. I'm not having that man in this house here. Do you hear me? I want you out of here or I'll call the police now. - You mean it's because he's Black, don't you? - I don't have to give my reasons to you. Why don't you say it, you bloody cow? What are you afraid of? Look, I'm not gonna stand here and be insulted by you, Sheila. - Tony! Tony, where are you going? - I'm going home, Sheila. - What for? - I don't want to get you into trouble. - Don't go. - I don't want you to get kicked out. - I won't. - I'll see you some other time, OK? All right, then. - What are you playing at? - Don't talk to me like that! - I'm not having any insults. - I pay my money! - I don't care if you have paid your money. - You have your friends here.

Drive all black thoughts from your hearts... ...and replace them with good, white, holy thoughts. For the day of the Lord shall come like a thief in the night, when you least expect it. Awake, brethren, awake. For the heavens shalt pass away with a great noise. And the elements shall melt with a burning heat. And this earth also, and all the works, all the evil, bad works, shall be burned up. But, brothers and sisters, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth... ...where righteousness will swell. And seeing that you look for such things, be careful that when he finds you... ...you are found with peace in your hearts, without a spot, and blameless. - Praise the Lord. - Praise him. King Of My Life, I Have Crowned Thee Now. ♪ King of my life, I have crowned thee now... ♪ (Chatter) I only came with you to church because your mother said she was ill and she wanted me to bring you. You sit there and sleep all morning and embarrass me. - Look, I didn't want to come in the first place. - Well, she sent you. It's not my fault. Look, God isn't going to help me, you or anyone else. - Not even my mum! - You don't have to sit in the church and sleep! You are here. You may as well do something as sit down in the church and sleep. This Black Power thing with you and Colin is causing this trouble. That's not what's wrong. It's just I don't like this church. I'm tired, right? I just want to go home and rest. Come on, let's go home. - "Go home and rest"! Won't listen to me. - It's not my fault. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the man in charge is, please? Excuse me. Sure you've come to the right place, mate? Yeah. This is where the labour exchange told me to come. Labour exchange. Yeah, well. You tell 'em from me I ain't got no jobs for people with O levels. - They bloody well know that. - But they sent me here for a clerical job. Clerical job? Look. See that office up there. That's the only office work we've got round here. Alf does the typing, Mary does the books. Fucking hell. You know how many times people come down here asking for jobs? That's the only work we've got round here. Look, there's one of your mates over there. - No clerical work, is it? - Then why did they send me here? Don't ask me, son. Look, between you and me, they knew bloody well I ain't got jobs for you. All I want is a boy to help clean up, clear this mess up. Clerical work! You don't need O levels for that. Yeah, well, sorry for wasting your time, but they sent me here. Like I said, the only work I've got here is what you've seen. You people got it easy, ain't you? You come over here, get an education. I had to leave school when I was 14, and two years' National Service - another job you people wouldn't know about. Yeah, well, thanks for telling me, mate, but it wasn't my fault. Hmm. When you get back to that labour exchange, tell them what I said. Exactly what I said. Tony! Tony! - What you doin', braa? - Go on! - Go on, braa. What you doing round here? - I've just been to see about a job. - You get it? - No, man. Didn't take it. It wasn't the son of job the labour exchange was supposed to send me for. - They want a guy to clean up. - I can't get a job. Which pan this place is? It's a metal factory just down the road. Second turn on the right. Yeah, I know it. I know a guy who work in there. After I get something to eat, I'll go in and check it out. You know, you remind me of a Jamaican fella who been livin' off de dole for three years. - Yeah? - He telling people dat he's a shepherd! Dem stupid people at de labour exchange still looking for shepherd work for him all over London. Yeah, look, we're coming up to it just now. Yeah, Mike go in front, now. And, Winston, you take the back and I'll follow up back. You better buy something in truth, right? Follow we behind. Make sure no-one be watching, man. Not too close. - What you guys up to? - Cool it here, man. We back in a minute. (Low murmur of voices) (Police radio in background) (Relieved laughter) Oh, God, man. You... You dash out there like you's Flash Gordon, man. You're a pretty good fuckin' runner. Bwoy, when I hear them fucking tin cans fall down, it is like I just grow wings, y'know. I just take off, boy. There's no looking back. But I see you take a fall, boy. Oh, raas, I nearly bust up my fuckin' leg. We sittin' down here laughin', man, and poor Jacko in trouble. He must be shitting himself in that police station, y'know. Dat no joke, man. What we gonna do about Jacko, man? Do? Chu, man, what de fuck can we do? We best just sit cool and wait to hear what happen. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Go by Colin and de boys and check out the scene, y'know. - See if we can get him bail, or something. - Yeah. Bwoy, dem police must be beating the arse off he, y'know. Bwoy, I glad I ain't there, bwoy. Hey, where Anthony? Where Anthony, man? I thought he come in here with us, man. Me thought so too. Where de fuck he gone? Tony! He'll be outside. Tony! - Where you there? - Hey, look down here, man. Hide in the corner. What is bwoy doing in de corner here with his hands on his head? Say, Anthony, are you all right? Oh, God, oh, God! The police! The police! They're coming! They're coming! Nah, man, they ain't gon' come here, man. It's all right, man. De only way dem fucking police can find we here is if Jacko tell them where we living. Nah, man, he ain't gon' do that. He ain't gon' talk. Are you sure? Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know him, man. He cool, man. He cool. Come, now, man. Where is this place? Are we still in the Grove? What you mean if we still in the Grove? We are in the Grove, braa. This is home. This is where we live. - Yeah, but what happened, man? - What you mean, what fuckin' happened? - You mess up the whole scene. - What scene? I didn't even know what was going on. Listen, man, you were supposed to wait outside, right, and cool it. But then you come in and mess up the scene by pullin' down them fucking cans. But I didn't know what was going on. No-one told me anything. - What did you think we went in there to do? - I don't know! Don't play fucking stupid. You know we went in there to tief. No, mate, I didn't. I was outside and I just got fed up. I went to look for you guys. It was an accident, I tell you. I just pulled one can and they all fell. And, man, I just got scared and started to run when I saw you guys running. - It was an accident. - You fuckin' lying, Tony, man. - You couldn't be that stupid. - Look, I didn't know what you were up to. Don't pull me into this, right? Well, you know now, right? (Thumping on stairs) Oh, shit, Joe, man, you could've rap or something, man. You nearly scared we guys to death down here, man. You thought I was the fuzz? Out in the west it's hard to tell. Hey, listen, I just got the message that you guys was on the scene. And the coppers grabbed Jacko and they're checking out this area. Shit, bwoy. I wonder if Jacko talk. Nah, man. No, Jacko is no talker. Joe. Joe, listen. What about Jacko's parents? Has anybody told them? Maybe they can try and help Jacko. What? Help him do what? You don't know Jacko's mother and father. You mean, they'll just let him go to prison? What you think we doin' down in this hole? It's cos all we mother and father the same. They just scared, and obey all the White man rules. Listen, Tony, man, right? A lot of dem believe, right, when they get in trouble wi' de police, right, dem think you bad, right, y'know? And sometimes police might come to your doorstep and say, "Well, listen. We have your son down in the station there. And he need bail," or something. You know what they tell him? They say, "Well, make him stay." They don't waan know you, they don't waan talk to you. I think my parents is more understanding than that. Well, you lucky, braa. But I mean, a lot of parents, like mine - or any of we here - can't realise that one of us get pick up on the street every day wrongfully. Especially Black people, who are already under all that pressure. I keep telling you, man. That's why we all leave home. Or get kick out of home. You know the first thing they come with when you get pick up by the police? You are not workin'. You're not workin'. And then they can't see that the whole White working system is a load of cock-up. Hey, look at you. Man, Tony, big O levels. And still you go and tief and the police look for you all over the place. Look, you get this straight. I didn't steal anything, right? Understand? I didn't steal anything. Yeah? Then it's a chance you guys take in stayin' here, so you better split. Yeah, you're right. Let we take off, man. Chu! Hey, Joe, you better go first, man. Yeah, all right. Coming, Tony? (Jet plane passes overhead) Hey, it's all right. Come on. So, Tony, what you gon' do now? You coming with us or you goin' home? - Where we going? - Up by the adventure playground. There is safe, y'know. When Babylon find we there, at least we have an alibi. Man, let him go, man. He have a safe home to go to. All we got is that hole up the road. And right now that hot. Let him go, man. You must be really hungry, braa. You eating Black-man food now? And with pepper sauce to boot! Hungry, braa? To raid the people's supermarket in the middle of the day! It's only a waste of time doing that. If you want to tief, team how to tief constructively, and for the struggle. Ah, it's all good and well to steal for Black Power, isn't it? But when you're starving and hungry and you've got no money, what do you do then? You're starving, are you? You know it's Mike and Jacko, Winston and them guys I'm talking about. I don't see Black Power helping them, mate. You don't see Black Power helping them, eh? That's why I just come from the pigs' house trying to get Jacko out. (Colin sucks his teeth) Chu! I'm trying to get a lawyer to go down and arrange some kind of bail. That's what Black Power is all about. Something constructive. Not going around tiefing tins of corned beef. Look, man, I know all about that scene. But that's not where it's at. The only way to beat this thing is to organise ourselves and work together in a collective sense. You keep going around looking for jobs all the time. You know damn well in the long run, you'll have to take any shit they offer you, if it's jobs you're looking for in this White man's country. You don't like White men but you like White women. What? - What's that? - Nothing. Nothing. Anyway... Look, your mother left an address here for you for some porter work in a hospital. Braa, you can either take that job and become a porter, and clean up all them White people's shit... ...or you could come up and help Louise and the brothers. Right now we're organising a meeting to raise some money for a dance. To do, one: to help the brothers and sisters who are in trouble with the law and need legal assistance. And two: we want to bring out a better newspaper. To spread the consciousness. To give out more information. To areas where Black people don't know what's happening. That's good and well, Colin, but what's gonna happen about Mike and Winston? You know what I mean. With the police and what happened today. Stop trying to kid me, Tony. You mean what's gonna happen to you. Well, if you put it that way. You don't have to worry, braa. And anyway, they don't know what they look like. To the White man, every Black man look the same. And that would mean some other poor brother's getting arrested for what all you done. It happens all the time, y'know. All the time. Anyway, Tony, what you gonna do? I think I'll check out this hospital job. That's cool, braa. You check out your hospital job. And if you feel like being educated, you could come to the benefit next week, and dig it. Can I have the key, guv? Cheers, mate. We cannot depend on White people for our education any more. What we need here in Ladbroke Grove, brothers and sisters, is to open our own nurseries and our own supplementary schools, whereby we can give our children the necessary help they need. MAN: Right on, brother. We need more Black symbols, Black dolls and Black balls... ...and Black pictures and Black stories. And plays written about great Black men and women. So that our children can have that sense of identity, pride and belonging. Pride and self-reliance are de best armour we have against the prejudice and humiliating experiences that will certainly face us in de English schools and in de White society. In other words, we are trapped. We are trapped! - (Cheering) - Hold on, brothers and sisters! Hold on! Hold on. Hold on. What I would like to say to you, or the way I would like to sum up what I've been saying to you, is the way how Brother Basil puts it in his poetry. He says, "Poor people, starving people, naked people, Black, downtrodden people, suffering people, the axe of justice is at the root of the tree. Come forth, come forth, my people. Let every voice be heard so loud that it cannot be ignored. Strike back! Strike back, my people! Let every blow insist on freedom." Thank you. (Cheering) All right! All right! All right, sisters and brothers. All you keep all your seats. I know all you want to get into all your reggae and do all your thing. But you got to listen to sister Louise, who is here with a very positive message, which concerns us, and by the way, the sister also lived in the States for some time and knows the scene there too, and anywhere else Black people are under pressure from these pigs. Brothers and sisters... - Sister Louise. - (Cheering) Thank you, brother Colin. Brothers and sisters. As brother Colin said, we are all anxious to get down... ...to groove with the music. Cos after all... ...music... ...is one of the most important parts of the Black man's heritage. So I'm gonna try to keep my rap as brief and as short as possible. Since most of the evening has been politicking and discussing a movement for survival... ...our struggles... ...l would just like to take up where brother Colin's left off. And that is to remind you that the economical suppressed, the economical deprived - that's you and me - ...in this country, and many other countries... ...have no time- and I repeat, no time - to play political parlour games because the lives of our children are at stake. (Cheering) Some ofthe so-called economical elite, and we all know who they are, we can all point the doom finger at them... - Yes. - That's true. ...they can afford to speak softly, they can afford to tread lightly... ...they can afford to employ the soft sell... ...because they own the society, or they think they own the society, but will they always own the society? Brothers and sisters, and I mean all brothers and sisters, we, as Black people... ...cannot afford to adapt to the methods, to their methods, to relieve our oppressions. Brothers and sisters, we must organise ourselves politically to deal with our own situation because the governments ofthe world is not going to help us. What I am saying... is that in order to deal with the police or any other organised force of suppression, we must unite our experiences of brutality, not only with the police, but I repeat, brutality in housing, brutality in education, in all areas of our social lives. Brothers and sisters, it is far better... ...to speak truthfully and forcefully, because only when one's true self, be he White or Black, is exposed, can the society proceed to deal with the problems from a position of clarity and not one of misunderstanding. We must demand of each other to rise... Right on! ...and walk proud. To help one another, to join forces with all brothers and sisters throughout the world, who are suppressed, who are constantly reminded to be kept in their places. We must demand an end of racist education. We must demand an end of racist housing. We must demand bread, peace, dignity, and social justice for all men, be he White or be he Black.

(Shouting) (Music stops abruptly) (Shouting increases) What is all this raid about? What are you raiding the place for? We have a legal right to be here. Look, what you searching me for? You got a warrant? Shut your mouth and keep your hands on the wall! - Are you searching for drugs? - Shut your mouth. Where is your warrant? That is the law! Where is your warrant? - The law isn't concerned with you and your lot. - What did you say? I said, the law is not concerned with you and your lot! - I heard what you said. How dare you? - Get her out of here! Let me go! (Louise continues shouting) Listen! Get that dog. - Let the dog go. - Everything seems under control, sir. Let the bloody dog go, man. He's here to smell out drugs, not attack people. I'll speak to you later. (Dogs bark) Leave me alone, you fucking pigs! Leave me alone! Leave her alone, you pigs! - Let me go! - Leave me! (Shouting) (Crash) (Police radio in background) (Sirens wail) I told you already, Tony. You don't have to tell them anything. Don't let them con you into saying anything. We want to phone de lawyer. Look, Tony, don't believe dem pigs. Because all dem want to do is frame we up and pack we with drugs. Why don't you let the bwoy go and question me without dat crap, instead of trying to make him freak out with all that pig shit, huh? Take him out of here and cool him down. Let me go, man! Let me go! Let me go! COLIN: Let me go! (Colin screams) Come on, now, you don't have to be afraid. And you don't have to lie to us. We know all about your brother and the other Black Power boys around here. And we know that you're not one of them. (Toilet flushes and Colin splutters) Don't listen to your brother. He's a well-known troublemaker in this area and he'll only get you into trouble, too. Just answer the questions and then we'll let you go. But I told you already, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Come on, Tony, you look like an honest boy. You don't want to get mixed up in all this, do you? We know that Colin doesn't live at home with you and your parents, right? But he comes and goes frequently. You must've seen him with the stuff some time. You must know where he hides it in the house. Come on, Tony. We don't want to lock you up. I told you already, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I don't know where he hid any stuff. What stuff are you talking about anyway? Look, lad, you know bloody well what we're talking about. Drugs. You must've seen him with a parcel or a box or a package. I mean, he must keep some of his things around the house somewhere. Hmm? About the house. Or... - In your father's shop? - (Thuds and Colin groaning) (Punches and groaning) Well... Well, he keeps some of his things at home. Like clothes, but... I never seen him with any stuff. I haven't. I'm letting you go, Tony. But only because I know that you're different from the rest of them. You're a good lad. You better go home and keep out of trouble, hmm? Keep away from those Black Power troublemakers. What's the matter, Dad? What happened? What do you mean, what happened? You should know what happened. The blasted police bust in here and turned the place upside down, looking for drugs. They say you and your brother have drugs hide here. Look at the place. Look at this place. Look what they do. Nearly frightened your mother to death. What more trouble all you go and get into with the police? Oh, God, Anthony! Ma, we didn't do anything. We were at the benefit dance, Pa. They just burst in, beat up people, arrested people. I and Colin was arrested and taken to the station. We didn't have any drugs. Nobody had any drugs. They still got Colin locked up at the station. We didn't have any drugs, Pa. - We didn't have any drugs. - Well, that's what they say. They say all you had drugs hide here. That's why they bust up the place. Oh, God, Anthony! How you could do dis to your father and me? We didn't do anything, Ma. The sly White bastards. They let me go feeling everything was all right and this is what they do behind our backs. How could they, Pa? How could they? How could they? They done it! These people are vicious, boy. They are vicious. Oh, you shame we! Oh, you disgrace we! Oh, you bring de police to break up de house! How all you can go get in trouble with the police? What you do, bwoy? All de neighbours was standing in de street, watching de police rip de place apart, as though we were some common criminals. Look, Ma, we didn't do anything! You know, Ma, you don't have to do anything to be arrested by the police when you're Black. Anthony, me and your father live in this country for years, and we never had anything wid de police. Never. We work hard and we mind we own business. Oh, you must respect de White people laws. Dey know best! Dey own de place. Dey is de lords and masters! Dey have all de bombs, all de guns, all de police force. We is only poor Black people, who have to work hard and hope dey accept we and leave we alone. Oh, God! Oh, God! Why is de Lord punishing me? I don't deserve dis. What have I done wrong? Where did I go wrong? What is my sin, oh, Lord? Look, Ma, you're always going on about this God business. You haven't done anything wrong. God is a White man. It's a White man who's done this to us, Ma. Look, they're not the only people in the world. They ain't no fucking lords and masters. We are human, too! Black people are fucking human beings, too, Ma! Look, we don't have to keep on bowing and kissing their arses. We don't have to, Ma! We don't have to. Anthony! Don't talk to your mother like that. You don't have to disrespect her. To hell with that, Dad! To hell with the bleeding respect. That's all we learn to do, to respect. And where's that gotten us? That's gotten us nowhere, Dad. Look what they've done to the place. Have they got any respect for us? Have they? He blaspheming! He talking just like Colin! It's dis Black Power business dat getting Black people in all dis trouble. You mean this is what's making Black people wake up, Ma. Ma, look, you've got to give up this bloody White-god business, and believing the White man is some kind of a... Look. This is what they do to us! They make us feel inferior. You have to cover up your hair with this piece of shit just to be like them. Get out of here! Get out of here! L don't want you in here. Get out of me house. MA: I disown you. I disown you. You standing up there being disgraceful and rude to me, your own mother? Get out! Get out! (She sobs) Bopsie, listen to me. Everything that boy tell you here tonight is true. He make me feel shame because this is something I should have told you long ago. Oh, God! You too? All that shit you've been talking alt these years. All the time and money spent and years wasted with you and that kiss-me-arse dream. You don't know what you want to be. In Trinidad, you used to come on with all that middle-class shit. No, it wasn't good enough-We had to come to England to be Whiter than everyone else- And all the time you knew I didn't want to come to England. I didn't want to leave Trinidad. Bopsie, Bopsie, you don't know what you've done to we with your blasted selfishness... and your White dream. Look at me. Look at me today. I'm nothing. Nothing! From an accountant in Trinidad to a kiss-me-arse labourer for 16 years in this country. And what about you? You been scrubbing and charring for the people all these years. And you still doing it. Look at we! Look at we! What we come to? Look. Oh, God, Marlene, dis is all de meat you can give a man? Look, man, you know you gon' get me vexed. People waiting for something to eat. Wh'appen? You always organise yourself to dish out this grub where you always end up having more food than anybody else. What's wrong with you? Listen, no pepper sauce today? If you want pepper sauce, go outside and get it yourself. You think I's your mother or something? Pshh... Oh, God, sir. These people, them evil. - Unno. Unno, man, want to read this news? - Like you do. Jesus Christ. Hey, brother, hear this, man. Hear them, hear them. "Six policemen get brutally beaten up in demonstration last night in Ladbroke Grove Black Power demonstration." What kind of demonstration? "And three are seriously injured in a hospital." What a bunch of pussy-claat liars, huh? So wh'appen to all dem Black people dem lick up on bust-ups, huh? Jesus Christ. Unno brother was round there last night. He say dem sisters dem take, dem lash up and beat up Marlene and Louise. Bust up de sister and de dog... de police dog bite up de sister hard. And Louise get her head bust up. De man sit down here and say, "What? Three policemen get injured, sir?" Brother, man, I don't wanna sound like a liar but I'm gon' tell you de truth, y'know. About 60 Black people get dem head bust up and mash up and lick up and stab up last night. I tell you de truth. Unno dig dem Fleet Street boys? You still digging Fleet Street boys? You want to dig the police strategy. Listen, man. They raid this place here last night, right? They beat up and damage up a whole heap of people. Right? And then listen to this now. All them people who they beat up and damage up and injure up, you notice dat they ain't even take them down to the station or even call an ambulance for any one ofthem? You dig it, hmm? Of all of them who they come to arrest, they just arrest them without any evidence of injury, you dig that? Huh? You digit? - You dig the scene? MARLENE: Nice, Junior, nice, you come hard. t got to give you more meat than them others. You know, Junior, you're right. I never thought of it last night. But looking back on it, that's exactly what they did. English boy, you have a lot to learn. Teach him, Junior. Teach him. - Thank you, sister. Nice. - Louise! You come down? You feeling all right? Yeah, honey. Yeah... I'm feeling kinda...all right. - You want something to eat? - No. I'm not eating. Marlene? Could you get me a cup of black coffee? I just wanna sit down here and look at the news and see what these people have to say. Oh... Marlene? Don't forget to leave some food for the brothers and sisters who are coming to help. I want everything organised by tonight. I want no hang-ups tomorrow. MARLENE: OK, I'll fix it. It's OK, Louise. Hey, sister. How is the head? Oh, God, you're looking sexy with that plaster on your head. Don't mind my head, braa. You just keep on making those placards. JUNIOR: You're right, y'know. All day you sit down there. You mean to tell me that there's only two placards you make? Yes, but you as soon as you feed me, I'll work faster. MARLENE: I not forget he. JUNIOR; Hey! English boy. Put the tallest pole you can find on that one. And make sure it stick. Hey, Junior. Are you sure you want me to put the highest pole on this one? How you mean? The higher, the better. But do you mean this, Junior? Do you really mean what you wrote here? Well, read it, now. Read it loud and clear so that everybody could hear. I ain't see nothing wrong with it. Read it now! No, what I mean is all this, "bloody, bloody" and "death to all White people". It's what we want. Isn't that what we want? We want to kill all of them, raas! No, man, I don't agree. I can't agree with this. How do you mean, you can't agree? What goin' on here? Like you on their side? Look, Junior, I don't have to be on their side to disagree with this. I mean, I just can't believe that all White people are bad. I just can't. Oh, yeah? So why you can't believe that, braa? What is going on with this guy? You must have fall on de head, bwoy. The pigs, they have your brother, they beat him up and lock him up in some dirty cell, huh? They beat up your mother, smash up your house, and do everything. And you can sit down here and tell me how White people good? Look, chu, man. Look, go away, man. So how about the 500 years of sufferings and slavery that Black people been going through all over the world? Look, Junior, you don't have to tell me about that. I know. I'm part of it, but I still don't feel that way. I mean, I've got White friends, right? And they're good friends to me. And I've known lots of other White people who are good to me. - I can't agree with this. - Then you must be a lucky one, boy. Because I don't know not one good White person in all my life. All of dem evil. Dem is like the devil. Dem is devil people to raas. Look, Junior, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that the White people, for some strange reason or other, don't realise that they're in the same position like us. - Chu, man! You must be joking. - No, I'm not joking. If you look at it this way, who has all the power? - White people. - Right. Who runs the country? - White people. - Right. - Who has the police stations and the armies? - White people. - Who has all the jobs? - White people. Right. Who runs the schools and the education system? - White people. - Right. Just a handful of people. Just a handful of people has all this power. And you know what, they do it. Chu, Junior! The brother right, man. The brother talking good. English brother or not, he talking good. Because what he's actually saying is that White people in this country has been colonialised and enslaved in this country. Just like we! The only difference with dem and us is that... is that we can see the bars and de chains, but they can't. So that's their hang-up. Raas! So is this what you're all about, braa? Anyway, I think what you could be saying there is true. But I have to think about this English brother over here. Because he got a lot to learn about dis black-and-white scene. And as for me, I don't know where he's at. Because the guy born over here, and as far as I'm concerned, y'know, he on a completely different trip from all of we.

When things start getting rough, you got somewhere to go back to. - You too! - Me? You've got the dream to fall back on of sun, sea and palm trees. What have I got? Office blocks. Right? So I've got to stay here and survive. You know, fight to survive. (TV news in background) - Take a draw, brother. - No, thank you, brother. I don't smoke. It's all right, man. It's all right. Just take a hard draw and let it soak in. And you'll be all right, braa. Nice. Nice.

The police had gone to the rally, a benefit meeting for the Black Power group, after a tip-off concerning drugs.

Lies, all fucking lies. Turn that thing off. NEWSREADER: It was likely that charges would be made today. MARLENE: These people never tell the truth about us on television and in the newspaper. And yet all of you sit down there to watch dat? Oh! We have to have some kind of hope that one day they will tell the truth. - Chu, man! Let's dig some sounds. LOUISE: Hmm! What's that I smelt? Sure smells good. You got a...hit for sister Louise? I said, you got a hit for sister Louise? Raas claat, man! What the fuck do you think you're doing?

Shuda known better than dat.
