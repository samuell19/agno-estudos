mysterious music ... Barking Martial Music ... ... - Release the dogs! Barkings ... -It was a long time ago. Adelaide and Norbert Château-Têtard, accompanied by Raoul, their servant... -Raoul ! -...went on an innocent walk with friends. - A wild boar with its young! Deafening gunshots ... -Eight yellow vests, zero boar. There, a pheasant! -I make it my business. Fire Cris -Adélaïde Château-Têtard, who hated walking, changed from horse to wheelchair. Let's find her 20 years later. Intriguing music ... -This is Adélaïde Château-Têtard. The little whore came out. This time, I think we've got it. -The scene we have just seen cannot be understood without knowing the beginning of this story. Let's do a little jump in time for that. It was last August, in this kind of upscale neighborhood. Yes, this is where our story begins . It could be in this particular mansion, or this one, or that one. Never mind, opaque grids make these residences identical to us. Sometimes an Amazon delivery person rings the doorbell. It is the only intrusion of those who are not of the seraglio. Well, maybe not the only one. Ah, I forgot, we are in the middle of a taxi strike. So much for the surface. Now let's go underground. Let's take someone at random. We could linger on this young woman. But let's focus instead on this one. Ava. Hello Ava. -Hello. -Come on, good luck, Ava. catchy song ... -I work in the house, I forgot my proof. -I will speak to the Queen of England. Are you paying the fine now? - Check if you want. I have my beep. - Cash, credit card? We also have contactless. That's it, done, thank you. -Hello. -Sorry for earlier, you had to insist. With contactless, it goes directly to the headquarters. The rules are the rules. You need a ticket. Otherwise I make a file for the union. It's all in good fun, it's to know who we're dealing with. Can I write in front of your first name "naive"? Upbeat music ... -Paul was a good boy. Without an ounce of malice. - There is no taxi! -He had resisted all the heiresses that his mother had presented to him for twenty years. ... -Please ? The counter is... How do I get on the plane? I'm going to Antibes. -Antibes... -Yes, mom is over there with Raoul and the dog. My plane takes off in 40 minutes, what do I do? -Take a taxi or an Uber. - There is a strike, the ring road is blocked. We are still being held hostage. I would like a ticket. How much does it cost ? - You don't often take the metro. -It's the first time, I hope I don't get mugged. -There is a beginning for everything. I'm selling you a ticket, but you'll never get your plane. Here, already a plan. - Can't you go through the door? -There is a camera to fire me if I break the rules. Hold. Oh no ! - I'm calling mom. - Is she a locksmith? -Hello, mom, I missed the plane. There are more taxis in Paris. I don't even know how to take the metro. Well tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. May I invite you to accompany me? -Where ? -Let's go to Bagatelle, it's right next door. It's not very original, but I have little imagination. -Ava had been working here for 8 days . She felt like she had been there for years. Ava, who saw herself as a future unemployed Parisian transport worker, opted for the stroke of madness and a life full of adventures. Ava decided to be free. Thus, Madame Château-Têtard, Raoul and the Rolls waited in vain for Paul's arrival at the villa in Antibes. -What is he making? -He may have met a girl from the neighborhood. - Why not the Queen of England? Don't say anything, Conchita. Raoul ! The Rolls ! We go back to Paris. - Let's have a sorbet. With a good tip, I entrust him with my suitcase. -It's too much for an ice cream. - Keep the change. - Nope. You rich people, I know you. You're going to ask me to keep your suitcase for 100 euros. Tomorrow, we will have to watch the brat on the swing. Your 100 euros, I do not want it. -Rest assured, I won't ask you anything. It's not a gift, it's a gift. - Do you like romance? The storm roars. -I admit that I never asked myself the question. -You know how to swim ? It's raining cats and dogs. -What do your parents do? - I have no parents. I grew up in the Public Welfare. - Yes, of course, I see. This social assistance established by the welfare state. The storm roars. Come dry off at home. Mademoiselle. Please come up. Let yourself be guided. mysterious music ... I will be back. ... A phone rings. ... ... -You don't pick up? - No, it's mom. Not at all ! It's mom's chair. - Do you live with your mother? -Yes finally... Mom needs help, she's in a wheelchair. Hence the elevator. We share the mansion since dad died. The ground floor belongs to mum, I am upstairs. We have the entrance and the dining room in common. So we can discuss at the table. The thunder resounds. Can I get you a drink? - Uh... yes, if you want. My father died 15 years ago, he was an inventor. -He's going on a trip? -No, he poses with his invention. He invented... What do you think can make a piano move? For example. -Music. - Oh no! Do not. No, wheels. My father invented this. The suitcase on wheels. Before being in the horizontal movement, we climbed the social ladder thanks to the elevators. Grandpa made his fortune in elevators. The elevators of the Eiffel Tower are Château-Têtard. Everything is here. -Ah, yes, the Eiffel Tower. -Grandpa was an inventor, as Great-grandfather who invented revolving doors. Grandpa got rich during the war by selling its elevators to the right people. Nothing illegal about that, given the laws then in force. - Oh, Chile! -That's what we've done best. A feat that dad took care of. When General Pinochet was detained in England by a Spanish judge, we were asked to equip his villas and the presidential palaces with wheelchair lifts . In 5 days. And we succeeded! Dad's stroke of genius has been to offer used equipment who looked like they had been there for 10 years. We sold used equipment more expensive than new Knowingly. Nothing illegal about that. When the inspectors of the international tribunal went to his house, the elevators proved his health. The general was indeed the bedridden man he said he was. He could not be judged. He returned to Chile on his plane on his wheelchair. He rolled them well. It gave us publicity. We then uninstalled everything. The elevator downstairs belonged to the general. Realize. - But, the general, was he a dictator? - That 's not what everyone says. There is a dictator and... This kind of regime is never totally bad for trading. These people are for freedom of enterprise. You heard me right. Freedom. The storm roars. Aren't you hot? Upbeat music ... - By the way, my name is Ava. - Pleased, my name is Paul. I would like to marry you. - Oh, good idea! - You don't want me to be happy? -Do you think I wanted to marry your father? We must marry each other. These rallies were useless. Your swimming pool subscription, 5000 euros per year. It's expensive to finish with the metro. I should have given them to Conchita. So to speak, Conchita. -It's not hard to hear. Bring happiness into the house. -Someone in Rolls is getting married to someone in the subway. Who do you think wins? -Everyone ! The owner of the Rolls gets what he never could buy. Love! I want Ava. -My son... I think you've lost your mind. - The wedding had taken place. Apart from Notre-Dame which had burned down, nothing had stood in the way of the ceremony. Even the priest had not put his veto, lest Paul go and worship elsewhere. Ava's happy days began with Paul's, and the opening of a bank account, that is to say freedom. It was the perfect love. But quickly, Paul no longer accompanied Ava on her outings. Then, he no longer waited for her when she returned from shopping. gaining independence, Ava had the brilliant idea of ​​dusting off the residence of the Château-Têtards. -My dear child, If you had spoken to the maid about it, you would know that nothing is being moved. Your pranks made us spend money. Understand, my child, here, the furniture is motionless. Conchita and I don't like working for nothing. Conchita tires quickly. Don't forget to tip her, she needs it. -I was thinking... - You thought wrong. - It's beautiful, Paris. -It depends on the neighborhoods, madam. Know that, Adelaide, your mother-in-law, has priority for the Rolls. -Yes yes. Upbeat music ... Why are you closing? ... - Not, Ava. Pinochet is not allowed to you. You are not in a wheelchair. Give me that. Give me that! Put that on there. This will prevent it from being knocked over if you trip over your stilts. Turn it on since it amuses you so much. Voilà ! The dog ! Raul! Let's go. - Yes. -It was 18 months since Ava became Mrs Château-Têtard, and that she shared her life between her husband, outings in Rolls, Raoul, and the one she had quickly called the "Queen Mother". Ava saw her life turn into a routine. One evening, an extraordinary event happened. The Wedding March (Felix Mendelssohn) -They did it ! Laughter ... No need to skew anymore, huh. We're going to enforce the president's policy. Let's make some trickle. We will spend all the money saved on taxes. Ava... - Hello. -I present to you the "Smooth and Go". The silver medal of the Lépine competition. sit. Stand. Sit. Bark Stand. Sit. -Okay okay. -Walk. Bark The dog barks. Stop. Turn. Turn. - Pilot mom if you want. -Certainly not. Raoul, take the controls. Faster, I'm not bedridden. -Be careful. But beware ! -Leave me. I am a professional driver! -It's going too fast ! It's going too fast ! panicked cries Help. -The extraordinary event of the day before was irrelevant in Ava's life. The runoff had its gutters. She expected more. That's why, that day, she went on an adventure. Intriguing music ... Ava loved the end of summer. She was enjoying the sunny days and already fresh in September to pass time. Occasionally a man met Ava's gaze. And the latter was denied on the spot. She wanted to enjoy the sun, do nothing and feel alive. -It's pretty, these flowers. Would you like flowers with your salad? Laughter Ava, do you know the game of exquisite corpses? -Non. -It is very simple. Someone starts a sentence and another finishes it. Listen. "Conchita hadn't dusted so..." Paul? - Yes, ma'am. -It's a game, Conchita. "Conchita hadn't dusted so..." -"so... "we sneezed all day." -It sometimes gives quite funny sentences. Come on, let's get started. "As the meal was served and I wanted..." Over to you, Ava. - "...that we were going..." - No! "...that we were going..." Imperfect subjunctive! Example: "After each meal, he wanted "fold your napkin." You lost, Ava. Are you doing everything it takes to have a child? Are you doing everything it takes to have a child? -Is it the game that resumes? - No, don't be a child. Or if, when are you going to do it, this child? -Mom, these are not things to be asked at the table. - We can't talk anymore. Each time it degenerates. Mom, the incident is closed. -The weather's nice. -What a strange sentence. - Apparently, my subjects cause incidents. So I'm talking about rain and shine. The weather's nice. Ava, what did you do today, in this beautiful weather? - Oh, not much. Laughter -Since when do we laugh at the table? Intriguing music ... She clicks her tongue. ... ... Your wife had a very sparkling look when I asked her what she had done. What did you do today ? Not much. No. Not much. Or rather... Not much. -I didn't notice that tone at all. -I noticed that today she went beyond the boulevard Flandrin. According to his purchases. And it's been several times. I wonder what she finds going elsewhere? - This daughter-in-law, you wanted her so much. -The Queen Mother displayed her nuisance abilities. She was talking about putting her under curatorship or worse. She was determined to harm him. - We must have her committed, doctor. Across the entire medical spectrum. -Anyway, it's nobody. -What do you mean ? -She has no family. It will take a DNA test. -A DNA test? To do what ? -Imagine... if she has the poverty genes. -Oui... What makes you say that ? -If the poor do not make it over several generations, it's not for nothing. We are rich from father to son, it means something. Examine it, and you tell me. -And medical secrecy? -Ava was far from thinking of all the pitfalls that were brewing. Besides, she didn't think, she was enjoying the moment. That's what she loved, in this new life, a present full of surprises. romantic music ... -Health. You know, that was the rule. You know what I mean ? The rules are the rules. I had to, it was the rules. A door closes. -Here she comes back. Paul, you are really happy with this Ava? -I never asked myself the question. I'm not unhappy. Good walk ? - Very good. Coughing - It's 2 to 8, ma'am. -Perfect, we are going to sit down to eat. In 2 minutes. Ava, my child, tell me... When you go up, at least you don't use Pinochet ? -The Pinochet? -The elevator. - No, you asked me not to. - That's it, have fun, my little one. Intriguing music ... -What do you want ? What do you want ? -Sir ? Yes you. Approach. Hello, my name is Ava. And you? -Jérô ... -Jerome. -Jerome, would you like an ice cream? We can say you. Really? My husband is so well brought up that I miss him. The days are alike. He often tells me: "Routine makes you feel like you live longer." What do you think ? Finally, you? In life, I do nothing, I walk around. You, what are you doing? -Things and others. I finished my studies. And here I am looking for work. -I experienced this a few years ago. Won't you eat your ice cream? (In English) ... -You're welcome. -Stupid froggies... -Damned English! - They drive upside down. - Navigation is not their thing. ... ... shouts ... Shouts Laughter ... -Bye-bye ! ... -We kiss ? -Like that, there? -Oui. Upbeat music ... ... -There they are ... -They left. - We got them, huh? Nageons. Clothes should be dry. With this heat, we'll soon be dry, too. - Could we meet again? - Is that really a good idea? -Oui. Tomorrow, at the Lutetia, for example. -In the hotel ? -Ah yes, the hotel... Ah yes of course. I was thinking more of the restaurant, but... -This slight flirtation was enough to annoy Ava. Besides, she hadn't thought further than this inconsequential love affair. But this horizon contained in the exclamation "in the hotel" put a nasty bug in his ear which opened up an unimagined horizon. An antidote to her neurasthenia as a rich young woman who had nothing in his life. -I'm going to get the clothes. We've been robbed of our belongings! - You're sure ? - Yeah, it's good. - Ouch! Ouch! Jerome... What are you doing ? I found our clothes thieves, I'm going to find them. -How's it progressing? - Don't worry, I did karate. It's mine. ... Blows and screams -Ah, there you go. Jean-Denis! We found her. Screams and blows -Please ? Do you know where the orchestra is? - They are at a private concert. - You are not the violinist? - Oh no, I'm the violist. It has nothing to do, it is much more difficult than the violin. I'm waiting for the singer. I've never seen him, I hope he will know how to recognize me. It's not you, by any chance? - Dear Adelaide. - Dear Eloise. -Life is beautiful ? -No, she's ugly, and even more so when the weather is nice. Laughter - And this daughter-in-law? Your social profiteer... Still no heir? -My God, I make life hard for him. It's fun, it'll teach her not to get pregnant. Laughter Where did this singer go? -Who are you ? -It's me. - Where are we ? - Too long. -What are you doing there ? -Who are you ? - I'm the singer. -It's you ! We've been looking for you everywhere. Thank you, my friends, thank you. We found our latecomer upstairs. We will open our concert with an extract from La Vie parisienne by Jacques Offenbach. The famous tune of the French cancan. Audience disappointment I was only fooling. Laughter We will interpret you some Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Romances without words, to which we will add a song. Applause Romances without words (Felix Mendelssohn) ... We knock inside the case. ... - At least we have something serious. -And d'intelligent. Screams and crashes Brouhaha ... -I'm here ! I'm here. What happened ? Look, in the instrument! A naked woman! Did you see her like me? My stepdaughter, Ava, was completely naked! I'm not crazy, I saw it. She was completely naked. And the piano rushes at me, can you believe it? -Yes Madam. - Enclosed under the lid. That's not the most amazing thing. Ava ? What did you do today ? -I walked. -Oh yes ? And where? We would have seen you at the concert. Isn't it, Conchita? - Yes Madam. - Finally, mom, Ava was out for a walk. Isn't it, darling? -I saw her come out naked from the case of a double bass. Laughter -I thought you were in a piano? Mom, are you kidding us? Laughter It's normal to have a hallucination after taking a piano in the face. -It's not a hallucination, I saw it! - I'll take you. - Useless. Raoul will take care of it. Raul! -It's worrying, I'm worried about his head. - Do we have her committed to see if she manages? We can bring in Dr. Anigo. -It may be a way to claim attention, right? - Me too, I need attention. -It's a funny evening ahead! Luckily the servants are in bed. -My back... It doesn't work out. video game music ... Barking ... -Raoul ! Whose are these black dogs? -One of our guests took them for a walk. -Ava ? What did you do today ? Gunshot She screams. - Mrs... - Thank you, Conchita. You pulled me out of a nightmare. -Put that on the bedroom, I come to pay you. -Are you coming out tonight? - No, we never go out in this house. Paul plays on his mobile, the Queen Mother unravels sweaters and Raoul makes successes. Besides, he doesn't just play cards. Especially with Madame, but I'll tell you about it another time. - And tomorrow, what are you doing? -We meet again ? I don't want to be bored anymore. Jerome, I still want. A clock chimes. -I have to go to Dalac, at the agency. -At the agency ? - Yes, the agency... The employment agency. -If for Ava the thing was simple, she had a lover, for Jérôme, it was a complex problem. Jerome wondered what trouble he was getting into. After all, he would be making up a lie. It is very practical as an exit door. But this door does not always lead to the exit. So, we create another door. And these exit doors trap us in lies. It all started when he saw that woman, in Inspector Dalac's office. - A bundle of dough. -Dalac was that kind of private detective who loved to quote. He liked brandishing his revolver and the great authors. What had motivated Ms. Château-Têtard to go to Dalac? -The little whore. -The age of the house and the seriousness that emanated from it. -There. When I told you he was coming. Here... Uh... - Jerome. - Jerome, there you go. Come closer, Jerome. I present to you Mrs. Château-Têtard, lifts of the same name. You can say hi to him, no billing on that. No ? It is Jérôme who will deal with your little problem. -Isn't he a bit young? - No, on the contrary, in spinning mills, the younger it is, the less suspicion there is. And as Racine said, "To well-born souls, "Value does not wait." -Corneille. - That's what I said. - Nope. - Finally, it's the same. - Nope. My little Jerome, I explain to you. Already, it is not necessary to bayer to the crows (Corneille in French). Do you know Corneille? Madam loves it very much. Madame has a son who has a wife, and it's this wife you're being asked to tail, okay? -I let you discuss with your trainee. -He hasn't been a trainee since the day before yesterday. -That's it. Cut your meter. -What do I have to do ? -Find the lover. Here is the address of the Château-Têtards. Spinning, lover, report, fees. Find the lover. And here's the wife, Ava. Oh damn... Wow! Nice piece. First thing, go through his bank account. See if there's any shady spending. - How are you going to get his readings? - I have my starters. Don't forget I'm a detective. - The rest, you know it. On the 1st day, Jérôme had been grilled by Ava. On the 2nd day, he had slipped naked Ava into a double bass. And on the third, they both slipped naked into a bed. Jerome was trying to find his way out. - Here, read this. -The bank statements of little Château-Têtard? No, it's a medical record. -That's what the banker told me. -There is a DNA test, it's really personal. It's resold, personal data. Didn't you know? This is what bankers ask for loans. If we tell the bankers everything, it ends up in anyone's hands. -The number of boyfriends before marriage! - Modest people don't dare piss off their banker. That's how it is, poor people. He obeys its banker, that's it. -Sometimes they refuse to obey. - But then, there, it becomes a revolution. - The bourgeois also obey. -Them, when they disobey, it gives a coup d'etat. Like in Chile, for example. Oh, by the way, your spinning, what did it do? - Nothing to report. - What do you mean, nothing to report? Didn't get spotted? -Non... She went to the museum. - Which museum? Paris is the city of museums. I dunno ? Beaubourg? Orsay? - Yes, Orsay. -What did she do ? - She visited, ate an ice cream? - That's right, she ate an ice cream after seeing the paintings. -What kind of paintings? -The paintings all look a bit alike. So I followed her and nothing to report. Phone *-Hello, it's me. - Good morning, Mrs. Château-Têtard. *-That's amazing... -Comment ? Naked in a double bass? *-Little Whore. -Excellent ! *- I'm not crazy! -She went to the museum, she saw paintings. You know, the paintings, they all look the same. And she ate ice cream... Nothing to report. There... *-At the museum? But I don't understand... - Decidedly, the investigation stalled. -Is it art that gives you this look? -Enough to ? -What are you talking about ? Art does not interest Ava. -You didn't want to go to the museum? -At the Museum ? To do what ? No. -You are getting more and more derailed. - What did you do this afternoon? -I saw my goddaughter at Épinay. My friend Noémie whom you had seen, but you didn't like her. -The one that is black. -I'm going to see my goddaughter since she can't come here. - Mrs. Château-Têtard was taken aback by such a lie. She almost spit out the piece she was following her, and that she knew about the museum. But she stood. She promised herself to make him swallow his lies, to this dirty little whore. She would clear up this dark matter of museum and goddaughter. -Bizarre, I thought you had nothing to do with your goddaughter. -I couldn't say that, it's my only family. - No, there's us. - We, we count for nothing? -I love roast. -I hate meat in the evening. Let's go to coffee. -Ava never takes coffee in the evening. - It's true, I forgot. So she finished her meal. Conchita, double ration of dessert, I'm starving. Oh, then yes, I take roast. You will serve Paul. Paul, tomorrow, you have the Board of Directors of Château-Têtard & Fils. -The what ? Board of directors. You are the president. -Yes... Every time I get bored. I don't want to go there. -It is important. You have to show up, darling. *-We have a problem. *The little girl claims to have been with her goddaughter and not at the museum. *Find out why she's lying to her stepmom. *I can put you on another move. - Above all not, we change nothing. I know the animal well. *-Be discreet. -Because of a bulwark of morality built by his parents, Jerome was uncomfortable having sex with Ava being paid at the union rate. Not counting overtime. He knew that by confessing everything, he would lose everything. -Ava, I have to tell you something. About my job. - Well, since you're unemployed. -I'm not a gigolo. - No, it's runoff. Paul explained it to me. Don't tell me you have work, we won't be able to see each other anymore. If you only knew how boring it is at home. -Sexually? -You're crazy ? We never talk about it. The clock rings. - Damn, I have to go. I'm not going there, I don't want to be bored with the gray men from the Board. Upbeat music ... The phone is ringing. ... Mom, are you picking up? Mom, pick up! Hello ? Paul Château-Têtard, himself. Laughter -Long live the stairs! To hell with Pinochet! I see where you're coming from, rascal. -Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! I am fired. - I'm blocked, unblock. It's worse. -I'm trying to unblock. - Mom, I got fired! The Board fired me! - They dared? I will settle their account. The dog, at the foot. We will scare them. The dog. At the foot. Down, dog! Howls -Adelaide! -Maman ! -She's still moving. She is dead ! -You are very nice, Ava. I like to be woken up by the scent of a flower. You too smell good. You are a good person. My son had the courage not to marry money. I suffered too much from the arranged union to impose it on Paul. Ava, I love you very much. - Me too, I love you very much. I made you a coffee. - How nice, my child. Will you accompany me in Rolls this afternoon? I would like to introduce you to my best friend. And we could invite your goddaughter. Who is so beautifully black. -Yes with pleasure. Do not worry. With Paul, we do everything to have a child. If it's a girl, we'll call her after you. The Pinochet is showing signs of fatigue. It will be fixed next week. How about going to the Seychelles, or in cure in Vichy, the time of the repair? -It's a good idea ! Look. I'm getting up. I walk. It's a miracle. Fracas Thank you, Conchita. You pulled me out of a terrible nightmare. Always this recurring dream with Ava. It was traumatic. - Puppy, I have your breakfast. - No, I want to sleep. I'm in bad spirits, I have the flu. -The dog. -Something is wrong ? -Paul gave me his flu. I threw it all up this morning. -We don't vomit for the flu. - Stomach flu. What if it's poisoning? - Which museum today? -None, on Tuesday the museums are closed. - So... At the Vincennes zoo? With this rotten weather? She's crazy? I'm sorry for you. Spinning in this weather... It must have been awful. - It wasn't great. -Are you sure there isn't a man under there? -No... -I've found. Can't you see? -No. -Think. No idea ? It is, however, quite obvious. And if... was it a woman? -If there is a lover it is a man. And there isn't, I know something about that. -That's boring. -There wouldn't be a man in the family who... -Raoul. He has relations with our Château-Têtard. - Are you saying it now? -I'm talking about Madame Château-Têtard mother. Your client. -How do you know that? -I'm a detective. -Dalac sighed heavily and picked up the phone. - Mrs. Chateau-Tetard? Dalac here. *-At the Vincennes zoo, in the rain? It's unthinkable. -But it's the truth. -I read at the hairdresser that sugar gives girls more and the salty, boys. Provided you are pregnant, of course. Instead of grapefruit, I asked for mushrooms. Finally, bites to the queen. Mushrooms bother you? Are you worried that they are poisonous? You look small, Ava. Did you have the courage to go out in this weather? -Yes. Where did you go ? -I visited the Louvre. -The Louvre... Are you sure? -Yes, I just told you, the Louvre. -The Louvre, on a Tuesday? There weren't too many people, at least? - Yes, it was full. We could barely move forward. I couldn't see anything. Laughter -I don't doubt that. Especially since the museum is closed on Tuesdays. -Ah... It's strange, I didn't notice anything. Now that you say it, there were totally empty rooms. - But then, how did you manage to enter? - I stayed outside, I looked at the museum through the windows. And I visited the garden. The famous zoological garden of the Louvre. And that's where you went to the zoo. -No. Since there are none. -You heard ? - Heard what? -She lies like she breathes. Doesn't that make you jump? But think! -I noted the contradictions. I'm tired of investigating. -It's not your job. For the honor of the family, I hired a private detective. -Ah ? And the verdict, then? -The verdict ? Your wife is visiting the zoo in the rain, and she says she went to the Louvre. - She lies without gravity. If she prefers monkeys to the Mona Lisa, that's okay. -And when she actually goes to the museum, she says she went to see her goddaughter. The only explanation for this kind of behavior, she's crazy! A mythomaniac! Paul... We'll have to sort that out. And there are not 36 solutions. You want commit Ava? -Doctor Anigo is coming tomorrow for my back. I'm going to have your wife's brain checked. -Dr Anigo ? -Raoul ! - Do you trust? mysterious music ... Honey, we need to talk. - I sleep, I get up early for the museum tomorrow. -I'll tell you tomorrow. -That's all ? Tell me since you woke me up. -Listen... Mom, guided by the affection she has for you... I'm sure. Didn't you notice you had a bodyguard, a guardian angel? You know what I mean ? -I don't understand your gibberish. -You haven't noticed that someone is following you like a detective? -So what ? - So, nothing. Finally Yes... A little problem. -I can explain it to you. Paul, how I love you! It's a misunderstanding. - Calm down, you have nothing to reproach yourself for. It doesn't matter, just... Stop lying, honey. When you go to the zoo, like this afternoon, let us know. If you visit a museum, you tell us. Why are you talking about all these salads? - Didn't he say anything else, this detective? -What do you want him to say? There is nothing. It's heard ? No more ugly lies? Life isn't always fun with mom. - No, we never go out. -Listen, if you like museums so much, tomorrow, I'll go with you somewhere. Intriguing music ... -This bas-relief has lost all its relief. A 15th century virgin on polychrome wood whose colors have disappeared. - What a naughty object! When I think of Jerome... ... -It's not okay ? What is happening ? -I don't know, a little anemia, maybe. - Did you cut it short? -Ava felt bad. -Fortunately Dr. Anigo is still there. It's up to you, doctor. *- I tell him : * "bro, what are you doing ?" -What do you see ? -Nothing. -And there? -Always nothing. -You are sure ? Not even a skull or a vagina? *-And here I defuse the bomb. *-Do you know how to do it? - Are you vomiting? - Yes, it comes from food? -Yes, gastro or appendicitis. *- I'm in the car, I see a suspicious face... -So ? - I am subject to professional secrecy. Your daughter-in-law has all her head. For the rest, I'll let her tell you. *-Go ahead, I'm getting up. *I'm going to see him, and then I understand. - And you, mom, are you all right? You don't have anymore hallucinations ? - No, I never had hallucinations! I saw her naked! *- I defuse the quiet bomb. *-Do you really know what to do? *-Of course, what do you think? - Ava, where are you going? -I'm going back to the Cluny museum because of yesterday's shortened visit. -Do you mind going alone? - No, don't worry, my bichon. -Is your nausea better? -Yes Yes Yes. Don't worry, my puppy. -Ava, are you still going to the museum? I told you not to use the Pinochet! -I do not use it. -I take the Rolls. -I do not use it. -I'm going to the board. Intriguing music ... -Here we are. You remember this scene. We took a few detours, but it deserved some explanation. -Inspector Dalac? Adelaide Chateau-Têtard. The little whore came out. This time, we've got it. - Have you picked up the pieces? So, let's move on. Upbeat music ... -Jerome! ... Jerome! -What is going on ? - You took the wrong stairs, go around the top. ... - I am followed. I changed to fool the spinning mill. A private follows me. - Private of what? - A cop, what! The Old Château-Têtard has me followed. We have a detective hot on our heels. He's a moron, he must be following someone else. Or it's a hideout who combines his reports at home. I have another news. I am pregnant. Well, is that all the effect it has on you? -You're sure ? - That I'm pregnant? - No, that you are followed? -Paul told me. "Mom loves you so much she gave you a private. "You have nothing to say to me ?" He tells me that I was at the zoo, while I was at the hotel with you. And me, I said I was at the Louvre. Do you see the mess? It's crazy that we never spotted this guy. I wonder what he looks like. -The baby ? - No, the detective! -I feel bad, I must have caught your flu. It doesn't work, the vaccine. - It was not the flu, nor a poison, I am pregnant. I will leave Paul and the Queen Mother. It's your child. Let's settle down together, with the baby. - Wait, I'm thinking. I have a salary of 1200 euros. I pay 800 euros in rent plus taxes. More 400 euros of food. Plus a baby, nanny, diapers. My future is behind me... My life is screwed up. -Where is he going ? Where are you going ? -An appointment, I had forgotten! It's for work. -Jerome! - Do you know what you did? Geoffroy, the clause. Maître Crépin is going to read you a clause that concerns you. -It's a footnote to the bylaws. Article 5 C, paragraph 4.2... “If the president is dismissed during a Board, "if the vote takes place in his absence, "Mme Château-Têtard mother "would replace him until the designation of a new president. "In the absence of this new president, "the voters "must be domiciled for tax purposes "in France." - Ladies and gentlemen, I am your president. -Inspector? Inspector? There is someone ? Over-grown slug? Pigheaded! -Turn around, you bastard. Laughter You have to learn to draw faster if you want to stay in the business. - Do we need a weapon for our investigations? -Anyway, what are you doing at the office when you have to work? - I finished the investigation. - What ? -I have completed the Château-Têtard investigation. Ava Château-Têtard is Raoul's mistress. The chauffeur. -It's not possible ! Oh, the rascal! He becomes the mother and the daughter-in-law. We will vote to designate our new president. Unless you want to be taxed in France? Since we agree, who votes to designate Paul Château-Têtard, my son, as president of Château-Têtard & Fils? It's a show of hands. Perfect, you made the right choice. phone vibrator *-Inspector Dalac. Madame Château-Têtard, elevators? -I'm in the Board meeting. What is it ? *- I have the name of the lover. *Come by taxi. -Let's go. The dog. Raoul ! Thank you. I will continue by taxi. -A taxi ? Adelaide, is there a problem? -Everything is fine. See you tonight. Come by for some champagne. - Taxi! - Taxi! Taxi ! Did we catch the little whore? The day is prolific. -I feel that you will taste the news. Come, come! -Raoul ? - Mrs. Chateau-Tetard? Madame Chateau-Tetard? Ouh, ouh! Madame Chateau-Tetard? Wake up, Madame Château-Têtard! Madame Château-Têtard, wake up! Wake up, Madame Château-Têtard! A shot rang out. Go on. She moans. ... -Raoul ! Why did you cheat on me with the little whore? - Adelaide, what are you talking about? Adelaide, I would never have done that! -Bastard! - It's not my style at all. Adelaide, please! I don't like young people. Please calm down. -You will pay for that ! -Adelaide, but it's not true! Please, Adelaide, calm down. Calm down. -I'll fire you. You won't be coming back to this house anymore. Open this door! - Please calm down! Think for a second. I didn't cheat on you. You are mistaken about my masculine side. Adelaide! Adelaide, please! Think for a second. Calm down. Don't throw everything in the trash. Noise -Where is he ? Paul ! Paul ! -Maman ! I am going to be a dad. I'm going to be dad, mom! Ava... You are so proud of me. No, I'm so proud of you! Raoul ! Raoul, do you know the news? Raoul ! Dad and president on the same day! What a manly day! Raoul ? Raoul ! Raoul ? -My hat... Has a cas ... - We will miss him, Raoul. It's going to be weird. A big void, right? Conchita, you bring me a cigarette and a fire. -I'm sorry, ma'am. Mr. Paul does not want us to smoke in the presence of Madame, who is pregnant. -You won, my dear. You are stronger than I imagined. But it's still Raoul that I resent the most. Raoul, how I will miss you. At least you'll be away from her. Far from the little whore. -Jerome dumped me, I'm pregnant. The father doesn't want the baby, but I have a husband who wants to be a father. Things worked out as they should. What could be more natural ? Jerome... - Watch out for your little belly, my treasure. No, don't cry. Finally, yes, cry. Don't worry, it's the hormones. You want a liquor to cheer you up? Oui ? - Jerome, I'm going to be bored without you. When the baby is born, I will play with him. Yes, but until birth? I'll take care of her room, her little clothes... The baby will annoy me. Honk -Paul ! You need a driver. -Oh dear ! Don't wear that. It's vulgarity! -It's the law ! -I command you to disobey! - Mom, it's bad to know me. -Tell me, Jerome, look at this. I don't understand it at all. -It's an account statement. In the red. I wouldn't like to be in their place. -You won't be anymore soon. It 's the agency's account statements. -I am fired ? - What do you want, huh? It's the fault of the socialists who are in power. - Which socialists? - Well, all that... -Sorry, you're way too narrow. Have a good day. You. Thank you, gentlemen. Good morning sir. Me Geoffroy Crépin, lawyer. Are you coming for the announcement? - Yes. My cover letter. - Do you have any flaws? - Faults ? -Greed, gluttony, anger, laziness, solidarity? -Uh... -Qualities ? Are you integrated into the company? - With this job, this job, I imagine being able to move up the social ladder. -Don't go too high. You won't be working with me . I just come to select you, pass judgment. - You are not a lawyer? Do you judge too? -Any idiot can judge. Just look at the person's head, his speech, his bearing, and it is judged. Do you know how to drive? Do you know how to drive? - Do you know how to drive? - Yes. -Hello. Paul Château-Têtard. You are hired, you will be our driver. The commitment takes effect tomorrow. We leave for Antibes. Watch out, my wife is expecting a baby. Do you know how to drive a Rolls? -Maman ? Our new Raoul has arrived. -As if we could replace Raoul... Intriguing music ... It's Raoul, huh, the father? ... Why is Doctor Anigo here? He's still there for Ava? ... -I said to be careful! - What about me? And me ? - How are you, my dove? -I'm not going down alone. Come and help me ! It's insane! Who are these people ? Who is it ? What are you doing ? What is happening ? Doctor, what's going on? I saw her come out naked from a double bass! I am not crazy ! I am not crazy ! - Me neither, ma'am. -Dr Anigo ! triumphal music ... -Forward, Raoul. ... What do you think of our new Raoul? ... Upbeat music ...
