This is the city where I was born. I love Anna Zacchaeus. Every day I wake up with the same hope. Will I find a suitable husband for me? I do not think in another thing. # Beautiful are the sun and the roses of the month of May. # # Beautiful is the sun, beautiful is the sun, May comes and April dies. # # Who is inside, who is outside, who is around me? # # Who wants freesias, who wants lilies, who takes me, who leaves me? # # Whoever observes me in this reed is looking for who knows what. # # I give you a beautiful rose to put in your hair ... # - And that would be the beautiful rose? - What more day? It's a saying. "Lower, boy, lower." Do you always paint this building? Don't you remember? From what? A kiss when we were children? Hopefully! "Lower, boy, lower." - Peppine ', are you ready? - Right away. My younger brother works in a barbershop. It's been two years now. With the excuse that he must learn the trade, they still do not pay him. No, these gloves are not ours. My mother just sews them. Every week they are brought directly from the factory. It is a job that many other women do in my neighborhood. My brother Pasquale is a sailor, ... but he has never found a ship to enlist in. But every morning he shines his shoes, so it looks like he goes to work. My father is a cable car driver. Since I can remember every morning ... ... always wrap your breakfast with the same oilcloth. Since you're going out, call me this pool. Don't lose it, it's worth millions. Play a Lotto for me. A lotus, have you understood? 37, 50 and 22. - Do you know what 22 is? The float! - What float, daddy? Money is only earned by working. And you don't send me to work. You are not cut out for work! Listen to your father! You will see how the carriage comes with a prince inside. Listen, listen. Is it coming? It comes over there. That's a float with a beggar on it. We don't need a chariot, we have a prince here. And then I won't make any more gloves, I'll buy them. This is Don Antonio. How many bouquets of flowers have you sent me until today? I lost the count. Don Antonio owns four or five businesses. He also has a car. - Nann , do you want me to comb your hair? - Good morning, Filomena. �Francesco! Good morning At your service, Don Antonio. - Where is my driver? - I'm here. How many times should I tell you not to sell any more fish? You are my driver. Buenos d�as. Peppinie ', what are you doing? Come on, I'll take you to the barbershop, I have to go to the market. �Qu� antip�tica! - Don Antonio, do you want coffee? - Shut up, go inside. �Por favor, s�rvanse! Help yourself, gentlemen, look how many buns! Sailor, buy the lady a pizza. �Pizza! Fresh eggs, from our land! They just put them on! Fresh, fresh! Have an egg! We all need eggs! Passion, my despair! What eyes does he have! You're going to ruin me, miss. - 60 liras. - 50. No, no! Now he says he wants it for free! I'm not coming here anymore. I'll change the counter. �No, no! You can't do that to me. Okay, we leave it at 50. It is women who bring mourning to families. That is why I am still single. Do you need something, sailor? Bella soap is the only product that cleans any stain. Any dirt. Come to my secretary, who was born suffering? Show these gentlemen how Bella soap works miracles. �Bravo! And here is one of our most beautiful clients! Let's make a deal, miss. We give you a bar of soap ... ... and in return you take our balloon to your home. That is not fair. Who are you, Queen Tait? - I? But what do you want from me! - This is bullshit! One moment! Advertising is the lifeblood of commerce. We are in our right. If the lady accepts, the deal is done. �Oh, s�! - Congratulations, miss. - Thanks. Whoa, whoa. Go home with the balloon. All the way, it is important. People look at her, not at the balloon! Yes, but he only looks at her because she uses Bella soap! - I'm a thief. - A thief? - Yes. - Oh my God! - �Un ladr�n? �Y d�nde est�? - �Aqu�, arr�stenlo! What do you say about a thief! Come on, get out! How many men! You just have to choose. But who would she want for a husband? Maybe this one, but it doesn't come close. �Atenci�n, batall�n! The next day was Sunday. I went to the sea with Caterina, my only friend. It was a lonely beach, nobody ever went there. - Caterina, I'm going to try. - How did your mother bring you into the world? They say it is wonderful, something different. Do you know that foreigners come to Capri on purpose to bathe like this? You watch, then I'll do it for you, okay? What do you say? I just keep watch. It's better if no one sees my legs. - I'm ashamed. - Who is going to see you? I scare myself to see them. How exaggerated! You always think you are uglier than you are. Are you upset, Caterina? Nanny, if she were as pretty as you, she would be married to a king. And what would he do with a king? I have tried everything. I have even prayed the St. Pasquale novena. Nine nights on the balcony. Saint Pasquale Baylon, patron of women, ... send me a husband, white, red and colorful. Like you, just like you. Oh, glorious Saint Pasquale! - Nothing! - It looks like you've lost faith! I must have forgotten some ejaculation. But I have found a remedy. If the novena is not enough, I will make a promise to San Pasquale. Saint Pasquale, if you find me a husband, I will dress like you, with habit and string. If you find a husband later, you'll have to dress like that seriously. �Eh! �Eh! Don't go out, wait! Eh! Eh! Perd�n. - Thanks, can you turn around? - Sorry. Come on, come on! - Don't turn around. - Sorry, sorry. Didn't you recognize me? - Do you know him? - Yes. Yes and no. Sailor, you're nice, but we can't trust it. Take a few steps away. �Ah� vale! Enough! This is how you will be ashamed and leave! He already did it to me once! That's how I met Andrea. This time it did not disappear. I haven't introduced myself yet. Andrea Grati, at your service. - Encantada, Anna Zacchaeus. - Caterina Capito. - May I accompany you? - Why not? Let's go. Perd�n. - I'm from Ancona. - From North. - Excuse me? - Oh ... Always with "sorry". - It must be very religious. - Well ... the truth... Already, in the north they are a little ... How do you say? Carefree. You know, miss? I've been following her for a week. - Really? - Yes. I have not noticed. I could tell him what clothes he's wearing when he's in a good mood and ... ... when she's sad because she's laughed with her boyfriend. - I don't have a boyfriend. - Oh, thank goodness! �Opl�! Anna! I can not believe it. On this side I will see less of this thing. How has it swelled! Do you want to look in the mirror? Are you not ashamed to be seen with someone like that? Lo ve? It gives her shame, she saves it. Ah, what! An hour ago I was like this. Don't you have a civilian photo? I was born in a uniform. - Look! - What a front! - It is true that it is a problem. - The what? The one who walks with you must be fighting at all times. - They all look at her. - Is it my fault? No, but if I were you, I would dress differently. It's late, I have to go home. I have to go. But how! Now that I have found the value, do you want to go? - We'll see you at the market tomorrow. - No, not tomorrow. If he forgets about me. - Shall we eat together? - Are you crazy? That is not right! It depends on who you go with. Yeah, what do I tell them at home? - Have you ever told a lie? - Never. Make up one to please me. - You can tell she was with her friend. - Caterina! Oh Jesus! Where is Caterina? Do you want to see if something has happened to you? - She understood. - What did you understand? That was of more. Well, without Caterina with you, I'm not going! �Eh, eh! If you don't eat, neither do I. I don't eat lunch with the first person to pass. Being here you have already committed. You should eat. First you force me to come and now you think badly of me! - I'm going! - No, wait! Nice gratitude. Sit down. - I'm stupid. I shouldn't have come. - And why? They say that the sailors have a woman in each port. They say that for you to enroll. But it is not true. A donation, sir? Always at your service. Thank you. 200 lire to the musicians? You are a real sailor. In my house they have accustomed me badly. I am an only child, a privileged person. Every month my father sends me a check. I don't know how to spend it. Spend, spend, it never ends. So in your house you are rich. We are not bad, we have some land. - And why are you a sailor? - The sailor travels the world and ... And I travel to find a wife. Who knows how many pretty girls there are in your land. It is difficult to find an honest girl. That's the question. Today's girls are too free. I better go home. If I stay, you will say that I am too free. Goodbye No, wait! Waiter, the bill. I'll walk you home, wait. It is useless. - I have to go home by force. - Why? - My father is giving a party, I can't miss it. - I'm going too. Are you crazy? There are colleagues of my father, distinguished people. - Too bad, we could go to the theater together. - No, I said no. Oh wait! You're my whole life. You don't know how much I have suffered for you. I have always loved you and always carried you in my heart. Gennar, don't talk like that! You know I'm not worthy of you! I'm lost. Now go, because Pasqualino is capable of killing us both! But I love you, Mar . I love you and I can't lose you. You don't like it? - �Qu�? - �Mira! - It doesn't reach me. - Silence! - Pasqualino is here! Go away! - I'm leaving! - Who were you talking to? - With nobody. Don't lie, I've seen you. You were talking to Gennarino, your lover. How many times do I have to tell you that you belong to me only? You can't go to the theater with you, don't stay still. The seats are hard. �M�rchese! Let's change places. - No, I'm fine here. - Yes, but ... - �Marinero, v�yase! - �Si�ntese, si�ntese! One moment, one moment. Has seen? And look! If my father weren't in jail, you wouldn't treat me like that! Don't make me laugh, you and your father! You know that nobody rules me. And you will do what I say, otherwise it will be worse for you! It's yours. And the other? Oh God, it's lost. Tomorrow I'll bring you a new pair to the market. My mother has a small glove factory. �C�mo? Then... - You are rich too. - In a way. I have a brother who studies and another who has a barber business. Ah... I'm going. You are not made for me. I prefer a poor girl. - Go Go. - Make up your mind, if you want to go, go! How heavy! It is understood. Let's change places, if I don't, I'm going to fight. Less bad. - What if I were serious? - Well... - So you like me a little ... - Who said that? Daughter! It's me, your father! "Daddy!" Oh, Dad! - Yes, she is! I have returned to avenge your honor! - Have you had a boyfriend? - No, I am very demanding. Me too. I'm glad to see you. Let's chat. I have shot into the air to see your pallor in the face of death. And also because you're a bastard. What have you done with my daughter's honor? �Te r�es? What do you want from me? Pasquale Esposito, you are a bastard and you must die! Before I shot into the air, but now I will kill you like the last of men! Yes, arrest me, I don't care! This time I'm glad to go to jail ... ... because I have avenged my honor ... ... and I have wiped a poisonous snake from the face of the earth. Come on, brigadiers! This great love found the perfect conclusion. Gennaro married his Marietta and they lived happily heart to heart. When his father got out of jail early, for good behavior, ... after so much suffering, she returned to her daughter, happy and content. Sailor, is it okay? We have seen a wedding. Brings luck. - It would have been better to go to the movies. - You're never happy. The father was moving. I would have killed Pasquale Esposito with my bare hands. Is your father like that? Shoot? My father is a good man, perhaps too good. Hurry, if I don't come back at nine, they'll put me in prison for the whole month. Let's not start, I'm going home. Come with me, come on. We have been together so little. No, it's too late for me. Slowly, slowly! Hurry, I'm late. Wait! The shoe! You're going to make me fall! - Hopefully! This is how I carry you! - What a fool! What do you want? Come on, you're late! - It is true that you are very pretty. - Liar. - Will you come to the market tomorrow? - Tomorrow? No, not tomorrow. - Why? - Well ... Let's run, let's go! �Despacio! - Tell me if you're going to come to the market tomorrow! - I'll tell you later! Run! The shoe! Have you seen? My shoe has fallen off! When I go to the beach I dress badly. If not, good clothes go bad. I have to tell you... I have to tell you something. I am poor, what do you think? I've told you a lot of lies. My father has the land, but it belongs to someone else. He works there! My father drives the tram on the funicular. We are six brothers. I am the fourth. I couldn't weigh in the family, so I signed up. My mother sews the gloves. 200 pairs a week. - Come on, it's getting late! - Wait, let's stop for a moment. - No, not here. - Why? It's very dark. I have to talk to you, Anna. Tomorrow, at the market. Won't I see you tomorrow? No. - Tonight, Anna. - It's getting late. No. Anna, in four months I will be graduating. You have no art or part, you are a sailor. It is not true. I have a trade. Soy mec�nico. From sailor to mechanic! You laugh, but mechanic can be a good deal. I can establish myself. In these five years I have saved some money. I have saved. You don't believe me? Why are you telling me those things? Because I'm serious. It's late! What does it matter? I'll go to prison anyway. No, you must not go to prison! Run, run! In Naples, with women there is nothing to do. Because you are dumb. Is it true that you have a cinema on the ship? We have a broom, not a movie theater. Listens... Tomorrow I leave. I'm going far away. And you tell me now? If I had told you before, you would not have stayed. But I will return. Within 4 months I am licensed. I don't believe you! But I ... I love you, Anna. Do you like children? S�. �Me escribir�s? �Y t� me contestar�s? See what a husband I'm going to be! At home you will be the boss! I'll go back and tell you everything I've done! We are not like in Naples. We take women like that! No, the man must be the man! You must send! Okay, I'll send. - But you, will you wait for me? - Look, they're closing. Tell me if you love me. Vete, vete. When I come back from Africa I will bring you a monkey. And what do I do with it? I want a necklace! �Andrea! �Andrea! - Just a minute. - Agree. Is that free? Is there a bit for me? - Eh, eh! - “Vamos, basta ya! Instead of sentinels we look like matchmakers. Come on, guys! Come this way, don't go! I'll be back soon, maybe I'll escape. I'm jealous, Anna. Here, as a souvenir. But they will put you in prison. Better, this way I will have time to think about you. - I ... it's like I'm already married. - Me too. We were married in one day. How are you? Will you see each other again? Did you kiss? - Sight. - Oh God. Was it underneath? And how did it turn out? - What are you talking about? - How what about what? From the sailor! Andrea is gone, but when she comes back we will get married. - Caterina, I'm in love. - Oh, Jesus! What about them? I have no courage to tell it. Dad waits for a prince and mom for Don Antonio, the wholesaler. I'll tell you everything, but don't tell anyone, huh? Do you think I'm a snitch? Look, Qatar. I do not have anything. According to my mother, whoever wants to marry should take me as I am. - That I carry the dowry in my personality. - Yes ... - But do you know what I'm going to do? - What? I will look for a job and prepare my dowry. I need so many things. At least two changes of sheets, two nightgowns ... Qatar, I would love some luxury! But everything I have is old-fashioned. - The pantyhose too! - Give it to me! I've done the math. With four months of work I buy everything I need. - Do you find it easy to find a job? - They will want to hire me! S�... - But now a battle awaits me. - Eh eh... - Dad, I want to work. - Anna wants to work! - Have you fallen out of bed? - Go shopping. I do not understand. Women work and men stay home. Yesterday I walked 24 hours! I understand that Caterina is looking for work because it is difficult for her to find a husband. - But you, my daughter ... - I want to work! - And we don't want to, okay? - Do what your mother says! - �No! - �S�! - �No! - �S�! My parents' protests were of no use. Get to work! Come on, come on! - Is it coming for the ad? - Yes. Do you want to know? She is pretty, too pretty. But it doesn't work for me. It doesn't work for me, really! It stands out too much in a store! I devalued the merchandise! But outside it is written "I am looking for a clerk with a good appearance" - Yes, but not so much! - You must be kidding ... Girl I don't want no trouble. Look here, look! If he comes here, or stops everything ... ... or I will be forced to hire only female staff. - The box is heavy, huh? Weight! - Yes. Look at you! - My daughter, you are not normal! - You're right, very unusual! - Now he's going! - Where are you going? Get to work! Can it? I'm here for the usher position. Oh yeah, go ahead. In a minute I'm with you. Oh, si�ntese. - Do you have experience? - No. - And what did you do before? - I was in house. Oh, poor thing! Do you know what it means to be an usher? You must guide those who come to the movies to your seat, right? Yes, yes, but ushering is delicate work. You have to be polite, precise and above all, reserved. This is the usher's working instrument. Do you know him? S�. I'm going to show you how it works. Come with me. So, do you hire me? I settle for little. We'll see. Please come. Close the roof! The usher is here under the door. What is it called? - Anna Zaccheo. - Anna, very good. The customer comes in and you ask, "How many seats?" But with kindness, with courtesy, because if not ... there is no tip! This way, follow me. Now you. Take. Imagine that I am a customer. No, not to the face! Light up the hallway! Aqu�. No, too far. I am a bit myopic. Closer, a little closer. Aqu is good. Not bad. But he has yet to learn to use the flashlight. It's easy to disrupt the show. - What does he do? Leave me! - Wait a moment. - You fool! - Come on! I'm not going to eat you! No, it wasn't my wedding day. Andrea was always far away ... ... and after much searching I had not found anything better than this job. Sir, all set! - Your name is Nicolino, right? - Yes, Nicolino Abratazzato. - How old are you? - 19 years, 5 months and 27 days. I'm 23. Only four years apart. 23 years for a woman are many. - Giulia Zaccheo ... - Yes? - I have to give him his salary. - Thanks. - Have you revealed about this morning? - Yes, sir. Come. So, are you getting used to it? - Yes, but ... - But what? - Eat well, sir. - Go ahead, talk. I took this job because you told me it was serious. Why? Isn't it? If I have to tell the truth, no. The photographer, the old man ... ... says a lot of dirty things. He tries to touch me and he wears a ring on his finger. So what? Can't a married man like another woman? You are very young. There are disgusting people everywhere. You must learn it. - I've already learned. - Now you must learn to bear it. Happens. You will often come across this kind of thing. - Men are vulgar. - I know. Defend yourself then, perhaps with a slap. Trust me, you must take the world as it is. There are also people who rule over me, but I'm not complaining. The important thing is to work honestly and earn money. With money you get everything, and there is never enough, right? - What does he eat? - House things. A m� tambi�n me gustar�a. - Here. - Thanks. It's your first pay, right? Enjoy it well. Goodbye Adi�s. When I saw that bedroom in the window ... ... I thought of Andrea and had an idea. I wanted to surprise you. "I think of you night and day. Always yours, Andrea." So, are you engaged or not? Engaged ... Not really. No sailor will enter this house! Maybe he's a nobleman. Yes, of course! When has a simple sailor been noble? - You are an ignorant. - Of course... How did the Duke of Abruzzi start? As a sailor! This is how they learn and two years later they become admirals! But what are you saying! And where is that sailor from? - From Ancona! - From the North! Then you must have money! Dad, in the North or the South, we are all starving. I do not say the sailor, ... but if I liked a good boy and he was poor ... Couldn't I marry him? And I would have to work another ten years on the funicular! - And I make gloves! - And I sweep the hairs of all Naples! I am 30 years old and I cannot afford even a pack of cigarettes. Please, Countess. Strike a pose. Teach a little more. That's it. Sorry if I touch you, princess. - The face like that ... - The face we said no! It is to complete the pose. Only the thighs, only the thighs! Just like that. What a wonder! Well ... Hold it ... Take cover! And now I would like one ... like this! - What would it be like? - With bare legs, Hawaiian style. - With bare legs? - Yes, with the Orione stockings in hand. Is good, is good. This is full-length! They have done it full body! We do it right away, without calling Mr. Illuminato. Yes, we do it between ourselves. Show the lady how you want her to pose. - You scoundrels! They should be ashamed! - What a voice! What passion! Get into the pose for the next one. Give me that badge! Come here, listen! I already said I was stupid! You better get out! Here you work, no jokes! He's going to lose me a million, at the very least. - She is ashamed. - You shut up! - �Sal! - �No! - I'm going to call the director! - Why do you want to lose your job? - I don't care! - Sir ... Lady, I am Illuminato. Open up, don't be a girl. - What is it? - Ask them. They have photographed me full-length, with deception. I can't waste time on the whims of your employees. You give the orders, but here I am the one who decides. - Then our agreement is over! - Okay. Goodbye Goodbye! People are crazy ... Don't worry, I have the badge. Sorry, because of me you lost an important client. Here, swine. I need your help, Anna. This agency is still young, but if my plan is successful, ... will become a great agency. Like the American ones! All modern! Painters, elegant decoration ... We will do great things together. And we will win a lot. Me and you too. - I discovered it, do not abandon me. - I can't stand certain guys. Men are vulgar. I already told you that girls are judged by their looks. If they are pretty, they lose their minds. Even me, if I looked at her a lot ... - You are always nice to me. - Kind? Truth be told, when I hired her before I knew ... ... if it was good or bad, honest or not, ... I just saw that she was pretty. - Maybe I'm just like everyone else. - No, you are good. - �Usted cree? - S�. Quiz�s. He knows that we are alone in here. I recently signed an important contract ... ... with a large beachwear house to do all your advertising. We must start now so that everything is ready in spring. Our work will flood the world. America, France, Germany! I'll pay you well, I'll see. We will work for a year. - �Acepta? - S�. I was sure. These are color photographs. Do you like it? Yes, but what happened today must not happen again. From now on only I will take care of you, I guarantee it. Life for a girl is difficult. But who has the easy life? I have had a thousand jobs and I have always succeeded alone. Remember, Anna, you move on alone in life. What have you bought with your first payment? Any. What do you mean nothing? Won't you tell me? A bedroom. - So, is she engaged? - Yes. We will leave Naples and start tomorrow or the day after with the photographs. Ah, here! An advance on your next job. Thanks for everything. - You can go. Goodbye - Bye. Drink a little, I'll get warm. - Let's make it quick. - Nicolino, give him the ball. S�, se�or. No, not like this. Overhead, arms outstretched. - You, make it look like you're playing. - Yes, sir. I can not do it. The sky is gray and the colors are distorted. Soon it will start to rain. We will have to leave it for tomorrow. Anna, you can get dressed. - Desm ntalo. - Nicol , chame una mano. Go. Nicol , take the ball. - Are you still cold? - No, I'm better now. Well. Take another sip. Don't worry, you will be paid even if we didn't work today. Thanks. - Ready? - Yes. Can I go ahead? �Claro! What a shame! I also brought breakfast. I have brought the food. It is such a short time that I am sorry to leave. I have an idea. Why don't we eat here? With pleasure. - You can go. - Well, see you at the office. S�. Hey, Nicol , wake up. �Anna? - Would you like another drink? - Thanks, but my head is spinning. The fisherman is the happiest person in the world. Also I, sometimes, I want to be one, two or three years away from life, ... in the middle of nature, with the sea always in front of you. - What about you? - I? I see the sea from my house. It is something else. Here the sea is beautiful because it is wild. - Are you happy, Anna? - I don't know. - I'm not happy. - And why? - What do you think of me? - You? You are a gentleman! �Y qu�? I've already told you. It's good, it has everything. I haven't eaten on the grass since I was a child! At heart I am sentimental. Will your mother say nothing if she is a little late? - No. You know I'm with you. - Yes! Guess what I have to eat! - Chicken. - No, try again. - Pie. - Do you think I'm a boy? Mire. I also have bread and an omelette. Why do you take it so long? Anna, wait! No! No, please! Leave me alone. I have struggled to resist. You don't know how much. But in the end I couldn't. And maybe I have fooled myself before you. He thought he was different. But in the end I behave like everyone else. Like the photographer, like the one with the Orione stockings. I once thought of getting a divorce. But I don't have the money to do it. Maybe I am a coward. I have no courage to leave my children. Is it fair that love is over for me? Why don't you speak? Why don't you say what I deserve? �Te ver� ma�ana? Conc! Anna is getting married! When? Tonight? No, they brought the furniture! Come see! But how? Like this, so suddenly? Has your mother guessed the pool right? No, the father plays Bonoloto. Pretty, huh? It looks like mahogany! Come see! She was in love, she insisted and I bought them for her! What do you want? You are young, it is your time! Hey, you're getting wet! Come, I'll take care of the furniture. Who is the groom? A young man of the first rank, a career midshipman. Yes, from the North, a refined person. - And where did you meet him? - They never talk about it. They are young, they come home and everything is settled. - Is it true? Are you getting married? - Yes. Good luck. With this marriage, many people will die of envy! Don Antonio, take it with philosophy! - Thanks. Close the door, huh? - Good evening. You like comedy, huh? Was it good? Just like you! "Engaged ... Not really." The sailor was not enough! Tell me, are you this? �Qu� verg�enza! �Qu� verg�enza! You could have been a princess and you've become a stocking model. It's crazy! Your parents have nothing to say in all this? Nann , answer, we are talking to you. No problem. Marry that sailor. At least we'll stop this whining. - What are you talking about? - Shut up. Do you know what we are going to do? A general pool. Come down, we will do it together. We say that the Anconetana wins for the love of the sailor? Go see what he's doing. �Nann�! �Nann�! Nann ! Nann ! What have you had? Iodine? I don't know. You better talk, we could do something. Are you going to say it, yes or no? Who was it? Say it! I don't want to stage a tragedy, just have it face to face. Forget it. Commissioner, let's not make a fuss. However you want. For me ... I'm done. - What do I wear, Commissioner? - Nothing, she is of legal age. Pap tambi n quer a come. But it is better that he went to work. - Pappaniello too. - But they'll come for you tonight. Nerd... - Caterina! - Excuse me, can I ask you a question? May I? How come you are here? I can't see it! Cater , do something. say... Tell him I'm wrong. That the doctors don't want. Is good. �Andrea! Andrea! Andrea, wait! You're not too bad, are you? Caterina had scared me. - Have you read the newspapers? - Yes, but I don't understand anything. I didn't want to see you. What happened? Why did you do that? I can't go on with you I am not the same one you met. �C�mo? What do you mean? So ... you didn't love me. I loved you, but everything has changed. When you are better we will speak more calmly. Closing time! Closing time! Go, Andrea, go. He brought you this. Do you see it? It is no longer possible. Closing time! Come on, let's close! The ship will leave soon. Good luck. Who will marry her now? There are many cuckolds in the world. Some will find. We also want to. �Nann�! - �Anna! - �Nann�! But why? I sold the furniture. With the money from the sale I lived a season, ... but the days went by and I couldn't find a job. There were times when he lost all courage. It's a nice room. S�. I progressed. I even have a bathroom. Remember that the month has already expired and I can't wait any longer. Tomorrow I pay him. Is good. Nann , listen. Don Antonio Percuoco always asks me about you. - I wanted your address. - That was left behind. I know what Don Antonio wants. - If you're hot, take off your coat. - No. Do you want an apple? - Well, an apple yes. - C gela. - Jesus, have another one! - I'm not hungry, it's just good. - Take off your coat! - No, no, no! You are engaged! Who is he? - Ven, Gennar . - uedPuedo? Go ahead, come in. Do you see it? Why don't you make a promise to San Pasquale? Can't solve your problem and want to put the others in? How can you walk arm in arm with San Pasquale? They all look at us. But you have to do something! He kept looking for work. To save money, I always took the subway. But that little money I had was running out. Then one night ... Seeing that man made my blood boil. He would have been able to kill. �Pap�! �Estoy aqu�! - Call them! Make them respect you! - Massimo! Massive! Couldn't you take the car? Did you have to make me come on the subway? Be careful, you're going to hurt them! All the anger was suddenly gone. That man with his family, sad and submissive, ... so different from the one I had ever known. I was very sorry. I came home desperate. I was beginning to sense what it meant not to have a lyre ... ... and always be alone. �Vamos? Do you want to go up? Three thousand, huh? Five thousand, let's... Well, keep walking! Five thousand lire. I would have lived with that for a week. A "yes" was enough. How easy it would have been! �C�mo est�s? - I'm fine, what about you? - Now very good! Can I offer you? Friend. All�. Gennarino, follow us. Please. Do you want them? Thanks. �Puedo? Chivalry first of all, don't you think? It's true... ... that walking is good. You are right. Yes, but after eating. It's been so long that I wanted to take a walk with you. I've seen you grow up, Anna. Please don't be shy. Lean harder. You are very light. I'm fine like this, thanks. Have you understood that I am being serious? What do you say to me? If you don't want to, with everything that has happened to him ... You're wrong. I have forgotten, it is all buried. You must not be in a hurry, Don Antonio. But I love you, Anna. And I want to get married. �Aceptas? �Gracias! I don't deserve you, but you won't regret it! You will never miss anything, never! Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you. Put me to the test! - Tell me! Now! What do you want? - Eat. - What? - Eat, I'm hungry! Oh, sorry! You're right, it's time to eat. �Vamos! �Ven! From that day on, I considered myself his fiancée. He was happy when he bragged about his wealth. In a few days he showed me everything he owned. Finally, he led me here. Hola, Pasquale. This is the new fishmonger I have rented. What do you say to me? Modesty aside, I have a gift for business. - Hey, Cicc! - Don Antonio, are you okay? - �Perfectamente! - �Simp�tico! This is Anna Zaccheo, my fiancee. - Pleasure. Keep it. - Nice to meet you. - What do you think? - A bonbon! You'll see how all of Naples goes to the wedding. - Bravo! - Friends and enemies! - Congratulations! - Thank you very much! - Adi�s. - Cu�date. See? I already announced the wedding. If you want, we'll do the paperwork tomorrow. Do you like it? It is very nice! This is all mine! I always dreamed of having a warehouse like this. Nann , everything mine is yours ... ... and all yours is mine. If I have a warehouse like this ... ... and I have you ... what more can I ask for? Ah, come on, come on! �Chico! Tot, take the ice! He was out of work. And it is almost family. With me you will go far. - Have you taken the tuna to your mother? - Yes. Don't forget it! Tuna for your mother every day. Bravo! Hey, Carmel, come here! You look like a whale! She is the director of my company, she takes care of everything. Carmel , Anna Zacchaeus, future exposure to me. - So? - Nice to meet you. She has to work, not a beauty like you. It would be an injustice. Don Antonio, excuse me ... At some point you have to settle down, right? Each one knows his own. Carmel , with Anna's permission, I have to talk to you for a moment. Come. Anna ... Pasquale, show him the new scales. Come on �C�mo est�s? Well. When are you coming home? I don't know. These are the scales. - Who is that? - The boss's girlfriend. There will be horns. Who was it? Take back what you said! Hey, hey! What happened? You must respect it! After me he commands! Get to work! Did you like the scales? And this is nothing! Come, I'll show you the American fridge. Having a car, do you ask for a carriage? My boss is rich ... ... and his girlfriend doesn't like cars. I want many children, at least one for each business. And they must look like you, not me. Wait, you're going to kill yourself! What are you doing? Come up, Don Antonio, it's not dangerous. Come on, Don Antonio, don't be afraid. �Madre m�a! They should do the stairs first! What the fuck! If I find out, I won't come. You must be patient. A house is built little by little. Here they can put a room for the children. Do you like it? - We'll put the bedroom here. - Agree. There is more space. We can put some nice curtains. Very well. S�game. Aquê iré la sala. There will be a lot of couches, you know, I have a lot of friends. You have to think when you build a house for your wife and children. I have a great idea. Tomorrow we go to your house ... ... and we make a triumphal entry as husband and wife. Don Antonio, are you sure you love me? Of course! Haven't you noticed? Jesus! Yes, he wants to get married, but he hasn't asked me what I think yet. �De qu�? Of all things in life. I have my ideas, a heart ... If a woman is beautiful on the outside, she is also beautiful on the inside! I've lost my mind for you You must be patient. I already told you that maybe in time I ... Yes, yes, but we are getting married. Listen, it's a good deal for you too. Yes, I know. I'm old. And I am not handsome. But I have four businesses and ... Business doesn't matter to me. I just want a house of mine. A quiet life, like all women. Bravo! So you have to be! - Excuse me. - No, please, please ... - No, not here, Don Antonio! - And where, then? Who knows how many times you have kissed the sailor and also the other! And with me ...? Sorry. It has escaped me. We have arrived. Please. - Do not bother. - No, please, I'll accompany you! Gennar, hit the coachman and give these guys something! Good evening. - Let me in. - Don't be a kid, Don Antonio. - I'm only up for two minutes. - No! Just two minutes! - I only need you to be happy. - I'm just a poor girl. Poor? You are rich! With those eyes, that mouth ... �Espera! �Anna! �D�jame! Why to them yes and no? I am like them. If they see us we will be ashamed. Let me stay! It's impossible, Don Antonio. But I'm marrying you! I'm taking you home tomorrow! No, I couldn't marry him just to have a husband. I tried everything to become fond of him, ... to convince myself that, in time, maybe I, like many women ... ... I would adapt and resign myself. But I realized that I couldn't give up love forever ... ... and that she would not make a good wife for this man. Hurry up! Hurry up! "Se ori e se orite", hoy comienza el the Italo-American festival. Bets for the next round will be closed in two minutes. Once again, we present the archers who are going to compete. Here is Miss Teresa Ferrari, registered with the number one. And now with number two, Anna Zaccheo! Et voil! After many days of despair and hunger, ... I was finally able to find another job. It was, as always, an unusual job. Like everyone I ever had ... but it was always better than nothing. And now we introduce you to Maria Grimaldi! "Se�ori e se�orite", las apuestas est�n cerradas. "Rien ne va plus", ... which means: what is inside is inside and what is outside is outside. The competition is about to begin. "Mademoiselle, please take your place." Boy, give him the bow.

Don't trust the sailor, he'll go away! Stay with us! The competition continues with number three! Can we hang out for a while? Alone. I'm going to see if they give me permission. I wanted to talk to you. The last time we parted in a bad way. Who told you was here? Caterina. Waiting. What ports have you been to? We have been to Greece. In Salonica. I once seemed to see you. From the trolley. - How long ago? - I'll do a month. Can not be. He was still traveling. The sailor I saw ... ... he was with a girl. It was not me. We haven't seen each other for so long ... ... that you hardly recognize me anymore. We saw very little of each other. S lo un d a. But it was nice. Like a little. �Est�s...? Are you engaged? �Yo? I already feel old. As if he had white hair. Do you think I have not suffered? �Algo m�s, se�or? When do you get licensed? Seven or eight days. - Shall we go? - As you like. - Waiter, the bill. - Right away. Are you still thinking of becoming a mechanic? I don't even know what I want to do. There was a time when you knew. It's all my fault. The past past. It must have been fate. Aqu� est�. No, you haven't eaten anything. D�jalo. Why do you want to pay? To open a workshop you will need a lot of money. # What spell is this? What spell is this? # # A mermaid has chained me ... # # ... and there is no escape for me. # # You have made a chain with seaweed. # # Get away, get away, if you can hear me, sailor. # # Because, what spell is this? What spell is this? # Since that time he had not come back. # Poor me, poor me! # �Fuego? - Thanks. - No problem. - Get here and I'll get there. - Why? Si�ntese. - I split his face? - Leave him alone. "Cummare e cummarelle"! "Cummare e cummarelle"! At the kind request of this beautiful lady ... ... we will sing once more "Cummare e cummarelle". Qu� bonita, �eh? # Not to show off, but I'm the king of the neighborhood. # # Girls and women are always around me. # # They open the windows if they see me go by. # # Even birds compete to sing ... # # ... because I'm always happy, always happy. # # Girls and women are beautiful, they are beautiful, # # ... but I love Stella, she is beautiful, she is beautiful. # # But to please all of them I don't let them pressure me. # # One here, one there. # # I take them all for a walk on the beach! # # Girls and women are beautiful, they are beautiful, # # ... but I love Stella, she is beautiful, she is beautiful. # Sing you too, sailor! # But to please all of them I don't let them pressure me. # # One here, one there. # # I take them all for a walk on the beach! # Why is everyone looking at you? You also looked at me once. Let's get out of here. What happens? I love Anna. And now that I've seen you again, I love you even more than before. What should I do? Andrea... - I love you too. - When I'm with you I forget everything. Lets go to other place. I have dreamed so many times that you came back. You are the only good person I have ever met. But the last time we met, he treated you badly. Yes, but you were right. Couldn't you choose another job, instead of target shooting? No, I have tried a thousand ways. All those men ... I don't know any of them. You don't believe me? Friend. American. Who smokes? - �Tienes fr�o? - No. How happy I am! Think, we have a lot of time to be together. Excuse me, do you have fire? Sailor, do you need a room? Clean, at a good price. Hey, take it easy! What did I say? It's late. It is better if I walk you home. If not, it's my fault you'll always have to lie. Not over there, over here. - How? Isn't it over there? - No. This is where I live. Why have you left your family? After what happened, I couldn't go back to my neighborhood. I'll keep you company for a bit. Give me to enter. So, friend. Give me your hand. It is better not to turn on the light. You don't like it, do you? It is a room like any other. I couldn't afford anything better. Its cheap. I would have liked to receive you in a palace. Are you tired? "Antonio Percuoco, mayorist". Who is it? We were dating, nothing serious ... I never gave him a kiss, but he hasn't given up. And then what? I quit because ... ... because he wanted me like a good company. Why were you his girlfriend? I was hungry. You should understand. You also became a sailor out of necessity. He wanted to marry me and I wanted to go back to being a girl like the others. I can not live without you. Andrea... You were leaving without even giving me a kiss. I didn't want to wake you up. It's late, I must go back to the port. I still can't believe it. I hadn't told you. I got to buy the bedroom furniture. I don't know how I will feel to see you dressed in civilian clothes. The clothes will be too small for me. Andrea... Will your family like it? Of course. Why not? A mechanic, at least at first, ... can work at home, without a license. So there are less expenses, don't you think? If we get married here in Naples, you'll see how much work you have. We will be lucky together for sure. Now sleep. Close your eyes. No, don't go! I'm going with you! I accompany you! - Will they put you in prison? - Of course. What about licensing? They'll give it to me anyway. It will be 5 or 6 days of punishment. It must be the last. About licensing ... I need to think about it. - There's something you're not telling me. - Wait, I have to be careful. Ah, here you are! Now they'll lock you up! - One minute please. - Yes, but don't let them see you. - What should I do? - Come and go, what do you want me to say? Come to the gate. I want to know everything. I do not want to talk. Expl�cate. There are things that one cannot erase from his head, try to understand it. That man, the one with the photographs ... Why were you there? You forgot. I've tried everything to forget it, but I couldn't, believe me. You know what happened. I've paid for everything, Andrea. Do you want to get me in trouble? I turn a blind eye, but they can see you from the boat. - Go see what happens. - Waiting. Makes you suffer, huh? With how beautiful you are. Anna. You don't love me, otherwise you would understand. I love you. You can't imagine how much. We all make mistakes. And with me, then, why did you go to bed? �C�mo? What do you mean? I don't mind sleeping with you. Because I love you. You shouldn't have! You should have fired me, like you did in the hospital! Why do I have to give up love? Why? A little more and you end up in Gaeta. Move! Don't you see how I am? Think about it. You would marry a man who would make you suffer for a lifetime. I don't mind suffering with you! But I want to get married to be at peace, ... to live in peace after so many years as a soldier. I would never hurt you! I've never done it to anyone! - More! - Think of the damage I have received! And what have I done? What is my fault? None. Things are like this. I am like everyone. Like my father, my brothers ... Do you see those? They are like that too. We are all the same. There are certain things that we cannot bear. You are right. Let us reflect. Let's think about it. Adi�s, Andrea. Anna ... Anna ... �Anna! What hips ... So beautiful and so sad, miss. Miss, what the ...! Miss! �Est� loca, se�orita? �Quieta! Sister ... Looks like ... Your room is as you left it. How many windows! How many girls like me! And even so, you don't have to get tired of living!
