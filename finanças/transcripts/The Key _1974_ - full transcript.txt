A Nikkatsu Presentation THE KEY I begin writing here the things I've never dared to tell her... ...about our intimate relations. Writing about my intimate relations with a woman is not at all shameful. The things I'll be putting on paper might hurt her. But she'll understand right away my meaning. She's of a very special woman beauty... ...that she hides behind a pretentious decency and an artificial refinement. I've just turned 56. That doesn't yet mean I'm going downwards. It's just our sexual relations are beginning to exhaust me. To be honest, I do it once a week. More exactly, once every ten days. Even if she doesn't have a strong heart, she takes it on well. The needs are pathologically intense. Our recent encounters, have left me so powerless, on the verge of losing my humanity. I understood her special side among the other women. She has an extremely rare organ. Had she been sold in a red-light district, like Shimabara, she'd have been famous. It's enough imagining her physique to get my jealousy aroused. I'm sorry. Sir... They're here. Thank you for waiting. If another man would be aware of her perfection... Next one, please! This thought makes me uncomfortable. Not raising up to her physical perfection. The reproaches I'm saying to myself are unbearable. Please... Come... Come now, I beg you. When I shut my eyes and she kisses my eyelashes... ...I feel an intense pleasure. Go on. I know she likes to be kissed on her armpits. Please, stop. That wouldn't do. I adore watching your armpits. Please, stop! Tomorrow night we'll be celebrating New Year. My wife loves traditions. She won't forget organizing a proper celebration. I'm ashamed to so confess on this new year beginning, but I have to. My wife knows me. I have a foot fetish. No, that's dirty. Not at all! These are your feet - You know I love them. - You mustn't. - It's not decent. - I'm asking you. Let yourself go. I am a decent woman. They have a wonderful shape. That's gross... One shouldn't touch those parts. Please, stop... Please, shut off the light. Who cares? I love you above anything else. Please, shut it off! She stubbornly clings to her womanly pleasure. I can't fulfill her exigences any longer. I'm worn out. I see myself weakening. You still aren't satisfied. Stop making excuses. Still... ...you have so much stamina. You'll do it tomorrow. Your libido makes you too demanding. That's not true. That's not how I am. That's the truth. If you'd show more passion, I wouldn't have any problem. Don't blame me. You've never skipped one of my invitations. You scare me with your needs. I am not letting you see my passions. All you are interested in is your own pleasure. And the way you do it, too... ...is way too routinely. Too traditional. Too formalistic. Devoided of all surprise. For the usual stuff, you are passive... ...very laid back. And in bed... ...you become insatiable. We've been married for 20 years and... ...it's always the same reactions. Always the same posture. That can't satisfy. There, always the routine. And still, with your lust... ...so often repeated... ...you totally scare me. Obsessed by your senses.. ...you are like a gourmand waiting. You don't love me half as much as I love you. I am just an utilitarian object for you. And besides, you think I am not perfect. I don't want to. You should rather make the offer to my mother, not to me. Madam, please. Here's my glass. Ikuko, you are not used to this. You are drinking more than we use to. It's the first time you've drunk so much. It goes well with the salmon roe. I'm honored you like it. But we, men, we know when we must stop. Kimura, you know not to exaggerate. Thank you. That's not how I let people see me. But with Mr. Kimura near... You risk committing a blunder. If you'll excuse me. Good night. Alright, I'll be leaving, then. Won't you stay a little longer? Let's continue this nice moment. It's the first time we've had the opportunity. Alright. I'm jealous on him and accepting this exacerbates my passion. I need this jealousy to go further in our room. Here. I know how important being jealous of Kimura is. That's how I manage to satisfy my wife. I'll go to sleep now. Excuse me. What's the matter with her? Don't worry. She has her moods. It's my fault. I feel emptied. It becomes embarrassing. What are your intentions with my daughter? Can I hope? What do you feel for her? Of course, if your daughter consents to this marriage. I am ready. I totally approve you. Otherwise, you risk falling in love with her mother. Not at all. Your wife should have been back by now. I'll go see. My wife is a John Lennon fan. And Kimura. He looks like John Lennon. Miss? Please, come, because it's strange. What's the matter? It's puzzling. I don't seem to be able to find your mother anywhere. My wife is always watching over these two people. As a matter of fact, I think she's in love with Kimura. Professor, your wife was taken ill in the bathroom. Mother... Mother, aren't you feeling well? Mother, you can't sleep in here. Mother? I'll make her bed, anyway. - Help me, will you? - Of course. - We have to dry her quickly. - Yes. - Otherwise, she'll be sick. - Yes. In these circumstances I didn't forget to use Kimura. Kimura... I forced him to help me. I watched him attentively. - Dry her arms on the inside. - Yes. I'll put a hot water bottle in her bed. It's really strange. There's no cerebral hemorrhage. Don't worry. - Good night. - Thank you. Knowing her personality, I was wondering... ...if she was really asleep... ...or was faking it. I wasn't at all sure. Even if she faked it... that didn't mean anything to me. A lot of husbands know everything about their wives' body... ...down to the smallest detail, to the number of wrinkles on their soles. My wife has never wanted to reveal herself to me. Even when we lost ourselves to each other, I've never seen her naked. I am overwhelmed. A husband who is offered the surprise, after 20 years of common life... ...to discover his wife's beauty... ...to see the purity of her complexion. It feels like he's entering into a new marriage. She looked like waking up. Actually, coming round, would confuse her. She'd be very embarrassed to have revealed herself in her nakedness. She'd find it difficult to pretend she isn't conscious. Kimura! Kimura! Kimura! I'm sure she's said "Kimura". Will she always seem to be wanting to sleep with Kimura and to end my obscene games? Or tell me: "if only it could be like this with Kimura." I do wonder what she wanted to make me understand. - Have the bath ready for the next days. - Yes Welcome home, sir. I have to go to sleep. Excuse-me... We were very pleased by your visit. It's a pleasure seeing you go. - It's fine. - Yes. Kimura... You can go leave. We're okay! What a lewd geezer! What a lewd hag! Kimura... Kimura... The most extraordinary thing is that... ...my wife said the same incoherent words. But, again, the name "Kimura"... ...got out of her moth last night. Please, let me leave the house. What's wrong? When do you want to leave? To go where? I'd like to study. At my French teacher's beginning next week. So I could help her with her sick husband. Are you sure? Talk to your father. If your father agrees... ...I will too. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Have you bought a Polaroid? Yes. Shall we have some tea? With pleasure. I've asked him what his feelings are for my mother. Kimura gave no answer. I can only imagine them. Professor, I've borrowed a Polaroid camera from a colleague. Would you want to try it? - Do you advise me to? - Yes. I am happy to have a camera lent to me. Has Kimura guessed my intentions? Will you go shopping? I will. Mother? I am moving out today. Already? Mother, father will kill you. Why are you saying that? Deep inside myself... ...I have no intention of marrying that girl. May I? I've brought you the camera. I'll put it here. Perfect! Since Toshiko left... ...there's no reason for me to trouble you. But the professor called and was insistent. Kimura... We see you already as part of our family. Not yet. I want it as soon as possible. I am happy you've dropped by. - Thanks for coming. - Anything to help you. My first goal with these photos... ...is the pleasure I have from taking them. Secondly... ...putting these photos in my diary... ...so that my wife sees them for certain. My third reason is that, this way, my wife... ...will understand the pleasure I take in contemplating our naked bodies. She'll be touched to know... ...that her nakedness bewitches me. I heard my wife saying Kimura's name three more times during those days. The most important goal remains... ...offending her modesty in the highest degree... ...to see until which point... ...is she able to fake sleeping. Forgive me. I try being a good wife. I have to obey my husband's orders. I've been taught it's my duty, however repugnant I find it. Everything will be alright. I'll take care of it. You can go. Good night! What an old geezer! Kimura... Right now, when I stay at home, my wife doesn't go out much. It's not good for her. Take her out to the movies on Sunday. Thanks in advance. - We'll be leaving now. - Alright. I guess my daughter is thinking: "I'll sacrifice myself for mother" or "I'll keep her company". - Do you think the same? - No. It is obvious my wife has feelings for Kimura. But I can't know the truth about his. It's a plus not having to develop these photos. But I prefer a classical camera. Could you deal with them at your place? Why shouldn't I develop them at your place? Kimura must suspect the content of the photos. Kimura, I don't want them developed at home. I don't understand what you mean. Kimura... You know what photos I'm talking about. I am not a professional. I have no other solution. Alright... I'll develop them. - Shall I come for the negatives? - Yes. Please, buy some sak√© too. Can you go back home? If my wife reads this diary. My beloved wife could think I am lying. I've come to learn to use this stimulant called Kimura. Even if I feel that it's hastening my end. In the meantime I must thank Kimura. I feel myself besieged by extraordinary desires. This passion rests on my jealousy of Kimura. And on the sight of my wife's naked body... ...my sexual drive accelerates. This ecstasy... ...can't last long and will soon enough lead me to my demise. What happened to you? Nothing... it's gone. Darling... - I'm worrying about your future. - You shouldn't. Could it be that your present stamina was an error? Now, when I am blooming? If I am not wrong, I could help you. Stay calm. I can't but admit the happiness I feel, night after night... ...finding myself immersed in an ecstasy that, before, I couldn't even have dreamed of. This happiness can't go on forever. I've touched my limits. I am scared of sickness. I can no longer stop. Mother. I'd like to speak to you. About what? Yesterday, at Kimura's... ...I've seen some photos. What photos? Mother. Come what may, I am on your side. Tell me the truth. I dropped by Kimura's, yesterday... ...because he had promised to lend me a French book. As I said... ...Kimura was absent but I came in. I took this book from his bookshelf. Inside there were some small photos. Mother! What does that mean? There's something I don't understand. What are you hiding from me? Well. What can I say? If there are photos with me in shameful circumstances... ...I've been ignoring the fact until you told me about it. If these photos exist... ...they were taken by your father while I was asleep. Kimura only developed them at his request. Between me and Kimura... ...there is no relation. Why did your father make me sleep? Why did he take such photos? Why did he give them to Kimura to develop? I leave those answers to you. It's very hard for a mother to talk to her daughter about such things. I won't say more. All I did was obey my husband's orders. I think it's my duty as a wife to be loyal to your father, no matter where that might lead me. That's why... Please, believe me. I did it out of duty, even if it was against my wishes. You might find it difficult to understand. But, brought up traditionally, I can't do otherwise. If a naked photo of your mother makes your father so happy... ...your mother will model, notwithstanding her shame. Mother? Are you serious? I am! I despise you, mother. Mother... You are the role model for a virtuous woman. But why did father ask Kimura to develop the photos? I don't understand it too well. He tried to humiliate you. Is that really so? He's solely torturing Kimura. Toshiko... My girl, you shouldn't get involved in such things. Your father still loves me passionately. Taking photos of my naked body. He must have wanted to make sure through another man that... ...notwithstanding the years, my body had remained young and beautiful These sentiments might have something morbid... ...but I've ended up understanding him. But, I'm wandering, if that's all he wants. Father knows very well what Kimura thinks of you. Then, he does a bad thing. Kimura loves you. It's sure only inadvertently... Kimura must be thinking about something. Nobody leaves such photos carelessly laying in a book. He wanted me to see them and tell you about them. I think he's obsessed by you. That's what Kimura wanted me to understand. I've said nothing until now. I've asked her if she had a photo with me and my husband having sex. I almost thought he had told Kimura. She must be secretly in love with Kimura. So... ...I've understood she became hostile towards me. And here we are, thank you! I thought my wife had left to meet Toshiko. Has Kimura gone with them? - Good evening. - Please. Have you bought cognac? I don't know. When I came back, I found this bottle. I thought Kimura had taken care of it. It was not me. It surely must be the Professor. It can't be anyone else. It's a very meaningful joke. If it's Dad, let's treat ourselves. It wasn't you, was it? No, I wouldn't lie to you. Will you give us a brandy? - It's the first time. - I think so. For you, mother. Thanks! It's too late for going to the cinema. I'll be right back. Mother, I'll set the bath today. Kimura! Father, can you come? Where? Sekiden-Cho. Mother fell in the bathroom in Sekiden-Cho. Should I get the doctor? Who is with her? Kimura's at her side. I'll explain later. I think she needs an injection quickly. Father, if you can't come, I'll call doctor Soma. No need to bother, I'll do it. You can? Have you left them alone? I looked 30 minutes for a taxi. My wife was sleeping peacefully. She only had her shirt on. I noticed her hair was loose, hanging in disarray, wet. When she fell at home, her hair was in order. That is, maybe, the way Kimura likes it? Forgive me the trouble. When she fell in the bathroom, I brought her here with your daughter. Should we let her sleep here? I'll take her back. I'll carry her. Kimurra... Professor, you should trust me about what happened tonight. Your daughter knew everything. - Can I leave? - Yes, thank you. And Toshiko? She has already left. Good night. Seeing the circumstances, Toshiko must have been the instigator. Is she in love with him? She must've dawdled even more pretending she had difficulties finding a taxi. Kimura... Kimura... I must have left them alone almost an hour. What happened in that room? Anything could have happened between Ikuko and Kimura. I could see everything. I became extremely jealous. Ikuko wasn't stammering any more. It was a groan, a shout, a passionate call. Kimura... In one night my wife changed, becoming very bold. When I ask if it was Kimura who changed her into a lascivious and eager woman... ...I resent that violently. But I'm also grateful. Kimura! Kimura! Kimura! Kimura! Kimura! In that moment, I felt like entering into a parallel universe. I saw myself up to the seventh heaven. All past is but an illusion. That was the real life. My wife and I... ...were totally embraced. I was, maybe, going to die, but I'd live for ever. I was on the lookout, but, little by little, I relaxed. My suspicion was disappearing. Between Kimura and Toshiko, I didn't know... ...if everything had been decided beforehand. Still... ...I can't deny... ...I was waiting what would happen, hoping it. Your cerebral arteriosclerosis provokes dizziness... ...and you risk losing consciousness if it gets worse. You have drunk and injected too much hormonal drugs. You should rather take medicine too lower your blood pressure. As for the bed, I advise you to abstain yourself. Well... I have to tell you the truth. In fact, your blood pressure is so high, it couldn't be measured. You must stop working and rest totally. Three months have gone by since New Year. I am astonished by my resistance in this match, with my wife with so ardent desires. I hope she'll understand how much I love her. Will she be impressed? Will she see the truth through these written words? I am sure she will now. But what will happen then? How will I be able to satisfy her lust even better? I don't doubt my wife's fidelity. I placed them in a situation where adultery is unavoidable. What shop is she going in? Is it to please Kimura? I was waiting for you. Come in! Ikuko's behavior is changing every day. Almost every day, she goes out alone in the afternoons. She's absent for more than four hours. She comes back for dinner in the evening. She must be meeting Kimura somewhere. Darling? I'm going out. I'll be back in the evening. Toshiko is here. If you want, you can eat together. What about you? I'll have dinner too. But, if you want to wait for me... ...we'll have dinner together. I'll have dinner earlier. You can go out for dinner. Take your time. It doesn't bother me. The Professor wasn't satisfied with the Polaroid. For a better quality, he preferred using his reflex... ...to make pictures of every part of your body. But, what he really wanted, was to torment me. He asked me to develop them just to excite me even more. I had to put up with everything without yielding to temptation. Seeing my sentiments mirrored in you... ...knowing you were suffering as much. All this fills me with joy. At my age, I can't reproach you exquisite things I who climb down the mountain with my Shimosaka sword. Are you still there? You know I can have dinner on my own. Mother said I could keep you company for once. I seldom have dinner without your mother. Your presence increases the sensation of void. Really? Dad. Do you know where mother went? Do you hear me? I don't know such a thing. And I don't want to know. Mother is in Hamaotsu. In Hamaotsu? Yes, it's possible. From Sanj≈ç Station... ...you get to Hamaotsu in 20 minutes with an express train. 50 minutes walking distance from there... There's a hotel there. Do you want to know the details? I don't want to hear anything about such things. How did you find out? It's I who told him about that place. Because in Kyoto, one can see you easily. There are places not far away from Kyoto. At least that's what Kimura asked me. Dad. Do you want some? Not intending to butt in... ...but what do you think, father? What do I think? What do you mean? When mother will say she isn't cheating on you... ...will you still trust her? Have you told your mother about this? Mother didn't tell me anything. It's Kimura who did. He told me that mother... ...was still being faithful to you. At least, that's what he said. I can't be made to believe... ...such nonsense. Believe it or not, that's your problem. But you, father? I still trust Ikuko. Even if I was told Kimura dishonored Ikuko, I wouldn't believe it. Ikuko is a woman who can't cheat on me. Admitting she wasn't dishonored... ...there are worse ways of being defiled... ...if mother felt any pleasure. Shut up, Toshiko! Enough with these impertinences! There are things you can say to your parents, and others you can't. You must be scum to say something like this. I don't need you. Get lost! I am leaving. Has Ikuko given herself entirely to Kimura? That's what I am afraid of. Did Ikuko use Toshiko as a go-between? Did she put the words in Toshiko's mouth? And what I wrote in my diary... ...I'm now thinking about it. "She has an extremely rare organ." I shouldn't have written that. She has probably read this diary. How long did she resist the possibility of trying her physiological qualities... ...with a man other than her husband? It was nine in the morning when my wife got back home. My beloved wife. I feel my mind is going away. Since New Year... ...I've abandoned everything... ...so I could devote myself only to our pleasure. I'm totally obsessed by it. Sexual desire it's all I am now. Nothing else comes to my mind. Lying in bed, I am not able to do anything else. I daydream. I am sorry I'm intruding. You'll be fashionable now. I'll put on these European clothes. Forgive me for disturbing you. I'll be going now. It suits you great! It was the first time I saw her in this perspective. She only used accessories with Japanese clothes. So, it was only a rehearsal. I've tasted all your woman's body... ...except the most important part. You have reached the peek of your fidelity to the professor. Your body thanks me totally. But it refuses the irreparable. But, I'm getting near to the woman. I will relax your erotic nerves. I know the technique very well. I'll heal you in three sessions. Starting tomorrow, you'll be very excited. Ikuko, what are you thinking of? Nothing special. I understand. You're thinking about the professor. I saw his face. I wanted to drive it away with all my forces. I don't know why... ...but I was also thinking about him. Bring us what's left. Sorry. My darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling. Darling. Darling! Darling! Darling. Darling... I can't die without being sorry for my wife. It's for her that I staged all these situations. Certainly... ...after my death... ...what my beloved wife will do... ...I wouldn't like to see it with my own eyes. Ikuko, we are living together, the three of us. In order to keep up appearances... ...it's better if I marry your daughter. Please, do that. THE END
