I remember this house, many years ago when you were a little girl and I was already an old man. Hey, why would you say that? I'm the one who is old! You haven't changed at all. The house hasn't changed, to be more precise! Ah, yes! What is this? You think you're iceberg-deep, but you're actually just as cold as ice. You're nowhere. You don't exist. You're not ready to speak the first word, let alone put on the whole play. I don't ask you to become people from a century ago, but you guys can't even concentrate! You don't exist at all. You are null, zero, nothing! Let's go again. Roman Petrovich. Please meet our new, contemporary director. Khachatryan. We've met. Roman Petrovich, you've been rehearsing for six months. We produce three shows in this time. Not deep, pretentious plays but profitable, audience-friendly shows. Think how much you have lost us, Russia's National Theatre… Should you continue working here, how do you think? Are you implying that I am fired? It's nice to talk to an intelligent person. A. CHEKHOV MY CHEKHOV KHACHATRYAN'S NEWEST PRODUCTION ONE YEAR LATER Hello. Hello. Hello. Excuse me, I'm looking for this guy. Has he been here? Are you going to order a coffee? I can… - What's your name? - Why do you ask? So we don't mix up your order. Irina. A coffee for Irina. He's never given his name. He brings his own thermos of coffee. He doesn't buy anything, nicks our sugar and reads his book. That's him! Can I leave him a note in case he comes back? Who is he anyway? Who are you? I'm a wolf. Guys, stop. Let's think about why she asks who he is? She can see that for herself. Maybe because you want him to say it? To admit to himself that he is a wolf? Well, OK. And you? Why so quick to reply? Think about who you are first. Think. Don't try to put it on, think for real! There! Pause. Fire! Roman Petrovich. I don't know how to say this… Some of the parents are a little unhappy… By "some" and "a little" you mean "all" and "very"? Roman Petrovich, you're such an intelligent person! Are you implying that I am fired? - Can I take this? - Not yet. I'm still drinking. Somebody left you a message. Roman Petrovich, it's awful at the theatre without you. Come by tomorrow. The production is nothing special, but I'm good in it, I think. Yours, Irina. Roman Petrovich! - I'm so glad you resurfaced! - Hello. He's here for me. Can you let him through? Your passport. Roma, hi! Roman Petrovich, we still think about you! I remember this house, many years ago… when you were a girl and I was already an old man. Hey, why would you say that? I'm the one who is old! You haven't changed at all. Look! One sec. This is… …a star. Because I am a star! And this is a cat, because I am a cat. This is a peace sign, because I am a pacifist. And this is just a point, because I am the starting point! Is everything OK? It's all awful. It's all bad. The acting, the directing… It's all terrible from beginning to end. I'm sure you'd have put on a better play. It's pornography. I'd never have taken it on. - Unfortunately, Roman… - Petrovich. We can't lend you any more money. What about a 1000 rubles? You have no job… 800? Roman Petrovich, please come through. Our repertoire is set for the season. Hello. We're already working on several pieces now. From the young directors, we have Khachatryan doing one of the classics. Who? I haven't read it myself, I'm so busy, but it's something very funny. The lord of the manor turns up, something happens, he leaves. A folk story. - Roman… - Petrovich. Roman Petrovich, sadly, our repertoire for the season is set. Khachatryan will put on Chekhov. Who will? Khachatryan. Chekhov? Yes. A very unusual production. It's an exclusive premiere, just for us. Roma, I'll be honest, we don't have anything for you now. Do you know who our sponsors have asked for? - Khachatryan? - How did you guess? So you see the kind of humor they're after. I get it. Come by when Khachatryan is finished. Hello. Are you going to order a coffee? You can't drink from your thermos here. How many milliliters is your espresso? About this much. Do you have chicory coffee? No, but we do have security. Mate! Mate! Can I make a call from your phone, mate? Mate, I need to make a call! It doesn't work. Maybe it's out of credit? Top up your phone, mate! Top up your phone, mate! Hey, mate! Can I make a call? Here. Everything's fine. Breathe. Deeper. Thanks. So have you seen Stepanov? Where is he now? I haven't seen him since drama school. What about Khachatryan? Tell me about yourself. Me? I… I'm not in theatre. I'm making videos. Short clips and things. Hey… So lucky that I bumped into you! A gift of fate! Look, tomorrow I've got some TV work. Can you cover for me at my side job? It's easy, especially for a brilliant director like you. You can make anything into a great work. I only work in theatre. I've never worked with a camera. It's no big deal, you've got the cameraman for that. You really don't need to do anything. It's just basic stuff. Remember how film works. Go to the cinema today… I only watch films about the Holocaust. Got it? Yeah, but you need money, right? What's the genre? But it's… EROTICA NUDE PAINTINGS PLUMBER MOSCOW - Hi. I'm… - Andrei sent you? Come in. Thanks. This is Nikita, our cameraman. Roman. Nikita. Nikita, there are more condoms by the jam. Viagra is in the drawer. Eat the cake. Right, I'm off. Bye! - Nice to meet you! - And you! Bye. - I'll just finish this. - Sure. Where are the actors? In the bedroom. I'll go and introduce myself. What are their names? Lera and a new guy. I don't remember his name. Could be Marat. Or maybe not. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Roman Petrovich. - I'm Lera. Timur. Let's start, shall we? Yes. Just a sec. Nikita is having cake. It was my birthday yesterday. That's fine, we'll start without him for now. Are we starting with the table? Of course! How else? Just the three of us, you and I. Three of us? I didn't sign up to any hardcore! Please take a seat. I printed out the script. But… Take a seat. Let's start by just reading the text, without any acting. Please, go ahead. Oh! Hello. You're here at last. You've got a leak? Where is it wet? It's all wet. That's the end of the text. Here you move to the sink… What's the key thing here? I'll rephrase my question. Why the attraction? Why today? They lived their own lives up to now, perhaps passing each other on the stairs! What happened to them this morning to set off this spark? Is this, like, a rehearsal? Well… - Coz' I'm in the mood for it. - For what? Let's understand what exactly. Well… And when you say "I", who is this "I"? Lera the actress or your character? I don't know. Let's take a closer look at what the author wrote. Lera is an architecture student. - That's actually quite a good outfit. - Thank you. So why did she want love this very morning? I don't know. What year is she in? What style of architecture does she prefer? I don't know. What's your line of action? Timur… Well, I come in and walk towards the radiator. OK. It's easier for me to show you. No! You've got to understand what you're doing first. OK, so I come in and she is standing there. Right… She's, like, bending over to show where it's wet. - OK. - Yes. - And then I start… - Right! Let's rewind a little. What mood are you in? Is it morning or evening? - Now or in the plot? - In the plot. Morning. Your first call out. You're full of energy. And here is this girl. What do you feel? I'll rephrase my question. How is she different from thousands of other girls? Why do you feel something for this particular girl? - Do I need to answer now? - You can think about it. - Look. - What if she… Look at me… You've got a leak? Where is it wet? - Should I say something? - Your line. - Where is it wet? - It's all wet. OK. Do you call for a plumber every day? In real life, I mean. - No. - Correct. Once in a blue moon. And then he arrives. And you immediately fall in love with him? Well… He's young, he's got a six-pack and I'm, like, horny. Who is "I"? Let's have another look at what the author says. She's an architecture student. An educated girl working towards her goals. You think she starts feeling horny, just like that? - Can I ask a question? - Yes. Why does she put out right away, if she is so well-educated? Well, let's ask her! What? We are… …catastrophically incapable of being happy. We don't see what we have as love. We live in a state of permanent expectation. We wait and we wait… We get married… Then we get divorced… Because it seems so unfair… We wait for love. Then we think we've found it! But even with this real person by our side, we are still waiting for love. So tell me. If the sink hadn't broken, for example, but a light bulb had blown and an electrician had come instead, would this have happened between the two of you? Would there have been a spark? - Yes, an electric spark. - Right! You get the metaphor! There would have been a current between you. And there's a current because he's an electrician. - You get the metaphor, right? - Yes. But a current takes time to build up. Maximum, you'd agree to meet up later. But this happened instantaneously! A plumber… It's no coincidence! Like, an association? What happened to the pipe? - What? - What? It burst! It's no coincidence the author thought of a plumber. It burst! And this thirst for love right now made them both forget about everything. About their different social status, or any awkward feelings. You need to build all this up before acting out the scene. - Let's give it a go. - OK. The doorbell rings! You come in. Go on! The doorbell… You… Right. Oh, hi. You're here at last. You don't need to act, it's just a simple hello. And then you see each other… - Where is it wet? - Too early! Too early! You need to see her first. You freeze. Your whole life is on one side of the scales and this student is on the other! I want to see your whole life in your eyes! How old is the plumber? - 25. - What did he eat for breakfast? Cake. - What's plumber's mother's name? - Linara Abdulkharisovna. - And his father is Salam Lukmanovich. - What football team does he support? - He supported… - Sorry. - He supported Rubin. - You need to keep all this inside! Now go for it… your line! Where is it wet? What's my mother's name? Nina Antonovna. - Breakfast? - Cake. Style of architecture? Empire? Your line? Where is it wet? It is all wet! Back of the net! What's this table doing here? Come on… - Where does the radiator go? - Put it in the corner over there. Right, let's start. Don't splash anything! Action! Oh! Hello. You're here at last. You've got a leak? Where is it wet? It's all wet. Deeper! Deeper! I hope I didn't let you down too much. Are you crazy? The boss called. He wants you to make a big budget video. What's the feedback? Apparently, the boss cried! I'm glad my deep approach stirred someone's heart. Are you joking? I watched it with my wife. It's mind-blowing. It's like Tarkovsky, but interesting! So, now to a new video? With a real budget! Do you think I should give it a try? I think it's time for you to start, at last. I read up a bit on this era. - It could be helpful. - Excellent. It turns out, we Russians invented the steam locomotive. Yes. Let's have a look at the text. Hey, serf girl! Who do you belong to? No one. Your bucket's leaking. Is your dress wet? It's all wet. - Is that it? - Yes. Let's see it in action. Hey, serf girl! Who do you belong to? No one. Let's stop here. - Have you created your characters? - Yes. My name is Aristarkh, I'm from an old, noble family. I was born in Taganrog. What did you enjoy doing as a child? Gazing at the sunset, listening to the twitter of birds, and whipping serfs. Actually, I think I've become a sadomasochist from whipping serfs. Possibly. Lera? - Should I speak now? - Yes. I came up with something too. My name is Marfa and I love Arkhip the smithy. But I'm supposed to marry Father Innokenty. Stop! You've gone too far already. Inter-class marriages weren't allowed at that time. But it's an interesting idea. You're attracted to the common man and are opposed to the yoke of the Church. One more thing: I'm… I'm coming from the river now, where some men were swimming naked. So what do the buckets symbolize? What? - It's the association? - Yes. Maybe it's her innocence? - Innocence? - Interesting… - So you are carrying your innocence… - Yes. And what's key here? Maybe she… - Not to splash anything? - Right! Yes. Behind you is the river and those naked men. In front of you is this sadomasochist from Taganrog, and your innocence is… here it is… irreplaceable and fragile. And then there's that Father Innokenty too! And you tell everyone that you don't belong to anyone! What does that mean? - Feminism? - Of course! Every man thinks that a woman is an object. Just an object he wants to possess. And preferably to be the first one to possess her. - But I am not an object. - Nobody loves you, they just want to boost their self-esteem. But there's no other way. You have to give these buckets to someone! Why not pour out the water? Right onto the grass, so no one will take the innocence. I'll film it just like that. It will be quite beautiful. Perfect! You part with your innocence and tears rise up from inside, right from your stomach, like in life's most desperate moments. I can think back to when my cat died. Sure. Think about how your cat died. OK? So when I say "your bucket's leaking", it means her innocence is leaking away? Let's try it! Hey, serf girl! Who do you belong to? No one. Your bucket's leaking. Is your dress wet? It is all wet! And now move towards her, look at her, and we're off! People can't always be together Love can't blaze without a trace Tell me, then what's the point of love? Why do we love each other? Counting the days Burning our hearts The miracle of one true love Yet this love should blaze without a trace Tell me how… We could know at a first sight That we are each other's love and fate Damn! What? I really could've acted better if the horse hadn't started neighing. It's fine. We've got takes where it wasn't neighing. - Are you sure? - Yes. They're beautiful. Tell me how long we had to wander Through misty worlds To find each other, you and I What if fate should make us part Make us part again? Under starlight On the edge of the world Have you read Jack London's Love of Life? Hi. Sorry, we're rehearsing today. - Looks like it'll continue till night. - No big deal. - Is that OK? - No big deal. Alright… I'm off. Thanks. Today you got it deep and on point. Really? Yes. I started reading Chekhov. Maybe we can meet sometime and go over it? Can we? If you'd find it interesting. You're a very interesting person to be around. Bye. Roman Petrovich… Just a moment… Roman Petrovich. The boss… Our boss is a very serious person. Of course. And you are also a very serious person. And so we're talking about a fairly serious offer. Why "fairly" serious? Sorry? You said he is a very serious person and that I am a very serious person. But the offer isn't "very serious", only "fairly". Just a linguistic question. The boss wants to speak to you. Of course. Roman Petrovich, even we don't have his phone number. But we've received instructions. Tomorrow morning you go to St. Petersburg. Go up the Nevsky Avenue until you hit the Neva River. Keep going until you get to this bridge. - This one? - No. This one. I haven't been to St. Petersburg for ages. Don't get distracted. Hey, where are you going? It's Pushkin's apartment. One sec! Now cross the bridge and go into the building. Go to the Russian art room. I haven't been to the Hermitage for years. Go to the Russian art room. Roman Petrovich, go to the Russian art room. - Our boss… - How do I recognize him? They'll approach you. Should I hold something? Hold yourself together. They'll approach you. Look closely at the peasant girl's sensual yet spiritual expression. Is this why our most exported product has always been the mysterious Russian soul? Roman Petrovich… You and I will conquer the whole world. Thanks. First, I ran a presidential state project, but there wasn't any money in it. Then I created my own messaging app. I made money, but they shut it down. And now porn? Yes, there's a lot of money in porn. I've already made millions. But I need billions to be able to spend them easily. - They're watching you? - They're watching everyone. How do you like the weather? Changeable, like in Berlin. Sometimes rainy, sometimes sunny. Yes, sure. It's hard to find a veggie kebab in St. Petersburg. Hi, mum. Yes, I got here just fine. Can I call you back after I've been to the Hermitage? Bye! The West hasn't received anything deep from us for over 100 years. Chekhov, Dostoevsky… Now you. Everyone is used to the ordinary porn. But you've created a new genre: "deep porn". Me? Created a new genre? When my grandma and I first saw your porn, I knew it immediately. It's bigger than any start-up, or a messenger. When the secret police forced Pasha to pull his app, he fell into a serious depression. This soup is very good. I like it too. - What's important in sex… - Yes. - Grandma, why are you interrupting me? - I'm not. I'm agreeing with you. Your agreeing sounds very much like interrupting! What was I saying? - What is important in sex. - Right. Of course, I can only theorize at this point… But look at my data… Rome, Paris, London, New York… The whole world wants depth from sex. We'll give them depth and take billions of dollars in return. - Via YouTube? - Yes. I also have YouTube… I'll handle that. You are an incredible Russian director, Roman. Just make films and don't be afraid of anything! What's there for a director to be afraid of in Russia? NEW YORK PARIS BERLIN And now the cultural news. Shortly before his Paris tour, the top director of Russia's National Theatre was hospitalized. He is currently here in the hospital. His heart couldn't withstand the pressure of rehearsals. But we are all praying for him and crossing our fingers. Let's leave the doctors to their work. REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOURCE, CLOSE TO THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION However, our information is somewhat different. Let's hear what our sources have to say. THE HOSPITAL'S CHIEF RESUSCITATOR Elderly people shouldn't watch these videos. Sure, everyone's watching this porn, even me. It's like reading a good book. But really, you'd better not. I've come to see my teacher, my boss, a person with a spotless reputation. This is all so unfair. As an artist, he was always open to new trends. And it's these new trends that brought him down. We hope that this great theatrical figure soon recovers from the effects of the deep Russian porn. It looks like his Paris tour won't go ahead. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you watching the news? - No… Yes… Russian depth is conquering the world. - Thank you. - Millions of views. Thank you very much, Mr President. Real views, not fake! - I haven't watched it, but… - Such a talented person should work for the interests of the state. We need to speak to him about his future. Yes. Apparently, he's not very… He's not very communicative. That can be fixed. Excuse me, are there any mushrooms here? If you are here, there must be. But I am hunting. Do you want to try it? I am a pacifist. I'm not offering you to shoot people. These are ducks. I'm a vegetarian. I'm not offering you to eat them. - I feel sorry for the ducks. - I understand. As a head of state, I am extremely busy. But I've heard a lot about your incredible deep porn. Thank you. And now you can use your great talent to help your Motherland. - I just make porn. - Not just any porn, but deep porn! I'm worried that there are those more deserving than me. Don't be. You aim, you fire, and the duck falls. Do you think you killed it? No, you just pulled the trigger. The bullet just took flight and the duck just happened to be in its path. Otherwise, in our work, you'll be bogged down by worry. Tea? How are your actors doing? Timur, Lera? I'm a fan of their work. - Thank you. They are doing fine. - That's good. This is what I think: Being a sex addict makes you a good citizen. You know what to expect from a sex addict. But look at everyone else. They are totally unpredictable. Yours is a special mission. You can use art to relax morals and make a human being out of an animal. I've been reading Chekhov… What I want to say is… You need to move up a level. To the level that you deserve. You are a hero of our time. You are ahead of your time. Hey mate! You walk your own path and you do it boldly. Can I make a call from your phone? You're always the first to strike and you always win. Sorry, could you take a photo of me? This is the camera. I think yours is a special mission. You can use art to relax morals and make a human being out of an animal. This is just what our country needs right now. Make sure you get my legs. And the background as well. Maybe hold it up a bit and avoid the puddle. Well, up to you. It's your vision. Make it a multi-faceted composition. Thanks. - Did they approach you? - Yes. - Did they make you an offer? - Yes. You should accept it. - Yeah? - Yes. Well, there we are. Thanks to you, I've made a billion. I can use this money to create a new messenger and they won't be able to get me. What about your own sex life? Any success? The messenger is more important now. Thank you. - Guys… - Roman Petrovich… This is it? You're leaving us? It's just that I… Please… Don't leave us, Roman Petrovich. - Don't worry. - Lera… You've already done so much. You changed the world. You are already a winner. - Lera… - Everything… Everything we did was for you. You're insane, of course… But you can lead people to places they'd never reach without you. Lera… As Nobel Prize winner Boris Pasternak said… What? I don't remember… Do what you are good at. Go deeper. Could you bring some tea, please? - Hello. - Hello. Please meet Roman Petrovich. Roman. The CEO of Russia's number one TV channel. Roman Petrovich, we're so glad you agreed to help the Motherland during these trying times. Well, times are never easy for the Motherland, but now they're especially uneasy. Meaning, you wouldn't call them easy. I'd call them difficult. So, take a seat! Roman Petrovich… Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. As a professional in questions of depth, do you believe this man? We should all ask ourselves this: Where do we live? Where are we going? Is this just some populated land, or is this our Motherland? Here is the director of the program. He can't hack it. Roma, save me. We've met. Who are our enemies, I asked myself recently. And I answered! But how? With an answer! Because this is my country and I'm not the one to answer a question with another question. I hope you believe me! I don't. We must unite against any enemy I see in my head… That's exactly the problem. People have stopped believing us. - Hello. - Oh, hello. Please meet Roman Petrovich. - Roman. - No need to introduce you! Volodya. RUSSIAN TEARDROP VODKA "Why should I want to watch you?" He said in an interview… "Why should I want to, if you yourself don't want to want it?" State grants were given out, while people in Russia had nothing to eat. So we… Hey, but that was in the 90s. In the hotel room next to me. - Did you see how he was killed? - I don't remember… No, I didn't. And lots of Russian Orthodox people there convert to Islam in prison because the prison mafia bosses are Muslim. It's the Urals, after all. Don't compare it to Moscow. The provinces… Let's try it again. Hello. Today we will finally learn what is the truth and what are lies. I don't believe you. - You see, Vladimir… - You can call me Volodya. You see! This is exactly why no one believes you. Why? Even you don't believe in yourself! - But I have a script. - Fuck the script! You're on screen, the camera's rolling… - Who are you? - Me? - What's your name? - I'm Vladimir. You don't even believe you are Vladimir! Behind that suit and your phoney confidence, I see a frightened Volodya! So what should I do? Go on screen and say "I am Vladimir", and make me believe you. Hello, I am Vladimir. I don't believe you. Hello, I am Vladimir. Pathetic! You don't believe in yourself! Little Volodya! Sorry, could I have some more? On the other side of the screen 140 million people are watching. And they believe you. They believe you will protect them. - One hundred and… - 140 million. And all their hope is on you. On me. Now do you see who is the top man in this country? And now feel your inner Vladimir. Put the script away for now. Has Vladimir been activated? Hang on… Vladimir is activated. I can actually feel it already. This is him here. In your solar plexus. Now he's going higher. And now softly, but from the heart, for the Motherland, for the 140 million. Hello, I am Vladimir. Good evening. Today we're going to talk about us, the 140 million. And I am just one of you. Citizen number 140000001. My name is Vladimir. How are you doing? Are you well? Thanks. I should get back to work. Sadly, there's been a severe lack of truth and depth in Russia's National Theatre. Are you implying that I am fired? It's nice to talk to an intelligent person. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. Friends. Roman Petrovich has been appointed the new top director. I hope he, as a star and a cultural missionary, will get you ready in time for the premiere. I wish you success. We very much hope the style of the show will meet expectations. - Thank you. - Don't be afraid of anything. The more hardcore the better. I remember this house, many years ago. When you were a girl and I was already an old man. Hey, why would you say that? No, I'm the one who is old! You haven't changed at all. The house… The house hasn't changed, to be more precise! As a child, I used to wake up every morning and run barefoot to the river, to where the swing was, and you, Andrei Ivanovich… Oh, you remember! - You would push me on the swing! - And me too! You swung me and swung me… Stop! What are you putting on? Yes, Roman Petrovich. There are some questions here, it's true. - I have some questions too. - Yes! For example, I'm always talking about the house. But what is a house? It's not like it's about the building. The meaning is probably wider. Could the house be Russia? All dry and fallen into ruins. At any point it could collapse and bury its inhabitants. What if we do it like this? Ira, give us your line please. I haven't changed at all… The house! The house… …hasn't changed! It hasn't changed! Well, maybe… I don't know… And what about my character? She says she ran barefoot to the river. Why did she run? Maybe she wanted to run from her new status as a married woman? What about me? How did my morning go? What did I eat for breakfast? Yes! Maybe there was nothing to eat for breakfast and that's why she decided to sell the house! Take your clothes off. Was what I said unclear? - Roman Petrovich… - If you are an actress. Have you seen my films? - Of course. - Yes. - Did you find them interesting? - Very! - Yes! - Yes, they are very… deep. It's the depth that made them interesting. But without the interesting part you don't get the depth. Would you go to the theatre to see this kind of rubbish? Be honest! Be very honest! Your bra. Take it off. Look at her. Lift up your eyes and look. Nina, arms down. Down! Now be honest! Is this interesting? Yes. Why should the audience be bored? Why should we all be bored? We live, we live and we keep living and it's boring! Who are we lying to? Are you an actor? Or you… you say in Russia everything is just one big lie. But don't you want to tell the truth to yourself first? Me? I never lie… But you've wanted her for years. Roman Petrovich… Have you seen my films? - Yes. - Did you find them interesting? Yes, very. Get undressed. And you get undressed too. Who are you? We're from the drama school. We're interns here. We're here on work experience. You see how their eyes are ablaze? - Is this interesting? - Yes! Very! It's genius! Come up here. Everyone get completely undressed. Your line. I remember this house, many years ago. - When you were a girl… - She was! And he wanted her the whole time. Moreover, he wanted to be her first. Every time he visited, he'd wonder if someone had already fucked her? He knew it was forbidden to him and went crazy waiting for this day. Now you! - You haven't changed… - And she wanted him too! But she also knew she couldn't. But what if they told the truth just once? So he goes over to her… Go on! How did you want her? I never thought about it… - Do you believe him? - No. You've thought about it a thousand times! You imagined it! Do it! Who would have thought? Smell her hair! Kiss her neck! Steadily move towards her shoulder blade. Now you! Your line. As a child, I used to run to the river every morning, barefoot… You associated yourself with the river. And the river makes you what? Wet. - So what's wet? It's all wet. It's all wet. - Did you push her on the swing? - Yes. You swung her… You swung her! Go to him. Get on your knees. - I can't. - You can! You can! You think you are iceberg-deep, but you're as flat as… As an iPad. People used to be burnt at the stake for truth! And you here, with your decent salaries, you lie, lie, lie! You are just pretending to be actors. You're a pile of shit, not actors! - You're from the drama school? - Yes. So why are you still in your underwear? Lights! Music! Action! The rehearsal has started. Wake up. Roman Petrovich, the actors are ready. The actors are ready. Wake up. - Right, what's next in the script? - The heroine and the coachman. Great. You can start. Should I take my trousers off right away? We'll see. Anna Arkadyevna, shall I harness the fillies? What are you waiting for, Tikhon? Yes. - Everything clear? - Of course, Roman Petrovich. Roman Petrovich, should I start with the whip? Roman Petrovich, some people have come to see you. Keep going! - Hello. - Hello. Did we interrupt you? - No, we're working. - Excellent. Of course we're not here to disturb you. You remember what we need most of all? - Most of all? - Yes. To go deeper! - Did you get the scene done? - Yes. - Let's see how you've done. - Again? OK. Was it hard to do contemporary theatre after working with the classics? And is it true that we're in for something shocking? It's not hard if you're close to the director. It's an actress's job to strip herself naked. So we'll see you strip? Let's wait for the premiere. Is it true that you and the director are more than close colleagues? You are making me feel a little embarrassed! We have two more interview requests. OK. Excuse me, how would you like your steak? I'm a vegetarian. We'd like it bloody. Why would I want it bloody? Only you won't have blood on your hands? Was that some sort of joke? Well, just… Just what? Did you get that from Paulo Coelho? I don't want to talk in aphorisms and jingles. - Fine. - And I'm not going to eat meat. Of course not. I'm only eating a bit, just for the hemoglobin. Right… Not exactly straight to the point… I still don't know for sure. Maybe… From whom? Hey! How can you ask that, Roma? I haven't been with anyone except you. You don't trust me? Sorry. - I think it's not good… - What? We should cut all that on-stage porn. It's all a load of rubbish. No, Roma! You're a genius. You are the best of our contemporaries and the most contemporary of the best. Coffee? Do you have chicory coffee? No. - I'm going for a smoke. - You don't smoke! Do you have a cigarette? Hello. No need, thanks. We're worried about you. The premiere is tomorrow. - Is everything OK? - No. - Listen, I've been thinking. - What? You need help getting something extra? No, it's not that. I think it's too much. You shouldn't have porn on stage. We should cancel the premiere. Roman Petrovich, do you understand that this is a state matter? The president will come tomorrow with foreign guests. We have to show the whole world that depth is the Russian brand. A counterweight to the superficial West. But… I think it doesn't have to be porn. What? Of course it does! You found the perfect way to convey the state's doctrine to our citizens and to the whole world. OK. - Let me out. - Where? Let me out of here. Here. Roman Petrovich… Roman Petrovich, please don't go running. I don't know. Maybe this is considered intellectual now. I don't want to prejudge. But when they needed me, everyone cried "Khachatryan, Khachatryan!" Then they traded me in for this pornography. I dunno. Maybe everyone will like it. Or maybe not. Then they'll ask you to come back. Anna Arkadyevna, so should I harness the fillies or not? Tikhon, harnesses are out of fashion! Let's explain what's popular now. Bicycles. I don't understand, my Lord! They are like horses, only they don't ask for hay! Show him, Ivan Stepanovich! - Show him! - Please! Everyone is asking, will they… do it all together? Well, they won't do it individually. - When will they start? - In the second act. OK. Where are you going, Roman Petrovich? To get some air. There's air in here. When you were a little girl, while I was an old man already. You're not old! You haven't changed at all. Some air? Do you want to find out how much I haven't changed? Right now? After the interval. The interval! Where is our star? He's getting some air. - Is he far away? - No… Getting some air. Are you ready? Yes. The Pacific is much deeper than the Atlantic. So when the need for some real depth appears, people look towards the East. Perhaps the source of the Russian soul lies right in the depths of the Mariana Trench. Don't translate the part about the Mariana Trench. I already did. Nervous? Nerves are for the young. Did you take the pill? Ira, enough already. Everything will be fine. The West could do with your courage. It's an incredible feat to take this porn and turn it into a state doctrine. This is who we are. I asked you not to run. I remember this house, but many years ago. When you were a little girl, and I was already an old man… Do you want to find out how much I haven't changed? Why are you on your knees? Because I've wanted to do this for so long. Even then… …I wanted to fall at your feet, as if you were a God. It's not me who is on her knees before you, but that girl. Do you remember when we met? Yes. You took off your jacket in the same way. You stood by the window and breathed in, as if you wanted to breathe in all the air in the world. And I looked at you, realizing that I… …don't know how to breathe. What do you mean? You walked in and sat down. I saw you and realized that I had no idea how to… We all breathe in our own way. We think that we don't need to learn how to do it. But you as stood by the window, I realized that we should breathe differently. - Deeper? - Yes. Because there is something inside us, beyond our lungs. - Our heart? - Beyond that! Beyond ourselves even! We should breathe so as to break through the floor of that house, the soil of the garden, and reach the stars on the other side of the world! That's how! Anya! As I stood by the window just now, I realized that it was the deepest breath of my life. It's been years, I've never breathed like that again. I felt your gaze on me, that's why. It went right through me. - Through your heart? - Deeper! It pierced my chest. It flew far beyond the river, beyond the mountains and the oceans. I stopped being me, I no longer existed in my body alone. I became your gaze. And if I saw something wonderful, I rejoiced, because you might rejoice. And if I saw something awful, I ran from it, so as… All this time I didn't need to blame myself? So as not to offend your gaze. But I am not God for you to always live under my gaze! You are more than God! Under His gaze you are frightened and small, measuring your steps from birth to death. But under your gaze I soared! I was so much lighter than my body and my fear! Why didn't you turn around then? We could have been together every second of our life, and now this life is ending. Why? I will atone for every day of your loneliness. For every morning you felt joyless. I will never let you go again. So, will we change the world together? Thanks, but we'll try it on our own. Are you implying that… It's nice to talk to an intelligent person.
