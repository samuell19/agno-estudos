THE CLINIC Dear Mum, have a wonderful Christmas. Hope all your days are merry. Oh, that is terrible. I-I can't write that. That is so bad. I should've bought one of those cards that already has stuff written in it. Can you suggest anything? How about; "Dear Mum." - Yup. - "Merry Christmas." Got that. "Maybe next year you could visit us so that we don't have to travel across the country to see you." Be nice. She likes you. I know. Jesus, this guy's really moving. I need some inspiration. It's just desert. I've got it. Babe. You might want to sit up. Yeah, in a second, babe. Now, Beth! Are you okay? Yeah. Are you sure? We're okay. What a fucking maniac. If I hadn't swerved, he would have clipped us. We should stop for the night. Call your Mum and tell her we'll be there tomorrow. No. No. It's Christmas Eve, Cameron. I'm not--I'm not waking up in some seedy motel room. Hey. Who said anything about a motel? We could pitch the tent. Can we stop? Okay. That's actually really good news, because we're almost out of gas. Hey, this place looks all right. Maybe we should pitch that tent. It's okay. I'm gonna ask for the Presidential suite. Good luck. Wow, that's a nice car. Maybe the Presidential suite's already been booked. ♫ Squeeze me baby ♫ ♫ Squeeze me ♫ ♫ Squeeze me ♫ Hello! Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me. Welcome to The Overlander. Just passing through, are you? We're on our way to spend Christmas with my fiancée's mother. Oh, outstanding. Is that your fiancée out there? That's her. Gee, you did all right for yourself, didn't you? Look at the fucking tits on her. Outstanding. God bless her. Lemonade? No, I'm good, thanks. How much is it? $105, even. The sign at the front says $35 per person. And what about the little one? What? You mean the unborn baby? Sure. You can't be serious. Them's the rules, fellow. You don't like it, next motel's two hours west. Oh, honey, honey. Feel that. Wow. What are you doing? Ow, get off. Cameron, there are people. Oh, God. Hi. It's not exactly the Ritz, is it? They were friendly. Mm, yeah. It's okay, baby. Just relax. I had the same dream, Cameron. Baby girl and the Roman numerals. It's perfectly normal to have strange dreams during pregnancy. All you need to remember is that it's just a dream. Let's go inside. Get a good night's sleep. Yeah. It's gonna be okay. How're you feeling? Better. Beth the miscarriage was a one-off. The doctor said there's less than 3% chance it could happen again. I know. I just couldn't go through it again, Cameron. I just couldn't. You won't have to. You're gonna give birth to a perfectly healthy baby girl. She's gonna be smart and beautiful just like her mum. Now, try and get some sleep. We've got an early start tomorrow. Hm. Beth? Beth? And you're gonna see a parade of some wonderful and very unusual-looking thoroughbred dogs. And my favorite stand-up comic will do a spot for us. Beth? Okay, so nothing's missing? - No. - Right. You went to the Sky Dragon, came back, and your fiancée's gone. Uh, door's unlocked but you can't remember if you locked it when you went out. Is that correct? I was half asleep. I'm-- I'm almost positive I locked it. Hank, it's Marvin! You in there? I'm comin'. Evening, Marv. Hank, this gentleman's misplaced his fiancée. Just wondering if I can ask you a couple of questions. You seen her at all? You, uh, notice anything unusual? No, sir. It's been real quiet. Just this fella, his fiancée, couple in room 26. All the guests I've got. Mr. Marshall, uh, you got a good relationship with your flancée? You, uh, quarreled recently? No, not at all. We have a great relationship. Do you have any history of mental illness, or amnesia? You, uh, currently using drugs of any kind? It's a standard question. This is bullshit. Beth is missing, she's pregnant, and I want her found. Got a picture of her? Oh, Lordy. All right, that's it. He's been infatuated with Beth since the minute we arrived. Easy with the accusations, son. I want you to search the motel. I'm afraid I can't do that. Nothing's been stolen. There's no sign of a struggle. I can't even report her missing till she's been gone at least 24 hours. This is bullshit. He knows something! Sir, I'm just gonna ask you to lower your voice. I will lower my voice when you start to do something to find my fiancée. Well, look, I could put this up in reception. - Ask people if they've seen her. - You son of a bitch! Calm down. Where's Beth? Tell me! You've gotta learn to control your temper, son. Outstanding. Thank you, Marv. Checkout's at 11. Actually, you'd better make that 10 being as it's Christmas Day and all. Look after yourself, son. She's bound to turn up sooner or later. Help! Hello? Hello, is anyone there? No! No. I think she's still alive. How did she get away? I had a feeling we'd find more. She's not moving. The Roman numerals. You're in a lot of trouble, son. Assault, resisting arrest. See, just last summer some fella struck a cab driver over in Bligh County. Threw the book at him. Gave the poor bastard 18 months, 6 without parole. That's if you can even get a trial. You see, the judicial system works different out here. It's real slow. Not like in the city. It's all right. I'm a doctor. Veronica, we have to get out of here while we still can. How are we gonna get past the fence? Well, maybe we could cut through. With what? I don't know. We have to try something. Ivy, we need to rest for a second. There's gonna be plenty of time to sit around and feel sorry for ourselves later. What's her name? Allison, I think. She hasn't said a word since we found her. How do you know her name if she hasn't-- It's on a pendant around her neck. I've heard about places like this. The child trade. Why are we still alive? If they just wanted our babies, they would have let us bleed to death. What else would it be? I don't know. Did you guys hear that? Help me up. Come on, sweetie. It's coming from in there. She wasn't stitched back up. No, she was. The stitches have been torn open. Did she do that to herself? If she had, her fingers'd be covered in blood. She's still alive. Put pressure on the wound. Get a bandage. Quick! Come on, quickly, quickly! If you survive please take care of my baby. My baby... is... blue. We can't leave her like this. All right, pull over! All right, take it easy, son. Take it easy. Get out of the car. Get out of the car! Uncuff me. Fucking uncuff me. Move. Son, do you realize how many felonies you've just committed? Oh, I'm not finished, yet. Put your arms around it. Pretend it's your sister, you inbred son of a bitch. She said her baby was blue. What could that mean? Blue baby syndrome is a term used to describe a variety of birth defects that can turn an infant's skin blue. Excessive nitrates in the blood, heart problems, that kind of stuff. Yeah, or her baby could've been cold. Or just really fucking sad. We have to leave right now. I-I don't know who or what did that to her, but I don't wanna stick around to find out. Did you hear what she said? "Take care of my baby." She also said, " If you survive." Our children are gone. They're not coming back. I'm not leaving without my baby. Not while there's still a chance that she might be alive. That makes two of us. I don't care if I have to search every room. What do you think, Allison? It's three votes to one. We're finding our children. Come if you want. Ivy and I will search the ground floor. Veronica and Allison the top. We'll meet back here. If Allison's taking the lantern, I'm going with her. Better company. Fine. Just promise me you'll look after her. You coming? Let's go. So what do you do? Receptionist? Topless dancer. Nod if I'm on the right track. Smile. It's for when people don't believe this really happened to you. Come on. How are you holding up? Better. The bleeding's stopped. Thanks. Beth, there's something you should know about Ivy. She told me she was raped. What? She was torn between having the child and having an abortion. Poor thing. Yeah. In a way I think that she was relieved to wake up and find the baby gone. Someone else had made the declsion for her. We're not the flrst women this has happened to. Allison! Allison! Allison! I found these. What the hell happened? I heard screaming, and then I found her lying here. You were supposed to look after her, Ivy. She wandered off. What the fuck was I supposed to do? Oh. What are you doing? What is that? I've got no idea. But it looks like someone was trying to get it out of her. Beth, maybe Ivy was right. Maybe we should just cut our losses and get out while we still can. No. No, don't say that. A woman did this to her. Allison must have taken it before she died. Wake up. Up! How did you-- Ah! Son of a bitch! You broke my fucking nose! Where's Beth? I told you before. I don't know. I'm not gonna ask you again. Sometimes I get a call from this lady and-and she asks if I have any pregnant women staying at the motel. Where does she take them? I don't know! The-the-the old abattoir on-on the outskirts of town. Just drive west and you turn left at the old wagon wheel I-I swear. I swear, I swear to God. I swear. I swear. I swear! Do you think she killed the woman in the locker room? It wouldn't surprise me if that woman had one of these inside her as well. The Roman numerals. Hm? I don't know why I didn't pick it before. Look, they're a sequence. This woman is 604. Allison was 605. Ivy's 606. I'm 607. You're 608. Beth. Are you all right? I'm fine. Are you sure? You look pretty pale. It-It's nothing. Really. What is it? Formula bottles. Push! - Ready? - Yeah. Beth, we're hurting them. How do I know which one's mine? How do I know which one's my baby? They all look the same. What is this? Oh my God, they all look the same. You all look the same. This baby was Allison's. What? I'm pretty sure we, we each have a different colored tag inside us. The woman we found in the locker room said her baby was blue, right? Her baby wasn't cold. It-it wasn't sad. She'd seen the color of the tag inside her. This baby was hers. How did she know the tag was blue if it was in her stomach? When this woman tore it out of her. This woman knows about the tags. She knows if she can collect all of ours she'll be able to identify her own child without having to tear herself open. We have to get them out as soon as possible. It's different. Now I've seen her. I-I think I can get our tags out. Near where I woke up there was a veterinary laboratory. I saw medical tools, anesthetic. I could operate. When we have the tags, then we can search for a way Into the cages. Lead the way. Which way? Straight ahead. You sure? We don't have time to make a wrong turn. No, I'm sure it's this way. We've gotta find another way. Come on. Come on, get up! Wake up. You were having a nightmare. You know, it's quite common to have strange dreams during times of-- --pregnancy? I mmense stress? I've had the standard diagnosis before. It's bullshit. Why do you say that? What if I told you I'd seen this place in a dream? Yeah, well, like I said-- No. Before I got here, before I knew it existed. I dreamt all of it. The babies, the Roman numerals, all of it. That's impossible. I know it is but I did. Why didn't you say something? Two years ago, I had a miscarriage. That's when the dreams started. I'm sorry. I guess you get tired of hearing that. I'm gonna try and climb out. Follow me up, okay? I can't. I've tried. I can't put pressure on my leg. I think I've dislocated my knee. Okay. Come on. I can't! Hold on, okay? I'm going to find something to get you out. Oh, fuck! Who's there? Beth? Veronica? Who's there? ♫ Silent Night ♫ ♫ Holy night ♫ ♫ All is calm ♫ ♫ All is bright ♫ ♫ Round yon virgin ♫ ♫ Mother and child ♫ ♫ Holy infant ♫ ♫ So tender and mild ♫ ♫ Sleep in heavenly ♫ ♫ Peace ♫ ♫ Sleep ♫ ♫ In heavenly ♫ ♫ Peace ♫ You're in Duncan's house. Ladies aren't allowed in Duncan's house. Ms. Shepard's going to be so mad. Ms. Shepard's going to be mad at Duncan. Ms. Shepard's going to be s-- be s-- be so mad at Duncan. N-not allowed to have ladies in the house. Not allowed to have guests. Ms. Shepard's going to be so mad at Duncan. No. No one's gonna be mad. Do you like candy? Hey? It's all right. Come on. Have some candy. My name's Beth. My name's Beth. Hey. Who's Ms. Shepard? Is she the woman in the photograph? She's Duncan's mum, but not allowed to call her that. Ah. Does she run this place? Do you work for her? Duncan clean the floor, then hose the floor then bleach the floor, then mop the floor. What is this place, Duncan? Tell me. D-C-V-I-I-I. D-C-V-I-I-I. D-C-V. D-C-V-I-I. D-C. D-C-I-V. D-C. D-C-I-V. Do the keys on your belt open the cage to the babies? Duncan not allowed to talk about it. Why can't you talk about it? Duncan, wait! Wait! Duncan! Duncan! I found a set of keys. One of them has to open the cage for the babies. Okay. Ivy's dead. Can you walk? We're about to find out. Beth, I need to rest. I think I can make you a splint. Okay? Won't be long. Sorry. How's that? Higher. You've got to lash above and below the joint. Fuck. Come on. Please Beth, hurry! Let's go. We don't have much time. In there. Beth, I need you here now! Soak up the blood with that. Hurry. I'm going as fast as I can. Just keep going. It's all right. Come on. I can't see. Yeah. Hold on. I'll try and find a light, okay? It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. It's alright, I've gotcha. I gotcha. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Sh-sh-she was ye-yellow. There's four. You still need one more. No! Please, don't. Promise me something, and then I'll give you my tag. I promise. If my baby's still alive promise me you'll take her with you. Never let her know what went on here. Promise me. I promise. This woman she showed me the room with the baby and she said the only way to find out which baby was mine was to kill five women and collect the tags she'd planted inside them. I didn't believe her at first and then she showed me this. I just-- I wanted to know which baby was mine so badly. I didn't know what else to do. Please, look after my little girl. Red, orange, yellow blue, green-- violet! No! Who's there? Who's there? And initial here. Thank you. I think you'll find everything's in order. Physically, she's one of the strongest we've ever had. Strong heart, very healthy. I was very lucky to find you, Beth. Sometimes one of the mothers doesn't survive a C-section. My clients pay to select a child from six different mothers so I had to find a replacement at the last minute. You are the first substitute to ever win. This is the only facility on earth where adopting parents can evaluate the mother of their prospective child before purchasing it. Why gamble on a baby concelved from some unknown whore when you can select an infant spawned from doctors, lawyers, elite athletes? Adopting a child isn't like buying an appliance. You can't return the goods if they're faulty. He says your daughter will have a good life with him. And may God have mercy on your soul. Please. I'm begging you, please. Please, please. Put the gun down, Duncan. Bang! No, Duncan, don't. Don't listen to her. I need your help. This is all just a game. We've been through this. No, Duncan no more bleach the floor. No more bleach the floor. None of this is real. No, she's lying, Duncan. She's lying. They're hurting me. I need you to unlock these. Bang! Duncan! Oh, you've got Duncan keys. You got 'em. I want you to shoot the woman, Duncan. No, Duncan! Duncan, don't. We're friends. Shoot the woman, Duncan. Duncan, I gave you the candy, remember? Shoot her. Shoot her, you stupld retard. Do as you're fucking told! Sh. She has your eyes. Don't you come any closer. You've matured into a fine young woman, Beth. Your parents must be very proud. Stay back! How's your father? You and Roger must be very close. What did you just say? Roger and Judy seemed like such a happy couple. How do you know that? How do you know their names? I thought I recognized your surname. Church. I pulled your file. Born 12th of May, 1950. Biological mother Lydia Hayes. Adopting parents, Roger and Judy Church. No. No, you're lying. Roger couldn't legally adopt children of his own because of his criminal record so he came to see me to purchase a child. I can still remember the transaction. He paid cash. I don't believe you. I can still remember your biological mother, Lydia. She tried so hard not to cry as Roger was about to end her life. She was a strong woman much like yourself. But she wasn't a killer. Well, evolution's a bitch. How does that feel? Excuse me. Oh, hello, love. The man that just came through here, do you know him? Um...yes, I know him. But he keeps to himself most of the time. After what he's been through, I don't blame him. Why? What-what happened to him? His wife went missing. They never found her. She was pregnant at the time. You all right, miss? You look a little pale. Does he live locally? He lives on the other side of town. Look, ah, I'm just about done here. Would you like a lift into town? No, I-I think I'm gonna walk. Thanks anyway. You take care. Subrip: easytobeaman
