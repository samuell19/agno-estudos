I can breathe freely here. - Aren't you cold? - No. Will you stay for a bit? It's amazing how much fruit one tree can produce. - You could make jam. - We may live in the country, but we're not retired. Have you heard from the university? No, but I'm not worried. They'll be more organised than Paris. - That'll will be enough, won't it? - I think so, yes. Won't I look stupid with my little basket? You're irresistible. They're gonna love you. Is anybody in? All right,all right. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi, I hope we're not disturbing. - No. We're new neighbours. In... - L'Aussagne. - Ah, I see. We wanted to say hello. - So, this is my wife, Pauline. - How do you do? - How do you do? - And I'm Alex. Alex Charpentier. Ah. How do you do? I'm Mathilde. Oh, I'm so sorry. - I was modelling - We're bothering you. Not at all. On the contrary. I was getting pins and needles. - We brought you some cherries. - How sweet of you. You look adorable with that basket. - Yes. - Well, come in, come in. - Let me offer you a drink. - That's very kind. - Come in. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What brings you to the area? It was my decision. I could no longer stand Paris. The pollution, the transport system, the stress. I feel great here. And I love gardening. A flower amongst flowers. The real job was convincing Alex. He's more of a city guy. - What's your occupation? - I'm an anthropologist. An anthropologist? Tell me more. I'm studying the evolution and dynamics of human populations. - Is that useful? - Not really. But it fascinates me. No, thank you. Right now I'm looking into the issue of Hispanic assimilation in the US. Got to say you won't find too many Hispanics in this area. No, no, that's true. In any case, I'm delighted to have neighbours like you. - It's a change from the loner. - The loner? She means the pensioner who lives on the other side of the village. He came back to the family home. He used to be into forestry. Now he looks after his garden. - Ah! - Yes, he's a bit odd. Odd? That's not a word I would have chosen. - How would you have described him? - Weird. Yes, weird. You're right. He's weird. He's a loner. Where do you exhibit your paintings? I don't. No, I sell my paintings abroad. - You don't have to be formal. - OK. Neither do you. So tell me, why don't you sell over here? Because this is where I paint my wife. I only paint my wife. Alex? He's fine. He's adapting. He's already preparing his next seminar. No, not that one. The one in August. He's working like crazy. He's giving me hang-ups. - He's a bit obsessive. - I can hear you. I know. No, Alex is messing around. Are you kidding? I've emptied all the nurseries. I bought huge laurels. I bought some beautiful flowers too. I'll put them in the flowerbed. It'll hide the corner with... The leeks and onions, Mum. No, I'm eating a... I'm always hungry here. I can't stop eating. Even between... Wait a second, Mum. There's a man at the door. I'll talk to you later. Bye, Mum. Hello. Sorry to bother you. I'm Gilles Vasseur, your neighbour. Pauline Charpentier. Hello. Hello. - Sir? - This is Gilles Vasseur, - our neighbour. My husband. - How do you do? - Hello. - Alex Charpentier. Please forgive me, but I'm running late. I must finish an article. - I don't want to intrude. - Not at all. Darling, look after... - Sorry, what's your name? - Gilles Vasseur. Call me Gilles. - Gilles. - Can I offer you a drink? Why not? Do you have any orange juice? - Of course. Come in, please. - Thank you. It'll be a nice break from all the tidying up. Darling, have you seen my blue shirt? The stripy one. - It goes well with my linen suit. - It's drying. I remembered. She's wonderful. - Are you off? - Yes, but not for long. It's work. I'll be back Saturday. I'm sorry, but I really have to finish that article. Bye. Thank you. Ignore the mess. We just moved in. Alain "On Happiness". I'm a philosophy teacher. - Have you heard of it? - "Happiness isn't self-evident." "It needs to be earned." - "It only exists..." - "...If you will it." He also said, "When we're sad, even sawing wood is a good way to forget our sorrows." I know. I spend my time gardening. It soothes me. I'm the same. I love gardening. - You enjoy botany? - I'm passionate about it. As started gardening the moment we got here. Would you like to have a look? - Now? - I don't want to bother you. No, not at all. I love plants, but I like to help people out too. Follow me? I tried to do what's best for the plants. - I understand. - I know it requires time, care. Talking of which, your hydrangeas aren't getting enough shade. They don't like too much sunlight. Have you added compost? - I haven't, no. Compost? - Hydrangeas like acid soil. It's important to remember that. Oh, dear. Do you have secateurs? Yes. - Here. - Thank you. - May I? - Please. Anything nature doesn't like gets rejected. It's like a medical transplant. It may not take. It's got nothing to do with having green fingers. Plants are like humans. If you respect them... - They respect us back. - Exactly. Have you lived here long? I was born here. I travelled a lot, trying to combat deforestation. It didn't help with family life. - Do you still have family here? - No, I don't. Not since my wife left. She left? I wanted to ask you... Yes? No, never mind. Can I take a picture of you in my garden? Excuse me? It's just that I take pictures of any important event. I'm an important event? I'll be back. Alex, hurry up! I'm not the one catching the train. I'm coming! I couldn't find my file. - Hurry. - You brought a lot of stuff. - I just took some extra shirts. - You're only going for eight days. - Eight days is a long time. - Yeah? Will you miss me? I always miss you, even here. I miss you when you go shopping. - Still, 12 shirts for eight days. - I'll need a new shirt for every time I cheat on you. - You're such an idiot. - I love it when you get jealous. - Come on, let's go. - Love makes people stupid. Let's stay stupid. - It doesn't get easier. - I'll never get used to it. Neither will I. I hate leaving you alone in that big house. Don't worry. Nothing can happen to me. I must go. Hello. Listen, it would be nice if you came to dinner next week. Yes. What day? I don't know. Alex will be back on Saturday. Monday? We'd love to. But is something wrong? Ah! No, it's because I've just taken Alex to the station. Why don't you park the car? We'll have a drink. OK? - You OK? - Yes, I'm fine. What an arse! "Welcome to the neighbourhood. Gilles." Oh, my! Here? It's so hot! 37 degrees! I'm changing twice a day. Thank God I overdid it with the shirts. You're so handsome. You're not bad either. It's great to hear your voice. You could call me a bit more often. You know, what with the heat and all the work, I collapse when I get back to my room. You could call me before collapsing. Can't you see how much I miss you after only three days? - Aren't you exaggerating a bit? - No. But you're not completely alone. By the way, have you seen Gilles again? No, but I might go to the antiques' market with him on Saturday. Don't forget your camera. My... ? Oh, you're such an idiot. This landscape is so beautiful. It looks like a painting. Nature imitating art. Oscar Wilde. He's the one who said that. - Did he? - He was a freethinker. It killed him. - What are you thinking about? - That sentence by Alain. Remember? Happiness needs to be earned. It only exists if you will it. That's it. Do you want to be happy? I am. Your husband is very lucky, Pauline. I hope he knows it. Alex is the air that I breathe. I live for him. Are you all right, Gilles? I'll be fine. Would you like to get some air, take a few steps? Or perhaps I could call a... There's no point. See? I'm already feeling better. Go ahead. I'll join you. You scared me. No. Are you through? - You can email them to me. - All right. - Shall we have a look in there? - OK. It's a nice piece. It's a Tuareg knife. A real one. - What are you doing? - Testing it. Knives should cut. I'll take it. Why did you do that? It's a habit. In my work I often had to face extreme situations, serpent bites, lack of medication. It worried my wife a lot. Your wife... You... That's a very nice pot holder. Well done. - What's wrong? - I'd parked the car here. - Are you sure? - Absolutely certain. - Do you think they stole it? - That old banger? No. They must have impounded it. It happens to me all the time. We'll call and find out. Shit. I left my phone in your car. We'll use a payphone, the old way. - Let me help you. - No, no. It's fine. I was that badly parked? I didn't see the sign. It's not clearly visible. Yes. How much? - Gilles. - The price has gone up again? - That's a good money-spinner. - Gilles, I must warn Alex. Yes. Can I collect the car now? So the price has changed but the address is the same? Listen, I'll wait a bit longer then I'll take a cab. Call me, though. Love you, darling. I'll have to go to the pound. It's miles away. Take a taxi. No, I won't leave you like this. Alex will have to wait for me. Hold this, please. Thank you. - Are you available? - Yes, sir. - Let me help. - Thank you. Hello? Darling, what's up? I couldn't reach you. You forgot your mobile in Gilles' car? Why are you still with him? Oh. Listen, I'm taking a cab. See you at home. - OK. Thank you. See you later. - See you later. He's taking a taxi. I'm really sorry. Listen, wait for me in the bar where we had a drink. - I'll go, then come collect you. - I can come. I'm not encumbered. Yes, you are. Do as I said. I'll be back soon. The gate's open. He's back. I'm really sorry I made you late. Don't worry. I'll make sure he forgives me. - I'd ask you in for a drink, but... - That wouldn't be a good idea. Go on in. Don't forget your pot holder. Bye. Your garden will be marvellous. Where do you get your ideas? - From Gilles. - You spend time with him? I know you don't like him, but he's so full of good advice. Besides, he's quite sociable for a loner. He's curious, chatty even. No, I love talking to him. I learn a lot of things. - Be careful anyway. - How? Don't believe everything he says. About his wife, for example. - You think he made her up? - He was alone when he moved here. He told me she'd left. What do you think that means? That she left him? Or do you think she died? There's something strange about his past. We just don't know what. But one thing's for sure. The man isn't happy. He talks about happiness all the time. See? It's as if he were jealous. - Jealous? No. Why... ? - Pauline! Yes, I'm coming. Look at the wonderful painting they've given us. Ah, it's... it's fabulous, Henri. You shouldn't have. Are you mad? He's mad! My one model provides me with much inspiration. Your only model. Did you mention it? No, not yet, darling. But I will. I'm thinking of a painting that would juxtapose two types of beauty. One of them rather modern, the other more classical. Hand me your glass. In other words, a young woman and an older one. No, darling, that's not it at all. I'm interested in the mix of styles. Two beautiful but different women. Thank you. And I thought of you, Pauline. - Would this be a nude portrait? - Of course. It'll be beautiful. That's why I'm asking you in front of your husband. Yes. Can I think about it first? Naturally. But don't wait too long. Models have to be spontaneous. - Well, cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Are the chops ready? You know, if you want to pose for him, why not? After all, it's art. I don't see why Gilles would lie to me. - What are you talking about? - Gilles, his wife. Mathilde says she never saw her. He tells me she left. But what does that mean? Did she die? I can't believe it. You're obsessed with him. Listen, darling, who cares about him? Besides, never mind what Mathilde said. She's pretty batty too. - Have you seen that painting? - Don't you like it? - Not particularly, no. - I think it's magnificent. Sure, if you were the nude, it would be a masterpiece. - You're such an idiot. - I mean it. Stop it. - Close the shutters. - No. Close the shutters. Go on. I'm going, I'm going. I'll get it. Hello? Hi. Yes, fine. You? With pleasure. Great. We'll get ready and come over. See you in a bit. Bye. Alex, I've got great news. We're going for a swim. - For a swim? Where? - That was Gilles. He has a surprise for us. And he's got a pool. - You were dreaming of taking a dip. - I've still got work to do. How many bilingual Mexicans do you think there are in Florida? - Try and guess. - I don't know. Well, as soon as you're ready, let's go. I'll grab the towels. The Magic Flute. I love Mozart. How about you? Do you love Mozart? I'm going to Salzburg this year, to hear Riccardo Muti. - Are you going alone? - I always do. Even when you were married? - Would you like some sugar? - Yes, please. One spoon. Thank you. Is that an avocado tree? - Yes, it is. Well done. - From Mexico? You must have seen a lot of them over there. - And right next to it... - It looks like an aloe. It looks like it, but it's a gasteria. - I see. - People often confuse them. - It's a hardy plant. - So it's easy to grow? Yes, they're both succulents. - Succulents? - They have fleshy leaves. Oh, I see. So that's why... One feels so alone here. It's true, you're shielded from the world. You can't put a price on that. - I enjoy solitude. - Might you have something to hide? You're more interested in my private life than in the surprise I got you. Aren't you the surprise? Sorry, I thought you were. There's nothing very surprising about me. I wanted to hand your wife a gift, if I may. - Feel free. - Thank you. I'll be right back. You could be more polite. - I don't like him. - Then let's check him out. - What? Check what? - His wife. Maybe he's never been married. Who cares if he's a widower or a cuckold? - Relax. - I'm curious, that's all. - I'm curious. - Drop it. Who cares? Open up. It's locked. Come here. Stop! - Alex, come along. - No. - Come along. - No, you're crazy. Hurry. No. Let's go back. We're being ridiculous. Wait for me. I'm going up. Pauline. We'll get caught. I can feel it. Alex. Come and have a look. We can see it from here. - What? - Our house. - It's pretty, isn't it? - Yes, very. Come along. Do you think it's her? I don't know. I don't care. Stop it, Miss Marple. She's beautiful, isn't she? Very. I was going to ask you... About the surprise? It's waiting for you. Come along. Here. It's for you. That's the surprise. It's beautiful. - What is it? - An plant only found in Brazil. Thank you, Gilles. But why this wonderful present? You're the present. It comes from Brazil. Can you imagine? It seems to have handled the trip. Is it delicate? Yes and no. It's sensitive to temperature variations, to draughts. Don't leave it outside too long. Once it takes root, it'll grow amazingly fast. It can grow a new leaf every day. Every day? You mean one could almost watch its leaves grow? Exactly. It depends on one's sensitivity. What do you mean? It's sensitive to good vibrations. Then it'll like it at our house. No doubt. I love it. It's amazing. It's... It's a very rare gift, Gilles. Thank you. But let's be practical. Is this rare plant heavy? Because we came on foot. This thing's bloody heavy. I don't know if it's my vibrations, but it's heavy. Don't stop. You look hilarious. Don't stop. - You believe in all that nonsense? - What? The vibrations? - Yes. - Of course I do. Besides, where will we put it? The house is really draughty. I don't know. We'll see. Come on, let's go. All right, all right. Why didn't he bring it over himself? I always have to carry everything. Where shall I put it? - Hurry. - Over there. - There? - Yes. It takes up the whole room. But at least it will get sunlight. It would be nice to put it in the pot holder. The pot holder? Yes, you know, the one I bought recently. It's in the cellar. Don't worry. I'll get it. No, I'll go. Oh, sorry. - Getting back to your studies? - No. They haven't even assigned me any courses yet. - So what are you doing? - Making a logbook for Gilou. That's a good name for it, don't you think? Gilou? I bet you named it after Gilles. When will you put together our album? I'll do it later. Why are you upset? It's fun, isn't it? Look, I've already got loads of pictures. Look, here's the one of you carrying it down the path. Look. It's the very first. Can you believe it has grown five huge leaves in three days? Gilles wasn't exaggerating. It grows amazingly fast. - Where are you going? - Since I'm in a huff I'll go count its leaves, in case it's had a bad reaction. Dinner's served. Already? Can't you open a window? We can barely see each other. Alex, what are you doing? Dinner will get cold. The programme is almost over. Did you open that window? Yes, to let out the smoke. It would have been enough to open just one window. - Why? Are you cold? - No, but it no longer smells. You can shut that one. - Is it that important? - It'll cause a draught and the banging will keep us awake. You're worried about the plant, aren't you? Why risk it? Look! Look how well it's doing. It would be a shame to hurt it. Listen, I don't mind helping you coddle Gilou, but you can't stop me from opening windows when I feel like it. All right. Good. How hard would it have been to open just one window? - What? - Nothing. Shall we have dinner? - I'll watch then end first. - All right. I'll keep the chicken warm. - That's amusing. - Mathilde. - Ah, Pauline. - How are you? - You look a bit down. Are you OK? - I'm fine. - Do you have time for a drink? - Yes, a coffee. - Is Alex around? - He's putting the shopping away. - Where's Henri? - He cycles this time of day. - I didn't know he liked cycling. - Sometimes I don't see him all day. Alex cycled a lot in Paris, but he's become so lazy since we moved. I'll mention it to Henri. He'll suggest an outing. Have you given thought to his proposal? It might be fun to pose together. - Hello. Two coffees, please. - What a nice surprise. I'll be back. Gilles! He's never far off, is he? He doesn't dare come up because of me. He's a bit weird. He's jealous. He's allergic to people's happiness, so he has to meddle with your life. He calls, drops round, makes declarations. I didn't want to play along. So now he thinks I'm a whore. That's crazy. Pauline thinks he's great. She'll eventually catch on. I asked him round for a drink tonight. Is it in the right spot? Pauline? Where did she put the glasses? - I called it Gilou. - Gilles, Gilou. - Gilles, Gilou. - Ah. - It's nice, isn't it? - Can you find the glasses? Of course. I'd better close the window or it'll catch a cold. Gilou, Gilou, Gilou. I've a feeling it'll become your nickname. Coming, Gilou? Frankly, I prefer Gilles. After you, Gilou. Your garden is so relaxing. The reason we feel comfortable in nature is that it doesn't judge us. - Nietzsche. - Ah. That's very true. No, thank you. So, not travelling any more? No. I'm off to Nepal. One of the few countries you haven't yet visited, I bet. I've always dreamed of going there. That's great news. When are you off? - Soon. - Going for long? We know when a trip begins... But not when it'll end. Of course. Ah, I was forgetting. I've made a logbook for Gilou. I'll go get it. Don't move. Did you know, Gilou, that since you gave us this plant it's taken over Pauline's life? And you resent me for that, right? Oh, you know, after a time she'll lose interest. - The same happens with couples. - Yours, perhaps. Sorry, but I'm not worried. If Pauline is so attached to it... perhaps you'd better pretend to care about it too. Thank you for the advice, Doctor. Here it is. Excuse me. I think you'll be amazed. - So that's... - The first day. Gilles! Gilles! Water the roots, not the leaves. You'll harm them. Will you tell me what's wrong? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Why are you sulking? Your Gilou pisses me off. He's always around. We came here for peace and quiet and instead we've a neighbour who busts our balls with his stupid plants. And you love him. - That's what pisses me off. - What about you? You treat him like shit. He's a really interesting man. - Oh, you're jealous. - Jealous, me? - Yes. - That's a joke. He's the one who's jealous. - Why would he be jealous? - Because we're happy! Ah, you think it's funny. - Alex, you're ridiculous. - Yes, I'm ridiculous. - No, stop! - Stop! You're jealous! I must water Gilou. Great. You watered it yesterday. Alex, come see! I've never seen anything like it. Do you think it's because you love me? Slept well? You rascal. Good grief, you went to town this morning! It's good. There's enough to feed an army. It's good for you. Gilou looks healthier than you do. - You seem a bit pale. - You think so? - You should rest. - No, I mean, she looks well? Who? Gilou. Do you think she looks well? Yes, she's in great nick. But you must look after yourself. Eat your croissants and we'll go. Where are we going? Surprise. Bring your bathing suit. Alex, stop! Let go! Thank you. Alex! Alex! Look. What's this about? We only left for three days. It can't have dried out this quickly. - You watered it before we left. - I know, I know. It's incredible. The moment she sensed we were gone, she reacted. She became depressed. Can you imagine? Are you mad? Are you telling me it missed us? Yes, that's it. It's unheard of. Darling, we can't become slaves to a plant who sulks the moment we leave. I'll water it. - Pauline, I was talking to you. - Carefully. - Pauline, are you listening to me? - Step by step. Did you know that two plants grown in the same soil... If you burn the leaf of one plant, the other one reacts. It suffers in solidarity with the other one. Now we've seen proof they also react to the absence of their carers. It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. Here you go. Here you go, my darling. I'll get you back to your old self. We're home now. Everything will be all right, you'll see. What are you doing? I'm making an experiment. - You're not going to sleep in here? - Yes, but you can too, if you want. On the sofa? When we've got a great bed that cost us a bomb? Maybe you're right. You should sleep in the bedroom. Gilou will pick up on the fact you don't give a damn about her health. - You're blaming me for its health? - Forget it, Alex. I was joking. So we're sleeping apart because of a plant? I can't believe it. I have a plant for a rival! - It's ridiculous! - It's fine, Alex. Yes, it's fine. Good night! You're already up? - What time is it? - It's early. Go back to sleep. Take your time. - Where are you going? - For a bike ride with Henri. - I'm already late. - You're cycling again? Great. That's fantastic! - Look! Am I dreaming? - Sadly, you're not dreaming, no. Is that all you can say? It's exactly what I was hoping for. It's amazing! This is becoming an obsession. It's all you can think about. - Where do I fit in? - You're not jealous of a plant? Come back to earth. You're talking nonsense. Look at yourself! Your eyes are shining as though you'd just seen the Virgin Mary. And I'm the one who's up in the clouds? Get a grip! Is that it? Are you through? Just one more thing. From now on, I don't want to hear about it. That's right. Go ahead. Get lost. - If only she could drop dead. - Do I know her? - The new tenant. - Oh? A plant. Huge. The leaves are as big as my chest. - A new one every day. - A gift from Gilles Vasseur? Yes. How did you guess? He tried the trick on us. But Mathilde never liked him. - So she refused it. - At least he leaves you alone now. Pauline is besotted with him. Don't worry about it. She'll soon stop worshipping the plant. But it's gone on for a while. And I have to go to Mexico for two weeks. I hate to leave her on these terms, especially over a plant. Have you thought of getting rid of it? No, if I chuck it out, Pauline will never forgive me. No, when I say get rid of it, I mean in a discreet, radical way. This feels good. You seem preoccupied. What's wrong? Alex and I had an argument. - Because of the plant? - How did you guess? It takes up too much room. He thinks you're jealous. Why don't you ever talk about your wife? You'll catch cold. - Come on. - I'm not sure. It makes me uneasy. Stop it. You sound like her. Just use the weedkiller and don't forget to throw out the evidence. Henri, don't mention it to Mathilde. No, plants are a guy's thing. Thank you, Henri. Hello? Yes. Hold on a second. What are you doing? Meditating? No, I was just looking at her. It's true that her leaves are amazing. Sorry, yes. Wait, perhaps if I move, I'll get a better connection. You'll be pleased to hear I've heard from the university. - When do you start? - On the 5th of September. That's a shame, I won't be back yet. Never mind. - Alex. - Yes? I'm glad it interests you. Of course it does. It's your job. No, no. I was talking about Gilou. I'm sure she'll feel it. No, I gave it a triple dose. Nothing. Zip. Nothing will kill the bloody thing. Yes. Listen, Henri, try to get Pauline to pose for you. It'll take her mind off things. Promise? It's just that I'm flipping a bit about leaving her alone right now. That's nice of you. Bye. Aren't you ready? Yes, I'm coming. I won't be long. - Know what time my train leaves? - Don't worry. You'll catch it. I'll be right with you. I'll wait outside. Hurry up. I'm sorry. We've barely time to say goodbye. Two weeks is too long. I should never have accepted. You seem tired, darling. - Perhaps I should stay? - I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Promise you'll get some rest. - I love you. - I love you too. "Enjoy the book! G." What Plants Tell Us. Honey? I can't see you. I don't get it. Have you deactivated the webcam? No. I don't even know how to make this laptop work. All right, well... Never mind. Can you see me? Perfectly. You look well. The screen colours must be flattering, because I'm knackered. It's all go. Not to mention that they're nuts about air conditioning. So it's 38 degrees outside, 18 inside. What with going in and out, it's killing my throat. Not to mention the ozone layer. But who cares about that? How are you? You seem distant. No, no. It's just that I've started swotting up on my lessons. How's Gilou? I thought were weren't to talk of that. Well, I still want to know. You've no idea. It's amazing. You won't recognise her. How about me? Do you miss me a bit? Obviously. Listen, I don't know. I've the feeling you're hiding something. No, no. I'm a bit tired, that's all. I see. Have your computer checked tomorrow. - OK? - OK. Ask Henri. He understands computers. I'll try. A big kiss. Me too. Hello? Yes, Henri. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. No, it's not that. I'm reading... I'm studying for my course. I've a huge amount of work to do. If you want. Yes, let's reschedule. No, I haven't changed my mind. We'll... Tomorrow? That's fine. Tomorrow at eleven. That's great. Yeah, big kiss. Bye. Pauline? Gilles, come in. Look. I'm always by her side. I don't want to miss anything she does. You gave me such a wonderful present, Gilles. I knew you'd like it, Pauline. How about your studies? Later... later. You know, the book you gave me is riveting. Especially the bit about the police investigation. - It's fascinating. - Yes, it is fascinating. A seemingly harmless plant to whom nobody had paid any attention turns out to be the only witness to a murder. Yes, they made suspects go into the room where the crime had been committed and the plant reacted to one of them. How could they tell? The plant was wired up to a system able to assess its response. When the suspect walked in, it reacted in a strange way. And the machine was able to detect that. - Did that really work? - Yes. So the suspect really was the killer? Yes, it was him.
