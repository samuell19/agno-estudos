One, two, one, two, three, four. Did you know there's actually only one groove on a record? It's true. Yeah. It looks like all these individual circles, but no, it's just one. One single line, 1,500 feet of it, to be exact, a third of a mile carving its way round and round in circles until... it finally just ends. To make a record it takes 100 tons of pressure applied under 1,000 degrees of heat, all to create this perfect vinyl platter. Now, what music goes on the record, well, that's where I come in.

I didn't get up the stage and perform the song, but you know what? I could have. Hell of a lot more fun to tell it that way, though. You realize that that's gonna be the problem with all these stories, right? Listen. I'm not... I'm not sayig that people are gonna be lying. It's just... Okay. Well, some of them might be. It's just that memories, memories are complicated, you know. We remember what we wanna remember. And we forget what we need to forget. To be at the heart of something as impossibly successful as what we had... Gladys Knight, the Isley Brothers, Bill Withers, Parliament, the Village People, Kiss, and Donna... it's... How do you expect me to tell you how all that really happened? Couple guys broke as we were to making over $100 million a year. I mean, first, you'd have to understand our crew, because there was just no one else ever like them. Cecil was my best friend. He was also a record executive who loved the artists and the music even more than the business, and the artists themselves... Oh, my God. They sure loved him... and trusted him, more than they ever trusted me. Larry was a music fan long before he ever became an executive. It was why he was so effective staying out on the road with the bands. He was also my cousin, and all great business is family. Buck had been a short-order cook before he married Nancy. Our PR man, he was the connection guy who could convince just about anyone to do just about anything. And Nancy. God. Every DJ and radio program director just loved Nance. She was our secret weapon, getting our music on the air and into your lives. She was also my wife's sister. Beth was, um... Well, she was the first person who ever believed my dreams could be more than just dreams. She was the first one to ever truly believe in me. And Joyce... You know, I may have met her as Kiss's manager, but... well, we'll get to Joyce. Just... give me a little time. Look. I know that we've been blamed for a lot of bad things that happened, and I'm not saying it's not sex, drugs, and rock and roll, because it was. It's just, it was sex before it was deadly, you know? And finding out who wasn't doing drugs would be a hell of a lot harder story for you to tell. But if what you're after is the truth of not just what happened but how it happened, then, you know, you're just gonna have to believe all of it, because every single bit of it was true. Even the parts that weren't. ♪ Everybody everywhere ♪ Los Angeles, February 18, 1974. There's a hell of a lot that comes before that night, but the story you want to hear, well, this is where it all really begins. Having moved out to California only two months before, we were throwing the biggest party Los Angeles had ever thrown, to launch Casablanca Records, the biggest independent record label anyone had ever launched. Absolutely I am. hit me. And we only had one band to do it with, and they were... well, they were, uh, different. I think this was a mistake. We should not let them go on tonight. -Bill, it's gonna be great. -Yeah? For who? Him or us? Are you really gonna put those guys up there wearing those stupid costumes and that stupid makeup? It's who they are, Joe. Nobody knows who they are yet. You know, I got friends at Warner Brothers, and people are talking. And they're not talking the way you want to hear. You know what they're not talking about, Joey? Huh? Shit that doesn't scare them. -Nelly, we're ready. -Yeah. Or excite them! Or make 'em want to dance or laugh or fuck or cry or fucking matter at all. Thank you, because the fact that people are talking, that's music to my ears. And you really spent all the three million dollars Warners gave you as an advance? Actually, I spent four million. Show time, Neil. Ooh, sounds like they're playing my song. Yeah, well, just remember, the house always wins, even against you. -You wanna bet? -I bet they suck. Uh-huh. Mwah. Hello. So, I had a thought... on my way over here tonight. I thought to myself, "What the hell am I doing in Humphrey Bogart's actual suit?" Poor kid from the Brooklyn projects, son of a postman. Oh, stand up, Pops. Pops. -There he is. -Thank you. Thank you. -Oh, sure. Take a bow. Why not? -Learned everything from me. Bad stuff from his mother. Hell of a long trip from Brooklyn, huh? Not so far, kid. Dreams... only come true for those who believe in them. So, tonight, to celebrate the launch of the biggest independent record label in history, we thought we'd share some of our dreams with you. So, you may have heard them on the radio, but after what you're about to experience tonight, you're never gonna forget these guys. So, put your two lips together for the hottest band in the world, KISS! Yeah, yeah, yeah, that way. - Hello, Los Angeles! - Ah! - How we feeling tonight? - Yeah, good. More. ♪ Well the night's begun ♪ ♪ And you want some fun ♪ ♪ Do you think you're gonna find it? ♪ ♪ Think you're gonna find it ♪ ♪ You got to treat yourself like number one ♪ ♪ Do you need to be reminded? ♪ ♪ Need to be reminded? ♪ ♪ It doesn't matter what you do or say ♪ ♪ Just forget the things that you've been told ♪ ♪ We can't do it any other way ♪ ♪ Everybody's got to rock and roll ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa ♪ ♪ Shout it, shout it ♪ ♪ Shout it out loud ♪ Yeah! ♪ Shout it, shout it ♪ ♪ Shout it out loud ♪ You know, Kiss may have been unlike anything anyone had ever seen, but I could see them.

Just like that... the night it all began... we were finished. You okay? You made it rain inside, Daddy. Do another trick. I'm working on it, honey. I'll get Jill home to Beth and the boys. Just tell her I'll be home soon. But you promised we'd dance, Daddy! You bet I did. Prettiest girl in all the world. I had worked my whole life leading up to that night, but KISS was dead the moment they took that stage. The town just hated them. About the time I got home to Beth, even she had heard what a disaster it had been. From the day I married her, she always knew the truth I was hiding. She just... didn't always admit it. Hey, you okay? Your sister tell you what happened tonight? Yeah. Even with everything that had happened along the way, we'd still always been better together. They, uh, say the biggest sin of a record man is believing in something because you have to, not because you do. But I had believed in Kiss, and I knew what Casablanca could be. ♪ Get yourself together ♪ But after the party, the town was already celebrating the death of Casablanca. Hello, Casablanca. Not that that was gonna stop us. Mark Parenteau, WABX! Kiss just got added to regular rotation in Detroit. Nance, you paid off Mark to do that, didn't you? Of course I did. Mwah! Love this woman. Mo Ostin at Warners needs you to call him back. -Of course he does. -He called six times. Of course he did. Hey, Cec! Hey. Bill called. Gene and Paul are demanding a meeting. Oh. Just tell them to get ready for the tour. -You got KISS a tour? -No, but you're gonna do it. Just find 'em a headliner that's not gonna be intimidated by them as an opening act. New artist from Giorgio. He'll be expecting a yes. - Scotty! You listen to this yet? - Ah, yeah, but they're Giorgio, you know? They're different. -How different? -After last night, too different. Last night went exactly as we expected, and that includes the sprinklers. - All set. - Like hell it did. ♪ I love to love you baby ♪ Her voice just... cut right through me. ♪ You layin' so close to me ♪ ♪ There's no place I'd rather you be ♪ ♪ Then with me here ♪ ♪ Ooh I ♪ ♪ Love to love you baby ♪ Play that again. ♪ I love to love you baby ♪ ♪ I love to love you baby ♪ ♪ Do it to me again and again ♪ Yeah. Get me Giorgio. He's ready for you, Mr. Moroder. Sorry I missed it, your party. I spoke to Cess-ull. -Cee-sull. -You have no money. Ha-ha. Well, there's always money, Giorgio, if you know where to find it. Listen. Those new songs of yours were different. The eighth and the sixteenth notes, that open hi-hat on the down-beat. That's new. It makes you move. Mm-hmm. Where did you find that voice? An American girl. She does the musicals in Munich. LaDonna Gaines. Gaines. Gaines. Her first husband's name was Sommer. Everything is hotter in summer. An Italian from Germany writing in English. You know what? Maybe we pretend she's German. I never could figure out his accent. What? Neil, you can't afford to buy my music. I may not have been at your party, but I could read. Even English. The party was to announce that we're open for business, and now, we're on the cover of everything. Because they say you're finished. That's 'cause they don't know what starting looks like, Giorgio. Now, I don't want your music for our label, okay? I want it for yours. Oasis through Casablanca. You let them write about that. Giorgio, why don't we take a look at some artwork? Good old flash paper trick, huh? Oh! Nelly, Warners wants to bleed us to death. I snuck a tape recorder into their little sales meeting. They wanna kill KISS to kill us. Hello, Casablanca. Neil, I think you're overreacting. Oh, really? So you're telling me that Bruce here did not tell your teams not to push our records? Bruce, the boys have concerns about how we're handling Casablanca. Actually, Brucie, the boys here are concerned that you might be a spineless little cocksucker. -Oh, yeah. That's also true. -Well, we don't have any actual proof about the cock-sucking. But we all know, and no one here's gonna judge you, Bruce. -Fuck you, and fuck you! -You see that, Mo? He's trying to fuck me. I don't blame him. Nobody gives a shit about KISS. -Were you not at the party? -This ain't got a damn thing to do about the party, and you know it. Oh, you're right about that. It's about the fact that they can't cut a radio hit. Their bullshit stage tricks make them a fucking joke, not an act. That's why their record's not selling. I wanna play you a little something from our newest record. You're an asshole, Bruce. Mo, just take a listen. It's got a hell of a hook. We don't promote KISS or any Casablanca records. We don't push 'em, they can't sell 'em, and that's how we end 'em. Fuckin' bleed 'em to death. - You fucking recorded me? - Don't touch me. -My wife got me that table. -He fucking touched me, man. What the fuck? This is fucking Warner Brothers, not some fucking New York back alley you just crawled out of, assholes! You messed with our business, Bruce, and nobody, fucking nobody, messes with our business, -not even you, Mo. -What the hell do you really want? Huh? You didn't come all the way over here just to beat up Bruce. -I did. -No. We want out. -From our distribution? -Fucking everything, all of it. You're broke. The whole town knows it. What are you gonna do? Go door to door across the country, selling your records yourselves? You'll never survive without us. No. We'll never survive with you. You're gonna remember this fucking meeting. No, and... and not with a fucking smile. So, bill me for your table and have a nice fucking day. Hey. You do know no one's ever done this before? Because no one's ever tried before. Launching our own distribution, we weren't just going up against Warners. We were waging an all-out war against all the majors at once. But if we were gonna survive, we absolutely needed a hit, which meant we absolutely needed something new. LaDonna Adrian Gaines may have been born in Boston, but her dreams had landed her in Germany, which is where her story with us really begins. -You're late. -I'm as early as I could be. He's releasing the song in America, and I mean right away. What? We haven't even recorded the real song yet. -It's just a demo. -When I'm done with the mix, no one will care. I'll care. Uh, you gave him control over how I look? He creates an image, a story. It's what he does. Well, don't you think he should at least meet the real me before he decides there needs to be a fake one created? LaDonna, your daughter is asleep in the hallway instead of a bedroom all her own, dreaming a sweeter dream than you could ever provide her alone. You will never get another chance like this. Sign it. They... they legally changed my name? He changed his, too. He was right. I had. And not just once. I was actually born Neil Bogatz, growing up in the Glenwood projects of Brooklyn, New York. Alright, Neil. What else do you want? All of it. By the time I was eight years old, I already knew that the life that I wanted was far, far away from here. Please. I swear! You hear that, kid? Your pops says he swears this time! You dropped your egg cream. We'll get you a refill. Are we poor, Pop? What? What you worried about? Huh? Hey, money's easy. You can always find money. A person's got to know what to do with it. That's what counts. Do you know what to do with it? Because it's not here. Do me a favor, boychik. Look at all these people, huh? Now, you got a choice. You can live in a four-color world or one in black and white like all these schmucks too terrified to dream of a world outside of our four shitty blocks. Eh, not me. I know what to do with it. I'm gonna get us the hell out of here. Hey. I promise you. Just... need a little more tim. That's all. Neil, you got all the machines going. It saves my time, Mrs. Finkelstein. If I leave these with you, you'll put them in when you're done? I'll give you five cents. Ten cents. Saves your time. You better fold them. - Let's go! - Within a month, I had 40 kids working the neighborhood. Here's how it's gonna go. I'm gonna assign... Within two, I was bringing in more than my dad. You know how it feels making more money than your father? Exactly how you think it does. By 1961, I had changed my name again to Neil Scott. I tried acting, playing the piano, even the sax, and while I always wanted to be a singer, it was as a dancer that I finally found the beat. My fiancée, Erminie McNulty, everybody. I am Neil Scott, your singer, your dance instructor, and anything else you need me to be tonight. But, uh, that's not why I'm telling you this part. Dance. Is that a statement or a question without the inflection at the end? Dance with me. We don't dance with the staff. Our parents own the hotel. Well, okay.

So, Murray-The-K does a monthly competition. He pits one new single against another. The one that comes out on top, he spins it 'til the grooves wear out. Well, okay. So, when do we start?

Anyway, after a short stint as soft porn actor Wayne Stewart, which there's really no need to get into now, I'd become Wayne Roberts, freelancing for Fortune Employment, you know, getting other people jobs, when MGM Records called looking for someone to run record promotions.

Everybody's counting on you, Neil, but you still keep going up against those guys at Viewlex, but you do work for them. What do you see? I'm being serious. No, no. This, this is our daughter's view of the world. She sees the ceiling, not the sky. Most people grow up in the same four blocks that they were born into because they can't even dare -to dream what's beyond them. -You're quoting your father now. That's dangerous.

So, we're here in a... You're gonna shoot your show in a recording studio? -That's right. -Somebody's finally gonna make a music show that actually sounds like music. She practice that line for me? Yes. I'm gonna, uh... I'm going to go check on the crew. -Here. Give this to them. -Yep. So, now that he's gone, you're gonna close me? I'm not here to close you. I'm here to convince you. You didn't become who you are without seeing what most people don't. Hmm. People love their music. It's not just what they listen to. It's who they are. It's personal. We don't wanna just play music on TV. We wanna show where it really comes from, why the hell it matters so much to us. Even if just for a song. Well, shit. You're gonna do all that in a show? I am sure as hell gonna try. And who the hell are you? -I need to, um... -Mm-hmm. I need to get back to this, but I really do hope you will consider it. It would mean a lot. To you?

It's worse than we thought. What? Donna's not selling anywhere? No one knows what to make of her. R and B doesn't want her. Pop doesn't get her. -She's just... -Different. The song's dead, man. You were wrong about the Gaines girl. It's Summer, okay? It's Donna Summer. Well, you were wrong about her, too, man. Hello. By 1975, we'd done everything we could think of to introduce Donna to the world. Right in my heart. The world just... didn't care. You said that he loved the song, that he was so sure that it would change everything. The song is over, LaDonna. I was wrong. Just because the audience doesn't hear it does not mean it isn't there.

So you want us to scale everything down, - cut the pyro and the lights? - No. No. No. No. If you're gonna be a headliner, we're gonna need to make everything all that much bigger, alright? That means more explosions and so much, so much louder. I have this guy, alright? He's got these risers that... You really think that more fire and some forklifts are gonna be what finally breaks us through? No. No. It is gonna be the music, and it was always gonna be the music, but we might just make enough noise to... to get enough people to actually listen to it, to pay attention. Why did you sign us? Our demo was good, not great. Even I can admit that. You had to know how hard this was gonna be. Why take the risk? Because your real name is Chaim Witz, and you moved here from Israel when you were eight years old, speaking nothing but Yiddish. Because Paul's real name is Stanley Eisen. Because two kids from Queens had dreams about being the next gods of rock. And little Neil Bogatz from the Brooklyn projects thinks he can make everybody's dreams come true... if he's just given a little more time. You know, your demo really was that great, Gene. Yeah. Raw and honest rock and roll, even without all the costumes. But I tell you what your real brilliance is, and I don't even think you know this. It's that you write every single one of your songs with the same four God damn chords. That means that any... any 14-year-old kid can go out there and buy a guitar, and within 20 minutes, they can be you! And that matters, Gene. That is who you are. Now, why did you sign with me, huh? Brand-new label with you as our only act. You had to know you were taking as much of a risk as we were. Because you never should have gotten out of the Brooklyn projects. And yet, here you are. Here we are. Two imposters. Only if we're wrong. I get that you like to gamble, but what if Joey was right? In the end, what if the house does always win? Well, then we raise the stakes so high that we become the house. Two hundred grand more. You're still upside down the last hundred. Why don't you make it a personal loan, then? Don't do this. You go upside down this big, it don't matter how much I fucking love you. Hey, you ever gambled yourself, Joey? That thumping in your chest right before that dealer turns over your next card? Anything is possible right before that moment. Neil, I'm telling you, I'm not gonna be here for you this time if you don't pay off. Are you gonna give me the money or not? No. -Two hundred? -Two hundred. I know it's bad. I just wish you would be honest and tell me how bad. It's... it's... it's fine. No. It's not fine We're not fine. None of this is fine, Neil. We were fine when we were on the floor of our home in New Jersey, when I was teaching you even how to read those books. And now, we are broke, and you are giving the guys bonuses! Hey. No. Did you sister tell you that Buck was the only one that took it? Maybe he was the only one smart enough to. Hey. Hey. Come on. Just dance with me. Oh. You stopped dreaming again. You did. You know what I dream of? It's that you're actually here with us, Neil, and not in New York or Las Vegas or wherever else you disappear to when you're too afraid I'll see the truth. What do you think the truth is? Beth, I love you. Come on. I'm always with you. I'm always with you. You, the kids, you're all I think about. You have to know she's going to end up just as hurt as me. I convinced myself for so long that it was okay when I knew that you were sharing your bed, Neil, but you are sharing your heart.

It's really simple. ♪ You've got a real type of thing going down ♪ ♪ Getting down ♪ ♪ There's a whole lot of rhythm going round ♪ You want a little bit more or you good? What? Yeah, yeah. You good?

How quickly can you cut us this new record? How quick can you build me a motherfucking spaceship? How much? A million motherfucking dollars. Would those be Earth dollars? I can't even feel my bones anymore. He's giving me space... I know what you need to do, Neil. - It's party time. - Yeah? It's time to fly. I'm gonna need you to hop on this ride with me. If Buck can handle it, so can I. You in or you out? I didn't start the heavier drugs because of what was going on between Beth and Joyce. Didn't start them because of what was going wrong with KISS and Donna and Casablanca. I just... I did them because I like... I liked how it made me feel. Why don't you take a ride with me, Neil? Alright. Let's go, Neil. It's on you. Okay. - You ready to go? - Do it. You ready to build us a spaceship, Neil? Fuck it. You look like you like it. I think he likes it.

And yours? Or is that not the kinda pillow talk you two like to talk? - Jesus, Paul. - What? I'm just saying what everyone's fucking thinking, man. - No. Let him say it. - It's just the truth. You're our manager, and you are fucking the president of our record company. You're right. That is the truth, which you didn't seem to mind when you asked me to give him your demo. You didn't mind either, Bill, when you begged me to convince Neil to sign us even though Warner Brothers begged him not to. Or when you asked me to get us on tour, Paul, and keep us on tour. You were all just fine asking me to roll over on my pillow and talk to the president of your record company then. Yes. I am your manager, and you know just how lucky you are that I am, because if I wasn't, you'd still be trying to figure out how to wear your mom's makeup, 'cause I taught you how to do that, too. Who I love is my business. Your business is to make the damn music. -That's your job! -No, no, no. -Start doing it. -No. It doesn't matter how we got here. This is real. This is happening. This is happening right fucking now. -Tell them, Bill. -You really want us to be the hottest band in the world? He better start paying us like we already are. There he is. There he is, folks, Chaim Witz, the demon of rock and roll. Oh! You want some real money, Gene? You want some real money? Well, then you go out there and you write us a fucking song that will actually make us some! - No, no, no. - Wow! -No, no, no, no, no. -Fuck you. You don't make it about them. Not this time. - Bill. - Uh-uh. I am sorry. We are renegotiating right now, or we're leaving. Bill. Okay. Okay. How much? A million dollars an album. And another million in tour support. You want two million dollars an album for a band that can't sell a... a fucking single? I want two million dollars an album for KISS. Bill. Okay. Fucking fine. Deal. We finished? It's just business. It's nothing personal. Of course it is, and you fucking know it. It's okay. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here's Johnny! Here he is, Lenny Bruce! Maybe you should slow down a little. Maybe you should speed up a lot. Hey! I love Lenny Bruce. Did you know that he was 40 when he died? You think it was worth it, dying so young but then having all that success? No. I think dying old and having all that success would be worth it. You promised our distributors a sure thing so they'll keep letting us ride on everything else. Well, it's Johnny Carson. It is a sure thing. Besides, a bet is only a bet if it matters. It's a wedding night, and you're both virgins. It's disgusting. Abe, Abe... You don't mean that. No, because it's me, Abe, because you've always trusted.. -Talk to me. -They're not waiting for Carson. -What? -They're returning all the unsold KISS albums and Donna and Parliament. -Everything. -That's -too many fucking records, man. -No shit, Buck. -What do we do? -We take 'em back, but you tell every single fucking one of them if they do, they don't get Carson! Neil. Neil! What? What if we're wrong about Carson? I mean, we're shipping gold. More. Over 750,000 copies already. And with the money we're spending on... on commercials and... and print ads... -It's Johnny fucking Carson! -And nobody understands why the hell we're even doing it! Then ship more! Spend more! Do you job and make them understand! This is gonna be the biggest fucking album of the year, okay, folks? You've lost your mind. Did you not hear what they said on the phone? And they're on our fucking side! -Nobody is on our fucking side. -Because nobody understands what the fuck you're doing anymore! Not even me! We were wrong about KISS, Neil, and we were wrong about Donna. Even George and his fucking spaceship. We were just wrong! And here we are, still betting money we don't even have on them! I can't even pay my... If we're wrong about Carson... We are not fucking wrong, Cec, not about any of them. We just haven't figured out a way to finally be right! -What the hell's happening? I dared question the postman's son from Brooklyn, and he didn't like what he heard. Oh, is that right, Cec? Is that the same postman's son been carrying your ass from nowhere to somewhere your whole fucking career? -Excuse me? -Tell me this. Did you believe we would make it this far? Now, be honest. Do you believe that we could actually go further? So, you do your fucking job, and I will go get the fucking money! Uh... He didn't mean that. Cec. Shit. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here's Johnny! The Carson album's still considered one of the biggest disasters ever conceived in the record business. The joke was that we'd shipped gold but returned platinum. Just... wasn't a joke. We'd given away so many promo copies that when the stores started returning them to get their money back, we were on the line for every last one, and it was killing us, killing us, because I was wrong. Biggest sin of a record man... believing in something because you have to... not because you do. I fucking begged you to pay back that money, Neil. You kept sayin', "Waiting for Carson." And I convinced them to wait, because this is me and you, but they're done waiting. I'm sorry. It's okay, Joe. Just tell them not the arm I sign contracts with. I remembered my dad, remembered my promise to never become anything like him. I just... can't remember the exact moment when I did. Egg cream? Just get us the fucking money, Neil. I fucking hate LA. - Jesus. - Neil! Jesus. It's not that he was a postman. It's just... I knew that he knew that's all he was ever gonna be. -Here. -I'm scared. -Come on. Shh. -I'm scared. Shh. Just our little secret, brother. Can we get something to clean him up? -You want a cigarette? -You're alright. It's okay. Okay. Come on. Get him up. Walk it off. Walk it off. Oh, fuck. -Come on. -Fuck. If we can't sell enough KISS records on our own, then folks, we are gonna need an army. -It's merchandise, Nelly. -It's a movement, Nance. I love KISS, but how the fuck are we gonna get people to buy shit about the album and we can't even get them to buy the fucking album? Because KISS has always been about the experience, Buck, and that is where we have failed. If you're not in the KISS Army, oh, then you are not in the KISS Army! You don't get the limited edition posters, the signed T-shirts, the comic books! -So we have comic books now? -Yes, created specifically for the KISS Army, and the only way to get into the KISS Army... - Is to buy their albums. - Thank you. Now, we have one very important question to answer: What color do we paint the building? Hundred bucks to whoever gets the... the best color. Okay. Can we just, um... Can we just get a minute? Thank you. Thank you so much. What about black? Can you imagine the whole fucking block was painted fucking black? -No, I can't. -Oh. Neil, you are my brother, and if you want me to go off this cliff with you, I'll even be the first to jump, but you have got to help me understand why. -We are broke. -Yes. Yes. That is exactly what all of these fuckers are saying. So, by tomorrow, I want an entire crew... no, two crews outside, painting the entire block, and I want you to pay them extra to do it slowly. The longer they're out there working, oh, the longer people are just gonna drive by and see 'em. -See 'em doing what? -Painting the building. We're gonna place one final bet. On who? On us. It started with a makeover of the building, but to the town, we were building our own makeover. I mean, every day, we'd announce a new promotion, but in real life, we were just swapping titles around like the paint colors of the building. We called everyone we owed, hyped every plan we had, making most of it up as we went along. -We made them root for us... -Mo. ...not against us. Where the fuck is all the money coming from? Nowhere. There was none. We... we just made everyone believe there was. We bet everything we had on everyone we already believed in. ♪ She's a stone-cold stunner ♪ We'd gone as far as we could go as fast as we could go.

Let's replace Gladys with Donna. And suddenly, for the first time, it wasn't just breaking one hit, because once Donna broke, the hits just never stopped coming. I knew what else we'd did wrong, too. Recording a live album of greatest hits from a band who doesn't even have one? -That's new, Neil, even for us. -Hey, they've always had hits. We just failed to record them in the way they needed to be heard. By recording KISS live, we finally captured the experience of KISS live... which is what we'd really been chasing from the very beginning. Turned out, we'd been right about them, too. We sold over nine million records. Every bet we'd made, we were right about all of them. We just... needed enough time for all of you to catch up to us. What is this? What are you doing? Oh, my God.

What's this all about? We sold half the company to Polygram. Forty-nine percent. We still keep control. We've lived an awful lotta years pretending to be rich. You wanna see what it feels like when we finally actually are? Nelly! Jesus Christ. Um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never use the Lord's name in vain, but... Fifty million dollars for just half the company, made out to Neil Bogart, a name and a life I'd made up along the way. Even paid Mo back every penny. Not because I had to, but because I could. My dad had been right. Most were all still there on the same four blocks of their lives. For those of you who don't know, I left Casablanca finally on February 8, 1980. It was a Friday. It was five days after my 37th birthday. Now, disco had officially died the year before when a local DJ set a bunch of records on fire to the roar of a crowd as if that was a fucking concert. Yeah. It was a good bet most of those were ours. Now, all of you remember, I'm sure, Donna and KISS and George, Village People, Gladys, the Isleys, Bill Withers, all the others. But I bet each of you $100... that not one of you has ever even heard of my name. And that's okay. It's not like I had the talent that they did, because I didn't, you know, or that I... or that I mattered like they did, because, uh... I... I couldn'. But I sure as hell made you dance. I sold over 200 million records, and all that music that I helped made possible... became the soundtrack of your lives. And we... we were in the business of making dreams come true.s Didn't we do that? And if we did, didn't... didn't that matter? Didn't I? Even if... even if only a song? I died...

Where's that drive come from? Probably, it originally comes from Brooklyn. - Brooklyn. - You know, all people that are born in Brooklyn seem to be able to bounce back, because you have to if you come from there. You have to have the desire to succeed and be a gambler, and I both have the desire and am a gambler. So, you were poor? - Yes. - Mm-hmm I came from Brooklyn, and I used to sing on the street corners and stuff. Do you think... I mean, what does it take to be a greaser? -I mean... -You got what it takes. You probably got what it takes. What do you think is the biggest misunderstanding about Neil Bogart? There are quite a few misunderstandings about Neil Bogart. If you feel like rocking the Hollywood Bowl, it feels like being rocked. How'd you get so down and out, Neil? I came out to California after having a company called Buddah Records in New York City, which was very successful, and I went into partnership with Warners Brothers Records. Inside of eight months, the partnership had just about dissolved, and I lost the quickest three million dollars anybody ever put up for anybody else. What does it feel like to lose a couple of million dollars? Well, the strange thing is, I really didn't have it, you know? Of course. I don't think if I had it, I could have taken the risk. You know, it was a kind of situation where I just kept going and really didn't stop to think of how I was going to pay it back. And fortunately, success was around the corner, and I was able to pay it back and come from behind. You did it by giving, first of all, one of the largest parties ever given in this town, -didn't you? -Yes, it was. He laughs about it. And you couldn't leave a tip, right? At the end, I couldn't. The party was fabulous. The reception was fabulous. The welcome to California was exciting, and from there, everything went downhill. About eight months later, I realized that um, it wasn't going to happen. I had just finished probably the most expensive album ever done in the record industry, which was Here's Johnny: Magic Moments From The Tonight Show, - and we opened... - Oh, you did that. Yeah. That was our record. You all bought that, didn't you? Yeah. We over-advertised, and we over-promoted. And we did everything you could possibly do wrong. And I went to Acapulco, and while I was there, scuba diving, I thought that, "You owe three million dollars. You don't have any money left in the bank." - Yeah. - "You might have payroll for about two or three weeks left." And I was down there, and I took the mouthpiece out and said, "It could be over." I mean, that could be it. You don't have to come back to the problems. You don't have to come back to face the failure. And, um... the last record I released at Buddah Records was a thing by Gladys Knight and the Pips, that when LA seemed too much for the man, he couldn't make it, so he's leaving the life he's come to know. He's leaving on a midnight train to Georgia. And I just realized that wasn't me. I had to win, or I had to fail. I couldn't cop out, and I put the mouthpiece back in. I swam and found Joyce. I said, "Come on back. We're going upstairs. We're gonna go back, and we're gonna do it. We're going to win, or we're gonna fail." And in the back of my head, I always had the thought that I can always go back to Brooklyn and open - a candy store. - Yeah, except there are a lot of those there, aren't there? Yeah, but you know, growing up there, I mean, that was always a kind of comforting thing that I could always go back to that, and that was a great life. Hi. What does a tiger say? That was the Bogarts, the fabulous Bogarts! Well, I want to thank you all. Jill, Timothy, Bradley, come on. Come on. Say goodbye to the audience.
