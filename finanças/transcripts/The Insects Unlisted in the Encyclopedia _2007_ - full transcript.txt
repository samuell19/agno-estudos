"August 01." "Black Book" Monthly I was at editing that day, "Black Book" monthly. I know it's inconsiderate, but please die. I don't understand... You love me, right? I don't, and I don't want to die. You'll do it if you love me. I don't love you! You know the rumor about 'Deathfix'? Kind of... The heart stops for hours, but then revives. Is it a drug? I don't know. Get some 'Deathfix'. Go and die, then revive and report on the realm of death. Corpse report?! It's interesting. It is, but I don't really... Why? I may not revive. Nobody cares if you die. I'm sure glad that I'm not you. I don't want to do it. Even if I ask this hard? That's no way to ask, what's that all about? Nipple! Nipple! Listen, you owe me half a million yen, you have no rights or dignity. Here's expense money. OK? The deadline is August 31. "If you're late, I'll kill you!!" How'll I obtain 'Deathfix'? Braindead! Figure it out by yourself! You think my blue mouth means I'm stupid. Yeah. What happened? I sucked on a glass. Actually... Also, cameraman Majima will be involved. Just have him do it. He hasn't contacted me for 2 or 3 days, maybe he's dead. Find his mummy. Let me out of it! It's a big mistake to think you're the most normal! That was me. Yeah. Oops, I might be a mess, can I go and check? Please do! Endo? Listen, I can see California from the window, Understand? Endo, sounds like you're all mixed up again. The California sky is amazingly "violet clouded". OK, just stay there. I need to talk about work. The Chinese character for "hill" looks like a seal. Whatever you say. Huh? "Hill" looks like a seal?! Good luck! I hate it. "Hill." It does look like a seal! Deathfix: Die and Let Live. How did I end up having to do this stupid job?! Dying and reviving is a job?! What's 'Deathfix' anyway? The sun's melting Rubber Road. I have to drive to Endo, music box making drunk. I have to save that alcohol-soaked Endo before he evaporates. What stinkin' ground! Even the stairs stink! And Endo... Stinks! Humans want to run for their life at least once, don't they? What are you doing?! Making a mermaid doll with a carp. Don't bother. Come with me! Wait! Let's get to work! Your breath is pure alcohol. You'll catch fire! Really? It stinks! Stinks! A woman I know said she likes winter. Why? "My breath turns white, so I know I'm breathing." Great idea. But we've got work! What work? You know about 'Deathfix'? I don't know. If you drink it, you'll die and revive. 150,000 yen each to give it a try. I'll do it! I'm already a new man. Don't do such things! My puke burns! What? Like it? The problem is, nobody knows about 'Deathfix'. That's a problem! It must be a drug if you die and revive. What you smokin'? Pain relief spray! Don't get mad! Refreshing! Idiot. Makes your guts cool! - Can I try? - Here. The editor-in-chief said Majima's missing, but we need clues. Majima! Majima! When you were a kid, ever put super glue on a doorbell? Hello! Package delivery. Huh? Ouch! Ouch! No, I didn't. What's up? It's unlocked. Majima... Nobody home? Maybe he's dead. Then he'd stink like crazy. Pudding! Magnetic health patch? "5000 yen." What's with the eyes? Don't pretty-eye me! Any clues? "Where? Witness?" What's that? I don't know. You do so know. I said I don't know. Magnetic patch and 'Deathfix' link? Endo, you stole his money. I said don't pretty-eye me. Hey! What is it? A yakuza! What's funny? It's OK, I also have business with Majima. It seems Majima's not home. See you. Hang on, I'm not done with you. Huh?! What's with this? Excuse us. What's with him? Yakuza, obviously. I know that. If his shirt's a carp flag, if he's Mr Eyeball... What's that "if"? Look, I made a contact lens. Trouble "if" you do that. So, we hit somebody? Relax. This is Jelly. Jelly? He'll stop any car. A life-sized human, Mr 'Jelly' Bruckheimer. You're mean in lots of ways. Anyway, let's try sumo leg wrestling. What for? Why are you looking for Majima? We're just looking for info. About 'Deathfix'? About what? You know, dying and then reviving. You're also looking? We could make money through a religious group. What is 'Deathfix' actually? I don't know! Knees! You say "knees" when you lose! Anyway, contact me if you find info. Understood. Knees! Editor-in-chief? Majima may be in serious trouble. He's dealing with really bad people, sumo leg wrestling... Be careful, Majima may have been killed. Come on, let me out of it! Can't I just quit this job? What the?! Hey, thank you. Hate sank "Q"? Forget it. This 5000 yen bill! From Majima's place? Yeah. I hate the gloomy face on this 5000 yen bill! Why so gloomy?! She's Ichiyo Higuchi. So, it's because she's Higuchi. A phone number's written here. Did you call it? A boat rental shop. A boat shop? "Night Light Station." Ticket... ticket... Going by train?! You're here, too? Thanks. Hello. See what's happened. It hurts! It stinks! That proves you're still alive. Is Majima the cameraman here? That boat shop saw him headed for here. I don't know. Do you know about 'Deathfix'? What's that? Maybe a drug to die and revive. I don't know! You're stinking loud! Any idea about this? No! It hurts! It stinks! The sun makes me sneeze. A headlock is for in the mountains! I lose! Lose what? Endo! Endo! Oh, he's Endo? Endo. Endo! Editor-in-chief? Endo sank into the sea, he's missing. No, I'm serious! What are you saying?! He sank and didn't float! You can't buy an "American Dog" in America. They sell lots in my country... Endo? Want an "American Dog"? No, I don't! What a waste! Itchy tooth... What? Itchy tooth. What's wrong? Scraped off some tooth! That's plaque! I see. Could this be 'Deathfix'?! I've become dizzy. What's that? Fast signing. "She sells sea..." So what?! It's about this. Look. Now what? What's that? I got it waiting for you. "The Wilds SM Club". What about it? It says you'll try death. That's unrelated... I guess. Is that so? Is it really unrelated? It's 100 percent unrelated? You're sure it's unrelated? Does the lion always get the zebra? Shut up! What's wrong? My silver filling! That's a sausage clip. You're right! Sorry, went out of business. Is that so? We're sorting out stuff. This rubber mask? Unburnable. This syringe? Enema one? Recycle. You know "sorting" is written just like "sorting"? Good point. Sorting out has no place in SM. It's all unburnable junk. Unneeded SM equipment is unburnable junk... Unneeded SM equipment is unburnable junk... Unneeded SM... We heard you! So, respond! What is it? Why are you here? Do you know 'Deathfix'? What's that? To try dying. Try again. What's that? You can try dying and revive. Don't know it. Really... Sorry to let you down. I can whip you to show my thanks for your help. That's dangerous! It's all I can do. Please throw it all out. Yeah? Your final pay... Thanks for your service. Thank you. Stop that! Greedy! And now... Ms Power. Thanks for everything. 'Mis-power'? Here it is! I lose! Don't die! Why?! This. "GUTS Giblet Stew." Wrist slit ridges. It feels so hard! It's really hard! I just had an idea! You're sure? I'm sure it'll work. Brazen, just met... That makes anything OK. It's grating! Grated horseradish! It's amazing! Can I try? It grates horseradish! Give it to me! Not yet. These scars of doubt are mine! Please leave. Don't be stupid! I'm closing now. "Auld Lang Syne" ends everything?! Whatever! Just go! Others are looking for 'Deathfix'. What'll I do? Keep an eye on them? Understood. I'll have Snakeriver Gang members continue their activity. Snacks ready?! Shut up, I'm making them! Ice and oolong tea... And a pocketful of happiness, please! What are you two up to?! Isn't it amazing? Look, salted fish guts! Don't put it all out! It's horrible. Look, a lion and leopard mix! A "leopon". An orange juice and sock mix is an "orock"! What an awful mess! Look! It's Nicholas Cage! It is! Guts-O-Fish Cage! Let's eat! Stop it! It feels rough! That's mean. That was bad. I did nothing wrong. You're the wrist slitter. No problem, I can revive. Show remorse! No way, feeling remorse makes you old. You hear? Look at this... What's that? A monkey arm. It brings people back to life. No way! It's true! I brought Granny back to life with it. One day, in the storehouse, Granny was opening a box. I saw a monkey arm. Granny gave me that box. "It's a monkey arm. It brings people back to life." "Sayoko, use it to bring a loved one back to life." Soon after that, Granny died, I really loved Granny and wanted to revive her. Just like she'd said, I put the monkey arm in her hand. Then I waited in my bed until midnight. The appointed time. "August 05" I had a bad dream. I did, too. Like what? I received a globe and was asked, "Where is the switch?" I said "I don't know," they said "Push India". I pushed India and found that it was a switch. I thought, "Push India, what a great idea." I was impressed. Nonsense, monkey arm revival! That's yesterday's talk today! I brought Granny back. A 'resurrection'. A wake's because people may revive within 24 hours! Just chance? I don't know, but it could be true. Stop that. I said to stop that! If I die by suicide, bring me back. Suicides are bra, zen, face! What? Bra, zen, face. What? Brazenfaced. Say you're sorry. I'm sorry. Hello. Editor-in-chief? OK, I'm coming soon. I'm on my way. You stupid fool! I'm not going! I won't end up like Majima! You're hot, but watch out! Say it, then hang up. Exactly. I know... This year's sun is oddly red. Really, is that so? I'm terribly sorry! Enough. I'm so sorry. Here it is, Mr Eyeball. Alright. Mr Eyeball! Pocket's out. 'Deathfix' is a drug for death revival, Majima looked for it, left a magnetic patch. Snakeriver Gang searched for Majima, but found nothing. Don't singers think, "Why do I have to be so loud at this age?" They don't, so they sing. Well, yakuza are the same. I wonder why I have to look scary at this age. I felt that way when I quit the band. In a band? Yeah, punk. Throwing animal guts on stage. What a waste. Weirdo. It is a guts restaurant. Fight someone your own size. - What's that about?! - Nothing. I'll quit the yakuza! Then what? Join you guys? What are you up to? Looking for Majima. I know! You're looking for Majima! Scattered. - What? - Your memory. Remember something? - You mean me? - Don't know! Then who? Me? It is me! I've got it! Majima was looking for a Master. Huh?! A Master? I knew it! I didn't fit in with yakuza. You say so, but... Humans are hard to figure out. What do you want to be in your next life? Huh? A sea louse. Why?! Well, living hand in hand seems great. Wow! Wet concrete! Endo! Me too! Hey, Endo! Stop. Think of the workers. They're paid by "Monthly". Of course! So what? No way. I lost interest taking off my socks. Shouldn't have hesitated. You quit this, too? I'm a quitter tonight. It's better not to fall in love tonight. Don't tell me! Well? Well what?! After that, we drank until morning. Endo slept in a park. It's hot! A Master... How about it? It is almost like heaven! Of course! You'll put that on after getting clean? No problem! Oh yeah, don't you want to buy this? It's really nice! Don't overdo it. Alright. You want it? How much is it? It's Majima's! How'd you get it?! Where did you get it? Don't 'assk' me that! "Abashiri Prison Tour." Oh my! I'll telephone! My sincerest apology. We'll proceed. Send five of them. Ambulance is coming! What for, I'm OK. But you... I already died once. What do you mean?! I've returned from seeing the realm of death. How could you?! My Master taught me. Your Master? My Master. Your Master?! Where is he? The answer is... Hey! Hey! Are you OK?! And now... Hey! Tell me about that Master! A few days later, Mr Eyeball contacted us. "August 09" A few days later, Mr Eyeball contacted us. Avoid eating meat. Really? Meat is hard on your guts. Don't order it much. Over there! Who? The one with info. About the Master? Well, go check. I thought it was 50 yen... Good afternoon. Hold on! I'll show you! Hey, hey, hey... Hi, Chorori! Hey, carp flag Boss! I was just dealing with this trash. Who's this weirdo? Kind of my little brother. Nice to meet you. Do you happen to know about a 'Master'? A Master? Yes, Master. Actually, I do know. Really? Yes, definitely. Related to this? Probably is. Well, who is it? Will you tell us? I will in return for something sweet to eat. What?! Are you hungry? Like the comic character. Hold on! I'll show you! Forget it, let's go. Boss, can you see Mona Lisa from over here? - Mona Lisa? - Mona Lisa. You owe me a marshmallow desert. Looks like your soul's leaving when you eat that. It does not. - It doesn't? - It doesn't. Looks like your soul's... That's not funny, just stop. It's not supposed to be, you understand?! Further? Boss, here it is. Pressure point Master. "Love Pressure Points." This may be it! No, I don't use these things. Is that so? But you're a Master. I am a pressure point Master. Point Master. Do you know about 'Deathfix'? I don't. It makes people seem dead. Is there such a point? There isn't. He knows nothing. He's the problem. That's right. There is no point! You're a lousy Master. Lousy. Don't insult me! I discovered a new point. It's inside the stomach. Touch it, and you won't catch colds. Just do that to prevent colds. You want to try? - I don't like this guy. - I don't either. Not the Master Majima looked for. Boss, thanks for the sweet. It's OK, enjoy it. I paid for it. That sounds stingy. But we're getting nowhere. Boss, I'll leave after this. Are you so busy? I have work. What work? Old guy tickling. That's a job?! It is. Old guy tickling. Look, her soul's leaving! It's true! Miss, your soul's leaving. Don't bother her. Spirit photo! Spirit photo! What is it?! Excuse us. It had film in it! This? Oh! I wonder if 'Deathfix' really makes you die? We won't know till we try. If we find it, can I try? You want to die? I want to meet my mother. But why? My mother drowned in front of me. That day, I was on the beach watching her swim. She just kept swimming. I wondered how far she would go. I realized she was 2km out to sea. Really? I was eating ice cream at the time, and thought I'd call her when it was done. But she suddenly disappeared. Disappeared? Yeah. I thought she was joking, but she never surfaced. I wonder why I thought I'd finish eating? You didn't use the monkey arm? Mom's body never surfaced. We can't take things back because of tiny details. You can't meet after death. Maybe there's no afterlife. That's true, but... They're ready. They're perfectly done. Thanks to me. "Death Show." Look. Maybe a death revival experience? It could be. I wonder? A festival. Only at midnight. It's still on? It lasts all summer. But you'd better not go. Why not? I just feel it. Break time! It made me happy! Take it easy, or die. Sir, what kind of work do you do? I'm a scholar. Entomologist, I study insects. Break's finished. Why did the photo shop girl say not to go? I have doubts, but I have to go. In any case, the "Death Show". Ladies and Gentlemen! Money. We at the Tokyo Medical Research Center present this "Death Show". Regardless of age, cast your eyes on death, for surely it awaits you! Ladies and Gentlemen. I, Half-Man, am inviting... all of you to visit the realm of death this evening. What is the place we humans wander after our lives are gone? Surely you must want to know? Now, the unfortunate young lady who will die tonight. Here she is. And now, I have a request. Consider what I will now kill... to be nothing but a crab. Otherwise, if it fails to revive from death, every one of you... will be an accomplice in murder. What I am holding here is a very special drug. Breath will cease for minutes after drinking it. And this crab will briefly... wander in the realm of death. It is utterly dead. Heartbeat and breath have ceased, the pupils are dilated. But, please be at ease. On the count of five, she will be revived. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... What?! Another count of five. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Something went terribly wrong. There is no choice, this young lady... must be chopped to pieces! Please be at ease, it is nothing but crab! Yes? What is it? Doesn't this pull tab seem dirty? It gets pushed inside, so dust and stuff will also get in. Not really... If it doesn't bother you, what do you care? Frankly, it's you. It's me? Did a Majima come by here? The cameraman? He did come! He said he wanted to know about 'Deathfix'. So, what is 'Deathfix'? An insect. Is it really?! There used to be lots. They were used for Edo era prison breaks. In what way? It's the Edo era. No one had ever left Kodenma-Cho Prison alive. "If I can't leave the prison alive, I'll leave it dead." "Then I'll have to die once." He seemed dead, his corpse was discarded. But before very long, the heart... began to beat. Aren't there any 'Deathfix' insects now? Any now? Rumor says an old man called Master uses 'Deathfix'. Where is he? Don't ask me that. Majima the cameraman asked me that. You know where Majima is? I wonder if he's still alive? Yakuza and cult people search... Oh! What I just said was half true. I'm half, too! Any clue about that Master? Majima the cameraman... left this. What's that? Magnetic patch! Editor-in-chief, 'Deathfix' seems to be an insect. A guy called Master knows all about it. Police?! Why?! No way, I didn't do anything. Turn right! Why? "Inspection." This is bad. It's you guys. Detective Nakamura, good work. Salute! Excuse us. Get out, open the trunk, and do judo! Give us a break. Immediately! Look! It's firefly-squid relish! Ota! Ota! Sorry! Excuse me. Until next time! Deep kisses are never as good as you expected. I agree. Go back to the police station. Well, that girl's upper lip... has a downy moustache. It feels so ticklish on my mouth. It's really true, women can grow moustaches. What the hell?! He's the one, that lousy journalist. Watch what you say! I see, I see, I see, let's have a little talk. Why? Why?! Because autumn follows summer! Stop that! That's dangerous! They're just trash! A cop says that about us good citizens?! "Spider Web Police Station." What's your link to Snakeriver Gang? There isn't any. And what is 'Deathfix'?! Won't you tell us? What the hell's going on? Talks nonsense... Huh?! This is weird! Hey wait! You want to eat? Eat what? You know Cup Noodles? There's beef in it. We collected it to make a steak. Can I leave now? You cannot leave! I know nothing! You know about 'Deathfix'. Hey, hey, come here. How much do you know about Majima's disappearance? Nothing at all. Why's he missing? 'Deathfix' is a drug to make people die and then revive. Is that so? A religious cult could make use of it. But they can't do it up front. So they had to use a cover. We suspect Majima was killed. Maybe by Snakeriver Gang. Mr Eyeball's gang? Exactly! What's that for?! I'm not involved. You may already be dead. Keeping an eye on me? Exactly! Don't touch my nipple! Shouldn't we go to the police? What a nuisance! Hey, it's Chorori! It is her. Chorori! What happened? A dog bit my ass over there. It hurts! Go to hospital. I'm OK. But maybe you could get me something sweet. You sure eat sweets. Bad for your health. The worst things taste best. I hate healthy things. I know what you mean... You mentioned that Master before, right? Yes. I asked a homeless guy I know, he said there is a Master. Oh?! Where? At Beggar Nest. What is Beggar Nest? A thicket on a sandbank, where a huge number of homeless live. Really? That's too sweet! It is? You knew? I didn't. It is a beggar's nest. A homeless Master is there. I'll laugh if there isn't. Why laugh? Whatever. We'll have to go find out. What?! Is the one called Master here? No! See! Let us go in. No! Only we can enter. Come on, it's OK... What's going on? Mr Sakakibara! Please help. We'll say we're wrong. What's that mean? Boss, leave it to me. Hold on! I'll show you! You're so tall that everybody asks if you play basketball! Control yourself! You guys OK? Silver filling's out. Sausage clip! What'll we do? Let's get him! We tried that and failed. Hold on! I'll show you! Stop that. Other route? No way. Majima got in. But how? Oh! What? It's that ship! With the weird captain. "American Dog" stand. The boat shop's beside it. - The what? - Now I know. Know what?! Where Majima went by boat. Endo and I headed for Beggar Nest by boat, "August 15" Endo and I headed for Beggar Nest by boat, Endo and I headed for Beggar Nest by boat, Oh, oh... Here at last. Who are you?! Majima? The Master. Patch man! Quiet! I heard you. The magnetic patch creates... an aurora above my head. Not an 'aura', an 'aurora'. Danger! Danger! You people... are looking for 'Deathfix'. Of course 'Deathfix' has been in Japan since ancient times. I and those like me have tried it. But 50 long years ago. What does it feel like? In the realm of death? As usual. Completely as usual. Everything is just as usual. Heaven and Hell don't exist. Disappointing... Knowing that made you homeless? Not at all, I lost everything in the stock market. Disappointing... Don't say that! I'd like to try 'Deathfix'. You may not be able to return to this world. Well, it's my job. 'Deathfix' is an insect, right? It is. Majima, explain it to them. Well, first you have to catch 'Deathfix' insects. Carefully extract bodily fluids. Those fluids stop all human functions. What type of insect? It's like this. Is that it? Look at that pattern. Where are they? I don't know at present. But it's said that... women shell divers in the sea use them to dive very deeply. What for? Drinking a tiny bit of 'Deathfix' at the bottom of the sea... allows them to return to the surface of the sea with respiration stopped. That's all I know. I've had enough. He's a strange old guy. True. Majima, are these insects in Japan? They are, but I don't know where. Very hard to find. I wanted them so much. So much... What for? To meet someone. Who? My deceased lover. Twenty years ago, I was on a beach in Cambodia. 'Cambodia' reminded me. Of what? Of what my principal said. "Recently, students don't finish the school lunch." "Meanwhile, the 'referees' in 'Nambodia' are starving." "Please think of them." 'Nambodia referees'! I was remembering! I was covering the Cambodian civil war on the front lines, I had a friend there, MinMin. We'd be together forever. Majima... I have a surprise for you today. That was a surprise. It sure was. I want to meet MinMin again. So you looked for 'Deathfix'. You can come with us. We'll look for 'Deathfix'. I'm kind of wondering. Maybe you shouldn't meet her again. What?! You got back safely. Majima, Sayoko's always attempting suicide. In a hurry to die. You must have really loved her. You didn't even hear him! I know without listening. You have a new love! That's too cheap. I know! You have... a new love! I hate that about you. Wondering about what? Master said there's... an undersea tunnel to walk from Japan to Korea. Here goes... He was in a Japanese Army secret agency, a secret tunnel was dug in wartime. Idiotic! I managed to copy it after one month. "Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel." Also, I found its entrance. I see! It's obvious. You believe it?! I just... Come here! Should I meet MinMin in death, or walk to Korea through the tunnel? What a choice! I wonder if they're back? They said they'd contact us. It's not very nice of them. I'll call them. Please do! The number you called is out of range... They're out of range... Where'd they go to? I wonder? Will you also leave sometime? Don't worry, I'll stay with you. Thank you. Together forever. Thank you! The map says this is the entrance to the Korea tunnel. Why do you believe it? Feels right. Stupid! If it feels right, it's right. What? I'll call from Korea. Make sure you do! Well, I'm off. I'm going too. What?! Let's go together. That's nonsense. I'm serious, for a change. What about 'Deathfix'? Watching him made me want to go. Take care. I'm sorry. Endo, you're really going? Saying goodbye isn't wrong. Yes, it is! Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind? What are they singing? You're making a big mistake. Right, Sayoko? Is this OK? It's OK. No way. "Auld Lang Syne" doesn't end things. They disappeared awfully fast. That's true. It's so wonderful. I don't get it at all. Get out here. What for? Just go. But why?! That's how I feel. No choice, I guess. Got a place to go to? I remember! Lend me that picture. Why? I told you Chorori knows an insect scholar. You didn't tell anyone that. Anyway, I'll ask. OK. See you later. Editor-in-chief, I've managed to find some clues. I can't do that yet. Braindead! Just wait a bit! Please don't start searching. Welcome! Majima must be at Tsurumi by now. He's not that far. I guess he'll fly back. Don't shout. Don't pretend. What about the tunnel? You didn't walk to Korea? Well, it was so cold in there that I came back. Look, it's short sleeves. Insignificant things determine our lives. Just kidding! What?! Kidding, but overdid it. What's going on?! Do that somewhere else! "SAYOKO: Found 'Deathfix'." Deadline in three days. Feeling the heat. "August 28" Deadline in three days. Feeling the heat. In the end, without really knowing why, all of us went in search of the 'Deathfix' insect. We're here. Ouch! What's this? Something crumpling. Here's your order! Business is slow. The season ended on Sunday, a couple of days ago. It seems lonely when summer ends. So, what do beach resort people do in the winter? What I do is none of your business! What's she mad about?! Maybe in a bad mood from peeling an apple poorly. That's not it! She heard him! I'm tense at a resort?! - I wanted to ask. - Right. About insects? Women divers use them... Maybe an old diver knows 'Deathfix'? I heard everything. Such a resort hag? It's OK. Can I have a smoke? Of course. Sergeant's cigarette. Why's that? A bent one like this... was given to an injured private who had bent privates. It was put in his mouth by a sergeant. In this area, the oldest woman diver is Chupa Chups. No idea what she means. "Masayo, is Chupa Chups the one?" "Yes, Chupa Chups knows everything about the women divers." What's going on? I thought I'd act like two people. It's OK not to think. In the old days, there were lots of women divers here. But they gradually became fewer. Why is Chupa Chups called Chupa Chups? You'll know when you see her! We went to visit that old diver, Chupa Chups. No, thanks... City folk are reserved. 'Chupa Chups' is because you suck Chupa Chups? No, it isn't. Perhaps... About 'Deathfix'? Oxygen tanks are used nowadays, so 'Deathfix' isn't needed. Even when diving deeply, 'Deathfix' isn't used any more. In the old days, in those mountains, we used to attract 'Deathfix' and catch them. We would shine a big spotlight late at night. Will they come? They'll come. What if none come, now that we're so hopeful. That's a good joke! Who's been caught shoplifting? Need this right now? I hadn't told you, but... my hometown is submerged because of a dam. You had to tell us now? They're coming! Raise it! OK! Amazing! Well? Not yet? How would I know?! What happened! Bugs are hitting my head! Are you OK? We didn't expect such a lot of insects to come. Chupa Chups said they used to catch 'Deathfix'. But we have to find them. How'll we search? Maybe there are no 'Deathfix'. There are some! Look! That's how we caught 'Deathfix', ticket to the realm of death. Just as patch Master said, killing them slowly in water made red fluids appear. That night I couldn't sleep. It seemed as if everyone except me had died. Or perhaps I'd died first? Maybe death is like this? Deadline in two days. "August 30" Deadline in two days. Are you really going to try 'Deathfix'? The deadline is in two days. Endo will also try? Of course, he's getting paid. You can't do it alone? Why just me? He may not revive. It's OK if I don't?! You're the type that won't be gone. Why's that? People are two types. "Those with moist earwax and those with dry." What? That's not it. Those gone forever, and those gone but not really gone. Endo wouldn't really be gone! Wrong. Endo is the type that would be gone forever. You don't know even that? I do know. What's the "Q" in "Bar-B-Q"? What? I wondered what the "Q" in "Bar-B-Q" is. I don't know. I know! The "Q" in "Quiz" and in "Question". What "Quiz" is this? About what I'm eating. That's not it. That's all, then. What time's the Bar-B-Q? Chorori said it's at 7:00. "It's at seven." Just like her. I'm glad. Let's try before the Bar-B-Q. Try what? 'Deathfix'. Try it now? Deadline's tomorrow. I see. Shall we die together? You don't have to. Why not? You need to watch me try. No way! We'll do it together. Endo, stop always doing everything that I do! How's that? You always just do what I do. Am I a nuisance? You are. I see... I didn't intend to be a nuisance. We may not revive after we try dying. I don't want you involved. Alright, alright, we'll die together! We've come this far, let's cross the River Styx together. It's really OK?! Well, we worked so hard. Dead for how long? Ten minutes? I see. Ten minutes. Can I have bread? Of course, but you just ate. Recently, I get hungry after an hour. Pastry, pastry, pastry, tasty pastry. Boring! Watch out for the charcoal! 'Cornet', trumpet-shaped pastry. What happened?! Was I dead? Hey, are you still dead? Endo! Endo! What's wrong? Guess you're still dead... Hey, it's time to revive! Hey, you're yellow! Endo! Endo! Oh no! What have I done?! Why'd you blow that?! Just a mistake. No more mistakes! Things happen... Get lost! What's that? A Thai woman lives near me. When cats in heat howl, she opens the window, then yells "Get lost!" Just like her! "Get lost!" What are those two up to? Nothing, I guess. Shall I call them? I'll go get them. Cell phone? I'll get mosquito coils too. Thanks. Ambulance! Call an ambulance! What happened?! Just do it now! Endo! Please! Please! It's coming! Endo, the ambulance! Endo. Endo! Answer me! Why did I bother to change? I felt Endo would die if I wore black. "Kiriyama Fire Dept." Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Why?! It's time to eat. You don't get it! What's wrong? Where'll it go to? Why didn't you ask?! What is it? What?! Endo is... But, the Bar-B-Q... Forget about that! Why didn't the ambulance taking Endo wait for me? It seemed odd, but I headed for the hospital. The hospital said no ambulance came. Where did it go to? I called a nearby hospital, they knew nothing. "Endo is the type that would be gone forever." Sayoko's words haunted me. Here all along? I was. You didn't leave? I was here! I called an ambulance! Remember? I didn't answer any telephone calls! But I telephoned! It can't be. "It can't be" is for me to say! You're making fun of a fireman?! Not at all... you don't understand? Is this the only fire station? Thanks. Yes, it is. The hotel called. That would be for here. So why didn't the phone ring?! I have no idea! I just washed it, it went nowhere. This one? This one. Just got it last month. Look. Look, look! Over 35 million yen! - No others? - Just this one. There is one! It's an old, round-looking ambulance! You have one? No, you have one? It's yours? I said that I don't have one! Anyway, Endo had disappeared. They stayed by the sea, I've come back after searching. I didn't find Endo. Where did that ambulance disappear to? A week has passed since then. Strangely, since then, there's been no contact with Sayoko, Mr Eyeball and Chorori. Where did they all go to? Welcome! Somehow, I thought Endo likely was here. Mr Eyeball and Chorori, Sayoko and Majima all drinking together. Mr Eyeball! Seeing Endo's footprints in the concrete made me cry, Still not understanding, I went to a different town. I lived a usual life in a town where I knew no one. After one year, summer once again. What flavors you have? I'll check. Peach, banana, melon, chocolate, strawberry, lemon and... OK, melon please. OK. That's 200 yen. Here it is. Thanks. Did you lose something? What? You lost something. It's in your face. After that, by chance, I got Sayoko's home address, and visited with little hope. Thanks. It's about Sayoko? Did she contact here? Who are you? Her senior, but who is more like her classmate? No, not at all. Well then? I'm not really anybody... Don't mess with me! Who are you? I'm Sayoko's mother. But, that can't be... You seem to be mistaken. Sayoko is no longer here. Is that so? Where is she? You don't know? Sayoko died in the sea 10 years ago. But, that's! It is definitely true. While I ate a Popsicle on the beach, she drowned. If only I had called out to her a little bit sooner... I had absolutely no idea what was going on. I wanted to completely finish the Popsicle before calling. Even such trivial things can change human lives. If Sayoko died 10 years ago, then who was the Sayoko I met? Sayoko's 'mother' had started to eat a Popsicle, Excuse me. Why doesn't she offer me one? It's so hot, I really want a Popsicle. I want one. I want one! I want a Popsicle! A monkey arm?! So this became this and that has... Want some ice cream? But is this really this? It's me! It's me! It's me! Look, he's revived! Don't die carelessly! I was the dead one?! You almost got cremated! Really?! You just barely escaped death. Great! Did you know?! A "pauper's grave" isn't for pop singers? My monkey arm's great! I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm alive! Really alive! I'm alive! I'm alive! "That's how I died and revived with 'Deathfix'." "This was my death experience," "but the realm of death is the same as our living world." "It was probably an insect-induced hallucination," "but even so, dying once oddly cleared my mind." "In any case, being alive or being dead are similar." "So everything in the world seems less significant." But! Because I was dead, I didn't meet the deadline.,. "September 01" Because I was dead, I didn't meet the deadline.,. What's this?! It's no good? Are you still dead? I'm so sorry. Return expenses. In the end, I don't really know if I'm alive or dead. You know, it doesn't really matter! What are you doing? Smokin' a pain relief spray! Endo, what was that about? I said, "Chinese dumpling coffee shop". Why coffee shop dumplings? I don't know. There's a coffee shop with dumplings? Yes. You said... Right, want to try more weird work? 200,000 each. I'll do it! I'm a new man! Hey! Just kidding! I really overdid it! I overdid it! I shouldn't have overdone it! Yusuke Iseya. Suzuki Matsuo.
