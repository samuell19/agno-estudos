Can we get some chocolate? Ha! I don't know about that. I can barely keep up with you as it is. Let's channel some of that energy into helping me start our garden. What about these cedars? Oh... yeah, sure, Justin. Let's get two of them. One for the main garden and one for the guesthouse garden. Ahh! The "guest" garden. How could I forget? Let's start a wee bit smaller, my boy. I concur. All good things take time after all, Mumsy. "Mumsy"? - Ooh! You're just so... - Mom, we're in public! Ooh, but you're just so lovable! Mm! Lovable enough to get a dog? Oh, ho! Good one! It would not be a day in the life of Justin without the "D-O-G" word being mentioned at least half a dozen times. You literally work at a vet's office. Don't rescues come through all the time? Let's focus on bulbs today. Okay? Someday, buddy. Someday. Just... not today. Okay? Let's toodley-doo these back to our estate! "Toodley-doo," Mom? Grab a bag of dirt. It's that same number. I'll call them back. Tonight, it is you and me. Anybody home? I forgot about Cassie. Oh, there you are! Whatcha doing? We gotta be at the restaurant in T-minus 30 minutes. Sorry, I completely forgot. Justin and I were doing a little pre-spring gardening session. You "forgot"? It's Galentine's! But, hey, I mean, who am I to interrupt mother-son bonding time? Haven't you two done Galentine's every single year since high school? That means it's tradition. You raised a smart boy. But we still have... I see what this is. You want me to leave so you can have the house to yourself. I don't know if this whole fresh-dirt look is gonna fly at the restaurant, so why don't you go get changed? I'll let them know we'll be ten minutes late. Would you maybe plant the last few bulbs and clean up a little bit, please? Aye-aye, Mom. Thank you! Okay. Ten minutes. Nice! Are you still getting those phone calls? Yep. They're breathing down my neck. How about we do double Galentine's next year, when I have my financial situation sorted out? How about I just cover you, no questions asked? You're gonna spend tonight with people who love you. Okay? You deserve that. You know they're gonna ask how I'm doing and... what am I gonna say? That I'm a nearly-broke divorcee who hasn't been on a decent date since Alan left? That I've been looking for a second job for months, and I haven't even gotten a single interview? When did you become this person? What person? A Debbie Downer. Ho, ho! Excuse me? I should ground you for that! I mean, I was gonna say "Dawnie Downer," but, yeah... we've always relied on you to be the positive one. If anyone needs me, I'll be eating leftover pizza. You should go, it'll be fun. Hi, it's Dawn. Sorry I missed your call. Please leave me a message. Oh... Dawn DeVries. I know you're there. Here's the up-to-date foreclosure files, Ben. I still got one more to wrap up. DeVries... The one you haven't reviewed. She's 120 days behind, and still avoiding me like the plague. Have we already sent out the notice-of-foreclosure letter? I've got a stamp on it. It'll go out on Monday. And you've tried every other option? Because you know my philosophy. I know... "Benevolent Ben." "Give every person the benefit of the doubt." She's re-financed her debt twice, but it's only growing, and it's kind of hard to talk to someone who won't pick up the phone. I can't say you're the voice I'd wanna hear on the other end of the line either. Ouch. No! No, no, no. You're great! It's the situation. You know what I mean. Yeah, I do. Well, I'm done for the day. You right behind me? Uh... no, I've got another email to send. - Okay. - Oh! Hey. Great work today. Thanks, Ben. You too. Great work ruining lives. Okay. So I told the girls we're gonna be a few minutes late and we are on our way. Oh... sweetie, you're gonna get through this. It's... really, really bad. I haven't been able to recover from Alan's bad investments, then the car broke down, and insurance and... house payments... I don't even know how many of those I've missed. The debt counselor I've been seeing is saying that... bankruptcy might be the only way out. Alan always said I wouldn't be able to make it without him. No. No-no-no. Remind me... What were you voted in our senior year? "Most optimistic." Where did she go? I miss her. I miss her, too! Okay, well, you heard your son. Come out with us girls. Let us help you get that smile back. Come on, even if it's just for one night! There you go! That's better. Leaving in two! Are you ready? I'll be right down. Mm! Do you remember these? Oh, wow! Yes. You couldn't stop making those in high school. What did you call them again? "Blessing bracelets." Oh, yeah. You find one good thing God has blessed you with for each bead. Right. Here, let me try. Oh, let's see... um... my Galentine's gals. My job at the church choir. A hot cup of cocoa on a chilly day. Ooh! And... uh, the first bloom of spring. Four beads, four blessings. Alan thought they were silly. It's tough to see you struggle, tch, but... counting a blessing or two... it might be a good way to start. Okay. We should never have stopped making these. Now we can start counting our blessings again. You're a blessing, my friend. Let's go celebrate friendship. Ooh, what's this? From my lips to... It's a piece of jewelry, Cassie! It's not a magical lamp with a genie. Okay, the gals are waiting. They need help. - After you. - Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks great. Um... I'm gonna meet you at the table. Okay? Yeah, okay. Hey. Hi, guys! Ahem. Excuse me, sir? I saw the sign in the window and I'm wondering who I can speak with about the position? Oh. Uh, that would be the owner, Norm. Oh. I, um, I don't have my resume on me right now, but I'm wondering if you could tell him, um... My name is Dawn Spencer, and, uh... I would really love to be a waitress here. Really? This restaurant has always been about breaking bread, and sharing laughs, and telling stories... and I could really use the joy of that connection in my life. If you could please tell Norm that he won't find a harder-working, more people-centered person than I am, and... I was voted "Most Optimistic" my senior year of high school. Norm Dobbins, owner of this establishment. Nice to meet you. Sorry, what? Well, obviously, you've got passion... Passion we need. When could you start? - To our fearless... - and optimistic! Yes! And incredibly optimistic friend, Dawn, for successfully securing her second job. - To Dawn. - To Dawn! I start tomorrow! I mean, I can't remember the last time I was this happy on Valentine's Day. Aww! And to think, he was the owner. It was just a blessing in disguise, I guess. Well, bravo, lady. Bravo! And on that note... You know what time it is? Chocolate? - Chocolate... - Chocolate. Hey, Mom. So... I've got great news. You're getting me a dog? You're killing me, kid! No! Not a dog. Better. I got... a job. I got a job! ♪ A second job! - ♪ She's got a job! - ♪ I got a job! ♪ A second job! Isn't that amazing? That's amazing, Mom! Why is that amazing? Buddy! It's amazing because... your mom needed a little more help, and this is exactly what I needed. So this means you'll be going to Grandma and Grandpa's a few nights after school. I can be alone on a Monday night... but not after school? Well, I would just feel better knowing that you had a decent meal in you, and someone to help you with homework. You want Grandpa to help me with my homework? Good point. Grandma will help. This is it. This is the turning point. Soon, we'll be able to get a third garden for our second guesthouse, my boy. Why the long face? Grandma and Grandpa... I love visiting them. They just... aren't you. Oh, buddy. I promise, this won't be for long. Yes, we may have a little less time together for a short while, but... this will allow us so many more adventures in the long run. You know... a dog would really help. I'll need a third job for that. For my second job. Yes. Mom, I start today. After work at the vet's office. Justin will be heading over after school, around 4:00. Your father and I love spending time with Justin. It'll be great. So, now, remember... Homework before video games. And pizza only once a week. Yes. We did raise you, if you remember. Do you really need to work this hard? For now, yes, I do. You know, if you need some help, your father and I are happy to give you... No. Mom, no. Please, you've done enough already. Watching Justin is a huge help, thank you. Of course. Your father and I are holding you in our prayers. It'll turn around. Oh, hang on. Mom, I have to take this other call. It's important, but... thank you very, very much. I love you. I love you, too. Hello? Yes, this is Dawn Spencer. Uh, used to be DeVries. Hi, Jordana. Yes, I've seen all your calls. I'm sorry, I, um... I just needed a plan, but I have some really, really good news. I got a second... Wait. Um, a letter is coming? A letter for what? Dawn? Dawn? Don't you think you should give Ms. Whitson little Toby back? Hmm? Little Toby, dear. Ms. Whitson's dog? Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. Yes, of course. Oh... come here. Oh. Ohh... And weren't you saying that Toby did...? Great! He was great. He took his shots like a man. Oh! One who doesn't run away when the going gets tough. Oh... Thank you. Oh, Mummy's so proud of you! What a good boy. Are you all right, dear? I'm sorry, Greta. I'm just a little bit out of it. Well, is there anything I can do? No, thank you. I don't know what needs to be turned around, but if anyone can do it, I'm sure it's you. - I'm really gonna try. - No "try"... do. Did you just Yoda me, Greta? Lolly. Lol... Lolly! Lolly, heel! Lolly, heel! Heel. Sit, Lolly! Lolly! Lolly! - Oh. - I'm sorry. She's quite the kisser there. So much energy. I don't know how to harness it sometimes. Nice to meet you, Lolly! It's okay. Sometimes, dogs like Lolly, who have boundless energy, have owners who can... Let's get her checked in. Come on, Lolly! Let's go. We'll take Exam Room One. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Come on. Lolly's dad, you can come with us. Come on. Lolly's new to our system? Yeah. We just moved to the neighborhood. Oh. Well, welcome. Thank you. You picked a great time of year to move. The lilies that line Main Street always bloom right around Easter. It's beautiful. Let me guess... You're here for ear scratching? Yeah! Hmm. How'd you know that? You're good at this. No, I just noticed earlier, she was scratching her ears and they're a little bit red. We will get her feeling more comfortable in no time. So, how long have you been working with animals? Just a few years. She's very sweet. Don't let her fool you. She may be sweet in public, but I can't tell you how many shoes she's chewed up. It's like she's always running on four cups of doggie coffee, or something. Has she done any training? This is amazing. She's never this calm with anyone. And, yeah, believe it or not, she has had training, but I think she goes to daycare and she learns new tricks from old dogs. Oh. So, uh... excuse me... You can teach a new dog... Old tricks! Yeah, I suppose you can. That's right. Well, there is a dog park on 7th and Washington. Maybe you could run her there? Well, I'd rather just pay you to come over and scratch her ears. That was weird! I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. It's not weird. It's just my ear-scratching rate is a little steep. Dr. Sims will be in at any moment. You stay put. You too, Lolly. Okay. So, next up, we have Xena the German Shepherd. She's coming in for her annual shots? Yup. Oh, Mr. Preston just called to say they're running a little late. Allergies! Excuse me? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh! - Allergies... The doctor said it was allergies to a ragweed local to the area. - Oh. - Just a few drops under the ears, should clear up in no time. - That's great. - Yeah. Can I ask you a quick question? Well, technically, you just did. Heh. Okay. A second quick question? Yeah. Of course. You know that dog park you mentioned earlier? Yes. I was wondering if maybe you'd like to join me there. To help with Lolly? No, not exactly. I was wondering if you'd like to go on a little... doggie date. Oh... uh, I wish I could. I've just got... I've got a lot going on right now, and, um, so... Yeah. It probably isn't a great time, but, um, thank you for asking. Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Phew! I mean... - Whew! - Because, you know, I... I couldn't go either, I am way too busy. Oh! I don't have time for a doggie date... - Perfect. - or a normal date. Great. So, okay, well, then it's settled. - Totally settled. - Yes. Great. Okay. I'll see you later. Nice to meet you, Lolly's dad. Oh, I'm... I'm Ben, by the way. Dawn. Okay! I... will see you around. - Okay. - Come on, Lolly. What? It's been a while. Too long. I wish it were as simple as using life as an excuse. It's really hard right now. I'm anxious about my new job. And I am so scared to lose the house. Help me focus on my many blessings during this time of uncertainty. I am so grateful for everything that you've given me, and I only ask that I hear your guidance. Point me in the right direction. Guess you'll have to show me where that is another time. I don't wanna be late for my first shift. Thanks, sweetheart. Always thank your cooks. If the cooks are happy, the food comes out quicker. If the food comes out quicker, the customers are happier. And if the customers are happier, then I get a bigger tip. And if I get a bigger tip... You're happy. The circle of restaurant life. Here we go! Roasted chicken special and maple-glazed salmon. And two pastas. All you lovebirds, enjoy. Now, if you're great, they're great, and then the tips are... Great. Well, I need them to be really great, really fast. Any tips? Tips on tips? I can tell you're a sweetheart, so I'm going to give you... the secret sauce to Flancy's Server Success, but you gotta make it your own. Please. I'm all ears. Well... if you wanna get a really great tip, I like to give diners a little something extra to enjoy. Mints... for the adults, butterscotches for the kids. It's that simple? It's that simple! Of course, I pay for it myself, but it comes back ten-fold. People really respond to a little bit of generosity and a personal touch. That sounds easy enough, but I wouldn't know what to give. That, my dear, is up to you... but it's less about what it costs and more about what it means. But hands off the mints and the butterscotches... Those are mine. Come on, follow me. The shrimp cocktail... didn't we get that the last time? That was good. Happy Valentine's Day to this lovely family. My name is Flancy, and this is Dawn. She'll be shadowing me tonight. Hi, everyone. Hi, Lolly's Dad. Hi. It's still "Ben." Right. These are Lolly's grandparents. This is Rox and Vern. Welcome, Ben, and Lolly's grandparents. You know this young man? - Well, we met today. - Oh! - It's nice to see you again. - Yes, you too. A happy coincidence. My parents and I... We love this place. We kind of have a tradition. Every Valentine's Day, if I don't have a date, uh... Uh, we like, uh... I think it's great that you're here, and we will take good care of you. Drinks? - House white. - A glass of red. I bet you want a beer. Yes! I would love a beer. Uh, any recommendations? I'm gonna surprise you. Great. We'll be back with those drinks. Well, that young lady seems lovely. Dawn? Yes. Uh, she's great, yeah. She works at the vet as well. I was there today with Lolly. She was so patient with her, and you know how Lolly can be. You should ask her out. Truth be told, I did ask her out today at the vet. - And? - And... she said she was busy, so... That's that. Well, maybe you should take her word for it as opposed to thinking you're not worthy. I don't know. Maybe I should ask Flancy out, see what she says. I already got a ring, honey, but I appreciate the compliment. A local pilsner. Pilsner? Thank you, that's my favorite. Uh, cheers. Cheers. That mint was a nice touch. I'm gonna catch up with you guys. Just give me a sec, okay? Five-star service, if I do say so myself. Well, that's good to hear on my first night. This is your first night? Wow, you're a natural. Well, I hope so. Oh. There was something I, um, wanted to ask you. Sure. But remember, I'm busy. Oh... Right. Of course. I was wondering if maybe you wanted a dog-walker. Someone to take Lolly to the park to help her burn off all that extra energy. Don't you work hard enough? Oh! Not... not me. My son, Justin. He really wants a dog, and it's not the right time, and I was thinking that maybe he could help with Lolly, and that would help him, and it would be a win-win. Right. Is he as good with dogs as you are? Well, you know, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree with the dog from the... bone from the... doghouse? Okay, yeah, I think that's a great idea. Thank you. I will tell him tonight. - He'll be thrilled. - Absolutely. Tell him to give me a call... and we can set up a schedule. I look forward to meeting him. Perfect. Thank you. Oh, and just so you know... I'm kind of hoping that he's going to see how much work it takes to have a dog. - The words of a mother. - Mm-hmm. A good mother, by the looks of it. Okay. Don't lose that number. Oh, I won't. I promise. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Whoa. Just a quick heads up... The DeVries letter was sent a few days ago. Uh, the... the Divincenzo Or DiBlase? "DeVries." - DeVries? - Devries. Anyway, I don't know how she's gonna make it. Foreclosure's set for end of first quarter, just after Easter. But she did finally make contact, actually. I'm supposed to meet with her now. Well, did you offer to reinstate the loan, or what about bankruptcy? That's a last resort. But she would keep her home. There are multiple lines of credit, overdrafts, a car loan that she has skipped several payments on. Look... being in this deep, she's gotta be overwhelmed, so go easy on her. And reassurance is good. You know, I can't remember the last time you smiled at work. Well, for us, this is all just a stack of papers, but for people like Devries, it's their whole lives. You know as well as I do that if we took our jobs personally, we would all quit... day one. Yeah, you're right. And I have a meeting with some long-time clients. Time for me to tell them about foreclosure. Not personal... business. Right. For my health. For the strength to go to this meeting. For the car I drove here. And for putting Ben in my path again last night. - Ms. DeVries? - Yes. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Please, follow me. Ms. DeVries... Actually, it's Spencer. I stopped using my married name. "Dawn" is best. Well, Dawn is easy. Now, you said you had some encouraging news? I do. I got a second job. Okay. What is this other job? I'm waitressing evenings at the River Rapids Cafe. With the extra hours and tips, I should be able to make a dent in the debt. You received our letter, right? Yes, I did. And I know it'll take more than a few good shifts at the restaurant. Here... is a check in good faith to start. Thank you for this. Dawn... trust me, this is the worst part of my job, but we are under strict guidelines at the bank. And... And just being frank, it's gonna take a lot more than this... to turn around your foreclosure. I-I understand, but I... I have hope. Mom, I taught Lolly to "sit" and "stay" on our first day. Impressive! So... now you know how great I'll be with my own dog. After a single one-hour session? Nice try, bud. Although, I do think you may have a future career in sales. Like Dad? Well... you do have his charm and persistence. I miss him. I know, buddy. I haven't seen him in forever. Well, he's got a lot going on. Yeah... I guess. Why did he leave? Well... your dad tried his best, but he was having a hard time, and, uh, he had to leave to figure some things out. But I want you to know he always has, and he always will love you... no matter what. Maybe he just needed a dog to make him happy. Oh, boy, you're relentless! Yeah, maybe... Maybe a dog would have helped. What are these? Blessing bracelets. Each bead is a chance to say something you're grateful for, and I had a bunch of leftover supplies, so I was thinking I could give them to customers at the restaurant... A little personal touch. Mostly, I think it might make people smile. I like to see you smile, too. - Can I give it a try? - Yeah, of course. Video games. Mm-hmm. My first walk with Lolly. Pizza. Oh... definitely pizza. That my mom is thinking about getting me a dog. Nice try. Well, Mumsy... if I do say so, I'm starting to feel a smidge better already. Oh! Well, that is amazing news, young chap. Shall we tally-hoo? Can you bring that? Thank you. Yeah. Whenever you're ready, and that's just a little something from me to you. Anything else, ma'am? No, just the check. And that's a little something extra from me. I-I... I don't wear jewelry. Well, you don't have to wear it. Each bead represents a blessing you can count. Whether you're having a bad day or a good one, it's just a little reminder. Thank you. First time with Pearl, huh? I couldn't get the slightest smile out of her. Yeah, she used to come in here every single week with her husband. And now it's just Pearl. He passed about six months ago. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Yeah. So... she's just hurtin'. It's nothing personal. Forgiveness. How about for today... can you be with Justin? I know he misses his Dad. Alan has been gone so long, and it seems like, lately, Justin is losing hope. Like I did. But forgiveness? Hmm? That's your solution for the mess Alan left me in? My trust, my heart, my family... all broken. Um, why don't you guys get started warming up, and I'll be with you in just a sec, okay? It is so good to see you here again. It doesn't hurt, does it? Oh, I've been so inconsistent with the weekly services. I just can't find time. I have a feeling He understands. Hey. I'm still wearing the bracelet. Do you remember how we got started with these in junior year? Of course I do. You remember? Mm-hmm. I was going through that awful breakup. I called you, crying. Mm-hmm. And you came over. Yeah. We ate a lot of ice cream. Whew, yeah. And we made bracelets all night. Still wearing 'em after all these years. I mean, if they helped us through a hard time when we were 17, why not at any age? Why not at any age? Justin's already so great with Lolly only after a couple days. He's gonna have her doing back-flips by Easter. Well, with that kid, anything's possible. Spending time with Lolly has been great for Justin. Thank you for letting him help out. Of course. Hey, can I ask you something? You can always ask me something, I just might not always answer. Is... Is Justin's dad around? 'Cause Justin mentioned him a few times, and I didn't wanna dig any deeper, but... just curious. He's here and there. Um... he hasn't surfaced in a while. Uh... he texts to let us know he's okay and to check in on Justin, but he left after the divorce, and we haven't seen him in person since. How do you feel about that? Jury's still out. Justin really loves his dad, and I know his dad loves him. It's complicated. That is hard. Yeah, it was. Thanks. Okay, now I get to ask you a question. Ah. Well... you can ask, but I may not answer. Oh. Touché. Have you ever been married? Uh... yes. Married to my job. Mm. Currently seeking a separation, I think. What do you do? I work in finance, and, uh... on a beautiful day like this, with a beautiful... new friend, I'd rather talk about something way more interesting. Like... that piece of bling on your wrist. What is that? It's... I actually just started wearing it again. It's something I came up with in high school. I use it to count my blessings... Things that I'm grateful for. A blessing per bead. Does that sound silly to you? Lolly. My mom. My dad. And... new friendships. It's not silly at all. So, does it work for new blessings every day, or is it...? Yeah. You can do as many as you want. Ho, ho, ho! Your son is incredible. He sure is. You know, you were right about that whole... doghouse and the bone... One doesn't fall far from the other. Am I the doghouse? Well, you came up with it. Hey, gals. Do you remember these? I'm bringing them back. Cassie already has hers. These are for you. Blessings bracelets! Never hurts having a reminder to give thanks. Stylish, too. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'll, uh, see you all in a second. Okay. A table for one. All right. Right this way. Here you go, and I will be back to take your order. Uh, uh... wait a moment. Please. Um... Thank you... for this. Uh, your... your gift has reminded me that there are still small things that I can be thankful for. Honestly, I... I can only count one, so far, but, um, this one is... this one is George. And, um... Yeah. Every moment with George was s-special. Thank you for sharing that. You broke Pearl. What'd you do to her? I suppose I just opened up her heart a little bit. Well... it, uh, certainly outdid the mints. Oh, by the way, there's a group of women over there... They wanna see you. They said you served them a couple of days ago. Yeah, sure. You're makin' me proud, honey! Hello, ladies. Good to see you again, Dawn. We were all just talking about your bracelets. Oh... How something so simple has really brought us joy in so many ways. I'm so glad. These would be perfect Easter gifts to give out to our women's prayer group. So... where can we buy them? I'm sorry, buy them? Yes. Easter's around the corner and we'd love 30 of the ones with the pastel beads. How much are they? Let's call them affordable. And... bulk orders get a healthy discount. Can we have them by Friday? Friday? I have a lot of shifts. Yes, you can. Because we will help! Apologies for eavesdropping, but this lovely waitress is our best friend. And we're her bracelet worker-bees. Soon to be sold online! Friday it is. I love these. They're great, because you can mix and match them to go with anything. Gorgeous and versatile. With plenty of blessings. Well, I'm sold! Who would like hot tea? - Ooh, I'll take one. - Please. Dawn, what do you think of the homepage? It's amazing. I'm so glad you like. Once you look over the copy, we can take it live. Okay... I think this brings us to 21. So close, you guys. Keep going. How's it going over there, Mr. Spencer? Oh, uh, not so good in the first half, but I'm-I'm sensing a comeback. Chuck, you support your daughter and focus on the beads. I'm getting 'er done one bead at a time. How's your supply? We're good, Dad. Thank you. Oh, good, you're here! And a day early on the delivery, too. I hope your prayer group enjoys these. Oh, they will. So, Dawn, the thing about a strong community of women is that, well, word spreads... fast. And it turns out that there are a lot of people in need of reminders for their blessings. That's great. And that means? You've got a very big order coming your way for Easter. How big? Wha... 500? That's amazing. I know! And I keep getting phone notifications for online orders. The website just went up a couple days ago. But here's the thing... I'm gonna have to apologize to everyone and tell them I can't fulfill all the orders. What? No, why? I had no idea they'd be so popular. And I can't ask you to give up more of your time. So, I'm going to make as many as I can myself after I meet with the bank. Mm-hmm. Don't say no just yet. This is remarkable. So, you've been making money with these? I-I know it doesn't seem like much, but to some people, it's a whole lot. Mm. Listen, I have to ask. Easter isn't far away, Jordana, and I know we're climbing a mountain here, but... is there any chance of getting an extension? That's a little above my pay grade, but let me check. Can we make any extensions right now? I just have somebody who's asking. No, I can't. Okay, okay. I'm sorry, Dawn. My boss, he needs everything closed before the end of the first quarter. If there were any leeway, we would find it. I'm sorry. I understand. Um... please, keep the bracelet. Oh... thank you. Have a nice day, Jordana. Yeah, you too. Yeah. How'd she take it? About as well as someone can. You okay? Uh, not great. All this foreclosure stuff... You know, it's not what I signed up for. You know, my parents owned a small printing business their whole lives... and we were so connected to the community. That's who I took this job for... To help people build businesses. Approving loans. Partnering with clients to help them achieve success. Ben, you've got a great heart... but we both work within the confines of a system that makes that challenging. Well, then, maybe I can find a way to help people outside the system. See? I was right. All heart. You never give someone more than they can handle, right? Because it sure doesn't feel like that right now. I just... need more time. Dawn. How nice to see you here again. Hi, Pastor Amelia. Listen, I'm sorry I haven't been coming in regularly on Sundays. The vet has me working on the weekends now, and... My dear, there is no need to apologize. We believe in a very forgiving God. Forgiveness. That word keeps coming up whenever I'm around here. Well, it's a good word, isn't it? It is. It isn't easy. No. No, you're right about that. Just keep letting God know what's in your heart, okay? You too? Cassie is a great saleswoman. These are a wonderful little tool, aren't they? You wanna know what my first blessing is? The Easter season. Why is that? It's a season of renewal. I see people change for the better during this season more than any other. Goodnight, Dawn. Goodnight. Well, look... you may not like math class, but trust me, you are gonna use a lot of it in daily life. Not if I'm a highly sought-after dog trainer. Hey, can you tell your mom I can't come in tonight? I gotta get back to the office. You need a vacation. You're telling me. Okay, have a good night. Say hi to your mom for me. Bye, Lolly. Ruff! Let's go, Lolly. For the hardest-working mom I know. Alan. Hey, Dawn. Well... Well... Uh, I'm not... I'm not really sure where to begin. Three years. Sorry, what was that? Three years ago. That's the last time we saw you. Has it been that long? I've texted. It's not the same. Look, Dawn, I... I couldn't let Justin see who I really was... a failure. And I didn't... I didn't know how to dig my way out... our way out. I mean, I-I thought those were good investments. We had each other, our family. Why now? Why are you coming back now? To make things right. Okay? I-I couldn't show my face to you... or-or to Justin... until I'd figured out where I went wrong and I'd fixed it. Okay? And that's what I've done. I've worked tirelessly... tirelessly to get things back on track, and now... Dawn, I... I can help. I don't think you understand how deep the hole was that you left us in. You walked out when I needed you the most. I know. Okay? I know. I'm sorry. I am... I am so, so sorry, Dawn. Could you ever forgive me? You should probably go. I don't wanna wake Justin up. I don't know how he would take this. Dawn, Dawn, I... Shh. Just give me a chance, okay? I... I'm apologizing to you. I'm saying sorry for everything that I put you through. You can't just expect to walk back in here like nothing happened. I don't. Okay? But I... I just... I just need you to give me another chance. I failed you both once. I can't do that again. Let me help you save the house. And then what? Well, maybe there could be a place for me in it again? I need some time. But, hey... check that out. That's yours. Cash it. There's gonna be a whole lot more coming the next couple weeks, I promise. I can't accept this. You probably need it. No. No, Dawn. There's other things that I need a whole lot more. Well, I'll be around. I love you. Wow, he really said he's sorry? Yes, over and over. And he's got a job? That pays actual money? That's what he tells me. He even left me a check. I haven't deposited it yet. I mean, how do you feel? Honestly? I think I felt a little sad for him. You know, we built this life together. We really, truly loved each other. And then we just lost it all over bad investments and... broken promises. Yeah. And I also feel really angry. You know, the divorce broke me. I haven't been able to open my heart up to anybody since. And, just like that, he wants back into our lives? You know, when he left, all I wanted was to feel like I could do this on my own, and lately, I feel like I actually can. And I am so proud of you, my friend. Oh, we gotta go. It's Easter-basket night in five minutes, we're gonna be late. I'm so sorry we're running a little bit late. Dawn... no apology necessary. With how busy you've been, the fact that you'd volunteer your free time to the church says everything. I'm just gonna go let Sandra know I can only deliver about 200 of her bracelets before Easter. Yeah, that's the thing. The only way you'll ever make enough to fulfill the order in time is with reinforcements. Reinforcements? Follow me. Hey, girlfriend! I don't understand. I thought we were supposed to be making Easter baskets. Cassie told me all about your big order and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to help. That's the beauty of a community like this... we all support each other. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. Pearl! We're happy you made it. You know, George loved volunteering here. He was a blessing. My husband would've loved you. Okay, what are we all waiting for? Let's make some bracelets! Hi! Uh, sorry I'm late. There's a man who knows how to make an entrance. There's a spot by a lovely young woman there. Thank you. Hi. Ben! So nice to see you. - Hi. - Hi. You're here. I am. Why? Well, I stopped by the River Rapids Cafe, hoping for a late-night burger, and... hoping to see you, and Flancy said you were here, so I came right over. Everyone, this is Ben. Hi, Ben! Wow! Now, this is the work environment I've been looking for. Hello, everyone! Thank you for the warm welcome. Okay, I am here to serve. This is the Ben she isn't going out with, right? The one and only. That's him. You know, maybe this is the next big thing. Hey, how about this... "Dawn's Designs." - I like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It's a good business name. Okay, so how do we do this? - Okay. I've lined you up. - All right. And you just feed this... - Okay. - through. Okay. I see it. Actually... Thank you for helping tonight. Of course. I had a blast. Your friends, all the churchgoers, even Pearl... Pearl! Everybody was fantastic. Well, I always say I won the lottery. - Hey. - Thank you. Watch your head. - That one. - Ah. Um, so I was thinking, if you ever need help with this bracelet business, you know, I'm pretty good with numbers, so... It's not really a business, but, uh... I suppose it could be. Oh, I think you'd make an amazing entrepreneur. Why is that? You're personable. You're resilient, adaptable. Beautiful. Successful entrepreneurs are beautiful? Sorry. I, uh... I kinda went off-script there. But I'd need to spend some more time with you to add to the list of qualities... when you have time to spend. I have a good feeling that my schedule's going to free up soon if... things keep going the way they are with the bracelets. Great. Pencil me in. I will. Well, um... - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Thank you for meeting me. Seeing you yesterday... well, I just needed to see you again. Alan, I don't know what you... Please cash the check. It's not gonna bounce. Well, I appreciate that. It would nearly get our house payments caught up. Believe it or not, my actual bonus was twice that much. But I invested the other half. Invested it? No, don't worry. Okay, I know that that word can be... uh, triggering, but I have an advisor now. All right? And we're going all-in on this new start-up. He thinks it's gonna be huge. Knowing who I am... knowing who I can be, having a community of friends who support me. What are you doing? Do you remember these bracelets? I used to make them. A blessing for each bead. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, those are cute. I'm selling them. To pay off the debt? Mm-hmm. When, by the time Justin graduates college? Excuse me? Now, look... they... they're nice, okay? But you're not gonna have to do that anymore. You can count on me. You should... take this back. Honey, you don't... You don't have to do that. I've changed! So have I. I am a capable woman who can climb out of a financial mess I didn't even make and raise a kind, smart son. I know I let you down before... These bracelets have changed the most important thing about me... my belief, okay? Now, just focus on the one thing we actually can do together, and that's Justin. Texting is not enough, Alan. You need to make time to see him. I know. I know, I want him back in my life. I actually believe that. He would love that. Call him tomorrow. I will. I promise. Goodnight, Alan. Dawn... Justin? Come on, Grandma's here, it's time to go. Did I make the biggest mistake of my life last night? You're proving again and again what can be accomplished with faith. You know what, Mom? You're right. I just get so overwhelmed sometimes, I forget. Well, you have a lot on your plate. Oh. I'll get it. - Hi... Oh. - Hi! You must be Ben, Lolly's dad? Yes, I am. Oh. Well, it's wonderful to meet you. I'm Mary, Dawn's mom. - Mary. Nice to meet you. - Oh... Oh! Justin, please don't keep Grandma waiting. Hi. What brings you here? Hi, Ben. - Hey. - Is Lolly here? No. I'm sorry, kiddo, she's at home. You guys are leaving? No, no, no, it's okay. I... I have a second, but then I have to get to the restaurant. - But we are off. Yeah. - Okay. - It's been a pleasure. - Likewise. Mm. - Come on, Justin. - Bye, Mom. Bye. Homework first! Yeah, yeah. Um... so, I have... a surprise for you. Oh, my gosh. You designed this? Yes. I'm a man of many talents. - You don't like it? - No. No, I love it. I do. I really do.

Happy to spend time together. You're in a fun mood. Well, things are finally starting to come together. Well, that's good. I mean, taking this bracelet and turning it into a working business... That is a big challenge. I'm proud of you. Thank you. It has been a challenge, but it's been fantastic. I mean, the community coming together... I love it. It's been so special. You said your parents owned a small business, right? Yeah, that's right. This was Puggy's Ice Cream Shoppe. Oh, I loved it when I was a kid. They had this long glass case filled with ice cream. It wasn't a business, it was an experience. The kind of place where it's impossible to choose? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. All my friends and I were so sad last year when the owners retired and closed up shop. It made me start to think, what if I had... my own shop, and I sold my bracelets, and other jewelry, maybe soaps and oils from local vendors? Like an old-time apothecary. I love that idea. Obviously, it's a pipe dream. Well, do you know the saying, "Get out of the boat"? Yes, I do. But I'm having trouble just standing in the boat, let alone getting out of it. Dawn, are you kidding me? After what you've been through, I think you're a lot stronger than you think. You know... I thought I was gonna have my first kiss here. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Right here? - Mm-hmm. Well, I guess everything happens for a reason. Maybe. Well, that was a cherry on top. I suppose I should ask you out again. I'd like that. Hello, this is Dawn. Dawn. I have got a blessing for you. You've caught up on your house payments, so all that is remaining is your credit-card debt and the car loan. My boss said today that he's extending your deadline to the middle of the month. Wait, really? Yes. He is impressed by the progress that you've made. Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it. Well, believe. I will. I... I do. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, keep it up. ♪ So you catch me when I fall, right? ♪ ♪ And you hear me when I call, crying ♪ ♪ And you'll fix me when I'm broke, right? ♪ ♪ That's all I need to know Oh! - What's going on here? - Well... A department-store buyer came in for dinner a couple of weeks ago. Gerwig's Department Store wants to stock your bracelets. A thousand bracelets? And they want them on the shelves by Easter and throughout the spring. And they are ready to advance 50% to secure the order. Easter is less than a week away. Well, here's to Dawn and her bracelets! A ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. And that good things come... to those who believe. ♪ Believe, believe, believe believe in your love... ♪ I can't believe it. All of you here to make bracelets. Well, we're here for you, Dawn. - Where's Ben? - Yes, Ben? He's working late. He wishes he could be here. We wish he could be here, too. Okay. May I please have everyone's attention? Please? All of you are just a wonderful reminder of the power of community. Saying "thank you" isn't enough for all of the love that you've shown me and my bracelet business, and I would be honored to give back. So I'd like to announce that 15% of all Blessing Bracelet sales... will be going to the church. Now, let's get out there and send out more blessings. Dawn, that is so generous. Are you sure you can afford to do that? There is no price I can place on the generosity of everyone here. And I just found out that my house is caught up. I think I can finally do it... Get out of this hole. I am so proud of you. Well, I did it with a little help from some friends. And one very big one. Dawn, my dear. Your generous offer will go straight to our Youth Mission trips. I'm so glad it will help. I want to thank you for bringing me back to God. It turns out He never moved... I did. Dawn! A welcome surprise. I wanted to come in person to hand you a check for the remainder of my credit-card debt before the original deadline. You did it in such a short amount of time. It's... It's amazing. So... what's your secret? Well, let's just say a little belief goes a long way. Fair enough. I just love this. I'm so glad. So let's do some closing-out paperwork. Okay? Oh, Ben. This is this is Ms. DeVries, but she goes by Spencer now. This is my boss, Mr. Adams. Dawn? You two know each other? Apparently, not as well as I thought we did. Wait, wait, wait. You're "Devries"? I'm lost. Well, Mr. Adams and I have been spending a lot of time together lately. Let's just say this is a huge surprise. Oh, I'm sorry, but if I knew that you were on the... Hey, hey, everyone, this is a happy moment. Dawn's paying off her debt. Did you know it was my loan? I did not. Tell her. I mean, Ben, you... you did have final say on the DeVries loan. I'm not lying. I didn't know your name was DeVries. - I thought you... - You know what? Here. This should take care of it. Please let me know when everything is finalized. Dawn, please, this is... No. Ben, I was duped by my ex for years, and I'm not gonna let that happen again. Have a nice day, Mr. Adams. Dawn, honey, did he actually lie to you? Mom, I don't wanna talk about it. Let's focus on our arrangements for the church for Easter Sunday. After all that you've told me, I don't think he deliberately misled you. Mom... It... It feels like a big misunderstanding. Please. There are some things about my break-up with Alan that still haunt me. The inability to trust someone being the biggest. Not every guy is Alan. Perhaps you're just afraid. Afraid of what? To put your heart out there again. Well, I have some pretty good reasons for that. Yes, your past really hurt you, Dawn, but you have come miles and miles since then. And now here is this young man, who, despite a misunderstanding, really seems to have a kind heart. But putting yourself back out there means risking the same thing you risked for Alan... and that scares you. Show a little faith. You like him, don't you? Yes. Very much. And you liked him very much without knowing what he did for a living. So what does that tell you? He doesn't define himself by his career, and he cares about yours. That's the exact opposite of Alan. More of a partnership? You're right, Mom. It's time for you to surrender things over. Let go, and let God do the rest. How am I supposed to do that? Forgiveness might not be a bad place to start. Whoa. Mom, you're still up? I am. Shouldn't you be sleeping? Couldn't. Dad called again. He did? That's great. Yeah, really great. We're going out for lunch next week. I'm really happy to hear that. Me too. Mom, I just want you to know... you're a really good mom. I should get to bed. I'm walking Lolly in the morning. You sure you wanna keep doing that? It's a lot of work. I'm her Uncle Justin. I can't just leave her. Ben's pretty great, too. We have this whole cool handshake we do. It keeps getting longer each time. Well, I'm very happy that you two get along so well. You know, he does always ask how you're doing. He does? Yeah. He just wants to know that everything is going well. He can tell when you're stressed. Ben seems to really care. Thank you for sharing that. All right. Now, how about you teach me a secret handshake? Nah, you just get hugs. Aww. Love you, Mom. I love you, too, Justin. This is perfect. She can set up shop in the back, fill this area here with her bracelets. You know, she doesn't know it, but I've been counting my blessings, too. - Have you? - Yeah. Just reminding myself what I'm grateful for makes me happier. Yeah. Looks like you need a little bit of cheering up. Okay. For my secret handshake with Justin. For Lolly's slobbery kisses. For this beautiful spring day. And... for your mom. - My mom? - Yeah. She's a pretty special lady. Yeah, she is. How do you feel now? Good. Lighter. Thank you. I just hope this plan works out. This place was such a good idea. You're pretty awesome, Ben. Thank you. Doesn't always feel that way, but I'll take it. Trust me, you are. I just hope she likes it. She's definitely gonna count us both as a blessing after seeing this. Actually, you know... Justin, I don't think I should be here when she arrives. You've worked so hard. You're gonna have to trust me on this. Wait, no. I've got an idea. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ This little light of mine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ This little light of mine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ Let it shine Let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine Thank you to Cassie Masters and our phenomenal choir. Thank you to our volunteers who worked hard to make this Easter service beautiful and meaningful. And now, with the promise of hope in our risen Savior, and peace and love in our hearts, let's get outside and find those Easter eggs! - I'll see you outside. - Okay. Hi, how are you? Oh, Cassie. That was so inspiring. Your music sure knows how to lift spirits on an Easter morning. Well, that's what Easter's all about. Isn't it? Celebrating renewal and hope. So beautiful. - Excuse me. - Sure. Oh, excuse me. Dawn. Thank you for your thoughtful words this morning, Pastor. I was so happy to see you back here for Sunday service. You know, these bracelets really served as a reminder to bring gratitude into our hearts. And even more, you have reminded so many people to connect with God, the giver of all good things. That is such a wonderful gift, Dawn. Thank you. Thank you! Oh, look who it is. Happy Easter, Dawn. Pearl... you have a lovely smile. Oh! Well, George said that these pearly whites were the first thing that caught his eye. Thank you, again, for giving me a reason to smile. I... I didn't think it was possible. Anything's possible with a little bit of hope. That's right. Here. Oh... It was wonderful to see you, Pearl. Lolly. What are you doing here? You sweet girl. - Hi. - Hi. Look. Dawn, I'm sorry. I should... No. No. Ben, you have nothing to apologize for. - I'm the one who... - Mom. Lolly has something for you. She does? What? Oh. What is this? What have you done? A key? What's this for? We'll show you. Can you just trust me, please? Okay. Justin, you wanna lead the way? Okay. Just follow Lolly. Okay. Just a little bit further. What... Keep 'em closed. No peeking. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. Almost there. All right. Open them. Puggy's Ice Cream Shoppe. Try it, Mom. Try it. So... this is a place for small businesses to grow. I don't understand. Welcome to Dawn's Designs. I'm gonna be a manager. And Lolly will be the co-manager. And you'll only ever have to pay me in pizza. How great is that? Wait, this is ours? Um... Okay. So... I quit my job. Obviously, it wasn't a good fit. I need to help people build their dreams. So, I purchased this place as... an incubator. So you bought this place for me? Ben, I can't possibly accept something so... Dawn, Dawn, Dawn. I didn't buy it for you. I'm... I'm renting to you. You inspired me to take a leap, and I... I wanna give back by creating an opportunity. That's it. And if you happen to need help along the way, I may know somebody with a background in finance who just happens to be quite fond of you, then I'd be more than willing to help. If that's okay. Yeah. That's more than okay. We'll be outside. Ben, I'm sorry. I let my past cloud my present with you. And you have never been anything but good to me. Well, if it helps, I forgive you. Does this mean... that we're partners? Only if that works for you. Oh, I think we can make it work. Justin. My storefront. Forgiveness. New beginnings. Oh. I'll get it. Dawn, I've got that laundry basket you asked for. It's pretty unruly laundry, so I might need some help. You did her laundry? Well, Ben says laundry basket. I say belated Easter basket. Come check it out. What you got there? It's... Mom, it's a dog! It's your dog. Dog needs a name. She doesn't have one yet. What are you gonna name her, Justin? I don't know. I can't believe she's mine. She's yours. You have shown me, and Ben, that you are more than capable of taking care of her. Your grandpa's right. Naming a dog... Big responsibility. I've got it. I'm going to call her "Hope". Why "Hope"? I mean... I hoped for a dog for a long time. I hoped for Dad to be back in my life. I hoped for a long time for you to be happy. I guess, to me, she means hope. We could all use a little more hope in our lives. I think that's perfect. "Hope". You know, it suits her. A new business. A new puppy. A new boyfriend. That's a lot of new things. And there is no one I would rather move forward with than you. One blessing at a time.
