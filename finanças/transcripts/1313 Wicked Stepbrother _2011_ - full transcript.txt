[cawing] [knocking] Hello? It's Nigel! I'm here for the party? Jarrod? I knocked on the door, but nobody answered. I just let myself in. Hope nobody minds. [under his breath] Damn it! [heart beating] Jarrod? Mrs. Mycroft? - [heartbeat continues] - Hello? I'm here for the party. Where is everybody? [heartbeat increases] First to arrive, first to dive in. [heartbeat, faster] Hey, what the hell? I was calling for you guys, and nobody answered. You're just gonna stand there and stare at me, or-- - [blade slices] - [grunts] Okay. You're 18 today. Old enough to vote. Even though there's no one worth voting for. You're old enough to join the army. But you're scared of guns. I do not feel 18. You don't look 18, either. - Shaving these days? - I told you not to burst into my room without knocking, Sebastian. - Is that a knife? - Yeah. Found it lying around in the hallway. Maybe you were playing with my collection again. I don't play with your knives. Well, maybe you should start. There. Happy birthday. What? You don't like it? No. It's wonderful. What do you want? Why does it always have to be about me, Jarrod? Maybe it's because I get my inheritance today. You and Minerva no longer have any right to my money. You make us sound so superficial. Well, I notice you two aren't exactly living in a trailer. Before Mom married your dad, we lived in plenty of trailers. No hard feelings. At least, not for me. Figure this was just a temporary gig. Especially after the old man died. - Don't talk about my dad! - He was my dad too, right? No, he wasn't. Hey, man! Today's your birthday. No one wants you walking around angry. - Right. - Of course I'm right. Now. How's about we kick things off properly? - What is that? - It's chocolate milk! What do you think? Very smooth. Never really drank alcohol. Never? Exactly how sheltered of a life did you live growing up? Never mind. Today, you're a man. Drink up! [coughs] That's awful. That's sippin' vino, my friend. Don't stop to taste it, just chug it. - Yay! - [clapping] That's how you do it. Now we're gonna have a party. [knocking at door, echoing] Hello? Hello. Hello? [door closing] Huh. Where is everybody? [heart beating] Ha! Guests get hot tubs in their rooms, too. Whoo! Now you're speaking my language! It seems Jarrod's stepmom needs a new boyfriend! Oh, yeah! Looks like I'm gonna be indisposed for the rest of the party. [sighs] [heartbeat thumping] [footsteps] Um, occupado in here! Look, silent treatment or not, I ain't getting out of this hot tub, okay? Mmm. Like a spa. You might work out. - Hey! - [slicing] How are you feeling? Sebastian? As pure as the driven snow. Did you have a talk with Jarrod? We shared a drink together. - Anything else? - I gave him the knife. Good. Make sure that he uses it. A few other guests arriving. The more, the merrier. Right? - You read my mind, Mother. - I always do. [phone beeps] [whispers] Hey, Pete. It's Marcus. I'm out at Jarrod's place. I'm in the woods. Where the hell are you? I got the map off of Rod. And I think I could figure out where Jarrod's hiding his stash. I'm gonna tie a red piece of cloth to the tree at the edge of the woods. Wait for me here at this spot, okay? I'm gonna go ahead and see if I can locate the hiding place. Don't screw this up, man. I'm not trying to spend a night in jail. [heart beating] [footsteps] [heartbeat, footsteps] Hello? [heart beating] Hello? Hello? Hello? [echoing] Hello? Hello? [door closes] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? [hinge creaks] [heart beating] [heart beating] - [knife slicing] - [squelching] [sighs] This is just like the commercials, man. "Refreshing." Gets me every time. [heartbeat] [glasses clinking] [heartbeat] [heartbeat] [door squeaks] [heartbeat] [heartbeat] - [beeping] - Wow! Dead battery? Terrific! Mark's gonna be P.O.'d. [heartbeat] You know what? Probably shouldn't have the whole shebang. I'm gonna go back to the pool and get a drink. [gasps, grunts] [knocks] Hello? It's Frank and Kelly! - The party can begin! - Where's the butler? - Where's Jarrod? - [chuckles] Where's Waldo? - Could be self-service. - So, what do you mean? Like, we let ourselves in? It means I came here to float around in somebody's pool. And that's what I plan on doing. Isn't that called "breaking and entering"? I'm not gonna break anything. - See? Door was open. - I think we should wait. Wait for what? Sundown? Relax, okay? We were invited here. Besides, if we get caught, I'm tellin' 'em it was your idea. Then I'm going around back. [taps glass] Frank and Kelly just showed up. Don't you want to party with your pals? They're not my pals. I barely even know them. See, that's your whole problem. You'd rather sit in here in the house, while all the fun's happening outside. Tell me you're not going to be one of those videogame-playing nerds, hiding out in your basement all the time. Especially with your kind of money. [sighs] Can't you all just leave me alone? You left this upstairs. What the hell would I want to carry this around for? Huh? Because it's your birthday present. Oh-ho! You want a drink now, do you? Hey-- Take it easy with that stuff. You're still a beginner. Hey, I said, take it easy. Why are you being nice to me all of a sudden? I don't know. Maybe I'm making up for lost time. I remember when you wouldn't even talk to me. I grew up. So did you. I wish you two hadn't insisted on this stupid birthday party. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. You know, even if people do show up, they were just here to hang out at somebody's pool. Or they ask me to buy them stuff. Nobody's here for me. They're all leeches. - You know what you do to leeches? - No, what? You cut them off. [soft chuckle] - Very funny. - I'm serious! Rich kids like you get away with murder every day. You've got enough money that you can practically buy your way out of anything. Meanwhile, back in the real world? I'm not murdering anybody, okay? That's crazy. What's crazy is that you've been the low man on the totem pole your entire life. The low man with the biggest wallet. Those guys laugh at you when you're not around. What if I invited them here so that you can be the big guy for once? What if they're here so that you can do society a favor... and get rid of them? - You're sick. - You've thought about it. Hell, you probably even posed in front of the mirror with that knife when I gave it to you. Am I right? - [door opens] - Where are you going? I'm gonna go out to the pool. Hang out with the guys or something. Sure that's a good idea? Especially with that knife in your hand? There's your present back. I don't want it. Where is everybody? We're the first ones here. At least there's actually supposed to be a pool party. - Yeah, but-- - Yeah, but nothing. Look, there's a pool. There's a spread. I'm sure there's a cooler and a boombox around here somewhere. Let's enjoy it. Remember: D.O.I. I know. Don't overthink it. Don't overthink it. ** [electronica] See all the gang? This is weird. - We're like what? - We're like we're at a rich kid's pool party, and there's nobody here. This place should be packed by now. Jarrod isn't all that popular. In fact, most of his friends are currently standing around his pool. Ah, it doesn't matter: big pool, free food? Somebody's bound to sneak in some beer, and by then you tend to overlook the unpopular thing. I don't care, man. I ain't looking a gift pool in the mouth. You want to go? Go. You not seriously about to lay down to tan, are you? - Will you get my back? - What? Come on. I can't reach. You get my back, I'll get yours. No! Mine doesn't need it. I'm gonna go in there. I'm gonna find Jarrod, and I'm gonna find a shower. Well, before you go, rub some lotion on my back. You are such a little kid sometimes, Frank. Less talking. More rubbing. You owe me. Sure. Whatever. I'm gonna go inside and find Jarrod, and then I'm gonna take a shower. Mm-hmm. And then I'm gonna light myself on fire. - Mm-hmm. - You're totally lame. - Have fun. - You bet! Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? Oh. Hi, Mrs. Mycroft, you startled me. Please. Call me Minerva. Uh, Minerva. Good to see you again, Kelly. Jarrod's friends don't come around too often. Let's see. Last time I saw you... Uh... I was 14. Mmm. You're not 14 anymore, that's for sure. [chuckles] No, ma'am. Am I making you nervous, Kelly? No, I, uh... - No, no. I'm not nervous. - Well, that's good. 'Cause I want you to have fun today. Well, where is everybody? I thought this place would be packed by now. Oh, it's early yet. Our guests should be arriving shortly. Well, I actually had a few things I wanted to ask you. - Fire away. - Well, to start, where's Jarrod? Um, he's around. He's spending time with his stepbrother. Oh, I didn't even know he had a stepbrother. They don't get along. And Jarrod hates to acknowledge him. However, I think they're going to be bonding... quite a bit today. Well, that's good, isn't it? You have no idea. - Any more questions? - Well, yeah, actually. I was gonna see if I could take a shower. Me and Frank came in and we took a dip in the pool, and I was wondering if I could wash off all the chlorine. Mm. Second door on the left. You'll find plenty of clean towels in the closet. - All right, thanks! - Mm-hmm. Oh, and you definitely don't look like you've ever had a child. You just made my week. [heartbeat, footsteps] You back so soon? Ah, silent treatment. Whatever, dude. Hey, you mind grabbing me a beer? Dying of thirst. - [gasps] - [knife slices] ** [electronica] [voice, close by] Kelly? Jarrod? Who the hell called my name? Jarrod? Jarrod? - [door slamming] - Hey! This isn't funny! [doorknob rattles] Hey, somebody let me out of here! - [blade zings] - [Kelly grunts] [blood gushing] Glad you could make it, Kelly. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? [sighs] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Where are you guys? Hello? Hello? Hello? [heartbeat] [heartbeat continues] [blade slices] - [groans] - [blood sloshes] Frank? Kelly? Anybody? I think your friends went home. Yeah? I think your birthday party idea was a bust. [laughs] They weren't my friends. I don't have any friends. Well, I don't know why. - I'm not Sebastian. - Mm. You're more alike than you realize. Go gloat somewhere else, Minerva. Believe me, I'm not gloating! You know, I don't even see why you and Sebastian are still here. I'm taking enough out of my account... to pay for college, putting the rest in a savings-- I'm not even keeping this house. I'm here because you needed a legal guardian when your father died-- I don't expect you to be grateful. Well, as of today, I don't need a legal guardian anymore. What do you need, Jarrod? What are you doing? You know, I used to catch you out of the corner of my eye... when I'd be undressing at night, watching me. - I never-- - Oh, yes you did. When I'd ever-so-quietly open your door, when you turned out the lights? And I'd sneak a little peek of my own. You didn't mind, did you? No. I'm glad you got so much pleasure looking at my body. Because, now that you're 18, maybe we could stop window-shopping. ** [electronica] What's wrong with you two? Go talk to him. No problem. Think he's ready for our final plan. I know. Go! Hey, man. Happy birthday! Go home, Mike. Party's canceled. - Canceled? - Yeah, we're having this... family crisis thing right now. Come on, you only get to turn 18 once. Don't let your stepmom bring you down. Wow, man. I knew you had some pretty swanky digs, - but this place is nice! - Seriously, Mike. - You have to go. - See, Jarrod, this is why you don't have any friends. You need to learn to take care of the ones you still have. We're not friends. In fact, I don't even know how you got an invitation. - I invited him. - Fine! Then you throw him out, because I don't want this party in my house. No way, man. This is your last birthday present. Remember our little talk earlier? This is what I'm talking about. This leech! And you... - get to cut him off! - What are you talking about? Run. What happened to Frank and Kelly? Same thing that happened to Nigel, when he showed up. Same thing that we're about to do to Mike. - I'm calling the cops. - Trust me, birthday boy. You don't want to call the cops. [Jarrod] Mike! You like? - You did this? - No, man. We did this. What are you talking about? Finish it. Kill Mike and end this party on a high note. - Kill Mike. - Dude, please! Please, don't. As usual, I have to hold your hand. Congratulations, Jarrod. You're officially a killer. What are you talking about? Sebastian did this. Sorry, honey. There is no Sebastian. There's just me, and your prints all over the murder weapon. I just called the police. Terrified! You see, you were diagnosed with multiple personalities... when you were about 12. Remember all those vitamins your father made you take? Those were meds. After he died, I sort of let the prescription lapse. That's about the time you started talking to your... quote, unquote stepbrother. He was everything you wanted to be. Everything you couldn't be. No. I couldn't convince you to kill anyone. But Sebastian became the perfect wicked stepbrother. Now you're going to spend the rest of your life in a mental hospital, and I'm executor of the estate. Too bad you didn't love me like he did, because we could have split your father's inheritance, and had ourselves quite a time. - Sebastian? - I guess this is good-bye, bro. I'm not going to let you keep me in that hospital. [Minerva laughing] [laughing continues]
