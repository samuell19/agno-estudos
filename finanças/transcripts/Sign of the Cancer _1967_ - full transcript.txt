...The usage of cleanings has increased lately. Our nurses seem to make reserves for their homes. From 1st to 14th july the ground floor will be being painted. The 2 weeks after the 1st floor. MONDAY -In august the 2nd floor. You will all get also a thorough schedule. Be only kind enough to plan the closing of all departments in time. I don't know yet how to organise the cleaning. The directory hasn't anybody to help again. I was informed, that all windows must be lacquered and in September, during the whole traffic. -It's all so far. -Who's next? -A conference starts in 2 days... -Tomorrow actually Lord Marlow is to come by plane this afternoon We managed to get a room for him in Hotel Alcron When the committee kind of disapointed us. And the professor Steinhoser is to come tomorow... by his own car, from Munchen And comrade Lysenko, When is he coming? Grisenko is also coming? I will start conference by brief welcoming. I will replace on this Mr. professor.. Dr. Hahn speaking after me will have the main speech. Let's do a rehearsal, are you ready? for about 10 years... The decorating of clinic goes on well -Thank you. How's your father doing? I'm always warned about Heart attack but what could be worse than you? Well, it threatens even us I don't underestimate it -I'm glad to see, you are doing well -I'm doing even great -Take this. -You do know, we're all superstitious. Aren't you superstitious only when working is needed? -Mrs. doctor is a terrific worker. -Glad to hear that. You are free now. So you don't regret to be only at this ordinary hospital? Not at all. I hate favouritism, you know? They should have informed us that they'd stay for lunch. Could have some snack ourselves. I especially look forward the funny English of Mr. lecturer. But he's making his way to the world even with it. Hope you had a good time last night. -How was your sleeping? -Bad. Your cure made me suffer so hard! You were snoring like hell! I couldn't sleep at all. Give him some cure for snoring! The patient will be home before this week's end. -But I really don't feel good. -All test were negative. You'll get a cure for home use. This place isn't good for you. Mr. Fabian is here because of gallbladder colic. The last seizure was his own fault. ...I can find there nothing by touch. ... and the urine was also quite negative... The gallbladder should be putout. Mr. doctor. What? Let me out. My bro is getting married. My child is ill. You would get much worse. - Mr. assistant, I have it ready for you. - Later. Hallo there, How are you, gentlemen? Well, we are good, but what about you? Josef Zima, 50 years. Sclerosis dementia. - After heart attack. - What's he saying? That you're a great chap. Mrs. teacher has a better hemogram now. The beautiful lioness awaits you. I heard she cuckolded me with Divish. She saw him and... Beware Prokopa. She begins to be suspicious. Watches over every word. No wonder. I also wouldn't want to kick the bucket. Better not to think about it. Are you rushing home, Mrs. Lysa? -No, Yes, I don't know. We try the new cure on this case. It reduces the pain but we can't improve the ability to move. - How about your knuckles? - Always the same. Yesterday, We have again that semolina pudding for lunch again. -How do you feel, Mrs. Zemkova? - How should I put it? Kind of better and kind of not better. Depends on how you look at it...Mr. lecturer. Breath. Where have you been when needed for sedimentation? - I haven't been needed. - You have. She was on toilet the whole time. Today toilet, yesterday you had eaten. You are acting like a child. Lay down. -What's actually wrong with me? -Infection. But you don't belive it. You people belive nothing nowadays. Because you have denied god. You'd have more peace and patience otherwise. - I'm too old for you, am I not? - What are you talking about? - About your Jirzina. - Stop it! What are you doing? - Tell me the truth. - Well, as you wish. I may be doing wrong but your suspicion is correct. - You want to marry her? - I don't know but it doesn't matter. Right, it no longer matters. I will stop spoiling your life. - Are you on duty today? -yes. - Well...nothing. I'll be in lab from 6:00 Mr. doctor, here it is. I will explain everything for you. - Let's go some place when... - But I'm on duty today. I see, but you should know that the mars is just entering the sign of the cancer. - Has it some importance for me? - Your sign is the cancer, isn't it? - So what? - Mars means evil - Thank you. INSPECTION ROOM Cigarettes, please. Jesus, isn't this blood? Do you work with this kind of gloves there? - Take this, I have the whole dozen. - I'm in hurry. Please, return to your rooms in a disciplined way. Call quickly for surgeon. Watch out, damn! It would need some stitches. That's how I found them. You have done it! Where are they so long? - Where is it? - 4th floor, not so loud. - Where are you heading? - to surgery, to see if everything is ready. A doctor's bad luck. I knew a guy who had managed to ride a bike all the way home.. from a pub with a similar injury. Must have been shock what have doomed Josef. I was so close. If I had peeped into... Unfortunately, you hadn't. The death may have come during ventricular fibrillation. I need no consoling. - Which time has it happen? - Around 7:00. - And no one saw him from 4:30? He had just gone to the inception room. I found him...them some time after 7:00 Some one may have come to see him there. Seems, we're gonna be stucked here till morning. They're questioning the old man for more than hour and he even wasn't here. No wonder. Most of us doesn't have a proper alibi. I for instance was up studying. Most of us woun't need an alibi for sure. You belive, it was some one from us? I guess so. It seems, he was just writing something. There was a pen on the floor and ink on his fingers. Maybe the pen ceased to write... he reached out for another one... blocking out his view... The killer seized a pair of scissors... and that's it. They will also take fingerprints, won't they? Shouldn't we turn the light on? How will it help? I must out. I need a peace and this is what happens here. The killer may still be here. Or he may come back later. That's what killers do. There should be a watch at the door. - Call for the nurse. - Call yourself! Good evening, mr. professor. Dr. Hahn was very intelligent. We get on well together... both personally and professionally Therefor it was me... who recommanded his habilitation. You can check that. But he wasn't a lecturer so far... He was to vindicate his work of habilitation next month. So there would be 2 of you lecturers, right? Actually 3, colleague Martinec is in France at the moment. You two had some professional disputes before, right? Yes, we had a fundamental contradiction. It was back in 50's. ...I was wrong. As well as some others. His opinions proved to be more correct. Against him, there had been some arrangements then in 50's, which I didn't a bit participate in. Dr. Hahn was to have the main speech on the conference? Yes, for his work had woke a great interest abroad. I was glad for him. - And your works, comrade lecturer? That's another branch. Cardiology. But I belive, they also sort of matters. So it's another branch. You had a professional dispute still. Genetics has connections with all the medical branches. That's why it can't be separated from the Cardiology. He must have had an uneasy private life... I'm not sure about these things, But I don't think so. He had only one serious relation. With Marie; Dr. Novakova. It was very decent relation. And what about Jirzina Kotova? She wanted doctor, as it happens - But he didn't take it so seriously. - And did she? As for me, I was never interested in these things. He was my best friend. Competent, diligent, ambitious man. He was very smart, even too much. ...Actually not that much. So much or not that much? I used to think much. But now I guess not that much. - Why? - Because he lost everything in the end. Closely but lost still. What about nurse Jirzina Kotova? Jirzina?...Nonsense. She has so much suitors... Now, she's mourning but she will recall nothing in a few weeks. How long did you know about the relation? - Since the beginning. He never tried to hide it. We didn't found it important. - Did it happen often? - Not really. Did you also have affaires? I was rather mature when we met. You hold rather modern opinions, don't you? So was it a shallow relation which you approve of? It wasn't really shallow. Looked like very tender relation. It provided Josef thinks that I could no longer give him. It brought no change between us. - Could have she forced him to marry her? - Nonsense So you don't think, she's the murderer? - I don't. She had absolutely no reason. I don't know, why she have accused me. Maybe out of hysteria. - There's your chair in the corridor. - It is. - Do you sit there often. - All the time. Were you there this afternoon? Yes. The whole afternoon? Didn't you go away even for a while? For a while maybe. And when, Mr. Zima? - About two times - when? - You know, what happened today? - Something happened? - So you don't know? - Did you know Dr. Hahn? The murdered one? I did, how couldn't I? We all knew him, didn't we? - And do you know, who did it? - No way. No one knows so far. There's a lot of coppers around. But they have uncovered nothing yet. You was watching the door all the time, Mr. Zima. Recall. Who went in. Nobody went. Someone must have. Dr. Hahn for instance. He was murdered there, right? So he went there. And you saw him going there? I didn't But you must have. Lot of people went there. Also Jirzina. The nice nurse. Don't you know her? And then Bozhena, Dr. divish... Me. You did saw me, didn't you? No no! She didn't go there. That I saw well. She didn't go there. No one did! That Zima wasn't in his room the whole afternoon. Maybe he had thought, the doctor cured him badly. Come on gentlemen, you can't suspect without proof. And you belive, they will find some proves? If not them, I will try. - Your stars will tell you? - Of course. How about going to bed, Mr. Heyna? May I ask something? A delicate thing. - The constipation again? - No, it's all right now. I would need dates of birth of everyone from here. - Nurses, all the personal, and so on. - Hm. TUESDAY You know, If I really murdered I would rather choose you. You obstructed. He pitied you and nearly left me. I've never pitied you. His publicly cuckolding you made me feel happy. Now I hate him for leaving me here with this sucker. Please, leave me alone. Don't act like, you're not concerned. I would have marred him in the end. Though he slept with Hoshkova before the last night. I knew, and couldn't care less. She ceased to attract even Petera and how keen on her he used to be. It all no longer matters. to hell with it. Mrs. Assistant What a terrible news. Everything may happen nowadays. - Frank condolences, Mrs. assistant. - Thank you. I wanted to see you yesterday. But there was no opportunity. Don't be upset. It no longer concerns you. I will go with you What could I tell you now? We denied the chance for solace... in the name of the reason. Our wretched reason should be enough for our wretched death. A wretched thing to say but it's all we have. - Maybe it's not so little. - Thank you, Mr. professor. You know, in my age... I must think very factually of those things. - And it's not a pleasant thing. - Mr. chief! Some one has cut off a piece. Maybe the fellas from x-ray section. Let's go. Mrs. Assistant! I must tell you! Mrs. Lysa, you do know that so much sweets is bad for you. I will tell Mr. lecturer. Will we have the bowl now ...or later? Put away that wadding. And break off the frizura, ladys. Must there be a mess like this? What's wrong, Prokopa? Would you like me to arrange your hairdo? If Mr. professor could at least tell me what awaits me? Nurse, will we have the bowl? ...Or even later? - His first ward round in years. - Doesn't know a single patient. Look how many of us today! Mr. professor Who is it? A wife of the one with leukemia who is in agony already. Did you tell her? She doesn't belive. Still bringing him food. How do you do. I say Marie, I heard, the codger is involved. The old Zima? He was there but doesn't remember a thing. Maybe he don't even remember what he did... What do you mean? His paroxysms are just out of control. Absolute dementia. He wouldn't even be responsible. In a juridical way. - Why should he? - This case doesn't need any reasons. Old Zima? I don't think so. You will see. When will they come to ask again? - Who? - the coppers. No doubt, they will come. Good Morning. How I hate this condolences. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. M. Rzezatch has a problem with mitral valve and- He's been repeatedly here because of decompensation Now Mr. Kozaak who has staphylococcus sepses with andreal gland exhausce He's getting oleandomycin and cortisol, 50 mg per day. But isn't it too much? Especially when dealing with parallel infection. This amount is quiet usual nowadays. And Mr. Zima with generalized Atherosclerosis... Now after myocardial infarction. Cardio sclerosis offset for the moment. It's OK. Thank you. It'll be all right. This patient is here repeatedly because of digestion problems. Examinated with negative results. Who will read Hahn's speech on conference? Will you? Not me. But you are the head of the clinic. I was 10 years ago ass well. We will need some younger one for it. If so, the youngest one. Hoshkova. - She'll be just the right one. - Ok Good Morning. Hm, an ambitious nurse with a pretty face. We are too much solidaristic. What's wrong with her? She was Hahn's last sweetheart. You had to cover them for sure. Hadn't you an alibi, She'd be glad to drag you into it. - Helena? - what? - Wasn't you looking for me? - No? When? Last night. I was told by my patients. It's not possible. I was out before 6:00. Oh, I know. I visited my dad. And may have wanted to ask what you think... - It's always the same. You know it. - Hm, So long. Thanks - Hi - Hi - Why didn't you join us? - All that skirts? I'd need you to hold in Hoshkova, at least for half an hour. Should I x-rey her or what? Sorry. Stop bullshiting. Hear what a tobacconist told me this morning. He saw Hoshkova with blood stained gloves yesterday. 7:00 pm, see? What am I to chatter with her about? You will know. I musn't fall asleep. - Will they come today? - Not today. No worry and sleep. You know nothing anyway. I know everything. I'm a witness. I only can't...well...recall. But I will someday. Have a good rest now. Maybe you will recall after. Mr. Zima, Mr. Zima. Be kind and recall. Which time was it? Morning? Noon? Evening? And which hour? Didn't they tell you? Every one is told when he was born. Nurse Eva? Where is nurse Jirzina staying? First floor. Room 23. - Thank you. Why didn't they knock her out when they caught her there? They must arrest her soon. - Do you think she was jealous of Mrs. doctor? - of course, my dear. What's so special about her? Have you ever seen her with a cigarette in the trap? And I guess Dr. Divish is a fagot. I know these intellectuals. But Petera is pretty handsome though poor Hahn was better. Mr. lecturer is also a hunk, especially when shaved. Say, what was that with this Hoshkova? Did you sleep with her? One don't talk about these things. Yes or not? You must have a good reason for this questioning. I have. I belived for a while... to love her. I was wrong. It lasted about a month. We hadn't sex. - Where's a corkscrew? - In a drawer down there. Why did you ask? Well, it was silly. I tried to find the blood stained gloves. Of course, there was only another ones, clean. I've found nothing there. - How am I concerned? - She was also your sweetheart. So you think I have done it? Out of jealousy? Some one has murdered him. But belive, it wasn't me. Do you think, Hoshkova could have done it? A minute. I'm Vlchek, do you remember? Husband of Prokopa Vlchek, right? I wanted to give some stuff for my wife to the doorman... And he...He'd send me away. I'll give it to her. She'll be glad. Hm, glad... She didn't even speak to me yesterday. Mrs. doctor... you can't let her suffer like this for ever... Unfortunately there's no more more we can do, as I told you. Well, I'm no expert. But I knew a girl with a cancer, who was cured. It is sometimes possible but the case of your wife... - If she at least didn't know. - She doesn't. She's afraid of a cancer because it killed her parents. Everyone's afraid of it these days. But she doesn't know. Do at least something with her awful fear, if nothing else. We keep telling her it's a chronic infection. How long will she belive? Am I to told her that she's coming to heaven, or what? I'm sorry. I know, you're doing your best. Why has the doorman send him here? I can do nothing for him anyway. Can I sleep here? - You can - Good. I did not really like that Hoshkova. My only love ever was the medicine. And even that has turned bad, as you see. What...? Who is it? Turn the light on. The light! Come on! Stop! This door. Open, please. - Or we'll knock out the door! - You can't escape by window. - He's there. - Silence! I can't... Jesus, I won't make it. It was wrong door. I've dropped in home to see if my husband hasn't a girlie there. He know well, I'm just stucked here. Has he cheated you so often? Only once would be enough for me... to kill him, the children ...and myself. WEDNESDAY - We need a replacement for Dr. Hahn. I can temporarily release my colleague Divish. We will need some one permanent. Petera. How's your father doing? Mrs. doctor. Yes, Mr. professor. She'll be the one after all for her father is needed here. - 'morning - 'morning - Who's this? - Korytek. The husband of the one who kept bring him the food. Look. It stinks already. Don't you have some better cigarette, Mr. doctor? I have never been unjust to Dr. Petera. I'm only notifying you. I have no personal interest. Dr. Petera has the right to hope to get... the assistant post this time at last. He should have long ago. I've always appreciated his work. So you don't disagree with his getting it now? It's not only me to make the decision. It's no my fault that he doesn't have it yet. I can't even knock out a drunk orderly. And as I said, I'm not a bit unjust to Dr. Petera. After all, my opinion wouldn't make any difference. So you woun't support his request? Probably not. May I ask why not? I would like you to understand properly. We need young experts. and I think, Dr. Petera... is sort of...older. All right. I understand. So long, Mr. professor. Some news, Mariana? No longer. You should see me first when you have some problems. Mrs. Loulova I will be questioned again. Get ready copies of current expenses files... for year '64 and '65 so far. Thank you. Now, he thinks we are doing some scheming here. What's wrong? I must have tell them. Mr. professor will be very angry. What? Mr. Professor had lied. He was on the clinic during the murder. Even the doorman knows. Hoshek is having a heart attack. Lay still, don't talk. - Call Mr. Professor... - It'll be all right. Call Mr. Professor. They say, he's been arrested. Mr. Lecturer! Mr. professor's wife is looking for you everywhere. Where is she? An unpleasant thing, lady. Where is my husband really? He's being questioned. I can bring you to him. I will go myself. It's embarrassing but would you know... where he was during that...mess? How indecent to ask. But I'm used already. I woun't go mad so easily. I only wonder my husband didn't because of your helping him. Hope he will grow wiser at last and let himself be retired. And you will find another one to cover some people... incapable of ruling. We're no longer interested. And we don't have children, thank god. So you've got rid of Dr. Hahn finally, right? No doubt now. The professor is the offender. So it goes. The higher position the bigger rascal. - God, I can't belive. - And you right, of course. During the murder he was at the dean's. Who's said those lies? He should be punished. Just stop to think about it. Only an embarrassing episode. Why are you not curing me? I'm here so long and you do nothing. Listen, Prokopa. You need to be patient. We did all examinations possible. Now, we will do x-ray and you'll see there will be a great improvement. Well, it's a chronic infection. DO NOT ENTER Turn by left hip to me. Turn back. Take a breath again. - Marie - Yes? - How's it come out? - Wait a minute. Turn by left hip. Yes. Ok. Take a deep breath. Well, it's not that bad. The right side is improving. You can exhale. The left hip once more. Take a breath. Hold breath. Ok. - It'll be all right. - What did the old man say? That it's out of question. He's scared. Dress up, Prokopa. So the codger is afraid of comrade lecturer. Who has already averted Dr. Hahn...and me as well. But Josef didn't budge so easily. He was close to be known worldwide. And it was annoying for some one. So he had to disappear again...and for sure. Do you really belive that a doctor would use scissors? Well, using a poison would make him the most suspect one. Not so with scissors ...as he must have known well. Hm, I don't think so. This was my last chance. Now, I'll be moved away to clinic... And that ninny would sit there because of her father's influence. Her father has an Angina Pectoris again, you know? Well, If Hoshek wasn't here some other big shot would... And I would be fucked up anyway. Well, there are only 3 possibilities: Zima Josef - a patient from our section. Prokopa Vlchkova - the young melancholic one. - from female section. - and the 3rd one? This is sad but I can't be tactful in such a case We are dealing with a murder. Dr. Marie Novakova. Every others are absolutely out of question. How have you come to it? It's quite simple. I've found out that only these ones had this year, 1st June, 6:00 - the time of the murder a very negative acceptance towards Dr. Hahn who was born at sign of the cancer with the ascendant of the Scorpio and given that he was under influence of mars then... and as you see, mars means evil in this case. Oh. Well... I will try to collect another proves. It will be easy now. I haven't killed him, really. It was his blood on the gloves but... When I came there he was alone...and death. Nothing more could be done. Then I burned the gloves. You will be revealed sooner or later anyway. I had wanted to go home but knew he was there alone... - Pardon me if you can. It's OK. - What will you do now? - I don't know. I think, I did wrong to study medicine. I should have rather studied languages. Arabian or something like that, see? But no, You'll get the Hahn's post now. Woun't there be an audition? It will, of course. But you'll get the post just the same. Instead of Petera who is, sorry, more competent - Do you know who hated the deceased by far the most? - I don't. Divish. Josef told him once, he was a half-idiot subsidized by the state. He's confessed. You know who? The old Zima. You don't say. Confessed to what? He was investigated before. He had killed his wife...Ouch! Lay still. His wife died of tuberculosis 20 years ago. That's what he had told you. But today he's saying different. Maybe he's lost nerve. They all do after all. - So he confessed to kill his wife? - Of course. Indirectly. He kept repeated: I was investigated...see? How do you feel, Mr. Zima? Here we go, little girl. Be good and sleep. All right, let's sleep. Is there place enough for you? - It is. - Was it yucky? Was it too yucky for you? No, it was delicious. You're too little so far. Would you like me to tell you a fairy tale? No, we will sleep. - But I want to tell a tale. - Ok, tell then. one...two...three This schizophrenic thought that the valerianae tincture... an assistant of a Brno clinic had prescribed to him... had caused his impotence. He wanted to be informed who is responsible for that damage. They told him that the chief of clinic is. He had wanted to shoot the assistant before. But being informed like this he shot professor Prochazka... who didn't know a thing, poor chap... - and maybe was impotent himself. - But it was nonsense. He should have found out first if That Tincture could have caused that. - But he didn't ask. That is the point. - How comes? - He was a schizophrenic. - So what? - If he had asked... - But he hadn't. That's it. So you think that some uncovered schizophrenic here... Well, I was told that at Karlovy Vary... a doctor was having a walk with his wife and... out of blue a guy jumped off a bushes, shot him and disappeared. It was a bad case of tuberculosis. Some one had told him that murdered one cured him badly. They never should have told him that. Of course they should not. So you suspect somebody in particular. Not really. But some could have this motiv. Motive?...The only motive used to be... - well, the money. But it's no longer possible now. - What? What? Well, to kill because of money. I could name at least 15 cases like that. From a murdered taxi driver to a grandmother who... was killed by a grandchild because of money for a cinema. You can't call money 5 bucks. - So what should I call it? - Cut it out. - You know well what i meant. - I don't. Tell me. You're trying to make me an asshole. You can't stand I'm higher than you... Well, it is too bad but not your fault. I apologize. - I often drive myself mad too. - Bullshit, no one do. Ok, if you say so. I know, you suspect me. Don't pretend not to. I...I.. I was... I was there. Looking for stethoscope. He was dead already. Wait a minute..When? Where was it? Well...the inspection room. Before he was found. - I swear, he was dead already. - Calm down, man. I've never suspected you. - Neither has Marie. - I feel so sick. A handkerchief was there also. blood-stained, and never found after. - Take it easy. We belive you. - Where are you going? - To ambulance. Not to police. - Please, tell nobody. No worry. - Why Petera dislikes me? - And you like him? I...I dislikes him for he dislikes me. So it's simple at least. Do you realize, the only one who could profit from the dead is Petera? Yes...He would end up like an average doctor otherwise. The one who keeps telling me that I am only average. That's not his business. I like being average. Most of us are. Therefor the opinion of averages is the most important, isn't it? It'll never stop bleeding if you don't quit this bullshit. Go away. Pulmonary embolism Could he be poisoned? He was the last one to see... - the real murderer. - I don't think so But autopsy will tell for sure. - Nurse -Yes. - Cover his vomit. What now? Hynek is playing cards at lodge and said he comes after. - If he feels like - I'm going. - I can't stand him. What's up? - Zima must be prepared for autopsy in 2 hours. - Don't go. - Juridical autopsy is settled already. - Guys, there's no point- Be kind enough to see to that transport. And it's fucked up now. - Asshole. - Only this Kus is left. -Lady, are you here for- -Don't be fool. What's wrong? She's got cool tits. Good bye? Have you guys murdered another one? There's no longer a proper man here. You are all commanded like dogs. We used to chop down whole woods like young bushes. And women also. It's a pity, you chop down no longer. Well, you're no young bush. Will you see to that transport? That darling of yours was lucky to be killed just in time. And this is a slayer as well You have a beautiful section. It was natural death this time. The autopsy is an usual arrangement. ...in the middle of the night? Am I to belive this? All right, we are not so sure. You're a pretty liar. And I don't like this. I know who killed that doc, you know? I woun't crash into each bullshit you make out. She's not home. No one's answering. Marie, open for the god's sake? I've taken some sleeping pills. Hynek had made me so upset. - Zima has disappeared. - Are you mad? Don't you know, he's died? You were all by it. There is the autopsy. Hasha must have driven him there. Attendant Hasha is missing. His belongings aren't in his flat. How did he act as you saw him the last time? Wait a minute. I knew it had been murder. We should have call police before. Zima was the main witness. The killer must have been scared to death that he will recall after all. Did you ask the driver? He knows nothing. Hasha told him nothing. We should have known that Hasha is involved. We will look for him and the body everywhere. But I don't think we will find Hasha here for he said his good bye. And in what a way. MURDERERS - What's up? - What are you doing here? - Why? - It's 3:00 AM. I have no time to scholastic work at day. Have you been here the whole night? - Why are you asking? - Are you alone here? Do you feel like...? THURSDAY - Good morning, Mr. professor Good morning. - Do you go to country these days? - Mr. lecturer was here to see you. He will come again. - I need to talk to you. - About what? You have some problems? What do you wish? I would like to quit. I belived that... people working together as long as the two of us... need no explanations. Well... Probably, you didn't come to terms with my having lied... Right? I think, Mr. lecturer wouldn't be so surprised. Better make me some coffee. I lied many times, Mrs. Loulova. It pleases me, that you are surprised. The times... The times I used to hesitate to lie a little... Where are the times.... I used to hesitate to lie a little. Oh, you've come to listen. Mr. lecturer has denied the last scruples. Ok, let's behave like animals. So listen, I will tell you everything I should have a long time ago. Your coffee, Mr. professor. 'twas Hasha's last joke before disappearing. But this is exception. We are all afraid of death. It's natural. Professor must be really mad about it. B7 The fear of death is less intense in higher age or by the seriously ill. But there are also the other extreme. The fear is some times pathological. It sort of relates with hypochondria. In these cases you must be careful not to let them know... by your words or gestures, the seriousness or even worsening ...of their state. To physical problems caused by the disease could then the psychical ones add. What do you have? Show me. I've found it here. That I procured to Dr. Hahn for those Englishmen. Where was I? Psychical problems could add which are... - for some one even more oppressive. - Mrs. assistant. But there was blood on it. Only the two of you are left. There's no use of denying. Let's speak the truth. If you are guilty, - I will uncover it anyway. - Enough, Mr. Heyna. It's time for changing. if doctor catch you by it you will go home to prophesy. I promise, if my dad made it I would do without that post. I wouldn't take it even if they forced me. I'm afraid, there's no hope. You can't beat the fate. There must be some hope, please. What...? Could I talk to you, please? Go ahead. guess, who you owe this all. I woun't let no one to jump with joy behind my back. It's tough with our old man. When some really clean one suddenly besmirch himself... He no longer knows what he's doing. I'm accustomed to fight whatever it takes. Look. DR. PETERA ASSESSMENT ...THEREFOR PETERA ISN'T CONVENIENT TO BE A GENERAL PRACTITIONER Interesting, isn't it? THEREFOR PETERA ISN'T CONVINIENT TO BE A GENRAL PRACTITIONER The signature of our professor. Hm...what you're gonna do about this? Nothing, no one takes this seriously now. Our old man's learned nothing. So has no influence. And have you? I've learned a lot of things. I'm actually an unhappy man. You can do whatever you like with people, whatever tell them, whatever prescribe them, whatever forbid them... and in the end you must despise them extremely. I must be too healthy so I've chosen you. For I think you are very skillful. And I need a few decent men to revive this hovel. Where every one belives to be there because of his merit. Let's be internationally famous clinic again. Will you join me? Of course. Thank you. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. No doubt we will put this in order. See you at Hahn's funeral. - Only guys die here, see that? - Hopefully 3 will be enough. Ladys I have some news. I've found corpus deliciti. I will know the murderer in a few hours. It must have dropped out from Dr. Hahn's pocket. Unfortunately, it proves nothing. Have you a cigarette, please? - Looking for some one, Mr Zemkova? - Dr. Petera's invited me. The 4th door, then. Beside the my one. - With no sign on it. - Thanks. Just great. They've seen you at my very door... Terrific. Just great. - Have a drink. - I'm sorry. Comes from my new friend. Mr. lecturer. The bastard. Well, I have no one to be friend with. No one understands me. Listen... Aren't you hot here? Why? - What about take off a little? - I don't know... - Let's do it. - I don't think I should. Not so loud. They're next door. Good evening, I bring some Hahn's things. Dr. Novakova Speaking, comrade captain. I'm allowed to call any time. I want to change my testimony. Maybe I'm too rush. But I'm not sure that I will be alive till the morning. I lied before...yes. We had broke up with Dr. Hahn 2 hours before the murder. It was Him who had left me. He had left me because of Jirzina. It was all useless. I gave him back free like they say. He accepted. I acted like it was all right. But I wanted to kill him for a while. But I didn't. Neither did jirzina. She had no reason. He was hers already. I also belived for a while that she had done it. That he may have told her he wanted to come back to me. So she out of jealousy... But no, he didn't want to. He wanted to marry her. I am too old. You also can't fall asleep? Let's go to inspection room. We will make coffee. - I like you so much. - I like you too...come. There's no reason to be so worried, Prokopa. Sit down. See...So long medical history. And you've been here only 10 days. After the examinations we know how to cure you. It will take some time. You need to be patient. - If only I could trust you. - Why shouldn't you? I try to trust you...but... I can't keep it for long. That feeling comes again. Don't belive feelings. The sense is more important. But I can take nothing by sense. You decide about me in a foreign language. I will explain. Look, the 1st X-ray... looked kind of like this. And yesterday, the new X-ray looked like this. You can see the difference well. Do you understand? How should I put it? My mummy had been also told these things... - before she died. - Oh, come on. Now, the water is ready. Bud daddy...He had had it before already. The cancer. It's not hereditary. 2 cubes of sugar? Here you are. Listen, ...when examinated did you also told doctor? About your daddy and mummy? Why have you done it?! You make me so- - Why have you killed him? - No! You little creepy freak! I didn't want him to tell me... that I must die. I don't want to! You have no right to tell me. Prokopa! - Murderers! - No! She was dead right away. Hit the window sill during the fall.. and it crashed her skull. She had a cancer. And didn't belive we will help her. We will find out ourselves. We have experts. This is horrible. She could have killed you. I'm sorry, I was sleeping like a log all night. Heard, they suspected her already. Old Heyna's found her handkerchief with his blood on it. It's all my fault, Karel. I should have known, she's mad. She was afraid that Josef would tell her, she's dying. That's not so sure about her madness. Maybe, it was like with me. She was telling him about her parents' death... and flew into panic at it. Luckily There was no scissors this time...only an ashtray. He made it even easier for her reaching out for ink. If only we had looked to her file... Come on, Who would study a family history? I have foretold all this. FRIDAY - Next report please. On my department, Prokopa Vlchkova committed suicide. 24 years old patient with a lung cancer. For her bed I have received Jarmila Dobanova... 33 years old, with hard case of gallbladder colic. - Otherwise, nothing special happened. - Next report. Dr. Hoshkova has asked the head of clinic for a health vacation Within 7 - 8 weeks. The committee agrees so I think we will even recommend it. Lord Marlow will visit our laboratories this afternoon. They've been lodged at Hubertus for 3 days. From now on, they will be lodged at Alcron. There was a party yesterday. It passed off by friendly mood. I will send you the bills this afternoon. And we will need some refreshment for tomorrow. Divish man, see to that please. Dr. Petera have promised some kind of informal speech at laboratory. Unfortunately, I will no longer be here. Thank you. Petera will get the post? With a few skillful men I will bring this hovel back to life. We will have the international reputation again. You are exceptionally skillful. I was thinking... You woun't do with Petera? Will you join me? No, of course. Thank you. You didn't disappoint me. No worry. No one will hurt you. The Czechs are a kind nation. See you at the funeral.
