How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? Sir....that girl.... l didn't know that girl was just 15 yrs old. Let him speak in English or Hindi. Not in regional language. l didn't know she was just 15 yrs old, sir. That means he is pleading guilty. Mr.Prosecutor, please sit down. Mr.Shantanu, your answer should either be a YES or a NO No, sir! Okay, let's proceed with the next charge. Charge against the 2nd accused. Zakhariah K V - Lieutenant signal officer has abetted and hereby supported the 1st accused in committing molestation of Ms.Nadira lmam D/o Jaffar lmam, 15 yrs on the 15th of April at 2.p.m. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

Many heartless people have queued up to give witness against you! There is only one option left. Take voluntary discharge and leave! lf so, you can seek a job in the coast guard or Sports department. lf it is a termination, Then, criminal proceedings, Jail...You know all that Only God can help you l'm ready, sir. Team DrC We don't need any valid reason to fall in love! But to feel a deep love, there should be some valid reason. What really happened for you to pine for her? There is really nothing in what l'd said so far! But that happened ...only later. Yes, come in. lt's your childish prank that has spoiled this man's career and life. No, uncle...You're wrong. l'm serious about this. l'm serious about him. Serious? You are only 15! You're not matured enough to take a serious decision about this. That's what the law says.

After 5 yrs, l'll show you l'll convince you.... ...all of you.. An obstinate challenge of a 15 yr old girl l only thought that much. But unexpected hopes were lying somewhere else. Then? Did she respond to you after five years? Yes! How? She erupted like... a bomb blast! Muthaapi is serious. He is being evacuated through the helicopter! Poorfellow! He has been bedridden for long. Pray to God! You continue What is it? Bro! Duva is also going along with him. Duva! What a deceit! Move...Let's rush.. We must not let her go. She will go definitely this time What's the problem, Koya? All such problems are triggered by people like you!! -What's it? -You take the bike! Duva, Koya's sister is exactly yourfemale version! She fell in love with a guy in Medical College. Knowing about that, Koya didn't send her back afterthe vacation. 2 years have passed. She boarded the ship couple of times after evading from Koya's sight. Some rascals like him, will inform Koya, and he will bring her back. Why? lsn't that guy a Muslim? That's not the issue here. lf she goes, Attakoya will be left alone. lf it's a guy from this island.... That is Koya's tension. How can she forsake her love? Oh! Sailing in the same boat?! Shall l go fast and stop Koya from going? l'll kick you to pulp, damn it! Do you want to intervene and get me beaten up by people? lf she is destined then she will go -Poor thing !-Who? You only. Please move. See you then. May the Lord protect him! Why the hell is it not flying! You did a good thing, doctor! Uniting lovers....whether in a story or real life. Everybody likes it! Ask him to fly soon before that fellow arrives. Hello, why the delay? Can't you fly? A Navy staff is also going to Kochi!! He'll be coming now. See, this is an air ambulance. l'm the Medical Superintendent. And l certified the evacuation. Patient can't wait for any Navy people Don't worry, ma'am. lt's only a matter of 5 mins. -We'll make it up in plan.. - How dare you say.. Who the hell is coming now? Doctor, l can feel the spark of a love affair behind you in this! Yes of course! Who doesn't have? Don't worry, l will come. Move aside.... Bro...there, she's!. -Dear Duva!-Oh Jesus Please come back, dear! Come back l say! lt'll not work out! Please come back. l will not be alive if you go. Why do you talk like this, brother? Come back. Come back, dear. Come, let's go Saeed, you go and assist! Doctor, do l have to take any medicines? Yes! This medicine is for you. Give way. Doctor is really smart. -She is not like what you see! -Much more than this?? -Who's that? - Navy man! Deeraj! l'm getting close to him to find the whereabouts about Nazeeb! That guy was gathering details about you from Attakoya! -Really? - Hmm Team DrC What's the name of that Navy man in the passenger list? NAZEEB lMAM Team DrC That was my last and final chance to find some information about her! That hope is also shattered! The very person from whose sight l wanted to hide... There l jumped straight onto him on the very 1st day! He came to know the facts and... fled from here! How can you be so sure that he's Nadira's brother?. Don't moan needlessly! Then, why did he lie to me that his name was Deeraj? ...and why did he collect my details from Attakoya? That must be of.. That boy went on 10 days leave He didn't quit the job and go! But one thing is confirmed. His dad's name is Jaffar lmam. So, you can relax for 10 days until his return! Forthe time being... didn't you say that she put a bomb after 5 yrs? Tell us about that incident. He again started! Five years must've passed! lt was when l was working in Alapuzha sports division, did that bomb explode! Who is that? Joseph? Who are you? Leave me. Lock him up! Ahmed Kutty! DYSP of Police! Sir, You are a Policeman? Sorry! You didn't appear so! Leave me.. No need of a gun! l'm not a troublesome guy. Where is Nadira? Who? Nadira lmam! Answer me. Dad, l'm no more 15 year old girl. You can't punish Shanthanu for this, that l love him, or that he loves me! l'm going away with Shantanu. Don't even try to bring me back. Officer! Nadira, where are you? ls Shantanu there or not? First tell me, where you are? Give the phone to Shantanu. Team DrC Did they hurt you? No! lt was very difficult to find you, but, not for my dad! So, l had to choose this route! lt's okay l'm sure he would've made you listen to a CD. Yes! Even after 5 years, without changing a word, whatever l wish to say, is recorded on that CD. But the condition of your heart is also like mine, l'll wait for you. Should l or not? You should! Stop it, Nadira! Dad, l haven't gone missing l went to visit Ajmer Sheriff and am back home now. l'm so sorry. He showed us only the search warrant of Lucknow SP! Team DrC ''The sky reclines, the shore swings,'' ''The time hums, the star listens.'' ''Like waves, she spun in me, a net of dream'' ''At this time when eyes close'' ''And the darkness flows'' ''Will the mirage of dark cloud disappear or change?'' ''The sky reclines, the shore swings,'' ''The time hums, the star listens.'' You? Are you here to take Nadira away? ln the last 6 years, not even once l have come to your house, Sir! She troubled even you forthis and after taking so much pain, she found me! So, isn't it my responsibility to come here?! After all, are we all not men of honour, sir? Oh! So that's your answer! You can't go with him without my permission You can go, ...but after my death!. Your word ''l WlLL WAlT'' is what made me come here! l told you, right? ... if you want to go, then go after my death! lf you really want to go urgently now, then, l'm ready to die before my time. No, dad! l'll not go without your permission! Even after your death! lt's my promise to you! l will wait for your permission. But, till then, you shouldn't question my wait! The number of days Nadira will wait for you, hatred for you will increase equivalently Some day your idea will change, sir. The day you understand who l am! Team DrC l'm sorry. l can't do anything more than this for now. lt's a question of Royal blood! Will take time, right? l can understand. One fine day father will accept. But l don't know when that day will come!... l don't have any right to force you to wait till then. But yes...l'll surely wait. Me too! This is not called WAlTlNG but WAlT FOREVER! You are aiming for an impossible thing! Her dad is mad. and his daughter is even more mad than him! Trying to put your life amidst that as fixed deposit You are totally mad! You're a moron! What else can l call you! Suppose during sleep, that Hamam.... lmam, right? Yes, lmam! Suppose he dies of heart attack during sleep Then your condition will be like... What's that flower called... Anthurium? Exactly! Anthurium! That will be your condition. or assume that old man agrees on the verge of his death, What's the point? Even she will turn grey like you. Do people love only for that reason? No, to kneel down and worship. According to my knowledge, there is only one meaning for UNlTlNG l'm not sure whether it has other meaning in Hindi. -Assume there's! - Yes. Didn't she put any other bomb? To put bombs, is she a native of Kannur? l didn't mean that. Didn't she try to contact you afterthat? She was contacting me over the phone for three years. l'd also been to Lucknow couple of times to meet her. She was studying in the Sufi center overthere. Team DrC Quite often, she sends CDs to me. Few Sufi songs in her own voice, and some love quotes in Sufism which makes me crazy! ''When a heart burns a heart, when heart is in love, God is merciful...'' ''One who sacrifices life for love... one who stakes life wins love...'' But in the CD that came at last, lt was not her voice. l'm Jaffer lmam here. lf you hadn't interfered in Nadira's life from distance, yourfake love would fly away like dust in a gust of wind. That's why you seek reasons to keep herthinking about you. That Nadira keeps remembering you. Hereafter you'll never listen Nadira's voice. You'll die...waiting for her. What does it mean? lt's 2 years on.....there is no contact. Her mobile phone is switched off. l enquired all possible ways. And only came to know they have shifted from Lucknow. At such a dead end situation, l did an adventurous thing! Team DrC l broke the record in the Deep sea free diving! Risking my life and limb! lf this becomes a news, l thought she might contact me. lt became news but nothing happened. As he said that you'll not hear her voice any longer, Would that ruthless fellow have harmed her? That Nazeeb was my last and final chance of finding her. Would she have got married? Forthat, she has to die! -Or if she had died...-Shut up, you! That's why l say l'll shutter after knowing the facts! What all these -Nothing... l just thought... - Leave it.. lt's just a matter of 10 days Let that boy return! l'll somehow make him disclose the truth. Greetings!! We've a sad news. Muthukoya, 73 yrs old, died at Medical Trust, Kochi! His funeral will be held tomorrow 10 am at Mattanchery Juma Masjid Won't his body be brought back here? That's the fate of the inhabitants of this island lf someone dies outside the island, burial also will be done there itself. There is no way to bring back the body, and the relatives can never see the body. See you, then. Are you coming with me or going to quarters l'll drop you.

But quite a familiar face for you people. l warmly welcome Duva Mian Koya to this musical stage. You have to sing along with the Orchestra. Doctor's prank l suppose!! Does she sing?

Don't act smart! l know you are not behind all those cheers and fuss! l'm not a fool. Leave it Koya, Don't mess up things Certainly! lt was the support of people who are aware of her likings!! ls it you who's deciding about her likes and dislikes? Let's move, sister! Come.. Leave it, Koya! Why creating a ruckus for a silly thing? First, learn about LOVE and AFFECTlON! lf he doesn't know, somebody teach him please. Just a minute...Only for a minute, please. Then go and mess up! Actually, who are you? Doctor or a Teacher, to preach about LOVE? Going on and on about affection and love for a long time! What bullshit is that! By the by, who the hell are you to lecture about this? Were you a master in 16008 LOVES? Hey, mind your words! Don't dare point your finger and talk! Mind you! What's the problem here? Nothing, we're learning about LOVE! You go and compose your next song. The LOVE you mean is trampling over someone's life for an act in a left out moment! lt's only 2 years since she has been in love! l know those being in the waiting room for 10-14 yrs, and at last become insane realising that their life has gone up in smoke. By then life almost gets vaporized! -Water vapour...-Yes Water vapour! Let me ask you something! Do you think your life will go waste if you don't succeed in your love? ls there a huge scarcity for men and women here? -ls it? - That's enough! lf you again harp on this topic... Zakhariah, she doesn't know my nature. -Shoe....My shoe! -What shoo on this issue? Come! -Did l talk less? -Not at all! Only you and Duva are the right ones to talk about love! Yeah! So you recognized me!! l heard your speech as well. So, only that much, is it? Okay! Team DrC We told him about your yesterday's depression. Dad! lt's not about a Nawabian hangover for giving value to one's words!! But Cunning! Cent percent Cunning!! With Love Nadira! What's this? Nadira when you said you will wait, l did not have a worry with that, l knew with time your love will evaporate in thin air, and he knows this as well! That's the reason why he has started sending Dvds. That is what you think father! Even if we meet or not, whether we hear each other's voice or not.... our love will always live forever. l don't trust that! Do you believe in it? Beyond the limit! Do it and show What else do you need? Just one more thing. l'm Jaffar lmam speaking! Give this to him on my behalf. l've not asked you this so far! Dad, l never asked you why are you so much against us, just because he's a Hindu? You're wrong. On my Naval base, my junior officer, do such a thing with my 15 year old daughter? l will never forgive that. When you got married, even mom wasjust 15 years old. Did you wait to kiss hertill she became 18 years? Stop this nonsense! That was in old times! Pack your suitcase! We are leaving tomorrow. Why did you call a taxi? l would have dropped you at the airport. -No...l..- l called the Taxi You don't need to worry! l'm not going to Kerala, l am going to Ajmer! l have got a teacher's job in Sufi center! What do you mean? if your decision changes, you can come and meet me. Sister! The same applies to you as well! When l saw you and learnt about you, l immediately rushed to see my dad. Before l make any decision l thought l would let you know. l'm taking Shantanu to Ajmer. l'll get them married Marriage? Who are you to get them married? l'm Nadira lmam's brother. When dad is not alive, Then, it's the responsibility of a brother to take care of his sister. Team DrC Good thing, l'm glad that you have more affection towards your sister! Now you can leave! Now, it's enough if l alone decide. When shall we go to Ajmer? You will only lose in this, Naseeb. lnfact Nawabian blood hangover is not for your dad, Jaffar lmam, but for your sister! Her word.....the value she gives for it, even her love towards me, is the value of her word in the past! lmagine, l come along with you Valuing the word she'd given her dad, she'll not even bother to see me! Anyhow, thanks for the kindness you showed to me. l will wait. We will wait. Whatever it is, l don't have to shutterfor sure! That's enough. ln any case, let me give it a shot! Bye! What happened? What did that boy say? Seems she is fine there. Thank heavens! l had come here to tell you something else also. Before that.. Sweet Kiss for you.... Why all this ? There's a reason! Your dialogue yesterday was inspiring! After hearing that, Duva's mind has changed a bit! Didn't l tell you about an Engineer's proposal for her.. She's now agreed. You sinner! What a mess! O Koya! l blurted out in depression! l want to meet Duva now. Yes, What is up? Do you know... No boats will go to sea till tomorrow noon. Some security problem, it seems! ln the pretext of inspection, Navy people took away two boats that belonged to Sports! ''Manju'' that is scheduled to leave Kozhikode tonight, has been ordered to leave only tomorrow afternoon. Team DrC -May l? - Yes. Good evening, Doctor! l'm Captain Rajan Jose! lf there is any medical evacuation for the next 48 hrs, you should inform us. What's the problem, sir? Sorry, l can't disclose to you. Thank you. 4 cups of tea, please Let me go and check the ship's schedule. Are they rushing on getting any Tsunami information! Only if the Tsunami arrival is kept a secret, will the people get killed, right? There are no ships for four days. Oh Mother Mary! Do l've to tolerate him forfour more days? NADlRA What are you doing? lsn't Nadira in Ajmer now? Her SlM is with her dad, right? This is not Nadira but Jaffar lmam! Wait, don't take it now.. For the ruckus created by his son, lt might be a plan to hook you, l suppose! Let it be anything, attend the phone before it gets cut. Put it on the speaker. l'm Jaffar lmam speaking. my daughter has a wrong belief that l will accept you before l die that must be some other fathers who might change their opinion as they die l am not one of them, My son also on your side... for him l am dead long back, The situation is such that l can't wait any longer, Forthe sake of all, l've to take up a decision . Now l will give you a chance. Come to Kochi. Nadira and me are at Kochi But only for the next 24 hours. When? Tomorrow. l will come. You will not come. l'll come. How will you come? Swimming? Do you know the distance between Kochi to Kavaratti? 218 nautical miles! And for the next 4 days there are no flights on hire, and even if you leave immediately by boat, it will still take you 48 hours. l am waiting eagerly for you. Even if l die, l will still come. Promise me this talk will be only between you and me, it should not reach my kids. Do you agree with that? l agree! l will wait for you ...eagerly! Oh! All this commotion is solely to block you! Let's not stand here anymore. What's the problem? What did he say? l'll tell you! Come to the Lighthouse! Team DrC -Don't allow anybody to the lighthouse. -Okay, sir. What a disaster is this! Hell with his Challenge!! Bloody 24 hrs time! What bullshit is this! He knows that even if he blocks all the outlets, you will do some adventures in the Sea. At least in that way, he wants you to be killed! What adventure can he do in the Sea? Swim? Talk practically! He has also hampered the boat service. Even if boat-travel is possible, based on his nature... When you cross from the territorial sea to the Open sea, ...he is sure to have engaged goondas to kill you! Hardly would there be any evidence left behind! You will not go tomorrow! What the hell will happen? Dad and daughter will go back the way they came!. Just because you didn't go there, she is not going to marry somebody else! Moreover, she is not aware of all these happenings. Whatever it is, rather than drowning and dying, Waiting will be much better. Let them run around and sweat profusely for 24 hrs. Nothing will happen if l don't go. Nobody's life will be at risk! As you said, she will go back without being aware of the happenings. But...in case l am able to go.. ..This waiting will end tomorrow. That's why l promised to reach there tomorrow risking my life. And it's not to prove my manliness l am accepting his challenge! lf l happen to die, let me die. Only for this, l.. l must go What happened? A captain from the Navy has come... to inspect the Lighthouse right away. You lift him up nicely and show him. Let him inspect and go. -lf you let him inside, l'll kill you, mind it. -Ask him to come tomorrow. Planning to trap us from every side! Seems the captain wants to inspect now. So, you want to go. Whatever you said, is right! You must go. Koya! Suggest some way! Suggest something! There is a fisheries boat..in the Yard. Work is almost completed! lf you drive in full throttle, You can reach there by tomorrow night. But evading their sight, how can l take the boat from Yard? That's the second thing. First is Hussain! Come...Come l say! Don't hang around, Come Koya! Team DrC Here comes Shantanu sir! Come! Come! Oh! All of you are here! -ls Hussain there in the Qawwali? -He'll be there! Sir...that will not work out.. Let's move. -What happened? -Propeller is ... Won't it be enough if we bring it here? Will your dad go and bring it from Kochi He was calling me SlR so far, and calling me names now? Both of them are over the phone for a long time. Do you think it will work out? What happened? l called up Sherin! l didn't disclose anything!! l can't reveal your name to her There are no possibilities for Evacuation tomorrow. Or if it is for today, then someone must get heart attack!! Most probably it would be me!! Navy people had gone there also! Any Evacuation order can be done only after informing them! So, that idea is also ruled out. Will you stop this bloody laughing? We'll surely win, sir! My friend's friend Farid, has a yacht! He is an avid racertoo! l only told them that it is for a bet to reach Kochi tomorrow! He demanded 2.5 lakhs! And l fixed it for 2 lakhs! -Any problem? -What problem? Tell me the rest. At early morning, 5 am he will come to the 2nd buoy next to the Reef! To go there, we have to row the fibre boat He has promised to reach Kochi by tomorrow evening 5' 0 clock. To reach yard at 5 am, we must leave at least by 2 a.m. l'll also come with you as there will be a rapid flow of water during that time. Surely you will win! lf not you, who else? lmmediately bring your fibre boat and fasten it there. lt's necessary! lsn't there a bulb glowing on that corner post? Hit and break it! Koya! Those people are there. They are after us only. Hold this. We don't have to wait until it is 1'O' clock Any moment those people may come in. Yes! Come, let's move. Come quickly. They don't patrol because of rain Call me immediately, while boarding the yacht. Gosh! Was it you? -What happened? - Here they go. What do you feel, dude? Feel like sleeping! lt's 4'0 clock! Wait for one more hour. Let him call. Wake me up when he calls. Hello! Jeez! Shucks! What happened? Come. Navy people seized the Yacht! They will let it off only tomorrow after checking the papers and permit. When we were half the way, Farid had called so we returned. Let her.....Ler her go back, dude. What you said was right. Even if l don't go, nothing will happen But...For me, nothing more can happen! But you.. Koya, why did you inform them now? Couldn't you tell them in the morning? lt's almost dawn. All of you go. l want to lie down. l'm very tired. Shall l also sleep with him today? No...l'll sleep. -Shall l? - No, leave. Team DrC Have you decided not to go? l must go. How? Need to use a bag of tricks like earlier days! As l intended! Evacuation! The patient is.. You or me? Me only. But, what is your illness? Not illness! But suicide attempt! Reason - Love failure! Will it work? But that devil Sherin... You've odds with her now.. l can tackle her. ..but l need your support as well. We two only, No one else. Even Rajeev and Koya should not know about this. Only then they will be able to react naturally. Team DrC Shantanu ditched us. Rush up. Oh Rajeev! My God! Shantanu ditched us. Come quickly. We need to inform the Police. Come quickly. Oh God! Please help......Please help... lt's like chanting hymns! Oh my God! Who is here to hear?. Please help....Help, please. Oh my bro! Shantanu sir ditched us! Save him at any cost. Call the people quickly. Rush....Call the people. Shantanu sir inhaled something! Oh my God! Give some first aid to him. Go quickly. My hands and legs are trembling! Oh God! Sir! lt's Poison! l know that, you fool! Are you kneading Paratha on his chest? Sir, call the ambulance quickly. Hey, no range for BSNL here! l don't get anybody overthe phone... Oh my God! What on earth will l do now? Give him some first aid. Whom shall l call now? -Call the Police! Shantanu sir inhaled poisonous gas! What will l do now? Run quickly. Let me call somebody for help. Wasn't that you who announced n the mike that day? Go and announce quickly ls he dead, then? l'll give you a smack! Go and announce. lnform the Pilot immediately. -Pilot?-Go and call quickly, Rascal Don't waste time and risk his life. Oh my God! Atta has come! Oh my Atta! Look what Shantanu has done! ls there any need for him to do this? Can't he at least tell me once? What the hell you were doing here, then? Had he given me any hint, l would've stayed awake! He only told me it's a poisonous gas. Why did he do this knowingly? No point in pressing! Give him artificial breathing through mouth! Me? Oh no! Get aside. Give me the phone. Here the Police has arrived Hello Sherin, Where are you? Quarters? Carry him soon! Move...move Yes, it's Carbon-mono-oxide! l'm not sure of that. Keep the cylinder in the vehicle. Ask the doctor not to treat him here... Send him to Kochi as early as possible. Zakhariah, get in. Keep the cylinder inside. Doctor has to get in. l will feel suffocated there.. Move quickly. Somebody call the doctor and ask her to keep everything ready. Speed up, you rascal! Don't take away his life! He has inhaled Carbon monoxide! lt's poisonous! He himself told me that one who inhales, will not survive more than 4 hrs Not sure what time he has taken this in the morning. So it was deliberate! Will anyone do it for fun? Doctor, just a minute. Planning to take away his life, keeping him here? Calm down.. Let me talk to the Doctor. What's this, Rajeev? What is his problem?
