SEOUL, MARCH 2006 Hyon-jun. You're late again. Sorry. There was a traffic jam on the subway. Here, have a drink. Thank you. Here you go. You didn't have to but thank you. I forgot that I'd let you borrow this. I'm sorry. Stop. I didn't mean it like that. Will you send me video letters? Video letters? In my favorite Japanese movie, people send videos to each other rather than write. But, I don't have a video camera. Here. Take this one. I bought a new one for going to Japan, so I don't need it. Let me show you. First, open this. Then push here to turn it on. This one here is zoom. Okay. Shoot now. The weather today is great. Tomorrow, I'm leaving Seoul to study filmmaking in Japan. So it's gonna be a while before I see this sky again. Ah! If you do it like this, you can shoot yourself. Hyon-jun. What? Can I visit you when I become fluent in Japanese? You can visit me anytime. I'll be waiting for you. Will you take me out for a meal? Very grown up of you, What? What's your plan? This is the last year of high school. I'm going to Japan. My mother will get remarried so she won't miss me, I guess. Come on. But I've already decided. "Campus Life 3" As you requested, I'm going show you the classroom where I study. What are you doing? I'm just practicing with my camera. Sakashita, why don't you dance there? Go ahead. But how? Maybe like this. So-Ra, dinner's ready. Okay. So-Ra... We need to talk tonight. You are such a nag. Why are you refusing to get to know him? How can I suddenly think of a stranger as my dad? Anyway, when will you let me go to Japan for school? That's a different subject. You can study Japanese here. I want to study filmmaking in Japan. I'm finished. Hyon-jun, I'm coming to Japan. See you soon! NAGANO, APRIL 2007 Winter has gone and spring has come. Mom got remarried and I was accepted to a university in Japan. I left Seoul and I'm on my way to the town where Hyon-jun lives. On Next Sunday Hello? So-Ra? Mom, I just got to the station. It took a long time. You must be tired. I'm fine. So what's the town like? I don't know. I just got here. Isn't it cold there? Be careful not to catch a cold. I'm not a kid anymore. Stop worrying so much. Yes, I worry. My daughter who's just graduated, now alone in Japan. Okay. Anyway, I'm going to try things out in Japan. Call me if anything's happening. Okay, bye. Is this it? This is it. Coming. It's the freshman. Aren't you So-Ra? Yes, I am. I'm Ohmura. Hyon-jun's friend from his part-time job. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Do you know me? Yes, I remember your face from his videos. Is Hyon-jun... here? He went back to Korea last January. Didn't you know that? His house in Korea caught fire, and his father died. He didn't call you? I've been trying to reach him but his phone hasn't been on. I see. Wait. These came after he left. He called and asked me to submit his leave of absence. Do you want to know his new address? 7 months later Two more months... Assignment: Year One 'Your Interests' And? Kaya, what was the reason that you became interested in this woman? Well... Ms. Hasemura often comes to the bar that I work at. And... she is pretty but... she comes and leaves alone. Never talking to anybody. So she is kind of a strange person. So I was... So you were interested in her mysteriousness. Right? Yes. That's it, exactly. Then why don't you film that mysterious part of her? Yes, sir. - Sounds good. - Thank you. Good job. Next... Choi So-Ra. Yes. Did you find a subject, any interests? I'm sorry. I haven't yet. It's your first so maybe you're over-thinking. I don't have a lot of friends, here in Japan yet so... It doesn't have to be a friend. Could be one of your neighbors or a foreign student. - A foreign student? - Don't you know anybody? Well... Sir, since Ms. Choi has come to Japan, I think she should film a Japanese. Why's that? Because I want to know how Koreans think of Japanese. She's Korean so she may feel things differently. Mr. Iizuka, I am not representing Korea. I didn't say that. Actually, you did. Okay. Right. "Interest." "(1) a quality of something that attracts your attention," "(2) special attention to something or someone." "Attention?" At, ten, tion... Excuse me. Are you alright? Did you hurt yourself? Get out! What? Get out! Okay. Are you okay? Welcome back. Good evening. What's in that big box? I found this job, delivering fliers. I can give them out at my club. - Really? - Sure. Thank you. What kind of fliers? Oh, pizza. How much do you get for each? Two yen each... Sounds pretty hard. It has discount tickets. Wanna order? It's on me. Such an easy kind of person to read. What is that? How would you feel, if you got a video letter like this from a man in love? So is this a video letter? Scary. What's "scary?" Who would send you something like this? I am thinking about sending this... I see... So, are you in love with someone? Probably unrequited. I didn't know that. But who? He's like a big brother in Korea. So-Ra, take a look. I've been seriously practicing tennis. Come here and touch it. Right here. Hard, isn't it? And this corn here is hard. See? It's really hard. How could it get this hard? Unbelievable. I'm doing too much, I guess. Minako, what does university mean to you? Let me see... the springtime of life, I guess. Uncool, huh? Must be our pizza. It's so late. Ask for a discount. Yes. I'm sorry. I've got your pizza. I am very sorry for making you wait for such a long time. I have no excuse and I am truly very sorry. Will you please not call my boss to complain? Excuse me. Stop that. Miss, please don't get me fired. Are you getting a discount? I'm begging you. I'll pay you your money. Thank you so much. I really mean it. The order was one Bulgogi Pizza with a coupon, it's 2200 yen. Okay. Thank you. MOTHER Hyon-jun, do you know this area? It's from the top of hill not too far outside of campus. Finally, I'm going to make my first film. The assignment is open Your Interests. So I need to ask you a favor. Will you be in my film, if you don't mind? I'm saving up to visit you in Seoul soon. So, could you please, get back to me? Professor. Can I have your seal? I didn't know that you knew Lee Hyon-jun. Are you the one that was his video pen pal? Yes. I see. On what day is he coming? Said he'd visit when coming in to withdraw. It's next Monday. Hyon-jun! When I saw this scenery in the tape you sent me, it made me feel strange. I thought this was my place but I realized, there is someone seeing it from the exact same position. Why didn't you keep in touch with me? After I went back home, I've been working all the time. My father died and my family lost our store. My mother got depressed. That made me think that I couldn't go back to Japan. But when I had the tape sent to my new address, I thought maybe I could try again. But I saw the tape, when you were talking about coming to Seoul... Since then I've been thinking... Thinking about seeing you... It was difficult for me. I appreciate... that you care for me but... Hyon-jun. I'll stop sending tapes to you. Is that okay? I'm sorry. Hello. I'm in my room. What's wrong? So-Ra, what's up? Nothing. It's not nothing. Tell me. What happened to you? What happened? They all changed their schedules for you. Don't worry. Don't "don't worry" me. Hyon-jun, it's your farewell party. Shin and all want to see you. But... But what? I don't feel like having one now. Lee Hyon-jun & Ohmura Atsushi Bye. From Minako So-Ra, hang in there! (o) Where were you looking at? Are you alright? Forget it. I'm so sorry. I'm very sorry. Mr. Matsumoto? A janitor here? Yes. Are you done with Hyon-jun? I am. Nice idea. Looking forward to seeing your "interest." Sir, I don't have a camera so can I borrow one of the school's? Of course, you can. Do good work. Yes, sir. Choi. You scared me. What are you doing? Some observing. Observing? Of what? "Your Inter..." No... It's nothing. Well washed. Well washed? Excuse me. Found him. What is he thinking? Mr. Matsumoto. Mr. Matsumoto! Good morning. You shouldn't be sleeping here. I'm terribly sorry. - Do your job. - Yes, sir. No way. Was he sleeping? But isn't he standing straight? Breathing through his nose. So-Ra, c'mon. MR. MATSUMOTO'S DAY 3:00 Wake Up 4:00 Newspaper Delivery 7:00 Breakfast (?) 8:00 Commuting to university 6:00 Dinner (?) 7:00 Pizza Delivery That would mean... Hello, I have a question. Does a particular delivery person deliver to a particular area? Then can I request a particular delivery person? I'd like to have Mr. Matsumoto. Yes. I don't have a reason. He's late. Great. Yes. Pizza delivery. Thank you. Here's your pizza. Good evening. You ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, 2110 yen with the coupon. From 3000 yen... The boss said, I'd been requested, and I thought you'd complained. I didn't say anything. Don't you go to Sinano University? I saw someone there that looked like you. Me too. I saw someone there that looked like you. Please. What is this? Your schedule, is it accurate? So you must've been sent by Mr. Kim from the Jinsei Family. Do you think I'm going to run away from this? Excuse me? Tell Mr. Kim, to stop this since I've been paying him back. Thank you. Excuse me. What is it? I'm interested in you. Stop that. It's weird. Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! You, again. This. The change, you gave me 10 yen too much. What now? Cast Wanted for Choi So-ra's Assignment Film So you are Chie So-Ra. It's Choi. I'm Choi So-Ra. Are you really from Korea? Nothing to do with Mr. Kim. "(1) Someone who is working hard everyday." "(2) Working more than 3 jobs. (3) Short hair. Thick stubble." "(4) Having a fear of heights." Is this about me? I wouldn't mind if you wanted it. What will you do? What will I do? Do you want to be in my film? I can't do that. Hey, it's done over there! What do you want from me? I don't know. You don't know? - Excuse me. - What? Don't you have any problems? I have lots of those. Tell me. Tell you my problems? Oh my god... That one? So this is it. It's all done. They don't match. It got warmer. So she really came. I didn't know I had so many. She's strange. Doing your laundry pretty much filled an entire day so I'll be back to clean this room. Mr. Matsumoto. Yes. I saw a young woman going in and out of your room. Who is she? Who could that have been? I know you're joking. You can tell me. It could've been a thief. What? You really don't know? I don't know. But there's nothing to steal. Looks nice. Your Interests Mr. Matsumoto I can't just shoot Mr. Matsumoto sleeping. 23 Dec. Sunday: Accomplishment! Hello! Going to work now? I've been working also. Getting enough sleep at work? Yeah. Your first smile to me. Actually your first smile to me too. Thank you for my laundry. That reminds me... This. Again? Laundry Bill: 9600 yen You spent that much!? Sorry, I know about your money situation but... I'm just a foreign student. Now I must eat pizza for lunch too. He's fast. Mr. Matsumoto, I want to finish this assignment by Dec. 23. How come? It's kind of important to me. Dec. 23, isn't that a holiday? Yes, and a Sunday so the day after is also off. Then I can sleep in on both days. Will you just sleep on the 24th? I've nothing to do with Christmas. What's your plan, Chie? It's Choi. Choi So-Ra. Oh, right. It's stuck in my head. You can call me So-Ra. I can't. We're not married or anything. What do you want to film about me? I don't know. Then what will you do? Mr. Matsumoto, when is your next day off? It's Sunday. I only have Sundays and holiday days. Then how about next Sunday for the first one? First one of what? Shooting days. If I don't sleep on Sundays, Chie, I'm sure I'll be dead. Then I'll wait until you wake up. I can't promise. Okay! By the way, my name is Choi So-Ra! That's right, So-Ra. Okay. What are they? Nice idea. Are these trash? How come? Stan shooting. I got you. I'll wait. Nothing? Not trash I see. Interesting. Hello. Hello. It's hot! Shut up and eat. Nobuto, does Mom cook proper meals for you? She doesn't. Always supermarket takeout. How come? She promised me she'd be a good parent, so I trusted her. Did she lie to me? Why don't you tell her? What did you say? Why don't you eat more? - It's hot! - Just eat. Impossible! So-Ra prepared this. Why don't you eat? - Too spicy. - Yes, you can. This one here is not so spicy. Hey. Is she your lover? Watch your mouth, kid! If you don't eat, you'll get no money. Okay? - No. Stop that. - Will you eat then? - Okay, I'll eat. - Okay, then eat up. Eat then. One child's ticket for Shinjuku. It will be 2280 yen. You have lots of money. No, I'm poor. How did you get the money? I guess it's kind of the responsibility of a man. Responsibility of a man? Never mind. Thanks. I'll come again. Don't. I have no money. No, returning empty-handed will make Mom mad. Last call for Matsumoto. You'd better go. Is So-Ra really just one of the students? Can you swear that on Mom? Yes, I can do that. Okay. Thank you for dinner. You're welcome. - Careful with changing trains. - I know, I know. Go now. He's not great, but it's still nice to have... somebody waiting for you. I decided not to run away from the debt, no matter how hard it gets. I will never do anything to make him embarrassed by me. I just have to hang in there now. Mr. Matsumoto, you're amazing. What? I think I'm a weak person. What are you saying? So-Ra, you're strong. You'll be fine. I'm sure that you're a strong person. I think you're fine. If you try hard, the future is waiting for you. Mr. Matsumoto. Mr. Matsumoto? I'm sorry. Was I sleeping again? This looks nice. It is soothing. Do you think so? I decided what to call my film. A Man and His Bottles What do you think? Am I the "man?" Of course. I'm embarrassed. I picked up this bottle on the day I came back to Nagano. It was on my way for a job interview and I saw this right next to dog shit. So I thought it would be good luck, so I kept it. Then I got hired right away so this bottle decorated my room. But I wasn't faithful to the first one. Doesn't this look like a female body? I found this in the back of a shop. It was dirty and looked like it was crying a little bit to me. So I replaced this with the blue one. But a few days later, I was asked to park a customer's car, and I hit a utility pole. And I got fired there. Then, I felt the nature of women as beautiful ones are hard to handle. What else... This one. This one is the beginning of my life. When I started working in Tokyo, I met a friend who swindled me. That's how I got into debt. I got divorced and I was totally alone. I wasn't working and went to the riverside to hang around. One day I found this on the ground among the stones. It reminded me of my childhood, first love and many things. I suddenly missed my childhood. I decided to start over in my hometown, so I came back to Nagano. Looking through like this, I saw a different world inside. So I spent the whole day looking and it wasn't boring at all. Look. You look like someone else. See, the rim's dented that's rare for a bottle. I like that kind. This one? I find it reminds me of myself feeling defective, so it soothes me. They're supporting me emotionally. "9 Dec. Sunday: Shooting" So-Ra, I think I can find some down here! Look! Here we go. See? There we go. Mr. Matsumoto, how did you know you could find bottles here? You can see trash around here so there could be some down here. Other trash will decompose but bottles will remain. What is this? This shape is rare. Maybe for some cosmetics. What? It says something. Ibokorori? This is really... It's very rare... Mr. Matsumoto, what is "Ibokorori?" Do you know corns? Yes. Someone at the female dorm has one. She would know this very well. That kind of medicine... I once put it on my asshole. That was horrible. Do you get corns on your butt? Not corns but warts, even more painful. It sounds better, don't you think? Somehow old bottles sound better. - Mr. Matsumoto. - Yes. I think you shouldn't put Ibokorori on your butt. Did you get that? I did. So you can play the guitar. Yes, but it's been a long time. I can't do it right. I can play the piano. Can you? There is an event. Do you want to join us? I have to play the guitar in this. My wife works there. Christmas Concert, 23 Dec. Hikari Nursery School" Unfortunately, I have to shoot on that day. With that man? Yes. I'm sorry. That's okay. Can everybody come to this Christmas party? Sure. Do you mean...? Yes. 16 Dec. Sunday: Shooting Done. What is this? So. Not right. So is this one. Oh, okay. So, so. La. That's right. So. La. What are you doing? So, la. So, la. Mr. Matsumoto, doing my name? Let's go. I did "so la so la" again. It's "so la so fa re mi." I'm not good at this. What? You're performing next week. Performing? Me? At the Christmas concert. Playing too? Not just to watch? Playing too. Let's practice. That's ridiculous. I can't do that. It'll be fine. They're just kids. Let's go. Mr. Matsumoto. Mr. Matsumoto! One more time. Shall we? You did it! I did "so la so la" again. Oh no, I did it again. So-Ra, let's not go to the Christmas concert. You'll be fine. You got it right once. I'm a very careless person. I know. As a kid, I was always being scolded for making mistakes. I had to stand in class and was scolded if not straight. Sol have good posture. I'm really bad at doing things in front of people. I'm sure I'll screw up on stage. Do be more confident. It's the last day. Last day? Didn't I say that I wanted to finish on 23 Dec? I see. So the 23rd is the last day. I see. Are you happy this is ending? I'll get lots of sleep. The last scene is you playing the bottles. Do a good job on it. Mr. Matsumoto, You, do well. So-Ra, you too. Do well. Okay. Mr. Matsumoto, can I keep the bottles just for tonight? Will you do it then? I'll mark the water line on them and bring them to school. Please practice more. How disappointing. There you go. You can keep them. I'll bring them back to you. Let me do that. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll be careful to not break them. Be careful. I often fall on snowy streets. So next Sunday, then, if you would please. Okay. Don't catch a cold. Okay. You too. Okay. See you. Yes? Good to see you again. Do you remember me? You are a friend of Hyon-jun. Yes, I am. It's been a while. Good to see you again. Have you been well? Yes... I brought something to give you. This... I returned that to Hyon-jun. So-Ra... Hyon-jun has passed away. A car accident. When I called him last month, he told me he'd been swindled by a man that he met on business. Hyon-jun was wondering if you were doing okay. You should keep this. I got it. Sir. Did you do something to her? I just called So-Ra but she wasn't her usual self. She didn't tell me why she missed last night's party. She didn't talk to me or even open her door. So, what did you do to her? Nothing. Don't you know anything? You see her more often. Do you know her number? You don't know? I don't have a mobile. What is that? I can't give you her number. Anyway, please leave her alone now, okay? Yes? Hello. It's Matsumoto. So-Ra, did you catch a cold? So-Ra? Are you cold? I brought you some egg sake. So-Ra? Something wrong? So-Ra? Are you okay? Is there something I can do for you? So-Ra. Are you feeling alone? So-Ra. So-Ra! So-Ra... Are you crying? Crying, right? So-Ra. Hello, So-Ra. So-Ra. So-Ra. So-Ra. So-Ra. What's wrong? Mr. Matsumoto, we can't play the bottles anymore. I'm sorry. Did you cut your hands? I broke your bottles. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Bring them here. All of my bottles. Bring them now! Right now! Yes. Why? If they are making somebody sad, they should be destroyed. Please stop! It's okay. I don't care if the bottles are broken. I care about you, not the bottles! Please stop. I care about you, Mr. Matsumoto! I wanted to say thank you. You taught me that the future is waiting for me if I try hard. So... I want to say thank you. Mr. Matsumoto, you are... a really great person. Silly goose. On Sunday, December the 23rd, a concert was held at a nursery school, where my professor's wife works. Unfortunately, Mr. Matsumoto didn't show up for this event. I played the bottles instead of him to the best of my ability. So-Ra, thank you, from a man not needing bottles anymore. Not trash Hello. Hello there. It's your mother. You haven't called me in a while. Are you okay? I'll call you more often. - So-Ra. - What? Happy 20th birthday. Congratulations. Thank you. You're an adult now. How do you feel? I'll remember this day my whole life. Such exaggeration. Mom, how is your new married life going? Why suddenly? Are you happy? I'm happy. Thanks to you. That's good. 이 부분은 노래입니다 (This part is a song)
