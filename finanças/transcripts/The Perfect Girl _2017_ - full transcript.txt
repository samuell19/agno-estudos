I used to major in Criminal Psychology in college. I've lived overseas. Do you know Lin Miao? Yes, very well. Why do you ask? Why do you keep asking about him? Why do you repeatedly start with that same question? I volunteered to do this interrogation with you police. What else do you remember from childhood? After having heart surgery, I've lost most of my memory. What I remember from childhood is that I liked a psychologist called Dr. Alice. Specialist, Dr. Alice Why do you like her? Why not? If you can learn to understand how to control someone, wouldn't that be cool? She once said this. Trust your beliefs. Trust your disguise. Trust and everything will come true. Do you still remember things from three years ago? Repeat Offender Has Been Arrested I had a surgery. What happened a few days ago? That day... NEW YORK, USA WEST 35TH STREET HILTON GARDEN INN Hello? Are you awake? It's okay. What's wrong? We can't hide it anymore. The police received a report 30 minutes ago. How did this happen? Because of the heavy rain the past two days, a dog dug out a bone from the garden. Don't worry, I will handle this. - I will approach her. - No. Or do you want to wait till the entire garden has been dug out before you deal with it? TAIWAN Good morning! Today, I'm going to introduce to you my personal butler. Let's see what he's up to. Let's go. This is absurd! Xin! You are such a pervert. I can't believe I'm making breakfast for a pervert like you. Gosh... I'm a pervert? So what? What? You like to tape others, right? Fine, then I'll tape you instead! Let me tape you. Give it to me! Running off, are we? Stop running. Give it to me. Stop! Let me tape you. Stop! Give it to me! Wait! Wait. Give it to me. You're still shooting? It's my turn to tape you. Weren't you making breakfast? Miao. I really love you. Gosh! I have to get going or I'll be late. This was in 2002. A mass homicide took place at an audition in Music College. Because the entire audition was videotaped, we were able to see what happened. Now, here's the question. Can anyone tell me what was the motive of Sun Kejie to commit such a mass murder? Why would he slaughter all those people? Anyone? Criminal Psychology Research Seminar Has no one among you studied music before? Is it John Cage? Your reasons? After 17 years of learning classical and modern music theory, he is still trying out in auditions. He wasn't happy about it. Young lady. Please elaborate. John Cage was an American pioneer in composing classical music. He emphasizes that any instrument, or any compositions of sounds can be viewed as music. Cage is best known for his composition 4'33". In which the performers do not play any notes at all. Any sound made from the audience all became elements into completing this composition. What has this got to do with the mass murders? As Sun Kejie began to perform, he looked at the clock. It was 4 p.m. As Sun Kejie stopped performing, he looked at the clock again. It was exactly 4'04"33. Because Sun Kejie failed all his auditions. And was also mocked for classical music and modern music theory. Stop right there. Are you sure you're playing the violin? I don't see your heart in this. After 17 years of learning classical and modern music theory... Buddy, if you think being handsome is enough to pass this audition, you should just go home. He then decided to teach those judges a lesson by allowing them to participate in the performance. As a result, Sun Kejie regards the screaming in the room as the most perfect music. What Sun Kejie committed is what we call criminal behavior. As to what we discussed about his motives and the research behind the cause of his criminal behavior both belong to criminal psychology. Studies of crimes and related criminal behavior as well as the science of criminal cause or reasons all belong in the category of criminal psychology. Simply put, it's about studying the minds of people. We, however, focus on... studying the minds of criminals. I believe that the human mind can be dominated. Hence, we are able to interpret. And hence the existence of the so-called abetted crimes. This is a thesis topic I have been working on lately. Anyway... There is a motive behind each crime. Whether we deliberate through the criminal's behavior or through hidden behavior, we can acquire clues for certain. That's right. Hidden behavior. Criminals subconsciously hide their trails and identities. Once you find those hidden clues, it's as if you've already found the perpetrator. Hi, my name is Yeh Xin. I know. I watched you grow up since you were little. I also know your dad. You know my dad? Excuse me. Lee Way You were saying that you know my dad? Excuse me. Hello? What did you say? Miao! CRIME SCENE, NO ENTRY Lee Way. According to the police, the human bones that were found died approximately three years ago. Check the record. How is this possible? Why would someone bury human bones in our garden? I don't know either. I was informed by the newspaper office. I got here as quickly as I could. This is Dr. Alice. I was at her seminar when I got your call. That's why she came along. Did you call your dad? He is in an overseas medical seminar and didn't answer my call. He should contact me as soon as he gets my messages. All right. Yeh Xin. You look pale. Why don't you have some rest? - I'm worried about your heart... - It's okay. I take my pills on time. Later, the police may ask you for further information to help with the investigation. They might ask you for... interrogation. I understand. I have become a potential suspect. With the human bones being found in our home, my dad and I are the most obvious suspects. We can't go anywhere. We haven't stayed in this villa for quite some time. Whatever information you need, feel free to help yourself. We've never come back after moving out from this place three years ago. The things we moved in during renovation were hardly used. Okay, thank you. Interview with Crime Novelist Hsu Meizhi Are you okay? Nothing. All these newspaper clippings were collected by my dad. My mom was a popular crime novelist back then. She was interviewed by many magazines and newspapers. Yeh Xin. Are you okay? Actually, my dad seldom talks about my mom. Maybe it's because she killed herself over postpartum depression after giving birth to me. This caused my dad great pain. I didn't know your mom committed suicide. I thought her death was due to a family history of heart disease. Look, she was standing right here in front of this big window. Even without a smile on her face, she still seemed laid back and elegant. Just like those white roses my dad used to buy for her on a regular basis. However, after her interview, she committed suicide on the same day. I was only eight months old back then. Yeh Xin. That year, she risked her life in giving birth to me. She didn't even care about her own congenital heart disease. She really loved my dad, but why would she do something like that? Dr. Alice, you study criminal psychology. You understand what criminals are thinking. Can you please tell me, what people are thinking about when they commit suicide? This... looks like a hat. It looks like someone was passing by the window. But the window was too high so you can only remotely see a person wearing a hat. But why did someone circle the hat? Look. This is the photo taken by the forensics after my mom committed suicide. There weren't any fallen rose petals on the table, nor on the carpet. Even the vase has gone missing. And according to the time showing on the two photos, there is only a difference of approximately half an hour, which means in between the leave of the reporters and the arrival of the forensics, someone else came, cleaned up the petals, and took away the vase. And, that person, might very well be her! So you suspect your mom did not commit suicide? Instead, she was murdered. Yes. My dad was overseas participating in a medical research seminar. I had a fever. The nanny took me to the hospital for medical care. A mother who risked her life giving birth to a child, despite feeling depressed and wanting to give up on her life, she would still make sure her child's condition was stable before committing suicide, right? Sometimes, the truth that you see is merely an illusion. Maybe, there's an unknown story yet to be discovered between you and your parents. And the bones dug out from the garden are starting to reveal the truth. The police says, at the place where the first set of bones were found, a second set of bones has been found. What? According to the investigation based on the features of the first set of bones and comparison with the missing persons, it may very well be the missing college girl from five years ago. Xia Zhihuan. The police also mentioned that the bones from the eye sockets significantly show traces of excavation. It's highly possible that while she was still alive, or after she died, her eyes were dug out. Her eyes were dug out? I'm sorry. I have other plans. I need to go. Miao... Miao... Miao! - You... - I really do have other plans. I'll catch up with you later. Miao! Xiao Xin. There's something I need to tell you. Before Xia Zhihuan went missing, Lin Miao was the last person she dated. EMERGENCY ROOM Help! What's wrong? We need to stop the bleeding first, hurry! Please wake up. Mi Chu, attempted suicide. Excessive bleeding. Notify the operation room immediately. Hurry! How is she, doctor? I didn't know Miao back then. His ex-girlfriend committed suicide. After being hospitalized, she went into a coma. After a week of rescue, she was pronounced dead. This is her diary. She seems to have forgotten about everything. She doesn't remember anything? No, nothing. That's the best. Don't let her know and don't let her remember. Not remembering anything is the best right now. For three months, the police initially suspected that Mi Chu did not commit suicide and questioned him as a murder suspect. Then, his parents passed away one after another due to illnesses. Lin Miao had a nervous breakdown, was mentally unstable, and was diagnosed with depression. He started accepting therapy. After that, we began dating, until now. But for the past three years, Miao has never mentioned a word about Xia Zhihuan. Miao. You're back. Why didn't you tell me about Xia Zhihuan? Do you think that I'm a suspect too? How are you different from the police then? Miao. I care for you. I'm just worried about you. That's all. Why do the girls I date all end up dying? Don't say that. Mi Chu died. Xia Zhihuan died. Will you too, end up... Miao. I think we should break up. I don't want to drag you into this. Miao. I trust that you didn't kill those girls. I believe you're innocent. I'm so confused right now. Please stop. Please leave me alone. - Miao. - Leave me alone. I want to go home. Miao! To: Bugzy Bugzy, I think I'm sinful. Otherwise, why would God punish me like this? Yudy died, Mi Chu died, now even Zhihuan died! It's me. It must be me who got them killed. If they didn't know me, they wouldn't be dead. Mi Chu, Xia Zhihuan, Yudy... My goodness, who is Yudy? Why did they all die? What does Miao have to do with all of them? Also, who's Bugzy? Xiao Yeh, I'm the future you. The person you'll be in 24 hours. You can call me Sinful Yeh. I am you, the other you, the evil you. After 24 hours, you shall commit suicide and redeem your sins. From you in 24 hours: Sinful Yeh Who? Who texted me? Is this some sick prank? Have you heard about mental disorders or multiple personality disorders? Of course. Did you forget I studied criminal psychology? Forgetting is a human self-protection mechanism. It lets us escape the pain, difficulties, and guilt we encounter in life. Freud once said that excessive use of defense mechanisms will result in denial and result in mental illness or result in maladjustment of the personality. In clinical practices, there are many examples. And many educated criminals utilize these methods to escape legal liability. But no matter how reluctant or dismayed I may be, I will not allow something like this to happen. You've said so much. Have a drink. Don't worry. I have ample time today. We can do this slowly. Miao. What are you looking at? Xia Zhihuan. Zhihuan was a very pretty girl. Especially her eyes. They were beautiful. -Zhihuan and I met five years ago -Zhihuan! at a summer camp. We got along well with each other. - And became close friends. - Sit tight. Okay. One day, we found a letter in my mailbox, the envelope titled, "To Xia Zhihuan, confidential." - Your letter. - Thank you. - I'm going to the bathroom. - Okay. After Zhihuan read the letter, she ran out the door. Later, as I was feeling really tired, I fell asleep on the couch, I waited until very late, but she didn't come back. Ever since then, she never did come back, and mysteriously disappeared. So this morning, you heard that the set of human bones dug out from my house resembled the characteristics of Xia Zhihuan. Is that what made you act so strange? The police questioned me as a suspect. Xia Zhihuan other than being good friends with you here, does she have other close friends? Five years ago, the police asked me the same question. Zhihuan is an orphan. She doesn't have any relatives. Personality wise, she was pretty solitary. She hardly had any friends. So, that means... Other than you, Xia Zhihuan doesn't have any other acquaintances. Then... There are only two possibilities that could have killed her. The first would be someone she knew. But you say that's almost non-existent. The other possibility would be someone she didn't know killed her. But why did that person write her a letter? To: Lin Miao Letters from Bugzy? Aunt Maylun and Wen went to Guam for a holiday. I hear that the sky is unbelievably blue. Speaking of which, I recall Xia Zhihuan, the girl you often mention these days. I didn't think you'd meet such a special girl at Summer Camp. Aunt Maylun? Wen Yajing? They're both Mom's best friends, how does Bugzy know them? Poor ventilation in the garage, college girl Yudy inhales too much carbon monoxide and dies. College Girl Yudy Commits Suicide in a Closed Garage What are you looking at? No, nothing much. I got you a glass of juice. I just remembered I still have other things to do. I'll catch up with you later. Why did every girl that's close to Lin Miao die? Also, why does Lin Miao tell Bugzy everything? Does she know something? To: Lin Miao Miss. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm looking for the person staying over there. The person staying there? I've stayed here for quite some time. Never have I seen anyone live there. Sorry, please excuse me. No one has ever stayed here before? The girl who has been writing to Miao for so many years, doesn't she exist? Then who wrote Miao all these mails? Hey, wait. What's this? Gosh, who still writes letters these days? Yes. He likes it that way. Old school and a romantic. But you wrote your name in both the recipient and sender columns. Who's ever going to get a letter like this? Really? How did I make that mistake? I am the recipient, I am also the sender. Miao. - Miao. - Leave me alone. I want to go home. To: Bugzy To: Lin Miao No, that's not it. That's impossible. Lin Miao can't be Bugzy. He wouldn't write a letter to himself. Xiao Yeh, I'm the future you. You who are kind will become the funerary for the evil me. Do you still remember Lin Miao who I mentioned before? Didn't I tell you that I don't know him? Why do you keep mentioning him? Or is he your friend and you want to hook us up? No, he is a patient of mine. I see. He has a habit. He likes to write to himself. Sending letters to himself? In other words, the recipient and the sender are both the same person. Then, he must have multiple personality disorder. Multiple personality disorder is an illness between mental pathology and psychology. For those who have multiple personality disorders, the main personality will never know whatever has been done by the other personalities. If... things really get out of hand, let's file for forensic psychological assessment. As you know, all these years she has gone through too much. That can be done later. The first thing right now is to make Xiao Xin leave. Otherwise, after she finds out the truth about Lin Miao, everything will be over. Hey. Sorry for asking you to come on such short notice. That's okay. I was also looking for you anyway. This hat... Picture of Dr. Alice with the name: Hsu Meizhi Did you know my mom? Dr. Alice, born in 1965, graduated from Ren Li University You and my mom should be of the same age, the same school, and studied in the same year, right? Are you her best friend? I guess you can say that. On the phone, you said you were going to tell me something about Lin Miao. I'm going to be frank with you. I was invited to participate in solving the two human bones case that was dug out from your home. I went through the testimony Lin Miao previously stated and his file from the psychiatrist. He doesn't remember anything that he has previously done. Even if someone else tells him what he has done, he feels like he didn't do any of it. So... So, as Lin Miao's current girlfriend and also a student majoring in criminal psychology, what genre of psychological illness do you think it is based on Lin Miao's current symptoms? I believe Lin Miao is showing symptoms of Multiple Personality Disorder. As a result, during his personality exchanges, he does not remember whatever has been done by the other personality. How... long have these symptoms been going on? Maybe it's just the beginning. Or maybe it has just been latent. At this moment, we cannot confirm the specific cause or the time the exchanges take place. Maybe it's intermittent or temporary. So what's the purpose of telling me this today? To remind you that those who were injured in his case were females that were closest to him. I hope you know how to protect yourself. Miao. You're back. Miao. What are you doing? I'm just burning some old letters. I have no use for them anymore. So I'm burning them. College Girl Yudy Commits Suicide in a Closed Garage How did Yudy die? How do you know about Yudy? I... She was the first girl I got to know in college. I liked her a lot. Everything was so perfect. We were so happy. I don't know why that day after she got home... Yudy: I'm so tired of living Actually, about Mi Chu, there was one thing I never told you. There's no way Mi Chu could've committed suicide. We've always been in love with each other. Once, an anonymous text said, "I love you too." At that moment, I thought she was cheating on me. I was so furious, so we got into a fight. But shortly after I left, I called her right away. I wanted to get back together. There's no way she would've committed suicide because of our argument. If she didn't commit suicide, then who could've killed her? I don't know. She was only a regular college girl back then. But I believe her death is not as simple as it seems. Miao. If you found out whoever it was that killed Mi Chu and found out who the killer was. What would you do, then? If I found out who the killer was, I would do everything I can to capture that person, then kill him. Xiao Yeh, I'm the future you. The person you'll be in 18 hours, Sinful Yeh. After 18 hours, the love of your life will find out the truth. He will never forgive you, hate you forever, and will never love you again! From you in 18 hours: Sinful Yeh To: Bugzy What are you doing? Where are you going? You're the one who sent Xia Zhihuan a letter. Lured her out, then killed her, right? You also killed Mi Chu and Yudy, right? Do you know? I did it because I love you. I've loved you for a very long time. Only after killing them can I truly be with you! I'm going to call the police. - I'm going to call the police! - No, you can't call the police. You can't call the police. I killed them for you. We can forget about all of this. I can give you all the love in the world. I can make you happy. I will never let anyone hurt you. Never! Please believe me. Please. Believe me, okay. I beg you. I didn't do it on purpose. I really didn't mean it. Why did you call the police? Don't die. I didn't do it on purpose. I really didn't mean it! Why did you call the police? Don't die. Please don't die! Yeh Xin. I really love you. Yeh Xin! Yeh Xin! Yeh Xin! Yeh Xin! Xiao Xin... Why did she want you to meet her? We can't hide it anymore. If this continues, it's not only Lin Miao. Even you and I will be exposed. That way, Xiao Xin will only get hurt. No secrets can last forever. Xiao Xin will find out sooner or later. You seriously want to bet your chance this time? Didn't you previously say it's best to forget? But if she doesn't remember now, we can't prove she has multiple personality disorder. Four lives are at stake here. And possibly even more. If sentenced to death, then everything will be too late. Xiao Xin will fall apart. What exactly did you tell Yeh Xin. It was about 30 years ago. Your Aunt Maylun and I with your dad's girlfriend at the time, Wen Yajing, were close friends. So, in the beginning, the woman my dad originally fell in love with was not my mom. That summer, your mom came to visit Aunt Maylun. Then she met your dad. You could say it was love at first sight for both of them. Your dad used to say your mom, Meizhi, was like a white rose. So elegant, poised, and generous. Yajing, on the other hand, was like a red rose. So passionate and outgoing. After twists and turns, your dad still ended up choosing your mom, Meizhi. Yajing became very upset and went overseas. Did she ever stay in contact with my dad afterward? I don't know about that. You might want to ask your dad, your mom, or even your Aunt Maylun. They should be clearer with the details. May I also ask if you know how to reach Aunt Maylun? I'm afraid not. We got divorced within a year after our wedding. Let me see... The last time I saw her was about three years ago. She paid a special visit to the villa you guys were staying at. The number is not reachable. Please leave a message. How is this possible? Miao is not answering at all. He seems to have disappeared. I remember the interview with the magazine publishers. It mentioned that the novel Mom nearly finished was called Love of the Roses. This seems to be the original manuscript. Maybe it was because Mom felt the same about Wen Yajing, so she wrote the story about red and white roses. I don't get it though. How does Bugzy also know Wen Yajing and Aunt Maylun? Dad is back. Xiao Yeh, I'm the future you. The person you'll be in 15 hours, Sinful Yeh. After 15 hours, you will leave the world with all of your sins and guilt. This is the only way to be liberated. From you in 15 hours: Sinful Yeh Who the heck is doing this? Who is it that keeps sending me messages? What will happen if the time's up? Why does Dad have eye balls in his room? Dr. Jee. You've been my dad's assistant for so many years. Can you please tell me what research has my dad been working on these years? All these years, the director has been doing research on how to help women stay young. He has studied a lot of historic information. And has done many experiments clinically and even dissected many female corpses. Do you know what parts? I mean, what does my dad need for his experiments? Mainly hair. Facial skin. Eyes and heart-related parts, that sort of thing. Zhihuan, especially her eyes, was beautiful. It's highly possible that while she was still alive, or after she died, her eyes were dug out. - Make way! - Yudy breathed in excessive gas. Likely in a coma. No vital signs were significant upon arrival at the ER. Please transfer to ICU. They were not just related to Lin Miao. They were all related to Dad as well. Both Mi Chu and Yudy were sent to the ER here for medical attention. Xiao Xin! Can you please tell me where my dad is now? The director is operating in surgery right now. You are lying. I want to see my dad. Hey, Xiao Xin! The director is really operating in surgery. I have an urgent matter! - Leave me alone! - Xiao Xin! Xiao Xin. Long time no see. You look pale. Are you okay? You don't remember me? I'm Dr. White. I helped with your heart transplant surgery three years ago. I've watched you ever since you were little. I had a heart transplant surgery? You don't know? You've been taking anti-rejection medication every day, don't you know? Isn't it for controlling heart disease? Yeh Xin! Dr. Yeh. Whatever you want to say, let's wait until we go home. Why did you lie to me? I had such a major heart transplant surgery, why didn't you tell me? You even kept it from me? I lost my memory, so you made me a new one. After all, how much truth is actually left in whatever you have told me? What else are you keeping from me? In your office, why is it that you have a pair of human eyes? You... You know everything? You've restored your memories? It doesn't matter how I find out about it. What matters is that I know now. Dad... Please just tell me the truth. Actually, you did not grow up overseas. I knew it. You grew up here. But unfortunately, you inherited heart disease from your mother's side of the family. Your life would be in danger if you didn't have the surgery. I can't believe you kept so much from me. Because of the illness, you hardly interacted with people at your age as a child. You would hide and stay home reading. Also, your appearance is a little... A little... Unique. Your head was stuck in the birth canal during labor. The doctor was worried that you might suffocate. So he used obstetrical forceps to help you out. But during the process, your cranium and face got damaged. You felt shame and withdrawn. You never interacted with anyone or said anything. And then? You loved listening to the radio. I remember it was when you were 15 years old. Through the social friend activity held by the radio, you met a pen pal. Lin Miao. You exchanged letters with him for eight full years. And I could tell that when you were writing letters to him, those were your happiest moments. So I am Bugzy. That mysterious Bugzy is me. No wonder both Aunt Maylun and Wen Yajing were mentioned in the letters. I know. Lin Miao is the only person you entrust yourself with. You care for him way too much. You simply could not live without hearing from him and his letters. Whenever Lin Miao mentions about meeting other new girls in his letters, it would bring you so much pain. You would bang your head hard against the wall. And my heart ached so much seeing you like that. Is it because I felt I was ugly so I never met Lin Miao in person? Yes. You felt inferior. Several times, you almost committed suicide. As a result, I... You what? So you killed people for me regardless of the costs. - Am I right? - Yes! For my daughter, I am willing to do anything. I killed every girl that was related to Lin Miao and transplanted their prettiest parts onto you to make you prettier. So what about my heart? My current heart belongs to... Your heart was transplanted three years ago. The original owner of this heart was Lin Miao's girlfriend, Mi Chu. Actually, Mi Chu did not die due to her suicide. - Dr. Yeh. - She just happened to be sent to my hospital. Yeh Xin's heart condition is unstable. Dr. Yeh, this is the information of the patient waiting to have surgery. If you did not accept heart surgery back then, the doctor said with certainty that you would die in three days. Organ Transplant Donation Agreement by Mi Chu But I wouldn't allow that to happen. I wanted to see my daughter live. Watch out for collision. Don't loiter around Who would have expected that during the heart transplant surgery, you would have major blood loss? It resulted in cerebral hypoxia. And caused your memory loss. Having a heart transplant is not a bad thing. Why didn't you tell me? After you were conscious again, I realized you had lost your memory. Yet we both felt it would be better for you to live under this circumstance. That's why we decided to keep everything from you. That is also why we moved. Dr. Alice said... criminals subconsciously hide their trails. Lin Miao was always complimenting Xia Zhihuan's beautiful eyes. You told me that you never wanted to see her eyes again. Therefore... The bones from the eye sockets significantly show traces of excavation. It's possible that while she was still alive, or after she died, her eyes were dug out. You murdered people for me. You even dug out their eyes... This is insane. You're a devil. Perhaps... it's time for judgment day. When I arrived at the office today, I noticed the upper shelf of the bookcase was open. I knew then that you must have discovered something. I can't keep it from you anymore. Don't worry. I will turn myself in. You will not be implicated at all. This is insane... You are insane... You are insane! Xiao Yeh, I'm the future you. The person you'll be in 10 hours, Sinful Yeh. Tomorrow, the love of your life Lin Miao, will find out you're the one who killed the three girls closest to him. Death is your only option. From you in 10 hours: Sinful Yeh I'm truly guilty. I might not have killed anyone, but those three girls died because of me. How can I face Lin Miao after this? To: Xiao Xin Yeh Xin, I'm leaving. From now on, I won't be around anymore. Take good care of yourself. Take care of your heart condition. Remember to take your anti-rejection pills daily. Dad. Here's your lunch. Ever since you were young, you lost Mom. I don't know when it started, -that our relationship -Dad. became so distant. I sincerely hope that you understand, it's not because I don't love you. It's just that there was so much that I could not tell you. Yeh Xin, you must live on and live well. I would do anything, anything, so that you may live a happy life. On his way to the police station to turn himself in, Dad had a car accident. He died on the spot. He has left me for good. And my dearest boyfriend, Lin Miao, will never know the truth. Dissociative Identity Disorder, DID, also known as multiple personality. They are mostly caused by trauma during childhood. Also, certain difficulties that was hard to deal with, Victims daze off and pull themselves from the actual event. A second personality emerges to replace the original in order to face various circumstances at the time and to deal with those situations in its place. Keqing... Are you all right? I often feel really tired being a woman. You love someone with all of your heart, but it ends up in tragedy. Seeing this picture reminds me of my mom. She committed suicide when I was still young. Maybe, because of love, she ended her own life. Xiao Xin. I know you want to be alone. It will just take you one minute. I just want to give you something. Your father gave this to me three years ago. Now, I feel this needs to be returned to you. August 23rd, 2009. A cloudy day. I think I've got nice fair skin too, why does Miao constantly compliment Yudy? Doesn't he know that girl is nowhere close to being better than me? I'm the only one who truly understands Miao. August 24th, 2009. A cloudy day. I can't stand how Miao is always talking about Yudy anymore. August 25th, 2009. The weather is sunny. Today, I stole some anesthetics - from dad's hospital... - Is this my diary? I started her car and closed the garage. That's because Miao keeps complimenting Yudy's fair skin. I'm so tired of living. I love you too. Mi Chu, attempted suicide. Excessive bleeding. Notify the operation room immediately. Hurry! For my daughter, I am willing to do anything. I will turn myself in tomorrow. You will not be implicated at all. Dad turned himself in for me. If I found out who the killer was, I would do everything I can to capture that person, then kill him. Miao... will never forgive me. When you see this letter, I will no longer be in this world. Hopefully, you'll remember the good things about me. When you see this letter, I will no longer be in this world! There are water stains on my suicide note because of my tears. The water stains on Mom's testament weren't tears. The water stains were as if they were splashed. That should be spilled water. Before that, there was a vase of roses. If the vase was knocked over and water spilled... But why clean it up after it's knocked over? Why must the white roses be thrown away as well? Criminals subconsciously hide their trails. You shot my mom. And knocked over the vase of white roses. Then you stained the white roses with my mom's blood. That's why they were red. You just couldn't leave them alone, could you? Dr. Alice. Or should I call you Wen Yajing? Because Mom resembled white roses, and you, red roses. A criminal subconsciously hides their trails. Also, the messages sent to my phone were you too, right? Your thesis is about abetted crimes. You are trying to convince me to commit suicide. I believe that the human mind can be dominated. Hence, we are able to interpret. And hence the existence of the so-called abetted crimes. Why would I do such a thing? Because you killed Aunt Maylun. The first set of bones found in my garden is Aunt Maylun, isn't that right? You killed her three years ago when she visited, right? Because she too, like me, found out about the hat. Did you kill my dad too? Did you? And then, you didn't want me to find out. So you used a fake diary and some text messages to instigate me to commit suicide? Your dad... He didn't die. You're lying. I don't believe you! I'm calling the police. Xiao Xin. I didn't write the ending. You did. Because you feel guilty. The diary is not fake either. Aunt Maylun hasn't contacted Uncle Lee for the past three years because she got remarried. I didn't help you with cosmetic surgery. You didn't become pretty. This is all in your own imagination. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. That's not me. That can't be me. Xiao Xin, you never dated Lin Miao. He wasn't in love with you. In fact... In fact, you proclaimed your love for him. But he rejected you. By the way, Lin Miao has already died. You've just been imagining him this whole time. You're lying. This can't be true. Let's see what he's up to. Let's go. This is absurd! Actually, you are Sinful Yeh. It's your main personality. You killed all the girls around Lin Miao. But he still didn't accept you. So you killed him too. But then... you couldn't deal with this outcome. So you lost your memory. This is her diary. She seems to have forgotten about everything. Xiao Xin lost her memory and doesn't remember anything? You made up the perfect dream. And imagined everything with Lin Miao was true. You really thought you were dating Lin Miao. I didn't do it on purpose. Forgetting is a human self-protection mechanism. It lets us escape the difficulties and guilt we encounter in life. It's not me. The police have confirmed that one of the sets of bones found in the garden is Lin Miao. You killed him and put him in a wooden box. Why did they leave me? Now it seems that everything is my fault. Everybody is scared of me. Nobody dares come near me. Everyone treats me like a murder suspect. Why? You still have me, I'm different from your ex-girlfriends. I love you more than they do, I promise. I won't be like them and suddenly leave you. If you really love me, later tonight, come over to my place then. Miao. Miao? Did you take all these photos? And, this bracelet belongs to you, right? Mi Chu didn't commit suicide. You killed her! And Xia Zhihuan too. You sent the letter to lure her out. Then killed her, right? Miao... You murderer. Do you know? I did it because I love you. I've loved you for a very long time. Only after killing them can I truly be with you! You... This is insane. - I'm going to call the police. - No, you can't. You can't call the police. I killed them for you. We can forget about all of this and start over. I can give you all the love. I can make you happy. I will never let anyone hurt you. Please believe me. Please believe me. You're scary. You're scary. I really love you. I really do love you. You're scary. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't die! Miao. Miao! Miao! After my professional psychiatric evaluation, I can confirm that Yeh Xin is mentally ill. It is not suitable to charge her under regular legislation. I suggest to transfer her to a psychiatric rehab center for long-term observation instead. She thinks her ugliness was her mother's fault. Therefore, she hates her. The mother figure does not exist at all in her mind. Because she once saw a photo of her mother, father, and Wen Yajing at home, she treated her mother's friend, Wen Yajing, who no longer is involved with their current lives as her own mother's image. At that time, her mother was invited to be a guest professor in an American college. Therefore, she lived overseas for a long period of time. Later on in her memories, she only remembers her mother solely as a renowned Asian psychologist from overseas, Dr. Alice, and worshipped her. You and my mom, should be of the same age, the same school, and studied in the same year, right? I was in her class. Actually, I am her. Yeh Xin also thinks her father should be found guilty. Because as a doctor, her father failed to stop the tragedy of craniofacial deformities during midwifery. Therefore, in her imagination, her father died trying to save her. You mentioned that you gave her medication and provided counseling for her identity integration. Who is it that remains in her right now then? Xiao Yeh? Or Yeh Xin? Three years later The doctor wants to see you. In the past three years, we've talked quite a few times. Yet, every time, you would show up with a different identity. There is always a name to that identity. Can you please tell me who I'm speaking to now? That doesn't matter. What matters is how to leave this darn place. I've stayed here long enough. In fact, if you can assure that your condition is improving, you will soon be able to leave. Doctor, I'm sorry. I've done terrible things. - Really terrible. - Let me tell you. I've seen her doing many bad things. Screw you! If you don't let me out now, I will kill your entire family. Now tell me. Who are you? It's not your business. You are not a professional doctor. You can only rely on your own determination in order to leave this place. Even if we commit crimes again after being released, there's nothing to worry about. - Because there won't be a death sentence. - There are many incompetent judges nowadays. How long do I have to stay here? They have no brains at all. According to the current law, our sentence should not be this long. -What you hear now -When are you going to let me out? are voices from other people in your head. - They are controlling you. - Hey! I'm warning you. - They are not real. - You'd better shut up. I know who you are. You are one of us. Come back! When the heck can I get out? -You don't know -I'm really busy. - because you are drunk? - Talking doesn't solve anything. Don't panic. I'm very well. Can I go home now, please? Can somebody take charge, please? It's so messed up in here! - Come back. - Yeh is my last name, - but I forgot... - Tell me. - Yeh who? - Who are you? - I want to go home. - Climb up. - Shut up! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Come back. - Shut up! - How long do I have to be locked in here? - Tell me! Enough! All of you shut up! I'm here to help you. If you keep messing around, I can't help you even if I wanted to. The only way to leave here is through teamwork. Let's continue. Do not interrupt us. Please? All right, don't be scared. Answer me slowly. - Who are you? - I am Yeh Xin. Some people call me Xiao Xin. Good to know you're back. Xiao Xin. Thank you, doctor. It's good to be back. This time, we may need more time. Of course. I understand. Very well. Now, let's begin. Xiao Xin, you look good today. I'm sure you are aware of the purpose of the evaluation today. Once you pass these questions, you may leave right away. So I have some questions for you here. First of all, since you are leaving soon, how do you feel? I'm very touched. Thank you for always taking such good care of me, Dr. Ann.
