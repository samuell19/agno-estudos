Swirl Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me with you Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me so I can love you. My mother My mommy The mommy God gave me If death comes to take me, Mommy will miss me Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me with you Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me so I can love you. Went to the bush to cut some wood Forgot, and cut some rod instead, Gave the devil a slap in the face Knocked the hound's mother on her head Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me with you Take me, honey-skinned girl Take me so I can love you. Girl dressed in white Tell me how much it cost Coz I want to write my name On the scraps you tossed Grandma, it's time for your medicine. Oh Bastu. Grandma, Grandad's calling you. What is it? Where were you? I was at the party. Can't keep me away from a party these days. I'm there at the drop of a hat. And here you are. Daydreaming, won't stop drinking rum long enough to come along with us. Lazy as a log… better that way… otherwise you'd get there, hit the bottle… and then I'd have to carry you back home… Like I was pulling a cart. Drunk as a coot, it would take an ox to get you home. Or a wheelbarrow. And I can't be dealing with that. So you stay put. You stay here, watching the box. Until you nod off. And I'm there having lots of fun. At the party. Dancing. Now I'll even be able to go dancing. Feliciano, oh Feliciano. Feliciano… Branca. Oh Branca. How'd it happen, Grandma? What happened was your granddad went to sleep. Me too. He in his bed, me in mine. When I woke up, I saw him still. I took a look. And saw he was dead. So I called Branca. Branca, oh Branca, go call your dad. Tell him Feliciano has passed away. What is it Batatinha? What's up? Are you crying? Haven't you ever cried, Grandma? Me no! Never? Just once. But that was a long time ago. I made a deal with your granddad that he wouldn't cry. And he asked me not to cry either. With him, it was a case of a bottle of cachaça. To cheer him up. Time doesn't stop, it's us who stop. Oh, Aunt Maria. Hi. Excuse me. I'm no broken house, no fallen wall. I'm no chamomile tea, to cure an aching head. Drizzle collects in the cup of my hat, I won't marry no widower, even if he falls in my lap. Daddy where's mommy, where might mommy be? I won't go to sleep until mommy comes home to me. Don't cry daddy, don't cry. It's me who has cause to weep. You'll find another woman, but I'll have no mommy to keep. Daddy, where's mommy, where might my mommy be? I won't go to sleep until mommy comes home to me. It's that Feliciano keeps appearing, you see, Maria? Even Rosângela has noticed. He keeps hammering away. Working the bellows. The bellows makes a right racket. Even disturbs the neighbors' sleep. She heard it, and then the other day she came and asked me about it. And I said it's just Feliciano playing tricks on me. He just keeps making mischief. I heard it, went to check, but didn't see anything, so I went back to bed. I see. So... I figured: it must be his spirit, then. His soul… That's about all you can say really. Why don't you get up and go see if that's really what it is? Whatever happens in my house I go there to... I do go, then I get there and there's nothing. Call him. Call him. And if he comes to me looking even worse than before? You'll give him a hug, a last kiss. Ah, not on your life. That'll fix things for you. No way. No way? Not a chance… The man's only been dead five days and you're already scared stiff? I'm not scared, it's just he'll be in a right state. But that's your fault anyway. If you just go look, but you don't… But I do go to see. You're scared. No I'm not. I go there, I check. The hammers, the machines, the bellows. And the door's closed. Even Rosângela came to ask me about it. But you know… those who are dead and return… they can't open doors. They slip through the cracks… Ah, found it… it was put away. Imagine, you're just what I was looking for. Branca. What's that, grandma? A pistol. To shoot with. Shoot in the street. When I was young, I used to like shooting. Fun and games. A ruckus. What do you think of all that? I did lots of stuff in life, but not now. But I had no fear. Not even today. It's just everything is harder now. When we're having hard times, we quieten down. Otherwise, if I could still … I'd show them how you kick up some dust. Because a ruckus is fun, it's good. It's enjoyment. You just can't kill anyone with it. Of course, no one knows what it's done in the past. With its owner. The first owner. Who knows if it killed someone, or if it never did. If it tried, if it didn't. What about you, would you shoot? Would you have the guts? No, I wouldn't have the courage. With me it's just bang, bang, bang. I'll leave it here. You were pretty butch to go shooting, weren't you? Oh, shooting's with me. Hold it and see how light it is. Hold what? Pick it up and see just how light it is. It's cool. Pretty, isn't it? It's noble. You who wants to be a policewoman, stick that in your holster, eh? Reminds me of granddad. So come the crack of dawn. So come the day as well. So come the heart of my love. Of the one I wish so well. If only I could be a macaw. A macaw or a tanager So I could make my nest In the tresses of your hair. When I look at that band And see a red flower I remember my love. Who is now elsewhere. The moon is rising Round as a ball of yarn I recognize my love From the tresses of his hair. What do you want with the pistol? So you're not right in the head, What are you thinking, about life? With God before me I'll get there. Have to get my eyes fixed, coz I can't see a darn thing and you're taking advantage of that. Be very careful, Feliciano. Because life's a loveable thing. So come the crack of dawn. So come the day as well. So come the heart of my love. Of the one I wish so well. When I look at that band And see a red flower I remember my love. Who is now elsewhere. Big talkers don't do nothing much. I've been all over the place. And now I'm not afraid of anything. Branca. Yes. What are you doing? Hanging out the washing. I was dreaming of São Paulo. I was flying over it. São Paulo is pretty. All lit up. Have you ever been to São Paulo? Yes. But only in a dream. You must have seen that on TV. No. I saw it in a dream. Speaking of which... the television guy came round looking for his installment. That's his loss. Who told him to do business with an 82-year-old man! You look like you're angry? No. Don't waste your time with anger. Just joy. It's so hot. I'd love to just jump right in. What? Into this water. I sure ain't getting in there. Pirapora is a beautiful city. Yeah. Very beautiful. I think it's nicer here than in São Romão. I'd like to live here, to study. So do it. Get married, and move here. I'd live here on my own even. Right, then. Don't marry. What do you think of the place? Branca, for me, anywhere is good. Wherever I go to live, is fine. Holy Maria! Lord of Glory. Do you know how to swim, grandma? I know how. I just don't swim no more. Why not? Because I went right down to the bottom. I knew how to swim, and wanted to swim like a fish. Anália's run away, I don't know where to. I call for Anália, Anália doesn't answer. Forgive me Anália, I wept for you, For you, my dear, where I was born. Sing it now. Anália's run away, I don't know where to. I call for Anália, Anália doesn't answer. Anália's run away, I don't know where to. I call for Anália, Anália doesn't answer. Forgive me Anália, I swear to you, To you, my dear, where I was born. Forgive me Anália, I swear to you, To you, my dear, where I was born. Grandma! Come here, Grandma! Right. What is it? I like to get the lunch made early, that's why I wake up early. I don't like rushing the cooking, no. I like to do it slow, calm. Turns out all wrong. Doing things slow, now... that does it right. Wait for the rice to cook, the garlic to sizzle… the bacon well fried… to add that taste to the beans. Mix in the coriander, to give it that flavor… you'd even think there was meat in it. But it's just coriander, just seasoning. It's the seasoning that counts. Are you trying to say my cooking's no good? No, it's not that it's no good, it's tasty, but doing things slow makes it better. Patience is very important. I can't be peeling pumpkin no… this knife… is heavy. So let me finish then. Because… this pumpkin's hard. The knife's blunt. So use this one. Give it here. It's that my arm's sore. So leave it, let me finish. So I'll stop then. No, I don't like to stand idle. I don't like to just stand around watching other people work. So go finish your rug, then. No, I'll finish this first. As I can. You just keep complaining… Well tell me something about school, then… what you've been studying… poetry. I love poetry. Speaking of that… this year I'm going to see if I can start doing the nursing technician course in Pirapora. If not here, then in Pirapora. I'll leave you here in Preta's hands. For you to see… how great she is. I'm not saying Preta's great. I'm not saying that you're no good. I'm just saying that… I'm just saying how things are… but you don't want me to give you any pointers. I'm listening, aren't I? August is coming, because the wind's picking up. Aunt Maria. Hum? So what was... The story they've made up now? Don't know if it was made up. You sang it, though. Who told me doesn't lie. I sang it? At the church, the day that girl's boy was baptized… at the mass. I'm going to ask you, please, the things I teach you, don't go spreading them about. But I didn't... You can't spread it about. But I never sang it… You did… I know you did… I'll call Jeromin… Jeromin... he doesn't even like the church, he prefers to stay at home. Jeromin was at mass with me… I didn't sing that song. Me and Jeromin just sat there. I don't even remember that song there. You were singing "Daddy, where might my mommy be." Inside? Inside, sitting in the pew. But I didn't sing it, aunt Maria. I'm telling you I didn't sing it. God doesn't sleep, no. No, he doesn't sleep! If you didn't sing it, then God punish me. I didn't sing it… If you didn't. If you did, then the punishment is yours. Listen to what I said at the Good Lord's cult. But this stuff about me singing "Daddy where's my mommy," I didn't sing it. I swear by Our Lady of the Rosary. I did not sing it. Right, okay. I didn't sing it. So the punishment is mine, then. What's the news from São Romão, Branca? Other than you turning up… no news, no. Where were you, Preta? I went up to the see the movement. But there's nothing happening. And your fiancé? He stayed there. The wedding's off. And you and your boyfriend? I haven't seen him for a month. A month? Did you have a row? You seem kind of down. Despite everything, I'm not sad. Life goes on... The good part is that you're here, no? Absolutely. Couldn't stand it anymore, anyway, for some time now. Seemed like a long time to me… two months… For someone who'd never been away… It was nuts, on your part. What? It was nuts on your part. I don't think it was nuts. It was an adventure. I wouldn't chance it… But the trip was fine, Grandma, you know? Yeah? I sold the pistol… got the money here, do you want it now? Not now. Let's get in first. Sure. You said you had been seeing granddad. Are you still seeing him? Yeah. He's there getting up to mischief… Really? Yeah! Meddling around, hammering. Right. And these sunglasses? The optician gave them to me. Said I have to wear them night and day. Let's go this way? This way we'll get home quicker. It's a short cut. Branca wants to go study in Pirapora. Branca? Yeah. Says I can get by with Preta. But I don't know what the future holds for Preta. Why does she want to study there? I don't know. If she wants to go, she can go. I won't argue. And Preta's wedding is off. Really? She doesn't want to marry the lad no more. He keeps fooling around. She's had enough… You know? You're sad, I'm happy. Soft is what you are. Be gone with you. Leave the workshop to me. Now no macho's going to sort this out. You're dead already, what else do you want? Enough already… I'm tired. Exhausted just listening to your nonsense. Get up at midnight to work. So get away with you. On your bike. Preferably a motorbike. Yeah… but your work is useless now… you can't get paid for it. You're working for people for nothing. I'm clearing up this mess. What comes goes. Grandma? What are you doing out here in the dew? Imagining life. Grandma, you'll catch a cold out here. Then I'll take a tablet to get rid of it… I won't have you sitting outside catching a cold. Let's go indoors. No… I'm just relaxing. Watching time go by. For God to help me on my way. I'm not happy with this. Well… that's how it is. I just want to rest here awhile, so that I wake up well tomorrow. Grandma, it's late already. Let me think… No, think indoors, grandma… let's go… Yeah… One way or another I guess I'll take your advice. They say those who don't heed advice, listen to wretches, so… Ok, let's go! Hi, Dona Maria. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. How are things? Just fine... Where are you going with that suitcase? I'm going to Urucuia. I didn't get a chance … to send a message. So I'll go myself. You know your own mind. It's the tools, clothes, I'm going to give the lot to João da Mata. Do you think he's going to want it? He's his brother, so he's got to understand. And if he doesn't want it, I'll chuck it in the river. I reckon. At least it'll give me some peace, won't it? The kids don't know where I'm going. You're the only one I'm telling. So if folks start asking, you don't know either. That's it. You're dead on there… Don't say a word… because folks are mighty curious. Yep. I already know it. They want to know what it is we're up to. Ah go… go with God. Jesus help us all. Amen. Us all, and may he walk beside you. Make this journey in peace. Go there and find what you're looking for. Batatinha? I can't find grandma anywhere. She's not back yet. See if you can find her, will you? Bye. Branca? Oh, grandma… Break, break the palm heart. I want to see it break. I want to see… I want to see it break. This night I couldn't sleep just thinking about you I'm going to stop loving you So I can get some sleep. Come, come old palm tree. Palm tree, don't sway no more. The girl when she marries Hank panky nevermore. Break, break the palm heart. I want to see it break. You break it there, I'll break it here… You're not forgetting anything, are you? I don't think so. Ah! That pair of sandals, let me get them. How long is the course? 2 years. So I'm going to be stuck here alone all that time? No. Whenever there's a holiday, I'll be back. Or you can come visit me, too… If I go there, who's going to look after grandma? Well… I'll be back here all the time. There's nothing else for it, no other solution, it's this or nothing. I've thought of all possible ways. But now this is the only option. The only one I could find. They don't have enough classes, is that it? They don't have enough people to make a class here. Send photos by Orkut. So you're really leaving tomorrow? What time? Early. And your papers? In my bag. This goes in the bag too, of course? I wasn't forgetting, no. If you want to forget it, I'll use it. I won't forget it. Even if you never lent it to me, I borrowed it on the sly anyway. I suspected as much. You'll look after grandma, won't you, Preta? If she forgets her medicine, you remind her. If anything happens, you let me know, for the love of God. Even in the middle of the night… If you notice anything different… anything at all, take her straight to the doctor, OK? Hello my people of São Romão. Welcome now, with you and for you, the band, Corpo Suado. Oh, take me with you My longing I want to go too My longing When I get to the top, I'm afraid I'll fall down Take me with you Take me with you My longing Girl, don't you remember My longing That ardent evening My longing You forget, but I remember And I miss it like crazy Take me with you Take me with you My longing I went to the stream to swim. Like a fish. And I looked for the deepest part there was. And swam. Then came a chill in the base of my spine…. I did a cartwheel and darted straight back up. I was standing there, watching, when two fish appeared. Two golden Dorado so bright and shiny that they blotted out the sun. And the bush became just like them. All a yellow glow… And it stole the sunlight. I kept watching. It passed, made that swirl and dove and the girl says: I never saw this fish here before. These dorados. They've not been seen here before. I kept to myself, didn't want to say anything. The result; someone started saying that I had contact with the fish... With the fish, the golden dorados. Now why… I don't even know why. We neither begin nor end. We are neither old nor young. We just live…
