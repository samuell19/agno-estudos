(RKO fanfare music) (dramatic music) - I'm getting something for you right now, Mr. Corbett. From Honduras. Imperative you reach Port Honduras with Lisa no later than June 18th. Prieto. (paper tears) Prieto. Isn't that the general who was hiding back in the hills? And the one who was president of Honduras? - Sure of the date, huh? The 18th. - Yes, sir. That came through clear. - Thank you. (boat creaking) Captain, I booked passage for Honduras. It's imperative that I be put ashore there. - I'm sorry, it's impossible. - I'll raise my offer. - Same answer, Mr. Corbett. I can't make port in Honduras with a revolution brewing. Company's orders. Insurance rates. - All right, suppose you make your own price. - I don't intend to haggle with you, Mr. Corbett. Our first port will be Nicaragua to deliver the five criminals to the prison authorities. - All right. Sorry I disturbed you. (tense music) - Any idea what business that man is in? - He never told me. Paid for his ticket in cash. Could be coffee, bananas, or-- - I thought so. He has the manners of a peddler. - Don't be too nasty, Harry, darling. The man may be a gun runner. (dramatic music) (keys jangling) (dramatic music) Good evening, Mr. Corbett. Did you find what you were looking for? - Goodnight, Mrs. Sheppard. - Goodnight. (dramatic music) (door bangs shut) You know, Harry, it isn't safe on deck. I could have fallen very easily. (dramatic music) - Where are we now? - North northwest of Santa Rosa. - How far is that? - 20 miles. - 20 miles, eh? That's about three hours? - Roughly. (tense music) That river here through the jungle, that's about three, maybe four days. (tense music) (paper rustling) Send this message to General Prieto. Prepare the fireworks. I'm arriving with Lisa. Arrive Port Honduras, June 18. (dramatic music) - How can you possibly get to Honduras by June the 18th? - You just send the message, huh? (tense music) (knocking on door) - Mr. Corbett. (door bangs shut) (tense music) (keys jangling) - It's no trap. You won't be shot in the backs. - Hmm. I have to be very careful, amigo. In Nicaragua I'm worth 100,000 pesos. Dead. In Honduras, 250,000 pesos, dead. (chuckles) Where do you go, senor? - Guatemala. No questions. Nothing but beautiful women, plenty to eat. Plenty to drink. - I think I, Reyes, the tiger of the lowlands, will like this Guatemala. Yes, I, I think I will like it very much. - Fine. But you see, now you can be the tiger of Guatemala. - Bueno. I will go with you. We will all go. Sure, why rot here and die in prison? Well? - Senor, I would row across the ocean to be free. - We understand each other, Reyes? - You're the boss. (keys jangling) You give the orders. - Don't make a move, Reyes. Until I tell you to. (dramatic music) We ought to be off Santa Rosa by now, huh? - Not yet, sir. About three or four miles. - About 20 minutes? - Make it 30. (boat creaking) (man whistles) (suspenseful music) - Just keep quiet and nobody'll get hurt. (suspenseful music) I'll tell you what to do. - But no shooting, eh? - No, let's go. (suspenseful music) (knocking at door) (tense music) Let's go. (dramatic music) Go back to sleep, Mrs. Sheppard. - Where are you taking him? - I'm going to show him some of the places that tourists don't generally see. - Corbett, are you crazy? - You'd better do what he says. (dramatic music) (rifle thuds) (dramatic music) (bell dinging) (suspenseful music) (shipmate shouts) (suspenseful music) (tapping telegraph) (rifle fires) (dramatic music) - What was that for? - The operator. He wake up. I put him back to sleep. - I told you there was to be no shooting. (gun fires) - He is my cousin. - You want to join your cousin or do you want to go along with me? - (scoffs) Ah, he was stupid. Except for him everything is as we planned. We go to Guatemala. - Yeah. - Now, wait a minute, what am I doing here? - Sheppard, you're a very important man. You're going along with us in this boat, then they won't shoot at us. - No more shooting. Senor Corbett is the boss. - Get in. Get back in your cabin. - You did not say there was a woman. - We don't need her as a hostage, we have her husband. - Sometimes they shoot a rich man, but a beautiful woman, never. - Piracy went out over a hundred years ago, Mr. Corbett. - I told you to get back to your cabin. - If I do, my husband goes with me. - Sit down. - How brave would you be without this gun, Mr. Corbett-- - Here. Take care of your wife. Now, you can pick up your passengers a couple of hours from now. We'll light a fire on the beach. - You'll never get away with this. You'll hang. - Yeah, well, they'll have to find my neck first. Oh, give me your coat. (waves lapping) Come on, give it to me. After all, we wouldn't want the lady to catch cold, would we? There. Now, let's go. (dramatic music) All right, over the sides. You, too. - You forget, I'm a passenger. - Come on, out. - Don't you want me to help, Mr. Corbett? - Help your husband move fast. - Oh! (water splashes) Oh! (oar thuds in boat) (birds calling) (tense music) - We need some matches for the fire. - Senor Corbett has the matches. - Mr. Corbett has everything. - You may as well keep these. - Gracias, senor. Still no matches. - Never mind. Where's Corbett going? - Upriver, maybe. - Why? - (scoffs) I don't ask. - I can understand you and the other men risking your necks. Anything's better than going back to prison. But Corbett? - Maybe he's murderer, too. - Maybe. And maybe Corbett has other reasons. Money, a goldmine, a hidden treasure. If I were you, I'd stick close to Corbett. Might be profitable. I need a match. - You see, when you get home you can tell your friends how you took care of the pirates single-handed. - They come in handy, senor, these people. - You promised us! - He promised. Not me. - We've one thing in mind, will you get that straight? That's to go up the river. These two would be in the way. - No, amigo. We need hostages to get out safe when you find the gold. The buried treasure you are looking for. - The what? - The treasure. - Well, Sheppard, it kinda looks like you dug your own grave. Take the woman back. We'll keep the man as a hostage. - Senor Corbett, you do not understand. The man is a hostage against the police. The woman is a hostage against you. You know the jungle, we do not. You might leave us with the man and not care, but the woman... - Look, here, Mr. Corbett, we'll pay anything. - Talk to them. - 10,000? 15? - You've got it in gold? - On the boat. - Whenever you're ready we can all go. Boss? - I'm ready. - Such a small voice for such a big man. What cut you down to size? It wasn't the guns, was it? Why don't you kill me, Mr. Corbett? I'm sure that's the way you solve most of your problems! (dramatic music) - Pull your weight, Sheppard. (dramatic music) - Harry, let me bandage your hands. (dramatic music) - Put your coat on. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Look! (suspenseful music) (rifle firing) (suspenseful music) - Tigerfish. Eat a man like that. (dramatic music) All right, show's over. Let's go. (dramatic music) - All day long we row like slaves. No water, no rest. What kind of man is he? - He's a tiger. Like me. - Two tigers. (birds calling) - Look at him, counting out his dried up crackers. - I hope he chokes on 'em. (fire crackling) - You know the bandits in your country? - The big ones. Why you ask? - Well, maybe you heard the story. Might know the man. Maybe it was you. A couple of my friends, very rich Americans, went hunting and a very smart bandit kidnapped them, then collected $100,000 in ransom. - That is not easy. How was it done? - Oh, it was very simple. My friends wrote a note to the American Consul and the American Consul paid. In gold. - And the bandits? - Well, nothing happened to them. You see, my friends were very influential people. They got immunity for the bandits. - Are you as rich as your friends? - Richer. And more influential. As far as you're concerned, it would only mean one day's rowing down the river. That isn't much work for so much money. (fire crackling) - What did you say that got them so interested? - I've just been making arrangements for us to get home. - Sheppard's a smart man. He tells a story, gives us big dream. A hundred thousand dollars. - Maybe it's not a dream. - Maybe it's a trap. Yet, the bait is big. Maybe when we get to Guatemala, where we'll be safe, Sheppard will write this note for us. - (scoffs) Sheppard will not live this long. - Oh, I will take care of him. He is no more trouble than a halfwit like you. - I know enough to go back down the river. - All you know is to follow me. - I follow you to the prison. That is far enough. (scoffs) You talk much, but you are stupid man. (man grunts) (men scuffling) - Any pushing around, I'll do it. The trip on the river today saved us two week's walking. Tomorrow we'll save another two. Sheppard, I told you you dug your own grave. I'll put you in it if you make any more trouble. (birds calling) - You will not live to see me kill Corbett. - Darling, don't do anything else foolish. I'd be so helpless without you. (birds calling) I never wanted to kill a man until I met Mr. Corbett. - Come on, let's go. - We know why we're running, but Corbett is running even faster. - Running for gold. A lot of gold. - No man is free without gold. Not me, not you, and not even Corbett. - In my village there's a saying. A man who is free is wealthy. - Sheppard is wealthy and he thinks he is free. But I think he belongs to me. - I think he is, finders keepers, eh? - Hurry up. Dead man. (birds calling) - They will follow the river, of course, to Port Honduras. A fool would know this. And I am not a fool. Where are the messages that were intercepted? Very touching. Our ex-President speaks of Lisa. Imperative, he says, to bring her June 18th. And Senor Corbett. "Prepare the fireworks," he says. "Lisa is with me." Lisa! He is bringing money to buy guns for those ragged dogs Prieto calls his army! But there will be no guns four our stupid ex-president! There will be no fireworks. There will be no money! All there will be is a very dead Corbett. I want Corbett found and killed. I want Prieto pushed into the river. I do not want to execute anyone for failure. (dramatic music) - Sit up, Mrs. Sheppard. - I can't, I'm stuffed. Three crackers is entirely too much for lunch. - You could spare a few pounds. - Senor Corbett, I like the lady the way she is. (laughs) - Sit down, Sheppard! Shut up, Reyes. - All I said, Senor Sheppard, is your wife is a beautiful woman. - Till we're out of here, Mrs. Sheppard, you're just so much dead weight. (dramatic music) - Brazen slop. We have guns, why do we not hunt for meat? - Police may be after us. We haven't got the time. Oh, another thing, Reyes, don't eat anything you don't see the monkeys eat. - Reyes is no monkey. (jungle animals screeching wildly) (jungle cat roaring) There is no hurry. Reyes will prove he's no monkey when we get out of the jungle. - They won't bother you if you keep the fire burning. (fire crackling) Here. - Why didn't you tell him to come back when your husband's not at home? Isn't that what you usually do? - Oh, Harry! - You want me to go for a walk in the jungle so you two can be here alone together. - I thought you might like a drink. - Do you think I am blind? You think I can't see what goes on in front of my eyes? (insects chirping) - Look, have a drink. I'm too tired to quarrel. - Then stay away from Corbett. Keep decently dressed. - I haven't much choice as to wardrobe. Look, Harry, let's face it, we're not at home, we're in the jungle. We can't tell what we may have to do to survive. - Oh, you'll survive. All I have to do is close my eyes. - Maybe we'll both survive, darling, if we help each other. - The men I have killed. The gold. The women. (insects chirping) - So you think you need a little privacy? - I wouldn't be found dead in anything of yours. - Ah? (chuckles) Your being found dead doesn't concern me. I thought you'd be more interested in keeping alive. - He's right, though. The way that Reyes looks. - What can we do? - We've got to try to escape. - We'd never make it. - You think you're safer here? Look at Reyes. He'd like to kill you. We could follow the river. - Yes, but what if they-- - Shh! When they're asleep. (insects chirping) Now. - Not yet. (insects chirping) - I saw 'em. - But aren't we going to go after them? - They're your hostages, not mine. - Do you not care what happens to the woman? - She's not my woman. (insects chirping) - We'd better go this way. - Uh-uh, I'm sure it's this way. - I told you we'd get lost. - We're not lost yet. I know we're only a few feet from the river. - You know everything, another Corbett. - How much longer are we going to be on the river? - I don't know. Couple of days. - Why are you going to Guatemala? - Business. - I once did business with the mayor of Montoya. A mountain of strength. An iron will. The mayor had gold. On Monday, I pulled his mustache one hair after another. On Tuesday, his nails. And on Wednesday, the mayor led me to the gold. - Real interesting story. - Very interesting, Senor Corbett. - Yeah, now I'm gonna tell you a real interesting story. You know, one time two men went into the jungle, a man who talked a lot. Just like you. And a man who knew the jungle, just like me. They quarreled. The man who knew the jungle, he took a long, quiet walk. When he came back all that was left of the other man was a pair of shoes and a watch. It's a good watch. I got $70 for it in Panama. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Wait, Harry! (suspenseful music) (snake hissing) (dramatic music) (rifle fires) (suspenseful music) - Ants! They're eating me alive! (suspenseful music) - Here, Harry, take my hand! (suspenseful music) Oh! (suspenseful music) Corbett! (dramatic music) (bat chitters) Corbett! Corbett! (dramatic music) - Look, Corbett, I was nearly crazy. A bat or a vulture flew in my face. - Vultures come only after the dead. - When I took you off the Claire Louise, I offered you just one thing: That was your freedom. That's all you're gonna get. If you don't like it, you can go. As for you, you two can leave any time you like. If anybody chases after you, it's their business, not mine. Told you we haven't any time to waste. Now, I don't care what happens to any of you and I'm not stopping. Is that clear? - Tonight? (birds calling) (insects buzzing) - Cover your faces! (insects buzzing) Get under here. (water splashes) (tense music) (thrilling music) - The Tigerfish! (suspenseful music) - I may not be able to swim, but I can walk. - If there'd been any Tigerfish out there, you wouldn't even be crawling. Now, suppose you help clean up this mess, Mrs. Sheppard. - She is soaking wet. - The bugs won't mind. - Corbett. You save a man's life, he gives you gold. You save a woman's (chuckles) who knows? (dramatic music) - When the tiger reaches Guatemala, every woman will be his. Reyes will lead a great band again. - (laughs) The weasel thinks I forget my promises because he flatters me. I will lead a band again. But you won't live to join it. (insects chirping) (playful music) (toucan whistles) (playful music) (cockatoo whistling) (gentle music) - (whispers) The boat. (dramatic music) - (whispers) Jiminez is waiting at the boat. (dramatic music) (oar thuds) (suspenseful music) - I should have killed him last night. - All right, Corbett, I did offer him money, but you can't kill me for wanting to get away. - You think you can do a lot with your money, don't you? All right, then, wrap some of it around your feet, 'cause you're in for a long walk. Get going! (dramatic music) - Yes, darling, do get going. Unless we follow Mr. Corbett, we won't be going anywhere. (dramatic music) - What are you doing out here? - I wanted to talk to you. I have to talk to you. It's about my husband, surely you can see what's happening to him. He'll die. Or even worse, he'll lose his mind. - What do you want, Mrs. Sheppard? - I want you to take Harry back before it's too late. - You know that's impossible. - Nothing is impossible. (dramatic music) - Come on, I'll walk you back to the camp. - Please don't bother. - Mrs. Sheppard. Look, I want you to know that if anybody could make me change my mind and go back... - Goodnight, Mr. Corbett. (dramatic music) (boat chugging) (rifle fires) (rifle cocks) (guns firing) (boat chugging) - Were you with Corbett? - Yes. - Where is he? - In the jungle. - On foot? - Yes. - Ours is the reward, boys. We have found Corbett. (boat chugging) (heliograph clicking) - Corbett proceeding on foot through jungle. (machete hacking) - Wait! Wait a minute. - What for? - My husband. (machete hacking) - Sylvia, listen. Sylvia, please wait a minute. Maybe we should thank Mr. Corbett for sending help. - No, senor, you have to thank me. (machete hacking) (animal growling nearby) - Puma. (puma growling) (suspenseful music) (puma growling) (suspenseful music) (puma growling) (suspenseful music) (puma roars) (suspenseful music) (Sylvia screaming) (puma roaring) (rifle firing) (dramatic music) (rifle cocks) (dramatic music) (Sylvia crying) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (paper rustling) - We're in Honduras? (paper rustling) (dramatic music) Where have you been? In the jungle with Corbett? - The jungle can be very beautiful. - Where is he? - Why don't you go and look for him, darling? - I wonder how you'll feel about Corbett when you see him crawl. - When I see that, I'll let you know. - What do you think Reyes and his friends will do when they find out that we're not in Guatemala? We're in Honduras. - If this is another one of your clever schemes, Harry, I warn you: Corbett'll kill you. - He'll have his hands full explaining to our sleeping friends. They'll probably tie Corbett to a tree and burn him alive. (dramatic music) - Corbett, where are we? What's that? - It's a heliograph. (dramatic music) - Heliograph? What does it mean? - (sighs) Those are federal police. They've got us spotted. They're trying to figure out how to close the trap on us. - Federal police? Why? - Why? Dictator took over this country a few weeks ago and the president's hiding in the jungle somewhere. - So you are a gun runner. - Maybe. (wind rushing) (Harry laughing) - You don't know why I'm laughing. I just thought of something funny. Very funny. One time, my wife, Sylvia, fell in love with, never mind his name. I killed him. - You used a knife or your bare hands? - Money. - Money? - I found out about the man's investments, who he owed money to. I talked to his creditors, a banker, a broker... (Harry laughs) (dramatic music) - Let's go. Come on, Castro, you cut the trail. - We will follow. (birds calling) (dramatic music) Sheppard, sit down. (gun fires) (dramatic music) (guns firing) Soldiers are coming, Senor Corbett! - I'd save your ammunition till later. - Senor Corbett! - Are you coming with me, Sylvia? (dramatic music) - Now's your chance. Go ahead and run, they won't shoot a woman. - No. - You better go with your husband. - I'll stay with you. - You're crazy. (dramatic music) Let him go! - No! Wait, Sheppard! Sheppard! (guns firing) (suspenseful music) I had to get my rabbit. I cannot go to market empty-handed. - Hey, Sheppard, you better stick with Reyes. He'll take care of you. Think you can keep up with a man who's running for his life? - I'll try. (dramatic music) - How is this the police know your name? (dramatic music) - Well, we've gained about an hour on them. Come on, let's go. - There may be Tigerfish. - Well, there's only one way to find out. (water splashes) (tense music) (thunder rumbling) (wind rushing) - We're lost! We'll die in this jungle! - Shut up! You think I'm afraid? (wind rushing) - We can get in here. - Harry! What about them? - They'll be all right. (wind rushing) Reyes will take care of him. - I can't help feeling sorry for him. Worrying about him. You wouldn't understand that. - That why you married him? - Perhaps. Or maybe it's like he says, for his money. - Paying him back for that? - I loved him. Only he didn't realize it until it was too late. - Why didn't you leave him? - I was going to. But he wanted to try again. That's like Harry, he's always breaking something, trying to put it back together. He insisted that if we were alone things would be different. Didn't work out. (thunder rumbling) (wind rushing) (thunder rumbling) (rain falling) - Give me something I can fight! This jungle... - You're afraid, Reyes. You're afraid! (rain falling) - Did I not say I would find a place? (chuckles) And I'm afraid? It is not my wife who is out there with Corbett. Oh, maybe you will kill him like you killed the other man, huh? - Yes, I'll kill him. With a piece of paper. (rifle fires) (guns firing) (wind rushing) (guns firing) (rain falling) (guns firing) (wind rushing) (rain falling) (rifle fires) (hat thuds) - Trying to kill us with your gear, aren't you, Reyes? - Senor Corbett, the man Sheppard is going to kill with a piece of paper. (chuckles) - Piece of paper, huh? (wind rushing) (gun clicks) (fire crackling) - Looking for something, Mr. Corbett? That's right, I've got it. (knapsack thuds) Now, I warn you, I'll shoot. - Harry! Harry, don't be a fool. Corbett's our only chance to get out of this. - Maybe your only chance. You'd both like to see me dead. - Give me that gun. - I don't need a gun to kill a man. You know what this is, don't you, Corbett? When Reyes sees this, he'll make you crawl. - You'll murder all of us with your stupid jealousy. - Not all of us. You forget, our friend Reyes needs me now. - You think Reyes can get you out of the jungle? - You forget the map. We'll get out. - So my little rabbit has grown teeth, huh? (laughs) - I don't like rabbits with teeth. - The map, it leads us to the gold, maybe. - I will see this map, senor. - I wouldn't do that, Reyes. You're not out of the jungle yet. - Show him who is tiger. - Go on, Sheppard, give it to him. - No! - Give it to me. (fire crackling) Ah. (chuckles) What matters this little piece of paper to a man that's done business with the mayor of Montoya? We still have you, Senor Corbett. (wind rushing) When we get to Guatemala, I will have a rabbit to sell. Are we partners, amigo? - Partner like you could talk himself to death. (Reyes laughs) - Come, little rabbit. Let us go to market. (dramatic music) - Corbett. Here. - What's that? - Quinine for the malaria. - That's all right. (dramatic music) - Malaria. - Now soon we will see who gives the orders. (dramatic music) - Give me your handkerchief. (dramatic music) - Malaria. It's very bad. (dramatic music) - Quinine. - Tomorrow, Corbett or no Corbett, we go. - We can go, yes, but can we get out? - We cannot stay here. The soldiers are too close. (dramatic music) (rifles cock) Drop your rifles. - We are hungry, amigo. That is all. - Where do you come from? - A village close by. - I killed a boar. Here. You know the jungle? - Very well. - You can lead us out. - There is a village south. Two, three days. - Into Guatemala? - Guatemala is very far. A hundred miles. - A hundred miles? Where are we? - In Honduras, amigo. - You hear that? A hundred miles to Guatemala! We're in Honduras! - No, don't! I'll pay you. More than you've ever dreamed of. I'll pay you for Corbett's life. - What have you that is not for the taking? - Money. The money that brought Corbett into the jungle. - Corbett has told the woman his secret. - Oh, I know their story. First I will kill Corbett, then I will get the truth from you. A hot knife blade will loosen even a stubborn woman's tongue like yours. - Maybe so, but I'll lie a good many times before you get the truth. That'll take time and the soldiers are very close. - Where is the gold? - You'll spare Corbett? - What about me and you? - I ask only for Corbett's life. - Sylvia. - Agreed. Quickly, tell me, where is it? - How do I know you'll keep your word? - A happy man does not kill, senora. Besides, he'll die anyway. - Wait. (birds calling) (rifle fires) (rifle fires) (rifle cocks) - They were thieves. (chuckles) Banditos. Castro, come on. Not you. A rich man does not need to sell rabbits. A rich man does not need to drag a woman with him. For a rich man there are women everywhere! Adios, amigo. May he live until the soldiers find him. Tiger. (birds calling) - Corbett. President Prieto sent us. We... (dramatic music) - Quinine. From some bark Bermudez left me. - What do you mean, left? - Reyes and the others have gone. They took the money. - My wife gave it to them. She bought her life with it, hers and mine. - I bought your life with it. - I wondered what you'd tell him. Do you really expect him to believe that? - He knows it's true. - Not if he knows you. You mustn't condemn her too much. She thought you were dying anyway. - Well, I trust the freedom of a country isn't too much of a price to pay for your elegant life. - Bandits. Reyes killed them. - Oh, what do you mean bandits? These men are patriots. That's something you wouldn't understand. (dramatic music) - You can't leave us. - Oh, you think you're worth saving? Well, it isn't far to the village. (dramatic music) Well, you can get home on your own now. (dramatic music) - Whenever you're ready, my dear. (tense music) (Reyes humming) - Why do you stare? You must never stare at a rich man, my friend! (laughs) Have a drink. - He's in the village. He's come to kill us. - Ah, you drank too much already. (birds calling in distance) - Corbett. Corbett is here. - Corbett? (laughs) Corbett is dead back in the jungle! Corbett. - I have seen him. - Uh... If I pick up the money now, the drink will go to my head. After I kill Corbett it won't matter. - Supposing that he kills you? - Well, it won't matter then either. - Pigs. 50 Corbetts cannot kill one tiger of the lowlands. And you know why? Because Corbett has no gun. Anyway, the money belongs to Reyes. - Reyes. (rifle cocks) You heard me, Reyes. Come on out. (birds calling) (grass hut rustling) (birds calling) (tense music) (dramatic music) (rifle fires) (suspenseful music) - No, Corbett, no! (rifle fires) (suspenseful music) - Come back, you'll be shot! (suspenseful music) - Stay back, senora! - Bermudez, I want to talk to you. - Later, senora, after. - No, now, Bermudez. I'm coming in. Give me a gun for Corbett and I won't let him kill you. I swear it, I won't let him-- - No! If you... (flames crackling) (dramatic music) (villagers chattering) (flames crackling) (suspenseful music) - Reyes, here! Here! (rifle fires) (dramatic music) (rifle fires) (dramatic music) - A fire is burning at the village! (dramatic music) - It's Corbett. (dramatic music) (flames crackling) (guns firing) (flames crackling) (rifle clicks) - Senor Corbett. Senor Corbett! - What do you want? - Why do we have to kill each other? There is enough money here for both of us. - Throw your rifle out into the street and then talk. - We will both throw our rifles out in the street, senor. We will throw them out together. Well? As you say, senor. (rifle thuds) (rifle clatters) - All right, Reyes, come on out. - Come closer, Senor Corbett. I want to see your face when you die. - Well, I guess you've won. (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (horses galloping) - When I saw your signal fire I knew my country would be safe. (dramatic music) - I arranged for an escort to take you back to the coast. You'll be safe with them. - Thanks. You're going with them, I suppose. - Just a little ways. My work's finished here. I'm going home. - Home? - I'm a planter. Place needs a little taking care of. - It's hard to think of you as a planter. - Sounds a little respectable, doesn't it? - No, but not very exciting. - It isn't, except for the rain and the mosquitoes. - I've had enough excitement to last me the rest of my life. - I'll be at Port Honduras in two weeks. (dramatic music) - Come on! (dramatic music)
