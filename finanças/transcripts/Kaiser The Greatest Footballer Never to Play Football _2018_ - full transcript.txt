(wind whooshing) (sirens wailing) (static hissing) (tone beeping) (singing in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (birds chirping) [MUSIC: "Poema Ritmico Do Malandro by Sonia Santos]" [(singing in foreign language] [Brazilian soccer announcer] [Brazilian soccer announcer] [crowd cheering] [Brazilian soccer announcer] [light guitar music] [Narrator] They say that those who go to Rio do so because they are attracted by the bright lights. It is the city of opportunity a chance to escape the poverty and hardship of rural Brazil. Hope for a better life. But to make it in this city you need to have something other than just hope. This is Carlos Henrique Raposo. But no one calls him by that name. He is known to all as Kaiser. Kaiser, the German word for emperor. Derived from the Roman ruler, Julius Caesar. Kaiser, like Caesar, is a man who does not rely on hope, and like the man who bore his title before him this Kaiser also created an empire, a world where he was at the center, pulling the strings. (moaning) (all yelling) (bell dinging) At least, that's his version of it. There are many many others. To understand Kaiser's story, one thing needs to be made absolutely clear. (light horn music) Brazil loves football and football loves Brazil. (yelling in Portuguese) (singing in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (Brazilian soccer anouncer) [Carlos Alberto] Brazil is an inexhaustible factory of amazing talent. (Crowd Cheering) [Narrator] Over the years, Brazil has won. All there is to win. And we have done it in style. Braziliian style. [Be be to] Brazilian football is like an art form. It's technically fantastic. The creativity and skill of Brazilian players is indisputable. [Narrator] Brazil may not have invented football, but we certainly added Ginga to it. Ginga, an indefinable, almost mystical quality of movement and attitude possessed by Brazilians. It is there in the way we walk, talk, dance, and yes, in the way we play football. (crowd cheering) So, it naturally follows that those who add ginga to what is effectively a national treasue are loved and worshiped by millions, and can get just about anything they want. The high life, 1980s and 1990s Rio was the realm of the superstar footballer. And in this city, superstar footballers play for one of Rio's top four football clubs. But if a footballer ever played for all top four clubs, well, he would be able to have it all. [Eri Johnson] The first time I saw Kaiser, he was crossing the street… With such swagger that I thought… "That guy must be one of the best footballers in the world." [Ricardo Rocha] Kaiser is one of the most iconic characters in world football. [Carlos Alberto] Kaiser was cool, in every sense of the word. [Alexandre Torres] It was his lingo and vernacular… The way he walked, the way he dressed. [Roger Flores] He pranced around in swimming trunks flicking his long hair around. [Alexandre Torres] He had that kind of hair… And sunglasses. Those massive sunglasses. He would even rock a bumbag which is now completely dated. In my mind, he was a footballer. (singing in Portuguese) [Narrator] Now, a story about a football player who was popular and looked good in tight swimming trunks would be nothing special and it would be a relatively short tale. Kaiser's story is about much much more than that. [Buffalo Gil] I think he's the only person on the planet who for 26 years played football without putting on a pair of boots. I don't think he ever went on a pitch. He signed contracts with many clubs… But he didn't touch the ball. He didn't even know the ball was round. He was a professional conman. (light percussive music) [Kaiser] I took part in this documentary to tell the truth. In Brazil, footballers have always been fawned over. People in the football world have always been idolised and seen as special. That's why my nickname is Kaiser. My real name is Carlos Henrique Raposo… That's why my nickname is Kaiser. My real name is Carlos Henrique Raposo… Kaiser was given to me because other players compared me to Beckenbauer. Kaiser was given to me because other players compared me to Beckenbauer. Kaiser, the king of German football, the Pele of German football. They, not me, thought the way I played was similar to Beckenbauer. I didn't give myself the Kaiser mantle. The Kaiser title. They made it up for me because I had something. (singing in foreign language) [LUIZ MAEROVITCH ] He was always chubby, always chubby. Back then there was a beer called Kaiser. It was kind of a thick round bottle… And people would ask "Why Kaiser?" "It's because he looks like the Kaiser bottle." Then the Kaiser nickname ended up sticking… That was the story. [Kaiser] This is the story of an anti-footballer. I want you to use that phrase. An anti-footballer. I didn't play. I didn't score. I didn't kick a ball. It's not the story of the star player, of the guy who did everything. It's the story of an anti-footballer. [Be be to] He's been in loads of clubs. I think Kaiser's been all over the world. Not just Brazil but the whole world. I'm sure of that. (upbeat rock music) [Narrator] Kaiser was here there and everywhere including Rio's top four clubs. [Be be to] He played for Flamengo... [Narrator] The biggest club in Brazil with over 40 million fans. The list of great players include Zico, Romario, and Be be to. [Carlos Alberto] I met him in person when he approached me... He introduced himself as a footballer… And said that he'd played for several clubs in Europe. He wanted a chance to show his value as a player. [Be be to] He played for Vasco. [Narrator] One of the most iconic clubs in world football, named after the famous Portuguese explorer. [Paulo Angioni] Sometimes he would spend three months at one club… Four months at another, five months somewhere else. In the same year he would be at three or four clubs. [Kaiser] I was at Fluminese twice. [Narrator] Flamengo's traditional rival. Their derby matches are among the most intense in. South American football. [MARCIO MEIRA] He managed to train with the Fluminense first team… But nobody managed to see him train with the ball itself. [Kaiser] I was at Botafogo two or three times. [Narrator] The last of Rio's big four. Botafogo has produced more Brazilian internationals than any other club. [Be be to] He would come with newspapers, and ID cards of clubs he'd been at. [Junior] He actually managed to get into professional teams… That's the most incredible thing about his whole story. [Narrator] As well as the big clubs... Kaiser also played for the smaller Rio teams. [Kaiser] I had three stints at America FC, two at Bangu. [ Narrator] But Kaiser's career really took off internationally. [Kaiser] I spent three years at Puebla having them on. It wasn't like El Paso. El Paso was horrible. [Martha Esteves] At the time we didn't have access to the information… We have today in our globalized world… With Google and the internet. [Be be to] So I'm watching the TV: "The new signing, Kaiser." And everyone fell for it. "I can't believe he's at another club." [Alexandre Torres] He had some offer from Arabia, from France or Japan. [Be be to] He would vanish, disappear. [Eduardo Oliveiri] He had a photo of Paris Saint-Germain. He'd trained at Paris Saint-Germain. [ Renato Mendes Mota] Independiente in Argentina. He said he became world club champion… In a final against Barcelona. [Be be to] Then after about six months Kaiser would come back. [ Narrator] Kaiser's roster of clubs is a list that any average player would die for. But Kaiser was not your average player. [Be be to] Kaiser was crap at football. That's the conclusion we came to. He couldn't play for his life. [Ricardo Rocha] He only had one problem. The ball. He was good at everything but the ball was his weakness. [Eri Johnson] The ball wasn't his thing. Coconuts were. He was good with coconuts, not balls. [Narrator] In Brazil, people who are not very good at football, won't even get into a kick-about on a beach, let alone sign contracts with some of the biggest clubs in the world. Yet despite his lack of talent... Kaiser managed to do just that. But how? [MUSIC: Antonio Carlos E Jocafi "Kabaluere"] [Carlos Alberto] He turned up on a day… Where the training sessions was based around fitness. And he displayed an incredible vigour. [Kaiser]What I had was physical fitness, but it wasn't enough. You had to be skilful. Very skilful. [Carlos Alberto] We usually started off with fitness… And finished training with the ball. [Ricardo Rocha] He was wherever the ball wasn't. [Marcello Campello] The ball was on the right, he'd be on the left. The ball was on the left, he'd be on the right. If the ball was in the middle, he'd be in defence. The ball was in defence, he'd be in attack. [Be be to] We'd play piggy in the middle with Kaiser as the piggy… And he'd have serious trouble. Kaiser would run from one side to the other… And we'd just say "Get out Kaiser or we'll end up killing you." Kaiser was dying. Sweating loads. He was wrecked before training even started! I knew immediately that he didn't possess all the qualities that he claimed to have. [Junior Negão] He knew that he wasn't a footballer and that he never wanted to play. It's like a doctor who's scared of blood… Wanting to be a doctor. [Ricardo Rocha] After the game I'd tell him "Kaiser you never touch the ball." He said "Ricardo, I have a unique style of play." He was a cheeky bastard too. [Narrator] Clearly, Kaiser wasn't in it for the footballing glory. So what was his goal? [Kaiser] I would sign a contract then take the cash advance… So it didn't matter if the salary came in or not. I'm not one of those players who sees out his three year contract. The idea was to get out as quickly as possible. [Be be to] He was always faking something. His whole injury charade was amazing. [MUSIC continues] [Gonçalves] After two sprints he felt something... He put his hand on his leg… And he asked to come off. He was always faking. Injured ankle, injured thigh, he'd snapped a tendon. [Kaiser] There were no MRI scans back then so I faked being injured. [Buffalo Gil] He would sign for a club and stay with the physio for three months. Then he would get injured again. [Marcello Campo] Centre forwards have to score or at least assist goals. But it's easier to hide from the game as a centre forward. I think that's why he played there. If I had to symbolically kill my grandma to not play, I would kill her. I would get a phone call saying my grandma had died. I would do that not to play. I didn't want to play. [Alexandre Couto] We were in the dressing room getting changed… And he put his hand in his bag and there was a 'brrrrr' There was a cell phone noise. Then he takes out a big brick thing that opens like this... [Kaiser] "Hello". He was like "I'm just talking with the people over in France..." "Sorting out my contract." He used to mix English with French. "'Tres bien, Tres bien. Et vous?" He would pretend he was talking to the Barcelona president. "'One moment. One moment please. Tres bien, tres bien." So when he leaves, Nelson pulls it out… It's a toy cell phone. [General chit-chat in Portuguese.] If you tell your friends any of this, they won't believe it. Everywhere he went there would be somebody to have a word with the coach… So he could have a chance to train. It was me who had a word with Carlos Alberto Torres "Professor, let Kaiser train." Other people too. I think he always had somebody who could help him out, but he knew he didn't have what it takes to be a professional footballer. When they say "Kaiser wasn't a good player." Kaiser wasn't a good player because… They're comparing me to the players I hung around with. If it was with today's generation, I'd be a star player. You understand? (light vibraphone music) [Narrator] The players Kaiser claims he hung around with were not ordinary footballers. They are some of the biggest stars Brazil has ever produced. Zico, Beberto, Junior, Romario. You'd have to be really good to stand out amongst those guys. (crowd cheering) One man did just that. His name wasn't Kaiser, though. It was Renato Portaluppi, a right-winger from Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. And because he was from the state famous for its cowboys he was known to all as Renato Gaucho. [MUSIC} William Onebeyor: "Fantastic man" [Washington Rodriguez] I'd define Renato Gaucho like this… Renato Gaucho was the perfect man. [Brazilian soccer comentary] [Ricardo Rocha] Renato had an illustrious career in Brazil. He's one of the greatest forwards in Brazilian football… Without a doubt. [Brazilian soccer commentary] [Be be to] Reanto was a top player. He was a player much like Cristiano Ronaldo… Messi, Neymar. [Zico] He'd be there working harder than everybody. He'd cover more distance than anyone on the pitch. [Brazilian soccer commentary] He played every game, and he always delivered. [Washington Rodriguez] He has the strength of a Gaucho… And the ginga of a Carioca. [Crowd Cheering] [Narrator] Renato made his name Gremlo, pretty much single-handedly taking them to the Copa Libertadores and then the World Club Cup. [Brazillian soccer commentary] [Jose Carlos Araujo] Renato's rise at Gremio was as a young heart-throb. [Introducing Renato Gaucho] He was almost like a soap opera star in that early period. He'd date women and go to nightclubs… He'd joke around. He was a real joker. Great for the group. I loved him. [Martha Esteves] I had a real dislike for him. Stuck up stud. I have a deep dislike for stuck-up ladies' men, for arrogant hot guys. They really piss me off. [fantastic man music] [Washington Rodriguez] Renato was always a lad in the good sense of the word. Relaxed, likeable, friendly, affable. But he was a ladies' man. [Renato] I send this flower to my love. I'll send one to my other love Carla. For Maria. Oh God. For my love, Carl in ha. Monica, you're amazing. I'd never forget you. Oh God. We did an interview on the beach… And he wore tiny, weeny little yellow speedos. He had a huge speedo collection… Because he lived in Ipanema and he went to the beach every day. After chatting for half an hour, we became friends. [Journalist] You always seem to be dating a different beautiful woman… Are you fickle? [Renato] They can choose to accept me how I am. [Gonçalves] One time in the middle of the famous Rio Sul shopping mall I saw a small crowd gathering with guys passing by me saying… "Renato Gaucho's over there signing autographs." And I thought "Is Renato there? I'll go and see." I get into the middle of the mall and who's there signing autographs? Kaiser! [Ricardo Rocha] He wanted to look like Renato Gaucho… He cut his hair the same way… And tried to wear similar clothes to Renato when he could. [Be be to Singer] He pretended to be Renato. He would show goal montages from afar… And because Kaiser had wavy hair like Renato… He would tell girls that he'd scored a goal for Gremio and girls bought it because they didn't have a lot of knowledge about players. My reign truly began from 1983 when I was compared to Renato. That's when my reign starts. Renato's clone. [Renato] I began visiting Rio de Janeiro in 1983… And it was around then I met this legend. We can call him that. All of you abroad may have only just heard of him… But for us here he's a legend. And then I started hearing all of these stories about me… And then I started hearing all of these stories about me… "This guy's slept with women pretending to be you. He's doing this or that." "This guy's slept with women pretending to be you. He's doing this or that." "He's doing well out of your name." I said "If the guy's doing well, let him." "Unless he's stealing or attacking somebody let him do it." Due to my resemblance with Renato. "I used to to sleep with older women..." For money… Because women wanted to bed Renato… But they paid to have sex with Kaiser. [Renato] When I met Kaiser I could really see how much he resembled me. After we met I could never forget him… Because he's a real character. There are endless stories about Kaiser. We've been good friends for many years… And I know we'll stay that way. [Kaiser] I don't drink because my mum was an alcoholic. I have an aversion to drink. For me nowadays, my dad, my brother, my friend, my everything… Is Renato Gaucho. (upbeat jazz music) [Narrator] By pretending to be Renato, Kaiser had tasted the life of a professional footballer. He had his entry into the game and he fully intended to exploit it. In Brazil, Kaiser is known as a 171, the penal code for scams and fraud. [Sergio Americo] As we say colloquially here in Brazil… "Every 171 is loveable." And Kaiser is no exception. [Zico] They're always bad. Always bad. Profiting from something they don't do. [Junior Negão] Kaiser is a good 171... He was shady in a good way. I think he's an affront to the profession of football. [Narrator] Kaiser knew that if he wanted to maintain his footballer lifestyle, he had to become one. And with his growing network of famous friends, he started getting introductions to professional clubs. But his first opportunity didn't come in Rio, but 9,000 kilometers away. [French accordion music] [Alexandre Couto] Ajaccio, or Corsica actually… The island, is very beautiful. Surrounded by the Mediterranean. [Kaiser] GFCA. Gazelec Football Club Ajaccio. I was taken by a Brazilian called Fabio Barros, Fabinho. I arrived and they had high expectations because I was Brazilian. The stadium was packed with fans. I climbed into the stands and gave flowers to the president's wife… Got the Corsican flag and kissed it. And so I didn't have to train I kicked all the balls out to the fans… And then there was no training. I got a standing ovation. Just because of that I could have stayed ten years without playing. [Alexandre Couto] There was a game, which I was watching from the stands. And right when they blew the whistle he made a crazy ten metre dash. At the end of the sprint he put his hand on his leg and fell on the ground. There was a French guy sat next to me who also played for the club and he said. "Alex, that guy never plays. I already knew that was going to happen" "I was actually surprised he didn't come off before the whistle blew." His relationship with the club couldn't have been worse. He didn't bother anybody, but the coach didn't like him. [Kaiser] My friends were the directors not the players. [Alexandre Couto] Corsica wants to be independent. So the violence there is really bad. It's mafia. Let's not beat around the bush. It's mafia. Mancini, an Italian, was vice-president. He had a special relationship with Mancini… As if he was his son. It was like a wing of protection around Kaiser. It was a kind of mafia thing. [Kaiser] There came a point when they said "He's not going to perform." "He's not going to perform but he's important to us." And he was loaned out, he didn't stay there. He was always going back to Brazil to play for Bangu. Loaned out to Bangu, America FC. [Narrator] In a country where he couldn't speak the language and was a complete unknown, Kaiser had conned his way into professional football. Having a foreign club on his resume gave him exactly what he needed back at home, a doorway into the world of Brazilian football. [Kaiser] The clubs I've been at probably won't admit it… Because I was a disappointment for them. But clubs screw so many people over… That somebody had to trick the clubs. They couldn't fire me. How do you explain that you signed some player who didn't work out? You can't sell them. You'll be devaluing all of your assets. All the teams I went to celebrated twice when I signed and the again when I left. You understand? The only exception to that was Bangu. [Superfantastico theme tune] [Narrator] This is the legendary Brazilian children's TV show, Balao Magico. It featured a clown, a flying balloon with an evil face, and what appears to be a dancing penis, which is stroking an egg. Balao Magico and its theme song, Super Fantastisco, were loved by millions, including this man, Castor de Andrade. Castor was a colorful character in Brazilian life. He was patron of the famous Moncidade's Samba School, which still competes in Rio Carnival. Castor was a man of the people, known throughout the entire country. Bravo! [Narrator] And he financed and controlled Bangu, a small club in the west zone of Rio. Whatever he wanted, happened. Offside! And Castor wanted the Bangu band to play Super Fantastico at every game. ♪ Super Fantastico ♪ [Romarinho] Everybody who played for Bangu under Doctor Castor… Was afraid of Doctor Castor. That's a fact. You couldn't not be. [Renato Prado] The left back for the 1970 national team, Marco Antonio… Was always injured and he couldn't play. Castor went to training where Marco Antonio was chatting away… He took his revolver out… BANG, he took a shot near Marco Antonio's foot. He jumped about two kilometres. "Look! You're fine! You can play tomorrow then." (light percussive music) [Narrator] Castor was a man that no one wanted to mess with. In the 1980s, he was considered to be the most dangerous crime boss in Brazil. [Romarinho] If the police stopped you in the street and you mentioned Doctor Castor… You would get off Scott-free. Castor de Andrade's name was very powerful. [Washington] I was a friend of his. I'm godfather to his daughter. Castor was charismatic, caring. He lived on the wrong side of the law… But all the powerful leaders around the country loved him. [Narrator] Castor was a bichiero, the head of an illegal lottery game called Jogo Do Bicho. You can still buy a ticket on every street corner in Brazil and it's tolerated because everybody plays it. Castor had been born into the game and had gone from owning a few lottery stores to becoming one of the richest and most influential people in the whole of Brazil. [Sergio Americo] Castor de Andrade was drowning in money. He could light cigars with $100 bills. [Martha Esteves] He was the boss. He assumed the power of the role. I would very often see players kiss his hand. That would actually happen. [Narrator] Crime bosses are passionate people. And what better to release passion than through football. Bangu and Castor were a perfect match. [Referee] I saw who ordered them to attack me… And it was the chairman, Castor de Andrade. [Castor] ran after the referee with a clear instruction saying… "Don't leave the pitch!" "Wait on the pitch for the police." And as I approached him shouting "Don't leave the pitch!" He might have thought I was trying to attack him, so he ran off. The footage shows the carnage, but I didn't see anything. [Jose Carlos Araujo] I remember saying to him "Hey, Castor..." He liked me a lot because I didn't ask for bribes. And he said to me "Garotinho, get this in your head..." "Only people that deserve it get killed." So I went out thinking "Whoa, only people that deserve it get killed!" How was I supposed to interpret that sentence? [Narrator] Castor's money brought in some of the greatest players in Brazil, including some of the 1970. World Cup winning squad and their superstar national team forward, called Maurino. The team went from nothing to narrowly missing out on becoming champions of Brazil in 1985. [Brazilian soccer commentary] Castor's money also brought him a not-so-great player. [Kaiser] I came from Ajaccio. I went from Corsica to Bangu. There's a newspaper headline saying "Bangu has its king." Who was that? Zizinho? No. Carlos Kaiser. From a sports newspaper back then. It's there for whoever wants to see it. [Marcello Henrique] I saw this newspaper headline "Bangu signs Kaiser." The name alone stands out. A name like Kaiser. "I want to see this guy play." [Ado] He became as important as Mauro Galvão, Marinho… And nobody today can explain why. Because he was as important as we were for the club. For doing nothing. He wasn't a player. [Marcello Henrique] I was a ball boy at Bangu. He would tell me from on the pitch "Go up to the stands..." "And get all the guys from the favela here to shout my name." "Then after the training I'll buy you a snack and a drink." I said "Leave it to me." Then I went up and got about 30 guys to shout... "Kaiser! Kaiser!" After that Castor would say "He's the man." [MUSIC] Pete Dunaway "Supermarket'" [Ado] he managed to fool the most dangerous man in Brazil. Tripping Castor up is like tripping up a tortoise. It's difficult, but it seems he did it. [Romarinho] We were afraid of Doctor Castor… But he loved Kaiser. [Ado] You'd got into Castor's room and Kaiser was always there… Playing, chatting and laughing loads. When we had to give an interview, Doctor Castor asked him to do it. And everybody was like "Doctor, why Kaiser?" He would just say "Kaiser is the man." [Kaiser] Doctor Castor always thought I was going to shine at some point. I organized everything. I was the team's PR manager. So when a director of the team decided to get rid of me… There were 30 people demanding that I stayed. [Ado] The good thing he brought to Bangu was that he filled the place up with girls. He would arrive in a van… With 15 or 20 women. He's amazing. I don't know where his talent comes from but it's good. [Kaiser] This documentary has to be based on the personal side, not the footballing one. I wasn't any kind of legend. I was a legend to other people. The players' legend, not the fans' one. No club has a statue of me. There's nothing. [Music] Marcos Valle "Estrellar" [Narrator] Rio de Janeiro is as seductive at night as it is by day. All of Brazil wants to party here and with his reputation as a superstar footballer, Kaiser was at the center of every party. To his teammates, he was the king of Rio nightlife. What he lacked in talent on the pitch, he more than made up for on the dance floor. [Alexandre Torres] He'd know where the coolest places were. The king of the party. [Valthino] He was always around footballers and among beautiful women. I always saw Kaiser with beautiful women. And famous women too. [Maurico] Kaiser would bring you along to a nightclub… Where there were women in a VIP area… Free drinks, free food. It was like he was an actor. [{MUSIC PLAYS] He would pretend to be someone special… So people would inexplicably give him special treatment. [Gonçalves] He would rock up with his footballer swagger… Then he'd go up to them and say "Hey, I'm a footballer..." And the girl would be like "Wow! A footballer?" [Guitierrez] He would go up to women and say "I'm a footballer. I want to dedicate my next goal to you on TV" [Leri] He invited me to go out with him… That's where the trouble started. I remember one time we went to a nightclub called Nuth over in Barra. Kaiser invited me and two girls to a nightclub opening. "Ok. Let's go." "You won't have to worry about anything as it's all on my tab and I know everybody there." Then he opened a door about this height to crawl through. Under the door and under all these pots and pans. He got me in through the kitchen. I come in and there's a fryer in front of me. We came out onto the roof and down a ladder then we were in the club. Then once we finally got in I realised that he'd just snuck us in like a rat. I said to him "Fucking hell Kaiser, I work" "I can just go to the front and pay the entrance fee. I don't need this shit!" I got in trouble at home with my wife… Because a lot of people would say to her… "Renato was in this place, Renato was drinking there, Renato was with a woman." And it wasn't me. I was at training camp. It was Kaiser. We arrived at a nightclub. He was walking in and was stopped by the bouncer. Kaiser said "Don't you know who I am?" "I'm Renato Gaucho." "Oh Renato! Come on in." Then the nightclub owner said "Hey Renato..." Come sit down here. You and Mauricio sit here. They're players." Then the real Renato comes along and the bouncer stops him. I say "The owner invited me along. I'm with a couple of friends." And the guy says "but who are you?" I said "I'm Renato Gaucho." The bouncer looks at me and says… "Do I look like an idiot?" Renato says "Are you crazy, mate?" And everybody else saying "It's Renato, mate." And the bouncer says "No way, Renato's already inside!" "Oh, really? Renato Gaucho is already inside?" I said "Could you do me one favour?" Which one is Renato Gaucho in there?" I come in and Carlos Kaiser is there at the table… Surrounded by beautiful women with drinks on the table. Then they found out it was Carlos Kaiser. Kaiser went and hid in the bathroom. What can I do with a guy like that? [light percussive music] [Narrator] Off the pitch, Kaiser was living the life of a star, and his fellow footballers loved him. But Castor de Andrade's patience was starting to wear thin. [Eduardo Oliveiri] Castor was so pissed off with him. One day Castor de Andrade and his people came and said… "Kaiser! If you don't train today right now, we're going to shoot you." He pressured me. Doctor Castor liked the way I was. He wanted to see my character on the pitch. You could never fool him. Men like that don't get fooled. Nobody scams Castor de Andrade. [Club music] [Renato] Bangu weren't getting good results so at some point they said… "We have to make Kaiser play." [Kaiser] I was partying at a nightclub here in Rio called Caligula. The Bangu coach Moises calls me. [phone ringng] [MUSIC Zapatta "A Mesa Santa"] So the guy finds me at four in the morning. And he tells me that Doctor Castor wants me on the bench the next day. I said "Come on man. You call me at four in the morning to play in the game?" He said "No. You just have to be on the bench. You're not going to play." So I'm arriving back at the hotel and the other players are just waking up. I was a ball boy. I was on the pitch. It seemed like a storm was gathering. Everybody was excited saying "Kaiser is going to make his debut." How can a footballer be thinking… "Oh hell, I'm going on the pitch. What am I going to do?" So they put him on the bench. The game is in full flow then Castor sends a message down saying "Put Kaiser on." "Send Kaiser on. Put the big guy up front so he scores." And he's terrified of coming on. They tell him to warm up and he thinks "I'm screwed. I'm screwed." "If the Doctor finds me out, I'm dead." I started to warm up and supporters were shouting… "Long haired faggot!" I thought "Now's my chance." So I jumped the fence. And he fights this fan. And I was sent off before coming on the pitch. Castor comes down to the dressing room ready to kill him. "Kaiser, for God's sake, the boss is going to kill you today." "What have you done? You're crazy." I was sitting down and thinking about what I could say. Then Doctor Castor comes in with his heavies. When he came up to me I said… "Doctor." "Before you speak I want to say something." "I can't tolerate fans saying bad things about you..." "You are incredible." "You're my father." "God took away my real father..." "Then he gave me you." "The fans out there were calling you a crook and a bum..." "That you're a criminal, you're a villain." "They were slandering you saying you were a drug baron..." "Doctor…." "My contract is up in a fortnight." "You'll be rid of me in a fortnight." No! Kaiser. You are my friend. Three more months on your contract. "You're my friend. Three more months on your contract!" "Put another six months on Kaiser's contract and double his pay." And the whole team was like "Fucking hell. How did you manage that?" He stayed for another three months suckling Castor's tit. (Rock Music) [Narrator] So, by impersonating superstars and sweet-talking gangster bosses, Kaiser proclaimed to be a footballer himself. Now it was time to do some serious self-promotion, appear in sporting and gossip columns and start to dominate, not just Bangu, but the entire city of Rio. (Music continues) There were friendships that Kaiser forged with certain journalists. Who he'd schmooze. He'd sell his story and the journalists believed it. There are loads of interviews with him with many journalists. He's done loads of TV shows. It's truly unbelievable. Actually this is how it goes I was sold to Ajaccio in Corsica. In French it's "Ajaccienne." Jairzinho, I was your lucky charm. I saw you come to Botafogo. What's up gang. It's not just any show today. It's a special show. You know why? Why? Because Renato's here. You're so hot right now. The important thing is to be happy. He sold the story of his life being a footballer. He inhabited the character… And he talked the talk. (upbeat percussive music) [Narrator] As Kaiser's fame spread, he was able to get into any football club he wanted. Trying to work out which club he was at any one time was impossible. He was everywhere. A few weeks here, a few months there. [Kaiser] Dates for me are something I want to forget. I didn't care about changing clubs all the time… When a manager told me I wasn't going to play, I was overjoyed. [Narrator] In order to maintain the life of a footballer, all Kaiser had to do was make sure he never set foot on a pitch, or went near a football. [Kaiser] A famous midfielder for Fluminense… Knocked some guy out in a nightclub and I took the blame. I saved the players' asses. [Edgar] He came to Palmeiras. He approached the guy who was marking him from the youth team… And asked "How much do you earn?" The guy told him so he said "I'll give you double that if you injure me." Training started and the guy slide tackled him and injured him. Then when his contract was ending they extended it. [Kaiser] I arrived at Puebla on a 3 year contract but I was sent on loan to America FC. And the club president came to me and said "Fuck man you never play!" "I have the note here and they've finally found what my problem is." "It's a dental issue." Pure lies. [Narrator] Many people will wonder why football clubs would fall for this. The first rule for any good business person is to check your employees' references. However, in some respects, Kaiser's references were very good. Okay, he couldn't deliver on the pitch, but he certainly delivered off it. And his particular skills were just what was needed at Botafogo. [MUSIC Sonizeira: "Bam Bam Bam"] [Narrator] Castor de Andrade's shady work history and controlling interest in Bangu wasn't a unique combination in 1980s Brazil. There were other bicheiros involved in Rio football. Emil Pinheiro was just like Castor de Andrade. An absurdly wealthy man. [Emil] Top players probably earn more than the President of Brazil. [Martha Esteves] Emil was more of a small time bicheiro, and Castor was big league. He wasn't volatile or short tempered like Castor. Doctor Emil was really funny. He was tiny. He was really short. And he wore a little wig that would occasionally fall out of place. They needed to launder money they'd earned illegally. And part of that money went into football. Legend has it that Pinheiro bought off linesmen and referees. [Narrator] Emil had wanted to be part of football for years and his old friend, Castor, helped him get the right introductions to Botafogo. The club hadn't won a thing since the '70s, but Emil's briefcases of cash and a favor from Castor changed all that. Despite being the bigger bichiero, Castor owed Emil a lot of money and rather than start an unnecessary turf war, he just let a lot of Bangu players join Emil's revolution in Boafogo. The result, a 1989 state's championship. (Brazilian Soccer commentary) [Mauricio] God had a purpose for me with that goal. I brought joy to millions of Botafogo fans. This title is for my aunt… And for my mum watching at home. Emil Pinheiro was crucial to that victory. I can now die peacefully. [Narrator] Having been patron of the club for only a year, winning the title meant instant success. For Emil... To an outsider, it was almost as if he had a secret weapon. Can I say what actually happened or will it be censored? Is this film for over 18s? Can I explain exactly what happened? Very well Emil Pinheiro wasn't around for the Viagra boom. (Bam Bam Bam music continues0. Being the age he was… Impotence was a reality. Sexual impotence. So at the time there was… A prosthetic surgical procedure. It was the hot topic. Doctor Emil's bionic penis. [Claudio Cafe] I took him to get that prosthetic implant… And it made him really happy. I'm sure he died happy. And I teased him saying "Doctor Emil you must be over the moon..." "Because I heard you have a new penis." And Emil would wear these kind of baggy trousers… So his thing was king of swaying. It looked like a piece of wood. We started to joke with him saying that he had a permanent erection. He would go away and I would say "Guys, I think Emil's penis is bent..." "Because he always returns from the bathroom cleaning his glasses." Emil made a point of showing it off. Botafogo had gone ten games without a win. Emil sat down at the table with the cameras watching. Since I was the most experienced, I came forward and said… "President..." "Botofogo haven't won in ten games." "What do you have to say about a crisis at Botafogo?" Emil drummed his fingers on the table, and in that hoarse voice of his said. "Sergio Americo" "I've looked in the drawer." "I've looked in the cupboards." "I've looked on the floor..." "And I couldn't find the Botafogo crisis that you're talking about." Then he grabbed his prosthetic penis and looked at me. "Sergio Americo..." "The Crisis is here!" (laughing) I can't take it. I swear to God. I actually think I saw his dick accidentally… Because he would wear these tight chinos… And he was always sat with his dick like this. I would say "Guys, that dick is wrong!" [Narrator] It's no good having a new penis if you haven't got anyone to use it with. It is here that Kaiser's unique skills as a professional footballer can be fully appreciated. [Kaiser] Emil Pinheiro had a prosthetic penis. I was always introducing him to women and I would say to him… "What do you have that makes all these women want to sleep with you?" And so he warmed to me. So long as I stayed tight with the President. I could stay at the club until he wanted me to leave. If you get a guy like that who knows how to talk… He would pull his pants down for him. He was that good. He would roll out a red carpet for him. As far as the fans were concerned he was a Botafogo player. He always hung out with the players… Was close with the directors. And Kaiser stayed for 5 years in Botafogo. [MUSIC William Onebeyor "Body and Soul"] 88, '89, '90, '91, '92... Five years. He was the class pimp. [Kaiser] If Pele scored 1000 goals… Renato and I scored 2000 with women. I can't name any players because they're married. But it was a non-stop slut bonanza. If you're in Rio de Janeiro, you can't trust the players at all… Because our culture is completely different. Here it's about samba, partying, women and football. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile, that's how it is. He travel led with us and he would always arrive at the hotels in Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte. And I only later found out why Kaiser travel led with the team. [Kaiser] My currency was what most people had difficulty getting hold of. I found out what you needed and would exploit that need. Your weak point. What you like. [Buffalo Gil] He had the whole Botafogo tracksuit… So when he got to the hotel he would say "I play for Botafogo." He would take 5 or 6 women… And put them up in the same hotel as the Botafogo team. So he puts them all on the fifth floor and we're on the sixth. You can't keep guard at midnight. You wouldn't sleep. [Kaiser] When the director said… "You have to be in bed by 10pm" we'd say "Great." Nobody complained at all. Nobody moaned. [Gil] hey just went down one floor… And the players would have their orgy. I found out about this many years later. If I'd known, I would have kicked them out of the hotel. He acted as a pimp. He earned money bringing women to the players. [Kaiser] Whatever women the guys wanted I would bring to them no problem. Whether it was for directors or players.. If you have money or women you're the man. [Gil] Emil knew about the whole situation… And he couldn't say anything because if it got out to the press it would become a global scandal. Because we knew that he arranged women for Emil. He's up with God now because he died a long time ago, but everybody knew that he supplied him. [Kaiser] My loan with Emil ended up getting renewed. All the time. It would end and he would renew it. It would end and he'd renew it. You've spoken to serious guys Alexandre Torres, Be be to all the rest played for Kaiser FC. I think KFC in the USA was named after me. Director, scout… Whoremonger he was everything imaginable, but he didn't play. I've slept with older women for money. When I was 20 and they were 45, 50, 60 I've slept with a 70 year old. With no Viagra. Smashing a pretty girl is easy. Try sleeping with a granny and getting her off. You've got to have talent. (moaning) (slapping.) Sex is my hobby. My dream as a little boy wasn't to go to Disneyland… It was to go to Amsterdam, the land of smut. What would I do? Go on the ghost train? Meet Mickey? That doesn't turn me on. I'd rather meet Mickey's wife. Minnie. If she's hot, I'll give her a squirt. My hobby is sex. I have a disease like they say Michael Douglas has. I'm super nice to people I date, but after three months... Big hug. See you later. They're doing a documentary on me… Interesting. These English guys came over to make a documentary about me… As a trainer and an ex-footballer. I'm not a teacher. I'm a personal trainer. So I'll get you looking like a Carnival Queen. I'm really keen. It's charisma. Women like attention from men. A lot of my students have ugly faces but great bodies… But you're really pretty. He gave them that. He was a sweet talker. He's an upbeat and extrovert guy. What woman doesn't like that? And if you've got ten friends you can bring them too. [Renato Mendes] He is like an illusionist. If you let him talk, he would very quickly make you believe his story. Going to Bulgaria, a woman costs as much as a coffee. He has enough stories to fill a book. A thick book. Oh parties… You know with the Italian Prime Minister lots of orgies. Kaiser has a lot of stories I think those stories create the legend. "I went to the Oscars after-party at Robert De Niro's house." He went out with Ivete Sangalo, they had dinner. His stories got players dreaming. I think that's why people liked him so much. (grand orchestral music) [Kaiser] When I arrived at Ajaccio... He would always talk about Ajaccio. It was my first week in Corsica... They gave me a girl as a present. When I got to El Paso... (Gun firing) They gave me a beautiful blonde prostitute as a present. "I had played such a good game..." "The chairman sent for me and said..." "Here's my Ferrari..." "And my secretary." "Beautiful, beautiful..." "A beautiful blonde." And the younger players who didn't know him all ears waiting for what he was going to say. "What's it like driving a Ferrari?" "I'll tell you later." If I'm not mistaken… She acted in a famous French soap. With Kaiser, I don't know when he's telling the truth. I couldn't communicate with her. If you tell the same lie four times… It becomes the truth. "So I drove up to the mountains..." We went from motel to motel… [Be be to] He was engrossed in his own stories… That you'd feel bad calling him out… "No Kaiser, you're lying mate." "You're lying." [Kaiser] We managed to get in somewhere… And I paid upfront. "She was loving it..." "And I was wanting to seal the deal..." She signal led that she couldn't fuck me because she was on her period. "On the rag." I remember exactly how he said it… "On the rag." "We can't play today because the pitch is waterlogged." And the lads were like "Oh what an anti-climax." So I mimed to her... So I tell her that as I'm such a good sportsman… That as I'm such a good sportsman… "When the pitch is wet I can shoot from behind the goal." "When the pitch is wet I can shoot from behind the goal." [MUSIC] French national anthem. The lads couldn't contain themselves. Everyone cheering like it was a goal. How are you going to translate that? That definately didn't happen. [MUSIC] Bezerra da Silva "Malandradgem da um tempo" [Narrator] A good story is a powerful tool, especially if it's told convincingly to a young starstruck fan who wants to become the girlfriend of the famous Carlos Kaiser. [Valeria] He isn't Kaiser to me… He is Carlos Henrique to me. I think I'm the only person who calls him 'Carlos'. Back then he was a Vasco player. It's incredible. I never saw Carlos train, I never saw Carlos play… Unless it was on video. And I think it was Vasco vs Botafogo. He came on from the bench, dribbled… And scored an amazing goal. [Commentator] Goal for Vasco. Take another look at that great skill by Henrique! Perfect run… Followed by a clinical finish. 1-0 to Vasco. [Dror Niv] He always said that he was a centre half. He would say that he scored a winning goal for Vasco. They had a centre half called Henrique… And since he is called Carlos Henrique it might have been him. [Alexandre Couto] There was another Henrique who played for Vasco and looked a lot like him. He had the same physique as him. He gave me a VHS tape and I think I still have that tape. I can show it to you but it's priceless because not even he has it anymore. [Interviewer] Don't take this the wrong way… But are you sure it was actually him scoring the goal? Yes. I'm sure. How do you mean? I didn't get the question. He had a DVD of his highlights. I don't know how. He never showed me but he told me that there are goals of his on it. I don't understand. I don't know if he put his head on somebody else's body. [Narrator] Pretending to be a Vasco player is relatively easy. Actually becoming one is another thing entirely. Especially at a time when Vasco's players made up a large part of the national side. [Be be to] He was at Vasco with me too. Same kind of faking. I already knew Kaiser from the Flamengo days. But I didn't say anything. When he came there I didn't say anything. He turned up at Vasco with another player who he was friends with. We began a friendship with him… And we started to encourage him to work and train at Vasco something which never happened because he was always injured. (light orchestral music) [Narrator] After six month's of Kaiser's injuries, Vasco had exhausted all the traditional methods of treatment. Was divine intervention. The black magic priest Pai Santana… Performed rituals on me so my bruises would heal. Because we wanted to get him on the pitch… We would ask Pai Santana to call upon the Gods… To get Kaiser to train. Pai Santana had all his spells. And he went to work on him there. I already knew he was faking it. [Kaiser] I went up to him and said "Take your money, mate." "There's nothing wrong with me. Take your money and don't bother doing your thing" "I intend to stay injured for the rest of my life." That was such a funny day. [Narrator] Pai Santana had failed. Kaiser had even managed to defeat the gods. But he was now a Vasco player and he wanted to let everyone know. Not on the pitch of course, but on Brazil's biggest football analysis program, Mesa Redonda, broadcast to millions every Sunday night. This was prime time television. Only the best would appear on this show. I spent 14 years on that times lot. At the table during Mesa Redonda there were a lot of guests. The big players like Romario, Edmundo, Renato… They never refused to come on. So Carlos Kaiser is a footballer. He had a stint at Vasco… And he's still contracted to a club in Corsica. So I don't remember that character. Do you have a video? I'd been at Ajaccio for two seasons but I wanted to come back here. That's when I came to Vasco. I researched him. He said he played for Flamengo. How would I not have heard of him if he'd played for Flamengo? So we finally found a place, and she turned to me and said… She was in that period. It's so sad that period that girls go through. There's a term that football commentators use which is… "A player the fans don't notice." Kaiser was never noticed by the fans. "When the pitch is wet I can shoot from behind the goal." Nowadays if a proposal like that came to us… We'd go on Google and investigate. (speaking Portuguese) [Music] Got an Project - Vuelvo Al Sur. We're at the Clube dos Macacos in Horto… In the south zone of Rio de Janeiro. And it's a very famous club where people come to play football at the weekend. Not that many people come here… But it was somewhere Kaiser used to come a lot. When I went to France in 1986 I came back for the holidays. My brother was living in my apartment and was good friends with Kaiser… And he started to get close to me… And asked if I had a souvenir from Ajaccio like a shirt or a card… Something that he could relate to football. Then we became friends and went to nightclubs... And he started saying that he was an Ajaccio player with me. And it was right where he took those photos as if he were training at Ajaccio. You can see in those photos that it's exactly this same pitch. Some things have changed but it's mostly the same with all the trees. Anybody in the industry would know that it was a fake. First of all, he's wearing a match shirt. A training shirt isn't for a match. You're not going to train with a match shirt. Obviously a professional footballer would look at the pictures.. And just see him in the photo. It looks kind of weird because at training you usually have loads of players around. All the little tricks and mannerisms the professional players had… He was already using. Let's imagine that he was studying for a degree. He would have nailed the theory side of being a footballer. Really funny. Him calling for the ball. Pass the fucking ball! From now on I would rather tell the complete truth. Kaiser never set foot in Ajaccio, not in the city or the airport. (city sounds) (tapping) After the first few recordings we did… He called me the following day and asked if you guys… Had actually come and done an interview with me. I told him I had and that I'd told the truth. I have my own reputation to think about I worked and lived there for five years, and I can't tarnish my name to promote Carlos Kaiser's lie. He got really pissed off and didn't call me again. He denies it now so if he doesn't admit that fact. I'm not going to be the one to… Dispute that. Dispute that. Everybody knows. Everybody knows. I was taken by a Brazilian called Fabio Barros, Fabinho. It was a Brazilian that recommended me. Whom I don't even feel like naming anymore. He recommended me he oversaw the deal, and I ended up going to Corsica. To Ajaccio. [dramatic French music] [Fabinho] I let him live out his fantasy here in Rio, but to say that he was there is too much. I can't. But I think he still has it stuck in his head. He still believes it. [Kaiser] When it came to getting the chance to appear alongside the best players of the era… He wanted that. [Carlos Alberto] This is Kaiser speaking. From Rio de Janeiro. (laughing) If he didn't want to talk about Ajaccio he should just say so "I don't want to talk about that." And that would be that. I think Corsica is one of the most beautiful places on earth. He would ask me what life was like in Corsica… What the diet was like. What the climate was like, what the club's situation was. [Kaiser] I respect and admire Corsica. I think Corsicans… Are amazing. An oppressed people. He could eventually use that information… In sporting interviews that he might give. I was sold to Ajaccio in Corsica. In French it's 'Ajaccienne' I have nothing to say about Corsica and Ajaccio. It's a historical city. An innately tough people. A people that were born fighting for their values. Ajaccio has nothing. Ajaccio is a dead island. Speaking about Corsica is difficult. "How do they speak there?" Comment ca-va? Tu va bien? Comment ca-va? Tu va bien? "Je t'aime. I love you." Which was the phrase he'd use with the ladies. "Je t'aime." Speaking about Corsica is… A double edged sword. The moment he asked for the card I knew what it was for… He'd already told me... "That card is one of the most important documents I have in my wallet." He knew that was like a status symbol. It was like having a footballing contract. He knew that in Corsica and in the south of France… There was an Italian influence from the Corsican Mafia. I can't talk about the Corsicans… Because they'll send somebody to assassinate me. So he made up that Mancini was part of the Corsican mafia. That's all made up. That's not true. That's a story created in his head. It's a team that always fought. A team that even in defeat the players would give everything to win. I think Corsica… Is another world. Understood? [Fabinho] I can guarantee you that he benefited a lot more than I did… From having played in Corsica. I didn't get onto the programmes he did in Rio, or go to the places where he went. And then he gave one of the most famous commentators in Brazil the Ajaccio shirt which I'd given to him as a present. You could even say he was the Fabinho here in Brazil that I never was. [Kaiser] It's difficult. You can't understand humans. I took part in this documentary to tell the truth. This is a documentary about the truth. If you want to talk about a genuine person I'll talk about Alexandre Couto. "Alex, that guy never plays. I already knew that was going to happen..." Everything Alexandre says is true. He speaks the truth. He's not two-faced. It was like a wing of protection around Kaiser. It's authentic. Alexandre is genuine. He's not two-faced. [Interviewer] Was kaiser ever at Ajaccio? Never. He never played for Ajaccio. [Fabinho] I did have a conversation with Alexandre after the first interview he did… When he said that you guys wanted to speak with me. And I said "Alexandre, there's only one way I'm doing that interview." "Me telling the truth as far as I know it." "I'm not going to be saying things that really didn't happen there." Every player knows that story is a lie. Especially because they know my story and Fabinho's story. So they all know he was never at Ajaccio. I love Kaiser to bits. That's the truth. He became a great friend for many years. And we've always gone out of our way to indulge his fantasy. And we've always gone out of our way to indulge his fantasy. He lives off that because his daily bread are these football stories. He lives off that because his daily bread are these football stories. He lives off that. So we sometimes play along with his fantasy... Kaiser is a football fan. He wanted to be a footballer his whole life. And there comes a time when people have to tell the truth. What's true and what isn't. What he did and didn't do. - [Interviewer] Kaiser. - Are you a proud man? No. If I was proud. I wouldn't be showing the world my reality which is very different from when I was in football. I'm very damaged. I'm a very damaged person. That's maybe why I've lived other people's lives so much of the players. It was so I didn't have to stop and think about my life. Because if I stopped to think about my life. I think I would have done something stupid. When I was ten my dream was to play football. But I wanted to be a footballer to make money for myself… To get out of the dump that I lived in. There was so much adversity and so much back-stabbing. You either become a scammer or a sucker. My adoptive mum was an alcoholic. She died of cirrhosis and she weighed 200 kilos. And then I was left with two elderly aunts… Very old who were… Who were cleaning ladies. (crying) So then I had to take football a bit more seriously to bring money home… So those two women wouldn't suffer. Then all of a sudden a girl tells me she's pregnant… And my son was born even without living with me. I didn't give my son any love. I don't think I deserve to be anybody's father. I don't deserve to be anybody's son or father. I tried to be a normal guy. I tried to get married. I tried to have a family life. Something I didn't have when I was young. And then my son dies. Then I get married and my wife dies. I get married to another woman and she dies. I wake up one day with no sight in one eye. Fuck. In Buddhism they would say… That I lost my vision in order to see the world a different way. People have an image that's completely… Different from the reality. Carlos Henrique is a man. Carlos Kaiser is a character. Carlos Kaiser only exists because Renato Gaucho exists. My mum didn't do a third of what that guy did for me. And he doesn't do anything anymore because. I hide myself away. Like I was hiding from the producers of this documentary. [Music] Elza Soares: "Comigo" [Renato] Whenever I can I help Kaiser out… He knows that and there's no ulterior motive. There are things that I would avoid talking about with him, for example his son, because I didn't want to dwell on the subject. Him having that photo at home doesn't surprise me at all being the kind of person he is. It's a recognition of the family that he didn't have. That flatters me. That makes me happy and very moved. It's actually difficult to explain it, to talk about. Because not everybody says "You're more important than my family." I live one day at time. Today you've managed to strip me down. Yesterday I was really pissed off because… Somebody I thought was a friend denied something. Fine. Everybody has their own fears. I have mine too. I can't be criticized… Or the friendships I had. Something good had to come my way. I could have exploited the opportunities. I didn't harm anybody. There's not one person. You've interviewed between 20 to 30 people not one has said that I'm a bad guy, that I'm a drug addict, or that I went into their house and stole. I never took anything away from anybody. Life stole from me. I started by losing my mother. Now people think I took this and that. To take such a beating. I didn't take anything from anybody. I rode my luck. I didn't take anything. That's all I took. I took my luck. Nothing from anybody. They took something important away from me. They took my mother away. They took away the woman I married. They took my son away. I don't make anybody answer for that. I don't make God answer for it. I don't ask my friends to answer for it. Fuck! Why do I have to suffer so much? That Carlos Kaiser who went out to the best places… That guy was built on strong legs. Because Carlos Henrique jumped over a lot of hurdles. Lots. I want success for those people who believed… In my story. And that my story serves as a positive example, not a negative one. For the world. But if you intend to talk… Tell the truth from beginning to end. I intended that, so I'm here ready to be judged. Which is difficult. It's almost 13 years since this story ended. And it's only come out now. Never. Not one reporter or player or director. It goes to show how much these guys respect me… That nobody ever put me away. Now these stories have come to light. I swear on my eyes… Easily 1000 women. You know today is the hardest day to do this. Today was the toughest day of the documentary. It was the day of talking about my suffering. But that's ok. If the world has to look into my eyes… Here it is. (light guitar music) [Junior] It was like a fairytale. You take a character and let him live in the football world. And what I think is great, is that people didn't crush the guy's dream. [Mauricio] A fantastic character who there are ano words to describe. He's part of my whole life story. And he has a black brother here. Just a moment please. I didn't know he was having problems. (group vocalizing) [Renato] Carlos Kaiser is unique. He's unique. He always has been and always will be unique. Nobody will come close to him. He was the greatest footballer never to have played football. In history, without a doubt. Unbeatable.
