That was the municipal pound cart. Finding this photo made me want to talk about Algeria. It's unbelievable. I'm thirty years old, and it's still hard to talk about. Maybe because of my parents. It's true, my mother wouldn't like me telling our story. But my life began there so... Tadjira (Algeria) June 1945 Tadjira wasn't a big city like Constantine or Algiers. Just a sub-prefecture. We lived in Rue Diderot, near the post office. Now I think about it my life got off to a bad start. My father wasn't there when I was born. He was fighting in Italy. But in 1945, when he was demobilized, with the Monsabert infantrymen, the first thing he did, before taking off his uniform, was reopen the grocery store. He climbed his ladder, and with a brush, he made an important change. Here's the bonny baby! Look at him! He's so sweet! What's his name? Paul. Smile at Mrs Benichou and Uncle Jacob. Give me a smile, Paulo! He's so graceful. Just like his dad! Albert, what did you do in Italy? Fight or chase the girls? - Why do you say that? - How many kids do you have? Just the one. My oldest. Then why write "sons"? October 1949 Pretty fast, huh? Four already. School for the first time. And a last glance at the free world. At school, I was stuck. I didn't understand the letters. The others were already reading. Any other mother would've been dead ashamed. Not mine though. She said... Poor thing, he has few resources. Anyway... when I understood it wasn't temporary, I got used to it. And at school, I met my best friend. Georgeo Labrouche, a settlers' son. Dad was none too pleased. He'd say, "Sonny, "settlers and grocers should not mix" November 1954 They went too far. It was bound to happen. You can't count on Mendès France! There's the truth: "Terrorists attacks... and Algeria remains healthy." That's a load of crap! Franco, I wanted a word. The goal I scored Sunday is being challenged? Don't talk about that goal! I had two seconds. I took the pass and bam, I headed home! What'd you say? If the goalie hadn't been peeing, you wouldn't have scored. There's always a reason! Jacob! Why's he leaving? Jacob Gavalda, was my dad's best friend, except when he talked politics. For a living, he ran a small candle factory. On Thursday afternoons, I liked staying with him to work. Apart from his worker Brahim, we Jacob's only family. Uncle Jacob was fantastic. He was always inventing things. Tadjira's Descartes. Have you seen the paper? Eight dead, several wounded, two teachers murdered. Just for All Souls' Day. Paulo, son, mark my words. one day, we'll all leave here penniless. That's right, mate. Make bigger candles! That's it. It's over. I'll leave the door open, darling. Sleep tight now. The boy can't sleep. It's Jacob and his gloomy ideas. You know what he told him? One day, we'll all leave here like tramps. The boy can't sleep now. He's such a sensitive boy. The fight is about to commence. May 1958 Carasco... Adja... Adjazmoufa. Nakam Nardoche, and Georgeo Labrouche have obtained their School Certificate by order of merit. The best first. And after the jury's special and very, very deliberation, Paul Narboni. You? I don't believe it! Come on, Paulo! You're not lying, are you? Here's half a pound. My son got his certificate. Marguerite! The boy! The boy got his certificate. My son! My boy has passed his School Certificate! You passed? He passed. I don't believe it! What does your son want to do now? I don't know. It's become too hard for him at school now, so... He'll carry on studying, won't he? Don't you get it? He's only just passed his School Certificate, poor boy, and you're making plans for him! You have to plan, my girl. You got it wrong again. So what? No one cares. They come out of patriotism, not for the concert. Look. Here, like in Algiers, united, Arabs, French, hand in hand, brothers! The shit's over for us. Your fingers are wrong. You'll see what your de Gaulle does. May 1958? We'll cry tears of blood. He said, "French Algeria" didn't he? We heard him. - He'll say we misheard. - You... Gentlemen. April 1961 This is France 5. Honour and homeland. This is the Committee for National Redress. French of Algeria, this morning, in Algiers, the army took control of the situation. The policy of abandonment conducted in Paris, by Charles de Gaulle, was leading to the loss of a cherished land. I told you so. Sétif 1945. November 1954. 1958... And now the putsch. So? The punch is good for us. Good? One day we'll all leave completely penniless. What can I do, Mrs Narboni? I can't tie his wrists at night. He stains the sheets. Poor Leila scrubbed in vain. - It's impossible to get out. - I've noticed nothing with mine. But he stays ages in the WC. His dad gets annoyed waiting by the door. - Isn't he tired? - I don't know how he manages. School is too hard for him. It's true! With Greek, Latin, English and German too! That just leaves Arabic! The Suzi with the tuna. The harissa keeps falling off. - What's that? - Detergent. Write it down. Well! Look at him. Why did he have to move in opposite? That's Captain Arion. He was sent after the putsch to restore law and order. As if after 7 years of war, the army could change things. On Sundays, I had lunch at my pal Georgeo's. The Labrouches' farm was known as "the chateau". The area's most fortified property, and the most well guarded. The guy at the wheel, who has no licence, is Georgeo Labrouche. That's me next to him. We got so bored on Sundays in Tadjira. You could either go to The Rialto or Café Franco. That was it. And when there really wasn't anything else to do, we'd go to the parish club. Supposedly to chat up the girls. The girls of Tadjira. Hold the door, OK? Hot, isn't it? Have you seen how I jive? What about you? Véronique Arion, the captain's daughter. She was so pretty with her ribbons. Better than our girls. You live opposite, don't you? - You've noticed me? - Maybe. You boys should stand at your window, tonight, at 10pm. Go on, Labrouche, the biscuits are all yours. I have to go. It's the curfew. Wait. She said 10. What's that? That's a 12.7. It spits. Dad bought one for the farm. Do you reckon she'll take off her panties? Shut up and watch. Talk later. There you are, my two musketeers! All this guarding is driving me nuts! Why close the window? With this heat... Take off my shoes. I'll take you home. Marguerite! We're guarding the dam. Near Georgeo's dad's farm. - Take him with you. - I said I would. There's a snack for Jacob too. And black olives. - Where's my gun? - Here. The kids have played with it. Paulo, did you play with it? See what you've done! Allow me. Let's go! Café Franco had been blown up while the old men were playing cards. Why throw a grenade in my store? Why pick on me? You've ruined me, killed me! There 50 cafes on this square. And you have to choose mine! Couldn't you have gone somewhere else? He's too much, Franco. The Arab was just delivering Coca-Cola. Unbelievable! Why was the raghead there when the attack occurred? I'm telling you, the paras were nice to him. At the farm, we'd have killed him. Two 11.43 bullets right here. At the farm! Who shoots? Your dad or you? Johnny! Bring me the nails! The king of rock. Albert, lunch is ready. Come up! Coming. Take the hammer and nails. Put up the mesh to keep out the grenades. Don't go eating biscuits behind my back Don't put it everywhere. Leave a space for the customers. OK, boss. Did you hear? They killed Duval, the local jeweller. Not the son. His father, the old man. As he was closing the store, they pounced on him. How old was Duval? At least 70. Even so... Poor old man. They're killing old men now! Aren't you going to eat? Put that thing down! It's bad news for us. You know who's in goal? Mederli. The Flying Oran Man. The Notre Dame vs Gallia Club match was an annual event. It was worse than a war of religion. The Arabs of Gallia wore green and white the other side was French, that's to say us. I remember that day well. I was replacing Atlan. What's Paulo doing? We were none too proud. 1 - 0. The Arabs scored with just a minute to go. And Stefanov pushed Djelali in the penalty area. With a penalty kick, we were bound to score. When Franco took the ball and ran the other way, we all figured the attack on his cafe had driven him mad. What's he doing? He went up to Mederli and put the ball on the Arabs' penalty spot. You know what? Even though it was unfair, we kept quiet. 1 - 1, we saved face. Thanks, Franco! The retaliation was swift. For a week, the OAS took care of us by dynamiting night and day. Can't they let us sleep? Just for one night. They've blown up the streetlamp. Albert! Why did they do that? It's just gelignite. - Sleep. - You're sweet. Cuddle up. Pathé News Algeria. Peace at long last. Common sense has prevailed. Following the referendum where France heeded de Gaulle's call for self-determination, Algeria is to gain independence. The Hour of Independence 8 years of war and 1 million dead for this French department to break away from France. But 130 years of our presence do not vanish overnight. In Oran, and all over the country, it's the OAS' scorched earth policy. In the streets, cars and furniture are being destroyed. Dramatic scenes of the exodus. No one believes in the Evian Accords. This is the result of the terrible slogan, Leave or Die. July 1962 Long live the FLN For sale My dad refused to believe it. Don't put the Suzi with the tins of harissa. Put the cassoulet next to the beans. Mum. Wipe the tins. They can at least be clean. Not next to the Suzi! How many times must I tell you? Where should they go? On the right. Stack them. They're already stacked. There's no room. Next to the Suzi then. Sir? What does he want? What are you doing behind my counter? I've come to buy the store. Who says I'm selling? What else can you do? I'm not selling. 500,000 francs. My store, with the stock, is worth 10 million. I'm not selling it for 500,000! You've got to be joking! Sir... Once the army leaves, you won't be the boss anymore. And you won't have a franc to your name. What's best for you? That I sell. 4 millions, not a penny less. 500,000 francs. We don't eat pork. It makes a difference. 2 million. This is all my savings. I'll give you the lot. 500,000 francs. This would feed my kids for 10 years. Your children? It will take them 20 years to eat all the stock! We're leaving. I hope we've got everything. In Marseille, a cab to the station then Paris. Why do you want to go so far north? The sun never shines there. Why go to Paris? That's where the money is. As well as my friend General Bauvergne. Just trust me. When we get to Marseille, a cab to the station then up to Paris. Are you sad? In Marseille, a cab to the station then up to Paris. Marseille 17 July 1962 Marseille, from afar, reminded us of home. The church on the hill was like Santa Cruz in Oran, or Notre Dame in Algiers. We thought the boat had turned back in the night. Believe me if you like, when we got to Marseille, we took a cab to the station then headed to Paris. Paris, 2nd class. Three singles. Go on, Albert, ask him. Why won't you ask? Is there a reduction for the repatriated? A reduction? I don't do reductions! 26 months defending your farms. Why didn't you stay there? The country's overpopulated. The French are jobless. No one gives a toss about you! So there isn't a reduction? Not enough jobs for the French! Where are you from? Me? Know it? Near Oran. I don't know it. Soon he'll be teaching us the map of Algeria. Know where we're from? Tadjira. Tadjira is very pretty. They have a great football team. What about Notre Dame? The Couares, Jasseron, Delval, Kamarata. Stefanov, the Tadjira gunner. Come on. Tadjira is very pretty. Why did you all leave? Why did we leave? He's asking why! Because we had to. We had to leave! Don't speak that way. Who wanted independence? You did! You lot wanted independence. Now listen up! Go back to where you came from. End of story! You see, my family's over there, but my work is here. And us? Everything was there. Everything was there! There it is. Here's your tip. It's OK. Do you have children? - I have 8. - Take it then. Buy them some food. What'll become of them now we're gone? The platform's deserted. Sure it isn't a siding? Your dad always arrives hours in advance! Coming! What does she want? Paulo, sleep! Put your legs up. Sorry, it's full. Maybe next door. I understand you'd rather be alone as a family after your ordeal. But allow me to insist. I'm Nicole Guyon. I'm here to assist you in every way possible. If it's to give us another Red Cross blanket like when we arrived... Why no! We're a handful of volunteers to help you in your efforts. To combat the selfishness of many of our compatriots They don't care, it's the holidays. What we want is to find a home and work. Listen, here's the address of hotel. Say I sent you. There'll be a room. - Mrs Guyon? - Nicole Guyon. This is for you. No need to thank me. That's for the boy. Here, Paulo. I must dash! I've a train for Nîmes in 5 minutes. Good luck! Paulo, come see. Look carefully. We change trains at Concorde. Then go to Abbesses. We're here. The Gare de Lyon. We're here. What? The metro stop is the Gare de Lyon. We're not beggars! We've lost everything, but we don't want charity. We don't want anything! Bloody... Bloody bastards! Yes, all of you! All you French. - What's going on? - Nothing. They're ragheads. He gave me money! Don't you see? He took me for a beggar. Mum, stop. And you, of course, didn't defend me. You said nothing. You don't care if your wife is insulted. Marguerite, he was wrong. Just stop going on about it. - Besides, he apologized. - He apologized? - He said sorry? - Yes. So anyone can insult me, as long as they apologize. My God! Humiliated. I'm humiliated. What did I do to deserve this? My heart is like a broken alarm clock. I can't take anymore. This is it. Albert Narboni. How much is it? 1, 000 francs. You pay up front. Room 19. 2nd floor? Yes, the 2nd. He follows us everywhere like a bad smell. We use corporation tax to massively fund research, education, health, agriculture. We build 100s of 1000s of new homes every year. Right... Tomorrow, General Bauvergne. Up at 7am. I have to iron your clean shirt. Your mum's sweet. She thinks of everything. In my grave too, when the worms eat me. Hey, Dad! Do we have to live in a hotel like this? We brought money with us. You're so smart, son! What will we do if we don't find a job? Go to the Salvation Army? He treated me like a tramp. And you didn't defend me. Marguerite, sleep. He's a bit odd but very kind. Mr Narboni. What a surprise! How have you been? We're doing OK. The general asked me to bring the youngster Paulo, my son. He's not used to wearing a tie. Can't he tie it himself? I'll show him how if he doesn't mind my touching. You have visitors. General! You have visitors. Oh, Simoni! Welcome to HQ. You've brought the child! Thank you, Simoni. Stop that bloody racket! My regards, sir. Say, "My regards." - My regards. - He's deaf. My regards, sir. Regards! Sit. At ease, friends. At ease. Young Simoni. You'll have a drink, Simoni! No thank you, sir. - Thanks! - Martini? Guylaine, a drink for these men. Well? Anything to report? Report, Simoni. Any news? Nothing, sir. Unfortunately. Here are your drinks. The ice is here. I won't leave the bottle because with him... And don't forget your drops. Down in one! Down in one, like in the good old days. Dad, who's Simoni? I'll explain later. What are you going to tell him? Everything you've done. Money? They won't cough up easily. But you have to request a loan. It'll be a priority. And you'll have a job. I've written to the minister. The bastard owes me. Since Vichy... God, here we go again! - Is he dead? - Just old. It's his circulation. The blood isn't going to his head... Miss Guylaine? Hold his head. He's got his thing! How many drops again? Five. Ten. Who's Simoni? An adjutant with us in Italy. A so-called hero. As long as he gives your dad work, he can call me whatever he likes. Drink, sir. Let go of his head. Drink. Simoni. - Drink, sir. - Simoni. I have to stay calm. Or I wet myself. Fall out, Simoni. Help him. This boy needs toughening up, Simoni. Do you hear? An NCO, like his father. Come back soon with your dad, alright? Goodbye, Guylaine. - Let's drink to the good news. - What good news? What good news? Look behind you. Have you seen those legs? Enjoy the sight. I want to buy a paper. Damn fine son I have! This week's Confidences. - Here. - And this, please. This? Paris Flirt? 3.50 francs. Goodbye, young man. And what was in the basket? Money! There's my boy now. Paulo! Come here. Say hello to the gentleman. - Mister? - Bonheur. Lucien Bonheur. Albert Narboni. Now where was I? - The basket full of money. - That's it! Sit with us, you'll be more comfy. I don't want to bother you. Back home, in Algeria, we were very informal. In that case... But only for 5 minutes. I have an appointment nearby. He had 500,000 francs in small change... 500,000 francs? I'll stop you there... He's stopping me! Hear that? Tell me... You were told nothing here? It was all kept quiet? I mean, to go that far... They went that far, sir. And even further. What a disgrace! You must be joking. It was a bloody mess, sir. A right bloody mess. Well... It's a thing of the past now, thank God. Hot, isn't it? I could drink another beer. How about you? A coke, son? Waiter! Two beers. - It's on me. - Well, if you insist. Believe me, sir, it was tough. So Lucien, tomorrow, same time, same place? I can't promise. Five minutes! So we can chat a bit. I'll tell you what it was like. Alright then, Albert. - I'll change my schedule. - You do that! Don't forget, business is important but so are friends. I won't keep you. Goodbye, Lucien. See you tomorrow. I made a friend today. - Listen to me. - I am listening. - What did I say? - You made a friend. A Frenchman or one of our kind? A Frenchman, but he's a good guy. He has a way with words. Huh? Yes. I was so lost in this city, in this shitty country. It cheered me up. I was feeling down too. I didn't know how to talk to kids my age. French girls scared me. I hung around outside rather than at the hotel, where all Mum did was cry. I was all alone in Paris. Mr Georges Labrouche Repatriated from Algeria to Marseille Or in the South of France - I don't have anything. - Ronda. I've won! Things are bad in Algeria. Things are bad. That's what the papers say. What do they say? Ben Bella won't last much longer. Nothing's working. The people aren't happy. They want us back. They have even had floods. Do you think it'll happen? Do you think we can go back home? I'm telling you, if we go back there, they had better roll out the red carpet. Put the king of spades there. Just let us play. Play. Diamond. Missa. Put down the 3. Hello, Mr Narboni. He's expecting you. Lucien! My dear chap! Marguerite! Mum! Are you in there! Yes. Coming. You'll never guess. What's that smell? - You've found work! - How did you guess? She's amazing. The first time I asked her out, she knew we'd have a son called Paulo. Silly thing! Not in front of him. The minister got Dad a job. In a grocery store! I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's celebrate! Get dressed. I am dressed. Suit and tie! Don't go wasting money. Get dressed up too. I've a surprise. You've not invited Lucien? Why not? He's my friend. You're mad! Just look at me! 3 months without a haircut. People will take pity on me. What will he think of me? He won't even look at you, he doesn't care. You'll see, you'll be... Marguerite. You're beautiful. Mum's a good dancer. She'll be stiff tomorrow. Bonheur dances well too. He looks like a clown. Go dance with her if you're so good. Want a kick up the backside? Tell your mum to stop showing off her derriere. Doesn't she realize? What a circus! My dear Marguerite, you're an extraordinary dancer. Albert, your wife is a real Ginger Rogers. She's a natural. You must have palpitations. We'll go home, darling. You'll be able to sleep. My wife is tired. So am I. I'm tired, am I? Mr Bonheur? A phone call for you. Mr Ruppert. Sorry. I won't be long - He's tireless, that Lucien. - Tireless? He must be spitting blood on the telephone. He dances well though. Caught your eye, has he? Good grief, he's jealous. Look, Albert. You wanted us to go out with him. I wasn't interested. I'm having fun for once in this country. Don't you spoil my evening! I didn't upset you, did I? Mr Pomonat, please. Stoprix on Rue Lepic. Thank you. - Bye, Dad. - Where are you going? - To buy a record. - Spend, spend, spend! Mr Pomonat? Albert Narboni here. Fruit and veg section manager. You forgot my courgettes this morning. It was an oversight? It must have been that, yes. Of course. Thank you, Mr Pomonat. Paulo, want me to introduce you? - You're hovering. - Stop it, Dad! Right... This is my son Paulo. Paulo, Monique. It's up to you now. Attack. What do you want to listen to? Loving you madly. My love, night and day... Two tickets, please. See what's coming soon? I've already seen it twice. Fab! Ah yeah, fab. "Atmosphere. Does this face look like atmosphere?" What's got into you? It's really famous. "Atmosphere, atmosphere." Haven't you seen the film? What are you on about? Forget it. "You have beautiful eyes, you know." And so, for the past 1000 years, pilgrims laden with offerings have tirelessly... No, Paul. ...before their amazed eyes there will appear the last bastion of Western Christendom... That's enough! Don't try it again. Carry on, and I'll leave. Right, this is a... A 2-bedroom. A good two-bedroom. So here you have... The kitchen. It's lovely, isn't it? How big is it? The dimensions? 1m92. Approximately. Let's continue. And this is the living room. We'll never get our sideboard through there. Your sideboard? Shall we continue, sir? So this is the... The bathroom. Paulo! Hurry! Come see how beautiful the bathroom is. A dream! It's just a bathroom. It's modern. And lastly, the master bedroom. So we were saying.. Albert Narboni. Just sign here. I saw a coffin go past the window. It's nothing. She's depressed. Don't pay any attention. Albert, I swear I saw a coffin. Stop, Mum! Listen to me. Yesterday you thought you saw Mrs Chiche. Today it's a coffin. Come and see. You're like St Thomas, you need to be shown. A coffin! There is a coffin. You see! I told you I had seen a coffin. The lift is too small. It needs replacing. Are you interested? What is this country? I could never live here! One day, I'd see you at the end of a rope. Why me? Next! I hope you don't die in this house. Stop that nonsense. Move it. Drink this. You'll feel better. Tell me, do you feel depressed? Yes, Doctor, I do. Ever since we left Algeria, it's as if the Sirocco were blowing in my head. I was never ill over there. Ever. But moving over here has unhinged me. When I look out the window, when I see all the cars, the rain, the cold... Sometimes I feel I'm dead. If you only knew, Doctor... All my bones ache as if I had been ripped apart. You must try to forget. Get a grip on yourself. - Don't let yourself go. - I know. That's why I said to myself, "Marguerite, go see a doctor." So I came. Right... I want you take this. And I assure you you're in perfect health. Try to take your mind off it. Go out. Meet up with friends. Relax. After all, this is your home now. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye, Doctor. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. The Palace's management has the pleasure and honour to present to you today, before the main film, and for the first time ever, an act that wowed America: John Silver and his magic plates. Give him a big hand! Paulo! Look at that man. He looks familiar! I can't even see his face. I'm sure he's from Tadjira. Jacob! What did I tell you? The sorbet tastes the same. Doesn't it, son? Tell me, have you heard from anyone from Tadjira? Here, in Paris, we haven't found anyone. Have we, Albert? The Armangos, for instance. Do you know where they are? Why do you want to know? Do they owe you money? He's so silly, Jacob! As big and as silly. Stop laughing. Louison? The poor man's dead. She's moved to Castres. Monette in Castres? Still in the candle business? Are you happy? And the Benichous? Toulouse. The other day, by accident, I discovered something and I'm working on it now. When you light the candle, it smells of... Candles smell of candles! Not of candles! This is an invention! And the Labrouches? Antibes. Have you seen Georgeo? The candle is perfumed. Rose, carnation, jasmine. Still in the food business? Big time, pal. It's a very, very big store. Come visit me, you'll see. I have my own telephone. With the repatriation loan, I plan to buy my own store. And, God willing, we'll find a flat. For my parents, seeing Jacob again was like meeting up with all their old pals. Actually, it's thanks to him that Dad found a flat even if it was a bit dear. With Jacob nearby, we regained our confidence. Listen, Jacob. It gives you the exact time. Day and night. - 3pm. - Then? 35 minutes. 15 seconds. Albert, I'm in a hurry. Stay a while. I sorted out your display. It's nice. - Where's your boy? - In the record department. Bye, Albert. Hey, Paulo! You never come see me. Not interested in candles now? Goodbye, son. Goodbye, Uncle. Miss. She's pretty. Jacob! Are you still on for Sunday? I've told Bonheur. It'd be good if you were. It'll cheer us up. Alright, see you Sunday. Sir, good to see you! I wanted to say, with all due respect, the last batch of tomatoes was hardly wonderful. Listen, Narboni. Come with me. I'll take this opportunity to say I'm very pleased with you. Hang on a minute. The fact is, you're an excellent salesman. And since you joined us, the fruit and veg department... sales have increased. Thank you, sir. However, a few problems need to be ironed out. Look around you, Narboni. You're not in the kasbah now. So don't shout. Don't invite your family, or your tribe. Don't call customers by their first name. Don't impose your foreign products. In a word, stop invading us. And stay in your place. Remove this rubbish. "The Smellnice candle"! You're right, sir. Simone, the till! Hey, Jacob! How are you? Very well. Put your feet in too, Lucien. It's lovely. It's freezing. It's good for your reaction. Sometimes, like at 18... Tell me... Your friend Jacob, is he an Arab? Jacob? An Arab? Jacob! Wait till you hear this! Tell him. On my life! Tell him! Jacob! You're an Arab! On my life, you're an Arab. Here's the couscous. Here's the stock. More stock. Here's some lovely chicken. And a wonderful little bright red chili. Loosen your belt, it'll make a big bulge! Stop! Why insist? He's had enough. He's had two platefuls. There's more. I want to see that plate as clean as when I gave it to you! Now do you see why we went to the hammam? Well, Lucien? What do you think of my couscous? My dear Marguerite, it was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Perfect, perfect... You've turned me into a couscous fan. You know, so much is missing here. Bland chicken, veg that's impossible to find... Trivial details. No, really, it's... It's a dish that... is well worth... discovering. An attack! Paulo, shut the window. Smelling salts! It's OK. He's coming round. He's coming round. Lucien? What's wrong with you all? Nothing. You had a funny turn. An attack. We overfed you. Not at all. I've just had an idea. Really? When you think, you're dead to the world. Mum's getting the dessert. There's more in the kitchen. How marvellous! Bring it on! I'll put it here. You can help yourselves. My wife made them. They're great. Get stuck in! Well? What was your idea? You gave us a fright. My idea? Ah yes! It's to do with the couscous I've just eaten. I imagined... You'll laugh. Oh well. Imagine, my dear Marguerite, that pushed for time, you wanted to serve us something other than couscous. Let's say... a cassoulet. - What would you have done? - Opened a can. Unbelievable! Sorry. You do make us laugh. You're such a joker! Couscous in a can? Is that what you meant? Yes! After all, Albert, as a grocery store expert, you know what can be canned. Couscous. Chicken. Chick peas. Why would I put it in a can? Why not my salad in jars! The couscous has to be hot. You'd be working night and day! An electric machine! And you, Jacob? What do you think of my idea? Lucien. I never beat about the bush. If I were in business, if I had a lot of money, if the banks were behind me, not for a second... would I hesitate to open a couscous factory. Within a few days, we became obsessed with canned couscous. Bonheur wanted to build a factory. Jacob was going to study the scientific way to preserve couscous. My father wanted in too. My mother wouldn't hear of it. The atmosphere at home! I had one idea in mind. Antibes, two-minute stop. Narboni! Alright? And you? Georgeo! Are you in the movies? My mum bought it for me. Jump in! It's the car, huh? You think a car like this, with wood, leather and carpet... costs a bomb! Don't be stupid! I'm not jealous because of your car. - Why are you sulking? - I'm not sulking. I'm wondering if we can still be friends. You know my mum's loaded! You'd rather we lived in a shack and owned an old banger? In any case, we lost the farm. Your dad lost his store. We lost Algeria! What difference does it make? The difference is, you live here. And we live in Paris like beggars. - Were you followed? - I'm with Paulo Narboni. Where is he? Show your face! What's in the bag? Just open the door. - Give me the paper. - Here. Don't touch. He'll know we've been in his room. Look. From the Crédit Lyonnais in Oran. 500 million. The OAS's treasure. - Was he the accountant? - What do you think? They're colonial notes! Of course they are! It wasn't the Bank of France. So it's worthless? There's more. Come and see. - And is this worthless? - All these weapons! P38. Nice, isn't it? There! Son of a bitch! You couldn't help it, huh? You had to show him! I'm warning you, Paulo. You're an accomplice now. Know what'll happen if you talk? Georgeo. Keep watch, OK? I'm going to the loo. So I said to her... "Barbara!" It was Barbara. Damn fucking war! The same night, I took with the treasure and the OAS on my tail. Since then I've been running scared. Nowhere to hide, never any respite. All that for a woman. An ungrateful cow who went and dumped me. I sacrificed my life and my honour for her! You have a broken man before you now. Rich but broken. Battered by life. How are the sardines? Have a taste. Delicious. Shit! They're here. Paulo, help me. They're heavy, these banknotes. Son, you don't have a 10,000-franc note, do you? You never know, huh? Don't do anything stupid, OK? Goodbye, sonny. No, Georgeo. I'm not crazy. You think I don't know these notes are just paper? It's all I have from Algeria. I'll die with it. Captain, ready when you are. Bye, kids! Act fast, hit hard! We Africans have come from afar We've come from the colonies To defend France That's how Sauveur vanished in the night. Close your eyes. What for? Are you queer now? I'm serious. Close your eyes for a second. Tell me where you are. I'm in the car. Where else would I be? Breathe in. Smell that? Have you forgotten? How could I have? I'll never forget it. Georgeo, why don't you come to Paris? Monique! Someone's here for you. I'm coming! Are you looking for something? I'm looking for you! Did he say he had a mum? Am I dead? - Who? - Paulo Narboni, my son. Ring any bells? I'm his mum. He's too ashamed. I wanted to see this Monique. My word! You're not afraid of red lipstick and eyeliner. What do you want from him? Why are you hovering? You want to marry him? Get your clutches into him? What'll you do with a baby? How will you eat? Tell me how you'll eat! Have you made him do it? Have you done it with him? The thing you do to have babies... Thank God, catastrophe avoided! I prefer his magazines. Why won't you answer? Have I said something upsetting? My bike! Our furniture has arrived! Bloody rain! Georgeo! Come see! It's certainly small, but it's well furnished. My Brownie! Don't move. I'll take a photo. Smile! No, Albert! Bonheur will have the shirt of your back! Why get so annoyed? I haven't done anything. I haven't seen Lucien for four days. Lucien! Let's talk about him. He's lying in wait like a spider. Stop imagining things. It's Jacob's idea. Jacob! He isn't God, you know! Besides, the loan... We need it to buy a grocery store, not a factory. - Mr Narboni! - Alright! With 1 million, I make 10. Didn't Bonheur say so? - With 2 million, 20. - That's all. Don't be smart! Or you'll feel the back of my hand. I spoke to that Monique. - What did you say? - You'll see! Georgeo, sonny, where did you spring from? Albert, look! The boys are back from Antibes! Have you eaten? Your hair is soaking wet. I'll look after you. Come on, sit down. Is it raining out? Paulo, please. Tell your father not to give Lucien the grocery store money. Your mum thinks I'm the village idiot. What can I do? We don't even have the loan. I can meet Bonheur's partners. One is a banker. All I said was, it was a good idea. Did you hear me say more? I said, "It's a good idea." In fact, it's an excellent idea. Here, Mrs Ocenego. Say hello to Norbert! Come without your mum today? My mum? Forget it. She's tired. Did you believe her? No! You could give me a baby. This is my friend, Georgeo Labrouche. Monique. Georges Labrouche. I thought all you lot had surnames ending in O. Alright, lovebirds? - Maybe she has her period. - If she does, then... By the way... I went out with a friend. You don't mind, do you? Why would I mind? Who is he? That poofter, the bookstore guy's son? Josiane! Gérard is taking me to the cinema. Come with! - Brief Encounter is on. - I can't. Come on! Problems, lovebirds? Don't look so glum. One lost, 100,000 gained. Damn, a blow like that. Just before school starts too. You're leaving. What am I going to do? Think I'm happy about being on my own? Who will I copy? The French are good at maths. And French! What's that? Couscous in a can, my dear lady. I'm not talking to you! It's your couscous. You gave it to me 2 weeks ago. Don't stick that in my face! 2 weeks old! It hasn't gone off. Look at the can. It's perfect. No oxidation. It doesn't smell. I came up with it thanks to my research. Imagine! Make me happy. Try it. Not on your life! Are you barmy? Do you have a spoon? A spoon? I'll go see. I have this. But it hasn't been used. See if I die. It's delicious. Just as good now. Couscous is eaten cold! Here. Try it, madam. - Where can I buy it? - Nowhere. It's my couscous! You can't buy it. Marguerite! Know what there'll be on the can? A photo. A photo? - Your photo. - My photo? - You can forget that! - Pity. I'd made an appointment with the best photographer. Taki, the Japanese man who photographs actresses. Michèle Morgan... Just imagine! Your photo! Like in the movies. On every single can. Well? Do you like the plot? There's nothing special about it. It's south-facing. I should have worn a raincoat! Come see, Saint Thomas. My dear Albert, things will move very fast. You ought to join us. He's odd, your friend. Jean-Claude? He's had a hard life. Foreign Legion. Dien Bien Phu. Two years in a bamboo cage. 70cm by 80cm. He's a fantastic engineer. It's time to talk business. Are you with us or not? Can I think about it some more? You're absolutely unbelievable. We offer you a great deal, and you turn your nose up when we ask you for a reasonable 5 million. Reasonable? 5 million is a huge sum. I earn 50,000 a month at the grocery store. I can't come onboard like that. I have a wife and child. Think, Lucien! I was wrong about you. Forget it. Lucien! Wait. Just wait! What's the banker investing? 30 million cash. I'm putting in 10, Jean-Claude too. I didn't know you were so rich, Lucien. Remember, Albert. 1 million, 10 million. 2 millions, 20 million. What do you think, Paulo? It's a shame your mother isn't here. Naturally, you'll run the factory. Since we will be using your wife's recipe. Mr Vidal fully agrees. Jean-Claude too. I don't care if he's sick, his laughing is annoying me. - Is he making fun? - Not at all. Jean-Claude! You're annoying Mr Narboni. You're wasting time. I'm an engineer. I'll speak as a technician. I can see the factory now. This plot is perfect. We bring in the bulldozers. Look, Mr Carboni. Narboni. No need for trucks. We put a Caterpillar at each end. 50-ton excavators. Push and you have the fill. Do you see? I'm laughing because... With or without you, the factory will be a success. I'm in! For 5 million. I'll give you the loan. Tomorrow, I'll see Bauvergne. Friday, the repatriated. Saturday, you'll have your money. You should have a sticker saying "revolver"! What a beautiful day. It's a shame to work in such fine weather. To think that... we'd could go for a stroll, dear Marguerite, just the two of us. Lucien, my feet are killing me. These new shoes are an absolute nightmare. I'll take them back to the store. We'd have lunch in a lovely restaurant then... a romantic stroll on the island in the lake. We're here! Who's this? Boys! You look like rich men, sitting there. Waiter! Champagne. Lucien, I don't have the money. I didn't get the loan. But the champagne is good. - Sorry? - This is good. General Bauvergne, the son of a bitch, filled out the application with the name Simoni. Not Narboni. I don't believe it! That's crap. Do something! Take action. I gave them a right talking-to. They want Simoni not Narboni. Keep calm, I'll have it in a few months. Set up the business, I'll join you later. Your partner says it's OK. It's a minor delay. This way, I can see the factory grow. It'll be nice. A minor delay? That's what you call it? I'm sick of you. Leaving the sinking ship! You, in business? Just look at yourself! You're a failure. You're nothing, a loser. Vegetate with your poor family! Keep calm. You were my friend. Now just shut up and go. Leave us alone. Don't tell me what to do Go back to your shack with your two-bit M. Morgan. What did you call my wife? Let go of me! - What did you call her? - Let go of him. Mr Bonheur! Isn't the champagne on you? You invite but don't pay? Service is included. What's going on? We return the cash. Or they'll count an extra day. Those little jerks! They had a revolver. A gun? Fuck! See how he ran when he saw the gun? You were dumb enough to load it too. If he'd snatched the cash, the bullet would have made a hole. You don't get it. The case was empty. My dad set him up to expose him. Don't you Labrouches think? Georgeo! Where do you think you are? This isn't Tadjira. The war's over. Bonus. We never forgot October 18 1962. In 1966, we finally got the loan for the repatriated. It was enough for Dad to buy a grocery store. He ekes out a living. He's going bald. On Sundays, we go to the match together. Mum stays at home as usual. Recently, she's started talking to herself On Fridays she makes couscous to make sure I visit her. She just watches me eat. They spend summers in Jacob's Cannes villa. He's doing very well. As he took out a patent, whenever someone opens a can of couscous, he sits there in the sun and gets paid. Georgeo Labrouche, I never saw him again. As for me, Paulo Narboni, the grocer's son, I've told you my story. I didn't want a sad ending, but honestly... I feel really down. French girls are so disappointing! Subtitles: ECLAIR MEDIA
