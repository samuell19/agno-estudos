Abdi teh ayeuna... ...gaduh hiji boneka Teu kinten saena... ...sareng lucuna Risa! You always get lost in your imagination every time you write. Sorry. What’s up? I'm hungry. Let's order some food. What do you want? Meatball soup? Anything. But that. Oh, come on. Her name is Canting. She haunts an old theater in Bandung. Her ambition got the best of her. If you ever visited the theater, some of you might’ve felt her presence... ...her dreams and her regrets. In that abandoned theater, she's still dancing. Each day, my communication portal with them grows stronger. The unseen entities. Entities you know as ghosts. Some have malicious intents. But then they go away. Some became my friends, and are here to stay. Although I can’t help but wonder... ...what my life would be like without them. Is that what you call a normal life? I wish I knew. Back with me, Dimasta. And me, Joe Erick. On 103.13 FM, Arban Radio, Bandung! Now, back to our topic tonight... ...about things you haven’t told your partners. Serious stuff. Let's read the messages. First message is from Kiki, at Kopo Permai. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years... ...but he’s not aware that I'm actually... Actually what?/ I wonder what… Hold that thought. We'll be right back after... I have a song for my special someone. I wish her good night Sounds like she’s very special. Peter! Hello? Happy birthday, Dimasta! Sorry, I didn't hear the alarm. I wanted to call and wish you happy birthday All right, don’t forget your morning prayer. Again, happy birthday. Bye. Why do you boys keep hiding my phone? We don't want the alarm That's right, Risa. But I purposely set the alarm ...to wish Dimas happy birthday. So, what’s your day like today? I have a technical meeting for the upcoming Why? Can't a girl ask her boyfriend Are you writing today?/ Which chapter was that again? Can you refresh my memory? Nice try. Can't a guy ask his girlfriend I'll let you read when I’m ready. Promise. Aren’t you gonna be late for school?/ I needed to do this homework this morning. Hi, Dimas!/ Hi, Riri! You’ll come home straight after school, yes? / Okay! She is so gonna be late for school. Peter. William. Janshen. Hans. Hendrick. I'm going out. You can’t come with me. Raina!/ Yes, Clara. Yes? Why is there a question mark This is such a beginner’s mistake. But when I proofread it, Does that look like a period to you? I changed the period into a question mark. You did? Why? That’s Flashnews for this morning. Stay tuned on 103.13 FM Arban FM Not again. You again, wasn’t it? Really? He got you again? Stop you two. You. I need video content for tomorrow. Don't worry, Miss Producer. Nope, not happening. I need Raina and Dimas We're leaving now./ Okay. This is so unlike you, inviting people to our house. Only four of his friends from work. Yeah, we're gonna study together Study or gossip? Gossip is just a bonus. How long are you planning You know what happened before. They all think I'm weird, Even you used to think of me that way. I don't want to lose Dimas. He's different. If you believe he is different... ...he would accept you just the way you are. Get inside. I want you all to stay here. Dimas and his friends are coming soon. Aren't we gonna play together today? Today is for me and my friends. We are your friends too, Risa. Risa! Riri! Hello? Risa? Riri? Hello? Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday./ Thank you! Blow the candles. Thanks. Good thing you finally came. We've been here since 2 hours ago, Don't blame me. Blame Miss Producer here. She buried me with work, We have all agreed to try to spoil his day Don't blame me you’re such a boss pleaser. I’m not blaming you. My pleasure. Who's hungry?/ Me! Anton is! Just look at his face. Then, dig in. One night when I was at work alone... ...he told me to throw a fit... Didn’t I tell you to stay here? We just wanted to play with you, Risa. But I can't right now. You're not fun anymore! Fine, find somebody else more fun! Yo, guys, it's Anton again… From Dimasta's surprise party… Here at Dimas' girlfriend's house, Or is it Risa Waraswat... Maybe it's Risa Awesome-wati. The party was a success, But I desperately need Abdi teh ayeuna... Ton. You've taken everybody’s greeting except me. Let's do it./ Just say it to him then, I need to poop. Pooping in other people's house What are you talking about?/ What bad luck? You used my toilet before, So it was bad luck. For you. Bye! Take care. Thank you. What? I still can't believe you arranged Thanks. I have one more surprise for you. Really? Surprise! Help me clean up the house. I was gonna do it anyway before you asked.

I don't want to see you anymore! I don't want to see any of you anymore... Abdi teh... ...ayeuna... ...gaduh hiji boneka Teu kinten saena... ...sareng lucuna Go to sleep, Riri. I'm beat. Risa? Is it wrong what I said to them last night? Am I a bad person for saying those thing to them? But they have injured Maybe our friendship is a curse I wish I couldn't see them again. I wish I could close my third eye. I just want to live like a normal person. Can I? You can. My name is Kartika. I'm Risa. What you wrote there... ...is that really what you’ve been longing for? It is what I feel right now. If you don't want to see them again... ...you can close it. It?/ Your third eye. Repeat after me. Abdi ngagaleuh tinu sanes.

William? Janshen? Hans? Hendrick? Strange. Is this what normal like? This feels unusual. It's too quiet. Like an empty space. Is this what they call “Sunyaruri”? Hi. What happened to your eye? I have no idea. Put a compress on it. Okay. Did you take care of your hand? I did. I went to the hospital with Clara. Clara took you? We had a meeting in Braga, Don't forget to put a compress on your eyes. Okay, Boss. I'm gonna play you a song How about Bang Rhoma? That’s your idol! All right. Sweet dreams! Bye! Sweet dreams! You're so cute, Dimas. Can I be your sweetie too? Don't touch me. Please don't turn off my alarm. I don't want to be late for school again. I just didn't want the alarm I'm scared./ Me, too. She can't get to us here. But what about Risa? Ri? I think I've made a huge mistake. But I was so angry with them. Wake up, Ri. Let's do morning prayer. Wake up, Ri. It's time for morning prayer. Ri. Wake up. Aw so sweet! How does it feel getting a surprise party? Man, I'm so... and Dimas was really surprised… But I desperately need to use the toilet. Abdi teh... What's up? I was writing. I think midnight. Your eye's still puffy. The compress didn't help? It didn’t. But it doesn't hurt. I hope it's nothing serious. But shouldn’t you go see a doctor? I should, but I don't feel like going out. The rain hasn’t stopped since yesterday. And and there’s a leak on my bedroom ceiling./ It ‘s nothing but sunny here. So was yesterday. That's weird. I have to pee. Dim? Hi. What were you saying? That I almost peed myself. You said it's been raining Because here it's been... It's time for our briefing. Oh, sorry.

You're just seeking my attention, Come on, Risa. That's right, Risa. Hang the dolls too. Yes, Risa! It will make the rain go away. Is this okay?

Ri. You said it's only raining here, right? Dimas said that, too. This is not an ordinary rain, Ri. What do you mean? I'm not sure either. Why don't you ask your little friends I've closed my third eye. I can't see them anymore. But now I'm scared. I can still smell “danur” scent, Look at this. Some of the pages I wrote are missing. And those pages are about Peter and friends. Who took them? Peter, forgive me. But I can't see you... Risa, what happened? Nothing. Are you sure you don't want to see a doctor? Are you sure you're okay? Your eye is getting worse. It might be an infection. You're cold, too. How about I call mom? She might know what to do with your eye.
