Hello, dear. Dear, why are you calling me this late? I'm doing guard duty. What? I can't hear you clearly. I'm doing guard duty! You can video call while on guard duty? Of course not. But I wanted to show you something. What? Did you see that? What's that? I don't know. She has been standing there for a while. She hasn't moved at all. She hasn't moved? How long has it been? Probably around ten minutes. Please let me in. Please let me in! - Miss. - Someone is after me. Please let me in! Miss, what happened? Someone is trying to kill me! Please let me in! Let me check with my Sergeant. Sergeant. Send. Sergeant, there's a woman outside the gate. She looks injured. And she's covered in blood, all over her clothes. She said someone is trying to kill her. What should I do now? Let her in. Yes, Sergeant. I'm with the woman in the guard room. However... She is acting weird. What do you mean? She has been standing in the corner for a long time. What is she doing? I don't know. - She might have been in an accident. - Corporal Phua, this is Sergeant Chan, over. Yes, Sergeant. Why are you not at the gate? I'm in the guard room with the woman now. What woman? The woman that I reported to you on the walkie-talkie. You told me to let her in. What are you talking about? I didn't use my walkie-talkie until now. You stay there and you... Sergeant... Corporal Phua had let the spirit in when he opened the gate of the camp. He died of a heart attack that night. He was only 19 years old. I'm going to Penang to visit your aunt. I'll only be back on Tuesday. There's food in the fridge. Just heat it up. Remember to wash your clothes too. To delete this message... In March 1967, the very first batch of army recruits was selected to do full-time national service. These men were not just unlucky. They were absolutely jinxed. But their greatest misfortune was not their enlistment, but something much more terrifying. One of the recruits dug up a dead body. It was wearing the old Japanese army uniform. The strange thing was this. If this Japanese soldier had died during the world war, surely the body would have been decomposed, leaving only a set of bones. But this body looked like he had just died. The soldiers covered the grave and continued to dig the trenches until the next morning. But they did not know that they had already awoken something truly terrifying. If only I was born in 1948 and not 1949, then I wouldn't need to serve in the army and be forced to dig the holes. If I wanted to dig holes, I might as well be doing it at a construction site. I'll get paid rather than wasting my time here. Stop talking. If Sergeant hears us, we will be in trouble. That garbage has no guts. Let me tell you. In times of war, people like him will definitely become dogs. Lackeys! Sergeant! Pardon me. I didn't see you. I didn't know that you were behind... I want you to open your mouth wide. Open your mouth! Did I say you can move? Since you love to move, let me teach you what it means to stay still. Bury his head too. Now! Seng! Seng! Are you all right? Very good. You love to help others out, right? Tonight you can all forget about sleeping. You will stay here and dig your own graves. The three recruits could not take the punishment from the psychotic sergeant anymore and decided to go AWOL. But they got lost in the depths of the jungle. It was as if their eyes were covered by some spiritual being. They kept going round and round in the jungle. Just as they were about to give up, they came upon an old hut and decided to go in and ask for directions. Is anyone at home? We are soldiers. We got lost and wanted to get directions. Is anyone home? We are very thirsty. Can we drink the water here? Silence means consent. Let's go. Are you human? We are soldiers. We're lost. This is bad. We are done for. What happened? Three nights ago, a weird creature appeared. I don't know what it was, but it was definitely not human. It was dressed in a Japanese military uniform. It came in the middle of the night and killed many of the villagers. Including... my husband. The rest of the villagers escaped in shock. Hide. Hide yourselves now! What is this? Kao. Hey. It's gone. Let's go! What are you waiting for? Hurry! The two boys ran like crazy from the hut into the jungle, but nothing could've prepared them for what they were about to see. Fatty. Darn Fatty. You scared us. How can you still laugh? Fatty. Darn it! The Japanese spirit killed everyone that night and they all died in the same manner with their stomachs cut open and their intestines spilling out of their bodies. Hello Mia, it has been a while. How are you? For me, life is awesome. Time seems to have flown by. I've been in the army for two months. In these two months spent in BMT, I've learned many new things. My physical condition has never been better. Turn to your left! My platoon sergeant holds me in high regard. What on earth are you doing? The other day, he even praised me for being a great leader and said that I would most likely be named Best Recruit. I have also made many new friends. My army buddies all adore me. They listen to what I have to say and treat me like a leader. I showed them the picture that we took together and they all think that we are very compatible. They all think that we're a match made in heaven. Hey! Give it to me. Give it to me! "I showed them the picture that we took together and they said we are very compatible." Your girlfriend is so pretty. Are you sure? Steady, she's really pretty. This photo is a bit weird. It's fake. Look, he has a shadow, but she doesn't have one. Your Photoshop skills suck. Did you Photoshop the photo? I'm asking, did you Photoshop the photo? Did you create a girlfriend because you don't have one? God, what a pervert! Is she fake? Call her now. Now! Call her! I asked you to call her now. You hear me? Hurry up. Call now. Hurry. Who? Hello? What happened? Are you okay? Guys, Sergeant said to fall in. Let's go! Fall in. Let's go. - Today is my book out day - Today is my book out day - book out, book out - book out, book out - Today is my book out day - Today is my book out day - book out, book out day - book out, book out day - No more SOC - No more SOC The year was 1983. A group of commando soldiers were training deep in the jungle of Temburong in Brunei. The platoon sergeant was demonstrating the art of skinning a snake. First. - But little did they know - Cut off the snake. That there was someone, or rather something watching them silently. And then, the skin can come off easily. Smoothly like a condom. What's so funny? Have you guys not used a condom before? - Encik. - What? - Can I take the snakeskin back? - Why, Moti? Is the convenience store's condom too small for you? Encik. You know, I know. That's enough. You don't need to say so loudly. You guys don't try to be funny. You are commandos, not co-monkeys. Pay attention. After removing the skin, what should you do? Make snake sashimi. Sashimi, your head! Moti, come out. Since you love your own snake so much, come and help me. What's the strength? - Strength? - Yes. My strength is very strong. Power, your bloody head. The number of people. I want to know the number of people here. I'm sorry, Encik. It's eight. Eight plus me, a total of nine. Cut it into nine pieces. One each. Barbecue time. Go and sharpen your sword first. - Encik. - What? - I cannot eat. - Why? Are you allergic to snakes? No, Encik. Religious reasons. I didn't know that Shaolin monks can be commandos. Chop into nine pieces still. I will eat double. I give you all good things, but you all don't want it. The big snake can bless your little snake with power. Don't be surprised. You don't believe me? How do you think I have so many girlfriends? One of your girlfriends asked me to pass something to you. Who? I didn't know our chief clerk, Ma'am Chew, is your type. Darn it! Disgusting picture. What's so funny? Faster! Where is Encik? He's still sleeping? He must've been playing with his snake the whole night. That's why he can't wake up. - Encik. - Encik. What time is the transport coming? Encik. Last night, you told us to gather at the pickup point by 0900 hours. Good. It's still early. Then I have more time. - Did you see that? - What? That army bag just moved. Really? - Encik. - Encik. Encik, don't you want it loaded on the tonner? After three weeks of training in the hot and humid Temburong jungle, the boys were dying to go back to Singapore. Encik! They reached Singapore on National Day and there were not many people in the camp. How's it going? Good, sir. I'm sorry I couldn't join you in the exercise. Is everything all right? All good, sir. - Only one died. - What? One died? Why didn't anyone notify me on such an important matter? I meant, only a snake died. Is that funny? If someone really died, I would have to write many reports. I hate writing reports. What are you doing? Nothing, sir. I'm just a bit tired from all the outfield training. Are you sure you're all right? I'm sure. I'm quite tired. I'd better head to the bunk first. Don't you think Encik is acting strangely? Yes, I do. I knew he had a crush on me. He always looked at me with such sneaky eyes. I never thought he would be this bold to actually hug me in front of you. I've something for you. You got it? What do you need this snakeskin for? In Japan, they believe snakeskin is a very powerful and effective amulet and lucky charm. With this good luck charm, maybe I'll finally get my first girlfriend. So powerful? Maybe I can use this to get a hot girl like Joey Wong and finally lose my virginity. Do Indians also know Joey Wong? Of course. She's so hot. Who doesn't know her? Wait. Are you still a virgin? Didn't you say you lost your virginity at 16? You are busy right? I'll see you later. Hello. Ying Sheng? What? Don't be funny. You told me you can give it to me by today. Ma'am Chew will definitely want it by 5 p.m. Tomorrow? Are you crazy? Don't you know how mental she is? You know she is not married, right? That's why her work is like her husband. Let me tell you. I think she's still a virgin. How do I know? See the way she walks. Her legs stick together like a pair of chopsticks. You'd better send me the report by today. If I don't receive it by 4:59 p.m., I will cancel all your off! Are you very free? - No, ma'am. - No? I noticed how free you are. You have time to talk behind my back. - No, ma'am. - You're so free. That's good. There is a toilet bowl in the ladies clogged up with poop. You love to talk poop, right? I want you to go clear that poop! Why are you still here? Go and clear poop! Yes, ma'am! How dare he say I'm an unwanted virgin? My admirers form a queue all the way to Johor Bahru. Encik Teo hugged me too yesterday. He took advantage of me. I walk like a pair of chopsticks? Do I have to walk with my legs wide open to be called sexy? He said I'm an unwanted virgin? I can spread my legs open too! I also have to clear poop during National Service. Darn smelly! The poop is huge too! It must be Ma'am Chew's poop. Garbage! Is that snakeskin really so powerful? Excuse me, can I help you? I mean, good afternoon, ma'am. That? That's nothing. It's just a souvenir that one of the cadets gave me. Ma'am Chew? Where is Ma'am Chew? Ma'am! Who's that? Don't tell me this is the power of the snakeskin? She's way hotter than Joey Wong! The camp commander immediately called a special department in the army. The special department had only one person in it and this person was a mysterious medium who could conquer all kinds of evil spirits and demons. Hey, help me take out my bird. What? I meant the bird in my car. - All right. - Be careful, it bites. What is this for? It'll be useful during the exorcism. Your bird is really small. Is it useful? Size doesn't matter. It depends on how you use it. Show me the corpses. Quick, follow me. Look at their bodies. They are all soft. It seems like their bones are in pieces. You're wrong. There is one item that will never be soft. See? It's still hard. That's disgusting. Sir. Are there any females in your camp? There's none. It's such a huge camp and there's not even one female? Does that one count as a female? Sir, I think so. We seem to have one. Our chief clerk, Ma'am Chew. Bring me to her. If she's not the victim, then she's the one harming people. Over here. I'll head in first. If you hear me scream, don't come in. When I scream "come in," then you come in. If I don't scream "come in," don't you come in. Understand? Understand? Yes. Please help me with this. Boy, don't play with my bird. You look much prettier here. Darn spirit, what are you doing here? Sir, should we go in? Didn't he say if he screams, we should not go in? If he screams "come in," then we should go in. Now that he didn't scream "come in," we should not go in. Understand? Yes. Are you all right? Your Ma'am Chew is possessed by a snake spirit. She followed you guys back from Brunei all for revenge. - What revenge? - Your Encik killed her boyfriend. And the cadets ate her boyfriend. So now she's here to eat them? She ate Encik a long time ago. And is now a thousand-year snake spirit. Can you get rid of her? No, she is too powerful. One is a thousand-year spirit. One is a thousand-year virgin. The combination is invincible. What do we do now? There is one solution. Once, there was an exorcist of a powerful snake spirit. My master's master's elderly master taught me. We must find a suitable candidate. What candidate? Someone who has not eaten her boyfriend and is still a virgin. Most importantly, he must be extremely handsome to attract the snake spirit. Look for an extremely... Extremely handsome guy? Cadet Desmond. When you joined the commandos, you took an oath, right? Yes, sir! Are you ready to uphold that oath? Yes, sir! Are you ready to sacrifice for our unit? Yes... Are you ready to die for Singapore? - What? - Just kidding! You don't need to die. But I need you to seduce a disgusting, terrifying, and deadly snake spirit. What? You have chosen well. You are the best cadet. Look. My master's master's elderly master used this method to deal with snake spirits. Put sulfur inside the grenade along with my sutra recitation. Find the perfect timing. Place this grenade into the snake spirit's mouth. You will hear a "boom" sound. The snake spirit is doomed. Hurry up, this is a perfect time! We need to separate Ma'am Chew and the snake spirit. How can we do that? Shout whatever provokes her. Okay. Ma'am Chew! Two cadets lost their bayonets. Do we have to write a report? Yes, we need to write a report. Ma'am Chew, I'll get the cadets to sign the lost form, but you'll still need to follow up. You'll have to write a report. Yes, we need a report. Ma'am Chew, the Chief of Army is coming over for a spot check. If he sees your scandalous behavior, he will charge you. If you get charged, I'll have to write many reports. If I have to write many reports, you'll have to help me with them. Do you understand? What report? I hate writing reports! What are you guys doing? Who put all this here? Who approved of this? Why is it so messy? Why am I in a mess too? And you, Cadet Desmond. Come and see me at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Your behavior... Sir, we're depending on you. Don't mess it up. Hurry! Sir, hurry up! Sir, hurry up! Let me go on top. They thought they had destroyed the snake spirit with the sulfur grenade. But this was an extremely powerful snake spirit. Not only was it not destroyed, it grew even more powerful and it was angry. Very, very angry. Who are you? I'm Tommy. Tommy? I don't know you. I've no friends named Tommy either. You've got the wrong person. Are you a pervert? Why are you using my photo? Are you Mindy Yeung's friend? I've said this before. I didn't mean to hurt her. Please let me off. Are you Mindy Yeung's friend? A psycho with no friends! Fat and ugly! Ugly and crazy! Even my poop looks better than you! The world would be a better place without you. Do you still remember me? You said that I'm a freak. Ugly and disgusting. I'm hideous. You even said... "a world without you means a better tomorrow for me." I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it. Don't worry. I forgive you. Really? Yes. However, I need your help. My help? A world without you means a better tomorrow for me. Something's weird. Of course it's weird. How can the bloody loser have such a hot girlfriend? It's not that. It's really weird. What's weird? I don't know. It's just strange.
