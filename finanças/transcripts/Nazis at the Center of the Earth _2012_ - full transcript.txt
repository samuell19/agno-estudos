Heil Hitler. Uhh! Aah! Yaah! Niflheim Station, do you read me? Niflheim, do you copy? This is Niflheim. That you, Mark? Yes. Hey, it's me. We've set up Site N-417 And are preparing to core. Over. All right, we got you on the map. Over. Hey, May, When I get back, Do you maybe want to share a cup of coffee? Yeah, like we do as our usual routine? Over. Right. Like usual. We'll check in again in 30. Over. All right, Mark. Stay warm. Over. Right. Over and out. Hey, Paige, do you copy? Damn, it's cold. It's summer in February. Imagine spending a winter here. Can't believe you've done that. Antarctica is the new frontier for medical research. Do you have any idea what it's like to find an 8 million year old viable sample of Streptomyces frozen in the Permafrost? Now let's see what kind of nasties we find. Stop! Stop it! Stop! We've hit metal. What the hell? Don't touch her! Mark! Where do you want these bug samples, Dr. Moss? By the Autoclave. Where did you get this? Dr. Reistad. Where the 3 Molecular Phenotypes of the Hemoglobin are detectable through Electrophoresis. Can I have a word with you? I'm in the middle of a demonstration. Can it wait? No. Please excuse me. What happened? What is this? Vibrio Vulnificus. I know what it is. I want to know what it's doing here. What's the problem, Doctor? Heh. You're not concerned that you nearly Exposed this station to flesh eating bacteria? Whoa. He looks pissed. What are doing here? What are you doing? This is unacceptable. Wouldn't mess with him. Which one? Reistad would kick Lucas ass any day of the week. Hey, Silje, is it really true that Reistad gave himself an emergency Appendectomy when he was stranded here alone over winter? Well, he does have a scar down there. How do you know that? And I'm not going to allow you to pull another stunt like you did 3 summers ago. What are you talking about? You infected your entire team with Influenza just to see how quickly the virus would spread in a closed environment. You very well know that that experiment led to the discovery of a vaccine that saved thousands of people. Look, you already hold the dubious distinction of losing more personnel than any other Station Chief in the history of this project. Dr. Moss, Antarctica is a very dangerous place. Until you've lived here for 10 years... Then you can start telling me how to do things. I am the LSO, and we are going to follow A.T.S. Protocols. You are not going to lose anyone on my watch. Paige and Mark. What? They haven't checked in. Paige! Mark! Paige! Mark! What happened? Generator explosion? There'd be wreckage. He's right. Paige! Dr. Reistad. Yeah? It's blood. Look! Hey, footprints! Those look like.. Like drag marks. Okay, everyone back in the Snowcat. I'll stay on foot. Mark. Mark. Mark. Thank God you're okay. Has the bleeding stopped? Yeah. It's stopped. Good. That's good. Who are these guys? Soldiers? Military exercises are prohibited in Antarctica. Why are they wearing.. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Paige! Mark! Where are you taking him? Mark! Well, he's determined. I'll give him that. But would he be doing this If it wasn't Dr. Morgan? I think it's romantic. Yeah. What have you done to me? I can't move. Who's there? Who are you? What do you want? Stop. What are you going to do? No. What are you doing? Stop. What are you doing? No. Stop. No. Please. Oh, God. Aah! Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, God. God. Oh, God, no. Please. I want to go home. I want to go home. I want to go home. Please, stop. Oh, God. Don't. Please. No. No. Oh, God. No. Oh, God, no. No, no, no. No, don't. Please. I need a rope! Whew. What are you doing? Tracks end here. It's too dangerous. I have to. You'd do it for Silje. Okay. Give me some slack. Ah. You don't want to forget this. Thanks. You said I couldn't lose anybody on my watch. Why is it blue? It's not. It's clear. What? We are 50 feet below the surface. The ice you see is clear, but the water behind it is blue. That's the ocean. I feel a warm breeze. Hey, Guys, it's warmer than it should be. The heat's coming from the tunnel down there. I'm ready to go. Dead end. Mark. Mark. Everything's gonna be okay. Over here. Help. Help... Me. Help. Help. Hel.. Help me. Help me, Paige. Uhh! What are you doing? I'm going on. No. You have no idea how deep that shaft is. If the pressure doesn't kill you, it could drop you into the ocean below. Paige is down there. You don't know that. There's no other way. All right. There's 100 feet of rope. If you don't signal by the time you reach the end, then we're pulling you back up. You got it? Okay. All right. Yank on it three times when you get to the end. You understand? Yeah. Okay. Good luck to you. Rope. Got it? Yeah. Give me slack. Let him go. Let him go. Keep your weight back. There you go. Looking good. Looking good. 50. 75. And 100. Doc! Wait! Oh! Oh, my God. Lucas! Did he fall? He unclipped it. Lucas! Lucas! Are you okay? Rahul, hammer a Piton into the ice, and tie off your end. I'm going in after him. I'll go. Wait, no. Hey, you sure about this? I'm lighter. We wouldn't be able to pull you both up. If everything's fine at the end of the rope, I'll pull three times. You sure? Be careful. Lucas! Lucas! What the hell. Lucas. Lucas. Dr. Moss. My God. That's what I said. The infections on your men's faces, have you tried using Prednisolone to counteract mismatched HLAs? Is it more effective than CSA? Cyclosporin is still effective, but the scope of allergenic transplantation means you're probably dealing with a much higher degree of Histocompatibility Symptoms. You are a doctor? Mic... Yes, I'm a doctor. And you've had better results using Corticosteroids? Better than Calcineurin Inhibitors, but not as effective as ATGs. I am not familiar with this treatment. The succesful use of Polyclonal Anti-T-Cell Antibodies is relatively recent. What is the source of the Immunoglobulin? Rabbits, usually. Sometimes horses. You are of German descent? Yes. Tell me everything you know about CMI. My God, it's true. For centuries, people have been talking about worlds within the hollow earth. 18th century writers called it Agharta. It isn't possible. You're looking at it. During the second world war, this part of Antarctica was occupied by Germany. Hitler actually sent expeditions down here looking for the supposed entrance to Agharta at the South Pole. Some people say that this is the site of secret submarine bases. Some people say that this is the center of Nazi UFO research. I'm sorry. How do you know all this? When you lived in Antartica for 10 years, you hear things. Come on. Let's find Paige and Mark. One extreme to the other. Heat and moisture, the elements of life, My Man. It was from an environment like this that the very first Prehistoric Microbes emerged. Come on. We're almost there. We don't know what we're dealing with. We don't know who or.. Or what lives in those buildings. Microbes didn't build them. You hope. No, it's fine. You're right. Safer if you stay here. Paige and Mark are our friends, too. We've come this far, and I'm just not going to... Hey, Silje, you okay? It's okay. Just a little faint. It's the heat. Here. Here. Have some water. Have a little more. I'm okay. Really, it's nothing. Let's just find our friends and get out of here. Why does this look familiar? Because it was built by humans. No, that's not it. You have kept your word, Dr. Reistad. Heil Hitler. What is this? This isn't the first time I've been here. 10 years ago, when I was working the very same site, I was caught and brought here to Neuschwabenland. That was the first time I met Dr. Josef Mengele. Mengele. Who? Dr. Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death, Butcher of Auschwitz. Mengele died in the seventies. That's right. Unicamp exhumed his skull in Brazil. They confirmed it with his DNA. I was 61 years old, suffering from Debilitating Arthritis and Chronic Osteoporosis, but I survived by replacing almost 60% of my Endoskeleton... which in turn stopped my decaying health and kept the world from looking for me. That's not possible. Oh, my dear doctor... Moss. Dr. Moss. You have no idea what is possible once science is liberated from emotion and so called ethics. You mean torturing and murdering innocent people. You must be Dr. Blechman... A Jew. No. I'm.. I'm not religious. No! When the war ended... The Americans and Russians rushed to detain our scientists and doctors and use them for their own purpose, but I managed to liberate the most brilliant minds of the fatherland myself. The most important scientific advances of the Twentieth Century are based on German ingenuity. Over the last 60 years, we've made technical advances that the deviant, Zionist West could only dream about. But there is one task left. We prepare to take back our rightful place as the masters of this world. There are not many of us left. We've been replacing vital organs, recycling them over the years, replacing brittle bones with more permanent materials. Dr. Reistad here kept himself alive by agreeing to deliver a constant stream of quality suitable replacement parts. Adrian? Don't worry. You have been brought here for a different reason. Dr. Reistad tells me that you are all leaders in your fields of research, the best of the best. You are here... To keep us alive... To witness the next greatness, The rise... The coming... Of the thousand year Reich. I'll never help you. So be it. Wait. Paige. We can help them, or we can die. Relax, Lucas. We're not going anywhere. You heard what they're planning. Yeah, what are we supposed to do about it? We get back to Niflheim. We contact McMurdo. Then what? There's no military base in Antarctica. There's an Air Force Base in Auckland. Would you stop that! We are not getting out of here. We have got to do something! What can we do? We're just doctors. Someone'll do something. Are you listening to yourselves? You see what happened to Aaron? We need to save ourselves. Rahul is right. We should do what we're ordered and try to survive, just like Dr. Reistad and.. And Paige. Lucas, there's nothing we can do. This is how it happens. Isn't it? Evil men triumph when good men do nothing. Fine. I'll play along. I'll wait for a chance... But I won't do nothing. We're all gonna die, aren't we? Paige! Mark! Oh, my God, are you okay? That's not Mark. Stay away from her. Stop! This laboratory is the result of my decades of research in Genetics and Organ Transplantation. Everything I have learned, you will find in these files. Everything necessary... To prolong and improve the Aryan Race... Can be found in here. Yet, all my efforts... Have been ephemeral. GVHD. You need MTOR Inhibitors. Yes. Dr. Morgan already suggested this. It proved to be... Imperfect. That's because it isn't a rejection issue. That's the problem with Theoretical Research. You tend to lose sight of the obvious. It may very well be acute rejection, but... The issue here... Is a Nosocomial Infection. There. Now if the patient and his doctors can keep their hands away from the surgical wound without protection, the antibiotics should do the trick. You were right, Dr. Reistad. He may be useful after all. But time... Is still our enemy. I will leave you to your work. Hi. Hey. How's it going? Not so well. Thought you might need this. Herren, come with me. Damen, go with him. And take off your coats! What's going on? We want to stay together. You will be together very soon. Lucas. Where are you taking them? They're only going to the showers. Go. Ausziehen. Strip. No. Nice. No! Leave her alone! Stop! Leave her alone! Just get off of her! Angela! No! Angela! No! Oh, my God. Dr. Reistad. Thank God. What do you think you're doing, May? Huh? What were you and Lucas talking about? Don't you understand What's happening here? The world has no idea of the Juggernaut that's about to be unleashed on it. The only way for us to survive is to align ourselves with the victors. Ja. This one. Take her to the operating room. What? No. No. No. No! May! Stop! No! No! I'm sorry. May! May! Stop! No! No! No! Stop! You did the right thing, Silje. Let's go. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Silje. Silje, are you okay? Silje. Where are Angela and May? Come on. Come on. Oh, my God. Come on. You are about to witness history. May. Dr. Reistad, your assistance, please. Reistad, you're a doctor. How could you do this? I honestly don't know whether you're a hypocrite or naive. Everything we know about the effects of freezing on the body were obtained by human experiments almost exclusively at Dachau and Auschwitz. Yet you have no misgivings about treating the effects of Hypothermia. What's the difference? Reistad, get on with it. Remove him. You said it would work! I said it should. You said... The stem cells were the key! That was only the first time we've tried this. What is wrong with you? You're never squeamish. I'm not. I'm pregnant. Why didn't you tell me? You would have sent me home. Oh, Min Elskede. I'm so sorry. Adrian? Adrian. Aah! Are you sure this will work? Nothing is certain in science, but the regenerative properites of Fetal Stem Cells have been well documented. Adrian. Oh, please don't kill our baby. What are we waiting for? Don't kill our baby! Hurry. Doktor... Mengele. Why do they have us out here? They killed Angela and May. Executions. Something's going on. Fuck... Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Your services are no longer required. Dr. Reistad, Dr. Morgan, prepare for surgery. Paige. Please. I understand you have feelings for Dr. Moss, but there is no place for sentimentalities here. We are about to start a New World Order where only the strong will survive. It has begun. Paige! We must act quickly, the direct sunlight exposure accelerates the deterioration of my skin. Paige, you are pleased with his physical appearance. I understand that, but he is not our blood. But he can be. As you can see, I am in need of new flesh. Lucas flesh will be my flesh. He will become me. No! And we will be together, You and I, side by side. Leaders of the glorious Fourth Reich. Paige! Listen to me! Stop this! I'm sorry. Lucas. I thought I'd lost you. Never. Right. We have to find brian. Let's go. Lucas. No. No, please, please. Please, stop. Please stop! Silje, help me. Please. Dr. Reistad, what are you doing? Please. What are you doing? Please. Please. Silje. Come on. We have to go. No. Let's go. Come on. Lucas, watch out! Paige. Stop! This isn't yours. We've got to get off this ship. Not that way. Reistad went that way. Let's go. R-N-ZED-A-F Base, this is SQ-5. Copy. EQC report unusual seismic activity in your quadrant. Coordinates are 26 degrees West by 33 South. Copy that. R-N-ZED-A-F Base, We'll check it out. Wait! This way. This way. I know this area. We need to get Mark. Mark. Mark. We're gonna get you out of here. No. Kill... Me. No. No. Please. Lucas. Kill me. No. No. Not like that. Thank you, Doctor. Come on. Shit! Captain, I'm getting M.A.D. Readings that show a magnitude 8 seismic event at target coordinates. That's one big earthquake. Sir, there's something still down there. Let's see what it is. Shit a brick! Adrian, no. Reistad! Wait! R-N-ZED-A-f Base Auckland, This is SQ-5. We have visual contact with an unidentified flying object. This thing is huge. SQ-5, this is Auckland Base. We read your UFO. Is target hostile? Target is covered in Nazi Swastikas. I'm calling it hostile. Damn it, Reistad! There must be another way out of here. I think I saw some other doors down the hall. SQ-5, you are clear to engage target. FCO, prepare to launch Mavericks. What now? Stairs. What? Stairway! Go! I'll cover you! Report. Negative. All missiles destroyed. That's impossible. Disengage. Auckland Base, alert Unsar and Ussac. We are under attack. Damn it! What? I'm out. Give me your gun, and I'll cover you. No. No way. Go. Go. Hey! E.M.P.! We've lost all power! Avionics are not responding. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Guys, over here! Wait. The other Americans are escaping. Aah! The flesh eating bacteria, that's what Reistad was doing. They're putting it in the bombs. They're going to infect the planet. We have to stop them. How? Hey, what does this mean? "Rettungsboote." Lifeboats. Thank God. Come on. Run. U.S.S. Ronald Reagan, This is Hornet Leader One. We have visual contact with target. Hornet Leader One, you are free to engage. Destroy 'em all. We have to run for it. I love you. Paige! Hey! You were supposed to leave me. Never. Let's go now. Adrian. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Plan? Yes. And? I'm working on it. Run! Paige, plan? Still working on it. Come on, you bobbleheaded zombie Nazi son of a bitch! Lucas! Ahh! Yes. Mmm. Where do you want to go for our honeymoon? Someplace warm.
