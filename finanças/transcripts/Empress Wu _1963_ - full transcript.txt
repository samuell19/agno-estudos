Ican't believe you said that! How unfilial of you! Mother! If you go to the Empress now you're selling out the prince and those loyal ministers You're still young. Think again! The prince has been kind to us how can you do this to him? You're intelligent how can you sacrifice others for your gain? Mother, what are you saying? How can you sacrifice others for own gain?

Therefore I must avenge her! No wonder you have concealed weapons They're for my benefit! Now that I'm in your hands You can kill me Iike you poisoned my brother! Enough! Your Majesty! Don't be angry! Let me talk to him! Who told you I poisoned your brother? Everybody knows that don't play dumb! You're a cold-blooded murderer! You've gone mad! Sire... You unfilial son, I'll kill you! Don't lose your temper, sire! Lie down and rest! No, while I still can... I must tell him! Your brother overdosed on aphrodisiac! Madam He Lan killed herself because I raped her! Why did you blame your mother? Let me tell you The Empress is none other than your birth mother! When you were born she was still at the nunnery! She gave birth in Madam He Lan's house that's why you came under her care Lie down, sire! You want to kill your own mother! What kind of an animal are you? The nerve of you to boast filial piety! Your Majesty! Let me talk to him! Escort His Majesty to the chamber! Yes His Majesty sets out! Farewell, father! His Majesty sets out! Now you know your mistake? I made no mistake! You don't believe your father? He didn't mean what he said! If he didn't say that he'll be dead! You're perverse! Who instigated you? The gods of Heaven and my conscience! Please spare my father just kill me! My own flesh and blood What can I say? Summon Pei Yan! Yes! Greetings, Your Majesty! Draft an edict at once Banish the prince to Sichuan as a commoner Yes! Go! Yes! Kneel for the lmperial Edict By virtue of the Emperor Since Li Xian cannot restrain his militarism He is banished to Sichuan Yet he's unable to correct his mistakes conspired with traitors spread rumors to create chaos Such behavior is intolerable I hereby order General Qiu to eliminate the instigators and execute him "ln December, 683 A. D. Zhong Zong succeeded Gao Zong as Emperor He was exempted in February and named Prince Lu Ling Empress Wu promulgated the 1 2 Suggestions" Look at Zhang San! He was an informer Commoners riding in a palanquin to the court! That's unheard of! These vagrants... These vagrants were bought off by Zhou Xing and Lai Jun Chen! If they wish to frame someone there'll be informers! Millions of innocent people have died! Hen crow at daybreak like a cock is a bad sign The Turks and Tibetians tyrannized the border Nothing was done to counter their invasion She's suspicious and ruthless by nature She drove her opponents to suicide and killed her own flesh and blood The dynasty built by Emperor Tai Zong will come to an end soon! Shut up! Creating chaos with your fallacies? I didn't! Take him away! Go! What are you doing? I'm innocent... There are 3 petitions today The first one... What is it? This does not warrant your attention! What is it? A request to find a chicken What? Someone from Lizhou His chicken was stolen He wants...this is a joke! By law, the district magistrate should execute him! You think it's appropriate? If Your Majesty attends to such a petty matter there'll be chaos! But I must deal with it! Yes! Draft an edict to the magistrate of Lizhou Arrest the thief in 3 days! Pardon my ignorance, are you serious? You should be beheaded for asking! Yes! My words are decisive Will I make a joke? Reviewing the law No Emperor in history has mobilized resources for something so trivial! Trivial? Theft reflects instability Instability stems from poverty There'll be no thieves if people are contended! You're right! What about the next one? This is absurd! Heavy penalty must be imposed! What is it? There's a Da Zheng Temple in the capital The nuns misbehaved! What's the matter? They defied monastic rules and seduced young men! We must punish them! Is that your law? Are you defending them? I'm just intrigued! About what? These nuns live in seclusion how can they seduce men? Don't you think it's rather strange? Perhaps! Even women should not seduce men Iet alone nuns! Is Your Majesty revising "The Chaste Women"? Yes! You think to make someone... A woman with feelings and thoughts like a man To be kept in a nunnery is considered chaste? My intention for revising the book is the exact opposite! I have identified many heroines throughout history to set an example for women; Urge them to introspect, Iet them enjoy human rights This is against nature! I'm afraid there'll be trouble! What do you mean? Your indiscretion has set a bad example hence the people are unruly! Decent women focus on sewing And not matters that do not concern them! Enough! Honesty is always unpleasant to the ear! In your opinion I'm only qualified to sew? If Your Majesty knows what is proper you should abdicate Prince Lu Ling is the true heir! I see I would like to take your advice but there's one problem! You can surely eliminate it! I'm afraid you'll disagree! I'll die with no remorse! You're most forthright! Guards! Yes! Remove his hat and token! Yes! Thank you! Your Majesty! You can still change your mind! Think carefully! Will you take back what you said? No! You're true to the law! You've upset the yin and yang, violated the legislative intent of our ancestors! I'll show you their intention! Decapitate him! Yes! Wait! Anything to say in your defense? No! Do you believe in the law? I will not yield! Take him away! Yes! Wait! You are pardoned and summoned to the rear chamber! You may go! Yes! Greetings, Your Majesty! Come in! Yes! Greetings, Your Majesty! Are you aware of your crime? No! So you're not afraid to die? A loyal official is not afraid to die! Loyal official? You consider my head not worthy of the blade? Well worth it! What are you looking at? Your eyes and figure and also your heart! Your eyes sparkle but they're not tender You're tall but not stalwart Your lips bend downwards, it shows you have will power You're old fashioned and your heart... I know that now You have courage and you're eager to do well! I like that in a man! What do you mean? You don't understand? No! There's nothing in your law like this Right? I beg you to kill me! No! Right now I don't intend to do that You may all go! Yes! You too, Wan Er! Yes! Your Majesty! If you pardon me please allow me to retire! That'll be such a waste! Look at me! Things don't go by the law around here But don't worry, word will not leak out! Your Majesty! One fire on another Someone in red on the throne Crows across the river, rabbits roll down the hill Everything in vain, no need to go to war One fire on another Someone in red on the throne Dao Sheng Madam Shangguan When did you arrive? A few days ago Have a seat I accompanied Master Shan Dao to perform rituals for the late Emperor I'm here to visit you! You're so thoughtful! Wan Er is in Feng Tian county with the Empress to bury the late Emperor! I know I heard the crown prince was murdered in Sichuan! They say the Empress was behind it! The Empress? I don't think so Towards me and Wan Er she was most lenient! She can't possibly do this! It's hard to say! Have some tea! I have to go! I just came to see you Minister Pei is here. Leave from the back! Alright! Master Luo Madam Shangguan! Please have a seat! Yes! It's safer to meet here No one ever comes here How are things in Yangzhou? All set Lord Ying sent me to fix the date for the uprising! The Empress is in Feng Tian county This is the perfect time! Good! I have the proclamation against the Empress! I brought 2 copies Well written! Thank you! We found someone in Yangzhou who resembles the crown prince! We'll use him to rally the people! That's excellent! Lord Ying wants you to send a few confidants to accompany me to...thank you ... Iiaise When are you leaving? There is not a moment to lose I'll leave tomorrow I'll dispatch my men tonight We'll meet at Tianjun Bridge at dawn Good! No need to go to war This rhyme has implications Kids in the city are singing it They started it last night in court It's the will of Heaven! What? It's time for a new dynasty! According to the rhyme... You're the next Emperor! Why? Listen... One fire on another 2 "fires" is your name "Yan" Someone in red on the throne That's your last name "Pei" Yes! Crow represents the sun, rabbit is the moon Everything in vain That's the word "Zhao", the Empress' name! No need to go to war That's the Empress' last name, Wu Exactly! Looks like Wu will yield to Pei Honestly, that has been my intention! I appointed General Cheng to the capital precisely for this reason! It appears you'll get your wish! Let me salute the future Emperor! Rise! Madam, I'll leave the proclamations with you! You'll be rewarded for keeping this secret Thank you! It's settled then! Let's go! Please stay! You're still here? Sorry, I overheard everything! You... I must alert the Empress You are traitors! I must report you Dao Sheng Let go! I'm coming with you What? I must report them I finally understand I thought Pei Yan was loyal to Tang but he's just an usurper! I misjudged you! Feng Tian county is too far from here You can't possibly go! Let me go! Place Pei Yan under house arrest Order General Li to execute Cheng Wu Ting Then lead 300,000 troops down south on a pre-emptive strike Take Xu Jing Ye by surprise! Your Majesty! Rise! Rise! Thank you! Pei Yan You colluded with Xu Jing Ye in an uprising and caused great sufferings Do you admit to being guilty? I'm loyal to the Tang Dynasty I'm on a punitive expedition to restore the Tang. How can I be guilty? Is he a loyal official? You think you're loyal to Tang but everyone knows You bribed General Qiu And murdered the crown prince with a fake edict! You call that 'loyal'? The Li descendants are inept and deserved to die! I have the mandate from Heaven to be the Emperor! Mandate from Heaven? Just listen to the children's rhyme that's spread across the palace! Luo Bin Wang Yes! About that rhyme tell us all about it! Xu Jing Ye plotted against Your Majesty He wanted Pei Yan to help him So I spread the rhyme to deceive him! Did you hear that? The winner is king, the loser a bandit It serves me right to be duped by him! We have witnesses and evidence What can you say for yourself? Do with me as you please! Very well! You're most forthright! Guards! Yes! Decapitate him and Xue Zhong Zhang! Yes! What about you? I deserve to die You should be executed for conspiracy! But you exposed the scheme with your rhyme And helped wipe out the traitors! Did you write the proclamation? Death is too good for me! You write well but you have no moral integrity I banish you to Ling Yin Temple for introspection Take him away! I'll never forget your benevolence! The riot is suppressed and the traitors executed We should celebrate Long live Your Majesty! Long live Your Majesty! "September, 690 A. D. Tang Dynasty became Zhou Empress Wu called herself Sacred Emperor" What is it? Nothing! Someone set fire to the Ming Hall! Zhang Chang Zong and Zhang Yi Zhi barged in with rebel troops! Who set the fire? I don't know! Go put it out! Don't just stand there! Oh, right! Your Majesty! There's nothing to be afraid of! I'll suppress them, it'll be over! But... I expected them to come after me Just not this soon! Let's take shelter! No! I'll wait for them! Let them see who I am! And let them know who they are! The situation is bad! Zhang Chang Zong and Zhang Yi Zhi have rebelled Please hurry and make a decision! On what? I knew this day would come According to your laws? Yes and no! Since Xu Jing Ye's rebellion you've been discredited You think I haven't killed enough? Precisely because of the killing You trusted Zhang Chang Zong and Zhang Yi Zhi Zhou Xing and Lai Jun Chen but they oppressed the people! Your reputation has been tarnished! Wan Er, is my head still intact? Yes! If it is you have nothing to fear! I can still dispose them! I say yes, they dare not say no! I want them dead they dare not stay alive! You know how to control people but it's different now! How so? You're advanced in years, you should abdicate What? This is a pressing matter! The Zhangs are searching the palace! You think they dare to kill me? You're wrong! They wouldn't dare! I'll vanquish them! But should something happen Your Majesty should have an heir! Who should that be? Prince Lu Ling You think I'll die? Zhang Chang Zong Zhang Yi Zhi to see Your Majesty! Has the fire been put out? We caught the arsonist! Who is it? One of my men! Who is it? Xue Huai Yi He should be executed! Please issue the order! Or else even though we recognize Your Majesty Our swords do not! How dare you! You should be executed for insulting me! How impudent of you! Okay then, let me ask you What should be done to the one who rebelled? If insulting an official should be punishable by death what about the one who plotted against the Emperor? We wouldn't dare! No? You charged in here with your men Didn't you come for my head? We wouldn't dare! Then what are your swords for? To protect Your Majesty! For my protection? Will you execute the rebels? Yes! Zhang Chang Zong and Zhang Yi Zhi are accusing you! Will you kill yourselves? We wouldn't dare! Then... Have mercy, Your Majesty! Among the most calculating senior ministers Pei Yan comes to mind Among the most popular generals Xu Jing Ye is the one Among the most invincible generals One must count Cheng Wu Ting What happened to them? Why are you bringing them up? Because they had sensible heads that were worth decapitating! But sensible heads like that are hard to come by these days! Your Majesty! I shall reward you for putting out the fire Thank you, Your Majesty! You may go! Thank you! Even minions like them want to revolt! They have committed high treason why didn't you execute them? They're not worth it! You should get some rest! I might not wake up again! Your Majesty! I won't die! I'll vanquish them! Summon Wu Cheng Si He's... What? He's in Fangzhou to bring Prince Lu Ling back to court! Your Majesty! You may all go! Please let me rest here alone for a while Go! Usurper Wu Zhao is not of amicable disposition She comes from humble origin and attended to Emperor Tai Zong Shamed the palace with her promiscuity Meddled with state affairs Unyielding and overbearing Bewitched the Emperor with slander Ruthless and ferocious Resorted to sorcery to slaughter the innocent including her own siblings Incurring the wrath of both man and God! Enough! I forbid you to laugh!
