A Japan Video Distribution Production In Co-operation with Space Elephant Yoko Satomi Shiina Nagamuri Kana Sakurai GIRL HELL 1999 Check that out. What kind of guy do you think rides in that? We can be damn sure he's no honest person. You think so? Are you going tonight too? For this? I'm not going. Why the hell not? Tomomaru Murai Yuusuke Kimura Eh? What... Well, let me just ask you this. Do you have any romantic experience? What's that? What are you talking about? Ordinary stuff, like taking a girl out on a date. Oh, you mean like going to see a movie, or things like that? Yeah. Of course not! I knew it. Shit like that is such a pain in the ass. I can't understand why a guy would get hung up on one girl. It's best to bang as many chicks as possible! I'm tired of rape already. Natsumi Harada Kazuhiro Sano So then, you don't even care whether it's an old hag, or a middle school girl? Nope, not at all. You're a fucking pervert. That last one looked like she had to have been in her fifties... That's the beauty of it. It's easier to have my way with them when they lack the strength to resist. Are you an idiot? Does it really matter? You just stick your dick in; there are no big differences between any chicks. Man, I can't believe you! Even if I'm about to fuck an old hag, I just picture the face of that Hirose girl in my mind, and then I can get it up, no problem. My friend, I think the problem is you lack imagination. Taishi Takemoto Go Okuno Salmon Sakeyama I want to lead a more happy and fulfilling life, while I'm still young. What are you talking about? You've done horrible things up till now. I know. That's why I want to stop and live a more honest life from now on! Are you sure you're alright? You're acting weird, Kenji. You're the one who's weird. No, there's something really wrong with you man. Oh, I get it. So have you fallen in love with some girl? For real!? Well, tell me about her. Written and Directed by Daisuke Yamanouchi You're so cute! Babara... ("baba" = "hag") I've brought something for you. Hey, Haruko, you eat some too. This is no good. Haruko, you're staying a little baby, no matter how much time passes. Alright, fine. Do you want to have some milk? Go on - drink a whole bunch. Hey, don't spill it! You're so pretty. Hey, don't stare at me like that! Um, do you mind if I keep that? Huh? Um, I'm referring to that tissue you're using right now. Can I have it? Fine, but it's gonna cost you. Eh? But you were gonna throw it away anyway, weren't you? That's true. But if a guy tells me he wants it, I would be stupid not to sell it. Alright, I understand. How much? An extra 2,000 Yen. Um, I'm a 17 year old girl looking to do some enjo. (enjo kousai = compensated dating) Er, I have long hair, and I'm a little bit chubby. We'll decide on the price after we meet in person. Okay then, I'm waiting for you to contact me. Misaki! What have you been doing all this time? I was by the river side. You were at Babaras place again? Yeah. She's totally bat-shit crazy. I had a lot of extra bread, so I took it to her. Look, I finally bought it. Wow, that's really nice. I knew it! It's different when you're actually using it. Don't you think the difference comes from the material? Well, never mind. What's up with you? What happened to your bike? I parked it and someone stole my seat. Where did you park it? At school? No, under the bridge. But why would somebody steal something like that? There are a lot of ways in which it could be used. Since it belongs to a cute girl like you, Misaki. Eh? A weird guy's been hanging around lately... I have to be careful myself too. Oh, so you've come home? How about at least saying I'm home to your father? Hey, don't ignore me. Are you doing that shit again, you crazy girl? Sister! Are you alright? Sister! Sister! Sister. Your old school uniform looks really good on Keiko, doesn't it? Hey, Misaki... What, sister? I bet you think I deserve this. You're happy about what's happened to me, aren't you? Sister, why are you saying that? I care about you. Then why don't you help me... when that man is doing horrible things to me? I know why: you're scared. You don't want him to do it to you. So you just stay quiet and let him do with me as he pleases. That's not true. You've always been the same way. I was prettier than you, and better at studying, so Mom loved me the most. You were always jealous of me, weren't you? Stop! I bet you feel really good, now that I've ended up like this. Stop, sister! Stop, sister! Misaki? Misaki? Hmph, so she feeds a homeless woman? Be careful with your choice of words, fool. What? Say 'volunteer'! Volunteer! It's 'volunteers', not 'feeds'! Whatever, isn't it all the same? What are you doing? It's 'volunteer'! Say it! I got it! Volunteer! Volunteer! She has a reputation for being a really nice girl in the neighborhood. Some years ago, her mom ran out on her. Right now, it seems she's living with just her dad and sister. Her sister was involved in a traffic accident or something. She survived, but it seems she's become a hideous monster. - A monster? - Yeah. What do you mean? She's bed-ridden and she can't leave the house, so few people have ever actually seen her, but I've heard she has horrible scars all over her body. Wow! Yeah, and she's bed-ridden, so she just shits and pees her pants. The younger sister has to deal with that too. I'm a bit impressed. What? It's nothing. I've been thinking I can't just keep living like this. A real man would help a girl like her, who's having a lot of problems. If I start going out with that girl, I can make amends for all that I've done. I'll work honestly and make her happy. Don't you think she's waiting for just such a guy to show up? You don't really think so, do you? I do! I do! I'm sure she is! Look: Harukos all cleaned up. Here you go. That's good. You're a good mother for Haruko. You're so cute! You're so cute! You're so cute! You're so cute! Stop it now! Misaki, what is your intention? Stop it! I'll stab you! What is your intention? Pointing that knife at your father... Do you understand what you're doing? Are you really gonna stab me? You're gonna stab your own father? A scumbag like you is no father of mine! I am your father! Then how could you do such horrible things to me and my sister!? Would you guys even have survived without me? Huh? Would you have survived? You're so fucking ungrateful! I'm the one who's taken care of you guys since you were abandoned by that woman! Didn't you point the knife at the wrong person? Point the knife at that woman who abandoned you and your sister to run off with a young guy! That's not true! She left because she was afraid! She thought she was gonna end up being killed by you! She couldn't help but leave! Fine... then why did her co-worker disappear at the same time? Huh? I was utterly disgraced. People called me the stupid guy who's wife eloped. That woman ran away. From me, from her girls, from everything! She abandoned us all to run off with a young man! Don't you ever try this sort of thing again. Next time... I will kill you. Um, excuse me. Excuse me. Um, here. Take this. Wow. So he wrote "come to Ichino bridge after school"? Yeah. How nice. You pretty girls are so popular. This is a problem for me. It'll be fine! You're already 17 years old. You should at least have a boyfriend. I think it'll brighten up your life for sure. Well? So what was he like? Cool? I'm not sure. I didn't get a good look at him. Won't anything good ever happen for me? Nothing ever goes my way. I'd be better off dead! Yes? Yes, that's right. Uhm, I want to be paid at least 15,000 yen. Eh? Is that fine with you? Thank you so much! Uh, well then, let's meet at the parking lot on Nagasakiya. It'll be okay. I'll come wearing it. Sorry, I've got some work. See you tomorrow. See? She's not gonna show up. I told you it was impossible. A girl that lovely can't be wooed by the likes of you. Give it up. Maybe she couldn't even read what you wrote her... because your hand writing's so shitty! I'm deeply wounded right now. Hey, stop man! It's no use taking out your anger on me! Alright, I've got it! We'll get revenge! We'll pay her back in spades! So let me down, man! Go on, Haruko! Drink a whole bunch! Fuck her up. What's that? Lemme see it! Haruko! Haruko! Don't touch me, you dirty bitch! You're fucking insane! Haruko! Scum like you really make me furious! This is filthy! What have you done, bitch?! You really are a fucking pervert. Um, are you Misaki Tsukamoto? I'm sorry. It seems I've startled you. I'm Nakahara, from the prefectural education committee. Is your mother here? No, she's not... When will she be back? Um, my mother doesn't live here. Oh, well then, excuse me. Don't worry about it. Can I have a little bit of your time? Eh? It's about a scholarship. - At my home? - Yes. Uhm, that's not a good idea. There's a sick person in the house. Oh, I'm sorry - I didn't know. Don't worry too much. Okay. Well, my car's parked right over there - we can talk inside. I'll make it brief. So... say what you've got to say. I have several things to apologize for. First of all, I'm not somebody from the education committee. This is so annoying... I don't want any newspapers! Who the fuck are you guys? I have no intention of harming you. Muraki, give me the thing. Yes. It was a huge inconvenience, wasn't it? I'll give it back to you. And, you can have this. It's my way of apologizing. What is the meaning of this? You have only your little sister to blame for this. You monster! It's embarrassing to say this, but I've been entranced by your beauty... from the first moment I laid eyes on you. So that's why I couldn't control my feelings. Um, I'm afraid I can't accept this. No. Please take it. I've done an awful thing to you. No, it's unnecessary. You've already given me back what is mine. I stripped that off your bike. You probably hate me for it. Fuck yeah! Well, how's her ass? It's wet, and very hot! It's okay already. I don't understand you, but just don't do it anymore. And I really must give this back to you. No, I want you to have it, no matter what. Even if you don't really need it for yourself, spend a bit of the money on your sister. How do you know about my sister!? Sorry, I've investigated your background. I know all about your sister and father. You need to move out and get away from that man as soon as possible! If you don't mind, I'll help you out! I don't want help from a weirdo like you! Excuse me. Open it! Muraki... Sister? Sister? Somebody! Somebody! What's the matter? Sister! Sister's dead! Sister's... It's gonna be okay. Relax. Let me go! Hey there, remember me? Yo man, you sure she's alright? Say something! Come on! How do you feel about this? If you're upset, then scream! Gimme one good scream! Do you want to drink my piss? Eh? Why? What the hell is she saying? There's no more left. What are you talking about?! Fuck! This isn't enough to get me going! Resist me at least a little bit! I can't get a hard-on like this! Start acting like you hate it! Try and resist me! Fuck! I can't get it up! That's enough, Kenji. It's no use. Unless you're holding down a screaming, struggling woman, you can't get a hard-on. Mother... Mother... Mother? Mother? What's wrong? It's me! Mother. Where's Haruko? What happened to Haruko!? Mother, are you doing this again? Are you going to abandon us again? That's so selfish! It's too selfish! Do you like that guy so much?! Is he more important to you than us?! Why? Why are you always abandoning us? Do you hate me that much!? I thought we had an agreement. I promised I'd be a good girl! I've been... very well behaved! Why? Why? Mother! Mother! Mother! Haruko. Haruko.
