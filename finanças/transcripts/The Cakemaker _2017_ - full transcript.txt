The Cakemaker Kredenz Cafe & Bakery Good morning. - Good morning. Hello. How are you? Good, and you? - Good, thank you. Every time I come to Berlin, this is the first place I visit because of your cookies. Thank you. You're welcome. What do you recommend today? Here we have a raisin pastry on the left, and we have poppy seed pastries, but you don't like those. True. This is a classic Black Forest cake here in the middle. Should I explain in English? - No. I trust you. I'll take this one, a double espresso, and a box of your cinnamon cookies. Cinnamon cookies. - My wife loves them. You may sit. - Thank you. Here you go. - Thank you. For your wife. - Thank you. Is everything okay? Yes, thank you. Can I ask you something? My son in Israel has a birthday and I don't have a clue what to get him. Do you have an idea for a typical German present? How old is your son? -6 years old. What are you doing here in Berlin? I work for an Israeli-German company. City planning, trains. I know a toy store that specializes in trains from steel, they build and paint them by hand. Maybe you get him a small train. That's a good idea. Maybe you can come with me? It would be nice to be guided by a real Berliner. I'm not a real Berliner, but... sure, I can take you there. ONE YEAR LATER Tai Tai! Yes, sweetie, it's your father. How are you? Yes? How was school today? Are you a good boy? Not causing your mother any trouble? I'll be back on Thursday. I'll pick you up from school, and we'll go for pizza. Okay, sweetie, me too.

I'm looking for Oren. Is he here? I'm from "Cafe Kredenz," I must deliver this. Oren isn't here. Where is he? He doesn't work here anymore. Did he quit? He ordered this, and I was in the area so I wanted to give it to him. I just want to know where he is. Please. I can't really talk about this. There was an accident in Jerusalem, his office told us almost six weeks ago. That's all we know. Oren was killed. Sweetheart You're not cold anymore? Change of personal status, Married / Divorced...

Have a good week and a good month. Thanks. I'd offer you coffee, but I still didn't clean the machine... I already had one. - Okay. Good luck. - Thanks. Goodbye. Cafe Paamon is hereby approved Kosher Hello. Hebrew Youth Swimming Pool I'm off. There is soup on the stove, take it off in ten minutes. Are you picking Itai up at 13:00?

Could you pick Itai up at 13:00? Oh... Okay. I'll manage. I'll close for an hour or something. Okay. Alright. So I'll see you later. Bye. Hey. How are you? - Okay. Yeah? Let me see you. Listen, Aviva caught me on the way out. She said he's shutting himself off. Maybe you should talk to her. Fine. Who's that? A student, he works here. Where is he from? - He's German. Of all the places in the world, you bring a German into your kitchen? Two phone calls and I could find you ten new workers. What do you want? It works for me. What's the problem? He's German. Come on, stop it, he's right here, that's not nice. - It's okay, he doesn't hear us. I'll see you. - Okay, thank you. Here you go. Did you get any homework? What is he doing? Anat, he can't use the oven, it's forbidden. I know, we won't sell those. If Avram sees this, your cafe is finished, Anat. I know. Come, I want to talk to you outside. Yes? Is he alright? What do you mean? Where is he? What do you mean, you don't know where my son is? Excuse me, can I have a cappuccino? A cappuccino, please. Shabbat! Shabbat! Good morning, Anat. How are you doing, Avram? - Thank God. Is that the German? - Yes. Nice to meet you. Since when do you sell cookies? - We've only just started. How is Itai? Thank God. Very nice, Anat. See you, folks. - See you. Let's go. Shabbat candle-lighting time is at 16:27. 16:27. Good Shabbos. Good Shabbos. - Good Shabbos. Hurry up, dinner is ready. Do you want to say the blessing? Yes. We don't have to. Yes. - Okay. Sit nicely. Together? - Yes. "The sixth day. And the heavens and the earth and all their hosts were completed. "And God finished by the Seventh Day His work, "and He rested on the Seventh Day from all His work. "And God blessed the Seventh Day and made it holy, "for on it He rested from all His work. "Blessed are you, Lord, our God, "Sovereign of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine." Amen. Say "Amen." Amen. Where does he live? Where does he live? Now he lives here, but he came from Germany. Where is his mother? I don't know. He doesn't have a mother, he grew up with his grandmother. Where is his father? -Enough, you're asking too many questions. If he doesn't want to answer, he doesn't have to. He doesn't want to answer. Okay. - Okay? Itai, Thomas made it himself! Look at this cake. Would you like some? No. How come? Motti told me not to eat what Thomas bakes. Really? - Yes. Is that what he said? - Yes. You don't have to listen to everything your uncle says. You should try it, it's very good. Want to eat the cream at least? The white part isn't forbidden. Okay. Okay? Thank you. What's up? Do you have a minute? - Shoot. Why don't you answer my calls? Sorry, but you see how it is here. I thought you'd come for Shabbat. Did you tell Itai not to eat Thomas' food? Yes, I don't want him to eat non-Kosher food. And I don't want him to be afraid of eating, Kosher or not. Forget Itai, think about the cafe. You employ a non-Jewish worker, people talk, you'll lose your Kosher certificate. Thanks to him, I have an order for 60 people. People come here to eat his cakes, not mine. I don't bake. Enough with this Kosher issue. - Lower you voice, people can hear. So let them hear. I'm not religious and I don't want to be religious. Get off my back. Rebbe Nachman of Breslomr - Healing the Heart Kredenz Cafe & Bakery We will take two boxes of the yellow apples. Two boxes?
