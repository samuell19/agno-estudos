But l'm warning you, if you don't start acting like a human being, if you keep partying instead of studying, l won't be your mother anymore! l didn't want to look for you, but l was sure your conscience would bring you here. But what happened between us was crucial, l'm pregnant! You don't seem too happy. - No, but it's an unexpected surprise for me. But what happened can't be changed. We're both responsible. Of course. l'll come by to see you tomorrow. Bye. ls something the matter, Avi? - Yes, l'll tell you. l have to tell someone. l can't tell my mother. l'll help you. l'm in a fix, Sarit. -Tell me, my darling, you can trust me. What's the problem? A girl? - Yes. l met a girl named Batya. We fell in love, we had sex. l got her pregnant. Sarit, what kind of father would l be? You know l live off my mother. Help me, as if l were your son. - My son? Sarit, l love you, but becoming a father in this situation? You know l live off my father. No, Sarit, no. - You two-timed me! Sarit! Sarit! No! No one will touch my son! There's no point in waiting. He doesn't even care. What can l do? No one will protect me. -The law will. l don't want a scandal, court cases, the police. l still trust his conscience. Waiting for him will be like waiting for the Messiah. He won't come here. Go over to his house. No, l'm ashamed. - Then at least call him. Hello? Yes, this is the Danieli residence. Avi? Who's speaking? One moment. -ls that for me? - lt's a girl for you. You promised you stopped all this business. l'm keeping my promise, l don't want to see anyone. -Good. He's not at home, please don't call here anymore. His mother. Don't call anymore. Understand? Why are you so pale? What did she say? She said he's not there. l heard her talking to him. He doesn't want to take any calls. You must go over there and tell his mother everything. Even threaten them. Scare them. Yes, l guess l have no other choice. Let's go. Like l told you before, don't let her see my mother. - Ok, Avi. Hello. - Hello. You must be Batya. - Yes, l am. Nice to meet you. Come, l'd like to talk to you alone. l work here, Avi told me everything. l'm asking you to refrain from meeting his mother. What crime have l committed that l can't meet his mother? Don't worry, you can count on me like a mother. My mother died when l was a little girl. My father married another woman who wasn't very nice to me. Then he sent me here, as if to study. But what will l do? lt's a disgrace. lt is sad, but l'll take care of you. Thank you. l hope l can trust you. Now go and wait patiently. You can trust me, it'll be Ok. Thank you so much. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Well, what did she say? - She has complete trust in me. You're wonderful. You'll get rid of this burden for me. You'll never get rid of it. - What did you say? She just agreed and left. She agreed, but l don't. You don't? This is your love for me? Believe me, l only want what's good for you. Then what should l do? - Get married. -Married? Out of the question. Are you crazy? Firstly, you know l take my studies very seriously. How will l support a wife? With my mother's money? lf you admit it yourself, why did you run away from her? You know she's a lonely girl. You made a mistake, you must pay for it. Ok, Ok, shut up. l'm sick of your advice. Don't stick your nose in my business anymore, understand? You're wasting away here. And he doesn't give a damn about you. l'd rather die. - Are you crazy? l have only one hope: Sarit. She promised me. You're so naive. All l'm asking you is for justice. Who do you think you are? l told you to mind your own business. ls that clear? l won't keep my mouth shut. - Meaning? lf l keep my mouth shut, l'm a partner in crime. My conscience won't allow me to do so. Get off my back. l'll get you fired. Good morning, Mom. - Good morning, my darling. l'm going. - No breakfast? l'm not hungry. - Take a little something. Bye. - Bye. -Avi. Think about what we spoke about. - Again? l warned you. You won't stop till l make you stop. l don't know what's wrong with my son. -He's hiding something. Probably. -Miss Dina, may l go into town today? You went out yesterday. l want to buy something. - Ok. -Thank you. l have to wait for the seamstress anyway. Sarit, is that you? - Hello, Batya. Every time you come, you bring me something. lt's my pleasure. You know that l care for you as if you were my daughter. May l call you Mom? - Of course, dear. l've waited for years to hear that word. Oh, Mom, if only l had a home, l'd want you to live with me. You'll have a home, Batya, and everything will be Ok. You really think so? - l'm sure of it. Avi is a good guy. He's just afraid of his mother, he's insecure. So there's still hope. With a little patience, everything will work out. Mom, l love him! Miss Dina, l found the watch. - Oh, good. Guess where. -Where? - ln Sarit's clothes. That's all l need. Sarit, come here. - Yes, Miss Dina. The drama of the lonely woman. Loyalty. That's what l get for entrusting my home to a woman like you. What are you talking about? - Miss Dina's gold watch, l found it among your rags. lt's a lie! lt's a lie! Miss Dina, don't believe her. How dare you? You scoundrel! You shut up! - Silence. l've known my seamstress for years. She wouldn't lie to me. l should notify the police, but l won't. Now pack your things and get out of my house. And you, come with me. Hello. lt's Sarit! Please come in. Hello, how are you? - We're fine. And you? A misunderstanding between Avi and me. l had to leave. Sit down. Don't worry. This is your home, too. Stay with us. - Thank you. l understand that bastard gave you a hard time, too. l told you not to keep quiet. We'll sue him! No need to sue him. All we need is patience. l ran out of patience. Mira is right, we have no choice. But you need proof. Do we have any? But justice is with us. We have nothing to fear. What if we lose? We'll embarrass Batya in front of everyone. You're not kids. lt's love, you both wanted it. Yes, but he used me and l'm scared. Help me, Mom! -Batya. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Lift your leg. Two three, four. Your arms too. Do as l say. One, two, three, four. Excuse me, ma'am, who are you looking for? - May l speak with the director? Yes, go ahead. - Thank you. With your arms? Yes, ma'am. - Sorry to disturb you? Hurry up, what do you want? - l? l'm an actress. Do you have something for me? No, l'm sorry. - But l have lots of experience. l'm Sarit. Remember me? l used to be very famous. Sarit? l'm sorry, no. -Doesn't the name Sarit mean anything to you? Oh, yes, of course, Sarit, yes? But to be honest, the public has already forgotten you. Nowadays, all they want is sex. Take my advice. Look for another profession. C'mon, keep going, Ok, from the top. What's your name? Sarah, c'mon, livelier! C'mon. Three, four and... Everyone together. Harder, harder, c'mon! What are you doing? -You have nothing to worry about. l'll be right back. Look, it'll take another month. No need for any medicine, l'll prescribe her some vitamins. She needs to eat well. Vegetables, meat, cheese. That's it. l'll see her again next week. Ok, thank you, doctor. Batya, why are you crying? Because of you. How can you cover all these expenses? Don't worry, for you l have everything. Director, she doesn't want to stand in the rain. -Who? -Me. l mean, she. -Why? -She's afraid of catching a cold. Dear God, these actresses! Yosef, l have an idea. Go pick one of the stand-ins and dress her in her clothes. - Me? -Go on, l'm telling you. No way! -Yes. lris, let's go. Schlimazel! -Write. For God's sake, what did they bring me? Scarecrows, stand-ins, look at these faces! l'm going crazy! This director doesn't know what he's doing! l'm losing my mind! l'm going home, right now! l quit! Dear God! Look at them. Stand in a line, straight! What about you? Straight! Oh, no! Oh, no, no! Oh, look down! Oh, no. Oh, no. So serious! Oh, no! Come here. Wait a minute. Don't move!

Batya, hello. - Hello. l know you left me with my conscience, but now l regret it. l admit that the child is mine. And you're my wife. So you admit it? - Yes. Will you sign a paper that says you are the father? Absolutely. - Sit down. Sit down! Write. - Ok, this is what l'll write: "l, Avraham Danieli?" - Ok. "Hereby confirm... "that the child born to Batya Levinson is my son. Period." Sign it. - Avraham Danieli. Anything else? - Let me have that. lf you want them, what will you live on? -My mother has a lot. And what do you have? - Me? Nothing. How will you support a wife and child? Listen, Avi, come back when you can support them. Now, get out! -What? You're driving me away? -Exactly. What are you waiting for? l don't get it. Who are you to be giving orders out? ln this house, l'm everything. And Batya has no right here? - No, l make the decisions. l came to say that l'm sorry. l came to stay, not leave. l'm willing to get married right now. -Out! Batya. -l said out! -Batya, don't listen to her! -Out! Batya, don't listen to her! What did you do to me? -lt's Ok, l know how to deal with him. What more do you want of him? l want him to be a man, to support you and your son. That's all we needed. How did you get into this mess? l want to get married. That girl won't set foot in this house. But Mom, l have a son. - Don't you worry about that. l'll raise him. You forgot that you promised your father you'd marry Tsipi. Tsipi. -l will not permit this marriage, is that clear? Yossi, he hasn't come home in a few days. Do you know where he is? Really? No, that's Ok. l'll go over there myself. Thanks, Yossi. Avi. - Mom. Have you gone crazy? You know that everything l own is yours. Thanks, but l don't need it, leave me alone. l have two hands and a good brain. l'm going back to work. Yes, Mrs. Danieli. l'll go over to see her at once. No, that's Ok. l'll talk to Batya myself. No, no, she'll come. l promise you, Mrs. Danieli. You're welcome. Goodbye. l expected to see her, not you. l came instead of her. Tell me what you wanted to tell her. l hope we can get along. - So do l. Avi is engaged to another girl. A relative of ours who's like a daughter to me. l won't forsake this girl. l'm even willing to pay her a monthly allowance. And l'll raise the child. You can't buy them with money. l see there's no understanding between us. But let me make one thing clear: No one will take Avi away from me. l'm his mother. Does someone want to take him away from you? lf he listens to you and marries her, just as l raised him, l can destroy him, too. l know you can destroy him with one word. That you aren't? That l'm what? - That you aren't his mother. How do you know? l know, that's all. Does he know, too? - Of course not. Don't worry, he won't find out. He's your son; you're his mother Only if he listens to me. lf he doesn't? l hope you're happy. - Yes, thank you. Here's my first salary. For my son and wife. - Avi? Batya, Sarit was right to drive me away. l went and worked. l sweated to earn this money. Now you can't drive me away from here. l did what you wanted. This is my son, and Batya is my wife. -No, Avi. Please, don't stand in our way. What else could you want from me? l want you to be happy. But you can't get married without your mother's consent. Something will happen that you won't be able to take. l don't care what she says. The wedding will take place only with your mother's consent. Enough with these problems. - l said no, and that's it! Tell us, what is the reason? lt's becoming unsettling, even scary. As if there's a secret that you don't want to reveal. l can't tell you. l don't care. We're getting married and that's it. l'm not listening to anyone. Batya, get ready, and leave all the arrangements to me! "Every night l whispered a prayer to the stars: "May the girl l love be my bride "My friends say there is no truth in the stars "Stars only lie, don't believe them "My friends say there is no truth in the stars "Stars only lie, don't believe them "Every single night l whispered to the stars "That l finally want someone who l love to come to me "My friends say there is no truth in the stars "Stars only lie, don't believe them "My friends say there is no truth in the stars "Stars only lie, don't believe them "Tonight the stars lit up your house "We love again. - l'm finally with you "My friends say there is truth in the stars "Stars don't lie if we believe "My friends say there is truth in the stars "Stars don't lie if we believe "Every night we'll whisper a prayer to the stars: "May we always love the way we did in the beginning "My friends say there is truth in the stars "Stars don't lie if we believe "My friends say there is truth in the stars "Stars don't lie if we believe." Hello, Mrs. Danieli. l want to talk to you. l hope you came to give him your blessing. l came to tell him the truth. Mrs. Danieli, please, don't destroy his life. Don't turn his joy into sorrow. l'll tell him in front of everyone that l'm not his mother He can go look for his real mother in some dump. And he can forget about the inheritance. Do you think that's what he cares about? Telling him the truth is what will tear him apart. Why do you care so much about it? -l care. Because l am... - You're what? His mother. Yes, l'm his mother. - His mother? -Yes. l'm his real mother. Mrs. Danieli, l beg you not to ever tell him. Why do you want to ruin the paradise you created for him? He belongs to you more than he belongs to me. You raised him and educated him and took care of him. You didn't sleep at nights because of him. You brought him this far, he's your son. And l? What have l ever done for him? All l did was give birth to him. You did everything for him. Please, go in to see them. Give them your blessing. See how happy they will be. l promise l'll take your secret with me to the grave. Go inside, for your sake, too. Let me see you together one last time, and you'll never see me again. Everyone's here. l wonder where ldo is. Avi! Your mother. - Mom! "Soon you will be alone again "You'll be all alone again, on the side "Without the spotlights, without the applause "And then, suddenly, the curtain went down "And you'll walk off the bright stage "And you'll take off your costly dress "There's no way back to the stage "And only your heart weeps, and there's no choice "Soon you'll be alone again "Without a cheering crowd, all alone, on the side "Because you didn't think about what would happen now "You threw all your happiness away "And you'll walk off the bright stage "And you'll be nameless again "There's no way back to the stage "And only your heart weeps, and there's no choice." - Sarit - English: Suzy De Lowe Subtitles: Elrom Studios
