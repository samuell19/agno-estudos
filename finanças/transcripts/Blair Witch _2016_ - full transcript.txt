[Heather screaming] [grunting] [thunder crashes] [Heather panting heavily] [shrieks] [tape stops] - [James] Did you see her? - [Lisa] What do you mean? I-- [James] I missed it the first time, too. Hang on. [tape rewinding] [Lisa] Okay. What is that? Lisa, I think that might be my sister. [Lisa] Wait, wait, okay. Uh... How did you even find it? Did you have, like, a search alert set up? Yeah, yeah, exactly. And usually, it's nothing. But the guy who uploaded this video said it was from a tape he found in the Black Hills Woods. But those woods have been searched, right? - They never found the house. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, but the Black Hills Forest is huge. So maybe they weren't looking in the right place, you know? That's why I want us to start where the tape was found. - So we can set up camp at night-- - Lisa. - [Lisa] Hi. ' [James] Hey What are you guys doing? We're doing Lisa's documentary class project, starring me. [Peter] Boring! [chuckles] [Lisa] Okay, so try on that earpiece camera. Wh-- which is... - Is it this one? - Yes. And then press the button on the side. - [James] Okay. - [Lisa] And then it should be recording. The cool thing about these is they've got built-in GPS. - [James] Huh? - [Lisa chuckles] How's that? [laughs] You're getting more of these for Peter and Ashley, right? Yeah. We just have to make sure we remember to switch out the cards. [James] Okay. Temp narration take one-- Take two-- Three. When James was four years old, his older sister disappeared while making a documentary near the town of Burkittsville, Maryland. Some of the footage shot by James' sister was later found. The final moments of it showed her going into a house, seemingly within the Black Hills Forest. [screaming] [thudding] [dogs barking] That area was extensively searched by police and FBI, but they could find no evidence of an existing house in those woods. Investigators concluded that James' sister might have vanished elsewhere, despite her crew's equipment and footage being found nearby. For as long as I've been friends with James, he's wondered what happened to her. His continued search to find closure and answers to his sister's disappearance is the subject of this documentary. How long have you and James been friends? [Peter] Our parents were friends, so I guess we grew up together. [Lisa] So you knew him when his sister disappeared? Yeah. I don't really remember Heather all that well, to be honest. But after she went off into those woods and she didn't come back... Yeah. I remember all that. [Peter] Okay, I'm trying to prove a point. That's why you're about to die. [James] Found one. That's me. You're shooting me. - [Lisa] Peter... - [both laughing] [Lisa] Can you give us an idea of what we're going to be doing out there? Four of us, we're gonna go out there and we're gonna try to find this house. James, he's been messaging with the guy who uploaded that video. He's gonna show us exactly where in the woods he found the DV tape. [Lisa] And James, you think you're gonna find the house? Um, maybe. I hope so. [Lisa] So you really think your sister could still be out there after all these years? All I know is... if there is any chance at all that I could find out what happened to her, I need to at least try. [Lisa] And what about the legends? IILegendSllf-P [Lisa] Yeah, do you believe, at all, in the stories about the Blair Witch? [pop music playing] [Peter] Hey, Lisa, I can't tell, is this thing recording or not? [Lisa] Yeah, it should be. Did you-- did you press and hold the button when you did it? Yeah. [Ashley] These things are so small. Like, where do you put it? Okay. Recording. We are recording. [Lisa] Just, uh, make sure it's always facing forward. And make sure you press the button down. - Did you hold it down? - Okay, got it, got it, got it. - Yeah, I got it. - Did you hold it down? Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down. - Hey, Peter! - Yeah? How do I look? Yeah, that's sexy. [Ashley laughs] [music continues] The thing is, he's going back out to those woods to look for his sister, Lisa. 'Cause he thinks she could still be there 'cause of some blurry footage that some weirdo put online. So, like, how's that gonna look? I don't wanna exploit anyone. That's not the point. All right, then don't tell anyone about it. Okay? How 'bout that? Use that. There's an option. Don't tell anyone. Just come out there with us. Film it like he wants you to, as his friend. Don't use the footage for your movie. - I can't promise that. No, I can't. - Right. - I know. I know you can't. - I can't promise that, Peter, because like what if something actually happens out there? I see you, Lisa. Yeah, right, okay, I'ma get a beer. What if we find something that they never found? I'm so sorry. He and James have just been friends forever. Just because I haven't been friends with him for as long as you guys doesn't mean I don't care. I know that! You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ah, fuck me, man. [Ashley] How are you feeling? You're asking if I regret getting drunk the night before going camping in the woods? I do not. [laughs] Okay. Let's just move back a little bit. How far does it go? Like, 100 meters is the max, I think. [motor whirring] [Lisa] Ashley and I have used these in class before. Just like cheap helicopter shots, you know. It could be useful in terms of finding our way around the forest. [Ashley] Yeah, but we're gonna have a GPS though, right? [Lisa] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's built into the earpiece camera, but it only works when it's on, though. So just keep an eye on the battery in case we get separated. [James on radio] Com check, over. "Com check"? Yeah, that's like, what people say in the military, over. Okay, anyways, it's working. Over. - Copy that. Over and out. - [laughs] - Hey, the walkie-talkies work. - [Peter] Yeah, we know. [Ashley] He's got the bass in his voice. - [James] Somebody wasn't hydrated. - [Ashley giggles] [Lisa] Whoa... - [Peter] Boom, we're safe. - Okay, which one is you guys'? - We're this one. - [Peter] Oh, this is ours. - [Peter] Okay! - [Ashley laughs] Whoa! - [James growls over radio] - [laughing] [walkie-talkie feedback] - Lay with us. - Oh, no. - [Peter] We got room. - James! James! James! [mumbling] Good night, folks. Oh, yeah. - [Peter] I don't know... - [Lisa] He has been a little... [Ashley] Who you bragging to? [Lisa] And this used to be called Blair? [James] Sort of. There was a town called Blair back in the 1700s, but it was discovered abandoned. So they founded a new town, called it Burkittsville. [Peter] I think so? [Ashley] My god. [dogs barking] [Lane] They're here! - Hey! Hey, come in. - [James] Hey. - [James] Hope they fixed... - Hey. [Lisa] Hi. [Talia] Can I get anybody, like, water or anything to drink? - Water or... - I'm okay. Thank you. I'll take some water. -[Lane] Feel free to make yourself at home. Just through there. Yeah, have a seat in there and, uh, Lane'll be right with you. [Lane] Hey, I'm glad you're all recording this. Not every day we get like-minded investigators coming out here to discuss the Blair Witch. There you go. [camera beeps] [Lisa] Hey, I may need to get you guys to sign some release forms later if that's... Yeah, sure, that's cool. I'll probably need you to sign one, too. So, you're Darknet666? [Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are, but, uh, you can call me Lane. [Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are, but, uh, you can call me Lane. [Lane] Yeah. Well, we both are, but, uh, you can call me Lane. - This is-- this is Talia. - Hi. So... Okay, well, first off, I was hoping you could show us where you found the tape. We're gonna make that our starting point. Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods? [Peter] Yep. That's the plan. Why? [whispers] You ask 'em. Uh, we wanna go out there with you. I mean, if you're gonna be looking around, we wanna be a part of that. It's not, you know... We're not gonna be a burden or anything. - We go camping all the time. - [Talia] Mmm-hmm. Hey, look, that's the deal if you want us to show you where we found it. Is it okay if we talk it over in private, real quick? [Lane] No, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, sure, go ahead. - What do you think? - [Peter] Nope. [Lisa] Well, don't we need them to show us exactly where they found the tape? - [James] Yeah. - Yeah, but I didn't think they'd want to stick around after that. Well, they didn't exactly make it sound like we have an option. [sighs] [James] What are you bragging about? [Peter] No, I-- I'm serious. [Ashley] You say that to people? [heavy metal playing over stereo] [Peter] Look at this guy. You crack me up. [music continues] [Peter] We made it. [exhales] Yeah. All right. Lisa. Got you. Baby, what the hell do you have in here? [grunts] [giggles] It's heavy. Lisa. And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp. [grunts] Okay. [Peter] Hey, it's cool if we leave our cars here? Yeah, it's fine. They're safe. No one comes out this way. [James] I'm already hungry. [Peter] Yeah, I'm thinkin' I could eat. [James] Could eat all these granola bars in the backpack. [Peter chuckles] [Peter] Hey, what do you think they're smoking up there? [Ashley] Mmm, definitely bath salts. [both laugh] You know what? I'm gonna go ask. [Ashley] Peter, wait! No! Hey, yo, Darknet666, wait up! I saw some of your other videos. Yeah? Yeah. Before we came out here. Saw this one, it was really interesting where you guys, like, found this little pile of rocks. [laughs] [Whispers] Would you stop? Symbols. "Symbols"? Oh, they were symbols. No, no, no, seriously. So, do you guys really believe all these old stories? I mean, 'cause someone's died everywhere, at some point, right? Doesn't mean that every square foot of this planet is haunted. Did you grow up here? - [Peter] No. - See, I-- I did. Talia did. We both-- we both grew up here. And the older folks in town used to talk a lot about these woods when I was little. And after... his sister and her crew went missing and their stuff got found, suddenly, everyone I know just wanted to forget it. This area has a history of things happening that no one really likes to talk about. Rustin Parr. Coffin Rock. List goes on and on. Hmm. [indistinct conversation] - [Lane] Watch yourself. Watch your step! - Yeah. It goes down here. [Talia] Back in the 1940s, Rustin Parr brought eight kids out to his house in these woods. Killed seven of 'em. But Parr claimed that he heard the voice of an old woman telling him to kill the children. He would take them up to his attic and make one stand in a corner while he killed the other one. [Lane] There's been some debate on that actually, where whether it was the attic or the basement. So he thought he heard the Blair Witch telling him to kill people? Well, he never said who it was. He just said that it sounded like this voice of an old woman. They hanged him out in these woods, near his house. [Lisa] So wait, he had a house out here? Yeah. That's not the one we're looking for though. Pan's house was burnt down after he was hanged. Supposedly they found a bunch of old tunnels and stuff underneath that didn't go anywhere. Some kind of underground rail road thing, I think. [indistinct conversation] [Peter] Oh, my back. [buzzing] [camera beeps] [Lane] Okay, so this is, uh, this is technically where the Black Hills Woods start. Back from when this was private land. [Ashley] Uh, well, who owns it now? No one. It's the state's, I guess. [Ashley] So, we're not trespassing or anything, right? No. No one cares. No one living, that is. [Peter laughs] [James snickering] [indistinct] If we have to go camping with the locals, could you please not piss them off? Baby, I di-- I didn't say anything. You don't have to say anything, Peter, you know that. [laughing] I'm sorry. Sorry. [Lisa] Okay, Goofy. [camera beeps] [Lane] The glare on the plastic... [James] You just, you we-- you were walking by and you saw it? [Lane] This is where we found the DV tape. [Peter] And there was nothing else on the tape? [Lane] No. Like I said, it was all static except for that bit that we uploaded. [Ashley] Why does the tree look like that? [Talia] Lightning. Sometimes when it hits the tree, the electricity goes into the ground and it burns the tree from the roots up. - [James] Was it just underneath here? - [Lane] Yeah. It was like half under and half out, but we had to dig a little. ...wasn't your fault. I just couldn't help laughing at you. [Talia] A girl drowned in this creek. It was around when Burkittsville was founded. Her family was doing the washing and her mother said she saw a hand reach out of the water and pull her daughter in. Probably the only reason we still know about it is 'cause there were newspaper articles, 'cause the girl's body was never found. Are we crossing this? - Oh, yeah. - Oh! - [Lane] Yeah, let us know how it is. - [James] Ooh, it's freezing. I'm walking across the water. [James] That's great. - Oh! [laughing] - [James] Oh! That's cold. [Ashley] Leeches are fine? What do you mean? [Lane] Wait, wait, you said there was leeches? [Ashley] No, I'm just asking. Are you coming? [Lisa] Did you get a pedicure before you came here? [laughing] Ye$_ - Ah! [fake cries] - I know, I know. You sure this is a good idea? [Lane] Uh, will you hold the camera for me for just one second? My shoes... - All right. Oh, oh! - [Ashley] Careful there. Ah! That's cold! Wait, I got it, I got it. You got it? All right. [Peter] Careful. - You all right? - [Lane] Oh... [Ashley screams] [James] Ashley! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Hey, hey, hey! Come on, okay. [sobs] I cut my foot on a rock - or a piece of broken glass or something. - [James] You'll be all right. [Peter] Okay, there we go. We gotcha. - You okay? - Yeah. [Peter] You're all right, you're all right. [James] Careful, careful, careful. Okay. Let's see that foot. Okay. Ah, you're all right. [James] You're all right. You're all right. Is it bad? It just feels like it's really deep and it hurts. [James] No, it's not bad at all. I just gotta clean it. Lisa, do you mind gettin' my first-aid kit? - It's in my bag over there. - Huh? - Lisa. First-aid kit. Bag. Please. - Oh, shit! - Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. - Thank you very much. - Lane! Jesus! Manners, dude. - Hey! Hey! Back up! Back up! I'll get this shot really quick and then I'll be good. - [Peter] Get back over there. - Just like one more second? - [Peter] I swear... - [Lane] All right, all right. [James] All right, I've seen much worse than this. - There you go. Oh, oh, it's okay. - [wincing] - Try not to move it too much. - Feels like it's really big. No, it feels a lot worse than it actually is. I promise. - Pressure. It's okay. It's all right. - Ah! Now we just gotta wrap it up and you'll be good to walk on it. Gotta bring it around. [Peter] Thank you, James. [James] No problem, man. Okay. You wanna try standing up? ' [Ashley] Yeah. - Okay. All right, don't put too much pressure on it. [Peter] Ready? One, two, three. - There you go. You all right? - Yeah. - Not so bad. - Not so bad. - Oh. Ow. - You okay? [Peter] Come to my palace in the woods. [Peter laughs] This is how we roll. In style without-- [Ashley] No, that's what I'm trying to say is, um... Is it-- fuck. - [Ashley] Babe, Babe, it's bent. - Babe, I got it, I got! Please, let me just put the tent together. Okay? I'm just saying that the pole is-- I just need to put the tent together right now. It's not supposed to be bent, I know. So you just bend-- This-- is this supposed to be bent? This is not the entrance. [Ashley] That's not. Well, that's not either. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you, tent! [rhythmic beeping] Okay. Everything's good. [Peter] Hey, I'm gonna go get some firewood before it gets totally dark, okay? Looks like the sun's coming down pretty quick. [James] Well, hold up. Let's finish this and I'll come with you. [chuckles] No, man, I'm not goin' too far, okay? I'll keep my camera on. You can see me on the GPS, all right? [James] Okay. Well, take a walkie-talkie with you, please. [Peter] Man. Brother, already got one. [walkie-talkie beeps] - Thank you. - Yeah. [drone whirring] [Ashley] What exactly should we be looking for? [James] We're looking for the house from Heather's footage. Do you see the" do you see any clearings? Anything like that? [Ashley] I shouldn't take this thing too much further up, but, I mean, I don't see anything yet. [Peter snickers] [indistinct conversations] [James] Yeah. That was a good movie. [Ashley groans] [James] I'm unsettled, immediately. [Peter] All right. Yeah. Yeah. - [Lisa] Ew! Ew! - [James] I'm uncomfortable with this. What? [Lisa] Why do you have to eat it like that? - I didn't mean to. - [James] Eat it a little bit quicker. You don't have to go all slow like that. Oh, god! [Ashley] It really, really did scar me for life. I don't want to ever fish again. [indistinct conversations] Okay, so the Blair Witch. Who is she really? [Talia] Elly Kedward. That's what most people say. [clears throat] She was accused of witchcraft after some of the children in town said that she'd taken blood from them. There wasn't much of a trial system back then. Townspeople took her out to these woods, tied her to a tree and left her to die of exposure. In the spring they went back to look for her body but there was no trace of it. They assumed she was eaten by animals or something, but... then people in the town started disappearing. First the children who'd accused her, and their families. Then others. Eventually, everyone who was left just abandoned their homes, fled the town. [Lane] Well... What? [laughs] - What? - Well, I was just gonna add... According to this book I read, published in 1809, they didn't just tie Elly Kedward to a tree. I mean, they did tie her to a tree, but they tied her up really high and they strung these heavy rocks to her arms and legs as weights, stretching her. Ugh. They left her to die on a makeshift rack. Okay. Thanks. [Lane] Ever since, there's been a curse on these woods. The legend says if you look directly at the witch you'll die just from the fright of it. That's why Rustin Parr stood in that corner. They say no one's ever seen her and lived to talk about it. [Peter] Or, alternately, no one has ever seen her, period. This is all just stories, okay? I've been to these woods before. When I was a kid with about 100 other people. [Talia] You were part of those search teams? I remember that. Yeah. So how come I'm okay? Nothing got me then. [Lane] Maybe it did. You're back, right? All right, real theory, real theory. One that I've read online. Whatever spell the witch put on these woods, you have to be out here at night for it to get you. You have to spend the night. Wait, well, then how come you're still alive? That's a good point. Maybe she's using us to lure you all out here. [Ashley] Okay, on that note, I'm going to bed. - [Peter] Yeah, me, too. - [James] We should get some rest. We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. - 'Night, dudes. - [Peter] Yeah, good night, man. [indistinct chatter] [Lisa] Good night, James. [James] 'Night. [zipper closing] [camera beeps] [James breathing heavily] [James whispers] I just heard something moving outside. [branches breaking] Oh, my... [mumbles] [branches continue breaking] [loud rumble] Shit. Shit! [wolves howling] [James panting] What the fuck'? Hey, Lisa. [both gasping] [James] Lisa? What the hell are you doing? - Did you hear that out there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard it. There's something out there, out in the woods, like a bear. [shushes] Okay, here. Thanks. [loud radio static] [screams] What the fuck was that? It's okay. It's just my walkie-talkie. - It's all right, that's all right. - [Lisa] Shit! Peter, is that you? Com check. [Peter on radio] James, what the hell was that? [Lisa] Oh, fuck. [James] I don't know, man, I don't know. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're okay, we're okay. Lisa's here too, we're okay. I mean, she just came, like, just now came into my tent. [Lisa] Like 30 seconds ago. - [Talia] Hey, is everyone okay out there? - [indistinct radio chatter] [Peter] Yeah, we're fine. You two good? [Talia] No. Lane's not here. [James] Where is he? [Talia] Well, he went-- he went off to pee, but he always goes far off for privacy. [James] Oh, god. Hey, Lane! Lane! Lane! [sighing] Oh, god damn it. We should probably go look for him, right? Make sure he's okay? - [Peter] No. - [Ashley] No. [Peter] No, I'm not goin' out there. [Ashley] That is definitely not a good idea. [Talia] Well, I'm gonna go. He's been gone for a while. [James] Okay. I'll come with you. Um... - Shit, he might be lost, okay? - Um... - I'll be right back. - Okay. I guess I should probably go back to my tent. - I mean, you can stay here if you want. - Okay. - Yeah? - Okay. All right. I'll be back soon. All right. [zipper closes] [Peter] Hey, good luck, man. - Careful. There. - Thanks. [camera beeps] [shouting] Lane! [Tafia] Lane! Lane! [James] God, where is he? Lane! [Tafia] Lane! Lane! Did you see that tree that fell? Sounded like it landed nearby. Yeah, but sounds can travel pretty far out here. - Did you guys hear that? - [Talia and James scream] [James] Lane! Lane, what the fuck, man? I'm sorry, man. Tell me you recorded those sounds. Did you get those sounds? - [James] Yeah, Lisa and I were recording. - Okay. I went to see if I could find what was makin' those noises. I couldn't find anything. Did you guys find anything? [James] No, dude. Just let's get back to the camp, okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - [James] You okay? - Yeah. [James] Okay. [camera beeps] [Ashley] You guys, get out here! No. No, no, no, I'm getting out of here. I'm packing, I'm leaving. This is fucked up. [James] Holy shit. [Ashley] I wanna go home, okay? [James] Where'd this stuff come from? Someone must've put these things up while we were asleep. [Lane] Why, what's going on? What's wrong'? [Ashley] What do you think? [chuckles] We should film these. Talia, get the camera. You guys should be taking pictures! What is it? [gasps] [Lane] Thank you. [Talia] What? What is it? [Ashley] You guys, seriously I want to go home now. We need to get out of here. [Peter] Hey, James, that's not a bad idea, okay? We're not prepared for this. [James] Okay, I've seen this stuff before. This was in Heather's footage, guys. Shit, there's another one back here. [Lane] That's my tent! [James] Does anybody know what time it is? My watch is sayin' 2:00 p.m. [Ashley] What? How is it even possible we just woke up? [Peter] Look, I know I was tired, but how did we sleep till 2:00 in the afternoon? [Ashley] Can we please get out of here? [James] You know what? Ashley's right. Let's just pack up our stuff and get back to my car, okay? No, no, no, wait, wait. Are you sure'? Yeah, yeah, this is too weird. I dunno, we found something, right? Like, we can show the footage to the police. Maybe they'll reopen Heather's case. Wait, I wanna get that on camera. [Ashley] I think it's just... Just rip it off the tree, for Christ's sake. [James] Oh, holy shit. Wait, wait, that's the shot, that's the shot. [Ashley] I have an idea. Why don't you stay here and get all the footage you want? All right, that's it. Come on, turn it off. Turn it off. Let's go! [Lane] I wanna get a shot of it, okay? [Ashley] Oh, fuck this. [Lisa] So, hey, what kinda camera is that, man? Oh, it's a DV camera. [Lisa] Oh, yeah? It's old. It's good in low light. - It's better than modern cameras. - [Lisa] Okay. Does it use tapes? Like the one you found? Or is it... You know, there's not too many brands of them anymore. Why? Oh, nothing, I... Just curious. [Lane] Well, I mean, I recommend it. Everything is cards now, but in some ways, you know tapes are more reliable and cheaper. Do have to carry a lot of batteries, though. [Lisa] Oh, yeah? [cracking] [Ashley] Ow! Ah! [James] Ooh! Ashley! - [Peter] Hey, you all right? - You okay? What's going on? [Ashley] Yeah, yeah, yeah-. I'm fine. It's just my foot. [James] Want me to take the boot off? [Ashley] No, it just hurt for a second, but feels fine now. - [James] Okay. Can you feel that? - [Ashley] Yeah. - [James] Does that hurt? - [Ashley] It's fine. [Talia] Hey, Lane. Lane. Stop it. Stop it! - What the fuck are you doing? - [Lisa] What is this? This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys? Yeah, that's rope. And kindling. That's useful for camping. Give that to me! Whoa, whoa, hey, hey! Get back. [Lisa] You have the symbols from the camp, don't you, Talia? So can I see one? Because this rope looks exactly the same. [Ashley] What the hell? Definitely does not look the same. Rope is rope. Open your eyes. [Peter] But let her see it, then. She doesn't need to see it! - Let her see it. - Get the fuck off me, man! Hey, hey! Listen, stop it! Listen, we weren't trying to scare you or anything, we just... We weren't lying about the things that are going on in these woods. We just needed somebody to see what was happening. [Lane] Oh, no, no, no! Did you... You faked this? Yeah, yeah, we faked it. All right, but look we faked it because it's real, okay? There really is something happening here, guys, in these woods. [Ashley] And that makes sense to you? Hey, we didn't fake those noises last night. And sleeping until 2:00? How could we fake that? There is something really going on out here in these woods. Right. For all we know you guys put sleeping pills in our water or something. - What? - Did you? - No! - No, 'course not. Okay, fuck this. I'm out. You guys-- you guys want this. This is on you. Hey, get a shot of this! Lane. [softly] Those fucking assholes. [Lane] Uh, guys... Uh... We don't have the GPS thing. There's no cell reception out here, so I mean... - [Peter] That's not our problem, man. - Just hear rne out. What if-- what if we get lost, okay? What if we get lost? [James] I thought you guys came out here all the time? - We've been following you! - I don't know what-- [Peter] Oh, my god! You gotta be fucking kidding me, man! We've never been as far as the creek, but nobody has. Nobody's been here for years. - Shit, man! - [James] We don't know where we are! - Okay, just calm down. We meant to.. - Fuck! - We wanted safety in numbers, okay? - Jesus Christ! There's more of us, so the odds are better. Is there anything that you two told us that is not a lie? And I guess it's just a coincidence that your camera uses the exact same kind of tape that you found? No, it wasn't... [James] Okay, I think you two got all the footage you need. You walk that way for about two miles, you'll hit the fence. Look, can we just calm down? We could just talk about this. - No! Get outta here! - Guys, come on, please! - Okay, okay, sure, sure! Go, go. - Please! Just come on. Cut the camera off. You guys don't understand, okay, you're not from here. - [Peter] Get out of here! - [Ashley] Just go! We're done talking! It's time to go! Let's go! - Stop it! - Please, man! - Take him. Go. - Come on! [Lane] Guys, are you sure this is-- Does this have to happen? We could talk about this. - We could talk about it.

Heather could still be out here. [Peter] They're pathetic, man. [James] God, I should've known they were-- Fuck. I guess I just... Oh, god. [sniffles] [Lisa] Yeah, well... I don't know about you guys, but I feel a little bit, you know, less scared being in the woods now. [all] Yeah. [Peter] Are you gonna be okay? - [James] I'm all right, man. I'm okay. - I'ma give you a hug. - Don't give me a hug. - I'ma give you a hug. Don't give me a hug... - [Ashley] Aw, look at that. - [grunts] [indistinct chatter] - [Ashley gasps] - [Peter] Oh, sorry.

[Peter] That's a good thing, right? [Ashley] How can you even tell? [Lisa] I don't know. Just... I thought we'd... [Ashley] Baby, what? [Peter] No. No! No way! No way! [Ashley] We've been walking in a circle? [James] That doesn't make sense. I've been following the GPS. Then we should've reached the fence hours ago! We shouldn't be back at the same fuckin' campsite we just left! - Can I see the GPS, James? - Yeah. It must be broken. [sighs] - [Ashley] We're lost. - [James] No, we're not lost. We, we got turned around. We gotta... [Peter] "Got turned around." [sighs] Let's look around with the drone. We can start hiking for the road. Yeah, okay, let's do that.

Look, let's just set up the tents. We'll be okay. This is fine. We'll-- we'll figure it out. [Ashley] Can you please at least take down those creepy stick figures? - I can't look at those things anymore. - I got it, I got it. [Lisa] Hey, can I see your camera? Just wanna charge the batteries and change the cards out and stuff. [soft thud] [James] Yeah. - [Lisa] Did you hear that? - [James] What? [Lisa] Nothing. Nothing. My ears are playing tricks on me. You know what? I thought I heard a voice earlier-- Hey. Hey, how you doin'? [Ashley] I'm fine. I'm just freezing. Can you tell James to start a fire? Okay. Oh, babe. Hey, we should check out this cut on your foot. Yeah, okay. Okay... I'll just take that off. - Ow! - Oh, babe, okay. - Be careful, it hurts. - I gotcha. All right. Looks like you... It's a bit irritated. Is it bad? [stammers] No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. No, it's fine. I mean, uh, we should just, you know, um, put some ointment on it. I'll go get James and-- [cracking] - [screams] - What, what, what, what, what? Don't do that! Ow! - What was that? What just happened? - [groans] [Ashley] okay. okay- It's fine now. Just... be careful how you touch it, okay? That's how it felt when I fell earlier today. O-- okay, um... I'm gonna set your foot down. Okay? And, uh... You should just stay lying down. I'll be right back. [drone beeping] Okay. I'm just gonna rest my eyes. Okay. [drone whirring] [Peter] Hey, I need to talk to you. That cut on Ashley's foot, it's gotten worse. [inaudible] But-- No, no, whatever it was, it was really fuckin' weird, man, and-- [James] Okay. You said it looked like a muscle spasm? Yeah, or something like-- I don't know. Whatev-- There's something inside of her cut. Now she's cold and I think she has a fever. So I just... [James] Okay. Okay, I'll go take a look at it right now. - Thank you. - Yep. [Peter] I wanna keep a fire goin' for her tonight. So I'm gonna gather some wood if you guys think you can get it started. - That's a good idea. - Thanks, man. - Hey, keep your walkie-talkie on. - Of course. [Lisa] Hey, will you look at this? [James] What? What is it? Well, I don't see a road or the creek or anything. Should I take it further out? Maybe it's the angle or something? [erratic whirring] What? [James] Whoa. What happened? I don't know. I don't... Oh, my god. Oh, shit! [drone crashes] [gasps] [Lisa] Fuck! [sighs] [Peter] Oh, god damn it. Lisa, if you're watching this footage, I think you're gonna wanna delete it. [chain zips] [grunts softly] [Lisa] How is she? [whispers] It's infected and she has a fever. Did you see anything, like... moving, like Peter said? [Ashley groans] Uh, nothing like that. But we should take her straight to the closest ER tomorrow. Okay. [Peter breathing heavily] [walkie-talkie beeps] [radio static] [beeps] [Peter] Damn it. Hey, James, is that you?

[shouts] Peter! [sighs] Fuck. - [gasps] - Lisa. What? I don't feel so good. Where's Peter? Um, he went to go get some firewood, but he'll be back soon, okay? Come on, let's get you back to bed. - Lisa! - [93598] Hey. Would everyone stop doing that? Oh, fuck. I found Peter's flashlight out there. Shit. That was him screaming out there, right? - I think so. - Oh, god! [Lisa] No, James, look, it'll be okay. Look, we need to stay together. [James] Yeah, you're right, you're right. Let's just keep the fire going. If he sees it, he can find his way back. [Lisa softly] Okay. You know, I actually thought that Heather could still be out in these woods, somehow. But now... Peter's lost. And Ashley's hurt. It'll be okay. [branches breaking] [whispers] Did you hear that? Yeah. [branch breaking] Do you think that could be Peter? I don't know.

[Lisa] Guys, we're not gonna fall for your stupid shit again! Can you just tell us what's going on? Do I look like I'm messing with you? Do you have any food? No, no, get back! Please. Will you get back here, please? [Talia] I want it! Stop it! [Lane] We're alive! Don't you see that? You crazy? [Talia] Look at them! They're doing better than us, aren't they?
