(upbeat music) (playful music) - Senor Quintero, please. - Over there. I am looking for Senor Quintero. - What do you want him for? (man mumbles) What? - Little business. - Well, then you better lay it on me because I just taken over all over Quintero's action. You might say we had a merger and I liquidated his assets. He's dead.

There's another dude that operates in the west half of the waterfront, and he has the distinction of being called West Eddie. u're the boss of the waterfront. - Not yet, my friend, but soon two will meet. East is east, west is west. Until old Eddie gets the rest. Sit down! audience shouts over each other) - No, not! Not under! Damn it. Shit! Shit! - How's it goin', Logan? - Hey, listen, Eddie. a little run of bad luck today. I mean, nothin' I won't be able to throw in a week or so.

Hey, Eddie, believe me, man, it's not like the last time, the money's really on the way. I really need it, man. Got a little pressing business. - (laughs) I saw your pressing business, didn't I? - What do you say, Eddie, huh? - Oh, man, I'm uptight, I can't think when I'm like that. Now I'm gonna go to Tillie Fingers and we can talk there. y, can't we talk here, you know? - Nah. - Hey, Eddie? Hey, man, listen. - (moans) Lower. Lower. - Eddie, we really ought to stick together. - (laughs) Don't give me that fellow American bit. u owe me, man, you owe me a lot. The only reason you aren't floatin' in the bay now is 'cause I like ya. (moans) 'Cause I like ya, I'm gonna help you help yourself. Oh, lower, lower. (moans) Tillie and the golden fingers. (laughs) Oh, your hands are a gold mine! (moans) Here, feast your eyes on this. - It's a Tuscarora. That's worth 1,000 pesos, maybe more, where'd you get it? - Can you fence it? ce hell, it'll go like wildfire. These are rare, I haven't seen one in years. A lot more where that came from. I'll supply, you deal, we'll split down the middle. - Put her there, pard. Beautiful. Really beautiful. - Come on. - You know, with enough of these, we'd be fixed for life. any idea where these came from? - Sort of. - You know, if a man could find the source of these babies, 'd be in milk and honey forever. (Eddie chuckles) , you got money and I'm a diver. Now all we need's a boat and some good equipment. We can pick up for a song! Just give me a small advance, e us movin' in a couple of days. - Listen, man, I know where you're coming from and the idea's out of sight. t I wanna put Mathias into this. Uh, he's an expert diver, he has his own boat, and he knows the islands like the back of his hand. - It's no good, it won't work, if we bring him in, gotta make it a three way scene! - So, we'll split it three ways. - No, we don't need him. - I want him! He'll keep us honest. - Eddie, believe me, I know the region better than Mathias. d in the islands for five years, I covered every inch of 'em! We can do it alone. st tell me where you found them. bly an island I used to live on. (Eddie laughs) - You don't really expect me to tell you that, do you? 'll know when the time is right. (chatter in foreign language) (jazzy piano music) - Little more, please? - Oh, no, thank you. - Hi, Bob. - Sir. As usual? - Yeah. - Make it Chivas Regal Royal Salute for Mr. Mathias. - Yes, sir. - What's the pitch? - Just a friendly drink, between fellow Americans. - Uh-huh. got a little proposition for ya. - Oh, really? You're comin' in a lot clearer. - Now, about that proposition. - You know, I've always heard you could find ese pearls in the outer islands. When I was a frog man, I knew a lot of divers who tried, but they all failed. Well, for one sixth of the take, an be the diver that finds them. See, I know where they are. Naturally, I came to you because, (chuckles) well, you're a fellow American. - Oh, sure. - Deal? I'll throw in my boat, gear and first mate for a sixth. - You got it. - Beautiful. A sixth for them and a sixth for me, that makes a third. - No, now, hold it, that's not the deal I offered. No, I won't go for that. - I'll be on my boat. But since you know where I hang out and the kinda booze I like to drink, I guess you know where I'm moored. e there when you're ready to go. e there when you're ready to go. - Boy. That's my number. Usually. go away, folks, keep your seats. I'll be back shortly and show you how to break this place. Well, hello. - I've been waiting for a chance to talk you. - I'm all yours. - Um, not here. Privately. - We can go to my place. - Mine. 9:30 in the morning. - In the morning? - Mm-hm. - It's a raid! (patrons yell) (dramatic music) - Stay where you are! - Don't anybody move! - Don't forget, 9:30! - Right, I'll be there! (peaceful exotic music) (clears his throat) here a Kathy Vernon around here? - Dr. Katherine Vernon? She left a message for you, she's waiting for you llery of Primitive Pacific Arts. Up the stairs, to the left. - Up the stairs to the left. Well, well, so the good doctor cruises at night. - Sometimes it's well worth it. - Can you leave now? - And where are you going to whisk me off to? - My place. - And what would we do there? uh, explore each other's minds. - In the spirit of detached scientific curiosity, of course? - Not exactly, but you can look at it like that, 's what it takes to turn you on. - I'm afraid I've given you the wrong impression, mister-- - Logan. Like hell you did. Now, you were saying something to me last night, and I heard you loud and clear. - Alright, I deceived you. But I had a reason for it. - I'll bet you did. - Look at this mask, Mr. Logan. The eyes are Tuscarora pearls. know where the pearl came from. tribe may be from the same area. - You want in? - I'm only interested in trying to locate a lost tribe, and nothing more. - No dice. guess I'll have to fumble around and arrange my own expedition. Talk to a lot of people, ask a lot of questions. - Suit yourself. an get together some other time. you were talking to last night. His name's Mathias, isn't it? uppose you'll be using his boat? - If I have to do something about you, I will. But I want you to know my heart won't be in it. - Mr. Logan. I wanna make a name for myself in my profession. I don't expect it to come easy. I don't want any of your pearls. (moody orchestral music) - You boys have a nice swim? - I told you to be suited up when I came topside. - Yeah, well school's out. let's get the show on the road. - I've checked everybody out who's gonna dive, except joy boy here, if he gets it in a sling-- - Then we split it two ways. - What about him? - That's what you're payin' him the sixth for, he dives. - Hello! - What the hell's this? - Well, I told you guys to stop bad mouthin' and shove off. - You don't mean... Of all the dumb stunts, tellin' a broad's like blastin' it over a loudspeaker! - Yeah, well that's exactly what she would've done, if I hadn't brought her along, she overheard us rappin' about the pearl at the casino last night. Look, she's a scientist. Look, she's a scientist. - I wonder what kind of a scientist. (chuckles) - Let's get the hell outta here e the whole damn city boards us. (upbeat music) We're lookin' for a guy by the name of Manuel. e's a fisherman in this village. - He's probably stoned. (villager laughs) - This is the island of Murigao? illager speaks foreign language) We're looking for a fisherman by the name of Manuel. Many people here called Manuel. en did you last see this Manuel? - Yesterday. - The Manuel we're looking for was in the city yesterday. - Ah. Manuel the Barracuda. (dramatic music) (Manuel groans) (Manuel screams) What do you think you're doing? I'm speakin' to him in a dialect he can't refuse to understand! The truth! - No, no, no! - And you talk to me in English. - Every two months, a young woman comes to the village. She trades pearls for supplies. (camera clicks) - Just like Manuel said, no dock and no boats. - We got some time we can check a couple of those spots out. - Think we oughta check out the people first. What's that for? ood offense is the best defense. ey, come on, we're wastin' time. We got about an hour's worth of light left! If we get the gear out fast... maid sitting on a Greek centaur. I wonder what it's doing here. - Where's the people? - Something's fishy. ks like they split when we came. Still warm. - Maybe they don't like uninvited dinner guests. - Yeah, maybe we'd better come back after breakfast and introduce ourselves. - Probably out in the bushes checkin' us out. (camera clicks) Mm, this couple's got problems. - There's not much more we can do here tonight. The light will be gone soon. I told you we were wastin' time. - Got another 20 shots left. - You could've fooled me. ought that thing froze up solid. (Mathias chuckles) (peaceful orchestral music) (moody music) (suspenseful music) Hey. You better stay close. (screams) Oh, god, no! Oh! (screams) em off me, get it off! (screams) - Do something. Sanchez, grab his hand, get in there, hold onto his feet! (Eddie screams) Now, pull! Pull! Pull! - Oh, god! (groans) ot to clean and wrap his wounds. Sanchez, get the first aid kit in the rowboat. Catch him! - Let me go! God damn crabs. (gun fires) Let go! Let go! were standing right here talking before we went back to the boat last night. (moody orchestral music) What are you doing on my island? re lookin' for Tuscarora pearls. learn of the pearls from Manuel? t be the broad he told us about. e don't wanna cause any trouble. We just want to get some pearls, and leave you and your island when that's done. - What if you found nothing? f the only pearls you could find ready belonged to somebody else? - Well there'd have to be more where they came from. dy's gonna keep us from lookin'. show you to the beds of pearls. - Are they near? - Yes, quite near. ell, that's very generous of ya. How can you stay under water for so long without gear? - Hey! - What happened? Some mother grabber set a trap. otten crabs tried to rip me off! (Mathias laughs) - That's just fate tryin' to get back at you, Eddie. - Yeah? ll, old Eddie got the last bite. nd it's crab stew tonight, baby. - I must apologize. We of Artouri know of the storage pits of every hut. - Artouri? It's a means of storing sea food until we're ready to eat it. - That storage pit wasn't there last night. - You are mistaken. (suspenseful music) come you on behalf of my people, to our island of Artouri. am Nereus, elder of this island. And this is my daughter, Syrene. you to move into the guest huts. Enjoy the fruits of Artouri. (dramatic orchestral music) - I'd better go with ya. - No. If something's gonna happen, the others will need your help. - Yeah. Well, don't take any chances. If something so much as smells like trouble, come back for help, huh? - The sooner we're out of here, the better I like it. set up a guard system tomorrow. - Don't eat so much crab. I want some for breakfast. - See ya in the mornin'. (moody music) (music intensifies) - Hey, I'm sorry about your mate, but we all run the risk n' wiped out on a gig like this. Between fixin' the anchor cable and the search, we've lost a lot of time. - The sooner we get the pearls, the sooner we can get the hell out of here. (moody music) How do we know we can trust her? - We don't. (suspenseful music) - Hello? - Hello? en wanting to talk to one of you ever since we came here. you people originally come from? (animals whines) How can you swim so deep and stay down so long? (chuckles) Just like fish. You are a guest on this island. st learn to respect our privacy, if you wish to remain welcome. - I wanna show you something. Do you recognize it? (animals whines) No! (animals whines) - Milk and honey, baby! (laughs) Careful, very careful! - Hey, let me have that! Yee-hah! (laughs) guys got 10 minutes of air left! Time is money, baby, dive! - Hang it on your ear, baby, hang it on your ear! (Eddie chuckles) (eerie atmospheric music) - Do not touch it! (ominous music) Move away. Leave her alone. (sighs) You must be careful where you go on this island. places where you should not be. as a shadow to your companions. est huts and the beach are safe. Stay there. Stay there. - Thank you. e leave when the haul gets here. an dig where you're comin' from. - What's that, Eddie? ound like a scared money better. (chuckles) It's bad odds, baby. lready had two dudes ripped off. - Well, nothing's gonna stop me. Not now. I'm gonna buy me a dream. Mr. Luxury. Get me some good fighting cocks, maybe a couple of broads. Yeah, well I'll see ya the pick of the litter from my stable. I'm gonna buy a couple of buildings, you know, get my broads off the corner. East Eddie's Pleasure Palace. If we ain't got it, you don't want it. (chuckles) - What about you, Mathias? - I'll probably spend it on somethin' just as foolish. You want a refill? More coffee? - No, thanks. - You're really into it. - You're really into it. - I saw the exact duplicate of this mask today. - At this temple in the jungle? - Now, the one we have at the museum was found on one of the islands of Crete about a half a century ago. ved in the style of the Minoans. They lived about 2,000 BC. - Are you making a connection? - I'd like to. They could be descendants. ns supposedly lived on an island that sink into the sea. Atlantis. - Are you saying these people migrated here? - It's just a conjecture. Atlantis had a similar climate. w do you account for their eyes? - I don't know. Environment, possibly. Or a form of genetic mutation brought about by inbreeding. - Incest? - Mm-hm. en what about Nereus and Syrene? they have eyes like the others? 'm just making a lot of guesses. I don't know nearly enough. But I'll find out. I must. (moody music) - When will you mate? It has been days. You should be with child. Look upon me! ly hurt and destruction can come from the feelings within you. It is your destiny to mate with an outsider. Not to love him. There can be nothing more. You are of different species. you do not choose, immediately, I will let Vian commit them one and all to the sea. o that which is expected of you. Go! - Looks good. t do you think the haul's worth? - I figure it oughta fetch us about $100,000 US currency. (Eddie whistles) - That's good enough for me. I had my sights set on 25 thou when we started out. I'm ready to pull up stakes. - Yeah, well not me, baby. Look, that's fat city out there. m to tap it for at least 100,000 for just my share alone! Look, why stop now? Everything's goin' great. What do you say? - I say no. - That would really give you an up-yours stash. You wouldn't have to take any charters you didn't want. - I think we should settle for what we got, and get outta here while we can. - So, who's stoppin' us? With all the firepower we got, we could knock off the whole damn tribe if they start anything. n't planned on murdering anybody for the pearls, Logan. - Are you callin' me a murderer? Well, what did you have in mind, hem over the head with coconuts? - Alright, knock it off. This isn't gettin' us any place. You think you're foolin' anybody with that holier-than-thou crap? Hey, I know what you're up to. You plan on dumpin' us off on the mainland, and then you double back and get the rest of the pearls for yourself. - Stay behind if that's what's bothering ya. - Oh, yeah, you'd love that. ay here, the natives rip us off, and then you come back and get our share for no work at all. You're losin' your mind, Logan. - Cool it, damn it! Now, this is a business deal. Now, we can sit and talk like rational human beings. We're all equal partners, right? Okay, I've got the deciding vote and I vote we stay. When the pearls reach that line, ch man's share should be 50,000. That's when I'm leavin'. I own the boat. (peaceful music) What's the matter? - Nothing. are some things I must ask you. - Now? - They are very urgent, and I have very little time left to decide. s it like to live in your world? Because everything we do here, we do just to stay alive. If someone told me suddenly that I could live as long as I please, I would not know what to do with myself here. But if I lived in your world, perhaps in time I would be just like the others. I would have a chance to find a way for myself. To be a woman and not just a tool for survival. - You wanna get away from here? Okay, I'll help ya. - And then? - And then... - Would you love me always, keep me safe from harm? d you teach me a way for myself? Would you show me how to be valuable and worthy? - Syrene, look, I'll help you all I can, I want to, but I can't change my life very much for ya. (sighs) I don't love you. I don't love you. (gulls squawk) - We're going to be leaving the island soon, aren't we? - Mm-hm, why? - I'm afraid of this place. But I'm not really sure if I wanna leave just yet. - Well, there's nothin' to stop you from comin' back. With what you've found out, you should have no trouble scientific expedition together. - Would you like to be on it? - Uh, well, with all the people and equipment you'll be haulin' back here, you'll need a much bigger boat. - What if I asked you? - Now why would you do that? - Well, you've been here before, ow the waters around the island. And, um, you'd be a great help. - Yeah. - No, that's not what I meant. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I meant that... (peaceful music) - You will mate! You will mate! - Stop! - Father! - I can no longer protect you. You must mate. (moody music) - There's still another place. - You've been holdin' out. - It's very deep. ut it's got pearls in it, right? ording to the lore of my people, the resign channel has hundreds upon hundreds of pearls. - You've seen 'em? - No. But others in my village have. - What are we waitin' for? - It's very dangerous. - You only live once. - Make a killin', baby. Well, partner, what do you say? One for the road? - Okay, but just one dive. We leave after that, regardless of what happens. (suspenseful music) - What happened? - He ruptured his eardrums comin' up too fast, because he panicked when he ran out of air. - I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, go ahead. (pants) , it looks like it's you and me. (moody music) - Vic. Vic? Vic. Vic. - Baby, you did it! (laughs) Outta sight! - What? - Where is Syrene? - Syrene? I don't know, all I can remember is diving and... here, I, I must've blacked out. - Rapture of the deep. - What's that? - It's a kind of a high, first you feel lightheaded, then you black out. Where was Syrene all this time? sure, but I think she was there. - You've been diving for a long time, haven't you? his ever happened to you before? - Never. - Syrene is a lot like the sirens in mythology who lured sailors into a state of euphoria. - Just outside Kansas City? - Where's Kathy? - I don't know. I'll take that. Don't get that wet. (suspenseful music) (Kathy gasps) (dramatic music) (Kathy screams) Quick, get the bag! - Kathy, hold on! Cannibal fish, we need a rope. - I got one. - I got one. - Logan, tie the other end around my waist. - Logan, tie the other end around my waist. I got you. (peaceful music) - Boat. Nobody's at the boat! (suspenseful music) asn't somebody left on the boat? know I'm holding you personally responsible for this, Mathias. - You're holding me-- - Wait! - Senor Eddie! I've worried you've been on the island too long, so I come looking for you. Perhaps you need help. - Is that your boat, Manuel? - Yes, it is seated in a cove where they cannot find it. a half-mile due north from here. I've brought my large new boat. ght, man, well what do you want? Nobody does nothin' for nothin'. Come on, man, let's get this show on the road, how much? - A little reward, a small share of your pearls. 50 pearls, take it or leave it. Yeah, well not out of my share. , you stay here with your share. There's no way we're just gonna stroll down to Manuel's boat. - We need a diversion. ke the explosives to that temple that Kathy went to. We'll blow it up at dawn. Now, when they hear that, they'll run for it. We'll split like a bat outta hell for the cove. Probably have a mess of fightin' to do on the way. - You can't destroy the temple, it's sacred to them. - Well, my ass is sacred to me, so the temple blows up! We'll see you at the cove at a little after six. (suspenseful music) Come on. (villager groans) Come on! Give me the bag. Give me the bag! Give me the bag! Get the bag. Get the bag. (explosion roars) (villagers yell) (dramatic music) Let's go. (gun fires) (guns fire) Get down! (gun fires) (gun fires) (guns fire) (gun fires) (guns fire) ddie should've been here by now. I'm gonna give him a hand. - Go! (guns fire) (distant guns fire) (Vic groans) (Vic groans) (villager screams) (Syrene gasps and chokes) (Kathy coughs) (dark piano music) (Kathy sobs) - I didn't want to. I didn't want to. (sobs) - Syrene. (screams) (fire roars and crackles) (somber music) - I, I killed her. athy, before she could kill you. - And I destroyed, I destroyed my life, too. My whole life's work. A culture. A whole race of people. I made them extinct. - It didn't work, Mathias! Okay, this is as far as you go. Both of you back to the boat. the hell are you talkin' about? - You never give up, do ya? t you'd just sneak down here and tle con job on the king fisheye. little deal while the rest of us were busy packin' the gear. I've just about had it with you! - Come on! Come on, do it. (somber music) Damnit, I knew they had a stash, do you see that, Eddie? - Yeah, I see it. - So what? Let's get outta here. - It's a fortune! It's worth a king's ransom! It's no use to the dead. - Logan, no! - Take it easy, man. I'll handle it. - Hold it right there! Give me those pearls. I don't wanna hurt ya, but I will if I have to. - You want these pearls as well? You may have them. They are valueless to us now. They are yours. Take them. Take them. We will proceed (somber music) - Let go of that, Logan! Put it down! Let it go! Come on, let it go! Let go, let go! - I'll deal with it. - Bastard! - You wanna say somethin' to me? This is business, man, this what we came here for! Hell, if he caused any problem, I would've shot him! Hell, if he caused any problem, I would've shot him! - They got our weapons while we were asleep. ght, Manuel, what's comin' down? - This is my price for bringing you back to civilization! Pearls. aps I will give each one of you, 50 pearls. - And your soul to God. (dramatic music) (shipman groans) (gun fires) (Manuel groans) - No! (dramatic music) (men shout over each other) - Hey, Eddie. Listen, man, I got another proposition for ya. - Throw the rope! re's a lot of corral down there. It probably fell into a slot maybe 50 feet down. If it didn't go over the ledge. Look, even if it did, a couple of good divers oughta be able to cover the whole reef in a couple of weeks. Now, if it's not there, can come back with a demolition crew, and some dynamite. And we'll some winches, maybe, and a tugboat. can do it, Eddie, we really can. l take time and some more money, but hell, we've gone this far. We're gonna be rich, Eddie, we're gonna be rich! Rich!
