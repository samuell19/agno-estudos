Hear ye, great demons of Hell, watch over these, thy disciples. Give them Thy power over frail mankind! Thus, to be dedicate ourselves to your service and your command! We accept you guidance... ...and you mighty power! By the nameless monsters... ...of the lower depths are you called. Each time... the same... ...obscene. Some power. Some... Something greater than... You're sure John Porter was there? You're sure it was John Porter? Sure, and they had filthy obscene rites. A sort of altar. A young girl on it... naked, and she lies there, waiting for the sacrifice... ...a cockerel to be killed. Satan. They call on the name of the Devil. They seem... seem to take strength... ...in their own blasphemy. You want... proof? I've got photos. Five of them... ...all involved. All right. All right, now let's go through this again. Tell me more about this ritual. He should never have gone in. Putting him in as one of the guards, they must have been picked men. He was bound to be caught. He volunteered. Nobody volunteers in this department. Does he still maintain that John Porter was there? Yes, he seems to be certain about that. Porter and four others. Five men in all. It's going to make life difficult for all of us, isn't it? Because he's a Minister of the Crown? Because the Right Honorable John Porter... ...has direct responsibility for this department. Perhaps he just forgot about us. In any case we have no proof. No real proof. A group of middle aged men indulging themselves... ...in some sort of sick orgy. That's what we've got. Maybe the proof's in there? Even if it is, we don't know if we can use it. So that poor devil is simply suffering for absolutely nothing. That poor devil isn't suffering any longer. He's dead. It's a miracle he lasted as long as he did. Obviously he had been systematically beaten and tortured... Thank you, Doctor. Let me have your written report, later. I don't suppose anyone will be allowed to claim him, will they? The usual routine... false name on the death certificate. Inter-departmental whip-round for the burial. Would you like to hear this played back now, sir? - No, not now. - But leave it here. Get this down to the photo lab. Tell them to make prints of... ...anything that comes out. Anything at all. Have the tape transcribed later and... ...then put it in a red dossier and file it in the No. 2 security vault under "C." Yes, sir. No. 2 vault, eh? You really are going to close the door on this whole issue. I might I have to. So far as the Departmentâ€™s concerned, as far as I'm concerned... officially. What's that supposed to mean? I've called somebody in to give you a hand. Someone who doesn't have our resources... ...but does have a certain independence. Political independence. A man called Murray. - Inspector Murray. - Scotland Yard... ...Special Branch. Don't worry. He's all right. Knows his job. Well, that's comforting. Inside this room you have my blessing and my cooperation, outside your on your own, and I mean that. Put a foot wrong and the powers-that-be will finish you. You'll probably join Hanson. Thanks. We've been running some routine security checks... ...on certain listed V.I.P.'s. We got a whisper on the grapevine that some of them may have been... ...visiting a house in Croxstead Heath. Visiting it regularly. We didn't know who they were. This is the place, Pelham House. Headquarters of what has always been regarded as... ...a harmless organisation. Psychical Examination Research Group. PERG, for short. So you sent an officer in undercover? Yes, Hanson. He witnessed a couple of... pretty weird sessions. Hear ye, great demons of Hell. Watch over these, thy disciples. Give them thy power over frail mankind. Thus, do we dedicate ourselves to your service and... ...your command. Thus, with this baptism of blood... ...we walk in the eternal footsteps of the cursed. To know the inner secrets of those who move... ...beyond the realms of the unknown, and into the precincts of Hades. Yesterday they rumbled him and tried to make him talk. So they're alerted now. - What is it, an espionage network? - That must be our assumption. - Moscow or Peking? - Oh, we don't know. Nothing ties in. There's no single known link... ...and there's no whispers from any informers. From the photo lab. They found five exposures on the microfilm. A bit blurry, but they've given them special processing. - Right, thanks, Jane. - The transcription? All finished, sir. - Sealed and vaulted. - Thank you. You can't have had much rest in the last 12 hours. - You'd better cut along home. - Thank you, sir. Turn off the light as you go out, will you, Jane? Well? No doubt about that one. General Sir Arthur Freebourne, Imperial General Staff. Thus, by the six thousand terrors of Hell, are you anointed. Good lord! So Hanson was right. - That's Porter, isn't it? - Yes... ...the Right Honorable John Porter MP. Minister with special responsibilities for our... ...security services. Pity he didn't stick to collecting spiders. Thus, by the nameless monsters... ...of the lower depths are you called. A nod from him and a dozen civil service pensions... ...go out of the window. Including mine. He could dissolve this department in two seconds flat. So that's why you're working without official sanction. He's not too difficult either, Lord Carradine. Next to the Church and the Government, one of the biggest landowners in England. Still owns half of London. By the Seven Lords of Darkness are you damned. Professor Julian Keeley! - Not the Nobel Prize winner? - Yes, I'm sure it is. Expert in the fields of bacteriology... ...germ warfare and diseases of the blood. Runs the "Keeley Foundation" here in London. And seven times seven damned again. Thus, to defy the common laws of man and righteousness. There were five photos. Peter, let's have the fifth. What's this then? He slipped up over this one. He spoke of five men. Well, he was punchy. He'd had a hell of a beating. It's a wonder we got anything at all out of him. - It could only have been four. - It's enough. I'll have the dossiers released on Keeley and Porter and the others. I'll... see what can be dug up. I've never seen the Colonel nervous. Perhaps the Colonel's never had quite so much provocation before. The Baptism of Blood... ...it acts on them like... like some kind of drug. The girl dies. The woman... puts a cloak over her... ...over the... the blood. The blood pour... pour... pouring... ...from the wound. There's blood ev... Blood. What? There's a man I worked with once. He's an academic type, but... ...he knows about this sort of thing. Professor Lorrimer Van Helsing. He's a University Lecturer in anthropology... ...and Eastern European history. He's a scientist. But what may prove to be even more important to us, he's an authority on the occult. He really knows about the black arts, satanic rites and... And what? Other things. Crosses... They have inverted crosses... ...marked in blood... and... ...as the woman goes to the altar... ...there's a strange power there... ...filling the whole house. I felt it, strong, weird, powerful. Death is no prison for those who have given their souls... ...to the Prince of Darkness. Hobgoblins and witches and things that go bump in the night. Well, yes. Well, Hobgoblins are fancy creatures of the nursery, Mr. Torrence. As for witches, they certainly exist, although 90% of them are charlatans. Things do go bump in the night... quite often. Well, what do you think, Professor? Was it just a Black Mass ritual? No. No, not exactly. In the Dark Ages the worship of natural substances... ...was quite common. The soil, water, the sand of the desert, various plants. But the strongest cults were those that worshipped... ...the most mystical substance of all: the fountainhead of life itself, the glorification of blood. Thank you. And more often than not... ...human blood. Now what your man Hanson witnessed... ...was a rather ancient ritual ceremony. It has all the elements: The slaughter of the cockerel, the inherent vileness of evil triumphant, the obscenities, the marking of the supplicants, the human sacrifice. Now that, of course, could be faked. But it's the symbolism that counts. The worship of blood. Well, I can understand young kids taking a flyer, just for kicks, but... ...we're talking about sophisticated, mature adults. It isn't unique. The notorious Hellfire Club of the 18th Century... ...was comprised solely of the elite brains of this country. The wisest men of Asia were firmly convinced... ...that human blood was the elixir of youth, and those who adhere to the cult of vampirism... ...are usually sophisticated, mature adults. These are the people who fully realise its tremendous potential. One of these men could be the motivating force, the menace... and the power. Are these men involved in this whole business... ...because they're under some kind of threat? - Or drugs? - Or hypnosis. This particular evil is more potent and more addictive than heroin, I assure you. And the end result is just as fatal. I'd like to see inside Pelham House. - Yes, but they're already alerted. - Coffee, Grandfather? What a pleasant surprise. Thank you. You know my Granddaughter, Inspector? Yes, indeed. - Nice to see you again, Jessica. - Hello. - Jessica, this is Mr. Peter Torrence. - Excuse me. Jessica is my right hand. Sometimes I think she knows more about my work than I do myself. There's little sense in trying to keep secrets from her. She has an ingrained curiosity. The hallmark of a true scientist. Do you take milk and sugar in your coffee, Mr. Torrence? No, plain black. Thank you. Well, I still think it would be worth a trip out to Croxstead Heath. - What? - Pelham House. I'd still like to take a look inside. Oh, Professor Julian Keeley. - You know him? - I've met him. He's been here once or twice, but you know him Grandfather. You know him very well. - Is that true, sir? - Yes, I know him. We met at Oxford. He was reading biochemistry. When I saw that photograph I just couldn't believe it. Not Keeley! I was going to tell you... later. Old college chums and all that? I though I might see him first, speak to him. Find out if he's really involved. - Why not? - Hey? Well, it's worth a try. The chances are that a friend could get more out of him than you or I. Yes, it's worth a try. Julian? I finished! It's all finished, I've finished it! Hello Julian. It's Lorrimer. Oh... Lorrimer? Lorrimer Van Helsing. - You told me, anytime I was passing... - Lorrimer... Van Helsing... ...it's not terribly convenient just now. - What I mean is... - I'm sorry, I happened to be... - ...in the neighbourhood... - ...I'm busy. ...and just thought I'd pop in... On what? What are you working on these days? I must say you have some splendid equipment here. - I'm sorry if I startled you. - I was concentrating! Leave that, will you! - What's wrong, Julian? - Nothing. Nothing. I'm... ...just a bit tense, Lorrimer. You know... sleepless nights. Mental fatigue. I... I have been ill. A sort of temporary breakdown, but I'll be over it soon. My dear chap, I'm so sorry. The project, I had a deadline, you see, It had to be completed by the 23rd of this month. Always fighting the clock, but I did what they wanted me to and I've still time to spare. All the answers just came... ...quite suddenly. It happens like that occasionally, doesn't it? There is... There's still time before the 23rd, isn't there? Evil rules, you know. It really does. Evil and violence are the only two measures that hold any power. Look at the world. Chaos. It is a preordained pattern. Violence, Greed, Intolerance, Sloth, Jealousy. The Deadly Sins. Or the Deadly Virtues. The Supreme Being is The Devil, Lorrimer. Serve him and he offers you immortality. He'll remove Death... the Common Enemy! Nothing is too vile. Nothing is too dreadful, too awful. You need to know the terror, the horror, Lorrimer. You need to feel the thrill of disgust. The beauty... of obscenity. Julian! In God's name! What is it you're working on? We deny it although we say we don't! Julian! - Help me! Help me, Lorrimer! - Julian! These notes, they refer to a new strain of Bacillus Pestius. Bubonic Plague! The Black Death! Not a cure for it, not a preventative technique... - ...but a means of accellerating it! - I can just say... ...I had to do it! I found the new strain. Bacillus Pestius... ...but more virulent than any known species. I grew the bacilli in agar... ...and then exposed them to radio-active neutrons. An infected creature... ...suffers the most indescribable symptoms. The flesh... literally rots from the bones, and the contagion spreads by touch, like wildfire! Everything accelerates beyond any imagination. Within seconds, the disease takes over the whole system. And the bacilli is growing in these petri dishes? They are now fully matured. They can like in a saline solution indefinitely. Why the plague bacillus, Julian? You, Professor Julian Keeley, awarded... ...the Nobel Prize for science and humanity! Why, Julian? You're going to tell me who commissioned you to work on this... ...this atrocity! And what's so important to you and to them... ...about the 23rd of this month. Otherwise I shall have no alternative, but to report this whole matter to higher authorities! Don't blame me! It's not my fault! He threatened me. My work's all finished. Dear god. Look, you heard what my Grandfather said. I know his work. I might spot something... - ...you could overlook. - I'm sorry, Jessica, it's... - ...just out of the question. - We're not playing games. Actually there is a way you can be of use to us, Jessica. - How? - By waiting here. And if by some chance we shouldn't be back within an hour... ...get onto Gasby at the Island 3-5-6... ...and tell him what happened, will you? And... ...be quiet. State your name and business, please. Murray. Inspector Murray. Police. Well, you are the law. What is it? - Police, ma'am. - Police? What can the police possibly want with us? Well, apparently there was some sort of disturbance... ...in the roadway just outside your gates, last night. Some nearby residents complained. There are no nearby residents. It was a very still night, perhaps the sound carried. Didn't you hear anything? Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. Some hooligans on motorcycles. I hardly thought it worth reporting. Well, the complainants felt that the hooligans might be using this house... ...as a rallying point. It's ridiculous, of course, but... ...we have to look into these things. How very bizarre! They are supposed to hide in the dark corners of Pelham House, are they? Oh, please, let's get out of here! Oh, please, take me away! Peter, please! Oh, don't leave me here! - Oh, please, help me! - Jane! Help me! Stop him! She's a vampire! Peter! Pull yourself free, man! Keeley behaved like a man demented, obsessed. Utterly lost. All but the last vestige of sanity had left him. His words were prompted by some force, some... ...some nightmare outside himself. It is a shadow, a spectre that haunts us all. Murray, why the hell didn't you get your people to raid Pelham House? Should have called them the moment you got out of the damned place. - Well, as a matter of fact, I... - I'm sorry Colonel. Inspector Murray was quite right. By the time the police would have got there, they would have found nothing. Nothing? What about that... ...Chinese woman? What about all of those... ...unfortunate creatures in the cellar? We are not dealing with ordinary criminals, Colonel Mathews. Nor with enemy agents. These people have powers beyond anything you can imagine. It didn't help Professor Keeley. Well, he's out of it now, anyway. One down and three to go. The Keeley Foundation... ...who started it? Whose money's behind it? Thank you. Some tycoon called Denham. D. D. Denham. There's very little known about him. He lives in the heart of the Denham Building. No thank you. He allows no press interviews, no photographs... - A recluse. - Denham. Mean something? A link, possibly a major one. Yes, here we are. The Denham Group of Companies. Chemicals, oils, banks. Board of Directors, Denham himself. The Right Honorable John Porter. - Lord Carradine. - General Freebourne. And Keeley. And Uncle Tom Cobley and all! This man, Denham, perhaps Hanson was right. I think he was. You've already seen a manifestation of vampirism. The cult lives, it breeds, it spreads its vileness like a contagion. Like the plague. My family has fought this corruption for generations. Each time it was destroyed, so has it risen again, like the Phoenix, but hellbent on revenge. Only this time... This time I believe it's not merely a personal vendetta... ...but something infinitely more far reaching. The plague bacillus, Pelham House, the... ...mental destruction of intellectuals such as Professor Keeley and the others... ...it is all an integral part of a means to a definite end. The real force, the shadow I spoke of... ...is more sinister, more obscene than any monstrosity you can think of. Lord of Corruption, Master of the Undead... ...Count Dracula. Is there really such a creature? You should have been in that bloody cellar, Colonel! Incredible. My department is being closed down, orders of John Porter, half my staff have been arrested, two have been killed, they've labelled us subversives, and the heavies are damned well looking for us, and all this because of a... ...a vampire? Van Helsing, for God's sake! - Jessica, you should be resting. - Oh, I'm all right, Grandfather. Thank you. I destroyed Count Dracula once. It was more than two years ago in Saint Bartolph's churchyard. This creature can live again... ...by reincarnation. It requires a disciple. Someone well versed in the ritual. - The Chinese woman, Chin Yang? - Possibly. She would have to know the exact location of Dracula's grave. I passed the site of Saint Bartolph's tonight. The churchyard has long since vanished. An office block has been built there, now. That new building is about two years old. Well, if it's been there for two years... That means this thing has been around since then. So it would seem. And those women in the cellar, their names have probably been on the files of your... ...Missing Persons Bureau for two years. Anyway, that new office block belongs to the Denham Group of Companies. Now, I don't know whether... ...the fifth guest was D. D. Denham, but this I do know: Vampires are spectral creatures. Their image casts no reflection in a mirror. Nor can the lens of a camera record their likeness. So there was someone there. Or some thing. Norman Hanson saw it but his camera couldn't record it. How the hell do you fight a vampire? With cloves of garlic? There are many ways. The symbols of good are used to combat the forces of evil. The crucifix, The word of God as written in the Holy Bible. Clear running water, symbolizing purity, and it lives in mortal dread of silver. - Anything else? - The Hawthorn tree... ...which provided Christ with his crown of thorns, the light of day... And a wooden stake driven through the heart. What about the 23rd, the day that Keeley mentioned... Yes indeed. The 23rd of this month. That I fear is the worst of all. It is the Sabbat for the Undead. What significance is that? There are satanic circles which govern our fate, and the fate of this earth. Perhaps even the universe. Now, throughout history... ...there are certain times, certain dates which... ...are marked by awesome catastrophes. Each event is carefully plotted, and a definite pattern emerges. Every disaster this world has ever suffered... ...coincides with a point wherein these circles meet... ...and cross. In this century alone they heralded the outbreak of... ...two devastating world wars. And another disaster is imminent? - Could be. - The 23rd. - That's the day after tomorrow. - This must happen tomorrow... - ...at midnight. - Why, it's even sooner. At that hour the Devil holds a balance of power. He marshals his disciples. The living and the dead. In satanic covens it is the celebration of supreme blasphemy. The Sabbat of the Undead. I've heard of the witches sabbat. No, this date is much more important. It's more profound. Even more significant than the night of Walpurgis. Now Keeley said the... ...bacillus had to be ready by the 23rd. Why? The date chosen by Dracula himself. The 23rd day of this 11th month. The emerging patterns. The night of the soulless ones. And in the turmoil and fear that follows, a group of... warped men emerge to take control. A politician, a soldier, an industrialist, a landowner. But Dracula would eventually end up with a totally barren earth! With only disease and dead bodies to feed on... ...surely even the vampire himself would perish. Perhaps deep in his subconscious, that is what he really wants. An end to it all. He is a cursed immortal, existing on violence, fear and dread. Now suppose... Now just suppose he yearns for final peace. What then? He'd want to bring down the whole universe with him! The ultimate revenge! Thousands dying of the plague, like the shadow of death itself, one figure scything its way... ...through the terror and anguish. Count Dracula. It is the Biblical prophecy of Armageddon. Nothing. Nothing at all. It all seems so unbelievable by the light of day. But it's not. Well, what's going on? Not doing any good hanging around here. Professor Van Helsing is still at home... ...and I'm with the Colonel down in the car. All this damned hanging around. Yes, I know. Well, they're all right, sir, a bit impatient of course, but... Colonel? It'll be getting dark soon. We should have heard something by now. It's a sniper! Get down! That was a bullet! - I didn't hear a shot. - He's using a silencer. Could be anywhere. Better get the hell out of here. If he gets us pinned down... Run like hell! Come on Jessie, the road can't be far away. I can't! Look, Jessica, he's only playing with us. He could pick us off at any time. Now, come on. Come on! Thank God the Colonel's car is still there, come on! Come on Colonel, let's get the engine started! Let's get moving! Good evening. I'd like to see Mr. Denham. Mr. D. D. Denham. I'm sorry sir, no one sees Mr. Denham. No one at all. - Ever. - If you were to... ...mention my name I'm sure he would see me. - Van Helsing. - Waste of time, sir, I assure you. Excuse me. Security reception. Yes, sir, but my standing instructions... Yes, sir. You're to go up to Mr. Denham's private apartment, sir! Thank you. Doesn't that thing make you feel self conscious? All part of the job. Take the lift and press the... the red button. It'll stop right outside his suite. And sir, um, you... ...you're not carrying a camera, are you? - My instructions... - No, no camera. - Professor Van Helsing. - Mr. Denham. I have been expecting you. I rather thought you might. Please sit down. I have been expecting you ever since Julian Keeley took his own life. Or was he murdered? He was... a servant of this foundation. I am the master. His nerves failed him. The project he was working on was enough to shatter... ...anyone's nerve. It is merely a deterrent. Nothing more. There is a group of us, who are determined that the decadence of the present day... ...can and will be halted. A new political regime is planned. To lend weight to one's arguments... ...amid the rush and whirl of humanity... ...it is sometimes necessary to be persuasive. Persuasive? Ah, there are a few vague rituals, it is true. A little occultism, a touch of mysticism... ...at Pelham House, nothing more. Evil begets evil. There is an unholy aura in this place, and it is not a question of a little occultism... ...or a touch of mysticism, Mr. Denham. It is vampirism, and there's a host of damned souls at Pelham House. What are you going to do with me? You can't let me go, can you? I know too much. Do you mind if I smoke? It's bad habit I know, but... ...helps me to concentrate. I'm sorry. Am I to suffer the same fate as Professor Keeley? You are an interfering man, Professor. Do not meddle... ...or you will have to deal with me. You are Count Dracula! Of course! Mr. Denham, the powerful recluse! Here you're safe. No one expects to see him! Not in the daytime. Glory to God alone. If not the Lord, it is in vain! Foolish man. Bullets cannot harm me. A silver bullet, Dracula. - Kill him! - He's threatened you! It cannot be made so simple for him. Not for Van Helsing. Nor for his Granddaughter. - Where's Jessica? - I have her hidden away. Well, I suggest you go find her! I would have promise you, but first you must help me. Help you? I too want to get away from this place. I'm as much a prisoner as you are. Yeah, but... but you live here. Not by choice. In God's name! Jessica! Please, God. On this, the Eve of the Sabbat... ...of the undead... ...I call upon you to witness... ...my supreme triumph. Van Helsing, I choose the spawn of your blood... ...to be my consort. The instrument of my final conquest. Swifter, more awesome than the Black Death. The Plague! In the first moments, every muscle... ...every fibre will be afire with... ...torment and agony. In the days to come... ...you will... pray... for death... ...for release. And so you destroy every living soul on this earth... ...and left with an empty world to command. Is that what you want, Count Dracula? A last blaze of utter horror and violence? The ghastly annihilation of an entire planet? Is this your own death wish? I have chosen four messengers of death! Four horsemen of my created apocalypse! Four carriers of the plague who will infect their miserable brethren! You, Van Helsing, are now one of the four! The body of your Granddaughter... ...will never be corrupted. It will be her joy... ...to walk at my side. Four carriers? Us? You mean us? You said we would use the plague only as a deterrent! To hold governments to ransom! - You promised us power! - We served you faithfully! Silence! The girl that you love is mine already, and through her you will yet... ...do my bidding. In your name! For you! Everything! We did exactly as we were commanded! In return you... promi... Oh, no! Are you open for any deals? Hurry! Get Jessica away! Get her away, man! Hurry! My revenge has spread over centuries and has just begun! Jessica! Jessica! How the hell do you fight a vampire? There are many ways. The symbols of good are used to combat the forces of evil. The Hawthorn tree which provided Christ with his crown of thorns... Count Dracula! Dracula! Dracula!
