Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes That must be it. Dear God, help me to work hard and not lose my temper... ...and preserve me from all matter of evil. Good afternoon, miss. Hello. Going Woodview way, miss? - Yes. - Mind if I come with you? No. Come on, miss, I'll show you a shortcut. I'll carry your bag, miss. Let me walk behind you, miss, just till we reach cover. Spread your skirts out, miss. Demon! Run! Go on! Get on and run! Go on, run! Run faster! Run! Leave that boy alone! What's he done to you? Nice little rat. He's supposed to be running. We're getting his weight down. Getting his weight down? He's skin and bone already. Come on. He's got to ride a good one. Who are you, may I ask? - Esther Waters. - Ah, the new kitchen maid. Esther. I like that. I'll take your bundle. Feels like books. I'm William. William Latch. I suppose the rest of your stuff's down at the storage. - You work here? - Footman. But I'm doing groom just to oblige the gaffer. - Who's the gaffer? - Squire Barfield. Of course, Mum is set against him. She wants me to be a shopkeeper. But I want to be where the horses are. It's the only way to get the real information, don't you agree? That's him. The gray one in front. That's Silver Braid. They look very thin for carriage horses. Carriage horses? - You've been right round the estate? - Yes. That's the old hatchet face up there. That's Mr. Randal. He's the butler. He's been here since you can't remember. They say he's got thousands sorted away somewhere... ...he got off tips he got from the gaffer. - Now do you see what I'm after? - No, I don't. Have you never seen a racehorse before? No. Do they belong here? Why, Squire Barfield's one of the best-known trainers in Sussex. Haven't you ever heard of Woodview racing staples? Is there betting in that? What are they staring at me for? Don't be silly, it's not you, it's the horses. Come on, she'll be off and needs the key. Here she is. Esther. Why are you so late? Six people to dinner and me without a kitchen maid. It's no blame on Esther if her train was late. I suppose you kept her. With your everlasting brag and boast... ...and setting your cab at any girl that takes your eye? Esther indeed! Esther indeed. Well, I declare. I suppose I've got to call you Miss Tucker. And Margaret, she's to be Miss Gayle, eh? - And you... - Just call me Grover, if you please. Yes, I suppose even your mum is not allowed to use your front name. I won't be in for supper. I'm going down to Shoreham. To get my uniform. I'll pick up your trunk at the station, Esther. Don't stand there! Stir yourself! Start on those vegetables! If you'll excuse me, ma'am, my working things aren't here yet. Humph! What you've got on won't come to much by the looks of it. Whoa, there! Where are you going to? I'll not stay here to be insulted. You've got a terrible temper, my girl. Don't you my girl me. Let me by, I'm going. There's no train till the morning. - Well, I'll walk then. - Now, come on, Esther. It's not you Mum's mad at, it's me. - Your mother? - Yes. All that talk about the uniform that did it. I told you I was. Here, get this on a cool off. She's not a bad sort as soon as you know her. - Cluttering up the doorway! - Here, Mr. Randal... - How's the child going, Mr. Randal? - Is he ready for the next race, Mr. Randal? Was he tired over the mire, Mr. Randal? What does the gaffer think now, was he pleased, do you think? A curse, that's what it is, all this chatter! What business have a lot of females to do with horses? I'll thank you all to keep outside my pantry. Not me, Mr. Randal. Oh! Oh, you've come to your senses, have you? I want the potatoes to start with. And then you're to stew cabbage. And I want warm plates for nine for the dining room. Quite a simple dinner, only six courses. Then there's twelve to be laid for in the servant's hall. "The moment Jonquil heard the turning of the key in the ancient rusty lock... ...she knew she was the victim of a fiendishly contrived plan. As the count slowly advanced towards her, she noticed that his smile, which had appeared so frank and reassuring in the Bluebell wood, now positively distorted his pale and handsome features. Suddenly the count's arms were about her... ...and she felt his breath come hot upon her cheek. Jonquil, he whispered, fate has intended you for me and me for you. And at that moment, she swooned into his arms." - Go on. - That's all for this month. Oh, what a shame. I do think it's such a lovely story. Don't you, Esther? We think such tales are simple rubbish. Oh? Who's we? Chapel folk. And are chapel folk let read at all? Esther's brought lots of books with her. - Sinful books? - Good books. They were my father's. And what are they about? Well? What are they about? Read the first five lines of that. I won't. It's evil. Can you? What is it, Esther? - Can't you read? - No indeed she can't, the ignorant baggage! All she can do is preach. Godless, you're godless! Look at her, setting herself up in judgment! Godless, godless! Stop that shouting! And where's my cup of tea? Get your own tea! Nice piece of trouble you've caused, I must say! Follow me. Never, never don't you pass through this door... ...without you're properly accompanied. Come on. Madam will see you now. I'm here, Waters. Pretty, aren't they? Yes, ma'am. Now, Waters, I understand you're not very happy here. No, ma'am. I wonder why. I meant to keep my wicked temper, ma'am, really I did. But I started off wrong and it got worse no matter what I did. Anyhow, I think you're meant to send me away. Oh, my dear child, what do mean by "meant"? I don't think I should stay here. I was brought up to think that racing and gambling and such things are wicked. - We are chapel folk. - So am I. - You're a Meth? - Why not? In this house? What is your name? - Esther. - Well, Esther, When we begin to get on in life, some of the rough edges are worn away. like pebbles in a brook. And so, without weakening in our own beliefs, we're not so anxious to change everybody. We leave that to someone else. But isn't that like forgetting your religion? No, it's just one way of forgetting oneself. Now, Esther, you mustn't think because everyone here hasn't our faith... ...that they're all bad. Try to recognize and bring out the good in people. Our Lord did, you know. Yes, ma'am There. Now come with me. I thought with a little alteration this might suit you. Oh... - Like it? - Oh, thank you, ma'am. Now off you go, and try to make friends with the others. Yes, ma'am. There's no heath there anyway, but the goings like iron. - Yes, sir. - Demon, you've got to get that weight down. Try as I will, I can't seem to get them last ounces off, sir. Ounces? Pounds you mean. What we get off him on the road he puts on again in the grub room. No, I never! I thought so. Someone watching us. - William! - Yes, sir? Just sneak up that hill round the bushes and warn off that tout. Right, sir. Thought you was a tout. Well, I was watching. Was it wrong? Watching our carriage horses? Tsk-tsk-tsk. - Mrs. Latch gave me the afternoon off. - Did she? I thought you two would work together in earnest. - You're steady, she says. - You shouldn't laugh at your mother. Poor old Mum. Here, come and have a look. See that? The Latch estates. You know, once upon a time the Latches owned the lot. The Barfields was nothing then. Latches up, Barfields down. - But now... - How did it happen, William? Well, my granddad was a bit of a masher. When he left my father larked with racing, and drinking and... You know. - And your mother, was she always? - In service? No. No, her old man was a yeoman farmer, his own boss. She was a steady girl. She hoped my dad would retrieve the family fortunes, but... he liked his bet on the horses. Only he chose the wrong ones. - Poor William. - Don't you believe it. Do you know what? I'm going to put the Latches back where they belong. And you know why? Because I'm lucky. If only it isn't another dry storm. We'd best find some cover. Welcome to Latch Manor. Make yourself at home. Take a seat. Listen. It is! Rain! Buckets of it, for Barfield and old Goldwood. Listen, if the going's soft at Goldwood, Silver Braid will walk it. The money's stacked on him now at thirty-threes. Woodview money, of course. Nobody else knows anything about that horse. William, have you bet much? More than I can afford to lose. But I don't think I shall. And that's only the start, see? And if I bet careful for a couple of years... get a bit of capital, you... You know what? What? I shall buy a pub. A nice little pub on the south coast. - To drink? - Not just that. When you got a pub you can build up a business bookmaking. But, William, what good will that do to you? Esther, don't you understand? Betting's a mug's game unless you lay the odds yourself. In five years I could lay by a nice little fortune making a book... Can't you see it? Right across the pages in the pinker. "Lucky Latch gets back his estate." - Oh, William, I hope Silver Braid wins. - Oh, Esther! What's the matter with you? I thought you was against racing and all that. I don't know. I've heard so much since I've been here. Maybe I've changed. Well, it has set alright, we'd better make a run for it. Come on, take my coat. There you are. All right? Down! Come on, run... Now look here, Demon, everything else is right... ...and we're going to get your weight right. Let me mind my own business! - There you are! - Let me go! I'll get my weight down, I tell you I will. Oh, you murderers! Oh, you're burning me! Hush, little mate. Be good, Demon! I'll give you a nice piece of real meat if you're a good boy. That's right. Have you got anything on Silver Braid, William? Just a little something, miss. All aboard? Right, William, let them go. Did William tell you what he had on today? - No. - No, they never do. - Oh, but he's bound to win. - Yes... His father was a lucky Latch before him. Are you fond of that fool boy of mine, Esther? He was kind to me when nobody else was. I know. That's all past now, Esther. The lad needs a woman to keep him straight. A strong-minded one. Were you? Did you hear? William! Help me down. - I told you I was lucky, didn't I? - You are. Esther, wait a minute. That's the shilling I borrowed from you on Monday. - But it's 30 shillings, William. - Yes, I know. I put it on Silver Braid. I told you I was Lucky Latch. That's the first turn of the cards. One moment, please. In honor of Silver Braid... the master is holding a servants' ball in the Swiss Gardens at Shoreham. Guess who you're going with? Oh, Sara, you don't think it's too... - Too... - Don't be silly. Oh, Esther! Where did you get that? It was the shilling William put on Silver Braid for me. Brace me up, Ducky. Ladies and gentlemen, take your partners for the grand waltz. (Both together) Isn't it like you? Margaret. Poor William. How long will milady keep that up? As long as poor William does that. Esther, please, people are saying things. - Let them, if what you said was true. - Well, of course it was true. How can we get married on nothing? I don't want my wife to be in service all her life. - I want her to have a home of her own. - A home? On a groom's wages? I don't expect a whole more to go out of service. All I want is a man who does what he says. Esther! I've only got three pounds. But if I did set for the ledger, and if it comes off, and it looks like it's certain, it'll be alright. So that's it! If I'm to be true woman or not, the horses are to say. - How else will I get the money then? - You won't need any money now. I wouldn't marry a man who'd take my love and risk it on a horse race. No more than I'd take a wife when I tell her like fair and decent... ...and turns everything I say into dirt. Sarah was right. You'd make any man's life a misery. Oh, William. William! William! Coming, miss. You're late. I told you to have the horse ready at a quarter past ten. They were ready. Am ready. Don't be impudent. Take your hat. William. - Yes, miss? - Are you coming? Yes, miss. Whoa, there. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy, whoa. Your ledger went down at Shoreham. Your horse was placed. Placed is nothing to me. I wasn't on it for a place, I was on it for a win. Did he win? - No. - He didn't. Well, that's the last bob of mine on Lucky Latch's certainties. - You said he couldn't go wrong. - He was placed, wasn't he? I wish you'd keep your platitudes to yourself. Come on, how much did you lose? A shilling. We can't all bet in quids. William, I must speak to you. No one's stopping you. Not here. It's not about the race. I'm sorry for that. I bet you are. Well, I suppose I'd better go and answer that, I... I'll see you later. Bye, Mr. Randal, that horse looks younger than yours. I didn't know they'd be ringing, I thought they was all out. Not Miss Peggy isn't. Quite a stout old marm Miss Peggy's becoming. Mr. Williams developed a proper shop here for the belles too. Well, I don't think much of ladies that run after their servants, if you ask me. Esther... Esther, please, you've got to listen to me. Please, I'll try to explain to you... Get where you belong. - Did you have a nice afternoon, dear? - Very nice. Esther! Water, quick. - What's happened? - William. And Miss Peggy. Oh, Esther dear. We'll look after you. We'll look after you. When Mr. Leopold told the gaffer, he was that wild... ...he told him to pay William off and he was to leave that instant. Serves him right. Esther, you're to stay in bed, Mrs. Latch said so. I've got to see somebody. I'll go for you. - Who is it? - You can't. It's Miss Peggy. Something she must know. But Esther... Oh, I have to tell you. When William went, they found she'd gone too. Together? What did you want to tell her, Esther? Something about me... and about William too. I never told him. Oh, Esther. Oh, you poor, poor lamb. We'll all look after you, really we will. - That's not your work, Esther. - The boy's out on an errand, ma'am. Anyhow, you shouldn't be doing it... should you? Why haven't you told me, Esther? - That I'm with child, ma'am? - I've been waiting. Come here, Esther. Sit down. I hate deceiving you, m'am. But you might have sent me away and I have to have the wages. I have another to think of for now. - I've done my work. - It's not that. I might have been able to help you. - Do you wish to go on staying here? - No, ma'am, thank you. I've eight pounds saved now. I can go home if I can pay my stepfather my keep. Yes, I can go home. Thank heaven you have a home to go to, my poor child. - You've heard nothing of William? - No, ma'am. My baby's what matters now. I'd like you to take this, Esther. Yes, for your child. You've been more than kind, ma'am. May I ask one thing more? Would you pray for me? Tell me, Esther. Have you truly repented? I loved him, ma'am. But what I did was wrong. I'm sorry. Shall I read something to you? Perhaps some of the most beautiful words in the world. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. What do you want? - Is Mother out? - Who? My mother. Oh, her that was here before. Gone. Eh, what are you getting at? She passed away, didn't she? Passed away? You said it was your mother, didn't you? - Name? - Waters. - E. Waters? - Yes. Oh, shut it, can't you? Do you mind? Put that down. Yes, now brush under the bed there. - Good morning! - Good morning. Now hurry up, because we want that this afternoon. Morning, Waters. How's Jacky? Oh, hiccups, so he's thriving. Well, I'm glad to see you looking so well because we want your bed. What are your plans now? I haven't made any yet. Well, you've got to get back to service, you know. You mustn't waste no more time. - But what about Jacky? - Jacky! All you girls should think of that before you have your Jackys. Now look, you just have to board him out. Now, there's a bit of luck for you, Waters. Mrs. Rivers wants a new between maid. - Mrs. Rivers? - Her husband's on the Board of Guardians... ...they are very charitable people, they are. Fourteen pounds a year, they're paying. That's quite enough for a girl in your position. Suits you? Go where I tell you, be there Friday. But what about the baby? Oh, he'll soon get a woman to take him for six a week. Ask one of the girls here. Now up you get and practice your leggypegs. - Yes, matron. - Out you go tomorrow. Well, Waters is sorted out. Thank you, Waters, that will do. Miss. Miss, Mrs. Spire said to tell you your baby needs a doctor. - And can't he have five shillings. - Jacky! What's wrong with him? Send that child away! Go away, little girl! Tell Mrs. Spires I'll come as soon as I can. Waters, come here at once. How dare you talk to slum children on my doorstep. She came to say my baby's ill. Please, ma'am, I must go at once. Baby's ill? You must finish your work first, and then we'll see. But they've had to send for the doctor, ma'am. In that case, there's nothing more for you to do. I'm worried, ma'am, it may be serious. Serious? Don't you realize you may bear some dreadful infection back to my child? On second thought you'd best not go at all. What if it was your child? What if you were in my place? We needn't consider impossibilities, Waters. You seem to forget why I took you here and in what circumstances. I shall ask Mr. Rivers if I should keep you on. In the meantime, continue your work. I must go and see Jacky, ma'am. You won't return if you do. Very good, ma'am, I won't return. You'll forfeit your wages and I'll have your box thrown into the street. I daresay you'd do that, too... if you weren't afraid of the law. The insolence! Is he any better, Mrs. Spires? Frightening me like that. Coming into other people's houses without so much as a by or leave. Sorry, but I was a bit worried about Jacky. Did you get the doctor? Without you sending the money? Haven't I always others to see to? He's thinner than when I left. You don't expect a child to do quite so well without it's mother. That's cold. That'll upset him. Well, I'm going to warm it by the fire, ain't I? And it ain't for yours, it's for the other one. Poor little Mike. It ain't long for this world. I wouldn't be took aback if it weren't before the moment. Good, goody boy. You can't help feeling sorry for the little angels. And them not even baptized. But I often think it's meant. For what have they got to look forward to? And I often say to myself I'm their best friend. To let them go off, quiet. Hello! Good little boy. Got the money for the doctor then? I haven't got my first month's wages yet. I know. Beginning to feel the drag. What do you mean? You thinks of nothing but the babies at first. Then you wishes they'd never been born. Or died, before they knew what it was to live like. Listen to me, and I'll be your friend. I'll do for you what I've done for others. Five pounds is all I ask. Five pounds? I haven't got five shillings. What for? You tell your mistress you're going to have the child adopted. She'll stump it up out of your wages. To get it out of your mind once and for all. It's in her interest, don't you see? Well, it's kindness to him. So that's what you're doing. What's on your mind? Find any offer to have it adopted for five pounds? Murder. So that's it. What's that? Mind what you say. I don't want no arguments. Just pay what you owes and take yourself off before I change me mind. Hey! No you don't! - What's going on? - She's making horrid accusations! And leaving without paying. No one takes an apple out of here without their pays. If you think you can come here insulting me wife. I know what you're doing here, getting rid of them for money. - You take that back! - Let her go, we don't want the police! We'll hand her over, will teach you to thieve. Never mind, Thomas, only two days' money. Best be rid of her. Well, take your rook. And if you open your mouth! Take it easy. Nearly killed you was. And the baby. You shouldn't have him out this time of night. She wanted five pounds to kill him. Say, what's that? Who did? That's how she lives. Doing away with people's babies they don't want. Come along young woman, this is 1875. Those things don't happen now. Seems to me you want looking after. Haven't you got a home? No. And nowhere to go? I think I'll better send you along to my sister Florie. Goody, goody, goody. There you go. Florie fixed you up then? I just looked in to see what's what. Thanks, Florie. This kept me an hour of my duty, this has. - The kid don't look none the worse. - It's all been arranged, Jimmy. Jacky's staying here with his auntie Florie, while little mommy finds lots of nice work to do. The gentlewoman who aspires to an orderly-run establishment... would be well-advised to keep a firm hand on the rein. Impress upon every member of the domestic staff, the necessity of early rising. Let's get up. Make her wear gloves, to sweep, clean grates, etc., that her hands may be fit to serve a table. Insist on housemaid's work be done in the morning... ...and her dress changed before lunch. Thrift should be encouraged. Press your servants to lay by at least half their wages in the savings desk. - I kept a shilling back for breakages. - Than you, ma'am. Allow, no perquisites, but let your servants have the benefit of your cast-off clothes. Above all, satisfy yourself as to the moral deportment of your maid... ...in the interest of both parties. Esther! Taking advantage of my poor boy's innocence? Pack your box and go. Those households are best conducted... ...where the mistress never converses with her servants. Never speaks but to gently give an order, ask a question, or say good morning and evening to her maids. Still doing the steps? Well, you told me to do them again, ma'am. But there is this consolation for us. That He took the hard way too. He began life like a simple craftsman, just like any one of us. A fellow worker, you might say. And right from that humble start he's shown us... it doesn't much matter what we're at, I mean what sort of a job we've got, even what we get out of it. It's what we put into it. That's the thing that counts for us. It's the point of view, isn't it? It's the point of view that turns all our work into an offering. A prayer. If we can do this, we can consider ourselves blessed. Why, because we are free men and free women. As Saint Paul says, If any man among you seemeth wise in this world, worldly wise, that is, let him become a fool. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. Esther, I was just wondering, do you think we should stop the evening service? Oh, no, Fred. I don't get on very much. I don't know, perhaps it's me. After all, I'm not a... I mean, I'm a shop assistant, I'm not a proper preacher. I don't stand up to be. I think you speak very well. It's just that I... I say what I feel sometimes. Can't help myself. Then you must go on with it. Yes, I want to. Well, I've got to... you see, Esther, I want to help, if I can. You've helped me. - Do you really mean that? - Oh, yes. Besides, I learn things from you I never would otherwise. - Because... - Hm-hmm? Well, I can't read. Why, that's nothing. Lots of people can't read, they're none the worse for it. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Not for you, Esther. You don't have to go to books. Not your sort. What sort do you think I am? What sort do I think you are... Pure of heart. That's why I... Just a minute. Please, Esther, don't go in yet. That's why I want to ask you if you... Will you marry me? Suppose I were to tell you... ...that I have a child. What would you say then? So you see... I'm not the good woman you think I am. That's not true, is it? Yes, it's true. I have a child. He's six years old now. Well, I... So there's your answer. It was kind of you to ask me. Esther. I'm sorry. Please forgive me, Esther. You see, I... I didn't understand. Not at first I didn't. I was only thinking of... I didn't think what you must have suffered. But you mustn't go on hurting yourself. That's what you are doing, isn't it? Esther, if it means anything to you, - I still want you. - But you don't want the child. - Is that it? - I want you both. Will you say that again? Both, Esther. I don't know what to say. Except you... you are a truly good man. I can't answer now, Fred. When do you think? Tomorrow is my day for seeing Jacky. When I know, can I tell you then? Good grace, I say, this is a non-smoker. Joey John went from 7-2 to 3-1 and Craig was never more than 5-2. I was told Archer has replaced him. He's running Tillingham Fancy in Hampton Park next week. Archer is a favorite of yours. I go by results, he rides the winners. I'm talking of our side. You wait till you see what he does on Tillingham Fancy next week. I'm not keen on Archer. Wil you give me a price about that? - Alright, I'll give you a five to one. - I have a bet with you. Fine, that's... Esther! Excuse me. Esther! This is wonderful... wait! I've been looking for you everywhere. You're not getting out, Esther, please, please. I've got to talk to you. I've got to see you. Where have you been all these years? What have you been doing? Bringing up your child, that's what! Esther! Esther, please! Esther, is that you? - Yes, ma'am! - Don't forget my hot milk. No, ma'am. Esther, I swear I knew nothing about the child until I came back from abroad, honest! And now that I've found you again... Take a good look and go back where you came from! - Esther, I want to help! - Shhh! Esther. Shhh! Let me try and get you out of this. I've got a bit of money now. I don't want any of your wife's money, thank you. It's not hers. I made it myself. I finished with Peggy years ago. It was all a mistake that, I... I only gave in to her after we quarreled. Esther, I swear I knew nothing about the child until I came back. Until... ...when Mum died. I'm sorry about your mother. Yes... I wasn't much good to her, I'm afraid. Esther, tell us about the child. - What do you want to know? - Is it a boy? Yes, and a fine one. - What did you call him? - Jacky. Where is he? No matter to you where he is. He's not here anyway. Thinks his father's dead. Now, will you please go. Esther, be reasonable, listen to me, just for a minute. Things is different with me now. I can give you a home, and comfort and... ...the boy a father. Easy, isn't it? You haven't changed, William. You don't even know I'm not married. - Are you? - It's none of your business. Now will you please go away and leave me alone. Esther, I know I deserve this. But I'm not asking you to think of me, I'm asking you to think of the boy. I've done you both a great wrong and I want to repay it. That's all. Esther, Next time you go and see Jacky, take me with you? Please. After all, I am his father. Very well then. You can come. But I don't want him to know who you are. Anything you say, Esther. - Esther, will you bring up my hot milk! - Coming, ma'am. Well, take up her hot milk. And put in a dash of arsenic. Here you are, there's your ship. I'd rather have one with sails... ...like the big one in the toy shop in High Street. What's it like? It's a cutter rig, and it's got three sails. It's much bigger than any of the ones the boys sail on the Common. - What does it cost? - Ever so much. Look here. There's a golden sovereign. Give it to your mother and tell her to buy it for you. William! Jacky, give me that. I might have known. Hello, Jacky. I got some nice cakes for his tea. Mrs. Lewis, will you give him his tea in the kitchen? - Oh, Mom! - Come on, dear. So you think you can buy him back to you. How dare you try such a trick on him! Esther, I never thought, honest. - It came as natural as breathing. - You never thought. Where have I been all these years? Well, I'll tell you where I've been. The first place I was in was the Workhouse Infirmary. That's where I had Jacky, in the Workhouse. - Esther... - Then I went back into service. For sixteen pounds a year. Sometimes I couldn't even get that. And why couldn't I get it? Because I was a wicked woman on account of having your child. And where were you all those years? Travelling abroad on Peggy's money. Now that you've finished with her you think you can buy Jacky's love through me. You'd better go now, William. But please try and see neither of us again. Esther. Fred? The door's open. What's the matter, Esther? - He's come back. - What do you mean he's come back? William. Jacky's father. Jacky's father. Where did you see him? You didn't speak to him, did you? I didn't want to, Fred. I tried to get rid of him. So you did speak to him. What did he say? What does he want? He asked about the child. Said he wanted to help. - He's got a lot of money now. - Money? What's his money got to do with it? - I have this letter. - From him? I think so. Would you read it for me? You don't have to read it, Esther. Why don't you send it back to him? Please. It's written from the King's Hen, Dean Street. - Dear... He owns a public house, does he? - Yes. Dear Esther, you made it clear to me... ...that you don't want me back spoiling your life, so I'm writing. I've got a lawyer to do this out clear so it's all legal. You get two hundred now for the boy... ...and then some each year. It's a bit... It says... I'm to see Jacky, if you want to... I would like it, of course, he's a fine lad, but he owes to his mother. Forgive me, Esther, with all my love, William Latch. William Latch. This is just a lawyer's document. Fred, what am I to do? I think you know. But I want to do what's fair for Jacky. Well, that's just it. This money, where do you think it comes from? You can see how he gets it. Do you think it would be fair to the boy to touch that sort of money? You can't, Esther. Because it couldn't do any good to Jacky or anybody else. - But he's the boy's father, Fred. - Do you think he's fit to be? Oh, he's just one of the ordinary sort, no better or worse. Funny you should think that. Esther... You want to go back to him, do you? - What makes you say that, Fred? - Well, that's what it sounds like. I just want to do what's right. You can't turn back into that, you know. Come on, let's go to service. No, I won't go tonight. I must think what to do. Yes. I see. I just want to say this much. I can't give you money, if that's what you want. But I can give you a life you believe in. Not an easy life, perhaps. But an honest one. I don't want you to just give yourself to somebody, to Latch or even to me. I want you to be happy. And I know that you can't be happy without God. Oh, Fred! I'm not just another soul to save. I'm a woman too. That's why you've got to look out for omens. What about the time Brit run second to Shoemaker? Is there any omen to the busted bootlace, Ketley? - Might be. - The horse was fooled that time. Looking for somebody, miss? Is Mr. Latch in? He's not back from the course, miss. He's been at Earl's Pond. He won't be long, miss. You're a friend of his, miss? Yes... Could I wait? Certainly. - Will you take a little something? - No, thank you. John's back, he'll look after you. John! You're wanted. Oh, John! - Mr. Randal! - Esther, this is a treat! Will told me he had met you. Lucky day for him, eh? You come through to the parlor. He won't be long. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome, miss. Sit you down, Esther. Nice, like old Woodview days. Yes. Do you get any news of Mrs. Barfield? Oh, you never heard what happened then. - No. - It's a sad story. The gaffer got killed hunting. When the will was read there wasn't much in it but a lot of indifferent bloodstock. Mrs. Barfield wouldn't sell out... ...lives all alone in part of the house. Poor Mrs. Barfield. I had to go, of course. If it wasn't for William, I'd be in the workhouse. Keeps me on the run, though. Part bookie's clerk and part in the bar. If you'll excuse me. Where is she, in the parlor? Hello. William, I can't take this money. I can't. Oh, William. This is your horse, Mrs. Latch. This is the program? - Program? - She's never been to a race meeting before. You've never been to a race meet... Oh, you are going to enjoy yourself, Mrs. Latch. - Windlegummer, windle... - Oh, go away! If the governor don't hurry up changing, we shall lose our place the hill. Come on, give us the starters. - Claughton, Tamberlyn... - Talmore... - That's Lord Shaftesbury's bet. - Mr. Norman's Playground. Webub, that's the horse, that's the horse. - Not on you life it isn't? - Why, don't the omens give it? - The governor fancies Unicorn. - What, the yankee? The yankee. With Archie... - It don't make him a winner, do it? That man's a god to Will Latch. Who ever heard of a yankee winning the Derby? Here's the governor. Well, Mrs. Latch, what do you think of the uniform, eh? Governor, we'll never get our pitch. Come on, John, you don't get married every day, you know? Come on, up you go. - Hey, look out there! - Watch it! Get in front of that lot, can't you? We'll be stuck here all day! Hey, take that old hearse out of the way, can't you? You and your fish cart! I'll race you for a guinea. I'll bet you a five you don't! Alright, get your money ready! Go boy! Hold on to your heads! Come on! I'm so glad you've come. William Latch, will you mind my hat! Never mind your old hat! William! Esther! - You look good! - It's my complexion. - Doesn't she? - I must say. I do make a point of my complexion. - Come on, governor, the stand's up. - Mr. Randal! Strike me! - I'd never have known him. - Well you ain't the lily you was! Well, look here, old monkey brand! Now, you go and look after Esther for a bit... ...we'll get the business started and we'll grab a bite to eat, eh? So you two came together after all. Yes, we were married this morning. This morning? Old Esther, of all people, getting tied up on Derby Day. It was William's fancy. You know about him and his luck. So Will's a bookie, eh? Come and meet my friends. Come here. You listen to people who knows nothing about horses, never did and never will. You follow your fancy. You let your woman pick out one because she likes the color of the jockey's shirt. Alright, you want to throw your money away, don't come to me. Just shove your hand in your pockets, take out what you got and fling it away. But if you want to make some cash, if you want to make your racing pay, if you want to go home in a coach in four instead of having to walk home, then I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this information is worth a hundred guineas. Thank you very much, lady. One shilling is the price of the card. - Whatever is he doing? - Working, of course. - Why is he talking such a lot of nonsense? - Nonsense? He's pretty clever. Every horse named in this card I bet meself. I don't give you one horse and back another. Oh, alright. But where's your friend Mr. Evans? That is Mr. Evans. That's the bell, ladies and gents. You've got five minutes to bet on for the first race. A shilling's the price of a card. I guarantee, the winner of the first race. Joe, this is Esther, an old friend of mine. Charmed, I'm sure. Esther's husband makes the book. Will Latch. Will Latch? I know the name. We might do business. Allow me! Oh, get on, Esther, it's Derby Day! On the Derby, on the Derby, only on the Derby! Three to one only. Three, four five. Ten-three or four! Come on, play your forms. - - - Number 52 Talmore goes on the fifth. Thank you very much. Pedigree! Six-five against. Six-five the favorite! Pedigree? Thank you very much, sir. Number 53 Pedigree, six-five. - Remember that, sir. - William. Hello, ladies, what can I do for you, eh? Ten-one bar three or four, eh? White flag's up for the start! - - - How much have you got booked against the yankee, Grover? - Nothing to worry over, Will. - I want to lay off Pedigree. - I'm not so sure we do. - I'm plumb sure you don't. Pair in nine. - What do you know, eh? - Joe knows lots. Meet Mr. Evans, Will. - How do you do? - Nice little business you got here. I like your style. Come and see the first race, come on. You've got them upside down, you silly thing. Give them to me. Silver Nail's coming up. No, now look here. Hold them up a bit. That's it. Take it carefully. Slowly... slowly. We have the punters that time, John. Was that the Derby? No! That was the two o'clock, for the handicaps. Did you enjoy it? Go down and get yourself something to eat. - You're coming, aren't you? - I've got to go back to the stand. I've got our livings to make, Mrs. Latch. Mr. Latch's account. As I was saying, I keep it all here. I work entirely on form. I remember what each horse has done in every race and where. Of course there are some finds omens in dust coats. - Well, how's everything going? - Hello, Will, have a little glass? You know, I don't mind if I do. John Randal's a slur up there on that bookie. He's losing me customers. I'll tell you what, I'll help you out, old sport. Thank you very much. - Is he alright? - Yes, he's a friend of Sarah's. Any friend of Sarah is a friend of mine. They seem to trust your friend Joe, don't they? Will, our wedding breakfast. So it is. Sarah, you take Esther on the fair ground, will you, till the race starts. Alright? Come on, Esther. I bet it'll be good to have a nice little chat. You see, Esther, before you came to Woodview... ...I thought it was Will and me. When you come, it was Will and you. I soon saw how it was and kept quiet. So you owe me something in a way. You could persuade Will to take Joe on as his clerk. Oh, go on, Esther! I do believe... Hurry up or we'll miss the silly old Derby! But Sarah! I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Well, less perhaps. I came with William. Oh, yes, of course. Your... your husband, he's a bookmaker, isn't he? I forgot. How about the boy? Jacky? - He's here, is he? - No, he's at home. I see. You know... I didn't mean it to turn out that way for you, somehow... I know it's... I know it's... I'm glad you're going on with the meetings, Fred. Oh, yes... What about you, Esther? Everything alright? - Happy? - Yes, I'm happy. Good. Good, that's what I always wanted for you. Thank you, Fred. Goodbye. Esther! Do not forget. Good evening, Rosie. - Good evening, sir. - Have a good day? - Yes, best ever. Put those in the safe for me, will you? Take that. Bar did well too. - Was Jacky any trouble? - Not at all, ma'am. He's sound asleep. Welcome to Latch Manor. Your first Derby. And all you see of the race is Fred Parsons. Oh, Will, that man Evans, you're not taking him on as your clerk. John Randal is a bit past it. I think he'll be happier in the bar. But Will, do you think that's right? You stick to things you know about, Mrs. Latch. Bringing up children. Come on. Let me pick you up... There. We had a good day today. I'm always lucky in the Derby. A few more of these and we'll be able to send him to a good school. Out of all this. Come on. I never thought to see Esther make a home in a public house, sure as my name is John Randal. But whatever she thought, she never said a word. Took to it all a wonder. That's a large. Want some? She soon picked up the running of the bars... after all, she couldn't read. And soon William left the King's Head to her... ...and spent more and more time on the course. Mind you, I don't think that inside herself... ...Esther ever really got over the idea of William being a bookmaker. And I can't say I was much struck on Joe Evans acting clerk. and me being shut up in the jug and bottle. Still, the first three years passed happily enough. Business didn't do so bad either, but nothing special. Bad luck happens on the turf often enough. But luck started to run all one way and keep running. For a whole season the bookies could do nothing right. William had always been pretty crafty with the risks he took. But now he made one mistake after another. Worse than that. You know, bookmaking is a strong man's game. Out in all weathers, always using your voice, trudging all over the country. One wretched afternoon in the winter of 1884... We'd better run for it, mate, if we play out we're broke! Not with Latch luck! Terrible day, have you. Yes, the omens is a bit off the marker I bet. Oh, just one of them unfortunate accidents. Surely them gifted with omens aren't troubled with accidents. Say what you like. There's more things in heaven and earth than in your greasy pocketbook. I bet two pints it ain't any greasier than any other in this bar. What's grease got to do with it? You can make jokes, but the facts speak for themselves. There's times when the mind is fresh like the morning. That's the time for them with the gift to read knowings. It's a sudden light that comes into the mind. And it points straight as a dart. And there ain't nothing to stop it. I'll give you an instance. I remember a conversation I had with a chap about American corn... ...to help the British farming. That conversation came back to me later... ...as clear as if the dawn had begun to break. I thought it was an omen about somewhere. And all of a jumble, I took up the evening paper... There was my horse, Wheatier. And you backed it? No. And you know why? At that very moment a cab turned over in the street and I ran out to help. There was another horse called Bright Neck. And of course I backed him. He claims he lives here. Walter! Will! Rotten day for the bookies, luv. Where's Joe? Joe? We parted. If you want to know why, go and find him. And don't come back. That's Fred Archer, doctor. - By Spye. - Excellent likeness. The greatest man ever to ride. He'll always carry my money. Latch, you must cut down on excitement. Understand me? - Yes. - Good. Then I'll make arrangements on the way home. I'll be back later, Mrs. Latch. Tell old John downstairs to give you a nip before you go. Oh, I thank you all the same. Drink it up. - Oh, it's not my teapot. - Well, it's going to be. Not just now. What did he say? Oh... just some nonsense about lungs. I've got to go into Brompton Hospital. For long? I don't know. Maybe the winter. It's just as well, with Jacky about. You'd better get up now that I might tidy the bed. I can manage. I have to give up the course. That ought to please you. - Yes... But I'm sorry for you, William. - Oh, that's alright. I've got everything worked out. If I can't get to see my customers, they'll have to come and see me. But Will! You're not going to take bets in the bar. - Why not? - It's against the law. Against the law, who cares? Don't take anything from strangers, that's all. Well, Esther, how else can we live with? We're pretty near broke. - We've got the house. - The house. We only rent that. Besides, what's it worth without the custom we get from the racing folk? Well, we could sell the goodwill. We are the goodwill, you and me. People come here because... because they like us. Esther... Another thing I didn't tell you. I've got to get out of England by the winter. - Where? - Egypt, the doctor says. Egypt? You'll like that. You've never been abroad and... ...there's a racecourse in Alexandria. So you see, we've got to get together quite a bit of money. Will, I have something to say to you. What is it? Will, the time's long past when you could persuade me... ...of what's right or wrong by talking. I'll have no bookmaking in this house while I'm in charge of it. - Well, where is the money to come from? - We'll have to take a chance. I know these places where they make a book in the bar. They're the cause of all the trouble in the neighborhood. The men let everything go as long as they have money for the horses. Well, I'll not keep a house where these men come... ...with the money their wives need. To gamble on horses they never see... ...and drink away the little they win. Look at this place even. Look at the useless sort of people that come here. No, you can't talk me out of what I've seen and what I know. You see, Will, I've... I've grown up since we were married... ...and there's no going back. When you get out of the hospital we'll find some way of earning a living. Come along now, get back into bed. This is a strange time to talk of what you've done. Is that loving a man? There's no love in letting a man ruin himself. Esth... Esther, there's... there's another side to what you've said. My side. People who come here haven't got very much to look forward to. Low wages, hard grind. All they get out of life is the yearn of bet. What's the difference between laying a bet here and... ...down in the course? What about the stock exchange? Isn't that gambling? It's the same old story, one all for the rich and another for the poor. But you'll never stop betting, backing offenses, human nature. And it'll go on till the end of time. You've sent Jacky away, haven't you? He got a chance in a training ship. It wasn't much good for him here. I see. - Mind you're not to excite him. - Oh, no, Sister. - Hello, Will. - Hello, mates. - You got the Derby call-over? - Now Mr. Latch! Blast, Sister. You asked for a winner yourself last night. Oh, you're incorrigible. Well, I'll take these. Made a couple of pounds on the National. - How are you feeling, Will? - Fine, fine. Now what about the Derby? French horse aside, there are only two in it. - Aye, Paradox and Melton. - Paradox has it on form. - And Archer chose Melton. - That's the problem in a nutshell, Will. But Archer didn't chose Melton, he... He was retained by the stable, they claimed him. Well, what's the difference? Now look here, you two, I've had nothing else to do here but think. Now, I've thought this race out. Now, Archer could ride Paradox if they let him. But they put Webub instead, see? Now, Webb's the best of the lot by Archer and... ...even Archer can't beat the form book. You always said he could, Will. I'm serious, John, dead serious. Paradox is at sixes. The other horse is at twos. Why? Well, hero worship. All the big money is following Archer. But you've got to consider form, isn't that right, Walter? All they say about jockeys is one thing but... Well, there's too much at stake in this for me. I've got to get sixes for my hundreds or I... I don't get to Egypt. And if I'm in this country by next winter, well... Will six hundred get you to Egypt, Will? Yes. With a bit left over for Esther and the kid. That's how it is, see? It's lucky I'm... lucky. You can't do it, Will. Have I ever lost at Epsom with you? Spread it about a bit, Will, for heaven's sake. What's the use? What I pick up here I shall lose there. I've got to get a lump of money. It's all or nothing. But I wish the Tin Man was up. Time's up, please. Er, Sister, you run along with Walter and he'll fix you up with a nice little horse for Epsom. I just want another word with John here. Only one then. Goodbye, Will. Goodbye, nice to have seen you. Sit down. - How's Esther? - Fine. She was put out you wanted to see us today, and not her. Was she? - How's Jacky? - Doing well. He'll be at sea soon. Will he? Really? What other news? Don't ask me to do this, Will? Don't. What about Esther? John, don't you see? It's because of Esther I'm doing it. A dead husband's no use to her, is he? Or to the kid. This is my last chance. It's my only chance. Listen, John, Go to the Derby. Take Esther with you. She always brought me luck. Then take that hundred pounds I saved. Put it on Paradox... for a win. Then... come back here in the evening... and tell me you're sorry you ever doubted my luck. I'd better put the money on now, Esther. I'll wait for you. I can't do it with you watching. You go on, dear. I'll meet you at the start. Alright. Let your woman pick out one because she likes the color of the jockey's shirt. Alright, you want to throw your money away, don't come to me. Just shove your hand in your pocket, take out what you got and fling it away. If you want to make some cash, if you want to make your racing pay, If you want to go home in a coach of four instead of having to walk home, then I tell you, la... I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this information is worth a hundred guineas. A shilling is the price of the card. One shilling only and I'll guarantee the winner of the Derby. Is this what you wanted? Nice and private. Thank you, Sister. Just while the race is on. The others won't think I'm... pegging out, will they? Oh, don't, rubbish. And you mustn't worry about the silly horses. Does it really matter which one wins? Just a bit. Stay with me for a bit, will you? Well, just a wee while, if you promise to keep quiet. Yes. - Have you ever been to the Derby? - No. What time is it? Just after a quarter to three. They'll be in the paddock now. Waiting for the mounting bell. Can you hear the crowds? The last bets. Only six-one bar one. Ten-one bar three or four. Shhh, Mr. Latch. John! I put the money on. I got sixes. Now then, jockeys, a nice clean start right on time. Hm, the starter is Mr. McGeorge. He won't stand any nonsense. Straight line now, please. Barrats, keep that French horse back, will you? Back, Archer. Come up into line, Webb. Thank you. That's Paradox. A strong-looking bay. Our horse. He looks fit enough. - Who's riding him, John? - Fred Webb. Remember. Crimsom, black and white sleeves. Nice straight line now, please. Barrats, keep that French horse back, will you! Back, Archer. Up into line, Webb. Nice clean start. Old Webb's trying to size up Archer. That must be Archer. Hold it now, Archer. Yes, that's the enemy. Melton, Lord Hasting's colt. It's a pity you can't watch from our old stand on the hill. There's somebody else there now, I suppose. I'm sure it'll be there again... next year. What's the time now? Nearly three. They'll be coming into line now. It's a small thing this year. The starter shouldn't have very much trouble. Right! Move up! False start! Stay! - What is it? - False start. Now look here, you jockeys. I'm not going to have any of that nonsense at this meeting. Nor any disobedience of orders. No hanky-panky or monkey tricks. You'll go when I start you, and you'll come back when I call you! Or I'll report you to the stewards. Now then. Once again. Move up! This is going to be it, Esther. Come on! Going to the finish! They're at the mile. Who's in front? I can't see. Well done, Webb. If only Archie doesn't... Jacky... Jacky... Now, Mr. Latch. I must tell him. He must... not... live... the way I... Not... - Jacky. - Lie down, sir. Tea already? He's here, ma'am. Could he come in? Here? Who is? Oh, yes, yes, of course. Jacky. - Here he is, ma'am. - Good afternoon, ma'am. Come in, Jacky, and sit down. Over here, next to me. - And so you like the sea. - Yes, ma'am. - And you've been all the way to India. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, I brought you something back from the bazaar, ma'am. Oh, how very kind of you to think of me. Oh, yes! It's very pretty. But I'm afraid it's rather big for me. Oh, come on, ma'am, you don't wear it around your wrist, you wear it around your ankle. I like this young man, Esther. You must be very proud of him. Oh, I am... very proud of him. Very proud indeed.
