Hey, Aishe. Where's my beautiful bride? Tell her I want my dance. Come on, Nikola! Whoo whoo. What are you doing? Aishe. Aishe! Tamas? Hana? Aishe... Don't touch me, Tamas. No... This is your fault, Hana. Hana, I curse your family to die... Hana, I curse your family to die... by the hand of your... Hana, she's dying. What have you done? I heard her. Was Aishe casting the Abolishment Curse? Did she say the final words? - Did Aishe finish it? - No, I don't know. Well, she will when her spirit leaves her body and rises. Naida, she's dead. What are you doing? We have to sever the hand that killed her. Naida, what? The hand that takes the life holds the life. You know this. If we bury your hand with her body we'll hold her spirit down forever. You don't know it'll work. For the sake of my unborn child you'd better hope it does. Not my hand, Naida. Please. - It's the only way. - No... Your hand can never be removed, ever. Or her spirit will rise and she will finish the curse. I know. Promise me you won't let anybody, I mean, anybody on our land. We can't risk anyone finding the grave. Promise me, Hana. I promise. May this new generation light the way for our people! - For loyalty. - For loyalty. Oh, shoot... Nikola, will you help? Thank you. I'll never wear one of these. The day the man has to wear one, I might reconsider. - Beautiful. - Come. That's so sweet. Aw... I'm so proud. Drink up. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Really, aunt Hana, we're not in the old country anymore. Why is it that only women have to wear big old sold signs once they get married? Would you try to look for the beauty in our traditions, not the fault. I couldn't agree with you more, Mom. Well, if they're so great, how come you never wear yours? - Dani. - Ha, ha... Hi, I'm Petar's cousin. - Pleased to meet you. - Hey... If we knew the way to get invited back to this old place was to marry your sorry ass, well... I'd do that. Jeez, Matej. Okay, and now go get some coffee. Go. Yeah, that's my brother. But he's right, we would have settled even for a funeral. Mm. Still charming as ever, I see. Your funeral may be the only time we do get invited back, since you probably won't get married, right? Ah... Mom! Uh... Spitting... is a way of ensuring good luck or success for our people. Yeah, she just wants to make sure you're going to be a good wife to my cousin here. Having second thoughts? If I knew what I was getting into I wouldn't have proposed. What? Way to wear the pants, girl. So, she proposed to you? I like your dress. You can lose the coin. The wedding is over. They're leaving tonight. Okay, Naida? Think the rumors are true? Where there's odor, there's a pile of... Jelka! Watch it! Must be a reason they hid themselves all these years. Why come out now, then? And now the son marries an American! This place has some bad energy. Yeah, it's bad. Hey. I know we're still on everyone's lips, but that doesn't mean that they know what's going on. Naida... Music's the one thing that has always been able to connect us to the rest of the world. Come on, Nikola. Whoo! Where is Zara's father? He left before Zara was born. Looks like your aunt Naida never got over it. No. Her and mom probably just got into another fight. Seriously, I've never seen two sisters always so at odds. You sure don't want any visitors do you? You know what that is? No, no, I mean... Those thorns could intimidate... the toughest of criminals. It's um... It's called firethorn. Something that's protected my family for centuries. After a sacrifice is offered, we're the only ones who can pass through unharmed. You know... if you get tangled in it... you can't get out. Those thorns... lock themselves into place. They say the pain... is excruciating. So, why don't you dig them up then? Our people are superstitious about shovels. We believe working with them will eventually lead to death. Speaking of... You sure you want this for your life? Of course, I want to. Yeah, you say that now, but if you would know... Just how happy we were by becoming part of our family, right? Yay, family. - Okay, let's go, sweetheart. - Yeah. Okay? Family. Woohoo! I'm so sorry. Hana, do mama i tata know that their grandson was getting married? There's no occasion in the world that can take away the pain and the shame I brought them. That must be why Nikola doesn't have any pictures of his family. - Don't! - Because why be reminded... every day... of what you can't go back to. In a world that's already ostracized us all, and now his own family. Naida. He's even denied children of his own, because he's too frightened that your curse... What do you want from me? After all that Nikola sacrificed, and yet you still allowed this ridiculous wedding to take place here. We all made sacrifices. Why did you even come? Because you made me a promise. That you'd never let any family, anybody, onto this land. - I know my promise. - And then you broke it... And now, once again because of your selfishness I have to stay here and protect us all. My son has never asked for anything... but this. It would break my heart if he couldn't get proper blessings from the family. We are still paying for the last time you let your heart cloud your mind. I'm so sorry, mom and dad. Steer everyone away from Aishe's grave. Steer everyone away from Aishe's grave. Steer everyone away from Aishe's grave. Steer everyone away from Aishe's grave. Purify bad intentions of all who enter. How about a drink? Hmm. Okay. Do you? Where are you going? Stay with us. Yeah? What? My wife needs me. Petar. I am family, let me pass. It's moving on its own, Petar. I am so sorry, baby. I'm going to get my mom, okay? Stay here, okay? I am family, let me pass. Why would you go in there? Mom! I, I didn't. I just... I just, I got too close to the edge. Oh. The herbs will help with the pain, okay? Thank you.. Okay? I'll hold you, okay. You need to lie down, okay? I'll take you inside. Just... careful. Stop. I'll put some herbs under her bed, Naida. Petar! Get out here and sing something with Dani. Water from our land to purify. Roots from our land to heal. Shells to strengthen and protect. Whoo! I came to see how you're feeling. I'm, I'm feeling a little better. I gotta go check on my bride. I'll let you rest up so you can get going on your honeymoon. To keep in memory. During your darkest of times, this memory can act as your light. Hey. I remember that day so clearly. How is it even possible? What was I, like four? You were three. It is so good to have you back. How's your thesis going? It's going. It's just, um... It's taken me a while to find my place in the world, Mom. You know I home schooled you to protect you. - Mom, people were saying about... - Mindless gossip. But you and aunt Naida perpetuate it by using your gifts so openly. We came to this country so we didn't have to hide. But we have. But it's more than that though, right? - My isolation... - Is Sunny up? No. Not yet. We're going to crash here and take off in the morning. Thank you... for an amazing day. I love you, Mom. I love you too. Good night. I pushed too hard to have the wedding here, didn't I? No, no, no... I'm glad we did. Just as long as you don't hold all the... spitting and... loud talking and... monster plants against me. Stop, you're great. I'd kill to have a family. Well, you do now. Mm-hm. How are you feeling? Still a bit funky. But... I'm sure if you do that thing... Oh. Well, say no more. So... what happened to your Mom's hand? You really want to talk about my mom's missing hand right now? I mean, it's not like she has a lisp. She lost it in a car accident when my birth father died. Oh. I'm sorry, I'm such a jerk. Yeah, you are. Hana! Gosh! Jeez, Matej. I need to go home. Yeah, no shit. Come on. It's okay. Ooh! Are you okay? Matej passed out on our couch. He can't spend the night here. Can you please take him home?. I will as soon as I'm done. The bride's side was especially empty today, huh? On both sides were. Didn't Petar say her parents died when she was young and she has no other family? Yeah, but to not even have a single friend show up? Well, maybe it was all... too last minute. What is found downstream came from upstream. Okay, so what's the problem now? Well, nothing, just don't you find any of it strange? No. We know nothing about her. I'm beginning to appreciate why our people arrange marriages. Well, ours was arranged. Even though I don't know you any better. I have grown... to truly... love you. I love you too. You were my best friend! Forgive me. You were my best friend. You were my best friend. I am family, let me pass. My blood will cloak where you lay. My blood will cloak where you lay. My blood will cloak where you lay. My blood will cloak where you lay. A resurrection. Hana, I curse your family to die... Hana, I curse your family to die... ...by the hand of your... Matej. Matej. What? You'd better not have taken my car, Dani. What the hell's that? Hmm. Sunny? Sunny? Your face, I... What are you doing out here? I um... I, I don't, I don't know. I just, um... I woke up outside and um... Um... It's, it's freezing. Come on. Petar, come on. Come on. Let's get you warm. Oh, damnit, Matej. I can't believe you drove. Oh, shit. Oh. Mom, I need a huge cup of joe. Good morning, sweetheart. - Oh, you've made kukuruza. - Mm-hm. Mmm, very nice. - Hot! - Hm. And sarma. - Very nice. - Hey! What? Mmm. I can't wait for Sunny to try this. I made an extra one for you to take on the road. Ah, there it is. For your health. We're actually going to stick around just a day or two. Sunny's still not feeling 100%. I'm a little worried about her leg. Oh, the sarma. Hey, Mom. Do you... remember me sleepwalking as a kid? Sleepwalking? No. Because I... I woke up outside last night and... - It was... - ...the trash. What is this troublemaker doing here? No, seriously, why are you still here? Putting off the honeymoon because you're scared you won't know what to do? Sunny's still not feeling good. Smartass. You know what, maybe I should split before you all scare her off like you did my other girlfriends. It wasn't my fault you couldn't keep one. What the hell, it was, and remember Jennifer Lefton. I cannot believe you're still bringing that up. It started all the rumors about our family. Oh, please the rumors were around way before then. You mean before you used your talents to set those kids' pant legs on fire in front of the library? Huh? They were making fun of you in front of Jennifer. I was defending your honor. Yeah, well, she never spoke to me again. So, thank you very much for that. Well, at least the boys left you alone. And so did everyone else in this town. I'm just glad Sunny didn't meet you before... the wedding. - No fair. - No fair. Oh, hey. Sit down. I'm sorry about your leg. Is it better? Yeah, it should be good as new in the next few days. Ah... Are you going to wear that to work? Yep. What kind of work do you do? Oh. Let me show you. Zara, knock it off. What's the big deal? She's family. No secrets allowed. Yeah, it's okay. Zara comes from a long line of gifted women. She's known as one of the intuitives. - Fortune tellers. - Hey. Don't listen to him. It's a well-respected gift. Ma, ma, maybe we should do this a little bit later. What? Uh, why don't you go check on Sunny? Go on. Were you able to pick up anything? Only that she's pregnant? She's preg... What? Oh, God. That'll just complicate our bindings. What else did you see? I don't know. It was... all jumbled. I needed more time. She's still limping. Mom said that you put healing trava under her bed. I did. I did put healing trava under her bed. She should have been completely better by this morning. Mm. I cannot get enough of this. Listen... You're just overthinking this. We're not used to having so many people around. Maybe. Thanks again for helping with the wedding stuff. I appreciate it. Oh, crap, I gotta go. What's the rush? What? I'm meeting someone for lunch. A local boy? When was the last time one of our own asked me out? I'll tell you when. Never. Fine. Tell me about your date. His name is Dale DeLois Smith. I don't care about his name. All right, you know Arnold's? The hair salon over on Pacific? - Yes. - His mom runs that. - Okay. - Is that enough for you now? - Yes. - Okay. - I love you. Thank you. - I love you too. I want answers, not games. Yeah? Who were you talking to? No one. I'm sorry about Zara. She's... It's fine. We're forever, you and I. You've stolen my heart. Okay. We really have to go somewhere else. Let's go in the house then. This place is legend. Oh, no. I mean, we gotta go... Wait... What did you say? Witch, old witch Do you live in a house Or do you live in a haystack With the red-eyed crows? Come on, who can say they've done it in the bloody witch house? Go home. I don't think so, beautiful. I said go home. Ah! Ah! Stop it, you crazy bitch. Argh! Go! Now, before you say anything, I know that I broke the rules. I shouldn't have brought him here. He was just another asshole looking for a haunted tour. Our people are in good practice of recognizing insincerity. Usually. Why don't they just leave us alone? Coming to the States didn't change what we hoped. Others still project their... Their repressed reverie onto us. I know. Has everyone gone? No. Mom, you can't just chase them out. Something needs to be done. I received a warning. It's because they're here. I know it. Listen, you need to do something for me. You need to go back to the shop and wait for me there, and do not leave until I say so. No, please, please, please, just go. I am family, let me pass. My hand! The curse... It's been released. Naida! You just sealed our fate. We don't know that she finished the curse. We didn't hear the final words. You're on your own now. What? No, Naida. Naida, get back here. We can figure this out. Can I come in? Hey, come on in. Come on in. I was just about to take a break. So, how's outside world treating you, my son? World's fine. It's just... Our people's place in it. It's ambivalent, you know. Yeah, most of our people feel the same. How will anyone ever take my work seriously when even my own professors believe our people don't even know what a radio is. The written word will be our sword. You'll see. You... mind if I take your drink? Sure. So, what you're working on these days? It's a more a... personal project. It's an heirloom of sorts... for you and Zara. When we're gone, you know. The... story of our family. Oh? I didn't know we were such an interesting bunch. You'd be surprised. We... We used to be part of a larger family. What happened? Well, an awful event. So wait, you're... You're saying the rumors are true then? That we had something to do with that missing couple. Don't listen to the rumors. They are like odors. The more pungent they are, the easier they spread. That's all. Every family does have some... some buried secrets. Ours is no exception. Do... some of those secrets include my birth father by any chance? I see. I know you're here. Why don't you just show yourself? Petar! Hana! Is everything okay? Fine. I was in my garden. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Matej. He never came home. Nikola gave him a lift last night. I checked with everyone. I'm sorry, I don't have time for this right now. Then let me talk to Nikola. He can at least tell me where he dropped him off. Hana! What the hell! Nikola, I want to apologize. "This curse is extremely powerful and is forbidden to cast. Its purpose is solely to exterminate an enemy's beloved bloodline." Exterminating a bloodline. "In all my research, it appears the only one who can end it is the one who began it." Now... Petar. I was um... I was just looking for Nikola. Okay. Unseen come forth. You can't hide a cat in a sack, its claws will reveal them. I can't help it that I fell in love with him. Reveal the secret of the one who owns this scarf. Reveal the secret of the one who owns this scarf. Reveal the secret of the one who owns this scarf. May the secret of the one who owns this scarf be revealed. Are you certain you've found Aishe's life blood I've told you this many times already, child. But I just don't understand, tante Galina. Why can't you call upon her spirit? When I've tried... I have been met with only images of the friends who betrayed her... or firethorn... The blood veil they have created, hiding the location of her body from my sight. Such a spell would require the painful bloodletting sacrifice. They are unrelenting... and quite powerful. But we are all powerful and gifted people. Why, why can't I go after her now? You can't. I told you. They are watching. They are on guard. This is only work if you move like a thief in the night... Alison. Patience. Yes, your name is not Leila anymore. It's Alison Robertson. Very American. Pay close attention. Remember this name. He will be the one to give you the words that will help you pass through the firethorn, which hides Aishe's body, so you can release her spirit and she can go rest with her ancestors. Look for the heaviest covering and you will find her. Remember... Remember. Heal me. Heal me. Heal me. Heal me. Heal me. Your eyes! Aishe's been freed. It was Sunny. She's Aishe's sister. - I needed more time. - No! No, no, we're not giving up, Nikola. You know as well as I do, there's nothing that can nullify this curse. There's one thing we can try. Now, you said the only way the curse could be stopped is if the person who cast it calls it back, right? What if I bind my spirit with Aishe's? With our spirits intertwined, maybe I would be able to call it back. I will not let you risk eternal damnation of your soul based on my hunch! We have no other options. Well, that's not one! Let's at least try and reach out to the ancestors. And do what? And do what? Evoke their help for a crime we've kept hidden? One they deem unforgivable. Don't you see? We are exactly where we are because they want us to be here. Swear to me, you won't try it. Swear it. You have to go and tell Petar everything. He needs to know what's happening. You knew one day you would have to tell him the truth about his father. - Petar. - Have you lied to me about him, this whole time? There's more to it than that. Start talking! Now! Look... This is charged, okay? And it'll help ward off the evil that's around her. Take it. Sunny? Matej! Nikola! A bat. Prediction of death. That's it? Okay. I'm definitely losing it. Do not ignore me. Just tell me what you want me to do. Please! Aishe! If I could take back what happened, I swear to you on everything that's dear to me... Damn you! Just take me! - Hana! - It's fine. What, was it Aishe? Are you absolutely certain? She said the final words to the curse? Without a doubt. I need... You should just go. You're not part of the bloodline. - The curse won't follow you. - I'm not going anywhere. I just can't believe there's nothing we can do. Wait a minute. Not us. Her sister. Aishe wasn't expecting Sunny to get wrapped up in all of this. Sunny's pregnant. Then she's carrying your lineage inside her. Yes, Sunny can plead for the curse to be reversed because it will affect her and her child. Go get Naida and Zara. We need them. I love you. A storm's coming. I'm pregnant. That's... That's a bit too tight. Petar... Petar. Sunny, What the hell? Didn't you hear me? God, you're bleeding. Oh, my God. Here, come inside. I'll go take care of this in the room. You just, you go wash up. What the hell! Why isn't this coming off? It'll never come off. What happened? You had something to do with her death, didn't you? Yes. It was my greatest mistake. Nikola's notes. They mentioned a horrible curse put on our family. She's the one that placed it on us? It's the Abolishment Curse. It's meant to kill off our branch of the family tree. You let me bring Sunny into this? No. She's the one who released it, but now, now she's the only one that can help us. Help us? Don't you dare drag her into any of this shit. She already is. I gotta get her out of here. No, no, no... You okay? Yeah. - Son... - I'm not your son. Let him go. When this is all over... you and I will leave this place together. We'll start over again. Never look back. Go get Naida and Zara. I need to go find Sunny, okay? Oh, God, no. It's not mine. It's not my blood. Tante Galina said nothing about your curse. If I would have known I never would've come here. I only wanted to set you free. You have to convince Aishe to end it, for your unborn child's sake before the bloodshed starts. It's begun. There was so much blood on my hands. Oh, my God, it's you. That's, that's not possible. Aishe should have known that when you place a curse it comes back to her threefold. Your sister's spirit is damned. And now, so are you. I will not let you damn my son. Where the hell are you, Mom? It's me. I am family, let me pass. I will put you back in this pit of hell where you belong. No! No! Zara! No! Zara! No! Oh, my God. Zara! Zara! Zara! No! No. Where have you been? I, um... I... I thought I'd get a head start and... pack some bags into the car. You know, I... I'd never mean to have hurt you, Petar. Right? I'm not following, Sunny. No! Hana, help me. Aishe! Aishe, stop this curse, now! Please! To keep in memory. Remember our moment. During your darkest of times this memory can act as your light. Mom? Sunny... What the hell is happening? Listen to me. We have very little time. No! No! Hana, I curse your family to die by the hand of your... your son! Mom... - Have I...? - No. No, honey. I made a vow. I betrayed my best friend with her husband... Your father. So any blood, honey, is on my hands. It's not on yours. Okay? Stop this! No! Run! Run! You said that the only way the curse could be called back is if the person who cast it calls it back. What if I bind my spirit with Aishe's? Swear to me you won't try. Aishe, I bind your spirit. I bind your spirit. - What are you doing? - Hurry. Get in. I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. Aishe, I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. I bind your spirit to mine forever. - No. - No, Petar, please. Aishe! I release Petar from this curse!
