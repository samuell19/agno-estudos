Beethoven. Schumann. Beethoven. MOM, BUY ME TOOTHPASTE AND SOAP, PLEASE. THANK YOU. 100. Monday, white. Wednesday, dark. Wednesday, dark. Monday, white. Monday, white. Whites for Monday. Thanks, Abang. - White, Monday, white... - Okay. Hello, Abang. Wait a minute. Monday's color is white, right? Okay. - Monday, white... - Yes, Abang. I am so late. Thank you, Abang. Bye, Abang. What is intuition? It's the way the universe speaks to us. Unfortunately, we never understand it. When, in fact, we can have a dialogue with the universe. What's wrong? This is the first time I screwed up in years. Do you think it's a sign? Yes. It's a sign for us to bake a new one. Let me do that while you get ready. No, there's no time. - Let me take those instead. - Okay. Don't forget to take one for Abang's mom. I've put it on the table. Yes, Mom. I'll be on my way now. Senja. - The usual, right? - Yes. - Where's your boyfriend? - In hell, for all I care. Your friend, Reggy, sang here last night. It was my birthday, and he sang Happy Birthday to me. - Really? - Yes, Reggy is such a nice guy. Yesterday was your birthday? Happy birthday. How old are you? - 25. - 25? That's awesome. Hey! Look who finally made it. - Please, not too much. - Come on! Fill it all the way up. You don't know how important today is for me. Fill it up. Yes! Are you feeling better? Yes, I took some medicine and slept all day yesterday. You know what? Today... Excuse me. Tonight, I am reborn. So why now? I've been an idiot too long. I have no more tears for him. Five years! I was holding on. Enough. Are you sure? Reggy! Reggy! I broke up with him. You know how hard I've been trying, right? I did everything for him. But he's been seeing that girl. The one I told you about. I knew from the start something was going on. I caught him on a date with her. Why didn't you say anything? Oh, God... I don't know what to do. I've had enough. I bet it's him. Why are you calling me now? I know who you went out with. Do you think I'm an idiot? Yes, but you... I know that. But you still hurt me. You hurt me, baby. I'm all by myself. Bye. But that old me is no more. Come on. Aren't you going to get that? There's no need. He's just panicking. I didn't return his calls. I didn't text back. So here he is, calling me like a crazy person. I can't even use my phone now. What if it's an emergency? What if he got into an accident? What if he's in the hospital? Dying? Yes, Brother. Irwan. But, Brother... Okay. What are you celebrating? Nothing. Nothing to celebrate. I'm Saras. That is, if you want to know. I'm... Andre. Andre. Andre. You know, if... a person is celebrating something, that person has to do something. Do what? Maybe... something he hasn't done before. Or... something he's been dying to do. You wouldn't be able to afford me. Why a house gecko? It's cute. A tattoo is permanent. You can't have it just because it's cute. It's cute. They say, the virtual world is different from the real world. But, since I joined this mailing list a year ago, I have come to feel that they're somewhat similar in nature. One member has impressed me with his way of thinking, his writing and his point of view about the world. I feel at ease, even though I'm still just a mere spectator. Al! Poor Tano! BUNDA GUEST HOUSE Abang, I'm going to the market. I have your list with me. Abang. One. Missing one. What are you looking for? Missing one. Abang! Missing one. Abang, look for it slowly please. Look slowly, Abang! Abang? Abang. Abang, you might have misplaced it. - It must be somewhere. - Missing one! Maybe you forgot... Abang! How could you do that? Put it back! Abang! Abang! Abang! Abang! Abang! Abang! Abang! Abang! - Finished yet? - Yes. - Hey! Hey! - Missing one. Are you trying to steal? Abang! Abang! Look at me! It's me. Leia. What do you want? - Missing one. - Soap. I'll pay for it. This is my landlady's son. - I thought he was crazy. - He's not. This is your soap, Abang. Yes, it's your soap. How much? Rp 2,500 for the soap. Rp 8,000 for the keys. Thank you. One extra. One extra. One extra. Ab... One extra. Abang. Keep it. If you lose one, you'll have a spare one. Okay? Keep it. All right. It's big, right? Okay. Anyone wants to share their feelings this week? Maybe Senja? No? It's okay. You're off the hook because you brought us cake today. How about the others? Me. Sometimes I don't understand my intuition. A few days ago, I had a really bad feeling. Like someone in my family is going to be sick or in trouble. But I don't know who or what is wrong. It's so strange. Why is that? Well, basically, human beings are part of the universe. So, when we were born, we were equipped with the same language as the universe. That's natural. Okay? Unfortunately, when we grow up, we are taught how to use a language that humans invented. We forget about the universe's language. Although the universe has given us millions of signs, we have become too arrogant to understand them. We'll continue next week. - It's getting late. - Okay. - Thank you. - Anytime. See you next week. You've been in this club for almost a year now, but you've never shared your stories. Why force ourselves to speak if listening is enough? Feel free to ask if you have any questions. I'm not a psychic. But even the most dim-witted can read your face. Did you enjoy the cake I made? I like it very much. I prepared a special one just for you... to take home. I don't know why, but I screwed it up. I'll make you another one tomorrow. That would be great. Even more so if you'll let me help you make it. Let me. It's okay. Just go home. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's a normal question. Sometimes I don't understand my intuition. It's okay. It's a normal question. We've forgotten the universe's language. What's wrong, Senja? What's wrong, my dear? What's wrong? I don't want to go on like this. I'm scared. Calm down, my dear. I've never asked for these visions. Andre? Andre! Hi! Hi! I'm meeting a friend in a minute. Can I sit here and wait with you? It's bitter. Do you like coffee this bitter? Bitterness reminds us that... there are sweet things out there. - Really? - Yeah. And what does sweetness remind us of? Nothing. Just the fact that too much sugar is bad for your waistline. I see. Okay. In that case, I'll take the bitter one. Do you like it? Let me order something else for you. Excuse me! Andre? I've fallen in love... with someone whose eye color I don't even know. Maybe green. Maybe hazel. I've read a book on the law of attraction. So I was saying... What were you saying? The universe... is all connected. A full, uninterrupted circle. Like this. What's this gibberish, dude? Synchronicity, man. The universe... is not a straight line. It's one, perfect circle. It's expanding. It's growing. And everything in it is connected. So it's nonsense, bullshit if someone tells you it's a coincidence. Nothing like that. That's what you call synchronicity. Well, that's what synchronized means. Everywhere it's connected, man. Lorenz said, a flutter of a butterfly's wings in Hong Kong... can lead to a storm in New York. Edward Lorenz. The chaos theory? The butterfly effect? Okay. Do you even know what I'm talking about? What was I talking about? You're in New York! This stuff is dope, man! - Guys, Al's here. - Come join us! - Come on, Al. - I'm fine here. - Just for a minute. - Come on. Join us here. - The table is all set for you. - Thank you. Okay? My mom asked about you. Really? That's so sweet. What's up? She said you always have weird boyfriends. What do you mean weird? Remember that student body president? Hi, Auntie. How are you? 250 copies of this one... and 250 copies of that one. Both 250? STOP EVIL CAPITALISM SUPPORT PEOPLE, USE CHALK ANTI NEO-LIBERALISM EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM Are you protesting against board markers? It's not that simple. You can't just look at the surface. You have to understand the philosophy. Chalk is produced by small businesses. It's pro-people. Board markers represent hedonism. The evil of capitalism, man! Okay. So, what do you think of him? - When is your protest? - Two days from now. Two days from now? - Can I come? - You want to? Yes, can I? Of course. For real? Cool. And he ended up a dropout. But he was the president, and he was so cool back then. The one and only in the college. - Oh, my God. - What about that rock band dude? But he was the lead singer! Well, I'm also a singer. I got goosebumps! Then he threw his guitar pick. I wear it all the time, see? I got it on tape too. It was crazy cool. Hey, babe. You made it. - Babe? - Hey! What's wrong? Oh, my God. Come. Sit over here. What's with all the vomiting? You didn't eat? I'm sorry, Auntie. Thank you. Here, drink this. No, don't throw it up again. You haven't eaten, have you? Oh, my. Do you have a napkin? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry about that. - Where did he go earlier, anyway? - He... He just finished band practice. And he choked on his guitar? Gosh, that was ages ago. This is the jacket you wore that day, right? A birthday present from me. - Let's not talk about age. - Okay. I think I know what to give you next. There's no need. I'm comfortable with this. Are you a new tenant? - Yes, are you the landlady? - No, I'm also a tenant. - Hans. - Leia. Can you take me to the landlady? - Sure, come in. - Okay. - Here she is. - Hans! Hello, Mom! Hello, Mom. - How are you? - I'm good. I missed you so much. Leia, meet Hans, my son. He's Abang's younger brother. - Hans. - Leia. If only the sky was always this bright. And what if there was no daytime? There would be no difference. The past, the present will have no difference. If only I could be one of those stars. 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100. Abang, don't forget about the stars we can't see. Count them too. It's so sad if they are left alone. There's one right there. Count it, Abang. 100, 101, 101. Abang! I have something for you. Something you would love. Abang? Abang? - Morning, Sir. - Morning. - Hi, Leia. - Hey. Is someone picking you up? No, I called for a cab, and it's just taking forever. - Where are you heading? - Towards Sudirman. Let me give you a ride. I'm going to Thamrin. No, thanks. My cab could get here any minute. Come on. We're going the same direction. - I guess we are. - Yeah. All right. With me, Bayu Oktara, this morning. How are you? Hopefully you are all fine. Of course! Even though the weather isn't very sunny... hans. dharmawan ANOTHER RIDE, TOMORROW? To accompany you on your journey, a hit from Dee. This is Hanya Isyarat. leai.wardoyo NO. WHAT WOULD THE OTHERS SAY? hans.dharmawan YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED... Mozart 1756 - 1791. Beethoven 1770 - 1827. Bach 1685 - 1750. That is Bach, right? - Bach 1685 -1750. - Stand up, Abang. Sitting or standing? Wake up, Senja. It's already late. Wake up. If you want to come, I'm going to the cemetery today. We'll bake extra cakes for your club's anniversary, all right? It's not for another week. But I think I'll make cone-shaped rice. That sounds special. I think... This is the first time... I see you so involved in something for quite a long time. What are you searching for in that club, anyway? You don't have to answer my question. The answer is waiting on the porch. I believe his name is Panca? Sorry to keep you waiting. No problem. This is the bicycle you ride to the meetings? Usually I only see it from afar. This bike seems to mean a lot to you. Should we start with the baking? Actually, I have another idea, if you don't mind. This is my favorite spot. I like to come here to read or look at the view. Do you see that cloud? That one. You see it? What does it look like? Is this a psychological test? Is that how you feel? There's philosophy in clouds. You know? Yeah. It's always changing shape. It has to be willing to shed rain. Then it has to comply to the law of nature. It pours into the river, flows into the sea, goes back up to the sky and turns into clouds again. But the rain never questions... why it has to leave its place in the sky and wash over the hills. That is... so beautiful. Of course it is. Because I didn't write it. I read it in a book by Larasati. I'll lend it to you. You didn't have to tell me. There was no way for me to know. But of course I had to. If we have a vision about someone, should we tell them about it? What for? As a warning to be more careful. If I tell them, I could stop something bad from happening, right? If you're supposed to warn them, you will. But if you're not supposed to, no matter how hard you try, what is supposed to happen will happen. I've been having this bad feeling about my parents this past week. Then I found out my mother is very sick. Now, what can I do? I can only pray for the best. Your parents live in Padang, right? Yeah. I have to fly there next week. Is this him? Where did I go wrong? Do you know what hurts the most? It's not the lying or the fooling around with other women, but the fact that I'm betraying myself. How did I allow him to treat me like that? It's absurd. I went out of my way to be perfect for him. I have to... I dressed up for him. I have to be more outgoing, lose weight, look pretty... All that for what? To him, I'd never be perfect. Enough. I realized one thing... when I was sick, I was so weak. I couldn't even get up. There was no one home to get me a glass of water. When I called, he didn't pick up. I called his house, and the security guard picked up. I tried his office, nothing. I sent a text, no reply. Maybe he was in a meeting. Two hours and no response! Really, I'm not asking much. I just need someone who genuinely cares for me. Someone to come over anytime when I'm sick with a glass of water. Seriously, is that too much to ask? Where were we before? We were playing a game. A game where each of us has to tell a story. What's the saddest thing that ever happened to us? Winner gets this. But I don't drink beer. Okay, what if the winner gets to tell anyone here to do what he or she wants? - Deal! - Deal! Sounds good. And he or she can't say no. Ready? Okay. - Who wants to start? - I'll start. - Okay. - Please go ahead! You see? What he's doing to me now? So unfair! People always laugh at me or talk to me like I'm a pessimist. I didn't use to be like this. In the past, someone I loved died... a month before we were supposed to get married. My fiancé. My fiancé was the real backpacker, not me. Then she got sick... and died. I was crushed and decided to travel. I went to places she went to. Why? I just wanted to see... what she saw. I wanted to feel... what she felt. I was in your shoes, once. My best friend died. He taught me about travelling. So here I am. Travelling with you guys. I used to be a party animal, hopping from club to club every weekend. One night I asked my friend to pick me up after a party. One hour, two hours. I couldn't get a hold of him. Then I found out his car crashed and he died at the scene. I travel because... I never knew who I really was. I was separated from my family by a natural disaster. Then I tried travelling with the hope of finding a place that reminds me of the place I grew up with my family. I thought you disappeared. Your speech is in a few minutes. - Do I have to? - Yes, you do. - Why don't you make the speech? - Why me? - Thank you so much. - Taja? This is Taja. - Congratulations. Hi. - Hi. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you That's Mr. Edwin's friend. - Hi! - Hey! Dear, God. Hi, how are you? Did you see Taja? Over there? One more thing. I want you to meet a very special friend of mine. She's a big fan of yours. Who is she? Hey. Thank you. - This is the artist. - Thank you. Sar? Sar? Taja, meet Saras. She also studied painting and philosophy in London. You two will find heaps to talk about, no doubt. I'll leave you two alone. Yeah? - Hello. - I have to welcome the guests. - I'm Taja. - Saras. Hey, cut it out. - Hello, Saras. Congratulations. - Thank you. Coffee? Still bitter? Yeah. I still have something I can't forget. I still have questions for you. And I will try to answer them all. Irwan is my best friend. He's like a brother to me. - Taja... - I don't want you vanishing like you did. You know that I had never lied to you. Do you love Irwan? What do you know about love? Why are you still here? Don't seduce her. This is my future wife. You can pick yours over there. We were just talking about the past. - The past? - Our past. Ours. Okay. Come, let's go there. Everyone is waiting for you. We'll see you there. Let me finish this cup. Okay. Smile. Let's sell some art! Come on. Taja. Why didn't I see Taja? Why? Maybe he got some urgent stuff. What urgent stuff? Please. What urgent stuff? - It's not okay. - It's okay. My bride. INTUITION CLUB 2ND ANNIVERSARY Thank you... for helping me out today. I should be thanking you for starting this club. Now I don't feel like a freak anymore. You're not a freak. What you have is a gift. Not everyone has that. You should be thankful. That's what my mom always says. She sends her regards. She wished you happy anniversary. Really? How is your mom, by the way? She's fine. How about you? Fine? How do we know if something is a sign or not? By looking deep within... heart and mind. By listening to yourself. We must be ready to face the answers. What if I don't like the signs I get? You just have to accept it. If you reject it, it will only wear you down. You're flying tomorrow, right? Can't you postpone it? No, I can't. My mom is getting worse. But you can't go. - I don't want you to. I dreamed... - Hey. All rivers will come home to the sea. But what's the use of visions if we can't change anything? Then why are we all here? What for? Peace be upon you. Senja. We're here to learn how to find acceptance. Once we find acceptance, we'll learn to make peace. You're lying. You just don't want to admit that we're here because we're scared. This is all just to console ourselves, right? So that we think we're fine. We don't want these visions anyway. What's the use of knowing someone close to us will die and not being able to do anything to change it? Senja. What's wrong, dear? What happened? I couldn't stop him, Mom. It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. What should happen will happen. Sometimes the best thing to do is to accept it. Everything will be all right. I died once. I fell when I was rock climbing. I don't remember anything. The only thing I remember... there was a white light. A white light? Yeah. A white light that was... very bright over a meadow that was extraordinarily vast. Strangely... I wasn't scared. All I felt was peace. I've never felt so peaceful. I woke up. It made me not want to love anything else but that eternal peace. That's what I'm searching for. Not love. Not friendship. Not family. Not even life experience. Your turn. My story? My story is about a friend who was born overseas. She was born into a poor family. Each time her mother needed to make a chicken dish, her mother would go to the market to buy chicken. But all she could afford was the back side of the chicken. So my friend grew up believing that a chicken only has a back side. She never knew it has a breast, legs or wings. The back side became her only definition of a chicken. As for me... I fell in love. I fell in love with someone whose back is the only part of him I know. Someone whose shadow is the only part of him I can enjoy. Someone I can never have. Someone whose presence is like a shooting star. A flash, and then gone. And I'll never be able to catch up. Someone... who I can only send signs to. Subtle as air, the sky, the clouds, the rain. But now I think my friend is the happiest person on earth. She savored the chicken's back because that's the only part she knew. And I'm the saddest person... because I know... what I can never have. Damn! I didn't expect you could talk like that. You're damn right. When the quiet girl speaks... she shoots right through the heart. And the winner is... drum roll, please, Al! You can handpick anyone to do whatever you want. Raga... Can you turn the light back on, please? - They're too bright. - It's cozier this way. Let her have her way. - I'll just go back to my spot. - Where are you going? It's been fun. All right, bye. Bye. Oh, my. Too bright! Now I know what his eye color is. Hazel. And it is more than enough for me. - Where are you going? - Wait a second. Mister. Hello. Good evening. My best friend When the laughter wears off Let me tell a story Too far I have climbed - I want to make copies. - No. - What? - Bro! I got lost on a mountain of illusion Please don't let me find you there Too far I have fallen down The wound hurts Deep in disappointment And now here I am I just want to sit still Sit in my space Waiting for someone With a glass of water in his hand If I think about it, Taja has always been a weirdo. He's shy. He can lock himself in his room for days. He always says no whenever I'm setting him up with girls or guys. His favorite animal is a house gecko. Just like your tattoo. He says a gecko just stays on the wall, keeping humans safe from mosquitoes. Geckoes are loyal animals even though humans take them for granted. Such an artsy-fartsy, that boy. I've long given up trying to set him up with people. I love him like a brother, a best friend. I'd give him everything. But he's basically an artist. Artists live in their own world. So do I. I have my own world. Turn off the lights, honey. A gift from Taja. HANS: HI, LEIA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M THINKING OF YOU. I'M COMING OVER. Please, Hans. Bunda. Please, come in, Bunda. I'm sorry for the mess. Have a seat, please. What I'm going to say might sound awkward. Abang and Hans... are both my sons. But... if you asked me which one loves you unconditionally... I'd say... Abang. Abang loves you... not only with his heart, but his soul. Not with what's romantic, but what's real. Hans can fall in love with other girls. But, Abang... Abang cannot. Abang loves you beyond reason. All his life. You can't know what's in people's hearts. No one can. You're not an angel... who knows what people think. He's not stupid. I agree that he's not stupid, Bunda. He will soon find out about you two. It's better that he finds out now than later. For him, now or later makes no difference. But we can't hide from him forever, Mom. If necessary, both of you hide it from him forever. This is not fair. This doesn't make sense. Do not talk about sense. And do not talk about fairness. Your rules and our rules... - don't apply to Abang. - Bunda. Hans... You don't live here. I do. I know him. You also know him, Leia. You understand, right, Leia? I'm boring you to death with my rambling? Say it again? You seem so uninterested. What's wrong? Are you sick? Because of yesterday? - Your water. - Thank you. What's wrong? TAXI Light colored... I was unable to make him stay. Like when I was unable to stop my father and brother from entering the car. THE SUBSERVIENCE OF THE CLOUDS BY: LARASATI Mom! I want one... Mommy, I want one... Yes, my dear... There will be one for you... ONE HUNDRED IS PERFECT. ONE HUNDRED AND YOU ARE BEYOND PERFECTION.
